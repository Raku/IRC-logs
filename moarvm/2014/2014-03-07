[17:48] <TimToady> that is a very fast leak on maorvm

[18:03] <jnthn> Mebbe worth valgrinding...

[18:03] <isBEKaml> OHHAI, I ran into this error, when I tried building MoarVM on Linux( Slackware - perl v5.10): http://sprunge.us/KGhQ

[18:03] <isBEKaml> does moarvm require newer perl versions?

[18:04] <jnthn> Not sure we ever laid down a requirement so far...

[18:05] * TimToady has never valground, are there any experts in the house

[18:05] <jnthn> Grrr...train is rocking a little too much on this section of hte journey for me to be able to keep looking at a screen without feeling ill :/

[18:05] <jnthn> SJ, why you no lay track flat...

[18:07] <isBEKaml> jnthn: I don't think it's really much to do with newer perl as much as asking for a newer perl module (File::Path, in this case).

[18:09] <isBEKaml> it's build/probe.pm asking for unexported/absent subs in File::Path.

[18:09] <jnthn> isBEKaml: OK. Probably whoever wrote the code had a newer version. Then, on this box I've a stock 5.16...

[18:09] <jnthn> ...with no updated modules I know of. And it's working.

[18:09] <jnthn> nwc10: Dunno if you know, given I think you worked on probe code?

[18:10] <jnthn> oh dears...

[18:10] <jnthn> src\strings\ops.c(1390) : error C2275: 'MVMCodepoint32' : illegal use of this type as an expression c:\consulting\moarvm\src\6model/reprs/MVMString.h(4) : see declaration of 'MVMCodepoint32'

[18:12] <dalek> MoarVM: 3787171 | jonathan++ | src/strings/ops.c:

[18:12] <dalek> MoarVM: Unbust MSVC build.

[18:12] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3787171d46

[18:12] <isBEKaml> Ah, it's mkpath and rmtree in my version of File::Path

[18:15] <isBEKaml> Why was the module's API changed? :/ (Modifying build/probe.pm to use mkpath and rmtree got me going, for now)

[18:20] <jnthn> TimToady: Reproduced the leak. Maybe I'll find it.

[18:22] <TimToady> it's a full fart leak :)

[18:22] *** tgt joined
[18:22] <isBEKaml> Alright, he's experiencing that in a train :-)

[18:23] <TimToady> I daresay the leak is going faster than his wifi...

[18:28] <isBEKaml> https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Path#API-CHANGES -- make_path and remove_tree use mkpath and rmtree under the hood. Can we not detect versions and fallback accordingly?

[18:46] *** lizmat joined
[18:47] <jnthn> Well, I found a leak, but not the leak...

[18:48] <TimToady> cool, find a bunch moar :)

[18:50] <lizmat> .oO( Hans Brinker to the rescue )

[18:53] <TimToady> is possible it's a space leak instead, perhaps in the eager implied by sink, if it doesn't actively throw stuff away as it's generated

[19:00] *** colomon joined
[19:05] <nwc10> I hadn't realised how "new" make_path and remove_tree are

[19:05] <nwc10> fix is to rework the code to use the older functions

[19:05] <nwc10> I certainly don't have time today

[19:05] <nwc10> I won't on Sunday

[19:05] <nwc10> I may not tomorrow either

[19:06] <nwc10> it's a SMOP for anyone who knows Perl

[19:06] <isBEKaml> nwc10: I don't :-)

[19:06] <nwc10> most of next week looking unlikely

[19:12] <isBEKaml> nwc10: It's not a big deal anyway. I got rakudo-m built and ready after changing probe.pm to use mkpath and rmtree.

[19:12] *** cognominal joined
[19:38] <nwc10> yes, but I think we should patch the probe code

[19:40] *** brrt joined
[19:45] <jnthn> OK, I managed to get a build with the CRT debug malloc that can do leak detection.

[19:45] <FROGGS> coool

[20:04] <TimToady> I'll bet my leak is "special".  :)

[20:04] <TimToady> but I'd be glad to lose that bet...

[20:08] <jnthn> Trouble is, we've not been too good at making sure stuff is freed at exit

[20:08] <jnthn> So there's a ton of leakage

[20:08] <jnthn> (Knew I'd need to take it on at some point... :))

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: efa454b | jonathan++ | src/6model/reprs/MVMContinuation.c:

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix leak of active handlers in continuation.

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM:

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: If a continuation is never resumed but it saved handlers, they would

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: never become active again and would thus be leaked.

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/efa454bd98

[20:11] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/46000f6837

[20:18] <TimToady> p5 is very picky about cleaning up when it knows it's embedded

[20:18] <TimToady> if it's not embedded, it only cleans up enough to attempt to run all DESTROYs

[20:19] <jnthn> Well, I'd rather cheat once we've learned to not cheat :)

[20:19] <TimToady> since exit is a rather efficient way to clean up the rest of 'em

[20:19] <TimToady> ayup

[20:20] *** evdivan joined
[20:20] <jnthn> I'm gonna go through this list and zap the easy ones, to try and work out where the real ones are.

[20:23] <dalek> MoarVM: 4711808 | jonathan++ | src/6model/reprs/MVMStaticFrame.c:

[20:23] <dalek> MoarVM: Don't leak static frame instruction offsets.

[20:51] *** cognominal joined
[21:00] <jnthn> Somehow, hashes leak somewhat.

[21:06] *** vendethiel left
[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: b07e028 | jonathan++ | src/6model/reprs/MVMHash.h:

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: Avoid leaking 72 bytes per MVMHash.

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM:

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: In gc_free for MVMHash, due to HASH_CLEAR clearing the head pointer,

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: we ended up never freeing the memory for the first node in a hash.

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b07e028d66

[21:22] <jnthn> TimToady: So, having cleaned up this much, I can confirm that we seem to be leaking frames.

[21:25] <jnthn> TimToady: Hm, but it doesn't seem to be enough to account for the loss

[21:26] <jnthn> ooh, nearly home...

[21:26] <jnthn> bbiab

[22:55] * lizmat hopes jnthn got home safely

[22:57] <timotimo> hm. i wonder if the leak reduction for mvmhash will cause better startup memory usage yet

[23:01] <jnthn> lizmat: Yeah, just a bit wet :)

[23:01] <jnthn> timotimo: tits

[23:01] <tadzik> what

[23:02] <jnthn> try it to see

[23:02] <jnthn> :P

[23:02] <tadzik> :D

[23:02] <jnthn> timotimo: It will probably reduce CORE.setting comp memory

[23:02] <jnthn> timotimo: 'cus we allocate and throw away a lot of hashes.

[23:05] <timotimo> that's very good.

[23:05] <timotimo> i'll try it out, actually

[23:07] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm just doing a build here too

[23:11] <timotimo> 89852maxresident - not really seeing a difference here

[23:12] <jnthn> Pretty sure CORE.setting build was lower though.

[23:12] <timotimo> oh, that

[23:12] <timotimo> should verify.

[23:12] <jnthn> yeah, I only eyeballed it.

[23:13] <timotimo> i'm verifying it now

[23:13] <timotimo> what revision should i revert moar to?

[23:13] <timotimo> Unbust MSVC build. ← this one?

[23:14] <timotimo> wowza. 620 megabytes of maxrss for setting compilation

[23:15] <timotimo> absolutely speaking, that's quite a lot of memory

[23:15] <timotimo> relatively speaking, that's probably way better than parrot

[23:15] <timotimo> oh wow. can this be real?

[23:15] <timotimo> 67.68user 0.28system 1:08.20elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 742696maxresident)k

[23:15] <timotimo> 70.31user 0.22system 1:11.00elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 619296maxresident)k

[23:16] * timotimo collects more datapoints

[23:17] <jnthn> Yes, unbust is the one.

[23:17] <jnthn> Hm, is that suggesting we went from 743 to 620 with my fixes? :)

[23:18] <timotimo> yes

[23:18] <jnthn> wow.

[23:18] <timotimo> so leak

[23:18] <timotimo> much garbage

[23:18] <jnthn> so fix

[23:19] <timotimo> at least the memory usage seems pretty stable in the "before" version

[23:23] <timotimo> the numbers seem to be legit

[23:23] <timotimo> good catch!

[23:25] * jnthn does himself a leak detecting build on his main dev machine

[23:26] <timotimo> the memory consumption numbers are quite stable

[23:28] <timotimo> there's also leakage happening caused by string decoding and/or encoding according to valgrind

[23:28] <timotimo> want me to run the analysis?

[23:28] <timotimo> i wonder how long the core setting takes when running under valgrind

[23:29] <timotimo> since we do our own allocations in our own heaps for a big chunk of all allocations, it may not be terribly slow compared to normal programs that use malloc for every little thing

[23:30] <jnthn> timotimo: I see them here too, so no need to valgrind unless you also want to go hunting. :)

[23:33] <timotimo> oke

[23:33] <timotimo> í'll do it just to find out how much longer it takes

[23:33] <timotimo> hm. usually like 20x longer, right?

[23:35] <jnthn> no idea :)

[23:36] <jnthn> TimToady: With the cruft cleared up, it's fairly clear we're leaking frames in the gather/take, which is why your example swallows so much memory.

[23:37] <TimToady> yay!

[23:37] <jnthn> mmm...rochefort 10...

[23:38] <[Coke]> so glad I get to program in perl6 and not c when jnthn is done. :)

[23:38] <jnthn> Only question now is why...

[23:40] <timotimo> why rochefort?

[23:40] <TimToady> [Coke]: well, I still note that the narcissist code equivalent to that which runs hours in Perl 6 ran in about .3 seconds in D, so we still have a ways to go...

[23:43] <jnthn> timotimo: 'cus it tastes nice! :P

[23:43] <timotimo> heh

[23:44] <timotimo> hm. now i have to go. i can't suspend the laptop during the run because that'd give me wildly exaggerated measurements

[23:44] <timotimo> ctrl-c'd it and got these numbers: ==8728==    definitely lost: 3,584,385 bytes in 98,440 blocks

[23:44] <timotimo> ==8728==    indirectly lost: 1,226,998 bytes in 9,340 blocks

[23:44] <timotimo> ==8728==      possibly lost: 54,773 bytes in 119 blocks

[23:45] <timotimo> probably just means moarvm doesn't bother cleaning up when you ctrl-c it
