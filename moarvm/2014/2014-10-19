[00:39] <japhb> Out of curiosity, when the op in question just resolves to a standard C function (like the FP math functions), why not just jit them all?  Why add one at a time?

[00:41] <timotimo> driven by need in my case

[00:42] <timotimo> feel free to add more

[00:42] <timotimo> imo having test code helps

[00:42] <japhb> Well, sure.

[00:43] <timotimo> the big integer ops need a little bit of transforming before they can be put into the jit as is

[18:09] <hoelzro> ahoy #moarvm

[18:11] <hoelzro> so I tried adding some printf debugging statement to moduleloader

[18:11] <hoelzro> nothing appears to be different =/

[18:11] <hoelzro> (btw, this is regarding https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=122773)

[18:12] <hoelzro> my only assumption is that the internal dictionary for the Example stash is being cleared or set to a new dictionary with the lazy deserialization stuff

[18:32] <lizmat> hoelzro: where did you do that?

[18:43] <hoelzro> lizmat: are you asking if I pushed that code somewhere?

[18:43] <hoelzro> or where in the source I put the debugging stuff?

[18:43] <lizmat> no, just wondering where in the source you put that

[18:43] <lizmat> indeed

[18:43] <hoelzro> src/Perl6/ModuleLoader.nqp

[18:43] <hoelzro> and src/6model/serialization.c

[18:49] <lizmat> ok, so maybe this question more belonged in #perl6  :-)

[18:50] <lizmat> fwiw, after the next release, I'll be diving into the module loader code and finally get S11 and S22 up to spec

[19:06] <timotimo> the lazy deserialisation is at a different level than that
