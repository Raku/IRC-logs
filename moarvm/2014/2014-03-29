[00:02] <japhb> jnthn: I had an excuse for the crickets.  I was teaching a promising young programmer a short history of interpreters and JITs for his future study.

[00:02] <japhb> Also: \o/ for the merge.  :-)

[00:07] <jnthn> japhb: Cool :)

[01:20] <timotimo> yay merging moar-conc

[01:22] <timotimo> jnthn: is now-ish a good point in time to consider implementing a bit of the async i/o stuff we already have on the jvm on moar?

[01:25] <timotimo> (that is: if i can figure out how to make it work at all :P)

[01:26] *** rurban joined
[01:35] <timotimo> it's especially clever to rebuild nqp and *then* git pull the important changes :P

[09:11] <dalek> MoarVM: make helper public that gives us a replaced MVMP6opaqueBody

[09:11] <dalek> MoarVM:

[09:11] <dalek> MoarVM: We need this helper in rakudo too, for example when we need the

[09:11] <dalek> MoarVM: replaced body of a list after something get mixed into it, which

[09:11] <dalek> MoarVM: results in a growth (and therefor a replacement) of the body.

[12:23] <dalek> MoarVM: Minor optimization

[12:23] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:23] <dalek> MoarVM: This helps improve startup time and reduces CORE.setting about 9KB

[12:23] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ba1c829912

[12:25] <JimmyZ> This patch needs to rebuild nqp/radkuo ...

[12:33] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/eb2ba0792b

[12:39] <FROGGS> JimmyZ: why do you rename it to MVM_p6opaque* when everything starts with MVMP6opaque?

[12:40] <dalek> MoarVM: 0b08db7 | jimmy++ | src/6model/serialization.c:

[12:40] <dalek> MoarVM: Small cleanup to serialization

[12:40] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:40] <dalek> MoarVM: [read|write]_int[16|32]_func will be removed in the near future once nqp-m gets a new bootstrap

[12:40] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0b08db7bdd

[12:42] <JimmyZ> FROGGS: Global function always starts with MVM_*

[12:42] <FROGGS> hmmm, okay

[12:43] <JimmyZ> FROGGS: I think it needs s/MVMP6opaque_initialize/MVMP_6opaque_initialize/ too

[12:43] <JimmyZ> jnthn: ^^ how do you think it?

[12:43] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Well, apart from the REPR initialize ones, which don't.

[12:43] <jnthn> But yeah, the rest do

[12:44] <JimmyZ> OK :)

[12:44] <jnthn> MVM_iter_blah, for example

[12:44] <jnthn> I'd leave the initialize ones, tbh.

[12:44] <JimmyZ> fine to me

[12:44] <jnthn> But yeah, MVM_p6opaque_real_data fits better.

[23:26] <jnthn> Expect I'll have something to push/show within the next week, perhaps within a couple of days.

[23:27] <FROGGS> I guess not only brrt is eager to see that :o)
