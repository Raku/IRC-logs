[20:20] <[Coke]> any idea why I cannot run an installed perl6-m from a build directory of another perl6-m ?

[20:20] <[Coke]> does this happen on any other OS, or just mac?

[20:24] <[Coke]> (if I move blib/ out of the way, then no error)

[20:26] <[Coke]> looks like this is expected, due to src/Perl6/ModuleLoader.nqp, adding "." & "blib" to the load path. :|

[20:27] <dalek> MoarVM: 7f5bfa8 | (Daniel Dehennin)++ | / (3 files):

[20:27] <dalek> MoarVM: Add option to configure bin target directory

[20:27] <dalek> MoarVM:

[20:27] <dalek> MoarVM: Define a new toolchain option “bindir” use it in “Makefile.in”.

[20:27] <dalek> MoarVM:

[20:27] <[Coke]> aigh, smartquotes. :)

[20:27] *** dalek joined
[20:31] <FROGGS> :o)

[20:31] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I can run perl6-m from everywhere

[20:32] <FROGGS> [Coke]: if I had to guess I'd guess that your rakudo build dir is in PATH

[20:36] <[Coke]> FROGGS: nope.

[20:37] <FROGGS> :/

[20:38] <FROGGS> [Coke]: so you are running a perl6-m from PATH within another rakudo dir, is that right?

[20:38] <[Coke]> yes.

[20:38] <[Coke]> and ModuleLoader is explicitly adding "blib" to the INC-alike, it seems.

[20:38] <FROGGS> yes...

[20:39] <FROGGS> I'd say: don't do that, at least not for now

[20:39] <[Coke]> but we only ever want that when we're running an uninstalled perl6, yes?

[20:39] <FROGGS> true

[21:04] <raiph> Am I right in thinking that moarvm does something similar to "basic block versioning"? https://github.com/maximecb/Higgs/wiki/FAQ#what-is-basic-block-versioning

[21:06] <FROGGS> raiph: I think it "only" creates a hopefully optimized version, and falls back to the original version when the hopes did not hold...

[21:07] <FROGGS> raiph: so it is not like moarvm creates a bunch of type specialized version of the same block, like V8 probably does

[21:09] <raiph> aiui the bbv ("basic block versioning"

[21:09] <raiph> is novel, not used in v8

[21:10] <FROGGS> raiph: there was talk about its implementation

[21:11] <raiph> thanks for answers

[21:13] <FROGGS> sure

[21:15] <japhb> [Coke]: I come across that all the time, as I tend to accidently be in my working rakudo source tree when I want to try something out; but my PATH (and alias) perl6 were built someplace else.  I've gotten to recognize the weird error and switch to a different shell.  :-)

[21:19] <[Coke]> I'm doing something now with a p5 script; this means I can't just drop in a p6 script and be done with it. frustrating.

[21:20] <[Coke]> I get that my request isn't normal, though, so will probably workaround it.
