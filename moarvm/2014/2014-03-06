[18:06] <rurban_> The moarvm gc looks much better than the parrot gc. Very similar to the potion gc. The gdb plugin is cool

[18:11] <[Coke]> who did that... timotimo?

[18:12] <jnthn> The gdb plugin is timotimo++

[18:13] <jnthn> Overall GC design was mine, of course standing on the shoulders of the GC handbook :)

[18:24] <[Coke]> also nwc++ for helltesting

[18:24] <[Coke]> er, nwc10++

[18:24] <jnthn> Yes, most certainly. And diakopter++ contributed stuff to the implementation also.

[18:31] <TimToady> so we link linenoise in, but we don't call it yet?

[18:31] <jnthn> TimToady: Yeah 'cus it spow prompts on Linux...

[18:32] <jnthn> TimToady: Feel free to investigate :)

[18:56] <timotimo> the next step on my gdb plugin todo list is analyzing the overflows

[18:59] <timotimo> do we have a clue how many we would be expecting?

[18:59] <jnthn> I think STs may overflow
