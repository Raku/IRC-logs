[18:35] <timotimo> oh hey brrt :)

[18:35] <timotimo> catching up on sleep after coming back from bulgaria?

[18:37] *** zakharyas joined
[18:59] <brrt> aye

[19:00] <timotimo> ah you're back online :)

[19:00] <brrt> yes :-)

[19:00] <brrt> uhm, you can haz segfault iirc?

[19:00] <timotimo> that's right

[19:01] <japhb> [Coke]: I know you said it days ago, but I still smile when I see your 'mentees: the frosh maker.' pun, having recently said goodbye to our summer mentee.

[19:01] <timotimo> it happens about 11 minutes into running the spesh_diff script on the spesh log for the core setting :(

[19:02] <brrt> oooh... that.. blows

[19:02] <timotimo> yup

[19:03] <timotimo> but it was while i was trying to get a profile done

[19:03] <timotimo> so it *could* have been due to that

[19:03] <brrt> hmm

[19:03] <timotimo> haven't tested it without the --profile, because i only ran the spesh_diff to profile it in the first place :)

[19:03] <timotimo> did you get a chance to further your work on param_* stuff?

[19:04] <brrt> no, i had to leave home and hacking wednesday afternon aleady

[19:06] <brrt> let me see if i can get that branch to crash earlier

[19:06] <timotimo> that's fine :)

[19:12] <brrt> it's possible we have a gc missassignment somewhere

[19:12] <brrt> if the value you have is garbage

[19:22] <brrt> breaks quite a few spectests, too

[19:24] <timotimo> "that" branch refers to what exactly?

[19:25] <brrt> the jit_getcodeobj branch

[19:28] <timotimo> oh, that's mine isn't it?

[19:28] <timotimo> i couldn't get anyone else to reproduce failures with it :(

[19:31] <timotimo> (except the failures that also happen without the branch)

[19:31] <timotimo> (those also happen with the branch, of course)

[19:32] *** Ven joined
[19:33] <brrt> hmmm

[19:33] <brrt> well, i can reproduce failures fortunately

[19:33] <brrt> :-)

[19:33] <brrt> albeit only in spectests

[19:34] <brrt> and if it compuer=dependent and it causes segfaults because of corrupted objects then i seriously suspect gc corruption

[19:34] <brrt> although that is still just suspicion :-)

[19:34] <timotimo> http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/53f4ba0e.5b59.14 ← so

[19:35] <brrt> i have more i think

[19:35] <brrt> but i rebased it on top of master

[19:35] <timotimo> hm, ok

[19:38] <brrt> oh i do have a little bit of a nitpick, i'm going to fix that right now

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: 74883b4 | (Bart Wiegmans)++ | src/jit/emit_x64.dasc:

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: Use nz rather than ne when testing for NULL

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM:

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: They are aliased to the same flag, so this is a nitpick;

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: however nz implies that we want to test for non-zeroness

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: and ne implies that we want to test for equality.

[19:43] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/74883b4704

[19:44] <brrt> tl;dr - use nz when testing for zero, ne for equality, it makes your intentions much clearer

[19:44] <brrt> btw timotimo++ for fixing both sp_boolify_iter_arr and sp_boolify_iter_hash

[19:46] * brrt is afk

[19:46] *** brrt left
[19:52] <timotimo> i fixed them?

[19:52] <timotimo> didn't you fix them?

[19:55] <FROGGS> who cares when it works :o)

[19:57] <timotimo> .o( ist doch egal, solang der sound gut ist! )

[19:59] <FROGGS> that covers it pretty much

[20:52] <tgt> m: say do for 1..50 { default { $_ } }

[20:53] <tgt> When using default it only prints 1 to 17

[20:53] <tgt> It works correctly with MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1

[20:53] <tgt> when * works correctly

[21:03] <tgt> (Opened a bug: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/127)

[22:12] <timotimo> i ... don't even know what default { ... } is for

[22:12] <timotimo> oh, that's for given/when, duh
