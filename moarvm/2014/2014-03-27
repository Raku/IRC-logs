[20:32] <dalek> MoarVM/moar-conc: Go with a simpler scheme that is easier to reason about, and seems to

[20:32] <dalek> MoarVM/moar-conc: be an improvement. Most important in this is giving the coordinator a

[20:37] <timotimo> jnthn: does that fix the trouble?

[20:37] <jnthn> Not all of it

[20:37] <jnthn> But it's an improvement.

[22:03] <jnthn> And the next trouble is proving hard to hunt down...

[22:04] <timotimo> yay :\

[22:27] <masak> y = -|x|

[22:36] <jnthn> Latest: it might be a gen2roots cross-thread thing.

[22:52] <jnthn> Yeah. I have a Scalar allocated on thread 1, in gen2, that points into thread 3's fromspace.

[23:08] <timotimo> huh?

[23:17] <jnthn> timotimo: yeah, that's what I'm wondering :)

[23:26] *** woolfy joined
[23:44] <jnthn> It has the "in gen2 root list" flag set but isn't actually in a root list of any thread. Tssk.

[23:45] <jnthn> Think that's all I have the energy for tonight. At least I got it narrowed down a good bit.
