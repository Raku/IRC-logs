[16:12] * TimToady wonders if OS X comes with a default umask that prevents creating an executable, hence the need for an explicit chmod +x

[16:13] <TimToady> though that wouldn't explain why a second make would work sometimes

[16:13] <TimToady> oh, ww

[18:13] <rurban> ExtUtils::Command cp is usually the culprit, dropping the -x perm

[18:22] <TimToady> thanks, it now does an explicit chmod (and also an rm, in case there was a bad symlink sitting there)

[18:24] *** cognome joined
[18:28] <[Coke]> which means it'll remake it all the time, neh?

[18:29] <TimToady> it's like a 167 byte file...

[18:30] <TimToady> though now that it's guaranteed to be a file, not a symlink, we can probably put an official dependency in so it won't remake if perl6-m hasn't changed

[18:35] <[Coke]> TimToady: no change: make: write error

[18:35] <[Coke]> and after that, "make -j9" -> does the rm, cp, chmod.
