[00:42] <timotimo> a non-optimal design is fixable, too

[00:52] <timotimo> are these objects actually supposed to be living this long?

[00:52] <timotimo> because that's a metric fuckton of MVMCode objects

[00:52] <jnthn> Well, I want to look into that too

[00:52] <timotimo> maybe that'll turn out to be enough already?

[00:52] <jnthn> I mean, the reason we get MVMCode objects is easy: you get one every time you take a closure.

[00:52] <jnthn> That's how Moar represents a closure.

[00:53] <jnthn> But the reason we have that many of them living for so long is worth looking into.

[00:54] <jnthn> Thankfully, that's not overly hard to investigate: you can look inside the MVMCode and get the static frame, which gives you a name. And if the closure is anonymous you can look outwards until you find a name. :)

[01:12] <timotimo> i kind of feel like i don't have the energy necessary to write the code to do that right now

[01:12] <timotimo> i want a sleep soon

[01:12] <jnthn> :)

[01:12] <jnthn> Same :)

[01:13] <timotimo> i have a weird mental thingie where not seeing perl6 be worked on much for longer than a day makes me a bit demotivated and slightly sad :\

[01:17] <timotimo> the last few weeks were not so terribly good in that regard :\

[01:18] <jnthn> Yeah, $dayjob threw me rather more teaching to do that I really wanted, and that combined with the travel was exhausting.

[01:18] <jnthn> *than

[01:19] <jnthn> I'd hoped to do some bits today but...really didn't have the concentration, unsurprisingly...

[01:20] <timotimo> i'm not blaming you :)

[01:20] <timotimo> since you do a whole alot per week most weeks

[01:22] <jnthn> Yeah. In 2015, I'll be making very sure Perl 6 and MoarVM get a lot of me. :)

[01:23] <jnthn> In no small part because it's what I'd really like to be doing. :)

[01:28] <timotimo> i like the sound of that
