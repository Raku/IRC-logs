[07:57] <timotimo> sergot_: could you hook up MVM_string_escape to be used in the spesh dump process?

[07:57] <timotimo> and perhaps limit the output to some finite length and include "..."?

[07:58] <timotimo> would be best if it looked like this:  lit("foobarbazquux"...)

[07:58] <timotimo> so that we can differentiate literal ... from "this string was cut off"

[08:19] <sergot_> timotimo: with pleasure! :)

[08:22] <jnthn> timotimo: MVM_string_escape will go allocating, and we aren't meant to allocate GC-able things during spesh
