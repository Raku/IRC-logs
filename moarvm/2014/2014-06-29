[20:35] <jnthn> timotimo: 34bf025

[20:37] <timotimo> i'm not sure i understand why compile_in_context can influence that

[20:39] <jnthn> It forces all lexical lookups to be done as named, rather than indexed, lookups

[20:39] <jnthn> But it wasn't meant to influce lexicals declared inside the code, just those to outside.

[20:42] <timotimo> oh, ouch

[20:43] <jnthn> Worth finding. :)

[20:46] <timotimo> sure

[20:50] <jnthn> Anyways, think that's enough performance work for this weekend :)

[20:50] <jnthn> And tomorrow I'll work on async/parallel stability.

[20:51] <FROGGS> meh, precomp bug in Archive::Tar :/ MVMArray: Unhandled slot type

[20:52] <jnthn> eek

[20:52] <jnthn> Sounds like NYI as much as anything...

[20:52] *** flussence joined
[20:54] <FROGGS> well, first I need to locate where it is in that 2287 lines long file

[20:54] <jnthn> how do these things get so long...

[20:55] <FROGGS> there is a lot of documentation in there
