[16:39] <jnthn> rurban: Was it you who suggested me as a mentor on http://wiki.enlightenedperl.org/gsoc2014/ideas for "Fix NQPLexPad for parrot threads"?

[16:40] <jnthn> Either way, anybody whose registered there, plesae remove me.

[16:40] <jnthn> Woulda been polite for whoever did it to ask.

[16:59] <rurban> sorry

[17:00] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[17:03] <rurban> yes it was me. you are the only one I could think of as you wrote this part

[17:04] <rurban> And it would be beneficial, because you still fail to see why lock-less parrot threads scale better than locking moarvm threads

[17:11] <jnthn> Your ignorance is utterly astounding. :/

[17:11] <jnthn> station &

[17:12] <timotimo> rurban: fwiw, forcing (or "encouraging", depending on your interpretation of what you did) jnthn to mentor a project for that won't necessarily make him change his mind in your favor either way

[17:21] <rurban> I just wrote: Possible mentor

[17:21] <rurban> Because I cannot think of anyone else.

[17:21] <rurban> But I forgot to ask, yes

[17:22] <timotimo> ah, i think possible mentor is more like "a student can choose from these mentors"

[17:42] *** FROGGS joined
[17:42] <[Coke]> At this point, we're at "people who are willing to mentor a student"

[17:44] <[Coke]> Looks like it's been removed. Danke.

[17:53] <[Coke]> regarding the actual work of getting rakudo-parrot to implement the concurrency stuff, I think there's enough in place now for someone to try it out - we have a working set of code running on rakudo-jvm, so we have a good idea of what we want it to look like from that end. someone "just" needs to wire the rakudo end into the parrot end.

[17:53] <[Coke]> I believe that work has already started on moarvm.

[17:54] <timotimo> we've already started parallelism stuff on moar, aye

[18:10] <rurban> so who is willing to mentor for nqp-p?

[18:15] *** tgt joined
[18:17] <FROGGS> rurban: you are talking about "Fix NQPLexPad for parrot threads" ?

[18:19] <rurban> yes

[18:20] <rurban> this is really a perl6 issue, not parrot

[18:22] <[Coke]> You'll get a slightly better response in #perl6 rather than #moarvm

[18:31] <TimToady> Mebbe.  I gave up predicting what people would do a long time ago...  :)

[18:34] <[Coke]> looking at https://github.com/perl6/nqp/issues/67 and at the nqplexpad class in nqp, I have no idea what needs to be done.

[18:35] <[Coke]> (which only tells me I ain't the guy to work on this, at least right now)

[18:51] <rurban> that's why I said only jnthn could help, realistically

[18:51] <FROGGS> rurban: I would like to mentor it, but at the same time I fear I'm unable to do so

[19:15] <TimToady> rurban: the pragmatics problem here (quite apart from the technical issues) is that you gave the /appearance/ of trying to guilt-trip jnthn into helping with something that is *way* down on his list of priorities, and most of the jnthns I know don't respond well to that sort of approach

[19:16] <TimToady> and you kinda ignored the fact that this particular jnthn has developed a bit of an allergy for parrots, so has to avoid 'em, or he starts to sneeze

[19:17] <TimToady> so realistically, no, jnthn can't help

[20:48] <masak> rurban: some tips for next time you are interested in getting someone's help: saying "because you still fail to see why [I'm right about something and you are wrong]" hasn't been known to make someone *more* eager to pitch in, ever.

[20:49] *** tgt joined
[20:49] <masak> rurban: it would have antagonized jnthn to helping you if he, you know, wanted to in the first place.

[20:51] <masak> rurban: it's nice to see you here on this channel, but it tends not to be full of people convinced of Parrot's superiority in the threading department. ;)

[21:30] <rurban> hey, I wanted to attract help for you. I don't really care for rakudo nor nqp that much

[21:31] <rurban> well, I decided to stay quiet on diakopters famous claims when he made them. It was just too off. the parrots threads author should have defended it

[21:32] <rurban> but, in summary, it's nonsense.
