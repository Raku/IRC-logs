[07:39] <nwc10> did "we" intend to fix t/spec/integration/99problems-51-to-60.t ?

[07:40] <nwc10> oh, we didn't

[07:40] <nwc10> even more odd

[07:42] <brrt> uhm, "we" probably want to fix it, "we" might not have time right now :-)

[07:42] <nwc10> "we" might have managed it because I didn' thave -Ilib

[07:42] <brrt> :-)

[07:43] <nwc10> however, I am confused as to whether this should matter

[07:43] <nwc10> use more coffee

[07:44] <brrt> my suspicion is that it matters because the one activates more spesh or more gc

[07:45] <brrt> than the other

[07:45] <brrt> the amount of spesh can be compared by diffing spesh logs

[07:45] <brrt> and the amount of gc can be manipulated with nursery sizes and / or force_gc

[10:14] <dalek> MoarVM: c12720f | jonathan++ | src/gc/finalize.c:

[10:14] <dalek> MoarVM: Set up call to finalize handler if needed.

[10:14] <dalek> MoarVM:

[10:14] <dalek> MoarVM: This means the rest can be wired up in HLL code.

[10:14] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c12720f940

[10:25] <lizmat> nine++ will be happy :-)

[10:25] <lizmat> now we just need to spec it  -)

[10:26] <timotimo> and write the HLL code to do the finalizations ...

[10:32] *** ashleydev joined
[11:49] <nine> lizmat: happy indeed :) Already working on tests that will use this.

[20:18] * timotimo is mildly annoyed at libuv

[20:19] <FROGGS> timotimo: I bet this problem is not covered by their tests

[20:20] <FROGGS> (in case there is a testsuite)

[20:20] <timotimo> i sincerely hope there is one

[20:20] <timotimo> it'd surprise me if there wasn't

[20:20] <FROGGS> what sucks more is that my osx installation just panicked, so I'll have trouble hunting this issue down

[20:20] <timotimo> maybe they do it like we test moarvm: by having the tests be tests for node.js?

[20:28] <FROGGS> daxim: you should package the revision before this reverts... I hope the issue is fixed before the next release

[20:34] *** TimToady joined
[20:39] <[Coke]> as long as you're not packaging for OS X. :)
