[09:50] <timotimo> jnthn: should i add code to decrement the usage counters from the facts database to MVM_manipulate_del_ins?

[09:51] <timotimo> and the same in reverse for insert_ins?

[09:54] <timotimo> i think that'd be necessary to remove the wval lookup for the type we compare to in an istype

[09:54] <timotimo> otherwise i can just manually decrement in optimize_istype

[09:58] <timotimo> hm, will nqp::istype sometimes require the instance to be inspected rather than the type itself being enough?

[09:58] <timotimo> i'll probably have to check what exactly the type of the to-check-against thing is and only allow "simple" things to have the specialization to be applied to them

[10:05] <timotimo> hm, istype_cache_only unfortunately doesn't give different results for "no cache found" vs "this is definitely not of that type"

[12:50] <nwc10> FROGGS: "you" might be wanting to extend the implementation of that with the code from Perl 5 which figures out absolute path on a bunch of OSes

[12:50] <nwc10> but that's a nice-to-have

[12:59] <FROGGS> nwc10: question is: does moarvm run on these OSes? because I don't wanna implement broken stuff for OSes that I cannot test on

[13:00] <nwc10> linux, yes

[13:00] <nwc10> FreeBSD, last I checked, yes

[13:00] <lizmat> maybe just leave a comment to check the Perl 5 source when needed ?

[13:00] <nwc10> Solaris, I think so

[13:00] <nwc10> OS X, yes

[13:00] <FROGGS> okay, I have most of them in virtual boxes...

[13:11] *** LLamaRider joined
[13:21] <nwc10> I think that the "bigger" problem is that as soon as someone tries to package MoarVM for Debian they are going to hit portability problems

[13:21] <nwc10> right now, I think that it only runs on "both kinds of architecture"

[13:21] <nwc10> x86 *and x86_64

[13:21] <nwc10> it should (at least) run on all little endian.

[13:21] <nwc10> and hopefully not much work to get big endian too

[13:24] <xiaomiao> all two users will appreciate the effort ;)

[13:25] * xiaomiao hasn't hasn't seen any requests for any perl6-related stuff outside of both x86 flavours

[13:25] <nwc10> all two users on what?

[13:25] <nwc10> aha yes.

[13:25] <nwc10> >2 million Raspberry Pis shipped.

[13:26] <nwc10> aynway, point is that it likely won't get packaged for Debian if it's less portable than Parrot

[13:26] <xiaomiao> on Gentoo I'm aware of at least one user of rakudo

[13:26] <xiaomiao> so I guess there's not much demand yet

[13:27] <nwc10> not yet. No star release yet for a backend with supported concurrency

[13:27] <nwc10> and Perl 5 is still faster

[13:27] <nwc10> and no, we're not going to slow down Perl 5 to help :-)

[13:27] <xiaomiao> herp :)

[13:28] <xiaomiao> just saying, I've not noticed any actual usage, so portability doesn't even seem to be an urgent problem

[13:28] <nwc10> yes, agree with where you're coming from

[13:28] <nwc10> but I think it's kind of a bootstrapping problem

[13:28] <nwc10> my hunch is that there won't be packages until portability is better

[13:28] <nwc10> and without packages, there won't be (as) many users

[13:30] <xiaomiao> hehe

[13:30] <xiaomiao> well, I've been keeping things up to date on gentoo ... even if I don't have a use for perl6 yet

[13:31] <nwc10> that's useful. thanks for doing that

[13:32] <xiaomiao> I collect weird languages ... j, opendylan, perl6 ...

[13:33] <xiaomiao> in terms of "being good upstream" the perl6 crowd is pretty much a rolemodel, with working tarballs 'n stuff

[14:04] <FROGGS> nwc10: back to execname: the goal *is* to return an absolut path so I will steal from P5, though, we need a real nqp/perl6 binary first instead of a shell sript

[14:05] <nwc10> I don't know how to do it on Win32, but I think that something in win32/*.c does

[16:57] <timotimo> great

[16:58] <timotimo> now i implemented actually turning the istype into a set and it giveo Type check failed in binding; expected 'Int' but got 'Int'

[16:59] <jnthn> You probably want to turn it into a const_i64

[17:11] <timotimo> ah

[17:11] <timotimo> that kinda makes sense :)

[17:11] <jnthn> timotimo: Just done some sketching of a lex => loc algo.

[17:11] <jnthn> I *think* I can do it in one trip down the tree.

[17:12] <jnthn> Collecting info down, lowering/flattening on way up.

[17:12] <jnthn> With careful unioning.

[17:12] <timotimo> that sounds nice :)

[17:13] <jnthn> Well, ideas usually do, but I need to code it to see if it will be nice.

[17:13] <jnthn> I think I'll take dinner, and then see what energy I have :)

[17:13] <jnthn> (Slept badly last night, then taught all day, so may be zombie after dinner.)

[17:14] <jnthn> timotimo: About your sp_get_arg_o crash: you mighta been missing validation of register type compat.

[17:14] <jnthn> timotimo: That is, you can only sp_get_arg_o if the callsite says you're being passed an o

[17:15] <jnthn> The required args code carefully checks for that.

[17:15] <jnthn> i need to look more carefully at what you ended up with to see if that's the issue, but it may be.

[17:16] <jnthn> Anyway, I haz an appetite so I'm gonna go eat :)

[17:44] <timotimo> i thought i put checking code in there, too?

[17:44] <timotimo> that'd make sense

[19:03] <timotimo> jnthn: what would introducing the fact that we know the literal value of a register to the fact database look like?

[19:03] <timotimo> would i have to box an int for that?

[19:04] <jnthn> wtf

[19:04] <jnthn> no!

[19:04] <timotimo> well, it has a slot for a MVMObject *

[19:05] <jnthn> You just an a .i64 slot to the union.

[19:05] <timotimo> and a flag to say "it's an i64"?

[19:05] <jnthn> No

[19:05] <jnthn> You don't need it.

[19:05] <timotimo> oh, duh

[19:05] <timotimo> the register is typed

[19:05] <jnthn> You already know the types of all the...right :)

[19:05] <jnthn> And the bytecode was validated

[19:05] <timotimo> i'm not a smart man all the time

[19:05] <jnthn> Well, my "wtf" was more a "argh no" ;)

[19:06] <timotimo> it's all right :)

[19:06] <jnthn> Because if the specializer allocates we're...in trouble.

[19:06] <jnthn> (Does a GC allocation, that is.)

[19:06] <jnthn> I was just seeing the bugs already :)

[19:06] <timotimo> fair enough :)

[19:18] * jnthn makes branch, opens Optimizer.nqp

[19:19] <timotimo> jnthn: do you think collapsing cascading sets would be worth anything yet?

[19:19] <timotimo> as in: you turn some deconts into sets, but could just as well just re-name registers instead

[19:19] <FROGGS> hmmmm, looks like I have an nqp-m ELF binary now...

[19:19] <timotimo> oooh!

[19:19] <timotimo> a fakecutable?

[19:19] <FROGGS> no, not very faky

[19:20] <timotimo> well, i think that's the name for it, though?

[19:20] <jnthn> timotimo: I'd pondered that.

[19:20] <jnthn> timotimo: I think you can prove it's OK off usage counts but I was worried about BB spanning.

[19:20] <FROGGS> what is moarvm's binary?

[19:20] <jnthn> timotimo: That is, I couldn't convince myself the naive thing was safe.

[19:22] <timotimo> ah, ok

[19:22] <timotimo> i thought that's what SSA is for :P

[19:22] <FROGGS> timotimo: I took MoarVM's main.c, hardcoded the args we put in the nqp-m.sh, and compiled it to nqp-m ELF

[19:23] <timotimo> ah

[19:23] <timotimo> that's cute

[19:23] <jnthn> timotimo: Yeah. I think it *is* safe, something bothered me.

[19:23] <FROGGS> so we can properly get its executable name (and then its absolute path), and it is easier to run using gdb or valgrind

[19:23] <jnthn> timotimo: I was probably just tired.

[19:24] <jnthn> timotimo: 'cus I can't think of it now.

[19:24] <timotimo> oke :)

[19:25] <timotimo> FROGGS: next step would be to link the .moarvm files it needs into the binary itself :)

[19:25] <FROGGS> timotimo: hmmm

[19:25] <FROGGS> :o)

[19:26] <FROGGS> would be nice to include the modules... but, well, not now :o)

[19:26] <benabik> If you want to rename/remove registers, I _think_ you still need def-use information in SSA.  It’s just that the def-use links are very simply.

[19:26] <timotimo> mhm

[19:26] * benabik is currently taking a compiler optimization course.

[19:27] <jnthn> benabik: Well, there's one def :)

[19:27] <jnthn> timotimo: Oh! I remembered it.

[19:28] <jnthn> timotimo: It was de-opt I was concerned about.

[19:28] <timotimo> oh?

[19:28] <timotimo> because we deopt right in the middle of code, yes?

[19:28] <jnthn> Well, we can know the risk points.

[19:29] <benabik> jnthn: Like I said: simple.  :-)  But uses can be in any block the def dominates, so you still ned to have it.

[19:29] <jnthn> Basically, anything invokey.

[19:29] <jnthn> benabik: Aye, agree.

[19:29] <timotimo> an opt for later, then

[19:30] * benabik tried to implement a simple copy propigation step in a toy compiler, found it was more complex than expected.

[19:53] <timotimo> yes

[19:53] <timotimo> but i can use copy_facts :)

[19:53] <timotimo> oh, it really copies everything forever

[19:54] <timotimo> should my code stay the same or copy the fact completely?

[19:58] <timotimo> mhm

[20:09] <timotimo> ah

[20:09] <timotimo> yeah, that'd be important :)

[20:09] <jnthn> Once we do *that*, Rakudo's bind lowering will then mean we can take advantage of istype elimination for the bind type checks.

[20:09] <timotimo> should i try to build constant propagation for more ops? like lt/gt perhaps?

[20:09] <jnthn> Only if you can test them.

[20:09] <timotimo> test as in make test cases that show if it's correct?

[20:14] <timotimo> i thought so, too

[20:14] <timotimo> waiting on the spesh diff output now :)

[20:17] <timotimo> oh, my test probably didn't succeed because it wasn't using native ints

[21:29] <timotimo> er no

[21:29] <timotimo> the other way around though :P

[21:37] <jnthn> I've got something that gets through the build and passes many of the NQP tests

[21:37] <jnthn> Something is a bit off as something is busted with string escapes

[21:37] <jnthn> including interpolation

[21:43] <timotimo> oh, that's interesting

[21:43] <jnthn> Oh, I found it.

[21:43] <timotimo> does it make a funny anectode? :)

[21:43] <timotimo> anecdote*

[21:44] <jnthn> No, it tells us that we really, really, should fix the optimizer to walk embedded blocks in regexes.

[21:45] <timotimo> ah

[21:45] <timotimo> yes, it really should.

[21:45] <timotimo> i special-cased blocks-in-regexes for my lex2local search thingie

[21:45] <timotimo> but that's not sane at all.

[21:45] <jnthn> But I think I can work around it for now my poisoning the whole block var state stack.

[21:45] <timotimo> but the optimizers will have to pass data back and forth

[21:45] <timotimo> that's what i had implemented early on, yeah

[21:45] <jnthn> Well, if you pass the optimizer instnace into the regex one then you'll be fine.

[21:45] <jnthn> It should just call back into it later.

[21:46] <timotimo> "found a regex? oh, i'll just forget about optimizing, then"

[21:47] <jnthn> ok, now I'm down to 2 failing tests

[21:47] <timotimo> in nqp?

[21:47] <jnthn> yeah

[21:47] <timotimo> mhm

[21:48] * timotimo is playing violent vidya games and can't develop right now

[22:03] <timotimo> enough of that for now

[22:09] <jnthn> timotimo: OK, pushed my hacking.

[22:10] <timotimo> cool

[22:10] <timotimo> it's still at 2 failing test files?

[22:10] <jnthn> No

[22:11] <jnthn> It passes all NQP tests and builds a Rakudo that passes sanity tests.

[22:11] <timotimo> yay!

[22:11] <timotimo> i like the sound of that!
