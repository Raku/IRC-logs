[07:03] <timotimo> Ã¶good catch (i think)

[07:11] <timotimo> i shall implement cos_n and sin_n (and tan_n i suppose) today, because the former two are used in my program %)

[07:12] <japhb> CDD wins again ...

[07:59] <timotimo> these functions are fortunately absurdly easy to implement in the jit :)

[08:04] <JimmyZ> .oO(JIT is absurdly easy..)
