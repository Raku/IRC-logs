[01:18] <japhb> Are there any segfault/crash bugs that made it to an actual nqp-m or r-m release (as opposed to only existing within a development cycle)?  I can use tests for them to validate my stress testing code ....

[01:34] <timotimo> i hope not! :P

[01:34] <timotimo> but you can get segfaults manually

[01:35] <timotimo> like, for exapmle, you can box_I the value 0 into OpaquePointer and do stuff with it :)

[09:17] <FROGGS> tadzik: when you have time, can we muse about the connection of cpandatesters to github issues/RT?

[12:25] <timotimo> now that i actually look at this stuff, things get a tiny bit more complicated

[12:26] <timotimo> because the argument to nativecallinvoke is - at least in zavolaj - self, which is the role that boxes the nativecall object

[12:26] <timotimo> so i have a little piece of indirection between spesh and the native call body that i should be inspecting

[18:00] <FROGGS_> tadzik: :P

[18:01] <FROGGS_> tadzik: it would be awesome if we could link cpanda test reports to github issues.... like you can reference a commit

[18:01] <FROGGS_> tadzik: though, I don't know how possible that is

[18:02] <FROGGS_> tadzik: at least we should allow issue tracker links to bug reports, so one can see if a problem is already handled or not

[18:02] <FROGGS_> for my P5 modules I often look again and again over test reports, because I cannot see that I already made a ticket for it

[18:28] <tadzik> heh, for that to be useful I need to write myself that tool to browse though github bugs in a sensemaking manner

[18:28] <tadzik> as in "show me open bugs in the repos created by me?

[18:28] <tadzik> s/\?$/"/

[18:28] <tadzik> it's all I care about, and there's either no way at all or a very tricky way to achieve that

[18:32] <FROGGS_> I would like to link to issues manually

[18:32] <FROGGS_> so I'd like to have some fields attached to a test report that I can edit

[20:15] <timotimo> i wonder if doing a full collection after having done a whole bunch of collections that have promoted almost nothing would make future collections faster because it potentially knocks out things in the gen2?
