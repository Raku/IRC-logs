[10:45] <timotimo> the "serialized blob in the string heap" thing is from QASTCompilerMAST's deserialization_code method

[12:57] <JimmyZ_> obj_facts->usages--  # usages means version, right?

[12:58] <JimmyZ_> and I don't known what MVM_spesh_use_facts does

[12:58] <JimmyZ_> *know

[13:08] *** vendethiel joined
[13:23] <jnthn> No, it's not about version, it's about how many things use that version

[13:23] <jnthn> Facts are held per version

[13:43] *** vendethiel joined
[13:44] <JimmyZ_> oh

[13:49] <JimmyZ_> what about MVM_spesh_use_facts?

[13:51] <JimmyZ_> I see obj_facts->usages-- always with MVM_spesh_use_facts(..., obj_fact);

[14:16] *** vendethiel joined
[15:04] <jnthn> usages is about the variable the fact descibes

[15:04] <jnthn> use_facts is saying "I'm using this fact fro something"

[15:04] <jnthn> And controls guard emission

[16:39] <timotimo> .tell JimmyZ_ if we manage to get the number of superfluous set instructions that are created from QASTCompilerMAST down a little, we'll get benefits all over the whole system: fewer temp register means smaller frame objects, smaller facts database in spesh, fewer registers kept alive because they have to survive until they hit a deopt point, ...

[16:40] <timotimo> so if you want a "little" project, go for it :)
