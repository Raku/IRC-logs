[16:45] <dalek> MoarVM: ceil_n and floor_n should return n64, not i64.

[16:45] <dalek> MoarVM:

[16:45] <dalek> MoarVM: Otherwise we end up with bogus and incorrectly typed results.

[17:25] <[Coke]> note that xcode DOES support a version of the sanitizer, just not the standard one.

[17:26] <[Coke]> Try using -faddress-sanitizer instead of -fsanitize=address. Apple's version appears to be based on an older version of CLANG, and if you run clang --help, the sanitizers are all of this form in this version.

[17:26] <[Coke]> (from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16130191/clang-address-sanitizer-on-osx)

[17:35] <dalek> MoarVM: 6c6fe79 | (Tobias Leich)++ | Configure.pl:

[17:35] <dalek> MoarVM: pass -faddress-sanitizer when --asan is set, [Coke]++

[17:44] <[Coke]> FROGGS: I had tried that, and it didn't work here. :)

[17:44] <[Coke]> Did you test that?

[17:45] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I can't...

[17:45] <FROGGS> how did that fail?

[17:46] <[Coke]> I don't remember, but there's a reason I didn't ever commit that.

[17:47] <FROGGS> --asan fails on osx atm anyway, so I think I did not break anything at least

[17:49] <FROGGS> okay, it looks like you need to build a newer version of clang, and then my patch will work
