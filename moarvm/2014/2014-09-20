[13:38] * JimmyZ wonders what ni branch is

[13:46] <timotimo> well, i can already tell what it'll be for, i think :3

[13:46] <timotimo> and it makes me quite happy

[13:59] <JimmyZ> what'll be for?

[13:59] <JimmyZ> :)

[14:05] <timotimo> things like my int $foo = 1; $foo++

[14:06] <timotimo> and proper native integer arrays

[14:11] <JimmyZ> oh

[14:11] <JimmyZ> which is nice.

[14:13] <timotimo> yup

[14:14] <timotimo> and accessors for native attributes

[14:17] * JimmyZ also wonders how much performance esc analysis  will helps, from java's views, it will make some codes about 5x faster.

[14:17] <JimmyZ> *help

[14:17] <timotimo> could, yeah

[14:18] <timotimo> in tight loops, it can pretty much throw out the garbage collector all together :P

[14:18] <timotimo> do you know how to investigate how or where a method or a given block allocates stuff?

[14:19] <timotimo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Cursor.pm#L21 - the block starting here allocates a massive amount of Int objects

[14:19] <timotimo> but in the spesh for MATCH i can't see a single hllboxtype_i or box_i ...

[14:27] * JimmyZ doesn't know...

[15:21] <jnthn> Yes, timotimo guessed right about the branch that says ni. :)

[15:21] <jnthn> (ni = native improvements)

[15:21] <timotimo> hooray!

[15:22] <jnthn> It'll be a week and a half before I'm really digging deep into it (when I'm back from China), but figured I could start exploring and pondering a bit this week and sketch in some of the pieces I'll need.
