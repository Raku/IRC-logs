[00:33] <jnthn> I maded MoarVM a website; once DNS changes are done, it's at http://www.moarvm.org/

[00:34] <timotimo> i see it there already

[00:34] <timotimo> bootstrap: always pretty

[00:34] <jnthn> Yeah. safe, easy choice :)

[00:35] <tadzik> :) nice

[00:35] <jnthn> And easy for others to hack on.

[00:35] <timotimo> it's on github, eh?

[00:35] <jnthn> yeah

[00:35] <timotimo> moarvm.github.io is the name of the repo?

[00:35] <jnthn> no

[00:35] <jnthn> oh, wait

[00:35] <jnthn> It's not hosted on github, no

[00:36] <jnthn> But the site source is at https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org

[00:36] <jnthn> I didn't shove an auto-deploy thingy in yet.

[00:36] <timotimo> oke

[00:37] <timotimo> i may have a closer look some time soon :)

[00:37] <jnthn> Improvements, to content or beauty, are welcome.

[00:37] <jnthn> Also, we can easiily point people at the *correct* tarballs now

[00:37] <jnthn> Not the broken Github-generated ones.

[00:38] <jnthn> timotimo: I see you're Feb Rakudo release manager. So, please ensure that the release announcement gets a link to moarvm.org and/or the right tarball. So folks hopefully will land on the right one.

[00:38] <timotimo> excellent.

[00:38] <timotimo> i'll see to it :)

[00:38] <jnthn> \o/

[00:39] <timotimo> i think the footer of the page ought to give a bit more breathing space

[00:39] <hoelzro> jnthn++

[00:39] <hoelzro> Moar just needs a logo now =)

[00:39] <timotimo> other than that i like it a lot :)

[00:40] <jnthn> timotimo: Yeah, I agree on the footer. I was looking to see if bootstrap let me have a horizontal line or so above it, but didn't see one.

[00:40] <tadzik> maybe alot should be the logo

[00:40] <timotimo> do you know the short movie or photorealistically rendered thingie with slugs that unfold their shells to reveal jets and stuff? :3

[00:40] <tadzik> :D

[00:40] <tadzik> yep

[00:40] <timotimo> jnthn: i'll look closer tomorrow, i think

[00:40] <jnthn> Weren't we going with a chimera? :)

[00:40] <timotimo> so tomorrow i'll write the weekly changes and see to it that i can prepare the release a tiny bit

[00:40] <hoelzro> tadzik: haha, I love it

[00:41] <timotimo> the alot isn't ours, unfortunately

[00:41] <timotimo> the question is: is alot more than moar or less?

[00:42] <jnthn> .oO( So long as the logo doesn't end up being a hungry-looking lolcat with MOAR written on it... )

[00:47] <hoelzro> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/574/moar-cat.jpg

[00:47] <hoelzro> actually

[00:47] <hoelzro> this one's better

[00:47] <hoelzro> http://www.titaniumteddybear.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moar-because.jpg

[00:47] <timotimo> jnthn: i'm considering just putting a local.css in there and giving <footer> a padding-top of a few em

[00:47] <timotimo> heh.

[00:48] <jnthn> timotimo: wfm

[00:48] <timotimo> i need some noms now :o

[00:48] <jnthn> hoelzro: lol

[00:48] <timotimo> http://subtlepatterns.com/?s=dark ‚Üê and maybe a background from here

[00:48] <jnthn> Shoulda known the internet already has a lot of those :)

[00:49] <jnthn> timotimo: OK...though some of those make my eyes argh

[00:50] <timotimo> of course

[00:50] <timotimo> there's a big selection.

[00:52] <timotimo> hmm

[00:52] <timotimo> nothing in particular stands out as excellent

[00:53] <hoelzro> timotimo: your trimming MoarVM work - is it in master now?

[00:55] <timotimo> yes

[00:55] <timotimo> though hardly noticable ;)

[00:55] *** ggoebel1116 joined
[00:55] <timotimo> though the nqp optimization that turns lexicals into locals isn't in yet

[00:56] <hoelzro> that's fine

[00:56] <timotimo> as i want to do the block inlining thing first

[00:56] <hoelzro> I just want to build the docs and see how memory/speed have improved

[00:56] <jnthn> hoelzro: Did you build them since nwc10++'s patch that shrunk each object by 4/8 bytes?

[00:56] <timotimo> it would make me happy if you had a measurable improvement to point out :)

[00:56] <hoelzro> jnthn: probably not

[00:56] <hoelzro> it's been a few weeks

[00:57] <hoelzro> well, probably almost a month

[00:57] <jnthn> Ah, then that will also help :)

[00:57] <hoelzro> =)

[00:57] <hoelzro> last time it was 8 minutes, 600MB RAM, I think

[00:57] <jnthn> In other good news, I think I've a patch that resolves the Panda issue.

[00:57] <hoelzro> I could check the logs =)

[00:57] <hoelzro> jnthn: the serialization one?

[00:58] <jnthn> hoelzro: yes.

[00:58] <timotimo> F Yeah! :))

[00:58] <hoelzro> \o/

[00:58] * hoelzro wonders if that will also fix the mysterious URI testing bug

[00:59] <jnthn> Doing a clean build with the patch, then spectest.

[00:59] <hoelzro> sweet

[01:00] <jnthn> I should probably warn everyone that I'm somewhat behind with the parallel/async course I'm currently working on at $dayjob, so my tuit supply for the next week could be...interesting.

[01:00] <hoelzro> care to upload an early adopter patch? =]

[01:00] <jnthn> hoelzro: It'll be < 5 mins until the push...can you wait? :)

[01:00] <hoelzro> yes

[01:00] <hoelzro> I'm just excited =)

[01:00] * jnthn can spectest Moar in < 5 mins :)

[01:01] <timotimo> <3

[01:01] <jnthn> But I want that number to shrink :)

[01:01] <timotimo> so does everybody else ;)

[01:01] <jnthn> (no, *not* by buying a 24-core Apple trashcan... :))

[01:01] <timotimo> :D

[01:03] <timotimo> in case someone missed it: i really want to get moar's memory usage baseline to shrink drastically

[01:03] <hoelzro> timotimo++

[01:03] <jnthn> timotimo: That also is very desirable.

[01:03] <timotimo> doesn't mean i'll be the one who causes that to happen ;)

[01:04] <timotimo> nqp-m -e 'say 1' clocks in at about 20 megs of maxrss

[01:05] <timotimo> python takes only 4 megabytes to print 1 ;)

[01:05] <timotimo> and it has more features than nqp does, doesn't it? :P

[01:05] <timotimo> well, it doesn't have the regex engine loaded from the beginning

[01:06] <jnthn> Or 6model, or... :)

[01:07] <jnthn> hoelzro: pash

[01:09] <hoelzro> \o/

[01:10] <jnthn> hoelzro: btw, I fixed https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121213 - don't suppose you might be able to add a spectest and close the ticket? :)

[01:12] <hoelzro> jnthn: can do =)

[01:12] <hoelzro> I don't think I have permissions to close the ticket, though

[01:12] <hoelzro> and where would the test fail under?

[01:13] <jnthn> fail? or fall? :)

[01:13] <hoelzro> fall

[01:13] <jnthn> Probaly catch.t, in S04

[01:13] <hoelzro> =)

[01:14] <hoelzro> btw, the record to beat is 829 MB

[01:14] <hoelzro> for MoarVM building docs

[01:14] <timotimo> the ram's too damn high!

[01:15] <hoelzro> this time it took 815 =/

[01:15] <timotimo> oh well :|

[01:16] <hoelzro> it could unrelated changes

[01:16] <hoelzro> *could be

[01:16] <hoelzro> damn, I'm tired.

[01:16] <hoelzro> jnthn: did you push that serialization fix up?

[01:16] <timotimo> yeah, it's in nqp

[01:16] <jnthn> hoelzro: Yes, it was in NQP reop

[01:16] <timotimo> you missed it by not looking at #perl6 :D

[01:16] <hoelzro> ah, ok

[01:16] <jnthn> hoelzro: Didn't bump Rakudo. Should I?

[01:16] <hoelzro> nah, i'ts cool

[01:16] <timotimo> the bumps will happen soon anyway, as it's release week :)

[01:25] *** jnap joined
[01:26] <hoelzro> jnthn: no go on your fix for URI =(

[01:27] <jnthn> hoelzro: Ah, that must be something else then...

[01:28] <hoelzro> it's an interesting problem

[01:28] *** woosley joined
[01:28] <jnthn> If you can golf it, that's very helpful

[01:29] <jnthn> Anyways, hopefully the fix I did means we get Panda...

[01:29] <hoelzro> I'll see what I can do

[01:29] <hoelzro> this is a bad week for me and development

[01:35] <jnthn> 'k

[01:35] <jnthn> May be for me too...

[01:35] <jnthn> I should sleep...

[01:35] <jnthn> 'night, #moarvm

[01:37] <hoelzro> night

[01:37] * hoelzro goes to bed as well

[19:31] <ingy> moritz: hi

[19:32] <ingy> moritz: were you asking about my subrepo thing the other day?

[19:33] <moritz> ingy: yes

[19:33] <ingy> https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo#readme

[19:34] <moritz> ingy: yes, I found that

[19:34] <ingy> I finally got the main commands (clone/pull/push) working/tested yesterday

[19:35] <ingy> I need to use it heavily for a while, but I think it's going to be the solid answer to sub* stuff

[19:36] <ingy> https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/da04191fbdc612ff2fef (just switched a repo from submodules to subrepos)

[19:36] <ingy> I worked hard to make it not muck up your history

[19:37] <ingy> subtree history gets ugly fast

[19:37] <ingy> and is just a terrible plugin in general :\

[19:38] *** tgt joined
[19:43] <ingy> moritz: do you use submodules much?

[19:49] <moritz> ingy: I use them occasionally

[19:50] <moritz> (and usually regret it; like when 'git archive' simply ignores them)

[20:08] <ingy> moritz: maybe give subrepo a try. I think it should take away all that pain. :)

[20:50] <masak> subrepo looks interesting.
