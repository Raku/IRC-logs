[13:04] <PerlJam> So ... how do MoarVM releases generally work?  (I'm starting the Rakudo release process and need a MOAR_REVISION for NQP)

[13:15] <[Coke]> usually, jnthn does it.

[13:15] <[Coke]> is there a doc in the repo telling us what to do?

[13:16] <JimmyZ> see moarvm/docs

[13:16] <JimmyZ> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/release_guide.md

[13:18] <PerlJam> I guess I can cut a moar release too (unless there's some reason I shouldn't?)

[13:18] <PerlJam> Though item #2 in the release guide seems a little circular to me  ;)

[13:20] <JimmyZ> hmm, the guide didn't mention to update Changelog :P

[13:20] <PerlJam> oh ... I don't even know if I have a commit bit for the MoarVM repo.

[13:21] <PerlJam> (I'm guessing not)

[13:25] <PerlJam> is moar normally built with JIT support?

[13:28] <brrt> aye, today it is

[13:29] <PerlJam> So ... should I do a PR for the releasey bits (tagging and such)?  Or would someone give me a commit bit for MoarVM?  Or ... does someone else want to do the release?

[13:30] <PerlJam> Even if I can do the release, someone else is going to have to upload the tarball

[13:30] <FROGGS> PerlJam: only jnthn can upload the tarball me thinks

[13:54] <JimmyZ> jnthn++ and pmichaud++ is the owner

[15:39] <PerlJam> FROGGS: who can hand out commit bits?  (Or could you or someone else do a moarvm release?)

[15:40] <FROGGS> PerlJam: I could prepare a release, but I cannot upload the tarball

[15:40] <PerlJam> that would be awesome (for me)

[15:40] <FROGGS> k

[15:40] <PerlJam> at least get the 2014.10 tag in the repo

[15:41] <FROGGS> PerlJam: that should be done in at max 2.5 hours

[15:42] <PerlJam> thanks.

[15:43] <FROGGS> brb

[15:53] <TimToady> We have to do three things for 6.0: GLR, NFG, NSA...and a fanatical devotion to unfudging tests...

[15:55] <TimToady> well...almost...

[15:55] <PerlJam> .oO( The NSA controls Perl 6?!?! )

[15:56] <[Coke]> S99:NSA?

[15:56] <synopsebot> Link: http://perlcabal.org/syn/S99.html#NSA?

[15:58] <[Coke]> I know what NFG is; what does it buy us? faster unicode strings handling?

[15:58] <[Coke]> nicer API for the users?

[15:59] <JimmyZ> NSA = No Such Authority :P

[16:00] <PerlJam> [Coke]: I've tended to think of it as "correcter code" since we'll be able to compare characters to characters without having to worry about multiple decompositions.

[16:00] <JimmyZ> oh, and ESC

[16:01] <[Coke]> ... crap, wrong window.

[16:01] <[Coke]> but PerlJam++

[16:01] <JimmyZ> someone may like this: http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization

[18:23] <dalek> MoarVM: 51b5a6b | (Tobias Leich)++ | VERSION:

[18:23] <dalek> MoarVM: bump version to 2014.10

[18:23] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/51b5a6b459

[18:24] <FROGGS> http://froggs.de/perl6/MoarVM-2014.10.tar.gz

[18:25] <FROGGS> jnthn / pmichaud: please upload that tarball to moarvm.org

[18:25] <FROGGS> PerlJam: done

[18:25] <PerlJam> FROGGS: danke

[18:26] <FROGGS> PerlJam: you're welcome :o)

[18:26] <FROGGS> PerlJam: but please keep in mind: no release announcement as long as the tarball is not up

[18:26] <PerlJam> aye

[18:27] <FROGGS> (I failed this twice)

[18:27] <[Coke]> does the moar tarball go on rakudo.org?

[18:27] <FROGGS> no, moarvm.org

[18:28] <[Coke]> "Rakudo on Parrot may have a small edge, but that is changing fast". changed already, yes?

[19:47] <jnthn> Whoa, I was so tired after the travel and walking by the sea yesterday I totally forgot about the release...

[19:48] <jnthn> FROGGS_: The tarball is now in place

[19:48] <jnthn> FROGGS++

[19:48] <FROGGS_> \o/

[19:49] <jnthn> FROGGS_: You're already a committer for the website repo, but I can happily do that too...

[19:49] <FROGGS_> jnthn: do what?

[19:49] <FROGGS_> am I able to upload a tarball?

[19:50] <FROGGS_> ahh, no, you are talking about the version info on the page

[19:51] <jnthn> Right, the web pages

[19:51] <jnthn> I was logged into the server hosting it so just wget'd the tarball into the right directory :)

[19:51] <jnthn> ooh, the sun just came out...

[19:51] <FROGGS_> I can fiddle with the page in a bit :o)

[19:52] * jnthn glances the ChangeLog and is happy we managed to do quite a bit

[19:53] <jnthn> Also how few of the bits were done by me :)

[19:53] <FROGGS_> *g*

[19:54] *** kjs_ joined
[19:54] <FROGGS_> jnthn: btw, I did a clone of your OO::*, and have trouble... I'll put my things in a repo tomorrow-ish and then I'd be happy about hints :o)

[19:56] <FROGGS_> I think you might guess what keyword it implements :o)

[19:56] <jnthn> ooh :)

[19:57] <FROGGS_> though, the tricky bit is to export an &EXPORT that sets up the %*LANG hash...

[19:58] <FROGGS_> (and to conditionally export the &EXPORT)

[20:20] * jnthn goes out for some sightseeing :)

[20:20] <jnthn> bbl

[20:22] <FROGGS_> gnight
