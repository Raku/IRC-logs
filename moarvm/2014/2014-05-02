[13:20] <dalek> MoarVM/loop_labels: 0612081 | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/core/exceptions.c:

[13:20] <dalek> MoarVM/loop_labels: make rules for searching for handlers clear

[13:20] <dalek> MoarVM/loop_labels:

[13:20] <dalek> MoarVM/loop_labels: That is, we either need to hit the correct label to continue, or otherwise need to

[13:20] <dalek> MoarVM/loop_labels: have an exception that does not require a label.

[18:55] <nwc10> jnthn: OK, so it seems that Rakudo does not like it if MoarVM was compiled with char being unsigned

[18:55] <nwc10> Stage parse      : Could not locate compile-time value for symbol Whatever

[18:56] <nwc10> verified on x86 and x86_64

[18:56] <nwc10> when the thunderstorm is over, I'll power up the Pi, and see if -fsigned-char there gets us a build

[18:56] <jnthn> Hmmm

[18:56] <nwc10> Yes, mmmm.

[18:56] <nwc10> I don't know how to figure that one out

[18:56] <nwc10> not expecting you to say "do this"

[18:56] <jnthn> I thought we had MVMuint8 and MVMint8 to try and make sure stuff got what it wanted.

[18:57] <nwc10> what I mean is, I'm not sure how to even try to bisect it

[18:57] <jnthn> Maybe check that things are being set up properly in that regard.

[18:57] <nwc10> might be it - treat 'char' as a 4 letter word

[18:57] <nwc10> and remove the expletives :-)

[19:02] <nwc10> ASAN doesn't throw a wobbly, so it won't help

[19:02] <nwc10> is there a way to get gdb to print every file/line as its executed?

[19:03] <nwc10> ie a bit like hammering 's' (for step)

[19:03] <nwc10> because the diff for two execution traces is one way to zoom in on Perl code bugs

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: Add lexical lookup lifetime hinting ops.

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace:

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: Allow us to convey that a given lexical lookup can be relied on to

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: always resolve to the same thing, or can be relied on to resolve to

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: the same thing per invocant type. The former is useful for setting

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: sub lookups, the latter for type variables. For now don't do anything

[22:55] <dalek> MoarVM/spesh_trace: extra, but spesh will be able to improve on this.
