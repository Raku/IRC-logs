[14:23] <brrt> hi #moarvm

[14:25] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[14:25] <brrt> hey jnthn

[14:25] <brrt> i've separated dynasm into its'  own repo

[14:25] <brrt> as you may have seen :-)

[14:26] <jnthn> yeah...I guess maybe we want this as a MoarVM/dynasm repo?

[14:27] <brrt> sure, of course, but now its just a clone :-)

[14:32] <jnthn> brrt: https://github.com/MoarVM/dynasm now exists

[14:33] <jnthn> brrt: and you have permissions to push there

[14:33] <jnthn> or should do anyway

[14:33] <jnthn> also gave you push access to MoarVM repo itself.

[14:33] <brrt> oooh... awesome

[14:33] <jnthn> Usual rules apply: if you're not sure about something, do it in a branch and ask for review. If you're confident, just go ahead.

[14:33] <brrt> i'll guess i'll update my remote urls then

[14:34] <brrt> sure

[14:34] <brrt> i've created a moar-jit branch on my own repo

[14:34] <brrt> but i find keeping it up to date with the 'official' repo is a pain

[14:34] <jnthn> yeah, then feel free to work in the real repo in a branch :)

[14:35] <jnthn> Plus your commits get reported here :)

[14:35] <jnthn> Which is helpful for me to follow what you're doing :)

[14:35] <brrt> sure

[14:35] <brrt> answer - not much yet
