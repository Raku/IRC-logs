[02:23] <timotimo> aha, aha. two instructions directly in sequence grabbing the value from one spesh slot, then the next one and putting them into the very same register

[02:23] <timotimo> without kicking one of the getspeshslot instructions out

[11:25] <FROGGS> ohh nice!

[11:25] <FROGGS> timotimo++

[11:26] <timotimo> doesn't seem to win us terribly much

[11:26] <timotimo> we may want to have a specialization for dynamic variables like $*OUT

[11:26] <timotimo> it seems like we're spending quite some time looking up $*OUT over and over

[11:26] <FROGGS> or $*EXECUTABLE

[11:27] <FROGGS> maybe

[11:27] <FROGGS> I dunno

[12:49] <JimmyZ> timotimo: ping

[13:01] <JimmyZ> hmm, It would be nice to have docs/opitmize.md

[13:21] <timotimo> hey JimmyZ

[13:21] <JimmyZ> hello

[13:22] <timotimo> what kind of stuff would you like to see in that document?

[13:24] <JimmyZ> I think the basic structure, and a bit examples about the idea of optimization like optimize_coerce

[13:24] <timotimo> so it should focus on spesh?

[13:24] <JimmyZ> and how to debug ...

[13:25] <JimmyZ> yeah

[13:27] <JimmyZ> speaking of optimize_coerce, is it trying to change coerce_in to const_n and let the eliminate_dead_ins function remove the pre const_i instruction?

[13:28] <JimmyZ> and before coerce_in, it always is const_i?

[13:30] <timotimo> of course not

[13:30] <timotimo> but there are many cases when a const_i is followed by a coerce_in

[13:30] <timotimo> because our code-gen does that in a not so clever way

[13:31] <timotimo> that's why it looks for "KNOWN_VALUE

[13:31] <timotimo> "

[13:36] <JimmyZ> what's about the first question?

[13:40] <timotimo> ah, yes, the const_i instruction should be removed by remove_:ead_ins

[13:41] <JimmyZ> nice

[13:41] <timotimo> well, hopefully :)

[14:14] * [Coke] wonders if nwc10 is seeing any of the failures coke & lizmat are getting with moar, jit or nonjit.

[15:08] <JimmyZ> timotimo: I thinks it should use MVM_string_utf8_encode_C_string instead of MVM_string_utf8_encode

[15:09] <timotimo> oh? i stole that from a few lines below in that same file %)

[15:12] <JimmyZ> that may be wrongish, since MVM_string_utf8_encode returns non-null-end strings, and call strlen ( in append function ) to the non-null-end strings may ...

[15:21] <FROGGS> what are the colors for?

[15:21] <timotimo> readability

[15:21] <timotimo> making the same register pop out visually

[15:21] <FROGGS> ahh, well, if you say so :o)

[15:21] <FROGGS> ahh

[15:22] <timotimo> it's far from perfect

[15:22] <timotimo> i'd really appreciate feedback

[15:22] <timotimo> i'm not sold on the "greyscale for version number" idea either

[15:23] <JimmyZ> that's nice!

[15:25] <timotimo> https://imgur.com/hFNJ0VV - maybe a bit better

[15:26] <FROGGS> that's better, aye

[15:27] <timotimo> https://imgur.com/KQskiOx - wow.

[15:29] <JimmyZ> wow, but why there is a background color in the right shape :)

[15:30] <timotimo> hm?

[15:30] <timotimo> you mean outside the triangle?

[15:30] <JimmyZ> yeah

[15:31] <timotimo> version of the register

[15:31] <timotimo> follows a greyscale

[15:34] <timotimo> feel free to play around with different "hashing algorithms" :P

[15:38] <JimmyZ> ;)

[15:45] <timotimo> now i want a tool that turns the SSA form into a graphviz graph

[15:57] <JimmyZ> that will be much more awesome with dotted arrow

[15:57] <JimmyZ> ;)

[15:58] <timotimo> dotted ... arrow?

[15:58] <JimmyZ> to guide the next version

[16:00] <timotimo> ah, yes

[16:00] <timotimo> these would go through operators

[16:01] <JimmyZ> something like git lg

[16:01] <JimmyZ> :P

[16:02] <timotimo> i wonder if i can tell graphviz to connect two nodes as "messily" as necessary

[16:03] <JimmyZ> .oO(Perl6::Cario...)

[16:06] <timotimo> doesn't seem to exist
