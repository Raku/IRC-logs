[08:56] <JimmyZ> jnthn: ping

[09:03] <jnthn> JimmyZ: pong

[09:07] <JimmyZ> jnthn: I had a patch, I'm not sure whethr it's useful or not: https://gist.github.com/zhuomingliang/9742792

[09:10] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Does it produce a measurable/profilable improvement?

[09:11] <jnthn> But yeah, in theory it's an improvement.

[09:12] <JimmyZ> jnthn: I think it's an optimization, but I don't know how to measure it

[09:12] <jnthn> Well, it's not going to do a lot, 'cus iirc it only runs in a full collection, not a normal one.

[09:13] <jnthn> And that is configured by default to be 1 in 25 collections.

[09:13] <jnthn> Then gen2 roots also tend to not be terribly long.

[09:14] <jnthn> So it's probably hard to measure.

[09:14] <nwc10> you might be able to measure it with cachegrind.

[09:15] <jnthn> Good point :)

[09:15] <JimmyZ> anyway, I think it is acceptable :P

[09:16] <jnthn> It's not a particular reduction in clarity, so I don't really have a feeling against it.

[09:16] <jnthn> But at the same time, it's hardly optimizing a hot path.

[09:25] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d9db2e32ba

[09:26] <jnthn> Could have said *what* it was a minor optimization of in the commit message... :/

[09:26] <jnthn> Crappy commit messages make it a pain in the arse to assemble the changer log

[09:26] <jnthn> *changelog

[09:26] <jnthn> Mine are typically good enough I just take the commit message as the changelog entry.

[09:28] <JimmyZ> Oh

[09:28] <JimmyZ> I will take care of it next.

[09:28] <jnthn> Thanks.

[16:34] <moritz> does anybody want to debug a MoarVM segfault?

[16:35] <moritz> in the nqp match-prune branch (which I just merged into master) I got segfaults when I pruned too many matches

[16:35] <jnthn> The one JimmyZ's latest patch introduced?

[16:35] <moritz> no, it segfaulted even a week ago

[16:35] <jnthn> If your'e on latest MoarVM it's likely that

[16:35] <jnthn> Oh

[16:35] <jnthn> Well, most likely you've got a null somewhere.

[16:36] <jnthn> And are trying to dereference it.

[16:36] <moritz> aye

[16:36] <moritz> but should that segfault?

[16:36] <jnthn> Not in the long run, but for now that's fatal.

[16:37] <moritz> ok, so nothing really unexpected

[16:38] <jnthn> No. Best best is to see what another backend things of it.

[16:49] <FROGGS> jnthn: is that related to the two bugs I golfed down?

[16:50] <FROGGS> hey, is not_gerd++ back?

[16:50] * jnthn wonders if he'd not be better off rejecting "can't prove an improvement" optimization patches out of hand...

[16:50] <jnthn> FROGGS: No, that is is gerd :)

[16:51] <jnthn> (A gerd who mailed me a patch.)

[16:51] <FROGGS> but that mail address looks familiar :o)

[16:52] <jnthn> Maybe 'cus he did other patches recently to help towards getting Moar distro-friendly? :)

[16:53] <FROGGS> hmmmm, perhaps

[17:01] <jnthn> I'll look at your bug soon, but feeling hungry, so probably I should make me some dinner first :)

[17:01] <FROGGS> food is always choice #1 :o)

[17:01] <FROGGS> I am skimming through RT, perhaps there is something I can fix
