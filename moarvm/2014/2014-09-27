[08:22] <timotimo> hooray! :)

[08:22] <timotimo> masak++ jnthn++ # great minds synergize on a great feature!

[08:52] <masak> it's nice to see this finally "escape" from thinking/discussing into code. ;)

[09:00] <timotimo> :3

[09:08] <masak> ok, I'm gonna force-push origin/esc now.

[09:08] <masak> I suspect no-one cares :) but you have been warned.

[09:09] <dalek> MoarVM/esc: Annotate ops with escape info and store it.

[09:15] <timotimo> what changes does the forcepush give?

[09:16] <timotimo> just putting the esc2 commit on top of the esc branch?

[09:19] <masak> that would not have required a forced push :)

[09:19] <masak> no, I rebased the esc branch first.

[09:19] <masak> on top of master.

[09:56] *** odc joined
[10:19] <timotimo> OK

[10:19] <timotimo> yeah the first commit on esc is already weeks old, isn't it?
