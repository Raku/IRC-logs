[01:26] <JimmyZ> timotimo: I didn't do that, I was reading spesh code to under thing well. Though I found many code needs to be opitmized  :)

[09:17] <brrt> yesterday nights spectest wasn't very pretty (linux, master HEAD)

[09:17] <nwc10> oh? Still works on "my" machine.

[09:18] <nwc10> JimmyZ: "well volunteered" :-)

[09:19] <nwc10> (it would be wonderful if you could figure this stuff out, but please don't feel that you have to)

[09:19] <brrt> maybe i was doing it wrong :-)

[09:19] <nwc10> maybe I am

[09:19] <nwc10> but I'm doing a git clean before the build

[09:20] <brrt> as did i :-)

[09:20] <brrt> i don't have the machine at me at the moment so i can't really check

[13:41] <timotimo> i had a fully clean spectest run yesterday

[13:41] <timotimo> with all masters and freshly reconfigured

[13:41] <timotimo> JimmyZ: can you name examples for things that should be optimized by spesh?

[13:42] <timotimo> JimmyZ: maybe you can try implementing the "boxing/unboxing tracking" thing i've tried to implement once before

[13:42] <timotimo> it blew up in my face sadly; couldn't build nqp (or rakudo?) any more with it

[13:42] <timotimo> but there's multiple occasions where the post-spesh code boxes an int and immediately unboxes it again

[13:42] <timotimo> probably due to in-lined stuff

[13:55] <brrt> timotimo - most likely /me did something wrong like not install fresh nqp before moving to the rakudo spectest

[13:56] <brrt> if everybody else is seeing a clean spectest

[13:56] <brrt> (btw, in the category of 'because you can', i was trying to get rakudo to work on minix :-))

[13:56] <timotimo> haha

[13:56] <timotimo> wow

[13:56] <brrt> but so far had limited success due to virtualbox-minix network driver suckiness

[13:57] <BinGOs> toy OS is toy.

[13:57] <brrt> i used to have success though

[13:57] <brrt> but yeah :-)

[13:57] <brrt> as far as toys go, i think it is kind of cool

[13:58] <BinGOs> they appear to have shot the pooch. It was once possible to build perl5 on minix, but not with the latest version

[13:59] <lizmat> brrt: what kind of filesystem (semantices) does Minix have ?

[13:59] <lizmat> unixlike I would hope?

[13:59] <brrt> pretty much, yes

[14:00] <brrt> they claim netbsd compatibility

[14:00] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[14:01] *** kjs_ joined
[14:01] <BinGOs> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_file_system

[14:02] <BinGOs> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX#MINIX_3

[14:03] <nwc10> how did they manage to break the ability to build Perl? That seems pretty impressive for an OS that is attempting to be Unix-like, considering *how* portable Perl 5 is

[14:03] <brrt> that is really odd

[14:04] <lizmat> .oO( a system on which rakudo builds, but perl 5 doesn't?  what is happening to the world? )

[14:05] <BinGOs> uname -a

[14:05] <BinGOs> Minix 192.168.1.85 3.3.0 Minix 3.3.0 (GENERIC) i386

[14:06] <brrt> lizmat: i haven't actually built rakudo yet :-)

[14:06] <brrt> i said i was going to

[14:06] <lizmat> yeah, I know, I was just dreaming  :-)

[14:07] <BinGOs> I can't find my perl5 build on this vm, so I must have destroyed the old one and haven't got around to trying on this one yet.

[14:07] <BinGOs> I think the conclusion I was coming to was that a hints/minix.sh would be needed.

[14:08] <BinGOs> and the build failure was possibly clang-related. I can't remember.

[14:10] *** rurban joined
[14:13] <brrt> hmmm

[14:13] <brrt> ideally we'd be able to build moarvm without perl5

[14:14] <nwc10> that's about step 5

[14:14] <nwc10> logical pre-reqs are get Rakudo testing and installing without Perl 5

[14:14] <nwc10> then configuring and building without Perl 5

[14:15] <nwc10> (easy enough, NQP is around. Also potentially better, as a Rakudo-based Test::Harness replacement can run in parallel more effectively, and also on Win32)

[14:15] <nwc10> and then do the same with NQP

[14:15] <nwc10> and only then, think about MoarVM

[14:15] <nwc10> none of this is needed to get Perl 6 to 6.0.0

[14:15] <nwc10> or to get performance properly juiced.

[14:17] <BinGOs> you can get a perl5 from the packages.

[14:18] <BinGOs> it reports itself as 'i386-netbsd' in perl -v

[14:26] <JimmyZ> timotimo: maybe I'm wrong, but I think we need more base optimization code like CSE, AA, Constant folding etc to do more work :)

[14:28] <brrt> optimization is hard

[14:28] <JimmyZ> yeah

[14:28] <brrt> let's go shopping :-P

[14:31] <brrt> for my clarity, what is CSE?

[14:31] <brrt> and AA?

[14:31] <JimmyZ> brrt: http://wiki.luajit.org/Optimizations

[14:38] <brrt> that is some impressive list there

[14:39] <JimmyZ> yeah

[14:43] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[14:44] <JimmyZ> looks like CSE is not that hard, except I don't know how to get the CSE entry in spesh

[14:48] <brrt> well....

[14:48] <brrt> ehm

[14:49] <brrt> doesn't SSE form make give you that?

[14:50] <brrt> in the sense that for any 'final' register value, you can determine the graph of how it was computed, and hence you can find out if there are any subexpressions within that graph

[15:05] <BinGOs> brrt: re: minix, I've just had to change it to a manual network configuration instead of the dhcp/nonamed bullshit.

[15:05] <BinGOs> and the network is actually usable

[15:06] <BinGOs> vbox+lance

[15:09] <brrt> aha

[15:09] <brrt> i'm using the detected (emulated) intel pro card and got major crashing

[15:10] <JimmyZ> but looks like it relies on AA, at least in luajit :(

[15:11] <JimmyZ> ah , let's sleep, it's hard

[15:11] <BinGOs> you should have more success with AMD *mumble* *mumble* and the lance driver

[15:12] <BinGOs> but GNU/Hurd feels like a more polished OS than MINIX

[15:15] <JimmyZ> Good night

[15:18] <lizmat> gnight JimmyZ

[15:31] <brrt> BingOS - that is pretty damning for MINIX

[15:31] <brrt> sleep well JimmyZ

[16:00] <BinGOs> oh my.

[16:00] <BinGOs> This is perl 5, version 21, subversion 8 (v5.21.8 (v5.21.7-46-g5e75412)) built for i386-minix

[16:01] <brrt> perl5 works \o/

[16:01] <brrt> via pkgsrc?

[16:02] <BinGOs> that's blead

[16:02] <BinGOs> I've made a very basic hints file to get it working.

[16:03] <BinGOs> for your purposes, you could probably get away with the perl5 from using pkgin

[16:32] <brrt> excellent
