[09:35] <FROGGS> jnthn: I've got an inline bug for you: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/2954182e7f8213a83985

[09:36] <FROGGS> the test is about nested for loops inside a gather take within a sub that is called from within its own for loops

[11:10] <FROGGS> Q: how do I access C globals of a dynamic library?

[11:10] <FROGGS> it looks like dyncall does not help here..

[11:11] <jnthn> afaik, at a low level it's using whatever it's abstraction for dlsym is

[11:11] <jnthn> That should get a pointer to where the global symbol is

[11:12] <FROGGS> nm /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.a | grep xmlParserVersion

[11:12] <FROGGS> 0000000000000b60 T __xmlParserVersion

[11:12] <FROGGS> 0000000000000010 D xmlParserVersion

[11:13] <FROGGS> that's a static lib though

[11:14] <FROGGS> hmmmm, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5460482/dlsyming-a-global-variable-in-c

[11:14] <FROGGS> dlsym seems to be the correct googling term :o)

[11:30] <FROGGS> this:

[11:30] <FROGGS> <FROGGS> jnthn: I've got an inline bug for you: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/2954182e7f8213a83985

[11:30] <FROGGS> <FROGGS> the test is about nested for loops inside a gather take within a sub that is called from within its own for loops

[11:33] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm rather too ill to look at that right now :(

[11:33] <FROGGS> ewww

[11:33] <FROGGS> jnthn: get better soon!

[13:13] <masak> (and for a month or so)

[13:13] <masak> JimmyZ_: heard you moved away... :)

[13:13] <masak> I guess someone warned you about our arrival :P

[13:13] <JimmyZ_> yeah

[13:14] <masak> dangit, we should have come here earlier.

[20:27] <vendethiel> when in perl6-m (REPL), if I type `slurp`, some string, <CR> and then ctrl-D, I get an error

[20:27] <Ven> "write string requires an object with REPR MVMOSHandle"

[20:29] <timotimo> ... huh?

[20:30] <vendethiel> timotimo: am I not clear somewhere?

[20:30] <timotimo> ah

[20:30] <timotimo> you're slurping from stdin

[20:30] <timotimo> and you ctrl-d it

[20:30] <vendethiel> yes.

[20:30] <timotimo> well, it gets closed, then the repl tries to read from it again

[20:30] <timotimo> but it's closed :(

[20:30] <timotimo> but ... i'm confused

[20:30] <timotimo> why "write string"?

[20:30] <vendethiel> you tell me :D

[20:33] <timotimo> well, the error message doesn't come from the wrong op, i.e. it doesn't say "write string" when it's actually trying to read

[20:35] <timotimo> it might get an VMNull instead or something like that
