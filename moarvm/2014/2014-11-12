[19:45] <dalek> MoarVM: reduce fates to 24 bits

[19:45] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/eb499391fa

[19:48] <FROGGS> "The high 40 bits of the fat encodes[...]"

[19:48] <FROGGS> fat?

[19:49] <jnthn> Encodes can become obese too...

[19:50] <japhb> .oO( phat encodes )

[19:59] *** kjs_ joined
[20:14] <TimToady> I sincerely doubt that we need 40 bits for the literal length, but apparently parrot is having difficulty with numbers in the neighborhood of 2^32

[20:14] <TimToady> plus, if we ever try to squeeze these down to 32 bit numbers, it at least leaves use 8 bits for the literal length

[20:14] <TimToady> I doubt we'll see any literals even that long, and we could spec that they max out at 127 or 255

[20:15] <TimToady> *us

[20:20] *** colomon joined
[20:24] <TimToady> only charlists are using pointers, and those could be indices into any array of bitmaps instead

[20:24] <TimToady> which would probably run faster anyway

[20:26] <TimToady> ('course, bitmaps might not work well with NFG)

[20:26] <FROGGS> PNG is superior to bitmaps anyway

[20:27] * FROGGS .oO( don't gif up the puns )

[20:43] <jnthn> .oO( If I weren't behind with work, I could rif off a few more... )

[20:45] <jnthn> .oO( If I don't get this done, there'll be a tiff at best, or somebody psd at worst... )

[20:59] <FROGGS> just png me when that here is over

[21:03] <japhb> Don't mov, I'm sure it'll end soon
