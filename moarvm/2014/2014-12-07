[19:59] <timotimo> jnthn: how do you feel about recording the size of the inter-generational link list after each gc run in the profiler?

[19:59] <jnthn> timotimo: I was thinking of implementing that.

[19:59] <timotimo> in that case, let me steal that from you, so that you can do something harder :)

[20:00] <jnthn> timotimo: :P

[20:00] <jnthn> I think that CORE.setting compilation suffers because it gets really long there

[20:00] <jnthn> Having something recording it would be helpful in seeing if that's the case

[20:19] <timotimo> how do i handle a maybe or maybe not existing key in js?

[20:19] <timotimo> as in gc.gen2_roots // 0

[20:20] <hoelzro> timotimo: roots = 'gen2_roots' in gc ? gc.gen2_roots : 0;

[20:20] <hoelzro> (that's the best I can do)

[20:21] <timotimo> what'll gc.gen2_roots evaluate to if it doesn't exist?

[20:21] <timotimo> and what'll gc['gen2_roots'] evaluate to if it doesn't exist?

[20:22] <hoelzro> null

[20:22] <hoelzro> gc.gen2roots is equivalent to gc['gen2_roots']

[20:22] <timotimo> in that case, wouldn't +gc.gen2_roots work?

[20:24] <leedo_> in Chrome it seems to evaluate to undefined

[20:24] <timotimo> that'd be good enough

[20:25] <leedo_> +undefined evaluates to NaN

[20:25] <timotimo> :\

[20:25] <timotimo> that's not surprising i suppose

[20:26] <jnthn> .oO( NaNNaNNaNNaN WATMAN! )

[20:26] <timotimo> jnthn: i just run the new profiler output over rc-dragon-curve and it seems to be hovering just below 20k gen2_roots

[20:26] <timotimo> anything in particular you'd like me to try?

[20:26] <jnthn> That doesn't sound excruciatingly bad...

[20:27] <timotimo> almost the exact same number for -e 'my @a; for (1 .. 1024_000) { push @a, 1 }; say +@a;'

[20:28] <timotimo> i'll go ahead and push the code, as it seems to work

[20:28] <timotimo> rc-9-billion-names hovers just above 21k

[20:28] <timotimo> or just below 22k actually

[20:30] <dalek> MoarVM: record size of gen2_roots list after each gc

[20:30] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/23f2089ac4

[21:01] <timotimo> now if only there was a way to get an evaluatable profile from the core setting compilation ...

[21:06] <FROGGS> what if we could enable just a few things that get recorded?

[21:10] <timotimo> that'd be possible. perhaps through an environment variable?

[21:11] <FROGGS> probable, yeah

[21:11] <FROGGS> gnight

[21:11] <timotimo> the big thing is the call graph, but not having the call graph removes a crapton of data
