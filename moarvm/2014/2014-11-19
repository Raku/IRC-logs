[09:16] <timotimo> brrt: when you're finished with the static moarvm binary thing, that'd be a great topic for a blog post, eh? :)

[09:16] <brrt> yes

[09:16] <brrt> :-)

[09:16] <brrt> i thought i'd be finished by now

[16:04] <FROGGS> timotimo: can you try to write better commit titles? it is not easy for me to put "we get "set a, b; set b, a" rather often" in a changelog

[16:09] <timotimo> oh

[16:09] <timotimo> i'll try to do so in the future

[16:09] <timotimo> those commits were just about eliminating some common cases of having way too many "set" instructions

[16:11] <FROGGS> okay, I add it as "remove a bunch of unnecessary set operations"

[16:11] <FROGGS> s/operations/instructions/

[16:13] <timotimo> yeah, "set operations" sounds more like (elem) or (&) or so :)

[16:13] <FROGGS> true :o)

[16:15] <timotimo> i still want somebody to fix up a "prune the call graph" piece to the profiler ...

[16:16] <timotimo> sorting by "exclusive time" frequently crashes the tab that the profiler data is loaded in ...

[16:31] <FROGGS> @all: please check: ChangeLog for 2014.11 release - https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3a73b11c9ad06feb19ce5e9220acd5f332a4d95b

[16:33] <timotimo> if you mention the tool to color registers in spesh logs, why not also mention the graphviz tool that can turn spesh log output into pretty data-flow and control-flow graphs?

[16:34] <FROGGS> ohh, yes, these were two distinct things /o\

[16:34] <FROGGS> feel free to add it... I have to prepare $food now

[16:35] <timotimo> OK :)
