[10:05] <moritz> http://blog.httrack.com/blog/2014/03/09/what-are-your-gcc-flags/ should we compile with -fvisibility=internal ?

[10:14] <FROGGS> ohh, now I want to add all these flags! :/

[10:16] <timotimo> hmm, how about -march=native :)

[10:18] <moritz> where do you want do march? :-)

[10:20] <timotimo> (except for releases, where we should not do -march=native)

[10:30] <timotimo> binary releases i mean

[13:05] <FROGGS> this seems serious, and breaks building nqp-m suse packages

[13:06] <jnthn> FROGGS: How did you connect that to the segfault, ooc?

[13:07] <FROGGS> guessing wildly :o)

[13:07] <jnthn> You reproduced the segfault?

[13:07] <FROGGS> no

[13:08] <FROGGS> it just seems to segfault when it should write to a file for the first time...

[13:09] <jnthn> It segfaults on first invocation

[13:11] <FROGGS> hmmm, maybe I should set up a openSUSE_13.1-x86_64 ?

[13:13] <FROGGS> damn, an SSD does not only has benefits :/

[13:13] <FROGGS> have*

[20:20] <jnthn> FROGGS: OK, great

[20:48] <FROGGS> moarvm+nqp HEAD and also 2014.02 builds fine :/

[20:50] <jnthn> oh. Hm.

[20:51] <jnthn> Did the log include what configuration was used? Not thinking it's likely to be an issue though...

[20:51] <FROGGS> jnthn: yes

[20:51] <jnthn> Didn't use some --optimize=3 or so?

[20:51] <FROGGS> I am going to reply it as closely as possible, perhaps installing to /usr breaks it

[20:51] <jnthn> ok

[20:51] <FROGGS> no, no flags at all IIRC

[20:52] <jnthn> k

[21:00] <FROGGS> it still builds fine, with the same flags as daxim++ used

[21:01] <jnthn> Hmm

[21:02] <jnthn> That makes it altogether harder to figure out.

[21:02] <jnthn> FROGGS++ # trying it out

[21:04] <FROGGS> maybe he can provide his packaging script (and the needed packaging foo, because I have no clue)

[21:50] <FROGGS> line 61 can go I think

[22:09] <lue> .oO(wouldn't it be mostly mindless stubbing then?)

[22:11] <jnthn> let's hope so ;)

[22:14] <jnthn> No :)

[22:30] <jnthn> Time to rest up for tomorrow's teaching :)

[22:30] <jnthn> 'night o/

[22:38] <hoelzro> I've talked to my fiancee about a MVM logo

[22:38] <hoelzro> ideas for what it should look like are in short supply, though =/

[22:41] <TimToady> MVM is so, like, 1995...

[22:42] <hoelzro> I was thinking a Camelia that looks like she's going really fast =)

[22:42] <lee__> MVM looks like an ascii butterfly :P

[22:42] <hoelzro> I was not blessed with artisitic creatively, I'm afraid

[22:42] <hoelzro> lee__: you might be on to something there...

[22:43] <lee__> V could be antennae, i guess

[22:44] <TimToady> A Unicode butterfly would be maor butter, er, better.

[23:02] <tadzik> jnthn: hm, odd

[23:02] <tadzik> oh, I know why

[23:03] <tadzik> I should probably nullify it first

[23:04] <tadzik> jnthn: can you see if that'll help?

[23:11] <timotimo> the notability requirements of moarvm will only be met once we have "outside sources" talk about MoarVM some

[23:13] <tadzik> hm?

[23:17] <timotimo> that's quite violent :(

[23:18] <tadzik> it is :/ I should've made the blood green

[23:18] <timotimo> yeah. otherwise you couldn't sell it in germany

[23:18] <tadzik> yep

[23:19] <tadzik> I think I'll spare you the german german version of the above though :)
