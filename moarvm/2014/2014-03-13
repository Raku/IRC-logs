[09:59] <jnthn> hmm, a tcg todo is "- Add float and vector support." :)

[10:00] <nwc10> tcg? A JITting type thing?

[10:00] <jnthn> The float support is quite a missing thing :)

[10:00] <jnthn> nwc10: Yeah.

[10:00] <jnthn> nwc10: Got some interest from somebody to work on it in GSoC, so pondering options a little :)

[10:07] <brrt> here's the interest :-)

[10:08] <brrt> although i've learned that i only have a week! left to apply

[10:08] <brrt> :-o

[10:09] *** woolfy left
[10:20] <jnthn> :-O

[10:20] <jnthn> Well, we can make that.

[10:20] <jnthn> I'm willing to mentor. :)

[10:22] <brrt> fortunately so :-)

[10:22] <brrt> i hope to have some time for it this weekend

[10:24] <brrt> many things to be planned, worked out

[10:25] <nwc10> I thought that the real "skill" in proposal writing is to figure out a description which sounds good, is actually viable, but is sufficiently flexible it doesn't commit to any kind of hard pass/fail deliverable

[10:26] <nwc10> ie, as long as the student works reasonably hard and diligently, something will be delivered which is useful

[10:27] <brrt> …. i have slightly higher hopes than 'something' personally

[10:27] <brrt> :-)

[10:28] <brrt> but not really the brain space left to think too deep about it

[10:31] <jnthn> So long as you have moar brain space in the summer :P

[10:32] * brrt is finally going to look up the word 'moar'

[10:32] <brrt> ah i see

[10:33] <jnthn> Stands for Metamodel On A Runtime :)

[10:33] <jnthn> Sicne the VM came out of taking 6model and sticking a runtime around it :)

[10:33] <brrt> that i knew

[10:34] <timotimo> is there something that must be done on moarvm to flush stdout when we're breaking off execution with a stack trace?

[10:34] <timotimo> or is that something for nqp?

[10:45] <brrt> … one of my ideas for now is that you might need / want to represent a JIT-ed call frame / stack somewhat different from a non-jitted one

[10:46] <brrt> and that you might want to use a REPR for that so that the gc can trace it

[10:46] <brrt> .. probably call frames are already REPRS

[10:51] <timotimo> MVMStaticFrame is a repr at least

[10:54] <timotimo> well, and there's MVMCode, which seems to be something different, but is contained in MVMStaticFrame as a pointer

[10:55] <brrt> uhuh

[10:55] <brrt> i'll need to check that out, haven't really got time for that

[10:55] <brrt> but thanks for the pointer :-)

[10:55] <timotimo> i didn't invest much time in the analysis either >.<

[10:57] * brrt off for lunch

[11:24] <jnthn> We should keep JITted ones the same at first.

[11:24] <jnthn> 'cus it makes your deopt a lot simpler.

[11:44] <JimmyZ> jnthn: how hard to add float support?

[11:47] <timotimo> probably depends on the number of supported backends? :\

[12:04] *** brrt joined
[12:12] * brrt back from lunch

[12:29] <jnthn> JimmyZ: No clue. :)

[12:29] <jnthn> JimmyZ: But my question is, "if that's missing what else is"

[12:30] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Not to mentin that it has the extra abstraction layer problem, which I think might help us at first, but hinder us in the long run.

[12:30] *** lizmat joined
[12:32] <JimmyZ> jnthn: agreed, I like the dynasm one if the generator is written by perl 6, but by lua :P

[12:33] <JimmyZ> btw

[12:33] <JimmyZ> not serious

[12:34] <jnthn> It's not a runtime dependency, though

[12:34] <jnthn> It's not even a buidl dependency

[12:34] <JimmyZ> yeah

[12:34] <jnthn> In so far as we can check in the .c file

[12:34] <JimmyZ> just developer needs it :P

[12:34] <jnthn> So then it's only a tiny dependency for anybody who is going to hack on the JIT :)

[12:34] <jnthn> A full Lua is 200KB or so :)

[12:35] <JimmyZ> yeah, to me, dynasm is much easy than tcg

[12:36] <JimmyZ> because it has less abstraction

[14:51] <brrt> not that it is super-important, but lightning doesn't seem that hard, even if a bit RISC-y

[15:27] *** colomon joined
[15:51] <jnthn> brrt: lightning gives us licensing issues though :(

[15:51] <brrt> oh

[15:51] <brrt> i see

[15:52] <brrt> fair enough

[15:52] <brrt> actually, no, that is not fair though

[15:52] <brrt> one free software project not being able to use another free software project because of licensing is just madness

[15:53] <brrt> we're working together, people!

[15:53] <jnthn> Apart from when we aren't.

[15:53] <jnthn> If you're Stallman, LLVM is a "huge setback".

[15:54] <jnthn> 'cus it's not GPL'd.

[15:54] <jnthn> If your interest is in "enforcing freedom" then the GPL makes sense.

[15:54] <brrt> …. i'm sorry but i had to laugh about that

[15:54] <jnthn> I'm more in this because I like making nice things and sharing them. :)

[15:54] <brrt> 'i thought i could organise freedom'

[15:54] <brrt> didn't know stallman was scandinavian

[15:54] <jnthn> So my concerns/motivations for doing open soruce are entirely different.

[15:55] <brrt> well, yeah, i guess mine too

[15:55] <japhb__> jnthn: That would presumably be why you call it 'open source' instead of 'free software'.  :-/

[15:55] <jnthn> japhb__: Right.

[15:56] <japhb__> (That :-/ was about the war of words, not you, of course.)

[15:56] <jnthn> japhb__: Well, I know I choose licenses that folks who want to own the meaning of "free software" would get upset about, so it's easier to just say "open source" :)

[15:57] <japhb__> nodnod.  I sometimes end up just using 'FOSS' as a "Look, I don't plan to grind your axe either way.  That's irrelevant to the current discussion."

[15:58] <jnthn> *nod*

[15:59] <brrt> it is hardly ever relevant

[16:00] <brrt> but anyway

[16:00] <brrt> :-)

[16:02] <japhb__> brrt: Yep.  But some otherwise good to work with people will get their hackles up if you "wear the other gang's colors"

[16:03] <brrt> people and their tribes

[16:03] <japhb__> I wonder how many metaphors I can mix there.

[16:03] <brrt> some people will get angry when i telll them i have - gasp - perl5 programs

[16:03] <brrt> can't make everybody happy :-)

[16:03] <jnthn> THEY'RE SCRIPTS!! :P

[16:03] <jnthn> ;)

[16:03] <japhb__> LOL

[16:04] * japhb__ has a plan to make everyone happy -- which involves nitrous oxide

[16:09] <jnthn> Well, it's getting towards dinner time here... :)
