[07:27] <jnthn> timotimo: Which benchmark is it?

[07:28] <jnthn> Having a lot of static frames in the nursery sounds very odd, yes

[07:28] <jnthn> Is that on first collection, though?

[07:28] <jnthn> Or a later one?

[07:29] <FROGGS> morning

[07:30] <FROGGS> jnthn: we really need to do something about 32bit machines :o) - http://testers.perl6.org/dist/NativeCall

[07:30] <FROGGS> (where 'we' really is you *and* me hopefully)

[07:31] <jnthn> cpan - da testers! :D

[07:32] <FROGGS> cpan date sters!

[07:32] <FROGGS> :P

[07:32] <FROGGS> the page even would be fast if I'd precompute more things

[07:35] <jnthn> And yeah, agree...

[07:36] <FROGGS> but... IIRC the NSA will be involved here?

[07:36] <jnthn> No, I don't think it needs to be

[07:36] <FROGGS> cool

[07:37] <FROGGS> I guess it is just a tiny change that'd make x86 work...

[07:37] <FROGGS> but I already tried and failed twice :o)

[07:38] <jnthn> OK. I need to go to do some urgent but boring paperwork at the office...I'll have some tuits later in the day, and can take a look.

[07:39] <FROGGS> ahh, no hurry

[07:39] <FROGGS> just wanted to do some conversation :D

[07:39] *** JimmyZ joined
[07:40] <jnthn> .oO( ♬ A little less conversation, a little moar action please ♬ )

[07:40] <FROGGS> hehe

[07:41] <jnthn> hah, that's the same song that uses the word "satisfactioning" :)

[07:42] <jnthn> NSA is something I plan to dig into soon, though. Hopefully starting this week. :)

[07:42] <jnthn> commute &

[08:00] <nwc10> jnthn: NSA before NFG?

[08:11] <TimToady> there's some chance NSA will be useful to NFG, and no chance of the reverse

[08:11] <FROGGS> *g*

[08:12] <FROGGS> TimToady: I always imagine you speaking these sentences with a slow dark voice coming from the off :o)

[08:12] <FROGGS> (except when I don't)

[10:37] <timotimo> jnthn: that's the "for native postinc"

[10:37] <timotimo> and that was in one of the later collections

[11:34] <jnthn> timotimo: hm, wtf...

[11:35] <timotimo> yes, my thoughts exactly :)

[11:38] *** daxim joined
[11:46] <FROGGS> jnthn: before I forget: there is something to review in case you are in the right mood this week: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/sepsh

[11:47] <FROGGS> jnthn: I don't consider it mergeable btw

[11:47] <FROGGS> I just wanna talk about it to get insights

[12:06] *** JimmyZ joined

[12:26] <timotimo> hmm. perhaps the fact that the code got OSR'd is somehow related to the massive build-up of MVMStaticFrames?

[12:26] <brrt> \o

[12:26] <timotimo> perhaps a frame that results from OSRing doesn't get cached? instead it gets recreated each time the osrpoint gets hit?

[12:27] <brrt> that'd be a bug

[12:27] <timotimo> yeah

[12:27] <timotimo> just a theory i made up

[12:28] <timotimo> i don't actually know how the OSR mechanism is implemented exactly

[12:28] <brrt> basicaylly, by sp ops iirc

[12:28] <brrt> which are compiled into labels, iirc

[12:28] <timotimo> well... that's pretty much a no-explanation :P

[12:28] <JimmyZ> I know how it triggers

[12:33] <brrt> i'm sorry timotimo :-)

[12:35] <timotimo> brrt: how about that blog post? :3

[12:35] <brrt> :-$

[12:35] <timotimo> i hope you've been all right

[12:35] <brrt> yes... just incredibly busy and barely finished my last trimester

[12:35] <timotimo> OK

[12:36] <brrt> :-)

[12:36] <timotimo> you want me to mention anything you'd like to do this week?

[12:36] <brrt> (motivation to study is diminishing, though)

[12:36] <timotimo> in the weekly post, i mean

[12:36] <brrt> no, not yet :-)

[12:36] <timotimo> aaw

[12:36] <brrt> there will be enough weeklies
