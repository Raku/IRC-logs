[09:13] <brrt> hi #moarvm, just wanted to report that i finally handed in my proposal

[09:14] <JimmyZ> Hello, I can't see it

[09:14] <moritz> brrt++

[09:15] <moritz> brrt: please join #soc-help on irc.perl.org

[09:15] * JimmyZ hopes there is a gist version

[09:16] * brrt will post a gist version sure :-)

[09:16] <brrt> ok will do moritz

[09:16] <brrt> maybe after i restart X though, brb

[09:19] *** brrt joined
[09:22] <brrt> https://gist.github.com/bdw/9682548 -> html version in a gist

[09:22] <brrt> should've used markdown? yeah, probably

[09:31] *** jnap joined
[09:33] <JimmyZ> sounds good

[09:40] <brrt> thanks :-)

[09:40] <brrt> perl foundation wishes me to actually fix a bug

[09:40] <brrt> so i'm off to the issues tracker

[09:43] <brrt> is this fixed by now? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/66 - because i see Configure.pl emitting 'updating submodules' when i run it

[09:44] <moritz> brrt: no, it's not fixed yet

[09:45] <moritz> the submodules are only about updating the source code

[09:45] <moritz> brrt: the problem here is that once the stuff in 3rdparty/ is built, you have to type 'make realclean' to rebuild it

[09:46] <moritz> brrt: because the MoarVM makefile has no deps between the 3rdparty sources and the 3rdparty object files

[09:46] <brrt> ok, seems doable

[09:46] * brrt takes a look

[09:47] <brrt> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/62 this one seems fun, too

[09:48] *** woosley left
[09:49] <JimmyZ> \o/, fix all of them!

[09:50] <JimmyZ> yeah, the gc one seems more fun

[09:51] <brrt> i know

[10:42] <jnthn> .tell brrt On your proposal, the bytecode graph building part will be done by the time you get there, I think. Possibly some of the type stuff too.

[10:42] <jnthn> hmm, no message bot?

[10:42] <FROGGS> gone :/

[10:42] <jnthn> .tell brrt I think your intermediate set will want some things that can't exist in regular MoarVM bytecode too - unsafe things that we prove the correctness off.

[10:43] <jnthn> ok, I guess somebody can point him at backlog if he doesn't see it himself :)

[10:43] <FROGGS> I'll try to :o)

[10:45] <nwc10> jnthn: unsafe things that we *can't* prove the correctness of?

[10:45] <jnthn> uh

[10:45] <nwc10> well, a static verifier can't prove the correctness of, so mustn't be in loaded bytecode, which can't be trusted completely

[10:45] <jnthn> unsafe things we can prove the correctness of.

[10:46] <nwc10> oh, I see

[10:46] <jnthn> Well, there's multiple levels of this

[10:46] <jnthn> The verifier proves a bunch of static properties

[10:46] <nwc10> potentially unsafe things that we can prove the correctness of at generation time, but can't do at load time

[10:46] <jnthn> But if you're JITting something with guards, then you can rely on more stuff in protected code-paths.

[10:46] <jnthn> Like, you can dig straight into an object and drag out an attribute, once you know its type.

[10:47] <jnthn> brrt: "Notably in the django world were everything is always broken" => harsh... ;) and s/were/where/ :)

[10:49] <jnthn> brrt: By the way, will you be at Dutch Perl Workshop?

[11:18] *** brrt joined
[11:19] <brrt> jnthn - seen backlog, seems ok

[11:23] <brrt> when is the dutch perl workshop?

[11:27] <brrt> 24th of april

[11:27] <brrt> ... would be nice, but i'm not sure what kind of study obligations i'll have

[11:27] <nwc10> oh, a Thursday

[11:27] <nwc10> you could attend the beer^Wfluxx and whisky track

[11:30] <brrt> 25th of april, sorry :-)

[11:30] <brrt> yes, maybe in the afternoon

[11:30] <nwc10> oh, a Friday. That makes more sense. :-)

[11:31] <nwc10> you are free on Saturday? This is probably important

[11:31] <brrt> :-) yes, i'm free on saturday

[11:31] <nwc10> I have not been to the Dutch Perl Workshop, but I understand that everyone stays up very late.

[11:31] <nwc10> or at least, quite a few people choose to

[13:56] <brrt> jnthn, are you there?

[13:57] <brrt> i was challenged by pmurias on thinking up a list of opcodes that could be JIT-ed

[13:57] <brrt> and i'm thinking - only a pretty small set, really

[15:38] <tadzik> Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler -- does that sound like a moarvm thing?

[15:39] <tadzik> hm, on jvm it's a different exception

[15:40] <tadzik> heh, most curious :)

[15:41] <tadzik> it happens when C calls Perl 6 which calls a method with not enough arguments given

[15:57] <FROGGS> tadzik: MoarVM/src/core/frame.c:552:                MVM_panic(1, "Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler");
