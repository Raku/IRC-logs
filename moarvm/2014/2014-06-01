[10:24] <masak> timotimo's 1a224d30 can't be cleanly reverted on Moar HEAD.

[10:24] <masak> oh, but the conflict resolution is trivial.

[10:28] <masak> trying to build a Rakudo on top of a Moar with 1a224d30 reverted.

[10:35] <masak> yep, bug goes away with 1a224d30 reverted.

[10:35] <masak> suggest reverting 1a224d30 as a short-term fix.

[10:40] <lizmat> masak: but you said it can't be cleanly reverted ?

[10:40] <lizmat> also: fwiw, I'd rather move forward fixing the pb

[10:41] <lizmat> I mean, does this really affect anything apart from constructed evidence yet?

[10:52] <masak> lizmat: the non-clean revert turned out to be a very trivial conflict.

[10:52] <lizmat> ah, oik

[10:53] <masak> lizmat: I'd also rather we move forward fixing the problem -- but as a general rule I prefer we keep master working as much as possible.

[10:53] <masak> maybe keep the commit in a branch until the problem has been resolved?

[10:55] <lizmat> fine by me  :-)

[11:00] <masak> ok, nice.

[11:00] <masak> however, I don't feel involved enough in Moar to just go ahead and revert that one in master.

[11:00] <masak> I'll let others weigh in.

[11:04] <lizmat> same for me, actually

[12:27] <dalek> MoarVM: temporarily get rid of optimize_can_op, as it can break stuff
