[16:20] <FROGGS> it has a width

[16:24] <FROGGS> that might give us about 50 passing tests

[20:33] <[Coke]> 90 more passing tests today.

[20:35] <FROGGS> still working on some

[20:35] <timotimo> sounds great!

[20:36] <timotimo> at about 150 more passing tests we'll reach 99% of jvm

[21:05] <[Coke]> ssh down on host06?

[21:16] <jnthn> FROGGS++ # S05 looking a lot better in spectest run I just did

[21:16] <FROGGS> jnthn: I am not done yet :o)

[21:16] <FROGGS> found a thing I can fix

[21:18] <jnthn> Yeah, I see fails in properties-derived.t and named-chars.rakudo.moar still

[21:18] <jnthn> 39 and 46 fails respectively

[21:26] <diakopter> [Coke]: not sure

[21:26] <diakopter> I can access it from host07

[21:34] <diakopter> THE CLOUD IS DOWNd

[21:36] <jnthn> I...think we call that rain?

[21:36] <FROGGS> that is called fog then, no?

[21:36] <FROGGS> :P

[21:36] <jnthn> oh, or that... :P

[22:00] <timotimo> do we know yet what's causing the rest of the test case failures? like in S03-operators/arith.t? (i could probably check out those), or in the pre-post, enter-leave, rvalue phasers tests?

[22:01] <FROGGS> at least I don't know what is wrong there

[22:01] <timotimo> some s06-signature failures are new; might that be the signature binder that's partially lowered? maybe some corner cases (or, looking at "errors.t", probably error cases) haven't been considered yet?

[22:01] <jnthn> I know about those S06 new ones.

[22:02] <jnthn> Or at least, the cause of a bunch of them.

[22:02] <timotimo> good to know

[22:02] <timotimo> anything you want me to perhaps check out?

[22:02] <jnthn> The S03 ones I don't know what's the root cause of.

[22:02] <timotimo> haven't looked at what tests exactly fail

[22:02] <jnthn> Nor the S04 ones really

[22:03] <jnthn> I know a few S29 ones we've left are about German :P

[22:03] <timotimo> heh :)

[22:03] * timotimo builds newest rakudos

[23:02] <timotimo> it would appear negative modulus with rats is b0rked

[23:08] <timotimo> but the result isn't simply a not rounding in the right direction error
