[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM: 5239796 | (Rob Hoelz)++ | src/io/fileops.c:

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM: Clear fd when closing a file handle to prevent "dangling" descriptors

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM: We can run into a situation with MoarVM where a double close can

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM: close an arbitrary, innocent file.  Consider:

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:   my $fh := nqp::open($filename); # let's say it's FD 3

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:   # do stuff

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:   nqp::close($fh);

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:   my $other_fh := nqp::open($other_filename); # 3 again!

[08:44] <dalek> MoarVM:   nqp::close($fh); # closes 3! o_O

[09:56] <FROGGS> hoelzro: we faul about 100 moar rakudo tests with https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/998bacca7b3d3abab644 :o(

[09:58] <FROGGS> I'd need sanity tests for it to continue hacking though

[09:58] <FROGGS> I hope I have time for that this afternoon

[10:01] <FROGGS> this does not fail on HEAD, but with the patch: S10-packages/basic.rakudo.moar aborted 59 test(s)

[10:03] <timotimo> what's the error message, ooc?

[10:05] <FROGGS> here is the diff from HEAD to patch: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/360ed9125e2ce1890bc7/revisions

[10:05] <FROGGS> -S10-packages/use-with-class.t...................... 9 0 0 0 9

[10:05] <FROGGS> +S10-packages/use-with-class.t......................===SORRY!===

[10:05] <FROGGS> +Could not find t::spec::packages::UseTest in any of: /home/froggs/dev/MoarVM/../nqp/install/languages/perl6/site/lib, /home/froggs/dev/MoarVM/../nqp/install/languages/perl6/vendor/lib, /home/froggs/dev/MoarVM/../nqp/install/languages/perl6/lib, /home/froggs/.perl6/2013.12-317-g29a51f0/lib

[10:05] <FROGGS> ahh, wait

[10:05] <FROGGS> I think it does not know about -Ilib

[10:06] <FROGGS> or -I. or so

[10:06] <timotimo> strange.

[10:07] <timotimo> there's also a "wrong version of QRegex" in the middle of all that

[10:07] <timotimo> which i'm pretty sure is spurious

[10:07] <FROGGS> ohh, that is about my v5

[10:08] <FROGGS> k, another run, we'll see

[11:18] <FROGGS> S10-packages/basic.rakudo.moar.....................===SORRY!===

[11:18] <FROGGS> Missing or wrong version of dependency 'src/gen/m-CORE.setting'

[11:18] <FROGGS> gah!

[11:18] <FROGGS> I did twice a make clean and a rebuild and it did not help

[11:18] <FROGGS> I'll leave that for now

[11:18] <tadzik> :o

[11:19] <FROGGS> tadzik: I just wanted to create a summery report :/
