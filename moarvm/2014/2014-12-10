[22:50] <brrt> \o

[22:51] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[22:51] <brrt> i have flappynqp  tests (fail under prove, run directly) on windows with master nqp and master moarvm

[22:52] <jnthn> On windows? Not seen that, ever.

[22:53] <brrt> hmm

[22:53] <brrt> well, neither have i, but there it is

[22:54] <jnthn> Oddness. I'm wrkin gon an advent post and then I should rest because I slept awfully last night.

[22:54] <jnthn> But will look tomorrow to see if I can recreate it.

[22:55] <TimToady> if it were just random memory differences, you wouldn't get the skew toward failing under prove, but there does seem to be such a skew, which is maybe a big fat clue, if only we were Sherlock Holmes

[22:56] <brrt> http://install.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/yum/itecs/public/bumblebee

[22:57] <brrt> random memory differences?

[22:57] <TimToady> a larger or small env, or argv, for instance

[22:57] <TimToady> anything that moves allocations onto or off of boundaries

[22:58] <TimToady> but I'm sayin' it doesn't seem to be random, or sometimes it would work under prove and not directly

[22:58] <TimToady> but that seems to rarely be the case

[23:00] <brrt> hmmm

[23:00] <brrt> it is the case here though

[23:00] <brrt> i don't get it at all

[23:00] <TimToady> you said it fails under prove, which is the normal case

[23:01] <brrt> could it have something todo with the expired windows license the vm is running on? some features disabled?

[23:01] <brrt> it does not fail when running directly

[23:01] <TimToady> some kind of ulimit thing?

[23:03] <brrt> possible

[23:03] <brrt> but to be honest i have no idea

[23:07] <TimToady> I guess there's options to prove one could play with

[23:07] <TimToady> to show failure output and such
