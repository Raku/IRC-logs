[09:10] <brrt> \o

[09:10] <brrt> let me backlog and see if anybody else saw big jit failures

[09:10] <brrt> wait a minute

[09:10] <brrt> hmmm

[09:10] <brrt> [Coke] - what kind of make do you have?

[09:11] <brrt> and more importantly, is it possible that your dynasm-compiled file may be out of sync

[09:11] <brrt> because that would certainly explain why the failures that you report tend to be out of sync with the repository :-)

[09:11] <brrt> and it would be a fixable error

[09:26] *** kjs_ joined
[10:38] <timotimo> that would certainly be an interesting slash horrifying kind of bug

[10:41] <brrt> hmm

[13:00] <[Coke]> I use the xcode-supplied tools.

[13:01] <[Coke]> GNU Make 3.81

[13:01] <[Coke]> This program built for i386-apple-darwin11.3.0

[13:01] <timotimo> 3.81 is quite recent

[13:02] <[Coke]> also, I do a fresh build every day, clean checkouts.

[13:02] <timotimo> OK, so if it didn't do the .dasc to .c thing, it'd explode altogether

[13:02] <[Coke]> I am doing parallel build wherever possible, though. (not currently possible to build moar that way, no passthrough make options)

[13:03] <[Coke]> just started today's run, will let you know what happens. This is the second time I've had big failures with no reproducability elsewhere.

[13:03] <timotimo> that's pretty bad

[13:03] <timotimo> thank you once again for your continued test runs

[13:04] <timotimo> it's hard to express how helpful they have been; even though sometimes people seem to not care about test failures for a couple of days ;(

[13:04] <[Coke]> heh.

[13:05] <[Coke]> when I have time, I don't mind also fudging (and even occasionally fixing) things. hard to rememer everyone is at least as time crunched as I am. :)

[13:05] <[Coke]> thanks to everyone for all the hard work!

[13:24] <brrt> we try :-)

[13:25] <[Coke]> looks like at least one of moar's segfaults from yesterday is gone.

[13:26] <[Coke]> so, flapping segfaults, maybe? blah.

[13:30] <brrt> ah.. that's nasty

[13:30] <brrt> how much memory do you have? could potentially be a gc issue with JIT

[13:32] <timotimo> huh? but we use MVM_malloc everwhere that ought to do error checking, no?

[13:49] <brrt> i say potentially

[13:49] <brrt> :-)

[13:49] <brrt> i can be wrong

[13:49] <brrt> very wrong

[16:54] <[Coke]> brrt: this machine has 16G

[16:54] <[Coke]> so that's probably not it.

[22:57] <dalek> MoarVM: 69f322c | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/io/syncpipe.c:

[22:57] <dalek> MoarVM: fetch exit code of a closed pipe on windows

[22:57] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/69f322c071

[23:14] <timotimo> can we get something like a supply that emits whenever a Proc::Async that's open for writing is "ready to read from stdin"?

[23:16] *** kjs_ joined
[23:22] <timotimo> hm. it seems like wanting to detect when a subprocess is waiting for input on stdin requires the use of a pty :\

[23:25] <timotimo> i will have to do something "smarter" in that case.
