[02:26] <tecia> Hi folks, I wanna learn and contribute to MoarVM. Where should I start? Any suggestions?

[02:28] <JimmyZ> hello

[02:28] <tecia> Hi :)

[02:28] <xiaomiao> tecia: check out the code, build it, figure out how things are glued together

[02:29] <JimmyZ> tecia: http://moarvm.org/roadmap.html here is the roadmap

[02:29] <xiaomiao> maybe look at bugreports and try to figure out how things break, and then maybe fix them?

[02:29] <TimToady> you probably also need to get a little bit familiar with nqp and Perl 6, since that's what it's primarily designed to support

[02:30] <JimmyZ> xiaomiao 是北京的？

[02:31] <TimToady> jnthn and brrt are both asleep right now though, but our east Asian folks are awake now :)

[02:31] <xiaomiao> JimmyZ: bu shi

[02:31] <xiaomiao> JimmyZ: I'm in Shanghai, but ain't chinese, so please don't expect me to parse hansi

[02:32] <JimmyZ> oh

[02:33] <TimToady> otoh, I can understand that one

[02:33] <xiaomiao> I recognized beijing :)

[02:33] <JimmyZ> your name looks like chinese :P

[02:35] <xiaomiao> JimmyZ: almost. should be xiaomao if it were proper pinyin, but I prefer the alliterative sound of the current misspelling

[02:35] * TimToady must wander off, alas...

[02:35] <tecia> Thanks for all reply replies

[14:35] <jnthn> I hope people aren't lying in commit messages :P

[14:37] <JimmyZ> :P

[14:37] <jnthn> Darn it. gcc was warning free last time I did a build under it.

[14:38] <jnthn> Now it ain't.

[14:38] <jnthn> Doesn't block relesae, but will have to take a look

[14:38] <jnthn> I know clang is clangy, but gcc we should be able to keep clean :)

[14:39] <nwc10> maybe you need "cage cleaners"

[14:39] <JimmyZ> Is it about nfa.c?

[16:40] <[Coke]> oooh, can i find a typo now!? ;)

[16:42] <lizmat> please do  :-)

[18:50] <japhb> jnthn: Are you interested in a list of "top wishlist items that need jnthn's help"?  Or are your next several weeks already pretty well planned out?

[21:15] <jnthn> japhb: I need to spend a week or so relaxing and recovering from the last month and a half's crazy.

[21:16] <jnthn> japhb: At that point I'll have some idea of how deep my exhaustion/burnout is.

[21:17] <jnthn> But when I have decent quantities of energy again, I already have a pretty big Perl 6 and MoarVM related todo list to start trucking through.

[22:46] <japhb> jnthn: Fair enough.  Enjoy your week of R&R.  :-)
