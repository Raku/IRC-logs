[10:00] <timotimo> while laying in bed i thought we may want to expose the common inlined callsites to extops, too

[10:03] <timotimo> p6routinereturn uses invoke, for example, and passes a "custom" non-inlined callsite

[10:04] <timotimo> and p6finddispatcher also invokes under certain circumstances

[12:26] <dalek> MoarVM: jit randscale_n through a little helper function

[12:26] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/075401753f

[13:40] <timotimo> low-ish hanging fruit: implement isnanorinf as well as cmp_n for the jit

[13:40] <timotimo> please-k-thanks :)

[13:40] <timotimo> as well as invokewithcapture, which i'm hoping brrt will get around to building

[13:52] <JimmyZ> and as well as cmp_i ?

[15:23] <timotimo> we don't have cmp_i yet?

[15:23] <timotimo> in that case, go ahead :)

[15:23] <JimmyZ> sleep firstly here :)

[15:24] <JimmyZ> 23:23 here

[15:24] <timotimo> OK, good night :)

[15:26] <JimmyZ> good night

[15:42] <timotimo> jnthn: does it seem like an acceptable idea to merge BBs if they strictly follow each other and all that breaks them up is an unconditional goto and they each have only one successor/predeccessor between them?

[15:42] <timotimo> intra-BB-optimizations seem a bit easier than inter-BB-optimizations

[16:32] * timotimo is trying to get the name of lexicals to show up in the speshlog, too

[16:33] <timotimo> jnthn: is this the right idea? i have to take the SpeshGraph's sf, follow the ->outer->body as often as the lexical's "outers" value and then use the "idx" to index the literal_names_list array and get the entry's ->key and print that out, no?

[16:34] <jnthn> Sounds approximately correct, yes

[16:34] <timotimo> OK, then i'll just have to figure this segfault out :)

[16:36] <timotimo> pff. --optimize=g and still all locals got optimized out

[16:38] <timotimo> the 7th lexical name list entry is a null pointer; does that mean i have to demand the deserialization fo that frame to be completed?

[16:40] <jnthn> Potentially yes

[16:41] <timotimo> um ... the num_lexicals is 2, the index is 7

[16:42] <timotimo> this is with outers being 0

[16:42] <timotimo> so i'm directly accessing the g->sf->body->lexical_names_list

[16:45] <jnthn> Umm...latest MoarVM master won't build for me... :(

[16:45] <jnthn> callsite.c

[16:45] <jnthn> src\core\callsite.c(41) : error C2375: 'MVM_callsite_get_common' : redefinition; different linkage c:\consulting\moarvm\src\core/callsite.h(104) : see declaration of 'MVM_callsite_get_common'

[16:45] <timotimo> oh

[16:45] <timotimo> i must have forgotten to commit tthat?

[16:45] <timotimo> no, i did commit that

[16:45] <timotimo> i put MVM_PUBLIC in front of that in the header and the source

[16:46] <timotimo> perhaps i off-by-one'd the right function?

[16:46] <jnthn> You didn't put it in the header.

[16:46] <timotimo> fixed

[16:46] <timotimo> i *did* off-by-one the right function

[16:47] <timotimo> oh, dalek has gone to take a nap?

[16:52] <jnthn> Seems happier.

[16:55] <FROGGS> timotimo: feather2 has a downtime, and I guess that's where dalek runs

[16:57] <timotimo> jnthn: now i just check for the index being in range and print a little note when it happens

[16:58] <timotimo> happens only a single time in the program i just tested

[16:58] <timotimo> looks good now i think

[17:02] <timotimo> and committed
