[15:18] <FROGGS_> moritz: aye, but sadly not yet in master

[15:18] <moritz> FROGGS_: yes, needs a release for that, I guess

[15:19] <FROGGS_> right, and I dunno when that will happen, if at all... see https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/pull/27

[15:19] <FROGGS_> there was no release for two years now

[15:21] <lizmat> couldn't we make moar dependent on a clone of the repo ?

[15:27] <FROGGS_> lizmat: we do already

[15:27] <lizmat> ah....   couldn't you then pull that in the cloned repo ?

[15:28] <FROGGS_> lizmat: but you (packagers) can pass --has-tommath or so, and that will use the system's tommath

[15:28] <FROGGS_> it is in our clone
