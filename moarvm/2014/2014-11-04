[14:01] <brrt> hmmm

[14:01] <brrt> should we build a uwsgi-moar

[14:01] <brrt> and what would that take

[14:06] <brrt> the lua plugin was apparantly developed in 4 short hours

[15:00] <JimmyZ> brrt: why we needs cgi? isn't something like jetty better?

[15:01] <timotimo> the wave of the future is having applications that just speak HTTP

[15:01] <timotimo> HTTP over TCP; communicating with a web server that handles the "tricky stuff" for you

[15:06] <brrt> not cgi, uwsgi :-

[15:06] <brrt> uwsgi :-)

[15:06] <brrt> uwsgi is very very very easy to use

[15:06] <brrt> and very useful

[15:10] <timotimo> what's it good for again?

[15:12] <JimmyZ> I can't see why uwsgi is better than something like jetty

[15:12] <timotimo> i don't know what jetty is either %)

[15:12] <JimmyZ> :P

[15:12] <JimmyZ> timotimo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetty_%28web_server%29

[15:15] <brrt> i'm not into comparative web server thingies

[15:15] <brrt> thing is, uwsgi deals with a log of the uglies of http

[15:15] <brrt> and with threading and prefork systems and clusters and all sorts of niceties

[15:16] <brrt> and at $dayjob i noticed that it is pretty complete and awesome, and that they happily take on other projects

[15:16] <brrt> so i'm saying, why not

[15:20] <JimmyZ> Worth to try :P

[15:25] <brrt> basically, it is a production-ready web serving solution

[15:28] <JimmyZ> I just don't know which is better :P , *gi vs Servlet

[15:40] <brrt> neither do i, and it could well be that it is context-dependent
