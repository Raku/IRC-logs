[13:52] <jnthn> Earlier today, the machine hosting moarvm.org was victim of an attack that drew it into a botnet, and so was promptly taken offline. Typical that it happens while I'm on vacation. On the upside, it happened on an afternoon that was rainy and miserable enough that I was indoors anyway :)

[13:53] <nwc10> this is also why your IRC client went away?

[13:53] <jnthn> Yup.

[13:53] <nwc10> suck.

[13:53] <jnthn> Anyway, that + moarvm.org are now running off a nice new thingy.

[13:54] <nwc10> excellent

[13:54] <jnthn> Modulo DNS migration.

[13:54] <nwc10> with a pony?

[13:54] <jnthn> (Didn't actually have to change name servers, just records.)

[13:56] <brrt> wow man, that sucks

[13:59] * jnthn just remembered there's a moarvm.com too, and re-poined that :)

[13:59] <jnthn> uh, pointed

[14:04] <jnthn> Other thing is that I'd had a "re-do all this infrastructure" plan figured out and waiting on free time.

[14:05] <jnthn> Guess part of it happens early...

[14:06] <moritz> jnthn: in the long run, IWBN if you weren't the only one who can upload moarvm releases

[14:06] <moritz> jnthn: bus factor and all that

[14:07] <jnthn> moritz: Yeah...crossing the road here in .my is a little hair-raising...

[14:08] <jnthn> ;)

[14:08] <jnthn> but yeah, I'll set something up "in the long run"

[14:08] <jnthn> (Hopefully not so long.)

[14:09] <nwc10> jnthn: I thought it was bad enough in Salzburg when the trolleybus swooshed by

[14:09] <nwc10> (just when I was thinking of crossing the road, and hadn't looked)

[14:09] <moritz> has anybody tried the new github releases thingy?

[14:09] <moritz> (not so new anymore, I guess...)

[14:11] <[Coke]> TROLL BUS

[15:46] <timotimo> moritz: you mean the thing that constantly sends users our way with tarballs that don't work? :)

[16:01] *** lizmat joined
[16:04] <moritz> timotimo: no, that's downloading tarballs for a tag

[16:04] <moritz> timotimo: releases are also tied to a tag, but allow uploading of other binaries, iirc

[16:06] <timotimo> oh

[16:06] <timotimo> that wouldn't be too bad

[16:44] <[Coke]> lots of moar failures on today's run, differences between jit and not

[16:46] * timotimo updates his 8 months old local checkout of roast-data

[17:37] <hoelzro> is there any possiblity of reverting that lazy deserialization stuff?

[17:37] <hoelzro> at least until it's determined what the problem is and it can be fixed?

[18:24] *** brrt joined
[18:25] <timotimo> it's probably possible

[18:27] <timotimo> it might be easier to just put a "'lazily' deserialize everything right at the beginning" in, though

[18:27] <brrt> :-o [Coke] that's worrisome

[18:28] <hoelzro> timotimo: I, in my Moar ignorance, tried that, and made it segfault =/

[18:28] <hoelzro> but someone moar experienced with the inner workings of Moar (and in particular serialization) may have better luck with that

[18:28] <timotimo> oh, huh

[20:36] <timotimo> brrt: ISTR you said something about potentially building a set-removal kind of thing based upon PHI?

[20:36] <timotimo> that was quite some time ago, though

[20:36] <brrt> let me think

[20:38] <timotimo> that might really be worth something

[20:39] <timotimo> especially if it just relies on what the phi ops do already

[20:39] <timotimo> like, after a set, two registers are "merged", kind of like what a PHI signifies

[20:40] <timotimo> but i'm not sure if spesh can already handle PHI that are not at the beginning of a BB

[20:40] <brrt> phi's are always at the beginning of a bb :-)

[20:42] <timotimo> at the moment, sure

[20:42] <timotimo> but if we replace set instructions with phis, they may no longer be.

[20:43] <timotimo> except if we just add more sources to the phi ops that belong to blocks we jump to from the block we're doing the set-removal in at that moment

[20:51] <brrt> okay, the truth of it is, i don't know if we can do that yet :-) that problem seems hairier to me now than it did then

[20:51] <brrt> but that may just be an indication of my head being a bit removed from it

[20:57] <timotimo> OK

[20:57] <timotimo> hey

[20:57] <timotimo> so now that we can enter jitted code easily on moarvm

[20:57] <timotimo> ...

[20:57] <timotimo> Inline::ASM? :D

[20:59] <timotimo> especially with NSA that could be cool

[21:00] <lizmat> ah, the days I could just hex code into a buffer and have it execute by just doing "asmcall" on it

[21:00] <timotimo> :D

[21:04] <[Coke]> I remember the days when I'd key in a dozen pages of hex code from a magazine to get a crappy C64 game.

[21:04] <timotimo> :D
