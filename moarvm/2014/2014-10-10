[06:23] <timotimo> good catch o nthe s = "" thing; but i'm not sure we'd been running into that case a lot so far?

[11:10] <brrt> timotimo: no

[11:10] <brrt> it's a long story

[11:10] <brrt> but getobjsc is ultimately a pretty simple op if you trace it down to its roots

[11:12] <brrt> what i intend to do is ignore the assert statements

[11:12] <brrt> which simplifies things considerably

[13:09] <timotimo> hm. have i asked about this already? how difficult will it be to jit nativecallinvoke properly?

[13:10] <timotimo> are we likely to have a KNOWN_VALUE for the thing that we want to invoke?

[13:13] *** brrt joined
[14:06] <jnthn> timotimo: It's somewhat tricky to do really well

[14:13] <timotimo> that's not surprising :)

[14:15] <jnthn> We may also want to revisit the API if we find it's too JIT hostile. :)

[14:30] <JimmyZ> jnthn: I had a question for you .... : http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2014-10-10#i_9484107

[14:33] <jnthn> JimmyZ: It seems that ended up being done elsewhere

[14:33] <jnthn> (further donw in the ifle)

[14:33] <jnthn> So that probably can go

[14:33] <JimmyZ> OK, thanks

[20:10] <brrt> ok, MVM_USE_OVERFLOW_SERIALIZATION_INDEX is never defined for x64 because MVM_PTR_SIZE must be 8

[20:38] <dalek> MoarVM/jit-getobjsc: This causes two spectest failures

[20:39] <brrt> a little present for APW :-)

[20:39] <lizmat> brrt: fwiw, S17-procasync is a flapper

[20:39] <brrt> oh

[20:39] <brrt> it worked this morning so i assumed it to be fixed

[20:40] <brrt> anyway, rather safe than sorry

[20:40] <brrt> and branches are cheap

[20:40] <lizmat> yup  :-)

[20:43] <brrt> i'll be weekending now. have fun :-)
