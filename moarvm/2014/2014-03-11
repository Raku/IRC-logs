[07:48] <masak> timotimo: ah; pity.

[07:48] <timotimo> aye

[07:48] <timotimo> well, it's perhaps gdb's fault

[07:48] <masak> probably need to configure STDOUT as binmode utf8 or something.

[07:48] <timotimo> i don't think python actually lets you do that :|

[07:49] * jnthn decrees that tadzik's drawing of "mindless stubbing" will NOT be the MoarVM logo :P

[07:51] <masak> url? :)

[07:51] <jnthn> backlog

[07:51] * masak found it

[07:51] <masak> :)

[07:52] <masak> tadzik: st*u*bbing!

[07:52] <timotimo> i really like lue's idea with MVM drawn as a butterfly

[07:52] <timotimo> it would work surprisingly well, i bet

[07:52] * masak closes that tab, because the mindlessly stubbing guy keeps smiling eerily at him

[07:53] <masak> timotimo: ooh, ooh! a stylized butterfly!

[07:53] <masak> timotimo: clearly related to Camelia, but pixellated or something.

[07:53] <masak> hm, that sounds lame, but I bet I could make that look pretty good.

[07:54] <timotimo> i'd prefer soft lines to pixelation

[07:54] <timotimo> i think i'd have to draw a little something.

[07:55] * timotimo cleans whiteboard with lots of alcohol

[07:55] * jnthn had a dream last night that the oven in his kitchen was replaced by a small nuclear reactor...

[07:55] <jnthn> Not quite sure how to interpret that one :)

[07:57] <masak> jnthn: didn't a guy in our province try to do nuclear experiments at home?

[07:57] <masak> something like a year or so back?

[07:57] <masak> the police came and confiscated his stuff.

[08:01] <jnthn> oh noes, my oven...or reactor!

[08:02] <jnthn> But yes, I remember that :)

[08:03] <JimmyZ> good morning you all

[08:20] <jnthn> Will have some moar tuits this evening, though :)

[08:35] <JimmyZ> ssh is slow... when you'are typing

[08:36] <timotimo> well, use vi in ex mode and have local line editing :)))

[10:16] <FROGGS> I've not backlogged yet

[10:17] <FROGGS> not bad

[10:17] <FROGGS> this could look indeed pretty cool

[10:18] <timotimo> now we only need someone with skill to actually do it.

[10:53] <masak> timotimo: looks like a snail with lobsted claws :)

[10:53] <brrt> it may look evil

[10:53] <masak> moarrrrrr

[10:54] <timotimo> i kinda like that interpretation, too

[10:54] <timotimo> not everything regarding Perl 6 has to have a butterfly on it

[10:54] <masak> YES IT DOES

[10:55] <masak> :P

[11:06] <masak> srsly though, I guess it's jnthn's choice how tightly we should tie Moar's logo to Perl 6.

[11:06] <timotimo> well, practically MoarVM should be able to run many things well that can be made to work on the 6model

[11:06] <timotimo> in a way, it *could* end up as the new parrot some time after it has become stabilised etc

[11:07] <timotimo> to me, 6model seems both simple and powerful; and thus elegant

[11:09] <FROGGS> masak: you propose we just use a pix of jnthn? :P

[11:09] <FROGGS> pic*

[11:12] <timotimo> jnthn's beard is very, very roughly MVM shaped

[11:12] <timotimo> maybe just M. or maybe just V.

[11:13] <FROGGS> somehow I like a lower case m with the dots of ö

[11:13] <FROGGS> err, in »m«

[11:13] <FROGGS> (I am to lazy to put the dots on top atm)

[11:14] <FROGGS> but yeah, I'd like the logo to be more aggressive somehow

[11:18] <timotimo> masak: i just remembered: there must be a hack to get unicode output'd to the gdb log, because that's how i do the gen2 block diagrams.

[11:18] <_sri> http://i.imgur.com/FjmWO85.png # :p

[11:18] <tadzik> :)

[11:18] <_sri> i'll see myself out http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m37l96vFp71qb978l.gif

[11:20] <timotimo> :)

[11:21] <timotimo> i'm actually liking the crab idea more and more.

[11:27] * _sri would pick a rocket, or something else that implies speed

[11:29] *** jnap joined
[11:32] <jnthn> timotimo: Mostly just M I think :P

[11:32] <jnthn> We're not using my beard as the logo :P

[11:33] <timotimo> grab yourself some scissors and make it more MVM shaped then :)

[11:38] <timotimo> jnthn: so, is a crab as the moarvm mascot acceptable to you?

[11:41] <FROGGS> a holy crab?

[12:22] <masak> _sri: I always liked that butterfly. _sri++

[12:22] <masak> the typeface is nice, too.

[12:23] <masak> is there a logotype that would convey the sense of "more", somehow?

[12:33] <FROGGS> masak: a full glass of beer?

[12:45] <FROGGS> hmmm

[12:46] <FROGGS> a seedling would kinda fit too... but how would an aggressive seedling look like?

[13:08] <[Coke]> like a mad ent?

[15:42] <brrt> hey.. ehm.. who could i talk to about adding JIT to moarvm

[15:42] <brrt> i have many questions

[15:43] <JimmyZ> jnthn++, of course

[15:44] <JimmyZ> or just ask here :P

[16:05] <jnthn> decommute now, though &

[16:17] <[Coke]> brrt: are you volunteering to work on/design it, or just asking it be done?

[16:18] <brrt> work / design

[16:19] <brrt> :-)

[16:19] * brrt wants fun stuff to do

[16:28] <brrt> also - GSoC, could use money, education expensive, etc :-D

[16:28] <brrt> imho GSoC is an ideal way to spend a summer

[16:32] <jnthn> I think we're probably a month or so off the point where it's sensible to work on a JIT, but GSoC doesn't start for a couple of months... :)

[16:33] <jnthn> Basically the plan is to get the stuff in place for the bytecode specialization (which can also be helped on) and then JIT from the same data structure, since it'll be in SSA form already.

[16:36] <jnthn> .oO( he didn't like that answer? :) )

[16:37] <TimToady> or he left JIT

[21:45] <jnthn> yeah

[21:45] <jnthn> Well, that's what we have the NQP_REVISION/MOAR_REVISION mechanism to handle...

[21:46] <jnthn> It'll just be a missing include directory though.

[21:46] <nwc10> dyncall.h does not appear to be installed

[21:46] <nwc10> it's in MoarVM/3rdparty/dyncall/dyncall/dyncall.h

[21:46] <nwc10> I guess that NQP is happy because it's also in nqp/3rdparty/dyncall/dyncall/dyncall.h

[21:47] <nwc10> I need to go to sleep, so can't help dig further

[21:49] <jnthn> Well, NQP doens't try to compile any C code.
