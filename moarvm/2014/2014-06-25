[06:55] <brrt> \o #moarvm

[06:55] <brrt> i was planning to get at deopt today

[06:56] <brrt> i just wonder

[06:56] <brrt> how to test it

[07:10] *** lizmat joined
[07:24] *** woolfy joined
[08:21] <timotimo> throw a role onto something? :)

[08:28] *** brrt joined
[08:43] <brrt> hmm

[08:43] <brrt> i might

[08:49] <timotimo> i hope that actually does it

[08:50] <moritz> the question is: what's optimized that might need a deopt?

[08:50] <timotimo> anything that does an invocation will give a deopt point and i think we just deopt a whole bunch as soon as we see such a change

[08:54] <jnthn> Well, that'll be a deopt_all if you mix in

[08:55] <jnthn> A deoptone is less usual, though we hit a bunch of them when building NQP

[08:55] <jnthn> One way is to have an attribute that contains something of a certain type, look it up in some code you call again and again so it ends up guarding against it, maybe call a method on the thing you looked up to make sure the guard gets used for something.

[08:55] <jnthn> And then change the attribute to somehting of a different type and do another invocation.

[08:56] <jnthn> Thing is, I don't think the JIT does attribute lookup stuff yet...which get turned into the various p6oget ops. And only an object attribute is interesting.

[08:56] <jnthn> Return values from things we call are also guarded.

[08:56] <jnthn> But I don't know the JIT does invocation yet

[08:57] <jnthn> getlex of an object may do it

[08:57] <jnthn> so not sure anything that uses guard clauses yet will JIT compile due to it also using another NYI thing.

[09:18] <brrt> JIT doesn't do invocation, no

[09:18] <brrt> not yet

[09:19] <brrt> hmmkay

[09:22] <jnthn> yeah, so may be some other things to do first

[09:22] * jnthn suggests attribute binding and looking with the sp_p6o* ops

[09:23] <brrt> yes, i agree

[09:23] <brrt> also bindlex / getlex

[09:23] <brrt> oh i have a question about that, or rather had, and am now trying to renember what it was

[09:25] <jnthn> ok

[09:25] <jnthn> lunch, but bbiab

[09:27] * brrt is going to have lunch in a bi too

[10:19] <nwc10> jnthn: ./perl6-m t/spec/S17-promise/allof.t goes SEGV on ASAN with *and without* spesh

[10:20] <jnthn> I'd tend to expect concurrency related failures to be fairly independent of that

[10:20] <nwc10> not really in a positionto dig further

[10:20] <jnthn> They're hard to debug, though, and I've not had undistracted chunks of time to look yet.

[10:21] <jnthn> May have some time tomorrow. But in practice...I'm kinda ill :(

[10:21] <jnthn> And 10 hours of sleep last night didn't fix it.

[10:54] <brrt> did you know that register offsets in x86 memory access may be 32 bits wide?

[11:01] <brrt> i'm opening yet another page to understand the redirection involved in sp_p6oget_o :-)

[11:32] <jnthn> nwc10: Oh wow, that is interesting place to explode...

[11:34] <jnthn> nwc10: Do you have the ASAN output describing the problem handy?

[11:34] <jnthn> I'm wondering if it's some kind of freelist corruption...

[11:34] <jnthn> (e.g. the fle->next)

[12:02] *** brrt joined
[12:03] <brrt> hmm... so at least sp_p6oget_o compiles

[12:03] <brrt> oh, isn't correct yet

[12:04] <timotimo> do we have a good plan yet to make rakudo itself more inline-friendly?

[12:04] <timotimo> i seem to recall it's about having handlers everywhere

[12:04] <timotimo> i think at one point we said "handlers are ridiculously cheap on moarvm"

[12:04] <timotimo> if that was the case back then, now it's different :)

[12:05] *** colomon joined
[12:06] <brrt> why aren't handlers cheap?

[12:07] <timotimo> because (iiuc) they prevent inlining from happening

[12:07] <brrt> i have not enough rakudo-knowledge to consider that

[12:07] <brrt> ooh...

[12:07] <brrt> hmmmm

[12:08] <timotimo> ISTR it's about every sub having a handler for "return"

[12:08] <timotimo> though i think there's a method somewhere called "is_clearly_returnless"

[12:08] <timotimo> maybe in that case we could just not emit the handler? i don't know.

[12:08] <jnthn> timotimo: It's not horribly difficult to merge handler tables for inlining.

[12:08] <jnthn> timotimo: It's just some work that I didn't get around to yet.

[12:08] <timotimo> oh!

[12:08] <timotimo> well, fair enough :)

[12:09] <jnthn> Same with extops.

[12:09] <jnthn> The inline branch was "make the basic inlining and deopt work", not "do everything imaginable" :)

[12:09] <timotimo> fair enough

[12:09] *** jnap joined
[12:09] <jnthn> Better to merge branches early provided they don't actually regress stuff knowingly, and get the feedback :

[12:10] <timotimo> what's your plan with extops, btw? is there some way to have multiple "tables" of extops so we can just use the tables from other SC's or so?

[12:10] <jnthn> Also, I'm so getting a repair person out for this laptop...to fix my  key.

[12:10] <timotimo> or do we have to merge them and change the numbers for the extops to match up again?

[12:10] <jnthn> ) key...how ironic.

[12:10] <timotimo> temporarily map printscrn to ) or something? :)

[12:10] <jnthn> Not sure quite how I'll do it yet...

[12:16] <brrt> (between 3 and 5 levels of indirection for the 'fast path' of sp_p6oget_o. o.O)

[12:17] <timotimo> and those indirections are all going to stay in the jitted version?

[12:17] <brrt> yes

[12:17] <timotimo> well, it'd appear that'd be necessary

[12:17] <brrt> hmmm

[12:17] <brrt> some of these may change

[12:18] <jnthn> 5? :)

[12:18] <brrt> yes

[12:18] <brrt> let me see if i count that right

[12:18] <brrt> in the good case, we'd be able to reduce that to 2

[12:19] <brrt> i think

[12:19] <brrt> but in the bad case, the data of the object has been replaced with something, and is then null and should be replaced with vmnull

[12:19] <brrt> that is where that comes from

[12:20] <jnthn> yeah, 5 if you hit all the slow paths

[12:20] <jnthn> I think just JIT the whole thing, though

[12:20] * brrt can count the mov instructions

[12:20] <jnthn> :)

[12:28] <brrt> what is the difference between sp_p6ogetvt_o and sp_p6ogetvc_o and sp_p6ogetvc_o

[12:30] <timotimo> are the last two actually different at all?

[12:45] <timotimo> please don't bbq the evening

[12:51] <brrt> the weather that is

[13:13] <jnthn> vt = vivify with type object, vc = vivify with concrete object (and thus clone it)

[13:42] <jnthn> Note that vt often shows up in NQP code where has $!x will be NQPMu by default, and vc in Rakudo where $!foo will be a Scalar by default and thus we need a distinct Scalar.

[14:46] <brrt> what does the 'owner' field in the MVMObject header represent?

[14:46] <brrt> better question

[14:47] <timotimo> which thread it belongs to?

[14:47] <timotimo> hm, not actually sure

[14:52] <brrt> think 7452384 is a reasonable value for it?

[14:52] <brrt> is 0 a reasonable value for st?

[14:54] <brrt> i don't suppose it really is, is it?

[14:55] <timotimo> stables should be set, shouldn't they?

[14:56] <brrt> well, i have something that really should be an object, and has a zero st

[15:00] * brrt is unhappy

[15:19] *** vendethiel joined
[15:26] <brrt> the fact that integer division without octoword conversion causes an exception is really useful for debugging

[15:43] <jnthn> brother: owner should probably be 1 always in a single-threaded program. And st should certainly not be NULL.

[19:40] <timotimo> got  something  to  report? 😊

[19:41] * jnthn back

[19:43] <jnthn> brrt: Question? :)

[19:44] <brrt> oh, ehm....... yes, i had a question, but i'm not sure what

[19:44] <brrt> (that only happens always)

[19:45] <brrt> ok, have you (perchance) seen that i've added support for sp_p6obind_*

[19:45] <brrt> i'm wondering what to do tomorrow

[19:46] <brrt> i can continue adding ops fine, but which?

[19:47] <brrt> i also want to start cleaning stuff up / moving it about

[19:47] <brrt> i.e graph creation to jit/graph.c or something, compilation to jit/compile.c

[19:51] <jnthn> Well, the funky sp_p6oget_ object ones that vivify would complete that "set"

[19:52] <jnthn> Generally, though, one idea could be to start logging which unavailable ops cause JIT bailout.

[19:52] <jnthn> And then hack a script that ranks them.

[19:52] <brrt> oh, i know that already

[19:52] <jnthn> And that'll tell you what the top blockers are.

[19:53] <brrt> i don't have that, no :-)

[19:53] <brrt> thats a good idea

[19:53] <brrt> i think wval is a big blocker

[19:54] <jnthn> Yeah

[19:54] <brrt> ok, script to read jit log, thats a good idea

[19:54] <jnthn> In the best case, the wval is in gen2 and you can just directly use the memory address of it

[19:54] <jnthn> In the less good case you'll need to do the lookup

[19:55] <jnthn> In fact, I'd factor that out

[19:55] <brrt> hmmm, make it a call?

[19:55] <brrt> (c function call)

[19:55] <jnthn> Works for me

[19:55] *** lizmat joined
[19:55] <brrt> yes, i suppose for me too :-)

[19:55] <jnthn> If you do, move the wval impl in interp.c to use that func too

[19:56] <jnthn> There's also wval_wide or so

[19:56] <jnthn> Which I guess won't JIT any different really

[19:56] <jnthn> Just for bytecode space efficiency

[19:56] <brrt> where should i put the 'wval function' anyway?

[19:56] <jnthn> sc.c

[19:56] <brrt> oh, yes

[19:57] <jnthn> I think that you may want a general thing in the JIT like

[19:57] <jnthn> try_emit_gen2_ref(...)

[19:57] <brrt> hmmm

[19:57] <jnthn> That checks if the object you pass it is in gen2, and if it is JITs a direct static access

[19:57] <jnthn> And returns true

[19:57] <jnthn> And if not, returns false

[19:58] <jnthn> Then wval, and sp_getspeshslot, and const_s, and getcode, and probably some things things can all use it

[19:58] <brrt> i see what you mean

[19:58] <jnthn> Of course, the slow path for them is different, but may as well factor out the fast path :)

[19:58] <jnthn> Which will occur very often.

[19:58] * brrt agreed

[20:04] <jnthn> Of course, the really big thing to attack still - or one of at least - is invocation.

[20:04] <jnthn> And with it, JITted code retruning to JITted code, and non-JITted returning to JITted, etc.

[20:05] <jnthn> If you'd rather spend this week hammering out a bunch more of the basic ops, that's fine by me.

[20:05] <jnthn> But I don't think we should put invocation off too much further (as in, could be good to be digging into it next week)

[20:07] <brrt> i agree as well

[20:09] *** LLamaRider joined
[20:17] <jnthn> Some of the basic objecty ones could be good also
