[15:23] <TimToady> You sure that's an insect?  Looks kinda like a camel...

[15:26] <FROGGS> it was supposed to be a worm :o)

[15:45] <TimToady> looks the larval form of something

[16:30] <masak> I always thought that if you name your VM "Moar", you've condemned yourself to one day having someone look at it, think "this is way too bloated!" and forking off a "LessVM".

[16:30] <masak> :P

[16:32] <jnthn> I look forward to seeing the improvements. :)

[16:34] * masak .oO( it will have less features )

[16:34] <masak> I love how we apparently do cross-channel punning today.

[16:34] <masak> the archeologists from the future are going to have trouble untangling these.

[16:35] * masak waves to the future

[19:02] <timotimo> WormVM?

[19:06] <moritz> and then there are those who use vim as their pager, and create a fork named VimVM

[19:10] <timotimo> perl6 is hardly worse than vimscript

[19:35] <tadzik> argh, dat lag. ww
