[14:50] * [Coke] wonders how long he's not been in channel.

[14:55] <nwc10> [Coke]: at least 13 days

[14:55] <[Coke]> I dislike IRC. :P

[14:55] <[Coke]> nwc10++

[14:56] <jnthn> [Coke]: Don't worry, we didn't do much here :P

[14:56] <nwc10> and the logs will prove that

[15:03] <moritz> "you know I've got the scars^Wlogs to prove it"

[15:04] <[Coke]> PerlJam: I see no reason why moarvm isn't a valid Hague target. (see also Diakopter's grant request)

[15:09] *** colomon joined
[15:48] *** benabik joined
[16:15] <masak> yes -- why wouldn't moarvm be a valid Hague target?

[16:50] *** FROGGS joined
[16:51] <PerlJam> I think I was wondering out loud to see if nwc10 would apply  :)

[16:52] <nwc10> PerlJam: I (will) have a full time job. Money doesn't create more time

[16:52] <FROGGS> yeah, sadly

[16:54] <PerlJam> Yeah, bummer.

[17:09] <[Coke]> The existing of diakopter's grant might interfere with other granting, also. (depending on what kind of work we're talkign about)

[17:12] *** eternaleye joined
[17:13] <PerlJam> speaking of diakopter's grant ... where does it show up on TPF's site?

[17:14] *** camelia joined
[17:16] <[Coke]> http://news.perlfoundation.org/2013/09/hague-grant-application-accept.html http://news.perlfoundation.org/2013/07/hague-grant-application.html

[17:24] <PerlJam> Why doesn't it show up on http://www.perlfoundation.org/running_grants ?

[17:25] <[Coke]> same reason the macro grant doesn't?

[17:25] <[Coke]> (will ping Karne0

[17:25] <[Coke]> er, Karen)

[17:27] <PerlJam> I never seem to know how to interact with perlfoundation.org to find out useful stuff.   I don't know if that's just my personal problem or if there's something that perlfoundation.org could do better.

[17:28] <[Coke]> Step one: if you can't find something, ping someone with TPF and ask them about it, so they can try to fix it.

[17:28] <[Coke]> (check.)

[17:29] <nwc10> that page seems only to have grants comittee related grants

[17:29] <nwc10> a technicality that shouldn't matter to people outside of TPF

[17:29] <nwc10> so it doesn't have active P5CMF grants either
