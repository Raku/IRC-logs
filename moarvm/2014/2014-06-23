[06:56] <timotimo> o/

[06:56] <timotimo> what's on the menu for today? :)

[06:58] *** zakharyas joined
[07:03] <brrt> today.... i'm going to fix the inline-jitting bug

[07:03] <brrt> :-)

[07:05] <timotimo> sounds good

[07:05] <timotimo> the last 4 days i haven't paid close attention because of the GPN going on

[07:06] <brrt> the last days i have taken a bit of a 'vacation' :-)

[07:06] <brrt> so there wasn't much to pay attention too

[07:07] *** lizmat joined
[07:07] <brrt> i have added support for the notion of 'do something useful with the return value of this function' though, don't know if you've seen that

[07:09] <timotimo> i saw the word "return" be used in commit messages, so i assumed, but i didn't know for sure

[07:16] <nebuchadnezzar> 'morning

[07:17] <brrt> morning

[07:17] <timotimo> hi chad :)

[07:18] <brrt> it means the set of opcodes that can be implemented greatly increases :-)

[07:20] <nebuchadnezzar> can someone provides me a “tree” or “ls -lR” of a MoarVM installation on windows? I'm trying to address issues #102 #103

[07:20] *** FROGGS joined
[07:20] <brrt> i... saw your request yesterday, and i think jnthn is perhaps the main windows-user here? i don't have windows installed right now

[07:20] *** woolfy joined
[07:21] * timotimo can not :(

[07:21] <timotimo> froggs may have a VM maybe?

[07:21] <timotimo> no, wait, doesn't froggs develop on windows and has linux vms?

[07:22] <FROGGS> it is the other way around :o)

[07:22] <FROGGS> I develop on linux, and have a bunch of VMs for testing

[07:22] * brrt still has to make a vm of his hdd

[07:22] <timotimo> OK

[07:24] <brrt> fwiw, i recall working with php and not of my coworkers ever having installed php on their windows

[07:24] <FROGGS> but it is damn easy :o)

[07:24] <timotimo> i was a php person once; it started during my windows days; i had a WAMPP :/

[07:24] <brrt> it is very easy indeed

[07:24] <brrt> they didn't do it

[07:25] <brrt> professional programmers, no less

[07:25] <timotimo> does that mean they never locally tested their stuff?

[07:25] * FROGGS builds rakudo latest on windows

[07:25] <brrt> we had a shared debian installation accessible via ssh or ... whatsitcalled

[07:25] <timotimo> telnet? :P

[07:25] <timotimo> FTP perhaps? :D

[07:25] <brrt> the-windows-filesharing-thingy

[07:26] <FROGGS> hehe

[07:26] <brrt> no

[07:26] <timotimo> SMZ

[07:26] <brrt> samba :-)

[07:26] <timotimo> SMB*

[07:26] <timotimo> samba is the free implementation

[07:26] <timotimo> ("first word in the dictionary that contains S, M and B in that order")

[07:26] <brrt> anyway, that was enough, they just worked on that machine via SMB file share

[07:26] <brrt> (and moaned without end about it being slow)

[07:27] <timotimo> fair enough; php programs may need some extra setup and you'd have to make extra sure your php.ini is the same as on the remote machine, as well as the apache config

[07:27] <brrt> the more reason to learn how to do that, no?

[07:27] <xiaomiao> well, php

[07:27] <xiaomiao> more effective to push needles under your fingernails ;)

[07:27] <timotimo> i mildly disagree; it can be easy to be developing against a slightly incorrect php/apache/DB setup and mess up *everything*

[07:27] <brrt> more hilariously, the machine was also the router to the external network

[07:28] <timotimo> and if they work on that stuff via SMB, they probably didn't use version control either?

[07:28] <brrt> i haven't seen messing up everything

[07:28] <brrt> oh, they did

[07:28] <brrt> subversion

[07:28] <brrt> over smb

[07:28] <timotimo> OK, that's less bad than i thought

[07:28] <brrt> :-D

[07:28] <timotimo> pretty bad, but not terribly bad.

[07:28] <brrt> no, the no-version-control shop i worked on was also the no-local-installation-ever shop

[07:29] <brrt> 'test it in a subdirectory' that kind of stuff

[07:29] <timotimo> well, suffice to say there's better ways to approach software development

[07:29] <brrt> fortunately

[07:31] <timotimo> most of the time i'm convinced i'm a pretty mediocre programmer, but when i hear these stories i go "there are people like that *employed* out there?!"

[07:32] <FROGGS> hehe

[07:32] <nebuchadnezzar> timotimo: hopefully, I can feel like a god, sometimes ;-)

[07:33] *** odc joined
[07:37] <brrt> :-) although if you think that, there's an important aspect you're missing out on

[07:37] <brrt> these people are indeed employed, out there

[07:37] <timotimo> and i am not! :P

[07:37] <brrt> therefore, somebody believes they bring some value to the company

[07:37] <brrt> why not? self-employed?

[07:38] <timotimo> more or less; i just changed into a different kind of more-or-less employedness and i don't know what to call it yet

[07:38] <FROGGS> are you married now? O.o

[07:38] <timotimo> i'm in the kind of more-or-less employedness where i do stuff and get money for it, so that's fine

[07:38] <FROGGS> ahh, money, then no :o)

[07:39] <brrt> oh, i see

[07:39] <brrt> so thats not unemployed as i'd count it

[07:39] <brrt> :-)

[07:39] <timotimo> right

[07:39] <brrt> in that regards i think we live in some confusing times

[07:40] <timotimo> but it's not a traditional job type of deal where i go to an office or cubicle daily and work 9/5; and i'm not being paid by the hour

[07:41] <brrt> let me hazard a guess and say you're under 40? :-)

[07:41] <timotimo> that is correct

[07:41] <timotimo> though not under half that

[07:42] <brrt> i'd also guess that

[07:42] <brrt> hmm

[07:42] <brrt> 25?

[07:42] <timotimo> yup

[07:42] <brrt> then.. i'm older than you

[07:42] <brrt> i'm 26

[07:43] <brrt> :-D

[07:43] <timotimo> could be worse :P

[07:43] <brrt> a bit

[07:45] <brrt> \o lizmat_

[07:45] <brrt> are you in orlando now?

[07:51] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/0c4aa629f01c5b1bd097

[07:51] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: that is MoarVM/nqp/rakudo HEAD

[07:51] <nebuchadnezzar> thanks a lot

[07:51] <FROGGS> my MoarVM is in C:\, like my nqp and rakudo is

[07:52] <FROGGS> but only --prefix (C:\nqp\install) matters

[07:52] <nebuchadnezzar> so I understood the setup.pm correctly, the lib is in bin/ ;-)

[07:52] <FROGGS> and, btw, gist has a bug... it added the ten newlines in the gist for me, and I can't edit them away

[07:52] <timotimo> FROGGS: your C:\ must look very messy!

[07:53] <FROGGS> timotimo: no, just these three extra dirs :o)

[07:53] <FROGGS> okay, and strawberry and Perl64...

[07:53] <timotimo> :P

[07:53] <FROGGS> and cygwin64 and panda

[07:53] <FROGGS> :P

[07:53] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: the lib is in bin, aye

[07:54] <FROGGS> that was needed for windows AFAIK

[07:54] *** donaldh joined
[07:54] <FROGGS> would be nice to move it elsewhere, and I guess a flag when building the moar executable will do

[07:55] <nebuchadnezzar> but the “elsewhere” must be in some kind of load-path ?

[07:55] <FROGGS> yes, like LD_LIBRARY_PATH on unixes

[07:56] <brrt> perl64 has a confusing name

[07:57] <brrt> and windows doesn't have LD_LIBRARY_PATH :-)

[07:57] <brrt> it just has PATH

[07:58] <brrt> and dynamically-loaded libraries (DLL's, or SO on unix / posix) must also be present in PATH

[07:58] <brrt> which explains why C:\Windows\ is such a mess :-)

[07:59] <nebuchadnezzar> step1: make it works the same but add configuration options ;-)

[07:59] <FROGGS> MAIN_LIBS = /libpath:. moar.dll.lib <-- that is in current Makefile

[08:00] <FROGGS> and I suppose the /libpath wants to be: /libpath:. /libpath:..\lib

[08:02] <FROGGS> brrt: so /libpath is not about finding the lib at runtime?

[08:02] <brrt> hmmmm

[08:03] <brrt> i don't.... think i know the answer to that

[08:03] <brrt> :-)

[08:03] <FROGGS> I mean, on BSDs you distinguish between linktime and runtime... I just don't know what windows does

[08:04] <brrt> i suppose windows does the same, but it is flexible

[08:04] <brrt> i.e. loading dynamic libraries at runtime is a normal thing for windows programs to do

[08:04] <brrt> that said

[08:05] <brrt> i'm only sure about the load order: directory-of-binary, PATH

[08:06] <FROGGS> perhaps I have time to try that later

[10:10] <jnthn> afternoon, #moarvm

[10:11] <jnthn> I was gonna ask brrt if he had any questions, but looks like he's on lucnh break too :

[10:26] <brrt> hi jnthn :-)

[10:26] <brrt> ow, shame

[10:30] <woolfy> brrt: indeed, lizmat and me and TimToady and many others are in Orlando now.

[10:31] <FROGGS> woolfy: lucky you are :o)

[10:32] <brrt> how is the wheather? :-)

[10:32] <brrt> weather

[10:34] <woolfy> The weather is hot and humid, reaching 35+C. Not plesant to walk outdoors.  At night still 18+C..  Indoors there's AC's everywhere.

[10:35] <woolfy> Lucky?  Well...  yeah, we have fun. :-)

[10:35] <brrt> oh yes, florida

[10:36] <brrt> i don't think i could stand the weather there very long, but as you said, AC :-)

[10:36] <brrt> will the talks be broadcast?

[10:36] <woolfy> lizmat and I both have a talk later today. I even have a lightning talk this morning.  Yep, starting the day with lightning talks.  I'm a bit nervous.  I also have to do camera work after the lightning talks start.

[10:36] <woolfy> Yep, all is video-d.

[10:37] <woolfy> I dunno if life broadcast.  There will be very little Perl 6 by the way.

[10:40] <woolfy> life broadcast -> live broadcast...

[10:40] <brrt> i've seen that

[10:40] <brrt> (the small amount of perl6)

[10:40] <brrt> what will you talk about?

[10:40] <brrt> did you bring the camel to the states, too? :-p

[10:43] <woolfy> My talk will be about marketing.  Same talk I did in Utrecht, Poznan, Prague, Paris.  Well, adapted again.

[10:43] <woolfy> Camel and books are here indeed.

[10:44] <brrt> how... even?

[10:44] <brrt> cool, though

[10:44] <brrt> no problem at customs?

[10:48] <woolfy> brrt: simple.  Look at https://www.flickr.com/photos/wendyga/sets/72157644316048078/ and understand...

[10:48] <woolfy> Nope, no problems at customs.  :-)

[10:48] <brrt> small camels :-)

[10:49] <brrt> https://www.flickr.com/photos/wendyga/14026777048/in/set-72157644316048078 lol

[10:53] <woolfy> Books and camel: https://www.flickr.com/photos/wendyga/14026862937/in/set-72157644316048078

[11:03] <timotimo> aaw, not much perl6? is perl6 dead? :(

[11:06] <woolfy> Perl 6 is not very rich and its profets did not go over the ocean, or are otherwise occupied.

[11:06] <woolfy> The main prophet is here though.  Yay TimToady.

[13:20] *** jnthn joined
[13:45] *** btyler joined
[13:50] *** FROGGS joined
[13:51] <FROGGS> about speed of P5/P6, I guess it will be like shock => disbelieving => ignorance, and a few more interested people who turned in the other direction at step #2

[13:53] <brrt> i hope so

[13:54] <FROGGS> but let's get fast first :o)

[13:54] <FROGGS> (and bugfree)

[14:04] <cognominal__> that was short

[14:05] <FROGGS> LIVE: https://www.youtube.com/user/yapcna/featured

[14:18] *** colomon joined
[14:33] <brrt> bugfree, first :-)

[14:41] <nwc10> no-one is going to switch from Perl 5 to Perl 6 because of speed

[14:42] <nwc10> if they want speed, other already faster languages exist

[14:42] <nwc10> just need to be fast "enough"

[14:42] <nwc10> I think that the first head turner/mindshare grabber is going to be concurrency

[14:43] <nwc10> stuff you simply *can't do* in Perl 5, at any speed.

[14:51] <brrt> tbh, i don't think a lot of perl5 folks are still going to switch to perl6, because if you're still writing perl5 by now, you're probably heavily invested in it

[14:52] <brrt> exception - if you think something like mojo is really cool, which i do

[14:56] <_sri> nwc10: actually, for me personally comparable performance to perl5 is very important (faster is nice, but i don't care too much about that)

[15:00] <brrt> i think performance is important

[15:01] *** nebuchad` joined
[15:09] <jnthn> Well, single thread speed being within a factor of 2 + run on 4 threads = 2 times faster... :)

[15:10] <jnthn> Well, sort of :P

[15:11] <jnthn> But I figure processing web requests is by and large going to have sufficiently independent tasks that it can scale out well.

[15:11] <jnthn> Anyway, yes, bug-free first. :)

[15:11] <jnthn> Or close enough few notice the bugs ;P

[15:27] <brrt> :-)

[15:27] <brrt> \o, long time no chat, how was travel?

[15:29] <brrt> (i was shocked, by the way, by how big a difference the jitted code still made)

[15:29] <brrt> i can only imagine how big a difference can come from 'real' codegen :-)

[15:33] <brrt> then again, i guess i know that answer, it's basically luajit's whole game

[15:38] <jnthn> Not home until Thursday.

[15:44] * jnthn has a sore throat and guesses he should find something spicy...alas, no Indian restaurants in this town :(

[15:44] <jnthn> Yeah, it's just a couple of hundred kms short of being in the arctic circle

[15:51] <brrt> hmmm... for a sore throat you might better get acetaminophen :-) (or paracetamol, whatever you want to call it)

[15:55] <jnthn> got varius of those already :)

[15:55] <brrt> fair enough :-)

[15:58] <brrt> i'm really off for pizza now :-) see you later this evening maybe?

[16:00] <jnthn> I'll be about, yeah.

[16:00] <jnthn> Just planning dinner and a walk

[16:00] <jnthn> o/

[16:18] <hoelzro> libpath is only used for .moarvm files, right?

[16:18] <hoelzro> or is it also used for .so's?

[16:22] <hoelzro> oh, apparently it's both

[16:23] <hoelzro> it seems that all of the ops needed by NQP are provided by MoarVM itself, but Rakudo has custom ops.  Is that accurate?

[16:24] <jnthn> Yes

[16:24] <jnthn> Only Rakudo has ext ops.

[21:35] <jnthn> brrt: Also, doesn't need doing for now, but a further opt in the future (for memory, not speed) will be to check if the bytecode is below the size limit for inlining, and if it's greater than that then we needn't keep around the optimized bytecode version of it.
