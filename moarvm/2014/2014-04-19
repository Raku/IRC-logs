[12:41] <dalek> MoarVM: small cleanups, and removed a needless MVMROOT

[12:41] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/18c6079dcd

[12:50] <jnthn> JimmyZ: uh, put that setup flag back, please

[12:50] <jnthn> I need that for somehting

[12:50] <jnthn> Rest looks fine

[12:51] <jnthn> oh, I see why you don't need it

[12:51] <jnthn> But that's not a cleanup. That's an obfuscation.

[12:54] <JimmyZ> ah....

[12:56] <dalek> MoarVM: re-add setup var

[12:56] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f318012089

[12:56] <jnthn> Thanks

[12:56] <jnthn> JimmyZ++

[12:56] <JimmyZ> np

[12:56] <jnthn> oh argh

[12:56] <jnthn> wait

[12:57] <jnthn> You didn't fix what bothered me

[12:57] <jnthn> The duplicate call the queue poll

[12:58] <JimmyZ> what's wrong with it?

[12:58] <jnthn> Mine had one call and it was really easy to see we were just polling for values in a loop

[12:58] <jnthn> Now you have to read the if and then the thing at the end of the loop

[13:01] <JimmyZ> I think it's the  same except mine avoids multi-assign setup=1 in the loop

[13:02] <jnthn> Fine, I'll just make it how I want myself. It's better than wasting time arguing with you. :/

[13:04] <JimmyZ> hehe :{

[13:04] <JimmyZ> :P

[13:04] <dalek> MoarVM: revert cleanups in setup_work function

[13:04] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5889985499

[13:11] <JimmyZ> jnthn: I don't quite understand when needs MVM_ASSIGN_REF ...

[13:14] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Any assignment of one MVMCollectable into memory managed by another.

[13:15] <JimmyZ> Thanks, I think I get it now

[13:16] <jnthn> The only common exception is when assigning to a register

[13:17] <jnthn> Because a MVMFrame is not collectable

[13:17] <jnthn> Taht's why all the register writes don't have to be write-barriered.

[13:18] <JimmyZ> That seems to reduce the gc pressure.

[13:19] <jnthn> Well, it avoids a ton of checks on every single register assignment, for sure.

[13:19] <jnthn> Which will make JIT a bunch less painful
