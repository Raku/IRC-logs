[09:32] <timotimo> there's some way to include a little travis status icon in the readme section of the github page

[09:32] <timotimo> do you know how to do that? is that useful for us?

[19:48] <dalek> MoarVM: fix pointer to pointer native cast

[19:48] <dalek> MoarVM:

[19:48] <dalek> MoarVM: Which means that we can dereference a pointer, which is way better than a noop.

[19:57] <dalek> MoarVM/cglobal: 4f1d397 | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/core/ (5 files):

[19:57] <dalek> MoarVM/cglobal: refactor nativecallglobal

[19:57] <dalek> MoarVM/cglobal:

[19:57] <dalek> MoarVM/cglobal: It will just return a pointer, that we can cast later to the desired type.
