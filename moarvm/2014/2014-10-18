[13:01] <timotimo> the decont_all that's put into the nativecall MAST Op ... it can't get jitted because param_sp_o

[13:01] <timotimo> can we get that to work better?

[13:01] <timotimo> i don't even know exactly why param_sp_o gets emitted sometimes

[13:02] * timotimo tries $args instead of @args

[13:05] *** colomon joined
[13:07] <timotimo> seems like that gives the same op

[13:10] <timotimo> er

[13:10] <timotimo> i meant to write param_rp_o

[13:10] <timotimo> "required positional object", right? how come we can't jit that :S

[13:11] <timotimo> we don't jit named parameters? or something like that?

[13:12] <timotimo> i differentiate between relative and absolute move_to and line_to with a :relative at the end

[13:12] <timotimo> seems like the jit doesn't like that so much

[13:16] <timotimo> oh interesting

[13:16] <timotimo> 10 bails on "multicachefind"

[13:16] <timotimo> that should be easy

[13:19] <moritz> does removing reasons to bail actually improve performance measurably?

[13:23] <timotimo> depends entirely!

[13:23] <timotimo> it's just more stuff i can do

[13:23] <timotimo> i'd think moving between jit and interpeter has a tiny amount of cost

[13:23] <timotimo> otherwise we can inline and stuff

[13:24] <timotimo> hm. invokewithcapture follows all instances of multicachefind

[13:24] <timotimo> invokey ops are a bit harder

[13:25] <timotimo> brrt will have to do something about this :

[13:25] <timotimo> :P

[13:26] <timotimo> the three ops that bail the most in my game are: param_sn and param_rp_o with 45 frames each

[13:26] <timotimo> 26 frames with param_sp

[13:26] <timotimo> 10 with multicachefind (and after that invokewithcapture)

[13:26] <timotimo> 9 argconst_s, 7 scgetobjidx

[13:28] <timotimo> exception, setobjsc, setcodeobj, captureposelems, capturehasnameds, reprname, param_on2_o

[13:28] <timotimo> newexception, isinvokable, getcomp, ctx, cmp_n,

[13:28] <timotimo> all after that have 2 or 1 bails
