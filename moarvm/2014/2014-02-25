[02:20] <hoelzro> timotimo: I don't know what you mean by that

[02:21] <hoelzro> FROGGS_: I took a brief look, but my moar fu is not good enough

[02:21] <hoelzro> I'm hoping to get someone to fix it for me =)

[19:53] <[Coke]> diakopter: any changes to host06's security today?

[19:54] <[Coke]> (my key is no longer working)

[20:01] <moritz> [Coke]: you haven't misspelled the username by chance? that's usually what happened to me when my keys don't work anymore :-)

[20:09] * timotimo usually puts a "Username" line in the matching section of the .ssh/config

[20:11] <benabik> (.ssh/config)++

[20:38] <timotimo> MVMStaticFrame  [================================================== 1312 - does this seem sensible? it's from a long-running t/spec/integration/advent2009-day06.rakudo.moar

[21:11] <[Coke]> moritz: I never type the userid, so that'd be hard.

[21:11] <[Coke]> the change to host06 was that I can't use it anymore, btw. trying to get setup on host07.
