[02:22] <hoelzro> I made a PR so that others could discuss my change instead of me brashly merging it in

[02:23] <hoelzro> please let me know if this is a terrible idea =)

[19:42] <jnthn> hoelzro: Your idea makes sense to me at first blush

[19:43] <jnthn> I suspect the way it is now is a foolish consistency, and I'd prefer a sane default over that. :)

[19:43] <jnthn> (Also, I didn't actually know "free the things" was the current way it was. Probably I shoulda thought about it at some point. :))

[20:40] <hoelzro> jnthn: I think it would be best to have traits one can add to specify how memory management should be done, but this should do for now

[20:40] <hoelzro> do you mind if I push that to master, then?

[20:42] <jnthn> hoelzro: +1 on the traits

[20:42] <jnthn> hoelzro: +1 on the push to master too; better to get it out there for testing against the module ecosystem

[20:42] <jnthn> I think it's the right thing.

[20:42] <hoelzro> cool, thanks!

[20:44] <jnthn> hoelzro: Please can you file an issue in the nqp repo that notes JVM also needs to track this?

[20:44] <hoelzro> jnthn: you got it

[20:44] <jnthn> Uh, and Parrot too I guess.

[20:44] <jnthn> That's likely the eaiser of the two.

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: d9a2bc8 | jonathan++ | / (3 files):

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: Update site for latest release.

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org:

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: Includes homepage and releases history update. Also, the roadmap is

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: given an overhaul to re-focus it on providing things we will need

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: soon in Rakudo, and add many items for the future (without goal dates,

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: since they are not blockers for Rakudo, and can be picked off in the

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: near future or the more distant future as resources are available to

[22:09] <dalek> moarvm.org: do them).

[22:10] <jnthn> We also sound a bit more sure of ourselves on the homepage now, 'cus we are, well, a bit more sure of ourselves. :)

[22:10] <jnthn> Unless you're on OSX... :P

[22:17] <lizmat> indeed  -(

[22:18] * jnthn will have to get back on the bug hunt with that after the weekend.

[22:21] <jnthn> Sleep time; 'night :)

[22:22] <lizmat> gnight jnthn
