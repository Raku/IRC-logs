[21:21] <japhb> o/

[21:22] <timotimo> heyo brrt :)

[21:22] <timotimo> how are you today?

[21:22] <timotimo> did you get further with your bloggage?

[21:22] <brrt> no... not really :-$

[21:23] <brrt> i had a pretty good idea of what i wanted to blog but i forgot

[21:27] <timotimo> oh!

[21:35] <brrt> hmmm

[21:35] <brrt> got any good blogging topics?

[21:38] <timotimo> hum

[21:38] <timotimo> you could blog about specifics of how register selection is going to work?

[21:39] <timotimo> or maybe talk about what the roadmap would look like to get an ARMv9 target for the jit?

[21:39] <brrt> hmm

[21:39] <timotimo> or maybe details about how you'd change the way params will get passed

[21:40] <timotimo> or maybe how the optimization will work that'd make invocations cheaper

[21:41] <brrt> hmmm :-)

[21:41] <brrt> those are good topics, yes

[21:41] <timotimo> lots of topics, now pick what you like most or come up with more ones

[21:41] * brrt will work on something

[21:43] <timotimo> cool :)

[21:51] <brrt> java.util.Set, y u no have an intersect or difference method

[21:52] <timotimo> :o

[21:52] <timotimo> it must have that

[21:53] <brrt> you'd think so, yes

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: implement nqp::closefhi which retuns the exit code of a pipe

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM:

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: nqp::openpipe returns a file handle one can read from, but since such an

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: opened pipe is actually a spawned process we also need its exit code to

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: know if it run cleanly. Use nqp::closefhi on such a file handle if you

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: are interested in the exit code, nqp::closefh if you are not.

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: ad5ce15 | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/io/syncpipe.c:

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: also consider result of waitpid when closing pipe

[21:57] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ad5ce15fc0

[22:07] <timotimo> brrt: of course i'm always happiest about blog posts that accompany some sort of implementation :P

[22:08] <timotimo> but i can hardly ask for other people to do work when they have less time than me and still get more done than me ...

[22:08] <brrt> yeah, that's going to be an issue

[22:09] <brrt> 'i implemented a few ops this week, and it was awesome o.O'

[22:09] <brrt> but seriously, within a week or two i'm going to have greater amounts of time

[22:20] * brrt afk for tonight :-)
