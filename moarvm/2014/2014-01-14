[00:04] <nwc10> jnthn: that gets it past that test (19 - it's a TODO) and 20

[00:04] <nwc10> waiting to see what 21 and 22 are

[00:05] <jnthn> ok

[00:06] <nwc10> CPU hungry, whatever else they are

[00:35] <timotimo> is that on a torture-gc-build?

[15:07] <jnthn> "MVMCallCapture cannot be copied" - just menas your Moar is behind.

[15:08] <FROGGS> jnthn: why don't we print that instead then?

[15:08] <FROGGS> :o)

[15:09] <nwc10> jnthn: slow thing is interminably slow, and I'm not sure if will actually complete

[15:09] <jnthn> FROGGS: 'cus nobody is bothering to keep NQP_REVISION or MOAR_REVISION up to date yet :)

[15:09] <nwc10> and the Moar continuation test in NQP doesn't seem to be much "faster" :-)

[15:10] <nwc10> which is makeing me wonder if it (at least) has got into a loop

[15:10] <jnthn> nwc10: huh...didn't think the cont tests did too terribly much...

[15:10] <nwc10> which I guess I can figure out by taking an unmodified moar and recording the sequence of OPs dispatched

[15:10] <nwc10> and then seeing where my torture version diverges

[15:10] <nwc10> well, they don't

[15:11] <nwc10> but the startup with the torture code running took 3 or so minutes

[15:11] <jnthn> o.O

[15:11] <nwc10> but that's not 8 hours

[16:25] <Guest1338> Hi! I've checked MoarVM src files using CppCat (new static analysis tool released today, light version of PVS-Studio), the results are here http://goo.gl/VQN678 if anyone is interested

[16:25] <Guest1338> PNG 152 kb

[16:25] <timotimo> oh cool

[16:26] <timotimo> can you export these as some kind of text format?

[16:26] <timotimo> for easy copy/pasting?

[16:27] <Guest1338> I'll try, but it's just a VS window

[16:28] <timotimo> maybe an OCR software could help me here

[16:29] <[Coke]> that might be the wrong approach. :P

[16:29] <timotimo> okay, maybe Guest1338 can attach the MSVC++ debugger to MSVC++ and find the strings in memory

[16:29] <timotimo> and then dump them out

[16:29] <diakopter> weeel

[16:47] <timotimo> my OCR attempt failed miserably

[16:47] <timotimo> m Nurvvmd hmzlmn pppp ppm a papa Mnarwa rEprS.( 59

[16:48] <diakopter> lolz

[16:48] <[Coke]> daily moar run nearly complete.

[16:51] <jnthn> I think if you click on one of those error,s Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C you get 'em copied as text

[16:51] <jnthn> But I can study 'em from image...when I haz tuits (not now)

[16:51] <[Coke]> r: say 27938 / 28462 # ish

[16:51] <camelia> rakudo-parrot 4f66ce, rakudo-jvm 4f66ce: OUTPUT«0.981589␤»

[16:51] <FROGGS> O.o

[16:51] <FROGGS> wow

[16:52] <timotimo> amazing! :D

[16:52] <[Coke]> I would say that number's large enough to add it to the bot.

[16:52] <timotimo> agreed.

[16:52] <[Coke]> oh. no, it's still on a branch, nevermind.

[16:52] <FROGGS> if we fix unicode stuff and socket we might ending up at 120%

[16:52] <timotimo> well, get it merged is my suggestion then :)

[16:52] <timotimo> gotta run now

[16:52] <[Coke]> someone remind me when the merge happens so I can fixup the daily run. :)

[16:53] <FROGGS> I really need to test perl6-m on my mac VM

[16:53] <FROGGS> that could convince jnthn++ I think :o)

[16:54] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/8250608 updated.

[16:54] <[Coke]> FROGGS: oh, good point. I can kick off a run on my machine.

[16:54] <[Coke]> will do so tonight when I'm at home.

[16:54] <FROGGS> [Coke]: yeah, it would be awesome if it builds

[17:16] <timotimo> so few failure!

[17:16] <timotimo> much congratulate

[17:17] <diakopter> scare so

[18:59] <grondilu> the 'Expression 'ascii[i] <= 127'' thing could be met with defining ascii as constant unsigned char instead of constant char, couldn't it?

[19:29] <grondilu> sorry I got carried away and submited a pull request but this has not been tested at all.  I don't know how to remove pull requests on github, so feel free to ignore or something.

[19:29] <arnsholt> I think you can just close it

[19:30] <grondilu> done
