[12:31] *** john3213 joined
[12:34] <brrt> i'm wondering shoud i research-and-blog about further use of dynasm or about spesh first?

[12:36] *** john3213 left
[12:55] * lizmat wouldn't mind a blog post about spesh :-)

[12:56] <brrt> seems like a good idea too

[12:56] <brrt> spesh has many moving parts

[12:59] <lizmat> afk again&

[13:00] <brrt> see you

[13:06] *** woolfy joined
[13:12] * brrt is wondering whether we should build a 'push notification service' for the linux desktop

[13:22] <masak> +1 to blog post about spesh

[13:28] <brrt> i hardly have a choice now, do i? :-)

[13:28] <brrt> well, its what i promised so lets do it

[13:35] *** ggoebel111115 joined
[13:37] <brrt> (i'm in a bad mood because all the results of my experiments have been wrong)

[13:39] <timotimo> what do you mean by 'push notification service' for the desktop and what do you mean by "we"? :)

[13:41] <brrt> we = people who'd like to :-)

[13:41] <timotimo> what is the motivation behind this project?

[13:41] <timotimo> i'm confused

[13:42] <brrt> push notification service = servers + protocol to which a network-connected device connects and listens for messages

[13:42] <timotimo> yeah

[13:42] <timotimo> i know what that is

[13:42] <brrt> the motivation is that polling is not so nice

[13:42] <brrt> and that apps on the linux desktop do not work together very well

[13:43] <brrt> and we should have better apps imho :-)

[13:43] <timotimo> oh

[13:43] <brrt> anyway, your opinion may vary  :-)

[13:43] <timotimo> well, qt has a websockets implementation now as well as spdy3

[13:44] <timotimo> that makes for good push notification stuff i bet

[13:44] <timotimo> you just have to do it :)

[13:44] <vendethiel> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { ^ $.letter $ } }; say A.new(letter => 'a').parse('a');

[13:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2dd18d: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[13:44] <timotimo> xmpp has pubsub

[13:44] <brrt> xmpp could work

[13:45] <timotimo> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { $( $.letter ) } }; say A.new(letter => "a").parse('a')

[13:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2dd18d: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[13:45] <timotimo> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { ${ $.letter } } }; say A.new(letter => "a").parse('a')

[13:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2dd18d: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[13:45] <brrt> anyway, i don't have tuits for such a project in the coming $period

[13:45] * vendethiel just realized he's not even on #perl6 :)

[13:45] <timotimo> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { <$.letter> } }; say A.new(letter => "a").parse('a')

[13:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2dd18d: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[13:45] <timotimo> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { <{ $.letter }> } }; say A.new(letter => "a").parse('a')

[13:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2dd18d: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[13:45] <timotimo> :\

[13:46] <timotimo> m: grammar A { has $.letter; regex TOP { "$.letter" } }; say A.new(letter => "a").parse('a')
