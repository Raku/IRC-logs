[13:31] * jnthn heads home tomorrow morning :)

[13:31] <jnthn> So the tuit supply should improve soon :)

[13:32] <FROGGS> \o/

[13:58] <[Coke]> jnthn: ++(welcome home)

[14:12] <jnthn> Yes, it'll be nice ot see it again :)

[14:14] <Juerd> To whoever upgraded bash on feather: thanks :)

[14:15] <Juerd> Only today I realised I was forgetting these.

[14:16] <jnthn> .oO( at least it was easy for pretty much anyone to get in and do it... ;) )

[14:17] <Juerd> Nah, I don't think anything with root was susceptible for that.

[14:18] <Juerd> Oh, or perhaps something was. bash is still the system shell on feather

[14:18] <Juerd> Let's fix that. rm /bin/sh; ln -s dash /bin/sh

[14:19] <Juerd> feather's going away soon, by the way

[14:19] <Juerd> What's the best mailinglist to announce this?

[14:20] <jnthn> Juerd: #perl6 is the best IRC channel...many more folks there than here...

[14:20] <FROGGS> and #parrot?

[14:20] <jnthn> Ah, true

[14:21] <jnthn> Of mailing lists, I guess perl6-compiler and perl6-language can't hurt.

[14:21] <Juerd> Okay

[14:22] <Juerd> My current plan is to switch it off in January and provide a new VPS specifically for those who need it for IRC.

[14:24] <Juerd> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8 May 25  2005 /etc/hostname

[14:24] <Juerd> Or maybe I shoud keep it running until May 25 2015 so that we can say it ran for 10 years.

[14:24] <Juerd> :P

[14:52] * JimmyZ needs it for irc ...

[15:09] <moritz> Juerd: fwiw I think I updated bash on all feathers, but I have lost overview :-)

[15:10] <jnthn> Time for some rest...long day tomorrow... &

[15:12] <Juerd> moritz: Thank you :)

[20:21] <brrt> \o

[20:22] <brrt> i've calculated the average (geometric mean) speedup caused by moar-jit in it's first release was 30%

[20:23] <FROGGS> nice!

[20:23] <FROGGS> I had guessed that :o)

[20:27] *** odc` joined
[20:30] <brrt> well, i had not. i had imagined there were too many benchmarks on which there would not be a lot of benefit

[21:12] <timotimo> so ...

[21:12] <timotimo> we'll want to make a thread not only block but ideally do work for another thread when it encounters a promise that another thread has created, right?

[21:12] <timotimo> but what would that look like?

[21:12] <timotimo> we can't really longjmp into the other's frame or something

[21:13] <timotimo> and we also can't just call into the other piece of work from await or something similar

[21:14] <brrt> no... that's basically green-threads-over-os-threads

[21:14] <brrt> let your kernel deal with that

[21:14] <brrt> make more threads instead

[21:14] <timotimo> mhm

[21:14] <brrt> we live in 64 bits these days

[21:15] <timotimo> so make 2**64 threads

[21:15] <brrt> all sorts of hacks aren't really all that necessary anymore with sufficient address space :-)

[21:21] <brrt> that said i don't know how / when threads are created in moarvm

[21:29] <timotimo> i suppose the scheduler code in perl6 land has some nqp op that spawns a thread and gives it a code object to run

[21:30] <timotimo> nqp::newthread

[21:34] <brrt> i see
