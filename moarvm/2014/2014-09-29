[10:58] <timotimo> hello sergot

[11:08] <brrt> hello timotimo, sergot

[11:08] <brrt> awefully quiet here

[11:11] <nine> The China office is holing their meetings mostly offline I've heard...

[11:14] <lizmat> I understand jnthn only has one more day in cn, so when he is back and de-jetlagged, all will be busy again  :-)

[11:14] <brrt> :-)

[11:14] <brrt> how are the preparations of APW going along?

[11:20] <timotimo> i'm doing a full-on writer's block thing for the thing i wanted to show there ...

[11:21] <nine> quite nicely :)

[11:34] <brrt> what do you want to show there? or is that still to be secrete

[11:34] <brrt> s/e$//

[11:36] <nine> I don't want to talk too much about it beforehand. Keep it more interesting there :)

[11:43] <brrt> fair enough

[12:59] <jnthn> evening, #moarvm

[12:59] <lizmat> evening, jnthn

[12:59] <jnthn> Yup, tomorrow is the last work day here in China. And Wed will be a very long journey.

[12:59] <lizmat> .oO( it took Marco Polo a lot longer :-)

[13:00] <jnthn> True ;)

[13:00] <timotimo> probably not the kind of journey you'll be using for productivity, right?

[13:00] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, laptop use on a plane is pretty uncomfy for me. I may get some thinking time in.

[13:00] <timotimo> that's totally fair

[13:00] <lizmat> timotimo: does your writers block also apply to the weekly ?

[13:00] <timotimo> i'm working on the weekly as we speak

[13:01] <lizmat> okidoki,...  otherwise it could maybe a burden to be shared ?

[13:01] <timotimo> i'll see how far i can get and then i'll ask you for assistance if needed :)

[13:01] <timotimo> thanks for the offer

[13:02] * jnthn did manage to write a talk title/abstract for APW yesterday evening :)

[13:02] <timotimo> \o/

[13:03] <brrt> jnthn++

[13:03] <brrt> will the apw talks be uploaded?

[13:03] <jnthn> Well, I'll publish slides as usual. Dunno if there's a recording plan.

[13:05] <brrt> fair enough :-)

[13:11] <timotimo> on that note:

[13:12] <timotimo> still waiting for more yapceu presentation recordings ...

[13:15] <lizmat> and you are not alone  :-(

[20:01] <brrt> libreoffice calc has to be the worst spreadsheet in the history of spreadsheets

[20:01] *** avuserow joined
[20:02] *** kjs_ joined
[20:02] <[Coke]> brrt: funny someone just told me the spreadsheet was the best libre offering (comparing it to the msproject-alike)

[20:02] <brrt> o.O

[20:02] <brrt> that says a lot i guess

[20:03] <brrt> hmm something is off i think in my calculations

[20:04] <brrt> the temperate regions do not reach 233K in winter usually

[20:07] <nine> that's....a bit chilly indeed

[20:28] <brrt> 269K seems more reasonable as an average
