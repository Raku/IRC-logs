[07:06] <FROGGS> nwc10: when I add things to a struct like that, do I have to care about alignment? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/03ac9a70f6dee026ab264767a59ab76379049bee#diff-beff3d4230b1ad1b250922477a3e1de5R39

[07:11] <timotimo> the c compiler will give you an alignment that won't blow up i believe

[07:12] <timotimo> this isn't performance critical, as in: you don't have more than a few MVMIOFileData in your working set at any given moment
