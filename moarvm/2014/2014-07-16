[07:09] <brrt> hmm, how would i trigger a decont?

[07:20] <brrt> hmm, i've a failing test case

[07:20] <brrt> yay

[07:20] <brrt> (better yet: an isolated failing test case)

[07:23] <brrt> as in, it's not failing in the compiler but in the script

[07:34] <brrt> now, why does this fail

[07:36] <brrt> interestingly, it seems that unless_o Just Works

[07:46] <FROGGS__> well, that's good to hear :o)

[07:49] <brrt> emphasis on /seems/ :-)

[09:15] <jnthn> It's not that an exception somehow got thrown at some point?

[09:16] <jnthn> I realized, though, that throws from C-land actually lngjmp back into the interpreter...

[11:16] <brrt> not yet

[11:17] <brrt> interestingly, if i remove the branch in the nqp file, the script works well

[11:18] <jnthn> Can you isolate the issue to the JITting of a particular op?

[11:18] <jnthn> Could it be to do with the "did it invoke" code?

[11:18] <brrt> likely

[11:22] <brrt> hmm check this out: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/moar-jit/foo.nqp#L24

[11:22] <brrt> change that 100 to 50,  and the script outputs 50

[11:25] <jnthn> wtf...

[11:26] <brrt> yes

[11:38] <jnthn> // object is type object (not concrete)

[11:38] <jnthn> That does jump if zero?

[11:38] <brrt> yes

[11:39] <jnthn> We want to *not* decont if it's a type object.

[11:39] <brrt> letmesee

[11:39] <brrt> and that seems to be what it does?

[11:40] <brrt> oh, right

[11:40] <brrt> ugh, much confuse

[11:40] <brrt> let's fix that and see what it does

[11:40] <brrt> (i'm afraid not much in this case)

[11:40] <jnthn> Well, is_type_object sounds like it will put non-zero if it *is* a type object... :)

[11:41] <brrt> right

[11:41] <brrt> that's precisely what it ought to do

[12:36] <brrt> it's kind of hard to breakpoint smrt_numify

[12:37] <brrt> and to be honest.. it's kind of unlikely that it's really the problem

[12:39] <brrt> because /without/ if_o and unless_o It Just Works

[12:39] <timotimo> damn :(

[12:40] <brrt> yes

[12:41] <timotimo> but decont works fine?

[12:41] <brrt> who knows?

[12:41] <brrt> it's kind of hard to test without an explicit test case

[12:41] <timotimo> ah, fair enough

[12:42] <timotimo> could always go back to writing your frames with the mast compiler ;)

[12:42] <brrt> possibly

[12:44] <brrt> ok, smrt_numify is broken, that's for sure

[12:44] <brrt> somehow

[12:46] <jnthn> Is it not missing the control_invokish?

[12:47] <jnthn> oh, that's done automatically

[12:47] <brrt> it ought to be, and it doesn't seem to be missing

[12:51] <brrt> somehow, it seems as if the Bool() frame walks all over the bar frame

[13:01] <jnthn> I guess the Bool frame is JITted too?

[13:03] <brrt> doesn't seem to be

[13:03] <brrt> takes param_rp_o

[13:03] <brrt> anyway, i'm in the breakpoint as we speak

[13:06] * brrt wonders whether it has anything to do with special_return

[13:07] <jnthn> I don't immediately see an issue there; you're using the normal return code-path that triggers that...

[13:08] * brrt is still stepping through the code

[13:32] * brrt thinks this is exhausting

[13:33] <jnthn> Was stepping through the code not informative?

[13:34] <brrt> hmm... yes, in the sense that 'all appears to be normal'

[13:34] <timotimo> the perl6.org/compilers/features matrix still lists Promises and Supplies as "no time based", i can fix that to be a green + now, right?

[13:35] <jnthn> Yeah, time-based stuff works on Moar now

[13:37] <timotimo> i knew most of it did, i wasn't sure if we're at 100%

[13:37] <timotimo> that's good to know

[13:37] <timotimo> i'll update it later today. AFK for an unknown amount of time now.

[13:49] <brrt> no progress yet :-(

[13:51] <jnthn> aww :(

[13:51] <jnthn> Hard problem is hard.

[13:52] *** btyler joined
[14:46] <brrt> very hard indeed

[14:53] *** btyler joined
[15:00] *** raiph joined
[15:01] <brrt> :-(

[15:02] <jnthn> brrt: Is that "argh now I know why it's wrong", or "argh I can't figure it out"?

[15:02] <brrt> argh can't figure it out

[15:02] <brrt> *nothing* seems wrong

[15:03] <brrt> except that somehow, the 50 in the value is the value that is printed by nqp::say

[15:03] *** jnap joined
[15:07] <jnthn> Is nqp::say one of the ops we JIT?

[15:07] <brrt> yes, and i'm in the breakpoint

[15:07] <brrt> as we speak

[15:08] <jnthn> If you look at the spesh log, does the register passed to the say correspond to a register that 50 is put into inside of Bool?

[15:09] <brrt> hmm that'd be weir

[15:09] <brrt> d

[15:10] <brrt> i'll check

[15:10] <jnthn> Well, if we think it might be using the wrong registers, that might confirm or break the hypothesis.

[15:11] <brrt> very well :-)

[15:31] <brrt> it seems.. the Bool() frame is never speshed

[15:32] <jnthn> Oh?

[15:32] <brrt> yes

[15:32] <jnthn> That's odd given how often it's called.

[15:33] <jnthn> If you can get at it, what does sf->body.invocations have in it?

[15:33] <brrt> however... it is indeed the case that the 50.0 constant is in the 4th register

[15:33] <brrt> so that's got to be worth something

[15:33] <brrt> (the say is also in the 4th register)

[15:33] <jnthn> Also you put an nqp::say in the Bool method, does it get used?

[15:33] <brrt> yes

[15:33] <jnthn> s/get used/get said/

[15:34] <jnthn> OK

[15:34] <brrt> :'-(

[15:34] <jnthn> Is it "never spesh'd" or "never finishes specialization"?

[15:35] <jnthn> (There is the initialization of specialization which inserts logging, then the actual final spesh after logging which is triggered at frame exit time)

[15:35] <brrt> spesh doesn't seem to see it

[15:35] <brrt> the name of Bool() never comes up in the spesh log

[15:35] <brrt> anyway, i'll see if i can get at the invocations nr

[15:35] <jnthn> Oh...

[15:35] <jnthn> I think I can guess

[15:36] <jnthn> I'll bet the callsite doesn't have the "is interned" flag set.

[15:36] <brrt> that could well be, since it is a constant

[15:37] <brrt> defined at src/core/coerce.c line 10

[15:37] <jnthn> OK, so it's something about returning

[15:38] <brrt> actually, returning is what seems to be fine

[15:38] <jnthn> if (MVM_jit_enter_code(tc, cu, tc->cur_frame->spesh_cand->jitcode)) {

[15:38] <jnthn> Do we return 0 there?

[15:39] <jnthn> So we aren't actually forcing the just-invoked frame to return?

[15:39] <brrt> good question

[15:39] <jnthn> | mov RV, 1;

[15:39] <jnthn> | jmp ->out;

[15:39] <jnthn> Is what I see for  MVM_JIT_CONTROL_INVOKISH

[15:39] <jnthn> Which'd cause it to attempt the return, *if* I'm reading this all correctly.

[15:40] <brrt> well, no, because MVM_jit_enter switches this all arround

[15:40] <brrt> good fun, huh

[15:40] * brrt agrees this is confusing and will change it arround

[15:40] <brrt> but fwiw, the interpreted frame is actually invoked and i can step through it

[15:42] <brrt> invocations is 14, spesh_threshold is 10

[15:45] <jnthn> OK, and is tc->cur_frame->static_info->body.name pointing to a string Bool?

[15:45] <jnthn> Where is the code that handles returning into JITted stuff, ooc?

[15:54] <brrt> i'll look at the first thing first

[15:55] <brrt> hmm... how to print the MVMString in gdb?

[15:56] <brrt> yes

[15:56] <brrt> (you can call a function in gdb, apparantly)

[15:56] <jnthn> Look inside of the codepoints buffer

[15:56] <jnthn> ah, nice :)

[15:56] <jnthn> in VS too

[15:56] <timotimo> brrt: my python extension for moar can print MVMString for you

[15:56] <jnthn> OK, then what happens if you trace things back to after the return and when you're in the JITted code again, about the print the 50?

[15:57] * brrt will have to see how that's done

[15:57] <brrt> timotimo - how to use that extension?

[15:57] <brrt> i can breakpoint MVM_string_say, i think

[15:57] <timotimo> tools/moar-gdb.py  ← read the beginning of that

[15:58] <brrt> thanks :-)

[16:01] <brrt> the most mysterious thing of all is that the work buffer of the JIT frame is /not/ the same as the work buffer of the interpreted frame

[16:01] <brrt> so how can a value in one end up in the other

[16:03] <timotimo> oh, moar-gdb.py may need changes due to the strref?

[16:03] <jnthn> Question: can this be reproduced with if nqp::istrue($x) instead of if $x ?

[16:03] <jnthn> Uh, or whatever the variable was called :)

[16:04] <brrt> hmm

[16:04] <brrt> i'll try

[16:05] <brrt> actually, that'll give us another bug

[16:05] <brrt> ain't that fun

[17:44] <FROGGS__> :/

[17:44] <brrt> can't always get what you want

[17:44] <FROGGS__> yeah, sadly

[17:50] <rurban> gdb stepi

[17:51] <rurban> and disassemble /r %rip

[17:56] * brrt has tried that, and everything seems correct

[17:57] <rurban> then I would suspect one of your nonvolatile registers

[18:00] <brrt> well... that's possible of course

[18:02] <brrt> what type is type 2?

[18:05] <brrt> ok, hmm

[18:05] <brrt> i think i'm getting at something now

[18:07] <timotimo> cool! :)

[18:11] <brrt> or rather, a case wherein we /should/ jump out but don't, or something like that

[18:12] <brrt> i.e. the current frame isn't restored properly, or something like that

[18:23] <jnthn> ooh, mail tells me I have 2 accepted talks at YAPC::EU.

[18:27] <brrt> sure you are

[18:28] <nwc10> God would need a full talk, whereas Chuck Norris would only need a lightning talk?

[18:32] <timotimo> god would write the code to disk by striking it with lightning.

[19:18] <jnthn> Or you found the problem

[19:19] <jnthn> You can get it at 1024 and all should work

[19:19] <jnthn> I had it at that last night

[19:28] <brrt> problems around smart_numify persist

[19:29] <jnthn> Ah, so there were two bugs...

[19:29] <brrt> obviously :-)

[19:31] <brrt> at least two bugs, even

[19:31] <brrt> that said

[19:31] <brrt> i can't really find a fault wrt to unless_o and if_o

[19:31] <brrt> they Just Work, even though it is the Bool() frame that seems to override the current frame

[19:32] <brrt> i'll make this so much worse for all of us right now

[19:33] <brrt> because smrt_numify /does/ work w/o unless_o

[19:33] <jnthn> o.O

[19:33] <jnthn> It's not some weird stateful thing going on?

[19:34] <jnthn> What happens if you have multiple smrt_numify or multiple if_o in a frame?

[19:34] <brrt> good question

[19:35] <brrt> hahahaha

[19:35] <brrt> well, it is actually probably a weird / stateful thing

[19:36] <jnthn> oh my... :)

[19:36] <brrt> because in fact, the second time i call smrt_numify, i get a zero where a number should be

[19:36] <jnthn> Well, there we go then.

[19:36] * brrt now really suspects some kind of frame corruption

[19:37] <jnthn> So, diff the assembly we produce for the two cases to make sure the weird stateful thing isn't in the code-gen, and actually is at runtime?

[19:37] <brrt> good idea

[19:37] * jnthn hopes he's not being too much of a backseat debugger :)

[19:37] <jnthn> "No, turn LEFT at the breakpoint!"

[19:37] <FROGGS__> "Are we there yet?"

[19:38] <jnthn> "Can we stop to get icecream?"

[19:38] <FROGGS__> "I need a toilet!" :P

[19:38] <brrt> no, you're being a good help :-)

[19:39] <brrt> fascinating

[19:39] <FROGGS__> O.o

[19:39] <brrt> (what is fascinating, you ask? i'll tell, oh boy i'll tell)

[19:40] <jnthn> Did anybody else, as a kid, see "TO LET" signs on buildings up for rent and want to grafiti in an "I"? :)

[19:40] <brrt> no

[19:40] <brrt> but mostly because of non-native english, i think

[19:40] <jnthn> yes. :)

[19:40] <brrt> very few 'to let' signs here

[19:40] <jnthn> Right

[19:40] <jnthn> Te huur or something, right?

[19:40] <brrt> right

[19:40] <brrt> zu mietung, i believe, in german

[19:40] <lizmat> zu vermieten

[19:40] * jnthn hopes he actually got the word for "rent" and not a similar sounding one... :)

[19:41] <brrt> yes, you got the right word

[19:41] <jnthn> phew :)

[19:41] <FROGGS__> jnthn: about "TO LET", that doesn't work out well in germany :o)

[19:41] <lizmat> well, they're also for rent, in a way  :-)

[19:41] <brrt> it's really freaky to see a dutch word in the english-language channel

[19:41] <FROGGS__> but the first time I saw such a sign I thought: to let WHAT! WHAT?!

[19:42] <brrt> anyway, what's fascinating is this

[19:42] <brrt> i take a frame that numifies an object

[19:42] <brrt> when the JIT compiler kicks in, it 'stops working' so to speak

[19:42] <brrt> ehm... that's not right

[19:42] <brrt> it still seems to work

[19:42] <brrt> now i numify the object a second time

[19:43] <brrt> this time, after JIT, the second num is always 0

[19:43] <brrt> now instead of re-numifying the object, i copy the value of the first-numification

[19:43] <FROGGS__> jnthn: it seem to take hours using a 1024 nursery size :/

[19:44] <jnthn> FROGGS__: Well, that is the minimum...you could probably go somewhere in the middle...

[19:44] <FROGGS__> k

[19:44] <FROGGS__> will try that now

[19:44] <jnthn> brrt: huh...

[19:45] <brrt> yeah

[20:19] <FROGGS__> jnthn: when I disable spesh it hangs in an uv loop triggered by MVM_io_syncstream_read_line -> read_to_buffer

[20:21] <brrt> so many breakpoins

[20:22] <FROGGS__> :/

[20:29] <brrt> it means 'im getting there, though

[20:29] <jnthn> brrt++ # half of debugging is persistence...

[20:30] * brrt thinks it's 90% today

[20:44] <FROGGS__> in the assignment here:

[20:44] <FROGGS__> multi postfix:<-->(Num:D \a is rw) {  # XXX

[20:44] <FROGGS__> my $b = a;

[20:45] <FROGGS__> in op assign, the object 'cont' points to has all its attrs set to zero

[20:45] <FROGGS__> like owner and size

[20:46] <FROGGS__> this is called by:

[20:46] <FROGGS__> method lines($limit = *) {

[20:46] <FROGGS__> my $l = $limit ~~ Whatever ?? Inf !! $limit;

[20:46] <FROGGS__> gather while $l-- > 0 {

[20:46] <FROGGS__> (the example code calls lines())

[20:47] <timotimo> huh, that's curious

[21:38] <brrt> no, i'll tell you curious

[21:38] <brrt> somehow

[21:38] <brrt> my num64 argument is 0

[21:38] <brrt> even though the relevant register isn't 0

[21:40] <brrt> what the

[21:41] <brrt> ok, know what? i'm out, i don't get this /at all/

[21:42] <brrt> apparantly, MVM_coerce_n_s doesn't take the second argument as xmm1, after all

[21:42] <jnthn> o.O

[21:42] <brrt> MVM_coerce_n_s takes the second argument as xmm0

[21:42] <jnthn> 'cus the first argument is passed floating point?

[21:43] <brrt> now! what is really the question, is WHY DID THIS EVER WORK IN THE FIRST ****** PLACE

[21:43] <brrt> apparantly

[21:44] <timotimo> oooooh

[21:44] <brrt> the first argument is actually the threadcontext, in %rdi, where it ought to be

[21:44] <jnthn> brrt++ # finding the bug where it wasn't expected

[21:45] * brrt still can't believe that's really the cause of the bug

[21:46] <timotimo> oh

[21:46] <timotimo> will jitted code that handles "num" values benefit from the wider registers the cpu has to offer for floating point calculations?

[21:46] <timotimo> rather than collapsing it to a "shorter" register between each operation?

[21:47] <brrt> not yet timotimo

[21:47] <timotimo> but it could do that in the future?

[21:47] <brrt> currently, jitted code does nothing to keep intermediate values in the registers, but stores them into memory (work space) on every op

[21:48] <brrt> it will do that in the future, once i get full register selection in dynasm

[21:48] <timotimo> ah

[21:48] <brrt> once that happens, though, quite a few things will still have to change in the JIT :-)

[21:48] <brrt> nothing undoable, though

[21:49] <timotimo> we can't undo it once we've done it? oh no!

[21:49] <brrt> that was a dutch-ism, it seems

[21:49] <brrt> :-)

[21:49] <brrt> i meant nothing impossible :-)

[21:49] <hoelzro> "I always get my sin"

[21:49] <brrt> :-)

[21:49] <brrt> right

[21:50] <brrt> there must be german variants of that as well?

[21:53] <brrt> slight annoyance: win64 does what i implemented, but posix doesn't

[21:53] <brrt> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zthk2dkh.aspx see 3rd example of argument passing

[21:58] <brrt> argh, posix abi

[21:58] <jnthn> ugh

[21:59] <brrt> i quote for you: "Right-to-left order on the stack makes the handling of functions that take a variable number

[21:59] <brrt> of arguments simpler. The location of the first argument can always be computed statically, based

[21:59] <brrt> on the type of that argument. It would be difficult to compute the address of the first argument if

[21:59] <brrt> the arguments were pushed in left-to-right order."

[22:00] <brrt> yes, you read that correctly; if there's too much stuff, we push arguments on the stack, but - in right-to-left order

[22:00] <brrt> unlike microsofts abi

[22:00] <jnthn> oh my :)

[22:00] <jnthn> And, wtf. :)

[22:02] <brrt> i suspect i'll have some work rewriting MVM_jit_emit_call_c

[22:02] <brrt> :-)

[22:02] <brrt> as far as i can tell, microsoft just has you push arguments in left-to-right order

[22:02] <brrt> microsoft, fwiw, has just won quite a few karma points in my book

[22:02] *** ren1us joined
[22:05] <ren1us> m: class A{}; my $a = A.new; my $ref = $a.WHERE; my $bogus = False; for ^10000 { if $ref ne $a.WHERE { $bogus = True; }; }; say $bogus;

[22:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1372dc: OUTPUT«True␤»

[22:06] <ren1us> apparently that's fine and the GC can do whatever it wants with regard to moving things around (so sayeth masak), but this makes the use of object keys in hashes a mess.

[22:07] <hoelzro> (it seems like, at least on mokudo, .WHICH should not use .WHERE as the default impl)

[22:07] <jnthn> .WHERE is completely allowed to change.

[22:08] <jnthn> .WHICH is using .WHERE as a stop-gap.

[22:08] <jnthn> The issue exists on JVM too, giving it can also move objects and we use the default object hash code.

[22:09] <jnthn> The challenge is fixing this without making every single object - whether we hash it or not - bigger.

[22:09] <jnthn> (Yes, there's some ideas for how. Just didn't get to the top of the todo list yet. But I agree it needs dealing with, and .WHICH needs to be stable.)

[22:09] <brrt> i... think i'm going to sleep over the fix tonight

[22:09] <hoelzro> jnthn: the JVM can move objects?  I think that the default hashCode() impl used ojbect location

[22:10] <hoelzro> s/think/thought, s/ojbect/object/

[22:10] <brrt> i'd be very surprised if the JVM couldn't ever move objects

[22:10] <brrt> i've heard of more than one implementation of a moving gc

[22:10] <brrt> (in fact, JVM's have been a hotbed of GC research for a while now)

[22:11] <brrt> a totally correct solution doesn't seem all that easy

[22:12] <hoelzro> no =/

[22:13] <jnthn> hoelzro: Well, curiously, here's what the docs say: "As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects."

[22:14] <hoelzro> ah ha

[22:14] <hoelzro> interesting

[22:14] <brrt> see you tomorrow!

[22:15] <brrt> \o

[22:15] *** brrt left
[22:15] *** klaas-janstol joined
[22:15] <hoelzro> night brrt

[22:18] <jnthn> I *think* glancing the HotSpot code in http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/hotspot/file/tip/src/share/vm/runtime/synchronizer.cpp that it's actually cheating and storing the hash value in some GC related slot...

[22:18] <hoelzro> weeee

[22:19] <hoelzro> figures

[22:19] <jnthn> Anyway, the solution is heavily GC-intertwined

[22:19] <jnthn> Which is what all the ones I've come up with would be too

[22:21] <hoelzro> I figured =)

[22:21] <ren1us> why not just make the hash the instant (now()) of the object's creation or something, effectively removing the whole memory address thing from the equation?

[22:21] <hoelzro> ren1us: thanks for bringing this up

[22:22] <hoelzro> ren1us: I think jnthn wants to avoid increasing a moar object's size if he can

[22:22] <jnthn> ren1us: Yes, but how/where do we store that?

[22:22] * hoelzro decommute &

[22:22] <jnthn> Also, that's a really bad hash code, given multi-threading...

[22:22] <ren1us> fair point.

[22:23] <lizmat> jnthn: maybe calling .WHICH should move an object from the nursery and then give it a fixed .WHICH value stored in a slightly larger header ?

[22:23] <jnthn> lizmat: Moving an object from the nursery means doing GC, which is gonna get costly on every WHICH. ;)

[22:23] <jnthn> lizmat: But that is along the right lines.

[22:23] <jnthn> lizmat: ONce an object reaches gen2 it actually doesn't move.

[22:24] <lizmat> maybe each thread needs it's own gen1.5 ?

[22:24] <lizmat> for those objects we call .WHICH on ?

[22:24] <jnthn> Object refs can be shared over threads :)

[22:24] <lizmat> true  :-(

[22:24] <jnthn> Anyway, my idea was that if an object is in gen2 already, use the memory address

[22:25] <lizmat> yup

[22:25] <lizmat> also: if calling .WHICH would trigger a GC, we potentially could have a lot more GC runs

[22:25] <lizmat> but they would be smaller ?

[22:25] <jnthn> And if it's not, then reserve a gen2 address for it, and make an entry in a hash table of nursery address => gen2 address

[22:26] <jnthn> And then look in that table when upgrading or sweeping objects.

[22:26] <jnthn> GC runs carry a fixed overhead

[22:26] <lizmat> well, hash and threads, sounds dangerous

[22:26] <jnthn> As well as the "how many"

[22:26] <jnthn> So protect the hash (in fact, the whole WHICH process for non-gen2 objects) with a mutex :)

[22:27] <lizmat> ok, but that screams deadlock to me

[22:27] <jnthn> Deadlock relies on being able to construct a circular wait.

[22:27] <jnthn> So long as we don't do anything that could lock while holding the lock, we're good. And in this case we quite easily cna.

[22:27] <jnthn> *can

[22:27] <lizmat> two threads calling .WHICH on the same thing at the same time ?

[22:28] <jnthn> One gets the lock first, sees it's nursery and needs a stable address, and so allocates it one, and makes the hash entry. Releases the lock.

[22:28] <lizmat> well, you have more experience in that  :-)

[22:28] <lizmat> yup, ok feels like doable  :-)

[22:28] <jnthn> Second thread then gets the lock, sees it's nursery, sees we already made it an entyr in the hash table, grabs it, releases the lock, and done.

[22:29] <jnthn> *entry

[22:29] <lizmat> indeed

[22:31] <jnthn> When I teach on deadlock I typically end up talking about the aggregate pattern as a decent structure that can avoid circular waiting arising.

[22:32] <jnthn> Turns out you can spend days talking about the aggregate pattern too, though... :)

[22:40] <lizmat> :-)

[22:42] <lizmat> I guess we would need some code for the case that .WHICH gets called on something in the nursery, but it gets abandoned before a GC happens

[22:42] <lizmat> so the reservation in gen2 would need to be undone

[22:43] <lizmat> or always move it to gen2 (even though it should be reaped already) and leave it to the gen2 GC run ?

[22:43] <jnthn> Well, the GC sweeper could just clear up the entry in the table and add the gen2 slot into the free list

[22:44] <lizmat> indeed, but we shouldn't forget that  :-)

[22:44] <jnthn> Indeed :)
