[14:06] <timotimo> i'd like there to be some way for an embedder of moarvm to expose functions hassle-free that get the whole moarvm-internals-stuff, like a ThreadContext and MVMObjects

[14:06] <timotimo> so kind of like extops, but more like NativeCall

[14:13] <brrt> hi folks... is there a moarvm mailing list anywhere, where i can send longer-form questions and thoughts?

[14:14] <timotimo> hm. i don't think so

[14:14] <timotimo> maybe the github issues tracker would be an acceptable substitute for the time being?

[14:14] <brrt> ok, fair enought

[14:14] <brrt> enough

[14:14] <brrt> pff

[14:15] <timotimo> :)

[16:05] <jnthn> timotimo: We basically don't have an embedding API yet.

[16:05] <timotimo> oh, you want to specify something stable and stuff?

[16:06] <jnthn> At some point we probably should do that, yeah.

[16:06] <nwc10> most curious, I was just typing into my file of notes about that

[16:06] <jnthn> Though it's probably good if it's use-case driven.

[16:06] <timotimo> i was under the impression that MVM_vm_create_instance and friends are good enough :P

[16:08] <jnthn> Well, they may well be part of it.

[16:08] <jnthn> But we don't have an ideal way to do what you just asked for, for example.

[16:08] <timotimo> right.

[16:13] <jnthn> Easy trip to Oslo was easy... Nice and cool up here too :)

[16:33] *** woolfy left
[16:40] <timotimo> the current use-case i'm thinking of is having a Rakudo::Debugger frontend that talks to a process that embeds MoarVM

[16:40] <timotimo> for example via a queue

[16:40] <timotimo> but the queue would have to be made known to the embedding process in some way

[16:41] <timotimo> and NativeCall doesn't support passing around things with reprs that don't start with C

[16:41] <timotimo> though that gives me an idea

[16:41] <timotimo> isn't the repr for the queue "ConcurrentSomethingQueue"?

[16:41] <timotimo> starts with C, too!
