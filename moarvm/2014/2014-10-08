[19:55] <jnthn> so logo!

[19:59] <nwc10> much roar

[20:00] <jnthn> nmake

[20:00] <jnthn> gah

[20:00] <japhb> No Makefile found.

[20:01] * japhb is sitting in airport, discovering the lag of crappy cell service

[20:01] <jnthn> Better the lag than the lack...

[20:01] <japhb> *re-discovering, actually

[20:01] <japhb> Truedat

[20:01] <jnthn> japhb: When're you getting in?

[20:01] <jnthn> What route?

[20:02] <japhb> I think I share the FRA -> SZG leg with you.

[20:02] * jnthn discovered he and Pm accidentally have the same last leg

[20:02] <jnthn> haha :D

[20:02] <jnthn> d'oh!

[20:03] <jnthn> ...at least that wasn't something secret :)

[20:03] <japhb> Yeah, I've had some scares like that.  Where you break out in a cold sweat while reading the backscroll you just produced.

[20:04] <japhb> Thankfully I don't think I've ever done it with something truly secret (ccrossing find^Hgers)

[20:04] <japhb> Internet: BE FASTER

[20:06] <nwc10> japhb: isn't this why we have offline version control systems, etc?

[20:07] <japhb> nwc10: I am using a work laptop as essentially a dumb terminal.  So I basically can't do much on here without network access.

[20:10] <japhb> Some day when I have a personal laptop that can compile rakudo on all backends and still do anything else, I'll be back to using local CP

[20:10] <japhb> CPU again.  :-)

[20:10] <timotimo> jnthn: so you're working on EXPORTHOW a bit more? :)

[20:11] <jnthn> ...maaaaybe :P

[20:28] <jnthn> japhb: Have a good flight!

[20:29] <japhb> Thanks, jnthn!  :-)

[20:30] * japhb is meanwhile attempting to golf an occasional segfault/crash from a 1250 line Perl 6 script.  Wheeeee ...

[20:30] <japhb> It's the occasional that's driving me mad.
