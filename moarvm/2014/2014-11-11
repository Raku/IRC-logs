[10:52] <FROGGS> nwc10: my first show stopper for maorvm on hp-ux is that dyncall does not support hp-ux :o(

[10:53] <nwc10> that would be a bit of a bother

[10:55] <jnthn> Dependencies. Screwed if you do, screwed if you don't. :)

[10:56] <FROGGS> hppa is on their todo on place #9 of missing implementations (there are several other todo list topics)

[11:03] <nwc10> my rough conclusion was that the easiest way forward was to make the MoarVM code portable between either dyncall or libffi (but not bundling libffi)

[11:04] <jnthn> Can probe for a system one, I guess...

[11:05] <jnthn> But yeah, that may be a way

[22:07] <brrt> \o

[22:07] <FROGGS> o/

[22:07] <brrt> i'm going to be as useful as i have been for weeks and hand in a bugreport

[22:08] <FROGGS> :P

[22:08] <brrt> nqp::shell() hangs for me (moarvm geba41f9, nqp-m gee2ca3a), any old command, linux 3.16.7 64 bit

[22:09] <brrt> know of it?

[22:09] <FROGGS> no

[22:09] <FROGGS> we've not touched shell lately

[22:10] <brrt> probably a libuv issue

[22:11] <brrt> let me try and repeat that with a bit cleaner build

[22:12] <brrt> git submodule, how the world loath thee

[22:17] <brrt> it was my unclean build apparantly

[22:18] <brrt> nothing to see here :-) see you tomorrow

[22:19] <FROGGS> :o)

[22:19] <japhb> brrt: The whole Rakudo stack has a long history of being unhappy with unclean builds ....
