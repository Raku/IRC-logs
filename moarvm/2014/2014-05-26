[09:49] <nwc10> currently is peak memory usage for the build during setting compilation?

[09:49] <nwc10> and how big is it?

[09:49] <nwc10> (roughly)

[09:49] <nwc10> and is there a good way to get the GC to tell us how much memory (total) is in allocated objects?

[09:49] <nwc10> (ie the sum of the ->size, not the bits that dangle off)

[10:21] <timotimo> the moar-gdb.py tool ha something for that

[10:22] <timotimo> for the gen2 it only samples a portion of all objects, but you can set the sample count up to get more

[10:24] <timotimo> nwc10: for an rm CORE.setting.moarvm and then time make m-install i get: 54.67user 0.46system 0:56.90elapsed 96%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 744776maxresident)k

[10:24] <timotimo> that still seems like a lot to me

[10:25] <nwc10> Thanks, that's still a somewhat useful number
