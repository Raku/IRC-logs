[00:59] <japhb_> Dangit, can we just get yoleaux in here?  Does anyone object?

[01:00] <japhb_> I'd like to be able to get .tell ...

[01:00] <japhb_> ... and convince brrt to get a VM somewhere stable that he can stay connected.  :-)

[01:03] <timotimo> i'm pretty sure he backlogs, though

[01:25] <japhb_> timotimo, OK, roger that.

[01:26] <japhb_> brrt: Can you tell me any particular things you'd like me to add tests for first, so I can prioritize?

[18:24] <tadzik> yes

[18:25] <tadzik> well, it's available for Perl 6 developers

[18:25] <tadzik> I'm pretty sure 99% of the usage is IRC :)

[19:12] <brrt> japhb: i don't really care for what code, as long as it is a bit 'realistic'

[19:12] <brrt> right now i use specially-designed subs of which I know how they are compiled

[19:13] <brrt> ultimately we want to find the blockers in 'real' code

[19:13] <brrt> jnthn: ping

[19:13] <japhb> brrt: Fair enough.

[19:13] <japhb> BTW, do you backlog?

[19:14] <japhb> (as a habit, I mean)

[19:14] <japhb> You might want to just get an account on feather so you can leave an irssi inside a screen connected 24/7 ....

[19:15] <brrt> aye, i always backlog

[19:15] *** japhb_ joined
[19:15] <brrt> except when i don't

[19:15] <brrt> :-)

[19:15] <japhb> ... and therein lies the rub.  :-)

[19:15] <brrt> well, it's very rare, tbh

[19:16] <brrt> but i suppose you're right

[19:17] <timotimo> congrats, brrt

[19:18] <brrt> oh, yes

[19:18] <brrt> thanks timotimo :-)

[19:19] <brrt> that's what i was here to ask about, a 'performance review' of sorts

[19:19] <brrt> or rather

[19:19] <brrt> how can i do better

[19:20] <timotimo> i want to constantly monitor your progress extremely closely! :P

[19:24] <brrt> well, i'll commit every line separately then :-p

[19:25] <timotimo> :P

[19:25] <timotimo> you could stream your work to justin.tv with obs-studio :P

[19:25] <timotimo> j/k

[19:25] <brrt> obs-studio?

[19:25] <brrt> open broadcast studio

[19:26] <brrt> lol

[19:26] <brrt> you'd be scared of my 2048 scores, so better not

[19:54] * TimToady refrains from mentioning there's a 2048 task on RC

[19:55] * brrt doesn't know what RC is

[19:55] <brrt> oh

[19:55] <brrt> rosetta-code

[19:55] <brrt> what is the task?

[19:55] <brrt> no, never mind

[19:55] <brrt> jit is the priority

[19:56] <TimToady> that's why I didn't mention it :)

[19:58] <masak> 2048 doesn't seem to have any effect on my focus. :)

[19:59] <masak> maybe it's too sudoku-like.

[20:00] <brrt> 2048 doesn't have an effect on mine anymore, either

[20:00] <brrt> because... i blocked it

[20:00] <FROGGS> :P

[20:00] <brrt> hostfile editing ftw

[20:00] <brrt> :-P

[20:02] * brrt restarting, brb

[20:04] <FROGGS> why would one do that? O.o

[20:07] <masak> do what? restart?

[20:14] <FROGGS> yeah...

[20:14] <FROGGS> my laptop is on for weeks usually...

[20:20] *** japhb_ joined
[20:32] <japhb_> FROGGS, I can usually go a few weeks to a few months between reboots, but inevitably there's a fix in something that won't reload without a reboot, and then I get to lose all my happy happy state ...

[21:49] <masak> this paper looks vaguely interesting for #moarvm: http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/iacoma-papers/pldi14.pdf

[22:12] <TimToady_> I do think we make more guarantees about what can be finalized and CHECK and/or FINAL time

[22:12] <TimToady_> not that we exactly implement FINAL yet...
