[16:35] <dalek> MoarVM: replace $(PREFIX) by @prefix@ which will result in a path string

[16:35] <dalek> MoarVM:

[16:35] <dalek> MoarVM: So we don't end up with '$(PREFIX)' in flags exposed to perl6, which will

[16:35] <dalek> MoarVM: not be resolvable at that point anymore.

[21:06] <dalek> MoarVM:

[21:06] <dalek> MoarVM: This will be used in timers, async I/O, file system notifications, and

[21:06] <dalek> MoarVM: so forth. It will deliver completion notifications into a queue - one

[21:06] <dalek> MoarVM: that is presumably being used as a thread pool input stream.
