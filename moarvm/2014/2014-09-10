[10:25] <jnthn> FROGGS: I appear to use a User/Token/Domain to do that

[10:25] <nwc10> good UGT heresy, jnthn

[10:26] <jnthn> s/use/need/

[10:26] <jnthn> o/ nwc10

[10:26] <FROGGS> jnthn: just leave 'em blank

[10:27] <FROGGS> and toggle the activate checkbox at the bottom

[10:28] <jnthn> FROGGS: OK, done

[10:29] <FROGGS> <FROGGS> jnthn: and then please put the switch to 'on' here: https://travis-ci.org/profile/MoarVM

[10:29] <FROGGS> jnthn: you also did that?

[10:30] <nwc10> links https://travis-ci.org/

[10:30] <nwc10> :-(

[10:30] <jnthn> If it ever finishes loading... :/

[10:30] <jnthn> Stupid Chinese internet

[10:30] <nwc10> I wonder if that breaks the law in the US

[10:30] <FROGGS> I see it immediately here

[10:31] <FROGGS> nwc10: why?

[10:31] <jnthn> Well, the page comes up, then there's osme "Loading" thingy that just doesn't go away

[10:31] <nwc10> disability laws

[10:31] <jnthn> Which is where it should show me the switch I guess

[10:31] <nwc10> it's really not accessible

[10:32] <jnthn> ah, ok, now it works

[10:32] <jnthn> Flicked the thing on.

[10:32] <jnthn> shower &&

[10:32] <FROGGS> jnthn++

[10:33] <nwc10> also, where does travis tell me what architectures it builds on?

[10:38] <FROGGS> nwc10: one can dump extra information by putting stuff in .travis.yml

[10:38] <FROGGS> currently it only runs on linux x86_64

[10:39] <FROGGS> they theoretically have an osx farm, but they are out of capacity so you cannot request space on these boxes

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM: 8f916f7 | (Tobias Leich)++ | Configure.pl:

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM: add dot of sentence in Configure.pl --help

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8f916f745e

[10:41] <FROGGS> https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/builds/34899506

[10:41] <FROGGS> it will build four versions: with jit and gcc, with gcc, with jit and clang, with clang

[10:42] <nwc10> FROGGS: is it possible to also configure it to do an ASAN build?

[10:42] <nwc10> that's a bit "advanced", but might be really useful

[10:42] <FROGGS> nwc10: that should work, yes

[10:42] <nwc10> realistically, that's most useful for the end-to-end, once rakudo is there (and building NQP and MoarVM as pre-reqs)

[10:43] <FROGGS> we can also apt-get libtommath and use that one in one of the builds

[10:44] <FROGGS> nwc10: rakudo and nqp is there

[10:44] <FROGGS> are*

[10:44] <nwc10> oh right. things that I did not know

[10:45] <FROGGS> the gcc builds passed already, clang is still ongoing

[14:55] <leedo> FROGGS: trying out libuv-upgrade branch with latest rakudo

[14:55] <leedo> on OS X

[14:56] <FROGGS> leedo: ohh! thank you!

[14:56] <FROGGS> it is possible that I get an osx box by tomorrow, in case it still does not work

[15:01] <leedo> it seems to still hang here

[15:01] <jnthn> FROGGS: Did you end up changing something in Moar, or something in libuv?

[15:01] <FROGGS> jnthn: neither

[15:02] <jnthn> ah

[15:02] <FROGGS> leedo: thanks

[15:02] <FROGGS> jnthn: there was a circularity in rakudo's setting

[15:03] <FROGGS> leedo: and it again hangs when building RESTRICTED.setting?

[15:03] <jnthn> Ah, OK...

[15:03] <leedo> FROGGS: yep

[15:04] <FROGGS> okay, then it is at least consistent

[15:04] <leedo> i did realclean, and the libuv repo looks like the correct revision

[15:04] <FROGGS> okay, then I really need an osx box :o)

[15:05] <FROGGS> btw, this libuv version will become version 1.0 soonish

[15:05] * jnthn hopes it'll be fixed - provided it is their bug - beforehand...

[15:06] <leedo> FROGGS: i can maybe get you access to a mac mini in my living room :P

[15:07] <FROGGS> *g*

[15:07] <FROGGS> leedo: that'd be sweet :o)

[15:08] <leedo> of course they make it as hard as possible to add users from the command line

[15:09] <FROGGS> jnthn: we just need a proper test case, or a bisected commit or some such

[15:10] <jnthn> OK

[15:11] <jnthn> FROGGS++ and leedo++ for looking into it :)

[15:11] <nwc10> leedo: bring it to the hackathon: http://act.useperl.at/apw2014/talk/5565

[15:13] <leedo> i wish i could! pretty well stuck here in Detroit

[15:13] <leedo> but i can open ssh up at least

[15:43] <jnthn> ooh, I should book my hackathon flights in not too long

[17:36] <brrt> \o

[17:37] <brrt> backlogging &

[17:40] <brrt> ugh, libuv still sucky? the nodejs folks are using that too, right

[17:42] <diakopter> well, they originated it

[17:46] <leedo> brrt: yeah, FROGGS is investigating further

[17:46] <leedo> he has an OS X login now though

[17:47] <brrt> yay

[17:48] <brrt> (I have an OS X login at $dayjob. problem is, i'm not there that often, and i'm supposed to do 'real' work)

[17:52] <brrt> node.js folks were very helpful, but they don't maintain it. i'm asking in the specific channel right now

[17:55] <brrt> let us take a small moment to appreciate the major suck that is the inability to run os x on anything other than apple hardware

[17:55] <brrt> i.e. had we had a vmware image we'd have fixed this by now

[17:58] <brrt> even microsoft (especially microsoft) is incredibly cool in the way they allow you to run an 'evaluation' ISO

[17:58] <japhb> brrt: But nothing that helps us solve problems more quickly *makes Apple more money*, so that will never happen

[17:59] <brrt> which is... painful, right?

[17:59] <japhb> Yes, for everyone except the people in Cupertino building a space ship to fill with the billions of dollars of cash they have on hand

[18:01] <japhb> On the flip side, if I had my choice of OS to put on Mac hardware, it would really, really not be OS X.

[18:01] <brrt> what would it be, i'm interested :-)

[18:02] <leedo> japhb: my problem is that i really like the apple hardware

[18:02] <leedo> i'd rather be running linux + a tiling wm though

[18:03] <brrt> that can be arranged :-)

[18:04] * brrt has an asus and is nothing but very happy about it

[18:04] <diakopter> well it also forces software developers to default to using Macs

[18:04] <diakopter> so they don't need multiple notebooks

[18:04] <brrt> that, or ignore mac

[18:08] <diakopter> right, those people aren't targeting the 17.2% of internet users who use mac/ios http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201408-201408-bar

[18:11] <diakopter> but if you work at a company that makes software products to sell, webapps to sell, or mobile apps to sell, you'll test on macs/ios

[18:12] <diakopter> in North America it's 30%

[18:12] <brrt> maybe. it's still annoying that apple can extract this kind of tax even though they have - in real world terms - hardly any users

[18:12] <brrt> yeah, and the rest of the world?

[18:13] <brrt> and again. microsoft is many times larger, and non-annoying about this

[18:13] <diakopter> less than 17%?

[18:13] <leedo> yeah 30% of our website's total traffic is iOS or OS X, so it is hard to ignore

[18:13] <diakopter> Europe is 17%

[18:14] <brrt> i may be in an overly grumpy mood over this, but imagine this

[18:15] <diakopter> Asia is 7% and Mac doesn't even beat "Unkown" and "Other"

[18:15] <brrt> star trek style future has happened, and we are on a first interplanetary mission using our first warp drive

[18:15] <brrt> 70 people are on board

[18:15] <diakopter> woo

[18:15] <diakopter> oh, thought you said missle

[18:16] <leedo> the federation would never do that!

[18:16] <brrt> what do you think the distribution of people looks like if it is taken completely uniformly from our current population?

[18:16] <diakopter> well, starfleet only accepts the best of the best

[18:17] <diakopter> plus Reginald Barclay

[18:17] <brrt> lol

[18:17] <leedo> hey reggie was pretty smart

[18:17] <leedo> just socially inept

[18:18] <brrt> anyway, to run the numbers

[18:18] <diakopter> yeah when he told the holodeck he could tell it how to build a better brain-ship interface, and then did it

[18:19] <diakopter> I'm pretty sure Starfleet would mandate only Starfleet-approved software at that point. certified systems and all.

[18:19] <brrt> 3 north americans, 3 europeans, 2 russians, 10-11 indians, 10 or so chinese

[18:19] <brrt> i think about 5 indonesians? maybe one australian, 2 japanese or so

[18:19] <brrt> i.e. about 1,5 persons of those 70 would have had an iphone

[18:20] <brrt> i'm not sure, they let the bynars get away with a lot

[18:20] <diakopter> good point.

[18:21] <diakopter> "It is a great pleasure.." "..to work on such a large mobile computer."

[18:22] * brrt thought they were awesome

[18:22] <brrt> fwiw, my moodiness stems from a counterreaction to the insane amount of hype, also 6 hours of lectures

[19:53] <FROGGS> jnthn: I think I know a little bit moar about our libuv problem

[19:53] <FROGGS> jnthn: first when we slurp we start the RESTRICTED.pm (866 bytes), and slurp that via syncfile.c

[19:54] <FROGGS> jnthn: then we are done on linux, but on osx we try to slurp it *again* as a syncstream

[19:56] *** ggoebel1111114 joined
[19:58] <FROGGS> jnthn: yeah, for the first slurp the handle->body.ops->lockable has a value and for the second it is NULL

[20:25] <leedo> http://prettybrd.com/~leedo/b/screenshots/20140910-042528PM.png

[20:27] <FROGGS> leedo: exactly, it is spawning that process, and then infiniloops somewhere in libuv when reading its output

[20:27] <FROGGS> it calls uv_read_start, which should call an on_read callback

[20:27] <FROGGS> that happens on my linux box, but not on osx

[20:30] <lizmat> I take it, it is too early to give the --gen-moar=upgrade-libuv a spin ?
