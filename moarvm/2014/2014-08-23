[00:05] <timotimo> we may get a noticable speed boost if we have the string constants start and end with " inside moarvm's C code that generates the datastructure :)

[05:28] <tadzik> hmm, so you do have to be in the nqp directory or not?

[05:28] <tadzik> when profiling

[05:40] *** woosley joined
[05:47] <TimToady> no, I just ran one in the spec directory

[05:47] <TimToady> er, perl-bench

[06:46] *** woosley joined
[07:00] <tadzik> hmm

[07:41] <jnthn> tadzik: In the very first code I pushed you did; then I pushed some stuff so it installs the template and looks it up from the install location.

[07:41] <tadzik> jnthn: okay, I got it working now :)

[07:43] <tadzik> jnthn: hmm. If I sum up all times in call_graph, plus all times in gcs, plus spesh_time, I don't end up with total_time. Did I forget about something?

[07:44] <jnthn> tadzik: You summed up exclusive times, I'm assuming?

[07:44] <tadzik> jnthn: correct

[07:44] <tadzik> jnthn: the sum is lower

[07:44] <tadzik> 16461692 vs 17314798 of total_time

[07:44] <jnthn> A little lower, or a lot lower?

[07:45] <tadzik> so about 5% is lost

[07:45] <tadzik> profiler overhead?

[07:46] <jnthn> I think it's more that it doesn't calculate the total_time at the point we drop out of the last profiled call frame since we started, but rather at the point we are asked for the profile data.

[07:47] <tadzik> close enough :)

[07:48] <jnthn> I can probably do something about that, but need to worry about preparing my async talk some more first...

[07:48] <tadzik> don't worry about it :)

[07:48] <tadzik> if my end results ends up looking blatantly wrong, I'll get back to you

[07:49] <tadzik> if it doesn't, I'll still get back to you though :P

[07:50] <tadzik> jnthn: also, I noticed that things like lib/NativeCall.pm6.moarvm:-1 show up

[07:50] <tadzik> how does that happen?

[07:50] <jnthn> That means "unknown line number"

[07:51] <jnthn> The UI I wrote turns that into <unknown>

[07:51] <jnthn> Ofter it is due to compiler-genreated fames, like the deserialization or load-time frame.

[07:51] <tadzik> right, but why is both NativeCall.pm6 and NativeCall.pm6.moarvm... oh, I see

[07:54] <jnthn> It fails to find the HLL filename and falls back to the VM one, iirc
