[12:23] <diakopter> interesting; instrumented/debug build of moar.dll,moar.exe,perl6_ops_moar.dll run the parse stage 4% faster than non-instrumented/debug

[12:25] <brrt> o.O

[12:26] <brrt> consistently?

[12:26] <brrt> although 4% is far below the usual variation in stage-parse-time on my machines

[12:27] <lizmat> does it spectest ok?

[12:27] <diakopter> oh

[15:41] <hoelzro> so I found a really "fun" precomp bug over the weekend: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/142

[15:42] <hoelzro> I'm guessing that what's happening is that the Example namespace is loaded in the first module, so the lazy loader think it doesn't have any more work to do

[20:09] <timotimo> o/

[20:10] <brrt> was your shirt too large or too small :-)

[20:15] <timotimo> let's investigate the evidence

[20:16] <timotimo> the shirt was produced in america, but i forgot to correct the size i ordered for that fact

[20:22] *** kjs_ joined
[20:26] <brrt> americans are not very large? (dutch perspective)

[20:26] <brrt> but they are ehm.... heavy, on averge

[20:26] <brrt> average

[20:27] <brrt> i think it's probably too large

[20:29] <lizmat> brrt: don't worry, once you get older you will fill it and blame it on having it washed too hot  :-)

[20:30] * brrt has had a very stable weight for the last 10 years though :-)

[20:30] <brrt> also, mine fits

[20:30] <brrt> (for now)

[20:35] <lizmat> :-)  be happy!

[20:36] <brrt> i am :-)

[22:09] <brrt> i'm going to sleep now
