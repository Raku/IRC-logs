[21:56] <[Coke]> there we go. feel free to fix that test if needed.

[21:56] <[Coke]> ww.

[21:56] <TimToady> gah, just found that getuniprop_int and getuniprop_bool are cross-wired

[21:56] <timotimo> mhhh tasty copypesto

[21:57] <FROGGS> TimToady: I've seen a commit in MoarVM where you switched them

[21:58] <TimToady> yeah, was trying stuff out, and didn't reverse everything

[21:58] <timotimo> ... reverse engineering done right ...

[22:53] <dalek> MoarVM: add "missing" entry for Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph

[22:53] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8b55966495

[22:53] <TimToady> bmg was finding ) because it was the 0'th entry in the enum, so I added a '' entry before it

[22:54] <timotimo> ah!

[22:54] <timotimo> that'd explain it

[22:54] <TimToady> the revert was because I added null entries to other categories, then realized they had natural "no entry" entries already

[22:55] <timotimo> is there also a "upside down glyph" property? ;)

[22:55] <TimToady> the enums that return lists of hexcode might usefully be preprocessed into the actual characters, I suppose

[22:55] <TimToady> .u turned

[22:55] <TimToady> well, that's turned, not inverted

[22:55] <timotimo> i know about the codepoints that have those; are they linked to the "originals"?

[22:56] * timotimo looks at wikipedia

[22:57] <TimToady> only to their case equivs, looks like

[22:57] <timotimo> i don't have the right article, i just found out :|
