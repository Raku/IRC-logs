[00:01] <timotimo> er ... oops?

[00:02] <FROGGS_> timotimo: 1 if <[a]> gives that too

[00:02] <FROGGS_> timotimo: 1 if /<[a]>/ <-- this

[00:03] <timotimo> maybe it's my debug output

[00:05] <FROGGS_> inline if?

[00:05] <timotimo> yeah

[00:05] <timotimo> er, i mean

[00:06] <timotimo> $left := $other if $other < $left

[00:06] <timotimo> my replacement for the min call

[00:07] <FROGGS_> that is likely

[00:07] <timotimo> very weird, it explodes right in the middle of everything

[00:07] <timotimo> ah, i think i may know what's wrong

[00:08] <grondilu> uv__loop_delete: Assertion `!((((*(&(loop)->active_reqs))[0]) == (&(loop)->active_reqs)) == 0)' failed.

[00:08] <timotimo> that always happens if we've outputted something to stderr

[00:08] <FROGGS_> ahh

[00:08] <FROGGS_> 1 if /<[a]>/ only explodes because $_ is Mu or something

[00:08] <timotimo> mhm

[00:12] * grondilu makes a manual pull in ./nqp/MoarVM

[00:16] <[Coke]> --gen-nqp=master --gen-moar=master

[00:16] <[Coke]> (at least until we get our version #'s fixed up)

[00:17] <grondilu> I tried that, but I got the failed assertion above

[00:32] * timotimo gets a newer nqp and hopes that changes something

[00:32] <timotimo> but not much changed in between :(

[00:35] * grondilu tries 'rm -rf install nqp' and Configure.pl again

[01:24] * grondilu watches the compilation tackling m-CORE.settings

[01:27] <lue> grondilu: just so you know, if you get a segfault at the end of the m-CORE.setting step, you should try running 'make' one or two more times.

[01:28] <grondilu> ok

[01:29] <grondilu> what does the numbers at each stage mean, already?

[01:29] <grondilu> for instance:  Stage parse      : 455.780

[01:30] <lue> How long it took that stage to happen, in seconds.

[01:31] <grondilu> oh yeah I could have guessed that

[01:37] <grondilu> wow, compilation has ended with no error

[01:37] <grondilu> ./perl6-m -e 'say "hi";'

[01:37] <grondilu> hi

[01:37] <grondilu> \o/

[01:37] <grondilu> well done, guys!

[01:38] <JimmyZ> \o

[01:51] * grondilu runs make spectest

[01:58] * grondilu gladly notices that rakudo counts from 1 to 100 on moar faster than on parrot

[01:59] <grondilu> it's funny though, when I run:

[01:59] <grondilu> time ./perl6-m -e '.say for 1 .. 100;'

[01:59] <grondilu> I got a segfault at the end

[02:00] <grondilu> but not when I run:

[02:00] <grondilu> time ./perl6-m -e '.say for 1 .. 99;'

[02:00] <grondilu> neither when I run:

[02:00] <grondilu> ./perl6-m -e '.say for 1 .. 100;'

[02:01] <grondilu> hum, it's actually not faster, I spoke too fast.

[02:02] * diakopter is sad that it's even measurable in any backend

[02:23] <lue> Running perl6-m -v gets me the version info, but perl6-m -e 'say 42' gets me "Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/QRegex.nqp'" :|

[19:33] <FROGGS> what is wrong with Nil?

[19:34] <FROGGS> ahh

[19:34] <FROGGS> this should happen:

[19:34] <FROGGS> Cannot call 'match'; none of these signatures match:

[19:50] <nwc10> jnthn: sorry for delay - 80a4be01d5 cherry picked atop my local torture and debugging hacks "passes"

[19:50] <nwc10> by inspection, it doesn't seem to add or remove any allocations, so that implies that the GC runs will happen at exactly the same places, which in turn implies that it does fix the mark issue

[19:52] <nwc10> likely to be some delay in rebasing my torture code onto current HEAD, and having a re-run

[20:36] <dalek> MoarVM: 57de493 | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/io/fileops.c:

[20:36] <dalek> MoarVM: die when attempting to print a NULL string

[20:36] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/57de493f43

[20:39] <[Coke]> FROGGS: should that have been inside a conditional?

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM: actually check for string being NULL, [Coke]++

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0b69366238

[20:42] <FROGGS> [Coke]: but my test worked :o)

[21:01] <nwc10> timotimo: Perl 5's sort may actually be fractionally better than timsort. See http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2013/09/msg207355.html

[21:04] <lue> I assume "Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/QRegex.nqp'" is a bug I'll need to wait for being fixed, right?

[21:05] <[Coke]> lue: I'm not seeing that on my daily builds. What's the scenario to reproduce?

[21:05] <FROGGS> I don't have that either

[21:05] <[Coke]> do we want moarvm tickets on RT or on github?

[21:05] <lue> Install to /usr/local, try running outside the git repo :) [this was from last night; maybe it changed?]

[21:06] <FROGGS> lue: that might be a problem

[21:06] <FROGGS> can you run from inside the repo?

[21:07] <FROGGS> I had to revert a path that made it wortk outside the repo for me, but there was a pitfall I seemed to jump over some how

[21:07] <lue> FROGGS: yes, it does work inside.  perl6-m -v  works outside the repo however.

[21:08] <FROGGS> the -v does almomst nothing, it does not load any module for example

[21:16] <lue> FROGGS: I could imagine, just thought I'd mention that something on perl6-m works outside the repo :)

[21:17] <FROGGS> yeah... I will make that work some day but this will take a few hours

[21:23] <lue> Don't worry too much about it, I'm not desperate.
