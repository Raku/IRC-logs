[12:48] <brrt> hi #moarvm

[12:48] <timotimo> hey brrt!

[12:48] <timotimo> nice to see you again :)

[12:48] <brrt> :-)

[12:49] <timotimo> i was recently quite surprised to see that the midterm evaluations are almost just around the corner

[12:49] <brrt> i should've been here a bit more, shouldn't i

[12:49] <brrt> really?

[12:49] <brrt> :-o

[12:49] <brrt> ow

[12:49] <timotimo> 4 weeks

[12:49] <timotimo> my perception of time is ... interesting :)

[12:49] <brrt> i've been preoccupied by finishing my 'research course'

[12:49] <brrt> well, 4 weeks is fast, i grant you that

[12:49] <timotimo> that's probably all right

[12:51] <brrt> how's moarvm been?

[12:54] <[Coke]> https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-lwp-simple/issues/30

[13:02] <brrt> oh

[13:08] <brrt> i kind of need to get myself a new computer

[13:09] <FROGGS> famous last words *g*

[13:12] <brrt> well, or continue working on an 2010 eee pc

[13:12] <timotimo> oh, ouch :)

[13:14] <brrt> it works

[13:14] <brrt> acceptably

[13:15] <brrt> but newer would probably be better :-)

[13:18] * timotimo hasn't been putting work into moarvm recently :(

[13:18] <FROGGS> heh, that seems like you will be your best user when the JIT is going in :o)

[13:18] <FROGGS> timotimo: me neither

[13:18] <brrt> my personal, non-public aim is: an mp3 player in perl6

[13:18] <brrt> ought to be doable, right?

[13:20] <brrt> /me afk

[13:21] <timotimo> depends on whether or not you want to do the decoding in pure perl6 :)

[18:26] <brrt> if its not in perl6, why bother :-)

[18:32] <lizmat> feels to me that that would be an excellent JIT opportunity !

[18:32] <lizmat> and if that works, why stick to mp3, why not go mp4 all the way  :-)

[18:32] <TimToady> or mp5 even

[18:33] <brrt> mp5 isn't a thing, is it?

[18:33] <tadzik> in military it is

[18:34] <lizmat> we used to have S5 in the Dutch military

[18:34] <lizmat> it meant you would qualify as a Perl programmer

[18:35] <brrt> seriously? i'm amazed

[18:35] <TimToady> brrt: it isn't a think YET!  you need to invent it...

[18:35] <brrt> the dutch military trained perl programmer?

[18:35] <brrt> s

[18:35] <TimToady> *ing

[18:36] <brrt> :-) the name will be claimed soon enough i think

[18:36] <brrt> maybe for the h265 codec

[18:36] <lizmat> brrt: S1 meant you were mentally very stable...  :-)

[18:36] <brrt> oh i see

[18:36] <brrt> :-D

[18:36] <brrt> weird

[18:37] <TimToady> the ones you put on your nuclear subs, eh?

[18:37] <brrt> the dutch military emphatically does not have nuclear subs

[18:37] <brrt> couldn't pay for it if they wanted, probably

[18:37] <TimToady> yes, but it's still true that all your nuclear subs are staffed by S1

[18:38] <TimToady> s/your/their/ as necessary

[18:38] <TimToady> but you do have a .nl address

[18:39] <brrt> i'm dutch, yes :-)

[18:42] <brrt> TimToady - not according to classic syllogistics, because the term 'all dutch nuclear submarines' is empty :-)

[19:29] <brrt> question - why are operations like goto, if, unless, etc. in MoarVM gc sync points?

[19:35] <lizmat> because they (can) enter new scopes ?

[19:52] <brrt> i guess

[19:53] <brrt> can i take the moment to show my appreciation for the code quality in moarvm?

[19:53] <lizmat> jnthn would know for sure, but he's on Quality Time with his family, afaik

[19:53] <brrt> well, thats a good idea for everyone, of course :-)

[19:53] <lizmat> glad to hear you like the code quality  :-)

[19:54] <lizmat> .oO( haven't added / changed a single byte in that repo, afaik )

[19:54] <lizmat> looking forward to seeing some high quality code being added :-)

[19:54] <brrt> huh, can't promise high quality on the first run

[19:54] <brrt> :-)

[19:59] <brrt> although one can postpone merging until quality is good enough

[19:59] <lizmat> I think the only way to find out about the quality, is to do it in HEAD

[20:00] <lizmat> only when you increment MOAR_VERSION in nqp, and NQP_VERSION in rakudo, will Perl 6 actually see what you're doing

[20:00] <lizmat> and the sooner we find out about problems, the better

[20:01] <brrt> thats true

[20:01] <brrt> i'm not yet sure about how to represent JIT-ed code and how to explicitly test for it

[20:02] <brrt> short of entering puts("ENTERING JIT...") in every routine

[20:05] <lizmat> macro?

[20:06] <brrt> hmm yes

[20:07] <brrt> i still want to figure out exactly how to access structs with dynasm

[20:15] <brrt> afk, see you tomorrow

[20:15] <lizmat> brrt: sorry, can't help you with that.  maybe nwc10 can?

[20:15] <brrt> i'll ask arround :-)

[20:15] <brrt> thanks
