[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: 3ba2676 | jnthn++ | src/io/syncpipe.c:

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: Avoid a use-after-free.

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM:

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: This was a bug on all platforms, but it seems that OSX delivers events

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: with timing that exposes the bug. Hopefully deals with the qqx crashes

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: on OSX.

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3ba267630d

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: 5f9e2d0 | jnthn++ | src/io/syncpipe.c:

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix a conditional mess-up on Windows.

[09:32] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5f9e2d0ec6

[09:55] <JimmyZ> so all bugs that only happened on OSX is that only OSX is 'use strcit;' :P

[09:58] <jnthn> All tests successful.

[09:58] <jnthn> Files=931, Tests=34116, 248 wallclock secs ( 7.58 usr  2.87 sys + 752.64 cusr 98.85 csys = 861.94 CPU)

[09:58] <jnthn> Result: PASS

[09:59] <jnthn> On OSX. \o/

[09:59] <jnthn> First time I've ever got that there. :)

[09:59] * jnthn bumps TEST_JOBS up tfrom 4 o 8 and has another go

[10:02] <jnthn> Passes again...in 3 minutes. :)

[10:02] <jnthn> So hardware.

[10:02] <jnthn> Very core.

[10:04] <timotimo> \o/

[10:04] <timotimo> hardcore

[10:08] <FROGGS> I fear that I've introduced most of the things jnthn has to hunt down lately :o(

[10:09] <nwc10> FROGGS: that is a risk of being productive

[10:09] <nwc10> one can say the same about me and core perl 5 bugs

[10:09] <FROGGS> *g*

[10:10] <FROGGS> yeah, and well, I hopefully can say that I'm still able to learn things... so it is not hopeless

[10:11] <nwc10> I can't remember enough to successfully Google^WYahoo! it, but there's some parable about the employee who left, who was responsible for 50% of the bugs

[10:11] <nwc10> because, it turned out, he was also resposnbile for 75% of the progress

[10:11] <nwc10> I didn't quite phrase that right - he did most of the work, and his bug *rate* was actually lower than the other employees

[10:14] <JimmyZ> All tests successful? I can't get this on linux :(

[10:14] <nwc10> I have a TODO passing

[10:14] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Really? What do you have failing?

[10:15] <nwc10> and a (maybe) 25% ASAN failure from a thread test

[10:15] <nwc10> which I'd not mentioned before

[10:15] <nwc10> seems to be recent

[10:15] <JimmyZ> wait a moment

[10:15] <nwc10> but I think it's just tickling an old thing, as I can't nail any revision that "caused" it

[10:25] <JimmyZ> jnthn: http://pastebin.com/ANpY9hav

[10:26] <jnthn> Well, S17 one is maybe heisenbug, but the S02 one is odd.

[10:26] <nwc10> JimmyZ: I've never seen those two fail, so I can't suggest anything.

[10:26] <nwc10> however, I believe that nothing in my environment is outside of ASCII

[10:36] <JimmyZ> I think I can take a look

[10:36] <FROGGS> that is also what I am guessing... your env might contain Chinese stuff?

[10:37] <FROGGS> then it should also fail when you run it outside of the spectest

[10:37] <jnthn> .oO( environment variables with Chinese characteristics )

[10:37] <nwc10> we used to like fa_IR.utf8, because the decimal separator was 2 octets of UTF-8

[10:37] <nwc10> but these days it seems to be either . or , so back to one

[10:38] <nwc10> however, ps_AF.utf8 (IIRC - Pashtun, Afgahnistan) now seems to have this wonderful property

[10:53] <jnthn> Sounds like fun :)
