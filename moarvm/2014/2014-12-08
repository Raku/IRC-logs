[12:57] <brrt> \o

[13:00] <brrt> i just realised something

[13:00] <brrt> spesh can specialize escape analysis

[13:01] <brrt> like if you have $a.foo($b) - given if you know $a (and $a.foo), you can actually determine if $b will escape

[13:01] <brrt> a static compiler cannot

[14:21] <brrt> also: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nitsanw/02830114e93f1cf492d7/raw/gistfile1.asm - wtf, shl rbp ?

[14:21] <brrt> shift left base pointer? but why?

[14:22] <brrt> does jvm do this

[14:26] <brrt> scrap that i don't get that code *at all*

[21:23] <timotimo> a perf report over setting compilation seems to think we spend 5% of time in MVM_gc_add_roots_to_worklist

[21:29] <timotimo> for some reason, MVM_JIT_DISABLE seems to have lost its effect

[21:30] <timotimo> i don't think this report is correct. if the gc times grow and grow and grow, that ought to show a lot of time spent in gc stuff
