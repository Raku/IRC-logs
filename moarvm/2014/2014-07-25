[04:21] <TimToady> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6 seems to be leaking at a rate of about 75Mb per minute

[04:22] <TimToady> (I changed the ^6 to ^7 to try to find the 7th number, but it's already used 4 gigs of ram in about 50 minutes of runtime

[04:22] <TimToady> oops

[04:23] <lue> TimToady: did you mean a specific problem? Or are you referring to the rate at which problems are solved for Perl 6? :)

[04:23] <TimToady> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Find_palindromic_numbers_in_both_binary_and_ternary_bases#Perl_6

[04:27] <TimToady> the resident set is also going up to the same vicinity, which might indicate the GC is revisiting most of the pages

[04:27] <TimToady> or maybe it just means I have too much memory :)

[04:28] <ventica_desktop> moar backend?

[04:29] <TimToady> yup

[04:30] <TimToady> it's actually paging other stuff out, so I think it's probably all being visited

[04:32] <TimToady> starting to swap out X windows, so I'm killing it after an hour

[04:33] <TimToady> er, 75MB per minute, not Mb :)

[04:34] * lue realizes he should probably get to know the more sysadminy parts of his system sometime :)

[04:34] <TimToady> so about 1¼ megs per second

[04:40] <TimToady> actually, in the early stages, it goes up by about 3 megs a second

[04:40] <TimToady> that's without a gather/take too

[04:48] *** woolfy joined
[04:48] <TimToady> okay, loop { .base(3) } does not leak

[04:49] <TimToady> .base(3) for 1..* leaks about 6 megs a second

[04:49] *** lizmat joined
[04:51] <TimToady> 42 for 1..*;  # leaks 7 megs a second

[04:52] <TimToady> something's obviously not throwing away the used numbers, or something like that

[04:53] <lizmat> # ore like 9 megs / sec for me

[04:53] <lizmat> *more

[04:54] <TimToady> does not leak on jvm

[04:54] <lizmat> for 1..* { } also leaks

[04:54] <TimToady> though jvm starts with 3.5gig :)

[04:55] <TimToady> yes, the original loop was in that form, and all the stuff inside just served to hide the leak :)

[04:56] <lizmat> FWIW, I seem the same kind of leakage on parrot

[04:57] <TimToady> maybe jvm just hides it by allocating a gig of GC to start with...

[04:57] <lizmat> I wouldn't be surprise

[04:57] <lizmat> d

[05:01] <lue> Right now I'm using 17.9% percent of my ram on ^7, and climbing (I don't know which of the VIRT, RES, or SHR memory counts are relevant here)

[05:02] * lizmat is exhausted and will probably go to bed soon

[05:07] <TimToady> VIRT mostly

[05:08] <TimToady> RES is how much of VIRT is actually resident and presumably active, at least under load

[05:08] <lue> 897M is what htop's telling me right now

[05:08] <TimToady> at 17.9% it might not care

[05:09] <TimToady> took me 50 minutes or so to get up to 4 gig

[05:10] <lue> 4GiB is how much RAM I have at all :P

[05:10] <TimToady> then I'd suggest you not run it quite that far :)

[05:10] <TimToady> it won't find the 7th in 4 gigs

[05:11] * TimToady is currently running the jvm version to see if it leaks before finding the 7th

[05:11] <lue> yeah, it's never a fun time when the kernel steps in to kill things.

[05:12] <TimToady> my jvm's VIRT is nailed to 3482060 for most of the last hour, and hasn't budged

[05:27] <TimToady> RES on the jvm is creeping up at about 2 meg a minute; dunno if that means anything

[06:36] <ventica> ok... so looking for guidance on Async IO testing/bugs/code-clean up (this was suggested as a good place to begin contributing)... are there bug reports I should go read?

[07:33] * brrt figured out that it was much simpler to install the mingw32-w64 toolchain than to install a windows vm

[07:36] <brrt> and it is, but the answers are confusing

[07:39] *** FROGGS joined
[07:53] <brrt> it seems mingw64 compiles the full 8 bytes of stack space for every argument, even though they are 32 bits wide

[07:58] <moritz> alignment :-)

[08:00] <brrt> (obviously, posix isn't quite so friendly as it does take the argument size into account)

[08:03] <ventica_desktop> which windows vm?

[08:14] <brrt> any, i guess?

[08:14] <brrt> i can download a trial version of windows 8 or 7

[08:14] <brrt> and install this on a vm, but it's just work, you know

[08:14] <brrt> and i'm lazy :-)

[08:17] <ventica_desktop> :P

[08:19] <brrt> it seems i do the win64 ABI completely wrong

[08:22] <brrt> or, mostly wrong

[08:22] <moritz> that explains the blowups :-)

[08:23] <brrt> well, yes

[08:23] <brrt> the rules are a bit more arcane than i had imagined

[08:27] <jnthn> heh, so it wasn't a bastion of sanity over the posix one, after all? :)

[08:27] <jnthn> I use the MSVC compiler, fwiw. I think you can install Visual Studio Express for C++ to get the toolchain.

[08:28] * ventica_desktop shudders at the thought of MSVC

[08:29] * jnthn wonders what particular aspect of it causes the shudders

[08:30] <FROGGS> yes, the express does work well, I use that too

[08:30] <FROGGS> you just have to register at some point me thinks

[08:31] <ventica_desktop> jnthn: I guess it's more the whole dll hell thing when you get to linking... the compiler itself generates tight code but compatibility in the windows world is such a headache

[08:32] <ventica_desktop> or maybe interoperability is a better word than compatibility

[08:33] * moritz finds the whole PIC / non-PIC approach of DLLs interesting

[08:33] <jnthn> Perhaps that's why with .Net they went more with the "just copy all the things" approach :)

[08:33] <FROGGS> I love how you can compile something on your system, just zip it and ship, and it will work on any other windows system...

[08:33] <ventica_desktop> lol

[08:34] <FROGGS> try to do that on linux, I've got a debian 3 (!!) here for such things

[08:34] <jnthn> ventica_desktop: Did you manage to dig into the async code at all?

[08:35] <ventica_desktop> I looked through the asyncsocket.c (sp?) file, but it's pretty incomprehensible... watched a prez on libuv

[08:35] <brrt> calling conventions are never sane

[08:35] * brrt is now downloading windows 8.1 trial

[08:35] <ventica_desktop> incomprehensible *to me* (ramp and all that)

[08:36] <ventica_desktop> jnthn: After running the tests on my box and they passed, my question was if there's a specific place I need to be looking?

[08:37] <jnthn> Well, the async socket ones only seem to fail under load... :( Typical of race-y issues, I guess.

[08:38] <ventica_desktop> who wrote it?

[08:38] <ventica_desktop> the async socket code

[08:38] <jnthn> Me

[08:38] <brrt> bbi2h

[08:39] <jnthn> Doesn't mean the race is obvious to me, though, otherwise I'd have fixed it by now. :)

[08:40] <ventica_desktop> what are the kinds of I/O that asyncsocket.c is responsible for? sockets can connect lots of kinds of things and i can see that there are other files responsible for different kinds of I/O...

[08:40] <ventica_desktop> under /src/io that is

[08:40] <jnthn> At the moment, asyncsocket.c is just about providing TCP sockets (client and server)

[08:40] <jnthn> Should really teach it UDP also.

[08:41] <ventica_desktop> ok

[08:41] <ventica_desktop> and i see the tests are exercising  the localhost has the code ever been tested on remote connections?

[08:42] <jnthn> Well, when I first wrote it I had it doing non-local web requests at lest.

[08:42] <jnthn> *least

[08:42] <ventica_desktop> ok, cool

[08:42] <jnthn> (And that worked out fine.)

[11:49] <brrt> i've looked at the actual calling behaviour of win64, and conclude that the problem is more subtle than it appeared

[11:49] <brrt> also, more generic

[11:49] <brrt> to be specific, when i call a function and push parameters on the stack, i don't 'unpush' them, i.e. the stack top keeps on growing

[11:49] <brrt> the function epilogue doesn't take this into account

[11:50] <jnthn> Oh...

[11:50] <jnthn> Well, glad you're figuring it out :)

[11:51] <moritz> so, it's not a stack? :-)

[11:51] <brrt> it is a stack

[11:52] <brrt> it's... complicated

[11:52] <brrt> it's a good subject for a blog post, too

[15:06] <TimToady> jnthn: opinions on our memory leak we noticed last night?

[15:08] <jnthn> TimToady: If it's happening in Parrot *and* MoarVM, my first suspicion would fall on something being held onto for too long somewhere in, perhaps, MapIter

[15:10] <TimToady> but isn't that a case that you optimize away from MapIter?

[15:12] <jnthn> 1..1000000 is

[15:12] <jnthn> 1..* isn't

[15:13] <jnthn> It actually uses a native int, so it's bounds-checking the upper bound to fit within that at present.

[16:25] <brrt> oh, timotimo, i forgot to note your contributions, as well as a small guide on how to contribute

[16:25] <timotimo> i contributed?

[16:25] <timotimo> i already forgot :P

[16:25] <timotimo> ah, you mean the simple ops i hooked up to the respective c functions?

[16:26] <brrt> yes, these :-)

[16:26] <brrt> it's fun to see that i'm not the only one who can manipulate the code sucessfully

[16:27] <timotimo> well, that's only the part of the code where manipulation doesn't include changing the dynasm code

[16:27] <timotimo> because i haven't done any x86 assembly in my life so far and i was hoping i could skip that experience for a long, long time

[16:29] <brrt> why? it's fun :-)

[16:29] <timotimo> you mean °FUN°?

[16:30] <timotimo> the paragraph about type objects being asked for attributes seems like it doesn't explain what actually got returned instead of null ...

[16:30] <TimToady> degree quotes?

[16:31] <brrt> good question, i'd have to look at the respective at_key implementations

[16:33] <TimToady> some of the future is unevenly distributed to the past

[16:34] <brrt> much wow

[16:35] <TimToady> in fact, those would work in Perl 5 too

[16:35] <timotimo> now it'd be swell if there was a way to have these delimitors mix in a role when they are used

[16:35] <TimToady> (given appropriate uses at the top)

[16:35] <timotimo> do we have any mechanism specced to do that? i think we really ought to

[16:36] <TimToady> well, we used to do things like treat qx'' differently from qx"" in P5, but gave that up as a bad idea

[16:36] <TimToady> and I think if you really want such a language tweak, you don't want the q

[16:36] <timotimo> yes, i like the q vs qq more

[16:37] <TimToady> just write your own quote slang regex

[16:37] <timotimo> but how do i show dwarf fortress fans how awesome perl 6 is for being able to incorporate their memes into the language?

[17:47] <brrt> i'm wondering if it's an acceptable tradeoff to move all call arguments into a scratch register before putting them in their final place

[17:47] <jnthn> Well, I'll choose working over broken any day ;)

[19:02] <brrt> which is good, because that's what posix does as well

[19:03] <brrt> i.e. leftmost order is topmost (or actually, bottommost) on stack

[19:04] <rurban> BTW: beware of icc, this is backwards

[19:05] <brrt> if icc doesn't abide by an ABI then it is my professional opinoin that this is ICC's problem :-)

[19:06] <rurban> Well, in the rare case if someones wants to use it, you should know. But I forgot the details. icc generates faster code, so...

[19:07] <brrt> its actually a bit strange so few people use ICC, no?

[21:44] <FROGGS> when we're leaking we are leaking in C land I suppose

[21:53] <FROGGS> do we need to free any of these? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L861

[21:54] <jnthn> store_bigint_result stores them inside an Int or so, iirc

[21:55] <FROGGS> hmmm, almost thought so

[22:00] <jnthn> brrt: Sadly, no luck; we SEGV much more now, and my debugger is incredibly confused about the stack, which looks rather corrupted.

[22:17] <FROGGS> that fits the iteration count:

[22:17] <FROGGS> ==12997== 929,566 bytes in 999 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1,742 of 1,772

[22:17] <FROGGS> ==12997==    at 0x4C2C494: calloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)

[22:17] <FROGGS> ==12997==    by 0x4F67A74: MVM_validate_static_frame (validation.c:588)

[22:18] <FROGGS> jnthn: okay, but when I do that, I'll go to bed :o)

[22:18] <FROGGS> because slow valgrind is slow

[22:19] <jnthn> oh

[22:19] <jnthn> Well, maybe 10,000 is enough :)

[22:22] <jnthn> That should clear up a number of things

[22:22] <FROGGS> nice!

[22:23] <timotimo> .o( also, less memory use :P )

[22:24] <FROGGS> okay, valgrind is running now

[23:44] <timotimo> could i emit a method call in spesh without allocating new registers?

[23:47] <jnthn> Don't think so

[23:48] <jnthn> But the new register thing is really near the top of my spesh todo list now.

[23:49] <timotimo> good :)

[23:49] <timotimo> i forgot what the other thing was that i wasn't able to do so far due to that :\

[23:58] <timotimo> i wonder what'll happen next before register stuff happens :)
