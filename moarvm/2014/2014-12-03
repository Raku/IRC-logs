[09:45] <nwc10> mmm moar::cinclude is not a very useful config variable

[09:45] *** FROGGS joined
[09:45] <nwc10> moar::cincludes= -I3rdparty/libuv/include -I3rdparty/libuv/src -I3rdparty/libatomic_ops/src -I3rdparty/libtommath -I3rdparty/dynasm -I3rdparty/dyncall/dynload -I3rdparty/dyncall/dyncall -I3rdparty/dyncall/dyncallback -I3rdparty/linenoise

[09:45] * JimmyZ_ wonders what nwc10++ is hacking

[09:45] <nwc10> because that's only useful if you're building MoarVM

[10:52] *** danaj_ joined
[11:00] <jnthn> nwc10: I don't think we're very selective about what makes it in there and what doesn't...

[12:58] <brrt> \o

[12:58] <brrt> anybody break the JIT these days

[13:05] <jnthn> Doubt my patches coulda :)

[13:05] <jnthn> Not to mention I'm working in a branch :)

[13:09] <moritz> brrt: would you please write a blog post for the perl 6 advent calendar?

[13:09] <brrt> but but but

[13:09] <brrt> what would it be about

[13:09] <brrt> i know nothing

[13:09] <tadzik> hmmmmmmmmm

[13:10] <moritz> brrt: about your gsoc project

[13:10] <brrt> yeah.. i could do that, but that wouldn't be much of a surprise right now

[13:10] <moritz> brrt: sergot is also writing about his

[13:10] <brrt> perl6 has a jit? old hat ;-)

[13:10] <moritz> brrt: it's not meant to surprise anybody

[13:11] <tadzik> but it will surprise some :)

[13:11] <brrt> very well

[13:11] <moritz> brrt: it's meant for people who usually don't read much about p6

[13:11] <brrt> very well :-)

[13:11] <moritz> we've had about 1k views per day on the first two days

[13:11] <brrt> oh? not bad

[13:11] <moritz> which is much more than the usual p6 blog post gets

[13:11] <brrt> who is writing today

[13:12] <moritz> https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/perl6advent-2014/schedule says ab5tract

[13:14] <brrt> cjfields was from bioperl, right

[13:17] <jnthn> Yeah, advent calendar isn't about enws to us or clsoe followers, it's for the wider world :)

[13:19] <brrt> ok :-) i can't do it before the 17th because of exams

[13:19] <jnthn> Thankfully, advent lasts until 24th :)

[13:19] <brrt> but in the week after that i should be able to manage something

[13:20] <jnthn> OK. I'll do a more general MoarVM one before then

[13:20] <jnthn> Will likely mention spesh, but not JIT if I know you're going to post on that :)

[13:21] <brrt> what kind of detail would be suitable?

[13:21] <brrt> yeah, i probably will :-)

[13:22] <brrt> i'll probably not emphasize it's toyish nature too much

[13:22] *** vendethiel joined
[13:23] <jnthn> Right

[13:23] <jnthn> And it's not exactly toyish.

[13:23] <jnthn> When taken in totality with spesh.

[13:24] <jnthn> I mean, it's doing speculative type-based specializaing (implying deoptimization), inlining, on-stack replacement, etc. :)

[13:24] <brrt> in totality, no

[13:24] <brrt> that is true

[13:24] <jnthn> Perl 5's VM does none of that. :)

[13:24] <brrt> fair enough :-)

[13:25] <jnthn> Put another way, just because we can see how much mroe is possible doesn't mean we should forget how much we've already achieved. :)

[13:25] <jnthn> *more

[13:26] <brrt> that is true :-)

[13:26] <brrt> ok, i'll write a blogpost

[13:26] <brrt> (and hopefully one about the static-perl6-thingy, not that it's very useful but it is fun)

[14:06] *** vendethiel joined
[14:21] <timotimo> +1

[14:43] <lizmat> hmmm... a MoarVM build from scratch now fails for me on OS X

[14:44] *** FROGGS joined
[14:44] <lizmat> In file included from 3rdparty/libuv/include/uv-unix.h:55:

[14:44] <lizmat> 3rdparty/libuv/include/uv-darwin.h:26:11: fatal error: 'mach/mach.h' file not

[14:44] <lizmat> found

[14:44] <lizmat> I guess I shouldn't have updated Xcode :-(

[15:03] <brrt> fuuu

[15:03] <brrt> apple why u ...

[15:15] *** vendethiel joined
[15:22] <lizmat> seems to get fixed by adding a symlink to the "mach" directory of your OS X version to the libuv/include directory

[15:22] <lizmat> both in nqp/moarvm as well as in install (for rakudo, that is)

[15:27] <brrt> hmmmm

[15:28] <brrt> no, we can do better than that

[15:34] *** dalek joined
[15:37] * brrt can't confirm it, by the way, but i'm not sure if my build tried to make reaclean

[15:37] <brrt> lord clang is slow

[16:28] <brrt> lol

[16:28] *** brrt left
[16:45] <TimToady> actually, P5 does a small amount of inlining and constant folding

[16:45] <TimToady> but it's not pervasive as it is in P6
