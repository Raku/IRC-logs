[01:38] <japhb_> What's the opposite?  ENOUGHBEER?

[01:38] <[Coke]> mmheheh

[01:39] <japhb_> Am I reading the backlog right that a current build of r-m is not panda-friendly right now?

[12:55] <dalek> MoarVM: Make dump_backtrace more widely available.

[12:55] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:55] <dalek> MoarVM: Rename it to MVM_dump_backtrace, and have it non-static. It can be a

[12:55] <dalek> MoarVM: rather useful debugging aid.

[13:59] <brrt> \o #moarvm

[13:59] <brrt> netsplit is over again?

[13:59] <nwc10> good UGT, brrt

[13:59] <brrt> UGT?

[14:00] <nwc10> if it's in the glossary, I don't know where the link to that is

[14:00] <nwc10> "Universal Greeting Time" - ie, it's always "morning"

[14:00] <brrt> lol

[14:01] <nwc10> lizmat: where's the document with definitiions for things like RC?

[14:02] <lizmat> specs/S99-glossary.pod ?

[14:03] <nwc10> I think that that's the one

[14:04] <nwc10> except that it doesn't seem to mention RC

[14:04] <nwc10> or UGT

[14:04] <nwc10> my memory is clearly faulty

[14:06] <[Coke]> RC: Request Context! (oh, wait)

[14:15] <jnthn> conditional breakpoints, why u so slow?

[14:15] <nwc10> because!

[14:16] <nwc10> hack I've sometimes used is to recompile with a static variable counting stuff

[14:16] <nwc10> and have real code which is only entered if the count is correct

[14:16] <nwc10> (or whatever)

[14:16] <nwc10> and unconditionally break on that

[14:16] <nwc10> I have a tram to miss!

[14:16] <nwc10> :-)

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM: c527241 | jonathan++ | src/core/op (2 files):

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM: Cannot mark sp_arg ops :pure.

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM:

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM: Installing the locals still matters, since we may later deopt. May

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM: need something more general, but this avoids the issue for now.

[15:01] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c5272411d0

[15:08] <timotimo> does that fix a known problem?

[15:08] <jnthn> yes, see the patch I just pushed in nqp :P

[15:09] <jnthn> Now that's done we might be able to do some better stuff with for loops

[15:09] <timotimo> oh, lowering $_, huh?

[15:54] <nwc10> jnthn: not sure how far I'm going to get. The "torture" version is now somewhere in "Stage parse"

[15:54] <nwc10> which is an improvement on last night

[15:55] <nwc10> "torture" is very agressively allocating the overspil structure for "large" indexes

[15:55] <nwc10> but this one intentionally leaks like a sieve

[15:55] <nwc10> and I don't know how "fun" it's going to be fixing the leaks

[15:56] <nwc10> is there any macro available in Moar that gives the pointer size? sizeof(void *) isn't useful for this, as that's not something you can use in an #if in the pre-processor

[15:57] <jnthn> I'm not aware of one.

[15:57] <nwc10> I can't find one
