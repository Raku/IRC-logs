[00:28] <TimToady> fixed slurp.t, now says ok 15 - iso-8859-1 makes mojibake correctly

[00:28] <TimToady> turned out to be missing an "unsigned" on the char*

[00:29] <TimToady> down in src/strings/latin1.c

[00:30] <TimToady> I don't know why, offhand, passing negative codepoints reverted to interpretation as utf8, which seems bogus

[00:34] <TimToady> that seems to imply some kind of multi-pass decoding which would be bad

[00:35] <TimToady> or perhaps the semantics we want to check for combining chars at string concat time is being erroneously invoked between each character here

[00:37] <TimToady> some NFG assumption that its incoming bufs are utf8 strings maybe

[00:37] <TimToady> anyway, forcing the numbers positive seems to protect from whatever the downstream damage is

[10:08] <dalek> MoarVM: calculate correct offsets for character props

[10:08] <dalek> MoarVM:

[10:08] <dalek> MoarVM: The offsets were only correct up to about 0x3000.  Above that,

[10:08] <dalek> MoarVM: span extents were completely wrong.  Also, rather than trying to

[10:08] <dalek> MoarVM: keep the offset by relative means, all we really need to do is

[10:21] <timotimo> "all we really need to do is <transmission cut off>"

[10:23] <FROGGS> hehe

[10:23] <FROGGS> we'll never know :o)

[14:13] <FROGGS> I tried to create a serialization test for RT #121319, but I fail https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/06cdedfd323abddc6790

[16:32] <FROGGS> jnthn: do you have time to muse about that ticket?

[17:04] <jnthn> no

[17:04] <jnthn> gotta make dinner in a moment

[17:04] <jnthn> And serialization things often take a bit of time to hunt down :(

[17:07] <FROGGS> k

[17:08] <FROGGS> np, I have another problem to hunt down
