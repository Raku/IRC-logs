[17:19] <brrt> anyway, i recall having seen perl6 benchmark graphs from when the JIT was just merged

[17:21] <brrt> do you still have that somewhere?

[19:13] <timotimo> i've kept all benchmark html files i believe

[20:09] <timotimo> did you find the one(s) you were looking for?

[20:12] <brrt> wait very backlog

[20:13] <brrt> wow, for some of the things (especially the native stuff) this pays off

[20:13] <brrt> yeah, thanks :-)

[20:13] <brrt> and sometimes it's also slower

[20:14] <brrt> although usually by a rather small margin

[20:16] <timotimo> well, we could do another jit vs no jit benchmark run

[20:16] <brrt> i'd like to see that of course

[20:16] <brrt> do you have the raw numbers too?

[20:16] <timotimo> possibly not

[20:17] <brrt> oh, they're in the document itself

[20:17] <brrt> with some work that can be extracted

[21:05] <timotimo> brrt: now i've had dinner, which commit should i compare jit vs no jit with?

[21:06] <brrt> ehm, what about the 2014.08 release?

[21:06] <brrt> or is that really annoying?

[21:06] <timotimo> no, that's absolutely no problem

[21:06] <timotimo> what about the 2014.09?

[21:06] <brrt> no problem to me

[21:07] <brrt> i don't think the results will be that different though

[21:07] <timotimo> maybe maybe not ;)

[21:07] <timotimo> afaik the push performance improvement happened after that release, though

[21:08] <timotimo> are you interested in nqp-moar vs nqp-moar-jit, too?

[21:11] <brrt> hmm whichever :-)

[21:12] <timotimo> i'm doing rakudo-moar vs rakudo-jit 2014.08 and 2014.09

[21:17] <brrt> awesome :-)
