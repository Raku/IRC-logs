[15:15] <hoelzro> o/ #moarvm

[15:29] <brrt> \o hoelzro

[15:29] <hoelzro> o/ brrt

[15:29] <brrt> off-topic: recall the statement that 'luajit useth no pointers' in their IR?

[15:30] <brrt> i recall vaguely writing a html-recompiler once (in perl) that used a very similar strategy

[15:30] <brrt> to representing the tree

[15:30] <brrt> the entire tree was contained in a single array, and a 'open' tag contained the offset of it's corresponding 'close' tag

[15:31] <brrt> of course, the close tag wasn't strictly necessary, but they were used as triggers

[15:33] <jnthn> Sounds neat. I'm sure I used a similar trick somewhere once too...forget where exactly.

[15:47] <brrt> not all roses and sunshine. cutting out a part of the tree was... tricky

[15:48] <brrt> but yeah, it can be done :-)

[16:05] <hoelzro> has anyone had a chance to look at my removal of MVM_file_stat_follow_symlink changes?

[16:09] <JimmyZ_> hoelzro: looks good

[16:09] <hoelzro> I'm just hoping I'm not missing anything with the removal of that manual resolution logic

[16:09] <hoelzro> I think FROGGS wrote it?

[16:10] <hoelzro> JimmyZ_: thanks for looking!

[16:10] <JimmyZ_> yeah

[16:10] <jnthn> hoelzro: Does it change the current behavior (in so far as, things work the same aside from the potential infinite loop bug that should now be gone)?

[16:10] <hoelzro> jnthn: it doesn't change the current behavior

[16:12] <jnthn> OK

[16:13] <JimmyZ_> hoelzro: +1 to merge, as long as it doesn't break roast :)

[16:13] <hoelzro> I roasted last night; no beans were burnt =)

[16:30] <hoelzro> jnthn: regarding that exception thrown from callbacks issue I reported earlier this week, what would it take to catch the exception from the nested interpreter call and re-throw it up to the nesting interpreter?

[20:24] <jnthn> That's a re-deliver of an earlier one, just to check I got it right :)

[20:25] <hoelzro> ok, I was confused =)

[20:25] <jnthn> :)

[20:25] <jnthn> New dalek :)

[20:26] <TimToady> is it going to stay named that?  'cuz my highlighter picks the p6 over the dalek... :/

[20:27] <moritz> TimToady: nope, I plan to rename it back to dalek once the feather3 instance has been shut off
