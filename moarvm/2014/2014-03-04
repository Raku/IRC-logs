[06:41] <lue> I'm having a problem where perl6-m segfaults upon trying to create a directory it doesn't have the permissions to make.

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: 44de6a5 | larry++ | / (9 files):

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: add opcodes for unibool and unimatch

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM:

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: Some tables naturally return boolean values, so getuniprop_bool will

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: now return those raw values.  On the cooked end of things, matchuniprop

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: provides access to the fully aliased property matcher that regexes use

[20:13] <dalek> MoarVM: for things like <:Nd>.
