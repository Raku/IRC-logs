[11:12] <carlin> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/163

[11:30] <FROGGS> carlin: the patch to libtommath should be reported upstream also

[11:30] <FROGGS> and should be committed to nqp/3rdparty as well

[11:51] <carlin> nqp pull req at https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/206

[11:51] <carlin> would libtommath take these patches?

[11:56] <dalek> MoarVM: do not call srand() if not using rand()

[11:56] <dalek> MoarVM:

[11:56] <dalek> MoarVM: there is no need to call srand on the platforms that arc4random is used

[11:56] <dalek> MoarVM: this silences the warning OpenBSD's ld gives when it sees srand called

[14:39] <carlin> libtommath merged my pull request already, yay

[14:40] <FROGGS> wow

[14:46] <brrt> carlin++

[15:23] <hoelzro> has anyone scrutinized my latest PR? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/161

[15:23] <hoelzro> I was wondering if there was something unexpected I would be breaking

[15:23] <nwc10> I tested it, and I think it's an improvement on what we have

[15:24] <nwc10> oh, wait, sorry, I looked at the other

[18:33] *** FROGGS joined
[18:43] <jnthn> hoelzro: I'm certainly good with 9af3581

[18:43] <hoelzro> jnthn: cool, what are your thoughts on c667d60?

[18:45] <jnthn> FROGGS: I think (sorry if wrong) that it might have been you who added the code being removed in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c667d6046362f04698c56badd6421a43e2e95dee ?

[18:45] <jnthn> hoelzro: My thoughts are "I'm sure I didn't put that code there, I want to understnad what led to it" :)

[18:45] <FROGGS> the what?

[18:46] <jnthn> Hang on, I'm doing git blame :)

[18:46] <FROGGS> jnthn: I put the code in there that got removed in that diff, aye

[18:47] <jnthn> Yeah, git blame thinks so too

[18:48] <FROGGS> and it solved an issue back then...

[18:48] <FROGGS> :o)

[18:48] <jnthn> Hmm

[18:48] <jnthn> Can you remember what?

[18:48] <jnthn> 4a8dac66 seems relevant

[18:48] <FROGGS> well, data->fd was uninitialized for some reason

[18:49] <jnthn> a109e8d7 also

[18:49] <hoelzro> jnthn: that's why I didn't just push it =)

[18:50] <hoelzro> if the check for data->filename were to remain, I would argue that it should be considered only if data->fd were uninit'd

[18:51] <FROGGS> I think the code that caused an issue was: perl6 -e 'say lines' < foo.txt

[18:51] <FROGGS> or so

[18:53] * hoelzro builds and tries

[18:53] <nwc10> with the change, the EOF test fails on an unseekable file

[18:53] <jnthn> FROGGS++ hoelzro++

[18:53] <nwc10> eg

[18:53] <nwc10> ./perl6-m -e '.say for lines' <(cat /etc/motd )

[18:53] <nwc10> but the change is better than the status quo

[18:53] <nwc10> (where that also fails, for some reason)

[18:54] <nwc10> sadly, I believe that the only "reliable" way to do EOF is "try to read a byte"

[18:54] <hoelzro> agreed

[18:54] <nwc10> which, obviously, has issues about blocking

[18:54] <hoelzro> oh, is that why that stat == seek_pos check is done?

[18:54] <hoelzro> I read that last night, and it really bugged me

[18:54] <FROGGS> hoelzro: that's the ticket that resulted in my patch: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121720

[18:55] <hoelzro> FROGGS: thanks!

[18:55] <nwc10> I don't have a great answer for any of this - I'm not familiar with the MoarVM code, nor with libuv

[18:55] <nwc10> nor with what flexibility there is

[18:55] <nwc10> nor with how to be portable to both POSIX and Win32

[18:55] <nwc10> (if not further)

[18:55] <nwc10> but "improvement" is better than "Status quo, awaiting perfection"

[18:56] <hoelzro> I wouldn't mind having some regression tests for both of these behaviors; where do those belong?

[18:58] <nwc10> (I don't know)

[18:59] <jnthn> In roast feels sensible to me, somewhere under S16 I guess

[19:00] <hoelzro> FROGGS: good news! that behavior doesn't happen with my patch =D

[19:00] <FROGGS> hoelzro: nice!

[19:04] <jnthn> nwc10: About the "fails with unseekable file" - did it also fail before the patch?

[19:04] <nwc10> jnthn: yes, differently

[19:04] <nwc10> so I think that the patch is an improvement, as I'm not aware of anything that it causes to regress

[19:05] <jnthn> Right, i first understood what you wrote as meaning "it's a regression2

[19:05] <nwc10> ah sorry, no, wasn't clear

[19:05] <jnthn> But yeah, if it's not, and it doesn't bust the RT causing the code we're removing, then I think I'm good with it

[19:05] <jnthn> May be worth verifying on OSX, unless one of you is on that...

[19:05] <nwc10> and as well as the specific test case, the exisitng approach is a definate race condition, hence a security(ish) bug waiting to happen

[19:06] * nwc10 was not

[19:06] <jnthn> Oh, moritz++ filed the bug, and I am sure he'd not be on OSX... :)

[19:07] <jnthn> So I'm good with verifying the bug is still gone on Linux. :)

[19:08] <jnthn> So, +1 from me to hoelzro++ patch too, unless anybody has any objections.

[19:08] <nwc10> to be very clear, I tried my little test with the <( ) shell syntax on linux with and without

[19:08] <nwc10> I've not tried the specific test case that it attempted to fix

[19:09] <nwc10> but from reading the code, I think that it's an improvement

[19:09] *** FROGGS_ joined
[19:10] <hoelzro> alright, I'll push those then

[19:10] <hoelzro> I should probably test different encodings too

[19:12] <hoelzro> I think we could also ditch MVM_file_stat_follow_symlink as well

[19:12] <hoelzro> actually, I think that function will spin forever on a self referential symlink

[19:17] <jnthn> You can have...self-referential symlinks? :P

[19:18] <FROGGS_> hehe

[19:18] <FROGGS_> some of us perhaps, yeah :D

[19:18] <hoelzro> ln -s bar bar

[19:19] <jnthn> but...but why? :P

[19:19] <hoelzro> no reason, but it's possible =)

[19:20] <nwc10> "it's a trap"

[19:22] <hoelzro> you could also have foo -> bar -> baz -> foo

[19:22] <japhb> jnthn: I suspect that since *nix can't cheaply solve the problem of arbitrary symlink loops, it simply throws up its hands and refuses to give a 90% solution that might leave you with a false sense of security.  (But I don't actually know the history.)

[19:22] <japhb> What hoelzro said

[19:23] <hoelzro> what confuses me about MVM_file_stat_follow_symlink is that stat follow sym links

[19:24] <hoelzro> so it seems redundant

[19:24] <hoelzro> but that's my Unix bias showing

[19:24] <FROGGS_> as I've learned there is stat and then lstat

[19:24] <FROGGS_> and the one we used did not follow symlinks

[19:25] <hoelzro> lstat doesn't

[19:25] <jnthn> japhb: I have a windows bias, so I'm just like, "bah, you crazy kids with your symlinks" :)

[19:25] <FROGGS_> that's why "foo".IO.s reported 3, since the name has three bytes

[19:26] <FROGGS_> jnthn: well, you can mount volumes in a folder nowadays... perhaps you get symlinks by 2020

[19:26] <jnthn> :P

[19:29] <nwc10> Apple re-implemented their OS onto FreeBSD (on a Mach micro-kernel)

[19:29] <nwc10> So maybe MS should re-implement theirs onto OpenBSD

[19:30] <nwc10> and stun the security naysayers

[19:30] <japhb> .oO( Unix: Three decades ahead of Windows in basic functionality, three decades behind in video driver stability)

[19:30] <tadzik> hehehe *sniff*

[19:35] <FROGGS_> I don't need a video driver to ssh into another box :o)

[19:47] <jnthn> Funny thing is, when the video driver crashes on Windows these days - which is for me about 2-3 times a year - it's just like "oh, your video driver crashed, so I respawned it for you, kthxbai" :)

[19:52] <tadzik> heh, I see games crashing on linux every now and then

[19:52] <tadzik> and dmesg just says "there was a segfault, it's gone now"

[20:30] <jnthn> brrt: No, I can't get the NQP tests to blow up on Windows...

[22:15] <timotimo> holy fuck github has source code highlighting in diffs now

[22:15] <timotimo> <3

[22:19] <japhb> The intro to your statement made me think of The Illuminatus! Trilogy.

[22:24] <timotimo> i've only read the first book - and in german

[22:24] <timotimo> i had a hard time understanding it

[22:24] <timotimo> but i think it's supposed to not be understood

[22:25] <japhb> I would easily believe that a translation would make it even worse.

[22:26] <timotimo> hmm

[22:26] <japhb> I read it after I saw a review that said essentially "after 100 pages, I wondered why anyone would read this, after 200 I thought it had potential, after 300 I couldn't put it down".  Which was essentially my experience.  :-)

[22:28] <timotimo> hah! :D

[22:29] <[Coke]> If you're looking for other mind-rending books to read, I just finished Kraken by China Miéville.

[22:32] <timotimo> i may give illuminatus! another try

[22:58] * tadzik has just finished VOY

[23:00] <japhb> VOY?

[23:01] <tadzik> Voyager

[23:02] <japhb> The book or the TV show?

[23:06] <tadzik> oh, there's a book? :) No, just the show

[23:13] <japhb> So what did you think of the ending?  :-)

[23:13] *** colomon_ joined
[23:15] <tadzik> it is a bit of a deus ex machina

[23:15] <tadzik> bit aside from that, I liked it :)

[23:15] <tadzik> it surprised me a few times

[23:26] <[Coke]> Ugh, I watched every ep on dvd from netflix over the course of a few months.

[23:29] <japhb> [Coke]: No streaming?

[23:30] <japhb> I've got to say I'm impressed with modern streaming encodings.  Even with our crappy internet connection, streaming video usually looks way better than DVD video.

[23:31] * japhb wonders if Netflix ever reversed their decision way back when to stop carrying Blu-Ray disks

[23:46] <[Coke]> japhb: this was about 6 years ago.

[23:46] <[Coke]> wasn't available for streaming then.

[23:49] <japhb> Ah, gotcha.

[23:53] <[Coke]> plus with dvds you can watch them at work on your break!
