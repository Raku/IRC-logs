[09:46] <timotimo> well, I can't come up with a better way to do it than emitting QAST and piping it through a getcomp'd compiler

[09:48] <timotimo> but i'm worried that that'll create a full new CompUnit and/or serialization context for each class that gets created somewhere

[10:18] <JimmyZ> timotimo: could you help me install do on hack.p6c.org?

[10:18] <JimmyZ> *dot

[10:18] <timotimo> sure, what trouble are you running into?

[10:19] <JimmyZ> I want to run perl6 graph_spesh.p6 a_nice_excerpt.txt | dot -Tsvg > helpful_graph.svg

[10:20] <JimmyZ> and I need dot

[10:20] <timotimo> sure

[10:20] <timotimo> the package you need to install is graphviz

[10:21] <JimmyZ> yeah, so you have sudo :P

[10:24] <timotimo> oh, i thought you had that, to

[10:24] <timotimo> gimme a sec :)

[10:25] <timotimo> done

[10:27] <JimmyZ> thanks

[10:29] <timotimo> YW

[10:30] <JimmyZ> I got a lot of 'found register without writer'

[10:30] <timotimo> yeah

[10:30] <timotimo> not important

[10:36] <JimmyZ> hmm, parsing 4M files takes servral minutes

[10:37] <timotimo> er

[10:38] <timotimo> the tool can only handle a single routine

[10:38] <timotimo> oh, wait

[10:38] <timotimo> you mean 4 million individual files?

[10:51] <JimmyZ> the filesize is 4M

[12:23] <FROGGS_> JimmyZ: how do you parse it?

[12:23] <JimmyZ> timotimo: how can use graph_spesh.p6 build only matched one cuid?

[12:23] <JimmyZ> FROGGS_: by using graph_spesh.p6

[12:23] <FROGGS_> ahh yes, I almost thought so

[12:24] <FROGGS_> err, "for lines() :eager -> $_ is copy {"

[12:24] <FROGGS_> converting that into a grammar will speed it up a lot

[14:30] <timotimo> oh, really?

[14:30] <timotimo> i didn't know that, but that's a good point

[14:31] <timotimo> if you'd like to do that (and measure) ... :)

[14:55] <JimmyZ> timotimo: Did you see my question?

[15:24] <timotimo> you use a text editor to cut out the cuid you're interested in, JimmyZ

[15:24] <timotimo> i told you

[15:24] <timotimo> 113724  timotimo â”‚ the tool can only handle a single routine

[15:24] <timotimo> and only the before or the after or the finished part

[15:24] <timotimo> it is not meant to input a complete spesh log

[15:28] <JimmyZ> oh, how did I miss the log

[15:28] <timotimo> :)

[15:28] <timotimo> i should probably see to it that i give that program more documentation, a proper MAIN and USAGE etc etc

[15:29] <JimmyZ> P6opaque.c only spesh 64 bits, do we need spesh 32 bits?

[15:30] <timotimo> i don't understand. what do you mean?

[15:31] <JimmyZ> timotimo: flat_ss->bits == 64 in P6opaque.c

[15:32] <timotimo> i'm not sure if we even have 32bit integers inside a P6int?

[15:32] <timotimo> oh, wait ... perhaps we do?

[15:33] <JimmyZ> timotimo: we have 16 bit too.

[15:33] <timotimo> but we don't have an op that would get a 16bit integer at an offset?

[15:33] <JimmyZ> yeah
