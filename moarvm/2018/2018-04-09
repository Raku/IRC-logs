[21:41] <MasterDuke> lizmat: fwiw, i tried creating a template for captureposarg (or one of the ops like it) a while ago, but currently the template compiler doesn't like string literals, so i couldn't do the throw

[21:43] <MasterDuke> however, throwing in the template may not be necessary (i think) if timotimo++'s declarative_op_checks branch lands
