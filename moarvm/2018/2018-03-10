[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Add windows1251/2 support for replacements with > 1 chars

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This adds support in MVM_string_windows125X_decode for using

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: replacements which have more than one grapheme in them. Previously this

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: function only supported replacements with one grapheme in them.

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MVM_string_windows125X_decodestream still only supports single grapheme

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: replacements for now.

[02:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/1fca17994d

[02:09] <samcv> hmm what is the best way to test decodestream functions? reading a file handle i guess?

[02:10] <samcv> didn't implement multiple replacements yet because i haven't written tests yet for that function.

[23:42] <FROGGS> src/math/bigintops.c:971:13: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

[23:42] <FROGGS> timotimo^^

[23:43] <timotimo> huh

[23:44] <timotimo> is RAND_MAX available? because that's what it is #defined to be

[23:45] <FROGGS> how can I check?

[23:45] <FROGGS> btw, I'm using system's libtommath, maybe there is a newer version

[23:45] <FROGGS> ohh yes, there is a newer one...

[23:46] <timotimo> yeah, maybe they changed something

[23:46] <FROGGS> yeah, bigintops got compiled successfully

[23:47] <FROGGS> that mipsel chroot is more than one year old, so that explains it
