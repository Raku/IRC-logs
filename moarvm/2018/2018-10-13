[10:30] <timotimo> i wonder what extra info we can easily add to a "malformed utf-8" error message

[10:30] <timotimo> like, if we have a decode stream applied to a file handle or something, can we easily output how many bytes we've read so far? so it'd be easier to find in the file? i'm not sure if there's communication between seek and decodestream apart from "reset your buffer please"
