[08:42] <ItchyPlant> Hi, just checking in to tell you that I managed to compile Rakudo on AIX (works both on 7.1, 7.2). :)

[08:44] <ItchyPlant> I used "truss" to get more details about how that moar process dies during compilation and found "Err#12 ENOMEM" entries before it got segfault.

[08:44] <ItchyPlant> So I googled and found this in some pages but maybe this one tells it best: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK94490

[08:45] <ItchyPlant> So MoarVM's Makefile has this linking flag, and after that, all NQP, Rakudo compiles, all tests pass:

[08:45] <ItchyPlant> LDFLAGS   = -Wl,-bmaxdata:0x80000000,-brtl -O3 -DNDEBUG -L"//opt/rakudo/lib"

[09:35] <samcv> ItchyPlant: so we need that compile flag on all AIX?

[09:35] <samcv> just to have -bmaxdata:0x80000000 added?

[09:38] <samcv> ah looks like only 32 bit builds maybe?

[09:41] <samcv> anyway, i need to sleep now. will check on messages tomorrow :) good work

[09:53] <ItchyPlant> I was also experimenting what if I add block to 3rdparty/dyncall/dyncall/dyncall_macros.h about _AIX and not use libffi. In that case it passed the initial phase but failed here:

[09:53] <ItchyPlant> dyncall_callvm_ppc32.c:57:2: error: #error Unsupported OS for ppc32 architecture.

[09:57] <ItchyPlant> So I reverted to the original solution, to just use "--has-libffi"

[10:00] <ItchyPlant> I wrote a step-by-step instruction about what had to be done to get it working... I'm still working on it. May I do it on Reddit or is there a better place for it?

[10:04] <lizmat> ItchyPlant: perhaps a PR for MoarVM documentation ?

[10:04] <ItchyPlant> or rather on gist.github.com?

[10:04] <ItchyPlant> what is that? :)

[10:05] <lizmat> ItchyPlant: wherever you want to put it...

[10:05] <ItchyPlant> OK

[10:06] <lizmat> someone will make sure it won't get lost by putting it in some repo where it will be kept

[10:17] <nine> 11.878s! master is at 11.576s. Soooo close now

[10:24] <nine> ItchyPlant: that's great! Thanks for pushing this through!

[10:25] <ItchyPlant> Thank you all for all your help! It's a great community! :)

[10:55] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/master: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/0b5bde835d15...fbdb36d761c2

[10:58] <nine> ^^^ fixes, (read|write)(u?int|num) ops (jnthn++'s suggestion for the new API for handling binary buffers), serializetobuf and buffertocu ops and improved support for uints

[10:59] <timotimo> will nqp get these ops right away, even before the new mast compiler?

[11:00] <nine> That's the plan, yes

[11:00] <timotimo> cool.

[11:01] <nine> If for no other reason than to make my rebases easier :)

[11:01] <timotimo> right

[11:01] <timotimo> i'll also be rebasing a thing or two

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: decont on nativeref shall become decont_* + box_*

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: this way we should later be able to use the deconted

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: value directly without boxing it first, and then

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: more easily get rid of a native ref taking instruction.

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: set flags & known type on spesh slot

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: unblocks optimizing the box_* into a fastbox, in the

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: case of box_i it will even go through the int cache.

[11:15] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/950fb0e1f5

[11:15] <timotimo> this, for example

[11:15] <nine> very nice :)

[11:17] <timotimo> maybe you can get the remaining ~0.4s by getting rid of the coerce_iu that follows the const_i64_16 :) :)

[11:18] <lizmat> timotimo nine: time for a version bump ?

[11:18] <nine> I wouldn't bet on it.... so far such clear optimizations have always yielded results that were hardly measurable. Only the sum of the optimizations has driven the time down

[11:19] <timotimo> right

[11:19] <timotimo> it was tongue-in-cheek anyway :)

[11:20] <timotimo> it's just that sometimes really wasteful-seeming bytecode offends me :D

[11:20] <nine> Same here

[11:20] <timotimo> i mean, coerce_iu is surely extremely cheap

[11:20] <timotimo> but using it on a constant is just silly

[12:40] * lizmat wonders why ItchyPlant just removed a new reddit post ?

[12:42] <ItchyPlant> I didn't post it under r/perl6 first, then I removed, but that didn't look disappeared, reposted... now it should be OK I guess. I'm new on reddit too. :)

[12:43] * lizmat comments again  :)

[12:46] <ItchyPlant> thanks

[14:31] <timotimo> nine: write_buf doesn't check for the slot type of the array before it uses the .u8 slot

[14:32] <timotimo> that could go kind of wrong if it's used on a 16bit integer or 32bit integer vmarray

[15:31] <nine> Ok, this is becoming absurd. How on earth can it be that I get better times for stage mast if MVM_SPESH_LOG=spesh.log is set?

[15:32] <nine> The first two or three times I just thought it's random fluctuation. But it's...surprisingly consistent.
