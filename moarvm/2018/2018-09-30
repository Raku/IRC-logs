[12:24] <nine> Looks like I've come across the first case where I have to change the actual compilation result. The result register kind of an nqp::if depends on the kind of the then and else branches. But I only know those after actually compiling them. So I may have to introduce intermediary registers.

[12:48] <timotimo> nine: alternatively, use istrue_o and then if_i

[12:49] <timotimo> spesh does that anyway, but of course if_o results in smaller .moarvm files

[12:52] *** MasterDuke left
[12:54] <nine> How would I use them there?

[13:14] <timotimo> actually, i'm not entirely sure what problem you're actually edscribing

[13:14] <timotimo> i think i might have gotten it wrong

[13:14] <timotimo> sorry about that

[13:18] <nine> The result type of nqp::if($cond, $then) is either the type of $cond if $cond and $then have the same type or just obj. The result type of nqp::if($cond, $then, $else) is either the type of $then if $then and $else have the same type or again just obj. In cases where $cond and $then or $then and $else have different types we also need to coerce the result to obj.

[13:18] <nine> My problem is that I only know the result type of $else after compiling it. So I don't know whether I need a coercer or not.

[13:19] <timotimo> oh!

[13:19] <timotimo> because the blocks return their result

[13:19] <timotimo> i was thinking of the underlying bytecode %)

[13:28] <jnthn> Also I think there's a void handling where the return values don't matter

[13:29] <nine> There is, yes. Which doesn't exactly make the code easier to digest ;)

[13:30] <nine> So I need an intermediary register for $then and coercion code which I emit after the $else and a goto in $else to jump over the $then coercer

[13:32] <jnthn> Yeah, but the void context things have quite some nice performance impacts :)

[16:58] <nine> Buuut....since I'm thinking of fixing up things afterwards already, would it be possible to fix up the register kind? That's really all that's dependent on the op's children.

[17:02] <nine> Of course that's not enough, since I also would need the coercing code

[21:59] <samcv> what is this? JIT ERROR: Negative offset for dynamic label 8

[22:00] <samcv> it occured when i tried to call a method that doesn't exist for that type

[22:00] <samcv> No such method 'base' for invocant of type 'Str'. Did you mean any of these?

[22:04] <timotimo> well, that's pretty bad

[22:05] <jnthn> Looks like a "the impossible happened" kind of error...

[22:17] <samcv> working on updating us to unicode 11

[22:20] <jnthn> samcv++

[22:22] <timotimo> cool

[22:22] <samcv> i'm glad there was nothing wrong with the collation, it just had a minor issue regenerating the file. because diving into that would be a huge pain

[22:24] <jnthn> Looks like some grapheme clustering changes, alas.

[22:24] <samcv> i'm still amazed at how well it works. and there's only one function which  looks a bit ugly

[22:24] <samcv> jnthn: yep

[22:24] <samcv> i have that fixed afaik already

[22:24] <jnthn> Though from the glimpse I took at it, it looked like it might just be a simpliciation.

[22:24] <timotimo> https://imgur.com/sW017ei - super crappy early look at my current task

[22:24] <jnthn> But maybe I'm just being an optimist :)

[22:24] <samcv> yeah i had to change some things

[22:25] <jnthn> NaN% :D

[22:25] <samcv> it *did* make it simpler. my hours of time wasted! now i have to get rid of my code to workaround "should not break within emoji (you may have to modify these rules)"

[22:25] <timotimo> yeah, the columns will be replaced by allocation-related columns

[22:25] <samcv> something to that effect. i remember i thought the language used was humorous

[22:26] <samcv>  Further customization of this rule may be necessary for best behavior of emoji zwj sequences [UTS51]

[22:26] <samcv> that's it

[22:26] <jnthn> hah, I loved that...

[22:26] <jnthn> Might as well have said "Good luck with this!"

[22:26] <timotimo> can zwj become the new ffs ...

[22:26] <samcv> ffs?

[22:26] <timotimo> for f's sake

[22:26] <samcv> ah that's what i guessed but

[22:27] <samcv> wasn't 100% sure

[22:27] <timotimo> just make zwj an expletive

[22:27] <timotimo> doesn't even matter what you invent for the expanded version

[22:33] <timotimo> jnthn: you don't happen to have another blog post just about ready to release? :D
