[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: [Spesh] remove object boolification from optimize_iffy

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy:

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: Optimiziing object boolification in optimize_iffy is the same as it

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: would be in optimize_istrue_isfalse, so it makes more sense (to me) to

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: have it performed there.

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: [Spesh] Optimize known values for istrue

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy:

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: Original optimize_iffy tried to optimize for known object values, but

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: we can make optimize_istrue_isfalse do the same thing.

[08:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/spesh-refactor-iffy: Doesn't seem to happen very often, though.

[09:53] <brrt> good *

[09:53] <yoleaux> 7 Mar 2018 22:11Z <MasterDuke> brrt: would a jit bisect with my ishash template be useful?

[09:53] <brrt> .tell MasterDuke probably not

[09:53] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[09:53] *** zakharyas joined
[09:53] <brrt> if you want i can look at it somewhat sooner

[09:54] <brrt> what confuses me is that there is somehow a cast in there

[22:23] <MasterDuke> .tell brrt if you're already working on something else that's cool, i am just a little worried that, given how simple that template is, other templates using similar constructs might have a hidden problem that just hasn't popped up yet

[22:23] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to brrt.
