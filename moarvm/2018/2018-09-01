[02:12] <japhb> timotimo: I'd love to see if the ratios between those different timings in your faster FASTA post remain the same in the post release optimizations branch (and if not, how much the landscape changes).

[02:13] <timotimo> TBH i was running the post-release optimizations branch the whole time

[02:14] <japhb> *chuckle*  OK, that's not the answer I expected, but it's a good one.  :-)

[02:14] <timotimo> which also means it won't get better by applying post-release-opts a second time :(

[02:14] <japhb> True

[21:40] <Kaiepi> something's that been bugging me a while about my pullreq for getting socket fds from async sockets for a while

[21:41] <Kaiepi> it'd be useful to be able to get the server's socket's fd before having to wait for a client to connect

[21:41] <Kaiepi> is there some way to accomplish that that i'm not realizing?

[21:42] <Kaiepi> it'd be useful to know what the server's socket is as soon as it's instantiated, since using setsockopt on it transfers the same options to client sockets in certain cases

[21:42] <Kaiepi> rather than having to wait until a client connects before you can do anything with it
