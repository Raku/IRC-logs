[19:56] <dogbert17> brrt: does this tell you anything? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/55d8106e0a9b6612a6212eff6f44cf00

[20:06] *** robertle joined
[20:09] <timotimo> that looks very much like "VM was shutting down, but something was still running"

[20:09] <timotimo> not quite

[20:09] <timotimo> looks more like a thread was being joined

[20:10] <dogbert17> timotimo: perhaps, it's the last test in t/06-telemetry/01-basic.t

[20:13] <samcv> if anyone wants to look at the changelog draft https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[20:15] <brrt> dogbert17: nothing whatever, sorry

[20:16] <timotimo> a few of the changelog entries are "X" and "throw out X", which is weird

[20:17] <samcv> yeah it's not 100% done. but was wondering if someone else wanted to help fix the JIT and spesh sections

[20:17] <samcv> since others know more about those changes than I do

[20:18] <dogbert17> "Gree copied spesh_slots in one missing place"

[20:18] <timotimo> free*

[20:18] <dogbert17> fixed

[20:20] <samcv> if you guys can do the jit and spesh sections that would be ++

[20:21] <timotimo> let me have a look

[20:21] <samcv> great

[20:21] <samcv> and tehn i'll finish up the rest of it

[20:22] <robertle> "Modify as suggested in code-review: jnthn++" doesn't say a lot

[20:24] <timotimo> i removed that already

[20:24] <robertle> sounds like a great release overall though!

[20:24] <samcv> robertle: yeah i'll get to that section in a bit. i just needed help with the jit and spesh type stuff. i was gonna move or delete a bunch of the ones under src/core

[20:25] <timotimo> + Add libatomic_ops as a submodule instead of in-tree

[20:25] <robertle> sure, just happened to note that when reading through it. don't have much of a filter between brain and mouth at

[20:25] <timotimo> + Move libatomic_ops module to a different directory

[20:25] <robertle> the moment

[20:25] <timotimo> which one should we keep?

[20:25] <timotimo> + Patch libtommath to fix build on Solaris

[20:25] <timotimo> + Fix Solaris build by fixing a compilation error in libtommath

[20:25] <timotimo> + Fix Solaris 32-bit build: don't build specify -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS for dyncall

[20:25] <timotimo> is the third one the same as the other two?

[20:26] <samcv> the last two

[20:26] <samcv> i'd move the last two into misc and then move+ Add libatomic_ops as a submodule instead of in-tree into misc too

[20:27] <timotimo> i'll throw out a few changes that have been in-between releases

[20:28] <timotimo> for example the "throw out spesh retry mechanism" was only alive for a week or two

[20:30] <timotimo> i saved a few changes, but the lines i pasted above i didn't touch yet

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> fwiw github doesn't handle simultaneous edits by different people, so be careful with that

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> but yes, the whole idea of using a wiki page for that was that it should be easy for others to do corrections, so timotimo++ dogbert17++ MasterDuke++ :)

[20:35] <AlexDaniel> fwiw rakudo changelog is also ready for that: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[20:38] <samcv> AlexDaniel: can it do a rebase though? since it uses git in the backend

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I would have expected it to do a proper merge with potential merge conflicts, but it just refuses to do that for some weird reason

[20:39] <samcv> so it just writes over the other changes?

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> it simply says ‚Äúsomeone edited the page page so your changes are gone‚Äù, or something like that

[20:39] <samcv> oh i get Someone has edited the wiki since you started. Please reload this page and re-apply your changes.

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> yea ok, that

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> why can't it just make a regular commit is completely beyond me

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> especially given that there's git backend designed for that kind of situation

[20:41] <samcv> it would be nice even if they don't hve enough time to make a ui to resolve conflicts

[20:42] <samcv> to bsically say: someone else modified it. do you want to merge or abort?

[20:42] <samcv> and then you can click merge

[20:42] <samcv> or rebase or whatever

[22:09] <samcv> can someone help write this line: + Convey the process ID of a started child ??

[22:09] <samcv> ?? added by me. what does this convey the PID to

[22:09] <samcv> commit 7198eb801 by jnthn

[22:11] <samcv> i have the changelog done except the spesh section and that line ^^^

[22:13] <timotimo> it conveys it to the user code

[22:13] <samcv> getrusage? which op?

[22:14] <timotimo> no, i think it's spawnprocasync?

[22:17] <samcv> ok should i put that down? or are you unsure

[22:17] <timotimo> it's useful for our users to know

[22:19] <timotimo> "Switch order of insert" sounds meaningless without context, maybe it can be dropped, as it's "just" part of the "split iffy into two parts" work anyway

[22:28] <jnthn> Thanks for the release work :)

[22:29] * jnthn has been a bit distracted with afk stuff the last days

[22:30] <jnthn> (The good kind, thankfully :)
