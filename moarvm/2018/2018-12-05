[13:17] * timotimo discovered "perf mem record"

[13:18] <MasterDuke> what does that do?

[13:18] <yoleaux> 3 Dec 2018 02:12Z <SmokeMachine> MasterDuke: thank you very much!

[13:19] <timotimo> it samples read and/or write memory accesses

[13:20] <MasterDuke> so not similar to heaptrack, which does allocations, correct?

[13:20] <timotimo> correct

[13:21] <timotimo> i wanted to see if there's a tool that'd draw memory as kind of an image and show me what pieces were active when

[13:21] <MasterDuke> interesting. can you get that from perf mem record?

[13:22] <timotimo> in theory i think yes

[13:23] <timotimo> it's difficult, of course, when the address space is kind of fragmented

[13:23] <timotimo> however, you can actually ask for physical addresses instead of logical addresses

[13:23] <timotimo> then you'll only have addresses in the range from 0 to however much ram you have

[13:23] <timotimo> still fragmented, though

[13:24] <timotimo> but not from 0 to 2 ** 64 :)

[13:24] <MasterDuke> hm. would the logical addresses be less fragmented though, even if spread across a greater range?

[13:24] <Kaiepi> asking again since there was no response last time, can someone review https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/993 ?

[13:27] <Kaiepi> it won't stop being a wip until the .native-descriptor pullreq on rakudo is merged, but otherwise it's pretty well finished

[13:27] <timotimo> ooooooh my calendar post needs to be finished by midnight today

[13:28] *** Ven`` left
[13:29] <timotimo> need to get some late breakfast in before i can do much of anything

[13:31] <nwc10> "All day breakfast at the UGT cafÃ©"

[13:32] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: i don't know socket programming well enough anymore to comment on the functionality, but i gave a couple minor comments on formatting, etc

[13:32] <Kaiepi> thanks
