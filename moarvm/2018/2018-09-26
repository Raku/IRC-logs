[21:06] <timotimo> you know ... we could speculatively devirtualize reprops in the jit, i.e. check for the STable of an object being one specific pointer, and then immediately dispatch to the known repr op function, otherwise go via the STable to the REPRops and getting that

[21:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kencjohnston8

[21:07] <timotimo> that way we can devirtualize reprops that follow, for instance, p6ogetvc_o, like i'm seeing a couple of times in spesh logs (now that spesh logs contain jit info as well)

[21:09] *** kencjohnston8 left
[21:12] <timotimo> hm, so we'd be accessing the object's header to find the STable value and check that, as opposed to grabbing the STable, following its pointer, grabbing the REPR, following its pointer, grabbing the REPRop in question, which is likely at a high offset, then calling that

[21:12] <timotimo> i wonder what percentage of hit for the cache will make the cost for the extra check & branch go away again

[21:29] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/b01c70e2f7ce4a40eddc19517e3aee87

[21:30] <timotimo> being able to reason about lexicals would be kind of cool

[21:42] *** Tiraspol8 joined
[21:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Tiraspol8

[21:43] <jnthn> timotimo: Hm, but a p6ogetvc_o will have been a getattr, which will have been emitted with a guard if there's a stable type?

[21:44] *** Tiraspol8 left
[21:45] <timotimo> i mean the return value, which doesn't necessarily have a const stable

[21:47] <jnthn> Hm, I might be missing the point; mine was that getattr's return value is logged and guarded if stable (and the guard is used for something)

[21:48] <timotimo> oh, OK

[21:48] <timotimo> i should check for places in the spesh log where something after a getattr where the return value does get an op devirted on it

[21:48] <timotimo> oh, i'll push a WIP of the "some jit stuff goes in the spesh log" modification

[21:49] <timotimo> i'm not happy with the results yet, but it's already interesting

[21:49] <jnthn> heh, that code snippet could sure benefit from GVN or CSE or whichever

[21:50] <jnthn> It's loading and guarding the newval lexical 3 times?!

[21:52] <timotimo> we talked about this a long time ago, or at least it feels like that

[23:31] <MasterDuke> timotimo: cool, thanks

[23:32] <timotimo> i wonder what other _*I ops can benefit from a special path in the jit for smallbigint

[23:32] <timotimo> like, maybe coerce_nI?

[23:53] <MasterDuke> timotimo: instead of the jit just calling MVM_bigint_from_num like it does now?

[23:54] <timotimo> yeah, if the value is in range for a 64 bit integer it could instead do it right then and there

[23:54] <timotimo> but i don't know how expensive that check is

[23:55] <timotimo> maybe we could log what values coerce_nI is being called with typically in some choice programs

[23:58] <MasterDuke> oO(if only we had a comprehensive benchmark suite we could instrument for such a purpose...)
