[09:51] <jnthn> D'oh, one can get spesh dump to crash because it assumes it can look up the filename string index in the comp unit of the thing the top-level graph is for, but of course it might be inlined code from a totally different CU

[09:51] <jnthn> Now I'm wondering if the profiler either solves this or trips over this. :)

[10:40] <brrt> \o/

[10:41] <brrt> by the way, if new statistics come in for the inlinees (does that still happen?), will they be replaced?

[10:41] <jnthn> Not at the moment, no

[10:42] <brrt> hmm.

[10:42] <jnthn> Well, doesn't happen, nor will they be replaced

[10:42] <brrt> because, once speshed, the logging instructions will be removed..

[10:52] <jnthn> It only comes out empty if I set an MVM_SPESH_LIMIT :S

[10:52] <jnthn> How would that change anything...

[10:54] <jnthn> Oh...huh, it now only dumps the limited frame...in theory

[10:54] <jnthn> But in reality it's dumping nothing

[11:05] <jnthn> It gets stranger.

[11:06] <jnthn> Also the error is

[11:06] <jnthn> At Frame 12, Instruction 14, op 'trunc_i8', operand 0, MAST::Local of wrong type (17) specified; expected 1

[11:07] <jnthn> Which looks a lot like the native.t or whatever it was failure that nwc10 reported the other day

[11:07] <jnthn> Which is making me suspect this isn't to do with my branch

[11:07] <brrt> no, that is very probable

[11:07] <brrt> I / we broke something and i've yet to figure out what

[11:08] <jnthn> Yeah, it seems very action-at-a-distance-y

[11:09] <brrt> try if it breaks under MVM_JIT_DISABLE

[11:09] <jnthn> MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 ./perl6-m -Ilib t/spec/S12-construction/named-params-in-BUILD.t

[11:09] <jnthn> That reliably fails

[11:09] <jnthn> With MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 it reliably works

[11:10] <jnthn> With MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1 it...huh, worked once, but mostly fails

[11:11] <jnthn> So yeah, it seems JIT-y

[11:13] <brrt> hmm :-(

[11:13] <jnthn> My gut instinct given the action at a distance is also memory corruption-y

[11:13] <jnthn> Oh

[11:13] <jnthn> Or deot

[11:13] <jnthn> *deopt

[11:13] <brrt> well, that one works for me, unfortunatley

[11:13] <jnthn> If it's placing the interpreter back in a bogus place

[11:14] <brrt> possibly, but why would that happen

[11:14] <jnthn> No idea

[11:14] <jnthn> t/spec/S02-types/native.rakudo.moar fails in a similar way, which is the one I think you noticed

[11:15] <jnthn> And also works with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1

[16:00] <dogbert17> brrt: my git fu is far from optimal but it seems that the strange jit error, as seen in /spec/S02-types/native.rakudo.moar,  was introduced by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/354c62bdca1be082b61939fdcf6a4129e6992760

[16:00] <dogbert17> can that be possible?

[16:01] <timotimo> it's always possible that one op being introduced causes an op that is sometimes problematic to appear in a spot that triggers the problem

[16:03] <dogbert17> timotimo: I did this 'bisection' in the most incorrect way, I manually checked out versions and tested until the problem disappeared, which it did with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6646038f59e0b10b4cf73e194c6e060ffabb594f

[16:04] <timotimo> that's fair

[16:04] <timotimo> you can now use the jit bisect tool on top of the git bisect

[21:31] <MasterDuke> it also complains about a couple cases like `if (flags || g->facts[i][j].dead_writer || g->facts[i][j].writer && g->facts[i][j].writer->info->opcode == MVM_SSA_PHI) {`, where it wants parens around the && expression

[21:32] <MasterDuke> any opposition to adding the parens in that case (and a couple similar) to silence the warning?

[21:34] <jnthn> Not really, just don't expect me to wite them in the first place. :)

[21:34] <jnthn> I consider it as obvious as + and *

[21:34] <jnthn> But I figure others don't. :)

[21:52] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Yes, then promptly forgot. I set it up on a server I have and don't know why it stopped working.

[21:52] <jnthn> So I guess I'd have to look at why, though it was also a total hack.

[21:53] <MasterDuke> jnthn: you were using https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench ?

[21:53] <jnthn> Yes

[21:53] <MasterDuke> ah, then you'll need to update it

[22:38] <brrt> anyway, I have a fix for the issues the native type JIT issues

[22:38] <brrt> it was load sizes :-)

[22:38] <jnthn> Hurrah :)

[22:38] <jnthn> brrt++

[22:39] <jnthn> I suspect the --no-jit mode breakage is one of my recent changes, though I've no idea which one. Will have to hunt that tmorrow.

[22:40] <jnthn> I thought I might have figured out a quick win for deopt stuff earlier today, but it turns out not.

[22:40] <jnthn> Well, actually, I did realize a few things

[22:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/434e4950a7

[22:41] <brrt> what did you learn?

[22:41] <jnthn> That you can't just use "where do we have things that actually deopt" before doing dead instruction elimination to decide what to keep

[22:42] <jnthn> Since if we deleted entire basic blocks, the instructions doing the using of stuff will be long gone

[22:42] <jnthn> But we delete basic blocks early to make PHI nodes shrink to, if we're lucky, a non-merge

[22:43] <jnthn> And we'd not want to lose that

[22:43] <brrt> uhuh

[22:43] <jnthn> It's not yet clear to me if the approach is entirely flawed or if it is salvageable by keeping information around about what deleted basic blocks used

[22:44] <brrt> hmmm

[22:44] <jnthn> I did realize along the way that we should probably separate out "kept alive for deopt" and out from usages though.

[22:45] <brrt> i'm a bit too tired to give useful commentary :-)

[22:45] <brrt> but i guess that makes sense

[22:45] <jnthn> For one so we can understand that's what's going on in the spesh log, but also it means that if we optimize something to the point where it has zero possible points of deopt, we can just toss them all

[22:46] <jnthn> And for deopt-free inlinees, we can drop our reluctance to go optimizing those too

[22:46] <brrt> uhuh

[22:46] <jnthn> Also, I'll probably need to re-work the `set` instruction elimination at some point soon too

[22:46] <jnthn> It screws the SSA form utterly
