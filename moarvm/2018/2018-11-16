[03:25] <timotimo> random discovery of the day: circumfix:<[ ]> from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/array_operators.pm6#L6-L28 has a takeclosure + capturelex that even in the "before" bytecode isn't used. it points at line 15, which is "BEGIN nqp::getcurhllsym('default_cont_spec')". this prevents inlining, and I wonder if that causes lots of stuff not to be inlined all over the place; anything that has

[03:25] <timotimo> p6scalarwithvalue that uses BEGIN to get at the default_cont_spec, in particular

[08:43] <brrt> \o

[08:43] <yoleaux> 15 Nov 2018 20:16Z <nine> brrt: scratch that idea of JITing while interp shutdown. We don't reach the end of MVM_interp_run and not even the FUDGED! message in t/spec/S06-advanced/callframe.rakudo.moar. But in all cases, we finish all tests.

[08:44] <brrt> ah, that's another one than t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t

[08:56] <brrt> hmm, i'm getting JIT ERROR: Negative offset as well

[10:19] <brrt> so. the expression type as assigned is normal enough, it is the node type which is negative that is weird

[10:24] <brrt> oh, that wasn't actually so bad

[10:27] <brrt> we're being decently careless about signed/unsigned register types

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: [JIT] Fix signedness issues

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: - MVMOpInfo.operands are unsigned chars, and correctness in reading

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:   the mask depends on that, oops

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: - Register allocator doesn't care about signedness (doesn't matter one

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:   bit for storage), so the same-register-type assertion can ignore the

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:   upper nibble.

[10:36] <brrt> now you can all hate me a bit less again

[11:00] <timotimo> i'm not sure i'm metaphysically capable of hating you any less, brrt

[11:03] <brrt> hehe

[11:03] <brrt> well, you can hate the JIT a bit less then :-)

[11:03] <lizmat> so, should we do a bump ?

[11:03] <brrt> hmm

[11:06] <brrt> we might. But there's a bunch of branches I want to get in as well. And there's another issue that nwc10 reported that I think is something different

[11:23] <dogbert11> I do see a strange failure when running with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 and MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[11:24] <dogbert11> 'Too few positionals passed; expected 2 to 59464 arguments but got 0'

[11:28] <dogbert11> e.g.   MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 ./perl6 t/spec/S06-multi/value-based.t

[13:05] <dogbert11> brrt: it does disappear with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 perhaps I should try a bisect

[13:06] <timotimo> does disabling only the exprjit also help?

[13:09] <dogbert11> timotimo: yes it does disappear

[13:09] <brrt> hmmm

[13:09] <brrt> alright

[13:09] <timotimo> then jit bisect could helep

[13:10] <dogbert11> have run the bisect three times, it always complains about the same frame (3226)
