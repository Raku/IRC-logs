[15:43] <brrt> ohai dogbert17, timotimo

[15:43] <timotimo> hai there

[15:43] <brrt> I take it the fateful commits with the asyncsocket thing were reverted

[15:43] <brrt> it's a shame, I would've happily debugged that

[15:44] <timotimo> we can still unrevert it for some debugging joy :)

[15:53] <dogbert17> it'll probably be reverted ahain before long :-)

[15:53] <dogbert17> *again

[15:55] <dogbert17> the flapper above is probably not JIT related but could perhaps be something for jnthn

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: split "cleared bytes" into managed/unmanaged

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: since the unmanaged bytes amount is sometimes so gigantic,

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: that the profiler accidentally underflows "cleared bytes"

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: into the negative.

[20:03] <nine> I wonder what disadvantages would be there for doubling the interning arity limit?

[20:04] <dogbert17> looking a bit at the SEGV mentioned by XLiff and SqrtNegInf

[20:05] <dogbert17> with no flags the example (https://gist.github.com/SqrtNegInf/2b0ccf921e2c5b529432555c74ece006) SEGV's but with the JIT off I get

[20:06] <dogbert17> This type cannot unbox to a native integer: P6opaque, Mu

[20:06] <dogbert17>   in sub crc32 at /home/dogbert/.rakudobrew/moar-master/install/share/perl6/site/sources/B11DB940E55C33C6937C1A1A778565879AE880A0 (String::CRC32) line 51

[20:06] <dogbert17> as written in the gist

[20:07] <dogbert17> the SEGV is like this: #0  0x00007f8ab1ce83a6 in MVM_repr_at_pos_i (tc=0x1b27a50, obj=0x0, idx=-4294967273) at src/6model/reprconv.c:97

[20:07] <dogbert17> 97     if (REPR(obj)->ID == MVM_REPR_ID_VMArray) {

[20:12] <jnthn> nine: Probably a drop-in-the-ocean amount of extra memory use (I think the array of interns is allocated as a fixed size)

[20:28] <tadzik> mmm

[20:39] <lizmat> timo: yeah, you do need to label your axes  :-)

[20:40] <lizmat> timotimo: hmmm.. on second thought, I'm not sure I'm following

[20:40] <timotimo> yeah, i do :)

[20:41] <timotimo> https://i.imgur.com/rtKD4oL.png

[20:41] <timotimo> and i just did

[20:44] <nine> Considering how much of spesh's magic depends on callsite interning, I'd argue for setting the limit not too low artificially

[21:05] <lizmat> timotimo: I would s/Timing/Spent  and put the "after prev" values into a new column called "Idle"

[21:05] <lizmat> and remove the word "spent" on each line

[21:20] <dogbert17> looks as if the SEGV I blabbered about an hour ago is caused by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d8065362a3b0657ad343ac85975d4c70794a133b

[21:26] <lizmat> timotimo: ^^^

[21:29] <timotimo> oh? crap?

[21:33] <dogbert17> it's a large change, could it just be a tiny mistake ...

[21:54] <timotimo> could you put a default: MVM_panic(1, "oh no"); into that switch/case?

[21:55] <timotimo> though it wouldn't get past that "if" if it didn't take one of the branches

[22:38] *** brrt left
