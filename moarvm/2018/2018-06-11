[20:42] <lizmat> samcv: I find this https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=1216424 a bit disturbing

[20:43] <lizmat> it looks like I cannot enter a ⚛️ by itself

[20:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 20bf96f9e: OUTPUT: «("ATOM SYMBOL", "VARIATION SELECTOR-16").Seq␤»

[20:43] <lizmat> but it always gets a variation selector-16 behind it

[20:43] <lizmat> (I wonder how Comma deals with this)

[20:44] <lizmat> not sure where this would need to be fixed (if at all)

[20:45] <lizmat> https://emojipedia.org/variation-selector-16/  states "Only required if the preceding character defaults to text presentation."
