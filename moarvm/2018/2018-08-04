[14:53] * jnthn is back from holiday travels

[14:53] <yoleaux> 29 Jul 2018 08:41Z <nine> jnthn: The NativeCall JIT issue reported in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2036 goes away when run with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1. Setting MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 only makes the issue appear earlier (after ~260 iterations instead of ~14000). Also in every test run there's only a single iteration giving a wrong result. Do you concur that this sounds very much like an OSR issue?

[14:53] <yoleaux> 29 Jul 2018 08:45Z <nine> jnthn: JIT compiled native calls with rw arguments are the only code that uses the getarg_i OP (for reading back the modified value from the arg buffer). Maybe OSR is not treating that correctly?

[14:53] <yoleaux> 31 Jul 2018 14:37Z <tyil> jnthn: the comma IDE newsletter in non-html only shows non-english messages to read it online at anpdm.com, which makes it look shady (imo)

[14:55] <jnthn> Hm, that's not so many messages...phew :)

[14:55] <jnthn> I hope nobody is expecting me to backlog a whole week's worth of stuff. :)

[14:56] <lizmat> jnthn: no worries... I wouldn't

[14:56] <jnthn> .tell nine Not immediately clear it'd be an OSR issue, unless it goes away with MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE=1 (which ain't one of the flags you mentioned)

[14:56] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to nine.

[14:56] <lizmat> people will know where to find you!

[14:56] <jnthn> Well yes, I figure that :)

[14:56] <lizmat> glad to see you back, hope you had a good time!

[14:56] <jnthn> Hm, is this + before my nick new...

[14:56] <lizmat> spam

[14:57] <lizmat> a ddos spam attack has been going on for most of the past week

[14:57] <jnthn> The same silly one that was going on before I left?

[14:57] <lizmat> you can get on the channel, but you cannot say anything for the first N seconds

[14:57] <jnthn> (Fake blogs about freenode staff...)

[14:57] <lizmat> yep

[14:57] <lizmat> and some blurb about IRC advertising  :-(

[14:58] <lizmat> which is just an invitation to get your machine taken over (if it is Windows)

[14:58] <jnthn> I'd have hoped they'd have gotten bored of that by now...

[14:59] <lizmat> maybe the bots got out of hand, the IP's are from all over the place :(

[15:01] <jnthn> Yeah, distributed attacks are hard to defend against and litigate.

[15:03] <jnthn> Nice to see there's been some positive comments on my grant extension request while I've been away :)

[16:22] <jnthn> Hmm, intersting :)

[16:23] <jnthn> What's the folder icon thingy do?

[16:23] <timotimo> it opens up or closes the part that you see there in the screenshots already

[16:23] <timotimo> i.e. the list of callees or paths for each routine

[16:24] <timotimo> more different stuff goes there in the future

[16:25] <timotimo> the big "Routines" heading from the first screenshot has been replaced with the little "tabs" that let you switch the view

[16:30] <timotimo> the border on the sides could be stronger to make the nestedness clear, but i think if you use it rather than just look at a screenshot it's better
