[17:19] *** shareable6 joined
[17:21] <samcv> just fixed an issue with MVM_LIKELY and MVM_UNLIKELY. glad i caught it. see comment description for full info, but basically often we do if (variable) as shorthand for if (variable != 0)

[17:21] <samcv> but __builtin_expect(variable, 1) is actually expecting variable to be 1 technically, and so i added it so

[17:21] <timotimo> good catch

[17:21] <samcv> #define MVM_LIKELY(condition) __builtin_expect(!!(condition), 1) now

[17:35] <timotimo> huh

[17:35] <timotimo> does it accidentally !! values that were supposed to be 0 or any value now?

[17:37] <samcv> well it just adds !!( ) to MVM_LIKELY and MVM_UNLIKELY and then expects it will be 0 or 1

[17:37] <timotimo> hm, this isn't supposed to change actual behaviour, right?

[17:37] <samcv> no

[17:37] <timotimo> because that looks pretty broken in travis

[17:37] <samcv> yeah that's why i made a commit after it a8ceea01ce which fixed it

[17:37] <samcv> i forgot to commit two lines
