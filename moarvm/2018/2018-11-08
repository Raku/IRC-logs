[00:20] <MasterDuke> jnthn, samcv, et al.: seems like it might be a good idea for someone to mention perl 6 in the hackernews commentary about the swift string atricle i mentioned the other day https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18394640

[00:23] <MasterDuke> timotimo: you might also find https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/cross-language-performance-profile-exploration-with-speedscope/ interesting

[00:55] <timotimo> cool

[11:49] <nine> dogbert11: the next commit is "Working bootstrap files" so I don't think b8ecfa43 is gonna build

[12:12] <dogbert11> nine: true, it was an amateurish attempt by me where I tried older and older nqp commits trying to figure out when the build hang on 32 bit systems began

[12:16] <dogbert11> given that this is a reasonable way to debug this (doubtful), commit d373f655, i.e. 'Working bootstrap files' is the first commit which causes the nqp build to hang without any kind of error message

[12:17] <dogbert11> on 32 bit systems, it still works on 64 bit ones

[12:17] <timotimo> i wonder if for some reason building bootstrap files on a 32bit system makes them not work on a 64bit system

[12:18] <timotimo> that'd obviously be a very bad bug

[12:19] <dogbert11> perhaps my way of 'bisecting' is not the correct one :)

[12:26] *** zakharyas left
[12:31] <dogbert11> hmm, I lied (or I'm doing something totally bogus) because I can't build nqp commit d373f655 on my 64 bit rig either. I get 'MVMHash representation requires MVMString keys - at gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:7014  (src/vm/moar/stage0/QAST.moarvm:add)'

[12:32] <dogbert11> timotimo: are you still around?

[12:32] <timotimo> o/

[12:32] <dogbert11> cool, am I doing the correct thing when tryin to build nqp

[12:33] <timotimo> i'm not entirely sure :(

[12:33] <dogbert11> 1 - go to nqp dir 2 - checkout interesting commit 3 - perl Configure.pl --backends=moar --gen-moar 4 - make (here it fails)

[12:34] <timotimo> --gen-moar will not rebuild moar if it is newer than what you have

[12:35] <timotimo> you'll want to force the exact commit from the MOAR_REVISION to be checked out

[12:36] *** evalable6 left
[12:37] <dogbert11> yeah, to be honest I have also tried step 2.5 - rm install/bin/moar

[12:40] <timotimo> i don't think that's enough

[12:40] <timotimo> i think it might look at the git repo to see what commit is there?

[12:40] <timotimo> hum

[12:40] <timotimo> no, that doesn't sound like a thing that we'd do

[12:51] <dogbert11> it's a mystery :)

[12:56] <nine> dogbert11: unfortunately the changes I did are barely bisectable at best. The changes in the nqp an MoarVM repos are too closely tied and it can be quite a challenge to get that stuff to build.

[12:57] <nine> I think plain old debugging will help best here.

[12:59] <dogbert11> nine: darn; i was hoping that I might be able to save you some time by doing a little prep work :(

[12:59] <nine> I appreciate that very much :)
