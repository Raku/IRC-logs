[13:11] <nwc10> t/spec/S32-list/sort.t SEGV is "just" a SEGV, says ASAN.

[13:11] <nwc10>     #0 0x7f9eb21aec58 in MVM_string_check_arg src/strings/ops.h:36

[13:11] <nwc10>     #1 0x7f9eb21b8691 in MVM_string_equal src/strings/ops.c:1426

[13:11] <nwc10>  (and the backtrace stops)

[13:16] <dogbert2_> nwc10: how often do you run your tests?

[14:17] <nwc10> manually, and when I notice

[14:21] <masak> nwc10++

[14:24] <dogbert2_> nwc10: so there's a chance that this bug is quite new then

[14:41] <nwc10> past day or so, I think

[14:42] <nwc10> mmm, not certain on that. Tests fail regularly in parallel under ASAN, so "some tests failing" is unfortunately the steady state

[14:42] <nwc10> and I get fed up with running them manually and seeing them pass

[14:42] <nwc10> so I tend not to, unless the reported exit status looks like an actual ASAN abort

[14:49] <dogbert2_> thanks, sounds like a job for our resident bisectable expert AlexDaniel

[20:40] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: recognized to not have a Str or Num method, but

[20:40] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: since we made them, we can be sure (if the user
