[10:35] <yoleaux> 3 Jun 2018 08:17Z <nine> brrt: yes, I came a cross the same discrepancy. It doesn't make sense, but apparently works. But I guess it does so only because of some happy accident in how the Perl 6 code is compiled

[10:35] <yoleaux> 3 Jun 2018 08:20Z <nine> brrt: The "good" news is that the JIT compiled version is not yet used anyway, since the getattr_* ops are still missing and I've hit another strange issue trying to implement them.

[10:35] <yoleaux> 3 Jun 2018 08:26Z <nine> brrt: note that the original encoderep op shares the same oddity which was introduced in a commit by jnthn titled "JIT-compile write_fhb and encode ops."

[10:35] <brrt> nine++ for fixing it

[19:20] <samcv> submitted my talk for the NL perl workshop

[19:20] <lizmat> samcv++

[19:21] <samcv> though may give the same one on YAPC EU maybe. idk i doubt i'll find something better to talk about (about security and hashing)

[19:21] <samcv> i guess that's ok doing the same talk twice?

[19:24] <brrt> samcv++

[19:24] <brrt> not necessarily

[19:24] <brrt> lots of people do the same talk more than once

[19:24] <samcv> ok :)

[19:25] <samcv> this is the discription fyi https://gist.github.com/samcv/e8ac9dd6c5636fe9c8e9c749224ceb89

[19:57] <jnthn> Repeating a talk first done at a workshop at a YAPC is probably especially fine: a lot of people won't have had chance to see it at the workshop, and for those who have it's a multi-track event :)

[19:57] <jnthn> *or* they can see it again if they really enjoyed it :D

[21:35] <samcv> well i just got (i think) the intel c compiler

[21:36] <samcv> downloading now at least

[22:18] *** ilogger2 joined
[22:39] <samcv> it was not at all happy i don't use a supported OS so had to hack one of the files to pretend i had something. since it checked dpkg or rpm to see if i had a library and not if the files were on the system

[22:40] <samcv> interested to try out the profiler that i think comes with this software package

[23:24] <lizmat> and another Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/2018-23-opened-closed/
