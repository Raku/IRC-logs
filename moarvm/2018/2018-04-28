[11:48] <samcv> dogbert17: just arrived in NL and got your message

[11:49] <samcv> --4048-- WARNING: unhandled amd64-linux syscall: 1000318 hmm

[11:51] <samcv> jnthn: hmm actually i think valgrind is right

[11:54] <jnthn> samcv: Ah, in that the syscall isn't actually available?

[11:54] <jnthn> We seem to be coping with that, though...

[11:54] <samcv> jnthn: no, i accidently left in debug code to make sure the syscall was handled gracefully

[11:54] <jnthn> oh.

[11:55] <samcv> i am reading the valgrind document though, since i may want to implement that anyway

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This code was accidently left in to make sure the syscall failing was

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: handled gracefully. Now that it's removed it should work properly.

[12:07] <samcv> jnthn: valgrind warning is fixed now

[12:07] <samcv> since now it recognizes the syscall number

[12:08] *** lizmat joined
[12:09] <jnthn> ooh, nice :)

[12:09] <jnthn> samcv++

[12:11] <samcv> luckily they have it included, because their description seemed pretty annoying to do if it wasn't one of the already programmed in sys call's

[12:23] <timotimo> oh, your nl visit is now!

[12:24] <timotimo> on friday i came back from a short visit to my parent's which is near the nl border :|

[12:26] <samcv> timotimo: too bad i missed you

[12:26] <samcv> pretty jetlagged atm

[12:27] <timotimo> i can only imagine

[12:27] <timotimo> if we meet in person you can bonk me on the head for not doing anything for the unicode database compression thing :|

[12:39] <samcv> hah, don't worry about it

[12:44] <chansen_> compressing the character names?

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/2018.04.1:

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/2018.04.1: With the original method we had problems with handling denomals

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/2018.04.1: (so e.g. 5e-324 ended up as 0e0) and had precision issues where

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/2018.04.1: NOT the closest representable num was generated for a given string,

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/2018.04.1: which causes value drift in repeated num->str roundtripping.

[20:29] <lizmat> ah, that's old

[20:29] <brrt> ah, ok. that's not my doing either, though :-)

[20:31] <lizmat> make runs to completion :-)

[20:32] <brrt> that's something

[20:32] <brrt> then i presume my double-labelling workarround works

[20:33] <brrt> on windows it is complete pain though

[20:38] <brrt> then again, i may be able to use that to my advantage

[22:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/pluggable-spesh: Since the lookup only happens on a miss, the lock here is probably not

[22:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/pluggable-spesh: going to be too highly contended over. We can revisit that if profiling

[22:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/pluggable-spesh: suggests otherwise (with some kind of read-only lookup).
