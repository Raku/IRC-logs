[19:37] <lizmat> does this have stealable ideas ?  https://www.opsian.com/blog/javas-new-zgc-is-very-exciting/

[19:38] <brrt> heh

[19:38] <brrt> I was reading that actually

[19:39] <brrt> I'm not too fond of the pointer-masking tricks

[19:40] <brrt> I think theyre mapping the upper bits

[19:40] <timotimo> you only get what, 48 bits on x86_64? address space, i mean?

[19:40] <timotimo> well, that's physical address space i think?

[19:40] <brrt> hmmm

[19:40] <timotimo> eew, load barriers

[19:41] <brrt> we don't have those

[19:41] <brrt> we have write barriers

[19:41] <timotimo> a long time ago jnthn already said we'd have to have those to get concurrent gc

[19:41] <brrt> we can potentially cheapify those by pointer tagging, yes

[19:42] <brrt> but I actually like using the lower bits more than the higher bits

[19:42] <timotimo> oh, they map the same stuff multiple times, just making all variants of a marked pointer valid addresses of the same thing

[19:43] <timotimo> the fun about load barriers is that all our C code will have to have them

[19:43] <timotimo> if we go ahead with making a whole lot more stuff implemented in NQP directly, that'll become easier

[19:43] <timotimo> but still ...

[19:45] <brrt> i'm not clear on what the load barrier actually entails here

[19:46] <timotimo> from the sound of it it'll implement a part of the ZGC's phases, but lazily. perhaps it does something like update the reference that was followed based on a forwarder in the target object if it is to be relocated?

[19:46] <timotimo> or put the reference into a queue of references to be updated?

[19:47] <brrt> so... my PoV on the matter

[19:47] <brrt> GC is an *excellent* reason to implement fork()

[19:47] <timotimo> because killing the child process is the best way to clean up garbage? :)

[19:47] <brrt> yes

[19:47] <brrt> having multiple tiny heaps, is better than one giant heap that we have to do magic to collect fast / with low latency

[19:48] <timotimo> how soon would you think will we need bitmap marking? i.e. moving the mark and seen-in-nursery bits into a separate page?

[19:48] <timotimo> so thatmarking the heap does not cause COW

[19:48] <brrt> never

[19:48] <brrt> preferably :-)

[19:50] <timotimo> oh?

[19:50] <timotimo> oh there's actually a flowchart that shows what has to be done when a load barrier is hit

[19:57] <brrt> oh, I misunderstood

[19:57] <brrt> hmm

[19:57] <timotimo> load barriers will also have to go into the assembly code we generate :)

[19:57] <timotimo> of course split into a fast path and slow path

[19:58] <brrt> I thought you meant pointer tagging with page remapping

[19:58] <brrt> bitmap tagging is actually a pretty nice idea i guess

[19:58] <timotimo> i did mean that

[19:58] <timotimo> oh

[19:58] <timotimo> that's what you confused with that, ok!
