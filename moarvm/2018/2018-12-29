[14:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: On big endian machines, we optimized istrue/isfalse to 0 all the time since

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the least significant bit of lit_i64 is outside the lit_i16 that will be

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: read by the const_i64_16 op. All other optimizations that write a constant

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: seem to correctly write to lit_16.

[15:03] <dogbert11> nine++, is it possible that the other blockers were suffering from the same problem?

[16:24] <nine> dogbert11: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2567 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2564 were both reported on little endian machines, so this bug cannot be the cause

[21:26] <robertle> nine: awesome stuff, I have two questions: a) do you think that the fix to #2563 could be alied on top of 2018.12 alone, or does it require other changes before it?

[21:27] <robertle> b) does this require a rebuild of nqp?

[21:39] <timotimo> if you're refering to the commit last pushed to moar by nine, it should totally apply cleanly to 2018.12 and earlier, and not need any other changes. nqp would not need to be rebuilt

[22:42] <robertle> yeah, I can only imagine how much time has gone into this two-character fix :)

[22:52] <nine> Good thing I'm not payed by character then ;)
