[13:05] <timotimo> jnthn: i tried to come up with a spesh plugin for p6assign to a Proxy, but i think i was still missing some important detail; it looks like what we actually call to invoke the proxy has to have very slightly different arguments, which is why the invokespec has two tiny subs that create a Scalar and call &!FETCH with it

[13:05] <timotimo> got a hot tip for me?

[13:05] <lizmat> .oO( don't go outside now )

[13:06] <timotimo> :)

[13:07] <jnthn> Yeah, it's doing an extra wrapping of the thing I think

[13:07] <timotimo> so my first instinct was to say "build a little closure inside the spesh plugin's run and return that"

[13:07] <timotimo> but i don't think a closure like that is optimizable by spesh then?

[13:07] <jnthn> That can work, especially as we can inline closures

[13:08] <timotimo> i thought we can only do that if it's the outer we inline it into?

[13:08] <jnthn> No

[13:08] <timotimo> or was that the magic trick for "getlexvia"?

[13:08] <jnthn> Can do it more generally

[13:08] <jnthn> Right, the via trick :)

[13:08] <jnthn> That was one of those things where when I thought of it, I wondered why I didn't think of it 2 years beforehand... :)

[13:08] <timotimo> i'll give it a try again, perhaps

[13:09] <timotimo> annoyingly, we mostly emit p6store in typical situations where we have proxies

[14:55] <timotimo> that makes the debugserver less helpful

[14:57] <timotimo> OK, that's interesting. instead of getting the FETCH that i've assigned to the object in the constructor, i apparently resolved Proxy's actual FETCH method instead

[16:44] <brrt> i'm not sure how MVM_LIKELY is compiled

[16:44] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[16:44] <timotimo> no clue. does X86_64 encode branch predictor hints into the assembly implicitly or explicitly?

[16:45] <timotimo> i.e. is gcc flipping the then and else branches around so the more likely one is the one that needs no goto?

[16:45] <jnthn> I at first thought the latter

[16:45] <jnthn> Oh, it may really just be that

[16:45] <jnthn> Watever it does seems to have an effect on instruction count though

[16:46] <timotimo> hm, "instruction fetch" is what valgrind counts, isn't it?

[16:47] <jnthn> Thing so

[16:47] <jnthn> *Think

[16:47] <timotimo> i imagine it perhaps has to do with fetches being not byte-per-byte, but whole cache-lines at once?

[16:47] <timotimo> and if the unlikely then branch starts in the same cache line, it gets fetched, and the likely else branch might start in the middle of the right cache line, too

[16:49] <brrt> hmm, that's cute

[16:58] <brrt> we'd need either a new node, or a node annotation (flags?)

[16:59] <timotimo> probably having a node would be easiest

[17:37] <Kaiepi> thoughts on implementing asm jit support for x32?

[17:48] <brrt> we hate x32

[17:49] * brrt = we, in this case :-P

[17:50] <brrt> I'm going to qualify that a bit better...

[17:50] <brrt> I think when we say x32, we mean the 'run 64 bit code with 32 bit addresses' - and presumably integers as well?

[17:51] <brrt> it's a windows thing iirc

[17:51] <brrt> I actually think that is a pretty sane idea, given how much better x86-64 is than x86

[17:51] <brrt> but, on the other hand....

[17:52] *** nyuszika7h3 joined
[17:52] <brrt> here's my general hypothesis on perl6, adoption, and performance

[17:52] <brrt> there's two places where performance is going to matter for perl6 adoption

[17:52] <brrt> 1): on developer laptops

[17:52] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v nyuszika7h3

[17:53] <brrt> 2): on production servers

[17:53] *** nyuszika7h3 left
[17:53] <brrt> all other platforms, including ARMv7, AArch64, x32, MIPS, PowerPC, whatever

[17:54] <brrt> (production servers are going to have Xeon-style processors, typically virtualized)

[17:54] <brrt> all other platforms don't really matter. Not in this phase of adoption

[17:54] <brrt> if we ever get as big as perl5, then there will be a horde of users clamoring for their obscure platforms. And we'll have a moarvm porters group who will make sure that happens

[17:55] <timotimo> there's also x32 for linux

[17:56] <timotimo> it's also not very difficult for a perl6 program to balloon up to 4 gigs %)

[17:56] <brrt> that, too

[17:57] <brrt> unfortunately

[18:00] <timotimo> brrt: do you think porting the fast path of sp_fastcreate to exprjit will lose us the benefits gained from adding the branch hint macros to the allocate_nursery function?

[18:00] <Kaiepi> so that's a "keep it on the sideburner until later?"

[18:01] <brrt> as far as i'm concerned, yes

[18:01] <brrt> and maybe at that time x32 might no longer be a thing

[18:28] <brrt> hmm. there's the dynasm docs here:  https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/tutorial.html

[18:28] <brrt> I woudl suggest you start playing with that to get a feel for assembly

[18:29] <Kaiepi> aight

[18:29] <Kaiepi> thanks

[18:35] <lucasb> Kaiepi++ I totally encourage that!

[18:36] <brrt> if nothing else you'll learn some things :-)

[18:36] <lucasb> I wouldn't know how to do that. By the time I acquire the skills, the platform will be long gone, and maybe possibly even Earth itself

[18:36] <Kaiepi> it's always good to learn some new things

[18:36] <lucasb> but I can try help Kaiepi :)

[18:36] <brrt> assembly really isn't all that hard though

[18:37] <brrt> there's very few things you have to take into account

[21:17] <jnthn> D'oh, I put beer to the freezer for a bit so it'd be nice and cool, and now I've got iced beer...

[21:46] <timotimo> better than a freezer full of "spicy" beer shards

[21:46] <timotimo> more spiky than spicy, really

[21:46] <timotimo> in german it works better because "scharf" means both "sharp" and "spicy"
