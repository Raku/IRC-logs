[05:08] <samcv> looks less severe since a clean tree will build fine. but will hopefully be able to solve it before release

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Always rebuild minilua to work around issue #999

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This ensures that minilua will always be rebuild. This fixes bug #999,

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: though we may find a better solution.

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We declare ALWAYS_REBUILD as a target, and use the .PHONY property to

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: designate that it's not an actual file (though it's unlikely that file

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: would exist on the users computer). While we're there, also add all the

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: other phony rules like 'install' 'clean' 'lib' etc. as .PHONY so the

[06:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: rules won't break if those files happen to exist in that folder.
