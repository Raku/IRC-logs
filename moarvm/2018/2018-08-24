[15:30] <japhb> Disembarking from a satellite would be quite the event.  I suspect you'd need excellent timing ...

[15:31] *** zakharyas left
[15:35] <TimToady> I had to quickly leave the South Satellite at Seatac earlier this week...

[15:36] <TimToady> fortunately my connection was also delayed due to the incredible pall of smoke rolling down Puget Sound from BC

[15:36] <TimToady> or we woulda missed it

[15:40] <TimToady> we could stare at the orange sun comfortably through the muck, and it was coming from a different country

[15:42] <TimToady> usually the CA at fault this way is the country of California

[15:43] <TimToady> (the other one our president is waging war against...)

[15:44] <TimToady> but I digress, please ignore these satellite remarks...

[19:10] <samcv> maybe should also disable extended attributes too?

[20:14] <diakopter> jnthn: how much of GC time is spent marking? most? some?

[20:23] <jnthn> Well, marking - at least for nursery objects - isn't really marking, it's copying. But I'd guess from various profiles I've looked at it's about two thirds going on that, and around a third on the sweep step after.

[20:34] <diakopter> I wonder if the dual-nursery benefit has been eclipsed by all the other specializations for generations

[20:46] *** khronosschoty19 joined
[20:49] <timotimo> diakopter: how do you mean? we shouldn't have semispace any more, or we shouldn't split young and old gen or what?

[20:49] *** khronosschoty19 left
[20:54] <timotimo> yeah, dual nursery sounds a lot more like semispace

[21:50] <jnthn> I don't think anything has changed much yet in terms of the workload we're putting on the GC. EA will probably make the biggest difference.

[21:56] <diakopter> what's EA :D

[21:57] <timotimo> Escape Analysis

[22:08] <dogbert17> is this a false positive?

[22:09] <dogbert17> Thread 4 bound to an attribute of an object (ThreadPoolScheduler::GeneralWorker) allocated by thread 1

[22:09] <dogbert17>    at SETTING::src/core/ThreadPoolScheduler.pm6:237  (./CORE.setting.moarvm:run-one)

[22:10] <dogbert17>  from SETTING::src/core/ThreadPoolScheduler.pm6:281  (./CORE.setting.moarvm:)

[22:10] <timotimo> yeah, i'd say it is

[22:11] <dogbert17> darn, was hoping it had something to do with 'MoarVM panic: SC index out of range' problem

[22:11] <timotimo> the worker gets created by the thread that owns the TPS, and the worker sets its "working" flag to 1 at the beginning and 0 at the end of every piece of work

[22:12] <dogbert17> aha

[22:13] <dogbert17> will try to figure out another approach then
