[07:57] <masak> is there a good design document on 6model floating around somewhere? or a set of blog posts?

[07:57] <masak> suddenly I have a great thirst for knowing the intricate details about vtables and reprs

[07:57] <samcv> masak: there's stuff in docs/ there might be something useful there

[07:57] <samcv> maybe some blogs but i don't know any on the top of my head

[07:57] <masak> samcv: ta, I'll start there

[08:02] <nine> Note to self: when you look at a hexdump of some MoarVM bytecode and think "ah, of course, it's using the wrong opcode there!" you should probably take a bit of a break...

[08:04] <masak> ah, there's a docs/6model/ directory in the perl6/nqp repo. that looks like a good start.

[08:14] <jnthn> masak: Also read 6model.h, which has the key data structures

[08:23] *** popey19 joined
[08:23] *** popey19 left
[08:25] <nine> All tests successful.

[08:25] <masak> jnthn: ah, d'oh, yes -- I will.

[08:25] <nine> NQP's test suite passes with my MoarVM::BytecodeWriter plugged into assemble_and_load :)

[08:26] <masak> jnthn: ooc, and since you probably know offhand -- has 6model.h gone through any significant change since you designed 6model back in 201*mumble*?

[08:27] <samcv> jnthn: also. so i am now doing what perl 5 does and utf16be and utf16le i pass through a BOM (don't expect one). and on utf16 it removes the BOM if it exists when reading and does encoding detection

[08:27] <samcv> but if we *write* to utf16 then we don't get any BOM. but then again writing to a file never actually worked. but also they both use .encode

[08:28] <samcv> so can we change it so that .encode adds a BOM? or what. or only writing to a file(though that would be more work but maybe i could do it?)

[08:28] <samcv> but i don't like how we can write a file on one perl6 machine and then on another of a different endianess it will read wrong if you try and read it...

[08:35] <jnthn> nine: omg...wow!

[08:36] <jnthn> masak: Not really; the most significant addition was the parametric extensions.

[08:36] <jnthn> samcv: I think we can change it to add the BOM

[08:37] <jnthn> samcv: There's slight back-compat concerns but given we were missing the streaming decoder for it even, well, I think usage was probably quite low :)

[08:37] <jnthn> What does "pass through a BOM" mean exactly?

[08:41] <lizmat> jnthn: I think the main need was to be able to read utf16,  specifically for Text::CSV like applications

[08:42] *** brrt left
[08:42] <jnthn> Righty, what was I going to work on next...

[08:43] <jnthn> ah, the thingy dogbert found...

[08:45] <jnthn> uff, that's a big frame...

[08:51] <samcv> jnthn: well if it has a BOM and you read using utf16le you get zero width no-break space. which is what the standard says and what perl 5 does

[08:51] <samcv> though iconv will drop the BOM assuming it's a BOM

[08:51] <jnthn> Ah, I see

[08:51] <samcv> also should "foo".encode have a BOM? i want to say no

[08:51] *** dogbert2 joined
[08:52] <jnthn> What's the argument for it not having one?

[08:52] <samcv> concatenating strings

[08:52] <samcv> "foo".encode you might not want to write it directly to a file

[08:52] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dogbert2

[08:53] <samcv> since .encode isn't working on a file just a string

[08:53] <dogbert2> o/

[08:53] <jnthn> What will .decode do?

[08:54] <samcv> well probably what it does now. but i guess my point is that .encode is an isolated fragment, while if we write to a file we know that's the start

[08:55] <samcv> i mean if you did $fh.write: "hello".encode('utf16') it's gonna have a bom. but i mean we *could* do that. and just have it documented you should probably do 'utf16le' or utf16be if you're doing fragments

[08:55] <jnthn> Hmm...yeah, that'll be a bit of a trap

[08:56] *** brrt joined
[08:56] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v brrt

[09:02] <lizmat> .oO( claymore )

[09:02] <dogbert2> jnthn: if you get bored with the big frame I can offer a SEGV instead :)

[09:10] <jnthn> I think the problem with the big frame is that it has multiple `return` instructions and we mis-handle that

[09:11] <jnthn> (Produce invalid SSA form)

[09:12] *** Spritz3 joined
[09:12] *** Spritz3 left
[09:13] <jnthn> Since we just rewrite the return instruction into a set to the invoke register, but...if there's two such rewrites both will write the same location

[09:13] <jnthn> Well, same version

[09:13] <jnthn> And then the DU chain checker is rightly upset

[09:14] <jnthn> The only place we code-gen anything of this form is in regexes

[09:14] <jnthn> (at the moment)

[09:19] <dogbert2> is it fixable?

[09:20] <jnthn> Well, the super-easy fix is just to refuse to inline such things, which is easy

[09:20] <jnthn> but...means we can't inline such things :)

[09:20] <dogbert2> which would be a bit sad :)

[09:20] <jnthn> A bit, though it's not super common (otherwise we'd know about it :))

[09:21] <jnthn> Or at least, know about it a lot more :)

[09:21] <brrt> nine++ cool!

[09:21] <jnthn> The proper way to do it is to generate new versions of the target and then insert a PHI

[09:22] <dogbert2> are you leaning towards the latter approach

[09:23] <jnthn> Yeah, think so. It'll only come back as a task to fix a missed opportunity to inline in the future :)

[09:23] <jnthn> The next question after that is how to factor it.

[09:26] <jnthn> I guess a PHI is free (goes away at code-gen time) so we could just always insert it

[09:27] <jnthn> Which is cleaner than trying to keep state around for if we already rewrite a return and patch things up afterwards

[09:47] <dogbert2> it will be interesting to see how postrelease-opts affects [Tux] csv benchmark

[09:55] *** ZzZombo left
[09:57] * jnthn tests the fix

[10:00] <jnthn> It's kinda more elegant this way, because before if there was more than one return then we just didn't try and propagate facts out of the inlinee, whereas now we just let the normal phi facts merge take care of it

[13:23] <nine> The bytecode validation errors seem to occur when there are more than 4685 locals in a frame

[13:33] <[Coke]> cool.

[13:50] <nine> Nah, looks to be more about bytecode size. When I turn the 4685 variables into int typed ones, the bytecode becomes smaller and I can raise the limit. The bytecode size limit is eerily close to 2^16 but it seems to be slightly above that.
