[22:25] <jnthn> The title's a bit of a pain in the butt, though :P

[22:26] <timotimo> it's a pun in the butt

[22:26] <lizmat> depends how you look at it

[22:28] <jnthn> I'm not sure I want to look there :P

[22:28] <timotimo> leave that to your progtologist

[23:14] <MasterDuke> has anyone tried building MoarVM with LTO?

[23:15] <jnthn> Link Time Opt? Ain't that on by default these days?

[23:15] <MasterDuke> oh, you don't need -flto anymore?

[23:15] <jnthn> I'm sure all my MSVC builds were doing that, anyway...I kinda assumed it was happening on gcc/clang too

[23:16] <jnthn> Would be worth checking, but the linking step seems to take long enough that I hope it's doing something useful there :-)

[23:17] <MasterDuke> hm: "Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging information.  Combining -flto with -g is currently experimental and expected to produce unexpected results."

[23:17] <MasterDuke> that's from the 7.3 man page

[23:18] <MasterDuke> 8.1 isn't so scary: "Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging information on systems other than those using a combination of ELF and DWARF."

[23:24] <MasterDuke> oh! adding '-flto' to the CFLAGS makes the build take much longer (all during the "linking libmoar.so" stage). from 30s to 70s

[23:25] *** lizmat joined
[23:29] <geekosaur> well, yes

[23:33] <MasterDuke> hm. one random benchmark was slower using a moar built with -flto

[23:43] <MasterDuke> only very slightly. stage parse of building rakudo seemed exactly the same

[23:44] <geekosaur> I wouldn't actually expect LTO to gain that much for something like moarvm

[23:48] <geekosaur> which is not that there's nothing to gain, but for something like moarvm you're going to need to do better than automatics.

[23:50] <MasterDuke> you mean profile-guilded instead?

[23:50] <MasterDuke> *guided

[23:51] <geekosaur> I mean very careful design, and profiling is only part of it. It's an interpreter; you need to put thought into what and how it interprets

[23:52] <geekosaur> and it will be much more sensitive to memory layout than most code

[23:52] <geekosaur> but a decent amount of *that* might actually have to be at nqp level or higher to be effective

[23:53] <geekosaur> ...or where the effort is actually being put: JIT
