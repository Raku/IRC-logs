[11:53] <dogbert17> o/ would anyone object if I created a PR to get rid of this line: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/gc/collect.c#L265

[12:17] <lizmat> seems pretty harmless, why remove it ?

[12:19] <dogbert17> lizmat: it causes a SEGV :) and to me it's far from obvious what its purpose is, casting an '1' to a pointer

[12:20] <lizmat> then by all means, PR and remove it :)

[12:21] <dogbert17> ok will do, at worst it'll be rejected :-)

[12:36] <timotimo> you know, maybe the intention is actually to cause a segfault there so that the debugger stops on its own

[12:37] <lizmat> would one not document that then, that that is the intention ?

[12:39] <timotimo> *shrug*, maybe the code was too obviously a way to cause a segfault to say that's what it does

[12:39] <timotimo> like, you *can* make 1 a valid address, you just have to map some memory there. you can't do that unless you run the program as root and i don't think anything in moar has any code at all to do such a thing

[12:39] <timotimo> so saying /* cause a segfault */ is like i++ /* increment i by one */

[12:41] <timotimo> i'll remove the code without the need for a PR
