[12:09] <dogbert17> jnthn: I suspect you're quite busy but if you have a second to spare I'm wondering if the ASAN report in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1391 contains enough info for you to figure out what the problem is or if there's anything else I could do to make the bughunt easier?
