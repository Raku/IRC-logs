[03:43] <samcv> AlexDaniel: yeah

[03:44] <samcv> it needs some more refinement, but so far it's somewhat decent

[03:44] <samcv> still need to implement an overview mode or something, and also make it easier to print out the final version

[03:45] <samcv> [829b8ee7] {???} Fix a regression with grapheme segmentation when multiple regional indicators are in the same string | src/strings/nfg.c, src/strings/normalize.c, src/strings/ops.c

[03:45] <samcv> this is fairly nice though, being able to choose which category it is

[03:47] <samcv> and it saves things as a json so maybe we can make it a repository and people can go through it, then push the changes etc

[13:03] <dogbert2> is there something in the CS world called JTT compiler?

[13:03] <dogbert2> or could be a typo for JIT compiler?

[13:04] <dogbert2> *could it

[13:07] <MasterDuke> huh, i would have said it's a typo, but looks like it might actually be a thing

[13:07] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler/src/org.graalvm.compiler.jtt/src/org/graalvm/compiler/jtt

[13:09] <dogbert2> MasterDuke: noted that brrt mentioned JTT in his latest blog post

[13:10] <MasterDuke> ah, but that's a typo

[13:10] <MasterDuke> *bet

[13:11] <dogbert2> I suspected that as well but you answer confused me :)

[13:11] <dogbert2> *your

[13:12] <dogbert2> there a few typos in the text which by the way is very good

[13:13] <dogbert2> it seems as if I'm the one doing the typos atm :(

[13:26] <brrt> ohai

[13:26] <brrt> yes, JTT is a total typo

[13:26] <brrt> good find

[13:26] <brrt> It looks surprisingly like JIT :-)

[13:28] <brrt> I rarely have sooooo many typoes in a blog

[13:28] <brrt> (or not as many people read them)

[13:49] <dogbert2> brrt: what about this - I originally wrote this in a rather confusing way, but the C code was always the *sorter* version

[13:50] <brrt> *shorter* :-(

[14:15] <jnthn> brrt is approaching my blog post typo rate :P

[15:30] * TimToady now imagines intentionally inserting more typos into a blog for the rhetorical purpose of indicating what a passionate hurry your were in to write it... :)

[15:33] <japhb> TimToady: Sadly I think it would instead simply indicate that we use blog software that doesn't spell check ....

[15:47] <brrt> :-D
