[19:04] <timotimo> omit timo

[19:04] <brrt> lol

[19:05] <brrt> I'm kind of out of ideas to hack on ... I'm a bit stuck with the nativeinvoke expr jit

[19:05] <timotimo> i have an idea that's perhaps too "out of reach" for you to try?

[19:06] <timotimo> the idea would be to have a "if we know the STable, we can generate better jit trees for a given op"

[19:07] <timotimo> it's not my idea, nor is it new

[19:07] <timotimo> but it'd be cool to have it some time soon-ish

[19:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v avar

[19:07] <timotimo> having that would allow us to get even bettar than the lego jit currently, especially for the nativeref ops that still have a switch-case for operand size or something after the devirtualization

[19:16] <Zoffix> brrt: do you have the skills to fix R#2400 ? That could be an idea :)

[19:16] <synopsebot> R#2400 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2400 [fudged tests committed][regression][‚ö† blocker ‚ö†] Module Crane is failing tests on HEAD

[19:16] <Zoffix> brrt: basically making failing test pass: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/6c0173886d6352561a609c951f595e78d9b2b292

[19:16] <Zoffix> c: HEAD use lib </home/bisectable/git/whateverable/sandbox>; use Foo; dd foo

[19:16] <committable6> Zoffix, ¬¶HEAD(5c457d9): ¬´Type check failed for return value; expected Hash[Any:D,List:D] but got $(my Any:D %{List:D})‚ê§  in sub foo at /home/bisectable/git/whateverable/sandbox/Foo.pm6 (Foo) line 2‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/og9pgo3xy2 line 1‚ê§‚ê§ ¬´exit code = 1¬ª¬ª

[19:17] <Zoffix> And a very similar bug was fixed recently. Maybe the fix for that gives a hint: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2345#issuecomment-431033154

[19:17] <brrt> timotimo: yeah, that is a good idea. and no, it's not new :-)

[19:17] <brrt> and it's on the list, but it's a biggish project

[19:17] <brrt> well, doesn't have to be a giant project

[19:18] <timotimo> yeah, i'm also afraid it's big

[19:18] <brrt> Zoffix: I'll have a look

[19:18] <brrt> <brag> I'm decently good in breaking big things into small ones </brag>

[19:19] <brrt> But I'm not quite sure how I'd tackle it

[19:25] <brrt> Zoffix: I'm sorry, but I don't even have an idea where to start

[19:26] <AlexDaniel> brrt: I believe in you ‚ô• :)

[19:26] <brrt> hehe

[19:46] <brrt> with some hope I'll be able to make more time for MoarVM soon :-)

[19:56] <Zoffix> Thanks for trying :)

[19:57] <Zoffix> It's kinda scary tho that jnthn being away for a few days kinda leaves us stranded.

[19:58] * Zoffix makes a mental note to git gud at MoarVM in 2019

[20:01] <brrt> this does kind of seem a rakudo issue to me

[20:01] <brrt> but, that's just me

[20:02] <brrt> and I know fairly little about the rakudo compiler

[20:02] <brrt> I mean, for sure, give us segfaults, we can handle those :-D
