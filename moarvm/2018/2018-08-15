[09:09] <jnthn> But asserts ain't included in non-debug/optimized builds, I think?

[09:15] <jnthn> Well, it ain't my point. :P

[09:16] <jnthn> If we're going to do something awful, I'd prefer we do so with a message than can be reported back to us that gives us a hint at what went wrong

[09:18] <brrt> so, my thought was, when that happens users are lost anyway

[09:19] <jnthn> Note that on especially hot paths we do have debugging asserts

[09:19] <jnthn> So it's not that we aren't using them already, just that it's a trade-off between the failure information we can produce and performance

[12:24] <jnthn> (It's exposed by the latest change in postrelease-opts, and there's no known cases of it manifesting in master, but I don't yet know what it is)

[12:32] <jnthn> Ah, apparently lunch helped, I think I mighta found it

[12:37] <timotimo> hooray for lunch!

[12:47] *** zakharyas joined
[12:47] <jnthn> So the set elimination opt can change a guard instruction such that its input and output are different

[12:47] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zakharyas

[12:48] <jnthn> However we always wrote the output register whether or not we deopt'd

[12:48] <jnthn> Changing it so we do that only if we aren't going to deopt fixed things. But it breaks other things.

[12:49] <jnthn> But I've got deopt analysis being done after guard insertion. But guard insertion meddles with the SSA form.

[12:49] <jnthn> Well, not the SSA form, it's still valid

[12:49] <jnthn> But different versions show up either side of the guards

[12:49] <jnthn> I'm wondering if that means deopt analysis coming after guard insertion makes it "too late"

[12:51] <timotimo> optimization ordering again, huh

[12:51] <jnthn> I guess the way to find out is to do 1) a usage pass, 2) deopt pass, 3) facts and guard insertion pass

[12:52] <jnthn> And see if that helps

[12:53] <jnthn> Of course, making the `set` optimization never touch a guard instruction is another option, but that feels like we'll just hit the same problem again in a different opt later on

[13:15] <jnthn> It's not so much optimization ordering as making sure that we get our deopt info gathered early enough and then take great care to honor it

[13:16] <timotimo> OK

[13:16] <jnthn> I'd thought we could get away with doing it a tad later so we could merge a couple of passes

[13:16] <jnthn> I was wrong

[13:16] <jnthn> Now we gather it as early as we possibly could

[15:11] <timotimo> \o/

[15:11] <jnthn> About the Inclusive Allocations

[15:11] <jnthn> For Str it looks like we allocate more per entry after spesh

[15:12] <timotimo> i might have to double-check how that comes to be

[15:12] <timotimo> if i'm properly summing up spesh/jit entries

[15:12] <timotimo> perhaps it barfs if there's some calls with only spesh and some with also jit?

[15:12] <jnthn> Dunno, it just seems odd

[15:13] <timotimo> oh, i probably divide it by the entries to the routine on that page

[15:13] *** lizmat left

[15:57] <jnthn> timotimo: How did your proven guards elimination patch misbehave, ooc?

[16:00] <timotimo> hm, let me try again

[16:00] <jnthn> Well, I've got it applied in my postrelease branch which means on top of various fixes

[16:01] <jnthn> And so far it built NQP and passed tests, built Rakudo and passed tests, and now I'm doing spectest and it doesn't look bad so far

[16:01] <timotimo> right, you want something that used to break so you can compare?

[16:01] <jnthn> Plus I checked the code in a microbenchmark where I expected it to apply and it worked

[16:01] <jnthn> So it's certainly tossing guards

[16:02] <jnthn> ah, I think I just saw one failure in spectest

[16:03] <jnthn> ah, but they both failed before this change

[16:06] <jnthn> ah, one of 'em fails with spesh disabled

[16:06] <jnthn> So it's just a busted spectest I guess

[16:06] <jnthn> The other is a SEGV

[16:07] <timotimo> actually i don't see it fail stuff any more even though i don't have the latest fixes

[16:07] <jnthn> hm, odd :)

[16:07] <timotimo> but maybe that was when i turned guardtype into guardjusttype which the commit i pushed doesn't do?

[16:07] <jnthn> maybe

[16:08] <jnthn> I'll drop that bit for now and clean it up and push it

[16:09] <timotimo> doesn't happen to be this one?

[16:10] <jnthn> No, that's just being behind Rakudo HEAD

[16:10] <timotimo> OK

[16:11] <timotimo> one thing that surprised me was that the post-guarded register seemed to have many more fact flags set than the pre-guarded register

[16:11] <timotimo> wait, was that from a commit that was actually pushed to master?

[16:14] <nine> Oh....the expr JIT template for hllizefor may actually cause a slow down! Unlike the lego JIT version it will always run MVM_hll_get_config_for even if the HLL name is a known values (which it probably is always)

[16:15] <timotimo> right :(

[16:16] <timotimo> i think hll configs might actually be non-moving

[16:16] <timotimo> so you can "just" put the address into an i64 register (hopefully properly truncated on 32bit)

[16:16] <timotimo> and treat it as a pointer on the other end

[16:16] <timotimo> by writing something like sp_hllizefor that takes an extra argument

[16:16] <jnthn> Yeah, they don't move

[16:17] <jnthn> And while you can't put them into a spesh split

[16:17] <jnthn> You could put the true and false into spesh slots

[16:17] <jnthn> And then JIT it into something involving those

[16:17] <timotimo> this is for hllizefor in general i think?

[16:17] <jnthn> With some sp_ternery

[16:17] <jnthn> Oh, I thought for hllboolfor :)

[16:24] <nine> And the template for hllize always calls MVM_hll_current while the Lego JIT version determines the pointer at compile time.

[16:25] <timotimo> that's why we could generate a different instruction that has the current hll in its arguments :)

[16:27] <nine> getcurhllsym just does (let: (($hllname (^getf (cu) MVMCompUnit body.hll_name)))

[16:40] <brrt> .tell nine that's an interesting case for the jit optimizer... I want to make it so that we can use spesh facts that correspond to nodes

[16:40] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to nine.

[16:40] <brrt> and maybe do some constant folding

[16:40] <timotimo> i think we may want to have a bit more extra information

[16:40] <timotimo> because we know for example that anything that hangs off of an STable can be considered constant up to a certain point

[16:41] <timotimo> but how do we encode that in the jit itself?

[16:43] *** lizmat left
[16:47] <brrt> not in the jit, but in the optimizer, that's possible

[16:47] <brrt> anyway, i'll have to think about it some

[16:48] <brrt> timotimo++ interesting post

[16:49] <timotimo> thanks :)

[22:44] <jnthn> 10% off `my $n = 0e0; for ^10_000_000 { $n = $n + 1e1 }; say $n`

[22:55] <jnthn> That's for `my $x = "food"; for ^10_000_000 { $x.tc.flip }` but the code-gen for that is utterly shite

[22:55] <jnthn> But that can be a problem for another day :)

[23:32] <MasterDuke> i set a breakpoint in gdb while compiling an nqp file, is there an easy way to see what line in the file i'm compiling i'm at?

[23:39] <timotimo> MasterDuke: perhaps a start to figuring this otu would be to call MVM_dump_bytecode and see if that gives you a hint

[23:40] <timotimo> i often combine that with looking at a current spesh log

[23:43] <MasterDuke> timotimo: hm. i set a breakpoint in MVM_coerce_smart_numify and then called MVM_dump_bytecode, but nothing jumps out at me

[23:44] <MasterDuke> oh, the the annotations might be helpful...

[23:45] <timotimo> exactly

[23:45] <timotimo> though you could also try manually getting the annotation

[23:46] <MasterDuke> huh, no annotation in this bytecode

[23:47] <timotimo> dump_bytecode doesn't output them i don't think

[23:47] <MasterDuke> i did see them the first time i ran it

[23:49] <MasterDuke> oh, the annotation look like they're pointing to the location of the code that's getting run, not that's being processed

[23:50] <timotimo> processed, eh?

[23:51] <MasterDuke> well, parsed/interpreted/something

[23:52] <timotimo> ah, yes, you would have to inspect the lexicals and such for that to work

[23:52] <timotimo> that'd be a lot easier with the debugserver, bu tit's not made to handle the use case of "code was stopped in gdb, figure it out!"

[23:53] <MasterDuke> yeah, the annotations are pointing to num processing code, which makes sense, but i want to see why that code is being called

[23:53] <MasterDuke> you know, i still haven't used the debugserver yet

[23:53] <MasterDuke> it would help for this?

[23:53] <timotimo> you can find the callers with MVM_dump_bytecode_frame(tc, 1) and higher numbers iirc

[23:54] <timotimo> well, you can use it to navigate the call stack as well as outers of frames and through items and containers and such

[23:54] <MasterDuke> *_bytecode_of or *_bytecode_staticframe?

[23:55] <timotimo> bytecode_of, i think

[23:55] <MasterDuke> oh, i missed _stackframe, that looks like it

[23:57] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit, but thanks, that looks like it'll help
