[00:17] <timotimo> hah, i wanted to show in the blog post how you can get around "method call on native str boxes an object for you" by using, for example, the index sub instead of the index method on Str

[00:17] <timotimo> turns out the implementation of the index sub is currently:

[00:18] <timotimo> multi sub index(Cool $s, Cool $needle, Cool $pos) { $s.index($needle,$pos) }

[02:22] <MasterDuke> timotimo: 'say "Spliting file ...";' doesn't really matter, but should be "Splitting"

[02:22] <geekosaur> "spiting file" :p

[02:27] <MasterDuke> timotimo: "there's also sub forms" should be "there are also sub forms"

[07:28] <brrt> timotimo++ nice post

[07:34] <nine> I just realized that if a NativeCall user often gets strings from the native library just to pass them back to some native code, it simply shouldn't declare the return and arg types as Str but as Pointer.

[07:36] <nine> Whether this is a good strategy for Inline::Perl5 or if it would just optimize for test-ip5xs at the cost to more realistic use cases will be hard to find out unfortunately :/

[07:38] <brrt> hmm

[07:38] <brrt> we assume test-ip5xs is a realistic post?

[07:38] <brrt> eh test

[07:40] <nine> Well it's realistic, but also a micro benchmark.

[09:31] <jnthn> samcv: Please just take them as is and do the release. I think if the changelog is causing this much work/delay we shouldn't bother with it.

[09:31] <samcv> ok, got it

[09:32] <samcv> next releaese i'm going to change the way i do the changelog so hopefully this won't happen again

[09:32] <jnthn> I'm honestly not sure who reads them

[09:32] <samcv> well i read changelogs :)

[09:32] <jnthn> Ah :)

[09:32] <samcv> anyway i must go to bed. have a phone call in the morning about a job

[09:32] <jnthn> Rest well, and good luck with the call :)

[09:32] <samcv> AlexDaniel`: i should release tomorrow then

[09:33] <samcv> night o/

[09:38] <brrt> good night and good luck

[09:38] * brrt is nearly done with the expr compiler refactor

[09:38] <brrt> operand type checking turns out a major pain, because of variadic

[09:48] * brrt grumbles because it turns out that the whole set of 'atkey' templates is wrong

[09:48] <brrt> ... which is why it is good that we have stricter validity checks now

[09:49] <brrt> I might even add carg validity checking at some point

[09:50] <jnthn> Better we find them that way than with crashes and similar

[09:50] <brrt> so the curious thing is... we didn't find them with crashes :-)

[09:53] <nine> The changelog also ends up in the openSUSE RPM packages. But there's also a limit to the number of allowed lines, so a curated changelog makes my life much easier than an unfiltered commit list.

[09:54] * brrt nods

[09:54] <brrt> who volunteers? ;-)

[10:00] <brrt> blegh, core dump

[10:04] <nine> Fun fact: csv-ip5xs.pl does not in fact pass strings it got from the native code back to native code. It reads lines from STDIN and passes those. No idea why I've always thought this different. It's not exactly super obscure code :)

[10:23] <timotimo> what kind of wrong did the atkey templates have? :o

[10:48] <brrt> they had a $0 for the object

[10:49] <brrt> while they needed $1

[10:49] <timotimo> also, i hope you don't just say "nice post" because it's so many words :D

[10:50] * nine doesn't think "nice post" is many words
