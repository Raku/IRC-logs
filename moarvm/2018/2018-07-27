[00:02] <japhb> Sweet!  Reading material for sitting in this awful traffic jam!  (In a bus, that is.)

[00:03] <jnthn> .oO( Sometimes, the bus number is a good sign :P )

[00:04] <MasterDuke> jnthn: fyi if you care, you had a "the a" in the previous post

[00:04] <japhb> Our speed seems to vary a fair amount, but seems to be oscillating between "a slow walk" and "a slow jog"

[00:04] * jnthn tries to figure out if japhb is talking about his bus or about MoarVM :P

[00:04] <japhb> I'm not *that* rude!

[00:05] <japhb> At this pace, I can see all the little bits of flotsam in the median lost out of people's cars (or *off* of, given that some of them are bumpers and tail lights)

[00:11] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Fixed, thanks

[00:14] <MasterDuke> jnthn: "followed by calling whatever the plugin produce.", produces?

[00:14] <jnthn> ah yes

[00:14] <timotimo> jnthn++ # bloggage

[00:16] <MasterDuke> jnthn: in the plugin example, you have `if nqp::isconcrete_nd($rv) && nqp::iscont($rv) { # Guard that it's concrete, ...`. why do you need the guard if you just checked nqp::isconcrete_nd?

[00:18] <timotimo> the guard ends up in the generated code from the plugin

[00:18] <jnthn> MasterDuke: We're setting up guards that should be checked in order to use the specialization that we return

[00:18] <timotimo> yeah, the other checks are not "recorded"

[00:19] <timotimo> i think you neglected to mention that not setting a $!descriptor means "a readonly scalar"

[00:20] <jnthn> Thought about it, but it didn't really fit anywhere, and didn't see that important in the overall story

[00:20] <timotimo> OK

[00:20] <jnthn> *seem

[00:21] <jnthn> I'll be about tomorrow morning, but am off on vacation tomorrow evening and will be offline for a week

[00:22] <jnthn> Well, will glance email, but that's about all

[00:22] <timotimo> aye, vacation time much deserved

[00:22] <MasterDuke> jnthn++ great series of articles

[00:22] <timotimo> agreed, MasterDuke

[00:24] <japhb> Given the timezone difference, I'll just say it now:  Enjoy your vacation, jnthn!

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> jnthn++ indeed

[00:38] <jnthn> japhb: Thanks! :)

[00:39] <jnthn> Glad the series has been of interest :)

[00:45] <jnthn> Sleep time; goodnight o/

[15:51] <timotimo> yo tadzik, how do you feel about my profiler frontend project?

[15:52] <tadzik> timotimo: I'm yet to look into it, but I'm always up for cool profiler frontends :)

[15:52] <timotimo> so far i haven't made the code public, so all you've got is my blog posts and the grant application document

[15:53] <timotimo> (which somehow got rather mangled when going from markdown to movable type)

[16:18] <Zoffix> Join us next week, Saturday, August 4, 2018 for the Monthly SQUASHathon! This month we will be fixing broken ecosystem modules: https://bit.ly/2LUVRdu

[16:25] <samcv> good *

[16:25] <Zoffix> \o

[16:26] <samcv> apparently last night was the hottest night on record in the netherlands

[16:26] <samcv> also the store was sold out of fans :P

[16:51] <timotimo> really entertaining the thought of getting a little "split unit" AC

[16:52] <[Coke]> I lived in houston, tx for 18 months, so I need full-house AC wherever I live now. Spoiled.

[16:53] <[Coke]> 25C? AC!!!!

[16:53] <timotimo> i'm not sure i understand the reason for that, is it just because they have AC running 24/7 no matter the temperature?

[16:53] <tadzik> timotimo: split unit as in, one box inside, one box outside?

[16:54] <[Coke]> timotimo: yes. everything is ac all the time. so you go outside in 40C for 5m, but spend the rest of the day in ac.

[16:55] <timotimo> tadzik: i'd expect one that just has a tube that you hang out the window

[16:55] <[Coke]> well, 35c

[16:55] <tadzik> heh, I'm contemplating the AC at home, but the only time I spent in an AC'd "room" (in a car), I just roll the windows down %)

[16:55] <timotimo> including something to close off the window while it's still open

[16:56] <tadzik> timotimo: ah, the price discouraged me a little bit from that one

[16:56] <tadzik> it'd be cheaper to rent a desk for 2 months around here :P

[16:56] <timotimo> hah

[16:56] <timotimo> can you sleep under the desk? :)

[16:56] <tadzik> night time is mostly fine :)

[16:56] <tadzik> it's working that gets annoying (I work from home)

[16:57] <timotimo> as do i

[16:57] <tadzik> (and I think you can actually sleep under the desk in a cow working centre)

[16:58] <lizmat> highest we've seen today: 36.4

[16:59] <lizmat> last night was the hottest night on record: 23+

[18:48] * japhb is of the opinion it's not truly hot until it crosses 40C, but then he also strongly believes in AC down to at least 22C or below

[18:55] <samcv> lizmat: insulation and double paned windows makes a huge difference as well. my home in california I grew up had those and would feel way cooler than where i'm staying right now

[18:55] <samcv> which has neither

[18:55] <samcv> other times hasn't been much of an issue, but it usually isn't this hot

[18:55] <samcv> in NL that is

[18:56] <samcv> we have no AC at the home i grew up

[18:56] <lizmat> yes, indeed, the heatwave here in Limburg is now in its 21st day, I believe, and the forecast for the next 10 days is not seeing an end of it

[18:56] <lizmat> so that would mean a 30+ day heatwave, which is basically unheard of in NL

[19:08] *** zakharyas joined
[19:10] <samcv> lizmat: apparently right now it's hotter in Limburg than anywhere in europe https://i.redd.it/lmct7bwudgc11.png

[19:11] <lizmat> yeah, we were driving this afternoon, and at one point the car claimed the outside temp was 38

[19:11] <lizmat> so yeah, that feels about right

[19:28] <stmuk> will a newer moarvm generally work with a relatively older rakudo/nqp?

[19:32] <[Coke]> amazing storm rolled through town here just now, wow.

[19:34] <stmuk> we are hoping our 40+ day heatwave gets its first rain in the next 45 mins or so .. thunder and lightening in distance

[19:40] <[Coke]> goodluck.

[19:42] <stmuk> yeah thunderstorm!

[20:13] <MasterDuke> timotimo: you around?

[20:15] <MasterDuke> or anyone really. how do i add something to the string constants structure?

[20:17] <MasterDuke> to add 'Int', like there's 'Str' and 'Num' here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/instance.h#L36-L37

[20:17] <timotimo> MasterDuke: there's a macro that does it

[20:18] <timotimo> MasterDuke: it's in 6model/bootstrap.c
