[04:07] <MasterDuke> has anyone looked at http://www.libtom.net/TomsFastMath/ ?

[04:50] <japhb> MasterDuke: A little worrisome that it doesn't claim truly complete support for original libtommath API, just "fairly complete" and "similar API"

[05:19] <MasterDuke> japhb: true, but there's always the chance that what parts MoarVM uses are supported

[05:43] <japhb> MasterDuke: Likewise true.  :-)
