[11:00] * lucasb stumbled upon Ruby 2.6.0-rc1 announce

[11:00] <lucasb> "Unlike ordinary JIT compilers for other languages, Rubyâ€™s JIT compiler does JIT compilation in a unique way, which prints C code to a disk and spawns common C compiler process to generate native code."

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> again, if anyone has any ideas regarding https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1009, please help

[15:03] <yoleaux> 06:27Z <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I no longer have access to hack.p6c.org

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> the reason I'm mentioning this is because in debian rakudo 2018.11 can't be migrated to testing (because of mips and s390x)

[15:04] <AlexDaniel> with the freezes approaching in the beginning of the next year I want that to be sorted out

[19:47] <timotimo> someone with filesystem access can race you to the compiler reading your sources, right?
