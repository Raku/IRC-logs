[02:19] <samcv> not sure how to fix this. but just spent an hour trying to track down

[02:19] <samcv> "undefined symbol: __asan_option_detect_stack_use_after_return" is what i got. wasted so much time compiling and recompiling and make clean and removing some stray .a and .o files

[02:19] <samcv> but the solution was deleting libmoar.so and moar binary and then make install... i'm not sure why that should change how it installs? does anyone know?

[07:40] <samcv> valgrind and asan are clean, and MVM_dump_backtrace doesn't seem to print anything since tc->cur_frame is NULL, not sure if that is expected or not. and here is a backtrace https://gist.github.com/samcv/73a6a156f5778f072a8c1d2976b129b2

[08:32] <nine> Oddly enough though MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 does not make it more reproducible

[08:33] <timotimo> perhaps dont-gc-in-spesh is a problem

[08:34] <samcv> also with spesh_logit exits with 139

[08:34] <samcv> well after running it many times

[08:34] <timotimo> oh fun i'm not clearing out that one field there

[08:36] <timotimo> oh, wrong, it's in a different struct altogether

[08:37] <timotimo> oh, i was using the spesh alloc for this, ok, so i wasn't in trouble after all

[08:45] <timotimo> but still, it's in spesh_candidate_add

[08:45] <timotimo> it's probably my "retry after aborted inline" mechanism going awry

[08:47] <timotimo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/inline.c#L233 - samcv is there an obvious mistake here? perhaps i'm memcpy-ing wrong?
