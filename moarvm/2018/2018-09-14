[08:50] <brrt> \o

[08:51] <brrt> i've reached the actually messy part of fork-safety - fork()-ing :-)

[08:52] <lizmat> .oO( never run with forks! )

[08:57] <brrt> hmmm

[08:57] <brrt> so here is my worry, right

[08:57] <brrt> - this becomes much simpler if I can assert that the current forking thread is the only thread running

[08:58] <brrt> - but potentially, and i'm not 100% sure this is actually true, but bear with me - the eventloop thread might actually start a new thread before it shuts down due to my signal

[08:59] <brrt> I'm not sure if the eventloop thread actually runs arbitrary MoarVM code

[08:59] *** PanicSkittle10 joined
[08:59] <brrt> so. I can only assert that I have no other threads running, as soon as I have already shut down the spesh and eventloop thread

[09:00] <brrt> And the other thing - the eventloop thread is autovivified

[09:00] <lizmat> brrt: and there is currently no way to stop it, but that could be easily fixed

[09:00] <brrt> I can stop the eventloop thread alright, I'm at that stage

[09:01] <brrt> Hmmm. So I guess I'm saying I must be able to prevent it from being autovivified

[09:01] <lizmat> then we have the worker threads

[09:01] <lizmat> no?

[09:01] <lizmat> why would you?

[09:01] <brrt> during the fork

[09:02] <lizmat> *during* the fork ?

[09:02] <brrt> during the fork process, I need to emulate being single-threaded

[09:02] *** PanicSkittle10 left
[09:02] <brrt> otherwise, I'm going to be left with a mess of an address space in the child

[09:03] <brrt> because the child does not inherit the threads of the parent, only the forking thrad

[09:03] <brrt> *thread

[09:03] <lizmat> ah, so you're saying: it should stop the thread, but *not* lose any queues with things to get done ?

[09:08] <brrt> that, too

[09:09] <brrt> that is actually the nastier of the two bits, because we cons a new uv_loop for every threadcontext.

[09:09] <brrt> actually

[09:10] <brrt> I don't need to destroy the original threadcontext, or the uv_loop_t, if I'm about to restart it

[09:10] <brrt> I kind of want to remove our 'default' uv_loop, since we only ever use it for dirops (I think), and we *never* run it

[09:12] <brrt> but that is another matter for another day

[09:14] <jnthn> brrt: The event loop thread doesn't ever run bytecode

[09:14] <yoleaux> 08:18Z <lizmat> jnthn: I think we need a decoder.reset function, as otherwise we will have to fetch the $!decoder from the $!handle for each .pull-one in the GetLineFast iterator

[09:14] <yoleaux> 08:22Z <lizmat> jnthn: case in point: my $h = open("ten"); for $h.lines { .say; $h.close }

[09:14] <jnthn> It communicates entirely by queues and is entirely C code

[09:15] <jnthn> As for starting it - you can find out if it's already being started as part of the code to stop it, and if you know you're in the only thread that's currently running, you know nothing else can trigger starting of it.

[09:15] <jnthn> So I don't think it's a big issue.

[09:15] <brrt> that's a relief

[09:16] <jnthn> .tel lizmat I'll look at it next week.

[09:16] <jnthn> .tell lizmat I'll look at it next week.

[09:16] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[09:16] <lizmat> jnthn: ok

[09:16] <yoleaux> 09:16Z <jnthn> lizmat: I'll look at it next week.

[09:17] <lizmat> I guess we can live with an LTA error for the time being

[09:28] <lizmat> well, would have been nice to get it into this release

[09:29] <lizmat> but it's not marked as a blocker, so we're good in that sense

[09:33] <AlexDaniel> what's the ticket?
