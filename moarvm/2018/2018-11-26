[17:43] <brrt> ohai #moarvm

[17:43] <yoleaux> 23 Nov 2018 19:18Z <nine> brrt: I sure hope I can help :)

[17:44] <brrt> I can't seem to find the concentration to actually get to work on it :-(

[17:44] <brrt> (it being, the implementation of nativecallinvoke in the expr jit, especially testing that it is correct)

[17:49] <lucasb> is there any way to segfault moarvm on purpose from Perl 6 code?

[17:49] *** lizmat joined
[17:49] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lizmat

[17:50] <lucasb> and if there isn't, can't one exist?

[17:51] <lucasb> I remember seeing this "feature" in some environment/language

[17:52] <japhb> lucasb: Do you want to *actually* segfault, or do you just want to send it sig 11 or so?

[17:52] <lucasb> just for the purposes of learning what a legit segfault looks like in a debubging tool

[17:52] <japhb> Oh, I see.

[17:52] <brrt> write a C program, you'll get one

[17:52] <lucasb> oh, then bind it with Nativecall?

[17:52] <brrt> I'm not sure why you want to hurt moarvm so much

[17:52] <japhb> lucasb: Yeah, it shouldn't be hard to do it with nativecall

[17:53] <brrt> :-P

[17:53] <japhb> brrt: He wants to learn how to debug a segfault.

[17:53] <lucasb> I don't want a standalone C program, I want to segfault from within Perl 6 code

[17:53] <japhb> So cause one and look at the crash in a debugger

[17:53] <brrt> hehe

[17:53] <brrt> well, i'll make one for you, no problem

[17:53] <lucasb> brrt: you will? :-)

[17:55] <brrt> just wait, they'll pop up soon enough

[17:55] <brrt> but we try not to have segfaults. I'm not sure we're right about that, but that's what we do

[17:57] <lucasb> you are not sure moarvm should have *no* segfaults? (Just trying to learn/understand :-)

[18:00] <brrt> well, something like java will not emit checks for null pointers, but translate a segmentation vialotion to a null pointer to a NullPointerException

[18:00] <brrt> that makes the code quite a bit smaller for the common case that a pointer is indeed not null

[18:02] <brrt> there's another school of thought that says all UB is a safety problem. I'm not so sure what my position on that is

[18:02] <lucasb> but a NullPointerException is "catchable", right? (dunno Java)

[18:02] <brrt> yes

[18:02] <brrt> but that's not a problem.

[18:03] <brrt> when a SEGV is raised, and it happens to be caused by access of a null pointer, it is really not all that hard to write a signal handler to catch it and translate to a catchable exception

[18:04] <brrt> I forgot which signals could not be caught, but SIGSEGV is not one of them

[18:05] <lucasb> ah, I remembered where I've seen it: Redis!

[18:05] <lucasb> https://redis.io/commands/debug-segfault

[18:05] <lucasb> DEBUG SEGFAULT performs an invalid memory access that crashes Redis. It is used to simulate bugs during the development.

[18:05] <lucasb> I think this could be useful, can I haz it in moarvm?

[18:07] <brrt> 'no'

[18:08] <timotimo> easy to build a module that does it

[18:08] <brrt> :-P

[18:09] <lucasb> hehe, ok. I'll push this project into my todo list :)

[20:02] <lucasb> What was "s/\n/ /g" before, became "s/\n//g", but maybe pkg-config never outputs more than one line, so probably harmless, otherwise things could get concatenated.
