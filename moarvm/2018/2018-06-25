[16:45] <yoleaux> 13:00Z <AlexDaniel> brrt: well, if you look at https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake/issues/19 you'll see that pretty much every language has its own alternative

[16:45] <yoleaux> 13:01Z <AlexDaniel> brrt: which in many cases is very convenient given that you can write some simple things using *the same language* that you already know
