[07:08] <nine> Kaiepi: your tests are all about wchar_t* and CArray[wchar_t]. With "full support" I mean also being able to pass around a wchar_t as in take_a_character(wchar_t single_char) { ... } or returning one wchar_t

[07:08] <Kaiepi> oh

[07:09] <Kaiepi> passing single wchar_t works

[07:09] <Kaiepi> the issue is CArray[wchar_t] doesn't seem to work

[07:12] <nine> I think your nqp/rakudo changes would help a bit in understanding why (wchar_t does work)

[07:13] <Kaiepi> alright, i'll put up the pullreqs for them

[07:28] <nine> My guess is that you map wchar_t to one of the existing integer types of the appropriate size. That is why we don't need more changes.

[07:29] <nine> same as size_t and ssize_t

[07:29] <Kaiepi> yeah, i do

[07:30] <Kaiepi> it'll be a second before i can get the nqp pullreq up since node's really finicky on my system for testing the js vm

[07:46] <Kaiepi> done

[07:47] *** Ven`` joined
[07:54] <nine> Kaiepi: in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/824#issuecomment-377455405 you didn't allocate any memory for bar

[07:57] <Kaiepi> oh

[07:57] <Kaiepi> lol

[07:59] <samcv> i'm thinking ((INTEGER & 0xffffff80) + 0x80) & (0xffffff80-1) should work the same on big endian as little endian?

[08:00] <nine> samcv: me, too

[08:03] <samcv> cool. i'm super excited now. making collapsing strands 1.5-4x faster should speed up a ton of use cases

[08:03] <samcv> it's probably more like 2-4x actually

[08:05] <nine> samcv: sounds amazing :)

[08:05] <Kaiepi> alright, i got carray to work

[09:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: samcv++ created pull request #830: Speed up collapse_strands 2-4x by full rewrite targeting SIMD optims

[09:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/830

[09:17] <timotimo> now that we use SIMD, we'll potentially have to be careful about our binary packages and compatibility with systems that don't have the required cpu features

[09:17] <samcv> timotimo: well -O3 enables it by default. at least certain ones.

[09:17] <timotimo> right, but if we distribute a package that the compiler put AVX into, it'll crash violently on older machines :)

[09:17] <samcv> some of our loops already did vectorize but not sure how notable any of them are

[09:18] <samcv> so not a new problem, but def something to take into consideration

[09:19] <timotimo> there's surely libraries out there that can help with this problem, for example by runtime cpuid inspection?

[09:19] <samcv> yeah

[09:19] <samcv> i mean ff and chrome both require sse2

[09:19] <timotimo> yeah, ok, sse2 is rather old at this point :D

[09:20] <samcv> so at minimum that seems sane.

[09:20] <samcv> hah

[09:20] <samcv> i'd have to check those loops if i disable some newer ones. i was suprised it did it by itself

[09:21] <samcv> but i guess it's an -O3 thing

[09:21] <timotimo> could be

[09:21] <samcv> or something... compilers are complex

[09:21] <samcv> i wonder what their baseline profile is

[09:21] <timotimo> i used to have -march=native on my configure line for the longest time

[09:22] <timotimo> so it's actually faster to go through the whole string first with can_be_8bit and then doing the copy? rather than doing it in big chunks?

[09:22] <samcv> no clue about chunks. but it's faster even without chunking

[09:23] <timotimo> hm?

[09:23] <samcv> maybe for very very long strings chunking could make sense. that could be done later. but even on ginormous strings the change is much faster

[09:23] <samcv> as in. it checks the whole strand at a time

[09:23] <timotimo> i thought it could be important to go over the same piece of data twice while it's still in the cache

[09:24] <samcv> hm. may or may not be faster

[09:24] <timotimo> my cache seems to be 6 mibs big, i take it your ginormous strings were noticably longer than that?

[09:24] <samcv> yeah

[09:25] <samcv> i guess it's something we could test later. we'd have to start and stop copying many times though. no clue how that would affect it

[09:25] <samcv> i mean you're asking if it'd be faster to check X graphemes to see if they fit in 8 bit. then copy those 8bits

[09:26] <samcv> continue until we're done or we find a section that won't fit in  8bits

[09:26] <samcv> though i'm guessing with most normal size strings there won't be any difference between the two options if it stays in cache

[09:31] <jnthn_> morning o/

[09:31] <samcv> good *

[09:35] <timotimo> can you graph the time it takes to collapse strands of different total sizes and see if there's any point where the characteristics change noticably? that'd be a good indicator for cache-related performance i'd think

[09:35] <samcv> timotimo: if you're curious, clang compiles SSE2, SSE1, AVX BMI2 AVX2 BMI. no clue what it does

[09:38] <timotimo> oh, i think i might have added something to 3rdparty without adding it to LICENSE

[09:39] *** Ven` joined
[09:51] <samcv> jnthn: i can probalby make a static inline function to get the length left in the current strand, but i use the struct's values very extensively since i need the position and the end by themselves as well and i read from the current strand's blob as well

[09:57] <samcv> what is neat is after having worked on this i was able to alter some other loops we have and vectorize those. like the .flip function can vectorize that copying and probably others. not sure where else has code that can be worked to get it vectorized (and has a performance impact enough for it to be worth doing)

[10:00] <jnthn> samcv: Hmmm... I'm a bit sad that having carefully kept the grapheme iterator struct hidden behind a set of (inline) functions to see it poked into, is all

[10:01] <jnthn> It'll only make it harder to do further refactors/improvemnets in the future.

[10:01] <timotimo> hm, it's not enough to copy these values out and write them back when we hand the struct off to another sub?

[10:01] <samcv> i understand your reasoning and agree that is best, but in this case it seems hard to avoid since i'm dealing with offsets of the blobs themselves so i can memcpy from them

[10:17] *** Ven`` joined
[10:19] <dogbert17> o/

[10:22] <jnthn> o/

[10:23] <dogbert17> jnthn: the fixes you made yesterday, do you have them in a branch somewhere?

[10:24] <jnthn> yes, only a local one

[10:24] <jnthn> I've got a bunch of other debugging changes too

[10:25] <jnthn> And didn't yet spectest those other fixes to make sure they're fine

[10:25] <dogbert17> ok

[10:26] <jnthn> samcv: Poking into MVMString isn't my concern - we've always had that as a data structure that stuff under src/strings/ can deal with directly. It's only the gi that I'm thinking about here.

[10:28] <dogbert17> jnthn: first gist of the day, is the one or a false positive :) https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/21d8f4fc1ae488d6fad4ed4b9d9cbe2d

[10:29] <dogbert17> *is it the one

[10:29] <jnthn> Well, that's the eventual place we explode

[10:30] <jnthn> But it turns out instrumenting add_to_worklist to look for this case also spots such a thing

[10:30] <dogbert17> aha, so you're getting closer

[10:31] <jnthn> That it's a use after free or a buffer overrun are both bogus, however

[10:31] <jnthn> Sometimes the junk values just are within such a range that it detects them as such

[10:32] <jnthn> Other times it says it's a wild access, which is more correct#

[10:32] <jnthn> I've eliminated it being STable chaining, which is one of the members of the union where the SC lives

[10:32] <jnthn> That doesn't ever get triggered in this program

[10:32] <jnthn> That means we have something in a gen2 region that somehow has got a forwarder pointer

[10:33] <jnthn> That should never happen

[10:34] <dogbert17> you're working up to a blog post here :)

[10:37] <jnthn> Also, the problem my addition to worklist_add detects is indeed the same bad pointer that shows up later

[10:42] <dogbert17> so where does that bad pointer come from

[10:43] *** Ven`` joined
[10:52] <jnthn> Hm, another alternative is that it's not actually a forwarder, but rather chained in the gen2 freelist

[10:56] <dogbert17> sigh, valgrind really isn't helping here

[10:58] <jnthn> No, I don't think it easily can

[10:58] <jnthn> Nor ASAN

[10:58] <jnthn> Wrong kind of memory problem

[10:58] <dogbert17> I got another error yesterday, in 'pass_work_item', but then I had changed the program under investigation slighly

[10:58] <jnthn> m: say 4244 - 4096

[10:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22421e7e: OUTPUT: «148␤»

[10:59] <jnthn> OK, we're marking something that's on the GC free list. Wow.

[11:00] *** Ven`` joined
[11:08] <jnthn> Finally, something that looks closer to a clue...

[11:08] <jnthn> #0  MVM_panic (exitCode=1,  messageFormat=0x7ffff612b160 "Collectable %p in a gen2 freelist accessed") at src/core/exceptions.c:827

[11:14] <jnthn> Yup, think I got it

[11:15] <jnthn> And it's a silly bug

[11:19] <dogbert17> nice digging. Also agree that many hard to find bugs turn out to be simple mistakes in the end.

[11:21] <jnthn> OK, spectest while I lunch :) bbiab

[11:24] <dogbert17> jnthn++, AlexDaniel will be ecstatic :)

[12:14] <jnthn> grr, spectest fails, but now I realize I'm some way behind master in both NQP and Rakudo

[12:21] <jnthn> Wow, I accidentally had comitted the small nursery and GC debug mode on

[12:21] <jnthn> And it shows up a test failure with native calling

[12:22] <dogbert17> an unexpected bonus problem :)

[12:27] <jnthn> And, thankfully, much easier to fix :)

[12:31] <dogbert17> there might be more of those unless your recent fixes has removed them all

[12:31] <timotimo> whoops, that'll increase performance though when the nursery gets big again :D

[12:32] <lizmat> which commit was that ?

[12:33] <jnthn> A local one that already got rebased with the accidental changes removed :)

[12:33] <timotimo> ooooh

[12:33] <lizmat> ah, ok

[12:33] <jnthn> Just meant that my lunchtime spectest was run under stress setttings rather than normal

[12:33] <lizmat> .oO( getting our hopes up, eh?)

[12:54] <lizmat> time to bump NQP and Rakudo ?

[12:57] <jnthn> Don't mind...I'm running spectest again under the GC stress now, to see if there was anything of interest there or if it was simply me being a bit behind on HEAD

[12:57] <jnthn> hah, see it was done anyway :)

[12:58] <timotimo> wouldn't it be nice if that fixed some of the problems i was seeing with the profiler .. :)

[12:59] <jnthn> Yes. :P

[13:24] <timotimo> oh, huh, the profiler example also explodes violently on master, i thought it was new with my branch

[13:24] <timotimo> well, that makes it more interesting

[13:27] <lizmat> hmmm... I got a hang on t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t on the last test just now, haven't seen that in a long time

[13:28] <lizmat> can't reproduce it :-

[13:28] <lizmat> (

[13:28] <jnthn> I can

[13:28] <jnthn> With GC stressing

[13:28] <jnthn> Also taking that test out of the spectest file and running on its own also hangs quickly in such a way

[13:28] <jnthn> (That's what I've been working on for the last 30 mins or so)

[13:28] <lizmat> ok, so *I* don't need to worry about it right now

[13:29] <jnthn> It's something about Supplier::Preserving, it seems

[13:29] <jnthn> urgh, yes

[13:29] <lizmat> well, I'm working on ThreadPoolScheduler.cue for the common case   ( .use { }, :catch )

[13:30] <jnthn> nice :)

[13:30] <lizmat> makes it about 5x as fast for the common case

[13:31] <jnthn> Goodness, that's a bit

[13:31] <lizmat> and about 25% fewer allocations

[13:31] <lizmat> yeah, lot's of named parameters that we don't use in most cases

[13:32] <lizmat> but it seems I borked the non-common cases

[13:32] <lizmat> will look at that after I get back from some cycling&

[13:32] <jnthn> Enjoy

[13:33] <jnthn> Yeah, the problem is seemingly that Supplier::Preserving's reply mode will emit under a blocking rather than async lock

[13:34] <jnthn> And that test depends on cooperation

[13:34] <jnthn> But it's not clear at all that it's so simple as "just change the type of the lock"

[13:35] <jnthn> No, that actually makes it worse :)

[13:53] <dogbert17> I ran his testsuite several times, no SEGV

[13:53] <jnthn> Cool!

[17:35] <timotimo> this small enough?

[17:37] <timotimo> ah, yes, i do get the crash on master

[17:42] <timotimo> i don't get any output of my thing triggering

[17:51] <timotimo> what's wrong with my signalling ...

[17:52] <dogbert17> signalable6: what is timotimo doing wrong

[17:52] <dogbert17> :)

[17:54] <timotimo> any other files that trigger that crash?

[17:56] <dogbert17> there used to be, let me think ...

[18:01] <dogbert17> hmm, can't seem to find it, grr

[18:04] <timotimo> oh, the code is still wrong, as it doesn't properly mark the scs before trying to resolve the objects, heh.

[18:09] <timotimo> gah, i hate how MVMROOT messes up gdb

[18:15] <timotimo> ok, it does happen, it runs, it seems to be good

[18:43] <mojca1> Does anyone have any idea what could go wrong in https://trac.macports.org/ticket/56190 ?

[18:43] <mojca1> It's strange that MoarVM built correctly on our CI, including Mac OS X 10.5/ppc

[18:43] <timotimo> oh damn!

[18:44] <timotimo> huh? but i did mark it MVM_PUBLIC

[18:53] <mojca1> It compiled for all our systems on the CI (10.5, 10.6 … 10.13), I don't actually know how to reproduce it (not that I have 10.12 at disposal)

[18:54] <timotimo> if someone can reproduce it, it'd be nice to have the makefile and all the flags that were passed to the compiler

[18:56] <mojca1> I asked the reporter to file a ticket and then provide more info on request, I cannot really help if it's not obvious how

[18:56] <mojca1> he was using an external drive apparently, but I don't know if that makes any difference

[18:57] <mojca1> thank you

[19:31] <Kaiepi> why are the mux inside the loop instead of outside here? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/syncfile.c#L143

[19:45] <jnthn> Kaiepi: Probably they don't need to be, though I guess EINTR is rare enough that it matters little

[19:46] <jnthn> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/syncfile.c#L73 has them outside such a loop, for example

[19:58] <dogbert17> jnthn: do you think that one of your fixes today nailed https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/777 ?

[19:59] <jnthn> dogbert17: yes

[20:00] *** Kaiepi joined
[20:01] <dogbert17> guess we can close it then given that it was the tests which uncovered the problem :)

[20:02] <jnthn> yay :)

[20:03] *** Kaiepi joined
[20:03] <dogbert17> done :)

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Stress testing of t/04-nativecall/11-cpp.t showed that the same fix

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: had to be applied to CPPStruct as well.

[20:08] <dogbert17> I found one item which still seems a bit buggy: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/e1007f3bca43bac70209d331d9f85422

[20:09] <dogbert17> when retesting https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/728

[20:11] <dogbert17> when ASAN gets grumpy it's always on test #26

[20:44] <samcv> timotimo: regarding whether loops vectorize or not. we can use #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable) interleave(enable) and set a clang option to warn (or it may warn actualy by default if it fails in vectorizing)

[20:53] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:52] <MasterDuke> samcv: what does gcc do with the loops?

[22:07] <samcv> it probably vectorizes them

[22:10] <samcv> also i just tested. it still vectorizes even if i only let it uses sse1 and sse2

[22:10] <MasterDuke> in clang or gcc?

[22:10] <samcv> clang

[22:13] <samcv> i am checking now though

[22:16] <samcv> ack sadly it seems to not be vectorizing them. though the changes are still slightly faster than what we were doing before if there's no vectorization

[22:16] <MasterDuke> any way to hint them

[22:17] <samcv> i'm trying to figure that out now

[22:23] <samcv> src/strings/ops.c:276:23: note: not consecutive access *_18 = _26;

[22:23] <samcv> what... it's totally consecutive

[22:23] <samcv> result8[result_pos++] = active_blob[i++];

[22:25] <samcv> maybe it's not unrolling any loops?
