[18:42] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: patzim++ created pull request #973: Remove som dead code.

[18:42] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/973

[18:43] <sandinmyjoints_> Iâ€™m working on an experimental programming language that is heavy on Unicode string operations, and from what I can tell MoarVM supports a lot of what I envisioned for the language runtime, such as including the Unicode database

[18:45] <sandinmyjoints_> And using graphemes clusters as a unit.

[18:46] <moritz> sounds about right

[18:46] <lizmat> sandinmyjoints_: perhaps this could be of use to you: https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course

[18:46] <sandinmyjoints_> Iâ€™m wondering what it would take to use moar as a compilation target. I see that it has bytecode, so that seems good.

[18:46] <sandinmyjoints_> But is it tied to closely to perl6 to make sense as a target for another language?

[18:47] <moritz> are you planning to make it a statically typed language?

[18:47] <sandinmyjoints_> Thanks lizmat

[18:48] <jnthn> Well, it exists primarily to serve Perl 6, but provided what you want to do is covered by the (quite wide) range of available features...

[18:48] <sandinmyjoints_> moritz: I wasnâ€™t, but itâ€™s very early days so Iâ€™m not necessarily committed to that.

[18:48] <jnthn> We keep a pretty clean interface between the Perl 6 compiler and the VM, though, to help us manage the complexity of it all.

[18:48] <sandinmyjoints_> I almost certainly will write an interpreter in p6

[18:49] <moritz> you could write it in NQP

[18:49] <moritz> that's a bit lower-level, closer to the metal, and more performant

[18:49] <moritz> but quite expressive enough to write a compiler in it

[18:49] <sandinmyjoints_> I was wondering about that â€” what would be the advantages of sticking to nqp?

[18:49] <sandinmyjoints_> Ok

[18:51] <jnthn> Largely that the compiler authoring tools are written in NQP, so a bit more easily used from there.

[18:56] <sandinmyjoints_> Oh cool

[18:57] <sandinmyjoints_> Iâ€™m guessing the answer is no, but is anyone aware of any other languages using targeting moar besides p6 and nqp?

[18:58] *** dalek left
[18:58] *** dalek joined
[18:59] <sandinmyjoints_> Is there a roadmap or process for how moar handles Unicode releases? I think I saw somewhere that it includes version 9, though Iâ€™m not sure when that doc was written.

[19:11] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure if it's in there now, but ISTR some talk of putting the unicode version in

[19:16] <sandinmyjoints_> MasterDuke: thanks for the info. Putting the Unicode version in seems useful! +1 to that.

[19:23] <sandinmyjoints_> lizmat: thanks, good to know. Unicode 10 was released in June, maybe itâ€™s in moar now. If I were at a computer instead of on a phone Iâ€™d check ðŸ™‚

[21:41] <sandinmyjoints_> lizmat: wow, that nqp intervals course you linked above is fascinating! Iâ€™m new to making PLs and not very experienced with Perl (have come across it here and there in a decade of software engineering but never used it for anything substantial), and I had no idea that Perl had grammars built into the language. Itâ€™s a language for making languages. Seems very promising for building my first interpreter than

[21:41] <lizmat> sandinmyjoints_: that's NQP, aka Not Quite Perl

[21:41] <sandinmyjoints_> Can skip a bunch of scanning code and go right into the good stuff

[21:41] <lizmat> :-)

[21:41] <sandinmyjoints_> Oh right.

[21:41] <lizmat> and it's meant to build Perl 6 with, not Perl 5 (yet anyway :-)

[21:42] <sandinmyjoints_> Maybe I read it wrong, but it sounded like grammars are in Perl 6 as well as nqp?

[21:42] <lizmat> yes, they are very much a part of Perl 6

[21:42] <sandinmyjoints_> Either way, youâ€™re right that nqp is whatâ€™s looking promising to me

[21:43] <lizmat> but the grammar of Perl 6 is written in mostly NQP

[21:44] <sandinmyjoints_> In fact, from what I can tell in those slides, I wonâ€™t miss a lot of what nqp leaves out from p6. Seems like a lot of sugar and implicit stuff that I wonâ€™t miss if I never expected it in the first place...

[21:45] <geekosaur> but perl 6 gives you soem stability; nobody guarantess the nqp interface or apis

[21:47] <geekosaur> and some of the things you get at p6 level aren't necessarily obvious. you'd need to be specific about types, nqp doesn't figure that out for you

[21:47] <geekosaur> like, go look at all the nqp::add_* variants

[21:47] <lizmat> sandinmyjoints_: yeah, NQP is much closer to the metal

[21:48] <lizmat> sandinmyjoints_: so I guess you need to make a performance / ease of implementation decisiom

[21:48] <lizmat> *decision

[21:52] <sandinmyjoints_> I see. Performance is decidedly not a goal for me at this point, so it seems like p6 may be a better choice

[21:53] <lizmat> yes, I would concur...

[21:53] <lizmat> in the mean time, Perl 6 is getting faster and faster

[21:53] <lizmat> except for grammars atm :-(

[21:54] <sandinmyjoints_> It will probably be fast st those before I ever get to the stage where Iâ€™m optimizing for perf :)

[21:54] <lizmat> but if, as you said, performance is not an immediate goal, then you should be fine
