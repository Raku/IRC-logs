[08:41] <nine> .ask jnthn The NativeCall JIT issue reported in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2036 goes away when run with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1. Setting MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 only makes the issue appear earlier (after ~260 iterations instead of ~14000). Also in every test run there's only a single iteration giving a wrong result. Do you concur that this sounds very much like an OSR issue?

[08:41] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[08:45] <nine> .ask jnthn JIT compiled native calls with rw arguments are the only code that uses the getarg_i OP (for reading back the modified value from the arg buffer). Maybe OSR is not treating that correctly?

[08:45] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[12:13] <timotimo> nine: you think perhaps something's b0rked in spesh/args.c?

[12:19] <lizmat> timotimo: did you happen to follow developments on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2138 ?

[12:22] <timotimo> not sure about the QAST::WVal vs Var thing, but have you looked at the compile_time_value method and such?

[12:23] <lizmat> afaik, QAST::Var doesn't have a compile_time_value method ?

[12:23] <timotimo> i don't remember clearly how the compile time value stuff works

[12:23] * lizmat tries

[12:25] <timotimo> i've had really bad sleep; a combination of "too warm" and "the cat was terrorizing me more than half the night"

[12:26] <timotimo> so don't expect too much from me in the near future %)

[12:27] <lizmat> timotimo: :-(   feel better soon!

[12:27] <timotimo> i'll try!

[20:43] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix typo that prevented MVM_GC_DEBUGging bindlex

[20:43] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/647fcb9f2a

[20:49] <MasterDuke> can a #define work if there's a space between the '#' and the 'define'? e.g., `# define x y`

[20:49] <timotimo> yes

[20:50] <MasterDuke> good

[20:50] <MasterDuke> btw, what were you expecting GC_DEBUG to tell us? i never saw any difference in behavior or output

[20:51] <timotimo> oh?

[20:51] <timotimo> it should give us errors as soon as something bogus is assigned somewhere

[20:51] <timotimo> instead of when the next GC runs happens to stumble upon it

[20:52] <MasterDuke> hm. i had tried with it just set to 1, now trying 2

[20:52] <MasterDuke> just printed to stderr?

[20:53] <timotimo> i think it'll panic

[20:56] <MasterDuke> no panic, just segfaults

[21:01] <timotimo> 367        MVM_gc_worklist_add(tc, worklist, &(tc->instance->all_scs[sc_idx]->sc));

[21:01] <timotimo> (gdb) print sc_idx

[21:01] <timotimo> $2 = 53606176
