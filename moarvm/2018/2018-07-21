[10:37] <timotimo> jnthn: in order to make Tap more easily subclassable, the slow path may want to also take *%foo and pass it on to self.bless

[12:02] <Kaypie> what am i doing wrong here? https://hastebin.com/sarusikuco.php

[12:02] <Kaypie> i'm trying to make it so the file descriptor can be passed back to the callback that nqp::asyncconnect's given, but i get Too few positionals passed; expected 7 arguments but got 6 when i try to run it

[12:03] *** Ven`` joined
[12:04] <jnthn> Kaypie: That looks correct, unless you missed a place somewhere, or updated the wrong thing in Rakudo...what does your Rakudo diff look like?

[12:04] <jnthn> Kaypie: Also, did you make install MoarVM so that Rakudo is using your changed one?

[12:05] <jnthn> I don't see anything wrong with the patch

[12:05] <Kaypie> it looks like this https://hastebin.com/abumoyehuv.rb

[12:05] <Kaypie> and it should be installed, but i'll double check

[12:10] <Kaypie> ah i forgot the prefix when i configured moar

[12:12] <jnthn> aha :)

[12:12] <jnthn> Yeah, the Rakudo side of the patch looks sensible too

[12:12] <Kaypie> the fd being -1 when i test isn't very helpful, though

[12:13] <Kaypie> oh wait i was still using nqp::filenofh in the test file

[12:31] <timotimo> whoops

[12:32] <timotimo> on JVM the order of peerhost/peerport and sockethost/socketport is switched, i.e. what you think is the remote address is now your local address

[12:34] <timotimo> also, the failed callback for async listen doesn't push the four arguments for the hosts/ports, so it would probably not work
