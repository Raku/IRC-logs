[16:47] <dogbert17> hmm, the --profile option can still generate humungous profiles

[16:48] <timotimo> yes, the fix for the inlining problem hasn't landed yet because it's also crashy

[16:51] <dogbert17> aha, any theories as to why it's crashy?

[16:52] <timotimo> the code isn't getting the right inlines; nine's work on uninlining backtraces will be re-usable here, and i think he's gotten farther than i have

[16:56] <dogbert17> cool

[17:29] <dogbert17> heh, a coredump

[17:45] <dogbert17> timotimo: what do you make of this? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/95d345c70342c79c66d7bad6526e0b3b

[17:46] <timotimo> good old memory corruption?

[17:48] <dogbert17> valgrind doesn't say anything if I turn off FSA_SIZE_DEBUG

[17:49] <timotimo> oh, maybe it's a bug in fsa_size_debug?

[17:50] <dogbert17> perhaps we're not supposed to use that flag anymore?

[17:51] <timotimo> if devs haven't kept it on recently, it could have bitrotted a little?

[17:51] <timotimo> things that violate the fsa size debug can lead to real crashes, so it should be kept in good repair

[17:51] <dogbert17> haven't used it for a while but nwc10 found a bug in nqp recently

[17:53] <nwc10> this is chance, but I happened to have this window open

[17:53] <nwc10> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/577152

[17:53] <nwc10> 3 NQP regression tests fail under ASAN when MoarVM is built with FSA_SIZE_DEBUG

[17:53] <timotimo> this could be fate!

[17:54] <nwc10> t/p5regex/01-p5regex.t t/qregex/01-qregex.t t/serialization/01-basic.t

[17:54] <nwc10> no, I don't know when this first started

[17:55] <dogbert17> uh oh, I hope AlexDaniel doesn't see this :)

[17:55] <AlexDaniel> o_o

[17:55] <dogbert17> I turned on the flag again and used ASAN, now it complains earlier: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/458d1bcda42c8d253fd7a5bea437fd1c

[21:25] <dogbert17> the problem seems to have surfaced after 2018.03
