[12:04] <brrt> I have a theory wrt to my fork problem. It is called 'MVMROOT'

[12:17] <brrt> ... the instance->threads object is moved, but not forwarded

[12:17] <brrt> well, not updated, I should say

[12:20] <brrt> yes. instance->threads is not updated

[12:20] <brrt> hmmm

[12:23] <patrickb> brrt: Out of curiosity, what can one do with a fork-safe MoarVM? ("Forking!" - Duh. But why should I?)

[12:38] <diakopter> decades ago it was a slick way to "pre-fork" handlers of http requests without having to worry about insecurity or instability (or total lack) of memory-sharing threads

[12:41] <brrt> forking, that's basically it

[12:42] <brrt> patrickb: you can make the case that with async IO, 'real' threads etc. that fork() is no longer necessary

[12:42] <brrt> I don't believe that argument.

[12:43] <brrt> fork() is an *excellent* way to add adhoc concurrency / parallelism

[12:43] <patrickb> so the idea is to provide a way to do a real fork() from within perl6 itself?

[12:43] <brrt> I find that if you want to use threads, you'd better design that from the outset

[12:43] <brrt> yes

[12:45] <brrt> fork() is also well suited for things like online replacement of daemons

[12:45] <brrt> I know that nobody does that anymore because docker...

[12:48] <brrt> I forgot what the name was for the process, where you replace on daemon with another

[12:50] <patrickb> Makes sense. Thanks for the elaboration!

[12:50] <brrt> :-)

[12:51] <brrt> (I mean, I'm fully aware that this is a fools errand... but that's why it's open source, I guess)

[12:52] * brrt recalls the situation at a $previous-employer where I'd suggest to 'just fork and write to a pipe' and got stares of confusion

[12:52] <lizmat> .oO( build impossible programs :-)

[17:28] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Rather than doing it for each of the parameter instructions. This lets

[17:28] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: us log parameter types even when their target will be a slurpy, meaning

[17:28] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: we can make a type specialization rather than a certain specialization

[17:28] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: for calls to things taking slurpy parameters. This helps, among likely

[17:28] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: quite a few things, calls like `.new(x => 1, y => 2)` for the standard

[17:29] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: `new` constructor: when the `BUILDALL` is small enough, it can now be

[17:30] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: set the "it's decontainerized" flag, so this is not only a cleanup,
