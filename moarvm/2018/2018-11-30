[07:41] <ItchyPlant> Hello

[07:41] <ItchyPlant> Some hours ago the MoarVM/NQP/Rakudo 2018.11 packages were released, which is great, and I'd like to try them too on AIX 7.2.

[07:42] <ItchyPlant> While 2018.10 could be compiled the same way as I succeded with 2018.09, now this new one fails at MoarVM part:

[07:42] <ItchyPlant> https://gist.github.com/ItchyPlant/114c0ca6dda760a60d28e217906ccafb

[07:43] <ItchyPlant> make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'atomic_ops/sysdeps/loadstore/acquire_release_volatile.template', needed by 'atomic_ops/sysdeps/loadstore/acquire_release_volatile.h'. Stop.

[07:51] <samcv> hey ItchyPlant

[07:52] <samcv> side note. this wasn't able to get into the newest release https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1004

[07:52] <samcv> i did some work to try and get things compiling on aix. but i haven't tested it myself

[07:53] <samcv> gonna merge that now

[07:53] <samcv> ItchyPlant, though what you just mentioned seems unrelated

[07:55] <ItchyPlant> yes, this is something new

[07:56] <samcv> hmm since libatomic wasn't updated i don't think

[07:56] <ItchyPlant> I wrote all my experience with previous two versions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9s2v1o/perl_6_201809_on_aix7/

[07:56] <samcv> yeah i read that :)

[07:56] <samcv> which prompted my changes which i just merged

[07:58] <samcv> can you show me your 3rdparty/libatomicops/src/Makefile

[07:58] <ItchyPlant> I'm glad it had some values. :)

[07:58] <ItchyPlant> sure, moment...

[08:00] <ItchyPlant> https://gist.github.com/ItchyPlant/9970f2443ec19b343aa0f45b3c92eb3f

[08:02] <samcv> ItchyPlant, ok can you give me the output of `makefile -n` in the main MoarVM directory

[08:07] <ItchyPlant> you mean 'make -n' I guess

[08:07] <samcv> oh. yes :)

[08:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[08:08] <samcv> oh. does `make -n` not do anything hmm

[08:08] <samcv> let me check the aix make manual

[08:11] <samcv> well hat's weird. it printed some stuff. but also ran some commands

[08:11] <samcv> -n usually just prints command it would run and not run any of them

[08:21] <samcv> ItchyPlant, are you using a clean working tree?

[08:21] <samcv> or did you update moarvm using git

[08:22] <ItchyPlant> this is GNU make, not the IBM one but yes, --help for make says "-n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon  Don't actually run any recipe; just print them."

[08:22] <ItchyPlant> yes, it is a clean, just extracted MoarVM-2018.11 package

[08:23] <samcv> ok

[08:30] <samcv> ItchyPlant, i'm not sure what's going on yet. and need to go to sleep soon

[08:31] <samcv> could you make a moarvm issue which links to the outputs you have linked to me so far?

[08:31] <samcv> `make` output and `make -n`

[08:31] <samcv> oh also the generated Makefile in that folder

[08:36] <ItchyPlant> doing it...

[08:37] <samcv> ok great

[08:37] <ItchyPlant> thank you

[08:38] <ItchyPlant> good night :)

[10:47] <jnthn> Well, OK, it does with my local patches that actually use this stuff :)

[10:49] <jnthn> Now need to handle merge of this info during inline.

[15:24] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/pea:

[15:24] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/pea: Otherwise, we end up with incomplete and wrong information in the

[15:24] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/pea: bogus.

[15:24] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/pea: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5cc493f340

[15:25] <jnthn> dogbert11: Hard to say in general, but it's certainly able to do optimizations - especially in combination with a Rakudo branch that does more aggressive lexical to local lowering - that eliminate some allocations, yes.

[15:26] <jnthn> dogbert11: Still lots to do in terms of making the optimization cover more cases, though before that would come making it correctly handle deopt, which is what I'm working on at the moment.

[15:26] <jnthn> Once it can handle *that*, and the Rakudo branch that makes this more useful can be merged, then this is probably sensible to merge.

[15:28] <dogbert11> cool, timotimo explained a bit yesterday about the 'partial' part in pea

[15:30] <dogbert11> I guess your deopt logic is for that
