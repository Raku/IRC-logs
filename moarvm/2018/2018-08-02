[01:02] <MasterDuke> re https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2158, reverting https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/631 fixes it, but i'm not sure why

[01:04] <MasterDuke> if i stick an fprintf of nread here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/procops.c#L554 i get ~15 prints of values ranging between 128 and 2048

[01:05] <MasterDuke> if i revert 631 and put the fprintf in i get3 prints of 4096, 4096, and 3590

[02:49] <samcv> .tell lizmat yes, doing that should not be broken. Only adding keys changes the iteration order, deleting retains order. it's just adding things that is a pretty bad idea

[09:33] <nwc10> this might be a few days old

[09:33] <nwc10> "nous sommes en vacances"

[10:59] <timotimo> is "nous" the plural of "no u"?

[14:59] <MasterDuke> xelak: huh, i have no idea what that variable is, but yeah, that does look suspicious
