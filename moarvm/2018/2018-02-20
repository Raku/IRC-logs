[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Add an nqp::tryfindmethod

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Which evaluates to nqp::null in the event that the method cannot be

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: found. This will allow things that do nqp::can + nqp::findmethod to

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: avoid the double-resolution. While sometimes spesh can do that, this

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: can give better baseline performance before optimization and avoid a

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: double-lookup in the unoptimizable mega-morphic case.

[12:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b39fa0ec41

[12:18] <jnthn> Seems that just using that in !reduce gets 3% off a JSON::Tiny benchmark

[12:20] <dogbert17> jnthn: back to optimizing ?

[12:22] <timotimo> my next opt may be to make all atkey on getenvhash constant-folded at spesh time, so we can put debug code guarded by getenvhash()<foo> everywhere with what i'm hoping would be a very minor performance impact

[12:25] <dogbert17> moar speed is never a bad thing :-)

[13:09] <jnthn> dogbert17: Yeah, figured I'd do a little bit on regex-y stuff

[13:17] <dogbert17> I guess that there are a few opportunities there

[13:20] <dogbert17> m: use nqp; ((" " x 5000) ~ "end") ~~ / \s+$ /; say now - INIT now # are you after stuff like this ?

[13:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16b57af54: OUTPUT: «2.7869513␤»

[13:25] <jnthn> Potentially, yes :)

[13:26] <dogbert17> cool

[13:26] <timotimo> m: use nqp; say (" " x 5000).chars; say now - INIT now

[13:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16b57af54: OUTPUT: «5000␤0.0019839␤»

[13:26] <timotimo> m: use nqp; say (" " x 5000 ~ "end").chars; say now - INIT now

[13:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16b57af54: OUTPUT: «5003␤0.00195658␤»

[13:26] <timotimo> ok

[13:27] <dogbert17> [14:11] <timotimo> our regex optimizer is dumb as bricks ;) # quote taken from RT #128693 :-)

[13:27] <synopsebot> RT#128693 [new]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128693 [PERF] Regex optimizer on \s+$ is "dumb as bricks"

[13:27] <timotimo> m)

[13:28] <timotimo> maybe it should have been "as sharp as a brick"? or maybe "as sharp as a wet sponge"

[13:28] <lizmat> .oO( brought to sleep by hypnosis? )

[13:28] <timotimo> hey lizmat, i hope your sickness subsides soon :)

[13:29] <lizmat> getting a little better every day

[13:29] <lizmat> feeling up to doing stupid commits now  :-)

[13:29] <dogbert17> :-)

[13:29] <timotimo> awesome!

[13:29] <timotimo> we just had the release, so there's like 4 weeks for others to find problems in what we commit now :D

[13:31] <jnthn> Yeah, that's why I started committing again today :P

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Add ops for strict decoding of windows-1251/1252

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: We have new versions of `encode`, `decode`, and `encoderep` that allow

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: a new config flag. These ops differ from the previous encode/decode

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: ops in that by default they decode using strict rather than permissive

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: methods. They throw on encountering a codepoint that is not mapped in

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the standard and optionally will decode permissively.

[22:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/314c523fe5

[22:25] <samcv> jnthn: can you look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/799 i'm thinking of merging it

[22:26] <samcv> should make it much easier to maintain libatomic_ops because it started with the actual libatomic_ops repo, checked out the newest version that we had bumped to (years ago). then merged in our libatomic ops (separated only that folder as its own repo and merged into libatomic's repo at that version)

[22:27] <samcv> then once that merged, i think merged it again at libatomic_ops's latest release with our current version

[22:27] <samcv> which was a pain but will avoid pains in the future I am hoping

[22:44] <jnthn> samcv: Hm, that sounds very good in principle :)

[22:44] <jnthn> Ah, the diff is huge 'cus it's got the whole removal of libatomicops :)

[22:44] <samcv> yeah

[22:45] <samcv> i know we had issues before where we removed a submodule? right? and turned it ito our own directory?

[22:45] <samcv> i tested though and you can pull and it will remove libatomicops dir and put the submodule there instead

[22:45] <samcv> only issues seems to be going backwards

[22:45] <samcv> so shouldn't have issues with things that pull and autobuild

[22:46] <jnthn> Yeah, there was some problem along those lines

[22:46] <jnthn> Well, one sure-fire way to avoid it is to put the submodule into a differently named directory :)

[22:47] <samcv> heh
