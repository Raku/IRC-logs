[13:41] <nine> 13.7s!

[13:43] <timotimo> i don't have the comparison numbers available, nine :(

[14:11] <nine> Last number I reported was 14.8. I started out at around 23s and the target is < 12.5s

[14:33] <timotimo> nice.

[14:34] <timotimo> i wonder what you did, but i probably don't have enough context to understand an explanation

[14:39] <lizmat> grr... wanted to create a PR :-(

[14:43] <lizmat> yeah, nqp builds fine

[15:00] <nine> Fun fact: during stage parse alone we resize bytecode buffers ~ half a million times. I had no idea we do so much compilation during compilation

[15:01] <nine> A further 300K resizes during stage optimize

[15:01] <nine> And only 300K more during the actual stage mast

[16:22] *** ggoebel left
[16:34] <nine> Pre-sizing the string buffers cuts that down to 300K reallocations in total

[16:35] <MasterDuke> nine: does that make all the stages faster?

[20:25] <timotimo> isn't that already fixed? :o

[22:37] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: it was, but that's another module
