[00:05] <samcv> jnthn: timotimo: these entries still need to be put into a proper changelog https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/wiki/ChangeLog-TODO

[00:06] <samcv> i've dealt with most of the changelog entries but these still have to be dealt with

[00:06] <samcv> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/wiki/ChangeLog-TODO

[00:06] <timotimo> oh, OK

[00:07] <samcv> there were like 370 things. i have it down to like 115

[00:07] <timotimo> nice work

[00:07] <jnthn> samcv++

[00:07] <jnthn> I can't promise much; I've over-committed for the next couple of days

[00:08] <jnthn> Will see what I can do with the couple of minutes I have before going to bed

[00:09] <samcv> ok :)

[00:10] <jnthn> I'm also not sure what level of granularity we're aiming for

[00:11] <jnthn> A bunch of them are related to context traversal refactoring, though I'm not quite sure what {foo} I should use for something that cross-cuts multiple subsystems...

[00:12] <jnthn> Traditionally I'd have just written "* Refactored context traversal to better cope with inlining"

[00:13] <jnthn> And left it at that

[00:13] <samcv> i can put it in a Misc section or just without a section

[00:13] <samcv> just put {General} actually

[00:13] <jnthn> Yeah

[00:14] <jnthn> tbh, I mostly feel confused :)

[00:14] <jnthn> My feeling was "ChangeLog is hand-wavey and folks who want details can `git log`"

[00:15] <samcv> jnthn: yeah just write something general then

[00:16] <jnthn> OK, but I guess we want to keep track of the SHA-1s that are summarized, or?

[00:16] *** Kaypie left
[00:16] <samcv> yeah, i'm trying to do that now

[00:17] <jnthn> On the Rakudo one I tried to help summarize my changes by `git log --author=jnthn` and writing them up, then went and looked at the change log, saw it was all sections and SHA-1s, sighed and that was about the end of my motivation to help with it. :S

[00:18] *** diakopter left
[00:18] <samcv> hah

[00:23] <jnthn> Anyway, I gathered the context traversal ones

[00:24] <jnthn> It feels like it did pure date ordering; grabbing the git log with --topo-order so that commits on a branch are together would perhaps be a bit easier

[12:08] <brrt> hehe

[12:09] <brrt> I was actually just looking into it for the purpose of making the JIT output debuggable

[12:09] <brrt> it's not so hard, at least if you have the linux elf headers

[12:10] <nwc10> "other platforms are avaailable" - ie can it be done nicely without breaking stuff on platforms which are ELF but we don't have headers for?

[12:11] <brrt> yes, but it is slightly harder since you have to basically do the definitions by yourself

[12:14] <brrt> With elf documentation in hand, writing an ELF formatter in C (or perl for that matter) is a job worth a day or two of work

[12:17] <robertle> I think guile does that as well

[12:18] <brrt> right

[12:25] <MasterDuke> that would be cool

[12:31] * brrt puts it on the ever lenghtening list

[12:44] * masak .oO( "TODO: make this list shorter" )

[12:44] * masak .oO( ...dammit! )

[12:51] <brrt> on the other hand, having to redo all of MoarVM's serialization logic... is less than awesome
