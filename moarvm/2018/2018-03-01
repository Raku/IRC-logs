[16:48] <brrt> ohai

[16:48] <brrt> .tell timotimo: the expr JIT isn't quite a silver bullet yet

[16:48] <yoleaux> brrt: What kind of a name is "timotimo:"?!

[16:49] <brrt> .tell timotimo that I know the expr JIT isn't quite a silver bullet yet, sometimes it works well, sometimes it works horribly; what I do believe is that it has much greater potential, for whatever that is worth :-)

[16:49] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[16:54] <brrt> i'm going to put this in a branch first anyway, but is there any objection to renaming MVM_JIT_LOG / MVM_SPESH_LOG to MVM_JIT_DEBUG and MVM_SPESH_DEBUG

[16:54] <brrt> seeing as 'log' is overloaded to mean 'logging types during execution' and 'logging spesh/jit action

[18:33] <timotimo> right

[18:33] <yoleaux> 16:49Z <brrt> timotimo: that I know the expr JIT isn't quite a silver bullet yet, sometimes it works well, sometimes it works horribly; what I do believe is that it has much greater potential, for whatever that is worth :-)

[19:42] <TimToady> sounds a lot like Perl 6 :-)
