[05:15] <Kaiepi> why does this code work fine for tcp sockets, but spit out gibberish for udp sockets? https://hastebin.com/uhonaqufaf.cpp

[05:15] <Kaiepi> this doesn't happen with .native-descriptor

[05:19] <Kaiepi> what i mean is the fds i get for udp sockets are always something like 644357232

[10:39] <Kaiepi> i forget if i asked or not, but why does this produce the wrong file descriptor values? https://hastebin.com/anikohowit.cpp

[10:40] <Kaiepi> this is in src/io/asyncsocketudp.c btw

[10:40] <Kaiepi> asyncsocket.c and syncsocket.c use similar code yet they aren't buggy

[10:42] <Kaiepi> ditto the asyncsocketudp code in the async introspection pullreqs

[10:42] <Kaiepi> i don't get why this in particular is buggy

[10:48] <timotimo> not sure, i'd probably rr record and go back and forth to see where that value comes from
