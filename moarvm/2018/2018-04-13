[08:41] <samcv> are people ok with this getting merged? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/840

[08:45] <brrt> i am. worst case people get a stale 'libatomic_ops' directory

[08:46] <samcv> yeah

[08:46] <samcv> i mean that stale directory is the reason it had issues

[08:46] <samcv> and could differ depending on if any straggler files were left over or not if git decided it wanted/didn't want to comply

[08:56] <brrt> go for it i say

[08:56] <brrt> btw, i didn't totally read your patch for hash seed randomization

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This should make sure there aren't issues when git fast forwards.

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fixes issue #839

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 4034d9def4 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/core/nativecall_libffi.c

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix small integer return values of libffi callbacks

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Apparently at least on some architectures libffi allocates a full ffi_arg

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: for a callbacks return value and this has to be written in full. Otherwise

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: we may end up with stale data in the high bytes.

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: libffi docs are vague about this, but do say that "rvalue must point to

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: storage that is sizeof(ffi_arg) or larger for non-floating point types.

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: <…commit message has 6 more lines…>

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/4034d9def4

[08:58] <samcv> nice ffi fixes. I use ffi

[08:59] <samcv> since the default for whatever reason fails more tests

[09:02] <nine> Apparently libffi is barely documented. But at least is has comprehensive tests from which one can infer correct behavior

[09:37] <samcv> i'm going to bed. night all o/

[19:29] <FROGGS> hah!

[19:29] <FROGGS> I found the cause for my trouble -> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2018-04-11#i_16035620

[19:30] <FROGGS> the int8 attributes are problematic in here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/lib/NativeCall.pm6#L269-L270

[19:30] <FROGGS> I changed these to int, and my program no longer crashes

[20:22] <lizmat> \o/

[20:24] <AlexDaniel> hm

[21:39] <AlexDaniel> .tell FROGGS so are you going to commit that, or what's the idea?

[21:39] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to FROGGS.
