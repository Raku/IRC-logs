[02:08] <timotimo> doing s/alloc/deopt/ on "allocation" gives "deoptation" and that is beautiful

[02:19] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any idea what recent expr jit change (i assume to a template) could cause 'MoarVM panic: Register types do not match between value and node' in ./t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t ?

[02:23] <timotimo> no clue about that :(

[02:23] <timotimo> was just about to go to bed

[02:24] <MasterDuke> no worries, later then...

[10:39] <nine> dogbert11: fun fact. I can reproduce the 'Register types do not match between value and node' running that test in a loop, but I cannot whith MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1. Did you notice that the error always appears after all tests were run?

[10:41] <nine> From this I assume that we try to JIT compile something while already shutting down the VM. So it's probably not an individual template's fault.

[10:59] <nine> .tell brrt t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t is failing occasionally with 'Register types do not match between value and node' at the end after all tests passed. Error goes away completely with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 which makes me believe that we're trying to JIT compile while already shutting down the VM.

[10:59] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[11:37] <lizmat> nine: bump time again ?

[11:42] <nine> lizmat: only needed for the JS backend. So I don't know

[11:42] <lizmat> ok, I'll leave this to decide by pmurias then
