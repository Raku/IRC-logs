[13:41] <timotimo> at least i managed to nerdsnipe hoelzro, or so it seems

[13:49] <pmurias> is just casting pointer from a a MVMString* to MVMObject* allowed?

[13:49] <pmurias> * is just casting a pointer from a a MVMString* to MVMObject* allowed?

[13:53] <timotimo> yes it is

[13:53] <timotimo> both are MVMCollectable

[14:24] <pmurias> timotimo: so any MVMString* returning function can be used to return an obj from an op?

[14:26] <timotimo> i think an MVMString can only go in a .s register, if you want it in a .o you'll have to box it

[14:27] <pmurias> it seems nqp::serializetobuf returns a  MVMString repr thing instead of a P6str

[14:28] <timotimo> that sounds a little wrong

[14:29] <pmurias> the op is broken

[14:29] <pmurias> * that

[16:49] <timotimo> hoelzro: fwiw, i'm considering adding a bit of code to the hll backend that is responsible for generating the .sql file so that it collects that info while it's already going through the tree anyway

[23:29] <MasterDuke> very nice, you seem to be making accelerating progress

[23:32] <timotimo> not long until the singularity

[23:33] <timotimo> updated with your suggestions, thanks!
