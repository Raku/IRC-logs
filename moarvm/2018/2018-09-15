[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix wrong field in exprjit cast and add macro

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: In the 'objprimbits' template, accidently used the wrong field name for

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: In this case, 'boxed_primitive' and 'bits' are both the same size, but

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: that doesn't make it less wrong just less painfully wrong 😉.

[07:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:01] <diakopter> does MoarVM have a stack depth limit these days

[20:01] <timotimo> it does not

[20:01] <timotimo> not that i know, at least

[20:02] <timotimo> i think if you just sub a { a }; a; it'll malloc until the OS dies (more likely that it'll hang and stall than that it'll reliably kill the process, in my experience at least)

[20:05] <diakopter> yeah. at one point it did, I think

[20:05] *** zakharyas left
[20:05] <timotimo> i know parrot had something like that

[20:06] <timotimo> which i believe was not more than just having a counter for how many stack frames have been used yet, and you could configure it with an op

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Add support for utf-16 decodestream

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Adds support for utf-16. At the moment only handles the same endianess

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: as the processor. We may want to have utf16le and utf16be as options.

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: When we decode a utf16 string (standard, not decodestream) we check for

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: a BOM, byte order marker. But if we are using decodestream we may be

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: starting decode partway through the file, so we will probably have to

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: save this data.

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:29] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: For now this gets utf16 working for those who need it.

[20:31] <timotimo> it can, but it's a bit of manual work that's involved :)

[20:32] <timotimo> actually

[20:32] <timotimo> there's t/nativecall/01-basic.t inside the nqp repository

[20:32] <diakopter> oh yeah.

[20:53] <lizmat> samcv: that is making Tux quite happy

[20:53] <samcv> yay

[20:53] <lizmat> he would be even happier with utf16le and utf16be

[20:54] <lizmat> :-)

[20:54] <samcv> heh

[20:54] <samcv> ok :)

[20:54] <lizmat> i think it's one of the blockers for him to really take Perl 6 into production

[20:54] <samcv> where does he get these utf16 files :P
