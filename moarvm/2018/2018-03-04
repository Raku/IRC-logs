[00:20] <dogbert17> timotimo: when using MVM_SPESH_LIMIT and setting it to the first crashing value then the last specialization is indeed for Spesh of 'get-proxy' (cuid: 95, file: site#sources/FD28A8E22DFE16B70B757D9981C7B6C25543060C (HTTP::UserAgent):368)

[00:35] <timotimo> i take it the spesh log is still ginormous?

[00:35] <timotimo> it probably compresses *really* well

[19:57] <MasterDuke> i just tried doing a --profile-stage=optimize of the rakudo build, but i'm getting a segfault here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/interp.c#L5922

[19:58] <MasterDuke> the backtrace is just #2 main, #1 MVM_vm_run_file, #0 MVM_interp_run

[21:14] <timotimo> i see a juicy problem with profile-stage

[21:14] <timotimo> for you see, run_profiled goes through @END and call everything in there

[21:14] <timotimo> er, no, not quite

[22:19] <MasterDuke> timotimo: thoughts on how to fix it?

[22:22] <timotimo> it ended up not being an actual problem, then i got sidetracked

[22:23] <timotimo> in other news, i'm real close to publishing my blog post

[22:23] <MasterDuke> nice

[22:24] <timotimo> this was fun, I hope I'll enjoy the next posts as much as I did this one

[22:37] <MasterDuke> more power to you. through forced practice in school and work i've gotten not terrible at writing, but i still never enjoy it

[22:40] <timotimo> i think the result is also not terrible

[22:43] <timotimo> i just did a pass over the text splitting long sentences that were already multiple parts in the middle, so hopefully the text is more comfortable to read
