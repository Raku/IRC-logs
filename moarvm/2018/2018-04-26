[08:18] <lizmat> " doesn't work for me either anymore: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/b40058cee4738cffba91c1e3a0c888a3

[08:18] <lizmat> it may be that I'm not quite awake yet, but both of these are pretty weird / mysterious to me at this point

[12:55] <brrt> jnthn: my main question wrt to a high-level interface to spesh was going to be, where are we going to run the HLL snippets

[14:00] <jnthn> So, with all the silly fixed...now I have a "fun" issue of a spesh guard op being executed when spesh_cand and effective spesh slots are nulled out :S

[14:13] <jnthn> Only happens when inlining is enabled

[14:16] <jnthn> (gdb) p cur_op - bytecode_start

[14:16] <jnthn> $8 = -141721352

[14:16] <jnthn> Well...that should never happen. o.O

[14:20] <jnthn> ah, the deopt log ends with a blaze of "JIT: can't find deopt all idx"

[14:23] *** squashable6 joined
[14:23] <jnthn> Though things don't go any better with JIT disabled

[14:28] *** brrt joined
[14:47] <brrt> jnthn: have you tried tools/jit-bisect.pl with the --spesh flag?

[14:48] <jnthn> No, but things are getting stranger. I tried to put in a sanity check that when we return to a frame and it has no spesh cand, return_address is within the bytecode's range. And it fails sometimes...even with spesh disabled o.O

[14:48] <brrt> it's usually pretty good, and it is arguably better with the spesh-limit-debug-log branch 🤓

[14:48] <brrt> that is pretty odd indeed

[14:50] <brrt> i'm looking at something that i think is also odd...

[14:55] <timotimo> damn, that socket error reporting thing was my mistake, wasn't it ...

[14:55] <timotimo> also: not enough spec tests :)

[14:56] <brrt> i've wished for a testsuite for the JIT at some point

[14:56] <dogbert2_> jnthn: are you trying to solve dmaestro's inlining problem? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/775

[14:57] <jnthn> dogbert2_: No. I got a really weird spesh failure when testing the fixes for the socket issue I was working on earlier

[14:58] <jnthn> Then I thought I'd put in some simple debug code to try and catch where things go wrong, and it caught things even with spesh disabled

[14:58] <jnthn> So now I'm pretty confused

[14:58] <dogbert2_> oops

[14:59] <jnthn> We do

[14:59] <jnthn> *(tc->interp_cur_op) = caller->return_address;

[14:59] <jnthn> *(tc->interp_bytecode_start) = MVM_frame_effective_bytecode(caller);

[14:59] <timotimo> :D

[14:59] <timotimo> that *could* be wrong

[14:59] <jnthn> If spesh is disabled then the second function call is always caller->static_info->body.bytecode

[15:00] <jnthn> And sure there's no way caller->return_address should be outside of the bytecode we're returning in to?

[15:00] <jnthn> *surely

[15:00] <timotimo> have i recommended rr? :)

[15:01] <timotimo> you can set hardware watchpoints on these two fields and step backwards to when either of them got changed

[15:02] <dogbert2_> m: say $*IN.lines.head(250).grep({  / ^ <[ " ]> <[ \w - ]>+ <[ " ]> $ / })».subst( / \" /, "", :g ).elems

[15:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b092c94: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[15:04] <dogbert2_> what piece of code are you running when things go wrong?

[15:06] <jnthn> The simplest code that trips over my sanity check is t/nqp/019-file-ops.t

[15:08] <jnthn> https://gist.github.com/jnthn/f701ad409966d8b02179a6c2925d7850

[15:08] <jnthn> That is the added check. I can only hope I'm doing something stupid in it...

[15:09] <jnthn> In this case the address is *before* the start of the bytecode...

[15:10] <brrt> zero, perchance?

[15:11] <jnthn> (gdb) p caller->return_address - caller->static_info->body.bytecode

[15:11] <jnthn> $4 = 1463542

[15:11] <jnthn> brrt: zero where?

[15:11] <jnthn> (gdb) p caller->return_address

[15:11] <jnthn> $1 = (MVMuint8 *) 0x7ffff50c177a "\b"

[15:11] <jnthn> (gdb) p caller->static_info->body.bytecode

[15:11] <jnthn> $2 = (MVMuint8 *) 0x7ffff4f5c284 "\214"

[15:12] <brrt> that is odd, yes

[15:13] <jnthn> This is with spesh disabled (so, no jitting, no speshing)

[15:13] <timotimo> and no instrumentation either i'm sure

[15:14] <jnthn> No, just running directly

[15:14] <jnthn> Also this is telling:

[15:14] <jnthn> at <unknown>:1  (NQPCORE.setting.moarvm:)

[15:14] <jnthn> from <unknown>:1  (NQPCORE.setting.moarvm:open)

[15:14] <jnthn> from gen/moar/stage2/NQPCORE.setting:893  (NQPCORE.setting.moarvm:open)

[15:14] <jnthn> That's a p MVM_dump_backtrace(tc) at that point

[15:15] <jnthn> Note how the location info is weird

[15:15] <jnthn> What's really odd though is...this works o.O

[15:15] <jnthn> Like, it runs correctly

[15:15] <brrt> hmm

[15:16] <timotimo> AFK for a little

[15:16] <brrt> so, what if you don't panic, but step into the debugger, and see how the program continues

[15:17] <dogbert2_> jnthn: adding you check causes several tests (nqp) to fail

[15:17] <dogbert2_> MoarVM panic: Caller return address 911160144 bytes after end of bytecode

[15:17] <jnthn> brrt: Well, I bp'd it in gdb, but yeah

[15:17] *** harrow joined
[15:19] <jnthn> Ah, interestingly the test is

[15:19] <jnthn> dies-ok({ open('file_does_not_exist_for_sure', :r);

[15:19] <jnthn> }, 'open dies on missing file');

[15:19] <jnthn> So exceptions are involved here also

[15:20] <dogbert2_> add_to_frontier_set, wonder what that is

[15:21] <jnthn> ohhh, maybe the special return mechanism is what makes it right

[15:29] <jnthn> Indeed, a different but similar check after that gives me just one NQP test that is unhappy

[15:30] <jnthn> ah, and unwinding sets the address explicitly

[15:40] * jnthn wonders if the failure he now sees tripping the error will be a real issue

[16:18] <dogbert17> is it a real issue?

[16:40] <jnthn> Dunno, but the SEGV I started out hunting is. And it doesn't trip the sanity check

[16:42] *** brrt joined

[16:49] *** domidumont joined
[16:50] <jnthn> Yeah, I really can't figure what's going on :S

[16:51] <jnthn> It ends up interpreting specialized code, in a frame with no spesh_cand

[16:51] <brrt> we can sometimes NULL the spesh cand in a deopt, i think

[16:51] <brrt> i was looking at that just now

[16:53] <jnthn> Sure, but we should always move the bytecode while we do it

[16:56] <brrt> it's might suspicious for sure

[16:56] <brrt> *mighty

[17:00] <jnthn> We end up with cur_op pointing at specialized bytecode, and bytecode_start pointing at unspecialized

[17:00] <jnthn> And it all seems to happen around exceptions

[17:01] *** zakharyas joined
[17:04] <jnthn> Hmm, and the thread where things go wrong does a resume shortly before blowing up

[17:07] <jnthn> Yes, the spesh address is precisely the one inside of the exception where we resume

[17:07] <jnthn> Ouch.

[17:09] <jnthn> So the sequence of events is 1. exception thrown, handler runs. 2. exception handler cuases global deopt. 3. exception resume address is now invalid

[17:09] <jnthn> Since it points into specialized code

[17:12] <jnthn> Don't think I've the brain to fix that today, but at least I understand what's going on now, which is half the battle. :)
