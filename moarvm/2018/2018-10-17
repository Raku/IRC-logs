[13:23] <dogbert2_> is this an old GC related problem? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/c7e9b9372d5b2142a525c5a957d4d62e

[13:29] <timotimo> haven't seen bind_one_param explode like that yet

[13:30] <dogbert2_> could it be a missing MVM_ROOT?

[13:32] <timotimo> it's possible

[13:33] <timotimo> does changing flags like spesh and jit and such have an impact?

[13:33] <dogbert2_> I'm on 32 bit so the JIT is off the hook :)

[13:34] <dogbert2_> but I'm quite certain that I got it to fail at least once whit MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[16:35] <timotimo> even with Configure.pl running?

[16:35] <timotimo> if that's the case, it's probably just a line missing in Makefile.in

[16:37] <dogbert17> timotimo: I ran my usual 'perl Configure.pl --debug  --prefix=../../install/' first

[16:47] <timotimo> OK

[16:48] <timotimo> then it probably misses the line in Makefile.in

[17:49] <nine> timotimo: why would the profiler show 0 % jit of a routine despite the jit log clearly showing jit compilation?

[18:10] <timotimo> it could be inlined into the caller routine and that could be bailed by some missing op

[18:11] <timotimo> nine: can you find mention of the routine being inlined?

[18:29] <nine> timotimo: no, which is an oddity in itself, considering that the routine is just method (uint16 $i) { nqp::writeuint(self, nqp::elems(self), $i, 2); }

[18:30] <nine> Could it be because of the manual type setup here? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/nqp-mbc/lib/MAST/Nodes.nqp#L43

[18:30] <japhb> nine: nameless?

[18:31] * japhb wonders if there's something in the profiler unhappy about the nameless routine
