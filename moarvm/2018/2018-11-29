[09:40] <jnthn> samcv: That one is most of the time because they got an exception in some native callback and didn't handle it, and due to the C stack wedged on the code inbetween we don't (can't, in some senses) handle that so well.

[17:07] <samcv> jnthn, afaik they aren't using any nativecall code

[17:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[17:08] <samcv> yeah he's not

[17:10] <samcv> they say they had to move the return out of a react to fix it. otherwise that error comes up

[20:13] <jnthn> Oh...yeah, doing `return` in a `react` isn't going to end well unless we very magically handle it :)

[21:00] <jnthn> lizmat: You'd need to handle it a lot like `done` in the supply internals, I guess, but it's a bit tricky because most of those are shared between react/supply and we'd only want this for react. Then one'd need to marshall the exception from the thread that did the `return` back to the thread that was blocking on the `react`.

[21:00] <jnthn> Do-able, but needs care

[21:00] <lizmat_> jnthn: ack

[21:03] <jnthn> But probably worth doing, since folks are trying it, and I can't think of a reason to consider it harmful to make it work.
