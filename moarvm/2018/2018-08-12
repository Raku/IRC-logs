[18:05] <timotimo> looking at speshed nqp code makes me really sad

[18:06] <timotimo> here's an inlined frame that binds something in a positional slot

[18:07] <timotimo> the slot comes from an int that was coerce_ni'd from the result of smrt_numify, which got its input value from box_n, which had its num value from the smrt_numify of something that got deconted after it came from a p6ogetvt_o

[18:08] <timotimo> i think that was MAST::Nodes's MAST::Local.new

[18:09] <timotimo> the :$index goes through those "fun" steps

[18:13] <MasterDuke> some of those should go away in my default_to_int nqp branch (if i can get it to build again)

[18:17] <timotimo> i ... see here a BB that has a predecessor 84 ... there's only 37 BBs in this graph

[18:18] <timotimo> i've got high hopes for default_to_int

[18:25] <MasterDuke> still getting those same errors though
