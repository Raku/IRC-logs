[00:05] <timotimo> i think the problem was that there used to be a folder where we had the 3rdparty code directly in the moar repository and i decided we should have it as a submodule instead

[00:05] <timotimo> but gits all over the country exclaimed "cannot unlink 3rdparty/foobar because it's not empty!"

[00:06] <jnthn> ah, that sounds like exactly the situation samcv's PR creates too?

[00:06] <jnthn> So yeah, maybe we do want my "different directory name" workaround

[00:07] <timotimo> i believe it happens mostly because .o files and such will be left over in there ... but isn't libatomic_ops only header files? maybe it can work out after all

[00:10] <jnthn> Hmm...think its configure process must create some artefacts though?

[00:11] <timotimo> quite possibly

[00:11] <timotimo> maybe we want to make extra sure this time

[01:14] <timotimo> jnthn: when you wrote about the LeakTracer you used for the Promise.in leak, you said "Also, darn, the binary format loads faster at least, when it works :P"; I'm not sure if I interpreted that correctly; is something wrong with the binary format? other than perhaps if you uncleanly exit it won't load just yet ...

[09:55] <jnthn> timotimo: It may have been version skew in moar-ha or some similar issue

[10:10] <pmurias> a MoarVM segfault is always a bug?

[10:10] <pmurias> nqp::bindpos_i on a type object segfaults

[10:10] *** lizmat joined
[10:15] <jnthn> Yes, that's worth reporting (it'll just be a missing IS_CONCRETE check)
