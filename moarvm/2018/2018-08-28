[15:07] <brrt> nine: the main thing is that I want to introduce a new sigil for write-operands

[15:07] <yoleaux> 07:07Z <nine> brrt: what's the goal of the refactor?

[15:07] <timotimo> is this to do with exclamation mark templates or something else?

[15:07] <brrt> yeah, something like that

[15:07] <timotimo> since what expr nodes write isn't really named, right?

[15:08] <brrt> I want it to be obvious that the $0 in a write-operand template is not a value but a reference

[15:08] <brrt> correct

[15:08] <timotimo> oh, like that you mean

[15:08] <brrt> that is the overarching goal

[15:08] <timotimo> so we'd have like >0

[15:08] <brrt> yeah

[15:08] <brrt> I was actually thinking of \$0

[15:08] <timotimo> we don't have ops that have more than one write register operand, right?

[15:08] <brrt> but whatevs :-)

[15:09] <brrt> not yet (maybe never)

[15:09] *** robertle left
[15:10] <brrt> so. I can hack that in, and it'll work....

[15:10] <brrt> but I'm annoyed by the current level of complexity

[15:11] <timotimo> you can just make a \ in front a no-op, and also warn if it's not $0 that follows it :P

[15:11] <brrt> that won't work, the \$0 is parsed as a single token

[15:11] <brrt> and more importantly, I want to capture instance of that missing

[15:12] <timotimo> ah

[15:12] <timotimo> that means the guard ops would become exclamation mark templates, too

[15:12] <timotimo> since they don't necessarily write

[15:12] <brrt> no, no

[15:13] <brrt> a template that doesn't yield any value doens't need an exclamation mark

[15:13] <brrt> it is only templates that *overwrite* the register that is used as their output that need exclamation marks

[15:13] <timotimo> well, guard ops now sometimes write to a different register than they read from

[15:13] <brrt> ah, really?

[15:14] <brrt> guard ops write?

[15:14] <brrt> hmmm

[15:14] <timotimo> yep, if the register differs

[15:14] <timotimo> part of the set elimination optimization i think?

[15:14] <brrt> example?

[15:14] <brrt> oh

[15:14] <timotimo>       [Annotation: INS Deopt One (idx 9 -> pc 464; line 2706)]

[15:14] <timotimo>       sp_guard         r18(1),   r6(9), sslot(1), litui32(464)

[15:15] <jnthn> Guard ops at the point they are inserted will always be two verions of hte same register, but yes, a future set elimination opt might rewrite the instruction

[15:15] <jnthn> And the reason guards do this now is so we have before/after, which lets us do guard elimination

[15:16] <brrt> i see

[15:16] <brrt> that makes a bunch of sense

[15:18] <jnthn> It's also important that the write does not take place if the guard isn't met :)

[15:18] <jnthn> (Yes, I did that mistake. Yes, it was fun to debug. :P)

[15:18] <MasterDuke> btw, while people are active. did it make sense in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/949 to merge my branch into post-release-opts? or should i have just done master?

[15:18] <timotimo> post-release-opts is safe in any case

[15:21] <jnthn> It's safe, though its merge schedule is unknown

[15:23] <MasterDuke> well, no hurry for my PR

[20:58] <samcv> this tool is making it much faster to go through the changelog :) and i can merge one commit's subject into another one. though that needs a bit more refinement. and i probably will also add ability to tag items that i need to ask people about
