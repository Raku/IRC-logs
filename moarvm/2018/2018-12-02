[12:16] <dogbert17> any idea why the snippet above should upset valgrind here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/interp.c#L232

[12:16] <dogbert17> claiming that 'Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)'

[12:19] <timotimo> well, i guess the register that's being inspected there hasn't been initialized, or perhaps it has something to do with truncation/expansion??

[12:19] <dogbert17> timotimo: 1¹¹ does not complain
