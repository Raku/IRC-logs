[07:26] <samcv> if anyone is around. proof the changelog if you have ti me

[07:26] <samcv> *time

[07:51] <nwc10> "provide text exception text" *seems* like a tautology, but when I read it twice I think I see why "text" is in their twice.

[07:51] <nwc10> but is there a way to phrase it without "text" twice?

[07:51] <nwc10> I assume the "text" used to be just a number

[07:55] <samcv> heh

[07:55] <samcv> thanks nwc10. my brain skipped right over that :)

[09:42] <jnthn> Finally, snow! \o/

[09:51] <nwc10> I think we're on Snow 3.0 already this year

[09:59] <jnthn> It's snowed a tiny bit here earlier on, but this is the first time it seems to be settling.

[10:05] <lizmat> we've one night of snow that was gone by the time we woke up

[13:45] <brrt> ohai jnthn

[13:48] <nwc10> good *, *

[13:50] <brrt> I'm facing having to fix the 'type checker' in the expression template compiler

[13:58] <jnthn> What's broken about it?

[14:21] <brrt> it isn't able to handle num operands

[14:22] <brrt> I wonder if there are any architectures out there that have floating point support in general purpose registers

[14:35] <nwc10> brrt: not *sure* if this is what you mean by "in general purpose registers", but see "soft" and specifically "softfp" in "float-abi" in https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/10/9/r1q7pksku2q3gww9rpqef0dnskphtc

[14:35] <nwc10> (or anything else about the ARM ABI)

[14:36] <nwc10> this is more about marshalling FP values into pairs of integer registers to pass around

[14:36] <nwc10> if I understand it correctly

[14:38] <nwc10> but my undestanding somewhat fails at anything newer than the "old" ABI

[14:38] <nwc10> (ie more than a decade ago)

[14:38] <brrt> huh, that's interesting

[14:38] * nwc10 needs to go to catch a train

[14:38] <timotimo> IMO "soft float" is not quite enough to say "floating point support" :D

[14:39] <nwc10> (or at least, watch the ETA randomly jump around whilst getting cold)

[14:40] <brrt> anyway, the hardware FP support wants specific floating point registers, so doesn't count

[14:40] <brrt> I presume that makes a bunch of sense on a hardware level, but I wouldn't know
