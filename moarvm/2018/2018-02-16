[01:59] <MasterDuke> samcv: do we use memchr for finding a single char in a string?

[02:00] <samcv> MasterDuke: for 8bit strings, yes

[02:00] <samcv> MasterDuke: err actually technically no. but we do use it through libc or glibc

[02:00] <samcv> let me check

[02:01] <MasterDuke> cool. i just saw something on HN about the new release of rust using it for some dramatic speedup

[02:02] <samcv> MasterDuke: freebsd memmem uses memchr as needed

[02:02] <samcv> and i'm 95% sure glibc does as well

[02:03] <MasterDuke> so we get it "for free"? nice

[02:04] <samcv> yeah it uses the distro memmem. so windows will use window's memmem, even though freebsd's memmem

[02:04] <samcv> no clue about difference in speed between platforms of memmem

[02:07] <samcv> *memchr

[07:24] <yoleaux> 15 Feb 2018 22:37Z <MasterDuke> brrt: does https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c7774e37d2 fix the getlexstatic_o template also?

[07:25] <brrt> .tell MasterDuke to be honest I'd expect not

[07:25] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[07:25] <brrt> maybe the box_i template

[07:25] <brrt> symptoms of the getlexstatic_o call were quite different

[08:13] <nine> brrt++ # benchmarking is fun again

[08:21] <brrt> :-)

[08:31] <brrt> nine: do you recall what broke from the box_i template?

[08:32] <nine> sorry, don't remember anything specific

[08:33] <brrt> hmm

[08:34] <brrt> i think maybe nwc10 was complaining about that at some point

[08:41] <nwc10> I didn't mean to be "complaining" - "reporting that it's broken, and that the cause seems to be X"

[08:41] <nwc10> and, IIRC, yes, something broke, forgot what

[08:41] <nwc10> is there an easy way to re-enable it and hence test?

[08:41] <nwc10> "be X, and I don't have any good idea how to fix it"

[08:43] <brrt> hehe sorry, i used the wrong phrase

[08:43] <brrt> was *reporting* very usefully, that stuff was broken

[08:43] <brrt> unfortunately I couldn't figure out what was

[08:43] <brrt> yeah, sure, i can re-enable that template

[08:44] *** Ven`` joined
[08:47] <nwc10> brrt: was more - "Is there a commit I can revert locally and then test?"

[08:47] <brrt> oh yes

[08:48] <brrt> this one

[08:49] *** Ven`` joined
[08:50] <nwc10> OK, started, but I have other things to do so might not be checking back for a while

[08:52] <brrt> ok, thanks

[09:28] <brrt> samcv: i was looking at the unicode.c file

[09:28] <brrt> i'm wondering if we can replace the concatenation with a #include
