[12:23] <brrt> \o

[12:53] <brrt> wait, nativeinvoke is solely for the JITted versions...

[12:55] <nine> yes?

[13:06] <brrt> so ehm, some of my hypotheses were wrong

[13:08] <brrt> more to the pointer, I don't know when nativeinvoke_o is introduced

[13:08] <brrt> *point

[13:09] <timotimo> nativecall's own little compiler thingie?

[13:09] <jnthn> "to the pointer"...when you've written too much C in a week :)

[13:21] <brrt> hehe

[13:21] <brrt> re: C

[13:21] <brrt> I forgot, but it turns out that C has an 'auto' keyword

[13:22] <brrt> do you know what it means?

[13:22] <jnthn> Umm...I know they stole it in C++ to mean "infer this type"... :)

[13:22] <jnthn> Or at least, I think that's what happened

[13:22] <brrt> yeah

[13:22] <jnthn> I think it's in the same class of things as static and register, though?

[13:22] <brrt> but it means 'this variables memory will be automatically reclaimed by the compiler as soon as you leave scope'

[13:22] <brrt> right

[13:23] <jnthn> Effectively, a lifetime specific, but since it's the default...nobody writes it :)

[13:23] <brrt> it's the default storage class

[13:23] <jnthn> *specifier

[13:23] <jnthn> Reclaiming it for type inference was kinda clever :)

[13:23] <jnthn> 'cus it's like "automatically figure out the type" :)

[13:23] <brrt> I was reminded by that by this: https://words.steveklabnik.com/borrow-checking-escape-analysis-and-the-generational-hypothesis

[13:24] <brrt> yeah, I have to hand it to the C++ committee

[13:24] <brrt> feels to me that the C++ has decided to not occupy a somewhat different space than C, to their benefit

[13:25] <brrt> s/not//

[13:27] <jnthn> *nod*

[13:27] <jnthn> Yeah, I thought that was a nice post

[13:34] <nine> brrt: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/lib/NativeCall.pm6#L402

[13:44] <brrt> thank you nine

[14:30] <brrt> hmmmm

[14:31] <brrt> so I'm wondering how to trigger this in the easiest way possible

[23:23] <jnthn> .tell Zoffix Planning to look at those next week (this one turned out very busy)

[23:23] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.
