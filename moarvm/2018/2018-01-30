[08:22] <timotimo> how can these tiles be missing and still the branch passes spectest i wonder

[08:22] <brrt> these templates are not ever compiled, then

[08:23] <timotimo> thought so :\

[08:23] <timotimo> hey while you're here, can we remove PHI from the "made tree out of [a, b, c, d]" output?

[08:25] <brrt> hmmm

[08:25] <timotimo> brrt: but does the exprjit even do anything with them?

[08:25] <timotimo> nwc10: i've seen that already the last few days, hum.

[08:26] <timotimo> nwc10: can you try the different env vars we have to see what it's sensitive to?

[08:26] <timotimo> also, can we build a script or something that does the env var testing for us?

[08:26] <nwc10> I was just testing that

[08:26] <nwc10> having just wondered about it

[08:26] <timotimo> thanks :)

[08:26] <timotimo> brrt: i'll remove it :)

[08:27] <brrt> timotimo: sure, go ahead

[08:28] <brrt> it doesn't do anything with them yet, but i plan to use them for the multiple-block building machinery i'm thinking of

[08:29] <timotimo> ah

[08:29] <timotimo> so maybe only skip them at the very beginning?

[08:30] <brrt> they should always be at the beginning :-)

[08:30] <timotimo> not if you merge multiple blocks?

[08:30] <brrt> but they're not useful now, so yeah, drop'm

[08:34] <nwc10> NQP build fails for me with that, passes without

[08:34] <nwc10> but that was with MoarVM at 3055debefd4019f3d74f63e0e1ee8bd1d93012d8

[08:34] <nwc10> will try with new master

[08:35] <timotimo> i'll be mostly afk for the rest of the day :|

[08:35] <nwc10> have fun.

[08:35] <nwc10> (I hope)

[08:37] <timotimo> probably not ;(

[08:37] <nwc10> oh :-(

[08:37] <nwc10> still goes boom on new master

[08:37] <nwc10> will try to bisect what caused it

[08:37] <nwc10> but I might have a meeting soon...

[08:38] <brrt> is that on linux?

[09:17] <brrt> hmmm

[09:18] <brrt> looks decently normal to me

[09:24] <nwc10> it's very strange how it also needs MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1

[09:24] <nwc10> or maybe that's not strange

[09:29] <brrt> what about MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING

[09:29] <brrt> can you make it happen with blocking and without nodelay

[09:31] <nwc10> will do that next

[15:37] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: it's the first time I use bots to bisect something like this, so maybe you should double-check‚Ä¶

[15:37] <AlexDaniel> also, if that's the one, then you can probably bisect moar with that

[15:39] <AlexDaniel> although maybe that won't tell much

[15:42] <MasterDuke> can the ops in rakudo (e.g., p6bool) be jitted?
