[10:39] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[10:39] <nwc10> jnthn: would you like the good news, and brrt the not so good news? :-)

[10:54] <jnthn> Well, this seems like a better deal for me than brrt++... :)

[10:55] <nwc10> jnthn: I can get to the spectest again with +#define MVM_SPESH_CHECK_DU 1

[10:55] <nwc10> no idea what changed when, but something you (singular or plural) did fixed the underlying bug that that had hit

[10:57] <nwc10> and for brrt (and everyone else I guess), the --ubsan option to Configure is somewhat Less Awesome than it ideally should be, because (I forget which bit of 3rd party code) the JIT headers do undefined behaviour, so it always spits out pretty warnings

[10:57] <nwc10> which messes up spectests that check output

[10:57] <nwc10> (can't trivially check right now, as I'm spectesting again)

[10:57] <nwc10> but it's some header with x86 in the filename, so it knows what it expects

[10:57] <nwc10> but strictly it's undefined behaviour

[13:28] <dogbert2_> brrt:  trying to build MoarVM with your branch expr-jit-invoke failed for me. Got the message 'make: *** No rule to make target 'src/jit/nativecall.h', needed by 'src/main.o'. Stop.'

[13:28] <brrt> did you make reconfig

[13:28] <brrt> I might have not committed that file

[13:28] <dogbert2_> timotimo suspects something might be missing in makefile.in

[13:41] <nwc10> 3rdparty/dynasm/minilua.c:1609:4: runtime error: signed integer overflow: -2147483648 + -1 cannot be represented in type 'int'

[13:42] <nwc10> there. that's the (minimalist) pavement pizza line

[13:42] <nwc10> and that appears in the spectests

[13:42] <nwc10> so it confuses things

[13:42] <nwc10> and I'm misremembered where it came from

[13:44] <brrt> hmmm. I see

[13:44] <brrt> but.... we don't link minilua?

[13:44] <brrt> we do link dasm_x86.h

[13:44] <brrt> and I'm ready to believe there's UB there

[13:56] <dogbert2_> brrt++ it builds now. have to wait until I get home before I can test it though

[14:04] <nwc10> oh, not totally misrembmbering

[14:04] <nwc10> (I spared you the bold and the red)

[14:04] <nwc10> so that's a second place

[14:13] <nwc10> that one is quite common

[14:40] <timotimo> now i don't have to have two versions of perl6 installed any more to both have my newest profiler output stuff and a working cro :)

[14:56] <brrt> hmm, ubsan is probably right, but I'm not sure I see the problem in practice

[14:56] <brrt> I'll have to think up a formulation in which this works
