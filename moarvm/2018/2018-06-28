[06:28] <brrt> .tell lizmat I saw one mention that said that 'perl6 on MoarVM is starting to grow a JIT"

[06:28] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[06:28] <lizmat> .

[06:28] <yoleaux> 06:28Z <brrt> lizmat: I saw one mention that said that 'perl6 on MoarVM is starting to grow a JIT"

[06:28] <brrt> ohai lizmat

[06:28] <lizmat> yeah, I saw it too  :-)

[06:29] <lizmat> I think the "starting to grow a JIT" is not doing the MoarVM JIT justice, though

[06:29] <brrt> heh, maybe it'd be worthwhile to have a post that says 'Perl6 has a JIT, and it is useable and in production, read here for more'

[06:29] <brrt> (and I'd include all of spesh into that discussion)

[06:29] <lizmat> be my guest, although maybe a simple comment with a link would suffice

[06:30] <brrt> meh, nobobdy will see that

[06:30] <brrt> the whole discussion is ... light on facts unfortunately

[06:30] <brrt> (probably nearly everybody else who knows how to hack one is busy actually doing so :-P)

[06:31] <brrt> i did think of the following though

[06:31] <brrt> you know how all problems in CS can be solved by adding another layer of indirection?

[06:31] <brrt> and how layers of indirection are the worst thing for performance?

[06:31] <brrt> well, perl6 solves a lot of problems for you ;-)

[06:46] <brrt> another one bytes the dust...

[06:47] <brrt> I've decided I'm moving in the direction of making the expression template compiler (perl) smarter and the expression template application (c) dumber

[06:55] <samcv> well i got the docs building on travis finally heh

[06:56] <samcv> sadly everything on travis seems broken. gradle was broken. and asciidoctor was broken too. so had to dl both those. (this will only be in our coverage branch that we'll end up doing this extra stuff)

[06:58] <samcv> and openjdk 7 isn't compiled with enough crypto algos so gradle was failing because it couldn't access the https page :P

[12:34] <brrt> I think I can move cast insertion to the expr template compiler as well, with a bit of work

[12:35] <brrt> If so, and if I can encode type + size in the expr compiler, I can completely remove MVM_jit_expr_tree_analyze
