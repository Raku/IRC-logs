[08:07] <lizmat> not sure what's going on here, but the following code when run with --profile, fails deeply inside the grammar engine

[08:07] <lizmat> my @alts = ^256; "127.0.0.1" ~~ /^ @alts ** 4 % \. $/ for ^2

[08:07] <lizmat> with for ^1, it doesn't

[08:08] <lizmat> but I guess that would be the static optimizer taking that one out

[08:09] <lizmat> if you actually let it say the result, then it does show the first iteration

[08:10] <lizmat> this is probably not a release  blocker

[08:10] <masak> lizmat++

[08:10] <masak> lizmat: submit an issue somewhere to track it?

[08:11] <lizmat> yeah, I will, but I thought I'd mention it here first
