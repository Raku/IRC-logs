[13:30] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Remove internal ops from MAST NQP modules

[13:30] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[13:30] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: These ops must only be generated by MoarVM itself and thus have no place in a

[13:30] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: public API. Removal also speeds up compilation of the NQP compiler a little.

[13:55] <robertle> nine: I am afraid there seems to be another big endian bug, perhaps similar to the previous one and there fore easier to find? https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=rakudo&arch=mips&ver=2018.12-2&stamp=1546174381&raw=0

[13:55] <robertle> grep for finish_code_object

[13:58] <nine> robertle: doesn't show up in my powerpc VM

[14:00] <nine> robertle: is it reliably reproducible?

[14:03] <robertle> not sure yet, will play with it in a moment

[14:05] * nine is afk for a couple of hours for some r&r
