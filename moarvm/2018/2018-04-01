[00:13] <samcv> woah

[00:17] *** buggable joined
[00:28] <samcv> well i finally got all three important loops vectorizing on not just gcc7 but gcc6 as well

[00:28] <samcv> and it vectorizes with default settings (sse1 and sse2) though is a little faster if you let it use newer extensions

[00:58] <samcv> \o/

[01:11] <samcv> with sse2 instructions on gcc. test takes 5.2s. without 7.7s

[01:11] <samcv> to get to 256kb

[01:13] <samcv> current master takes 11.6s without sse2 and 11.55s with sse2

[01:23] *** FROGGS_ joined
[01:33] <samcv> yeah. just the collapse_strands part of this code is running 4x faster :) exceptional

[02:26] <MasterDuke> samcv: how did you do it for gcc? pragmas? or code changes?

[02:26] <yoleaux> 31 Mar 2018 22:24Z <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: fwiw https://github.com/perl6/atom-language-perl6/issues/66

[02:27] <samcv> MasterDuke: code changes

[02:27] <samcv> if only gcc was as easy as clang :(

[02:41] <samcv> so final stats are very close to exactly 2x faster without sse2, and 4x with sse2. i wonder how debian compiles their packages for x86_64

[02:51] <MasterDuke> very cool

[05:22] *** Util joined
[07:31] <samcv> jnthn: if you get the chance can you review my PR again. i've made the requested changes. no more referencing grapheme iterator directly

[11:45] <samcv> timotimo: see these new ./Configure.pl options I will be adding https://github.com/samcv/MoarVM/commit/0f54bb55fe3b91020edc54ed555f092eab02b5e1

[11:46] <samcv> should help others navigate the different clang and gcc debug options. and make it easier. for example what i set verbose 1-3 on clang are actually 3 options, but there's no point in using them not 1, or 1+2 or 1+2+3

[11:46] <samcv> also i gotta head to bed. night

[11:47] <timotimo> good night!
