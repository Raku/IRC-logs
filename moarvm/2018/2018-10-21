[00:10] <ugexe> I was investigating using uv_addrinfo to do async host name lookup, such as here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/d8e0a529a0e00aba83277a2e79219eff672d4463/src/io/asyncsocketudp.c#L579 -- however the first parameter is a uv_loop_t, and the functions that do host name lookup do not get passed a uv_loop_t. A few functions inside asyncsocket.c do get passed uv_loop_t (void write_setup, void close_perform,

[00:10] <ugexe> void setup_setup, void read_setup) but it is never used for anything. Is the way forward to pass uv_loop_t to the functions that would call uv_addrinfo ( MVMAsyncTask * write_bytes_to and MVMObject * MVM_io_socket_udp_async )? Or should things be refactored such that the host name lookup takes place somewhere else?

[08:47] <nine> Did you know? We compile 3093 frames (i.e. BEGIN blocks) during stage parse and another 425 during stage optimize. Compared to 15467 frames that are part of the normal compilation.

[08:53] <nine> Median frame size is 236 bytes, so my guess to pre-size bytecode buffers to 256 bytes was surprisingly spot on :)

[14:15] <nine> This is arguably one of the most bizarre uses of a domain name: http://www.cdqe.de/ (make sure you have a look at the source code, too)

[19:10] <brrt> ohai

[19:10] <brrt> .tell ugexe that an asynchronous function with a callback must run on the eventloop thread; them be the rules. You ought to be passed a uv_loop_t as a parameter

[19:10] <brrt> not sure if the bots are on this channel

[19:10] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to ugexe.

[19:13] <ugexe> brrt: the two functions where uv_addrinfo would be swapped in do not receive a uv_loop_t parameter. are you suggesting i should add this new parameter?

[19:13] <yoleaux> 19:10Z <brrt> ugexe: that an asynchronous function with a callback must run on the eventloop thread; them be the rules. You ought to be passed a uv_loop_t as a parameter

[19:14] <timotimo> ugexe: how does the code currently do things? does it use a blocking getaddrinfo?

[19:15] <ugexe> timotimo: yes

[19:15] <timotimo> OK, then we'll have to actually split the functions that used to call getaddrinfo in half

[19:15] <timotimo> that's what's so fun about async coding in C

[19:15] <timotimo> oh

[19:16] <timotimo> but if you set the callback to NULL it will run synchronously instead

[19:16] <timotimo> but your goal is to actually make it async?

[19:16] <ugexe> it still needs to be passed a uv_loop_t for the first parameter though

[19:16] <timotimo> or is there a different reason to replace getaddrinfo with uv_getaddrinfo?

[19:17] <ugexe> yes the goal is to make it async, and try to get the sync code to use it later ( for extra win32 stuffs )

[19:17] <timotimo> OK

[19:18] <timotimo> do you need more assistance turning the functions that use the function that has getaddrinfo into async stuff properly?

[19:20] <brrt> ugexe: synchronous libuv functions actually can accept a NULL uv_loop_t, in general

[19:20] <brrt> let me actually look at your patch for a second :-)

[19:22] <ugexe> possibly. there are a few functions that are passed uv_loop_t parameter, but it is never used -- so i question if adding the parameter to another function is the actually the right direction

[19:22] <brrt> no, that would never work in this case

[19:22] <brrt> see

[19:22] <brrt> this function is enqueueing work for the event loop

[19:23] <brrt> And it is only on the event loop that there is a uv_loop_t structure

[19:23] <ugexe> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/e4087dedf837f415056a45a838f639a3d9dc3ced/test/test-getaddrinfo.c#L146 <- an example of using it sync, but it still passes a loop

[19:24] <timotimo>   MAKE_VALGRIND_HAPPY();

[19:24] <timotimo> <3

[19:24] <brrt> so, I"m not sure if you can delay the bindaddr to setup_setup

[19:24] <brrt> but if you can, that's how you'd do it

[19:27] <ugexe> well there is also an instance of blocking getaddrinfo in write_bytes_to

[19:27] <timotimo> that's udp?

[19:27] <brrt> you can totally call uv_getaddrinfo with a NULL loop

[19:27] <brrt> it'll work. at least on unix

[19:28] <brrt> and on windows as well

[19:29] <brrt> if you want it async, with a callback, then yes, you'll need a uv_loop_t

[19:29] <brrt> source: I just read both versions. Neither of them have a read on loop, if cb is NULL as well

[19:30] <ugexe> that'll make swapping out syncsocket.c MVM_io_resolve_host_name easy enough then

[19:31] <ugexe> swapping out getaddrinfo from MVM_io_resolve_host_name rather
