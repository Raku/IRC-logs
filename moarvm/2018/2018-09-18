[13:52] <dogbert2> perhaps jnthn remembers

[13:55] <jnthn> On postrelease-opts, there are some SEGVs now and then in spectest that go away with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1

[14:06] * jnthn wonders if https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/2d499ec5d8ae0b7f4a3b0f9c7db6107b is still relevant/happening

[14:09] <brrt> jnthn: say no more, i'll investigate :-)

[14:09] <brrt> or mabe say more

[14:09] <jnthn> Well, MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 makes them go away, so argh.

[14:09] <jnthn> Or it was a lucky run.

[14:09] <brrt> oh...

[14:09] <brrt> hmmmm

[14:09] <jnthn> Since I was getting them only sometimes

[14:10] <diakopter> or it was unlucky both times

[14:10] <jnthn> I've also got one that shows up reliably under blocking but only with JIT disabled...wow.

[14:35] <jnthn> ooh, interesting

[14:40] * brrt wonders if ASAN makes them more reliable

[14:55] <jnthn> Well, latest spectest run was fine, and the last faily one (with JIT) was some days ago...

[14:55] * jnthn doing another run now

[14:55] <jnthn> oh, no, yesterday

[14:55] <jnthn> But still, rebuilt everything sience

[14:55] <jnthn> *since

[14:55] <timotimo> btw we don't have hllbool and hllboolfor in facts.c

[14:57] <jnthn> And a second clean run

[14:57] <jnthn> (this is with postrelease-opts)

[15:03] <jnthn> dogbert2: I think the DU chain fail is due to a mistake in the hllboolfor opt

[15:04] <dogbert2> jnthn: aha, that makes sense, i.e. I was certain that it had been eradicated from postrelease-opts

[15:06] <jnthn> Well, it's there too now, because I rebased onto master :)

[15:06] <dogbert2> as for postrelease-opts, you enabled a new check there for SC-index. I guess that bug hasn't been fixed yet?

[15:07] <dogbert2> it was possible to trigger that check with e.g. https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/24e6033ef092560ab1d6e3c8cfdfb444

[15:10] <jnthn> Did you manage to get that bug to happen on master too?

[15:11] <dogbert2> haven't tried

[15:13] <dogbert2> I guess I'll have to move that commit to master first

[15:19] <jnthn> I can repro https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/24e6033ef092560ab1d6e3c8cfdfb444 one in every few runs

[15:20] <brrt> yay, i guess :-)

[15:20] <brrt> this is JIT sensitive?

[15:21] <jnthn> Nope, shows up with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1

[15:21] <brrt> oh, hm..

[15:21] <jnthn> However, I can't get it to happen with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[15:24] <jnthn> Not in many, many runs

[15:24] <jnthn> Nor with MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1

[15:25] <dogbert2> perhaps a smaller nursery might help

[15:25] <jnthn> Well, or it's inlining related ;)

[15:25] <dogbert2> any theories?

[15:26] <jnthn> Need some more data yet

[15:28] <timotimo> i have a discovery bit for hllbool

[15:28] <timotimo> but hllboolfor would also be interesting, surely

[15:29] <jnthn> tssk...can't get it to fail any more

[15:30] <brrt> jnthn: maybe jit-bisect.pl --spesh helps

[15:38] <dogbert2> jnthn: I just remembered that I had (almost) golfed the problem: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/23b5e847a19f2798352a44c582760963

[15:38] <dogbert2> if it is indeed the same one

[15:39] * dogbert2 changes location &

[15:44] <jnthn> I think it's the MVM_CF_REF_FROM_GEN2 addition

[15:52] <diakopter> I do not understand what in the world they are talking about on #perl6 .. some rakudo fork they want to be an alternative alias in the debian packages?

[16:00] <jnthn> Darn it, thought I'd got a fix, but no...

[16:02] <[Coke]> not a fork.

[16:02] <[Coke]> being able to call an installed rakudo with either `rakudo` or `perl6` instead of just `perl6`

[16:15] <ilmari> I think the point is to be able to choose which perl6 implementation gets to be /usr/bin/perl6
