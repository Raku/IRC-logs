[03:07] <samcv> timotimo, MasterDuke are there any release blockers atm for MoarVM?

[03:08] <MasterDuke> don't think so

[03:11] <MasterDuke> samcv: mostly off topic, but have you seen https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/745 ?

[03:21] <samcv> no i haven't. thanks for bringing it up

[10:10] <brrt> ohai #moarvm

[10:12] <samcv> good * brrt

[10:14] <samcv> so for shiftjit we used to use two huge switches to convert back and forth, for valid indexes and codepoints. so since the indexes are contiguous except for 11 places, i made an array and then made a table with data of where the gaps were and the length of gaps so that's much faster to compile and posibly faster than having the compiler optimize  large switch

[10:14] <samcv> but i'm unsure what to do for the reverse: because you have bsically random codeponits matching to random indexes

[10:15] *** zakharyas joined
[10:17] <samcv> looks like we save 28KB by getting rid of one of the big switches as well

[10:20] <jnthn> If they're blocky enough then a 2-level table could work

[10:21] <samcv> i mean they're really all over the place

[10:21] <samcv> sometimes there's a range of contiguous codepoints but most of it is just random since they don't map the same

[10:22] <samcv> idk. it's very long so it could be more contiguous than i think

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Use an array instead of a big switch for ShiftJIS decoding

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Since we can easily map index->codepoint, turn the big switch into an

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: array. There are only 11 gaps of the indexes, so we just check we aren't

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: in a gap and apply an offset. Makes the shiftjis files compile twice as

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: fast.

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: We still use a big switch for encoding because codepoints are not at all

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: in order, so for now let the compiler handle this.

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0ad859add8

[10:24] <jnthn> I'd left merging the PR for post-release, but I guess it's pretty safe. :-)

[10:26] <samcv> jnthn: yeah. i tested it on every possibility with the old function

[10:26] <samcv> and iterated every choice and made sure output was identical. it should make compiling faster for those with slow computers

[10:27] <samcv> dunno how many there are. i know it took forever to compile shiftjis.o when i emulated MIPS :)

[10:27] <jnthn> :-)

[10:27] <jnthn> samcv++
