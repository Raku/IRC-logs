[10:45] <dogbert2> I get a test failure containing 'JIT ERROR: Negative offset for dynamic label 50'

[10:45] <brrt> let me see..

[10:47] <dogbert2> let me add that I have commit ceea63332b9c4a2

[10:48] <brrt> I kind of hate those perl6 tests that use subprocesses

[10:49] <dogbert2> interesting, I noticed the problem when running htmlify.p6 yesterday and I believe that it also uses subprocesses

[12:56] *** albancxp joined

[12:57] <dogbert2> so now you have to figure out what's happening in the JIT

[12:58] <brrt> presumably we're not emitting some label that we expect

[12:59] <dogbert2> stupid question perhaps but how serious is this problem?

[13:00] <brrt> That depends on perspective

[13:00] <brrt> In theory, this is really bad

[13:00] <brrt> It could lead to infinite loops, missed handlers, etc

[13:00] <brrt> In practice, this particular bug is probably innocent

[13:03] <dogbert2> in that case it's a definite improvement that they are now emitted to STDOUT

[13:04] <brrt> stderr, actually

[13:04] <brrt> but yes

[13:05] <dogbert2> my bad

[16:41] <brrt> oh, I think I understand now....

[16:42] <brrt> interestingly, the error is actually in the legacy JIT

[16:43] <brrt> if we have an annotation that requires us to have a label after an opcode (as happens with inline-end labels, is that actually correct though?)

[16:43] <brrt> ... and, if that annotation is processed by the expression JIT

[16:44] <brrt> then we allocate a label for it. But if it happens to be an opcode that is processed as a block by the legacy JIT (prepargs is that way), then we don't process that annotation in the legacy JIT

[16:44] <brrt> so what happens is

[16:45] <brrt>  - we allocate a label in the expression JIT

[16:45] <brrt> - we don't have the template, so we don't emit anything

[16:45] <brrt> - the legacy JIT skips adding the label

[16:45] <brrt> - the new check screams loudly about it

[16:46] <brrt> now, I have just two questions...

[16:46] <brrt> in this case, we're seeing an inline_end annotation on a prepargs

[16:46] *** gk_ joined
[16:46] <brrt> and I was operating under the assumption that inline_end would be the *inclusive* end of the inline

[16:46] <brrt> but how can prepargs be the last opcode in the inline?

[17:31] <timotimo> perhaps it comes from a spesh plugin, brrt?

[17:31] <timotimo> hm, no, spseh plugins wouldn't have a prepargs any more

[17:34] <brrt> hmm

[17:34] <brrt> this needs to be more resilient

[17:35] <timotimo> did you look at the rules that govern how annotations move when instructions get removed?

[17:35] <brrt> did not

[17:35] <brrt> anyway, i'm off for today

[19:03] <lizmat> am I doing something wrong here ?

[19:04] <jnthn> Apparently :P

[19:05] <jnthn> I'm not sure what's happening there, though. It should be a no-op

[19:05] <jnthn> (you don't smart-match on the control exception, so it's re-thrown to the normal warn handler, which then resumes)

[19:06] <lizmat> should I ticket this.  And if so, where?  Rakudo?

[19:08] <timotimo> i believe this has been happening for many years, and people have stumbled upon it multiple times

[19:08] <jnthn> Yeah, I've seen at least similar before, if not identical

[19:08] <jnthn> It's probably even filed somewhere

[19:13] <lizmat> ok, I'll leave it then

[19:20] <lizmat> is there actually a way to export a CONTROL block ?

[19:25] <dogbert17> jnthn, lizmat: here's an old report, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/572

[19:27] <lizmat> that's weird to see: I *was* goofing around with CONTROL, having completely forgotten about the report

[19:27] <lizmat> but the code I tried was *exactly* the code I reported on Jan 10

[19:27] <lizmat> so much for memory  :-(

[19:30] <dogbert17> it has sometimes happened that when entering a room in order to accomplish a task, figured out a few seconds earlier, I have forgotten why I went there

[19:30] <dogbert17> I have to stop and think
