[09:49] <jnthn> timotimo: Disabling inlining turns a 29MB profile into a 3MB profile, so I guess things will be a good bit mroe usable once the unwind bug is fixed :)

[09:50] <jnthn> timotimo: I see that it again reports time spent in specialization...is that accurate?

[10:05] <timotimo> aye, the inlining profiling bug isn't fixed properly in its branch yet, there's still trouble

[10:05] <timotimo> i changed how specialization time is counted; the spesh worker just hangs it off of the main thread but it doesn't get removed from call graph nodes nor does it influence the total time i believe

[10:22] <dogbert2> m: try { do-that-thing-you-do(); CONTROL {} }; sub do-that-thing-you-do { warn "This is a warning";} # is it this unwind bug

[10:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar c53fde3eb: OUTPUT: «This is a warning␤MoarVM panic: Trying to unwind over wrong handler␤»

[10:23] * dogbert2 suspects that the answer is no :)

[10:32] <jnthn> timotimo: Hm, Ok. One profile I took had seemingly high specialization time

[10:32] <jnthn> timotimo: But another looks more normal so maybe the profiler is right :)

[10:36] <timotimo> i should cross-reference speshlog numbers with profile output every now and then, i'd say

[10:45] * jnthn ist in Deutschland o/ :)

[10:45] * timotimo has yet to pack his things :o

[10:45] <jnthn> Am going to overnight in Berlin :)

[10:46] <jnthn> At Dresden now, so only a bit more to go for today

[10:49] <timotimo> google maps think my drive "typically" takes between 2:50 and 4:10 at the given time

[10:49] <jnthn> That's quite some variance :)

[10:49] <timotimo> yeah, i suppose over almost 300 km there can be more than one congestion

[10:50] <jnthn> The train is at least in theory more predictable in that sense :)

[10:51] <jnthn> When I walked into the station this morning the first thing I heard was a 40 minute delay being announced. Was relieved to discover it wasn't for my train :)

[11:06] <dogbert2> jnthn: Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

[11:07] <FROGGS> :D

[11:09] <lizmat> donnerwetter!  :-)

[11:23] <jnthn> Nein! Ich kann nur bier kaufen. :P

[11:23] <lizmat> nicht trinken?  schade!  :-)

[11:23] <jnthn> :P

[11:23] <lizmat> lunch&

[11:29] <dogbert2> https://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/de/

[13:32] <lizmat> perhaps some low hanging opt fruit: it looks like atpos2d_o and friends are not JITted

[13:33] <lizmat> this would help multidim array access a lot
