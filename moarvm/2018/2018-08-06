[15:34] <timotimo> i'll have to find a sensible approach to pagination or maybe just a "load more" button would be enough

[15:35] <lizmat> but where would the "load more" come from?  From a server, or would it already live in the browser ?

[15:36] <timotimo> there's a server that can do that

[15:37] <diakopter> dogbert2: in that code, I think lexreg can move since sf can move, so the lexreg pointer chasing must be done inside the loop

[15:40] <diakopter> nwc10: I bet if you re-run it with moving that lexreg assignment inside the loop it'll work

[15:40] <lizmat> timotimo: then a "load more" button would be appropriate  :-)

[15:41] <lizmat> timotimo: but otoh it would be nice if you could send such a profile to a gist e.g.

[15:41] <lizmat> timotimo: so how would that work ?

[15:43] <timotimo> well, the server could interface with github, for example

[15:43] <timotimo> or do you mean the whole profile should go on github?

[16:00] <diakopter> nwc10: ^^

[16:03] <diakopter> apparently github thought "let's see if it fixes" means "fixes"

[16:11] <lizmat> timotimo: I was thinking of the case when people see something weird in a profile they did and they want to show it to other people

[16:12] <lizmat> until now, that would have been posting the HTML file as a gist somewhere

[16:14] <timotimo> true

[19:31] <timotimo> that doesn't look right

[19:31] <timotimo> at the point ctx_hash is allocated, sf and frame are garbage pointers

[19:31] <timotimo> uninitialized

[19:31] <timotimo> they only get initialized by find_lex_info

[19:31] <diakopter> oh right

[19:33] <diakopter> hrm

[19:33] <diakopter> ehhh how to rollback that commit :D

[19:34] <diakopter> I mean, it shouldn't break anything, but, pessimization

[19:34] <diakopter> er, actually it would break.

[19:34] <diakopter> oops.

[19:35] <diakopter> can someone revert it?

[19:35] <diakopter> or I can in the editor

[19:37] <timotimo> it can break, yeah

[21:30] <brrt> diakopter: I think the bug you wanted to fix was the correct one, but please use git proper rather than messing with the web editor, especially on master; you can't compile your edits that way

[21:31] <diakopter> brrt: yeah

[21:31] <brrt> it's no big deal :-)

[21:31] <diakopter> I think it's not the bug; rather I suspect it's something with how the lexical slots are accessed

[21:32] <diakopter> (that happens to not error most of the time)

[21:32] <brrt> well, allocating without rooting certainly could be a bug

[21:32] <brrt> what bug are we talking about?

[21:32] <diakopter> right, but as timotimo points out, those pointers are given new values in the next line anyway

[21:32] <diakopter> (and they're unitialized before that)

[21:33] <brrt> I like the idea of static analysis (although I'm afraid we're using a bit much in the way of macros for that to be performant :-))

[21:40] <timotimo> the right solution to this conundrum, with web editor and such, is obviously to compile gcc to javascript using emscripten so you can compile moarvm right there in your browser

[21:40] <brrt> obviously

[21:41] <timotimo> our most valuable developers all have something in common:

[21:41] <timotimo> they own a smart phone

[21:41] <timotimo> well, i think most of them do

[21:47] <brrt> not one that can compile moarvm :-)

[21:47] <brrt> although it isn't all that much

[21:48] <timotimo> just connect an usb stick via usb OTG and have a swap file on it

[21:48] <timotimo> or perhaps store the swap on a sufficiently big NFC tag

[21:48] <timotimo> "please touch nfc tag number 7 to the phone now"

[21:49] <timotimo> 2013 someone said "NFC tags can store upwards of 8kB of data depending on the IC, but the larger memory payloads can get expensive."

[21:49] <jnthn> I suspect mine is easily capable, hardware wise, of compiling MoarVM. It's mercifully far too locked down for me to do any such fun. :)

[21:50] <timotimo> what kind do you use?

[21:51] <jnthn> iPhone

[21:51] <timotimo> it almost sounds like the protocol in use for storing and retrieving data with NFC tags won't let you address more than 8 kbytes?

[21:51] <timotimo> yeah, those are locked pretty tight

[21:51] <jnthn> Which has worked for a bunch of years without problems, and does all I care for.

[21:52] <timotimo> mine recently got a crack in its display

[21:52] <timotimo> i'm considering upgrading, or maybe "sidegrading"

[21:52] <timotimo> i.e. getting a cheap smartphone that's still a bit more powerful than my current one

[21:53] <jnthn> My wife has some Android-based phone and it's a security shitshow. Claims its running the latest available version (I presume this means "that the vendor makes available"...)

[21:53] <timotimo> yeah, vendors can be pretty bad about that

[21:53] <jnthn> But then gets itself infected within a week or two with poker games and who knows what else :/

[21:53] <timotimo> for many devices there's community-managed custom roms

[21:53] <timotimo> but .. mehhh

[21:54] <timotimo> i have not yet had a security problem with any of my android phones, but i'm just a little paranoid

[21:55] <jnthn> Well yeah, for the most part I just want my smartphone to do its routine/boring things and do so reliably.

[21:55] <timotimo> as in i refrain from doing stuff normal users would probably want to be able to do, but that might be risky in some way

[21:56] <jnthn> Not have to mess around fixing it

[21:56] <timotimo> i'd actually be interested in playing the odd game every now and then

[21:56] <timotimo> right

[21:56] <timotimo> i mean i could also schlepp my nintendo 3ds around with me and get into homebrew development ... there isn't really amazing homebrew games for that out yet

[21:57] <timotimo> where saying "yet" makes it sounds like "it's just because the system hasn't had homebrew for long", but some people are already calling the system dead %)

[21:58] <jnthn> I used to carry around a monocular so that I could read information boards at public transport locations and road name signs placed uncomfortably high and so on (since I've got pretty awful eyesight). Now I just carry the smartphone and see all the information on that. So I rather care that it works, because I could be quite literally lost without it. :-)

[21:59] <timotimo> rightfully so

[21:59] <timotimo> i believe i've seen a service out there, an app plus volunteers, that lets a volunteer "be your eyes" through your phone's back-facing camera

[22:00] <timotimo> accessibility and assistive technologies is quite an interesting space

[22:00] <diakopter> jnthn: I carry a fully-charged backup phone since dropping my phone once left me stranded for hours :O

[22:00] <timotimo> oh damn

[22:00] <timotimo> that's an experience i'd not like to have

[22:00] <jnthn> Yeah, it seems the kind of tech that smartphones and tablets have made cheap and portable is quite useful for assistive stuff, which is a nice side-effect. :)

[22:03] <jnthn> I also have nystagmus, which isn't a very big deal, but does mean that my eyes don't fixate. Went to teach at a company that does eye tracking and they were saying "oh, and it's good for lots of accessibility things", then none of their demos would work on me at all. :D

[22:03] <timotimo> oooh, i haven't heard of that yet

[22:04] <lizmat> and another Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/2018-32-squashathon-done/

[22:05] <jnthn> Another bug down

[22:05] <jnthn> oh, not this window :)
