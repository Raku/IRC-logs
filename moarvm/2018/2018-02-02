[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Add windows-1251 (Cyrillic) decode/encode. Fix bug in windows-1252

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We now have support for windows-1251 decoding and encoding.

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This also fixes a bug with windows-1252 (Latin) which would cause

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: certain codepoints not to convert properly, for example the â„¢ mark and

[01:41] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: likely at least one other.

[05:45] <samcv> fun! i got to use function passing for the first time. will i tried it before but not yet on any serious projects

[05:46] <samcv> so i can combine the decoding functions for win-1251 and 1252

[05:48] <samcv> reduces the code size by 4KB

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Refactor so code is not duped between windows-1251 & 1252

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We pass the codetable and/or the cp_to_char() function for the

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: respective encoding into a more general purpose function. May eventually

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: be able to work the other 1-byte encodings into code similar to this.

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Throw on invalid windows-1251/1252 during encode and decode

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Previously we could create and read invalid windows-1251 and

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: windows-1252. Now we throw both on encode or on decode if encountering a

[07:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: codepoint with no mapping.

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Default to not throw on windows-1251/2 decode/encode errors

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This is currently configurable with a #define. This reverts the changed

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: functionality of the previous commit back to the old functionality.

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[23:58] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Later we will make this configurable at runtime.
