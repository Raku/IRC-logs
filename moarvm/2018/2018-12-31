[14:16] <brrt> \o

[14:19] <brrt> I couldn't sleep last night and had a bunch of ideas

[14:19] <brrt> - We add a type, and a set of opcodes, for 'resources', which (unlike objects) are refcounted

[14:20] <brrt> e.g. rather than 'assign_o' you'd have 'assign_r'

[14:21] <brrt> this is probably more dificult than I imagine it to be

[14:21] <brrt> but it might be a thing

[14:22] <brrt> - For floating point support, we strictly don't need a STORE_NUM operator, because the tiler will select the right variant there. But it is probably still better, for consistency and simplicity of implementation, to have it anyway

[14:22] <brrt> OTOH, IF/COPY/DO, do not really need it, I can add a polymorphic tile definition and it'll work

[15:24] <brrt> .ask lizmat if you can either check if you can compile jit-expr-float on macOS, given that mininlua needs -lm everywhere but macOS apparently doesn't have it

[15:24] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[15:25] <lizmat> --gen-moar=jit-expr-float should do the trick ?

[15:25] <yoleaux> 15:24Z <brrt> lizmat: if you can either check if you can compile jit-expr-float on macOS, given that mininlua needs -lm everywhere but macOS apparently doesn't have it

[15:27] <brrt> i have no idea

[15:27] <brrt> try it out :-)

[15:30] <lizmat> error: pathspec 'moar=jit-expr-float' did not match any file(s) known to git.

[15:30] <brrt> ehm

[15:31] <brrt> well, 'moar=jit-expr-float' isn't the name of the branch ;-)

[15:32] <lizmat> argh

[15:33] <brrt> btw, what is the current state of plan regarding perl and FOSDEM?

[15:33] <lizmat> yeah, --gen-moar=...  works better than -gen=moar

[15:33] <lizmat> building...

[15:34] <lizmat> brrt: states "Switched to a new branch 'jit-expr-float'" and builds ok after that

[15:34] <lizmat> note: this is on High Sierra, not Mojave

[15:34] <notable6> lizmat, Noted!

[15:35] <lizmat> thank you notable6  :-)

[15:35] <brrt> hmmm

[15:35] <lizmat> maybe when it fails, the MacOS doesn't have XCode installed ?

[15:36] <lizmat> (as seen earlier today on #perl6)

[15:36] <brrt> I really don't know.... I just know that I read somewhere on the internet that macOS doesn't know what to do with -lm

[15:36] <brrt> which is the only lib that minilua needs

[15:37] <brrt> (and I could build it without, because I don't think DynASM really uses sqrt etc)

[15:41] <lizmat> brrt: want me to gist the build log ?

[15:43] <brrt> please, yes

[15:45] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/525c9acaf89bafd188bf64e7d600439e  # brrt

[15:53] <brrt> thank you

[15:54] <brrt> lizmat: seems like you didn't have to build minilua?

[15:55] <lizmat> indeed

[15:58] <brrt> hmm

[15:59] <brrt> that's unfortunate because that is the very thing i need to check :-)

[16:02] <lizmat> brrt: perhaps I should nuke some directory ?

[16:03] <brrt> ehm.... the MoarVM directory itself?

[16:03] <brrt> or delete MoarVM/3rdparty/dynasm/minilua

[16:08] <lizmat> removed the directory and it doesn't get re-created...

[16:08] * lizmat nukes MoarVM

[16:09] <lizmat> also had to nuke "install"

[16:17] <brrt> ☢️

[16:23] <lizmat> all builds ok for me

[16:25] *** Ven` left
[16:25] <brrt> \o/

[16:26] <brrt> okay, ehm, I'm inclined to push that patch to master then

[16:26] <brrt> I'd be so surprised if macOS didn't accept -lm. That has worked forever everywhere

[16:26] <lizmat> we still have some time before the next release :-)

[16:26] <brrt> indeed
