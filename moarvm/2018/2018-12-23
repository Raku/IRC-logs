[11:27] <dogbert17> nine: what should we do with the failing tests in integration/precompiled.t?

[11:34] <nine> dogbert17: which test fails exactly?

[11:41] <dogbert17> test #2 - precomp_loads_ok is working

[11:42] <dogbert17> the error being 'Could not find p6testmod8D1090D3 at line 0 in: /tmp/p6testmod67682BCF - in sub do_compunit at /home/dogbert/repos/rakudo/t/spec/packages/Test-Helpers/lib/Test/Compile.pm6 (Test::Compile) line 266'

[12:32] <timotimo> invalidate the cache when something gets added in-process?

[13:11] <nine> The test needs to write the module files before creating the repository object

[13:25] <dogbert17> nine: that would mean that there's nothing wrong woth your patch. Will you commit it or should I make a PR?

[14:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Support endian switching in writenum and readnum

[14:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/1404d51680

[14:56] <nine> So I fixed the endian issues with writenum and readnum. Alas they are not the reason for rakudo's build failure on big endian machines :/

[15:15] <nine> I'm really not sure if the build failure is related to the new mbc backend at all. All .nqp files now compile to exactly the same result (according to md5sum on the .moarvm files).

[15:53] <nine> And it really isn't! It's a spesh bug

[15:54] <dogbert17> uh oh

[15:56] <nine> WRT to rakudo making it into the next Debian release, does this mean, that it can be achieved by just building with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 on affected architectures?

[16:21] <nine> Yep, build completes with spesh disabled :)
