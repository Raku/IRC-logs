[14:01] <timotimo> oh, jnthn, the ThreadPoolScheduler should probably catch failure to create a new thread, right? rather than the program dying?

[14:02] <jnthn> I guess we could just note that in the scheduler debug log (if enabled), yes

[14:02] <timotimo> and maybe not try to create a thread ~100 times a second :)
