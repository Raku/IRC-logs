[02:06] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i thought maybe it was my MoarVM PR that renamed getstrfromname that caused my nqp branch to not build, but reverting it didn't help. any thought about what it might have been instead before i just trying manually bisecting?

[16:11] <jnthn> Well, that's a new low

[16:11] <timotimo> o_O

[16:12] <timotimo> the more i work on the profiler frontend, the more i'd like to build a spesh log viewer

[16:13] <timotimo> maybe TPF wouldn't be too strongly against accepting another grant proposal from me after the profiler one is finished

[16:13] <timotimo> though the spesh viewer wouldn't be quite as useful to regular perl6 users

[16:13] <timotimo> compared to the profiler anyway

[16:14] <jnthn> Yeah, I think it's too much info for most folks

[16:14] <timotimo> that's where a viewer program could help, though

[16:15] <timotimo> make the specializations themselves the "center", show facts and spesh slot contents when you hover/click the operand, show the logged info when hovering/clicking the "logged" annotations

[16:15] <timotimo> point out the exact location in the "before" code for deopt annotations

[16:16] <timotimo> something for the "deopt=" data, too

[16:19] <timotimo> the spesh log to graphviz one wasn't terrible, but it's really, really, really hard to see what's going on

[16:20] <jnthn> Yeah, even better if we can interleave source code with spesh'd results

[16:20] <timotimo> true

[16:20] <timotimo> huh, only 10% improvement on that benchmark? that doesn't seem like enough

[16:21] <jnthn> Well, it's not like GC is the only thing going on in there :)

[16:21] <timotimo> true, but i was assuming it was getting pathological performance due to GC runs being basically doubled

[16:22] <jnthn> True, it was very GC heavy

[16:22] <jnthn> But still not to the degree GC took 50% of the runtime or something

[16:23] <timotimo> what does your code for that benchmark look like? i'm trying 'my @a = 1 xx 10_000_000; say @a[*-1]' right now

[16:23] *** stmuk joined
[16:23] <timotimo> though that perhaps benefits from the int cache a bit too much

[16:43] <timotimo> so, i'm wondering: can we do some kind of trick to make worklist creation for VMArray much faster? like, the index is "just" incrementing by a pointer each time, the other content is basically just a memcpy of the array content, if it is contiguously non-null

[16:44] <timotimo> i wonder if perhaps worklist would be more efficient if it were contiguous collectable-pointers and contiguous collectable-pointer-pointers

[16:44] <timotimo> if that allows us tricks like that

[16:45] <timotimo> if it's even worth anything

[16:51] <jnthn> Well, it's only a memcpy when we don't need to include the gen2

[16:52] <timotimo> you mean when we do need to include the gen2?

[16:52] <timotimo> otherwise we'd have to filter things out?

[16:53] <timotimo> but we'd also have to leave out null pointers, so it's only really doable if we know we can get away with that

[16:53] <timotimo> perhaps that's a topic for another year, or for another person
