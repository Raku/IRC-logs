[14:10] <timotimo> also, perhaps it's not understanding the heap snapshot format correctly any more?

[14:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/4666ff437e

[14:15] <timotimo> looking forward to having automated sanity tests for the profilers at some point %)

[14:16] <brrt> I think we're nearing the stage that we need to have tests for MoarVM....

[14:17] <brrt> This morning, I had the mad plan of having inline expression templates

[14:17] <brrt> does ` do anything in C?

[14:17] * brrt should get himself K&R at some point

[14:38] <timotimo> ` didn't exist back then :P

[14:39] <timotimo> that commit id is beautiful

[14:42] <dogbert2_> didn't it use to be possible to run a single spectest file using make, e.g. 'make t/spec/S32-list/seq.t' ?

[14:51] <timotimo> yeah i think so

[14:56] <timotimo> man, i need better programs to run the profiler on

[16:10] <Zoffix> .ask brrt does R#2395 (Proc.in.close hang/long time) sound like anything you may have worked on or do you have any ideas about that ticket? I saw some commits about event loops in MoarVM. Dunno if that's what's involved in handling closing of STDIN for a proc (it uses Proc::Async under the hood)

[16:10] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[18:36] <Zoffix> ins->operands[2].lit_i16 = repr_data->attribute_offsets[repr_data->unbox_num_slot];

[18:37] <Zoffix> Does that look right? "lit_i16" being assigned a "unbox_num_slot"? Like int vs num innit?

[18:37] <Zoffix> looks like that's used everywhere… never mfind.
