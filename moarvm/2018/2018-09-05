[00:37] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any idea why https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e82d35e40455a49372f449769fedf684 would cause `Argument "Expected 3 operands and 0 params, got 0" isn't numeric in addition (+) at tools/expr-template-compiler.pl line 257, <STDIN> line 2399.` ?

[00:38] <timotimo> sounds like an error not being properly output'd

[00:40] <timotimo> not sure what's wrong in the templates

[00:42] <MasterDuke> hm, if i remove the macro i get `Mismatched type, got reg expected voidfor do (decodertakebytes ARRAY(0x5600ac023b60)) at tools/expr-template-compiler.pl line 286, <STDIN> line 2398.`

[00:59] <MasterDuke> timotimo: the `Expected 3 operands and 0 params, got 2` comes from the macro call

[01:00] <timotimo> why, though?

[01:00] <MasterDuke> i thought maybe it was the string, so i changed it to (const_ptr "foo") and same error

[01:00] <MasterDuke> and same with just (tc)

[01:03] <MasterDuke> i'm trying changes in the macro itself, but nothing i do changes the error

[01:04] <timotimo> i'd have to defer to brrt :(

[13:25] <brrt> I've decided to ignore the debugserver thread for the purposes of fork()

[13:25] <brrt> and...

[13:26] <brrt> (as in, if there is a debugserver thread, we're not going to do fork(), atm)

[13:27] *** AlexDaniel left
[13:33] <timotimo> fwiw, the debug server client is supposed to already cope with disconnection of the server ... or at least i seem to remember that

[13:49] <brrt> that's fine; the problem is I can't *stop* the debug server thread :-)

[13:49] <brrt> becuase there is no safe, portable way to interrupt a thread waiting on accept()

[13:49] <brrt> or at least, I don't htink there is

[13:52] <timotimo> oh, i remember that

[13:53] <timotimo> hm, so how does libuv implement accepting listen sockets?

[13:53] <timotimo> they can't "only accept if there's a socket trying to connect", or can they?

[14:06] <geekosaur> if it's O_NONBLOCK accept() would return EAGAIN if nothing's in the listen queue

[14:07] *** lizmat left
[14:07] <brrt> yeah, but it is blocking

[14:07] <brrt> libuv can do accept(), yes

[14:08] <brrt> but I don't want to have to rewrite the debugserver today :-)

[14:13] <timotimo> um, why don't we just connect to the socket locally to get out of the accept?
