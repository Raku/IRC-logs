[00:03] <samcv> jnthn: releases page is updated now :)

[00:03] <samcv> homepage too

[00:03] <samcv> cleaning up the script I wrote to generate the releases page at least

[00:03] <samcv> changed the home page manually

[00:04] <jnthn> :-)

[00:05] <jnthn> That's still a huge reduction in the work needed to keep it updated

[00:05] <samcv> yes!

[01:27] <MasterDuke> now that we've had the release any objection to someone merging https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/785 ?

[01:27] <yoleaux> 25 Jan 2018 07:17Z <brrt> MasterDuke: seeing it, I will check it out as well. I was hoping you'd find bugs like these :-)

[01:28] <MasterDuke> .tell brrt cool. what do you think about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/787 (sp_findmeth template)? should it be merged as is, or are you working on a different fix (than marking the op invokish)?

[02:32] <MasterDuke> i have another 6 or 7 templates so far in a branch, but i'm waiting to see if the box_i fix will be simple before i create the PR

[02:42] <MasterDuke> timotimo: want to look at a segv inducing getdynlex template?

[02:54] <timotimo> probably going to sleep too soon for that :|

[02:54] <timotimo> but if you paste it i'll have a look tomorrow

[03:00] <timotimo> the lexical_registry in the cur_frame->static_info->body.lexical_names seems broken?

[03:06] <timotimo> hm, ok, so

[03:07] <timotimo> the template is supposed to call MVM_frame_getdynlex with cur_frame's caller, right?

[03:08] <timotimo> >>> print cur_frame

[03:08] <timotimo> $33 = (MVMFrame *) 0x7ffff7fd4068

[03:08] <timotimo> >>> print tc->cur_frame->caller

[03:08] <timotimo> $34 = (MVMFrame *) 0x7ffff6593c28

[03:08] <timotimo> however!

[03:08] <timotimo> >>> print tc->cur_frame

[03:08] <timotimo> $35 = (MVMFrame *) 0x7ffff7fd4030

[03:08] <timotimo> see the cur_frame that got passed from the template is just a couple bytes offset from the cur_frame

[03:08] <timotimo> *maybe* that's broken. or maybe that's just because it's on the stack memory region

[03:09] <timotimo> m: say 0x7ffff7fd4030 - 0x7ffff7fd4068

[03:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar a2499c90f: OUTPUT: «-56␤»

[03:09] <timotimo> an MVMFrame is 184 bytes long

[03:10] <timotimo> MasterDuke: i think the ^caller macro requires a (load ...)

[03:10] <timotimo> or maybe instead of addr it should have a getf

[03:11] <timotimo> ^caller is only used in callercode, and i'm not sure if that's currently exprjitted anywhere

[03:12] <timotimo> cool

[03:12] <timotimo> (macro: ^caller () (^getf (^frame) MVMFrame caller))

[03:12] <timotimo> with this replacing the ^caller macro it seems to get much further in the nqp making

[03:12] <timotimo> MasterDuke: ^- go forth and make things awesome :)

[03:12] * timotimo off to bed

[03:13] <timotimo> also, it's not entirely unlikely that the ^params macro wants to be changed the same way
