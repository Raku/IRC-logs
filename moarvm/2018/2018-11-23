[13:59] <yoleaux> 22 Nov 2018 02:17Z <kiwi_95> brrt: (and jnthn) I'd love to read your take on "join points" and "basic blocks with arguments" as discussed here https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/9z8qu3/a_new_compiler_backend_called_cranelift_uses/

[14:00] <brrt> .tell kiwi_95 - I'm honestly not personally sufficiently advanced that I could tell you what the difference really is

[14:00] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to kiwi_95.

[14:00] <brrt> in practical terms. It seems pretty equivalent to me

[14:02] <brrt> .ask nine I wonder if you can help me make a test case for nativecallinvoke, and maybe start thinking about deprecating the difference between nativeinvoke, nativeclallinvoke and plain invoke

[14:02] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to nine.
