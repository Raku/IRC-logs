[00:25] <timotimo> i'm going through interp.c and i'm finding sooo many ops that are not being instrumented for allocation logging

[00:33] <MasterDuke> timotimo++

[00:33] <MasterDuke> could that somehow be marked in the oplist?

[00:40] <timotimo> i've considered that, too

[01:32] <timotimo> tomorrow i should have an extra look at whether threads that don't participate in a given gc run are completely losing their data in the profiler at the moment

[01:33] <timotimo> like, since they don't show up in the gc's list of threads, are the number properly added to the threads that actually do the work? i don't think they are

[01:34] <timotimo> and perhaps i should change it to record the data of all threads' nurseries and have the "participated" flag be just whether or not the thread was part of the parallel mark&sweep process

[12:31] <brrt> \o

[12:31] <brrt> nine++ - for finishing

[12:32] <brrt> having said that, istr that there was a reason we didn't have sp_findmeth in the expr JIT yet

[12:32] <brrt> I may be wrong about that

[13:25] <nine> It seems to work just fine ;)

[13:27] <nine> brrt: did you see my findings about expr jit of "set"?

[13:27] <brrt> no

[13:27] <brrt> did not

[13:27] <brrt> what's up with that?

[13:28] <brrt> yeah, maybe it wasn't sp_findmeth after all :-)

[13:28] <nine> Causes: MoarVM panic: Register types do not match between value and node in t/spec/S02-names-vars/list_array_perl.t when ran with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[13:29] <brrt> oh, hmmm

[13:29] <brrt> alright, I'll need to take a look I guess :-)

[13:29] <nine> I'd not be surprised if its about some signed/unsigned mismatch

[13:30] <brrt> :-)

[13:30] <nine> My mbc backend seems to be one of the heaviest users of unsigneds we have

[13:30] <brrt> uhuh

[13:41] <dogbert17> nine: was the 'It seems to work just fine ;)' directed to brrt or do you not get the valgrind warnings?

[13:42] <dogbert17> if so I must have made a mistake (or two :-) when building your branch

[13:43] <nine> dogbert17: was refering to brrt

[13:43] <dogbert17> phew :)

[14:00] <brrt> nine: the sp_findmeth legacy jit template looks decidedly normal, so I'm sure I'm misrenembering things

[14:00] <nine> good to hear :)
