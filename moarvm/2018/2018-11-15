[08:43] <nwc10> jnthn: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/582237 - that test case, wtih ASAN's excitement

[08:43] <nwc10> I needed to set MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[08:43] <nwc10> I can't currerntly build rakudo with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[08:43] <nwc10> and NQP fails 3 tests

[09:45] <nwc10> I hope that the cause for both the bug tested here and the rakudo build failure turns out to be the same

[10:23] <yoleaux> 11 Nov 2018 10:59Z <nine> brrt: t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t is failing occasionally with 'Register types do not match between value and node' at the end after all tests passed. Error goes away completely with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 which makes me believe that we're trying to JIT compile while already shutting down the VM.

[10:23] <brrt> nine: noted

[10:23] <brrt> that is weird though

[20:16] <nine> .tell brrt scratch that idea of JITing while interp shutdown. We don't reach the end of MVM_interp_run and not even the FUDGED! message in t/spec/S06-advanced/callframe.rakudo.moar. But in all cases, we finish all tests.

[20:16] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to brrt.
