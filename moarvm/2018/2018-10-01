[06:12] <brrt> \o

[06:12] <yoleaux> 30 Sep 2018 17:49Z <MasterDuke> brrt: for function calls in templates, would there ever be anything in the arglist other than cargs? if not, would it makes to try and remove some of that boilerplate?

[06:13] <brrt> .tell MasterDuke no, and no, because the (carg) structure is tightly bound to how the tree is represented and interpreted in memory

[06:13] <yoleaux> brrt: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[06:13] <brrt> samcv: what did you do when you saw the JIT error?

[06:13] <brrt> btw, this is exactly why I made that noisy

[06:16] <brrt> negative offsets are very, very scary buts

[06:17] <samcv> uh i posted it above

[06:18] <samcv>  for <PRIMARY SECONDARY TERTIARY> { say 0x385.uniprop("MVM_COLLATION$_".base(16)) }

[06:18] <samcv> it's consistent for me

[06:19] <brrt> thank you

[08:38] <nwc10> \o

[08:41] <timotimo> mroing

[08:42] <brrt> a frame handler end annotation is placed on a PHI node

[08:43] <timotimo> that'd probably do it if the jit doesn't count phis as zero-width, right?

[08:43] <timotimo> i've seen phi nodes in the middle of BBs a few times

[08:43] <brrt> well, in the case of the expr JIT, they're just skipped

[08:43] <brrt> I think that'd be because a bb merge of some sort

[08:45] <timotimo> it'd have to

[08:45] <timotimo> an extra question is: if the BBs were merged, there has to have been only one pred, so why was the PHI still there :)

[08:49] <jnthn> I'd have thought handler motion could do that for quite a long time...

[10:08] <dogbert2> hmm, quite a few test failures all of a sudden

[10:08] <dogbert2> e.g. t/05-messages/moar/01-errors.t

[10:09] <dogbert2>     not ok 2 - MVM_JIT_LOG    # Failed test 'MVM_JIT_LOG'

[10:11] <timotimo> brrt removed the jit log, didn't he?

[10:11] <timotimo> or is that still to come?

[10:13] <dogbert2> aha, that might explain it

[10:15] <dogbert2> test looks easily fixed though

[10:15] <dogbert2> if support for MVM_JIT_LOG has in fact been removed that is

[10:17] <timotimo> hum, i don't see a commit for it though
