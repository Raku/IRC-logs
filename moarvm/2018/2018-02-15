[13:43] <dogbert2> very silent here today

[13:43] <brrt> good * dogbert2

[13:43] <dogbert2> hello brrt

[13:44] <dogbert2> brrt are you working on the JIT or $work

[13:45] <brrt> $dayjob

[13:48] *** zakharyas joined
[13:48] <dogbert2> same here, but I still managed to get hold of some gdb information for https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/800

[13:49] <dogbert2> perhaps you, timotimo or jnthn can see what might be going wrong there

[13:50] <dogbert2> it's a 'good' bug in the sense that it is easy to reproduce

[13:51] <timotimo> hm, so it's crashing deep inside an exception being printed while .perl-ing some datastructure

[13:54] <dogbert2> timotimo: perhaps it's trying to print out the error message that the reporter got during one of his runs

[13:54] <dogbert2> "Type check failed in binding to parameter '$start'; expected XML::Node but got Array ..."

[13:54] <dogbert2> valgrinding it now

[21:49] <Geth> ¬¶ MoarVM:

[21:49] <Geth> ¬¶ MoarVM: The JIT has always had a huge problem with the 'if_o' object

[21:49] <Geth> ¬¶ MoarVM: conditional branches because they are both branching and invokish. In

[21:49] <Geth> ¬¶ MoarVM: the interpreter, the MVM_coerce_istrue function can set up a return

[21:49] <Geth> ¬¶ MoarVM: handler for an invokish frame to pick the correct code to branch

[21:51] <brrt> this fixes‚Ä¶ https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1483

[21:52] <brrt> thanks AlexDaniel for giving a good clean test case

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> what test case?

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> ooooooh

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> that one wasn't found by me!

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> but I can give you a thousand line project with 300 line test file that does the same!

[21:53] <jnthn> brrt++ # really nice commit message explaining it too

[21:53] <brrt> who found it then? (credit where it is due)

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> saramaebee on #perl6

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2018-02-05#i_15780500

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> a few messages later it segfaulted

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> brrt: I can now bump nqp and moar, right?

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> brrt: thank you very much for the fix!

[22:02] <brrt> I think you can try. No warranties given :-)

[22:05] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[22:08] <brrt> seeing breakage?

[22:11] <AlexDaniel> no, so far so good. I'll be able to tell better once toaster finishes :)

[22:11] <AlexDaniel> the ‚Äúhmm‚Äù was about weird compilation warning that I noticed, but that was with an older version‚Ä¶

[22:11] <brrt> ok

[22:37] <MasterDuke> .ask brrt does https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c7774e37d2 fix the getlexstatic_o template also?

[22:37] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to brrt.
