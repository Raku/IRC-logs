[04:56] <samcv> going to be adding a new decoderconfigure op that will let us configure the decoder with a replacement

[04:57] <samcv> interestingly we have two encoders one for replacement and one without. i wonder if it may make sense to turn those two into the same class

[05:03] <samcv> hmm since it has a config hash i may be able to just use that

[08:04] <FROGGS_> timotimo: damn, a bunch of tests hang forever on my mipsel machine... both for nqp and rakudo

[08:07] * FROGGS_ tries again with TEST_JOBS set to 1

[08:08] *** domidumont joined
[08:10] <FROGGS_> hmmm, hangs again

[08:10] <FROGGS_> I believe that run/Proc-stuff is busted

[08:16] <FROGGS_> I'll build 2018.01 to see if it behaves the same

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: hey

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: can you finalize the big endian branch and merge it into master?

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: according to dod38fr++ your tweak actually fixes the build: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1257#issuecomment-372117450

[16:32] <AlexDaniel> now that doesn't guarantee that there are no other issuesâ€¦

[16:34] <AlexDaniel> because it basically fixed the build on 2017.06

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> but I guess we'll know eventually if there are any other issues

[16:54] <timotimo> i don't know what it needs to be finalized?
