[10:28] <lizmat> already done :-)

[10:29] <lizmat> seems to have a positive effect on setting compilation

[10:29] <lizmat> maybe 1..2 seconds shorter (it feels anyway, still a lot of noise if I'm doing other things at the same time)

[10:41] <brrt> cool

[10:45] <timotimo> because of the latest exprjit ops?

[10:46] <timotimo> if so that'd be pretty impressiv

[10:52] <brrt> yeah, jstuder++

[10:59] <timotimo> i imagined that's mostly used in frames that run mostly once, like, to set up some constants

[11:02] <brrt> maybe it unblocks some things, I don't know

[11:26] <lizmat> perhaps that happened before, but I just didn't see it

[11:26] <lizmat> perhaps installing just got faster
