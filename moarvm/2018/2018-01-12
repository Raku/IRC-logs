[03:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Try to use egcc when compiling on OpenBSD

[03:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[03:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: egcc's a package providing an up-to-date version of gcc in OpenBSD,

[03:10] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: which still uses v4.2 at the moment

[15:37] <Kaiepi> ahhhh fuck

[15:37] <Kaiepi> travis uses ubuntu, right?

[15:38] <jnthn> Yes, and recently changed something about hte image, which was upset our .travis.yml :S

[15:40] <Kaiepi> classic travis

[15:42] <Kaiepi> trying to test go with it is infuriating since it'll fail for utterly baffling reasons when tests work fine locally

[15:42] <Kaiepi> even on ubuntu

[18:24] <Kaiepi> may not be realted, but i really need to brush up on my c and perl to work on moarvm proper

[18:25] <Kaiepi> do you guys have any sugestions for books to read?

[18:25] <timotimo> the book i started learning c++ with (yeah, before c) .. i wouldn't recommend :)

[20:44] * nine learned C using Borland's Turbo C on DOS, so that wouldn't be useful ;)

[20:45] <geekosaur> some ancient book I can't remember (from 1980. thin paperback, green cover, that's all I remember. wasn't very good), then K&R, then K&P. probably also not useful.

[20:50] * lizmat was given K&R second edition and a week to learn at the time  :-)

[20:50] <yoleaux> 15:23Z <Zoffix> lizmat: RE https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2018-01-12#i_15683355   No idea. It might be a bug that needs filing ( https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org/issues/new ). It's possible travis handling isn't implemented for CPAN dists at all.

[20:50] <yoleaux> 15:24Z <Zoffix> lizmat: (and on dist page it shows up only because it's rendering markdown as-is and the badge shows up; it has no knowledge that there's a travis badge on the page)

[20:52] <jnthn> Pretty sure I learned from some O'Reilly book; it probably still exists, but surely in a newer edition :)

[22:56] <Zoffix> .tell Kaiepi RE: C book. I'm currently learning using this one http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html It was recommended by regulars in ##c channel and it's an almost perfect book (the imperfection is exercises often re-use code from exercises of previous chapters and if you don't feel like doing a particular program, you can't just skip it, because you'll come across it later again)

[22:56] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to Kaiepi.
