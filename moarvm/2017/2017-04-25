[05:51] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[05:53] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[06:08] <samcv> hi brrt

[06:09] <brrt> hi samcv

[06:26] *** TimToady joined
[06:42] *** brrt joined
[06:43] <brrt> blegh, blogging is hard

[06:46] <samcv> hah

[06:46] <samcv> just type "words words words words words"

[06:46] <samcv> that's all there is to it!

[06:55] <brrt> lol

[06:55] <brrt> i have no idea how some people can write soo much

[06:56] <brrt> case in point: jvns.ca

[07:06] <timotimo> it's easier to edit than it is to write

[07:06] <timotimo> so start off with some obvious BS

[07:07] <brrt> hmmm

[07:07] <brrt> had not considered that

[07:07] <brrt> actually

[07:07] <brrt> i way-to-often remove large pieces of text

[07:07] <mst> step 1. knock out a first draft without stopping or editing anything

[07:08] <mst> step 2. set an alarm for 10 minutes

[07:08] <mst> step 3. when the alarm goes off, stop editing and publish it

[07:08] <mst> step 4. be amazed that people still think it's a reasonable post

[07:09] <timotimo> https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/ - this has a mode that won't allow you to delete or backspace

[07:10] <timotimo> "hemmingway mode"

[07:10] <timotimo> i have been meaning to try this in earnest

[07:13] <timotimo> get it? :|

[07:15] * nwc10 groans

[07:16] <mst> I was TRYING to pretend I hadn't noticed

[07:16] <nwc10> also, not sure if anyone is going to be able to make a follow up pun

[07:16] <mst> possibly I underestimated how much importance you attached to your pun

[07:16] <timotimo> sorry about that

[07:18] <brrt> lol

[07:18] <brrt> hmmm

[07:18] <brrt> there is a point to what you're saying

[07:19] <brrt> i don't really know better than the wider internet what is and what isn't a good post

[07:26] <timotimo> sounds like what you want is A/B testing

[07:27] <mst> really, you want to publish both and not worry :)

[07:29] <timotimo> pardon me, "publish both"?

[07:29] <timotimo> i'd expect more like "you want to both publish and not worry"

[07:32] <brrt> well, i say that 'publish and not worry' sounds pretty seductive

[07:36] <timotimo> you don't plan on posting anything pitchfork-and-torch-mob-inducing, do you? :)

[07:36] <mst> timotimo: publish the A and the B and leave them both up

[07:38] *** vendethiel- joined
[07:38] <timotimo> ah

[07:38] <timotimo> that's certainly easier to implement

[07:38] <timotimo> i should be getting ready to head out the door

[07:38] <timotimo> toodles~

[07:39] <timotimo> looking forward to that blergperst

[14:35] <timotimo> huh, no way. i removed decont_all and put deconts all over my code and now it's much slower?

[14:35] <timotimo> well, i'm using <> so maybe that's it?

[14:37] <timotimo> hm. getting rid of decont_all didn't make it that much faster

[15:51] <timotimo> not rendering makes the program finish its workload 2x faster :|

[15:58] <MasterDuke_> this your SDL shooter demo?

[16:00] <timotimo> nah, a cellular-automata-like thing

[16:01] <MasterDuke_> fun

[16:02] <timotimo> except it takes almost 20 seconds to calculate and render 100 frames

[16:03] <timotimo> 85x65 cells

[16:03] <MasterDuke_> !

[17:32] <timotimo> it's still running

[17:32] <timotimo> did i make a mistake?

[17:39] <timotimo> yeah, i accidentally wronged a loop

[17:39] <timotimo> but it did end up slower than before

[17:44] * japhb imagines the loop as a trigger-happy 18th century dueler, removing a loop variable to slap timotimo with in order to officially challenge him for redress of his wrongs

[17:45] <japhb> .oO( "You, sir, SHALL NOT WRONG ME AGAIN!" )

[17:45] <timotimo> "my name is forloop montoya."

[17:45] <japhb> :-D

[17:46] <timotimo> it took me ages to finally see this movie

[17:46] <japhb> "You infinilooped my OUTER, prepare to die()!"

[17:46] <timotimo> i should definitely have watched it earlier

[17:46] <japhb> Yes, yes indeed.  :-)

[17:47] <japhb> Good as is or references aplenty, and makes excellent cinememes too.

[17:49] <timotimo> yup, all-around a good movie

[21:00] <japhb> Mind you, the current record for that one is not *quite* a single day, so we still have some work to do.

[21:47] <mst> timotimo: not a lot but I think I mostly pointed out holes, my fixes weren't actually good

[21:47] <mst> I really need to take a weekend to redo them and see how much now works

[21:47] <mst> but I keep getting distracted by other projects
