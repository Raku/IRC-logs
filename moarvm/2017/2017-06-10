[09:42] <samcv> oh jnthn interestingly those linker scripts, i think the ruby implementation of libffi actually wrote some ruby code to parse those. so it seems this problem is not unique

[09:42] <samcv> would have been nice if *cough* the library loading framework did this library loading functionality

[09:42] <samcv> but alas

[09:43] <samcv> looks like gentoo and freebsd at least use linker scripts

[10:41] <jnthn> samcv: Oh, interesting

[10:41] <jnthn> That at least means somebody else was crazy enough to try and make stuff Just Work :)

[10:43] <samcv> :)

[10:44] <samcv> see this issue here: https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/308

[10:44] <samcv> links to part of their codebase where they parse it in case it fails

[10:44] <samcv> in the 2nd post

[10:47] <jnthn> Hm, not much code to try and do that

[10:51] <samcv> but yeah essentialy we are mostly looking for 'GROUP ( /usr/lib/real.so )'

[10:51] <samcv> and that's it

[10:52] <samcv> so just have to extract that part from the linker script

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Point spilling was supposed to be an optimization for rare function

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: call paths, but it interacted really poorly with full-spilling and

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: judging from the generated code was just as often a pessimization.

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: So I've decided to remove it, simplifying the ARGLIST preparing code,

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: which I've also fixed.

[16:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: I intend to optimize spilling separately, making sure a value is
