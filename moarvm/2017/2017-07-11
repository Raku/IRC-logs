[05:48] <brrt> good hi #moarvm

[05:49] <samcv> good hi :)

[06:05] *** brrt joined
[06:24] <brrt> i

[06:25] <brrt> 'm writing a new s-expression parser

[06:27] <samcv> cool

[08:01] <nine> brrt: why a new one?

[08:12] <brrt> the old one does funky things and these things cause it to do confusing things, basically

[08:13] <brrt> the expression templates are the primary extension points and it needs to Just Work

[08:13] <brrt> (for instance: if you end a line with a ')' too many, it will just stop reading full stop, and not tell you about it)

[08:14] <brrt> also, i want to support basic strings

[08:14] <brrt> 'basic' meaning, here, 'no, we don't support escapes'

[08:22] *** domidumont joined
[08:23] <brrt> escapes is what makes parsing strings hard, after all

[08:26] <geekosaur> ...until it turns out you need one

[08:28] <brrt> https://gist.github.com/bdw/ea18e04d86d38b3484387143985d5b41 the parser in question

[08:28] <brrt> meh, i'd be hard pressed to see the use case

[08:57] *** robertle joined
[09:35] <nine> brrt: I've heard that Perl 6 is good for writing parsers ;)

[09:40] <brrt> oh, sure. i've also heard that MoarVM is usually compiled before perl6 is present :-P

[09:40] <brrt> but yeah, that would've been  nicer

[09:46] <brrt> although, if i say so myself, the regex-tokenizer  kind of cute

[09:48] <nine> It is indeed

[09:50] <nine> But you did actually answer my question about whether the parser is a developer tool or part of the compilation process

[09:50] <brrt> i did not see that question i think

[09:51] <nine> Well I didn't ask it out loud ;)

[09:51] <brrt> oh, i didn't parse that sentence correctly :-)
