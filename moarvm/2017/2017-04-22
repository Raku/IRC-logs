[02:19] <samcv> samcv-- ;)

[02:19] <samcv> pretty sure i fixed the bug though. for indexic

[02:20] <samcv> really suprised that testing didn't catch it, but it only shows up in certain cases in perl6

[02:20] <samcv> but it's pretty bad of a bug

[02:20] <samcv> m: say "aaaaaaaabcd" ~~ m:i/abcd111111/;

[09:06] <timotimo> samcv: i threw out the 9999 tag

[09:07] <samcv> telemetry is failing on win

[09:07] <samcv> trying to use ifdefs so it doesn't compile on windows

[09:07] <samcv> appveyor building now

[09:10] <timotimo> oh, thanks

[09:10] <samcv> ack

[09:10] <samcv> still not

[09:11] <samcv> maybe it's trying to include the .h from the makefile? idk

[09:11] <samcv> i #if !defined(_WIN_32)

[09:11] <timotimo> how do we do thread stuff in other parts of moarvm? all with libuv, i guess?

[09:11] <samcv> in moar.h where the .h file is included

[09:11] <samcv> yes

[09:11] <timotimo> don't you mean __WIN32__?

[09:11] <timotimo> or ... __WIN_32__?

[09:11] <samcv> MABYE

[09:11] <samcv> ___________WIN32_________

[09:12] <samcv> idk i use #if defined(_WIN32) in memmem.h

[09:12] <samcv> and it works

[09:12] <timotimo> fwiw i put the "please do not use these" tag in so that the release page on moarvm's github has an indication that you shouldn't use it

[09:12] <timotimo> i used to delete all the releases manually

[09:12] <timotimo> but every single release popped up when a new one was made

[09:12] <samcv> maybe we should just revert it

[09:12] <samcv> so that we can bump NQP to get the string fix

[09:13] <samcv> more point releases! yay

[09:14] <timotimo> now the question becomes: do we bump versions of moar and nqp by just .01

[09:14] <samcv> but yeah see text here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/586 how it works now. nothing is changed with what the ops returned but internal loop returns different values now

[09:14] <samcv> ...

[09:14] <timotimo> or do we make it "catch up" to rakudo's point release version?

[09:14] <samcv> idk

[09:14] <samcv> i think we should bump it all together for less confusion

[09:14] <timotimo> yeah

[09:15] <samcv> but yeah we need a way for the indexic op to return not just position, but how many graphemes got expanded in the search

[09:15] <samcv> for equatic it's more simple because it only is boolean response

[09:16] <samcv> so the internal loop returns -1 for no match, and 0 or more for a positive match

[09:16] <samcv> 0 if no expanded characters and then more depending on how many haystack graphs expanded

[09:16] <samcv> but idk what api to use if we want rakudo and nqp to know about this info

[09:16] <samcv> cause

[09:17] <samcv> m: say "abﬆaa" ~~ m:i/st/

[09:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9ed89d: OUTPUT: «｢ﬆa｣␤»

[09:17] <timotimo> i'll change telemeh to use uv_thread_create

[09:17] <samcv> it has no clue about expand/unexponding chars

[09:17] <samcv> only knows the offset

[09:17] <samcv> idk can we bitshift it? and return a 64 bit value bitshifted :P

[09:17] <samcv> haha

[09:18] <samcv> or any other fancier things?

[09:18] <samcv> i mean we could retun an object not an integer but that seems like more work...

[09:18] <samcv> or array or whatever

[09:18] <samcv> thx timotimo

[09:20] <samcv> timotimo, uv handles arll the platform specific stuff for us. so super nice

[09:21] <samcv> abstraction ftw

[09:22] <timotimo> yeah

[09:22] <timotimo> it looks like uv_thread and friends are basically just pthreads

[09:52] <samcv> many issues

[09:52] <samcv> yep

[09:52] <samcv> why do you even need it?

[09:52] <timotimo> seems like sleep uses it

[09:52] <timotimo> i bet uv has a sleep function, too

[09:52] <samcv> yes

[09:53] <timotimo> it does not

[09:53] <timotimo> the examples just use sleep(1)

[09:55] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/luoyetx/6b86f8b2732eca09177f - that seems easy enough?

[09:55] <samcv> did you include libuv

[09:55] <timotimo> yeah

[09:56] <timotimo> otherwise how would the uv_ functions or the structs work?

[09:56] <samcv> we don't use sleep anywhere

[09:56] <samcv> except telemeh

[09:57] <samcv> they have timers

[09:58] <samcv> timotimo, uv_sleep

[09:58] <samcv> or maybe uh

[09:59] <samcv> there is uv_sleep

[09:59] <samcv> try that

[09:59] <samcv> void uv_sleep(int msec);

[10:00] <timotimo> why didn't i find it in the docs? >_<

[10:00] <samcv> it doesn't exist

[10:00] <samcv> well it does in the tests

[10:00] <timotimo> m)

[10:00] <samcv> in libuv/test

[10:20] <timotimo> in fact

[10:20] <timotimo> stdio.h is already included there

[10:20] <timotimo> and it gave the error

[10:21] <timotimo> oh wtf it's still complaining about snprintf

[10:23] <samcv> about _snprintf?

[10:23] <samcv> yeah

[10:24] <timotimo> no, it's complaining about snprintf

[10:24] <timotimo> i #define snprintf _snprintf but it's complaining that snprintf can't be found by the *linker*

[10:25] <timotimo> uh, telemeh.c doesn't even use snprintf anywhere

[10:25] <timotimo> what gives

[10:25] <timotimo> it only uses fprintf

[10:28] <timotimo> oh crap, geth dieded

[10:30] <samcv> uhm

[10:30] <samcv> see

[10:30] <timotimo> it seems like it could be the snprintf was put in by unrelated commits in a different part of moarvm

[10:34] <timotimo> because the linker sure as hell won't tell me which object file is trying to pull that in

[10:34] <samcv> uhm

[10:34] <timotimo> oh main.c could be

[10:34] <samcv> we have in src/core/coerce.c

[10:34] <samcv> #define snprintf _snprintf

[10:35] <samcv> dunno tho

[10:35] <timotimo> we have it in all manner of files

[10:35] <samcv> oh moar.c has

[10:35] <timotimo> but not in all files where it's used

[10:35] <samcv> the same def

[10:35] <timotimo> main.c doesn't

[10:35] <samcv> yes it does

[10:35] <timotimo> bytecodedump.c doesn't, either

[10:35] <samcv> err moar.c i mean

[10:36] <samcv> bytecodedump has vsnprintf

[10:36] <samcv> not sprintf

[10:36] <timotimo> ah, indeed

[10:36] <samcv> maybe we should try using libuv's snprintf instead of the define's?

[10:36] <timotimo> but src/core/exceptions.c defines vsnprintf _vsnprintf

[10:36] <samcv> yes i see

[10:37] <timotimo> but why? another file uses vsnprintf without the define and the linker isn't complaining about that

[10:37] <samcv> idk

[10:37] <Zoffix> mst: Seesm they did ignore it indeed. Thanks for trying to fix the travis stuff.

[10:37] <samcv> so it doesn't complain

[10:37] <samcv> timotimo, just copy and paste it in somewhere

[10:37] <samcv> idk. moar.h or something silly

[10:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port: 2c03c435e1 | (Timo Paulssen)++ | src/main.c

[10:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port: define some more snprintfs

[10:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port:

[10:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port: if all of this works, we'll try getting libuv's snprintf-for-windows.

[10:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2c03c435e1

[10:37] <samcv> the stuff in snprintf.c

[10:38] <timotimo> tell me, am i incompetent, or is this actually an unreasonable amount of shit msvc is putting us through ...?

[10:38] <samcv> uhm it is unreasonable but

[10:38] <samcv> i would steal their function since it should work everywhere

[10:39] <timotimo> why steal it? we should get it from uv with includes somehow …

[10:39] <samcv> well not if you don't include uv-common.h explicitly? dunno

[10:39] <samcv> #if !defined(snprintf) && defined(_MSC_VER) && _MSC_VER < 1900

[10:39] <samcv> extern int snprintf(char*, size_t, const char*, ...);

[10:39] <samcv> #endif

[10:39] <samcv> so idk

[10:39] <timotimo> yeah

[10:39] <samcv> i would just take try it

[10:40] <timotimo> are you watching my appveyor?

[10:40] <samcv> no

[10:40] <timotimo> i'll go look if the sauna's ready and if so, i'll spend some time in it; afterwards i'll try to figure out why the MVM_telemetry functions are magically disappearing

[10:40] <samcv> watching now

[10:41] <samcv> generating code

[10:41] <samcv> maybe it worked? hasn't failed yet. still maybe linking

[10:41] <timotimo> generating code takes ages

[10:41] <timotimo> that's the step before it complains with linker stuff

[10:42] <timotimo> cool, snprintf works now

[10:42] <timotimo> it was really the other files, not telemetry

[10:42] <timotimo> but telemetry also gives us trouble

[10:42] <samcv> failed

[10:42] <samcv> no snprintf errors tho

[10:42] <timotimo> yup

[10:42] <samcv> timotimo, include telemetry.h or whatever it's called in all of the files that use telemetry things

[10:43] <timotimo> it would be very strange if that was the problem

[10:43] <samcv> it's not always enough to put in moar.h

[10:43] <samcv> not a perfect world

[10:43] <samcv> where mscv doesn't suck

[10:43] <timotimo> everything that includes moar.h also has telemeh.h included

[10:44] <timotimo> BBIAB/BBL

[10:44] <samcv> one would hope so. but the linker is having issues

[10:44] <samcv> i will try that i guess

[10:44] <timotimo> i do see telemeh.c in the compiler output

[10:45] <timotimo> and if it weren't in the commandline of the linker in the makefile, it wouldn't possibly work on linux either

[10:45] <timotimo> but it definitely does work there

[10:49] <samcv> will be back in a bit

[11:13] <timotimo> it still got that error, huh

[11:15] <timotimo> can we perhaps get appveyor to cat the Makefile it generated?

[11:15] <timotimo> well, we can just put that in there for everything and just run it on appveyor

[11:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/telemeh_windows_port: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6140253446

[11:41] <timotimo> it's tough to figure stuff like this out if you're developing on linux, because (if i remember correctly) there MVM_PUBLIC is just the empty string

[11:42] <timotimo> 21:#define MVM_DLL_IMPORT __attribute__ ((visibility ("default")))

[11:42] <timotimo> 22:#define MVM_DLL_EXPORT __attribute__ ((visibility ("default")))

[11:42] <timotimo> 23:#define MVM_DLL_LOCAL  __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))

[11:42] <timotimo> this is what MVM_PUBLIC is

[11:43] <timotimo> if i had started with a mvm file already, i'd've immediately noticed i'd have to put MVM_PUBLIC, but since i was adapting code from a friend, i started with nothing mvm-related m)

[20:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f0db8822f5

[21:07] <samcv> timotimo, you think anyone will be against naming h_graphs to H_graphs because h's kind of look like n's

[21:07] <samcv> and we use n_graphs for needles.

[21:09] <samcv> h_g and n_g look pretty similar. so i may change them. it'd make me happy

[21:11] <samcv> probably a good idea if it can lead to less mistakes and clearer code

[21:15] <timotimo> maybe s_graphs vs n_graphs?

[21:15] <timotimo> for "stack"?

[21:15] <samcv> :S

[21:15] <samcv> i just replaced all h with H

[21:15] <samcv> and it really is nice to look at

[21:15] <samcv> way easier to visually parse

[21:16] <timotimo> yeah, i don't think it'd be a problem

[21:17] <timotimo> i should probably rename local variables and parameters in telemeh to use foo_bar instead of fooBar

[21:18] <samcv> https://github.com/samcv/MoarVM/blob/Haystack/src/strings/ops.c#L203-L220 see this

[21:18] <samcv> way nicer i think

[21:20] <samcv> i moved my backup'd folder back to original location while it was still open

[21:21] <samcv> since it wrote to it before it quit

[21:21] <timotimo> whoops

[21:21] <timotimo> that's bad :(

[21:22] <samcv> i have a backup from a while ago, may be good enough. cause i had perl 5 and C templates

[23:57] <TimToady> though it might scan the word for space to disallow it, don't remember

[23:59] <TimToady> ::() could only be used to describe a type that is in a compile-time value, otherwise would be a run-time thing
