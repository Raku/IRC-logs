[07:20] <brrt> good * nwc10

[07:20] <brrt> have you also seen the blowup of CORE.setting recently?

[07:23] <nwc10> blowup in what sense? It still works (builds) for me, but I didn't notice if it needs more time or more RAM

[07:46] *** brrt joined
[07:56] <brrt> as in, ASAN crashes

[08:04] <nwc10> ASAN on "my" machine doesn't crash on it

[08:08] <brrt> hmmm

[08:08] <brrt> what architecture is that

[08:16] * nwc10 goes to replace "emperor's new cup of coffee" with something a bit less vapourware

[14:58] <lizmat> S01-perl-5-integration/basic.t is reliably segfaulting for me now

[15:07] <brrt> yay

[15:07] <brrt> have you tried to point jit-bisect —spesh at that

[15:07] <brrt> or just jit-bisect.pl (for the expr jit)

[15:08] <lizmat> MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1  is the env var, right ?

[15:09] <lizmat> to switch off expr jit ?

[15:09] <brrt> yeah

[15:09] <brrt> but jit-bisect.pl will do that automatically for you

[15:10] <lizmat> it also segfaults with MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1 , but not as often

[15:11] <lizmat> could it be that it doesn't make a difference between MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1 and MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=0 ?

[15:18] <brrt> yes :-D

[15:18] <brrt> oh, you mean, running jit-bisect.pl

[15:18] <brrt> yeah, that will clear out any such flags prior to running
