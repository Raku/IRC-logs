[00:00] <timotimo> i had suspected it in line_coverage.c

[00:00] <timotimo> wonder if the output files would get trashed by multiple threads running code simultaneously

[00:03] <timotimo> i could actually re-use telemetry for this and make coverage logging and telemetry mutually exclusive

[00:04] <MasterDuke> seems reasonable

[00:05] <timotimo> the data delivery mechanism of telemeh only permits a little bit of data for every "packet"

[00:07] <MasterDuke> enough for filepath + linenum?

[00:11] <timotimo> nope

[00:12] <timotimo> the biggest is long long + int + const char *

[00:12] <timotimo> and also the thread id

[00:13] <MasterDuke> hm, create some sort of hash of filepaths and just pass keys/indexes?

[00:13] <timotimo> hmm, are the strings in the annotation perhaps null terminated ...

[00:14] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit

[00:27] <timotimo> hm, if i serialize instrumentation barriers so that i am guaranteed exclusive access to a datastructure to register loc info IDs ...

[00:49] <timotimo> ooh, /me learns about the quota boost

[01:01] <jnthn> sleep &

[01:04] <MasterDuke> i feel like there's some joke to be made about upgrading my Perl 6 interpreter with nitrous

[01:11] <MasterDuke> timotimo: fyi, `perl6 -e 'my $a; for ^100_000 { $a = $_.comb.sort.unique }; say $a'` took 4s normally, 8s with MVM_COVERAGE_LOG=c0.log and MVM_COVERAGE_CONTROL=2

[01:13] <MasterDuke> interestingly, when i misspelled .unique as .uniq, with those env variables set i got `MoarVM oops: Spesh: failed to fix up inline 1` instead of `No such method 'uniq' for invocant of type 'Seq'. Did you mean 'unique'?   in block <unit> at -e line 1`

[11:46] <dogbert11> just tried to build the 'even-moar-jit' branch but the configuration step failed with:

[11:46] <dogbert11> Generating src/gen/config.h ............................ FAIL

[11:46] <dogbert11> unknown configuration key 'jit_arch'

[11:47] <dogbert11> what could be the reson for this?

[11:47] <dogbert11> is it because I'm on 32-bit?

[11:59] *** Ven joined
[11:59] <MasterDuke> dogbert11: hm, maybe Configure.pl around line 403 needs another branch in that if statement

[12:31] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: I was tricked, it did complain with the message 'JIT isn't supported on platforms with 4 byte pointers.'. However this message is hidden in the config output which leads me to wonder why the config process isn't stopped at that point.

[12:32] <MasterDuke> yeah, that's odd

[12:33] <dogbert11> it just prints the message and continues only to fail completely a short time later with the 'jit_arch' message

[12:35] <MasterDuke> hm, so we lose 32bit support completely with that branch? or is there a way to tell it to not build the jit?

[12:36] <dogbert11> I don't believe that the jit has ever worked on 32 bit for some unspecified reason

[12:37] <jnthn> I suspect the configure problem is just an accident rather than anything deep

[12:37] <MasterDuke> yeah, but you can build the current moar without it

[12:37] <jnthn> From the error, it seems like it's trying to find a jit-related bit of configuration and include it in a non-JIT build

[12:37] *** http_GK1wmSU joined
[12:38] <jnthn> dogbert11: Reason is that x64 machine code and x86 machine code are quite different things to produce. :)

[12:39] <dogbert11> ah, simple as that :)

[12:39] <jnthn> And so producing the x86 code as well is a substantial amount of work, though the expr JIT will make it possible to do so with less effort

[12:40] <MasterDuke> fyi, on a semi-related note, i just built the even-moar-jit branch, built nqp, passed nqp's tests, built rakudo, and then passed its test and spectest

[12:41] <MasterDuke> my spectest time was roughly in line with before, but i don't have exact numbers to compare

[12:42] <dogbert11> jnthn++ new blog post

[12:43] <dogbert11> could it be said that Perl6 have three different optimizers, i.e. the jit, spesh and the --optimize switch in the perl6 executable?

[12:51] <timotimo> hm, i suppose so

[12:51] <timotimo> though the current jit doesn't optimize much

[12:51] <timotimo> the new jit is an optimizer compared to the current jit :P

[12:51] <timotimo> but will get more stuff as time passes

[12:52] <dogbert11> very cool, I guess I'll have to switch to a 64 bit vm sooner or later

[12:52] <timotimo> but yeah, the --optimize flag in the perl6 executable is completely distinct

[12:52] <timotimo> i'd recommend that :)

[12:52] <dogbert11> how does that work, i.e. what kind of optimizations does it do?

[12:53] <timotimo> it's written in nqp and operates on the QAST representation of the code

[12:53] <timotimo> you can get a look at what it does by comparing --target=ast and --target=optimize

[12:54] <dogbert11> so that optimizer works on a higher language level than both spesh and the jit?

[12:54] <timotimo> i'd say the most important thing it does is turn lexical variables into local variables because only blocks without lexical variables can be directly inlined into their lexical outers

[12:54] <timotimo> that's right, but it also doesn't have any run-time information

[12:55] <dogbert11> so it does its job at program startup/parsing?

[12:55] <timotimo> during compilation, yes, including precompilation of modules

[12:56] <dogbert11> interesting indeed

[12:57] <timotimo> another thing is that the MAST generated from the QAST is sometimes quite ugly

[12:57] <timotimo> spesh can help there, too

[12:58] <timotimo> like an abundance of decont and hllize instructions that don't actually do anything in 99.9% of code execution

[12:58] <dogbert11> hmm, slightly confusing terminology though, ASA, QAST, MAST and CFG's in SSA form

[12:59] <dogbert11> ASA -> AST

[13:10] <timotimo> well, QAST is just "what comes after PAST" and PAST was Parrot AST

[13:10] *** lizmat joined
[13:11] <timotimo> MAST is a moarvm-specific format that's no longer tree-shaped and very close to moarvm bytecode

[13:23] <dogbert11> thx for the explanation timotimo

[13:25] <timotimo> no prob

[13:26] <timotimo> i was going to point you at the mastcompiler c file in moarvm and say "that's why this file is so tiny and simple"

[13:26] <timotimo> but it's still pretty big :P

[13:27] *** AlexDaniel joined
[14:03] <timotimo> moar is doing something strange

[14:03] <timotimo> opening /proc/self/stat multiple times per second

[14:06] <timotimo> checking if it should do a full gc, huh

[14:07] <timotimo> can't be too slow i suppose; it doesn't show up notably in the perf output

[15:12] *** zakharyas joined
[15:42] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: hey, so what's the current status of the leak?

[15:45] *** pharv joined
[15:46] <timotimo> hm, so, heaptrack, right? can we get it to show more than just the caller of the allocator function itself?

[16:08] *** Ven joined
[16:51] <MasterDuke> timotimo: would the flame graph be more useful? http://i.imgur.com/dJXfLVF.png

[16:52] <timotimo> yeah that looks interesting

[16:52] <timotimo> does "allocations" mean "how often was any allocator function called"?

[16:53] <timotimo> is there one that tallies up the size?

[16:53] <MasterDuke> http://i.imgur.com/MobPJRy.png

[16:53] <timotimo> ah dang

[16:54] <MasterDuke> ?

[16:54] <timotimo> whatever function ends up triggering the gc will get the nursery re-allocation counted towards it

[16:54] *** Ven_ joined
[16:55] <timotimo> that won't do at all

[16:55] <timotimo> however, we do see that the "little" buffers we allocate for libuv to fill make up a big chunk of what we allocate in total

[16:56] <MasterDuke> http://i.imgur.com/J20JZv5.png by peak allocation

[16:56] <MasterDuke> do you have heaptrack installed?

[16:58] <timotimo> i do

[16:58] <timotimo> i think?

[16:58] <timotimo> hm, okay, the peak of stuff allocated there isn't terribly bad

[16:59] <MasterDuke> i could put my heaptrack recording on the whateverable server if you want to play around with viewing it locally

[17:03] <timotimo> interesting

[17:03] <timotimo> hm but now

[17:03] <timotimo> this is leaking, right?

[17:03] <timotimo> i.e. increasing its memory

[17:04] <MasterDuke> yeah

[17:04] <timotimo> does any part of the flame graph get noticably bigger or does it all just sort of grow together?

[17:04] <MasterDuke> http://i.imgur.com/CnqmYw8.png

[17:08] <MasterDuke> timotimo: don't quite understand the question

[17:16] <timotimo> like do all parts grow equally when you increase the number of iterations?

[17:29] *** Voldenet joined
[17:35] <timotimo> can you hide individual slices from that mountain graph?

[17:36] <timotimo> everything above the orange is really difficult to make out because it just goes up and down so much

[17:43] <MasterDuke> you can zoom in and hover over the sections and it'll tell you the function they're for. hard to show that in a screenshot though

[17:43] <timotimo> right

[17:43] <timotimo> might have to actually use the heap snapshot profile for this task

[17:44] <MasterDuke> but it was causing immediate segvs

[17:45] <timotimo> wow, damn

[17:45] <MasterDuke> fyi, i just put the heaptrack recording on the whateverable server

[17:45] <MasterDuke> if you want it

[17:46] <timotimo> interesting, it segfaults inside spesh

[17:46] <timotimo> without spesh the heap profiler can run

[17:46] <jnthn> Huh, that's a bit odd...

[17:47] <timotimo> when gc-ing sim frames

[17:47] <MasterDuke> maybe related, but did you notice my comments from late last night ?

[17:47] <MasterDuke> interestingly, when i misspelled .unique as .uniq, with those env variables set i got `MoarVM oops: Spesh: failed to fix up inline 1` instead of `No such method 'uniq' for invocant of type 'Seq'. Did you mean 'unique'?   in block <unit> at -e line 1`

[17:47] <timotimo> i only looked at it a microscopical bit

[17:47] <timotimo> so don't know what actually is broken here

[17:47] <jnthn> The spesh worker thread runs just as a normal thread, so...

[17:47] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Can you file that as a MoarVM issue? I'd like to look at that during the week.

[17:48] <MasterDuke> jnthn: the heap profiler thing? or the "failed to fix up inline"?

[17:49] <jnthn> MasterDuke: The inline one

[17:49] <MasterDuke> k

[17:49] <jnthn> I changed a bunch of inline-related things last week so we can actually deleted dead inlines.

[17:49] <jnthn> *delete

[17:49] <jnthn> It should mark what it removes

[17:49] <jnthn> And then not try to fix them up

[17:50] <jnthn> And I remembering writing the code to make it handle nested inlines

[17:50] <jnthn> So not sure what'd be going on. Will look in the next days.

[17:52] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/629

[17:52] <jnthn> Thanks!

[17:53] * jnthn figures he should try and rest some ahead of throwing himself into another week of MoarVM hackery :)

[17:54] <MasterDuke> also, jnthn++ for spesh blog post. very understandable

[17:59] <jnthn> Glad it made some sense; always have to be careful writing such things after having been dug into the problem space for weeks :)

[18:07] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: I believe I misunderstood your memory problems yesterday, the problem is not memory leaks but rather memory usage. Is that correct?

[18:08] *** lizmat joined
[18:09] <MasterDuke> i'd say both

[18:10] <dogbert11> running your gist from yesterday (with four iterations rather than 20), leaks are negligible but allocated memory is soething else ...

[18:11] <dogbert11> MoarVM version 2017.07-333-g8752f9b0: total heap usage: 748,062 allocs, 433,024 frees, 1,337,211,640 bytes allocated

[18:12] <dogbert11> MoarVM version 2017.07: total heap usage: 643,447 allocs, 374,708 frees, 417,122,198 bytes allocated

[18:12] <MasterDuke> yeah, i think there's some of both, but the large allocations is more noticeable

[18:14] <MasterDuke> hm, wonder if i should do some manual bisecting with valgrind on the whateverable server

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> bisecting bisectable again? :)

[18:25] <MasterDuke> turtles all the way down!

[18:28] <dogbert11> hmm, the gisted code breaks --profile

[18:30] * dogbert11 tries another program

[18:30] <japhb> .oO( "Bisecting the bisectables but they don't know / Debugging the buggables but in the end you know / You turn away, what can I say?" )

[18:31] <MasterDuke> dogbert11: yeah, pretty much anything with run/Proc::Async/etc breaks profiling

[19:53] <dogbert11> sounds promising

[20:48] <timotimo> but that should only cause churn, i.e. things being malloced and soon freed again

[20:51] <MasterDuke> well this is just based on valgrind's "total heap usage" line

[20:51] <MasterDuke> the last "allocated" number

[20:51] <MasterDuke> before that commit it's ~300,00,00, after it's ~2,000,000,000

[20:52] <timotimo> that's "total allocated" but not "in use at end" right?

[20:53] <MasterDuke> right, that's number is pretty much the same

[20:53] <timotimo> yeah, so it's just useless information :)

[20:55] <MasterDuke> hm. what would be more useful?

[20:55] <timotimo> hm

[20:55] <timotimo> figuring out what kind of object there is more of after each iteration

[20:56] <timotimo> but if you want you can probably revert that commit to get a less inflated number there

[20:56] <MasterDuke> think it'll revert cleanly?

[20:59] <MasterDuke> how would i get a count of objects if i can't use the heap profiler?

[21:01] <timotimo> does it also crash if you turn spesh off?

[21:03] <MasterDuke> not immediately...

[21:08] <MasterDuke> ah, got a snapshot with spesh disabled

[21:09] <MasterDuke> let see, guess i should get one at 2017.07 to compare

[21:13] <MasterDuke> ugh, 2017.07 gave `MoarVM panic: Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 72085436 bytes`

[21:30] <MasterDuke> but now i have a heap profile, with 43 snapshots

[21:30] <MasterDuke> which one(s) should i look at?

[21:36] <timotimo> oof

[21:37] <timotimo> we don't really have a way to cross-reference what happens in the program with the heap snapshots, except for looking really closely

[21:37] <timotimo> one of the reasons i'd like to offer an op that lets you put a piece of data into telemeh

[21:40] <MasterDuke> would one at random in the middle be somewhat representative?

[21:40] <timotimo> i suppose, but i'd rather go near the end

[21:41] <MasterDuke> hm, 43 snapshots at 2017.07, only 34 at head

[21:42] <timotimo> mhm

[21:42] <timotimo> i forgot what exactly it was that jnthn did to often cause us fewer gc runs

[21:42] <MasterDuke> compare 3/4ths of the way through of each?

[21:42] <timotimo> mhm

[21:42] <MasterDuke> say #35 and #28?

[21:43] <MasterDuke> ugh, and don't have to ram to open both at once...

[21:44] <timotimo> oops :(

[21:44] <timotimo> on my laptop i have as much zram as i have actual ram

[21:44] <timotimo> ever since i destroyed the slotted-in ram (or whatever else) i'm suffering under low ram all the time

[21:44] <MasterDuke> i don't have a swap be default

[21:44] <timotimo> oh

[21:44] <timotimo> i have 2x zram compared to normal ram

[21:44] <timotimo> it's actually already as full as the ram totally (i.e. including the compressed parts)

[21:46] <MasterDuke> top objects by size? anything else useful?

[21:49] * MasterDuke doesn't have enough ram to have two heap analyzers open on any one computer, but just realized he's using two computers...

[21:53] <timotimo> maybe also top objects by count and top stables by size and count

[23:24] <MasterDuke> jnthn: does any of the the above point anything out to you? something else timotimo and/or i should try?

[23:24] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Not really; I'll see if I can figure it out a bit more tomorrow though.

[23:24] <jnthn> Heading to sleep shortly

[23:26] <MasterDuke> cool, later...

[23:31] <timotimo> i feel like sleep, too

[23:31] <timotimo> have you tried the realloc trick for the bufs that we allocate for libuv btw?

[23:34] <MasterDuke> no, didn't figure out what exactly was getting realloced to what value

[23:34] <MasterDuke> but can try if you can give some more detailed instructions

[23:36] <timotimo> oh, sure

[23:36] <timotimo> what file was that in again ...

[23:36] <MasterDuke> procops.c, somewhere around line 531 i believe

[23:38] <timotimo> right, so buf->base is the pointer that's eligible for reallocing, buf->len is the actual size that it was last allocated with, and nread is how much is actually used inside the buffer

[23:38] <timotimo> since we don't expect the buffer to be changed afterwards, we can probably just realloc it to the exact number of items read

[23:38] <MasterDuke> jnthn had some comment about how buf->len is supposed to be correct (or something like that)

[23:39] <timotimo> if we decide to, for example, round up to the next number aligned to, like, 32 bytes, or whatever, we'd have a different ssize vs elems

[23:40] <MasterDuke> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2017-08-05#i_14973403

[23:41] <MasterDuke> so i shouldn't just change what res_buf->body.ssize gets assigned, i need to do a realloc?

[23:42] <timotimo> ssize will hold what you realloc to, which may be different from the number of elements used

[23:43] <MasterDuke> so realloc, then set ssize to whatever value i used for the realloc?

[23:44] <MasterDuke> btw, i assume the new value should be nread*(sizeof an element), but what is that size?

[23:47] <MasterDuke> oh, tc->instance->str_consts.buf_type perhaps?

[23:47] <timotimo> no, that's all just strings

[23:48] <timotimo> we use 8 bits for all of these

[23:49] <timotimo> that's also why the .i8 slot is selected for assignment

[23:49] <timotimo> (even though it makes no difference)

[23:49] <timotimo> (all platforms we develop for have the same size of pointer for all kinds of things pointed at)

[23:49] <MasterDuke> ah, so just nread*1 ?

[23:52] <timotimo> i believe so

[23:55] <MasterDuke> `error: assignment of member ‘base’ in read-only object`

[23:59] <MasterDuke> 1519408maxresident)k before, 1303076maxresident)k after

[23:59] <timotimo> um, huh?

[23:59] <MasterDuke> res_buf->body.slots.i8 = MVM_realloc(buf->base, nread); res_buf->body.ssize    = nread;

[23:59] <timotimo> oh, huh
