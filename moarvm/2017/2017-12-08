[04:38] <samcv> yeah it's not really a problem. i will fix it soonish but it's not doing anythig other than warning

[04:38] <yoleaux> 6 Dec 2017 12:03Z <tbrowder> samcv: i made yr suggested chgs

[04:38] <yoleaux> 7 Dec 2017 10:07Z <tbrowder> samcv: Thank you Sam I am!

[04:39] <samcv> ugh ucd2c.pl is frustrating me. i thought i'd be able to have apply_to_range create new codepoints that were not added by UnicodeData.txt, but for some reason most i add that way will break tons of codepoints

[04:39] <samcv> though there are certain ones i can add and everything is fine and dandy. though i've only tried a couple and they were both adjacent to other codepoints

[04:40] <samcv> at least i've gotten much closer to that, by having it add ->{next_point} and add things to $planes at the end of adding data on codepoints. before it was error prone and was only done in UnicodeData()

[04:41] <samcv> so you couldn't add any codepoints that were not in UnicodeData.txt

[04:54] <samcv> my goal is so that points are added the same way no matter which sub is adding them and UnicodeData doesn't do anything different. wish i could figure out why i can't add ceratain codepoints without breaking it though
