[10:58] <lizmat> .ask jnthn would it make sense to also auto-generate BUILD_LEAST_DERIVED ?

[10:58] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[14:48] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/5ef30f0a2c60ec7df97edaf52d43bbc9 - monstrous heap snapshot from the heap snapshot analyzer analyzing a single snapshot inside another heap snapshot

[14:52] <timotimo> something may still be wrong; path tells me that an IntPosRef is a Heap Snapshot Entry from a comp unit

[14:59] <timotimo> i might need a 32gig ram workstation to effectively work on the heap analyzer :D

[15:17] *** rba joined
[15:21] <timotimo> i hoped to get the memory use down considerably by using a channel to move data over from the parsing part to the analyzing part for the collectables

[15:22] <timotimo> because i was assuming it'd be bad to have around two million 64bit integer lists with 6 entries each around before starting to go through that data

[22:30] <MasterDuke> timotimo: ooo, was your grant proposal accepted?

[22:34] <timotimo> it was!

[22:34] <timotimo> i linked to the post in #perl6

[22:34] <MasterDuke> timotimo++ very cool

[22:36] <timotimo> my wrists need to recover double-time

[22:37] <MasterDuke> got any good voice-to-text software?

[22:40] <timotimo> i own a copy of dragon 12

[22:40] <timotimo> it's windows only :\

[22:40] <timotimo> i do have a vm now, though

[22:41] <MasterDuke> wine is pretty good these days

[22:42] <timotimo> it wasn't good enough to install the program two years ago or so

[22:43] <MasterDuke> https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=2077

[22:43] <timotimo> i *think* i have 12.5

[22:43] <MasterDuke> looks very dependent on the version

[22:44] <timotimo> yeah, not only which version of the program, but also which version of wine
