[12:04] <jnthn> .tell piojo Such types should be interned even across compilation units. This process is largely implemented in src/6model/parametric.c. The interning should also be happening at deserialization time; see https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L3003 for a place to start digging further

[12:04] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to piojo.
