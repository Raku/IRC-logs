[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: [unicode-grant] Add string eqat/index ignorecase+ignoremark funct's

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: To add this function with a minimum extra code, we alter the

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: string_equal_at_ignore_case_INTERNAL_loop to take an extra argument:

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: 'ignoremark'. If set to 1 it will use the new ord_getbasechar function

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: to search ignoring unicode marks in addition to ignoring the case.

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: I factored code from MVM_string_ord_basechar_at into the new ord_getbasechar

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: function so we can reuse code between that and the INTERNAL_loop function.

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[00:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: I factored out similarly for MVM_string_equal_at_ignore_case and ignore_mark.

[09:00] <jnthn> Grrr, 2FA is great until for some reason the code isn't sent :/

[11:03] <brrt> anyway, i've been thinking and thinking and thinking

[11:03] <brrt> the tl;dr

[11:03] <brrt> the least complex way to go forward is to take out point spilling

[11:04] <brrt> it does not interact well with the retroactive action of the full spilling

[11:04] <brrt> which is interesting

[11:04] <brrt> because linear scan moves forward, so you can usually assume that your local decisions are not invalidateed

[11:04] <brrt> but spillling also works backwards

[11:07] <brrt> the other interesting bit is

[11:08] <brrt> i currently don't insert loads for ARGLIST refs

[11:08] <brrt> because arglist can have more refs than can possibly fit in regsiters

[11:08] <brrt> but obviously, that's not going to be an issue for retroactively-spilled arglist refs

[11:09] <brrt> since, well, they must have fit for the value to have been live at that point
