[00:32] <samcv> it actually seems to be making it bigger

[00:32] <samcv> well at least for the collation ones. maybe it's the fact that it is adding the enum arrays hm

[00:32] <samcv> since there are a lot of them

[00:38] <samcv> though it is giving me the chance to add the capability regardless. i may end up setting some back but that will be much easier than the work i've done. after i convert them to int properties and all is well i'll decide about the spacing issue

[00:39] <samcv> also i have been able to factor some of the code into separate functions, things that are repeated and such

[01:04] *** lizmat joined
[01:24] <samcv> jnthn: it's <:Digit> that's been broken forever right?

[01:24] <samcv> i was adding checks so that the pvalues will all start at 0, have no gaps, and have no two property values to the same pvalue

[01:24] <samcv> pvalue code that is

[01:25] <samcv> and looks like Digit is not ending

[01:25] <samcv> 'None' => 0, 'Numeric' => 1, 'Decimal' => 3

[09:12] <brrt> good samcv, too :-P

[10:02] <jnthn> samcv: Hmm, I thought it was :Space or something, but that might have been a different problem... :)

[10:02] <jnthn> morning o/

[10:04] <samcv> well space is fixed

[10:04] <samcv> but <:Digit> matches everything

[10:04] <samcv> m: 'a' ~~ /<:Digit>/

[10:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar d9021cf16: ( no output )

[10:05] <samcv> m: say 'a' ~~ /<:Digit>/

[10:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar d9021cf16: OUTPUT: «｢a｣␤»

[10:05] <samcv> it's special cased as a subtype of Numeric_Type but the code deletes it from the enum, and uhm registers it as a property or something weird

[10:14] <jnthn> o.O
