[10:39] <nwc10> well, we have snow

[10:39] <nwc10> no idea about braaaaaaaaaaaanes

[10:40] <jnthn> Darn, the snow missed here.

[10:40] <dogbert2> the snow where I'm at melted away

[10:48] <ilmari> it was down to freezing here overnight, but no snow, and it's up to 3°C now

[10:49] * jnthn works on a Cro middleware task as a warm-up :)

[11:13] <jnthn> Well, that went to plan :)

[11:17] <dogbert2> an easy fix then ?

[11:20] <jnthn> Was actually implementing a feature, for once, rather than fixing something ;)

[11:21] <dogbert2> cool

[11:29] <brrt> good *, btw

[11:30] <dogbert2> hello brrt

[11:30] <brrt> i note that i, for one, do not have any brane left

[11:30] <brrt> they were all out this morning

[11:30] <dogbert2> perhaps jnthn stole your brane :)

[11:31] <brrt> i blame the lack of snow

[11:32] <jnthn> Grr, this inlines/handlers thing is going to be quite tricky

[11:46] <jnthn> Really so. Just discovering the number of places that assume a flat table.

[11:49] <jnthn> And noting that each of them will get more complex.

[11:52] <jnthn> Think I'll see if I can find an alternate solution that's going to be less invasive, now I've seen the cost of my original idea

[13:16] <jnthn> om nom borsch

[13:16] <jnthn> So I think I have a far easier to implement alternative solution

[13:16] <nwc10> \o/

[13:16] <jnthn> We poke entries into the handlers extent list that mark the boundaries of an inline

[13:17] <jnthn> Thus the handler walker knows when it's crossing such a boundary

[13:18] <jnthn> That provides a way forward on the "skip the caller, then look for outer" issue

[13:19] <jnthn> If that extent list entry were to also contain an indication of which inline we just crossed the boundary of, then we can use that to do lookups to decide if this is or isn't a decent outer

[13:24] <jnthn> src/strings/unicode.c: In function ‘MVM_unicode_get_property_str’:

[13:24] <jnthn> src/strings/unicode.c:72236:83: warning: pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional expression ? Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph_enums[0] : Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph_enums[result_val]) : bogus;

[13:24] <jnthn> samcv: ^

[13:48] <brrt> jnthn, i'm not sure if i understood that correctly

[14:03] <jnthn> Which bit? :)

[14:03] <brrt> the entries-into-the-handlers-extent-list-that-mark-the-boundaries-of-an-inline

[14:04] <jnthn> Oh

[14:04] <jnthn> It's just putting extra rows into the handlers table

[14:04] <jnthn> So that when we walk it, we can understand that we are leaving a region of code that was inlined
