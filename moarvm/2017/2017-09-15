[10:58] <timo> i wonder what the prior art is concerning graphing the dependencies and orchestration of tasklets like our code-backed promises

[12:09] <MasterDuke> timo: to implement a single-block-of-memory ssize+slots in VMArray, i assume the MVMArrayBody struct loses the MVMuint ssize, but does the current definition of slots stay the same?

[12:10] <MasterDuke> and allocating it would be something like MVM_fixed_size_alloc(..., sizeof(MVMuint) + (sizeof(<type>) * num_of_slots))?

[12:15] <MasterDuke> or should MVMArrayBody instead get a new `struct { MVMuint64 ssize; union { ...} slots; } storage;` member?

[12:15] <timo> perhaps that'd be saner than calculating offsets in the code

[12:16] <timo> after all, structs are really just the compiler calculating offsets for us

[12:24] <MasterDuke> timo: thanks, i'll give it a shot

[12:24] <timo> good luck!
