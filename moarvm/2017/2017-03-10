[00:06] <japhb> Sadly, it appears the MoarVM fixes this week did *not* coincidentally fix my input lockup woes: This is Rakudo version 2017.02-224-g68a40f7d9 built on MoarVM version 2017.02-31-g91aab714

[00:07] <japhb> I'd hoped that my weird stuck input thread problem would be fixed by one of the stability fixes, but alas no.

[00:08] <japhb> Ah well, no avoiding work by playing Perl 6 games today.  ;-)

[00:23] <TimToady> when you say "input", do you mean a pipe that could wedge because the other end filled its stderr, like precompilation does when you put too much debugging out on stderr?

[14:25] * dogbert17_ shocking silence ...

[14:32] <dogbert17_> what's our take on making patches to 3rd party libs, do we have any? Is referring to MoarVM 549 aka RT #130713

[14:32] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130713

[15:05] <timotimo> it'd be nice if we could sanely handle patchsets

[15:08] <brrt> good *, timotimo, dogbert17_

[15:12] <dogbert17_> o/ brrt

[15:13] <dogbert17_> timotimo, you found a patch for that expmod problem

[15:14] <dogbert17_> problem seems to be that it has not been merged into libtommath :(

[15:16] <brrt> it's always possible to maintain your own fork, and, it's even pretty easy

[15:16] <brrt> and in general i prefer that above having patchsets

[15:18] <timotimo> that's the problem, yes

[15:18] <timotimo> ISTR this isn't the first time we had problems where we had to patch a 3rdparty thing

[15:19] <timotimo> also, there's some distros that are super vigilant about putting 3rdparty stuff or anything sharable really into distro-wide packages

[15:20] <[Coke]> timotimo: we kind of support letting people use their own copies of the 3rd party libs, so that could mean we have a rakudo out there with the same version # that is behaving differently. Not sure how much we want to worry about that.

[15:20] <[Coke]> (Maybe we just make a super verbose --version)

[15:20] <brrt> that's true;, but in fact, we often know better

[15:21] <dogbert17_> I see that some patches have been made earlier to the MoarVM copy of the lib in question

[15:21] <nine> It probably also depends on how obscure the bug is

[15:21] <nine> And how likely that upstream will include the patch soonish.

[15:21] <dogbert17_> https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/issues/67

[15:25] <timotimo> i say we merge that patch in our own fork.

[15:26] <timotimo> Latest commit b8527e9  on 10 Oct 2016

[15:26] <nine> Maybe we could get co-maintainership on that repo?

[15:26] <timotimo> libtommath is sufficiently slow moving

[15:26] <timotimo> at least they got the rand fix in

[16:05] <timotimo> You donâ€™t have permission to fork to these organizations:

[16:05] <timotimo> MoarVM

[16:06] <timotimo> https://github.com/libtom/libtommath - jnthn wanna push the "fork" button on this page and fork it into MoarVM/ ?

[16:06] <jnthn> Didn't we already have a fork of that? :)

[16:07] <jnthn> ah, no

[16:07] <timotimo> i looked, we didn't

[16:07] <jnthn> hah, you're right

[16:08] <jnthn> Forkee

[16:08] <jnthn> d

[16:08] <timotimo> can you give me lots of permissions for this?

[16:08] <timotimo> for example to edit the description

[16:09] <timotimo> may not even be necessary, actually *shrug*

[16:09] <jnthn> See if you ahve it now

[16:10] <timotimo> no "Edit" button for the description

[16:10] <timotimo> no "Settings" tab at the top either

[16:11] <jnthn> Now?

[16:11] <timotimo> that's it! :)

[16:12] <jnthn> yay

[16:12] <timotimo> um, wait ... our libtommath isn't actually a submodule?!

[16:12] <timotimo> indeed, we just pushed stuff in there ... 2 years ago

[16:13] <timotimo> "oops" :)

[16:16] * timotimo rebuilds and spectests and all that

[16:19] <japhb> TimToady: https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/raw-input/lib/Terminal/Print/RawInput.pm6 is the input code, https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/raw-input/examples/tris.p6 is the example code that uses it, and https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/issues/19#issuecomment-282329480 is the behavior.

[16:20] <timotimo> teh tris!

[16:21] <japhb> [Coke]: Perhaps `make test` for MoarVM should include tests for the things we've patched in our dependency libs, and if someone compiles with a non-blessed version that still has the bugs, we can complain loudly.  I'm guessing this would be visible to packagers, at least.  And with a good enough error message, we can tell them what patch(es) to cherry-pick.

[16:21] <japhb> timotimo: Yup!  :-)

[16:21] <timotimo> are you adhering to the official rules on how tetris must behave?

[16:23] <japhb> It's closing in on original tetris.  It doesn't have the special behaviors for e.g. flipping a T into place and getting extra points for a clear -- but then again, the input problem happens quickly enough that I haven't coded line clears yet, so there you go.  Right now it's literally the *original* tetris, that was just a test of fitting blocks together tightly, before he invented the line-clearing to make the game last longer.  :-)

[16:25] <timotimo> fair enough

[16:28] <japhb> It does have the feature that was most important to me when I was learning -- wall kick when rotating.  You don't get a piece stuck against the side (or a block tower) because you're rotating "the wrong way".

[16:29] <timotimo> right

[16:29] <timotimo> i see you know enough about tetris to do this stuff right

[16:29] <japhb> Heh

[17:35] <nwc10> I'm not sure about the reconfigure. "take off and nuke it from orbit" possible

[17:35] <nwc10> possibly

[17:35] <nwc10> Configure.pl gave me this:

[17:37] <timotimo> but i already git rm'd that folder

[17:37] <timotimo> how come it doesn't do this properly?

[17:37] <nwc10> I didn't look too hard, but I guess either

[17:37] <timotimo> maybe because there's some .o files?

[17:37] <timotimo> i wonder what happens if you "make realclean" first

[17:37] <nwc10> 1) I misremember just what I tried before deleting it

[17:37] <nwc10> or

[20:11] <samcv> jnthn, you look at my PR?

[20:13] <jnthn> D'oh, sorry, got zoned in to $other-job task earlier

[20:13] <jnthn> It was the first time this week that $other-job was being fun rather than a pain :P

[20:14] <jnthn> Hm, wonder why Travis is sad...

[20:15] <jnthn> samcv: https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/jobs/209636303#L471

[20:15] <jnthn> Looks like that's a legit compile error

[20:16] <samcv> will check that out. any other comments on it though?

[20:16] <jnthn> I did the bit that didn't need me to think first :-)

[20:16] <jnthn> Looking at the code now :)

[20:17] <jnthn> h_offset = 0; /* XXX I think this is the right behavior here */

[20:17] <jnthn> I thought we would throw on those

[20:18] <samcv> well that's what the other function does

[20:18] <jnthn> Oh, though maybe not

[20:18] <jnthn> Yeah, throw is regex-engine-nasty I guess

[20:18] <samcv> the case sensitive one

[20:18] <jnthn> *nod*

[20:18] <jnthn> Oh, though don't know how this'd come up in the regex engine

[20:18] <jnthn> Anyway, if it matches what the sensitive one does, thenfine

[20:24] <jnthn> samcv: Left comments, other than that looks good

[20:24] <jnthn> (And my comment is only pointing out why the Travis was upset)

[20:26] <samcv> it shows a weird commit number on travis

[20:27] <samcv> that's not the actual commit hash

[20:27] <samcv> odd

[20:27] <samcv> thx for showing me. the line numbers were off on the error message

[20:28] <samcv> and not sure if it was the correct commit either

[20:29] <jnthn> I'm used to spotting that kinda issue 'cus it upsets MSVC. :)

[20:30] <samcv> high quality enterpriseâ„¢ product

[20:30] <jnthn> "Nobody uses C any more, we'll focus on C++ only!"

[20:31] <samcv> it's amazing how well C has fared as languages go

[20:31] <jnthn> oops, that commit won't work?

[20:31] <jnthn> Because it uses h_g before assigning it?

[20:32] <samcv> sorry :P I just woke up like 20 mins ago

[20:32] <jnthn> :-)

[20:32] * jnthn felt like that all day

[20:33] <samcv> maybe should just allocate h_fc_cps once at the top and then not have to allocate it ever again

[20:38] <samcv> jnthn, i always thought it was weird you could initialize variables WITH code but couldn't have any other kind of code

[20:39] <samcv> or i guess it's only functions or something not 100% sure.

[20:39] <samcv> haven't had to use this C standard except on MVM

[20:52] <samcv> argh the build is still failing at the same spot

[20:52] <samcv> well. it's still giving the wrong line number.

[20:53] <samcv> oh nvm i think it's still showing the old status. will wait for travis to wake up

[21:08] <jnthn> samcv: Yeah, I find it annoying, but "don't build on MSVC" isn't really an option for us either

[21:08] <samcv> yep
