[05:59] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[05:59] <brrt> hope you all had a good easter

[06:07] <samcv> good * brrt

[06:08] <brrt> ohai samcv

[06:08] <samcv> hey

[06:08] <brrt> i enjoyed your blog post

[06:08] <samcv> cool

[06:10] <samcv> trying to get every single module built into an appimage now. finally it's actually installing them all.

[06:10] <samcv> maybe will take over an hour to install ALL modules though maybe?

[06:11] <samcv> i'm worried travis will time out cause it's at 21mins so far.

[06:12] <samcv> it says 50 mins is the time limit. we will see

[07:49] <nwc10> jnthn: I almost had a rather messy coffee bootstrapping problem. I raised the level to start the machine, and only then realised that I hadn't put a cup under it

[07:50] <nwc10> fortunately it takes about a second for the liquid to start to flow out, and there were cups warming on top, so got one under it before anything was spilled

[09:30] <jnthn> nwc10: uh-oh :)

[09:30] <jnthn> Good save, though :)

[09:30] <jnthn> Coffee bootstrapped fine here :)

[09:31] <jnthn> Though I do need to carefully consider the whole coffee matter

[09:31] <jnthn> Just got a new office, which doesn't yet have a coffee machine :)

[09:32] <jnthn> It doesn't yet have (good) internet access or hardware either, to be fair :)

[13:02] <[Coke]> I just went through a layoff-rehire in situ with a new company... Apparently we lost the one person who brews coffee in the morning as part of that deal (as I've now been doing it when I get it.)

[13:02] <yoleaux> 00:58Z <MasterDuke_> [Coke]: i think NQP_VERBOSE_EXCEPTIONS=1 is what gives better jvm errors

[13:02] <[Coke]> *in

[13:46] <moritz> [Coke]: that sucks, but could have been worse, from your perspective

[14:05] <[Coke]> Right, of all the things that could have gone wrong, having to brew a pot of coffee is pretty low on the list. (there are actually much more annoying things going on, but they're all fine in the end too)

[15:41] <brrt> that updates even-moar-jit to 2017.04

[16:34] <timotimo> i might have to rework mark_call_graph_node to use something worklist-like instead of recursing

[16:35] <timotimo> another place where a dynamic array would be needed. the worklist itself doesn't really work 100%

[16:35] <timotimo> because it has MVMCollectable***; call graph nodes aren't even collectable at all

[16:37] <timotimo> (and also there is no gen2 question there either)
