[06:22] <nwc10> jnthn: spectest6 eventually gave up with a non-ASAN failure after just over 24 hours of looping: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/540693

[06:22] <nwc10> so, I think that makes it a good moarning

[13:23] <jnthn> samcv: One comment but it's not very important...

[13:23] <samcv> yeah i noticed that. it was already there I think before I changed things

[13:24] <jnthn> Yeah, I noticed that too :)

[13:24] <samcv> yeah so. gonna just leave it for now I think. just in case

[13:24] <jnthn> Maybe I'll just merge it and clean up later? Or you want to do it now?

[13:24] <jnthn> OK

[13:24] <samcv> nah just leave it in now

[13:24] <jnthn> Also noticed we call the struct NamedAlias but elsewhere it's name alias

[13:25] <jnthn> Again, don't think I'm bothered enough about this to suggest we change it :)

[13:29] <Geth> MoarVM: There are only 5 codepoints which have changed their functionality

[15:55] <jnthn> That's pretty :)

[15:58] <timotimo> yup

[17:36] *** domidumont joined
[17:49] <nwc10> ASAN is very excited by generate_codepoints_by_name

[17:49] <nwc10> for example http://paste.scsys.co.uk/540698

[17:50] <nwc10> I hope that the causeis obvious to someone. If not, I'll bisect

[17:55] <timotimo> i'm glad we have you :)

[17:56] <lizmat> nwc10: pretty sure samcv will have a look at it when she's awake again :-)

[18:11] *** vendethiel- joined
[18:35] *** vendethiel joined
[19:50] *** vendethiel joined
[20:07] <timotimo> samcv: does the backtrace in nwc10's paste ring a bell to you?

[20:09] <nwc10> I did bisect it. It's commit 816186484b5cc52f9ff1be6afa3b6f49264335bf

[20:10] <nwc10> Remove Unicode 1 names and add Unicode Name Aliases

[20:17] *** vendethiel joined
[20:39] <samcv> yeah that struct didn't even exist before that commit

[20:39] <samcv> i am mostly awake let me look at it one sec

[20:50] *** vendethiel joined
[21:08] <samcv> how do I work with asan? I did ./Configure.pl --asan

[21:08] <samcv> not getting any messages

[21:09] <samcv> weird perl6 still works. but running moar i get that it's compiled with incompatible asan libs

[21:09] <samcv> ==21995==Your application is linked against incompatible ASan runtimes.

[21:11] <samcv> i have clang 3.9.1-2

[21:13] <timotimo> i haven't been able to build moarvm with asan last time i tried

[21:15] <jnthn> samcv: If you have valgrind installed, it may be easier (doesn't need a special build)

[21:15] <jnthn> It's slower, but should give at least as good diagnostics (sometimes better)

[21:15] <jnthn> If you're on Linux valgrind should be a really easy install

[21:21] <samcv> ok

[21:21] <samcv> i have valgrind

[21:22] <jnthn> \o/

[21:22] <jnthn> There's a perl6-valgrind-m script btw

[21:22] <jnthn> Which makes things super convenient, except on the occasion it doesn't :)

[21:23] <samcv> yeah i have used it. i made my own perl6-callgrind script as well

[21:25] <jnthn> ooh

[21:27] <jnthn> I wondered a bit about making the perl6-valgrind-m respect a VALGRIND_TOOL env var or something so I could do VALGRIND_TOOL=massif perl6-valgrind-m ...

[21:27] <jnthn> Which may be neater than a proliferation of scripts

[21:29] <timotimo> right

[21:38] <samcv> jnthn, how do i do leakcheck full using the valgrind script?

[21:45] <jnthn> samcv: Lsast time I needed that I just edited it and put the arg after the valgrind call

[21:45] <samcv> kk

[21:45] <jnthn> (and was careful not to commit it :))

[21:45] <samcv> heh

[21:46] <jnthn> Maybe a generic VALGRIND_ARGS would be more useful

[21:51] <jnthn> samcv: Might need to loosen stuff up here: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/HLL/Grammar.nqp#L157

[21:51] <jnthn> ohh

[21:51] <jnthn> Wow, we allow comments inside of \c[...] ??

[21:51] <samcv> why‚Ä¶

[21:52] <jnthn> I have no clue!

[21:52] <samcv> it's basically already commented :P

[21:52] <jnthn> Just reading the grammar and guessing :P

[21:53] <jnthn> (Guessing that's why # is special-cased, I mean. But it calls <.ws> which will parse a comment.

[21:55] <timotimo> we're mad!

[21:55] <samcv> ok i got asan working

[22:02] <jnthn> Nice

[22:02] <jnthn> games &

[22:02] <samcv> ok I fixed asan. will PR in a sec

[22:07] <Geth> MoarVM: samcv++ created pull request #499: Fix ASAN errors in generate_codepoints_by_name

[22:07] <Geth> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/499

[22:08] <lizmat> ah, the infamous off-by-one plot!

[22:08] <samcv> yeah.

[22:08] <samcv> i had to change it to iterate down instead of up

[22:09] <samcv> well I maybe shouldn't have. i guess I _could_ have done it from 0

[22:09] <samcv> oh well it works now and still does every alias

[22:10] <lizmat> I'll leave it to jnthn to merge, since it is not a blocker for you now, right ?

[22:11] <samcv> no error results

[22:11] <samcv> if it was off by the opposite side it would fault

[23:58] * jnthn checks le PR
