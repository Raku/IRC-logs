[19:45] <jnthn> o/ samcv

[19:53] <timotimo> i wonder what compiler optimisations we are missing out on by using msvc instead of msvcpp

[23:01] <timotimo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/525 - samcv should we close this? i don't think it'd serve well as a tracking issue for "we need to be able to take non-normalized unicode data into our strings"

[23:01] <samcv> yeha close

[23:01] <samcv> was resolved

[23:02] <samcv> closed now :)

[23:03] <timotimo> there's a pull request for CStructArray waiting for a review ...

[23:03] <samcv> yeah... if i knew anything about that i would review it!

[23:03] <samcv> are you qualified timotimo

[23:05] <timotimo> phew. a little bit

[23:05] <timotimo> right now i'm packing so i can drive home to ma parants tomorrow early in the morning

[23:05] <timotimo> and i won't be code-reviewing on the highway :D

[23:07] <timotimo> i think i rebased and merged the branch that belongs to #503 (pahole-related struct optimization)

[23:07] <timotimo> i should have a closer look and close the PR in that case

[23:07] <timotimo> actually, i can just run pahole over it now and see what's what

[23:09] <timotimo> wow, jeez

[23:09] <timotimo> there's 216 bytes around jmp_buf that are padding
