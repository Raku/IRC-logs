[06:08] <brrt> ohai samcv

[06:08] <samcv> i have been told if i don't like the license libtommath is under and think public domain is technicaly not a license and WTFPL is not a real license either to fork the project and edit the license file. and show my lawyers the fork

[06:09] <samcv> https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/issues/76

[06:09] <samcv> ahh

[06:09] *** domidumont joined
[06:09] <brrt> hang on

[06:09] <samcv> yeah read that. will explain better than me typing words.

[06:09] <samcv> kk

[06:09] <samcv> take your time

[06:11] <brrt> it appears to me we're dealing with the sort of person who would pick WTFPL

[06:12] <samcv> i don't think they are the author though they are a member

[06:12] <samcv> ah yes brrt  heh

[06:12] <samcv> and they cite OSI and what they said about public domain to defend the WTFPL

[06:12] <samcv> but then OSI says

[06:12] <samcv> It's no different from dedication to the public domain. Author has submitted license approval request

[06:12] <samcv> â€“ author is free to make public domain dedication. Although he agrees with the recommendation, Mr.

[06:12] <samcv> Michlmayr notes that public domain doesn't exist in Europe. Recommend: Reject.

[06:12] <samcv> ^this about WTFPL

[06:12] <brrt> yeah, so  if somebody wants to aggressively not care about licenses, it's going to be difficult to make them

[06:13] <samcv> may respond later. typed something up but going to relax and think a bit first

[06:13] <samcv> maybe better to contact the creator of the project idk we'll see where this goes. i only submitted it 8 hours ago

[06:13] <brrt> sure

[06:13] <brrt> what i would try and do is convince them to switch to something bog-standard like MIT

[06:13] <samcv> looks like they have 3 commits to that repo total

[06:13] <samcv> yeah MIT is fine

[06:14] <samcv> i suggested CC-0 because of the creators wanting it in public domain

[06:14] <brrt> with the argument that an unclear license could make their software *less* useful

[06:14] <samcv> yeah. if you want public domain why not license it under like

[06:14] <samcv> every single osi approved licesne

[06:15] <samcv> see https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/issues/76 XD

[06:15] <samcv> err oops

[06:15] <brrt> because i guarantee you that WTFPL will make suits nervous

[06:15] <samcv> here's the link https://github.com/Juerd/p6-mqtt/issues/3

[06:15] <samcv> it makes me nervous

[06:15] <samcv> and i'm not even a lawyer

[06:15] <brrt> well, not without reason

[06:15] *** domidumont joined
[06:15] <samcv> i should make a new license that has the lowest wordcount possible

[06:16] <samcv> and that person will LOVE it

[06:17] <samcv> unless the wtfpl license tells me i can change the licens to whatever i want (in which case it'd probably be more viable to be honest) then not going to fork and change the license...

[06:17] <brrt> yeah, i don't know how that works

[06:17] <samcv> that's like. way worse.

[06:17] <samcv> show that to my 'lawyers' and then they find out i lied to them

[06:18] <brrt> i *think* given the intention to put it in public domain, you'd probably be in the clear, but it doesn't make me any happier either

[06:18] <samcv> and then like. fire me or have to review all the software for everything i have asked them to check

[06:18] <samcv> yeah

[06:18] <samcv> i mean public domain is really not legal unless it's dual licensed or whatever. under like. any sane license

[06:19] <brrt> so yeah. i'd say cool down, and come back later with a well-reasoned argument about how a proper license will help enterprises take up libtommath for great glory

[06:19] <samcv> it's odd that that persons comments on WTFPL look *exactly* like the creator of WTFPL has made on hackernews

[06:19] <brrt> :-)

[06:19] <samcv> yep

[19:39] <Zoffix> Well, that was a guess at least.

[19:43] <timotimo> hm, can i "just" extract an .msi?

[19:43] <timotimo> like, on linux, with only wine?

[19:44] * timotimo downloads

[19:46] <MasterDuke_> cabextract maybe?

[19:47] <timotimo> msiexec /a allegedly

[19:48] <timotimo> well, nm doesn't understand the .dll

[19:48] <timotimo> oh yeah telemeh is in there

[19:49] <timotimo> well, it contains the string "telemeh.c"

[19:49] <timotimo> no clue what exactly that'd mean?

[19:49] <MasterDuke_> gcc -c -fPIC -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Werror=declaration-after-statement -O3 -DNDEBUG -g3  -D_REENTRANT -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -fPIC -DHAVE_TELEMEH -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Werror=declaration-after-statement -O3 -DNDEBUG  -I/home/dan/Source/perl6/install/include/libatomic_ops \     -I/home/dan/Source/perl6/install/include/dyncall -I/home/dan/Source/perl6/install/include/moar \     -I/home/dan/Source/perl6/install/in

[19:49] <MasterDuke_> when building rakudo

[19:49] <timotimo> yeah, what about it?

[19:50] <MasterDuke_> -DHAVE_TELEMEH

[19:50] <timotimo> yeah

[19:50] <timotimo> so? :)

[19:50] <timotimo> that only has an effect on the headers

[19:50] <timotimo> oh, not even

[19:55] <timotimo> only on the .c

[20:04] <timotimo> i can't run it with wine because i need a 64bit wine installation first

[20:04] <timotimo> and have to switch stuff around

[20:06] <MasterDuke_> i always keep a 32bit and 64bit wineprefix around and then have this in my .bashrc: alias wine32='WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine.32/ wine'; alias wine64='WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine.64/ wine'

[20:07] <timotimo> i always have to use the alternatives mechanism to also switch the wineserver around

[20:08] <MasterDuke_> ah. arch doesn't use alternatives

[20:09] <timotimo> oh, but maybe

[20:09] <timotimo> maybe WINEARCH would do that

[22:12] <timotimo> oh!

[22:13] <timotimo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/277#issuecomment-299036103 - this is bad!

[22:13] <timotimo> oh, wait

[22:13] <timotimo> i think i might have misunderstood

[22:14] <timotimo> are we putting -Werror=... into our CFLAGS?

[22:14] <timotimo> cflags => -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Werror=declaration-after-statement

[22:14] <timotimo> bah

[22:14] <timotimo> we should not be forcing LibraryMake and others to set this flag on C code they happen to be compiling
