[03:33] <MasterDuke> would anybody mind merging https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/626 if there aren't any questions/concerns? it'd be nice to get it in so i don't have to keep updating for new oplist changes and force pushing. thanks

[03:53] * samcv looks

[03:58] <samcv> hmm those strlen calls colud probably be turned into string[0] != NULL though that's just what i would have done. since it's only called if the env var is set, the performance nick is not really an issue

[04:00] <samcv> though you can just shorten that to string[0] and make it cleaner

[04:00] <samcv> then you don't have to make the strlen calls

[04:01] <geekosaur> <nit> NULL is a pointer, and on some OSes this is enforced </nit>

[04:02] <geekosaur> (that is' you can't assume it will work as an (int) or (char) or etc.)

[04:02] <samcv> yeah you don't need to put NULL

[04:02] <samcv> you can just have it eval using integer logic

[04:02] <samcv> if (string[0]) works fine

[04:04] <samcv> and where you want to check if the length is 0, if (!string[0])

[04:05] <samcv> geekosaur, also thanks for the tip about that

[04:05] <geekosaur> well, it's more of a portability gotcha

[04:05] <samcv> char is essentially integer based anyway so only should do NULL if it's a pointer

[04:05] <geekosaur> on many systems it's just #define NULL 0 and that works

[04:05] <samcv> though a compilier may do what you mean

[04:05] <geekosaur> but a very few to #define NULL ((void *) 0)]

[04:05] <geekosaur> ...typoes

[04:06] <geekosaur> but a very few do #define NULL ((void *) 0)

[04:06] <geekosaur> (hypothetically someone could use a const as well.)

[04:08] *** hoelzro joined
[04:09] <samcv> i'm going to change all the unneeded strlen in the file. all the ones we only care if == 0 or != 0 and don't need the actual value

[04:16] <samcv> geekosaur, do you think we want to print to stderr when we have certain variables enabled, like SPESH log on or whatever

[04:16] <samcv> print to stderr that we are outputting to stuff to "XYZfile.txt" or whatever

[14:01] <brrt> it's probably right, and it probably serves a purpose

[14:02] <brrt> i don't like the compile-time split between having libffi and not having it

[14:02] <brrt> markmont++ for making it though

[14:05] <markmont> I don't know the history between dyncall and libffi in MoarVM, but it seems to me that libffi has more features than what gets used by default, which is dyncall.  One way to avoid the complie-time split is to just get rid of dyncall and bundle libffi as a 3rdparty submodule -- but this is a fairly radical change and I'm not proposing it.

[14:08] <brrt> also, i'm stil in denial about the need for this patch

[14:20] <markmont> brrt: No, your points are good ones.  From my perspective, this is just about making Rakudo Perl 6 run on hardened platforms without the person who installs it jumping through difficult, platform-specific hoops and potentially giving up and using some other language instead.

[14:20] <brrt> yeah, i can see that point as well

[14:20] <jnthn> So far as I remember, libffi is a pain to build on Windows, so dyncall is at least preferable there

[14:21] <brrt> but windows doesn't do W^X

[14:21] <brrt> yet

[14:21] <markmont> On NetBSD 8, the choice is between "build Rakudo with --moar-option='--has-libffi'" and "be sure the installer runs paxctl -M .../perl6/bin/moar before building NQP"

[14:21] <jnthn> brrt: Yes, I'm explaining why I'd not care to drop dyncall :)

[14:22] <brrt> to be really honest, i don't see the problem with adding that to our build system

[14:22] <brrt> (the paxctl ....)

[14:22] <markmont> On SELinux, the alternative is "why are you enabling deny_execmem, don't do that!" / "well, write and install a local SELinux policy that runs moar in its own SELinux domain and grants it the execmem permission".

[14:22] <jnthn> markmont: I figure the first one is easier in that it can be handled as part of packaging?

[14:23] <brrt> also, i have (rephrasing) a 'bias to insource', why don't we do the equivalent thing ourself

[14:23] <brrt> matter of fact

[14:23] <markmont> Making Rakudo work on NetBSD and SELinux with mprotect() could both be handled as a part of packaging, yes.

[14:23] <brrt> can we not redo the API so that we get a 'swap this read/writeable pointer with a read/execable pointer'

[14:24] <brrt> and then do the 'difficult' thing (whatever it is that libffi does) only on platforms that we need it

[14:24] <markmont> brrt: I considered that.  We'd need to internally allocate an additional pointer or two worth of storage to store the addresses, so we can produce them on demand.

[14:25] <markmont> It seems more complicated, code-wise.

[14:25] <brrt> right

[14:25] <brrt> but more contained, i'd argue

[14:25] <brrt> and considerably less weird than having two-pointers-to-the-same-thing

[14:25] <brrt> i mean, you could have a struct MVMExecMemory { …. }

[14:26] <markmont> Except the two-pointers-the-the-same-thing is what the security experts are pushing, rightly or wrongly.  So I was keeping it in line with what other people might expect.

[14:28] <brrt> oh, they can push that all you like. it's just that it's not part of the interface i want to reason about

[14:28] <brrt> *they

[14:29] <brrt> i want to have a simple notion of: allocate rwx memory, get writable, get executable, destroy

[14:29] <brrt> also, people honestly don't expect that much :-P

[14:29] <markmont> :)

[14:30] <brrt> it's tricky to get people to care about memory management internals :-)

[14:30] <brrt> (they care more about not having written it in rust, but that is another matter)

[14:32] <markmont> I think it will be more code and complexity to implement your notion on platforms that enforce W^X, but I'm willing to rewrite the patch that way if you like in order to get a simpler and cleaner API.

[14:32] <brrt> on the other hand, like jnthn said, it s pretty much sane

[14:32] <jnthn> I guess if we do it the way brrt is suggesting then we will solve it for anyone who builds with dyncall also...

[14:33] <markmont> No, we'd have to reimplement a fairly hefty chunk of libffi in order to solve it for people who build with dyncall.  We can do that, of course, if we want.

[14:34] <brrt> hmmm

[14:34] <jnthn> Ah, OK

[14:34] <brrt> so i guess we have three alternatives

[14:34] <brrt> one

[14:34] <brrt> accept the patch as is

[14:34] <brrt> two

[14:35] <brrt> modify the patch to contain the changes in a single API that hides the per-platform differences

[14:35] <brrt> three

[14:35] <brrt> modify our build system to install the right flags on hardened platforms

[14:35] <markmont> That sounds accurate.

[14:36] <brrt> okay

[14:36] <jnthn> Might 3 be considered a bit antisocial?

[14:36] <brrt> why?

[14:36] <markmont> Note that option 3 means that sudo needs to work in order to get something that functions on a hardened platform, otherwise you'll get what we have now.

[14:36] <jnthn> Or wait, did I misunderstand it?

[14:36] <brrt> ah, i see, that's a disadvantage, yes

[14:36] <jnthn> I just worry that a build system that changes flags on the target users's platform might not go down too well

[14:37] <jnthn> s/flags/security-related configuration/

[14:37] <brrt> they'd be localized changes to the moar binary only, i think

[14:37] <brrt> that's how i understood them

[14:37] <markmont> brrt: yes

[14:37] <jnthn> Oh, I see

[14:37] <jnthn> OK, it's less bad

[14:37] <brrt> well, we'll get some flames for that, for sure\

[14:38] <brrt> 'why does your stupid binary set up these insecure flags? don't you like user security?'

[14:38] <markmont> But, we'd be granting ourselves access that is not default.  This would be documented, of course, and the owner of the system could undo or disable it if they didn't like it.

[14:38] <brrt> correct

[14:38] <brrt> so it is a *bit* antisocial still

[14:38] <markmont> This started out as a flame on the perl6-compiler mailing list.  I picked it up because I run my Linux systems with SELinux and deny_execmem.

[14:38] <markmont> ...so I was interested in improving the situation.

[14:39] <markmont> In other words, we already got a flame :)

[14:39] <brrt> hehe

[14:39] <brrt> yeah

[14:39] <jnthn> The flame being what?

[14:39] <brrt> to be fully honest, i found the 'binary nqp blob' thing being more worrisome

[14:39] <markmont> "You suck for not working with W^X"

[14:39] <jnthn> Ah

[14:39] <brrt> 'you suck for so many reasons', it was more like

[14:39] <brrt> :-P

[14:40] <brrt> and rakudo star didn't have signed builds

[14:40] <markmont> Yeah, here's the message, the W^X part is near the end: http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/2017/07/msg16180.html

[14:46] <brrt> oh by the way

[14:46] <brrt> panicking because we can't JIT something is not good

[14:46] <brrt> we do it in some places

[14:47] <brrt> we really shouldn't

[14:47] <brrt> panicking because the JIT is in an inconsistent state is also different from panicking because we couldn't allocate memory

[14:47] <brrt> we can always not JIT

[14:48] <brrt> (which is by the way also an acceptable way to go)

[14:48] <markmont> I originally had that as disabling JIT.  I changed it to panic, though, because if it fails it almost certainly means malloc() failed.  And in that case, I thought we should panic rather than proceed and have the *next* malloc fail.

[14:48] <brrt> but this is special malloc

[14:49] <brrt> anyway. thanks for the PR. I'll think about it some more

[14:49] <markmont> Yes, although "it depends".  On most platforms it will be regular malloc().  libffi will only do the mapping to a temporary file and use its special malloc if it needs to.

[14:49] <markmont> With that said, I'm not opposed to changing it to just disable JIT.

[15:06] <brrt> okay, i was walking on the way to the train and another option occured to me

[15:07] <brrt> what if we probe our ability to get executable memory at build-time, and disable the JIT (with a message and an explanation) on those platform where it won't work

[15:08] <brrt> because that's option 4: disable the JIT by default for platforms that are 'hardened' in this way

[15:08] <brrt> they can still get the extra performance boost, but they'll have to jump through some hoops to do so

[15:09] *** zakharyas joined
[15:11] <markmont> brrt: If we did that, I'd say that the behavior should be to just change the default value of MVM_DISABLE_JIT=1.  That way, if they jump through the extra hoops they can simply set MVM_DISABLE_JIT=0 and not have to rebuild.   I personally prefer having W^X support, but your option 4 would work and be an improvement over what we have now.

[15:12] <brrt> so, stupid question time agian

[15:13] <jnthn> I'd prefer that we try to provide some W^X support also

[15:13] <brrt> does luajit work on openbsd

[15:13] <brrt> hmmm

[15:13] <jnthn> I'm not convinced by the security mechanism, but it's not really important whether I am or not.

[15:13] <brrt> eh, netbsd

[15:13] <jnthn> What's important is the experience Perl 6 users on such platforms get.

[15:14] <jnthn> If other language's JITs fall apart then it's an oportunity for us to be better. :)

[15:14] <brrt> :-) i'm asking specifically about luajit because i have the sources checked out and they do the same thing as we do

[15:16] <brrt> i'd really like to discuss with some of the experts who thought this up

[15:17] <brrt> because i'm just…. still confused about it all

[15:18] <timotimo> jnthn: i'm looking into rebuilding the spesh graph after our first pass of inlining and bb elimination; do you think it's worth trying to manipulate the spesh graph into the new form or just codegen the flat representation and completely rebuild the graph from that?

[15:19] <jnthn> I'm not sure we need to do that

[15:19] <jnthn> I'd (1) fuse BBs with a single successor after spesh, and (2) recalculate the dominance tree

[15:20] <jnthn> It should still be in fine SSA form

[15:20] <timotimo> OK, rebuilding the dominance tree; would that also mean rewriting the versions of variables?

[15:20] <timotimo> or just which BBs dominate which other BBs?

[15:20] <jnthn> No, just which dominate which

[15:21] <jnthn> So we can walk in order

[15:21] <jnthn> I don't think we need to go re-establishing all the facts

[15:21] <jnthn> I mean, since we already have the dead writer thing...

[15:22] <jnthn> The PHI merges should be straightened out

[15:24] <jnthn> What are you wanting to acehive by doing the rebuild of it, BTW?

[15:25] <markmont> brrt: I took a look at the luajit v2.1 branch and agree that it doesn't support hardended systems.  Google V8 does not, either.

[15:25] <timotimo> i'm wondering if the versions get kind of out of sync by some of the optimizations i made (which tend to be a little sloppy)

[15:25] <jnthn> timotimo: Ah. If so we should really clear than up

[15:26] <jnthn> timotimo: That's exactly the kind of hackiness I've been trying to get rid of in spesh

[15:26] <timotimo> in case the BBs can't actually be fused because of bb-splitting ops, should i put the BBs in the linear order they'd be in?

[15:26] <jnthn> Normally, a little later when we manage to opt a bit more aggressively

[15:27] <jnthn> I think we'd probably be better off just trying to arrange doing inlines "in the right place" rather than at the end

[15:27] <jnthn> Then we'd save two gotos per inlined thing too

[15:28] <jnthn> I don't think there's any blocker for doing it by ow

[15:28] <jnthn> *now

[15:28] <jnthn> It's just a case of splicing it into the linear_next correct and renumbering (the numbers are only really used for debug output anyway)

[15:28] <jnthn> I'd probably leave the goto at return in as there can be multiple return points

[15:36] <brrt> markmont: does that patch actually work?

[15:36] <jnthn> (And the last one will be remvoed for you by the opt that gets rid of unrequired gotos)

[15:36] <brrt> speicifcally, does the free bit work

[15:36] <brrt> because

[15:36] <brrt> dasm_encode will just overwrite whatever is in 'writeable memory'

[15:37] <brrt> which is in this case an initialized ffi_closure object

[15:37] <brrt> which has pointers to the table from which it is allocated (which contains the free list)

[15:39] <brrt> and the pointer to *code is a part of the page that is allocated for the table

[15:39] <markmont> As far as I can tell, yes, it all works.  I did instrument jit/compile.c though and found that MVM_jit_destroy_code does not get called in any of the scenarios I tested, which include running the Rakudo spectest and doing a `zef install Bailador` with all dependencies.

[15:39] <brrt> hmmmmm

[15:39] <brrt> and you don't run into cases where you overwrite the page

[15:39] <brrt> then something magical magic is going on for sure

[15:40] <jnthn> Well, I guess we'd only collect JITted code if we had an EVAL that got hot :)

[15:41] <brrt> check out the definition of ffi_closure

[15:41] <brrt> https://github.com/libffi/libffi/blob/master/include/ffi.h.in#L288

[15:41] <brrt> and ffi_closures_alloc: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/blob/master/src/closures.c#L198

[15:41] <brrt> oh, wait a minute

[15:42] <brrt> there are multiple definitions of that function

[15:42] <brrt> some evil stuff

[15:42] <jnthn> grmbl

[15:44] <brrt> (yay bugs)

[15:44] <brrt> anyway, that gives me option 5

[15:44] <brrt> we can 3rdparty dlmalloc, just like libffi

[15:45] <brrt> no, never mind that suggestion

[15:48] <brrt> on the other hand

[15:48] <brrt> can't we dualmap the page as writeable ourselves

[15:48] <brrt> eh, executable

[15:50] <markmont> Yes, but we have to do it by mapping to an actual unlinked file, which involves trying a lot of things.  Then, we have to have a way to allocate and free memory from the mapped regions, which is what libffi uses dlmalloc for.  I figured that since MoarVM already had the option to use libffi, why reinvent the wheel?

[21:25] <MasterDuke> samcv: thanks

[21:25] <samcv> np :) so the coverage ops will let us selectively check coverage right, that sounds pretty useful

[21:28] <MasterDuke> yeah

[21:28] <MasterDuke> i plan to add support for it to coverable

[21:29] <MasterDuke> but it will allow you to see coverage of just the code you run, excluding whatever runs at startup for example

[21:32] <MasterDuke> gonna add the op to nqp and bump its moar_revision

[21:34] <samcv> ignoremark is ready for release now. added bunch of tests to roast plus new (previosly the op was untested in nqp tests) nqp tests

[22:26] <timotimo> huh, i got back to the 'puter a *bit* later than i expected

[22:32] <timotimo> the bump came in while an earlier commit was being tested or something?

[22:33] <MasterDuke> probably, there were a couple bumps

[22:38] <timotimo> glad to see coveragecontrol be merged

[22:42] <MasterDuke> likewise. now to update coverable...

[23:41] <MasterDuke> timotimo: have you seen this before? https://travis-ci.org/perl6/nqp/jobs/264930803 the other jobs were fine, i'm not sure that it's actually something specific to my code

[23:43] <timotimo> huh, that's not good

[23:44] <timotimo> it shouldn't do that

[23:44] <timotimo> all your code does is put some optional stuff in that doesn't even get touched during the build process

[23:44] <timotimo> i don't think it's your code that did anything here

[23:45] <MasterDuke> good (and bad)

[23:48] <timotimo> problems like this one should be findable through nursery size reduction and gc debugging increase, though

[23:50] <MasterDuke> dogbert17_: you are good at tracking this sort of thing down, if you feel so inclined there's an `MoarVM panic: Heap corruption detected: pointer 0x2ad2a40ba450 to past fromspace` hiding somewhere in the NQP build

[23:52] <MasterDuke> .tell dogbert17_ https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2017-08-15#i_15021638 if you're interested
