[12:30] * jnthn waves from the train

[12:33] <brrt> \o jnthn

[12:33] <brrt> train from-to where?

[12:33] <jnthn> Praha - Hamburg

[12:34] <nwc10> what's in Hamburg? Wind?

[12:34] <brrt> snow?

[12:35] <ilmari> lunch?

[12:35] <nwc10> ilmari++

[12:35] <jnthn> nwc10: Actually, getting off it at Buchen and then up to Lubeck. :)

[12:35] <jnthn> Actually...lunch is NOT on this train, which is missing its restaurant car. :(

[12:36] <moritz> "s√§nk ju for trafelling with deutsche bahn!"

[12:37] <jnthn> This is Ceske Drahy, who normally do nice noms

[12:37] <nwc10> and nice beer?

[12:38] <jnthn> When there's a restaurant car, there's typically a beer tap

[12:38] <nwc10> oooh

[12:38] <ilmari> nice

[12:38] <jnthn> Alas, not on this one

[12:39] <ilmari> :(

[12:39] * jnthn wonders if the wifi keeps working once we cross the German border

[12:39] <nwc10> I liked the overnight train from Vienna to (in our case) Dresden  (GPW2015 IIRC) - despite those two end points, run by Hungarian railways

[12:39] <nwc10> Czech beer at Hungarian prices

[12:40] <jnthn> :-)

[12:40] <jnthn> I think that train is no more, alas

[12:40] <nwc10> run by them because it exhanged halves midway with a train from Budapest, and after the shunting, half went to Berlin, half into Poland

[12:40] <nwc10> shame, although I found I didn't sleep well on it

[12:41] <nwc10> probably going to fly to GPW-2018, unless domm really twists my arm

[12:41] <jnthn> I'm thinking about going to that.

[12:41] <jnthn> Will do the train

[12:41] <nwc10> it's up stairs!

[12:42] <jnthn> 3 floors of 'em

[12:42] <nwc10> (if they thought that made it safe from Daleks, think again...)

[12:42] <jnthn> Also, some way from Cologne itself

[12:44] <nwc10> Schorndorf was billed as "Schorndorf (near Stuttgart)" and was really nice

[12:44] <nwc10> one slightly long (but not by London standards) train from the airport, and then not much more travel until the trip back

[12:50] <brrt> where's GPW this year?

[12:51] <nwc10> seemingly "in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'" the way we're describing it

[12:52] <nwc10> Bergisch Gladbach. 44 Min. by public transport (Linie S 11) away from Cologne cathedral/central railway station.  --

[12:52] <nwc10> http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2018/

[12:52] <nwc10> 44 minutes - closer than Stansted

[12:53] <nwc10> closer than Gatwick to London once you factor in the walking and the queue for immigration
