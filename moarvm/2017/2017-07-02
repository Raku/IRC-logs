[03:50] <samcv> hmm weird. i have some code. if i compile it in gcc i get a segfault

[03:50] <samcv> if i compile it in clang i don't

[04:14] <samcv> eliminated some of the size by not storing min/max inside the array. also the collation_keys i can fit one into 32 bits

[04:45] <samcv> also working on how to avoid going across the full length of the string when possible. since the secondary and tertiary collation elements get pushed after the primary. so

[04:47] <samcv> "ca" => [.0706.0020.0002], [.06D9.0020.0002] => 0x0706, 0x06D9, {level seperator aka 0x0}, 0x20, 0x20, {level seperator aka 0x0}, 0x2, 0x2

[04:49] <samcv> as you can see since the secondary go after the primary and there is a level seperator i need to come up with a way to modify the way it does it in my branch now with primary,secondary tertiary together and process all the primary first, then pull more if needed (they're equal and haven't reached the end of either string which would cause a level seperator to appear)

[19:34] <timotimo> just read jnthn's post. nice report :) jnthn++

[22:43] <jnthn> :)

[22:43] <timotimo> oh hey there you are :)

[22:44] <jnthn> Yeah, though gonna rest up in 10 mins or so

[22:44] <jnthn> Planning to continue on the spesh re-working tomorrow

[22:44] <timotimo> sure :)

[22:46] <samcv> making more progress on MoarVM collation code :)

[22:46] <samcv> luckily i was pretty close to what i said i needed to do yesterday already, so only needed some minor tweaks and pushing a 0 values collation key when reaching the end of a string

[22:49] <samcv> need to write up my progress report as well :)

[22:52] <timotimo> the fact that i still haven't worked any more on the unicode name decompression thingie is haunting me :|

[22:54] <samcv> seen any ghosts?

[22:54] <jnthn> samcv: Nice; always happy to see improvements to our Unicode support. :)

[22:55] <jnthn> samcv: Any idea how much work Unicode 10 support will be?

[22:56] <samcv> i haven't looked at it yet :P

[22:56] <samcv> but i don't think much

[22:56] * samcv checks

[22:56] <samcv> nope

[22:57] <samcv> well

[22:57] <samcv> there's emoji flag tags now

[22:57] <jnthn> Yeah, just glancing through it. It looks less bad than 9.

[22:57] <samcv> aside from that there is changes to the unicode collation document, but that is NYI so

[22:58] <samcv> but the emoji tag sequences will be interesting to implement

[22:58] <samcv> http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-12.html#flag-emoji-tag-sequences

[22:58] <samcv> flags!. well i think the flags are now fully working. i still needed to make a few impromements but it does work i believe. passes all flag tests now

[22:59] * samcv thinks and wonders if i wrote abotu that in my report or not

[22:59] <samcv> or maybe i did that this month... hm. will have to look at git log :-D

[23:12] <jnthn> :-)

[23:12] <jnthn> 'night o/

[23:15] <samcv> night o/

[23:26] <timotimo> night!
