[08:24] <brrt> ohai samcv

[08:24] <samcv> hey :)

[08:24] <samcv> got my graphemebreaktest PR to roast, it uses grammar to parse the test file

[08:24] <samcv> pretty fun

[08:25] <samcv> and i just put the unicode test file inside 3rdparty of roast because easier for people to refer to it. and doesn't take much extra time to process it anyway

[08:25] <samcv> like a sec to run the whole test

[08:55] <jnthn> heh, read that as grapheme breakfast...

[09:20] <samcv> yum

[09:20] <samcv> jnthn, can you check the file layout here https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/267/files

[09:21] <samcv> this PR is ready to go. but i wanted to ask somebody about the layout of the LICENSE file before merging it

[09:21] <samcv> and the 3rdparty stuff

[09:39] <jnthn> samcv: Just taken a look, don't see anything on concern. +1

[09:39] <jnthn> *of

[09:39] <samcv> yay ok gonna merge

[09:40] <samcv> this is much more better than the old one

[09:40] <samcv> lemme see how many false positives it found. it was at least a couple

[11:06] <brrt> wtf!

[11:06] <timotimo> whoops, that's not nice

[11:06] <timotimo> isn't there a law against that?

[11:06] <brrt> well, law enforcement is clearly lacking

[11:09] <brrt> also, adium, fuuuu

[11:09] <brrt> why don't font sze increase just … work!

[11:11] <timotimo> ugh, fonts

[11:15] <brrt> yeah, i'm considering swithcin over to irssi

[11:15] <timotimo> weechat, please? :P

[11:16] <brrt> is weechat better somehow/

[11:16] <brrt> ?

[11:16] <timotimo> it's the best, actually ;)

[11:17] <brrt> obviously

[11:17] <brrt> but

[11:17] <brrt> if you go to irrs.i.org

[11:17] <brrt> *ahem*

[11:17] <brrt> irssi.org

[11:17] <brrt> you'll notice one of the screen shots

[11:17] <brrt> has BeOS stying

[11:17] <brrt> and with regards to BeOS, I say, screw open source

[11:18] <brrt> if I could switch to that today, I would

[11:19] * timotimo waits for that screenshot to appear

[11:19] <timotimo> if you like beos, why not try haiku? ;)

[11:20] <brrt> haiku isn't as good....

[11:20] <brrt> but yeah

[11:20] <timotimo> have you tried it? i have only very briefly tried it :(

[11:20] <timotimo> have you heard of Zeta? it's been on a german teleshopping channel for many years

[11:20] <brrt> heard of it

[11:21] <timotimo> i believe it's in some way based on BeOS?

[11:22] <timotimo> hm. maybe it's time to try rakudo on haiku

[11:22] <brrt> yeah, it's BeOS 6 that was never released or something

[11:24] <brrt> anyway, what's better about weechat, then

[11:25] <timotimo> it has a few cool features right out of the box. one of them is an "intelligent" filter that throws out uninteresting joins/parts/quits

[11:25] <brrt> oh, that's nice

[11:25] <timotimo> you can combine buffersin a way that lets you either see all messages intertwined or show only one and switch between which one you see

[11:26] <timotimo> it comes with something that handles scripts out of the box, whereas in irssi you'd always install scriptassist first

[12:05] <timotimo> btw, there's a bunch of things missing from libuv for haiku in particular

[12:05] <timotimo> so no moarvm for haiku just yet

[12:15] <brrt> yeah, haiku is'nt very mature atm

[12:15] <brrt> or has ever been very mature

[15:31] <nine> BeOS is great. Was great. In the 90s. Compared with the alternatives back then. On a current 8 core hyperthreading system where you really have to balance performance vs. power saving with highly dynamic hardware configuration? Probably not so much anymore...

[19:16] <samcv> anyone know if there's any issues on windows where shell needs to be used and run cannot?

[19:22] *** Ven joined
[19:23] <samcv> well regardless. it used shell piping before. and that is not even a windows thing. so should be fine to switch to run

[21:00] <brrt> yes, fixing the heap is the top priority

[21:01] <brrt> (binary heap, not as in, memory heap)

[21:02] <brrt> and i know why it happens

[21:02] <brrt> which is, i think, awesomely exciting

[21:03] <timotimo> \o/

[21:03] <brrt> it happens because when i merge live ranges, one is left 'empty', and ignroed for further processing

[21:03] *** Ven joined
[21:03] <brrt> however, empty live ranges have a 'first reference order number' of MAX_INT32

[21:03] <brrt> which completely violates the heap property

[21:04] <timotimo> oops :)

[21:04] <brrt> yes

[21:05] <brrt> the heap property is, without such 'mergers' to take into account, guaranteed by the linear order of adding the live ranges to the heap, e.g. a sorted array is also a heap

[21:05] <brrt> but, if we 'empty' the items in between, well, that ends it doesn't it

[21:07] <brrt> now, how to resolve it

[21:09] <brrt> a single linear compaction step over the worklist; or, remove the items from the heap during processing

[21:10] <brrt> lemmethink

[21:12] <brrt> removing during processing means we have to find the items in the worklist. which means that we must either track it (in the LiveRange structure itself) or find it. heap find is linear in the average case, which means that the total complexity must be greater than the single compaction step

[21:12] <brrt> the compaction step it is
