[00:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix incorrect EOF detection on seek'ed handles

[00:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[00:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: A handle could be seek'ed past end of file, resulting in seek

[00:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: position larger than file's size.

[09:04] <brrt> i'm thinking of making a merge request for the fix-memory-leaks branch

[09:04] <brrt> since i haven't found anything particularly evil recently

[09:05] <brrt> and i'm not going to make a lot of progress with the â€”full-cleanup anytime soon

[09:11] <lizmat> sounds like an idea  :-)

[16:07] <[Coke]> I hate IRC. :|

[16:08] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: why?

[16:09] <[Coke]> the 30 pages of spam, the netsplit...

[16:10] *** brrt joined
[16:10] <Voldenet> [Coke]: But you could spam any open group easily

[16:11] <[Coke]> Voldenet: are you suggesting that we could configure our IRC so as not to have to deal with that?

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> I think he is suggesting that it is unavoidable :(

[16:13] <Voldenet> Yes, I'm sitting on some networks allowing flood protection modes

[16:15] *** cognominal joined
[16:16] <Voldenet> for example this: https://wiki.swiftirc.net/wiki/Flood_control#Channel_mode_.2Bf - very useful

[16:17] <Voldenet> but it's mostly unavoidable and blockable on server side

[16:17] <[Coke]> (unavoidable)... which brings me back to my IRC rant. :)

[16:18] <Voldenet> s/server/client/

[16:18] <[Coke]> and if it's avoidable, can we please avoid it on our channels?

[16:19] <Voldenet> Sure, let's do that! :)
