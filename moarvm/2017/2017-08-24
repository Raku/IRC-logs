[01:03] <MasterDuke> i just jitted param_op_(i|o), and now INTERPOLATE doesn't bail according to the jit log, but it still doesn't show as jitted in a profile

[06:47] *** domidumont joined
[06:47] <timotimo> MasterDuke: the op ops are for when the parameter is optional, so the .i64 value could just be bogus

[06:47] <timotimo> probably zeroed out memory?

[06:47] <timotimo> i'm on my phone, so can't look at the code

[06:48] <timotimo> oh

[06:48] <timotimo> it has to kbow whether to jump or not

[06:49] <timotimo> which it does if the parameter was not passed i believe

[07:17] *** brrt joined
[07:18] <brrt> yeah, the optional ones are trickier to JIT

[07:31] <brrt> did anyone read the 'writing portable makefiles' thingy

[07:31] <brrt> now i know how to make rules that work on multiple makes

[07:33] <brrt> that one time i learned something from hacker news

[07:38] <brrt> O M G it actually

[07:48] <moritz> my problem is that whenever I need a slightly non-trivial Makefile feature, it turns out to be non-standard

[07:50] <brrt> oh, thats true

[07:50] <brrt> but

[07:50] <brrt> when do you actually  need them?

[07:50] <brrt> or, what features do you need?

[07:57] <moritz> typically stuff like running a command, and capturing the output in a variable

[07:58] <moritz> or anything else that is more than simply invoking a command, and is typically trivial to do in shell, but very nasty or impossible in cross-platform Makefile

[08:02] <brrt> right, that kind of think

[08:02] <brrt> *thing

[08:02] <brrt> that's hard yes

[15:56] <brrt> because it became a mess :-P
