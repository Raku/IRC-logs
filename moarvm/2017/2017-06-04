[07:36] <nine> I can't believe how fast rakudo is, considering that a simple getattr has to loop so much...

[07:38] <moritz> it has?

[07:39] <nine> Finding the attribute slot in the object is looping over the inheritance hierarchy to find the requested class, then loop over the attributes to find the one with a matching name

[07:41] <moritz> and I thoght we pre-compute the storage layout for each class individually

[07:41] <nine> I guess that's what spesh does

[09:42] *** cygx joined
[09:42] <cygx> o/

[09:43] <cygx> I can no longer build nqp using Strawberry Perl due to a segfault in MVM_nfg_crlf_grapheme() while generating the stage1 nqpmo.moarvm

[09:53] *** Alexdaniel joined
[10:46] <jnthn> nine: That's in the most late-bound case; in most cases a hint is provided which allows the whole search to be avoided entirely in favor of a bounds check, and spesh can eliminate the call to get_attribute entirely.

[10:48] <jnthn> (And spesh can do that in cases where the static hint mechanism can't be used too)

[11:02] *** cygx joined
[11:27] <jnthn> fwiw, that Strawberry Perl SEGV cygx mentioned happens on Windows under MSVC too

[11:27] <jnthn> I'll take a look tomorrow if nobody beats me to it

[11:30] <nine> jnthn: is it ok to commit this debugging aid? https://gist.github.com/niner/50a724956cd06e2c6f7f91962da2ca23

[11:31] <nine> I got a bit tired of re-discovering how to "what the hell is this obj" in gdb every couple of months...

[11:33] <jnthn> nine: Yes, though perhaps with a #define, and at minimum a comment saying it's not used anywhere in the rest of MoarVM but for debugging, so don't delete it as dead code :)

[11:33] <nine> Gives me: (gdb) call MVM_dump_p6opaque(tc, obj, 0)

[11:33] <nine> Stash->new(#`(from Map) $!storage=BOOTHash, #`(from Hash) $!descriptor, #`(from Stash) $!longname='A')

[11:34] <nine> jnthn: ok, can do :)

[11:34] <jnthn> Nite :)

[11:34] <jnthn> Though, uh, ->new? :)

[11:34] <nine> jnthn: is there any appropriate existing #define ?

[11:34] <nine> Err... I guess 20 years of Perl 5 are hard to ignore ;)

[11:34] <jnthn> nine: I can't think of one; I unified all of the GC debug aids under a single one a while ago

[11:38] <nine> Oh, I could automatically set the #define on Configure.pl --debug

[11:38] <jnthn> Or that

[11:38] <nine> Calling it DEBUG_HELPERS for now

[11:38] <jnthn> I think that makes sense

[12:56] <timotimo> i also had a piece of code in moar-gdb that could print out p6opaque stuff, but it's not in master yet
