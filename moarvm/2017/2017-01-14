[04:37] <samcv> .tell jnthn rewrite is gonna be great. to access the binary properties all you will need mybitfield[10].NFG_QC

[04:37] <yoleaux2> samcv: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[04:37] <samcv> :)

[04:38] <samcv> there is going to be compression for some ranges where there are no characters, like an offset. but it will be way faster

[04:38] <samcv> and determining an offset is not too bad

[04:47] <samcv> truncated version of the skeleton of what will hopefully be the rewrite https://gist.github.com/0692493144a5bb6892770a8887c0176f

[16:24] <nwc10> jnthn: ASAN found something new http://paste.scsys.co.uk/540705

[16:28] <jnthn> nwc10: Ooooh. Thank you!

[16:28] <yoleaux2> 04:37Z <samcv> jnthn: rewrite is gonna be great. to access the binary properties all you will need mybitfield[10].NFG_QC

[16:28] <jnthn> nwc10: That first backtrace is exactly what I occasionally got under GDB. On its own it's really not enlightening.

[16:29] *** stmuk joined
[16:29] <jnthn> The freed/allocated are...weird too but provide a much better idea of where to look

[16:30] <jnthn> samcv: Sounds rather nice. :-)

[16:32] <nwc10> I'm glad that it makes some sense to you

[16:33] <jnthn> Well, it doesn't make sense yet, but it gives some leads I was missing :)

[19:27] <samcv> brokenchicken, yep i know that is true. have no implemented all the packing

[19:27] <yoleaux2> 13:06Z <brrt> samcv: keep in mind that bitfield structs will still be 4 bytes wide at least

[19:27] <samcv> 4bytes on 32bit 8 on 64

[20:17] <brokenchicken> what?

[20:17] <brokenchicken> Ah.

[22:16] <samcv> the uh aligning of struct data structures and things

[22:16] <samcv> jnthn, what do you mean by leads

[22:17] <samcv> oh what nwc10 said? sorry i just woke up

[22:18] <timotimo> right, the asan output ought to give jnthn an idea where to look

[23:36] <jnthn> samcv: Yes, was talking abou tthe ASAN output :)

[23:48] * jnthn heads sleepwards
