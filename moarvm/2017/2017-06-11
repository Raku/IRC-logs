[09:11] <robertle_> I was trying to recreate a coredump from yesterday, but got a different one instead: https://gist.github.com/robertlemmen/7d71303ec38a0e0f3c7bb635de45dfa8

[09:11] <robertle_> this seems reasonably reproducible, let me know if there is anything I can do to help. it also hangs sometimes rather than crash, investigating that at the moment

[09:12] <robertle_> the program that crashes it basically just does HTTP::client queries to test a non-perl webserver

[11:14] <jnthn> robertle_: What MoarVM version?

[11:34] <jnthn> Though it doesn't matter much; either you have something that's not HEAD and upgrading will fix it, or you have HEAD and are doing stuff with Proc, in which case the rewrite of Proc in terms of Proc::Async that I'll do in the next days will fix it. :)

[11:34] <jnthn> And the MVM_io_syncstream_write_bytes in that backtrace will cease to exist by the end of next week, all being well :)

[13:04] <eveo> Any book recommendations to learn C and other bits to be able to hack on moarvm?

[13:26] *** SourceBaby joined
[14:02] <jnthn> eveo: Well, the GC handbook (second edition) if you want to understand that side of things. I learned C many years ago from probably some earlier edition of http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565923065.do

[14:03] <jnthn> Once you get to the point where you can look at something like `MVMCollectable ***foo;` and not be intimidated by the indirection, you're probably good. :)

[14:04] *** domidumont joined
[14:14] <eveo> Thanks

[14:14] <yoleaux> 13:19Z <araraloren> eveo: thanks, I just make a type mistake. It's fit what I thought.

[14:22] <jnthn> Any particular bits of MoarVM you're looking to learn about?

[14:34] *** zakharyas joined
[14:40] <eveo> Everything.

[14:53] <nine> ah, the famous three stars in the signature. I remember the blog post :)

[15:04] <jnthn> If you're writing a moving GC you're gonna end up as a 3 star C programmer

[15:05] <jnthn> Given in involves having lists (1) of locations (2) of object references (3). :)

[15:05] <jnthn> eveo: You may also want to read some of the 6buts bug-hunting posts too and try to follow them in the MoarVM source :)

[15:05] <jnthn> *6guts

[15:05] <jnthn> .oO( 6 butts )

[15:06] <eveo> Thanks. I will.

[15:06] <jnthn> Darn, it was hot enough in my apartment before I made cottage cheese...

[15:07] <lizmat> 29.7 highest here today

[15:08] <lizmat> getting some thunderstorms / rain now

[15:08] <jnthn> 28ish here

[15:08] <lizmat> inside we're still at 23 :-)

[15:08] <jnthn> I normally just use halloumi instead of making paneer. The texture's kinda right and I quite like the added saltiness.

[15:09] <jnthn> Alas, couldn't get hold of it.

[15:09] <jnthn> It's got to 26.5 in here.

[15:09] <jnthn> South facing apartment is lovely and bright...but not so great on a hot sunny day

[15:10] <jnthn> At least I do $dayjob at an office now and that stays some degrees cooler than here :)

[15:12] <timotimo> i don't have a thermometer in here, but a sign on the road said 34 degC an hour or two ago

[15:13] <jnthn> ugh

[15:15] *** ggoebel joined
[15:29] *** geekosaur joined
[15:44] <timotimo> granted, that sign might have read the temperature above the road, which was asphalt, which famously becomes pretty hot when the sun shines on it

[17:32] <robertle_> jnthn: my crashed moar was 2017.05-29-g68620c8e, but if this is in a codepath that is going away then great! I'll be running this type of code in test cases for a while, so I'll see how it goes...
