[01:17] <samcv> what is the best way to learn how to contribute or at least understand MoarVM's JIT code?

[03:41] <ugexe> so libuv 1.16.0 seems to not build on any windows configuration ive tried

[03:41] <ugexe> i sent a PR to fix the problem, so getppid will have to wait until that lands

[03:42] <ugexe> second libuv bug ive found through moarvm :P

[09:05] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[09:23] <lizmat_> good *, brrt

[09:23] <lizmat> brrt: "[02:17:54]  <samcv>	what is the best way to learn how to contribute or at least understand MoarVM's JIT code?"

[09:24] * lizmat would also like some guidance there :-)

[09:25] <brrt> oh, wow, ehm, hmmm

[09:25] <brrt> there's some documentation....

[09:25] <brrt> what part would you like to know about?

[09:27] <brrt> anyway, i have to get back to you at some later point

[10:23] <jnthn> Given the JIT takes a spesh graph as input, and a lot of the opts are performed by that stage, learning about spesh is also a worthwhile endeavor for those looking to work on performance things. I suggest going through my recent 4-part blog series side by side with the code. :)

[10:35] <nwc10> "recent"? You appear to be IRCing from the future

[10:35] <nwc10> or is "next week" the new "this week" ?

[10:42] <jnthn> haha

[10:42] <jnthn> D'oh, I finished drafting part 4 last night, then left proof-reading/posting until this evening. :)

[12:44] *** brrt joined
[12:44] <brrt> what jnthn said is also very, very true

[12:45] <brrt> interestingly, the JIT (and especially the expression JIT) takes a very different approach to its internal operations than does spesh

[12:45] <brrt> this is more interesting to C hackers than to anyone else, but whatever

[12:53] <brrt> arguably though, i'd say that spesh is more advanced, in a way, but also more difficult to use

[12:54] <brrt> â€¦ for me anyway

[12:54] <brrt> (and with use, i mean 'to hack on')

[13:11] <nine> I think spesh hacking requires fuller and often detailed knowledge about how the different parts of moarvm fit together and work.

[13:12] <jnthn> Wow, they've started digging a trench right outside of my office door.

[13:12] <nine> .oO(What do you mean by "leaving the office"?)

[13:13] <jnthn> They've been digging all the way along the street, right next to the buildings. I didn't yet figure out what they're doing.

[13:13] <nwc10> beer pipeline?

[13:13] <ilmari> for lunch?:

[13:13] <jnthn> My fantasy is "laying optical fibers for super-fast internet"

[13:14] <jnthn> Well, or what nwc10 said works very nicely also :P

[13:14] <brrt> nine: i agree, yes

[13:14] <nine> I'm sure the trench can accomodate both

[13:14] <brrt> .oO( ip-over-beer )

[13:14] <jnthn> I semi-agree, but the JIT has to also be involved in deopt and inlines :)

[13:14] <brrt> true

[13:15] <nine> Yet I've been able to to quite a few things with and to the JIT without ever worrying about those :)

[13:15] <brrt> anyway, i want to start hacking on having the stack walker instead of writing 'here am i' labels at every turn

[13:15] <brrt> and the thing i'm dreading most is to hack our build system to support it

[13:16] <brrt> because i'm fairly sure the stack walker assembly i've cooked up works

[22:45] <MasterDuke> and great series of articles

[23:17] <jnthn> MasterDuke, japhb: Thanks, fixed those :)

[23:21] <japhb> Good post, too.

[23:21] <jnthn> :)
