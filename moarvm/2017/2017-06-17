[11:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix newline translation in various encodings.

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: They didn't go through the normalizer due being automatically in

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: NFG. This meant they missed out on \r\n -> \n translation.

[16:24] <jnthn> eveo: ^^

[16:24] <eveo> jnthn++ thanks

[16:25] <jnthn> Pretty nice changelog this month :)

[17:30] <timotimo> i read on reddit that some changes that would make I/O faster were going to be kept until the next release?

[17:41] * jnthn wonders what changes those are :P

[17:42] <jnthn> I mean, it's true in so far as more improvements are possible

[17:42] <jnthn> But it's not like we've anything sat in unmerged branches

[17:43] <jnthn> There was no intentional "we'll hold this back just in case", though :)

[17:52] * jnthn found http://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-mesh-architecture-skylake-x-hedt,34806.html an interesting read

[18:27] <jnthn> bah

[18:27] <jnthn> *site :P

[18:27] <jnthn> I hope there's less typos in the updates

[18:31] <timotimo> can you figure out why the benches ain't updating any more?

[19:30] <lizmat> timotimo: perhaps it was me on the mailing list

[20:00] <timotimo> ah, yes! it was on the mailing list!

[20:06] <lizmat> which I wrote while being under the impression of what I wrote  :-)

[20:06] <jnthn> timotimo: Hm, think I saw what's wrong and fixed it. Guess we find out tonight :)

[21:44] <mj41> jnthn: Ahoj. I just noticed this regression https://gist.github.com/mj41/20c70566564283151714/revisions#diff-39859e34161f0cb6f5f50974282a2593L135

[21:46] <mj41> also bad with disabled JIT https://gist.github.com/mj41/20c70566564283151714/revisions#diff-39859e34161f0cb6f5f50974282a2593L107

[21:47] <mj41> But you probably know :-). So happy hacking. I will retest after work is done.

[21:47] <mj41> Dobrou noc.

[21:47] <jnthn> mj41: Diky moc :)

[21:47] <jnthn> mj41: I'm aware there's a regression on output; I've got a plan for solving it, but didn't get to it yet :)

[21:47] <jnthn> Thanks for supplying data on the magnitude though.

[21:47] <jnthn> It's a bit worse than I'd thought

[21:57] <mj41> In this case it make sense https://gist.github.com/mj41/6761c021135ae1cb17f9#file-gistfile1-txt-L138

[21:58] <mj41> It's weird from my amateur point of view that it is somehow related to the loop without output inside. See https://gist.github.com/mj41/20c70566564283151714#file-gistfile1-txt-L223

[22:01] <mj41> But my part is done. Will backlog tomorrow :-).

[22:04] <mj41> Díky moc za všechnu tu práci. Dobrou.

[22:05] <jnthn> :-)

[22:05] <jnthn> Dobrou noc o/

[23:03] <timotimo> that loop mj whipped up is being treated the worst way we can

[23:04] <timotimo> for example, in order to do the comparison, we box the int and then compare. then we create a p6bool from the result which we then immediately unbox_i again to check the result value

[23:05] <timotimo> there's also an attempt being made to sink something

[23:07] <timotimo> the $i is passed as an intlexref to the + operator

[23:08] <timotimo> there's 5.9k GC runs

[23:08] <timotimo> all of them about 0.9 miliseconds long, as they don't promote a single byte

[23:10] * timotimo goes to bed
