[10:10] <Geth> MoarVM: This means nqp::radix() will be JITted like nqp::radix_I() already is.

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM:

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM: Don't use the general category which is slow and requires string operations.

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM: Check that Numeric_Type=Decimal

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM:

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM: This should also speed up radix in general when it is given non A-Z, a-z or 0-9 codepoints

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM:

[10:13] <Geth> MoarVM: This also adds support for the East_Asian_Width property.

[16:25] <brrt> .tell jnthn what also leaks (at least indirectly) is the memory for the extension ops in the JIT

[16:25] <yoleaux2> brrt: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[16:26] <brrt> .tell jnthn the solution for that (and a bunch of other things) is to have a data segment and stash the extension ops memory there, which is something i've been meaning to implement

[16:26] <yoleaux2> brrt: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[16:28] <jnthn> brrt: Yeah, we don't hit that in a straight ./perl6-m -e ''

[16:29] <jnthn> But yes, I've seen the odd JIT leak show up and wondered if it might be those. Good to know it is.

[16:29] <brrt> well, that's what i think it is, might be other things

[16:29] <brrt> better said: I know it's those

[16:30] <brrt> egh, better said: I know those leak, there may be other leaks as well
