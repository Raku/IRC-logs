[00:42] <timotimo> jnthn: stdout and stderr will fail when you call "flush" on them because it tries to use fsync which isn't sensible on non-filesystem-backed streams

[00:43] <timotimo> this currently makes --target=foo end in an uncaught exception

[09:59] * JimmyZ wonders whether rakudo uses moarm's sync proc ops or not now.

[09:59] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Nope

[09:59] <jnthn> We'll kill them off

[09:59] <jnthn> And probably some NQP tests too

[09:59] <jnthn> Then we only have to maintain one set of proc ops :)

[10:00] <JimmyZ> nice killing again :)

[10:00] * jnthn likes having less code to maintain :)

[10:00] * JimmyZ too :)

[10:02] * JimmyZ wonders what's jnthn++'s plan for ea :)

[10:02] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Think it'll come after more general spesh changes, so it can be more effective

[10:03] <JimmyZ> jnthn: agrees

[10:05] <JimmyZ> the current spesh just like the jit in the master, which meeds some refactor

[10:13] <jnthn> Well, it's not so much refactoring it needs as re-visiting a bunch of the ways it does things

[11:00] *** zakharyas joined
[11:05] <brrt> hehe, spesh can be much more clever about a bunch of things

[11:06] <brrt> but that is of course true of everything
