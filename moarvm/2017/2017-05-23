[07:04] <brrt> by the way

[07:04] <brrt> tensorflow is sooo cool

[07:04] <brrt> it's like a turbocharged version of R

[07:05] <brrt> ‚Ä¶ now hang on a second

[07:05] <brrt> we have shaped arrays

[07:06] <brrt> what if perl6 would become the easiest, fastest way to use libraries like tensorflow

[07:07] <nwc10> "people would still use Python 2.7"? (I'm not sure if this is a joke. Or if even if it is, if it's funny)

[07:08] <nwc10> (but it's certainly a backhanded compliment)

[07:08] <brrt> hehe

[07:08] <brrt> yeah, it is, in a way

[07:08] <brrt> staying power

[07:09] <brrt> that is what keeps perl5 alive as well

[07:09] <brrt> aside from being, altogether, a pretty good language

[07:09] <brrt> yesterday i had another of my oracular predictions

[07:10] <brrt> (my last one was that machine learning would be a 'bog-standard, MySQL-and-a-webpage level component in 15 years. I was wrong. It's going to be much, much, much, sooner)

[07:10] <brrt> within a similar time period (let's say 10 years), we're going to have most of our existing codebase slowly rewritten or simply dwarfed by 'high-assurance' systems in 'safe' languages

[07:10] <brrt> however, rust is not going to be the leader of that pack

[07:11] <brrt> why not? because rust is pain

[07:12] <nwc10> I've not used rust. From the outside, what I like about the (intent at least) is that it's intended to be able to be used without a GC (at least, a subset of it)

[07:12] <nwc10> and that it's intended to make concurrency easy

[07:12] <nwc10> the latter should be a given of anything "new" that folks plan to migrate to, given that smart watches are now multicore

[07:14] <brrt> i can probably answer why rust is pain, with a short and example I gleaned from a blog post

[07:14] <brrt> .. maybe i can find the blog post in question

[07:15] <brrt> https://m-decoster.github.io//2017/01/16/fighting-borrowchk/ i think this was it

[07:15] <brrt> the gist of it

[07:16] <brrt> a Student struct cannot have a reference to the Classes he's supposed to follow, because the borrow checker, hates, hates, hates circular references, and you should have an effective 'join table' structure instead

[07:16] <brrt> so rather than have a pointer to a list of classes, you now have to manage a table of { class, student } pairs

[07:16] <brrt> is that more flexible? certainly

[07:17] <brrt> is that however overkill and sometimes even just the Wrong Thing? almost certainly as well

[07:17] <brrt> doesn't the developer know best? Not in rust-land he/she don't

[07:17] <brrt> that's why rust is pain

[08:38] <jnthn> morning o/

[08:40] <lizmat> o/

[08:40] <jnthn> Hm, tensorflow

[08:41] <jnthn> I was looking at that momentarily at $dayjob and thinking "hmm, Perl 6 binding"...no way that'll be something I get a $dayjob excuse to do, alas.

[08:46] <brrt> alas indeed

[08:47] * jnthn already has enough free time projects too :)
