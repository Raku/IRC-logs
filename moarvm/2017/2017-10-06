[00:42] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[00:42] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Previously quaternary collation levels were only checked

[00:42] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: for checking ties via string length. Now it also applies

[00:42] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: changes in quaternary level for codepoint.

[08:37] <rba> hi all. I'm currently try to build radkudo star 2017.07 on Solaris 10. Struggeling with different things. E.g. memmem

[08:37] <rba> I will get the latest MoarVM from github and hav a look at this one...

[08:50] <Zoffix> Sweet

[08:51] * moritz amazed that people still use solaris

[08:51] <Zoffix> :)

[08:52] <moritz> especially after Oracle fired nearly all engineers and management working on solaris: http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2017/09/04/the-sudden-death-and-eternal-life-of-solaris/

[08:52] <Zoffix> Yeah, I heard. I think rba said there were lots of banks in $location still using it or something.

[08:53] <moritz> I'm sure there's money in maintaining solaris for the next 15 or more years

[09:50] <rba_> Still have time to get it running in Solaris as Oracle meant to delivery support till 2034... ;-)

[09:53] <Guest65627> rba: if memmem is a problem, you can just try the #define that enables our copy-pasted implementation

[09:58] <dogbert17> nite samcv

[10:07] <rba> timotimo: I changed src/platform/memmem.h: #if defined(_WIN32) || defined(__APPLE__) || defined(__Darwin__) || defined(__sun)

[10:07] <rba> timotimo: yet, I have then errors on nqp tests

[10:08] <timotimo> good

[10:08] <timotimo> can you paste the errors somewhere?

[10:09] <rba> timotimo: shure, give me a sec...

[10:16] <rba> timotimo: nqp test output: https://gist.github.com/rba/6925e11391a4e50024107c6b2444165e

[10:17] <timotimo> OK, can you also ./nqp-m t/nqp/059-nqpop.t  and also  ./nqp-m t/nqp/104-method-cache.t  so we get the full output from the tests?

[10:18] <rba> timotimo: and more worse rakudo segfaulted: https://gist.github.com/rba/8369cfa00dc3e92f2cb2bfa1e09905c4

[10:19] <timotimo> stage parse could also die because of too little ram; how much free ram and swap do you have?

[10:20] <rba> timotimo: https://gist.github.com/rba/dda378519609f2703344b0d7d621b54d

[10:21] <timotimo> OK, let's look at the pow_n one first

[10:23] <timotimo> hold on, what versions are you running?

[10:24] <timotimo> there's more tests there in my version than in your output

[10:24] <rba> rakudo-star.2017.07

[10:24] <timotimo> OK, that's probably just fine

[10:25] <rba> timotimo: I have started with rakudo-star. I reached the segfault and then I get the latest MoarVM from github.

[10:25] <timotimo> can you run: nqp-m -e 'say(nqp::pow_n(1,nqp::inf)'?

[10:25] <timotimo> oh sorry

[10:25] <timotimo> nqp-m -e 'say(nqp::pow_n(1,nqp::inf))

[10:25] <timotimo> damn it

[10:25] <rba> timotimo: all the above is now from rakudo star again

[10:26] <rba> ./nqp-m -e 'say(nqp::pow_n(1,nqp::inf))'

[10:26] <rba> NaN

[10:26] <timotimo> well, that's not what we expect

[10:27] <rba> timotimo: will be off for lunch quicky...

[10:27] <timotimo> but we literally just call pow() with those values

[10:27] <timotimo> If x is +1, the result is 1.0 (even if y is a NaN).

[10:27] <timotimo> this is from "man pow"

[10:28] <timotimo> it's not a critical problem, of course. we don't use this anywhere in compilation or something

[10:28] <timotimo> it's just users will get strange results

[10:29] <rba> timotimo: maybe one of my build fixes is wrong too. here my notes: https://gist.github.com/rba/58fa69c6ac59efac7131d1da15e6e749

[10:29] <rba> timotimo: Solaris seems to be a beast

[10:30] <timotimo> anyway, for the crash you can look into stuff like setting the MVM_SPESH_DISABLE env variable to 1

[10:30] <timotimo> and seeing if that makes it better

[10:30] <timotimo> if so, try MVM_JIT_DISABLE instead (if we have jit on solaris at all)

[10:30] <timotimo> if not, it's gotta be something else

[10:31] <timotimo> rerun moarvm's Configure.pl and pass --debug=3 --optimize=0 then we can get useful info out of gdb

[10:32] <timotimo> i'll be afk for a bit

[12:40] <timotimo> right, we don't upload the build results anywhere

[12:41] <timotimo> the whateverables have a build for every commit

[12:41] <timotimo> but only for linux

[12:41] <jnthn> Travis gives Linux/OSX build feedback, AppVeyover gives Windows. They're per commit, so (unless we're all being really lazy :-)) a lot mroe often than nightly :)

[12:42] <jnthn> Well, per push, I guess :)

[13:39] <AlexDaniel_> rba: fwiw, I have a sakefile here (not committed to any repo yet) that makes rakudo releases locally. It does not do anything special though, but it's good to know that I can go through the release process sucessfully before the release day

[13:40] <AlexDaniel_> rba: nothing special = it's just a stresstest on roast HEAD and errata, some irrelevant release stuff, and a couple of other things

[13:41] <AlexDaniel_> I can upload pre-release tars somewhere if people want to

[14:34] <dogbert17> yay :-)

[14:34] <dogbert17> Zoffix also complained that t/spec/S32-io/lock.t hung but I suspect that the revert fixes that as well

[14:36] <jnthn> Yeah, the revert fixes it

[14:36] <jnthn> Though not pushing the revert

[14:36] <dogbert17> you want to figure it out I guess

[14:36] <jnthn> Yeah

[14:38] <dogbert17> running the IO test with RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG I get

[14:38] <dogbert17> ok 6 - \(:!non-blocking, :!shared), ""

[14:38] <dogbert17> 1..3

[14:38] <dogbert17> [SCHEDULER] Created initial affinity worker thread

[14:38] <dogbert17> [SCHEDULER] Supervisor started

[14:38] <dogbert17> [SCHEDULER] Supervisor thinks there are 4 CPU cores

[14:38] <dogbert17> [SCHEDULER] Created initial general worker thread

[14:38] <dogbert17> and then nothing ...

[14:44] <Zoffix> Hmm...

[14:44] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'start { sleep 2; exit }; "foo".IO.open.lock: :!shared;'

[14:44] <Zoffix> Could not obtain blocking, exclusive lock: Failed to lock filehandle: 9

[14:44] <Zoffix> I thought blocking blocked instead of failing :/

[14:45] <Zoffix> dogbert17: it's possible that hang is replicated by running this in one terminal `perl6 -e '"foo".IO.open(:w).lock; sleep'` and in the same dir in another terminal this: `perl6 -e 'start { sleep 2; exit }; "foo".IO.open.lock: :shared;'`  normally, the second code is meant to exit after 2 seconds

[14:46] <jnthn> It's odd, the program at least keeps doing *something*

[14:46] <jnthn> But not sure what

[14:46] <jnthn> All of the resizing logic is producing the output that I'd expect

[14:47] <jnthn> Oh, but it's the spawned process that hangs

[14:48] <jnthn> Not the parent one, which I guess is just waiting on it

[14:49] <jnthn> Oh heck, I think I know what might be going on

[14:50] <Zoffix> \o/

[14:50] <jnthn> So, in

[14:50] <jnthn> start { sleep 2; say ‘pass’; exit }; EVAL ‘say 1.0000001 ** (10 ** 8)’

[14:50] <jnthn> The start is now run on a thread with a tiny nursery. Probably I should make it a bit less tiny

[14:51] <jnthn> Anyway, somewhere on that thread's way to setting itself and its $*AWAITER up and so forth, it hits GC

[14:51] <jnthn> Before, because it had 4MB of space, it didn't every reach that point

[14:51] <jnthn> It then waits for the main thread to join in with GC

[14:52] <Zoffix> Ahh

[14:52] <jnthn> But...it won't. Why? 'cus it's busy doing the epic power

[14:52] <jnthn> Before it only passed because the thread had enough memory overhead

[14:52] <jnthn> And of course that bigint operation is written in C code

[14:52] <Zoffix> And in the S32-io/lock.t case: 'cus it's busy waiting for a lock

[14:52] <jnthn> So the usual "check if we need to GC at backbranches" thing doesn't happen

[14:52] <Zoffix> (on a filehandle)

[14:53] <jnthn> Yeah, but that lock really should be marking the thread blocked.

[14:53] <jnthn> Ah, it doesn't do that

[14:53] <jnthn> OK, so that lock/unlock is an easy fix, just make sure we mark the thread blocked while it does I/O

[14:54] <jnthn> The power one...well, same fix perhaps, but maybe we should consider how big the power is?

[14:54] <jnthn> Since the thread block/unblock costs something. Not a lot, but still

[20:40] <perlawhirl> error: redefinition of typedef ‘MVMJitCompiler’

[20:40] <perlawhirl> https://pastebin.com/Xansbjdy

[20:40] <perlawhirl> any ideas?

[20:41] <samcv> did you try a make realclean?

[20:41] <samcv> or make distclean

[21:23] <perlawhirl> i'll give it a shot

[21:41] <perlawhirl> hrm.... blew away my entire rakudo build... even building fresh clone of Moar by itself is failing

[21:42] <timotimo> wow

[21:42] <timotimo> that is actually wrong

[21:43] <timotimo> there's two identical typedefs for MVMJitCompiler

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 64b5dc03c4 | (Timo Paulssen)++ | src/types.h

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: remove duplicate typedef for MVMJitCompiler

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/64b5dc03c4

[21:43] <timotimo> perlawhirl: try now

[21:43] <perlawhirl> timotimo++
