[08:28] <samcv> oh you merged it huh

[09:13] <brrt> yes

[09:13] <brrt> it's a merge commit

[09:15] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[09:55] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[09:56] <brrt> in the continued spirit of rubberducking

[09:56] <brrt> i probably, nay, fairly surely, want to merge ARGLIST and CALL into a single node

[09:56] <brrt> well, that, or a single tile, at least

[09:57] <brrt> the simplest way to do that, would be to not output an ARGLIST tile at all

[09:57] <brrt> it's not necessary to be there

[09:57] <brrt> (the arglist can be indirectly gotten from the CALL, since the ARGLIST is the second parameter to the CALL

[10:01] <brrt> on the other hand....

[10:01] <brrt> we kind of do want to distinguish between refs of the CALL itself, and refs of the ARGLIST

[10:02] <brrt> because the second we have to issue a load for, after spilling, and the first we don't

[10:04] <brrt> the real issue at hand is that we need to make sure that all register shuffles etc. are inserted *after* the loads for the CALL arg

[10:10] <nine> When the same code handles the CALL and the ARGLIST, getting the order right is trivial, right?

[10:15] <brrt> yeah

[10:16] <jnthn> morning o/

[10:16] <brrt> well, loading the values before the CALL is done by insert_load_before_use, which uses the CALL as the reference tile, and the maximum order number of 1 (to mean 'just before the tile')

[10:17] <brrt> so i can start counting from 2 to order my new moves, and then i'll be good

[11:11] <jnthn> Adds the location on the C stack holding a variable pointing to a MoarVM object to the temporary root set

[11:12] <samcv> i'm gonna work on the ~~ m:i// problem rn

[11:12] <samcv> when does it need to be used?

[11:12] <jnthn> Whenever you have any GC-managed object in a C variable, and you call code that might enter the garbage collector

[11:13] <jnthn> Either by allocating a new object, blocking for I/O/sleep, or acquring a lock

[11:13] <samcv> kk

[11:16] <jnthn> I believe https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/547 is fixed, though seeing what Windows makes of the tests for that

[11:17] <jnthn> OK, it passes those

[11:28] <samcv> well I fixed that one RT, but broke all other matching with fc :P

[11:44] <brrt> i have a windows vm at home, but i couldn't get it to compile yesterday

[11:45] <jnthn> brrt: Sure, what'd you like me to try?

[11:45] <brrt> i want to see if i've wrapped the _BitScanForward intrinsic correctly

[11:46] <brrt> https://gist.github.com/bdw/92653ca6260e06167a1c703f95fd833b

[11:46] <brrt> whether that, if compiled with MSVC, gives you the (1-offset) number of the first bit set

[11:47] <brrt> e.g. in 0b100, it ought to give you '3', in 0b101, it ought to give you 0

[11:47] <brrt> eh

[11:47] <brrt> give you 1, in the last case

[11:47] <brrt> i need that for efficient conflict resolution using a bitmap

[11:48] <brrt> also, it will give me your ssh private keys, if that's no problem

[11:59] <samcv> and obviously that's past the length of the string so it's probably why it's not matching it. or at least part of the reason. idk where it gets 115 from

[12:13] <brrt> jnthn++ by the way

[12:18] <brrt> that said.

[12:18] <brrt> we could be using macro-based compiler feature detection, a lot more than we are now

[12:19] <brrt> that could potentially make MoarVM more easily crosscompileable

[12:39] <dogbert17_> jnthn: both RT's (125651, 128526) now generate exceptions instead of exiting silently

[12:42] <dogbert17_> also MoarVM 538 works better on Linux now, instead of a moarvm panic it now says 'caught exception X::AdHoc \n Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 3 \n no such file or directory'

[12:43] <dogbert17_> the RT's on the other hand only say Promise broken, why that happened isn't mentioned but perhaps that is the way it should be?

[13:04] <dogbert17_> uh oh

[13:05] <jnthn> We convey a decent error from MoarVM land at least

[13:05] <jnthn> Ah, this looks better

[13:06] <jnthn> For some reason we seem to ahve been duplicately .done/.quit-ing the stdout/stderr supplies too

[13:06] <jnthn> Which got filtered out, but still, it's waste

[13:06] <jnthn> Spectesing a rakudo patch now that should get the error in better shape

[13:31] <dogbert17_> oO

[13:32] <dogbert17_> we should let lizmat test your latest fix since that should improve harness6 (well at least a bit :-)

[13:34] <jnthn> Well, unfortunately the bug was in the mechanism I added to detect concurrent mis-use

[13:34] <lizmat> running with prove6 now, only got out of sequence errors in the uniprop test so far

[14:50] <timotimo> need to plug that in somewhere deep there

[14:50] <dogbert17_> I have run it three or four times already (i.e. spectest) in gdb. Not a single SEGV :(

[14:51] <timotimo> i hope my 9 gigs of storage are enough. it's already reached 1.2gigs before it started any spec tests

[14:52] <timotimo> nope, i better kill this and try it another way

[14:52] <dogbert17_> uh oh

[14:53] <timotimo> no biggie, i can just trace it to my external usb hard drive that's almost 1tb free space

[14:54] <timotimo> oh i forgot to set more test jobs this time

[14:57] <timotimo> OK, the external hard drive is set as the tracing target

[14:57] <timotimo> it'll be a bit slower, but at least it'll be enough space

[15:06] <dogbert17_> I got a SIGABORT, seems to be the bigint thingie

[15:10] <timotimo> t/spec/S04-statement-modifiers/with.rakudo.moar - failed 2 tests

[15:10] <timotimo> maybe i ought to update my rakudo before i try rr the next time

[15:10] <timotimo> for some reason it's stopped growing at 2.5gb

[15:11] <timotimo> i wonder if i can give jnthn a completed trace so he can inspect things? is that something that rr tries to do?

[15:11] <timotimo> make traces compatible across different machines?

[15:12] <timotimo> ah, still growing, but more slowly

[15:12] <dogbert17_> I wonder if I should have turned on jnthn's array debug support

[15:12] <timotimo> also, it doesn't seem like it's really doing multiple tests in parallel?

[15:12] <timotimo> okay, maybe a little bit

[15:13] <timotimo> but even though i have 8 test jobs, it's not maxing out my CPU

[15:19] <timotimo> emulates a single-core machine. So, parallel programs incur the slowdown of running on a single core. This is an inherent feature of the design.

[15:20] <timotimo> fair enough

[15:20] <jnthn> I wonder if I have access to anything I can run rr on...

[15:40] <jnthn> I believe that may be a separate issue; if it's in print-ruler or whatever it's called it may be spesh related

[15:41] <timotimo> i wonder how much smaller the trace would be if i threw out the jit ...

[15:41] <dogbert17_> so there are at least two issues left

[15:41] <timotimo> i've reached t/spec/integration!

[15:44] <jnthn> timotimo: given we want it to crash that's...not so promising :P

[15:44] <timotimo> yeah ;(

[15:44] <timotimo> doesn't it usually crash very late into the spec test?

[15:44] <jnthn> I've seen it anywhere

[15:44] <jnthn> Early, middle, late

[15:44] <timotimo> OK

[15:45] <jnthn> Mine just blew in S32

[15:45] <timotimo> is "tests out of sequence" a problem we want to look at?

[15:46] <jnthn> timotimo: I think IOninja was already looking in to that one

[15:46] <timotimo> ok, cool

[15:46] <timotimo> updating all my components now

[15:47] <jnthn> The object it's trying to GC is really an Int, not something we mixed in to

[15:47] <jnthn> So we can rule that part out

[15:48] <IOninja> timotimo: that's caused by https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130953#ticket-history

[15:48] <IOninja> timotimo: it's a release blocker and I don't know how to fix it. So... have at it? :)

[15:49] <timotimo> oh, damn

[15:52] <lizmat> jnthn: fwiw, 4 runs of prove6, no segfault seen yet

[15:53] <jnthn> lizmat: Lucky you, I get them almost every time

[15:53] <timotimo> "lucky" :)

[15:54] <lizmat> well, that means it just easier for you to debug  :-)

[15:55] <timotimo> oh! i had moarvm still with --optimize=0

[15:55] <timotimo> i wonder if that's a good idea

[16:01] <jnthn> I found one interesting thing examining the debug state

[16:01] <jnthn> Which is that we were doing the gen2 freeing *after* marking a thread back to blocked rather than stolen

[16:02] <jnthn> And that in theory means the thread could have started running again while another was freeing its gen2 still, and they'd race on the freelist

[16:02] <timotimo> that'd be very bad :)

[16:03] <jnthn> Done the simplest possible change to not do that

[16:04] <dogbert17_> is that change in master?

[16:04] <timotimo> clearly not yet

[16:04] <dogbert17_> :-)

[16:04] <jnthn> Just locally :)

[16:04] <jnthn> Trying if it even helps us get through one local run

[16:04] <jnthn> It still doesn't explain the rather spooky thing that everything we trip up on is an Int

[16:04] *** geekosaur joined
[16:05] <timotimo> yes, quite mysterious

[16:05] <jnthn> Run 1 passed

[16:05] <jnthn> But that's not enough to say anything

[16:06] <jnthn> (Passed as in no SEGV; require.t fails due to bustage, and there's the unicode-information issue that's not the thing we're hunting here)

[16:06] *** brrt joined
[16:07] <timotimo> i could run more than one rr in parallel!

[16:07] <timotimo> BBIAB

[16:10] <dogbert17_> so what you found was a bug but not necessarily the one we're after?

[16:11] <jnthn> dogbert17_: Too early to say

[16:12] <dogbert17_> I'll wait :)

[16:12] <timotimo> it is not advised to hold your breath at this time

[16:13] <jnthn> Doing a third run at the moment

[16:36] <jnthn> 5 completed harness6 runs now

[16:36] <dogbert17_> nice

[16:36] <jnthn> That's the most I've ever seen

[16:41] <dogbert17_> where is lizmat when we need her :)

[16:43] <jnthn> 6 fwiw :)

[16:45] <timotimo> 6 is a good number

[16:51] <jnthn> And the 7th was good too

[16:51] <jnthn> Once I get to 10 I think I'll be satisfied :)

[16:52] <jnthn> Especially if others can reproduce the improvement :)

[16:52] <timotimo> this fixes what kind of failure now? the bigint explosion?

[16:52] <jnthn> Yes

[16:53] <jnthn> Well, none all of the failure modes we were seeing have recurred for me so far

[16:54] <timotimo> that'd be pretty fantastic

[16:57] <jnthn> Currently on run 9

[16:58] <jnthn> Also may have a fix for another RT while was testing this out :)

[17:00] <timotimo> rr is causing some tests to fail it seems like ... but the harness doesn't crash yet

[17:00] <timotimo> of course it also takes quite a while to test all of this

[17:11] <jnthn> Yup, 10 runs without a SEGV

[17:12] <jnthn> Or any other kind of crash

[17:12] <jnthn> Jsut the tests out of sequene one and require.t failing

[19:23] <timotimo> oh, wait

[19:23] <timotimo> i tried to make it run as long as it doesn't crash

[19:23] <timotimo> but the tests also fail, so my script should have immediately exited?!

[19:23] <jnthn> heh :P

[19:23] <jnthn> scripting fail :P

[19:23] <timotimo> and of course my backscroll is only 1.8k lines

[19:23] <jnthn> aww

[19:24] <timotimo> in total, this day is one on which i'd like to flip every table in existence

[19:24] <timotimo> and every table thas has ever existed, and every table that might ever exist in the future

[19:25] * TimToady avoids tables today

[19:26] <timotimo> just imagine, carpenters in the future try building tables, but mysteriously they always end up flipped when they finish building them

[19:42] <moritz> leading to an agile carpentry revolution, where unfinished tables are shipped to the customer before they get a chance to flip

[19:44] <timotimo> yup

[19:44] <timotimo> there'll always be a hole for a screw, but no screw

[19:44] <timotimo> in every table around the world

[19:59] <TimToady> that's overkill, all they really have to do is ship all new tables upside-down, and then everything works out

[20:00] <TimToady> and we can ship all the old tables to Australia...

[20:49] <nwc10> (That's a good thing)

[20:50] <jnthn> :)

[20:50] * nwc10 hopes so too, because then it's a relatively small step to switching the default Rakudo harness to be 6

[20:50] <jnthn> Aye

[20:50] <nwc10> IIRC that gets you parallel testing on Windows

[20:50] <nwc10> er, "As I understand it"

[20:50] <jnthn> Hm, I should try it on Windows :)

[20:50] <IOninja> :)

[20:50] <nwc10> (I know why the Perl 5 harness can't do Windows)

[20:50] <nwc10> (in parallel)

[20:51] <jnthn> But yeah, in theory it should behave just the same on Windows

[20:52] <jnthn> My $dayjob app that used to be Proc::Async-heavy worked just as well on Windows as on Linux, at least :)

[21:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: samcv++ created pull request #548: Fix string_equal_at_ignore_case when string `a` changes length

[21:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/548

[21:38] <samcv> jnthn, let me know what you think of this PR. fixes the tests i have written using that op so at least all the ones i've written pass

[21:39] <samcv> if everything is fine, just tell me you approve and i'll merge it once spectest for roast comes back

[22:10] <jnthn> Hmm...not quite sure about exposing eqatic at an nqp:: op off hand

[22:11] <jnthn> 'cus the ic is "integer constant" meaning it's a kinda wierd op; you can only give it a literal offset iirc

[22:11] <jnthn> I'd probably declare the counter variable in the block where it's used

[22:13] <jnthn> I'm a tad nervous about the termination of that while loop

[22:13] <jnthn> (the one doing counter++)

[22:14] <jnthn> Oh, I guess we know that they differ

[22:15] <jnthn> Also, it doesn't MVMROOT a, but then accesses it

[22:16] <MasterDuke> jnthn: don't want to distract you too much, but while you're reviewing PRs, have you looked at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/546 ?

[22:18] * jnthn leaves comments

[22:18] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Will take a look, though getting tired...

[22:19] <MasterDuke> jnthn: no worries

[22:19] <samcv> jnthn, the ic isn't `ignore case`? what?

[22:20] <jnthn> Oh...

[22:20] <jnthn> Yes, it is :D

[22:20] <jnthn> hah

[22:20] <samcv> heh

[22:20] <jnthn> We did have an op that used ic for integer constant, I think :P

[22:22] <samcv> jnthn, i don't get this "the foldcase if it expands to can never start off with the same first codepoint"?

[22:22] <samcv> i mean if the firstn cp is diffrent then counter ends up being value 0

[22:22] <jnthn> Yes, what if the difference is at the end?

[22:23] <samcv> you mean the very end?

[22:23] <jnthn> if a is cccccC (where C is the codepoint that expands to 2 on foldcase)

[22:23] <samcv> well tests i wrote pass

[22:23] <jnthn> Then fca would become cccccXX (where XX is the expansion of C)

[22:23] <samcv> i will add some extra just to double check

[22:23] <samcv> yeah i understand that

[22:23] <jnthn> Well, XY

[22:23] <samcv> what i wrote works for that too

[22:24] <jnthn> Right, but it hinges on X != C

[22:24] <jnthn> Which I'm pretty sure always must be true

[22:24] <jnthn> But it's...not the most obvious loop termination condition :-)

[22:24] *** Ven joined
[22:24] <samcv> well it has to change, or else the length wouldn't change lol

[22:25] <jnthn> Yes, I agree it'd be very odd if a codepoint being foldcase'd expanded to itself + another char

[22:25] <jnthn> Because then fc(fc(x)) != fc(x)

[22:25] <jnthn> And I'm pretty sure that identify holds

[22:26] <jnthn> Anyway, I just get nervous about loops chugging through buffers where I don't immediately see why they terminate, is all :)

[22:26] <samcv> ah k

[22:26] <jnthn> I'm now convinced it's correct. It just wasn't obvious for a while *why* it was, so it may be worth a comment

[22:26] <samcv> yeah of course. totally understandable

[22:27] <samcv> and even if it did expand to itself + another, it would still end the loop

[22:27] <samcv> it would just be off by one

[22:27] <jnthn> Yes, but it'd be reading off the end of the buffer a then, potentially

[22:27] <jnthn> Which could lead to SEGV

[22:28] <samcv> i don't see why it'd be reading off the end, it would read up until they are different

[22:28] <jnthn> Were it possible.

[22:28] <samcv> yeah

[22:28] <jnthn> Yeah but fca is longer than a

[22:29] <samcv> oh i see what you're saying

[22:29] <samcv> :)

[22:29] <samcv> i will add an extra condition to make sure that can never happen

[22:30] <samcv> just to be safe

[22:32] <MasterDuke> jnthn: replied to your comment

[22:34] <samcv> jnthn, this patch is not perfect, but it should get us back to where we were before we changed it from lc to fc for certain characters
