[00:00] <samcv> does that work for you guys?

[01:37] <samcv> ugh starting to drive myself crazy with trying to debug collation

[18:23] <MasterDuke> is there a potential bug here? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/strings/ops.c#L426-L432

[18:24] <MasterDuke> i is an MVMint32, but an MVMString's num_graphs is an MVMuint32

[18:34] <geekosaur> there's so many such mismatches in the string/char code in moarvm that I have to assume it's de facto safe

[18:34] <geekosaur> you mostly can't trigger the edge conditions anyway :)

[18:39] <MasterDuke> i think `perl6 -e 'my $a = "a" x 2**32-1; say $a.chars; my $b = $a.substr(1); say $b.chars'` will trigger it, but it needs 17gb ram (hence my question in #perl6)

[20:20] <samcv> MasterDuke, ideally we will use collapse_strands() instead of repeating the word inside all the different functions that need to collapse strands

[20:21] <samcv> so looks like that is a place we can remove that code and just call collapse_strands()

[21:55] <samcv> MasterDuke, i'm working on making it so that and collapse_strands can both share the same loop

[21:56] <samcv> since all they do is iterate a grapheme iterator until the end. even though one is copying the whole string and one a substring

[22:27] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[22:27] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Move the code from collapse_strands() into iterate_gi_into_string(). This

[22:27] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: allows us to use it in MVM_string_substring() and both reduce code duplication

[22:27] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: and also use more optimized code.

[23:27] <samcv> \o/ now passing tests 1 through 18888 with my collation_arrays branch

[23:27] <samcv> (unicode collation test)

[23:30] <samcv> ok out of all the tests (190,412 total tests) failing only 699 now \o/
