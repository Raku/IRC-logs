[00:06] <timotimo> welp, i wrote a template for gethow but i got the jit to panic with "no inbound edge"

[00:08] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/e7f7088cd82e2f7322b474fe59d10a84 - brrt can have a look at this to see what i messed up :)

[00:09] <timotimo> oh, maybe there was a real reason to have ptr_sz as the return value for call ... :)

[00:09] <timotimo> nope. that didn't actually fix it

[00:20] <timotimo> i was able to build "iter" without a crash, but only as a super simple c function call

[00:23] <timotimo> huh, i still get "cannot get template for iter" messages in the jit log though

[00:31] <timotimo> i put the iter function up in that gist, too, for good measure

[00:31] <timotimo> bedtime

[00:32] <MasterDuke> i was thinking about trying some of those really simple *_i  ones

[00:32] <yoleaux> 18 May 2017 06:01Z <brrt> MasterDuke: yes; i think there's a parser bug somewhere in there which means you need to have an extra newline after the last template

[00:34] <MasterDuke> timotimo: how do you get that log?

[00:36] <timotimo> MVM_JIT_LOG

[00:37] <timotimo> grep "tree out of" /tmp/coresettingjitlog.txt  | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | less    - gives you what chunks of mvm ops it turns into expression trees

[00:37] <timotimo> grep "get template for" /tmp/coresettingjitlog.txt    | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | less    - gives you the mvm ops that terminate individual exprjit attempts

[00:38] <MasterDuke> cool, thanks

[00:39] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/2b25fca488f179a29c9a555863343d78   - the thing at the top gives you the scoreboard based on the "tree out of" lines

[00:40] <MasterDuke> i don't know what expression trees are

[00:42] <timotimo> well, the major leap forward that the exprjit (aka even-moar-jit, aka the new jit) has over the current jit is that it creates a close-to-assembly datastructure from multiple mvm ops in a row

[00:42] <timotimo> the jit before that would immediately spit out a piece of machine code for every mvm op it finds and then it'll be done with it

[00:43] <timotimo> that forced us to have a load for every argument and a store for the written registers around every op

[00:44] <timotimo> the exprjit has a low-level representation of things that get created from mvm ops and then a register allocator runs through it; that's the most basic benefit we get from the exprjit

[00:44] <timotimo> the next step is that REPRs can have their own implementations of their reprops written in expr templates

[00:44] <timotimo> the effect of that is much like inlining function calls

[00:45] <MasterDuke> ah, nice

[00:45] <timotimo> the previous jit was able to emit a direct call to a specific repr's reprop if the type of object was known at jit time

[00:45] <timotimo> but even then the call was still opaque and presented a barrier in terms of optimization

[00:46] <timotimo> with the exprjit we could get common subexpression elimination across multiple calls to the same reprop, for example

[00:47] <MasterDuke> immediately subsequent calls?

[00:47] <timotimo> another thing is that the VMArray repr has a big switch/case in many of its reprops to do the right thing based on the type of slot that the type has

[00:47] <timotimo> well, like nqp::push_o($a, 1); nqp::push_o($a, 2); nqp::push_o($a, 3)

[00:49] <timotimo> the pieces of dump in the jitlog that start with "digraph {", you can feed to graphviz, for example by piping/pasting it into "dot -Tx11"

[00:50] <timotimo> the tile list log is, if i understand correctly, closer to the metal, i.e. already linearized

[00:50] <MasterDuke> the new jit could just do the right branch of those ops?

[00:50] <timotimo> yup, but of course it requires these reprops to be implemented once in C and once in expr tree language

[00:51] <MasterDuke> each branch as a separate c function?

[00:51] <timotimo> no

[00:51] <timotimo> the C portion would be kept as is

[00:52] <MasterDuke> oh, nice

[00:52] <timotimo> ok, i'm off

[00:52] <timotimo> have a good one :)

[00:53] <MasterDuke> likewise

[00:55] <timotimo> don't forget to look into unsafe.expr where brrt collected some templates that cause some kind of breakage

[00:55] <MasterDuke> i wondered what that was

[01:38] * Zoffix wonders if tools/contributors.p6 is buggy

[01:39] <Zoffix> timotimo: says you made just 2 commits this month. Does that sound right? I thought there were all the telemeh stuff

[20:54] <jnthn> Yeah, we do :)

[20:54] <jnthn> And you've done a chunk of the work to fix it, it turns out ;)

[20:55] <timotimo> that's nice, i can look into the rest of that soon

[20:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 9c1762636c | (Jonathan Worthington)++ | docs/ChangeLog

[20:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Mention spesh position info is used for coverage.

[20:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9c1762636c

[20:55] <jnthn> Cool :)

[20:55] <jnthn> timotimo++

[20:56] <jnthn> Anything else, or shall I go for release?

[20:57] <timotimo> we could already merge the mutex for parameterization

[20:57] <timotimo> so we can at least not get the segv in that spec test

[20:57] <Zoffix> If the bug disappears with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE does it mean it's somewhere in src/spesh/ code?

[20:57] <timotimo> not necessarily

[20:57] <Zoffix> ok

[20:57] <timotimo> it could also be a bug in the jit

[20:57] <timotimo> because when you disable spesh, it'll turn off the jit, too

[20:58] <Zoffix> MVM_JIT_DISABLE doesn't remove the bug tho

[20:58] <Zoffix> m: sub rotr(uint32 $n, uint32 $b) { $n +> $b +| $n +< (32 - $b) }; say rotr 1652322944, 18; my $x; for ^1000 { $x = rotr 1652322944, 18 }; say $x

[20:58] <Zoffix> ^ that bug

[20:58] <timotimo> it might have something to do with inline or osr

[20:58] <Zoffix> hm

[20:58] <timotimo> so you can check those separately, too

[20:59] <Zoffix> yeah, OSR = still bug; INLINE = no bug

[20:59] <timotimo> cool.

[20:59] <timotimo> also: oh no

[20:59] <jnthn> That gets it down to inlining then :S

[21:00] <timotimo> we're not handling stuff like unsignedness across inlines?

[21:00] <timotimo> we should just be memcpy-ing flags around, though

[21:00] <jnthn> Yeah, not sure it'd need special handling

[21:01] <jnthn> I wonder if it's the inlining of rotr itself, of the inlining of things inside of rotr

[21:02] <jnthn> m: sub rotr(uint32 $n, uint32 $b) { my $ignore = nqp::ctx(); $n +> $b +| $n +< (32 - $b) }; say rotr 1652322944, 18; my $x; for ^1000 { $x = rotr 1652322944, 18 }; say $x

[21:07] <Zoffix> Something with the 32 size?

[21:08] <jnthn> Certainly the program relies on promotion from 32-bit to get the correct result

[21:09] <jnthn> Though we're meant to do computation in 64-bit wide and then nothing should be narrowing it again in this code

[21:11] <jnthn> Doesn't seem keen to be golfed further...

[21:16] <Zoffix> jnthn: not really, I have a workaround for it by undoing a bug fix

[21:17] <Zoffix> Basically putting back this bug: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126942

[21:17] <Zoffix> (which we already had in last releease)

[21:17] <Zoffix> Oh wait, I mean this one: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131278

[21:17] <Zoffix> m: my $i = -0x8000000000000000; say ($i div 2**23) == ($i +> 23) ?? 'good' !! 'bad';

[21:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7c23a: OUTPUT: «good␤»

[21:18] <Zoffix> Oh right. Well, the undoing will make the last two say bad

[21:40] <jnthn> Zoffix: Would you prefer to wait and see if I can fix it tomorrow, or should I go ahead with the release?

[21:41] <Zoffix> jnthn: up to you. I'm leaning towards release now.

[21:42] <jnthn> OK. I don't think this is a MoarVM regression, rather than something streamlined code in Rakudo has exposed.

[21:42] <jnthn> Totally agree it wants fixing.

[21:43] <jnthn> But it's probably better to put in a carefully considered fix for an inlining related bug than try and rush one in.

[21:43] <jnthn> That code is...complex.
