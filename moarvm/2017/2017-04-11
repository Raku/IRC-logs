[00:49] <timotimo> oh, the "attempted to unlock a mutex by a thread not holding it" or whatever was from when i added a new op and forgot ot recompile rakudo ... i think?

[00:49] <timotimo> or when i did the reverse; threw away the changes and forgot to recompile rakudo

[00:50] <timotimo> Please report this as a bug (mail to [email@hidden.address]
[00:50] <timotimo> and re-run with the --ll-exception command line option

[00:50] <timotimo> to get more information about your error>

[00:50] <timotimo> where is this coming from? o_O

[00:50] <timotimo> Backtrace.pm, eh? huh.

[07:33] <yoleaux> 25 Mar 2017 07:50Z <samcv> nine: getting those failing tests again. maybe because i'm using libffi under moarvm and not dyncall?

[07:33] <yoleaux> 30 Mar 2017 03:59Z <AlexDaniel> nine: any ideas? https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-03-30#i_14348415

[07:34] <samcv> that was a while ago. hm

[07:34] <nine> Oops... Shouldn't I have gotten these on #perl6-dev, too?

[07:35] <samcv> probably

[07:37] <samcv> anyway i have not 100% confirmed the abovee, but that's what i suspect the issue may be

[07:38] *** domidumont joined
[07:58] <nine> Well dyncall is certainly the better tested one.

[08:24] <brrt> good *, #moarvm

[08:24] <brrt> ohai nine

[08:24] <brrt> lol 'giving less focus on top committer stats'

[08:25] <brrt> well, if you're open source community is so screwed that people regard it as a points-gathering exercise...

[08:25] <brrt> *your

[08:27] <samcv> hi brrt

[08:28] <brrt> hi samcv

[08:33] <samcv> that's a good article

[08:34] <samcv> i need to invent one of those watches that counts your steps or something except it tracks your points

[08:34] <samcv> and it will make exciting noisese when you gain points

[08:37] <samcv> also soon we will have coverage reports with every commit i expect

[08:37] <samcv> since i've now learned how to get travis ci to make commits to repositories

[08:37] <samcv> and we will have a github pages page which will have the coverage infos

[08:38] <brrt> it's a decent article, but I can't help but grumble like an old fart about theâ€¦ assumingness of it all

[08:38] <brrt> i'm not sure how to say it correctly

[08:38] <samcv> i think I get what you mean

[08:39] <brrt> well, that's better than I could expect :-)

[08:40] <brrt> that said

[08:40] <brrt> how is your experience as a new contributor for moar / rakudo?

[08:40] <brrt> i do wonder

[08:42] <samcv> good

[08:42] <samcv> it makes me very happy

[08:53] <samcv> to be improving a language I love for all the people that use it

[08:53] <samcv> is very satisfying

[09:47] *** brrt joined
[09:48] <brrt> well, that's good to hear :-)

[09:48] <nine> brrt: the article does mention that it is written with a kernel focus

[09:52] <brrt> oh, i didn't notice tha

[09:54] <nine> brrt: s/better of re-engineering/better off re-engineering/ in your latest blog post

[09:55] <nine> And very interesting bit about setjmp/longjmp :)

[09:58] <brrt> i'll fix it, thanks :-)

[10:05] <nine> brrt: hahaha, that's cool. Just reading your Register Allocator Update blog post and when I came to the paragraph about squeezing in new tiles into the tile array, I though "couldn't you just leave some space between the tiles?". And that seems to be exactly what you did :)

[10:21] *** stmuk joined
[10:26] <brrt> yes, it is :-)

[11:23] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:23] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: mp_get_long_long does in fact overflow/wrap around when the mp_int is

[11:23] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: too large. So bring back checking the number of bits in the mp_int

[11:23] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: before calling it. Also, remove the redundant check for whether the

[11:23] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: mp_int is 0, since the exact same check is done in mp_get_long_long.
