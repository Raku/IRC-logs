[04:11] <samcv> ok so there we some travis builds that had been attempted to not build for os x as per the .travis.yml but now that i fixed the file, we get two less os x builds

[04:11] <samcv> but it seems the intent of what was written in the file was to disable them

[04:13] <samcv> CC=gcc && CC=clang with no options. don't see why those should not build on os x. so probably should remove those lines

[04:15] <samcv> err actually it was --no-jit CC=gcc and no options + CC=gcc # these were listed to be excluded in the matrix but they've been building for as long as i've been watchingh the project

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage: Comment out some more MacOS lines that may have been unintentional

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage:

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage: These have been building on MacOS for a very long time, and although

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage: there were exclusions listed in .travis.yml, they were not exactly identical

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage: to the matrix above it, so they were not excluded.

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage:

[04:17] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/coverage: Comment them out, I see no reason why they cannot be tested as they have been.

[21:31] <samcv> telemeh_try heh

[21:31] <samcv> is that something that already existed i didn't know about

[21:34] <timotimo> telemetry is a professional product. it's very good and very expensive

[21:35] <timotimo> its main strength is that it's has so little performance impact that you can just leave it in your code for production purposes, and that it has a very powerful viewer for the data

[21:36] <samcv> nice

[21:37] <timotimo> i've never used it, but i did look at their sales page

[21:38] <samcv> what. is that a joke

[21:39] <samcv> also telemeh try is only one character away from telemetry. you can't fool me!

[21:43] <timotimo> no joke

[21:43] <timotimo> http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm - sai dpage

[21:43] <timotimo> â€¦

[21:43] <timotimo> typing: not very.
