[00:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Make string_index 16% faster for incompatible string types

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: For incompatible string types use string_equal_at_ignore_case_INTERNAL_loop

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: which results in a 16% speed boost. Only a minor change to the INTERNAL_loop

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: function and it works flawlessly for nonignorecase/ignoremark functionality.

[15:49] <yoleaux> I saw jnthn 9 Jul 2017 22:52Z in #perl6-dev: <jnthn> Sleep time; 'night o/

[15:50] <Zoffix> <jnthn> btw, mentioned it on #moarvm on Friday, but to note here: I'm off on a short vacation tomorrow morning, so probably won't be on IRC again until Wednesday or so.

[15:51] * lizmat hopes Zoffix will enjoy

[15:52] <Zoffix> I was quoting what jnthn said

[15:52] * Zoffix steals jnthn's vacation and enjoys it

[21:47] <MasterDuke> i mentioned this in #perl6-dev yesterday and made the changes requested, anybody have an objection to someone merging https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/590 ?

[23:13] <samcv> good *

[23:13] <yoleaux> 18:34Z <Zoffix> samcv: can all the TODOs in t/spec/S15-nfg/emoji-test.t now be unfudged?

[23:16] <samcv> lizmat, you didn't add that we now parse all Emoji v4.0 as single characters and the MoarVM Readme has been updated to show full unicode 9.0 support

[23:17] <samcv> also regex is 16% faster when doing it between an 8bit and 32 bit string representations for moarvm

[23:19] <samcv> and one more thing. one sec lemme get the speed diff

[23:20] <samcv> 6% speed improvement slurping files with lots of unicode

[23:22] <samcv> no actually make that 9% ran test a few more times and did the shortest time for each
