[06:03] <brrt> brain is not producing any inspiration for the JIT today...

[06:05] *** domidumont joined
[06:10] <brrt> let's see where we were

[06:10] <brrt> i've added the opr_kind to the JIT expr info

[06:10] <brrt> (so to the 'metadata' nodes)

[06:11] <brrt> happily, those are 0 if not defined

[06:11] <brrt> saves me a bug of difficulty

[06:13] <brrt> that wasn't grammar

[06:13] <brrt> anyway

[06:14] <brrt> what i need to do now is associate them with the live ranges

[06:14] <brrt> the thing after that is to have a 'type' specific memroy-location allocator

[06:48] *** brrt joined
[06:55] *** domidumont joined
[07:40] *** sivoais joined
[07:52] <brrt> the association with live ranges is where my brain is drying up

[07:52] <brrt> so lets try and figure that out

[07:52] <brrt> - if something is 'basic', then obviously, the type of the value is the same as the type of the node it represents

[07:53] <brrt> - if a copy of some sort (DO/COPY pseudotile), then..

[07:54] <brrt> - either the copied value has a type and the DO/COPY does not, in which case nothing changes

[08:03] <brrt> - or the DO/COPY has some value, and the copied value has not, in which case we assign the copied values' type

[08:04] <brrt> - or they both have a value and it agrees, in which case we're ok

[08:04] <brrt> -or it doesn't agree

[08:04] <brrt> the same thing is kind of true of IF / PHI nodes

[08:09] <samcv> i know that feeling about not as much inspiration :P

[08:09] <samcv> you seem to be working with it though :)

[08:12] <brrt> :-)

[08:12] <brrt> so there's another thing i didn't think of...

[08:12] <brrt> if we load a value directly from a local, it should kind of agree with the local types map

[08:13] <brrt> and indeed, set and getlex don't have a type, i think

[08:19] <brrt> okay, in that case, we kind of want to use the local_types map

[08:46] <lizmat> https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/6hagwm/performance_concern_with_respect_to_gnu_yes/   # wonder how Perl 6 is doing after jnthn's latest refactoring

[08:53] <jnthn> morning #moarvm

[08:55] <jnthn> lizmat: Haven't looked much at output yet, though it's certainly not anything like so speedy as it could be

[09:01] <samcv> yeah it does seem a bit slow lizmat

[09:01] <samcv> hm

[09:02] <samcv> not as slow as they show

[09:02] <samcv> getting 250-280KiB/s

[09:03] <jnthn> But anyway, yes output has gotten slower, 'cus it calls .encode, which normalizes the encoding every time through and so forth

[09:03] <samcv> i can get 3.4MB using nqp::say

[09:04] <samcv> if i set it to a variable i get way faster speeds

[09:04] <samcv> hmm now it went down

[09:05] <samcv> hmm looks like a fluk? idk i got 3 mb on perl 6 code and now it's back to what it was at before only a tiny bit faster

[09:06] <samcv> jnthn, any way to cache it on the user code side?

[09:10] <samcv> i can go from 270 to 380KB/s by doing $*OUT.open

[09:19] <jnthn> huh, I don't know how $*OUT.open would change anything :S

[09:20] *** zakharyas joined
[09:44] <jnthn> Urgh. So it turns out that actually coping with deopt during args processing is even trickier as we need to recreate the args processing context

[09:45] <jnthn> Uh, in the inline case I mean

[09:45] <jnthn> But it also turns out that my "did we deopt" check was wrong too (it checked everywhere, not just in the args processing region)

[09:54] <jnthn> This is especially good in that it means I can do a much simpler and far more localized change and get the inlining I was hoping for, rather than a bunch of wider-ranging and delicate chances.

[09:54] <jnthn> *changes

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Correct deopt check when removing named arg marks.

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: We only care about whether there is a deopt point during argument

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: processing. If there isn't, we can safely strip out the tracking.

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: It's only when there is that we must leave the tracking in place,

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: which in turn prevents inlining. Previously we tracked it there

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: was a deopt anywhere in the routine, rather than just up to the

[10:03] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: end of argument processing.

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ebe2bb0b38

[10:04] <jnthn> Another couple of percent from that inlining.

[10:04] <jnthn> Not quite so much as I'd hoped, but still

[10:13] *** brrt joined
[10:43] <jnthn> Currently I've reached the point where things are faster than before the I/O refactors in my for/lines thing

[10:44] <jnthn> But many of the opts should help more generally

[10:52] <eveo> awesome

[11:57] <dogbert17> jnthn++ optimizations

[12:20] *** colomon joined
[12:21] * jnthn back

[12:22] <jnthn> So, how shall I optimize this thing next...

[12:23] <dogbert17> does callgrind show anything in need of opts?

[12:24] <[Coke]> Are you still opting the char counter?

[12:25] <jnthn> [Coke]: Yes, except mostly what I've been finding so far has just been poor code-gen or poor spesh

[12:26] <jnthn> [Coke]: Meaning the fixes should have implications far beyond that

[12:26] <[Coke]> Would it be worthwhile to add a short "here's how I optimized this, and so can you." doc?

[12:26] <[Coke]> jnthn++

[12:27] <jnthn> I'm not sure, in that most of the fixes are deep in code-gen or the specializer

[12:28] <jnthn> I'll certainly blog about what I've done

[12:28] <jnthn> And if there's anything generally useful I'm fine with it being lifted into the docs

[12:28] <[Coke]> jnthn++ again. :)

[12:29] <jnthn> So, what to optimize next...

[12:29] * jnthn has 3 things that all need work

[12:30] * lizmat volunteers as tie-breaker

[12:30] <jnthn> Well, it's either doing the long-planned code-gen improvements for statementlist `for`, looking into utf-8 decoding, and looking into separator hunting

[12:31] <dogbert17> are they equally difficult you think?

[12:32] <jnthn> Well, the `for` one I already know what to do up front :)

[12:32] <jnthn> Though I know that when I do it, people will ask me to do the same but for more cases of it :P

[12:32] <lizmat> perhaps then you won't need to do it yourself ?

[12:32] <jnthn> Possibly :)

[12:33] <jnthn> The idea is to have statementlist `for` compile into code that does a while loop that calls pull-one

[12:33] <jnthn> Rather than go through sink-all

[12:33] <jnthn> In simple cases. :)

[12:34] <jnthn> The upshot of this is that we will typically end up with a monomorphic callsite at the pull-one rather than a megamorphic one

[12:34] <dogbert17> why not start with that one then, perhaps it can make to the next MoarVM release

[12:34] <jnthn> Well, it's in Rakudo :)

[12:34] <jnthn> But yeah

[12:34] <dogbert17> *make it*

[12:35] * jnthn digs in

[12:35] <dogbert17> lizmat: wasn't there some opt regarding map and grep which had to be removed because of some phaser problem a couple of months ago?

[12:36] <lizmat> well, we still need an extra scope every now and then

[12:37] <dogbert17> it was a noticable change (at least in some of my code)

[12:37] <lizmat> ah, grep you mean, with redo and stuff

[12:47] <dogbert17> yeah, that was it

[13:07] *** zakharyas joined
[13:07] <eveo> I did some digging for that reddit perf question and wrote a detailed answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/6hagwm/performance_concern_with_respect_to_gnu_yes/dixps6s/

[13:08] <eveo> Looks like 50% of performance loss is actually in loop {}

[13:12] <lizmat> I guess we need an opt that turns loop { } into postfix while 1  :-)

[13:14] <jnthn> Or actually look at the generated code and figure out what's different :)

[13:15] <eveo> Phaser support?

[13:15] <eveo> Which I'm assuming can be statically checked or something

[13:15] * eveo &

[13:33] *** colomon joined
[14:37] <jnthn> Well, seems I've got the better for code-gen for the simple loop case working

[14:37] <eveo> \o/

[14:37] <jnthn> Alas, spesh needs teaching to make the most of the new opportunities still.

[14:38] <jnthn> But it's some more percent off at least :)

[14:40] <jnthn> argh wat, suddenly new spectest failure after I fixed the only one I had left failing :/

[15:02] <lizmat> jnthn: param_rp_s   what could be the cause of that ?

[15:03] <lizmat> it's preventing &DYNAMIC from getting JITted

[15:05] <jnthn> Means something didn't work out when it was trying to specialized something that takes a required positional string parameter

[15:06] <jnthn> Though I don't know why the _s 'cus DYNAMIC is declared as \name

[15:06] <lizmat> yeah, oops, that was after something I changed

[15:06] <lizmat> turns out otherwise the JIT is being blocked by getlexreldyn

[15:07] <jnthn> That one is probably fixable

[15:08] <lizmat> then DYNAMIC could be JITted and loops with .say would be faster still  :-)

[15:56] <jnthn> argh, and it breaks one spectest :/

[22:01] <dogbert17> hi, have a doc question for you

[22:02] <dogbert17> do you think it would be ok to move the utf-c8 description from https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/strings/utf8_c8.c#L3 to you unicode document?

[22:02] <dogbert17> I'm no expert on unicode perhaps something more is needed?

[22:02] <samcv> like docs.perl6.org?

[22:03] <dogbert17> yeah, here's the issue: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/strings/utf8_c8.c#L3
