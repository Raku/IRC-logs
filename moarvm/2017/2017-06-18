[00:08] <samcv> jnthn, getting a segfault

[00:08] <samcv> not using any async things. just Proc

[00:08] <samcv> and no concurrency

[00:10] <samcv> https://gist.github.com/9f7d8820cb9e56d14abecd9aaf88b6e2

[00:11] <samcv> it's using my Font::QueryInfo module. which just uses run

[00:11] <samcv> crashes 100% of the time after like the exact number of seconds of runtme

[00:12] <eveo> Proc uses async things

[00:12] <samcv> yes

[00:12] <eveo> buggable: eco Font::QueryInfo

[00:12] <buggable> eveo, Font::QueryInfo 'blah blah blah': https://github.com/samcv/perl6-Font-QueryInfo

[00:13] <samcv> but i am not using any of the perl6 concurrency features that is. no start blocks. and just run's to launch the process

[00:13] <samcv> run the example and point it to one of your /usr/share/fonts/something folder

[00:13] <samcv> that has a fair number of fonts in it

[00:14] <samcv> crashes after about 3.6 seconds for me

[00:14] <samcv> with pretty extreme accuracy. 3.6s or 3.7 seconds it segfaults

[00:15] <eveo> like where? It keeps telling there are no fonts

[00:15] <eveo> nm

[00:15] <samcv> what folders do you have in /usr/share/fonts ?

[00:16] <samcv> just pick some folder that has enough fonts for it to run long enough i guess. i picked my noto folder. but also happens in a folder of all the microsoft office fonts

[00:16] <eveo> finishes fine after 11s

[00:19] <samcv> 2017.04.3 works fine for me. i'm building 2017.05 to check. but i don't remember it segfaulting ever when i wrote the module a few days ago

[00:35] <samcv> eveo, 2017.05 doesn't segfault

[00:36] <samcv> hmm maybe it's i built with debug =3?

[00:36] <samcv> rakudobrew built perl6 doesn't segfault either

[00:36] <samcv> this is odd

[00:37] <samcv> eveo, yep it seems rebuilding without debugging causes no segfault

[00:45] <eveo> *phew*

[20:20] <brrt> \o

[20:20] <brrt> it is soo warm, warm, warm

[20:22] <jnthn> Today was OK here, but it's about to become less OK in the next days :S

[20:22] <brrt> well, we're ahead by a day i guess

[20:33] *** domidumont joined
[20:34] <lizmat> reached 29 here today

[20:34] <lizmat> (really ;-)

[20:35] <brrt> well, i reached 29 in march :-P

[20:36] <lizmat> well, in about 3 years I'll reach 40  :-)

[20:37] <jnthn> Set for 29 tomorrow and 32 on Tuesday

[20:38] <jnthn> As if working on spesh wasn't brain-melting enough :P

[20:41] <geekosaur> 30 here now which is a bit higher than expected, but the next week is expected to be cooler than the last (which sounds like what you're headed into except I think it takes a bit longer to cross the pond :)

[20:41] <brrt> yeah, mch the same here

[20:47] <brrt> pro tip

[20:47] <brrt> lacking an air conditioner, a fan + a plate of water will help

[20:47] <jnthn> I have the fan but...didn't think of the plate of water

[20:47] <geekosaur> swamp cooler!

[20:47] <jnthn> Where should it be placed in relation to the fan for best effect? :)

[20:48] <lizmat> fwiw, washing my hands and wetting my wrists with cold water, helps me a lot when working on a hot keyboard

[20:49] <brrt> oh, that too

[20:49] <brrt> ehm, i've placed mine in front

[20:49] <brrt> it's not a huge difference like an AC would have, but still

[20:53] <timotimo> i've heard of draping a wet towel over the cage of the fan

[20:56] <brrt> that's possible too, it's really the same principle

[20:57] <brrt> evaporation takes out heat from the air

[20:57] <brrt> ice works better still

[20:57] <brrt> because the heat of melting + the heat of evaporations is really quite substantial

[20:59] <timotimo> i see

[20:59] <timotimo> we do have ice cubes :)

[21:00] <timotimo> you know these plastic bags that contain a whole bunch of little ball-shaped containers?

[21:00] <brrt> no

[21:00] <timotimo> and they self-seal when you fill 'em up?

[21:00] <brrt> but, i do have a very similar thing with tube-shaped containers

[21:00] <timotimo> ah, i've seen that kind

[21:00] <timotimo> anyway, you can break out individual ice balls out of this

[21:05] <brrt> uhuh

[21:20] <timotimo> it's "cool"

[21:28] <jnthn> Time for me to rest up a bit for the week ahead :)

[21:29] <jnthn> 'night o/

[21:30] <timotimo> o/

[21:32] <lizmat> night jnthn

[21:41] <brrt> sleep well

[22:00] *** brrt joined
[22:01] <timotimo> we just had a commit that turned away str in a signature and turned it into Str to make things jit for a pretty big improvement

[22:01] <timotimo> hopefully the new jit will allow us to jit these kinds of parameters, too

[22:01] <timotimo> it's the boxing that's sometimes necessary that makes it hard, right?

[22:03] <timotimo> oh, or is it the return type being a struct?
