[12:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo: what's the name of your string nursery adjusting branch?

[12:34] <timotimo> adjust_nursery_stringops

[12:35] <MasterDuke> thanks

[12:46] <MasterDuke> fyi, looks like it doesn't merge cleanly with master at HEAD

[12:47] <timotimo> yeah, sam is working in the same file

[13:29] <MasterDuke> just tried that code sample from mr_ron (`for (50_000, 100_000) -> $limit {my $x; my $y = "x" x 100; $x ~= $y for (1..$limit); say "$limit: ", now - ENTER now}`) with and without your branch

[13:30] <MasterDuke> timotimo: ^^^

[13:43] <timotimo> that looks like an improvement

[13:52] <MasterDuke> i'd say so

[20:52] <samcv> good *

[21:01] <samcv> well i just added my first note to a commit and pushed it

[21:01] <samcv> neat

[21:01] <samcv> github doesn't seem to show it though :|

[21:01] <timotimo> i'm not sure git notes and github comments are the same thing or even compatible at all?

[21:02] <timotimo> (and i have never use dgit notes before %) )

[21:02] <timotimo> BBIAB

[21:02] <samcv> they are not the same

[21:02] <samcv> i did  git notes add 0729f841

[21:02] <samcv> added my note. i can see it in git log. then i did git push refs/notes/commits

[21:03] <samcv> it doesn't get pushed by default with refs/master or whatever it is

[21:03] <samcv> timotimo, if you try and pull can you see my note on 0729f841

[21:03] <samcv> which is the latest commit

[21:46] <timotimo> i don't see it :(

[21:46] <timotimo> error: No note found for object 0729f8411b6d787b4e6ccba089046dfb801fd968.

[21:57] <samcv> can you try pulling /refs/notes/commits

[21:58] <samcv> err refs/notes/commits

[22:30] *** lizmat joined
[23:00] <timotimo> i don't think that's a thing you can pull from?

[23:00] <timotimo> i think that's where things get stored to locally?

[23:00] *** lizmat joined
[23:22] <samcv> timotimo, hmm i can do git fetch origin refs/notes/commits

[23:22] <samcv> but if i try to pull then it gives me an error

[23:25] <timotimo> oh

[23:26] <samcv> i'm so confused though

[23:26] <samcv> in general

[23:26] <samcv> about how to push and pull notes

[23:27] <jnthn> Hm, they're doing it using the refs thing?

[23:28] <samcv> yeah

[23:28] *** deep-book-gk_ joined
[23:28] <jnthn> Does fetch instead of pull work out?

[23:29] <jnthn> pull = fetch + merge, but if it's not a commit object being fetched then I suspect it confuses the merge step

[23:30] *** deep-book-gk_ left
[23:38] <samcv> fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

[23:38] <samcv> i'm sure i'm doing this wrong

[23:40] <timotimo> yeah, that's the pull == fetch + merge thing

[23:42] <geekosaur> right, just do fetch not merge

[23:42] <geekosaur> er, not pull

[23:47] <samcv> i did do fetch though

[23:47] <geekosaur> then I'd expect the note to be there, provided you also pulled the object it's attached to (that is in the normal repo not refs/notes)

[23:48] <geekosaur> ...that might require git fetch --tags or some such

[23:51] <samcv> ok to fetch notes

[23:51] <samcv> git fetch origin 'refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*'

[23:52] <samcv> why can't it just get them automatically and make everybodies life easier
