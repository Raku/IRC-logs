[09:25] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[09:25] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: With slots it is because they are unpredictable in the face of

[09:49] <timotimo> it's only the jit latency if you consider the code on the gpu to be the target, which i'd claim it isn't

[09:51] <timotimo> because it's the gpu driver that takes ages to turn the glsl (or hlsl on directx) into whatever internal machine-code-like stuff the gpu uses

[09:53] <ilmari> they have to JIT the TEV config to glsl first

[09:53] <timotimo> right, but that's probably the faster step; i might have to re-read

[11:05] <lizmat> jnthn: possibly related to this, do you have a clue why "is default()" is not honoured on attributes ?

[11:06] <jnthn> lizmat: No, no idea why that'd be

[11:06] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a is default(42) }; use nqp; dd nqp::getattr(nqp::create(A),A,q/$!a/)

[11:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e078d: OUTPUT: «Any $!a = Any?»

[11:07] <lizmat> it's happening at a very low level

[11:07] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a is default(42) }; use nqp; dd nqp::getattr(nqp::create(A),A,q/$!a/).VAR.default

[11:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e078d: OUTPUT: «42?»

[11:09] <jnthn> Probably that it isn't setting the value into the container that then later gets cloned

[11:09] <jnthn> Just updating the container descriptor won't suffice

[11:09] <jnthn> Note that the variable one does an assignment into the container

[11:10] <lizmat> I've lost you

[11:11] <lizmat> I just wanted to show that the descriptor *is* set up correctly

[11:11] <jnthn> Yes, it is, my point was that this isn't actually very important.

[11:11] <lizmat> but something is stoking an Any into it

[11:11] <jnthn> Because that's only for introspection by runtime

[11:11] <lizmat> I think it's *very* important

[11:11] <jnthn> You can think what you want, but I know how it works :P

[11:12] <jnthn> The mechanism in both cases is that we clone a "prototype" Scalar

[11:12] <jnthn> In Variable.pm where the var default trait is, we have this line:

[11:12] <jnthn> # make sure we start with the default if a scalar

[11:12] <jnthn> $var = $default if nqp::istype($what, Scalar);

[11:13] <jnthn> That is not, however, taking place in the is default trait for Attribute

[11:13] <lizmat> hmmmm

[11:13] <lizmat> ok,

[11:13] <jnthn> The question being, how we do it :)

[11:13] <jnthn> Ah, right

[11:13] <jnthn> Attribute has a $!auto_viv_container

[11:14] <jnthn> So we need to make sure it ends up assigned into that

[11:14] <jnthn> Ah, and it can be done in the Attribute default trait in traits.pm

[11:14] <lizmat> ok, I will take it from there then  :-)

[11:15] <jnthn> The solution will be something like adding:

[11:15] <jnthn> my \cont := $attr.container;

[11:16] <jnthn> nqp::assign(cont, $defualt) if nqp::istype(cont, Scalar)

[11:16] <jnthn> or

[11:16] <jnthn> my $cont := $attr.container;

[11:16] <jnthn> $cont = $defualt if nqp::istype(cont, Scalar)

[11:16] <jnthn> Saves an nqp op and should be equally good code :)

[11:16] <jnthn> (Saves using one, I mean; it'll generate nqp::assign underneath)

[11:17] <lizmat> ack, lemme try  :-)

[11:37] <timotimo> whoops

[11:38] <timotimo> i, too, can't sleep when there's light; even a little will prevent me from falling asleep, and a bit more than that will easily wake me up

[12:06] <jnthn> Darn it. Some update seems to have screwed things up such that when the auto-logout-because-you-were-inactive thing happens, you just get a black screen and, mouse cursor moving aside, a totally unresponsive system :/

[12:07] <jnthn> Occasionally get hangs coming out of hibernate mode too.

[12:08] <jnthn> brrt: yeah

[12:08] <jnthn> timotimo: Just screen locker :/

[12:08] <timotimo> that's not nice

[12:08] <brrt> part of 'stability' is dealing with the bugs you know rather than the bugs that you don't though :-P

[12:08] <timotimo> though there's a variety of screen lockers to choose from :D

[12:08] <timotimo> what kind of DE are you running?

[12:09] <timotimo> oh

[12:09] <brrt> i always feel like windows is less stable (in my hands) than windows is, but i think i'm ignoring a lot of things that you'd notice :-)

[12:09] <brrt> eh, second windows should be linux :-P

[12:09] <jnthn> tbh I don't even care what it is, in so far as I use the command line + chromium and that's about it :P

[12:09] <timotimo> the ubuntu devs have been brewing their own X replacement for a while that's not gotten any traction outside of ubuntu where you're basically forced to use it :P

[12:10] <ilmari> did they actually switch to it by default?

[12:10] <timotimo> i think they very recently dropped mir development

[12:10] <brrt> ymmv, but you might find fedora to be more polished.

[12:10] <brrt> adn then agian, you might not care

[12:12] <ilmari> has fedora switched to wayland yet?

[12:12] <jnthn> Wow, another 3 billion instructions off as a result of the previous two commits :)

[12:14] <timotimo> i'm still running xorg, but i believe if you install fedora regularly you'll get a gnome3 on wayland now

[12:14] * brrt wonders how many bitcoin can be mined with all the instructions jnthn has saved

[12:14] <brrt> yeah, wayland is standard by now

[12:14] <brrt> i notice a very occasional bug in Qt integration, but other than that

[12:16] <jnthn> Current project: trying to heap-allocate frames that'll obviously get promoted there anyway

[12:16] <nine> jnthn: so you're already outdating the blog post you just wrote?

[12:16] <brrt> and how will you know how obvious that is?

[12:16] <jnthn> Yeah :P

[12:17] <jnthn> brrt: Well, my Plan A is to mark ops that force it (done) and have the bytecode validation note if it seems such an op (done), and then use that flag (doing it now)

[13:05] <jnthn> Seems I've a working patch to allocate on the heap straight off in some cases

[13:05] <jnthn> callgrind is measuring its worthiness

[13:05] <jnthn> Seems to knock some seconds off spectest though

[13:10] *** zakharyas joined
[13:13] <timotimo> nice

[13:15] <jnthn> The callgrind takes ages but at least it takes less ages than it used to :)

[13:16] <timotimo> fewer ages*

[13:16] <timotimo> :P

[13:16] <jnthn> *groan*

[13:21] <jnthn> So I realized over the weekend that there's actually a much simpler solution to getting most of our Perl 6 pass-a-thing-in-a-container dispatches and inlines back

[13:21] <jnthn> Than the super-clever alias analysis

[13:22] <jnthn> Which we'll want some of anyway for doing EA but still

[13:22] <jnthn> We know the type tuples, including deconts, of our callees

[13:23] <jnthn> We can also stash those away at the callsite too

[13:23] <jnthn> Then, provided it's stable, we can trace back from the args to where there's something that fetches the arg and, provided it's a deopt-able instruction, insert a decont + guard there

[13:24] <jnthn> The decont would then be subject to the fetch lowering

[13:24] <jnthn> And the guard a normal STable one

[13:25] * jnthn sets about figuring out the details of that

[13:27] <jnthn> Also, going to make decont a deoptonepoint so we get guards on it

[13:27] <jnthn> Which will also get us some Perl 6 spesh mojo back

[13:27] <jnthn> I like how this guard splitting also naturally means we only enforce the content of the container when we care, whereas before we always did it

[13:43] <jnthn> Oh dear. Things get *worse* after my patch. Hmm.

[13:47] <jnthn> Oh, hmm

[13:47] <jnthn> Of course, since I marked exception

[13:47] <jnthn> But there's loads of code like

[13:47] <jnthn> nqp::die(...blah...) unless $foo

[13:48] <jnthn> hm, though I forgot to mark die

[14:05] <timotimo> cool

[14:07] * jnthn is quite relieved by this

[14:09] <jnthn> Some weeks back I got told it was approved. So I didn't take on $other-work so I could focus on Perl 6 for the summer and dug in. Then got a mail some days later saying some legal process needed to be completed first before the approval could be posted. I figured eh, I'll just get on with stuff, guess it's just a couple more days. Took some weeks in the end. TPF++ for sorting it out, anyways.

[14:12] <jnthn> I think more checks were part of the added cycles, but there's no getting away from the other numbers: we really are causing a lot more GC

[14:13] <jnthn> So a static approach isn't going to fly, I don't think

[14:13] <jnthn> I guess takeclosure must happen more conditionally in NQP than I expected

[14:13] <jnthn> I guess it makes sense given it can flatten more aggressively

[14:14] <jnthn> Guess I'll try a dynamic approach :)

[14:15] <jnthn> Nice thing is, we already have one

[14:15] <jnthn> An invocations counter

[14:16] <jnthn> So if I also count in the heap promotion code

[14:56] <lizmat> ok, I run my spectests at 0500  :-)

[14:57] <ilmari> I remember seeing "02:30 pm" somewhere recently, which is just weird

[14:57] <ilmari> who the hell uses leading zeros with 12h time?

[15:12] *** travis-ci left
[15:13] <jnthn> yay :)

[15:13] <dogbert17> callgrind?

[15:13] <jnthn> No, the travis report agreeing with the earlier fix

[15:13] <jnthn> callgrind still grinding

[15:13] <jnthn> I'm already working on the next thing while it does so :)

[15:16] <dogbert17> saving even more cycles?

[15:19] <jnthn> Well, that's the eventual goal, for now just getting spesh to propagate information about type tuples seen in callees back to their caller's callsite, so we can do better optimization

[15:21] <jnthn> This is more for Rakudo than NQP, though, so will be looking less at CORE.setting compilation during it

[15:32] <japhb> timotimo: What is "the high occurence of memset during Terminal::Print thing"?

[15:33] <japhb> jnthn++  # Memory use and performance hacking

[15:34] <jnthn> Gahhh. :( Latest version of the frame promotion changes are even worse.

[15:35] * lizmat knows that feeling

[15:35] <lizmat> :-(

[15:40] <MasterDuke> i've been experimenting with making MVMString.num_graphs an MVMuint64 (instead of MVMuint32)

[15:40] <yoleaux> 27 Jul 2017 18:37Z <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I'm going to take a nap now, but… bots are broken :) Feel free to investigate: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/24#issuecomment-318444466

[15:40] <yoleaux> 27 Jul 2017 18:38Z <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: well, not completely broken, but a chance of getting MoarVM panic when you do something is really high.

[15:40] <MasterDuke> however, there are lots of places where some MVMint64 value is compared against num_graphs (or something similar, like a substring length)

[15:41] <MasterDuke> i supposing introducing an MVMint128 would not be the preferred solution

[15:45] <jnthn> No.

[15:49] <jnthn> Ok, with thresholds tweaked the wallclocks look better

[15:49] <MasterDuke> right, i'm thinking that a bunch of checks will get/have to go away at the moar level (e.g., if (length < 0) { MVM_exception_throw_adhoc() } else { })

[15:50] <MasterDuke> and such a check would have to be moved up to the nqp/rakudo level

[15:50] <jnthn> Uh

[15:50] <jnthn> No

[15:50] <jnthn> I mean, we have to do checks at VM level to make sure we don't go writing over the ends of buffers and stuff

[15:51] <MasterDuke> well, i mean convert the MVMint64 parameter to an MVMuint64

[15:51] <jnthn> Oh

[15:51] <jnthn> Yeah, that we can do

[15:51] <jnthn> Though

[15:52] <jnthn> A lot of the reason we have MVMint64 is because we receive the value in an i64 register

[15:52] <jnthn> And so it's passed that way from the interp 'cus that's how the interp sees it

[15:52] <MasterDuke> yeah, and uints aren't handled well

[15:52] <MasterDuke> which was also something i had tried to start on a fix for, but didn't make much progress

[15:53] <MasterDuke> but Zoffix has also mentioned he might work on it

[15:54] <MasterDuke> anyway, afk for probably until tomorrow, but will backlog if there are any further thoughts/comments

[16:29] <jnthn> Urgh, no, things are even worse. Doesn't make much sense. :/

[16:29] <nwc10> step away from the keyboard and check the stock level in the beer fridge?

[16:29] <jnthn> Either the predictor is really wrong, or we must have frames that start out getting promoted a lot and then cease to be

[16:29] <nwc10> any test cases that the rest of us can play with?

[16:34] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/frame-heap-prediction: seems to end up doing *worse* for the CORE.setting build, however

[16:34] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/frame-heap-prediction: it looks like it helps `make spectest` wallclock time a bit (though

[18:41] <timotimo> japhb: profiling moarvm while running the examples from that library gives a surprising amount of time spent in memset

[18:46] <nwc10> jnthn: frustratingly ASAN makes no comment

[18:47] <nwc10> but I'm guessing that wasn't the problem. It was "why is this slower?"

[18:47] <timotimo> yeah, it was

[18:48] <timotimo> we might want to debug-printf stats about what exact frames used to get promoted (how often) and which frames are now being pre-promoted and post-promoted

[18:49] <nwc10> oh gosh it's fast when you build O2 rather than ASAN :-)

[20:04] <japhb> timotimo: Interesting.  Maybe because of all the 2D-array slinging or the string joinging or the I/O?  There's a lot of copying between backing buffers and the screen grid, and then outputting massive strings of grid updates to the TTY.

[20:05] <japhb> (Terminal::Print::Grid should show a fair number of low-level and high-use actions.)

[20:05] <japhb> If you're seeing it in the particle-rendering code, that gets even more interesting, because there's a particle-to-grid-cell collation pass.

[22:35] <timotimo> cool. fprinting the numbers that take part in the "if" for resolving annotations makes the "use of uninitialized value" messages go away
