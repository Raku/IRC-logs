[05:14] <samcv> well it's a subtype of Numeric_Type and a has no Numeric_Type property. so it's wrong. though also i am not sure what Digit was supposed to mean

[05:15] <samcv> since there's Numeric, Digit and Decimal or something

[05:16] <samcv> so i'm not sure why it's a "subtype" and why it tries to add it as its own property.

[05:16] <samcv> m: say 0x00B2.uniprop('Numeric_Type')

[05:16] <samcv> but that should show Digit
