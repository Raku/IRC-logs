[00:02] <dogbert11> the odd thing is that I don't think the SEGV shows up if the NFG check is off

[00:03] <samcv> ok i think i may have fixed it. well. i think you might be right they are separate

[00:04] <samcv> well. or maybe not completely. anyway there was issues

[00:04] <dogbert11> two different problems?

[00:05] <samcv> well maybe differet problems. that just got exposed by the checks

[00:06] <dogbert11> aha, and you've fixed one?

[00:07] <samcv> well i fixed that NULL problem in re_nfg that was one. and the NULL in the NFG_debug and uh

[00:07] <samcv> so i am fixing things hah

[00:08] <dogbert11> and the KMP fix as a bonus :)

[00:08] <samcv> and that

[00:08] <samcv> you should try that sometime the clang option i said

[00:08] <samcv> super cool.

[00:08] <samcv> not as slow as valgrind

[00:08] <samcv> though it does kill the program when it finds a problem. but it gives a lot of info

[00:09] <samcv> and there's a problem that the result of concatenation was getting freed during concatenation

[00:09] <samcv> and i'm gonna push that shortly

[08:42] <samcv> .tell dogbert17 check out how the address sanitizer for clang works: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm very interesting how it works. even though this is how it works, it runs way faster than valgrind probably since doesn't have to run inside and have that overhead

[08:42] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to dogbert17.

[08:46] <timotimo> samcv: valgrind has the added benefit that you don't have to recompile. which is especially good if you don't have access to the source code of parts or the whole program

[08:46] <samcv> yeah. though the clang one detected problems valgrind never did

[08:46] <samcv> and detected problems accessing stuff on the stack as well

[08:47] <samcv> but yeah. you don't always have the ability to want to quickly recompile

[08:48] <samcv> this is their comparison https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerComparisonOfMemoryTools

[08:49] <samcv> optionally you can have t do stack-use-after-return. that's neat

[08:49] <samcv> in case you return an object on the others stack and then you shouldn't access it

[09:14] *** dogbert11 joined
[09:22] <dogbert11> samcv, the revert made the number of failing spectests go up significantly

[09:31] <timotimo> time to move this work off to a branch so we can flatten eventual reverts and such away when we merge?

[09:31] <timotimo> oh

[09:31] <timotimo> it only crashes on travis master m(

[10:58] <timotimo> things we should have: dup and maybe dup2 for IO::Handle. also, creating IO::Handle.from-fileno or .from-native-descriptor

[12:16] <nine> I can now JIT native calls with one uncontainerized int64 or CPointer argument :)

[12:20] <timotimo> nice

[12:21] <timotimo> that's already pretty useful

[12:21] <timotimo> when you get two, that's a big step into useful territory

[12:22] <nine> I think deconting is more important even

[12:22] <timotimo> true

[12:22] <nine> At least if I ever want to merge this thing ;)

[12:23] <nine> I'm just not sure in which layer exactly to do that.

[12:24] <timotimo> if we emit the decont in spesh we can turn it into simpler operations in some cases

[12:24] <timotimo> like known type and such

[12:26] <nine> Yeah, I guess it's best (and probably easiest, too) to decont in the generated routine body when binding params to locals. Right now I access the args buffer of the callsite directly.

[12:26] <nine> So a bit of work to change that, but probably not really difficult.

[14:08] <nine> So what's the correct way to get a deconted param into a local?

[14:09] * lizmat has no idea

[14:10] <timotimo> regular param op and a decont after that i'd say

[14:12] <nine> Like this? QAST::Var.new( :name($lowered_name), :scope<local>, :decl<param>), QAST::Op.new( :op<bind>, QAST::Var.new(:scope<local>, :name($lowered_name)), QAST::Op.new(:op<decont>, QAST::Var.new(:scope<local>, :name($lowered_name))),)

[14:18] <timotimo> i think so

[14:19] <nine> Yes, looks good :) Now I only hav eto change the JITed code to access locals instead of params

[14:19] <timotimo> cool

[14:20] <nine> Would be easier though if I weren't as tired

[14:22] <samcv> dogbert11, are you sure they went up?

[14:23] <samcv> i just woke up i can run again but i remember running them again

[14:43] <dogbert11> hello samcv :)

[14:44] <dogbert11> ok, I'll check out master and try again ...

[14:48] <dogbert11> so I'm at the S04 tests now and there's been complaints from 20 files already

[14:48] <dogbert11> ofc they could all be errors uncovered by the NFG checker

[14:49] <samcv> i have that off right now

[14:49] <samcv> so it must be the NFG checker

[14:49] <samcv> i think it's probably good if we set all pointers to start as NULL. and the compiler will always optimize it out or otherwise the performance difference is basically none

[14:50] <dogbert11> sounds like a plan, btw have you had your tea yet?

[14:50] <samcv> though it should get compiled out if there's no way for it to be used, if it's okay i will start commiting more pointers to be initialized as NULL

[14:50] <samcv> no!

[14:50] <dogbert11> uh oh

[14:50] <samcv> yep

[14:52] <dogbert11> FWIW I rambled a bit about the Malformed UTF8 problem over in the dev channel

[14:52] <samcv> i get full spectest pass

[14:52] <dogbert11> without the checker so do I

[14:53] <timotimo> i know how to make this faster! i'll build a binary format!

[14:53] <timotimo> -- 10 hours later --

[14:56] <samcv> dogbert11, but you say that with my reversion more tests fail (with the NFG checker) than before?

[14:58] <nine> /win/win 10

[14:58] <samcv> for some reason if i ./Configure.pl --asan then i can't run it. does it include its own version of asan?

[14:59] <samcv> cause if i put -fsanitize=address manually it works fine

[15:02] <samcv> well i'm going to try running spectest with asan and nfg check on and see if it catches anything

[15:03] <dogbert11> let me try without the revert

[15:03] * dogbert11 rebuilds

[15:05] <dogbert11> if I run asan with gcc I have to use that option

[15:05] <samcv> yeah. probably since we must include the library. but clang has its own never version and otherwise i get a mismatch

[15:06] <samcv> ugh why do i get failing tests with `make spectest` but not running them by themselves

[15:06] <dogbert11> am at S06 now, only one fail so far ...

[15:06] <nine> timotimo: looks to me like spesh will quite happily throw my deconts away as it doesn't know that the nativecallinvokejit op will access the locals. Any idea how to avoid that?

[15:07] <timotimo> oh

[15:07] <timotimo> yeah that's a problem

[15:07] <dogbert11> samcv: the synthetics errors we saw yesterday, could those have been legit?

[15:08] <samcv> uh corruption

[15:08] <samcv> idk if that's legit or nonlegit?

[15:08] <samcv> but probably something being freed when it shouldn't

[15:09] <dogbert11> only five fails now

[15:09] <timotimo> nine: short of inventing an op that does nothing except touch a variable ... :\

[15:09] <timotimo> i mean, we could put the args into the nativecallinvoke op's signature, but we'd have to have a whole bunch of these ops

[15:09] <samcv> oh well i guess maybe it could be legit idk hard to tell. but really. it seems odd...

[15:10] <samcv> i'm getting lots of failures but some of them i would run the test manually and pass fine

[15:10] <dogbert11> samcv, now t/spec/S15-nfg/concatenation.t fails with error, 'MoarVM cannot get Unicode codepoint property for synthetic codepoint -11'

[15:10] <samcv> yep

[15:11] <dogbert11> do you think that's due to corruption or could it in fact be legit?

[15:12] <samcv> oh it could be legit idk... it was super confusing to me yesterday

[15:12] <dogbert11> let's take another look, sec

[15:12] <samcv> yeah i made several changes in that one commit. i'm going to make one at a time

[15:13] <nine> timotimo: or teach spesh about nativecallinvokejit touching locals?

[15:14] <timotimo> okay, but which does it touch?

[15:14] <timotimo> you can teach facts.c about that op

[15:14] <timotimo> but you need to find the right register and version for this to work

[15:15] <nine> timotimo: well version 2 of all locals in that frame

[15:15] <timotimo> if we're willing to rely on this ...

[15:16] <dogbert11> samcv: here's gdb output https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b6a5ed3456e4301a67d87cef9868f116

[15:17] <timotimo> so ... you know how i made that binary format to make moar-heapanalyzer faster?

[15:17] <timotimo> it's slower by a factor of like 6

[15:17] <nine> For the first implementation of this I'd say yes.

[15:19] <timotimo> ok, so in facts.c you can, when you stumble upon a nativecallinvokejit, bump up the usages of all locals of version 2, i.e. for loop from 0 to num-locals from somewhere in the spesh graph

[15:19] <dogbert11> this is the failing test: is-deeply ('a' x 2 ~ "\c[COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT]" x 3).ords, (97, 225, 769, 769), "Concat works with combining repeated characters";

[15:20] <nine> timotimo: yep, that's pretty clear. But not where the facts for the locals are actually

[15:21] <nine> There's num_locals in MVMSpeshGraph, but I can't find any list representing locals

[15:21] <timotimo> you go through the fact functions

[15:21] <timotimo> oh, you pass them a MVMSpeshOperand

[15:21] <timotimo> no, actually, i think you pass register and version separately

[15:22] <timotimo> so no problems at all there

[15:22] <samcv> dogbert11, that fails without it reverted?

[15:23] <samcv> yeah i'm getting that too

[15:23] <dogbert11> let me check that

[15:24] <dogbert11> with the revert in place it does not fail

[15:26] <timotimo> 4:46 to get a summary of the snapshot in my new version; 42s in the old version (with compatibility changes that might make it slower)

[15:27] <nine> timotimo: like case MVM_OP_nativecallinvokejit: for (i = 0; i < g->num_locals; i++) { g->facts[i][2]->usages++ } break;?

[15:30] <timotimo> yeah, try that

[15:31] <nine> or rather [i][1] as I guess we start counting at 0? :)

[15:32] <timotimo> could very well be, or maybe we only output it like that for human readability?

[15:33] <nine> No change so far...

[15:34] <nine> LOL setting MVM_SPESH_LOG "fixes" the issue

[15:34] <timotimo> somehow the C recompile got messed up perhaps?

[15:35] *** AlexDaniel joined
[15:35] <nine> No...for some reason it just starts to spesh later and thus never. Upping the eiiteration count helps

[15:38] <timotimo> :buffer on IO::Handle won't work for :bin?

[15:38] <timotimo> i.e. it's still doing the exact reads as syscalls that i'm calling from my hll code

[15:41] <nine> According to the spesh log, the usages are still all 0

[15:47] <samcv> ok i found the problem dogbert11

[15:47] <dogbert11> wee

[15:47] <dogbert11> what was it?

[15:48] <samcv> gonna run spectest. but

[15:49] <samcv> it was running NFG_CHECK_CONCAT when it shouldn't have. i.e. when it was going to return re_nfg anyway because the concatted string wouldn't have been correct

[15:49] <samcv> though still dunno why it would say something about a negative grapheme but. that was the cause

[15:49] <samcv> gonna run spectest to make sure

[15:49] <dogbert11> I'll wait :)

[15:51] <samcv> ugh i wish asan wouldn't cause spectest's to fail for no reason then i run them again and it's fine. they show that they didn't run any tests, so i'm not sure what happened. how can i run tests but show full stderr?

[15:53] <dogbert11> I would like to know that as well

[15:54] <samcv> ugh getting errors

[15:54] <samcv> well from asan

[15:54] <samcv> on make m-spectest

[15:54] <samcv> well starting it

[15:55] <samcv> yeah this is the same issue i had before and why i added `result` to the MVMROOT. let me add that again

[15:56] <samcv> ok cool. fixed it now by adding that :)

[15:58] <nine> timotimo: ha! ase MVM_OP_nativecallinvokejit: for (i = 0; i < g->num_locals; i++) g->facts[i][g->fact_counts[i] - 1].usages++; break;

[15:59] <samcv> dogbert11, this is my fix though https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/08e7874bdd59f92220565d44eaa3a697db7a9de5

[16:00] <timotimo> CurrentThreadScheduler is a godsend

[16:00] <timotimo> why are you going to the facts array directly?

[16:00] <timotimo> oh you were doing that before

[16:00] <nine> timotimo: I dare say this is actually even pretty safe. Worst case it prevents some instruction elimination.

[16:00] <timotimo> why didn't i yell at you

[16:01] <nine> timotimo: tweak_block_handler_usage does it, too

[16:01] <timotimo> hm.

[16:01] <timotimo> naughty naughty

[16:03] <nine> So containers are now handled which gives us full access to CPointer arguments. Unboxing however isn't yet and the deconting code seems to have broken even the workaround (passing a native int)

[16:08] <samcv> ugh --verbosity doesn't seem to work? set it to 10 and get only progress bars. ]set to 1 and i get only progress bar

[16:08] <timotimo> 2:46m now instead of the 442s

[16:08] <samcv> set to 0 and it is the same as it is normally

[16:09] <dogbert11> perhaps it's not fully implemented

[16:10] <samcv> Zoffix, any help?

[16:10] <samcv> zoffix always knows secrets with roast

[16:11] <samcv> idk if it's skipping these tests because they are taking a long time to run? i get "no subtests run", if i run manually it takes a while for it to start outputting stuff at all. so maybe it's just killing it when it doesn't get output for a period?

[16:11] <samcv> (harness5 here)

[16:13] <dogbert11> are you running with asan?

[16:13] <dogbert11> also, harness6 is broken so we have no alternatives atm :)

[16:13] <samcv> yeah with asan

[16:14] <timotimo> someone want to implement buffered binary reading? :)

[16:14] <dogbert11> I sometimes forget that mem requirements double when usin that switch

[16:14] <dogbert11> *using

[16:14] <timotimo> maybe i should ask in #perl6, as this is a hll task

[16:14] <samcv> i think it's slower too cause i have it set to `detect_stack_use_after_return=1 ` as well

[16:14] <samcv> i think that slows it down

[16:14] <dogbert11> no swapping?

[16:35] <samcv> how do i fix "Unhandled exception: Missing or wrong version of dependency "

[16:35] <samcv> i mean when running my system's perl6 inside the rakudo git folder

[16:36] <samcv> i want it not to fail like that

[16:36] <samcv> is there some env var?

[16:36] <samcv> also i hate this error :P

[16:56] <samcv> oh. getting make spectest to be verbose

[16:57] <samcv> i want to get all stderr messages to my terminal

[16:57] <samcv> i haven't been able to do it by setting --verbosity but i may be doing it wrong or setting it to the wrong number

[16:58] <Zoffix> samcv: no idea. If you use t/fudgeandrun file1 file2 it'll be verbose. But I don't know an easy way to run all tests verbosely

[16:58] <nine> Ok, integer arguments are just not there yet due to missing unboxing support, but I do support an arbitrary number of pointer arguments now :)

[16:59] <Zoffix> samcv: did you try --verbosity=1 ?

[16:59] <samcv> i think i did. will try again though

[17:06] <Zoffix> No idea how to make it just normal verbose output with all the things

[17:06] * Zoffix goes back lurking

[17:06] <timotimo> whoops, double-freeing all the stuff

[17:07] <timotimo> turns out just nativecasting to Pointer will not mark the Pointer for "will not be freed"

[17:08] <timotimo> how do i even nativecast

[17:25] <samcv> hmm it seems when re_nfg is ran, if the string is utf8-c8, it comes out with a different number of graphemes afterward

[17:26] <timotimo> does it misunderstand the special graphemes we make for our c8 thingies?

[17:28] <timotimo> what's with these ords

[17:28] <samcv> m: my @ints = 103, 248, 111, 217, 210, 97; my $b = Buf.new(@ints); my Str $u=$b.decode("utf8-c8"); say $u.comb; $u.=subst("a","a"); say $u.comb

[17:28] <samcv> well it's utf8-c8

[17:28] <timotimo> but still

[17:29] <samcv> m: my @ints = 103, 248, 111, 217, 210, 97; my $b = Buf.new(@ints); my Str $u=$b.decode("utf8-c8"); say $u.comb.join(', '); $u.=subst("a","a"); say $u.comb.join(', ')

[17:29] <samcv> so yeah it's losing the utf8-c8 graphemes

[17:30] <samcv> poop

[17:30] <samcv> timotimo, maybe if it loses the graphemes, it can still write as utf-c8 properly?

[17:30] *** benchable6 joined
[17:30] <samcv> but still you colud then replace the letters that make it up like replace all D's with something and ruin the utf8-c8

[17:31] <samcv> ah it iterates by codepoint

[17:32] <samcv> poop poop

[19:07] <timotimo> not sure fi i can get it faster than the 20 seconds i have now

[19:08] <timotimo> maybe if i split the collectables in half as well, not only the references

[19:08] <timotimo> this code will want a bit of cleanup for clarity when i'm done making it fast

[19:21] <timotimo> 17 seconds!

[19:33] <timotimo> pushed all changes to the heapanalyzer

[19:38] *** AlexDaniel joined
[19:42] <timotimo> it looks like the amount of ram claim is wrong, or at least i threw out the benefit by parallelizing harder

[19:54] <samcv> so this lets us dump the memory heaps or what

[20:00] <timotimo> it's a step in the right direction

[20:00] <samcv> or it analyzes them? give me a rundown?

[20:00] <samcv> nice

[20:01] <timotimo> it's two parts

[20:01] <timotimo> one is the new format that moar can spit out

[20:01] <timotimo> it can get by completely without MVM objects and hll code

[20:01] <timotimo> the other part is support for this format in the heap analyzer

[20:01] <timotimo> it's around 2x faster, but uses more memory

[20:01] <timotimo> that ought to let us work with stuff a bit faster

[20:02] <timotimo> one other thing that would be nice would be to maybe parallelize the breadth-first search

[20:03] <timotimo> does that make sense?

[20:04] <timotimo> the heapsnapshot_binary_format branch will just unconditionally write to /tmp/heapsnapshot_new_format whenever a heapsnapshot is finished

[20:05] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: was it you who was interested in faster heap snapshot loading?

[20:06] <timotimo> i know it was a whateverable developer :D

[20:11] <samcv> nice

[20:11] <timotimo> next on the feature request list is being able to get all-paths to nodes

[20:12] <samcv> looks like we have a heap-buffer-overflow

[20:13] <samcv> addresssanitizer is angry

[20:13] <samcv> 244 bytes to the left of the closest area

[20:14] <samcv> looks like is_stack_frame() is checking a stack frame's struct value, but that's actually not inside any mapped memory

[20:14] <samcv> timotimo, MVM_gc_allocate_nursery() is that run on start and not like, afterward?

[20:14] <samcv> cause that's a calling function in the chain

[20:17] <timotimo> now i'm wondering if i should always generate an allpaths or only sometimes

[20:18] <timotimo> the "all paths" for type objects can get hilariously big

[20:22] <timotimo> i could either run a bfs and note down all predecessors and just stop adding more after reaching 10 or something, or i do a new DFS each time an all-paths is asked for

[20:25] <timotimo> i'll try DFS in a gather/take and let the user stop it whenever they want to

[21:19] <samcv> wow so far the address saniiser hasn't puked when running roast. yay

[21:20] <timotimo> cool

[21:20] <timotimo> i'm not being very good at the whole "build a dfs" thing

[21:22] <samcv> so this is in perl6 then, not C?

[21:22] <timotimo> it is

[21:23] <samcv> it hung somewhere but it ran 228 tests and all pass

[21:28] <timotimo> okay the dfs for a single object is currently 83k steps away from the root and is still going

[21:29] <timotimo> it's nice that i print " " x $length-of-that-path before each debug output

[21:30] <samcv> heh

[21:31] <timotimo> oops

[21:31] <timotimo> i was looking at the size of the queue

[21:33] <timotimo> it looks like there's a load of gc pauses every now and then but it shouldn't be creating many objects that live long

[21:37] <timotimo> i'll go to bed i think

[21:43] * lizmat too

[21:44] <lizmat> good night,!

[23:44] <samcv> jnthn, i've been thinking of how we can fix codepoint iterators when renormalizing and retain the UTF8-c8 graphemes. not sure if we should change the codepoint iterator to either have an option you can set to allow it to hand back synthetics (but only utf8c8 synthetics) so they pass them along. and most of our things will assume they're control because they're less than 20
