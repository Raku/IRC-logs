[13:51] <samcv> good * all-

[13:52] <lizmat> samcv o/

[13:52] * lizmat hopes samcv has been synchronized  :-)

[13:52] <samcv> yeah doing pretty good now

[13:53] <lizmat> :-)

[13:53] <samcv> was up at 8am

[13:53] <lizmat> that's early for me :-)

[13:54] <nwc10> you get more morning that way

[13:54] <samcv> well that's 11pm in california

[13:55] <brrt> ohai samcv

[13:55] <samcv> working on getting us able to test every unicode codepoint

[13:55] <lizmat> whee!  :-)

[13:55] <lizmat> .oO( test all the things )

[13:55] <samcv> trying to get it to work with Test. since not like i'm going to have 800,000 is-deeply's

[13:56] <samcv> and it would slow it down. i already made many things be in nqp so it doesn't take minutes to work

[13:56] <lizmat> some files in roast are generated

[13:56] <lizmat> perhaps that could be an inspiration ?

[13:56] <samcv> well. it is going to read the unicode files themselves. that is much faster than generating a million line file

[13:57] <nwc10> IIRC the way I'd (tried to) things like that before (in Perl 5) was to do the actual test in regular code, then if it failed re-test it with Test::More, so that it fails, generates diagnostics, and gets counted

[13:57] <samcv> but i'm trying to get a series of todo's working so that you set in the file how many failures you expect. and it will pass or fail or todo things depending on such

[13:57] <lizmat> well, that sounds ok, but that doesn't guarantee that parsing of every unicode char actually works

[13:57] <samcv> so if you pass more than it thought you were going to, then the todo'd thing will pass. and if not then it will not be todo'd

[13:57] <nwc10> and then have something that also outputs the number of implicitly passing tests that weren't reported

[13:57] <samcv> and it will be a raw failure

[13:58] <nwc10> OK, what I just said doesn't sound like it helps totally here

[13:58] <samcv> not ok 2 - Property General_Category from file extracted/DerivedGeneralCategory.txt General_Category=Cn got <= 97 failures # TODO Expecting 97 failures from General_Category=Cn

[13:58] <nwc10> er, however, one internal optimisation that IIRC Test::More in Perl 5 now has is to assume that most tests pass most of the time

[13:58] <nwc10> and not store the array of passing test numbers if they all have

[13:58] <nwc10> but just the highest pass

[13:58] <samcv> should probably change the wording a bit it makes it sound like the test tests something different

[13:59] <nwc10> and extrapolate that as 1 .. $n

[13:59] <nwc10> whenever asked about it
