[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix HLL representations of CArray elements out of sync after native calls

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: For CArrays with elements that are wrapped in HLL objects like strings,

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: CPointers or CArrays, we have to refresh the HLL representations after passing

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: those arrays to native functions as the native code may change the data. For

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: now just detect those cases and don't JIT compile the calls.

[08:11] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fixes rakudo GH #1220

[21:59] <samcv> ok i am gonna do something since i haven't done much lately hah

[21:59] <lizmat> :-)

[21:59] <samcv> going through some rt tickets. looks like there's an issue of no general category being set for codepoints with no props

[21:59] <samcv> m: 0xFFFF.uniprop.say

[21:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar ae1f0fdaf: OUTPUT: «␤»

[22:20] <samcv> looks like we don't handle returning default values for properties at all

[22:21] <samcv> only explictly things set in ucd2c.pl

[22:24] *** Ven joined
[22:31] <samcv> now to run spectest, no clue what it will tell me when i have it return the 0th value in the enum's when it can't find the codepoint_row

[22:31] <samcv> should at least fix that one test

[22:34] *** ggoebel joined
[23:58] <samcv> ok well can't fix that bug but i can fix some part of it

[23:58] <samcv> gonna be hard to get chars without info in them to have <:C> match Cn characters (Unassigned)(

[23:59] <samcv> but i can at least have .uniprop for general category work right
