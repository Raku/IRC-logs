[02:18] <samcv> pasted this in perl6-dev but

[02:19] <samcv> looks like moarvm doesn't have a point release. and we have 2017.04.3 but no newer tagged version of moarvm

[02:19] <samcv> or nqp. since the fixed in .3 needed updates to moarvm

[02:24] <samcv> do we want to make a point release so distros can update moarvm/nqp and thus get 2017.04.3? seems it would make sense

[02:31] <MasterDuke_> 2017.05 is only about a week away...

[02:57] <samcv> ok

[02:58] <samcv> so we just wait until 2017.05? i mean still it's weird for a tagged release to not be able to be installed based on other tags

[03:01] <samcv> i mean it's easy enough to add tags for the nqp and moarvm revisions on which it depends on

[06:03] <brrt> ugh, i found a new bug

[06:10] <samcv> such is life

[07:15] <brrt> it's always a bit dissapointing, though, when the bug turns out to be so‚Ä¶ banal

[07:29] <brrt> hehe, bug!

[07:49] <brrt> i do wonder why the jit bisection script just won't work on OS X

[07:56] <samcv> what's it written in?

[08:23] <lizmat> morning!

[08:23] <brrt> morning lizmat

[08:23] <brrt> how's the #pts

[08:24] <lizmat> so I want to add the information contained in nqp/gen/moar/stage1/nqp-config.nqp as part of the perl6 -V output

[08:24] <brrt> uhuh

[08:24] <lizmat> busy  :-)

[08:24] <lizmat> wish I felt better  :-(

[08:24] * brrt wishes you better

[08:25] <lizmat> brrt: thanks  :-)_

[08:25] <lizmat> probably should ask this on perl6-dev

[10:20] <samcv> i'm gonna add info of the tags to the 2017.04.3 release page. since adding tags for a nonrelease seems no bueno. that will at least tie up that end enough for my satisfaction

[21:35] <samcv> Zoffix, added info about the dev/escape.p6 and dev/unescape.p6 utilities to CONTRIBUTING.md for atom-language-perl6

[21:35] <samcv> if you use those you will never have escaping problems again :)

[21:35] <samcv> much easier to edit things when they are in *normal* form and you only have to deal with the regex escapes

[22:23] <timotimo> i wonder if we can do better when failing to allocate more memory because we're infinitely recursing

[22:24] <timotimo> like, figure out if we're mallocing because we're trying to have space for stack frames

[22:32] <timotimo> it's problematic because we also allocate other stuff while infini-recursing, so it won't always be the callstack region being expanded that causes the problem

[22:33] <jnthn> And if the frame always escapes the stack by being heap-promoted that approach won't work anyway

[22:35] <jnthn> Not to mention that another therad may hit the out of memory condition than the one that infinitely recurses

[22:35] <jnthn> *thread

[22:38] <timotimo> right

[22:38] <timotimo> we could change the out of memory panic function to inspect the TC and instance and such

[22:38] <timotimo> to see what's currently most expensive

[22:42] <jnthn> Maybe but it doesn't get passed tc or instance

[22:43] <timotimo> right. we can add a function that does analysis before, and pass tc whenever we allocate in a way where it's convenient for us to pass stuff
