[20:27] <dogbert17> jnthn: you around?

[20:28] <dogbert17> it looks as if IO::Socket::get is not documented, is that method the opposite of IO::Socket::put?

[20:28] *** AlexDaniel joined
[20:28] <dogbert17> or print

[20:29] <jnthn> It works like .get on IO::Handle

[20:29] <yoleaux> 18:20Z <azawawi> jnthn: regarding your .oO( Who wants to write Inline::Go? :P )  # New experimental pet project https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-inline-go (Inline::Go) :)

[20:30] * dogbert17 lools

[20:30] <dogbert17> (sigh) *looks

[20:31] <jnthn> lool: a drooling lol

[20:31] <dogbert17> :)

[20:35] <dogbert17> so, something like this then ? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/61a698110173b3aced0a017c9b11e515

[20:37] <jnthn> m: IO::Socket::INET.chomp

[20:38] <jnthn> grrr

[20:38] <jnthn> Anyway, just check it really does have chomp but I'm pretty sure it does :)

[20:38] <dogbert17> $line = $!decoder.consume-line-chars(:chomp);

[20:42] <jnthn> ah, :chomp suggest it's always doing it

[20:43] <jnthn> Not passing a :$!chomp or so

[20:43] <jnthn> time for a little fresh air; bbiab

[23:29] <samcv> ok so bidi_mirroring_glyph went from 16bits wide to 9, and MVM_COLLATION_PRIMARY from 19 to 15

[23:30] <jnthn> So, smaller DB? :)

[23:31] <samcv> well atm it seems to be the same size

[23:31] <samcv> haven't investigated that yet. but potentially yeah
