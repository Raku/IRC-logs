[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Add timeouts to JIT debugging tools

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Sometimes a miscompile doesn't cause a program to crash but instead loop

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: forever. A timeout paramter on jit-bisect enables detection. On linux,

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: the standard 'timeout' utiltiy is also available for the same purpose,

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: but not every system is linux.

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[16:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: I have no idea if this will work on windows.

[19:12] <brrt> good hi!

[19:12] <brrt> the timeout-enabled bisect yielded some result...

[19:13] <brrt> as in, the consistent problem-giver is an innocent looking piece of code

[19:33] <brrt> and, we're looping forever within the same code...

[19:39] <timotimo> yo

[19:39] <timotimo> that's weird :(

[19:39] <brrt> in the same frame, never invoking a subframe

[19:40] <brrt> it's odd, but not so odd that i won't figure it out

[19:40] <brrt> but not tonight

[19:40] <brrt> :-)
