[17:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 4a5d21a561 | (Samantha McVey)++ | docs/ChangeLog

[17:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Update ChangeLog

[17:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/4a5d21a561

[17:42] <samcv> i have updated the changelog. i hope my explaination about my changes are ok. if not they can be edited down. if someone else wants to release, that is fine with me. i've tested for any issues and the current UCD has no issues with any codepoints resolving to the wrong codepoint_row

[17:42] <samcv> i'm on the train right now but i won't be back until up to 5 hours from now

[17:44] <[Coke]> samcv++

[17:45] <samcv> [Coke]: what do you think on the Unicode section? is it ok even though it's long? at least in your opinion

[17:45] <samcv> and technically doesn't say things that have currently changed but..

[17:47] <[Coke]> I didn't compare it to the commit history, but it seems fine

[17:48] <samcv> yeah no need to do that, thank you though

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> samcv: patience is a virtue, I have no problems having a release a bit later

[17:50] <samcv> ok. thanks

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> fwiw branches are cheap so this shouldn't be stopping anyone from committing (not to master tho)
