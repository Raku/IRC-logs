[12:11] <Zoffix> Would someone with keys check all of MoarVM org's repos that have webhooks for bot commits announcements have them set up to with URL http://hack.p6c.org:8888/?chan=#moarvm ? I already done it for MoarVM/MoarVM, but don't have access to other repos

[20:06] <Zoffix> So we got some fork of libtommath or somethin? They made second fix for expmod, how do we pull in this fix? https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/issues/67#issuecomment-336654018

[20:12] <timotimo> yeah we have a libtommath repo under moarvm/

[20:13] *** robertle joined
[20:13] <timotimo> i'm not entirely sure why we made our own fork

[20:18] <Zoffix> timotimo: do I just cherry pick that commit? into that repo and moarvm will automagically use it?

[20:18] <timotimo> Zoffix: looks like we literally just have the fork for the inclomplete fix for the expmod thing

[20:18] <Zoffix> hah

[20:18] <Zoffix> Maybe I shouldn't touch this.

[20:19] <timotimo> you'd also want to check out the newer commit in the submodule

[20:19] <timotimo> hm. another DJ just started and they got like 2x the volume compared to the previous one

[20:24] <Zoffix> Yeah, I remember all the issues we had with libtommath repo last time during builds. So I'm not gonna touch it, 'cause I'm a n00b. But they added a new fix to expmod and asking if it's working, so if someone could try it out and respond that'd be great: https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/issues/67#issuecomment-336654018

[20:25] * Zoffix opens an Issue

[20:25] <timotimo> oh

[20:25] <timotimo> was that libtommath, yeah?

[20:25] <timotimo> that was when it wasn't a submodule and i turned it into one

[20:26] <timotimo> and nobody could "git pull" because there was this mysterious "libtommath" directory that would have been overwritten with a "libtommath" directory

[20:26] <timotimo> and clearly that's a no-go

[20:27] <Zoffix> There was alrteady issue for it. I commented there: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/549#issuecomment-336664939

[20:32] <timotimo> i got oropax (earplugs) and a power cord now

[20:37] <timotimo> why am i doing this on my laptop %)

[20:40] <samcv> getting that merged

[20:42] <timotimo> i'm running spectests with very latest libtommath now

[20:46] <timotimo> haha, they really have something called SLURM?

[20:48] <timotimo> that's amazing. poznan++

[20:48] <Zoffix> rofl

[20:49] <timotimo> q:to/qapla'/ actually works <Â³

[20:49] <timotimo> er

[20:49] <timotimo> <3

[20:49] <samcv> slurm?

[20:50] <samcv> what is SLURM in libtommath

[20:50] *** TimToady joined
[20:51] *** robertle joined
[20:51] <timotimo> no, it's for scheduling and such

[20:51] <timotimo> for clusters

[20:52] <timotimo> Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)

[20:52] <timotimo> i actually wrong-windowed slurm into #moarvm even though i meant it to be in #perl5

[20:52] <timotimo> ...

[20:52] <timotimo> #perl6

[20:53] <timotimo> huh. i grabbed the newest libtommath stuff and the expmod test file now hangs?

[20:54] <timotimo> oooooh

[20:54] <timotimo> it's in a branch

[20:55] <timotimo> let's try that again

[20:57] <timotimo> i assume i'd have to add an extra test or two to the file which used to hang it

[20:58] <timotimo> that was a bad formulation

[21:01] <mst> I was assuming it was another joke reference to Futurama

[21:05] <timotimo> it probably i

[21:05] <timotimo> is

[21:07] <timotimo> there's just one fudge ni the expmod file and that passes with the fixed branch of libtom

[21:08] <Zoffix> timotimo: in roast? Yeah, there's one fudge I wrote for some ticket where I spotted that it hangs with more than just `-1` for an arg (or whatever it was)

[21:09] <timotimo> right

[21:10] <timotimo> should i systematically try lots of different arg combinations?

[21:10] <Zoffix> prolly

[21:10] <timotimo> i can also push The Stuff if you'd like to try yourself?

[21:11] <Zoffix> push

[21:11] <Zoffix> oh wait

[21:11] <Zoffix> I don't wanna try

[21:12] <Zoffix> Just push so it's awailable for everyone :)

[21:12] <timotimo> :)

[21:12] <timotimo> junctions ftw

[21:12] <timotimo> expmod(any(^100), any(^100), any(^100))

[21:12] <Zoffix> :D

[21:12] <timotimo> it prints a result

[21:12] <timotimo> so that means it doesn't hang

[21:13] <timotimo> it doesn't parallelize though

[21:13] <Zoffix> you didn't exercise the bug with ^100 tho

[21:13] <Zoffix> it needed negatives or something

[21:13] <timotimo> oh

[21:13] <timotimo> which one?

[21:16] <timotimo> ok now with ^1000 three times it either hangs or takes a long time, and i'm not sure which :D

[21:17] <Zoffix> m: expmod(42, -1, 7)

[21:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 785d2f251: OUTPUT: Â«(timeout)Â»

[21:18] <timotimo> expmod(any(^100), -1, any(^100)) doesn't hang

[21:19] <Zoffix> \o/

[21:28] <timotimo> hm. it's rather slow, but at least expmod accounts for 72.4% of total run time

[21:28] <timotimo> it looks like it's preventing the containing block from being jitted

[21:29] <timotimo> it'd be trivial to jit that op

[21:29] <timotimo> let's see how much faster that would make it

[21:31] <timotimo> pff, what

[21:31] <timotimo> expmod takes the result as an argument. i'd have to fix that first

[21:34] <timotimo> damn, if we pull the repr_alloc_init out of the bigint op functions again later we can spesh them into optimized object initialization

[21:37] <timotimo> don't actually wanna do it right now

[21:42] <timotimo> i'd be interested to hear how far we are away from combining a spesh fact "known type" with a "call the allocate reprop" from inside an expr tree in the new jit
