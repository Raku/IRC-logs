[08:24] <timotimo> my poor system ...

[08:36] *** domidumont joined
[08:37] <timotimo> seems like dot -Tx11 somehow managed to put the x server in a state where it caused kwin and the plasma shell to continuously reboot its gpu-accelerated graphics subsystem

[09:58] <timotimo> is the rec_depth field even correct?

[10:06] <timotimo> like, when i limit to calls entries with a rec depth below 10, i still get a crazy amount of stuff

[10:09] <timotimo> limited to 5, the amount is still 73k

[10:18] <timotimo> huh, is thread_junction supposed to be recursive like that, i wonder

[10:21] <timotimo> postcircumfix:<[ ]> and thread_junction both appear at a big amount of different depths in the call graph

[11:00] *** geekosaur joined
[11:20] <MasterDuke_> timotimo: i think rec_depth is correct, but it may have been messed up with the recent changes (assuming you're talking about the sql output)

[11:21] <MasterDuke_> you could do a json profile and add a printf in the qt viewer to confirm they're the same

[13:02] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: maybe i'm misunderstanding rec_depth

[13:05] <timotimo> http://hack.p6c.org/~timo/rec_depth_errors.txt

[13:06] <timotimo> if there was a consistent difference, that'd be fine

[13:07] <MasterDuke_> how are you calculating expected vs got?

[13:08] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/c27778f00b62faebeee528502ac0f0c2

[13:08] <timotimo> it doesn't make sense to me that so many nodes would have rec_depth of 0

[13:11] <timotimo> oh, rec_depth only counts how often the same routine has already been on the stack above the entry in question?

[13:13] <MasterDuke_> think so. it's needed to get inclusive time right

[13:13] <timotimo> ah

[13:15] <timotimo> yeah, that makes sense now

[13:29] <timotimo> oh gott diese cops

[13:29] <timotimo> auf der letzten seite

[13:29] <timotimo> "letzte seite"

[13:46] <timotimo> another mischan, hah

[13:46] <timotimo> i now have little "progress bars" floating next to the edges

[13:51] <MasterDuke_> of your brownian thing?

[13:51] <timotimo> nah, the brownian thing is impossible

[13:51] <MasterDuke_> impossible?

[13:52] <timotimo> http://hack.p6c.org/~timo/forestfire_callgraph_2.svg

[13:52] <timotimo> the svg file is 50 megabytes big

[13:52] <timotimo> i can't view it with anything, i don't think

[13:52] <MasterDuke_> convert to png/jpg and crush it?

[13:53] <timotimo> hm.

[13:53] <timotimo> what program would do that? can convert do that?

[13:54] <timotimo> ah convert uses inkscape to convert svg to png

[13:54] <MasterDuke_> ffmpeg might also

[13:55] <timotimo> now how do i get the values for "out of the inclusive time of the parent of the routine i'm looking at right now, what percentage does this routine take in its inclusive time"

[13:56] <MasterDuke_> btw, all the progress bars look the same to me. or is that why you just asked that question?

[13:56] <timotimo> yeah :)

[13:57] <timotimo> convert: memory allocation failed `../dotrender.svg' @ error/svg.c/ReadSVGImage/2999.

[13:57] <MasterDuke_> i think you would need a subquery for that

[14:00] <timotimo> fortunately, that's quite possible

[14:01] <MasterDuke_> we have the technology!

[14:01] <timotimo> wait, why can't i just use the inclusive time column here?

[14:09] *** geekosaur joined
[14:16] <timotimo> nice, i've got a pretty for you

[14:17] <timotimo> i uploaded it under the same filename

[14:22] <MasterDuke_> very cool

[14:44] <timotimo> thx

[14:57] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: can has sql help?

[14:58] <MasterDuke_> can offer one-handed help right now

[14:58] <timotimo> oh, i think i got it

[15:06] <timotimo> now i've gotta see why my values aren't right

[15:10] <MasterDuke_> two hands free for a bit, still working on it?

[15:10] <timotimo> i'll paste you something

[15:11] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/c27778f00b62faebeee528502ac0f0c2

[15:11] <timotimo> line 61 is where i'm trying to get a percentage for the time spent inside a routine itself, rather than spent in the child routines

[15:12] <timotimo> oh

[15:12] <timotimo> i think i should just have used the exclusive field and compared it against the inclusive field

[15:12] <timotimo> m)

[15:13] <timotimo> that at least gives me only values between 0 and 1

[15:13] <timotimo> but sometimes nodes that have no children at all get 100% and sometimes 0%

[15:13] <MasterDuke_> hm, you're not adjusting inclusive time based on rec_depth?

[15:13] <timotimo> aha got it

[15:14] <timotimo> i am not

[15:14] <timotimo> because now i am really interested in the inclusive time of every piece of the call graph

[15:14] <timotimo> anyway, the subquery can just go away

[15:15] <MasterDuke_> ah, right

[15:16] <timotimo> er

[15:16] <timotimo> that's smart

[15:16] <timotimo> http://hack.p6c.org/~timo/forestfire_callgraph_3.svg

[15:18] <MasterDuke_> what are some many of the bars in the boxes full?

[15:18] <MasterDuke_> *so many

[15:19] <MasterDuke_> oh, those are leaf nodes

[15:20] <timotimo> yup, next step will be to throw the boxes out of those

[15:22] <timotimo> oh, but how to do that

[15:22] <timotimo> i might need a subquery for that, actually

[15:25] <timotimo> refresh, it now has entry counts on the edges

[15:27] <timotimo> f5 again and it'll have tooltips telling you what file a routine is from

[15:34] <timotimo> F5 again for straight lines

[15:55] <MasterDuke_> nice

[16:29] <timotimo> and with a _4, as said on #perl6, you get stuff sorted by inclusive time

[16:29] <timotimo> this was a fun distraction

[16:29] <timotimo> not even what i wanted to do :D

[16:30] <timotimo> because for big callgraphs, dot will have some serious difficulty generating the target image

[16:40] <timotimo> what i really wanted was a TUI with a tree that you could explore

[16:40] <timotimo> it'd be a lot like the callgraph tab in the html profiler

[22:28] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: could it be i'm confusing caller_id and callee_id?

[22:28] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: because i'm infinite looping while trying to get children because i get the same object over and over %)

[22:30] <timotimo> or maybe sorting is bad

[22:32] <timotimo> yeah, i think it was because i didn't sort right
