[04:44] <samcv> i'm going to add in Bidi_Matching_Bracket and Bidi_Bracket_Type

[04:44] <samcv> at least Bidi_Matching_Bracket is going to depend on Bidi_Mirroring_glyph and Bidi_Bracket_Type. atm we don't have any properties that are derived from other properties, so working on getting that to work, so we can reduce the amount of stuff we have to store
