[09:20] <dogbert17_> o/ timotimo, had your morning coffee yet?

[09:22] <timotimo> i don't drink coffee :)

[09:22] <dogbert17_> tea?

[09:22] <timotimo> not very often

[09:22] <dogbert17_> Red Bull :)

[09:22] <timotimo> hardly ever

[09:23] <dogbert17_> how do you manage to stay sharp then ?

[09:23] * dogbert17_ wouldn't survive without coffee

[09:23] <timotimo> have you ever seen me be sharp? :D

[09:24] <dogbert17_> sure

[09:26] <dogbert17_> timotimo: have you also noticed that [Tux]'s code have gotten slower recently?

[09:27] <timotimo> i didn't pay close attention, but i noticed it went below 5 and then above 5 again

[09:35] <dogbert17_> I wonder why, perhaps time to profile again

[09:48] <dogbert17_> this code takes 5.6 s on my machine: 'for i in $(seq 1 10000); do echo 'hello,","," ",world,"!"'; done > /tmp/hello.csv; time perl6 -Ilib -MText::CSV test-t.pl </tmp/hello.csv'

[10:55] <timotimo> aaw, annotations on spesh bytecode instructions have had 32bits of payload data until now ... but i want to introduce a filename/linenumber annotation, which requires 64bit

[11:00] *** domidumont joined

[11:29] *** AlexDaniel joined
[11:33] <timotimo> i could also just keep the original pc around, then i could grab the line number out when i actually need it. though i need to walk the annotations data anyway to find the right instructions that actually have annotations for 'em

[11:37] <timotimo> fantastic, got something that seems to work

[11:43] <timotimo> oh, snap. now i'll have to measure more precisely how many slots have to go into the line_report_store :\

[12:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/line_coverage_precision: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3f2d62ffb7

[12:35] <timotimo> i imagine entries in the list it uses to hold the nodes to visit might be smaller than stack frames for the recursive function

[12:35] <timotimo> but there's some overhead from reallocing and such

[12:37] <timotimo> huh

[12:43] <MasterDuke_> btw, speaking of telemetry. i know where i saw it demoed before. in one of jonathan blow's videos he was using it to talk about the performance of his compiler. the view was pretty slick

[12:44] <timotimo> and yeah, the real secret sauce isn't in what we've got in moar now

[12:45] <MasterDuke_> oh also, i get a lot of warnings when compiling moar

[12:46] <timotimo> oh yeah

[12:46] <timotimo> now that i put the header file in it actually knows what the first argument to the interval ops is

[12:46] <timotimo> i should def fix that

[12:46] <MasterDuke_> there are also a couple printf format ones

[13:06] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c280bad6c7

[13:07] <timotimo> let's see it catch up

[13:10] <timotimo> it's a bit problematic that travis won't tell us up front when things get borken. i wonder why that is?

[13:10] <timotimo> did we mess up the irc report options or something?

[13:10] <MasterDuke_> yeah, it hasn't reported in a while

[13:11] <timotimo> it could have told me my code won't compile

[13:11] <timotimo> also, i'm confused: why did it compile locally even though there was a for(unsigned int i;...) in the code?

[13:11] <timotimo> i thought we put a --std in our makefile?

[13:12] <MasterDuke_> nope

[13:12] <timotimo> huh.

[13:12] <timotimo> i'll do some errands-y stuff instead of watching travis do its thing …

[13:15] <MasterDuke_> build/check.mk.in:53:   gcc -fsyntax-only -std=c99 -Werror -Wall -Wextra $(NOGCC:%=-Wno-%) $(CFLAGS) $(CINCLUDES) $<

[13:15] <timotimo> huh

[13:15] <timotimo> okay, AFK for now

[13:16] <timotimo> but how does travis get the c89 one and we get the c99 one?!

[13:17] <timotimo> i think i need someone to replace the __ATOMIC stuff with stuff from libatomic_ops

[13:47] <timotimo> at least i'm getting travis emails

[13:48] <MasterDuke_> oh yeah, i just started getting them the past day or two

[13:49] <timotimo> we might want to consider removing the "install latest llvm" stuff when we're setting CC=gcc

[13:49] <timotimo> or maybe only do that for coverage

[13:59] <timotimo> that wasn't so hard ...

[18:05] <spebern> no problem, there certainly are more important things

[18:06] <spebern> are there any plans of having arrays with fixed size/shape?

[18:34] <samcv> so many failing modules jnthn :(

[18:35] <samcv> uh

[18:35] <samcv> 327?

[18:35] <jnthn> samcv: I suspect in some cases the bit rot goes back over a year

[18:35] <Zoffix> Also: how of them haven't been updated since before Dec 2015 :)

[18:35] <Zoffix> *how many

[18:35] <samcv> go here and search http://hack.p6c.org/~samcv/install_log_live.txt  “»» (FAIL”

[18:36] <samcv> or timeout works too i guess. but for ones only failing

[18:36] <samcv> well. still we shouldn't have failing modules in any cose

[18:36] <samcv> it's a bad experience

[18:36] <Zoffix> Yes, people do crack jokes about half of our ecosystem being broken

[18:36] <samcv> it... may not be wrong

[18:36] <TimToady> there's a joke about omelets in there somewhere

[18:37] <samcv> they're delicious?

[18:37] <samcv> :P

[18:37] <TimToady> I do wonder what percentage of those modules are broken due to reliance on untested "features"

[18:38] <TimToady> it's quite likely that we were right back at the beginning when we said we'd eventually need about 4 times as many spectests as we have...

[18:39] <Zoffix> I see a lot of failures with  ===> Install [FAIL] ...  ... no such file or directory

[18:39] <Zoffix> And just checked one of the modules and it has .pm in the provides META, but the actual file is .pm6

[18:39] <geekosaur> ...showing your age? I don't think I;ve seen that saying in anything newer than the 30s

[18:39] <geekosaur> :p

[18:40] <TimToady> my 30s were a long time ago, fershure

[18:41] <timotimo> huh, 30 seconds ago?

[18:42] <geekosaur> maybe he's moving at 0.9999c

[18:42] <Zoffix> $ grep -FR '===> Install [FAIL]' install_log_live.txt  | wc -l

[18:42] <Zoffix> 25

[18:42] <Zoffix> I bet 24 of those are due to incorrect `provides` sections in META

[18:43] <timotimo> feels good when so many dists have probably not been installed once :)

[18:43] <samcv> i count 327

[18:43] <samcv> using '»» (FAIL'

[18:43] <samcv> instead of ===> Install [FAIL]

[18:44] <samcv> way more than 25 failing modules

[18:44] <Zoffix> My hypothesis holds so far :) Will send PRs fixing all `provides` in MEAT

[18:44] <Zoffix> *META

[18:45] <samcv> yes that will be very good :) anything that makes less fail is very double plus good

[18:48] <samcv> YES

[18:49] <samcv> is this to speed up our builds?

[18:51] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to Util.

[18:51] <jnthn> I use the pun "ulti-matt" to remember which is which :P

[18:51] <Zoffix> :D

[18:58] <Zoffix> heh, oops, one of the failures is my module RT::REST::Client. I didn't even know it was failing

[18:58] <Zoffix> I... didn't even know I made a Perl 6 RT::REST::Client :S

[18:59] <Zoffix> "Latest commit d6eba88 on Jul 31, 2016"... that was before I quit drinking...

[19:00] <jnthn> Does that explain making an RT::REST::Client in the first place, or forgetting about it? :)

[19:00] <Zoffix> I guess forgetting about it :)

[19:01] <timotimo> was probably for perl6.fail?

[19:03] <Zoffix> Probably, but I ended up writing it in Perl 5. Forget why

[19:03] <Zoffix> I guess Mojolicious

[19:04] <timotimo> ok, mayhaps

[19:24] <Zoffix> I lied. I submitted what I could, but this is boring. Dists with INSTALL FAIL that I didn't look at https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/8bc1bc2ad6b9eb96a2331a3cf7759a5d
