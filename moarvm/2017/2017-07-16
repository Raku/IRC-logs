[03:56] <yoleaux> 15 Jul 2017 21:48Z <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: For release stuff, there are these docs and posts https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/release_guide_automated.md https://rakudo.party/post/Perl6-Fail-Release-Robots-And-Other-Goodies

[03:56] <yoleaux> 15 Jul 2017 21:51Z <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: if you wanted to run the bot on your own system, would be good to practice with test repos. I recall it being a PITA to get it going due to stuff that needs to be installed (the rakudo.party post should detail it). Bot's repo is https://github.com/zoffixznet/na and perl6.fail repo is in https://github.com/zoffixznet/r6 On perl6.fail you can go to https://perl6.fail/release/stats and it'll

[19:23] <MasterDuke> i don't remember, how do i tell what op is causing a routine to not be JITted?

[19:24] <MasterDuke> i have a jit log with BAILs in it, but am not sure which are to blame

[20:15] *** lizmat joined
[21:30] <timotimo> you have to search through for the name of the frame and then walk downwards until you see a BAIL or a new frame being created, MasterDuke

[21:52] <jnthn> That or find the BAIL and walk upwards :)

[21:56] <timotimo> right

[21:57] <timotimo> you can grep -v the lines about appending ops and the other ones

[21:57] <timotimo> that makes it much easier to see
