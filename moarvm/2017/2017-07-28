[00:12] <timotimo> heh, the moarvm.org repo already has the fixes, but the website itself is still on an older revision

[01:24] <samcv> hmm i'm getting a crash when i call MVM_free on something i've MVM_realloc'd

[01:24] <samcv> anybody know of any gotcha's that could maybe cause that? it only crashes on the free

[01:37] <samcv> An interesting article on use of conditionals http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2016/02/dont-use-greater-than-sign-in.html

[01:37] <samcv> i've since taken its advice and now only use the less than or less than or equal to sign when programming. it's resulted in much clearer and consistently typed conditionals

[01:42] <samcv> ok so i used realloc(ptr, 0) to free it and that probbaly works from what the documentation on realloc says

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Zero owner of a stack frame also.

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: The flags being zero is a sufficient test for whether the frame is a

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: stack frame or not when we know it's certainly a frame. However, when

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: we have an unknown collectable, the fully zeroed flags would also be

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: a normal object. The temp roots mechanism thus uses a zero owner to

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: identify this situation. Ensure the owner is zeroed.

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/82c282efda

[10:34] <timotimo> oh i thought zeroed flags would be "not a normal object"

[10:34] <jnthn> No, I forgot that we do that :)

[10:34] <jnthn> We do it 'cus it means object allocation never has to set any flags :)

[10:34] <jnthn> So the common case is cheap

[10:34] <timotimo> ah

[10:35] <jnthn> An alternative to save, like, 1 instruction, would be to introduce a flag set on stack frames on the call stack

[10:35] <jnthn> Instead of 0

[10:38] <jnthn> spectest looks happy with GC stressing

[10:39] <jnthn> So hopefully that nails it

[10:42] <jnthn> One upshot of MVMStaticFrame having spesh stats hung off of it is that it often ends up needing to be marked every single collection

[10:43] <jnthn> Well, that's not quite true

[10:43] <jnthn> But since spesh stats sample values, it means a lot more frames end up in the inter-gen roots

[10:44] <jnthn> We thus spend 2.32% of CORE.setting compilation cycles in gc_mark of a static frame

[10:45] <jnthn> Since there's a load of stuff to mark

[10:45] <timotimo> oh, hmm

[10:45] <timotimo> right

[10:46] <jnthn> Static frame's gc_mark is thus called 35 million times

[10:49] <timotimo> the sampled values never get stale, do they? like, we don't throw out stuff that never gets used any more in the future?

[10:49] <jnthn> There's a throwing out mechanism

[10:49] <jnthn> If the stats weren't updated for N spesh runs then they are thrown away

[10:49] <timotimo> that's good

[10:49] <samcv> is create in array that has as many elements as the longest sequence of codepoints. i'll put codepoints into this array. 0, 1, 2 then wrap 0, 1, 2. so it just continuously puts codepoits in there

[10:50] <samcv> always storing only 3 to prevent having to store too much for really long strings

[10:50] <timotimo> oh so like a ring buffer?

[10:50] <jnthn> I guess we could have an MVMSpeshStats repr

[10:50] <samcv> then when it finds a mismatch it puts the three codepoits which might be 2, 0, 1 for example since it wraps continuously

[10:50] <samcv> yeah

[10:50] <samcv> and then pass that through to the collation function

[10:50] <jnthn> Just to hang the stats off

[10:51] <jnthn> And then that'd end up in the inter-gen set

[10:51] *** brrt joined
[10:51] <samcv> right now i do tricks so i don't have to go the whole length of the strig before starting collation. since how the UCA works: primary_1, primary_2 .... primary_n, secondary_1 etc

[10:51] <jnthn> Alternatively, we could just keep an array of MVMSpeshStats ** in the instance and just store an index in the MVMStaticFrame

[10:51] <samcv> is how the ordering of them go. so if you just niavely did that you'd have to go the whole length of the string and that'd be no fun

[10:52] <samcv> so need to now solve how to not have to push them starting from the very beginning of the string

[10:52] <jnthn> And have the throwing away done by index

[10:52] <jnthn> And re-use indices

[10:53] <timotimo> that'll naturally throw out old stuff

[10:55] <jnthn> It's a bit tricky to reason about compared to just having a spesh stats repr though

[10:56] <jnthn> And we'd still need to make sure that if a static frame gets collected then we throw out the stats

[10:58] <jnthn> And it gets tricky if two threads are doing GC and want to toss stuff out and add the indices to an "unused" array

[10:58] <jnthn> Then we need a lock on taht

[10:58] <jnthn> And urgh

[10:58] <jnthn> So I suspect the stats holder object is the way to go

[11:00] <jnthn> I wonder if we should hang *all* spesh stuff off such an object

[11:01] <jnthn> Tempting.

[11:02] <jnthn> Then for frames that are never called at all (which in a typical program is most of them) we save 24 bytes (64-bit)

[11:02] <jnthn> And the MVMStaticFrame itself will never be forced into the inter-gen roots list

[11:03] <jnthn> (The most of them meaning all of the CORE.setting frames we don't call)

[11:05] <timotimo> that doesn't sound bad; is it problematic to install the spesh object in a threaded environment?

[11:06] <jnthn> I was figuring we'd allocate it on first call

[11:06] <jnthn> When we do all the other static frame setup work

[11:06] <jnthn> Which we do under lock

[11:06] <jnthn> So it's safe

[11:07] <jnthn> It's an extra indirection to reach the arg guards is all

[11:07] <jnthn> But when we're paying so much in the static frame gc_mark...

[11:07] <timotimo> OK

[11:10] <jnthn> Yeah, I think that's a good bet

[11:10] <jnthn> And I can move things bit by bit

[11:10] <jnthn> So, will do that. But...after lunch :)

[13:13] <nine> I think unused code is actually quite common even outside the setting. Think about all those times you use some module just for one of its gazillion functions. Or about loading a full DBIx::Class schema with all table definitions (and custom methods) just for inserting some entries in a single table in a script.

[13:19] <jnthn> Yeah, good point :)

[13:19] <jnthn> Saving 24 bytes off each of those could quickly add up :)

[13:20] <nine> I guess that's also true for all the generated accessor methods?

[13:21] <jnthn> Yup

[13:24] <brrt> jnthn; the spesh guard tree thingy… do we ever update that as more specializations come in?

[13:24] <timotimo> yeah

[13:25] <timotimo> we use the "free at safepoint" mechanism to make replacing it safe

[13:25] <brrt> so, you mentioned at some point that we should JIT compile that

[13:25] <jnthn> We update it by copying it and tweaking and then installing the new one as just a pointer update

[13:25] <brrt> i'm guessing that at the point we are compiling a JIT frame, we at least have the current version of that tree

[13:26] <jnthn> And yeah, safepoint thing as timo mentioned it

[13:26] <brrt> so we can compile a new tree into the latest JIT frame

[13:26] <jnthn> At the moment we delete the tree after

[13:26] <jnthn> oops

[13:26] <jnthn> update the tree after

[13:26] <brrt> hmmm

[13:26] <jnthn> But there's no need for that

[13:26] <jnthn> It's just the way it is

[13:26] <jnthn> I can't think of a reason why we can't re-order

[13:26] <jnthn> I mean, we can't *publish* the new tree until the compilation is done

[13:27] <jnthn> But we can produce it and have it avaialble earlier

[13:27] <brrt> i'm asking mostly because if we'd allocate it separately, we need at least a whole page for it

[13:27] <brrt> whereas if we do it in the compiled frame, we can append it after

[13:27] <jnthn> ah

[13:27] <jnthn> True

[13:28] <jnthn> Though we lose the ability to free older ones

[13:28] <jnthn> But still, it's probably very little code, so...

[13:28] <brrt> why would we lose that?

[13:29] <jnthn> Because we still need the JITted candidate

[13:29] <jnthn> I mean, most of the time it's a non-issue as probably there's space left over in the page we put JIT output on anyway

[16:38] *** robertle joined
[18:41] * jnthn went home but his brane kept working on how we'll take spesh forward anyway...

[18:43] <jnthn> Basically, we cheated really hard on aliasing so far. We presumed that just because we guarded a Scalar and it contained something then it would continue to contain that. This didn't really work so we ended up with a "block it if we see a call", which is both too strong (most calls immediately decont their args) and too weak (we don't know the Scalar isn't aliased elsewhere, and being touched by another thread)

[18:43] <lizmat> jnthn: a datapoint: "my @a = (^10000)>>.Str" with --profile reliably segfaults for me, with ^1000 it doesn't

[18:43] <jnthn> lizmat: That's not really related to what I'm thinking about now :)

[18:44] <jnthn> But maybe you meant a general thing that wants a look at :)

[18:44] <lizmat> true, it wasn't related to it in any way...

[18:44] <jnthn> Ah :)

[18:44] <lizmat> sorry to have interrupted your train of thought

[18:44] <jnthn> OK, not sure why that'd be; could you RT it so it doesn't get lost?

[18:45] <lizmat> will do

[18:45] <jnthn> Thanks

[18:46] <jnthn> Anyway, doing a more proper alias analysis is useful for cutting down on our GC. But we kinda have a problem in that almost everything in Perl 6 is a call. All operators are multi-dispatch. And we pass them scalar containers.

[18:46] <jnthn> Anyway, I had the idea a while back that spesh could calculate frame-level facts, and attach them to the spesh candidate

[18:47] <jnthn> Included "we always decont this straight away" for each object arg, and later richer escape info. Plus "we always return type T"

[18:48] <jnthn> The other thing I just realized is that our facts need to become lattices like:

[18:49] <jnthn> Morphic (?)

[18:49] <jnthn> /    .... \

[18:49] <jnthn> Int        Str

[18:49] <jnthn> \         /

[18:50] <jnthn> Unknown (?)

[18:50] <jnthn> Uh, crappy IRC drawing :)

[18:51] *** zakharyas joined
[18:51] <jnthn> So in a case like my $i = 0; while $i < 100 { $i++ }

[18:51] <jnthn> We can do an abstract interpretation

[18:52] <jnthn> Actually that's an awkward example, let's do

[18:52] <jnthn> So in a case like my $i = 0; while $i < 100 { $i = $i + 1 }

[18:52] <jnthn> So here the PHI at the entrance to the loop body has $i as containing an Int

[18:53] <jnthn> We then say "OK, if we presume that we call the $i + 1 candidate we'd be allowed to, what'd it give us?" and we know from the frame facts it's an Int

[18:53] <jnthn> Which then gets stored into $i

[18:54] <jnthn> Then we have to join our content model and at the join point both say Int and Int so we stay on Int

[18:54] <jnthn> If they instead could differ then we'd end up at Morphic

[18:54] <jnthn> Which may have impacts on other things

[18:54] <jnthn> So we'd iterate to a fixed point

[18:55] <jnthn> Which the lattices promise we'll reach

[18:55] <jnthn> And only then would be go and do the various transformations

[18:58] * lizmat is afk again&

[19:01] <jnthn> Anyways, I think that gives me enough of an idea of how to move forward that I can relax and enjoy my weekend now :P

[19:08] <[Coke]> \o/

[21:17] <timotimo> yo brrt

[21:17] <timotimo> how's you?

[21:17] <brrt> happy that it's weekend

[21:17] <brrt> how are you?

[21:17] <timotimo> i'm okay

[21:18] <timotimo> a bit frustrated by my continuing lack of productivity

[21:22] *** praisethemoon joined
[21:22] <[Coke]> I feel your pain.

[21:23] <[Coke]> (about, to be clear, my own productivity)

[21:28] <mst> similar

[21:28] <mst> too much staring at an empty editor

[22:02] *** dogbert2 joined
[22:02] <dogbert2> there's at least one bug still lurking in the shadows

[22:04] <timotimo> crashbug?

[22:04] <dogbert2> yes

[22:04] <dogbert2> read all about it :) https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/3cc123e33a87a66984ae8752eee4fb3c

[22:12] <samcv> woo my ring buffer at least seems to work. now to run tests on it

[22:12] <samcv> though most of the unicode tests are all really short so won't see any difference there. but it shouldn't matter if i chop off the front

[22:15] <samcv> and also having the ringbuffer allows me to break any resulting collation ties easily. i already know which string would be greater or less than the other if broken by a codepoint tie

[22:15] <samcv> atm i have it go back through the string again from start to finish in case the collation values are the same. now i can just store that value and return it if the collation values end up the same

[22:17] <timotimo> that sounds like good news

[22:18] <samcv> yep :)

[22:19] <timotimo> dogbert2: does it trigger reliably? did you set anything up like a smaller nursery?

[22:21] <timotimo> i think i see what's wrong

[22:21] <dogbert2> timotimo: not reliable, I had to run with a small nursery but it still doesn't trigger every time

[22:23] <dogbert2> I ran with '#define MVM_NURSERY_SIZE (32768 * 8)'

[22:23] <timotimo> right

[22:24] <timotimo> the spesh thread doesn't know to wait while the threadcontext gets destroyed while it's joined

[22:24] <timotimo> so it blindly reaches for where there used to be a thread to fetch some log data

[22:24] <timotimo> and bam

[22:26] <samcv> anybody know if i'm wrong that when you MVM_malloc something, and then use MVM_realloc, that you can't just call MVM_free on it?

[22:26] <samcv> because if i had some allocated memory that had been resized with MVM_realloc, mvm would crash when i ran MVM_free

[22:27] <timotimo> didn't you say you realloced it to 0?

[22:27] <samcv> i did

[22:27] <timotimo> i'd say that the implementation treats that as if you had used free on it

[22:27] <timotimo> and another free would be explosive

[22:27] <samcv> well not quite

[22:28] <samcv> timotimo, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/collation-arrays/src/strings/unicode_ops.c#L62-L68 this is what i do now

[22:28] <samcv> after reading the documentation for realloc more closely

[22:28] <timotimo> huh, that's strange?

[22:29] <samcv> it says it may return NULL or a pointer suitable to be freed

[22:29] <samcv> wondering if we do this other places in moarvm where we use realloc?

[22:29] <timotimo> but why do you realloc to 0 in the first place?

[22:29] <samcv> because otherwise it crashes moarvm

[22:30] <timotimo> o_O

[22:30] <samcv> yep

[22:30] <timotimo> valgrind should tell you why exactly, i'd expect

[22:30] <samcv> it prints out a big stacktrace

[22:31] <timotimo> like it'll tell you if it had already been freed, or if it's not a pointer that was returned by any *alloc

[22:39] <timotimo> it looks like we never actually root an MVMThreadContext

[22:39] <timotimo> we clearly just use the status to tell when it may be destroyed

[22:46] <dogbert2> aha

[22:48] <timotimo> i'm not sure what the right step forwards is

[22:55] *** praisethemoon joined
[22:56] <timotimo> dogbert2: want to open a RT about the join issue?

[22:57] <timotimo> something along the lines of "the spesh worker doesn't cope with a tc being freed while it's working on data contributed by it"

[23:10] <jnthn> timotimo: Is that profiler patch for the profiler bug lizmat mentioned earlier?

[23:21] <samcv> jnthn, can i make a proposal for MVM_string_compare?

[23:22] <jnthn> samcv: sure

[23:22] <samcv> currently it isn't predicable when synthetics are involved. we don't need to expand most synthetics, but only one. i.e. if the different grapheme between the two is a synthetic, we should return based on codepoint instead of the synthetic number

[23:22] <samcv> all other synthetics we encounter just get left aloe

[23:22] <samcv> *alone

[23:23] <samcv> so shouldn't slow it down except a very tiny amount

[23:25] <jnthn> Well, it's predictable if you consider it a codepoint level operation... :)

[23:25] <jnthn> oh wait

[23:25] <jnthn> It ain't

[23:25] <samcv> well. if synthetics get added in a different order then it will have a different response

[23:25] <samcv> yep

[23:25] <jnthn> It's scanning graphemes

[23:25] <jnthn> d'oh

[23:25] <jnthn> Yeah, it isn't doing what I thought it was doing

[23:26] <jnthn> I dunno, maybe the easiest way to do it is with codepoint iters...

[23:26] <samcv> yeah. we save time not doing a codepoint iterator, which is good. it's not needed except if the deciding codepoint is a synthetic

[23:26] <samcv> then it matters

[23:26] <jnthn> Or the spiritual equivalent

[23:26] <jnthn> Yeah

[23:26] <samcv> codepoint iterator won't be as fast and isn't needed

[23:26] <jnthn> Well, it depends :)

[23:26] <samcv> we can do a graphemecodepoint iterator the thing i just created a few days back

[23:26] <samcv> but only if one of the deciding codepoints is a synthetic

[23:26] <jnthn> Codepoint iter is faster if you've strandy stuff going on

[23:27] <samcv> wait why?

[23:27] <jnthn> 'cus it doesn't have to re-scan the strands to figure out which one has the grapheme you want

[23:27] <samcv> codepoint iterators are more work

[23:27] <samcv> since it has to iterate each grapheme

[23:27] <samcv> and we *don't* want to iterate by codepoint

[23:28] <samcv> we want to iterate by grapheme and oly compare one that differs

[23:28] <samcv> otherwise the strings will become unaligned

[23:28] <samcv> if one grapheme expands more than another

[23:28] <samcv> oh wait

[23:28] <samcv> that makes no sense

[23:28] <samcv> hah

[23:28] <jnthn> I don't think that could ever cause a different result

[23:28] <jnthn> :)

[23:28] <samcv> well it won't become misaliged

[23:28] <jnthn> 'cus we return as soon as we see the diference

[23:28] <samcv> but it will have to expand graphemes for no reason

[23:29] <jnthn> But yeah, agree

[23:29] <samcv> and codepoint iterator is just a grapheme + codhepoint iterator. it iterates both

[23:29] <jnthn> My point wasn't so much about codepoint iter so much as about grapheme iterator and codepoint iterator in general

[23:29] <timotimo> jnthn: i stumbled upon a null deref and fixed it, but forgot to push for hours. i don't know if it also fixes what liz found

[23:29] <jnthn> Which is that MVM_string_get_grapheme_at_nocheck is cheap when it is just a buffer string and you can fixed index.

[23:30] <timotimo> damn, without the patch it doesn't crash either

[23:30] <samcv> oh

[23:30] <samcv> ah

[23:30] <jnthn> But when you've a string of strands it might have to look through 10 strands to see their lengths to know that the grapheme it wants is actually in the 11th one, for example

[23:30] <samcv> yeah

[23:30] <samcv> good point. so we should use a grapheme iterator probably

[23:30] <jnthn> Yeah

[23:31] <jnthn> I think what I wanted to say is that we probably want the semantics we'd get if we used codepoint iter

[23:31] <jnthn> Not that using codepoint iter was the best way to implement it

[23:31] <samcv> oh. wait how does codepoint iter have different semantics to grapheme iterator?

[23:31] <jnthn> Though maybe what you're suggesting is subtly different

[23:32] <samcv> the codepoint iterator is just a grapheme iterator but if it's synthetic iterates by codepoint then once done with that synthetic grabs next from the grapheme iterator

[23:32] <jnthn> iiuc, you're saying that when we see a synthetic, than we'll look at the codepoints it would conssit of

[23:32] <samcv> yeah

[23:32] <jnthn> Which is I think going to give about the same results, but faster, as if we just used the codepoint iter

[23:32] <timotimo> it was a bit strange to me that the title said "crash with --profile" but the examples in the body didn't have --profile

[23:32] <samcv> so we don't waste time expanding synthetics that are going to be equal

[23:32] <samcv> yeah

[23:33] <jnthn> Yeah, I think we're agreeing :)

[23:33] <samcv> cool :-)

[23:33] <jnthn> I fully agree the semantics today are weird. I didn't realize it did that.

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: 5fc8dce423 | (Samantha McVey)++ | src/strings/unicode_ops.c

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: Implement a ring buffer so only different codepoints need processing

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays:

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: The ring buffers hold the exact number of codepoints which comprise the longest

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: sequence of codepoints which map to its own collation keys in the Unicode

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: Collation Algorithm. As of Unicode 9.0 this number was 3.

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays:

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: This also allows us to return based on codepoint based on the determination

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: we found using the ring buffer

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/collation-arrays: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5fc8dce423

[23:38] <samcv> also we should make sure to use MVMuint64 or MVMint64 for every "i" we use iterating a string. since if the string is the 2**32 long, then i will roll back to 0. at least i assume

[23:38] <samcv> or maybe i'm wrong

[23:39] <timotimo> what the hell, it crashes with that exact number, but not with a higher number

[23:39] <timotimo> but with the patch cherry-picked it doesn't crash immediately

[23:40] <jnthn> samcv: MVMuint32 would be save since the grapheme count is currently a 32-bit number

[23:41] <jnthn> samcv: We could decide we want to support strings of more than 4GB I guess... :)

[23:41] <samcv> 32bit signed?

[23:41] <timotimo> didn't someone just upgrade that for us?

[23:41] <jnthn> I thought it was unsinged

[23:41] <samcv> so it can be max 2**31 ?

[23:41] <samcv> yeah it is unsigned

[23:42] <jnthn> But we index from 0 so a for loop up to the int max value is safe?

[23:42] <samcv> for (i = 0; i < str_len; i++) { } ah you're right ok so

[23:42] <samcv> i think that sholud be fine

[23:42] <samcv> since i would == str_len and then it'd end the loop

[23:42] <jnthn> We could go 64-bit

[23:42] <jnthn> Yeah

[23:42] <samcv> but str_len = 2**32 -1  then?

[23:42] <jnthn> Don't know anybody has hit the limit yet though :)

[23:43] <jnthn> Yeah

[23:43] <samcv> i can do 'a' x 2 ** 32 - 2

[23:43] <samcv> but not - 1

[23:43] <jnthn> But when doing things like finding the lenght of a join/concat we should really use 64-bit

[23:44] <jnthn> *length

[23:44] <samcv> yeah

[23:44] <jnthn> Though if we used 64-bit everywhere we're fine. It's just such a ridiculously big number ;)

[23:50] <samcv> jnthn, i'm also going to make it so if all the codepoints in the synthetic match, it goes based on which has the most codepoints

[23:51] <samcv> (in that synthetic)

[23:51] <timotimo> jnthn: got a hot take for "tc gets freed because thread_join but spesh is still working on stuff submitted from it"?

[23:51] <samcv> since that could totally happen

[23:53] <samcv> will come in useful that you can use MVM_string_grapheme_ci on non-synthetics

[23:54] <samcv> i think i used that as well to greatly simplify the code so it wouldn't have to have a huge number of branches
