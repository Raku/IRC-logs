[11:57] <samcv> yhello guys

[11:57] <yoleaux> 19 Oct 2017 20:53Z <AlexDaniel`> samcv: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2017-10-19#i_15327049

[11:57] <samcv> so i volunteered for something :) ok

[11:57] <samcv> oh yes i did

[11:57] <AlexDaniel`> hehe :D

[11:58] <samcv> i've been needing something to do anyway

[11:58] <samcv> releasable6, status

[11:58] <releasable6> samcv, Next release in 1 day and ≈7 hours. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[11:58] <releasable6> samcv, Details: https://gist.github.com/37d496766d04eaa162c794138697e98a

[11:58] <samcv> ok cool

[11:58] <samcv> AlexDaniel`, there's a list right? of things to be done before release?

[11:59] <AlexDaniel`> samcv: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/release_guide.md

[11:59] <samcv> ok cool

[11:59] <AlexDaniel`> samcv: arguably the most time consuming part is the changelog, so that's probably something you want to start with early

[12:00] <samcv> that's what I was thinking too

[12:01] <AlexDaniel`> samcv: if you have any extra resources, there's one thing that can be improved in the process (and in that document) – signing

[12:01] <AlexDaniel`> I've noticed that your commits are signed so it shouldn't be too hard for you

[12:02] <AlexDaniel`> samcv: rakudo release guide talks about signing (e.g. step 16) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/release_guide.pod

[12:03] <AlexDaniel`> but depending on how you have your git set up it may actually happen automatically

[12:03] <AlexDaniel`> then you'll just need to sign the tarball (like in step 17), and that's basically it

[12:05] <samcv> i sign all my commits

[12:06] <samcv> only things i don't sign is doing merges using github

[12:06] <AlexDaniel`> yeah, me too

[13:36] <rba> timotimo: output from "frame 5" and "print c_name": https://gist.github.com/38c6b0898d6dd2fd40076d0fda2ab330

[13:37] <timotimo> ok, what's STABLE(obj)? and what's STABLE(obj)->debug_name?

[13:37] <timotimo> (again with print)

[13:38] <timotimo> i wonder if debug_name is a null pointer and that simply crashes on freebsd whereas it just prints an empty string on other systems?

[13:39] <timotimo> ah, yes, passing NULL there is "officially undefined"

[13:42] <timotimo> i'll build something

[13:42] <rba> timotimo: https://gist.github.com/f9738f74c0358fc45ba61e2f6d22a26b

[13:42] *** Ven joined
[13:43] <timotimo> yup, that's it

[13:43] <timotimo> might be time to run moarvm with ubsan at one point

[13:44] <rba> timotimo: what can I do now?

[13:44] <timotimo> wait for my patch

[13:44] <rba> timotimo: nice!

[14:15] <rba> timotimo: building, stand by

[14:18] <jnthn> timotimo++

[14:19] <timotimo> i wonder if we should probe for "printf null is dangerous" during configure and make this function cheaper otherwise ...

[14:19] <jnthn> Not really; we only use it in error reporting

[14:19] <timotimo> true

[14:20] <timotimo> and spesh dump :P

[14:20] <jnthn> And the compiler knows its builtins, it can strip the check out anyway

[14:20] <jnthn> Oh, maybe not

[14:20] <jnthn> But still...

[14:20] <timotimo> it's not out of the question that gcc might be smart enough for this

[14:20] <timotimo> MSVC, though ... nope :)

[14:21] *** domidumont joined
[14:21] <timotimo> it took me a minute or two to notice sed without /g at the end will only replace stuff once per file :)

[14:22] <ilmari> once per line, no?

[14:22] <timotimo> it seemed to be once per file

[14:24] <rba> timotimo: Confirmed. Error not schowing up any more on Solaris build.

[14:24] <timotimo> cool. now to build rakudo

[14:24] <timotimo> not sure how to handle the mismatch of NaN semantics

[14:24] <rba> Still have the pow_n thing...

[14:24] <timotimo> it's practically harmless

[14:25] <timotimo> only for apps that actually do floating point arithmetic and throw nans around

[14:25] <timotimo> there'll be that kind of program, of course

[14:25] <lizmat> .oO( hmmmm , nans )

[14:25] <timotimo> but we can at least ignore that until rakudo successfully compiles

[14:25] <rba> Ok. will go ahaed...

[15:16] <timotimo> oh? solaris doesn't have ssize_t?

[15:16] <timotimo> oh, interesting, that's not a standard type

[15:31] <timotimo> jnthn: i ran spectest and stresstest and nqp test with debug_name_safe_null; i'm not sure how well the calls are covered, but i assume it's safe to merge now
