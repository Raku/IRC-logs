[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: In ordering registers for function calls, it may occur that there is a

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: cycle in the transfer graph. These cycles must be broken somehow. I had

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: used a stack, but that would cause the cycle to be broken 'in reverse',

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: which would only be a problem if there were more than two registers

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: involved and therefore went unnoticed.

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: The simpler solution - walking the chain of transfers 'backwards' until

[10:53] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: we reach the starting point - is actually correct.

[11:06] <brrt> oh, i see why that breaks MasterDuke

[11:07] <brrt> that's because GT does not yield a register

[11:07] *** Ven_ joined
[11:08] <brrt> but a flag

[11:08] <brrt> and the flag has to be converted to an integer by something called 'FLAGVAL'

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Expr ops like GT, LE, etc. yields 'flags', not register values (meaning

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: on x64 they set bits in the flag register), which can be directly used

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: by conditional operations (e.g. conditional branches). But MoarVM-level

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 'gt_i' ops etc. need to set the result of the comparison into an integer

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: value. The FLAGVAL expr op is intended to intermediate between the two

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/even-moar-jit: representations.
