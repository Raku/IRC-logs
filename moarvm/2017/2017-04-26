[05:50] <timotimo> samcv: i hope it was you who made this :)

[05:50] <yoleaux> 02:39Z <MasterDuke_> timotimo: i'm trying to work on RT #118555 (typed optional array parameters not working), but have hit a roadblock. some comments here: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-04-25#i_14485206 . any suggestions?

[05:50] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=118555

[05:50] <samcv> made what?

[05:50] <samcv> Nuclear::Blackmail_aka_9PM_BST.p6 ?

[05:53] <timotimo> no, the meme image with the high fives :)

[05:54] *** brrt joined
[05:55] <samcv> oh yes

[05:55] <samcv> i made it

[05:55] <samcv> XD

[05:56] <samcv> uh timotimo link me to it again please

[05:56] <brrt> https://i.imgflip.com/1nw9qp.jpg

[05:57] <samcv> i should save it so i don't lose it

[05:57] <samcv> hahaha. yes :)

[05:58] <brrt> pair programming ????

[05:58] <samcv> i saw that picture and it reminded me about the high five thing. so i had to make a macro

[05:58] <samcv> it was on a page as the image as a critism of hype based development or something

[05:59] <samcv> people using the 'newest' and coolest JS frameworks for no good reason other than someone online said it was good on hackernews

[05:59] <samcv> here it is https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22

[06:01] <timotimo> the hype about hype driven development is already over, isn't it?

[06:01] <timotimo> like, it was totally hype like five years ago

[06:01] <samcv> i dunno

[06:01] <timotimo> now it's just a lukewarm sensation

[06:01] <samcv> now it's just normal hype?

[06:01] <samcv> not hype about hype?

[06:01] <samcv> socket.io is a realtime socket implementation

[06:01] <samcv> nobody use brains to think about this. but it sounds cool everybody use it

[06:02] <timotimo> well, it's certainly not worse than all the other realtime socket implementations the javascriptosphere has to offer

[06:04] <samcv> idk if there's any others that claim to be realtime

[06:04] <samcv> oh nvm found one http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/realtime

[06:05] <samcv> i think 'live' is a better word for what they mean

[06:07] <samcv> or asynchronous live sockets

[06:07] <samcv> omg

[06:07] <samcv> Is something missing?

[06:07] <samcv> If you notice something we've missed or could be improved on, please follow this link and submit a pull request to the sails-docs repo. Once we merge it, the changes will be reflected on the website the next time it is deployed.

[06:07] <samcv> idk i don't have the heart

[06:07] <samcv> i already bugged one framework

[06:07] <timotimo> did they actually respond? i haven't looked at the pr in a few days

[06:08] <brrt> indeed, what is a realtime socket? :-o

[06:09] <samcv> here found it in my history https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/2915

[06:12] <samcv> even my not totally fake screenshot attachment knows it's not acutually realtime XD

[06:16] <timotimo> it's like going to a restaurant and ordering the "kosher burger" and it turns out it's a beef burger with bacon and egg on it

[06:16] <timotimo> "you're overreacting. of course everybody knows we don't make kosher burgers here!"

[06:16] <samcv> lol.

[06:17] <samcv> apparently i can never trust any javascript framework anymore

[06:17] <samcv> since that guy says you can't trust any claims they make

[06:17] <samcv> I think you are overreacting, this is JS, nothing is serious here. It's all based on hype and buzz.

[06:19] <timotimo> oh, i can't wait to see things the javascript community presents as "security"

[06:20] <samcv> oh god i have 168 PR open

[06:20] <timotimo> well, the password isn't in plain text, it's actually in a string inside a javascript object that's inside another javascript object. you don't think anybody can read javascript datastructures out of the RAM, do you?

[06:20] <samcv> so many emails

[06:20] <samcv> hahahha

[06:21] <samcv> at least i can type 'NOT spdx' and have it show the other ones. cool

[06:22] <timotimo> "object inside of object is actually *two* layers of security right there

[06:24] <timotimo> " sorry i didn't mean to not close those quotation marks

[06:25] <samcv> argh looking again at github PR i did to try and add Pod6 as a language

[06:25] <samcv> so they don't think there's enough pod6 type files to bother adding it

[06:26] <samcv> so 851 results that are .pod that are per6 pod https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Apod+%22begin+pod%22+%22end+pod%22&type=Code&ref=searchresultsand%20https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Apod+%22begin+pod%22+%22end+pod%22&type=Code&ref=searchresults

[06:26] <timotimo> is that really much? like, we live in a big data world now

[06:26] <samcv> and 1,133 that are .pod6 https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Apod6+NOT+ZTAHCDHURC&type=Code

[06:27] <samcv> in dec 12 it was 53 repositories among 31 users

[06:28] <samcv> at least that's what they argued

[06:28] <timotimo> i don't write pod6 :|

[06:28] <samcv> i write my .pm6 files with pod6

[06:28] <samcv> people would write pod6 much more if github supported in like perl 5 pod

[06:29] <samcv> and rendered it

[06:29] <samcv> idk maybe we need to tell everybody to add .pod6 files to their repos XD

[06:29] <samcv> then go back and ask again

[09:51] <brrt> lol samcv

[09:54] <samcv> idk it could work

[09:54] <samcv> we have 900 modules. gotta see how many unique users though

[09:54] <samcv> apparently they think the number of unique users that use something is most importent

[09:56] <brrt> don't they have like a syntax rendering library? you could always code a renderer yourself and PR it

[09:56] <samcv> we have atom-language-perl6 which is what perl6 things use

[09:56] <samcv> and i did have a PR to use the same thing as perl6 files are highlighted with

[09:56] <samcv> but apparently not enough people use pod6

[09:56] <samcv> so they won't add it

[09:56] <samcv> even though perl6 is already added

[09:57] <samcv> because reasons

[10:01] <samcv> brrt, though i got them to add in .XCompose file highlighting :\ i made a highlighter for it

[10:01] <samcv> and there were enough different users that had XCompose files that they were like ok fine

[10:01] <samcv> not even a language even. just a config filx XD

[10:01] <brrt> hmmm

[10:01] <brrt> well

[10:02] <samcv> https://github.com/samcv/dot-files/blob/master/.XCompose they do look nicer with highlighting now tho :D

[10:02] <brrt> what's the saying again about metrics becoming targets?

[10:02] <samcv> or we convinced someone who works at github to say yes

[10:02] <samcv> idk

[10:02] <brrt> do we know anybody who works at github

[10:02] <brrt> anyway

[10:02] <samcv> tell me the saying

[10:03] <brrt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law

[10:03] <samcv> good thing these XCompose files get highlighting! how could we live without that! too bad pod6 is not important enough

[10:03] <brrt> As soon as a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful metric

[10:03] <brrt> do we have a pod6 syntax highligher?

[10:03] <brrt> *highlighter

[10:03] <samcv> yes.

[10:03] <samcv> atom-language-perl6

[10:03] <brrt> that's the same thing?

[10:03] <samcv> yes it highlights pod

[10:03] <brrt> hmmm

[10:03] <samcv> it doesn't render as html though. which would be the ideal

[10:04] * brrt nods

[10:04] <samcv> i just wanted them to have it highlighted and have .pod files that were perl6 pod and not perl 5 pod

[10:04] <samcv> to not explode the perl 5 pod html renderer

[10:04] <samcv> which they currently do. but. not enough different users and repositories... or something. that have .pod files that are perl 6

[10:04] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[10:05] <samcv> or .pod6 files. or both combined or idk anymore

[10:05] <samcv> i even coded a thing to detect pod5 vs pod6 for them even

[10:05] <samcv> their classifier or whatever they call it.

[10:25] <brrt> hmm, that kind of sucks, indeed

[11:10] <samcv> night o/

[11:11] <brrt> sleep well

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Rename h_vars to H_vars to make haystack vars distinguishable from n_vars

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We use n_graphs and h_graphs or n_cps etc. in many places.

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: h and n are not super easy to distinguish. Go with convention of using

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: a capital H for any uses of haystack and lowercase n for needle.

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This makes it much easier to visually scan code and know which object

[22:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: is which and the likely relative sizes each may be.
