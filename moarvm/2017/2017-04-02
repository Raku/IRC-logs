[17:12] <MasterDuke> timotimo: have you looked at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/571? see anything obvious there?

[17:14] <timotimo> the valgrind output from further above is 99% spam from libcrypto using stack values as an entropy source

[17:15] <timotimo> the stack traces are not worth a lot because they contain jit frames, which don't properly set up the stack for unrolling

[17:15] <timotimo> with those issues combined i haven't the slightest clue :)

[17:15] <timotimo> dinner time! \o/

[17:17] <jnthn> Maybe MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 might make it fail differently/more informatively

[17:18] <MasterDuke> just added that

[17:18] <MasterDuke> but it does look a little different

[17:19] <MasterDuke> odd that's it's always the 8th iteration

[17:21] <MasterDuke> any other options/flags to try?

[17:53] <timotimo> you could twiddle the size of the nursery, or put force_gc into that loop

[17:54] <timotimo> huh, quite interesting that it's crashing in an argument-related opcode

[17:54] <timotimo> MasterDuke: could you see what happens when you disable spesh via MVM_SPESH_DISABLE?

[17:54] <MasterDuke> and JIT_DISABLE?

[17:56] <timotimo> you can't have jit without spesh

[17:56] <MasterDuke> no crash the first time with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[17:57] <timotimo> i feared as much

[17:58] <MasterDuke> or the next two times (and it happens every time without)

[17:59] <timotimo> i'll have a speshial look at this issue

[17:59] <MasterDuke> JIT_DISABLE and adding a nqp::force_gc() in the loop made no difference

[18:00] <MasterDuke> what's that spesh delay option?

[18:00] <timotimo> right, if my hypothesis is correct, it's a spesh issue

[18:00] <timotimo> broken is what it is :D

[18:00] <MasterDuke> heh

[18:00] <timotimo> it's sort of a "global warming"

[18:00] <timotimo> that's the idea anyway

[18:01] <timotimo> what i find interesting is that it crashes both with profile and profile=heap

[18:01] <timotimo> profile itself will instrument the bytecode, but the heap profiler just sucks out a bunch of data every time gc runs

[18:01] *** vendethiel joined
[18:02] <MasterDuke> just MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 made no difference, still crashed at the 8th iteration

[18:03] <timotimo> wait, what commandline should i be running?

[18:03] <MasterDuke> 'use HTTP::UserAgent; my $ua = HTTP::UserAgent.new; (^10).map: { say $_; $ua.get("https://perl6.org"); }'

[18:03] <timotimo> OK

[18:04] <timotimo> using --profile is mandatory?

[18:04] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure it crashes every time with --profile=heap, but it does every time with just --profile

[18:04] <MasterDuke> yeah

[18:04] <timotimo> i'm getting a test failure ...

[18:04] <timotimo> when trying to install HTTP::UA

[18:04] <timotimo> # Expected: HTTP::UserAgent::X::HTTP::Response

[18:04] <timotimo> # Got:      HTTP::UserAgent::X::HTTP::Internal

[18:04] <MasterDuke> i just cloned it and pointed there

[18:04] <timotimo> # Exception message: Internal Error: 'server returned no data'

[18:05] <timotimo> for some reason that failing test didn't change anything about the installation result ?!?

[18:07] <timotimo> interesting, i run it under valgrind and even though the url is https:// i don't get the massive amounts of spam from the crypto lib

[18:09] <MasterDuke> maybe your ssl is compiled with valgrind-friendly options?

[18:10] *** matiaslina joined
[18:10] <MasterDuke> annoyingly i can't use --profile=heap with more than 3 iterations because the OOM killer rears its ugly head

[18:10] <timotimo> that's possible

[18:10] <timotimo> ah, i see

[18:11] <timotimo> yeah, heap snapshots are a bit expensive; we might want to look into compressing that actually. though another suggestion was to make it able to write out heap snapshot data after each GC run

[18:11] <timotimo> which would also give you results even if your program crashes

[18:12] <timotimo> anyway, i've compiled with --valgrind

[18:12] <timotimo> which, among other things, puts in a redzone around the fixedsize allocator pieces

[18:12] <timotimo> i saw an "add bin to freelist" or whatever function in one of the stacktraces

[18:12] <timotimo> that could have something to do with this

[18:13] <MasterDuke> yeah, i got/get that when i don't use MVM_JIT_DISABLE

[18:14] <timotimo> 4 repetitions so far

[18:15] <timotimo> 5

[18:15] <MasterDuke> i don't usually get this many `in ?? ()` when i compile with --debug=3. think it may be something in the ssl bindings?

[18:17] <MasterDuke> nope, i get the same thing from a plain http:// site

[18:17] <timotimo> oh, cool

[18:18] <timotimo> that.s probably a whole lot fewer instructions

[18:18] <MasterDuke> all the behavior/output/errors are exactly the same

[18:22] <timotimo> cool.

[18:24] <timotimo> oh

[18:24] <timotimo> but

[18:24] <timotimo> perl6.org will immediately redirect you to the https site

[18:24] <MasterDuke> i used http://irclog.perlgeek.de/

[18:27] <timotimo> ah, good

[18:29] <timotimo> i want a disassembler (bytecode dumper, whatever) to use from inside gdb ...

[18:31] <timotimo> hm. i wonder how we end up calling into a frame that definitely has named arguments, but it doesn't set up a "named used" field at all, as the size for that is set to 0

[18:32] <timotimo> it should explode a bit earlier than that because it's trying to access the third argument, but there are only two

[18:34] <MasterDuke> can you tell what they are?

[18:36] <timotimo> yeah

[18:36] <timotimo> the frame is !cursor_init

[18:37] <timotimo> (gdb) print tc->cur_frame->params.args[0]

[18:37] <timotimo> $7 = {o = MVMObject * (IETF::RFC_Grammar::URI),

[18:37] <timotimo> (gdb) print tc->cur_frame->params.args[1]

[18:37] <timotimo> $8 = {o = MVMObject * (Scalar), s = , i8 = -40 '\330', u8 = 216 '\330', i16 = -7208, u16 = 58328, i32 = -158407720,

[18:39] <MasterDuke> fwiw i just ran 100 iterations without --profile, completed just fine

[18:40] <timotimo> and the scalar in the first arg contains a Str

[18:40] <MasterDuke> 200

[18:40] <timotimo> mhm

[18:41] <timotimo> right, the profiler's instrumentation must be b0rking somethign somewhere

[18:45] <timotimo> but the heap profiler *also* makes it bork

[18:45] <timotimo> so what gives?

[18:46] <timotimo> or, wait, you couldn't test it because of not enough ram?

[18:46] <MasterDuke> much harder to make the heap profiler do it, maybe it's not related?

[18:46] <timotimo> oh yeah, printed 2, and it's already reached past 4 gigs

[18:46] <timotimo> holy crap, ouchies

[18:46] <timotimo> eats up ram *fast*

[18:46] <timotimo> like, hockey stick fast

[18:47] <MasterDuke> the very first time i got a segv it was with the heap profiler, on the first iteration, but i haven't been able to get another one with the heap profiler

[18:47] <timotimo> welllll, it *could* have been segfault due to memory exhaustion

[18:48] <timotimo> though ... we should MVM_panic in those cases

[18:49] <MasterDuke> is there a way to make perl6-gdb-m quit if the program finishes normally?

[18:50] <timotimo> yeah, should be possible

[18:50] <timotimo> like, set a breakpoint for the end, then "commands", "quit" or something

[18:51] <MasterDuke> hm, i want to run it in a loop

[18:51] <MasterDuke> whil perl6-gdb-m; do true; done;

[18:52] <timotimo> yeah, it should be possible to give it commands to immediately run

[18:53] <MasterDuke> it immediatly runs, but then pauses at the end. i want it to pause if there was a problem, but not pause otherwise

[18:53] * timotimo puts more zram in

[18:53] <timotimo> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3740754/make-gdb-quit-automatically-on-successful-termination

[18:55] <MasterDuke> cool, i'll try to get that working

[18:56] <timotimo> \o/

[18:56] <MasterDuke> found something?

[18:58] <timotimo> nah

[19:01] <timotimo> ouch. system got stuck for a couple minutes because of OOM

[19:03] <timotimo> it runs so much faster with httpbin.org/ip <3

[19:03] <timotimo> but also it doesn't crash with the heap snapshot in these 10 requests

[19:04] <timotimo> ok, but with --profile it still crashes on the 8th run

[19:05] <timotimo> it's basically impossible to get this kind of crash without the profiler, right?

[19:06] <MasterDuke> so far

[19:06] *** geekosaur joined
[19:07] <MasterDuke> i'm running both perl6-valgrind-m and perl6-gb-m in a loop with --profile=heap and just one iteration, no segv so far

[19:08] <timotimo> interesting

[19:08] <timotimo> where do you get all this ram? :)

[19:08] <MasterDuke> i only have 8g, that's why i'm only doing one iteration

[19:09] <MasterDuke> while ./install/bin/perl6-gdb-m --profile=heap --profile-filename=hp.prof -e 'use HTTP::UserAgent; my $ua = HTTP::UserAgent.new; $ua.get("http://irclog.perlgeek.de/");'; do true; done;

[19:13] <timotimo> if it's indeed a spesh-related issue, it'll be impossible to trigger in the first iteration

[19:15] <MasterDuke> the first time i got the segv with the heap profiler it was just one iteration, but maybe it's not related?

[19:16] <timotimo> huh

[19:16] <timotimo> well, it could be a different crashbug

[19:16] <timotimo> the profilers aren't exactly battle-hardened

[19:17] <MasterDuke> oh, damn. it wasn't printing iterations

[19:17] <MasterDuke> that first time

[19:17] <timotimo> oh, so it could have been any run?

[19:18] <MasterDuke> i guess, though it probably couldn't have been more than 4 or i would have just run out of ram

[19:18] <timotimo> mhm

[19:19] <timotimo> oh, in addition to that, it seems like i filled up my hard drive

[19:20] <MasterDuke> heh, that's why i set the filename so they just overwrite each other

[19:20] <timotimo> right, i could/should have set it to /tmp/something, as that's a tmpfs if i'm not mistaken

[19:38] *** spebern joined
[19:43] <samcv> timotimo, what is httpbin.org/ip

[19:43] <timotimo> it's less than 1kb big

[19:43] <samcv> yeah i see that

[19:43] <samcv> how does it make your system faster

[19:44] <timotimo> reduces memory usage by a lot, also creates fewer objects, i.e. the heap snapshots will not be as big

[19:44] <samcv> ah

[19:44] <timotimo> huh. wat.

[19:45] <timotimo> recv from IO/Socket.pm is taking 35% of the total time

[19:45] <MasterDuke> wonder if it would be even better to have something running on localhost serving up a tiny file

[19:45] <timotimo> and initialize from IO/Socket/INET.pm is another 27%

[19:47] <timotimo> maybe --optimize=1 screws the profile over a whole lot

[19:50] <samcv> i'm pissed off my phone is broken

[19:50] <timotimo> :(

[19:50] <samcv> like was at the tail end of warrenty. so sent it in last month. then got it back 2 weeks ago

[19:50] <samcv> then it died a few days ago. have to send it back again

[19:50] <samcv> which is insane

[19:50] <samcv> pls send me non broken phone LG :(

[19:51] <timotimo> >:(

[19:52] <samcv> i was worried that they might not accept it back because the paper said that if your phone has 30 days of warrenty left, and get a replacement it's covered only 30 days, uness you have less than 30 days in which case you get 90 days warrenty

[19:52] <samcv> which is kind of BS

[19:53] <samcv> should just have it be 90 days or however long your warrenty is left, whichever is larger.

[19:53] <samcv> at least i know for sure i get the 90 days because the warrenty is def up as of last week

[19:53] <samcv> and now i have no phone for another week and a half…

[19:54] <timotimo> ugh ugh.

[19:57] *** zakharyas joined
[19:59] <spebern> hi I wanted to ask again on opinions on the nativecall feature to get a way of having an array of structs in contiguous memory

[19:59] <spebern> I think the best way to have that is a new time like timotimo suggested

[19:59] <spebern> so I implemented a version

[20:00] <spebern> just not sure about one case

[20:00] <spebern> what should happen if @arr[1] = $some_struct;

[20:00] <timotimo> same as in C, has to be copy semantics

[20:00] <spebern> this is how I did it

[20:01] <spebern> should it also move the cpointer of the struct?

[20:02] <spebern> I mean so that the cstruct pointer inside the struct object points to the arrray's storage

[20:03] <timotimo> no, i wouldn't expect changes to @arr[1].somefield to be reflected in $some_struct

[20:03] <spebern> ok, nice :-). that would complicate things quite a bit. At least I think so

[20:04] <matiaslina> timotimo, MasterDuke, I just found that MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1 makes the program to not crash

[20:04] *** sivoais joined
[20:04] <timotimo> it would mean we'd have to do some extra bookkeeping so that both the struct and the struct inside the array keep the memory region alive

[20:05] <timotimo> otherwise: fantastic explosions all around

[20:05] <spebern> yes :D

[20:05] <spebern> I'm gonna look at the code again this week and then push it to my fork

[20:05] <timotimo> matiaslina: inline? oh nope, nope, nope, nope, nope :)

[20:06] <spebern> also I wanted to ask if there is already a way or a plan for something like creatting "**flat_struct_array"

[20:07] <spebern> *creating

[20:07] <timotimo> apart from just Pointer[CArrayOfStruct[Struct]]?

[20:07] <matiaslina> anything wrong with that?

[20:08] <timotimo> matiaslina: it's quite a difficult piece of code

[20:08] <spebern> what if I want to initialize that

[20:08] <spebern> Pointer only has a constructor that takes an int

[20:08] <timotimo> you'd have to CArrayOfStruct.new and somehow give it a size

[20:09] <timotimo> oh, how do we do that usually ...

[20:09] <spebern> isn't CArrayOfStruct.new something like *carray_of_struct?

[20:09] <timotimo> yeah

[20:10] <spebern> for the bindings that I wanted to write I need **carray_of_struct

[20:10] *** TimToady joined
[20:10] <spebern> and I haven't figured out a way to do that

[20:10] <timotimo> you can definitely "is rw" into the parameter

[20:11] <timotimo> i mean "CArrayOfStruct[MyStruct] $foo is rw"

[20:11] <timotimo> it'll give a layer of indirection

[20:12] <spebern> ok, I'll try that, thank you :-)

[20:12] <timotimo> cool!

[20:12] <timotimo> looking forward to that contribution

[20:12] <spebern> hope it's not that bad, too me it seems like it is bit of a copy of the carray code

[20:13] <spebern> *to me

[20:13] <timotimo> yeah, probably has to be :<

[20:17] <timotimo> C doesn't lend itself to code-reuse if things are just slightly different in the right ways

[20:29] <spebern> I'm out, good night

[20:32] <timotimo> have a good one!

[20:32] *** spebern left
[20:57] *** matiasli1a joined
[21:16] <MasterDuke> matiasli1a: we've got it easily reproducable with just --profile, but not --profile=heap. maybe you can figure out a repro for that?

[21:23] <MasterDuke> timotimo: still around? interested in some unsignedness questions?

[21:24] <timotimo> oh

[21:24] <timotimo> maybe? :)

[21:24] <MasterDuke> well, i added bindattr_u and bindattrs_u ops to moar

[21:25] <MasterDuke> copied bindattr_i, just changing to MVM_reg_uint64

[21:26] <MasterDuke> and added is_unsigned to MVMNativeRefREPRData

[21:27] <MasterDuke> and added MVM_nativeref_write_lex_u

[21:27] *** matiaslina joined
[21:28] <MasterDuke> and in a couple places added `if (repr_data->is_unsigned) { <do unsigned stuff> } else { <do pre-existing code> }`

[21:29] <MasterDuke> and the unsigned branch gets called

[21:29] <MasterDuke> ...however...

[21:29] <timotimo> mhm?

[21:31] <MasterDuke> you can still assign a negative number to an unsigned attribute

[21:31] <MasterDuke> and it interprets it as unsigned

[21:32] <MasterDuke> which makes sense, you just give it 64 bits, it interprets those bits as you tell it to

[21:32] *** matiasli1a joined
[21:33] <timotimo> ah, so the problem is we don't have unsigned literals?

[21:33] <MasterDuke> possibly

[21:33] <timotimo> or, you know, a conversion operator, or what

[21:34] <MasterDuke> m: my $a = class :: { has uint64 $.foo is rw }.new( foo => -1 ); say $a.foo

[21:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar ca1acb: OUTPUT: «-1␤»

[21:35] <MasterDuke> that should die

[21:36] <MasterDuke> P6bigint.set_uint is being called, so that part is right

[21:37] <timotimo> mhm

[21:37] <MasterDuke> but somehow, somewhere, it (rakudo, nqp, moar) should die

[21:38] <timotimo> i find it really mind-boggling, the whole topic

[21:38] <MasterDuke> same here

[21:39] <timotimo> i have no idea what places should do conversion or what

[21:41] <MasterDuke> right. P6bigint.set_uint takes a MVMuint64, i don't think it can know whether it got a "wrong" value

[21:41] <MasterDuke> it should just set the value its given

[21:42] <timotimo> right, that's impossible

[21:42] <MasterDuke> but even in the first place (i think) where that code i just showed gets into moar from perl6, bindattr_u

[21:43] <MasterDuke> it's doing: REPR(obj)->attr_funcs.bind_attribute(tc, STABLE(obj), obj, OBJECT_BODY(obj), GET_REG(cur_op, 2).o, GET_REG(cur_op, 4).s, -1, GET_REG(cur_op, 6), MVM_reg_int64);

[21:43] <timotimo> perhaps we need to be putting some stuff into the mast compiler

[21:43] <timotimo> it ought to know if a register is signed or unsigned?

[21:43] <MasterDuke> oops, copied the wrong one, it's actually MVM_reg_uint64

[21:44] <MasterDuke> is there any way to know there if the value it's GET_REGing is negative?

[21:45] <timotimo> hm, you ought to be able to ask the frame what type the register is

[21:45] <MasterDuke> ah, how does one do that?

[21:46] <timotimo> MVMStaticFrameBody -> local_types, i think?

[21:56] <MasterDuke> i just got myself more confused

[21:59] <MasterDuke> hm, i'm now in p6box_u

[22:02] <MasterDuke> which is in rakudo, and just does: GET_REG(tc, 0).o = MVM_repr_box_uint(tc, Int, GET_REG(tc, 2).u64);

[22:43] <MasterDuke> [dan@alexandria p6]$ p6 -e 'my $a = class :: { has uint64 $.foo is rw }.new( foo => -1 ); say $a.foo' native unsigned integers can't be negative   in block <unit> at -e line 1
