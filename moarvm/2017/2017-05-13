[09:27] <dogbert17> m: say 1 ∈ (Set) ?? "present" !! "not present"

[09:27] <yoleaux> 03:10Z <Zoffix> dogbert17: if you're interested. Got a segfault with some of my code; possibly something to do with native typed attributes:  zef update; zef install Testo; cd $(mktemp -d); git clone https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IO-Dir .; git checkout 70f8502; perl6 t/01-operation.t

[09:27] <yoleaux> 03:16Z <Zoffix> dogbert17: actually it was trying to read a close dir handle. Filed as: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131301

[09:28] <dogbert17> m: say 1 ∈ (SetHash) ?? "present" !! "not present"

[09:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 50d5ac: OUTPUT: «not present␤»

[09:28] * dogbert17 notes that the latter case used to say 'Invocant of method 'Set' must be an object instance of type 'SetHash', not a type object of type 'SetHash'.  Did you forget a '.new'?'

[09:37] * dogbert17 notices that he's posting in the wrong group /o\
