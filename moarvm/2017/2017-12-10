[13:42] <jnthn> Neat, ARM access for cheap: https://www.scaleway.com/armv8-cloud-servers/

[13:43] <jnthn> Might sign up for that at some point, so I've a place to test/debug big endian issues

[13:46] <MasterDuke> wonder how much faster those are than RPi3s?

[13:47] <MasterDuke> i believe those have ARMv8 cpus also, but i don't know anything about the Cavium ThunderX SoCs they're advertising for that cloud service
