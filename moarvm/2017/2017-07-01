[13:51] <samcv> no fun allowed :(

[13:52] <jnthn> I don't think it was a deliberate choice :)

[13:55] <mst> it's a fairly standard setting

[13:55] <mst> mostly because IRC colours are obnoxious

[13:56] <jnthn> m: say 2 2

[13:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75e87d: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Two terms in a row‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> say 2‚èè 2‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        infix‚ê§        infix stopper‚ê§        postfix‚ê§        statement end‚ê§        statement modifier‚ê§        ‚Ä¶¬ª

[13:56] <jnthn> Getting the colored output there can be nice, though :)

[13:57] <mst> I'd offer to change it but first we're going to have to track down diakopter and hit him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper

[13:57] <mst> since he registered this channel and then never gave anybody access to it

[13:58] <samcv> i always have so many untracked files so i made a script to reverse the order of git status https://a.uguu.se/ZvwRA8KNvQcA_Screenshot_20170701_065638.png

[13:58] <samcv> left is normal. right is piped through my script

[13:58] <samcv> so the stuff i care about is always at the bottom

[13:58] <jnthn> o.O

[13:59] <samcv> also yes i need to clean it up

[13:59] <jnthn> I tend to just stick things in .git/info/exclude

[13:59] <jnthn> (Like a local .gitignore)

[13:59] <samcv> still though

[13:59] <samcv> it's nice to always get it at the bottom

[13:59] <samcv> even if there's only 5 thnigs

[13:59] <jnthn> True :)

[14:02] <mst> argh

[14:03] <mst> that's really cute but the colours make my eyes hurt

[14:08] <samcv> what does?

[14:08] <mst> your screenshot, the green/red

[14:08] <mst> I have all that disabled in my terminals

[14:08] <samcv> ah

[14:08] <samcv> yeah i don't like the red

[14:09] <samcv> though i do have syntax highlighting

[14:09] <samcv> heh

[14:09] <mst> http://www.trout.me.uk/synhi.jpg

[14:09] <samcv> https://cry.nu/files/konsole.webm

[14:09] <samcv> also it underlines folders that actually exist which is nice when typing

[14:10] <samcv> video shows

[14:12] <samcv> also the >>> chevrons reverse direction when i enter vicmd mode which is neat

[14:12] <samcv> the video is not the smoothest thing ever but in person there's no lag from having the highlighting at all suprisingly

[14:18] <mst> yeah, not looking, syntax hilighting fairly reliably gives me a headache

[14:19] <samcv> though you could turn off the color and only enable the part that underlines the directories. tbh that's the most useful part of it

[14:19] <samcv> so if you start typing something that doesn't exist you get immediate feedback

[14:21] <samcv> what do you guys use for email?

[14:21] <mst> how's the underlining set up?

[14:21] <samcv> what do you mean? did you see the video?

[14:21] <samcv> it's half way in

[14:21] <mst> no, I didn't, because you told me it was full of colours and stuff and I don't want to have to take painkillers

[14:21] <samcv> ah

[14:22] <samcv> well directories are underlined while typing. and as soon as you type something not a directory it is not underlined anymore

[14:22] <samcv> there's no lag or whatever, as soon as you type the letter you just type out and the directory all of it is underlined (or file)

[14:23] <samcv> if you mistype a letter then it will cease to be underlined

[14:23] <samcv> the entire series of text that is. in which case i backspace and type the correct letter or whatever

[14:45] <samcv> mst, i made one with very little colors https://cry.nu/files/konsole-typing2.webm

[14:46] <mst> neat, how's the shell configured?

[14:47] <samcv> i'm using zprezto for the zsh framework which is pretty nice but all you need for the highlighting is this https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting

[14:47] <samcv> and there's several highlighting modules you *can* enable. this just needs the 'main' one not the others

[14:47] <mst> this almost tempts me to try zsh

[14:47] <samcv> which i guess is the default one

[14:48] <samcv> this is the zsh framework i use https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto it's my favorite because it's not slow or bloated and badly programmed like many of the others

[14:52] <samcv> and you might hate it but i also have one enabled which shows a ghost of previously typed commands https://a.uguu.se/WAILqK4YnJVo_Screenshot_20170701_075159.png that show as you type

[14:52] <samcv> and you can press the right arrow to select it

[14:53] <samcv> if you want a vid see half way through this https://asciinema.org/a/37390

[21:09] <timotimo> good talk, jnthn!

[22:03] <jnthn> timotimo: Thanks. :) Hope it will help explain how to apply the concurrency stuff some more. :)

[22:03] <timotimo> mhm

[22:03] <timotimo> so here's something about the p6opaque debug dumper function that confuses me

[22:03] <timotimo> if there's no flattened stable for an attribute, it uses get_obj_at_offset, which makes sense to me

[22:04] <timotimo> but if there is, it just calls box_funcs.get_str?

[22:04] <timotimo> that's definitely not guaranteed to work just based on "there is a flattened stable here"

[22:04] <jnthn> Uh, no o.O

[22:05] <jnthn> It could be a flattened in int or num

[22:05] <timotimo> right

[22:06] <timotimo> so i'd check the reprid in the flattened stable at the very least

[22:16] <timotimo> still, props to nine for whipping it up

[22:17] <timotimo> i was going to write it in python with the gdb bindings, but it would have been slow and quite painful

[22:21] <jnthn> Oh, for sure. :) All debugging stuff we have was to scratch a debugging itch :)

[22:28] * timotimo smells the optimization opportunity of the milennium

[22:28] * timotimo puts a --> Nil into the method signature of NativeCall's !setup

[22:31] <timotimo> huh, it's saying the sink was called from the nqp::nativecall op - though it could very well be from the code it gens for that nqp op

[22:34] <timotimo> i hate it when calling MVM_dump_bytecode gives a malloc error and segfault :|
