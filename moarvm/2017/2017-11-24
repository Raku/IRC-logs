[20:23] <dogbert17> shouldn't there be parentheses around this MVM_BIGINT thingy or are they really optional? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L720

[20:26] <dogbert17> i.e. 'if (MVM_BIGINT_IS_BIG(ba)) {' instead of 'if MVM_BIGINT_IS_BIG(ba) {'

[21:13] <jnthn> All's fair in macros and war...

[21:13] <yoleaux> 18:13Z <lizmat> jnthn: I have an almost working prototype of .toggle, but first will have some LPW socializing and dinner

[21:14] <jnthn> dogbert17: I likely compiles 'cus the macro puts parens around what it expands to, which is probably wise, but yeah, it looks a bit odd :)

[21:21] <dogbert17> it causes the program cppcheck to generate a syntax error and then I noticed that parens had been used elsewhere in the file

[21:21] <dogbert17> I might PR that

[21:28] <jnthn> Feel free :)
