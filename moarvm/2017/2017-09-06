[01:52] <samcv> was someone looking at trying to do heap profiling?

[01:52] <samcv> i think there are malloc replacements that can do stuff like that. i know jemalloc does

[01:54] <MasterDuke> yeah, but the heap snapshot profiler actually gives you Rakudo-level info (e.g., number/size of types of objects)

[01:54] <samcv> ah nice

[07:52] <timotimo> yo

[08:02] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[08:02] <brrt> i've been worryingly unproductive the last few weeks :-o

[08:02] <timotimo> you think so?

[08:02] <brrt> yeah

[08:02] <brrt> i mean, nothing got done, actually

[08:03] <timotimo> i think you've been fine, whereas i have actually been worryingly unproductive during that time

[08:03] <brrt> well, except for merging the old changes, but these were old

[08:03] <timotimo> it's still an important task

[08:05] <samcv> ^

[08:06] *** robertle joined
[08:06] <nine> That's one thing I have a quite hard time teaching my developers at work: unmerged work is completely useless. It has exactly 0 value to the user. So yes, going the final step of cleaning a branch and getting it through review is critical for turning time into value.

[08:06] <timotimo> i have many branches with unmerged work :(

[08:07] <timotimo> at least the one i'm working on right now is making nice progress towards being included for this release

[08:08] <nine> timotimo: that's the irony. You've made great progress this time, yet feel unproductive. Just hang in, you're almost there :)

[08:09] <timotimo> oh, i was refering to the time before this work

[08:09] <timotimo> i actually feel productive for a change

[08:12] <samcv> i've been feeling fairly productive. technically not in my grant but i want to get anything i can that uses get_grapheme_at_nocheck to use the cached grapheme iterator but only for strands

[08:12] *** AlexDaniel joined
[08:12] <samcv> and i got it so that now if it requests a grapheme earlier than before, it will reinitialize the grapheme iterator

[08:13] <samcv> eventually we could probably make it so it works backwards as well instead of just forwards. and i already fixed a bug which made it not work for repeats unless it was starting at 0

[08:13] <samcv> feels awesome to get such great speed ups :)

[08:14] <samcv> though since perl 6 flattens the strings before doing regex won't has as much impact i guess?

[08:17] <timotimo> we could perhaps make "indexingoptimized" do something cleverer than just flattening the whole thing

[08:17] <timotimo> if the performance impact from a few strands isn't too bad, we could probably keep a few in there

[08:17] <timotimo> where does your grapheme iterator cache live btw?

[08:18] <brrt> ++ for a backwards-walking iterator

[08:18] <brrt> that seems like it ought to be totally doable

[08:18] <samcv> timotimo, in iter.h

[08:19] <samcv> yeah

[08:19] <timotimo> i mean where is the cache installed?

[08:19] <samcv> and probably easier now that i elimited a ton of loops

[08:19] <samcv> well it's stored only in the function iterating

[08:19] <timotimo> cool

[08:19] <samcv> MVMGraphemeIter_cached which stores the cached grapheme, the last requested index, and the grapheme iterator

[08:20] <samcv> and so either does MVM_string_gi_get_grapheme, or returns the cached grapheme, or moves it and returns it. or reiniatizes it and then moves and returns

[08:20] <samcv> allowing it to save lots of work for strands

[08:20] <timotimo> the GraphemeIter has a GraphemeIter in itself?

[08:21] <samcv> timotimo, https://github.com/samcv/MoarVM/blob/ignorecase_ignoremark_cached/src/strings/iter.h#L308-L328

[08:21] <samcv> scroll up a tad and you will see the struct for the type and the initializer

[08:24] <timotimo> looks good

[08:24] <timotimo> the name is strange, but i suppose it's okay since it's not public API

[08:24] <samcv> yeah

[08:25] <samcv> if you use it for flat strings it will slow it down, so it shouldn't be used everywhere

[08:25] <samcv> i mean not *that* much. but like at least 20%

[08:26] <samcv> and 2x speedup for indexic when it's made up of 10 strands

[08:26] <samcv> which is impressive

[08:27] <timotimo> nice

[08:30] <brrt> can i ask the stupid question why the cache is in the data structure and not in the caller

[08:30] *** zakharyas joined
[08:32] <samcv> it is in the caller

[08:32] <samcv> well you declare `MVMGraphemeIter_cached gic` and then initialize it

[08:33] <samcv> so it's stored on the stack in the caller

[08:33] <samcv> or do you mean some other thing?

[08:42] <brrt> hmm, i see what you mean, i guess

[08:43] <brrt> but doesn't the iterator store its current position?

[08:46] <timotimo> it stores a MVMStringIndex "pos"

[08:48] <jnthn> morning o/

[08:48] <brrt> morning

[08:49] <brrt> so, what the 'cached' structure adds, is a cached last grapheme?

[08:49] <brrt> that does make some sense, yes

[08:50] *** lizmat joined
[08:53] <timotimo> i need a different hex editor than okteta ...

[08:56] <jnthn> Coming back to something the day after is usually a good idea. :) I realized that there is a fairly cheap way to find which inline we're in: search BBs looking just at their first instruction and seeing if it has an inline annotation, then we know that's where that inline starts

[08:56] <jnthn> Or ends, for that matter

[08:56] <nine> That sounds almost too easy :D

[08:57] *** Skarsnik joined
[08:57] <timotimo> tried bless, can't even tell it to limit display to n columns

[08:58] <jnthn> Ends is cheaper

[08:59] <jnthn> 'cus ->linear_next

[08:59] <jnthn> Though means you need to pick the max inline end annotation to know the innermost one you're in

[09:01] <timotimo> hte doesn't support 64bit integers ;_;

[09:08] <samcv> brrt, it doesn't store the position it stores just which strand and position in strand and how many repeats left in the particular strand it's on

[09:08] <brrt> timotimo: hexl-mode?

[09:09] <brrt> i see

[09:10] <timotimo> brrt: i'm not comfortable with emacs, though

[09:12] <brrt> well, that's why you'll always be on the lookout for the next tool :-P

[09:12] <timotimo> heh.

[09:13] <timotimo> things that frustrate me in okteta:

[09:13] <timotimo> can't display the offset in decimal (though i could instead output all numbers from the program in hex instead)

[09:13] <timotimo> can't move backwards/forwards in 64bit increments

[09:14] <timotimo> that's more or less it i suppose

[09:15] <timotimo> also, defining structs is a major song-and-dance where you have to create a .desktop file and javascript or xml by hand

[09:17] *** brrt1 joined
[09:18] <timotimo> it doesn't even have an entropy overview

[09:21] <timotimo> m(, you can't click "find previous" right after you clicked "find next" because it puts the cursor after the match and doesn't know to skip the one right before the cursor

[09:23] *** AlexDaniel joined

[10:20] <nine> And I've seen lots of unnecessary sets in the MAST compiled bodies of native subs.

[10:21] <jnthn> The 4% or so win coming from making the rewriting of control exception throws into gotos work with inlines

[10:21] <jnthn> Which means that opt is now useful for Perl 6 code

[10:21] <jnthn> (Because the throw is always in a multi candidate of next/last/redo)

[10:22] <jnthn> So the last actually after optimization becomes a goto in that case now

[12:24] <timotimo> there's lots of next steps

[12:24] <jnthn> And less memory overhead when profiling?

[12:24] <timotimo> only the loading of snapshots is faster. but it's loads faster

[12:24] <jnthn> Yeah, that's the part I was thinking of :)

[12:24] <timotimo> yes, the memory growth of the program under profile is seriously reduced

[12:25] <jnthn> That's the slow part, the actual snapshotting wasn't bad already

[12:25] <nine> Faster and you get output on interrupted programs. That wold already have been soo helpful for me

[13:52] <dogbert17> yay

[13:52] <nwc10> fixing up a curry?

[13:53] <dogbert17> c: MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 HEAD use Test; { { my sub foo { fail }(); CATCH { default { my $bt = .backtrace; is $bt.list.elems, 4, "we correctly have 4 elements in .list"; }} } } # bug

[13:53] <committable6> dogbert17, ¦HEAD(80a3255): «not ok 1 - we correctly have 4 elements in .list␤# Failed test 'we correctly have 4 elements in .list'␤# at /tmp/tJus6tS0Qr line 1␤# expected: '4'␤#      got: '3' «exit code = 1»»

[13:54] <jnthn> That one is simply that when spesh inlines things, the backtraces don't know the inlinees.

[13:54] <dogbert17> aha

[13:54] <jnthn> And...not quite so simple to fix

[13:54] <jnthn> Though we should do it at some point

[13:55] <dogbert17> hardly a disastrous problem

[13:55] <dogbert17> problem is; I'm running out of spesh problems :)

[13:59] * timotimo has the first rough draft of incidents searching

[14:00] <timotimo> doesn't seem quite right, though

[14:00] <jnthn> Seems I've managed to eat my way through my available Perl 6 funding for the moment (though hopefully a bit more coming soon to do some more concurrency stuff). So for now I'm back to what can I do in my copious free time, and should probably look at other $dayjob things for a bit. I'm also impressively behind on blogging...

[14:10] <timotimo> "i've had this post planned for a whole month now!"

[14:11] <jnthn> I got distracted

[16:05] <samcv> timotimo, is the heap snapshot analyzer going to get documentation?

[16:05] <yoleaux> 12:34Z <[Coke]> samcv: the class definition you give for utf8 in the docs doesn't compile.

[16:09] <samcv> .tell [Coke] ok i made a change, hopefully this will fix

[16:09] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to [Coke].

[17:08] <timotimo> samcv: sure, what angle should i approach it from, and where should i put it?

[17:09] <samcv> how to use it. how it works.

[17:09] <samcv> in the docs folder. and if it's current, add it to the README.md in the docs folder too

[17:10] <samcv> the readme used to say that it was all likely outdated, but when i made my string documentation i linked to that and said that was current. so if you add current stuff that's not just design docs add to that list

[17:10] <samcv> also will be away for an hour or so

[17:11] <timotimo> mhm

[17:11] <timotimo> though perhaps the docs should go to the performance section of the perl6 docs or the readme and/or wiki of the heap snapshot analyzer instead?

[17:19] <Skarsnik> should probably be a page with everything that help debug stuff x)

[17:59] <timotimo> the "performance" page already talks about the regular profiler

[18:38] <jnthn> I see code to review...

[18:38] <jnthn> uh...ltos of it given I'm meant to also look at the expr JIT :)

[18:44] <dogbert2> m: my int $master = 0; await start { if cas($master, 0, 1) == 0 { say "Master!" }} xx 4 # this code fails on 32 bit systems, is that expected?

[18:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar bfee5a: OUTPUT: «Master!␤»

[18:45] <jnthn> Yes

[18:46] <jnthn> That's precisely why the atomicint type exists

[18:47] <dogbert2> cool, I took it from the atomicint documentation should a comment be added or should int be changed to atomicint?

[18:47] <jnthn> Should be changed to atomicint :)

[18:47] <jnthn> Nice catch

[18:48] <dogbert2> should I fix it?

[18:48] <moritz> this is rather unperlish

[18:48] <moritz> normally the operation dictates the semantics, not the type

[18:49] <moritz> an atomic operation being silently unatomic just because its operand is unatomic seems dangerous

[18:50] <jnthn> Why are you assuming it's silently unatomic?

[18:51] <jnthn> m: my int32 $master = 0; await start { if cas($master, 0, 1) == 0 { say "Master!" }} xx 4

[18:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar bfee5a: OUTPUT: «Tried to get the result of a broken Promise␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤Original exception:␤    Cannot atomic load from an integer lexical not of the machine's native size␤      in block  at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:51] <jnthn> It does that

[18:51] <jnthn> Very clear failure

[18:51] <moritz> probably because I misinterprted dogbert2's "fails" as "gives wrong result"

[18:51] <moritz> sorry

[18:51] <jnthn> Ah :)

[18:51] <dogbert2> my bad, I could have been more explicit :)

[18:55] <dogbert2> example fixed

[19:05] <dogbert2> next question, in the last few weeks 'make spectest' has become alot slower 20-25 percent in my case. Any theories as to why?

[19:08] * Zoffix didn't notice any slowdown in `make stresstest`

[19:08] <Zoffix> But perhaps the new unicode tests are to blame?

[19:09] <dogbert2> perhaps, considering trying to figure out when this happened

[19:12] <dogbert2> compare these two for example:

[19:12] <dogbert2> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-07-25#i_14918057

[19:13] <dogbert2> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-09-06#i_15123112

[19:16] <dogbert2> there's one large drop between July 26th and 31st, from ~220 secs to ~260 secs

[21:07] <lizmat> jnthn: given a native descriptor, is there a way to create a PIO out of that ?

[21:08] <lizmat> or: is there a way to close by a given native descriptor (fileno) ?

[21:09] <lizmat> so one wouldn't need to keep the PIO around, but just the fileno (native desc)

[21:22] <samcv> Zoffix, what new unicode tests?

[21:22] <brrt> what's PIO? parallel? perl-level?

[21:23] <lizmat> historically Parrot IO Object I believe

[21:23] <lizmat> basically the VM's handle of a file

[21:26] <geekosaur> I'd be surprised if that exists usefully

[21:26] <geekosaur> even C doesn't support it these days

[21:26] <Zoffix> samcv: no idea. It was just a guess. I recall last time I noticed slowdown was due to new unicode tests, so I figured maybe dogbert2 was seeing that same slowdown

[21:26] <geekosaur> (that is, you can make a new stdio file object from a descriptor, but you can't find an existing one that way)

[21:27] <geekosaur> and if this is related to buffering, you need to find the existing one, not make a new one

[21:43] *** lizmat joined
[21:48] <jnthn> lizmat: No

[21:48] <yoleaux> 20:42Z <Zoffix> jnthn: are return type checks in protos simply NYI or are they not meant to work? This doesn't die: class { proto method f(--> Int) {*}; multi method f { "foo!" } }.new.f.say

[21:49] <jnthn> lizmat: And it wouldn't helpanyway

[21:49] <jnthn> lizmat: Since your goal is to get the handled flushed on close, and the buffer hangs off the handle

[21:49] <lizmat> jnthn: well, then I guess option #2 is not an option, as it thoroughly breaks the lock tests   :-(

[21:49] <jnthn> Optin 2 is what we have now, I thought you were implementing option 1?

[21:49] <lizmat> no, vv

[21:49] <jnthn> (Keep a list of open handles)

[21:50] <brrt> is there anything against doing that on the perl level?

[21:50] <lizmat> argh, yeah, you're right

[21:50] <lizmat> option #2 is what we have, option #1 breaks the locking tests

[21:50] <jnthn> brrt: Keeping the list? That's the approach I've suggested, and that I know lizmat++ is working on

[21:50] <jnthn> The...locking tests?!

[21:51] <lizmat> S32-io/lock.t

[21:51] <jnthn> Details?

[21:51] <jnthn> Oh, *file* locking

[21:51] <lizmat> hangs on the first subtest of test 6

[21:51] <jnthn> I thought you meant S17-lowlevel/lock.t ;)

[21:51] <jnthn> Shoulda guessed but, well, that's what tiredness does

[21:51] <jnthn> That's...odd

[21:52] <jnthn> Any idea why it hangs?

[21:52] <jnthn> I mean, we shouldn't be doing anything different until exit

[21:52] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/001726b47eb5051b247ef1498f3fda7d

[21:52] <lizmat> my work so far

[21:52] <jnthn> Oooking

[21:52] <jnthn> uh, Looking

[21:53] <jnthn> Heh, binding into the array on fileno

[21:53] <jnthn> Cute. I hadn't thought of that and was figuring it would be an O(n) search...

[21:53] <jnthn> Or a hash on fileno

[21:53] <jnthn> I guess maybe the hash has slightly better properties of fd re-use doesn't happen

[21:53] <lizmat> I thought we could spare the few bytes on that array

[21:53] <jnthn> But anyway, that won't be the issue here

[21:56] <jnthn> Hmm, odd, don't immediately see how that'd cause issues

[21:56] <jnthn> oh but

[21:56] <jnthn> It's not threadsafe

[21:56] <lizmat> but?

[21:56] <jnthn> If handles are opened on different threads

[21:56] <jnthn> Then there's a race on $opened

[21:56] <jnthn> Since it's a dynamic array

[21:56] <jnthn> Dunno if that's *the* problem, but it's certainly *a* problem

[21:57] <lizmat> aaahh... hmmm

[21:57] <jnthn> Would need a lock to protect it

[21:57] <lizmat> so can we find out max fileno ?

[21:57] <lizmat> well, I was trying to do this without a lock

[21:57] <lizmat> assuming the fileno's would not be duped across threads

[21:57] <timotimo> the user is free to raise the maximum fileno by quite a bit

[21:57] <lizmat> so we only need to make sure the array has the max fileno size\

[21:58] <jnthn> Also the closing thread != the opening thread

[21:58] <brrt> that assumption is valid, but you might get concurrent resizes, i think

[21:58] <jnthn> Or doesn't have to be

[21:58] <jnthn> Yeah, concurrent resizes might be what's messing this up at the moment

[21:58] <jnthn> Just lock it

[21:58] <jnthn> It's not that expensive.

[21:58] <lizmat> ok, will try that

[21:58] <timotimo> do we only need to store "is opened?" for every fileno?

[21:58] <jnthn> In the scheme of things

[21:58] <timotimo> we might want to store one per bit rather than one per byte or worse

[21:58] <jnthn> timotimo: No, we need to keep track of the handles that are open, so we can close/flush them

[21:58] <brrt> opening a file is already expensive anyway ?

[21:59] <timotimo> ah, we need to know about the buffer, too

[21:59] <jnthn> Right

[21:59] <jnthn> I have no idea if fds get reused if you open lots of files over the lifetime of a process?

[21:59] <jnthn> (open/close, I mean)

[22:00] <timotimo> no clue where to look to find out what subset of our target platforms would make such a guarantee

[22:00] <timotimo> but i'd assume re-use would happen eventually

[22:01] <jnthn> Yeah, depends how eventually

[22:01] <jnthn> If we're locking anyway then we could use a hash

[22:01] <jnthn> And delete the key

[22:01] <lizmat> but re-use would not be an issue

[22:01] <jnthn> Would force stringifying the fds is all

[22:01] <lizmat> because that would imply the old one got closed, so the entry would be nulled in the list

[22:02] <jnthn> lizmat: Yeah, my worry is more that if they're not re-used and it's a long-lived program, then we could read fd 100000 or something

[22:02] *** dogbert2 joined
[22:02] <jnthn> Which sure is "only" 800 KB

[22:02] <jnthn> s/read/reach/

[22:02] <timotimo> the default max fileno on my system is 1024, fwiw

[22:03] <timotimo> but remember that we also blow filenos with other things, like libuv related pieces for the event loop

[22:04] <jnthn> ah, ok

[22:04] <timotimo> that's why there was this bug where creating a crapton of threads would segfault

[22:04] <timotimo> we didn't check the return value of creating uv eventloops

[22:05] <lizmat> ok, I've not tried it with locking just yet, just by setting the list size to 1K

[22:05] <lizmat> and it still hangs

[22:35] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/677

[22:55] <Zoffix> .tell lizmat did a bit of debugging of the lock hanging issue. Golfed version is start `./perl6 -e '"foo".IO.open(:w).lock; sleep'` in one terminal. In another terminal in same dir run `./perl6 -e 'start { "foo".IO.open(:w).lock }; sleep 1'` and the second one'll never quit after 1 second, despite the lock running in a separate Promise. Hope that helps :)

[22:55] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[22:56] <jnthn> Oh, that makes sense

[22:57] <jnthn> Operations on a syncfile are protected by a mutex

[22:57] <jnthn> The .lock operation will be holding it

[22:57] <jnthn> The .close operation won't be abl to get it

[22:57] <Zoffix> Oh

[22:57] <jnthn> *able

[22:57] <Zoffix> .tell lizmat jnthn++ figured out the cause: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2017-09-06#i_15127594

[22:57] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[22:58] <jnthn> The point of the mutex being to protect a file handle data structure when concurrent threads attempt to use it, and thus not explode violently

[22:59] <jnthn> I'm too tired to have any useful thoughts beyond knowing that's probably what's going on, alas

[23:01] <jnthn> Is the point of the test to check we can't acquire the lock?

[23:02] <Zoffix> Yes.

[23:02] <jnthn> Hmm

[23:02] <jnthn> I guess if we're willing to change the test then we could make the close-at-exit thing optional make the .open call pass :!close-at-exit or so

[23:03] <Zoffix> It checks whether .lock blocks (printing some stuff after the .lock line) in that case and because it runs in a promise it exists after 1 second and the test just checks the stuff after the .lock line never got printed

[23:03] <Zoffix> FWIW none of the .lock/.unlock tests are part of 6.c-errata so I'd guess there's more freedom to alter them

[23:05] <jnthn> I guess it hinges on if we think anyone would write such a program in a non-test situation

[23:05] <jnthn> They potentially would

[23:07] <jnthn> If they wanted to try and acquire the log, but whine/exit if they failed

[23:07] <jnthn> And we'd block their exit

[23:08] <jnthn> I think we should provide a :!close-at-exit either way for folks who run into other situations we don't discover ourselves

[23:08] <jnthn> If we want to magic it away, we could remove the file from the auto-close list while attempting to acquire the lock, and put it back in once we have
