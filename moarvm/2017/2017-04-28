[11:49] <lizmat> hmmm...notice of build breakage on CentOS6

[11:49] <lizmat> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/587

[11:50] <timotimo> thanks

[13:05] *** AlexDaniel joined
[13:43] <stmuk_> timotimo: see my comment on that issue

[13:59] <timotimo> stmuk_: can you help me get the rdtscp configure-time probe working?

[13:59] <timotimo> oh

[13:59] <timotimo> i think i know what's wrong

[14:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/configure-telemeh-probe-rdtscp: we always define MVM_RDTSCP, but sometimes with 0 instead of 1.

[14:05] <stmuk_> timotimo: sure

[14:05] <stmuk_> shall I test now or wait a bit?

[14:06] <timotimo> now

[14:07] <timotimo> interesting

[14:08] <timotimo> i'll reproduce locally by just setting RDTSCP to 0 in the makefile

[14:09] <timotimo> huh

[14:12] <stmuk_> works fine on Centos 6 (I can test on OpenBSD later)

[14:55] <Zoffix> How do you pronounce "telemeh"? "t-eh-l-eh-m-eh"?

[14:58] <stmuk_> tele meh

[15:19] <timotimo> tell-uh-meh

[15:21] <robertle> jsut like telomere

[17:21] <timotimo> hm. i still don't know how we could cause all other threads to be interrupted reliably so that we can slurp up their profile data

[17:22] <MasterDuke_> that would be awesome though...

[17:23] <timotimo> i mean, normally when we exit we just have the other threads killed dead in their tracks by the process just ending

[17:33] <timotimo> we could probably abuse the gc signaling mechanism, but instead of doing gc, we do our profile stuff

[17:42] <timotimo> the thing is ... we probably need to GC multiple times inside the process of creating the data structures from the profile data

[17:42] <timotimo> however

[17:43] <timotimo> hm

[17:43] <timotimo> i thought perhaps we can just recursively memcpy stuff away so the gc doesn't touch it any more, but that sounds like recipe for absolute disaster

[17:47] *** AlexDaniel joined
[18:32] <timotimo> though of course by turning on gen2-allocatoin-by-default gets us out of "having to gc a bunch" trouble

[18:55] <samcv> good *

[18:55] <timotimo> nood goon

[18:55] <timotimo> that came out strange

[18:57] <samcv> heh

[19:42] <timotimo> the cat really likes the upper left edge of my laptop screen

[19:47] <lizmat> timotimo: perhaps that's the warmest part ?

[19:48] * lizmat remembers our cats liking to sleep on top of a monitor

[19:48] <lizmat> but that was in the pre-flatscreen days  :-)

[19:52] <timotimo> heh

[19:52] <timotimo> nah, he's rubbing his flew on it

[19:59] *** geekosaur joined
[20:10] * Zoffix wonders what a flew of a cat is :)

[20:13] <timotimo> the dictionary spat that word out

[20:14] <timotimo> hm, seems like that's reserved for canines

[20:14] <Zoffix> face?

[20:14] <Zoffix> whiskers?

[20:14] <timotimo> "upper lip"

[20:14] <timotimo> basically "where the whiskers come out, or below there"

[20:14] <Zoffix> ah

[20:15] <Zoffix> I looked at the first def in dictionary and it was something about tubes and fire boilers :)

[20:15] <timotimo> which also causes the corner of the laptop lid ends up inside the mouth one time out of three

[20:24] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: could you give me that little set of sql queries again? the ones that you made to give the same results as the html profiler?

[20:25] <MasterDuke_> timotimo: i put some examples in the PR comments https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/354. let me know if those don't get you what you need

[20:26] <timotimo> ah, *there* it was

[20:43] * timotimo is briefly fascinated by zmodem

[21:32] *** geekosaur joined
[22:01] <timotimo> i ran a profile of a thing and it's totally killed my puter

[22:03] <MasterDuke_> creating the profile did? or accessing it?

[22:04] <timotimo> creating

[22:04] <timotimo> tried to build it with the sql mode. i'm not sure if it even reached the perl6 part of the code, though

[22:05] <timotimo> wonder when my system will be resurrected ...

[22:06] <timotimo> we might really want to turn on gen2-by-default allocation during the call graph dumping

[22:07] <japhb> timotimo: Ragnarok?

[22:08] <MasterDuke_> should probably batch writing out the sql lines. it's simpler not to, but our IO is slow

[22:09] <timotimo> have you profiled that? :)

[22:10] <MasterDuke_> heh, yes and no. i've timed the json and the sql output, and json is faster

[22:10] <timotimo> mhm

[22:10] <MasterDuke_> for the exact same profile (i.e., i hacked it to write both)

[22:12] <timotimo> i'd like to use my desktop again please

[22:13] <MasterDuke_> i guess i can't be sure the reason to_sql is slower is because of how it does IO, but that's my guess

[22:15] <timotimo> i wonder why this particular profile is so explosive

[22:18] <MasterDuke_> what's the perl6 code?

[22:19] <timotimo> it's my brownian tree implementation off of rosettacode

[22:21] <MasterDuke_> ha, taking longer than the 25s mentioned in the description?

[22:22] <timotimo> depends on what size and particle count you're using

[22:22] <timotimo> my run was 55 seconds

[22:22] <timotimo> and since then it's been trying to build the profile

[22:24] <MasterDuke_> is the output file being written to?

[22:24] <timotimo> how am i supposed to find out?

[22:25] <MasterDuke_> it's getting bigger/has more lines?

[22:25] <timotimo> well, yeah, but how am i supposed to find out how big it is?

[22:26] <timotimo> i'm telling you i can not use the device

[22:26] <timotimo> at. all.

[22:26] <timotimo> no mouse cursor movement, no ssh connection

[22:26] <timotimo> the clock hasn't updated since 23:56, now it's 00:26

[22:26] <MasterDuke_> oh!

[22:27] <MasterDuke_> that...does make it harder...

[22:28] <timotimo> a little bit

[22:28] <timotimo> i might kill the machine

[22:28] <timotimo> if i can, that is

[22:29] <timotimo> i pressed a few combinations and pushed the power button

[22:29] <timotimo> don't think anything's happening

[22:30] <timotimo> i held the power button and it did a hard shut-off

[22:31] <MasterDuke_> hate when i have to do that

[22:32] <timotimo> yeah

[22:32] <timotimo> not sure how to make it unnecessary

[22:34] <timotimo> hm

[22:34] <timotimo> the numbers in the calls table are reaching 80k

[22:34] <timotimo> when i have only size=10 and particlenum=30

[22:35] <MasterDuke_> seems a lot

[22:35] <timotimo> i think so, too

[22:41] <timotimo> rec_depth goes up to 280

[22:43] <timotimo> i have not written any sql in far too long

[22:54] <timotimo> MasterDuke_: since the callees table was renamed calls, maybe we should rename callee_id to call_id?

[22:55] <timotimo> or just id, like routines has a column named "id"

[22:55] <timotimo> huh

[22:56] <timotimo> why does allocations have both a caller_id and a call_id?

[22:56] <timotimo> sorry, callee_id

[23:02] <MasterDuke_> heh. yeah, i wasn't sure at first which was needed, so i just added both (caller and callee to allocations)

[23:02] <MasterDuke_> and yeah, renaming callee_id would probably make sense

[23:04] <timotimo> DBIish is not happy with me

[23:05] <timotimo> yeah, user error

[23:09] <timotimo> poor dot

[23:09] <timotimo> has to handle 80k nodes for this particular document

[23:10] <timotimo> Error: <stdin>: syntax error in line 83954 near ''

[23:14] <MasterDuke_> in the sql output?

[23:15] <timotimo> no, in my dot transformation of it

[23:16] <timotimo> it was some bad escaping or something

[23:24] *** geekosaur joined
[23:27] <timotimo> well, it's still trying to render

[23:27] <timotimo> not sure if it's layouting or what

[23:29] <timotimo> it shouldn't be terribly hard to do for dot, the graph should be perfectly tree-like

[23:41] <timotimo> i'll suspend my computer so i can sleep (it's noisy), but i'll leave dot running so it'll maybe finish tomorrow %)

[23:42] <MasterDuke_> i've used dot a bunch before, but always on tiny graphs, no idea how well it handles large things
