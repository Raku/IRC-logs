[21:13] <FROGGS> jnthn: the "is rw" fails to get applied btw at: rakudo/src/core/traits.pm:342:            my $meth := method (|c) is rw {

[21:15] <jnthn> It's some arglist corruption bug afaict

[21:15] <jnthn> Sadly, my Sunday got nabbed dealing with preparing for the fill-in teaching tomorrow that I've had dumped on me :/

[21:15] <lizmat> :-(

[21:16] <jnthn> "Can you do a guest lecture on Mon?" "Um...sounds OK." "OK, it's from 8:15am until 3pm." "WTF????" :)

[21:18] <FROGGS> hehe

[21:18] <jnthn> This is going to feature a high amount of live coding. It's a fairly beginners-level group so I figure I can pull it off. :)

[21:19] <jnthn> hm, my slides don't contain a dugong yet...

[21:20] <lizmat> dang!

[21:21] <FROGGS> why should your slides contain that ooc?

[21:21] <jnthn> FROGGS: They just seem to feature unusually often when I teach C# related things. :)

[21:21] <jnthn> For no good reason at all :)

[21:22] <FROGGS> O.o

[21:22] <jnthn> There is at least a haiku in here somewhere...
