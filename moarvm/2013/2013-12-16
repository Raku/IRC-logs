[07:47] <jnthn> JimmyZ: If we're lucky, it'll be one of the already-found-but-not-fixed bugs.

[07:47] <jnthn> And even if it isn't, I suspect the auto-whacker will get tthere

[07:49] <timotimo> i looked into capsicum yesterday (just watched the presentation, actually), so i was wondering if moarvm or rakudo in general could have some super nice capability management facilities

[07:49] <timotimo> that would be pretty darn cool

[07:49] <timotimo> otherwise, i suppose it'll be doable enough to just use the native syscalls

[08:03] <JimmyZ> good morning, jnthn

[08:05] <FROGGS> timotimo: reconfiguring helped, thanks :o)

[08:06] <timotimo> there really ought to be something that automatically tells you to do that, would get rid of so much confusion

[08:06] <JimmyZ> auto-whacker?

[08:09] <timotimo> nwc10++ made a tool to automatically try re-building with ever-decreasing nursery sizes

[08:11] <JimmyZ> oh, I saw it. nice tool.

[08:13] <JimmyZ> it's nicer to add to MoarVM by some configure options

[08:27] <nwc10> jnthn: I have another, but not diagnosed it yet. I guess this is stating the obvious, but if Win32 lets one do the same memory permissions tricks, your laptop could join in the fun.

[08:29] <jnthn> teaching, bbl

[09:43] <jnthn> nwc10: I probably *could*, but scaling things beyond me is always helpful :)

[09:43] <jnthn> nwc10: And at the moment we seem to be achieving that ;)

[09:50] <nwc10> only sort of. I was hoping that we'd scale beyond me too (in that, I think that a couple of others on the channel understood where to fix the problems it can spot)

[09:52] <nwc10> I was also starting to be suspicious that the handle SEGV is not a GC bug

[09:58] <jnthn> nwc10: The one I fixed last night?

[10:21] <nwc10> yes

[10:22] <nwc10> as best I can tell, the GC bugs are deterministic, for deterministic input

[11:24] <nwc10> the handle bug is only really fixed on Win32? Because it needs something that libuv doesn't yet have for *nix?

[11:25] <FROGGS> or unix does not suffer from it

[13:32] <[Coke]> do we want reports of build warnings?

[13:43] <[Coke]> anyone building nqp-m on os x? I just got a build failure. (seems to work fine on diakopter's linux box, though)

[13:58] <jnthn> [Coke]: Build failure in NQP or in Moar?

[14:36] <nwc10> "to whom it may concern", I'm not currently finding (more) GC bugs, because I'm not able to fix the ones I did find. I was hoping someone else (and someone not jnthn) would be provide input there

[14:36] <nwc10> so if you think you're waiting for me, you're deadlocked  :-)

[14:46] <[Coke]> jnthn:  nqp, I think.

[20:27] <[Coke]> Segmentation fault

[20:27] <[Coke]> make: *** [CORE.setting.moarvm] Error 139

[20:28] <[Coke]> (from today's rakudo-m build - I was getting to perl6-m on previous days.

[20:28] <[Coke]> (on host06)

[20:30] <nwc10> do you have a core dump?

[20:31] <nwc10> (either way, it's probably a garbage pointer in ...->handle, which seems to be a non-deterministic bug, I think caused by thread timing races)

[20:32] <[Coke]> nwc10: I don't see a core file, nope.

[20:36] <lue> nwc10: I'm having a similar segfault issue, or at least did. Not sure how it stopped, all I know is it stopped after using gdb.

[20:38] <nwc10> I'm seeing the crash sometimes, and not other times

[20:54] *** FROGGS joined
[20:56] <FROGGS> nwc10: it would be 573km by car

[20:58] <FROGGS> jnthn: I sort of implemented $*OS and $*OSVER, but now I get "Cannot assign to immutable value" or some such... is that known?

[20:58] <FROGGS> that is when compiling Test.pm I think

[20:59] <FROGGS> the tests itself complain about prostcircumfix:<( )> or so

[21:11] <FROGGS> jnthn: btw, would it be okay if we take perl's $^O and put it in our generated config file?

[21:13] <FROGGS> hmmmm, or we do what parrot does..., trying to execute things like `/sbin/sysctl -n kernel.osrelease`

[21:13] <FROGGS> dunno how we get Windows's version

[21:14] <[Coke]> `ver` ?

[21:14] <[Coke]> that gives me "Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]" on this win 7 box.

[21:16] <FROGGS> and what do we put in $*OSVER ?

[21:16] <FROGGS> 6.1.7600 ?

[21:16] <[Coke]> I think that's not unreasonable.

[21:16] <[Coke]> since the other option is "Windows 7" or "Windows Server 2008 R2"

[21:17] * [Coke] points at wikipedia's Ver_(command)

[21:17] <FROGGS> I think the latter is specced as DISTRO.name

[21:18] <FROGGS> https://ethercalc.org/wrwsbhvuim

[21:18] <FROGGS> I created that spreadsheet to imagine how these objects might look like from reading the spec

[22:27] <jnthn> So I spent the evening in oelrepubliken instead of fixing GC bugs.

[22:29] <jnthn> FROGGS: See backlog if you missed my comment

[22:29] <FROGGS> k

[22:31] <jnthn> BTW, one of the sanity tests also produces a "could not assign to immutable value" error

[22:32] <FROGGS> k, so it is not my fault :o)

[22:32] <FROGGS> (in theory)

[22:33] <jnthn> No, doubt it

[22:33] <jnthn> I didn't get chance to track it down yet

[22:34] <jnthn> And tonight I...went to a place with a beer menu in the hundreds. :)

[22:34] <diakopter> gah

[22:34] <jnthn> Should have time tomorrow evening or in next couple of days, though :)

[22:34] <jnthn> Tomorrow is last day of teaching for the year.

[22:34] <diakopter> wonderful time to download next mac os x update, Apple... while I'm on plane wifi.

[22:35] <timotimo> :D

[22:35] <jnthn> In fact, tomorrow is last day of teaching until some time in 20th-ish of Jan. :)

[22:35] <timotimo> just hope it doesn't crash during the installation

[22:35] <timotimo> recovery could be a bit harder than usual in that case!

[22:35] <jnthn> ...the plane, or the OSX update? :D

[22:35] <diakopter> -_-

[22:36] <diakopter> ^ a tongue-in-cheek grimace ;)

[22:37] <jnthn> :)

[22:37] <diakopter> -_-p

[22:38] <diakopter> draw one on the wall!

[22:39] <FROGGS> hmmm... what movie was that?

[22:40] <diakopter> Beetlejuice, and probably others

[22:40] <FROGGS> looks like I need to watch it again :o)

[22:40] <diakopter> or 3 times..

[22:41] <FROGGS> yeah, I remember that

[22:42] <diakopter> 2.8Mbps isn't bad..

[22:43] <diakopter> er, 3.2!

[22:43] <jnthn> It's fast, but it's not full fart...
