[19:09] <dalek> MoarVM: implemented op say_fhs

[19:31] <hoelzro> I'm having some (minor) issues building MoarVM on my laptop

[19:31] <hoelzro> I'm getting a linker error because the libraries weren't compiled with -fPIC

[19:32] <hoelzro> it's easy enough to deal with, but I would expect that Configure.PL would detect this and add it to the Makefile?

[19:32] <FROGGS> hoelzro: make realclean and then reconfigure && make

[19:32] <FROGGS> hoelzro: it was added to the Makefile, but only like two weeks ago

[19:33] <hoelzro> I see

[19:33] * hoelzro tries

[19:34] <hoelzro> there we go!

[19:34] <hoelzro> thanks FROGGS

[19:34] <FROGGS> :o)

[20:06] <FROGGS> btw, I am fixing the windows build atm
