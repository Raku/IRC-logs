[00:00] <[Coke]> nwc10: I can build and install moar on os x, but then NQP dies horribly trying to use it.

[00:00] <[Coke]> (it's looking in bin, not lib, for libmoar)

[00:02] <lee__> [Coke]: i was able to get around that by using --static when configuring moar

[00:02] <lee__> though it isn't really fixing the problem

[00:40] <[Coke]> anyone working on getting nwc10++

[00:40] <[Coke]> 's patches applied?

[05:06] <diakopter> [Coke]: I'll look at tonight

[07:01] <cxreg> is moar going to be the first rakudo with non-blocking i/o?

[07:05] <cxreg> looks to me like the jvm doesn't support that feature

[07:38] <moritz> there's NIO

[11:22] <nwc10> FROGGS: is there any easy way to specify optimisation levels such as -Os or -Og using MoarVM's Configure.pl? It seemed that it wanted them to be numbers.

[11:30] <FROGGS> nwc10: let me fix that

[16:58] <FROGGS> hmmm, I should try v5 on moar these days...

[17:05] <jnthn> ooh, yes :)

[17:05] * jnthn is looking at the other two nwc10++ patches too

[17:07] * jnthn wonders if some of these will get us able to build on the roast machine

[17:08] <FROGGS> ohh, hi jnthn :o)

[17:10] <FROGGS> v5 has a build system since about 30 hours... so it is the right time to try moar (and jvm)

[17:35] <jnthn> nwc10: What size are we down to by now? :)

[17:39] <FROGGS> the -O3 && BOOTSTRAP.pm error is still there fwiw

[17:39] <jnthn> ugh :(

[17:40] <FROGGS> -O1 still works on my box

[17:41] <jnthn> FROGGS: Is that error still tehre with all the nwc10++ patches I just applied?

[17:41] <FROGGS> I pulled and tried just before telling it

[17:42] <jnthn> ok

[17:42] <jnthn> I dunno if the nursery size thing is being done with Rakudo and NQP builds or just NQP at the moment...

[17:42] <diakopter> .

[17:43] <jnthn> FROGGS: What opt level do we default to?

[17:43] <FROGGS> to 3 since a few hours

[17:44] <jnthn> Should we not default to something that works? :)

[17:46] <FROGGS> :o)

[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM: 81c749c | (Tobias Leich)++ | Configure.pl:

[17:49] <jnthn> If I configure with --debug I get:

[17:49] <jnthn> Option debug requires an argument

[17:49] <jnthn> See --help for further information

[17:49] <jnthn> But --help tells me...

[17:49] <FROGGS> :(

[17:49] <jnthn> --debug

[17:49] <jnthn> --no-debug

[17:49] <jnthn> Toggle debugging flags during compile and link. Debugging is off by

[17:49] <jnthn> default.

[17:50] <timotimo> yay moarvm commits

[17:54] <diakopter> [Coke]: I guess I won't look at those tonight.. :)

[17:55] <FROGGS> nwc10: do you need to be able to pass a string to --debug too?

[17:59] <diakopter> has moar-support been merged?

[17:59] <jnthn> no

[18:12] <timotimo> there's still a segfault when trying to build Test.pm (but possibly after finishing the build ...)

[18:14] <timotimo> (and again: --stagestats fixes it)

[18:14] <timotimo> but i can make-^H m-install completely when i add --stagestats to all of the steps

[18:14] <timotimo> `~j

[18:15] <timotimo> make m-spectest tries to rebuild Test.pm, though ... so unless i edit the Makefile, it won't do the spectest run at all

[18:27] <timotimo> i do get a bunch of succeeding tests!

[18:38] <FROGGS> you could fudge them while you're at it

[18:39] <timotimo> oof

[18:39] <timotimo> i'll try to look into a null pointer use in radix.t instead

[18:39] <FROGGS> good luck :o)

[18:39] <timotimo> actually, it would be good if i took a typing break

[18:39] <timotimo> my wrists have had to endure some pretty bad posture in the last two weeks

[18:42] <FROGGS> yeah, I had that too recently

[19:16] <FROGGS> jnthn: we only have one lib_path which get prepended to .moarvm file lookups... but we need two :o(

[19:18] <nwc10> jnthn: NQP built with a 3K nursery in about 4 hours

[19:18] <nwc10> the builds for 2K and 1K are still running

[19:18] <nwc10> was not building Rakudo due to that nagging handle heisen-SEGV

[19:18] <nwc10> but the second build passed

[19:19] <nwc10> and SEGVs in the next step (Test.pm) with what looks like the side effects of a missing write barrier

[19:19] <nwc10> (this is for a 64K nursery)

[19:21] <nwc10> may not get a chance to look at that for 48 hours

[19:44] *** colomon joined
[20:19] *** arnsholt_ joined
[20:41] <nwc10> 2K took 8h25

[20:41] <nwc10> 1K only started 6h20 ago so probably has a while to run.

[20:44] <FROGGS> nwc10: do you need to be able to pass a string to --debug too?

[20:48] <nwc10> oh, sorry, no, not aware of any debug flags that are strings

[20:48] <nwc10> just -g -g1 and -g3 IIRC

[20:50] <FROGGS> k

[20:50] <FROGGS> then I will have a fix for -O defaults..

[21:01] *** colomon joined
[21:10] <[Coke]> recent changes have more-borked things on the daily run box, now it's failing in nqp again.

[21:10] <[Coke]> (for some time it was failing on loading Test.pm)

[21:11] <FROGGS> [Coke]: that might be duie to the optimize level... I am about to push a fix

[22:34] * jnthn back

[22:35] <jnthn> FROGGS: ooh, you did a "make install" thing?

[22:35] <FROGGS> yes

[22:36] <FROGGS> btw, for parrot we install stuff like Perl6::Grammar to install/nqp/lib, but for jvm and moar in install/perl6/lib... shouldn't it go into nqp/lib because it is a nqp module?

[22:38] <FROGGS> I have trouble using Perl6::Pod and Perl6::Grammar in v5 because nqp-m does not find it :o(

[22:39] <jnthn> FROGGS: Seems reasonable to me...they're to be loaded by the NQP module loader

[22:40] <FROGGS> k

[22:43] <lue> FROGGS++ (must recompile r-m now â˜º)

[22:43] <FROGGS> lue: I hope it works out

[22:48] <lue> The only other issue I remember having was that the install directory structure didn't totally respect UNIX conventions (i.e. the <installdir>/languages directory), but I'll have to see what's changed first.

[22:52] <lue> FROGGS: I need to switch from to moar_libpaths in MoarVM and rakudo it seems, right?

[22:52] <lue> s/from//

[22:53] <FROGGS> lue: only if you want to execute perl6-m outside of the rakudo directory

[22:53] <FROGGS> so, no, not now

[22:54] <lue> FROGGS: actually, I do :) Additionally, I should probably update my perl6-p by now, which requires outside-install...
