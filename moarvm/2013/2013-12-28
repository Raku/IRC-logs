[23:38] <jnthn> nwc10: Thanks for the patches; I'll take a look over them/apply them tomorrow, most likely :)

[23:47] <timotimo> hey, actually

[23:48] <timotimo> i have a friend who knows about compiler stuff and debugging and automated bugfinding and stuff

[23:48] <timotimo> *maybe* he can help me whip something up to automatically find gc and write barrier problems in moar?

[23:48] <timotimo> i should ask him

[23:48] <jnthn> Well, the more bugs we find, the better :)

[23:48] <timotimo> sure

[23:49] <timotimo> he'll be back to this table in a few minutes i hope
