[14:24] <hoelzro> how does one determine how far Mokudo gets into the setting, anyway?

[14:24] <hoelzro> I've only been getting cryptic error messages

[14:24] <moritz> iirc the error comes from applying a trait

[14:25] <moritz> so count where the first trait is applied

[14:25] <hoelzro> ah ha =)

[14:26] <hoelzro> I didn't know if there was a magic tool or something

[14:26] <hoelzro> it just takes good old fashioned sleuthing

[14:28] <moritz> we don't add backends so often to warrant writing extra tools for that :-)

[14:28] <hoelzro> fair enough =)

[14:29] <hoelzro> I'm curious about contributing to Moar/Mokudo, but the barrier to entry seems so high

[14:29] <hoelzro> also, ENOTIME

[14:30] <FROGGS> hoelzro: once we get further there will be a lot to fix and for everyone's taste :o)

[14:30] <hoelzro> hehe

[14:30] <FROGGS> atm there is a problem with signature binding that I think only jnthn++ can fix

[14:32] <nwc10> If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire ...

[17:51] <[Coke]> j(nthn) team? p(perl6) team? m(oar) team?

[17:56] <diakopter> o_O

[17:56] <jnthn> .oO( In my day it was (a)bort, (r)etry, (f)ail... )

[17:58] <diakopter> I always confused abort and fail

[17:58] <diakopter> .oO( so does fail mean it's going to retry, if abort means it's not going to retry? )

[18:00] <jnthn> I *think* abort terminated the program, while fail gave it a shot at handling the error.
