[00:25] <timotimo> well, i could just implement GatherIter! that's probably totally easy and simple!!!!!kkk

[12:44] <jnthn> timotimo: To help with GatherIter, just implement continuations...

[12:46] <timotimo> sometimes i implement ten continuations before breakfast!

[12:52] <FROGGS[mobile]> I implemented continuations in PHP and VBA for fun!

[12:55] <jnthn> take_a_continuation_here()

[12:56] <jnthn> So, no dalek reported them, but last night I pushed two commits starting to work on the serialization reposession stuff.

[12:58] <FROGGS[mobile]> Ohh, nice

[12:58] <FROGGS[mobile]> I have no tuits till late evening

[12:59] <jnthn> I have some tuits this afternoon, but am kinda in recovery mode from the last weeks being busy...

[13:01] <jnthn> So, how did repo work... :)

[13:03] <FROGGS[mobile]> Yeah, I feel the same... >8h work plus >4h hackory plus kids is not ideal when you have a cold for weeks

[13:04] <FROGGS[mobile]> I actually started last night glueing it to panda

[13:04] <FROGGS[mobile]> Works nice so far

[13:05] <jnthn> Oh, I was talking about repossession... :)

[13:05] <jnthn> But cool that *that* repo work is going well... :)

[13:05] <FROGGS[mobile]> Ahh, w/e :o)

[14:51] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[14:52] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[15:05] *** grondilu joined
[15:12] <jnthn> Hm, a half-implemented stable reposession thing actually gets us further...

[15:13] <jnthn> Oh...I can guess why. But we really need the other bit. :)

[15:15] <timotimo> at least it's stable

[15:16] <jnthn> :P

[15:39] <jnthn> "Gaps in STable root set not allowed"

[15:39] <jnthn> OH YES IT IS

[15:42] <diakopter> ?

[15:43] <jnthn> diakopter: I'm just implementing stuff

[15:43] <jnthn> And running into my own lack of foresight. Or maybe laziness :)

[15:46] <jnthn> Seems we reach line 2560 when loading the setting now...

[16:08] <jnthn> Implemented slurpy/LoL-slurpy biding, but then the same thing soon runs into needed nqp::p6listitems doing. :)

[16:10] <FROGGS[mobile]> slurpy biding?

[16:10] <jnthn> *@foo

[16:10] <FROGGS[mobile]> sounds like I am missing all the fun

[16:32] <jnthn> p6listitems done

[16:32] <jnthn> Next: p6arrfindtypes NYI

[16:38] <nwc10> when I run it under valgrind, I'm getting grumblings about the base64 writing routine

[16:38] <nwc10> simplest fix - get rid of base64? :-)

[16:39] <jnthn> That's on my hit list at some point in the not too distant future.

[16:39] <jnthn> We already spec'd the alternative storage mechanism in the bytecode file, after all...

[16:39] <FROGGS[mobile]> does that play well with MVMString?

[16:39] <FROGGS[mobile]> ahh

[16:40] <jnthn> Well, the idea is to just shove the binary blob directly into a segment of the bytecode file.

[16:42] <timotimo> that should improve our bytecode file sizes significantly

[16:43] <jnthn> Aye.

[16:43] <jnthn> And our startup time. :)

[16:44] <timotimo> and our valgrind time

[16:44] <jnthn> Though sorting out the bottlenecks in CORE.setting compilation is more pressing.

[16:45] <jnthn> I need to focus on some indy stuff on Mon/Tue though.

[16:45] <nwc10> is killing base64 clear enough and sufficiently spec'd that someone else could do it?

[16:45] <jnthn> Not really...

[16:46] <jnthn> I'm not quite sure how it should look...

[16:46] <jnthn> Like, the getting the blob between serializer and file...

[16:48] <timotimo> stash it away until a later point, together with a stubbed forwards reference, then when emitting, spit out the data and go back in the file to fix the reference? :\

[16:48] <timotimo> that sounds bad.

[16:49] <jnthn> Yes, it does :P

[16:49] <jnthn> So yeah, it's more a design task...

[16:49] <timotimo> emit a length field and skip that many bytes when deserializing?

[16:49] <jnthn> p6arrfindtypes done

[16:49] <timotimo> \o/

[16:49] <jnthn> timotimo: We probably want to just pass a compunit into the deserializer or something in that direction...

[16:50] <jnthn> The other direction - I guess a byte array could do it...

[16:50] <jnthn> P6opaque: no such attribute '$!storage'

[16:50] <jnthn> Hmm. Innerestin...

[17:12] <jnthn> d'oh...

[17:12] <jnthn> Think I found it.

[17:12] <jnthn> port-o

[17:19] <jnthn> OK, up to line 3239 of the setting load now

[17:19] <jnthn> p6setautothreader NYI

[17:21] <timotimo> mhhh junctions

[17:21] <timotimo> setautothreader just passes a reference to a sub to a statically known location, so that the dispatcher can find it when a dispatch fails?

[17:21] <timotimo> you'll be able to implement that in a minute or two :)

[17:21] <jnthn> Yeah, it won't take long

[17:22] <jnthn> But I also should head out soon

[17:22] <timotimo> maybe i'll do it for you :)

[17:22] <timotimo> a few hints and i'll see what i can do

[17:22] <jnthn> Meeting a friend for l'öl

[17:22] <jnthn> Well, it's a binder thing

[17:23] <jnthn> So it wants handling by turning it into a method call on the Binder in BOOTSTRAP

[17:23] <jnthn> Which can then stash it

[17:23] <TimToady> .oO(a 3-ring circus binder)

[17:23] <jnthn> In a lexical.

[17:24] <timotimo> that BOOTSTRAP is backend-agnostic?

[17:24] <jnthn> ish

[17:24] <jnthn> The bit in question is maor only

[17:25] <jnthn> Writing the binder in C on Moar would be an epic disaster for my sanity... :)

[17:25] <jnthn> Nobody should do that much CPS transforming by hand... :)

[17:25] <timotimo> hah, ok

[17:25] <TimToady> 'course, you wanna talk about hot spots then...

[17:26] <jnthn> TimToady: Well, the Evil Plan is to optimize away the full-blown binder in the common case of signature binding.

[17:26] <TimToady> sometimes sanity is overrated

[17:26] <jnthn> TimToady: So if you end up in the full thing you're already going to be doing lots of more costly sutff anyway.

[17:26] * TimToady watches out for excess foil

[17:27] <jnthn> I'll probably actually work on that optimizing away this week, given I probably need it to for taking advantage of the indy stuff I'm plotting.

[17:27] <jnthn> Nice that the need to do it for JVM means we get it for Moar too. :)

[17:28] <TimToady> indystuff++

[17:28] <timotimo> \o/

[17:28] <jnthn> Anyway, by putting the binder into BOOTSTRAP, the symbols are all handily available and once we get the specializer stuff into Moar it should be able to do nice things on this code. It's also full of native types where possible, which is nice for JIT when we get that. :)

[17:28] <TimToady> reminder to folks following along at home: "indy" is short for invoke dynamic

[17:28] <timotimo> \o/

[17:29] <timotimo> so, er, i could just implement p6setautothreader with QAST instead of C, right?

[17:30] <timotimo> can i just find Binder with Var/WVal?

[17:30] <jnthn> timotimo: oh, totally

[17:30] <timotimo> it'll be a lexical, aye?

[17:30] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, see many other examples in src/vm/moar/Perl6/Ops.nqp

[17:31] <jnthn> Aye, inside class Binder

[17:31] <timotimo> perfect :)

[17:32] <timotimo> i meant Binder, rather than the lexical for the autothreader

[17:32] <timotimo> the latter is already a my $autothreader inside the Binder class

[17:33] <arnsholt> What's invoke dynamic entail on Moar, OOC?

[17:33] <jnthn> arnsholt: invoke dynamic is a JVM thing, not a Moar thing.

[17:34] <jnthn> arnsholt: It's used to teach the JVM about other languages and how they work, so its JIT can make sensibler decisions about that to do with them.

[17:34] <jnthn> Moar is just built with 6model stuff right in the core

[17:34] <timotimo> do i need to update moar and nqp to get from 7c81a62..7832310?

[17:34] <jnthn> You certainly need a new moar

[17:34] <timotimo> OK

[17:35] <TimToady> do any of the VMs allow storage layout at the bit level yet?

[17:35] <TimToady> s/allow/provide/ :)

[17:35] <jnthn> Not from Perl 6 land...I suspect the JVM must have classes in the library for bit buffers...

[17:37] <TimToady> and I suppose we also don't have compact int arrays smaller than 8 bits yet either

[17:37] <timotimo> i don't think we do, no

[17:37] <jnthn> No

[17:38] <jnthn> Well, we don't have native arrays anywhere yet really.

[17:38] <TimToady> btw, who actually does commit bits? I have a combinations routine that runs 6 times faster

[17:38] <jnthn> Buf and Blob are like that

[17:38] <jnthn> Oh wow...

[17:38] <jnthn> TimToady: github ID?

[17:38] <TimToady> TimToady

[17:38] <jnthn> lemme see if I can

[17:38] <timotimo> oh that seems like a nice addition :3

[17:39] <TimToady> well, I showed it to quietfanatic++, and he said "Why don't you make the recursive solution faster instead?"

[17:39] <jnthn> TimToady: You should be able to push now

[17:39] <timotimo> hah :)

[17:40] <timotimo> well, when jnthn makes the binder "inlinable" on jvm and moar, recursive stuff should be a lot faster for everything, no?

[17:40] <TimToady> oops, pushed to moar-support instead of nom

[17:40] <TimToady> oh well, I guess it'll all end up the same place

[17:40] <timotimo> eventually, sure

[17:41] <timotimo> Internal error: invalid thread ID in GC work pass

[17:41] <timotimo> ... huh

[17:41] <jnthn> Yeah. Well, merge early, merge often...once you can "say 'hi'" on Moar, there'll be little reason not to merge the moar-support branch, provided it regresses no other backend.

[17:41] <jnthn> timotimo: That error tends to mean "memory corruption".

[17:41] <timotimo> yeah :(

[17:41] <timotimo> so re-build without --optimize?

[18:59] <timotimo> another 10 minutes of compilation ... :|

[18:59] <FROGGS[mobile]> you are using $*W.find_sym?

[19:00] <timotimo> which may very well be wrong

[19:00] <timotimo> but i won't have it in the world, will i?

[19:01] <timotimo> because $*W.find_sym is what gets used when you have a Var with :scope<lexical>

[21:26] <FROGGS> jnthn: can you review that patch please? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/05eaefe8431547a1b7eabfed44b959c3051ba4d2

[21:28] <FROGGS> yeah, it must be that: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/05eaefe8431547a1b7eabfed44b959c3051ba4d2#diff-db8462d383c5c121ed6763f510fa4804R61

[21:45] <jnthn> Given you assign them at startup?

[21:49] <FROGGS> jnthn: it will be false for the very first time, no?

[21:49] <jnthn> If you do

[21:49] <jnthn> instance->stdin  = MVM_file_get_stdin(instance->main_thread);

[21:50] <jnthn> It will never be NULL after taht?

[21:50] <jnthn> And startup occurs before we run any ops...

[21:50] <jnthn> oh, ahng on, I see...

[21:50] <jnthn> But if we're only meant to call them once...

[21:50] <FROGGS> I can do it better, yes

[21:50] <jnthn> If's safer to complain about a second call...

[21:51] <jnthn> Or just write a setup_std_handles function in there that is called from bootstrap that does it.

[21:51] <jnthn> uv_run(tc->loop, UV_RUN_NOWAIT);

[21:51] <jnthn> What's the NOWIAT actually mean here?

[21:51] <FROGGS> it won't block if there are no pending requests

[21:53] <jnthn> OK, seem reasonable, now I glance the docs

[22:23] <FROGGS> <FROGGS> Internal error: invalid thread ID in GC work pass

[22:24] <FROGGS> there is an item in the worklist that has a weird owner

[22:25] <FROGGS> if I dereference it once more, it almost looks sane (before it had size=0, afterwards it had size=168 and type=10)

[22:25] <jnthn> Weird..

[22:25] <FROGGS> except that its REPR name if unreadable

[22:25] <FROGGS> yeah

[22:25] <jnthn> Yeah, sounds corrupte

[22:26] <FROGGS> and this seems to introduce it: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/05eaefe8431547a1b7eabfed44b959c3051ba4d2#diff-db8462d383c5c121ed6763f510fa4804R61

[22:26] <FROGGS> especially what now is in setup_std_handles

[22:27] <jnthn> Odd. Looks like they're correctly added as perm roots...

[22:28] <FROGGS> hmmm, when I comment out the setup_std_handles now, it complains about STDERR not beeing initialized... so something is "using" it

[22:30] <FROGGS> ahh, that still might be the stuff in nqp

[22:36] <jnthn> Hm, something is weird with the pow_I impl

[22:40] <FROGGS> what exactly?

[22:40] <FROGGS> I could imagine that Inf and -Inf are not corret

[22:47] <FROGGS> sounds doable, yes :o)

[22:50] <FROGGS> btw, what makes me think that my filehandles are to blame is that the corrupt item in the worklist appears after calling MVM_gc_root_add_permanents_to_worklist in collect.c line 73

[22:51] <jnthn> Does the filehandle thing itself have a gc_mark?

[22:52] <FROGGS> the MVMOSFilehandle? no

[22:52] <FROGGS> err, MVMOSHandle

[22:53] <FROGGS> so, it needs to add something to the worklist? yes?

[22:53] <jnthn> Well, only if it refs anything...

[22:54] <FROGGS> no, don't think so

[22:57] <jnthn> oh wow, how on earth did we get away without having attribute auto-viv stuff this long...

[22:57] <FROGGS> :o)

[23:03] <jnthn> Building a hopeful fix for this...we should be past line 6000 at startup with this...

[23:03] <FROGGS> cool!

[23:08] *** colomon joined
[23:10] <jnthn> Grr.

[23:10] <jnthn> Fixing the misisng auto-viv breaks stuff.

[23:11] <FROGGS> :(

[23:27] <FROGGS> jnthn: this adds the corrupt obj to the worklist: MoarVM/src/gc/collect.c:355:        MVM_gc_worklist_add(tc, worklist, &new_addr_st->WHO);

[23:29] <jnthn> o.O

[23:30] <jnthn> Odd

[23:32] <FROGGS> I added that right before the mentioned line:

[23:32] <FROGGS> if (new_addr_st->WHO && new_addr_st->WHO->header.owner > 0)

[23:32] <FROGGS> printf("ohh noes! %d\n", new_addr_st->WHO->header.owner);

[23:32] <FROGGS> and it comes out like:

[23:32] <FROGGS> ohh noes! 28410216

[23:32] <FROGGS> sending a handle 0x1b1a958 to object 0x7f2a04d085d8 to thread 28410216

[23:32] <FROGGS> Internal error: invalid thread ID in GC work pass

[23:44] <FROGGS> this was called by MoarVM/src/gc/collect.c:288

[23:46] <jnthn> Thing is, it probably copied that corruption from the object's old location...

[23:46] <FROGGS> yeah :/

[23:48] <jnthn> Meanwhile, I might have some progress on the auto-viv container thing

[23:48] <jnthn> But getting tired...

[23:48] <FROGGS> me too (not the progress, the other thing)

[23:49] <FROGGS> okay, the thing comes from the if (item_gen2) { branch

[23:49] *** BenGoldberg joined
[23:51] <jnthn> grrr

[23:51] <FROGGS> so all I know is that it already is in the worklist :/

[23:51] <jnthn> My fix didn't help at all...

[23:51] <FROGGS> ó.ò

[23:54] <diakopter> jnthb: are you spawning threads?

[23:55] <jnthn> diakopter: Me? No...though it's FROGGS looking at the thing with the owner. But no threads...

[23:55] <jnthn> Just corruption.

[23:56] <jnthn> Oh...I see what's up...

[23:56] <diakopter> whew

[23:56] <jnthn> (with the auto-viv thing)

[23:57] <jnthn> (not FROGGS's thing)

[23:57] <jnthn> Grr, that's gonna be some "fun"...

[23:57] <diakopter> wut

[23:57] <FROGGS> ":/"

[23:57] <jnthn> I didn't get around to putting in the attribute auto-viv thing

[23:57] <jnthn> And we're accidentally relying on it not working in one place in regex code-gen

[23:58] <jnthn> "fun" 'cus I think it may need a trip around the bootstrap loop to fix

[23:59] <jnthn> Anyway, too tired to do that today.
