[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM: 7496b56 | (Tobias Leich)++ | Configure.pl:

[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM: make -O1 the default instead of -O3 as long as we have that gc bug

[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM:

[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM: There is a gc bug about an MVMStaticFrame that explodes on linuxes

[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM: under -O3. Hopefully it builts on TimToady++'s machine now, too.

[18:54] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7496b56ec8

[18:54] <TimToady> we'll see...

[18:55] <FROGGS> yeah :S

[18:56] * lue remembers something about premature optimization :)

[18:57] <FROGGS> hehe

[18:57] <FROGGS> premature -O3 ?

[18:57] <TimToady> is O1 default?  because there seems to be no -O1

[18:58] <FROGGS> TimToady: -O1 should be the default when --optimize=\d is not supplied

[18:58] <TimToady> ain't

[18:59] <TimToady> course it doesn't tell me most of the commands

[18:59] <FROGGS> hmmm

[18:59] <FROGGS> ohh, hmmm

[19:00] <FROGGS> well...

[19:00] <TimToady> but there's no -O in the Makefile

[19:00] <FROGGS> but then I don't understand why it explodes on your box at all

[19:00] <FROGGS> (not that I understand why it explodes on my box using -O3)

[19:01] <TimToady> are you exploding in m-BOOTSTRAP?

[19:01] <FROGGS> yes

[19:02] <FROGGS> https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/8efa32fce9e288e9f7f0

[19:03] <FROGGS> this way

[19:03] <TimToady> looks about the same

[19:03] <TimToady> trying with an explicit --optimize=1

[19:04] <TimToady> but my nqp wants to recompile everything now...

[19:06] <FROGGS> you could skip that if you did not use --gen-nqp/--gen-moar

[19:07] <FROGGS> I am decreasing the nursery size now... maybe I discover something

[19:17] <TimToady> -O1 doesn't help

[19:17] <FROGGS> damn

[19:49] <FROGGS> Object does not exist in serialization context

[19:49] <FROGGS> at gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:3828  (/home/froggs/dev/rakudo/../nqp/install/languages/nqp/lib/QAST.moarvm:deserialization_code:24)

[19:49] <FROGGS> O.o

[22:55] <diakopter> FROGGS: that's an interesting one

[23:03] <FROGGS> I just added a BEGIN { nqp::say(nqp::x("a", 1024)) } in src/gen/m-BOOTSTRAP.nqp line 44
