[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: Implement captureposprimspec.

[21:21] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0909d9a80e

[21:23] <jnthn> "Cannot call trait_mod:<is>; no signatures match"

[21:23] <jnthn> Progress, of a sort...

[21:24] <FROGGS> *g*

[21:24] <FROGGS> cool

[22:03] <FROGGS> okay, on windows we get the full path:

[22:03] <FROGGS> C:\rakudo>C:\nqp\install\bin\nqp-m.bat --target=mbc --output=blib/Perl6/Metamodel.moarvm --encoding=utf8  src/gen/m-Metamodel.nqp

[22:03] <FROGGS> filename = C:\nqp\install\languages\nqp\lib\nqp.moarvm

[22:03] <FROGGS> filename = C:\nqp\install\languages\nqp\lib/ModuleLoader.moarvm

[22:04] *** lue joined
[22:04] <FROGGS> ahh, maybe a relativ --prefix is busting it?

[22:07] <jnthn> Oh...maybe?

[22:08] <FROGGS> hmmm

[22:09] <FROGGS> no, the ModuleLoader thing was just my fault...

[22:10] <FROGGS> but it gives me an exit code 1 now without an error message :/

[22:10] <dalek> MoarVM: 7c2561f | jnthn++ | src/ (3 files):

[22:10] <dalek> MoarVM: Prepare for more complete istype handling.

[22:10] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7c2561fae6

[22:15] <FROGGS> only valgrind does output something, but not sure if that is helpful: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/aa0e679d876fb59379d7

[22:22] <FROGGS> FROGGS-- # this introduces it: e9b79b0... fix printfh/sayfh bug (segfault on linux)

[22:42] <dalek> MoarVM: 9eb6c53 | (Tobias Leich)++ | src/6model/reprs/MVMOSHandle.c:

[22:42] <dalek> MoarVM: unbreak rakudo build

[22:42] <dalek> MoarVM:

[22:42] <dalek> MoarVM: Now it will explode again during shutdown on some machines after printing to std-handles.

[22:47] <FROGGS> This type does not support elems

[22:47] <FROGGS> trait_mod:<is>

[22:47] <FROGGS> I am happy :o)

[22:47] <jnthn> Wonder where that's coming from...

[23:13] <FROGGS> jnthn: seems to be a signature like: multi trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D $r, |c ) {

[23:15] <FROGGS> jnthn: it is the trait in traits.pm line 86-97

[23:15] <jnthn> Well, wiht the latest we get:

[23:15] <jnthn> This type does not support elems at <unknown>:1  (blib/Perl6/World.moarvm:trait_mod:<is>:4294967295)

[23:16] <FROGGS> if you comment line 86 to 97, you get: Cannot call trait_mod:<is>; no signatures match

[23:17] <jnthn> Thing is, it's not actually giving that error inside of the binding stuff

[23:24] <FROGGS> so it might be something in Perl6::World method apply_trait?

[23:27] <jnthn> I think it may be in the thunk...

[23:27] *** cognominal joined
[23:30] <jnthn> .oO( what the thunk... )

[23:32] <jnthn> FROGGS: Oh, innerestin...

[23:32] <jnthn> FROGGS: It's coming from flatten_args

[23:34] <FROGGS> the I wonder why nqp did not hit that

[23:36] <jnthn> oh, I wonder if it's a usecapture/savecapture distinction...

[23:37] <jnthn> I'll bet it is...
