[09:41] <nwc10> Unhandled exception: Cannot invoke this object

[09:41] <nwc10> ... :-/

[09:41] <nwc10> and I also hit the garbage value in handle compiling the setting on a previous attempt, resulting in SEGV

[09:41] <nwc10> the one we think is caused by a GC bug

[09:42] <nwc10> sorry to rain/snow/hail (a bit) on your parade

[09:42] <nwc10> but, still

[09:42] <nwc10> \o/

[09:42] <nwc10> works on one machine.

[09:59] <FROGGS> nwc10: yes, the bug in the handle is not fixed yet

[10:38] <jnthn> nwc10: What branches did you build? There's a patch in indy-args that is needed...

[10:39] <jnthn> nwc10: Also, you can add --ll-exception to what you ran to get more useful info on what's really wrong...

[10:40] <nwc10> nqp was master. I didn't realise that I needed indy-args for MoarVM

[10:40] <nwc10> did get a "Hello world" on a different machine

[10:40] <nwc10> (which I can't directly paste here)

[10:40] <nwc10> it's just there -->

[10:42] <nwc10> r: say "Hi from $*OS"

[10:42] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 262e60: OUTPUT«Hi from Linux␤»

[10:42] <camelia> ..rakudo-parrot 262e60: OUTPUT«Hi from linux␤»

[10:42] <nwc10> but that one hangs chewing CPU

[10:42] * nwc10 re-re-builds

[10:46] <jnthn> yeah, I put the patch in indy-args by accident

[10:47] <jnthn> Then figured, ah, we'll merge it soon anyway... :)

[13:18] <jnthn> Oooh, white stuff...

[13:19] <nwc10> we had some earlier

[13:24] <jnthn> Doesn't seem to be sticking. The wind is still rather strong.

[13:24] <nwc10> ours hasn't stuck around. It melted

[13:24] <nwc10> Pesky daystar :-)
