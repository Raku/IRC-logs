[00:21] * [Coke] thinks now is a great time to fix moar!

[00:21] <timotimo> isn't it always? :)

[00:24] <[Coke]> I have 2 hours to kill and a laptop and wifi

[00:24] * [Coke] tries to see if he can track down this nqp-m segfault

[00:25] <[Coke]> looks like moar builds by default with -g - is there a way to get more debug symbols?

[00:28] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/7903006

[00:33] <[Coke]> minor bugnit, can't use a relative path when configuring nqp-m --prefix

[00:39] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/7903139 - actual line numbers and stuff. whee.

[00:39] <TimToady> yes, I discovered this a week or two ago

[00:40] <TimToady> it's worse when configuring from the rakudo level

[00:40] <[Coke]> is there an open bug? my bad.

[00:40] <[Coke]> oh, the relative path thing

[00:40] <[Coke]> the bug is reporting from             OP(isinvokable): {

[00:42] <[Coke]> from inside that block, but that might be macro'd too much for me just now.

[00:42] <TimToady> is this while compiling the rakudo setting?

[00:43] <[Coke]> updated https://gist.github.com/coke/7903139 with the func args.

[00:43] <[Coke]> TimToady: this is a segfault building nqp-m

[00:43] <[Coke]> (current stopper on the daily roast machine)

[00:43] <TimToady> are you in master?

[00:44] <TimToady> and are you using MoarVM master?

[00:45] * TimToady configures his rakudo with: perl Configure.pl --backends='parrot,jvm,moar' --prefix='/home/larry/nom/install' --gen-parrot --gen-nqp=master --gen-moar=master

[00:45] <TimToady> undetected version skew can cause problems in nqp-m

[00:46] <[Coke]> I'm just trying to build nqp, not rakudo.

[00:46] <TimToady> on what arch?

[00:46] <[Coke]> I don't specify, so I would expect to be getting master on moar.

[00:46] <[Coke]> whatever host06 is... checking...

[00:46] <[Coke]> Linux host06 3.5.0-17-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 9 19:31:23 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

[00:46] <TimToady> specifying master explicitly has seemed to matter sometimes to me

[00:47] <TimToady> dunno why

[00:47] <[Coke]> what branch of rakudo are you on?

[00:48] *** cognominal joined
[00:49] * [Coke] wipes ./nqp and tries again with TimToady++'s config (minus parrot,jvm)

[00:50] <[Coke]> TimToady++ # cargo culting done right.

[00:51] <[Coke]> I wonder if we need to bump the required version in both places.

[00:53] <TimToady> nom

[00:53] <[Coke]> ah. that's probably my problem. I was on moar-support on rakudo.

[00:53] <TimToady> oh, wait, so am I, duh

[00:53] <[Coke]> bet that is old and has an old nqp ref.

[00:54] * [Coke] ah, whew, I had one thing right.

[00:54] * [Coke] tries to build rakudo-m

[00:54] <TimToady> but install/ gets confused when you switch branches, so you generally have to blow it away

[00:54] <TimToady> the various configures and the various makes are not interacting well with git

[00:55] <[Coke]> I start fresh every day, so I have a slight advantage.

[00:55] <TimToady> on mine I get up to where rakudo wants to compile m-BOOTSTRAP, and get a heap corrpution

[00:56] <TimToady> on WindowsÂ® people seem to get as far as compiling the setting

[00:56] <[Coke]> Heap corruption detected: pointer 0x2aba5552acf8 to past fromspace

[00:56] <[Coke]> so now I'm caught up to now.

[00:57] <TimToady> yeah, please fix that one :D

[00:57] <TimToady> which both jnthn++ and diakopter++ seem to run away from screaming...

[00:58] <TimToady> (they get karma for being entertaining, y'see)

[01:08] <diakopter> :) it's not that I run from that screaming, it's that I run toward everything else screaming

[01:09] <TimToady> berserkers...

[01:18] *** japhb_ joined
[01:27] <[Coke]> diakopter: can we get valgrind on host06?

[01:31] <TimToady> okay, I'm not in the sudoers list, and this incident will be reported.  :)

[01:37] <diakopter> REPORTED

[01:39] <diakopter> [Coke]: done

[01:59] <[Coke]> diakopter++

[02:02] <[Coke]> I am going to wish I captured the output of that command...

[02:06] <[Coke]> valgrind sez: https://gist.github.com/coke/7904039

[02:08] * [Coke] reruns with -v and --leak-check=full, but is unsure if valgrind noticed the heapcorruption

[02:28] *** benabik joined
[02:32] <[Coke]> here's a more verbose run: http://feather.perl6.nl/~coke/barf.out

[02:37] <[Coke]> I wonder how many of those losses are due to the crash from the heap corruption

[02:37] <TimToady> fix the crash and we'll know :P

[02:40] <TimToady> but I'd guess your guess is right

[02:48] <[Coke]> so, I can't gdb it (no backtrace), and valgrind isn't helpful. I think this is the point where I run away screaming.

[02:48] <diakopter> [Coke]: well if the global destruct phase doesn't run, nothing get freed

[02:49] <[Coke]> I wonder if I need to do a gdb run and just step through the whole thing until it splodes.

[02:49] <diakopter> it won't help track down the problem

[02:49] <TimToady> trouble is that something is leaving a timebomb

[02:50] <TimToady> incorrectly rooted or some such

[02:51] <TimToady> or somebody is assuming something doesn't move when it does

[02:56] <[Coke]> diakopter: pointers on how to solve it most welcome. I was just hoping to find the place where it exploded.

[02:58] * [Coke] packs up for the commute home.

[07:07] *** FROGGS joined
[07:11] <FROGGS> [Coke]: valgrind is not helpful because all happens in our allocated area, so there is no suspicious invalid read or so...

[07:11] <FROGGS> [Coke]: but this was interesting: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/8efa32fce9e288e9f7f0#file-past_fromspace-bash-L25

[07:11] <FROGGS> [Coke]: the exploding thing is an MSMStaticFrame

[09:16] *** odc joined
[10:14] <nwc10> is it worth creating a way to make the GC very agressive, and (at least) do a nursery sweep at every point it might do one

[10:14] <nwc10> to rapidly show up unrooted thingies

[10:14] <nwc10> yes, I realise that this will be slow

[10:15] <nwc10> but it's probably faster than how a developer currently finds porblems

[10:15] <nwc10> or even just valgrind

[10:15] <FROGGS> it might help insofar you would hit the wrongish thing earlier

[10:15] <FROGGS> at least that is what I'd hope

[10:28] <diakopter> nwc10: sure, just decrease the nursery size pathologically

[16:01] <nwc10> good UGT, jnthn

[16:03] <jnthn> Mostly, hunting the GC bug from my side blocks on a chunk of undistracted time I can dedicate to it. :)

[16:09] * jnthn managed to attend talks by the creators of Erlang and Eiffel this week :)

[16:16] <timotimo> cool :)

[16:17] <timotimo> something good to steal for perl6 or moarvm perhaps?

[16:18] <jnthn> Well, the Erlang one had some good stuff on fault tolerance.

[16:20] <timotimo> that's always cool

[16:20] <timotimo> perl6 could learn a bit of marketing from Outlaw Techno Psychobitch.
