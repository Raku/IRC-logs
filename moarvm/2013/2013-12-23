[00:30] <FROGGS> perl t/harness --fudge --moar --keep-exit-code --tests-from-file=t/spectest.data

[00:30] <FROGGS> t/spec/S01-perl-5-integration/basic.rakudo.moar ............... ok

[00:30] <FROGGS> t/spec/S02-lexical-conventions/begin_end_pod.t ................ ok

[00:31] <FROGGS> it still works for me

[01:34] <[Coke]> FROGGS: do you have an account on host06 ?

[01:35] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I'm not sure

[01:35] <FROGGS> need to check (tomorrow)

[08:44] <FROGGS> seems this will go one for a while :o)

[08:49] <nwc10> several days

[08:49] <nwc10> It will go faster with http://paste.scsys.co.uk/286834

[08:49] <nwc10> which I think should have been there in the first place

[08:50] <nwc10> the Makefile defines a macro PROVE, but then never uses it

[09:33] <nwc10> FROGGS: if you are running it, I think it's unlikely to be that good at telling you *why* there's a problem unless you apply the hacked-up mmap patches I sent to the list a few days ago, and possibly also that patch that aborts() in the write barrier if the new pointer is in fromspace

[09:49] <FROGGS> k

[09:49] <FROGGS> will do

[09:50] <JimmyZ> src/vm/moar/ops/perl6_ops.c:367: error: too many arguments to function ‘MVM_frame_find_invokee’

[09:50] <JimmyZ> make: *** [dynext/libperl6_ops_moar.so] Error 1

[09:50] <JimmyZ> I got this

[09:56] <FROGGS> how on earth...

[09:59] <FROGGS> nwc10: ahh, I need to copy the diffs out of the mails?

[10:01] <FROGGS> ahh no, there are three patches in your mail from 15.12.

[10:39] <timotimo> nwc10: what keeps you from commiting your local patches to a branch of moarvm so that it's easier to try it out locally?

[10:50] *** cognominal joined
[10:50] <FROGGS> timotimo: I fear he has no commit bit

[10:51] <FROGGS> and I dunno who can hand them out

[10:51] <FROGGS> Non-zero wait status: 139

[10:51] <timotimo> well, fortunately one can fork repositories on github :)

[10:51] <FROGGS> is succeeds under gdb and valgrind  :o(

[10:52] <timotimo> i can make mokudo compile the test library when i add --stagestats >_>

[10:55] <timotimo> i'm confused. i run the same command make outputs with --stagestats and make wants to run it again and fails

[10:57] <FROGGS> timotimo: yeah, it wants to rebuild Test.moarvm almost every time

[10:57] <FROGGS> I have no idea why though

[11:11] <timotimo> i remember there's a gcc plugin or script or something that can spot misuse of reference counting in cpython extensions

[11:11] <timotimo> maybe we can look at their code and do something similar for moarvm garbage collecting

[11:40] <timotimo> the gcc python plugin developer seems to commit stuff every now and then, but not terribly much
