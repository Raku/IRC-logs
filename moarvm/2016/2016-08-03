[08:26] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[08:52] *** zakharyas joined
[09:16] <jnthn> good * :)

[09:16] * jnthn has Perl 6 tuits for the rest of the day :)

[09:17] <nwc10> \o/

[09:19] <nwc10> jnthn: the bad news is that even with your thread thingy indirection fixes to MoarVM last week, t/spec/integration/advent2013-day14.t can still hang

[09:19] <nwc10> much less often, it seems

[09:19] <nwc10> but still the same strange one where thread 14 is in epoll

[09:19] <nwc10> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/528760

[09:20] <jnthn> It's possible that is the event loop thread...

[09:21] <jnthn> Yeah, it is

[09:21] <jnthn> It looks more like a legit deadlock to me

[09:22] <jnthn> btw, in the future it'd be useful to do: thread apply all where

[09:22] <jnthn> Which gets the stack traces of all the threads, not just the ones that are hopefully the interesting one to know about :)

[09:46] <jnthn> nwc10: The maybe good news is that the test there does a react/whenever involving a channel, which is also the case in the sometimes-hang of S17-supply/syntax.t

[09:47] <jnthn> (Which is what I'm fixing in my branch)

[09:47] <jnthn> So if we're lucky it's the same root cause for both.

[09:49] <jnthn> I can run S17-supply/syntax.t in a loop while a parallel spectest with TEST_JOBS=12 also runs and it doesn't hang ever, which is promising :)

[09:50] <jnthn> t/spec/S17-supply/throttle.t still needs me to golf it down, alas :)

[10:10] <jnthn> Seems I've uncovered a genuine bug in throttle, which is another of those "how did this ever work" ones

[10:28] <jnthn> Merged those fixes

[10:28] *** dalek joined
[10:29] <jnthn> Now going to do a spectest and, concurrent with it, a load of runs of t/spec/integration/advent2013-day14.t :)

[10:36] <nwc10> I've had one sitting in a loop for about an hour (obviously not with the fixed code) and I can't get it to lock up to do that gdb thing for you

[10:36] <nwc10> so will now try new stuff

[10:39] <jnthn> OK

[10:39] <jnthn> I can't get it to either fwiw

[10:39] <jnthn> But S17-supply/syntax.t would about one in 20 times

[10:39] <jnthn> After the fixes I can't make it do it at all

[11:29] <nwc10> no new ASAN barfage

[11:29] <nwc10> t/spec/S32-str/encode.rakudo.moar is in RT

[11:30] <nwc10> ASAN tolerates you, and does not yet feel the need for a reshuffle: http://cattime.com/trending/17125-larry-the-cat-stays-at-10-downing-street-as-david-cameron-resigns

[11:31] <nwc10> (first picture)

[11:37] <jnthn> And no hangs? :)

[11:37] <nwc10> no, not in two runs

[11:39] * jnthn wonders if Larry the cat voted to remain in the meuw

[11:42] <jnthn> Man, which concurrency issue to pick next...

[11:42] * jnthn analyzes the S32-io/IO-Socket-Async.t occasional failure

[11:42] <nwc10> several of them, at the same time?

[11:43] <nwc10> also, I admit defeat on trying to follow up on your cat pun.

[11:44] <nwc10> (although that actually might be a feed line for this:)_

[11:44] <nwc10> it should be furly easy, but somehow I just can't think of anything that works.

[11:58] <jnthn> Seems the failure is because the closing of the server socket happens asyncronously, meaning that the request to open a new listening socket on the same host/port can beat the completion of the closing by a whisker, thus the instability.

[12:15] <nwc10> jnthn: is it likely that you've addressed the cause of RT #127947 ?

[12:15] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127947

[12:25] <jnthn> It's possible, though worth stress-running that test case somewhat too

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM: 85b6537 | jnthn++ | src/io/asyncsocket.c:

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix lost socket listen errors.

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM:

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM: For example, "address already in use" could get lost, which is not

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM: helpful.

[13:08] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/85b65376c6

[13:10] <jnthn> And that's why the test wasn't failing in a more useful way when it failed.
