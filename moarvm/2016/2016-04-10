[14:44] <nine> What kind of breakage am I looking for when I get a "Expected MAST::Frame, but didn't get one"?

[15:43] <nine> (gdb) p operand->st->debug_name

[15:43] <nine> $21 = 0xa1ed00 "NQPMu"

[16:02] <nine> Seems to be a "getcode" op

[16:29] <nine> Ok, seems like we're missing the frame for the EVAL's <unit> Block

[16:31] <nine> And it seems like there's only a single place where we store a frame in %!mast_frames
