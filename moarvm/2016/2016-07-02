[09:23] <brrt> hmm, another idea... can't we share value descriptors between nodes

[09:31] <brrt> hmm

[09:31] <brrt> actually, that brings us back to the array-of-things issue again

[09:31] <brrt> i'm fairly sure we can do better than that

[09:31] <brrt> maybe...

[09:31] <brrt> oh, i know

[09:31] <brrt> we keep value descriptors in an array

[09:32] <brrt> and keep an array of nodes to descriptors in the array

[09:32] <brrt> oh wait, we don't have to do the first thing

[09:33] <brrt> hmmmm....

[09:35] <brrt> doing reverse lookup (from value descriptor to node) isn't actually ever necessary, i think

[09:35] <brrt> although

[09:35] <brrt> no, it is necessary, unfortunately

[09:35] <brrt> when we are spilling

[09:38] <brrt> hmm, i'll mull over this some more

[19:29] <lizmat> jnthn: looks like RT #128522 indicates a casualty of the method cache refactor
