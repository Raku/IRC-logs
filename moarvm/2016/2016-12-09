[00:09] <timotimo> oh those headings

[00:30] <timotimo> we're hearing of pulao (apparently another name for pilaw) for the first time, and it appears on first glance to just be risotto, but not using "risotto rice"

[00:34] <timotimo> and apparently you put in like 20 different kinds of spice

[14:44] <dogbert17> jnthn: are you still around?

[14:49] <dogbert17> .tell jnthn It looks as if https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/58cdfd80b30444ba4755bb3fa0992f0f449f8a9e breaks t/spec/S17-procasync/no-runaway-file-limit.t. Is it ok with you if we revert that fix?

[14:49] <yoleaux2> dogbert17: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[20:03] <nine> timotimo: your commit fea28ed247c7756d4fe4313f329af91681b4a3a6 "implement throwpayload* in the JIT" breaks Inline::Perl5 :/

[20:04] * babydrop saw that referenced elsewhere too

[20:04] <babydrop> somethign with namespacing I think

[20:04] * babydrop rakes recent tickets

[20:21] *** pyrimidine joined
[21:03] *** pyrimidine joined
[21:47] <timotimo> oh? crap!

[21:47] <timotimo> nine: is that "just" bisected or also with jit disable and such? :S

[21:50] <nine> timotimo: MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 fixes the issue

[21:51] *** pyrimidine joined
[21:52] <timotimo> ;_;

[21:52] <timotimo> and reverting the commit on top of the latest master also fixes it, i expect?

[21:57] <nine> timotimo: confirmed

[21:58] <timotimo> ;_;

[21:58] <timotimo> feel free to push the revert, then

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM: 8627dd1 | niner++ | src/jit/graph.c:

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM: Revert "implement throwpayload* in the JIT"

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM:

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM: This reverts commit fea28ed247c7756d4fe4313f329af91681b4a3a6 which breaks

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM: Inline::Perl5's tests and apparently causes other issues, too.

[22:00] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8627dd13da

[22:00] <timotimo> what, other issues?

[22:04] *** domidumont joined
[22:18] <babydrop> oh, I totally forgot I went to rake for tickets.....

[22:18] <babydrop> I think ugexe found some sort of namespace bug that bisected to that commit.

[22:21] <babydrop> Oh, never mind. Ugexe's thing was this one: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ab946945735042ff99953f6636bdf98acd5bfc71

[22:21] <babydrop> And "the other" that I recall was pyrimidine bisecting the bug with Inline::Perl5 doh >:)

[22:37] <timotimo> ok
