[00:01] <timotimo> m: say 19768 / (19768 + 36992)

[00:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 855de7: OUTPUT«0.348273␤»

[00:01] <timotimo> so about a third of deserialized p6opaque reprdata space used for auto_viv_values have nothing but zeroes in them

[00:10] <timotimo> there's already a flag that says "should the auto_viv_values be grabbed from the serialized blob at all?"

[00:10] <timotimo> a varint

[00:10] <timotimo> it could easily store an extra value that says "build the array out of zeroes, please"

[00:11] <timotimo> that'd save one ref per attribute, which is at least one byte for the descriminator and in this case probably nothing else ... hmm.

[00:12] <timotimo> so the first number above divided by 8?

[20:15] <TimToady> that'll teach me to type without putting my glasses on, or more likely, not
