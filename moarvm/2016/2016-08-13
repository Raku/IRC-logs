[19:00] <mst> hrmf

[19:00] <mst> do we configure the 3rdparty bits at 'make' time?

[19:00] <mst> that's ... odd

[19:06] <TimToady> jnthn is an odd person, but we keep him around anyway because he has a luscious accent

[19:26] <mst> I'm committing pretty much the same sin

[19:26] <mst> just a layer further out

[19:28] <jnthn> "It builds. Be happy!" :-)

[19:30] <jnthn> I *think* it's only dyncall that's doing it, and it may not be much work to make it happen at some other point.

[19:41] <mst> jnthn: I want it to build *and* not make downstream people hate me

[19:41] <mst> however, I'm getting somewhere anyway

[20:01] <mst> heh, the NQP build docs tell me it 'installs to the same place as parrot'

[20:15] <mst> ...

[20:18] <mst> ok, nqp doesn't actually honour --prefix to its configure

[20:18] <mst> wonderful

[20:19] <timotimo> um ... it doesn't? o_O

[20:20] <mst> it seems to really really expect moar to be in the exact same prefix

[20:20] <mst> I'm now applying hackery

[20:24] <mst> ok

[20:25] <mst> that sort of works

[20:25] <mst> but now it's trying to build installed files

[20:26] <mst> make: *** No rule to make target `/blah/share/nqp/lib/MAST/Ops.nqp', needed by `gen/moar/stage1/MASTOps.moarvm'.  Stop.

[20:26] <mst> wtf

[20:29] <mst> oh for FUCK's sake that .nqp file is in MoarVM

[20:30] <timotimo> oh

[20:30] <timotimo> yeah, of course it is

[20:30] <timotimo> it's generated from the op list

[20:30] *** zakharyas joined
[20:31] <mst> that would be fine if it was looking for it where I said --with-moar

[20:32] <mst> but it's looking for it in --prefix

[20:32] <mst> this is a trainwreck

[20:32] <timotimo> right, obviously we've never thought to try --with-moar vs --prefix before :)

[20:32] <mst> also moarvm didn't install a lib/MAST/Ops.nqp

[20:32] <mst> so even if I fix that, it still won't work

[20:32] <timotimo> huh

[20:32] <timotimo> that's strange, it really should, though

[20:33] <mst> ooooh

[20:33] <mst> FOUND IT

[20:33] <mst> stupid me looked in lib

[20:33] <mst> misunderstood the paths

[20:33] <mst> right

[20:34] <mst> getting there.

[20:36] <mst> also nqp has no --bindir option

[20:36] <mst> because ... because

[20:38] <timotimo> it doesn't make binaries :P

[20:38] <mst> uh, wtf is nqp-m then?

[20:39] <timotimo> just a shell script

[20:39] <mst> which means --bindir should exist for that.

[20:39] <mst> please don't make such stupid jokes

[20:39] <mst> it's not funny when I'm four hours in

[20:48] <mst> GODDAMNIT IT WROTE A Makefile with 'PREFIX =' again

[21:05] <mst> also setting BIN_DIR for Makefile is insufficient because --bindir doesn't exist so install-moar-runner.pl gets the wrong target dir

[21:06] <mst> (complaining out loud, I'm working around it fine, I'll do patches later)

[21:17] <mst> ROCK ON

[21:17] <mst> This is nqp version 2016.07 built on MoarVM version 2016.07

[21:17] *** brrt joined
[21:18] <brrt> hey mst, for whom are you making a release? :-)

[21:25] <mst> brrt: CPAN

[21:25] <brrt> you're going to put rakudo on CPAN?

[21:25] * mst is attempting to script starball -> Alien::NQP, Alien::MoarVM, Alien::Rakudo

[21:25] <brrt> that is cool

[21:25] <mst> yeah, I did it once already, but it sucked because parrot

[21:26] <brrt> oh well, i'll leave you to your frustrations

[21:26] <mst> hey, two out of three

[21:26] <brrt> :-P

[21:26] <mst> tomorrow is rakudo, then using App::opan to test them against the fresh 5.24 I compiled earlier

[21:27] <brrt> uhuh

[21:28] <brrt> and then for a bigger splash, Inline::Perl6?

[21:28] <mst> nine already shipped that

[21:28] <brrt> on the CPAN?

[21:28] <mst> http://p3rl.org/Inline::Perl6

[21:29] <mst> that's what's motivating me to reconstruct all this

[21:29] <mst> make it possible for people to use perl6 in perl5 programs just by adding three Alien:: dists plus the Inline:: one to their cpanfile

[21:29] * mst wants this to get at the grammar engine ;)
