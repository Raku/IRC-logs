[03:36] <diakopter> I invited yoleaux but nothing happened

[03:38] <diakopter> timotimo: ^

[03:39] <diakopter> timotimo: english "running with scissors"

[03:41] <japhb> diakopter: Slightly different -- timotimo's idiom sounds like he's not running with the blade, but rather encountered it while running

[03:51] <geekosaur> running into a brick wall

[03:53] <japhb> geekosaur: Certainly closer, though timotimo's idiom indicates the result is death (or at least dire injury) rather than being stopped (and possibly knocked down or out)

[03:54] <geekosaur> true. I think the closest you get from that angle is "running over/off a cliff"

[03:54] <japhb> Yeah, that seems closer still.

[03:55] * japhb is getting his first personal Perl 6 hacking time in a while and is tickled pink about it

[08:04] <yoleaux2> japhb: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[08:05] <yoleaux2> 06:51Z <Zoffix> japhb: done

[08:05] * japhb wonders why the original yoleaux did nothing ...

[08:05] <Zoffix> Oh neat. I didn't realize it passed messages across channels.

[08:06] <japhb> Yeah, it's a nice feature.

[08:06] <japhb> (And part of why I like this particular message-passing bot, when people tend to be in several Perl 6 related channels but not active in all of them.)

[15:23] * Zoffix was napping and had a dream MoarVM got released.

[15:23] <Zoffix> Turns out I'm not psychic when I sleep :P

[15:39] <TimToady> maybe it was about the future

[15:39] <yoleaux2> 14 Oct 2016 16:31Z <p3rln00b> TimToady: I've added tests for uninitialized num pre/post ++/-- that expect the values to be NaN. If that's incorrect behaviour, let me know and I'll amend them: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/2a3cdb2e257e97d8c6dafefecc8f6221f87da80f/S02-types/num.t#L215-L217

[21:31] <jnthn> Zoffix++ # nqp and rakudo releases :)

[21:32] <lizmat> m: say "12345".match(/./,:nth(1000))    # shouldn't that be Nil ?

[21:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1acf5b: OUTPUT«False␤»

[21:32] <Zoffix> Just gonna do one dry test on my test forks and then do the real one.

[21:33] <jnthn> m: say "12345".match(/6/)

[21:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1acf5b: OUTPUT«Nil␤»

[21:33] <jnthn> Woulda thought so :)

[21:34] <timotimo> jnthn: did you see the "prevent_double_unlock_multi_cache_add" commit? because apparently it fixed the *BSD crashes

[21:35] <timotimo> and i have no idea how that is even possibly a fix at all

[21:36] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, I'm a bit confused by it too :/
