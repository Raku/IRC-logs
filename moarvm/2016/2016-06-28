[10:42] <timotimo> it's not very encouraging that my rebased and fixed-up version of line based coverage gives me "chars requires a concrete string, but got null" when i run it on some random test

[10:49] <timotimo> and i'm having trouble getting gdb to break on that exception being thrown

[10:54] <nwc10> build with ASAN and see if it explodes earlier?

[10:54] <nwc10> or faster, use valgrind on the binary you have already

[10:55] <timotimo> right, that would probably be a good idea

[10:55] <timotimo> OK, i got it to break

[10:55] <nwc10> \o/

[10:55] <timotimo> by making it not MVM_STATIC_INLINE any more

[11:13] <timotimo> ah, i got it

[11:13] <timotimo> i was grabbing a string from the strings list without asking it to be deserialized if needed

[19:07] <brrt> hmmpf

[19:07] <brrt> i have an issue

[19:08] <brrt> a group in my university is botching up my work

[19:08] <brrt> i kind of shouldn't care, because it doesn't matter

[19:09] <brrt> and... yet i care

[19:10] <brrt> and i don't have the time to fix it for them, at all

[19:10] <timotimo> :|

[19:11] <timotimo> it's hard being the best in a group, isn't it?

[19:11] <timotimo> i woudn't know, though

[19:11] <timotimo> i've only been in groups with absurdly talented, skilled, and gifted people so far

[19:16] <brrt> well, i didn't mean it like that

[19:17] <brrt> what i meant was: my thesis work has been gaining some attention from people who would like to advertise the data online

[19:17] <brrt> which is fine by me

[19:17] <brrt> s/advertise/publish/

[19:17] <brrt> the problem is, they have no idea about what the data means or represents

[19:17] <brrt> and, i'm supposed to correct them

[19:18] <brrt> or something

[19:21] <jnthn> brrt: Misinterpreting it out of ignorance, or out of agenda?

[19:22] <brrt> probably ignorance

[19:22] <brrt> fairly certain ignorance

[19:22] <brrt> they're not bad people

[19:22] <brrt> they just want to nominate themselves for a prize with my data

[19:23] <brrt> and i don't know how to rescue this :-(

[19:23] <brrt> they're not going to win any prizes with what they've cobbled together for now

[19:26] <jnthn> Ugh

[19:26] <jnthn> Yeah...if there's no "hint in the right direction" that'll get them there, it's tricky.

[19:29] <brrt> it is

[19:29] <brrt> the thing that makes it more complicated is that my supervisor holds this group in high regard

[19:29] <brrt> otherwise i would've broken off communications long ago

[19:30] <jnthn> Did you manage to discuss it with your supervisor?

[19:30] <jnthn> Or is that awkward given he holds said group in high regard?

[19:35] *** diakopter left
[19:38] <brrt> well, i have, but he's on holiday now

[19:38] <brrt> and since then i haven't kept track of all they said

[19:38] <brrt> and all that's been done

[19:38] <brrt> it's my own fault, too, i just need to sleep far too often

[19:38] <brrt> :-P

[19:38] *** vendethiel joined
[19:40] <jnthn> Don't undervalue sleep :)

[19:41] * jnthn is pretty sure that's been part of his troubles

[19:41] <brrt> you wouldn't be the first

[19:52] <brrt> well, sent an e-mail

[19:52] <brrt> hopefully it helps

[19:53] <jnthn> :-)

[19:53] <jnthn> Best of luck with it.

[19:56] <brrt> thanks :-)

[20:07] * brrt is cooking chick peas for falafel

[20:07] <brrt> well, my cooker is cooking them, and i'm supervising

[20:08] <jnthn> oooh, nice :)

[20:09] <brrt> falafel is a great invention, i think

[20:22] <jnthn> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/378

[20:23] <jnthn> (Issue filed after private correspondence)

[20:25] <jnthn> I'll get to it, unless somebody fancies beating me to it.

[20:25] <jnthn> .oO( timobait! )

[20:25] <brrt> agreed with the comment

[20:26] <brrt> safety first

[20:26] <brrt> :-P

[20:30] <jnthn> Holy shit. :/ Bomb attack at Istanbul Ataturk.

[20:31] <jnthn> (Airport)

[20:31] <jnthn> Why is this so scary?

[20:31] <jnthn> Because my wife is traveling back home right now (literally, en route) from doing some uni stuff over in Ukraine. As it happens, she's traveling on the overnight train to Kyiv and the flight to Prague midday tomorrow.

[20:32] <jnthn> But we actually considered a route that goes from her city to that airport, then from there to Prague. o.O

[20:32] <jnthn> Not to mention that I connected a bunch of times there over the last year and a half. :/

[20:33] <hoelzro> jnthn: it's pretty scary stuff; I hope your wife's travels are uneventful

[20:35] <timotimo> god fuckign damn it :|

[20:36] <jnthn> Thanks. Me too...very unlikely this will affect her, thanks to the route we ended up picking. But scary that we considered an option that woulda seen her connecting at that airport this very evening. :/

[20:37] <jnthn> Guess we won't be considering it again...

[20:39] <timotimo> i can't imagine how heavy that can feel :o

[20:44] <TimToady> attacks like these are outside the secure area, so transfers are relative safe

[20:44] <jnthn> Well, given she'd have been in the secure area and transferring, not in the departure hall that got bombed, it'd likely have been "just" an uncomfortable and scary inconveneince.

[20:44] <jnthn> heh, TimToady beat me to it

[20:45] <jnthn> That said, on that route you do actually get turfed out of the secure zone and have to re-enter it when you're going in the Ukraine -> Istanbul -> EU direction. Curiously, in the EU -> Istanbul -> Ukraine direction you don't have to do security again.

[20:46] <jnthn> But even then you're not taken through the departure hall, it's a security queue for transferring folks.

[21:41] <timotimo> i need to run a script of sorts that publishes my desktop's ip address to a spot i can reach from anywhere :\

[21:43] <hoelzro> timotimo: your desktop's, or your home network?

[21:43] <hoelzro> if the latter, do you have a router running OpenWRT or similar?

[21:59] <timotimo> the router is a Fritz!Box

[21:59] <timotimo> it has support for dyndns already

[21:59] <timotimo> but i'm too lazy to be hassled with that again

[22:02] <hoelzro> heh

[22:02] <hoelzro> I have a little Lua script that runs nightly on my router that tells my Linode DNS setup where home is

[22:03] <hoelzro> I would happy to share it with you if you would find it useful

[22:04] <timotimo> nah, i have a one-liner in my history that just ssh's my ip into a text file on the same machine that runs my irc session

[22:11] <hoelzro> ah, that'll do it =)

[22:12] <timotimo> just have to actually run it :)
