[13:59] <brrt> ohai #moarvm

[14:00] <brrt> continuing our discussion of a week ago, i can suggest that creating a stack walker is very well possible, but it requires (afaik) a compiler flag to prevent the compiler from using only rsp as a stack marker

[14:00] <brrt> hmmm

[14:00] <brrt> in fact, not sure if that is true

[14:01] <brrt> nm, it's true enough

[14:01] <brrt> let me see what compile flag that was

[14:02] <brrt> -fomit-frame-pointer makes gcc omit the rbp-'storage'

[14:02] <brrt> -fno-omit-frame-pointer makes llvm not omit the rbp

[14:02] <brrt> dunno what that would be for microsoft

[14:05] <brrt> it would be /Oy for enabling, /Oy- for disabling

[14:06] <brrt> ok, let's keep that in mind
