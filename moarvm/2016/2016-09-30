[10:54] <psch> jnthn: can you look at moar PR #416?  https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/416

[11:06] <jnthn> Hm, that error could be a bit clearer/explanatory perhaps

[11:06] <jnthn> It'd be nice if it included the type name too

[11:06] <psch> right, as commented, the nqp-j equivalent has the class name, but i'm not sure how to do that on moar

[11:07] <psch> like, we don't have the convenient Ops.typeName afaict

[11:07] <psch> about explanatory... well, the test i pushed only checks the message for "no fields"

[11:08] <psch> i suppose we could explain why no fields are a bad thing for a CStruct

[11:08] <jnthn> Commented on the ticket

[11:09] <jnthn> Well, commit

[11:10] <psch> right, so that's to be a sprintf with %s for st->debug_name or so i gather?

[11:10] <jnthn> MVM_throw_exception_adhoc works printf-y :)

[11:10] <jnthn> So just pass it as an extra arg

[11:10] <psch> ah, okay

[11:11] <jnthn> It's C but we try to make it at least a tiny bit convenient :)

[11:14] <jnthn> lunch, bbiab

[22:40] <nebuchadnezzar> rakudo NativeCall tests fail on several architectures https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-rakudo-devel/2016-September/000970.html

[22:41] <nebuchadnezzar> when I try with a MoarVM build against libffi, I have some failure for amd64 and i386: https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-rakudo-devel/2016-September/000971.html

[22:42] <jnthn> i386 surprises me a bit

[22:42] <jnthn> libffi fails don't in so far as it's had a lot less testing

[22:42] <jnthn> I'm suspecting either alignment or endianness
