[19:55] <diakopter> hiii

[19:58] <brrt> hi diakopter

[19:59] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[20:01] <brrt> good fix jnthn :-)

[20:01] <brrt> subtle, too

[20:12] <Azry> Hi! I'm currently looking in p6 for a method to create a filehandle from a file descriptor. I can see that nqp oplist does the reverse, which corresponds to the "fileno_fh" line in the oplist. Is it planned to add such a method to p6/nqp in the future ?

[20:13] <jnthn> Azry: Not planned yet, but if there's demand for it, it should be possible to do.

[20:16] <lizmat> jnthn: if we could do that, could we get rid of special casing STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR ?

[20:16] <Azry> well, i'm trying to port io::pty to p6 and posix_openpt() gives me a file descriptor, so i would need it to create a proper IO::Handle. I don't know if that is a good enough reason

[20:20] <jnthn> Azry: Sounds reasonable enough to me

[20:20] <Azry> cool =)

[20:21] <jnthn> Azry: Not sure, without thinking about it some more

[20:22] <jnthn> oops

[20:22] <jnthn> lizmat: ^^

[20:22] <lizmat> jnthn: yeah, just pointing out maybe another benefit  :-)

[20:22] <Azry> ah ok lol

[20:22] <Azry> :(

[20:24] <Azry> ah, uh now i feel dumb

[20:24] <jnthn> Azry: Heh, no, I meant your request sounds reasonable enough, I was being unsure about lizmat's suggestion :)

[20:24] <Azry> =)

[20:24] * jnthn stops confusing folks and goes back to writing the heap profiler...

[20:24] *** Ven joined
[20:24] <lizmat> .oO( that'd be confusing enough :-)

[20:26] <jnthn> It's a bit like writing a garbage collector that doesn't bother to collect :)

[20:29] <Azry> so, do i have to register an issue on github, or something ?

[20:30] <jnthn> Azry: I'd file it in the Perl 6 RT (that is, as a Perl 6 feature request)

[20:31] <jnthn> That's where "full stack" things tend to go

[20:32] <Azry> okay i'll to it, thank you =)
