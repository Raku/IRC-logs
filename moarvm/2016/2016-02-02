[10:52] <timotimo> hey!

[10:53] <timotimo> i saw a tweet about your session

[10:53] <timotimo> seems like it was well visited

[10:58] <brrt> yeah, it was busy enough :-)

[12:03] <timotimo> now i wonderif "cracked" is just the typical dutch way to say "b0rked"

[12:03] <timotimo> i find it amusing, that the german "kaputt" sometimes crops up in english as "kaput" or similar

[13:06] <tony-o_> timotimo: isnt kaput the proper spelling?

[13:15] <jnthn> Only if your spelling is kaput :P

[13:15] <[Coke]> in english, kaput is proper, I think.

[13:15] <jnthn> :)

[13:16] <jnthn> Yeah, list most English borrowings, we give the spelling a good screwing up along the way :)

[13:16] <jnthn> *like most

[13:24] *** domidumont joined
[13:36] *** vendethiel joined
[13:41] <geekosaur> we can't even spell our own words correctly, much less yours :p

[13:46] <jnthn> win 12

[13:46] <jnthn> oops

[13:51] * flussence would like to get this small fix into moar (and rakudo) sometime, but has no idea how to keep Windows(/Mac?) happy: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/320#issuecomment-167796142

[13:59] <geekosaur> yeh, that won't fly on either windows or mac

[14:13] <flussence> Maybe I'm worrying about nothing, does --has-libffi even make sense to support on those? I thought the whole point it was added was to be able to run nativecall on esoteric systems, which wouldn't have either OS anyway

[14:15] <geekosaur> macs have libffi

[14:15] <geekosaur> includes are in /usr/include/ffi

[14:15] <geekosaur> but macs don't have pkg-config

[14:26] <tony-o_> libffi is installable via brew

[14:27] <tony-o_> re:kaputt - didn't know that, when i took german they spelled it with only the one 't'

[14:27] <arnsholt> A propos the previous discussion, one possible explanation of "kaput" vs. "kaputt" is that the German spelling was with a single t when it was borrowed into English

[14:27] <arnsholt> And then changed at some later point

[14:28] <tony-o_> did we take that word prior to ww2?

[14:28] <arnsholt> Prior to roughly the 1800s (IIRC), spelling was very variable

[14:29] <tony-o_> seems like a second 't' would change the pronunciation

[14:30] <arnsholt> Thing is, people were a lot less picky about that kind of thing up until relatively recently =)

[14:31] <geekosaur> only if there's a stable orthography. english didn't even pretend to have one before noah webster, and it's still not very reliable

[14:31] <geekosaur> I have no clue about thehistory of German orthography

[14:31] <moritz> it was also variable :-)

[14:31] <moritz> old texts use y where we use i now a lot

[14:31] <moritz> "seyn" instead of "sein" (to be)

[14:32] <tony-o_> maybe they just had poor hand writing

[14:32] <tony-o_> (joke)

[14:33] <tony-o_> now i'm going to be reading about orthography for half of today.

[14:33] <geekosaur> what letters/combinations map to what sounds, more or less

[14:36] <geekosaur> English has one, sort of, but it's honored in the breach more than the keeping (cf. the "ghoti" joke)

[14:36] <tony-o_> the ol' fish joke

[14:37] <geekosaur> (although imo that one only really proves that the orthography is complex and context-dependent)
