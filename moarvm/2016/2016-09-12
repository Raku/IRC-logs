[06:00] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[06:00] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[06:01] * brrt unfortunateky didnt bring his laptop while commuting

[06:01] <brrt> so no hacking... :-(

[06:01] <nwc10> more thinking time

[06:01] <brrt> aye.

[06:02] <brrt> and staring out of windows

[06:02] <brrt> as in, made of glass windows

[06:06] <brrt> isn't it funny how there are only a small number of options to solve nearly any problem...

[06:08] <brrt> caching is one. Moving from singulars to sets, and from sets to specially structured sets

[06:08] <brrt> is anothrer

[06:09] <nwc10> neither "another layer of indirection" nor "bigger hammer" seem to be in your list :-)

[06:09] <brrt> another layer of indirection is one :-) but not my favorite

[06:10] <brrt> very easy to get lost in those

[06:11] <TimToady> caching is an off-by-one-layer-of-indirection error :)

[06:11] <brrt> something like it but  not the same: 'move it to another phase'

[06:12] <nwc10> which is often useful, because that phase might be "never"

[06:12] * brrt has to ponder that for a bit

[06:12] <nwc10> don't ponder so hard that you miss your stop

[06:12] <TimToady> speaking of off-by-one

[06:13] <brrt> still have 20 minutes

[06:14] <brrt> practical suggestion: why not store the args in the buffer and compact them later

[06:14] <brrt> (that was only meant as a note-to-self)

[06:17] <brrt> nwc10: if I could summarise your talk it'd be 'without mug-throwing the perl community would have muddled through the last 15 years much like php and python and ruby'

[06:18] <nwc10> yes. instead of muddling through it a different way

[06:18] <brrt> ergo it would not have strived towards greatness like perl6 does

[06:18] <nwc10> I missed mentioning one thing that I'd put the clues in the slides for

[06:18] <nwc10> the "Cube" project starts in 2007

[06:19] <nwc10> why didn't it use/reuse the JavaScript VMs, or the approach taken, or whatever?

[06:19] <brrt> what was that again?

[06:19] <nwc10> Answer - the JS speed wars didn't start until 2009

[06:19] <nwc10> that was the sort-of-Parrot/Pynie/MoarVM

[06:19] <nwc10> with all the suble problems of Parrot/Pynie and MoarVM :-)

[06:19] <brrt> oh right. with the better vtables

[06:20] <nwc10> yes, but no threads

[06:20] <nwc10> because refcounting

[06:20] <brrt> oh yes

[06:21] * brrt wonders about TimToady's off-by-one

[06:21] * nwc10 suspsects it's an off-by-one error in his bed, which he's now corrected

[06:21] <TimToady> sounds more like it was an on-by-one error

[06:22] <nwc10> oh, I'm wrong

[06:22] <nwc10> keeps happening.

[06:22] * brrt takes his time to parse that

[15:43] <timotimo> any reason we're not moving stuff into a lib/ folder instead?

[15:45] <moritz> yes, more effort, larger diffs :-)
