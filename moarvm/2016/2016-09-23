[05:31] <brrt2> it is not very rich in detail unfortunately

[05:32] <brrt2> one of the thingw i like about moar is that the responsibilities of spesh and the jit are cleanly separated

[05:49] <nwc10> we have 2 brrts now? You've managed to clone yourself?

[05:50] <nwc10> Yay \o/

[10:55] <jnthn> timotimo: The threads form a linked list hanging off instance

[10:56] <jnthn> timotimo: Linked list 'cus it makes handling thread death easier than an array :)

[10:56] <timotimo> ah!

[10:56] <timotimo> well teaches me for just looking into Instance

[10:56] <timotimo> is that a sensible way to try to get profile data from all threads?

[10:56] <timotimo> or should i also look into marking the thread stolen or something like that?

[10:57] <jnthn> I think all threads *do* recording profiling data

[10:57] <timotimo> yes, they do record

[10:57] <jnthn> Or at least, can

[10:58] <timotimo> is it safe to just grab the data while the threads are potentially still running, though? :)

[10:59] <jnthn> Hmm

[10:59] <jnthn> Good question :)

[11:00] <jnthn> Potentially not :)

[11:00] <jnthn> Also those threads may end up with "unfinished business" in their call stacks

[11:00] <jnthn> Which may throw off timings etc.
