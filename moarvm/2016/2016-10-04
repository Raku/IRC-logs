[09:15] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[09:15] <brrt> today i'm going to try and implement the live range heap

[09:16] <moritz> I have no idea what that means, but it sounds exciting :-)

[09:16] <nwc10> are you wearing suitable protective clothing? :-)

[09:18] <brrt> hehehe

[09:18] <brrt> it's boringer than it sounds

[09:19] <brrt> i need a data structure to loop over the live ranges in first-definition ascending order

[09:19] <brrt> and i need to add live ranges as they come

[09:19] <brrt> hence, heap of live ranges

[09:20] <brrt> live_range.isa(DataRecord)

[09:26] <brrt> (but boring, for the record, is good, because it means I know what to do :-))
