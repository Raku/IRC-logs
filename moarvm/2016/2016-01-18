[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: Add compile-time platform check for JIT support

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM:

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: In issue #324, bus errors are reported when MoarVM is compiled

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: in a universal binary and runs on a 32 bit platform (OS X).

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: This adds a compile-time check for the platform, in the assumption

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: that the compiler will generate different code for each 'instance',

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: in which case it should disable the JIT support on 32 bit platforms.

[13:14] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6ae4e7fdb8

[20:23] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Breaking the golden rule, doesn't work yet, but outputs linear

[20:23] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: tile list. Spesh pool allocation for simplicity

[20:23] <brrt> if you want to know *why* the second of these commits doesn't work yet, it's because i'm not done with pseudotiles yet

[20:24] <brrt> last of these commits was nice fallout from the fact that linear order is now computed 'for free'

[20:27] <brrt> tile.c will want some renaming

[20:33] <brrt> but in general, progress

[22:05] <timotimo> what's that golden rule?

[22:06] <timotimo> anyway, i'm glad to see progress on the new jit :)

[22:06] <flussence> "don't commit stuff that doesn't compile"?

[22:06] <timotimo> ah

[22:06] *** kjs_ joined
[22:06] <timotimo> pff, whatever :)

[22:06] <timotimo> that's in a branch
