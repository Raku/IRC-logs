[07:32] <timotimo> ELEVEN KILOBYTES

[07:32] <timotimo> that's really not a small amount

[07:33] <timotimo> i've got a few ideas remaining for p6opaque's reprdata, btw

[07:33] <timotimo> like, there's a few fields in there that are sometimes just zeroes from start to finish

[07:34] *** domidumont joined
[07:34] <timotimo> i wanted to investigate a bit more. there's potentially a win in handling the special case of "there's just a single value in there", or "we can skip the first n values, because they're all zeroes"

[07:42] <dalek> MoarVM/serialization_int: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5ef8a547d9

[07:47] <JimmyZ> timotimo: looks a  good idea, i did see lots of zero in the moarvm code, though most of it is about opcode itself. ;)

[07:47] <JimmyZ> *looks like

[09:52] <nine> jnthn: I think, I got the source of the num_temproots underflow: src/core/nativecall_dyncall.c callback_handler before the MVM_gc_root_temp_mark tc->num_temproots is 5, after MVM_gc_root_temp_mark_reset it is 3

[09:54] <nine> Narrowed it down to the call to MVM_interp_run

[10:07] <JimmyZ> any +1 to merge serialization_int branch?

[10:15] <nine> Btw. in one of Inline::Perl5's tests tc->num_temproots goes up to 709

[10:15] <lizmat> JimmyZ: sorry, but I don't think I'm qualified to give a +1 or -1 or whatever   :-(

[10:21] <JimmyZ> nine: I guess some where MVMROOT { MVM_interp_run } never  return and in MVM_interp_run it calls another MVMROOT { MVM_interp_run } and never return again and continue call another one :P

[10:36] <nine> It does not fail always but when it does, it's missing 2 temproots

[10:44] <nine> I think it's exceptions.

[10:45] <nine> The MVM_gc_root_temp_pop_all(tc) call probably screws up num_temproots when (control?) exceptions are thrown inside the callback.

[15:32] <nine> Aaah, it's so obvious!

[15:42] <nine> Created a pull request with the fix :)

[15:57] <jnthn> nine: Left a note on the PR; it's not quite complete. Don't have time to address that right now, but will later on today if you don't beat me to it, and merge :)

[15:59] <nine> Note: I don't have a commit bit

[16:00] <nine> Oh, I should have thought about nativecall_libffi.c, especially since it was the first file I looked at and was confused because it was not even compiled ;)

[16:03] <nine> Pushed another commit with the ported fix

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: fc63808 | niner++ | src/core/nativecall_dyncall.c:

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix temp root stack underflow with exceptions in NC callbacks

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: MVM_gc_root_temp_mark marks the temporary root stack at its current height as

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: the limit for removing all roots. At this point all MVMROOTs have to be in

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: place. Otherwise a MVM_gc_root_temp_pop_all called by

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free_va will remove not only the temp roots installed

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: by the nested run loop, but also frame roots leading to a possible temp root

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: underflow later on.

[17:24] <dalek> MoarVM: Port the fix from commit fc63808c9d to nativecall_libffi.c

[17:25] <jnthn> nine: Thanks! :) In the event you have a golfed test case, feel free to add to Rakudo's nativecall callback tests...

[17:39] <JimmyZ> jnthn: any objectiont to my pr?

[18:15] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Didn't review it yet, but in principle it's a good idea :)
