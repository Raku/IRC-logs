[11:23] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[11:24] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[11:25] <brrt> \o jnthn

[11:25] <brrt> this morning I took my old DS on the commute

[11:25] <brrt> it was quite less fun than anticipated

[11:26] <jnthn> Oh?

[11:29] <ilmari> DS? Citroën, Nintendo, something else?

[11:29] * jnthn was assuming Nintendo... :)

[11:38] * nwc10 hopes Nintendo, as a Citroën *DS* is quite hard to figure out a food refernece for (unlike anH)

[11:38] <nwc10> whereas this seems to be a gift: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fast-Food-Panic-Nintendo-DS/dp/B002DY9KGQ

[11:40] <jnthn> Ah...yes, it's lunch time :)

[11:40] <jnthn> write /dev/stdout: no space left on device

[11:40] <jnthn> o.O ...yeah, certainly lunch time

[11:41] <moritz> might happen when it's redirected to a file, no?

[11:41] <moritz> anyway, guten Hunger! :-)

[11:47] <timotimo> brrt: then you've taken the wrong games ;)

[11:48] <timotimo> or maybe the realization that the resolution is incredibly low and the performance is really limited and all that ...

[11:48] <brrt> yes, nintendo

[11:48] <brrt> well, i've played them all before, i guess :-)

[11:49] <timotimo> you don't have a flashcart that you can put all games onto? :)

[11:49] <brrt> towards nintendo i'm amazingly unpirately

[11:49] <brrt> so, no

[11:49] <timotimo> OK

[11:50] <timotimo> may i ask what games you brought?

[11:50] <brrt> yes… i had fire emblem

[11:51] <brrt> and, metroid fusion and metroid zero mission, and legend of zelda, and, advance wars

[11:51] <brrt> so in fact, most games were GBA games

[11:51] <timotimo> ah, i see

[11:51] <timotimo> i like these two metroid games a whole lot :)

[11:51] <brrt> yes, i do too

[11:52] <brrt> but i didn't feel like starting all over, and i had no idea were I was in the saved games

[11:52] <brrt> and in general, it was not a good place to focus on high-intensity action games

[11:52] <timotimo> oh, right

[11:53] <timotimo> probably also not the right place to play, for example, Rhythm Heaven

[12:02] <brrt> i have no idea what that is

[12:03] <timotimo> it's fantastic, is what it is :)

[12:03] <brrt> i see

[12:03] <timotimo> well, i'm into rhythm games anyway, so i'm clearly biased

[12:06] <timotimo> on the DS, rhythm heaven has you hold down and flick your stylus on the screen in time with things happening on the other screen that are synchronized to a little music track

[12:15] * stmuk_ tried upgrading libuv to 1.9.1 in the hope the *BSD crash went away but it didn't

[12:20] <timotimo> we might want a libuv update anyway, though

[13:08] *** brrt joined
[14:18] *** brrt joined
[15:36] <timotimo> one of these days i really have to go through spesh and make sure all the opts we have leave the graph in a sane state

[15:37] <timotimo> and somehow figure out how to make inlined blocks go through fact discovery and optimization
