[19:10] <avuserow> I ran into a double free or memory corruption error on some code on moar yesterday. Is github issues an okay place for this? (Wanted to make sure that it wasn't a potential security bug that should be directed elsewhere)

[19:16] <jnthn> avuserow: The GitHub issues queue should be fine; thanks for asking.

[19:16] <jnthn> And thanks in advance for reporting :)

[19:28] <avuserow> jnthn: not a problem. let me know if you want me to run it under gdb or valgrind or anything like that. I'm attempting to golf it down a bit now.

[19:28] <jnthn> avuserow: Does it involve a multi-threaded program?

[19:30] <avuserow> no, I'm not using any constructs like that

[19:35] <jnthn> Hm, OK

[19:39] <jnthn> And golfing is very helpful/welcome. :)

[20:04] <avuserow> bug report filed. The golfed code only seems to fail on the initial revision, so I also attached ungolfed code which fails on a ~30 minute old rebuild.
