[13:52] <nwc10> jnthn: new (to me) ASAN barfage in t/spec/S32-io/IO-Socket-Async.t

[13:59] <dogbert17> nwc10++. nice find

[13:59] <timotimo> is there also a paste of the barfage?

[14:01] <nwc10> not yet

[14:04] <nwc10> http://paste.debian.net/900528/

[14:04] <timotimo> oh, asan isn't telling us where it was allocated and where it was freed?

[14:04] <timotimo> i believe valgrind is capable of that
