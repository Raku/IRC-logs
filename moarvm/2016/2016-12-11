[10:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Apple doesn't install binutils by itself, so when you install

[10:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: them via homebrew, they're named with a 'g' prefix, i.e.

[10:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 'gobjdump' rather than 'objdump'. I have no idea if this works

[10:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: for others, so I've added an --objdump option to override.

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Stop making trees at frame handler annotations

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: When we encounter a frame handler annotation, this usually requires

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: inserting a label, which may invalidate the basic-block property that

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: code is run without interruption. This patch plugs that hole and allows

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: rakudo CORE.setting to build again. However, this remains an ad-hoc

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: way of dealing with such annotations, seeing as from the perspective of

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: the JIT, theey are really basic block-level attributes rather than

[22:38] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: instruction-level attributes.
