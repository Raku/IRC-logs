[19:20] <nine> .tell brrt nice advent calendar post! Though I have to admit that I do not yet fully understand the tile syntax. There are many "reg"s and in the explanation I'm not sure to which ones you refer. Also "the expression" is quite ambiguous.

[19:20] <yoleaux2> nine: I'll pass your message to brrt.
