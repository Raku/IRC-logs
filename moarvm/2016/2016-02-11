[00:00] <flussence> for some reason the code it compiles there just emits nothing, trying to figure out why...

[00:05] <flussence> I'm at a complete loss; when I extract the C and the commands Configure.pl runs and do them manually it works fine

[00:06] <timotimo> wow, crap.

[00:06] <timotimo> how does it communicate that outwards? printf?

[00:08] <flussence> it's a printf("%u\n" thingy

[00:08] <timotimo> mhm

[00:08] <timotimo> you said when you run it manually it works, eh? o_O

[00:08] <flussence> this is failing in the middle of a gentoo ebuild, mind you

[00:08] <flussence> but still, this *used* to work

[00:08] <flussence> argh

[00:09] <flussence> I'm really struggling to figure out why it doesn't all of a sudden

[00:11] *** vendethiel joined
[00:11] <timotimo> it gets killed by a signal or something?

[00:13] <flussence> nope, the program just... doesn't print anything

[00:13] <timotimo> o_O

[00:13] <timotimo> so some #define not working out?

[00:15] * flussence installs gdb

[00:15] <flussence> let's see if I can remember how to use this thing...

[00:19] <flussence> and it's only doing it on one machine /o\

[00:20] <timotimo> oh lord

[00:24] <flussence> one out of three, that's fun. maybe I should just reboot it and see if that unscrews things...

[00:25] <timotimo> i hope thta machine still comes up :S

[00:25] <timotimo> sounds shaky

[00:35] <flussence> still no good, gah

[00:35] <flussence> ...doh

[00:35] <flussence> disabling distcc fixes it.

[00:36] <flussence> which doesn't make sense, cause I've got that on this other comp and it works fine there.

[00:44] <flussence> eh, whatever. nobody's going to hit it but weirdos like me :)

[00:49] <timotimo> we could just try it 4 times before giving up

[00:49] <timotimo> if we get the '' output, that is

[00:51] <flussence> wait a sec... why doesn't it just `use Config`?

[01:00] <flussence> m: use Inline::Perl5; say Inline::Perl5.new.run('use Config; $Config{ptrsize}'); # that specifically

[01:01] <flussence> aw nuts

[01:02] <flussence> but yeah, that oneliner is a biiiiiit simpler and more reliable than trying to reinvent the wheel :)

[13:30] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[13:31] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[13:31] <brrt> \o jnthn

[13:31] <brrt> long time little overlap in irc presence :-)

[13:31] <brrt> how are things

[13:33] <jnthn> Not too bad

[13:33] <jnthn> Energy levels and stuff slowly improving.

[13:34] <brrt> thats good to hear :-)

[13:34] <jnthn> Still not "recovered", though at least more motivated and back to enjoying working on stuff. Mostly $dayjob stuff of late. :-)

[13:35] <jnthn> Though plugged us some leaks in MoarVM :)

[13:36] <jnthn> And trying to untangle the Perl 6 versioning story...

[13:36] <brrt> i saw that. it looks complex

[13:37] <brrt> as in, a difficult job to do

[13:42] <jnthn> Yeah.

[13:42] <brrt> it basically means getting the whole community on a single line

[13:42] <brrt> maybe even reducing commit bits for rakudo

[13:42] <brrt> although that may not be necessary

[13:43] <brrt> given that there is always revert

[13:43] <jnthn> Well, you'll never get everyone to agree on these things, but so far I think I've just about managed to tread a course that hasn't caused a lot of strong disagreement.

[13:45] <jnthn> I'd be surprised if we'd have to resort to anything like taking away commit bits. As you say, there's revert, but more than that I trust the folks who have them. :)

[13:45] <brrt> i think your proposal is quite reasonable

[13:45] <brrt> hmmm... true

[13:45] <brrt> #perl6 is remarkably nonhierarchical

[13:46] <brrt> and pleasant, imho :-)

[13:47] <jnthn> Yes. In fact, even the repos with really liberal commit bit policies have seen nearly no issues.

[13:47] *** vendethiel joined
[13:47] <jnthn> (That arose from that policy)

[13:51] <jnthn> heh, that moment when you wonder why Visual Studio Code's autocomplete just busted randomly...then realize when you come back from grabbing a cuppa that you were doing the edits in Atom.

[14:07] *** cognominal joined
[14:14] *** zakharyas joined
[14:15] *** vendethiel joined
[14:29] * brrt actually never uses autocomplete

[14:29] * jnthn rarely does either

[14:30] <jnthn> I tried to write C# without it and then realized I didn't *know* the class libraries well, I just autocomplete my way to using them. :/

[14:31] <jnthn> Funny thing though. I did a couple of .Net certs once. Microsoft's naming schemes are consistent and predictable enough that I could just look at a name and be like "nah, they'd never call the method *that*" and pass the cert. :P

[14:32] <nwc10> that's an interesting failure mode for multiple choice tests

[14:32] <brrt> that is an extremely common failure mode for multiple choice tests

[14:32] <brrt> that is basically how i got my bachelors degree

[14:32] <brrt> :-P

[14:33] <nwc10> "which of these is not an Elbonian word?" ... "congratulations, you scored >80% and we will award you a certificate in Elbonian"

[14:34] * ilmari can't remember a single multiple-choice test during his bachelor's studies

[14:34] <ilmari> but that was a) in .no, and b) 10-15 years ago

[14:35] <ilmari> every time I think about how long ago uni was I feel old

[14:39] <geekosaur> (tell me about it... early 1980s)

[14:43] <jnthn> Yeah. Thankfully, I don't need to worry about doing certs any more. :)

[14:45] <jnthn> ...or university :P

[14:45] <jnthn> Though uni was at least fun :)

[14:51] <brrt> it can be
