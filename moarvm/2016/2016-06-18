[00:28] <jdv79> how come when i try to printf a MVMGrapheme32 with %lu or %ld i get the wrong values like -2 when i think it should be 211 or something.

[00:28] * jdv79 has no c skills

[00:29] <jdv79> but i tried the same thing in a small isolated example and it worked fine

[00:29] <timotimo> if it's negative, it's a synthetic

[00:30] <jdv79> ah.  oh yeah.  that makes more sense.  thanks.

[00:30] <timotimo> look for the "synthetic" functions to figure out how to translate it

[00:30] <jdv79> very nice

[00:30] <timotimo> feel free to ask me anything else, too :)

[00:30] <timotimo> i have written a gdb plugin in python before that allows you to print MVMString everywhere they appear. however, they don't handle synthetics yet, now that you remind me of it

[00:31] <geekosaur> also, 64 bit platform %ld will expect a 64 bit value, MVMGrapheme32 sounds 32 bit to me?

[00:31] <timotimo> that's right

[00:33] <geekosaur> and this matters for varargs functions like printf

[00:33] <geekosaur> whereas for fixed parameter functions C will upcast when needed

[00:35] <geekosaur> sizeof (int) == 4, sizeof (long) == 8 (x86_64 linux, at least. platform abi will also matter)

[00:39] <geekosaur> compiler inspects literal format strings for the purpose of warnings, but does not use them to guide code generation, so it's up to you to provide the right size value to go with the format spec

[01:54] <TimToady> maybe someone we trust the trust of someone who should write a decompiler for the nqp bootstrap, someone other than who we've already trusted the trust of in writing it :)

[01:55] <TimToady> perhaps we should not ask a governmental agency to do that, though...
