[07:29] <timotimo> we haven't had a libuv bump in about 8 months; maybe we'd benefit in some way if we went from 1.8 to whatever is current

[07:31] <nwc10> make with the spectests?

[07:36] <timotimo> make like a spectest and get the hell outta here?

[13:04] <timotimo> with avuserows code run under valgrind we get a few reads past the things inside a p6opaque repr that are num_classes-sized-allocated, but try_get_slot-indexed. we read exactly past the allocated memory segment, but we never appear to write there

[13:04] <timotimo> under valgrind it doesn't crash. it gives Type check failed in assignment to $!value; expected Buf but got Mu (Mu)  -  in method new at /tmp/lib/BinaryScanner.pm6 (BinaryScanner) line 60

[15:04] <brrt> nwc10: do you happen to know if your YAPC::EU talk was recorded

[15:05] <brrt> or, failing that, if the slides are online somewhere

[15:05] <brrt> i'd be interested to see it

[15:16] <nwc10> brrt: it was recorded. They estimate 7-10 days to get online

[15:16] <nwc10> the radio mike cut out several times, before they replaced the battery

[15:17] <nwc10> the lady on the camera says that the recording should be good

[15:17] <nwc10> I'm not trusting this :-)

[15:17] <nwc10> we plan to record the v1.1 version at Innsbruck on Saturday

[15:20] <moritz> don't fall prey to the Second Talk Syndrome :-)

[15:21] <nwc10> I have two more slides and at least one failed joke to edit out

[15:38] <jnthn> Somebody should do a talk comparing the talk you give with one you could have hypthetically given. :P

[16:07] <mst> oh, this is very cool: http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/03/02/nice-errors-in-lalrpop/

[16:07] <mst> bah, meant for -dev sorry
