[07:21] <brrt> JimmyZ: I'll take a look at it if you want

[07:25] <brrt> JimmyZ: a MVMCallSiteentry is typedef'd as MVMuint8

[07:25] <brrt> your patch is not wrong, but neither was the original code

[07:25] <dalek> MoarVM/missing_mvmroot: fix more missing MVMROOT

[07:25] <dalek> MoarVM/missing_mvmroot: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b05affdbc8

[07:27] <JimmyZ> brrt: see https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/21abc2a1132b9fb69734befcaf4835007d1dbf0d/src/core/frame.c#L1710

[07:27] <brrt> also, know what *is* wrong (or at least overly evil):

[07:28] <brrt> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/97d288c8242da0484f10358c125d55bc48f7b17c/src/core/args.c#L730

[07:28] <brrt> realloc with inline multiplication

[07:28] <brrt> and yes, I've been there and done it myself

[07:29] <brrt> I know JimmyZ, but itis also redundant there :-)

[07:29] <brrt> meh, not your fault, i would've made the same change :-)

[07:30] <JimmyZ> brrt: I cares about it because https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/412

[07:30] <JimmyZ> brrt: which segfaults in arg_flags

[07:31] <JimmyZ> brrt: though I don't know how to fix it yet

[07:31] <JimmyZ> :P

[07:53] <brrt> let's see

[07:53] <brrt> on the other hand, adding it is better than not, because we might decide to change the size of MVMCallsiteEntry at some poing

[08:35] <brrt> hmmm... i find that i'm not very much enthusiastic to fix the 'old' register allocator to work with the new tile structure...

[08:36] <brrt> but, better to do it so that the change is minimal

[13:40] <dogbert17> hmm, no spectest fails with 128k nursery and lots of debug flags, damn looks like I'm out of a job :-)

[13:41] <jnthn> Time for 64k! ;)

[13:42] <jnthn> There's also still an issue with a 10KB or smaller nursery in socket-recv-vs-read.t or whatever it's called

[13:44] <dogbert17> ok then, 64k it is

[13:50] <brrt> it ought to be enough for anyone

[13:52] <jnthn> dogbert17: Oh, if you're looking for bug hunting to do: the docs build was also crashing over fromspace access when I accidentally left some of the debugging checks enabled in the normal build

[13:52] <jnthn> They are no longer, and it only failed sometimes, and it may be that one of yesterday's fixes nailed it

[13:53] <jnthn> But could be worth trying it out to see if it tickles anything

[13:55] *** stmuk_ joined
[14:02] <dogbert17> jnthn: will look at that as well

[15:47] <dogbert17> running make spectest with a small nursery is sloooow

[15:54] <jnthn> Ain't it just...especially with all the extra sanity checks on :)

[15:55] <dogbert17> I'm at S03-* now, only one fail so fair t/spec/S03-metaops/hyper.rakudo.moar

[17:20] <dogbert17> jnthn: does the following gist contain anything that might be useful? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/44f312acd7a13445e4a2a2c7757110c5

[17:21] <jnthn> dogbert17: Somewhat, yes :)

[17:22] *** domidumont joined
[17:22] <dogbert17> when I increased the nursery to 128k everything worked

[17:25] <dogbert17> should I report it or is there a way to get more information?

[17:26] *** lizmat joined
[17:26] <jnthn> Well, it's a tad tricky from here

[17:27] <jnthn> The next step I'd take is to grab a dump of the bytecode

[17:27] <jnthn> And then try and figure out where in it we are

[17:27] <jnthn> The interp.c line number (not check_reg, the frame below) points to the instruction we were executing at the time

[17:27] <jnthn> You might also try with an even smaller nursery to try and get a different/more informative trigger

[17:28] <dogbert17> jnthn: you mean this MVM_interp_run (tc=0x804c450, initial_invoke=0xb7dc902a <toplevel_initial_invoke>, invoke_data=0x80a3cc8) at src/core/interp.c:5260

[17:29] * dogbert17 I ran it in gdb again so some numbers might have changed

[17:31] <dogbert17> 5259             OP(sp_getarg_s):

[17:31] <dogbert17> 5260                 GET_REG(cur_op, 0).s = tc->cur_frame->params.args[GET_UI16(cur_op, 2)].s;

[17:31] <dogbert17> 5261                 cur_op += 4;

[17:31] <dogbert17> 5262                 goto NEXT;

[17:38] <jnthn> Hm, interesting indeed

[17:38] <jnthn> That'll need further digging :)

[17:39] <jnthn> Since somehow the args buffer is outdated

[17:39] <jnthn> I'm away for a bit for dinner and stuff; feel free to file it with this info :)

[17:54] <dogbert17> done, issue 456
