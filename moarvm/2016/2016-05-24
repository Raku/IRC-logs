[12:21] <pmurias> jnthn: when do we increase the serialization format version?

[12:24] <jnthn> pmurias: When making any change that would render a version of MoarVM that doesn't know about a change unable to successfully/completely deserialize things

[12:33] <pmurias> jnthn: thank you, had a disagreement about my "Serialize hll role" pull request

[12:35] <jnthn> pmurias: Yeah, keep meaning to review that :)

[12:35] <pmurias> I just found an empty else in it :(

[12:38] <pmurias> (fixed that)

[16:33] <hoelzro> a MoarVM frame may or may not be a callable, right? it could just be something like an if $cond { ... } block?

[16:44] <hoelzro> I suppose my question is - is there a way to tell if a frame is the top level frame of a method vs an arbitrary lexical frame?

[19:12] <jnthn> hoelzro: Not in MoarVM

[19:12] <jnthn> But Moar shouldn't really care

[19:12] <jnthn> At QAST level, the blocktype is immediate for things like if $cond { ... }

[19:14] <hoelzro> ah ha

[19:14] <hoelzro> jnthn: I'm just digging into that "nextsame looking for $*DISPATCHER in its caller" behavior I saw

[19:14] <hoelzro> wondering if p6finddispatcher should stop crawling up the frame stack once it hits the sub boundary

[19:16] <jnthn> Hm. Or maybe we just need to install a $*DISPATCHER in all routines that "blocks" the other one

[19:17] <hoelzro> ah, that could work too

[19:17] <hoelzro> at first blush, that doesn't sound terribly performant, but I'm guessing it's ok if you suggested it =)

[19:17] <jnthn> It's just about free

[19:17] <jnthn> Since all lexicals are lazily vivified :)

[19:18] * hoelzro has much to learn

[19:18] <jnthn> I forget exactly the details around this stuff :)

[19:18] <jnthn> (Haven't had to touch it for a long while...)
