[18:31] <diakopte1> jnthn: the commit descriptions there look promising

[18:35] <nine> *** Error in `/home/nine/rakudo/install/bin/moar': munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer: 0x00000000040ccc30 ***

[18:35] <nine> Steps to reproduce: mkdir $(perl -E 'print "\xf0"') && cd $(perl -E 'print "\xf0"') && perl6 -e 'dd $*CWD'

[18:37] <timotimo> can you try to narrow it down to a buf being .decoded with utf8-c8?

[18:38] <nine> timotimo: can you reproduce on MoarVM master? If not, forget it. I might just be out of date.

[18:39] <timotimo> let's see here ...

[18:39] <timotimo> "/tmp/􏿽xF0\0".IO(:SPEC(IO::Spec::Unix),:CWD("/tmp/􏿽xF0\0"))

[18:40] <nine> Ok, then sorry for the noise :)

[18:40] <timotimo> no problem :)

[18:40] <nwc10> ASAN is happy

[18:40] * nine is looking forward to running plain unmodified rakudo again...

[18:40] <timotimo> if you want to fix something about utf8-c8, you can look at the end of the thing where we can end up reading past the input buffer if the input is sufficiently crafty

[19:41] * diakopter guesses once that branch is done, it'll see an nice overall speedup :p
