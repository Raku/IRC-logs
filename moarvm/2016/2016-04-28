[08:41] <jnthn> nwc10: In the reframe branch, with JIT disabled, yes?

[08:41] <nwc10> yes and yes

[08:43] <jnthn> How about the hangy tests you mentioned?

[08:44] <nwc10> have not yet hung

[08:44] <nwc10> (IIRC)

[08:44] <nwc10> but I've also been testing master over the past few days, so I have to remember which branch I'm on to correlate hanginess
