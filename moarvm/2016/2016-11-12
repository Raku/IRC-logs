[19:48] * timotimo wonders what the API for an ndarray-view repr should look like

[19:48] <timotimo> and what kinds of cases it should support

[19:49] <timotimo> like, do we support transponation? do we support skipping lines in some dimension?

[19:49] *** pyrimidine joined
[19:50] <timotimo> i suppose slicing a single 1-width slice on any dimension is obvious

[19:50] <timotimo> how about cutting a rectangular region across some dimensions?

[19:51] <timotimo> i'd imagine if we had the same thing numpypy has, it'd be all you could want

[19:51] <timotimo> i seem to recall it has one triplet of values for every dimension the view has

[19:52] <timotimo> how much to increase the address by when you +1 along the dimension, how much to increase it by when you skip over the dimension, and ... something else?!

[20:04] *** ggoebel joined
[20:07] * timotimo is closing in on the code i'm looking for

[20:07] <timotimo> this triplet is named "strides"

[20:07] <timotimo> it also has a "backstrides" thing

[20:45] <timotimo> thinking more about it, clearly having one "stride" per dimension ought to be enough for common cases ...

[20:46] <timotimo> i'm not sure how reversing dimensions works

[20:50] <timotimo> like, traverse the items in backwards direction

[20:51] *** pyrimidine joined
[20:57] <timotimo> maybe by having an appropriate "start" point

[21:48] <yoleaux2> 11 Nov 2016 20:46Z <MasterDuke> FROGGS: sorry, another renaming thing, 'add_comp_files_to_directives' should be 'add_comp_lines_to_directives'

[21:52] <geekosaur> yay

[21:53] <FROGGS> needs two patches to moarvm though

[21:54] <FROGGS> nqp passes its tests, and rakudo segfaults very late in ./perl6-gdb-m tools/build/install-core-dist.pl /export/home/froggs/nqp/install/share/perl6

[21:56] <timotimo> ooh

[23:57] <timotimo> at first i thought i could overload set_dimensions to also handle strides, but that's dumb

[23:57] <timotimo> but strides is really a view-only thing, so i don't really want to expose that to everything that has positional functionality

[23:58] <timotimo> but it definitely doesn't fit into compose, because we're likely going to have different strides per object, just like we have different size-per-dimension values per object
