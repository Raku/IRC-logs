[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Simple fix for duplicated labels

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Tag nodes for labels in a single array, so we can prevent them

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: from being added twice. Also set flags in annotation reading code

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: to add dynamic controls once per instruction. And remove before_expr

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: since it is equal in all cases to before_ins.

[12:39] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ab21c188c9
