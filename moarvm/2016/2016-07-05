[07:58] <brrt> partially evil idea: two integers, one as a bitmap, one as the direct value of the lowest bit

[07:58] <brrt> .. scratch that

[07:59] <moritz> I love the smell of evil ideas in the morning!

[07:59] <brrt> :-P

[08:00] <brrt> evil ideas in the morning are just good ideas before one went to sleep and they started fermenting

[08:00] <brrt> well, the reason not to do that, is that i don't just need the set, i need the live range as well

[08:01] <brrt> i recall having a now totally broken up idea over a tree of live ranges

[08:01] <brrt> i'm not sure how that would work anymore

[08:13] <brrt> so, ultimately, i'm nothing better off than double-chain-linked lists

[08:13] <brrt> which isn't necessarily bad
