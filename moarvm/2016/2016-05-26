[09:13] <brrt> good *, ring-ding-ding-ding-ding

[09:14] <jnthn> banana phone!

[09:14] <jnthn> oh wait, wrong song :P

[09:20] <brrt> i'm not sure i'm that far along in the series :-)

[11:00] <brrt> hmm, i'm pondering agile-ness in relation to the JIT development

[11:01] <brrt> there are two observations here

[11:01] <jnthn> .oO( 0. We should continue not doing scrum :P )

[11:01] <brrt> a): i can't make progress unless i set small goals which are doable in at most, about 4 hours, because i don't have timeframes larger than that

[11:02] <brrt> b): i can't make progress unless these changes at each time yield something which works

[11:03] <brrt> c): i can't actually make such small changes and be sure to end up at the end, unless is analyze and design my trajectory upfront

[11:03] <brrt> or, rather

[11:03] <jnthn> I like how your observations were agile enough to grow an extra one :)

[11:03] <brrt> c): if i analyze my trajectory upfront, it becomes much more feasilbe to divide the work into pieces that satisfy a and b

[11:04] <jnthn> fwiw, I often - before digging into things - write myself a short list of steps in my text editor, that I work through

[11:04] <jnthn> If it's anything non-small

[11:04] <brrt> my 2 secret weapons are fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency...

[11:04] <brrt> well, that's design and analysis, isn't it?

[11:04] <brrt> i'm using org-mode for all of that these days, and i've been very happy about that

[11:05] <jnthn> Pretty much, yes :)

[11:05] <brrt> soooo... A and B are just about the agile manifesto repeated, C is almost the antithesis?

[11:06] <jnthn> I don't really think agile is "go wander off in some direction and hope it'll all be OK"

[11:06] <jnthn> Though I've seen it treated a bit like that

[11:06] <jnthn> But it's reacting to change *over* following a plan

[11:06] <jnthn> That doesn't mean "don't plan"

[11:07] <jnthn> It means don't follow a plan when the circumstances change

[11:07] <brrt> hmmm

[11:07] <jnthn> And render the plan possibly less valuable

[11:07] <brrt> that almost sounds like its just engineering

[11:07] <brrt> :-P

[11:07] <jnthn> Which does carry an implication of not making plans that are doomed to become invalid.

[11:08] <jnthn> But yeah, I've seen "let's do agile" lead to "we don't need to plan"

[11:08] <brrt> i have so many stories about that, that it wouldn't be at all a good idea to write about on a logged channel

[11:12] <brrt> interestingly, i think i have a plan for adding the requisite spill-load capacities, correctly even

[11:13] <brrt> it's just a long road :-o

[12:38] <nwc10> jnthn: I almost had a bootstrapping problem. I put the saucer onto the coffee machine, not the cup. Fortunately I realised before I pushed the button.

[12:39] <jnthn> Coffee flood narrowly averted!

[12:40] <nwc10> aye, but also "clearly coffee needed here as a pre-req for correctly making coffee"

[12:41] <jnthn> ...do you normally take a saucer to go with the cup? :)

[12:43] <nwc10> yes. some sort of obsession

[12:48] <jnthn> Curious. :)

[12:49] <jnthn> I mean, with tea it feels like a saucer is natural. But coffee...

[13:03] <nwc10> it's a (sort of) hemispherical cup shaped like a tea cup

[13:03] <nwc10> so it feels like it needs the saucer

[13:03] <nwc10> (as hemispherical as a tea cup is hemispherical)

[13:04] <jnthn> ah
