[08:59] <FROGGS> morning jnthn

[08:59] <jnthn> grmbl...persistent cold is persistent

[08:59] <FROGGS> jnthn: ne too now

[08:59] <FROGGS> me*

[09:00] <jnthn> Feels like nearly everyone I talk to has it :P

[09:00] <FROGGS> /o\

[09:00] <jnthn> Guess it's the time of year

[09:03] * lizmat only has a light sniff

[09:06] <jnthn> Mine has never got overly bad

[09:06] <jnthn> It just won't go away

[09:43] <jnthn> That clears up the immediate error when pre-comping OO::Monitors

[09:43] <jnthn> Unfortuantely, it just causes it to fail with a different error

[10:13] <jnthn> Odd... Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure '' (src/Perl6/World.nqp:2180)

[10:14] <jnthn> Which is the compiler thunk that's meant to be replaced by runtime

[10:14] <jnthn> Uh, by serialization time even

[10:18] <timotimo> hum, some reference not being marked and a gc moves it? :\

[10:18] <timotimo> probably a long shot

[10:18] <jnthn> Unlikely

[10:18] <jnthn> Doubt it's VM-level

[10:20] <timotimo> mhm

[10:27] <timotimo> we may be able to get our minimum memory use for perl6 -e '' down by a lot if we make the first pages in each fsa smaller

[10:29] <timotimo> like, we would do a quarter, a quarter, half, normal size

[10:30] <timotimo> also, i wonder if we should add one or two additional bits to the size mak above 256 bytes?

[10:33] <timotimo> huh, /me apparently totally wrong about the savings from making the first page smaller

[10:47] <timotimo> (to be fair, this also includes redzones, so we've got an additional 8 bytes per element in every size class

[10:53] <jnthn> lunch time...still debugging the OO::Monitors precomp fail, though got it golfed a good way

[10:55] <timotimo> good news

[11:13] <timotimo> hm, i think the latter hangs off of the former branch, but that's not necessary

[11:14] <timotimo> it's also interesting to put a printf at the beginning of deserialize_repr_data that outputs the debug_name of the thing we have

[11:27] <timotimo> i'm really not fond of the whole P6OMAX(something, 1) stuff we have there
