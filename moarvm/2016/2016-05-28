[03:04] <diakopter> jnthn++ # fixing my 10% build improvement to make it fixed

[03:05] <konobi> jnthn: you're one linux, right?

[03:05] <konobi> *on

[03:59] <diakopter> jnthn develops on Windows, and has a Linux VM

[10:44] <lizmat> jnthn: do you see comments on the gtk-simple repo ?

[10:45] <lizmat> https://github.com/vendethiel/moarvm-gcerr-gtk # repeatable GC error

[10:50] * timotimo isn't 100% sure .schedule-on + .tap is right; wouldn't it have to be .schedule-on + .start?

[10:52] *** edehont joined
[10:53] <lizmat> regardless of being wrong or right, there shouldn't be a GC error, no ?

[10:55] <timotimo> hm, i wonder

[10:56] <timotimo> it shouldn't, no

[11:58] <jnthn> .schedule-on + .tap means "run tha tap callback using the specified scheduler"

[11:58] <jnthn> So makes good sense in a UI program where that's exactly what you need: to run UI-updating handlers on the UI thread.

[11:58] <timotimo> OK

[11:59] <jnthn> That aspect of the code looks correct

[12:00] <jnthn> And yeah, getting a GC status error means something is very bust

[12:04] <jnthn> konobi: What diakopter said...though in the last week I did about 80% of my work inside my Linux VM. :)

[14:07] <diakopter> win10 + virtualbox latest + ubuntu 16.04 finally seems like a stable/free combination for me

[14:08] <diakopter> free as opposed to VMWare Workstation, I mean, though I guess I could just use VMWare Player also.

[23:29] <geekosaur> hey now, not everyone's modern linux is bleeding edge

[23:30] <geekosaur> (mint 17.3 is ubuntu 14.04 with updates. they'll get the next ubuntu lts in mint 18)

[23:31] <timotimo> wow, 2018, that's a long time to wait for a linux update :P

[23:31] <geekosaur> I did say "with updates"

[23:32] <geekosaur> that said, some people prefer their OS not to radically change every week or so
