[00:54] <timotimo> i don't actually see something that'll give me a proper number - statically at bytecode validation time, that is - that i can use to make sure param_* ops don't reference insane argument indices

[00:55] <timotimo> except maybe the checkarity code

[00:55] <timotimo> but i'm not sure if that's sufficient

[00:55] <timotimo> hm. at least after the checkarity call we can know that param_* on a number in that range will be satisfiable
