[08:12] <jnthn> konobi: On COW in GCs, I'm pretty sure I recall reading about an ML implementation that moved objects upon mutation, since mutation is rare in ML.

[08:25] <nwc10> jnthn: please consider spoiling the nice triangular numbers on http://act.yapc.eu/alpineperl2016/stats

[08:48] <brrt> hi #moarvm... turned out i also needed a pre-invokish for the extops, probably

[08:48] <brrt> let's check in how far that really works

[08:48] <brrt> (currently building CORE.setting... anxiety rises)

[08:48] <brrt> aaaaargh

[08:48] <brrt> no

[08:49] <brrt> :-(

[08:49] <brrt> that's not enough

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit: f78f1e8 | brrt++ | src/jit/graph.c:

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit: extops require a new pre-throwish too

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit:

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit: This doesn't actually solve any of the crashes. But is will

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit: certainly be necessary.

[08:55] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f78f1e8ee8

[09:03] <brrt> i have no idea where the CORE.setting crash is coming from :-(

[09:07] <brrt> well, i know it a bit... but i don't know why it happens

[21:17] <timotimo> yesterday i put in a few lines of code to put the "recalculate dominators" between the first and second pass. now we're crashing pretty hard inside the two-finger intersection, because a bb that only has succs, but no prevs (or something like that) has an uninitialized value that we're just taking as the index into the rpo and boom

[21:17] <timotimo> i need better debug output

[21:23] <jnthn> I think I tired to quickly do that once, and it didn't work out so well for me either :)

[21:23] <jnthn> Then other stuff was more pressing :)

[21:24] <timotimo> quite

[21:25] <timotimo> the cat is aggressively asking for cuddles

[21:26] <timotimo> the way cats tell you you are still wanted in their life is kind of nice
