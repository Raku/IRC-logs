[09:24] <rarara> Where can I find docs about the IO abstraction interface in MoarVM ?

[09:45] *** khagan_ joined
[09:49] *** kjs_ joined
[09:51] <jnthn> rarara: Best place to start reading is src/io/io.h

[09:52] <jnthn> rarara: Though we delegate to libuv for most stuff

[10:06] <rarara> jnthn: ok, but you don't just expose the libuv API. I am trying to cook a fix for this https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127423

[10:09] <rarara> I guess that the problem is that it does not recognize the fact that those are not files

[10:16] <rarara> MVM_io_syncstream_eof is the function which has to be called instead of MVM_eof , right?

[10:18] <rarara> altough I think (but this is just my own opinion) that do syscalls in non-obvious places (the seek in eof check) is wrong

[10:18] <jnthn> rarara: tbh, I was dubious about that too

[12:07] <AmsterdamJoe> Is Bart Wiegmans in the room? I missed your talk at fosdem yesterday because i got mugged and beat-up about 12hr before hand 1/2 block from the campus

[12:07] <nwc10> AmsterdamJoe: he's on IRC as "brrt" and not here currently

[12:07] <jnthn> AmsterdamJoe: Ouch, that sounds painful. And...yes, what nwc10 said. He's here quite often.

[12:08] <nwc10> and that sounds pretty shit - sorry to hear that (and that sounds a bit lame from me, but I'm not sure what better thing I can say)

[12:08] <jnthn> Indeed :(

[12:09] <AmsterdamJoe> thanks, ill ask brrt for the slides

[12:10] <AmsterdamJoe> it was just ouch, not really aaAAAHHHHGG! because there was not alot of blood from me but it hurtss
