[13:14] <mojca> I have troubles with the built-in libatomic_ops

[13:14] <mojca> 3rdparty/libatomic_ops/src/atomic_ops.h:376:5: error: Cannot implement AO_compare_and_swap_full on this architecture.

[13:14] <mojca> this happens on OS X 10.7 (and probably only there)

[13:14] <mojca> the released version of libatomic_ops works fine

[13:14] <mojca> and moarvm compiles just fine when libatomic_ops is installed system-wide

[13:15] <mojca> I also have troubles with libtommath, but there it's the opposite: the build fails when I have the system library installed

[14:13] <FROGGS> mojca: hmmm, we recently updated our internal libatomic_ops to the most recent version

[14:14] <FROGGS> mojca: that means the the releases version you are talking about might be an older, potentially patched version

[14:15] <mojca> FROGGS: I opened an upstream ticket: https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/issues/23

[14:15] <mojca> the problem is gone if I use a newer compiler

[14:15] <mojca> but that probably still means that their "if â€¦ else" is flawed somewhere

[14:15] <FROGGS> ahh, interesting information in the ticket...

[14:15] <FROGGS> yeah, most likely

[14:16] <mojca> but now I'm stuck with 10.6, arghhh

[14:16] <mojca> it builds out of the box when I'm not using any external libraries

[14:16] <mojca> and it's stuck when I try to add an external dynlib

[14:16] <mojca> it would also help if https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/321 was resolved

[14:17] <mojca> does anyone have a clue what exactly is going on here?

[14:17] <mojca> https://build.macports.org/builders/ports-10.6_i386_legacy-builder/builds/13099/steps/install-port/logs/stdio

[14:18] <mojca> Can't link simple C program.

[14:20] <mojca> I don't have access to 10.6/i386

[14:20] <mojca> Error: ld: library not found for -ldyncall_s

[15:37] <mojca> I need help with LDFLAGS

[15:37] <mojca> After some discussion we realized that LDFLAGS are not respected here:

[15:37] <mojca> https://build.macports.org/builders/ports-10.6_i386_legacy-builder/builds/13099/steps/install-port/logs/stdio

[15:38] <mojca> We have "LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -arch i386'"

[15:38] <mojca> but: Failing command: clang -o try try.o -ldyncall_s -ldyncallback_s -ldynload_s -latomic_ops -luv -lpthread 2>&1

[15:38] <mojca> without -L/opt/local/lib which is why the library isn't found

[15:38] <mojca> and totally crazy, it seems to work on 10.7: https://build.macports.org/builders/ports-10.7_x86_64_legacy-builder/builds/19278/steps/install-port/logs/stdio

[15:40] <[Coke]> not to be a buzzkill, but at some point we can say "we don't support 10.6", no?

[15:40] <mojca> yes, we could, but there's nonetheless something fishy in that code

[15:41] <mojca> the same version compiles just fine if I don't use external libraries

[15:41] <mojca> if perl6 will need some special feature absent on 10.6 at some point, that's fine, we can drop it

[15:42] <mojca> but at the moment it seems to be something completely weird

[15:42] <mojca> and something fixable

[15:52] <mojca> actually this seems to be a problem also on 10.11 and 10.7 where two of us tested

[15:52] <mojca> env LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib /opt/local/bin/perl Configure.pl --prefix=/opt/local --has-dyncall

[15:52] <mojca> trying to compile a simple C program ............... ERROR

[15:52] <mojca> Can't link simple C program.

[15:52] <mojca> Failing command: clang -o try try.o -ldyncall_s -ldyncallback_s -ldynload_s -lpthread 2>&1

[15:52] <mojca> Error: ld: library not found for -ldyncall_s
