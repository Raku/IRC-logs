[08:46] <brrt> good *

[08:47] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[08:47] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[08:48] <brrt> it's suddenly so sunny in here

[08:49] <brrt> i can hardly see my screen

[09:58] <jnthn> Oh no. Summer is coming. /o\

[10:02] <nwc10> ban pollen!

[10:06] * FROGGS .oO( Ja, die schlimmen Polen! )

[10:07] <tadzik> >:O

[10:07] <FROGGS> *g*

[10:10] <moritz> Polnische Pollen?

[10:11] <FROGGS> probably

[10:12] <FROGGS> I'm quite near Polen actually

[10:13] <jnthn> Depending on "quite near", I'm quite near Germany :)

[10:13] <nwc10> I could see Slovakia from the old flat, on a clear day

[10:13] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm not *that* near

[10:14] <nwc10> The best road signs round here have 6 countries on them.

[10:14] <jnthn> Bratislava is so close to Austria that I used to walk to Austria on a Sunday afternoon on nice weekends :)

[10:14] <jnthn> I'd then notice everything was closed, and head back :)

[10:14] <nwc10> could you actually spot the border? I think there's a field across it now on either side of the (new) A6

[10:15] <FROGGS> it is less than 100km to Poland from where I live

[10:15] <jnthn> nwc10: Very much so, because the (abandoned) customs post was still there

[10:15] <nwc10> distinct from "the border is now a field boundary" - there seems to be one field across it

[10:16] <jnthn> Wow. International farming :)

[10:16] <FROGGS> hehe

[10:17] <nwc10> "when I was a lad, this was the Iron Curtain"

[10:17] <nwc10> not that I ever came here when I was a lad.

[10:17] <FROGGS> I could also walk to Poland on a Sunday, it just takes 19 hours according to google maps

[10:18] <jnthn> That'd mean getting up before 5am on a Sunday. /o\

[10:18] <FROGGS> it is just a technical possibility :o)

[10:18] <nwc10> and you'd have lots of time for it to be a "good morning" without needing UGT

[10:19] <FROGGS> that's always the case with small kids

[10:19] <nwc10> although I'm pretty sure that if you have to get up at 5am, it's only a "good" morning if you're calculating that 5am using UGT

[10:19] <FROGGS> hehe

[10:20] <jnthn> 22.5 hours for me to walk to Germany

[10:20] <nwc10> ours are actually generally OK in the morning. The problems are (like 2 nights ago) when we ended up with one in our bed in the wee small hours of the morning

[10:20] <FROGGS> a good Coffee could be a workaround though

[10:20] <FROGGS> our smallest is still in our bed :o/

[10:22] <nwc10> the closest bit of Slovakia I can "find" on google maps seems to be 8h3min walk, but does have a ferry

[10:22] <nwc10> which appears to be about 3km of cheating

[10:23] <nwc10> 9h12 for landlubbers

[10:23] <FROGGS> damn, now I want to take a walk :S

[10:24] <moritz> how long does 3km swimming take? :-)

[10:25] <nwc10> well

[10:25] <nwc10> good part: it's downstream, so less

[10:25] <nwc10> bad part: this is the Danube we're talking about

[10:25] <nwc10> so there might not be an end time.

[10:28] * moritz not a good swimmer

[10:29] <jnthn> Pretty sure that river is not for da n00b...

[19:36] <timotimo> gdb looks into a specific ELF section for a python script to use with that program

[19:36] <timotimo> that's really cool

[19:39] <nwc10> oooh, so can you pwn someone's machine as root, if they are foolish enough to debug your untrusted binary?

[19:40] <timotimo> the default of gdb is to refuse to load scripts

[19:50] <timotimo> Loading of inlined scripts requires a properly configured auto-load safe-path (see Auto-loading safe path). The path to specify in auto-load safe-path is the path of the file containing the .debug_gdb_scripts section.

[19:54] <timotimo> https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/dotdebug_005fgdb_005fscripts-section.html -  the code to include that py code in there is *ugly*. but of course that'd be generated rather than typed

[19:54] <timotimo> isn't there an easier way to put some new section into an object file? :\

[20:14] <moritz> like a hex editor? :-)

[20:16] <geekosaur> objcopy can do it but I'm not sure it counts as easier

[20:32] <timotimo> as long as it can be put into the makefile ... :)
