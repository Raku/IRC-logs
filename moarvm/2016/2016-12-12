[09:51] <nwc10> \o

[09:53] <jnthn> Mondays. I took a mug out of the cupboard. Then somehow thought "no wait, I want coffee not tea", went to put the mug back in the cupboard...then it suddenly hit me that coffee also needs a mug. :P

[09:54] <nwc10> mug of expresso, it seems

[10:17] <brrt> i intend to start on the tile-template-pointer-removal-refactor this week, but i'm dreading it a bit

[10:18] <jnthn> Is it one of those "have to fix everything before it will build/run again" jobs?

[10:30] <brrt> yeah....

[10:30] <brrt> and at the same time 'it would be good if I also fixed $x, $y, and $z at the same time, now that I'm breaking it'

[10:31] <brrt> which further adds to the dread

[10:32] <timotimo> if you fix $x, $y, and $z, you can't move any more :(

[10:35] <brrt> well, all of them together are enough

[10:39] <moritz> if you x, y and z, you can still move in t :-)

[10:40] <brrt> true enough
