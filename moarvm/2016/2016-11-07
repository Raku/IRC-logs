[14:02] <brrt> to add to japhb and timotimo's answers: we don't use luajit per se, we use a piece of code that was developed together with luajit but has no 'system' relation to luajit

[14:02] <brrt> we use one of the tools that luajit also uses

[14:03] <brrt> and if you went the way of the LLVM, you'd first want to make sure that LLVM can actually generate good code, which means you have to (re)structure your VM/interpreter to simplify structure accesses

[14:03] <brrt> which is the *actual* difficult bit of having a high-performance VM

[14:04] <brrt> especially when you'd wish to combine that with 'portable'

[14:04] *** domidumont joined
[14:05] <brrt> and once you are there, then in all probability, LLVM or whatever backend will provide benefit in the order of percentages compared to what you could hack together yourself

[14:05] <brrt> so the interesting metric is, I think, 'system-complexity versus performance-gain-on-naive'

[14:06] <brrt> case in point: CPython want to minimize the system complexity part, and PyPy guys want to maximize the performance part

[14:17] <brrt> I guess we'd be in the middle of that

[14:20] <brrt> neither afraid of complexity nor racing headlong into it

[15:36] <nebuchadnezzar> hello

[15:36] <yoleaux2> 31 Oct 2016 10:23Z <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: Is there anything else I can do for you? otherwise I'd leave it in this state: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/9c06ac23b493be80e305d7aa1687a43c

[15:36] <yoleaux2> 6 Nov 2016 20:40Z <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: can we somehow put /usr/share/perl6/site/bin in PATH?

[15:36] <yoleaux2> 6 Nov 2016 21:45Z <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: forget what I said :o)

[15:45] <FROGGS> mst / nine: thanks again for the help yesterday evening

[15:45] *** hoelzro joined
[15:45] <mst> FROGGS: did you get a resolution?

[15:45] <FROGGS> mst: I was able to prove that that bug does not exist anymore

[15:45] <mst> awesome

[15:45] <FROGGS> (on a debian testing system)

[16:43] <brrt> damnit kids.... I had a whole bit about killing tile->template and I find I haven't even shaved that yak yet

[16:46] <japhb> brrt: Please shave all the yaks.  kthxbye.

[16:46] <japhb> ;-)

[16:47] <brrt> hehehe

[16:47] <brrt> so much to do, so little time...

[16:47] <brrt> at least I've implemented the heapifying logic

[17:19] <japhb> .tell brrt No fair asking me questions via PM and then going offline.  Ah well, ping me when you're back online again.

[17:19] <yoleaux2> japhb: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[19:16] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: hi, is there a reason that some bugs in moarvm/nqp/rakudo do not get closed, even though they are resolved?

[20:24] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: they are close only when a new package enter unstable with a changelog containing Closes #<bugID>

[20:25] <FROGGS> ahh, so one cant close them just now?

[20:25] <FROGGS> sad

[20:28] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: they can be manully set to pending if the fixes are in repository waiting for new packge

[20:29] <FROGGS> I see

[20:29] <FROGGS> well, then we have to wait for a new package to contain said Changelog lines
