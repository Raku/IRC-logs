[11:06] <domidumont> FROGGS: is this test done with 2016.10 ?

[11:06] <yoleaux2> 09:05Z <FROGGS> domidumont: here is the status of my debian VMs, I'll update it continuously: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/9c06ac23b493be80e305d7aa1687a43c

[11:08] <FROGGS> domidumont: moarvm, nqp and rakudo HEAD

[11:08] <FROGGS> so it is past 2016.10

[11:09] <domidumont> ok. Then I will disable powerpc arch when preparing Debian package. This way, testing will get updated versions (testing is still stuck at 2016.06).

[11:09] <FROGGS> domidumont: good idea... in the meantime I'll fix powerpc

[11:10] <domidumont> Yes, I'll add them back once you've found the issue

[11:10] <FROGGS> awesome

[11:56] <nebuchadnezzar> thanks guys

[11:56] <yoleaux2> 24 Oct 2016 05:45Z <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: MoarVM builds fine on mips64el, but is rather unusable it seems: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/05195d5426cbda9882a9dd00f684de72

[11:57] <yoleaux2> 25 Oct 2016 21:16Z <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: nqp and rakudo pass their tests on mips64el, it just takes ages to build and test

[11:57] <nebuchadnezzar> just for information, weather is very nice in Barcelona ;-)

[11:58] <jnthn> :P

[11:58] <jnthn> 'tis actually fairly nice here in Prague today also :)

[11:58] <jnthn> Sunny

[11:58] <jnthn> Though probably a bit cooler than in Barcelona. ;)

[11:59] <nebuchadnezzar> local people have sweetshirt, some have a coat, I'm in T-Shirt and tongs :-D

[12:07] <FROGGS> :D

[12:08] <FROGGS> I've got a cold, laying in bed and watching star trek...

[12:08] <jnthn> heh, was like that for me when I spent a winter in the south of Spain :)

[12:08] <FROGGS> so, could be worse

[13:30] <[Coke]> was 2ÂºC on the drive in today in upstate NY.

[13:40] <FROGGS> btw, the test failures on powerpc (big endian) seem to be libffi bugs

[13:49] <FROGGS> domidumont: do you know of a way to clone debian's libffi? https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libffi

[13:49] <FROGGS> domidumont: there is no VCS link :/

[14:01] <FROGGS> domidumont: for your reference: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/issues/286

[14:26] *** sivoais joined
[14:43] <domidumont> FROGGS: Sorry, I don't know. You can either contact the maintainer or download source package with 'apt-get source libffi6'

[14:43] <FROGGS> ahh, source, forgot about that :o)

[14:43] <FROGGS> thanks

[14:44] <domidumont> you're welcome

[15:09] <timotimo> am i right in assuming that whenever we know the size of a piece of memory by some external means, we should prefer the fsa over malloc?

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM: 45d5c13 | FROGGS++ | src/core/nativecall_libffi.c:

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM: use ffi_arg type for libffi nativecall return types

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM:

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM: This fixes issues on big endian machines, and is according to

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/issues/286 the right way to handle

[15:58] <dalek> MoarVM: it anyway.
