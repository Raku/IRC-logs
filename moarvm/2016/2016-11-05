[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime: 07d053f | FROGGS++ | src/platform/posix/time.c:

[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime: work around clock_gettime issue on OSX

[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime:

[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime: This hopefully resolves issue #437. Needs testing on pre- and post

[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime: OSX 10.12 / Xcode 8.

[10:37] <dalek> MoarVM/mach-clock_gettime: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/07d053f005

[10:38] <FROGGS> lizmat: can you please test that branch? (see https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/437 )

[10:39] <lizmat> FROGGS: I'm still on 10.10,

[10:39] <lizmat> does that make sense then ?

[10:39] <FROGGS> lizmat: it does

[10:39] <lizmat> I only need to build MoarVM, right ?

[10:40] <FROGGS> because the patch affects all osx versions, and I'd like to not break older boxes

[10:40] <FROGGS> lizmat: make install in MoarVM, and then spectest or so

[10:43] <lizmat> argh, it's been a while since I did not use the genned MoarVM/nqp

[10:47] <FROGGS> well, just chdir into MoarVM, and change branch and make install?

[10:47] <FROGGS> that should work IMO

[10:47] <FROGGS> if these bloody osx boxes wouldnt that expensive I'd own an older box...

[10:47] <FROGGS> wouldnt be*

[10:48] <lizmat> FROGGS: make install worked fine

[10:48] <FROGGS> well, that's something :o)

[10:48] <FROGGS> perl6 -e 'say time' # might already be enough as a test

[10:48] <lizmat> but seriously, how do I then use this MoarVM with my dev rakudo?

[10:49] <lizmat> --with-moar doesn't seem to be a valid parameter anymore, even though that's in INSTALL.txt ?

[10:49] <FROGGS> lizmat: it will be used if you'd just invoke perl6

[10:50] <lizmat> if you say so

[10:51] <lizmat> LizyPro:rakudo.moar liz$ ./perl6 --version

[10:51] <lizmat> This is Rakudo version 2016.10-171-g2ef2fdb built on MoarVM version 2016.10-37-gf769569

[10:51] <lizmat> implementing Perl 6.c.

[10:51] <FROGGS> yes, the git version is only picked up when you reconfigure

[10:51] <FROGGS> and we dont need that

[10:52] <FROGGS> make install in MoarVM replaces the moar executable, and that's the one that is used when running perl6

[10:52] <lizmat> so, let me recap:

[10:52] <FROGGS> (since perl6 is just a shell script)

[10:52] <lizmat> I'm in the rakudo dir, I do chdir nqp/MoarVM

[10:52] <lizmat> then git pull and git checkout yourbranch

[10:53] <lizmat> then do make install in there ?

[10:53] <FROGGS> $ ls -l $(which moar)

[10:53] <FROGGS> -rwxr-xr-x 1 froggs froggs 257680 Nov  5 11:53 /home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/bin/moar

[10:53] <FROGGS> lizmat: correct

[10:53] <FROGGS> $ cat $(which perl6)

[10:53] <FROGGS> #!/bin/sh

[10:53] <FROGGS> exec /home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/bin/moar  --execname="$0" --libpath="/home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/share/nqp/lib" --libpath="/home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/share/perl6/lib" --libpath="/home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/share/perl6/runtime" /home/froggs/dev/nqp/install/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm "$@"

[10:54] <lizmat> ok, rerunning this now

[10:54] <FROGGS> so the replaced moar exe will be used

[10:55] <lizmat> $ perl6 'say "foo"'

[10:55] <lizmat> Unhandled exception: add container config needs concrete string

[10:55] <lizmat> at gen/moar/m-main.nqp:10  (/Users/liz/Github/rakudo.moar/install/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm:<mainline>)

[10:55] <lizmat> actually, perl6 --version gives the same

[10:57] <FROGGS> what the heck

[10:57] <lizmat> going back in there, checking out the MOAR_REVISION, then doing make install, restores the status

[10:58] <FROGGS> okay, so far so weird...

[10:58] <lizmat> next week I should be able to give you 10.12 info, when my new iMac arrives

[11:01] * FROGGS tries to build HEAD of everything

[11:03] * FROGGS watches https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/builds/173477026 in the meantime

[11:05] <FROGGS> $ perl6 -v

[11:05] <FROGGS> This is Rakudo version 2016.10-176-gaa97f86 built on MoarVM version 2016.10-40-g68a18b4

[11:06] <FROGGS> lizmat: HEAD of rakudo+nqp and my branch works

[11:07] <FROGGS> now I'll try my branch + NQP_REVISION + rakudo HEAD

[11:10] <FROGGS> $ perl6 -e 'say time'

[11:10] <FROGGS> 1478344238

[11:10] <FROGGS> ~/dev/nqp$ perl6 --version

[11:10] <FROGGS> This is Rakudo version 2016.10-176-gaa97f86 built on MoarVM version 2016.10-40-g68a18b4

[11:10] <FROGGS> so that works too

[11:11] <FROGGS> lizmat: can you try my moarvm branch again after you've upgraded to rakudo HEAD?

[11:18] *** domidumont joined
[11:21] <lizmat> FROGGS: I'm always on rakudo HEAD

[11:22] <lizmat> ;-)

[11:23] <lizmat> so retrying your branch doesn't make sense, as it already was on HEAD that generated the error

[11:54] <jnthn> The container config error is usually a sign of the extops in Rakudo needing a rebuild

[11:54] <jnthn> (so just make clean and make in Rakudo should sort it)

[12:25] *** dogbert17_ joined
[13:19] <FROGGS> ahh, okay, that's why it worked for me...

[13:19] <FROGGS> I usually reconfigure every time

[13:52] <FROGGS> :o(

[13:52] <FROGGS> https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/jobs/173477037#L394

[13:52] <FROGGS> so, not perfect yet
