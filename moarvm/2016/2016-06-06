[06:10] <nwc10> timotimo: I get that. "@moarshared@" is expanding to ""

[06:11] <nwc10> instead of zero characters

[06:11] <nwc10> and gcc doesn't like that empty argument

[06:11] <nwc10> I don't know what the fix is, because I don't know where/when/why @moarshared@ is useful

[06:11] <nwc10> and the main coffee machine at work is broken

[06:12] <nwc10> so productivity today make take a hit

[08:05] <jnthn> nwc10: The main one? So there's backups? :)

[08:06] <nwc10> I think only backup singular

[08:06] <nwc10> the other one in the store cupboard appears to have been cleaned up and removed

[08:06] <nwc10> and the "backup" (the manual one that I usually use) seemed to be playing up about 5 minutes ago

[08:07] <nwc10> but yes, we're not yet shuffling around like zombies

[08:07] <nwc10> but there might be a queue for the working machine

[08:07] <nwc10> and a bunch of folks might need to learn how to use it

[11:43] <nwc10> I am pleased to report that the coffee machine engineer has finally been able to depart, and has explained proper TLC techniques to the admin staff

[11:43] <nwc10> (this is actually slow news on my part - he left about 1h45 ago)

[11:44] <jnthn> Oh, it wasn't cared for proper?

[11:45] <nwc10> it seems that the knowlege wasn't handed over from previous staff

[11:45] <nwc10> at least, not well enough

[12:22] <nine> If only writing had already been invented...

[12:23] <nwc10> I suspect that even "TFM" would help, if it could be found.

[13:10] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[13:10] <lizmat> jnthn brrt nwc10 o/

[13:11] * lizmat hopes for another blog post before tonight's P6W deadline

[13:12] <brrt> \o lizmat jnthn nwc10

[13:14] * brrt is going to try to split node and value descriptor live ranges

[13:21] <brrt> theres quite a bit involved in that if you indulge me

[13:23] <brrt> we currently create and assign value descriptors in the live range calculation step

[13:24] <brrt> assign them to tiles

[13:25] <brrt> and then in the second step i assign a register to each value descriptor (as they are created)

[13:27] <brrt> however, what i want is to calculate just the live ranges and then create a value descriptor as we assign the register

[13:29] <brrt> finally, although not completely necessary, i'd like to get rid of tbe stack of 'active' value descriptors

[13:30] <brrt> and replace them with an array/heap of end ranges per registet

[13:31] <brrt> since the number of registers we have is small and fixed, a heap may be overkill

[13:39] <[Coke]> Sorry, I hit commit and walked away.

[13:40] <[Coke]> is it complaining for anyone else, or just travis?

[13:40] <nwc10> me and travis. by "me", CentOS old-ish

[13:40] <nwc10> (is there any other sort of CentOS?)

[13:41] <nwc10> it's only "my" machine, not my machine. I don't get to choose the distro.

[13:43] <timotimo> i can't build moar now either

[13:43] <timotimo> well, of course i can by reverting the commit, but when i decided to check it out locally it asploded

[13:43] <[Coke]> if it's just moarshared, I can move the "" logic into Configure.pl for that one, I think, to avoid the empty string.

[13:45] <nwc10> Without looking at the code (but with looking at too much work code) I hope that that means something like "we decide whether to use "" to wrap it more smartly at interpolation time" and not just "we start carrying around an escaped value internally"

[13:45] *** brrt joined
[13:45] <nwc10> (work code is crazy and has far to many wrong ideas about when stuff should be escaped/unescaped)

[13:45] <nwc10> however, really, please do whatever is easiest to make it work, and clear to a future maintainer

[13:45] <[Coke]> No, I was just going to slap something together to get the build passing. ah well.

[13:45] <nwc10> ah OK.

[13:46] <[Coke]> fixed.

[13:47] * brrt just heard two very, very, very loud bangs in the city

[13:47] <timotimo> uh oh

[13:48] * [Coke] hurls https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/374 instead.

[13:48] * [Coke] will try out any future updates on a branch instead.

[13:49] <brrt> yes, and followed by a siren

[13:49] <brrt> no news though

[13:49] <timotimo> very loud bangs, could always be car collisions. in this case maybe trucks rather than regular cars?

[13:51] <brrt> louder than that

[13:51] <brrt> and two of them

[13:52] <brrt> the news page was just updated

[13:52] <brrt> 'what was it'

[13:52] <brrt> journalism in 2016

[13:55] <brrt> it was, an airplane

[13:55] <timotimo> o_O

[13:55] <timotimo> how the hell did that happen

[13:55] <brrt> it was expected

[13:56] <brrt> and it was announced an hour ago

[13:56] <timotimo> "we're going to be exploding an airplane, so plug your ears please"

[13:56] <nine> sonic boom?

[13:56] <timotimo> ah, that could be

[13:56] <brrt> sonic boom, yes

[13:57] <nine> Was actually my instant first idea when I read two very loud bangs :) But I'm an aviation nerd ;)

[13:57] <brrt> folks were already assuming this was an earthquake

[13:57] <brrt> i was assuming gas explosion

[13:59] <brrt> oh well :-)

[14:00] <jnthn> nine: Is there being two of them significant/a clue in some way? :)

[14:00] <brrt> apparantly the front and the back of the airplane make different bangs each

[14:00] <jnthn> Ah :)

[14:01] <timotimo> that's interesting to know

[15:05] <[Coke]> that might do it.

[15:12] <[Coke]> wonder why travis doesn't report the failure as soon as it knows a build failed (rather than waiting for all configurations to finish)

[15:13] <timotimo> good question

[15:51] <[Coke]> there we go.

[15:52] <TimToady> one also notes that the booms usually come about a quarter second apart, which is longer than you'd expect taking the plane's length into account

[15:53] <[Coke]> create a PR from a branch that was already tested by travis... get another travis check. wtf.

[15:53] <TimToady> so either the second shock goes slower than the first, or it's from some phenomenon where the air meets up some place behind the plane

[15:53] <TimToady> I suppose one could look it up these days...

[15:54] <TimToady> (we used to get sonic booms regularly in CA when they were landing shuttles at Edwards)

[15:55] <TimToady> I suppose distance and altitide could also have an effect on timing

[15:55] * TimToady wonders how much the first shockwave heats the air...

[16:11] <brrt> hmm, that probably depends on the effective surface area and the speed of accleration

[16:12] <brrt> also, in this case, there were two of them

[16:12] <brrt> intercepting a passenger plane that had lost radio contact.. which has since been restored

[16:12] <TimToady> well, was just wondering how much of the slowdown of the 2nd shock was thermal

[16:13] <TimToady> one can scarcely blame them for going super for that...

[16:14] <TimToady> plus you don't have as much or ocean to do it over there than we do here in CA :)

[16:14] <TimToady> desert or ocean

[16:14] <TimToady> well, don't want to OT this too much in a working IRC channel...

[16:22] <jnthn> Hm, passenger planes losing radio contact for a while seems kinda commonish. There was a case here in .cz within the last month, and I'm pretty sure one in the UK in the last couple of months too...

[16:37] <brrt> well, defense panicked in .nl, at least this time

[16:37] <brrt> obviously i have no idea how serious it was

[16:38] <brrt> it was just amazingly loud

[16:44] <timotimo> yay

[16:45] <brrt> (wow, USA used 31.5% /less/ coal in march 2016 than in 2015 :-o)

[16:46] <timotimo> is that a comparison between march 2016 and 2015

[16:46] <timotimo> or is it a comparison between march 2016 and march 2015?

[16:48] <brrt> last of these

[16:48] <timotimo> OK :)

[16:48] <timotimo> saving 31.5% on a 12x increase isn't really saving much :D

[17:33] <TimToady> though I suspect it's always plural in common usage: monkey bars...

[17:33] <timotimo> do -TRAP and -SHINE already have a meaning? i must have missed those

[17:33] <TimToady> no, they're just suggested future ones

[17:34] <TimToady> I think GUTS maps to 'use nqp'

[17:35] <timotimo> right, i remember MONKEY-GUTS

[17:35] <TimToady> so that 'use MONKEY' also turns that on

[17:36] <timotimo> oh, i didn't know about MONKEY yet, either

[17:36] <TimToady> we don't advertise it heavily, in case it turns out to be a bad idea :)
