[17:29] <timotimo> darn.

[17:29] <timotimo> with the line based coverage turned on, some spec tests die like this:

[17:29] <timotimo> Spesh: failed to fix up inline 3

[17:30] <timotimo> had to turn the while condition of the "eliminate dead bbs" loops to "cur_bb && cur_bb->linear_next" instead of just "cur_bb->linear_next"

[18:14] <timotimo> ideally, a failed spesh would bring us out of spesh, not out of the whole program

[18:14] <timotimo> and it's kind of weird to get an exception thrown when spesh fails, because ... are you going to react to that? it could happen literally anywhere

[23:04] <brrt> timotimo: that is why we have MVM_oops

[23:05] <brrt> to die with a stack trace but beyond catchinf

[23:06] <brrt> also when spesh dies it might well be because either therw is a bug in its handling or because memory got corrupted

[23:07] <brrt> and in those cases dying quickly is I think preferable to corruption
