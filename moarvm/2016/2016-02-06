[12:43] <dalek> MoarVM: This reverts commit b6e0e2a3876d30d356d9d2d7d1ec5edbd689eb53. Turns

[12:43] <dalek> MoarVM: out this is too early, but the place I'd have expected to move this

[12:43] <dalek> MoarVM: to already *is* freeing handlers. So will need a litle more analysis.

[17:34] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:34] <dalek> MoarVM: That is, reading some of a file, then slurp-rest'ing the rest of it,

[17:34] <dalek> MoarVM: in Perl 6 terms.

[19:18] <jnthn> Guess I didn't look hard enough for others.
