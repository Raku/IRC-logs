[15:37] <brrt> yes. moarvm is kind of complicated

[15:38] <jnthn> Modern dynamic language VMs are kind of complicated

[15:41] <brrt> :-)

[15:41] <brrt> in a related note o noticed just this morning that i hadnt implemented binary conditionals yet

[15:42] <TimToady> actually, the modern ones were simple, it's the post-modern ones that swing back to the romantic end of the classic vs romantic spectrum :)

[15:44] <brrt> :-)

[15:44] <brrt> we're overloadibg modern

[15:44] <jnthn> Just like "new"

[15:45] <brrt> and i noticed that assigning nodes to an synthetic tile is a poor idea

[15:45] <geekosaur> "modern" is always a moving target

[15:45] <brrt> one sense is and the other isnt

[15:47] <brrt> because the register allocator dispatches on the tile

[15:47] <brrt> eh node of the tile
