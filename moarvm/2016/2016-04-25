[07:13] <brrt> the infiniloop in nqp building on reframe-jit is not so easy to repeat

[07:14] <brrt> ... let's try ASAN

[07:18] *** zakharyas joined
[07:23] <brrt> does the --asan option work on OS X?

[07:23] <brrt> clearly, it does not

[07:26] <brrt> fix is easy fortunately :-)

[07:51] *** lizmat joined
[07:59] <brrt> infiniloop does originate from something ASAN is catching

[15:13] <psch> tomboy64: okay, i took a look.  i'm neither particularly perl5 savvy nor familiar with the moarvm build process, though... :)

[15:14] <psch> jnthn: did you see tomboy64++'s patch for a pkg-config aware moarvm Configure.pl?

[15:15] *** leont_ joined
[15:19] <jnthn> psch: No

[15:19] <jnthn> Link?

[15:19] <psch> an hour ago

[15:19] <psch> 14:21 < tomboy64> psch: mind taking a look at that? https://bpaste.net/show/0337fa47a038

[15:20] <jnthn> oh, no wonder I didn't pay any attention, it was addressed to you ;)

[15:21] <psch> i just send tomboy64 here vOv

[15:21] <psch> *sent

[15:21] <psch> the day before yesterday, i think.. :)

[15:21] * jnthn doesn't really know much about pkg-config and prefers to pretend not to know anything about the build process :P

[15:22] <jnthn> On line 45,

[15:22] <jnthn> +            $config{cincludes} .= ' ' . "$result";

[15:22] <jnthn> Oh, includes, not flags

[15:23] <jnthn> Though the invocation of pkg-config is --cflags :)

[15:23] <tomboy64> the problem is, if you build against native libraries, Configure.pl doesn't get the includes for libffi right

[15:24] <tomboy64> except for libtommath, the proper way for that would be to run pkg-config

[15:24] <tomboy64> ExtUtils-PkgConfig would be a perl wrapper for that but i was told to use native pkg-config or a perl-core package

[15:24] * tomboy64 shrugs

[15:29] <jnthn> Only thing I'd really note is that if it detects pkg-config but then pkg-config doesn't know about the package in question, it'll blow up

[15:29] <jnthn> Whereas before it'd just carry on

[15:29] <tomboy64> no, it will continue silently

[15:29] <jnthn> I dunno if that means "it'd be doomed anyway so this is fail fast"

[15:29] <jnthn> Oh?

[15:30] <jnthn> +        my $result = `$config{pkgconfig} --cflags libuv`;

[15:30] <jnthn> We then test $? and die otherwise

[15:30] <tomboy64> there a check for $? before

[15:30] <jnthn> Does it come back with 0 if pkg-config doesn't know the package?

[15:30] <tomboy64> it comes back with a non-zero result

[15:30] <tomboy64> try it out ;)

[15:31] <tomboy64> pkg-config --cflags blablubb

[15:31] <tomboy64> echo $?

[15:32] <jnthn> Right, so

[15:32] <jnthn> +    if ($config{pkgconfig_works}) {

[15:32] <jnthn> +        my $result = `$config{pkgconfig} --cflags libuv`;

[15:32] <jnthn> +        if ( $? == 0 ) {

[15:32] <jnthn> And later

[15:32] <tomboy64> https://bpaste.net/show/72fc34c83e53 <--- i made a little change here, forgot to upload that

[15:32] <jnthn> oh, it's a print, not a die

[15:32] <jnthn> d'oh

[15:32] <jnthn> OK, no problem. I just can't read, apparently :)

[15:32] <tomboy64> :)

[15:32] <tomboy64> it first checks if pkgconfig works in general

[15:33] <tomboy64> if pkgconfig works, check for the lib. if that's not there, use the original behavior.

[15:33] <jnthn> yeah, I got that part. I just wrongly thought that if it did work but didn't not he package, we bailed.

[15:33] <jnthn> But it just notes it and goes on

[15:33] <tomboy64> well, that would be an option ...

[15:33] <tomboy64> silent errors are rarely good :-}

[15:33] <jnthn> It would, but sounds less robust :)

[15:33] <jnthn> I think I like noting it

[15:33] <jnthn> As it does now

[15:34] <tomboy64> only problem left is, tommath doesn't register .pc files

[15:34] <tomboy64> e.g. to pkg-config it's invisible

[15:34] <tomboy64> (no idea why)

[15:37] <jnthn> OK. I'm fine with that patch going in

[15:38] <tomboy64> great :)

[15:38] <ilmari> tomboy64: because nobody submitted patches to them? ;-P

[15:40] <tomboy64> ilmari: mebbe :)

[15:48] <tomboy64> jnthn: psch: what about patches for nqp?

[15:49] <tomboy64> is this the right place?

[15:49] <psch> tomboy64: no, i think that would be #p6dev, ideally with a PR to http://github.com/perl6/nqp

[15:49] <tomboy64> psch: roger that

[15:51] <jnthn> tomboy64: If it's comfortable to PR that patch, please do so...otherwise I (or somebody else) can apply it manually later

[15:51] <jnthn> (Or just push it to a git remote somewhere is as good as the PR)

[15:51] <tomboy64> i can do a pr

[15:51] * jnthn bbl

[15:51] <jnthn> Thanks!

[15:51] <tomboy64> i will just need to make sure it actually works the way i intend it to
