[10:52] * lizmat used to live in a town with a Red Band factory

[10:53] <timotimo> was it noticable? :)

[10:53] <lizmat> lots of young women working there

[10:53] <lizmat> it was said that they had bad teeth  :-)

[10:54] <lizmat> not sure that was a bug or a feature

[10:54] <timotimo> huh, strange

[10:54] <timotimo> were they allowed to eat as much as they want off of the conveyor belts? :P

[10:55] <lizmat> not sure... I was in primary school at the time...  at one point, the factory moved to somewhere else

[10:56] <timotimo> maybe they didn't get dental plans from their employer?

[11:05] <lizmat> :-)

[11:05] <lizmat> probably
