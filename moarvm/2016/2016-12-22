[08:59] <lizmat> jnthn: is it a known issue that the Allocations tab in --profile doesn't show any information anymore ?

[09:27] * brrt thinks that the jit bisecter and jit comparifier are one of the best investments i've made in the jit

[10:03] <brrt> for instance, now I know that i broke WHEN, although it's not obvious why

[13:52] <brrt> should lldb that...

[13:52] <brrt> lldb, fwiw, is not as polished for command line use as gdb is

[13:55] <timotimo> probably not as bad as jdb

[16:58] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Macro definitions for register names

[16:58] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[16:58] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: This will allow us to use shorthand register names in the tiler (like

[16:58] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: rax, rcx) which will be expanded to fully-qualified identifiers on

[16:59] <brrt> sorry dalek. that was 4 commits by the way, and MVMJitValue is now dead

[16:59] <brrt> this had become a long-standing goal, so, yay

[16:59] *** dalek joined
[17:00] <japhb> brrt: What is the fully qualified identifier that goes with 'rcx'?  I mean, I think of that as being a full register identifier by itself ....

[17:00] <brrt> next on the list: legitimise the 'pseudo' tile

[17:00] <brrt> MVM_JIT_ARCH_X64_RCX

[17:00] <brrt> which is an enum for '1' :-)

[17:00] <brrt> anyway, afk

[17:06] <japhb> Ah, gotcha, thanks brrt.
