[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: 151b7f7 | jnthn++ | src/spesh/graph. (2 files):

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: A better fix for leak on inlining handlers.

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: This one doesn't wrongly free handlers that came from another spesh

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: candidate, which was the cause of problems with the previous attempt

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: to fix this leak.

[17:32] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/151b7f7e95

[17:33] <jnthn> I valgrund the CORE.setting build this time :)

[17:35] <jnthn> Which of course took forever, especially as I did leak tracking.

[17:43] <dalek> MoarVM: b05f0e6 | jnthn++ | src/mast/driver.c:

[17:43] <dalek> MoarVM: Don't leak buffer when saving bytecode to file.

[17:43] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:43] <dalek> MoarVM: We'd exit very soon after this anyway, but good to keep a clean sheet.

[17:50] <dalek> MoarVM: 90648b3 | jnthn++ | src/6model/serialization.c:

[17:50] <dalek> MoarVM: Some missing cleanup in bounded serialization.

[17:50] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/90648b39c6

[17:50] <jnthn> Those were the biggest leaks in CORE.setting compilation

[17:56] <dalek> MoarVM: 81d7f3b | jnthn++ | src/6model/parametric.c:

[17:56] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix leak in type parameterization.

[18:06] <lizmat> jnthn: so it's time for a MoarVM / nqp bump ?

[18:08] <jnthn> Might be wise to do a build/spectest with the changes first

[18:08] <jnthn> But I think it should be pretty alright

[18:09] <lizmat> ok, I'll give it a try
