[15:10] <timotimo> jnthn: you know how we recently got param_sp and param_sn into the profiler's allocation logging thingie?

[15:11] <timotimo> jnthn: i'm looking at a profile where "pull-one" is allocating a million BOOTHashes, pretty much all of them from jitted code, but the spesh output doesn't show a param_sn at all

[15:11] <timotimo> i'm not sure what's going on there
