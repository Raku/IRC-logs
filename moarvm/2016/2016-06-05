[13:50] <dalek> MoarVM: make moar-gdb.py source-able, instead of only autoloadable

[13:50] <dalek> MoarVM:

[13:50] <dalek> MoarVM: when not autoloading, "current_objfile" has no meaning.

[14:07] <timotimo> gdb is annoying to work with sometimes

[14:07] <timotimo> set logging file /tmp/foobar.txt, break in MVM_frame_find_contextual_by_name, commands "print name"; c; end

[14:08] <timotimo> run it for a few minutes

[14:08] <timotimo> turns out, i forgot to "set logging on"

[14:08] <timotimo> fair enough. start over, run it.

[14:08] <timotimo> turns out "start" will clear out plugins, so the names were just pointer values

[14:09] <timotimo> there doesn't seem to be a simple way to make the big line about breakpoints being hit from the output so i could just have the results for names

[14:11] <timotimo> result: table flipped. the results would probably not have been terribly interesting anyway

[14:12] <timotimo> $*W shows up a bunch of times, $*ACTIONS, too. then a bunch of others.

[14:12] <timotimo> we wanted to have the ACTIONS linked to from ParseShared, didn't we? i wonder if that's still an interesting optimization right now

[14:38] <nine> timotimo: if you find gdb annoying try working with jdb for some time :)

[14:38] <timotimo> ugh

[14:39] <timotimo> jdb is probably just an afterthought

[14:39] <brrt> seconded

[14:39] <timotimo> "we should probably also let people who don't have an IDE debug their shit"

[14:44] <jnthn> printf for the win! :P

[14:45] <timotimo> what attracted me to the idea of using gdb is you don't have to rebuild, and you have sort of a repl-like experimentation setup for your stuff

[14:46] *** colomon joined
[14:47] <nine> jnthn: printf debugging is much more fun when the time between adding the printf and looking at the result is significantly < 10 minutes ;)

[14:48] <timotimo> ah, yeah

[14:48] <timotimo> well, on moarvm when you change a .c file you only need to rebuild that single file and re-link, plus the relatively quick install step

[14:52] <brrt> gdb is awesome

[14:53] <brrt> or at least the principle is

[14:53] <brrt> lldb is on the other hand clearly not meant for human use

[14:53] <timotimo> beh. and that's all people have on osx?

[14:58] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ba7f715d3b

[14:58] <brrt> no, you can use gdb, but you have to jump through hoops

[14:59] <timotimo> OK :(

[14:59] <brrt> well, fortunately, i don't have to deal with that anymore (in the recent future at least)

[15:02] <brrt> near future of course

[15:02] *** colomon joined
[15:02] <brrt> i'm watching too much doctor who

[15:02] <timotimo> :D

[15:03] <timotimo> standing with your back to the future?

[15:03] <jnthn> nine: Yes, very true...

[15:03] * jnthn does use gdb, the VS debugger, etc. also :)

[15:04] <jnthn> Though in terms of tooling, the valgrind suite is perhaps what I reach for most these days

[15:05] <brrt> :-)

[15:05] <brrt> i'm going to go and ehm, have dinner or something

[15:06] <jnthn> om nom :)

[15:06] * jnthn is feeling super lazy and will order dinner to home today :)

[15:06] <jnthn> Got some nice cooking planned for next week though :)

[15:07] <timotimo> the usual time/money trade-off ... :)

[15:07] * brrt is that lazy more often than he would like

[15:07] <brrt> aye, and energy

[15:07] <jnthn> Yeah, energy is my problem.

[15:07] <timotimo> right, makes sense

[15:07] <jnthn> Slept really well last night, better than for a while. And my body is doign the "oooh, rest is good, let's keep doing that" thing :)

[15:07] <jnthn> *doing

[15:07] <timotimo> i have friends who live right in my neighbourhood. they have cats, and we cook & eat dinner together almost every day now

[15:08] * jnthn parses the sentence the wrong way, and has a mental image of timotimo cooking together with a bunch of cats

[15:08] <timotimo> well, the cats surely try to "help" with the ingredients

[15:08] <jnthn> ;-)

[15:09] <timotimo> "oh, your meat isn't chewed up yet? let me help with that"

[15:09] <timotimo> "oops, it's gone"

[15:10] <jnthn> ;)
