[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Extract MVMJitExprValue out of MVMJitExprNodeInfo

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: A particular nodes' value may be stored in a multitude of

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: registers and stack locations (and vice versa). Hence we want

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: multiple value (descriptor0 structures per node. I first

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: extract the MVMJitExprValue structure out of the NodeInfo

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: structure. The NodeInfo structure is relevant in an earlier

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: phase, not really during register allocation. Value structures

[08:25] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: are now spesh-allocated.

[19:46] <timotimo> http://panda.moyix.net/~moyix/LAVA_Sapienza.pdf - only a few slides in, this already looks very interesting

[19:50] <timotimo> the kicker is where they tested two common open source bug finding tools and they only found 2% of the bugs they injected

[19:50] <timotimo> a fuzzer and a symbolic execution constraint solver type thingie
