[12:22] <brrt> patches coming up

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 6a6fcc0 | brrt++ | src/jit/ (5 files):

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Move expression tree walking code

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: May be useful in other contexts (such as optimization)

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6a6fcc0df5

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 9a6ca81 | brrt++ | src/jit/ (4 files):

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Reduce register allocator surface area

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: We will now need way to specify per-tile register requirements,

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: as tiles can no longer try and 'fix' their registers at runtime.

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: We don't actually seem to hit the NYI paths, though.

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: fcc270b | brrt++ | src/ (12 files):

[12:22] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Replace ExprValue with ValueDescrioptor

[12:24] <brrt> i should probably blog about that

[12:24] <brrt> the upshot is

[12:24] <brrt> we have now the valuedescriptor structure

[12:25] <brrt> instead of 'expression values'

[12:25] <brrt> since, as you may know, there may be more than one of those

[12:31] <timotimo> yeah

[12:33] <brrt> now i need to write the tools to manipulate these things

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 34da4f6 | brrt++ | src/ (4 files):

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Internalize RegisterAllocator structure

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: The register allocator only contains temporary structures, and as

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: such does not need to be 'public'.

[12:57] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/34da4f6324

[12:58] <brrt> in the last bit of refactors, before we really have to change the semantics of the program, i'm pondering to have tile emit functions just take a tile*

[12:59] <brrt> which, after all, already contains the buffers with the value descriptors and arguments

[12:59] <brrt> i'm quite amazed how far we can get by incremental changes
