[08:05] <FROGGS> interesting... nqp::fromnum_I seems to be buggy on x32

[08:21] <moritz> might very well be; i've only been able to test in on 62bit

[08:28] <FROGGS> the interesting bit is, so to say, that it works on i386, but not on x32

[10:31] <dalek> MoarVM: use set_uint64 in from_num, otherwise we overflow on x32, see #425

[11:50] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: thanks a lot

[11:59] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: I hope it helps :o)

[12:00] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: what's the status of rakudo in debian ooc? is it still in unstable or in testing? or even not there yet?

[12:38] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: 2016.06 was automatically migrated in testing https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rakudo

[12:38] <nebuchadnezzar> I hope we could do better now since you made many fixes

[12:43] <nebuchadnezzar> domidumont: I think we could integrate the feature/switch-to-libffi branch and backport the upstream fixes to see how it does for all architectures. We may found other issues fixable before 2016.10

[12:52] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: being able to fix more stuff would be awesome

[13:47] <timotimo> The first line of the "Description:" should not start with the package name. For example, the package foo should not have a description like this: "foo is a program that...".

[13:47] <timotimo> this is terrible! we have to fix it!

[13:47] <timotimo> :)

[14:31] <domidumont> nebuchadnezzar: agreed. We can't do worse than the actual situation where testing is stuck at 2016.06...

[14:31] <domidumont> nebuchadnezzar: BTW, rakudo is now building and testing fine on armhf

[14:49] <domidumont> nebuchadnezzar: I've pushed all armhf patches on Debian repo. I'll let you add the x32 ones.

[15:14] <nebuchadnezzar> ok

[15:16] <FROGGS> JimmyZ: why do you include math.h? are we using anything from it?

[15:17] <FROGGS> domidumont++, nebuchadnezzar++

[15:18] <FROGGS> JimmyZ: nvm, I didnt read the patch correctly

[16:47] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: is that 2016.09-2 then?

[16:48] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: how long does it take until I see something happen here? https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=rakudo
