[15:50] <nine_> I wonder if it would be possible to mark functions as gc_allocating or not and have the compiler help with deciding whether a MVM_ROOT is necessary

[15:50] <nine_> Like with const arguments

[16:58] <timotimo> there goes the dream of "the perl6 compiler just disappears from memory when it's not used any more"

[16:58] <timotimo> it's in the compiler registry, because of course it is

[16:58] <timotimo> that's what the registry is there for

[17:01] <timotimo> and since user code could at any point invoke nqp::getcomp on 'perl6', we're dooooooooomed

[17:03] <timotimo> i want a nqp::forgetcomp op that i can put into my memory-critical programs :P

[17:03] <timotimo> (actually, that'll mostly be interesting to figure out what other things hang on to the compiler when the user program is running)

[17:04] <timotimo> we probably have stuff in the call stack of the user program that'll hold on to the compiler because it's the "self"

[17:09] <nine_> timotimo: are you running out of hard problems to tackle? ;)

[17:20] <timotimo> no, it's just that i fail at the hard problems all the time

[17:20] <timotimo> and it's frustrating me a little bit

[17:22] <timotimo> i think i need a little something to re-fuel my enthusiasm

[17:28] <timotimo> gotta run catch a movie with friends

[17:29] <[Coke]> as long as it's Captain America, you can go. :)

[17:38] <nwc10> I liked this movie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHqLz9ni0Bo

[17:38] <nwc10> However, it's not very long, and the sound quality isn't perfect.

[17:38] <nwc10> :-)

[17:38] <nwc10> (also they were off centre)

[17:39] <ilmari> and one of the landing legs is slightly on fire

[17:42] <[Coke]> damn, that's amazing.

[17:44] <jnthn> Very nicely done.

[21:18] <diakopter> downloading on wifi to my mac at 110 Mb/s; that's fun

[21:31] <ilmari> diakopter: you must live in a rural area

[21:32] * ilmari has at least 30 wireless networks in range at the moment

[21:32] <ilmari> usually maxes out at 30Mb/s

[21:49] <timotimo> nwc10: lovely recording :)

[21:51] <timotimo> but yeah, it was in fact captain america

[22:03] <timotimo> i wonder if a "forget compiler" op that installs a closure to re-fetch & re-install the compiler object in case it is needed again

[22:03] <timotimo> would make sense

[22:09] <timotimo> this should probably wait for another time. but now that we have the heap explorer i could actually build a "theoretical lens" that'd let me see if something else holds the compiler tight

[22:12] <timotimo> or, alternatively, have a "find all incoming edges to an object" command
