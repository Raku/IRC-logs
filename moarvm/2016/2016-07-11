[18:18] <brrt> good news folks.. there may be a chance the moarvm jit is finished this year

[18:18] <brrt> pokemon go doesn't work on my phone :-P

[18:18] <timotimo> :D, but also :(

[18:19] <brrt> oh well

[18:19] <brrt> maybe it is for the best

[20:06] <lizmat> so, is MOARCONF still a thing ?

[20:14] <timotimo> *shrug*

[20:19] * lizmat is not sure how to read that

[20:24] <jnthn> Some day, it totally should be. It's still rather uncertain whether I'll be able to make the trip to APW this year, though... :/

[20:25] <brrt> lizmat: i agree with jnthn... and i'm having the same problem with time unfortunately

[20:26] <lizmat> ok, fair enough, I won't push it anymore then

[20:27] <brrt> it should totally be a thing in the somewhat further future, though :-)

[20:29] <jnthn> Yeah, the idea is good, just need it at a time that'll work better for various folks.
