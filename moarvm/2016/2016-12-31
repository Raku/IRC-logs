[00:04] <samcv> oh. that is not right

[00:50] <samcv> oh i guess you had grapheme cluster break extend already but not the other ones

[01:53] <samcv> jnthn, this will probably be faster once i'm done with this, though don't know it's probably pretty fast already. but more optimized

[01:53] <samcv> switches and things

[04:04] <samcv> can't seem to nail down Prepend though…

[04:05] <samcv> for some reason it's failing those tests (we were failing them before), but i tried using both grapheme cluster break == Extend or bool MVM_UNICODE_PROPERTY_PREPENDED_CONCATENATION_MARK

[04:06] <samcv> and i get the right property when i query those two in perl6

[04:07] <samcv> [Coke], or jnthn how can i get moarvm to print stuff to console. how do I debug this?

[04:07] <samcv> oh wait. i think

[04:07] <samcv> maybe NFG_QC isn't set

[04:07] <samcv> yeah it's not set :P

[04:08] <samcv> \o/ we're gonna pass 99% of the grapheme tests after that gets working

[04:09] <samcv> and all but the emoji ones where you have to compare 3 characters, so will work in most cases and count the correct number

[04:11] <samcv> exciting

[04:12] *** pyrimidine joined
[04:16] <samcv> err wait no yeah, nfg-qc was set to no already

[06:56] <samcv> jnthn, PR :) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/476
