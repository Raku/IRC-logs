[10:21] <jnthn> Heh...seems the JIT missing the new write barriers seems to be to blame for the SEGVs.

[10:22] <jnthn> Won't be the only reason, but nqp's make test passes with JIT disabled :)

[10:36] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe: Add new write barrier to bindlex JIT.

[10:36] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/352293c4d4

[10:37] <jnthn> Odd, some tests now explode in the debugger and under make test, but run to completion if run directly...

[10:39] <jnthn> Oh, interesting. The JIT caches FRAME in a register but that can move if they're GC-able

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe: 1268c1b | jnthn++ | src/jit/emit_x64.dasc:

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe: Fix a typo.

[10:40] <dalek> MoarVM/reframe: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/1268c1b3b4

[10:56] <masak> meaning, the cache can hold the old address too long?

[10:56] <jnthn> Aye

[10:56] <jnthn> And it looks a tad tricky to fix

[10:56] * jnthn wonders if brrt might show up at some point today :)

[10:57] * masak wonders if there's a Java framework that purports to solve cache invalidation :)

[10:57] <jnthn> Probably not for the case where the cache is *a CPU register*!

[11:00] <masak> :P

[11:00] <jnthn> This is just one of those refactors that ends up breaking something that's been widely used as an invariant.

[11:01] <jnthn> So it needs changes in quite a lot of places.

[11:18] <nwc10> (still)

[11:18] <nwc10> AFK - POETS

[11:34] <jnthn> :)

[11:53] <masak> is nwc10 going to meet some poets, or is he going to recite some poetry with poets, or is he being chased by poets?

[11:56] <jnthn> It's an acronym ;)

[11:57] * masak .oO( Poets On Every Third Syllable )

[12:02] <timotimo> i thought it'd be about very loud poetry

[12:03] <timotimo> is the frame forced to be in one of the callee-saved registers?

[12:04] <timotimo> because if it's a caller-saved register, we'd already know exactly where we have to restore it, and we could just restore it from - i guess - tc->current_frame or whats-it-called each time

[16:04] * TimToady notes that 'lion' and 'poet' are both four-letter words, but then again, so are 'four' and 'word'

[16:05] <timotimo> letter ought to be a one-letter-word :(

[16:05] <timotimo> then again, 'letter' eq 'letter' x 1

[16:05] <timotimo> so i suppose letter *is* a one-'letter'-word

[16:06] <TimToady> sophists, the lot of you :)

[16:08] <timotimo> i think i actually might be an asophist
