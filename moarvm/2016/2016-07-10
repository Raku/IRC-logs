[08:12] <nine> WRT development methodologies: scrum style meetings instead of design and on the spot decomposition works quite well for low tech user facing code where the hardest part usually is finding out what the user actually needs.

[08:13] <nine> Waterfall type development falls down hard on those but works much better for technically difficult challenges where you really have to think a lot before starting to code.

[09:50] <stmuk> I've not seen scrum work particularly well for maintaining legacy code either

[09:51] <stmuk> new websites work better

[10:40] <brrt> nine: i agree... it's just that, imho, 'working well for technically non-challenging projects' is a very low bar to meet for a /technical/ project method

[10:47] <brrt> ... wtf

[10:47] <brrt> i've been having nothing but problem with all sorts of apps on fedora lately

[10:47] <brrt> *problems

[10:47] <brrt> turns out, my session is accidentally on wayland rather than X

[10:48] <brrt> focus changes, qt apps, etc, all of these broken

[10:48] <brrt> mother of ...

[10:48] <brrt> now i change it back to X, and *everything works again*

[10:53] <arnsholt> =D

[10:54] <brrt> it's less funny from this end

[10:54] <brrt> :-P

[10:54] <brrt> i've been *so* frustrated

[11:00] <arnsholt> I can imagine!

[11:01] <arnsholt> I've had some X troubles in general, but that's been due to my weird WM (XMonad) not that kind of shenanigans

[12:09] <nine> Oh technically non-challenging can still mean challenging :) And probably most software development projects fall into that category

[12:10] <nine> brrt: also I actually see itbas a good sign that it took you a while to notice that you're on Wayland :)

[12:56] <brrt> nine: that is also true (about nontechnical challenges)
