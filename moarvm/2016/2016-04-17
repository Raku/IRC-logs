[23:07] <dalek> MoarVM: cheaper access to ref counts if only 1 thread exists.

[23:07] <dalek> MoarVM:

[23:07] <dalek> MoarVM: MVM_frame_acquire_ref also ought to be enhanced like this

[23:07] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ca20e3c7c0

[23:08] <timotimo> oh no, what did i do?

[23:08] <timotimo> oh shit. no!

[23:08] <psch> quick, rewrite history! *scnr*

[23:09] <timotimo> maximum d'oh

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM: 38b55f0 | timotimo++ | src/core/nativecall.c:

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM: utilize debug_name in nativecall error messages

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM:

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM: we'll later want to improve this for cases where the

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM: debug name isn't set, so that it won't show as "()"

[23:09] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/38b55f0c6b

[23:09] <timotimo> i did in fact just rewrite history

[23:10] <timotimo> sorry about the noise

[23:10] <timotimo> i hope i was quick enough about it

[23:10] <psch> i have a feeling that wasn't the first time it happened

[23:10] <psch> not sure it was timotimo though the last time it did

[23:11] <timotimo> it was probably me

[23:20] *** travis-ci joined
[23:20] <travis-ci> MoarVM build errored. Timo Paulssen 'utilize debug_name in nativecall error messages

[23:20] <travis-ci> https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/builds/123784130 https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/cca2cbeb7a9d...2117aa7fa6d8

[23:20] *** travis-ci left
[23:24] <[Coke]> -1 on rewriting history. :|

[23:28] <psch> can i just say how i find it funny how travis joins, complains, and leaves

[23:29] <timotimo> [Coke]: it was only there for 2 minutes and 10 seconds

[23:29] <psch> ...i also don't disagree with the -1 on rewriting history, purely on a conceptual level though

[23:30] <timotimo> well, yeah

[23:30] <timotimo> there wasn't anything worth anything that got overwritten

[23:30] <timotimo> just mistaken merges from other branches

[23:30] <timotimo> and those look terrible in a graph of the history
