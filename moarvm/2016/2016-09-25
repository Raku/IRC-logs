[15:55] <nebuchadnezzar> domidumont: I saw your reply, I'm not sure if it's better to use libffi than dyncall on arm64, I would like to have the MoarVM team opinion on that

[15:57] <nebuchadnezzar> timotimo: you answered my question on dyncall/libffi last time, you may be the more appropriate on that topic?

[15:58] <timotimo> hmm, on arm64? i don't know much about that platform at all

[16:00] <timotimo> in general i think libffi and dyncall will both fully implement NativeCall, so it's up to you what to use?

[16:45] <nebuchadnezzar> thanks, we will stick to moarvm default choice for now, we may switch to libffi one day since it's packaged in Debian
