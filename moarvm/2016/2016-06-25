[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: 30a7932 | brrt++ | src/ (8 files):

[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: More things in their right place

[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: I can't implement loading spilled values just yet, because it

[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: requires sensitivity to the relative ordering of insert-after,

[08:40] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: and I'm not quite sure how to do that.

[08:46] <brrt> good *

[08:46] <brrt> currently testing the latest merge with master

[08:46] <brrt> and its clean

[08:47] <brrt> or at least it seems to be

[08:47] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 25 commits to MoarVM/even-moar-jit by bdw

[08:59] *** FROGGS joined
[09:13] <brrt> so the choice is:

[09:13] <brrt> a): built some as of yet unspecified mechanisms to ensure insert-before and insert-after relations

[09:14] <brrt> b): use consistent sort ordering to ensure that instructions are inserted in the order they are created

[09:15] <brrt> neither is really good, because I don't know how to do (a) efficiently, and i don't know if (b) is suffiicent

[19:16] <FROGGS> yeah, me has been too

[19:27] <nwc10> Is Germany as hot as Austria (and I guess also the Czech Republic with the very long name)

[19:39] *** japhb joined
[19:46] <FROGGS> I guess

[19:47] <FROGGS> at least, it is hotter than I prefer

[19:53] <geekosaur> 32 here, warmer tomorrow before dropping back

[20:06] <moritz> yesterday we had ~36C

[20:11] *** japhb joined
[20:13] <geekosaur> that's more like what we're expecting tomorrow

[20:14] <mst> it was kind enough to rain earlier

[20:18] <moritz> we had some rain tonight
