[00:00] <brrt> ping timotimo

[00:01] <brrt> yeah, that was naive

[00:23] <timotimo> pong brrt - what was naive?

[00:23] <timotimo> oh, probably the thing on #perl6 with yoleaux

[01:43] <orbus> nwc10: no worries.  I've been fiddling with the solaris build off and on for about 3 months

[01:43] <orbus> I'll see if I can get a stack trace with line numbers

[01:43] <orbus> you're right - may need to build with debug

[01:44] <orbus> I don't currently have gdb built... but it can't be harder than compiling gcc from scratch on solaris was :|

[02:29] <orbus> I may have jinxed myself - gdb build is not cooperating

[02:29] * orbus crosses fingers for second try

[02:48] *** ilbot3 joined
[03:24] <orbus> ok

[03:24] <orbus> success

[03:25] <orbus> nwc10: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/505835

[03:25] <orbus> have a look at that, whenever you have time

[03:25] <orbus> no big rush though - would just be nice to get it working at some point

[03:26] <orbus> I had to make some config changes, and a couple of minor code changes (mostly in upstream code) to even get it to compile at all

[03:26] <orbus> need to push those into github at some point

[03:27] <orbus> so figuring out the alignment stuff is not the only hurdle
