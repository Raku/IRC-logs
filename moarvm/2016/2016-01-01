[15:10] <dalek> MoarVM: also recognize callsites

[15:10] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/651a1b2cec

[15:19] <timotimo> so i'm wondering how a "heap explorer" would function

[15:19] <timotimo> it'd be easy enough to write something that walks the nursery and gen2 and collects a whole bunch of stats, that's for sure

[15:22] <timotimo> what would a user expect to do with such a tool?

[15:51] *** brrt joined
[15:59] <timotimo> hmm. the visualvm heap explorer lets you get a list of all instances for a given class, see all its fields and also find a "nearest GC root"

[16:32] *** zakharyas joined
[16:34] *** FROGGS joined
[16:57] <timotimo> i wonder if i should let users give an environment variable to choose the type of profile to generate and implement a memory profiler that gives more detailed statistics about allocations and GC runs, but doesn't do the call graph ... or something like that

[16:58] <timotimo> adding more details to the GC page would be kind of nice, but the profile json blobs are usually already too big in many cases

[17:33] <flussence> I'm looking at https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=moarvm -- most of them are long since fixed on this site, but 504720 isn't
