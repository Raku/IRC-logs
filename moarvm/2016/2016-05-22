[08:53] <pmurias> when do we increament the MoarVM serialization format version?

[08:54] <pmurias> * increment

[09:02] <JimmyZ> normally: see https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/cd5dfcff64ad89d969873f34b4b683f5f0574091

[09:03] <JimmyZ> pmurias: this one really https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6e9eef313f8974d897ab7dcd736ffd197765e859

[09:04] <JimmyZ> pmurias: it added codes like : if (reader->root.version >= 19)

[10:04] <pmurias> JimmyZ: I didn't add a check because I added a flag

[10:05] <pmurias> JimmyZ: if we are deserializing something serialized by version 19 the flag will be set to 0

[10:06] <pmurias> if version 20 serializes an object with a set hll role, and version 19 gets attempts to serialize it, version 19 will ignore the new flag it doesn't know about and things will fail with a weird error

[10:07] <pmurias> a hll role could be set before my commit, it was just not serialized
