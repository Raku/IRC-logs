[12:31] <brrt> quite possibly too much to ask, but can anybody recall why i wanted to put args with the tile

[12:31] <brrt> if not, i'll read the logs and figure out my thought process myself

[12:32] <timotimo> i can't recall :(

[12:32] <brrt> neither can i, but it was important, and it was a good solution, so i'm wondering for what problem

[12:33] <timotimo> mhm

[12:38] <brrt> here it is: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2015-12-16#i_11725785

[12:39] <brrt> the point is that we can make pseudotiles that take arguments; those arguments are not stuffed into the tree, hence, we need some other space

[12:39] <timotimo> ah

[12:39] <timotimo> pseudotiles is a thing i forgot about completely

[12:39] <brrt> we can therefore reuse the same space for both the pseudotiles and the regular tiles

[12:39] <timotimo> even though i argued for that solution at one point, iirc

[12:39] <brrt> i think you did yes

[14:39] <brrt> ohhai #moarvm. i've just found another complexity-balloon

[14:39] <brrt> in the jit

[14:40] <brrt> although, fortunately, it can be handled *after* tiler linearissation

[14:41] <brrt> i want to add offline register allocation, so i can do stuff like backpropagating to the desired register (e.g. when values have to live in RDI, RSI, RCX eetc because they'll be passed as C call arugments)

[14:41] <brrt> currently register locations are held in a per-node 'value' struct

[14:41] <brrt> however, the values computed in a node may change location as it is being moved about

[14:43] <brrt> so, if we attach the value struct to the tiles they are used in, they'll change underneath the tiles

[14:44] <brrt> so, they'll need to be copied

[14:44] <brrt> that makes things simpler again, but its yet another thing to take into account

[14:45] <brrt> it's funny how all these steps become individually simpler but the amount of steps increases  perhaps even faster

[14:50] <[Coke]> just did a git pull --rebase in moarvm and got:

[14:50] <[Coke]> Fetching submodule 3rdparty/libuv

[14:50] <[Coke]> fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/joyent/libuv.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com

[14:50] <[Coke]> ... and I didn't read the error message, nevermind.

[14:54] <brrt> what :-o

[14:54] <brrt> anyway, perl Configure.pl should do a git submodule sync and git submodule update

[14:54] <brrt> and that should get you the right url and checkout of libuv

[14:56] <geekosaur> ever used travis-ci? it fails builds because it can't pull from github all the time. no idea who's at fault where...

[14:59] <brrt> haven't, no

[15:00] <brrt> oh, great news, i've also just added a hash table and a linked list to the register allocator

[15:01] <timotimo> luckily we already have a library for hash tables in moar :)

[15:01] <brrt> true enough

[15:02] <brrt> but maybe a simple table is simpler to write by hand

[15:02] <brrt> i.e. i can do lots of simplifications because i know the purpose :-)

[15:04] <[Coke]> brrt: the problem is that I'm behind a firewall with crippled DNS, and I didn't configure my shell properly beforehand.

[15:08] <brrt> right, i didn't know that

[15:28] <brrt> fwiw, https://gist.github.com/bdw/33b977e07e7340f110b8 provides some hints on the tiler linearisation plan

[15:29] <brrt> (and by extension, on how the jit will proceed)

[15:32] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 57 commits to MoarVM/even-moar-jit by bdw

[15:52] <[Coke]> brrt: tilingare ?

[15:52] <[Coke]> oh. much more obvious in this font what that is.
