[01:42] <diakopter> timotimo: yeah, seems like those would be optimizations done by a decent compiler

[14:36] <diakopter> ahoy

[14:40] <jnthn> dobry den :)

[14:53] <diakopter> jnthn: any suggestions where to debug the precomp test?

[14:53] *** vendethiel joined
[14:53] <jnthn> diakopter: Beyond doing a debug, non-optimized build and attaching VS to the hung procs?

[14:56] <diakopter> hm, yeah

[15:02] <jnthn> The same but on another platform, hopefully to avoid the hosed stack trace?

[15:14] <diakopter> it seems fine on linux

[15:14] <diakopter> I could try --no-jit, but I don't know if the precomp thing passes it through to the subprocess

[15:21] <timotimo> i think it does copy over at least some arguments, like --stagestats i've seen show a bunch of results when something got precompiled, if i'm not mistaken
