[00:02] <yfkj> what are views?

[00:03] <yfkj> S09

[00:05] <timotimo> a view is simply an object that's indexable that refers to memory owned by another object

[00:05] <timotimo> in this case in order to have it indexed differently

[00:20] <yfkj> would views be faster than a transposition?

[00:21] <timotimo> depends on how often you access, i expect

[00:21] <timotimo> and if you access the thing completely?

[00:22] <timotimo> but we'll have to wait for jitting to be in place to see performance differences

[20:34] <FROGGS> w00t, nqp works aon aix!

[20:34] <FROGGS> on*

[20:35] <FROGGS> well, some test are failing, but still

[20:45] <[Coke]> FROGGS: nice. ... people still use AIX? (I remember when it was a new thing for my company back in '94)

[20:46] <[Coke]> (I know it sounds snarky, I'm genuinely curious ,though)

[20:47] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I don't know how big the user base is... but IBM released aix 7.2 in October 2015

[20:47] <FROGGS> so it is not dead yet

[20:47] <FROGGS> (or perhaps IBM does not want to hear that it is)

[20:47] <FROGGS> I really dunno

[20:47] <[Coke]> wow. nifty!

[20:48] <[Coke]> (for us back then, it was the replacement for Xenix)

[20:54] <stmuk> whens the SunOS 4 port coming? :)

[20:55] <[Coke]> someone was legit working on solaris recently, no?

[20:58] <FROGGS> rakudo works on solaris now, and I patched moar just a few days ago

[21:00] <FROGGS> gnight
