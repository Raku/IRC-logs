[14:51] <pmurias> is it possible to turn of gc in moarvm?

[14:51] <pmurias> (to debug a MoarVM bug)

[15:02] <timotimo> not really; what do you have in mind?

[15:02] <timotimo> in theory, you could set things to always be allocated in gen2 and that would never trigger a nursery collection and thus never collect gen2 either

[15:05] <pmurias> timotimo: I'm trying to figure out a bug which sometimes causes bits of javascript to be missing from nqp-js output

[15:06] <pmurias> timotimo: it seems to be happening in a what to appears to be a random manner so I don't really know how to reproduce it

[15:08] <timotimo> mhm

[15:08] <timotimo> i expect you've already thrown oun SPESH completely?

[15:09] <pmurias> no

[15:09] <timotimo> i'm not saying it will help, but it will at least make the surface area a bit smaller

[15:18] <pmurias> timotimo: will try when the bug appears again to harass me some more

[15:19] <timotimo> thanks

[15:19] <timotimo> i hope it helps :\

[15:19] <timotimo> but if it's truly gc related, turning spesh on/off can stir the pot sufficiently to make it go back into hiding again

[15:22] <pmurias> timotimo: finding a way to artificialy trigger seems to only sensible way to start hunting it down :/

[15:23] <timotimo> yeakh

[15:23] <timotimo> if you find something that makes it "go away", you can never know if you fixed it or just hid it so it can appear again later
