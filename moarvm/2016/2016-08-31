[15:19] <jnthn> Phew, 2 more ops :)

[15:22] <[Coke]> My Perl was bitten by a møøse once?

[15:52] <timotimo> the people responsible for the møøse biting have been sacked

[16:02] <timotimo> when this is finished, i might want to work on JSON::Tiny a bit to make it use that

[16:02] <timotimo> since JSON has a weird imagination of what valid input json should be

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: Implement basic byte-level decode buffer ops.

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream:

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: Used for when folks want to do crazy things like mixed text and binary

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: I/O (which we do handle already today, and so implement here so we'll

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: be able to use this in eventually brining sync I/O handling over to

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: using the VM-backed decoder API also).

[16:02] <timotimo> sorry, i meant JSON::Fast

[16:02] <dalek> MoarVM/expose-decode-stream: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3ac62322b3

[16:03] <timotimo> we should perhaps also make sure JSON::Tiny and the to_json portions of JSON::Fast don't emit things the JSON spec considers "invalid utf8" and emit surrogates

[23:32] <timotimo> i can get the crash from avuserow fixed by making sure the hint we get in getattr is in bounds.

[23:32] <timotimo> i'm not sure if we actually want a bounds check there.
