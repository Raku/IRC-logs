[18:59] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 20 commits to MoarVM/line_based_coverage_4 by timo

[18:59] <timotimo> ^- just a rebase of the line_based_coverage_3 branch

[18:59] <timotimo> not really merge-able as it interferes with inlining in some strange way :(

[20:12] <timotimo> Thread 3 bound to an attribute of an object allocated by thread 1

[20:12] <timotimo> at <unknown>:1  (/home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp/lib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP.moarvm:add_to_cache)

[20:12] <timotimo> i get a million cases of this when using a cross thread write log on a script that crashes with "zeroed target thread id in work pass"

[20:14] *** zakharyas joined
[20:19] <timotimo> i can make this go away by removing an autothreading operation from Promise.Bool

[20:20] <timotimo> i imagine we'll want to protect this cache with a lock perhaps?

[20:27] <timotimo> the crash i have now is in find_best_dispatchee

[20:27] *** lizmat joined
[20:27] <timotimo> well, not necessarily crash, but it shows up in the cross thread write log

[20:30] <jnthn> Cross thread write log doesn't mean bug

[20:30] <jnthn> Not automatically

[20:30] <timotimo> OK

[20:30] <timotimo> i'm not sure how to properly debug this program

[20:31] <timotimo> i wonder if it gets better if i throw out the native calls entirely

[20:31] <timotimo> cool, it still crashes. and very fast, too

[20:33] <timotimo> interested in the script?

[20:48] <timotimo> removing a sub that doesn't even get called makes it finish :D

[20:48] <timotimo> that sub is allowed to be empty and have an empty signature

[20:48] <timotimo> but it is also allowed to come near to the start rather than at the very end

[20:49] <TheLemonMan> JIT bug?

[20:49] <timotimo> /home/timo/perl6/install/lib/libmoar.so(MVM_args_proc_cleanup_for_cache+0x23)[0x7f6cabfda273]

[20:49] <timotimo> ^- this appears in a backtrace of something stumbling over a corrupted heap

[20:49] <timotimo> double free or corruption

[20:50] <timotimo> nope, i can get it to crash even when the jit is off

[20:50] <timotimo> and even when spesh is off completely

[20:51] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/610b39f340db90a4f14eab97c11fa2c3

[20:51] <timotimo> if you want to experiment

[20:53] <timotimo> mandelbrot is the sub that seems to make things stable when it gets removed

[21:06] <TheLemonMan> timotimo, jitbug :D

[21:06] <TheLemonMan> it's jumping to 0x3BB0

[21:09] <timotimo> how can it be a jitbug if it also explodes when the jit is turned off? :P

[21:09] <timotimo> must be one script with multiple bugs, i suppose

[21:18] <timotimo> keep me posted on what you find out, anyway

[21:19] <TheLemonMan> I finally managed to make it crash with the Jit turned off

[21:19] <TheLemonMan> MVM_SC_WB_OBJ: Assertion `!(obj->header.flags & MVM_CF_FORWARDER_VALID)'

[21:19] <TheLemonMan> no interesting output from valgrind though

[21:20] <timotimo> yeah, same on my end

[21:20] <timotimo> maybe ASAN has something to say, or maybe hellgrind
