[06:20] <brrt> ohai #moarvm. just realised, for further record, that you can't front-shift from a heap and expect it to remain a heap

[06:21] <brrt> which is interesting because it eliminates a potential shortcut

[14:49] <tbrowder> anyone awake?

[14:50] <[Coke]> not really

[14:50] <TimToady> need several more cups of coffee before that happens

[14:51] <tbrowder> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/IiXwODzd/

[14:52] <timotimo> tbrowder: that one's my fault. i can fix it, though

[14:52] <tbrowder> i know we have to support lots of compilers, but it seems it would be a good newbie task

[14:53] <tbrowder> thanks!  bye

[14:54] *** tbrowder left
[14:54] <timotimo> hm. i don't get that error actually

[14:55] <dalek> MoarVM: 56681b6 | timotimo++ | src/6model/reprs/P6opaque.c:

[14:55] <dalek> MoarVM: use PRId64 instead of %d for 64 bit int format string args

[14:55] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/56681b68d1

[15:37] <timotimo> hehe. -Wall -Wextra (not sure if one implies the other) gives a gajillion "unused parameter" warnings

[15:39] <timotimo> but -Wformat gives me the warnings tbrowder saw
