[01:07] <timotimo> my headache is limiting how well i can work here ... it took me *long* to notice i hadn't actually recompiled nqp after the patch to fix compunit pushing

[01:10] <diakopter> *comiserate*

[01:16] <timotimo> i don't know what that means :(

[01:53] <timotimo> when i'm feeling better i'll probably introduce graphviz support into the heapanalyzer

[02:02] <timotimo> why is graphviz.org down :\

[02:03] <timotimo> seems like connectivity in general is kind of b0rked from here right now :|

[02:04] <timotimo> google cache <3

[02:05] <timotimo> it doesn't seem like graphviz has anything in its -Tx11 that'd react to clicks on specific nodes :\

[02:06] <timotimo> otherwise it'd be totally feasible to use it as a front-end gui like thing and adding expand/collapse/path buttons to every node in the graph

[02:06] <timotimo> together with its "automatically refresh when the file changes" behavior

[02:13] *** colomon joined
[02:13] <geekosaur> I recall seeing that the unstable graphviz had a mode with more clickability... but the whole thing was still limited. Ended up not being my problem any more, and I think $coworker switched it to something else

[02:15] <timotimo> oh, huh

[03:05] <diakopter> did you look up comiserate :D

[06:55] <timotimo> yeah, it doesn't exist in my favorite dictionary

[06:56] <timotimo> it does find it once you add the second m to it

[06:56] <timotimo> and now that i see the translation, it's quite obvious that it means that, given its composition

[06:56] <timotimo> anyway, thanks :)

[17:36] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 130 commits to MoarVM/cache_sc_idx by diakopter

[19:03] <diakopter> aww, the cache_sc_idx branch only improves setting compile time by 7% now

[19:04] <diakopter> ISTR it was higher a bit ago

[19:12] <diakopter> does anyone get a clean rakudo spectest these days from moar master?

[19:25] <timotimo> hm, hat does perl6-roast-data say?

[19:25] <diakopter> dunno.

[19:25] <diakopter> but now (with strawberry toolchain), spectesting is hanging in S09-typed-arrays

[19:25] <diakopter> (and master branch)

[19:25] <diakopter> (not cache_sc_idx)

[19:26] <diakopter> anyone else build with strawberry?

[19:28] <timotimo> huh, in the typed arrays test?

[19:29] <diakopter> maybe this is interesting: all the stacks are hung in acquiring a spinlock in the kernel, called from MVM_gc_write_barrier_hit, called from MVM_crash_on_error

[19:30] *** vendethiel joined
[19:30] <diakopter> so I guess the spectest harness is having trouble detecting the hangs or killing them

[19:31] <diakopter> well I guess they wouldn't respond to signals if they're stuck in the kernel

[19:33] <timotimo> huh, it's supposed to crash, but it's trying to acquire some lock?

[19:33] <diakopter> yah

[19:35] <timotimo> that's definitely not so good :)

[19:35] <diakopter> whatevs, I'll just skip the strawberry toolchain and go directly to VS 2015 update 2

[19:40] <diakopter> after all, if it doesn't work in master, it's not really a supported platform, heh

[19:44] <diakopter> boy NQP really builds fast these days

[19:47] <timotimo> aye

[19:48] <timotimo> i get an almost clean spectest run

[19:48] <timotimo> t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.rakudo.moar  -  non-zero exit code

[19:48] <timotimo> t/spec/S32-num/power.rakudo.moar  -  passes a bunch of TODOs

[19:48] <diakopter> well I already abandoned strawberry entirely

[19:49] <diakopter> who cares about gcc on windows, anyway

[19:49] <diakopter> .seen lizmat

[19:53] <diakopter> rakudo-moar on Visual Studio builds 20% faster than on gcc anyway

[19:57] <diakopter> aaaaaaaand we're hung in S09-typed-arrays again

[19:58] <diakopter> weird

[19:59] <diakopter> maybe nqp needs rebootstrapped and hasn't been bumped?

[20:06] <diakopter> strange, entirely different toolchain and PATH, entirely different checkout

[20:06] * diakopter looks around for the JNTHN

[20:20] <timotimo> you only need to rebootstrap nqp if you're on the branch that does the rebootstrap for you

[20:20] <diakopter> oh

[20:20] <diakopter> well I'm surprised the S09-typed-arrays tests seem not to work on Windows at all

[20:20] <timotimo> that surprises me, too

[20:21] <diakopter> I mean, I guess it could've been a recent commit that wasn't spectested on windows

[20:21] <timotimo> could be, yeah, but jnthn does that all the time

[20:22] <diakopter> I mean recent like past couple days :D

[20:22] <diakopter> oh well

[20:32] *** kjs_ joined
[20:58] *** kjs_ joined
[22:40] <lizmat> diakopter: do you have a gist of where it hangs ?

[22:41] <lizmat> diakopter: there used to be a hang with .prepend: are you sure you're testing the latest ?

[22:44] *** mojca joined
[22:47] <diakopter> yes, tips of everything

[22:47] <diakopter> all I can see is the C stack trace there

[22:47] <lizmat> is there a specific one that fails, or do they all fail ?

[22:48] <diakopter> seems like all

[22:48] <diakopter> I'm thinking it's gotta be a commit in the past few days (since jnthn spectested on windows)

[22:49] <diakopter> since it fails the same way on both gcc/strawberry and msvc

[22:52] <lizmat> diakopter: I would be very surprised to see OS dependent behaviour in that part of the code

[22:52] <lizmat> it feels more to me that you're testing with an older rakudo, *with* the .prepend bug still in

[22:52] <lizmat> because I fixed that, and *then* added tests for it

[22:53] <diakopter> I did git clone

[22:53] <diakopter> fresh for both gcc and msvc

[22:53] <lizmat> make t/spec/S09-typed-arrays/*.t   # passes for me without any errors

[22:53] <lizmat> so I'm not sure how I can help with this...

[22:54] <lizmat> at least not without a gist

[22:54] <diakopter> what kind of gist

[22:55] <lizmat> perl6 t/spec/S09-typed-arrays/native-str.t

[22:55] <lizmat> for instance

[22:55] <lizmat> (assuming you've done a make install)

[22:57] <diakopter> invoking perl6 didn't work

[22:57] <diakopter> (can't find Test)

[22:57] <diakopter> oh FFS

[22:58] <lizmat> perl6 -Ilib t/spec/S09-typed-arrays/native-str.t

[22:58] <diakopter> the problem is the \r in my path

[22:58] <diakopter> ridiculous

[22:59] <timotimo> oh lord

[22:59] <diakopter> in the error for not finding Test

[22:59] <diakopter> three of the paths lost the first part (C:\Users\mwilson\src\v\r)

[22:59] <lizmat> I'm not sure I follow anymore

[22:59] <diakopter> they instead start with akudo\install\share\perl6

[23:00] <diakopter> somehow the \r is being interpolated

[23:00] <diakopter> and maybe the \v also?

[23:01] <diakopter> it says:

[23:01] <diakopter> Could not find Test in:

[23:01] <diakopter> C:\Users\mwilson\.perl6

[23:01] <lizmat> could you try: perl6 -Ilib t/spec/S09-typed-arrays/native-str.t

[23:01] <lizmat> ?

[23:01] <diakopter> akudo\install\...

[23:02] <lizmat> and maybe submit an error report about the error report being incorrect ?   :-)

[23:02] <diakopter> I did

[23:02] <diakopter> (just now when you suggested)

[23:02] <diakopter> it succeeded (all passed)

[23:02] <lizmat> *phew*  :-)

[23:02] <diakopter> I don't think the error report is incorrevct

[23:03] <lizmat> if it eats \r and \v's, it is, isn't it ?

[23:03] <diakopter> it was wrong in my Makefile too

[23:03] <diakopter> so it's brokener before the error message

[23:03] <diakopter> I had to add the \v and \r and remove a line break from two spots in the Makefile too

[23:03] <lizmat> it was my understanding that all moderner Windows understand / in paths

[23:04] <diakopter> only from scripts, not from shell

[23:04] <lizmat> isn't this from scripts ?

[23:04] <diakopter> well, it works from shell I guess

[23:04] <diakopter> but anyway, I didn't do anything special in Configure

[23:04] <diakopter> so Configure spat it out wrong

[23:04] <lizmat> so, my point being, why don't we just use forward slashes, even on Win ?

[23:05] <diakopter> well it already normalizes to something

[23:05] <diakopter> even if the user passes in paths with backslashes in configure options?

[23:07] * lizmat is tired after cycling 64km through hilly terrain

[23:07] <lizmat> so good night, #moarvm

[23:07] <diakopter> o/
