[01:03] <diakopter> hey, why can't an integer literal with pre- or post-decrement be invisbily transformed to (BEGIN my$=6)-- , as in: say 44 while 6--

[01:04] <diakopter> m: say 44 while (BEGIN my$=6)--

[04:26] <lizmat> diakopter: because phasers that run only once (like BEGIN and INIT) freeze their result

[04:26] <lizmat> m: say now - INIT now

[08:28] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[08:28] <brrt> ok, i've figured out a number of ways why the current iteration of inserting-spills doesn't work

[08:31] <brrt> a): the spilled values (which refer to locals) displace the register value descriptors

[08:34] <brrt> so we point the register to the local address, which is obviously out of range for the register indexes

[08:34] <brrt> b): we don't actually insert the 'load' code yet

[08:34] <brrt> then there is more stuff:

[08:35] <brrt> - the creation of a value descriptor, and assigning its (virtual) live range, are currently a single step, and they shouldn't be

[08:36] <jnthn> morning o/
