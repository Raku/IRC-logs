[08:26] <nebuchadnezzar> I don't know if someone is interested in some build warnings of MoarVM for 2016.07 (https://qa.debian.org/bls/packages/m/moarvm.html) ?

[11:15] <arnsholt> nebuchadnezzar: The dyncall ones are in budled 3rd party code, so probably won't be fixed (unless they're actually bugs)

[11:16] <arnsholt> The last one is in Moar code though

[11:26] * jnthn wonders if that last one is the pthreads_yield thing

[11:26] <jnthn> iirc the last attempt to fix that resulted in the current warning becoming a failure in various places, so tread carefully :)

[11:28] <nwc10> git blame for the the relevant lines usually helps

[11:34] <arnsholt> jnthn: Don't you mean... thread carefully?

[13:31] <brrt> hey #moarvm

[13:31] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[13:31] <brrt> just 2c: that warning comes from the fact that wherever _phtread_yield() is called _GNU_SOURCE must be defined and it isn't

[13:31] <brrt> the cheap fix is to add -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 to the Makefile flags for affected platforms, however there are a bunch of places where _GNU_SOURCE is already predefined

[13:32] <nwc10> I think that bit of knowledge is worth more than 2c :-)

[13:33] <brrt> i didn't fix it last time i encountered it because i wasn't 100% sure which would be best; either to add it wherever pthread_yield is called or to remove it from wherever it is defined and deifne it in a global place

[13:34] <brrt> and i was lazy at the time
