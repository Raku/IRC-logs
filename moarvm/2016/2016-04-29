[10:27] <jnthn> Very weird crash. I end up with a MVMCode pointing to an MVMFrame that is in fromspace. The MVMCode itself is in gen2, but marked as being in an inter-gen set.

[11:03] <jnthn> I suspected something with the inter-gen sets, but even when I hack stuff so we never remove from them, all is still fine

[11:09] <jnthn> uh

[11:09] <jnthn> all is still crashy :)

[11:19] <jnthn> I think I've tested 5 things that could be broken so far and none of them seem to be to blame...

[11:19] <jnthn> lunch &
