[13:40] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 25 commits to MoarVM/smoke-me/spaceybuild by coke

[13:56] <[Coke]> https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125501 - anyone building moarvm on windows who can help this guy? (main thing at this point is probably to have him try again, since it's been sitting there for a year.)

[13:57] <[Coke]> (in general, I'd ping them, give them a week or two to respond, then close the ticket asking them to reopen if needed)
