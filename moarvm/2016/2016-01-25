[09:52] <brrt> for my own record-keeping; after tiler-linearisation i removed the special-purpose logic for the 'magic' registers, which trips up the register allocator

[09:52] <brrt> might as well move it to offline at this stage

[10:19] <timotimo> heyo brrt :)

[10:19] <brrt> hi timotimo

[10:20] <brrt> i wonder if the JIT is just especially unforgiving to to quick hacks and cheating, or whether i'm simply doing something wrong

[10:22] <timotimo> i can verily imagine the first be true

[10:22] <brrt> hmm

[10:23] <brrt> maybe it is interesting to consider a more specific jit testing system

[10:24] <moritz> it's a bit like working with the GC; you cheat, it cheats you

[10:25] <brrt> right :-0

[10:25] <brrt> that is an excellent comparison
