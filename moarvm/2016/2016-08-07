[07:43] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[08:17] <brrt> lizmat: roosendaal?

[10:01] <brrt> lunch &

[11:01] *** brrt joined
[11:31] *** edehont joined
[12:23] <brrt> why.. why does moar insist that i'm on version 2016.06 when i've justed merged origin/master and VERSION clearly contains 2016.07

[12:24] <timotimo> surely you've re-configured already

[12:24] <brrt> yes

[12:24] <brrt> and again and again and again

[12:24] <timotimo> and ./moar --version will also give you the wrong result?

[12:26] <brrt> yes

[12:26] <brrt> src/gen/config.h also gives me the wrong result...

[12:27] <timotimo> weird

[12:27] <timotimo> and we just use VERSION to get that information?

[12:27] <brrt> ahah, i know

[12:27] <timotimo> or git?

[12:27] <brrt> i haven't committed the merge just yet

[12:27] <moritz> git clean -xdf # deletes all files that aren't under version control

[12:28] <moritz> that's my go-to approach for fixing build system weirdness

[12:28] <brrt> so git thinks i'm still on the 2016.06 tag

[12:29] <timotimo> ah

[12:36] <brrt> committing fixes that

[12:46] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 35 commits to MoarVM/even-moar-jit by bdw

[12:46] <brrt> and, we're up to date again

[13:43] *** brrt joined
[13:47] <brrt> hmm, one of my minor nitpicks

[13:47] <brrt> i'd like the append_call_c to be varargish
