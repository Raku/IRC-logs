[10:42] <dogbert17_> running htmlify.p6 with GC_DEBUG and a 48k nursery is a slow process, has been running for ~15 hours so far and still has a ways to go, hopefully done when I get home from $work

[10:44] <jnthn> o.O :)

[10:44] <jnthn> That's quite some torture

[13:55] <brrt> hi jnthn

[13:55] <brrt> i've started on the template pointer removal bit. it was somewhat harder than anticipated

[13:56] <jnthn> /o\

[13:57] * jnthn by contrast just got done implementing Test::Scheduler

[13:57] <jnthn> Which is good because now I can use it to write my advent post :P

[13:57] <timotimo> ooooh, virtual time!

[13:58] <brrt> yes, i'm very curious about that, too

[13:59] <timotimo> i'm not sure i konw what you're refering to for the pointer removal thing

[14:05] <brrt> timotimo: the MVMJitTile structure is, in a way, not sufficiently self-contained yet

[14:05] <timotimo> oh, ok, so it can't be realloced for example?

[14:05] <brrt> no, that's not what i mean

[14:06] <brrt> i mean that it relies for some information on the presence of a pointer to the template that generated it

[14:06] <brrt> that prevents me from making synthetic ones without a template

[14:06] <timotimo> oh

[14:06] <timotimo> so you'd have to do the same thing we do with PHI nodes?

[14:07] <brrt> hmm, no, what do you do with PHI nodes?

[14:07] <timotimo> we have to create the info struct for all these ops

[14:07] <timotimo> because they all have different number of arguments

[14:07] <timotimo> and we need a struct that has that number stored in it

[14:28] <brrt> aha

[14:28] <brrt> yeah, then it is a bit similar, but also a bit different

[14:28] <timotimo> :)

[14:28] <timotimo> ISTR i built an optimization where we share those structs

[14:29] <timotimo> because we tended to allocate a whole bunch of 'em during spesh time

[14:29] <brrt> so it turns out that I used the presence of a template as a check 'does this thing yield a value'

[14:29] <brrt> uhuh

[14:29] <timotimo> oops :)

[14:29] * timotimo needs AFK a bit

[14:29] <brrt> ok, see you in a bit

[14:30] <brrt> (the tl;dr is that I have an answer ready for that, it's just that I wanted to introduce it later, and now i have to introduce it earlier)

[14:30] <brrt> anyway, i'm afk as well
