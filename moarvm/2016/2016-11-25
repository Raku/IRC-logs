[11:03] * viki clears throat

[11:03] <viki> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/442

[11:13] * brrt checks out

[11:14] <brrt> i have no idea why that should do what you mean :-)

[11:16] <viki> You mean why 1 / 2**1020 should be a proper number and not 0?

[11:16] <viki> r: use nqp; nqp::div_In(1, 2**1020)

[11:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64343d, rakudo-jvm 76b061: ( no output )

[11:16] <viki> r: use nqp; say nqp::div_In(1, 2**1020)

[11:16] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 76b061: OUTPUT«8.9E-308␤»

[11:16] <camelia> ..rakudo-moar 64343d: OUTPUT«0␤»

[11:16] <viki> r: use nqp; say nqp::div_In(2**1020, 1)

[11:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64343d: OUTPUT«Inf␤»

[11:16] <camelia> ..rakudo-jvm 76b061: OUTPUT«1.1235582092889474E307␤»

[11:17] <viki> And since that stuff is used by Perl 6's Rats, we get:

[11:17] <viki> r: say 1/2**1020

[11:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64343d: OUTPUT«0␤»

[11:17] <camelia> ..rakudo-jvm 76b061: OUTPUT«8.9E-308␤»

[11:17] <viki> r: say 1e0/2e0**1020

[11:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64343d: OUTPUT«8.90029543402881e-308␤»

[11:17] <camelia> ..rakudo-jvm 76b061: OUTPUT«8.900295434028806E-308␤»

[11:17] <viki> etc

[11:52] <viki> .ask MasterDuke can you look at this ticket? IIRC we decided this was a DITHWIDT and wasn't worth a fix, right? https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128551

[11:52] <yoleaux2> viki: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[11:53] <viki> oh whoops, wc

[15:01] <brrt> viki: I mean, I have no idea why that patch works

[15:01] <brrt> although I believe that it works

[15:02] <viki> brrt: it works because when we do MAX, in the case of 1/2**1020 you end up with 1 / 2 ** 57, which is less than zero and so the numerator ends up being zero.

[15:05] *** domidumont joined
[15:06] <viki> brrt: and the fix avoids that case, but I'm not 100% sure it's a good fix

[15:34] <brrt> honestly, I have no idea how IEEE floating point works at all

[19:49] <timotimo> i don't have an idea why IEEE floating points works at all ;)

[19:50] <moritz> I don't hae any idea if IEEE floating points work at all ;)
