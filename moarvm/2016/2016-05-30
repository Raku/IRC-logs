[08:08] <jnthn> moarning o/

[08:30] <brrt> jnthn, how worthwhile do you think it will be to allow the interpreter to get the JIT entry label?

[08:31] <brrt> eh, well, to be exact

[08:31] <jnthn> brrt: Can it not today? :)

[08:31] <brrt> very well

[08:31] <brrt> :-)

[08:31] <brrt> busy day today?

[08:31] <jnthn> heh, that wasn't the parse I expected :P

[08:32] <jnthn> "Can the interpreter not already discover that today?" :)

[08:32] <jnthn> ->jit_entry_label on frame or so

[08:33] <jnthn> I should probably have waited for the more exact :)

[08:33] <brrt> oh, that way

[08:33] <brrt> yeah, it can

[08:34] <brrt> what i mean is, it would be nice if the JIT didn't have to do the bookkeeping, but the interpreter could call a function (downstack from the JIT), which would give you that offset, just from the return address of the function

[08:34] <brrt> i.e. MVM_jit_get_reentry_label(MVMThreadContext *tc, void *jit_code_base, size_t jit_code_size)

[08:35] <brrt> the downside is that we would have to compile with -fno-omit-frame-pointer

[08:35] <brrt> and the equivalent in MSVC

[08:35] <brrt> i can write that function is assembly easily enough

[08:35] <brrt> getting it to link correctly on multiple platforms, that is one minor annoyance

[08:36] <jnthn> How much of a saving do you think it would be?

[08:36] <brrt> i don't know. we currently insert 'store reentry labels' every basic block, every invokish, every throwish thing

[08:37] <brrt> even if they may not throw or invoke at all

[08:37] <jnthn> I'm assuming -fno-omit-frame-pointer costs a little bit too, though maybe not so much on x64 as on x86...

[08:37] <brrt> that is quite a bit of memory traffic

[08:37] <jnthn> Since the former is less register starved

[08:37] <brrt> agreed

[08:37] <brrt> only way to know is to measure i think....

[08:37] <jnthn> And since we don't JIT on x86 we could only set the flag on x64

[08:38] <brrt> it might hurt the interpreter a bit, but i don't know that

[08:38] <brrt> how much

[08:40] <jnthn> Yeah. It's hard to guess these things, but while it may be quite a bit of memory traffic, it's also (a) likely to be a cache hit most of the time, and (b) doens't have a data dep

[08:40] <brrt> also gtrue

[08:41] <brrt> same is true for stack walking of course

[08:58] *** zakharyas joined
[09:09] <brrt> i wonder if there is a practical way to make cross platform c-linkable assembly
