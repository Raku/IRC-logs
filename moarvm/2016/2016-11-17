[07:18] <brrt> good * #maorvm

[07:18] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[07:18] <nwc10> as you can see, I transposed the "oo"s in good and the "rr"s in brrt, just like your transposed letters :-)

[07:20] <nine> nwc10 has obviously a more appropriate caffeine level than me

[07:20] <nine> need to fix that...

[07:20] <nwc10> Well, I met the (to be) neighbour at the station, so was chatting on the train (in German) instead of the usual sleeping

[07:21] <nwc10> *and* I've just chatted to the office admin

[07:21] <nwc10> (in English)

[07:21] <nwc10> so I've had 2 conversations more than usual

[07:21] <nwc10> so I'm forced to be awake

[07:21] <nwc10> the (to be) neighbour is very nice - our building site's water supply is from his well

[07:21] <nwc10> (this is very cost effective)

[07:22] <nwc10> but he's warning me that he'll need to turn it off if there's likely to be a hard frost

[07:22] <nwc10> (this is sane)

[07:30] <brrt> wait, what, you have, heh

[07:30] <brrt> you have water supply from a well?

[07:31] * brrt is almost as shocked as when he heard that german houses are often fueled by a residential oil tank

[07:32] <brrt> (in the netherlands, all housed are fuel from a natural gas grid, and having anything else is quite unimaginable)

[07:32] <nwc10> this is their garden water tap

[07:32] <nwc10> one of the houses we looked at last year when thinking about buying had an oil heating system

[07:32] <nwc10> the garden water comes from a well, so isn't metered

[07:32] <nwc10> (well, the electricity to power the pump is, but that's a trivial cost)

[07:33] <brrt> well, then you are of course in luck in that you have sufficiently fresh water nearby

[07:33] <brrt> i wouldn't dare do that in Eutrophia^W the netherlands

[07:33] <nwc10> this criteria makes the entire Netherlands lucky?

[07:33] <nwc10> sometimes far too lucky?

[07:33] <nwc10> (This isn't drinking water)

[07:33] <brrt> ah, okay

[07:34] <brrt> hence my surprise

[07:34] <brrt> actually there are parts of the netherlands tht are quite dry in the summer

[07:34] * nwc10 has to look up eutrophia

[07:34] <nwc10> I think I get the joke

[07:34] <brrt> :-)

[07:35] <brrt> mostly also by human hands, by the way, after the original vegetation was stripped away

[09:26] <lizmat> good *, #moarvm

[09:28] <lizmat> jnthn: if $a and $b are shaped lists, it looks like "nqp::atpos($a,$_) = nqp::atpos($b,$_ for ^5)" works differently from unshaped lists

[09:28] <lizmat> jnthn: that's really the underlying problem it appears

[09:29] <lizmat> or should I always bind to a new scalar ?

[09:31] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe my understanding of the left-valuedness of nqp::atpos is wrong

[09:39] <lizmat> afk&

[09:49] <brrt> good *, lizmat

[10:53] <lizmat> jnthn: figured out the thinko: the problem is indeed in .STORE

[10:54] <lizmat> or at least in the interaction between .reverse and .STOR

[10:54] <lizmat> E

[10:55] <lizmat> .reverse and .rotate basically create a List with the same containers from the original List/Array, but in different order

[10:56] <lizmat> the normal List/Array.STORE always go through a rather elaborated scheme using iterators

[10:56] <lizmat> with the shaped array.STORE I thought I could take a shortcut, because all elements are always reified

[10:57] <lizmat> turns out I can't, generally

[11:07] <nwc10> lizmat: based on conversations yesterday, jnthn is very busy with Struggle for Freedom and Democracy Day" today.

[11:08] <lizmat> SFDD ??

[11:09] <lizmat> nwc10 jnthn see: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2d56751

[11:10] <nwc10> lizmat: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2016-11-16#i_13577800

[11:47] <jnthn> lizmat: Yes, that fix looks safer. Also I suspect before it we might have had odd behavior if you bound an element of the array, then stored new stuff in said array...

[11:47] <jnthn> Some things are best not cheated on :)
