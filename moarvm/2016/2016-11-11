[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Store index of tile value with use and definition

[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: This ensures that the live range maps completely to the tiles

[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: that use it and that these tiles can be updated when a register

[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: is assigned.

[07:32] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2e6e16f17b

[07:35] <brrt> going further will require me to continue with the tile structure redesign

[07:35] <brrt> i.e. breaking existing code
