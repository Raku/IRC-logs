[12:07] <jnthn> Now that's what I call speedup

[12:07] <moritz> what did you do?

[12:07] <nwc10> something like this? http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25

[12:07] <jnthn> moritz: Taught the multi-dispatch cache to know about named parameters

[12:08] <jnthn> So that `my %h = a => 1; my ($a, $b); for ^20000 { $a = %h<a>:exists; $b = %h<b>:exists; }; say $a; say $b` now runs in about 5.7% of the CPU cycles it did previously

[12:08] <jnthn> m: say 899494604 R/ 15829808376

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8ab6db: OUTPUT«17.5985584634␤»

[12:09] <jnthn> Spectesting now to see if there's fallout

[12:09] <nwc10> Intel (and the other CPU manufacturers) aren't going to be happy

[12:13] <nwc10> the rest of us owe you a brewery

[12:13] <nwc10> although hopefully you'd accept a few barrels, as they're easier to move.

[12:14] <jnthn> Hm, do I need to put "Has a bar" onto the house-shopping criteria list... :P

[12:15] <timotimo> it should also have a foo, though

[12:16] <jnthn> One spectest fail, but it turns out that my Rakudo is behind and it was a test added very recently

[12:16] <timotimo> fantastic

[12:16] <dalek> MoarVM: cffe519 | jnthn++ | src/ (3 files):

[12:16] <dalek> MoarVM: Start exploring a new multi-cache design.

[12:16] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:16] <dalek> MoarVM: This can handle named parameters also, and uses callsite interning to

[12:16] <dalek> MoarVM: do less checks, and a tree rather than array or arrays for similar

[12:16] <jnthn> That was the merge of the new multi cache into Moar

[12:16] <nwc10> sadly I didn't take a picture of the pipe bridge at the local brewery else that would seem appropriate

[12:16] <nwc10> (the other side of the road is now building houses)

[12:16] <nwc10> although I don't actually know what used to be in the pipes, or whether it was drinkable

[12:16] *** dalek joined
[12:18] <timotimo> jnthn: any clue how faster or slower the cache is compared to before the new design?

[12:20] <jnthn> Well, on the benchmark in question just adopting the new cache without updating Rakudo took us from 15,829,808,376 to 15,817,189,228 cycles

[12:20] <timotimo> that's because it says "no" faster?

[12:20] <jnthn> So "a wee bit faster"

[12:20] <jnthn> Well, I don't know :)

[12:21] <jnthn> It can be that, or it can be that other times (during compilation etc.) that we hit it, we're getting faster results too

[12:21] <timotimo> makes sense, yeah

[12:21] <timotimo> good work all in all :) :)

[12:21] <jnthn> I suspect careful further profiling and tweaking can get more wins.

[12:21] <jnthn> Also we can do a hash-y thing at multiple levels too

[12:22] <timotimo> mhm

[12:22] <timotimo> whereever we have very many different things at the same value

[12:22] <jnthn> So there's plenty of ways to be more clever.

[12:22] <jnthn> At the same time, there's also questions of how big a win it will be

[12:22] <timotimo> of course

[12:23] <jnthn> Because when we spesh, we can either inline a multi or at least emit a direct call to said multi in various cases.

[12:23] <jnthn> In which case we don't hit the cache at all

[12:23] <jnthn> (Becase we don't need to look up)

[13:43] <nwc10> (sort of old news)

[13:43] <nwc10> (and it was funny in 1980 and 2008. Now, I don't know)

[13:43] <nwc10> (and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trw1PbQt_Yo and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmOvEwtDycs )

[13:43] <nwc10> and sadly probably a whole lot more

[14:03] <jnthn> "It's what made Britain great"...so we need to Make Britain Great Again? :P

[14:04] <nwc10> yes. obviously s/United Kingom/Great Britain/  (possibly I mean both readings of that as jokes, but I was intending the geographical one)

[14:05] <jnthn> .oO( Disunited kingdom... )

[14:25] <nwc10> to paraphrase Steve Jobs, "There's a flag for that": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg

[14:26] <nwc10> (un)doing things in different orders would need brave new flags.

[18:04] <timotimo> after this feature, the next progress report will probably be quite fantastic :)

[18:08] <nwc10> I hope.

[18:08] <nwc10> I fear that I've distracted jnthn with Yes Minister

[18:09] <jnthn> Heh, no, my wife arrived home her trip, so been relaxing, eating, etc. :)
