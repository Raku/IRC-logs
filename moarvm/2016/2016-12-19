[09:06] <samcv> hi having a problem. getting, can't find moar.so

[09:06] <samcv> used perl Configure.pl --prefix="$HOME/perl6"

[09:06] <samcv> pretty sure that's what i used before, i mean that's where i have all my moar/nqp/rakudo things

[09:07] <samcv> am I doing something wrong?

[09:08] <samcv> nqp said my moar was too old, so i pull'd and then ran make again... and then broke :(

[09:10] <samcv> nine, you broke my Moar ._.

[09:10] <samcv> reverted that last commit. and works fine

[09:13] <samcv> just read through all the scrollback hah. looks like others had problems

[09:52] <nine> Ah, damn. It probably worked on my machine because I still had the moarvm rpm installed when testing install to a private path.

[09:53] <nine> Sorry folks :/

[09:53] <timotimo> oops! :)

[09:54] <dogbert17_> heh, "Must not GC when in the specializer/JIT"

[09:55] <dogbert17_> this I haven't seen before

[09:56] <jnthn> Yeah, that was added last week

[09:56] <jnthn> To panic instead of corrupt memory :)

[09:57] <jnthn> Also, the stack trace of the point in panics will be useful for fixing it :)

[09:57] <dogbert17_> jnthn: will this do as report material? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/4c7d21ce1f075473c1ab0411cf3c3260

[09:58] <timotimo> oooh, demand_extop, eh?

[09:58] <timotimo> because it locks + unlocks the mutex?

[09:59] <timotimo> i expect we'd mark a thread blocked before and unblocked after spesh anyway, right?

[09:59] <timotimo> at least ... we probably should? except spesh is supposed to be blistering fast anyway :P

[10:00] <jnthn> dogbert17_: Yup

[10:01] <dogbert17_> cool, I'll add it as a MoarVM issue

[10:05] *** pyrimidine joined
[10:10] <dogbert17_> btw, are there any other flags apart from FSA_SIZE_DEBUG and MVM_GC_DEBUG that might be useful to turn on for bug hunting purposes?

[10:12] <timotimo> depends on what kind of bug you're hunting

[10:13] <timotimo> if there is/you're suspecting a spesh bug, there's a tool that'll help identify the offending frame for you

[10:13] <jnthn> There's also various others that turn on extra debug output

[10:13] <jnthn> But you need to know what kind of problem you're looking at for them to be much use

[10:14] <jnthn> Doubly so given extra output introduces timing effects that can hide certain problems you might be hunting

[10:14] <dogbert17_> thx for the explanantion, I guess I'll stick with the ones above for the time being then :-)

[10:15] <jnthn> For example, there's ways to turn on logging output for GC orchestration and deopt

[10:16] <jnthn> Though both produce a decent amount of into that is likely to be meaningless for most bug hunts

[10:17] <dogbert17_> ok, I'll definitely stick to the above two then, at least until they are exhausted :-)

[10:24] <timotimo> oh, hm, it's more nuanced than setting gc to blocked when spesh runs

[10:25] <timotimo> because we do have many spots that have interactions with the gc, such as log entries

[10:25] <timotimo> and spesh slots

[10:28] <jnthn> Far more

[10:28] <jnthn> The spesh rule is that GC never takes place while it's running

[10:30] <timotimo> right. so we'll need an API (or maybe only usable by spesh? though extops can also define spesh) that locks and unlocks mutexes without doing the blocked/unblocked thing

[10:31] <jnthn> It's not that simple

[10:31] <jnthn> The holder of the mutex might have decided to do GC

[10:31] <jnthn> Then deadlock

[10:33] <timotimo> ugh.

[10:46] <timotimo> .o( but i thought acquiring a mutex marks a thread as blocked anyway? )

[13:25] <SmokeMachine> Any one have any idea what could be causing this? https://gist.github.com/FCO/bb1bb1c0285fcfa12d8f2d8789beb21f

[13:26] <[Coke]> open an RT with both the source and the bt.

[13:27] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: but the source is too big... I'm trying to reduce it...

[13:28] <timotimo> SmokeMachine: att he point of an explosion, you can "call MVM_print_backtrace(tc)" (or what it's called) and get a stack trace from inside your program

[13:28] <timotimo> that can help guide the golfing effort

[13:37] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: No symbol "MVM_print_backtrace" in current context.

[13:37] <timotimo> then it must be MVM_dump_backtrace

[13:37] <nine> yep it's MVM_dump_backtrace

[13:38] <nine> also you may have to up a couple of times

[13:38] <timotimo> not in that stack trace, though, as it's inside a gc_mark function

[13:44] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: worked! \o/ ^^

[13:53] <SmokeMachine> looks that's an error on (|) op

[14:15] <timotimo> it's quite unlikely that it has anything to do with (|) itself

[14:15] <timotimo> probably something between then and the previous GC run?
