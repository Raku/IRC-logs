[04:46] <jdv79> how can it happen that UTF8_ACCEPT but codepoint to grapheme is not ready?

[06:33] *** domidumont joined
[06:39] <jdv79> nevermind.  i partially figured out the issues.

[09:09] <konobi> complete with perl tool!

[09:09] <konobi> =0)

[10:57] <jnthn> konobi: We already include something a bit like that in the profiler output. :) Except I mind them easier to read when inverted, so it's an icycle graph rather than a flame graph. :)

[10:57] <timotimo> icycle graphs are cool

[10:58] <timotimo> also, iCycle is obviously an apple product

[10:58] <nine> Certainly cooler than flame graphs ;)

[11:00] <konobi> jnthn: it supports icycle

[11:01] <jnthn> haha...the apple bike :P

[11:01] <jnthn> konobi: Cool ;-)

[11:02] <jnthn> Guess I also like cold things much better than hot things, so... :)

[11:02] * psch ponders how apples hardware lock-down would look on a bike

[11:02] * psch .oO( "damn, another flat tire, guess i can throw this one away too..." )

[11:03] <timotimo> can't get a flat tire, because the whole bike is one piece of aluminium

[11:04] <timotimo> tires, seat, light... :P

[11:04] <nine> And it's super flat, including the seat

[11:04] <timotimo> :D :D :D

[11:04] <konobi> jnthn: there's a bunch of support features, etc. mentioned towards the end of the article

[11:04] <nine> Might hurt a bit, but it sure looks cool

[11:04] <timotimo> what do you call bikes in english that you lie on instead of sitting?

[11:05] <konobi> jnthn: it's also important to profile the code in place to see if the code is making libc calls inappropriately (for example)

[11:05] <timotimo> because, imagine one of those, except it's as flat as a macbook

[11:05] <psch> and if you can't reach the pedals it's because you're sitting on it wrong /o\

[11:06] <timotimo> :D

[11:08] <psch> nevermind that those are also flat on the rest of the flat bike vOv

[11:13] <nwc10> timotimo: recumbent

[11:13] <timotimo> ah, yes

[13:49] <nine> Somehow the notion of manually numbered branches in a version control system seems just wrong

[13:50] <timotimo> well, it's because i don't want to force-push over my rebases

[13:52] <ilmari> why not? if the old branch is obsolete by the rebase

[13:52] <timotimo> *shrug*

[13:52] <timotimo> it's a thing i've just started to do at least a year ago. i could force-push instead
