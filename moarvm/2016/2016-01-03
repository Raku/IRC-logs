[16:25] <FROGGS> is somebody here that can help me with a piece of code where select() is not working?

[16:36] <FROGGS> nvm, got it

[16:37] <FROGGS> the first param of select() is kind of confusing

[16:38] <FROGGS> it is *not* the number of file descriptors, it is the integer value of the biggest fd plus one

[16:55] <moritz> wtf.

[17:04] <leont> Yes. select() is like one of the worst interfaces ever.

[17:05] <leont> It makes sense when you understand how it's implemented, but what were they thinking?

[18:54] <FROGGS> they were thinking: "let's keep it simple... for us"

[19:06] <timotimo> probably more like they're worrying about performance?

[19:13] <virtualsue> more like, the world was quite different when that call was invented and it was erm, set in stone quite early

[19:13] <virtualsue> this is quite unlike the prevailing perl6 philosophy :-)

[19:28] <moritz> but yes, worrying (that much) about performance is also part of the world being quite different back then

[19:33] <moritz> today we also realize that when an API is shitty, people write wrappers which again have a performance penalty

[19:45] <virtualsue> we were allowed to worry a little more about performance in those days, as we weren't quite as spoiled as we are now, though wonderfully written treatises about premature optimisation were just as relevant then

[19:48] <virtualsue> just this morning i saw someone writing up a sincere concern that map was 150x slower than a for loop, which leads me to believe that this issue will never quite go away :-)

[19:48] <timotimo> wow, 150x is kind of harsh

[19:48] <virtualsue> or better stated, just plain wrong

[19:50] <timotimo> i mean, it's probably not noticable unless you hit really huge lists?

[19:50] <virtualsue> it was just wrong

[19:50] <timotimo> oh?

[19:50] <timotimo> how so?

[19:51] <timotimo> i mean, which of the many mistake that you can make was made in this case?

[19:51] <virtualsue> his code was not correct and the benchmarking method was not sound.

[19:51] <timotimo> ah, hehe.

[19:51] <timotimo> yeah, that's quite difficult to get right unless you spedn a bunch of time learning about that kind of stuff
