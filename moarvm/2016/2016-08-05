[19:21] <hoelzro> o/ jnthn

[19:22] <hoelzro> happy i11l beer day indeed!

[19:23] * hoelzro .oO( that numeronym must be hellish with some fonts )

[19:35] <brrt> is it?

[19:35] <brrt> omg

[19:35] <brrt> i have nothing in store

[19:35] *** edehont joined
[19:37] <hoelzro> I think I have a few in the fridge for when I get home ;)

[19:38] <brrt> quick, help me decide what beer to get

[19:38] <brrt> i have about 20 minutes left

[19:39] <hoelzro> something Belgian?

[19:39] <hoelzro> that's my metric

[19:39] <brrt> well, alright...

[19:39] <hoelzro> dammit, missed opportunity for a pun

[19:40] <brrt> i'll find something

[19:40] <brrt> bbl

[19:40] <hoelzro> godspeed

[19:54] *** edehont joined
[20:04] *** brrt joined
[20:04] <brrt> and, i've beer

[20:04] <brrt> not belgian

[20:04] <brrt> german, in fact

[20:05] <hoelzro> that's good too

[20:09] <brrt> it can be :-)

[20:10] <brrt> oh man i'm so going to miss yapc::eu this year :-(

[20:12] * jnthn ended up with a Czech porter :)

[20:12] <jnthn> brrt: (YAPC) Me too :-(

[20:13] <brrt> sucks doesn't it

[20:13] * brrt looks up what kind of beer porter is

[20:14] <hoelzro> mmmmmm porter

[20:14] <jnthn> Very much like stout

[20:14] <brrt> dark, it appears

[20:14] <brrt> interestingly, don't drink dutch beer

[20:14] <jnthn> Indeed :)

[20:14] <brrt> dutch beer is sugared pilsner

[20:14] <jnthn> Which Dutch beer? :)

[20:14] <jnthn> There is good Dutch beer. :)

[20:14] <brrt> heineken, amstel, bavaria, those

[20:15] <brrt> well, like? :-)

[20:15] <jnthn> oh, right...yeah, skip those

[20:15] <jnthn> http://brouwerijdemolen.nl/

[20:17] <brrt> never heard of that one

[20:19] * hoelzro misses brouwerij t'ij

[20:19] <jnthn> I've been able to pick up their beer in both Sweden and Czechia, so they can't be all that small. :)

[20:19] <brrt> how come you all know more about dutch breweries than i do :-o

[20:19] <jnthn> It's certainly not the kind of beer you'd find in a supermarket though...at least, not here. Have to go to a good beer store for it.

[20:20] <hoelzro> well, I lived in NL for two years =)

[20:20] <jnthn> Maybe the same in .nl too :)

[20:20] <hoelzro> and I took a lot of opportunities to sample the local beer

[20:21] <hoelzro> I remember having a really good beer at the NQP workshop in Frankfurt

[20:21] <hoelzro> Andechs, I think?

[20:21] <hoelzro> sadly, I don't think you can buy it in the US ='(

[20:21] <brrt> there are no beer shops where i'm living... :-(

[20:21] <hoelzro> ouch

[20:21] <brrt> there are licquor stores, but that's really a different thing

[20:23] <hoelzro> I know what you mean

[20:24] <hoelzro> Chicago has liquor stores, but I'm moving back to my home state in a few weeks, and we have no shortage of beer in Wisconsin =)

[20:24] * brrt has about the same knowledge of american states as many americans have of european countries

[20:25] <jnthn> La Trappe is also from .nl and perhaps more widespread, and while I prefer De Molen, La Trappe is a big improvement on Heineken and co. :-)

[20:25] <brrt> yes, la trappe is nice

[20:25] <hoelzro> ooo La Trappe

[20:25] <brrt> although they are almost belgian

[20:26] <hoelzro> I miss Leffe - you can get (some of) it here, but it's really expensive

[20:26] <hoelzro> I don't think I've seen Leffe Bruin in the US, which I really liked =/

[20:27] <brrt> okay, now i'm not sure whether leffe is belgian or dutch

[20:27] <hoelzro> I think it's belgian?

[20:27] <brrt> i should try de moeln once

[20:27] <brrt> *molen

[20:28] <jnthn> Pretty sure Leffe is Belgian. :)

[20:28] <jnthn> Earlier this year I got my hands on a real Kwak glass and now can drink it the proper way :)

[20:28] <jnthn> Well "proper"...I haven't gone so far as to hire out a horse and carriage :P

[20:29] *** edehont joined
[20:29] <hoelzro> hehe

[20:33] * timotimo has cheap bitter lemon

[20:33] * hoelzro .oO( weak lemon drink? )

[20:34] <timotimo> .o( bitte ein lemon )

[20:36] <hoelzro> haha

[20:44] <timotimo> i miss green tea kitkat :(

[20:44] <jnthn> Oh my... Is it any better than green tea ice cream?

[20:45] <jnthn> 'cus I found that stuff a bit odd :)

[20:45] <timotimo> hm, i liked green tea ice cream, but i haven't had much of it yet

[20:46] <timotimo> i've only had two or three of the small kitkats in that flavour when liz and wendy picked me up after having traveled to japan for YAPC::Asia

[20:46] <timotimo> so i've already forgotten all the tasty details

[20:46] <hoelzro> my wife and I had cherry blossom kit kats when we went to Japan

[20:46] <hoelzro> green tea would probably have been better

[20:47] <hoelzro> but I was macha'd out by the time we left Kyoto

[20:47] * jnthn doesn't get along with fish/seafood, and so has a slightly harder time with food in Japan

[20:48] <jnthn> I have found plenty of things that I really enjoyed there, though. :)

[20:48] <jnthn> Hmmm...wonder if I could make tonkatsu at home...

[20:50] * timotimo also doesn't go near seafood

[20:50] <hoelzro> oh yum tonkatsu

[20:50] <hoelzro> my wife doesn't like seafood either

[20:50] <timotimo> there's twinkies in this shop

[20:51] <timotimo> i hear terrible things about twinkies

[20:51] <hoelzro> have you guys had okonomiyaki?

[20:51] <hoelzro> sooo good

[20:52] * timotimo hasn't

[20:52] <jnthn> My wife and I mostly overlap in our food likes/dislikes, which is pretty useful. There are a handful of things I like that she won't touch though :)

[20:52] <hoelzro> overlapping tastes help =)

[20:52] <hoelzro> okonomiyaki is like a secret dish that doesn't leave japan or something

[20:53] <hoelzro> I'd never heard of it, but we had it for our anniversary dinner

[20:53] <jnthn> If I've had okonomiyaki, I certainly forgot the name or didn't know that's what it's called :)

[20:53] <hoelzro> they call it a "Japanese pancake", but it's way better [.oO( batter? )] than any pancake's I've had

[20:53] <hoelzro> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki

[20:53] <jnthn> Yeah, just found that... Pretty sure I haven't had that.

[20:54] <hoelzro> I think that that's a bug in en_US, since we don't really have savory pancakes here

[20:54] <jnthn> It does look good :)

[20:54] <hoelzro> I highly recommend it =)

[20:54] <brrt> oh, that looks awesome

[20:54] <timotimo> i'm interested

[20:55] <jnthn> My wife doesn't like mushrooms, so when she's away somewhere or otherwise not in need of dinner I'll tend to end up making something with them.

[20:55] <jnthn> Recently discovered a pulao is a pretty good way to enjoy mushrooms

[20:57] <jnthn> 4803 3330 3258 0770 7269 7661 7465 611d

[20:57] <jnthn> uh, not this terminal :)

[21:00] <brrt> okay, i'm going to drink beer and be afk now

[21:00] <brrt> good food discussion today :-)

[21:00] <hoelzro> food++

[21:01] <jnthn> Have a nice evening! :)

[21:05] <timotimo> i'm glad i could derail this talk about beer (which i don't like) to food (which i do tend to like)

[21:06] <hoelzro> haha

[21:40] <timotimo> Red Band is good candy

[21:40] <timotimo> it's a .nl brand AFAIK
