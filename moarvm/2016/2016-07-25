[11:41] <brrt> ehm, you may with reason not believe me

[11:41] <jnthn> yeah, right

[11:41] <brrt> but i think i finally, really, truly know how to implement the register allocator 8-)

[11:41] <jnthn> \o/

[11:42] <brrt> so now the issue is to make time for it

[11:43] <brrt> one of the interesting bits is that i think i've discovered that linear scan (known as fast) is a subset of graph coloring

[11:43] <brrt> that is going to be a blogpost soonish

[11:44] <brrt> graph coloring is known as slow, because a): graph coloring is .... whatsitcalled? traveling-salesman-equivalent complexity

[11:44] <brrt> and linear scan is known as fast because linear

[11:45] <brrt> but in reality linear scan is just a special version of graph coloring

[11:46] <timotimo> NP-complete is the word you're looking for?

[11:46] <brrt> i.. think so

[11:46] <brrt> yeah, thanks :-)

[12:02] <arnsholt> That is indeed NP-complete

[12:03] <arnsholt> When I took a databases class some years ago, we spent quite a bit of time discussing serialization algorithms/strategies (that being rather important for databases)

[12:03] <brrt> uhuh

[12:03] <arnsholt> First we discussed locking, which has some obvious drawbacks, then we covered something called view-serializability (IIRC)

[12:03] <brrt> (fwiw, i'm not sure a live range in this model can still meanigfully live in two registers.... that just has to go then)

[12:03] <arnsholt> Think we spent like two lectures on it

[12:04] <brrt> do continue

[12:04] <arnsholt> And then at the end they just casually drop, "but this turns out to be NP-complete"

[12:04] <arnsholt> >>>>>>.<<<<<<<

[12:04] <brrt> lol

[12:04] <brrt> yeah, sucks when that happens

[12:05] <brrt> that basically happened to my idea of 'let's find the ideal combination of renewable generators for a given area'

[12:05] <brrt> 'this is going to be easy, just fill them up with the most ideal spots first... oh wait'

[12:05] <arnsholt> Yeah, turns out a rather large fraction of interesting problems are NP-complete

[12:09] <brrt> or solved by union-find

[12:10] <timotimo> when you get a job, you better find a union to join ...

[12:45] <brrt> :-)

[12:45] <brrt> okay, i'm off, i have to write thesis reports and stuff

[12:45] <brrt> see you later
