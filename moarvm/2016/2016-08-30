[05:56] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[05:56] <timotimo> good

[05:56] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[06:00] <brrt> are you going to APW?

[06:00] <timotimo> 'fraid not :(

[06:01] <timotimo> i only recently-ish found out, too :|

[06:01] <brrt> oh, about APW or about not going?

[06:02] <timotimo> the latter

[06:03] <brrt> oh... too bad

[06:03] <timotimo> it is

[06:04] <brrt> did you hear next years YAPC::EU is in amsterdam

[06:04] <timotimo> whoa

[06:04] <timotimo> that's not far away from me at all

[06:04] <timotimo> and far less far away from you

[06:04] <brrt> uhuh

[06:05] <brrt> a short morning commute in fact

[06:06] <brrt> this is something of a disadvantage as YAPC::EU used to be my holiday

[06:06] <timotimo> wow

[06:06] <brrt> and now i'll have to take an actual holiday instead

[06:07] <timotimo> a holiday well spent. though wouldn't booking actually sponsor your yapc attendance?

[06:07] <timotimo> what with being a heavily perl-using company?

[06:08] <brrt> probably yes

[06:09] <brrt> although at this time irrelevant

[06:09] <timotimo> fair enough

[06:09] <brrt> because amsterdam

[06:09] <timotimo> go to yapc, smoke weed every day! :P

[06:09] <brrt> hahaha

[06:10] <brrt> nitpicking: weed is not actually legal. it is just not policed

[06:10] * timotimo watches a little genetic AI thingie of little boxes going around randomly generated race tracks

[06:11] <brrt> where and how?

[06:11] <timotimo> http://ml-games.tomasz-rewak.com/

[06:13] * timotimo turned up the sensor length a fair bit to see how it changes the behavior

[06:13] <timotimo> in generation 17, the boxes tend to stop much more readily in turns

[06:14] <timotimo> i bet you can do some ridiculous stuff by changing the selection function

[06:14] <timotimo> like give boxes that turn more degrees per distance traveled

[06:14] <timotimo> might give you strong snaking motions perhaps?

[06:14] <brrt> possibly...

[06:15] <brrt> interesting

[06:15] <brrt> evolutiom is powerful

[06:15] <timotimo> tee hee, there was just now a turn that had at least seven boxes slowly crawl into the wall and "die" over the course of half a second

[06:15] <timotimo> yeah, but if you hire evolution to shoot the bad guys, make sure the bad guys isn't you

[06:16] * timotimo made the sensors much shorter now

[06:17] <brrt> dont hire anybody to shoot anyone

[06:18] <brrt> decommute &

[06:18] <timotimo> how dysfunctional will the boxes become when the sensor length doesn't suffice to see both walls at the same time when you're on the middle of the track ... :)

[06:19] <timotimo> hah, this one drives very slow through straight parts, but steps on the gas pedal once it reaches a curve

[06:20] <timotimo> it occurs to me that with even shorter sensor ranges the boxes might end up going the track in reverse direction

[06:20] <timotimo> this isn't really #moarvm talk, though

[06:20] <timotimo> unless our next code optimizer uses neural nets selected by genetic algorithms ... :)

[09:42] <timotimo> i hate when i see no BAIL lines for a routine, but still routines of that name show up as unjitted in the profile :(

[09:44] <moritz> do BAIL lines show up for routines that aren't called often enough to JIT them?

[09:48] <timotimo> no

[09:48] <timotimo> but when something gets called a literal million times, i'd expect it's hot

[09:48] <timotimo> also, the "Constructing jit graph" through "bytecode size: blah bytes" lines do show up for those routines

[13:25] <timotimo> it's amazing that jnthn was able to do all that with just 200 hours

[13:30] <moritz> aye, jnthn++
