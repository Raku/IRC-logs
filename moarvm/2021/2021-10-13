[06:28] <Nicholas> jdv: jnthnwrthngtn likes coffee. But sometimes his coffee machine doesn't like him. And sometimes I (also) have daft problems making coffee

[07:02] <Nicholas> good Universal Beverage Time, #moarvm

[07:03] * nine sticks to the traditional coffee

[07:03] *** bisectable6 joined
[07:03] <Nicholas> to be honest, right now I have regular coffee too

[07:04] <Nicholas> not some compromise-by-committee "brown liquid served with whipped cream and a straw" which was sort of what I was envisaging

[07:04] <Nicholas> (no, this is not me being infested with Vienese perverted ideas about what "cappochino" should mean, but more I started with "coke float" and then realised that ice cream wasn't likely to be univeral enough, but whipped cream seemed to be closer)

[07:05] <Nicholas> (I can't spell. This is not news)

[07:07] <nine> I did enjoy tee in the morning as well when I was at Liz and Wendy's but when my wife's first words in the morning are "I'd like coffee" there's just not much I can do :)

[07:53] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[07:55] <lizmat> so the good news is: getting back in the morning, my local dev version of the log server *did* start up correctly, reading all the available logs and growing to about 5G in memory

[07:55] <lizmat> no idea as to how long it too to get there, but my feeling is about an hour  :-(

[07:56] <nine> That sounds rather excessive
