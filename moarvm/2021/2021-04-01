[06:47] <nwc10> Beware - everything you read on the Internet today is unfunny and untrue. Including this statement.

[09:10] <lizmat> I don't agree.  It's not funny at all!  And true!

[09:48] <nwc10> attempted NULL pointer dereference. Nothing fishy reported by ASAN or valgrind before this

[09:48] <nwc10> have not attempted to bisect why this now goes boom

[09:49] <nwc10> or reduce it

[12:57] <dogbert17> a SEGV, interesting

[14:32] * dogbert17 dogbert's replication attempts are a total failure :(

[14:33] <nwc10> I have the 3 environment variables set

[14:33] <nwc10> plus

[14:33] <nwc10> +#define MVM_ARRAY_CONC_DEBUG 1

[14:33] <nwc10> +#define FSA_SIZE_DEBUG 1

[14:33] <nwc10> +#define MVM_GC_DEBUG 1

[14:33] <nwc10> +#define MVM_SPESH_CHECK_DU 1

[14:33] <dogbert17> you've it all it seems :)

[14:33] <nwc10> but it's probably some combination of MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 and MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1

[14:33] <nwc10> and I've not had time to dig

[14:35] <dogbert17> will try for a while longer now that I have more info

[14:37] <dogbert17> tw, what does ROAST_TIMING_SCALE=8 do? I have never used that.

[14:37] <dogbert17> *btw

[14:40] <nine> Prevents tests from timing out just because rakudo is slowed down by the debugging options

[14:40] <dogbert17> nine, thx

[16:19] <dogbert17> baam

[16:31] <dogbert17> oh, I can even get it to fail on every run

[16:44] <nine> most important step to fix it :)

[17:01] <dogbert17> nine: I simply removed the first seven tests from the file so that there were only four left. That did the trick.
