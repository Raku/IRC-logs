[11:16] <nine> I think we have a new contender for highest commit message length to patch length ratio :D https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/298298aaac65e71e610f6007a8bc957fe83daea1

[11:20] <cog> Nine, as a bystander so far, I appreciate all the pedagogical work done by the MoarVM contributors. Thx

[11:28] <nine> cog: you're welcome :)

[11:41] <bartolin_> nine++

[12:02] <dogbert11> nine++, soon there won't be a single MoarVM error left

[12:03] <dogbert11> it's getting increasingly hard to find new bugs but that's a good thing :)

[12:06] <MasterDuke> nine++

[12:07] <MasterDuke> dogbert11: btw, if you're looking for new ways to find bugs, both clang and gcc have static analyzers that have already found some legit bugs

[12:08] <MasterDuke> though gcc 11 should significantly improve its analyzer, so i'm waiting for it to really look at its output

[12:08] <nine> There's also still the spesh bug leading to "Cannot find method 'sink' on 'BOOTCode'" in t/spec/S17-supply/return-in-tap.t

[12:08] <cog> IN such specialised and difficult, more likely the lack of competent people. That's why it is important to cheer up the people who do the hard work.

[12:09] <nwc10> nine: gah, I think you win :-/

[12:11] <nwc10> So, I was a bit distracted a month ago, so forgot to mention https://blog.pyston.org/

[12:11] <nwc10> but anyway, it's 5 months now and *still* no other info

[12:11] <nwc10> I guess this ought to be the new schedule - Fibonaccii

[12:11] <nwc10> so I'll comment again in 8 months and 13 (etc)

[12:12] <nwc10> unless they actually share some new plan that can actually work on "how to monetise infrastrcture"

[12:12] <nwc10> https://www.pypy.org/blog/ doesn't have much news either

[12:21] * nwc10 re-reads

[12:22] <nwc10> nine: yes, you totally win. (and I hope nothing beats you in the future)

[12:23] <nwc10> doing the whitespace ignoring diff in my head, you changed two times if (...) { ... } to if (1) { ... }

[12:23] <nwc10> eliminated the if, removed the block, re-idented

[12:24] <nwc10> so effectively remove 2 lines. with 108 lines of commit message

[12:29] <dogbert11> There seems to be a GC error lurking somewhere

[12:29] <dogbert11> I get it when running t/spec/S17-procasync/stress.t

[12:31] <dogbert11> test 24 more specifically

[12:36] <nine> dogbert11: oh, I think I know why

[12:40] <dogbert11> cool, so you don't even need a gist :)

[12:42] <dogbert11> here it is anyway :) https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/9c2bd9353184e8bcafc101985db41633

[12:42] <nine> dogbert11: pushed a fix

[12:42] <dogbert11> you're fast

[12:42] <nine> Directly to master since it's embarassingly trivial...

[12:43] <nine> Once one asks the right question like "are there any existing MVMROOT that I need to add the new arguments to", they are surpringinly easy to answer...

[12:44] <dogbert11> nine++

[12:46] <dogbert11> a few quick test runs confirms that your fix works splendidly

[13:55] * lizmat just bumped MoarVM and nqp
