[08:06] <nine> I'm pretty sure now that the issue is indeed, that we take one deopting op (dispatch_o) and replace it with multiple guards. Only the first such guard re-uses the deopt annotation (thus retaining the deopt idx). The others will get clones of the annotation with new deopt_idxs.
[08:06] *** psydroid joined
[08:06] <nine> We won't find deopt usages for these new deopt_idxs.
[08:07] <nine> Aren't MVM_SPESH_ANN_DEOPT_SYNTH annotations the mechanism intended for precicely such situations?

[19:22] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/08/09/2021-32-firstcon-done/
[19:48] <timo> already using Comma already, lizmat? :)
[19:48] <lizmat> no, as it still chokes on handling the core setting afaik
[19:48] <lizmat> but am now convinced I should use it while developing my modules
[19:49] <lizmat> but deeply ingrained muscle memory is hard to change :-)
[19:52] <MasterDuke> yeah, i really would love for it to handle the core setting. i don't develop modules much, and vim is still what i instinctively reach for first for small scripts
[19:53] <MasterDuke> iirc it complains about something in the t/ directory. i tried excluding that directory in a *.iml file, but i couldn't get it working
[19:54] <timo> liz, i was pointing out a typo in your post :D
[19:55] <timo> its all right that you dont use comma for core rakudo wor
[19:56] <lizmat> timo: ah, that's more a grammo  :-)
[19:56] <lizmat> fixed, timo++
[19:56] <timo> the typo system is not strong enough to detect grammar mistakes
[19:57] <lizmat> afk for a bit&
