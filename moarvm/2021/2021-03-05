[18:37] <lizmat> Something weird going on with: my @a = ^100000; @a.sort: *.Str

[18:38] <lizmat> when you profile that, it appears that Mu.Bool takes about 50% of CPU of that code ?

[18:39] <lizmat> it *is* green in the profile, but it is not getting inlined

[18:39] <lizmat> it dispatches to Int.Bool but the proto is getting run over and over again

[18:39] <lizmat> Int.Bool only takes about 4%, so fixing this could make sorting about 2x as fast ?

[18:40] <lizmat> instigated by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66496614/raku-slow-mixes-sorting

[18:41] <lizmat> ok, small correction: I was running this with having changed the proto to () instead of (|)

[18:42] <lizmat> with () in the sig of the proto, it still takes 1/3 of CPU
