[15:26] <[Coke]> I need to get up to date on these new-fangled games.

[15:26] <[Coke]> I got a PS5 and have used it mainly to play PS4/Fallout4

[15:27] <timo> wow you got a ps5. did you have to hurt anybody for it?

[15:28] <MasterDuke58> horizon zero dawn is pretty much the newest game i have, but it isn't all that recent, 2017

[15:28] <[Coke]> timo: I had to hit refresh SO MANY TIMES

[15:28] <[Coke]> fallout 4 was 2015. :)

[15:30] <timo> i think the newest game i own is boyfriend dungeon,  which came out the other day but i havent played it yet. if i limit to games ive played that would probably be subnautica below zero

[15:30] <MasterDuke58> i just got in the virtual queue on amd.com a hour or so ago with a 45 min wait time, but got a notice 10 min in saying they were all out of video cards

[15:31] <MasterDuke58> heh, i just started playing the original subnautica a month or two ago because my daughter likes watching the "alien fish game"

[15:33] <timo> its super good

[15:33] <timo> snarky pda lady is a very good character

[15:35] <MasterDuke58> changing topics, anyone taken a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1528 ?

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: If logging the frame entry in the spesh log triggered a send_log and if that

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: happened precisely when some thread wanted start a GC run, the GC may have come

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: across a frame that had an uninitialized params sub-struct. This could cause us

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: to dereference uninitialized pointes resulting in segfaults.

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: Fix by initializing params before logging the frame entry with spesh, i.e.

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: doing something that could potentially enter the GC.

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: When running with spesh blocking, send_log creates a new spesh log entry with

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: an already locked mutex, then marks the current thread blocked for GC (which

[19:08] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: might enter the GC right away). The spesh worker thread picks up that spesh

[19:09] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: log and waits for the mutex. The spesh thread never joins the GC, so everyone

[19:09] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: ends up waiting.

[19:09] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[19:09] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: Fix by marking the spesh worker thread blocked for GC before acquiring the

[21:35] <[Coke]> I'm getting a failure trying to do a rakudo build on new-disp.

[21:36] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/86e97dd0690df1741bac29046155ac07

[21:42] <[Coke]> (started working in a fresher clone)

[22:04] <dogbert17> oh no, some has fixed all the new-disp bugs, now we'll have to find more :)

[22:04] <dogbert17> nine++

[22:04] <dogbert17> s/some/someone/

[22:05] <dogbert17> it seems that there are still things to do, e.g. 'MoarVM oops: Unknown handler in inline cache entry'

[22:06] <dogbert17> to repro run 'while ./rakudo-m -Ilib t/02-rakudo/15-gh_1202.t; do :; done' and wait, no special changes needed
