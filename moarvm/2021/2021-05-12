[10:26] <lizmat> this has been driving me crazy for the past hours: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/c165bb0cbf9d4af25499ce767486093d 

[10:26] <lizmat> the inner map never gets executed ?

[10:27] <lizmat> am I missing something ?

[10:28] <jnthn> `for`? :)

[10:28] <lizmat> for ?

[10:28] <lizmat> why would I need a for ?

[10:29] <jnthn> Because you want eager evaluation?

[10:29] <lizmat> ok, so it's a matter of it not pulling

[10:29] <lizmat> hmmm....

[10:29] <jnthn> If you have a map in a map, then it produces a Seq of Seq. The outer one is sunk. This does *not* descend into the inner one.

[10:30] <lizmat> aaaaahhhh   duh

[10:30] <lizmat> ok, thanks!

[10:30] <lizmat> do for it is then  !

[10:30] <jnthn> Why the do?

[10:30] <lizmat> because I want the result returned ?

[10:31] <jnthn> The result of...what? :)

[10:31] <lizmat> the golf was just that: a gold

[10:31] <lizmat> *golf

[10:31] <jnthn> Ah, OK. I mean, if the die never happens it means the inner map is never used by anything

[10:31] <lizmat> in my original code it was returning from a method

[10:32] <jnthn> I also wondered if you wanted a `flat` before the outermost map

[10:32] <jnthn> But hard to guess from the golf :)

[10:32] <lizmat> it's returning Slips 

[10:32] <jnthn> ah, OK

[10:33] <lizmat> I was refactoring a hash keyed on nicks, each with a hash keyed on dates, with messages as values

[10:34] <lizmat> instead of first selecting the nicks, and then go through all the dates

[10:35] <lizmat> i wanted to go over the dates, and then select the nicks

[10:35] <lizmat> that way, if a date *and* nick selection is done, it would need to do a lot less in most cases

[10:36] <jnthn> ah, I see
