[09:08] <jnthn> o/

[09:08] <tellable6> hey jnthn, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/a207c21ebc02885d57d6cfbed6370457

[09:12] <nwc10> \o

[09:23] <jnthn> .tell MasterDuke Well, in RakuAST, make the For statement node be a RakuAST::CheckTime, and implement PERFORM-CHECK, then grab the block, see if it's pointy, grab its signature, and see if its empty (note it'd be done on AST nodes, not meta-objects)

[09:23] <tellable6> jnthn, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[18:52] <nine> dogbert17: so what's it segfaulting on?

[19:09] <dogbert17> I'm trying to figure that out, when compiling with --no-optimize the SEGV gets elusive

[19:10] <dogbert17> perhaps I'm misunderstanding your question

[19:24] <dogbert17> turn on opts again I now I got - MoarVM panic: non-AsyncTask fetched from eventloop active work list

[19:31] <dogbert17> nine: it seems as if the variable test is NULL on line 496

[19:40] <dogbert17> I should also mention that I'm running with a tiny nursery (8k)
