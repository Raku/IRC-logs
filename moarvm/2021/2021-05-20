[07:22] <Nicholas> Well, the hostname matches. I don't know who registered "Nicholas" on freenode, bceause they don't even show up on whowas
[07:22] <Nicholas> so I pounced.
[07:24] <Nicholas> *I* thought that there were only 3 user accounts on this host, but I checked and there are 11. So I claim that it's a 1 in 11 chance that it's me.

[09:08] <jnthn> o/
[09:08] <tellable6> hey jnthn, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/a207c21ebc02885d57d6cfbed6370457
[09:12] <nwc10> \o
[09:23] <jnthn> .tell MasterDuke Well, in RakuAST, make the For statement node be a RakuAST::CheckTime, and implement PERFORM-CHECK, then grab the block, see if it's pointy, grab its signature, and see if its empty (note it'd be done on AST nodes, not meta-objects)
[09:23] <tellable6> jnthn, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[18:52] <nine> dogbert17: so what's it segfaulting on?
[19:09] <dogbert17> I'm trying to figure that out, when compiling with --no-optimize the SEGV gets elusive
[19:10] <dogbert17> perhaps I'm misunderstanding your question
[19:24] <dogbert17> turn on opts again I now I got - MoarVM panic: non-AsyncTask fetched from eventloop active work list
[19:31] <dogbert17> nine: it seems as if the variable test is NULL on line 496
[19:40] <dogbert17> I should also mention that I'm running with a tiny nursery (8k)
