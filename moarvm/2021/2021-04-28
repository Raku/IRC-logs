[04:47] <japhb> timotimo: What are the squiggly lines that look kinda like resistors in the various threads.  Blocked?

[04:49] <japhb> timotimo: Also, what's on CPU1 that triggers every 10ms?

[04:52] <timotimo> i believe that's the tracy frontend gui program

[04:52] <timotimo> and the squigglies are for things that are too small to be visible or i guess multiple things at the same spot at that zoom level

[06:52] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[07:10] <nwc10> I wonder if [email@hidden.address] really still is majordomo

[07:11] <brrt> good * nwc10

[07:29] <nwc10> Yes, it really does still seem to be majordomo.

[16:55] <MasterDuke> timotimo: does perf work for you? i always have to edit my /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid before it works, maybe it's the same for tracy?

[16:55] <timotimo> i just set that to 0 and that didn't help, also setenforce 0

[16:56] <MasterDuke> huh

[17:00] <timotimo> i'll try recompiling nqp
