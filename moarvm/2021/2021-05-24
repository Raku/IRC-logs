[08:00] <MasterDuke> nine: would it be considered bad form to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1497 but squash while doing so?
[08:02] <nine> It's what I'd do

[08:05] <MasterDuke> doh! doing it through github loses the commit messages...
[08:05] <nine> for real?
[08:05] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9fdb381597
[08:05] <nine> GitHub--
[08:06] <MasterDuke> yeah. i assumed it'd either concatenate them all together and/or give me the option of editing it/them
[08:07] <MasterDuke> and after he went to the trouble of adding the longer message...
[08:07] <nine> So...if in doubt, use the command line
[08:07] <MasterDuke> do we care enough to do a revert and re-merge?
[08:07] <nine> no
[08:08] <Nicholas> can you add the lost commit message as a comment in a relevant place?
[08:08] <Nicholas> (sorry, head mostly elsewhere)
[08:09] <MasterDuke> i can do that

[12:10] <MasterDuke> ok, got gmp to build on windows by itself. now to try and get moarvm to use/build it...
[12:33] *** zakharyas joined
[13:43] <MasterDuke> progress. moarvm mostly builds and installs from the configure and makefile. nqp builds, but creating the runner fails. the nqp-m.exe in the nqp directory works though
[13:45] *** dogbert17 left
[13:48] <MasterDuke> oh, that was an easy fix. nqp installs now, but it does fail some tests
[13:50] <MasterDuke> ugh, they do pass on linux, so now to some windows-specific debugging...

[20:09] <japhb> Ah.  I just noted you had op here, so figured you could put in something for the interim.
[20:09] <japhb> The MUGS org is still awaiting approval as well.
[20:10] <@lizmat> here?  ah, you mean on libera?
