[14:57] <@lizmat> this just on HEAD on my local copy of the logs server:
[14:57] <@lizmat> raku(31555,0x700002c7d000) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f98d87cd7c0: pointer being realloc'd was not allocated

[15:28] *** kevin1 joined
[15:31] *** kjp left
[15:33] <Nicholas> So we have to keep talking, to try to recreate the test case? That's what you're saying? :-)
[15:34] <@lizmat> he, no, just noticing there's a gremlin in there still
[15:34] <@lizmat> haven't been able to repro
[15:35] <nine> You probably don't have a core dump?
[15:35] <@lizmat> Nicholas: would you argue that's a typical across thread hash access issue >?
[15:35] <@lizmat> if so, then I'm probably to blame
[15:35] <Nicholas> it's possible, for a large hash
[15:35] <@lizmat> nine: no core dump, no
[15:36] <Nicholas> for a smaller hash, you'd confuse the FSA, which might mess things up in a different way
[15:36] <Nicholas> but it will all end up with undefined behaviour
[15:36] <Nicholas> (and much wailing and gnashing of teeth)
[15:37] <@lizmat> hehe
[15:37] <@lizmat> should I mention these events here or only if I can repro ?

[16:07] <nine> lizmat: please mention them. Maybe someone is working on something related or has seen something related and picks up a further clue that way. We've got channel volume well under control :)

[16:51] <jnthn1> Curious find. /<&foo()>/ compiles into CALL_SUBRULE. /<&foo>/ compiles into INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION. I think this was an accident. But the latter is likely a good bit less efficient.
[16:51] <jnthn1> Fixed in RakuAST (TM)

[18:45] <MasterDuke> i don't know CALL_SUBRULE, but generally i say the fewer calls to INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION the better

[22:57] <moon-child> maybe worthwhile to run under rr in the future, so easier to catch it if it happens again?
