[12:05] <dogbert17> the callframe problem can be made ~100 percent reproducible by running with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[12:10] <dogbert17> here's the test case lifted out from S06-advanced/callframe.t: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/612d401829d5e17129524bc328267db0

[13:09] <dogbert17> trying 'jit-bisect --spesh' several times produces results like 'SPESH Broken frame: 396x' where x varies slightly from run to run

[13:09] <dogbert17> reading the produced spesh logs is above my pay grade :(

[13:17] <sena_kun> dogbert17, is it a new-disp issue or?

[13:17] <dogbert17> new-disp :)

[13:17] <sena_kun> alright

[14:56] <timo> wow we really did concentrate on new-disp didn't we

[14:57] <sena_kun> timo, you mean lower than "usual" commit rates? yes, but it's so for some months already, I think.

[14:59] <timo> doesn't look great

[15:00] <sena_kun> 08, 06, 03... but others are more lively

[15:02] <sena_kun> and yes, new-disp is lively instead, I hope we'll be able to merge it soon (need to find a volunteer to do next release, don't wanna to log 200+ commits or something. :P)

[15:03] <sena_kun> anyway, moarvm one is done, now next one...

[15:37] * sena_kun still awaits news about the fixes

[16:04] <timo> you mean the ecosystem modules that rely on stuff that's no longer valid?

[16:06] <sena_kun> timo, they are fine, but AFAIK we still have modules exposing legit regressions to be fixed within moarvm realm.

[16:07] <timo> oh, okay!

[16:19] <dogbert17> timo: perhaps you can figure out what's going wrong in tS06-advanced/callframe.t
