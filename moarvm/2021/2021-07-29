[00:19] <japhb> MasterDuke, nine: No --full-cleanup involved with panic.  While trying to golf the panic, I found this interesting case:

[00:19] <japhb> $ raku -e 'use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL; EVAL buf8.allocate(100_000).raku'

[00:20] <japhb> Bytecode validation error at offset 52, instruction 10:

[00:20] <japhb> callsite expects 257 more positionals in block <unit> at -e line 1

[00:20] <japhb> Still trying to find what I need to golf the panic.

[00:27] <timo> we might be using an 8bit number somewhere still

[00:29] <japhb> timo: If I drop a digit in the allocate number (to 10_000) it succeeds.  So maybe a 16-bit?  Checking "interesting" numbers ....

[00:30] <japhb> Oooh, 65_535 gives the same error, but 65_534 gives:

[00:30] <japhb> Bytecode validation error at offset 524374, instruction 65551:

[02:21] <japhb> 0

[02:21] <japhb> 1

[02:21] <japhb> MoarVM panic: Tried to garbage-collect a locked mutex

[02:22] <japhb> On my system, hoisting either the EVAL or the load-yaml call out of the loop means it survives.

[08:26] <lizmat> oops  :-)

[08:27] <lizmat> it's just an example of a .chars == 1 and .codes = 4  :-)

[08:30] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/434a6db06998d04e351368d3edaea42f a backtrace from that `MoarVM panic: Tried to garbage-collect a locked mutex` error

[09:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> moarning o/

[09:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: The backtrace won't be terribly useful, alas, 'cus it'll be in the GC, which can be triggered at any time. What may be useful is trying to work out where the mutex was allocated, which may be possible-ish with rr

[09:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> The actual MVMObject isn't useful in itself 'cus it moves every GC, but iirc it points to a piece of malloc'd memory to hold the uv_mutex and you could perhaps do a reverse watch on that

[09:14] <MasterDuke> the ->body.mutex i assume?

[09:15] <Nicholas> \o

[09:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes

[09:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Not the pointer, but some memory location inside of it

[09:38] <dogbert17> Hah, what a fail, tried to to 'zef install YAMLish' on master and was met with 'labeled next without loop construct'

[09:38] <dogbert17> no matter, found a workaround

[09:45] <lizmat> hmmm...  I thought zef had worked around

[09:45] <lizmat> in any case, there's a PR (in MoarVM) by nine that should fix this

[09:48] <dogbert17> lizmat: thx, I got around the problem by setting MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 during the install

[09:49] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: perhaps we could merge nine's PR and bump MoarVM?

[10:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> argh, that's annoying... So I got spesh linking working again. Turns out that since it emits into temporaries while forming the dispatch program and then releases them, and then runbytecode also does this and uses the temps within the lifetime of the other temps, they interfere and then boom segv

[12:20] <MasterDuke> rr does not like if i try to watch inside the `rm->body.mutex`

[15:45] <nine> I.e. the Bytecode validation error happens during prepare_and_verify_static_frame called from instrumentation_level_barrier, i.e. while we're holding that mutex. So we jump out of that instrumentation_level_barrier without ever unlocking

[16:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: oops, thanks

[16:20] <MasterDuke> `Unhandled exception: Internal error: multiple ex_release_mutex` doh

[16:24] <MasterDuke> hm. MVM_load_bytecode does a `MVM_tc_set_ex_release_mutex` before we reach `prepare_and_verify_static_frame`

[16:26] <MasterDuke> make it an array of mutexes?

[16:29] <MasterDuke> in prepare_and_verify_static_frame unlock the one that's already held, set the new one, then re-set the old one if an exception hasn't been thrown?

[16:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> So inlining reenalbed will get through the NQP build and fail one test; the Rakudo build fails the same test. Which...OK let's debug, but WHY does the frame the broken inlining happens in have to be EXPR (the expression parser)? :/

[16:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> Sure I'll go hunt this in 153 basic blocks :P

[16:32] <timo> whew.

[16:32] <timo> maybe it's a phi instruction with more than 65k arguments

[16:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> :P

[16:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> The upper limit of the size of that is surely the number of basic blocks?

[16:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh, it's a deopt bug

[16:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> What on earth is it doing

[16:36] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm suspecting its table of inline extends is rather off

[16:36] <Nicholas> ASAN or valgrind have hints?

[16:36] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: Didn't check, but feels very unlikely; it's almost certainly an off-by-something 

[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> It thinks that it's doing uninlining

[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or rather, that it should

[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> But it really shouldn't

[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> I guess something about the way calls look now means that end of inline marker is mis-placed or similar

[16:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or start

[16:41] <MasterDuke> huh. https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e74be1116ea58d52c7ea218ce02e4547 doesn't fix the panic. even if that patch had some other bad behaviors, i thought it would at least prevent the panic

[16:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> It's a bit odd. I can change the <= to < or make inline end annotations move in the other direction to fix the deopt bug...but doing either of those gets me a different wrong deopt

[16:54] <Nicholas> timo: Well, you never know. it might be "It's faster. Enjoy"

[16:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm now at "why does this work on master" :)

[16:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> We set the end offset of an inline as the location after writing that instruction

[17:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> So the <= is wrong, since it would include the instruction after the inlined one.

[17:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> That'd also suggest we want to move it back, not forward

[17:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> Since it should be the last inlined instruction.

[17:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> oh hang on what

[17:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> We're writing it as a pre instruction

[17:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> I misread

[17:02] <jnthnwrthngtn> That implies it has to be on the instruction after the deopt always

[17:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> Doing that gets me another issue that...doesn't look like a deopt one, just bytecode corruption. Odd.

[18:35] <MasterDuke> no

[18:36] <nine> MasterDuke: with that patch we now no longer unlock the tmp_ex_release_mutex, so maybe that's what gets collected while still locked

[18:36] <MasterDuke> oh. right. hm

[18:37] <MasterDuke> seems like maybe it does have to be an array of ex_release_mutexes?

[18:40] <nine> That would slow things down though

[18:41] <MasterDuke> yeah. my only other idea is passing the mutex down through all the functions calls and unlocking it in fail()

[20:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> So the way to debug inlining deopt bugs is apparently to order and eat a "garlic chicken" curry where they put WHOLE CLOVES of garlic - lots of them - into an already very garlicy sauce :)

[20:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> I didn't try it with stressing yet, but this causes no regressions

[20:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Note, however, that it's inlining very little Raku code so far

[20:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or even spesh linking 

[20:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> 'cus I didn't yet teach it about dispatch programs with resumption state

[20:17] <nine> If that's the way to debug inlining deopt bugs, I do hope there's a couple of those bugs left for me :D

[20:21] <timo> i see a bunch of "inlining prevented by the op callercode" in a random piece of the nqp build speshlogged; isn't that an op that we can reasonably do right with inlining?

[20:25] <Nicholas> I'm getting a massive DU backtrace when I run time perl Configure.pl --backends=moar --prefix=/home/nick/Sandpit/moar-SAN

[21:21] <timo> ohmygosh

[21:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> I ran tests while I was afk, no regressions, so guess it's close

[21:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: Congrats or something..you have the DU checking turned on, I guess?

[21:22] <Nicholas> I had, but I turned them off and I still see it

[21:22] <Nicholas> So I'm cofnused

[21:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> huh

[21:22] <Nicholas> that's what I thought

[21:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> "MoarVM oops in spesh thread: Malformed DU chain: reading goto of 4(2) not in graph" :D

[21:25] <timo> whoops, goto

[21:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, I can guess what silly I've done

[21:26] <timo> changed the info of an ins without freeing usages?

[21:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> I like how much code went away when updating inlining

[21:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> The main thing left to re-instate is the JIT

[21:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Which is probably doing rather little at present

[21:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> Since none(runbytecode, runcfunc, sp_dispatch) are JITted so far

[22:06] <[Coke]> will we ever be able to remove the deprecated ones, or will those gaps always be there?

[22:06] <[Coke]> (And it shouldn't impact anything, right?)

[22:08] <timo> we can fill them back up
