[08:24] <nine> This is getting weirder and weirder: I can give the nested compiler a clone of moar_frames and it's still OK. I can also manually copy all frames from the nested compiler's mast_frames to the outer compiler's after the compilation and it still works!
[08:25] <nine> So the contents of mast_frames is exactly the same as with the original code, both during the nested compilation and after it.
[08:25] <nine> That can only mean that it's not about the contents of the hash. It must be about the reference to the hash itself.
[08:55] *** evalable6 left
[08:55] *** linkable6 left
[08:56] *** linkable6 joined
[08:57] *** evalable6 joined
[08:58] <nine> Indeed. When I put the original mast_frames hash into a different key _and_ store it in an otherwise completely unused attribute in MASTCompilerInstance it breaks.
[09:35] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[09:59] <nine> A simple %!mast_frames := nqp::null; in MASTCompilerInstance's to_mast after the actual compilation fixes the problem. So I think there's enough evidence to conclude that somehow a reference to the MASTCompilerInstance makes it into the compiled bytecode. This will drag in a lot of objects (e.g. every closure and objects they reference).
[10:00] <nine> Still, this doesn't actually explain why compilation results differ. Even if we reference everything in the world, this world should be exactly the same in each case.
[10:05] <nine> Thinking some more about it, it makes even less sense. After all I have already established that it's not about references to pre-existing outer frames, nor about references to inner frames. And it can hardly be about references to outer frames compiled after the nested compiler finishes, because the bytecode will already have been written by then.
[10:05] <nine> Also it's the outer compiler's bytecode that shows the differences.
[11:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> In a threaded program it could be expected that the proxy readers get produced in different orders. Is the reproducible build test involving threads in the code used to test?
[11:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> Though I think you also said only one gets produced, and so there'd not be an ordering question anyway
[11:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> One other thought: I compile a QAST::Block, does it get wrapped for me into a QAST::CompUnit at some point, and if so, does anything in that process cause issues?
[11:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> Those are the only thoughts I've had on it overnight. :)
[11:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yesterday evening I worked on findmethod/tryfindmethod/can all getting switched over to new-disp. findmethod and trymethod go fine; switching can over makes it all the way through the CORE.c.setting build and then mysteriously explodes during setting loading.
[11:41] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: no threads, except for ones triggered by the react/whenever on the Proc::Async in method precompile. But no actual concurrency going on in the test.
[11:43] <nine> Trying to get a better picture of the differences between different compilation runs, I used the strings utility on the bytecode files and looked at the diff between the strings output. It seems like actually the only differences are between those mysterious strings containing only decimal numbers.
[11:43] <nine> That and different offsets, probably just caused by the difference in length of the strings section.
[11:44] <nine> So now I really want to know: what the hell are those numbers?
[11:49] <MasterDuke> pause in gdb/rr and then grep through /proc/<...>/moar ?
[11:50] <MasterDuke> think it might be related to that regression someone (xliff perhaps?) noticed that seems to cause doubled precomp for some things?
[11:51] <nine> Possible. Those may also have been caused by the regression I fixed yesterday. And there's still the occasional reproducible-builds.t failure I've seen on CI that shows differences in check_routine_sanity's bytecode that I have totally failed to debug
[11:53] <nine> Those numbers are part of the serialization context.
[11:59] <nine> Which means that I can at least catch and diagnose them in rr
[12:01] <MasterDuke> are the numbers always the same?
[12:02] *** reportable6 left
[12:02] <nine> No, they are always different which is where the reproducibility issue comes from. But they seem to be always around 1 billion. Sometimes a little smaller, mostly a little larger. But strings containing 9 digit numbers don't seem to appear elsewhere
[12:03] <nine> No, they are always different which is where the reproducibility issue comes from. But they seem to be always around 1 billion. Sometimes a little smaller, mostly a little larger. But strings containing 9 digit numbers don't seem to appear elsewhere
[12:03] *** reportable6 joined
[12:03] <nine> These numbers are hash keys
[12:04] <MasterDuke> pointers perhaps? what else could be that large?
[12:04] <nine> That's exactly what I just thought
[12:04] <nine> Where do we have a hash that is keyed on pointers (or objectids)?
[12:05] <nine> Labels!
[12:07] <MasterDuke> btw, i just pulled all repos up to HEAD and that precomp issue is still there

[12:08] <MasterDuke> from `RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 raku -e 'use Test'`
[12:09] <nine> There's a %!labels lookup hash in MAST::Frame keyed on the nqp::objectid of MAST::Label objects. So the chain probably is: somehow the shared mast_frames hash leads to the MASTCompilerInstance getting references, which pulls in the MAST::Frame objects and this hash and the keys differ thanks to address layout randomization
[12:11] *** Merfont is now known as Kaiepi
[12:11] *** Kaiepi left
[12:11] *** Kaiepi joined
[12:22] <nine> Replacing nqp::objectid for that labels lookup hash with an id counter (like cuid for QAST::Block) fixes the issue
[12:23] <MasterDuke> does it make the precompiled setting bytecode smaller?
[12:23] <nine> No. Because we still reference stuff for no good reason
[12:24] <MasterDuke> ha
[12:24] <MasterDuke> how hard will it be to remove the reference?
[12:27] <nine> Well....usually when the struggle to find a bug is as hard as this one, as soon as you got the first candidate fix, pretty much everything you try just works :D
[12:28] <nine> That's just part of the general hostility and unfairness of the universe I guess :D
[12:28] <nine> Because sadly no one's gonna get that reference. It's from here: https://www.quotes.net/mquote/679153
[12:31] <MasterDuke> never watched babylon 5. will probably give it a try eventually
[12:32] <nine> Good time for it since despite years of claims that it's impossible, an HD remaster came out last winter
[12:38] <MasterDuke> oh, nice. i remember hearing people complain about that, didn't realize one had actually happened
[12:40] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: my only guess is that the MASTCompilerInstance is referenced by a closure. Or maybe a capture? Do you have an idea where to look for those? Or can the newdisp way lead to more such references in general?
[12:41] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: my only guess is that the MASTCompilerInstance is referenced by a closure. Or maybe a capture? Do you have an idea where to look for those? Or can the newdisp way lead to more such references in general?
[12:42] <MasterDuke> looks like i need hbo max to stream the hd version (or purchase from amazon or apple)
[12:47] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: I'm struggling to imagine where that would happen. This is the only place that I'm having new-disp do some code generation.
[12:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: In general, any blocks that are handed back as code to invoke by new-disp are placed at unit level, not inside the dispatcher itself.
[12:55] <MasterDuke> nine: does your fix change anything about that example i pasted above?

[20:21] <timo> if i recall correctly, the branch doesn't actually compile a single program successfully :D
[20:22] <timo> some stuff that everything uses is still missing or so?
[20:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'd probably start from guards and value results
[20:22] <Nicholas> It was all a dream :-(
[20:22] <Nicholas> more pragmatically, is there a workable way to do it, until you rediscover the cool way?
[20:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> And once those are working, add in the invokey bits
[20:23] <nine> If it was just a dream after all, there's no point in being annoyed :)
[20:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> I suspect I'll figure out a decent way to do it :)
[20:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> The code for specializing invocations will get a huge amount simpler
[20:24] *** MasterDuke left
[20:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> Because invoke spec goes away and multi caches go away
[20:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> Inlining code gets simpler because takedispatcher and friends go away
[20:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> my `d` key is going to get some wear :)
[20:29] <timo> https://gist.github.com/timo/eb3a20abba0831d8f598073f44eafcf0 is the diff between the then state of new-disp and the disp-spesh-codegen branch
[20:36] <timo> (now in color)
[20:47] <dogbert17> timo: looks a lot better
[20:48] <timo> amazing what a splash of color can do
[20:48] <dogbert17> but it didn't fix everything though
[20:49] <dogbert17> MoarVM panic: Collectable 0x557051db04a8 in fromspace accessed
[20:50] <dogbert17> the insta-SEGV is still there as well, should be something for Nine :)
[23:17] *** jgaz joined
