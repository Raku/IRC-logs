[07:42] <MasterDuke> ha. i did build a custom watercooling setup about 20 years ago. the silence and cooling was nice, but it made doing any work in the case quite annoying. haven't gone back, but it seems that the pre-built, all-in-one systems you can get now might be nicer

[07:43] <nine> I think Gigabyte mainboards usually have the BIOS flash chip used for storing 2 copies of the BIOS (actually UEFI). An update will only affect one copy and it even automatically switches to the backup version if it fails to boot.

[07:43] <nine> Could be that this is also what it uses when a BIOS setting (like memory frequency) causes the boot to fail. It seems to try 3 times and then give up and come up with the old setting.

[10:49] <timo> i just did a bios update of my t14s today and it said something about "self-healing" being updated, so i assume after it has booted a version of the bios successfully it'll make a backup of that or something
