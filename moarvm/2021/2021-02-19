[21:01] <MasterDuke> my branch calls allocate_frame 470k more times than master

[21:10] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure i trust perf's annotation of MVM_frame_invoke. at least to me, it looks like it's saying there's time spent in the `#if MVM_SPESH_CHECK_PRESELECTION` block, but MVM_SPESH_CHECK_PRESELECTION is *not* set

[21:25] <jnthn> Curious. In the profile output is the inline ratio lower to match that?

[21:27] <MasterDuke> not sure. btw, should i check master with that last decont logging change applied on top? or leave it as is (where it has the 688k deopts, but is still faster)

[21:29] <jnthn> I think let's get that change in sooner

[21:30] <MasterDuke> master (stock): In total, 12746473 call frames were entered and exited by the profiled code. Inlining eliminated the need to create 9760662 call frames (that's 43.37%).

[21:30] <MasterDuke> remove branch: In total, 11604551 call frames were entered and exited by the profiled code. Inlining eliminated the need to create 10902584 call frames (that's 48.44%).

[21:30] *** linkable6 left
[21:31] <jnthn> Wat, that should be less allocate frame calls then

[21:31] *** linkable6 joined
[21:32] <MasterDuke> master (plus decont logging change): In total, 11604381 call frames were entered and exited by the profiled code. Inlining eliminated the need to create 10902754 call frames (that's 48.44%).

[21:33] <MasterDuke> my earlier counts were by just sticking an fprintf in allocate_frame, maybe that's not quite the exact same counting method?

[22:35] <japhb> MasterDuke: Wouldn't the I/O call (the fprintf) affect timings enough to change thread scheduling?

[22:36] <MasterDuke> well, the only threads should be the main one and spesh, and i had MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING set. so possibly, but i tried to minimize it

[22:37] <japhb> Hmmm, fair.

[22:55] <jnthn> Darn it. New Ryzen showed up today. Was just going to stick an OS on it. Turn it out. Very unpleasant scraping sound from one of the fans. :/

[22:55] <jnthn> *Turn it on, even

[22:58] <MasterDuke> an important one? or one you can temporarily leave off?

[22:58] <jnthn> I don't know yet :/

[22:59] <jnthn> Too tired to figure it out right now
