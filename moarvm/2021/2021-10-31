[12:47] <timo> SDL_SetRenderDrawColor($render, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff) ends up compiling to four getspeshslots followed by getting the bigint out of the objects, then passing them as an integer argument. but that's not on the nativecall dispatcher invoke branch, so perhaps it's better there? it's also possible that i didn't do the multi sub correctly such that it decides to take the Int rather than int candidates

[13:10] <MasterDuke> huh. i did a --profile-compile of a smaller version of the script with lots of variables (only 20k) and it reported 120417 deoptimizations, 20002 global deoptimization, and 40854 OSRs

[13:10] <MasterDuke> those numbers seem higher than i would expect

[13:39] <timo> depends on where the deopts happen, of course. but if you have a tight loop that deopts and osr's every time it goes around the loop that could happen

[13:41] <MasterDuke> yeah, looks like compile_all_the_stmts gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:6450 has 20k of the OSRs and 60k of the deopts

[13:46] <timo> that's very funny

[13:46] <dogbert11> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/dogbert/repos/rakudo/t/spec/S06-routine-modifiers/proxy.t

[13:46] <dogbert11> Container spec 'code_pair' must be configured with a fetch

[13:47] <dogbert11> happens when running with a (very) small nursery
