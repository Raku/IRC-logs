[11:04] <Altai-man> nine, hmm, let's say a minus with a minus gives a plus.

[11:07] <Altai-man> one potential way to avoid such blunders is to put the burden on devs and I'd like to avoid that. another is to have a deeper understanding of what's going on which is not a real solution.

[15:14] <Guest74> good game

[15:16] <MasterDuke> doubt i can help, i've never used android

[15:16] <MasterDuke> and yeah, enjoying it

[15:16] <Guest74> have tou met the back guy yet in the game

[16:30] <nine> Altai-man: that's why I pointed it out. As the dev who introduced and fixed the bug I knew that :)

[16:31] <Altai-man> nine, thanks for your attention as always. :)

[16:31] <nine> Thanks for doing the tedious release work!

[16:32] <MasterDuke> oh, ha. Guest 74 and [Coke] had very similar coloring and i didn't even notice it wasn't [Coke] asking if anyone was on

[16:32] <Altai-man> need 3 more releases to break previous record sequence

[16:33] <MasterDuke> timo: i assume they saw 'VM' in the name

[16:33] <MasterDuke> Altai-man++, all release managers++

[16:33] <Altai-man> I'll probably need some rest after the second year though
