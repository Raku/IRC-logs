[06:22] <nine> So, I ran p6-jupyter-kernel/t/05-autocomplete.t in a loop for 16 hours and no more crashes after my spesh stats memory corruption fix :)

[06:23] <Nicholas> and as it's clearly stuck at 0-0, now it goes to penalities?

[06:23] <nine> However, it did run into a deadlock once (out of 10K runs). It got stuck waiting for a semaphore in await while all worker threads were waiting on the task queue: https://gist.github.com/niner/346dbbd64710db9599a33c1f23197afd

[06:23] <nine> I've seen this deadlock before in other programs

[06:24] <nine> Anyway, time to create some PRs with my fixes

[06:36] <MasterDuke> Nicholas: afk until this evening, but did you see my reply about benchmarking your branch?

[06:37] <Nicholas> no, I hadn't

[06:38] <Nicholas> OK, odd. Interesting. If that thing can spin on the mutex there in the new code path, does that mean that it spins on a mutex in the existing places that the existing code calls.

[06:38] <Nicholas> I don't have time to investigate currently.

[06:38] <Nicholas> could you add that one or two line finding as a comment to the PR, so that we don't forget it

[06:39] <Nicholas> (maybe "this evening")

[06:39] <MasterDuke> sure

[06:39] <Nicholas> whatever this "evening" thing is. :-)

[08:27] <Nicholas> I might not get a chance to get back to that stuff for (literally) a couple of months.

[08:27] <Nicholas> I have a backlog of "things that I should have been doing but PSC got in the way"

[08:29] <lizmat> ah, not the RSC  :-)

[08:29] <Nicholas> indeed not. I wonder if there's a QSC

[08:32] <lizmat> Questionable  :-)
