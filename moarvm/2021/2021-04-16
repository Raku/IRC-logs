[06:42] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[07:03] <nine>  Good Friday! (Fridays are a thing on IRC, aren't they?)

[07:04] <nwc10> I believe so. But they seem to come and go.

[07:12] *** patrickb joined
[07:16] <nwc10> patrickb: so we go deeper down the rabbit hole...

[07:16] <patrickb> good * (morning over here) :-)

[07:17] <nwc10> The C library pow() (at least for glibc) is accurate for all powers of 10

[07:17] <nwc10> but attempting to build those powers of 10 with floating point multiplication by the algorithm used in the pow_i OP isn't.

[07:17] <nwc10> sigh

[07:17] <nwc10> and then I found

[07:17] <nwc10> r: say 1e23

[07:17] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 08b449e1a: OUTPUT: «Error while reading '/home/camelia/p6eval-token': Permission denied at /home/camelia/rakudo-j-inst/bin/eval-client.pl line 10.␤»

[07:17] <camelia> ..rakudo-moar 6fdc2b690: OUTPUT: «9.9999999999999992e+22␤»

[07:17] <patrickb> Should I try that on mingw?

[07:17] <nwc10> no, no need

[07:18] <nwc10> because we (er, I) probably need to fix that one first

[07:19] <nwc10> the problem seems to be (have not tested this with a debugger) that 1e23 (and one other) end up as binary that grissu3 can't format. So it falls back to sprintf

[07:19] <nwc10> and we have sprintf with %17g

[07:19] <nwc10> and that's, um, not correct here

[07:19] <nwc10> but likely %15g isn't correct for other values.

[07:20] <nwc10> the soution seems to be to move (it all) to Ryū

[07:21] <nwc10> which has a suitably licensed implentation written in C

[07:21] <nwc10> and then tackle the previous step. Worst case is 309 8-byte values in a lookup table.

[07:22] <nwc10> But that's not for today.

[07:22] <nwc10> I have no coffee. What could possibly go wrong? :-)

[07:23] <patrickb> oh. That sounds like a fair share of pain. I recall how much effort and reading up zoffix once did to arrive at the grissu3 solution we currently have...

[07:23] <patrickb> nwc10: Thank you for championing this. 

[07:25] <nwc10> It's getting worrying - I can look at code that has if (e == 0 and m ==0) { ... } and know what that means just as-is

[07:25] <patrickb> ao

[07:25] <patrickb> ao

[07:26] <patrickb> sorry keyboard switched configs

[07:26] <patrickb> exponent =0 and mantissa = 0 -> it's a zero float?

[07:28] <nine> patrickb: that would e too obvious :)

[07:28] <patrickb> (typo pun :-)

[07:29] <nine> ah I wish that was on purpose :)

[07:35] <nwc10> yes.

[19:15] <MasterDuke> nine: any reason you didn't PR https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/74505ce54d ?

[19:42] <sena_kun> Somewhere between https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ba124ad12875f3f4f85bc2433e92b7a5f0aaa47c and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9481289950b89dabb553e63d277038518c590b92 the App::Uni module was broken, we need to investigate and fix it.

[19:45] <MasterDuke> it's definitely a moarvm-caused problem, not all the unicode-related commits in rakudo between that timespan?

[19:47] <MasterDuke> hm, but there are some string ops commits in there...

[19:48] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, it bisects to the moarvm bump and I checked manually it's indeed the bump.

[19:49] <MasterDuke> oh, but i just cloned it and the tests pass for me

[19:51] <MasterDuke> hm, i wasn't at HEAD everywhere, let me try again...

[19:54] <MasterDuke> yup, still pass

[19:56] <MasterDuke> hm, that blin gist says it's version 1.0.2, but the git clone says 1.0.1...

[19:56] <MasterDuke> oh, but its META6.json does say 1.0.2

[19:58] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: does it fail locally for you?

[20:00] <MasterDuke> also installs fine with zef

[20:08] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: also, the repo description still says "Perl 6 - command-line utility" and the readme says unicode 12, but we're now using 13.1

[20:15] <japhb> [Coke]: Any interest in PRs to merge in some of the functionality from https://gist.github.com/japhb/7b8a68da1b4b6c201e5334c1269b951a  ?

[20:22] *** zakharyas left
[20:54] *** patrickb left
[20:55] <nine> MasterDuke: wait, I didn't?

[20:57] <nine> MasterDuke: oh, I simply forgot after pushing the branch. But... there's more to come on that anyway. I found other places where we missed propagating the facts. Will commit and push those and then create the PR

[20:57] <MasterDuke> cool
