[07:11] <Nicholas> nine: this "evening" thing is a myth? At least, it's not useful for progress with coding?

[07:16] <MasterDuke> nine: dogbert11's segv in io-cathandle.t just reprod for me in the second run

[07:18] <MasterDuke> took a couple more tries to get it in gdb, but just did

[07:18] <MasterDuke> list

[07:19] <MasterDuke> `tc=0x798912`, that's not right...

[07:19] <nine> So...what am I doing wrong? I am up to date on new-disp in all 3 repos, set GC_DEBUG to 1 and MVM_NURSERY_SIZE to 16 * 1024 and did a debug build.

[07:19] <nine> Running: while MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 gdb --ex 'set confirm' --ex run --ex quit --args /home/nine/rakudo/install/bin/moar --execname=/home/nine/rakudo/rakudo-m --libpath=/home/nine/rakudo --libpath=/home/nine/rakudo/blib --libpath=/home/nine/rakudo/install/share/nqp/lib /home/nine/rakudo/rakudo.moarvm -Ilib t/spec/S32-io/io-cathandle.t ; do true ; done

[07:20] <MasterDuke> have you tried compiling with clang instead of gcc?

[07:21] <nine> No. How do I do that?

[07:21] <MasterDuke> oh, i didn't have MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING set

[07:22] <MasterDuke> --compiler=clang added to MoarVM's configure

[07:24] <MasterDuke> i built with gcc (like i usually do), but sometimes that's made a difference

[07:27] <nine> Oooooh...indeed, without MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING it took only a few tries! MasterDuke++

[07:30] <nine> So we have a corrupted inline cache entry that goes away with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING

[08:00] <MasterDuke> are you also running a spectest in the background? i find that usually helps trigger things

[08:00] *** tealecloud joined
[08:01] * dogbert11 thought the word rr was a surefire way to wake up timo :)

[08:02] <Nicholas> Maybe he needs to set his IRC client to "trigger" on it. I think that ilmari set his to also trigger on "lunch"

[08:02] <timo> i am awake

[08:03] <Nicholas> good UGT, timo

[08:03] <timo> greetings nicholas san

[08:18] <nine> Oooh... that assertion failure is due to a GC issue in MVM_spesh_deopt_one

[08:19] <nine> It's a rather old bug, but the assertion is new, so it only surfaced now

[09:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> morning o/

[09:39] <Nicholas> \o

[09:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Curious. On my walk to work I saw what looked like a relatively low-flying commercial aeroplane with 2 presumably military planes escorting it, one each side.

[09:42] <nine> Most interceptions are due to communications problems

[09:42] <nine> i.e. radio issues

[09:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hopefully nothing more serious than that. Or a training exercise. It's not a path I see flights on often (pretty much flying south along the river)

[10:25] <nine> MasterDuke: can you still reproduce the segfault after my latest commit? Because I do not seem to be able to.

[10:25] <nine> dogbert11: ^^^

[10:28] *** rakuUser joined
[11:52] <dogbert11> nine: I'll test it ...

[11:59] <dogbert11> preliminary results are very promising :)

[12:02] *** reportable6 left
[12:05] *** reportable6 joined
[12:07] <dogbert11> nine: I'm unable to reproduce the SEGV after your change :)

[12:27] <nine> yeah!

[12:27] <dogbert11> but now I'm out of bugs 

[12:28] <dogbert11> a shocking development :)

[12:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> o.O

[12:42] <Nicholas> I'm sure you'll wake up (in the morning) and find that it was all a dream. And you have plenty of bugs for company.

[13:12] <timo> the spesh linking we could get back once the resumption search stuff works for inlines, is that the thing that lets us preselect a spesh candidate by index for invocation? for cases where we cant inline because of non inlinable instructions or size or whatever?

[13:12] <nine> timo: that's what I figured

[13:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes

[13:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> And thus an inlining pre-req

[13:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, that's a lie. 

[13:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> We also try to inline even if that's not true :)

[13:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> If the unspesh'd bytecode looks small enough to have a go

[13:13] <nine> dogbert11: luckily I still have the t/spec/S17-promise/start.t around for such occasions. And as that one's stubborningly refusing to reproduce in rr, it may keep me busy for a while yet

[13:14] <nine> It often shows as "MoarVM oops: MVM_str_hash_lvalue_fetch_nocheck called concurrently on the same hash" but sometimes as a segfault.

[13:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: If you want to figure out the final failing spectest, I wouldn't be sad ;)

[13:57] <dogbert11> nine: I can repro the t/spec/S17-promise/start.t quite consistently with a cut down version of the test file plus MVM_GC_DEBUG=1 and a 48k nursery

[13:58] <nine> dogbert11: Cool! So what's the golf?

[13:59] <dogbert11> https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/77beccab7a3b31555a1381aca322e5fa

[14:04] <dogbert11> btw, I do not use MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 only MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1

[14:10] <nine> Oooh! S17-promise/start.t is sensitive to the !rebuild_table issue, the fix for which is in master, but not yet in new-disp.

[14:14] <dogbert11> nine: have you already solved the mystery?

[14:15] <nine> That remains to be seen. Rebasing everything on master to get those fixes and will then run the test again.

[14:16] <dogbert11> "Alas poor bug! I knew it well"

[14:21] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: somewhere in the AUTOTHREAD business the slash argument to !match-nth loses its container

[14:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Curious. I wonder why that only happens on new-disp.

[14:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> I don't think AUTOTHREAD itself changed

[14:25] <nine> It didn't according to the git history

[14:26] <nine> I added nqp::iscont checks to all involved Str methods and get this: https://gist.github.com/niner/588e0291e1b69c85df06111580515d89

[14:27] <nine> In !match-cursor we're still good. !match-nth occurs multiple times in the backtrace (presumably because of the autothreading) and fails

[14:27] <nine> dogbert11: looks good so far!

[14:27] *** frost left
[14:30] <dogbert11> yay

[14:42] <nine> I've tried to reproduce any issue with nursery sizes of 4, 8, 12 and 16K with multiple runs in parallel, but so far start.t has been perfectly stable.

[14:43] <dogbert11> so it turned out to be a bug you had already fixed

[14:45] <nine> No. It turns out to be a bug MasterDuke++ has already fixed :)

[14:45] <nine> Well, MasterDuke et. al.

[14:46] <dogbert11> MasterDuke et. al. ++

[14:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> .oO( that al guy is terribly productive, shows up everywhere... )

[14:55] <nine> So, AUTOTHREAD is first called with a containerized Junction as argument 1, then 4 layers deeper again with an uncontainerized Match object

[14:55] <dogbert11> m: "aa" ~~ m:nth(1|2)/a/; "aa" ~~ m:nth(1^2)/a/;

[14:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: ( no output )

[15:00] <nine> On master however, it's only called once - and with an uncontainerized Regex argument instead

[15:20] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: there's an importent difference to master that hits closer to home: master picks the match(Regex:D $pattern, :$nth!, *%_) candidate, which does make sense for m:nth(1^2) while new-disp picks the method match(Regex:D $pattern, *%_) candidate with %_ containing: Hash element = {:nth(one(1, 2))} according to dd

[15:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ohhh.

[15:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Then it's relying on the implementation accident mentioned in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bdd1fae0d0500ae77840b9b2a4118d4cbbe90474

[15:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> Note the type of :$nth is Any, not Mu

[15:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> But still, I'd expect the *%_ candidate (the more general one that handles many adverbs) to work

[15:25] <nine> But...shouldn't it then call match(Regex:D $pattern, :$nth!, *%_) with the individual Junction values?

[15:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> Only if we want to reinstate the difference between positionals and nameds

[15:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> The candidate with *%_ slurping them up is a matching candidate

[15:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> m: multi m($a) { 1 }; multi m(*@s) { 2 }; say m(1&2)

[15:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[15:27] <nine> When I remove the $nth! candidate on master to force it to go through the general one, I get the exact same error

[15:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> m: multi m(:$a) { 1 }; multi m(*%s) { 2 }; say m(a => 1&2)

[15:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: OUTPUT: «all(1, 1)␤»

[15:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> On new-disp, that second eval would also output 2

[15:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> m: "aa" ~~ m:i:nth(1|2)/a/; "aa" ~~ m:i:nth(1^2)/a/;

[15:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: ( no output )

[15:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> m: "aa" ~~ m:p(0):nth(1|2)/a/; "aa" ~~ m:p(0):nth(1^2)/a/;

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: OUTPUT: «Cannot modify an immutable Match (｢a｣)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Aha! Le bug on master.

[15:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> Can be exposed without even removing a candidate, just with using multiple adverbs and giving one a junction

[15:30] <lizmat> I guess /me will have a look at that then?

[15:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> Unless nine is already at a soluiton :)

[15:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm guessing it fails to bind/propagate $/

[15:32] <nine> Isn't $/ that uncontainerized Match object?

[15:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> Dunno, I thought it was binding $/ to the caller's $/ in various places

[15:36] <nine> It seems to be passing $/ down (as argument \slash) and at some point assign into slash. So when I see a Match object in slash I figure $/ was deconted along the way

[15:36] <lizmat> nine: that was the idea I think, yes

[15:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> At startup a huge amount of time (25%) is spent doing deserialization of meta-objects (which we do lazily, on first request). It turns out that deserializing the meta-object of Perl6::Grammar results in the allocation of now less than 279855 objects.

[15:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> *no less

[15:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> 1) Holy shit! 2) It seems I know where to look to win some startup performance back. :)

[15:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> However, presumably we're doing this on master also

[15:51] <nine> Wait a minute.... When passing a Junction like 1^2 as :nth to .match, what we essentially expect as result is a Junction of Match objects, right? .match also implicitly sets $/ to _the_ Match object. But, this time we get multiple. That's why $/ contains that Junction. But how is this supposed to work? Who would create those containers to assign into?

[15:53] <nine> We'd basically need a Junction of containers for the assignment to work. But there are no containers in m:nth(1^2)

[16:16] <nine> m: "ab".match(:nth(1^2), /\w/); dd $/

[16:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57841911f: OUTPUT: «Nil $/ = Nil␤»

[20:41] <nine> Because the autothreading trouble only starts if $/ is a Junction already before the call

[20:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, maybe it's because if it's a Junction it auto-threads it

[20:42] <jnthnwrthngtn> Rather than passing along a Scalar that we can assign into?

[20:42] <nine> exactly

[20:42] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hm, but `Mu \slash` looks like it'd not do that

[20:42] <jnthnwrthngtn> Maybe that's forgotten somewhere?

[20:43] <MasterDuke> jnthnwrthngtn: think that most recent commit will help the leaks in `raku --full-cleanup -e ''` on new-disp?

[20:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: Unlikely; it just eliminates wastage, but I think dispatch program cleanup should be freeing all of those

[20:44] <MasterDuke> ok

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: Make some tiny GC functions static inlines

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: These are not inlined, at least not by all C compilers; they are tiny,

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: and the calling cost is about as many cycles as they perform. Another

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 5 million cycles off Rakudo startup, and one of these three is called

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: regularly throughout program execution, so there'll be savings beyond

[20:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: startup too.

[20:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> It's interesting to learn what C compilers ain't inlining.

[20:58] <nine> It's because there are actually 2 Junctions!

[20:58] <nine> The first Junction is in $/ and the second one in the :nth argument

[20:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> These would all be more impressive ratio wise if I did them after the more difficult improvements :)

[20:59] <[Coke]> nine++

[20:59] <nine> It's probably the second Junction that triggers the autothreading and then the autothreading does not distinguish between Mu and Any args

[21:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> No, it blindly expands junctions, and in the case of multiple dispatch, that's kinda all it can do

[21:01] <nine> In this case it's not actually multiple dispatch

[21:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> I guess we could say that if you want to control it over multis you'd stick the constraints on the proto

[21:04] *** reportable6 joined
[21:36] <nine> So, I have a fix, but it somehow turns dd 42.any; into an infinite recursion

[21:39] <[Coke]> O_o;

[21:50] <MasterDuke> huh. https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/07eaac7a76b2f8615bb86ef898dda43c still results in the same `MoarVM panic: Tried to garbage-collect a locked mutex`

[21:51] <MasterDuke> and the backtraces look the same
