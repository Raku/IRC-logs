[20:06] <timo> ahaha :D

[20:13] <timo> i wonder if support for the dispatcher-related stackframe bits would be good to have right now in the debugserver

[20:20] <timo> it feels kind of not so great that when outputting the spesh log for an empty-ish program i get a billion invocations in the stats for frames from Exception.pm6

[20:20] <timo> that's just the class bodies for the exception classes

[20:21] <timo> i seem to recall this is something that rakuast can improve?

[20:26] <timo> oh, sp_dispatch_o completely bailed jitting a frame, that means in theory adding that to the jit could make something somewhere faster and it should be easy to do so i've got something to occupy my time yay

[20:28] <timo> why on earth is ack giving me results from a .o file

[20:31] <timo> huh that's a lot of code, eh

[20:44] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[20:48] <timo> there'll also want to be some handling for var-args ops perhaps

[21:03] <timo> not being able to "make install" is kind of annoying, since ./rakudo-gdb-m doesn't seem to be very happy

[22:53] <timo> i assume when we're left with an sp_dispatch_* we're already in a low performance situation anyway

[22:53] <timo> my brain is kind of feeling a little noodly

[22:58] <timo> tbh i don't even know what kind of code to run to test stuff :D

[23:00] <timo> No resumable dispatch in dynamic scope

[23:00] <timo>    at SETTING::src/core.c/Mu.pm6:647  (/home/timo/raku/rakudo/blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm:Str)

[23:00] <timo>  from gen/moar/World.nqp:3023  (/home/timo/raku/rakudo/blib/Perl6/World.moarvm:add_constant)

[23:00] <timo> well, that looks kinda funny? (this is when trying to run json_fast's Fast.pm6

[23:00] <timo> or rather compiling i guess)

[23:05] <timo> 30% interp_run, 12.6% disp_program_run :D

[23:16] <timo> something seems to be seriously wrong with spesh, or with the spesh log ?!?

[23:17] <timo> there's barely anything in it? in terms of being speshed?

[23:17] <timo> the filename of my script doesn't appear once, so no functions or frames from in there

[23:17] <japhb> timo: If you're trying to use it with new-disp, that's because (as jnthnwrthngtn said) spesh doesn't understand much of new-disp yet.

[23:18] <japhb> And there's no inlining yet either

[23:18] <timo> ok, but this is almost nothing?

[23:18] <timo> that's wild

[23:18] <japhb> *shrug*

[23:19] <japhb> He says it's currently running about half speed even so.

[23:19] <timo> OK fair enough

[23:21] <timo> perhaps it was a little too much hubris to just jump in the code and think i can contribute something without asking around first

[23:30] <japhb> timo: I think he said he's going to have time next week to work on it, so he may get it to the point that you can contribute (I'd ask, at least)

[23:33] <timo> right
