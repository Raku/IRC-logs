[09:59] <MasterDuke> looks like libuv 1.42.0 was released in july. at a very quick skim, didn't notice anything in the changelog that looked relevant to any open issues moarvm has
[10:07] <lizmat> still... would be good to update, no ?
[10:07] <MasterDuke> and libatomic_ops 7.6.12 (we're at 7.6.2) was released in september

[10:17] <Nicholas> \o
[10:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> (good to update) there's always the small risk of a breakage from an upgrade too, although with libuv that has been quite rare
[10:21] <MasterDuke> yes. especially since there doesn't appear to be anything immediately needed and we still have a bunch of new-disp related fixes/changes lined up, i'd sort of lean toward waiting until after the next release

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> So, I guess my challenge now is to work out how to eliminate the thunked flag without breaking the CI :)
[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> (Since my solution to unbust finalizer calls was to not call them when we thunked.)
[10:56] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: what does the thunked flag actually mean?
[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: It was intended as a stopgap while stack unwinding was spread between remove_one_frame and the new callstack mechanism.
[10:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Setting it would suppress additional actions (such as running special return handlers) in remove_one_frame in the event that something new was invoked as part of the unwind
[10:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> Now there pretty much aren't any such actions.

[11:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> This step should be totally innocent, but given I've only got CI to guide me, this is going to be very slow and steady.
[11:10] <nine> Do you have an idea why not running finalizers if thunked is set fixes the problems?
[11:10] <MasterDuke> i wonder if it's possible to get something like a docker image of their CI environments so one can try to replicate locally? it wouldn't necessarily help if it's hardware related, but might if it was some other environmental thing
[11:10] <nine> Yesterday I've yet again tried to reproduce by slowing down my system during the test run. Nothing at all.
[11:11] <MasterDuke> how did you try? running another spectest in the background? i've found that frequently helps
[11:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Not really.
[11:13] <nine> Multiple TEST_JOBS=80 spectests in the background. Pro tip: when trying this, keep one of them in focus so you can ctrl+c when the system starts swapping heavily. On my first try I simply rebooted after half an hour.
[11:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> About the CI: the crash mentions CompUnit. Could it be that the CI has a clean(er) state (e.g. nothing installed) and so takes a different path there, which triggers the bug?
[11:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> It's still really odd that this is the *only* thing that seems to trigger it, though
[11:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> sena_kun++ also suggested to see if Azure has a debug mode thing like Travis, which I'd not thought of
[11:16] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-ssh maybe
[11:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think it'd have to be an Azure thing?
[11:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Since iiuc we run the CI using that, not GitHub actions
[11:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Though knowing it is possible with GitHub actions is useful in general :)
[11:18] <MasterDuke> but i think actions are just a wrapper around azure?
[11:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, but I mean, I think to use actions from the GitHub marketplace we'd have to have our CI pipelines specified in terms of GitHub actions overall, not as an azure pipeline?
[11:20] <MasterDuke> could be
[11:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> Looks like that first step is going to be innocent
[11:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> Alerady have two more lined up
[11:25] <MasterDuke> i wonder how locked down their images are? i.e., could you just set up a reverse shell back to your machine?
[11:26] <MasterDuke> probably not allowed (or very safe)
[11:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, it seems that the CI is based on an ubuntu base image (even named in our azure-pipelines.yaml), so I could try to recreate it that way

[12:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> This is the big one, I guess.
[12:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> I need lunch... :)
[12:13] <MasterDuke> a couple `make m-test` runs have been fine, but i do see a fail in t/spec/S16-unfiled/getpeername.rakudo.moar
[12:14] <MasterDuke> and t/spec/S17-supply/syntax-nonblocking-await.t
[12:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> The latter was mentioned as an issue on master anyway
[12:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> The first is curious.
[12:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Is it failing repeatably?
[12:17] <MasterDuke> ubsan throws a fit when building nqp. `src/6model/serialization.c:1691:21: runtime error: left shift of 4243 by 52 places cannot be represented in type 'long int'` seems like it could be a problem. a *ton* of `runtime error: member access within misaligned address` and `runtime error: load of misaligned address`
[12:18] <MasterDuke> well, the spectest is still running. rakudo definitely feels slower than i remember on this computer
[12:19] <MasterDuke> `src/6model/serialization.c:902:5: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null`
[12:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> Those are interesting, although surely unrelated to this branch
[12:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think if you're running it with UBSAN it's going to feel slower? :)
[12:22] <MasterDuke> oops, yeah, those are completely unrelated to new-special-return testing
[12:22] <MasterDuke> those were from my desktop
[12:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> The shift things maybe don't matter a lot but the null one is a bit concerning
[12:23] <MasterDuke> on the laptop, those two fails aren't happening when run by themselves. t/spec/S16-unfiled/getpeername.rakudo.moar is essentially empty
[12:24] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i don't think any of those usban things are new with new-disp, pretty sure i remember seeing them a while ago
[12:25] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1431
[12:26] <nine> The null pointer thing looks quite trivial. I bet it's when writer->root.num_repos is 0, i.e. there are no repossessions and we didn't allocate a repossession table at all.

[15:42] <nine> Nicholas: we all are :)
[15:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> My best guess remains that it's related to a code-path in comp unit handling that is taken on the CI but not locally for...whatever reason.

[20:24] <Nicholas> nine: OK, first SEGV is at b7d40359a1503dda41e8592297d305ea7b1f2ba5 - as best I can tell you can't pass a NULL ffi_type *rtype to ffi_prep_cif

[20:56] <nine> Nicholas: but I don't see how that commit could cause that? We're passing body->ffi_ret_type there, which is set during setup of the native callsite. And that setup hasn't changed at all
[20:57] <Nicholas> me neither yet. I have a third build in progress - libfii on master
[20:58] <Nicholas> but this really was "that commit should work because it didn't change the dyncall/ffi specific code, but I'll just check it anyway"
[20:58] <Nicholas> "yet" might be "I've gone to bed"
[20:58] <Nicholas> valgrind did not show any problems prior to a NULL pointer deference
[20:59] <timo> running rakudo -e '' while printing out what ops are most commonly validated showed getcode at 51.6k, push_o at 25.6k, 13.9k const_s, 13.5k capturelex, 10.8k set
[20:59] *** patrickz left
[21:01] <timo> adding a tiny fastpath for getcode that validates the two operands without going through the op info's arguments arrays in a loop
[21:01] <timo> gave the first improvement, the 99.75%
[21:02] <timo> putting the operands in there as constants got it down to 99.66%
[21:05] <timo> ideally someone would put a bit of work into an attempt to SIMD the validator as much as that would be possible
[21:05] <Nicholas> nine: I might still randomly vanish into bed, but rr on that commit shows that we hit copy_to in src/6model/reprs/NativeCall.c
[21:06] <Nicholas> and that looks suspiciously like it can't copy enough
[21:11] <nine> Nicholas: ah, yes, of course. I think I've already fixed 5 different things that copy_to neglected to copy
[21:12] <timo> imagine if we could read something about the number of arguments a code has from its opcode ...
[21:15] <nine> timo: the 16 bits ought to give us enough room to encode that.
[21:15] <timo> aye, we "only" have 943 opcodes
[21:15] <timo> but yeah tossing out extops will give us all ze bits
[21:15] <timo> do we split it in half at the moment for extops?
[21:16] <timo> ah, the ext op base is 1024
[21:16] <nine> And the argument count can be part of the op's id. So we only need enough bits for the distinct ops with a certain argument number
[21:16] <MasterDuke> would rakuast make it possible to have built-in support for something like `multi foo(either(Int $a, Str $b)) { ... }` instead of `multi foo(Int $a, Str $b) { ... }; multi foo(Str $a, Int $b) { ... }`?
[21:16] <timo> that's right. i'll want to count that up real quick
[21:17] <timo>     360     2,
[21:17] <timo>     210     3,
[21:17] <timo>     116     1,
[21:17] <timo>      80     4,
[21:17] <timo>      35     5,
[21:17] <timo>      11     6,
[21:17] <timo>       9     0,
[21:17] <timo>       5     7,
[21:17] <timo>       4     8,
[21:17] <timo>       1     2
[21:18] <timo>       1     2
[21:18] <timo>       1 0,
[21:18] <nine> So 9 bits leaves plenty of room for new ops with 2 operands. Does the count include deprecated ones?
[21:19] <timo> like 72 deprecated ops are in there with different numbers of operands
[21:20] <timo> very very many of them are 2 args
[21:20] <timo> only 36 of them
[21:20] <nine> Anyway 4 bits for argument count seems to be plenty enough.
[21:21] <timo> so not getting below 256 for 2-op ops
[21:21] <timo> but, if we turn for example all the trigonometry ops into syscalls
[21:22] <timo> also just like 9 of them are obviously rare enough for that purpose
[21:22] <nine> I thought syscalls are more something for rarely used ops?
[21:24] <timo> copy_f, append_f, rename_f, chmod_f, exists_f, mkdir, open_dir, read_dir, trunc_fh, those are all 2-op ops that may be rare enough for this purpose
[21:24] <timo> in jitted code the cost difference between a syscall and an op should be equal, just more space used in the .moarvm bytecode file
[21:25] <timo> if we can make bytecode validation simpler/faster by tossing a few of the rarest ops, that could be a thing we may do
[21:31] <timo> m: say 177237634 * 100 / 2717440206
[21:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: OUTPUT: «6.52222755845␤»
[21:32] <timo> the total Ir count as reported by callgrind; this is the sum of three runs of rakudo -e ''
[21:32] <timo> for the entire validate_static_frame function
