[09:01] <MasterDuke> morning (and odd, i don't see the channel topic at the top anymore)

[09:42] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[09:42] <Nicholas> good brrt, *

[09:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> .oO( Things you wish you didn't have to learn at all )

[10:11] * brrt wonders what the limitation there really is

[10:12] <Nicholas> I have no idea. Stackoverlow wasn't telling me.

[11:02] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: It isn't actually being put in the include paths for NQP/Rakudo, and if

[11:02] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: you do add it, it causes problems with the libuv include.

[15:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: Nope

[16:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hm, doesn't happen here even though my build is --debug=3

[16:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> I guess you have something else enabled

[16:25] <Nicholas> assertions!

[16:26] <Nicholas> MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 MVM_SPESH_CHECK_DU=1 MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1

[16:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> --debug=3 doesn't enable assertions?

[16:28] <Nicholas> er, I don't know

[18:22] <nine> dogbert17: what would I have to do to reproduce?

[18:33] <dogbert17> nine: checkout the module p6-jupyter-kernel and apply the MoarVM changes that I have added to the bottom of the above gist. Then run 'perl6-gdb-m -Ilib t/05-autocomplete.t'

[18:33] <dogbert17> as many times as are needed for the bug to appear

[18:34] <dogbert17> I can say that I have managed to reproduce it several times already

[18:42] <dogbert17> one day we should do a blin run with some/all of these options applied

[23:22] <[Coke]> I know we talk about booze in here occasionally. I found a thing at Target (local superstore): alcohol freeze pops.
