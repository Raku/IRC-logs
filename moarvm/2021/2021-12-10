[09:56] <lizmat> well, so much for automatic recovery of IRC server connectivity  :-(

[10:05] <nine> Coding issue or just another failure mode that's not yet covered?

[10:25] <lizmat> good question

[10:25] <lizmat> the only thing I can think of, is that it hung in the socket.close

[10:26] * lizmat adds back some verbosity in the code

[10:27] <lizmat> I wonder how this applies to people coming from other languages than English: https://twitter.com/Quux_NL/status/1469026520639459330/photo/1

[10:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> I can vouch for the "What the British mean" column :P

[10:42] <lizmat> now I know why "booster" is spelled "borcestershire" in english  :-)

[10:47] <Nicholas> I knew how to pronnounce the place name Loughborough, but until I read something else on Wikipedia, I didn't realise that pronnunciation of the two "ough"s is different. In the same word.

[10:48] <timo> "laugh, brah"?

[10:48] <lizmat> maybe "slow" vs "slough" ?

[10:50] <timo> that's not like "slouch", is it?

[10:56] <lizmat> nope

[12:10] <[Coke]> sounds like sluff, if I recall correctly

[12:11] <[Coke]> (english is the worst)

[12:14] <[Coke]> (language confusion) - "I am sorry about the confusion here" | "I'm sorry you were confused" | "I'm sorry I was confused"

[12:15] <[Coke]> I must be 1/4 british on my mom's side.

[12:16] <lizmat> :-)

[14:56] <timo> wow how did that get in there

[14:56] <timo> also, why doesn't it tell us what went in there

[14:57] <lizmat> it was a thinko on my part, but still...

[15:40] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[15:41] <lizmat> ok, Geth and the loggers should now really be more resilient to outages

[15:41] <lizmat> timo: I think it was feeding a Channel from multiple threads unbounded

[15:42] <timo> but Channel is threadsafe tho?

[15:45] <lizmat> I'd say so ?

[15:46] <timo> was that unrelated to the panic?

[15:46] <lizmat> the same code snafu also created segfaults and improper number of arg errors on calls

[15:46] <lizmat> so it was definitely messing up things badly

[15:50] <timo> oof

[16:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> "non-AsyncTask fetched from eventloop active work list" whiffs of memory corruption or GC mess-up
