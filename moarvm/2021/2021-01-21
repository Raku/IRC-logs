[10:45] <MasterDuke> jnthn: immediately after this line https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/plan.c#L317 here i added `plan_for_deopt(tc, plan, (MVMStaticFrame *)sf);`, where plan_for_deopt looks through the static frame for any candidate with a num_deopts > 100 and if it finds one, calls add_planned. would it be a problem if the same sf is added to

[10:45] <MasterDuke> the plan by both plan_for_sf and plan_for_deopt?

[10:53] *** zakharyas left
[11:00] <jnthn> I don't think so, in so far as I think we already can plan multiple things for a single sf anyway

[11:02] <MasterDuke> ok, good, that keeps thing simpler. (though now i have to come up with another theory of what's going wrong)

[12:41] <MasterDuke> this seems to be a logic error, because gc_debug, etc don't change anything. https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/fd2360d357bfc85e7dfba607aad7722f has the current diff (this is after MVMSpeshCandidate has been converted to a repr). the logic is now that deopt.c logs every time a frame is deopted, stats.c increments the counter in the spesh

[12:41] <MasterDuke> candidate, plan.c add a new planned kind to the spesh plan if an updated static frame has a spesh candidate with a count > 100, worker.c calls the new MVM_spesh_candidate_discard_one if it sees the new planned kind

[12:45] <MasterDuke> and i'm getting `MoarVM panic: Spesh arg guard: expected 1 candidate but got 2` from the MVM_spesh_arg_guard_regenerate call in MVM_spesh_candidate_add (which i haven't changed any logic of, except to use the new layer of indirection between the spesh body and the candidate list + arg guards

[13:21] <jnthn> Do you only get it if you discard a candidate?

[13:23] *** MasterDuke joined
[13:25] <MasterDuke> jnthn: not sure exactly what you mean, but i get the same error if i stick a `return` right at the top of MVM_spesh_candidate_discard_one

[13:26] <jnthn> OK, what's the minimal addition that causes it? Adding to the plan, for example?

[13:26] <jnthn> Hmm, perhaps the error could occur if you have non-unique entries in sf_updated

[13:27] <jnthn> Make sure that isn't happening also

[13:27] <jnthn> Meeting, bbiab

[13:27] <MasterDuke> hm, same error if i comment out the call to add_planned in plan_for_deopt

[13:28] <MasterDuke> oh, you don't mean just non-unique frames, but frame+candidate?

[13:32] <MasterDuke> because yeah, there are duplicated static frames

[13:36] <MasterDuke> so i should be doing something different here? https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/fd2360d357bfc85e7dfba607aad7722f#file-deopt-patch-L986

[14:05] <MasterDuke> changing that if + increment + push to just the increment gets a lot farther

[14:06] <MasterDuke> now there's a segfault much later, with an unhelpful backtrace

[14:11] <MasterDuke> in MVM_string_check_arg, 0xEDF6 is not within a mapped region. in 2021 you'd have think we've mapped everywhere...

[14:23] <MasterDuke> well, there was a PEBKAC. i was incrementing the spesh candidate's deopt_count, but adding it to the plan if it's num_deopt was > 100

[14:24] <MasterDuke> fixing that gets further into the nqp build, but now there's another segfault with a different unhelpful backtrace...
