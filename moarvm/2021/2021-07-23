[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Don't include deprecated ops in genned libs

[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This was intended to be done in the original commit

[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 03304a37eaaa8b7577a31a7ca81be6ec2babd10d, but a typo meant it wasn't

[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: actually happening. However, just correcting the typo causes problems

[10:32] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: in the NQP build (some bad interaction between offsets, offset values,

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: and reading bytecode). So instead move that filtering to after offsets

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: and values are calculated.

[12:03] <sena_kun> Can I bump the new-disp branch?

[12:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> sena_kun: You mean update MOAR_REVISION and NQP_REVISION files (so you can do a blin run)?

[12:08] <sena_kun> yes

[12:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, fine by me :+1:

[12:15] <MasterDuke> jnthnwrthngtn: i was just reminded of this a couple days ago when i saw some spesh candidate-related new-disp commits, but when you have some time for a review, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1426 could use a final once over

[13:00] * sena_kun starts Blin for new-disp
