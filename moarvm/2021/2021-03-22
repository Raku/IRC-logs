[11:15] <jnthn> moarning o/

[11:16] <nwc10> aye \o

[11:16] <MasterDuke> ahoy

[11:34] <brrt> \o

[11:34] <tellable6> 2021-03-19T19:19:00Z #moarvm <nwc10> brrt well, obvious step 0 is "make tea" but step 1 is where I'm stuck.

[11:34] <tellable6> hey brrt, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/3e5cb1d6904e3ce7fd0811ca3ea9f25a

[11:34] <brrt> nwc10: they *are* out of date

[11:34] <nwc10> o/

[11:35] <nwc10> anyway, as you can "See" (but not really, thanks to not-a-Geth) I figured it out

[11:35] <nwc10> the answer was mov64

[11:35] <brrt> ah

[11:35] <nwc10> but it's all rather out of date, sufficient that "if I were you sir, I wouldn't start frmo here"

[11:36] <brrt> (I need to get lunch)

[11:36] <nwc10> as in, I don't know enough to know whether it's easier to fix all the individual problems in the docs, or start again because the world has moved so far

[11:36] <brrt> yeah, agreed

[11:36] <nwc10> this is important - go eat

[18:07] <japhb> lizmat: My name is misspelled in RWN.  :-(  It's 'Geoffrey', the British spelling.

[18:08] <lizmat> argh

[18:09] <lizmat> fixed, sorry for the confusion... I guess we don't see you enough around here anymore  :-)

[18:09] *** domidumont left
[18:19] <japhb> Awww, now I feel bad.

[18:20] <japhb> FWIW, I am around -- I backlog both #moarvm and #raku-dev daily -- but most of my energy either went to $day-job or MUGS now.

[18:23] <jnthn> That's one more than I backlog :)

[18:23] *** sena_kun left
[18:24] <japhb> jnthn: What about #cro?  I guess we both backlog that one, it's just got very bursty traffic.

[18:25] <jnthn> Yeah, I backlog that too, but it's a quite short job :)

[18:25] <jnthn> Even the bursts aren't that bursty

[18:25] <japhb> True

[18:26] *** sena_kun joined
[18:28] <nwc10> jnthn: you seem to be stalking the Rakudo PR queue

[18:31] <jnthn> nwc10: There's been a few things easy to review while I wait for test results or and between things :)

[18:31] <jnthn> *or am

[18:31] <nwc10> ah OK. I don't have permission to push to rakudo. I think I do to "everything" else (that I've tried to push to)

[18:32] <nwc10> in that, I can't do the last step on an approved PR, so it's not bceause "I'm slacking" or "I had some reason not to want to"

[18:38] <nine> nwc10: that's good to know!

[18:46] <jnthn> nwc10: I doubt there'd be any objections to you having a commit bit, I think it needs a CLA signing or some such

[18:49] <nwc10> As I'm officially an employee, do I need to get my employer to approve this? :-)

[19:01] <jnthn> That'd depend on the employment contract, I guess. :)

[19:01] <nwc10> I've not actually seen one of those.

[19:03] <nine> IANAL but in Austria a company cannot lay claim to software you develop in your spare time - unless you're using significant company resources to do so

[19:05] <nwc10> nine: I think that the backstory on this joke is that the boss is nearer to the printer than I am, but she's on the sofa and unlikely to get up to visit it.

[19:11] <ugexe> i've gotten quasi-patches in email before, and when i inquired about it it was because of their employer (Apple)

[19:16] <ugexe> (inquired why they didn't submit the PR themselves or want to be credited)

[19:17] <jnthn> nwc10: You have it better than I do; when I ask the boss something I have to provide the question *and* the answer... :)
