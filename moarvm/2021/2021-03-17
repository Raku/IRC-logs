[10:02] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: does the following hang on your system? MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 ./perl6-m --profile -e 'my @a = 42 xx 4'

[10:03] <MasterDuke> huh. it does

[10:05] <MasterDuke> it's sitting here src/profiler/instrument.c:370

[10:16] <dogbert11> perhaps the spesh thread has stopped working when that line is reached

[10:18] <MasterDuke> the opposite, right? it's waiting for spesh to stop

[10:18] <dogbert11> yeah, my reading skills are sub par it seems :)

[10:19] <MasterDuke> speaking of profiling, saw this on HN and it looks interesting https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope

[18:07] <japhb> They're not kidding about a snappy UI.  Assuming they didn't doctor it, the demo video in the Pyroscope README shows really impressive responsiveness.
