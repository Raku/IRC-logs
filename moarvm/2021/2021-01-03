[19:23] <nwc10> thanks

[19:23] <nwc10> I'd actually realised that if I hack a few things locally, I can generate the makefile for any "OS"

[19:23] <nwc10> and verified this

[19:23] <nwc10> coming soon-ish, a branch with this fixed, and some other things

[19:24] <nwc10> but confirmation is useful

[19:30] <timotimo> so, the version of the debug server protocol that is 1.2 would have returned the type of an invocation's result object as "type", and i changed it to "obj_type" so it doesn't conflict with the message type

[19:31] <timotimo> but there isn't actually a version of moarvm that sent any invoke result messages, because invoke was just implemented

[19:31] <timotimo> is it really necessary to up the minor version here? could this even be a major version increment that i'd need to do?

[19:32] <nwc10> by "isn't actually a version of moarvm" you mean it wasn't even in last month's release?

[19:32] <timotimo> right

[19:33] <timotimo> but also i added a new messagetype (well, one request and the corresponding answer)

[19:33] <nwc10> I think that "you can get away without bumping it" and actually to avoid churn, it's probably better not to bump it

[19:33] <nwc10> as to the new message type, I don't know the answer to "Does that really need a bump?"

[19:34] <timotimo> maybe bumping it by one minor is sensible

[19:35] <timotimo> releasable6: status

[19:35] <releasable6> timotimo, Next release in â‰ˆ19 days and â‰ˆ23 hours. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[19:35] <releasable6> timotimo, Details: https://gist.github.com/611231596afa06de7a6bdd6a24dcbc6b

[19:35] <nwc10> Ooh, late stage personal QA paranioa testing reveals that I would have broken cygwin.

[19:37] <timotimo> so i think this is ready for a first merge

[19:37] <timotimo> almost,anyway

[19:40] <timotimo> oh, i think i may also want to add a flag that allows you to invoke code, but rather than immediately running, stop execution

[19:41] <timotimo> i guess a better debug client would be smart enough to set a breakpoint properly
