[06:25] <japhb> Are there any GC tunables available from up at the Raku level other than `VM.request-garbage-collection` (AKA nqp::force_gc)?

[06:27] <japhb> I'm facing occasional GC hiccups in my server that jump from 1-5ms to 100-150ms, which is well into the territory of "consciously noticeable by humans".  I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to alter that for latency apps.

[06:29] <japhb> (Testing generally indicates humans prefer medium-but-steady performance to high-but-unpredictable performance for anything involving human reaction times.  Of course, truly steadiness won't make up for truly poor performance, but that's a whole different problem.)

[06:30] <japhb> *Of course, steadiness

[06:31] <japhb> It would be nice to be able to tune steadiness versus throughput for the GC behavior, but I understand that's a whole pile of research of its own.

[06:51] *** domidumont joined
[07:30] <MasterDuke> japhb: i don't think there's anything else available from raku, and not much in moarvm either that could be exposed. definitely not at the maturity of the jvm in that regard

[07:34] <japhb> Dang.  Well, I knew it was a long shot, but I figured I'd ask in case I missed something.

[10:34] <lizmat> yup... now only to not have this fire after landing  :-)

[10:51] <brrt> (what rocket are we talking about today?)

[10:52] <nwc10> https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/spacex-successfully-lands-a-starship-test-flight/ -- In general, this has been followed by a dramatic explosion as one aspect or another of the incredibly complex series of events required doesn't work quite right. The biggest exception was one case where that explosion waited for several minutes after the rocket's landing.   Today's launch followed the script right 

[10:52] <nwc10> up to the landing, at which point everything changed. The landing went off without a hitch this time, and the hardware stayed intact—albeit on fire—well after the landing.

[10:55] <brrt> ooh, nice

[11:23] <timotimo> japhb: have you considered grabbing a heap snapshot or two, or looking at allocation statistics in the profiler's output?

[11:26] *** MasterDuke left
[11:28] <timotimo> most helpful is that the profiler will count up for each type how many of them were freed by a minor or by a major collection

[11:29] <timotimo> types that get collected majorily in minor collections contribute to other objects becoming considered "older" at shorter lifetimes

[18:58] <japhb> timotimo: I'll look into both of those.  Yesterday I needed to feel more success and less yak shaving, so I did actual MUGS-level work.  :-)

[20:53] <japhb> timotimo: So far, pretty minor stuff, just to feel out the APIs.  Guessing games, tic-tac-toe, that sort of thing.  One of the other Rakoons (raydiak?) asked if I would put some more energy into action games, to fill out more of those pieces of the API.

[20:54] <japhb> That's when I discovered that JSON wasn't going to cut it any more and wrote CBOR::Simple (and TinyFloats, and Cro::CBOR) to have a more efficient (and faster to validate on message receipt) encoding.

[20:55] <japhb> So while I wait for the next Cro release, I've been working on server-side generated particle effects that are rendered client-side, in order to test sending game state updates with hundreds of updates per frame.

[23:21] <tbrowder> [Coke]: you're welcome. and i just recompiled moarvm separately and i found a couple of warnings in 3rd party libs. i'll add those to the issue in a bit.

[23:22] <tbrowder> fixing them is beyond my current c fu

[23:29] <[Coke]> might be worth keeping the 3rd party lib warnings separate since we can't as easily fix them and may have to report them upstream

[23:51] <tbrowder> yepper, i thought about that, then passed the buck for now :-(

[23:51] <tbrowder> i'll be fresher tomorrow...
