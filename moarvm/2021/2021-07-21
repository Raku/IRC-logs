[10:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh! :)
[10:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> But hm
[10:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> I thought the temp roots had handling for that
[10:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ohh, but I guess the memory can get reused if we end up doing lazy deopt or similar 
[10:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> That's sneaky
[10:11] <Nicholas> "more interesting effects than desired" - that's code for something? :-)
[10:11] <Nicholas> ASAN would be pleased?
[10:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> My guess is that 1) we MVMROOT the frame, which normally is not a problem even if it's stack allocated because we account for that, but 2) we're unwinding frames, but unwinding a frame can result in new allocations on top of the callstack due to lazy deopt, meaning that 3) if we do a GC run it is effectively doing a use-after-free except it's not really a free visible to ASAN etc. just that memory means
[10:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> something else now.
[10:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> So interesting is probably "thinks it's looking at a collectable but it's just junk"

[13:02] <jnthnwrthngtn> like prepargs and so forth?
[13:06] <nine> No, that's done by call handler in QASTOperationsMAST with just a few minor adjustments for nativeinvoke

[13:09] <nine> Are there any big changes with regards to native values?
[13:16] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: there's a bit of a thinko here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/new-disp/src/core/callsite.c#L258 at this point the array has not yet been extended, because you changed the MVM_realloc to MVM_fixed_size_realloc_at_safepoint in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0a948570e7ca489854e5ea818d16b2c64b8b9662
[13:17] <nine> That causes the heap buffer overflow
[13:17] <nine> Does the fixed size allocator zero out the memory in realloc? In that case the memset could just go
[13:20] <MasterDuke> nope https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/new-disp/src/core/fixedsizealloc.c#L222-L266
[13:21] <MasterDuke> MVM_fixed_size_realloc_zeroed would probably be easy to create
[13:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Huh, I thought it was the free of the previous location that was delayed, and the extension was immediate?
[13:22] <nine> Oh, wait a minute. I think the misunderstanding is mine

[13:22] <nine> I got confused by the name

[14:28] <lizmat> MasterDuke: ^^^ would that need to be bumped as well ?   or is that more of a support issue
[14:31] <MasterDuke> it needs a bump and something else (maybe some kind of rebootstrap) to have any impact for nqp, but it's not necessary to do right away
[14:32] <dogbert17> nine++, you're on a roll. I might actually be out of bugs atm.
[14:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Can't repro that; did you `make clean` first?
[14:32] <lizmat> MasterDuke: ok
[14:32] <MasterDuke> i see the names that i removed in src/vm/moar/stage0/MASTOps.moarvm, but i just did a rebuild and rebootstrap and they're still there (but not all the DEPRECATED_* names, so something removed the others previously)
[14:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> Please don't rebootstrap NQP maser
[14:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> *master
[14:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> It will make the new-disp rebase/merge hell
[14:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, it may
[14:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Actually I guess I just take the new-disp ones 
[14:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> So it's not so bad
[14:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, maybe...
[14:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: I removed some things in the instance structure and it may just be that the extops weren't rebuilt 
[14:34] <MasterDuke> if that PR is merged and then you rebase new-disp and re-run update_ops.raku and rebootstrap, its changes will get picked up automatically
[14:35] <MasterDuke> but i don't know why those names are still there after i do a local rebootstrap

[15:13] <MasterDuke> some traits cause the gist to not use .name and instead fall back to the type name+role name
[15:13] <MasterDuke> why/how the difference?
[15:14] <nine> MasterDuke: I guess that's because the role for default is anonymous while the one for pure is called is-pure

[15:15] <MasterDuke> don't think so, DEPRECATED is a named role also

[16:34] <timo> ah, ok!
[16:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> Current problem is that JIT explodes
[16:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> And the JIT of sp_getarg_* certainly needed updating but...
[16:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> ...my attempt to do so didn't help. I'm not sure if that is the thing with the wrong JIT, however

[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> But I still get explosions. You can uncomment the two calls to MVM_spesh_log_entry in order to enable spesh and observe it
[16:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> timo: The latest commit is my attempt to fix it; maybe you can spot some thinko in there
[16:38] <timo> do yo uneed to grab the address of the map rather than the value perhaps
[16:39] <timo> like does mov TMP1, FRAME:TMP1->params.arg_info.map; have to be lea instead of mov
[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> .map is a poitner to an array
[16:39] <timo> ah
[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, a MVMuint16*
[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> So that should already be reading the pointer
[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> I wonder if I got the widths wrong somewhere
[16:39] <timo> i have no experience with the U16:TMP[idx] syntax you're using here
[16:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Me either. :P
[16:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> brr<tab>...aww
[16:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Of course, this may not be the reason for the SEGV
[16:40] <timo> a few lines above has         | mov TMP1, REGISTER:TMP1[idx]; and that works correctly
[16:40] <timo> right, it could be that this unlocks the entirety of the jit to run and gives us a huge area of attack
[16:42] <MasterDuke> huh. so adding `$r.^compose` to pure works (i.e., `class A { method a() is pure { say "hi" } }; say A.^methods` outputs '(a BUILDALL)'), but adding to nodal is what gives that `Serialization error: parameterized type to intern not in current SC`
[16:43] <timo> you can disassemble when stopped in gdb, but i think you can only actually get earlier instructions if you get it to see the beginning address of the "function"
[16:43] <MasterDuke> in stage mast of CORE.e.setting
[16:43] <timo> like `x/i address` would "examine as instructions"
[16:47] <jnthnwrthngtn> It segfaults on
[16:47] <jnthnwrthngtn> mov    (%rcx,%rdx,2),%rcx
[16:47] <jnthnwrthngtn> Which looks rather like what I was doing
[16:53] <timo> you know
[16:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> ah, I shoudla sign-extended the uint16 
[16:53] <timo> why not put a `| mov TMP1, 0xFACEFACEFACEFACE` where you expect you are
[16:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> Now rdx looks sensible
[16:53] <timo> but yes indeed sign extending good idea
[16:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> But rcx looks like a very dodgy pointer

[17:02] <Nicholas> doesn't do junctions at the hardware level?

[17:07] <timo> i just ran a random nqp test with spesh log and it's just "received log with 0 frames having their statistics updated" over and over :D
[17:07] <timo> makes me wonder if we ever want to log like the histogram of what spesh log entry types we see, since we iterate over them anyway to update the stats
[17:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> You did uncomment the thing I mentioned, right?
[17:07] <timo> oh!
[17:07] <timo> i missed that
[17:08] <timo> i see it now
[17:09] <timo> yeah now i get a segfault, so i can at least look at what's happening :)
[17:10] <MasterDuke> huh. changing the `$r.^mixin` to `$r does` gives `Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)` during stage parse
[17:10] <timo> => 0x470b20:    add    $0x0,%al

[17:12] <timo> yes i disabled that (i hope)
[17:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> timo: So if you're not disabling that I suspect you'll run right into the same issue

[17:21] <Nicholas> Possible 100% otherwise. Based on previous public information, he was in the office today. And I've never heard mention of an office beer fridge.
[17:22] <Nicholas> (Coffee exists at both locations)
[17:22] <Nicholas> (I believe that the office doesn't *need* a beer fridge as it has a fully operational pub "on tap")
[17:22] <Nicholas> I wonder *why* they chose that location for an office...

[17:51] <timo> this one was stringifying what loc_12_str gets
[18:01] <timo> ok i *think* i'm correctly stepping into the jitted version of "method_table", which is what the "lang-meth-call" calls

[18:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> Sounds pretty fscked to me...
[18:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas is right - no beer fridge at office. The office is located where it is because I used to live in the same building, and knew the landlord was good, and was looking for an office, and just in time one became free. :)
[18:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Of course, that makes the question "did you deliberately choose to live near a pub", and I guess there answer is "have you seen the pub density in Prauge?" :P
[18:20] <timo> so did you choose prague because the pub density makes the question whether you decided to live / work near a pub useless? :)
[18:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> Maaaaybe :P
[18:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> timo: I'm assuming that the loc_8_obj ends up in loc_11_obj by the time of the existskey? Or something connects these two?
[18:21] <timo> there's a set in between, yeah
[18:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Dinner is ready, bbl
[18:22] <timo> i think the "when" isn't very precise, so i'll have to step around a bit more backwards and forwards, but i don't really have a reason to believe what goes in or what happens inside method_table is going wrong
[18:26] <timo> ok but why do we stringify that result tho

[20:35] <timo> 00000      sp_getarg_o        loc_2_obj, 0                                                                           
[20:35] <timo> 00001      sp_get_o           loc_4_obj, loc_2_obj, 48    
[20:35] <timo> 00002      return_o           loc_4_obj                                                                              
[20:35] <timo> it kind of sort of feels like it's grabbing a BOOTStr out of that obj there
[20:36] <timo> this should be getting the methods hash out of an NQPClassHOW
[20:39] <timo> hum, and the param that comes in at source[map[0]] is an NQPClassHow
[20:40] <timo> ok, let's see then if the getarg is compiled right
[20:43] <timo> what do we emit a jmp rdx for? i don't see anything that actually sets rdx to anything
[20:45] <timo> wha. rdx just has the address of the instruction that comes right after the jmp in it, right from the start of execution
[20:47] <timo> oh!
[20:47] <timo> the current frame has a params.version of 0
[20:49] <timo> is that actually wrong? the legacy struct for the params doesn't look right either, but the map of that params is a null pointer?
[21:02] <timo> i get the feeling we're dereferencing one too many times?
[21:12] <timo> i think TMP1 + TMP2 * 2 is wrong?
[21:13] *** dogbert17 left
[21:13] <timo> well, changing it to TMP2 * 8 makes t/nqp/003-if-else.t work fine
[21:15] <timo> this was for getting param_info.sources[param_info.map[arg_index]], it used to multiply the result from the map by just 2, but should have been 8
[21:26] <timo> every time i run "make test" in nqp it does a bit of compiling first, which segfaults
[21:26] <timo> why :|
[21:27] <MasterDuke> yeah, that annoyed me a while ago and i did a little digging. it wasn't quite as easy to fix as i hoped
[21:28] <MasterDuke> also you can't `make t/individual/test/file`, which maybe was related?
[21:28] <timo> mhm, i just copypasted the "prove" line now
[21:29] <timo> still a bunch of test files crashing, but many pass now
[21:35] *** squashable6 joined
[21:36] <timo> here's a crash that might be related to how named arguments work in the new argument format?
[21:36] <timo> it's accessing the argument in map's slot number 3, but there are only 3 flags, one of which is named
[21:37] <timo> so there are 3 valid entries in the map, 0, 1, and 2. 3 is what it's using instead and that's a much too high value, in the hundreds

[21:39] <timo> fantastic how it has so many spaces at the end there
[21:39] <timo> anyway, you can see how it's got a LOAD ARG 3 in slot 5, that's the one that asplodes
[21:43] <timo> that's certainly a lot fewer failing tests
[21:47] <timo> which is 0
[21:47] <timo> the amount of failing tests in the nqp test suite is 09
[21:48] <timo> no not 09, it's 0
