[08:45] <jnthnwrthngtn> Moarning. So it turns out I can turn one of the failing NQP tests after switching method dispatch to new-disp into a SEGV by deleting some of the test, and so probably the other odd failure mode is also a result of some kind of memory corruption...

[08:46] <Nicholas> "my machine" (several of them) are currently powered down because they in Oregon, and it's hot there.

[08:47] <Nicholas> so I don't have access to anything fast with ASAN or valgrind

[08:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm guessing "hot" means "very unusually hot"...

[08:51] <Nicholas> whole of the west coast of North America is, I believe. Canada is breaking records.

[08:51] <moon-child> yeah, last few days have been hell

[08:51] <Nicholas> so powering down non-essential services seemed like a good plan

[09:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> uhh...

[09:21] <jnthnwrthngtn>     MVMObject *fateres = MVM_repr_alloc_init(tc, tc->instance->boot_types.BOOTIntArray);

[09:21] <jnthnwrthngtn>     MVM_ASSERT_NOT_FROMSPACE(tc, fateres);

[09:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> The assert fails right after allocation?!

[09:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, I guess it means something wrote into the previous nursery

[09:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> So it's not all zeroed

[09:41] <Nicholas> ooh fun. Once upon a time I had a hacky patch to allocate nurseries with mmap and change them to unaccessable when not in use. That would have exploded with this.

[09:41] <Nicholas> if your guess is right

[09:42] <Nicholas> hmm, I wonder *how* hacky it is, and whether it's viable to make it a conditional compile...

[09:42] <Nicholas> but not this morning. Or at least, this part of today.

[09:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, I did wonder about mprotect hacks

[09:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> Can't rr it as it seems not to support AMD CPUs (or AMD CPUs don't support it...)

[09:50] <Nicholas> Aaa(rr)gh

[09:50] <Nicholas> At least one of the (powered off) machines could run rr

[09:51] <Nicholas> I can't remember if it was Intel, or if there is some new enough AMD CPU that rr can work with.

[09:51] <Nicholas> Either way, can't currently help

[09:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, it seems there are patches in rr for zen and zen 2 architectures, but I think I've zen 3

[09:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> So mine is maybe too new

[09:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> argh

[10:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Turns out the cheap way to get some an effect is to free the fromspace memory always after GC is done

[10:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> And then let ASAN report the write to freed memory

[10:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> Goodness, this finds all kinds

[10:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Bleh, though having now fixed those, it turns out they weren't the actual issue the test runs into, which instead seems to be about memory managed with the FSA

[10:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> meeting and lunch now, guess I'll try to hunt it down later

[10:48] <nine> Nicholas, jnthnwrthngtn: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9d468afcaf21b01a85126142c758674d9f5b579c

[10:51] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: rr runs just fine on zen3. I use https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Zen#kernel-module

[10:52] <nine> Just load that kernel module and rr works like a charm

[10:52] <sena_kun> jnthnwrthngtn, https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Zen says it should work. :/

[11:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh. When I ran rr it pointed me to a github issue about it, when I read through, and saw no mention of that :)

[14:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Current NQP HEAD compiles call and callmethod QAST nodes into dispatch instructions.

[14:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> It builds. 3 failing tests, 2 a bug I need to hunt, 1 an NYI. Also an intermittent hang that I'm looking at now.

[14:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> I also discovered that the QAST regex compiler will need updating since it directly emits findmeth/invoke. There are likely some other such places to update too
