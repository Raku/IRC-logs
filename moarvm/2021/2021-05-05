[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Convert MVM_num_{isnanorinf,posinf,neginf,nan} to inline functions.

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: They are all one-liners - likely the size of the inlined code is smaller

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: than the calling convention setup.

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: (Unless one is building with Link Time Optimisation, in which case *that*

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: will do the transformation, but even then, why make more work for ourselves?)

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: This has the side effect of moving `#include <math.h>` to a header file,

[06:10] <geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: meaning that various C files no longer need to include it.

[10:08] <jnthn> nwc10++ # for many things

[10:09] <nwc10> but never enough things, it seems, as I still seem to have a long list to do.

[10:10] <jnthn> I know that feeling very well.

[10:32] <nine> TODO lists only ever grow

[10:34] <lizmat> .oO( the item on my todo list for shrinking my todo list, is still on it )

[10:36] <nine> The thing is: one just has to accept this as a fact of life. The illusion that one could ever get ahead of one's TODO list only creates stress. Software is never finished. The more you work on it, the more you learn, the more possibilities for future work open up.

[10:37] <lizmat> case in point: https://logs.liz.nl/moarvm/today

[10:37] <lizmat> the most recent log is yesterday's  :-)

[10:37] <lizmat> search doesn't work yet

[10:37] <nine> So it's pointless to even try to get it shorter. This leaves you with just 2 reasonable options going forward: 1. work on the things you're most interested in (i.e. optimize for fun) and 2. teach others to do the things you're not as much interested in (share the fun)

[10:38] <lizmat> the channel selection pulldown doesn't work yet

[10:38] <lizmat> I like the "share the fun" idea

[15:42] <nwc10> OK, strange, Wim_MVM_reloc failed twice, bombing out somewhere in the second "Step" of the v6c setting

[15:42] <nwc10> third time "lucky"
