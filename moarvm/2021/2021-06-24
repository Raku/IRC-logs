[07:48] <dogbert17> nine: what conclusions do you draw from that result?
[07:51] <nine> None. Except that the bug is somewhat elusive. This is quite typical for bugs that depend on precise timing or memory layout to reveal themselves. Like errors you get when run in make test but not when running a test file individually.
[07:52] <dogbert17> I tried turning off some spesh features. MVM_SPESH_PEA_DISABLE didn't fix the problem nor did MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE. I couldn't get the problem to occur when MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE was set but perhaps it just takes longer.
[07:52] <nine> Oh, wait a minute! It did actually fail in rr :)
[07:53] <nine> I just forgot that I started the rr run in the shell where I previously run it without any additions (the one case where I could get it to fail)
[07:53] *** patrickb joined
[07:53] <nine> Just took 1540 tries to fail in rr
[07:54] <dogbert17> that is fantastic
[07:54] <MasterDuke> nice
[07:57] <nine> And the bug may even be quite straight forward
[07:58] <nine> We deserialize the method cache at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L3171
[07:58] <nine> Then run the work_loop to deserialize its entries. This may trigger GC. Since the cache at that point is not referenced by any root, we free it.
[07:59] <nine> Serialization and deserialization runs with allocation in gen2 enabled, so we don't have tons of MVM_ROOT in the (de-)serialization code. But that only protects against pointers getting moved. Not actually against stuff getting freed.
[07:59] <MasterDuke> move that ASSIGN_REF to right after the deserialize?
[08:00] <nine> Yep, that sounds about right
[08:05] <nine> Except for b4cd2a6555
[08:05] <nine> So maybe MVM_ROOT is the way to go

[09:37] * jnthnwrthngtn wonders how many days he is away from killing off that method cache... :)
[09:38] <lizmat> .oO( its days are numbered! )
[09:50] <Nicholas> hacking days, or calendar days?
[09:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> Given I've not got that much consulting stuff on my plate in July, those might be somewhat similar for the next while :)
[09:56] <Nicholas> woohoo! Party on.
[10:01] <nine> Oh darn....apparently the MVMROOT did not fix the issue. After 2 hours of running the test in a loop I got the error again
[10:01] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: MVMROOTing something should keep it from getting collected, shouldn't it?
[10:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Only during the time the MVMROOT is in dynamic scope
[10:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> But otherwise, yes, it counts as a GC root
[10:04] <nine> I.e. MVMROOT(tc, cache, { if (sr->working == 1) work_loop(tc, sr); }); when deep inside work_loop GC gets triggered
[10:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, that should suffice
[10:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> If it doesn't, there's something else going on
[10:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> But also, I thought everything deserialized ended up in gen2 anyway
[10:07] <lizmat> maybe the process itself creates objects in the nursery?
[10:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> "the process"?
[10:08] <lizmat> the deserialization process
[10:08] <lizmat> like a loop variable?
[10:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> It shouldn't, in so far as the "please allocate directly in gen2" flag shuld be set at all times when we're in the deserialization process
[10:09] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: gen2_default is definitely set. But getting into gen2 doesn't protect something from getting freed, does it? After all we may still do a full collection
[10:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: This is correct, yes.
[10:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> But. hm
[10:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> The trigger for a full collection is a full nursery
[10:10] <nine> I can trigger the bug reliably by adding an MVM_gc_enter_from_allocator(tc); after cache = MVM_serialization_read_ref(tc, sr);
[10:10] <nine> While if I enter gc inside the MVMROOT, nothing happens
[10:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> So I guess this only happens when there's another thread working while this one is deserializing
[10:13] <nine> I wonder if my fix is correct but it's just that we have a similar bug elsewhere
[10:14] <nine> It did take 2 hours to trigger it again after all
[10:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> Possible; the deserialization code has probably usually always been inovked as the only running thread
[10:24] <nine> cache = MVM_serialization_read_ref(tc, sr);
[10:25] <nine> And once you start looking. At this point in read_param_intern, ptype and its STable are not rooted: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L2695
[10:25] <nine> They are in gen2, but not referenced
[10:25] <nine> And we even do a nursery allocation

[12:28] <Nicholas> ...
[12:29] <Nicholas> moar: src/core/interp.c:129: MVM_disp_inline_cache_get: Assertion `slot < cache->num_entries' failed.
[12:29] <Nicholas> Aborted
[12:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: You mentioned it before. I failed to repro it.
[12:57] <Nicholas> Was it the same testcase?
[12:57] <Nicholas> that's a spectest. I think that the previous was nqp
[12:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> I already fixed the NQP build valgrind barf
[12:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm pretty sure the order was this one (failed to repro), the NQP one (fixed), and this one again. The assertion fail and test name look familiar, anyway
[13:00] <Nicholas> *at least* one of us is confused :-)

[13:01] <Nicholas> FSA assertion panic in NQP. Seems to be only on one machine I have access to

[13:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, I had forgotten the FSA one, I'm not sure if I conclusively failed to repro that
[13:18] *** patrickb left
[13:24] <Nicholas> IIRC I only had it on that machine, so I thought it might be compiler dependant
[13:37] <MasterDuke> just a plain checkout of new-disp+setting FSA_DEBUG doesn't repro it for me
[13:38] <MasterDuke> but i did get some sort of crash in rakudo's t/04-nativecall/01-argless.t once, but i can't repro it
[13:47] <MasterDuke> is it expected that a lot of spectests fail?
[14:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: Probably
[14:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: I've not run spectest in a while on that branch; it feels like a long shot that it'd be close to passing given things are half way between two dispatch systems
[14:22] <MasterDuke> ok, won't mention the failing ones then
[14:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Segfaults are useful to know about as those absolutely shouldn't happen, but other failure modes aren't surprising. Certain things always end up in the new dispatcher, but then encounter things that aren't set up for it.
[14:24] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think I've probably gone about as far as I can with "sort of keep things working but turn on new-disp with an env var"; any next step runs into too many discrepancies.
[14:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> Upcoming commits will work towards switching every call and callmethod compiled on MoarVM to the new dispatch mechanism.
[14:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> And then getting NQP happy again. I expect during that time even the Rakudo build will be busted.
[14:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> I can't really go any further with Rakudo because the next step is to compile the setting with new-disp used for multi dispatch
[14:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, and everything really
[14:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> But that immediately runs into the problem that trying to call trait modifiers from the compiler blows up, because NQP calls aren't using new-disp
[14:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> With that road having run out under me, there's not much for it than going for switching NQP over.
[14:31] <[Coke]> Makes sense to me, FWIW - Will others be able to chip in to help, or will that make it harder?
[14:31] <[Coke]> (or, I suppose I mean, will others not be able to help because you'll be fixing the one next broken thing each time?)
[15:02] <jnthnwrthngtn> [Coke]: I think once we're at the point where the big switchover is done and we're hunting regressed spectests, yes
[15:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yay, got lang-call working
[15:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> (dispatcher that will delegate to the appropriate HLL dispatcher)
[15:16] <Nicholas> you have the beer fridge ready for later?
[15:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes
[15:16] <Nicholas> Good. (Just checking)
[15:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Going to try and get lang-meth-call working before language class, though :)
[15:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, almost got it...
[15:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> bbl
[15:51] *** patrickb joined
[17:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Seems Geth is giving my push the silent treatment, but the lang-call and lang-meth-call are in :)
[17:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> The next step will be to change the QAST compiler to emit dispatch ops using them for `call` and `callmethod` nodes.
[17:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> And then fix the world that results :)
[17:23] <Nicholas> useless bot
[17:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Anyway, all that sounds too much effort for a sunny evening when there's beer in the fridge. :)
[17:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh! I also have mead...
[17:29] <Nicholas> #firstworldproblems
[17:30] <Nicholas> have fun - it's still a bit too hot and humid outside here for me to find it enjoyable to sit outside
[17:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm about to test how it is here. I think it is hot and humid but there seems to be a breeze that will make it tolerable...
[17:35] <leont> @jnthnwrthngtn: didn't know you were also a mead drinker 🙂

[18:17] <Nicholas> I realse. I think I last drank mead before I learned perl.
[18:52] <MasterDuke> i always thought i would like mead, and want to, but never really have
[18:53] <MasterDuke> but there is a bigger cider selection here than in the us, so i've been trying lots of different ciders
[20:21] *** patrickb left
[22:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> leont: I wasn't until relatively recently, when I ordered a bunch of beer, the shop were out of one, and by cunning or incompetence substituted it with another product of the same brewery...which happened to be a mead.
[22:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Instead of complaining, I drank it, found it pleasant enough, and ordered some more the next time. I've nowhere near enough experience to know if what I'm drinking counts as a good mead. :)

[22:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Also: wow, this brewery have their own eshop now, that's new.
[22:18] <jnthnwrthngtn> Now I don't have to figure who has their stuff in stock this time.
