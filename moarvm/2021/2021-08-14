[11:26] <timo> still thinking about how to junctions with dispatchers

[11:27] <timo> using resumption would perhaps allow me to only use dispatchers, which means i don't have t fiddle with capture objects and flattening, which i'm not sure how exactly the inlining deals with this at the moment

[11:28] <timo> but that requires some piece of code to be in place to actually ask for resumption when one call is done, and also something to collect the results for the return value

[11:28] <timo> so i think that's no bueno

[11:29] <timo> with a code handling the looping, i'm not sure if dispatchers will be of much use at all?

[11:38] <timo> or perhaps a dispatcher that implements "replace a single argument in the capture and invoke" could help? does that even make sense?
