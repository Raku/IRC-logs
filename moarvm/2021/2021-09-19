[15:22] <nine> dogbert17: I wonder how you came up with that commit and diff? Neither reverting that part, nor reverting the whole commit fixes things for me. In fact I have to revert almost everything including "Allow inlining of dispatches with resume init args" to get it working.

[15:22] <tellable6> 2021-09-12T20:26:30Z #raku-dev <vrurg> nine Could you, please, merge https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/pull/168 because R#4495 depends on it.

[15:41] <dogbert17> nine: welcome back

[15:41] * dogbert17 tries to figure out what nine is referring to ...

[15:43] <dogbert17> if it's the callframe diff you're referring to then it seems that some comments, from me, should be taken with a grain of salt :(

[15:44] <nine> Ah, yes, talking about callframe

[15:45] <dogbert17> the diff should be ignored but if I didn't mess up completely going back to commit https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/e3c6d39dcd4f530b572494b24f5812c059a8ce88 seems to fix the problem

[15:45] * dogbert17 famous last words

[15:46] <nine> Sorry, can't confirm

[15:46] <dogbert17> let's assume that I was speaking nonsense then :)

[15:47] * dogbert17 retries

[16:08] <dogbert17> hah, I  messed up again my comment about 3c6d39dcd4 fixing the problem is incorrect, that's the commit which seems to introduce the problem

[16:09] <dogbert17> on the previous commit , i.e. a4853302b9ea8 I'm unable to repro the callfram problem. Perhaps I'm not trying hard enough.

[16:10] <dogbert17> s/3c6d39dcd4/e3c6d39dcd4/

[16:12] <dogbert17> nine: did you have a nice vacation?

[16:38] *** patrickb joined
[17:11] <nine> dogbert17: oh yes, very much so, thanks :)

[17:18] <nine> dogbert17: oh, indeed! a4853302b9ea83a63e941a935055b9a9225ce233 does look fine

[17:19] <nine> The major difference is that in the broken version EXISTS-KEY gets inlined.

[17:36] <dogbert17> nine: sounds like you're already zeroing in on the bug

[18:02] <dogbert17> I have, what I believe to be, a much simpler bug which might perhaps be of interest at a later time

[18:24] <nine> dogbert17: I maz have missed that a4853302b9 is still working because from e3c6d39dc on it segfaults until a later commit

[18:30] <nine> Huh...the broken version deopts in 'a' while the working version never does

[18:50] <nine> That deopt happens from the sp_guardconc right before the return_o (idx 20 -> pc 240)
