[08:28] <nwc10> https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0659/ -- For example, if the Python and C call stacks were decoupled and the data stack were contiguous, then Python-to-Python calls could be made very fast.

[08:28] <nwc10> So, kind of line Perl 5 for the past forever.

[12:01] <timotimo> yeah, cpython was meant to have very readable and maintainable source code or something like that?

[12:02] *** reportable6 left
[12:02] <timotimo> heavy optimizations can definitely screw that up
