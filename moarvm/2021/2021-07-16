[13:50] <nine> ?
[13:50] <sena_kun> nine, that's what blin says
[13:51] <sena_kun> I'll look at it later, $dayjob time
[13:54] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: Turns out you did break reproducible build. But that was 2 years agon in https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/d97f3084addf86a5a187d404294deda82b173b70 :D
[14:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Ahread of my time, I guess. :P But hm, is that the same issue that causes it to fail now?
[14:05] <nine> Unfortunately no. Looks like NQP is OK now with my fix though. So it must be something in Rakudo itself
[14:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think at some point you did some fixes so that anything that is compiled while compiling gets incorporated into the enclsoing compunit to fix EVAL at BEGIN time, and I wonder if the stuff I'm compiling is accidentally getting lumped in with that?
[14:11] <nine> The most notable differences are strings that look like "104733760"
[14:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> In case you missed me mentioning this: it was passing, and I broke it with ded9a561417e
[14:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Though that implies there was a problem anyway, just a hidden one

[14:17] *** linkable6 joined
[14:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm not sure how the logic in !produce-reader could lead to that; those numbers are too big to be cuids of the generated blocks...
[14:29] <sena_kun> ok, I know why new-disp branch cannot be built: one needs to bump the thing so that the correct versions were taken (right now it tries to build with moarvm from master and so fails).
[14:30] <sena_kun> I am not sure how to properly make it work from branches, though, I suspect putting just the branch name into the revision is not the way.

[14:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> o.O
[14:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> By code in the test maybe not, but I think during startup (CORE.setting init) it is used...
[14:40] <sena_kun> as I thought, revision templates have no idea about branches
[14:41] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: well, this patch makes the problem go away (note line 10) https://gist.github.com/niner/2c0700ac42d5ae8c5d8bea03de1e69f7
[14:44] <nine> Oh, wait, that should be nqp::die. How does it even survive this?!
[14:50] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg
[14:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: That's just a revert of the PR I pointed at?
[14:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> Plus some error code that won't be reached
[14:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> (because if we pre-fill the readers then we never need to produce them for any cases that you're likely hitting)
[14:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> We can't just pre-define them because then they're not marked as thunks and that causes other failures
[14:56] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: no, I also added a die; in method new. Which in NQP can't work and seems to have been ignored.
[14:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> I don't think it does listops, so it'll have interpreted it as a term
[14:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> And it doesn't seem to bail over those
[14:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> die() likely woulda whined
[15:03] <nine> It seems to be this entry that does the trick: '1%0,', -> $a1, *%n { nqp::dispatch('boot-resume', 6, nqp::decont($a1), |%n) }
[15:03] <nine> The other's don't make a difference
[15:11] <nine> Because 1%0 is the only key that's in use
[15:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> Possibly, yes; a bunch of them I added to cover unary/binary ops
[15:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> If the code in question never passed a Proxy to such an op then they'd not be used
[15:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> The original idea was to prime the hash with a few such cases so we'd not need to go and eval a QAST tree for them
[15:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> But that doesn't work out, because there's no way to get them marked as a thunk
[15:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Thus why I dropped everything in the hash and relied on always going through the generation pass
[15:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Thus why I dropped everything in the hash and relied on always going through the generation pass
[15:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> And it's going through that which seems to trip things up
[15:45] <nine> Yeah, the Proxy in question is CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry's short-id2class
[15:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, I was a little surprised to find myself having to handle multi dispatch over Proxy so relatively early on
[15:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> Had to do it at some point though :)

[15:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> Head wasn't in the right place for figuring out new stuff on $other-project post-vaccination, so figured I'd work on some easy-ish things that needed stuff I've been looking at recently :)
[16:00] <dogbert11> have been subjected to dose 2 then?
[16:00] <dogbert11> *have you been ...
[16:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes
[16:03] <nine> I don't see how just compiling that one block can lead to such massive differences. And it is compilation that throws in the wrench here. Even if we return the hard coded block, it still fails.
[16:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, that's how it looked to me (although I didn't do the analysis you have to rule out other possibilities)
[16:04] <nine> Small discrepancies I could understand, but the diff is massive
[16:04] * sena_kun confirms nqp tests are fixes, 2 files left for rakudo ones
[16:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Where did the EVAL-at-BEGIN-time fix get integrated with the compilation pipeline?
[16:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> Though I'm starting it from the QAST step so hmm
[16:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yay, fixing that method not found thing up didn't just get us NQP tests clean, but also gained one more spectest
[16:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> Presumably one of the "wrong kind of exception" ones dogbert11++ mentioned yesterday

[16:10] <nine> Another bit: it's this call: nqp::getcomp('Raku').compile($block, :from<optimize>); So just creating test QAST::Block object is harmless
[16:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> I suspect integration/advent2011-day07.t
[16:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> is the one I have the best chance of solving with my remaining energy today
[16:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> It needs nqp::can to compile into some kind of dispatcher
[16:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> I was sort of inclined to kill off findmethod and tryfindmethod entirely, but it's probably better to just have them delegate to the dispatcher stuff.
[16:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> heh, it looks like a non-trivial amount of nqp::findmethod usage in Rakudo is working around the fact that NQP doesn't have $obj.Qualified::meth()
[16:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> If we implemented that we could probably be rid of > 50% of it

[16:49] <nine> I.e. turning it into a non-nested compilation
[16:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, nice
[16:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> I wonder if just declaring an empty `my %*COMPILING` would also
[16:55] <nine> Already compiling just that :)

[16:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> bbia
[16:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> *bbiab
[16:57] <nine> Still this doesn't explain the differences between compilation runs though. Even if the compiled frame makes it into the bytecode file, so what? It should always be exactly the same one.
[16:58] * nine likes his computers to be mostly deterministic
[16:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: I don't know, but I didn't give the block a cuid, maybe it synthesizes a filename or compunit name, or something?
[16:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or those sneak in somehow
[16:59] <nine> Further research is needed :D

[19:25] <MasterDuke> the passing TODO is also about X::Syntax::Comment::Embedded
[19:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: I wouldn't expect the `xxx` in the backtrace; the file and (probably accurate rather than always "1") line number is already good
[19:28] <MasterDuke> yeah, if i put it in a file spread over a couple lines it give the right line number
[19:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> yay

[19:30] <MasterDuke> i have no idea if the failing test is correct or not

[19:36] <MasterDuke> oh, i had them backwards above. EVAL "#`" now correctly throws. EVAL "3 * #`\n<invalid comment> 2" now throws X::Syntax::Comment::Embedded instead of X::Syntax::Confused
[19:39] <nine> So! It is just about %*COMPILING<moar><mast_frames>. Everything else can stay shared.
[19:39] <nine> This is...quite weird as mast_frames is just a lookup hash to get a MAST::Frame by cuid.

[19:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> dogbert11: This is distinct to new-disp, not on master also?
[19:41] <dogbert11> on master I don't see it
[19:43] <MasterDuke> don't see it here either
[19:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> Curious. I can repro it
[19:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'd just not expect very much to be being specialized at all at the moment
[19:45] <dogbert11> it still fails for me with inlining, osr and pea disabled but the problem vanishes with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1
[20:06] <nine> I've added debug output in every places that accesses the moar_frames hash and the usage pattern is exactly the same between runs and regardless of whether it's shared or not.
[20:08] <nine> Err... mast_frames hash
