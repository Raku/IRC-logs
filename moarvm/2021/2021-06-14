[13:13] <MasterDuke> anybody here know how to use windbg's time traveling debugger with rakudo?

[15:07] <MasterDuke> because i still haven't quite figured out windbg, i took a small detour and now the gmp branch does build on windows+msvc in our CI. nqp/rakudo (and maybe nqp-configure) need a branch unfortunately, since they have some tommath paths in their makefile to build the runners

[15:11] <MasterDuke> and annoyingly, i don't think we have any way for either moarvm or nqp/rakudo to use a branch of the other in a PR
