[19:03] <MasterDuke> timotimo: it takes a long time to load a large (1.6gb) sqlite file. a large part of that time rakudo is sitting at 100% cpu and near-constant mem used, then the mem used eventually increases and the profile loads

[19:03] <MasterDuke> (this was of profile-compile of the rakudo's CORE.c)

[19:04] <MasterDuke> any way it can be parallelized or sped up?

[19:08] <lizmat> OT: SN10 launch expected before midnight CET

[19:22] <nwc10> I did like SpaceX disruptive innocation

[19:22] <nwc10> Old:

[19:22] <nwc10> deliver hardware to the site

[19:22] <nwc10> folks with long telephoto lens take pictures and post them online

[19:23] <nwc10> other folks take those photos, add captions, post them again online, to make memes

[19:23] <nwc10> New:

[19:23] <nwc10> deliver hardware to the site, pre-labled with memes

[19:23] <nwc10> folks with long telephoto lens take pictures and post them

[19:23] <nwc10> saves 1 step, and troubles with possible copyright infringement

[19:25] <lizmat> :-)

[19:35] <nwc10> so venting | such anticipation | wen hop?

[19:36] <lizmat> :-)   you can get T-shirts with that  :-)

[19:38] <nwc10> The night, er morning, is still young, but so far this was my favourite image of the day, er morning: https://i.redd.it/fe5cx6zkgnk61.jpg
