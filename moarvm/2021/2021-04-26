[08:16] <MasterDuke> now that the release has happened, i'm hoping https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1474 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1426 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1470 can get some eyes on

[08:18] <MasterDuke> jnthn: in the remove opt PR, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1426/commits/14f4cdf4d123551600091b895085f1667495190d is of particular question

[09:10] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i can't even get a dead simple example to work with tracy

[09:18] <MasterDuke> nm, got it working

[09:29] <nwc10> \o

[09:36] *** brrt left
[09:53] <MasterDuke> arg, but i haven't yet got it hacked into the moarvm build...

[10:20] *** bisectable6 joined
[10:21] <MasterDuke> how do i get the Makefile to just add 3rdparty/tracy/TracyClient.cpp to the compile? i.e., my simple test was just `gcc -DTRACY_ENABLE -g -march=native -I tracy/ -lstdc++ -lpthread -ldl -O2 -o at.out tracy/TracyClient.cpp test.c` and that worked (complied and generated data when run)

[10:23] <nwc10> MasterDuke: maybe something like git show 1b60490d2fa1e59db5e21ccfa1ec2b31142860cd build/Makefile.in

[10:24] <MasterDuke> 'fatal: bad object 1b60490d2fa1e59db5e21ccfa1ec2b31142860cd'

[10:24] <nine> MasterDuke: commit is from Apr 17, maybe git remote update?

[10:25] <MasterDuke> ah, thanks

[10:25] <nwc10> "this week" :-)

[10:28] *** sourceable6 joined
[10:30] <MasterDuke> hm, that gets farther...sort of. if i `cp 3rdparty/tracy/TracyClient.cpp 3rdparty/tracy/TracyClient.c` then i get:

[10:30] <MasterDuke> compiling 3rdparty/tracy/TracyClient.o

[10:30] <MasterDuke> In file included from 3rdparty/tracy/common/TracySystem.cpp:41,

[10:30] <MasterDuke>                  from 3rdparty/tracy/TracyClient.c:14:

[10:30] <MasterDuke> 3rdparty/tracy/common/TracySystem.hpp:8:1: error: unknown type name ‘namespace’

[10:31] <MasterDuke> if i don't copy then i still get the `/home/dan/p6/MoarVM/src/main.c:281: undefined reference to `___tracy_emit_zone_begin'`

[10:40] <jnthn> Um, sounds like that's C++ code, not C code.

[10:42] <MasterDuke> yeah, it has an extern "C"

[10:42] <MasterDuke> just got it built...let's see if it works...

[10:43] <MasterDuke> looks like...

[15:04] <MasterDuke> hm, after adding the tracy tracking macros to MVM_(m|c)alloc and MVM_free, the collection program dies with `Instrumentation failure: Memory allocation event was reported for an address that is already tracked and not freed.`, but valgrind doesn't complain...

[15:09] *** cog left
[15:11] <nine> Maybe it missed a free?

[15:14] <MasterDuke> hm, if i add --valgrind and then run under valgrind, valgrind itself dies after the program completes with `Memcheck: mc_main.c:5765 (vgMemCheck_is_valid_aligned_word): Assertion 'VG_IS_WORD_ALIGNED(a)' failed.` and then a valgrind internal stacktrace

[15:14] <MasterDuke> nine: i'm not sure, still exploring this thing. got the same with with --full-cleanup

[15:23] <MasterDuke> nine: unrelated i suspect, but https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1105 might be up your alley

[15:24] <MasterDuke> and still present

[16:02] <nine> MasterDuke: looks to me like that's just missing cleanup of worker threads

[16:02] <nine> part of my more_asan_fixes work in process
