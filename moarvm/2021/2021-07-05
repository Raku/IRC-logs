[12:13] <timo> (gdb) print tc->cur_frame 
[12:13] <timo> $3 = (MVMFrame *) 0x0
[12:13] <timo> well, that's wild
[12:28] <timo> so the problem that's happening in the code dogbert pasted is that we've got a getlexvia_o with index 0, outer 1 on a code object that doesn't have an outer
[12:30] <timo> oh that's an odd stack trace
[12:32] <timo> https://gist.github.com/timo/0cae5c9059771f5ae846ea164b212819
[12:33] <lizmat> interesting
[12:34] <lizmat> is that on HEAD?
[12:34] <timo> Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2020.12-70-g823148834.
[12:34] <timo> so, uh, not quite
[12:35] <lizmat> ah..  hmmm...
[12:35] <timo> could it be dying due to infinite recursion, though?
[12:36] <timo> if the .Str of the "until" is for some reason refering to the $_ that the andthen sets up, then it'd be refering to the result of the loop it's in
[12:36] <timo> that can't be good :)
[12:37] <lizmat> it segfaults immediately for me on HEAD
[12:39] <lizmat> afk again&

[13:14] <timo> on HEAD i also get that humongous stack trace, and the crash position is also the same, in getlexvia_o
[13:14] <timo> also afk&

[13:49] <MasterDuke> i'm on vacation for two weeks in a different timezone, so only on sporadically
[13:50] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Enjoy and relax.
[13:50] <tellable6> 2021-07-03T16:11:18Z #raku <SmokeMachine> patrickb could you confirm if https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/487 was fixed, please?
[13:51] <MasterDuke> but the results from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4145 still seem to hold at HEAD
[13:52] <MasterDuke> i.e., spins with MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1, insta-segv any other options
[13:54] <MasterDuke> patrickb: thanks. getting here wasn't so relaxing, but the rest of the time should be nice

[21:02] <patrickb> o/
[21:03] <patrickb> Does anyone know off hand what the minimum required Windows version for MoarVM is?
[21:06] <Nicholas> \o
[21:06] <Nicholas> Sorry, I have no idea at all
[21:06] <Nicholas> I'm not even sure if I'm competant to guess
[21:07] <Nicholas> the only thing I have learned recently is that MSVC is good at building for earlier versions of Windows. So the "build" requirement might well be Windows 7, but the target might be earlier
[21:13] <moon-child> would be cool if there were a tool that would look at all the symbols a binary uses and figures out what version of windows it needs
[21:26] <ugexe> libuv only supports windows 8+ (although i'd bet it still works on windows 7 since it used to)
