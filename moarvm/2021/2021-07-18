[08:02] <nine> dogbert17: ah, yes, this cannot really work as such: MVM_args_slurpy_positional(tc, &tc->cur_frame->params, GET_UI16(cur_op, 2))

[08:03] <nine> Since cur_frame could be moved by the GC, that pointer into the structure can get outdated

[11:22] <dogbert17> nine++, that was fast :)

[11:23] <dogbert17> there seems to be at least one more GC related bug lurking somewhere in the new-disp branch

[11:27] <dogbert17> here's what it looks like: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/e85f9f02c49ea793355006fe9dfa68c9

[11:36] <dogbert17> hmm, there's a function called MVM_args_slurpy_named in the stacktrace

[12:41] <nine> Could be a similar thing

[12:41] <nine> Didn't have time to check. Visiting parents

[14:00] <dogbert17>  Have a nice visit.
