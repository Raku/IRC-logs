[10:38] <MasterDuke> just performed an interesting experiment. i replaced the `value % 10` on this line with lemire's fastmod implementation from https://lemire.me/blog/2019/02/08/faster-remainders-when-the-divisor-is-a-constant-beating-compilers-and-libdivide/

[10:38] <MasterDuke> *this line https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/coerce.c#L43

[10:39] <MasterDuke> but `my str $s; my $n = now; for ^10_000_000 -> int $_ { $s = $_ }; say now - $n; say $s` was ~0.1s slower (~0.53 before, ~0.63 after)

[10:43] <lizmat> ok, Geth and the RakuIRCLogger should now be more resilient to losing connection to the IRC server

[10:44] <lizmat> if the client now does not receive a PING within 10 seconds of when a PING is expected, it will do a reconnect to the IRC server

[16:51] <MasterDuke> oh interesting, it looks like gmp can use custom allocators, so we could use the fsa for them...
