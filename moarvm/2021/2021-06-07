[21:03] <MasterDuke> ahoy

[21:10] <brrt> how's things

[21:11] <MasterDuke> my dislike for windows has not decreased after attempting to get my replace-tommath-with-gmp branch to build and pass spectests on it

[21:14] <brrt> windows runs games good (ducks)

[21:16] <MasterDuke> that's all i used it for the last year or two i actually had a physical install, but now i just use wine or a linux native port or the ps4 or don't play it at all

[22:07] <MasterDuke> survived a bios update. don't think i've ever had a really bad experience with one before, but they do make me a little nervous

[22:10] <japhb> MasterDuke: At one point one of the motherboard manufacturers offered a board with a spare ROM (*not* EEPROM) that was guaranteed to take you back to a functional (if ancient) state, by moving a switch or jumper or so on the mainboard, so that you could at least boot while you tried to recover the EEPROM you just bricked.

[22:14] <MasterDuke> that would be nice

[22:19] <japhb> It was of course aimed at gamers, under the assumption I guess that if anyone is likely to be unsafe with their firmware it would be them?  Or maybe it was just a recognition that the firmware updates available for gamer MBs were ... less than well QAed.  Or maybe it was "We'd rather not have to deal with replacing someone's bricked board or listening to a giant rant from a disgruntled gamer if it just 

[22:19] <japhb> costs us like 50 cents in parts"

[22:20] <japhb> I'd like to think it wasn't the first, but you never know.

[22:21] <MasterDuke> i've never gone for expensive/gamer MBs, the extra stuff has never seemed worth it

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: how about some extra x16 pcie slots :)

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> where else would you put your video capture cards ðŸ˜‡

[22:24] <AlexDaniel> and don't tell me you don't want several 4k angles of your face during the meetings!

[22:24] <MasterDuke> nowadays i could actually see some value (yes, mainly for the extra pcie slots if i had a use for them (but i don't now)), but definitely not in the past

[23:28] <timo> why isn't your development desktop's motherboard watercooled?
