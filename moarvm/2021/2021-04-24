[12:26] <nine> Oh... SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow src/spesh/stats.c:40 in incomplete_type_tuple

[12:26] <nine> 0x62f000000040 is located 960 bytes to the left of 51200-byte region [0x62f000000400,0x62f00000cc00)

[13:12] <nine> Is it me, or is MVM_spesh_sim_stack_gc_mark neglecting to mark the MVMSpeshSimStackFrame's arg_types's type and decont_type?

[13:14] <nwc10> this is one of those: there are many things where I think "[...] this is out of my league"

[13:14] <nwc10> so, er, sorry, can't help.

[13:14] <nwc10> write the question on a beer bottle and post it to Prague?

[13:21] <dogbert11> nine: so which bug are you hunting now?

[13:33] <nine> Well actually I'm continuing my work on getting native call memory management right once and for all. That heap-buffer-overflow was just accidental. Of course it's not reproducible, but the bug looks pretty clear from reading the code.

[13:34] <nine> I fully understand what's going on and why it's buggy. It just seems _too_ clear to me. How could this have hidden in plain sight so well so far? Makes me wonder if I miss something.

[13:36] <dogbert11> so the investigation continues

[13:37] <lizmat> nine: maybe it is *not* hiding, just responsible for many one-time event crashes ?

[13:38] <nine> lizmat: I've had that hope too often lately, so I'm wary

[13:41] <dogbert11> is it a specific bug report that has turned your attention towards NativeCall?

[13:44] <nine> No, it's actually the continuation of my ASAN fixes that I did at the start of the year. The remaining failures in make test are all because of NativeCall missing the required API for telling the VM what to free and what to leave to the application.

[13:45] <nine> I've already come pretty far with that, but then got side tracked with a few more urgent bug reports

[13:55] <dogbert11> Aha, let me know if you need any help in reproing something

[14:08] <dogbert11> nine: btw, it seems as if Dyncall 1.2 was released in January

[14:09] * sena_kun remembers last time it was updated and shudders

[14:10] <nine> Darn....I just got that heap-buffer-overflow again. But my supposed fix was already in place :/

[14:10] *** Kaiepi left
[14:10] <dogbert11> oops

[14:11] <nine> The good new is: it actually seems reproducible now

[14:11] <dogbert11> That is indeed good news

[14:39] <lizmat> "support for loading macos >= 11.0.1 (Big Sur) dylibs provided by system's "built-in dynamic linker cache of all system-provided libraries" (those dylibs are no longer present on the fs)"

[14:39] <lizmat> wonder if that's the reason for these strange failures I see for IRC::Client on MacOS

[14:40] <lizmat> oth, that is on 10.x
