[14:58] <dogbert17> nine: is this your biggest rabbit hole yet?

[22:37] <MasterDuke> `This representation (NativeRef) cannot unbox to other types (for type IntLexRef)` ?

[22:39] <MasterDuke> it points to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/allomorphs.pm6#L372, which i've changed to `$base  := nqp::pow_I($radix, nqp::atpos($parse, 1), Num, Int);` because i now have nqp::radix* just returning the number of chars converted (still in a bigint though) instead of number of chars converted ** radix
