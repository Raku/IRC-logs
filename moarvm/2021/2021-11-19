[11:16] <nine> Plot twist! The DB::SQLite failure is actually a bug in the module. Though of course (this is becoming a theme) I have no clue why it didn't surface before

[11:24] <timo> good detective work in any case!

[11:27] <nine> lizmat: IIRC Ecosystem::Archive had issues as well?

[11:27] <timo> i wonder if we want to turn a bunch of "null" instructions in a row at the start of a frame into SSE ops :D

[11:45] <timo> we don't specifically align our work pointers, i believe

[11:51] <timo> i only see 0x...0 and 0x...8

[11:53] <nine> The alignment happens implicitly by virtue of MVMFrame and thus MVMCallStackFrame having the proper size

[11:54] <dogbert17> nine: does that mean you have solved all nativecall related issues?

[11:56] <timo> so when the pointers all end in 0 or 8, we have 8-byte-aligned addresses which is for 64bit elements

[11:56] <timo> oh, no, it has to be aligned to something bigger when you want to use sse registers

[11:56] <nine> dogbert17: looks like

[11:59] <timo> probably a rather silly thing to try *shrug*

[12:01] <nine> Probably just not worth it

[12:01] <timo> not yet ;)
