[19:51] <nine> I finally know why the builds of MoarVM master on the OBS failed. Apparently git submodule update is not enough. Neede a git submodule update --init to actually get 3rdparty/ryu populated with files

[19:57] <lizmat> nine++

[19:59] <MasterDuke> huh. then why does it work elsewhere?

[20:02] <nine> I have no idea. Didn't have the same problem on my desktop

[20:02] <nine> But all the script for the OBS does is git pull ; git submodule update

[20:06] <MasterDuke> odd

[20:07] <MasterDuke> old version of git on OBS?

[20:09] <timo> anything in particular about the URLs in the .gitmodules file?

[20:40] <nine> URL is lacking the .git suffix, but that is true for libtommath and libatomicops as well

[20:41] <nine> MasterDuke: the script is running on my server on openSUSE Leap 15.2

[20:41] <nine> Script creates tar ball and .spec file (build description), OBS just builds

[20:41] <nine> That's why one never has build failures due to failure to fetch some git repo

[20:44] <MasterDuke> hm, that was the extent of my ideas

[21:13] <vrurg> Full submodule update cycle in rakudo is 'submodule sync', 'submodule init', 'submodule update'.
