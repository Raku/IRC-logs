[12:58] <nine> The "Cleanup the build system probes" PR was much easier to review than I feared :) Maybe not everything involving build systems is horrible...

[13:41] <nine> I just went through the first page of (25) MoarVM PR's and reviewed all that weren't done by me, were still WIP or were waiting for requested changes.

[13:42] <nine> Actually took just a bit more than an hour. And it reinforced the necessity of investing some quality time into NativeCall

[13:43] <nine> I hope, this has earned me some reviews for my own PRs *hint hint* ;)

[21:42] <nine> MasterDuke: no, I don't?

[21:42] <nine> MasterDuke: thanks for the reviews :)

[21:42] <MasterDuke> hm. i'll just copy it into a new comment then

[21:44] <MasterDuke> i deleted and re-commented, looks like it's there now

[21:44] <nine> That's a lot of pragma for very little code...

[21:46] <MasterDuke> true. but personally i don't like warnings. and so many are required to get it silenced in both gcc and clang

[21:47] <MasterDuke> i mean i wouldn't disapprove the pr over it

[21:48] <nine> Nah, I added it to the commit along with a comment explaining what it's all about

[21:49] <nine> Compiler warnings are too useful to get swamped in false positives as the one about freeing the wrong thing shows

[21:49] <MasterDuke> nine++

[21:50] *** Altai-man left
[22:04] <MasterDuke> nine: two minor comments. for whatever it's worth, i'm happy to approve it as is

[22:07] <nine> The MVM_free_null(si->prog); is just consistent with the rest of the function where MVM_free_null calls were added by Daniel Green

[22:07] * MasterDuke sidles away looking guilty

[22:08] <nine> In your defense, there were NULL assignments in the code before that. You just changed them when introducing MVM_free_null :)

[22:08] <MasterDuke> ha!

[22:09] <nine> I'll leave them for now. They will at least make a hypothetical use-after-free more obvious

[22:11] <MasterDuke> sure

[22:11] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit

[22:11] <nine> afk for the night
