[15:52] <[Coke]> (installing more stuff in a VM) might be nice if we had a shared VM for windows stuff that we could share out, so going through the install process would be beneficial long term, not just for one project.

[16:34] <nine> License most probably won't allow that

[18:32] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn is tweaking "Tweak worker addition for many small tasks" :D

[18:39] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn's tweak makes using .race on Joelle Maslak's example  https://twitter.com/jmaslak/status/1397706847658778627

[18:40] <lizmat> go from 2.4 secs to below 1.0 secs

[18:40] <lizmat> before this change, it actually made things worse, by increasing the time to 2.9 secs

[18:43] <MasterDuke> nice

[19:55] <japhb> Excellent.  Can't wait to try it on my animation examples.  (Unfortunately, that's currently blocked by not being able to build a couple modules at the moment, sigh.)

[19:59] <lizmat> japhb: any core issues preventing that ?

[20:39] <japhb> lizmat: Not sure, $life got in the way of following up, but here's the initial report from last night: https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-JSON-JWT/issues/5

[21:39] <timo> japhb: i would assume there's a native library with a version mismatch or so

[21:39] <timo> like openssl or whatever

[21:48] <japhb> timo: Yeah, that's what I thought too -- went and looked through the system update history and openssl had been upgraded in the last week or so, so I definitely suspected that.  But then I rebuilt today and it worked first time (despite failing multiple times yesterday, gah).

[21:48] <japhb> timo: Also, https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/73 ?  Pretty please?  :-D

[21:59] <timo> finally done, sorry for the delay

[22:06] <japhb> \o/

[22:06] <japhb> No worries, hope you didn't mind the pings.  :-)

[22:14] <timo> no problem at all

[22:15] <japhb> timo: I've updated my previous MUGS release notes to recommend people update to JSON::Fast 0.16+, thanks!
