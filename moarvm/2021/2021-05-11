[09:44] <jnthn> o/

[09:44] <lizmat> \o?

[09:44] <lizmat> \o/ !

[09:48] <MasterDuke> ugh, trying to track file operations in libuv is annoying. and my mouse batteries are dying so middle click (i.e., paste) isn't working...

[09:48] <jnthn> Captian hook? :)

[09:49] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I've yet to see tracking file operations *not* be annoying

[09:50] <jnthn> The Windows/.Net way of doing it was so good at delivering multiple events for what you'd think of as one change that I used to use it as an exercise for debouncing then I was teaching Rx. :)

[09:50] <jnthn> s/then/when/

[09:51] <MasterDuke> ha, but i'm not doing something quite that difficult. just trying to track/trace how libuv does file operations through their source

[09:51] <MasterDuke> i.e., what do they do for ctime on windows

[09:52] <nwc10> "lex, yacc, smoke and mirrors?" - oh wait, that's something else.

[09:52] <jnthn> Oh, I thought you meant change notifications :)

[09:52] <MasterDuke> i try to stay away from those, there be dragons

[09:58] <MasterDuke> hm, looking at the blame for the jvm STAT_CHANGETIME code, looks like it's been unchanged since jnthn's original commit

[10:42] <MasterDuke> ugh, there's surprisingly little documentation (i.e., none at all) about the jdk's "unix" FileAttributeView

[10:54] <MasterDuke> well, looking at the openjdk source reveals more info, but really i guess i should be finding out what exactly libuv does

[10:55] <MasterDuke> since ctime doesn't actually exist on windows, either we skip the test on the jvm, or try to have it manually do whatever libuv does

[11:00] <lizmat> ctime doesn't exist on Win?

[11:00] <lizmat> ah, yes, now I remember

[11:01] <lizmat> it didn't on DOS either

[11:40] <nwc10> I slack. I missed this: https://blog.pyston.org/2021/05/05/pyston-v2-2-faster-and-open-source/

[11:47] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder is interesting also

[11:56] <MasterDuke> looks like the windows c api https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_basic_information has a ctime equivalent that libuv uses

[11:59] <nwc10> OK, oh so curious. The day that I was fist aware of cinder was the same day as that blog post was written

[12:01] *** reportable6 left
[12:03] <MasterDuke> so what should we do for the jvm backend? skip the test if backend eq 'jvm' && os eq 'windows' but leave the op implementation unchanged? try to call the native api ourselves in the op implementation if we get an exception and os eq 'windows'?

[12:04] *** reportable6 joined
[12:05] <nwc10> MasterDuke: erk, I have no idea. I read the question, but I don't know what to suggest

[12:06] <MasterDuke> yeah, not actually sure either. todo/skip the test is the easy answer, especially given that right now we don't even run the jvm tests on windows and i sort of accidentally turned them on in my pr

[12:07] <MasterDuke> so the other option is to instead continue not even running the jvm tests on windows...

[12:11] <MasterDuke> wait, no, they are run...

[12:12] <MasterDuke> no again, there's a constant 'False' in the windows+jvm condition

[12:14] <MasterDuke> there you go https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/ce694df3684b8f62eb5b0c6aacdc14969efd62f6

[12:15] <MasterDuke> 111-spawnprocasync.t now passes, so the only thing holding us back from running the tests are there file op problems

[12:15] <MasterDuke> *these

[12:30] <MasterDuke> well, looks like we already use JNA (library to make accessing native apis easier), so maybe i'll try adding a fallback to the op that tries calling something like GetFileInformationByHandleEx on windows
