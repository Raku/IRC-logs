[10:14] <nine> MasterDuke: doesn't sound like a GC issue to me. Most of all because tc->cur_frame is a part of the ThreadContext struct and that one isn't managed by the GC (would be hard to bootstrap, since we store the GC's state in the ThreadContext as well)
[10:14] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke
[10:15] <nine> MasterDuke: does tc at this point actually look like a valid ThreadContext at all? I.e. does it have appropriate pointers where it ought to have them, do *_num or *_size fields look sane?

[15:06] <nine> MasterDuke: that's a different tc

[15:07] <MasterDuke> ah
[15:09] <MasterDuke> gist updated
[15:10] <MasterDuke> i'd say it looks corrupted
[15:14] <nine> definitely
[15:15] <nine> So cur_frame is what it stumbles over, but it's really either an already freed ThreadContext or a totally bogus tc pointer
[15:16] <nine> Does the program actually use multiple threads?

[15:17] <MasterDuke> that's all it is
[15:21] <nine> Huh...for me it fails differently. I get a sane looking tc->cur_frame, but still a segfault in src/core/interp.c:6394 at found = GET_LEX(cur_op, 2, f); due to f being NULL
[15:22] <nine> Oh, that may be because I disabled the JIT to get a useful backtrace. With JIT I do see a bogus tc
[15:23] <MasterDuke> if it makes a difference, i had the jit disabled

[15:28] *** Kaiepi joined
[15:30] *** Kaiepi left
[15:34] <Nicholas> to confirm - nqp is all "new-disp" all the time, but rakudo is only using new-disp if RAKUDO_NEW_DISP=1 is set in the environment? And setting build will fail with that set (so far it's only tests that mostly work with it)?

[15:42] <dogbert17> MasterDuke++, Nine++ SEGV hunting
[15:43] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: Memory growth yes (well, actually it was the Rakudo commit that did it). There is one spectest that sits eating CPU but not memory, so probably some kind of infinite loop due to a mis-dispatch or similar.
[15:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: Things are all new-disp where they're all new-disp; there's a few places we still emit the legacy invoke instructions or findmeth and so forth that are yet to be migrated.
[15:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> The big one being NQP's multiple dispatch
[15:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> And also the regex compiler
[15:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> Neither is awfully hard to do, just a bit tedious
[15:50] <timo> MasterDuke: can you check with "print &tc" if it's in a register?
[15:50] <timo> could very well be that it's just an optimization
[15:52] <timo> if this is still that "until .Str" code we're analysing?
[15:52] <MasterDuke> Address requested for identifier "tc" which is in register $rdi
[15:52] <MasterDuke> timo: yep
[15:52] <nine> timo: I get the segfault with --optimize=0
[15:52] <timo> right, that's why you get bogus values
[15:52] <timo> cool, then you can go with --optimize=0 for easier debugging :)
[15:53] <timo> i could imagine it's an infinite recursion between "i need to check the result of the list to see if i should iterate" and "i need to iterate the array to see if there's a value in it"
[15:53] <timo> check how deep the backtrace is at the point where it's doing that?

[17:54] <MasterDuke> nine, timo: yeah, we've seen the raku stacktrace. lizmat and i were discussing it yesterday and thought there were two separate bugs. one is the raku infinite recursion, which she thought was in codegen. the other is the segv (if you disable spesh inlining it just spins in the recursion)
[17:55] <MasterDuke> so theoretically fixing the segv would mean that example would just spin regardless of spesh disabled or not until the rakudo bug is fixed

[19:55] <timo> nope ... well, nto that surprising since new-disp changes so much
[19:56] <MasterDuke> yeah, it goes away if spesh inlining is disabled, so since new-disp is missing a bunch of speshing...

[20:20] *** patrickb joined
[20:28] <timo> ok we're recurring from getting a spesh graph from an unoptimized frame into optimizing a call back into probably the same frame again
[20:31] <timo> now, what might the correct resolution be here? there's already in theory a limit to how deep we'll inline, i guess that's not being checked and/or honored when we go through the path where we don't have an optimized candidate yet
[20:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> We're not meant to inline a frame into itself; there should already be a check that we're not doing that
[20:45] <jnthnwrthngtn> Of note https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/inline.c#L67
[20:49] <timo> ah, let me look more closely at this particular bit
[20:51] <timo> ha. that check comes after doing an initial MVM_spesh_optimize of the graph
[20:52] <timo> no, that's is_graph_inlinable, not is_sf_inlinable
[20:52] *** AlexDaniel joined
[20:53] <timo> d'oh it's literally a few lines further up and i missed it haha
[21:03] <timo> ok this one is easy, like i thought, we've got b as the inliner and a as the target_sf
[21:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, a mutual recursion. Yeah, it'd miss that.
[21:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, a mutual recursion. Yeah, it'd miss that.
[21:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> Unless there's a check later in the inline table
[21:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> If not, can scan the inline table of the inlinee for that code ref too
[21:09] <timo> do the inlines already land in some table before try_get_graph_from_unspecialized even returns?
[21:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> If we're inlining a spesh candidate then the candidate has an inlines table
[21:11] <timo> right, this is for when we only have target_sf, no spesh_cand
[21:13] <timo> well, i'm already very deep in the stack, maybe i should go look near the first or second spesh run
[21:16] <timo> cue five minutes of gdb printing stack traces
[21:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, in that case you may have to check it after building the graph etc.
[21:26] <timo> right, at the point of recursion the graph for the inline target has already been built, we're in the process of optimizing it while stumbling into the recursion after all
[21:26] *** linkable6 left
[21:26] <timo> it does have num_inlines = 0 in it, though
[21:27] *** linkable6 joined
[21:32] <timo> i'm sure this code would optimize into something truly amazing if we just inline fifty levels of it into itself/each other
[21:34] <timo> a simple counter for "how deep are we currently in inlining stuff" would be enough for literally every case of accidental infinite recursion of inlinings
[21:36] <timo> who knows if someone will come up with a piece of code that has multiple calls out on every step and so would go pyramid-shaped :D
