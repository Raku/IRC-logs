[09:40] <nine> dogbert2: I can reproduce!

[09:41] <nine> dogbert2: that's the segfault when reading &ctx->legacy.args[i].o due to garbage in *ctx (version 1 MVMArgs and broken pointers)
[09:51] <MasterDuke> obvious fix?
[10:09] <nine> if only :)
[10:11] <dogbert2> nine: very cool, so there's plenty to do while jnthnwrthngtn is on vacation

[16:28] <nine> Good news (for my sanity if nothing else). The missing case MVM_SPESH_ANN_DEOPT_PRE_INS in PEA's add_deopt_materializations_ins is actually critical as well. It's just that we also need to employ MVM_SPESH_ANN_DEOPT_SYNTH to see any difference.
[16:28] <nine> So, yes indeed, to provoke that segfault from a working code base, just remove the case MVM_SPESH_ANN_DEOPT_PRE_INS.
[16:38] <MasterDuke> any reason not to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1472 ?
[16:42] <nine> Not from my side
[16:48] <nine> No Geth? :(

[16:49] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: A dispatch op may get replaced with several guards during optimization. When
[16:49] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: doing this, the first created guard inherits the deopt annotation of the
[16:49] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: original instruction. Further guards got clones of the annotation. While these
[16:49] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: clones would point at the correct place in the bytecode to deopt to, they would
[16:49] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: get newly allocated deopt indexes. PEA materializations are tied to deopt
