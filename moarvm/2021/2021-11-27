[10:43] <nine> Yesterday snow, today sun. Just beautiful :)

[10:45] <lizmat> we appeared to have some snow last night, but this morning it was all gone already

[10:45] <lizmat> but it *is* sunny atm  :-)

[10:46] <nine> Well it is an ephemeral beauty at 2.7 degrees

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: 

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: The bind-will-resume-on-failure syscall could give a false negative when

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: between the frame record and the bind control record the syscall was looking

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: for a start region record was encountered. This led to multi dispatch failures.

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: Fix by using the new MVM_callstack_prev_significant_record function which

[11:59] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_unwind_missing_frame: ignores region records.

[13:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_uninitialized_reg_after_pea_and_inlining: The register in question should have been written to by a PHI node and carried

[13:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_uninitialized_reg_after_pea_and_inlining: Fix by copying the dopt_users from the PHIs target to the PHI's sources when

[13:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/fix_uninitialized_reg_after_pea_and_inlining: rewriting returns. This way PEA knows that it has to keep the writer alive.
