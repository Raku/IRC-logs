[03:35] <timo> guardnonzero isn't optimized away in many cases at the moment, even when the op that sets the register that it guards is a literal const_i64
[03:39] <timo> so some wins to be had there when both the const assignment and the guard can go away

[07:22] <Nicholas> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/595643 -- new-disp JIT doing out of bounds reads, causes rakudo build fail.
[07:22] <Nicholas> ASAN doesn't catch this. valgrind does. but you have to know that you want to investigate that build
[07:22] <Nicholas> don't yet know which MoarVM commit cause it, but it's not HEAD

[15:28] <brrt> \o
[15:30] <MasterDuke> look at that, some new problems just crop up probably from new jitting of new-disp and then a wild brrt appears. good timing
[15:30] <brrt> hehe
[15:31] <brrt> just-in-time....
[15:31] <brrt> what issue did you run into
[15:31] <Nicholas> o/
[15:33] <MasterDuke> some new segvs, possibly related to the jitting of sp_dispatch_* and sp_run*
[15:34] <brrt> ah
[15:34] <brrt> and where do I look at them
[15:34] <lizmat> sometimes I wonder if an execution mode that would just inline and jit everything before actually executing anything, would maybe make these searches easier?
[15:35] <brrt> lizmat: one of my long time aims was to have a way to just execute a piece of MoarVM bytecode in the JIT, w/o relying on spesh and making things 'hot'
[15:36] <lizmat> ok, so it's not a crazy idea :-)
[15:36] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/40f08dcf01a7d50a5d33cfc53e640c6928f41d59 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f597e4053cd10d5f1b8aa1515a7aa5ec57dad4a4 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8a34255a357f93644a0801df9bb74eac6f8428b3 are the newest jit-related commits i think
[15:36] <brrt> not at all
[15:36] <brrt> it speaks to the authors inexperience that we don't have such a thing yet :-)
[15:37] <brrt> MasterDuke: I see the stacktraces, I can probably figure out what's going on if I have assembly, though it is a painstaking process :-)
[15:38] <MasterDuke> you don't execute assembly in your head at the speed of the cpu? 
[15:39] * lizmat is reminded about a story about Steve Wozniak in the Apple I days  :-)
[15:41] <brrt> ooh, /me doesn't know the story :-)
[15:42] <brrt> what I mean to say, golf would be highly appreciated, though I will probably look at it, no sooner than tomorrow at the earliest
[15:42] <brrt> and probably later
[15:42] <lizmat> basically, when Steve Jobs and him were working in the Apple I, demoing it to potential investors
[15:42] * brrt is getting 5g on monday
[15:42] <brrt> uhuh
[15:42] <lizmat> it didn't have a BIOS yet, so the first thing Steve Wozniak would be doing when the machine started up, was basically typing in the bios from scratch
[15:43] <lizmat> every once in a while, he'd stop for a moment, and then continue again
[15:43] <lizmat> when asked why, he said: "forward references are a bit more tricky :-)"
[15:44] <brrt> lol
[15:44] <lizmat> note: he would by typing in 6502 machine code, no assembler at that stage yet  :-)
[15:44] <brrt> I almost believe it
[15:45] <lizmat> I couldn't easily find the reference  :-(
[15:47] <lizmat> it rings true to me, as I was able to almost that on a much smaller scale for 8086 code at one point in my life  :-)
[15:48] <lizmat> *do
[15:50] <MasterDuke> https://retrocomputingforum.com/t/woz-and-the-forward-reference/1230
[15:50] * patrickb is unsure whether brrt gets a vaccine shot on monday or faster internet...
[15:51] <brrt> the vaccine :-)
[15:51] <brrt> second shot, in fact
[15:51] <lizmat> MasterDuke: indeed, ok, so paraphrased, but still  :-)
[15:52] <MasterDuke> yeah, pretty close
[15:52] <brrt> neat story
[15:55] <brrt> anyway, I sort of have to be strict; please file an issue with a reproduction and assign it to me, and I'll have a look sometime in the near future :-)
[15:56] <MasterDuke> i haven't been able to repro mine, but maybe dogbert17 can

[16:43] <nine> But the assembly gdb shows me for the point of the segfault doesn't match any of the newly jited instructions. Instead if fits what MVM_jit_emit_guard does. mov TMP1, WORK[obj]; followed by get_spesh_slot TMP2, spesh_idx;
[16:44] <nine> dogbert17: unfortunately that's not much help, since we know nothing about the bad read besides its size

[16:51] <nine> Cool, so I was on the right track after all :) timo: did my findings help?
[16:54] <timo> it was nicholas' valgrind output that told me
[16:58] <timo> i hope i didn't force you onto a long goose chase
[17:22] <nine> Not really
[17:23] <nine> Had rr in a loop while under the shower. A watchpoint on the bytecode itself revealed which frame the bytecode was part of. And finding the guard wasn't that hard, since dereferencing the same register 3 times in a row happens probably only when reading spesh slots and there's only the one place that reads a spesh slot into rdx

[21:44] <timo> so that'll be an easy fix

[22:26] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: nqp::istype?  That's used a *lot*.  (So far) it seems to be the fastest way to inspect arbitrary data structures by a fairly large margin, and is thus used by both JSON::Fast and CBOR::Simple.
[22:28] <japhb> Though perhaps that advantage will be smaller in new-disp, since the only reason not to use `when SomeType` is that a couple layers of overhead swamp the actual istype cost.
[22:28] <japhb> (But it eventually ends up just doing that.)
[22:29] <japhb> (Er, and I'm assuming new-disp will reduce that overhead.)
[22:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: nqp::istype won't go away, it just needs re-working to not depend on legacy method caches
[22:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Code using it shouldn't need any changes or notice any differences.
[22:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Other than maybe a speedup in the case that it's non-nominal
[22:39] <timo> oh, do we get speedup for Any.isa(Str:D)?
[22:40] <timo> based on dispatchers?
[22:40] <timo> might be possible, haven't written any dispatchers yet so not entirely certain
[22:42] <timo> i guess we can guard on the exact type passed and when it matches return true otherwise dispatch to a more complicated implementation that walks the inheritance hierarchy and grabs names from types
