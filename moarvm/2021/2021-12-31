[09:38] <nine> I usually inject nqp::sin_i(1e0) to have something to break on :)

[10:08] *** reportable6 joined
[10:09] <nine> Plot twist! This _is_ actually correct:

[10:09] <nine> m: my uint @a; note(@a[0] = -1);

[10:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar a10042dd9: OUTPUT: «-1␤»

[10:11] <nine> Because assignment is supposed to return the assignee unmodified. The test failed due to a bug in the native array postcircumfix candidate for assignment: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/native_array.pm6#L3751

[10:13] <nine> The last expression (and thus return value) is the nqp::bindpos_* op. But this op doesn't actually have a return value! So the thing we return is the last evaluated expression with an actual return value, which happens to be the assignee we pass to the bindpos op.

[10:14] <nine> So all good then? Unfortunately not. Because we don't pass assignee entirely unmodified. Instead it is unboxed to what the bindpos op wants as an argument. And this is how -1 gets turned into 18446744073709551615 which is then returned

[10:14] <lizmat> ok, so does this need fixing in Rakudo or in MoarVM ?>

[10:14] <nine> Fix is trivial in rakudo. Just need to return assignee explicitly

[10:14] <lizmat> ok, will do that

[10:14] <nine> And withthat: All tests successful!

[10:14] <nine> lizmat: I already did locally

[10:14] <lizmat> in the generator ?

[10:15] <nine> yes

[10:15] <lizmat> ok

[10:15] <lizmat> nine++

[10:15] *** linkable6 left
[10:16] <nine> Finally a working state that treats unsigneds as unsigneds (mostly). There are a few unsigned op variants missing and still a quite a few bugs in unsigned handling, but we now have a basis for actually fixing them, since Rakudo now usually knows whether something is supposed to be signed or not.

[10:17] <MasterDuke> up to new-disp-level amount of code changes?

[10:17] <nine> It's probably gonna take me another week to untangle my local changes and put them into proper commits though :( Unfortunately there's no easy step by step conversion. Even getting rakudo to build required loads of changes.

[10:19] <MasterDuke> huh. usually for such a simple script, holding down enter to `next` through rr gets somewhere pretty quickly. maybe because i have profiling active, but i broke on my syscall and still haven't hit that BOOTTrack error

[10:19] <nine> Total: 105 files changed, 4620 insertions(+), 1355 deletions(-)

[10:19] <MasterDuke> oof

[10:19] <nine> Just to fix a single test in a single ecosystem module :D

[10:20] *** sena_kun left
[10:20] <MasterDuke> bonus though, get a bunch of nyi spectests to pass also?

[10:21] <MasterDuke> i wonder if it would be quicker if i disabled spesh

[10:25] *** sena_kun joined
[10:27] <nine> Yes, a few todos now pass. And more should now be easy to fix

[10:41] <lizmat> nine: would it help if I already fixed the nqp::bindpos_* issue ?

[11:23] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/fix_unsigned: 33 commits pushed by (Stefan Seifert)++

[11:23] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/fix_unsigned: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/fccd88a5c373^...1ab4057d1053

[11:33] <lizmat> I'll take that as a no  :-)

[11:33] <nine> Well, err...no :)

[11:35] <lizmat> well, it looks like returning an atposref_x breaks a few spectest I just saw

[11:35] <lizmat> but first /me is going for the last bicycle ride of the year: must make it to 10500+ km :-)

[11:36] <lizmat> afk&

[16:16] <nine> wait....10500? I thought the goal was 10000? :)

[16:17] <lizmat> ah... that was already reached a few weeks ago  :-)

[16:34] <Nicholas> nine: NQP passes tests with your branch on ppc64. If you have endian-related bugs, you've hidden them well...

[16:35] <Nicholas> Guten Rutsch, #moarvm

[16:35] <Nicholas> (I believe that this conformes to the good,* * template)

[16:35] <nine> Ebenfalls!

[16:36] <lizmat> "een goeien roetsj" it's called in local plat  :-)

[16:37] <Nicholas> "tsj" is not a combination of letters that I am familar with

[16:39] <lizmat> the "roetsj" is pronounced the same way as "Rutsch"  :-)   maybe just a tiny bit longer...

[22:03] <[Coke]> lizmat++ #goals

[22:03] <[Coke]> my goal has been: make it to the new year. Almost there.

[22:04] <[Coke]> need to set sights higher in 2022.

[22:20] <vrurg> "Today's agenda: 1. Make a TODO list – done!"

[22:21] <[Coke]> :)

[22:35] <japhb> Technically, making it to the new year is a much bigger goal on January 1 than it is on December 31, so you can reuse the wording and just change the target year.  :-)
