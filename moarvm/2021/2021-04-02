[08:36] <nwc10> Good Friday, #moarvm

[10:30] <dogbert11> good afternoon

[10:49] <dogbert11> regarding the SEGV that nwc10 found, all I can see is that when running the loop which evaluates the guards, the following seems to happen:

[10:49] <dogbert11> current_node  agn->op

[10:49] <dogbert11> 0             MVM_SPESH_GUARD_OP_CALLSITE

[10:49] <dogbert11> 2             MVM_SPESH_GUARD_OP_LOAD_ARG

[10:49] <dogbert11> 3             MVM_SPESH_GUARD_OP_STABLE_TYPE

[10:49] <dogbert11> 4             MVM_SPESH_GUARD_OP_LOAD_ARG

[10:49] <dogbert11> 5             MVM_SPESH_GUARD_OP_STABLE_CONC  # SEGV here at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/arg_guard.c#L496

[10:53] <dogbert11> nwc10, nine: is the above something which makes sense?

[11:21] <nine> dogbert11: I think the segfault happens because that LOAD_ARG step loads a NULL, right?

[11:35] <dogbert11> nine: I think so if my debug printf's are correct :)

[11:38] <dogbert11> I don't know how to get backwards from this point though

[11:40] <nine> rr?

[11:41] <nine> Where would it load that arg from?

[11:43] *** linkable6 left
[11:45] *** linkable6 joined
[12:00] <dogbert11> nine: sadly I can't use rr, last time I checked Virtualbox didn't support it :(

[12:01] <dogbert11> nine: your services is in high demand today :)

[12:02] <dogbert11> s/is/are/

[12:07] <nine> you have no idea...

[12:12] <MasterDuke> good friday

[12:14] *** brrt joined
[12:14] <brrt> \o

[12:16] <dogbert11> hello brrt and MasterDuke

[12:19] <brrt> ohai dogbert11

[12:27] <dogbert11> brrt, anything interesting going on?

[12:28] <dogbert11> nine: could the following tail end of the spesh log give any further clues? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/1f3da75c3b5b290f66726601f50a62e2

[12:28] <MasterDuke> especially now that our CI is being worked on, it'd be nice to get some extra kinds of testing added (e.g., run some stuff with --full-cleanup under valgrind to detect if we add any new leaks)

[12:30] <nine> gotta go

[12:33] <brrt> dogbert11: not really

[12:41] *** linkable6 left
[12:43] <lizmat> feels like there's still a gremlin in the import process

[12:44] <lizmat> t/spec/S11-modules/import-multi.rakudo.t just flapped for me in test 6

[12:44] *** linkable6 joined
[12:49] <MasterDuke> well https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1454 is now green, because i reran one of the windows pipelines and t/02-rakudo/repl.t apparently is a flapper (maybe just on windows?)

[12:50] *** linkable6 left
[12:51] <lizmat> ok, so merge that and bump MoarVM / NQP ?

[12:53] *** linkable6 joined
[12:53] <MasterDuke> i wouldn't necessarily say it deserves/requires a bump, but sure

[12:54] *** linkable6 left
[12:55] *** linkable6 joined
[12:58] <MasterDuke> i also wouldn't object if someone gave it a once over

[12:58] <MasterDuke> i'm pretty sure it's correct in that it doesn't do anything wrong, but maybe there's more it could do

[13:00] *** linkable6 left
[13:02] *** linkable6 joined
[13:05] <lizmat> ah... ok, not much happened since the last bump

[13:06] <lizmat> well, for bisectability I would like to see smaller bumps  :-)

[13:09] <dogbert11> brrt: perhaps something will come up later

[14:58] <brrt> fun

[14:58] <brrt> do they have a different ABI?

[15:01] <dogbert11> brrt: haven't actually read it yet, just noticed it

[18:27] <lizmat> trying to upgrade 'dd' to do this: https://glot.io/snippets/fx9cjgi62o

[18:28] <lizmat> Stage mast       : Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure '' (gen/moar/World.nqp:2597)

[18:28] <lizmat> now, I can put that code into a module, and export the "ic" and it works fine

[18:29] <lizmat> so I'm a bit perplexed it doesn't work (at the end of) the setting

[18:46] <lizmat> t/spec/S11-modules/import-multi.rakudo.t just flapped for me in test 6  *again*

[18:48] <lizmat> can't reproduce outside of spectest :(

[18:58] *** zakharyas joined
[19:34] <MasterDuke> don't think i've ever seen that one flap

[19:42] <MasterDuke> lizmat: btw, re the "Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure" i assume you've seenhttps://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2021-04-02#l83 ?

[19:51] <[Coke]> jnthn: would you like someone to remove the "email you about moarvm" note in the readme?

[20:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: coke++ created pull request #1455: Minor README updates

[20:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1455

[20:04] <nine> dogbert11: oh, it looks like that spesh segfault is already fixed by my various_fixes branch :)

[20:04] <nine> I guess it's about time to merge that

[20:04] <nine> Funny how a week after I did that another case pops up where the mis-spesh leads to NULLs in registers

[20:08] <dogbert11> nine: that sounds like very good news indeed

[21:21] <jnthn> [Coke]: hah, that has probably been there from the start. I don't really mind in so far as pretty much nobody does...but yeah, given they're likely to get a more timely response on IRC, it's probably a better experience :)
