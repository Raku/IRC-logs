[06:41] <nwc10> ibm-- # needs cookies to render plain pages. Mmm, cookies.

[06:42] <nwc10> mmm, I wonder if that is GDPR compliant.

[06:43] <moritz> only if that cookie doesn't store any PII

[06:43] <nwc10> I guess they condier it "strictly necessary" bceause they've (mis)constructed it to *be* strictly necessary

[06:47] <nine> I bet this isn't malice but a side effect of using some arcane Enterprise Java Enterprise Content Management System, Enterprise edition

[06:47] <nine> Developed by people who have never understood the web.

[06:47] <nwc10> I suspect that it isn't malice either, but all the cool tech seems to do it too

[06:47] <nwc10> let's do it client side, in a single threaded language.

[06:48] <nwc10> oh, wait, that was the "and it needs JS" part that I didn't mention

[06:48] <nwc10> but the JS is checking the cookie, not the server.

[06:48] <nine> of course it does, not worth mentioning

[06:57] <nwc10> aha no, if I run the page in a full-on pr0n window with everything enabled, they are trying to show me a GDPR consent popup.

[06:58] <nwc10> Because clearly you *need* all this tracking stuff to render static documentation.

[07:12] <nwc10>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death -- In 2013, an IPv6 version of the ping of death vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft Windows. -- sigh, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it

[07:15] <nwc10> sadly I can't find the story of the how the original Xbox was cracked, as this was a similar "not knowing your history" problem.

[08:05] <nine> I've long wondered about that :)

[08:06] <nwc10> dogbert11: thanks, will watch soon. But there was a lovely written page with about 17 flaws they tried exploiting, and I can't find that currently.

[10:13] <jnthn> This GC bug is taking some finding... It's not fromspace at the point we construct the dispatch program, and I see us write barrier it too

[10:15] <nwc10> rr?

[10:15] <nwc10> tea?

[10:15] <nwc10> lunch?

[10:21] <jnthn> Aha! Added in checking if the static frame we use as the root is really the one that owns the inline cache entry. Guess what? It's wrong.

[10:21] <jnthn> So we're doing the write barrier...on the wrong root.

[10:22] <nwc10> oh my. Recent commit at fault? or old?

[10:22] <nwc10> and is it a pattern? (if "might be", I'll try to have a look for more, once you've pushed it, *and* I've got time)

[10:22] <jnthn> Well, it's about the inline cache, so recent as in "part of new-disp"

[10:23] <jnthn> May be much more recent though; I wonder if I could have confused the applicable static frame when I put in the "bind failure becomes resume" mechanism a while back

[10:28] <jnthn> It ain't, apparently

[10:29] <jnthn> I put the did the same check in at the entry to recording a dispatch program and it triggers on the typical code path for recording dispatches

[10:30] <jnthn> Ah bollocks, looks like copy pasta from months ago

[10:31] <nwc10> we're having pasta for lunch, but fortunately not recycled

[10:32] <jnthn> Yup, that was it

[10:35] <nwc10> \o/

[10:37] <timotimo> always impressed to see how low-powered these consoles all were

[10:42] <timotimo> in terms of clock frequencies of the CPUs, though of course comparing powerpc with x86 isn't 1:1, but also the amount of RAM they had was so low

[10:43] <nwc10> yes

[10:46] <jnthn> No geth, but the fix is pushed, along with some GC debug checks to catch any similar accidents in the future

[10:47] <jnthn> And `make spectest` still looking good with it enabled.

[10:48] <jnthn> So I guess that means I've fixed all the known broken and after lunch it really will be time to break more things :)

[10:48] <lizmat> .oO( that's very raku of you )

[10:49] <timotimo> the wii homebrew channel song that plays when you open the "channel" on the UI is really catchy

[10:50] <timotimo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLDlWNDmR8k this full version has an additional 20 seconds of intro / buildup before the point you'd get when you turned it on on the console

[10:56] <timotimo> i wonder why rakudo doesn't play catchy music when you start it

[10:57] <lizmat> [12:51:00]  <lizmat>	not sure, you should probably ask that on #moarvm  :-)

[10:57] <lizmat> [12:55:23]  <demostanis[m]>	I still can't post in there with matrix

[10:57] <lizmat> the question was:

[10:58] <lizmat> [12:49:44]  <demostanis[m]>	Oh ok, is there anything on the MoarVM website which says which key the binary is signed with?

[11:01] <lizmat> jnthn sena_kun ^^  just now on #raku

[11:02] <sena_kun> lizmat, yup, saw that, was not sure what to answer. I think it's a lack on the website code. It does not even provide a button to download the .asc, even though we properly upload it.

[11:05] <sena_kun> I also wonder what the request is about, to add something like "This RSA key was used to sign packages"? But if it's compromised it means such a label can be replaced as well.

[11:06] <lizmat> well, /me doesn't know either

[11:53] <nwc10> you make "requirements" sound like it's a 4 letter word. :-/

[12:00] <[Coke]> the business requirements are fine, it's just trying to satisfy all 3 areas.

[13:39] <jnthn> nwc10: hmmm, since that turns out to be on the "legacy" args handling path, I might put that one off to see if the code in question goes away. That said, I'm not really sure how it's happening...

[14:32] <jnthn> Uff, how on earth can giving KnowHOW a find_method method cause breakage...

[14:35] <jnthn> grmbl, I see how

[14:38] <nwc10> because it knows that it is Friday afternoon?

[14:46] <jnthn> $ RAKUDO_NEW_DISP=1 ./rakudo-m -e '42.say'

[14:46] <jnthn> 42

[14:47] <jnthn> Yay. Setting the env var now rewrites callmethod into a dispatch op.

[14:47] <jnthn> So that `42.say` will go via the raku-meth-call dispatcher

[15:19] <jnthn> I suspect this plan of attack will help to figure out some things, but since the way proto subs get compiled is changing, at some point I'll have to bite the bullet and compile even CORE.setting with new-disp too

[15:20] <jnthn> *with RAKUDO_NEW_DISP

[15:58] <nwc10> and $other has calmed me down a bit, so after 3 dry days I'm stopping.

[16:37] <jnthn> Uff, that's...not nicer

[16:38] <nwc10> aye.

[16:38] <nwc10> I'm going to rebuild with valgrind and see if it spots somethign earlier

[16:38] <jnthn> Though also suggests we mighta got "lucky" before that and had a valid pointer

[16:38] <jnthn> The wild pointer one suggests it can be utter junk

[16:38] <nwc10> aye, which makes me hope that valgrind finds something else

[16:39] * jnthn has already moved on to the lighter task of working on one of this month's Comma features

[16:40] <nwc10> I moved onto beer sitting outside. I slack. I'm sorr.

[16:41] <jnthn> That is my plan in about 15 minutes time :)

[16:42] <nwc10> I suspect you've earned it more than me.

[16:44] <jnthn> Guess I can only relax for so long, I'm meant to be cooking dal for dinner.

[16:44] <jnthn> Although the temptation to just have something delivered is non-zero... :)

[16:45] <nwc10> I had suggested this but it was sort-of-vetoed

[16:45] <nwc10> (I am not usually in charge of cooking. But I was considering curry. From the "Italian")

[16:46] <[Coke]> I have noted with $spouse that we seem to eat out a LOT more during these trying times.

[16:46] <[Coke]> (takeout out, not sit down out)

[16:50] *** domidumont left
[16:52] <jnthn> We pretty much replaced the number of times we did sit down out with doing takeout out.

[17:05] <lizmat> the takeout out has more or less remained the same for us, the sit down out is now sit down at home with home cooked meals

[17:06] <nwc10> sorry for bad news, but valgrind doesn't find anything. IIRC one of the poosiblities was that valgrind disabled ASLR, and another was that it ended up with addresses being in the bottom 32 bits

[17:06] <nwc10> I shall have a go with rr, but not right now

[17:07] <nwc10> enjoy whatever food you settle on

[17:08] <jnthn> :)

[17:08] <jnthn> Yeah, I've done the feature I was meant to, so now it's time to rest :)
