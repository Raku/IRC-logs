[11:16] <jnthn> Ohhh. Oh. I think I just discovered a new way to use the dispatcher to do something that I thought would need special handling...without actually needing any special handling.

[11:16] <lizmat_> wow!   :-)

[11:17] <jnthn> For a while I've wondered if we need a mechanism along the lines of "process these arguments in some way and then do the dispatch"

[11:18] <jnthn> It turns out that this is possible already: you 1. create a resumable dispatcher, 2. write the processing logic in a function that resumes with the processed arguments, 3. in the resumption, have the processed arguments and continue

[11:20] <lizmat_> that sounds...   too easy ?

[11:21] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[11:22] <jnthn> I'm not quite sure if I need it right now, but it's a nice pattern to have to hand if I do.

[11:26] <jnthn> lunch, bbiab

[13:53] <jnthn> Hm, I think the trick I mentioned earlier actually *will* come in quite useful in the case that we have arguments that are in a Proxy

[13:53] <jnthn> And need to unwrap them for dispatch purposes
