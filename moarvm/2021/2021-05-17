[08:15] <MasterDuke> ?

[08:17] <nwc10> it solves whatever problem that your branch free_loaded_libs_during_full_cleanup tries to solve

[08:17] <nwc10> but I don't actually know what the problem was

[08:19] <MasterDuke> it was valgrind reporting the 'still reachable' stuff

[10:48] <nwc10> I found that YAML thing hard enough to understand already - I think that it would better to make it "revisionist history" with clean error-free commits (or just one) so that it's less confusing to everyone in the future.

[10:49] <nwc10> "just one" - I didn't actually look (yet) at what you were doing, other than figuring that it was "Trying to make it work"

[11:08] *** frost-lab joined
[11:13] <MasterDuke> hm. so the current ubuntu 16/18 fails are correct. i.e., there are reachable blocks when there shouldn't be, and aren't on the newer OSes

[11:15] <MasterDuke> we could make the test more relaxed (no reachable blocks, or if there are any of those, at least no explicit leaks)? only run the test on the new OSes? someone spin up an ubuntu 16/18 vm and try to debug why the cleanup is failing on them?

[11:16] <nwc10> I think that it's useful to keep the strict "nothing" test for something current

[11:17] <nwc10> I don't know if it's useful to test the older versions, if trying to test them adds complexity

[11:17] <nwc10> I think that the important one not to regress on is the "nothing" one

[11:23] <MasterDuke> i can add a 'CHECK_LEAKS' variable to the CI pipeline and only set that for some of the jobs
