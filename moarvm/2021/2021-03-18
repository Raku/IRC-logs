[15:40] <MasterDuke> jnthn, lizmat: any suggestions re https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/74 ?

[15:40] <jnthn> And I thought dispatch in Raku was an effort... https://2021.programming-conference.org/details/MoreVMs-2021-papers/4/The-Strange-and-Wondrous-Life-of-Functions-in-

[15:42] <moritz>  jnthn: wow, what a gem!

[15:50] <MasterDuke> running the examples in https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/optimizing-reading-lines-from-a-file/ with the file used in https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/74, i get 0.29s for perl and 0.47 for raku (at moarmv/nqp/rakudo HEAD)

[16:24] *** brrt joined
[16:24] <MasterDuke> but running the perl version in https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/74 only takes 1.2s for me compared to 9.5s for the equivalent raku version

[16:27] <MasterDuke> and yeah, wow, i had no idea function calling in r was that complicated

[16:39] <nine> That reads like someone really tried to make function calls as hard as possible :D

[16:50] <MasterDuke> running the perl version but opening as utf-8 slows it to 1.95s

[16:57] <MasterDuke> oh right, this is where perf says MVM_multi_cache_find_callsite_args is the most expensive moarvm function
