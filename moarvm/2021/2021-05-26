[07:15] <nine> moon-child: that's assuming it will fail the same way in rr. But yes, many failures actually do, even if I've got a few that didn't lately. But rr can also fill up your disk. Just something to be aware of

[19:09] <samcv> it seems I found a bug in the ShiftJIS decoder (prompted by reviewing https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1498). It looks like if we: 1. are using a replacement on decoder error 2. the last character before the error is \r; then we will lose the \r

[20:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: precisely in the moment that the task's frame walker is processing
[20:56] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: this frame. When exiting we also clean up the frame extras which
