[12:53] <tbrowder> given some of the outstanding (some very old) issues, what about starting some local tests for them in this repo?

[12:56] <tbrowder> we could use Raku and native call

[20:26] <nine> tbrowder: I'm not sure I'm following you

[20:29] <tbrowder> take for example the function in pr 1498. so far no one is sure if the uninitiated value can cause a problem.

[20:30] <tbrowder> couldn't we design a test to check it out?

[20:31] <tbrowder> the Raku and nativecall bit was just a thought about test implementation

[20:32] <tbrowder> i looked briefly at the nqp tests for moar but i'm just exploring...
