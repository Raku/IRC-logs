[16:27] <nine> dogbert17: not zet

[16:29] <nine> ...until now that is

[16:54] <dogbert17> nine++, that's excellent news

[16:56] <nine> So far it has eluded rr though

[16:56] <dogbert17> I thought you had given up on rr

[16:59] *** discord-raku-bot left
[17:00] <nine> Why would I?

[17:02] <nine> If an error is reproducible in rr, that's certainly preferrable to doing it the old fashioned way. It's just some errors where there doesn't seem to be a chance for rr

[17:03] <dogbert17> I see, so it's on a bug by bug basis then

[18:27] <dogbert17> so it plays elusive

[20:31] <nine> But then, the same is true for running it in gdb

[20:32] *** discord-raku-bot left
[20:33] <dogbert17> FWIW: the panic always seem to appear after all the tests have been run

[20:33] <nine> true

[20:34] <dogbert17> and it is always trying to find the method !cursor_init

[20:34] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[20:36] <nine> Maybe it's actually about Log::Async

[20:37] <nine> anyway gotta go to bed now
