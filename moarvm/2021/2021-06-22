[09:41] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: i remember in college wondering if that would work if we got some of the kits to make them yourselves, like our parents made for us with fruit juice as kids. we thought you'd have to have so little alcohol as to not be worth it

[09:41] <MasterDuke> what's the ABV of the ones you found?

[15:45] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/new-disp: We'll allow languages so specify their standard call and method call

[15:50] <Nicholas> jnthnwrthngtn: MoarVM panic: Fixed size allocator: wrong size in free: expected 64, got 8

[15:50] <Nicholas> Aborted

[15:50] <Nicholas> that's NQP on bfcce46e597a5620bf8b64836e36c2c99869b038

[15:50] <Nicholas> MoarVM on 5bcb87516f1e218769be411395c2f5eaa5a2c167

[15:51] <Nicholas> +#define FSA_SIZE_DEBUG 1

[15:51] <Nicholas> (etc)

[15:55] <MasterDuke> "although in principle anything" ... oooh, MoarVM eventually gains GraalVM-like multi-lang interoperability...

[15:57] <Nicholas> but with less startup overhead?

[15:59] <MasterDuke> hopefully. though the native images you can build with it start up incredibly quickly

[16:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: Regression, or just how it is?

[16:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> Will try and repro in a moment

[16:07] <Nicholas> "not know" - I think that it used to pass, but it's a different machine from yesterday (1 debian version earlier, but otherwise I think identical setup)

[16:07] <Nicholas> but might be a regression since yesterday

[16:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> Interop is really hard even when one is designing a language with it in mind from the start. I recently tracked down a resource leak that occurred in some Kotlin code because it was passing a Kotlin lambda, stored in a field, to a Java function. Since the lambda was in a field it should pass the same object each time, no? Apparently not; it wraps it on the interop boundary. The Java code was using the object

[16:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> identity of the thing passed to in order to keep track of handlers it needed to add/remove, but the interop wrappings were distinct objects. Oops.

[16:12] <nine> Ah, yes, interop. Always fun :D

[18:34] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: 6% ABV

[18:58] <MasterDuke> interesting, surprised it's that high

[21:13] <Nicholas> jnthnwrthngtn: I am getting different results on different machines. I believe that the only thing that differs is debian version. So clearly I have something wrong, as this can't explain the panic.

[21:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: No, hmm, that one I'd expect to be consistent

[21:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> Nicholas: I did a rebase and force push of all the branches yesterday; I don't suppose it could be some accident around that?

[21:16] <Nicholas> no, I have the same commit hash for NQP and MoarVM on both. The same diff for MoarVM on both  (all the debug stuff) and I think the same MVM_ exports in the environment

[21:19] <jnthnwrthngtn> OK, then it's weird.

[21:19] <Nicholas> Yes, totally agree. I need to go to sleep, and look at this with a fresh head.

[21:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> Rest well

[21:22] <Nicholas> Um, it's not yet actually "good morning", but

[21:22] <Nicholas> ==6252== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

[21:22] <Nicholas> ==6252==    at 0x4A4DDCB: MVM_spesh_log_is_logging (log.h:30)

[21:22] <Nicholas> ==6252==    by 0x4A65ABF: MVM_interp_run (interp.c:3154)

[21:22] <Nicholas> ==6252==    by 0x109A43: main (main.c:305)

[21:22] <MasterDuke> jnthnwrthngtn: now might not be the best time, but https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1426 could use a final review at some point

[21:22] <Nicholas> that was

[21:22] <Nicholas> valgrind '/home/nick/Sandpit/moar-g/bin/moar' --libpath=src/vm/moar/stage0 src/vm/moar/stage0/nqp.moarvm --bootstrap --setting-path=gen/moar/stage1 --module-path=gen/moar/stage1 --no-regex-lib --target=mbc --setting=NQPCORE --stable-sc=stage1 --output=gen/moar/stage1/QRegex.moarvm gen/moar/stage1/QRegex.nqp

[21:23] <Nicholas> that doesn't seem great.

[21:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> grmbl, my ability to reproduce it ain't either

[21:28] <Nicholas> I still fail to go to bed. I should. You should too, when you're ready. Let me figure this one out, but it might take a day or two. I'm not yet "shot" of the other job.

[21:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh, I managed it.

[21:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> With blocking + nodelay

[21:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm mildly confused how this happens in an NQP build where new-disp isn't used yet and so in theory "nothing changed"

[21:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Though fair warning: very soon everything is about to change, probably in a "breaking stuff for a while" way (I really need to get NQP shoved over to new-disp before I make more progress on that for Rakudo)
