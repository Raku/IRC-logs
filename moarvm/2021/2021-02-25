[09:26] <MasterDuke> it's interesting, on my remove_candidates branch heaptrack shows 20m more calls to allocation functions and 4.7m more temporary allocations, but peak heap and rss are almost identical

[09:27] <MasterDuke> so just a lot more churn, but not more memory being used in total

[11:41] <MasterDuke> oh, valgrind (and heaptrack) show a leak on my branch, haven't figured out what's leaking yet. https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/428539a1b1d2581a5d42bd171b92ff5b

[13:07] <MasterDuke> ok, removing isn't the problem, it leaks even if no candidates are ever removed

[13:19] <MasterDuke> well, i added what i believe was a missing free of `cands_and_arg_guards->spesh_candidates` in MVMStaticFrameSpesh.c's gc_free, but still the same leak

[15:05] <nwc10> it is sunny outside. I'm going back outside

[15:06] <nwc10> (just popping inside to collect some inspiration from the beer fridge)

[15:06] <nwc10> it is sunny "this week"

[15:09] *** brrt left
[15:26] <MasterDuke> it is the remove_candidates branch that introduces the leak, it's not there on master
