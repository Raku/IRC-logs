[06:56] <Nicholas> good *, #moarvm 

[06:56] <Nicholas> nine: I think currently I'd view myself as "stuck".

[06:56] <Nicholas> Report is:

[06:57] <Nicholas> on master (strictly, the parent of the merge, so that it's the last master commit before new-disp-nativecall)

[06:58] <Nicholas> in MVM_nativecall_invoke, the memory at the pointer in the assignment `MVMNativeCallBody *body = MVM_nativecall_get_nc_body(tc, site);`

[06:58] <Nicholas> comes directly from MVM_nativecall_build

[07:00] <Nicholas> whereas in the first commit of new-disp-nativecall, b7d40359a1503dda41e8592297d305ea7b1f2ba5, that memory has been (incompletely) copied by copy_to in src/6model/reprs/NativeCall.c

[07:01] <Nicholas> and I don't spot a clean way to fix copy_to to work with both layouts. Or really, *what* needs copying, and how. (But I guess I figure that out by looking to see what gets freed when you deallocate a NativeCall thingy.)

[11:16] <timo> jnthnwrthngtn: do you have a suggestion for how to handle that callsites don't have a flag for "coderef" for the proposed "collect-coderefs-into-array" or whatever syscall?

[11:17] <timo> the validator wouldn't be able to verify unless it special-cases the op, or if there's a flag for syscalls "only"

[11:20] <timo> it could use integers as indices into the codes table or something

[11:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hm, it's not actually such a good saving really because arguments always have to go into registers

[11:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Even literal ones

[12:45] <jnthnwrthngtn> Perhaps we need an X::NonResumable role with a method resume that dies, and to apply it to various things (probably including X::Comp).

[12:46] <jnthnwrthngtn> In theory we may be able to actually make method not found resumable now, but I'm not sure we should.

[12:50] <lizmat> why not?  have it return Nil as if .?method ?

[12:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> Feel free to try and implement it, if you think it's worth it.

[12:54] <jnthnwrthngtn> I suspect the typical consequence of resuming will be that the code that did the method call won't handle the situation too.

[12:56] <lizmat> hmmm..   well, if you have the CATCH in place to resume it, then you're sorta expecting it?

[12:56] <lizmat> I mean, there is overhead involved with .?method, right

[12:56] <lizmat> it would be a way to not have that overhead in the cases where it has the method?

[12:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> The overhead of .?method is going to be vastly lower than going through the exception system.

[12:57] <lizmat> but the overhead of .?method would be for every call, even the successful ones, no?

[14:02] <Nicholas> nine: effectively I'm sort-of-stuck. I have a question at the end of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/26068a0440

[14:07] <nine> Nicholas: oh, sorry. It's pretty safe to ignore that particular test. It requires fully working manage-explicitly support which didn't appear until some time later (and requires cooperation between rakudo and MoarVM). Indeed I discovered that this was broken even pre-new-disp.

[14:07] *** TempIRCLogger left

[14:11] <Nicholas> OK. I might get a chance to get back to this in I guess about 4 hours

[14:18] <gfldex> If .resume would take an argument that is used as the failed expressions return value, one could actually handle this case (any like many other cases).

[14:23] <lizmat> gfldex: nqp::setpayload($!ex,value) in Exception.resume ?

[14:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> fwiw, I think the next thing I'll take on is the LEAVE and friends situation (from the point of view of efficiency and also fixing the odd disappearing return value bug I uncovered a while back)

[14:32] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: bump MoarVM in the interest of testing and bisectability ?

[14:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> lizmat: I think you asked earlier and I agreed? :)

[14:33] <lizmat> oops, missed that  :-)

[14:33] <lizmat> going to do it now

[14:33] <jnthnwrthngtn> Anyway, said next thing will probably be for next week. I've got a rough sketch of a plan for it

[14:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> Basically, just emit code to run all of the exit phasers ahead of the (MoarVM) return op, so in a normal return they just run as normal code, and then identify the location of them within the block (handler style) for the unwind case.

[14:35] <nine> So far all I've apparently managed is to make it less common. I've also tried moving the first find_interned_callsite call to after we've taken the lock and as expected that makes the problem go away.

[14:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> Which will mean we also get inlining of them anyway.

[14:54] <dogbert17> nine: is this the place of the SEGV? 2944                 if (STABLE(val.o) != (MVMSTable *)dp->gc_constants[op.arg_guard.checkee])

[14:54] <nine> dogbert17: yes

[14:55] <nine> dogbert17: well for one of the two I see. The more frequent one is in find_interned_callsite

[14:58] <lizmat> fwiw, I can not just restart applications after the bump  :-(

[14:59] <lizmat> Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp' (from 'site#sources/45334C557865A97D1ECA0D3F3A3FAF2017FCE553 (OO::Monitors)')

[14:59] <lizmat> always OO::Monitors  :-(

[15:00] <lizmat> installing / uninstalling OO::Monitors does not fix :-(

[15:01] <lizmat> uninstalling Cro::HTTP 

[15:02] <lizmat> installing Cro::HTTP fails with: Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp' (from 'site#sources/45334C557865A97D1ECA0D3F3A3FAF2017FCE553 (OO::Monitors)')

[15:02] <lizmat> am I really the only one suffering from this ?

[15:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> I've not seen it, fwiw

[15:03] <vrurg_> lizmat: not this time, but sometimes it happens. Never in time for me to be able to trace it down.

[15:03] <vrurg_> I usually just reinstall. Modules too.

[15:05] <vrurg_> Feels like under some conditions modules are not recompiled and the bytecode remains bound to the previous NQPHLL. But this is only a feeling, no proofs.

[15:05] <lizmat> it's bloody annoying  :-(

[15:17] <lizmat> looks like nuking all precomp dirs is a solution

[15:18] <nine> We shouldn't even find precomp files that are bound to outdated NQP modules as we're managing precomp files by compiler-id. And the compiler-id is derived from a sha1 of rakudo's sources and NQP's id which in turn is a sha1 of its sources.

[15:18] <lizmat> well, that's the theory

[15:18] <lizmat> practice is different, for me at least

[15:19] <lizmat> the odd thing is, is that it always seem to center around OO::Monitors

[15:19] <nine> It's only gonna stop once someone digs down into it instead of deleting the evidence

[15:19] <lizmat> true

[15:19] <lizmat> is there a precompilation dir sanity tool ?

[15:23] *** [Coke] left
[15:29] <nine> Well there's at least one (minor) issue: _all_sources in tools/lib/NQP/Config/Rakudo.pm only looks for .nqp and .pm6 files which doesn't cover src/core.c/ParallelSequence.rakumod. _all_sources is used to find the things we need to sha1

[15:30] <lizmat> ok, that should be easily fixed

[15:31] <nine> lizmat: do you use any -j option when building rakudo?

[15:32] <lizmat> no

[15:32] <lizmat> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --make-install

[15:32] <lizmat> is what I use

[15:36] <vrurg_> Rakudo build doesn't parallelize anyway.

[15:37] <vrurg_> I mean, .NOTPARALLEL is in action.

[15:37] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[15:39] <nine> Boy this stuff changed a whole lot since I wrote it. One thing seems definitely odd to me: the calculation of the source digest (which includes gen/nqp-version) got moved to this NQP::Config::Rakudo module which suggest that it's run as part of Configure.pl.

[15:39] <nine> But if that is so, how could it pick up changes since Configure.pl ran?

[15:40] <lizmat> aha... the plot thickens ?

[15:40] <lizmat> otoh, I've only seen this problem *after* a new Confiigure.pl

[15:41] <nine> If this source digest is calculated before Configure.pl updates NQP, then it won't pick up changes in NQP either. I think you are kinda special by relying on --gen-moar. I always update and install the 3 repos manually

[15:42] <lizmat> well, that's one of the reasons I keep using that, as that is the "user" way if building Rakudo  :-)

[15:57] *** [Coke] joined
[16:03] <nine> I think I know what's going on with find_interned_callsite. It's quite devious actually. If I'm correct, the segfaults I see now only appear with a --valgrind build of MoarVM. That's because with that option the FSA pre- and postfixes allocations with some red zone bytes. MVM_FSA_REDZONE_BYTES is defined to be 4. So all pointer arrays allocated with the FSA will be misaligned.

[16:04] <nine> That's why we only read half the pointer. The other half may not be written yet as atomicity of pointer writes can only be expected for properly aligned pointers.

[16:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> omg

[16:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> That's both feasible and terrible

[16:08] <nine> I've checked. The array is unaligned. I've now changed MVM_FSA_REDZONE_BYTES to 8 and running it again. So far no trouble

[16:08] <nine> And yes, terrible indeed

[16:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> So this was, after all, perhaps not the real problem?

[16:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> (Although I think there was actually a risk that the PR I did solves)

[16:09] <nine> Well you may have fixed the real problem already.

[16:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah

[16:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, the PR makes CI happy at least...but that may be luck given it failed rarely

[16:10] <nine> I guess I should try to reproduce the problem without your fix but with my red zone adjustment. But for now my waterrower calls and then dinner

[16:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> Enjoy :)

[17:23] <timo> could be you need to explicitly Configure.pl so that the --version we report really changes?

[17:23] <timo> for the problem liz has with modules

[17:24] <timo> i see you already figured that part out

[17:25] <lizmat> fwiw, I haven't seen the issue since https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e98e17da7d

[17:26] <lizmat> sanity check: if I have a *lot* of objects with an int64 attribute, if I replace that by an int32 attribute, would I save memory 4 bytes / object?

[17:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Maybe not, because of alignment rules

[17:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> If you had two 64-bit attributes one after another and both became int32, yes, that's certainly a saving

[17:30] <lizmat> yeah I feared as much

[17:30] <lizmat> so that's one optimization out of the window  :-)

[17:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> This is why things like the heap snapshot analyzer do the inside-out pattern
