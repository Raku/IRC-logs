[09:51] <nine> Yeah, *able6 is what we have most of here...

[09:53] <MasterDuke> who need people when we have useful bots?

[10:01] <MasterDuke> shouldn't https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1344/files#diff-651fd580717e78e6edebd0e8bca68377ec2f665d843c91b180dc75f45e3230cbR354 come after https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1344/files#diff-651fd580717e78e6edebd0e8bca68377ec2f665d843c91b180dc75f45e3230cbR365-R366 ? it's in the same order as before converting to a REPR, but especially now

[10:01] <MasterDuke> that we're going to be removing things, isn't that unsafe?

[10:10] *** MasterDuke left
[10:20] *** MasterDuke joined
[10:35] <MasterDuke> interesting. at local HEAD (so adding in the removing of spesh candidates) now get a segv in deopt_frame, from `f->static_info->body.bytecode` where is f->static_info is 0x0

[10:39] <MasterDuke> oh

[10:41] <MasterDuke> in MVM_spesh_deopt_one it's in the `if (f->spesh_cand) {` branch calling deopt_frame. but then in deopt_frame it's in the else of `if (f->spesh_cand && f->spesh_cand->body.inlines) {` and when the segv happens, not only is f->static_info 0x0, but so is f->spesh_cand

[10:43] <MasterDuke> ah, well the entire *f is 0xo

[10:46] <MasterDuke> but one level back in the backtrace (MVM_spesh_deopt_one) `*tc->cur_frame` (which is the f passed to deopt_frame) is not 0x0

[11:09] *** avar left
[11:09] *** avar joined
[11:49] <nine> MasterDuke: in what way would it be usafe? There shouldn't be anything different for adding candidates should there?

[11:53] <MasterDuke> well, jnthn recommended doing roughly the same thing in MVM_spesh_candidate_discard_one. move `spesh->body.spesh_cands_and_arg_guards     = new_cands_and_arg_guards;` to after `MVM_spesh_arg_guard_regenerate(tc, &(new_cands_and_arg_guards->spesh_arg_guard), new_cands_and_arg_guards->spesh_candidates, new_num);`

[11:54] <MasterDuke> which i believe fixed a segv (and left me with the invalid GC-owner panic)

[11:56] <MasterDuke> though now i'm getting a segv, maybe because of fixing the missing MVMROOT (one of the recent commits to the PR)?

[11:57] <MasterDuke> btw, merging that PR would make things a bit more convenient for me. i could create a new branch and PR instead of having some commits on the existing branch i'm being careful not to push. hopefully would make it easier for the rest of you to see the diff and help debug

[11:58] <MasterDuke> do you have any objection to merging it now?

[12:37] *** ggoebel_ left
[12:37] *** ggoebel_ joined
[12:43] <MasterDuke> huh. there's `MVMFrame *f = tc->cur_frame;` at the very beginning of MVM_spesh_deopt_one, but then a bit of a mix of using both `f` and `tc->cur_frame` throughout https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/deopt.c#L280-L309

[12:52] <MasterDuke> ha. here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/deopt.c#L300 `*f ` is 0x0, but `*tc->cur_frame` is just fine

[16:19] <lizmat> yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/02/01/2021-05-gsoc-proposing/

[16:19] <lizmat> looks like the earliest SN9 launch will be on Tue

[16:21] <nine> MasterDuke: merge is ok with me

[16:26] <MasterDuke> nine: cool, thanks

[16:27] *** brrt joined
[16:29] <jnthn> fwiw, new-disp isn't just about multiple dispatch, it's about All The Dispatch :)

[16:30] <nine> And even things we didn't actually use to consider to be dispatch

[16:30] <lizmat> so how would you phrase it ?

[16:32] *** brrt` joined
[16:32] *** brrt left
[16:32] <nwc10> All dispatch | Such unified | Better

[16:33] <nwc10> there, someone on the Internet is wrong. This will need correcting :-)

[16:35] <lizmat> changed it to "all dispatching"

[16:36] <El_Che> I don't see nine in the fosdem schedule

[16:41] <jnthn> "all dispatching" is fine

[16:41] <jnthn> I plan to make a blog post when I get a bit further along

[16:56] <lizmat> that's probably nine is too busy atm to do presentations

[16:56] <MasterDuke> hm. if i "squash and merge" through the github ui, is it going to pull in all the commit messages? or do i manually need to that (or write a comprehensive one in the "extended description" section)?

[16:58] * nine would never trust a web UI with that...

[16:59] <jnthn> I'm pertty sure it doesn't take all the commit messages

[17:00] <MasterDuke> oh! then maybe i'd better manually squash them and massage the commit message(s) and then just do a regular merge

[17:01] <jnthn> To me the retention of commit messages is usually a bit more important than "every commit builds", in that git bissect --first-parent means that we can avoid looking inside of branches and bissect only their merges

[17:02] <brrt`> huh, no idea it worked that way

[17:03] <MasterDuke> hm, wonder if that would be a good thing to implement for bisectable6

[17:05] *** brrt` is now known as brrt

[17:06] <MasterDuke> like i mentioned in a comment on the PR, i wish there was a way to attach messages to individual parts of a larger diff that don't really make sense as a comment. i.e., they're about the change in the code, not the final state

[20:14] <jnthn> MasterDuke++ # yay

[20:22] <lizmat> MasterDuke: time to bump MoarVM?

[20:23] <MasterDuke> lizmat: sure. the changes shouldn't be visible to nqp/rakudo (yet), but it'd be good to get them more testing
