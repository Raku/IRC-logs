[09:17] <jnthn> nwc10: I realized on my walk that a word boundary *does* indeed mean `:tempest;` would no longer be parsed there, but my example with `-` will, 'cus that is a word boundary. So I guess the cunning plan largely survives... :)

[09:21] <nwc10> this was an all-night walk?

[09:22] <nine> those are the best

[09:39] <jnthn> It wasn't, although I'm feeling sleepy enough this morning that it might as well have been...

[09:41] <nwc10> I was like that yesterday. For some reason last night I slept much better

[09:42] <nwc10> but I had this strange dream about getting a replacement passport. From some guy with a big beard. Who did it very quicky. And then I realised that the outer cover was had the wrong language on it. And it was a whole sequence of covers going inwards, each with a different language on it, like it was some do-it-yourself forgery kit.

[09:44] <nine> So....your unconcious expresses doubt towards your passport forger? :D

[09:44] <nwc10> seemingly yes. But this was supposed to be a genine passport. So clearly I was conned

[09:54] <MasterDuke> is a jvm-backeded nqp/rakudo relocatable?

[10:13] *** patrickb joined
[10:16] <patrickb> MasterDuke: JVM has no fancy wrapper programs as MoarVM does, only plain bat/sh scripts with their inherent drawbacks. I think I tried to make them relocatable as well, but I possibly never actually tried.

[10:16] <MasterDuke> cool. we'll see what happens with https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/719
