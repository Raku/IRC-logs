[08:56] <timotimo> morningable

[09:05] <MasterDuke> inarguable

[10:07] <jnthn> morning o/

[10:07] <jnthn> Fresh snow!

[10:08] <nwc10> \o

[10:08] <nwc10> it's just "minus something" here with lots of frost

[10:08] <nwc10> it seems that snow happens to other people

[10:09] <jnthn> I wonder if there's enough on my terrace to make a snowman...

[10:09] <nwc10> I was about to ask *exactly* that

[10:09] <jnthn> ...alas, I've too much work to find out

[10:09] <nwc10> is it the right sort of snow?

[10:09] <jnthn> It looks about right

[10:09] <nwc10> (at least, the easier stuff to roll into balls)

[10:09] <jnthn> I suspect it's a little too thin still

[10:17] <nine> That front should reach us in a few hours. Hope it will bring snow as well and not rain :)

[10:24] <MasterDuke> we have some more snow+rain predicted for next weekend, but i'm not hopeful anything will stick enough to make a snowman

[10:26] <nwc10> aha, strictly the question should have been "right type of snow?" or "right kind of snow?" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_wrong_type_of_snow

[10:27] <nwc10> I *think* that the "wrong type of snow" for rail infrastructure was also the wrong type for making snowmen (problem was that it was very light and powdery)

[10:34] <lizmat> just rain here  :-(

[10:42] <nine> Cool picture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_wrong_type_of_snow#/media/File:158XXX_,_North_Wingfield.jpg

[10:44] <jnthn> Hm, I think that class of train ran through the village where I grew up :)

[11:30] <nine> nwc10: if you're really motivated about fixing stuff on Windows, you can download Windows VMs directly from Microsoft: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/

[11:31] <nwc10> No, I'm really not. And I don't think I actually own anything powerful enough to run one

[11:32] <nwc10> I'm interested in fixing things on *nix and not messing up Win32 in the process.

[11:32] *** sena_kun left
[11:35] <MasterDuke> heh. pretty much exactly how i feel. really hoping someone picks up the building-on-windows part of my gmp PR (the code changes of which are still ripe for reviewing...)

[11:36] <nine> Yeah, I can totally sympathise. Except maybe that I have a bit of a more neutral stance on messing up Win32...

[11:38] <MasterDuke> you don't mind messing up win32?

[11:39] <nine> Let's say I'm not terribly upset if some improvement I make breaks something on Win32 and I have a harder time finding the motivation to fix it than with other regressions. But then I understand that we officially support Windows and will try to do the right thing.

[11:40] *** brrt joined
[11:43] <MasterDuke> well yeah, that's really not too far off how i feel

[12:02] <nine> snow!

[14:56] <brrt> no snow here yet

[14:56] <brrt> there was some talk about a polar vortex collapse

[14:57] <brrt> I will admit to only having the very vaguest idea what that really is

[15:19] <lizmat> having 40+ degrees in summer in Siberia

[15:20] <lizmat> having -30 degrees in Spain in winter

[15:25] <brrt> something like that yes

[15:30] *** sena_kun joined
[15:32] *** Altai-man left
[15:58] <vrurg> lizmat: Siberia is a bad example. They might easily get it up to 40‚Å∞C in summer. It's what might be called 'extreme continental climate'.

[16:08] *** domidumont joined
[16:10] <brrt> well, not usually up to 40C before recently :-)

[19:41] <nine> Fixing the memory leak when the same buffer is passed to nqp::readfh is extremely simple...unless you want to actually harness the efficiency gain of just writing to the same buffer

[19:42] <nine> The latter case is just sooo easy to get wrong
