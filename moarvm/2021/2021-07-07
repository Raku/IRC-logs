[09:50] <lizmat> Running this code with --profile starts to reliably segfault around 22000 for me
[09:50] <lizmat> for ^22000 { next $_ }
[09:50] <lizmat> lower values generally create a profile ok
[09:51] <lizmat> note that this uses the new "next with a value" feature
[09:53] <lizmat> looking at other similar code, it appears to be dependent on the number of times "next $_" is called
[09:58] <lizmat> additional note: the profile generated with the values that won't segfault, is massive (10MB+), which feels to me the problem is in logging "next" itself?
[09:59] <lizmat> hmmm...  "for ^220000 { next }" generates a 4MB profile, which also feels meh
[10:00] <lizmat> so this maybe a more general issue with profiling control exceptions ?

[16:34] <dogbert17> lizmat: did you try with MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1
[16:40] <dogbert17> according to ASAN it's a stack overflow
[16:47] <dogbert17> it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/fd9f22e70875f4deaf91a82c0dbe745d

[17:48] <timo> it's possible the profiler is accidentally making deeper and deeper stacks

[18:20] <timo> i think the slack app on my phone is in a state where exactly one slack just doesn't work properly at all. i don't see new messages, every channel i open just shows the exact same stale messages wtf
