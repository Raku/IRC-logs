[09:07] <MasterDuke> nine: do you not get an error locally with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1511 ?

[09:18] <MasterDuke> i've gotten some random segfaults when building nqp and rakudo with it

[09:28] <MasterDuke> and running rakudo tests, but i haven't been able to catch any in gdb yet

[09:52] <nine> MasterDuke: huh...no, that PR is actually supposed to fix such things :D

[09:53] <nine> No coredumps either?

[09:53] <MasterDuke> hm, i can check

[09:54] <MasterDuke> i always forget i have to use coredumpctl

[09:55] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e028a3c3b2c55b4dbd8d89657eca4b8e

[09:57] <MasterDuke> updated with a little more info

[09:58] <MasterDuke> and some more

[10:08] <nine> But, but, this is before my newly added code?

[10:09] <nine> Btw I didn't really test it after changing it to MVM_free_null.

[10:09] <nine> Can you change it back and test again?

[10:29] <MasterDuke> k

[10:35] <MasterDuke> oh, but CI was showing all fails on your first version too

[10:47] <MasterDuke> nine: same segfault

[10:48] <MasterDuke> backtrace looks the same

[10:52] *** Ven_de_Thiel joined
[10:59] <MasterDuke> and no surprise since CI showed it too, but same results with clang

[11:02] *** linkable6 left
[11:05] *** linkable6 joined
[11:09] <nine> Oh, now I see it, too

[11:11] <lizmat> And another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/06/29/2021-26-r3/

[11:44] <nine> MasterDuke: cought it in rr

[11:48] <nine> Well, well, in MVMStaticFrame *sf = (MVMStaticFrame *)MVM_repr_at_pos_o(tc, check_frames, i); we actually get a VMNull instead of a static frame.

[12:45] <nine> Ah, it's simply a good old GC issue

[12:50] <nine> MasterDuke: pushed a fixed version :)

[13:03] <MasterDuke> nice, and CI seems happy with it so far

[13:04] * nine slowly exhales

[13:56] <MasterDuke> nine: that missing MVMROOT was a pre-existing problem wasn't it? i.e., the first version of your PR just made it more likely to trigger somehow

[13:58] <nine> MasterDuke: no, because before my change there was no point at which we could have entered the GC. There is now with MVM_gc_mark_thread_blocked(tc);

[13:58] <MasterDuke> ah
