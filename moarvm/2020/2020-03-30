[18:19] <dogbert17> o/

[18:20] <dogbert17> todays c-lang question. Is there anything to gain, speedwise, by removing this unnecessary if-statement? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/interp.c#L6564

[18:20] <dogbert17> or are the optimizers so good that that they will detect this

[18:40] <nine> dogbert17: you could look at the generated assembly code

[18:47] <lizmat> And another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/03/30/2020-13-noconf-reached/

[19:36] <dogbert17> hmm, looks like the optimizer is clever but there's definitely a chance that I'm misreading the assembly

[22:08] <lizmat> dogbert17: looks to me that if should be removed for readability alone
