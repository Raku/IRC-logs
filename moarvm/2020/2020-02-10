[06:29] <nwc10> jnthn: it's pretty calm here. The fun is forecast to arrive in 4.5 hours, and it's surprising how little evidence there is of it yet

[09:52] <jnthn> It was very windy/wet here overnight. Then bizzarely I just walked to work in the sun.

[10:08] <moritz_> we quarter-hour stretches of sun here, and then it's all grey and windy and rainy again

[11:18] <nwc10> The fun started here about 10 minutes ago

[11:19] <jnthn> I'm not sure if we had our share of fun overnight, or if it was just the appetizer...

[11:25] <timotimo> we certainly had rattling and whistling

[13:00] <Guest4508> I wonder if I should report the "Corrupt multi dispatch cache" bug

[13:01] <Guest4508> at least we have a 100% reproducible case even though one might have to wait for it to trigger

[13:02] <Guest4508> here's the code in case anyone is interested:

[13:03] <Guest4508> while ./perl6-m -Ilib t/spec/S17-promise/lock-async-stress2.t; do :; done

[13:07] <sena_kun> Guest4508: is thee any reason _not_ to report it?

[13:08] <sena_kun> I mean, if there is a fatal bug with steps to reproduce related to our basic test suite, what can be reasons not to report it? :)

[13:09] <timotimo> implementorture

[13:11] <Guest4508> sena_kun: I didn't want to stress out jnthn :)

[13:11] <Guest4508> but of course I'll report it

[13:51] <nine> -win 10

[13:59] <nwc10> nine: US vs AT keyboard layout? (your fingers thought US, but the OS thought AT)

[14:09] <lizmat> Guest4508 jnthn confirmed on MacOS on HEAD in the 95th run

[14:09] <lizmat> MoarVM panic: Corrupt multi dispatch cache: cur_node != 0, re-check == 0x0

[14:13] <jnthn> 95th /o)

[14:19] <timotimo> i recommend rr record if you can reproduce it on linux

[14:19] <timotimo> repeat until it crashes, make sure to delete recordings in between runs, though

[14:19] <timotimo> and not to delete the recording after the crash :D

[14:20] <timotimo> oh, i think you can pass a directory that it'll use, with an env var maybe?

[14:35] <lizmat> jnthn: 2nd time I tried, it died at the 53rd try

[14:37] <Guest4508> lizmat: rr doesn't work on Ryzen cpu's if you happen to have one

[14:37] * lizmat is on MacOS

[14:39] <Guest4508> jnthn: if you're utterly bored, this is what I managed to dig out wrt the 'Corrupt multi dispatch' error

[14:39] <Guest4508> https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b74f1c978a7cf6df2562be3668979b26

[14:45] <jnthn> Not that bored, alas ;)

[14:45] <jnthn> I think I might well have investigated this one before to no avail

[14:45] <jnthn> And I'm quite sure today isn't one of my smarter-than-average days :)

[14:45] *** domidumont joined
[14:48] <Guest4508> :)

[14:49] <moritz> today is my "the answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind" day :-)

[14:52] <jnthn> Only trouble is spotting it among all the *other* things blowing in the wind...

[15:01] <lizmat> fwiw, upping the number of threads to 12, seems to make it crash sooner (29th attempt)

[15:16] <nine> nwc10: yes. I use application specific keyboard layouts. US for terminal (where I do all my coding and IRC) and AT for the rest (i.e. writing emails in German). Sometimes after a reboot KDE forgets the application specific setting

[15:33] *** sena_kun left
[15:43] <lizmat> fwiw: upping the number of threads to 64 makes it a lot slower, and I haven't seen it crash yet

[15:43] <lizmat> (running for ~ hour now)

[17:09] <lizmat> it's that time of the week again: another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/02/10/2020-06-ready-for-brewing/
