[20:23] <Kaiepi> how do i debug gc issues again?

[20:23] <Kaiepi> iirc there were some macros i need to change somewhere in src/gc

[20:27] <timotimo> first, make sure you're not experiencing what masterduke is fixing right now

[20:27] <timotimo> after that, yeah there's a GC_DEBUG one

[20:28] <timotimo> probably also depends on what exactly is going wrong

[20:28] <MasterDuke> MVM_GC_DEBUG

[20:29] <MasterDuke> for some reason i always forget it has MVM_ at the start. but luckily you can still find it easily

[20:36] <Kaiepi> ah, i thought there were other macros besides that that needed setting

[20:48] *** MasterDuke left
[20:54] *** Altai-man_ joined
[20:56] *** sena_kun left
[21:01] <timotimo> there are different memory-debug related things

[21:01] <timotimo> you can reduce the size of the nursery to force gc runs to happen more often

[21:10] *** zakharyas left
[21:17] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:54] <MasterDuke> any reason not to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1311 now?

[22:02] <timotimo> does IS_CONCRETE do a null check first?

[22:04] <MasterDuke> `#define IS_CONCRETE(o)   (!(((MVMObject *)o)->header.flags & MVM_CF_TYPE_OBJECT))`

[22:05] <MasterDuke> guess it should be `if (is->invocation_handler && IS_CONCRETE(is->invocation_handler))`

[22:14] <MasterDuke> timotimo: how does https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/b966b45380f7f2458dea6131feda0b31 look?

[22:18] <timotimo> i don't know how MVM_HASH_BIND_FREE works exactly

[22:18] <timotimo> so can't speak to the change in sc.c

[22:19] <MasterDuke> it just runs the block it gets passed

[22:19] <MasterDuke> like MVMROOT

[22:20] <timotimo> ugh, i wish i could click "expand" on gisted patch files

[22:21] <MasterDuke> ha

[22:22] <MasterDuke> can you make your greasemonkey script linkify the filenames?

[22:23] <timotimo> oh, hm, in theory i guess i can
