[08:57] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[09:33] <nine> Good day nwc10!

[09:51] <MasterDuke> this patch to add ops for allocation profiling may be getting away from me...

[10:40] *** sena_kun joined
[10:42] *** Altai-man_ left
[10:43] <MasterDuke> anybody mind reviewing this for me https://github.com/MasterDuke17/MoarVM/commit/9e263261f2109829947264fae4734a3266124e81 it currently *sometimes* causes `MoarVM panic: Register types do not match between value and node` or a segfault when trying to profile something

[11:53] <MasterDuke> unrelated, but it looks like we have 88 ops that have templates in src/jit/core_templates.expr, but no case in src/jit/graph.c

[12:01] <nine> MasterDuke: since the panic is caused by the JIT, does MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING make it more predictable?

[12:02] <MasterDuke> nine: it's more like profiling some things always causes it, but other things profile just fine

[12:03] <nine> Then I'd just bisect that list to find out which addition causes the panic

[16:46] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1270 was a bit tedious. would there be a way to do this based on a new annotation for the oplist? might make it easier to remember when adding new ops

[16:52] <timotimo> there may perhaps want to be something a little bit more intelligent about the whole instrumentation stuff

[16:52] <timotimo> like, sometimes an op allocates more than just one object, we don't catch that at the moment

[16:54] <timotimo> and the allocation logger also has a little heuristic to prevent double-counting and such, but it could also prevent counting of multiple objects made in the same op
