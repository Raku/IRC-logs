[07:42] <fluca1978> I'm having quite an headache trying to figure out how the single parts NQP and 6model are part of moarvm. Any clue?

[07:53] <nine> fluca1978: sorry, I don't understand your question

[07:55] <fluca1978> nine: moarvm includes 6model, that I believe is the definition of the object layout in memory, but the site also states that moarvm is NQP based, but NQP is compile-time related (if I'm right), so having rakudo that produces the bytecode, where does NQP kicks in?

[07:55] <nine> No, it's more like the other way round: rakudo is based on NQP. NQP may be based on MoarVM (but also runs on JVM and Javascript)

[07:56] <nine> 6model is implemented in all those backends

[07:57] <fluca1978> so rakudo is built on NQP, and produces something that both moar and jvm can crunch, but then 6model? I mean, jvm is not based on 6model

[07:58] <nine> No, MoarVM has its own bytecode format, as does JVM. I'm actually not sure how the Javascript backend works. I guess we're generating Javascript code for that.

[07:58] <nine> 6model is most of all a concept

[07:59] <nine> The implementation for JVM is e.g. here: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/tree/master/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/sixmodel

[08:00] <nine> While the MoarVM implementation is part of the VM itself: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tree/master/src/6model
