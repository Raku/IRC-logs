[08:58] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[09:05] <MasterDuke> nwc10: you saw my answer to your question?

[09:06] <MasterDuke> and follow up question for timotimo

[09:07] *** Altai-man joined
[09:08] <nwc10> yes, I did. thanks for digging further. I believe that %.*s is portable. (as lone as one remembers that the parameter for * needs to be an int)

[09:09] <nwc10> which matters on platforms where sizeof(int) != sizeof(long)

[09:09] <nwc10> (If I'm remembering how varargs parameter promotion works)

[09:09] <MasterDuke> i was wondering if the 255 limit was something to do with the max size for an "atomic" write perhaps?

[12:56] <nine> nwc10: thanks! MVM_str_hash_fetch_nocheck is indeed useful. With this it's as simple as watch -l ((MVMHashEntry*)MVM_str_hash_fetch_nocheck(tc, &((MVMHash*)(tc->cur_frame->work[*(MVMuint16*)(cur_op + 2)]))->body.hashtable, MVM_iterkey_s(tc, (MVMIter *)iter)))->value

[12:59] <MasterDuke> "as simple as"

[14:10] <[Coke]> heh.

[15:11] <nine> I think I got it.

[15:12] <nine> What NQP needs is this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d3d715f413

[15:16] <[Coke]> if you implement that in NQP, could it be removed from rakudo?

[15:16] <nine> no

[15:16] <[Coke]> not you specifically. :)

[15:17] <[Coke]> ok.

[15:29] <nine> Aaaaand...with that this bug is gone :)

[15:35] <[Coke]> nine++

[16:07] <vrurg> .ask jnthn would it be possible for you to have a look at my comment at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4096#issuecomment-740713808 ?

[16:07] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to jnthn
