[07:45] <MasterDuke> timotimo: see anything in the spesh log?

[08:52] <timotimo> i somehow forgot after downloading it

[08:52] <timotimo> i blame firefox hiding away downloaded things behind a button

[08:53] <timotimo> oh my

[08:53] <timotimo> at first i thought you might have typo'd push-all's cuuid

[08:54] <timotimo> but there's literally one with 1468 and one with 1568

[08:56] <MasterDuke> ha

[10:04] <timotimo> i see that it's OSR'd

[10:24] <timotimo> so, anyway, it's guarding for an SF, but then it doesn't even fastinvoke, and perhaps that's odd

[10:25] <timotimo> it doesn't know anything about either of the arguments, though

[10:26] <timotimo> could be another instance of "OSR makes registers unknowable"

[10:27] <MasterDuke> but only the push-all is getting OSR'ed, not the push?

[10:27] <MasterDuke> but i guess the push is inlined into the push-all

[10:28] <timotimo> not as i'm seeing

[10:47] *** MasterDuke left
[11:10] <timotimo> i've been wondering if we should perhaps compile a non-osr version of the same frame when spesh gets a moment of calm

[11:11] <timotimo> but in this case it looks like push-all is only hit a single time throughout the entire program's run time, so it wouldn't make a difference
