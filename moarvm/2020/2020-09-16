[10:04] <timotimo> https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745 - erlang otp jit based on ASMJIT with interesting tidbits like "We also considered using dynasm, but found the tooling that comes with asmjit to be better." and that it only eliminates dispatch overhead and specializing on argument types, and doing it at load-time

[10:04] <timotimo> i assume erlang "beam instructions" are sufficiently statically optimizable in this way

[14:09] <timotimo> assumedly you ran into some code that hits this often enough to matter for performance? :)

[14:11] <timotimo> always love seeing a factor or before/after numbers :)

[14:20] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/dd3eb829782403543b22b6e594cc3371 has some maybe-relevant timings

[14:34] <nwc10> the hash structure "this week".

[14:34] <nwc10> there's a plan for post release.

[14:35] <nwc10> to merge the allocations.

[14:36] <timotimo> ah, so the "metadata and other stuff" and key, value, etc go in one big block?

[14:37] *** MasterDuke left
[14:37] <nwc10> yes.

[14:37] <nwc10> I have the test code working. Now I just need to port it over.

[14:38] <jnthn> Another halving of the number of allocations. :)

[14:38] <nwc10> The bit I'm wondering about (and this can happen later) is whether to use the FSA. Beacuse for the initial hash sizes the total size needed fits inside the FSA

[14:39] <nwc10> And I don't know how frequently we create "small" hashes

[14:39] <nwc10> versus hashes that grow beyond 32 entries.

[14:39] <nwc10> in Perl 5 land, there are often lots of small hashes, because hashes are also objects. (And symbol tables, but they usually have many entries)

[14:39] <jnthn> My guess would be that a lot of hashes are small

[14:39] <jnthn> But...yes, that

[14:40] <nwc10> I guess I can test it and see what the max RSS is with the FSA and without. Or just wonder about the complexity.

[14:40] <timotimo> i could always dump stats for yall

[14:40] <nwc10> anyway, it's not yet (re)written

[14:40] <nwc10> if that's easy (in advance) that would be cool. but actually, no rush. It can be done "later".

[14:41] <nwc10> currently I am considering beer.

[14:41] <timotimo> just need to know where to do that :)

[14:41] <timotimo> like, end of stage parse perhaps?

[14:42] <nwc10> yes, I guess so

[14:43] <timotimo> let me get all newest commits maybe

[14:43] *** MasterDuke joined
[14:43] <timotimo> ah, just the comment changed

[14:49] <jnthn> Core setting compilation is probably quite a skrewed benchmark though, in that due to it doing a load of parsing, that will produce a lot more match objects and thus small hashes than the average program probably does

[14:49] <jnthn> *skewed

[14:49] <timotimo> true

[14:49] <timotimo> qast nodes also have hashes on them in many cases

[14:53] <jnthn> many many many many :)

[14:54] <jnthn> The RakuAST-based compiler basically doesn't use annotations on QAST nodes, so we'll save those at least :)

[14:57] <timotimo> very good

[14:58] <jnthn> Alas, it only passes a little over 200 spectest files (in full, others partially), so there's a bit of work to go on it yet...

[14:58] <timotimo> quite

[14:59] <timotimo> got any plan in particular to handle nqp:: ops in compile-time code? can't really just literally call an nqp op from nqp code without compilation

[15:00] <jnthn> Will probably just punt those to the compiler.

[15:00] <timotimo> there could of course be a class that has methods for a bunch of the nqp ops and we just call methods on that

[15:00] <jnthn> It's not like we want to encourage writing nqp::ops anyway

[15:01] <timotimo> the stuff in the core setting, tho :)

[15:01] <jnthn> Yes, but how much at BEGIN time? :)

[15:01] <timotimo> the specific instance that makes me ask is one of the first trait mods that uses an nqp op

[15:02] <timotimo> but i didn't verify how often that is actually called, though

[15:03] <timotimo> trait_mod:<is>($child, $parent) uses nqp::can

[15:03] <timotimo> is DEPRECATED, is required, and is default do

[15:04] <timotimo> is tighter, is looser, is equiv, is preq, is export

[15:06] <timotimo> but we did all that for performance optimization, who knows if we'll revert a lot of the "uglification" when RakuAST gets good at generating optimal code from idiomatic raku code

[15:48] <timotimo> that took way too long LOL

[15:49] <timotimo> this is how many items in use, space, how many items big the storage is

[15:49] <timotimo> well, cur_items and max_items

[15:49] <timotimo> didn't look if max_items is including or excluding the extra at the end, but probably not, since there's 11/12 in there?

[15:56] <timotimo> that is one hella big hash, tho

[16:00] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/44d925390cbd143b30f0b8a02ebfc54e (same url as before) has the fsck output for the very big hash

[16:14] <timotimo> ah, the values are MAST::Frame objects, or at least one is

[16:17] <timotimo> nwc10: do you think it'd be a bad idea to offer an fsck flag that casts entries to MVMHashEntry and outputs the debug_name of the st the value has?

[16:18] <timotimo> not all str_hash_table store MVMHashEntry, of course

[20:01] <timotimo> yeah that's good

[20:01] <timotimo> no indentation?

[20:07] <timotimo> i'm thinking, with the newline-ified output, why not give a little copy-paste-able code snippet to get at individual objects and do something with them ... or something like that

[20:08] <timotimo> nine: how would you feel about a dumper that dumps a lot more than just p6opaque?

[20:08] <timotimo> the p6opaque dumper can of course already dump strings and ints, but only if they are attributes of a class

[20:10] <timotimo> perhaps at least the right cast + address for individual things

[20:10] <timotimo> so you can with one copy-paste get at some object's Body and print it

[20:49] <timotimo> kind of makes me want an ansi escape code that tells the terminal "when this text is clicked, copy-paste the highlighted text and press enter" or something :D

[20:50] <timotimo> kind of like the clickable URL thingies that recently made the rounds

[20:51] <[Coke]> oh, that's not dangerous. :P

[20:51] <timotimo> never!

[21:29] <nine> Oh, I'd love a general MVMObject dumper

[23:32] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/ff8e61022d0c1ea028a7f3b3d39ca4c0 - nine, do you think the "already seen" impl looks sane?

[23:35] <timotimo> i've merged your seen vector and my indentation
