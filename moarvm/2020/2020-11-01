[08:44] <nine> nwc10: FWIW we already use pragmas to disable some warnings in dependencies' header files.

[08:45] <nwc10> that's a pragma within the source of the header file that would otherwise warn?

[08:47] <nine> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/jit/x64/emit.dasc#L4

[08:48] <nwc10> yes, the fun thing is "our" warnings flags on header files we don't "control". I don't think that pragamata help us there

[08:50] <nine> But that's exactly where this pragma helps? We compile everything with -Wimplicit-fallthrough but not that dynasm header file, because it's not our's

[08:51] <nwc10> oh, ah, right I see. yes. I'm confused here.

[08:59] <nwc10> actually, that approach still wouldn't work for the error I hit, as it was one of the bundled projects in 3rdparty, so we don't control any of its source code, including the #include lines

[08:59] <nwc10> need to go afk.

[08:59] <nwc10> there's a longer story about why I don't think that this is generally a "winning move"

[08:59] <nine> oh, yeah, that case sucks
