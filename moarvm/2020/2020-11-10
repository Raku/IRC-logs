[07:59] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[08:00] <nwc10> nine: that Monday thing seems to have cured itself.

[08:02] <nine> It's a miracle!

[08:02] <nine> Let's hope, it doesn't come back

[08:06] <timotimo> i have a bad feeling about this

[08:09] *** Altai-man joined
[08:10] <nine> A little more optimism, please

[08:13] <nwc10> We should look forward to Friday. :-)

[16:20] <MasterDuke> fyi, i emailed the gmp mailing list yesterday asking about the linking problem the switch-to-gmp branch has. i haven't heard back yet, but i also mentioned this channel. so if someone shows up talking about gmp, that's probably why

[17:07] <nine> As a possible solution for both the int cache and parametrics caches I figured that when precompiling, I could assemble a list of explicitly requested serialization contexts (i.e. modules) and only accept those as dependencies.

[17:08] <nine> That way it wouldn't matter if modules loaded by e.g. zef create parametrics that get fetched from the cache during precompilation (which currently would add a bogus dependency).

[17:09] <nine> However, as good as this may sound at first, it brings another problem: not all dependencies are loaded explicitly. We kinda assume that the setting and its dependencies will already be there.

[17:12] *** Kaiepi left
[17:15] <nine> Actually, the same is true for modules - they're cached by the repository implementation

[17:53] <nine> Upper layers seem to have a better picture of what's getting loaded. But it looks surprisingly hard to find out, which SCs are actually loaded.
