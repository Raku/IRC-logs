[08:30] <tellable6> 2020-07-31T07:29:55Z #moarvm <nwc10> MasterDuke: is that warning new (and not on master)?

[08:31] <MasterDuke> nwc10: yeah, not on master

[08:33] <nwc10> OK, interesting/odd as it's inside a macro that I didn't change.

[08:34] <nwc10> I'm not sure what flags I need to enable to see those. Do we get the same warnign about aliasing violations in other parts of the code? Or is that a first?

[08:34] <nwc10> $ork thing is being silly/slow today. But it's SEP from today because I'm on holiday.

[08:34] <MasterDuke> you don't have -Wstrict-aliasing set?

[08:35] <nwc10> (actually going away for 2 nights in the middle of the 2 weeks in the garden)

[08:35] <nwc10> I guess that I don't

[08:35] <MasterDuke> i don't remember seeing one of those before

[08:35] <nwc10> (I do on other $ork code)

[08:35] <MasterDuke> well, i know i sometimes see different things when building on my desktop vs laptop

[08:36] <nwc10> I shall try to figure this out after $ork

[08:36] <MasterDuke> different gcc versions, etc

[08:36] <nwc10> well, more, after I am not actively having to figure out $ork

[08:36] <MasterDuke> even though i'm using the exact same configuration/commands to build moarvm

[08:37] <nwc10> at some point today (preferably yesterday) I should migrate to the my regular "about to be AFK for a while" plan - fixing documentation

[08:38] <MasterDuke> always a thrill ride

[08:41] <MasterDuke> nwc10: but i can repro what dogbert17 said earlier, rakudo build times were a little faster on your branch

[08:41] <nwc10> good.

[08:42] <nwc10> I estimated it at about 4%. (No-one else seems brave enough to put a number on it. I was hoping I could go second on numbers)

[08:42] <nwc10> which you can take as "our hashes were serously L.T.A>"

[08:45] <nwc10> lizmat: but don't quote me on that ^^^ instead, I'd suggest something closer to "so much awesomeness has been showered down upon MoarVM that every other bottleneck has been fixed - hence hashes only became "slow" because all their competition had been eliminated"

[08:45] <MasterDuke> stage parse master is 39.342, XXX-better-hash is 36.251

[08:46] <lizmat> nwc10: I guess a lot of work was put into making sure they were safe from algorithmic complexity attacks ?

[08:47] <nwc10> I'd like someone to review that, but

[08:47] <nwc10> a) I believe it's as safe as our previous implementation

[08:47] <MasterDuke> no obvious difference in spectest time

[08:47] <nwc10> b) these things are overblown. (and I believe that I *am* quailified to say that)

[08:47] <lizmat> I know it scared the heck out of people at former $work

[08:48] <lizmat> as they got routinely attacked by a *lot* of people

[08:48] <nwc10> that was possibly the second round of fun

[08:48] <MasterDuke> nwc10: i'm not qualified to really review your branch, but i did notice a bunch of malloc/free instead of MVM_malloc/MVM_free. is that intentional?

[08:48] <nwc10> MasterDuke: no. that's not intentional. That's a good spot. Thanks

[08:49] <nwc10> there will be a rebase at some poitn. Maybe as YYY-

[08:49] <nwc10> and then ZZZ-

[08:49] <nwc10> and then I usualyl run out of ideas (at least, based on $ork test commit names)

[08:49] <lizmat> he... some of our earliest servers were called that  :-)

[08:50] <nwc10> lizmat: IIRC Python 2.7 did *not* enable protection from randomisation *by default*, and I don't remember ever reading about anyone running django getting burned (etc) because of this

[08:50] <nwc10> the other one was, having (I think) chatted with someone at said $ork

[08:50] <nwc10> the two "obvious" general ways to attack an online system are

[08:50] <nwc10> 1) figure out expensive search queries for the read-only system

[08:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1332: Fix some new compiler warnings

[08:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1332

[08:51] <nwc10> 2) once you are in the transacting system (ie the "checkout" of a web store, or similar - anything that needs to write to the DB), do your DOS there

[08:51] <nwc10> as most sites are largely read only, and that part can be easily scaled

[08:51] <nwc10> but the read/write or write parts can't

[08:51] <nwc10> I'm not *denying* that the complexity attacks could worjk

[08:52] <nwc10> and I think I figured out how to attack Perl 5 (pre 5.16) in quite an interesting way that can't be mitigated

[08:52] <nwc10> oh yes,

[08:52] <nwc10> also what was found (the second time) was that the mitigations put in place for 5.8.2 could *themselves* be attacked

[08:52] <nwc10> and actually it was scarily more effective to attack the mitigations than the original problem.

[08:52] <lizmat> otoh, one time at $ork, we ddossed ourselves

[08:53] <nwc10> "just the once?" :-)

[08:53] <lizmat> by having javascript errors sent back

[08:53] <lizmat> and making an error with that, so that in some cases the client would just send back the same error continuously

[08:54] <lizmat> take that times the number of clients and whee!

[08:54] <lizmat> that was one of the few distributed ones  :-)

[08:55] <nwc10> aspects of current $ork that I like -

[08:55] <nwc10> 1) we are not globally visible, so not a massive target

[08:55] <nwc10> 2) we don;t deal with credit cards (or anything transacting money in real time)

[08:55] <nwc10> and (at least I thought)

[08:56] <nwc10> 3) it's on site, but easily commutable

[12:30] * lizmat wonders what brrt is up to these days

[12:33] <brrt> not enough sleep, for one thing :-D

[12:33] <lizmat> well, wake up later, go to sleep earlier ? :-)

[12:37] <brrt> :-)

[12:37] <brrt> $work, is mostly what I'm doing

[12:44] <nwc10> good *, brrt 

[12:46] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[12:47] <nwc10> brrt: I made a branch. (technically, I had already made a different branch). But this branch is better.

[12:52] <brrt> where does the branch go to

[12:53] <nwc10> it got to MoarVM/XXX-A-Better-Hash

[12:53] <brrt> hah

[12:53] <nwc10> and it has all the UT hash implemetation replaced with Robin Hood hashing

[12:54] <nwc10> well, it's XXX because it has some XXX "FIXME" type comments

[12:54] <nwc10> and I didn't want anyone to merge it yet

[12:54] <nwc10> it is Safe For Work

[12:54] <nwc10> unless, well,

[12:54] <brrt> RH hashing was when you had a flat hash table and you'd swap entries to 'average' the search length, correct?

[12:54] <MasterDuke> you can do a draft PR and then it won't be merged, but you get to look at it in with the github ui a little easier

[12:54] <nwc10> IIRC in some lightning advert at a not-called-YAPC::Europe I said something like

[12:54] <nwc10> "if you like the idea of Perl 6 going faster, dontate to the P6CMF"

[12:55] <nwc10> "and if you don't" [pause]

[12:55] <nwc10> "donate to the P5CMF"

[12:55] <brrt> lol

[12:55] <brrt> I find the GH UI to be not all that optimal

[12:55] <brrt> slow, for one

[12:55] <nwc10> I have 3 or 4 more commits to push

[12:55] <nwc10> then I'll make a PR

[12:55] <nwc10> er, "then" might be tomorrow morning

[12:55] <nwc10> I'm at $ork

[12:55] <nwc10> and we have visitors soon after

[12:55] <nwc10> and there will be barbeque and beer

[12:57] <brrt> hmm, no barbeque here today, nor beer

[12:57] <brrt> lizmat: hows' the heat wave treating you?

[12:57] <nwc10> *how* far are you from Belgium? And is that distance your excuse?

[12:57] <MasterDuke> no bbq, yes beer

[12:58] <nwc10> and, hurrah, I read in the local free newspaper that the beer offer is on again at the supermarket nearby

[12:58] <nwc10> so I must visit

[12:58] <lizmat> Belgium: about 4km as the crow flies, 8km to the nearest bridge

[12:58] <nwc10> but tomorrow. or Monday. In the morning. When sober

[12:58] <nwc10> (sadly the branch within walking distance no longer plays along with the beer offer)

[12:59] <brrt> I am in fact very close to Belgium

[12:59] <nwc10> and Luxemburg? "Too close for comfort"?

[12:59] <brrt> But the province I'm closest too (Antwerpen) is CLOSED FOR CORONA

[12:59] <nwc10> although I buy their explanation that they are full of (fithly) foreiners

[12:59] <nwc10> visiting daily. to do work.

[12:59] <brrt> so I could go but I'd have to spend 14 days in quarantine

[12:59] <nwc10> that's a bugger. doesn't sound like a good idea

[13:00] <brrt> it sucks.

[13:00] <nwc10> hence why no beer? :-(

[13:00] <brrt> no, the becasue of the no-beer is the fact that I'm the designated driver :-)

[13:00] <MasterDuke> doesn't belgium have the highest deaths/million of population ratio?

[13:01] <brrt> idk

[13:03] <nwc10> brrt: I'm glad that your group is sensible, but saddened to learn that no-one else takes their turn at it.

[13:07] <brrt> Well, the fact that I'm the only one in the group that has a drivers license kind of forces the issue :-)

[13:07] <nwc10> they should learn!

[13:07] <brrt> absoluteluy

[13:07] <brrt> absolutely

[13:08] <nwc10> or they should set up a pub locally.

[13:08] <nwc10> (not recommended. I understand it to be very hard work)

[13:11] <brrt> indeed

[13:12] <brrt> I'm trying to find... where are my notes for the linear 'expression' JIT

[13:12] <nwc10> "behind the sofa?" is a usual faceitous answer. But are these disk files, or real bits of paper?

[13:13] *** sena_kun joined
[13:14] *** Altai-man_ left
[13:16] <brrt> disk files

[13:17] <brrt> if they were bits of paper then I knew where they were

[13:17] <brrt> I still know the plan vaguely but I had it worked out to a considerable level of detail

[13:17] <nwc10> I thought that ripgrep was the newer shiny, replacing ag, replacing ack

[13:18] <nwc10> so just leave a brute-force search of the disk running while you do your solem duty as designated driver?

[13:18] <lizmat> brrt: to answer your question: 33.2 outside, 25.2 inside

[13:18] <lizmat> outside == in the shade

[13:19] <nwc10> lizmat: that sounds very close to the numbers here

[13:19] <lizmat> expectation was 36 here, but I don't think we're going to reach that

[13:19] <nwc10> #11955 When in doubt, use brute force.

[13:20] *** domidumont left
[13:20] <brrt> ripgrep is fairly shiny

[13:21] <brrt> I sometime doesn't quite do what I want it to, but usually it finds stuff

[13:21] <brrt> I had codesearch installed before, which has an index, and is faster overall

[13:43] <nwc10> that seemed to end up being a rebase, and then with new commits

[13:43] <nwc10> I'm not sure what I rebased

[13:45] <nwc10> aha:

[13:45] <nwc10> -+                         * (Doesn't allocate, so can't deadlock. */

[13:45] <nwc10> ++                         * (Doesn't allocate, so can't deadlock.) */

[13:46] <nwc10> might be fractionally faster, because it now pre-sizes the hashes for bytecode deserialisation and hash copying

[13:46] <nwc10> but I don't know if that will make any measurable difference

[14:36] <dogbert17> nwc10: I did a git pull on my XXX-A-Better-Hash and I can't build. There's a merge conflict in src/core/str_hash_table.c

[14:39] <[Coke]> dogbert17: I think that's just your copy

[14:39] <[Coke]> I just did a git pull --rebase, don't see any merge conflict markers.
