[17:35] <timotimo> i wouldn't say no to a merge, then

[17:36] <timotimo> sorry for the late response

[17:36] <MasterDuke> cool, np

[17:37] <MasterDuke> btw, i never figured out what you mean by the comment in the commit that changed the fprintf to snprintf+fputs https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/80e5fe5ad9cbb643d1579515e8e66aa462c691ee

[19:05] <timotimo> i was pretty sure that using the same file or perhaps io handle for multiple moar processes was garbling output

[20:40] <MasterDuke> oh interesting! my make_MVMSpeshCandidate_an_MVMCollectable branch sadly, but not surprisingly, still panics right at the start of stage parse of a rakudo build

[20:40] <MasterDuke> however...it succeeds when run with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[21:35] <jnthn> MasterDuke: We'd never create any MVMSpeshCandidate objects if spesh is disabled, alas, so it's not quite so good a hint

[21:35] <jnthn> Could be worth checking some of the other options though (like does inlining being disabled have any impact)

[22:35] *** zakharyas left
[23:09] <MasterDuke> doh. ha!

[23:11] <MasterDuke> nope, still get the panic with just INLINE|PEA|OSR disabled
