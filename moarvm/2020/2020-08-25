[09:02] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[09:02] <nwc10> (I forgot)

[09:16] <jnthn> releasable6: status

[09:17] <releasable6> jnthn, Next release in ≈25 days and ≈9 hours. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[09:17] <releasable6> jnthn, Details: https://gist.github.com/8b30ad8b34323fc9203dbb46d0c95692

[09:17] <jnthn> I think that means we can merge the hash stuff rather soon :)

[09:17] <nwc10> ah yes

[09:17] <nwc10> I realised that I was a bit fried yesterady, so didn't try to prepare for this

[09:17] <nwc10> my plan was

[09:17] <nwc10> make a branch A-Better-Hash

[09:17] <nwc10> fix that XXX commit message

[09:17] <nwc10> and, maybe

[09:18] <nwc10> re-order the code review commits immediately after their relevant first commit(s), and verify that `git diff` between the two branches is 0

[09:18] <nwc10> I'm notionally doing $work currently

[09:19] <nwc10> but I shouldn't summarise that on a logged channel.

[09:39] <MasterDuke> nwc10: would you squash/rebase the code review commits into their relevant first commits or leave them separate?

[09:40] <nwc10> if I put them next to them, I think I'd prefer to leave them separate

[09:41] <nwc10> I see some merit in leaving the history of "ideas we explored but didn't quite get right first time"

[09:41] <nwc10> but "next to them" also then means that it's not too hard to see what we ended up with

[09:42] <nwc10> anyway, I have a work ticekt to work on

[09:42] <nwc10> which obviously means that I can now charge tea drinking to another department :-)

[10:18] <nwc10> jnthn: rakuast doesn't generate any ASAN excitement (did not run spec tests)

[10:19] <nwc10> but IIRC new-disp did at some point about the time you went on holiday. but as the spectests have (I think) moved on and it has not, I didn't run them

[10:19] <nwc10> and I can't currently spot what I thought was upsetting it

[14:48] <jnthn> dogbert11: Hmm, CI sees a Windows test failure

[14:56] <MasterDuke> NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make 'gen/nqp-version'

[15:58] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: is that all it says?

[16:01] <dogbert11> this change is slightly suspect: * build,win: link to user32.lib and advapi32.lib (George Zhao)

[18:58] <timotimo> perhaps make a pullrequest with only that commit reverted?

[19:08] <Altai-man> timotimo, why?

[19:09] <Altai-man> After re-run CI passed.

[19:09] <timotimo> damn

[19:11] <[Coke]> Altai-man: adapated your PR comments after it got merged to master; thanks.

[19:11] <[Coke]> ... wrong window.

[19:14] <Altai-man> [Coke], you are welcome! Thanks for your improvements in the first place. :)

[20:24] <dogbert11> yay, Altai-man, did you rerun the the CI test?

[20:27] <dogbert11> jnthn: the test failure disappeared after the failing test was rerun

[20:34] <Altai-man> dogbert11, yeah.

[21:00] <jnthn> dogbert11: ah, ok, nice

[21:00] <jnthn> Maybe unlucky timing with respect to some other nqp/rakudo change
