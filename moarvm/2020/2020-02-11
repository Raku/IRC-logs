[17:20] <patrickb> I'm currently looking at the dyncall 3rdparty submodule. Version 1.1 got released recently and I'd like to update.

[17:21] <patrickb> When looking at the git history it seems as older updates actually imported the mercurial commits while the two more recent bumps just copied all the files in.

[17:21] <patrickb> Does that mean, that there are actually no changes between the official mercurial dyncall repo and the github.com/MoarVM/dyncall git repo?

[17:21] <patrickb> Is updating as easy as replacing the entire working directory of the dyncall git repo with the respective mercurial commit and commiting the result (and loosing any potential changes there might possibly have been in our repo)?

[17:24] <jnthn> Hopefully any of the changes we did make are long enough ago to have been fixed upstream. The commit log for the repo suggests there are very very few such changes though

[17:24] <jnthn> And others may well have just done exactly what you're suggesting since then

[17:24] <jnthn> I'd try that as a first resort, anyway

[17:25] <patrickb> So the plan is to just hope for the best and overwrite with vanilla upstream. OK. Will do!

[19:05] <lizmat> patrickb nine ^^

[19:05] <lizmat> should I bump Moar / NQP ?

[19:06] <patrickb> lizmat: Thanks!

[19:07] <patrickb> lizmat: A bump would be fine. Then I can also merge the corresponding PRs in NQP and rakudo. :-D

[19:07] <lizmat> ok, will do the bump in Moar then, leaving the NQP and Rakudo ones to you ?

[20:42] <patrickb> Dyncall bump PR is done: https://github.com/MoarVM/dyncall/pull/7

[20:42] <patrickb> ^ Merge at latest convenience.

[20:42] <patrickb> The actual bump in MoarVM will happen separately.

[20:44] <lizmat> patrickb I would like to merge asap, to give more testing before release

[20:44] <lizmat> so, should I merge that now ?

[20:44] <lizmat> jnthn ?

[21:59] <dogbert11> t/spec/S07-hyperrace/basics.t fails one of its tests

[22:06] <lizmat> dogbert11: yeah, reported this a few hours ago on #raku-dev, no takers :-(

[22:07] <MasterDuke> looks like it might be that s/// change jnthn made recently

[22:09] * lizmat builds without that commit

[22:11] <lizmat> yup, that's the one

[22:12] <lizmat> I wonder if the test is faulty

[22:14] <MasterDuke> looks like a memory corruption or something like that

[22:15] <lizmat> well, then we finally have a reproducible case for that  :-)

[22:15] <lizmat> MasterDuke: will you do the honors of an issue, or should I?

[22:17] <MasterDuke> i can
