[10:05] <dumarchie> MasterDuke, can you have a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1237#issuecomment-744273918 ?

[10:08] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure what's the race there?

[10:09] <MasterDuke> but i suspect you'll really need nine, jnthn, timotimo, or nwc10 to take a look

[10:09] <dumarchie> Two threads see the cache is not properly initialized. Both assign a new object. Then later one of them finds out the object is different than expected.

[10:11] <MasterDuke> hm

[10:15] <dumarchie> I'm not a C programmer, but maybe even the pointer itself could become corrupted?

[10:17] <MasterDuke> there is a mutex that's used for some multicache operations. e.g., https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/82a34e25a8f66847a1d895214488264618f4dd82/src/6model/reprs/MVMMultiCache.c#L209

[10:18] <MasterDuke> you could try wrapping that init in a lock/unlock

[10:22] <dumarchie> I guess it's safe to use the mutex_multi_cache_add for initialization as well. I'll give it a try. It's probably more interesting than writing a hello_world.c :)

[10:23] <dumarchie> Otoh, do we want a lock/unlock for every MVM_multi_cache_add ?

[10:23] <jnthn> iirc, the idea was that threads may race to install the multi cache, and whoever loses just ends up with that being GC'd later

[10:23] <tellable6> hey jnthn, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/9b64d0622fc34b57dbfae790e6562af7

[10:26] <dumarchie> jnthn, that makes sense to me. But does the cur_node check in line 258 make sense from that perspective?

[10:34] <MasterDuke> dumarchie: do you still have the problem with a current rakudo? according to one of your recent comments, you still have a rakudo from 2020.10, even though your moarvm is from 2020.11

[10:36] <dumarchie> All my recent debugging was with Rakudo v2020.10-275-gc63f078a2

[10:36] <MasterDuke> there were some changes to cas between now and then, but i think they were just optimizations and shouldn't have changed how it works

[10:39] <dumarchie> I don't see them in https://github.com/dumarchie/rakudo/compare/master...rakudo:master

[10:40] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1ccfb095d19e47fff8a864836312b603dac6f8e3

[10:41] <MasterDuke> oh ha. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/96ab6eba55243670f5cf4b9be3ae0bba491a4663 was by you

[10:42] <dumarchie> :)  I checked and they are part of the Rakudo I built

[10:43] <MasterDuke> but it says v2020.10-275-gc63f078a2 ? something's off then

[10:47] <MasterDuke> did you pull tags?

[10:48] <dumarchie> iirc I just did a `git pull upstream master`

[10:49] <dumarchie> That should pull tags, right?

[10:49] <MasterDuke> nope. need to do a round of pull/push with `--tags`

[10:50] <dumarchie> Oh... maybe a `--rebase` does it as well? That's what I normally use.

[10:50] <MasterDuke> but this does make it interesting that i can't repro. i thought you had an old rakudo, but if not than i wonder why i don't get the panic

[10:51] <MasterDuke> what's your OS and hardware?

[10:52] <dumarchie> Windows 10. Let me figure out how to get CPU info.

[10:53] <dumarchie> Intel Core i5-6200U

[10:54] <dumarchie> I guess most devs have an AMD?

[10:56] <MasterDuke> well, i know nine and i do

[10:56] <dumarchie> A colleague of mine also failed to repro on Linux on AMD.

[10:56] <MasterDuke> yeah, i'm on linux also

[10:58] <dumarchie> But note that I can't consistently repro. Only once in a while I have the "Switching to Thread" followed by a panic.

[10:59] <MasterDuke> what compiler are you using?

[10:59] <MasterDuke> i usually build with gcc, but i'll try switching to clang

[11:00] <dumarchie> For my latest build I used gcc provided by MinGW

[11:02] *** tib left
[11:06] <MasterDuke> been running in a loop for a couple minutes, still no panic

[11:12] <dumarchie> Maybe you can speed it up with `benchmark/stack.raku 100` to limit the number of values pushed and popped per run.

[11:23] <MasterDuke> couple minutes of that each with gcc and clang, no panic

[11:24] <dumarchie> You also didn't see the "Switching to Thread"?

[11:28] <MasterDuke> nope

[11:50] <dumarchie> Can you limit the number of CPU cores MoarVM uses?

[11:55] <MasterDuke> i think so

[12:02] <dumarchie> Maybe it helps if you limit them to 4 or 2.

[12:02] *** linkable6 left
[12:02] *** evalable6 left
[12:02] <MasterDuke> been running various configurations with 2 cores, no dice so far

[12:04] <MasterDuke> how long does it usually take for you to get an error?

[12:05] *** evalable6 joined
[12:10] <dumarchie> It varies between 1 and about 20 runs.

[12:11] <MasterDuke> i've probably done over 1k across the different configurations. seems like it might be a windows thing

[14:02] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to dumarchie

[14:06] *** lucasb joined
[14:08] <nine> Naively putting that allocation insided the locked area can cause a deadlock: allocation may trigger garbage collection. If another thread is waiting for that mutex, it won't be able to enter the GC, so GCing threads are waiting for that thread to join and that thread is waiting for the multi cache mutex to become available

[14:58] <dumarchie> Maybe it would be better to obtain and manipulate a private pointer to the `cache` (i.e. the `cache_obj->body`) instead of manipulating and checking the `cache_obj` itself?

[15:00] <MasterDuke> dumarchie: is valgrind available for windows?

[15:02] <nine> dumarchie: I don't see what that would change

[15:03] <nine> also that's exactly what happens in line 165

[15:09] <nine> dumarchie: did you notice that the message says cur_node != 0, re-check == 0000000000000000? In my book, 0000000000000000 is decidedly 0. Previous messages in the same GH issue said <nil> which should be quite 0, too

[15:09] <nine> dumarchie: what does gdb say that cur_node actually is?

[15:11] <dumarchie> How do I ask gdb?

[15:12] <nine> p cur_node

[15:12] <dumarchie> Let met try to trigger another panic.

[15:12] <nine> in that call frame. From MVM_panic you'll have to do up

[15:13] <dumarchie> You mean `(gdb) up` and then `(gdb) p cur_node` ?

[15:13] <nine> yes

[15:18] <MasterDuke> might need to recompile with `--optimize=0`

[15:20] <dumarchie> Just MoarVM, I suppose. How do I do that efficiently?

[15:21] <nine> Just run MoarVM's Configure.pl manually and do a make install. No need to touch nqp or rakudo

[15:44] <MasterDuke> that should be the same as `up`, so yeah

[15:45] <MasterDuke> you did `make install` after the configure?

[15:47] <dumarchie> Yes, both in `nqp\MoarVM` and in the main `rakudo` directory. But I see that *install\bin\moar.dll* was not changed...

[15:47] <nine> dumarchie: did you still have the debugger running when doing make install?

[15:48] <nine> That could prevent make install from replacing the file

[15:48] <dumarchie> No, I'm using just one command prompt.

[15:53] <nine> dumarchie: can you please try this patch?

[15:56] <dumarchie> It looks like the first `gmake install` from *nqp\MoarVM>* installed in *nqp\MoarVM\install\bin\* and the second `gmake install` thought that was OK...

[15:56] <nine> dumarchie: oh, you have to specify the --prefix to Configure.pl

[15:57] <nine> Same prefix as for rakudo

[15:57] <dumarchie> The other files in the main *install\bin\* _were_ updated ...

[15:57] <nine> by the make install in rakudo

[15:59] <dumarchie> I guess so. To apply your patch I can just do a `git pull` in *nqp\MoarVM\* ?

[15:59] <nine> and `git checkout try_fix_multi_cache_add`

[16:00] <nine> then make install. After you ran Configure.pl again with a correct --prefix

[16:02] <dumarchie> That would be `--prefix="c:\raku\rakudo\install\" in my case, I guess.

[16:02] <nine> looks good

[16:05] <dumarchie> Do you prefer the first or the last compile error?

[16:06] <dumarchie> First: src\gen\config.c:238: error: unterminated argument list invoking macro "MVMROOT"

[16:06] <nine> There shouldn't be any :D

[16:06] <nine> what the? I was nowhere near that code

[16:07] <dumarchie>      MVMROOT(tc, config, {

[16:08] <dumarchie>             ^

[16:08] <nine> There's something seriously wrong.

[16:08] <nine> Can you please try a `git clean -xfd` followed by `perl Configure.-l --prefix="c:\raku\rakudo\install"` and `make install`?

[16:09] <dumarchie> OK

[16:10] <nine> If that alone doesn't help, then maybe deleting the c:\raku\rakudo\install completely before that will

[16:10] <dumarchie> I did the `git clean -xfd` and `perl Configure.pl --optimize=0 --debug=3 --prefix="c:\raku\rakudo\install\".

[16:11] <nine> No need for --optimize=0 --debug=3

[16:11] <dumarchie> Just to be sure: does it matter where I do the `gmake install`?

[16:11] <nine> in the MoarVM directory

[16:14] <dumarchie> Same error. I will delete both c:\raku\rakudo\install and c:\raku\rakudo\nqp\MoarVM\install and try again.

[16:17] <dumarchie> B.t.w. `git status` tells me "modified:   3rdparty/libuv (untracked content)". Does that matter?

[16:20] <dumarchie> config.o is now compiled fine, so I guess not

[16:21] <nine> step by step :)

[16:25] <dumarchie> Okay, compiled the moar binaries. I guess I now have to do another `gmake install` in c:\raku\rakudo\

[16:26] <nine> no

[16:26] <nine> or yes, since you deleted install previously

[16:26] <nine> in that case you also need a make install in nqp

[16:59] <nine> Makes me wonder: what if there are actually 2 bugs here and I did fix the one?

[17:03] <dumarchie> In line 210, the `MVM_multi_cache_find` could operate on a `cache_obj` that is modified by a thread that has not reached line 209 yet, I think

[17:04] <nine> How would that be modified?

[17:04] <dumarchie> Line 162.

[17:04] <nine> cache_obj is a local variable

[17:05] <nine> line 162 allocates a new object that other threads do not have any reference to

[17:06] <dumarchie> I'm not going to argue with you :)  

[17:06] <dumarchie> I don't know C. I just saw the parameter declared as `MVMObject *cache_obj`

[17:08] *** Altai-man joined
[17:08] <dumarchie> I guess that dereferences the pointer?

[17:10] *** sena_kun left
[17:11] <nine> that declares a pointer. cache_obj is just a pointer. dereferencing is via ->

[17:13] <nine> I only see 2 ways how a second check could find a candidate where the first one didn't: either the cache changed, or the thing we're looking for changed between the first and the second find

[17:14] <nine> The cache is protected by the mutex. Unless there's some other code that modifies the cache without taking the mutex, I don't see how the cache could change

[17:14] <MasterDuke> there is a MVM_MULTICACHE_DEBUG that enables a `dump_cache`. dump at every find?

[17:15] <dumarchie> Afk to buy food.

[17:49] *** vrurg left
[18:04] *** domidumont1 left
[18:08] <nine> Following the hypthesis that the thing we're looking for changes mid-way: we're looking for an MVMCallCapture. That's a set of arguments. The arguments to cas are: (Mu $target is rw, Mu \expected, Mu \value)

[19:46] <dumarchie> Furthermore the panic appears to be triggered by `prefix:<⚛>`, but maybe that first sees a `:U` and then a `:D` because another thread already performed a `cas`.
