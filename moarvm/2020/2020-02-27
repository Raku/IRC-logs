[16:01] <dogbert17> Is there any interest in adding TSAN support to Configure.pl ?

[16:18] <lizmat> feels like a useful addition ?

[16:25] <dogbert17> I thinks so. I have it working locally

[20:12] <MasterDuke> dogbert17: do you have the raku backtrace?

[20:15] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: I can probably dig it up

[20:16] *** hankache joined
[20:18] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: added the backtrace to the gist

[20:20] <MasterDuke> uh, that's odd. lineof does take a named 'cache' argument
