[18:31] <nwc10> oh my. I'm sitting in gdb, and I have a problem on the 49825th hash that we allocate.

[18:32] <nwc10> and this is just somewhere in QRegex.nqp

[18:32] <nwc10> (compiling it)

[18:32] <nwc10> which I assume is not the most massive thing we get to deal with.

[18:35] <MasterDuke> what is the problem?

[18:37] <nwc10> a bug in the code I'm trying to write

[18:37] <nwc10> it was more my somewhat surprise at just how many hashes we routinely allocated

[18:38] <MasterDuke> every match object has at least one iirc

[18:48] <MasterDuke> timotimo: getting  `Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$databasefile'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Str ("/home/p6/rakudo/cor...)` from the moarperf appimage

[20:59] <timotimo> MasterDuke: it wants a .sqlite3 or .sql or .mvmheap filename

[21:00] <MasterDuke> yep, that's what it was

[21:00] <timotimo> should probably make that error message clearer

[21:01] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/f18524407c959047dcd7a4a227025156 more context

[21:01] <MasterDuke> i was able to open it by running my locally checked out moarperf

[21:02] <MasterDuke> annoyingly though the allocations tab never loaded any actual data

[21:03] <MasterDuke> it is a 1.7gb sqlite3 file

[21:37] <timotimo> does it work with the appimage when you don't put an argument in the commandline and put the path in the web ui instead?

[21:37] <MasterDuke> nope, same error
