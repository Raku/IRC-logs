[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update:

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: the automated scripts have to be changed a little

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: bit more, because emoji-data.txt isn't in emoji-13/

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: any more.

[02:37] <timotimo> i think nobody started on this yet, so i went ahead and did the simplest pieces

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update:

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: Also, I haven't checked if everything is still correct,

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: especially the tangut ideograph supplement block support

[02:37] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/unicode-13-update: could possibly be wrong?

[02:38] <timotimo> samcv: you may want to look over my changes, and perhaps you also know why the downloader had to be changed for the folder names on the ftp that apparently recently changed from "5" to "5.0" and such? and why ever the emoji-data.txt went from emoji-13 to ucd.zip or something?

[02:39] <timotimo> i manually copied the emoji-data.txt file over into the emoji-13 folder to get ucd2c.pl to finish, but there's surely a more general approach here

[19:23] <samcv> timotimo, i will check it out now

[19:24] *** kawaii left
[19:30] <samcv> timotimo, oh the ftp names sometimes change... at least it has happened before. I'm going to run the ucd2c.pl and see what crops up (before your changes) just to double check things. maybe add more error checking depending

[19:35] *** sena_kun joined
[19:36] <samcv> I am going to check out Unicode spec chapter 4 as the "die" message my past self wrote:

[19:36] <samcv> processing UnicodeData.txt...<Tangut Ideograph Supplement> encountered. Make sure to check https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch04.pdf for Name Derivation Rule Prefix Strings

[19:36] <samcv> Also you will likely have to make a change to MVM_unicode_get_name() and add a test to nqp at ./tools/ucd2c.pl line 1916

[20:35] <samcv> timotimo, ok, i've made some improvements to the script. I am writing into the branch you pushed. I removed your changes to the script, and i want to make sure that the error that happens when it's run is clear enough for you to make the right choice

[20:37] <samcv> tldr, your changes were incorrect, but it's mostly because the script wasn't clear enough and not enough comments in this section. Please run it again and I am hoping I have fixed the situation (goal being to make it easier for people not me to update unicode versions)

[22:48] <moon-child> a while ago, I started working on a library to embed rakudo.  It mostly worked fine, although it wasn't very featureful.  Today, I tried running its tests, and I get a '*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated'

[22:48] <moon-child> basically the way it worked is there was a raku function that evaluated strings passed to it, constructed a native c object based on that, and returned it.  I get that error after returning the object

[22:54] <jnthn> Probably somewhere there's a buffer overflow. I suggest using either valgrind or ASAN (on a debug build) to get more information on where it happens.

[22:55] <moon-child> should I recompile my moar with debug syms then?

[22:55] <jnthn> Yes

[23:13] <moon-child> valgrind says nothing

[23:14] <timotimo> could be a security feature that's not happy about NativeÏ‡all

[23:14] <moon-child> will try rebuilding with asan

[23:15] <moon-child> timotimo: could be...I doubt it, though

[23:15] <moon-child> only thing I can think of is w^x, but I don't think I have that on

[23:16] <timotimo> stack smashing would probably be stack cookies or something

[23:17] <jnthn> I think (though hazy memory) it's something that gets compiled in

[23:17] <moon-child> one thing I was thinking was that it doesn't know the abi convention for returning a struct of that size.  But that seems like an odd thing to regress on

[23:18] <jnthn> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345670/stack-smashing-detected/50690687

[23:19] <timotimo> i don't think we have any support for returning structs ATM

[23:19] <moon-child> wait, no, nvm, it was a pointer to a struct

[23:19] <moon-child> so it couldn't be that anyway

[23:19] <jnthn> Maybe you got a compiler upgrade, or something changed such that the stack protector is turned on

[23:20] *** sena_kun left
[23:20] <moon-child> but if the stack protector is triggering, the code is probably doing something wrong anyway

[23:21] <jnthn> Indeed.

[23:21] <jnthn> Are you running MoarVM HEAD, btw?

[23:22] <moon-child> whatever is the most recent thing that nqp gen-moar pulls

[23:22] <jnthn> I sw this go by recently: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2252a95df953d7182e2a380dffdfd50e55380bab
