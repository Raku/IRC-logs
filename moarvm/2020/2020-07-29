[15:20] <timotimo> yo

[15:20] <nwc10> \o

[15:28] <timotimo> slightly surprised by the amount of times read_hash_str_var ends up with a 0 elems hash during startup

[15:33] <nwc10> People are welcome to test that.

[15:33] <nwc10> For portability

[15:33] <nwc10> and performance

[15:34] <nwc10> and anything else :-)

[15:34] <nwc10> It still has some XXX-es in places

[15:34] <nwc10> but it's probably ready for review

[15:34] <nwc10> and apart from the "portability" bit, it's got all the bits needed for production

[15:35] <nwc10> I suspect that, to get it into the next release, it needs some pre-review loving, before jnthn gets back from holiday.

[15:38] <[Coke]> nwc10: does it need anything special from nqp/rakudo?

[15:39] <nwc10> no.

[15:42] <[Coke]> how can I tell rakudo Configure.pl to build nqp? It's finding one in my path and saying "yes, this is fine"

[15:43] <nwc10> that I don't know. I'm usually building each in turn to a fixed prefix

[15:43] <[Coke]> is *this* the case when I want --force-rebuild?

[15:43] <nwc10> (And then getting confused because I have 4 sets of checkouts and 6+ prefixes)

[16:24] <timotimo> [Coke]: i cannot recommend against using --gen-blah enough :)

[16:24] <timotimo> but i think if you --gen-moar=XXX-A-Better-Hash it might do what you watn

[16:28] <[Coke]> timotimo: I realized too late it was finding existing nqp because I kept my default --prefix. working on rebuilding my installed rakudo (which i broke) and then testing nwc's branch on mac.

[16:30] <timotimo> oops :)

[16:35] <timotimo> nwc10: any reason in particular the order of register_core_repr calls has changed? it doesn't seem ordered alphabetically at least, neither before nor after

[16:43] <nwc10> it's ordered by rerp ID

[16:43] <nwc10> which avoids the need to store the repr ID in the lookup array

[16:44] <timotimo> ooh

[16:47] <[Coke]> nwc10: make test passes for rakudo on osx15.5

[16:48] <[Coke]> running a stresstest now

[17:04] <nwc10> cool, thanks. I'd tested it on debian. and debian.

[17:14] <timotimo> there's a boatload of changes there; this is now a full new implementation?

[17:22] <nwc10> yes.

[17:22] <nwc10> it's open addressing, Robin Hood hashing

[17:22] <nwc10> currently with two memory blocks allocated

[17:22] <nwc10> but that will "migrate" to one

[17:22] <nwc10> actually, the plan is a bit more batshit than that

[17:22] <nwc10> a single block

[17:22] <nwc10> [data ....][control structure][metadata]

[17:22] <[Coke]> no failures on make test or make stresstest

[17:23] <nwc10> because it can all mainatain 8 byte alignment

[17:23] <nwc10> [Coke]: \o/

[17:23] <[Coke]> let me know if you need ... timings or stuff, not just "yes, tests pass"

[17:23] <nwc10> at which point hash copy is

[17:23] <nwc10> malloc, memcpy, write barriers

[17:23] <nwc10> I'm curious about timings. But you'd need MoarVM master to compare with.

[17:24] <nwc10> but dont' stress about timings. Someone else likely will produce timings.

[17:24] *** zakharyas left
[17:24] <nwc10> the "OS X passes" is excellent news

[17:24] <nwc10> I've fixed my ssh keys on the GCC compile farm

[17:24] <nwc10> so arguably I can now go test on big endian systems

[17:25] <nwc10> the code doesn't (shouldn't) have endian related assumptions (yet)

[17:25] <[Coke]> would a windows test be helpful?

[17:25] <nwc10> (that's another optimisation)

[17:25] <[Coke]> that's more work, but still doable.

[17:25] <nwc10> yes, a Windows test would be really useful

[17:25] <nwc10> more useful than timings

[17:25] <nwc10> don't sweat it

[17:25] <nwc10> although our usual Windows tester is on holiday :-)

[17:26] <nwc10> oh, I should go up and check on food
