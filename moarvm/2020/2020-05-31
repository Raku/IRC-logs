[08:18] <patrickb> I have just registered the 'MoarVM' AzureCI organization and made the `raku-infra` user its owner.  (That same virtual user is used for the Raku and rakudo AzureCI orgs). Is this OK or should someone from MoarVM (jnthn) take ownership?

[08:46] <patrickb> I have just requested to install the AzureCI hooks to MoarVM/MoarVM. I'd be grateful for someone with permissions to approve. This will allow me to enable AzureCI testing for MoarVM.

[08:47] <nwc10> patrickb: seem useful, but I can't help. (I'm not anything official)

[08:47] <nwc10> jnthn: I think that there is a bug in commit 295cde4fcffccf45c68d75fbaec46f11aa00b0c4

[08:48] <patrickb> Morning!

[08:48] <nwc10> jnthn: I think that it's missing a check for (key_in)->body.num_graphs == key_out->body.num_graphs

[08:49] <nwc10> and both better written using MVM_string_graphs_nocheck()

[08:50] <nwc10> and I *think* we've never noticed because the preceding if (hashval == (out)->hh.hashv) {\ has always saved us. (which implies that the hash function is pretty good.

[08:50] <nwc10> Morning!

[13:36] <jnthn> nwc10: Hmm, that's interesting indeed...

[13:36] <jnthn> Also, yes, if the hash function really has covered us...wow.

[13:36] <nwc10> that's also what I thought. "That can't be buggy. It must have been found by now..."

[13:37] <jnthn> I've lost count of the number of times I've thought that :)

[13:46] <patrickb> jnthn: Did you see my above messages wrt AzureCI?

[13:46] <jnthn> patrickb: Tried to do the approval, let me know if it doesn't work out

[13:46] <jnthn> lol, nice timing :P

[13:46] <patrickb> ;-)

[13:46] <patrickb> jnthn, is the infra user ok as org owner or should I make you the owner of the MoarVM azure org?

[13:47] <jnthn> What is the infra user?

[13:47] <jnthn> e.g. is there one person who can do stuff with that, or a group of people?

[13:48] <rba> This is a user I use and it‘s in the password store, where Matthias has access too.

[13:48] <MasterDuke> patrickb: btw, it looks like the azure setup doesn't have all the same moar build option configurations as the current travis/appveyor setup

[13:48] <jnthn> OK, that sounds better than it being me.

[13:48] <jnthn> Do I have to make some kind of azure account to see CI output once this is adopted?

[13:49] <patrickb> No, it's all in public

[13:49] <jnthn> Very nice

[13:49] <patrickb> once the github hooks are in place there should be nice links from github as well

[13:49] <rba> We learnd that in azure we can put 5 users and give them the full access.

[13:50] <MasterDuke> can multiple people be granted the ability to restart jobs? that's one annoying thing about travis, sometimes i can restart them and other times not, and i have no idea why

[14:05] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Not sure. I think there are no limits on users or similar, but we'll have to try to find out.

[14:06] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Do you know the ins and outs of the travis configuration? The MoarVM one is a lot more complex than those of Rakudo and NQP.

[14:11] <patrickb> I think I

[14:11] <patrickb> I'll set up the AzureCI config the way I have it now and see about the other build options travis currently provides in a separate step.

[14:17] <MasterDuke> patrickb: no, i just looked at the options being passed in the two different systems and saw they had some obvious differences

[14:18] <patrickb> MasterDuke: I'll have a look in the coming days.

[14:19] <patrickb> jnthn: Creating the pipeline has worked.

[14:20] <MasterDuke> heh. could probably disable the JVM build configurations...
