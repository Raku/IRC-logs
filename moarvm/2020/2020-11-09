[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: cc33e53739 | Work to replace the intcache with an approach that doesn't leak "does".

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: e9847fce2e | For ops that can use `fastcreate` to generate ints or bigints, always do so.

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: 7580f2592b | The OPs sp_{add,sub,mul}_I no longer need the `MVM_intcache_type_index`.

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: f5821bf69c | Delete OPs sp_fastbox_{i,bi}_ic as they are now identical to sp_fastbox_{i,bi}

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: c2ecbabc85 | Use `MVM_repr_box_int` instead of `MVM_intcache_get` in macros in args.c

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: 01ad9c19c1 | Use `MVM_repr_box_int` in `MVM_serialization_read_ref` and bigintops.c

[12:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/intcache-does-leakage: 77fc39a891 | Move `MVM_intcache_for` into reprconv.c, retaining only what we still need.

[12:44] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: nwc10++ created pull request #1379: Eliminate the intcache; add "fastcreate" style logic to MVM_repr_box_int

[12:44] <nwc10> enjoy.

[12:47] <nwc10> I heard that you hated software, so I deleted some.

[13:43] <tellable6> 2020-11-08T15:39:03Z #moarvm <nwc10> brrt I can see that unbox_u is not in core_templates.expr, and box_u is in neither, and it looks easy to add either/both/whatever, but which JIT is current? And is it right to edit both?

[13:43] <nwc10> and nine answered ti

[13:43] <nwc10> it

[13:45] <brrt> core_templates.expr is the right one?

[13:45] <brrt> what did nine answer atm

[13:46] <nwc10> "The expression jit doesn't cover all situations that the lego jit does. So having both will help"

[13:48] <brrt> yes, this is accurate
