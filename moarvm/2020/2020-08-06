[08:36] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[08:36] <nwc10> [Coke]: you pasted some test failres in https://gist.github.com/coke/cc744eade897aaf23c3d4114b93495ec

[08:36] <nwc10> I can't replicate those. What platform is that, and does master suffer the same failures?

[08:40] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM/YYY-A-Better-Hash: 53 commits pushed by (Nicholas Clark)++

[08:40] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM/YYY-A-Better-Hash: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/69007dbc5034^...a8241f5c9764

[08:41] <jnthn> good moarning o/

[08:41] <tellable6> hey jnthn, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/cae0675546cb02a85526e49ae1984d81

[08:41] <nwc10> hi.

[08:41] <nwc10> (Almost) ships passing in the night

[08:42] <nwc10> in that, we're heading out to a far away place with poor mobile coverage at lunchtime

[08:42] <nwc10> [no, not Germany :-)]

[08:42] <nwc10> so, you were about to get a pull request (For the purpose of tracking the problems)

[08:42] <nwc10> the sodbag works. And it's faster. But/until

[08:42] <nwc10> I was paranoid, and we've exposed an existing data race (described somewhere in scrollback)

[08:43] <nwc10> and this morning I tried just eliminating MVM_CF_HAS_OBJECT_ID

[08:43] <nwc10> and it's about a 10% slowdown

[08:43] <nwc10> *some* of that can be won back with the last known not-yet-done optimisation for the hash implementation. But not 10%

[08:44] <nwc10> so, bother, seems to be "Atomic ops" needed. At least for write barrierers and object IDs

[08:44] <nwc10> or am I cofnused and you're still on holiday, but temporarily in some "non holiday" Monad

[08:59] <lizmat> nwc10: it's my understanding that jnthn is back from holiday, but also at $work now

[09:00] <nwc10> I hope that there aren't too many coffee slicks to clear up there.

[09:01] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: nwc10++ created pull request #1334: YYY a better hash

[09:01] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1334

[09:01] <nwc10> nine: could you check the last paragraph of that draft pull request?

[09:02] <nwc10> I need to go AFK and mow the lawn. Else we will return to a jungle.

[09:58] <jnthn> Yes, I'm back, and catching up on all the things :)

[09:59] <jnthn> What does MVM_CF_HAS_OBJECT_ID race with, ooc?

[09:59] <jnthn> oh, right, I should find the scrollback :)

[10:23] <nwc10> scrollback link in that PR

[10:23] <nwc10> and of anyone here, I think nine understands it best

[10:23] <nwc10> and I'm mostly not here

[10:23] <nwc10> and soon (until Monday) very not here

[10:25] <jnthn> Long weekend vacation? :)

[11:04] <nwc10> roughly this. Although I'm not sure how relaxing it will be

[12:48] <[Coke]> nwc10: those results were from my mac.

[12:48] <[Coke]> ... and I see there was just another push, so I can kick off another mac run.

[12:49] <[Coke]> updating to latest rakudo/nqp/moarvm-your-branch and rebuilding.

[12:50] *** zakharyas joined
[12:50] <[Coke]> btw, do we can about const char warnings?

[12:51] <[Coke]> I remember back in the day, I think it was Andy Lester purging them from parrot

[13:20] <[Coke]> nwc10: same errors. Let me try against a non-nwc build and see if it's you or not.

[13:20] <[Coke]> s/same/similar, at least/

[13:42] *** MasterDuke joined
[13:47] <[Coke]> nwc10: unfortunately, the failures occur only with your branch.

[13:51] <[Coke]> nwc10: https://gist.github.com/coke/353adbf0ab607c1dc2ae95b4847e312f - though I see the mainline dev is using a detached head on MoarVM. let me know if I need to force that to be updated.

[16:39] <timotimo> it's easy to see how removing one line from X gives you Y, but when you remove another, what do you get? I? |? V?

[17:06] <[Coke]>  /

[17:07] <[Coke]> you just need the right font.

[17:08] <[Coke]> ugh. --force-rebuild (build everything anyway as is) is still (correctly) overridden by specifying a branch on the config invocation, so i've tested XXX branch 3 times now instead of the YYY branch. trying one last time...
