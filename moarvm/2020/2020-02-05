[00:20] <jnthn> Wonder what keeps us from deleting them entirely...

[00:23] <timotimo> "block with cuid BLAH failed to show up"

[00:24] <timotimo> i guess i can just toss that out and see what happens :P

[00:25] <lizmat> in the past, I've seen that message every now and then

[13:17] <brrt> :-)

[13:21] <brrt> I looked into it... it seems that we have 4 classes of labels:

[13:21] <brrt> - for graph start and end

[13:21] <brrt> - for basic blocks

[13:22] <brrt> - for individual instructions

[13:23] <brrt> - internal to expression trees

[13:23] <brrt> within all of these classes, labels all increase

[13:35] <jnthn> So we can use going to a smaller label in order to detect a back-branch?

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: The name is held per code object, meaning different closures may carry a

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: different name. This is notably true of auto-generated `proto` methods.

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: However, we did not preserve this during serialization, meaning that

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Raku language users could see things like AUTOGEN showing up in both

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: backtraces and introspection. Fix this by serializing the name along

[15:52] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: with the closure. This, one a spectest is added, will let us resolve

[16:05] <timotimo> oooooh that is why that happens!

[16:06] <Guest47772> what, is jnthn at it again, hooray :)

[16:19] <jnthn> Doing some easy things to get back into the code :)

[16:19] <Guest47772> very cool

[16:20] <Guest47772> so you're cherry picking the bugs then :)

[16:21] <jnthn> Yeah. :)
