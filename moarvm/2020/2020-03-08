[16:16] <dogbert17> Sometimes the t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t fails but when trying to repro it usually works. Has anyone else seen this?

[16:18] <dogbert17> I managed to catch it once and the error message was:

[16:18] <dogbert17> Type check failed for return value; expected Buf:D but got Slip (Empty)

[16:18] <dogbert17>   in block  at t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t line 34

[16:18] <dogbert17>   in block <unit> at t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t line 31

[16:19] <dogbert17> nine: do you have any insights?

[16:34] <lizmat> dogbert17: actually talked about this with nine at GPaRW, afaik he also has no idea how that can be...

[16:41] <dogbert17> lizmat: thanks, so we need more information in order to figure out what's going on then

[16:47] <lizmat> nine assumed some type of hash order dependency

[16:48] <lizmat> but I was just thinking, maybe it could be time dependent, in the sense of something happening in different seconds which usually happens in the same second

[17:05] <dogbert17> but should a hash order dependency problem lead to the test crashing rather than failing?

[17:07] <lizmat> indeed...  one wonders

[17:45] <dogbert17> the test has now failed twice for me (after many runs) and both times the erroneous md5sum has been identical
