[09:12] <lizmat> nwc10 o/

[09:12] <lizmat> hope everybody's doing well

[09:14] <nwc10> well, I will declare "POETS" in under an hour, hopefully also with enough code pushed to a branch that the rest of it is safely "SEP"

[09:14] <nwc10> (acronyms everywhere)

[09:14] <nwc10> but the "SEP" thing didn't work last time, when I had a week off, and Someone Else hadn't made any progress in the week I was away

[09:32] <timotimo> ah

[09:33] <nwc10> well, more usually writen as "POETS day" to make it sound innocent and sophisticated

[12:44] <nwc10> o/

[13:26] <nine> I think we should replace tc->compiling_scs with just a tc->compiling_sc. The stack of serialization contexts can be just as well managed in HLL land. The VM is only ever interested in the top most SC. This would speed up MVM_sc_wb_hit_obj a bit and make it easer to clean up after a failed compilation

[13:27] <brrt> I ... need to look at that code in order to say something useful

[13:27] <brrt> though it certainly sounds plausible :-)

[16:28] <nwc10> is that really the intcache?

[16:29] * lizmat doesn't know of any HLL magic that would do that

[16:29] <nwc10> I really don't know much at all, but the MoarVM intcache in intcache.c is only for values from -1 to 15

[16:33] <[Coke]> m: my $a = 42; my int $b = 42; $a does role { method Str() { "foo" } }; $b.Str.say

[16:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[16:35] <nwc10> m: my $a = 42; my int $b = 42; $a does role { method Str() { "foo" } }; $b.Str.say

[16:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[16:35] <nwc10> m: my $a = 1; my int $b = 1; $a does role { method Str() { "foo" } }; $b.Str.say

[16:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[16:36] <nwc10> OK, that's the intcache. Righto. So there are two different bugs, it seems

[16:41] <lizmat> m: my $a = 42; my $b = 42; $a does role { method Str() { "foo" } }; dd Int.^name

[16:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «"Int"␤»

[16:41] <lizmat> m: my $a = 42; my $b = 42; $a does role { method Str() { "foo" } }; dd $a.^name

[16:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «"Int+\{<anon|1>}"␤»

[16:42] <lizmat> right
