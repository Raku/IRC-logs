[15:08] <timotimo> it occurs to me i don't think i've touched spesh in a while

[15:13] <japhb> timotimo: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1229  # If you're looking for something with only moderate gnarliness with immediate benefit.  ;-)

[15:23] <timotimo> you call that moderately gnarly? :o

[15:24] <timotimo> well, i haven't had much contact with these parts of moar/nqp

[15:34] <japhb> timotimo: What would you estimate it then, if not 'moderately gnarly'?  I mean, spesh I think pretty much owns "very gnarly", and PEA I think jnthn would agree is off the deep end of "indescribably gnarly", so everything else is going to be less gnarly by comparison, but then again any time you're doing async I/O that needs to be plumbed through several layers, it can't be trivial.

[15:38] *** Kaiepi joined
[15:39] <timotimo> ha

[15:40] *** Kaiepi left
[15:40] <timotimo> well, spesh can sometimes be a meditative experience

[15:41] <timotimo> actually i've amassed a few things i've been meaning to put into spesh that were all for some reason not doable at that very moment

[15:41] <timotimo> more than two of them i've stumbled upon multiple times

[15:42] <timotimo> the debugserver has some things to be implemented, maybe that's a thing i should look into soon-ish as well

[15:42] <timotimo> OTOH i've still got stuff to do with moarperf

[15:52] <japhb> .oO( No rest for the wicked ... )

[15:56] <timotimo> i just jumped into Terminal-Print's examples dir and ran the hilbert script

[15:56] <timotimo> i find it too slow

[16:08] <lizmat> and another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/01/27/2020-04-almost-springtime/

[16:23] <japhb> timotimo: Link?  We don't have a hilbert script ...

[16:24] <timotimo> oh?

[16:25] <timotimo> seems like it's local only

[16:25] <timotimo> then who wrote it?

[16:26] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/fe09badf375142c1a5d6b6d1ea950192

[16:29] <japhb> timotimo: Just based on the first few lines, I suspect someone started with this: https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/examples/mandelbrot-pixels.p6

[16:32] *** domidumont left
[16:33] <timotimo> did ... did i write that code?

[16:41] <japhb> timotimo: It's certainly a possibility.  :-)

[16:43] <japhb> And FWIW, mandelbrot-pixels is relatively snappy on my machine, so I suspect there's a lot that could be tuned out of the hilbert script if you're finding it slow; they're not terribly dissimilar complexity-wise I would think.

[16:46] *** sena_kun left
[16:50] <timotimo> yeah that is very fast

[18:11] <nwc10> jnthn: interesting. So far with a reply from a "Senior Principal Software Engineer". I wonder if he is a singleton, or if he is the tier below a "Most Senior Principal Software Engineer". It all seems very much title inflation

[18:18] *** Ven`` joined
[18:46] *** sena_kun left
[18:55] <japhb> nwc10: At my dayjob, "Senior Principal" is pronounced "Distinguished", but at a large SWE company, that can totally be a thing.  ("Principal" and "Distinguished" are director-level positions, except still doing software eng instead of people management.)
