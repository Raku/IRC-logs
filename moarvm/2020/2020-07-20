[01:45] <timotimo> random observation of the day: we don't spesh MVM_BOOL_MODE_CALL_METHOD yet, and it uses special_return, causing many short-lived small allocations via malloc; the special return data doesn't have a field for "size" yet, though, so can't just use the fsa for it. we can, however, put in a sneaky little cache that could hold one blob of memory for special return data in the thread context

[01:45] <timotimo> optimum would of course be to spesh directly to an invocation that can then be inlined

[09:08] <jnthn> timotimo: I think the special return is going to move onto the callstack

[09:08] <jnthn> timotimo: And it can be a variable size frame and allocate what it wants to there

[13:08] <timotimo> whenever i don't know what i'm doing, the cat comes and lies down on my desk to get scritches. where "i don't know what to do" is defined by "not being able to use my second hand because it's currently scritching the cat"

[13:09] <[Coke]> I feel like I've lost the art of that (going and doing something else because I'm temporarily blocked) because of working-from-home

[13:15] * lizmat goes out cycling for 1+ hour pretty each day since the lockdown

[13:15] <lizmat> it helps

[13:19] <[Coke]> I need to do *something* to get out. :|

[13:24] <lizmat> I can tell you, cycling is doing something (especially as I do *not* have an ebike)

[18:24] <timotimo> not terribly many changes this time around, everything's in branches

[18:26] <sena_kun> Yes, the release is not so big this time, though I still managed to get in troubles.

[18:26] <tellable6> 2020-07-20T17:52:54Z #raku-dev <patrickb> sena-kun: Is the release now unblocked?

[18:27] <patrickb> Well, basically *I* managed to get you in troubles...

[18:27] <sena_kun> patrickb, you rescued the release with your fix. ;)

[18:28] <sena_kun> Anyway, moar is mostly done, now fun with rakudo starts... Hopefully it'll be faster than usual this time.

[18:29] <patrickb> I'm still not completely sure the fallout was caused by the fix for `--profile` id did, but it's the most obvious candidate. In any case I definitely didn't see the fallout coming when merging the PR so close to the release.

[18:30] <patrickb> But still - It was probably me...

[19:50] <nine> lizmat: I just realized: the Raku "core team" consists of committers to an implementation, but not of committers to the language, i.e. roast

[19:51] <lizmat> hmmm... 

[19:51] <lizmat> adding committers to roast to the election, would be .. interesting?

[19:52] <lizmat> but you have a point!
