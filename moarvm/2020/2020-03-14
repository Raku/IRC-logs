[19:35] <nine> Oh darn....my compiler warnings fix is actually broken

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 2252a95df9 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/core/interp.c

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Revert "Fix variable might be clobbered by ‘longjmp’ or ‘vfork’ warnings in interp.c"

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This reverts commit bc06f9630fd09b0064eeaafcd6b189e5f9b4acea.

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: As valgrind helpfully pointed out, with this change we were reading local

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: variables of a (C) frame that was no longer on the stack. In contrast to what

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the compiler warns about, this led to demonstrable failures in new Inline::Perl5

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: code. So better revert and search for a proper fix.

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2252a95df9

[19:46] <nine> The good new is that this actually fixes the weird issues I still got with Inline::Perl5's new support for raku and v5-inline blocks

[19:49] <nine> So this now actually works: raku -I. -e 'note "raku"; { use v5-inline; use v5.10.0; say "Perl 5"; raku { note "raku"; { use v5-inline; use v5.10.0; say "Perl 5"; raku { note "raku"; }; say "Perl 5";}; note "raku"; }; say "Perl 5"; }; note "raku"'

[19:52] <lizmat> wow  :-)

[19:52] *** Guest88981 is now known as timotimo

[19:57] <nine> With that working, I'm now very tempted to use the rest of the evening to watch Outbreak (1995) ;)

[19:58] <lizmat> hehe...

[19:58] <nwc10> I think you've earned it

[19:59] <lizmat> please do, there is nothing good on the channels  / TV or IRC
