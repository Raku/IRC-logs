[11:40] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1259: JIT nextdispatcherfor

[15:07] <timotimo> MasterDuke: it adds takenextdispatcherfor as well as nextdispatcherfor to the graph.c switch/case; is there already an implementation of the take* op in emit.dasc but it just wasn't exposed before?

[15:09] <MasterDuke> yeah

[15:10] <timotimo> OK

[18:21] <timotimo> you know, it'd be kind of cool if we could have a breakpoint based on "some encoder gets a specific string added to its buffer"

[18:22] <timotimo> like, "in this tree of processes i'm seeing something say 'lolwtfbbq' but i can't figure out in which process and where it happens"

[18:23] <timotimo> so you could set an env var "STRING_OUTPUT_BREAKPOINT" or so to a string you want to look for

[18:23] <timotimo> and all moarvms will start with debugging enabled on their own port

[18:23] <timotimo> and when the breakpoint is hit, maybe it outputs the PID and debugger port or something?

[18:25] <timotimo> also, a solution for having multiple processes reachable through just one port - even if it just means new debugserver instances connect to the existing port if it is already taken and tell them what their own port is?

[18:26] *** zakharyas left
[18:26] <timotimo> but you can't yet get fork-execed moarvm instances to inherit debugserver settings, since it's only doing commandline arguments, not, for example, environment variables
