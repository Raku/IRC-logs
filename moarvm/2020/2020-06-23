[09:52] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[09:54] <nine> MasterDuke: I think spesh plugins are going to be replaced by the new dispatch architecture. So probably not...

[09:55] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[19:34] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1320: Add JIT templates for return_(i|n|s)

[19:34] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1320

[19:43] <timotimo> MasterDuke: are the BBs that have return_* in them usually big or small?

[19:43] <MasterDuke> no idea. can take a look

[19:44] <timotimo> i have one example speshlog right now that only has return_* in some parts of qast

[19:44] <timotimo> those are all single-BB functions, though, which is cool

[19:44] <timotimo> they are now all exprjitted from front to back

[19:45] <MasterDuke> a couple are small (1-4), a couple are bigger (40-80)

[19:45] <timotimo> what measurement unit is that?

[19:45] <MasterDuke> well, just number of BBs

[19:46] *** sivoais left
[19:49] <timotimo> oh, i meant to ask how big the BB is that has the return_* in it

[19:49] <timotimo> in theory, the bigger the BB the more there is to gain from exprjit

[19:51] <MasterDuke> between 1 and 16 instructions i've seen so far

[19:52] <MasterDuke> most are about 4

[19:58] <MasterDuke> huh. why does the overview say 636442 deopts, but the deopts tab shows far fewer (around 200k)?

[19:59] <MasterDuke> fwiw, it shows the most at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/List.pm6#L99
