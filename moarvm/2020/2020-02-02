[17:43] <MasterDuke> hm. https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1233 is failing because "mp_set_double implementation is only available on platforms with IEEE754 floating point format". however, it appears we're assuming IEEE754 anyway according to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1233/files#diff-da7d01bcfced11bccf24e9234758e807L58

[17:44] <MasterDuke> i can always just back out the part of the change that uses mp_set_double(), but are we still susceptible to problems in our custom code?

[20:32] <MasterDuke> isn't this dangerous? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L974-L976

[20:33] <MasterDuke> shouldn't we be using mp_init_copy()? otherwise we're just copying the mp_int, not the stuff that may be inside it?

[21:23] <timotimo> MasterDuke: it doesn't get mp_copy'd here because the body would otherwise disappear when the function is left, due to being put onto the stack

[21:24] <timotimo> i'm not sure why alloca is used here, i think it could just be "mp_int i" and use &i whenever it's mentioned

[21:24] <timotimo> i think there's also an mp_clear missing before the second exception throw there

[22:11] <MasterDuke> re mp_clear, yeah, i have a new commit i'm just about to push that adds mp_clears everywhere where missing

[22:14] <MasterDuke> timotimo: but then shouldn't it be mp_copy+memcpy?

[22:26] <MasterDuke> wait. you mean the MVMP6bigintBody *body would disappear?

[22:29] <MasterDuke> i'm thinking the else block should be: mp_int *i_cpy = MVM_malloc(sizeof(mp_int)); mp_init_copy(i_cpy, i); body->u.bigint = i_cpy;
