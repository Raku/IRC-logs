[08:37] <timotimo> nine: okay, hear me out on this one ... how about we have a little debug function that spits out a struct definition as equivalent of a p6opaque so we can cast the body of a p6opaque and have gdb do everything it normally does

[09:27] *** zakharyas left
[09:36] *** leont joined
[09:49] <nine> That could be very useful since you then can follow those pointers easily

[09:49] <nine> I think both solutions have their place

[18:28] <brrt> tea-time, by chance :-)

[18:39] <nwc10> yes, tea.

[18:39] <nwc10> the upcoming cocde (possibly tomorrow) might look like it's crack-fuelled, but actually it's powered by lapsang souchong

[18:44] <[Coke]> ... those are, apparently... words.

[18:51] * [Coke] drinks his very US-ian diet soda.

[19:23] <brrt> lapsang souchong is .. something different

[19:24] <lizmat> aahhh... the smell of wet ashtrays

[19:25] *** sena_kun joined
[19:26] <nwc10> :-)

[19:27] <timotimo> oh, wet ashtrays? reminds me of "first time trying club mate"

[19:27] *** Altai-man left
[19:33] <[Coke]> last time I was in the .eu, I wonder how much I spent on Coke Zero from the local pizza place.

[19:34] * [Coke] wonders how long it'll be before he gets to travel again.

[19:34] *** zakharyas joined
[19:49] <timotimo> who let the coke out?

[20:24] <[Coke]> no one since the first week of march. :)

[20:44] <timotimo> oh, did the ides of march bring anything at all?

[20:48] <nwc10> Found that less than an hour ago. It's my fault. I think that it's a blocker (well, it's the fix for a blocker)

[20:48] <timotimo> whoops

[20:49] <nwc10> tiny whoops. but as it's getting GC marking wrong, it could have messy effects

[20:49] <timotimo> yes

[20:50] <timotimo> good thing we haven't released it yet; who is our garbage collector torture tester? ;) ;) ;)

[20:50] <nwc10> Yes, "not released yet" seems to justify "blocker"

[20:51] <nwc10> anyway, it should be the fix, if I figured it out correctly. (Found by inspection because I was looking to change that code)

[20:51] <nwc10> I need to go to bed.

[20:51] <timotimo> :+1:

[20:51] <timotimo> have a good sleep
