[13:56] * dogbert17 is still dabbling with the eval bug

[14:00] <dogbert17> seems as if it is this variable attribute which is somehow getting busted: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/src/how/NQPClassHOW.nqp#L742

[14:04] <dogbert17> the code often fails with the msg 'Iteration past end of iterator' and --ll-exception points to https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/src/how/NQPClassHOW.nqp#L750

[14:05] <dogbert17> at the MoarVM level we're at this line https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/MVMIter.c#L56

[14:07] <dogbert17> when the program fails more violently, i.e. SEGV or ASAN barfage it happens in array related code, i.e. VMArray.c

[16:08] <lizmat> nwc10++   # fixing the JS build

[16:31] <nwc10> well, yes-and-no

[16:31] <nwc10> half fixing it

[16:34] <lizmat> well, noticing it and working on it then  :-)

[16:36] <nwc10> unfortunately, I don't think that I can fix the second problem that I found -- https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/656

[16:36] <nwc10> so not working further on that.
