[09:24] <dogbert17> hello nwc10

[09:25] <dogbert17> stumbled upon this yesterday: 'MoarVM oops: insert conflict, 0x7f5ef3c3a4a8 is 3510, 94302813922024 != 94302813921976'

[09:25] <dogbert17> when running: while ./perl6-m -Ilib t/spec/S17-lowlevel/cas.t; do :; done

[13:40] <nwc10> dogbert17: yes, sorry, didn't respond. Been AFK a lot. Have (after a *lot* of looping) replicated it

[13:40] <nwc10> Has to be some sort of (existing) bug in the GC that I've now exposed.

[13:41] <nwc10> and ASAN has just got very excited about the other thing that I saw, but now I can replicate that on master

[15:03] <dogbert17> nwc10: it seems to fail inside the following call: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/XXX-A-Better-Hash/src/gc/objectid.c#L28
