[09:42] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[10:20] <nwc10> All tests successful.

[10:20] <nwc10> Files=145, Tests=13359, 63104 wallclock secs (17.15 usr  3.74 sys + 178776.99 cusr 506.76 csys = 179304.64 CPU)

[10:20] <nwc10> that's NQP, with GC_DEBUG=3

[10:20] <nwc10> so, most of a day

[10:20] <nwc10> for the tests, and more than a day for the build.

[10:21] <nwc10> what's with

[10:21] <nwc10> +++ Compiling   NQPP5QRegex.moarvm

[10:21] <nwc10> something must be wrong in the dependencies, as that seems to get recompiled more often than it shoudl

[10:21] <nwc10> (some hours later, my install might complete)

[20:42] <bartolin> I've just stumbled above this segfault:

[20:42] <bartolin> m: use nqp; my %h; say nqp::existskey(%h, "Foo")

[20:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85320f466: OUTPUT: «(signal SEGV)»

[20:43] <bartolin> it seems to happen on line 1478 in src/6model/reprs/P6opaque.c (del is NULL)

[20:44] <bartolin> there is similar code for other functions (at_key, etc.)

[20:45] <bartolin> should I open an issue in MoarVM for this?

[21:26] <timotimo> missing concreteness check, eh?

[21:27] <timotimo> in the future i think we'll be using the dispatch mechanism so that moar 1) does the checking without us putting it everywhere and 2) can toss out the check if spesh can prove it's not needed

[21:28] <timotimo> ^- use the dispatcher mechanism for repr ops like {at,exists,bind}{key,pos} and friends

[21:32] <bartolin> that sounds promising. so, it's not worth to look at this now?

[21:33] <timotimo> possibly
