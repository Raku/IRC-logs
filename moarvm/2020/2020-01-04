[11:54] *** Altai-man_ left
[11:55] <nine> Can we please have a release? Over the past few weeks I've fixed all the issues that plagued us at work and when business opens again on Tuesday, I'd like us to be able to move past them.

[11:58] <sena_kun> nine, is val-related blocker fixed?

[11:58] <sena_kun> or another option is to revert that

[11:59] <sena_kun> s/that/changes/

[11:59] <nine> I'm pretty sure that can be reverted in a release branch

[11:59] <sena_kun> nine, ok. is there anyone in moarvm team who can do a release with github tags, signs and so on if I'll green light it?

[12:00] <sena_kun> if "yes", then I'd go for it

[12:00] <nine> If there were, we'd probably have had a 2019.12 release :/

[12:01] <nine> I know jnthn and samcv could do releases, but neither have been really here for some time

[12:02] <sena_kun> ok, let me draft a plan of actions and starting preparations then...

[12:07] <sena_kun> nine, I am bumping moar/nqp

[12:15] <nine> ok

[12:19] <sena_kun> lizmat, ping?

[12:23] <lizmat> pong

[12:23] *** sivoais left
[12:23] <lizmat> sena_kun: pong

[12:24] <sena_kun> lizmat, o/

[12:24] <sena_kun> I guess we are aiming for a release, will it be comfortable for you to revert val-related changes in a release branch and then continue to work on it after it'd be merged?

[12:28] <sena_kun> to clarify, the release branch is not created yet. :)

[12:28] * sena_kun run spec after bumping

[12:30] <lizmat> sena_kun: if I revert the val work, then we need to revert the test changes as well

[12:30] <lizmat> as otherwise we will see massive failures

[12:30] <lizmat> both can be done

[12:31] <sena_kun> lizmat, nice! I'll ping you when release branch will be available

[12:31] <lizmat> grrr

[12:31] <sena_kun> as for test changes - sure, roast revert is a sure option too

[12:31] <sena_kun> hmm?

[12:31] <lizmat> I seem to not be able to just revert it

[12:32] <lizmat> it doesn't tell me why

[12:32] <lizmat> ah, looks like I need to resolve some conflicts

[12:33] <sena_kun> lizmat, you don't need to rush, we don't have a branch yet anyway

[12:34] <lizmat> lemme see if I can fix the num stress test, I had an idea last night

[12:34] <sena_kun> lizmat, as in, resolve the blocker without revert?

[12:35] <lizmat> yeah

[12:35] <sena_kun> lizmat, good luck!

[12:36] <sena_kun> fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/perl6/nqp/': The requested URL returned error: 403

[12:36] <sena_kun> eeeeh

[12:37] <sena_kun> can anyone please check if I have right to commit to nqp?

[12:37] <sena_kun> hmm, maybe that's my settings..

[12:44] <lizmat> ok, that idea doesn't work  :-(

[12:45] <nine> sena_kun: sorry, don't seem to have admin privileges on any of our repos

[12:45] <sena_kun> lizmat, sigh, that's sad. maybe you can help with checking rights on nqp repo though?

[12:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 83393ef5a9 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | docs/ChangeLog

[12:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Update release name in ChangeLog

[12:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/83393ef5a9

[12:46] <lizmat> sena_kun: where should I look ?

[12:46] <sena_kun> lizmat, nqp repo, settings are, hmmm...

[12:46] <lizmat> and then?

[12:47] <lizmat> I'm collaborators and teams

[12:47] <lizmat> Seems I have "write" privileges on nqp

[12:47] <lizmat> no maintain or admin

[12:48] <sena_kun> :S

[12:48] <sena_kun> whatever, I'll do a PR, I guess...

[12:50] <sena_kun> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/594 <-

[12:50] <sena_kun> I also can't accept PRs, so yes, it seems I don't have write access

[12:51] <lizmat> merged the PR

[12:51] <nine> lizmat: looks like the flapping is actually a JIT bug!

[12:51] <nine> or not

[12:52] <sena_kun> and rakudo is bumped too. \o/

[12:55] <lizmat> the flapping on the num stress test is my fault

[12:55] <nine> Oh, the test is using random numbers

[12:55] <lizmat> the flaps occur because it doesn't happen for all numbers

[12:55] <lizmat> indeed

[12:56] <nine> That's not good :*

[12:56] <nine> :(

[12:57] <nine> Easiest way for our language implementation to pass that test is to ensure we create the right random numbers that pass...

[13:00] <lizmat> :-)

[13:01] <nine> For the failures it seems to either round in a different direction or add 2 more digits

[13:02] <lizmat> the problem is an extra num --> Str cycle in the new val() logic

[13:02] <lizmat> it appears the only way to create a right enough num from a string, is to actually use nqp::numify

[13:02] <lizmat> rather than taking the parts and doing the calculation

[13:03] <samcv> i can do a release if needed nine

[13:03] <samcv> heya

[13:03] <nine> samcv: please do :)

[13:04] <samcv> okay. will do. give me a few hours
