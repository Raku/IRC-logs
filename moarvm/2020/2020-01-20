[14:47] <Guest78373> interesting, one of Tux csv-test files, i.e. t/45_eol.t upsets valgrind

[14:47] <brrt> \o

[14:48] <Guest78373> hello brrt

[14:48] <brrt> hi Guest78373

[14:50] <brrt> I thought as much

[14:50] <Guest78373> so much for my 'secret' identity :)

[14:52] <nwc10> oh, o/ for this time as well

[14:52] <MasterDuke> oh ha, i first read brrt's "i thought as much" as referring to the location where valgrind complains and was all prepared to be really impressed

[14:55] <brrt> lol

[14:55] <brrt> no, I'm not... I don't know that one :-D

[14:55] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[21:34] <timotimo> hrm. i made the code for saving a lot of space for local variable types a bunch simpler, but it's still wrong

[21:55] <timotimo> how do y'all do it? when you're changing serialization stuff?

[21:55] <timotimo> is it just "don't"? :)
