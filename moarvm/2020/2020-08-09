[15:43] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[15:43] <nwc10> back, half awake, might be more awake tomorrow

[15:44] <nwc10> [Coke]: read your test results - nothing jumps out at me as an obvious "why", and I can't yet see how to go further to try to dig into them. So, tomorrow

[15:46] <nwc10> nine: it occurred to me at some point in the middle of the night - instead of atomic ops, as only 13 flag bits are currently used, could we split flags into two `U8`s, with MVM_CF_HAS_OBJECT_ID in one, MVM_CF_REF_FROM_GEN2 in the other, and the other 11 paritioned in some sane way?

[15:46] <nwc10> (likely all the GC related flags in the same "side" of the parition as MVM_CF_REF_FROM_GEN2, and most of the rest in the other side)

[15:46] <nwc10> I have not tested this thought experiment, other than counting flag bits.
