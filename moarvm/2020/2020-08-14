[07:47] <samcv> dogbert17, what commit id is that log from?

[07:57] *** zakharyas joined
[07:59] <samcv> I think you maybe need to investigate each one. Though this page on most common threadsanitizer data races may be helpful https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerPopularDataRaces I'm reading it now

[14:40] <dogbert11> could it be a problem if two threads are trying to write to the same address here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/P6opaque.c#L21

[14:41] <jnthn> Not from the point of view of VM integrity, no

[14:41] <dogbert11> so they can't clobber something

[14:42] <nwc10> jnthn: I hope that your beer fridge operative is doing better than mine - I am now drinking the only cold beer that was in the fridge.

[14:43] <nwc10> next release is in 4 days?

[14:44] <dogbert11> jnthn, nwc10: here's a gist showing the (non existing ?) problem: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/36d5c6e2d78cc04557d695d8ea243bdd

[14:46] <nwc10> I still don't feel at all comfortable with "what tsan is trying to tell me"

[14:46] <nwc10> but I saw a lot of output from ubsan that I think I can address.

[14:46] <dogbert11> alignment stuff?

[14:47] <nwc10> yes

[14:47] <dogbert11> perhaps tsan is one big false positive :-)

[14:47] <nwc10> my face doesn't fit into ASCII

[14:47] <nwc10> I suspect that mostly it is not

[14:49] <dogbert11> the output above is from on old example written by jnthn: perl6-m -e "await (^80).map({ start { EVAL '/0|1|2/' } }); say 'ok'"

[14:50] <dogbert11> it has a tendency to fail

[14:51] <samcv> dogbert11, what arguments do you compile tsan with? I tried "./Configure.pl --prefix=$HOME/raku --compiler=clang --tsan --debug" but I get this error on starting nqp/raku "MoarVM: Initialization of GC start condition variable failed"

[14:52] <dogbert11> samcv: perl Configure.pl --debug --tsan --prefix=../../install/   # I'm using gcc

[15:01] <jnthn> nwc10: Hm, I fear there is only one in it at home too, though there's plenty of others I can add :)

[15:10] *** zakharyas joined
[15:17] <jnthn> uh-oh, getting home might become interesting, though

[15:17] <jnthn> (huge storm just started)

[16:15] <samcv> jnthn, same here

[16:21] <jnthn> By now it's "light rain" but I'm still not so excited to walk in it...

[16:29] *** dogbert11 joined
[16:29] <nwc10> still blue skies and fluffy clouds here, but we can hear thunder

[16:30] <nwc10> and the final section of the lawn is now seeded.
