[13:26] <MasterDuke> huh. my libmoar.so is linked against /usr/lib/libgmp. no wonder it wasn't picking up my changes to gmp when i was doing that

[13:28] <MasterDuke> i have `-L./3rdparty/gmp -lgmp`, why isn't it picking up the libgmp.so there?

[13:40] <timotimo> could be the wrong order

[13:48] <lizmat> is there a reason to not bump MoarVM at this time?  getting nwc10's hash fixes / improvements ?

[13:49] <nwc10> well, you won't get much, as most things aren't in master yet

[13:50] <lizmat> well, at least it will get a bit of a workout ?  but if you think it's too early really, then I'll leave it  :-)

[13:51] <nwc10> oh wait, I'm confused.

[13:51] <nwc10> there are *some* things in master

[13:51] <nwc10> yes, they'd be useful

[13:52] <lizmat> ok, will bump then

[13:53] <MasterDuke> ok, if i add an additional -rpath argument to point to ./3rdparty/gmp then my MoarVM/libmoar.so points there. but the one in my --prefix which rakudo uses still points to the system gmp

[13:54] <timotimo> i assume you already put the installation piece in?

[13:54] <timotimo> LD_DEBUG=file (or so) may help figure this out

[13:55] <timotimo> nwc10: so where are we at with the hash; is the whole hash storage now one allocation? are a few bits of the hash now in the metadata place?

[13:56] <nwc10> the former

[13:56] <nwc10> (one allocation. cachegrind does seem to like it)

[13:56] <MasterDuke> find library=libgmp.so.10 [0]; searching

[13:56] <nwc10> the latter is not ready for prime time

[13:56] <MasterDuke> search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache

[13:56] <MasterDuke> trying file=/usr/lib/libgmp.so.10

[13:56] <timotimo> cachegrind is only for performance, tho?

[13:57] <timotimo> or do you mean that it's better?

[13:57] <nwc10> yes. correctness is there. performance makes no sense.

[13:57] <nwc10> but I'd not realised that I need to disable spesh

[13:57] <timotimo> disable or NODELAY and BLOCKING

[13:57] <timotimo> otherwise performance will be very wobbly

[13:58] <nwc10> I know this *now*. I didn't 24 hours ago :-)

[13:58] <timotimo> d'oh

[13:58] <nwc10> actually, make that 6 hours ago. not 24.

[13:59] <timotimo> what can possibly be difficult about the hash-bits-in-metadata change? ;)

[14:00] <nwc10> a lot more than I expected.

[14:04] <MasterDuke> timotimo: what installation piece did you mean?

[14:07] <timotimo> that it gets copied over to where-ever we expect it to be at runtime

[14:14] <timotimo> nwc10: so is there a place where i could look at the WIP?

[14:29] <MasterDuke> hm. i guess that's why changing the references to .so in the makefile worked, i just picked up the system ones? because we don't copy the other .a's we build anywhere

[14:39] <nwc10> not yet

[15:33] <nwc10> timotimo: I realised that actually my answer was 50% inaccurate. single block allocation is in a branch, with an open PR

[15:33] <nwc10> you're welcome to look at that. I'd love you to look at that (or anyone who is not me and feels competant)

[15:36] <[Coke]> I am at least not you, but that's all I have here.
