[17:39] <patrickb> timotimo: WRT https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/17

[17:44] <patrickb> timotimo: Can you have a look at this change: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/645

[17:45] <patrickb> It relies on $NQP_HOME to be set in the context (not sure what context that actually is). The variable is currently only set in rakudo though: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/main.nqp#L51

[17:47] <patrickb> Would this PR actually work when running rakudo?

[17:52] <patrickb> I suspect it won't as it's a different HLL.

[20:28] <timotimo> patrickb: do you happen to know what other place calculates the path? does it happen in the C launcher or something?

[20:28] <timotimo> since the template path stuff happens after the raku code runs, we can put path calculation in raku code as well

[20:28] <timotimo> and the hll at a given place in the code is statically based on what compiles it; that piece of code is compiled by nqp so it'll have nqp set as the hll

[20:29] <timotimo> we probably also have ops to get symbols from another hll by its name

[20:30] <patrickb> In rakudo the C runner does some ground work to determine the executable path (and calculates the home dirs, but only for internal use). Then the src/main.nqp and src/rakudo-debug.nqp files determine the home dirs and set up those hll symbols.

[20:30] *** sena_kun left
[20:30] <patrickb> The NQP C runner does the same.

[20:31] <patrickb> The NQP src/NQP/Compiler.nqp does not set up the HLL symbol though (I added that in one of the above PRs)

[20:33] <patrickb> The thing that worries me a bit in my PRs is that code in NQP relies on the NQP_HOME HLL symbol, which needs to be set up in rakudos src/main.nqp.

[20:33] <patrickb> I also set it up in NQPs src/NQP/Compiler.nqp, but that is never called when running Rakudo.

[21:36] <timotimo> right, rakudo's compiler derives from HLL::Compiler, not NQP::Compiler

[22:04] <patrickb> So I could put the logic into HLL::Compiler and leave it out in rakudo? That would clean things up a bit!

[22:07] <patrickb> But where would I put it there? Sounds a bit out of place to put it into BUILD or some such...

[22:18] *** patrickb left
[22:19] *** patrickz left
[22:21] <timotimo> i mean, it could just go in a method i guess?
