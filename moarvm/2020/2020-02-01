[17:51] <patrickb> o/

[17:51] <patrickb> I'm currently looking at the dyncall 3rdparty submodule. Version 1.1 got released recently and I'd like to update.

[17:53] <patrickb> When looking at the git history it seems as older updates actually imported the mercurial commits while the two more recent bumps just copied all the files in.

[17:54] <patrickb> Does that mean, that there are actually no changes between the official mercurial dyncall repo and the github.com/MoarVM/dyncall git repo?

[17:55] <patrickb> Is updating as easy as replacing the entire working directory of the dyncall git repo with the respective mercurial commit and commiting the result (and loosing any potential changes there might possibly have been in our repo)?
