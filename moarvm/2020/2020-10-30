[03:15] <[Coke]> nine: I imagine you'd also be a good person to ask about the sc opcodes. If you have any notes for https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/527, I'd really appreciate it.

[13:48] <[Coke]> are the tools/.py files in MoarVM mainly for working with a GCC lib?

[13:50] *** vrurg left
[13:51] <nine> tools/check-roots.py and tools/check-throw-without-free.py are gcc plugins

[13:52] *** vrurg joined
[13:53] <timotimo> tools/moar-gdb.py can be loaded into gdb to have some helpful functions and such
