[18:21] <MasterDuke> two things i saw in HN today: https://github.com/carolemieux/perffuzz (a modified afl that finds input to detect performance problems) and https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05599 (experimenting with sorting networks for the base case of sorting algorithms)

[18:51] <MasterDuke> nine: i was doing a little googling about that setjmp/longjmp clobbering warning. it looks like it's triggered by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d7b6855d35406edf90aa3a49251f6a314374ba2c

[18:52] <MasterDuke> s/it looks/i think without having actually tested that/

[18:53] <MasterDuke> the warning seems to be about values being set that could be overwritten when returning to the site of a setjmp

[18:53] <nine> MasterDuke: oh it's definitely that commit

[18:53] <nine> I just don't know what to do about is

[18:53] <MasterDuke> ah

[18:57] <nine> Well I'm pretty sure a refactor thaf moves around a lot of the code would fix it...
