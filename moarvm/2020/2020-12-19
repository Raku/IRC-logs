[10:49] <Altai-man> anything preventing the release last minute?

[10:51] <lizmat> 1 blocker ?

[10:51] * lizmat has no idea what the blocker is

[10:54] <Altai-man> I know about this one, but moarvm folks had no resources to resolve that and we can skip it yet another time.

[10:55] <Altai-man> It is more of a "It would be just super awesome, you know, like really great if we do it this release", not "Critical failures ahead" type of blocker.

[10:55] <Altai-man> Sigh, moarvm changelog.

[10:55] <lizmat> I see, then there's no reason that I know of not to go for it

[10:55] <Altai-man> lizmat++

[11:04] <nine> Looks like a fix for that blocker has already been merged anyway: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4045

[11:04] <nine> The ticket is only still open because we want to have CI support, so we don't regress that again

[11:05] <Altai-man> Technically, the blocker is https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1385 where NQP tests fail on this CI setup.

[11:06] <nine> ah, ok

[11:08] <Altai-man> Anyway, I have no intention of preventing the release due to this or trying to be a slave driver telling people what to do. I think this blocker is an indication that while roast failures are, hmm, present sometimes, as roast is huge, nqp tests have to be more solid, IMO.

[20:47] <MasterDuke> have you looked at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1399 ?

[21:06] <timotimo> am now

[21:10] *** Altai-man left
[21:22] <MasterDuke> thanks. i'd like to get it merged now we're after the release (and i think it's ok as is), but there are those two outstanding questions

[21:26] <timotimo> i assume spec and stress tests are clean?

[21:49] <MasterDuke> yep

[22:20] *** zakharyas left
[22:24] *** sena_kun left
[22:50] <timotimo> can you doublecheck if that one spesh piece of code gets called ever? like by `abort()` so it terminates the test?

[22:57] <MasterDuke> i added printfs and they printed
