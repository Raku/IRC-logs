[17:08] <bartolin_> I'm no longer able to build MoarVM on FreeBSD (11). It seems to be a problem with the new libuv version. The error happens in step 'linking moar': ./libmoar.so: undefined reference to `uv__process_title_cleanup'

[17:11] <timotimo> are you building with system libuv or the subrepo one? if so, which commit is checked out locally for you?

[17:12] <bartolin_> I've removed the system libuv (to be sure), so it should be the subrepo one. I'm on b9fa480ad1.

[17:14] <timotimo> i've got e45f1ec38db882f8dc17b51f51a6684027034609 which is tag: v1.35.0

[17:15] <timotimo> fatal: ambiguous argument 'b9fa480ad1': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.

[17:15] <timotimo> oh that's a moarvm commit

[17:15] <timotimo> can you check "git show" inside of 3rdparty/libuv?

[17:16] <bartolin_> yes, sorry I misunderstood. Its 1ab9ea3790378f9f25c4e78e9e2b511c75f9c9ed (tag v1.38.0)

[17:16] <timotimo> haha, oops, does that mean i'm out of date

[17:16] <bartolin_> there was this update the other day: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b9fa480ad1c2ecbfdab071633d817575b23660e7

[17:16] <bartolin_> yepp

[17:17] * dogbert17 hides

[17:18] <timotimo> all i see mentioning the title_cleanup is a pull request that's not yet merged

[17:30] <dogbert17> bartolin: perhaps your problems are related to this commit https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/72fe3543feb23ae555e08628b70a3fae4da5706c

[17:32] <dogbert17> I'm no expert on build systems but could it be that we need to make some changes to MoarVM/build/Makefile.in given that uv__process_title_cleanup was moved in the above commit

[17:34] * bartolin_ is looking

[17:35] * dogbert17 eyes https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/build/Makefile.in#L480

[17:36] <bartolin_> I'll try to include bsd-proctitle

[17:38] <dogbert17> bartolin: if it works do you think it should be added to the other bsd's as well, e.g. NetBSD?

[17:38] <bartolin_> \o/ that makes the error go away. And yes, looks like we need it for others, too.

[17:38] <bartolin_> I'll try to build Rakudo first. dogbert17++

[18:07] <bartolin_> spectest is still running, but everything looks good so far. I'm not totally sure my changes are good (esp. for OpenBSD and NetBSD), but I suspect the builds on those OSes are failing right now, too

[18:33] <bartolin_> hmm, I've got two failing tests: https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S32-exceptions/misc.t#L467-L469 Looks like the backtrace has 5 instead of 4 elems. That test passed the last time I tried (2020-06-08).

[18:36] <MasterDuke> yeah, same here

[18:37] <bartolin_> ok, thanks!

[18:51] <lizmat> yeah... I've no idea what changed there...  I also couldn't get it bisected  :-(

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: These were introduced by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1291 in

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: However, in some cases the alloced storage had already been attached to

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: GC-managed objects, so if the throw was caught and GC cleaned up the

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: parent object, the storage was freed twice. Fix by only attaching the

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: alloced storage to the parent object after the throw might have

[20:00] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: happened, so it can be safely freed before the throw.

[20:04] <MasterDuke> lizmat, sena_kun: ^^^ afk for a bit, but after a bump json::fast should be good

[20:05] <lizmat> sena_kun: did you start Blin already ?

[20:05] <sena_kun> Yes.

[20:05] <sena_kun> Should I stop?

[20:05] <lizmat> ok, then I'll hold off bumping  :-)

[20:05] <lizmat> no... we know this issue, so if JSON::Fast comes up... we'll know what it its

[20:05] <lizmat> *is

[20:06] <lizmat> or do you prefer getting that fix in as well for the Blin run ?

[20:07] <MasterDuke> it might well have caused problems elsewhere, i'd recommend running with it in

[20:09] * sena_kun has stopped blin

[20:09] <lizmat> ok, will start bumping then

[20:09] <sena_kun> lizmat, thanks.

[20:28] <lizmat> sena_kun: bumped

[20:28] <sena_kun> started again, thanks

[20:29] <lizmat> MasterDuke: sadly this doesn't fix JSON::Fast

[20:29] <lizmat> well, it fixes the panic, but now that test fails

[20:30] * sena_kun tries to bisect it

[20:32] <lizmat> oops, false alarm

[20:32] <lizmat> it's another test that fails

[20:33] * sena_kun just ran blin and went afk

[20:33] <lizmat> and it's a TODO test

[20:33] <lizmat> so JSON::Fast should be ok again
