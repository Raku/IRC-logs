[11:09] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: cognominal++ created pull request #1398: fix #1395 : On Apple Silicon with arch arm64, does not attempt to JIT

[11:09] <linkable6> MOARVM#1395 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1395 Apple Silicon nqp build fails unless MVM_JIT_DISABLE is set

[12:50] <nine> Thinking about that throw-away frame with lexicals for BEGIN time code. The compiler basically knows when a lexical can only be found outside the current comp unit. So I guess it should be able to simply generate different code for accessing those.

[12:53] <nine> But what about when the same code will be executed again at runtime? Right now we go some extra steps to not compile dynamically compiled frames again. But what if we did just do that? The by far most expensive part of compilation - parsing - won't be done again.

[13:01] <nine> Apparently we don't go that extra step in NQP

[13:38] <MasterDuke> we do in rakudo, but not nqp?

[13:44] <nine> yep

[13:44] <nine> A possible reason might be that in NQP there's just a lot less BEGIN time evaluation, so it doesn't matter as mutch. Most common in Raku code are probably role bodies
