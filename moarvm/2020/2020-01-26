[12:34] <MasterDuke> timotimo: you're right, MVM_string_latin1_decode doesn't see nearly as many duplicates, the most are 26

[20:12] <timotimo> are there duplicates when you include which compunit the strings come from?

[20:27] *** Kaiepi left
[20:27] *** Kaeipi joined
[20:33] <MasterDuke> hm, don't think that's available inside MVM_string_latin1_decode (where i was doing my printing)?

[21:02] <timotimo> if you're collecting the data from gdb using breakpoints and commands, it could be stolen from a stack frame further up

[21:02] <timotimo> but that might be a bit annoying

[21:03] <timotimo> you should be able to use at least the caller of latin1_decode, which is potentially MVM_cu_string_obtain or something

[21:05] <timotimo> right now i'm trying vscode with their c/c++ extension

[21:05] <timotimo> seems all right so far

[21:08] <MasterDuke> i've been experimenting with vscode at work. don't like it

[21:09] <MasterDuke> double clicking to select text and copy/paste is incredibly frustrating. it keeps not selecting, so then i past right in the middle instead of replacing

[21:15] *** zakharyas left
[21:51] <timotimo> that does sound very annoying

[22:28] <MasterDuke> huh, compunits don't have an id or name?

[22:28] <MasterDuke> at least, i don't see anything in MVMCompUnit or MVMCompUnitBody

[22:34] <MasterDuke> if the idx passed to MVM_cu_obtain_string is the right thing to use then duplication drops considerably. i.e., highest count is 23 for idx = 1, string = '<mainline>'
