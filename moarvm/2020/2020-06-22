[05:23] <nwc10> timotimo: OK. that wan't obvious. I'd found that you had a fork of the repositiory, but it seems that all your commits in master are merged into upstream.

[05:33] <nwc10> timotimo: but this is version 2 format I'm trying to use. The default.

[11:23] <nwc10> timotimo: OK. using nqp-ops-make-stuff-faster from https://github.com/timo/p6-app-moarvm-heapanalyzer

[11:24] <nwc10> I think you're missing Compress::Zstd and Concurrent::Progress from the dependencies

[11:24] <nwc10> *think*, bceause I may not have given zef the correct arguments to find the correct dependency metadata to check on

[11:24] <nwc10> and, I can't get it to read heap dumps frmo MoarVM master, or that branch partial-heap-profiler-fix (1 more commit)

[11:25] <nwc10> ie heap dump files starting "MoarHeapDumpv002"

[16:49] <MasterDuke> nwc10: huh. i just got a heap snapshot to show in moarperf with the nqp-ops-make-stuff-faster branch of https://github.com/timo/p6-app-moarvm-heapanalyzer

[16:57] <timotimo> you have to configure moar to not use the zstd-based format
