[10:43] <brrt> btw, anybody planning to go to FOSDEM this year?

[10:43] *** sena_kun left
[10:47] <nwc10> No. But I am planning to go to http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2020/

[10:56] <brrt> hmm

[10:56] <brrt> interesting

[10:56] <brrt> mildly inconvenient but interesting

[10:56] <jnthn> I'll get at gpw2020 also, fwiw

[10:58] *** sena_kun joined
[11:13] <nine> brrt: I am

[11:14] <nine> planning on both

[11:27] <brrt> I wonder if it'd be reasonable to try and drive to Brussels...

[11:27] <brrt> it's much closer than I imagined from the train distance

[11:28] <nwc10> yes, but, is it reasonable to drive *back* from Brussels

[11:28] <brrt> hehe, there is belgian traffic to account for as well

[11:29] <nwc10> Belgian beer good, Belgian traffic bad?

[11:30] <brrt> from the PoV of the Netherlands, I'd say that's accurate

[11:30] <brrt> and driving is a strict choice for the one in favor of the other

[11:30] <nwc10> that was why I was suggesting that the "drive from" was a more important question than the "drive to" :-)

[11:31] <brrt> the thing is, if/when I've taken the train, it's been... suboptimal

[11:31] <brrt> wait for the bus, no obvious way to pay for a ticket

[11:32] <brrt> wait for the shuttle bus back

[11:32] <brrt> miss the train

[11:32] <nwc10> convince someone else that they like driving more than they like beer?

[11:33] <brrt> :-D

[14:26] <rypervenche> I noticed that MoarVM 2020.01.1 is not considered the "Latest release" on the github releases page. Is that intentional because there isn't yet a rakudo release?

[14:27] <sena_kun> rypervenche: as far as I know, 2020.01.1 point release is not yet done

[14:27] <sena_kun> there are indeed preparations for it done

[14:28] <rypervenche> Ahh, so it's just a tag then? I didn't know it would show up under Releases.

[14:28] <sena_kun> awww, there is a tag already?

[14:30] <rypervenche> samcv said "release is done" yesterday.

[14:30] <sena_kun> rypervenche: ok, then it's the different beast. I think the releases page just wasn't updated.

[14:30] <sena_kun> because 2020.01 isn't there too

[14:31] <sena_kun> damn, I've missed that. :S

[14:31] <sena_kun> rypervenche: then rakudo will have a release tonight too. :)

[14:31] <rypervenche> Glad I said something :)

[14:32] <sena_kun> yup, thank you very much. :)

[17:00] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/bd9661f276f685a3860d468b9900c741 - counts of vmarray sizes, usages, and slot types at the end of  perl6 -e 'use nqp; nqp::force_gc()'

[17:02] <timotimo> one potential optimization is in-situ storage, i.e. instead of a pointer to an allocated blob we store the values there

[17:05] <timotimo> important to not make the regular use case of "make array a given size, then resize it back to 0" any worse

[17:33] *** zakharyas left
[18:06] *** domidumont joined
[18:08] <japhb> timotimo: Why are there thousands of "sz 0 use 0"?  Why do those arrays even still exist at that point?

[18:09] <lizmat> grammar stuff ?

[18:09] <japhb> I'm also intrigued about why "sz 3 use 3" is far and away the most common, followed by 6 and 9.  Wondering what 3-element arrays are being used so much for.

[18:10] <japhb> lizmat: Hmmm, that's an interesting thought (and possible LHF for optimization?)

[18:11] <lizmat> possibly, but I could also see it being an optimization so that you wouldn't have to check for nullness

[18:12] <japhb> lizmat: Right, but you could have all of those point to the *same* vmarray.

[18:12] <lizmat> true
