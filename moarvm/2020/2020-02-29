[12:45] <lizmat> oh noes  :-)  the floe!

[12:45] * lizmat also has a runny nose, but no sore throat

[12:52] <moritz> timotimo: get well soon!

[13:05] <timotimo> i wonder if the current flu would outcompete the covid19 in a human body

[13:07] <lizmat> I think it will just make it harder for the body to cope

[13:08] <lizmat> which may be one of the reasons some of the young early health professionals still died from the virus: massive repeated exposure, rather than a one time limited exposure

[13:08] <timotimo> hoping the german perl/raku workshop will be all right

[13:08] <lizmat> we will see... it's not like there's going to be 1000 people there...

[13:12] <timotimo> was thinking more of "people staying home because sick"

[13:12] <lizmat> again, we will see  :-)

[17:09] <nine> tbrowder: what do you mean by "specific compiler used for a commit"? How is a compiler involved in committing?

[17:32] <nine> I can't think of a situation where knowing that would help me.

[17:32] <nine> It would probably explain why someone missed a warning or compilation issue, but not what to do about it.

[17:36] <patrickb> I'd like to get https://github.com/MoarVM/dyncall/pull/9 merged. That's a bump to the latest upstream commit. The only changes to what we currently have are two fixes, one for building on PPC64 and one for our musl build problem (and some changelog entries). Whoever has permissions is invited to merge.

[17:41] <lizmat> patrickb: looks like we lost Geth again, but it has been merged now

[17:41] <patrickb> lizmat: Thanks! PR to get this into MoarVM is coming soon.

[18:54] *** zakharyas joined
[19:49] *** hankache joined
[19:56] <nine> tbrowder: ok, but how would that help us?

[20:14] <tbrowder> well, it might explain why i'm seeing some warnings with my compiler, gcc x.y, when the comitter used ibm x.y, or clang x.y on mac

[20:16] <tbrowder> i mean i would generally compile with no warnings before comitting to a c repo

[20:17] <tbrowder> of course i understand some may have a different opinion about that

[20:17] <tbrowder> and i probably have done it, too

[20:23] <nine> tbrowder: and what would you do with this knowledge?

[20:24] <tbrowder> first see if i couldd

[20:26] <tbrowder> try that compiler to see the results. if there were still warnings, i would consider spending some time to eliminate them and submit a PR.

[20:27] <nine> Why not cut that short and go straight into trying to eliminate them? I don't see what knowing that some other compiler does or doesn't show those warnings will buy you.

[20:28] <tbrowder> probably nothing, but i'm trying to be a team player

[20:29] <tbrowder> and if there were a difference it seems like it should be worth a release note

[20:41] *** leont joined
[20:41] <nine> Well instead of documenting which compilers we use and what warnings they throw, I'd rather like to see us fix those warnings.

[20:46] <tbrowder> roger!

[21:07] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[21:07] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Moving the affected variables out of the scope of the setjmp instruction avoids

[21:07] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: potential clobbering. They are only used for nested interpreters anyway, so

[21:07] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: they may as well live in MVM_interp_run_nested. The important part is that we

[21:07] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: don't NULL them in MVM_interp_run.

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: when it's actually initialized. When derived_only is true, then by_type[0].type

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: will be NULL, so we won't enter the if (by_type[i].type != NULL) branch,

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: as additionally by_type will only have a single element, so i will be 0.

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Later on we will initialize first_added instead of comparing to it.
