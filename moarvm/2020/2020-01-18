[11:17] <MasterDuke> how about saturday brunch time, anybody up for some git submoduling?

[11:30] * nine has never done anything with submodules

[12:40] <MasterDuke> gonna be afk for a while, but i'll leave an explanation of what i'm trying to do

[12:40] <MasterDuke> in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1221 i've switched our libtommath submodule to the upstream v1.2.0 tag

[12:41] <MasterDuke> (and added a bunch of commits to moarvm)

[12:42] *** sena_kun left
[12:43] <MasterDuke> however, to build with clang or msvc and no optimization like our CI environments do (Travis clang jobs and Appveyor), i had to add a commit on top of the v1.2.0 tag

[12:46] <MasterDuke> now tags are immutable, so i'm not sure how/where to then push that commit or how to have our submodule reference it

[12:48] <MasterDuke> i did make a commit in 3rdparty/libtommath, but when i tried to push it git complained i wasn't on a branch, so i then did `git push origin v1.2.0`, which succeeded, but i don't know what it actually did

[12:49] <MasterDuke> the commit id i have locally can't be browsed to in https://github.com/MoarVM/libtommath

[12:51] <MasterDuke> if i `git checkout <that_id>` in 3rdparty/libtommath, a `git status` back in the moarvm root says `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/use_libtommath_v1.2.0_for_real_maybe' by 1 commit.  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)`

[12:52] <MasterDuke> however, if i push, it errors with `fatal: src refspec 'refs/heads/use_libtommath_v1.2.0_for_real_maybe' must name a reffatal: process for submodule '3rdparty/libtommath' failed`

[12:52] <MasterDuke> i've googled around a bit, but haven't found anything that's fixed it for me

[12:57] <MasterDuke> hm, maybe i should create a branch in our submodule from the v1.2.0 tag (e.g., something like `git checkout -b v1.2.0_plus_changes_for_building_without_optimization`) which just has my one extra commit and try to point to that?

[13:13] <timotimo> MasterDuke:i can try to help

[13:13] <timotimo> is v1.2.0_for_real_maybe a tag? is use_libtommath_v1.2.0_for_real_maybe a moarvm branch or a "our own 3rdparty repository" tag or branch?

[13:48] *** MasterDukeMobile joined
[13:49] <MasterDukeMobile> timotimo: not at my computer and on a poor connection

[13:49] <MasterDukeMobile> But that’s a MoarVM branch

[13:57] *** MasterDukeMobile left
[14:07] <timotimo> OK

[14:08] *** Ven`` joined
[14:08] <timotimo> if we want libtommath version 1.2.0 + a custom commit or two to be available, we'll have to create that as a branch or tag and push it to github, then we'd change the URL of the submodule to point at our fork, then we can push a version of moarvm's repo that has our stuff checked out

[14:10] *** MasterDukeMobile joined
[14:11] <MasterDukeMobile> The submodule does already point to our fork I think

[14:15] <MasterDukeMobile> I think I set a new remote to point upstream and pulled the v1.2.0 tag and set my branch to it

[14:15] <MasterDukeMobile> But maybe I haven’t yet pushed those commits to our fork

[14:16] <MasterDukeMobile> So maybe I should do that, then creating a branch in our fork with my extra commit seems like it might work

[16:25] <MasterDuke> ah ha!

[16:25] <MasterDuke> now it builds!

[16:25] <MasterDuke> ci shows fails because of the 2 bad nqp expmod tests, but once we resolve how those should be handled we're good to go with libtommath v1.2.0
