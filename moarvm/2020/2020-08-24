[07:16] <MasterDuke> ahoy

[07:17] <MasterDuke> timotimo: moarperf is giving me an 'oh no.' when i click on 'Explore Call Graph', but i'm not seeing anything in the console output

[07:20] <MasterDuke> correction, it's only when i click on thread 0

[07:20] <MasterDuke> *1

[07:33] <timotimo> MasterDuke: does the problem also happen after you've opened the routine list?

[07:37] <MasterDuke> yep

[07:38] <MasterDuke> same happens when i click the arrow next to a routine

[08:27] <timotimo> that second file looks like it's just from extensions

[08:27] *** leont joined
[08:28] <MasterDuke> i don't know web dev. i'm just pasting random stuff i see when i open FF's dev tools

[08:54] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i just noticed the details for callers and callees in the routines section are a little different

[08:55] <MasterDuke> callees is 'Entries	Inlined	Time', but callers is just 'Inlined	Entries'
