[00:12] <Voldenet> sena_kun: I doubt it's a good solution though ‚Äì musl implements dl_iterate_phdr, but I've had no idea how to detect that it's available and the resulting solution is low-effort fix that makes tests moderately happy

[18:10] <samcv> Altai-man_, what OS do you have?

[18:10] <Altai-man_> samcv, gnu/linux box, is it a problem?

[18:11] <Altai-man_> or, what the requirement is?

[18:11] <samcv> well. not really. though i'm curious if you checkout 2020.02 and run make release=2020.02; and then tell me the md5sum of the output

[18:12] <Altai-man_> samcv, latest?

[18:12] <samcv> no, checkout 2020.02 tag

[18:12] <Altai-man_> oh, 2020.02, sorry

[18:12] <samcv> this isn't a requirement (reproducable builds) but I think it would be pretty neat to do

[18:12] <Altai-man_> samcv, md5 of the whole output?

[18:13] <samcv> uh. no the resulting file

[18:13] <Altai-man_> oki

[18:13] <samcv> oh wait. uh.

[18:14] <samcv> nevermind. let's do the latest. i forgot my changes are not going to be in 2020.02 :D

[18:14] <Altai-man_> well, yes. :)

[18:15] <samcv> so: make release VERSION=2020.02 && md5sum MoarVM-2020.02.tar.gz

[18:16] <Altai-man_> it dies for me with `bash -c 'if [[ $(git status --untracked=no --porcelain) ]]; then echo "Dirty work trees will make broken releases; maybe git stash?"; exit 1; fi'` because `MANIFEST` file is created, but it is created by `make release VERSION=2020.02`

[18:16] <Altai-man_> I wonder what I am doing wrong

[18:18] <samcv> does "git status" show anything?

[18:18] <Altai-man_> only MANIFEST file in root. if I'll remove that, on a first run of make release it is created and detected as unclean state?

[18:19] <Altai-man_> maybe I should just run tools.release.sh?

[18:19] <Altai-man_> s!tools.release!tools/release!

[18:19] <Altai-man_> samcv, 9def3e4c486c90698c069eb0884db6e7  MoarVM-2020.02.tar.gz

[18:27] <samcv> Altai-man_, can you try this:

[18:27] <samcv> git clone [email@hidden.address] && cd /tmp/MoarVM && perl Configure.pl && make release VERSION=2020.02 && md5sum MoarVM-2020.02.tar.gz

[18:27] <samcv> err wait

[18:27] <samcv> yeah. do that. in /tmp or something so we can make sure it's the same exactly

[18:27] <samcv> cd /tmp && git clone [email@hidden.address] && cd /tmp/MoarVM && perl Configure.pl && make release VERSION=2020.02 && md5sum MoarVM-2020.02.tar.gz

[18:28] <samcv> I get 6d04e9404919e597a1f32ff0d320e3e1

[18:33] <Altai-man_> let's see

[18:37] <Altai-man_> samcv, totally different for me. :(

[18:38] <samcv> if you do 'make release VERSION=2020.02' again, is the md5sum the same?

[18:38] <Altai-man_> 9def3e4c486c90698c069eb0884db6e7, I can upload my build to investigate what's different

[18:39] <Altai-man_> m: say '9def3e4c486c90698c069eb0884db6e7' eq '9def3e4c486c90698c069eb0884db6e7'

[18:39] <evalable6> Altai-man_, rakudo-moar 551c157fa: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[18:39] <Altai-man_> samcv, ^

[18:39] <samcv> Altai-man_, what is your 'tar --version' and 'gzip --version'?

[18:39] <Altai-man_> tar (GNU tar) 1.32, gzip 1.10

[18:41] <samcv> Altai-man_, yeah, can you upload it somewhere?

[18:43] <Altai-man_> samcv, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tJR-jrQSHKzPBFy_G-qgAHePWpJwv5m_/view?usp=sharing
