[20:24] <lizmat> figured we want to give this as much testing as possible

[20:56] <jnthn> +1

[21:00] <lizmat> will bump in a mo

[21:35] <timotimo> jnthn:did you read a bit of what i wrote about nqp::list_b, aka "the thing that gives us a few kilobytes of 'getcode' + 'push_o' in CORE.c.setting's <unit>"?

[21:36] <timotimo> i considered both a "pushcode" or a "getcodesfrom" that takes an integer array with frame indices as a wval

[21:36] <timotimo> well, doesn't have to be a wval, but it most likely would be

[21:46] * lizmat wonders what nqp::list_b is

[21:46] <timotimo> it's a desugar

[21:48] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTCompilerMAST.nqp#L878 - the only usage at first glance

[21:48] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp#L589-L613 - the impl

[21:49] <lizmat> ah, so an nqp::list of blocks

[21:49] <timotimo> well, the code objects belonging to the blocks

[22:52] <jnthn> timotimo: We may also be able to store that mapping table in some other way rather than do it as instructions.

[22:52] <jnthn> Which'd be a bit more work to implement, but likely faster

[22:52] <jnthn> Since there's nothing to interpret
