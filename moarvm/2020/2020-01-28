[18:31] <japhb> Kaiepi: Would you be willing to work on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1229 since you're doing networking stuff right now?

[18:32] <japhb> This stands between me and networked twitch games in Raku, so you know, super high priority of course.  ;-)

[18:32] * sena_kun encourages for active grant-related merging next weeks

[18:32] <Kaiepi> socket options are something i'm planning on implementing once udp socket support for IO::Socket::INET exists

[18:32] <japhb> (y)

[18:33] <japhb> Thank you ++Kaiepi!

[18:34] <japhb> (FWIW, in this case I'm talking about a *TCP* option, but I'm guessing you just meant "this is the order I'm doing work in")

[18:37] <Kaiepi> yeah
