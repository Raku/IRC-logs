[07:57] <MasterDuke> partial success implementing pointer to current candidates and current guard tree last night. i traded a segv during the nqp build for an earlier segv during the nqp build

[07:57] <MasterDuke> it just all depends on how one defines success...

[08:00] <nwc10> "it compiles - ship it!" is not good enough round here? :-)

[08:57] <timotimo> it compiles ... but at what cost ...

[12:03] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1412

[12:04] <nwc10> oooh, that's going to break nicely

[12:07] <nwc10> I should have tested that branch *before* the PR

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: Add a probe for pow() corner cases with Inf and NaN.

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: 

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: Solaris doesn't default to being POSIX conformat, but NQP and the spectests

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: assume that we are. It's not clear *how* to flip the defaults with gcc, so

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: code around the problem.

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: 

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: Disable JITting `pow_n` if the C library pow() isn't conformant.

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: (I don't have x86 Solaris to test, but given how thorough Sun's engineering

[12:12] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: was, I assume that it's C library behaves identically to Sparc's, so likely

[12:13] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: it would JIT to the LTA implementation.)

[12:13] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/solaris: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5e031c9175

[12:17] <nwc10> that stands a fighting chance of working on non-LTA platforms

[17:02] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/a2f24b384dbef490295b661e8d54455f i'm not sure if i'm missing something like a memory barrier or just haven't implemented this correctly? but i still get segvs very early in nqp build

[20:27] <nwc10> OK, welcome to crazy.

[20:27] <nwc10> On Solaris, if you use /bin/sh to start a new process, it *will* update the environment variable PWD to the current directory

[20:27] <nwc10> oh, unless the current directory is /tmp

[20:27] <nwc10> (or I think, subdirectories of it)

[20:36] <nwc10> no, seemingly it's set if cwd happens to be ~ or /

[20:36] <nwc10> otherwise it's unchanged

[20:36] <leont> How wonderful

[20:36] <nwc10> indeed

[20:36] <nwc10> at least now after an hour of fiddlign with truss

[20:37] <nwc10> I've figured out that my test C code was the problem

[20:37] <nwc10> I need to exactly replicate the directory of the problem Rakudo spectest

[20:37] <nwc10> well, most accurately it seems

[20:37] <nwc10> either /

[20:37] <nwc10> or a path that resolves to be the same as $HOME

[20:38] <nwc10> because it's canonicalised to /export/home/nick

[21:41] <patrickb> I'd value some eyes on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1408 (and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4138 for that matter).

[21:41] <tellable6> 2020-12-24T00:15:10Z #raku <tony-o> patrickb i'll merge winpass and that should get rid of the gcc requirement

[21:41] <tellable6> 2020-12-24T22:14:53Z #raku-dev <ugexe> patrickb: there are cpan examples in the Appveyor file 

[21:41] <tellable6> 2020-12-28T19:00:09Z #raku <tony-o> patrickb can we remove the config stuff from the password branch and put that in a separate issue?

[21:43] <patrickb> I love to be able to merge those PRs a good time away from the next release.
