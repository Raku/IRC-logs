[18:04] * lizmat is unsure as to what would be needed to bump libuv

[18:17] <nwc10> bigger hammer? :-)

[18:18] <nwc10> (our office has a new noisy neighbour - a piledriver that I guess is 12m tall)

[18:27] <lizmat> that too should pass  :-)

[18:35] <jnthn> releasable6: status

[20:09] <AlexDaniel> what an interesting update

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> smooth mosaic terminal graphic characters, fills, stick figures, segmented digits

[20:14] <AlexDaniel> ‚ÄúSymbols for Legacy Computing‚Äù pretty sure everyone will use those for modern purposes :)

[20:20] <lizmat> well... /me is fond of the good old teletext

[20:21] <lizmat> https://nos.nl/teletekst

[20:23] <lizmat> it's still a thing in NL, and a major source of up-to-date news without any advertising

[20:24] <lizmat> the limited size of each page, ensures a concise news report
