[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix memory leak in resolve_param_interns

[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Forgot to free() the array with which we track, which parametrics we already

[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: resolved. As this runs once per module load and the array will usually be quite

[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: small, the leak is not large, but a leak is a leak...

[07:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8c41f6692e

[07:01] <nine> You know you have spent too much time with a piece of code, when you discover such leaks when sitting on the toilet without any electronics nearby...

[07:07] *** sena_kun joined
[07:44] <nwc10> :-) or is that :-( ?

[08:16] <nine> a bit of both maybe? :D

[08:17] <nine> Nah, mostly positive... gives me confidence that I will be able to fix the remaining issues

[16:16] <nine> Ha! Looks like we can actually be too successful in finding existing parametrizations, i.e. if they are from the comp unit we're currently loading. In that case they may hide the ones we're actually trying to merge with

[16:35] <nwc10> and down to your last few coffee beans?

[16:38] <timotimo> do we have anything to disable hash randomization? nwc10?

[16:38] <nwc10> #define MVM_HASH_RANDOMIZE 1

[16:38] <nwc10> in src/moar.h

[16:38] <timotimo> ah, i should have given -i to ack

[16:38] <nwc10> set that to 1 to disable it

[16:38] <nine> No way! I stocked up pretty well last week

[16:38] <timotimo> then i would have found it

[16:38] <timotimo> thankses

[16:38] <nwc10> nine: cool

[16:39] <nwc10> timotimo: I forget - where in the code do I need to add (back) the size of the not-GC-allocated part of hashes?

[16:39] <timotimo> it's called unmanaged_size

[16:39] <timotimo> in the repr

[16:39] <nwc10> aha

[16:40] <nwc10> OK thanks. I shall have a look at how other reprs do that
