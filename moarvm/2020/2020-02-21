[07:33] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[07:33] <nwc10> is it possible to take a heap snapshot of a long running program?

[07:33] <nwc10> I can cope with an answer of Yes, even if Yes is "hook gdb up to the running process and then use it to call this C function"

[07:33] *** Altai-man_ joined
[07:34] <nwc10> I can't find this in the docs.

[07:36] *** sena_kun left
[07:37] <nine> nwc10: I think you'd need to run it with --profile-kind=heap from the start

[07:38] <nwc10> I'd rather not do that - at least not to the production code, as it needs to keep runnig

[07:38] <nine> I know the feeling :)

[07:39] <nwc10> it's run out of systemd, and it does stuff the entire office notices

[07:39] <nwc10> oh, and also people would ask why I wasn't working on $other, which the ticketing system thinks that I'm working on

[09:05] <Altai-man_> We are all set to do a MoarVM release. It would be truly awesome to do it either today or tomorrow (I'll prepare release branch today and will produce a build ASAP as MoarVM release will be available).

[10:48] <jnthn> nwc10: I thought that Telemetry could be used to a heap snapshot on demend?

[10:48] <jnthn> timotimo implemented that, I think

[10:49] <nwc10> jnthn: from my reading of the code, it looked like it

[10:49] <nwc10> and lizmat answered usefully on #rako

[10:49] <nwc10> but distracted by "real" $ork

[10:50] <nwc10> or, at least, the thing the ticketing system thinks that I'm working on

[10:50] <nwc10> (and something else it also doesn't need to know about)

[11:01] <lizmat> aaah... yes... now I remember...  :-)

[11:01] <lizmat> timotimo sneaked that in...  :-)

[11:01] <lizmat> now *that* indeed lacks documentation

[11:07] <nine> preparing ChangeLog

[12:11] <Guest1277> releasable: next

[12:11] <releasable6> Guest1277, Next release in ≈1 day and ≈6 hours. There are no known blockers. 163 out of 250 commits logged

[12:11] <releasable6> Guest1277, Details: https://gist.github.com/ef518eaeb5fb4197469b5c2a327a4186

[12:11] <Guest1277> no blockers, hmm

[12:13] <Altai-man_> Guest1277, hmm?

[12:14] <Altai-man_> Guest1277, the blockers were resolved and we're releasing on schedule, is there any news preventing it?

[12:17] <Guest1277> Altai-man_: no :) but new blockers have a tendency to show up when you least expect them

[12:49] <timotimo> i've been meaning to make debugserver able to take a heap snapshot

[12:49] <timotimo> then you won't have to change the code

[12:50] <jnthn> +1

[12:51] <timotimo> it'll most likely just write to a local file rather than transmit it over the socket, though

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 926349cde6 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | tools/release

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Add logging commits to ChangeLog and bumping VERSION to tools/release

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Rewrote the script in raku to make it more maintainable and extensible.

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: It now understands the --/update-changelog --/update-version and

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: --/check-git-status options.

[13:37] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: It also now uses the machine's CPU count as default for make jobs and

[13:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: TEST_JOBS.

[13:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/926349cde6

[13:38] <nine> Obvious next step is to open the ChangeLog in $EDITOR after adding the commits (so the user can clean up/consolidate the list) and commit those changes before bumping the VERSION

[13:39] <nine> Steps 6 and 7 of the release guide will be quite trivial as well

[15:50] <nine> Guest1277: yes?

[15:58] <Guest1277> nine: did you manage to get jit related errors when running spectest? If so, which test was it?

[15:59] <Guest1277> I can get plenty bu only if MoarVM is compiled without optimizations

[15:59] <Guest1277> *but

[16:05] <nine> Those assertions will only trigger in a debug build as they are not compiled in otherwise
