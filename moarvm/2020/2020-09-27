[06:57] <nine> MasterDuke: patching gmp to fix issues means that we can't use an already installed gmp

[07:49] <MasterDuke> nine: true. we have patches on a couple of our 3rdparty libraries, some of them are for building, which obviously doesn't matter for --has-foo, but i don't think they all are. we don't test --has-* in CI do we?

[07:51] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[07:53] <MasterDuke> i think i'm going to go with just '*' today

[07:53] <nwc10> OK. I hope that tomorrow is better

[07:54] <MasterDuke> likewise, fighting a cold for the past week. they usually only last a day or two

[07:57] <MasterDuke> ok, all nqp tests pass (quick hack of ucing the string if the base is > 10)

[08:02] <MasterDuke> down to two failed tests in rakudo's tests and 20 files with fails in a spectest

[08:02] <MasterDuke> huh. two TODOs passed in t/spec/S02-types/int-uint.rakudo.moar

[13:08] <MasterDuke> ugh. i'm not sure i can fix any of the other problems until i figure out why some bigints are going to zero. e.g., `say +(42 xx 2**99)` gives 0, no idea why

[13:34] <lizmat> xx ?

[13:35] <lizmat> aren't we limited to 64bIt wrt to lengths of nqp::lists ?

[13:35] <lizmat> shouldn't that just horribly die?   or is that your point ?

[13:48] <MasterDuke> m: say +(42 xx 2**99)

[13:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «Cannot .elems a lazy list␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:48] <MasterDuke> yeah, returning 0 is just all kinds of wrong

[13:49] <MasterDuke> the 2**99 is being calculated correctly, but then it's actually getting into elems of src/6model/reprs/VMArray.c and body->elems is 0 (that part isn't really surprising)

[13:50] <MasterDuke> i just haven't figured out what's going wrong in the middle

[13:54] <MasterDuke> m: say so 42 xx 2⁹⁹⁹⁹⁹ # though is this really correct?

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[13:55] <MasterDuke> i guess cause it's a sequence it's ok

[15:19] <dogbert17> if the MVM_SPESH_CHECK_PRESELECTION is set here, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/frame.c#L7, and it triggers a warning

[15:20] <dogbert17> when running e.g. t/spec/S06-operator-overloading/circumfix.t is that a bug or something which can be safely ignored?

[15:42] <MasterDuke> the current diff if anybody wants to look https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/d55b72545e01b060736f718012a26bd4

[15:46] <tobs> MasterDuke: that comment seems outdated now? https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/d55b72545e01b060736f718012a26bd4#file-gmp-patch-L185

[15:54] <MasterDuke> tobs: ha, right. though i hope that code will change again

[16:00] <MasterDuke> if that is the way we end up dealing with gmp returning lowercase values then it'd probably be faster to just uppercase the c str directly, instead of doing it to the MVMString
