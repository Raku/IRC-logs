[06:29] <samcv> are we moving everything to azure?

[08:46] <lizmat> samcv: I believe that's the plan for CI, yes

[08:53] *** sena_kun joined
[09:12] *** patrickb joined
[09:13] <patrickb> o/

[09:13] <nwc10> \o

[09:13] <patrickb> samcv: The plan is to only have AzureCI.

[09:16] <nwc10> I assume that this is because "it's better", but if you said more, I forgot the "why"

[09:17] <patrickb> I think Azure does everything we need. So once Azure is in shape and our setup does the same things the others do we can shut down travis, appveyor and circleci.

[09:18] <nwc10> aha. in that, none of those three provide everything we need? (clearly, if I have this right, not even any two of them offer enough)

[09:18] <patrickb> nwc10: Better in this case means: Win/Mac/Linux support, No monthly usage limits.

[09:18] <patrickb> none of the others did sadly.

[09:19] <patrickb> I actually tried CircleCI first but then hit a bug in their billing that prevented us from actually doing any Windows builds.

[09:19] <nwc10> OK, good :-) I was going to guess that it was something about (also) having Mac and also Win32

[09:19] <nwc10> forgotten about usage limits

[09:19] <patrickb> Travis is bad with Windows, AppVeyor is bad with non-Windows.

[09:19] <patrickb> All the others have some form of monthly rate limits.

[09:20] <nwc10> Microsoft has deep pockets and wants everyone to be friends with them, so is throwing CPU at the problem? (also, if one *owns* the cloud service, it's less cost. Or even "a different business model")

[09:20] <nwc10> much like (effectively) they are sponsoring github as a loss-leader, for other things they do want to sell to folks.

[09:20] <patrickb> nwc10: Might be so. But the why doesn't really matter as long as we can assume it stays that way.

[09:21] <nwc10> I'm not too worried about the "why" on this, as long as it stays that way for "long enough"

[09:21] <patrickb> I have to leave again. o/

[09:21] <nwc10> but the sale of github was an eye-opener. In one sense, github had the entire open source world hostage (or at least, a hostage to fortune) and it's lucky that they didn't go bust, or get bought by a (subtly) unfriendly firm

[09:22] <nwc10> have fun \o
