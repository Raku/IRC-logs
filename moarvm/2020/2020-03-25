[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Make OSR work in frames from invokewithcapture

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We didn't know how to locate the appropriate callsite and argument

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: capture in order to evaluate the argument guard and thus find the

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: appropriate spesh candidate to do OSR with. We are careful to try and

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: avoid any false positives in the results by checking the callsite and

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: arg guard of the currently running frame really match; this is cheaper

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: and safer than trying to arrange to clear out the argument capture

[12:22] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: reference in the frame extras in a timely manner.

[12:32] <lizmat> jnthn: time to bump and get a blin run ?

[12:34] <jnthn> can do

[12:34] <jnthn> Though probably I patch at least one more thing today

[12:34] <jnthn> lunch &

[12:38] <lizmat> ok, I'll wait then

[12:39] <lizmat> or maybe, for bisectability, do it now

[12:43] <MasterDuke> do you think that fix will have much wider impact than that example?

[13:29] <jnthn> Anything with its hot loop depending on OSR in a multi, I guess

[13:30] <jnthn> Well, and on the first call to that multi being long-lasting
