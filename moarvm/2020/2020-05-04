[18:35] *** pilmihilmi joined
[18:37] <pilmihilmi> I try to get https://github.com/tokuhirom/Perl6-Renshu/blob/master/nqp-lisp/lisp.nqp running and wonder why 'make QAST::NVal.new(:value(+$/.Str));' always fails...

[18:38] <pilmihilmi> '+$/.Str' seems to convert to int instead of num...

[18:38] <pilmihilmi> Expected native num argument, but got int

[18:38] <pilmihilmi>    at gen/moar/stage2/QASTNode.nqp:414  (/usr/share/nqp/lib/QASTNode.moarvm:new

[18:39] <MasterDuke> pilmihilmi: yes, '+' is converted to nqp::intify. nqp defaults all numerical operations to integer semantics, if you want num you have to be explicit about it

[18:40] <MasterDuke> trying using nqp::numify($/.Str) instead

[18:41] <MasterDuke> ah, i see that's an old repo. nqp used to default to num, but was changed (by myself actually) to default to int a year or two ago

[18:46] <pilmihilmi> that makes it compile furthen, thank. 

[18:46] <MasterDuke> np

[18:47] <pilmihilmi> the other repo that has a nice tutorial is https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course, and it uses that +$/.STR too...

[18:52] <MasterDuke> yeah, that should probably be updated, thanks for pointing it out

[18:52] <pilmihilmi> One more question: expressions seems to be parsed not but the TOP rules print an error: "Unable to parse expression in TOP; couldn't find final $  at line 2, near "..."

[18:53] <pilmihilmi> Is this maybe something that is easy to spot also ? 

[18:54] <pilmihilmi> I compile to moarvm through https://github.com/tokuhirom/Perl6-Renshu/blob/master/nqp-lisp/Makefile and then start https://github.com/tokuhirom/Perl6-Renshu/blob/master/nqp-lisp/bin/lisp

[18:55] <pilmihilmi> i get the error when i run bin/lisp -e '(+ 1 1)'

[18:55] <pilmihilmi> (I'm new to nqp...)

[18:56] <pilmihilmi> bin/lisp  -e '(print "a")' 

[18:56] *** Altai-man_ joined
[18:57] <pilmihilmi> on the other hand works fine.

[18:59] <[Coke]> out of curiosity, does (print (+ 1 1)) work?

[18:59] *** sena_kun left
[18:59] <[Coke]> wondering if the math op isn't fully defined as a statement somehow.

[19:00] <pilmihilmi> sorry... I had changed the "token num" rule while fiddeling around.... it works again...

[19:00] <pilmihilmi> bin/lisp  -e '(+ 1 1)'

[19:01] <pilmihilmi> works again..

[19:02] <[Coke]> +1

[19:04] <pilmihilmi> https://github.com/tokuhirom/Perl6-Renshu/pull/1/commits

[19:04] <pilmihilmi> fixed, thanks.

[20:05] <timotimo> "+ [9294cbfcf] Use memcpy instead of strncpy" should this really be put as a change? with no context like that it sounds like we changed all strncpy to memcpy or something

[20:06] <timotimo> i'd probably put it under the next line, "fix some compler warnings"

[20:06] <sena_kun> timotimo, we have lines like these in numerous releases and nobody bats an eye, so I thought it was ok.

[20:06] <sena_kun> s/these/this/

[20:07] <sena_kun> >+ [807b92f9] Use strndup instead of malloc+strncpy

[20:07] <sena_kun> from 2019.07

[20:08] <sena_kun> >+ [0814ab4d8] Negative numbers should not be prime

[20:08] <sena_kun> from 2020.02 release can be re-phrased.

[20:09] <sena_kun> I can agree it can be better next time. ;)

[20:12] <timotimo> mhm

[20:12] <timotimo> it's not that important, really

[20:15] *** pamplemousse joined
[20:17] <timotimo> the changelog looks all right, but i didn't check the git log to see if anything is missing

[20:17] <timotimo> but the bot does that, right?

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> not for moarvm

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> but there's a script I think

[20:19] <sena_kun> I did not mention merges

[20:19] <timotimo> but the changes that were in the branches that were merged?

[20:19] <sena_kun> Also some "oops, do it again, oops, re-do" ones.

[20:19] <sena_kun> timotimo, checked those.

[20:20] <timotimo> perfect :)

[20:21] <sena_kun> timotimo, to check the changelog is correct one needs to recreate it and given nobody is really eager to do this boring stuff... :P

[20:21] <sena_kun> I would really love to see releasable6-like changelog script for moar as well.

[20:22] <timotimo> that should be easy to do! what, i should do it? no, i don't want to! ;)

[20:26] <sena_kun> >gpg: signing failed: No such file or directory

[20:26] <sena_kun> why even the most simplest things just don't work today
