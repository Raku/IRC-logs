[09:22] <Altai-man> o/

[09:23] <nwc10> \o

[09:24] <Altai-man> no news about https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/e36b87dd4522f74856ea9eb8c6d43046 ?

[09:35] <nwc10> no, sorry, not from me. Not had the combination of time and headspace

[09:57] <Altai-man> no stress, just curious

[10:21] <jnthn> I wonder if merging https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1384 would resolve it; it's at least in that territory

[10:21] <tellable6> 2020-12-08T16:07:19Z #moarvm <vrurg> jnthn would it be possible for you to have a look at my comment at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4096#issuecomment-740713808 ?

[10:23] <nwc10> I certainly wouldn't object to soemone else giving that PR a once over (or an "eyes glaze over") but my initial assumption was that

[10:23] <nwc10> because that PR fixes a problem that is consistent on *all* 32 bit platforms that I could access

[10:23] <nwc10> and that gist is for something that passes everywhere "else"

[10:23] <nwc10> then it can't be the same problem

[10:24] <nwc10> of course, I didn't test this :-)
