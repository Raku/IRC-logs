[12:24] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: any reason why M#1232 is not merged?

[12:24] <linkable6> M#1232 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1232 Revert to treating all addresses like those meant for passive sockets

[12:27] <Kaiepi> offhand, no, that should've been merged a while ago

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: what about M#1199 ?

[12:31] <linkable6> M#1199 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1199 Fix builds on OpenBSD

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: looks like jnthn's comments were taken into account

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> everything else makes sense to me

[12:38] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: and what's the status of M#1137 ? Should I ping somebody about it?

[12:38] <linkable6> M#1137 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1137 Implement NativeCall wide string support

[12:44] <Kaiepi> hmm

[12:45] <Kaiepi> it needs to be updated pretty badly at this point AlexDaniel, but it's not something i've totally abandoned since it'd be nice to have editline support in the repl

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: you mean M#1137? But what about M#1199?

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> timotimo, MasterDuke: half of MoarVM PRs on the last page are yours, can you take a look and close anything that's not relevant anymore? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc

[12:51] <Kaiepi> part of #1199's a duplicate of a fix i made recently, but the compiler warning fixes would be nice to have

[12:51] <Kaiepi> i'll clean it up

[12:51] <timotimo> d'oh

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: ping me when it's ready

[13:12] <Kaiepi> AlexDaniel, the only clang warnings around nowadays are some printf warnings in the profiler, but those are now fixed up in that pr

[13:53] <nine> AlexDaniel++ # working through those PRs

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> nine: what's the status of https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1151 ?

[14:48] <MasterDuke> i'll look at 632 and 660 again. 689 and 773 i'd want to make sure the changes are actually desired 

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: also https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1791 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1873 if possible

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> seems to be about the same change? I'm not sure

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> nine: ah, so it was rebased and github didn't pick it up? :)

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> maybe we can somehow detect if there's any other PR like this
