[08:12] <pilmihilmi> Is it possible to run and debug nqp code in Comma ide? 

[08:25] *** sena_kun joined
[08:28] <pilmihilmi> Or is there a equivalent to perl6-debug-m for nqp ?

[08:32] <nwc10> pilmihilmi: good question, but I'm sorry I really don't know the answer. I don't know who does who is awake. I assume that jnthn does, but he's asleep or possibly just deliberately "Away From Keyboard" until Monday.

[08:45] <sena_kun> pilmihilmi, no nqp debugging in Comma, alas.

[09:57] <pilmihilmi> Comma supporting nqp would be nice. I guess that npq use the same debug interface as raku does.
