[07:28] <tellable6> 2020-07-16T09:09:08Z #moarvm <nwc10> brrt, also these folks seem to have 8Gb Raspberry PIs in stock, and what seems to be a very good price on 32Gb micro SD cards: https://www.welectron.com/Raspberry-Pi-4-Modell-B-8-GB-RAM?utm_campaign=gh

[07:30] <nwc10> oh, and if you F up your order they reply by e-mail and fix it for you. (Or maybe only I can get away with that)

[07:31] <brrt> :-)

[07:31] <brrt> so you really want an arm64 JIT then :-P

[07:31] <nwc10> yes-and-no.

[07:31] <brrt> should b a fun project

[07:31] <nwc10> *I* am still on a 32 bit OS.

[07:32] <nwc10> But I really don't object to you having fun, if you so wish

[07:32] <nwc10> however, if you want to test it on your commute, you're going to need a battery? :-)

[07:33] <nwc10> I also thought about this for about 5 seconds. And so it goes like this

[07:33] <nwc10> "And then I buy you one to say thank you for the x86_64 JIT" and that's like "hey, I bought you one and now you owe me a new JIT".

[07:34] <nwc10> So I think I'll stick to the no-pressure version - you may buy your own. If you want to.

[07:34] <nwc10> I'll stick to beers.

[07:48] <brrt> :-D

[07:48] <brrt> if only I didn't have to do a $job

[07:49] <nwc10> don't they need an arm64 JIT? I mean, think of all the expensive servers they could replace with Rasbperry Pis :-)

[07:51] <nwc10> Wait a moment while I fake up some images of "AWS arm instances" to make this plan seem more plausible.

[07:53] <nwc10> or will this do? https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/07/mythic-800x294.png

[07:53] <nwc10> soruce is https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/website-hosting-on-raspberry-pi-4-with-mythic-beasts/

[07:53] <brrt> oh what happened there

[07:54] <nwc10> caption in the blog post is neeeded to answer that: "The enclosures were built to accommodate a larger PoE HAT, which is why this doesnâ€™t stand up beautifully neatly."

[07:56] <nwc10> AWS seems a bit more hardcore than "just 4 cores" and "just 8Gb": https://aws.amazon.com/tw/blogs/aws/new-m6g-ec2-instances-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton2/ -- The M6g instances are available in 8 sizes with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, and 64 vCPUs, or as bare metal instances. They support configurations with up to 256 GiB of memory, 25 Gbps of network performance, and 19 Gbps of EBS bandwidth. 

[07:57] <brrt> that's... fairly hardcore

[07:57] <nwc10> that what I thought too

[13:00] <nwc10> don't let this worry anyone, but I'm going to have to go shopping. Beer is holding out just fine, but I'm out of coffee.

[13:01] <nwc10> oh pants, it should worry me. If I do it today, I don't need to wear a mask. Rules change tomorrow.

[13:01] <jnthn> Mask reintroduction tomorrow?

[13:01] <nwc10> apparently yes

[13:05] <[Coke]> ... I would recommend wearing the mask today anyway. :|

[13:07] <nwc10> true. good point

[13:08] <nwc10> it's not like it magically suddenly gets worse tomorrow. The odds will alreadhy be getting worse

[19:15] <timotimo> if tomorrow everybody will be wearing masks, you'll have less of a chance to catch something someone else exhaled

[19:15] <timotimo> and of course you could have it yourself without knowing, and breathe it out onto someone else
