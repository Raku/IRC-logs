[08:46] <nwc10> good *

[09:27] <jnthn> morning o/

[09:30] <nwc10> \o

[09:33] <MasterDuke> aloha

[09:37] <brrt> not yet everyone here

[09:37] <brrt> way way way back, when I did something for parrot, we had a parrot weekly meeting

[09:39] <timotimo> did you see my appimages?

[09:41] <jnthn> brrt: Do you think there'd be some value in some kind of scheduled MoarVM team meetups?

[09:42] <jnthn> Raku is getting a steering committee, so maybe it would be a fitting time to do something here too.

[09:43] <nwc10> I don't know what I think about that part

[09:43] <timotimo> having "meeting minutes" in some central place could be good to help me not forget what everybody is/was doing - but also i sometimes just completely forget what i was doing

[09:43] <jnthn> Though I don't think we need anything so "heavyweight"; more just a committers get-together every so often

[09:44] <nwc10> but I will state that I felt that a key useful "innovation" of the parrot meeting ("parrotsketch") was to get people to type up their short reports *in advance* and then just paste them into IRC

[09:44] <nwc10> this avoided delays

[09:44] <jnthn> oh, yes, that's worth stealing :)

[09:44] <nwc10> this is only important if the plan involves reports

[09:44] <nwc10> we failed to do this at work, but our meetings moved off IRC soon enough that I didn't push for it

[09:45] <jnthn> Well, given what timotimo said they'd find useful, maybe it should :) It also, if published somewhere, is good communication that things are happening.

[09:46] <jnthn> Anyway, I'm up for some kind of regular sync-up of what we're all doing, as well as an opportunity to discuss blockers/ideas/whatever.

[09:47] <brrt> jnthn: yeah, I think something like that

[09:47] <brrt> I mean, the #moarvm community, such as it is, is fairly light-touch, that might be a good thing to presever

[09:48] <jnthn> Yes; that's worked well for us, imo.

[09:50] <brrt> but I do agree that a sense of 'what is happening' would be nice, too

[09:52] <jnthn> So maybe we pick an interval, a time, and simply say all those with a commit bit are welcome? Then everyone can pre-submit a "what I've been doing" and perhaps "things I'd like to discuss".

[09:52] <jnthn> And then we see if it's useful and course-correct it as we go.

[09:54] <brrt> ++ from me. (now let's bikeshed about the time)

[09:55] <MasterDuke> in this channel? or using some sort of virtual meeting thing?

[09:55] <jnthn> If we had a dedicated channel for it we can have it logged and that solves minutes? I'm open to other suggestions.

[09:58] <timotimo> that's a good idea

[10:10] <jnthn> OK, so: interval, time :)

[10:12] <nwc10> well, "morning", obviosly

[10:12] <timotimo> let's not forget finding a good pun for the channel name

[10:12] <nwc10> "morning virtual meeting" is a bit long

[10:14] <timotimo> Meeting Of All Relevant Virtual Members

[10:14] <timotimo> not finding a good word for the V

[10:15] <nwc10> that's more a backronym than a pun. Actually, as was mine

[10:17] <jnthn> .oO( moarons )

[12:04] <jnthn> metamoarphic

[12:16] <MasterDuke> i just removed the `rounds` parameter from `nqp::isprime_I` (and the various places in moarvm and ran tools/update_ops.p6) and nqp segfaults in `MVM_cu_string` when calling `nqp::isprime_I`. it's trying to index 3670016 into the string heap, when num_strings is only 255

[12:17] *** ggoebel joined
[12:18] <MasterDuke> this seems like the sort of thing that would have happened if i hadn't run tools/update_ops.p6

[12:41] <MasterDuke> argh! i did update it, but not the offset calculation

[12:41] <MasterDuke> and of course that makes perfect sense

[12:42] <jnthn> :)

[12:43] <MasterDuke> yep, nqp is good now

[12:43] <jnthn> :)

[12:43] <jnthn> I'll return to the spesh candidate thing some time, but I'm not sure I'm feeling any more clever today than I was yesterday...

[12:43] <jnthn> Plus quite keen to get a bit of work in on new-disp, at last...

[12:44] <MasterDuke> i'm all stuffed up and blowing my nose every 2-3min, in no shape for anything complicated either

[12:46] <jnthn> I slept badly on Sunday night. Much better last night, but it seems that doesn't quite make up for it...

[12:46] <MasterDuke> i thought simply removing a parameter from an op would be within reach, but we see where that ended up...
