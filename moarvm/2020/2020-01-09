[00:16] <MasterDuke> also, guess this isn't really a big deal at all, but we create 3 temps, but only ever use two

[00:58] <timotimo> it looks like it's specifically built to use the temp slots, since it takes that idx parameter

[00:59] <timotimo> and it does look like all functions that use force_bigint use it only(?) to provide a bigint into an mp op

[10:30] <scovit> MasterDuke: it feels to me that libtom should provide a macro to reserve an initialized mp_int on the stack, and that would be a saner approach

[10:30] <tellable6> scovit, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[15:01] <tellable6> 2020-01-09T10:30:06Z #moarvm <scovit> MasterDuke: it feels to me that libtom should provide a macro to reserve an initialized mp_int on the stack, and that would be a saner approach

[15:08] <MasterDuke> anybody want to help me debug `This representation (P6num) cannot unbox to other types (for type TestNum)` thrown here https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/t/nqp/060-bigint.t#L137 when using this moarvm branch https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1221 ?

[15:32] <MasterDuke> why doesn't nqp show the right line number in its backtrace? it says the line number of the str() sub, but then immediately after that it just says line 1 of the mainline, not the actual line it gets to

[15:46] *** scovit joined
[15:48] <scovit> Hi MasterDuke, about your message of yesterday, why MoarVM does not allocate thos mp_int on the stack? I've looked at libtommath docs, there is mp_init_set and mp_init_set_int in that library.

[15:49] *** zakharyas1 joined
[15:49] <scovit> Basically it would be a trivial change to force_bigint static function, and you free that array on the global tc

[15:49] <MasterDuke> scovit: good question, i don't know

[15:50] <MasterDuke> my first goal is just to get moarvm/nqp/raku working with libtommath v1.2.0 with the fewest possible changes

[15:50] <scovit> me neither. I do not think it matters in terms of performance particularly

[15:50] <scovit> but code clarity for sure

[15:50] <scovit> Ok :)

[15:52] *** zakharyas left
[15:52] <MasterDuke> but after that there are a bunch of possible cleanups/simplifications. e.g., ltm 1.2 introduces some functions that we had created ourselves, so now wee can switch to theirs

[15:53] <MasterDuke> so i'll keep your idea in mind for that secondary work, thanks

[15:54] <scovit> you are welcome, thank to you to take care of upgrading the library
