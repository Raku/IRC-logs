[15:15] <dogbert11> I have a crappy gist showing a SEGV, perhaps it might tell you something

[18:16] <dogbert11> nine: it was worth a shot, thanks for looking

[18:36] <timotimo> it smells slightly of earlier corruption, but without line numbers it's really hard to tell what's up

[19:44] <dogbert11> yeah, the core dump lacked important information which is unfortunate

[19:56] <nine> I wonder, if there's a possibility to generate the debug symbols after getting such a dump

[19:58] <nine> Or if we could change our build system to always generate the debug symbols but separate them. I get that for free with the rpm packages with moarvm-2020.01.1-57.1.x86_64.rpm and moarvm-debuginfo-2020.01.1-57.1.x86_64.rpm and even moarvm-debugsource-2020.01.1-57.1.x86_64.rpm getting generated
