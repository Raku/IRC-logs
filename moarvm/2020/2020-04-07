[04:28] <diginet> where could I find some decent info on 6model?

[05:33] <moritz> diginet: https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course/blob/master/src/slides-day2.md maybe?

[08:06] <brrt> how's quarantine?

[08:07] <lizmat> tbh, for someone who has been mainly working from home for the past 20+ years, not a lot has changed

[08:07] <brrt> :-D

[08:07] <lizmat> but am glad we're still able to a bicycle ride every day, including in Germany

[08:08] <lizmat> too bad we're not allowed into Belgium atm, so that approximately halves the area in which we can cycle

[08:08] <lizmat> and no restaurants along the way  :-(

[08:08] <lizmat> yes, we're suffering here  :-)

[08:09] <lizmat> oh, with all the trees in full bloom, the pollen make us quite sniffy

[09:17] <timotimo> when's the last time someone tried jemalloc on moar and raku?

[09:46] <timotimo> i don't actually know what areas jemalloc excels in the most

[09:47] <timotimo> and we've got multiple custom allocators for our Very Special Requirements™

[14:09] <timotimo> pahole's got some holes for us to stuff

[14:34] <timotimo> haha, my manual attempts at reordering made it worse actually

[14:41] <timotimo> nope! i was just too tired to notice that i was diffing pahole output the wrong way around

[14:46] <timotimo> making short-lived structs smaller isn't worth very much, tho, of course

[14:46] <timotimo> or structs that only have few instances made

[14:47] <timotimo> MVMNormalizer is one of the two, but not sure which. but it shrunk from 56 to 48

[14:47] <timotimo> MVMDecodeStream from 144 to 136

[14:53] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: Give MVMSpeshAnn an "order" field, use it for comments

[14:53] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: 

[14:53] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: I hope this can be insightful when something odd happens

[14:53] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: and the order of optimizations spesh does is important.
