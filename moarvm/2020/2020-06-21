[12:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 0racle++ created pull request #1317: Pre-declare loop vars.

[12:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1317

[12:48] <nwc10> ftp.unicode.org-- # For some reason their new (or current) ftp server doesn't work with how curl does FTP URLs. (wget seems to be fine)

[12:52] <nwc10> might actually be a curl bug. (IIRC there's some crazy thing about who paths you send to the FTP server should not be abssolute unless the FTP URL has a // after the hostname)

[12:53] <nwc10> but you don't hit this if you ensure that your anon FTP user's home directory is /

[12:53] <nwc10> and IIRC you definately do hit it if your daft enough to have your server permissions set up such that `chdir /` is not allowed

[13:54] <nwc10> for the avoidance of doubt, I'm not planning to (try to) upgrade to Uncode 13.0

[14:00] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: ftp.unicode.org no longer works with curl's default ftp method.

[14:00] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[14:00] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Adding --ftp-method nocwd seems to fix this.

[19:00] <samcv> nwc10, so you got it working?

[19:00] <nwc10> I got the download part (msotly) working

[19:01] <nwc10> apart from the particular file in emjoi 13.0 which they've moved to a different directory

[19:01] <nwc10> and I hacked the URLs (two different variants; thank you Unicode consortium) to get 12.1 locally

[19:01] <nwc10> and could (almost perfectly) regenerate what we have checked into git

[19:03] <nwc10> then I was singularly failing to get the binary format for the heap profiler working
