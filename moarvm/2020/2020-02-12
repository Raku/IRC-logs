[20:45] <MasterDuke> anyone have an opinion on how i should make rand_I sensitive to srand?

[20:50] *** ChanServ left
[20:51] <lizmat> MasterDuke: I have none

[20:58] <MasterDuke> i guess i could copy their old implementation of mp_rand and mp_rand_digit into moarvm

[20:58] <MasterDuke> that way i'm not trying to implement anything myself
