[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This is a mild generalization of the Rakudo Scalar container descriptor

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: that removes the reliance on precise P6opaque layout. It was planned to

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: move this into MoarVM after the last round of Scalar refactors, however

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: that was never actually done. Doing it now because it will make it much

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: easier to use the offsets to have argument guards to decont/rw-check

[16:21] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: without having to do a function pointer call.

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix interned callsites getting leaked when fixing up inlines

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Interned callsites are no longer owned by the comp unit but by the instance.

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: This means that we also do not free them when the comp unit gets garbage

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: collected. It also means that it should be safe to reuse the existing pointer

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: when adding an interned callsite to a comp unit (e.g. when inlining across

[16:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: comp unit boundaries).

[17:21] <nine> But it may be easier to fix now. Unless the fix is actually just freeing the old st->container_data (if there is one) in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6baf0de4af#diff-8dc501819c44ea96db1a2b762c73e6ddR387

[18:19] <MasterDuke> nine: adding `if (st->container_data) MVM_free(st->container_data);` gets `valgrind --leak-check=full raku --full-cleanup -e ''` to report `(definitely|indirectly|possibly) lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks`

[18:19] <MasterDuke> does say `still reachable: 1,677 bytes in 5 blocks` though

[18:20] <MasterDuke> but those are all dlopen related

[18:27] <nine> I know. I've been running with this patch for a week now

[18:27] <nine> But I don't know if that's the right thing to do

[18:28] <MasterDuke> PR and see if jnthn, timotimo, etc have any thoughts?

[18:29] <nine> Yeah, that's the proper way to do this :)
