[16:23] <[Coke]> o/

[16:25] <brrt> everyone still healthy around here?

[16:26] <MasterDuke> doing ok so far

[16:27] <jnthn> I'm better from my throat infection that made me cancel one of my GPRW talks :)

[16:27] <jnthn> But I think the unreasonably warm February has made something blossom early...

[16:32] <MasterDuke> that somehow manages to sound both nice and ominous

[16:39] <jnthn> The nice outweighs the ominous; I don't suffer too badly from those allergies.

[16:41] <jnthn> I used to think it was odd that I always seemed to have a mild cold through a load of spring. Was only in the last years I realized...d'oh, it's not a mild cold... :P

[16:42] *** kid51 joined
[16:42] <jnthn> (Or rather, had it pointed out to me...)

[16:43] *** kid51 left
[16:43] <MasterDuke> i never had any allergies in the US, but the entire (almost) year we've been UK i've had some mild allergies

[16:44] <MasterDuke> jnthn: btw, just noticed that loop() problem is related to protos/multis

[16:44] <MasterDuke> m: class FOO { our proto sub foo($) {*}; multi sub foo(Int $n) { my @a = ^$n; my $b; loop (my $i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) { $b = @a[$i] }; $b }; }; say FOO::foo(1_000_000); say now - INIT now

[16:45] <MasterDuke> m: class FOO { our sub foo(Int $n) { my @a = ^$n; my $b; loop (my $i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) { $b = @a[$i] }; $b }; }; say FOO::foo(1_000_000); say now - INIT now

[16:45] <jnthn> Hm, intersting

[16:45] <jnthn> *interesting

[16:47] <MasterDuke> a spesh log of the proto/multi version has ~850 entries of 'Latest statistics for ' foo/<unit>/MAIN/a bunch more

[16:47] <MasterDuke> a spesh log of the single version as 10 entries for them

[17:25] <timotimo> jnthn: i've been doing a "monthly injection to lessen allergy symptoms" thing. can not say whether it helps or not, but it's fun

[17:30] <MasterDuke> i thought at first the 'after' spesh of `foo` was different in the two examples, but when i set MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 they turned out to be identical (not the entire logs of course, they still had the discrepancies in 'Latest statistics for' lines)

[17:37] <MasterDuke> another data point. the proto/multi version had almost 1m 'OSR hits' by the end of the log. the single sub version had 300

[17:44] <MasterDuke> from a profile of the no proto version: 5174 call frames were entered and exited by the profiled code. Inlining eliminated the need to create 10996665 call frames (that's 99.95%). 

[17:44] <linkable6> (2017-08-06) https://github.com/rgmcrary/Train-Scheduler/commit/109966659e Finalize

[17:44] <MasterDuke> from the proto version: 4003706 call frames were entered and exited by the profiled code. Inlining eliminated the need to create 6998169 call frames (that's 63.61%).
