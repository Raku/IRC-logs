[09:20] <lizmat> nwc10 o.

[09:20] <lizmat> o/ rather :-)

[09:20] <nwc10> \o

[09:21] <nwc10> It's raining. My choices seem to be (1) veg out (2) hack (3) claer up the cellar

[09:22] <nwc10> "watching regression tests run" counts as hacking, doesn't it? :-)

[09:25] <lizmat> do they ever boil?

[09:26] <nwc10> "eventually", it seems

[09:26] <nwc10> but my probem now is actually, that to make coffee I need to boil the kettle, and that involves getting up

[09:28] <lizmat> BREW not working on your HTCPCP server ?

[09:49] <nwc10> :-)

[09:49] <nwc10> no, and even worse than that, due to $weekend, I needed to wash the French press first

[09:50] <nwc10> $weekend had 2 meals $elsewhere, so did not generate much excitement for the dishwasher

[09:58] *** dogbert17 left
[10:19] <nwc10> dogbert17: yes, that was my assumption to. I think that it has to be an existing corner-case bug that I've exposed. So, I've added similar code to MoarVM master, and now I have that one looping until the test fails

[10:19] <tellable6> nwc10, I'll pass your message to dogbert17

[10:20] <nwc10> and this time also looping the first such that it should generate a coredump when it hits oops. But, of course, it hasn't

[10:20] <nwc10> that thing about "does it ever boil?" :-/

[10:22] <nwc10> maybe I should go off and clean up the cellar

[14:52] <[Coke]> nwc10: you said that you have a tester for your xxx-hash branch on windows, yes? (once he gets back?)

[14:52] <[Coke]> I am doing a "regular" build right now (was a few months out of date), and remembered you might need a tester but were probably set

[14:53] <nwc10> I was assuming that jnthn would be able to

[14:54] <[Coke]> \o/

[14:54] <[Coke]> (good because it's not fast on this box. :)

[14:56] *** zakharyas joined
[14:56] <MasterDuke> i don't remember jnthn doing anything on windows recently?

[14:57] <MasterDuke> i thought he used to develop on windows (mostly as a canary), but for some reason istr he switched off (new computer a while ago?)

[20:49] <guifa2> Not sure if this is a known thing, but I think I've stumbled across a MoarVM error. 

[20:50] <guifa2> When I have a declared multidimensional native array, things work okay, until they're placed in a module that's used by something else

[20:50] <guifa2> my int16 @foo[2;2] = (1,2), (3,4); # problematic line

[20:51] <guifa2> The error message is "Missing serialize REPR function for REPR MVMContext (BOOTContext)".  If it's a Rakudo bug though happy to report it elsewhere

[21:22] <lizmat> it is my understanding that BootContexts should indeed never be serialized,

[21:22] <lizmat> so apparently the codegen of that piece of code, is dragging in more than it should

[21:22] <lizmat> think this is really a Rakudo bug

[22:02] * guifa2 nods head.  I'll try to fully golf the context to make sure it's reproducible beyond my larger code base and post it to Rakudo issues
