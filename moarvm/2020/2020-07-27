[00:22] <timotimo> annoyingly, creating dtrace probes at runtime is a bit funky

[00:23] <timotimo> there's a bunch of trace points i could imagine could be interesting to have

[00:26] <timotimo> around module loading and precompilation for example?

[00:42] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/498426619ac7d3f97684520f69cd3f71 - does this seem interesting at all?

[00:45] <timotimo> (have to run trace with -Z256 to get full paths for all the precomp paths)

[00:46] <timotimo> 256 isn't enough lol

[00:46] <timotimo> but using 512 gets a compilation error for the bpf program, because it has a stack size limit of 512 bytes apparentl

[07:14] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[07:16] <nwc10> when is the next release, and where should I have looked to find that out without asking a human?

[07:24] <Altai-man_> nwc10, moarvm release or rakudo release?

[07:25] <nwc10> MoarVM release. 

[07:26] <Altai-man_> Go to http://moarvm.org/ and it should be pretty straightforward.

[07:26] <nwc10> actually, I thought that both happened about the same time, and "not breaking Rakudo" tends to be more important :-)

[07:26] <Altai-man_> Another page is https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases

[07:26] <Altai-man_> With those you can get them without asking anyone. :)

[07:29] <nwc10> I can't spot any planned date for the next release, and it's not obvious that it's (say) "every month about the 20th" because there are gaps

[07:29] <Altai-man_> nwc10, there are planned dates for rakudo, see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod but they are floating in general, because things.

[07:30] <Altai-man_> So I wouldn't bet my money on next release date, but I can say "It is very likely and we will really try our best to deliver it".

[07:31] <nwc10> ah "things". Yes, sigh, I seem to know about "things".

[07:31] <nwc10> But thanks - make sure things are in a "safe releasable state before 2020-08-22" is a very useful answer

[07:32] <Altai-man_> I mean, people can discover tricky bugs a day before release and we won't ship something broken because release date.

[07:37] <nine> releasable6: status

[07:37] <releasable6> nine, Next release in â‰ˆ26 days and â‰ˆ11 hours. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[08:56] <MasterDuke> uh

[08:57] <MasterDuke> that was supposed to be an update to my fork to fix the merge conflict in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1286

[08:57] <MasterDuke> $work for a bit, but i

[08:57] <MasterDuke> 'll try to undo that after

[09:48] *** Geth_ joined
[09:54] *** Geth_ left
[09:55] <MasterDuke> hm. looks like i'd have to rewrite history for everybody to undo that. guess i'll let jnthn decide whether to just leave as is or do a revert commit and merge it in again at some later point

[09:56] <nwc10> MasterDuke: jnthn is on holiday for the next week and a bit

[09:57] <MasterDuke> .tell jnthn i accidentally pushed https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/fda7058dda when trying to fix a conflict with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1286 in my fork. i don't want to rewrite history for others, so please feel free to revert if you want

[09:57] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[09:58] <MasterDuke> nwc10: yeah, but i don't think there's any urgency, that was to a branch, not master, so hopefully shouldn't cause any problems until he resumes new-disp work

[09:58] <nwc10> oh, I missed the "branch" part.

[09:58] <nwc10> clearly this new coffee isn't quite good enough :-)

[10:00] <MasterDuke> apparently mine isn't either. i'm not quite sure how that happened, i usually need to explicitly mention "upstream" (which i definitely didn't) or stuff goes to my fork

[22:48] <timotimo> currently does it the same way spesh does, i.e. if there's no cache, or if there's a need to run code to find the method, it'll just return null for now

[23:15] <timotimo> .o( i wonder if p6-moar-remote and/or p6-app-moarvm-debug should report commits here )

[23:36] <timotimo> do i put in a new message type "code outer request" to get from an MVMCode to its outer, or should Outer Context Request continue giving an MVMContext's outer, but if passed an MVMCode, it'd return an MVMCode outer instead
