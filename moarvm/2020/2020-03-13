[10:43] <kawaii> I don't know if here or #raku is the best place to ask for help about this, but I'm getting the following error today from one of my Perl 6 programs and I have no idea why or what it means :D

[10:43] <kawaii> `MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler`

[10:43] <moritz> it means you've hit a bug in the rakudo + moarvm combo

[10:43] <kawaii> it happens as a result of `return $m;` here, if that helps :) https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/U36KytR6/

[10:43] <moritz> ... but I guess you knew that already :D

[10:44] <moritz> kawaii: that return returns out of the outer routine, not just the callback you passed to .then(). Intentional?

[10:47] *** Altreus joined
[10:49] <kawaii> moritz: seems that we weren't aware of that behaviour, thanks for that information :)

[10:49] <moritz> kawaii: if you replace the 'return $m' by just '$m', you might be fine

[10:50] <moritz> trying to return from a routine that might have already exited might cause weird behavior (though I'd actually hope rakudo would catch such cases)

[10:50] <kawaii> moritz: yep, seems like using just `$m;` fixed my issue there, thanks :)

[10:51] <moritz> you're welcome

[10:53] <nwc10> but even the wrong code still should not panic, surely?

[10:54] <nwc10> oh, hangon, you sort of said that with different words

[10:56] <moritz> I tried :D

[11:09] <Altreus> I think I got confused between P5 and Raku behaviour

[11:09] <Altreus> I assumed that it was a real sub that gets passed to then, but I guess it's just a block

[11:10] <Altreus> Is it always a block when you do -> { }? So return will never apply to that construct but the outer one?

[11:20] <moritz> correct

[11:21] <moritz> bu fo course you write .then(sub ($p) { ... }) to ues a "full" subroutine

[14:24] <Altreus> I see! I had misunderstood -> {} to be a shorthand to a sub

[14:25] <Altreus> cos of the params you see

[14:26] <lizmat> Altreus: you should consider the sub / method syntax as a special case of the generic block syntax, not the other way around

[14:26] <Altreus> ah! OK :)

[14:27] <jnthn> The type system even agrees :)

[14:27] <jnthn> m: say Sub.^mro
