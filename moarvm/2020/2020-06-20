[11:05] <sena_kun> Can anyone please check ^ ?

[11:06] <MasterDuke> hm. where was i with that Proc::Async sometimes slowdown weirdness?

[11:06] <MasterDuke> lots of time spent in MVM_gc_root_add_frame_roots_to_worklist and MVM_gc_root_add_frame_registers_to_worklist, but hadn't figured out why i think

[11:34] * sena_kun prepares a build to upload

[13:01] <lizmat> Altai-man_ I think a whitespace only change is not really a change  :-)

[13:03] <Altai-man_> lizmat, rendering on the website was broken, sweeping all the categories under one, which is a failure. I did not rebuild the tarball, since that's relatively ok, I guess.

[13:03] <lizmat> yeah... that's what I meant  :-)

[13:35] <MasterDuke> i enabled the GC_DEBUG_LOG and get at ton of output. one line is `Thread 1 run 238 : processing 318048 items from in tray`. is that a lot of items?

[13:58] <MasterDuke> hm. the largest "processing" value when compiling CORE.c is only 20k

[14:00] <MasterDuke> ah. and if the perl being executed is is `for(1..100_000)` instead of `while(1)` then it's only 36k

[14:03] <MasterDuke> looking at a profile of the `for(1..100_000)` version, 200k BOOTCodes are allocated at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Proc/Async.pm6#L100 `has @.command is List;`?

[14:56] *** sena_kun joined
[14:57] *** Altai-man_ left
[15:43] <timotimo> MasterDuke: can you get a speshlog and find the same filename / line number to see what code that corresponds to?

[15:45] <MasterDuke> `Latest statistics for ''`

[15:45] <MasterDuke> `Total hits: 1`

[15:46] <MasterDuke> ... `1 x type List (Conc)`; `1 x static frame 'new' (5414) (caller is outer: 0, multi 0)`; `1 x type tuple: Type 0: List (TypeObj)`

[15:46] *** zakharyas joined
[15:47] <MasterDuke> the cuid also shows up in the Proc::Async.BUILDALL

[15:49] <MasterDuke> i don't think i've ever seen a `has` show up in a profile/spesh log before

[15:50] <timotimo> i'd expect it to show up when you have a = in there that does some kind of calculation

[15:50] *** zakharyas left
[15:52] <MasterDuke> the code being run is just: `my $proc = Proc::Async.new: "perl", "-E", q|for(1..100_000) { say "y" x 100 }|; react { whenever $proc.stdout.lines { say "stdout: $_"; }; whenever $proc.stderr.lines { say "stderr: $_"; }; whenever $proc.start { say "Exit code: {.exitcode}"; done; } }`

[15:52] <timotimo> well, how is "has foo is bar" implemented?

[15:52] <timotimo> that could have something to do with it

[15:53] <MasterDuke> dunno. but `class A { has @.c is List; }; my $a; $a = A.new(:c([$_,])) for ^100_000; say $a` doesn't show the same thing in a profile

[15:53] <timotimo> interesting

[15:58] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit, but let me know if you have any suggestions
