[07:33] <nwc10> the fixed size allocator is global (enough) that one can allocate from it in one thread, and free that pointer in another?

[07:57] <nwc10> timotimo: debugserver.c uses HASH_ITER instead of HASH_ITER_FAST. Does that make sense? In that, if you have access to the debug server, do you already "have the keys to the kingdom"?

[07:57] <nwc10> ie, there's no point in attempting to keep the random hash secrets secret

[07:57] <nwc10> can you inject code with the debug server?

[08:06] <MasterDuke> why do we use MVM_string_ascii_encode instead of MVM_string_utf8_encode_C_string to create a string for an error message in some places?

[09:19] <jnthn> morning o/

[09:19] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Maybe in the cases where we know it's an ASCII string?

[09:21] <MasterDuke> that makes sense

[09:21] <jnthn> nwc10: About the FSA: yes, and it even has mitigation for the case where you have a producer/consumer thing that allocates a lot on one thread and threads a lot on another.

[09:25] <nwc10> jnthn: in copy_to in MVMHash.c there's a MVM_gc_write_barrier(). In copy_to in HashAttrStore.c there is not. Is that omission a bug?

[09:26] <nwc10> I'm not sure what the uncitiondional write barrier call is about

[09:26] <nwc10> IIRC the write barrier is to maintain the invariant that gen2 objects can't point to nursery objects (without the GC knowing)

[09:27] <nwc10> and I forget if there's a Fine Manual that I'm supposed to have Read.

[09:27] <MasterDuke> i guess we just declare that REPR names are ascii only?

[09:28] <nwc10> Given how far Unicode is going with combining emojii characters, I think that I'd be fine (ish) with this.

[09:29] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Yes, there's no reason we'd do otherwise

[09:31] <MasterDuke> and the string heap is ascii-only also?

[09:31] <jnthn> nwc10: copy_to is always used as part of a clone operation, so the dest_root would always be in the nursury

[09:32] <jnthn> MasterDuke: No, the string heap can from bytecode files can contain anything

[09:32] <jnthn> nwc10: So the barriering in there is abundance of caution

[09:32] <nwc10> OK. I saw seeming inconsistency and assumed one of them had to be wrong

[09:33] <MasterDuke> jnthn: then https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L2164 might not be safe?

[09:34] <nwc10> jnthn: in the nursery unless a "force gen2" is enabled?

[09:35] <jnthn> nwc10: I guess, yes, though quite when we'd be doing a clone is another matter...

[09:35] <jnthn> *doing a clone while in that mode

[09:35] <jnthn> Anyway, the safe thing is to do it, the fast thing that's probably right (and could be asserted) is to not

[09:36] <nwc10> but the macro version of the write barrier avoids the function call if not needed?

[09:36] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Yeah, if we have, for example, a non-ASCII filename, I think we'd be in trouble there

[09:36] <jnthn> nwc10: Correct

[09:36] <jnthn> Well, I think that the function you mentioned is an inline function

[09:36] <jnthn> Rather than a macro

[09:37] <jnthn> MVM_ASSIGN_REF is a macro, I think

[09:37] <jnthn> So...what was I doing on Monday...

[09:37] <jnthn> oh right, sigsegv :)

[09:37] <nwc10> jnthn: sadly not. It's in src/gc/wb.c

[09:38] <MasterDuke> jnthn: ah, that's a filename? then MVM_string_utf8_c8_encode_C_string is probably the right choice?

[09:38] <jnthn> Which bit?

[09:38] <nwc10> I figure that I should make a patch and send it to you for review

[09:38] <jnthn> MasterDuke: yes

[09:38] <nwc10>         MVM_gc_write_barrier(tc, &(dest_root->header), &(key->common.header));

[09:39] <nwc10> and in src/gc/wb.c: void MVM_gc_write_barrier_hit(MVMThreadContext *tc, MVMCollectable *update_root)

[09:39] <jnthn> MVM_STATIC_INLINE void MVM_gc_write_barrier(MVMThreadContext *tc, MVMCollectable *update_root, MVMCollectable *referenced) {

[09:39] <jnthn> Yes, notice the extra _hit

[09:39] <nwc10> oh, dammit yes

[09:39] <nwc10> I didn't

[09:39] <nwc10> thanks

[09:39] <nwc10> seems that *everyone's* coffee is better than mine

[09:39] <nwc10> clearly I need to get back to the office, where the coffee is "curated by others"

[09:39] <jnthn> And since I was in there: yes, MVM_ASSIGN_REF is a macro. Actually one defined in different ways depending on GC debugging or not

[18:29] <timotimo> something is wrong with my keyboard or something

[18:29] <nwc10> jnthn: and you were pretty much correct - PEBKAC

[18:30] <nwc10> in that, I had the wrong nqp checkout. (with the "Right" MoarVM checkout)

[19:14] <jnthn> nwc10: Ah, this explains quite a bit

[19:14] <nwc10> indeed :-/

[19:34] <jnthn> Hm, did the ASAN barf on that test you mentioned before go away?

[19:34] <nwc10> yes, ASAN barfed on that test now that I used the correct checkout

[20:08] <timotimo> i also get that segv, or at least i think that's the one

[20:09] <timotimo> it's where it gets an out-of-range extop number

[20:09] <timotimo> not sure what exactly i got wrong :)

[20:11] <jnthn> timotimo++ for fixing bytecode dumping just in time for me needing it 

[20:11] *** sena_kun left
[20:12] <timotimo> nice

[20:13] <jnthn> Got something really odd going on where one dispatcher ends up producing a null return value even though the bytecode it invokes should never do that

[20:13] <jnthn> Not immediately sure what's to blame

[20:17] <jnthn> aha, it ends up getting a NULL arg into it

[20:25] <jnthn> Duh, that was a silly one

[20:25] <timotimo> :D

[20:26] <jnthn> And of course my test cases managed to get lucky and not trigger the bug

[20:27] *** zakharyas left
[20:41] <jnthn> And now I seem to have a working decont return value impl using the dispatcher instead of the spesh plugin

[20:41] <jnthn> The most common cases don't need to do an invoke (unlike spesh plugins which assumed you were always going to do one)

[20:42] <jnthn> Though the fact we have got both type check and decont done as two separate dispatchers will have to go away at some point

[20:44] <jnthn> (That is the case 'cus there were two spesh plugins, which is the case 'cus there were two ext ops)

[20:45] <timotimo> is that not necessary to do return vs return-rw?

[20:49] <jnthn> Well, those cases need different handling, but we don't need to do it as one dispatch after another

[20:49] <jnthn> There's probably a neat factoring in terms of delegated dispatch actually

[20:50] <jnthn> The way dispatch programs are recorded and compiled automatically does duplicate read and duplicate guard elimination

[20:50] <jnthn> Up to and including on paths of reads

[20:51] <jnthn> So we could even have one dispatcher delegate to the other and even if it duplicately requests guarding or reading of attributes, the compiled dispatch program will still only do it once.

[20:53] <jnthn> The whole "you can delegate, but you're still writing one dispatch program overall" thing is one of the ideas that's worked out really well in this. I'm not exactly sure at what point I realized it.

[20:55] <timotimo> cool

[21:46] <timotimo> switch (cur_bb->last_ins->info->opcode) {

[21:46] <timotimo> i wonder which one of these breaks

[21:47] <timotimo> could it be something isn't breaking up bbs correctly around dispatch_* ops?
