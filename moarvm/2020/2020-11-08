[15:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/MVMROOT-in-box-foo: 868de8cc7f | Use MVM_repr_box_{int,num,str,uint} directly in interp.c

[15:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/MVMROOT-in-box-foo: 9b9de0aba4 | graph.c now calls MVM_repr_box_{int,num,str} directly.

[15:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/MVMROOT-in-box-foo: 60b47f62ef | The template JIT now calls {MVM_repr_box_int,str} directly.

[15:36] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/MVMROOT-in-box-foo: 175525cef6 | Replace `MVM_unbox_str` with `MVM_repr_get_str` and eliminate the former.

[15:39] <nwc10> .tell brrt I can see that unbox_u is not in core_templates.expr, and box_u is in neither, and it looks easy to add either/both/whatever, but which JIT is current? And is it right to edit both?

[15:39] <tellable6> nwc10, I'll pass your message to brrt

[15:39] <nwc10> of course, anyone else can answer too :-)

[15:42] <MasterDuke> it used to have to be in both for the template to actually get run, but i think that isn't the case anymore

[15:42] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i usually add to both

[15:47] <nine> yeah, if in doubt, add it to both

[15:47] <nwc10> to be sure to be sure?

[15:48] <nine> The expression jit doesn't cover all situations that the lego jit does. So having both will help

[15:49] <nwc10> aha
