[09:05] <jnthn> good morning

[09:05] <jnthn> nwc10: Remind me, is anything blocking on me for the hash branch at this point? Will have some time to look at it soon if so.

[09:16] <nwc10> I'm not aware of anything blocking

[09:16] <nwc10> I believe that I have made commits that answer your questions

[09:16] <jnthn> releasable6: status

[09:16] <nwc10> *don't* merge it (as-is) because it has that commit message that starts 'XXX'

[09:16] <releasable6> jnthn, Next release in â‰ˆ4 days and â‰ˆ9 hours. 2 blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[09:16] <releasable6> jnthn, Details: https://gist.github.com/74a76b4b4b4e61b6edc2c4b41ae63b4e

[09:17] <jnthn> *nod*

[09:17] <nwc10> and I have a suspicion that we should wait for 4 days and 10 hours before merging it :-)

[09:17] <nwc10> the NQP tests (and implied NQP language spec) PR is also "interesting" if you have time

[09:18] <nwc10> I was about to go out shopping. (back in an hour I guess)

[09:18] <nwc10> we're fine for beer, but critically low on sherry

[09:18] <nwc10> (and milk and other stuff)

[09:18] <jnthn> oh deer

[09:18] <jnthn> *dear

[09:18] <jnthn> bah

[09:18] <nwc10> use more 'coffee' ?

[09:19] <jnthn> Whenever I drink sherry my thoughts are "I wish this was port instead" :)

[09:19] <nwc10> I have some white port, but not the red stuff

[09:19] <nwc10> Andrea's dad has ruby port, but I think that he mostly uses it for cooking.

[09:20] <nwc10> anyway, I'm told that sherry casks are always in short supply for whisky making, so I'll keep doing my bit to help

[09:20] <nwc10> (I have no idea how accurate this statement is. I was told it by someone who IIRC had been told it at a whisky tasting. It might be true.)

[09:24] <jnthn> Ah, the red stuff is what I like :)

[11:49] <nwc10> jnthn: also, I don't know how to (so have not) tested the debug server or the heap profiler, which IIRC get touched as a side effect of hashes

[12:30] *** zakharyas joined
[12:30] <jnthn> Looked over the commits; agree they address all my comments.

[12:30] * [Coke] wonders if whisky vs. whiskey is a UK/US thing.

[12:34] <jnthn> Hmm...I just installed App::MoarVM::HeapAnalyzer and tried to run it on the produced heap profile output and it reports malformed UTF-8

[12:34] <jnthn> timotimo: Any idea about ^^?

[12:38] <nwc10> [Coke]: it's certainly a Scotland vs Ireland thing

[12:38] <nwc10> jnthn: \o/

[12:39] <jnthn> The debugger seems busted though

[12:39] <nwc10> and also, I didn't have any better suggestions for the debug server thing than I'd already put in the comment in the code (which appeared near your question to timotimo )

[12:39] <nwc10> :-(

[12:39] <nwc10> I don't know enough to fix that. (As in, even where to start)

[12:41] <jnthn> Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)

[12:42] <nwc10> I don't even know where TFM is for the debug server, so I don't know how to start it

[12:42] <jnthn> There's a command line client but I don't know how to use it :P

[12:42] <nwc10> so you use netcat?

[12:42] <jnthn> No, I use it from the IDE :)

[12:47] <jnthn> https://gist.github.com/jnthn/bef407c806db596ce16ecd042f869c70

[12:47] <jnthn> Seems to happen when it hits a breakpoint

[12:47] <jnthn> Ah, well, more to the point, when it is handling a follow-up request after hitting a breakpoint

[12:48] <nwc10> this is a regression in the branch?

[12:49] <nwc10> hashtable=0x0

[12:50] <jnthn> Well, I think that thing can legitimately be null'

[12:50] <jnthn> And indeed adding a null check there fixes things

[12:50] <nwc10> yes, and IIRC NULL is a "valid" UT hash

[12:52] <jnthn> Yeah, I think so to

[12:52] *** sena_kun joined
[12:52] <jnthn> Or at least, not distinguishable from an empty hash

[12:52] <jnthn> Shall I push a commit fixing it?

[12:52] <nwc10> yes please

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: Don't try to use a NULL debug locals hash

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: 

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: Under the previous hash implementation, the hash pointer being NULL was

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: interpreted as an empty hash, and thus a lookup would just come back

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: NULL and there was no problem. Under the new one, we should NULL-check

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: it explicitly. Fixes a crash in the debug server.

[12:54] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/AAAA-A-better-hash: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2af3ffbf60

[12:55] <jnthn> I looked if there's any other instances of the problem with the debug locals, but it seems that was the only one

[12:56] *** angelds joined
[12:56] <nwc10> I had a look in that file, and couldn't spot any others

[12:56] <jnthn> OK

[12:56] <jnthn> I think for now that's all I have :)

[12:57] <nwc10> time, or bugs?

[12:57] <jnthn> Bugs.

[12:57] <jnthn> I have time but want to spend it on my RakuAST grant, which I barely touched in the last month, though mostly 'cus I had the audacity to go on vacation :)

[12:59] <moritz> jnthn: speaking of which, it's mid of the month, and nominally time for the grant report

[12:59] <nwc10> expect a report with pictures of Swiss hills?

[12:59] <jnthn> haha, yeah...

[13:00] <moritz> jnthn: there's bascially two options: 1) publish a "I did nothing" grant report, or 2) we move the grant report the start of the month, and I'll publish one start of September

[13:00] <[Coke]> a grant report of 'was busy with things including vacation' is an acceptable report. :)

[13:00] <jnthn> moritz: I was going to write it at the end of this week and account for what I did this week in it so it'll be mildly more exciting :)

[13:00] <moritz> jnthn: works fine for me
