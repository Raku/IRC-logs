[15:17] <sena_kun> for the record: we can release after https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3433 is resolved

[16:38] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1221 now is green in CI (except for codefactor, but they're all just complex method complaints, which i don't think we can avoid)

[16:39] <MasterDuke> i hope this can get merged right after the rakudo release so it can get some testing

[16:42] *** sena_kun left
[16:48] <MasterDuke> oh right, but i was going to make some modifications so we get better errors in expmod. well, those would be minor, i'd love it if anybody could take a look at the state now and see if it's good to go
