[20:21] <patrickb> ^ This is not pretty. But any more correct solution ends up being a lot more complex.

[20:21] <patrickb> nine: ^

[21:01] <nine> patrickb: this ^^^ got rid of the problem

[21:04] <patrickb> nine: Accepted. :-)

[21:44] <lizmat> perhaps inspirational: https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/03/TornadoVM-QCon-London/

[21:45] <lizmat> ah, forget it: "Due to limitations in the underlying programming model, TornadoVM doesnâ€™t support objects (except for trivial cases), recursion, dynamic memory allocation or exceptions."
