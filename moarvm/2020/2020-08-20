[20:14] *** dogbert12 left
[20:15] *** dogbert17 left
[20:16] <timotimo> how are things?

[20:16] <timotimo> is the dispatch chains mechanism making you excited? :)

[20:20] *** dogbert17 joined
[20:22] <timotimo> i was thinking some time ago that it could be a natural mechanism to handle dispatching to the right devirtualized candidate for, say, a VMArray's at_pos for all the variants of slot kinds

[20:22] *** dogbert11 left
[20:22] <timotimo> currently that's hard-coded, which isn't great, but the results are good enough

[20:24] <timotimo> and when reprops will all go via the dispatch op so that we can elide checks of all kinds at spesh time it'll be sort-of natural already

[20:54] *** Altai-man left
[21:02] <brrt> I'm sorry I haven't even followed the dispatch chain thing :-S

[21:03] <brrt> what is it about?

[21:04] <timotimo> it's an implementation of a paper called something with like  "zero-overhead metaprogramming" in the title

[21:06] <brrt> heh, that sounds like it should be interesting to us

[21:12] <timotimo> yup

[21:13] <timotimo> it's already replaced every spesh plugin in rakudo if i remember correctly

[21:13] <timotimo> but i haven't implemented "turning a dispatch recording to spesh graph of guards" for all ops that can occur

[21:20] <timotimo>  every dispatch chain sits a boot-dispatcher which we can implement rather directly in the jit or even spesh

[21:20] <timotimo> some invoke a code eobject, which spesh can inline

[21:20] <timotimo> some invvoke a C function, which the jit can turn into a low-level call

[21:26] <timotimo> and of course for some C functions we can have simpler implementations in the jit itself
