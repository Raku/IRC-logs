[10:15] <jnthn> morning o/

[10:15] <nwc10> \o

[10:15] <nwc10> new office coffee machine is impressive

[10:15] <jnthn> does it know when it's run out of beans?

[10:16] <jnthn> 'cus ours doesn't and $coworker just got a cup of slighlty brown water :)

[10:18] <nwc10> it's a manual grind thingy, so the wetware operative has to move the beans from the grinder to the machine proper

[10:18] <nwc10> it's one of these https://www.cimbali.at/produkte/siebtragermaschinen/m26

[10:19] *** brrt left

[10:46] <dogbert11> Jura, makes me think of a Scottish beverage
