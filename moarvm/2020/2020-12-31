[19:47] <nwc10> That really is the most awesome man page

[19:47] <nwc10> https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29034/getrusage-3c.html

[19:47] <nwc10> ru_maxrss      The maximum resident set size. Size is given in pages (the size of a page, in bytes, is given by the getpagesize(3C) function). See the NOTES section of this page.

[19:47] <nwc10> ...

[19:47] <nwc10> more ...

[19:47] <nwc10> yet more ...

[19:47] <nwc10> The ru_maxrss, ru_ixrss, ru_idrss, and ru_isrss members of the rusage structure are set to 0 in this implementation.

[19:47] <nwc10> fooled you!

[19:48] <nwc10> (gah, typo)

[19:49] <nwc10> (there is no spell checker on the Solaris machine, and I failed to check it again when I tested it on linxu)

[21:15] <nwc10> phew. Would have been bad if the New Year started with a broken build

[21:56] <cog> Are local C functions allowed in MoarVM ?

[21:59] <cog> A ittle early for westerners. But happy new year 2021. Better than 2020. Setting the bar very low.
