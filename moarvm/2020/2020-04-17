[08:17] <nine> dogbert17: I think my heap profiler segfault is related to yours. It's also about a gen2 object that got at least part of it overwritten

[08:17] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to dogbert17

[08:41] <nine> It tries to process a string from a comp unit's string heap. The string itself is already freed from gen2, but the comp unit itself isn't

[08:56] <nine> The string gets freed _after_ getting added to the comp unit's strings list, both of which seems to happen within the same GC run.

[08:57] <nwc10> nine: so you're making progress on debugging your crazy problem?

[08:57] <MasterDuke> huh, the branchlut2 code at https://github.com/miloyip/itoa-benchmark is actually a little slower than the naive version. wonder if that's just one my architecture...

[08:58] <MasterDuke> when i use it in our MVM_coerce_i_s that is

[09:04] <nine> nwc10: indeed. It's starting to make sense. The heap profiler creates a snapshot as part of gc_finish. It gets the file name for a static frame from a bytecode annotation. That file name obviously lives in the comp unit's string heap and gets added to the comp unit's list of deserialized strings.

[09:04] <nine> Those strings get allocated in gen2 by default, because comp units usually are long lived and so are their strings (and maybe other reasons).

[09:05] <nine> But, we're currently in gc_finish. And only after the heap snapshot gets taken do we free the unmarked objects. This includes our newly born string, as it wasn't alive yet in the marking phase

[09:06] <MasterDuke> heh. just saved 100m instructions off my benchmark, but still 100m more than the naive version

[11:54] <MasterDuke> the hobgoblin imperial ruby ale i just had was pretty good. but i'll admit i was surprised at how minimal the selection of good craft beers is here in england (at least in the supermarkets i've been to). i've been told there's a good beer store nearby, but i only found out about it right before the lockdown...

[11:55] <MasterDuke> jnthn: yeah, it requires https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1267 . but that part could easily be removed if undesired by itself

[11:55] <jnthn> The craft beer store here is doing delivery during lockdown, so I put in an order.

[12:56] <jnthn> Is that just the missing MoarVM change?

[12:57] <jnthn> *bit

[12:57] <MasterDuke> yeah, "encode requires an empty array"

[13:00] <dogbert17> nine: this looks a bit suspicious https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/gc/roots.c#L218

[13:01] <dogbert17> there are plenty of tests above that worklist is not null which seems to imply that it CAN be null

[13:08] <dogbert17> heh, worklist is actually set to NULL by the calling code

[13:17] *** sena_kun left
[13:19] <nine> dogbert17: yeah that looks like it could be it

[13:22] <dogbert17> nine: is the proper fix to add a test around line 218 or is something else supposed to be done if worklist is NULL

[13:23] <nine> dogbert17: adding that test should be fine. There doesn't seem to be a describe function we could call instead

[13:24] * lizmat lost what should be merged / bumped in what order

[13:24] <nine> Though this probably means that we're missing information about those spesh plugin guards in the heap profile

[13:27] <dogbert17> will that cause problems?

[13:36] <dogbert17> well, the SEGV seems to be gone

[13:37] <nine> I don't think so. At worst it will just miss some memory usage or shortest paths. Much less of an issue than segfaults...

[13:37] <nine> I'd say commit that change, take your winnings and proceed with what you actually wanted to use the profiler for :)

[13:40] <nine> Btw. I can only recommend reviewing open PRs to all developers regardless of current experience level. The reviews I've done today were both in areas where I had almost no prior exposure and now I have. And as a bonus I found an actual issue with one of them and maybe a way to improve the other one.

[13:42] <nine> It can never hurt to take a look and if you're not a 100 % sure, you can still leave your feedback and leave the actual merging to more experienced or more daring developers :)
