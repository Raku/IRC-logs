[15:32] <Kaiepi> is there way i can set up the makefile so /DUNICODE;_UNICODE is passed to cl when compiling a 3rdparty library, but only that library with msvc on windows?

[15:32] <Kaiepi> or should moarvm work with unicode on windows anyway?

[15:46] <Kaiepi> well, windows' unicode c functions, i mean

[15:53] <[Coke]> unicode works fine on windows, I thought.
