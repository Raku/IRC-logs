[09:29] <MasterDuke> anyone mind taking a quick look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1303 ? i have another small pr in the works, but the two would conflict

[09:34] <patrickb> jnthn: There were no blockers for the PRs except for the problem-solving issue not being resolved. I just rebased and merged the bunch. :-)

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: A string could be a filename, which are the classic example of something

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: that could have non-ASCII and/or non-UTF8 bytes, so use utf8-c8 to

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: encode them.

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Also, every other use of an SC's body->description is via

[09:35] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: MVM_string_utf8_encode_C_string, make that change also.

[09:36] <jnthn> A RakuAST day today rather than dispatcher stuff.

[09:37] <MasterDuke> thanks

[09:39] <jnthn> patrickb: Any ideas on why all PRs to MoarVM seem to report a bunch of CI failures?

[09:39] <jnthn> They look like repository clone failures or some such

[09:40] <patrickb> jnthn: I think it's unable to retrieve the correct repository URL. The logs show "***" for the URL. It's the next thing on my list. :-)

[09:41] <MasterDuke> patrickb: there's also some weirdness about a commit hash it's trying to checkout that doesn't exist

[09:41] <patrickb> MasterDuke: That's the link you sent me, right?

[19:40] <patrickb> samcv: I'm currently trying to replicate the travis CI config in azure CI. There is a LLVM coverage configuration that generates coverage reports on https://moarvm.github.io/coverage/

[19:42] <patrickb> samcv: That's looks broken since 03-07-2018.

[19:44] <patrickb> samcv: I'd appreciate help with migrating and fixing this job. For now I'll copy the build configuration but won't touch the upload of the results.

[20:08] <patrickb> Currently the travis configuration only builds and tests NQP, not rakudo. Do we want to also run rakudo tests?

[20:09] <patrickb> Pro: More testing Con: Failures as soon as Rakudo master is broke.

[20:34] <lizmat> patrickb: the more *real* failures, the better :-)

[20:43] <patrickb> lizmat: That's an argument for both sides. Testing raku will give more failures, both real (if MoarVM breaks rakudo) and false (if rakudo is broke).

[20:45] <lizmat> ah, in that sense...  

[20:46] <lizmat> hmmm... I guess we don't want testing rakudo then

[20:46] <lizmat> as breaking rakudo is much more likely than MoarVM

[21:02] <patrickb> But people did request spectesting. Hm... I'll think about this some more.

[21:04] <patrickb> ^ That's a merge of several AzureCI config changes. We still have to decide what we do about rakudo / spectest builds in MoarVM.

[21:12] <jnthn> tbh, I'd hope that breaking Rakudo *spectests* is at least relatively rare compared to the more general case of "something regressed a module"

[21:12] <jnthn> I mean, folks are mostly good about running spectest before a commit

[21:15] <lizmat> there's that...  :-)
