[12:22] <sena_kun> nwc10, ping?

[12:27] <nwc10> I'm mostly not here.

[12:27] <nwc10> It this an easy question? :-)

[12:27] <nwc10> "sure. All questions are easy. It's only the answers that are hard"

[12:28] <sena_kun> nwc10, VERY EASY. :)

[12:28] <sena_kun> nwc10, any preferences how do you want to be named in rakudo contributors in changelog? The script says just "nwc10", but maybe you want something different like name or?

[12:28] <nwc10> "Nicholas Clark"

[12:29] <sena_kun> Oh, thank you!

[12:29] <sena_kun> Previous releases actually generated that.

[12:29] <nwc10> There's some silly reason why I'm fine with all of Nick, Nicholas, or Nicholas Clark

[12:29] <nwc10> but not the 4th one you could figure from that list :-)

[12:29] <sena_kun> And it is even mentioned above, just repeated as `nwc10`, heh.

[12:30] <nwc10> Thanks for all the good work in keeping releases flowing.

[12:30] <sena_kun> nwc10, have a nice rest on this weekend!

[18:40] <MasterDuke> how about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L3117-L3210 particularly around line 3177? any missing MVMROOTs? i don't know how `REPR(orig_obj)->gc_free(tc, orig_obj)` interacts with anything

[18:50] *** zakharyas joined
[18:50] <nine> MasterDuke: no, because of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L3316

[18:51] <nine> In general, serialization and deserialization run with gen2 allocation active

[18:51] <MasterDuke> arg, didn't notice that, thanks

[18:57] <MasterDuke> want a copy of this rr recording?

[19:10] <nine> Honestly, I'd rather not. Though at some point (probably several months ago) I should really reconsider the cost/benefit of in-process precompilation

[19:12] <nine> I let so many things fall by the wayside in the hopes that after this one issue I'll finally have made it

[20:11] <MasterDuke> heh, no worries. i may give up this particular bug for a while. there's a new problem with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/689 that's cropped up after rebasing to HEAD, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1344 still needs debugging, and the gmp branch is still not mergeable
