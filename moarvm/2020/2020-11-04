[08:32] <patrickb> timotimo, dumarchie: It's a known problem that MoarVM currently can't be built on Windows with MinGW: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1345

[13:52] <timotimo>     probing pthread_setname_np support (optional) ...... YES

[13:53] <timotimo> how do we have pthread_setname_np but not pthread_t

[13:54] <timotimo> do i justâ„¢ need to put an include for pthread.t in the file if this define is set?

[13:54] <nwc10> possibly. I was about to say "because pthread_setname_np is in a header that also happens to cause pthread_t to be defined?"

[13:55] <nwc10> oh, you define it manually

[13:55] <nwc10> OK, and UV doesn't pull in pthread.h on the platform in question?

[13:56] <nwc10> you include it directly in the probe

[13:56] <timotimo> in platform/threads.h we don't include pthread if we are on windows

[13:56] <timotimo> so that else if should perhaps become an endif + ifdef

[13:59] <nwc10> At this point I can't answer helpfully.
