[17:43] <tellable6> 2020-02-03T19:47:39Z #moarvm <patrickb> brrt: Spontaneous GSoC project idea: A mod_moar Apache or Nginx module. You did mod_parrot back in the day. What's your opinion about such a thing? Worth it? Could you imagine mentoring?

[17:43] <tellable6> 2020-02-03T19:48:23Z #moarvm <patrickb> brrt: By the way, did you hear back from pamplemousse?

[17:43] *** patrickb joined
[17:43] <brrt> ohai patrickb

[17:43] <patrickb> o/

[17:43] <brrt> I haven't heard from pamplemousse recently (though I also forgot whether I reached out)

[17:44] <brrt> I don't see much in in-server modules at this point, to be honest

[17:44] <brrt> but maybe there is a FCGI-style protocol that someone could implement

[17:45] <jnthn> One could in principle host a Cro app via the FCGI protocol, though that ain't implemented yet :)

[17:50] <patrickb> Would a Cro FCGI connector be worthwhile to have from a technical point of view?'

[17:51] <jnthn> I guess it's useful to have a range of deployment options

[17:51] <jnthn> Though it's the kind of thing I suspect I could hack out in < 1 day, and so not on its own a GSoC project.

[17:52] <jnthn> Though I suspect there may be various Cro things that together could be of use, if we can find an overarching theme for them.

[18:00] <brrt> hmm, there's that, too :-)

[18:00] <brrt> yeah, infrastructure libraries probably aren't the best fit for a GSoC project

[18:04] <brrt> re: backward branches, my two best solutions are:

[18:04] <brrt> - keep a bitmap of all emitted labels, so we know which ones are backwards

[18:04] <brrt> - ensure, somehow, that the labels emitted always increase, and maintain the highest one that's recently been emitted

[18:10] <brrt> I think we're almost at the second of these options already, except that we have different classes of labels,

[23:54] <timotimo> jnthn: would it be a very bad idea to have frames share bytecode if they have the same? like the extremely common "internal error: execution of block eliminated by optimizer" one that shows up more than a thousand times in CORE.c.setting

[23:55] <timotimo> or maybe we can do something smarter with the blocks that were eliminated, that'd be better of course
