[17:20] <tib> timotimo : there is  difference but it's very small

[17:20] <tib> even by declaring inside the loop (which is maybe not sufficient to stop optims)

[17:26] <tib> Str -> Int seems to be very slow in comparison : for (1..10_000_000) { my $n ="123"; $n++; }

[18:07] <tib> timotimo : actually there is well coercion in each iteration 

[18:09] <tib> means for(1..1000) { $^item.starts-with($n) } will do 2000 calls to Str method (multi method Str(Int:D: --> Str:D) {) from src/core.c/Int.pm6 

[18:09] <tib> BUT

[18:10] <tib> for(1..1000) { $^item.starts-with($s) } will do 1000 calls to Str method (multi method Str(Int:D: --> Str:D) {) from src/core.c/Int.pm6 but also 1000 calls to Str method (multi method Str(Str:D:) { self }) from src/core.c/Str.pm6 

[18:12] <tib> so at the end both has 2000 calls but not the same methods and I think it explains the small difference I reported (like 4 or 5 seconds on 30secs when you run 100_000_000 iterations)

[18:38] <tib> (Just for precision, the other 1000 calls that never change are the coercion of $^item)
