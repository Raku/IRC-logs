[09:25] <jnthn> Hm, had. That went quickly...

[09:26] <jnthn> Is https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1334 the thing I should be looking at?

[09:28] <jnthn> Hm, the PR is YYY-A-Better-Hash; is this AAAA-A-better-hash better to run/review/test?

[09:28] <nwc10> commit 7c65ae56b76b61044951bbc432c0987ace07f0d4 has a fix for commit 073dfda3ab2c3b1c5cbe1b928202709c97a76e18

[09:28] <nwc10> and yes, totally

[09:28] <nwc10> sorry, forgot that I had not updated the PR

[09:29] <nwc10> IIRC YYY has some fixes, ZZZ is rebased onto the split flags and fixes nearly everythign else we found

[09:29] <nwc10> AAAA fixes a fatal off-by-one in uni_hash_table.c in code that isn't actually called

[09:29] <nwc10> and adds one more commit at HEAD

[09:30] <nwc10> should I kill 1334 and open 1337? :-)

[09:30] <jnthn> :D

[09:30] <jnthn> Yes, it'd be a bit easier

[09:30] <jnthn> This also deserves the number :P

[10:14] <jnthn> nwc10: It builds/tests clean here, fwiw

[10:15] *** zakharyas joined
[10:34] <nwc10> bother, I forgot to comment anywhere - there's a mention of MVM_HASH_GET in docs/extops.markdown

[10:34] <nwc10> it's clearly wrong. But I don't know if enough of that document (from 2013 or so) is useful enough to make it better to fix it

[10:34] <nwc10> or if it's so far from what we now have that it's better just to delete it and start again

[10:36] <jnthn> Or just delete it because extops are going away in hopefully not too long...

[10:37] <nwc10> well, delete it and then "never qute start again" works

[10:39] <jnthn> Indeed

[10:53] <nwc10> lunch!

[10:54] <nwc10> have I commented on everything that needed commetning on?

[10:54] <jnthn> I've just finished going through it. I mean, in only so much detail, but still...

[10:59] <jnthn> Well, my final comment is probably worth an answer (about the iter debug define)

[10:59] <jnthn> But otherwise I think all is answered

[11:24] <nwc10> is it better to go through the branch and rework history to incorporate the improvements (which makes history of the code easier to read, but somewhat confuses the history of the code review)

[11:25] <nwc10> or to stick commit(s) on the end to fix things?

[11:29] <jnthn> I prefer the latter in that it's much easier to review the fixes

[11:29] <jnthn> It'd be nice if there were a way to see what the rebased changes did (like a diff between before/after rebasing) but I ain't aware of a way to see that

[11:30] <jnthn> (Without pushing a branch name with the old thing and diffing them)

[11:30] <nwc10> diff -u <(git show $sha1) <(git show $sha2)

[11:30] <nwc10> and a lot of manual work.

[11:31] <samcv> nwc10, nice. ++ at better hash. will take a look at the MR later today

[12:00] <nwc10> actually, the *ultimate* makework version of this is

[12:00] <nwc10> 1) series of commits on the end to fix the issues

[12:00] <nwc10> 2) iterate until happy

[12:00] <nwc10> 3) snapshot that tree

[12:00] <nwc10> 4) rebuild the history with all the fixups moved into their relevant commits

[12:01] <nwc10> 5) if the end trees are identical, it's the approved code

[12:01] <nwc10> however, I am told that I need to go out this afternoon

[12:01] <nwc10> (in about 90 minutes)

[12:01] <nwc10> (and this might take longer than yesterday's trip. And involve cider)

[12:09] <jnthn> Buying or consuming? Or is that incider information?

[12:10] <nwc10> consuming. I'm the designated drinker. (And map" reader) (usually)

[12:10] <nwc10> (Except on Sunday, when suddenly it was "you're driving now")

[12:11] <nwc10> and the folks we're visiting, sadly, he's both. So can't change roles if he's the one travelling here.

[13:41] <nwc10> I think that that adresses all the current comments.

[13:42] <nwc10> but I assume that if no new ones are found, then still before merging the branch needs to be rebased, to edit out the `XXX` from that commit message

[13:43] <nwc10> (and I *think* but have not checked, that commit bafd06fafde1839ad3d529cd739c67a6e89348a0 could be folded into commit 90eb6992c03755f533b331abe810b67974068dfc

[13:43] <nwc10> (commit 90eb6992c03755f533b331abe810b67974068dfc is the one with the XXXes)

[13:44] <nwc10> still here, but likely to be AFK very soon, possibly without futher warning

[19:31] <dogbert17> any data race experts around?

[19:31] <nwc10> I wouldn't consider myself to be one.

[19:32] <dogbert17> is there a trick in figuring out if the following example points to a real problem or is it in fact a false positive?

[19:32] <dogbert17> https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/513d2932612b48730afa5fd1b102ed84

[19:32] <dogbert17> nwc10: parts of the stack trace might look familiar to you

[19:36] <nwc10> Yes, erk, but not enough that I can say *anything* useful here. Sorry

[19:36] <nwc10> I just don't know.

[19:36] <dogbert17> perhaps someone else will chime in

[19:38] <dogbert17> if I understood how to differentiate real problems from false positives I might be able to sift through the rather large amount of warnings that tsan spits out
