[14:47] <nine> Darn....I'm pretty sure that sc_idx is not correct: $4 = {sc_forward_u = {forwarder = 0xe3bc340, sc = {sc_idx = 238797632, idx = 0}, st = 0xe3bc340}, owner = 1, flags = 16, size = 48}

[14:48] <nine> 100 % reproducible, always in a call stack involving MVM_profile_heap_take_snapshot

[14:50] <jnthn> Is 0xe3bc340 valid?

[14:50] <jnthn> (as a memeory address)

[14:51] <nine> (gdb) p *c

[14:51] <nine> $7 = {sc_forward_u = {forwarder = 0xb1e2e80, sc = {sc_idx = 186527360, idx = 0}, st = 0xb1e2e80}, owner = 1, flags = 16, size = 48}

[14:51] <nine> (gdb) p *c->sc_forward_u->forwarder 

[14:51] <nine> $8 = {sc_forward_u = {forwarder = 0xb1e2eb0, sc = {sc_idx = 186527408, idx = 0}, st = 0xb1e2eb0}, owner = 1, flags = 16, size = 48}

[14:52] <nine> 0xb1e2e80 doesn't look like an STable either

[14:57] <MasterDuke> our ui64toa and i64toa are taken from https://github.com/miloyip/itoa-benchmark, but assuming our names match, there are faster versions

[14:59] <nwc10> nine: ASAN and/or valgrind don't say much/

[14:59] <nwc10> ?

[15:06] <nine> nwc10: well valgrind does report the invalid read, but at that point it's already too late

[21:55] <dogbert17> hmm, something is wrong with the heap profiler - MoarVM panic: Adding item to worklist already freed in gen2

[22:03] *** patrickb left
[23:00] <dogbert17> it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/76bde0a80c8988a699f73c3f441d9f62
