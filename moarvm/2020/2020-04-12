[13:02] <MasterDuke> but it's no longer in interp.c

[13:03] <MasterDuke> wait, it is

[13:04] <MasterDuke> huh. i must have accidentally backed out that change when looking at the blame of interp.c on github

[13:05] <nwc10> camelia++ # an excellent teddybear

[13:12] <lizmat> rubberduck?

[13:13] <lizmat> I think teddybearing has a different connotation from rubberducking ?

[13:17] <nwc10> I thought that they were the same, but maybe I'm sweet and innocent. Or just ignorant :-)

[13:25] <sena_kun> Maybe one sleeps with a plush camelia at night, we should consider this option as well. :)

[13:27] <lizmat> :-)

[13:29] <timotimo> put a camelia plushie next to your pillow when you sleep, she'll teach you raku while you dream

[13:31] <timotimo> i'm already - or still - super tired, but at least my minimal prototype of hyperop code-gen is working and is rather quick, too

[13:32] <MasterDuke> nice

[13:34] <timotimo> the code looks absolutely dreadful

[13:34] <timotimo> it's got some stuff in the wrong place, which bloated it quite a bit
