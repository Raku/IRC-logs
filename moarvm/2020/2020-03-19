[10:15] <MasterDuke> does anybody have an idea why --profile-stage=<anything> would silently not work (i.e., profiling is started, and the compilation finishes, but no profile file is written) when attempting to profile the rakudo build?

[10:16] <MasterDuke> it does work with toy examples, so it's not completely broken

[10:19] <MasterDuke> but something a little bigger than a toy example actually dies with: `===SORRY!===Profiling is already startedWriting profiler output to pc-parse.htmlSome exceptions were thrown in END blocks:  X::AdHoc: Cannot end profiling if not profiling`

[10:20] <MasterDuke> but succeeds (doesn't die and does write the file) if the BEGIN/INIT/END blocks are commented out

[10:39] <nine> MasterDuke: this is a patch I used when profiling the new MBC backend: https://gist.github.com/niner/8ebb8c6a1052a319d50f9212759d85c4

[10:40] <nine> May not fix the issue out of the box, but could give you an idea on where to look at least

[10:40] <MasterDuke> huh, thanks

[10:41] <MasterDuke> nqp: say("does this still work?")

[10:41] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: ¬´does this still work?‚ê§¬ª

[10:41] <lizmat> nine: new MBC backend ?

[10:42] <lizmat> .oO( reporter mode :-)

[10:42] <nine> I guess it's old by now :)

[10:42] <jnthn> When QAST -> MAST got rewritten to make bytes instead of a tree

[10:43] <lizmat> aaah... ok

[10:43] <jnthn> I wonder if we ever removed the tree compiler in MoarVM's sources, now it's unused

[10:43] <MasterDuke> nqp: my $a := nqp::list_i(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); my $b; my int $c := 0; my num $s := nqp::time_n(); $b := +$a while $c++ < 100_000_000; say(nqp::sub_n(nqp::time_n(), $s)); say($b)

[10:43] <nine> Yeah, src/mast is gone

[10:44] <jnthn> MasterDuke: If you make it @a instead, I think it may be smarter about that

[10:44] <MasterDuke> ^^^ the + should have been optimized into nqp::elems, right?

[10:44] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Only for +@

[10:44] <MasterDuke> nqp: my @a := nqp::list_i(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); my $b; my int $c := 0; my num $s := nqp::time_n(); $b := nqp::elems(@a) while $c++ < 100_000_000; say(nqp::sub_n(nqp::time_n(), $s)); say($b)

[10:45] <jnthn> I thought the NQP optimizer did that, anyway

[10:48] <MasterDuke> there are a lot of those in NQP, looks like maybe they aren't getting optimized like they should?

[10:51] <MasterDuke> perf shows 33% of the time spent in MVM_coerce_smart_intify for the + version

[11:15] <MasterDuke> at 100_000_000 (and same with 1 billion), https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/optimize.c#L1045-L1077 only gets called when setting MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 (but total execution time is the same)

[11:21] <MasterDuke> jnthn: why does it require MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1?

[11:22] <jnthn> No idea.

[11:23] <jnthn> I think maybe there was something with OSR not really working out in the top level of NQP programs?

[11:23] <MasterDuke> heh, that came out as a very specific/direct question

[11:23] <MasterDuke> but hm, that does ring a bell

[11:24] <MasterDuke> well, just sticking it in a sub and then calling it doesn't change anything

[11:25] <jnthn> OK, then not that. Interesting.

[13:18] <tellable6> 2020-03-10T18:47:45Z #moarvm <lizmat> brrt could you have a look at vrurg's last work, and see what would be need to get it JITted ?

[13:20] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[13:20] <brrt> I was going to ask 'what did I miss' but I've been happily reminded by a bot

[13:20] <brrt> .ask lizmat what would be vrurg's last work

[13:20] <tellable6> brrt, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[13:21] <brrt> nwc10: you can actually go outside still? :-P

[13:21] <nwc10> there is a garden

[13:21] <nwc10> and I actually went shopping yesterday

[13:22] <nwc10> Austria's current rules even permit you to go for a walk

[13:22] <nwc10> (without needing to borrow someone else's dog)

[13:23] <nwc10> of course, our "work from home" plan will be complicated by an office "move", which sort of now is "when is the VPN endpoint going down for its trip across town?"

[13:27] <brrt> oh, you're not in the UK

[13:27] <vrurg> brrt: lizmat meant https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1252 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1255. But MasterDuke has likely done what was missing in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1259
