[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 105d09d62d | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/6model/reprs/NativeCall.c

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix NativeCall libraries losing state during repossession

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Repossession of objects calls their gc_free. For NativeCall sites this

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: will lead to unloading the library. Doing so causes trouble as the

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: module may alreay have run some initialization call as is the case for

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: IO::Socket::Async::SSL. Even though we later load the library again, we

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: will run into issues.

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Better to keep libraries loaded in the very theoretical case of some

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: program only referencing a native call for a while than to run into

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: segfaults. So remove the call to MVM_nativecall_free_lib until we have a

[16:20] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: proper solution.
