[12:20] <nine> There doesn't seem to be a 2020.02.1 release on the website: http://moarvm.org/releases.html

[12:20] <nine> But NQP requires it

[12:21] <lizmat_> Altai-man_ ^^ ?

[12:21] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[12:39] <Altai-man_> nine, I can't upload it, no rights. :(

[12:40] <Altai-man_> jnthn++ has added me to moarvm organization, but it seems that moarvm.org website repo is not managed by the default team somehow.

[12:40] <nine> So why's there an nqp release requiring a MoarVM release that's not finished yet?

[12:42] <Altai-man_> nine, because I had to do the release quickly. And moarvm release is available on release page on github, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases with tarballs ready.

[12:44] <Altai-man_> the release is done and available, which is not updated is the website, because no rights. anyone with rights to commit there can update it, I'll gladly provide commit diff and the tarballs are available.

[12:45] <Altai-man_> more so, somehow I can't even create a PR to this repo. Though maybe I should just fork... Will do it right now.

[12:52] <Altai-man_> accepting https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/pull/11 should fix this case.
