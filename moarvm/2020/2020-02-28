[20:17] <timotimo> how y'all holding up regarding the covid19 thing?

[20:30] <brrt> \o

[20:30] <tellable6> 2020-02-24T22:12:02Z #moarvm <MasterDuke> brrt: how would we create templates for a lot of the sp_* ops? the interp code and lego jitted versions have loops in them

[20:30] <brrt> wait, loops

[20:31] <brrt> .tell MasterDuke the sp_getlex / sp_bindlex set, they'll need some special handling, but I don't see that as a big deal

[20:31] <tellable6> brrt, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[20:31] <brrt> i've learned to be tolerant over things that don't fit...

[20:41] <timotimo> today when i went grocery shopping, i couldn't help but notice there not being as much tinned food any more

[20:45] <brrt> oh boy

[20:47] <brrt> yeah, I'm mostly ignoring it as well

[20:47] <timotimo> i've never seen this in my life, so it's a little surreal

[20:55] <brrt> realistically, isn't... the cat out of the bag by now?

[20:55] <brrt> as in, we're pretty much all going to get it sooner or later?

[20:55] <timotimo> you mean like there's nothing we can do now to ... mhh

[20:58] <brrt> efforts to contain the spread have been both hysteric and ineffective

[20:58] <leont> All? Not likely. Many? Probablyâ€¦

[21:01] <timotimo> i hear there's loads of people wearing paper masks hoping to prevent getting infected

[21:01] <timotimo> which is ... sad

[21:01] <brrt> leont: maybe not this year... but I imagine we're going to see 95% prevalence in a decade, certainly

[21:02] <brrt> we have time.

[21:41] <timotimo> you think this specific virus will stick around that long?

[21:46] <dogbert17> timotimo: were you after tinned food when you went out shopping?

[21:48] <MasterDuke> timotimo: did you see my question last night?

[21:48] <tellable6> 2020-02-28T20:31:42Z #moarvm <brrt> MasterDuke the sp_getlex / sp_bindlex set, they'll need some special handling, but I don't see that as a big deal

[21:50] <MasterDuke> brrt: what sort of special handling? for some ops before we've just moved the code in interp.c into a function and called that, don't know if that's a viable option here

[21:50] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to brrt

[22:00] <timotimo> MasterDuke:yeah, i think we'll want to zero-initialize the variable and memcpy instead of strncpy

[22:03] <MasterDuke> or just strncpy 7 instead of 8 and manually stick a '\0' at the end?

[22:03] <timotimo> it's not supposed to have a 0 at the end

[22:03] <timotimo> if it's 8 letters it's supposed to end in a letter

[22:04] <timotimo> so str* functions are just not the right choice

[22:04] <MasterDuke> ah

[22:13] <timotimo> i'm getting some flu symptoms; hoping it's just nocebo
