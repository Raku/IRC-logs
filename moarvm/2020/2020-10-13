[19:15] <nwc10> I'm listenig to "The Music Makers" by Edward Elgar, which is the words from "Ode" by Arthur O'Shaughnessy

[19:15] <nwc10> and I've just noticed that it has "And out of the infinite morning"

[19:15] <nwc10> which seems on topic

[19:15] <nwc10>        morning"

[19:15] <nwc10> argh

[19:16] <nwc10> https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54933/ode- -- penultimate verse

[19:18] <Altai-man> nwc10, not sure if I follow and write anything relevant, but Elgar is very cool IMO. His cello concerto is just wow.
