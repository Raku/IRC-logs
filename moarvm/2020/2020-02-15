[14:49] <patrickb> o/

[14:49] <patrickb> My MoarVM has started failing to build on Windows with "bigintops.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mp_set_double". Any ideas what might be wrong?

[14:50] <timotimo> is your libtommath out of date?

[14:50] <timotimo> "git submodule sync" maybe?

[14:51] <patrickb> git status shows no difference

[14:53] <patrickb> the latest commit in the libtommath submodule looks related: https://github.com/MoarVM/libtommath/commit/db0d387b808d557bd408a6a253c5bf3a688ef274

[14:56] <patrickb> I actually get the "mp_set_double implementation is only available on platforms with IEEE754 floating point format" warning message during build.

[14:58] <timotimo> interesting, what kind of machine are you building on?

[14:58] <patrickb> x86_64, Windows 10

[14:59] <patrickb> latest visual studio

[15:01] <patrickb> If I read the #if in bn_mp_set_double.c correctly the problem is that the VS c compiler defines none of the given variables.

[15:03] <patrickb> This is opposite to any documentation I just found on what variables the compiler defines on my platform.

[15:05] * patrickb checks if a MSVC update is available

[15:09] <patrickb> No updates. Argh!

[15:12] <patrickb> appveyor is happy. So it has to be a local problem.
