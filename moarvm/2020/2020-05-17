[17:12] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Is there anything to look out for when doing a libtommath bump? I'd like to get https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1279 fixed.

[17:14] <sena_kun> patrickb, it must support musl. :D

[17:15] <MasterDuke> patrickb: we have two commits on top of v1.2.0 that probably need to be brought along

[17:16] <MasterDuke> i don't think they have a new release, that commit was just to their develop branch

[17:16] <MasterDuke> so we could just cherry-pick it

[17:18] <patrickb> MasterDuke: So cherry pick + push to MoarVM/libtommath and then a bump of the submodule should be fine?

[18:04] <MasterDuke> pretty much. fyi, i think we're technically on a branch i created off of the upstream v1.2.0 tag (and then added some commits to), so maybe it makes sense to stay on that branch
