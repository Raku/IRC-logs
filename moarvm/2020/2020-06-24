[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Explicitly state we use gnu99 on GCC

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This fixes building on older versions of GCC (< 5.0) that default to gnu89.

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Using `-std=c99` instead of `-std=gnu99` breaks the build of libuv because

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: some pthread declarations are then left out. So it seems sensible to go

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: with the GCC default of using the `gnu99` variant instead of the `c99`

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: variant.

[11:23] <lizmat> I guess we need a bump now?

[11:23] <Altai-man_> lizmat, can try to see if the issue resolved.

[12:30] <nwc10> good *, brrt 

[12:30] <nwc10> good *, dogbert17

[12:31] <dogbert17> hello nwc10, what's the state of your beer fridge?

[12:32] * dogbert17 temperature is slowly creeping towards 30 degrees centigrade here

[12:33] * dogbert17 could use a beer but don't have any atm :(

[12:33] *** timotimo left
[12:35] *** timotimo joined
[12:35] <nwc10> it has beer. Although I realised last night that most of the beer was in the crate near it, and not enough in the fridge itself

[12:36] <timotimo> hewwo bwwt

[12:36] <dogbert17> so it's not very cold then :)

[12:36] <dogbert17> hello timotimo

[12:36] <timotimo> temperature is like 28 centigrade, will be 30 the next two days

[12:38] <dogbert17> Yeah, just picked up a cheap fan which I can use if things get out of hand

[12:40] <dogbert17> my apartment is on the top floor and can get uncomfartably hot during the summer

[12:40] <timotimo> oh no

[12:40] <timotimo> top floor is terrible

[12:40] <dogbert17> almost 30 degrees inside atm

[12:40] <timotimo> disgusting

[12:40] <dogbert17> yes indeed

[12:40] <timotimo> i am maybe too sensitive to heat, but damn, it just kills me

[12:41] <dogbert17> I don't like it either

[12:42] <dogbert17> I mean what's wrong with say 22-24 degrees 

[12:44] <timotimo> aye

[12:50] <brrt> hi nwc10, dogbeter, timotimo 

[12:50] <brrt> *dogbert17

[12:55] <dogbert17> brrt, is it extremely hot where you live as well today?

[12:57] <dogbert17> lizmat: stresstest looks fine

[17:27] <brrt> dogbert17: it's nearly 30 degrees C, which is warm, but not nearly as warm as last year

[19:02] <brrt> on the topic of bombshells.... https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-perl-7/

[19:05] <[Coke]> I don't know about "bombshell", I mean we pretty much set them up for that.

[19:05] <[Coke]> ... that said, first I heard was post-sawyer presention

[19:07] <brrt> hehe true

[19:08] <brrt> I read it and I *think* it is all sane and good

[19:08] <brrt> preferable to sticking with perl5.xxxxx

[19:08] <nwc10> it was a very well kept secret. In that, it remained an unknown unknown

[20:21] <timotimo> i wonder what the next step for the jit currently is

[20:22] <nwc10> ARM. Ready for next year's macs?

[20:23] <nwc10> <ducks>

[20:24] <jnthn> Teach the expression JIT about dispatch :P

[20:29] *** sivoais left
[20:40] <timotimo> wouldn't spesh be code-genning most stuff so the jit would just see guards and simple ops?

[20:41] *** sivoais joined
[20:42] *** MasterDuke joined
[20:42] <jnthn> Only in the case the callsite was linked...

[20:42] <jnthn> Or rewritable

[20:43] <jnthn> Dunno if we'll have some that ain't

[20:43] <jnthn> (other than unlinked, of course)

[20:43] <jnthn> That said, one option for handling a dispatch that was never linked is to always turn it into a deopt

[20:43] <jnthn> That way, you get rid of unreachable codepaths

[20:43] <jnthn> uh, unreached

[20:51] <timotimo> so we cut every instruction after the unconditional deopt and end up with a shorter frame instead?

[21:01] <jnthn> Yeah
