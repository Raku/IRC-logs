[19:46] <nine> Kaiepi: I have no intuition how that change will affect things :/

[19:52] <Kaiepi> nine, on my machine libuv headers from /usr/local/include can override the ones from 3rdparty with the original order, which screws up builds since openbsd's libuv package is fairly old

[19:53] <Kaiepi> idt it'd affect much otherwise, but the build scripts aren't something i've messed with too much

[19:57] <Kaiepi> fwiw i've had to move the /usr/include includes like this for a while now, and haven't encountered any issues

[19:57] <nine> Kaiepi: I understand your problem and the patch looks like it will solve it. But I have no idea about whether this could cause issues elsewhere

[20:05] <Kaiepi> ah

[20:05] <Kaiepi> yeah that i can't predict

[20:06] *** zakharyas joined
[20:09] <nine> That's the trouble will all the build system things :/
