[09:00] <MasterDuke> how do we want to handle aborts from gmp? (try to) detect the potential error conditions before calling the gmp function? trap any errors?

[09:01] <nwc10> how does it abort? call abort()?

[09:02] <MasterDuke> well, i don't think it's any one thing. sometimes it's floating point exceptions, sometimes divide by 0, no mem available

[09:03] <nwc10> er, erk.

[09:04] <nwc10> OK, I don't know. But if it's being called from gcc as part of an optimiser, surely that has to handle all this reliably. So how does it avoid crapping out, and instead returning useful messages?

[09:04] <nwc10> I really don't know. It's sounding like "doctor doctor, it hurts when I do this" "Well, don't do that then"

[09:05] <nwc10> as in - it sounds like we don't want to even call it if we know that it's going to bomb out

[09:05] <nwc10> but I don't know whehter all the cases can be spotted before it's called.

[09:05] <nwc10> I've not even looked into this code

[09:08] <MasterDuke> you've not looked at the moarvm code that calls the gmp functions? or the gmp implementation?

[09:17] <nwc10> neither part

[09:19] <MasterDuke> https://gmplib.org/repo/gmp/file/tip/errno.c#l44

[09:22] <nwc10> oh my. For that I trade you this: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/37327

[09:22] <nwc10> which looks kind of bonkers

[09:23] <nwc10> but seems to start to answer "how does Julia do it"?

[12:51] <MasterDuke> nine: thanks, i'll give that a try

[12:54] <nine> Huh.... the GMP docs tell you to use MPFR instead in new projects. And MPFR actually documents how to handle exceptions: https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Exceptions
