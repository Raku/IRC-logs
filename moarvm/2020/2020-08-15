[14:17] <dogbert11> not much going on here it seems, could it be the heat?

[14:47] <lizmat> dogbert11: that'd be one thing

[14:47] <lizmat> people being busy with other stuff because of having been on holiday / going to be on holiday

[14:47] <lizmat> may be another

[14:52] <dogbert11> lizmat: it's 29 degrees where I'm at and it's a bit too much for me

[14:52] <lizmat> inside or outside ?  :-)

[14:52] <lizmat> 25.6 here, inside  :-)

[14:55] <dogbert11> same temp both inside and outside :(

[15:00] <lizmat> ah, outside it's still a bit hotter here, 29 or so

[15:01] <dogbert11> guess you're staying inside until it cools down a bit then

[15:02] <lizmat> yeah... although the heat of my notebook is pushing me out already  :-)

[15:02] <lizmat> spectests don't help in these circumstances  :-)

[15:42] <dogbert11> I can imagine :-)

[18:09] <dogbert11> are messages like this suspect or totally ok?

[18:09] <dogbert11> Thread 6 pushed to an object (NQPArray) allocated by thread 3

[19:16] <MasterDuke> without being 100% sure i would think that's ok. the gc could cause things to move between threads, right?

[19:48] <nine> No, the owner of an object will stay the same

[19:49] <nine> It's not a sign that something goes wrong. It may help finding unsafe threading code but I'd consider it a weak indication only (without having looked at the actual code)

[20:34] *** zakharyas left
[20:35] <dogbert11> nine, MasterDuke: it's the output from: MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG=1  MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 ./perl6-m -e "await (^250).map({ start { EVAL '/0|1|2/' } }); say 'ok'" 

[20:38] <dogbert11> the code has just failed with a random error message in this case: ===SORRY!=== Local '__lowered_param__82' already declared

[20:40] <dogbert11> I took the code snippet from https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/4507
