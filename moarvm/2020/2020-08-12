[08:17] <nwc10> Oh the awesome. This is building with clang on a Raspberry Pi:

[08:17] <nwc10> oh, thanks irssi

[08:17] <nwc10> anyway, build fail due to an illegal instruction

[08:17] <nwc10> whereas gcc works

[08:17] <nwc10> [Coke]: what clang version does your machine have? :-)

[08:18] <nwc10> and did you run the NQP tests? :-)

[11:51] <nwc10> jnthn: this pig is almost airworthy

[11:52] <nwc10> [Coke]: that should fix the bugs you found

[11:52] <nwc10> dogbert17: that should avoid the aliasing warning. Which happened to appear on a line that was not changed

[11:52] <nwc10> it's rebased onto split-flags so

[11:52] <nwc10> 1) it should avoid that race

[11:53] <nwc10> 2) it needs the split-flags branch (ie commit) for rakudo - see https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1336

[11:53] <nwc10> jnthn: in particular, could you look at the commit that starts XXX, as that has some possivly "brave" assumptions.

[11:58] <nwc10> and now I am required to be "AFK"

[11:58] <nwc10> although this time, probably "we" have not just SMS, but even data!

[15:47] <timotimo> lightning storm in here

[15:47] <jnthn> Ooh, we had our one of those earlier in the week. It was very loud.

[15:48] <timotimo> this was not very loud, but very rainy and very windy

[15:48] <jnthn> nwc10: I didn't get to look over the commit yet; lots of $dayjob bits

[15:48] <nwc10> :-(

[15:48] <jnthn> Though I've got tomorrow set aside for Raku/MoarVM things

[15:48] <nwc10> ah OK cool.

[15:49] <nwc10> although @other can probably look at #1336 and see if *it* is sane. (er, possibly one $other)

[15:51] <timotimo> should i checkout and build zzz and test it for stuff?

[15:52] <nwc10> timotimo: if you could, that would be wonderful. It needs the raudo branch (as detailed in PR #1336)

[15:52] <timotimo> yeah, the one that switches the flags into two bits

[15:52] <nwc10> in particular, could you check that I didn't somehow screw up the heap profiler or the debug server?

[15:53] <timotimo> i can try!

[15:53] <nwc10> they compile (ship it!) but I don't know if

[15:53] <nwc10> a) they still work

[15:53] <nwc10> b) they actually worked on master before I started :-/

[15:55] <nwc10> what comes after Z? :-)

[16:04] <nwc10> odd, I seem to have lost a commit that added a hash size to MVM_str_hash_build()

[16:04] <timotimo> what does the reflog say?

[16:05] <nwc10> I've found it in XXX-A-Better-Hash

[16:05] <nwc10> I've sort of lost count of how many checkout I have across how many machines.

[16:12] <timotimo> forgot to put "install" after make

[17:46] <nwc10> that's the "missing" commit.

[17:57] <timotimo> it's too warm

[18:11] <[Coke]> nwc10: didn't run nqp tests, went straight to rakudo. one moment

[18:11] <[Coke]> nwc10: Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)

[18:11] <[Coke]> ... switching to ZZZ, trying again.

[18:14] *** Altai-man joined
[18:16] <[Coke]> nqp tests all pass in zzz

[18:16] <[Coke]> rakudo build fails, however.

[18:16] *** sena_kun left
[18:17] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/89ff8592af70ce91b38bdfe74ac55c67

[18:17] <[Coke]> dies in the c code for nqp ops.

[18:18] <[Coke]> looks like we need to track the flags -> flags1/2 change.

[18:19] <[Coke]> I'm using rakudo:master, maybe I need a branch?

[18:19] <[Coke]> (also using nqp:master)

[18:20] *** AlexDaniel` left
[18:27] *** AlexDaniel` joined
[18:32] <timotimo> there's a branch in nwc's personal clone

[18:32] <timotimo> but it's just a tiny patch

[18:32] <[Coke]> is it all "flags1"?

[18:33] <timotimo> +#ifdef MVM_COLLECTABLE_FLAGS1

[18:33] <timotimo> +#define RAKUDO_FIRST_FLAG 128

[18:33] <timotimo> +#else

[18:33] <timotimo>  #define RAKUDO_FIRST_FLAG 16384

[18:33] <timotimo> +#endif

[18:33] <timotimo> this as well

[18:37] <[Coke]> added his fork as a remote, building...

[18:37] <[Coke]> (git++)

[18:41] <nwc10> [Coke]: the newest clang I could find was clang version 7.0.1-8 (tags/RELEASE_701/final)

[18:41] <nwc10> earlier clang doesnb't optimise hard enough to expose my bug

[18:52] <[Coke]> ok. the current build with ZZZ/nqp/your fork, all tests pass in nqp/rakudo!

[18:52] <nwc10> \o/

[18:52] <nwc10> ship it! oh, wait, still some XXXes to review

[18:52] <nwc10> I'm very glad that you exposed that bug.

[18:53] <nwc10> thanks for testing (twice)

[19:00] <[Coke]> literally the least I could do. :)

[19:00] <[Coke]> (i mean, and still do something)

[19:01] <nwc10> true, *but* you were diligent at repeating that it was still broken. and you happen to have a platform (that I don't) that tests both a different OS and a compiler that I forgot about.

[19:01] <[Coke]> (y)

[19:01] <[Coke]> (which is apparently MS/Skype shorthand for "thumbs up"

[19:02] <[Coke]> üëç

[19:02] <[Coke]> so I'll just do that, then. :)
