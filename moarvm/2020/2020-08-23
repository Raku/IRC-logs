[07:28] <MasterDuke> jnthn: so iiuc, spesh has made a type specialization based on Iterator, because that's all it's seen (the 458 times)? then we hit that code path 740k times with not-Iterator, but spesh currently doesn't have a way of backing out and redoing an optimization, so instead we get all the deopts?

[07:28] *** dogbert11 joined
[07:29] <MasterDuke> btw, how in the world does this happen 740k times? the range/array that's generated is only 702 elem

[08:53] <MasterDuke> well, the profile does show 740k calls to reify-at-least. seems sub-optimal

[08:53] <MasterDuke> lizmat: ^^^ an optimization opportunity?

[08:56] <lizmat> MasterDuke: be my guest  :-)

[09:00] <MasterDuke> AT_POS_SLOW is called 702 times (that makes sense), and it calls reify-at-least 701 times. so where do all the rest come from?

[09:04] <MasterDuke> pull-one https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/List.pm6#L611

[09:31] <timotimo> are there OSR hits?

[10:53] <timotimo> o/

[11:04] <brrt> it's.. sunday :-)

[11:06] <timotimo> why?

[11:08] <brrt> well, that's just by convention, really

[11:08] <timotimo> i should inspect the logs to find out what's going on

[11:15] <brrt> lol

[11:16] <brrt> timotimo: I have a... theory, or thesis, or whatever, some thing I want to write about the nature of 'scripting'

[11:16] <brrt> do you think that makes sense to write about and publish, or should I stick to technical topics only?

[11:27] <timotimo> totally fine to write and publish, in my opinion

[12:02] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any other thoughts re this weird [*] behavior?

[12:02] <timotimo> haven't looked much closer yet, sorry

[20:36] <MasterDuke> huh. moarperf isn't working after rebuilding moarvm/nqp/rakudo

[20:37] <MasterDuke> Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp' (from 'site#sources/C223DF36B97268CA54BFBCF1C7C6BCDB9B0B32EA (Crypt::Random)')at /home/dan/Source/perl6/tools/moarperf/site#sources/B62C5FE5D305B25CDC0F9CF50225CFD154917AA7 (Cro::HTTP::Router::WebSocket):6

[20:47] <MasterDuke> deleting moarperf/lib/.precomp fixed it
