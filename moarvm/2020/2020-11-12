[07:01] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[08:07] <timotimo> trying 

[08:10] <timotimo> to find my desktop's ipv6 address

[08:10] <timotimo> nmapped for hours and hours

[08:10] *** sena_kun joined
[08:12] *** Altai-man left
[08:13] <nine> Have you tried arp -a?

[08:14] <nwc10> :-) That was my standard way to find my work desktop (from a machine with a fixed name and IP)

[08:16] <nine> And maybe a ping to the link local multi cast address works: FF02::1

[08:17] *** domidumont joined
[08:17] <nwc10> oh, I forgot. I cheated - I knew the MAC address of the machine.

[08:17] <nwc10> this helps a lot

[08:19] <nine> Yes, ping does indeed work, but it needs the interface specified explicitly: ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1

[08:28] <timotimo> arp -a only gives you ipv4 addresses :)

[08:28] <timotimo> netsh interface neighbors or something will give you a similar thing

[08:29] <timotimo> but i didn't see my machine in there

[08:30] <timotimo> oh no

[08:30] <timotimo> i'm a total idiot

[08:30] <timotimo> i wasn't even nmapping the right prefix

[08:30] <nwc10> use more 'coffee'; ?

[08:31] <timotimo> i went all the way from ::0 to ::b:2fff

[20:09] <nwc10> do the docs for libtomath exist anywhere online, or did I *have* to build them locally?

[20:10] <nwc10> (which eventually worked, but on the second machine I tried on, and somewhat (first ever) LTA - the crazy thing *rewrites* files under version control during the docs build)

[20:12] <[Coke]> O_o;

[21:10] <MasterDuke> nwc10: what are you doing with libtommath? i haven't heard back yet from my email to the gmp mailing list about the linking problem, but hopefully once that's resolved we can switch over

[21:10] <nwc10> I'm trying to work out why one spectest fails on 32 bit systems

[21:11] <nwc10> and it's something to do with commit b735866ddee9bd719440e5c822045430b335f27b

[21:11] <nwc10> which fixes other bugs

[21:11] <nwc10> and "32 bit systems" is certainly x86, ARM and ppc32

[21:11] <nwc10> I think it was also sparc32, but it took quite a bit of hacking to get sparc32 to build, and I don't have that set up currently

[21:13] <MasterDuke> ah. well if you've got gobs and gobs of spare time, you could try my gmp branch on those systems and see if it works/changes anything

[21:15] <MasterDuke> oh, don't think i've PRed it, so it probably only exists in my fork
