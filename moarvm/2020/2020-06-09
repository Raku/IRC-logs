[10:09] <MasterDuke> jnthn: if you've got a couple spare minutes sometime (hopefully today) i'd appreciate a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1308

[10:09] <nwc10> could someone who knows how to test the debugserver have a look at the first commit of my pull request (#1307) and if that one is good, merge that one? The other two are (I feel) "contraversial" but the first removes a bunch of inefficiencies

[10:10] <MasterDuke> the nqp and rakudo builds are currently a bit panicky and that fixes it, but confirmation that it's correct and complete would be good

[10:11] <nwc10> jnthn: you're popular :-)

[10:11] <MasterDuke> that's the problem with being good at your job

[11:24] <MasterDuke> brrt: ahoy. btw, there have been a couple questions recently about what it would take to support the jit on arm. is it tricky work? or relatively straightforward grunt work? any difference if it's just AArch64?

[11:25] <brrt> MasterDuke: I'd think there would be a good part messy work involved

[11:25] <brrt> I think it ought to be possible but not necessarily easy

[11:25] <brrt> especially the 'legacy' JIT is very heavy on x86-isms

[11:25] <MasterDuke> ok, good to know

[11:36] <lizmat> brrt so would it make sense to start a different JIT effort for ARM >

[11:36] <lizmat> ?

[11:37] *** sena_kun joined
[11:39] <brrt> not sure I'd say that either

[11:39] *** Altai-man_ left
[11:39] <lizmat> well, with the next gen of Apple hardware being ARM again... I'd hate to have to run Raku on that without JIT  :-)

[11:40] <brrt> lizmat: on a pure technical ground, I think somebody (me?) should probably fix the legacy JIT not to suck, or to be removed altogether

[11:40] <brrt> On the other hand, that someone should probably have possession of a good ARM hackmachine, and since I'm not buying apple... :-P

[11:40] <timotimo> lazy initialization of lookup hashes in static frames sounds like something we'd want to either lock or make access atomic for

[11:41] <lizmat> hehe... well, I don't have an ARM either

[11:41] <lizmat> and for me personally, I doubt that my next notebook will be an Apple, as Catalina managed to completely mess up just about all of my private media workflows

[11:43] <brrt> I'm far too satisfied with my linux thinkpad

[11:45] <brrt> Ironically I got myself 32gb to be able to use gradle+intellij... now I still have to use gradle but rarely use intellij, so I hardly ever use that much memory

[11:50] <timotimo> any additional ram makes the disk faster, though i assume you have an SSD which is already pretty fast even with cold caches

[11:52] <brrt> It came with an NVMe which has windows on it, and I placed an SSD into the expansion slot

[11:52] <brrt> on which I installed fedora

[12:01] <xiaomiao> pro tip: swap on nvme is fast enough

[12:01] <brrt> yeah, but it still has windows on there

[12:02] <brrt> which is handy in a pinch

[12:02] <xiaomiao> put the windows in a VM ;)

[12:03] <brrt> could, but won't :-)

[12:05] <xiaomiao> me neither, waste of diskspace

[12:05] <xiaomiao> the "windows 10" tech demo my thinkpad came with still needs a few years of development before it's useful

[12:06] <jnthn> brrt: I figure, so far as the JIT goes, transitioning completely to using the expr JIT would make things easier so far as porting goes?

[12:07] <brrt> jnthn: yes; which, unfortunately, means that someone needs to hacking work to make the expression JIT more complete still

[12:07] <brrt> of which I have a bunch of half-finished branches

[12:10] <jnthn> brrt: I guess the good news is that dispatch is going to get a bit more regular... :)

[12:12] <brrt> I think I saw bits and pieces there

[12:12] <brrt> :-)

[12:38] <nine> MasterDuke: I think with timotimo++'s insight into spesh facts, we can merge your GC fixing PR in good conscience.

[12:39] <MasterDuke> cool. then i'll do that now and bump nqp+rakudo

[13:51] <brrt> dubitable new achievement in my motoring carreer; I had to jump-start my car

[13:51] <brrt> note to anyone trying this, make sure that the cables you use are rated for a decent amount of amperes

[13:52] <brrt> without this it doesn't work as well

[13:53] <MasterDuke> yeah. i helped a friend jump his car about a year ago. absolutely nothing happened at all with his cables. tried mine, which were a bit more substantial, and it started right up on the first attempt

[13:55] <brrt> hehe... I used the cables from my solar installations... it ultimately did work
