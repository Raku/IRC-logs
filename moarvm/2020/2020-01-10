[16:15] <MasterDuke> ok, i've a fix for the issue in MVM_bigint_pow. but now i'm seeing a problem in MVM_bigint_exptmod, though the problem is not with exptmod itself, but that boxed values are persisting

[16:17] <MasterDuke> the test is `my $r := nqp::pow_I(box(2), box(-3), $n_type, $bi_type); ok(nqp::iseq_n($r, 0.125) && nqp::istype($r, $n_type), 'pow 2 ** -3');`, but in MVM_bigint_exptmod the values are 42 and -42 (not 2 and -3)

[16:18] <MasterDuke> running just that line by itself works fine, but when running the whole test file i get the problem. so somewhere i messed something up in my changes to the functions used during boxing

[16:18] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1221 if anybody wants to take a look

[16:31] *** zakharyas left
[16:33] <MasterDuke> hm, i may be mistaken as to what's wrong...

[17:00] <MasterDuke> heh, yeah, i was way off
