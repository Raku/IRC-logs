[09:33] <MasterDuke> libuv 1.40.0 is already out, looks like a 1.41.0 or 1.40.1 might be out soon. we should bump after the release

[10:31] <jnthn> nine: Convenient :)

[11:16] <MasterDuke> ok, i'm back with some time to try to debug that segv i'd captured in rr

[11:16] <MasterDuke> but where was i?

[11:17] <MasterDuke> 13:51 	nine 	I'd say you want to know where it entered the worklist13:52 	nine 	You already know where and how sc_idx gets overwritten. That didn't help because it's obviously not the writer's fault. It's the fault of whoever holds a pointer to an object and lets it get out-dated

[11:26] <MasterDuke> hm. guess i want to set a breakpoint on MVM_gc_worklist_add where `item` is the same `item` that causes the panic in MVM_gc_mark_collectable?

[14:02] <MasterDuke> see the address in MVM_gc_mark_collectable when the panic happens, set a watchpoint on it, reverse-cont, see when that address gets written, see what the previous address was, set a watchpoint on MVM_gc_watchlist_add when the address of it's argument is the same, reverse-cont again, when that hits see where we are?

[15:17] <nwc10> I don't know the answer, but I assume that the MoarVM code is portable enough (along with all the *other* 3rd party stuff) that the limiting factor will be libuv. So the answer likely is "the same as UV supports"

[15:18] <Kaeipi> ah

[15:19] <nwc10> I really don't know - and I'm not personalyl in a posisiton to try it out

[15:19] <nwc10> I think that jnthn was developing partly on Windows 7 until relatively recently, so it's possible that Windows 7 still builds too

[15:21] <jnthn> Yeah, 7 is what I still have here

[15:21] <nine> Windows 8.1 fell out of mainstream support in 2018 and will fall out of extended support in January 2023

[15:21] <jnthn> Though I don't develop on it much (pretty much only if I'm asked to go after a bug)

[15:23] <nwc10> here's an answer: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/master/SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.md

[15:23] <jnthn> nine: What's supported and what's used are different questions, alas :)

[15:26] <nwc10> the door system at the old office was still running on Windows 2000 until a couple of years ago.

[15:26] <nwc10> The system that replaced it was on Windows 7, IIRC

[15:26] <nwc10> "thanks dudes. This product you're installing will itself go out of support in 2 years"

[15:32] <MasterDuke> given the warning in this comment https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blame/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L2482-L2489 has the serialization format changed at all recently?

[15:37] <[Coke]> I do very occassional builds on win 10, haven't had any issues when tried.

[16:09] <MasterDuke> i've seen some functions from that file in backtraces during my flailing about in rr

[16:09] <MasterDuke> and then the comments here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blame/master/src/6model/serialization.c#L2544-L2545 gave me pause

[16:32] <nwc10> well, that IIRC the lazy function was trying to figure out if all the things "inside" something else where of the shapes that it expected, and if it was 100% confident about what was inside, it was lazy (ie cheated), else it was eager

[16:33] <nwc10> but please don't ask me to expand anything in that sentance, because I can't remember any more than that, and my head is currently full of many many other things.

[19:25] <nwc10> Unlike that Pascal quote apologising for writing a long letter, in this case, I don't think that I could write a shorter explanation of the problem, and the not-a-solutions.

[19:41] <nwc10> lizmat: is there a (booby) prize for the longest commit message?

[19:41] <lizmat> good question  :-)

[20:00] *** domidumont left
[20:06] <nine> And is there also a price for longest commit message per actual character changed? I may be a contestant for that :)

[20:07] <nwc10> I sometimes do quite well on those.

[20:07] <nwc10> on that metric, that is

[20:07] <nwc10> you can make a 1 character change

[20:07] <nwc10> and then a long explanation of why

[20:07] <nwc10> (justified explanation)

[20:07] <nwc10> meanwhile I must berate the beer fridge operative, as he (it is known to be a he) failed to put in the beer that I actually wanted

[20:08] <nwc10> I have fixed this, and taken a different one (for now)

[20:10] *** Altai-man joined
[20:12] <MasterDuke> nwc10: could there possibly be a missing MVMROOT in (or around) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blame/master/src/6model/reprs/MVMHash.c#L97-L119 ?

[20:13] *** sena_kun left
[20:20] <nwc10> I didn't think that anything that it calls down to can cause the GC to run, because nothing (I thought) does any object allocation

[20:21] <nwc10> that's not "no" just "if there is one missing, I can't see why"

[20:21] <MasterDuke> ok, that's kind of where i ended up too, but wanted a second opinion

[20:22] <nwc10> "it got past code review - it must be perfect"

[20:22] <nwc10> or

[20:22] <nwc10> "it got past code review - it's SEP now :-)"

[20:24] <nwc10> aargh, I'm getting flashbacks to pow(2, 32) being an odd number on Irix

[20:25] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/a175cb379647619b1ac9c2bef9671069 does this look like i've done something wrong with the breakpoint? or is it correct and the idx is really that crazy number?

[20:25] <nwc10> I hope that that other beer is cold (enough)

[20:27] <MasterDuke> i recently got two christmas beers, one st bernardus and one delirium tremens. looking forward to the end of lockdown to try with with a friend of mine

[20:27] <nine> MasterDuke: that's 2^32-1 which is MVM_DIRECT_SC_IDX_SENTINEL

[20:27] <MasterDuke> ah

[20:33] <MasterDuke> gist updated. is this where the problem object gets added to the worklist?

[20:34] <nine> what did you set the watchpoint on?

[20:36] <MasterDuke> iirc, i first went forward to the panic, then found the address of new_addr in MVM_gc_mark_collectable, then went back to the beginning and set the read watchpoint on that

[20:38] <nine> Oh a read watchpoint. Not a bad idea. I'd have watched the slot in the worklist. But yes, I'd say you're in the right place

[20:38] <nine> now you can trace that pointer's origin further back

[20:38] <MasterDuke> heh, well it wasn't the hash bind...

[20:39] <nine> And somewhere along the line there's the spot where it should be rooted but isn't. But only reading the code will tell you which one

[20:39] <MasterDuke> and it wasn't the clone

[20:39] <nine> It's unlikely to be some very common operation like hash binds. We'd be crashing all over the place

[20:40] <MasterDuke> seems unlikely to be in decont either

[20:41] <nine> I'm a bit confused why GC_DEBUG=3 didn't make it easier to spot, since that includes poisoning which would trip up every of those ops. But maybe the frequent GC runs would promote it to gen2 too quickly

[20:43] <MasterDuke> or find_meth...

[21:16] *** zakharyas joined
[21:31] <MasterDuke> if something calls MVM_gc_allocate_gen2_default_set(tc), then we don't need to worry about MVMROOTing?

[21:39] <jnthn> Correct, because it can't trigger GC

[21:40] <MasterDuke> thanks

[21:44] <MasterDuke> re "But maybe the frequent GC runs would promote it to gen2 too quickly", is there a way to disable the gen2 promotion?

[21:48] *** zakharyas left
[21:56] <jnthn> Make the nursery bigger

[21:56] <jnthn> That won't disable it, but it'll put it off much longer
