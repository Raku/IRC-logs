[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: In struct MVMDLLRegistry, `name` is never read or used after assignment.

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5d98d8eb6e

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 12c7a44a85 | (Nicholas Clark)++ | src/spesh/frame_walker.c

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: In MVMLexicalRegistry, `lexreg[i]->value` is always `i`.

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: The value *is* the index in the array - it's used to find the correct array

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: index when doing a hash lookup by name. Hence use the `i` directly,

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: avoiding a dereference.

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This code was initially in src/6model/reprs/MVMIter.c, added in Oct 2015

[13:44] <nwc10> jnthn: MVM_exception_throw_adhoc doesn't release mutexes, does it?

[13:48] <nwc10> ^^ good *, #moarvm 

[13:50] <lizmat> nwc10 o/

[13:50] <nwc10> \o

[13:50] <nwc10> It's raining. The poor garden will have to survive without me. :-)

[14:03] <nine> nwc10: no it doesn't

[14:03] <moritz> we had some really impressive thunderstorm with heavy rains yesterday

[14:03] <nine> release mutexes....rain is a fact today

[14:04] <moritz> I stood by the window for a quarter hour and just observed the lightnings -- sometimes 3-4 in a single second

[14:05] <nwc10> I've only noticed one

[14:05] <nwc10> and the rain arrived this afternoon - I was expecting it this morning

[14:07] <nwc10> moritz: yesterday, we had sun. Lots of it

[14:07] <moritz> us too... thunderstorm started after sunset

[14:08] <lizmat> only 30kms away, streets were flooded this morning

[14:08] <lizmat> we hardly got a drop here

[14:08] <lizmat> heavy showers hardly moving

[14:35] <timotimo> we do have an infrastructure for registering mutexes to be released by exception throwing, don't we?

[14:37] <nine> Yes: MVM_tc_set_ex_release_mutex and MVM_tc_set_ex_release_atomic

[16:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: find_repr_by_name must hold mutex_repr_registry when reading repr_hash.

[16:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[16:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MVM_repr_register_dynamic_repr locks mutex_repr_registry before reading

[16:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: repr_hash - so should find_repr_by_name.

[16:26] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3149bbb4fe

[16:30] <nine> Huh.... MVM_repr_register_dynamic_repr doesn't seem to be used anywhere

[16:32] <nwc10> anywhere any more?

[16:32] <timotimo> perhaps it was used in extops before

[16:32] <timotimo> was rakudo's scalar a repr or just a class of p6opaque?

[16:44] <nine> Looks like it has never been used for anything

[16:45] <nine> Didn't know we have this capability. But...it's intriguing :)

[16:46] <timotimo> if you embed moar in your own program and want to do some sick shit
