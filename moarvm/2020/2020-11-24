[09:50] <timotimo> hm. so would the WHICH of an Int have to be human-readable? because if we didn't render it in base10, but in whatever we like that's faster, that could be a good improvement on some workloads that check ints against presence in a hash or set

[09:56] <nine> I don't think WHICH is meant to be human-readable

[09:59] *** domidumont1 left
[10:02] *** domidumont joined
[10:20] <jnthn> No, it doesn't need to be

[10:23] <nine> Actually it doesn't even have to be a string. We expect an ObjAt. We assume that to be unboxable to a string in some places but I guess that's not strictly required

[10:40] *** Kaiepi joined
[10:42] <lizmat> Stiil, I'm pretty sure Int.WHICH will be inlined

[10:43] <lizmat> if it would be possible to dispatch on *exact* type versus type match, it could be made even simpler

[10:43] <nine> It will probably be inlined, yes. But avoiding stringification altogether would be even nicer

[10:44] <lizmat> Int:D:X: would match an *exact* Int:D, not a subtype ?

[10:44] <lizmat> Int:U:X: would match the Int type object and not a subtype of Int

[10:44] <jnthn> I don't think ObjAt should be string based really

[10:45] <nine> lizmat: why is type matching a problem?

[10:45] <jnthn> lizmat: If it's on the invocant, then submethod :)

[10:45] <lizmat> hmmmm....

[10:45] <lizmat> intriguiing

[10:46] <lizmat> jnthn: if not a str, then what ?

[10:48] <nine> WHICH is used for defining equality of objects. An equality test includes same type and same WHICH value. So the ObjAt implementation may actually depend on the type.

[10:49] <lizmat> can you have a submethod Foo *and* a multi method Foo in the same class?

[10:49] <lizmat> if not, how would I handle subclasses inside the class ?

[10:49] <jnthn> lizmat: No, you can't, so it's only useful in some cases

[10:49] <timotimo> anyway, yeah, i was refering entirely to the amount of cpu time spent inside moarvm when turning an int into a string

[10:50] <jnthn> It's not realy designed for that :)

[10:50] <lizmat> jnthn: ok, so not useful in the Int.WHICH case then

[10:50] <lizmat> nqp::tostr_I(self) is pretty fast, is it not?

[10:50] <timotimo> i don't know if stringifying to base 16 is alredy a lot faster than 10

[10:51] <lizmat> ah, like that...

[10:51] <timotimo> let me dig out the collatz code again

[10:53] <lizmat> timotimo: looks like there is no difference in base_I(foo,16) and tostr_I(foo)

[10:54] <nine> But there could be

[10:54] <nine> An optimized base 16 stringification must be faster than an optimized base 10 stringification

[10:55] <lizmat> yeah, looks like it *does* make a difference with --optimize=0

[10:55] <timotimo> whoops that froze my computer for a little bit ...

[10:55] <lizmat> so maybe my benchmark is just measuring the loop

[10:55] <timotimo> try measuring it in nqp land

[10:56] <jnthn> If you don't use the result then it may be optimized out :)

[10:57] <lizmat> yeah... :-)

[10:58] <lizmat> he... I just made a selfi   :-)

[10:59] <lizmat> (vim artefact of insertion after "self"  :-)

[10:59] <timotimo>    0.91%  perl6            libmoar.so          [.] MVM_coerce_i_s

[10:59] <timotimo> hmm

[11:00] <timotimo> did i misremember?

[11:00] <timotimo>   42.20%  perl6            libmoar.so          [.] MVMHash_gc_mark

[11:04] <nine> Do we miss an HASH_ITER_FAST equivalent

[11:04] <nine> ?

[11:04] <nine> Looks like gc_mark could benefit from hash iteration where we know that the hash cannot be modified during the iteration

[11:06] <lizmat> there are plenty of situations in the settings where we know the hash cannot be modified during iteration

[11:07] <lizmat> if there's some flag that can be set... tell me  :-)

[11:07] <lizmat> or an nqp::hash_fixed op  :-)

[11:14] <timotimo> inside gc_mark it's also impossible for a hash to be modified during the iteration

[11:14] <nine> oh, how_

[11:14] <nine> _

[11:15] <timotimo> hm?

[11:15] <nine> How can that hash be modified during gc_mark?

[11:16] <timotimo> it can not

[11:17] <nine> oh, "impossible" not "possible"

[11:17] <timotimo> need more coffee? :)

[11:17] <nine> apparently :)

[11:17] <timotimo> also, it's not that great of an idea to have such a short particle invert the meaning of a word

[11:18] <lizmat> yeah, it's anormal

[11:19] <timotimo> and amoral

[11:19] <lizmat> TIL anormal is not english  :-)

[11:19] <nwc10> abnormal

[11:19] <lizmat> yeah, that  :-)

[11:19] <nwc10> no, don't ask me which of (maybe 10) negation prefixes is the right one for any given word

[11:19] <lizmat> I was thinking of a shorter negation prefix  :-)

[11:20] <lizmat> works in Dutch and German  :-)

[11:20] <nwc10> atonal is the negation of tonal

[11:20] <lizmat> :-)

[11:20] <nwc10> achromatic

[11:20] <lizmat> .oO( ouch! )

[11:21] <jnthn> The number of negating prefixes in English is one of those "how does anyone ever learn this" moments :)

[11:22] <timotimo> black and ablack

[11:25] <lizmat> re base_I vs tostr_I: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/69f3e959b5

[11:30] <timotimo> whoa, orders of magnitude faster?

[11:32] <timotimo> have we mentioned flammable and inflammable yet?

[11:33] <timotimo> can has measurements for base_I and tostr_I? :3

[11:34] <lizmat> ah, I guess I had one 0 less in one of the benchmarks :-(

[11:35] <lizmat> yeah, it's more like a few %  :-(

[11:35] <timotimo> d'oh

[14:40] <MasterDuke> re converting strings to integers, i know gmp is much faster than tommath, but i think i was mainly testing with biggish integers, don't remember if i checked  more normal sized ones. it has some optimizations for bases that are powers of 2

[14:47] <sena_kun> Was migration to gmp blocked by something?

[20:30] <MasterDuke> this comment https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/ConcBlockingQueue.h#L8-L12 seems relevant to what i was planning to do with MVMArrayBody. do we want those characteristics for arrays?

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: 

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: Use `MVM_get_running_threads_context` to get the thread context directly,

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: instead of needing to take a mutex and iterate over the linked list of

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: threads.

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: 

[21:23] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: As the function is only used in one place, and is now much smaller, convert

[21:24] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: it to an inline function, which means moving it into the header file.

[21:36] <jnthn> MasterDuke: The motivation is a little more involved there, but at least partly the same, yes

[21:59] <MasterDuke> ok, good. i was comparing with MVMHash because i remembered nwc10's comments about it being two chunks currently, but planned for one, and it looked a bit different. wanted to make sure what i was planning would work ok
