[14:30] <MasterDuke> interesting. gmp and tommath have different values in the limbs/digits for the same bigint. that explains whey MVM_bigint_div_num isn't giving the same result

[14:32] <MasterDuke> for 248511577754725765407, gmp has 13 and 8703904796501594399, but tommath has 215 and 633454264253665567

[14:47] <MasterDuke> if i wasn't thinking through a fog that might not have taken so long to figure out. and i might have an idea of what to do next. how do i use ^^^ to do this https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L51 correctly?

[14:49] <MasterDuke> where instead of `d += a->dp[i];` i now have `d += mpz_getlimbn(a, i);`

[20:27] <brrt> ohai pamplemousse :-)

[20:27] <pamplemousse> o/ brrt :)

[20:27] <brrt> your connection appears a bit intermittent

[20:28] <pamplemousse> Yep, thick cinderblock walls, unfortunately

[20:32] <brrt> how are you doing?

[20:33] <pamplemousse> Doing decently! Just started a new job about a month back, which is both extremely interesting, and allows for better work/life balance, which has been really nice

[20:33] <pamplemousse> How about you? How are things?

[20:55] <brrt> OK overall.

[21:14] <pamplemousse> Any fun new developments in the world of JIT compilation for MoarVM since I've last been around?

[21:34] <timotimo> maybe not exactly in the jit realm, but our "new dispatcher" stuff that jn is working on is interesting

[21:34] <timotimo> oh pamplemousee would you like to take my "build an appimage with a rakudo and an application" prototype and make it actually good?
