[09:34] <timotimo> good nwc

[09:38] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/blob/master/service.p6#L11 check it :D

[09:39] <MasterDuke> nice. i assume you didn't create that manually?

[09:42] <MasterDuke> timotimo: btw, did you see i marked you as a reviewer on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1376 ? i figure you have the most knowledge of the line coverage stuff and might have a suggestion for a better presentation

[09:50] <timotimo> i very briefly looked at it; was there an example output?

[09:50] <timotimo> currently only have my laptop and it'll struggle a little with the spec test i imagine

[10:01] <MasterDuke> heh, i forgot to mention it's also a bit faster, but yeah, i can upload a sample

[10:19] <timotimo> cool

[10:22] <MasterDuke> PR updated

[10:22] <timotimo> where's my "make small-spectest"? :D

[10:22] <timotimo> "make chilltest"

[10:24] <MasterDuke> you can just make a single roast file

[10:25] <timotimo> right

[10:25] <timotimo> this makes it even more desirable to filter out "things basically every run does" like the "set_composalizer"

[10:26] <timotimo> or perhaps just to limit the number of "covered by files" that we output

[10:27] <timotimo> in any case, this ought to be useful!

[10:29] <timotimo> wow i think i overflowed my /tmp

[10:30] <timotimo> oh, quite possibly because it also spat out spesh logs

[10:30] <timotimo> that's no good

[10:34] <MasterDuke> yeah, if you have any suggestions on how to make it better i'm all ears

[10:47] <MasterDuke> oh, i have a list of filename:linenumber, but it could be a list of filename:linenumbers. e.g., instead of a:1, a:3, b:4, b:5 it could be a:1,3; b:4,5

[10:47] <MasterDuke> that would be smaller

[10:49] <timotimo> oh, right, that could be a good first optimization

[10:54] <MasterDuke> hm, unfortunately i'm not seeing a huge repetition in filenames on individual lines

[11:06] <MasterDuke> not sure which is better. leave the awkwardly long lines there because they may have useful information? or cut off at some arbitrary small number because the user probably won't care beyond that point?

[11:09] <timotimo> here's an idea: you can have a <span title="all the long text">+ 50 more</span> in the HTML

[11:11] <MasterDuke> and it'll show "all the long text" if you hover over the "+ 50 more" or something like that?

[11:11] <timotimo> yes

[11:11] <MasterDuke> cool

[11:11] <timotimo> though also i believe if you have a screen reader, it will always read that out

[11:11] <timotimo> so ... not the greatest maybe

[11:13] <MasterDuke> well, i am in favor of accessibility (and i saw the problems second-hand when i had a blind coworker), but i don't know how many blind raku programmers generating and reading coverage reports there are. it's not the most publicized tool we have

[11:16] <timotimo> there could be a tiny js snippet that just tosses all the titles out

[20:07] <[Coke]> hio

[20:07] <[Coke]> how goes?

[20:09] <nwc10> OK. Someone appears to have booby-trapped the beer fridge with some 7% bottles that look just like the regular stuff. Clearly a first world problem.

[20:09] *** sena_kun joined
[20:10] <nwc10> closest known COVID case is now 50m away

[20:10] <nwc10> (down from 200m earlier today)

[20:11] *** Altai-man left
[20:12] <timotimo> the horror that creeps closer and closer ever so slowly

[20:16] <MasterDuke> heh, i've started to get used to the beers here in the UK being a little lower percentage ABV than US beers. and then i tried a particular variety of a cider i liked, liked this new variety even more so had another. something seemed a little off, and then i realized this variety is 7%

[20:17] <nwc10> :-)

[20:17] <MasterDuke> and since it comes in 500ml bottles, unlike most US beers, i usually stick to just one

[20:18] <timotimo> cider in the US doesn't have alcohol in it i thought?

[20:18] <MasterDuke> we have hard cider also

[20:19] <MasterDuke> not as popular as in the UK

[20:21] <MasterDuke> we were just on a short holiday in cornwall last weekend and the waiter recommended a local cider. surprisingly it tasted almost exactly like US non-alcoholic cider, but was actually 6%. that could be a rude awakening for someone a couple bottle in...

[20:23] <timotimo> ha

[20:23] <timotimo> imagine your young child orders a cider and nobody knows about alcoholic cider being called "cider"

[20:25] <MasterDuke> yeah, i hope they usually warn people with US accents

[20:25] <nwc10> I'm trying to keep mine thinking that booze tastes bad. I encourage them to smell whisky, etc

[20:28] *** mtj_ left
[20:28] <timotimo> yeah, booze does taste bad tho

[20:28] <MasterDuke> the oldest (3.5y) has never really expressed an interest

[20:30] <MasterDuke> she's asked once or twice what we're drinking, and we just say it's something for adults. but we say that about coffee, caffeinated tea, etc., so i don't think she thinks of alcoholic drinks in a separate category

[20:31] <[Coke]> BEER FRIDGE

[20:31] <[Coke]> (sorry, just saw your note and was reminded I have one about 2m away from me.)

[20:31] <[Coke]> shame it's so (*@&#$ cold here now.

[20:32] <[Coke]> (going to hit 0C by 7pm)

[20:34] <MasterDuke> one beer fridge or one covid case 2m away?

[20:34] <[Coke]> beer fridge. I don't know where the nearest covid case is, which I think is a good thing

[20:37] <nwc10> so do I. Knowing that the neighbours of the neighbours have it is a bit unnerving

[20:40] <[Coke]> we had a few kids show up for halloween and the scariest thing was KIDS SHOWING UP

[20:41] * [Coke] thinks he should go refill the beer fridge before the election tomorrow. :|

[20:41] <nwc10> with gin?

[20:42] <[Coke]> I don't get that reference, but I do have gin in the house.

[20:42] <nwc10> just that it's much stronger than beer, for the same volume

[20:42] <[Coke]> about 5m from car here is a beverage mart (beer, soda) and a package store (wine, spirits)

[20:42] <[Coke]> nwc10: ah, nice

[20:42] <nwc10> beer fridge - 2m

[20:42] <nwc10> mart - 5m

[20:43] <[Coke]> different ms.

[20:43] <nwc10> you are trying to confuse us :-)

[20:43] <[Coke]> american units are the wurst.

[20:43] <[Coke]> 2 meters to the fridge, 5 minutes to the store

[20:43] <nwc10> oh.

[20:43] <nwc10> I thought you meant 5 miles

[20:47] <[Coke]> ... ish.

[20:47] * [Coke] fires up gmap

[20:48] <[Coke]> 8 minutes, 4.5 miles.

[20:48] <[Coke]> so, sure round both to "5m". :)

[20:48] <nwc10> indeed

[20:52] <[Coke]> ugh. instead I think I'll make a tea.

[21:16] <brrt> good *, nwc10, [Coke]

[21:21] <brrt> that's pretty cool

[21:21] <brrt> good on them
