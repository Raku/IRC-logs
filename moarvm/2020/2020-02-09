[21:41] <dogbert11> Hello brrt

[21:42] <brrt> ohai dogbert11

[21:43] <brrt> I thought about the expression JIT GC sync point shenanigans

[21:43] <brrt> and. I figured out that I needed the register allocator to be aware of that

[21:43] <dogbert11> is that difficult to accomplish?

[21:43] <brrt> No

[21:43] <brrt> but it means that the 'language' / IR must encode the concept

[21:44] *** zakharyas left
[21:44] <dogbert11> that sounds promising

[21:44] <brrt> and can't leave it up to the code emitter to figure it out

[21:44] <brrt> yeah

[21:44] <brrt> it means that the fix is simpler than I thought

[21:45] <dogbert11> it obviously pays off contemplating the problem for a while beore starting to code :)

[21:45] <dogbert11> *before

[21:48] *** sena_kun joined
[21:48] * dogbert11 hmm, it's quite windy outside

[21:56] <brrt> here, too

[22:03] <lizmat> it appears we're going to have a few interesting hours ahead still here in Limburg

[22:04] *** lucasb left
[22:06] <brrt> Arnhem is comparatively quiet

[22:06] <brrt> (as usual)

[22:10] <moritz_> the fun is only just starting here (NÃ¼rnberg region in .de)

[22:25] *** brrt left
[22:28] * sena_kun stares at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1231 which looks juicy

[23:32] *** sena_kun left
[23:32] <jnthn> There's a wind warning here, but I just walked home from the pub and it's like, not windy at all.

[23:33] <jnthn> I guess if it didn't really hit Nurnberg properly yet, we've a bit longer to wait here. :)
