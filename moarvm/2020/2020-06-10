[14:44] <raiph> Hi all

[14:44] <tellable6> 2020-05-30T05:35:41Z #whateverable <AlexDaniel`> raiph: I think 2014.01 is the first release of rakudo on moar

[14:44] <tellable6> 2020-05-30T05:36:55Z #whateverable <AlexDaniel`> raiph: I guess it's possible to build parrot stuff from the earlier days, but I'm not sure if it's worth it

[14:47] <raiph> AlexDaniel: Thx. (And getting back to 2014.01 -- 2 years prior to Christmas -- is about perfect btw. Aiui you were the/a prime mover for the amazing *able series. <3  xx Inf to you for that. :))

[14:48] <raiph> To all here: Re https://github.com/hoelzro/p6-linenoise/issues/28#issuecomment-463043982

[14:49] <raiph> "this issue sounds more like "MoarVM is telling Rakudo that it was built with -luv in its linker flags"."

[14:50] <raiph> I think that issue is in need of a little moarvm dev luv -- at least a comment to say it's *not* moarvm doing it (if it isn't)

[14:52] <raiph> Thanks to everyone for the Rakudo stack and to anyone who comments in the p6-linenoise issue.

[15:56] <nine> raiph: re https://github.com/hoelzro/p6-linenoise/issues/28#issuecomment-463043982 it's worth perusing how those users installed MoarVM and how those packages were built precisely. MoarVM bundles a libuv and links to it statically. I guess those distro packagers didn't follow that.

[15:56] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to raiph

[16:01] <hoelzro> btw, if anyone would like to assume maintainership of p6^H^Hraku-linenoise, I would appreciate it having a good home!

[16:01] <hoelzro> for that matter, is there anything akin to ADOPTME for Raku modules?

[16:11] <[Coke]> It is tempting, but no. :)
