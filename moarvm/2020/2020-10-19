[14:06] <patrickb> o/

[14:06] <tellable6> 2020-10-17T21:47:25Z #raku-dev <rba> patrickb: Happy I was able to help you.

[14:06] <tellable6> 2020-10-17T21:49:25Z #raku-dev <rba> patrickb: Can we discuss automation of star builds based on Azure Pipelines? As I understand all the building blocks are around for binary builds for Win/Mac. What do you think?

[14:07] <nwc10> \o

[14:08] <patrickb> I'd like to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1361 prior to the release. I'd be grateful for a second set of eyes before merging. Can someone have a look?

[14:11] <patrickb> rba: Can do. Though tyil should be on boat as well, as he currently creates star. Maybe it's automated already?

[14:11] <nwc10> OK, I don't feel competant to say whether it's the right approach to solving this problem. But

[14:12] <nwc10> I do have 1 question (which someone else better than me might ask)

[14:12] <nwc10> ho wait

[14:12] <nwc10> I've figure dit out

[14:12] <nwc10> problem exists between my keyvoard and chair

[14:19] <patrickb> I have to leave, but will backlog.

[16:15] <tobs> MasterDuke: I'm been looking again at the failure when linking libgmp.a to libmoar.so. The error I get involves a __gmp_binvert_limb_table which is a symbol declared in assembly files.

[16:17] <tobs> That could be the reason why ensuring that gmp is built with -fPIC doesn't help. I'm out of ideas, except for using an .so of gmp when linking libmoar.so, which would in turn require us to install that libgmp.so...

[16:17] <tobs> I don't know much about linking in any case.

[16:18] <MasterDuke> neither do i

[16:19] <MasterDuke> guess i could email their dev list

[16:19] <MasterDuke> unless anybody here has some more suggestions

[16:20] <lizmat> not me  :-(

[16:20] <lizmat> but contacting their dev list feels like a good idea

[16:20] <lizmat> having Raku as a client for their library could be interesting for them?

[16:28] <nine> So we have spec tests ensuring that we don't support features that other test cases require? That's hilarious :)

[16:29] <lizmat> yup  :-)

[16:29] * lizmat assumes nine is referring to what I said on #rakulang

[16:30] <lizmat> #raku rather  :-)

[16:30] <lizmat> #raku-dev even   sheesh

[16:30] <nine> the commit message for implementing hash slice binding

[16:30] <lizmat> yup

[16:42] <MasterDuke> i'm not at all surprised, especially for long-standing todos. someone probably saw that it wasn't currently working and added a test that it has the right kind of exception without realizing it was actually supposed to work

[16:49] <lizmat> well, if we agree on that, the PR can be merged and the exception tests removed  :-)

[16:56] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/8014b12dbf09f3614d86a0da346731301dc75ffa blame moritz for one of them, but it's old, which goes against my theory

[16:59] <MasterDuke> and timotimo for the other, also old https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/709242e4da7c0277c48523b5c7cf7f389cfeee7e

[17:02] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/2612   # fixes issues in the Parrot days

[17:02] <lizmat> so definitely pre-GLR  :-)

[17:09] <MasterDuke> the todo'ed ones are even older, from pugs it looks like
