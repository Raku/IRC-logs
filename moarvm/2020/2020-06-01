[06:54] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm 

[06:55] <nwc10> jnthn: MVMStaticFrame.c doesn't seem to copy lexical_frames_list (it does copy lexical_frams, the "hash", and num_lexicals, and plenty of other stuff). Given that spesh uses lexical_frames_list, I can't see how this isn't buggy. Which sort of implies that that code is never reached. What did I miss?

[07:14] <MasterDuke> nwc10: you mean lexical_names_list?

[07:14] <nwc10> MasterDuke: I think I do. Thanks. Your coffee must be better than mine :-)

[07:15] <MasterDuke> heh. it is pretty good, what i'm drinking now

[07:32] <MasterDuke> nwc10: that does seem to be an omission, but i added a print inside https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/MVMStaticFrame.c#L56 and it never gets hit when building nqp and rakudo

[07:32] <MasterDuke> so far the only thing that's triggered it is t/04-nativecall/00-misc.t

[07:35] <MasterDuke> doesn't look like any spectests did either

[09:24] <jnthn> nwc10: I think that the only time we do clone static frames is in freshcoderef, which is only used for stooges during compilation, and so the cloned ones probably never actually end up with code being run, and so would never be seen by spesh.

[09:24] <jnthn> nwc10: That's not a good reason for it to be broken, but it would explain why we've gotten away with it.

[09:26] <nwc10> ah OK cool

[10:34] <nwc10> jnthn: as far as I can figure out, lexical_names and lexical_names_list are (should - ie bug in clone) always created at the same time, and we can't have duplicate lexical names, and so HASH_CNT() on lexical_names should always be the same as num_lexicals, and would be cheaper written as that.

[10:34] <nwc10> not that I've tested any of this with assert()s yet, but I'm going to be surprised if there's a corner case where it's not true, as it' snot documented

[10:48] *** zakharyas1 joined
[10:48] <jnthn> Yes, it should always be true

[13:58] <bartolin_> lizmat: thanks for the weekly! (again)

[13:59] <bartolin_> lizmat: one note (maybe you could correct that): it was andreoss++ who did the work of renaming s/perl6/raku/ for the JVM backend. I only tested and hit the merge button: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/630 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3699

[14:00] <bartolin_> oops, sorry, not exactly the right channel ;)

[20:02] <nwc10> jnthn: when entries are created in sc_weakhash...

[20:02] <nwc10> in sc.c there's MVM_ASSIGN_REF:

[20:02] <nwc10>                 MVM_ASSIGN_REF(tc, &(sc->common.header), scb->handle, handle);

[20:02] <nwc10>                 MVM_HASH_BIND(tc, tc->instance->sc_weakhash, handle, scb);

[20:02] <nwc10> but in bytecode.c there's just

[20:03] <nwc10>                 MVM_HASH_BIND(tc, tc->instance->sc_weakhash, handle, scb);

[20:03] <nwc10> no MVM_ASSIGN_REF

[20:03] <nwc10> and maybe it should be "obvious" to me why it's not needed, but it's not :-(
