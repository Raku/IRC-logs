[08:03] <nine> Good morning!

[08:03] <nwc10> correct!

[08:03] <nwc10> :-)

[08:04] <nine> nwc10: nice to see that my work on enabling compiler warnings laid the foundation for actual fixes :)

[08:06] <nwc10> what amused me was that on x86_64 it seemed to be byte-for-byte identnical object code

[08:06] <nwc10> whereas on arm, the compiler compiled my bitwise AND test into < 0x80

[08:07] <nwc10> also, for some reason, trying to use MVM_UNLIKELY on the two if statements made gcc on ARM generate *worse* code

[08:07] <nwc10> it added 1 instruction into the loop

[08:07] <nwc10> which was actually already laid out in a way that I think was optimal for the likely case

[08:07] <nwc10> (I didn't think it through hard to "how would I write this in assemby"

[08:07] <nwc10> )
