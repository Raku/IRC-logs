[01:10] <timotimo> oh, i think the bit is logged inside the dispatcher itself, not the function that has invoked the dispatch

[01:18] <timotimo> which is probably what jn meant by "the calculation exactly matches the way used for the [...] lookup"

[01:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: 

[01:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: a bit of code to lookup the right annotation, then

[01:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: go to the stats to find the "guard index" entry. however,

[01:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: the spesh log data currently lands in the dispatcher

[01:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/new-disp: instead of the frame using the dispatcher.

[01:27] <timotimo> so now i'm not sure, do i go via the sim stack when incorporating the log data, do i go via caller-> in interp.c to figure out the bytecode offset and spesh correlation number, or what?

[01:28] <timotimo> those questions are jn-shaped :) :)

[08:09] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[08:10] <nwc10> MasterDuke: s/ anymore// in your statement earlier

[08:10] <nwc10> [and yes, that's Perl 5 :-)]

[08:10] <nwc10> jnthn: last I tried, NQP happy, SEGV in rakudo. I should try again

[08:11] <nwc10> actually, no, didn't run rakudo. did 8fb12697752c40e7f331f4e066c6ce40d2884cb9 / 23ba0e8d900e9075414e72e8046653b6464c13fd

[08:24] <MasterDuke> nwc10: ah. i saw a bunch of moarvm commits from a nwc10 in the past and assumed you'd been in at some point

[08:27] <nwc10> jnthn: NQP still says All tests successful.

[08:27] <nwc10> MasterDuke: I forget exactly how they arrived, but it wasn't via github

[08:34] <MasterDuke> nwc10: heh, carrier pigeon? western union telegraph? anyway, does that PR look reasonable?

[08:47] <nwc10> "look reasonable" - yes

[08:48] <nwc10> I only looked at it. Didn't test it

[23:00] <jnthn> Hmm, the azure builds all fail on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1302 with some git error...

[23:00] <jnthn> I also don't understand why it does JVM builds, which aren't relevant for MoarVM at all

[23:01] <MasterDuke> i mentioned the jmv thing to patrickb and left a .tell for him about the git error

[23:02] <MasterDuke> yesterday i think it was, but haven't seen him around yet
