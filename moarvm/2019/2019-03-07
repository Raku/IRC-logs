[06:53] <samcv> AlexDaniel, yeah i saw that

[06:53] <samcv> the unicode 12

[06:53] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: ‚Üë

[06:53] <AlexDaniel> samcv: wasn't my message :)

[06:53] *** domidumont left
[06:59] <AlexDaniel> interesting, new codepoints for people holding hands

[06:59] <samcv> oh sorry :)

[07:00] <AlexDaniel> single codepoints, not zwj sequences‚Ä¶ that's weird

[07:02] <AlexDaniel> hm, colorful circles and squares

[07:04] <samcv> MasterDuke, getting this from heaptrack ERROR:received duplicate exe event - child process tracking is not yet supported

[07:04] <AlexDaniel> u: 0x1F415 0x1F9BA

[07:04] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+1F415 DOG [So] (üêï)

[07:04] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+1F9BA <reserved-1F9BA> [Cn] (ü¶∫)

[07:04] <AlexDaniel> ah that's a safety vest

[07:05] <AlexDaniel> so dog+safety vest = service dog, and a separate codepoint for a guide dog

[07:07] <samcv> woah

[07:07] <samcv> dog+tshirt = dog wearing t shirt

[07:14] <samcv> MasterDuke, nvm i got it by running it manually

[07:16] <samcv> AlexDaniel, 46019 calls with 11.24GB peak consumption from: uv__read

[07:16] <AlexDaniel> interesting, it looks like initially it was proposed to add a separate ‚Äúperson in manual wheelchair‚Äù emoji and the submitter argued against ZWJ sequences for that, but they ended up adding wheelchair characters and zwj sequences
