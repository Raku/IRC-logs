[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Enable warnings about implicit fallthrough in switch statements on GCC

[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: A break; statement can be easily forgotten resulting in obscure bugs. Luckily

[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: gcc can warn us about them if told to do so, which we now do.

[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Of course in some cases a fallthrough is done on purpose. These cases can be

[08:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: marked with the new MVM_FALLTHROUGH macro.

[08:49] <nwc10> Not sure how MoarVM is supposed to probe for this sort of stuff.

[08:49] <nwc10> but cool find - I wasn't aware of that flag. It might be about to be added to the $ork code

[08:50] <nine> Apparently it was introduced with gcc 7

[08:51] <nine> I can probably hack in a version check for gcc. Won't be pretty though

[09:00] <nine> An alternative would be to enable -Wextra instead which includes the same check. But that'd require fixing boat loads of new warnings...

[09:00] <nine> Which may be worth it though

[11:40] <dogbert17> On my RPi4 I have gcc 8.3.0

[11:41] <nwc10> total digression, but it was pleasing that I could put the SD card from the RPi4 (in an adaptor, of course) into a very early RPi B, and it (also) boots happily on it.

[11:43] <dogbert17> that's cool

[11:44] <nine> That....feels more like a compiler bug

[13:56] <nine> This is funny: a P6opaque may have 2^16 attributes, but delegates for positional or associative things or box targets must be within the first 2^15 and just to be on the safe side we use a 32 bit unsigned for the name to index map

[13:56] <nine> Of course we then only use a signed 16 bit integer to actually iterator over the name to index map ;)
