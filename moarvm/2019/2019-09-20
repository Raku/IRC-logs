[11:38] <nine> Ha! My whole god damn Inline::Perl5 threading issue boils down to: do not load modules concurrently.

[11:39] <nine> Which is something that I have suspected from the start. What I didn't take into account is that DBIx::Class will load a couple of modules (like DBD::Pg or its storage backend) on-demand when creating the first database connection.

[11:40] <nwc10> and things blow up where/how?

[11:42] <nine> Since it's threading related, the errors look differently every time. But they are all compilation failures of the kind "Can't locate object method "mk_group_accessors" via package "DBIx::Class::Storage"

[11:43] <nine> Or "Undefined subroutine &DBIx::Class::Storage::BlockRunner::reftype called" or it suddenly no longer knowing Moose's "extend" function

[11:43] <nine> String found where operator expected at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.28.1/DBIx/Class/Storage/BlockRunner.pm line 49, near "qsub '$ENV{DBIC_STORAGE_RETRY_DEBUG}'"

[11:43] <nine> Actually that's really all about missing some symbol

[11:44] <nwc10> I'm a bit confused. By "concurrently" does this mean that you've got two different OS threads trying to do stuff in the same Perl 5 interpreter at the same time?

[11:44] <lizmat> that would be bad

[11:44] <nine> No, in different ones

[11:45] <lizmat> but Perl 6 thinking that they'd be available in all Perl 5's interpreters ?

[11:45] <nine> This is my test script: https://gist.github.com/niner/d2dee661dbaa0a5c0f49c0e7262898ee

[11:46] <nine> Each MoarVM thread gets its own Perl 5 interpreter to run code on. No data is being shared between them.

[11:46] <nwc10> OK, if I'm still confused, it's because if that's right, then surely each Perl 5 interpreter is completely unaware of any other interpreters, so should manage to stay self consistent

[11:46] <nine> exactly!

[11:47] <nwc10> which seems to imply that this is a Perl 5 bug, somehow

[11:47] <nine> Honestly it's starting to look more and more like that

[11:47] <nwc10> in that something is in Perl 5 global state that should not be. Or something that is there, isn't locked properly

[14:00] <lizmat> Q: was all of Bart Wiegmans' work reverted to get Rakudo HEAD spectesting clean again ?

[14:02] <jnthn> lizmat: I thought that what got reverted was some templates timotimo added, which ran into trouble?

[14:02] <lizmat> I'm unsure, hence my question  :-)

[14:03] <jnthn> that's my recollection, and `git log --grep=revert` seems to agre

[14:03] <lizmat> ok, *phew*

[14:03] <jnthn> It looks like just several templates that were reverted

[14:04] <jnthn> Yeah, 6 in total

[14:40] <nine> nwc10: I managed to reproduce the failures with a plain C program embedding perl. Intriguingly they only happen when I load the full Atikon::DB::Timemngt schema, not when I load just DBIx::Class.
