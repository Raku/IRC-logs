[08:24] <lizmat> anybody against bumping MoarVM / NQP ?

[08:24] <lizmat> now?

[09:33] <brrt> lizmat: not me

[09:37] <robertle> I am trying to understand how moar handles the awkward generational GC case where an old object holds a reference to a young one

[09:37] <jnthn> Write barrier

[09:37] <robertle> is MVM_sc_wb_hit_obj() the right thing to look at? I am confused by the fact that it talks about compiling so much...

[09:37] <jnthn> See wb.h

[09:38] <jnthn> No, that's not it at all

[09:38] <lizmat> brrt: bump has been done, Geth is still out so you may not have seen it

[09:39] <robertle> thanks, wb.* makes a lot more sense :)

[09:44] <brrt> ok lizmat!

[14:43] <timotimo> you can always make parsers in C better by running afl against them :3
