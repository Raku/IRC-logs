[09:44] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: wait, uhâ€¦ I don't know about this?

[09:44] <timotimo> i actually thought it happened in a non-released commit until last night

[09:44] <timotimo> like, in an experiment or something

[09:45] <AlexDaniel> japhb: what's your version exactly?

[09:46] <AlexDaniel> also, given that it's Feb already and we're just two weeks from the next planned releaseâ€¦ maybe we should skip this one

[09:46] <AlexDaniel> maybe not, because actually almost all blockers are gone

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> but what is that thing with Red?

[09:53] <AlexDaniel> I can reproduce that

[09:55] <AlexDaniel> Blin can help, but it'll take some time to heat up the pan

[10:38] <AlexDaniel> so this commit https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/71a19c61a2c3c3582474a84644e33e76c0e66005

[10:38] <AlexDaniel> was when the regression in Red was fixed

[10:38] <AlexDaniel> R#2640

[10:38] <synopsebot> R#2640 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2640 [rerevert] Some sort of regression in Red module

[10:39] <AlexDaniel> and on that exact commit it panics
