[08:35] <nine> MasterDuke: did you run those 6.d spectests with parallel jobs? I think there were some changes to roast to fix issues caused by that.

[08:38] <MasterDuke> nine: yeah. i couldn't repro with another 4-5 runs though

[09:18] <MasterDuke> ok, with a lot of load on the system t/spec/S10-packages/precompilation.rakudo.moar has failed a couple times

[13:22] <dogbert17> releasable: next

[13:22] <releasable6> dogbert17, Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. 7 out of 436 commits logged (⚠ 9 warnings)

[13:22] <releasable6> dogbert17, Details: https://gist.github.com/d25614dd4fc90deff041c249128710ca

[13:22] <dogbert17> hmm

[13:27] <dogbert17> valgrind is still not on friendly terms with t/spec/S17-procasync/encoding.t

[13:30] <dogbert17> and we still have the old bug in t/spec/MISC/bug-coverage-stress-6.d.t, i.e. "continuationinvoke expects an MVMContinuation"

[13:33] <dogbert17> despite the above I do believe that the next release will be very stable
