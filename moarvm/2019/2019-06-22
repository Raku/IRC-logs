[18:53] <MasterDuke> something to consider bundling with moarvm? https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc

[18:54] <MasterDuke> HN discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20249743

[19:13] <timotimo> have you given it a try? :)

[19:13] *** Kaiepi left
[19:14] <MasterDuke> not yet. still trying to figure out the profiling business

[19:15] <MasterDuke> any suggestions?

[19:16] <timotimo> i've only just finally gotten a second display again

[19:16] <timotimo> now maybe i can have a look at .. anything finally i guess?

[19:18] <MasterDuke> psu fixed?

[19:19] <timotimo> nope

[19:19] <timotimo> i'll have to get to a place that has a known-working psu and known-working motherboard i expect

[19:20] <MasterDuke> ugh

[19:24] <nwc10> timotimo: computer hardware seems to hate you

[19:24] <nwc10> :-(

[19:25] <MasterDuke> nothing i've tried has made a difference. i guess there's something i just don't know to check

[19:25] *** Kaiepi joined
[19:35] <timotimo> what other hardware has recently been mean to me, hmm

[19:35] <timotimo> oh, my laptop at the gpw

[20:26] <MasterDuke> uh, i just locally reverted my remove-profiling-overhead commit and i'm still seeing `<anon> gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1824` at the top of a profile...

[20:27] <MasterDuke> could someone else try and confirm that for me?

[20:28] <MasterDuke> timotimo: ^^^

[20:34] <MasterDuke> lizmat: ^^^

[20:35] <MasterDuke> also tried reverting https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/423a9cc7d since that seemed like the next oldest significant profiling related commit, no change

[22:26] <jnthn> moarvm.org back up after a little downtime (hardware failure, VM was migrated to new hardware with an hour or two, but there was a network config issue after that)

[22:27] *** jnthn left

[22:58] <timotimo> i have most of my desktop back

[22:58] <timotimo> i somehow managed to lose my sata controller card

[22:58] <jnthn> Like, physically lose? :)

[23:03] *** lucasb left
[23:08] <timotimo> yeah

[23:08] <timotimo> misplaced

[23:08] <timotimo> i put it somewhere, but somewhere didn't give it back

[23:08] <timotimo> i don't think i removed the sata cables either, so it should be easy to see

[23:08] <timotimo> what with four sata cables coming out of it
