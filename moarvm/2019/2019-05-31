[14:18] <brrt> ohai everyone

[14:26] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[15:15] <dogbert17> hmm, something seems to be up with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9ed86e4c95f929f2960e87c83ea009fe62bf366e - 'Eliminate an unused collectable flag'

[15:16] <dogbert17> moar: src/gc/collect.c:589: MVM_gc_collect_free_nursery_uncopied: Assertion `item->sc_forward_u.forwarder != NULL' failed.

[15:17] <dogbert17> when running t/spec/S04-phasers/in-loop.t

[15:19] <dogbert17> I have compiled MoarVM with --no-optimize

[15:22] <dogbert17> gist https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/ebfd1ff0ac02c4a86f4f6218f4d9b208 timotimo's superscript might come in handy here

[15:24] <jnthn> I hope you rebuilt the extops too :)

[15:24] <jnthn> (In Rakudo)

[15:24] <jnthn> .oO( Toss the extops! )

[15:25] <dogbert17> nope :(

[15:25] <jnthn> Good, that's probably the issue :)

[15:26] <dogbert17> all I did was 'perl Configure.pl --debug  --no-optimize --prefix=../../install/' followed by make install

[15:26] * dogbert17 tries to do a proper rebuild

[15:27] <jnthn> ah, you'll need to do a Rakudo rebuld with that one

[15:27] <jnthn> *rebuild

[15:28] <dogbert17> in progress :) btw, is there an easy way to tell when a rakudo rebuild is necessary?

[15:30] * brrt needs to eat...

[16:38] <jnthn> When it breaks impressively without? ;-) Normally if existing types or constants in header files change there's a good chance, though.

[16:39] <jnthn> But once the extops finally go away, it'll be a thing of the past :)

[17:42] <dogbert17> jnthn: thx for the info. I rebuilt Rakudo and ran a spectest. One file failed, t/spec/S04-phasers/in-loop.t. It seems as if your changes might have forced an old bug to show its ugly face.

[19:51] <pamplemousse> The blog entry got a bit long, so I split it and am going to be following up with the more progress update-y bit a little later today. This one focuses on things that were helpful in getting started: https://yakshavingcream.blogspot.com/2019/05/getting-started-developing-for-perl-6.html

[21:11] <brrt> btw, I had no idea that IRC would be intimidating

[21:11] <brrt> I'm getting old

[21:14] <japhb> I thought the worry about social norms was insightful.  New chat systems always have their own, as well as each community within those systems, so I'm not surprised by that one -- but I also hadn't thought of it before (aside from knowing that people who had seen some of the more abrasive channels might fear we were the same).

[21:15] <japhb> (new to the user, I mean)

[21:29] <brrt> Yes.

[21:30] <brrt> I've never really cared for eh, other chat media

[21:31] <brrt> But I guess that does make the community a bit less accessible than it would be otherwise

[21:39] <japhb> Depending on the quality, we may want to better advertise the Discord bridge, for "easier access" reasons.  (I've not used it myself.)

[21:43] <brrt> should check it out once
