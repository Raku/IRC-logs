[08:04] <brrt> I need slightly more bits for the tiler to store the register class..

[13:17] <brrt> re: register requirement encoding

[13:17] <brrt> current state of the art is one 32 bit bitmap for both flags and register number, if any

[13:20] <samcv> good * brrt

[13:24] <timotimo> * * *

[13:41] <brrt> ohai samcv

[13:41] <brrt> happy new year

[13:41] <brrt> anyway, I was going to say, I think I'm going to drop that design

[13:42] <brrt> because 8 bits per register specification is a bit too small

[13:42] <brrt> (it is just about large enough for the x86-64 though)

[13:43] <brrt> well, that's not fair, it is ample for x86-64

[13:47] <brrt> What I sometimes do for this, is encode the data as a string... but that only works if the data-per-byte is really small

[13:49] <brrt> maybe the simplest thing is just to use 1 byte for the flags, 1 for the fixed number (if any)

[13:56] <samcv> happy new year

[13:56] <samcv> what's this for?

[14:16] <brrt> this is for the floating point support

[14:17] <brrt> I need to indicate the register class used for a value

[14:18] *** leont left
[14:19] <brrt> so there's thre pieces of information:

[14:20] <brrt> - is this a register-value or not (e.g. a 'flag' doesn't get an explicit value)

[14:20] <brrt> - what register class is this value, if any

[14:21] <brrt> - is this register fixed (e.g. div uses rax,rcx for its operands)

[14:21] <brrt> - what is the fixed register, if any
