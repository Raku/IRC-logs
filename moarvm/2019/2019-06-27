[14:39] <timotimo> just now, at 16:30, i noticed i didn't have breakfast yet today. earlier today i was on the phone, accidentally hung up with my cheek on the touchscreen and didn't notice until like a minute later

[14:40] <pamplemousse> Food would probably be a good thing to do :)

[14:41] <timotimo> i'm actually eating right now!

[14:41] <timotimo> i just don't know quite how i managed to not notice

[14:41] <timotimo> i blame the heat

[14:42] <timotimo> it might be a good idea to get more water to drink, too

[14:44] <pamplemousse> Heat without being hydrated can definitely make your head spin a bit.

[15:02] <brrt> timotimo: heat wave ftw!

[15:02] <timotimo> F This Wave?

[15:03] <brrt> :-D

[15:03] <timotimo> there's 8l jugs of volvic mineral water that has a little simple "tap" mechanism

[15:03] <timotimo> really fun to use
