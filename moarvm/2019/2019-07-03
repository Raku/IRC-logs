[14:39] <timotimo> oh zstd, your error messages are to die for â€¦

[14:46] <timotimo> sorry, of course i meant "to die from"

[14:57] <timotimo> the assertion i get with DEBUGLEVEL cranked up to 3 isn't a whole lot better, but i guess it's a start ... :|

[15:08] <timotimo> pushing bytes around, what fun

[15:09] <timotimo> making every single off-by-one in the book possible

[15:17] <timotimo> bleehhh this buffer shuffling

[15:19] <jnthn> Could be worse. Could be using the Java ByteBuffer API :P

[15:20] <timotimo> i've kind of made my own, and yeah, it's kind of bad :)

[15:21] <jnthn> I dunno if it's just me, but that one seems optimized for me being very confused and getting stuff wrong

[15:21] <timotimo> this problem space is able to get me very confused as well

[15:22] <timotimo> that's the api that has .flip and such, right?

[15:23] <timotimo> i just invented the acronym FBB, it's like BFF, but i haven't decided what it means yet

[15:25] <timotimo> Cannot resolve caller splice(NativeCall::Types::CArray[uint8]:D, Int:D, Int:D); Routine does not have any candidates. Is only the proto defined?

[15:25] <timotimo> aaw

[15:32] <timotimo> is this ... working?!?

[15:33] <timotimo> slow, tho

[15:38] <timotimo> and of course it runs into another error :<

[15:44] <pamplemousse> I'm running into a bit of an issue building MoarVM, NQP, and Rakudo. I pulled all the recent changes, submodule update-ed, etc and tried to make each of them and none of them would build. I re-ran the configure script for MoarVM and it builds now but NQP and Rakudo are still not building.

[15:44] <pamplemousse> NQP complains that "MoarVM op 'freemem' is unknown as a core or extension op" and Rakudo complains that moar_core_sources does not exist.

[15:44] <pamplemousse> Any thoughts?

[15:45] <pamplemousse> I have no local changes

[15:45] <timotimo> that sounds like the moarvm is too old for that nqp

[15:46] <timotimo> what does 'git show" show as the latest commit in the three repos?

[15:48] <pamplemousse> MoarVM's repo has a commit from today, NQP's from June 27th, and Rakudo's from July 1st

[15:49] <timotimo> OK, perhaps the "moar" that last successfully installed is an older one

[15:56] *** patrickb left
[16:02] <pamplemousse> I've installed the newly built one that I built with the changes I pulled today and I'm still running into the same problem

[16:02] <timotimo> ah dang

[16:02] <Kaiepi> might be an issue in nqp

[16:02] <timotimo> perhaps something related to the freemem op actually did go wrong

[16:03] <Kaiepi> i was able to install moar/nqp/rakudo a few days ago so maybe something went wrong super recently

[16:04] <pamplemousse> It's also possible I'm overlooking something on my end

[16:04] <timotimo> you could give completely nuking whatever your --prefix is set to to the ground a try

[16:05] <timotimo> if you do that, you can probably paste the entire console history and maybe we spot something

[16:05] <pamplemousse> I'll give it a shot

[16:11] <Kaiepi> i'm not sure if nqp was rebootstrapped or not when those ops were added, i think that was around the time i was told i didn't need to do that with every new op added

[16:12] <timotimo> right, only if nqp itself needs the op in its compiler

[16:13] <Kaiepi> should probably rebase my getsockopt/setsockopt grant pullreq that's been open forever so it doesn't rebootstrap at some point

[16:14] <Kaiepi> don't really need to worry about it until i'm towards the end of when i finish my work on IO::Socket::INET since the last changes don't make any sense without socket option support existing though

[16:14] <timotimo> mhm

[16:20] * dogbert11 is trying to build Rakudo on his shiny new Raspberry Pi 4

[16:26] <pamplemousse> I'm getting the feeling it is a problem on my end. I think it probably was an issue with it being an old version of moar. I noticed that the version of moar being built inside the MoarVM repo wasn't the same as the one in my prefix/bin directory. Tried manually copying that over, forgetting that installing copies other files into other places that also need to be referenced by nqp and rakudo.

[16:27] <timotimo> ooooh

[16:27] <timotimo> "killall moar" can fix that

[16:27] <timotimo> of course any still-running perl6 processes can die from that

[16:27] <timotimo> so maybe first "pidof moar" to see if there's anything, and if so, what

[16:28] *** squashable6 left
[16:29] <Kaiepi> never heard of either of those commands, i use pgrep and pkill

[16:29] <pamplemousse> Now that I've nuked everything and trying to set it up again, I'm noticing that everything run by calling "make install" in the moar dirrectory does nothing. Any call to /usr/bin/perl -MExtUtils::Command does nothing

[16:31] <timotimo> o_O

[16:31] <timotimo> "hard drive full"? *shruuug* that's very weird

[16:32] *** squashable6 joined
[16:32] <pamplemousse> Nope, I definitely have space. And if I try to make the directories it's trying to make, but using mkdir instead of /usr/bin/perl -MExtUtils::Command -e mkpath, it makes the directories just fine.

[16:33] *** AlexDaniel left
[16:33] <timotimo> hum. "strace -f make install" will spit out a crapton of text, but maybe something obvious pops out

[16:34] *** squashable6 left
[16:34] <ugexe> pamplemousse: what if you try to create directories using that perl command, but somewhere else?

[16:34] *** squashable6 joined
[16:44] <pamplemousse> I think I've figured it out! Anything that uses a ~ in the path to the directory being made fails to make the directory. So ugexe, I can make directories elsewhere and inside the MoarVM repo (thank you for asking, that's how I was able to figure out what was going wrong) using relative and absolute addressing, but nothing with a ~

[16:46] <Kaiepi> ah

[16:46] <Kaiepi> use $HOME instead, that works for me

[16:46] <timotimo> oh damn

[16:47] <timotimo> i wonder if your moarvm folder now has a ~ folder in it that has everything there

[16:48] <pamplemousse> It sure does

[16:51] <pamplemousse> Thank you all, sorry I didn't catch that sooner

[16:53] <timotimo> ehh, that would't make my top 10 embarassing things i needed help with :P

[16:54] <Kaiepi> ditto
