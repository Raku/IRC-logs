[00:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: on windows it used to fail because WSAStartup had been

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: missing, and it lead to listensocket to become -1, but

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: errno had been reset to "no error", leading to a silly

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: error. Let's not have that again in the future for

[08:16] <nine> I can only assume that somewhere in a thread's startup there's still a place where a well timed GC of another thread may interfere

[13:38] <Guest37021> t/spec/S32-io/out-buffering.t and t/spec/S32-io/socket-recv-vs-read.t

[13:39] <Guest37021> the first script panics here: #1  0x00007ffff74f32b3 in MVM_gc_root_add_temps_to_worklist (tc=0x555555758cc0, worklist=0x555556f52910, snapshot=0x0) at src/gc/roots.c:272

[18:29] <dogbert17> does anyone know if MVM_repr_alloc_init can cause a GC? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprconv.c#L16

[18:30] <timotimo> allocate would definitely do that

[18:31] *** pamplemousse joined
[18:31] <timotimo> and since the initialize function call is wrapped in MVMROOT, we're at least expecting it to be a possibility for that to cause GC

[18:31] <dogbert17> I'm trying to debug a MoarVM Panic - Collectable %p in fromspace accessed

[18:31] <dogbert17> I have found the following so far

[18:31] <timotimo> does it have anything to do with profiling or debugserver or anything else with instrumentation?

[18:32] <dogbert17> no, just a small nursery

[18:32] <dogbert17> the object pushed on this line is what the panic complains about - https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/asyncsocket.c#L801

[18:33] <timotimo> ah, so the repr_alloc_init there could have caused GC and that could have moved body.schedulee around?

[18:33] <timotimo> no

[18:33] <timotimo> async_task would be the one that'd move

[18:34] <timotimo> earlier in the code, async_task is already rooted, and later in the code as well

[18:34] <dogbert17> all I can say is if I put this on line 800 - MVM_ASSERT_NOT_FROMSPACE(tc, ((MVMAsyncTask *)async_task)->body.schedulee); it will panic there

[18:34] <timotimo> so that makes a lot of sense

[18:34] <timotimo> that it'd need a rooting earlier there

[18:35] <dogbert17> if I put MVM_ASSERT_NOT_FROMSPACE(tc, ((MVMAsyncTask *)async_task)->body.schedulee); in the beginning of the function 'listen_setup' it wont trigger at that location

[18:35] <dogbert17> i.e. areound line 760

[18:35] <timotimo> i wrote the code that's wrong

[18:35] <timotimo> wouldn't you know it

[18:36] <dogbert17> cool, do you see a fix in front of you :)

[18:37] <timotimo> yeah

[18:38] <dogbert17> ++timotimo

[18:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 57a6d475b1 | (Timo Paulssen)++ | src/io/asyncsocket.c

[18:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/57a6d475b1

[18:39] <dogbert17> that was quick

[18:40] <timotimo> you made it easy

[18:40] <dogbert17> will give it a whirl

[18:41] <timotimo> did the point release already happen? this is a candidate to be cherry-picked to the release branch, too

[18:42] <dogbert17> I don't think it's out yet

[18:42] <timotimo> yeah, samcv, could this commit 57a6d475b1 also make it in?

[18:43] <dogbert17> ha, now it failed at a totally different location

[18:43] <timotimo> damn, we haven't fixed every bug yet? :(

[18:44] <dogbert17> #1  0x00007ffff75cedb7 in MVM_gc_root_add_temps_to_worklist (tc=tc@entry=0x69aef0, worklist=worklist@entry=0xa56330, snapshot=snapshot@entry=0x0) at src/gc/roots.c:272

[18:44] <timotimo> oh, damn

[18:44] <timotimo> add_temps_to_worklist means something that has been rooted was already wrong at that point, perhaps?!

[18:45] <dogbert17> I have seen that when running another file

[18:45] <timotimo> hey, can you put a pointer check thingie into MVM_gc_root_temp_push or what it's called?

[18:45] <dogbert17> I guess I can

[18:46] <timotimo> the rest of that stack trace would be interesting, too

[18:46] <dogbert17> you mean MVM_gc_root_add_temps_to_worklist right?

[18:47] <timotimo> yeah

[18:47] <timotimo> no

[18:47] <timotimo> sorry

[18:47] <dogbert17> oops

[18:47] <timotimo> er, the rest of that stack trace i mean

[18:47] <dogbert17> ah, sec

[18:47] <timotimo> the rest of the stacktrace that ends in add_temps_to_worklist

[18:47] <timotimo> but the pointer check would go into whatever MVMROOT uses

[18:47] <timotimo> MVM_gc_root_temp_push is the name

[18:48] <dogbert17> https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/cc3723e9fd00957e50fdefaa4be2f61f

[18:48] <dogbert17> note that optimization was turned on

[18:48] <timotimo> oh? capturelex? frame_move_to_heap?

[18:48] <timotimo> that doesn't bode well

[18:49] <dogbert17> uh oh

[18:51] <dogbert17> cool, there is a #define MVM_TEMP_ROOT_DEBUG 0 flag that I could try using

[18:51] <timotimo> cool

[18:53] <dogbert17> running but so far nothing. these bugs are quite elusive
