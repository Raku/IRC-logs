[21:50] <japhb> Got this trying to install Red on latest Rakudo:

[21:50] <japhb> ===> Testing: Red:ver<0.0.2>:api<0>

[21:50] <japhb> MoarVM panic: Trying to unwind over wrong handler

[21:50] <japhb> (Mentioning it here because a MoarVM panic seems better here than in #perl6-dev)

[21:53] <timotimo> yeah, Red's author already approached us about this
