[20:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3f8fea9bc: OUTPUT: ¬´Bytecode validation error at offset 264, instruction 39:‚ê§operand type 64 does not match register type 32 for op decont in frame <unit>‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[20:57] *** MasterDuke left
[21:00] <jnthn> The validation error is correct

[21:01] <jnthn> Seems the QAST compiler takes the first thing as the register to write into

[21:01] <jnthn> And an int from istrue won't go into an object register

[21:43] <dogbert11> jnthn: wrt to t/spec/S04-exceptions/fail.t, running perl6 with --optimize=0 seems to hide the problem

[21:49] <jnthn> Probably --optimize=1 also?

[21:51] <dogbert11> yep
