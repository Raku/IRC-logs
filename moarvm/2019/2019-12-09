[21:50] <brrt> I have this longish post pending... but I want to share with you my main thesis

[21:50] <brrt> Scripting happens when there's two preconditions that are met

[21:52] <brrt> One, a system with an interesting amount of complexity has matured to the point of being encapsulated (e.g., an RDBMS)

[21:52] <brrt> Two, there is greater demand for computational services than can be reasonably met by the typical application languages, and more to the point

[21:54] <brrt> Application languages are almost always unpractical for scripting because they emphasize a model-centric structure that is redundant for scripts (the model might just be the data itself).

[21:55] <brrt> System programming languages are unsuitable since they tend to expose concerns that are relevant to system programmers (because systems tend to be developed at the edge of the 'possible'; this is because systems provide services, and we always want as much service for as little as possible)

[21:55] <brrt> but those concerns are irrelevant for scripts, since scripts will typically leverage systems (i.e. the 'actual work' is done by some library or server)

[22:00] <brrt> the main concern for scripting, instead, is to have as little 'barrier' to interfacing with the systems as possible

[22:02] <brrt> (this is why, e.g. python3's decision to make str() a proper-unicode-type, *and* use that for operating system interfaces, is the wrong answer for a scripting language; the proper type of a string representing an external-resource, is whatever-fits-the-external-resource, for a scripting language, correctness be damned)
