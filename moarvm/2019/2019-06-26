[15:06] <dogbert11> timotimo: do you want me to make a PR of the misplaced line here (https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/log.c#L106) or will you fix it?

[15:08] <timotimo> which of y'all found it and gets the ++ in the commit message?

[15:23] <dogbert11> give it to MasterDuke :)

[18:42] <brrt> hmm, I get the same 'ModuleLoader.moarvm' problem when I use a slightly more complex NQP file as input source

[18:43] <brrt> but, I don't get that problem if I set '--libpath' correctly

[18:45] <brrt> pamplemousse: I was actually going to suggest, you can try strace to figure out what the program is doing when it's starting up

[18:50] <pamplemousse> I can give that a go. I've been tracing through using MVM_COVERAGE_LOG, like timotimo suggested the other day, to figure out how the start up worked

[19:37] *** MasterDuke joined
[20:02] <brrt> that, or stepping through with gdb/lldb

[20:05] <timotimo> right, you can always "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)" from inside gdb/lldb (if you "up" far enough to get a frame with a tc in it; that part is easier if you disable the JIT, because neither gdb nor lldb understand how the jit builds stack frames

[21:07] <brrt> which is what I should probably fix at some time
