[09:07] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: MoarVM already has a nice releases page: http://moarvm.org/releases.html

[09:07] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: With information about each release on it

[09:08] <jnthn> I think that's generated from the changelog

[09:08] <jnthn> (Nowadays)

[09:08] <jnthn> And so probably there's a script that extracts that

[09:09] <jnthn> Though I'm not quite sure what the value of duplicating it all on GitHub is... :)

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: the value is rather clear

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> if you go to github to download nqp and rakudo, then surely the same should be possible for MoarVM, no?

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> just from the user experience point of view

[15:45] *** robertle left
[15:46] *** zakharyas left
[15:46] <jnthn> If that's the way we're making Rakudo and NQP available going forward, then yes, it's nice to be consistent, but in that case is there any point in moarvm.org also carrying it, instead of just linking to github?

[15:47] <timotimo> when github goes down again :)

[15:47] <jnthn> :P

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> I don't think it's a big issue if tarballs are mirrored elsewhere

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> which is why people should feel free to reimplement downloads on rakudo.org in place of the current redirects :)

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> which should all work, by the way

[15:53] <ugexe> the releases all say "The tarball for this release is available from https://rakudo.org/files/rakudo." but the link goes to github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases

[15:54] <ugexe> maybe just one of them is?

[15:54] <jnthn> I guess if we automate the uploading to both places, it's not really an extra hassle from the release manager.

[15:54] <jnthn> *for

[15:55] <ugexe> i guess i just imagined that

[15:55] <ugexe> oh it forwards back to github

[15:56] <AlexDaniel> yeah, it's a bit weird

[15:56] <AlexDaniel> but the same announcement is sent by email and stuff, so it used to make sense

[15:56] <AlexDaniel> also the same file is in the git repo
