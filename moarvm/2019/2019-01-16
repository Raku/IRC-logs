[13:01] <dogbert17> hmm, one bug seems to have eluded proper reporting, hmm. If I add the bug it will become a blocker for sure knowing AlexDaniel :)

[13:49] <brrt> hmmm, that's odd

[13:52] <brrt> apparently, andrew shitov has managed to convince the FOSDEM minimal languages room to host a presentation on perl6

[13:52] <brrt> That makes me chuckle a bit

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: like if that's a bad thing :)

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> also, I didn't run Blin yetâ€¦

[13:58] <tadzik> minimal, heh

[14:28] <timotimo> well, it's about building a compiler for a minimal lang, so that's fine?

[14:54] <brrt> yeah
