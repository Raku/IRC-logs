[16:35] <japhb> Oooh, looks like a MoarVM coding day for jnthn++

[16:36] * japhb is really looking forward to seeing that branch land, because I'm very curious how it will affect the performance of Terminal::Print animations

[16:46] <jnthn> Well, not so much coding day as coding late-afternoon. Picking off some of the smaller issues. Do need a day to pick off the larger ones.

[17:06] <jnthn> These are all very silly

[17:07] <jnthn> Seems we now pass all S02 with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING on in that branch, though

[17:12] <jnthn> Current spectest run is looking a lot better, though

[17:12] <jnthn> Curious. A good number of the failures involve threading tests

[17:19] *** brrt` is now known as brrt

[17:24] <jnthn> Yeah, less fails with that rebase and HEAD of nqp/rakudo

[17:25] <jnthn> Though still some. More work ahead. :)

[17:25] <jnthn> And this is all without the DU chain checker on, which will carp aplenty and also needs to be satisfied.

[17:26] <nwc10> indeed it does :-/

[17:37] <japhb> Still, this sounds like quite a bit of progress.  :-)

[17:38] <nwc10> enjoy food/beer/evening off?

[17:40] <jnthn> Well, certainly going to go and enjoy food now. :)

[17:41] <jnthn> I'm guessing the bunch of concurrency ones that fail are going to have a common root cause

[17:42] <nwc10> with the DU chain checker turned off NQP builds with ASAN

[17:42] <jnthn> Thankfully thre's some non-concurrent ones to look at first, that might be easier targets.

[17:42] <jnthn> nwc10: Yes, it's one of those cases where the problem is close to harmless, but we really should do the bookkeeping right

[17:43] <jnthn> But it's not quite trivial to do, alas

[17:43] <jnthn> (Needs renames and PHI insertions)

[17:43] <nwc10> and passes make test

[17:43] <jnthn> with NODELAY, ooc?

[17:43] <nwc10> er, yes.

[17:43] <nwc10> +#define MVM_ARRAY_CONC_DEBUG 1

[17:43] <nwc10> +#define FSA_SIZE_DEBUG 1

[17:43] <jnthn> Only dared try BLOCKING so far :)

[17:43] <jnthn> OK.

[17:44] <nwc10> MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[17:44] <nwc10> MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1

[17:44] <nwc10> MVM_SPESH_GUARD_DEBUG=1

[17:44] <jnthn> Alright, off to nom some saussage and potato salad

[17:44] <nwc10> enjoy

[17:44] <japhb> Mmmm, now I'm hungry again

[17:45] <jnthn> Made with vinegar rather than majonaise, which iiuc meets the approval of Austria and some, but not all, parts of Germany? :)

[17:45] <jnthn> I did listen in on an argument about this important matter once, and believe there's some regional disagreement. :)

[19:26] <brrt> how are you doing?

[19:28] <pamplemousse>  Doing alright. Making progress on the linker. I've been working on a blog post which I'm planning on posting tonight or tomorrow about the progress I've made so far.

[19:30] <japhb> ++pamplemousse  # Impending progress post  :-)

[19:32] <brrt> yes, I'll be really interested

[19:32] <brrt> as well

[19:33] <pamplemousse> I'll post a link as soon as it's finished!

[19:33] <brrt> cool

[19:34] <brrt> Any problems you've been having?

[19:37] <pamplemousse> No big problems so far, just keep running into small issues with alignment and making sure I'm putting the right things in the right places in the ELF file.

[19:38] <brrt> are you using the elf.h header in linux?

[19:39] <pamplemousse> Yes

[19:41] <pamplemousse> The alignment issues were when I was reading things in from the MBC file but I found my mistake

[19:55] <nine> jnthn: yes, vinegar is obviously the correct choice. I don't know what's there to argue about ;)

[20:27] <brrt> I see... We can probably make that conditionally dependent to compile

[20:29] <jnthn> brrt: Wow, I never heard of mayo made from vinegar. :)

[20:30] * sena_kun .oO ( we can make mayo ingredients conditionally dependent on chief's opinion at food's compiling time )

[20:43] <japhb> sena_kun: If making mayo is compiling, is making the potato salad linking?

[20:45] <sena_kun> japhb, I am afraid to think what eating means in this metaphor! (inb4: probably just using the software)
