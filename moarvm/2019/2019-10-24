[14:55] <Kaiepi> i suspect the way async sockets deal with their handles may be prone to memory leaks

[14:58] <Kaiepi> it frees the handles whenever they get closed, rather than from the gc free function. it's not guaranteed there will be a socket that needs closing though, like if uv_tcp_connect or uv_tcp_bind fail, since uv_tcp_create doesn't actually create any kind of socket until another function that requires it to exist is used

[15:01] <Kaiepi> is this something worth looking into before the release or should i just focus on reverting the changes to dns resolution that are breaking?

[15:03] <jnthn> No, I'd rather that such changes would have time for more testing

[15:03] *** robertle_ left
[15:04] <nine> Kaiepi: the important part of releases is to not introduce new errors. As long as we ensure that, we can say that every release is better than the previous one and we're on the right track. Requiring a release to fix all known errors would just lead to never releasing at all.

[15:06] <nine> That's also why reverting is often preferable to last minute fixing frencies - you can't say what new issues you introduce with your fixes.

[18:10] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: wow, well. Is it just a revert or are there any extra changes?

[18:25] *** brrt joined
[18:28] <Kaiepi> i'll need to double check AlexDaniel, this was something i needed to do manually

[18:36] <Kaiepi> actually AlexDaniel, would reverting this whole mess and remaking the changes that are worthwhile to have so the commits are possible to work with after the release be ok?

[18:39] <Kaiepi> rather than just the commit that broke tests

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: If you can do that, then probably yes

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: but it sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so I'm definitely not insisting on that

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: also, is anybody from the moarvm team helping you out with the grant stuff? They might have a better opinion than I have

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> by helping out I mean like supervising and giving advice

[19:10] *** robertle_ left
[19:14] <Kaiepi> i'm supposed to have a supervisor, but we haven't been in contact since we first got introduced, which was at least a couple months ago by this point AlexDaniel

[19:14] <Kaiepi> not sure if they're on the moarvm team or not

[19:18] <Kaiepi> AlexDaniel, the changes themselves didn't take terribly long to make, just i had a lot of trouble getting anyone to review them before they could be merged, so it's something i can do

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: then you're probably the only person who can do a good decision :)

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: As long as I'm relatively sure that the changes are not breaking existing code in the wild, I'll be fine with it
