[00:29] <MasterDuke> timotimo: hm, could we start profiling, enter/exit a frame a bunch, figure out how long that took, end profiling, discard what we've collected, and then start profiling again?

[07:28] <timotimo> the MoarVM::Profiler module could perhaps be something to get some unit tests that would at least find the worst breakages

[08:37] <timotimo> oh

[08:37] <timotimo> oh no

[08:39] <timotimo> gitg's "discard selection" doesn't mean "unselect everything", it means "remove the selected changes from the files"

[08:39] <timotimo> well, that's fun

[08:43] <timotimo> that explains why it opens up a confirmation dialog

[08:43] <timotimo> that i immediately clicked "ok whatever" on

[08:45] <timotimo> fortunately "changes outside of vim detected, reload buffer from disk?" can be undone simply with the undo command

[11:07] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i've seen the commits go by, glad to see all the enhancements to profiling. however, what i was asking about would have to take place in moarvm, an initial step to `profile` the cost of profiling a function so we can exclude that from the reported cost

[11:07] <lizmat> MasterDuke: oki  :-)

[11:33] *** Voldenet joined
[11:33] *** Voldenet left
[11:33] *** Voldenet joined
[12:08] <MasterDuke> lizmat: it's the sort of thing that might make sense to expose as an option to exclude or not via the api you have, since it won't be exact and someone might want the values included

[12:13] <lizmat> afaik, the values returned by nqp::mvmendprofile are from code run since nqp::mvmstartprofile

[12:13] <lizmat> and they're by thread

[12:13] <brrt> good *

[12:13] <lizmat> so I don't think there's actually any additional hidden cost ?

[12:16] <brrt> lizmat: for the weekly, can you say that GSoC has started, that we have 2 new students working on MoarVM (and I think, one on perl6 documentation), and that (at least) one student already has a PR merged? :-)

[12:16] <lizmat> do we have a link to the projects ?

[12:22] <brrt> let me get it...

[12:24] <brrt> https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/4873743862595584/overview/ - dunno if this is a public link though

[12:24] <lizmat> nope, needs a login  :-(

[12:24] <brrt> https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4713351599357952/ this ought to be a public link though

[12:29] <lizmat> yup, it is, thanks!

[12:36] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i think the cost of the profiling functionsMVM_profile_log_(enter|exit)  are being included. iirc, that's why jnthn said `identity` has more that zero exclusive time in many of my profiles (it's essentially a no-op normally, but the added profiling functions means it can't be entirely removed)

[12:36] <lizmat> ah, like that...  hmmm

[12:37] <lizmat> yeah, removing "indentity" from the profile usually makes sense :-)

[12:39] <MasterDuke> so subtracting out the estimated cost of profiling should drop `identity` to near the bottom of profiles

[21:39] <timotimo> were you planning something?

[23:15] <timotimo> oh, the instrumented profiler leaks 100% of its collected data btw, haha

[23:15] <timotimo> because so far the next thing after a profiler run has ended was that the program would output the data to a file and quit

[23:17] <timotimo> but freeing all the data before returning the hash/list datastructures would be good for memory usage, too. as in, the dumping code could be run with much less memory pressure

[23:55] *** MasterDuke joined
[23:56] <MasterDuke> timotimo: that would be good, Iâ€™ve had profiles get killed by the oom killer when writing them out
