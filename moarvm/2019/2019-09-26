[17:02] <nine> Yeah....if there was more activity I could take the lack of a "NNNOOOOO don't do that!" as a sign that turning guard sets into MVMCollectable was sane...

[17:03] <dogbert11> perhaps it is sane

[17:08] *** robertle joined
[17:08] <jnthn> Ah, I meant to look at that

[17:15] <jnthn> Hmm...not sure

[17:17] <jnthn> I mean, it marks the things within the plugin guard set but I don't see how it prevents the memory related to them being freed

[17:18] <jnthn> Hm, what's allocating during guard resolution anyway...

[17:18] <jnthn> Oh, the collected objects

[17:19] <jnthn> Since spesh plugin resolution needn't be reentrant, I wonder wonder if we can simply allocate such an array once and hang it off the thread context

[17:19] <jnthn> otoh, that sadly won't help with MVM_repr_get_attr_o

[20:35] <nine> jnthn: if the guard set were an MVMCollectable we wouldn't need the MVM_fixed_size_free_at_safepoint and the MVMROOT in resolve_using_guards would keep it alive.

[20:36] <nine> Or maybe the whole plugin state

[20:46] *** zakharyas left
[21:22] *** AlexDaniel left
[21:54] <jnthn> nine: Yes, that may be the cleanest option

[21:54] <jnthn> At least, I didn't come up with a better idea

[21:55] <jnthn> I didn't convince myself that the current solution is correct. I didn't prove it ain't either, but my gut feeling is something's not right

[23:13] <patrickb> Could someone have a look at PR #1182? That's enabling paths with unicode symbols on Windows. I'd like to have that merged before the next release, as I see it as a prerequisite for a binary release on Windows. (https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1182)

[23:13] <tellable6> 2019-09-26T16:23:38Z #perl6-dev <vrurg> patrickb can we have perl6-m in rakudo source not run moar but be linked against moar's dynlib, same as inst-perl6-m?
