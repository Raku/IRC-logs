[11:53] <MasterDuke> timotimo: how come some functions don't get linkified by your script even though the corresponding filename is?

[11:57] <timotimo> give me an example and i'll see that i wiggle the regex around

[12:02] <MasterDuke> the bottom comment on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1105

[12:03] <MasterDuke> #1 in the backtrace, check_reg

[12:04] <MasterDuke> oh, and that one has some files that aren't linkified

[12:09] <timotimo> i've got a little whitelist of things that are valid moar-related "first argument in argument list" things, like tc, instance, ...

[12:09] <timotimo> "idx" is not among them

[12:09] <timotimo> and neither is "data"

[12:10] <timotimo> not entirely sure if the whitelist is a sensible approach

[12:17] <timotimo> oh, i think my script is actually killing syntax highlighting in gists

[12:19] <timotimo> updated the gist: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/timo/7cfe71a667bbdfa0dbd1510431da45a4/raw/96ff5c56064807e7fa94826395baf399deab5f6e/Perl6-Github-Linkify.js

[12:21] <timotimo> fixes gist syntax highlighting as well

[12:59] <MasterDuke> cool, catches more stuff. it does now sometimes highlight the whole line though

[14:19] *** Altai-man_ left
[14:19] <timotimo> examples, please?

[14:49] <MasterDuke> #1 and #4 in the bottom comment of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1105

[15:21] <timotimo> interesting. but but it does linkify the entire thing from start to end

[15:21] <timotimo> so that's okay to me

[16:25] *** Geth left
[16:26] *** Geth joined
[17:45] <MasterDuke> yeah, works fine, just cosmetic nitpicking

[17:49] <timotimo> OK

[17:50] *** squashable6 left
[17:52] <MasterDuke> oooooo, can you do the same thing for rakudo backtraces?

[17:54] <timotimo> it's already in

[17:54] <timotimo> do you have one where it doesn't happen?

[22:52] <MasterDuke> timotimo: oh, is it supposed to already?

[22:53] <timotimo> yes

[22:55] <MasterDuke> nice. but https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2921 has a backtrace with at least one line that could be highlighted

[22:58] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2738 has some too

[22:59] <MasterDuke> oh!

[22:59] <MasterDuke> now it's working!

[23:00] <MasterDuke> wait, this is the link it's creating https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L2861 so not quite right...

[23:00] <timotimo> it makes some NaN links, eh?

[23:01] <timotimo> an earlier version of the script should work better

[23:01] <timotimo> i changed the regex a lot to add support for valgrind output

[23:01] <MasterDuke> some NaN links, but see it's also trying to link to rakudo files in the moarvm repo

[23:01] <timotimo> that explains it then

[23:01] <timotimo> it's getting the wrong branch

[23:02] <MasterDuke> afk for dinner, but timotimo++
