[12:30] <nine> For those curious: the Perl 5 IO::Handle threading issues I came across are caused by https://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/986a805c4b2 This is not thread safe: PL_check[OP_LINESEQ] = io_ck_lineseq; According to perlapi(1) "PL_check" is global to an entire process and must not be written to directly. Instead there's wrap_op_checker

[12:35] <timotimo> oh damn

[12:39] <nine> So replacing that direct array access with wrap_op_checker is half of the fix. The other will be to add some checks to the new op_checker so it won't indiscriminately modify any OP tree it encounters, but only the functions it was meant for

[15:33] <dogbert17> do you have any theories as to what might be wrong?

[16:01] <brrt> no

[16:01] <brrt> :-)

[16:01] <brrt> making matters worse, rakudo is apparently sensitive to the number of env vars

[16:02] <MasterDuke> sensitive in what way?

[16:04] <timotimo> that was one point in the talk that also had coz (the causal profiler) in it

[16:05] <timotimo> that changing the amount of commandline flags or environment variables may be enough to disturb the memory layout of you prrogram to change performance significantly

[16:05] <timotimo> but that was only for performance

[16:08] <brrt> sensitive, in that the exact frame that is compiled by spesh/jit at a specific point in the program, tends to depend on a myriad of factors, even if MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING is set; and that the number of env vars seems to be a significant parameter in that

[16:08] <brrt> .... sometimes I hate rakudo for that

[16:08] <brrt> (part of the torment on implementors I'm sure)

[16:08] <brrt> so, here's the thing though.

[16:09] <brrt> I think that scripting is all about the interface between the script and the thing that it is scripting, i.e. some sort of opaque computational systme

[16:10] <brrt> R, for instance, is essentially a scripting language for a linear algebra library written in FORTRAN

[16:11] <brrt> lua is a scripting language for arbitrary programs that adhere to the C ABI

[16:11] <brrt> perl5 is a scripting language for the POSIX abi, plus a regex engine, plus any libraries loaded via XS, etc

[16:11] <brrt> you can go on and on with this

[16:12] <brrt> If that is so, and *if* perl6/raku is supposed to be a scripting language, then it doesn't make much sense to *also* have everything out in the open

[16:12] <brrt> having every thing about the compiler/runtime out in the open is not a scripting language property

[16:13] <brrt> it is rather a property we see in languages like smalltalk and lisp

[16:13] <brrt> I don't know how to classify that type of language

[16:14] <timotimo> can you clarify "out in the open" a bit more? like the ability to use slangs for example?

[16:14] <brrt> for instance, yes

[16:14] <brrt> in raku/perl6, the interface between the grammar/regex engine, and the rest of the language, is 'open'

[16:15] <brrt> in perl5, python, ruby, javascript, etc. it is very much not so

[16:15] <timotimo> when will we be able to just save a rakudo memory image and ship that as our program

[16:15] <brrt> scripting languages have an opaque interface between the script and the thing that they are scripting

[16:15] <brrt> or I should say, tend to have that

[16:15] <brrt> and that's somewhat crucial as it allows implementors to cheat

[16:16] <brrt> </rant>
