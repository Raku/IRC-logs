[06:30] <nwc10> ASAN finds your new code very boring.

[06:32] <brrt> blegh

[06:33] <brrt> what's writing in C like if we don't get a few SEGVs along the way

[12:38] <brrt> ohai pamplemousse

[12:39] <brrt> I saw your summary post. Well done

[12:39] <pamplemousse> Thanks! Is there anything you think I should add, or clarify?

[12:41] <brrt> Not really... btw, I think using tar to pack a directory into a file has excellent precedence

[12:42] <brrt> we/you/someone should post them on reddit

[12:43] <pamplemousse> Good to know! I thought it was way cleaner than what I was originally trying to do.

[12:44] <pamplemousse> I'll post it! Just wanted to get another set of eyes on it so I could check that I hadn't missed anything big.

[12:51] <pamplemousse> For anyone interested here, my summer in review post is up: https://yakshavingcream.blogspot.com/2019/08/summer-in-review.html

[15:51] <MasterDuke> jnthn: my question was pretty bad. what i want to do is not require the user to calloc the memory. i guess i could memset it to zero? i guess i don't understand why the realloc causes that particular error

[16:25] <timotimo> when you calloc, you should also use recalloc instead of realloc so the new data gets zeroed out, too

[16:26] <MasterDuke> timotimo: is recalloc available everywhere?

[16:37] *** jnth is now known as AlexDaniel

[16:46] <timotimo> we've implemented it ourselves i think

[16:46] <timotimo> but it's really just realloc + memset

[16:57] <MasterDuke> that won't help me though. the error/warning is happening during the realloc. so i'll still get it even if i memset after

[18:02] <timotimo> in that case it sounds like the pointer itself isn't quite right

[18:02] <timotimo> i.e. you could be passing an uninitialised address to realloc

[18:03] <timotimo> i mean not what it points to, the pointer itself
