[07:49] <brrt> that was one of the bugs, at least

[07:49] <brrt> there's a tiny bit of weirdness going on with annotations, in, that there can be multiple deopt annotations and they don't necessarily refer to the same target address

[07:53] <nwc10> brrt: this is a brtt but he/she/it satirises "Well volunteered" brilliatly: https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/d1noux/sunsetting_python_2/ezpqfl9/

[07:53] <nwc10> and much better than my typing

[08:00] <brrt> lol

[08:00] <brrt> well, if/once I understand why it does the weird thing, I'll certainly be happy to change it

[13:54] <timotimo> oof, profiling a program and `perf top` shows profile_log_enter and profile_log_allocated very high up the list

[14:01] <MasterDuke> any way to make those cheaper?

[14:04] <timotimo> i have an idea or two, nothing concrete yet

[14:41] <timotimo> the solution to code duplication in C is macros; i hope you love backslashes!

[15:07] <timotimo> https://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/projects/frdwarf/  - oooooooh

[15:11] <MasterDuke> how would that help us? just by making `perf report` faster?

[15:11] *** zakharyas left
[15:11] <timotimo> i thought it'd be able to make "perf record" faster, too

[15:11] <timotimo> i.e. be able to gather either more samples per second, or more stack data per sample

[15:12] <MasterDuke> huh, cool

[15:12] <timotimo> though actually thinking about it, i think "perf record" literally just takes the top parts of the stack by copying it

[15:27] *** domidumont left
[15:27] <Guest15407> indeed

[15:27] <Guest15407> I'm having problems finding new ones now :)

[15:27] <timotimo> damn

[15:28] <Guest15407> will one of you fix the missing break or should I PR it when I get home?

[15:34] * Guest15407 relocates &

[15:40] <timotimo> now ... how do i display the "high score lists" properly in the heapanalyzer shell ...

[15:40] <timotimo> for each of the snapshots it has a list of 40 for each of "frames by size", "frames by count", "objects by size", and "objects by count"

[15:41] <timotimo> it's obviously not always the same 40 in each of the snapshots

[15:41] <timotimo> theoretically it could have "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", "5th" as the column titles

[15:42] <timotimo> especially frame names can be very long

[15:42] <timotimo> maybe i'll skip implementing it in the shell and go for the moarperf impl first, since that can render charts

[16:02] <nine> Guest15407: will do. There's another one, I'll commit as well

[17:12] <Kaiepi> can someone review https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1166 ?

[17:23] <timotimo> Kaiepi: i wonder if the AsyncTask actually causes the ri->handle and ri->buf_type pointers to be updated in case GC happens

[17:37] *** domidumont left
[17:53] <timotimo> Kaiepi: i can't do a full review of the PR :(

[17:58] <timotimo> you can more easily find out if your roots are correct if you set GC_DEBUG to 3 in src/gc/debug.h (or gcdebug.h?) or to 2 and reducing the nursery size drastically in src/gc/collect.h (or something)

[18:04] <Kaiepi> ok
