[10:54] <timotimo> looks like more-pea has last been rebased 4 months ago?

[10:57] <timotimo> i was looking at the spesh log for that "create a bunch of As" benchmark from yesterday, and one thing that caught my eye was using sp_getvc_o; i wonder if it's worth anything to know that at tthis point the attribute will never have been accessed, so we know exactly how vivification will go

[10:57] <timotimo> but it could very well be that more-pea will already or very soon just make that go away anyway

[10:58] <brrt> \o

[10:58] <nwc10> o/

[10:59] <timotimo> ohai brrt

[10:59] <timotimo> how goes it?

[11:01] <timotimo> anyway, i can totally confirm that we can get even faster in this particular benchmark, because it's still using a hash to pass the values for a and b around

[11:01] <brrt> pretty well, dogbert17++ has been hounding me for missing breaks the last few days

[11:01] <timotimo> you can not catch a break, huh?

[11:03] <brrt> hadn't expect so many of them tbh

[11:04] <timotimo> finding out how much work is needed to make moarperf happily use more than one profiler file was a bit of a surprise ...
