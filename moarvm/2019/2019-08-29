[11:50] <timotimo> it should fall back to version 2 if libzstd isn't available, as indicated by pkgconfig

[19:34] <MasterDuke> timotimo: fyi, seeing a couple `incompatible pointer type` warnings in src/spesh/worker.c

[20:52] <timotimo> do those lines not have "(MVMCollectable **)&blah" in them?

[20:59] <MasterDuke> nope

[21:01] <timotimo> e7bad16e538629b3838b759ed5b7f8112c4408b1 - check this commit

[21:02] <timotimo> huh

[21:02] <timotimo> it looks like the recent commit by zhongnian tao changed stuff a little too much

[21:08] <timotimo> i have an idea how to fix it, but i'd like to fix it as good as possible

[21:13] <MasterDuke> other than just redoing those changes? but anything else would involve re-writing history right? which isn't usually recommended on a public branch

[21:13] <timotimo> i could cherry-pick the changes individually onto current master, for example

[21:14] <timotimo> then it wouldn't involve merging older commits to the front

[21:14] <MasterDuke> `git diff e7bad16e538629b3838b759ed5b7f8112c4408b1~1 e7bad16e538629b3838b759ed5b7f8112c4408b1 >foo.patch; git apply foo.patch`, right?

[21:20] <timotimo> the patch reverted a whole lot more than just that

[21:20] <timotimo> i think it undid the entire heap snapshot format stuff

[21:21] <MasterDuke> oh!

[21:23] <MasterDuke> yeah, looks like 7d090921d522962070aa31b819bd416f8222da26 did it

[21:23] <MasterDuke> just revert it?

[21:25] <timotimo> would probably want to see what the difference is between that commit and "only" reverting what it reverted
