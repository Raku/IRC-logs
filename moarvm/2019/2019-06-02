[13:41] <dogbert17> o/

[13:45] <dogbert17> is changing MVM_GC_DEBUG_LOG_FLAGS in src/gc/orchestrate.c to, e.g. 2, the correct way to enable GCDEBUG_LOG output to stdout?

[13:45] <dogbert17> hi brrt

[13:46] <dogbert17> are you hacking on the JIT?

[13:48] <brrt> not atm

[13:48] <brrt> but I will be soon enough

[13:49] <dogbert17> is it a refactor or will you be adding new features?

[14:13] <brrt> I need to finish floating point support one of these days

[14:13] <brrt> after that, I'm planning to make the expression 'tree' format a linear format

[19:12] <ugexe> patrickb: im not sure anyone knows what the MoarVM piece of your rakudo/nqp/moarvm changes are

[19:12] <patrickb> hm... It only changes --no-relocatable to --relocatable.

[19:13] <ugexe> you say dont merge one without the others, but i was not able to determine which moarvm PR to bug people to merge

[19:13] <patrickb> The other PRs work without this one, but for consistency sake I'd like to also get it in, so the three behave the same...
