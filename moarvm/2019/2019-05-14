[09:23] <brrt> ohai jnthn

[09:27] <brrt> do you have anything you're working on recently?

[09:28] <jnthn> Was making the EA be PEA :)

[09:28] <brrt> I saw that you're going to Riga for perlcon eu

[09:28] <brrt> what's the difference between those?

[09:28] <jnthn> Though last week I had family visiting and took them on a trip to Olomouc, plus had some customers visiting, so didn't really get to touch any of it.

[09:29] <jnthn> P = Partial, so we can handle things only escapsing on some code-paths

[09:29] <nwc10> that's short enough to be a URL. Who needs a blog post? :-)

[09:31] <timotimo> escapsism

[09:31] <timotimo> i'm finally putting an interpreter into moarvm so we can run code in it

[09:32] <nwc10> Ook?

[09:32] <timotimo> Oog, oog!

[09:32] <nwc10> ./r

[09:32] <nwc10> aha. ther'es my focus

[09:35] <brrt> I see

[09:35] <brrt> Okay, that's fairly cool. It's a speculative optimization then :-)

[14:07] <brrt> I had one of those 'ideas' today

[14:07] <timotimo> i'm glad i'm not the only one who gets those

[14:07] <brrt> Actually, this is a backport of an idea that I had in another context

[14:07] <brrt> I can improve the register allocator in steps

[14:08] <brrt> More specifically, I can assign to each live range, the register set of permissible registers

[14:08] <brrt> a register set is a 32 bit number

[14:08] <brrt> so that's cheap

[14:11] <timotimo> look, what is this strange output:

[14:11] <timotimo> this is the name of the frame we're running from

[14:11] <timotimo> run-the-program

[14:11] <timotimo> thank you for your attention

[14:11] <timotimo> i wonder if it has anything to do with the program that has "log = sf.name" in it

[14:12] <brrt> timotimo: where is it output from?

[14:13] <jnthn> :)

[14:36] <timotimo> 21 commits sounds like a rebase

[14:40] <jnthn> It was :)

[14:40] <timotimo> a fresh base to have great new stuff put onto it

[14:41] <timotimo> today it turns out that my understanding of "characters outside the BMP must be turned into backslash sequences of UTF16 surrogate pairs" was actually wrong (for json, that is)

[14:41] <timotimo> that is only for *if* you *want* to escape a character that happens to be outside of BMP

[14:42] <timotimo> you can just use literal utf8 data inside strings if you want

[15:34] <japhb> timotimo: What's the reference on that?  I was always under that impression as well (needing to transform characters outside the BMP for JSON), but I admit I have just trusted received wisdom, not read the specs myself.
