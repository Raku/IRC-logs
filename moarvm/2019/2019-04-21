[11:46] <kawaii> Hello o/

[11:46] <kawaii> When do you guys plan on cutting MoarVM 2019.04? I was hoping to cut a Rakudo 2019.04 release candidate tomorrow.

[12:01] <MasterDuke> kawaii: samcv has been doing them recently, might want to ping her directly

[12:01] <yoleaux> 18 Apr 2019 13:43Z <vrurg> MasterDuke: it's not so many changes in the branch, so --target=parse fails too.

[12:02] <kawaii> samcv: ping ^ :)
