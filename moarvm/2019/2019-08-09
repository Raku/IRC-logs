[15:23] <brrt> timotimo: you at perlcon riga?

[15:23] <timotimo> nope

[15:25] *** zakharyas joined
[15:29] <brrt> hmm. Any one of us who is?

[15:29] <brrt> I know lizmat is because I saw her on the live stream :-)

[15:29] <timotimo> i saw samcv present the proposal for perlcon in amsterdam next year

[15:29] <brrt> I have like, notes on the whole perl5/perl6 thing, that I should probably publish soon

[15:29] <timotimo> i think tyil is there

[15:29] <brrt> oh hey, in amsterdam again :-D

[15:29] <brrt> perlcon/ams

[15:30] <timotimo> the competition is perlcon on cyprus

[15:30] <timotimo> in an all-inclusive hotel

[15:30] <brrt> hmm

[15:31] <timotimo> i have no idea if the voting results are already public?

[15:31] <brrt> Well, I'm not travelling to cyprus, I don't think, especially in summer

[15:32] *** zakharyas left
[15:33] *** zakharyas joined
[15:33] <brrt> why not perlcon reykjavik

[15:33] <brrt> unify NA and EU

[15:34] <timotimo> how about "perlcon but maybe a volcano erupts and either you can't get there or you can't get away"

[15:35] <brrt> that's what boats are for?

[15:36] <brrt> perlcon faroer islands :-D

[15:36] <timotimo> perlcon galapagos

[15:37] <brrt> perlcon anywhere but here...

[15:39] <timotimo> perlcon in the sky with diamonds

[18:49] *** brrt joined
[20:06] <samcv> <brrt> why not perlcon reykjavik

[20:06] <samcv> i would maybe be ok with that. though it's not the cheapest place

[20:07] <brrt> so I've heard

[20:12] <samcv> yeah. the hostel was cheap. but the food was like 3x as much. and i'm guessing venues aren't cheap

[20:12] <samcv> well. the hostel was cheaper than most. everything else was more

[20:15] <brrt> non-cheap venues might be a nonstarter

[23:21] <Kaiepi> * OpenBSD: only get active CPU core count (Ben Davies)

[23:21] <Kaiepi> that's my patch!

[23:21] <Kaiepi> also fucking hell, i went over a year forgetting to actually update dyncall's submodule?

[23:31] <timotimo> congrats on your patch yo

[23:43] <timotimo> blurgh, i'm knee deep in a debugging session of why Compress::ZStd is writing over some moarvm internal structures

[23:47] <timotimo> i think it goes ahead and frees the storage i had been using for the buffer

[23:51] <timotimo> welp, i "fixed" it by reallocating buffers after every little bit of work so that's great

[23:59] <timotimo> still seem to have an off-by-one somewhere
