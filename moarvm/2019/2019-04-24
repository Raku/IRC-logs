[11:28] <brrt> ohai #moarvm

[11:28] <brrt> did nine actually remove all the MAST code?

[11:34] <brrt> I can't find it anymore

[11:45] <patrickb> brrt: I think he did.

[12:07] <timotimo> yeah, we don't ever mast any more with the mastcompiler.c thing

[12:07] <timotimo> so it's just gone now

[12:13] *** domidumont joined
[12:17] <brrt> hmm

[12:17] <brrt> ok

[12:17] <timotimo> you need that thing for the jit testing thing?

[12:17] <brrt> well,

[12:17] <brrt> I need something for the JIT testing thing

[12:17] <brrt> I'm on the fence whether or not I want to enter expression trees directly

[12:17] <brrt> or whether I want to compile spesh graphs, then spesh/JIT them

[12:18] <brrt> compiling spesh graphs is probably more useful though

[12:18] <brrt> because it allows us to test spesh as well

[12:18] <timotimo> aye

[12:20] <brrt> ok

[12:20] <brrt> there we go, then

[12:21] <brrt> :-)

[12:21] <timotimo> it'd be very good to have something that lets us test spesh

[12:23] <brrt> do you mind s-expression syntax?

[12:24] <jnthn> I suspect that we could just write an assembler-like thing in NQP using the code-gen support there

[12:24] *** robertle left
[12:26] * timotimo got to "what was i thinking when i wrote this code" in record time

[12:27] <jnthn> .oO( Why do people always assume they *were* thinking? :D )

[12:28] <brrt> jnthn: thing is, I want something that itself doesn't run spesh 'naturally'

[12:28] <timotimo> oh, no, i meant "what, was i thinking?!" :D

[12:28] <brrt> but yet, I considered that as well

[12:29] <timotimo> well, it's fine if it just writes the bytecode out, right?

[12:29] <timotimo> i.e. it'd use the MAST::Foo things we've got for rakudo

[12:29] <timotimo> then a different process (not necessarily actually separate though) is fed the bytecode to run it

[12:39] *** yoleaux joined
[12:52] <brrt> hmmm

[12:52] <brrt> that's also possible, yes

[12:53] <timotimo> haha, i just tried to declare a variable in C with "my"

[12:53] *** zakharyas joined
[12:54] <jnthn> .oO( #define my void * )
