[08:25] <AlexDaniel> samcv: make a release without this if possible: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1212

[08:32] <brrt> AlexDaniel: why?

[08:40] *** sena_kun joined
[08:50] <AlexDaniel> brrt: most likely it won't be blinned, and if it looks innocent I trust it even less :)

[08:51] *** domidumont joined
[08:52] <brrt> I see

[08:57] <nwc10> hai brrt

[09:04] <AlexDaniel> brrt: also we should somehow make releasing from a branch the norm

[09:04] <brrt> maybe yes

[09:05] <AlexDaniel> for moarvm, that's already the case for nqp and rakudo

[13:01] <Guest13443> what would be the proper way to debug the following error message:

[13:02] <Guest13443> 'MoarVM panic: Corrupt multi dispatch cache: cur_node != 0, re-check == (nil)'

[13:03] <Guest13443> there's logic available to print out the cache but is that enough?
