[07:27] <xiaomiao> Good morning. I'm seeing a rather weird failure running ./Configure.pl and can't figure out how to debug -

[07:27] <xiaomiao> Generating Makefile .................................... FAIL

[07:27] <xiaomiao>     unknown configuration key 'moarshared'

[07:28] <xiaomiao> that error message looks misleading, but I have no idea how to make the whole thing verbose enough so I can understand it

[07:32] <robertle> it's a bug in moarvm 2019.07, a few commits onwards it's fixed

[07:32] <robertle> no fixed release yet though

[07:33] <robertle> its related to --prefix, so if you can live without that then tha's an option as well

[07:41] <xiaomiao> ah

[07:41] <xiaomiao> so it's not my incompetence this time :)

[07:43] <xiaomiao> do you, by chance, know which commit(s) fix that?

[07:44] <robertle> f1b26bb

[07:45] <robertle> I ran into the same problem yesterday with p6bench :)

[07:47] <xiaomiao> good timing :D

[07:56] <xiaomiao> and I found a small bug - if optimize is used the cflags get "-Ono" added

[07:56] <xiaomiao> the 'no' is mildly off :)

[07:56] <xiaomiao> but at least configure mostly works now
