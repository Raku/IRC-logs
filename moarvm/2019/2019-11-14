[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix memory corruption after cancelling signal

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: According to libuv docs, memory MUST only be released once uv_close on a handle

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: runs the supplied callback. Otherwise, uv_run's cleanup will overwrite

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: memory that has already been freed. Therefore we must ensure that we

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: hold on to the async task (and it's SignalInfo structure) until uv_close

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: calls the callback and only then remove the taks from the work queue.

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fixes https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3299

[08:47] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/23daabadc9

[08:50] <nine> It's certainly worth to look at other parts of IO as they may have the same issue with cancellation as ^^^!

[08:51] <nine> (that means someone else should do it, as I'm still on vacation and should get some 2 hours of sleep before going on https://www.darkskyproject.co.nz/tours/summit-experience/ )

[08:52] <nwc10> sleep well

[10:06] <jnthn> (The whole thread, but the tweet I linked is the reason I mention it here)

[10:07] <jnthn> oh, wait, I maybe linked the thread...anyway, the bit about JITs. :)

[19:37] <brrt> I'd prefer testing the real impact over rushing to implement the 'fix'
