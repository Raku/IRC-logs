[10:25] <MasterDuke> timotimo: huh, the gen/* links are working, but e.g., src/Perl6/Compiler.nqp:38 is linking to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/Perl6/Compiler.nqp#L38

[10:26] <timotimo> ah, that has to be nqp, right?

[10:26] <timotimo> oh

[10:26] <timotimo> no, rakudo. but it is moarvm instead

[10:26] <timotimo> example link please

[10:27] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2921

[10:31] <timotimo> updated

[10:40] <MasterDuke> works, timotimo++

[11:48] <timotimo> my first moarvm that asks for confprogs when hitting the profiler is now compiled

[12:01] <MasterDuke> cool

[12:30] <MasterDuke> timotimo: btw, do you remember where i/we left off with trying to time the profiler entering and leaving a block (so we could subtract that time from the profile afterward)?

[12:30] <timotimo> sorry, i don't remember

[12:34] <MasterDuke> hm, and i don't think i committed anything. maybe i stashed some changes though...

[12:36] <MasterDuke> do you know a good way to preview the changes for each stash?

[12:51] <MasterDuke> ah, found my stash

[12:58] <MasterDuke> so `MVM_profile_log_enter(tc, tc->cur_frame->static_info, MVM_PROFILE_ENTER_NORMAL);` is wrong, but anything other than `tc->cur_frame->static_info` as the second option causes segfaults iirc

[13:05] <timotimo> git stash show -u should give the diff

[14:01] <dogbert17> timotimo: you around?

[14:03] <timotimo> now am

[14:04] <dogbert17> have time for a question

[14:04] <dogbert17> ?

[14:05] <dogbert17> I would like to send a PR fro MoarVM, updating libuv to 1.29.1 the latest version

[14:05] <timotimo> sounds good

[14:06] <dogbert17> is it enough to clone my fork of MoarVM, sync with upstream followed by 'perl Configure.pl' to get at the submodules ...

[14:07] <dogbert17> go to libuv dir and checkout v1.29.1, go up to 3rdparty and 'git add' the libuv dir?

[14:08] <dogbert17> have I forgotten anything important? I should add that I have spectested it on my 64 bit Linux and it was clean

[14:09] <timotimo> i think that's it

[14:11] <dogbert17> I'll give it a go then, thx

[14:13] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: dogbert17++ created pull request #1106: Update libuv to version 1.29.1

[14:13] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1106

[14:14] <dogbert17> I hope I did that correctly

[14:16] <dogbert17> I guess we should update libtommath as well ...

[14:16] <dogbert17> although I suspect that might be trickier

[19:22] <timotimo> great idea, calculate the end address of the bytecode to be bytecode_size after the chosen entrypoint

[19:22] <timotimo> no wonder it's been finding lots of NYI ops at the end

[23:38] <MasterDuke> timotimo: think there's going to be a way to call the existing profiling functions as is to get the timing? or think either some sort of flag or new function that's almost identical be added?
