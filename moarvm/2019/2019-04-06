[09:34] <patrickb> .tell brrt Have you seen the gsoc linking proposal?

[09:34] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[09:35] <patrickb> .tell brrt Also did you notice that in rakudo/master the perl6 executable already is no longer a shell script but instead a binary?

[09:35] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[09:44] <timotimo> patrickb: when i try to run perl6-mc it complains that it can't find libmoar.so; did i do something wrong in the installation process?

[09:45] <patrickb> timotimo: Did you run it from the install directory or the build dir?

[09:45] <timotimo> oh, build dir

[09:45] <timotimo> that'd do it, probably?

[09:45] <patrickb> In the build dir it does not work, because the relative path of the libmoar.so is not right.

[09:45] <timotimo> it doesn't actually get installed though? apparently?

[09:45] <patrickb> That's why there are still the .bat runners in the install dir.

[09:45] <patrickb> It is installed as 'perl6'

[09:46] <patrickb> it's just named differently in the build dir to not name-collide with the shell runners.

[09:46] <timotimo> oh, interesting

[09:46] <timotimo> is there any support for the --debug* flags anywhere?

[09:47] <timotimo> if not, could i ask you to whip something up?

[09:47] <patrickb> timotimo what do they do?

[09:48] <patrickb> I think they should work out of the box

[09:48] <timotimo> they'd normally have to be passed to the moar binary itself; --debug-port=1234 will make moarvm listen on a port for debuggers to connect and --debug-suspend will make it stop before running any code

[09:48] <patrickb> see rakudo/src/vm/moar/runner/main.c

[09:48] <patrickb> They should work

[09:48] <timotimo> cool, they do

[09:48] <patrickb> (didn't test, but the code is there)

[09:49] <patrickb> :-)

[09:49] <timotimo> that's very good

[09:50] <timotimo> when did that land? is it in rakudo star?

[09:50] <patrickb> timotimo: I think you should be able to actually run the c-runners from the build dir when setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, NQP_HOME and PERL6_HOME respectively.

[09:51] <patrickb> That's all part of my big relocatable refactor. It was merged shortly after the 2019.03 release.

[09:52] <timotimo> OK

[09:55] <timotimo> i'm glad we finally have this \o/

[09:55] <patrickb> I'm quite proud of this. :-) So many things this unblocks. I hope well soon offer prebuilt .tar.gz / .zip packages on perl6.org.

[09:55] <patrickb> s/well/we'll/

[09:56] <timotimo> the next fun project will be to allow .moarvm files to be put inside the binary itself and be loaded properly

[09:56] <patrickb> That's what the GSoC proposal of brrt is about, right?

[09:56] <timotimo> not entirely sure, but perhaps

[11:27] <patrickb> Could someone have a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1086 ?

[11:27] <timotimo> oh my god nmake

[11:43] <patrickb> I think we should in general tend the PRs a bit better. There are currently 40 open PRs for MoarVM, rakudo has 76. It's rather frustrating to create a PR and then see no one react to it for months.

[11:58] <timotimo> i hear you; i'm already struggling with getting much time into moarvm development in general

[13:33] <dogbert17> jnthn: commit https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/25b486dee8a0f66a944d4a25279de8e7c315807f causes a test failure in t/05-messages/03-errors.t

[13:33] <jnthn> Hm, interesting. Didn't cause any spectest failures, however.

[13:35] <dogbert17> m: *...‚ÄòWAT‚Äô  # that's the failing test, the error message shouldn't contain the word 'SORRY'

[13:35] <evalable6> dogbert17, rakudo-moar c99ae9b32: OUTPUT: ¬´(exit code 1) Potential difficulties:‚ê§    Useless use of ... in sink context‚ê§    at /tmp/b‚Ä¶¬ª

[13:35] <evalable6> dogbert17, Full output: https://gist.github.com/bf8a45dbd2c09dd0a1db91c441e2eaa9

[13:36] <dogbert17> we now get - ===SORRY!=== No such method 'succ' for invocant of type 'Whatever'. Did you mean 'sum'?

[13:36] <timotimo> that's weird

[13:36] <timotimo> how did that become a compile-time error through *that* change?

[13:37] <dogbert17> perhaps my 'bisection' is faulty :)

[13:37] <jnthn> Well, the caller chain is used for backtrace hanlding

[13:37] <jnthn> And we now explicitly try to mark when we should keep it

[13:38] <jnthn> So maybe there's another place, though I can't think where
