[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: it's a bitfield for different debugging flags that

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: confprogs can have; for the instrumented profiler the

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: number 4 is especially interesting, as it outputs the

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: decisions the profiler takes when to run confprog, and

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: when to enter a frame or not based on the values it has

[16:43] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: given so far.
