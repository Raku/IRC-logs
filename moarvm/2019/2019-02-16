[20:42] <timotimo> with the moarperf commits i just pushed the call graph explorer now shows OSR and the two kinds of deopt

[20:44] <timotimo> next is an overview page so it's easy to discover the functions that have some osr or deopt to them

[20:48] <jnthn> Nice :)

[20:49] <timotimo> profiling my SDL2 test thingie makes me want a feature that lets me turn specific functions into "not actually time spent" so it gets subtracted from everything else

[20:49] <timotimo> because SDL_RenderPresent will be doing some sleeping when the renderer has VSync turned on

[20:49] <timotimo> of course, if your program is spending 90% of its time waiting for VSync, that's a good sign for your performance

[20:50] <timotimo> but having every bar in the profiler be shrunk down by that factor is not so great :)
