[12:40] <MasterDuke> i can never remember the link to those daily moarvm benchmarks, anybody have it handy?

[12:43] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: scovit++ created pull request #1039: Allow CStruct pass-by-value in Nativecall

[12:43] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1039

[13:03] <lizmat> MasterDuke: you mean test-t ?

[13:11] <MasterDuke> lizmat: no, there is/was a collection of benchmarks comparing perl5/nqp/perl6 i think that jnthn++ owned

[13:11] <MasterDuke> they used to get updated daily

[13:12] <timotimo> they aren't being updated any more for a long long time

[13:12] <MasterDuke> yep, but do you have the link?

[13:13] <MasterDuke> i'm writing a gsoc proposal that's going to mention them

[13:13] <timotimo> i tried a few things i seemed to recall and couldn't find 'em

[13:13] <timotimo> http://moarvm.com/measurements/perl6-bench/

[13:14] <MasterDuke> timotimo++

[13:15] <MasterDuke> huh, one random day with data in the past year or so http://moarvm.com/measurements/perl6-bench/2018-07-15.html

[19:48] <japhb> MasterDuke: The benchmarks are from https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench (contributions welcome!).  The measurements were jnthn++ just running it as a cronjob, essentially.  Someone doing that again would be nice too.

[21:32] <MasterDuke> japhb: thanks, i updated the proposal a little. and contributing (more) to https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench is on my list of things i'd like to do, there's just the usual problem of not as much time to do so as desired...
