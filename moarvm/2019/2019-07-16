[07:43] <lizmat> perhaps updating Unicode version / other encodings would be a relatively simple task ?

[08:00] <nwc10> IIRC from Perl 5, "updating Unicode version" is rarely a simple task, because some of the stuff that changes needs to be expressed as new code.

[08:01] <nwc10> it was part of why the idea of "just drop in some newer Unicode data files into your old checkout and regen" was actually not going to fly as a "user upgradable part"

[08:01] <nwc10> do "other encodings" change that much to need updating?

[08:06] <lizmat> well, afaik, there's a bunch of encodings that some people would like to see

[08:07] <lizmat> and I guess an EBCDIC one would be cool as well  :-)

[08:17] <nwc10> wash your mouth out!

[08:17] <nwc10> (and technically, "which EBCDIC"?)

[08:18] <nwc10> there were/are at least 2, and they disagree on where '~' is IIRC

[08:18] <lizmat> aaah...so many to choose from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC_code_pages

[08:18] <nwc10> or at least, one of the code points that's happily in one place in ASCII, and is used as a "magic number" for one type of magic in Perl 5

[18:38] <pamplemousse_> I'm running into a bit of a weird error, and was wondering if anyone might have any ideas. When I have my script run the command "perl6 --bytecode <MBC file>, it throws an error here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/compunit.c#L56

[18:38] <pamplemousse_> But if I run "perl6 --bytecode <MBC file>" directly, it's totally fine and executes the MBC file. All the --bytecode flag does differently is open the file in evalfiles and then calls loadbytecode on the compunit.

[18:39] <pamplemousse_> I'm not really sure why there would be a difference between calling "perl6 --bytecode <file>" from within a script and outside a script

[18:46] <brrt> ohai pamplemousse_

[18:47] <pamplemousse_> hi brrt

[18:47] <brrt> pamplemousse_: I'd suggest implementing the "FIXME" error

[18:47] <brrt> not sure if we have something for that yet, but we probably do

[18:50] <brrt> and also, duplicate the line in the script, and put 'echo' in front of it

[18:50] <brrt> see if your script is really pointing to the same file

[18:56] <pamplemousse_> Alright, I'll try those, thank you!

[18:59] <brrt> I don't know if we have a MVM_os_strerror equivalent... we probably should

[19:18] <brrt> did it help?

[19:19] <pamplemousse_> I still don't have it working, no. The script is pointing to the same file, so that's not it. I'm trying to implement the FIXME error now

[19:21] <brrt> Ok

[19:21] <brrt> weird

[19:34] <pamplemousse_> Another weird thing, if in the script I drop the -b flag and use a source file, it doesn't throw an error, but it doesn't output anything either. And it's not an issue where using system() is just not doing anything, because if I chain some other command on the end (I used ls), it definitely outputs that

[19:37] <brrt> okay, I'm wondering what's actually going on with your script

[19:38] <brrt> I think you can run bash in a verbose mode

[19:40] <pamplemousse_> I'm sorry, I used the wrong word. I'm not running a script, I'm running a c program.

[19:44] <brrt> I see

[19:44] <brrt> hmmm

[19:44] <brrt> and, quoting and stuff, is all correct?

[19:45] *** zakharyas joined
[19:47] <pamplemousse_> Yes, as far as I can tell. This is the program: https://github.com/pamplemoussecache/p6_linker/blob/master/attempt2.c#L33

[19:53] * brrt has a look

[19:53] <pamplemousse_> All I've changed between this working and this no longer working was switching to using a file. When I change the command back to using -e and then have it directly plug in the contents of the program (say "Hello world!";), it still works just fine.

[19:54] <brrt> so, couple of points

[19:55] <brrt> - try moving fclose sooner

[19:55] <brrt> before system

[19:55] <brrt> - system is not a production interface for reasons, but let's ignore that for a second :-)

[19:57] <pamplemousse_> Moving it sooner got it to work, sorry, should have caught that. Thanks brrt

[19:57] <brrt> np :-)

[19:58] <brrt> oh, the other thing is

[19:59] <brrt> the template string will be modified, you should copy it to an array (rather than use the pointer to the string constant)

[19:59] <brrt> (the argument to mkstemp, I mean)

[20:09] *** brrt left
[20:12] <pamplemousse_> brrt: Isn't that the desired behavior, that it will be modified? I thought that was the reasoning behind using mkstemp, so that I know the name of the temp file I want to delete after I'm done with it

[20:20] <pamplemousse_> Oh, never mind, I see now. Thank you for your help

[20:21] <pamplemousse_> When I add in the modules, I'll need to make than just the one temp file, so that makes sense
