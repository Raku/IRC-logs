[17:39] <timotimo> finally perl6 admits that prototype-based OO is the best way to go

[17:40] <brrt> I think perl6 was always sort of prototype-based.../

[17:40] <brrt> ?

[17:40] <brrt> I don't actually, really, know

[17:40] <timotimo> well, we've got support for that in 6model

[17:41] <jnthn> Maybe prototype wasn't the best word for that :)

[17:42] <timotimo> "template" :P

[17:45] <timotimo> looking for the right place to put the ".linenumber and .filename on an MVMStaticFrame need a getcodelocation + smart_*ify rather than getattr_o emitted" special case so i don't have to force people to write lineno(sf) or similar in the confprog

[17:48] <timotimo> one of the design considerations of the language was "no need to make it too user friendly", though

[19:26] <Kaiepi> are compound literals allowed or not? i was wondering since they're c99

[19:27] <Kaiepi> like void *foo; bar(&(char)(foo))

[19:27] <Kaiepi> *&(char){foo}

[19:50] <ugexe> isnt the codebase c89?

[19:53] *** brrt joined
[20:00] <timotimo> yeah, we're supporting MSVC

[20:00] <timotimo> it's got most of c89

[20:05] *** brrt left
[20:07] *** brrt joined
[20:13] <dogbert17> jnthn: it's quite possible that some spectest failures are due to the RAKUDO_FIRST_FLAG problem. I didn't see that fix in your branch.

[22:54] <timotimo> good morning jnthn :)

[22:54] <jnthn> :)

[22:54] <jnthn> Didn't sleep yet ;)

[22:54] <jnthn> Figured I'd get that bit of relatively easy code churned out tonight so I can look at the trickier things tomorrow

[22:55] <timotimo> i just figured out that if i put a stringification thing into the confprog, that'd naively entail allocation of mvm objects :|

[22:59] <jnthn> d'oh, yes

[22:59] <jnthn> What do you need to stringify?

[22:59] <timotimo> integers :)

[22:59] <timotimo> but just for log output

[23:00] <timotimo> so log can just grow a variant that understands integers, and one that can understand nums

[23:00] *** Kaiepi left
[23:01] <timotimo> anyway, confprog can now decide based on a static frame's code location as getcodelocation defines it

[23:01] <timotimo> i.e. look at the first annotation and take the file name and line number of that

[23:02] <jnthn> ooh, nice

[23:02] <timotimo> that's probably the only thing of interest for profiling

[23:44] <timotimo> confprog is speculated to perhaps get support for C strings, fwiw. so stringification of ints and nums isn't off the table

[23:44] <jnthn> Ah, this is telling: with a small nursery and GC debug on I replicate loads of those assertion failures dogbert17 mentioned earlier. But if I disable JIT they go away.

[23:44] <jnthn> Certainly I'm too tired to work out what exactly is going on there

[23:45] <jnthn> But it's a good clue for tomorrow

[23:45] <jnthn> Curiously, I don't think I changed anything JIT-y in my branch, so I've probably uncovered an existing bug

[23:46] <timotimo> quite probably

[23:46] <timotimo> will be interesting to see

[23:46] <timotimo> i'm pretty glad today was a cold and rainy day

[23:51] <jnthn> It became rainy here in the afternoon and cooler than it has been

[23:51] <timotimo> nice

[23:52] <jnthn> Absolutely hammered it down, filled the drains, and the water in my office toilet started trying to escape :P

[23:52] <jnthn> (It failed, thankfully.)

[23:52] <timotimo> oh yikes

[23:52] <jnthn> Plenty of gurgling/splashing noises, but no mess.

[23:53] <jnthn> sleep time o/

[23:54] <timotimo> gnite jnthn!
