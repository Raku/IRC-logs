[13:13] <patrickb> samcv: I've seen your PR. Great! I have just one more request, could you split it up into two files and add two entries to README.md? That'd be great!

[13:14] <timotimo> how long until the project suggestions have to be finished?

[13:19] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline

[13:19] <AlexDaniel> so a day or two before Feb 6th?

[13:20] <timotimo> thank you

[13:26] <patrickb> 6th is the google deadline

[13:26] <patrickb> 4th is the one we set up to have some time to clean up things

[13:26] <timotimo> OK

[14:51] <timotimo> brrt, you're not at fosdem, right?

[14:51] <timotimo> brrt, the talk Right Now is "faster programs with guile 3", which i believe includes talk about a jit

[18:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1043: Jit (open|read|close)_dir

[18:46] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1043

[18:53] <timotimo> btw what more than an extra queue of reference addresses and a little bit of API do we need to actually have weak references in moarvm?

[18:54] <timotimo> i'd imagine once we're through with the regular queue, we'd go through the list of weak refs and if the target has a forwarder update the pointer, otherwise redirect to VMNull for instance

[19:26] <timotimo> maybe i should just prototype

[21:41] <timotimo> i guess it'd become problematic if you pass a weak reference to a sub and during binding the gc kicks in and what used to be some value is now null

[21:42] <timotimo> though if there's only, for instance, a WeakHash, it'll only ever change from one nqp::atkey to another - though have fun with existskey, ugh

[22:04] <timotimo> ehhh, too lazy to add a compose protocol to VMHash
