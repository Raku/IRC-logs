[21:32] <jnthn> timotimo++ # nice blog post and work :)

[21:32] <timotimo> thank you! \o/

[21:48] <vrurg> jnthn: BTW, I finally done M#1209 the way it had to be. It is ready for merge.

[21:48] <synopsebot> M#1209 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1209 Fix run-away CORE context on closures

[21:49] <vrurg> timotimo: I described the problem in the PR. Nothing really specific, the biggest problem was my lack of expertise in moar. :)

[21:55] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM/master: 4 commits pushed by (Vadim Belman)++, (Jonathan Worthington)++

[22:00] <vrurg> jnthn: thanks!

[22:00] <jnthn> vrurg++

[22:05] <timotimo> super good!

[23:01] <timotimo> so

[23:01] <timotimo> when a callback comes from a thread moarvm knows nothing about

[23:02] <timotimo> how are we going to figure out which MVMInstance it should belong to?

[23:02] <timotimo> since we kind of have support for multiple MVMInstances in one process

[23:02] <jnthn> I'm not sure there's any good way to solve that.

[23:02] <timotimo> nqp::claimprocess()

[23:03] <jnthn> Right, you'd have to designate one instance

[23:04] <jnthn> In terms of how people use MoarVM today, I don't think that's going to be a practical problem

[23:04] <timotimo> indeed
