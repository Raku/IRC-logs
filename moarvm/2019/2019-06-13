[21:10] <ugexe> timotimo: i wonder if https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2fe2f588fd931e9bed982da97f352207ddab9e62#commitcomment-33930846 will avoid the need for that conditional

[21:11] <timotimo> not sure if it can help for the conditional, but it can surely be used ni one of them. maybe they have more optimized code than we do, surely they have better maintained code than we have for this task :)
