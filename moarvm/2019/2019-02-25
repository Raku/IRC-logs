[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: 682ca82f5f | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/core/nativecall.c

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix nativecall refresh clearing used child object pointers

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: We compared the address of the struct member pointing to a child object with

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: the address of the actual child object. Of course this cannot match, so we

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: ended up clearing the child_objs slot all the time. This caused us to garbage

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: collect e.g. a CArray object that was still pointed to by the CStruct.

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: merge_bbs was deactivated in commit d9a0dd8bf5c9d3ffa2518caf460135d3857d751f

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: because it broke the preds. We now fix up those preds and have them point

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: to the newly merged bb instead of the removed one. With that in place, we can

[21:35] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: re-enable merge_bbs
