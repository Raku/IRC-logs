[00:21] <MasterDuke> timotimo: did you do anything with malloc_trim()?

[00:52] <timotimo> ah, sorry, i haven't yet

[00:52] <timotimo> what did i even do today ...

[00:55] *** zakharyas joined
[01:05] <MasterDuke> ah. if you or anybody else hasn't looked into it more in the next couple days i might get a chance to take a look again

[01:06] <MasterDuke> but too tired right now to do anything constructive, off to watch some of the second season of the punisher

[08:04] <brrt> thank you lizmat, I responded :-)

[08:05] <nwc10> good *, brrt

[08:11] <brrt> good * nwc10

[08:11] <brrt> what if the expression JIT IR is really too small

[14:33] <Guest27580> jnthn: perhaps you missed it but here's a gist showing a test which fails on the moar-pea branch, it's almost certainly the same as the one uncovered by nwc10: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/e6b0d0030b2b9c1d459f2b9513d780cd

[17:33] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo, et at.: i've tried putting a malloc_trim(0) in a couple different places in finish_gc() https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/gc/orchestrate.c#L132 , but keep getting a segv when profiling. any suggestions?

[23:34] <MasterDuke> jnthn: did you happen to catch my earlier question about malloc_trim() and the GC and profiling?

[23:39] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Saw it, but no idea; didn't even glance what malloc_trim is for yet

[23:41] <MasterDuke> jnthn: no hurry or anything. the experimentation and subsequent question was inspired by https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2019-03-14-what-causes-ruby-memory-bloat.html#a-magic-trick-trimming

[23:41] <jnthn> Hmm...what's the goal of calling this?

[23:42] * jnthn wonders how effective that'd be...

[23:43] <jnthn> Our FSA and GC pools keep hold of everything they ever asked for :)

[23:43] <jnthn> I guess if one had big amounts of stuff in malloc'd memory like buffers it maybe helps, but it sounds vulnerable to fragmentation stopping it doing much still?

[23:44] <jnthn> What does the SEGV look like?

[23:44] <MasterDuke> well, that example that samcv was talking about a little while ago, of run()ing a cat of a file in a loop uses a bunch less ram

[23:45] <MasterDuke> according to /usr/bin/time

[23:45] <jnthn> Hm, interesting

[23:45] <jnthn> http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc_trim.3.html claims it's thread safe, which was gonna be my first guess

[23:46] <MasterDuke> jnthn: some info here https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/moarvm?date=2019-03-15#l15

[23:47] <MasterDuke> afk for a little bit

[23:47] <jnthn> Hmm, is profiling broken without this? :)

[23:48] <jnthn> Just to sanity check

[23:48] <jnthn> Also, does it blow anything up (tests, spectest, etc.) without profiling?

[23:48] <jnthn> It feels odd that profiling would cause this

[23:48] <jnthn> And nothing else

[23:48] <MasterDuke> jnthn: haven't run a spectest yet. but nqp and rakudo do compile ok

[23:49] <MasterDuke> oh, that example may break under profiling anyway...

[23:49] <jnthn> OK, where'd you put it? inside the `if (is_coordinator)` is the sensible spot, I think

[23:54] <jnthn> Sleep time :) o/
