[14:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: 10 commits pushed by (Jonathan Worthington)++

[14:06] <jnthn> rebase :)

[14:06] <yoleaux> 15 Apr 2019 23:58Z <patrickz> jnthn: I attempted a fix for the runners in the build dir not working. What I found out: They were dependent on CWD and only worked with CWD = build dir. The install path was and still is included as a lib dir in those runners, because they need NQP which is located in the same dir. I changed the include order though, so the files in the build dir are preferred.

[14:06] <yoleaux> 15 Apr 2019 23:58Z <patrickz> jnthn: I put the changes in https://github.com/patzim/rakudo/tree/fix-build-runners

[14:44] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: Add interpretation of some new unboxed bigint ops

[14:44] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ac9fa0655e

[14:44] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: JIT the new unboxed big integer operations

[14:44] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/cbe7ff1646

[14:48] <jnthn> Neat, given the program:

[14:49] <jnthn> my $x = 64;

[14:49] <jnthn> my int $o;

[14:49] <jnthn> for ^20_000_000 {

[14:49] <jnthn>     my int $i = ($x + 1) * 2;

[14:49] <jnthn>     $o = $o + $i;

[14:49] <jnthn> }

[14:49] <jnthn> say $o;

[14:49] <jnthn> It eliminates the Int allocations for the + and * results

[14:49] <jnthn> Meaning that we get rid of all of the allocations

[14:49] <jnthn> (Once spesh has run)

[14:50] <jnthn> And thus run in under half the time

[14:51] <jnthn> Still some work to do on this stuff, but nice to see it can have some benefit :)

[14:53] <patrickb> ls

[14:53] <patrickb> ugh ww

[14:54] <jnthn> Though making this really useful in practical cases will mean making our EA really be PEA :)

[15:11] <tadzik> nEAt

[15:17] <jnthn> Also, if I translate that into Perl 5 (get rid of int, etc.) then Perl 6 seems to run it 3 times faster; note that the + and the * are big integer upgrading operations (though in this case never need to upgrade, but we still must check...) producing boxed Ints, which is what we now optimize away.

[15:17] <jnthn> So that's fairly promising

[15:17] <tadzik> that's really good:)

[15:19] <Guest2775> jnthn: will your current work be able to improve R#1421 ?

[15:19] <synopsebot> R#1421 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1421 [performance] Sieve of Eratosthenes 42x slower than Perl 5

[15:29] <jnthn> Would at least help a bit, yes

[15:29] *** patrickb left
[15:29] <jnthn> Though it may already be faster than when that measurement was done :)
