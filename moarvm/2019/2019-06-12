[13:30] <ugexe> GB2312 is still missing

[13:35] <patrickb> But GB2312 is already worked on by a GSoC student.

[20:02] <brrt> good *

[20:02] <pamplemousse> \o

[20:02] <brrt> pamplemousse: how are you doing

[20:02] <brrt> :-)

[20:04] <pamplemousse> I'm doing alright! Finishing up my progress update. I realized I made a silly mistake with the ELF header information which is part of the reason why it wasn't calling Moar as the interpreter. So I'm a little closer, which is good

[20:05] <pamplemousse> How are you doing?

[20:06] <brrt> Cool. I'm doing pretty well. Rainy, cold day today, which is a nice refresh from the hot and damp that was last week

[20:06] <brrt> Unfortunately I found out that my car is leaking from the underside :-(

[20:06] <pamplemousse> Same here, as far as weather goes. It's been a nice change of pace

[20:07] <pamplemousse> That's no good! Hopefully it's not too difficult to fix

[20:18] <brrt> I have a suspicion what the problem is, and it should be under warranty

[20:18] <pamplemousse> That's good, hopefully it works out

[20:19] <brrt> Yes, but I've lost some of my trust in the dealer, since I sent it back for this exact problem before

[20:19] <brrt> Oh well

[20:19] <brrt> We'll see

[20:20] <brrt> MoarVM-wise, I've sort-of fixed generic types in the expression precompiler

[20:20] <brrt> and I recently learned how to use yacc. Or bison.

[20:20] <brrt> And I want to apply that somewhere

[20:24] <pamplemousse> Yacc looks neat. Never used it, but it looks interesting

[21:02] <brrt> it's a fairly cranky old C tool

[21:02] <brrt> but it's also very useful

[21:04] <timotimo> it's also got a funny name

[21:04] <yoleaux> 10:43Z <jmerelo> timotimo: perl6-gtksimple is failing because the location for the dlls is hardcoded: https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple/issues

[21:04] <yoleaux> 10:45Z <jmerelo> timotimo: you seem to be the last one who's worked on that, so you might know how to fix it...
