[10:38] <Guest23744> jnthn: thx, do you want a new PR with static added?

[10:39] <jnthn> Yeah, it seems there's a few things in inline.c that need it

[10:39] <nwc10> good *, jnthn's throat!

[10:39] <Guest23744> oh hello nwc10

[10:39] <jnthn> Basically, anything without an MVM_ prefix wants it

[10:40] <Guest23744> cool, I can probably fix that unless someone beats me to it

[20:48] <tellable6> 2019-09-23T02:46:19Z #perl6-dev <vrurg> patrickb Could you, pls, test R#3194? It's another big revamp, for NQP this time. It coincided with your NQP_HOME changes and caused collisions which I had to resolve manually and wanna make sure I missed nothing.

[20:48] <synopsebot> R#3194 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3194 [WIP] Further improvements to the build process

[20:51] <patrickb> I'd like to write three functions to wrap open/_wopen, fopen/_wfopen and stat/_wstat and use them throughout the code. Idea is to use the versions that do proper encoding on Windows. Where would I put such wrappers?

[20:51] <patrickb> src/io/io.c?

[20:53] <patrickb> When do I need to use MVMROOT? Those functions will use MVM_malloc and MVM_free to reserve a local variable of appropriate size to hold an encoded path.
