[16:22] <Kaiepi> at some point in the future i'm thinking of auditing moarvm and using unveil(2) on openbsd wherever applicable to help make it more secure

[16:22] <Kaiepi> thoughts?

[16:22] <Kaiepi> this explains what pledge(2) and unveil(2) do, though pledge is pretty useless in our case https://www.openbsd.org/papers/BeckPledgeUnveilBSDCan2018.pdf

[16:22] <timotimo> sounds like a good idea

[16:26] <Kaiepi> if moar were split into separate processes for networking, file i/o, and stuff pledge would be useful, but atm it's not so i'd just be enabling everything with it

[16:28] <timotimo> i haven't heard of unveil yet

[16:29] <Kaiepi> it's new to openbsd 6.4 i think

[16:29] <Kaiepi> which is the current stable version

[16:30] <Kaiepi> 6.5 is coming out soon, which is what i'm running

[16:37] <patrickb> Kaiepi: I don't fully understand your last comment in r#2818

[16:37] <yoleaux> 6 Apr 2019 23:10Z <jnthn> patrickb: GitHub organization invite sent; once you accept it you should have commit access. Welcome! :)

[16:37] <synopsebot_> R#2818 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2818 [BSD] Cannot run perl6 without using LD_LIBRARY_PATH on OpenBSD

[16:37] <Kaiepi> gimme a sec patrickb, i'm in the middle of building rakudo for another issue i'm posting

[16:37] <patrickb> no hurry

[16:41] <timotimo> ok, so calling unveil once will make the entire filesystem except for one path disappear, and then you can put paths back with a limited rwxc

[16:50] <Kaiepi> yep

[16:54] <Kaiepi> the difference in performance is pretty huge with MVM_JIT_DISABLE, to say the least

[16:54] <Kaiepi> i'm still building rakudo

[16:54] <Kaiepi> good work, jit team

[17:09] <Kaiepi> i don't mean that passive-aggressively, it's just one op jitted recently screwing things up that's making me use MVM_JIT_DISABLE

[17:13] *** AlexDani` joined
[17:14] *** AlexDaniel left
[17:16] <ugexe> what is he mystery op?

[17:16] <ugexe> the^

[17:17] <ugexe> you'd probably have to look at MVM_SPESH_LOG=log.txt output after it blows up

[17:18] *** domidumont joined
[17:20] <Kaiepi> i'll find out when rakudo finishes building

[17:29] <Kaiepi> ugexe, how do i tell which op is to blame? there are several expr bails

[17:30] <ugexe> i'd grep out the ops that bailed, filter to unique ops, then post the list from which i imagine we can identify any that were recently added

[17:31] <ugexe> i dont know if this will actually work

[17:31] *** AlexDani` left
[17:33] <ugexe> (MVM_SPESH_LOG=log.txt perl6 -e '...') && (cat log.txt|grep bail > log2.txt) && perl6 -e '.say for "log2.txt".IO.slurp.lines.map({ $_.match(/\s*(\w+) /)[0].Str }).unique.sort'

[17:33] <ugexe> i dug that out of my bash history

[17:45] <Kaiepi> ugexe, R#2824

[17:45] <synopsebot_> R#2824 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2824 Cannot install zef (or run much of anything without MVM_JIT_DISABLE)

[17:49] <ugexe> hmm nothing sticking out. since it seems possibly file related i would take a guess that reverting https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/e1dc1b399459881f29afa38454ff99259df30667 and rebulding moar might be worth a shot

[18:03] <Kaiepi> ugexe, doesn't work

[18:04] <Kaiepi> unveil(2) could possibly be responsible if something required to run perl6 uses it

[18:05] <ugexe> you might have to manually bisect to figure it out

[18:06] <ugexe> which i generally do by just reverting some commit halfway between last release, make install, run script to see if its still broke, then repeat

[18:06] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: does it work if you just use MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE ?

[18:06] <ugexe> its not `make install` for moarvm doesn't require rebuilding anything else

[18:06] <ugexe> s/not/nice/

[18:08] <ugexe> s/reverting some commit/resetting to some commit/

[18:11] *** MasterDuke left
[18:11] <Kaiepi> .tell masterduke no it still segfaults

[18:11] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: I'll pass your message to masterduke.

[18:11] <Kaiepi> .tell masterduke er, trace trap

[18:11] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: I'll pass your message to masterduke.

[18:13] <Kaiepi> for me it rebuilds everything whenever i reset to another commit ugexe

[18:13] <Kaiepi> guess it depends on which make you're using

[18:22] <ugexe> `make install` inside /MoarVM rebuilds rakudo (which is in another directory)?

[18:23] <ugexe> i didnt expect the makefile to be aware of that

[18:47] <Kaiepi> oh not rakudo

[18:47] <Kaiepi> just moarvm

[18:47] <Kaiepi> wait am i supposed to rebuild nqp and moarvm after doing changes like reverting the fileno_fh jit templates ugexe?

[18:48] <ugexe> just moarvm

[18:48] <Kaiepi> ok good because i didn't

[18:49] <Kaiepi> i reaaalllly don't wanna manually bisect two different bugs on code that spans across three repos

[18:49] <Kaiepi> i might write a script that takes a piece of code and does it for me

[18:51] <ugexe> the number of repos is spans does not matter unless you encounter a commit that required an nqp bump

[18:51] <ugexe> because you are just rebuilding moar and nothing else

[18:52] <Kaiepi> the file errors may or may not be a bug in nqp or rakudo, i'm not sure yet

[18:52] <Kaiepi> the trace trap i know is a legojit bug so it's not as annoying to bisect

[18:56] <ugexe> well whatever it is happens during precomp

[18:56] <ugexe> which creates files

[18:57] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/51455df9b1b25b8e9a503ff264ce18ca954aaa47/src/core/CompUnit/PrecompilationRepository.pm6#L263-L286

[18:57] <ugexe> perhaps you can use that to golf something

[19:16] *** domidumont left
[19:31] <timotimo> the stacktrace from things called by the jit is usually completely unusable. as in, even when you think you see something in it, it's probably just leftovers/garbage that'll totally mislead you given the chance

[21:02] *** zakharyas left
[22:12] <Kaiepi> i figured, timotimo

[22:13] <timotimo> i can recommend rr to figure out what happens, but i'm not sure it runs on bsds

[22:13] <timotimo> though rr isn't the only recording/replaying framework around, right?

[22:45] *** patrickb left
[22:58] <ugexe> werent you saying something about using unveil or something now?

[22:59] <ugexe> are you sure that 2019.03 worked under whatever conditions you have now?

[23:00] <ugexe> because what appears to me is that rakudo cant write to its site or home repositories

[23:00] <ugexe> when its trying to precomp

[23:00] <ugexe> and i'm not aware of anything since 2019.03 that should affect that
