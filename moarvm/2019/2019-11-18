[09:47] <tellable6> 2019-11-18T03:21:44Z #raku-dev <vrurg> jnthn I have removed the new batch call ops in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3199 and extended WALK functionality. Would be great if you review it so I could possibly finally merge it.

[11:39] <Guest13443> releasable: next

[11:39] <releasable6> Guest13443, Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. 248 out of 479 commits logged (âš  9 warnings)

[11:39] <releasable6> Guest13443, Details: https://gist.github.com/621bc4233831daafbea36a6e5e3e2cf7

[11:40] <Guest13443> so who's doing the release, samcv, jnthn or someone else?

[11:41] <jnthn> I glanced at doing it at the weekend, but the release procedure got a bunch more involved since I last did it

[11:41] <jnthn> (I'll need to get set up for signing and stuff)

[11:48] <Guest13443> sounds complicated

[11:50] <jnthn> Not terribly, just needs more time than I had available

[14:35] <samcv> jnthn, i can do the signing

[14:35] <samcv> but can't do the changelog stuff

[14:36] <samcv> so if the changelog can be commited then i can do the release, but i don't have the time to put the changelog together

[14:37] <samcv> Guest85410, i see your post in #raku-dev. that would be super appreciated

[22:20] <brrt> .tell dogbert17 there's a bunch of 'revert revert revert'.... that can be coalesced into 'fixed ...' :-)

[22:20] <tellable6> brrt, I'll pass your message to dogbert17

[22:44] <dogbert17> brrt: I take it that the exprejit implementation of sp_p6oget_bi finally went in :)

[22:45] <dogbert17> is it enough if I keep the last commit hash

[22:48] <brrt> yep
