[08:31] <rfold> nine: you mentioned using start instead of Thread.start, what's the difference that causes one to work and not the other?

[08:37] <nine> rfold: Thread.start starts a genuinely new thread for the sole purpose of running the block you pass it. After that the thread is stopped again and garbage collected. start { } schedules the block on the thread pool. The thread pool's threads are retained and re-used.

[08:37] <rfold> Thanks. Should this be documented in perl6/doc?

[08:37] <nine> rfold: I'd say so, yes
