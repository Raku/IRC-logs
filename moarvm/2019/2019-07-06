[02:15] *** MasterDuke left
[02:18] <Kaiepi> so wide strings on moarvm requires setting the locale with newlocale/uselocale/freelocale (and whatever's used on windows)

[02:18] <Kaiepi> should the locale be set each time a thread starts or should it only be set and cleared when the locale's needed?

[02:20] <Kaiepi> the functions i mentioned are threadsafe btw, and can set the locale to whatever the system uses

[09:29] <MasterDuke> dogbert11: i've been getting a bunch of fails in what appear to be random test files when i set MVM_GC_DEBUG=1 and MVM_NURSERY_SIZE=8192. i haven't been able to repro any particular fail, but i suspect they're just new appearances of whatever causes https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3030

[09:29] <MasterDuke> but maybe you can dig something new up

[12:43] <dogbert11> .

[13:17] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: I'm get plenty of failing spectests when running with a 16k nursery, quite many as a matter of fact

[13:17] <dogbert11> *I'm getting ..

[13:17] <timotimo> oof

[13:18] <dogbert11> all of them vanishes if I set MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[13:20] <MasterDuke> i suspect a single root cause (though i have absolutely no idea what that is)

[13:21] <dogbert11> hmm, I might have to take that back. I'm sloppy it seems, after rebuilding Rakudo the number seems to go down quite a bit

[13:21] <timotimo> ah. it happens :)

[13:21] <dogbert11> grrr :)

[13:22] <dogbert11> I was playing around with jnthn's frame-opts branch yesterday and forgot to rebuild rakudo after going back to master

[13:23] * dogbert11 changing the nursery to 8k just like MasterDuke

[13:24] <timotimo> better escape analysis could also make spec test runs with small nurseries just a little bit less horrible :)

[13:25] <dogbert11> btw, I believe that the third gen Ryzen CPU's will be released tomorrow

[13:25] <dogbert11> in case someone is thinking of building a new system

[13:28] <MasterDuke> i am. and luckily ram prices have dropped a bit

[13:30] <MasterDuke> my desktop isn't scheduled to arrive (along with the rest of the household goods) for another couple weeks. maybe i'll just buy the stuff beforehand and only have to set it up once

[13:31] <dogbert11> what are you going to buy?

[13:33] <MasterDuke> 3700X

[13:36] <dogbert11> is that the 8-core 65W TDP model?

[13:37] <MasterDuke> yeah

[13:39] <dogbert11> very cool

[13:43] <dogbert11> are you getting a X570 MB as well?

[13:44] <MasterDuke> i think that makes sense, since i need a new MB anyway

[13:45] <MasterDuke> there don't appear to be massive difference, but they aren't horribly more expensive either

[13:47] <dogbert11> you get PCI4 which might possibly come in handy

[13:53] <MasterDuke> yeah. i don't think i would go out and buy an X570 if i was given something else. but since i have to get something new anyway, might as well future-proof as much as i can

[13:53] <dogbert11> after running a spectest with an 8k nursery I got ~10 spectest failures

[13:55] <dogbert11> one test hung and I had to kill it. t/spec/S07-slip/slip.t

[13:56] <dogbert11> several sockaet related test files failed as well but I believe that we have reported those already

[13:56] <ugexe> whatever the current flapper on appveyor is (06-struct ?) also goes away wih MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[13:57] <ugexe> that one seems to have started earlier this year

[13:59] <dogbert11> ugexe: that test fails om my RPi

[14:00] <ugexe> does it fail with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 ? hopefully they are related

[14:05] <dogbert11> let me investigate

[14:13] <dogbert11> sigh, now it doesn't want to fail anymore (grumble)

[19:49] <brrt> \o

[19:52] <timotimo> yo

[19:55] <brrt> turns out that type systems are subtle business, who would've guessed

[19:55] <timotimo> ha

[19:55] <timotimo> ain't that the truth

[20:09] <Kaiepi> so i'm on the last step of implementing wide string support on moarvm, which is dealing with locales

[20:10] <Kaiepi> should i set the locale globally with setlocale or individually for each thread with newlocale/uselocale/freelocale?

[20:10] <Kaiepi> the latter is thread-safe

[20:12] <Kaiepi> alternatively i can only set the locale while wide strings are being used

[20:12] <timotimo> that sounds much more sensible, even if multiple locales in the same process isn't necessarily common

[20:13] <Kaiepi> aight
