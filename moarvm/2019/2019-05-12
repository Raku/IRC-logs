[07:26] <timotimo> can we "just" have a segv handler that outputs a stack trace?

[08:07] <nine> A Perl 6 or a C stack trace?

[08:07] <yoleaux> 03:36Z <SmokeMachine> nine: https://github.com/FCO/Red/tree/master/lib/Red/AST

[08:22] <timotimo> perl6 stack trace usually

[08:23] <timotimo> C would be possible with libunwind; we'd also want to make the jit's stack be a little less confusing for this possible

[08:23] <timotimo> purpose*

[13:36] <timotimo> i wonder if we have any functions that take an array and try to use its data while another thread could potentially be resizing it, for example
