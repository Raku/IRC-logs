[16:45] <dogbert17> oh, an incredible amount of action :)

[16:47] <dogbert17> where are all the c experts?

[16:51] <dogbert17> I'm wondering if this line is correct: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/nativecall_dyncall.c#L575

[16:52] <dogbert17> how common is it to calculate 'sizeof(something *)' ?

[17:01] <timotimo> whenever you have an array of arrays you want to malloc, that's one spot

[17:02] <dogbert17> and this spot?

[17:03] <timotimo> i'm sure DCpointer is already a pointer-like, but it does look just a little strange

[17:04] <dogbert17> yeah, how to figure out if it's correct or not?

[17:04] <timotimo> hum. can have a look at the dyncall documentation perhaps

[17:06] <dogbert17> http://www.dyncall.org/docs/manual/manualse8.html says that DCPointer is 'void*'
