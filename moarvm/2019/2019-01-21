[07:52] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[07:54] <nine> .tell jnthn To reproduce run: `time perl6 csv-ip5xs.pl < /tmp/hello.csv` from Tux' CSV repository and compare Inline-Perl5's master branch to the inline-demonstration branch (1 commit difference). I do not think that it's JIT related. Feels more like inlining will push the inliner's size over the inline limit and we'd benefit from that much more. Or so.

[13:39] <MasterDuke> this is probably a better spot for this question. anyone have an idea why this patch https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/a618b3e46db4f7ea9fac78d984af2d3e would cause `Unable to allocate an array of 4607182418800017409 elements` when building NQP with my make-int-default branches?

[13:42] <nwc10> 4607182418800017409 is 0x3ff0000000000001

[13:42] <nwc10> completely guessing here, but there's an internal representation choice, isn't there, for some sort of ints (but I forget which) to either be a pointer to a bigint, or the actual int stored inline

[13:42] <nwc10> is it getting confused by that, somehow?

[13:43] <nwc10> I repeat, "completely guessing here"

[13:43] <nwc10> but that bit pattern is strange.

[13:46] <brrt> hmmm

[13:46] <brrt> no idea :-(

[13:51] <MasterDuke> looks like set_size_internal was called with 4607182418800017408 (and then internally adjusts to the number reported), so 0x3ff0000000000000, but that doesn't help me

[13:56] <MasterDuke> hm, maybe something is getting upgraded from 32-bit to 64-bit?

[13:57] <nwc10> it's more likely to be 16-bit to 64-bit

[13:59] <brrt> hmm yeah

[13:59] <MasterDuke> if it helps, here's the full error https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/2b956e1316fca0024b0d7bd07facd838

[14:00] <timotimo> nwc10: that representation is internal and should never become visible at all :)
