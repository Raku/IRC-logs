[22:44] <Kaiepi> jnthn, in case you still remember about offering to review the ipv6 pullreq i made earlier this week, i wouldn't do it until i redo some of the refactoring i did because i made some wrong assumptions about how sockets work in c when writing it

[22:44] <Kaiepi> at least i think it was you that offered to, i can't really remember off the top of my head

[22:51] <timotimo> brrt, expr-jit-invoke, is that branch still of interest at all?

[22:59] <jnthn> Kaiepi: OK, ping me when you want to. I've had a lot less energy/time this week than I'd have hoped.

[23:00] <timotimo> i went on emergency shutdown for the past two days

[23:00] <jnthn> timotimo: Hope it helped and you're feeling a bit better now

[23:00] <Kaiepi> same, actually
