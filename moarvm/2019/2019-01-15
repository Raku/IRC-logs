[11:40] <lizmat> timotimo: looked at it, didn't see anything weird except of course the conflict (s_foo... vs MVM_foo... identifiers)

[11:40] <lizmat> no idea how to fix that

[11:41] <timotimo> looked at what?

[11:42] <timotimo> what are s_foo?

[11:43] <lizmat> the conflicts in the PR

[11:43] <lizmat> 1034

[11:43] <timotimo> oh, that one

[11:50] <timotimo> since we're blocking a libtommath release and they're hoping to get into the latest debian freeze, i'd say we should unblock their process ASAP

[12:13] <brrt> I haven't looked at it timotimo

[12:15] <brrt> timotimo: I can rebase and merge it if you want

[12:16] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[12:43] <timotimo> https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/pull/147 - i wrote a comment on one of the issues, of which there are three :P

[13:00] <jnthn> nwc10: Yes; it was fixed early this morning. Although the coffee machine still had water in its tank, so bootstrap wasn't threatened either way... :-)

[13:00] <yoleaux> 14 Jan 2019 22:45Z <lizmat> jnthn: I created the candidate to handle "my %s is Set[Int]", but I have **no** clue as to how to get the parameterized set into position

[13:01] <nwc10> hurrah for offline storage - water that's not in the cloud.

[13:05] <nine> Water that's not in the cloud.....wait...

[13:06] <nwc10> I left out some implementation details about the bit between the cloud and the tap - exercise to the reader to fill in the bits about reservoirs, water treatment plants, pumping stations, whatever.

[13:12] <lizmat> don't forget the rivers!  :-)

[13:13] <jnthn> Given you're not allowed to sell fish caught in the Vltava, I think I *will* forget that river when it comes to sourcing my drinking water :P

[13:17] <lizmat> isn't that not  more about preservation than health ?

[13:18] <brrt``> dunno, czech republic has been heavy-industry champion of central europe for a long time

[13:18] *** brrt`` is now known as brrt

[13:24] <lizmat> true, but so has the Ruhrgebiet.  But if you go there now, you'd be amazed how much it has changed since the 60-80s

[13:24] <lizmat> anyways, it's all water under the bridge  :-)

[13:26] <nwc10> lizmat: I did forget them. And the pipes. Lots of tubes.

[13:39] <nine> Wow, that's surprising. Apparently there is no way at all to interrogate a perl6 process about the --libpath options in use. They are handled by MoarVM internally only.

[13:46] <brrt> that may be an omisssion

[13:49] <lizmat> nine: also not part of nqp::getcurhllsym('$COMPILER_CONFIG') ?

[13:49] <jnthn> Probably nobody ever needed it (yet :))

[13:50] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::getcurhllsym(q/$COMPILER_CONFIG/)<libdir>

[13:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar eb50d8cef: OUTPUT: «"/home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share"␤»

[13:51] <lizmat> I guess that's not it ?

[13:51] <nine> There are so many libs and directories. The libdir from compiler config is something else again.

[13:52] <lizmat> but I guess it should be in there: nqp::getcurhllsym(q/$COMPILER_CONFIG/)

[13:52] <nine> Everything surrounding library paths has a very ad-hoc feeling to it. Which is probably how it came to be :)

[13:53] <nine> nine@beta:~> perl6 -e 'use nqp; say nqp::getcurhllsym(q/$COMPILER_CONFIG/)<libdir>'

[13:53] <nine> /usr/share

[13:53] <nine> lizmat: ^^^

[13:53] <nine> nine@beta:~> nqp --show-config | grep nqp::libdir

[13:53] <nine> nqp::libdir=/usr/lib64/nqp

[13:53] <lizmat> urgh

[16:51] <timotimo> and i've copy-pasted the necessary changes from pull request M#1034 into the source and i'll commit it soon

[16:52] <samcv> i have now found an apartment in amsterdam. still so much left to do

[16:56] <samcv> yes! found a nice 3 bedroom with balconies on both sides of the apartment. Amsterdam Oost

[16:57] <samcv> and my stuff by ship has been delayed until feb 22. so i need to decide what to do regarding that

[16:59] *** domidumont joined
[16:59] <samcv> i brought a bed in my shipping container. so. maybe i will just buy one and put the one i have in the guest room. i don't know

[17:08] <samcv> the first apartment i was at today. no elevator and 5th floor. stairs were about 45 degree angle in slope

[17:08] <samcv> very nice apartment and lots of space. but it's not a walk. it's a climb

[17:09] * timotimo has not-so-fond memories of his own apartment search

[17:10] <brrt> hehe

[17:10] <timotimo> when you said you found one, i thought you had perhaps already signed a contract; are there many other people interested in that particular apartment?

[17:10] <brrt> well, you have no reason to complain. I live in arnhem, I have to climb 60 meters every time I head to the city and back

[17:10] <samcv> ah. well i got confirmation and sent my passport job contract etc

[17:10] *** patrickb left
[17:11] <samcv> there was another person who wanted it. but they had no sent in all the required details. now i must wire some money and then sign the contract on the 22

[17:11] <timotimo> brrt: you're saying it's a climb both ways? :P

[17:11] <samcv> but it is mine

[17:11] <samcv> provided i do what i just mentioned

[17:12] <samcv> now i need to do all furniture, light fixtures and washer and dryer. internet connection. probbaly many other things. but glad i found this place with the help of the relocation service

[17:12] <brrt> hehe, that was ambiguous grammatically

[17:13] <samcv> i believe they said it was barred to students. as it has 3 bedrooms there would be very many people probably :)

[17:13] <samcv> thinking of having a guest room, an office and then master bedroom

[17:14] * brrt is a little jealous

[17:14] <timotimo> hello a little jealous, i'm timo

[17:14] <samcv> it's a little less m² than some other i saw, but the balconies, being on the 1st floor with storage area in basement, plus quiet street but a major shop street close by

[17:14] <samcv> only one i saw out of the 5 i saw today i was like. ok this could be it

[17:15] <timotimo> how's the distribution of electrical sockets? in my apartment it's rather terrible

[17:15] <samcv> it was just renovated and now is A energy. so insulation and thick windows, wood floors. lots of sockets and lan

[17:16] <timotimo> nice

[17:16] <samcv> 1450 a month, so not bad for what it is

[20:38] <brrt> \o

[20:38] <brrt> so, minor issue of the day

[20:39] <brrt> the 'rax' register is unallocatable by the register allocator

[20:39] <lizmat> .oO( bRAXit )

[20:39] <brrt> brcxit

[20:39] <brrt> brbxit - which is nonvolatile

[20:39] <brrt> ehm. It is the 'spare register' for the JIT compiler....

[20:40] <brrt> Anyway, minor issue resolved; I need to start storing that spare register

[20:40] <brrt> rather than leaving it implicit
