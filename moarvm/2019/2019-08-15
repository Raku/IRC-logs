[08:28] <cygx> o/

[08:29] <cygx> is update_ops.p6 broken for anyone else?

[08:29] <cygx> it generates garbage for MVM_op_get_mark() in core/ops.c

[09:05] <jnthn> Pretty sure I used it a few weeks back without trouble.

[09:12] <cygx> last change to the script was in May, so I guess I'll have to figure out what's wrong on my end...

[21:31] <timotimo> didn't continue much last night, and today i didn't have any productivity in me at all

[21:38] <timotimo> i was even too bleh to profile the little hilbert curve impl i ported from wikipedia that was much too slow

[21:39] <MasterDuke> i've been mildly inspired to start the cleanup of my barrett implementation to prepare it for a libtommath PR

[21:40] <timotimo> i also haven't been able to think more than a tiny bit about that

[21:43] <timotimo> m: say 100 / 17.85

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: ¬´5.602241‚ê§¬ª

[21:43] <timotimo> 5.6 frames per second just calculating

[21:45] <MasterDuke> i haven't been able to drum up the effort to figure out how to make it non-recursive, or integrate the barrett reduction functions already present, but i figure some of the other stuff i can do, e.g., code formatting, add to the makefile

[21:47] <timotimo> m: say 100 / 1.4

[21:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: ¬´71.428571‚ê§¬ª

[21:47] <timotimo> that's better

[21:47] <timotimo> change from "for 1, 2 ... $n" to "while $s < $n {" ... " $s *= 2; }"

[21:49] <MasterDuke> nice

[23:27] <timotimo> jnthn: can i have your opinion on the thing i discovered yesterday where the logged values that "turn getlexbyinvtype into constant value" optimization uses appear not-right?

[23:29] <jnthn> timotimo: Please ask tomorrow; I'm still a bit under the weather and should go to sleep soon :(

[23:30] <jnthn> (And seriously, do nudge me about it again tomorrow, 'cus I'm liable to forget.)

[23:45] <timotimo> no prob!
