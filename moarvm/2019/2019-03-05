[15:42] <yoleaux> 03:16Z <Xliff> jnthn: What's the best way to debug requests when using Cro::HTTP::Client? I need to verify certain headers are being sent when performing a POST

[15:42] <jnthn> .tell Xliff CRO_TRACE=1 in the environment

[15:42] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to Xliff.

[15:42] <jnthn> I'm remember putting that in the docs, but nobody reads docs :D

[15:43] <jnthn> .oO( maybe they assume nobody writes docs... :) )
