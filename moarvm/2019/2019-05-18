[01:21] <ugexe> looks like moarvm changes in master might have broken rakudo make test?

[07:53] <brrt> I'm going to get rid of `reg_type` in the linear scan allocator

[07:55] <brrt> oh hang on, reg_type means something differnet than I thought it di

[08:05] <brrt> I mean, reg_spec

[08:58] <timotimo> soon windows will ship a linux kernel, then debugging will be easier :P

[15:53] <pamplemousse> Hi! I'm currently trying to reproduce this issue: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1068 and when I run the gdb command referenced in the issue, I get a message saying, "Reading symbols from /home/madeleine/sandbox/perl6/install/bin/moar...(no debugging symbols found)...done." I configured MoarVM with the --debug flag when I was setting everything up, do you guys have any ideas what I'm missing in trying to reproduce

[15:53] <pamplemousse> this?

[16:02] <timotimo> pamplemousse: bin/moar usually has barely any debug symbols, but libmoar.so will have a load of 'em

[16:03] *** ggoebel joined
[16:05] <timotimo> the most important is that you get names, filenames, and line numbers when you "bt"

[16:05] <timotimo> annoyingly, you can't put in breakpoints before the program has started

[16:09] <timotimo> well, you can. you just have to click through a prompt every time

[16:09] <timotimo> and you don't get tab completion

[16:13] <pamplemousse> Thank you! Using libmoar.so worked.

[16:17] <MasterDuke> pamplemousse: looks like i didn't need to in this case, but you often need to disable the jit (e.g., MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 gdb ...) to get good backtraces

[16:24] <pamplemousse> Getting a bit further, but it doesn't get to .gdbinit. I'm not super comfortable with gdb so it might be that. I needed chmod $HOME/perl6/install/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm and $HOME/perl/lib/libmoar.so but now get the symbols read.

[16:26] <timotimo> that's a little odd

[16:26] <timotimo> i'm not sure the ".gdbinit: running app" message is necessary

[16:26] <timotimo> what do you mean it "doesn't get to" that?

[16:26] <MasterDuke> how did you build moarvm?

[16:29] <pamplemousse> The .gdbinit: running app message doesn't happen and it doesn't start up any of the threads and I can't backtrace. I'm executing the equivalent gdb command for: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1068

[16:29] <timotimo> do you perhaps have to "run" before anything happens?

[16:30] <timotimo> oh!

[16:30] <timotimo> you know, if you have a very up to date rakudo, you don't have to have the long command

[16:30] <timotimo> and in fact

[16:30] <timotimo> it may not work

[16:30] <timotimo> i believe the new runner will forward --full-cleanup for you from the perl6 command

[16:31] <timotimo> so maybe this works: gdb --args perl6 --full-cleanup -e 'blah blah code here blah'

[16:31] <pamplemousse> MasterDuke: From the head of the current source for MoarVm with ./Configure.pl --prefix="appropriate prefix" --debug; make install

[16:31] <timotimo> i often not only --debug but also --optimize=1 or even --optimize=0 so that debugging gets easier

[16:32] <MasterDuke> or --debug=3

[16:32] <timotimo> i'm not actually completely certain if that makes a difference (but i do pass it always)

[16:33] <pamplemousse> I'll try that, thanks

[16:36] <timotimo> BBL

[16:49] <pamplemousse> MasterDuke: Are you currently able to use the gdb command from #1068 to reproduce the same output? This is my output: https://pastebin.com/4SRLf2Ae

[16:52] <MasterDuke> pamplemousse: did you type 'run' in gdb?

[16:55] <pamplemousse> I did and I got an unhandled exception: index start offset out of range at gen/moar/main.nqp:1

[16:57] <MasterDuke> i changed the command to `gdb --args /home/dan/Source/perl6/install/bin/perl6 --full-cleanup -e 'for ^2 { my $cmd = run « echo 1 », :out; $cmd.out.close }'` and it works

[16:58] <MasterDuke> but i now get `Unhandled exception: Cannot find method 'name' on object of type Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW` instead of the segv

[16:59] <MasterDuke> but valgrind still complains about `invalid read` and `Process terminating with default action of signal 6 (SIGABRT): dumping core`

[17:01] <MasterDuke> woah! if i configure moar with --valgrind i get tons of errors

[17:02] <pamplemousse> Just tried running the command again and I'm now getting the same unhandled exception command as you

[17:03] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit, but it looks like you're making progress now

[17:04] <pamplemousse> Thanks for your help!

[17:08] <pamplemousse> Grabbing lunch, BBL
