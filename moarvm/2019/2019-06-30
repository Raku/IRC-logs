[06:07] <samcv> AlexDaniel, i could do it. also good morning

[06:08] <samcv> probably. i'm a bit under the weather right now. when does it need to be done

[07:53] *** sena_kun joined
[09:58] <AlexDaniel> samcv: likely not today, maybe tomorrow or in two days

[09:58] <AlexDaniel> samcv: fwiw there's also this discussion: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/53

[10:00] <AlexDaniel> samcv: but in rakudo we'll soon start a release branch I think, so do it when you feel alright

[10:12] <samcv> AlexDaniel, okay. great :)

[13:20] <MasterDuke> hm, when does one want to use MVM_6model_get_debug_name vs MVM_6model_get_stable_debug_name ?

[14:01] <timotimo> jnthn: if you want to hear something fun, the return value decont spesh plugin commit is implicated in a bug where something supply-related accidentally returns a low-level object (i forgot which) into sink context

[14:02] <timotimo> that's what dogbert11 talked about yesterday, S17-supply/return-in-tap.t

[14:34] <jnthn> Yeah, saw that; doesn't make terribly much sense...

[14:34] *** patrickb left
[14:35] <jnthn> I'm suspecting something race-y, just not sure where it could be.

[14:36] <timotimo> race-y, huh

[14:37] <timotimo> i hadn't considered that

[15:14] <jnthn> When compiling MoarVM HEAD I see some warnings...

[15:14] <jnthn> src/profiler/configuration.c: In function â€˜validate_opâ€™:

[15:14] <jnthn> src/profiler/configuration.c:273:51: warning: format â€˜%dâ€™ expects argument of type â€˜intâ€™, but argument 3 has type â€˜MVMuint64 {aka long unsigned int}â€™ [-Wformat=] MVM_exception_throw_adhoc(tc, "STRUCT_SELECT string length %d (index %d) NYI or something", string_length, string_idx);

[15:27] <dogbert11> jnthn, timotimo: bisecting this was quite difficult given that you sometimes have to wait a quite long time for the error to occur. So there's a chance that the last working commit, i.e. 523ffae84 might fail if run for long enough time.

[15:28] <dogbert11> but I did let it run in one terminal while running a spectest using all cores in another and it didn't break

[15:29] <dogbert11> and since I'm on AMD Ryzen I'm unable to use rr

[16:00] <timotimo> d'oh, i never get warnings about format strings

[16:01] <japhb> timotimo: Did you see my Terminal::QuickCharts link over on #perl6-dev?  You're one of the people I thought might have fun with that (despite that right now it's really incomplete, there's just enough to show the concepts and do basic stuff)

[16:02] <timotimo> that's why i keep pushing commits that have them >_<

[16:02] <timotimo> japhb: i have not, and i'm only at the keyboard for a little moment, but it does sound interesting!

[16:02] <japhb> Well, if you do get a couple minutes, feedback welcome.  It's not ready for ecosystem yet, but early feedback appreciated.  :-)

[16:31] <timotimo> why are there no screenshots, why do i have to run the code myeslf? :P

[16:31] * timotimo afk again

[16:32] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: d6f9e02bae | (Daniel Green)++ | src/profiler/configuration.c

[16:32] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix format string warnings

[16:32] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d6f9e02bae

[16:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo: just fixed the warnings

[16:54] <japhb> .ask timotimo What's the typical protocol for screenshots these days?  Some static image files in examples/ with links from the README?  Or is there something else I should use?

[16:54] <yoleaux> japhb: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[17:01] <timotimo> tbh i don't have a good suggestion :(

[17:01] <yoleaux> 16:54Z <japhb> timotimo: What's the typical protocol for screenshots these days?  Some static image files in examples/ with links from the README?  Or is there something else I should use?

[17:01] <timotimo> it's not great that the screenshots - if they are in the git repository - have to be downloaded every time the module is installed (if it's in the ecosystem rather than cpan)
