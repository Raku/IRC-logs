[09:11] <timotimo> tracy is supposedly able to record millions of "zones" per second. we could literally have it record every single allocation in a user's program

[09:12] <timotimo> and of course every entry/exit into/from frames, though that requires instrumentation just like the profiler has

[09:30] <brrt> right

[09:30] <brrt> re: C-stack and stack-frame useage;

[09:30] <brrt> *usage

[09:30] <brrt> I think that luajit also uses the C stack, and it also support coroutines

[09:30] <brrt> so it shouldn't be impossible to do

[09:31] <brrt> then again, luajit is all-the-way assembly
