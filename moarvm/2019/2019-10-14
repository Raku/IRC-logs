[13:18] <nine> :)

[13:19] <nine> jnthn: do you still know what code looks like? ;)

[13:19] <jnthn> Yes, I'm not quite *that* management yet :)

[13:20] <jnthn> .oO( What am I thinking?! )

[13:21] <jnthn> I guess the next code I "should" be writing in MoarVM is to try and finish up the current round of EA stuff, though is...scary :)

[13:22] <nine> Yeah, that's what I'm always telling myself, too...

[19:12] <timotimo> just added "search for objects with a ref named 'foo'" to moar-ha and moarperf

[19:13] <timotimo> just tried it with "search for all objects that have a reference named '$_'

[19:13] <timotimo> it's obviously useful to look for variables

[19:26] <nine> dogbert17: unfortunately there seems to be a regression from my NativeCall work that I need to look into
