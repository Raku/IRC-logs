[11:06] <brrt> \o

[11:11] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[11:11] <jnthn> Happy New Year :)

[11:12] <lizmat> jnthn brrt o/

[11:15] <timotimo> o/

[11:16] <timotimo> the muldis object notation grammar may be a good benchmark for building big NFAs

[11:17] <timotimo> as i just posted on #perl6, it spends a lot of time in mergesubrule, mergesubstates, and optimize

[11:19] <timotimo> that said, the subs in question aren't necessarily very slow; about 9.6 us per call, it's just that they get called 800k times in this particular case

[11:19] <timotimo> addedge is called 1m6k times

[11:19] <timotimo> optimize on the other hand only gets called 77 times, but spends 40ms per entry

[11:20] <timotimo> from the looks of the progress bar thingie, optimize is like a quarter or a fifth of total program run time

[11:20] <timotimo> (this is not the qast optimizer, it's the nfa optimizer)

[11:24] <timotimo> oh, one thing to point out is that it's at 30% time spent in GC

[11:25] <nine> addedge doesn't use any native types at all

[11:26] <nine> Happy new year btw. :)

[11:26] <timotimo> happy new year nine :)

[11:26] <timotimo> or as people at the XXc3 tend to say: merry crisis and a happy new fear

[11:27] <timotimo> allocations-wise, BOOTInt is the second place, with the top entries being: optimize (6.5m), addedge (1.6m), mergesubrule (0.8m), dentout (!) (0.8m), insert_bytecode (11k)

[11:28] <timotimo> the number 1 allocated type is NQPArray, though: mergesubstates (4.5m), optimize (1.8m), mergesubrule (0.8m), addstate (0.8m), op (239k)

[11:28] <timotimo> oops

[11:28] <timotimo> that last one was supposed to be 29k

[11:28] <timotimo> the cat wants me on the sofa :D

[11:28] <timotimo> bbl

[11:31] <brrt> happy new year jnthn, nine, timotimo

[11:31] <brrt> and lizmat of course :-)

[11:31] <lizmat> :-)

[11:48] <timotimo> happy new year brrt, jnthn, lizmat :)

[11:49] <lizmat> timotimo o/

[11:49] <timotimo> oh, i neglected to continue looking at the allocations list

[11:50] <timotimo> the next one in the list is BOOTNum with 6.2m total allocations. compare that to BOOTInt with 9.9m and NQPArray with 8.1m allocations total

[11:50] <timotimo> it stands to reason that we'd want to eradicate almost all BOOTNum in compilation

[11:52] <timotimo> allocators of BOOTNum are: mergesubstates (4.5m), optimize (1.6m), isa (23k), sanity_check (3k), capnames (1k), rxjump (980), unique (560), visit_children (360)

[11:52] <timotimo> and a bunch more that are smaller

[11:56] <timotimo> the GC tab shows a bunch of distinct "phases" when looking at percentages promoted: first a couple of runs with 15% promoted, then about 100 runs with 30% promoted (very stable), then 20 runs with 100% promoted (100% stable), 15 with ~50% promoted, a few noisy ones, then another 100 runs of 30% promoted, then 100% again, then ~50% again, the rest is noisier

[12:00] <timotimo> oh wow

[12:00] <timotimo> i didn't see that until i got the flame graph, but

[12:00] <timotimo> mergesubstates and mergesubrule recurse *pretty* deep

[12:01] <timotimo> about 50 frames between the two of them

[12:03] <timotimo> nine: are you already looking at changes to addedge's code?

[12:08] <nine> timotimo: no, have to earn some money instead :)

[12:09] <timotimo> damn :)

[12:11] <jnthn> Lunch time for me :)

[12:50] * timotimo sprinkled some native types all throughout NFA.nqp, hoping they are all correct %)

[12:52] <lizmat> timotimo: any idea why that wasn't done before ?

[12:52] <lizmat> was it because they didn't exist yet when that part of NQP was written ?

[12:54] <lizmat> just OOC

[13:04] <timotimo> not sure; that code is probably very old and not touched very often

[13:05] <timotimo> i wish it weren't as hard to see where nqp floats and where it ints

[21:07] <dogbert11> hah, so I've managed to repro the 'continuationinvoke expects an MVMContinuation' bug on my Linux system as well. So it's not only a RPi problem.

[21:08] <dogbert11> the bad part is that it only shows up if the system is heavily loaded

[21:25] <timotimo> sounds like you may want to try something that fiddles with thread scheduling

[21:25] <timotimo> rr has something for that, i believe

[21:25] <dogbert11> the sad thing is that Ryzen CPU's and rr don't mix very well :(

[21:26] <timotimo> is that still an issue? :<

[21:26] <timotimo> does rr work on hack? on the whateverable server?

[21:27] <dogbert11> dunno

[21:29] <dogbert11> turning off spesh does not help

[21:29] <MasterDuke> pretty sure it does on the whateverable server, think i've used it there before

[21:31] <timotimo> does it actually have multiple threads?

[21:31] <timotimo> i think it's a crash related to the thread pool scheduler?

[21:37] <dogbert11> what has multiple threads, the test?

[21:37] *** leont left
[21:38] <timotimo> yeah, whatever process crashes

[21:45] <dogbert11> at least we can't blame this bug on jnthn's latest merge :)
