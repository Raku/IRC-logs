[07:15] <nine> brrt: I'd be grateful for any such hints! My understanding of the JITs control flow is limited

[07:15] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to brrt

[15:12] <nine> Guest38485: I don't need advent calendar puzzles. MoarVM supplies me with a steady flow of the greatest puzzles and mysteries that want solving :)

[20:48] <nine> No progress today :/

[20:51] <nine> I do have some suspicion...that tc->cur_frame ends up pointing to the wrong frame as it never had a spesh_cand but we're in JITed code anyway

[20:54] *** sena_kun left
[20:56] <nine> That tc->cur_frame gets set by NativeCall's callback handler: tc->cur_frame = backup_cur_frame;

[20:57] <nine> I.e. that's the frame that called the native code that ran the callback

[22:54] *** sena_kun left
[23:44] <jnthn> nine: Hmm...I wonder if it could be something like a deopt all causes an uninlining, creating a new top frame, and then it restores backup_cur_frame to the wrong thing. That doesn't quite match the symptoms though...
