[11:37] <timotimo> hmm. learn more about signal handling so i can make sure heap snapshot writing won't get interrupted in the middle of a "blob"?

[11:38] <timotimo> perhaps a signal handler that reacts to sigint by saying "send sigint again to immediately terminate" and otherwise would finish up the littlest bit of code before aborting

[11:38] <timotimo> or mask sigint for the duration of a piece of work, i imagine the signal handler would "immediately" trigger after the signal is unmasked?

[11:41] <timotimo> probably something i should worry about ... later :)

[11:47] <brrt> :-)

[11:53] <timotimo> so moarvm now writes the new heap snapshot format, at least i think it does :D

[11:53] <timotimo> and i've got a slript that reads one zstd stream and gives back what was left in the input buffer so parsing can continue there

[14:18] <Guest2775> timotimo, jnthn: any theories as to what might be happening here https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/f902f4a8d0c8e1b2958fcdc227eeaa17

[14:23] <jnthn> Guest2775: Looks like a premature free, maybe

[14:37] <Guest2775> jnthn: it's this piece of code https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/074d0da6bf29eaf78a9d9c57745dd191

[14:38] <Guest2775> in the shell script (9999999.sh) I have added a 'sleep 25' line in order to hit the timeout logic in the script

[14:39] <Guest2775> perhaps it has something to do with the sig handlers mentioned in the line 'whenever signal(SIGTERM).merge: signal(SIGINT)'
