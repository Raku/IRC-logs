[06:39] <samcv> .tell dogbert11 i'm not getting those valgrind errors you are

[06:39] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to dogbert11.

[06:41] <samcv> i will try compiling with gcc instead of clang and then try again

[06:44] <samcv> there's an error in the code though

[06:53] <samcv> it should just be optimized out i'd think. but there's some extra variable definitions that shouldn't be there

[14:26] <jnthn> o/

[14:32] <[Coke]> o)

[14:38] <timotimo> ooh, the variables were entirely unused, that's why in more optimized builds there was no null pointer deref

[14:38] <timotimo> dang, i could have thought of that :D

[14:40] <dogbert2_> seems a bit dangerous to assume that the dangerous/broken code will be optimized away though

[14:42] <timotimo> if null pointer deref is deemed undefined behaviour, then it's absolutely fine for the compiler to do whatever it feels like

[15:14] <[Coke]> is there a way to get a 64bit build of moarvm on windows?

[15:15] <timotimo> aren't the only builds on windows we have 64bit

[15:15] <timotimo> ?

[15:16] <[Coke]> just noticed my local build is reporting 32 bit in taskmgr.

[15:16] <timotimo> oh

[15:17] *** squashable6 left
[15:20] <timotimo> not actually sure how to work msvc, but i'd start with the appveyor file

[18:23] <samcv> dogbert2_, well. it's more a thing of the variable being defined in an outer context. but not used in outer scope. but it's defined again in an inner scope with same name

[18:23] <samcv> so i don't think it should be used... unless i'm missing something. which is possible
