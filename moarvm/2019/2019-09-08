[09:19] <MasterDuke> timotimo: src/profiler/heapsnapshot.c:73:9: error: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code [-Werror=declaration-after-statement]   73 |         MVMuint8 i;

[09:27] <MasterDuke> oh, that line looks unused. but if you remove it then you get the same error about `MVMHeapDumpTableOfContents *toc = MVM_calloc(1, sizeof(MVMHeapDumpTableOfContents));`

[10:17] <dogbert17> hmm, I wonder if 'Zeroed owner in item added to GC worklist' could be some kind of fromspace error in disguise

[10:20] <dogbert17> I get it when running t/04-nativecall/13-union.t with a small nursery (768 bytes) and it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/f396ed9afcea140cf24ca27f26227232

[12:12] <timotimo> thanks MasterDuke  i'll go fix that

[12:12] <timotimo> my compiler was supposed to explode on that

[12:13] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: fix "mixed code/declaration" error

[12:13] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/289e9dfcec

[12:17] <MasterDuke> huh, mine did

[12:17] <MasterDuke> but doesn't now

[12:17] <timotimo> glad to hear

[12:17] <MasterDuke> gcc (GCC) 9.1.0

[12:35] <dogbert17> timotimo: are you less distracted today, i.e. are you working on your grant?

[12:35] <MasterDuke> any reason not to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1164 ?

[12:36] <MasterDuke> or https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1145 ?

[12:39] <MasterDuke> or https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1167 ?

[12:46] <timotimo> dogbert17: i didn't start yet, because i was distracted :|

[12:46] <timotimo> but i want to do grant work today if possible

[12:46] <timotimo> did you have some burning questions? :)

[12:46] <timotimo> haha

[12:46] <timotimo> the internet connection broke

[12:46] <timotimo> so i connected to the router's web interface

[12:47] <timotimo> while i was waiting for it to appear, i switched over to irc to read and answer

[12:47] <timotimo> not realizing that that means the internet connection is back

[12:48] <MasterDuke> heh. did you simultaneously ask where your glasses were while wearing them?

[12:48] <timotimo> quite

[12:48] <timotimo> but kind of more like someone put the glasses on my head while i was looking for them

[12:55] <MasterDuke> timotimo: can i use `MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free` to free `MVMGrapheme32 *buffer`?

[12:56] <dogbert17> timotimo: I have no burning questions atm :)

[12:57] <timotimo> MasterDuke: sure, it just calls MVM_free on the pointers you pass

[12:58] <MasterDuke> cool. i sort of assumed so, but all the uses i've seen in the code are with `char *`

[12:58] <timotimo> right, because the reason the function exists is because you can't free those before you call the exception throw function, because they are used in the format string, but you also can't free them afterwards because the exception throw function doesn't return

[13:00] <MasterDuke> i think i'm going to go the _free route to address https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1139#discussion_r304626105, but i guess i'm surprised nobody else has ever used anything other than chars

[13:03] <timotimo> using the _free variant will allow you to have ("%02x %02x %02x", buffer[pos - 2], buffer[pos - 1], buffer[pos])

[13:06] <timotimo> BBL

[13:08] <MasterDuke> .tell brrt if you don't get github notifications, i replied to your comments in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1139

[13:16] <MasterDuke> whoops, `MVMGrapheme32 *waste[] = { buffer, NULL };` does not make the compiler happy

[13:21] <MasterDuke> interesting. the conflicting types isn't the main problem

[13:21] <MasterDuke> src/strings/utf8.c:387:21: error: a label can only be part of a statement and a declaration is not a statement  387 |                     MVMGrapheme32 *waste[] = { buffer, NULL };

[16:00] <MasterDuke> how do you get a perl6 backtrace if you ctrl-c in gdb?

[16:02] <MasterDuke> oh, i think i just had an old alias, now it works if i just start perl6 manually with gdb

[16:02] <timotimo> call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)

[17:15] <tellable6> 2019-09-07T22:25:17Z #moarvm <jnthn> brrt I've looked at deopt a few times and figured there's a simplification to be had. Probably also a memory saving since we only use a fraction of the deopt points we potentially might need.

[17:15] <tellable6> 2019-09-08T13:08:51Z #moarvm <MasterDuke> brrt if you don't get github notifications, i replied to your comments in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1139

[17:15] <brrt> jnthn: I'm working on making the deopt use the index... that will simplify the implementation of guards as expression templates

[17:16] <brrt> which becomes entirely nonspecial, at that point

[17:17] <brrt> but... at least one place is messing with my assumptions

[17:18] <brrt> also, there's a bunch of places in which we could save a bunch of memory by using bitmaps, I think

[17:34] *** MasterDuke joined
[17:55] <brrt> I tweaked all known places where we insert sp_guardconc ops into using the index, yet I get one that's using the code offset like before
