[18:07] <dogbert17> hmm, MoarVM panic: Corrupt multi dispatch cache: cur_node != 0, re-check == (nil)

[18:08] <dogbert17> looks as if R#2261 is still present

[20:58] <brrt> \o

[21:16] <MasterDuke> it's been pretty quiet in here the past week or so

[21:23] <brrt> yep

[21:27] <MasterDuke> but you're a good person to ask. https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1212 look good?

[21:28] <brrt> will look

[21:30] <MasterDuke> it was causing a 'jit bailed completely' in `my @alts = ^256; my $a; $a = "127.0.0.1" ~~ /^ @alts ** 4 % . $/ for ^300; say $a`

[21:40] <japhb> MasterDuke: Shouldn't that be % '.' ?  In other words, don't you need to quote the dot?

[21:41] <MasterDuke> japhb: yeah, but this is an awful way to verify ip addresses anyway. it's just code from a bug report

[21:42] <MasterDuke> that i think was just meant as an example of interpolating arrays

[21:42] <japhb> Ah, gotcha
