[00:02] <SmokeMachine> im getting the error "MoarVM panic: Trying to unwind over wrong handler" on a code that was working...

[00:03] <timotimo> oh, would be interesting if you could bisect it or something

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: how could I do that?

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> I was trying t4o golf...

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> but without luck...

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/NVUwznNk/

[00:05] <timotimo> is that a run-time error? i.e. what does --stagestats output?

[00:06] <SmokeMachine> timotimo:  https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uJDH6zsb/

[00:07] <SmokeMachine> i think its related to a .resume on a custom control exception... but couldn't golf that...

[00:16] <timotimo> i haven't played with custom control exceptions yet at all

[15:13] <jnthn> Wow, so many more symbols visible in the debugger for NQP now :)

[15:13] <timotimo> awesome

[15:14] <jnthn> And no missing symbols from Perl 6 code

[15:14] <jnthn> (Due to the lowering)

[15:14] <jnthn> Neat

[15:15] <jnthn> Now we won't ship a Rakudo release that makes debug stuff worse just days after the Comma release that makes debug stuff better :P

[15:15] <jnthn> Should help those debugging Perl 6 and NQP in the command line tool also

[15:16] <timotimo> how much bigger does it make the core setting?

[15:17] <jnthn> Didn't measure yet

[15:17] <jnthn> Though I expect "not hugely", because we were storing all the variable names in ContainerDescriptors anyway on the string heap

[15:17] <jnthn> And each debug entry is 6 bytes

[15:19] <jnthn> I'm also wondering if we should disable inlining when in debug mode

[15:19] <jnthn> Since it can't cope with it properly (couldn't before, and still can't now)

[15:19] <jnthn> Or maybe that's already done...

[15:19] <timotimo> i don't think it does that yet
