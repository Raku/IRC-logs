[14:25] <Guest38485> not a massive amount of activity here taoday

[14:32] <lizmat> well, jnthn, apart from not feeling 100%, is busy IRL with non-Raku things

[14:33] <lizmat> nice non-Raku things that will make his life better  :-)

[14:33] <Guest38485> aha, that sounds good

[16:17] <japhb> Yeah, good to hear.  Extended quiet from a regular is always a bit worrisome, and it really seems like a fair chunk of the core team has been pretty overwhelmed by life the last few weeks at least.

[16:29] <timotimo> ^- that's me

[16:29] <timotimo> ("nice non-raku things that will make his life better" sounds like adopting kittens)

[16:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Kaiepi++ created pull request #1214: [IP6NS Grant] Clean up and make MVM_io_resolve_host_name more portable

[16:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1214

[16:35] <Kaiepi> hoping i can get redoing the changes worth keeping from that pr over with asap because the next step of the grant is UDP and UNIX socket support for IO::Socket::INET

[16:36] <Altai-man_> Kaiepi++ # /me often notices how people ask about UDP / unix sockets support

[16:37] <Kaiepi> :)

[16:39] *** zakharyas left
[16:40] <Kaiepi> UDP sockets just need splitting the listen op into bind and listen ops and creating ops for sendto and recvfrom to work, which shouldn't be *too* much work to do

[16:40] <Kaiepi> UNIX sockets just need support for using null hostnames on top of that afaik
