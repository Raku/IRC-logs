[13:51] <MasterDuke> what's the printf format string for an  MVMnum64?

[13:51] <yoleaux> 29 Jan 2019 06:49Z <nine> MasterDuke: I remember lots of +@some_arr in NQP code. In fact I think that that's the most common use of prefix:<+>. This use case would benefit from intification for sure.

[13:56] <jnthn> %d (for double), I think

[14:06] <MasterDuke> heh, that's what i thought, but i didn't understand the values actually printed. guess i need to figure out where/why they're happening

[14:06] *** patrickb left
[14:07] <MasterDuke> i'm back to trying to make prefix:<+> intify in my NQP branch instead of numify. rakudo builds ok, but fails a bunch of spectest

[14:16] <MasterDuke> wait, isn't it %lf ?

[14:21] <jnthn> oh, hang on....

[14:22] <jnthn> I dunno why I wrote %d, that's for integers :(

[14:22] <MasterDuke> those seem to make a little more sense

[14:22] <jnthn> It's %g :)

[14:22] <jnthn> But I think %lf works too

[14:22] <jnthn> Sorry, doing 5 things at once doesn't work so well :)

[14:22] <MasterDuke> np, thanks. i've never seen %g before

[15:17] <MasterDuke> oh hey! i think it's now passing all tests and spectests on my branches including prefix:<+> intifying
