[11:59] <pamplemousse> Hi brrt

[12:00] *** reportable6 left
[12:00] <brrt> hi pamplemousse

[12:00] *** reportable6 joined
[12:00] <brrt> how are you doing

[12:01] <brrt> just fyi, I'll be travelling in the next week, so my online time will be limited

[12:01] <brrt> (I hope to get some MoarVM hacking done nevertheless)

[12:01] <pamplemousse> Alrighty. Have fun travelling!

[12:02] <pamplemousse> I'm a bit stuck. Post should be incoming in the next hour or so on where I am so far, but I've been having a pretty hard time with figuring out how to get the modules working.

[12:03] *** lizmat_ joined
[12:04] <pamplemousse> I'm having two main issues, the first is that while I can get the initial list of necessary modules, I think I'm missing the dependencies that the modules themselves may have.

[12:05] <pamplemousse> The second issue is that I'm still having a hard time identifying how to point perl6 at the place I'm putting the modules.

[12:05] <brrt> hmmm. It may be the case that the modules you load are precompiled

[12:05] <brrt> the second issue, I may be able to help with

[12:07] *** lizmat left
[12:07] <pamplemousse> I think I should be able to sort out the first issue. They definitely are precompiled, and each of them begin with a couple of strings which I think may be the names of files that they depend on.

[12:08] <brrt> uhuh

[12:08] <pamplemousse> If you have any pointers on the second issue, I would greatly appreciate them

[12:08] <brrt> I'm checking now... :-)

[12:12] <brrt> pamplemousse: my theory is this... in rakudo (src/core/CompUnit) there's a role CompUnit::Repository

[12:12] <brrt> and it's implemented by a bunch of scripts

[12:12] <brrt> eh, other roles

[12:13] <brrt> like CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem, CompUnit::Reposity::NQP, etc

[12:14] <brrt> and there's CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry

[12:15] <brrt> and I *think* that you'd need to have a CompUnit::Repository::HardLinked (or something), initialized with the current file (the argument to 'bytecode'), and have it registered at runtime

[12:20] <pamplemousse> Hmmm.

[12:23] <pamplemousse> Currently, if I package up a user program that uses modules without those modules, and just try to run it to see what happens, it can't find the modules either. My gut feeling based on looking at the files you've pointed me at is that there's something I'm not accounting for happening in CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry, but I'm not sure

[12:23] <pamplemousse> I'll keep poking around

[12:32] <brrt> good luck
