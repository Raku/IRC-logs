[10:15] <nwc10> jnthn: forgot to say - our cellar is somewahat chaoatic. Yesterday I discovered that some plonker had left an empty crate of beer bottles blocking the beer fridge. How silly.

[10:23] <jnthn> Oh deer

[10:23] <jnthn> *dear

[10:23] <jnthn> hah

[10:23] <jnthn> I read it as "a crate of empty beer bottles"

[10:24] <jnthn> Apparently my brain auto-corrects for pessimism...

[10:24] <nwc10> acually, your brain corrected it to what I meant to type to be clear

[10:24] <nwc10> the crate had all slots full with empty beer bottles

[10:24] <nwc10> to be clear, the good news was that once removed, the beer fridge could be opened and was *not* itself emptya

[10:25] <nwc10> and also, there is another crate which has some beer in it still, with which to restock the fridge

[10:25] <nwc10> It is good that today is Friday, because I appear to be in need of a weekend

[10:26] <jnthn> :)

[10:26] <jnthn> Here we order groceries online, and they will take away empty beer bottles (at least, the redeemable ones) and credit the account for it with the next shopping

[10:26] <jnthn> This is convenient

[12:10] <Kaiepi> when do you need to use MVMROOT? i have a feeling async sockets don't entirely use it properly after reading that slew of commits related to MVMROOT from a while ago, but i can't really say i know anything about how it's used besides how it takes MVMObject-based structs

[12:11] <timotimo> i can explain

[12:11] <timotimo> moarvm's GC relies on a set of roots to find every live object; one effect of not having an MVMROOT when it's needed is that an object can be freed erroneously while some C code is still working with it

[12:12] <timotimo> it also uses marking to find all references both to find more live objects, and to have the pointers that need updating

[12:12] <timotimo> so another effect of an MVMROOT being missing is that the pointer you're not rooting will point at the previous location where an object lived

[12:13] <timotimo> so you'll have to MVMROOT all pointers that you'll be using in the future, and they have to be rooted at the moment a GC run could happen, which is everywhere something gets allocated or when a GC_SYNC_POINT is explicitly put into the code

[12:23] <Kaiepi> perfect, so what i had written before i thought to ask about it was right

[12:25] <Kaiepi> i knew the pointers to gced could move after reading those commits, but not really the details as to why

[12:25] <Kaiepi> thanks

[15:00] <Guest15407> hmm, ==95035== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

[21:07] <brrt> \o

[21:08] <brrt> .tell pamplemousse I found something interesting (I think); it's possible to define the 'main' in a shared library

[21:08] <tellable6> brrt, I'll pass your message to pamplemousse

[21:10] <brrt> so it's possible to create a, say, libmoarstarter.so, which we'd link to the ELF-ppacked file, and which would know to load the CU from memory

[22:03] <jnthn> How, does that work in a cross-platform manner?
