[11:23] <timotimo> https://bitbucket.org/wolfpld/tracy - this tool has a C API in the current development version; having a tool that can display telemetry information like this one would be a gigantic step up from the current telemeh implementation

[22:22] <ugexe> for getlexref_* the legojit shows 1 operand used for 2 args such that if I use $2 in the exprjit it complains about an invalid reference. If I try to use $1 for both args in the exprjit it tell me "getlexref_i: lexical is not an int". What do I need to use on $1 to get at its .lex.idx and .lex.outters ?
