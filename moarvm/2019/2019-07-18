[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Put limits on local and inline counts for inlining

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: We have some non-linear algorithms as part of inlining - of note, in the

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: deopt tracking. If the frame gets too big in various ways, the cost of

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: that can become very large. Put some limits in place to catch such

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: cases, so we won't end up spending a vast amount of time trying to win

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: performance, but end up blocking the application for multiple seconds

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: due to the spesh thread getting stuck in a highly costly loop.

[13:08] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/cfb5b3ae0f

[13:12] <nine> jnthn: that must have been very interesting frames

[13:14] <jnthn> The routing regex generated by Cro::HTTP::Router for an application with quite a lot of routes :)

[13:14] <jnthn> "regex" - it contains a ton of code blocks too

[13:15] <jnthn> And they're mostly all small assertion checks, so it decided to try and inline them all, which would be fine, except for the non-linearities involved.

[13:16] <jnthn> The innermost part of the loop was ending up doing half a million executions per inline

[13:17] <jnthn> I suspect there's a better way to deal with this, but for now this avoids doing such costly work

[13:18] <lizmat> fwiw, I've seen it take 20+ seconds  :-)

[13:18] <jnthn> I guess what makes the deopt so active is that a regex has some very long-lived registers too (like the current position)

[13:18] <jnthn> So they end up living over a load of deopt points, also making the analysis very costly

[13:19] <jnthn> lizmat: I didn't time it, but I think it was heading that way for me too

[13:20] <lizmat> it took so long, most people assumed it was hanging permanently

[13:20] <nine> Wow....so this is the first time spesh's own performance became a real issue?

[13:21] <jnthn> Well, in such a dramatic sense, yes

[13:21] <jnthn> We did also have a case where we got a significant increase in spesh cost, also related to deopt tracking

[13:21] <jnthn> Though that wasn't causing anything like this, just a measurable slow-down in spectest time

[13:22] <jnthn> (And the algorithm in question got optimized quite a bit later.)

[13:31] <timotimo> huh, but spesh normally won't block the program?

[13:33] <jnthn> It needs to join GC

[13:36] <timotimo> ah, right

[13:41] <timotimo> it occurs to me that a system that sends notifications of things like "gc is happening" to an observing process wouldn't be able to send a "gc started" signal until the gc has finished

[13:42] <timotimo> and a situation where gc is taking very long wouldn't be identifiable as such

[13:45] <jnthn> Well it would be when we finally get around to it...it's not that the thing hangs forever

[13:45] <jnthn> So it'd belatedly show what happened

[13:46] <timotimo> if we ever have a bug that gets the spesh thread busy for like two to five minutes, an impatient dev may have already killed the process and be none the wiser

[13:47] <lizmat> impatient devs have done so after 5 secs already

[15:08] <timotimo> ooh, good catch

[15:08] <timotimo> that's probably the cause of these crashes i wasn't able to figure out a couple weeks ago

[15:10] <jnthn> Not the only profiler problem, alas...

[15:10] <jnthn> Running into various "profiler lost sequence"

[15:11] <timotimo> yes, those puzzle me rather a bit; maybe i can come up with a semi-graphical tool that lets me more easily explore what's going on there

[16:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[16:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: We could attempt to duplicately instrument code when multiple threads

[16:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: started to execute it around the same time, which could lead to crashes,

[16:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: since it was assumed that would only happen once. Do it under lock, so

[16:39] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ab7bac5ad1

[16:39] <timotimo> ooh, ouch

[16:39] <timotimo> i was somehow under the impression that racing to install an instrumentation was fine, i guess?!

[16:42] <jnthn> We still have issues with the sequencing, alas...and also debug, which seems to SEGV or die with random errors

[16:42] <jnthn> (On the large app I'm testing it with)

[16:44] *** zakharyas left
[16:49] *** lizmat left
[16:50] <timotimo> the debug instrumentation, right?

[16:50] <timotimo> using them at the same time is unfortunately not possible, though i've wondered if maybe there should be a way to get the debugserver without the breakpoint instrumentation

[16:51] <jnthn> Yes, the debug one

[16:51] <timotimo> i haven't had that one crash at all :o

[16:52] <jnthn> Also odd: I've currently got a deadlock under it

[16:53] <jnthn> Wherein we have a lot of spesh plugin call_resovler instances trying to uv_mutex_lock(&tc->instance->mutex_hllconfigs);

[16:53] <jnthn> And they're deadlocked on that

[16:53] <jnthn> And if I look in the lock structure to see who owns it...it's one of the threads waiting for it

[16:57] *** patrickb joined
[16:58] *** Kaiepi left
[16:59] *** robertle joined
[17:27] <jnthn> OK, this is very odd

[17:28] <jnthn> (Separate from the lock issue above)

[17:28] <jnthn> We have a case where the instrumented frame tries to execute an op that does not exist in the instrumented bytecode

[17:28] <timotimo> some reentrancy issue or are other locks involved somehow?

[17:28] <jnthn> the op is atpos2d_n, fwiw

[17:28] <jnthn> Which is op number 665

[17:28] <jnthn> Which appears *nowhere* in the disassembly

[17:29] <jnthn> But...

[17:29] <jnthn> 00058      breakpoint         368, 665

[17:29] <timotimo> could very well be the cur_op went sideways half an instruction

[17:29] <jnthn> Yes, seems to...but...how?

[17:29] <timotimo> that happened back when we still uninstrumented code after turning off the profiler

[17:29] <jnthn> This is debug, not profile

[17:29] <jnthn> Also, I didn't actually connect a debug client

[17:30] <timotimo> the instrumentalization is now properly locked, yeah?

[17:30] <timotimo> any deopt happening that could be screwing up?

[17:31] <timotimo> there's no possibility to inline a frame that hasn't been properly instrumented for example when a frame calls that frame only very rarely, and gets speshed before it does that one for the first time?

[17:31] <jnthn> I think that locking is done properly, yes

[17:31] <jnthn> There's no spesh cand on the frame

[17:32] <jnthn> Further, the static frame has no spesh candidates yet

[17:32] <jnthn> So I think deopt of this frame is impossible

[17:33] <jnthn> The frame itself *is* being invoked in parallel

[17:33] <jnthn> Oh...uh...

[17:33] <jnthn> Dammit, we were updating the instrumentation level *before* performing it

[17:33] <jnthn> So yeah, we could end up doing nasty things I guess

[17:34] <timotimo> ouch

[17:34] <timotimo> wew that's dangerous

[17:35] *** rfold joined
[17:35] <jnthn> Isn't it jsut

[17:37] *** lizmat joined
[17:38] <jnthn> Yeah, I've never managed to get this app this far under the debugger

[17:38] <jnthn> Nice

[17:38] <jnthn> Yeah, it's holding up pretty good so far

[17:38] <timotimo> amazing that it'd take us this long to find it, though instrumentation isn't that common for regular users

[17:45] <jnthn> Even better news: it fixes the broken profiling I had earlier too :D

[17:45] <timotimo> brilliant!

[17:46] <jnthn> I wonder if it fixes the fact that the debug server immediately falls in a heap on Windows even on simple programs...I fear not

[17:46] <timotimo> o_O

[17:46] <jnthn> OK, will test/spectest

[17:46] *** lizmat left
[17:46] <jnthn> If you have a moment to look into why it explodes on windows, that'd be nice :)

[17:47] <timotimo> i wonder if one of those 1h windows VMs from appveyor would be enough for that :)

[17:52] <jnthn> The profiler issue was a "lost sequence" one, by the way

[17:52] <jnthn> I think probably the race meant that we got code installed that did an exit, but missed the enter

[17:53] <timotimo> quite possible, though the breakpoint ops would also mean some ops get executed twice maybe. that's not quite as dangerous as skipping ops, though

[17:53] <jnthn> Well, op boundaries moving was very dangerous :)

[17:54] <timotimo> aye

[17:54] <jnthn> But anyway, this makes debug/profile a lot more useful for multi-threaded apps :)

[17:54] <jnthn> As in, "not liable to fall in a heap" :)

[19:45] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:46] <MasterDuke> timotimo: yes. i tried to get a spesh log, but there are multiple processes, so i get some `free(): corrupted unsorted chunks` and then an incomplete/corrupted spesh log

[19:47] <MasterDuke> jnthn: yeah, at HEAD as of right before i posted

[19:48] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i think i've patched moarvm before to add the pid to the filename, i can do that again

[19:48] *** lizmat left
[19:49] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I think if you do something like spesh_log.%s or some such it will subsititute the process iD there

[19:51] <MasterDuke> jnthn++ i'd forgotten about that

[19:54] <timotimo> aye, it wants a %d

[19:54] <MasterDuke> ok, now have 14 log files. but what am i looking for the longest of? the string 'merge_graph' doesn't show up in any

[19:54] <timotimo> right, you'll have to find the one with the longest total time

[19:54] <timotimo> i'd grep out all "time taken" first, and sort them

[19:54] <timotimo> then grep for the top results to find the files they come from

[19:55] <timotimo> and from there, find the last "After" before that, or maybe look below for the "latest guard tree" or whatever

[19:58] <MasterDuke> longest specialization was 168474us, there were 6 > 100000us

[19:59] <timotimo> i'm not so good with units, how many seconds is that?

[19:59] <timotimo> 1000 us == 1ms?

[19:59] <timotimo> 1000000 is one second?

[20:00] <timotimo> so the longest specialization time there was 0.17s?

[20:01] <MasterDuke> `Spesh of '' (cuid: 294, file: gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:5682)`

[20:01] <MasterDuke> 400 BBs

[20:02] <timotimo> that's a big one. i wonder how many of the inner blocks from the ifs and fors have been inlined at nqp's optimizer stage already

[20:03] <timotimo>                 elsif $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_int32 || $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_int16 ||

[20:03] <timotimo>                         $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_int8 || $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_uint64 ||

[20:03] <timotimo>                         $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_uint32 || $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_uint16 ||

[20:03] <timotimo>                         $ins_result_kind == $MVM_reg_uint8 {

[20:03] <MasterDuke> believe it's https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTCompilerMAST.nqp#L988

[20:03] <timotimo> you think this gives very big bytecode? big enough that we want an nqp::list_i instead? or something?

[20:04] <timotimo> yes, that's the line for me locally, too

[20:04] <MasterDuke> i have no idea. sounds like a jnthn question

[20:04] <timotimo> every || will turn into a conditional

[20:05] <timotimo> i.e. increase the number of BBs

[20:05] <MasterDuke> ah

[20:06] <MasterDuke> would it help to pull something like https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTCompilerMAST.nqp#L1165-L1198 out into it's own method/sub?

[20:08] <timotimo> good question; i'd say the vast majority of registers have obj, int64, num64, str, or perhaps even uint64

[20:08] <timotimo> so perhaps put only all the elsifs out there

[20:08] <timotimo> though i must repeat, i don't know how much bytecode this part translates into

[20:09] <timotimo> though i guess looking at the line numbers in the BBs could be interesting

[21:06] <jnthn> Could just make an array and index it with the register kind, I guess

[21:06] <jnthn> Or a bitmap if they're powers of 2

[21:07] <brrt> pamplemousse: how are things going?

[21:08] <brrt> anything I can do to make the process smoother? :-)

[21:09] <pamplemousse> Things are going well! I've been working on adding the --compile flag and simplifying things so that to make the exe, you just do perl6 --compile blah.pl6, and to run it, you just type ./blah

[21:10] <pamplemousse> I think I'm probably going to have that done by the end of the day, fingers crossed, which is exciting

[21:11] <brrt> pamplemousse++ that is exciting indeed

[21:13] <pamplemousse> I still have the module packaging to finish, so right now that --compile version would still be calling whatever modules are installed locally on the machine, but I've been doing some reading through things and I'm getting closer to tackling that part as well. I'll probably have a few more questions on the module side of things once I finish up the --compile flag

[21:14] *** zakharyas left
[21:15] <brrt> that's fine, best to do one thing at a time

[21:16] <brrt> how do you like rakudo hacking versus MoarVM hacking?

[21:22] <pamplemousse> Both have been pretty fun. Rakudo hacking is a little interesting since I'll frequently wind up needing to look in the NQP repo or the MoarVM repo for something that's being called to figure out what's going on, whereas MoarVM is a bit more self contained. Working with the Rakudo stuff has done wonders for my tenuous ability to read and write Perl 6, which is nice. I still find myself mostly dealing with calls to MoarVM and

[21:22] <pamplemousse> reading through things here, which I didn’t expect given where most of the actual changes are. I’m enjoying getting to see the bigger picture of how everything works together.

[21:22] *** lizmat joined
[21:24] <brrt> :-) it's a big system for sure

[21:25] <brrt> so the executable that you're going to build, it's going to be precompiled, correct?

[21:25] <brrt> (i.e. perl6 source to MoarVM bytecode)

[21:26] <brrt> I expect that's going to help a lot already

[21:29] <pamplemousse> Yep! It's MoarVM bytecode. It is being executed via perl6 at the moment, so I'm not avoiding the start up times there yet. But at the very least, it doesn't have to compile anything, which should help at least a bit

[21:33] <MasterDuke> pamplemousse++ i would expect that to help more than a bit

[21:34] <brrt> Cool :-)

[21:34] <brrt> Yeah, the perl6 compiler itself isn't very fast

[21:34] <brrt> But like you said, it won't take anything of the cost of 'perl6 -e '''

[21:35] <brrt> anything beyond that though, it is likely to help

[21:51] *** rfold left
[21:55] <timotimo> i would expect not having to even look for Grammar.nqp, Actions.nqp, and World.nqp could improve startup a fair bit

[21:55] <timotimo> further stuff like the QASTCompilerMAST, QASTOperationsMAST, the optimizers, ...

[21:55] <timotimo> it really adds up, doesn't it?

[21:56] <timotimo> jnthn: would you like to link 6guts into the perl6 webring "officially"? it'd not be much more than putting three or four links somewhere and including a javascript if free wordpress allows … probably not

[22:06] <brrt> is there an official perl6 webring?

[22:06] <brrt> are we bringing back webring?
