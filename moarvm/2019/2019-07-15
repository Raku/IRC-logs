[13:23] <timotimo> brrt, got anything to talk about regarding the devirtualization stuff?

[13:24] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[13:24] <brrt> not yet :-$

[13:24] <brrt> pamplemousse: what's your next step?

[13:25] <timotimo> no problem :)

[13:35] <pamplemousse> brrt: Next step is figuring out how to include multiple files and/or modules in the ELF, and making sure that the program uses the included modules

[13:37] <brrt> pamplemousse: cool

[13:38] <brrt> can I suggest, as an intermediary step, to have a 'packed' file format

[13:43] *** zakharyas left
[13:43] <pamplemousse> That wouldn't be a bad idea, since it's probably going to start getting pretty big.

[14:56] <brrt> pamplemousse: I wasn't really suggesting compression, though :-)

[14:56] <brrt> I meant to say, a single file that contained a number of serialized compunits

[14:57] <patrickb> Please excuse the heretic question: What is the advantage of an executable (ELF) Perl 6 script over a usual script?

[14:57] <brrt> we'll talk later when I'm back

[14:57] <brrt> patrickb: legion

[14:57] <brrt> One of the things on top of my mind is startup time

[14:58] <brrt> an executable, especially a statically linked one, is lazy-loaded by the system loader, ideally with a single syscall

[14:58] <brrt> currently perl6 has to walk a path to find CORE.setting, load it, etc.

[14:59] <brrt> that isn't cheap
