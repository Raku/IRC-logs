[11:12] <MasterDuke> i don't understand why i just can't remember/figure this out (i even tried looking in the irc logs!), but what do i have to do to create a PR updating our libtommath?

[15:33] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: I guess Timotimo knows

[15:34] <dogbert17> I have done it for libuv but I suspect it doesn't work quite the same with libtommath

[15:35] <dogbert17> btw, did nine return from NZ?

[15:36] <nine> I did

[15:36] <dogbert17> cool, was it a nice trip?

[15:38] <nine> Very much so!

[15:40] <dogbert17> and you obviously liked the Observatory visit

[15:42] <nine> How could I not? With the luck of my life when the sky against all predictions went from fully overcast to clear in the 2 hours I slept before going to the observatory :)

[15:42] <dogbert17> what a stroke of luck :)

[15:45] <dogbert17> nine: btw, do you know anything about how the MultiCache works in MoarVM?

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: 97615be0ad | (Stefan Seifert)++ | 3 files

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix JIT compiled native calls returning negative (char|short|int)

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: We need to properly expand return values to 64 bit for signed types. Otherwise

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: we'd end up with some positive number instead.

[15:47] <nine> nope

[15:47] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/97615be0ad

[15:47] <dogbert17> darn :(
