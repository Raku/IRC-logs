[00:10] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[00:10] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: even though the sp_bind_o looked correct to many eyes.

[00:10] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: we expect the problem is something that used to not go

[00:10] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: through the exprjit because sp_bind_o caused the exprjit

[00:10] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: to bail out earlier is now active

[00:19] <timotimo> damnit, the other stuff got merged into moar master directly after the bump

[00:19] <timotimo> so i'll have to also revert that and re-revert it back

[10:48] <timotimo> uh oh, looks like more than just sp_bind_o is wrong

[10:49] <timotimo> i wonder if i should revert all of them for now and put them into a branch

[10:49] * nwc10 suggests

[10:49] <nwc10> 1) step away from the keyboard

[10:49] <nwc10> 2) make coffee (or something)

[10:49] <nwc10> 3) ponder this

[10:49] <nwc10> and after a delay, see if you have the same answer in your head

[10:49] <timotimo> i've just been away from the keyboard for a whole bunch of hours :P

[10:50] <nwc10> aha. pre-delayed

[10:50] <nwc10> as to the actual question, I don't know

[10:50] <timotimo> i regularly stock up on away-from-keyboard time

[10:50] <nwc10> I'm not sure what I'm going to do for away-from-keyboard time once I've finished flattening the garden

[11:53] <nine> timotimo: moving them off into a branch would indeed be nice for others who work on the VM. Especially since they cause mysterious and hard to reproduce issues.

[12:39] <nine> Oh, I think I misdiagnosed the spesh plugin race condition issue. I thought that resolve_using_guards was using a plugin_state that was already freed by a concurrent add_resolution_to_guard_set. But this already uses MVM_fixed_size_free_at_safepoint.

[12:41] <nine> I bet what actually happens is that this old plugin_state is no longer anchored somewhere where the GC would find it, so the guards it contains can become outdated.

[12:42] <nine> Usually it would hang off the MVMStaticFrameSpesh but add_resolution_to_guard_set replaces it with the new version.

[12:44] <nine> The bad news is that this is not just a case of adding an MVMROOT and be done with it. The good news is that this is still in the realm of problems that I know how to solve :)

[12:49] <Guest15407> timotimo: your templates are probably good, the problem lies elsewhere

[12:49] <timotimo> yeah, but making them available causes trouble

[12:49] <Guest15407> true true :)

[16:46] <MasterDuke> timotimo: why did my PR merge have to be reverted? couldn't just the template commits have been reverted and then a new bump?

[16:47] <timotimo> then the bump would have had the merge in it, too

[16:47] <MasterDuke> also to everybody, my bad on asking for the bump in the first place

[16:47] <timotimo> but the merge was specifically delayed after the bump

[18:04] <nine> It occured to me that I totally wasted those GC fixes I did. I could have kept a pile of them, just pushing one per week and ensure my mention in the weekly for almost a year in advance! Then I could have become known in the community as the possibly corrupt memory guy...or....wait...nah, better not :D

[18:08] <MasterDuke> so many different options for hyphens to change meaning there: possibly-corrupt memory guy, possibly corrupt-memory guy, possibly corrupt memory-guy, possibly corrupt-memory-guy, possibly-corrupt-memory guy, possibly-corrupt memory-guy, possibly-corrupt-memory-guy
