[13:12] <ugexe> moar HEAD is broke on windows, so bumping the version doesn't seem logical

[13:28] <timotimo> it's a test case where an optimization gives wrong results, right?

[14:11] <pamplemousse> Hello!

[14:11] <yoleaux> 19 May 2019 12:25Z <brrt> pamplemousse: I think the invalid read is the most important thing; because of ASLR you won't always get a segfault

[14:12] <pamplemousse> Yep, that's what I tracking down now. Thanks!

[14:14] <brrt> :-)

[14:14] <brrt> Ok, great

[14:14] <brrt>  

[14:17] <brrt> have you succeeded at reproducing the bug btw

[14:28] <pamplemousse> I have

[14:29] <brrt> btw... do you have something of a blog, or a twitter account, or whatever, where you can publish your progress

[14:30] <brrt> Most everyone here does, and for me, it's quite a motivation to finish things, so that I can 'brag' about it on my blog :-)

[14:31] <timotimo> i'm just now writing a blog post, but it's turning kind of rambl-y

[14:31] <timotimo> :/

[14:31] <pamplemousse> I don't, but I can start one

[14:31] <brrt> Would be nice

[14:32] <brrt> timotimo: I've found that it's often better to just keep writing, and maybe edit it later into something readable, than to just give up

[14:32] <brrt> (which I've done many times)

[14:32] <timotimo> true

[14:32] <timotimo> you can't edit an empty page, after all

[14:34] <ugexe> patrickb: you have to run make test for it to fail

[14:34] <ugexe> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rakudo/rakudo/builds/24670106/job/xsl6e4ym3a0b8xwh#L4674

[14:35] <ugexe> one of the last 4 moarvm commits

[14:35] <patrickb> ugexe: OK. Then it's clear why I didn't notice that problem.

[18:42] <pamplemousse__> Still working on #1068. I think I've tracked down the issue to src/io/eventloop.c:299, where there's a comment saying "Not sure we can always do this". https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/eventloop.c#L298

[18:42] <pamplemousse__> It looks like the issue has something to do with how threading works between MoarVM and libuv but I'm not super familiar with how those work. Could anyone shed a bit of light on what's going on/give me a few pointers on what I might need to do to fix this?

[20:34] <brrt> pamplemousse: it's kind of late so I can't give any more notes, unfortunately. My suggestion is to get to a debugger

[20:34] <brrt> also. If you're not feeling like you're making progress, don't feel obligated to complete this

[20:35] <brrt> It may be that it is more complicated than I initially estimated... and I don't want to scare you off just yet :-)

[20:36] <brrt> ok, /me afk
