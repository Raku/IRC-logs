[06:48] <MasterDuke> can anyone else confirm that reverting https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1111 doesn't change profiles, i.e., they still have `<anon> gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1824` at the top?

[08:16] *** sena_kun joined
[09:39] <MasterDuke> timotimo: the time column in moarperf shows '<exclusive> / <inclusive>', but the buttons up top are inclusive then exclusive

[09:39] <MasterDuke> i think something should be switched

[12:31] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: are you looking onto the gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1825 problem?

[12:38] <MasterDuke> dogbert17: yeah. at first i assumed it was becuase of something i did(n't) do in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1111

[12:39] <MasterDuke> but i reverted that and nothing changed, so now at least i don't think i'm to blame (probably)

[12:39] <dogbert17> I think the problems start with  https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/1b76b3456881e6c29fab713c3c7f59ba8809fe1f

[12:40] <MasterDuke> huh. it goes away if you revert that?

[12:41] <dogbert17> the previous commit, i.e. b8db58753317c19a2220a3148cd168bc3a691585 looks good on my system, the one above is the first one where things starts to look wonky

[12:44] <dogbert17> with commit 1b76b3456881e6c29fab713c3c7f59ba8809fe1f the most expensive routine is said to have taken 36893488147417.62ms (profiling a program which takes ~1 sec in total)

[12:45] <MasterDuke> ugh, yeah, also trying to figure out why that still happens

[12:45] <MasterDuke> can you repro that reliably?

[12:45] <dogbert17> everything is good, as far as I can tell, on the previous commit b8db5875

[12:46] <MasterDuke> but with 1b76b3456881e6c29fab713c3c7f59ba8809fe1f the profiles always have the absurdly expensive routine?

[12:47] <dogbert17> yes

[12:47] <MasterDuke> what perl6 code are you using to test?

[12:47] <dogbert17> a super program :-) gimme a sec to gist it

[12:48] <dogbert17> https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/02202b34d4c4cbcdff9632c1a2ac387c

[12:51] <dogbert17> https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

[12:53] <MasterDuke> arg, doesn't do the absurdly expensive routine for me

[12:54] <dogbert17> that's odd

[12:55] <dogbert17> did you sort on exclusive time?

[12:56] <MasterDuke> yep

[12:58] <dogbert17> that's interesting, we must be doing something different

[13:00] <MasterDuke> well, the times it has happened for me, running the exact same command again results in a normal profile

[13:00] <MasterDuke> so it's something somewhat non-deterministic

[13:04] <dogbert17> interesting

[14:11] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: awake?

[14:12] <MasterDuke> yep

[14:13] <dogbert17> I have changed my mind slightly :-)

[14:13] <dogbert17> look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/69ed7816d2fd99ed6a41746267c2dd1cb10e7fba

[14:13] <MasterDuke> hm. something changes around that commit?

[14:13] <dogbert17> if I remove the two line change in  src/profiler/log.c  things work for me on head

[14:15] <dogbert17> at least with my example prg, perhaps I should test a few more

[14:17] <MasterDuke> huh. i don't really know why that's doing it. maybe timotimo has an idea?

[14:17] <dogbert17> he seems to have disappeared, perhaps his computer is busted

[14:18] <MasterDuke> does anything change if you use a confprog?

[14:20] <dogbert17> have never tried that. I don't know how to use them :(

[14:45] <MasterDuke> hm, tools/compile_confprog.p6 gives `===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/dan/Source/perl6/MoarVM/tools/compile_confprog.p6 Variable '$custom_reg_base' is not declared at /home/dan/Source/perl6/MoarVM/tools/compile_confprog.p6:692`

[14:48] <MasterDuke> dogbert17: if i add an fprintf in that `if` it prints 4 times when just doing a normal --profile

[14:49] <MasterDuke> which seems a little odd when the variable name it's checking is `was_entered_via_confprog`

[14:51] <dogbert17> true

[14:52] <MasterDuke> moving https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/log.c#L106 to be inside the block it's directly after made those prints go away, but the profile looks the same

[14:57] <MasterDuke> wait. the `<anon> gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1824` is still there, but now the percentage of the rest of the inclusive times are different

[14:57] <dogbert17> does it look better?

[14:58] <MasterDuke> at HEAD (plus my fprintf), `<anon> gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1824` is 100% inclusive, and `<unit-outer>` is at 50%

[14:58] *** patrickb joined
[14:59] <MasterDuke> if i move https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/log.c#L106 inside the block it's directly after, then `<anon> gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1824` is still 100% inclusive, but `<unit-outer>` is at 100% also (and the rest go slowly down from there)

[15:00] <dogbert17> and did you remove lines 116-117? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/log.c#L116

[15:00] <MasterDuke> nope, just added a print inside the if

[15:01] <dogbert17> ok, I removed them and things started to look a lot better on my end

[15:04] <patrickb> .tell jnthn I think the install location of perl6.moarvm did not change. It was and is installed to ${RAKUDO_PREFIX}/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm. Do you still hit a problem with this?

[15:04] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[15:04] <MasterDuke> i don't understand the confprog stuff well enough to know if that's the correct fix, but dogbert17++ for making progress

[16:55] <Kaiepi> can someone review https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1126 ? i don't expect it to be merged before the next release, just i have a feeling i may be using the wrong type for families and want to have it ready as soon as it gets released

[16:55] <Kaiepi> if you guys have time, i know people are busy with blockers atm
