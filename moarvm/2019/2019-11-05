[10:56] <Guest13443> m: say 'Is there anybode out there?'

[10:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: ¬´Is there anybode out there?‚ê§¬ª

[10:56] <Guest13443> superb spelling as usual :(

[10:56] <moritz> just us bots :D

[10:56] <Guest13443> :)

[10:57] <Guest13443> is nine or jnthn around by any chance ...?

[11:01] <jnthn> I'm not a bot?

[11:01] <Guest13443> unless you've had coffee you might be :)

[11:02] <Guest13443> I just wanted to post some observations wrt R#2261

[11:02] <synopsebot> R#2261 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2261 [ASYNC] Crashes in t/spec/S17-promise/lock-async-stress2.t

[11:03] <Guest13443> if I add some extra debug code to src/6model/reprs/MVMMultiCache.c it turns out that when the corruption is detected

[11:04] <Guest13443> it is always in 'Multi cache for cas'. Does that give you any ideas?

[11:04] <jnthn> Not really. I've spent hours on that one in the past without success. Though it *is* suspicious that it only happens wiht cas.

[11:05] <Guest13443> I also have a printout of the cache in question if that is of any help

[11:06] <Guest13443> Does it look ok? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b74f1c978a7cf6df2562be3668979b26

[11:08] *** tobs joined
[11:08] <Guest13443> I inserted the debu codeg here, including a call to dump_cache: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/MVMMultiCache.c#L259

[11:10] <jnthn> Pretty sure those nulls in there aren't a good thing

[11:11] <jnthn> oh, wait though

[11:11] <jnthn> The initial ones are likely OK

[11:11] <jnthn> Since I think it uses the first 8ish entries as a hash

[11:13] <Guest13443> If you can think of anything else I could do to debug this, please let me know

[16:11] <Guest13443> this multicache thingy seems to be a bit over my head

[16:21] <Guest13443> jnthn: can I trick you into taking a peek at the updated gist ... https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b74f1c978a7cf6df2562be3668979b26

[20:19] <dogbert17> hi nwc10

[20:29] <MasterDuke> vrurg: nine is probably your best bet to ask that question to

[20:32] <vrurg> MasterDuke: thanks, I could've guessed it.

[20:32] <vrurg> .seen nine

[20:32] <tellable6> vrurg, I saw nine 2019-11-01T08:18:45Z in #raku-dev: <nine> AlexDaniel: yes, since I only use the basename 2 lines down. It needs to accept / as $file will be something like "resources/libraries/p5helper.so"
