[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Even if there's no clearly winning guard index, we can at least replace

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: speshresolve by sp_speshresolve and get rid of the logging and enable JIT

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: compilation for that frame.

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: The comments suggest that it has always been intended this way and that the

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: return was just an oversight happening due to the 2 halfs of the function

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: being written a month apart.

[08:06] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/34fac5f4ef

[09:47] <nine> A new data point: disabling the JIT hurts Inline::Perl5's master branch a lot (~33 %) while it hurts my optimized branch just a little (~13 %).

[09:49] <nine> And another one: according to perf enabling the profiler reduces time spent in MVM_interp_run by ~ 90 %. And that time consists mostly of entering JITed code.
