[16:15] <tellable6> brrt, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[16:16] <timotimo> we have a stupid debug printer for P6opaque

[16:16] <tellable6> 2019-08-18T16:15:41Z #moarvm <brrt> timotimo: do we have a stupid debug printer for MVMObject?

[16:16] <timotimo> but not for MVMObject in general

[16:16] <brrt> hmmm

[16:16] <timotimo> oh, do you mean a prettyprinter for gdb?

[16:16] <timotimo> a plugin?

[16:16] <brrt> nah, just something I can do instead of fprintf

[16:17] <timotimo> oh, like inside your own code

[16:17] <brrt> yeah

[16:17] <timotimo> there's surely something that could be done based on the code that the debugserver uses to tell the debug client what an object is

[16:26] <brrt> hmmm

[16:26] <brrt> I can use the debug_name

[16:27] <brrt> also, is there a way to make a typed array in nqp?

[16:27] <brrt> an array with slot_type = MVM_ARRAY_I64

[16:27] <timotimo> sure, the nqp test suite has some of those

[16:28] <timotimo> also any code that tries to encode/decode string data

[16:35] <brrt> yay

[16:35] <brrt> I found it

[16:35] <brrt> nqp::list_i() does the trick :-)

[16:35] <timotimo> oh! of course!

[16:35] <brrt> ok, I'm afk for a bit

[16:35] <brrt> I stole your devirt code from graph.c timotimo :-)

[16:36] <timotimo> i have been robbed!

[16:36] <brrt> and am now integrating it into the epxr jit

[16:36] <brrt> .oO( Intellectual property is intellectual theft? )

[16:36] <timotimo> i'm glad that exprjit gets a bit of the devirt love :)

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Only getlexperinvtype → constant if only one type record exists

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: It only appeared in profiling, and only rarely, but somehow

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: a getlexperinvtype had gotten multiple wrong types, the first

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: of which turns out to be NQPMu, which is definitely wrong.

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This gets rid of that crash, but the underlying question why

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: those types were recorded in the first place isn't solved.

[16:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: running while the main thread was doing the data gathering

[17:05] <timotimo> okay, just a few days old

[17:06] <dogbert17> vrurg might be interested, I remember him mentioning a SEGV when trying to heap profile something

[17:11] <MasterDuke> timotimo: does that fix profiling of the mqtt tests?

[17:11] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[17:14] <timotimo> it fixes one bug that only sometimes happened

[17:14] <tellable6> 2019-08-18T17:11:59Z #moarvm <MasterDuke> timotimo: does that fix profiling of the mqtt tests?

[17:15] <timotimo> how did the mqtt tests usually fail?

[17:16] <MasterDuke> SEGV after the tests finished, but before it wrote out the profile, `MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 60 in GC work pass` during the tests, or that NQPMu thing which i think you just fixed

[17:18] <MasterDuke> it's always one of those, i've never seen a profile actually completed

[17:19] <MasterDuke> oh, i did just get a segv during the tests

[17:51] <dogbert17> timotimo: could the profiling problem with mqtt also be spesh related, i.e. that the profiling have pointer to spesh related stuff which are no longer valid?

[17:51] <tellable6> dogbert17, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[17:51] <timotimo> doesn't sound too likely, i don't think

[17:51] <tellable6> 2019-08-18T17:51:02Z #moarvm <dogbert17> timotimo: could the profiling problem with mqtt also be spesh related, i.e. that the profiling have pointer to spesh related stuff which are no longer valid?

[17:52] <dogbert17> there tends to be an 'MVM_spesh_deopt_one' in the backtrace

[17:52] <timotimo> with jit turned off?

[17:53] <dogbert17> yes

[17:56] <dogbert17> it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/8ad7bc49636bba48f66e0b43ad399bc5

[17:57] <timotimo> OK, that's in the middle of running i believe?

[17:57] <timotimo> like, that test file has like 500 tests

[17:58] <dogbert17> yes, the nursery has been made smaller and MVM_GC_DEBUG=1
