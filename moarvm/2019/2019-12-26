[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix segfaults after callbacks originating in JIT compiled calls to native code

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Before running a non-toplevel frame, we need to make sure, the caller's frame

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: has a valid return_address. While MVM_nativecall_invoke_jit and

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: MVM_nativecall_invoke did so, the JIT implementation of calls to JIT compiled

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: native functions did not. This could lead to segfaults when native code called

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: from JIT compiled code ran callbacks which then tried to return to the NULL

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: address.

[11:59] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix by initializing tc->cur_frame->return_address in the callback_handler, so

[13:14] <tellable6> 2019-12-21T14:12:40Z #raku-dev <patrickb> tadzik Thanks for the reply and heads up!

[13:14] <tellable6> 2019-12-21T14:12:53Z #raku-dev <patrickb> tadzik I'll go forward in that direction then.

[19:50] <tadzik> sena_kun: in case you missed it: pretty much all of my stuff is abandoned :)

[19:50] <sena_kun> so I checked, well, everything from our ecosystem. I think, a moarvm release can be shipped from https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7ab23a1b89d4a191fc0f9547ba2a0b6866ce3d95 (as I checked this one)

[19:51] <sena_kun> tadzik: yeah, needed to make sure. :)

[19:52] <sena_kun> I am not sure about including https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ae66545c7b0a95bc68fbbcea29727c076d38c7a2 and don't think I'll test another 400 modules from our ecosystem by hands, at least not this release. :S

[19:52] <sena_kun> but if it looks sane to core devs and passes tests, I think it is pretty much safe anyway

[19:53] <sena_kun> (does it count as a green light?)

[19:54] <lizmat> sena_kun: if nine is ok with it, I'm ok with it  :-)

[19:55] * sena_kun hopes we'll be able to do the release this month

[20:09] * lizmat too  :-)
