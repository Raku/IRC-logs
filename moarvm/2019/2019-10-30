[16:22] <nwc10> Oh my, we have Rakudo in production at $ork. Running the time tracking system. So nothing big. But something we can get in legal doo-doo for if it miscounts.

[16:27] <jnthn> That's...quite important :)

[16:28] <jnthn> I mean, not quite as important as running the coffee machine, but still...

[16:28] <nwc10> :-)

[16:28] <nwc10> yes, but that seems to have enough software to go wrong, despite the fact that (as best I can work out) all it has is a microcontroller to get the thermostat to talk to the heating element

[16:29] <jnthn> Ah, rather simpler the one in the office here

[16:30] <nwc10> that

[16:30] <nwc10> that's the manual thing

[16:30] <nwc10> the fully automatic thing likely has a far more funky thing

[16:30] <nwc10> given the buttons

[16:30] <nwc10> and the display

[16:30] <jnthn> Yes, that sounds closer to what I've got :)

[16:30] <nwc10> and the nagging "are you really sure that you emptied the internal bin just now?" confirmation message

[16:30] <jnthn> It gets through a lot of coffee beans, but the coffee is tasty

[16:31] <jnthn> This one is usually nagging for more water :)

[16:31] <nwc10> the big one is plumbed into water

[16:31] <jnthn> It takes on trust that when it told you to empty the grinds bin that you really did; it just counts those

[16:31] <nwc10> but the drip tray is not plumbed in

[16:31] <nwc10> you can see a failure mode here...

[16:31] <jnthn> But it seems to have something smarter on the drip tray

[16:31] <jnthn> haha...ouch

[16:31] <nwc10> yep

[16:32] <nwc10> and the drip tray is entirely dump, with a little floaty thing to signal that the "wetware" needs to deal with the wet before the carpet also becomes wet
