[14:24] <lizmat> and another Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/2019-25-on-toolsets/

[14:37] <timotimo> we're at about 32degc, too

[14:41] <MasterDuke> 24 here, which is a welcome change from what it is back home

[14:42] <dogbert17> 24 is reasonable, 32 not so much :)

[14:42] <timotimo> just gotta be thankful it's not 42

[14:44] <pamplemousse> 32 sounds awful... We're at 26 here, which is a nice change of pace

[15:04] <pamplemousse> .tell lizmat I noticed in the perl6 weekly news that my most recent blog post wasn't under the GSoC section this week. Is there something I should do (maybe using notable6: weekly?) so it makes it in next time?

[15:04] <yoleaux> pamplemousse: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[15:34] <antoniog1miz> Hi! I have this parallel code => https://gist.github.com/antoniogamiz/c09b16ee979d991a61c2bdcbf6f1eb4d

[15:34] <antoniog1miz> but Pod::Load use a decoder which throws this exception => https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/1049e09a99791ac00a11f481a7f2e0d51d8a7d05/src/6model/reprs/Decoder.c#L114

[15:34] <antoniog1miz> any idea about how to fix it? :/

[16:06] <lizmat> .tell pamplemousse added your blog to this P6W, sorry for having missed that

[16:06] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to pamplemousse.

[16:07] <lizmat> .tell pamplemousse alternately, you could add your post to either Hacker News or /r/perl6 on Reddit

[20:18] <timotimo> yo dogbert17, you need me, or something?

[20:22] <dogbert17> timotimo: did you see/read my ramblings from yesterday wrt the profiler?

[20:25] <dogbert17> MasterDuke also rambled :)

[21:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Kaiepi++ created pull request #1128: Add missing concreteness checks to most array ops

[21:33] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1128

[21:42] <timotimo> i might have missed them

[21:42] <timotimo> it's just two screens of page-up back, isn't it?

[21:44] <timotimo> the "fix profiler entering frames via confprog" commit was under suspicion?

[21:45] <dogbert17> timotimo: yes

[21:45] <timotimo> oh, interesting

[21:45] <timotimo> yeah, that doesn't seem to be in the right spot, setting it to 1, that is

[21:45] <timotimo> seems to want one line upwards

[21:45] <dogbert17> I belive that MasterDuke thought so too

[21:45] <timotimo> but changing that didn't make a difference in the profiler result?

[21:46] <timotimo> oh btw the confprog compiler is now a module on cpan

[21:46] <dogbert17> I was more brutal and removed the change in log.c from commit https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/69ed7816d2fd99ed6a41746267c2dd1cb10e7fba

[21:47] <dogbert17> that seems to fix things for me

[21:47] <timotimo> interesting

[21:47] <timotimo> yeah, if no confprog is present, none of these changes should be active

[21:47] <timotimo> so that's a good hint

[21:47] <dogbert17> yeah

[21:48] <timotimo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/configuration.c#L5 - btw :) :)

[21:48] <dogbert17> I could try moving line 106 'was_entered_via_confprog = 1;' upward

[21:48] <timotimo> putting some documentation in a comment isn't worth much if the rest of the code you write makes people think it's no use looking for explanatory comments ...

[21:49] <timotimo> please do

[21:49] <timotimo> i'll be rebuilding lots of perl6 stuff on my desktop

[21:49] <dogbert17> lemme try

[21:50] <timotimo> more comments as well as a confprog.md in the docs/ folder would surely be a good idea

[21:52] <dogbert17> it seems to work, my example program now has 'SETTING::src/core/operators.pm6:432' as the most expensive routine instead of 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1825'

[21:53] <dogbert17> that is promising :)

[21:56] <dogbert17> timotimo: perhaps you should blog about the confprog compiler

[21:57] <timotimo> https://wakelift.de/2019/05/22/close-look-at-controlling-moarvm-profiler/ - you mean like this?

[21:58] *** sena_kun left
[21:59] <dogbert17> haha, timotimo++

[22:00] <timotimo> i don't advertise my posts enough :)

[22:01] <dogbert17> I'm sure lizmat knows when you have written a post though

[22:22] <timotimo> that post is old already :D

[22:23] <timotimo> like a month almost exactly

[22:50] <MasterDuke> timotimo: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/tools/compile_confprog.p6 dies during a `perl6 -c` with `===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/dan/Source/perl6/MoarVM/tools/compile_confprog.p6Variable '$custom_reg_base' is not declaredat /home/dan/Source/perl6/MoarVM/tools/compile_confprog.p6:692`

[22:51] * MasterDuke is off to sleep now

[22:54] <timotimo> MasterDuke: the fix is to "git rm tools/compile_confprog.p6"

[22:55] <timotimo> i'll do that
