[12:05] * brrt wonders who, here, has airconditioning

[12:05] <timotimo> i recently bought a rather cheap small airco unit

[12:05] <timotimo> i'm an enviro-sinner in that way :|

[12:05] <brrt> portable?

[12:05] <timotimo> aye

[12:05] <brrt> hehe

[12:06] <timotimo> can't drill a hole through the wall

[12:06] <timotimo> don't really have a sensible spot for an outside-unit

[12:06] <brrt> can't, or aren't allowed to?

[12:06] <timotimo> i expect the outer wall to be *very* resistant to drilling

[12:06] <brrt> there are drills out there that are *very* resistant to walls

[12:06] <brrt> :-)

[12:06] <jnthn> No air-con here, alas.

[12:06] <timotimo> the only spot that's even remotely sensible to put a hole through is literally directly behind a radiator, too

[12:07] <brrt> jnthn: I think you said that you had very thick walls, htough

[12:07] <jnthn> Office is still an OK temperature without it.

[12:07] <jnthn> brrt: Yes, the walls are fine, the problem is facing the sun and having huge windows :)

[12:07] <timotimo> no aircon in your office either?

[12:07] <jnthn> If we had an apartment oriented the other way I bet we'd not complain

[12:08] <brrt> nope, no aircon here

[12:08] <nwc10> the cellar at home holds steady at roughly 19C

[12:08] <nwc10> without aircon

[12:08] <nwc10> and has good daylight (By design)

[12:08] <timotimo> were our apartment mirrored, we'd have less of a problem with the heat, though if i understand correctly what that physics phd friend told me, we'd also immediately annihilate with the atoms around our apartment, so might not worry about heat as much any more

[12:09] <jnthn> timotimo: No, which is fine most of the time (today it's hot outside, but sensible in the office)

[12:09] <timotimo> OK

[12:09] <jnthn> Though if there's a long run of hot days, it starts to get less comfortable. Pondering getting a portable for such situations.

[12:09] <jnthn> Though not quite sure where to eject the air

[12:10] <brrt> these days, in NL at least, you can get a heat pump, which is the same thing, and be super environmentally friendly

[12:13] <pamplemousse> I have air conditioning, the heat in the summer here can get pretty awful without it.

[12:13] <timotimo> my parents have a heat pump in their house, at least i think that's what it's called

[12:13] <timotimo> but it doesn't get rid of heat, i don't think

[12:15] <Guest12727> it's supposedly quite hot in large parts of Europe today

[12:16] <jnthn> 29 here, which is hot, but not totally horrible

[12:17] <Guest12727> it must be bordeline horrible :)

[12:22] * timotimo gets to find out what happens when an exception is thrown inside of a confprog

[12:23] <jnthn> Guest12727: It'd certainly hotter than I'd prefer.

[12:23] <jnthn> But it's when it gets into the 30s that things get really nasty (hard to cool apartment, so can't sleep well, etc.)

[12:24] <timotimo> it has knock-on effects :(

[12:27] <timotimo> oh, there's literally a null filename in this compunit

[12:38] *** Altai-man_ joined
[12:38] <timotimo> hmm. moar bytecode to get from -1 vs >= 0 to 0 or 1 ...

[12:38] <timotimo> adding 1 gives me 0 for -1 and nonzero for the rest, but i want 0 and 1 specifically

[12:38] <timotimo> not it twice, lol

[12:40] <ugexe> my place has 2 central aircons, but its already 90 degrees every day :P

[12:41] *** sena_kun left
[12:41] <brrt> None of us know what kind of weird units you're using ugexe :-P

[12:41] <brrt> in seriousness, 90 degrees F is, like, 30 degrees Celsius?

[12:41] <ugexe> the kind connected to house HVAC, not window unit

[12:41] <ugexe> or *those* units, not aircon units

[12:41] <timotimo> gotta love C

[12:41] <ugexe> s/or/oh/

[12:44] <brrt> much better than F, or C++

[12:44] <ugexe> C++ has better atomics

[12:44] <brrt> In fairness, I've been learning about C++ and ehm.

[12:45] <brrt> The thing that I find weird is that people talk about them as if they are the same

[12:45] <timotimo> "them"? like C vs C++?

[12:45] <brrt> like 'C/C++'

[12:45] <timotimo> ha

[12:46] <brrt> aside from a bit of syntax, the use of header files and the fact that both are typically compiled to machine code, the use of 'idiomatic' C++ looks *nothing* like ididomatic C

[12:46] <brrt> pamplemousse: predefined macros in GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html#Standard-Predefined-Macros

[12:47] <brrt> in Visual C++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html#Standard-Predefined-Macros

[12:47] <brrt> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/predefined-macros?view=vs-2019 I mean

[12:48] <brrt> oh, hang on

[12:48] <brrt> check out 'src/gen/config.h' - '#define MVM_BIGENDIAN'

[12:49] <brrt> this is generated from 'build/config.h.in', which in turn is generated by Configure.pl, which eh, is somewhat complex, but works

[12:51] <pamplemousse> Neat, thanks!

[12:59] <brrt> :-)

[13:00] <brrt> there was a page somewhere that had a big last of all predefined macros in common compilers

[13:00] <brrt> I don't actually think anybody worries about compilers other than GCC and MSVC++

[13:00] <brrt> even with clang, since clang tries really fairly hard to be compatible with GCC

[13:10] <pamplemousse> Good to know

[13:15] <timotimo> geth is down?

[13:16] <brrt> not for the first time

[13:17] <timotimo> string ops: starts-with, ends-with, contains, index

[13:19] <timotimo> and the .cu field of an sf, so that you can get at its filename (or its hll_name if you want to)

[13:20] <jnthn> Neat

[13:21] <timotimo> the example that's currently in the confprog_compiler is "does the filename contain 'CORE'?"

[13:41] <timotimo> the sf.cu.filename is not quite as interesting, though; for the core setting it's always the absolute path to CORE.setting.moarvm, for example

[13:41] <timotimo> what we really want is the frame's first annotation's filename, i'd claim

[17:19] <japhb> I'm not sure if we have it worse or better over here -- 40c is even a common temp in some areas (especially further from the coast), but it's also common to have A/C basically everywhere indoors.

[17:40] <brrt> it's uncommon here and in appartment buildings it's actually quite difficult to get permission to install them

[17:47] <japhb> Why, out of curiosity?  Power usage?  Fear of leaking coolant?

[17:47] <japhb> Noise?

[17:47] <ugexe> ugly as hell

[17:48] <japhb> Oh, so you mean, the window- or wall-mount form, rather than central systems

[17:49] <ugexe> im not sure an appartment would let you install a central system

[17:50] <japhb> Erm -- I mean, why don't landlords install central systems?

[17:51] <ugexe> if the tenants pay electric then it would have to be cost of unit or cost of HVAC upgrades. if electric is included in rent then it would probably be they dont want to pay for running a/c nonstop

[17:52] <japhb> hmmm

[17:55] <ugexe> this is for U.S. though where business dont give a shit about leaking coolant or noise

[17:56] <ugexe> in northern U.S. the only apartments i recall not having central a/c were really old and would probably require hvac upgrades

[17:58] <brrt> japhb: the apartments are privately owned, in this case; landlords very much don't install HVAC in NL, it being seen as a ridiculous luxury

[17:58] <brrt> and. People think they're ugly

[22:28] <jnthn> Part of the issue is that every summer that I've been here in Prague (this is the 4th one) has been "above average" in terms of temperature, while if we'd had the average then it'd have been pretty borderline about AC being needed.

[22:30] <jnthn> Assuming those averages are historically correct, I can understand why AC is not common here: you'd maybe only really be able to justify turning it on for maybe a month worth of days in the year, and when it's that rate to need it, it's tolerable without.

[22:30] <jnthn> *that rare

[22:33] <timotimo> i hear there'll be more "above average" temperature days than on average in the future

[22:33] <jnthn> Indeed.

[22:34] <jnthn> Also, there are, I believe, some rules about installing AC in the center, I think about retaining the aesthetic.

[22:34] <timotimo> it has to look cool?

[22:35] <jnthn> I guess it has to look historic, to keep the tourists coming :)

[22:35] <jnthn> Given how touristed the very center is these days, I'd not want to live there anyway.

[22:36] <jnthn> You only have to be 20 minutes walk away from that to have relative peace and quiet :)

[22:36] <jnthn> (As much as I'd expect to have living close to the center of a capital.)
