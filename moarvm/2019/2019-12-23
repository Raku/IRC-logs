[09:37] <nine> Looks like even with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/fc41473c03659205bdd4dc8d7022ac27ef6f81ec there's still some issue with finalizers and nested runloops.

[09:38] <nine> I'll try to find a proper fix in the evening.

[09:39] <nine> Please if you want to do a release before I got that fix, commit this workaround: https://gist.github.com/niner/b2988f1824f58473195caad9f26163f0

[09:40] <nine> This restores the old behaviour which is also broken, but in a more benign way (missed DESTROY calls and potential memory leaks instead of segfaults)

[15:08] <nine> Aaah...now I get it :) Funny how obvious such issues are once you find out what's going on.

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix even more obscure crashes when returning from a native callback

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: The special_return or special_unwind handler may schedule a finalizer call for

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: the current runloop. If we are already in the top most call frame of the

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: runloop, we need to replace the thread_entry_frame with the finalizer call.

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Otherwise we won't run the special code for ending the runloop when the

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: finalizer returns.

[15:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3806735a4b

[15:49] <nine> lizmat: this ^^^

[16:07] <nine> But of course, there's yet another regression :( Reproducible with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 perl6-gdb-m -Ilib t/data_in_module.t

[16:07] <nine> Apparently caused (or uncovered) by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/357adb45bf831fe4e9fbe32d40b2d76542636fa5 which I pushed by accident

[16:08] <nine> (hence the rather short commit message)

[16:29] <nine> Ok, looks like this is not that bad. It's purely a side effect MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1. With that, we never even run a non-optimized version of the code but start right away with the JIT compiled one. The JITed code however does not contain the check if the native library is loaded.

[16:29] <nine> After all the non-JITed code would have long done this and we want to be fast.

[16:30] <nine> So even changing the spesh threshold from 1 to 2 when MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 gets rid of the issue. So I conclude that this will never appear under normal circumstances and I can relax :)

[16:33] <nine> The part I don't understand is why this doesn't break any other test files with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1.

[16:37] <nine> Anyway, seems like we've regained stability and got rid of a couple bugs. A release with this would be very welcome :)
