[21:21] <dogbert17> nine: "char is signed on Intel and unsigned on ARM (the Pi)" according to answer on https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=233557

[21:21] <lizmat> YUK

[21:21] <dogbert17> could that be the reason assuming that the information in the link is correct?

[21:23] <nine> WHAT?

[21:24] <dogbert17> shocking ?

[21:24] <lizmat> to me that is a WAT

[21:25] <lizmat> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054939/is-char-signed-or-unsigned-by-default

[21:26] <lizmat> "The standard does not specify if plain char is signed or unsigned"

[21:27] <MasterDuke> then maybe we should add `-fsigned-char` to the compiler options for rpi

[21:27] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: perhaps for other systems as well: "This causes problems on ARM based machines since "char" is of the "unsigned" variety, which allows the compiler to generate faster, more efficient code. ARM is not alone in this - SGI Mips running IRIX also encounters this problem."

[21:28] <dogbert17> Dunno if those systems are still in use

[21:28] <dogbert17> the Irix stuf that is

[21:29] <lizmat> so why do we assume chars are signed?  wouldn't it be better to thing of them as unsigned ?

[21:30] <nine> I think the best course of action is to revert my changes to that file and just disable the warning. It's quite ironic that it's the same warning that now pointed out correctly that the code is wrong. Previously it read if (0 <= gb2312[i] && gb2312[i] <= 127) which covers both the signed and unsigned cases but will do one superfluous check in any case

[21:30] <dogbert17> nine: it was two files

[21:32] <japhb> lizmat: Not looking at that particular code, so this could be unrelated, but don't we use negative values for signed char/short/int in strings to indicate that we've created an artificial combined grapheme "codepoint" to allow fast string indexing by grapheme?

[21:32] <dogbert17> gb2312.c and gb18030.c

[21:32] <lizmat> yeah, but those are 32-bit ints

[21:32] <lizmat> I believe?

[21:33] <japhb> lizmat: I thought we did an 8-bit form as well for efficiency with european codepages?

[21:33] <japhb> To whit, making latin-1 fast

[21:33] <lizmat> ah, in that case, it's above my pay level

[21:33] <japhb> It's a vague memory for me as well.

[21:34] <nine> negative graphemes are synthetics, but that's distinct from our 8-bit encoding handling

[21:35] <nine> Will push a fix tomorrow
