[02:09] <timotimo> you can now get from the types/frames listings (top lists or rather everything-lists) to a search for all objects of the given type (or in the case of frames, filename or frame name) and from there you can get to the collectable explorer

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Give higher layers a way to check if a nativecall site is set up.

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: nqp::unbox_i on a NativeCall object will now report whether the library was

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: loaded or not and if we successfully JIT compiled a function body for it.

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: This avoids the need for redudant state keeping of different layers.

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Implement serialization of NativeCall reprs with dyncall

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: When a NativeCall using module is loaded both by the current computation unit

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: and one of its dependencies, native subs may become repossessed. Repossession

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: will clear the MVMNativeCallBody structure as this is supposed to be

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: repopulated on deserialization. This did not happen causing segfaults when

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: the generated function body tried to invoke the JIT compiled calling code.

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: Fixed this by implementing serialization/deserialization of NativeCalls. On

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: deserialization we will use the stored lib_name and sym_name to load the native

[11:48] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: library and also try to JIT compile the function body.
