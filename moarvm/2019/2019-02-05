[00:00] <jnthn> Hm, dunno why not

[00:00] <jnthn> Weird

[00:01] <jnthn> Going to rest; will maybe have something more useful to suggest after sleep :)

[00:03] <MasterDuke> thanks for the help, later...

[00:19] <MasterDuke> .tell jnthn backtrace here https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/bb0971db705d5b9dae9e7a7635fb3372, that's the only time that line gets hit

[00:19] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[00:30] <timotimo> you made sure to deactivate the jit, right?

[00:37] <MasterDuke> no. but i realized the name gets changed later. i just adjusted the conditional to `nqp::getppid() if nqp::existskey(nqp::getenvhash(),'NQP_OPT_DEB') && nqp::eqat(self.name($obj), 'Perl6::Grammar', 0);`

[00:38] <MasterDuke> and now i'm getting a couple hits

[00:38] <timotimo> ah, that makes sense

[01:32] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[01:43] <MasterDuke> timotimo: do you see anything of interest in those backtraces? nothing is particularly speaking to me...

[01:56] <timotimo> no, not really :\

[03:08] <MasterDuke> huh, i just tried adding an `int` type constraint to :$value here https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/QAST/IVal.nqp#L4 (while on my default-to-int branch) and the nqp build hangs at one of the final steps

[03:08] <MasterDuke> `./nqp-m --target=mbc --output=NQPP5QRegex.moarvm \     gen/moar/stage2/NQPP5QRegex.nqp`

[03:08] <MasterDuke> with 100% cpu

[03:10] <MasterDuke> perf top shows the top function at 56% is VMArray_gc_mark

[03:15] <MasterDuke> false alarm. accidentally deleted a `$` somewhere. put it back and everything is fine

[03:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any idea where <at(1)> would be implemented in NQP?

[06:47] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[14:26] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I was so uninspired I didn't even have any dreams... :)

[17:29] <timotimo> MasterDuke: btw did you measure an improvement from jitting the dir ops?

[17:30] <MasterDuke> not really. i don

[17:30] <MasterDuke> 't think they were especially hot, but i figured it's better for the jit not to bail at all

[17:55] <MasterDuke> timotimo: up for some tricky troubleshooting?

[17:58] <timotimo> probably not :|

[17:59] <MasterDuke> good call

[18:00] <timotimo> i already had a headache when a blackout gave us the perfect opportunity to finally install the light fixtures in the living/pc room

[18:01] <timotimo> working above your head can be really rough; holding a rather heavy drill when you have to be scared your RSI is going to come back soon ...

[18:01] <nwc10> I hope your ceiling is easier than ours

[18:02] <nwc10> as in, succumbs to the drill in less than 15 minutes

[18:02] <timotimo> oh yeah

[18:02] <timotimo> it's not heavy for no reason

[18:02] <timotimo> it's one of those that'll go back and forth if you turn that feature on

[18:03] <nwc10> I think ours thinks that it's the roof of a WWII U-boat pen.

[18:03] <nwc10> (note, I am not inviting destructive testing to confirm this hypothesis)

[18:04] <nwc10> (in particular, we are a *long* way from the sea. And whlist the "Neusiedlersee" might *seem* be a a "

[18:04] <timotimo> ha, yeah

[18:04] <nwc10> ea", its max depth is less than my height, so you'd have trouble hiding *anything* in it)

[18:08] <timotimo> hide lots of usb thumbdrives

[18:15] <nwc10> do they work if they've been for a swim?

[18:18] <timotimo> some do
