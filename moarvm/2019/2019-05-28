[13:26] <jnthn> pamplemousse: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/bytecode.markdown should be fairly complete

[13:27] <pamplemousse> Thank you!

[13:33] <brrt> iirc, nine should also know the odds and ends, having written the new bytecode compielr

[13:38] <pamplemousse> Alright

[15:42] <pamplemousse> timotimo: If you're on, I had a quick question about your output using the command you mentioned using to get the bytecode: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/moarvm?date=2019-05-24#l95

[15:43] <pamplemousse> Your output (https://gist.github.com/timo/6d0f3787da94a09b01a5fe58b1aec1ee) is much prettier than mine (https://gist.github.com/pamplemoussecache/d9340bfa38ae7abffa79cf1987397bf5) and while mine looks pretty much like what I expected, I was wondering if there's an extra step I could have taken to get output that looks like yours

[15:54] <timotimo> pamplemousse: you should get the output i got from "moar --dump bloop.moar"

[15:56] *** brrt joined
[15:57] <pamplemousse> timotimo: That worked, thanks!

[15:58] <timotimo> great

[16:04] <timotimo> y'know, if you'd like you could look into making "moar --dump" just a little smarter with regards to the files rakudo puts in precomp folders; those files start with a bit of ascii (or utf8 more likely) that has some hashes and a stringified "dependency specification"

[16:04] <timotimo> after the first hash there's a 0a byte, which i think is \n, and after the second one there's a 0 byte

[16:05] <timotimo> then there's a filename starting with a repository name, like perl#sources/blahblah, followed by another null byte

[16:05] <timotimo> then another hash, another null byte

[16:05] <timotimo> and then there's the ascii/utf8 DependencySpecification.new(blahblah) followed by two 0a

[16:05] <timotimo> and *then* comes the "MOARVM" magic cookie that moar --dump looks for

[16:06] <timotimo> very low importance, just a little convenience feature

[16:06] <timotimo> AFKBBL

[16:52] <timotimo> pamplemousse: btw, here's a tool nine wrote to pick a moarvm file apart into its individual pieces, maybe you'll find it useful: https://gist.github.com/niner/c24f4c2f8ae04ad448652e03669d6423

[16:53] <pamplemousse> Neat, thanks!
