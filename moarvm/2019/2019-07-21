[09:57] <AlexDaniel> samcv: Nice!

[09:59] <samcv> AlexDaniel, would it be better to just release moarvm as is, or should it only have the commits in that link?

[10:03] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I'd prefer only the commits in the ticket to be included (i.e. a new branch from 446b27b602 and with mentioned commits `git cherry-pick`-ed)

[10:27] <samcv> ok. cool

[14:10] <pamplemousse> o/

[14:13] <brrt> I finally figured out how I want to do 'named' templates

[14:14] <brrt> (currently we have templates by opcodes, but I want it to be possible to declare a template 'foo' and to be able to construct a tree with 'foo' as a name)

[14:15] <brrt> e.g. for things like the exprjit 'invoke' sequence

[14:15] <brrt> I'm going to call them '(define: foo ($a:reg $b:num) ....)'
