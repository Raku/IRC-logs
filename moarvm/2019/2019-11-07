[00:04] <MasterDuke> jnthn: well, the `c ?? $b.split($a, |c) !! $b.split($a)` version is the only one that passes `make m-test m-spectest` and gives a better profile+spesh log

[00:14] <jnthn> Well, improvement then.

[19:45] <dogbert17> hi brrt

[19:49] <brrt> hi dogbert17

[19:50] <dogbert17> do you have time for another 'possibly missing break' question?

[19:51] <dogbert17> around here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/jit/tile.c#L377

[19:54] <brrt> yep, that's a missing break alright

[19:55] <brrt> it's fairly harmless

[19:55] <dogbert17> aha

[19:55] <brrt> but it's not right
