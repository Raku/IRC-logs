[00:47] <MasterDuke> samcv: what is the code you're running under heaptrack?

[00:53] <MasterDuke> anyone: any reason not to merge the two PRs of mine? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1059 and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1038

[00:57] <timotimo> not from me

[00:57] * timotimo runs away for like a whole day

[20:01] <andrzejku> hello

[20:03] <brrt> hi andrzejku

[20:04] <andrzejku> those mast files

[20:04] <andrzejku> why they are not a part of nqp?

[20:07] <brrt> I don't really know the answer to that

[20:07] <timotimo> because they are created from moarvm sources :)

[20:07] <brrt> well, that's a good reason :-)

[20:08] <andrzejku> timotimo, you mean C files into NQP?

[20:08] <andrzejku> and then NQP to MOARVM

[20:10] <timotimo> not exactly

[20:11] <timotimo> the source is src/core/oplist (and also there's a few nqp functions in it that are included from somewhere)

[20:11] <timotimo> and that generates a header file for moarvm's own use and the nqp and p6 files

[20:18] <andrzejku> what about files /usr/lib64/perl6/perl6/precomp/

[20:18] <timotimo> so, i have a describe_refs for ConcBlockingQueue that's supposed to give every object in there an index

[20:18] <andrzejku> precomp

[20:18] <timotimo> but my attempts to put that in gave me very strange results

[20:18] <timotimo> even though i modelled it closely after gc_mark

[20:18] <andrzejku> are they necessary for perl6 runtime?

[20:19] <timotimo> i mean ... rm them and try it out? %)

[20:19] <timotimo> or strace some common tasks to see if they are accessed

[20:34] <andrzejku> timotimo, : ( help

[21:49] <timotimo> did you delete the precomp files?

[23:11] <timotimo> ouchies!

[23:13] <timotimo> there's some confusion as to what the "count"/"size" parameter for read_buf should be interpreted as; bytes or bis

[23:13] <timotimo> bits

[23:16] <MasterDuke> !!

[23:16] <MasterDuke> who/what is confused?

[23:17] <timotimo> jit vs interp

[23:17] <MasterDuke> i can imagine that causing problems

[23:17] <timotimo> i don't understand a part of it

[23:18] <timotimo> it's about endian switching apparently

[23:20] <timotimo> OK, so flags & 1 would give true only for ENDIAN_LITTLE

[23:20] <timotimo> so that's basically "do we need to endian switch"

[23:21] <timotimo> no, i don't get this at all i don't think

[23:31] <timotimo> what the fuuuuuuuck
