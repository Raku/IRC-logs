[08:16] <nine> Of course, callbacks can be nested, quite deep even

[08:20] <nine> With that fixed, there's now only a lot of breakage with JIT enabled

[08:52] <nine> The good news is that its likely that the bug that caused me to go on the hunt seems to be the same that I'm currently working on fixing.

[08:53] <nine> I got started by one of Inline::Perl5's tests failing on an i586 build, so I tried to reproduce it in my normal dev environment. With MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING and MVM_SPESH_NODELAY a different test failed, which is what I've been debugging so far.

[08:54] <nine> I was quite worried that after all this work, I'd still have to investigate the actual bug. But chances are good that they are one and the same after all :)
