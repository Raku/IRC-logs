[06:36] <brrt> I should probably get breakfast one of these days

[06:43] <nwc10> I've just realised that logically breakfast is the only meal that should get mentioned here, given that it's always morning

[06:44] <nwc10> then again, if that were true, everyone would starve, because it would never be lunchtime

[06:44] <nwc10> (or everyone would get fat, because they'd always be having mid-morning snacks to tide themselves over until lunch)

[06:44] <brrt> Or we're just silent about it

[06:44] <brrt> Mid-morning snacks forever

[06:44] <brrt> not such a bad idea

[12:41] <dogbert17> jnthn, ugexe: wrt yesterdays discussion I added M#1104

[12:41] <synopsebot> M#1104 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1104 Spectest failures on 32 bit after commit 2fe2f588

[13:06] <brrt> I'm wondering if the cycle-breaking thing in the function call register selection, will work when we have multiple cycles

[13:07] <ugexe> I wonder if the comment on that commit, "This does rely on mp_digit being at least 32-bit, but we rely on that

[13:07] <ugexe> elsewhere in multiple other places already." means we need to audit

[13:09] *** zakharyas left
[13:10] <jnthn> ugexe: That's my feeling, yes, because I'm quite sure I saw another bit of bigint code using mp_digit with a similar assumption
