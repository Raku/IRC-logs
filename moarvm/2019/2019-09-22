[18:51] <timotimo> ohai brrt

[18:57] <brrt> ohai timotiom

[18:57] <brrt> timotimo

[18:58] <brrt> remind me, tomorrow maybe, to try again with debugging sp_bind_o

[18:58] <timotimo> oof

[19:00] <brrt> or not :-)

[19:00] <brrt> but I keep forgetting

[19:00] <timotimo> maybe i don't consider it important enough to bother you :)

[19:00] <timotimo> after all, there could be devirt, too ;)

[19:27] <brrt> hehehe, yeah

[19:27] <brrt> I forgot how far I got with that tbh

[19:31] <brrt> but I disagree.... the sp_bind_o bug, is a bug that probably lurks in the JIT

[19:31] <timotimo> it's true

[19:34] <MasterDuke> who knows what bugs lurk in the JIT? brrt knows!

[19:34] *** patrickb joined
[19:34] <brrt> If I knew, they wouldn't be lurking

[19:35] <brrt> and I wouldn't be worrying, just telling people to stay away :-P
