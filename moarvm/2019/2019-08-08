[22:51] <Kaiepi> i have a fix prepared for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3115, but i don't understand how the gc works well enough to explain why it fixes the segfault in the commit message

[22:53] <timotimo> wow, really?

[22:54] <Kaiepi> i just took previous_static_frames and put it in an MVMROOT2 alongside current_static_frames

[22:55] <Kaiepi> fsr that makes it so it passes make spectest again

[22:58] <timotimo> it's important to null the pointer out before putting it in an MVMROOT
