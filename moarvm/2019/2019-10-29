[13:30] <tellable6> 2019-10-28T20:48:41Z #raku <Kaiepi> brrt that'd be great

[13:31] <jnthn> o/

[13:32] <brrt`> ohai jnthn

[13:32] <brrt`> (I need to head out in like 5 minutes)

[13:32] <brrt`> jnthn: are you currently still working on the PEA work?

[13:33] <brrt`> for some liberal values of 'currently'

[13:33] <brrt`>  in the same way that I'm 'currently' working on expr jit devirtualization

[13:33] <jnthn> Not very actively, though it'll be one of the first things I do once I'm back to hacking on MoarVM more actively :)

[13:33] <jnthn> I've got a branch wiht a bunch of stuff done.

[13:34] <brrt`> I stumbled across a paper on partial escape analysis recently

[13:34] <jnthn> Link? :)

[13:36] *** donaldh joined
[13:37] <brrt`> hmm

[13:37] <brrt`> pdf, but idk where I got it from

[13:37] <brrt`> was from 2014

[13:37] <brrt`> and I might've gotten it from scihub

[13:38] * jnthn looked at various papers on the topic

[13:39] <brrt`> http://www.ssw.jku.at/Research/Papers/Stadler14/Stadler2014-CGO-PEA.pdf

[13:39] <brrt`> then there's a decent chance you've seen it

[13:39] <brrt`> anyway, have to go, speak you later

[13:44] <jnthn> Actually read the thesis that this paper is an extract of :)

[13:44] <jnthn> It's a good one

[20:07] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: Use more appropriate flags with getaddrinfo

[20:07] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:07] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: This makes it so getaddrinfo doesn't try to use the port passed to

[20:07] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: MVM_io_resolve_host_name like a service name, and only returns IPv4

[20:07] <Geth_> ¦ MoarVM: or IPv6 addresses if any exist on the interface used.
