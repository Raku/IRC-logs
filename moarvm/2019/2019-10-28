[13:56] <dogbert17> nice blogpost timotimo

[13:56] <timotimo> thank you!

[13:57] <dogbert17> the stroopwafel had me confused for a bit :-)

[13:57] <dogbert17> never heard about it before

[13:59] <timotimo> that may have been a little eurocentric

[13:59] <timotimo> i should perhaps put a link or two for people unfamiliar with it

[14:02] <dogbert17> not on my behalf, japhb have already posted an answer :)

[14:02] <timotimo> hm?

[16:59] <nwc10> which is because travis is ignoring some of its configuration? Or because the configuration we give it is not "tight" enough?

[17:38] <timotimo> that ususally happens when a bump was made at an unfortunate moment, i believe?

[17:39] <timotimo> like, when you bump the moar requirement of nqp while travis still has a queue of moar builds to process

[17:44] <timotimo> a bit of trickery could allow us to look for bump commits in nqp when doing the moarvm CI build and go back as far as necessary
