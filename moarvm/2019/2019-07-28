[00:00] <timotimo> d'oh

[00:00] <AlexDaniel> actually I'm not sure where this comes from, could be moarvm

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> if so then it's probably fine, as moar didn't get the fixes yet

[00:03] <MasterDuke> ugh, `mp_radix_size` for 2**100000 takes 0.5s by itself

[00:03] <timotimo> if you're .comb-ing a huge number, it could be interesting to make the barett calculation a little "lazy" so that it gets ten thousand digits, then combs over them, then gets another ten thousand, etc

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> oh, actually it's probably coming from 3rdparty/dyncallâ€¦

[00:05] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: this reminds me of the recent discussion to make .split lazy

[00:06] <timotimo> i don't remember that

[00:08] <MasterDuke> anyway, i gotta get to bed

[00:09] <MasterDuke> but i'll try and clean up the code in the next couple days and hopefully get it in good enough shape to make a PR for moarvm

[00:09] <AlexDaniel> TL;DR .split will split the whole string even if you want just [0]

[00:10] <MasterDuke> but i may not have a whole ton of free time, so if someone wants to go ahead and do it themselves, please feel free

[00:13] <timotimo> i've also got to go to bed

[00:13] <timotimo> hopefully this night will have some sleep in it

[12:15] <timotimo> chloekek: $nqpconfig is supposed to have what nqp --show-config has at the end where the lines start with nqp::, does that have a prefix key on your end?

[12:16] <timotimo> oh, that discussion was in the other channel

[12:17] <timotimo> it seems like actually nqp-config isn't available in that file
