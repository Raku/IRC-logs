[19:57] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: Fix JIT compiled native calls returning unsigned char|short with high bit set

[19:57] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM:

[19:57] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: For some unknown reason byte or word sized unsigned values can get sign

[19:57] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM: extended into rax, so we need to mask those high bits before pushing the

[19:58] <nine> I find it kinda surprising that this issue hasn't cropped up before.

[20:27] <japhb> If the unsigned char/short was only treated as opaque data, not as something to do math/logic with, then it may be sign extended on read and masked/truncated on write, and no one would notice.

[20:39] <dogbert17> nine: still around?

[20:40] <nine> yes

[20:40] <dogbert17> I believe that you can close M#763

[20:45] <dogbert17> nice
