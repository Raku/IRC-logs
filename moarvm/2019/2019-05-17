[09:49] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: `mp_clear` and `free` it at the end. We can get rid of this cost by

[09:49] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: holding a few `mp_int` objects on the `ThreadContext` and re-using them

[10:38] <brrt> :-o

[10:39] <jnthn> And that's before further improvements in the EA to devirt some more bigint operations :)

[10:40] <brrt> apparently, memmem segv's if it's argument is null

[10:41] <brrt> ... I think if the argument to MVM_VECTOR_CONTAINS is NULL, and MVM_VECTOR_SIZE is 0, then we should not crash

[10:41] <timotimo> yeah

[10:42] <brrt> which is what happens now

[10:48] <brrt> - problem nr. 1: I used MVM_VECTOR_ELEM_SIZE for the haystack size, rather than MVM_VECTOR_SIZE

[10:49] <jnthn> oops :)

[10:52] <brrt> - problem nr. 2: memmem will treat the needle as a pointer to the data it'll compare, whereas the current implementation was looking for the needle-as-value (with ==)

[10:53] <brrt> so I need to pass &t rather than t

[10:57] <timotimo> hm. are you sure that memmem is the right thing for MVM_VECTOR_CONTAINS though? since it'll advance by 1 byte during search, if i'm not mistaken?

[10:57] <brrt> jnthn: https://gist.github.com/bdw/993188860117efd91fd951f454ffaa1d

[10:58] <brrt> timotimo: is that so.... well... what's the alternative?

[10:58] <brrt> I thought memmem was optimized and stuff

[10:58] <timotimo> it is optimized!

[10:58] <brrt> but idk how :-D

[10:58] <timotimo> we do have memmem32, which is a memmem that goes by 4 bytes instead of 1 bytes

[10:59] <brrt> hmm

[10:59] <brrt> I'll leave that for you to discuss

[10:59] <timotimo> the thing is

[10:59] * brrt is listening

[11:00] <timotimo> the optimization of memmem relies on the needle being able to mismatch at a given position in an "interesting" way

[11:00] <timotimo> i.e. if you have a needle "bbbbbbbb" and a haystack of "aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb" you can look at the 8th byte, see that it's a, and know that the match can't be at position 8 or earlier at all

[11:01] <timotimo> but - unless i'm misunderstanding what VECTOR_CONTAINS is supposed to do - you're supposed to get back the index of an element

[11:01] <brrt>  ok.... well.. is there a default, library optimized, version of 'find this exact match at these offsets'

[11:01] <timotimo> those don't overlap AFAIK?

[11:01] *** zakharyas left
[11:01] <brrt> no, MVM_VECTOR_SEARCH is supposed to return a pointer

[11:02] <timotimo> right, a pointer to an element

[11:02] <brrt> ok, my understanding is wrong, then

[11:02] <brrt> because I need to search only the boundaries

[11:02] <timotimo> and since VECTOR_SEARCH is passing MVM_VECTOR_ELEM_SIZE, it can't be used to search for two consecutive elements either

[11:02] <brrt> I think that's normal, though

[11:03] <brrt> but what I don't want, is a half-item

[11:03] <brrt> so memmem is, indeed, not what I want

[11:03] <timotimo> that's just a peculiarity of the API we have

[11:03] <timotimo> i mean the API you're offering

[11:03] <timotimo> maximum shrug ;)

[11:03] <brrt> :-)

[11:03] <timotimo> i don't think you can get much faster than what the compiler turns MVM_VECTOR_CONTAINS into. that said

[11:04] <timotimo> the previous version of MVM_VECTOR_CONTAINS uses ==, does that work properly with structs in all cases?

[11:04] <timotimo> does it compile to something memcmp-like?

[11:04] <timotimo> i sometimes get confused as to what you're allowed to do with structs when it comes to assignment and comparison

[11:08] *** brrt left
[11:10] <jnthn> lunch; bbl

[11:54] * jnthn back

[11:59] <timotimo> can't wait to see where that "another 15%" could be from

[12:00] <Kaiepi> the stuff that gets discussed here always seems like arcane wizardry

[12:00] <timotimo> you can tell by the fact that i'm a part of it that this is all completely learnable

[12:00] <Kaiepi> lol

[12:01] <Kaiepi> i haven't really looked into moarvm much outside of bsd compatibility

[12:03] <jnthn> timotimo: It was from the "use a cheaper way to force_bigint"

[12:03] <timotimo> oh, i see

[12:03] <timotimo> yeah, the commit message even mentions the 15% figure again

[12:05] <jnthn> grmbl, I was going to make us devirt/avoid boxing with gcd_I, but turns out I've discovered a case where we're too conservative in BB merging...

[12:05] <jnthn> And so refuse to do things that would be safe enough

[12:16] <timotimo> aaw

[12:17] <timotimo> but that also means when that is fixed, other optimizations might be able to step in in other, similar situations?

[12:17] <timotimo> along with exprjit boundaries being disappered

[12:17] <jnthn> Yeah

[12:17] <jnthn> Hmmmm.

[12:17] <jnthn> Implemented what I thought would be a solution and it does something awful.

[13:16] <timotimo> you're working directly with eax, ecx, edx?

[13:17] <jnthn> Yeah. 'cus cdq and div work on specific registers

[13:17] <timotimo> ah

[13:17] <jnthn> TMP3 and TMP4 are r8 and r9, so no conflicts there

[13:17] <timotimo> of course they do

[13:18] <timotimo> right, TMP1 and TMP2 are rcx and rdx

[13:18] <jnthn> Yeah, ain't using those :)

[13:18] <timotimo> OK, that's fine at least

[13:18] <timotimo> i assume the code above the last hunk is also fine, since calling MVM_bigint_fallback_mul probably already worked fine?

[13:19] <timotimo> i wonder if | jo >1 is fine without braces around it

[13:19] <timotimo> good

[13:21] <timotimo> does turning off the exprjit make a difference btw?

[13:21] <jnthn> No

[13:23] <timotimo> OK

[13:30] <timotimo> just to make sure there are no gremlins; make clean everywhere? rakudo does have some extops, but i don't think they access MVMThreadContext fields directly

[13:34] <brrt> jnthn: will look

[13:34] <jnthn> I've been putting jmp >1 at various places (that is, esape to the fallback)

[13:35] <brrt> why `xor eax, edx`

[13:36] <brrt> and, it may be the case that the '4:' label is reused somewhere?

[13:37] <jnthn> brrt: Technique taken from https://helloacm.com/optimized-abs-function-in-assembly/

[13:37] <jnthn> Do labels have to be numbers, or can they be names?

[13:37] <jnthn> But yeah, I've been putting in a jmp >1 in various places (e.g. escape to the slow path)

[13:37] <brrt> global labels can be names

[13:38] <brrt> what I typically do is put an 'int 3' and step through

[13:38] <brrt> but that works in lldb, not in gdb

[13:38] <jnthn> And if I put it before the jnz >4 all is well

[13:38] <jnthn> If put it after the jnz >4 (e.g. when we should have fallen out of the loop) I get the error

[13:38] <jnthn> How do the label numbers actually work?

[13:38] <brrt> luajitish.

[13:39] <brrt> but to be more precise, there's a 10-item array of offsets that are computed in one of the three dynasm phases

[13:39] <brrt> and updated

[13:39] <jnthn> If I use the label 5 instead of 4 I get a SEGV

[13:40] <brrt> Yes, I think I made label 5 special

[13:40] <jnthn> 6 also segvs

[13:40] <timotimo> 4 non-special labels should be enough for anybody

[13:40] <jnthn> 7 too :P

[13:40] <jnthn> Well, 4 is busted also ;)

[13:40] <timotimo> d'oh :)

[13:41] <brrt> hmm

[13:41] <jnthn> Just differently

[13:41] <brrt> :-D

[13:41] <jnthn> But yeah, it seems to be something about the labels

[13:41] <brrt> actually, I think label 4 should be safe to use

[13:41] <brrt> oh, hang on

[13:41] <brrt> this is a loop backwards, isn't it

[13:41] <jnthn> I don't have to do anything special 'cus it's a back branch, do I?

[13:41] <jnthn> Yes

[13:42] <brrt> yes, you do

[13:42] <brrt> no, I think label 4 should be

[13:42] <brrt> https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/instructions.html

[13:42] <brrt> under 'Jump Targets'

[13:43] <brrt> a backwards jump is spelled 'jmp <4'

[17:45] <timotimo> very nice

[17:48] <jnthn> Next week I'll take a look at inserting materializations at merge points that require them, and also at fixing up the representation we produce to get rid of the broken SSA issues

[17:49] <jnthn> And probably put in div_I and mod_I devirt/EA too, though if anyone wants to steal that part (or indeed any of the remaning operators) then go ahead. :)

[17:49] <jnthn> Note that the branch isn't in a very good state in terms of stuff working :)

[17:49] <jnthn> I'm getting towards the point where I've done the features I want in it, and then the focus will switch to fixing it up and preparing for merge.

[17:50] <jnthn> There's at least one problem with deopt left.
