[02:38] <japhb> timotimo: The good thing is that PNG images of terminals aren't terribly large, so if I don't put very many in, it won't be too big.  Still, I wonder about the relative value of having screenshots inside or outside the repo (and if the latter, where to put them).  Another question is whether I want to combine several screenshots into one big animation.

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> japhb: I usually just drag and drop required images into a comment field, it uploads them to somewhere on github

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> japhb: then I just copy that link into markdown files

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> absolutely zero guarantees that this will last, but in practice it does

[15:43] <timotimo> clever

[15:43] <timotimo> i sometimes upload screenshots and little screencasts/gifs to discord and use their CDN for this same purpose :)

[20:29] <MasterDuke> timotimo: have you seen https://github.com/perl6/nqp/issues/560 ? i can repro locally. if i add an fprintf in MVM_bigint_is_prime it's printing the given value for b (the number of rounds)

[20:29] <MasterDuke> a bug in libtommath?

[20:30] <japhb> Ooh, AlexDaniel, that's a great idea.  Especially if the comment field is in an issue on the very repo I'm wanting an image in ...

[20:30] <timotimo> huh, it's claiming that 3 isn't prime if you do only 256 rounds?

[20:30] <MasterDuke> no. if you do more than 256 rounds

[20:31] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say nqp::isprime_I(3, 256); say nqp::isprime_I(3, 257);

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4ceb97e0: OUTPUT: «1␤0␤»

[20:31] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say nqp::isprime_I(3, 256); say nqp::isprime_I(3, 257257);

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4ceb97e0: OUTPUT: «1␤0␤»

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> japhb: yeah, if you actually post that comment then I'm pretty sure it'll last forever

[20:31] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say nqp::isprime_I(3, 256); say nqp::isprime_I(3, 257257257);

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4ceb97e0: OUTPUT: «1␤0␤»

[20:33] <japhb> m: use nqp; for ^300; { .say unless nqp::isprime(3, $_) }

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4ceb97e0: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> use nqp; for ^300⏏; { .say unless nqp::isprime(3, $_) }␤    expecting any of:␤        block or pointy block␤»

[20:34] <japhb> So it's not just that we chose a few random bad values, it's consistently wrong past that point.

[20:35] <timotimo> maybe the MVM_BIGINT_IS_BIG check is derped

[20:36] <MasterDuke>   /* valid value of t? */  if (t <= 0 || t > PRIME_SIZE) {    return MP_VAL;  }

[20:36] <MasterDuke> tommath.h:455:   #define PRIME_SIZE      31tommath.h:457:   #define PRIME_SIZE      256

[20:36] <timotimo> we don't check the return value of mp_prime_is_prime

[20:37] <timotimo> we should potentially throw if what it returns is not MP_OKAY

[20:37] <MasterDuke> yep

[20:37] <timotimo> can you check the return value it gives for those cases?

[20:37] <timotimo> ok, who wants to answer the ticket?

[20:39] <timotimo> and who wants to insert the return value check and exception throw?

[20:41] <MasterDuke> i can probably get around to it later, but don't let me hold anyone else back

[20:42] <timotimo> OK, i'll write a brief response on the ticket
