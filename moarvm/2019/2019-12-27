[13:31] <tellable6> 2019-12-17T15:36:39Z #moarvm <nine_> brrt: well, I did find it out in the end :) https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/moarvm?date=2019-12-14#l32

[13:34] <brrt> nine++

[13:34] <brrt> wonderful

[13:35] <brrt> I was eh... distracted :-S

[13:36] <brrt> yeah, that's exactly the mechanism

[13:36] <brrt> we overwrite the pointer used in the `ret` instruction

[13:41] *** domidumont left
[13:41] *** domidumont1 joined
[13:47] <nine> brrt: that mechanism is quite clever if I may say so!

[13:48] <nine> Just a little hard to grok from just reading the code :D

[13:50] *** sena_kun left
[13:51] *** sena_kun joined
[14:09] <brrt> yeah, I understand that

[14:10] <brrt> I actually wrote a blog post, but that may also be easier to understand with background information than without

[14:11] <brrt> http://brrt-to-the-future.blogspot.com/2018/06/controlled-stack-hacking-for-moarvm-jit.html

[14:13] *** sena_kun left
[14:13] <brrt> yeah, that doesn't quite do enough to figure out what the code is doing

[14:14] <nine> And blog posts in general do not show up when acking the repo

[14:17] <brrt> nope

[14:18] <brrt> anyway, we multiplied the bus factor on that code by 2 now :-)

[14:45] <nwc10> o/

[14:48] <brrt> ohai nwc10

[14:49] <nwc10> hi. I think that this is the first time I've looked at IRC for about 4 days.

[14:49] <nwc10> might well be AFK for anohter 2 or 3

[14:49] <nwc10> or possibly not, as tomorrow looks a bit too cold to attack the garden

[14:51] <brrt> you're a free... internet person..... you can do as you please

[14:51] <brrt> connect or disconnect
