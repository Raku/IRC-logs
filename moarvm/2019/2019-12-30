[11:27] <nine> So, running the multi threaded EVAL test script from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2272#issuecomment-569568214 gives an easily reproducible segfault. Unless one compiles with debugging enabled of course. Then it runs literally thousands of times without any hickup :/

[16:58] <vrurg> nine: actually, I forgot to mention that I also change EVAL to clone compiler instance. The current implementation simply shares one instance among threads.

[17:31] <nine> vrurg: does the compiler carry any state?

[17:54] <vrurg> nine: Sure it does. HLL::Compiler has 12 attributes, Perl6 adds 4 more.

[17:56] <lizmat> but once instantiated, do any of the attributes ever change ?

[18:01] <vrurg> lizmat: $!save_ctx perhaps, but not sure. In either case, cloning makes sense for my plans as I want to make EVAL support compunit compilation with separate language version.

[18:01] <lizmat> oki  :-)
