[00:28] <timotimo> i have "a" fix for putting native ints that are unsigned or non-64 into an MVMContext via bind_key

[00:28] <timotimo> should spectest of course

[00:48] <timotimo> ^- it works for SDL2::Raw at least :)

[00:50] <MasterDuke> timotimo: could i just add MVM_OP_sp_bind_i32 as another case here? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/jit/x64/emit.dasc#L759-L781

[00:51] <MasterDuke> or would it have to be dword instead of qword?

[00:54] <timotimo> yeah, dword is probably the right one

[01:03] <MasterDuke> k, thanks

[01:06] <timotimo> mrbl mrbl mrbl, the SDL_LockTexture thing doesn't work ... any more? again not?

[01:19] <timotimo> wasn't CArray[CArray[uint8]] supposed to work? >_<

[20:23] * timotimo is briefly confused by how exactly CArray and CStruct are set up for inlined cases, or just in general

[20:52] <samcv> i have been contacted by a prospective student for my two encoding related projects

[20:52] <samcv> a student in China with C and perl 6 experience wants to take on the task

[21:16] <timotimo> is that the person who came over to the #perl6 channel earlier?
