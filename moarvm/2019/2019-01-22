[08:19] <brrt> \o #moarvm

[08:19] <brrt> a different register allocation algorithm is starting to sound attractive

[08:20] <nwc10> o/

[08:20] <nwc10> based on bogosort? Or it's not that bad, *yet*? :-)

[08:25] <brrt> not that bad yet

[08:25] <brrt> want the gory details?

[08:26] <brrt> or the short summary? :-P

[08:26] <nwc10> it's all, um, I'm all teddy-bear to it

[08:26] <nwc10> so, I think that the short summary is more useful

[08:27] <brrt> the short summary is, linear scan, as a greedy algorithm, is great at just handing out registers fast. But it is considerably less great when there are constraints on what registers to hand out

[08:27] <brrt> now maybe there is a way out of there that I don't know yet

[08:27] <brrt> a hint bitmap that we collect... hmmm

[08:28] <brrt> but the thing is, x86-64 ISA is full of constraints like those

[08:28] <brrt> maybe what I really want is linear scan for something more regular (ARM perhaps), and something more complex for x86-64

[08:30] <nwc10> but right now you're working on x64-64, and "ARM JIT" is just an optimistic sentance? Hence solving the problem for x86-64 matters?

[08:30] <brrt> correct

[08:30] *** robertle_ joined
[08:30] <nwc10> and so by the time x86-64 is solved, it might still be just as easy to keep using the same approach for ARM (or arm64, which might be the only thing that matters by then)

[08:31] <nwc10> er, I forget, they call it aarch64?

[08:31] <brrt> yeah, it's weird
