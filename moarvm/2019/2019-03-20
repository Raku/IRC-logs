[01:26] <ugexe> unix,win: add uv_gettimeofday() #2221 https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/2221

[01:27] <ugexe> seems like that aught to be useful for something

[09:50] <lizmat> jnthn: seems like Range.clamp could be a useful addition: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55250700/is-there-a-clamp-method-sub-for-ranges-num-etc-in-perl6

[11:13] *** domidumont left
[12:10] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: perhaps start an issue on https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: IIRC it's not just clamp, there are several mathy things missing

[12:11] <AlexDaniel> so it would be great to have a bunch of them added in v6.e in a coherent way

[12:11] <lizmat> seems like you have a better idea as to what needs to be added  :-)

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> not from the top of my head

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> but we should start a list

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> I can file an issue thoughâ€¦

[12:13] <lizmat> ++AlexDaniel    :-)

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> I have to run now, but that's a start: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/4

[14:47] <brrt> ohai #moarvm

[14:49] <brrt> mgoebel: I think you reached out to me on email, correct?

[14:53] <mgoebel> brrt: Yes! I'm the student that reached out with interest about the GSoC project.

[14:56] <brrt> cool

[14:57] <brrt> so, are there any questions you have so far, anything I can clarify?

[14:57] <brrt> have you gotten so far as to get rakudo perl6 working on your machine?

[15:00] <mgoebel> Yes, I downloaded and installed it a couple months ago, but don't have the latest version and am working on updating that now.

[15:00] *** MasterDuke left
[15:03] <mgoebel> I'm an undergraduate computer science senior at Georgia Tech. I did an Advanced OS course and a Compilers & Interpreters course last spring which were super hard but a ton of fun, but it was definitely just the tip of the iceberg and there's a lot I don't know. I'm most comfortable in C and I don't have a lot of experience with Perl, though I'm working on picking it up.

[15:04] <brrt> Cool.

[15:04] <mgoebel> Are there any write-ups (maybe on the compiler or related things) that might help me tackle the initial learning curve that you could point me towards?

[15:04] <brrt> Well, not everybody here has a lot of experience with perl5, so that's hardly a requirement

[15:05] <brrt> On the rakudo compiler, there's been a bunch of slides

[15:05] <brrt> I can find them

[15:05] <brrt> but to be honest jnthn knows a lot more about those

[15:05] <brrt> I'm mostly the JIT guy around here

[15:06] <brrt> mgoebel: https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course

[15:06] <brrt> this should give you some insight into how things work together

[15:06] <brrt> but it is kind of old and doesn't talk a lot about MoarVM internals

[15:06] <brrt> we have a docs folder, and istr that samcv was at some point busy making online documentation

[15:06] <ggoebel> jnthn: is there a link to an index of your papers?

[15:07] <brrt> ggoebel: http://www.jnthn.net/slides.html there's that

[15:08] <mgoebel> brrt: Thanks! I'll start with that and work from there.

[15:08] <brrt> great

[15:09] <brrt> so I should stress, regarding the linking idea; I looked into this and it seemed doable, but it's not a predetermined path

[15:09] <brrt> and there is at least one complexity still, which is that we use dynamic linking to load some extra, rakudo specific code in the VM (so called extops)

[15:10] <brrt> now.... extops are somewhat deprecated, but they're not gone yet

[15:10] <samcv> brrt, istr?

[15:10] <brrt> 'I seem to recall'

[15:10] <brrt> I recall seeing a documentation website that you built ... times ago

[15:12] <samcv> yeah

[15:12] <samcv> well. that i got like part way done. i thought istr was some op :)

[15:12] <brrt> hehe

[15:12] <samcv> and i didn't remember one called istr() :-)

[15:12] <brrt> could've been

[15:13] <brrt> mgoebel: obviously we have the docs/ directory as well, but I don't think there's much relevant to this case

[15:13] <samcv> brrt, i found malloc_trim() interesting. i had no clue that existed

[15:13] <brrt> samcv: I think that was actually MasterDuke's suggestion; neither did I, btw

[15:14] <samcv> This function is automatically called by free(3) in certain

[15:14] <samcv>        circumstances

[15:16] <samcv> M_TRIM_THRESHOLD default is 128*1024. but somehow

[15:16] <samcv> maybe it just doesn't always get triggered

[15:18] *** patrickb joined
[15:19] <samcv> interestingly there's the MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ ENV var which can change the default M_TRIM_THRESHOLD

[15:30] <samcv> i go from 8.7 max to 6.3 with my script that cats a linux iso 5 times doing malloc_trim(128*1024);

[15:32] <mgoebel> brrt: Good to know, I'll keep an eye out for other ways of doing it as well

[15:32] <mgoebel> I'll work through the rakudo and nqp course and look through the slides and will likely have a lot of questions after that

[15:32] <mgoebel> bbiab

[15:35] <brrt> later

[15:36] <brrt> samcv: that's a fairly big difference
