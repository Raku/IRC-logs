[13:20] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i'm at HEAD of moarperf, but when i load a profile `perl6 -I lib service.p6 <path to .sqlite3>` it seems to load ok, but i just get `There is nothing at this URL. Return` when i open the link

[13:22] *** Altai-man_ joined
[13:22] <MasterDuke> somewhat related, but question for all. why would a profile show a method as not jitted at all, but the spesh log say it was jitted successfully?

[13:25] *** sena_kun left
[13:33] <MasterDuke> could a `# JIT: devirtualized` cause that?

[13:37] *** lucasb joined
[13:42] <timotimo> no that's a good thing

[14:28] *** Geth joined
[14:33] <MasterDuke> another question. why would a method have no interned callsites even though the statistics show a ton of hits for just one?

[14:42] <japhb> MasterDuke: I'm having the same problem in moarperf as well (reported in this channel back on Friday).  At the time timotimo thought it might be an implicit dependency that we're missing that he has installed (and thus doesn't notice).

[14:43] <MasterDuke> i did get some warnings about peer dependencies during the `npm install .` phase. but i don't know anything about npm/js, so i just ignored them. maybe they were really relevant

[14:49] <timotimo> they're pesky; on my machine it still all works >_>

[14:50] <MasterDuke> it did work as of a little while ago

[14:50] *** robertle left
[14:51] <MasterDuke> but i couldn't say exactly which commit

[15:03] <MasterDuke> npm WARN @babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator@7.0.0-beta.53 requires a peer of @babel/core@>=7.0.0-beta.50 <7.0.0-rc.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

[15:03] <MasterDuke> npm WARN @babel/preset-es2017@7.0.0-beta.53 requires a peer of @babel/core@>=7.0.0-beta.50 <7.0.0-rc.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

[15:04] <MasterDuke> npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for [email@hidden.address] wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

[15:05] <MasterDuke> whoops, more text than i expected, probably should have just created an issue

[15:08] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/issues/6

[15:11] <timotimo> fsevents is skipped because it's not needed on linux

[15:14] <MasterDuke> yeah, that one didn't seem likely to be a problem

[15:29] <timotimo> MasterDuke, japhb, can you tell me what "npm run dev" tells you?

[15:29] <timotimo> i have travis-ci doing builds of moarperf and it's working just fine there

[15:30] <MasterDuke> timotimo: in frontend?

[15:30] <timotimo> yes

[15:32] *** robertle joined
[15:32] <MasterDuke> takes so long...

[15:35] <MasterDuke> timotimo: commented on the issue

[15:35] <timotimo> yeah it takes a while

[15:35] <timotimo> but that looks perfect

[15:36] <timotimo> and even then it gives 404 or whatever it is when connecting?

[15:36] <timotimo> what does the service.pm6 log say?

[15:38] <MasterDuke> commented again

[15:41] <timotimo> i don't see a 404 anywhere

[15:45] <japhb> I'm not at that machine, so I can't `npm run dev`.  But I can say it didn't 404; it just gives the error message that MasterDuke and I reported.  It looks like the screen *should* have content (clearly it's using the normal CSS), but it just has the `There is nothing at this URL. Return` error, where the 'Return' bit is a link back to the home page.

[15:55] <MasterDuke> `frontend/index.js:273:                        <Row><Col>There is nothing at this URL. <Link to="/">Return</Link></Col></Row>`

[16:00] * japhb twitches at the replaced HTML tags

[16:08] <timotimo> oh

[16:08] <timotimo> i did not know i had something like that in there, LOL

[16:10] <timotimo> aha, looks like i changed that to just "oh no" locally

[16:10] <timotimo> or revereted a change or something

[16:10] <timotimo> what URL does it show you when you get that?

[16:27] <MasterDuke> http://localhost:20000/#/prof/

[16:29] <timotimo> hm, ok, what moarperf commit are you on?

[16:30] <MasterDuke> commit bfe3a2da952507d7000512edba051268d10838df (HEAD -> master, origin/master)

[16:44] <MasterDuke> timotimo: mostly not related, but you can now change your `use v6.d.PREVIEW;` in service.p6 to `use v6.d;`

[16:44] <timotimo> ah, indeed
