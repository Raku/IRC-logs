[09:58] <nine> God damn it, there's still a regression by my deopt fix uncovered by our work code base

[10:20] <nine> At least I seem to have found a workaround quickly, so the release can be less broken. But I'll continue looking for a proper fix

[10:51] <nine> Could have something to do with exceptions thrown in callbacks. Maybe only when the callback is called from JIT compiled calls to native code

[10:53] <nine> Well it works without JIT

[13:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM:

[13:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: The segfault may happen after returning from a NativeCall callback into JIT

[13:00] <Geth_> Â¦ MoarVM: compiled code, possibly by way of an exception. This workaround seems to get

[22:48] <sena_kun> so, more than 200 modules are checked today... hmm. and blin hang and then, apparently, died. ran it again, will check the rest of failing ones tomorrow morning and it would be awesome (unless we have some issues) to ship a moarvm release tomorrow (oops, "today)

[22:48] <lizmat> still tomorrow here  :-)

[22:48] <sena_kun> :)

[22:49] <sena_kun> I also don't like https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/141e0fcd433a08aafde07466351412b4 a lot

[22:54] <sena_kun> .tell tadzik is https://github.com/tadzik/Module-Toolkit abandoned?

[22:54] <tellable6> sena_kun, I'll pass your message to tadzik
