[08:54] <brrt> I've gotten the floating point support so far as a segfault

[08:54] <brrt> So that's progress

[08:54] <brrt> :-D

[08:59] <jnthn> Congrats or something :)

[08:59] <yoleaux> 00:37Z <vrurg> jnthn: If'm getting right your complaint about NQP in detached head, then the solution would be to use --gen-nqp=master

[08:59] <yoleaux> 01:22Z <vrurg> jnthn: Got the problem reproduced, will have it fixed Monday.

[18:06] <brrt> good afternoon

[18:06] <brrt> google tells me we have very similar weather today

[18:07] <brrt> yay, bug fixed

[18:07] <brrt> I decided to make the register allocator mostly oblivious to the type of register

[18:09] <brrt> and to have the emitter figure it out

[18:09] *** pamplemousse_ joined
[18:09] <brrt> the emitter, after all, can assume it knows all about the target architecture, since it must by definition

[18:15] <brrt> pamplemousse: your network is less than reliably connected

[18:16] <pamplemousse> brrt: It's definitely less than ideal

[18:25] <pamplemousse> I think my wireless card doesn't work very well with the available wireless access point

[21:01] <yoleaux> 13:42Z <vrurg> jnthn: not sure you'd have time to reply this week. In short about the subsets: their current behavior is a bug. It's not like breaking backward compat just for the sake of a new feature.

[22:44] <timotimo> we used to have a server for perl6 devs where they could run an instance of irssi or weechat (though no reason not to allow a traditional bouncer, or a quassel core or what ever else) so that they don't have to worry about getting disconnected from irc

[22:44] <timotimo> but then that machine turned into a very unhealthy snack

[22:45] *** pamplemousse left
[22:50] <timotimo> hm, i suppose it would already have been unhealthy to snack on that machine before it broke

[23:23] <timotimo> yikes

[23:27] <jnthn> We just got a nice bit of rain, and the air is fresher now, at least :)

[23:28] <jnthn> Going to Scandinavia for the next ~week, which should be cooler :)
