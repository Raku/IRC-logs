[17:10] <Kaiepi> can someone review M#1190?

[17:10] <synopsebot> M#1190 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1190 [IP6NS Grant] Close synchronous sockets properly

[18:31] *** MasterDuke joined
[18:38] <dogbert17> Ah, it's MasterDuke

[18:39] <dogbert17> been looking for you :)

[18:39] <MasterDuke> heh. i saw that mention yesterday and wasn't sure why at first

[18:40] <MasterDuke> then figured out it looked like the valgrind problem was called by my more-context-in-error-messages commits

[18:40] <dogbert17> it's about a valgrind issue with t/spec/S17-procasync/encoding.t

[18:40] <dogbert17> try it

[18:41] <MasterDuke> yep, can repro

[18:42] <dogbert17> do you think it's been there all the time or are the changes to the file somehow involved?

[18:43] <dogbert17> btw, I'm looking for timotimo as well regarding another matter :)

[18:44] <MasterDuke> i'm not 100% sure, but it looks like my code is involved, so i would assume it's recent

[18:45] <dogbert17> I believe so although I'm far from certain

[18:48] <MasterDuke> looks like it might be the cast of `MVMGrapheme32 *buffer` into `char *`

[18:48] <dogbert17> if I go back to MoarVM b72a790b1b21c88c the problem vanishes

[18:49] <dogbert17> aha

[19:31] <timotimo> o/

[19:37] <dogbert17> hi timotimo

[19:38] <dogbert17> have a quick question for you?

[19:39] <dogbert17> is this code in use? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/profiler/heapsnapshot.c#L1347

[19:40] <timotimo> only if zstd is detected during Configure.pl time

[19:41] <dogbert17> cppcheck complains about lines 1364-5 claiming that 'entry' is not initialized. Could that be a problem?

[19:52] <timotimo> ha

[19:52] <timotimo> yeah, that could be kind of bad

[19:52] <timotimo> on the other hand, i think entry isn't actually used?

[19:53] <timotimo> does it highlight a place where it's used?

[20:05] <dogbert17> nope, I don't think the tool is that good

[20:10] <timotimo> OK

[20:10] <timotimo> because just looking over the code i couldn't find one

[20:10] <timotimo> was potentially a left-over from copypasting the ver2 functions to make the ver3 ones

[20:57] <MasterDuke> i probably won't have time to work on it again tonight, but the reason i used MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free was because brrt didn't like repeating a free() call in every branch. is there a way to use a cast and/or MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free that won't annoy valgrind?
