[00:02] <MasterDuke> is it the enum or the tc->cur_frame->static_info that's most wrong

[00:06] <timotimo> i think using the cur_frame at the point where profiling is turned on is wrong

[00:10] <MasterDuke> thread_entry_frame?

[00:14] <MasterDuke> nope, that causes a segv

[00:14] <timotimo> sorry, brain is too mush to think

[00:15] <MasterDuke> no worries. but let me know if inspiration strikes in the night

[10:40] <MasterDuke> nine: did you see my question in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/935 ?

[10:54] <timotimo> i somehow totally forgot about the existence of strdup

[11:01] *** lizmat left
[11:05] <MasterDuke> heh

[11:06] <timotimo> so yeah, that's probably the right fix

[11:11] <MasterDuke> k, i'll update the PR

[11:21] *** lizmat joined
[11:25] <timotimo> i wonder if we want to limit it to some upper bound and use strndup

[11:25] <MasterDuke> timotimo: why do all the other MVM_telemetry_interval_* functions just do `record->u.annotation.description = description;`? i.e., directly assign the passed in string

[11:29] *** sena_kun left
[11:29] *** sena_kun joined
[11:31] <timotimo> because those are required to have constant strings

[11:32] <timotimo> i.e. these pointers would point into the read-only section of the libmoar.so

[11:32] <timotimo> pretty much a requirement for good performance, i think

[11:32] <MasterDuke> oh, i see this one is named *_dynamic, didn't even look at the name before

[11:39] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any particular suggestion for a limit?

[11:41] <timotimo> 1024 is probably a very conservative limit

[12:19] <timotimo> don't think so, go ahead if you want

[12:19] <MasterDuke> good, will do

[12:21] <MasterDuke> oh right, Geth isn't working here

[12:25] <MasterDuke> no warnings for me using gcc 8.3.0 now

[12:25] <timotimo> jnthn, can you set up https://geth.svc.tyil.net/ on https://github.com/moarvm/moarvm/settings/hooks/

[12:26] <MasterDuke> still a bunch with clang. mostly `warning: '&&' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]`

[12:26] <timotimo> probably no harm in cleaning that up

[12:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo: also a bunch of `src/debug/debugserver.c:431:1: warning: control may reach end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type] }`
