[17:40] <tellable6> dogbert17, and I oop! Backtrace: https://gist.github.com/768354f07ae2d75a3a8d48f7480c61e1

[17:40] <dogbert17> heh

[17:43] <dogbert17> m: await ^1000 .map: {start '{my $x}'.EVAL}; say "all good"

[18:08] <vrurg> dogbert17: EVAL isn't thread sage, long known issue.

[18:14] <dogbert17> vrurg: I know. just wanted to check with nine since he has, if I remeber correctly, been looking into the 'Decoder may not be used concurrently' issue

[18:15] <dogbert17> *remember

[18:16] <vrurg> Basically, decoder is the only known problem to me. Currently EVAL is utilyzing same compiler instance it gets with getcomp. But it shouldn't be a big deal to create and use a new one.

[18:36] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I saw nine 2019-10-30T19:02:54Z in #raku-dev: <nine> kelly: that's really hard to answer in a general way.

[18:36] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: ↑ :)

[19:42] <dogbert17> so, is it ok for two threads to be garbage collecting at the same time?

[19:43] *** Altai-man_ joined
[19:46] <japhb> That's the normal state of things during a GC run.

[19:46] *** sena_kun left
[19:47] <japhb> (They are properly coordinated for blocked and active threads, too.)

[20:03] <dogbert17> japhb: thx
