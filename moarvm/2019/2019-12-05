[17:53] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: status

[17:53] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in ‚âà10 hours (2019-12-07 UTC-12‚åÅUTC+20). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[18:56] <nine> That's a curious segfault: a sp_guardconc op in a frame without spesh cands and more importantly without effective_spesh_slots

[18:57] <tellable6> 2019-12-05T10:09:07Z #raku-dev <tbrowder> nine thanks!

[19:47] <nine> At least it's apparently not a regression by my NativeCall work. It's reproducible on 2019.07

[19:52] <nine> And 2018.12

[20:00] <nine> But not on 2017.12, so let the bisect begin

[20:52] *** sena_kun left
[21:05] <nine> Darn...when bisecting I run into a range of commits that causes bogus errors like "Attribute $!name not declared in class Inline::Perl5::ClassHOW"

[21:07] *** sena_kun joined
[21:21] <MasterDuke> nine: not easy to use committable/bisectable?

[21:30] <nine> with Inline::Perl5?

[21:35] <MasterDuke> oh, bisecting commits in I:P5?

[21:35] <MasterDuke> that you couldn't do. but you can install modules if you're bisecting rakudo

[21:49] <nine> I am bisecting rakudo. Just curious: how does bisectable handle such broken commits?

[21:57] <nine> Manual selection of commits got me out of the breakage :)

[22:04] <MasterDuke> it doesn't really, just says the output is suspicious. but by manually setting where to start/end you could probably get something useful. or use committable to run over a whole range of commits to see all the different outputs

[22:14] <nine> And the winner is: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3893a6ce8e983ea374a68af2dd095f99cbe588d6

[22:16] <MasterDuke> nice. have a fix?

[22:18] <nine> No, will have a look tomorrow. Now that I know what to look at

[22:27] <nine> Actually I think that commit is innocent. It just unlocks some optimization that breaks things. But the commit should help me find this optimization.

[22:27] <nine> As I can compare spesh dumps with and without it
