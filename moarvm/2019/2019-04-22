[13:31] <lizmat> why is rakudo.org still down?  doesn't jnthn control the DNS for that ?

[13:32] <jnthn> I already did a DNS change for that on, I think, Friday, at the request of timotimo

[13:33] <lizmat> should it point to 134.209.245.173 ?

[13:34] <jnthn> Yes, believe so; that's the same thing that perl6.wakelift.de resolves to

[13:34] <lizmat> hmmm...  134.209.245.173 gives me an nginx message

[13:35] <lizmat> so I guess the cache in my browser has not expired yet

[13:35] <jnthn> curl http://rakudo.org returns the right thing

[13:35] <jnthn> ah, but

[13:35] <jnthn> $ curl https://rakudo.org

[13:35] <jnthn> curl: (7) Failed to connect to rakudo.org port 443: Connection refused

[13:37] <lizmat> for some reason my browser always redirects to the https:// version :-(

[13:37] <jnthn> Ah, maybe HSTS?

[13:37] <jnthn> Going forward, probably we should - among other things - point these various domains at name servers that multiple members of the community have access to modify

[13:37] <lizmat> yes...

[13:38] <jnthn> I'm happy to do that with rakudo.org and moarvm.org once such exists

[13:38] <jnthn> I've no idea of the ownership of perl6.org, and it seems nobody else knows that either...

[13:38] <lizmat> pretty sure that's owned by The Perl Foundation

[13:43] <jnthn> afk for a while
