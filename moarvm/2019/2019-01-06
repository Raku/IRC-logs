[07:50] <brrt> \o

[08:24] <brrt> hmm

[08:25] <brrt> strictly and for consistency, I should probably know when I'm trying emit a store-of-num as a store-of-int

[08:25] <brrt> but. I can also get away with not knowing

[08:25] <brrt> now question is; is that realistic

[08:26] <brrt> the problem is this:

[08:26] <brrt> - I move things like 'const_n64' to use a new 'const_num' operator

[08:27] <brrt> - the const_num operator yields a 'num' type value

[08:28] <brrt> - the 'store' operator doesn't work on  'num' values, so there is a 'store_num' operator introduced as wlel

[08:28] <brrt> so far goes the theory

[08:28] <brrt> the practical implementation is that 'num' type values are mapped to xmm registers

[08:31] <brrt> so that 'store_num' maps to 'movsd [addr], xmm1', 'load_num' to 'movsd xmm0, [addr]' etc

[08:32] <brrt> now, i need to figure out the proper operator type for the automatially assigned store....

[09:10] <brrt> oh, hmm

[09:11] <brrt> local_types and lexical_tyeps are MVMuint16, but all actual values fit in MVMuint8; what's more, MVM_spesh_get_reg_type will give you an MVMint8
