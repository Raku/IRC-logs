[19:07] <brrt> \o

[19:07] <brrt> timotimo++ nice blog

[19:12] <nwc10> o/

[19:12] <timotimo> thank you kindly, dear friend

[19:20] <dogbert17> jnthn: it seems as if commit https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2fe2f588fd931e9bed982da97f352207ddab9e62 breaks a lot of spectests on 32-bit systems, any theories as to why?

[19:20] <dogbert17> could there be a cast missing somewhere

[19:20] <ugexe> thats the one that breaks windows as well

[19:21] <ugexe> maybe some correlation can be made between those two things

[19:24] <dogbert17> ugexe: interesting. stumbled upon it myself when spectesting with libuv 1.29.1. For a while I thought that was the culprit but alas no.

[19:38] <ugexe> lucs came up with this (he was having issues on 32bit as well) https://gist.github.com/lucs/9bf69520a94f8472fdaed4cdcb451973

[19:39] *** brrt left
[19:51] <dogbert17> here's one of the failing tests on 32 bit (should return True): sub dsi($s) { DateTime.new($s).Instant }; say dsi("2005-12-31T23:59:60") < dsi("2006-01-01T00:00:00")

[19:55] <jnthn> I wonder what sizeof(mp_digit) is on the platforms where this doesn't work out...

[20:04] <dogbert17> (gdb) p sizeof(mp_digit)

[20:04] <dogbert17> $1 = 4

[20:24] <jnthn> oops

[20:25] <jnthn> OK, then we need to #ifdef on that, and re-instate the old thing if it's not 8
