[15:10] <tellable6> 2019-12-11T07:15:53Z #moarvm <nine> brrt: I'd be grateful for any such hints! My understanding of the JITs control flow is limited

[15:10] <brrt> uh, I've not been here for a while

[15:10] *** sena_kun joined
[15:19] <nwc10> o/

[15:25] *** brrt left
[15:36] <nine_> brrt: well, I did find it out in the end :) https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/moarvm?date=2019-12-14#l32

[15:36] <tellable6> nine_, I'll pass your message to brrt

[15:38] <nwc10> nine_: The misunderstanding between me and rjbs is now correct, and rjbs kindly did all the dirty work for me and made an IO trial release for the fix we need: https://metacpan.org/changes/release/RJBS/IO-1.41_50

[15:38] <nwc10> er, corrected

[15:38] <nwc10> anway, mor eimportant: http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=IO+1.41_50

[15:38] <nwc10> and I see some red that wasn't there earlier, so mmm....

[15:40] <nwc10> oh, test portability fail and unreleated. eg here's an older version: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/aceced65-6c01-1014-b5c5-1bbe17da2fe0

[15:57] <Guest38485> nine_: did you see that |Tux| had some complaint today as well?

[17:00] <lizmat> Guest38485: I think nine acknowledged and reproduced that ?

[17:09] *** domidumont left
[17:10] *** sena_kun joined
[17:14] <nine_> nwc10: sounds good! Thanks for the heads up

[17:15] <nine_> Guest38485: yes, I think it's just a different symptom of the same issue

[17:19] <nine_> Huh, that's interesting: while I cannot provoke the issue by running the GC more often, it actually does the opposite: with a small nursery I cannot reproduce the issue at all

[17:21] *** nine_ is now known as nine

[17:27] <jnthn> I guess sometimes you can cause a thing to move into gen2 sooner, from which point on it doesn't move, and so "wrong nursery" checks won't fire.

[17:28] <nine> That's a very good hint!

[17:29] <nine> Oddly the errors I get are all at Raku level about wrong types or an unexpected VMNull

[17:29] *** domidumont joined
[17:29] <nine> Most often: Native call expected return type with CPointer representation, but got a P6opaque (Scalar)

[17:30] <jnthn> I assume it's not sensitive to spesh and friends?

[17:30] <nine> Disabling spesh makes it more reproducible

[17:36] <nine> Increasing MVM_NURSERY_SIZE _and_ MVM_NURSERY_THREAD_START drastically makes it go away, too. This kinda confirms the suspicion that it's a GC issue

[17:36] <nine> (as now objects won't move because they stay in the nursery)

[17:36] <nine> Luckily I do have a bit of experience with GC issues :)

[17:37] <nine> But now I have to leave for some fitness training
