[01:57] <timotimo> wow, travis just hit me up with quite an error:

[01:57] <timotimo> *** Error in `/home/travis/.rakudobrew/bin/../moar-master/install/share/perl6/site/bin/zef': corrupted double-linked list: 0x00007fa961591e20 ***

[01:58] <timotimo> was triggered inside of spesh, but of course we can't know when it actually got corrupted

[15:24] <Guest37021> jnthn: in your Perl6 performance speech in Riga you alluded to using some opts which had not yet been released to the mainline. Were you referring to PEA opts or something else?

[15:25] <jnthn> Yes, stuff in moar-pea

[15:28] <Guest37021> cool, is that work in progress?

[15:30] <jnthn> Well, not today, but yes :)

[15:30] <jnthn> I shouldn't be touching anything that needs that much brain today :)

[20:58] <MasterDuke> timotimo: any new ideas about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1023 ?

[21:00] <timotimo> looks like it could be a stack overflow

[21:00] <timotimo> at least the very first one

[21:02] *** zakharyas left
[21:03] <MasterDuke> sometimes it manifests as a segv after the tests finish, and sometimes a `MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 130 in GC work pass` or `===SORRY!===P6opaque: no such attribute '$!restart' on type NQPMu in a Perl6::Grammar when trying to get a value` in the middle of them

[21:03] <timotimo> the very last one looks like a thing jn just recently fixed

[21:03] <timotimo> or is it the thing where we wanted to move that call earlier but didn't do it yet

[21:06] <MasterDuke> the gc-related fix that dogbert was experimenting with?

[21:06] <timotimo> right

[21:08] <MasterDuke> i don't remember the details, did it in fact go in? if not, any particular reason why?

[21:08] <timotimo> just me doing too much pingpong with my head between projects

[21:26] <dogbert17> MasterDuke: what is it that you're running when you get that SEGV?

[21:27] <MasterDuke> p6-mqtt/t/regex.t

[21:27] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Juerd/p6-mqtt

[21:27] * dogbert17 checks

[21:29] <dogbert17> and I get the same error when using --profile

[21:31] <MasterDuke> dogbert17: and does moving that line you and timotimo talked about before change anything?

[21:33] <dogbert17> nope, doesn't look like it

[21:33] <dogbert17> but perhaps I'm moving the line to the wrong place

[21:35] * MasterDuke is afk for a bit

[21:38] <dogbert17> aha - MoarVM panic: Adding pointer 0x7f294a16da38 to past fromspace to GC worklist
