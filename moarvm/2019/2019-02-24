[00:35] <japhb> timotimo: In the Spesh Performance Overview section of https://wakelift.de/2019/02/21/always-wear-safety-equipment-when-inline-scalaring/ , the screenshot shows up to 230% jit ... what does >100% signify?

[00:36] <timotimo> psst! not so loud, or others will notice!

[00:39] <timotimo> seriously though, the frontend just displays what comes out of the backend. you have to ask whoever is responsible for that how that happens

[00:39] <timotimo> what did you say, that's me as well? well, i'll be ...

[00:40] <timotimo> tbh i don't know how that happens either. i did see it, though

[00:43] <japhb> I wondered if it was just a bug (sounds like it might be), or if it signified some special case (like "this code got re-jitted multiple times" or somesuch).

[00:43] <timotimo> at one point i thought it could be due to OSR, but i don't think jumping into osr'd code actually counts up entries at all

[02:40] *** Elronnd joined
[02:44] <Elronnd> are there any resources on embedding moar?  I want to use perl6 as a scripting language, so is there any way to call into moar to simply evaluate a string, rather than providing a filename?

[02:48] <Elronnd> and, how can I compile a .p6 file into a  moarvm file?

[02:54] <Elronnd> I tried perl6 --target=moar on a test file, but it says "Cannot dump this object; no dump method"

[02:55] <Elronnd> (and target=mbc)

[03:03] <Elronnd> oh, I need a --output=.  But how can I run the resultant file?  When I try to I get a "Unhandled exception: Cannot call method 'cli-options' on a null object"

[03:16] <mst> Elronnd: so I am totally ignorant of this, but the perl5 XS module http://p3rl.org/Inline::Perl6 apparently boots moarvm right and fucks with it so it can do that

[03:17] <mst> Elronnd: hopefully somebody with a clue will turn up soon and help you, but that's the one embedding I know about and it definitely works, so maybe you can cargo cult from there until somebody who knows what they're talking about turns up

[03:20] <Elronnd> thanks, I'm looking at that now

[03:20] <Elronnd> I'm not exactly sure that xs is, though, it looks similar enough to c to read, but there are a couple of thing I'm not quite sure of

[03:20] <Elronnd> most importantly, what an SV is

[03:22] <Elronnd> Found this https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs.html but it's not that illuminating

[04:09] <Elronnd> well, I'm stuck

[04:09] <Elronnd> managed to get it running, but spits out this error now https://0x0.st/z-Kx.txt

[12:15] <nine> Oh, I just noticed that merge_bbs is no longer active. That's probably hurting the expr jit :/

[12:30] <timotimo> Elronnd: the first problem you're running into is that moar has to be invoked with the path to the perl6 extension ops; check what's in "perl6-m", it's a shell script

[12:31] <timotimo> but in general, what perl6 --target=mbc spits out isn't runnable as a stand-alone program, i think?

[12:31] <nine> It isn't

[12:32] <timotimo> i imagine the first problem is that the code would have to have code in it to find the ModuleLoader and from that the core setting and all that

[12:33] <timotimo> perl6 --target=mbc is at the moment the same thing we use to precompile modules; precomped modules are already big enough without having "make me stand-alone code" stuff in it :(

[12:33] <timotimo> of course that doesn't mean there can't be a perl6-make-executable-moar-bytecode-file foo.p6 that does the necessary things

[12:37] <nine> IIRC pmurias++ and/or ugexe++ have gotten pretty close to get that working already

[12:47] <brrt> ohai

[12:47] <brrt> oh btw, nine++ for fixing the JIT nativecall bug :-)

[12:48] <nine> :)

[12:49] <brrt> does anybody know if there's any response regarding TPFs GSoC application?

[14:23] <MasterDuke> timotimo: in the "Optimization" tab, it might be good to explain the difference between "Deopt One" and "Deopt All"

[14:31] <MasterDuke> timotimo: have you thought at all about if/how to support opening multiple profiles? and possibly comparing them?

[14:37] <timotimo> i want to have that in at some point, yeah

[14:37] <MasterDuke> e.g., i frequently create multiple profiles (e.g., stock rakudo, modified rakudo, v1 of whatever i'm profiling, v2 of whatever i'm profiling, etc) and open them all up in the browser and switch between tabs to compare

[14:37] <timotimo> fortunately i had enough sense in me to not put that in the original list of deliverables for the grant

[14:38] <MasterDuke> heh

[14:38] <MasterDuke> i assume the easiest way to do that right now is start a new moarperf for each one on a different port?

[14:38] <timotimo> yeah

[14:38] <timotimo> though it'd be very easy to just separate them by a path on the server side

[14:39] <timotimo> putting support for a "base url" into the profiler frontend could be a bit of tedious work, though, or it could be very easy :)

[14:39] <timotimo> that'd save a little bit of ram at least :)

[14:40] <MasterDuke> should i create an issue in the repo?

[14:41] <timotimo> could be good for tracking it

[14:46] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/issues/1

[15:15] *** domidumont left
[17:18] <Elronnd> nine: no because MVM_interp_run wants an MVMThreadContext*, not an MVMStaticFrame*

[17:19] <Elronnd> timotimo: perl6 and perl6-m are exactly the same thing on my system

[17:19] <timotimo> yes

[17:19] <timotimo> if you have --backends=jvm,moar then perl6-j and perl6 will be the same

[17:19] <timotimo> it uses what's first in the --backends list

[17:20] <Elronnd> I was trying to do what inline::perl6 does, which is to use moar to start perl6 to run perl6 code, because that seems more feasible.  But that's what's not seeming to work

[17:21] <timotimo> you can look at moar's main.c file to see how an MVMInstance and its initial MVMThreadContext get created

[17:21] <Elronnd> looking there

[17:21] <MasterDuke> timotimo: how difficult would it be for moarperf to support old profiles? i.e., those without a 'replaced' field/column?

[17:22] <timotimo> it should already support a profile without 'replaced'; are you getting an error?

[17:24] <MasterDuke> timotimo: https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/edf3d31dca91613908b283b14bc2329d

[17:26] <timotimo> pushed a fix

[17:27] <MasterDuke> timotimo: also, i just got a big red frowny face in the optimization tab

[17:27] <timotimo> mhm

[17:28] <Elronnd> well, I got a perl6 shell copying moar's main.c.  But I want to have some way to say p6eval("say 'hello world';");, which I assume (?) can come from using moar to call into perl6 internals functions?

[17:29] <MasterDuke> oh, refreshed and now it's fine

[17:29] <timotimo> Elronnd: evaling code is something more high-level; you'll want to have some code that, for example, listens on a queue or something and reacts to that

[17:30] <Elronnd> like, putting it on a different threat?

[17:30] <timotimo> yeah, i'd say so

[17:30] <Elronnd> I'm not sure if I want to do that bc then tls might get in the way

[17:31] <timotimo> otherwise you can have moar NativeCall into your function as a callback and it'll return to your code

[17:37] <Elronnd> oh, wait, that might actually work a lot better

[17:38] <Elronnd> because I can send the addresses of my functions from perl6 to c and then call them from there

[17:38] <Elronnd> hell, can just send over an EVAL

[17:40] *** Kaiepi left
[17:50] <nine> Inline::Perl6 uses the route via NativeCall

[17:52] <nine> Elronnd: I don't understand your answer. I meant that line 52 should read in full: MVM_interp_run(ret->tc, init_frame, ret->cu->body.deserialize_frame);

[17:53] <Elronnd> ohhhhh, I see

[17:53] <Elronnd> yeah, you're right

[17:56] <Elronnd> I'm struggling to get functions from p6 to c.  I have a c library with void (*p6_say_hello)(int); void set_p6_hello(void *hello) { p6_say_hello = hello; }, and then from p6 I said sub set_p6_hello(&fun (int32)) is native("perl6-c") { ... } sub p6_say_hello(int32) is native("perl6-c") { * } sub say_hello(int32 $n) { say "Hiya!!  I'ma perl6 ;o ($n)"; }, but when I do set_p6_hello &say_hello and then

[17:56] <Elronnd> p6_say_hello 7, I get a segfault

[17:58] <Elronnd> seems like that _should_ be fine syntax for passing callbacks according to https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/day-21-nativecall-backs-and-beyond-c/

[18:01] *** lucasb left
[18:10] <nine> Elronnd: that looks pretty correct. However, that's not the whole program, so I guess the error is in the rest :)

[18:14] <MasterDuke> timotimo: a --profile of `zef info zef` gives wildly wrong numbers in the routines tab. e.g., hash2identity taking 55,340,232,221,127.82ms with only 3 entries

[18:14] <timotimo> yes, zef uses "exit", and that makes the profiler extremely unhappy

[18:14] <MasterDuke> anything i could do to get more sane numbers?

[18:15] <timotimo> sadly, removing "exit" from zef is an arduous task

[18:17] <MasterDuke> hm, this is where a coverage log could be useful, to see what exits are actually getting hit...

[18:17] <Elronnd> nine: this is all my code http://sprunge.us/VEfZYv (and https://0x0.st/z-bY.txt).  Segfaults every time

[18:19] <timotimo> MasterDuke: or wrapping "exit" with printing a stack trace :)

[18:19] <timotimo> actually, i think you can set &*EXIT to something else?

[18:19] <Elronnd> ahhhhhh, I can't call the function pointer

[18:19] <timotimo> m: my &*EXIT = -> |c { say "haha, fooled you" }; exit 1

[18:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 616b757a4: OUTPUT: «haha, fooled you␤»

[18:19] <Elronnd> but I can call it fine from c

[18:19] <MasterDuke> MVM_COVERAGE_LOG=c.log p6 -I lib/ bin/zef info zef gives an immediate segv

[18:20] <timotimo> well, that sounds bad

[18:20] <timotimo> BBIAB

[18:20] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/594b6b414363cffacb2f4e38c1900b8d

[18:21] <nine> Elronnd: ooh...yes, now I see it, too

[18:22] <nine> Elronnd: this would work: void (*wrapped_p6_say_hello)(int); void p6_say_hello(int n) { wrapped_p6_say_hello(n); } void set_p6_hello(void *hello) { wrapped_p6_say_hello = hello; }

[18:23] <Elronnd> yes, that's how I got it to work

[18:23] <Elronnd> bit annoying that it needs the indirection but

[18:23] <Elronnd> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[18:23] <Elronnd> small price to pay

[18:23] <Elronnd> now all I need is a way to dynamically make variables/variable names (since I can't EVAL them in without annoying hacks that just might work)

[18:24] <nine> Well, storing pointers to Perl 6 functions in C just to call them from Perl 6 seems like a bit of a useless redirection anyway

[18:25] <Elronnd> yeah true, I'm mainly going to be calling them _from_ c
