[19:30] <ugexe> hmm so close() can return EINTR

[19:30] <ugexe> same with open

[19:30] <ugexe> but syncfile.c doesn't appear to handle those cases

[19:33] <ugexe> libuv's uv_fs_open|close doesn't either

[19:33] <ugexe> The close call was interrupted by a signal. See Interrupted Primitives. Here is an example of how to handle EINTR properly:

[19:33] <ugexe> TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (close (desc));

[19:34] <nwc10> although I was surprised, so went for a read, and the linux man page also says

[19:34] <nwc10> Note  that  the  return  value should only be used for diagnostics.  In

[19:34] <nwc10> particular close() should not be retried after an EINTR since this  may

[19:34] <nwc10>        cause a reused descriptor from another thread to be closed.

[19:34] <ugexe> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20218924 -- this is why i started looking around

[19:38] <ugexe> definitely seems retrying on EINTR on linux is not what one should do https://lwn.net/Articles/576478/
