[12:43] *** zakharyas joined
[12:43] <nwc10> I didn't check *that* too carefully. It still "finishes" with a DU error report

[12:46] <jnthn> Aha, yeah, managed to get it with that combo. Hmm.

[12:46] <nwc10> but it wins, not ASAN

[12:46] <jnthn> Not sure the last one should matter but thought I'd done the previous two

[12:46] <jnthn> bah, I typo'd one of them :P

[12:47] <jnthn> hmm, it's sticking the materialization in a slightly naughty place

[12:48] <jnthn> Though not sure why that'd make the DU chain wrong

[12:57] <jnthn> Ohhh...ouch

[12:58] <jnthn> It materializes the object in two different branches

[13:00] <jnthn> Thus writing it on both sides into the very same register

[13:00] <jnthn> Same version, even.

[13:02] <jnthn> I wonder if that's even safe. Hm.

[13:03] <jnthn> Ah, it is, I think. But how on earth to deal with the SSA versioning.

[13:25] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: the unused log guard elimination *after* it. Further, PEA removes some

[13:26] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: guards, so it makes sense to clean up deopt after it. Caveat: we might

[13:26] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: produce more deopt point data that we never use during PEA, but I think

[13:26] <Geth> Â¦ MoarVM/more-pea: that's mostly a small waste of memory/analysis time rather than
