[07:26] <patrickb> .tell timotimo For the record: --no-relocatable does not change the runner to be a shell script again. The things it changes are:

[07:26] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[07:27] <patrickb> .tell timotimo - link libmoar with an absolute path.

[07:27] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[07:28] <patrickb> .tell timotimo - Set NQP_HOME and PERL6_HOME to an absolute path and do not try to determine them at run time.

[07:28] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[07:39] <jnthn> Kaiepi: Only MVMObject (though there are many kinds of this), MVMSTable, and sometimes MVMFrame (depending on if it's been heap-promoted)

[07:39] <yoleaux> 14 Apr 2019 09:13Z <nine> jnthn: I only got that line number with --ll-exception in the first place.

[07:39] <jnthn> Kaiepi: MVMThreadContext certainly can not be :)

[07:53] <patrickb> jnthn: On master there are no shell runners left in the install directory. `perl6`, `perl6-m`, `perl6-debug-m` are all real executables. `nqp` is still a shell script.

[07:54] <patrickb> jnthn: In the build directory things are different. In there shell scripts are still generated, because the binary runners don't work in the build dir (without fiddling).

[07:59] <jnthn> patrickb: The shell scripts don't seem to entirely work either, though (without make install)

[07:59] <jnthn> patrickb: They seem to pick up on parts of the installed version

[07:59] <patrickb> jnthn: Oh! That's no good.

[08:00] <patrickb> I'll have a look at that.

[08:09] <jnthn> Thanks. It'll make life a bit hard if I manage to break things enough that `make install` fails - which, given some of the things I work on, I'm somewhat liable to do :)

[10:46] <timotimo> afl was very quick to figure out how to segfault immediately in MVM_frame_initial_invoke by getting tc->cur_frame to become null somehow, and MVM_FRAME_IS_ON_CALLSTACK doesn't null pointer check

[10:47] <timotimo> we could introduce an acronym "AFLHF"

[23:58] <patrickz> .tell jnthn I attempted a fix for the runners in the build dir not working. What I found out: They were dependent on CWD and only worked with CWD = build dir. The install path was and still is included as a lib dir in those runners, because they need NQP which is located in the same dir. I changed the include order though, so the files in the build dir are preferred.

[23:58] <yoleaux> patrickz: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[23:58] <patrickz> .tell jnthn I put the changes in https://github.com/patzim/rakudo/tree/fix-build-runners
