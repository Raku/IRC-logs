[12:58] <timotimo> good news on the laptop. i just took it apart and removed the internal battery and now it starts when no batteries are in but it's connected to the mains

[12:59] *** lizmat joined
[13:00] <nwc10> glad to hear this - this is a lot better than it could have been

[13:03] *** lizmat_ left
[13:03] <masak> timotimo: phew!

[13:06] <timotimo> just now i'm told there's actually a button that allows you to disconnect the internal battery without taking the device apart

[13:06] <timotimo> it's a tiny hole in the underside that you can push a needle through

[13:08] *** ggoebel joined
[13:12] <ggoebel> timotimo: for ~$300 you can pick up a thinkpad t460 w/ >8GB RAM, SSD, and 1600x900 or better display off ebay w/ close to a year left on a 3 year corporate warranty. With the thinkpad keyboard and build quality... That is better than pretty much anything you can buy new at the same price point.

[13:18] <masak> or at least that's what the Thinkpad/eBay-industrial complex would have you believe

[13:19] <timotimo> i'm not sure i can live with less than 16 gigs of ram :)

[13:26] <ggoebel> there's one on ebay now w/ 16GB at $320 + $23 shipping... resolution is only 1366x768 though... It'd cost ~$75 to do the DIY 1080p upgrade. If you're patient... you can find one with both the display and ram you need for around $300. Or step back to a t450 and you'll have a better selection.

[13:28] <nwc10> timotimo: but you can live without a battery?

[13:28] <ggoebel> lug around a UPS :-)

[13:32] <timotimo> nwc10: don't have to. i already plugged it back in and it just works again

[13:33] <timotimo> apparently it just got into some battery-backed state that was unhappy, and unplugging both batteries made it just reset to normal

[13:35] <nwc10> \o/

[13:35] <nwc10> I hope that this is a happy outcome that doesn't revert

[13:43] <timotimo> same

[13:43] <timotimo> if i can bridge another year with this device, surely there'll be quite cheap thinkpads that even pack a little bit of punch in the GPU department

[13:44] <timotimo> at some point, there'll have to be GPGPU modules for perl6

[13:44] <timotimo> though tbh i could already develop those on my desktop, surely; a GTX 1060 should support all basic things, right?

[13:45] <lizmat> timotimo: what are you using for that ?

[13:55] *** lizmat_ joined
[13:55] <timotimo> using for what?

[13:56] *** lizmat__ joined
[13:56] <lizmat__> timotimo: "i could already develop those on my desktop"

[13:56] <timotimo> i'm not sure i understand the question. you mean like OpenCL vs CUDA or something like that?

[13:56] <lizmat__> yeah, I guess >

[13:56] <lizmat__> ?

[13:57] <timotimo> i haven't started at all :)

[13:57] <lizmat__> ahhh...  ok  :-(   :-)

[13:58] <timotimo> until then, continuing work on SSE vectorization ops could be interesting

[20:43] <brrt> ohai samcv

[20:43] <brrt> how is it that every time that I finally have time for moarvm, I'm already tired :-(

[20:44] <brrt> how are you?

[20:44] <brrt> hows' the rain in amsterdam? 'round here, it's wet

[20:45] <jnthn> Where is the rain not wet? :)

[20:49] <brrt> ohai jnthn

[20:49] <brrt> how was Munich?

[20:50] <samcv> heya brrt

[20:50] <samcv> i feel the same since i got here. though i'm way less tired now since i'm now settled. this is the 2nd week on my real™ team

[20:51] <brrt> what team is that?

[20:52] <samcv> soylent. it's the team that owns the PII interface

[20:52] <samcv> (personally indentifiable information)

[20:52] <brrt> oh, cool

[20:52] <brrt> I, well, used to know people who used to be on that team

[20:53] <samcv> this and calango team are the two my onboarding lead recommended. also i'll get to use my unicode knowledge. since dev machines don't get real PII data

[20:53] <samcv> they get or should get fake/scrambled data

[20:53] <samcv> and i need to someday make it better

[20:53] <brrt> I wrote the soylent bulk mapper. Is that still a thing?

[20:53] <samcv> ah

[20:53] <samcv> maybe. were you on the soylent team? or before it was its own team?

[20:54] <brrt> no, I was on EMK

[20:54] <brrt> we had a bunch of PII that was not mapped neatly to database records

[20:54] <brrt> so we needed to transform that in bulk

[20:54] <samcv> emailk?

[20:54] <samcv> or what

[20:54] <brrt> email marketing

[20:55] <samcv> yeah. that's still like

[20:55] <samcv> least elegant part of soylent atm

[20:55] <brrt> it used references and aliasing. it was slightly evil. I'm unreasonably proud of that code

[20:55] <brrt> hehehee

[20:55] <samcv> s/atm/forever

[20:57] <samcv> brrt, they're still the biggest ab(user) of our systems

[20:57] <samcv> well. maybe not biggest. but like storage space i guess

[20:57] <brrt> ouch

[20:58] <brrt> yeah, EMK is necessarily very PII heavy

[20:59] <brrt> anyway.... ehm. I've thought long and hard about the missing ancestor problem.

[20:59] <brrt> I've decided that if the expression IR doesn't have an implicit order, and any operator can reference any value, then from the expression IR's perspective, missing ancestors aren't a problem.

[21:00] <brrt> The expression IR doesn't promise any particular ordering invariant, other than that provided by `DO`

[21:00] <brrt> So in that sense, it is strictly a code generation bug

[21:02] <brrt> arguably, the code generator is well-placed to figure out if it would be emitting such a value

[21:02] <brrt> (or reference)

[21:06] <brrt> so the second thing I've also been thinking about, is to compile all the conditional structures (IF/WHEN/ALL/ANY) to a single COND structure

[21:06] <brrt> in the template preprocessor

[21:06] <brrt> the reasoning being that a single COND structure is much easier to analyze, in terms of control flow, than the combination of the above

[21:18] <jnthn> brrt: Munich was nice. My talks went alright. There was company, food, and beer. :)

[21:19] <brrt> I'd expect beer at least :-)

[21:19] <jnthn> brrt: I guess at that level one general structure is nice, in that it's less cases to consider, though maybe it makes other things harder.

[21:19] <brrt> compilation of the DAG becomes slightly harder

[21:20] <brrt> because, eh, well, at that point the conditional blocks aren't a nice tree shape anymore

[21:22] <brrt> and the conditions need to be compiled in a series, and the code blocks after, and it's a bit of a tangle

[21:22] <brrt> but comparatively manageable

[21:23] <MasterDuke> oh hey, while people are here. i mentioned this earlier, but only timotimo was around. there's a change i'll be able to go to either perlcon eu or the swiss perl workshop. any recommendations either way? one consideration is the actual conference, another is stuff to see/do at the location

[21:23] <brrt> I don't have recommendations.

[21:23] <brrt> I haven't been to SPW

[21:24] <brrt> I've been to a (small) number of perlcons

[21:24] <brrt> but I'm just hoping to have time (and energy) to go this year

[21:26] <jnthn> I'll certainly be at PerlCon. I find travel things quite tiring, and SPW is very soon after PerlCon, so I'm less likely to do that this year. Riga is a nice city; not huge, but nice. Olten is also pretty nice, though of course vastly more expensive; it's easy in Switzerland to go see other nearby places by train though, and there's lots of them. :)

[21:28] <MasterDuke> hm, if significantly more perl6 people are going to be at perlcon eu than spw (and riga is nice) i may try to make that one work first

[21:51] <brrt> ^ rebases

[21:58] <japhb> brrt: What keeps you from committing some of this partial work to master?

[21:58] <yoleaux> 13 Mar 2019 07:53Z <ab6tract> japhb: Did you get my email about the future of Terminal::Print? I sent it to the account listed in the perl6 contributors doc.

[21:58] <brrt> japhb: I hate buts

[21:58] <brrt> *bugs

[21:58] <brrt> and in the case of jit-expr-float, I know there are some incomplete things

[21:59] <brrt> but they are relatively small, so I should really get them finished

[21:59] <japhb> .tell ab6tract No, I hadn't noticed that, though it's been a while since I checked all my mail accounts and folders.  I'll see if I can find it.

[21:59] <yoleaux> japhb: I'll pass your message to ab6tract.

[21:59] <brrt> and in the case of the jit-expr-optimizer, I know that it introduces a very interesting bug (the one I'm supposed to blog about)

[22:00] <brrt> and in the case of the expr-jit-invoke, it pessimizes the jit-nativecall that nine++ built

[22:00] <brrt> so 'incompleteness'

[22:01] <brrt> and what makes me especially nervous around the floating point branch is that I have no real way of testing it

[22:01] <japhb> Ah, gotcha.

[22:01] <brrt> but the question is a fair one

[22:01] <japhb> Yes please!  :-)
