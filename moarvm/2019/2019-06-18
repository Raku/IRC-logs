[16:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/configurable-subsystems: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2ed42f0384

[16:15] <timotimo> should i merge this to master even though the validator isn't strict enough to actually prevent programs that might crash?

[16:15] *** pamplemousse_ left
[16:31] <brrt> there's a certain amount of 'if you're holding it wrong, you're an idiot' element to the profiler configurer?

[16:31] *** pamplemousse_ joined
[16:32] *** pamplemousse__ joined
[16:34] *** pamplemousse left
[16:35] <timotimo> there is, but if there's something in moarvm that can crash it, and it's not optional, then it could be abused?

[16:35] <timotimo> though if you're able to put arbitrary code in which would be necessary to load a confprog, then you'd already be able to just nativecast a null pointer and write/read

[16:35] *** pamplemousse_ left
[16:44] <timotimo> anyway, the confprog-compiler will actually be usable in a few minutes :)

[16:44] <timotimo> since until now there wasn't a commandline utility, you had to write a tiny stub that spurts the result of ConfprogCompiler.compile to a file

[16:45] * timotimo pushed it to cpan

[16:45] <timotimo> i wonder if it would be fine to have geth report on the confprog compiler in here?

[16:49] * lizmat would be fine with that  :-)

[16:52] <timotimo> Geth: help

[16:52] <Geth> timotimo, Source at https://github.com/perl6/geth To add repo, add an 'application/json' webhook on GitHub pointing it to http://hack.p6c.org:8888/?chan=#perl6 and choose 'Send me everything' for events to send | use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes

[16:53] <timotimo> m: say "#".ord.fmt("%x")

[16:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar f05b1b080: OUTPUT: «23␤»

[16:54] <timotimo> that's not entirely correct, eh?

[16:58] <lizmat> looks ok to me

[16:59] <lizmat> timotimo: what's wrong with that ?

[16:59] <timotimo> that url doesn't work :)

[17:00] <timotimo> we could put something in geth that, a little after startup, it will try to send something to the URL configured in it, and checks if anything arrives

[17:01] <lizmat> ah...  :-)

[17:01] <lizmat> guess I was triggered by my recent work on sprintf

[17:03] <timotimo> ah, haha

[17:03] <timotimo> i can totally see why you would have read it as that

[19:19] <dogbert17> hi samcv, are you up for a mystery?

[19:21] <dogbert17> could the following gist be something for you? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/74e32577f8f79b368e3785fd7d4e0008

[19:46] <japhb> Waaaaahh!

[19:46] <timotimo> haha

[19:46] <timotimo> i'd like to file a complaint

[19:46] <MasterDuke> timotimo: cool. however, bunch of format string warnings

[19:47] <timotimo> whaaaaaat

[19:48] <timotimo> my gcc is too lenient

[19:49] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/70825b724df7501b8b82737e02a3fcc3

[19:49] <MasterDuke> gcc (Ubuntu 8.3.0-6ubuntu1) 8.3.0

[19:50] <timotimo> would you mind just putting those changes in for me? :)

[19:50] <MasterDuke> i probably can in a bit

[19:51] * MasterDuke is currently trying to get credit cards sorted out. turns out moving to the uk is complicated, who knew?

[19:53] <nwc10> when moving *from* the UK I solved thjis particular problem by already having an Amex card

[19:54] <nwc10> as I'd been told some years earlier that (effectively) the left hand and the right hand of American Express are capable of talking to each other

[19:54] <timotimo> i'll try fixing all these format strings

[19:54] <nwc10> but you might need a time machine now to take advantage of this info

[19:55] <timotimo> hm. what should confprog do when you divide by zero ...

[19:55] <timotimo> it doesn't have an exception mechanism

[19:55] <MasterDuke> the cards do work (including the amex), but it's the chip+pin that's tricky. currently ours cards require a signature, which throws everybody for a loop

[19:56] <timotimo> i recently got a little culture shock when i heard that there's places in the US where people don't pump their own gas at gas stations

[19:56] <timotimo> you're not from a place anything like that, right?

[19:56] <MasterDuke> nope, but have visited those. odd

[19:58] <lizmat> timotimo: yeah, have seen that as well

[19:58] <lizmat> fwiw, there are a few gas stations like that in NL as well... but not many (anymore)

[19:59] <nwc10> not all of Europe is equal - other places get confused when they *don't* need a signature on a credit card

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: fix format strings; jump out of confprog on div by 0

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM:

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: confprog doesn't handle exceptions in its interpreter, so

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: it's a bad idea to throw one.

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6380013519

[20:14] <MasterDuke> timotimo: still a bunch (gist updated)

[20:51] <timotimo> i'll have to bump nqp's moarvm dependency for the op so the "read confprog" stuff can go in there

[20:51] <timotimo> does somebody have the nice script set up that generates the good commit messages, too?

[20:52] <timotimo> that could totally be a useful irc bot function

[21:08] <MasterDuke> timotimo: doesn't Zoffix's z script do that?

[21:11] <timotimo> it does

[21:11] <timotimo> but my perl6 dev folder layout doesn't match what it wants

[21:17] <timotimo> time to invoke moarperf after a perl6 rebuild %)

[21:43] <timotimo> hrmpf. the example code i'm running also does the "lost sequence in continuation control" thing

[21:45] <timotimo> but at least now that nqp-m and perl6-m let me pass a confprog on the commandline, things are easier to debug
