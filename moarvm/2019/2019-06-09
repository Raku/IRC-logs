[00:55] <MasterDuke> ugh, still getting `MoarVM panic: Internal error: zeroed target thread ID in work pass` when trying to --profile-stage=parse the rakudo build

[01:32] <Kaiepi> finished my work on openbsd's libuv port upgrade! fingers crossed i don't have to do any more on it before i can get moarvm upgraded after the next release

[12:12] * lizmat wonders how difficult it would be to JIT nqp::strfromcodes  ?

[12:35] *** ggoebel joined
[12:58] <ugexe> looks pretty straight forward

[12:59] *** squashable6 left
[13:00] <ugexe> you could just use e.g. typeparameterized as a template for the graph.c and core_templates.expr bits

[13:59] <brrt> I'm going to rid myself of the MVM_JIT_STORAGE_GPR / MVM_JIT_STORAGE_FPR hack

[13:59] <brrt> because, the register id itself already encodes the regiser class

[14:04] <brrt> hmm, that doesn't entirely work.

[14:04] <brrt> ok, well, new plan

[14:05] <timotimo> did anybody go ahead on strfromcodes yet?

[14:05] <jnthn> No tme :)

[14:05] <brrt> no, not me

[14:06] <brrt> there's actually a bunch of PRs that I haven't looked at

[14:06] <brrt> that are probably good

[14:08] <timotimo> ugexe: thank you

[14:09] <brrt> jnthn: it depends, I think

[14:09] <brrt> we sometimes have intermittent failure

[14:09] <timotimo> i think at that point windows wasn't building at all

[14:09] <timotimo> ===SORRY!===

[14:09] <timotimo> 911Please use --backends or --gen-moar

[14:10] <jnthn> Hm, can we run it again?

[14:10] <timotimo> i'll try

[14:10] <jnthn> I can't find the button to do so

[14:10] <timotimo> ok it's re-running

[14:11] <timotimo> it's in samcv's namespace, so perhaps you just don't have permissions there

[14:11] <brrt> seen samscv

[14:11] <timotimo> it's supposed to be on the page that says "MoarVM", then the tab list with "Current build" and the jobs at the far bottom

[14:11] <brrt> what's that command....

[14:11] <brrt> .seen samcv

[14:11] <yoleaux> I saw samcv 25 May 2019 17:54Z in #perl6-dev: <samcv> the bad error message wasn't very helpful though

[14:12] <timotimo> now who was it who was trying to get that PR tested on windows with me

[14:12] <timotimo> was it you, ugexe?

[14:13] <timotimo> anyway, it'll take about 4 more minutes for the other appveyor build to finish, then the mp_set one ought to start

[14:13] <ugexe> yep

[14:13] <timotimo> maybe it's necessary to rebase that pullrequest on latest master before restarting appveyor's attempt

[14:19] <timotimo> OK the mp_set pr is building now
