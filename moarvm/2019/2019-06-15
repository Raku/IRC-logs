[10:36] <brrt> \o

[10:40] <brrt> idk if geth worked, but I got the segv's to stop in floating point compilation

[10:40] <brrt> now..... all that is still needed, is to actually get correct results

[11:11] <brrt> ... and it'd be really, really handy, if the code for getting jit dumps would work as well

[13:37] <MasterDuke> maybe a way to get some free fuzzing for moarvm? https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/53a42e6268bca45c42c54aba3ee70c433a58dc83?utm_source=anzwix

[14:15] <pamplemousse> o/

[14:16] <pamplemousse> I have a new post about progress on the linker: https://yakshavingcream.blogspot.com/2019/06/building-elf-file.html

[14:27] <MasterDuke> pamplemousse: nice. minor typo, ` script call "_start"`, i assume should be 'called'

[14:28] <pamplemousse> Thanks, I'll fix that

[15:58] <mornfall> (not sure what pamlemousse is trying to do, but from a quick scan of the post, replacing _start sounds needlessly complicated)

[16:01] <mornfall> (it should be entirely possible to write a simple stub in C that hands off to perl6 or moarvm or whatever... and the ELF file can be built with ld and a simple linkscript or even with objcopy)

[16:03] <mornfall> (with the benefit of working on any reasonable POSIX system ... hacking _start means reimplementing crt0.o which is different on every arch/os combination)
