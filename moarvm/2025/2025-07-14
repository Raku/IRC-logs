[02:02] <Voldenet> if subs can be garbage collected if they're not reachable, then keeping them around is just a result of having to keep compiler around

[02:05] <Voldenet> so maybe it'd be reasonable that to use internals, one would have to explicitly say `use Rakudo::Compiler` or something similar

[02:06] <Voldenet> and with no namespaces imported in a file (e.g. empty file with `loop { }`), nearly everything could get garbage collected eventually

[02:10] <Voldenet> other way would be something like `use nothing` that would explicitly not reference anything else after compilation

[02:11] <Voldenet> so `say Metamodel` would work and `say ::("Metamodel")` wouldn't

[02:18] <Voldenet> so in the perfect world, it'd be possible to, after inlining and speshing every single line, discard everything but the asm and compiled bytecode for runtime error handling

[02:20] <Voldenet> maybe it'd be a good direction to pursue if reducing allocated memory was important
