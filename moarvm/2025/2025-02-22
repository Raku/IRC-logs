[06:00] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: gdb string pretty printer improvement

[06:00] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2dda0262c4

[06:00] <timo> ^- i decided it's fine to push this to main since the gdb plugin is kind of non critical to releasing

[13:43] <MasterDuke> for getrusage (and maybe other things also) we could provide an MVM_VMArray_bind_pos_i like we just did with at_pos_i, since it already checks that the repr and slot_type are correct

[14:09] <MasterDuke> only saves 0.21s off doing 10m nqp::getrusage though. ~2.51s to ~2.30s

[14:15] <MasterDuke> on my desktop time to do 1m nqp::getrusage drops from ~0.655 to ~0.615s

[16:32] <patrickb> Current plan: Get a libuv PR up (I believe I have it working on Windows soon). Then have a patched libuv until the PR is in. In addition keep the hacky non-libuv posix only PTY impl in moar. Use that when using an external libuv.

[16:34] <patrickb> This will give us PTY support everywhere, except for external libuv on Windows (which no one does anyways). As soon as the libuv patch is upstream I'll remove all the ugly hacks.

[17:52] <ugexe> it does feel slightly less worse using a custom fork if it is based on a PR in the upstream repo

[17:52] <ugexe> 👍 from me

[18:01] <patrickb> To be clear, I never intended to have a permanent patch without a PR. I just suspect it'll be a long time before said PR is gonna be merged.

[18:59] <jdv> .tell MasterDuke  looks like your forgot to add rapidhash to the release bit of the makefile

[18:59] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[19:15] <lizmat> jdv: is that a blocker ?

[19:15] <jdv> nah, i just fouled up my repo wrt submodules...  i'll get it:)

[19:16] <lizmat> *phew*

[20:12] <timo> i think we could reduce the frequency of getrusage calls to half what it is right now and not lose too much precision?
