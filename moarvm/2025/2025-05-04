[19:00] <timo> i can't use rr to record execution of armel from an arm64 host because it's not supported. i can't load the snapshot i saved from my virt-manager with the qemu commandline in order to try its own record&replay implementation either …

[19:38] <timo> qemu-system's own record&replay implementation doesn't support multi-core systems …

[21:09] <timo> i'll first try and see if a core dump looks more reasonable when run without qemu-user

[21:51] <timo> when i kill a nqp-m manually with a SIGABRT from the outside, at least the program counter lives in a place that has bytes and not just zeroes

[22:20] <timo> the crash hasn't reproduced in a while even with parallel tests …
