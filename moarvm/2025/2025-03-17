[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Avoid segfault in GC with nqp::objectid

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: When we generate an objectid, we just reserve some space in gen2 and use

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: the pointer as the stable object id. However, the object does not

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: immediately get moved there. Thus that space remains uninitialized

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: (zeroed out). When the GC collects that space (because the object went

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: away) and tries to run finalizers, we segfault trying to get that

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Avoid mis-spesh of routines with multiple slurpies of the same kind

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Whether it's through language constructs of questionable legality like

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: sub foo (*@a, *@a) or compiler inefficiencies that make it declare an

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: implicit %_ despite there being a capture argument, it's possible that a

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: routine has multiple slurpy arguments of the same kind. Spesh doesn't do

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: well with those, so bail out.

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Fixes capture arg containing even declared parameters.
