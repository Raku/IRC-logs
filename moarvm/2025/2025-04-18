[09:30] <lizmat> still thinking about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5826   

[09:31] <lizmat> and I wonder: at the MoarVM level, there is no difference between a "sub" and a "multi sub" code block, right?

[09:32] <lizmat> aka, the issue context capture issue cannot be in the VM?

[09:37] <nine> right

[10:47] <nine> lizmat: I think #5826 just cannot work as intended. If we look at what multi dispatch does conceptually. We call a proto. That proto goes through its list of candidates, picks the most appropriate one and calls this. The list of candidates is a property of the proto itself.

[10:48] <nine> That candidates list will contain the multi candidates as they are declared originally. They are not closure clones!

[10:49] <nine> To fix it you'd have to also create clone of that candidates list and have each element itself be a clone with the closure propagated.

[10:58] <lizmat> ok, then I'll propose a workaround

[21:21] <[Coke]> I still need write access to moarvm.org's repo. jnthn1, any chance you can sort for me so the release is smooth tomorrow?

[21:21] <[Coke]> worst case, jdv, will need you to approve a PR for me again tomorrow.
