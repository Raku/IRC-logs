[18:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1889: Add an Ubuntu ARM64 runner to CI

[18:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1889

[19:00] <lizmat> timo: re  what was that, 5 hours of running it on repeat, no repro

[19:01] <lizmat> I get the impression sometimes that to trigger these problems, you need some random other process doing stuff as well

[19:01] <lizmat> to change timings

[19:10] <timo> i'm running a test_jobs=8 make test now, would you expect that to help?

[19:11] <timo> 8 cores on this machine

[19:12] <lizmat> yeah, something like that :-)

[19:53] <timo> hm, where did MasterDuke find support for arm on azure pipelines? i can't seem to find anything on a quick google search

[19:54] <timo> there is something else called ARM but it's some acronym starting with "azure" so that's not what this is

[20:01] <coleman> Can you select some azure "instance type"? Running on arm might mean setting some arm type as a param. Probably with a long and funky identifier.

[20:34] <ugexe> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2020/sprint-171-update

[20:35] <ugexe> "Azure Pipelines introduces support for Linux/ARM64"

[20:36] <timo> > You can now run your self-hosted agents on Linux/ARM64. We added Linux/ARM64 to the list of supported platforms for the Azure Pipelines agent.

[20:37] <timo> so that will only help us if we host our own arm64 machine to run the azure pipelines program on it

[23:14] <MasterDuke> bumping libuv to 1.50.0 fails to build

[23:14] <MasterDuke> on both arm and x86

[23:15] <MasterDuke> 3rdparty/libuv/src/unix/udp.c: In function ‘uv__udp_sendmsg’:

[23:15] <MasterDuke> 3rdparty/libuv/src/unix/udp.c:1351:10: error: ISO C90 forbids array ‘addrs’ whose size cannot be evaluated [-Werror=vla]

[23:15] <MasterDuke>  1351 |   struct sockaddr* addrs[N];

[23:18] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/e694f8ff441089fb1b872c9fcc91404f94443c7f

[23:20] <[Coke]> OOH IT ME

[23:23] <ugexe> wasn't udp sendmsg related recently added to moarvm?

[23:26] <ugexe> actually i think i'm thinking of libuv itself

[23:26] <MasterDuke> it looks like the code was recently modified

[23:28] <MasterDuke> we unconditionally disable VLAs because they don't compile under windows, but that's the unix code in libuv, so it does build if i remove `-Werror=vla`

[23:29] <MasterDuke> there's probably some way to enable them for just that file

[23:31] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/ChangeLog looks like there might be a couple things timo might be interested in for 1.50
