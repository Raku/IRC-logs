[00:50] <timo> i'm a bit confused by the statement that only a c compiler knows how to call a variadic function. is that a confusion with methods in C++ and name mangling and such? which we do have support for.

[01:05] <timo> and as long as you have the right function to mprotect a memory area as executable, you can already just turn a CArray of bytes into a pointer that you can invoke if you like

[01:06] <timo> but if you use a C compiler to generate those bytes, you also need to interface with the linker or something else that will correct your addresses for you to account for address space layout randomization, or just the fact that dynamic libraries may be loaded in a different order and have their symbols at different addresses just for that reason
