[18:37] <MasterDuke> what synthetics can a latin1 string have?

[18:37] <tellable6> 2025-10-11T16:41:46Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> masterduke - if you're serious about getting that into 2025.10, please make sure we get version bumps up to rakudo. Ping me when it's done so I can restart blin. Hopefully no issues on other platforms.

[18:37] <tellable6> 2025-10-11T16:49:08Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> masterduke oops, nevermind!

[19:09] <[Coke]> my previous comment about synthetics - I didn't realize he was using a grammar, so that might not be relevant.

[19:09] <[Coke]> unless this is unrelated, in which case: \r\n, maybe?

[19:10] <[Coke]> (is that actually synthetic?)

[19:10] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: unrelated. i'm just confused by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/strings/latin1.c#L36

[19:11] <MasterDuke> but yeah, i believe we normalize it into a synthetic
