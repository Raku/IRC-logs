[11:23] <lizmat> hmmm.. we just had another newbie running into:

[11:23] <lizmat> m: sub { await start { return } }()

[11:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e8d7f656: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Did not find expected unwind target frame.␤»

[11:23] <lizmat> first reported 6+ years ago

[11:23] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2753

[11:24] <lizmat> isn't there really a way to make this into a trappable Rakudo error so that we can give more specific feedback ?

[11:24] <lizmat> because the error atm feels like a segfault type thingy

[12:10] <timo> just™ put a handler for return control exceptions in the same spot where we already catch other exceptions that happens inside of start blocks?

[12:10] *** mef joined
[12:12] <timo> at least to make a better error message

[12:12] <timo> we can maybe also find this problem in the compiler somewhere if we can prove there's no way for "return" to work there

[13:17] <lizmat> there's not always a visible "start" involved:
