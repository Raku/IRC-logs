[03:52] <JimmyZ> nine: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1712 is it useful?

[03:54] <JimmyZ> looks like it is replaced by https://github.com/Rakudo/Rakudo/commit/874becf2586825b2cc48e8b83ca7dc74d5012933

[06:35] <nine> JimmyZ: it's currently not used. However I can only say it definitively once I'm through with RakuAST and know that the alternative really covers all places.

[06:35] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to JimmyZ

[07:56] <timo> OK, I think the problem with the misaligned access is that we're inappropriately casting to MVMP6intBody. when we create a P6Opaque, we're not doing the equivalent of what a C compiler would do when embedding an actual MVMP6intBody, we "just" have the int of the size that we want in there, and the MVMP6intBody has a union of all the different int types, so the alignment constraints for the struct

[07:56] <timo> are the greatest of the alternatives

[11:16] <nine> Hey party people! I know making stuff faster is super fun and all. Could we maybe however shift the focus on stability for a bit? We're rapidly approaching the bad old times when we had to run spectests several times to see wheter those failures are due to our own change or just random crashes :/

[11:16] <nine> s/on stability/to stability/

[11:31] <timo> you call me "party people" yet you have never offered me a silly party hat ;_;

[11:34] <timo> MasterDuke's ubsan investigation has been for improving reliability I'd claim

[11:35] <timo> if you like, you can point me at an issue or two, or some CI runs with what looks like random crashes, maybe I can figure some of that out?

[11:38] <timo> ... if i can somehow repro it locally, that is :|

[14:05] <jdv> flappers are up?

[14:06] <jdv> does there seem to be any particular ways to excite them more?

[14:07] <lizmat> Needing to precomp stuff, is one way

[14:57] <timo> so can we try to torture-test that by running only the spec tests that use something that needs to be precompiled and run it over and over while deleting the precomp after every full run? or every other full run maybe

[16:16] <lizmat> yes, that would be one approach I'd sya

[16:16] <lizmat> *say

[16:17] <Nicholas> I have a sun hat today. I'm not sure if that counts as a party hat

[16:18] <Nicholas> and I'm about to back out into the sun. Today is strange. -4 overnight, +20 now

[16:25] <lizmat> yeah..  I think I just go my first sun burn of the year  :-)

[16:28] <[Coke]> it's warmed up about 30deg F here in the past few days.

[16:28] <[Coke]> been hovering at -8C for weeks

[16:30] <jdv> its 47f/9c in the nyc.  nice out.

[16:30] <jdv> well, 8c

[16:31] <jdv> Nicholas: ghr was you, right?

[17:03] <Nicholas> ght?

[17:42] <jdv> great hash refactor

[18:36] <Nicholas> oh yes. "I deny everything"

[18:45] <lizmat> "I have no active memories of that"  :-)

[19:01] <jdv> ha:)

[19:02] <jdv> very good!

[19:03] <lizmat> it's one of the most well known lines from our former PM Mark Rutte, now head of NATO
