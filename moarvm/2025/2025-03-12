[06:39] <nine> Again "a semantic stream of bytes" not uint32s. And again, problems because we have two data types for the same purpose. As for writing arbitrary data types to a byte array, in Scala you'd wrap an Array[Byte] in a ByteArrayOutputStream and then use its writeObject method.

[06:40] <nine> Crucial difference is that the mechanism of turning things into bytes is separate from the actual data storage. This way you can just re-use the existing Array type for the actual storage.

[18:24] <lizmat> do we have any indication  whether MoarVM builds on Plan9 ?

[18:35] <timo> does libuv have a plan9 port?

[18:39] <lizmat> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.md   doesn't look like it, so that's out then :-)

[19:55] <timo> doesn't have to be a full port, but it would still be a lot of work

[19:56] <timo> if you postpone some features and just concentrate on what gets you to a "hello world" in nqp, it would maybe not be terrifyingly much

[20:00] <ugexe> i imagine it would require redoing our entire build system since i doubt there is a fully compatible perl for it

[21:32] <nine> Well the perlplan9 man page is not encouraging :D https://perldoc.perl.org/perlplan9

[21:34] <Nicholas> https://bendyworks.com/blog/getting-plan-9-running-on-the-raspberry-pi/ -- Installing Plan 9 on the raspberry pi couldnâ€™t be much easier.

[21:34] <Nicholas> oh wait. 2012

[21:34] <Nicholas> plan9 isn't helping anyone here

[21:37] <Nicholas> (to clarify slightly. I briefly looked into "how do I install Plan9 so that I can figure out the perl port" and decided that if the most recent SD card images were for a Pi1, it probably wasn't going to be worth it)
