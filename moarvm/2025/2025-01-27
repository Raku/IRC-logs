[10:02] <patrickb> Did the pre release revert get reapplied again?

[10:02] <tellable6> 2025-01-26T01:40:03Z #raku <[Coke]> patrickb 2025.01 releases are on github

[10:17] *** sena_kun left
[10:19] <lizmat> yes

[10:19] <lizmat> I cherry-picked the original commit

[10:27] <patrickb> üëçüèº

[14:08] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/01/27/2025-04-the-first/

[16:17] <lizmat> looks like El_Che has problems building the 2025.01 release:

[16:20] <lizmat> anything wrong with this?  https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/master/actions/download.sh#L11

[16:23] <lizmat> patrickb [Coke] ^^

[16:30] <ugexe> 3rdparty/libuv/src/unix/udp.c:1351:10: error: ISO C90 forbids array 'addrs' whose size cannot be evaluated [-Werror=vla]

[16:30] <ugexe> vla was disabled in a recentish commit

[16:33] <lizmat> ugexe: yeah, but that was post 2025.01

[16:45] <[Coke]> there was some wonkiness with the moarvm tarballs

[16:45] <[Coke]> but everyone who tested was able to extract them.

[16:45] <[Coke]> .. it's dying on the git clone??

[16:47] <[Coke]> ah, no it is dying on that - so the issue maybe that we bumped the 3rdparty code but didn't apply the error relaxing

[16:47] <[Coke]> ?

[16:47] <ugexe> those are in the same PR/commit

[16:47] <ugexe> "Turn off vla errors and bump libuv"

[16:47] <lizmat> and both were *post* 2025.01

[16:48] <[Coke]> ... so not sure where the errors in the nxadm link above are coming from then.

[16:48] <[Coke]> let me back up - what's the error with the 2025.01 build?

[16:49] <lizmat> git checkout 2025.01

[16:49] <lizmat> warning: unable to rmdir '3rdparty/rapidhash': Directory not empty

[16:49] <lizmat> Note: switching to '2025.01'.

[16:49] <lizmat> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/actions/runs/12993150546/job/36234685026#step:3:75

[16:49] <[Coke]> do then need a fresh checkout because of submodule cruft in main?

[16:49] <[Coke]> s/checkout/clone

[16:50] <ugexe> the error is libuv + vla

[16:51] <[Coke]> that's a warning and there's no failure in that page, though?

[16:51] <ugexe> the libuv update shouldn't be in the release, but even if it is then vla should be disabled in the same update

[16:51] <ugexe> which i dont understand

[16:51] <ugexe> the warning probably isnt a big deal since the actual error is not referencing it

[16:52] <lizmat> well, El_Che is currently not well, so I guess we'll wait until they can give more feedback

[16:52] <ugexe> hmm

[16:52] <[Coke]> on the page with the error, I see 'tar xzf moarvm.tar.gz ' - where is that tgz coming from, is that the problem?

[16:52] <ugexe> the rapidhash thing was added after the release as well i think, and that warning references that

[16:53] <[Coke]> Yup, confusing. Hopefully worst case we can do a .1 tarball if needed.

[16:53] <[Coke]> but it really reads like he's building HEAD?

[16:54] <lizmat> but even building HEAD should be ok ?

[16:54] <lizmat> maybe this is just a long standing issue

[16:54] <lizmat> before, there had not been any commits to MoarVM to build these packages maybe ?

[16:54] <lizmat> so the fact that HEAD was being built, wasn't notice

[16:54] <lizmat> d

[16:55] <[Coke]> oh, that would be... bad

[16:55] <lizmat> yet, otoh, HEAD should also just build

[16:55] <[Coke]> well, let's hope he feels better and we can get to the bottom of it.

[16:57] <ugexe> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/actions/runs/12993150546/job/36234685026#step:3:94

[16:57] <ugexe> it is showing libuv/ has modifications

[16:59] <ugexe> they should probably add a check to make sure their checkout is clean or whatever

[17:02] <[Coke]> +1
