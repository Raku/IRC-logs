[16:34] <japhb> timo: ITYM "geometrically" or "exponentially"

[22:42] <timo> i wasn't sure which one it was, so i decided to go the "post the wrong answer on the internet" route to find out what would be right :D

[22:43] <japhb> In that case, I think you were perfectly successful.  :-)

[22:47] <timo> thank you for your compliance

[22:48] <japhb> I aim to please
