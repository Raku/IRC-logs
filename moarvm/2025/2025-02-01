[23:57] <timo> could it be that for some "wild" cases we get past the 512 or 32 that are constant in the new code?

[23:58] <timo> one of the test cases that fails was checking core settings for the keys in it

[23:58] <timo> depending on how that's implemented, i can imagine it could have one entry for every different type in the setting? or something like that?

[23:59] <timo> in any case, that's a test that segfaults, t/02-rakudo/04-settingkeys-6e.t

[23:59] <timo> if you try it locally, MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 may be helpful (or maybe a hindrance) to repro
