[01:31] <MasterDuke> when would https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/strings/utf8.c#L200 ever be true?

[01:32] <MasterDuke> i sort of thought that normalization could only ever result in fewer graphemes than bytes?

[01:32] <MasterDuke> fwiw, it's never true during a build of rakudo

[01:46] <MasterDuke> in the streaming decoder i see it could be adding in stuff stored in the MVMDecodeStream's normalizer. but wouldn't the thing about the result not being bigger than the bytes it's working on + the bytes in the normalizer still be true?

[01:47] <MasterDuke> so couldn't https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/strings/utf8.c#L389 be `bufsize + bytes-in-normalizer` and then it wouldn't have to check for reallocing?

[01:48] <MasterDuke> the conditional on line 200 never hits during a `make m-test` or `make m-spectest` either

[09:15] <lizmat> perhaps that line is from before NFG was implemented ?

[09:16] <lizmat> and as such decomposing would run the risk of needing a larger buffer ?
