[10:42] <lizmat> hmmm.. I wonder how hard it would be to get sha256, sha384 and sha512 natively into MoarVM

[10:42] <lizmat> just realizing that the sha1 implementation is from a library that jnthn last touched in 2011

[19:12] <japhb> Recent implementations of the various crypto primitives would be a very good thing.  Likely to be much faster on recent hardware, at the very least.

[22:20] <Voldenet> I use Crypt::LibGcrypt bindings for sha256 and sha3, it works fine

[22:28] <Voldenet> libsodium has nice api, but I don't use it in raku

[22:30] <Voldenet> It bet it'd be fine to use existing libraries for built-in cryptography

[22:54] <lizmat> I recently found out that OpenSSL::Digest offers all of them: sha1 .. sha512

[22:54] <lizmat> which makes me wonder whether it would be an idea to include all of OpenSSL into MoarVM
