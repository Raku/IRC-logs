[16:49] <[Coke]> librasteve_: The version of parrot is probably important there.

[16:50] <[Coke]> it was just some random version

[18:29] <librasteve_> did parrot morph into moarvm - or did it just die?

[18:30] <lizmat> the only thing left over from the Parrot days, is roasr

[18:30] <lizmat> *roast

[18:31] <jdv> parrot was a differnt time

[18:33] <jdv> ask chromatic or dan or allison.

[18:33] <jdv> it was the first attempt at a runtime for "p6"

[18:34] <jdv> moarvm is jnthn's attempt to "do that".  ask jnthn about that.

[18:35] <jdv> i attended a talk by dan at mit in boston on parrot a very long time ago.  it was fun.

[18:35] <lizmat> librasteve_: probably not ask chromatic: there's a lot of anger and disappointment there

[18:36] <jdv> there's that too:(

[18:36] <jdv> it's "complicated"
