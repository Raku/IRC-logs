[16:34] <lizmat> question on #raku-beginner: What is the last version of Rakudo/Rakudo Star that still works on Windows 8.1

[16:34] <lizmat> I haz *no* idea, but maybe someone here does?   timo patrickb nine ?

[16:45] <[Coke]> Oof. I'm not even sure where I could run that test.

[17:05] <nine> All I can say is that on the last version of Windows I used, that was 98 SE, I didn't run rakudo.

[17:22] <timo> i think i was on XP for a long while, i don't think i even tried vista

[17:22] <timo> was there something in between?

[17:48] * [Coke] is reminded to try rakudo latest on his windows box

[17:48] <[Coke]> do we have a test for long-file-name behavior?

[17:50] <[Coke]> patrickb?

[18:05] <patrickb> I believe we don't. Installing a few modules has for me been a good enough test to reliably get it to fail.

[18:10] <[Coke]> do you know if our fix requires the user to set the windows registry key to upport long names?

[18:10] <[Coke]> (I am guessing that's more for, e.g. cmd support)

[18:20] <patrickb> Not entirely sure, but pretty confident that the win long path name reg key is not necessary. That's a different mechanism.
