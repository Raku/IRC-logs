[12:47] <mandrillone> The machine language interface for ibm basic was very clever: you would start basic using the debug.com software, then you would be presented with a mini assembler where you could type in your machine language routine and test in with just in time compilation.

[12:48] <mandrillone> once done, you would run basic and save your routine with the bsave directive

[12:48] <mandrillone> to use it, you had the bload directive providing dynamic linking and call directive for invocation
