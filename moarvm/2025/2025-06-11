[02:43] <jdv> do we not use PRs or at least work locally and curate so as not to spam tiny low signal commits like that?

[02:45] <jdv> japhb: ^

[03:44] <japhb> jdv: A few of those are small, as I was separating out unrelated bits fixed in passing from the larger changes.  Most of the commits are the larger ones; this damn thing just requires a LOT of cleanup.

[03:45] <japhb> I *could* work in a branch, but it would most likely bitrot, and the whole point is that I'm unbitrotting the Unicode processing scripts that are several years old now.

[03:45] <japhb> ... and pushing to a branch would do just as much to spam the channel.

[03:46] <japhb> Basically wherever I stop when I get pulled away is in a better state to pick up than it was before.

[03:47] <japhb> (I'm not creating any new features, just cleanup and minor bug fixing.)

[03:50] <japhb> Still, I suppose I can collect together a few at a time so as to convince Geth to go into summary mode.  :-)

[03:50] * japhb wonders what the summary threshold is

[03:51] <japhb> Hmmm, larger than 3 it appears.

[10:17] <lizmat> yeah, I think it's 5
