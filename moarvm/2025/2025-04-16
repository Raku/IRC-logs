[13:29] <lizmat> hope someone will be able something with that here

[14:24] <Woodi> frame dispatch used a lot - heavy functions calls ? maybe functions are too small and too specialized ? :)

[14:28] <lizmat> isn't that what gets called on *any* dispatch ?

[14:31] <timo> MVM_frame_dispatch is for dispatching execution to a frame with some arguments

[14:31] <lizmat> as opposed to?

[14:31] <lizmat> I mean, that would cover any method call, no ?

[14:34] <timo> as opposed to other uses of nqp::dispatch i think?

[14:40] <lizmat> I'm not sure ?

[14:51] <timo> so it turns out there actually is a way to ask libuv to callback when a numbered fd is ready for reading and/or writing and/or has an error of some kind

[14:55] <nine> As I said before I'm very skeptical that such low level profiles will be very helpful at this point. I recommend looking for places in the code where we calculate the same information multiple times where a simple cache would safe us a lot of work.

[14:56] <nine> Or even before that: I have noticed that in some cases we can end up referencing the same child nodes on multiple paths (in visit-children). That means everything we do including begin and check processing is done multiple times as well.

[15:02] <japhb> I guess an interesting report would be all caller/callee pairs where the callee count is 2x or more the caller count.  Even a simple filtering that doesn't account for the callee possibly being called by many different callers would still give a useful view I'd think.
