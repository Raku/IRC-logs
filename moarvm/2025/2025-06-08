[15:41] <leont> I was looking at making improving the atomics, and frankly getting rid of libatomic_ops would make everything easier.

[15:41] <[Coke]> :)

[15:41] <leont> C11 is lightyears ahead, and since 2022 MSVC also supports them so I think that'd be fine

[15:42] <leont> *C11 atomics

[20:26] <japhb> What makes the C11 atomics so much better than libatomic_ops?

[20:59] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Leont++ created pull request #1943: Remove libatomic_ops

[21:19] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1944

[21:20] <leont> It would be helpful to merge the second one before the 10th, because of the brown-outs

[21:22] <japhb> leont: Will do as soon as we get CI on it.

[21:22] <japhb> My question above still stands.  :-)

[21:23] <japhb> (Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using standards when available.  You just made it sound like it would be a massive improvement, and not just in reducing stuff we have to support.)

[21:25] <leont> Several things really.

[21:25] <japhb> (I guess I should say "standards *that don't suck*", because of course some of them do.  We're going to assume the C11 committee did better than that.  ;-) )

[21:27] <leont> Firstly, it supports explicit memory ordering, which means we can choose the most performant option that is appropriate for the specific case.

[21:27] <leont> One of the other nice things is that C11 atomics are type generic. So we don't need to cast from and to AO_t* all the time. This makes it much easier to use it with pointers in particular.

[21:28] <leont> Secondly, it supports more options. It seems libatomics lacks a plain exchange (or maybe I fail to find it), which is sometimes needed.

[21:30] <japhb> Fair enough.  Thanks for the summary!

[21:44] <leont> That is also failing on main

[21:45] <japhb> OK, so it looks like some CI cleanup is needed.  But I'll merge #1944 now.

[21:46] <leont> Yeah I was looking at the Ubuntu issue, but I have no idea what to do about Mac

[21:46] <japhb> Wait ... how do the clang/gcc _no_c11_atomics builds pass now that there is now libAO?

[21:48] *** MasterDuke left
[21:50] <japhb> Oh duh, because 1943 hasn't been merged.  I'm apparently an idiot.
