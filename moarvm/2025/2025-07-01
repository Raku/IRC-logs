[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Implement return prioritization

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Calling &return triggers a stack unwind which can cause code (e.g. in

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: `LEAVE` phasers) to run. That code can also call `&return`. The returns

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: conflict, if the later return unwinds over the return continuation

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: marker of the former return in the call stack, i.e. the `LEAVE` frame.

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: In such situations one wants the return to win that unwinds more of the

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: stack. This is the behavior implemented by this change. Previously the

[08:27] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: later return always won.

[08:28] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[08:28] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: This implements the behavior discussed in Raku/problem-solving#417.
