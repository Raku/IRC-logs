[00:37] <MasterDuke> timo: haven't there been a bunch of "invalid thread ID in work pass" issues? think your recent fix might have closed more than just grondilu's problem?

[05:53] <timo> oh, that's difficult to say, but it's possible. do we have some code that triggered the issue that we can re-run with the patch?

[12:28] <melezhik> Copy pasting from raku channel - "question from Alpine maintainer who is doing raku-* package for Sparrow - "are the precompilation files specific to a particular version of Rakudo? In other words, after a Rakudo upgrade, do i need to precompile every Raku module again?"	11:28	 My knowlege it is not, but I am not sure."

[13:44] <lizmat> melezhik: .precomp directories will be created automatically on first execution of a module

[13:44] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[13:44] <lizmat> melezhik: they should probably *not* be included in a distribution

[13:44] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[13:47] <nine> In case anyone reads lizmat's message: NO! That's terribly wrong.

[13:48] <nine> They are absolutely meant to be part of a binary distribution's packages.

[13:48] <lizmat> understood  :-)

[13:48] <lizmat> see discussion on #raku-dev

[20:23] <timo> that's good
