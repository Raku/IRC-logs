[18:22] <mandrillone> nine: if the objective is just making a trampoline to call a function pointer, there are not many things to fix

[18:23] <mandrillone> I’d use a c compiler just because it is portable and it knows the abi very well

[23:42] <timo> i think set_size_internal doesn't handle the "shift slots off the beginning first" case correctly at the moment
