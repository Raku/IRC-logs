[12:42] <lizmat> hmmm.. the git describe shows 2025.02-16-g14f4f2a93

[12:43] <lizmat> not anything 2025.03 releted

[12:45] <lizmat> did we miss a tag ?

[12:47] <lizmat> even a fresh clone says "2025.02-16-g14f4f2a93" ?

[12:49] <lizmat> VERSION appears to be correct

[12:50] <lizmat> tag appears to be done

[12:52] *** JimmyZhuo joined
[12:53] <JimmyZhuo> [Coke]: the 2025.03 tag is not pushed

[12:53] <tellable6> 2025-03-21T13:07:06Z #raku-dev <nine> JimmyZhuo: just a heads up. My desktop won't be available over the weekend

[12:54] <JimmyZhuo> and I can't build the rakudo without the new tag

[12:56] <lizmat> meh, can't force push either

[13:04] * lizmat gives up for now

[13:05] <patrickb> lizmat: Can you make Coke an admin on the Moar repo? (Or did that already happen?)

[13:06] <lizmat> I don't have rights to be able to do that :-(

[13:27] <jdv> afaik coke has moarvm repo but not the moarvm.org repo

[13:33] <patrickb> ah, moarvm/moarvm.org is missing in GitHub.com/orgs/moarvm/teams/team-moarvm/repositories

[13:47] <[Coke]> checking

[13:50] <[Coke]> moarvm tag is there now

[13:50] <[Coke]> Apologies.

[13:52] <[Coke]> other two repos seem fine

[13:52] <[Coke]> patrickb: good catch.

[13:53] <lizmat> git describe still shows the wrong thing, even on a fresh clone  :-(

[14:08] <[Coke]> Thanks, nine.

[14:09] <[Coke]> Seems like I got the *release* correct but missed the tag and the merge? *sigh*

[14:19] <nine> Always those pesky details :)

[14:21] <[Coke]> thanks for the cleanup!

[14:22] <[Coke]> in future will also try to do the release more in EU time. :)

[15:17] <jdv> ive always tried to dp it earlier to overlap eu

[15:42] <jdv> [Coke]: how did the tag not get pushed?  if the guide is followed seems impossible:)

[15:42] <[Coke]> Yup, I just got a really late start. Ended up booking weekend plans after agreeing to do the release. :)

[15:43] <[Coke]> Exactly, the guide wasn't followed on step 12 for moarvm.

[15:44] <[Coke]> MoarVM requires slightly more care than rakudo, since it's all manual, and I flubbed that part.

[15:44] <[Coke]> thankfully it didn't impact the release, just core devs next day.

[15:44] <jdv> :)
