[20:19] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1942 is interesting. we could just not use ubuntu 22.04 for the clang+dynasm jobs, but that doesn't seem good

[20:19] <MasterDuke> we could install a different clang

[20:24] <MasterDuke> we could switch to libffi by default, or just remove dynasm completely

[20:26] <MasterDuke> oops, not use *24.04*

[20:33] <MasterDuke> i'm sort of surprised nobody ran into this

[20:33] <japhb> Heh, I just commented something similar on the PR.

[20:34] <japhb> From my point of view if two different stable versions of clang are producing actual different results (not just an extra warning or some such), that would indicate we've got an undefined behavior bug somewhere in that code

[20:35] <MasterDuke> or ubuntu 24.04 shipped with a buggy default version of clang

[20:36] <MasterDuke> which isn't impossible, clang 18-20 or something like that severely regressed in computed goto performance

[20:37] <MasterDuke> which is a problem for us and python

[20:37] <japhb> Seems like it would have been patched by now, assuming those ubuntu images get package updates

[20:37] <japhb> Ouch (computed goto performance)

[20:38] <japhb> So you're saying the problem may not be a small bug, but a complete change in behavior for the stable series?  Ugh.

[20:40] <MasterDuke> well, i don't really know. just the one test failed...

[20:49] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: unrelated, but i guess the mimalloc bump will have to be reverted, i haven't heard yet from my question about when they're going to do a next release

[20:50] <MasterDuke> afk

[20:51] <japhb> It's just one test sure, but that test is computing a completely different result than expected; it's not a matter of a performance dip, an extra warning, or even a compile error.  It's just getting the wrong result, which is pretty much the worst of those behaviors.
