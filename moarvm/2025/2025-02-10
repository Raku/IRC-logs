[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 9a1af71f3d | MasterDuke17++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | src/strings/utf8.c

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Some simplifications to MVM_string_utf8_decode (#1910)

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: * Remove always-false checks

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: The size of the normalized results of decoding will always be

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: less-than-or-equal to the number of input bytes, so these checks aren't

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: needed.

[18:51] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: <…commit message has 8 more lines…>

[19:17] <lizmat> MasterDuke17: with this patch, 2 spectests fail for me

[19:17] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[19:17] <lizmat> t/spec/S32-str/encode.rakudo.moar                           (Wstat: 512 Tests: 41 Failed: 2)

[19:17] <lizmat>   Failed tests:  12-13

[19:18] <lizmat> the first one isn't too bad: it apparently loses some information in the error message

[19:19] <lizmat> the second one is more serious: "ssß".encode("latin1").decode("utf8") doesn't die anymore, but encodes to "ss"

[19:19] <lizmat> I've already bumped NQP, but will not bump Rakudo

[21:31] <scovit> hello

[21:31] <tellable6> 2020-10-15T21:39:20Z #raku-dev <patrickb> scovit: Thanks for your input! I think I'll keep the current solution for now. Then we can discuss how to best do it in the future. I don't think there is much of a backwards compatibility issue here.

[21:32] <scovit> dirops.c defienes PATH_MAX that is a security issue, would you accept a patch to get rid of it?

[21:33] <scovit> basically replacing MVM_dir_cwd with a unix and a windows safe versions

[21:33] <patrickb> scovit: I have no idea what my above comment was about... :-P

[21:33] <scovit> patrickb: me neither, long time I don't come here

[21:34] <patrickb> scovit: That sounds like a pretty straight forward patch and a no brainier to merge. Please go ahead!

[23:17] <scovit> Can someone review this patch? https://github.com/scovit/MoarVM/commit/37b0d6b8efa28462872845c526cd74d78801dc66

[23:17] <scovit> also, I couldn't test if it builds on windows

[23:19] <scovit> further, it could be that the linux code path works on win32, not sure how moarvm deals with unicode filenames

[23:19] <scovit> my guess is that those are the only difference
