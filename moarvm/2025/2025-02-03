[20:09] <timo> MasterDuke, do you know if that "check for numbers above 127" loop can be broken out of while still being vectorized? also, do you happen to have stats of what lengths of string happen how often?

[20:13] <timo> do you know what the target architecture is that your gcc is compiling for? i.e. if any particular -march= is active? can you try CFLAGS=-march=native and see if that makes a difference? that will target your exact processor with all its capabilities, rather than something that uses only stuff that can be assumed to be there ... not actually sure what the exact decisionmaking is based on?
