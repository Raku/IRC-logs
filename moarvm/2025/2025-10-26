[21:07] <MasterDuke> not quite sure what's up with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1967

[21:07] <tellable6> 2025-10-20T05:52:34Z #moarvm <patrickb> MasterDuke: That's impressive! I'm willing to help. Which are you less fond of? Windows or MacOS?

[21:10] <MasterDuke> moarvm builds on my laptop (asahi linux (aarch64)). libffi builds on my desktop (x86-64 linux) when i run the commands manually, but fails with `../src/tramp.c:365:41: error: pointer of type 'void *' used in arithmetic [-Werror=pointer-arith]` when i try to build moarvm

[21:10] <MasterDuke> and neither of those outcomes are what i see in the azure logs

[21:13] <MasterDuke> some of the azure errors seem to be because ffi.h isn't available yet. so i need moarvm to build the 3rdparty module before it tries to build itself

[21:22] <MasterDuke> ah. if i remove `-Werror=pointer-arith` from the moarvm CFLAGS then moarvm builds on the branch

[21:35] <MasterDuke> hm, now how to do that for just libffi...

[21:37] <MasterDuke> huh. changing `CFLAGS=\'$(CFLAGS)\'` to `CFLAGS=\'$(CFLAGS) -Wno-error=pointer-arith\'` in libffi's section of setup/build.pm doesn't actually modify the CFLAGS libffi gets...

[21:38] <MasterDuke> but afk for a while &
