[19:22] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:22] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: i think moarvm didn't get tagged

[19:23] <MasterDuke> or the tag didn't get merged to main?

[19:24] *** librasteve_ joined
[19:27] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: there's a tag and release both called 2025.10 that I can see on the front page.

[19:27] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tree/2025.10

[19:27] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases/tag/2025.10

[19:27] <[Coke]> ??

[19:28] <MasterDuke> if i look at a `git log`, i see `commit b4a45b00efdba3a630667a28f79a0069da1f49f8 (tag: list, tag: 2025.08, upstream/2025.080)`, but no commit with `tag: 2025:10`

[19:28] <linkable6> (2025-08-28) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b4a45b00ef Update changelog and version

[19:29] <[Coke]> Did you pull/fetch, etc?

[19:29] <MasterDuke> yep

[19:30] <[Coke]> we don't tag main, we tag the release branch

[19:30] <[Coke]> then we merge it back to main

[19:30] <[Coke]> try "git log 2025.10"

[19:31] <[Coke]> though I do see jdv's tag on main.

[19:31] <MasterDuke> yeah commit f56e50a7429e4857c2523e4e3b9b851d83befb4d is not in a `git log main`

[19:32] <[Coke]> confusingly, 53336b7f1 is

[19:32] <linkable6> (2025-10-18) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/53336b7f1c Update changelog and version (#1963)

[19:32] <MasterDuke> what was your git merge command?

[19:33] <[Coke]> "make a PR and use the UI"

[19:34] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tree/2025.10

[19:35] <[Coke]> is there any tooling that's going to break because of this?

[19:35] <MasterDuke> maybe it defaulted to a fast-forward? a random look through `git help merge` looks like `git merge --ff-only` might not bring the tag?

[19:35] <[Coke]> the tag is right, the release is ok..

[19:35] <[Coke]> again, I didn't use a command line

[19:37] <[Coke]> We could try to overwrite it by deleting the last two commits and manually merging that branch, and force pushing back.

[19:39] <MasterDuke> well, i just cloned moarvm and build it, and the version it reports is `This is MoarVM version 2025.08-8-gcaa62f6ce`

[19:39] <[Coke]> and your VERSION has 2025.10 in it?

[19:39] <MasterDuke> yep

[19:40] <MasterDuke> so trying to build nqp with this moarvm would fail. i'm sure it would work if i checked out the 2025.10 tag, but main should work also

[19:40] <timo2> i just fetched moar and got  * [new branch]          2025.10    -> origin/2025.10

[19:40] <[Coke]> ok. I can try the force push.

[19:40] <timo2>  * [new tag]             2025.10    -> 2025.10

[19:40] <timo2> | * f56e50a74 - (tag: 2025.10, origin/2025.10) Update changelog and version (3 hours ago) <Will Coleda>

[19:41] <timo2> the "update changelog and version (#1963)" commit that's on main isn't the identical one on the 2025.10 branch

[19:41] <[Coke]> timo2: yup. looks like somehow that commit ended up on main in a weird state with a different commit ID

[19:41] <timo2> the pull request may have been set to "squash"

[19:41] <[Coke]> it's the same diff, but not the same commit, right.

[19:41] <timo2> we can merge the 2025.10 branch into main now and everything should be fine

[19:41] <[Coke]> Yup, I could have done a squash, that's feasible.

[19:41] <timo2> no need to force push, we can avoid that

[19:42] <MasterDuke> github might have changed the default UI behavior, wouldn't surprise me

[19:42] <[Coke]> ok, checking...

[19:42] <timo2> aye

[19:42] <timo2> should we add a step to double-check that to the release docs?

[19:43] <[Coke]> Can't hurt. I only press that button once every few months!

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/338cff842d

[19:44] <[Coke]> Try that?

[19:45] <timo2> from just a git log it looks good

[19:45] <[Coke]> (the release was done from the same point as the tag, so none of that has to change)

[19:45] <[Coke]> \o/

[19:45] <MasterDuke> nqp is now building

[19:45] <timo2> i have a git alias "lg" that does 'log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %Cblue<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative'

[19:45] <MasterDuke> [Coke]++

[19:45] <timo2> i can recommend this, it's very nice

[19:45] <timo2> i often do `git lg --all`

[19:45] <timo2> maybe i'll make an alias `git lga` to do `git lg --all` too

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: A squash means the tag doesn't show up properly in the main commit history, so

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: git-describe still goes off the previous release.

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Thanks to the #moarvm team for noticing this immediately

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f432c6da83

[19:47] <[Coke]> I have a 'llog' alias that does nice formatting.

[19:47] <[Coke]>         llog  = log  --date=local --name-status --decorate=short --abbrev-commit --color

[19:47] <MasterDuke> timo2: my `glp` bash alias is the 99% the same as yours

[19:48] <MasterDuke> though 95% of the time i also add `-p`

[19:49] <timo2> the most important bit really is -g

[19:50] <timo2> sorry, not -g it's --graph

[19:52] <timo2> if you've never seen --graph, please give it a look

[19:53] <MasterDuke> yep, it's in my alias
