[23:23] <MasterDuke> timo: i have no idea how to read facts. but i'm looking at the 'after' of `MARKED` in a spesh log of CORE.c compilation

[23:23] <MasterDuke> BB 1 has `sp_getvt_o        r6(3),   r0(2), liti16(72), sslot(5)  # [001] getattr_o of '$!shared' in NQPMatch of a Perl6::Grammar`

[23:24] <MasterDuke> BB 12 has `getattr_o        r27(2),   r0(2),  r26(2), lits($!shared), liti16(-1)`

[23:27] <MasterDuke> but i wonder if the non-optimized came from the inline of `!cursor_start_fail`

[23:27] <MasterDuke> which has `getattr_o         r4(2),   r1(2),   r3(2), lits($!shared), liti16(-1)` in its BB 2

[23:29] <MasterDuke> istr we speculated a bunch of them were because spesh doesn't re-run after inlining?
