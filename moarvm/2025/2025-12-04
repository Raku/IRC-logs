[16:46] <lizmat> looks like Stage parse dropped about .5 second for me

[17:03] <[Coke]> nice.

[17:13] <timo> that's a surprise

[17:18] <ShimmerFairy> If I had to guess why the parse stage dropped (and it's a total guess), maybe calling the boundary-finding function once per grapheme, rather than once per string position, reduced some function call overhead.

[17:19] <timo> oh, does the time taken to decode the input file actually land in the timing for stage parse? i guess that makes sense

[17:27] <ShimmerFairy> I'd guess so, since the only thing beforehand is "stage start", which I'm guessing is just "the program's started".

[17:50] <timo> when i run `perf record -F10000 -g rakudo -e '"gen/moar/CORE.c.setting".IO.slurp.chars.say'` i get 8.92% time spent in MVM_string_utf8_decode and children, and a total 0.131048554 seconds time elapsed

[17:52] <timo> it would be quite a feat for stage parse to drop .5 seconds from just faster utf8 decoding if the performance on my machine is in any way representative of what liz's computer does? 

[17:54] <lizmat> hmmm...   well...  maybe I was too enthusiastic : next Stage parse was at 25.0  (before 24.2)   so I guess there's a bit of noise there

[17:54] <timo> yeah, that's always a concern
