[21:54] <MasterDuke> timo: is there an easy repro for what you mentioned in your recent commit?

[21:55] <MasterDuke> the freeze on debian+arm

[21:55] <timo> i got myself a guest access account on a debian porter box for that purpose

[21:55] <timo> i don't know of an easy way to get it

[21:55] <timo> reproduced

[21:55] <timo> i don't even know if it requires actual hardware or if qemu-system is enough

[21:56] <MasterDuke> ah. it's not the gh_1520 (sp) thing?

[22:04] <timo> oh, the spec test?

[22:05] <MasterDuke> oh, and any more thoughts/suggestions re the unoptimized getattr_*s?

[22:05] <MasterDuke> yeah

[22:05] <MasterDuke> the one that frequently fails in ci

[22:07] <timo> right, that is unrelated to the atomic access branch

[22:08] <MasterDuke> ah, ok

[22:08] <timo> on arm, while building rakudo, we sometimes go into an endless loop inside spesh_arg_guard_run

[22:10] <MasterDuke> huh. haven't experienced that yet on this hardware, but i've only built rakudo about 10-15 times so far

[23:14] <timo> yeah i had to run it maybe a hundred times for it to show up. you can repeatedly run core.c compilation to attempt it
