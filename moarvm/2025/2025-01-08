[00:26] <timo> if i want to properly look at spesh logs, i think i need to double the RAM in my machine

[12:47] <lizmat> fwiw, in the past days I've seen a few cases of:

[12:47] <lizmat> MoarVM panic: Internal error: zeroed target thread ID in work pass

[12:48] <lizmat> when something needed to be pre-compiled

[12:48] <lizmat> not reproducible so far :-(

[12:51] <lizmat> feels to me it's occurring more often than before, though

[12:51] <lizmat> but that's just a feeling, maybe I'm just precomping stuff more than before  :-)

[13:03] <timo> i've seen it in moarvm CI

[13:04] <timo> missing MVMROOT could be the issue there

[13:09] <timo> i should investigate if check-roots.py still works with coolroots

[13:29] <timo> gcc-python-plugin has apparently bit rotted, gotta use it with a years old gcc so that it compiles or something
