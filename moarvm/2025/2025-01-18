[22:12] <MasterDuke> anybody who knows make or setup.pm want to figure out how to disable the vla warning just when compiling libuv?

[22:20] <timo> my guess is we have to split up the list of targets so that libuv lives in a different list, then make separate CFLAGS variables one with and one without the vla error one

[22:25] <[Coke]> Looks like it's not a simple fix - there is only one copy of CFLAGS in the makefile

[22:25] <[Coke]> ... I was too slow. :)

[22:25] <[Coke]> Poking...

[22:29] <[Coke]> Yah, I think we'd have to split a bit to make that work.

[22:30] <[Coke]> If we have windows CI now, the original reason for adding that error flag is gone

[22:30] <[Coke]> the windows compilation will fail if it gets hit, we don't need the early warning from linux

[22:30] <[Coke]> Could also relax it to a warning

[22:31] <MasterDuke> oh, right

[22:31] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i'd rather get rid of it entirely than turn it into a warning. i'd just be a warning that's always ignored on linux

[22:32] <[Coke]> Sure
