[19:12] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: patrickbkr++ created pull request #1981: Fix building MoarVM with a system provided libuv

[19:12] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1981

[19:15] <lizmat> so, should be do a Rakudo point release?

[19:15] <lizmat> [Coke] ^

[19:30] <patrickb> both homebrew and Debian guys have shown willingness to just incorporate the patch manually. So we might get around a point release...

[19:35] <[Coke]> is it just a moar point release that's needed? that part is easy

[19:36] <[Coke]> doing an nqp and a rakudo one is... slightly more effort.

[19:39] <[Coke]> My preference is to have them apply the patch directly.

[19:41] <lizmat> I'c put a link to the patch in the issue
