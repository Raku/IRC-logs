[14:58] * timo drops a pin

[15:19] <timo> i'm wondering how much memory usage we're "wasting" because spesh never forgets

[15:32] <timo> in a program that only runs the compiler at the start for the main program, we still keep all the optimizations for all the routines in the compiler and the stuff in the grammar, as well as all the in-line caches and stuff

[15:32] <timo> but it's very possible that that's really just peanuts compared to everything else we definitely have to keep around

[16:23] <timo> this will make the sizes of static frames show up more correctly in heap snapshots, i think we weren't putting dispatch programs belonging to static frame inline cache slots (which is where they live) into the heap snapshots correctly
