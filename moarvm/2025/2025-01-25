[09:49] <patrickb> Can we get the Windows long path fix in?

[09:50] <lizmat> it couldn't get any worse on Windows, or could it ?

[09:50] <patrickb> did you look at the diff?

[09:51] <patrickb> It's a single char change with no possibility for regressions.

[09:51] <lizmat> hadn't looked yet, yeah, that looks ok

[09:52] <patrickb> In my naive world view at least. :-P

[09:55] <patrickb> That change hopefully finally fixes module installation on Windows.

[16:00] <jdv> [Coke]: there is no need, per se, for the delete/ignore in the moarvm changelog

[16:41] <timo> it's probably safe

[18:20] <[Coke]> jdv: yup, just in case. Figured the rakudo log was more important/required more fiddling in general.

[18:20] <[Coke]> I am not really happy about the DAY OF set of commits to main on MoarVM

[18:20] <[Coke]> Who is vouching for that?

[18:21] <[Coke]> I will plan on rolling that back before the release and someone can re-apply it after unless we get concensus

[18:24] <timo> yeah feel free to do that if it's not too much hassle

[18:58] <[Coke]> This was a PR from 2021 that just happened to get a commit 15 hours ago.

[18:59] <[Coke]> .seen niner

[18:59] <tellable6> [Coke], I haven't seen niner around, did you mean nine?

[18:59] <[Coke]> .seen nine

[18:59] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw nine 2024-11-27T13:36:16Z in #raku-dev: <nine> I would just get used to that :D

[19:00] <[Coke]> we also have the stray commit 7f9662c09291fc3b1b46d6c609694af755944be5

[19:00] <linkable6> (2025-01-25) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7f9662c092 Fix corner case of Windows long path handling

[19:01] <[Coke]> This looks like a safer commit, it's changing a > to a >= in a win specific set of code for paths that are already dealing with max-path issues.

[19:02] <[Coke]> If you had asked me, I would have said "don't commit anything to main". :| Anyone else have thoughts on this one?

[19:09] <patrickb> Sorry to have caused you a hassle. Didn't intend to...

[19:10] <[Coke]> Yours seems much safer than the other one; but any changes this close to release are a risk

[19:10] <[Coke]> Did you get a CI run with it?

[19:12] <patrickb> Incidentally that change fixes the install issues you reported a few days back. But yes, merges right before a release - meh.

[19:13] <patrickb> CI was green.

[19:25] <[Coke]> ok. We'll roll the dice on that one. :)

[23:23] <jdv> ditto

[23:24] <timo> can i see your log output or something?

[23:27] <timo> oh i guess it was the github runner that created these?

[23:28] <[Coke]> the other tar files? I think so

[23:28] <timo> hm those are tar not zip and the artifacts that github actions is creating are all zip files

[23:29] <timo> oh

[23:36] <[Coke]> even with the hiccups, This is so much less stressful than I remember Christmas being. :)

[23:45] <timo> seeing loads of projects that experienced the implausibly old timestamps at some point

[23:45] <[Coke]> ok, good
