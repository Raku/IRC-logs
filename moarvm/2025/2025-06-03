[06:56] <nine> Won't replace spesh, but may be a candidate for JIT

[08:59] <lizmat> does Apple Silicon fall under AArch64 ?

[09:00] <lizmat> AI says so

[09:01] <xiaomiao> most of the new stuff, yes

[09:01] <lizmat> nice...  I mean, rakudo is already faster on apple silicon than Intel, now imagine that with a JIT  :-)

[09:02] <lizmat> .oO( Some people, when confronted with a performance problem, think "I know, I'll use a JIT." Now they have two problems. :-)

[09:05] <xiaomiao> if only apple made useful hardware ;) (I have not enjoyed interacting with their notebooks, and the tech demo OS that comes preinstalled is also ... sigh)

[09:08] <lizmat> so what type of hardware do you use xiaomiao ?

[09:08] <xiaomiao> I'm kinda stuck on old ThinkPads

[09:09] <xiaomiao> no one wants to produce business-class notebooks anymore

[09:09] <lizmat> fwiw, my current MBP feels pretty business class to me, though  :-)

[09:10] <xiaomiao> I've had a few from $work

[09:10] <xiaomiao> between the sad battery range and the lack of sanity I've never managed to do more than tolerate them

[09:11] <xiaomiao> (Lenovo X270 has 95Wh battery, it's a bit of a cheat code :) )

[09:13] <lizmat> I'm more interested in the "N hours without power in normal usage" metric  :-)

[09:15] <xiaomiao> I get 16h+ 

[09:15] <lizmat> nice!

[09:15] <xiaomiao> M2 macbook was closer to 6 in my experience, luckily I got rid of that thing

[09:16] <xiaomiao> it's horrible as a laptop because it uses your legs as heatsink, so you will carry a book as insulation ... sigh

[09:18] <lizmat> ah, interesting...  my M4max remains pretty cool in normal usage...   I haven't had it put on its fans yet

[09:22] <xiaomiao> yes that's the problem ;) it's using the whole body as heatsink

[09:22] <xiaomiao> also fun because it's a wlan filter, so wlan range of macbooks is objectively atrocious

[09:23] <xiaomiao> but it's a nice room decoration 

[09:23] <lizmat> it is  :-)
