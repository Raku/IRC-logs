[05:32] <ShimmerFairy> Thankfully, the bug was a simple fix (I just ran out of time to keep working yesterday), all the tests run with no new failures, and not taking any longer than before. I want to at least touch up the NFG_QC property generation before sharing the MoarVM changes, and then I have to do stuff like figuring out how to decipher some of the roast test update process, and updating bits of Rakudo (and maybe NQP?)

[06:14] <patrickb> Nice!

[06:41] <ShimmerFairy> It seems that the big hurdles for the tests will be some new normalization behavior that causes GraphemeBreakTest.t to fail (not surprising, there's a note about Unicode 16 showing new behavior there), and a bunch of collation failures that might need me to learn the collation algorithm.

[16:35] <ShimmerFairy> Tomorrow I plan on sharing the MoarVM changes I made, even though I'm unsure on the NFG_QC property (pass all the grapheme break tests though), as well as pushing updated roast tests and hopefully tidying up nqp and rakudo. My only concern is that the collation test generator spits out thousands of "unexpected failures", so I don't know if I can/should push those test updates yet.
