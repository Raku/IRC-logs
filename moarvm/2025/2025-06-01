[00:19] <japhb> I'm in that fun category of folks that knows enough about Unicode to realize just how much they don't know, but at least I seem to be doing OK so far reading various documents.  But holy heck is there a lot to read!

[00:20] <timo> the really tricky bits we have to look out for is changes in the algorithms, like when "prepend" codepoints were introduced or something like that?

[00:22] <japhb> Apparently there are some changes to line breaks, and there are a number of smaller things too.

[00:23] <japhb> We're two versions behind (15.1 and 16.0), and the next version is coming in 3 months, so there are a number of changes to chew through.

[00:24] <japhb> I'm also wondering if our previous updates actually included all the changes we should have done, or just updated tables.

[00:25] <japhb> So at least 15.0 is suspect (in the sense that the commit didn't touch many files, *not* that I have determined it was incorrect -- I just need to research it)

[20:29] *** japhb left
[20:51] *** japhb joined
[23:45] * japhb looks at nearly 3000 lines of 3-year-untouched partially-bitrotted Unicode table conversion scripts and cries a little on the inside

[23:51] <japhb> More like 5 years I guess; most of the changes since are trivial
