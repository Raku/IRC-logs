[11:40] <MasterDuke> jnthn: thanks for the reply. if it could make sense to split up decoding and normalization, do you have any ideas/suggestions for how to quickly do just the normalization?

[19:44] <japhb> Well that's older than I expected: ebefe2618 - Update to Unicode 15.0 (2 years, 5 months ago) <thundergnat>

[19:46] <lizmat> yeah... I guess we could ping thundergnat to see if they have any ideas

[19:50] <japhb> Unicode scripts with cool names: Crypto-Minoan

[20:13] <[Coke]> any ideas... on how to upgrade to Unicode 16?

[20:23] <japhb> I'm reading through various updates from 15.1 and 16.0 now.  There's a lot to go through, I'll let y'all know what I find.

[22:08] <japhb> Do we have documentation for any of MoarVM, Rakudo, or Raku (as a language) about Unicode choices we intentionally made (for instance, when multiple behavior "profiles" are all specced for the same situation, and applications are expected to pick one)?

[23:18] <MasterDuke> timo: https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2025/5/28/exploring-a-language-runtime-with-bpftrace seems like something you'd be interested in

[23:24] <MasterDuke> i have a local branch where i tried running tools/ucd2c.pl to upgrade to unicode 16. it went relatively smoothly, but then there were some failed tests that it ran that said i needed to look somewhere (i don't remember where) to figure out what to do. i got kind of blocked at that point since i don't really know unicode and wasn't sure what to do

[23:24] <MasterDuke> but it might be an even more straightforward procedure for someone else
