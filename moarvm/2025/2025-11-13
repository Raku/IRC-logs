[09:47] <ab5tract> Voldenet: yeah that looks like it, that ticket also links to https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/22847

[09:47] <ab5tract> Interestingly I did not encounter this at all when doing the original work on my Mac

[09:49] <ab5tract> I was trying to figure out how to disable the cache just to see if that helped at all but didn’t find how during a precursory glance through the mountain of clang / zig cc CLI flags and switches

[09:55] <ab5tract> Anyway, I guess *technically* this isn’t a blocker on the moarvm patch (thought it can wait until after release)
