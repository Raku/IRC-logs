[21:07] <japhb> Back to Cairo, eh?  Been a while since I've seen someone playing with that.  :-)

[21:29] <timo> leont was mentioning martimm's gobject-centric gtk bindings and i just wanted to give them a very quick spin

[21:30] <timo> i think there's no GtkSourceView binding in that bunch of modules, so if i were to port the "cairo live coding environment" over it would have to be the boring text input widget

[21:36] <japhb> What all do we have for gtk bindings at this point?  There's Xliff's full stack bindings, martimm's bindings, and then there was the ancient Gtk::Simple from ... jnthn I think?

[21:55] <timo> jnthn started it, I have a few changes in it but finanalyst and ab5tract have more changes in it than i do i think
