[21:44] <patrickb> I currently observe a callsite in MoarVM (a `sub` native call routine) that has an arg_count of 6 even though my sub only has 5 args. Is that somehow expected (i.e. there is some hidden last arg or some such?)

[21:47] <patrickb> One more data point: The respective sub has a slurpy.

[22:06] <lizmat> if it were a method, it could be the hidden *%_  ?

[22:07] <patrickb> That I have already accounted for. 

[22:07] <lizmat> so it is a method ?   then the invocant maybe?

[22:08] <patrickb> I suspect I messed up somewhere. I'm just unsure where. I didn't touch the parser at all.

[22:08] <patrickb> No it's a sub.

[22:09] <patrickb> I think I have to do some bisecting with my changes. Thanks so far!

[22:09] <patrickb> (Bedtime for me.)

[22:10] * lizmat also: sleep&

[22:28] <timo2> callsite is for the site of the call, you can always try to call a sub with an incompatible callsite, the compiler (optimizer) tries to give you an error if it can prove it won't work, but it could be different in the location you're looking at
