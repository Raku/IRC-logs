[02:40] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1920

[02:41] <MasterDuke> ^^^ unrelated to questions about MVMP6intBody

[03:04] <MasterDuke> lizmat: it looks like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3f6ac5a2d30ec48b64ca865220e3bd308cc27440 broke t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t

[03:05] <MasterDuke> weird that's it not on all ci jobs though...

[03:13] <MasterDuke> oh right, now rakudo has separate build and test jobs

[03:16] <MasterDuke> all the fails for my pr were caused by t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t, so it seemed safe to merge

[14:09] <timo> MasterDuke, can you put printf's or something in P6int.c's mk_storage_spec to tell you what the ALIGNOF results in for the different sizes?

[14:10] <timo> i get an alignof of 4 for int32

[15:14] <lizmat> MasterDuke: re c153f9f70b is it supposed to make things faster?   I don't see it  :-(   and possibly the opposite

[22:27] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i definitely saw slightly faster rakudo compilation

[22:27] <MasterDuke> what did you see slower?

[22:29] <MasterDuke> and i don't really know how it could make anything slower

[22:42] <lizmat> well, if the check for absence would take more than the check for 0 elements, I guess ?
