[13:06] <patrickb> I've refined the different ideas surrounding NativeCall vararg support on the problem-solving issue, incorporating some of the thoughts expressed on the channel here. (https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/473)

[13:09] <patrickb> I'd welcome feedback. I am willing to work on the implementation, but I'd like to reach consensus on the approach we'll take first.
