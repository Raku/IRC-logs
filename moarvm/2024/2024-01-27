[12:58] <patrickb> I have changed the lastexpayload op in the lego and expr jit. How do I test them now? Can I make moar insta-jit everything? How can I inspect which tiles the expr jit compiled my expression to?

[13:00] <lizmat> patrickb: good questions, that I wished I had answers for   perhaps Nicholas nine jnthn  ?

[13:01] <lizmat> afk&

[13:01] <patrickb> lizmat: o/ Nice reading you! How is life?

[16:59] <lizmat> patrickb: could be better, can't complain though  :-)

[17:01] <patrickb> I'm in Berlin at the moment. I'm away from home for two weeks (work).

[17:02] <lizmat> aahh...Berlin, the city where my parents got married  :-)

[17:56] <lizmat> so what is the current way to get a heap snapshot?   --profile-kind=heap   does not seem to generate anything?

[19:38] <MasterDuke> lizmat: huh. that's new

[19:38] <MasterDuke> wonder when that happened

[19:39] <lizmat> well, this is on a M1, maybe that has something to do with it ?

[19:39] <MasterDuke> nope, same here

[19:40] <lizmat> ok, so I'm not alone  :-)

[19:53] <MasterDuke> hm. i can't generate one with commitable for 2020.01. but admittedly this is a fiddly way of testing...

[19:54] <MasterDuke> because i'm pretty sure it wasn't broken back then

[20:03] <MasterDuke> lizmat: looks like `--profile-kind=heap --profile=foo.heap` works. i.e., you need both `--profile-kind=heap` and setting a name that ends in '.heap'

[20:06] <MasterDuke> either by itself won't create a heap snapshot
