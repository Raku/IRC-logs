[15:36] <lizmat> Sometimes I don't understand why things don't work on Windows

[15:39] <lizmat> doesn't precomp on https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Text::Emoji

[15:40] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Text::Emoji doesn't precomp on Windows

[15:40] <lizmat> it has 2 large constant lookup hashes

[15:42] <lizmat> if I remove "constanr" from them, it works

[15:42] <lizmat> I don't see how having something done at compile time should matter whether it is on Windows or not

[15:52] <lizmat> apart from the C-compiler used

[15:52] <lizmat> hence me posting this find here

[16:25] <ugexe> i wouldn't expect raku 'constant' to have any connection to C at all. anyway maybe its worth writing a small one-liner that generates a huge hash and does a similar lookup (similar to some of the out of the ordinary performance examples i've been posting to issues lately)

[16:26] <ugexe> i guess writing a 1 onliner is a bit more difficult since it would need to generate a module and then run a process that uses that module

[16:27] <lizmat> yeah, it only appears to happen during precomp afaics

[16:27] <lizmat> do you have another theory as to why this wouldn't work on Windows?

[16:28] <lizmat> any other variables that I'm missing ?

[16:29] <lizmat> actually, the Text::Emoji dist has a generator script in the tools dir

[16:29] <lizmat> the other reason I just thought of, is some kind of issue in grapheme handling that shows up on Windows?

[16:32] <ugexe> i'd probably still try to test if it is related to sizes somehow, i.e. if a hash of similar size but without emoji also crashes it

[17:17] <timo> it just occured to me that we should take the raku ops .so stuff and put it directly into the runners we are already compiling anyway

[17:18] <timo> need to double-check if the "rakudo early build" thingie can also work without a .so
