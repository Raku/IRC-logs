[11:50] <ab5tract> ooc, what's the reason for storing boot type references per thread context? or am I misunderstanding `tc->instance->boot_types.BOOTInt`?

[20:00] <patrickb> Hi everyone!

[20:03] <ab5tract> hey hey :)

[20:04] <patrickb> I have opened three Moar PRs related to the behavior &return in LEAVE phasers in January. Consensus about the behavioral change has just been reached. Is there any guideline how we want to merge PRs? I fear if I don't push the merge button myself, the PRs will lie dormant for a long time.

[20:04] <patrickb> I did touch frame related code though, so a second set of eyes might not be too bad of an idea.

[20:07] <patrickb> #1782, #1785 and #1788

[20:16] <lizmat> would it be ok to lift his into the 2024.06 release ?

[20:16] <lizmat> we're very close to 2024.05

[20:19] <patrickb> lizmat: I'm absolutely ok with not merging this right now. I just don't want this to sit there for another four months without any clear way forward.

[20:20] <lizmat> unless someone disagrees, I will merge after the release

[21:26] <nine> Needs proper review first
