[20:38] <timo> https://github.com/GlinkieGamesInc/longjmp_win64 this could be an option for getting windows to no longer explode

[20:38] <timo> can we add apache2 licensed stuff to moarvm?

[22:10] <[Coke]> would it be in 3rdparty?

[22:11] <[Coke]> I think then it would be easy to add that license info to LICENSE, and Apache2 is (I am not a lawyer) a safe OSS license for us to use.

[22:13] <timo> yeah it would go into 3rdparty, i don't think it's packaged anywhere

[22:13] <timo> well, "packaged", we're talking about windows builds here
