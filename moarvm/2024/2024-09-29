[17:43] <timo> so i'm wondering how best to make processes launched from a moar that has the debugserver turned on also be attached by the moar debugger if they are "compatible"

[17:45] <timo> on linux i can probably fork from the moar process very early with PTRACE_TRACEME or what it's called, which will give us a process that gets notified every time a fork and/or exec happens and can read from and write to the process's address space, and should be able to place hardware breakpoints as well as software breakpoints (stealing from binutils-gdb is probably not possible license-wise.

[17:45] <timo> maybe lldb though?)
