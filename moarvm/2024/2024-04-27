[13:33] <Woodi> itoa takes buffer and itoa knows (or can) string length before using bufer, maybe just itoa can allocate it and return as param ? I think current itoa have 5 different length it operates on

[13:36] <Woodi> just one more preprocessor macro ;)

[13:39] <Woodi> wait, such macro can be used just before calling itoa...
