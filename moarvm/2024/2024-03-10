[19:57] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i think the mingw32 target is actually 32-bit. but i think it broke because libuv stopped supporting mingw. i'm fine with dropping it, we have the native windows build and i think i've heard people report it builds fine on WSL. actually, we should probably replace the mingw32 CI job with a WSL job

[19:58] <lizmat> if we drop 32-bit, then I think we can also remove quite a bit of code that mimics 64 bit ints on 32-bit hardware

[19:58] <lizmat> primspec values 4,5,6,7,8,9 I believe

[19:58] <MasterDuke> that would be nice

[19:59] <MasterDuke> hm...are some of the older raspberry pis 32-bit?

[19:59] <lizmat> well, don't know...   that's why I asked  :-)

[20:17] <Voldenet> rpi B and 2 are 32-bit only

[20:17] <Voldenet> all rpis have supported 32-bit os though

[20:17] <lizmat> so do we still build on those platforms ?

[20:20] <Voldenet> the only builds I see are arm64
