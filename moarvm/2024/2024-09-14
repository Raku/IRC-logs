[04:52] <ugexe> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/37210#issuecomment-2226809722 - i think this might be the issue i had with my appveyor builds failing

[04:55] <ugexe> I wonder if we could just use 1.0 / 0.0 and -1.0 / 0.0 and drop the other variants for https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/570db2612d4e7f9274604bb8d990d7fd3ffd132e/src/math/num.h#L9-L20

[17:35] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: ugexe++ created pull request #1838: Improve NAN and INFINITY definitions for MSVC

[17:35] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1838

[17:45] <[Coke]> ugexe: I tried to build that on my wintop, but the moarvm branch is old, and I had trouble doing the rebase.

[17:46] <[Coke]> ... let me try one more thing...

[17:49] <[Coke]> (nuking my old moarvm windows install from orbit)

[17:56] <[Coke]> so if I start over, then try to do a git rebase origin/main in your branch, the merge goes sideways. 

[17:56] * [Coke] will try to just apply this as a patch locally

[17:59] <[Coke]> (this would be easier if I wasn't an idiot)

[18:02] <[Coke]> that last time, I tried to add your moarvm remote to *NQP* and then merge. wow.

[18:02] <[Coke]> finally got past all that and it dies trying to process the submodules in 3rdparty/cmp

[18:11] <ugexe> can you post the full error?

[18:12] <ugexe> it looks like its building in https://dev.azure.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/_build/results?buildId=1539&view=logs&j=70f6b8a1-f3cf-5727-bd79-d08ddb1caf67

[18:28] <ugexe> i wonder if we should switch `#define MVM_NUM_POSINF  (DBL_MAX+DBL_MAX)` to `#define MVM_NUM_POSINF  1.0 / 0.0` on msvc like it is for other OS. i thought 1.0 / 0.0 was defined in C to mean infinity, whereas adding two DBL_MAX presumably just overflows (which to me seems like it wouldnt work right, but I'm not very knowledgeable about any of this either)

[22:56] <[Coke]> ugexe: https://gist.github.com/coke/ddaa603d58a5cae7f46fcb330bfb7fb1

[23:02] <timo>   Found C:\raku\bin\moar.exe version 2024.07, which is too old. Wanted at least 2024.08-6-gac82e446f

[23:03] <timo> you will need to update that, or other stuff will also just violently and randomly asplode, i sometimes find

[23:03] <timo> Updating submodules .................................... fatal: transport 'file' not allowed

[23:04] <timo> this is a security feature where you can't "git clone" from a relative file url or something like that

[23:04] <timo> try `git submodule uninit` or what it's called, followed by `git submodule init` && `git submodule update`

[23:05] <timo> may be required to `git submodule sync` to change the remote addresses for the submodules to the ones in the .gitmodules file that's checked in

[23:06] <[Coke]> "need to update that" - I'm rebuilding it?

[23:06] <[Coke]> will try the submodule stuff

[23:07] <timo> you seem to be rebuilding rakudo, not moar

[23:08] <timo> oh it's --gen-moar

[23:08] <timo> i keep forgetting that that exists

[23:29] <[Coke]> timo: did deinit, init, update (failed) sync (ok) update (failed) - both failures are still "did not contain 3c5a..."

[23:31] <[Coke]> this appears to only happen on the ugexe/fix-msvc-infinity-nan branch - if I checkout moarvm origin's main branch, 'git submodule update' works fine.

[23:31] <[Coke]> ... but if I switch *back*, the update works? weird.

[23:32] <[Coke]> at some point there's an entirely fresh copy of MoarVM in here as well, this isn't still the very old one I built my windows from last time

[23:32] <timo> let me have a second look

[23:33] <timo> * 3c5a72e - (HEAD) TRUE and FALSE don't exist everywhere (7 years ago) <Timo Paulssen>

[23:33] <[Coke]> eh. It's building now that I did the update on the main/ branch

[23:33] <timo> this is the commit that it's trying to get

[23:34] <[Coke]> ok, new error: "cannot open include file: 'dynload.h'

[23:34] <[Coke]> I haven't built on windows in ages, so guessing this is also on main with my current setup (which also just had a forced upgrade to win11 classic)
