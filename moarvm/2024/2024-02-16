[12:34] <Nicholas> It's afernoon and I'm still having coffee bootstrapping problems. (Failed to start by boiling water)

[12:34] <Nicholas> Oh wait, afternoon is myth. It's still morning

[12:34] <Nicholas> That explains everything :-)

[12:41] <lizmat> Nicholas o/   long time no see, hope you're well!

[12:46] <Nicholas> I'm well. And I have coffee

[12:50] * lizmat has tea

[12:53] <lizmat> and what brings you to #moarvm this morning ?

[12:53] <Nicholas> I felt like sharing my coffee problems :-)

[12:59] <lizmat> glad to hear they're solved, right ?

[13:00] <Nicholas> well, ish. The cup is empty (again). No idea how that happens. I think it must have a hole somewhere

[13:03] <lizmat> .oO( there's a whole in my cuppa,.... :-)

[13:03] <lizmat> *hole  :-)

[13:03] <Nicholas> well, it *was* a whole cuppa. Now it's just a hole where a coffee used to be

[13:04] <xiaomiao> possibly evaporation

[13:12] * lizmat imagines the effect of a saturated coffee atmosphere

[13:23] <lizmat> .oO( just take a deep breath :-)

[13:52] <[Coke]> ... crap, this conversation made my coffee vanish

[13:53] * [Coke] invites everyone over for a cup of hot beverage at their convenience.

[13:57] <[Coke]> Nicholas: I got a breville as a gift and now I have all my coffee needs packed into one device, it's amazing.
