[06:24] <nine> Does this really require support from MoarVM or could you just use NativeCall and a library like https://github.com/yusiwen/libptytty?

[06:36] <Woodi> patrickb: gdb can do remote debugging for C part, you want something like "live" debug for nqp or Rakudo ? :)

[06:53] <patrickb> nine: libptytty does away with all the OS differences. It doesn't help with turning a file descriptor into an IO::Handle. That's the issue I started out with.

[06:55] <patrickb> nine: Also I want the debugger to not need any non Raku dependencies (It's  real bummer to require the users to install a compiler toolchain only to use a *Raku*-debugger.

[06:56] <patrickb> Woodi: The Moar debugger interface is via network. So it naturally already supports remote debugging. What's "live" debugging?

[06:59] <nine> I guess we'd need at least a syscall for exposing MVM_file_handle_from_fd then

[07:00] <nine> But you don't need a compiler toolchain for NativeCall?

[07:06] <patrickb> nine: True. But I'd need to have that lib installed.

[07:08] <patrickb> I haven't looked deeply into it yet, but from what I've seen the MVMHandles know what they can and can't do. So one would at least need to provide capability info next to an FD in MVM_file_handle_from_fd.

[07:08] <nine> You're going to need it anyway. Either as a direct dependency of MoarVM or just for the debugger. The alternative would be to implement the exact same functionality in MoarVM that the lib already provides and that sounds quite wasteful.

[07:08] <patrickb> It seems to me I'd have to introduce a new handle type in moar.

[07:10] <patrickb> I'll definitely not reimplement stuff that's already available in a lib. I am grateful for that link!

[07:10] <nine> But yeah, needing a new handle type may stack the deck in favor of providing fully integrated support in moar

[07:12] <Woodi> patrickb: live like pause on every action

[07:14] <patrickb> Woodi: IIUC that sounds like a typical debugger. Moar already does that. The only good frontend is the Comma IDE at the moment though. I just started working on a TUI frontend.
