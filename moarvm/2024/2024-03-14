[00:53] <coleman> Anyone interested in a Meson-based build? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1795

[02:14] <MasterDuke> i've never used meson, don't really have an opinion

[02:16] <coleman> I'm gonna give it a shot. I'll post questions as they come up while I work in my fork.

[02:16] <MasterDuke> cool

[03:48] <coleman> So it doesn't seem like we're doing huge amounts of codegen. Just a few additional source files from Configure.pl and make? My analysis: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1795#issuecomment-1996299090

[06:53] <Voldenet> I'm guessing that configure.pl wasn't supposed to grow to be this large

[06:53] <Voldenet> but it kept growing with features

[06:55] <Voldenet> https://github.com/dontlaugh/MoarVM/blob/a38756ee9b41c494ecfd8ec9c1bfe393896d9cac/Configure.pl

[06:55] <Voldenet> â€¦started as short as expected

[06:59] <Voldenet> though I've never used anything that was as pain-free as Configure.pl

[13:02] <ugexe> coleman: does macOS come with python? or would we expect users to need to install python as a dependency, which is unlike the current perl situation?

[13:03] <ugexe> i'm not sure i'd be thrilled at having to install a scripting language to install raku, although thats already the case on windows so ðŸ¤·

[13:04] <lizmat> % python --version

[13:04] <lizmat> zsh: command not found: python

[13:05] <lizmat> % perl --version

[13:05] <lizmat> This is perl 5, version 30, subversion 3 (v5.30.3) built for darwin-thread-multi-2level

[13:06] <lizmat> ah, looks like that is a local one

[13:06] <lizmat> % perl --version

[13:06] <lizmat> This is perl 5, version 28, subversion 0 (v5.28.0) built for darwin-2level

[13:06] <lizmat> looks like MacOS doesn't install python by default

[13:07] <lizmat> % uname -v

[13:07] <lizmat> Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Wed Feb 21 21:44:31 PST 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.15~2/RELEASE_X86_64

[13:07] <ugexe> you are still running x86 mac?

[13:08] <lizmat> x86 on my MBP, 1 on my MacMini

[13:08] <lizmat> *M1

[13:08] <ugexe> (not relevant to the perl/pythong thing, just thought you had something newer)

[13:08] <lizmat> % uname -v

[13:08] <lizmat> Darwin Kernel Version 23.2.0: Wed Nov 15 21:53:34 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.61.3~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103

[13:20] <Voldenet> Hm, if meson requires python then that's pretty bad actually

[13:21] <Voldenet> sh or perl are fine though

[13:23] <Voldenet> otoh most people really only need binaries, so it depends if meson is lifechanging

[13:29] <ugexe> yeah, honestly itâ€™s only a matter of time before macOS stops shipping Perl although it might be many years away 

[13:37] <lizmat> also: bash as an alternative on MacOS would confine you to an old(er) version: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252176464?sortBy=best

[13:45] <[Coke]> my mac has a /usr/bin/perl (5.30.3)

[13:50] <Nicholas> my (works) mac has 5.30. and 5.34 and /usr/bin/python3

[13:50] <Nicholas> but also plenty of "binaries" in /usr/bin are written in perl. eg /usr/bin/fuser

[13:50] <lizmat> aha!

[13:50] <lizmat> % python3 --version

[13:50] <lizmat> Python 3.9.6

[13:50] <Nicholas> Looks like there would be a *lot* of rewriting for Apple to get rid of /usr/bin/perl

[13:51] <lizmat> % python3 --version

[13:51] <lizmat> Python 3.9.1

[13:51] <lizmat> that last one on the x86

[13:51] <lizmat> so it looks like there's python on MacOS after all, if you know how to invoke it  :-)

[14:41] <coleman> If this ever becomes a PR it will live side by side with the Perl, for sure. It's been a while since I set up a new mac. Do you still have to run that xcode-tools-install thingy to get clang or system headers?

[14:47] <coleman> I've never had any trouble building MoarVM. The Perl actually looks awesome. I even put together my own custom build container just to run the docs site CI. This is just an experiment to stay ahead of the curve. 

[14:49] <lizmat> coleman: yes

[14:50] <coleman> I could imagine a scenario where some new distro or OS comes along that breaks the perl build but not a Meson one, or the other way around. If a library moves or isn't packaged the same way, etc. Options here can help maintenance. Building C wil always be an effort. :D

[14:51] <coleman> Anyways, this will take a long time. I'll update the issue with questions as they come along.
