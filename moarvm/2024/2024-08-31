[19:59] <timo> could there be a little-endian/big-endian problem?

[20:07] <timo> maybe this is related to in-situ strings?

[20:48] <timo> we should definitely semi-regularly test moar on a big endian system. at least a 64bit system, but probably a good idea to also test it on 32bit systems?

[20:51] <ab5tract> I honestly think 32 bit is pointless and unnecessary, but I know there are others who feel do

[20:51] <ab5tract> *different

[20:53] <ab5tract> If we do decide to care, there should be a cutoff

[20:54] <ugexe> FreeBSD is dropping 32bit support 

[20:54] <ab5tract> Can you even spin up a 32 bit container in AWS, GCP, or Azure?

[20:55] <ab5tract> If not, we need to drop it out of being unable to test

[20:55] <timo> well, if we don't support 32bit at all, we should make that an official thing

[20:55] <timo> isn't it relatively easy to run 32bit stuff on a 64bit linux?

[20:55] <ab5tract> timo: fair. But last time I tried (like almost 10 years ago) it was broken

[20:55] <timo> what "it" exactly was that?

[20:55] <ugexe> I imagine any 32bit usage of rakudo is on arm 

[20:56] <ab5tract> compiling rakudo

[20:56] <timo> i'm looking for a linux distro that is offered for some 64bit big endian system that i can emulate with qemu-system

[21:01] <timo> i'll be trying adelielinux

[21:30] <timo> i'll share the disk image when i have something half-usable
