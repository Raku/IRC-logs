[22:40] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/LICENSE#L23-L32 has license info for the complete 3rd party libraries, but for snippets of code i think we usually just inline something, e.g., https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/strings/utf8.c#L3

[23:47] <[Coke]> As someone who has to deal with OSS attributions at work, having it in a single place might be helpful.
