[02:08] <MasterDuke> i haven't read it yet, but https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11469 looks like it might be interesting

[02:27] <timo> those are some bold claims in the abstract of that paper

[11:05] <lizmat> hmmm  looks like I git myself a relatively easy way of creating a heap corruption

[11:05] <lizmat> *got

[11:05] <lizmat> reliably

[11:18] <timo> cool, share? :)

[11:20] <lizmat> install https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/REPL?v=0.0.9

[11:20] <lizmat> install Terminal::LineEditor

[11:20] <lizmat> > repl

[11:20] <lizmat> then enter: say ²³⁴⁴/₇;

[11:21] <lizmat> I then get:

[11:21] <lizmat> rakudo(59264,0x1ec19cc00) malloc: Heap corruption detected, free list is damaged at 0x6000036bc100

[11:21] <lizmat> *** Incorrect guard value: 18433

[11:21] <lizmat> rakudo(59264,0x1ec19cc00) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

[11:22] <lizmat> on a M1 fwiw

[11:22] <timo> right

[11:22] <timo> btw did you know about "fenced paste"? that may not be the real name

[11:23] <lizmat> doesn't ring a bell

[11:23] <timo> ok that is definitely not what it's called haha

[11:23] <timo> bracketed paste

[11:24] <timo> how do i know if the repl i just started from inside the repl is the REPL repl? do i need to rakudo -Msomething?

[11:24] <lizmat> the module installs a "repl"script

[11:25] <timo> oh, > was your shell

[11:25] <lizmat> if you call "repl" as a CLI, you get the REPL version

[11:25] <lizmat> yes, sorry if that wasn't clear

[11:25] <lizmat> I meant: $ repl  , duh  :-)

[11:25] <timo> that doesn't sound like a name it's fine to squat on :D

[11:26] <timo> though of course it doesn't go into /usr/bin or anything

[11:26] <timo> still ...

[11:26] <timo> does it reproduce every time on your end?

[11:26] <lizmat> yes, every single time

[11:27] <lizmat> with the same 18433 and 0x1ec19cc00 values

[11:27] <lizmat> could be an issue in Terminal::LineEditor

[11:29] <lizmat> ah, yes, no problem with Linenoise as the editor

[11:29] <lizmat> I'll make a Terminal::LineEditor issue

[11:30] <timo> how can i tell which i'm in?

[11:31] <lizmat> what does it say when you enter "ed" ?

[11:31] <timo> Using the LineEditor editor

[11:31] <lizmat> then that's the correct one

[11:33] <timo> it's not explosive on my end, i'm running it with valgrind --trace-children=yes

[11:33] <lizmat> ok, so it's M1 specific apparently

[11:34] <timo> can you build a moar with asan?

[11:34] <timo> ever tried that?

[11:35] <timo> i just recently added some extra output to Configure.pl to help the user because there's some annoying additional steps necessary to be able to build rakudo when your moar has asan in it

[11:35] <lizmat> no, I haven't recently: every time I did that, it messed up all of my workflows

[11:36] <timo> i can imagine

[11:36] <lizmat> it's just too disruptive for me, unless I'm really working on NQP / MoarVM related stuff directly

[11:36] <timo> yeah, it's fair

[11:36] <lizmat> anyways, looks like a Terminal::LineEditor issue, so japhb will know about it  :-)

[11:37] <timo> does japhb have a silicon mac to repro this?

[11:38] <lizmat> I haz no idea: japhb is pretty busy moving house atm, so I doubt he'll have time to look at it soon anyway

[11:38] <lizmat> perhaps patrickb might  :-)

[11:42] <lizmat> https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/issues/7

[11:43] <lizmat> ok, enough excitement  :-)

[11:43] <timo> fair

[12:21] <patrickb> Me no haz M1 either...

[12:25] <patrickb> Actually I do. It's in a Mac stadium account. I use that machine for building the compiled releases.

[12:25] <patrickb> timo: Want access?

[15:42] <timo> not 100% sure i have the spare cycles to actually look deeply into this, but maybe it's not too hard to find once i point asan at it?

[16:23] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/11/25/2024-46-no-release/
