[13:18] <patrickb> Given we skip 2024.11, there is no reason, not to merge the longjmp PR, right?

[13:19] <lizmat> indeed

[13:45] <[Coke]> patrickb++\

[13:50] <lizmat> patrickb: if you merge, I'll bump NQP and Rakudo for you

[13:50] <patrickb> Cool. I'm only waiting for the tests to go through

[20:37] <[Coke]> ok, windows build is failing for me on the rakudo build, and it's on a step that is use perl to run a script that invokes moar. 

[20:37] <[Coke]> how to get more debug output from moar.exe ?

[20:55] <[Coke]> (it's just dying, no error output.)

[20:55] <[Coke]> Guess I have to figure out how to run it in the debugger.

[22:42] <coleman> [Coke]: I installed windows 10 in a VM on my desktop that's reasonably beefy. I'd like to support the windows testing effort.

[22:42] <coleman> Are you running Blin?

[22:44] <patrickb> Coke: I've had a good experience with WinDbg

[22:45] <patrickb> Don't forget to add --debug to the moar Configure.pl
