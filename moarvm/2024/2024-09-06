[19:56] <timo> hm, these changes that brrt made to dynasm, i don't see them reflected upstream. shouldn't we try to send them?

[19:59] <timo> but moar with a dynasm + minilua taken straight from upstream also builds and runs stresstest just fine. i imagine it'd crash when we hit one of the edge cases where we suddenly need one more byte than we thought for a label etc
