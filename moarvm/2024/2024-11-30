[01:02] <timo> no valgrind on macos

[01:11] <[Coke]> try leaks (man leaks)

[01:19] <[Coke]> build is btroken for me on osx right now. :(

[01:21] <[Coke]> oh, wait, I left bad debug code in, my bad. :)

[01:25] <[Coke]> before the build, the say command died. I built head in local dir... now neither local nor installed die.

[02:18] <[Coke]> here's the leaks output anyway: https://gist.github.com/coke/fc158b257153cf024d426fb292646f68

[02:19] <[Coke]> that is NOT a debug output, if it'd be helpful, can rebuild and rerun

[02:23] <timo> the crash happens in the "repl" script of the Repl module when using Terminal::LineEditor, just doing the "say" in rakudo itself doesn't do anything. the explosion happens in the getattr (MakeRaw) in enter-raw-mode (Terminal::LineEditor::something)

[02:23] <timo> but the explosion there is just a "malloc has found out that the datastructures on the heap have become corrupted at some point"

[02:24] <timo> well, it's calloc that figures it out, the calloc when creating the Termios CStruct instance

[09:16] <timo> ... the Termios struct definition is too small ...

[17:54] <[Coke]> the freshbuilt raku doesn't explode in the REPL - the old one does.

[17:57] <[Coke]> (leaks doesn't like working with the older rakubrew version of raku - keeps segfaulting)

[17:59] <[Coke]> no, now it's just segfaulting all the time, wtf.

[18:31] <timo> not mimalloc, though right?

[18:47] <[Coke]> that wasn't in the list before, no - also I was calling leaks incorrectly just now. :| Sorry for all the noise.

[18:51] <timo> the list?

[18:55] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/f6df56e5efc1f9a6929d3c44faf1c705 - here's one with the repl variant.

[18:56] <[Coke]> (looks like they are all calloc)

[18:59] <[Coke]> Use of uninitialized value $args{"os"} in string eq at Configure.pl line 469. in the config in moarvm

[19:12] <timo> mimalloc is a different allocator library

[19:12] <timo> so not sure if leaks can handle that, or if it depends on internals of the malloc impl in question

[21:42] <[Coke]> dug into current status of valgrind on m1 - "so close"
