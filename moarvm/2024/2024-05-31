[13:02] <MasterDuke> timo1: i'm only around for about 15min, but this windows business is really blowing my mind. it sort of seems like the the jeaiii itoa implementation stopped working correctly on windows

[13:02] <tellable6> 2024-05-31T11:05:52Z #raku-dev <patrickb> MasterDuke: Do you remember?

[13:04] <MasterDuke> i maybe have to spin up a windows vm and try to build my simple test file to see if anything is different there

[13:06] <MasterDuke> but i also don't understand how the previous commit, which changed to using a calloced buffer, seemed to work. but then when i do both in the most recent commit even the calloced buffer is wrong

[13:18] <MasterDuke> afk, hopefully can continue this evening

[13:36] <[Coke]> I have a windows VM I can spin back up in azure if needed to test stuff.
