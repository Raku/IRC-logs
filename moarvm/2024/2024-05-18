[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Cleanup variables in bigint ops error cases

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: In a bunch of error cases of bigint ops we weren't always cleaning up

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: all the variables. These were noticed when investigating

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1804, but I don't think they are

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: the actual cause.

[08:55] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/dbdfb3999b

[14:13] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Silence incorrect GCC warning

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: The three branches of the `if/else if` correspond to the three `case`s

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: that can enter this block, so the variable will always be initialized

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: when used.

[20:03] <MasterDuke> huh. not sure why we have the free_at_safepoint mutex https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/core/instance.h#L225. it's only ever used once https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/6model/6model.c#L80-L87 when setting the debug name on a type

[20:03] <tellable6> 2024-05-18T12:48:25Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> MasterDuke17: thanks for the review on the MoarVM PR. Somehow I didn't get pinged about them in the GH app
