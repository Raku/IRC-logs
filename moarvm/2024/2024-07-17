[02:13] <MasterDuke> i've caught two spectest fails with rr. one was in t/spec/S02-types/mix.t with an optimized moarvm and it resulted in a sigkill. the other was in t/02-rakudo/15-gh_1202.t with an un-optimized moarvm and resulted in failed test for matching shell output of something

[02:14] <MasterDuke> however, i've recompiled both moarvm and rakudo since then, though i don't believe there were any changes in moarvm and all changes in rakudo are likely unrelated

[02:29] <MasterDuke> i think there's a way to package up rr recordings, anybody interested in taking a shot at these?

[03:14] <MasterDuke> ugh, the t/02-rakudo/15-gh_1202.t recording might not be useful, the spawning of shells seems to have confused it very much

[08:15] <timo> MasterDuke: when you have a recording with a lot of processes being spawned, it can help to have "rr replay" with the "mark stdio" flag and use the numbers it spits out with -g, then you'll land in the process you want

[08:29] <timo> "rr pack" will make a recording independent of files on your system so a recompile doesn't give you trouble
