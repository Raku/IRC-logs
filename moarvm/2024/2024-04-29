[00:18] <MasterDuke> ab5tract: i'm not aware of anything explicitly preventing it, but nine and/or dbw would probably know best

[02:50] <MasterDuke> i just got nqp building with a rebase of in-situ-strings up to the HEAD of main, but rakudo dies with 'MoarVM oops: MVM_nfg_get_synthetic_info call requested a synthetic codepoint that does not exist.

[02:50] <MasterDuke> Requested synthetic 85 when only 1 have been created.'

[02:52] <MasterDuke> don't think i've ever seen that error before
