[21:02] <[Coke]> if this bisect is to be trusted, I was able to build moarvm on windows 11 until bfa7a23091bed

[21:02] <linkable6> (2024-11-11) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/bfa7a23091 Merge pull request #1857 from MasterDuke17/add_missing_initializers

[21:03] <[Coke]> which, looking at the commit, seems ridiculous. :)

[21:09] <timo> hm. something went wrong based on which previous commit you were on perhaps? i assume you didn't "nmake clean" before? but also, i think "clean" doesn't clean out anything in 3rdparty

[21:16] <timo> which would be extra funny if that was the issue because "nmake install" seemed to already rebuild everything

[21:16] <timo> but what if it wasn't "everything enough"?

[21:22] <[Coke]> i am doing nmake clean. what's the most clean I can do ?

[21:23] <[Coke]> trying again with distclean

[21:32] <[Coke]> ... with a distclean, I got a clean moarvm build on that commit... which is HEAD. wtf.

[21:32] <[Coke]> ok, going to just go read a book for a while and maybe this will make sense when I return. :)

[22:07] <timo> oof
