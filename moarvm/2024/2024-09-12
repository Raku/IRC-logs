[03:35] <Woodi> patrickb: s/helper program/helper function/ probably

[07:17] <patrickb> Woodi: I actually meant helper program as in a separate executable file. But: I could just as well add a hidden command line option to the moar executable and make moar exec itself. But apart from saving myself to tune the build system, it's the same thing.

[09:36] <timo> i think turning off the jit may have made rakudo compile successfully

[10:49] <ab5tract> timo: awesome! Is it clear what arch is used by these runners? I would assume x64 because Wintel, but aarch64 is supposedly cheaper and this is M$, so..

[10:50] <ab5tract> Also: my sincere apologies for (I think) partially prompting you to go down this rabbit hole

[10:59] <timo> there is no jit on aarch64 so turning off jit wouldn't have made a difference

[11:03] <timo> do you have time to look into the Test::Scheduler for that Throttle/vent-at=>0 thing? i think the PR is waiting for a signal from you

[11:17] <timo> maybe someone wants to contribute a /Yc + /Yu patch for building moar on MSVC with precompiled headers

[11:17] <timo> maybe that will make things faster

[11:17] <timo> also check if /MT helps at all, but for that we need to put multiple input files in one invocation rather than the one-source-per-call we have right now which is obviously easier to make a makefile for, especially when working with nmake

[11:18] <timo> also, maybe gmake is available in these runners and we can have a non-shit makefile

[11:19] <timo> nope, the only "make" i see in the "included software" page is "CMake"

[11:19] <timo> i bet powershell can be fun if you learn it a bit

[13:03] <ugexe> I pushed a small zef update to a branch and now my appveyor CI fails when compiling rakudo heh

[13:03] <ugexe> er moar rather 

[13:03] <ugexe> compiling src\main.obj

[13:03] <ugexe> main.c

[13:03] <ugexe> C:\projects\rakudo\nqp\MoarVM\src\math/num.h(23): error C2099: initializer is not a constant

[13:04] <timo> static const MVMnum64 MVM_NUM_NAN = NAN;

[13:06] <ugexe> Did anything change related to that recently?

[13:07] <ugexe> The last successful ci run for zef was 2 months ago to give a time frame 

[13:09] <timo> that file has last been touched at all 3 years ago

[13:21] <ugexe> That makes it seem like NAAN has recently become defined so that it takes the first path in that conditional 

[13:21] <ugexe> Since https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/570db2612d4e7f9274604bb8d990d7fd3ffd132e/src/math/num.h#L10 did not error 

[13:22] <ugexe> (Typing on a phone)

[13:35] <timo> you can try supplying /EP to the C compiler arguments, that will output what the preprocessor has done to standard output. it will be a huge output for every file you do it with, so ideally only do it for a single file. you can put that in the CL environment variable and the compiler will pick it up

[13:42] <ab5tract> timo: I wasnâ€™t sure if it was automatically disabled based on arch. Makes sense, but Iâ€™ve had my hands in the guts of that part of nqp-configure and straightforward it is not

[13:43] <ab5tract> Iâ€™ve been banging my head on Comma  and going in circles. Iâ€™ll take a break and look at that PR tonight.

[13:44] <ab5tract> (Re: jit, what I mean is I wouldnâ€™t have been surprised to find that it was disabled based on os + arch, rather than on arch alone)

[14:29] <ugexe> i'll give that a try later

[14:38] <timo> aw crap, since the cache runs at the very end, it will actually put rakudo + nqp + moar in the nqp and the moar cache instead of just the parts i want

[14:39] <timo> guess i have to move stuff sideways first ...
