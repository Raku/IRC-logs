[11:12] <timo> ah, you mean the spesh log output, i was confused there for a minute what you meant

[11:13] <timo> yeah the literal value is in reality a pointer to an MVMCallsite, so i changed it to follow the pointer and output the callsite instead of the number, and also i get the known value for the thing being invoked and look up the symbol name to show what c func it's runcing

[11:19] <timo> for a little while i thought the number in question was the pointer to the c function but that is not true
