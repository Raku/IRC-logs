[14:53] <ugexe> Can someone reopen https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1776#issuecomment-2424858866 ? I can’t seem to do so and I’m having trouble figuring out why it should be closed. It’s actually a bit frustrating given the amount of work and conversation in that PR that it would be closed 

[14:53] <ugexe> (the PR not the specific comment I linked to)
