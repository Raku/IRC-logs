[00:59] <tellable6> timo, I saw JimmyZ 2021-10-11T03:51:00Z in #moarvm: <JimmyZ> jnthnwrthngtn, nine, brrt ^

[01:07] <timo> we probably want to bring our dyncall mirror up to date. the mirror we have lists version 1.2 as "upcoming", with just a single changelog entry, while the upstream changelog has a load of changes for 1.2, as well as the 1.3 and 1.4 versions, plus 1.5 (upcoming): https://dyncall.org/pub/dyncall/dyncall/file/5ec41b820858/ChangeLog

[01:08] <timo> (there's a breaking change in version 1.4)

[01:11] <timo> the changes aren't earth-shattering, but maybe someone would get a kick out of moarvm on riscv64

[08:31] <nine> Do we even want to keep dyncall? I seem to remember that libffi could replace it completely.

[12:31] <patrickb> I think the biggest blocker was libffis unavailability on Windows. I think that has changed. We don't currently package libffi. That would have to happen first.

[12:48] <timo> with --has-libffi i have now reached rakudo compilation
