[18:14] <timo> i'm getting terrible ideas related to peephole optimization for the jit

[18:14] <timo> nothing anywhere close to "formulated" of course

[18:15] <lizmat> oh dear...

[18:16] <timo> first of all i have to get not just jit_debug but also jitdump to work so that perf can actually put numbers next to assembly instructions instead of just summed up per frame

[18:18] <timo> it's kinda really inconvenient tbh
