[03:54] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: If we're comparing 8-bit strings and there's a difference, but no

[03:54] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: synthetics involved, we don't need to go through the generic grapheme

[03:54] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: iterator path.

[09:34] <lizmat> not much, will keep monitoring

[09:36] <lizmat> hmmm  could have been a time machine backup running at the same time  :-)

[20:51] <timo> hm. do we just never get line numbers in backtraces when we are in a jitted frame?
