[02:00] <MasterDuke> jnthn: do you have any suggestions for debugging? should things like numbers of fates match up exactly with the moarvm backend?

[12:19] <lizmat> MasterDuke: where would I find the logic for reading actualy bytecode needed from a file set up with nqp::loadbytecode ?

[12:19] <lizmat> this re: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5551

[12:39] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Don't know for sure but I think the number of fates should be consistent, since those depend on the number of alternations or number of protoregexes

[12:39] <jnthn> Although we have a bunch of #?if moar stuff that in principle could be in the grammar

[17:01] <MasterDuke> jnthn: thanks. i was worried about `#?if moar`, but there are far fewer in nqp, and it looks like no relevant ones in the grammar, so hopefully i can get a decent comparison

[18:15] <lizmat> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/6model/serialization.c#L2780-L2796 feels like it describes what I'm seeing

[18:16] <lizmat> "stub the NQPClassHOW object, add deserialization request to work list, release lock and return the stub

[18:17] <lizmat> but then again, I'm really out of my depth here  :-(

[19:03] <lizmat> Q: do we have any MoarVM bytecode inspection tool ?

[23:27] *** sena_kun left
[23:33] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i'm not aware of anything particularly targeting bytecode. there's --dump of course if you just want to see what itis

[23:46] <MasterDuke> jnthn, nine, or timo1 might know of something
