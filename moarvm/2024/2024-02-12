[07:44] <Woodi> lizmat: but list and hashes are treadsafe - operations on them ? but in case of "metamodels" that probably can be treated as separate subsystem that is moustly used at boot time or pre-object-creation so can be moustly read-only, which could help with coping. and if metamodels can evolve then some locking protocol on them will be needed so they can stay predictibly r-o.  checking version or lock on evry 

[07:44] <Woodi> usage would be bad for performance and metamodels don't need to be modified often

[07:44] <Woodi> but I have no clue about details of implementation...
