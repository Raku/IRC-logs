[17:34] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: dontlaugh++ created pull request #1839: Add example scripts using the Zulip API

[17:34] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1839

[17:43] <coleman> If we need to smuggle test results out of various CI systems, we could use Zulip; see my PR if you're interested. We have a rarely-used Zulip instance.

[17:51] <coleman> example https://envs.sh/d78

[17:59] <timo> not sure what exactly to do with it yet

[18:01] <coleman> no big deal; I just want you to know it's there. I think we'll always be running tests and stuff all over the place, and the built-in UX for CI systems can sometimes not be the nicest permanent record of what happened

[18:02] <timo> well, azure pipelines throws everything away after 10 days (except the latest 3 or so). no clue how far up that can be configured

[18:04] <coleman> timo: one question; who's account is the Azure stuff in?

[18:08] <timo> "organization owner" says infra@rakulang.net i assume that's patrickb

[18:10] *** sena_kun joined
[19:19] <patrickb> nope. It's a meta account once put in place by Roman and I hope been taken over by the infra team. At least IIRC.

[19:20] <coleman> We haven't logged in, afaik. I will look into it.
