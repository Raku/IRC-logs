[00:11] <timo> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1059502 - we should probably move some stuff out of the ldlibs config var if we have ecosystem modules just taking those flags to get "a working compiler commandline" like NativeLibs does

[00:12] <timo> actually, taking variables that were used for building moarvm in order to build modules on the system moar is installed on is Very Wrong in the first place

[00:18] <timo> i'm sure there is plenty of prior art to learn from / be horrified by

[00:42] <MasterDuke> timo: how do i get your 3rdparty/dynasm update?

[00:43] <MasterDuke> a configure gives `Updating submodules .................................... fatal: remote error: upload-pack: not our ref 847ea5d910c706cc7b69bffe0a5f0567fd2b15bd`

[00:47] <timo> oh? does `git submodule update` help?

[00:47] <timo> i think that's what Configure tries to do

[00:49] <timo> huh the github actions also failed

[00:50] <timo> wow, i just totally flubbed that huh

[00:50] <timo> try again please

[01:06] <MasterDuke> good now

[01:32] <timo> can we have something that immediately flags moarvm panics in any of the outputs from builds as something to look closer at?

[01:37] <MasterDuke> well, ideally our CI is green, and those would turn it red because they'll probably cause a test to fail...

[01:37] <MasterDuke> it was green for a little while, but the rakudo jvm build is broken again
