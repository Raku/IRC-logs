[01:09] <[Coke]> coleman: I think we're skipping the release this month.

[01:09] <[Coke]> Not running blin at the moment.

[01:09] <[Coke]> and away from my win machine.

[01:09] <[Coke]> (debug, windbg - Thanks!)

[01:31] <[Coke]> f

[17:30] <[Coke]> patrickb: I've installed windbg - I was able to get it to attach to the failing moarvm process... and then it seems to hang and not die (have tried continuing with go/step, nothing) - see either a single or bunch of threads, but no exception

[20:13] <timo> were you able to see if it also starts a process of its own perhaps?

[20:19] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/debugserver_loaded_file_notifications: 79676c282b | (Timo Paulssen)++ | 3 files

[20:19] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/debugserver_loaded_file_notifications: "really loaded" flag for breakpoint file entries

[20:19] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/debugserver_loaded_file_notifications: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/79676c282b

[20:25] <[Coke]> Sorry, yes. Was able to go back and stuff all the command line args in and kick it off. got something, maybe.

[20:26] <timo> cool

[20:26] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/d1daf4bb96892e933b7476208149bfae

[20:28] <timo> huh. that's what it would look like if we haven't "turned unwinding off"

[20:28] <[Coke]> added the callsite info for 0x7

[20:31] <timo> should be able to MVM_dump_backtrace(0x2d346060200) and print ((MVMObject *)0x2d34d2e7028)->st[0] to get a bit of info about the involved object

[20:32] <timo> able to call MVM_dump_blabla etc etc

[20:32] <timo> not that i know how to do that exactly in windbg

[20:37] <[Coke]> WARNING: Continuing a non-continuable exception

[20:37] <[Coke]> ntdll!RtlRaiseStatus+0x3d:

[20:37] <[Coke]> 00007ffa`276ffa4d 65488b0c2560000000 mov   rcx,qword ptr gs:[60h] gs:00000000`00000060=????????????????

[20:38] <timo> that's an odd spelling for that thing

[20:38] <[Coke]> The print is complaining "Couldn't resolve error at..."

[20:42] <timo> so i think we should be able to break before the longjmp happens with a condition that checks if we're in jitted code, which i think tc->jit_return_address being nonzero would tell us

[20:44] <timo> does the windbg you are using have the "go back" button? i.e. time-travelling debugger support?

[20:46] <[Coke]> it's advertising time traveling.

[20:46] <[Coke]> I can also set a breakpoint somewhere and rerun it

[20:46] <[Coke]> time travel options greyed out

[20:46] <timo> you probably have to start it with time traveling turned on before it can be used

[20:48] <timo> "start it" being the target program

[20:51] <[Coke]> I'm going to have to play with this a bit, I'm afraid.

[20:52] <timo> i guess at the point we're at inside the unwind attempt we just can't run shit because the stack is borken?

[20:53] <patrickb> Just to be extra sure, does the Moar source contain this commit: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/385827cffe0e9816c70491e867796b13712e3806

[20:54] <patrickb> to enable time travelling you need to tick some checkbox in the run program dialog (before starting the debugging)

[20:57] <[Coke]> no on the commit (rebuilding), understood on the time travel

[20:58] <timo> oh, well, that commit is really necessary haha

[21:01] <[Coke]> typo in that commit: "it's *second*" should be "its *second*"

[21:02] <[Coke]> hoping for a completely different error on this rebuild. :)

[21:11] <[Coke]> same error in rakudo build process.

[21:11] <[Coke]> time travel complaining about someone else using a text file..

[21:11] <timo> ah

[21:11] <timo> you still had some process running

[21:11] <timo> "text" there is like "text section" and refers to a binary

[21:12] <timo> yes, that is very funny

[22:33] <[Coke]> looks like no change with that commit

[22:33] <[Coke]> still dying going through moar!MVM_repr_bind_attr_inso

[22:34] <timo> that explosion comes from trying to bind an attribute on an object that doesn't have the capability to hold attributes

[22:34] <timo> i think we do that in some place with a "try" just to see if it would work?

[22:35] <[Coke]> launching with time travel, I get a popup that shows the recording command - options are "stop and debug" or "cancel"

[22:35] <[Coke]> I assume S&D is correct?

[22:36] <[Coke]> afk
