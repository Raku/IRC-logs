[14:20] <MasterDuke> so because the moarvm backend for nqp always uses nqp::serializetobuf, we never get past https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/6model/serialization.c#L930 and the base64 code is never called

[14:21] <MasterDuke> but i don't know if nqp/rakudo would ever want to use nqp::serialize

[14:21] <MasterDuke> so do we have to keep it, or can it be removed?

[14:22] <MasterDuke> jnthn, nine: ^^^?

[18:07] <jnthn> .tell MasterDuke it's likely that the original base64 path was left in there for bootstrap reasons (e.g. for a while both ways needed to work), and then removal later never happened

[18:07] <tellable6> jnthn, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[18:33] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/a5b4e2d6523dcb41a54e756ad7813bafd26262a2 is very relevant
