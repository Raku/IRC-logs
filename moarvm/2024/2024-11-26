[01:09] <MasterDuke> another interesting paper/idea https://inside.java/2024/11/22/mark-scavenge-gc/

[02:17] <timo> it would definitely be interesting to get a comparable measurement done with moar, but we don't have load barriers, so we have to use something less precise 

[02:18] <timo> alternatively, something based on instrumentation (like the valgrind toolkit) or emulation

[02:22] <timo> our GC is not "moving" the same way that the mentioned GCs do, i.e. we don't have something like regions that we try to evacuate by moving stuff around; when something moves to the old generation in moarvm, it stays in a fixed place
