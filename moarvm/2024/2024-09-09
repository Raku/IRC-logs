[00:07] <MasterDuke> developing on windows is just miserable

[00:07] <timo> if you fully buy into the microsoft ecosystem i'm sure it's not so bad

[00:07] <MasterDuke> could be. but i have no intention of doing that

[00:09] <MasterDuke> mimalloc is the only good piece of software i've ever seen come out of microsoft

[00:10] <timo> you've never seen Microsoft Bob?

[00:10] <timo> Encarta? the Magic School Bus educational games? those ruled

[00:11] <MasterDuke> but were those actually microsoft? or just purchased by them? age of empires is a great game, but wasn't actually *developed* by microsoft

[00:12] <MasterDuke> oddly enough they do make good hardware though. much better than their software

[00:16] <timo> ugh linker trouble
