[02:27] <MasterDuke> i'm open to the idea of making mimalloc non-optional. i think it builds more places than we do currently, and i don't believe there have been any moarvm/rakudo issues related to it

[02:28] <MasterDuke> timo: have you tested if any of the size-related functions are beneficial for e.g., array growth?
