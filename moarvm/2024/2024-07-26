[00:47] <MasterDuke> are those numbers for nfa improvements?

[01:17] <MasterDuke> there's definitely something going on with t/spec/S12-construction/destruction.t. running with --configure=0 may throw some red herrings in the mix, but it pretty regularly will fail with `Parse errors: Bad plan.  You planned 6 tests but ran 5.`

[01:37] <MasterDuke> hm. but valgrind doesn't report anything when that happens

[11:24] <timo> i got a small decrease in the maxresidentk from a change in the nfa memory stuff
