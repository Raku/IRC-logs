[10:22] <lizmat> I've just stumbled on some dead code in NQP for base64 decoding, and traced this back to MoarVM https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/src/6model/serialization.c#L157

[10:23] <lizmat> it has 2 TODOs there that might help in getting compilation faster

[10:24] <lizmat> but they're a bit out of my comfort zone at, but maybe up MasterDuke's ally, or maybe Nicholas ?

[10:24] <lizmat> and if the proposed opts don't help, remove the TODO  :-)

[10:31] <lizmat> in fact, I did one of the proposed opts in NQP before I realized I was looking at dead code

[10:31] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/fadc1af577b437f40ace1aae0eaff75f

[10:32] <lizmat> maybe that could be helpful for setting this up in MoarVM

[10:34] <lizmat> MAST creation is still about 15% of total compilation time

[13:36] <Voldenet> re base64 https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05109 https://github.com/WojciechMula/base64-avx512

[13:39] <Voldenet> I believe base64_encode/decode could be part of nqp ops

[15:01] <lizmat> yeah, I was thinking the same just now: since it *is* apparently used internally

[17:20] <japhb> What is it used *for*?

[17:20] <japhb> From context, I'm guessing MAST creation?  Anything else?

[21:18] <MasterDuke> .

[21:19] <MasterDuke> lizmat: there are fast base64 libraries available, e.g., https://github.com/powturbo/Turbo-Base64 and https://github.com/aklomp/base64, but how much time of the MAST stage is the base64 ops?

[22:14] <MasterDuke> huh. i just stuck a print in base64_(en|de)code and they didn't hit when building rakudo

[22:29] <MasterDuke> i was kind of interested in experimenting with those base64 libraries, but i'm not sure what it would help

[22:37] <japhb> Are you sure your version of MoarVM got used?

[22:51] <lizmat> MasterDuke: if it is not getting called, maybe it's dead code  :-)
