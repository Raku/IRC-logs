[16:13] <ab5tract> `#define REPR(o)          (STABLE((o))->REPR)`

[16:14] <ab5tract> is that a recursive macro?

[16:14] * ab5tract is trying to figure out how to incant it in the debugger

[16:17] * ab5tract realizes he can use `#define` in the debugger :)

[16:35] <nine> No, REPR is a normal field in the STable

[16:38] <nine> You can also get at it via o->st->REPR
