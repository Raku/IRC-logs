[10:21] <timo> whew, we really do have a boatload of stringified numbers in core setting's string heap ...

[11:24] <lizmat> timo: aren't values 0..255 special cased?  or are you talking about bigger numbers ?

[11:24] <lizmat> they could be nqp::const flag values ?

[12:06] <timo> nah, i think the numbers i'm seeing are all cuuids

[12:06] <timo> they go from the lowest numbers up to the tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands? not quite sure.

[12:08] <lizmat> but why as string ?

[12:09] <lizmat> ah, remember now: they're not always strings: I::Perl5 uses strings, if I remember correctly

[12:09] <lizmat> *integers

[12:13] <timo> could be

[12:14] <timo> for the medium future, we may want to look into storing stringified integers using less space

[12:15] <timo> but then we'd spend a little time on first access to the string for generating a stringified integer

[12:23] <timo> i wonder what we store a closure's name for. shouldn't it be the same as the static code object's?

[12:25] <lizmat> jnhtn might know :-)

[12:28] <timo> > String heap has 21966 only-digits strings for a total of 136132 bytes

[12:29] <timo> m: say 136132 * 100 / 0x86f50, " percent of bytes are for digits"; say 21966 * 100 / 38616, " percent of strings are digit-strings"

[12:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e95151b7: OUTPUT: «24.626617 percent of bytes are for digits␤56.883157 percent of strings are digit-strings␤»

[12:30] <timo> m: say "but that's only ", 136132 * 100 / 0x1bff5c0, " percent of the total file."

[12:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e95151b7: OUTPUT: «but that's only 0.46370427 percent of the total file.␤»

[16:55] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/10/21/2024-43-advent-alert/
