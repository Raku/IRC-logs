[20:04] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: patrickbkr++ created pull request #1859: Fix longjmp on Windows

[20:04] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1859

[20:05] <patrickb> timo: Can you have a look at this? ^

[23:17] *** sena_kun left
[23:39] <timo> i would say for now leave out changes to setjmp/longjmp on places where we don't have a jit, maybe even when we build without jit?

[23:39] <timo> and a comment in the source near where the magic happens would also be appreciated

[23:40] <timo> do you think we can build a check for the build system that can check if a longjmp through a jitted frame would explode with the default setjmp/longjmp? and maybe something that verifies that using setjmp/longjmp like this doesn't cause trouble due to changes on the windows side of things? not sure we're relying on something that is in any way guaranteed
