[10:10] <nine> Meanwhile I regularly build Rakudo on i586: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:languages:raku

[10:12] <nine> The Open Build Service btw. also includes local builds in VMs, containers and chroot environments. All also cross-distro.  It's just one command to do that.

[11:07] <timo> oh there is ppc64 there!

[11:08] <timo> [   61s] + %make_build NOISY=1

[11:08] <timo> [   61s] /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.qUirjQ: line 32: fg: no job control

[11:08] <timo> [   61s] error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.qUirjQ (%build)

[11:08] <timo> ..huh?

[11:37] <timo> podman run --arch ppc64 -it adelielinux/adelie:1.0-beta5 it could have been so easy this entire time haha

[11:37] <timo> but now i gotta run

[20:43] <timo> huh, i'm able to build nqp

[20:49] <timo> time for the core setting compilation

[20:53] <timo> Stage parse      : 235.312

[20:53] <timo> honestly, that could have been a lot worse

[21:02] <timo> timo@pebbsi:/var/home/timo/raku$ podman run --arch ppc64 -it localhost/rakudo_ppc64 /usr/bin/rakudo -e 'say "hello!"; say $*VM.config<osvers>'

[21:02] <timo> hello!
