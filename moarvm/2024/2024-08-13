[01:56] <timo> trying desperately to get my desktop out of its OOM thrashing (because somehow i just can *not* get the oom killer to react in a timely manner). trying to ssh in to "killall firefox" for example, but i'm always getting "connection reset by peer" after roughly 4 and a half minutes; something involved in the login process is running into a timeout. so i thought, what if i try ten times at the same

[01:56] <timo> time? maybe the stuff that's needed is pulled into ram "from front to back" and enough to let at least one connection go through? well, ten times isn't enough

[02:08] <timo> that just gets me a lot of "kex_exchange_identification: banner line 0: Exceeded MaxStartups" meh.

[02:23] <timo> well, i decided to use the power button

[08:44] <nine> timo: in the future, try alt+sysreq+f to invoke the OOM killer manually

[08:44] <nine> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key

[14:29] <timo> oh cool sysrq actually does work on my system

[14:30] <timo> just need to switch the "allow process kill related keyboard combinations" bit on

[14:41] <timo> i forgot that i was on a neo2 keyboard so pressing what i thought was "f" to test if the oom killer would trigger was actually pressing "o" for "power off"

[14:41] <timo> yes, i am very smart, thank you for asking.

[14:42] <lizmat> .oO( the ultimate OOM killer )

[15:36] <[Coke]> that'll do it!

[15:45] <timo> don't need to free up memory if i'll just rig my desktop with some C4 and blow it up every day when i'm done with work

[15:46] <lizmat> I guess that's one way to reduce power consumption  :-)

[15:47] <timo> to be fair, all CPUs are combustable
