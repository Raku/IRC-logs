[00:37] <MasterDuke> i've spent some time trying to get our mingw build to work and haven't succeeded yet. i haven't tried every suggestion i've come across, but i'm not terribly interested in spending any more time/effort on this. my vote is to remove it from CI and call it unsupported. if i don't hear any objections in the next couple days or nobody volunteers to try

[00:37] <MasterDuke> and get it working, i'll go ahead and do that later this week

[02:32] <ugexe> maybe ping whoever added it originally

[02:40] <MasterDuke> patrickb: ^^^

[06:31] <patrickb> Nah. I didn't add it. I just I lovingly improved our Windows story to a bearable level. I don't have strong emotions wrt MinGW support.
