[08:41] <Woodi> if memory is not shared (except lower subsystems like gc) then thread that own that objects can be put to sleep and things could be updated with parent pointer switching to copy ? or that thread need to do all coping and nothing else...

[08:42] <Woodi> atomic is wrong name transactions are needed. I read somewhere that all software is just database anyway :)  pity cpu's do not give that functionality
