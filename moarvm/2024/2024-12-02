[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Fix a compile warning on cl / Windows

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: The previous check was wrong, adding "-fwrapv" whenever you did not specify

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: "--os" on the command line. That option is unknown to `cl`. It seems `cl`

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: doesn't recognize "-d2UndefIntOverflow-" (nor some variants I have tried)

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: either. So the best we can do is just not adding any option of the like.

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[08:21] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: I do wonder if this has negative stability consequences.
