[03:34] <MasterDuke> timo, et al.: ubsan complains bitterly about loads and member accesses of misaligned addresses

[03:34] <MasterDuke> e.g., src/core/args.c:519:5: runtime error: load of misaligned address 0x755028adc807 for type 'MVMuint16', which requires 2 byte alignment

[03:35] <MasterDuke> src/disp/syscall.c:613:22: runtime error: load of misaligned address 0x755028cfd833 for type 'MVMuint16', which requires 2 byte alignment

[03:35] <MasterDuke> src/6model/reprs/P6int.c:93:54: runtime error: member access within misaligned address 0x057a7525afe4 for type 'struct MVMP6intBody', which requires 8 byte alignment

[03:36] <MasterDuke> is this really a problem? and if so, how should it be fixed?
