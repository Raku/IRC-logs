[17:22] <jdv> looks like a ci build failed due to a deprecated env

[17:24] <jdv> i'm cutting the release the old way as i don't know how to fix that and rerun it

[17:39] <jdv> anyone familiar with that stuff and can fix it?  https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1874

[17:40] * lizmat is hopIng for patrickb 

[17:41] <jdv> otherwise, this release is done.  going back to rakudo land.

[20:25] <timo> i seem to recall seeing warnings for a version of the macos runner that we have been using getting deprecated

[20:30] <jdv> yeah, i think that's the issue

[20:38] <timo> should be a matter of just a small string replacement in the azure-pipelines.yml i hope

[20:39] <timo> we didn't port any of the CI improvements from rakudo back to the moar repo right?

[20:51] <patrickb> it's a GitHub runner, not azure that's used for the release afail

[20:51] <patrickb> afaik

[20:53] <patrickb> still, just remove macos-12 here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_release.yml#L15

[20:53] <patrickb> I didn't do any portion of the CI stuff to nqp and moar.

[21:14] <patrickb> *porting
