[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: debugserver: prevent GC oops when stepping past a gc run

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: in order to refer to a frame as a collectable, it has to live in

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: the heap, it must not be on the callstack.

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Instead of making sure that we clean the step_mode_frame whenever

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: something happens to make it become invalid or anything complicated

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: like that, for now we just force the stack frame onto the heap,

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: which is not optimal from a performance standpoint, but safe.

[18:57] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f6d81f9915
