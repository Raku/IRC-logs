[00:54] <MasterDuke> maybe set_size_internal() should adjust the nursery?

[07:13] <nine> What do you mean by adjust the nursery?

[09:28] <timo> nine: when we create objects that have some amount of unmanaged memory to go with them, we also move the nursery limit back a little bit, so that the next GC comes sooner, because otherwise GC won't start by itself when memory runs low

[09:29] <timo> since an VMArray's object is so small, you could easily accidentally use up gigabytes of memory in unmanaged allocations with only a tiny fraction of the nursery used up

[09:32] <timo> of course you can still make an array that's a hundred gigabytes big with just one array, but the "adjust the nursery" is for the case when you have many many medium-sized objects, especially when they are short-lived, you need gc to step in earlier to ensure you don't run out

[09:55] <timo> spesh bug, spesh bug, what'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna do when it comes for you?

[09:59] <timo> doing the usual spesh osr disable, spesh inline disable, plus spesh blocking and maybe spesh bisect could be helpful
