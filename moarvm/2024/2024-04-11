[23:13] <MasterDuke> arg. i think the i have EDGE_SYNTH_CP_COUNT implemented for the jvm backend, but `+++ Compiling   gen/jvm/stage1/nqpmo.jar

[23:13] <MasterDuke> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling gen/jvm/stage1/nqpmo.nqp

[23:13] <MasterDuke> Unable to parse expression in blockoid; couldn't find final '}'  at NQP::src/how/Helpers.nqp:46, near "return nqp"`

[23:14] <MasterDuke> when the java part just crashed it was relatively straightforward to debug

[23:14] <MasterDuke> debugging this is less so
