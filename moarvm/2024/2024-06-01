[02:37] <ugexe> vmware (so maybe other vm software?) can set up a windows vm with just a click of a button

[02:37] <ugexe> you don't need a license key i dont think

[02:39] <ugexe> the vm software downloaded the iso and everything

[15:40] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: I could probably set it up for people to RDP to!

[15:40] <[Coke]> you around?

[16:07] <[Coke]> setup MasterDuke, if this works, happy to share (assuming hosting costs aren't insane. :)

[17:30] <coleman> [Coke] if you end up keeping that windows VM online, you can install an agent on there https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/windows

[19:40] <[Coke]> coleman: What do we have configured to use that agent?

[19:41] <[Coke]> i.e. what am I getting myself into? :)

[19:41] <coleman> nothing

[19:42] <coleman> or, i should clarify: no jobs will run on it by default

[19:43] <coleman> Here's an example config https://github.com/Raku/infra/blob/main/images/scripts/install_buildkite.sh#L46
