[23:27] <MasterDuke> nine: any idea what in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1802 could be causing the fail in t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t ? and what a fix could be?

[23:28] <MasterDuke> i wondered if a re-bootstrap would change anything, but no

[23:30] <MasterDuke> hm, i'm not sure what that test is doing. why is there a hardcoded value?

[23:34] <MasterDuke> oh, maybe the id is just forced to be that assuming the checksums are the same?

[23:43] <MasterDuke> also, anybody have any thoughts about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1802?
