[01:21] <ab5tract> Ironically enough (given how much crap autotools has been getting), this longjmp scenario is a perfect example of where autoconf comes in handy

[01:23] <ab5tract> timo: I think that the fallout from breaking QEMU would probably be just the tip of an iceberg if Windows were to remove this

[01:35] <timo> OTOH the qemu people surely have people who are sufficiently knowledgeable to deal with such a situation, and their user base is probably big enough that it would be noticed very quickly even in like preview builds of windows or something

[01:38] <ab5tract> It can stand in as a bellwether for sure

[01:40] <ab5tract> But also: if QEMU uses it, I bet there’s a significant pool of “dark code” that relies on it too, and MS is pretty consistent about backwards compat

[01:45] <timo> that's a soothing thought :)

[16:44] <[Coke]> non reproducible, but: https://gist.github.com/coke/20db0ddb89bc0d50675bac37654e0404

[16:44] <[Coke]> [0] >raku(26996,0x206e60f40) malloc: Heap corruption detected, free list is damaged at 0x6000020c0240

[16:44] <[Coke]> I had just installed Terminal::LineEditor, then ran raku to open the REPL and ran 'say 3'

[16:50] <lizmat> hmmm  could it be that Terminal::LineEditor needed to be re-precompiled ?

[16:51] <lizmat> and he the fact that it doesn't need to be any subsequent time, makes it unreproducible?

[16:52] <lizmat> fwiw, I suspect we still have some race conditions in the "module installed but needs to be re-precompiled" path

[17:16] <[Coke]> I did a zef info before I installed it, it wasn't there.

[17:16] <[Coke]> must have updated raku on this box at some point vaguely recently

[17:17] <lizmat> thing is that installing a module does NOT guarantee that it doesn't need to be re-precompiled for the $*REPO that you're working with

[17:17] <lizmat> the first time you use it, it will likely be re-precompiled again

[17:18] <lizmat> and I suspect we still have a bug inbetween saving the bytecode, and then running it

[17:36] <[Coke]> ah

[17:38] <lizmat> I wonder whether it is some premature optimization though: we just wrote the stuff from memory to the bytecode file, why not execute it from memory immediately as well

[17:38] <lizmat> and then have something gone awry just then
