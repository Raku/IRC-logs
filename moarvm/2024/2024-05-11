[06:47] <nine> MasterDuke: is that failure consistent?

[07:51] *** sena_kun joined
[12:35] <MasterDuke> nine: yep. happens every time. and every run the expected and got are different (both from each other and from previous runs)

[12:37] <MasterDuke> oh, different every run is expected

[19:34] <MasterDuke> i tried upping the count in the test all 9 ids are different. not really surprising since the first two are consistently different, but thought i'd check

[23:37] *** sena_kun left
