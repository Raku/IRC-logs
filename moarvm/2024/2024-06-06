[08:10] <Woodi> hi

[08:11] <Woodi> "Lexotic and dynamic control flow is implemented

[08:11] <Woodi> ...by a system of control exceptions"

[08:14] <Woodi> so looks like syntax thing. but control exceptions are implemented as unwinding so on implementation level looks the same thing like exceptions - eg. bad user data. but is it true ?

[08:16] <Woodi> I wonder what exceptions are... unwinding throws things away so like in surgery parts are cut off. so do exceptions collected "on the way" have material they want to work with ?

[08:18] <Woodi> phasers generating new exceptions... too complicated... maybe some simple "first exception wins" can save some debugging ?

[08:19] <Woodi> but as usual, no idea how things are implemented ;)

[08:36] <nine> Keep in mind that even warn throws a control exception

[08:59] <patrickb> Woodi: This looks like a reply to my mispaste above. See here for where that text actually ended up: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/417#issuecomment-2150925401

[09:03] <patrickb> woodi: Control exceptions are exceptions implementation wise. Not all exceptions initially unwind the stack. The "invokish" exceptions run a piece of code in the context of the thrower. The unwind happens afterwards (unless the code called `resume`).

[09:04] <patrickb> The opposite is a go-to exception. That just directly unwinds the stack and makes the interpreter continue at the specified point in the code (e.g. &return).

[09:54] <lizmat> or next or last

[09:54] <lizmat> or redo

[13:23] <Woodi> patrickb: re: Control exceptions are exceptions implementation wise  - that was point. but question was: do control exceptions are really exceptions ? maybe it's just implementation detail that can be implemented in other way ? becouse lexotics are control flow modifiers so looks like another category then exceptions...

[13:25] <Woodi> and rules like: "catch conflict controls, ..." looks strange and artificial... maybe becouse that are two different things ?

[13:27] <Woodi> patrickb: just ignore me if talking stupid things :)

[13:30] <Woodi> "control flow modifiers are different things then exceptions" - I know that exceptions are control flow elements too :)  but different then others

[13:30] <patrickb> Woodi: https://github.com/Raku/old-design-docs/blob/a4c36c683dafdad0bb55996e78b66a1f48fc703c/S04-control.pod might be a good read. You ask design questions, Those docs might give a lot of background on why things are the way they are

[13:31] <Woodi> but I already cited this :)
