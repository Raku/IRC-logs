[10:54] <nine> patrickb: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1782 seems to still counteract the consensus from the problem-solving ticket?

[10:55] <patrickb> nine: That PR is mostly unrelated to the problem-solving issue.

[10:57] <patrickb> That PR solves a problem where any &return irrelevant how deep down the call stack inside A LEAVE phaser will overwrite the return value of the &return that originally caused the stack unwind.

[11:01] <patrickb> The tests in  roast#851 actually depend on three PRs, the one you linked included.

[11:01] <linkable6> ROAST#851 [open]: https://github.com/Raku/roast/pull/851 Test return prioritization

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Revert "Don't lose return value with LEAVE phasers"

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: This reverts commit f8e7173226ce49f192fcd39f8dce1f63e1737f22.

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: 

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Way too close to the release, and just after a blin run.  Sorry.

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: Will re-apply after the 2024.05 release

[15:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM/main: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d67da80f39

[15:38] <lizmat> patrickb ^^

[15:50] <patrickb> nine: Thanks for taking the time to review my PRs! (I'll try to return the favor and also review a few PRs not authored by me.)

[15:52] <patrickb> lizmat: I'm curious if I / we manage to get those merged in 2024.06. :-)

[15:53] <lizmat> this one was approved by nine: that's good enough in my book (at the start of a release cycle)

[16:30] <nine> patrickb: sorry for the wrong delay. I'd have reviewed those earlier if I had realized that the whole thing is a bunch of somewhat independent issues
