[12:10] * brrt is many tired still :-(

[12:10] <brrt> has jnthn yet arrived?

[12:10] <nwc10> many tired, such yawn, zzzz

[12:10] <nwc10> ?

[12:10] <nwc10> I doubt it. I know that he was awake earlier.

[12:10] <lizmat> the jnthn is still en route

[12:10] <lizmat> afaik

[12:11] <nwc10> either that, or he's managed to make an IRC client that passes a turing test.

[12:12] <nwc10> I don't know where he's going *to* today (and I don't need to know that, nor does it need to be logged) but I know that he was setting off from *somewhere* 2 hours ago. So I'd guess that he's AFK

[13:37] <jnthn> .oO( after many relocation )

[13:43] <brrt> yes, that is true

[13:44] <jnthn> How goes things with the JIT hackery?

[13:45] <jnthn> Or is it more plannery at the moment for the tile thingy?

[13:46] <brrt> i've actually started reading in the book 'engineering a compiler'

[13:46] <brrt> which is an excellent book, by the way

[13:47] <brrt> .. that's another way to say, i'm not 100% sure yet what i'm doing, i guess

[13:54] <brrt> i think i have too many ideas to cut through

[14:09] <brrt> reading too much to make clear decisions is a known flaw of mine

[14:11] <jnthn> Yeah, it can be hard to strike a balance betwene informed decision-making and getting something done. :)

[14:11] <jnthn> Doing can often be very revealing, of course.

[14:14] *** vendethiel joined
[14:17] <brrt> :-) yes, i'm going to try and get something started tomorrow

[14:17] <brrt> after i've had a good nights sleep over it

[14:19] <brrt> see you!
