[09:24] <timotimo> a little profile of hello world on perl6-m shows it spends 6.4% in interp_run, 6.1% in reentrantmutex_lock, 4.3% in reentrantmutex_unlock

[09:24] <timotimo> 3.8% in string_utf8_decodeand 3.3% in serialization_read_ref

[09:26] <timotimo> well, a perf profile - meaning it's probabilistic

[09:26] <timotimo> but still ...

[09:26] <timotimo> curious result IMO

[09:29] <JimmyZ> I have a basic AA, but I don't know how to get it used :(

[09:30] <JimmyZ> the problem is that  I don't do AA between different ins and blocks

[09:30] <JimmyZ> *don't know how to do

[09:31] <timotimo> "differens ins"?

[09:31] <timotimo> anyway, i'll be AFK for a bit

[09:32] <JimmyZ> luajit is by chain

[09:32] <timotimo> maybe a little preprocessor would be interesting that creates C initializer literals or whatever for string constants that we decode from utf8 at run-time at some point

[16:51] <japhb> timotimo: Did your profile show where those heavy routines were being called *from*?

[16:55] <TimToady> I think they were being called from somewhere in Europe...

[17:04] <FROGGS_> >.<

[17:05] <FROGGS_> if it starts with 555 you know it is a fake

[17:21] <japhb> Well, mostly: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_%28telephone_number%29

[17:22] <japhb> It turns out that not all 555 numbers are fake.  I had to deal with that when I wrote a telecom billing system.  :-)

[17:27] <TimToady> gotta watch out for those fake fakes...

[17:29] <japhb> You would not believe the uproar if you misbill by even a penny -- and fake numbers are expected to be zero cost -- *even if the phone switch routes them somewhere successfully*

[17:32] <japhb> There are also weird cases like islands changing national identity, areas switching between national and international dialing, and more.  It's a deep rabbit hole if you want to get it right and not just punt the hard cases over to customer support ....

[17:36] <timotimo> japhb: perf has some trouble correctly getting the call graphs

[17:44] <japhb> timotimo: Ah, too bad.  Would be nice to know what's doing so much locking.  (It would be even nicer to know if that locking was contended.)
