[03:16] <diakopter> complete with type specialization

[04:50] <[Coke]> we'll need a moarvm tag when we're comfy.

[09:45] <timotimo> perl6 doesn't look so bad, does it?

[09:46] <brrt> no, it does not

[09:46] <timotimo> looking back, it really is quite a bit of good stuff all those people came up with

[09:46] <brrt> it's a really awesome language, yes

[09:47] <timotimo> and its runtime isn't half bad either

[09:53] <brrt> :-)

[09:53] <brrt> (aargh... libuv uses cfmakreaw on unix, which does not exist on solaris)

[10:38] <brrt> konobi: ^ the above doesn't work fully yet, because of libuv+cfmakeraw

[10:38] <brrt> also, libuv is currently at 1.7, and doesn't build with moarvm

[18:27] <timotimo> he's in the netherlands, so GMT+1 or so

[19:43] <timotimo> the pre-release-panic and hustling and stuff is quite palable :|

[19:43] <timotimo> we've cut the whole module installation and ecosystem stuff a bit close

[19:44] <timotimo> it's not like nine didn't ask for help. it's just nobody felt up to helping it seems

[19:44] <brrt> well....

[19:44] <brrt> i just hope no  jit bugs appear suddenly

[19:44] <timotimo> unlikely :)

[19:45] <timotimo> after the crazy jit bug with dynamic varibles, i'm sure we're not going to have anything crazy like that any more in the next months :P

[19:45] <brrt> well, more exposure is always risky

[19:45] <timotimo> and everything less crazy should easily be found

[19:45] <timotimo> sure

[19:45] *** sivoais joined
[19:46] <timotimo> ;)

[19:46] <brrt> yeah i'm kind of sorry for not helping nine++ out

[19:47] <timotimo> no, you are here for the jit :)

[19:48] <timotimo> i mean

[19:48] <timotimo> you can do whatever you like, but you're our one person on the road, when it comes to buses :S

[19:49] <brrt> i... would really like that to change

[19:50] <timotimo> as soon as the whole tiling business is implemented, everybody can come in and just use your fantastic work :D

[19:50] <brrt> besides you're not incomprtetent yourself

[19:51] <brrt> lets hope that...that'll  require some documentation effort too

[19:51] <timotimo> "incompetent" is a very, very hard target to hit :)

[19:52] <brrt> i disagree. i meet plenty such people. you are not one

[19:53] <konobi> brrt: howdy

[19:53] <konobi> you were having build woes?

[19:54] <brrt> not anymore..  or rather

[19:54] <brrt> is cfmakeraw implemented at all on solaris?

[19:55] <konobi> oh

[19:55] <konobi> I ran into that too

[19:55] <konobi> it's a libuv problem, iirc

[19:55] <brrt> and solved it how?

[19:55] <brrt> well yes

[19:55] *** sivoais joined
[19:56] <konobi> brrt: best ask in #illumos

[19:56] <brrt> but moarvm doesnt build with current libuv

[19:56] <konobi> it works for the libuv folks, but they must be using a different defines or the like

[19:56] <brrt> hence while i could patch libuv, that would not help moarvm

[19:56] <konobi> there was an illumos ticket about this before

[19:57] <brrt> probably yes

[19:57] <konobi> brrt: https://www.illumos.org/issues/1060

[19:58] <konobi> cfmakeraw is non-posix

[20:00] <brrt> but the thing builds now. i'd just rather not just include netbsd code haphazardly

[20:00] <brrt> well, i dont care. at all :-p

[20:01] <konobi> heh

[20:01] <brrt> check fix-illumos-build if you want

[20:04] <brrt> its clearly not a priority for #illumos

[20:04] <brrt> (the cfmakeraw bit)

[20:05] <konobi> oh... ./gyp_uv.py -f make

[20:05] <konobi> make -C out

[20:06] *** sivoais joined
[20:06] <konobi> seems to be how libuv wants to be built

[20:06] *** llfourn joined
[20:06] <brrt> i dont want gyp!

[20:07] <konobi> yeah, supposedly there's an autogen.sh route too

[20:07] <konobi> just wondering if those may be out of sync now

[20:07] <brrt> i dont really want any build system besides make

[20:07] <brrt> m

[20:07] <brrt> hmmm

[20:08] <brrt> i have to go lest my battery runs out

[20:09] <brrt> please check out the branch konobi
