[10:03] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[10:04] <nwc10> the minstry of truth has been at it again

[10:04] <nwc10> http://morepypy.blogspot.co.at/2015/10/automatic-simd-vectorization-support-in.html now reads The next release of PyPy,  "PyPy 4.0.0", ...

[10:04] <nwc10> when I looked at that page yesterday, the next release was going to be called 15.10

[10:05] <nwc10> anyway, good UGT, brrt

[10:07] <brrt> nwc10: you have to admit they are doing a wonderful job in getting publicity

[10:07] <brrt> i'm not sure if we want to replicate that, but on the other hand, they're probably getting a lot of interest

[10:30] <nwc10> brrt: I found it more interesting that they've skirted round the possible political problems of pypy 2.6.x being followed by 2.7.x and then, horror, 2.8.x

[10:30] <nwc10> 15.10 is not dangerous

[10:30] <nwc10> 4.0.0 is off in "Perl 7" land

[10:31] <brrt> 15.10 makes a lot more sense to me for a project that is 'tracking' another

[10:31] <nwc10> me too

[10:32] <brrt> same reason for moarvm, i presume

[10:32] <brrt> maybe they'll change it again. maybe they have strong opinions about it

[10:56] <FROGGS> the speedup pictures talk aber PyPy 15.11 and PyPy 2.6.1 ... I don't understand where that PyPy 4.0.0 is

[10:56] <FROGGS> so is 15.11 the same as 4.0.0?

[10:58] *** ShimmerFairy joined
[10:58] <brrt> supposedly, yes

[11:10] <tadzik> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[11:22] *** Ven joined
[11:26] <brrt> wow

[11:27] <brrt> a further design question. i'm so far that i can now automatically insert casts on mismatched operands

[11:27] <brrt> i can have operations that require signed casts, unsigned casts, and operations which forbid casts, which is actually most of them

[11:28] <brrt> should i add a type for stuff that should error out at compile time if a cast is tried?

[22:26] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Disable sp_fastcreate because it seems to be problematic,

[22:26] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: although I don't know why; fix scale check, and fix use
