[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM: 68c6716 | (Jimmy Zhuo)++ | src/ (4 files):

[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM: fixed sleep API to use second instead of nanosecond

[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM: perl6 -e 'sleep' costs ~5% cpu because sleep(1e16) never works in the rakudo source, since the sleep API uses nanosecond which causes 1e16 * 1e9 overflow.

[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:29] <dalek> MoarVM: this commit keeps the nanosleep API, and adds a new sleep API

[18:31] <dalek> MoarVM: Free jitcode->func_ptr before destroying jitcode

[18:31] <dalek> MoarVM:

[18:31] <dalek> MoarVM: Coverity showed the issue that the `func_ptr` field was still pointing to

[18:31] <dalek> MoarVM: memory when the `jitcode` variable was destroyed.  This change frees the

[18:31] <dalek> MoarVM: field before the enclosing variable is destroyed.

[20:50] <timotimo> yeah, a bit better

[20:58] <timotimo> those changelogs are going to be rewritten %)

[21:10] <dalek> MoarVM: 2d6b651 | timotimo++ | docs/ChangeLog:

[21:10] <dalek> MoarVM: rework the changelog a bit

[21:10] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2d6b651620

[21:11] <timotimo> does that look good?

[21:12] <timotimo> i'm starting to follow the release guide now

[21:13] <hoelzro> timotimo: is the ++ Many memory leaks fixed supposed to cover the -+ Many resource leak fixes ?

[21:13] <timotimo> i think so?

[21:13] <timotimo> we didn't have "resource" leaks, AFAIK

[21:13] <timotimo> we did have the file handles that weren't closed for async procs, but that has its own thing

[21:14] <hoelzro> ah, ok; I missed that

[21:14] <timotimo> i kind of wish i had done more cool stuff this month

[21:15] <timotimo> but i do that every single month :)

[21:20] <[Coke]> 1,031 tickets

[21:20] <[Coke]> ww.

[21:23] <timotimo> may want to switch those two tabs? :)

[21:25] <[Coke]> if I ever ww to moarvm, it's because it's the last thing I looked at.

[21:28] <timotimo> oke :)
