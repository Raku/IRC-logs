[06:18] <dalek> MoarVM: add some const to global static vars

[07:34] <jnthn> JimmyZ: that doesn't update the C files, and if you had, you'd have seen a bunch of warnings. That patch as it stands just creates warnings for somebody to have to clear up down the line, so I'm -1 to it.

[07:35] <brrt> \o

[07:35] <nwc10> o/

[07:37] <jnthn> o/

[07:44] <JimmyZ> jnthn: so it is fine if I clear the warnings?

[07:45] <JimmyZ> I just need UNIDATA/extracted/DerivedBidiClass.txt or somebody updates it ...

[07:47] <jnthn> JimmyZ: You just need to download the Unicode 7.0 database from the Unicode site; it's a ZIP file with all UNIDATA in.

[07:47] <jnthn> Assuming Unicode isn't bourgeoisie... :)

[07:53] *** Ven joined
[07:59] <JimmyZ> hmm, if I update it, it causes unicode_db.c a big change

[08:01] <jnthn> Sure it's not just line endings changes that go away on git add?

[08:01] <jnthn> It should only change the lines you changed.

[08:12] <JimmyZ> jnthn: turns out only one warning if somebody updates the C files.

[08:15] <JimmyZ> I download the zip, update the C files and cause many uneeded C file changes, maybe I downloaded a old one?

[08:15] <JimmyZ> it even cause many chnages to unicode_gen.h

[08:21] <jnthn> That sounds wrong...

[08:22] <jnthn> Can you do a fix for the warning? And I can do the update.

[08:22] <JimmyZ> yes, I can

[08:22] <JimmyZ> Thanks.

[08:22] <jnthn> I've been running that script lots lately anyway due to working on NF*

[08:23] <JimmyZ> I download it from  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.zip

[08:26] <dalek> MoarVM: ce0878e | (Jimmy Zhuo)++ | src/strings/unicode_ops.c:

[08:26] <dalek> MoarVM: fixed warnings

[08:26] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ce0878ef28

[08:26] <JimmyZ> jnthn: It is no hurry to update the C files.

[08:26] <JimmyZ> because I fixed the warnings. :P

[08:27] <jnthn> ok :)

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM: 2bad607 | FROGGS++ | src/ (2 files):

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM: don't lie about MVM_BOOL_MODE_UNBOX_STR_NOT_EMPTY (_OR_ZERO)

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM:

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM: Now MVM_BOOL_MODE_UNBOX_STR_NOT_EMPTY basically delegates to istrue_s

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM: and MVM_BOOL_MODE_UNBOX_STR_NOT_EMPTY_OR_ZERO considers "=" to be False.

[19:18] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2bad607b90

[19:19] <psch> tpyo :D

[19:20] <FROGGS> where?

[19:20] <psch> "="

[19:20] <FROGGS> damn

[19:21] <nwc10> oooh, OK, stage0 bump

[19:21] <FROGGS> yeah, had to :o(

[19:21] <nwc10> so, "this week" the new serialisation version will be 15?

[19:21] <nwc10> and we can toss the 13 code? :-)

[19:21] <FROGGS> you probably know more than me :o)

[19:22] <nwc10> slightly, but I'm not confident that I only guessed the right question and answer pairs when I was chatting with jnthn

[19:22] <nwc10> anyway, new stage0 is smaller

[20:03] <timotimo> that's very good

[20:15] <TimToady> wow, that nozzle is red hot

[20:18] <FROGGS> that's fun without context :o)

[20:28] <brrt> time for my weekly jit article dump: https://github.com/burningmime/curves/blob/master/RyuJITPerf.md

[20:28] <nwc10> o/

[20:28] <brrt> tl;dr - SIMD is really impressive

[20:28] <brrt> \o nwc10 :-)

[20:29] <FROGGS> yay! something to read!

[20:30] <brrt> :-)

[20:30] <brrt> hmm, i'm going to spoil it for you, but i think i have a theory why the above-normal fetching-and-storing for the SIMD doesn't mattter much, and it is pipelining

[20:34] <brrt> and rsp aliasing too
