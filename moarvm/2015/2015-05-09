[00:28] <japhb> ditto, but we will get there again

[00:29] <timotimo> i'm not making much progress with that :(

[08:11] <dalek> MoarVM/ignoremark: implement ordbaseat and eqatim_s for ignoremark

[08:11] <dalek> MoarVM/ignoremark: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/3ea7470c3b

[08:19] <dalek> MoarVM/ignoremark: e40b21c | FROGGS++ | src/core/interp.c:

[08:19] <dalek> MoarVM/ignoremark: chars are not equal beyond end of string

[08:21] <FROGGS> I'll gist my nqp changes in a bit, to prevent a stage0 update in case I did silly things

[08:33] <FROGGS> jnthn: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/1a0cb3448b7f014511d8 - it passes all tests from S05-modifier/ignoremark.t, though I probably need to implement ignorecase+ignoremark

[09:11] <tadzik> japhb: what's the problem?

[11:07] <jnthn> FROGGS: Seems reasonable.

[11:38] <FROGGS> jnthn: feel free to tweak the MVM_string_ord_basechar_at function :o)

[11:39] <jnthn> *nod*

[11:40] <FROGGS> so, my plan is to make ignorecase+ignoremark work, then pushing a stage0

[11:40] <FROGGS> ohh, and I have to think about jvm and parrot

[11:41] <nwc10> in the same way that we're thinking about NFG for parrot?

[11:41] <nwc10> and, for that matter, NFG for JVM?

[11:41] <nwc10> (different from parrot NFG, to be fractionally less obtuse)

[11:41] <FROGGS> and I had spotted an :mm modifier, and also have seen samemark tests (perhaps :mm is samemark)... ahh, and there we also sameaccent tests, I wonder if that is the same

[11:50] <FROGGS> hmpf, ranges in character classes also need to be handled to work under ignoremark

[11:51] <jnthn> urgh

[11:53] <FROGGS> which is a problem...

[11:53] <FROGGS> or... hmmm

[11:53] <FROGGS> dunno if I can translate that to bound checks

[12:15] *** FROGGS joined
[12:17] <FROGGS> I think I am going for an QAST::Regex subtype called 'ignorecase+ignoremark', and I really really hope that we do not have any other unimplemented modifiers of this kind

[12:20] <FROGGS> ahh, samecase and samemark seems to be for substitutions only...

[12:22] <FROGGS> so that "aBcDe".subst(/<[b..d]>/, 'xxx', :ii) might end up as "eXxXe"

[12:23] <FROGGS> TimToady: is that correct?

[12:25] <FROGGS> and "aöúe".subst(/\w+/, 'a', :mm) results in "aäáa"

[12:25] <FROGGS> (the ii example lacks a quantifier but besides that...)

[12:29] <FROGGS> jnthn: +1 to QAST::Regex subtype 'ignorecase+ignoremark ?

[12:32] <jnthn> FROGGS: I...hmm

[12:32] <jnthn> I don't have a beter idea.

[12:33] <FROGGS> beter... :P

[12:33] <FROGGS> that reminds me of weter.com

[12:34] <FROGGS> the funny thing is that this page is unmodified since at least 10 years

[14:51] <japhb> tadzik: The one where panda didn't know to treat .so/.dll specially, and people had to install them "by hand" for e.g. linenoise.  I just hadn't noticed whether that was already done, or still NYI.

[14:53] <tadzik> let me see

[14:53] <tadzik> I wasn't aware ofit

[14:53] <tadzik> yep, it's broken

[14:53] <tadzik> and now my perl6 is broken

[14:53] <tadzik> fuck

[14:53] <tadzik> but it does Copying blib/lib/liblinenoise.so to /home/tadzik/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6/site/lib/liblinenoise.so

[14:53] <tadzik> so is that place wrong?

[14:55] <japhb> tadzik: I wonder if there is something that needs to be done so the dlopen (or Windows equivalent) can find it.  The collective memory of #perl6 might know it.

[14:55] <japhb> (Or if what really needs to be fixed is NativeCall ...)

[14:55] <tadzik> right now I don't know how to make it work on linux either :)

[14:59] <japhb> Come to think of it (from the outside), I would think it's the local install and NativeCall library lookup code paths that probably need thought.  Whether panda has to be directly involved in that, I dunno.

[15:00] <lizmat> fwiw, we had a temporary solution for that in CURLI

[15:00] <lizmat> but the migration of @*INC to strings broke that

[15:00] <japhb> (It occurs to me that everyone had been referring to it as a "panda v. DLL" problem, but it's not actually a foregone conclusion that it's panda's problem beyond just getting the DLL to the proper install directory for that particular auth/version of the module.)

[15:01] <lizmat> I hope to have time again tomorrow to look at this

[15:01] <japhb> lizmat: Ah, gotcha.

[15:01] <tadzik> is there a reson why we shouldn't put site/lib in nativecall's search path?

[15:01] <tadzik> and/or: why isn't it there already :)

[15:01] <tadzik> oh, versioning..

[15:02] <japhb> Yeah

[15:02] <tadzik> so CUR needs to deal with .so (does it already?) and NativeCall has to be aware of it

[15:02] <lizmat> CURLI does, but CURLI doesn't work with panda

[15:02] <lizmat> :-(

[15:03] <lizmat> at least, it didn't for me...  :-(

[15:04] <tadzik> is it panda's fault?

[15:08] <lizmat> well, fault is a big word

[15:08] <lizmat> it is at least incompatible atm

[15:10] <tadzik> hm

[15:45] <TimToady> FROGGS: re http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2015-05-09#i_10575280 I think that would merely result in 'a'.  You'd have to replace with aaaa to get the result you postulated

[15:46] <TimToady> or just use \w and :g

[20:23] <jnthn> lizmat: Didn't see you at all :( Such is my eyesight

[20:24] <lizmat> you were in a deep discussion, so even with good eyesight, you would not have seen us :-)

[20:24] <jnthn> ah :)

[20:24] <lizmat> we were inside, you were outside passing

[20:25] <jnthn> Ah, in l'irish pub?

[20:27] <lizmat> yup

[20:28] <jnthn> I'd totally join if I didn't have to finish this tutorial :)

[20:28] <lizmat> we were just in back from "Taste Of China"

[20:28] <jnthn> Also I should rest my voice given I have to talk for 4 hours tomorrow. :)

[20:28] <lizmat> I completely understand... I was just teasing  :-)

[20:29] <jnthn> Figured :-)

[20:29] <jnthn> Well, tomorrow the talks are finished and I can relax with a beer :)
