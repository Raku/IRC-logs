[00:57] <timotimo> that seems like a usable example

[01:00] <timotimo> recvfrom ought to allow for supplying an address to receive from, or not supplying an address and filling the buffer with the address that was actually received from, or to not set an address because the udp socket has been "connected"

[01:20] <timotimo> locking a UDP socket for reading/writing doesn't make much sense, right?

[01:20] <timotimo> er for receiving/sending

[01:29] <jnthn> timotimo: Probably, but note locking happens up in io.c iirc

[01:32] <timotimo> ah, the mutex is in the MVMOSHandle's body

[01:32] <timotimo> that explains why i got confused

[20:15] <brrt> timotimo++ for working on moarvm udp capability

[20:15] <brrt> udp is awesome

[20:15] <brrt> or: 'udp is sometimes a very nice tool for solving problems with networks'

[20:18] <timotimo> can you tell if the design is sensible or problematic?

[20:18] <timotimo> (apart from crashing all of the spec tests related to async stuff)

[20:22] <brrt> not yet, i haven't really seen all you're trying to do

[20:23] <brrt> btw, we can remove the moar-jit branch, can't we?

[20:24] <brrt> ok, i think i can comment

[20:24] <timotimo> sure, we can

[20:26] <brrt> ok, first things first

[20:27] <brrt> as i understand UDP, it doesn't make that much of a difference if you use it in synchronous mode versus asynchronous mode

[20:27] <brrt> in neither case is delivery guaranteed

[20:27] <brrt> i think synchronous mode just waits until the buffer is sent, but i'm not even sure of that

[20:27] <timotimo> well, for receiving the API difference is the main point

[20:28] <brrt> fair point

[20:28] <timotimo> you may not want the round trip through the extra thread that has the event loop

[20:28] <brrt> but personally i'd call that - excuse the bikeshedding :-) - blocking receiving vs nonblocking receiving

[20:28] <timotimo> and at some point we'll possibly do our IO without libuv

[20:28] <timotimo> that's ... exactly what we mean by async vs sync I/O ...

[20:28] <timotimo> hm ... well, not completely

[20:28] <brrt> fair enough :-)

[20:29] <brrt> anyway, it's bikeshedding and not important

[20:29] <brrt> my real question is

[20:29] <brrt> why is the message an MVMArray

[20:29] <brrt> rather than an MVMString

[20:29] <timotimo> MVMStrings are encoded

[20:30] <timotimo> do MVMStrings allow null bytes?

[20:30] <FROGGS> brrt: a buffer in P6 is an MVMArray

[20:30] <FROGGS> a blob8 for example

[20:30] <timotimo> aye

[20:30] <brrt> ok, i see

[20:30] <timotimo> the perl6-level api may allow Str to be passed and automatically encoded

[20:31] <brrt> i was under the impression that MVMString was  the underlying buffer type

[20:31] <FROGGS> no

[20:32] <brrt> looks sensible enough to me, really

[20:33] <timotimo> now i have to actually implement it :(

[20:34] <FROGGS> :P

[20:41] <jnthn> Sucks when you actually have to turn nice ideas into working code, dammit. :)

[20:42] <FROGGS> jnthn: I know this is not #jvm... but is the outer of a CU potentially the setting?

[20:43] <jnthn> Outer of a...CU?

[20:43] <jnthn> CUs don't have outers

[20:43] <jnthn> The outer of the unit scope of a program or module is the setting

[20:44] <jnthn> So yes, you reach the setting lexicals through .outer

[20:44] <FROGGS> ahh yes, that's what I meant

[20:45] <FROGGS> so, for the jvm/uri bug the problematic callframe does not reach the setting

[20:45] <FROGGS> and the outers it has do not appear elsewhere in my dump

[20:46] <FROGGS> so, now I need to check how the outers are set up when DefaultPort.pm gets precompiled

[20:46] <FROGGS> (and how these are then deserialized)

[20:46] <jnthn> Yeah...is the code in question in a role?

[20:46] *** donaldh joined
[20:46] <FROGGS> no

[20:47] <jnthn> Hm, ok

[20:48] <FROGGS> that's the code: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/1401a5ed729089a6aa17

[20:48] <FROGGS> and that's the result:

[20:48] <FROGGS> Can not invoke object '&postcircumfix:<{ }>'

[20:48] <FROGGS> in sub scheme_port at lib/URI/DefaultPort.pm:30

[20:48] <FROGGS> in method default_port at lib/URI.pm:5

[20:49] <FROGGS> so, it is a quite short bit of code

[20:53] <FROGGS> I guess.... since it is a problem with precomp only there must be an issue while serializing or deserializing

[20:55] <FROGGS> ummm, how does that happen for the jvm?

[20:56] <jnthn> Not too different from on moar

[20:56] <jnthn> There's an implementation of serialization/deserialization, written in Java.

[20:57] <FROGGS> ahh, I was looking at runtime/CallFrame.java, not repr/*

[20:58] <FROGGS> and curFrame.codeRef.name is quite helpful :o)

[21:00] <FROGGS> ohh wait... the other call frames here it can find &postcircumfix:<{ }> are called <unit>... and of course, it gets exported into our <unit> namespace, right?

[21:01] <FROGGS> and for the case where it cant find &postcircumfix:<{ }>, it hits its <unit> but misses the symbol

[21:04] <timotimo> well, i'm glad to hear the UDP code sounds like a good idea to you

[21:06] <lizmat> and the idea is that an UDP listening socket is a Supply that can be tapped ?

[21:07] <jnthn> lizmat: Presumably that's the async impl, yes

[21:09] <FROGGS> ahh... when I load DefaultPort.pm directly it works and the symbol is found in the fourth outer

[21:09] <FROGGS> when I load it via URI.pm the outer chain breaks after the second outer

[21:09] <timotimo> yup

[22:35] <timotimo> res_buf->body.slots.i8 = (MVMint8 *)buf->base;

[22:35] <timotimo> it would seem like alloc_init for MVMArray would have the body->slots already malloc'd to something?

[22:45] <timotimo> oh, actually

[22:45] <timotimo> recvfrom should receive an already existing buffer for the address (though not necessarily a filled one)

[22:46] <timotimo> and sendto should either get passed an address or not get an address at all, as in VMNull

[22:46] <timotimo> but a type object for the message that gets received would stlil be necessary, i believe

[23:32] <timotimo> oh

[23:32] <timotimo> i only had to "make" in order to make it work ...

[23:32] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, part of the type, yes

[23:33] <timotimo> timo@schmetterling ~/p/rakudo (nom)> perl6 -e 'say nqp::resolvehostname("perl6.org", 0x80, buf8.new)'

[23:33] <timotimo> Buf[uint8]:0x<02 00 00 80 d5 5f 52 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>

[23:33] <timotimo> timo@schmetterling ~/p/rakudo (nom)> perl6 -e 'say nqp::resolvehostname("google.com", 0x80, buf8.new)'

[23:33] <timotimo> Buf[uint8]:0x<02 00 00 80 ad c2 71 82 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>

[23:33] <timotimo> 2 is the INET type, i believe

[23:33] <timotimo> 80 is the port, after that seems to just be the ip address (but why all the null bytes? who knows.)

[23:35] <FROGGS> timotimo: you can store your sekrit password there :o)

[23:35] <timotimo> :3

[23:35] <FROGGS> the port number wont be a single byte fwiw

[23:36] <FROGGS> or are you talking about the trailing bytes?

[23:37] <timotimo> jnthn: why do we free the host_cstr but not the port_cstr?

[23:37] <timotimo> oh

[23:37] <timotimo> because that's on the stack

[23:38] <FROGGS> gnight

[23:38] <timotimo> aaw

[23:38] <timotimo> no more froggs today

[23:44] <dalek> MoarVM/udp_sockets: 8d4a26a | timotimo++ | src/io/syncsocket.c:

[23:44] <dalek> MoarVM/udp_sockets: a bit of cleanup

[23:44] <dalek> MoarVM/udp_sockets: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8d4a26a96e

[23:45] * jnthn is le tired

[23:45] <timotimo> anything cool i can look forward to for tomorrow? :)

[23:46] <jnthn> Dunno. I've a course to finish up writing.

[23:46] <jnthn> So depends how well that goes tomorrow :)

[23:47] <timotimo> OK

[23:47] <timotimo> good luck!

[23:47] <timotimo> and have a good rest :)
