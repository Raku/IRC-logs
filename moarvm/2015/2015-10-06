[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: 41d75f1 | jnthn++ | src/strings/utf8.c:

[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix indento.

[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/41d75f1a8e

[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: f09c782 | jnthn++ | src/strings/ (3 files):

[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: Strip UTF-8 BOM when decoding.

[10:50] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f09c7826a6

[10:54] <nwc10> jnthn: error in

[10:54] <nwc10> static MVMint32 its_the_bom(const char *utf8) {

[10:54] <nwc10> needs to be unsigned char

[10:54] <jnthn> error?

[10:54] <nwc10> IIRC, and from inspection

[10:55] <nwc10> it's a bug

[10:55] <nwc10> uns_utf8[0] == 0xEF && uns_utf8[1] == 0xBB && uns_utf8[2] == 0xBF

[10:55] <jnthn> In *both* cases, the things we pass to it are char *

[10:55] <nwc10> will not be true if char is signed

[10:55] <jnthn> Uh

[10:55] <nwc10> cannot be true if char is signed

[10:55] <jnthn> You missed a line

[10:55] <nwc10> that's more what I meant

[10:55] <nwc10> oh

[10:55] <nwc10> you are corerct

[10:55] <nwc10> I missed a line

[10:56] <jnthn> phew :)

[10:56] <nwc10> in which case, sorry

[10:56] <jnthn> np

[10:57] <jnthn> Would much rather than code review with occasional false positives than no code review. :)

[10:57] <jnthn> s:1st/than/have/

[10:59] <nwc10> I'm twitchy because it look me a long time previously to find that bug

[10:59] <nwc10> code had that bug in it, so the BOM-ness never triggered

[10:59] <nwc10> until I built on ARM

[10:59] <nwc10> obviously the code wasn't *meant* to trigger

[10:59] <nwc10> but the bug had been concealed

[11:00] <jnthn> urgh

[11:00] <jnthn> Yeah

[11:01] <nwc10> I'm suspicious that I shouldn't have any more coffee today

[11:04] * jnthn only had the one today

[11:05] <nwc10> but it was a pint?

[11:05] <jnthn> Normalish size cup :)

[11:06] <masak> but it was a double espresso?

[11:06] <jnthn> Well, it had that much worth of coffee in, I suspect :)

[11:06] <nwc10> the Internet fails me. I can't find an image of a Maß filled with coffee

[11:06] <nwc10> (or perhaps, more visually approrpiately, cappochino)

[11:07] <jnthn> hah...that has to be done!

[11:07] <nwc10> I am thinking this too

[11:07] <jnthn> Would be such a fitting image for hacktoberfest

[11:07] *** travis-ci joined
[11:07] <travis-ci> MoarVM build errored. jnthn 'Strip UTF-8 BOM when decoding.'

[11:07] <travis-ci> https://travis-ci.org/MoarVM/MoarVM/builds/83865609 https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/5075f5b1a59e...f09c7826a6ce

[11:07] *** travis-ci left
[11:08] <jnthn> Oh?

[11:08] <jnthn> ah

[11:08] <nwc10> I don't have a Maß, and I don't know anyone from whom I could blag a loan.

[11:08] <jnthn> The command "sudo apt-get update -qq" failed and exited with 100 during .

[11:08] <jnthn> Pretty sure that's not my fault :)

[11:10] <nwc10> also, mmm, going to be hard to make a drinkable cappuccino in a heavy glass without either breaking the glass, or having coffee that is lukewarm at best, and cold soon after

[11:10] <nwc10> and not sure if any microwave I have access to is large enough to pre-warm the glass to avoid this

[11:11] <nwc10> but these things can be worked round, if a glass can be procured

[11:11] *** Ven joined
[11:13] <jnthn> I suspect putting warm water into the glass first to warm it would help

[11:13] <nwc10> I was thinking exactly that. And incrementally raising the temperature of the water

[12:20] *** domidumont joined
[12:22] <domidumont> Hello. To optimize rakudo debian packages, I need to know if the moar files produced when building rakudo are the same whatever the architecture (i.e amd64, or arm ...) ? Can anyone confirm ?

[12:22] <nwc10> they are identical

[12:22] <nwc10> (or it's a bug)

[12:22] <nwc10> they have to be - NQP bootstraps using a copy of the file from git

[12:23] <nwc10> which is the same file on all architectures

[12:23] <domidumont> nwc10: ok. thanks. Then I'll need to split rakudo package on Debian: one for the shared lib and one for all other files

[12:46] <jnthn> Yes, .moarvm files are architecture-independent

[12:46] <jnthn> And architecture-unoptimized

[13:18] <nwc10> domidumont: would that be easier if Makefiles had 2 install targets? For architecture independent things, and arhcietecture dependent things? (and the ability to configure them to point to different places, keeping the defaults as they currently are?)

[13:22] *** Ven joined
[13:29] <domidumont> nwc10: 2 install targets: no. because the whole package is built at once and files are then picked to be moved in one or another package

[13:30] <nwc10> aha right. thanks for that clarification

[13:30] <domidumont> nwc10: on the other hand, rakudo lacks the ability to specify where to install the shared lib (I had to patch Makefile-moar.in)

[13:30] <domidumont> nwc10: so the configuration parameter would help

[13:31] <domidumont> On a unix system, a shared lib (a .so file) should never land in /usr/share

[19:58] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[20:02] <brrt> re: the coffee discussion, why not preheat the glass in an oven?

[20:02] <brrt> can be as slow as you like

[20:02] <brrt> easy to do, too

[20:02] <brrt> (heating water to heat a porcelain or glass cup is about as inefficient as can be due to water's huge heat coefficient)

[20:06] <lizmat> brrt: it was more about not cooling down so fast

[20:06] <brrt> well, then a thick glass should do the trick, shouldn't it?

[20:09] <brrt> although you have these ehm, 'vacuum' hole glasses nowadays

[20:09] <brrt> those are better still
