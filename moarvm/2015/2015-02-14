[07:24] <nwc10> jnthn: I think that your MoarVM merged has broken rakudo nom (SEGV during the build) but I'm not exactly sure what/why/where

[07:24] <nwc10> rebuilding origin/native-ref to be confident that that *does* work

[07:25] <nwc10> but going to run out of time to get further on the rest

[07:25] <FROGGS_> morning

[07:26] <FROGGS_> jnthn: is nativectype, is ctypesize..., is ctype something like that?

[07:28] <FROGGS_> jnthn: btw, nativecall works on 32bit freebsd as well :o) (I'll test it on windows later)

[07:29] <FROGGS_> I'll be afk most of the day though

[07:29] <FROGGS_> nwc10: I'm testing it now too

[08:19] <FROGGS_> make: *** [blib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP.moarvm] Speicherzugriffsfehler (Speicherauszug erstellt)

[08:20] <FROGGS_> that's with master(nom)/HEAD of everything

[08:25] *** Ven joined
[08:44] <jnthn> Gah, I musta messed up switching branch when testing.

[08:44] <TimToady> works okay on nom/master/master here

[08:45] <jnthn> Oh?

[08:45] <TimToady> I did a reconfig though

[08:45] <jnthn> I'm...surprised, now I see what's wrong.

[08:49] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[08:50] <FROGGS[mobile]> TimToady: you are probably not on MoarVM HEAD

[08:53] <TimToady> my config.status says: /usr/bin/perl Configure.pl "--backends=ALL" "--gen-parrot" "--gen-moar=master" "--gen-nqp=master" $*

[08:53] <jnthn> Hopefully all fixed :)

[08:57] <FROGGS[mobile]> others have to test it, I should not stress my laptop battery, I am on call :o/

[17:24] <FROGGS> I think I'll add a 'is nativectype' trait... then port All The Things™ to parrot and jvm and then move NativeCall to rakudo

[17:25] <FROGGS> I'll do the latter at this point because again we need a very recent rakudo with latest NativeCal

[17:25] <FROGGS> +l

[17:47] <moritz> +1

[17:47] <FROGGS[mobile]> :o)

[17:50] <TimToady> +ב

[17:53] <TimToady> +ﾕ

[18:04] <FROGGS> .u ﾕ

[18:05] <FROGGS> m: say uniname 'ﾕ'

[18:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 949b80: OUTPUT«HALFWIDTH KATAKANA LETTER YU␤»

[18:07] <TimToady> ﾕ and only ﾕ can prevent forest fires

[18:08] <TimToady> though really they'd write that ユー

[18:09] <TimToady> because English diphthongs are longer than one Japanese mora

[18:10] <TimToady> oh wait, this is #moarvm, must not discuss linguistics here... :)

[18:11] <FROGGS> I don't understand most of it anyway :o)
