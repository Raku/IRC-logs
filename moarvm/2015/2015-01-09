[09:21] <JimmyZ> morning, jnthn

[09:22] <JimmyZ> jnthn: https://gist.github.com/zhuomingliang/78fa5660ad16d2d5a890  is it right? added 3 MVM_ASSIGN_REF

[09:24] <jnthn> Certainly ot.

[09:24] <jnthn> *not

[09:24] <jnthn> Well, the first one you added is obviously wrong

[09:25] <jnthn> Just by looking at the pointer type.

[09:25] <JimmyZ> oh, yes

[09:25] <jnthn> MVMObject ** is not a GC-able thing, it's a C array of GC-able things.

[09:25] <jnthn> And I'm not sure the extra whitespace is warranted.

[09:25] <JimmyZ> and how about the other two?

[09:26] *** kjs_ joined
[09:26] <jnthn> The lifting of the STABLE(obj) is OK, though, but elsewhere in the code we normally just call such vars "st"

[09:27] <jnthn> Second one is certainly wrong too

[09:27] <jnthn> MVMFrame * is *not* a GC-able thing either.

[09:27] <jnthn> The static_info one is correct, however.

[09:28] <jnthn> Though note the cast to MVMObject* could go away in favor of something more like sf->common.header

[09:28] <JimmyZ> oh, it's MVMStaticFrame!

[09:29] <jnthn> Yes, MVMStaticFrame is an MVMObject.

[09:29] <jnthn> But MVMFrame is not.

[09:29] <JimmyZ> yeah

[09:29] <jnthn> So anyway, only one out of three of these should be added. :)

[09:30] <JimmyZ> I still don't  why sf->common.header is better?

[09:30] <jnthn> Because it avoids a cast.

[09:31] <JimmyZ> jnthn: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2015-01-01  I added some explaintion

[09:35] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm still uncomfortable with the idea. I think partly because it makes termination harder to reason about...

[09:39] <JimmyZ> but call something like optimize_set etc is not good too :(

[09:40] <JimmyZ> everywhere...

[09:41] <jnthn> I'm not sure we should be doing that.

[10:07] <dalek> MoarVM: 5149e5d | (Jimmy Zhuo)++ | src/core/interp.c:

[10:07] <dalek> MoarVM: small refactor, and add a missing MVM_ASSIGN_REF

[10:07] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/5149e5d681

[10:09] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Oh, that patch does something bad.

[10:10] <jnthn> You can't lift the dereferences of obj and ctx above the things thta check for type and concreteness.

[10:10] <jnthn> Otherwise we can get segfaults.

[10:11] <jnthn> (that's in the forceouterctx bit)

[10:13] <JimmyZ> hmm, I did make spectest, maybe we have not test to cover it

[10:15] <JimmyZ> you mean ((MVMCode *)obj)->body.outer = context; ?   I tought it's safe if there were eqv

[10:16] <JimmyZ> *thought

[10:16] <jnthn> No

[10:16] <jnthn> MVMFrame *orig     = ((MVMCode *)obj)->body.outer;

[10:17] <jnthn> That

[10:17] <jnthn> You can't deref obj until *AFTER* if (REPR(obj)->ID != MVM_REPR_ID_MVMCode || !IS_CONCRETE(obj)) {

[10:17] <jnthn> Otherwise heck knows what memory you're going to be trying to access.

[10:17] <JimmyZ> ah, I didn't seee it ..

[10:17] <jnthn> You've fixed one bug and introduced 2 new ones :/

[10:17] <jnthn> We were better off before.

[10:18] <JimmyZ> 2 ?

[10:19] <jnthn> Well, 3 if we're going to count all 3 memory accesses you lifted above the if statements :P

[10:19] <JimmyZ> yeah

[10:20] <nwc10> hat trick!

[10:21] <jnthn> Anyway, please be careful when re-ordering things. It's nice when we can get things intialized at their point of declaration, and certainly I structure code that way when it's possible, but often correctness doesn't allow it.

[10:23] <dalek> MoarVM: a112b47 | (Jimmy Zhuo)++ | src/core/interp.c:

[10:23] <dalek> MoarVM: fix potential segfault

[10:23] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/a112b47896

[10:23] <jnthn> Looks better. JimmyZ++

[10:26] <JimmyZ> Thanks

[10:29] <FROGGS_> jnthn: when do you think you'll have some time to review and discuss a moarvm branch?

[10:29] <jnthn> FROGGS_: Next week.

[10:29] <FROGGS_> jnthn: will perhaps take 15 to 30 minutes in total I guess

[10:30] <jnthn> (Will have time on Mon or Tue.)

[10:30] <FROGGS_> jnthn: what's your timezone offset these days?

[10:30] <jnthn> Yours + 1.

[10:30] <FROGGS_> ahh, that's quite nice :o)

[10:31] <jnthn> Yeah, and back to same as you from Mon :)

[10:31] <jnthn> Well, very late Sun, but I'll probably only be useful for sleeping by then :)

[10:31] <FROGGS_> :o)

[10:32] <FROGGS_> okay, then I'll ping you monday afternoon/evening... it is about IO/open/separators

[10:33] <jnthn> OK :)

[10:44] <jnthn> Gone for most of day &

[12:01] * FROGGS_ .oO( enjoying the Most of the day )

[20:20] <jnthn> FROGGS__: That comment was a bridge too far... :P

[20:28] <FROGGS__> but I'd do it again :o)

[20:55] <TimToady> this is going to be the longest day...

[20:56] <jnthn> Gee, the shortest was only a few weeks ago...

[20:56] * lizmat wonders how she can sneak in "battle of the bulge" in this conversation

[20:57] <TimToady> Nuts!

[20:57] <lizmat> hmmm.... the order is wrong: first the longest day, then a bridge too far, then the battle of the bulge

[21:00] <TimToady> some company probably holds a patton on the correct order

[21:01] <jnthn> That sounds overly general...

[21:02] <TimToady> I thought that was, like, Ike...
