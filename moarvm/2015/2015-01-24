[10:51] * FROGGS is finally writing slides

[10:53] <jnthn> You're ahead of me...

[10:53] * jnthn has a flight tomorrow and hopes to use the time to start preparing his talk

[10:55] <nwc10> so a different set of delay excuses from the usual? :-/

[10:56] <jnthn> Well, the weather's pretty fine on each end, and SAS - though they pad their flight times - usually don't do too bad on delays.

[10:57] <jnthn> Of course, the train to the airport can get delayed...

[11:09] <tadzik> oh, slides :)

[11:19] <rurban_> jnthn: Is your miniparrot SEGV on 32bit or 64?

[11:19] <jnthn> 64-bit

[11:20] <rurban_> Oh, that's why. I'll check asap

[11:22] <jnthn> I did a 6_10_0 build some days back and that worked out fine, fwiw

[11:42] *** FROGGS[mobile]2 joined
[12:04] <rurban_> yes, it's a regression.
