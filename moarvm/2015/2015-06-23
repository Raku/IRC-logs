[06:57] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: is it possible that moarvm@kfreebsd lacks the dependency on libkvm?

[06:59] *** zakharyas joined
[07:03] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: maybe

[07:03] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: the dependency are really lite

[07:05] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: bingo https://paste.debian.net/255187/

[07:06] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: can you adjust that for the 2015-06 release?

[07:06] <nebuchadnezzar> sure

[07:06] <FROGGS> it is the only dependency where have there I believe

[07:07] <FROGGS> we also need librt and libdl, but that's standard, right?

[07:07] <FROGGS> I mean, it is a dependency on linux too, and it works on linux

[07:07] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: if not it would have failed on other arches

[07:08] <FROGGS> yeah, I think so too

[07:09] <FROGGS> Build-Depends should probably contain libkvm-dev then

[07:11] <FROGGS> ahh, it is libkvm0

[07:11] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: not a problem, I do not have access to my SSH keys from work, so I can't do it now

[07:12] <FROGGS> yes, sure

[07:12] <FROGGS> but the packages are called: libkavm0 and libkvm-dev

[07:13] <FROGGS> I always struggle to find the right packages

[07:13] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: Build-Depends on libkvm-dev I think https://packages.debian.org/unstable/libkvm-dev

[07:13] <FROGGS> aye

[07:24] <nebuchadnezzar> thanks a lot, I'm planning to setup a kfreebsd VM on my OpenNebula to test before pushing it

[07:33] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: is it easy to set up a debian package build bot?

[07:59] *** brrt joined
[08:00] <brrt> so far, it works

[08:01] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: I'll just install a VM, clone and dpkg-buildpackage ;-)

[08:12] <brrt> ok, bugfix, but many success

[08:13] <brrt> https://github.com/MoarVM/dynasm/tree/dasm-fix <- can now use full GPR addressing on x64

[08:14] <brrt> that tree is not suitable for merging with luajit, by the way

[09:02] <brrt> good morning

[09:02] <brrt> on the road already, or still in sweden?

[09:02] <JimmyZ> it still is nice we choose DynASM :P

[09:03] <masak> brrt++ # nananananananananananananananana dynasm!

[09:03] <brrt> hey, there may still be bugs though :-)

[09:04] <brrt> yes, actually, the alternative would've been knowing *every* bit of x86 instruction encoding, and now i only need to know 80% or so :-P

[09:04] <brrt> that's an overstatement too

[09:07] <jnthn> brrt: Still in Sweden, leaving on Friday.

[09:08] <brrt> rather exciting, an international move

[09:08] <brrt> :-)

[09:09] <jnthn> :-)

[09:10] <jnthn> Will be nice to populate the new place with some more of my stuffs :)

[09:10] <nwc10> yay

[09:10] <jnthn> Not least my comfortable keyboard and nice dev box and big screen :)

[09:10] <nwc10> https://ln.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekia

[09:12] <jnthn> brrt: Quite reassured that the patches, though they look plenty of work, came out nice and small :)

[09:13] <nwc10> that's a good thing. Sort of related to "It costs a lot of money to look this cheap" and "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."

[09:14] <brrt> hah, yes, i'm happy about that too

[09:14] <jnthn> aye

[09:15] <brrt> otoh, it's not quite ready for merging with luajit, and it's also not complete (as in, not all cases of addressing are done)

[09:15] <brrt> but the most important one for our use case is

[09:15] <nwc10> https://tpi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sek_Ripablik

[09:15] <nwc10> https://kaa.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shexiya

[09:16] <brrt> what languages are these

[09:16] <nwc10> er, I'm not sure

[09:16] <nwc10> https://ss.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekhi

[09:17] <nwc10> but it seems, if you try hard enough, almost any country can start with an S

[09:17] <jnthn> What on earth language is ss...

[09:18] <jnthn> ooh, Swazi

[09:18] <jnthn> Yet another one I know nothing about

[09:19] <jnthn> "iRiphablikhi yeShekhi"

[09:19] <jnthn> That's some curious capitlaization...

[09:20] <jnthn> ooh yay, boxman will show up in 30 mins.

[09:21] <jnthn> This is especially good 'cus I failed to have the foresight to go and buy something last night for today's lunch...

[09:22] <nwc10> boxman collects boxes?

[09:23] <nwc10> or boxman delivers more boxes?

[09:23] <brrt> http://www.strchr.com/x86_machine_code_statistics <- is interesting and recognisable

[09:23] <jnthn> Collects :)

[09:24] <nwc10> and then your all alone with the things that belong to the flat?

[09:24] <nwc10> and what you're travelling with

[09:28] <nwc10> brrt: it reminds me of what I noticed about ARM object files - hand written assembler looks very different from compiler generated assembler. The compiler seems to spend a lot of its time doing loads and stores

[09:28] <nwc10> the human has figured out how to get all the working data into the available registers, and codes accordingly

[09:28] * brrt nods

[09:28] <nwc10> (or, I guess, didn't write it in assembler)

[09:29] <brrt> well, in case of the moar-jit, a lot of time is also spent on maintainig VM invariants

[09:29] <brrt> like, 'this structure always points to this frame'

[09:30] <brrt> and of course that's a lot of what i'm trying to achieve :-)

[09:49] <jnthn> phew, done

[09:51] <jnthn> Looking at more examples of .ss, it seems the lowercase letters at the start of words are some kind of grammatical "marker".

[09:56] <masak> jnthn: I was trying to find out, and tell you. :) but that sounds reasonable.

[09:58] <jnthn> "Live weYurophu." is another example

[09:58] <jnthn> Yurophu is clearly "Europe"

[10:02] <masak> maybe they just add on whatever sounds nice. :)

[11:41] <FROGGS> jnthn: weYurophu is equivalent how you'd create such words in klingon

[11:42] <FROGGS> though, things like 'I do' or 'you are' are syllables that can be in front or after a noun, but attached to it

[11:46] <FROGGS> like:

[11:46] <FROGGS> I don't understand  -  jIyajbe'

[11:46] <FROGGS> I don't know  -  jISovbe'

[11:46] <FROGGS> I ...mumble... not

[12:05] <TEttinger> I don't know if they sell them in local stores, I bought two on amazon for about $20 each

[12:06] <TEttinger> also, thanks for your help, everyone, I now can compile and run the very basics of a lisp :D

[12:28] <lizmat> jnthn: re latest stuff, did we consider upgrading unicode to 8.0 yet ?

[12:29] <brrt> Q'apla!

[12:29] <brrt> anyway, jnthn, i'm probably an utter heretic

[12:30] <brrt> but i quite enjoy an occasional cup of powdered espresso coffee

[12:32] <nwc10> lizmat: yes, I blieve jnthn has been thinking about it

[12:33] <TEttinger> brrt: I don't even drink coffee, I take no-doz as pills (less acidic in my stomach)

[12:33] <lizmat> if it would be something "mechanical" like importing some data files and running a few scripts, maybe someone else can do that  :-)

[12:33] <nwc10> It never seems to be quite that simple

[12:33] <brrt> no-doz?

[12:33] <lizmat> if it is described somewhere, ther is...

[12:33] <lizmat> *that

[12:34] <TEttinger> brrt: caffeine in pill form

[12:34] <brrt> oh, that's horrible

[12:34] <TEttinger> I like coffee, it just messes up my stomach

[12:34] <brrt> no offense meant, but caffeine is a stronger drug than many people realize

[12:35] <TEttinger> I take less than most people get from energy drinks

[12:35] <TEttinger> monster energy messes me up

[12:35] <brrt> monster energy messes *everyone* up :-)

[12:36] <tadzik> brrt: doesn't that make coffee just as bad?

[12:36] <brrt> but yeah, i'm not encouraging energy drinks either

[12:36] <tadzik> (I'm not saying that it isn't :))

[12:36] <brrt> well, yes, it's one of these moderation things; and also the pleasure/effects tradeoff i guess? for me at least

[12:37] <brrt> coffee actually tastes nice, i mean to say

[12:37] <tadzik> I see

[12:37] <brrt> but using caffeine as an all-purpose booster is not a very good idea, and not very effective either

[12:37] <jnthn> lizmat: It's not quite mechanical in that somebody has to read the "what chnaged" summary of the spec and know if it's anything more than updating the database.

[12:37] <jnthn> lizmat: I did that part a few days ago.

[12:37] <tadzik> I don't really like the taste of coffee, but I *love* how it smells after grinding

[12:38] <jnthn> And it probably is just updating the DB

[12:38] <tadzik> maybe I should grind it, smell it, throw it away and take a pill instead

[12:38] <jnthn> I guess I may as well do it now while it's on my mind :)

[12:38] <TEttinger> brrt: oh I agree.  that's why I take vyvanse (prescription slow-acting amphetamine)

[12:38] <lizmat> jnthn++  :-)

[12:38] <brrt> lol TEttinger

[12:39] <jnthn> grmbl, I'm clogged up today

[12:39] <jnthn> I need meaner anti-histamine or something...

[12:39] <TEttinger> vyvanse doesn't help energy, it does make my focus basically superhuman

[12:39] <brrt> the company of computer programmers is the company of drug users :-D

[12:40] <TEttinger> well this is interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Enhancing_performance

[12:42] <TEttinger> at low doses, things like vyvanse (which are not the same as crystal meth, but similar if you compare 100x different doses) cause unambiguous cognitive performance improvements.  as in, no nervousness or panicky feelings like caffeine also causes at too high doses

[12:43] <psch> interesting that the study is only from this year

[12:43] <psch> oh, it's the review and meta-analysis that's from this year, i misread

[12:43] <TEttinger> yeah. it's difficult to study currently because it amphetamines are prescription medicines now, but more highly regulated

[12:44] <TEttinger> not as hard as studies on marijuana (it's fascinating how some epileptic people benefit from it even if the strain has no recreational effects)

[12:45] <jnthn> $ perl6-m -e "say ord qq[\c[SIGN OF THE HORNS]]"

[12:45] <jnthn> 129304

[12:45] <TEttinger> hahaha

[12:45] <jnthn> Well, thta Unicode 8 update wasn't so bad

[12:45] <TEttinger> is that the metal fingers?

[12:45] <jnthn> Let's see how the test suite likes it

[12:45] <jnthn> TEttinger: yes!

[12:45] <psch> awesome

[12:45] <jnthn> Unicode is now officially METAL

[12:45] <TEttinger> jnthn++

[12:45] <jnthn> I guess I should check we can actually build NQP and Rakudo as well as run the test suite. :)

[12:46] <TEttinger> naaaah

[12:46] <TEttinger> metal is justification enough

[12:46] <brrt> epilepsy is weird

[12:46] <TEttinger> brrt, yeah one of my best friends in high school had rough tics

[12:46] <brrt> one of my rats has it

[12:47] <brrt> one would not necessarly expect amarijuana to have a beneficial effect though

[12:47] <TEttinger> I like rats.  rats apparently like my birdfeeder.  cats like anything on he birdfeeder.

[12:48] <TEttinger> last time I touched a rat, it was inside the birdfeeder, getting every last morsel, and I gave it a scritch scratch on its incredibly soft back

[12:48] <TEttinger> then washed my hands :)

[12:50] <TEttinger> it's interesting how opossums are much uglier creatures than rats, pretty much without doubt, because the opossum uses that as a defense mechanism (it needs to look and smell dead)

[12:50] <TEttinger> but they both have the hairless gripping tail

[12:51] <TEttinger> drawing this back to perl, it makes you wonder about what makes a language visually appealing vs. actually effective

[12:52] <TEttinger> (opossums are the only surviving marsupial in north america.  there used to be tons in prehistoric south america)

[12:53] <brrt> aren't there anymore?

[12:53] <TEttinger> there are a small amount of relatives of opossums in south america, I think. most are in australia

[12:54] <TEttinger> there are possums that somehow got to new zealand, but they're non-native

[12:54] <brrt> anyway, perl5 (and perl6) give you tons of clues on what something is and what you're doing it in a very short amount of space

[12:54] <TEttinger> yep!

[12:54] <brrt> imho that's hugely valuable and something which really contributes (for me) to the feeling that i'm 'speaking' the language

[12:54] <brrt> rather than composing programs in it

[12:55] <jnthn> Well, all the S15 stuff passes with Unicode 8, at least

[12:57] <brrt> \o/ :-)

[12:58] <TEttinger> in biological terms, perl is similar to a rat in terms of adaptability; flexible, able to adapt to any environment, uses relatively few resources -- where a language like Java, with a 1600-page standard library documentation printout, is more similar to an elephant; able to do a few things a rat would find difficult (jumping is not one of them), but occupying a tiny fraction of their pre-human territory

[13:00] <jnthn> Darn it, my spectest repo was dirty so I did the test against outdated tests...

[13:00] <TEttinger> test the tests

[13:00] <masak> TEttinger: so you're saying that the arrival of humans made Java endangered? :P

[13:00] * jnthn sets it off again...

[13:00] <brrt> if only

[13:01] <jnthn> Maybe the arrival of Java endangered humans...

[13:01] <TEttinger> the closest equivalent to early hominids, who found elephants really good sources of spareribs and other tasty meat, in a programming field might be scripting languages in general

[13:02] <TEttinger> monkeys and primates had been around for a while

[13:02] <brrt> the biggest weakness of rats are their short lifes, offset by their high reproductive rate

[13:04] <TEttinger> but early hominids developed a way to compensate for a relatively weak body, with tool use.  you could compare it to how JS had been around but unsuitable for writing lots in, then it became an everywhere platform that suddenly got a good JIT too...

[13:05] <TEttinger> a less verbose language with a good JIT, versus a more verbose language with a good JIT, it's no wonder java's getting less usage

[13:06] <TEttinger> (even on android, the android V8 JS engine outperforms their Dalvik Java runtime)

[13:06] <TEttinger> (sometimes)

[13:06] <brrt> that sometimes is kind of important :-)

[13:06] <TEttinger> also, Dalvik is pretty awful

[13:07] <TEttinger> they "creatively interpreted" what the static keyword does...

[13:07] <brrt> 'optimised for a different scenario' is how we prefer to call it :-P

[13:08] <TEttinger> static variables last longer than your application does, which is ok if you expect to shut down and start up in a perfectly optimal scenario.  but not if those static variables have native associated state, like an OpenGL context, in which case those variables suddenly refer to junk VRAM

[13:08] <TEttinger> this has no equivalent on desktop java

[13:09] <TEttinger> it was made up entirely by google and it's a pain.

[13:10] <masak> TEttinger: that sounds weird and interesting. do you have a URL explaining that in more detail?

[13:11] <jnthn> After the Unicode upgrade I get 3 new failures in S05-mass/properties-derived.t

[13:11] <TEttinger> I'm not sure, I only know it from solving the recurring issues that people get from it in #libgdx here on freenode.  that's a java game lib that works on android and desktop (and others that aren't as often)

[13:12] <brrt> jnthn: that could potentially be database disagreements?

[13:13] <jnthn> I think it may be a bad test.

[15:36] <jnthn> timotimo: Heh, that task does get more exciting as it'll combine nicely with brrt++'s JIT work :)

[15:42] <TEttinger> perl 6: now 98% made without the use of thaumaturgy!

[15:43] <TEttinger> * blood sacrifices to aztec gods don't count

[15:44] <TEttinger> interesting thing to note: the aztecs believed that literally all of their gods were dead, which explained perfectly reasonably why those gods could be in charge of the afterlife

[15:48] <TEttinger> and with multiple preceding worlds, the gods of the mortal world had themselves worshipped dead gods in a preceding version of reality, and I don't know what the view was on whether a world and an afterlife ago was a thing.  it makes you wonder if semantic versioning is much older than we thought :P

[15:52] <TEttinger> CHANGELOG FOR WORLD 5.0.0: Breaking Changes are many, first you need to refer to Tlaloc and any of his children in the cosmos::afterlife package, and the cosmos::material package is... hang on, someone committed all the antimatter out of cosmos::material. DO NOT USE 5.0.0, use 5.1.0.

[16:05] <timotimo> about the x86 machine code statistics article: i would have liked to see the instructions multiplied by their length and then graphed as a pie

[16:52] <JimmyZ_> jnthn: IS_CONCRETE should be first since REPR(o) may be NULL, iirc

[16:52] <jnthn> IS_CONCRETE isn't a nullness check

[16:53] <timotimo> right, we have MVM_is_null for that

[16:53] <jnthn> Even a VMNull has a REPR

[16:53] <timotimo> yup

[16:53] <timotimo> but is_null also checks for a null pointer

[16:53] <timotimo> BBIAB

[16:53] <JimmyZ_> someone said it should be first two years ago.😊

[16:54] <JimmyZ_> before vmnull though
