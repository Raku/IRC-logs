[07:44] <jnthn> brrt: Left a comment on your grant app :)

[07:44] <jnthn> (It's in the mod queue)

[07:45] <brrt> thanks :-)

[07:46] <brrt> i've received one comment so far

[07:57] <jnthn> Noticed. It was positive. :)

[07:59] <brrt> yes :-)

[13:46] <[Coke]> I can't believe this made it through to the grant: "and it's API"

[13:47] <timotimo> well, the grant didn't "win" yet

[13:47] <timotimo> still time to shoot it down because of that grave mistake

[14:10] *** zakharyas joined
[14:15] <FROGGS> -.-

[14:16] <timotimo> just kidding. i'm very much +1 on the whole grant proposal

[14:17] <FROGGS> I hope so :o)

[14:17] <timotimo> and excited for the result

[14:40] * jnthn also

[14:43] * [Coke] +1s it on the blog.

[14:43] <FROGGS> jnthn: how would you traverse a hash containing different kinds of things to set their SC?

[14:45] <FROGGS> I guess should stringify most of the things :/

[14:45] <FROGGS> though, that does not sound too cheap

[14:48] <FROGGS> hmmm, I guess I should create several SCs :o/

[14:56] <jnthn> FROGGS: You more want to clear it, no?

[14:58] <FROGGS> jnthn: that would also do, yeah

[14:58] *** Ven joined
[14:59] <jnthn> FROGGS: I'm trying to think of a clean way to do it...

[14:59] <FROGGS> can I do something sensible with popcompsc?

[14:59] <timotimo> objsetsc won't help?

[14:59] <FROGGS> timotimo: that affects only one level

[14:59] <jnthn> FROGGS: Not especially

[14:59] <jnthn> Yeah, it's only one level

[14:59] <timotimo> OK

[15:00] *** lizmat joined
[15:00] <jnthn> I'm more wondering if we want to provide some API when serializing that's like "treat anything with SC X as if it hasn't one"

[15:00] <FROGGS> a few hours ago I was thinking that I might create new SCs when installing a new dist...

[15:01] <FROGGS> though that will also not scale perfectly

[15:04] <timotimo> nqp::scunbound(...)

[18:00] <FROGGS> jnthn: is there a check for a matching SC when serializing an object?

[18:00] <FROGGS> jnthn: and, what does 'packed' mean in serialize_object() ?

[18:37] *** brrt joined
[18:37] <brrt> \o

[18:39] <FROGGS> o/

[18:44] <brrt> nothing yet on the tpf blog
