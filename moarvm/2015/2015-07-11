[12:27] <brrt> register allocation is hard

[12:27] <brrt> what if i'm too dumb for all this?

[12:30] <brrt> then i'll still have to find a solution :-)

[12:30] <brrt> maybe it's better to say

[12:30] <brrt> what if my earlier ideas were wrong

[12:37] <brrt> one of these ideas: 'you can do everything you want using generic tree traversal

[12:55] <brrt> i'm fairly sure i can use the SSA calculations from spesh in some wy

[12:55] <brrt> just don't know how yet

[13:35] <brrt> hmm..i'll be back later

[16:00] <cognominal> what is a PHI ops?

[16:01] <cognominal> got it :  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: e1a0e20 | brrt++ | src/jit/expr (2 files):

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Implement sp_p6ogetvt_o as expression template

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: This required the addition of a few new jit ops, notably

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: do (for a sequence of statements yielding the last), all

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: (logical and of a series) and any (logical or). and and or

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: become their corresponding binary operations.

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: I note that I have not found some way to deal with operand types

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: (i.e. size) yet, although the sizes are explicit in loads and

[16:21] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: stores.
