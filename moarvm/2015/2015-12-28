[12:48] <mojca> I would like to package MoarVM (and Perl6) in MacPorts and I'm having some issues with it, mainly connected with the use of internal vs. external libraries like libuv, libtommath etc.

[12:50] <mojca> In the perl6 channel people told me that I should really try to use the internal libraries (shipped with the tarball)

[12:50] <mojca> but then I have this problem: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/321

[12:50] <timotimo> wait wait, don't we have macports already?

[12:51] <timotimo> cf. https://trac.macports.org/ticket/47803

[12:51] <mojca> whoooops

[12:51] <timotimo> https://trac.macports.org/ticket/48904 - a bit less out of date

[12:51] <mojca> I didn't see it

[12:51] <timotimo> [coke] is your contact for this :)

[12:52] <mojca> I'm sorry, my bad

[12:52] <timotimo> don't worry about it! :)

[12:52] <mojca> Just to make sure: did anyone already package Perl6 then :)

[12:52] <timotimo> i honestly have no clue about macports

[12:54] <mojca> OK, in any case we desperately need to update the port in order to make it compatible with the latest release (and also fix it in various ways then)

[12:56] <timotimo> OK

[12:57] <timotimo> in that case your help would probably be nice to have!

[13:00] <mojca> does [coke] refer to the irc user (including the brackets)?

[13:01] <lizmat> mojca: yes

[13:01] <lizmat> well, [Coke] technically

[13:23] <mojca> In case he's not listening at the moment, does anyone else know what "may need ExtUtil::Command if by chance our default perl5 binary does not match what Apple ships." could mean?

[14:25] <mojca> I opened https://trac.macports.org/ticket/50153 for MacPorts

[14:26] <mojca> I'm looking forward to see [Coke]'s feedback, so that we could eventually add perl6 to MacPorts

[14:27] <mojca> and I need some of your general help to fix this issue with conflicting locations of files of 3rd party libraries

[14:30] *** leont joined
[14:42] *** _wiz_ joined
[14:42] <_wiz_> hi.

[14:43] <_wiz_> I want to build MoarVM using the installed libffi, but

[14:43] <_wiz_> probing whether your compiler thinks that it is gcc  Shared object "libffi.so.6" not found

[14:43] <_wiz_> and that part of the configure script doesn't seem to honor ENV{LDFLAGS}

[14:47] <timotimo> did you try --with-libffi for this?

[14:47] <timotimo> unfortunately i didn't do anything much with the build system yet

[14:48] <_wiz_> yes, i'm using that flag

[14:50] <_wiz_> that does unshift @{$config{usrlibs}}, 'ffi';

[14:50] <_wiz_> and that probably adds -lffi

[14:51] <_wiz_> but not the necessary -L / -Wl,-R

[15:37] <[Coke]> ok, opening a macport ticket with 30 issues on it is going to be hard to clear. :|

[15:40] <[Coke]> we specifically did not add universal variant because, IIRC, it failed testing.

[15:44] <[Coke]> the perl comment was added, I believe, by the macport committer who helped me get the port in; his concern was that we might end up with a version of perl that didn't have ExtUtil::Command available. (but ISTR that the version we depended on in ports would always have it)

[15:47] <[Coke]> what is "openmaintainer" ?

[15:47] <[Coke]> mojca: there are no tests. what would we run?

[15:47] <mojca> I'm sorry, I noticed that about tests later

[15:48] <mojca> But tests can be run in nqp

[15:48] <[Coke]> that's for the nqp port. right.

[15:48] <mojca> openmaintainer means that other maintainers have the freedom to do trivial updates and changes

[15:49] <mojca> sometimes ports are maintained by people that are hardly active and it might take a long time to get approval to update the port

[15:49] <[Coke]> is a maintainer a specific person or just anyone who submits a patch?

[15:49] <mojca> openmaintainer means that anyone can, say, upgrade to a later version

[15:50] <mojca> developers are not supposed to change port unless maintainer approves the change (or doesn't respond for at leat 72 hours)

[15:50] <mojca> maintainers are assigned tickets

[15:50] <mojca> with problems etc.

[15:50] <[Coke]> I'm happy to have have multiple specific maintainers. we also have https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tree/master/ports/macports which I don't think you found yet.

[15:50] <mojca> no, I didn't

[15:50] <mojca> thank you

[15:51] <mojca> see what Ionic just wrote on #macports (http://echelog.com/logs/browse/macports/1451257200)

[15:54] <[Coke]> I'm sure we don't want to create a macport bundle for each 3rd party library with mods we use.

[15:54] <[Coke]> (because it's a lot of work. It's probably the right thing to do, but we're not designed for that.)

[15:56] <hoelzro> o/ #moarvm

[15:56] <mst> that doesn't mean we wouldn't be rather happy if somebody else created those ports though, right?

[16:08] <hoelzro> I know that I asked last week about GC order in MoarVM, but I was wondering if there's an ordering if, for example, A is reachable from B but neither is reachable from the root set.  Obviously that gets complicated when there are circular references

[16:09] <diakopter> no, still not predictable

[16:10] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/dc0db11929

[16:10] <diakopter> why would it help if it was predictable?

[16:11] <[Coke]> mojca: there's 2 things added to our copy of the portfile.

[16:11] <hoelzro> ok, that's what I thought

[16:12] <hoelzro> it would help because if A has a reference to B, it might need to do something with B in its own cleanup

[16:12] <hoelzro> but now that I type it, that seems like a contrived example, because any clean up B needs should be in B's gc_free

[16:26] <[Coke]> mojca: if you have updates for the README in our portfile directory, please submit a PR. Or gist an updated copy.

[16:27] <mojca> ok, will do

[16:27] <mojca> I'll just commit the change if that's ok and then we can proceed to nqp?

[16:27] <[Coke]> you have commit bits to moarvm? sure.

[16:28] <[Coke]> also, what's your comaint line look like?

[16:29] <[Coke]> happy to share. I was planning on doing this stuff this week since I was tied up with other perl6 things earlier, glad to have someone else show up with it mostly done. :)

[16:30] <[Coke]> oh, you meant in macports. also fine.

[16:32] <mojca> yes, in MacPorts

[16:32] <mojca> I'll try to get the other changes to you afterwards

[16:34] <[Coke]> So the plan for nqp and rakudo was to get them working with both moarvm & jvm backend variants, which is why I didn't just do them.

[16:35] <[Coke]> the plan for this week was going to be: hell with JVM for now, get nqp & rakudo ports that are moarvm only out there.

[16:35] <mojca> nqp: should there be a single package supporting both?

[16:35] <[Coke]> I was going to do the same thing of keeping a snapshot in the existing repos of the portfile to make it easier for a project dev (rather than a macport dev) get them committed on future releases.

[16:35] <mojca> but if you don't care about jvm for now, we could start with moarvm only for now

[16:36] <[Coke]> mojca: was going to use variants so you could use nqp-moar or nqp-jvm (or, I suppose, both)

[16:36] <[Coke]> Yes. don't care about jvm for now; it's not part of christamas.

[16:36] <[Coke]> *christmas

[16:36] <mojca> ok

[16:36] <[Coke]> So glad you showed up! I now get a day back on my holiday. :)

[16:37] <mojca> a day back?

[16:37] <[Coke]> I am happy to take comaint on the nqp/rakudo ones; but also fine with you being sole maint. Thanks for your help on the moarvm one, too!

[16:38] <[Coke]> oh, no it was you saying "nqp: ". :)

[16:38] <[Coke]> you triggered the eval bot. :)

[16:39] <mojca> ooooops

[16:41] <mojca> I initially copy-pasted the description for nqp from the README

[16:41] <mojca> "Not Quite Perl" (NQP) is a subset of Perl 6 clearly not intended as a Perl 6 implementation for end user. ...

[16:41] <mojca> I would like the description to mention "Not Quite Perl" somewhere. Otherwise it becomes impossible to remember the name

[16:53] <mojca> http://trac.macports.org/ticket/50154

[17:12] <[Coke]> I would remove everything after "for end user" in the description.

[17:12] <[Coke]> that all refers to parrot, which we really don't support at this point. (would be fine in a list of all backends, but lets just leave it out)

[17:12] <[Coke]> (for nqp)

[20:00] <_wiz_> any suggestions how to get LDFLAGS into the Configure.pl compiler checks?

[20:04] <hoelzro> _wiz_: which flags in particular?

[20:05] *** llfourn joined
[20:06] <_wiz_> I'd like to pass in -L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-R/usr/pkg/lib so that libffi is found correctly

[20:09] <hoelzro> hmm, that I'm not sure how to do

[20:12] <_wiz_> I need this because I want to use the installed libffi.

[20:14] <hoelzro> apparently Configure.pl will read from LDFLAGS and add them to the Makefile

[20:14] <hoelzro> _wiz_: ↑

[20:18] <_wiz_> it looks that way, but if it does, it does it too late.

[20:18] <hoelzro> hmm

[20:19] <hoelzro> ah, I see

[20:19] <hoelzro> or maybe not...

[20:19] <hoelzro> I see it in the "link" part of Configure's report

[20:19] <hoelzro> but not libs

[20:26] <hoelzro> _wiz_: I got it working on my box

[20:26] <hoelzro> CFLAGS=-I/tmp/ffi-install/lib/libffi-3.2.1/include LDFLAGS=-L/tmp/ffi-install/lib perl Configure.pl --has-libffi

[20:33] <_wiz_> no, no luck here.

[20:33] <_wiz_> https://paste.debian.net/356775/

[20:38] <hoelzro> _wiz_: which OS are you on?

[20:40] <_wiz_> NetBSD, why?

[20:40] <_wiz_> have you tried with LDFLAGS with a space inside?

[20:40] <hoelzro> I haven't

[20:41] *** brrt joined
[20:41] <hoelzro> ok, just did

[20:41] <hoelzro> that worked =/

[20:41] <brrt> ohhai

[20:41] <hoelzro> o/ brrt

[20:42] <brrt> hi hoelzro

[20:46] <_wiz_> hm, weird.a

[20:49] <hoelzro> _wiz_: I think I understand now

[20:50] <hoelzro> I don't think the probing stuff respects LDFLAGS or CFLAGS

[20:51] <brrt> no, it doesn't

[20:51] <brrt> can be made too

[20:51] <brrt> but doesn't do it now

[20:51] <hoelzro> ah, well that explains it

[20:52] <brrt> you'll want something like $config{ldflags} .= $ENV{LDFLAGS} // ''

[20:52] <brrt> somewhere

[20:52] <brrt> for what it's worth, /me can't figure out why libuv can build without cfmakeraw on solaris, but it's probably a mad flags issue

[20:54] <_wiz_> I just added printf debugging and here's the command line (even with LDFLAGS in the env):

[20:54] <_wiz_> gcc -o try try.o -lffi -ltommath -latomic_ops -luv -lm -lpthread -lkvm >/dev/null 2>&1

[20:56] <hoelzro> that looks consistent with what I saw

[20:56] <hoelzro> so now making a change similar to brrt's suggestion would probably fix things

[20:56] <_wiz_> this seems to work: https://paste.debian.net/356781/

[20:57] <brrt> actually, in keeping with nwc10++'s suggestion, the whole darn thing will want rewriting

[20:57] <brrt> as far as i'm concerned

[20:57] <brrt> and... i wonder

[20:57] <hoelzro> that makes sense to me

[20:57] <hoelzro> you'll probably want a parallel CFLAGS change further up

[20:58] <brrt> why have all this probing logic, when we can just compile a file using the standard compiler, and figure out all bits of our architecture

[20:59] <brrt> there are all sorts of compiler standard definitions that can be used to figure out our toolchain and platform

[20:59] <hoelzro> mhmm

[20:59] <brrt> and if you just evaluate the equivalent of 'cc', well, it will figure out all bits by itself

[20:59] <hoelzro> http://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Home/

[20:59] <hoelzro> ↑ comes in handy

[21:00] <brrt> that's pretty much what i mean, yes
