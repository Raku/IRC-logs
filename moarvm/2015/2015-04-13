[17:07] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:07] <dalek> MoarVM: Coverity scan pointed out that the variable `ann` wasn't being freed before

[17:07] <dalek> MoarVM: the function MVM_code_location() returned.  This should fix this issue.  The

[17:07] <dalek> MoarVM: NQP tests all pass after having made this change (there aren't any MoarVM

[17:07] <dalek> MoarVM: tests), so it seems that everything still works as expected.

[19:23] <jnthn> f3512a8 looks legit, but I now think we should check other callsites for that function :)

[19:23] <timotimo> yeah

[19:23] <timotimo> i can do that

[19:26] <jnthn> already found 2 here :)

[19:27] <jnthn> (and written le patches)

[19:28] <timotimo> i see

[19:29] <dalek> MoarVM: 88592c7 | jnthn++ | src/ (3 files):

[19:29] <dalek> MoarVM: More missing frees of bytecode annotations.

[19:29] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/88592c7105

[19:30] <timotimo> at least the one in the profiler and spesh seem "hot"

[19:31] <timotimo> so that's very good

[19:31] <timotimo> though since the data is apparently always extremely short-lived, we may want to allocate it on the stack of the caller and populate it in the callee

[19:31] <jnthn> maybe, though none of it is hot path, afaik

[19:32] <timotimo> yeah

[19:32] <timotimo> just a little tingling sensation in my nose :P

[19:32] <timotimo> :-P
