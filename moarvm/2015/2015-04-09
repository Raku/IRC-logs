[10:58] <dalek> MoarVM: add op "getcodelocation"; gets file and line of a MVMCode

[10:58] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/42e3d2ea5c

[11:47] <JimmyZ> timotimo: I think ^^ is a bit wrong

[11:47] <timotimo> OK, what do i have to change?

[11:48] <JimmyZ> you can't put MVM_repr_box_str to the args directly

[11:49] <JimmyZ> that's is gc move problem, said two year ago. :P

[11:49] <timotimo> well, this is the convenience wrapper from reprconv.c

[11:49] <timotimo> oh?

[11:50] <JimmyZ> you put filename_key in the arg stack, and then box allloces, and filename_key moved by gc .

[11:50] <JimmyZ> you will got null

[11:50] <timotimo> oh

[11:50] <timotimo> yes

[11:52] <timotimo> i think maybe i'll use temp root push calls instead of MVMROOT

[11:53] <JimmyZ> yes, I like temp root push too :).

[12:02] <timotimo> JimmyZ: https://gist.github.com/timo/c4f0a662957771347a31ghhhhhhhhhhhhhhnfgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq9 looks better now?

[12:02] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/c4f0a662957771347a31 (minus the cat)

[12:05] <jnthn> temp root push is just hard to see the pairing.

[12:05] <jnthn> So I discourage it generally.

[12:05] <JimmyZ> yeah, but could avoid two temp push by re-order the code, allocaces it and then use the var

[12:06] <JimmyZ> I mean bind  it  earlier

[12:06] <jnthn> Givne it's hugely unlikely this is hot path code, I'd write it to be obviously correct :P

[12:09] <timotimo> so ... is this code correct-ish now?

[12:10] <JimmyZ> MMVM_gc_root_temp_push(tc, (MVMCollectable **)&linenumber_boxed); is not needed

[12:11] <timotimo> ah, you are right

[12:11] <timotimo> that's the only problem?

[12:12] <JimmyZ> so yeah, it is correct , methinks :P

[12:12] <timotimo> thanks :)

[12:39] <JimmyZ> MVMObject is always a trap, big  C trap :P

[12:40] <timotimo> that's right

[12:43] <timotimo> and also putting declarations in the middle of the curlied spaces :(

[12:43] <timotimo> that's my kryptonite

[13:18] <timotimo> JimmyZ: thanks for catching my mistakes; i was in between places when i pushed that; didn't try to build even though i should have

[23:08] <timotimo> i can't really get the number of Int, Scalar and BOOTCode allocations down

[23:09] <timotimo> it's like a darn waterbed
