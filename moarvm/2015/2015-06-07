[17:57] <FROGGS> jnthn: I was meant to ping you about updating moarvm.org...

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: 81835a8 | FROGGS++ | / (11 files):

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: improve openpipe to allow to read from out/err and write to in

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3:

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: In the past were were only able to open a pipe to a process and read its

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: stdout. There was no way to write to its stdin or read in its stderr without

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: merging in into stdout via shell output redirection. Now we can do all this.

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/81835a8dbf

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: 7de3582 | FROGGS++ | src/io/procops.c:

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: only check handle if we are meant to use it

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7de3582b46

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: 665ea0b | FROGGS++ | / (6 files):

[18:05] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: make spawn and shell capable of capturing in/ouput like openpipe

[18:35] <jnthn> FROGGS: ooh...thanks

[18:35] <FROGGS> :o)

[18:57] <dalek> moarvm.org: Update site for 2015.05.

[18:57] <dalek> moarvm.org: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/commit/83758a821b

[18:58] <jnthn> FROGGS++ # reminding me :)

[18:59] <FROGGS> pleasure :o)

[19:00] <jnthn> 2015.05 was a pretty cool release :)

[19:00] <FROGGS> aye

[19:01] <FROGGS> .06 will be quite boring in contrast I fear

[19:02] <jnthn> At already contains some important fixes

[19:02] <jnthn> (For conc things)

[19:02] <jnthn> And JIT improvements

[19:02] <FROGGS> true

[19:03] <FROGGS> I hope I can put some lines into the changelog too this month

[19:04] <jnthn> I intend to put some more in also :)

[19:05] <FROGGS> hehe

[19:05] <FROGGS> I guessed so :o)

[20:46] <brrt> \o

[20:48] <japhb> o/

[20:48] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[20:48] <brrt> turns out my talk proposal at yapc::eu was accepted :-)

[20:49] <jnthn> \o/

[20:49] <jnthn> Mine too :)

[20:49] <brrt> oh, very nice

[20:49] <brrt> what is it about

[20:49] <jnthn> MoarVM :)

[20:50] <japhb> Now we just need to convince ++jnthn to do the talk we just discussed in #perl6 ... :-)

[20:50] <jnthn> http://act.yapc.eu/ye2015/talk/6260

[20:51] <brrt> nice :-)

[20:51] <brrt> i'll be attending

[20:51] <jnthn> japhb: "How to pretend you have Perl when you have C#"? :)

[20:52] <brrt> well, you're allowed too, and it has interest?

[20:53] <japhb> jnthn: No, how to break free of C#/Java limitations when you're using C#/Java patterns in Perl 6.  :-)

[20:53] <jnthn> Ohhh :)

[20:53] <jnthn> Yeah, that *could* be a good talk, though I probably want to do it at a conference that is not just a Perl one, but rather one with folks using a bunch of languages :)

[20:54] <japhb> I actually think aside from the particular pattern we were discussing (which might be a good talk in and of itself), there'd be a great benefit to allowing us to use the full pattern language of the larger community without being straightjacketed by the original language conceptions.

[20:54] <japhb> Agreed about giving the talk at a multilingual conference.  :-)

[20:55] <japhb> Although ... seems like a lot of 6'ers speak a plethora of langua.

[20:55] <japhb> lingua?

[20:55] <japhb> hmmm

[20:56] <jnthn> languages? :P

[20:58] <japhb> I think my brain tried to mix lingua and languages into one

[20:58] <japhb> :-)
