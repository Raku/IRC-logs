[11:45] <timotimo> today i'll be visiting the museum (free entry on fridays) and then watch Ant Man, so probably not much progress on the graph.c parser

[11:46] <timotimo> oh?

[11:46] <timotimo> i didn't even realize

[11:47] <timotimo> what not having a day job can do to you ...

[11:48] <brrt> i can imagine

[11:51] <brrt> anyway, you can always just put it on a gist somewhere, if you want, but i probably won't look at it this weekend

[14:44] *** JimmyZ_ joined
[14:50] <[Coke]> ISTR there's a gcc compiler warning we can add and turn into an error so that stuff like that doesn't build anywhere.

[14:50] <[Coke]> Pretty sure alester got that working for us on parrot back in the day

[15:22] <japhb> That would be mighty useful indeed.

[17:45] <jnthn> [Coke]: I've done the portfile updated just now, about to push

[17:45] <jnthn> [Coke]: But if you could submit the ticket that'd be great.

[17:46] <jnthn> Please check I did it right too; I didn't see anything to update besides the version.

[17:46] <[Coke]> jnthn: the hashes.

[17:47] <[Coke]> it's doc'd in the readme. I'll get it, no worries.

[17:48] <[Coke]> if someone wanted to MDify ports/macports/README, that'd be cool.

[17:49] <[Coke]> http://moarvm.org/releases.html is out of date.

[17:49] <[Coke]> also, iwbni http://moarvm.org/releases/ sorted in reverse.

[17:52] <jnthn> [Coke]: ah, sorry, I should learn to read

[17:52] <jnthn> Yeah, I didn't update the website yet. Will get to it after diiner, which I hope will be delivered soon 'cus I'm really hungry :)

[17:53] <[Coke]> jnthn: no worries. you don't have an OS X box to do this on, do you?

[17:53] <[Coke]> I haven't had anything but coffee, cream, and splenda today. still not hungry.

[17:53] <[Coke]> I am kind of wondering how long that's going to take to catch up with me. :)

[17:54] <jnthn> [Coke]: No OS X box locally, no

[17:55] <jnthn> [Coke]: I fixed (I think) the http://moarvm.org/releases/ sort order to do what you asked

[17:59] <[Coke]> much better, now it's latest first. jnthn++

[18:00] <[Coke]> jnthn: (os x) so you couldn't do that part anyway, then. (checksums, testing port)

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: Update the roadmap.

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org:

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: Also, stop guesstimating dates on these things. MoarVM's reason to

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: exist is Perl 6, and the foucs needs to be on doing what we need for

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: the Christmas 2015 release. The things on here are all good to have,

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: but given the almost total overlap between the MoarVM and Perl 6

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: teams, it's best to let Perl 6's needs drive the priorities.

[19:04] <dalek> moarvm.org: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/commit/e0c6a8ddce

[19:04] <jnthn> OK, release stuffs all done :)
