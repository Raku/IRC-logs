[19:51] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: give MVMOSHandle a type flag, we can check later

[19:51] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3:

[19:51] <dalek> MoarVM/openpipe3: Now we can distinguish files from pipes from streams.

[19:52] <nebuchadnezzar> MoarVM accepted into Debian Unstable: https://tracker.debian.org/news/690052

[19:52] <nwc10> \o/

[19:53] <nwc10> and now we get to see how many platforms it builds on?

[19:54] <FROGGS> \o/

[19:55] <FROGGS> nwc10: https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=moarvm

[19:56] <FROGGS> that does look not even bad me thinks

[19:58] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar++ and dod++

[19:58] <nwc10> https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=moarvm&arch=s390x&ver=2015.04-1&stamp=1434310450 -- dyncall_callvm.c:68:4: error: #error unsupported platform

[19:58] <nwc10> er, should have bolded dyncall_callvm.c too

[20:01] <FROGGS> gnukfreebsd might be doable

[20:04] <hoelzro> has anyone here tried building MoarVM on FreeBSD?

[20:04] <FROGGS> bartolin++ does

[20:05] <FROGGS> (successfully)

[20:08] <hoelzro> alright, so I must have something wrong here

[20:09] <FROGGS> hoelzro: may I assist?

[20:10] <hoelzro> FROGGS: I'll try to play around a little on my own for a bit; clang just can't seem to compile src/core/interp.c

[20:10] <hoelzro> it just sits there and drives CPU to 100%

[20:11] <FROGGS> hoelzro: give it a few minutes

[20:11] <FROGGS> clang is slooooow

[20:11] <hoelzro> oh, really?

[20:11] * hoelzro tries again

[20:11] <FROGGS> and interp.c is huuuuuge

[20:11] <FROGGS> aye

[20:16] *** brrt joined
[20:22] <hoelzro> FROGGS: thanks for the trip, it worked!

[20:22] <hoelzro> I had no idea clang was so slow

[20:23] <FROGGS> yeah, perhaps it dislikes huge switch statements or so

[20:25] <FROGGS> mipsel just failed with: ./libmoar.so: undefined reference to `dcCallbackThunkEntry'

[20:41] <jnthn> evening, #moarvm

[20:41] <japhb> o/ here too.  :-)

[20:41] <japhb> How goes your Sunday evening?

[20:43] <jnthn> Well, I just got to Stockholm, and the weather is a lot better than it was in Yorkshire... :)

[20:43] <FROGGS> jnthn: ahh, you visited your parents?

[20:44] <jnthn> Well, bit of a multi-purpose UK trip really :)

[20:44] <jnthn> Was at the DDDX conf on Friday in London, then sister had an engagement party on the Saturday. So I got lucky and could do both in one trip. :)

[20:44] <FROGGS> there is more than one way to purpose :o)

[20:46] <jnthn> Also, with luck, I may have gotten to the bottom of my less than awesome health for the last weeks. Fingers crossed on that one...

[20:46] <FROGGS> jnthn: what do you mean by 'to the bottom'...?

[20:47] <jnthn> FROGGS: Figured out what's up and how to treat it.

[20:47] <FROGGS> you get enough rest or you finally met a Dr.?

[20:47] <FROGGS> ahh

[20:47] <jnthn> Well, I was exhausted, which I've fixed by now, but was still feeling dizzy.

[20:48] <jnthn> Seems that I've got some hayfever-ish thing; thinking back, I've often been a bit sniffly in spring/summer but it was always ignorable. This time it got me bad, and clogged up the series of tubes that control balance.

[20:48] <FROGGS> good luck with that :o)

[20:48] <FROGGS> same for me btw

[20:49] <FROGGS> in the last decade only my eyes made problems, but also ignorable

[20:49] <FROGGS> this year I need more tissues than I can carry

[20:49] <jnthn> Ah. This is the first year I had itchy eyes. That's what tipped me off that the whole thing I was getting was likely allergy related.

[20:50] <jnthn> But yeah, it's icky.

[20:50] <FROGGS> *nod*

[20:51] <jnthn> BTW, I wasn't overly delighted with MVMOSHandle gaining a flag. The point of the vtable-y thing in there was to have dispatch rather than flag checking...

[20:51] <FROGGS> ohh... hmmmm

[20:52] <jnthn> But is the flag only interesting in the case of syncfile handles?

[20:52] <jnthn> If so, it could live inside the data for that...

[20:52] <FROGGS> I need to pull out the fd for a syncfile, and the uv_stream for syncpipe/syncstream

[20:53] <FROGGS> in order to pass that to uv_spawn

[20:54] <FROGGS> here: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ffe7246c9d64a0290d759020f6696bfa6752c641#diff-b5a25723056e36538de36ea9515f7198R187

[20:55] <FROGGS> I can turn it around potentially, but it also wont look nice I guess

[20:56] <jnthn> *nod*

[20:57] <jnthn> Well, tht siwtch is another symptom...

[20:57] <jnthn> *that switch

[20:58] <jnthn> I mean, could have a method in the vtable that the stdio thingy gets passed to. bind_handle or some more appropriate name.

[20:59] <FROGGS> yeah...

[20:59] <jnthn> That'd get rid of both smells :)

[21:00] <FROGGS> I'll change it :O9

[21:01] <FROGGS> :o)*

[21:02] <jnthn> FROGGS++

[21:06] * FROGGS .oO( struct MVMIOInformative { void (*bind_handle) (...) { ... }; MVMint64 (*get_handle) (...) { ... }; }

[21:06] <FROGGS> though that's also quite off

[21:06] <FROGGS> names are hard

[21:07] <FROGGS> jnthn: btw, you already built latest moar on your box by any chance?

[21:07] <timotimo> itchy eyes is one of the worst things i know

[21:07] <FROGGS> I hope that my mingw patches did not break your setup

[21:07] <timotimo> when i was little, i used to get that really, really bad

[21:08] <timotimo> used to rub the skin around my eyes raw :|

[21:08] <FROGGS> I did test it using cmd.exe (without vcvars but with gmake), then with cmd+vcvars and finally with windows sdk prompt

[21:08] <FROGGS> timotimo: wow :o(

[21:08] <jnthn> FROGGS: No

[21:08] <timotimo> i may be exaggerating a bit

[21:08] <timotimo> but i did hate it

[21:09] <jnthn> FROGGS: pulling now

[21:10] <FROGGS> jnthn: nqp and rakudo are using now the make utility that moarvm was built with

[21:13] <jnthn> FROGGS: Well, Moar built

[21:14] <FROGGS> that's a start :o)

[21:18] <jnthn> NQP works out fine too

[21:18] <FROGGS> ossum

[21:23] <jnthn> FROGGS: Rakudo fine too

[21:24] <FROGGS> yay :o)
