[11:04] <dalek> MoarVM: Emit negative sequence # at end of async reads.

[11:04] <dalek> MoarVM:

[11:04] <dalek> MoarVM: This means that code receiving the data can cope with seeing the end

[11:04] <dalek> MoarVM: of sequence before other data, and not lose the end of the data.

[11:43] <d4l3k_> MoarVM: Revert "Emit negative sequence # at end of async reads."

[11:43] <d4l3k_> MoarVM: When done, emit sequence number but no data.

[11:43] <d4l3k_> MoarVM:

[11:43] <d4l3k_> MoarVM: This is more robust than using a negative, since if we get on data

[11:43] <d4l3k_> MoarVM: then we send -0, which is the same as 0 with ints.
