[07:39] <nwc10> o/

[07:46] <brrt> i have good news! dynasm is broken

[07:46] <brrt> more importantly

[07:46] <brrt> i have golfed down where it is broken

[07:47] <FROGGS> brrt++

[07:49] <brrt> it's kind of weird, actually

[07:49] <brrt> but, i'm sure i'll figure it out

[07:50] <FROGGS> well, otherwise it would be boring

[07:52] <brrt> that's true, i guess

[07:52] <brrt> there's supposed to be an extra extra byte in movs? it's weird, really

[08:01] <FROGGS> I have no knowledge whatsoever about asm

[08:01] <psch> i have enough asm knowledge to be dangerous!

[08:02] <psch> ...not enough to be useful, though

[08:03] <FROGGS> *g*

[08:05] <psch> reminds me of my neglected H6809 emulator, too

[08:05] <psch> i had to drop out of uni though, so i don't think i'll continue it

[08:18] <brrt> asm is fun

[08:18] <FROGGS> so is pir

[08:19] <JimmyZ> pasm :)

[08:20] <jnthn> Don't give me nightmares :P

[08:21] <timotimo> brrt: ah, good news indeed. good news that you found it, in any case

[08:22] <brrt> the difference between PIR and real asm is that asm has viable implementations :-P

[08:22] <brrt> well, now i just have to figure out why, you know?

[08:22] <timotimo> yeah

[08:22] <brrt> and i'm under no illusion that this is the last one

[08:22] <timotimo> but it seems like you have somewhat of a golf

[08:23] <timotimo> i'm just not so happy dynasm keeps stealing so much of your time

[08:32] <jnthn> http://www.moarvm.org/releases/MoarVM-2015.08.tar.gz now in place

[09:26] <dalek> MoarVM: Make thread join force a GC run.

[09:26] <dalek> MoarVM:

[09:26] <dalek> MoarVM: Avoids sitting in a loop starting/joining threads gobbling resources

[09:26] <dalek> MoarVM: due to a GC never being triggered.

[12:36] <nwc10> o/

[12:36] <brrt> timotimo: don't worry about that, it's what i do :-)

[12:37] <brrt> i'm wondering, it's quite probably worth my while to enumerate all permissisble bytecode segments in dynasm

[12:38] <brrt> then compile it, make a dump, extract the information from objdump, and diff them

[12:38] <brrt> seems like a job for....

[12:38] <brrt> THE DUCT TAPE CALLED PERL (c)

[12:39] <timotimo> <3

[12:39] <timotimo> (yes, i am forbidding you from using perl4, perl5 or perl6. deal with it.)

[12:40] <brrt> why perl6?

[12:40] <brrt> then it's NQP for me :-P

[12:41] <timotimo> .o( just kidding )

[12:44] <psch> perl3 shoulda been forbidden too, no?

[12:44] <timotimo> indeed
