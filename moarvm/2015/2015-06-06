[20:17] <nwc10> jnthn: are all your lazy deserialisation fixes in? ie, there are no known bugs left?

[20:17] <jnthn> nwc10: Yes

[20:17] <nwc10> OK, thanks.

[20:17] <jnthn> Well, no lazy deserialization race bugs at least. :)

[20:17] <nwc10> will play further, when I'm not alseep

[20:17] <nwc10> OK. Sleep well

[20:17] <jnthn> We know there's some pre-comp issues though those are oftne not actually the serialization code's fault in general.

[20:18] <jnthn> Anyway, o/
