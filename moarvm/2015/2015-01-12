[18:27] <arnsholt> Moar hackers: For your Moar hackery, do you have parallel MoarVM and nqp directories? If so, does nqp/Configure.pl --with-moar=... work for you?

[18:31] <jnthn> arnsholt: I normally configure my NQP with --backend=moar --prefix=/path/to/moar/install

[18:31] <arnsholt> That makes sense, yeah!

[18:31] <arnsholt> Cheers!
