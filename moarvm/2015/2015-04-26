[16:49] <jepeway> anybody seen RT #124391 ?

[16:49] <synbot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=124391

[17:06] <jepeway> it's a use-after-free bug, where an error message refers to a free()d file name.

[19:21] *** zakharyas joined

[19:36] <jnthn> Can just toss the free for now

[19:37] <jnthn> It leaks, but that problem exists across the codebase on all such exception paths.

[19:46] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix use-after-free in open file error reporting.

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM: Fix thinko in integration of UTF-8 decode and NFG.

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM:

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM: We need to increment the number of bytes we accepted even if it we

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM: don't end up with a grapheme from them; otherwise, we can end up with

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM: them being put into the normalizer's buffer twice.

[21:03] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6ef0f8f519
