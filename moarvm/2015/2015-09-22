[17:08] <hoelzro> if an async task being executed needs to delay its execution even further, is it safe to put a new async task on the queue?

[17:08] <hoelzro> I guess what I mean to ask is if it's ok for the async thread to push something to the async queue, or if the queue will block when full and the async thread will deadlock itself

[17:09] <japhb> hoelzro: Two answers: 1. It should be.  2. It has historically been a problem when the task queue is longer than the thread pool is large

[17:09] <japhb> I believe the latter is considered pure bug

[17:10] <hoelzro> hmm =/

[18:04] <patrickz> libuv has moved their repository. https://github.com/joyent/libuv.git -> https://github.com/libuv/libuv I think that should be updated in .gitmodules (currently on wrong OS, thus can't create a PR or issue...)
