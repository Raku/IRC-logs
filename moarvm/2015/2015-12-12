[18:11] *** [Coke] joined
[18:15] <jnthn> nwc10: Ended up doing chili con carne. :) I'm missing ingredients for most of the curries I tend to do, and didn't fancy the trek to the bigger store that sells them.

[18:22] <timotimo> jnthn: where in Array.pm do i put the AT-POS for multidimref_*? there's a ShapedArray and a TypedArray; maybe i'll have to add another role that does "only" the AT-POS that returns the reference and have that in three different versions for each register type

[18:23] <jnthn> You don't

[18:23] <jnthn> Array.pm is not native

[18:24] <jnthn> It's only AT-POS in native_array.pm's shaped role that'd need it

[18:25] <timotimo> oh!

[18:25] <timotimo> perfect

[18:25] <timotimo> that's probably a bit easier

[18:26] <timotimo> especially since it already has the three roles

[18:29] <timotimo> jnthn: did it even make sense that i made a multidim reference for Str?

[18:31] <timotimo> hm. i'll prolly have to fudge out the multidim refs for jvm

[18:31] <timotimo> and the usage there, too

[18:40] <jnthn> timotimo: Yeah, I can imagine us supporting my str @arr some day

[18:41] <timotimo> it's not quite "packed" then, though?

[18:41] <jnthn> Yeah :)

[18:41] <jnthn> But it's the kind of thing join maybe uses to be a bit smarter

[18:42] <jnthn> And similar things

[18:42] <timotimo> mhm

[18:42] <jnthn> So I can see we may want it from a "Perl 6 in Perl 6" perspective

[18:54] <timotimo> timo@schmetterling ~/p/rakudo (nom)> perl6 -e 'my int @foo[2;2]; @foo[1;1]++; say @foo'

[18:55] <dalek> MoarVM/multidim_references: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b804b1399c

[18:55] <timotimo> i think i can merge this branch into moar now

[18:57] <nwc10> does it pass spectest?

[18:58] <timotimo> should i try with or without the additional nqp and rakudo patches?

[18:58] <nwc10> I don't know enough about the branch to know the answer to that.

[18:59] <jnthn> Just test the bunch together to make sure no regressions

[18:59] <timotimo> right

[18:59] <jnthn> I can have a look, but my chili just reached the point of nommability :)

[18:59] <jnthn> so bbi20 or so :)

[18:59] <timotimo> the moar branch adds alternative code paths, doesn't really change existing ones

[19:00] * timotimo specs tests

[19:16] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/48fadfb2da0ff6c840a8 - does that look regression-free to you?

[19:18] <nwc10> I don't recognise the failure for /spec/S32-array/adverbs.t

[19:40] * jnthn back

[19:41] <timotimo> welcome back, jnthn

[19:41] <timotimo> i went ahead and merged in moar and bumped nqp

[19:41] <timotimo> and nqp now maps the ops, too

[19:41] <timotimo> i have a commit ready to be pushed in rakudo

[19:46] <jnthn> +        MVM_ASSIGN_REF(tc, &(ref->common.header), ref->body.u.multidim.obj, obj);

[19:46] <jnthn> +        ref->body.u.multidim.indices = indices;

[19:46] <timotimo> oh, i didn't copy-paste that line?

[19:46] <jnthn> Second one should be MVM_ASSIGN_REF too

[19:46] <timotimo> i swear i did! :)

[19:46] <timotimo> i mean ... obviously not

[19:46] <timotimo> will fix

[19:48] <timotimo> i guess i confused myself ... i duplicated the MVMROOT and perhaps my brain thought that'd be enough for both things

[19:48] <timotimo> jnthn++

[19:50] <jnthn> Don't see anything else in the Moar patches

[19:50] <jnthn> NQP one is fine too

[19:51] <timotimo> great! i'll bump again in nqp and fixup the pending rakudo commit

[19:53] <timotimo> whew. i finally did something actually productive again

[19:54] <timotimo> badly needed that.

[19:54] <timotimo> then i should also write some spec tests

[19:55] <jnthn> :)

[19:55] <timotimo> tonight is a celebration-like eventy thingie

[19:55] <jnthn> timotimo++

[19:55] <timotimo> but it's the kind where bringing your laptop and hacking will be acceptable

[19:55] <jnthn> Sounds nice :)

[19:56] <timotimo> yup. it takes place in the local hackerspace

[19:56] <timotimo> hitting the road soon
