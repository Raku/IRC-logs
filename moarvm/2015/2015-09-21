[08:05] <brrt> good *

[08:22] <brrt> hmm

[08:22] <brrt> i have more new plans

[08:46] <brrt> basically, it seems that the reason we crash at elems is that a wholly different piece of code seems to be inserted into the fragment

[08:47] <brrt> and i don't know why that happens

[08:47] <brrt> so my plan is to move forward with the linearisation of tiles

[08:47] <brrt> i.e. during tiling we build a linear array of output tiles interleaved with 'pseudotiles'

[08:48] <brrt> pseudotiles are basically the magic pieces of code that are inserted during the compilation

[08:49] <brrt> it has the advantage that it

[08:49] <brrt> will be very easy to predict the linear code sequence from the linear tile sequence

[11:31] * timotimo backlogs

[11:31] <timotimo> ah, so perhaps there's some kind of bug in the tile selection process or something

[11:31] <timotimo> and that causes unexpected code to be plopped into the result

[11:31] <timotimo> i guess that seems plausible
