[18:36] <timotimo> ohai brrt

[18:36] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[18:37] <brrt> back from ccc?

[18:37] <timotimo> yeah, i've returned on thursday or so

[18:37] <timotimo> um, no, that's not right

[18:37] <timotimo> monday night actually

[18:39] <brrt> ah, ok, was it fun?

[18:39] <timotimo> oh yes

[18:40] <timotimo> but also strenuous and the camping aspect was sometimes annoying :)

[18:40] <timotimo> and - just like every other chaos event i attend - i didn't approach and get to know enough cool people

[18:41] <brrt> we can choose to interpret the 'enough' there in any which way

[18:41] <brrt> there may just have been too many cool people

[18:41] <brrt> :-)

[18:41] <timotimo> that's right

[18:45] <brrt> cool

[18:45] <brrt> i've never been to such an event

[18:46] <timotimo> you're missing out :)

[18:46] <timotimo> i also miss out, but you miss out even more!

[18:46] <timotimo> :)

[18:47] <timotimo> media.ccc.de has lots and lots of recordings of talks

[18:48] *** zakharyas joined
[18:48] <brrt> i miss out on a lot of things

[18:48] <brrt> thats how life goes :-)

[18:52] <timotimo> aye, it is

[18:59] <brrt> hmmm

[19:00] <brrt> the condition of an IF/WHEN block is actually nonconditional. unless it is a short-circuiting operation

[19:00] <brrt> which means..

[19:00] <brrt> which means i'm not quite sure where to place the necessary spills and stores

[19:01] <brrt> hmm, i wish i had taken my notebook with me

[19:10] <brrt> hmmm
