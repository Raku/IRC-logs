[01:46] <orbus> greetings moarvm folks

[01:46] <orbus> was curious if anyone knows what the current status of moar on sparc is

[01:46] <orbus> I spent some time last week getting it to build on solaris 10, which I finally got it to

[01:46] <orbus> but it dumps core when I try to build nqp

[01:46] <orbus> I had to build a newer gcc to build moar, and I'm thinking the gcc build may be no good - but figured I'd come ask if this *should* work, or if it's a no-go regardless

[01:48] *** ilbot3 joined
[02:46] <TEttinger> orbus, I think it's a little sleepy in here right now. that sounds like an impressive amount of work you've put in though, I imagine there's a way to make it work

[02:47] <orbus> no worries - I can ask later

[02:47] <orbus> I've been working on it off and on

[02:47] <orbus> aside from building gcc, it was mostly just getting the right CFLAGS to get it to build on solaris 10

[02:47] <TEttinger> the only experience I have with sparc is with a bunch of ancient Sun Netra X1 servers that my brother's college threw out from the lab and he salvaged

[02:47] <orbus> there was one minor patch needed in libuv

[02:47] <TEttinger> (and they can't even run Solaris 10)

[02:48] <TEttinger> I ended up running Debian on them

[02:48] <TEttinger> learning how to netboot, crazy stuff for a CS novice

[02:48] <TEttinger> sold most of em for cheap on ebay.

[02:49] <orbus> yup, there's lots of old sparc hardware on ebay

[02:49] <TEttinger> it does sell for considerably more than old x86

[02:50] <orbus> it probably cost 10x as much when new too

[02:50] <TEttinger> I'm curious if it could actually be a solaris bug and not a sparc-related bug

[02:50] <TEttinger> gcc on solaris might have some differences?

[02:50] <orbus> don't know - it looked like there had been some work on solaris 11

[02:50] <orbus> well

[02:51] <TEttinger> I know there used to be differences between make on solaris and on GNU/Linux

[02:51] <orbus> yeah, there's sun make and gnu make

[02:51] <orbus> sun make doesn't work at all

[02:52] <orbus> for lots of open source software

[02:52] <TEttinger> haha, that's exactly what I gathered from just googling anything related to building on solaris :)

[02:52] <orbus> as for gcc, solaris 10 has gcc 3.4.3 as an optional package

[02:53] <TEttinger> hm, is that rather old?

[02:53] <orbus> yeah, latest is 5.2.something

[02:53] <orbus> moar has some built-ins that were added in gcc 4

[02:53] <orbus> or rather needs some built-ins

[02:53] <orbus> that's why I had to build gcc

[02:54] <TEttinger> November 4, 2004

[02:54] <TEttinger> wow, that sounds a lot older than solaris 10

[02:54] <orbus> but there's some notes I saw in the gcc docs after I did the build that make me think maybe I got a bad build

[02:54] <orbus> well, gcc isn't their primary compiler

[02:54] <TEttinger> yeah, there's the sun studio one?

[02:54] <orbus> right

[02:54] *** JimmyZ_ joined
[02:55] <orbus> but that's $$

[02:55] <TEttinger> mm.

[02:55] <orbus> anyway, there were notes about needing to use specific versions of some of the library dependencies otherwise Bad Things happen

[02:55] <orbus> so I might try again later

[02:56] <orbus> was just curious if there was some known breakage on sparc

[02:56] <JimmyZ_> we are fine to run on more cpus, though the libuv patch needs to go to the upstream .

[02:56] <orbus> I figured

[02:57] <orbus> it's basically just they're using cfmakeraw for some tty stuff

[02:57] <orbus> which solaris 10 doesn't have

[02:57] <orbus> the equivalent tty settings that cfmakeraw sets are actually in the cfmakeraw man page on linux haha

[02:58] <orbus> other than that it was all CFLAGS

[02:58] <orbus> needed to set various defines to get it to build

[02:58] <orbus> and of course it doesn't work yet

[03:02] * JimmyZ_ didn't use solaris at allðŸ˜Š

[03:02] <orbus> I use it at work

[03:03] <orbus> and it would be nice if perl6 worked there someday

[03:03] <orbus> so I've just been tinkering with it

[03:03] <JimmyZ_> yeah

[03:03] <orbus> jvm works but it's slooooow

[03:03] <orbus> Hello, World takes like 5 seconds to run

[03:03] <JimmyZ_> only if moarvm builds on it

[03:04] <orbus> right, well that's the first hurdle

[03:04] <orbus> it does build

[03:04] <orbus> and like, I can get moar to output the help message

[03:04] <orbus> but when I tried to build nqp it dumps core

[03:04] <orbus> so something's not right

[03:04] <orbus> I still suspect my gcc build

[03:04] <JimmyZ_> yeah

[03:05] <orbus> newer versions of gcc need like libmpc and a couple other libraries

[03:05] <orbus> and there were notes on the gcc site about those mis-compiling with older versions of gcc

[03:06] <orbus> and I had just grabbed the latest ones

[03:06] <orbus> so they may be silently broken

[03:06] <JimmyZ_> Is it big endian?

[03:06] <orbus> yes

[03:06] <orbus> I saw the bug note out on github

[03:06] <orbus> about big-endian brokenness

[03:06] <orbus> but I saw some stuff in the irc logs suggesting that's fixed now

[03:07] <orbus> would have to ask jnthn I guess?

[03:07] <orbus> that's one of the reasons I stopped by the channel

[03:08] <JimmyZ_> not sure whether moarvm works well enough on big endian or not

[03:08] <orbus> yeah

[03:08] <orbus> well it's all good

[03:08] <orbus> hopefully it will work eventually, and if I can help make that happen all the better

[03:08] <JimmyZ_> but we do have some code in moarvm to support it.

[03:09] <orbus> cool

[03:09] <orbus> I think I'll re-build gcc when I have time, see if that improves the situation

[03:10] <orbus> I might try an older version

[03:10] <orbus> I think anything over 4.0 will work

[03:12] <orbus> oh

[03:15] <orbus> hmm, yeah, think I will have to try this again

[03:18] <orbus> for posterity, the CFLAGS I needed to set for the build were -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=32 -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -DSUNOS_NO_IFADDRS -DAO_USE_PTHREAD_DEFS

[03:19] <orbus> notes I made:

[03:19] <orbus> _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=32 is needed for libelf.h, which doesn't support 64 bit offsets on 32 bit compiles

[03:19] <orbus> _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS needed for readdir_r arguments

[03:19] <orbus> SUNOS_NO_IFADDRS needed for libuv because Solaris 10 doesn't have ifaddrs.h

[03:19] <orbus> AO_USE_PTHREAD_DEFS needed for libatomic_ops because we get missing symbols otherwise

[03:20] <orbus> I tried to do a 64 bit build and more stuff broke

[03:20] <orbus> didn't push forward on that

[03:20] <orbus> solaris supports both 32 and 64 bit, but most userland stuff is 32 bit

[03:24] <JimmyZ_> so how can they use more memory on 32 bit...

[03:26] <orbus> I think most big software packages (oracle, etc.) tend to be 64 bit

[03:26] <orbus> it's just like ls, grep, all that stuff ships 32 bit

[13:17] <FROGGS> hi brrt

[13:17] <FROGGS> brrt: how was your talk going?

[13:18] <brrt> it went well, actually, people said i was nervous, which i was

[13:18] <brrt> but also that they understood what i was talking about

[13:18] <brrt> which is kind of nice :-)

[13:27] <brrt> are you not at yapc::eu then?

[13:33] <FROGGS> no, I was unable to afford the time+money :o(

[13:39] <brrt> well, it's september alright, so i can imagine that

[13:41] <FROGGS> it is more that I can't leave my wife and kids at home for two workshops/conferences in a row

[13:42] <hoelzro> has anyone worked with pmurias at all to keep the js branch building with the MoarVM cross compiler? I'm trying to merge js & master in NQP, and I'm encountering issues that I believe are related to serialization format changes

[13:44] <brrt> not me, aactually

[14:19] <timotimo> no clue :|

[14:20] <brrt> \o timotimo

[14:20] <timotimo> can has slides? :)

[14:21] <brrt> oh, yes, where shall i put them?

[14:21] <timotimo> when i read you'll answer the question "will perl6 ever be fast" at the end of your abstract, i thought you'd pull a total jnthn and whip out benchmarks that show real-life perl6 code that does a 5x over perl5 or something :D

[14:22] <timotimo> i mean, we already do that for number-crunching with tight loops, but that's easy-peasy :P

[14:22] <timotimo> i don't care where the slides land :)

[14:28] <brrt> no, i haven't done that

[14:29] <brrt> i have no spot to place them actually.... maybe at github

[14:30] <brrt> nope, github doesn't allow it

[14:40] <timotimo> google drive?

[14:40] <timotimo> gimme a second

[14:41] <timotimo> hm, yeah, google drive is probably good

[14:41] <timotimo> then i can put it up on t.h8.lv for you

[14:47] <timotimo> and i suppse there's also space on www.p6c.org; dunno if it serves user's "public_html" directories

[14:47] <timotimo> even if not, you can upload it to hack and i'll pull it over onto t.h8.lv
