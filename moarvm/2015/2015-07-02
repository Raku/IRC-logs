[08:34] <JimmyZ> o/

[08:35] <brrt> the 'hard parts' of my little toy are finished :-)

[08:35] <JimmyZ> congratulations

[08:35] <brrt> it's not the compiler yet

[08:35] <brrt> unfortunately

[08:35] <brrt> although

[08:35] <masak> brrt: did you blog about progress recently? inquisitive minds are so curious!

[08:36] <masak> :)

[08:36] <brrt> as a means of demonstration, i aim to write a very simple codegenerator, that should be almost as good as you can do for a RISC machine

[08:36] <brrt> not yet masak :-) i was going to do that

[08:37] <brrt> but then my brain got stuck on this subproblem

[08:39] <masak> I know the feeling

[08:40] <masak> just remember that there's a market demand :>

[09:02] <brrt> Getopt::Long is a standard module, isn't it?

[09:04] <lizmat> in P5 yes, in P6 that would be called multi MAIN

[09:04] <brrt> ok, awesome

[09:08] <brrt> lizmat: could you perchance test the libuv-1.6.1-update branch

[09:08] <brrt> on a mac :-)

[09:24] <lizmat> brrt: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/cfa3c247f5b7928cef66

[09:25] <brrt> that's... weird

[09:25] <brrt> the 'reference is not a tree' bug

[09:26] <lizmat> same after make clean / distclean

[09:27] <lizmat> also after nuking the install dir

[09:28] <timotimo> hm, does "git submodule update" give an error?

[09:28] <timotimo> is that the right command?

[09:28] <lizmat> $ git submodule update

[09:28] <lizmat> fatal: reference is not a tree: 30c8be07bb78a66fdee5141626bf53a49a17094a

[09:28] <lizmat> Unable to checkout '30c8be07bb78a66fdee5141626bf53a49a17094a' in submodule path '3rdparty/libuv'

[09:28] <brrt> it is *really* weird. doesn't happen when I'm using a clean source directory

[09:28] <brrt> but it is very much a commit

[09:29] <timotimo> isn't update supposed to do a fetch first?

[09:29] <timotimo> that gives no output whatsoever?

[09:29] <nwc10> lizmat: at a guess, you need to edit 3rdparty/libuv/.git/config

[09:29] <timotimo> in any case, cd 3rdparty/libuv; git fetch  - should help?

[09:29] <nwc10> url = https://github.com/libuv/libuv.git

[09:29] <nwc10> because that's what I needed to do yesterday.

[09:30] <timotimo> oh, i thought we had our own repository on github for libuv

[09:30] <brrt> isn't that handled by the branch

[09:30] <timotimo> maybe "git submodule sync" helps?

[09:30] <brrt> oh, yes

[09:30] <brrt> git submodule sync

[09:30] <timotimo> that could perhaps go into the configure.pl script

[09:30] <brrt> should *probably* be aprt of Configure.pl

[09:30] * brrt nods

[09:30] <lizmat> Configuration SUCCESS

[09:30] <lizmat> so yes

[09:31] <lizmat> make is successful

[09:52] <brrt> i'm thinking of making the sizeof / offsetoff thing a more generic construct

[09:52] <brrt> maybe something like (&foo 3 4) always translating into foo(1,2)

[09:52] <brrt> then we can add in whatever macros we like (as long as they can be calculated at compile time :-))

[09:57] <brrt> does \w match _

[09:57] <brrt> yes, it does

[10:18] <jnthn> Anyone here seen or understand https://gist.github.com/virtualsue/0b757b139f3946c2515e ?

[10:18] <jnthn> Something to do with the recent dyncall/libffi thing?

[10:20] <timotimo> huh? i think that's stuff froggs recently introduced

[10:20] <timotimo> the leading underscores are probably put in by clang?

[10:25] <jnthn> Looks like lack of re-configure...

[10:27] <timotimo> aye

[10:27] <timotimo> i re-configure regularly to mae sure nqp's and rakudo's configure scripts are happy with the versions

[11:24] *** brrt joined
[11:24] <brrt> no, haven't seen it before

[11:29] <timotimo> brrt: it was because new files were added

[11:29] <timotimo> when froggs split nativecall into dyncall and libffi versions

[11:30] <brrt> hmm, on master i guess?

[11:30] <brrt> i'm a bit behind :-)

[11:30] <brrt> oh, i see

[11:31] <brrt> yes

[11:31] <brrt> y'all need to reconfigure more often :-)

[11:31] <timotimo> not me, and not jnthn ;)

[12:12] <brrt> also so hot anywhere else?

[12:16] <jnthn> brrt: It's on its way to being here

[12:16] <jnthn> Today is plenty hot enough...tomorrow will be worse.

[12:21] <brrt> remind me to plan a *winter* of code next time

[12:21] <brrt> saturday will be the hottest day in nl

[12:34] <jnthn> urgh

[12:34] <jnthn> It seems the hot is moving west to east

[12:34] <jnthn> So I didn't get the full force of it yet

[12:41] <jnthn> Should have airco for a week starting on Sat

[12:46] <brrt> i have fan and a garden spray :-)

[12:47] <brrt> unfortunately, that doesn't work very well for laptops

[12:48] <jnthn> Uh, no, it won't

[12:49] <jnthn> If you make your compile cycle long enough you can go cool off while compiling :P

[18:57] *** brrt joined
[19:02] <timotimo> you know, i think i really ought to build a tool that you can just paste some text into that contains file:lineno and whenever it sees interp.c:$n it figures out what the op is

[19:19] <timotimo> check this out, nwc10, jnthn: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/491792

[19:21] <timotimo> i'm also positively surprised by how quick that script runs

[19:30] <brrt> so, bridge is closing, but hangs open

[19:30] <timotimo> it failed to close properly?

[19:30] <brrt> yes

[19:30] <timotimo> damn

[19:30] <timotimo> and the signals failed to notice

[19:30] <brrt> and the motorist just ... drives into it

[19:30] <brrt> how does that even happen?

[19:31] <timotimo> that's the kind of bridge that just has one static part in the middle that goes up and down?

[19:31] <jnthn> fail

[19:32] <brrt> yes, that kind of bridge

[19:35] <brrt> a suspension bridge is i think the english name for it

[19:36] <jnthn> Yeah, you're supposed to suspend your driving before reaching it, when it's open... :P
