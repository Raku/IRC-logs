[07:49] <brrt> uhm, i have two more questions regarding my hague-grant-application

[07:50] <brrt> one: suppose my requested amount exceeds what is available, that doesn't mean automatic denial, right?

[07:51] <brrt> two: if i ask considerable less than the nominal maximum (which i've seen no-one do in earlier hague grants), does that come off like i don't know what i'm doing?

[07:51] <brrt> i feel like it might

[08:33] <nwc10> brrt: I assume that it doesn't mean "automatic denial" because there are other funds. But if so, it would need the TPF board to decide to allocate them

[08:33] <brrt> ok, right.

[08:33] <nwc10> (if it excedes all of TPF's unassigned money, you are straight out of luck)

[08:33] <brrt> well, the thing is this

[08:34] <nwc10> I don't know, and you may not want to say this on a logged channel

[08:34] <brrt> i can live with less than the total nominal amount. i did just fine with that last year

[08:34] <brrt> right

[08:34] <nwc10> you are, however, a student currently, and I assume making student-like trade offs with your cost of living

[08:36] <nwc10> I hope you're not planning to be a student forever :-)(

[08:36] <nwc10> I really should give up today

[08:37] <nwc10> there's something massively wrong with my typing

[08:37] * nwc10 goes to the coffee machine

[08:37] <brrt> i will probably be a student only for this and the next academic year

[08:42] <brrt> and next academic year will be spent writing theses :-)

[09:12] <brrt> btw, i did finally figure out how to deal with jit-to-jit calls

[09:12] <brrt> the inter-jit calls can be very funky

[12:49] <timotimo> funky

[12:49] <timotimo> so ... i was wondering

[12:50] <timotimo> do we perhaps need some mechanism that waits with speshing frames that refer to other frames so that we have maximum chance of inlining?

[14:53] *** Ven joined
[16:15] *** brrt joined
[16:33] <brrt> \o

[16:33] <brrt> if you're going to do that, why not go all the way to tracing

[16:34] <timotimo> hmm, right

[16:34] <timotimo> we've already got that planned anyway

[16:36] <brrt> :-)

[16:36] <brrt> many plans

[16:37] <timotimo> indeed

[16:37] <timotimo> many exciting things on the horizon

[16:39] <jnthn> Drive by comment (heading to dinner very soon), but...

[16:40] <jnthn> We already 1) have small frames (those that are small enough to inline) have the lowest threshold, and 2) we spesh as we return down the call stack, meaning that we'll often have hit the callee and specialized it prior to specializing the inliner.

[16:40] <jnthn> That's why it hangs off exit

[16:41] <timotimo> oh, that's a neat trick

[16:41] <timotimo> i hadn't realized that

[16:41] <timotimo> very cool :)

[16:41] <jnthn> yes, I was happy when I came up with that

[16:42] <timotimo> and now i'm happy, too

[16:42] <timotimo> have a nice dinner! :)

[16:48] <jnthn> Thanks!

[16:49] <jnthn> I did hack up a patch in a spare disconnected moment, but it still need spectest...and ERAVENOUS, so later or tomorrow :)

[17:04] <timotimo> and there's also still lots of multithreading/asynchrony stability things to find

[17:04] <timotimo> like searching for easter eggs

[17:05] *** FROGGS joined
[18:07] <[Coke]> ... easter eggs. I am going to eat sooo many boiled eggs this weekend...

[18:08] <nwc10> I expect I'm going to eat quite a few yolks. E only really likes the whites

[18:19] * TimToady is only allowed to eat the yolks

[18:26] * TimToady is also supposedly allergic to the yolks according to the skin test, but doesn't seem to be so when eating them

[18:36] <[Coke]> well, there is a difference between eating them and rolling in them. :)

[18:37] * TimToady has never rolled in egg batter, to his knowledge

[18:37] <FROGGS> ... yet

[18:38] <masak> I would advise not doing that if the skin test triggers on it

[18:40] <TimToady> unlikely to be a problem, since the epidermis is largely impermeable to proteins without mechanical assistance

[18:41] <TimToady> and none of my allergies are terribly sensitive

[19:01] <masak> well, go ahead then. roll in egg batter. don't say I didn't warn you.

[21:14] <japhb> Would rolling the eggs between your skin and the floor be a form of mechanical assistance?

[21:15] <[Coke]> not for very long

[21:18] <TimToady> at least the yolk would not be on me
