[08:48] <arnsholt> FROGGS: IIRC structs should have the same alignment as the element with the strictest (that is, largest) alignment requirement

[08:50] <FROGGS> hmmm

[08:50] <FROGGS> makes sense I guess

[08:51] <FROGGS> that means we need to add and alignment property to MVMCStructREPRData

[09:00] <FROGGS> (and CUnion and CPPStruct)

[09:00] <arnsholt> Yup

[09:01] <FROGGS> testing now...

[09:15] <dalek> MoarVM: e8c92d5 | FROGGS++ | src/6model/reprs/C (6 files):

[09:15] <dalek> MoarVM: handle alignment of inlined structs/unions, arnsholt++

[09:15] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/e8c92d51fa

[09:15] <FROGGS> no regressions

[09:18] <arnsholt> Excellent. Pretty sure it's the spec-correct way to handle it

[09:22] <FROGGS> arnsholt: I am continuing to work on libxml2 anyway, so I'll probably notice if something is handled incorrectly

[09:22] <arnsholt> Very cool. Libxml is likely a very useful binding to have, too!

[09:22] <FROGGS> yeah, I need it :o)

[09:22] <FROGGS> (for $work)

[09:23] <FROGGS> then I "just" need to port stuff like XML::Compile

[09:23] <arnsholt> Yeah, libxml is more infrastructure than directly usable

[09:25] <FROGGS> I still hate xml anyway

[09:25] <FROGGS> but yuo can't get around it often enough sadly

[09:25] <FROGGS> you*

[09:26] <FROGGS> the good thing is that I usually forget that things are xml underneath... like when building b2b interfaces

[12:47] <[Coke]> moarvm release soon?

[13:31] *** FROGGS joined
[13:37] * timotimo will be AFK for a long time in a few

[13:38] <FROGGS> a long time?

[13:38] <FROGGS> :S

[13:40] <timotimo> uh

[13:40] <timotimo> just multiple hours

[13:44] <FROGGS> phew

[13:44] <FROGGS> :o)

[13:45] <FROGGS> so it is more like C long (seconds) instead of bigint long

[14:10] *** FROGGS_ joined
[14:44] <TimToady> .oO(a century is multiple hours)

[14:51] *** tokuhiro_ joined
[15:02] <timotimo> I'll be back before Christmas

[15:14] <japhb> I notice you didn't say what year ...

[16:53] *** hoelzro joined
[16:58] <FROGGS> :D

[17:32] <timotimo> japhb what say you? push the p6-only benchmarks?

[18:11] <japhb> timotimo: Yes, sorry, noticed you'd asked about that, and I hadn't gotten a chance to reply yet

[18:12] <japhb> timotimo: It's perfectly OK to make language-specific benchmarks, especially if the thing you're testing doesn't make much sense in the other languages (e.g. variations of flattening behavior in NQP)

[18:14] <japhb> timotimo: Also, ISTR you were complaining about time taken to run the tests.  Remember that there are several kinds of filtering available to decide which tests to run.  You can easily choose a selection of test tags to run, instead of all of them -- and you can tune down the run counts and such to get faster total testing time.

[18:48] * [Coke] wonders if there's anything we can do to speed up running profile.htmls

[19:36] <brrt> what dynasm does with the mrm-byte-marking is weird

[19:37] <brrt> incomprehensibly weird

[19:43] <FROGGS> :/

[19:50] <[Coke]> profile call graph page taking 2.3G of memory in chrome and 112.1% of cpu.

[19:51] <timotimo> ugh

[19:51] <timotimo> and our QJson we use for the qt profiler capitulates at a surprisingly low file size, too

[19:52] <brrt> wow

[19:52] <[Coke]> been trying to show me that page for minutes now.

[19:53] <brrt> my suspicion is that this bit was always broken with regards to variable registers

[19:54] <brrt> AAAARGH

[19:54] <FROGGS> ó.ò

[19:55] <[Coke]> 2.9GB...

[19:55] *** vendethiel joined
[19:55] <brrt> that's actually quite small

[19:56] <[Coke]> brrt: was that to me?

[19:58] *** tokuhiro_ joined
[20:10] <brrt> no, that was to dynasm

[20:24] <japhb> timotimo: Perhaps then the answer is to reorder the tests, so you can get "canary data" quickly.  Remember that you can split up your timing into multiple timeall runs (`bench time`), and analyse all the collected benchmark data together as a pool.

[20:26] <japhb> timotimo: So you can tag (or otherwise select) a small subset of the tests to run first, and the inverse to run second.  Then as soon as the first timing run is complete, you can analyze it while you spawn off the remainder to collect all the "less important" test info, and finally analyze the whole batch.

[20:30] <brrt> it seems i have some success....

[20:31] <timotimo> brrt: glad to hear it!

[20:32] *** colomon joined
[20:41] <brrt> dalek won't report on it, so: https://github.com/MoarVM/dynasm/commit/a31bc2289096c1b717bf4e761ae43ad5842b9878

[20:42] <brrt> https://github.com/bdw/lab/blob/master/c/dasm/example.dasc and this test case is now handled correctly

[20:42] <brrt> i'm ... reasonably confident this is reasonably less brittle

[20:43] <brrt> the original dynasm modrm dance was insanity itself

[20:44] <FROGGS> brrt: what you are doing is scary :o)

[20:47] * brrt is mad

[20:47] <brrt> i have reported on this before i started

[20:47] <FROGGS> aye

[20:48] <timotimo> Exercise 4-12. Adapt the ideas of Cthulhu() to write a recursive version of the Forbidden Song of Hali; that is, to unravel the fibres of reality and allow the icy liquid darkness of Carcosa to devour your mind.

[20:48] <timotimo> Exercise 4-13. Write a function reverse(s) which reverses the string s by turning the mind inside out, converting madness into reality and opening the door to allow the Old Ones to creep forth once more from their sunken crypt beyond time.

[20:53] <timotimo> :)

[20:53] * psch missed the opportunity to bring in an exercise 4.bleemteen :/

[20:54] <psch> woulda fit with all the madness :P

[20:55] <timotimo> i don't know what that is a reference to :|

[20:56] <psch> pretty good story

[20:56] <psch> not amazing, but good
