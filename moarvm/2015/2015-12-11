[10:41] <brrt> unfortunately, the strategy for string-to-number conversion has alll but changed in lua 5.3 vs lua 5.1

[10:42] <brrt> there is apprantly a way to push solaris libc into doing the right thing... but how?

[20:52] <cygx> ENOBRRT, so I left a comment at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/306#issuecomment-164044633

[20:53] <cygx> brrt: ^

[20:54] <konobi> howdy

[20:54] <konobi> cygx: that'd be the issue I filed

[20:54] <cygx> konobi: added another comment

[20:55] <konobi> cool

[20:55] <jnthn> cygx++ konobi++

[20:57] <konobi> yeah, i couldn't work out how that all worked

[20:59] <cygx> perl Configure.pl --help, --os <=> %OS_*, --toolchain <=> %TC_*, --compiler <=> %COMPILERS

[20:59] <cygx> let's just hope that toolchain options can overwrite compiler ones ;)

[23:19] <timotimo> jnthn: is there any reason to put MVMObject * for the indices instead of MVMArray?

[23:20] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes

[23:20] <jnthn> timotimo: You already have it from the op

[23:20] <jnthn> And we don't know it'll be an MVMArray

[23:21] <jnthn> You could get a fixed dimension set of them
