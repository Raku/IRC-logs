[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: Force SC initialization to allocate in gen2.

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: For the same reason as the initialization earlier on in the code.

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: Fixes a deadlock on POSIX platforms.

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7e1b5a4f88

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: 469ba64 | jnthn++ | src/gc/allocation.c:

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: Add a sanity check for gen2 allocation flag.

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM:

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: Don't seem to violate this anywhere yet, but it might save some quite

[12:38] <dalek> MoarVM: painful debugging in the future.

[18:11] <timotimo> where did that piece of code go that triggers early GC runs when malloc has been used for a lot of memory?

[18:12] <timotimo> ~apparently it's in a branch and has not yet been merged

[18:15] <timotimo> i'll have to fix it up a bit and bring it up to date with our latest code

[19:00] <brrt> good * #moarvm

[19:01] <diakopter> brrt: got some jit building warnings with VS 2015 (msvc 14)

[19:02] <brrt> alright. can you send me a log

[19:03] <brrt> you mean on even-moar-jit

[19:03] <diakopter> no, master

[19:03] <brrt> oh... or a gist

[19:03] <diakopter> also, disabling the JIT is the only way to get rakudo to build

[19:04] <diakopter> (maybe related to the warnings, maybe not)

[19:05] <brrt> really? on windows/master

[19:05] <diakopter> yes

[19:06] <diakopter> but windows 10 (1115, which is the latest service pack, with latest visual studio)

[19:06] <brrt> i dont have a vm handy...

[19:06] <brrt> well that should just work really

[19:06] <diakopter> jnthn uses a version back on each, afaik

[19:07] <brrt> hmmm... worrisome

[19:08] <brrt> ill try to get a win10 vm asap

[19:10] <diakopter> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a1fb5befd441e1bbd2fb

[19:11] <diakopter> brrt: I wouldn't worry about it, frankly

[19:11] <brrt> well, i do :-)

[19:11] <brrt> it's what i do

[19:12] <brrt> strange.... the shift error

[19:12] *** dalek joined
[19:13] *** kjs_ joined
[19:15] <brrt> seems plausible. but i'll have to check tomorrow at earliest

[19:16] *** dalek joined
[19:26] <diakopter> brrt: I suppose it's possible it's compiling for 32-bit somehow

[19:26] <brrt> ....

[19:26] <brrt> yes that ... is possible

[19:27] <brrt> can you upload the generated makefile and/or config.h?

[19:28] <brrt> that would maybe mean a configure.pl fix

[19:30] <diakopter> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0bb89b9316c4a9afb2f8

[19:37] <brrt> that doesnt look obviously wrong

[19:42] <brrt> :-(

[19:51] <diakopter> I can't correlate those warning line numbers to any >>

[19:53] <brrt> no.... weird

[20:02] <brrt> currently downloading win10 enterprise at a lightnimg 17kb/s

[20:03] <diakopter> just don't

[20:03] <diakopter> srsly

[20:13] <diakopter> brrt: I'm sure the version of Visual studio is more relevant than version of Windows

[20:14] <brrt> oh but vs2015 isnt small either :-)

[20:15] <brrt> i'll have to check it out later

[20:15] <brrt> thanks for letting me know

[20:16] <diakopter> I mean, I should probably try a prior VS version

[20:17] <brrt> see you
