[03:23] <retupmoca> "80a3d072354d25f2e3a558e23abd9fb1c77fcac4 is the first bad commit"

[03:30] <[Coke]> that doesn't seem to be a moarvm sha

[03:31] <[Coke]> ah, it's a rakudo sha, with no moarvm changes or C code... weird.

[03:32] <retupmoca> yeah, rakudo sha

[03:49] <[Coke]> what command is causing the failure?

[04:07] <retupmoca> it happens during stage parse of the CORE.setting

[04:07] <retupmoca> after running for a while

[04:08] <retupmoca> (actual typed command is just 'nmake')

[04:08] <retupmoca> I may have to finally learn the VS debugger and try to get a backtrace
