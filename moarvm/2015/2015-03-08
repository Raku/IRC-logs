[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM: fix system detection in triple for cross compilation

[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM: the scheme for triple is `<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>`, so the `sys` is not the last part.

[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM:

[17:47] <dalek> MoarVM: see http://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html as reference.

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp: stop fiddling with slashes after whitespace in openpipe

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp:

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp: We do that already for windows in op shell, so let's do that

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp: for openpipe too. This is if course icky because the whitespace

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp: could be part of the path of the executable and therefore might

[20:31] <dalek> MoarVM/cpp: be quoted, but let's keep the code simple for now.
