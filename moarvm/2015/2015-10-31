[18:49] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Names are shamelessly taken from LISP. Doesn't seem to introduce

[18:49] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: new errors, which is something at least. Simplifies many templates

[18:49] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: tremendously.

[20:50] <nwc10> jnthn: IIRC you said that one of the advantages of updating the bytecode to be able to store literal strings as either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, was that for the latter one knows it has to be NFG already, so no need to process it

[20:51] <nwc10> that's no longer true now is it, for any string containing "\r\n" ?

[20:51] <nwc10> if so, would the simplest fix be for the serialiser to always serialise strings containing \r\n as UTF-8, so that they go through the NFG input routines, even if the string is in the ISO-8859-1 range
