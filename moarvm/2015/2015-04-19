[00:19] <timotimo> wow

[00:19] <timotimo> i got some passing tests

[00:19] <timotimo> this is incredible

[00:19] <timotimo> and such a simple mistake, too

[00:20] <timotimo> ok 1 - localref of type int with value 23 assigned to it

[00:20] <timotimo> ok 2 - localref of type num with value 99e2 assigned to it

[00:20] <timotimo> ok 3 - localref of type str with a value assigned to it

[00:22] <timotimo> now i'll just have to write more tests to also cover lexicalrefs and make sure they work, too

[00:22] <timotimo> at least in that direction

[00:23] <timotimo> i probably also have to test the other direction

[00:23] <timotimo> not 100% sure what the tests'll look like ... first i'd have a local set to some value, grab a localref from the local and access it as if it were a regular local again?

[00:23] <timotimo> anyway. sleep first.

[00:25] <timotimo> i pushed it to a branch "mast_localref_2" which is rebased on recent work, but dalek didn't report anything

[06:46] <nwc10> jnthn: I think that I've found it. deserialize_method_cache_lazy() is cruel and unforgiving

[10:38] <timotimo> found what exactly?

[10:39] <nwc10> why changing the size of stored strings made a lot more CPU work on startup

[10:40] <timotimo> oh?

[10:40] <timotimo> "the size of stored strings"?

[21:36] <[Coke]> t/spec/S17-procasync/kill.t is passing, but slow. Any reason not to add it to spectest.data ?

[21:39] <[Coke]> wrong window.
