[11:37] <brrt> good *

[11:39] <brrt> who can help me find motivation for the latest JIT bug

[11:44] <brrt> i only ever seem to make things worse :-(

[11:52] <lizmat> brrt o/

[11:52] <brrt> \o lizmat

[11:53] <lizmat> we still have MoarVM tuits, we could send you some

[11:53] <lizmat> ?

[11:53] <brrt> :-)

[11:53] <brrt> well, yeah

[11:54] <brrt> how good are you with debugging :-P

[11:54] <brrt> i'm .. fairly sure i'm just missing something in a systematic way

[11:54] <lizmat> if you have a gist I could look at ?

[11:55] <lizmat> I'd be willing to have a look, and others maybe as well ?

[11:55] <brrt> that's the thing. then i'd have to bring it down into  a small bite-size thing

[11:55] <brrt> i don't know how to do that yet

[11:55] <lizmat> and/or try to explain the problem in a gist, maybe that in itself will be helpful ?

[11:55] <brrt> well, maybe it'll help just to write it down

[11:56] <lizmat> my point exactly  :-)

[11:56] <lizmat> get some distance between you and the bug  :-)

[11:58] <brrt> will do

[11:59] <brrt> there's also this thing about my thesis that's brinigng me down a bit

[11:59] <brrt> long story short, i promised too many things to too many people. and i'm not sure it works out

[11:59] <lizmat> learning to say no is part of growing up  :-)

[12:00] <brrt> hmm... yes

[12:00] <brrt> it's encouraging that you say that

[12:01] <lizmat> :-)

[12:02] <lizmat> if that means saying no to MoarVM work, then so be it: your thesis is more important!

[12:02] <lizmat> OTOH if you need work on MoarVM to do something different for a change, you're also very welcome to that  :)

[12:03] <lizmat> but you already knew that, right ?

[12:05] <brrt> i suppose so :-)

[12:05] <brrt> yeah, well, it's within my thesis that i promised too much things to too many people

[12:05] <brrt> who each want some inconsistent differnet thing

[12:05] <brrt> it's moarvm that is the fun bit :-)

[12:13] <brrt> https://gist.github.com/bdw/f38e10d88f1967b6e67a

[12:13] <brrt> lizmat ^

[12:14] <brrt> reading that, i kind of know what to do

[12:14] *** tokuhirom joined
[12:14] <lizmat> :-)

[12:14] <brrt> but it pushes back the date of merging even-moar-jit back further still

[12:24] <lizmat> brrt: I think we can handle delays, we're pretty good at it  :-)

[12:28] *** tokuhirom joined
[12:50] <brrt> :-) well, that is true

[20:33] <nwc10> jnthn: please could you take a look at https://gitlab.com/nwc10/MoarVM/tree/shrink-str-and-stable before rebootstrapping?

[20:36] <retupmoca> are there any known jitbugs?

[20:37] <retupmoca> I'm on moar master, and have a piece of code throwing (incorrectly) "Default constructor only takes named arguments", but when I run it with MVM_JIT_DISABLE, it works correctly

[20:37] *** Ven_ joined
[20:38] <retupmoca> it happened after adding code to other parts of the system, and it throws the first time I hit that codepath, so something inside the compiler jitting incorrectly?

[20:39] <retupmoca> see https://github.com/retupmoca/egeler.us/blob/master/lib/Site/Template.pm6#L19 (running that by itself works fine, so I'm not sure how to go about golfing this)

[20:43] <nwc10> I'm awake (but not for long) but sorry, I can't offer any help on this one

[20:44] <lizmat> perhaps brrt can be of help, but he doesn't appear to be online atm

[20:48] <retupmoca> unfortunately the JIT is a little beyond my current debugging skills :)
