[11:27] <ilmari> nwc10: that's probably my fault

[11:27] * ilmari has a look

[11:34] <ilmari> i >= result_alloc - repl_length # fails when repl_length > result_alloc

[11:34] <ilmari> all the variables are unsigned

[11:34] <ilmari> MVMuint32 or size_t

[11:35] <nwc10> I'm not familiar with that code, so can't comment

[11:35] <nwc10> and a bit too much $work is happening currently

[11:36] <timotimo> well, looks like ilmari is about to fix it

[11:36] <ilmari> how us(able|eful) is ASAN on gcc 4.9.2 (debian)?

[11:37] <timotimo> i think it's usable

[11:37] <timotimo> you'll need to install that extra package, but it'll be fine

[11:38] <timotimo> and we have the helpful --asan thing for Configure.pl

[11:38] <ilmari> yeah, I found that

[11:38] <timotimo> good good

[11:45] <nwc10> ilmari: the question is ASAN on that debian generally? Or ASAN for MoarVM?

[11:46] <ilmari> nwc10: in general

[11:47] <ilmari> nwc10: I was just wondering if I should install a newer gcc or clang, or whether I can just build with --asan on stock debian stable

[11:47] <nwc10> OK, I don't know.

[11:47] <timotimo> actually, i wonder if we should enable ASAN on our travis builds?

[11:47] <timotimo> especially since we're usually ASAN clean

[11:48] <arnsholt> Using the stock compiler should be OK for ASAN and such

[11:52] <nwc10> ilmari: the ASAN I'm using is gcc (GCC) 4.9.0

[11:53] <nwc10> a local build on CentOS $something

[11:53] <nwc10> (it's "my" machine, not my machine)

[11:53] <nwc10> we get some hangs on ASAN builds in the tests for various concurrency features

[11:53] <timotimo> oh, damn

[11:53] <nwc10> I assume that these are race conditions we hit due to slower execution times

[11:54] <nwc10> but they'd really hurt on an automated build

[11:54] <nwc10> and however much we go

[11:54] <nwc10> jnthn++

[11:54] <nwc10> there still only seems to be one of him

[11:54] <nwc10> and I think he's got other things to look at first

[11:55] <timotimo> that's fair

[11:57] <jnthn> People who can debug concurrency bugs seem to be few and far between

[11:59] <nwc10> good UGT, jnthn

[11:59] <jnthn> o/

[11:59] <nwc10> there's a lot of contention on the time of the folks who can debug concrrency bugs

[11:59] <timotimo> %)

[12:00] <jnthn> And, sadly, debugging concurrency bugs seems to need to acquire a mutex on their brane

[12:55] <konobi> how does the build/setup.pm work? (in terms of OS vs Platform vs toolchain)

[14:16] <ilmari> nwc10: I have a fix for the overflow in ascii (and latin1, windows1252 and utf8(_c8)), but utf16 is still borked

[14:16] <ilmari> because it does no checking at all, just assumes that any charcter can fit in 4 bytes

[20:25] <timotimo> ilmari: will we get that as a pull request or patch? :)

[20:30] * jnthn suspects PR

[20:30] <jnthn> I think ilmari is hacking at lunchtimes though, so we'll likely have to wait until lunchtime happens again ;)

[20:31] <nwc10> and being ilmari, we might have to wait several days until he remembers that it's lunchtime

[20:33] <[Coke]> crap, lunch.

[20:34] <nwc10> oh no, not *another* ilmari

[20:39] <ilmari> nwc10: accept no imitations!

[20:39] <psch> hm, an arg with a non-MVM_CALLSITE_ARG_OBJ arg_type doesn't have a container spec, right?

[20:40] <ilmari> jnthn: my home laptop has started having thermal issues, so I prefer anything that involves lots of compiling on my work workstation

[20:40] <timotimo> accept no limitations!

[20:40] <psch> or is that just not reachable with .o but instead the corresponding typed... something (register?)

[20:44] <[Coke]> I'm not actually hungry, despite it being nearly 4pm here. weird.

[20:45] <nwc10> I "just" outsource my compiling to shell accounts other people give me

[20:46] <jnthn> psch: Um...I think it's unreachable *at the moment*

[20:46] <jnthn> Not sure it should be

[20:48] <psch> jnthn: because that's what it looks like is missing

[20:49] <psch> as in, cached dispatch between Int and Int is rw works

[20:49] <psch> but bring an int is rw and int in there it only dispatches the the latter

[20:51] <jnthn> Oops. :)

[20:51] * jnthn wonders if the cahce needs to learn about native refs...

[20:56] <psch> https://gist.github.com/peschwa/92605dd3ec50054f9a9d is my test case, just to make sure i'm not messing that up again... :)

[21:14] <jnthn> psch: Need to rest now; will look in the monring :)
