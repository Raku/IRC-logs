[14:07] <timotimo> heyo

[14:09] <brrt`> how is today? :-)

[14:10] <timotimo> not so good for me. my wrist has been in pain since yesterday and i feel kind of reluctant to work on the weekly (or anything, for that matter)

[14:11] <timotimo> how are you?

[14:12] <brrt`> i'm... okay, i guess, in good health for one thing :-)

[14:12] <brrt`> sorry to hear about your wrist

[14:12] <brrt`> how come

[14:19] <timotimo> not sure. putting too much stress on it through typing or something?

[14:19] <brrt`> well, i can't tell remotely :-)

[14:19] <brrt`> hopefully you'll get better

[14:21] <lizmat> timotimo: want me to take up the weekly this week ?

[14:21] <timotimo> oh, that'd be helpful! <3

[14:23] <lizmat> ok, I'll do it tonight, but first I will need to be afk for a bit

[14:37] <timotimo> thank you

[17:06] <[Coke]> me is >< close to getting 2014.02 moarvm into macports.

[17:09] <timotimo> Coke++ # excellent news

[17:11] *** vendethiel joined
[17:15] <[Coke]> well, then I have to get nqp & rakudo. :)

[18:14] <[Coke]> has anyone ever compiled moarvm on a powerpc mac?

[18:17] <nwc10> I'm not aware of it, but it ought to be easy (or at least easier) now

[18:18] <[Coke]> we might get it for "free" if the universal macport works.

[18:18] <[Coke]> a macporter is testing it now, but having difficulty building the 32bit intel variant.

[18:22] <nwc10> TimToady: that first change causes this NQP test to break, I think by design:

[18:22] <nwc10> ok( nqp::index('Hello World', '') == -1, 'nqp::index with empty match returns -1');

[18:22] <nwc10> however, this test still passes, which suggests an inconsistency:

[18:22] <nwc10> ok( nqp::rindex('Hello World', '') == -1, 'nqp::rindex with empty match returns -1');

[18:22] <nwc10> and I've no idea what JVM thinks

[18:30] <TimToady> I'm still working on those tests, and a fix

[18:31] <nwc10> ah OK cool

[18:37] <dalek> MoarVM: 8769b8c | TimToady++ | src/strings/ops.c:

[18:37] <dalek> MoarVM: fix rindex too, duh

[18:37] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8769b8c4b5

[18:38] <TimToady> that still fails one test on moar, and a couple on JVM, but have to run an errand

[18:41] <TimToady> if anyone wants to work on the nqp fails, feel free

[18:53] <[Coke]> moarvm fails on OS X 10.6; hopefully getting a ticket out of that shortly.

[18:53] <[Coke]> https://build.macports.org/builders/buildports-snowleopard-x86_64/builds/34113

[18:55] <[Coke]> https://build.macports.org/builders/buildports-snowleopard-x86_64/builds/34113/steps/compile/logs/stdio is the build, I don't see a specific failure.

[18:56] <[Coke]> Ionic++ found it: Can't locate autodie.pm

[18:56] <[Coke]> so we have a dep on at least perl 5.10.1
