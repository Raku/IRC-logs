[00:51] <timotimo> i seem to get quite a few SEGV originating from the decont op in interp.c

[10:48] <arnsholt> jnthn: I think doing positional access on an uncomposed P6opaque will deref a null pointer. Not a big deal, or something that should be fixed?

[10:49] <nwc10> well, being able to SEGV the VM is a bad thing

[10:50] <nwc10> it feels like it ought to fire off a suitable VM-level exception

[10:50] <nwc10> is it easy & cheap to do that? Or is it complex and painful?

[10:54] <arnsholt> if(!repr_data) MVM_exception_throw_ad_hoc(tc, "Don't do that!"); // More or less

[10:55] <nwc10> I think that it's worth it, with a descriptive message

[10:55] <nwc10> ie define "that" :-)

[10:56] <nwc10> (I am not jnthn)

[10:57] <arnsholt> Yeah, other code paths in P6opaque already do that check

[13:18] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/awwaiid/ef3f0abcfa96e34977b4 - this showed up in my perl6 news net.

[13:18] * arnsholt can haz HashAttrStore with positional and associative delegation

[13:18] <[Coke]> ... www

[13:18] <arnsholt> \o/

[13:20] <arnsholt> jnthn: Do you want me to add some tests to NQP to excercise the delegation stuff too?

[13:43] <[Coke]> in general, tests is good.

[14:41] <arnsholt> Hmm. Making HashAttrStore delegate boxing is a bit trickier than positional and associatives

[15:30] <jnthn> arnsholt: Please do, though be careful where you put them unless you're going to impl this on JVM also :)

[16:32] <japhb> [Coke]: That awwaiid gist makes me unnaturally happy.

[16:32] * japhb glares at the mountains of Python libraries at $day-job

[16:34] <[Coke]> I got someone who just uses perl to get their job done interested in perl6 by showing them that gist.

[16:37] <japhb> [Coke]: I bet.  It's a pretty powerful dozen lines or so.
