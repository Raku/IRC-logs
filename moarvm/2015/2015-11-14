[09:59] <cygx> o/

[10:01] <cygx> I just built a fresh triple moar/nqp/rakudo using strawberry perl, and it's rather segfault-y

[10:01] <cygx> eg the repl does not work at all

[10:01] <cygx> I always had to set MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 to compile the setting, but after that, it used to work

[10:02] <nwc10> does it work without MVM_SPESH_DISABLE, but with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 instead?

[10:02] <nwc10> (ie the setting build, and the spectest)

[10:03] <nwc10> (I'm about to go out, but the answer will be useful when others wake up, because it might be the same thing that I saw)

[10:05] <cygx> the repl works with just MVM_JIT_DISABLE set, but the setting compiltion used to require disabling spesh

[10:05] <cygx> I'll check

[10:08] <cygx> compilation succeeded with spesh anabled and jit disabled

[12:30] <timotimo> i ended up explaining the MoarVM spesh op ABI thing in so much detail, i could have just implemented it myself in the time %)

[15:50] <arnsholt> timotimo: Sometimes, that's what you have to do. =)

[15:51] <arnsholt> And from the looks of the issue, there are a couple of ways to do it. Sometimes consensus up front is better than sorting out fallout afterwards

[16:20] <timotimo> right

[16:20] <timotimo> though

[16:21] <timotimo> we usually do "forgiveness > permission"

[16:28] <arnsholt> Oh, very true that

[16:29] <arnsholt> When there's something I'm not quite sur of though, I still like to pass things by jnthn first. He tends to have a keen eye for what's the best way to do something

[16:29] <timotimo> that's right
