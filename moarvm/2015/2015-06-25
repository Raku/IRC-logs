[18:43] <FROGGS> o/

[18:46] <hoelzro> hello FROGGS

[18:49] <FROGGS> hoelzro: you don't have access to an osx box by any chance?

[18:49] <hoelzro> no sir =(

[18:49] <FROGGS> :/

[18:50] <hoelzro> I think brrt uses OS X?

[18:50] <hoelzro> I wish we had an OS X devbox

[18:50] <hoelzro> maybe I should try to get my old Macbook back from my sister =P

[18:51] <FROGGS> :P

[18:52] <FROGGS> no, don't make her upset :o)

[18:52] <FROGGS> I'm checking the libffi branch now on windows, and when it does not complain, I'll merge

[18:52] <FROGGS> and then I finally need to write tests for the new shell()/run()

[18:53] <FROGGS> I'm sloppy :o(

[18:56] <hoelzro> it would be nice to have an OS X machine to test on

[18:56] <hoelzro> I wonder if there's a service like AWS that would let us spin one up

[19:01] <TEttinger> yeah, I've heard of one...

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: 395535d | FROGGS++ | / (12 files):

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: support libffi besides dyncall (switchable via Configure.pl --has-libffi)

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM:

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: Libffi is a very portable backend for foreign function calls. So this will

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: unblock MoarVM from reaching platforms like mips, s390x, sparc, and

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: potentially others.

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: d27e28e | FROGGS++ | src/core/nativecall_dyncall.c:

[19:05] <dalek> MoarVM: unbreak dyncall build, nwc10++

[19:07] <TEttinger> https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross this is not it.

[19:07] <TEttinger> but that looks pretty useful

[19:13] <dalek> MoarVM: fc49a46 | FROGGS++ | .travis.yml:

[19:13] <dalek> MoarVM: also test --has-libffi under travis
