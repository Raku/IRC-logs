[05:50] <konobi> can I ask... how independent is moarvm in terms of external deps?

[06:02] <TimToady> > ls 3rdparty/

[06:02] <TimToady> dynasm  dyncall  libatomic_ops  libtommath  libuv  msinttypes  README.md  sha1  tinymt  uthash.h

[06:07] <konobi> huh

[06:07] *** tokuhiro_ joined
[06:08] <konobi> might be a little beyond me for now, in terms of collecting for a static binary

[07:01] <timotimo> konobi: did you already see --static in moarvm's Configure.pl?

[15:32] <nwc10> we build on aarch64

[15:32] <nwc10> OK, so arguably a bit more than that - we pass the Perl 6 spectests

[15:35] <timotimo> sounds good! do we have(/need?) some kind of architecture overview page?

[19:01] <konobi> timotimo: a flag isn't all that indicative of independence

[19:28] <timotimo> to be honest, i don't know what you mean by "independent" in this case
