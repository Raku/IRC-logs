[00:24] <timotimo> heyo brrt, have you accidentally rebased x64-dynamic-registers onto nfa_to_statelist at some point?

[00:26] *** avar joined
[00:28] *** Util joined
[00:30] *** ChanServ joined
[00:30] <timotimo> is that branch even still interesting?

[00:30] * timotimo goes through moar's branches to see if anything interesting fell between the cracks

[00:31] <timotimo> i'd still like to get early-death-percentages up and running again :\

[00:36] *** avar joined
[00:42] *** avar joined
[01:15] <timotimo> i put a debug statement in that's supposed to help me find out where this one spesh opt (iscont and iscont_[ins] to constant values) triggers

[01:15] <timotimo> but the output doesn't get interleaved properly

[01:17] <timotimo> anyway, there was a lonely little branch that implemented iscont in spesh and i added the _i, _n, and _s parts and will spectest now

[02:11] <timotimo> turns out that optimization isn't good enough yet.

[02:11] <timotimo> as it breaks many a spectest

[02:12] <timotimo> i should try to get some rest now

[02:12] <timotimo> o/

[09:26] <brrt> good *

[09:26] <brrt> timotimo: x64-dynamic-registers is the dynasm branch, not the moar branch

[09:27] <brrt> but I have been merging in master quite a few times over the last few weeks, so, possibly it is in there
