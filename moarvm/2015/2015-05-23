[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: d3713c9 | jnthn++ | src/ (2 files):

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: Replace a #define with a static inline.

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM:

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: There was a note in the #moarvm backlog that we may be failing to pay

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: attention to the "allocate in gen2" flag by using the macro too early.

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: While I can't find any evidence of that, changing to a static inline

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: should make such a bug less likely to be introduced.

[10:09] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d3713c9485

[12:36] <nwc10> jnthn: I think that the problem is MVM_gc_allocate_object(), which is used in lots of 6model repr structs

[12:36] <nwc10> looks like it allocates in the nursery

[12:36] <nwc10> and it's called via the function pointer ->allocate() in various places

[12:37] <nwc10> wait, huh

[12:37] <jnthn> MVM_gc_allocate_object calls MVM_gc_allocate_zeroed which calls MVM_gc_allocate

[12:37] <nwc10> yes, hence "huh"

[12:37] <nwc10> I'd just got there

[12:37] <jnthn> Which is the thing that used to be a macro but is now the inline static.

[12:37] <jnthn> I was kinda excited that we were gonna discover a stupid thinko and it'd explain so much, but it seems that no...

[12:37] <nwc10> anyway, I hit the problem a third time and didn't paste the stacktrace

[12:38] <nwc10> but the failure (trying to lock a mutex again) happens down in SCRef.c each time

[12:38] <jnthn> grumble

[12:38] <jnthn> Of course I can never see these problems on Windows.

[12:39] <jnthn> 'cus mutexes *are* reentrant by default there.

[19:16] <FROGGS> jnthn: (just a reminder) moarvm.org needs an update

[19:21] <jnthn> FROGGS: I'm sleeping now 'cus 4:30am wake-up for flight (and after it I at least will have a week without any flights, *phew*...) Anyways, please poke me again in the next couple of days. :)

[19:22] <FROGGS> jnthn: a week without flights is better than a week without sleep (which is what my brain constructed first)

[19:22] <FROGGS> k, will poke :o)
