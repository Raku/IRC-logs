[09:31] <nwc10> I have not watched this yet: http://blog.pyston.org/2015/11/24/pyston-talk-recording/

[09:31] <brrt> neither has /me

[09:31] <nwc10> only spotted the blog entry this morning

[09:32] * brrt is starting to be of age to see silicon valley upstarts as 'cute', rather than 'intimidating'

[15:14] <nwc10> I have now. It's very interesting. And quite easy to follow.

[15:14] <nwc10> even at 1.25 speed

[15:15] <nwc10> only downside is that he doesn't repeat the questions. And the recording quality was not as good as TimToady at Craigslist

[15:15] <nwc10> TimToady++ # repeating the question

[15:16] <arnsholt> Yeah, that's a sign of a good speaker, actually

[15:17] <arnsholt> I try to remember that when I'm lecturing and such, but it's actually surprisingly hard to not just answer the question immediately

[15:20] <timotimo> that's right

[15:28] <jnthn> (surprisingly hard) agree :)

[15:29] <timotimo> because as soon as the first words of the question have been parsed, your brain starts formulating an answer already :P

[15:29] <timotimo> at least that seems to be the case with me

[15:30] <jnthn> Yes, same :)
