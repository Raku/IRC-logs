[08:11] <brrt> good *

[08:11] <brrt> yesterday i wasted my time in the worst way ever

[08:12] <brrt> i entered a discussion on the internet

[08:12] <FROGGS> hehe

[08:12] <brrt> with a climate change denier, no less

[08:12] <FROGGS> it is just weather isnt it? :P

[08:12] <brrt> this resulted in me promising to myself never to do that again

[08:12] <brrt> people on the internet are not interested in an honest dialogue

[08:13] <FROGGS> but you will, I bet

[08:13] <brrt> (i feel so naive for saying this in 2015)

[08:13] <FROGGS> bbl &

[08:13] <brrt> see you!

[08:14] <brrt> i'm actually dreading a certain change in the JIT

[08:30] <brrt> hmmm

[08:30] <brrt> now that i think about it i may know where my error is coming from

[09:56] <timotimo> \o/

[09:56] <timotimo> finding the error is half the battle won

[11:19] <brrt> how about making a hypothesis about the error?

[11:23] <timotimo> sounds good as well

[11:23] <timotimo> because a hypothesis should lead somewhat quickly to viable tests

[11:23] <timotimo> or at least point out fruitful avenues of exploration
