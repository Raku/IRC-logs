[08:17] <brrt> timotimo: you can merge jit_devirt_reprops_4 if you wish

[08:24] <brrt> btw, i suppose you've all seen https://github.com/hintjens/zs

[08:25] <brrt> i have one thing to say..... does the author think we've regressed since the 80's with direct threaded interpreters?

[08:26] <brrt> i mean, why even encode an interpretation mode in your language

[09:09] <timotimo> i havent seen it

[09:14] <brrt> wants to be javascript, but based on forth and zeromq

[09:14] <brrt> it's a bad idea

[09:56] <timotimo> zeromq? how does that fit?

[10:49] *** vendethiel joined
[11:09] <brrt> it does not :-)

[11:14] <timotimo> No recursive descent parsers either. A language that needs recursion to parse it is too complex.  ← huh?

[11:16] <timotimo> "I don't see why regular expressions, commands, keystrokes, or template code should have different syntaxes. They're all text." - wow, that goes in the complete opposite direction from perl6

[11:17] <brrt> i don't see why we can't all just write lisp, forth, or failing that, assembly language

[11:17] <brrt> :-P

[11:17] <brrt> i mean

[11:19] <brrt> complexity is additive, thus complexity of your program is the complexity of the language + the complexity of your code, therefore a complex language will always yield more complex programs, q.e.d

[11:19] <brrt> (find the five logic flaws)

[11:38] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 32 commits to MoarVM by timo

[11:38] <timotimo> thank you, brrt

[11:38] <timotimo> ... 32 commits?

[11:38] <timotimo> oh my

[11:40] <brrt> yes

[11:40] <brrt> long list

[11:40] <brrt> hard work

[11:41] <brrt> perchance a non-ff merge?

[11:41] <timotimo> oh

[11:41] <brrt> oh, no, oh well :-)

[11:42] <timotimo> i can still put a non-ff merge commit on top

[11:42] <brrt> yeah, but it doesn't matter all that much

[11:42] <timotimo> hm

[11:42] <brrt> although maybe it matters for disecting

[11:42] *** vendethiel joined
[11:44] <brrt> i can fix it i think, if you want

[11:44] <timotimo> oh?

[11:45] <timotimo> it'd be a great help if you gave me the commit id that was pre-merge

[11:45] <timotimo> i seem to lack my favourite git log alias

[11:45] <dalek> MoarVM: 9ffd57c | brrt++ | src/ (4 files):

[11:45] <dalek> MoarVM: Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/jit_devirt_reprops_4'

[11:45] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/9ffd57c317

[11:45] <timotimo> perfect

[11:45] <brrt> 1475976 was your commit :-)

[11:46] <brrt> that was easier than i thoughth, no forcing was required

[11:46] <timotimo> of course not

[11:46] <timotimo> :)

[11:47] <timotimo> what should i do next-ish?

[11:47] <brrt> eh...

[11:47] <timotimo> i don't feel like working on UDP sockets again

[11:47] <brrt> what do you want to do, and how much time do you have for it

[11:47] <timotimo> i want perl6 to be better :P

[11:47] <brrt> right. so do i :-)

[11:48] <brrt> that said, i wouldnt know how to do anything about the nqp/rakudo stack

[11:48] <brrt> tracing has been on my mind, but it's more complex than it looks in some cases

[11:48] <timotimo> most probably

[11:48] <FROGGS> timotimo: you are more interested in C stuff, right?

[11:48] <brrt> do we have something like a shared wiki page where we can dump ideas?

[11:49] <timotimo> more in C than in what?

[11:49] <FROGGS> Perl 6

[11:49] <brrt> (when i say it's more complex than it looks, that means i think i've some unresolved issues, not that it's nearly impossible)

[11:49] <FROGGS> like, you seem to be more interesting in tuning MoarVM than working on nqp/rakudo itself

[11:49] <timotimo> i like both

[11:50] <FROGGS> timotimo: well, then grepping for #?rakudo in roast might be inspiring... it is at least for me

[11:51] <brrt> roadmap says nativeref optimization would be desirable

[11:51] <brrt> i'd.... think that would be doable, but not very small

[11:52] <timotimo> i've been banging my head against trying to get local/localref code-gen working properly

[11:52] <timotimo> that's more or less a prerequisite to having nativeref optimizations have a big effect, i think?

[11:53] <timotimo> well, i suppose it can make lexicalref things better, too

[11:57] <brrt> alright, lets rubber duck a bit :-)

[11:57] <brrt> what does local/localref do

[11:57] <timotimo> right, the thing i'm talking about is having a variable that's defined to be a local accessed somewhere in a scope set to localref

[11:58] <timotimo> or the other way around, having a variable that's defined to be a localref accessed as a local

[11:58] <timotimo> currently, the code-gen for one of these cases throws a bogus instruction right in the middle of the code that makes things blow up

[11:59] <brrt> ok, is that always the same bogus instruction?

[11:59] <brrt> do you know what inserts it?

[11:59] <timotimo> i haven't found what inserts it

[11:59] <timotimo> gimme a second, i'll find it for you again

[11:59] <brrt> :-D

[12:00] <timotimo> i mean, find what instruction it is

[12:01] <brrt> right

[12:01] <brrt> my next question would be, are you sure the information in the oplist is correct

[12:02] <timotimo> bleh, gnome3 just stole my mouse

[12:03] <timotimo> hum

[12:03] <timotimo> this is an output i don't remember seeing

[12:04] <timotimo> not ok 1 - localref of type int with value 23 assigned to itQAST::Var with scope 'localref' NYI

[12:04] <timotimo> QAST::Var with scope 'localref' NYI

[12:04] <timotimo> ... what?

[12:04] <timotimo> didn't i just implement that ...

[12:06] <timotimo> well, anyway ... the code is in "mast_localref_2"

[12:06] <timotimo> in t/moar/02*t

[12:07] <timotimo> i'll be AFK for a bit

[12:10] <brrt> ok, that's the branch?

[12:33] <timotimo> yes, that's right

[12:36] <timotimo> ah, i know what i did wrong

[12:36] <timotimo> i ran "make" instead of "make install"

[12:37] <brrt> :-D

[12:38] <brrt> that is a moarvm branch, right

[12:38] <brrt> because i can't fetch it

[12:40] <timotimo> no, an nqp branch

[12:40] <timotimo> not ok 4 - a localref'd var can have a local ref'd thing bound to it and accessed (str)Cannot assign to an immutable value

[12:40] <timotimo> moar doesn't even have a t/ :)

[12:42] <brrt> quite true

[12:42] <brrt> which is probably right, and probably wrong, at the same time

[12:47] <timotimo> check this

[12:47] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/ac81c1ee775152202e23

[12:48] <timotimo> you see that decont_s there?

[12:49] <timotimo> we're getting the string out of the strlexref, boxing it into a Str and trying to assign to that Str box

[12:49] <timotimo> which ... wat

[12:49] <timotimo> oh, hold on

[12:50] <timotimo> maybe decl'ing a localref with :returns(str) is the culprit?

[12:50] <timotimo> removing that gets rid of the bogus str boxing at least

[12:51] <timotimo> gist updated

[13:00] <brrt> let me see

[13:01] <brrt> not sure i fully understand...

[13:02] <timotimo> that's what i'm here for

[13:03] <timotimo> isn't it fun when the duck and duckee switch places? :P

[13:04] <timotimo> ah

[13:04] <timotimo> sorry, the explanation was wrong

[13:04] <timotimo> what i really wanted to point out was this:

[13:04] <timotimo> assign_s is trying to assign into a register that hasn't been set up with anything

[13:04] <timotimo> er

[13:04] <timotimo> that's also not true

[13:05] <timotimo> but why does it decont? :(

[13:15] <brrt> for safety

[13:16] *** cygx joined
[13:17] <timotimo> i just dcon't understand

[13:17] <cygx> should dynload on windows be patched to use something like LoadLibraryExA(libPath, NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DLL_LOAD_DIR | LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DEFAULT_DIRS) instead of plain LoadLibraryA(libPath)?

[13:18] <brrt> ok, the decont takes the string out of the localref and into r2

[13:18] <cygx> LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DLL_LOAD_DIR seems a reasonable thing to have

[13:18] <brrt> const_s stores 'hooray' into in r3

[13:18] <brrt> assign_s assigns r3 into r2, which is impossible, because r2 holds a string and not a container

[13:19] <brrt> what it should be, i think, is assign(r1, r3)

[13:19] <brrt> cygx: sorry, our resident windows expert is at osdc.no i'm afraid :-)

[13:20] <brrt> if that goes on to search for libs in directories it is a nice-to-have and also a security risk,

[13:20] <brrt> possibly the dynload folks know the tradeoff there

[13:21] <cygx> brrt: the alternative is to tell your users to add to their PATH

[13:31] <timotimo> that's what it should be, yeah, brrt

[13:32] <timotimo> it's also strange that moar emits a decont rather than a decont_s

[13:32] <timotimo> how does that even work?

[13:32] <brrt> you tell me

[13:32] <brrt> :-)

[13:33] <brrt> do you think this is a bug in moarvm level codegen? but that seems unlikely imho

[13:34] <timotimo> it's in nqp

[13:34] <timotimo> all moar does is turn a MAST into bytecode

[13:34] <timotimo> i hope i didn't give you the impression i was looking at moar's internals to fix this

[13:40] *** rurban joined
[13:41] <brrt> ah, ok

[13:41] <brrt> could've been moar :-)

[13:42] <brrt> but yeah, i'm afraid i'm rather unhelpful here

[13:43] <timotimo> aaw

[13:46] <brrt> i know very little about nqp except how to use it

[13:47] <brrt> but anyway, that codegen is certainly of whack

[13:48] <timotimo> good to know i'm not just hallucinating the problem

[16:22] <dlem> jnthn: I have looked more closely into the matter on the time spent on UTF-8 decoding.

[16:23] <dlem> Unfortunately I won't be able to make it to the OSDC - I've been hit by the flu and am just now starting to recover.

[16:24] <dlem> Anyway, here goes:

[16:25] <dlem> 1: The three first functions in utf8.c should be marked MVM_STATIC_INLINE

[16:28] <dlem> 2: The CHAR/NONCHAR distinction is incorrect, see http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html

[16:38] <dlem> 3: I have implemented The World's Fastest UTF-8 Decoder (TM) ;-), however this probably won't improve things that much for you - the decoding itself is already so fast that loop overhead and pipeline stalls may take longer time.

[20:09] <FROGGS> ahh, packager you are

[20:09] <nebuchadnezzar> yes

[20:09] <FROGGS> then you probably use your packaged libtommath, which misses important patches

[23:37] <japhb> Anyone happen to know if the .so file installation under panda got fixed?

[23:38] <timotimo> i haven't kept sufficiently close tabs

[23:40] <timotimo> i haven't run benchmarks in a long time, i think

[23:41] <timotimo> but right now "turning lexicals into locals" is not really in effect, so we are sort of in the "pre-lowering era" again

[23:41] <timotimo> and that makes me sad
