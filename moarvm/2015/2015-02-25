[11:43] <dalek> MoarVM: fix allocating an empty (no members) CStruct bug

[11:43] <dalek> MoarVM:

[11:43] <dalek> MoarVM: it segfaults when we try to allocate memory for an empty CStruct, this fix prevents from allocating memory of size -1

[18:59] * timotimo isn't quite sure how to make spesh clever for native_ref yet

[19:00] <jnthn> I'll get there soonish, I suspect :)

[19:00] <timotimo> oh

[19:01] <timotimo> i thought maybe i could take that piece of work off your plate if it's easy-ish

[19:01] <jnthn> I'm not really sure it is...

[19:03] <timotimo> k

[21:14] <jnthn> timotimo: About?

[21:16] <timotimo> abuot:blank

[21:16] <timotimo> that's an interesting way to typo "about"

[21:16] <jnthn> :P

[21:16] <timotimo> but the answer is yes

[21:17] <jnthn> timotimo: If you're up for a bench run, it'd be interesting to know how native-ref compares to nom

[21:17] <jnthn> (Just on Moar)

[21:18] <dalek> MoarVM:

[21:18] <dalek> MoarVM: We can look at the types and do some devirtualization here, mind.

[21:19] <timotimo> okidok

[21:20] <timotimo> uh

[21:20] <timotimo> i don't think my computer is actually awake right now :(

[21:22] <timotimo> yeah, i didn't wake it up when i left the house today

[21:25] <jnthn> Well, doesn't have to be Right Now :)

[21:25] <jnthn> We'll probably need a couple of goes at it before we're happy native-ref can go into master

[21:26] <timotimo> hmm, ok
