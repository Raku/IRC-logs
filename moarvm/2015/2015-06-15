[07:42] <nwc10> o/

[07:45] <brrt> today i start hacking!

[07:45] <nwc10> rah!

[07:45] <brrt> :-)

[07:45] <nwc10> any firm idea on where you're going to start?

[07:46] <FROGGS> beer! /o/

[07:46] <FROGGS> :P

[07:46] <nwc10> even *I* think that it's a bit early for beer

[07:46] <nwc10> give it half an hour or so...

[07:46] <FROGGS> *g*

[07:49] <brrt> tea!

[07:49] <brrt> well, i was going to start by creating a prototype outside the moar code branch

[07:50] <brrt> i was thinking of naming the branch: even-moar-jit

[07:50] <brrt> and i'm going to start hacking on dynasm sometime

[11:58] <masak> brrt++ # today he starts hacking!

[11:59] <tadzik> yay :)

[12:19] * FROGGS throws in https://qa.debian.org/bls/packages/m/moarvm.html

[12:23] <masak> MoarVM is a Debian package? cool!

[12:24] <masak> could something be done about those rather unsightly "7 issues"?

[12:24] <FROGGS> masak: look at: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/moarvm

[12:24] <FROGGS> :o)

[12:24] <FROGGS> masak: yes, of course

[12:26] <masak> \o/

[12:27] <nwc10> masak: see also the \o/ at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2015-06-14#i_10749126

[12:27] <FROGGS> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/nqp is still at 2014.07, but will also be updated thanks to nebuchadnezzar and dod

[12:31] <masak> heh, interp.c is huge, and it's basically just one big switch statement :P

[12:31] <FROGGS> well, it is true :o)

[12:32] <masak> there are 81 lines before and 16 lines after the switch statement, which itself is 4891 lines ;)

[13:00] <arnsholt> Any idea why the build is reproducible? Is it just the SC ids being based on time and such, or something more problematic?

[13:00] <arnsholt> s/is/isn't/

[13:02] <moritz> that's also the first thing that came to my mind

[13:02] <moritz> and you can't artifically set the timestamps all to the same time

[13:02] <moritz> cause then the different stages will get identical SC IDs, and things blow up prettily

[13:03] <nwc10> you're thinking about NQP, I think

[13:03] <nwc10> this is MoarVM - does it compile anything?

[13:03] <arnsholt> Yeah, that's why I wasn't sure

[13:03] <moritz> right, NQP

[13:17] <FROGGS> it is about guids and stuff

[13:18] <FROGGS> ahh, that explains it: https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/Howto

[13:19] <FROGGS> stuff like: "Files in data.tar contains hostname, uname output, username"

[14:13] <nebuchadnezzar> hello

[14:14] <nebuchadnezzar> I'm trying to understand https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d2e5c768f1ea69932d0a2ed1e0b26299281700ca, since it makes lintian unhappy (https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-rakudo-devel/2015-June/000567.html)

[14:15] <nebuchadnezzar> If I understand correctly, this directory will be use by rakudo packages which install a NativeCall library?

[14:19] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: correct

[14:20] <nebuchadnezzar> ok, so we need the rpath

[14:21] <nebuchadnezzar> FROGGS: so MoarVM needs to find thoses libraries

[14:22] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: yes, I think so

[14:23] <FROGGS> we might be able to work around that

[14:23] <FROGGS> but I'm not sure

[14:26] <nebuchadnezzar> Thanks, will see what dod will say about this

[14:26] <FROGGS> thank you

[18:34] <FROGGS> All tests successful.

[18:34] <FROGGS> \o/

[18:36] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: gnu/kfreebsd will be supported soon

[18:37] <japhb> FROGGS++  # Rapid turnaround for porting to a new arch

[18:38] <FROGGS> only semi new :o)

[18:40] <japhb> Given how long it took Debian to support kfreebsd, I'd say porting to it in a few hours counts as excellent work.  :-)

[19:09] <jnthn> Wow, FROGGS++

[19:11] <FROGGS> jnthn: it is just a tiny patch, really :o)

[19:14] <dalek> MoarVM/kfreebsd: 47290b4 | FROGGS++ | / (2 files):

[19:14] <dalek> MoarVM/kfreebsd: support GNU/kFreeBSD

[19:18] <jnthn> I guess since we maintain our own MoarVM/libuv repo it could go in there...

[19:23] <FROGGS> jnthn: in fact we do not maintain our own libuv repo

[19:23] <FROGGS> we use their's

[19:23] <jnthn> oh :)

[19:23] <jnthn> OK, then I've no idea what to do :P

[19:31] <FROGGS> this is the adjusted patch: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/e78f1c16f5e8277fddeb

[19:31] <FROGGS> we could do the packager's approach and apply patches to our deps at configure time :S

[19:36] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: with latest moarvm patch and the gist I just posted MoarVM will work nicely on GNU/kFreeBSD

[19:36] <FROGGS> nebuchadnezzar: it is up to you if you drop in these two patches into the debian package for 2015.04
