[21:05] <brrt> so, no gsoc work for me this year..

[21:05] <jnthn> No :(

[21:05] <jnthn> I wonder if we can find some other way to get you funded to work on JIT stuff.

[21:05] <brrt> shame

[21:06] <jnthn> (Short answer: almost certainly.)

[21:06] <brrt> :-)

[21:06] <brrt> well, that would still be nice

[21:06] <brrt> off-topic

[21:06] <brrt> i notice an increase in geospatial projects

[21:07] <brrt> i have a feeling geospatial software / gis is going to be a fast-growing sector the next few years

[21:12] <brrt> fwiw, i can change all references to the work special register to REGISTER with runtime changes, and... i'm 50/50 on whether that's clearer or not

[21:16] <jnthn> brrt: Are you very much invovled with gis stuff?

[21:16] <brrt> not at all, although some of my fellow students are

[21:17] <brrt> and a few of my former colleagues

[21:17] <brrt> i just see GIS organisations and companies springing up everywhere :-)

[21:41] <brrt> very very offtopic, you know what is hilarious? people suggesting a smart watch can measure blood pressure

[21:42] <jnthn> .oO( The very idea people could think this raises my blood pressure. My watch just...oh! )

[21:42] <lizmat> fwiw, previous models of iPhone were pretty good at measuring heartbeats

[21:42] <lizmat> how you ask?

[21:42] <jnthn> brrt: Do you mean "at all" or "accurately"?

[21:43] <jnthn> lizmat: Some image analysis on the skin, or eyes, or soemthing? :)

[21:43] <brrt> i'd be very hard pressed to find a way to measure blood pressure without significant discomfort to a wearer

[21:43] <brrt> heartbeats are not the same as pressure. heartbeats can be measured by coloration patterns

[21:43] <lizmat> jnthn: you had to put your iPhone on your finger

[21:43] <jnthn> Oh :)

[21:44] <lizmat> it would switch on the flash, and the camera :-)

[21:45] <brrt> and yes, i implied accurately, or 'usefully' :-)

[22:47] <timotimo> after thinking about it a little bit more, i'm now seeing that i will in fact have to put some stuff into the MVMIOOps, even if not new things

[22:47] <timotimo> even if it's just because i have a different struct for the MVMOSHandle's data attribute

[22:48] <timotimo> jnthn: how do you feel about a "datagramy" entry to the ops table?

[22:51] *** kjs_ joined
[22:51] <jnthn> Like how one rock star asked another, "is datagrammy?"

[22:52] <jnthn> Sounds reasonable overall

[23:09] <timotimo> heh heh

[23:16] <timotimo> it's a bit weird that "datagramy" is actually 100% correlated with "connectionless"

[23:16] <timotimo> (SCTP doesn't exist "in the real world")

[23:17] <timotimo> and the connectionlessness has a big influence on the API that the datagramy methods would have to expose

[23:28] <timotimo> i don't think i'm really making progress

[23:28] <timotimo> i seem to have built the ops for udp sockets based on the assumption that there'll be a specific repr or way to tell a udp socket from a non-udp socket or something

[23:28] <timotimo> the nqp::ops, that is;

[23:29] <timotimo> i only just now realized i'll hav eto enhance the MVMIOOps structure

[23:30] <timotimo> and then there'll be another bit of "interestingness" for sync vs async

[23:59] <[Coke]> I need to explicitly list all the licenses of software distributed by MoarVM. Anyone care to help me update the list?
