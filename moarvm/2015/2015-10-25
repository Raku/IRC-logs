[17:46] <timotimo> we really must not forget the way substr misbehaves when an x'd piece of string is being acted upon

[19:55] <nwc10> t/spec/S05-transliteration/trans.rakudo.moar can hang. twice now. stack backtrace looks like this http://paste.scsys.co.uk/500492

[20:17] <timotimo> nwc10: can you give us a stacktrace with JIT disabled, too?

[20:17] <nwc10> um, yes, I don't know. And I probably need to try tomorrow.

[20:17] <timotimo> thank you :)

[20:18] <timotimo> because all those unreadable stack frames from the jit, you know

[20:18] <nwc10> as in, "I don't know if it will repeat without the JIT" - which I guess is the point of asking. And d'oh for not woring that one out myself.

[20:18] <timotimo> also, perhaps a print MVM_dump_stacktrace (or what it's called) would be interesting

[20:21] <timotimo> the fact that the stack contains a MVM_fixed_size_free confuses me

[20:21] <timotimo> why would a jit frame get called from there?
