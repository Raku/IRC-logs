[10:46] <timotimo> it looks like you moved some variable definitions away from the beginning of the block

[10:46] <timotimo> er

[10:46] <timotimo> no, i read the colors wrong

[10:47] <timotimo> i wonder if we should keep the argument to the op that selects the type of list to initialize

[10:49] <JimmyZ> not sure ,the type in nqp is repr NFA

[10:50] <JimmyZ> well, from the code, i think is no

[10:52] <JimmyZ> oh, it is yes

[10:56] <JimmyZ> timotimo: after look at it again, I 'd say  no, we don't need it

[10:57] <JimmyZ> it only for from_statelist

[10:59] <timotimo> yeah

[10:59] <timotimo> if you want to, you can patch that, too :)

[11:58] <timotimo> should we change something here?

[11:58] <timotimo> it potentially wants to be ->size?

[11:59] <timotimo> hm, it seems like we expect those numbers to be 1, 2, 4 or 8

[12:44] *** Ven joined
[12:52] <timotimo> brrt: do you think it'll be a good idea to throw out all the c function calls from graph.c if they've been translated to the expr list?

[12:52] <brrt> not yet

[12:52] <brrt> eventually, yes

[12:53] <timotimo> will it reduce moarvm's binary size?

[12:54] <brrt> i am one dumb son of a .... feminine canine

[12:55] <brrt> yes, removing it will reduce the memory size. i'm not sure if it will be a net benefit, since we'll offset it with the memory for templates

[12:55] <brrt> but we're talking kilobytes, at best

[12:56] <brrt> or worst

[12:57] <brrt> i do hope it'll be a bit more hackable, less limited

[12:58] <timotimo> OK

[12:59] <timotimo> but this is code size, so we measure it against the instruction cache, which is small

[12:59] <brrt> that is true

[12:59] <timotimo> and templates are data which a small-ish bit of code works on

[12:59] <brrt> yes

[12:59] <brrt> i do hope that offsets the added complexity

[12:59] <timotimo> i hope so, too

[12:59] <brrt> actually, algorithmically the complexity is quite limited

[12:59] <brrt> i've intentionally used only very simple data structures :-)

[13:03] <timotimo> that does sound nice, yeah

[14:24] <JimmyZ> what did I  fix...?

[14:25] <timotimo> you fixed that i forgot to put the & in front of the things i pushed onto the temp roots

[14:25] <timotimo> or was that jnthn? i think it was you
