[19:24] <nwc10> good *, stealth jnthn

[19:24] <brrt> good *, visible nwc10

[19:30] <jnthn> o/

[19:30] <[Coke]> is he due back yet?

[19:30] <[Coke]> ... awesome timing, [Coke] :)

[19:30] * jnthn is back home, though really tired :)

[19:30] <jnthn> hah!

[19:31] <nwc10> I hope that's good tired

[19:35] <FROGGS> hi jnthn

[19:35] <FROGGS> :o)

[19:54] <leont> Wekcine back!

[19:54] <leont> Welcome, typing is difficult!

[20:03] <jnthn> Wekcine looks like a Polish word, but I'm pretty sure it ain't one :P

[20:04] <leont> My right hand had an off-by-one, what does this say about Poles! ;-)

[20:06] *** kjs_ joined
[20:07] <pyrimidi_> leont: that comes from messing in the bioinfo field, where everything starts at 1 :)

[20:10] <jnthn> Sometimes I'm relieved I don't need to try and teach my mouth to do the various sounds in Polish...then I remember Czech has stuff like "strƒç prst skrz krk". :)

[20:21] <FROGGS> jnthn: I just know krtek :o) (and no, you can't drink that :P)

[20:25] <jnthn> FROGGS: I'll look into it tomorrow, but it appears that the way :D/:U stuff is done on parameters hasn't peeled away the definedness type before populating the nominal_type slot in Parameter, which busts spesh's ability to inline lots of math stuff and probably more.

[20:25] <FROGGS> ahh

[20:25] <FROGGS> I've not touched params at all

[20:26] <FROGGS> but I hoped I get some pointers, or that you patched stuff in that area :o)

[20:27] <jnthn> Prolly one where it'll be easiest for me to fix it and show you the patch rather than make you worry about it :)

[20:28] <FROGGS> I think so too :o)

[20:34] <leont> pyrimidine: actually, there's a chance I'm getting back next year :-)

[20:42] *** kjs_ joined
[20:43] <pyrimidine> leont: cool!

[20:44] <pyrimidine> leont: was originally going to suggest that run away as fast as you can :)

[20:46] <leont> Heh

[20:49] <leont> Friend of mine wants me back, he wrote this http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n7/full/nbt.3240.html, I rather agree with him

[20:54] <pyrimidine> Pjotr?

[20:54] <pyrimidine> I agree with him as well :)

[20:56] <leont> Yeah, Pjotr Prins

[21:01] <leont> Perl6's async offers some possibilities do be better at big data, but it'll be difficult in any language
