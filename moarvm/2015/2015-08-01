[09:22] <brrt> MoarVM *almost* builds with gcc on windows

[09:22] <brrt> but not quite :-(

[09:22] <brrt> dyncall issues

[09:43] <timotimo> so try libffi instead?

[09:43] <nebuchadnezzar> o/

[09:44] <timotimo> heyo

[09:45] <jnthn> o/

[09:48] <nebuchadnezzar> time to start having nqp up to date in Debian

[09:49] <timotimo> oh, cool :)

[09:50] <jnthn> \o/

[11:48] <FROGGS> brrt: it builds without problems using gcc on my Windows 7

[11:48] <FROGGS> timotimo: you'd probably need libffi prebuild dlls

[13:19] <brrt> fwiw: gcc 4.9.2 on windows 10 enterprise

[13:19] <brrt> (evaluation license ;-))

[13:20] <brrt> gcc supplied by strawberry perl :-)

[19:11] <nwc10> jnthn: in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/d4ac6afa75 why use MVMint64 for a 1 bit flag?

[19:11] <nwc10> I think that's somewhat less than awesomely efficient on some 32 bit platforms.

[19:12] <jnthn> Depends how smart the C compiler in question is I guess...

[19:12] <nwc10> the ABI may force thigns

[19:13] <jnthn> True

[19:13] <nwc10> I don't actually happen to have anythign to hand to confirm/deny this assumption

[19:13] <nwc10> but I *think* that on a 32 bit system, the caller will have to write two 32 bit words

[19:13] <nwc10> because the caller has no idea that the callee only cares for 1 bit of 1 of them.

[19:14] <nwc10> "write two 32 bit words" is probably actually "assign to 2 registers"

[19:14] <jnthn> I guess the situation on 64-bit isn't pessimized by making it an MVMint32

[19:14] <nwc10> that would be my hunch

[19:15] <jnthn> Given this code is called once per GC run, I'm not sure we stand to lose much in this case :)

[19:15] <nwc10> it was more a "eh, why is it that way?" question

[19:16] <nwc10> agree, we've burned more time in this converstation that likely will ever be saved by fixing it

[19:16] <nwc10> across all MoarVM ever. Or at least "this year"

[19:16] <jnthn> It's that way 'cus I'd just spent a bunch of time hunting a GC race condition, and didn't consider this relatively minor detail...

[19:17] <nwc10> oh, and I comment on the bike shed sized commit?

[19:17] <nwc10> Not the nuclear reactor?

[19:17] <nwc10> (which is far more likely to go boom)

[19:17] <nwc10> so boom | much messy | wah :-(

[19:18] <jnthn> Well, the patch fixes the race

[19:20] <jnthn> One of those where the time to work out what needing fixing took a lot longer than fixing it.

[19:23] <dalek> MoarVM: c40e8a7 | jnthn++ | src/gc/collect. (2 files):

[19:23] <dalek> MoarVM: 32 bits will be sufficient for this flag; nwc10++.

[19:23] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/c40e8a7176

[19:23] <jnthn> Now, if you can find one of those on a hot-path... :)

[19:31] <nwc10> then you will buy me a beer*? [* offer only valid in Köln :-)]

[19:32] <nwc10> [for the local beer. In the correct glass]

[19:34] <nwc10> Oh my. There is such a thing as a Doppelmaß. I didn't know this.

[19:40] <jnthn> A...what???!

[19:40] <jnthn> Either my Germany is rusty of that's a LOT of beer...

[19:40] <timotimo> it's probably a lot of beer

[19:40] <timotimo> nwc10: is it more than a Stiefel?

[19:40] <jnthn> Heh, funny to call my German rusty, I never learned the language. :P

[19:41] <jnthn> I can just order beer, be polite to train conductors, and know some bad words used in Rammstein songs I listened to as a teenager :P

[19:41] <nwc10> I don't know what a Stiefel is, in this context.

[19:42] <nwc10> The source was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_cuisine#Beer -- ... two litre Doppelmaß in the Bavarian style

[19:42] <jnthn> Maybe it's named so 'cus if you drink all of it, it'll stiefel your productivity...

[19:44] <timotimo> hahaha

[19:44] <timotimo> it's an actual boot-shaped glass

[19:44] <nwc10> oh, Stiefel. Yes. I should know that word

[19:44] <nwc10> Gummistiefel

[19:44] <timotimo> :)

[19:45] <timotimo> well, yeah, except the stiefel you'll drink the beer out of isn't a gummistiefel
