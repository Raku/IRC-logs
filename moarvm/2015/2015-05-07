[13:31] <brrt> gotta love recruiters

[13:32] <brrt> 'we're looking for a c embedded programmer who loves to work with the microsft .net environment'

[13:32] <brrt> what

[13:36] <FROGGS> :D

[13:36] <FROGGS> brrt: and? are you an embedded programmer?

[13:37] <brrt> ehm, not really i guess

[13:39] <brrt> not sure what that would take. but probably not a close affinity to microsoft .net

[13:43] <tadzik> I guess recruiters are just targetting everyone with everything

[13:44] <tadzik> "oh, an unemployed perl programmer? Look, we're looking for Ruby people doing devops!"

[13:46] <brrt> well, i'd consider that, but i'm unusually promiscuous among languages

[13:46] <brrt> i'd probably consider programming in delphi if the problem was interesting enough

[19:53] <timotimo> well, moarvm now outputs a line number for every BB

[19:53] <timotimo> someone want to build a tool that annotates the source with BBs next to it? :)

[19:54] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/a884c9902304a1bb360d isn't this a thing of beauty?

[19:55] <jnthn> timotimo: That's from inside a regex/rule/token, at a guess?

[19:56] <timotimo> Spesh of '' (cuid: cuid_70_1430853556.47142, file: src/gen/m-BOOTSTRAP.nqp:1946)

[19:56] <timotimo> $done := 1;

[19:56] <timotimo> }

[19:57] <timotimo> it's find_best_dispatchee

[19:57] <jnthn> ah, ok :)

[20:00] <dalek> MoarVM: 1475976 | timotimo++ | src/spesh/ (3 files):

[20:00] <dalek> MoarVM: give every BB in the spesh log a line number

[20:00] <dalek> MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/147597619a

[20:00] <timotimo> i hope this is c89 compatible

[20:01] <jnthn> I think so :)

[20:01] <jnthn> and it looks as I imagined

[20:02] <timotimo> i just don't really have anything good to do with it right now :\

[21:51] <timotimo> brrt: have you been trying to rebase jit_devirtualize_reprops?

[21:51] <timotimo> i could probably do it now

[21:51] <brrt> i have not yet

[21:51] <brrt> i was leaving it for you

[21:51] <timotimo> oh!

[21:51] <timotimo> i hadn't realized

[21:52] <timotimo> but right now i'm having some slight trouble occupying my mind :P

[21:52] <timotimo> can you help me ~ occupy my brain?

[21:52] <jnthn> .oO( Occupy Timo! )

[21:52] <timotimo> %)

[21:53] <tadzik> I understand that reference!

[21:53] <timotimo> i was kind of sad that devirtualize_reprops seemed to not help anything at all whatsoever

[21:54] <tadzik> tudududududududutudududu dy dummm dym!

[21:54] <brrt> i did not

[21:54] <brrt> (understood the reference)

[21:54] <tadzik> it's from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQBttKoetqo

[21:54] <timotimo> there's a song from the band Hellsongs that i really like; it's a lounge cover of paranoid

[21:55] <timotimo> that song up there

[21:55] <timotimo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THM0eDqAzmU

[21:55] <tadzik> hellsongs is awesome %)

[21:55] <timotimo> they are so

[21:56] <brrt> anyway, yeah i'll rebase

[22:03] *** vendethiel joined
[22:17] <brrt> didn't make it worse, so far at least (speedwise)

[22:18] <brrt> for what it's worht, i like the branch because i want reprops separated in the JIT anyway

[22:22] <dalek> Heuristic branch merge: pushed 32 commits to MoarVM/jit_devirt_reprops_4 by bdw

[22:23] <brrt> that one you can merge, i'd think

[22:31] <timotimo> me? :)

[22:31] <timotimo> did you spectest it?
