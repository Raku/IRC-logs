[09:32] <rudi_s> Could somebody please merge my patches from git://git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/he29heri/moarvm/ - except the last one, which seems to cause build failures.

[09:33] <jnthn> Was that the runloop label moving one?

[09:34] <rudi_s> Yeah.

[09:34] <jnthn> I *thought* it was in the middle rather than at the HEAD, but maybe I mis-remembered...

[09:34] <rudi_s> jnthn: I just rebased it and reorderd it.

[09:34] <jnthn> oh :)

[09:34] <rudi_s> Or I could just drop it, wait a sec.

[09:34] <jnthn> Then it's easy :)

[09:34] <jnthn> Well, or fix it? :)

[09:34] <rudi_s> Dropped it.

[09:34] <jnthn> I think I mentioned something to try...

[09:34] <jnthn> OK

[09:34] <jnthn> :)

[09:34] <rudi_s> Yeah, that owuld be even better. Maybe later today when I have some time.

[09:37] <jnthn> Hm, I'm curious about "jit/graph.c: fix -Wmissing-braces warnings"

[09:37] <jnthn> Is that 'cus it's a union?

[09:38] <timotimo> jnthn: my int @a; my int $i; while $i < 10000000 { @a[$i] = 1; $i = $i + 1 } is many times faster than my int @a; my int $i; while $i < 10000000 { @a[$i] = 1; $i++ }

[09:38] <timotimo> is that because of local/localref lexical/lexicalref optimization missing?

[09:38] <timotimo> as in: $i++ has a lexref in it that means the block can't be lowered or something?

[09:39] <jnthn> That plus nothing is smart enough to know it can inline it yet.

[09:39] <jnthn> uh, to know how to inline it

[09:39] <timotimo> oh

[09:39] *** kjs_ joined
[09:39] <jnthn> But yeah, I'm very aware of that one :)

[09:39] <timotimo> OK :)

[09:41] <rudi_s> jnthn: Yeah. I'm not sure why the braces are required by gcc/clang. But it causes many warnings.

[09:41] <jnthn> ugh

[09:41] <jnthn> Adding them is quite some clutter though.

[09:42] <jnthn> I wonder if some compilers don't accept it without the braces...

[09:42] <rudi_s> I find the end result not that bad, but yeah, it's not really nice.

[09:44] <jnthn> .oO( #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored ... )

[10:05] <jnthn> Anyway, it builds fine and builds NQP fine

[10:08] <jnthn> And Rakudo spectest running now
