[18:50] <timotimo> hm. when we inline stuff that has a return statement but we don't use the return value in the code that uses the inlined blocks, does stuff that purely calculates the return value already get eliminated properly?

[18:51] <jnthn> Not sure, but at least in theory it should just fall out of normal usage stuff

[18:52] <timotimo> very good :)

[18:53] <timotimo> i'm a tiny bit afraid spesh will have a hard time looking through mechanisms like map and stuff, even after the GLR ...

[18:54] <jnthn> That may be the sort of problem where traces are more suitable.
