[15:12] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/b2bdc015f8937bf43fa2 - i don't really understand this asan barfage

[15:13] <timotimo> the line in interp.c is smrt_numify's *obj = GET_REG(cur_op, 2).o;

[15:13] <timotimo> so did the frame's work memory get free'd in the mean time?

[21:43] <timotimo> is line 168 and friends in ConcBlockingQueue.c really safe? what if data isn't OBJECT_BODY(root) for some reason?

[21:45] <timotimo> uv__run_idle seems to get a whole lot of cpu time here

[21:55] <timotimo> maybe we should have an event that fires when GC is being attempted and the eventloop thread waits on that?

[21:55] <timotimo> rather than having the eventloop busy-wait
