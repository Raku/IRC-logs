[05:52] <halivingston> hello, I came here from reddit, cause a kind person told me people here like to talk about cool stuff like calling conventions are code-generating thunks :)

[05:53] <halivingston> I'll introduce myself: For a little hobby interpretive language I've run into a case where depending on the time of the day, the function I'm calling changes its receiving arguments size ...

[05:55] <halivingston> and so I've been looking at how I can make calls to this function with this dynamic behavior, and I think I've found a solution. It is to use libffi to construct the information at function call time and let it do the job.

[05:55] <halivingston> Seems like a flexible library and I was wondering how folks in MoarVM are approaching calling native functions.

[05:55] <halivingston> That's all, maybe I'll spur an interesting discussion

[06:12] <JimmyZ> halivingston: people are sleeping now :)

[06:14] <JimmyZ> halivingston: we are using libffi and dyncall

[11:52] <timotimo> halivingston: in perl6 you can bind the same "native symbol" to multiple subs with different argument lists, then expose a sub that chooses the right one depending on time of day to the end user
