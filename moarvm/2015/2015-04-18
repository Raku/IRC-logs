[13:51] <timotimo> god damn it, jnthn

[13:52] <timotimo> i was debugging why my stuff won't work

[13:52] <timotimo> then i found out the text in the template is "PROFIELR_OUTPUT"

[13:54] <tadzik> :D

[13:55] <tadzik> p6profiler-qt now has progressbars all over the place

[14:00] <timotimo> i'm working on a patch that'll let you provide a --profile-filename=test.json and it won't output the html around the json blob

[14:00] <timotimo> the code works, but isn't that pretty to look at ATM

[14:27] <jnthn> So typo!

[14:27] <jnthn> Sorry, timotimo!

[14:27] <jnthn> It was probably 2am or something when I was doing that part, and I probably just copy-psated the thing :)

[14:31] <timotimo> :))

[14:31] <timotimo> yes, and i re-typed it into my "new" code

[14:48] <timotimo> hooray, we're writing out the json blob

[14:59] <jnthn> :)

[14:59] <timotimo> 200 MB of profile data written ...

[15:00] <jnthn> o.O

[15:00] <timotimo> best thing: with the "write directly" approach, the cpu usage is above 90%

[15:00] <timotimo> hm. nearly 90%

[15:00] <timotimo> jnthn: it's the core setting compilation (minus optimize)

[15:00] <timotimo> you'd expect that to be huge

[15:04] <timotimo> i forgot to put a "time" in front, i think

[15:04] <timotimo> :S

[15:06] *** brrt joined
[15:07] <timotimo> hmm. i still see many, many brk calls with ever growing addresses

[15:21] <timotimo> i wonder what keeps growing the heap

[15:22] <timotimo> 500 megabytes of profile dump

[15:24] <timotimo> between 200 and 250 kilobytes per seconds being written

[15:55] <timotimo> huh, the frequency of brk calls has increased significantly

[16:07] <timotimo> one gig of profiler data written

[16:08] <nwc10> the only way I was able to profile Test::Harness for the perl core tests was to add compression to Devel::NYTProf

[16:08] <nwc10> this might be what you need here

[16:20] <timotimo> we do want a sort of compression for the profiler

[16:20] <timotimo> but that's more a semantic compression, not really a regular data compression

[18:20] <nwc10> current bytecode version is "4", but we seem to have code supporting back to 2

[18:20] <nwc10> can 2 and 3 go?

[18:22] <jnthn> I think so.

[18:22] <jnthn> We already updated serialization version

[18:22] <jnthn> So there's no way you can run any really old anyway

[18:23] <nwc10> that was my assumption - anything that old will have too old a serialization blob
