[02:15] <cognominal> I have trouble to understand how moar get from the serialization context handle to the path of the corresponding file

[02:17] <cognominal> when I dump a moarvm bytecode, I see the sc handles allright but what about the pathes?

[03:59] <cognominal> probably tracking where the MVMLoadedCompUnitName type is used will give me the answer

[04:07] <cognominal> ok, now everything makes sense. There is explicit code using loadbytecode to load the said other bytecode files :)

[07:43] <brrt> konobi; i'm going to look at it asap

[07:43] <brrt> i'm not going to promise you a solution though

[07:43] <brrt> it's also always possible to require a system lua if minilua won't work on illumos

[08:11] <timotimo> o/

[08:11] <brrt> \o timotimo

[08:11] * brrt is somehwat embarrased by how much better virtualbox works with illumos than qemu

[20:43] <timotimo> i have it open already :)

[20:56] <[Coke]> multiple hangs in jvm test run today. Need to consider giving up the eval server so I can more easily call time on something that's hung.

[20:57] <[Coke]> ww

[22:15] <hoelzro> yay! someone read my blog post!
