[08:03] <nwc10> jnthn: mutex abort: Device or resource busy

[08:03] <nwc10> er, wrong order. that's from ./perl6-m -Ilib t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t

[08:03] <nwc10> ok 51 - Can only be in one whatever block at a time 1..3

[08:03] <nwc10> mutex abort: Device or resource busy

[08:04] <nwc10> oh, paste got a bit mungd

[08:52] <nwc10> that's with ASAN. And also under valgrind.

[08:52] <nwc10> No earlier problems reported

[08:52] <nwc10> it flaps

[14:13] <lizmat> sanity check: it's MVM_JIT_DISABLE to disable the jit, right ?

[14:14] <psch> yes

[14:14] <nwc10> my shell history agrees

[14:19] <lizmat> psch nwc10 thanks

[14:33] <brrt> aye, that is it

[14:33] <brrt> lizmat: anything you suspect to be jit-broken?

[14:39] <lizmat> I was looking at #126842

[14:39] <lizmat> the problem goes away if you do an nqp::force_gc after each run

[14:40] <lizmat> consistently fails in the 77th or the 70th (with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE) run

[14:40] <lizmat> added it to the ticket

[14:44] <brrt> it fails even with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE? then it is certainly a GC issue

[14:44] <brrt> aw.. :-(

[14:44] <brrt> you know what would be evil? randomized GC

[14:47] <timotimo> as a tool for shaking out more failures?

[14:47] <timotimo> force into the open, so to say

[14:48] <timotimo> i think i want an api for bytecode annotations that lets me more or less go through all annotations in a range of pc values

[14:49] <timotimo> would probably be enough to have a second function that gives the next pc with an annotation that comes after a given pc

[14:49] <timotimo> alternatively always put the next annotated pc into the result struct

[14:49] <timotimo> but making a struct like that bigger has an ABI implication

[23:48] <lizmat> jnthn is enjoying some R&R  :-)

[23:49] <konobi> ah... can someone have a look at the last comment on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/306 ?

[23:49] <timotimo> ooooh
