[19:45] <brrt> \o

[19:53] <brrt> seems to me i might have a usuable register allocator now

[19:54] <brrt> and a memory corruption, too ^^

[20:28] <FROGGS> ó.ò

[20:28] <brrt> well

[20:28] <brrt> that's what ASAN is for

[20:29] <brrt> i suspect an error in dynamic array implementation

[20:40] * brrt managed to crash ASAN

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: I think this is a valid register allocation implemnetation.

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Use a 'register ring' for ensuring we can always take a valid

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: new register; for each node ensure again that all children

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: exist in a register. (That is, don't depend on having them

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: after tree traversal, as the computation of one may expel

[20:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: another).
