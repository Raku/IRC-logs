[00:48] <raydiak> turns out it's giving me the array's contents instead of a pointer to it :) just not sure yet precisely where it's going wrong

[03:09] <raydiak> would someone kindly elucidate the '*(void **)ptr' idiom for me? it's hard to google :P

[03:28] <japhb> raydiak: The variable 'ptr' is actually a pointer to a pointer.  So dereference the first level of pointer to retrieve the inner pointer.

[03:29] <japhb> This is often used to allow you to pass a pointer into a function and let the function change it.  So you pass in a pointer to the pointer, and the function does *(void **)ptr = ...

[03:30] <japhb> And then the calling function can see the change.

[03:31] <raydiak> hm...well...this is what breaks my carray csting patch: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/b6f6b29eeac369b9f8fcb0d761fea0f3bebac730

[03:31] <raydiak> *casting

[03:32] <raydiak> so I guess it makes sense, b/c I'm ending up with the array contents instead of a pointer to it

[03:34] <raydiak> but I don't see how that commit I just pasted should even work without other changes elsewhere...???...

[03:35] <japhb> I'm guessing that it originally did not match the code elsewhere, and this fix brought it in line with that other code.

[03:35] <raydiak> ah

[03:36] <raydiak> but we don't have that extra level of indirection in the case of arrays?

[03:36] <raydiak> I guess I'll have to read more now that I kinda understand

[03:36] <japhb> I don't actually know that section of code well; I'm just interpreting the evidence.  ;-)

[03:37] <raydiak> I appreciate the guidance :)
