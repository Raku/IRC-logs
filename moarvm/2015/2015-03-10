[22:32] <timotimo> killing unused guards also doesn't free up space in the deopt table (which is MVM_alloc'd, so a potential win to reclaim stuff there) or the annotations list (where each annotation is spesh_alloc'd, so no win to be had)

[22:33] <timotimo> and removing the annotations when killing a log guard that belongs to it would require going through all annotations and fixing up the indices to deopt table entries

[22:45] <timotimo> hm, my measurements already show that there exist cases where we end up removing more than 10 log-based guards, but that doesn't count guards that get thrown out because whole BBs have been eliminated

[23:54] <timotimo> huh, something's weird about this piece of dump ...

[23:54] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/bc2b12f65bbced5a7d8a - how does BB 2 end up with "2" as one of its successors?
