[02:10] <rjbs> You folks ever have any luck with the problem described here -- http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2014/12/msg223113.html ?

[02:17] <hoelzro> o_O

[02:17] <hoelzro> rjbs: my policy of late has been "valgrind first and ask questions later", but I'm guessing that p5p has tried that already =/

[02:29] <diakopter> rjbs: are you having a problem on mac?

[02:29] <diakopter> rjbs: I mean, isn't that post more than a year old?

[02:59] <rjbs> Still a problem.  only with threads + debugging

[14:34] <diakopter> rjbs: where's that being discussed?

[14:35] <rjbs> p5p, let me find a link

[14:36] <rjbs> http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/12/msg233192.html

[14:36] <rjbs> and http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/12/msg233189.html

[14:42] <diakopter> rjbs: oh, I thought you meant lizmat's reference to "rakudo on MoarVM on OS X has some sort of memory corruption issue as well."

[14:43] *** virtualsue joined
[14:43] <diakopter> (from a year ago)

[15:13] <rjbs> diakopter: Sorry, I meant that I was still having the problem, a year later, that I had then -- which Liz had said, then, that youse also had.

[15:15] *** dalek joined
[15:16] <jnthn> Generally, I've found that concurrency bugs that only show up under debugging are still bugs that *could* happen in release builds, but timing issues make them less likely.

[19:43] <timotimo> i wonder why that had to add an "-fsanitize=address" in there

[19:43] <timotimo> i mean, asan worked before, right?

[19:51] <ilmari> timotimo: because it removed it from the -fno-omit-frame-pointer line

[19:52] <ilmari> although I'm not certain ubsan requires it

[19:53] <timotimo> oh!

[22:14] <[Coke]> of course it's completely divorced from whatever the failure was.

[22:14] <jnthn> urgh

[22:15] <hoelzro> oh joy

[22:25] <[Coke]> hopefully it will on one of the failed tests and I can pin it down.
