[12:00] <brrt> nobody was able to repeat my gc crash i guess :-)

[12:01] * timotimo feels mentally tuit-drained and can't explain why

[12:01] * brrt knows just how that feels :-)

[12:03] <timotimo> it's the worst when you'd have time to code/hack/whatever, but you're just "not feelin' it"

[12:03] <brrt> well.....

[12:04] <brrt> i guess we all went into hacking because it was fun, right?

[12:04] <timotimo> hm. maybe it's worse when you're full of ideas but you don't have time between other commitments

[12:04] <timotimo> i suppose even worse is alternating between only these two states

[12:06] * brrt nods in agreement

[12:06] <brrt> in fact, the only thing that helps (for me) is to just choose something

[12:07] <brrt> and write down ideas for the other things to work out on a later date

[12:07] <timotimo> huh

[12:07] <brrt> notebooks (the paper kind) help for that

[12:07] <timotimo> that suggestion sounds very helpful, actually

[12:07] <brrt> :-)

[12:07] *** pyrimidine joined
[12:07] <timotimo> i do drag a notebook wherever i go

[12:08] <brrt> there you go :-)

[12:08] <timotimo> and not just a moleskine, it's a proper A4 with graph paper

[12:08] <timotimo> hm. leo says graph paper can also refer to "millimetre paper"?

[12:09] <brrt> depends... i used to have 1cm graph paper, now i have 0,6 cm graph paper iirc,

[12:09] <timotimo> 1cm? i can't imagine working with that :)

[12:09] <brrt> it's large, to be fair

[12:09] <timotimo> i think 0.6 is the size pretty much every graph paper you can buy in $random-store around here has

[12:10] <timotimo> anyway. i think what i should commit to for today is trying to get the lexicalref/lexical tests written and perhaps figured out

[12:10] <timotimo> i'll be AFK for a bit and a drive

[12:10] <brrt> isn't it awesome btw how much we've gotten used to variables with a dash in it

[12:10] <brrt> see you

[12:11] <brrt> uhm, by the way

[12:11] <brrt> does it make sense to stash an MVMSpeshGraph into a spesh slot? or even an MVMSpeshBB

[12:11] <brrt> probably not

[12:14] <brrt> because of the GC-ing

[12:17] <brrt> ok, i'm leaving the train now :-)

[12:57] <timotimo> i think i just realized that i don't have to test or implement anything for lexicalref/lexical stuff ... all that already works, doesn't it ... i'm silly

[18:16] <timotimo> i just went out on a limb and more or less turned the lowering back on for lex to local and lexref to localref

[18:17] <timotimo> and i get This container does not reference a native integer

[18:17] <timotimo> strange

[18:18] <FROGGS> so we decont somewhere?

[18:22] <timotimo> well, something used to operate on a lexicalref that now operates on a localref, but something must be set up wrong

[18:23] <timotimo> i probably just missed something

[18:42] *** zakharyas joined
[18:57] <timotimo> but i'm distracted and i'll not be able to work on this too much today, i fear
