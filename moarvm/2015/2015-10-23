[16:11] <TimToady> note: in general, jnthn hates const sprinkling more than the warnings

[16:19] <lizmat> TimToady: but does he hate it because it is tedious work (which would make him happy having it been done already)

[16:19] <lizmat> or is it reading the code with const sprinkled which upsets him ?

[16:20] <lizmat> fwiw, I prefer to see no warnings at all when compiling :-)

[16:23] <[Coke]> the consts tend to cause more trouble than they fix, as I recall.

[16:24] * ilmari would rather have a compile time error when trying to assign through a pointer to const than a runtime segfault when it tries to write to a read-only mapping

[16:24] <[Coke]> and they're infectious - once you start adding them, you can't stop. :|

[16:25] <ilmari> ilmari@garkbit:~/src/moarvm$ ag -w const src/|wc -l

[16:25] <ilmari> 1205

[16:26] <ilmari> I'm sure six more don't hurt

[16:26] <ilmari> sorry, seven

[16:28] <ilmari> I'm no proponent of consting things just because you can

[16:28] <ilmari> but

[16:28] <ilmari> a) big tables actually benefit from being const, since they can be mapped read-only and shared between processs

[16:29] <ilmari> b) "harmless" warnings can mask real problems

[16:30] <TimToady> prior discussion at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2015-09-23#i_11262041

[16:31] <leont> [Coke]: that is even more so in C++. I tend to start my project const-correct, but adding it later is a pain (and even adding as you go can be annoying)

[16:32] <ilmari> I've seen the trouble consting sprees have caused in perl5, so I'm no fan of retroactively consting stuff like function parameters

[16:33] <TimToady> which you just did

[16:33] <ilmari> not for the sake of it

[16:34] <ilmari> I meant stuff like "oh, this function doesn't write modify this argument, let's const it"

[16:34] <ilmari> this was to fix an actual warning, and deconsting the tables to which they point would be wrong

[16:35] <TimToady> well, I'm ambivalent, just trying to stick up for jnthn while he's away :)

[16:36] <TimToady> "stick up for" is an odd English idiom...

[16:36] <TimToady> I guess it's a protest sign metaphor

[16:48] <lizmat> unless someone stops me, I will revert

[16:48] * JimmyZ added the const to the global static var, for some good reason.

[16:48] <JimmyZ> lizmat: I think it is fine to keep it.

[16:49] <JimmyZ> since it is for fixing warnings.

[16:49] <[Coke]> jnthn can revert it when he gets back.

[16:49] <[Coke]> if he wants.

[16:49] <JimmyZ> yeah too.

[16:51] * lizmat considers herself stopped

[16:52] <leont> Wait until you add volatile-correctness to the mix, then it becomes fun ;-)
