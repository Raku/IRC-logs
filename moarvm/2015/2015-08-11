[08:55] <brrt> good morning :-)

[08:57] <jnthn> o/ brrt

[09:00] <JimmyZ> \o

[09:01] <brrt> long work on GLR today?

[09:02] <brrt> i should really blog today

[09:02] <brrt> but i don't know what to write about

[09:03] <jnthn> brrt: No, I got some $dayjob tasks and my YAPC::Asia talk to work at today

[09:03] <brrt> you're going to YAPC::Asia?

[09:03] <jnthn> Aye

[09:03] <brrt> wow

[09:03] <brrt> your cumulative jetlag over the year must be enormous

[09:03] <jnthn> One of the invited speakers, even. :)

[09:03] <brrt> oh, very nice :-)

[09:04] <jnthn> Yeah, I try to keep the longhaul down...

[09:04] <jnthn> Yeah, I'd not be going if it wasn't for the invite, tbh.

[09:05] * jnthn really hopes his sleep continues to improve before he has to do the long flight...

[09:06] <brrt> wow, the english of that

[09:07] <jnthn> I...did something hard to parse? :)

[09:12] <brrt> no, the yapc asia site

[09:13] <brrt> but, cool, good luck there

[09:29] <JimmyZ> japanese?

[09:34] <brrt> i think so

[10:07] <jnthn> Aye

[10:17] <ely-se> Does MoarVM have optimisations for immutable data structures?

[10:20] <jnthn> ely-se: Anything in particular you're thinking of? I can't think of a great deal such things, although the GC is optimized for the use case where most objects quickly die.

[10:21] <jnthn> Which is a good fit for regularly throwing away stuff 'cus you copied rather than mutated

[11:07] <ely-se> Nice.

[11:07] <ely-se> How about TCO? I can't find anything about it.

[11:10] <jnthn> No, we don't do that one.

[11:11] <ely-se> is there functionality to do it yourself?

[11:11] <ely-se> like jumps to other functions

[11:11] <ely-se> like perl5 goto

[11:13] <jnthn> Not really. The best you'd manage at the moment is using the VM extension op interface to hack something up

[11:13] <jnthn> It'd not be hard to all a tailcall op to the VM

[11:13] <jnthn> *add

[11:14] <ely-se> nice

[11:15] <ely-se> I need TCO since my language guarantees it, so I guess I'll go that route

[12:05] *** brrt joined
[12:14] <brrt> hmm.. i have a feeling we should maybe want to clean up branches on MoarVM

[13:13] <brrt> wait, something horribly bad happened to the tiler table generator

[13:14] <jnthn> Oh?

[13:17] <brrt> yes, and i don't yet know what :-(

[13:18] <brrt> it doesn't generate all required rulesets anymore

[13:20] <brrt> not even for the small example grammar

[13:21] <brrt> hmmm

[13:22] <brrt> maybe it's because i uppercased the terminal names

[13:22] <brrt> probably because i uppercased the terminal names

[13:23] <brrt> brrt, you dumb-ass....

[13:24] <arnsholt> It's because you uppercased the terminal names? =)

[13:26] <jnthn> OOPS

[13:26] <brrt> yeah, pretty much

[13:26] <brrt> hmm

[13:26] <brrt> although

[13:26] <brrt> removing that doesn't quite fix the problem yet

[13:30] <jnthn> Maybe there's some titlecasing too? <ducks>

[13:31] <brrt> it's probably some naming issue, yes

[13:39] <brrt> hah

[13:40] <brrt> i removed a lc somewhere while debugging the earlier issue

[13:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: ebe7d4d | brrt++ | tools/tiler-table-generator.pl:

[13:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: Don't uppercase terminal names so early

[13:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit:

[13:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: That interacts rather badly with table generation

[13:42] <dalek> MoarVM/even-moar-jit: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ebe7d4de3b

[13:44] <brrt> hmmm

[13:44] <brrt> i'm wondering how to deal with copy

[13:57] <brrt> hmm, bug found

[14:23] *** brrt joined
[14:30] <brrt> hmm
