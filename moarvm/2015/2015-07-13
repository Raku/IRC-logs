[12:19] <brrt> \o jnthn

[12:19] <brrt> i was looking for you :-)

[12:19] <brrt> still in kiev?

[12:19] <jnthn> No, just home to Prague today

[12:19] <brrt> long flight?

[12:20] <jnthn> 2h

[12:20] <brrt> ah, that's quite reasonable :-)

[12:20] <jnthn> But seem to be running a bit of a temperature today, and also got up early for it, so it felt long anyway...

[12:20] <brrt> ASAN finds me bugs, bugs, bugs

[12:20] <jnthn> ASAN is often right ;)

[12:20] <brrt> :-)

[12:20] <jnthn> At least, I didn't see a case where it wasn't yet

[12:21] <jnthn> ugh, Moar build busted on Windows

[12:21] <jnthn> Well, MSVC ot be specific

[12:21] <jnthn> rc\core\frame.c(974) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'type'

[12:21] <jnthn> src\core\frame.c(975) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'type'

[12:21] <jnthn> and a lot more

[12:21] <brrt> o.O

[12:21] <brrt> hmm

[12:21] <brrt> on master?

[12:22] <jnthn> aye

[12:22] <brrt> i have not built on windows for quite some time

[12:23] <jnthn> Looks like hoelzro is to blame :)

[12:23] <jnthn> But his patch was an overall good, so I won't complain too much :)

[12:24] <brrt> hmm, asan complains about leaks, some of which i know of (but have decided not to care yet)

[12:25] <brrt> but no SEGV's now, so that's something

[14:38] <hoelzro> ahhhhh

[14:38] *** lizmat joined
[14:39] <hoelzro> so Moar builds with C99 on *nix, but C89 on Windows?

[14:39] <jnthn> It's about compiler, not platform.

[14:39] <hoelzro> oh, I see

[14:39] <jnthn> MSVC doesn't do C99 :/

[14:39] <arnsholt> hoelzro: The MS C compiler only implements bits and pieces of C99

[14:39] <jnthn> I read the next MSVC will be better at it

[14:40] <hoelzro> ah yes, I remember hearing that

[14:40] <jnthn> Which is like, OK, progress, but we'll not be able to really take advantage of it for another decade until the older versions that don't do it can be dropped.

[14:40] <hoelzro> heh
