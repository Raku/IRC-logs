[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM:

[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM: This gets us serializing the relation with the parametric type as well

[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM: as the parameters used. On deserialization, this relationship is then

[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM: put back in place. What's missing is parameterization interning, but

[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM: code to detect what things need an entry in the intern section is in

[11:16] <dalek> MoarVM: place; what remains is to write such a table and process it at the

[18:51] * TimToady hopes ASAN is never the copilot on a plane...

[18:51] <nwc10> I'd prefer valgrind - it attempts to keep going on errors

[19:56] <cygx> so, I've got 2 branches sitting around (one allows to load bytecode from meory instead of disk, which is a prerequisite for fakecutables, the other adds a vtable-based embedding API)

[19:56] <cygx> cf https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/master...cygx:fakecutable and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/master...cygx:embedapi

[23:33] * jnthn is happy to be ASAN-clean :)

[23:37] <TimToady> ASANity is overrated... :)

[23:40] <jnthn> It's all part of the daily valgrind...
