[19:18] <FROGGS> This representation (NativeRef) cannot unbox to a native num

[19:18] <FROGGS> progress...

[19:35] <FROGGS> huh, it seems to work O.o

[19:42] <dalek> MoarVM/param-is-rw: fix fetching value from NativeRef

[19:42] <dalek> MoarVM/param-is-rw: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/7cae2cc2ab

[22:26] <timotimo> yays

[22:27] <FROGGS> though, porting the code in nativecallinvoke in nqp to moarvm is kinda hard...

[22:47] <timotimo> :(

[22:47] <timotimo> is it too much?

[22:48] <timotimo> i'm not terribly happy that decont_all is getting even more complex; AFAICT it's already not getting spesh'd at all

[22:50] <timotimo> that AFAICT might have wanted to be a IIRC

[22:58] <timotimo> i ought to get a profile

[23:02] <timotimo> apologies; decont_all *is* getting spesh'd, but not jitted

[23:06] <timotimo> well, at least decont_all doesn't have much overhead in its spesh

[23:21] <timotimo> decont_all also doesn't take terribly much time
