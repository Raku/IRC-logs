[17:18] <timotimo> jnthn: the problem in utf8_c8 is that when UTF8_REJECT is hit on the very first character, (++last_accept_utf8 != utf8) becomes an infinite loop, because last_accept_utf8 is initialized to utf8

[17:19] <timotimo> when i initialize it to utf8 - 1 that specific case works, but i don't know if it's actually correct.

[17:20] <timotimo> a few initial tests suggest it's fine

[17:21] <timotimo> well, oops. :)

[17:23] <timotimo> perl6-m -e 'Buf.new((^255).roll(100)).decode("utf8-c8").say'  -  still quite explosive

[17:24] <timotimo> also when .perl ing that string it blows up

[17:26] <timotimo> and leaving last_accept_utf8 at utf8 but changing != to < breaks, too
