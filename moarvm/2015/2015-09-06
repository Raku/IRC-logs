[09:56] <nwc10> good *, #moarvm

[10:06] <nwc10> as backlogged somewhat, http://pypyvecopt.blogspot.nl/2015/08/the-end-of-summer-pypy-simd.html *is* cool

[10:06] <nwc10> but I don't think that "If I have put the same effort into a different virtual machine, it would have been tied to the language and the virtual machine only." is factually accurate.

[10:07] <nwc10> s/language and the //

[10:07] <nwc10> (surely)

[10:07] <nwc10> and, effectively here, at that level, RPython is a virtual machine.

[10:07] <nwc10> anyway, I like the MoarVM+NQP build times better.

[10:11] <ShimmerFairy> I will say that I'm always pleasantly surprised by how quick building MVM is. I probably don't really need the -j3 even :)

[17:18] <vendethiel> nwc10: it's true this claim is pretty funny, especially considering the biggest VM around is probably the JVM

[18:44] <arnsholt> nwc10: Yeah, in this aspect PyPy is definitely a VM on its own

[18:44] <arnsholt> Although I guess #pypy would prefer a different term for it
