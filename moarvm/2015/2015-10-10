[13:21] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[14:12] *** FROGGS_ joined
[14:34] <timotimo> wow

[14:34] <timotimo> remember when we decided whether to inline or not based on the pre-spesh bytecode size rather than the post-spesh bytecode size?

[14:35] <timotimo> here's a blog post that shows that if a function has lots of bytes in comments, it can get past the "max-inlined-source-size" for v8's optimizer and it won't inline the function, even if it's ridiculously simple

[14:35] <timotimo> so ... if you want efficient code, make sure to make all your var names one character and don't write any comments!

[14:35] <timotimo> %)

[14:57] <leedo> timotimo: got a link? sounds interesting

[15:08] <timotimo> ^ leedo

[15:22] <leedo> thanks!

[15:22] <flussence> jeez... you mean those silly js minifier things actually *do* help performance?

[15:24] *** zakharyas joined
[15:29] <timotimo> only because the decision is made based on a silly metric in this case

[15:36] *** tokuhirom joined
[15:52] <flussence> .oO( I wonder if it's done that way deliberately to give Closure Compiler an unfair advantage )

[15:52] <timotimo> ugh

[15:52] <timotimo> that'd be low.
