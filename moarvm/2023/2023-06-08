[15:04] <timo> i feel our stop-the-world gc is a little bit false advertisement. i have been able to observe the gc happen, so clearly not the whole world is stopped. can we fix this?
[15:05] <Nicholas> I don't know enough to know the answer to the real question, but it's not obvious to me (and hence maybe others), when you write "been able to observe" this, could you clarify how what your code was able to observe
[15:05] <timo> no, my self has been able to observe it
[15:05] <Nicholas> (oh, the gramma in that line isn't quite right - oops)
[15:06] <timo> like, i have an animation that runs at 60fps and i see it stutter when it does gc, so clearly the photons in my room, my eyes, my nerves, my brain, are all still updating while the world is ostensibly stopped for moar to do its gc
[15:07] <Nicholas> aha right. A hammer would fix this? (no-one said how long the "Stop" needed to be, right?)
[15:07] <Nicholas> (there might be laws against this)
[15:07] <timo> ok but what about people standing outside of my window
[15:07] <timo> what about people with telescopes
[15:08] <Nicholas> "bigger hammer"
[15:08] <timo> what if i'm outside and like CCTV is seeing my display
[15:08] <timo> can we ship a big enough hammer with moarvm? how will that affect don
[15:09] <timo> download times, and how much do we pay for traffic?
[15:09] <timo> we will still want to distribute moarvm for free, after all
[15:09] <Nicholas> We've mostly outsourced paying for that to github, hence Microsoft gets to pay?
[15:10] <timo> if it costs microsoft enough, maybe their research division can come up with a cheaper way to stop the world than "apply hammer, forcefully"

[19:01] <nine> I don't think seeing the stutter is evidence for the world not being stopped. Could as well be that the world is stopped, but it quickly catches up on the lost processing time and your brain creates the illusion of having experienced the time while the world was stopped.
[19:14] <timo> wow that's deep

[21:27] <[Coke]> like a gc saccade
[21:33] <timo> once eye tracking hardware gets more commonplace, we'll see techniques like "postpone gc for a few seconds in the hope the user will blink"
