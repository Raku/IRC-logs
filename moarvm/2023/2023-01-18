[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Use right size for a lit_str_idx in JIT and spesh

[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: timo++ noticed at least the JIT mistake while investigating

[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5160, but this change does *not*

[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: fix it.

[01:36] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/6b456a6c05

[01:37] <timo> thanks for doing the commit

[01:37] <tellable6> 2023-01-17T21:28:02Z #moarvm <dogbert17> timo I have updated the issue with some gdb output that might possibly be of interest

[01:37] <tellable6> 2023-01-17T21:29:23Z #moarvm <dogbert17> timo I believe that your Perl6-Github-Linkify script is a bit broken since the master -> main switch

[01:37] <MasterDuke> nice find

[01:38] <MasterDuke> i was intrigued by your lea idea, but i suspect it might not be all that easy to test (or implement)

[01:38] <timo> there's already a tiny piece of optimization in the lego jit that will turn a load + load + add into an add from memory addresses or something like that

[01:39] <timo> but yeah, testing that is probably not terribly easy, and i imagine the win would easily be drowned out by lexical access or boxing/unboxing if the code doesn't get completely lowered into the tightest code we can manage?

[01:45] <MasterDuke> there's so much jit stuff in the news, python might get one, yjit for ruby, etc. unfortunately i don't have the same amount of free time as i did the past couple years

[02:07] <MasterDuke> need to reboot, but not 100% sure the kernel module for my usb wifi adapter has updated successfully. if i'm not back send ethernet cable...

[03:20] <timo> this does not bode well ...
