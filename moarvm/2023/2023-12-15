[15:53] <lizmat> more specifically, adding a: QAST::Var(lexical $/ :decl(contvar)) to the first QAST::Stmts of the block

[15:58] <lizmat> is there a way to get at the QAST of a given block ?

[16:39] <vrurg> lizmat: If it's about RakuAST then I don't think one needs to magle with block's QAST. There must be a generic way to inject things into block.

[16:43] <lizmat> vrurg: no, this is not about RakuAST

[16:43] <lizmat> this is about allowing a hypered map / grep to make sure any regexes inside the block will not interfere with each other

[16:43] <lizmat> this is a runtime decision

[16:48] <vrurg> Apparently, there is no QAST at runtime. 

[16:52] <vrurg> What issue is related to this? I'm trying to figure out something for myself, but would like to see some examples of when it's a problem.

[16:57] <vrurg> Found it.

[17:04] <lizmat> ok, so a way to insert bytecode then  :-)

[18:08] <vrurg> Something close to what I'd consider useful in the context of instantiating generics. ;) But: oops...

[18:09] <vrurg> But I don't think we need it for the $/ case.
