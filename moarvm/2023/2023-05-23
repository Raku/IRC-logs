[11:15] <timo> very weird, even when clicing the tag in the list of branches and tags in the official libuv repo, or when clicking the commit in the releases page, that message pops up

[11:17] <timo> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/b9789a452f814c9f36fe16e15e5f7c1527ec4699  this is the commit that is in the v1.x branch which i think is their main development branch; that is a different commit hash from the one that the release and the tag have

[11:21] <timo> does someone want to cd 3rdparty/libuv; git reset --hard b9789a452f814c9f3; cd ../..; git add 3rdparty/libuv; git commit -m 'use new commit hash for version 1.45.0'; git push

[16:17] <dogbert17> timo: if I wipe my rakudo install and clone it again, i.e. 'git clone https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git', followed by 'perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar' ...

[16:21] <dogbert17> it turns out that the version of MoarVM retrieved is commit 965be0af513f49 which is not the latest one, the latest is 137934244815

[19:49] <timo> oh, haha, perhaps

[19:49] <timo> but we will also probably need to change the commit we have checked out in the submodule
