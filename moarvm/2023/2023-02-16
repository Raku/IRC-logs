[02:21] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: you use rakudo on a windows machine, right?

[02:25] *** frost left
[02:36] <MasterDuke> well, i can get the `got: "MoarVM oops in spesh thread: Unknown handler in inline cache entry\n\n"` fail to repro pretty easily locally, just run t/09-moar/01-profilers.t in a loop with a spectest running in the background

[02:43] <MasterDuke> to no great surprise, disabling the jit doesn't make a difference

[09:37] <timo1> inline caches are a bare-spesh feature, or actually isn't it also used for dispatchers when they are not yet touched by spesh?

[13:46] <jnthn> The inline caches are used regardless of spesh; spesh mines what is in them, though.
