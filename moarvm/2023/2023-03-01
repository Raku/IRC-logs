[01:42] <MasterDuke> that's...unexpected

[01:42] <MasterDuke> and my windows vm doesn't want to start up, yay

[01:44] <MasterDuke> oh, coincidentally i have a virtualbox and virtualbox kernel module update just now. maybe i'll restart in a bit and see if that fixes anything

[03:06] <ugexe> i think i found one clue in that node is explicitly prefixing paths with \\?\

[03:08] <MasterDuke> oh, so it does have some explicit handling of windows? that's sort of annoying that we can't just punt everything to libuv

[03:13] <ugexe> yeah, i guess libuv just removed the max_path limitation but didn't provide automatically handling

[03:18] <ugexe> https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/0597f1b673e247af40759b8778022e7a9f4d8121/lib/path.js#L622-L651

[03:19] <MasterDuke> ugh

[03:19] <ugexe> yeah

[03:22] <[Coke]> sneaky

[03:22] <MasterDuke> where do we want to do that? moarvm/nqp/rakudo?

[03:24] <ugexe> well the old code kind of handled that stuff

[03:24] <ugexe> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1745/files#diff-d0e3def40610627e94609717f733e1385ecf86e8288d0cc48b8f9c51adc0c96eL96-L97

[03:25] <ugexe> and we know that the old code did create the directory, so I suspect it is doing the right thing with \\?. Maybe its worth copying the logic to add that prefix. As for why it errors in other ways, I suspect that similar prefix is needed for other parts of the logic like calls to uv_fs_lstat and whatnot for them to detect the file

[03:27] <ugexe> as for where the toNamespacedPath would ideally live... if you want moarvm to be able to work inside long paths on windows (like someone installs it to a long path) then that would probably be ideal. but looking at the nodejs function it calls that win32.resolve(...) which is rakudo IO::Path logic. so i dunno lol

[03:28] <ugexe> i think just adding a function to prefix paths with \\? if its not a relative path could be the easiest way though

[03:29] <MasterDuke> hm. i thought i could get rid of most of the `#ifdef _WIN32` stuff, but maybe i should just do the minimal change of only changing the actual function that does the work from non-libuv to libuv

[03:30] <MasterDuke> well, don't think i have to focus to try any changes tonight, but thanks for doing the research, i'll give the PR a workover later

[03:32] <ugexe> you might be able to contain all the #ifdef win32 stuff in a single function that is a no-op outside of windows

[03:49] <ugexe> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/7fd7e8264f4430e642ac21dc386aed2f99f5f567/src/win/fs.c#L2705-L2721 - this looks to be how libuv does it in the one spot it needs to

[03:51] <ugexe> worth grepping for LONG_PATH_PREFIX in that same file

[10:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there a reason why https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1724 (and the strongly related https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/781/files) can't be merged?

[10:14] <lizmat> I wouldn't know, pinged jnthn for a review

[18:56] <MasterDuke> timo1, nine: wow, there's something wrong with the profiler and uints. `raku --profile=int_loop.html -e 'my int $sum = 0; for ^1_000_000 -> int $i { $sum += $i }; say now - INIT now; say $sum;'` completes just fine and creates an ~500k profile. changing the two `int`s to `uint`s causes a segfault. if i reduce the loop iterations down to 10_000 it

[18:56] <MasterDuke> completes, but creates a 1.8mb profile

[19:02] <MasterDuke> ah, but i think it's a simple fix

[19:05] <lizmat> MasterDuke: do you see a reason not to merge https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1724 >?

[19:07] <MasterDuke> not really. nine approved it, it looks relatively simple. we can always revert if need be

[19:07] <lizmat> ok, then I'll merge it

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix nqp::objprimunsigned handling of unsigned or sized integers (#1724)

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: This would compare the boxed_primitive flag against

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MVM_STORAGE_SPEC_BP_INT before returning the is_unsigned flag, but this

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: excludes the other sizes of int, as well as uint altogether. Give this

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the same check as nqp::objprimbits; encourage stringy types to default

[19:07] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: to zero themselves.
