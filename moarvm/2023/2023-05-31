[10:06] <lizmat> Tux has problems building Rakudo: https://tux.nl/Files/20230531115808.png

[10:06] <lizmat> I'm not seeing it, does anybody else see this?

[10:55] <timo> do we have a "make realclean" or so?

[10:56] <timo> i'm not sure how git clean -dxf interacts with submodules

[10:56] <lizmat> I suggested Tux to get a new checkout, don't know if he did

[10:57] <dogbert11> a 'make realclean' in the MoarVM dir usually does the trick
