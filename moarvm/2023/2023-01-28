[17:20] <timo1> https://gist.github.com/timo/7789b2322225d6969c61cbc2b00f3331 here's the look at what frames get validated in what order, what other coderefs are mentioned in their bodies, and what is the caller of a frame when it first gets v√§lidated

[17:20] <timo1> 5.5 megabytes text file

[17:21] <timo1> actually, let me shorten the filenames

[17:24] <timo1> https://gist.github.com/timo/d596aab6cc5d813c7823fe12e0ff6da3

[17:28] <timo1> looks like the cur_frame is already the to-be-validated frame, so i need to get the caller or it's always the same

[17:30] <timo1> ah, i got the cause of the symptom wrong

[22:09] <MasterDuke> nine: yeah, i haven't yet gotten around to setting up ethernet in this new place, so bought a cheap usb wifi adapter for the desktop. turns out it needs a 3rd party kernel module, which failed to rebuild after the most recent kernel update. took a bit of manually editing the source to get it working

[22:22] <MasterDuke> timo1: have your recent experiments been inspired by the python optimizations going on? iirc there was something about hard-coding the deserialization of classes, etc that are always part of the runtime?

[22:26] <timo1> haven't heard of that yet
