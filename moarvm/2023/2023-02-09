[02:09] <MasterDuke> hm, what's up with the CI fails?

[02:14] <MasterDuke> oh, i believe tools/build/checkout-repos-for-test.pl is checking out nqp and rakudo from 'master' instead of 'main'

[02:15] <MasterDuke> ok, i'm going to merge my PR, and then will see about fixing checkout-repos-for-test.pl if nobody beats me to it

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: by moving a switch outside of a loop. This means we have to duplicate

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the loop inside each case statement, but the compiler generates better

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: code. For `raku -e ''`, we deserialize almost 90k VMArrays. With

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: `MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1` we go from ~626k to ~623k instructions and with

[02:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: `MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1` from ~1.135b to ~1.132b instructions.

[13:00] <timo1> so the script has been called with "main" but the script didn't understand it, or is there also a configuration change we have to make?

[13:12] <timo1> anyway, good to have ci back, although i have been busy otherwise for so long that i didn't notice
