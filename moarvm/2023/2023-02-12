[03:17] <MasterDuke> so for CI, it looks like a newer ubuntu + a newer clang, but a not-quite-new-enough valgrind means the memory leak tests are failing because valgrind can't read dwarf5. any opinions on how best to pass the '-gdwarf-4' CFLAG option?

[03:17] <MasterDuke> put it in Configure.pl? figure out how to put it in the environment?
