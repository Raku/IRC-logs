[01:39] <MasterDuke> i randomly noticed on the gmp mailing list some discussion about removing abort()s from their code, and https://gmplib.org/repo/gmp/rev/0f5102b5dea7 looks promising

[01:40] <MasterDuke> there hasn't been a new release since the version i've rebased my branch against, but hopefully one will come out soon

[03:02] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: that's a nostly empty page?

[04:07] <MasterDuke> it's a diff, showing abort() being replaced by some __gmp_exception() function

[07:07] <nine> MasterDuke: no protection against typos, vastly larger memory footprint, not possible to deprecate fields or give useful error messages when a field is not available, backwards compatibility concerns when adding fields (because you don't know how the result hash is used). You're right that arrays are a bit better, but only with regards to memory and access speed.
