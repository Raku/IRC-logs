[08:55] <El_Che> patrickb: the rhel/centos 7 build is still broken on 2023.06: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/actions/runs/5421065131/jobs/9856038530

[08:56] <El_Che> 3rdparty/libuv/src/uv-common.h:41:24: fatal error: stdatomic.h: No such file or directory

[09:00] <timo> could that need a compiler flag to make stdatomic support available? like a --std=something to get a sufficiently new version?

[09:03] <El_Che> (on a related note, t/09-moar/01-profilers.t is failing like crazy all around the distros/versions matrix)

[09:03] <El_Che> (rerunning the builds a few times does the trick)

[09:05] <El_Che> timo: stdatomic is only part of rhel/centos 7 and up. It looks like libuv added the dep pretty recently ( we only experienced with the previous release). Weirdly ubuntu 16.04 does not have that problem

[09:09] <timo> oh, if that's not optional in libuv what can we do? is --has-libuv an option for this to use a rhel/centos provided libuv?

[09:09] <patrickb> El_Che: We have to live with that dependency and thus Moar not being buildable with GCC 4.9.

[09:11] <patrickb> All I did was to work around this limitation by installing a newer GCC in the build pipeline on CentOS 7 (using a third party provider). The resulting executables work on vanilla CentOS 7.

[09:11] <El_Che> patrickb: that's fine, but we need to accept that a package can not be built in a "standalone" mode without taking the kitchensink with us. The days of Centos 7 are countered (1 year support left), but a lot of people hang to it because RH killed Centos with Centos8 (stream) for all usefull purposes. 

[09:12] <El_Che> ah, ok, you worked around by changing the build env

[09:12] <patrickb> Yes.

[09:19] <El_Che> patrickb: thank you. I'll see if I can shoehorn that somewhere

[10:43] <El_Che> it looks like ubi and the matching does not have devtoolset-8

[10:45] <El_Che> checking if I want workaround it

[11:36] <El_Che> patrickb: rh being rh, the workaround is more convoluted on ubi than on centos: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/2023.06/actions/buildenv.sh#L56

[11:38] <El_Che> (still a few things to fix on my side though)

[11:49] <El_Che> patrickb: you can trim the size of the VM/container by using devtoolset-8-gcc instead of devtoolset-8

[11:49] <El_Che> thx for the work figuring it out!
