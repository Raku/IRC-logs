[13:08] <ab5tract> compiling fails for me on arch linux: "

[13:08] <ab5tract> linking libmoar.so

[13:08] <ab5tract> /usr/bin/ld: 3rdparty/libuv/libuv.a(linux.o): in function `uv__platform_loop_init':

[13:08] <ab5tract> linux.c:(.text+0x12c0): multiple definition of `uv__platform_loop_init'; 3rdparty/libuv/libuv.a(linux-core.o):linux-core.c:(.text+0x6a0): first defined here

[13:10] <lizmat> that's from a fresh checkout ?

[13:11] <ab5tract> freshly pulled rakudo.git

[13:11] <ab5tract> HEAD is at HEAD is now at 20f4acbca Bump MoarVM for libuv update, MasterDuke++

[13:12] *** linkable6 left
[13:13] <ab5tract> not sure wich repo, that HEAD is referring to, tbh

[13:13] <ab5tract> I also see: HEAD is now at 75fe055c2 Update libuv to version 1.46 (#1761)

[13:14] *** linkable6 joined
[13:18] <ab5tract> I was a bit surprised that the configure script wasn't building the 3rdparty modules from scratch

[13:22] <lizmat> it does for me if I do --gen-moar

[13:22] <ab5tract> strange..

[13:26] <ab5tract> okay, removing gen and nqp seems to have unstuck things

[13:28] <ab5tract> except now when I run make, I get:

[13:28] <ab5tract> +++ Checking for moar NQP version\n print() on closed filehandle $version_file at /home/longwalker/code/raku/rakudo/tools/build/check-nqp-version.pl line 28.

[13:30] <ab5tract> fixed with mkdir -p gen/moar

[13:30] <ab5tract> time for a fresh checkout I guess :)

[13:31] <ab5tract> yeah, deleting gen was a mistake for sure

[18:35] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/orlp/polymur-hash might be good for moarvm. currently we use siphash for our string hashing, but i believe there are now better (i.e., faster with quality at least as good) options, e.g., this, wyhash
