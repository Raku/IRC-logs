[19:30] <ugexe> interesting, libuv just merged io_uring support for linux
[19:37] <jnthn> Hm, as an alternative "backend" or directly exposed in the libuv API?
[19:38] <jnthn> Hm, the first post I find suggests the former, so "free win"?
[19:39] <jnthn> Bad news for us, though: going on https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/d2c31f429b87b476a7f1344d145dad4752a406d4 its only for file I/O, but we don't use libuv for that!

[23:15] <MasterDuke> could/should we now?
[23:38] <ugexe> well previously it was thought that we might as well implement our own thread-pool based async file i/o in Rakudo since that was all libuv did. this io_uring stuff doesn't use the libuv thread pool, and thus might be a bit more attractive, but doesn't work on windows or osx via libuv yet afaik
[23:38] <ugexe> that doesn't really explain if we should now, but more why we didn't use it before
[23:39] <ugexe> there used to by a IO::File::Async or some such on the JVM only though
