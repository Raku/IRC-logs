[13:03] <MasterDuke> nine: https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/10/09/mir-based-jit-prototype-ruby hm, this is the jit you were suggesting we use to replace our current jits, right? hopefully development still continues...
[13:05] <MasterDuke> timo: i assume lizmat was talking about rebuilding nqp and not having to rebuild rakudo. iirc, that didn't use to ever work, but a while ago someone (vrurg maybe?) got it to work in some circumstances
[13:16] <vrurg> MasterDuke: don't remember doing something like this. Not sure if it even legal. :)
[13:18] <MasterDuke> heh. maybe i'm just imagining things

[20:34] <[Coke]> bartolin: I do not miss the days when I was doing this ticket maintenance for... it was probably parrot.
[20:34] <[Coke]> It's good work, thanks for the cleanup!
[20:54] <bartolin> Actually, reading through the old issues and linked conversations brings back some nice memories. IIRC my first commit was still for parrot :)
