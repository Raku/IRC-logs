[06:44] <Woodi> timo1: something like  try { use IPC::Cmd; }; catch { say "IPC::Cmd not found"; exit; }  in Configure.pl ?

[09:08] <timo1> `eval { use IPC::Cmd } or say "oh no";` seems to do be the right way to spell that

[09:11] <nine> No, that's wrong. eval returns the value of the last evaled statement and use doesn't return anything. It's `eval { use IPC::Cmd }; if ($@ ne '') { say "oh no"; }`

[09:11] <nine> You know there's a reason we developed this Raku thing :D

[09:12] <timo1> i'd have just done "use Try::Tiny" but then i'd just get "could not find Try::Tiny in your @INC"

[09:14] <timo1> with your snippet the program won't compile ITher tho

[09:14] <timo1> either*

[09:16] *** sena_kun joined
[09:16] <nine> Oh darn, should have actually looked at the code. It's `eval 'use IPC::Cmd'; if ($@ ne '') { say "oh no"; }`

[09:17] <nine> use is a compile time statement after all

[09:18] <timo1> so if i want to also use the module afterwards, i need to put the check in a BEGIN block as well so i can just "use IPC::Cmd" after it?

[09:20] <nine> Ok, now we're getting to BEGIN { eval { require IPC::Cmd }; if ($@ ne '') { say "oh no"; exit 1 }; IPC::Cmd->import; }

[09:22] <timo1> i think instead of "exit 1" i want to output a custom error message followed by the regular error message that some users may be able to recognize and most users will be able to googlesearch

[09:23] <nine> That's `say "oh no"`'s job.

[09:23] <timo1> oh, does "eval require" spit out the error message?

[09:24] <nine> say { STDERR } "You seem to be missing the IPC::Cmd Perl module. Original error message: $@"; exit 1;

[09:34] <timo1> lol. lmao.

[10:16] <timo1> https://storage.aperture-labs.org/s/Kfng3qeEwjqqCBX nine would you do me the honor of a code review, and creating the pull requests, and also stealing all the credit? :)

[11:49] <Woodi> use in perl5 is perfectly { lexical } ?

[11:51] <Woodi> btw. Configure.pl is pretty "transaction script" approach :)

[11:52] <nine> No, use in Perl is global

[11:54] <Woodi> so maybe it is better to call simple helper scripts that return shell error or crash on lack of module ?

[11:55] <Woodi> perfect would be some perl registry of installed modules but probably just filesystem searching is available ?

[11:59] <Woodi> actually that helper scripts can be generated why needed, at least configure creates mini C programs to test stuff

[11:59] <nine> The perfect is the enemy of the good :)

[14:36] <Woodi> timo1: googling for  checkin mods installed in Perl shows:  perl -MMod::Name -e ''  nice

[14:41] <timo1> how is that helpful

[14:41] <timo1> that'll mean we have to shell out, or at least exec a process

[14:42] <timo1> and there's no guarantee the user has a "perl" in PATH, for example if they used `/opt/myperl/bin/perl Configure.pl` which means we also need to substitute whatever perl was used to invoke the script

[14:48] <nine> What would it solve anyway?

[14:53] <timo1> my patch, or woodi's suggestion for changing my patch?

[14:54] <nine> Changing the patch

[14:54] <Woodi> timo1: just another way and good to know...

[16:30] <MasterDuke> timo1: nice new parse time. i want to upgrade my cpu also, but that would require new mb+ram also...and i want to get the performance upgrade for my car...and all these things cost money...
