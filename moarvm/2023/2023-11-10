[20:26] <lizmat> Nicholas drops by every now and then

[20:32] <jdv> mr nick logan i meant

[20:33] <jdv> but nicholas is cool too:)

[20:33] <jdv> clark i mean

[20:33] <lizmat> yeah, Nicholas Clark goes by Nicholas here nowadays

[20:34] <jdv> is it nclark that did the "ghr"?

[21:08] <ugexe> hmm looks the the moarvm build is ok on CI though

[21:15] <ugexe> that suggests other people have encountered this at some time though

[21:41] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1773

[21:42] <ugexe> I can't actually test if that will fix my error. If I try to build MoarVM without rakubrew it fails to probe my toolchain. For whatever reason rakubrew is able to build all of this, but I wouldn't be able to get it to rerun that build step after modifying the file to test

[21:43] <ugexe> I don't think it can harm anything regardless

[22:07] <ugexe> If someone can merge that I can test that theory

[22:08] <ugexe> i don't think i need anything bumped afterwards

[22:08] <ugexe> since i can do rakubrew build moar-blead --gen-moar=HEAD

[22:23] <ugexe> Same error :/

[23:03] <ugexe> Ok I have the same error trying to build 2023.10 which makes sense since the problematic libuv change was a few libuv bumps back i think

[23:04] <ugexe> patrickb: the above seems similar to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1757 fwiw

[23:39] *** sena_kun left
[23:52] <ugexe> Yeah I can't build rakudo 2023.05 or later (which included the libuv 1.45 bump) on Windows 11 ARM, all with that same "unresolved external symbol _GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime" error
