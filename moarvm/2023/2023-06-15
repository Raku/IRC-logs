[22:49] <ugexe> Would it make sense to expose our stat api more? Like https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/b039b913b6060e2e39f41de71c251a9cc8f3a69d/src/io/fileops.c#L30

[22:50] <ugexe> Such that we can check for multiple parts of that struct instead of making multiple separate nqp::stat calls for each subset 

[22:51] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/3f12927c0c57ceef4917ba959b006171fa276fe3/src/core.c/Rakudo/Internals.pm6#L1388 Seems like itâ€™s stat-ing itself to death (3 different stat calls on the same path)
