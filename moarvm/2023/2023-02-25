[01:04] <MasterDuke> does anybody here know libuv better than i (which isn't hard, i was just trying to figure out what to do from their docs, but was finding them less than great)? if so, any idea what i'm doing wrong in https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1745 ?

[02:00] <[Coke]> MasterDuke++ for getting this VERY close!

[02:03] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: I put together the PR for rakudo to go with this, hopefully was a straigthforward change in that one file.

[02:06] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: yeah, i think that's the exact same diff i have locally (which passed `make m-test m-spectest`, but maybe just because my moarvm was built with `--optimize=0`)

[02:09] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: have you tried a mkdir, or whatever it was that was originally failing for you?

[17:41] <ugexe> MasterDuke: are you on apple silicon by chance? if so i think i could send you a vm image that already has a rakudo built from source (and one built with your PR already), and node installed if you wanted

[17:41] <ugexe> a windows vm image rather
