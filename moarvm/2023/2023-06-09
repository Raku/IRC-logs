[05:52] <Woodi> we have atomics ~everywhere for ~20 years, why it is so hard to safely free objects that are known to be removed ?? bui

[05:53] <Woodi> freeing many-at-once without checking every single one is faster but why gc's are stuck on imposibility ??

[05:54] <Woodi> free gc !

[20:00] <timo> the nursery being freed is already "many-at-once", it's just many objects have some not-gc-managed data to go with it, like strings and big integers

[20:01] <timo> fully inlined p6opaque can disappear at no cost
