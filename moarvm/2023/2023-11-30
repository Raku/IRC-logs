[14:28] <vrurg> Can anybody advise me with debugging attributes on P6opaque? I've got a case where one gets a value from "nowhere". I tried tracing attribute changes in bindattr, atomicbindattr, and casattr but none is involved. And yet, attribute value persistently changes at runtime.

[22:24] <vrurg> It's about deserialization. Again. :(
