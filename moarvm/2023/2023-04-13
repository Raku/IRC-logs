[11:08] <timo1> who wants to write a little check for moar and nqp's Configure.pl to see if a specific perl module is installed, because some distros (looking at you fedora) ship perls that don't have ExtUtils::FindBin, or IPC::Cmd, or Digest::SHA

[11:09] <timo1> checking for those in Configure.pl would mean an earlier, less confusing, and possibly well explained crash rather than dieing in the middle of mak

[19:39] <timo1> Woodi: how do you mean?

[19:40] <timo1> nine: i'm told in retrospect it was perhaps a poor choice, but it's an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X

[19:42] <nine> I'd be super curious how the X3D would fare in comparison

[19:47] <timo1> i put an enormous cooler from noctua on it

[19:48] <nine> I probably got the same one :)

[19:48] <timo1> nh-d15 or something? i can never remember

[19:48] <timo1> but it's basically the biggest one, with two fans

[20:00] <nine> that's it, yes

[20:06] <timo1> everybody loves this cooler

[20:07] <timo1> i wanted to experiment with a different distro this time and i couldn't be bothered to properly make space on my SSDs so now i have turned my bequiet! case into a beloud! case by screwing and ziptieing an HDD to the top shelf
