[16:09] <[Coke]> Team - I was going to make the change from master to main but only too late realized I didn't have privs. Neither does lizmat. I'm sure jnthn does, but is there anyone else who has access to Settings on the github project?

[16:13] * nine doesn't have those either

[20:36] <[Coke]> .ask jnthn Hi - we've switched over Raku & nqp to use 'main' instead of 'master' - any chance you can do the same on MoarVM (or add someone as an admin?) - thanks!

[20:36] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to jnthn
