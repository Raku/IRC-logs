[19:23] <dogbert17> I'm wondering if something is flaky when our CI-system runs t/09-moar/01-profilers.t. It failed on my libuv PR but a but also on cygx++ unrelated PR that he posted the other day.

[19:23] <dogbert17> Has anyone seen this before or are we dealing with something that has been broken by the PR's themselves?
