[09:35] <timo1> it occurs to me we don't have a good hash for the situation of "i have a terabyte of ram and would like to store what fits in two thirds of a terabyte of data including free slots according to the load factor" because our hash grows always to 2**n sizes
[09:43] <nine> Arguably we're not in a position yet to process anything in quantities of terabytes...
[09:44] <timo1> maybe we can start with nqp and see how our vm behaves "in theory"
