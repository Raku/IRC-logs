[09:58] <lizmat> sanity check: is --with-nqp actually supposed to work?

[09:58] <lizmat> I have an NQP checkout with an installed nqp in install/bin

[09:59] <lizmat> I use that nqp bin as argument in Rakudo with Configure.pl

[09:59] <lizmat> the nqp binary works

[10:00] <lizmat> I configure and make install Rakudo, it installs a "rakudo" in the nqp/install/bin

[10:00] <lizmat> however, running that only yields:

[10:00] <lizmat>  % install/bin/rakudo           

[10:00] <lizmat> zsh: killed     install/bin/rakudo

[10:04] <lizmat> MasterDuke Nicholas nine any pointers ?

[10:08] <Nicholas> this is macOS? I don't know why something would be "killed" (such a helpful message) but is that binary dynamically linked against a shared library (the rakudo shared library) but that library can't be found?

[10:09] <Nicholas> I've been tending to avoid --with-nqp

[10:09] <Nicholas> but, hmm, if it "installed" it properly, then that's the "installed" version, and surely that means the relevant library it's trying to find is also in the correct installed location

[10:10] <Nicholas> (ie you're not trying to run the uninstalled binary from its build tree. That's where all the "library not found" fun usually starts)

[10:12] <lizmat> yes, MacOS

[10:13] <lizmat> Nicholas: another way to be able to easily make changes to NQP in an installed Rakudo ?

[10:13] <lizmat> trying to figure out why https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5387  

[10:13] <Nicholas> I don't know. I tended to be building all of NQP and Rakudo just to verify MaorVM

[10:14] <lizmat> understood

[10:16] <lizmat> I guess I will have to revert to nuking everything, configuring everything, installing everything and installing all the modules that I need again and again

[10:16] <lizmat> which ups the dev cycle from 1 minute to several minutes :-(

[11:59] <[Coke]> Nicholas: hi!

[12:00] <lizmat> found the solution to the underlying problem: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/adfdef88ef

[12:03] <Nicholas> \o/

[12:32] <ugexe> yes, --with-nqp is supposed to work. i believe it is what e.g. debian packagers use

[12:33] <lizmat> thanks for the confirmation....  I'll report again when it crashes again

[15:29] <timo> lizmat: what do you mean by "make changes to nqp in an installed rakudo"?
