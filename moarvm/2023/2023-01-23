[09:16] <timo> you probably have a better idea than me / already know details about this topic: using lea instructions instead of add; when is it worth it, can the exprjit be easily taught how to apply it just by making a proper tile? can we fuse an a + n * b in the assembly into a lea when we see it without a more complicated optimization pass?

[09:25] <timo> i even saw something like "5 * n turns into n + 4 * n"

[10:18] <nine> Before adding new features I'd rather like the expr jit to be fixed... It is known to generate racy code and I simply gave up on trying to fix that.

[12:04] <timo> oh oops

[12:04] <timo> what does it race with? like, when you try to write code that works with atomics it re-orders things against your wishes?

[12:05] <timo> (but also, maybe there is a tuit shaped like lea from someone who can't do the racyness fix, and maybe brrt has a tuit shaped like explaining the lea thing, etc)

[12:05] <timo> ... where are my tuits?

[12:05] <timo> both in a literal, and a metaphorical sense

[13:12] <nine> (template: gethow

[13:12] <nine>   (let: (($how (^getf (^stable $1) MVMSTable HOW)))

[13:12] <nine>   (if (nz $how)

[13:12] <nine>     $how

[13:12] <nine>     (call (^func MVM_6model_get_how)

[13:12] <nine> ...

[13:12] <nine> You would think that we're fetching $how once into a register, check it and then return it. But in reality this generates 2 mov instructions reading from that memory location, resulting in a TOCTTOU race condition
