[16:25] <lizmat> so, I just found something weird:

[16:25] <lizmat> sub a($a) { if $a -> $b { $b } }; a(42) for ^3000000

[16:26] <lizmat> sub a will *NOT* get inlined because:

[16:26] <lizmat>     a BB(2, 192 bytes) -> BB(3):

[16:26] <lizmat>       target has a :noinline instruction - ins: takeclosure
