[10:31] <lizmat> MoarVM contributor Ben Davies has passed away: https://www.tributearchive.com/obituaries/27062822/benjamin-nelson-davies
[11:07] <jnthn> That's sad news. :( Not just MoarVM, but worked over the whole Rakudo stack.
[11:08] <jnthn> Especially helped with BSD support and socket-y stuff.
[11:33] <nine> This is as sad as it is unexpected :(
