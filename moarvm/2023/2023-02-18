[02:23] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: i don't really know, i'm going off of what azure has, which is just windows server 2019 and 2022

[02:41] <ugexe> MasterDuke: just a wild guess, but I wonder if the path to VS changed. Yours using 'Program Files (x86)' still, but when I look at when I updated my appveyor files I see I stopped using (x86) - https://github.com/ugexe/zef/commit/448863824627dcf44451e09ce5cbbd5377649cf4

[02:42] <ugexe> so maybe the detection here isn't working because vswhere.exe is in that different path - https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/0454ab39e86e7b55b13b95630c983cefeb3d3a0e/azure-pipelines.yml#L12-L13

[02:43] <MasterDuke> thanks, i'll try messing around with that

[02:51] <ugexe> MasterDuke: I just looked on a windows 11 VM with VS 2022 and vswhere is in that 86 location, so I guess thats not it

[02:51] <MasterDuke> hm, that led me to some more googling which suggests vswhere + azure + windows 2022 are problematic and i don't think can easily be fixed by only changing paths

[02:52] <MasterDuke> e.g., https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere/issues/250

[02:52] <MasterDuke>  i think i'm going to back the windows change out of the pr, that can be handled later by someone who knows more about them than i do

[02:54] <ugexe> i wonder what vswhere.exe is outputting on azure

[16:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Work around "const_iX NYI" after getlexstatic_o with fallback resolver

[16:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[16:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: getlexstatic_o and sp_getlexstatic_o did not take into account that
