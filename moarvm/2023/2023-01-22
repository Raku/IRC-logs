[20:00] <timo> who wants to check out if in theory starting to validate a frame mentioned in a frame we're currently validating in a separate thread can make stuff faster or is mostly wasted effotr

[20:00] <timo> i feel like digging out and refreshing the tracery stuff can give a good look at the timeline there

[20:03] <timo> maybe checking how often a frame mentioned in another frame is validated very soon thereafter is a good starting point, then looking if there's a cheap way during validation to see if something is likely to be hit based on previous (or maybe following) instructions, like in order to identify stuff happening in rarely taken error branches

[20:20] <timo> alternatively, how much would it be worth to have a hand-crafted or at-build-time-measured-and-injected list of frames that we always run through when rakudo starts

[20:23] <timo> i'm still working off the fact that during 3.37% of the main thread's time for an empty program the MVM_validate_static_frame, though what i remembered was 5%, which is actually in prepare_and_validate_static_frame, haven't looked what the difference is

[20:25] <timo> prepare_and_verify_static_frame*

[20:30] <timo> prepare_and_verify_static_frame assumes we hold the CU deserialize frame mutex, which sounds like it needs resolved if we want to validate two things at the same time
