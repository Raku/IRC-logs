[08:05] <nine> MasterDuke, vrurg: actually NQP and Rakudo builds should be reproducible. I.e. a simple rebuild of NQP without changes should neither trigger a rebuild of rakudo nor cause any runtime problems. We certainly were in that state once (well maybe with some super rare hidden bug still) but I fear we have regressed a bit.

[12:53] <[Coke]> Wonder if we need a more complicated CI that can detect that.
