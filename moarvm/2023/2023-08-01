[11:02] <patrickb> Hi there! There is currently no way to receive a native callback from a library that spaws its own threads, right?

[11:02] <patrickb> "MoarVM panic: native callback ran in thread (12345) unknown to MoarVM" is the corresponding error...

[11:03] <patrickb> I'm now thinking how to quickest get a thread switcher working in C land...

[22:34] <Voldenet> hacky solution would be using something like https://github.com/tylertreat/chan to send data from native thread to moarvm thread
