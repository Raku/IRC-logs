[12:17] <lizmat> meh... building NQP appears to be broken even *before* this merge

[12:18] <lizmat> % perl Configure.pl --backends=moar

[12:18] <lizmat> Updating submodules .................................... OK

[12:18] <lizmat> ===ATTENTION===

[12:18] <lizmat>   No --prefix supplied, building and installing to /Users/liz/Github/nqp/install

[12:18] <lizmat> this per instructions in the README

[12:18] <lizmat> patrickb ^^ ??

[12:18] <lizmat> vrurg_ ^^ ??

[12:25] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/792

[12:26] <nine> lizmat: shouldn't you give it a --prefix?

[12:27] <lizmat> never have needed that before. *and* it is not written in the README

[12:27] <nine> I assume you have not configured MoarVM with --prefix=/Users/liz/Github/nqp/install

[12:28] <lizmat> Ah... I now realize I did --gen-moar in the past

[12:28] <lizmat> It's been a while

[12:30] <lizmat> I guess I was too much triggered on any Unicode fallout
