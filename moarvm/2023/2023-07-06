[16:34] <timo> io_uring is cool

[16:35] <timo> you basically have a buffer in which you can pass io-related commands to the kernel and receive results back without doing any context switches between user mode and kernel mode because the kernel can be doing the tasks at any time on a different core

[16:36] <timo> and these commands have some extra things in it to allow more chaining

[22:28] <Voldenet> io_uring is cool especially on raw sockets, where zero-copy transmission could be used everywhere, but good old epoll can be as fast in some cases

[22:31] <Voldenet> but io_uring outperforms it frequently on top of being more flexible
