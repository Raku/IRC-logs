[13:58] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/05/22/2023-21-maxcinating/

[14:11] <nine> lizmat: no the submodule update needs to be done locally. I think that's also done by Configure.pl

[14:11] <lizmat> well, I did run Configure.pl, several times actually

[14:13] <lizmat> sadly, nothing in the Compiler.verbose-config shows a libuv version info

[14:15] <lizmat> the Changelog in my nqp/Moarvm/3rdparty/Changelog says: 2022.03.09, Version 1.44.1 (Stable)

[14:15] <lizmat> so I guess it didn't update  :-(

[14:44] <nine> With or without submodule update?

[16:43] <dogbert17> if, when standing in the MoarVM dir, I run e.g. 'perl Configure.pl --debug --prefix=../../install/' the following git stuff related to submodeles is run:

[16:43] <dogbert17> git submodule sync --quiet

[16:44] <dogbert17> git submodule --quiet init

[16:44] <dogbert17> git submodule --quiet update

[16:46] <dogbert17> checking, with e.g., 'git log' in the 3rdparty/libuv directory shows 'commit e8b7eb6908a847ffbe6ab2eec7428e43a0aa53a2 (HEAD, tag: v1.44.1)'

[17:32] <lizmat> which is the wrong version, right?

[17:33] <dogbert17> yep

[19:05] <dogbert17> one thing that might point to me having done something stupid is that if you click the libuv link on this page: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tree/main/3rdparty the foolowing message pops up

[19:05] <dogbert17> "This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository."

[21:15] <[Coke]> might we have to clean up and force push?
