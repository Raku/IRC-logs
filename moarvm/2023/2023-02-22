[01:42] <MasterDuke> hm. so readdir() returns '.' and '..', but uv_fs_readdir does not

[01:51] <Voldenet> actually, readdir doesn't have to return '.' and '..'

[01:51] <Voldenet> libuv filters it out https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/5047b344/src/unix/fs.c#L666

[01:51] <Voldenet> but it's not safe to assume that readdir does return those two entries

[01:53] <MasterDuke> well, we have some tests in roast that assume raku's dir() does

[01:56] <MasterDuke> well, if you pass `:test`

[01:56] <MasterDuke> npq::nextfiledir does return them by default

[02:10] <MasterDuke> oh, rakudo fakes them for jvm. maybe we can just make that the default behavior https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Rakudo/Iterator.pm6#L1468-L1627

[02:21] <Voldenet> either way, altering those entries and expecting specific behaviours leads to utter lunacy

[02:22] <Voldenet> where every layer either removes or adds those…

[02:30] <Voldenet> fwiw python's os.listdir removes those

[16:18] <[Coke]> masterduke made some progress on libuv updates (yay) but there's now a problem linking against libuv against one of the unix/* files (which hasn't come up before, and oddly, there's a win/ variangt of th same file)
