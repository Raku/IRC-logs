[19:25] <MasterDuke> looks at what node does for mkdir and what my pr does, i'm not really seeing any significant differences. now i haven't read/written c++ in quite a while, so maybe i'm missing something

[19:25] <MasterDuke> *looking at

[19:49] <ugexe> MasterDuke: from my notes somewhere its important to note that rakudo without your PR will create the directory, but it will report that it doesn't exist if you check with .e or try to create a file/directory in that new path

[19:50] <ugexe> so its possible that the difference in how node vs moarvm use e.g. uv_fs_stat

[19:51] <ugexe> also important to note that node is able to correctly report the existence of the new long directory as well

[20:20] <MasterDuke> ugexe: right, thanks, i'd forgotten you'd mentioned that

[20:21] <MasterDuke> it does also create the directory with my pr, correct?

[22:41] <ugexe> No it doesnâ€™t 

[22:41] <ugexe> which seems

[22:41] <ugexe> bizarre
