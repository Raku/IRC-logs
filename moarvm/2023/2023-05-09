[10:19] <jnthn> [Coke]: Given you Maintain access, which hopefully is enough to complete it

[10:19] <tellable6> 2023-05-08T20:36:16Z #moarvm <[Coke]> jnthn Hi - we've switched over Raku & nqp to use 'main' instead of 'master' - any chance you can do the same on MoarVM (or add someone as an admin?) - thanks!

[12:35] <xiaomiao> heyhey. I was wondering why there's no tarballs for the 2023.04 release (and cooking one from github with submodules is mildly very irritating :) )

[12:40] <lizmat> xiaomiao https://rakudo.org/downloads show tar balls ?

[12:46] <xiaomiao> lizmat: no standalone moarvm tarballs

[12:46] <lizmat> aaah... moarvm

[12:47] * lizmat missed the channel this was on

[12:47] <xiaomiao> :)

[12:47] <lizmat> jnthn http://moarvm.org misses the 2023.04 tarbals

[12:55] <jnthn> lizmat: Need to ask whoever did the release; that hasn't been more for years.

[12:55] <lizmat> jdv did that

[12:56] <jnthn> Maybe they forgot to push the update of the site or some such...

[12:56] <lizmat> .tell jdv do you know why there aren't any 2023.04 tarballs on moarvm.org ?

[12:56] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to jdv

[13:55] <timo> i see the tarball and the link in the releases page in the moarvm/moarvm.org repo on github

[13:55] <timo> assumedly there's a cron job somewhere that uploads fresh commits of that repo to the page?

[13:59] <timo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/release_guide.md here step 17 is "make sure both pages look alright" after in step 16 you "commit release to moarvm.org repo and check moarvm.org after 5-10 minutes" so i'm assuming here's an automated step in between that didn't happen

[19:46] <jdv> probably my fault

[19:46] <tellable6> 2023-05-09T12:56:36Z #moarvm <lizmat> jdv do you know why there aren't any 2023.04 tarballs on moarvm.org ?

[19:51] <jdv> oh timo is right.  that's downstream from me.

[19:52] <jdv> idk how that site updates.  who does?

[19:52] <jdv> rba: is that you?

[21:17] *** sena_kun left
[21:23] <jnthn> Ah, it just pulls the repo every so often in a cron job, but turns out that GitHub's server key change busted it
