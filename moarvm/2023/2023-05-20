[16:12] <dogbert17> nine++, many thanks

[16:12] <nine> Well you did the actual work :)

[16:13] <dogbert17> perhaps it's unavoidable but after have made the changes I always have to do a 'make realclean' in the MoarVM dir in order for the build to work

[16:38] <lizmat> guess I'll bump NQP and Rakudo now as well

[16:39] <lizmat> well, later today

[16:43] <dogbert17> ++lizmat

[18:00] *** reportable6 left

[18:41] <lizmat> so done https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fac61c28ed

[19:19] <dogbert17> lizmat++, does it work for you. If my memory still works you're on a Mac right?

[19:19] <dogbert17> I couldn't test that 

[19:35] <dogbert17> something seems off, if I wipe my install, clone rakudo and build it, the new libuv isn't there !?

[22:01] <lizmat> dogbert17 I spectested it, didn't look whether it fetched a new libuv or not

[22:03] <lizmat> from the build log, does look like it didn't fetch a new libuv

[22:12] <dogbert17> I wonder if I did something wrong
