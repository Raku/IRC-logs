[13:23] <[Coke]> oooh, nifty

[15:27] <[Coke]> if we have a moarvm patch that requires a rakudo patch... does the rakudo patch have to include the nqp/moarvm bumps, or is that a separate task done by the merger?

[15:28] <lizmat> well, there could be associated PRs in nqp and rakudo

[15:34] <[Coke]> yes, and should those PRs have the bump or no?

[15:35] <[Coke]> Or just the code change?

[15:35] <[Coke]> (since at the time the PR is submitted, they don't have the ref id of the change in the lower part of the stack)

[15:35] <lizmat> having the bump in there could complicate things

[15:35] <[Coke]> ... I think I just answered my own question

[15:35] <[Coke]> (going to submit the rakudo change on masterduke's moarvm change, once I've tested it with the typo fix)

[15:37] <lizmat> :q

[15:45] <[Coke]> sadly that PR doesn't work here.

[15:48] <ugexe> fwiw how i'd test that PR is: rakubrew the latest rakudo, cd to ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.13/nqp/MoarVM, apply the PR, run make install, cd to ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.13, and run make install. I dunno if thats useful

[15:49] <ugexe> rakubrew the latest rakudo, cd to ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.13/nqp/MoarVM, apply the PR, run make install, cd to ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.13, make the changes to rakudo, and run make install 

[15:49] <ugexe> rather

[15:57] <[Coke]> added https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5215 but mainly just as a placeholder for now. will double check testing once the MoarVM issues are resolved.

[16:08] <ugexe> oh i misunderstood, i thought that PR already exists. nevermind me

[16:08] <ugexe> s/exists/existed/

[18:53] <nine> I do usually include the bump (I just update it before merging) and I think that's the better way because it makes it very clear that the patch needs an associated change in the VM. It also increases bisectability.
