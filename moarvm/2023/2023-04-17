[12:03] * Nicholas is avoiding the Internet (or trying to look like it) but not today, as it's still counting down to "Excitement Guarenteed" -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5QXreqOrTA

[12:04] <Nicholas> (strictly true - you only reach T=0.00 if the engines light and the computer doen't call an abort at fractionaly before zero)

[12:06] <Nicholas> https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1925 -- With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them as they fly overhead.

[12:07] <Nicholas> it's that, or reading https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/assignment-operators.html#operator_assign-value to figure out why someone chanted `=` to `:=`

[12:07] <Nicholas> (MySQL is not the first choice of database for most anyone at $ork. But legacy...)

[12:09] <Nicholas> oh. apparently I now have an extra 1h20m to figure that out...

[13:13] <nine> And it's a scrub

[13:24] <Nicholas> and 48 hours from now I have a meeting.

[14:36] <[Coke]> Nicholas!
