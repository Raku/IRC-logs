[00:53] <MasterDuke> huh. why would something take longer with just MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE=1 than with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 ?

[00:56] <MasterDuke> timo1: i did try adding `&& arg_type != MVM_CALLSITE_ARG_INT` to the conditional, but that just caused a segfault, and i didn't investigate that further

[00:57] <MasterDuke> i sort of hope there's a solution that gets us to specializing for uint, not int

[00:57] <MasterDuke> :q

[00:57] <MasterDuke> ww

[01:01] <MasterDuke> something about the facts gathered perhaps?

[01:19] <MasterDuke> ugh. i looked at pretty much everywhere a `*_i` op is used and added something for `*_u` if it wasn't there already, but still no change

[01:20] <MasterDuke> in src/spesh/*

[01:43] <timo1> "no change" from "causes a segfault"?

[02:38] <MasterDuke> "no change" eq "no segfault, but not any faster"

[02:40] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/7c8c1862d593a8ea09e84051c6d2f435 should be my current diff

[02:53] <MasterDuke> updated with some jit addition

[10:00] <timo1> does MVM_op_get_mark update correctly when update_ops runs?

[10:03] <timo1> in jit_emit_primitive, do we have to use a different mov for p6Ã²get_u32 to get the right sign extend behaviour?

[13:55] <timo1> if you post a bit of spesh log maybe with a function that used to bail arg spesh because of uint and now succeeds, and maybe if that same frame ever gets mentioned as inlined? i can take a look later
