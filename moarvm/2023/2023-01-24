[10:07] <timo> we used to have code to pick apart a moar file into its pieces written in raku, i think it was a gist

[10:07] <timo> but it didn't read the moar bytecode

[10:19] <timo> maybe the phaser that doesn't run code should be called RUN'T

[10:32] <nine> timo: you mean this? https://gist.github.com/niner/63a718023aba72e0dffc39c1ccd84e32

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <:(*@args, *%kwargs)> specifically i want the equivalent of python dis a module that takes things containing raku code and gives their bytecode representation

[11:48] <nine> what for?

[12:00] *** reportable6 left
[12:03] *** reportable6 joined
[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <:(*@args, *%kwargs)> educational purposes ðŸ™‚

[12:32] <nine> What use case would this support where moar --dump isn't sufficient?
