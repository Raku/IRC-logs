[01:37] <MasterDuke> oh nice, i'll try just adding that to the pr

[02:01] <MasterDuke> huh. `MoarVM panic: Can't JIT opcode <sp_fastbox_u_ic>` when run normally, but completes just fine (though not any faster) in gdb

[02:02] <MasterDuke> nevermind, that was an easy fix

[02:03] <MasterDuke> still not faster though...
