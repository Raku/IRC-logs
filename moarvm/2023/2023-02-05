[14:53] <timo1> https://bpa.st/FJCIC here's a tiny bit of measurement for what happens when i replace "validate a frame" with "set its validated state to true", i.e. the maximum win from any amount of optimization of the validation itself

[14:56] <timo1> i think it's about 0.15 vs 0.14 seconds wallclock

[14:57] <timo1> i might be barking up the wrong tree here

[16:12] <timo1> https://pasteboard.co/TUvaMHFJr3Nc.png  how's that for an amazing optimization

[16:14] <timo1> i wonder why it uses one register for each object it stores in that package rather than reusing one. perhaps the nqp mast compiler not freeing a register early enough somewhere?

[16:14] <timo1> perhaps an Stmt instead of Stmts or the other way around in the qast
