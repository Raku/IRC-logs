[01:05] <MasterDuke> heh, finding just that bit is the hard part

[01:06] <MasterDuke> re jit_emit_primitive, i wasn't 100% sure, but i figured that's something spectests might catch. anyway, the jit really isn't coming into play for this code

[01:07] <MasterDuke> which btw, is just `MVM_HASH_RANDOMIZE=0 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 raku -e 'my uint $sum = 0; for ^100_000_000 -> uint $i { $sum += $i }; say now - INIT now; say $sum;'`

[01:09] <MasterDuke> virtualbox and kernel update, time to reboot and hope my windows vm works again. should be back in a couple min

[01:37] <MasterDuke> ugh, windows vm still won't start

[02:12] <MasterDuke> hm, i see a couple `reprop (decont|getattr|bindattr)_u unsupported in P6Opaque (Int|MoarVM::StringHeap)` in the uint spesh log, but none in the int spesh log

[02:12] <MasterDuke> i've never seen that message before

[02:21] <MasterDuke> well, got rid of those messages, but still no faster...

[05:00] <MasterDuke> gist updated with those repr changes

[21:39] <ugexe> MasterDuke: not exactly libuv related per-se, but https://gist.github.com/ugexe/5bb5683a90f4ad1c1daeca6d96bac4cc shows that manually prefixing the path with \\?\ for the nqp::stat call allows it to see the file exists

[23:29] <ugexe> your PR works if I prefix the paths as well
