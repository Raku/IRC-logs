[00:30] <MasterDuke> looks like maybe the lastest libuv bump broke the mingw build https://dev.azure.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/_build/results?buildId=1308&view=logs&j=996c8d9f-685e-5e0a-1455-2f4f9d883a28&t=de99d75b-d7ac-545d-b29c-dd3a2d759eae&l=870

[00:30] <MasterDuke> or had this happened a little while ago?

[01:04] <japhb> MasterDuke: It would be useful to me to be able to turn off libuv io_uring support at build time on certain systems, but I lost track of how to make that work mid-yak-shave.  If you happen to be in there figuring out libuv build gymnastics, can you take a look at that problem too?

[01:05] <MasterDuke> well, i'm going to ignore mingw right now. i think libuv has stopped supporting it, so our options are limited/not good

[01:07] <MasterDuke> i'm busy cursing the amount of `#?if moarvm` i need to add to my rakudo pr, so not planning to play around with libuv building, but i'll keep it in mind

[01:16] <ugexe> MasterDuke: do you think there is a way for the jvm to support it in the future?

[01:18] <ugexe> obviously the jvm can do stat calls, but i assume the problem is it doesn't implement the same dispatch thing

[01:19] <MasterDuke> yeah. istr, i found an nqp commit where nine put in some dispatch stub for the jvm, but it doesn't do anything

[01:21] <MasterDuke> so theoretically rakudo might build on the jvm with the pr as is, but it wouldn't run
