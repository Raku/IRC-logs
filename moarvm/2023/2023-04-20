[09:05] <nine> Nicholas: oh thanks! I'd have forgotten about that
[09:10] <lizmat> 3 hours!
[09:12] <Nicholas> oh, verb. Oops. I fail at English.

[12:35] <lizmat> possibly  :-)

[12:44] <lizmat> hehe... Nicholas was prescient
[12:46] <Nicholas> I assumed Monday would repeat
[12:48] <lizmat> unpaused
[12:48] <Nicholas> fun! excitement! hold music!
[12:48] <Nicholas> I'm going to make coffee
[12:52] <nine> That's actually not bad coding music :D
[12:53] <Nicholas> and ice cream, pimped with https://www.interspar.at/shop/lebensmittel/spar-mini-schoko-schmetterlinge-weisse-zartbitter-schokolade/p/2020003022722

[13:33] <timo> countdown on hold
[13:33] <timo> countdown is on not hold
[13:33] <timo> and up it goes
[13:34] <vrurg> yep!
[13:34] <nine> \o/
[13:35] <vrurg> 4 engines are seemingly haven't started
[13:35] <timo> is that a smiley face on the underside of the rocket
[13:37] <timo> is this fine?
[13:38] <nine> I think that was normal. Looked too symmetrical to be coincidence and the commentators didn't mention it at all
[13:38] <timo> sounds like they have reached a few stretch goals and scuttled the device
[13:40] <vrurg> Not that they wanted this, but wasn't ruling it out.
[13:41] <vrurg> "rapid unscheduled disassembly" â€“ :D
[13:41] <Nicholas> it sort of is and isn't, if the cause is someone pushing the button to fire the Flight Termination System
[13:42] <Nicholas> (which might have been the cause of the actual final boom)
[13:43] <timo> sure hope it was worth rushing the engineers to make a 420 launch
[13:45] <timo> not saying another month or two would have guaranteed that the separation of the booster would have worked
[13:45] <nine> First attempt was on 4/18, so the 420 thing, doesn't really make sense
[13:46] <nine> Err... 4/17
[13:47] <timo> aw ok. that would have been a funny story tho
