[11:03] <dogbert17> is anything happening here?

[11:04] <Nicholas> humans say "good morning" and bots flap.

[11:05] <dogbert17> well, good morning then Nicholas

[11:05] * dogbert17 is not a bot

[11:05] <Nicholas> we haven't yet figured out how to harness the energy of the flapping and convert it into useful work.

[11:06] <dogbert17> Nicholas, does this look familiar?

[11:06] <dogbert17> MoarVM oops in spesh thread: Malformed DU chain: writer getlexref_i8 of 40(11) in BB 41 is incorrect

[11:06] <dogbert17> Spesh of '<unit>' (cuid: 76, file: t/04-nativecall/15-rw-args.t:1)

[11:06] <dogbert17> Callsite 0x7fcb1fc2b110 (0 args, 0 pos)

[11:06] <Nicholas> Not to me. But I'm not the right person to ask about DU chains.

[11:07] <Nicholas> But I can say that no-one else has mentioned "Malformed DU chain" in some weeks, so, arguably, "no, it is not familiar"

[11:09] <dogbert17> just stumbled upon it, haven't seen any MoarVM related bugs for some time

[11:14] <dogbert17> I was running with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 and a small nursery plos the DU check ofc

[11:30] <dogbert17> it seems to be relatively easy to repro

[11:32] <dogbert17> perhaps Nine has some ideas about that might be going on
