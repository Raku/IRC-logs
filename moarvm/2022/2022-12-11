[00:53] <vrurg> Turns out I cannot change the settings of Rakudo repository. Can't set the primary branch to main.

[01:22] <jnthn> vrurg: I have privs to do that; should I?

[01:22] <vrurg> Yes.

[01:23] <vrurg> I'll make sure to correct all references to master.

[01:24] <jnthn> It is done. :)

[01:24] <vrurg> Yahoo!!! :D

[01:24] <jnthn> At least I did one useful thing for Raku this year now.

[01:24] <vrurg> Thanks

[01:24] <vrurg> !

[01:24] <jnthn> Welcome :)

[01:25] <vrurg> Can you also raise my privs on the repo? Just in case something goes wrong.

[01:25] <jnthn> I was about to point out that master had branch protection rules set and main does not but then I looked and...there actually isn't really anything enforced.

[01:26] <jnthn> vrurg: In theory I've just done that; please check.

[01:26] <vrurg> We were discussing it today at RSC. The plan was to add actions to master to have an error message if anybody commits to it.

[01:26] <vrurg> But what kind of protection to main would make sense for the main?

[01:27] <vrurg> Yep, see the settings now. Thanks!

[01:27] <jnthn> Ah, I misread. 

[01:27] <jnthn> So master had not allowing force pushes

[01:27] <jnthn> I think that should be done for main

[01:28] <jnthn> I see "Lock branch" is probably the appropraite setting for master now

[01:29] <jnthn> Let me know if you need anything more, but I figure now you have privs and know what to do :)

[01:29] <vrurg> JJ says it doesn't work for non-primary branches. But I haven't got there yet to check this out.

[01:29] <vrurg> Yeah, I think it's your time to have some rest. Haven't even expected to see you here today. :)

[12:00] <lizmat> I see a subtle difference in List creation now that we're on main in Rakudo

[12:01] *** reportable6 joined
[12:01] <lizmat> it looks like Lists can be created without a nqp::list in $!reified    wasn't there supposed to be an nqp::list in there always ?

[12:01] <lizmat> or am I confused in that respect?

[12:02] <lizmat> or is this just with code that is created using RakuAST ?

[12:46] *** Kaiepi joined
[15:13] <lizmat> re RakuAST: is it correct that you cannot create an AST at compile time, and then EVAL it at runtime?

[15:24] <lizmat> hmm... it seems to be scope related
