[14:48] <lizmat> from #raku-dev: [15:39:49]  <jdv>	can anyone in here help figure out this cro rakudo regression?

[15:22] *** MasterDuke left
[15:32] *** frost joined
[15:33] <jdv> the release is on hold for now.  the cro regression was tripped on when trying to create the moarvm gh release with the script that uses Cro failed so that's where things are at.

[17:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> jdv: Just released IO::Socket::Async::SSL 0.7.10, with a fix

[17:19] <jdv> will that be at cpan or fez?  looks like past releases are at cpan.

[17:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> cpan

[17:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> Certainly planning to switch to fez, but don't have time to get sorted with that now

[17:35] <lizmat> it's in REA now

[17:48] *** sena_kun left
[17:49] <jdv> i was just wondering when it'll be indexed.  thanks for teh fix!

[17:50] <jdv> i fetched it manually and it seems to work so i'll plod on.  hopefully it'll be available not long after the release.

[17:54] <lizmat> yeah, it can take up to 4 hours I believe

[17:55] <lizmat> one of the reasons to move away from it (although the time period is *not* CPAN's fault :-)
