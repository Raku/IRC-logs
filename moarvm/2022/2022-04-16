[18:00] <[Coke]> can we get a ruling on https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/435 ?

[19:43] <jnthnwrthngtn> [Coke]: PR seems sensible to me; I suspect nobody would intentionally write `<-[ ]>` as a long spelling of `.`

[19:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> We also forbid empty regexes more generally

[22:14] <[Coke]> ok. just looking for reasons to close tickets. :)
