[01:15] <MasterDuke> nine: is `use` supposed to completely work in rakuast? i had sort of thought so, but `RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ./rakudo-m -e 'use v6.e;'` does not complain about requiring the PREVIEW modifier (you get the SORRY! if you run that without the RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1)

[01:16] <MasterDuke> jnthn: same question ^^^

[22:03] <jnthn> MasterDuke: My recollection is that it only did modules, not any of the pragmas yet, although maybe `use lib` got done to help various spectests along. I think nine++ might have done some more in the Test.rakumod effort. Probably some of the pragmas want doing differntly (or can actually be written as modules) under RakuAST.
