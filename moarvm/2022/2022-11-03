[09:07] <nine> I stubbed some macros and have a local patch implementing "no precompilation" since that came in handy when investigating an issue.

[09:08] <nine> Stubbed here means, the parser parses them successfully but they do not have any effect yet.

[09:09] <nine> s/macros/pragmas/    .oO(curious typo)

[09:11] <lizmat> a freudian list almost  :-)

[09:11] <nine> Btw. that issues is that with Foo.rakumod containing `use Foo::Bar; use Foo::Baz; dd Foo.WHO.keys` I only get Bar when loading the precompiled Foo. But at BEGIN time and when adding a `no precompilation;` it gives me Bar and Baz.
