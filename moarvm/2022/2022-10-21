[13:14] <lizmat> jnthn nine what am I doing wrong getting STDIN reconnected?

[13:14] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/05fbd921cabe805c3e980aad14d08928

[13:15] <lizmat> and yes, I intend to put a functional result into a module  :-)

[13:56] *** epony joined
[14:00] <nine> lizmat: so you're closing STDIN, but then immediately opening it again and connecting it again to the tty. The result is the same as if you had just done nothing

[14:02] <nine> s/again to the tty/again to the input file/

[14:04] <nine> You want to dup $*IN, then close it, connect $*IN to the tty device, run vim, close $*IN and dup2 $*IN from where you saved the original descriptor

[14:06] <nine> Also there's no need for EVAL. https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/blob/master/lib/Inline/Perl5/Interpreter.pm6#L15

[16:51] <lizmat> thanks for the non-EVAL tip

[16:52] <lizmat> nine: fwiw, I'm not interested in the part when returning from vim

[16:54] *** epony left
[16:59] <lizmat> so essentially, you're saying: $*IN.close; $*IN = open '/dev/tty';

[17:00] <lizmat> actually: $*IN.close; $*IN = open '/dev/tty'; run 'vim'
