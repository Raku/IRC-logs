[07:39] <Kaipii> .tell jnthn, do you have any suggestions on how to benchmark semaphore ops reliably?

[07:39] <tellable6> Kaipii, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[07:42] <Kaipii> i want to say there's a modest improvement in the performance of semaphores atm, but that's going off how long it takes for t/spec/S17-lowlevel/semaphore.t to not race, so the range of output is a tad wide for my comfort
