[08:22] <nine> lizmat: ooooh I got a lead! And I think, this could really be it.

[08:24] <nine> Its' actually quite easy: it is complaining about gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp being the wrong version. This can only happen if that file is not included in the NQP source digest that is included in Rakudo's compiler id.

[08:24] <nine> And in fact gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp isn't included. At least not directly. That file is generated by concatenating a number of source files. So everything should be fine as long as all its sources are included in the source digest.

[08:25] *** bloatable6 joined
[08:25] <nine> However, a `grep From gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp` reveals, that among a number of .nqp files from src/ (which are all included in the digest), there's also gen/moar/stage2/nqp-config.nqp

[08:26] <nine> And nqp-config.nqp is _not_ included in the digest. It can't be, because that's where tools/build/gen-version.pl writes the digest to.

[08:27] <nine> Now there are few reasons for why that file would change. Obviously a change in the src/ files would yield a different digest, thus changing nqp-config.nqp. But since the digest already changed, we're still safe.

[08:27] <nine> But there's also $config<version>         := '2022.02-11-g0fd161cdc';

[08:28] <nine> So any version change (like the commit that bumps MoarVM) will change this file and only this file. In turn this will change gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp, thus NQPHLL.moarvm which will ultimately lead to the dependency error.

[08:53] <nine> The "No such private method 'SET-SELF' on Map" must be from spesh of dist-from-ls, a small helper method with just 191 BBs and a mere 460 registers.
