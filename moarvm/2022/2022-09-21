[00:41] <MasterDuke> i'm trying to remember what i was working on last, and drawing a bit of a blank. guess i should try to finish up the gmp branch

[00:43] <MasterDuke> but iirc, assuming i find the last remaining windows bug, there's still the problem that it aborts if exponentiation would result in too big of a number. and iirc again, i couldn't find a way to sufficiently catch the abort. may have to carry around some patch to change its behavior

[00:50] <MasterDuke> i'm also tempted to see if i can learn enough to materially help out on the rakuast branch, but that's a different can of worms

[00:51] <japhb> MasterDuke: nine had said that he had specifically *avoided* stealing the low-hanging fruit on the RakuAST branch so as to leave room for people to ramp up.

[00:52] <japhb> Plus there's currently a discussion on whether it's valuable to release a new Raku language version without RakuAST substantially in place, and the best answer to that I believe is to make it a moot point by finishing RakuAST.  (Or as I said, substantially so.)

[00:52] <japhb> So ... yes please?  :-)

[00:53] <MasterDuke> hah

[00:54] <MasterDuke> hm. just did a `git fetch upstream` and see updates to both rakuast and rakuast_wip branches

[01:52] <MasterDuke> it did install just fine on the rakuast branch
