[16:46] <Kaiepi> i tried using uv_timer_t to sleep(0) instead of yielding, but apparently that api forks?

[16:46] <Kaiepi> i did manage to get sleep(0e0)/nanosleep(0) to work given recent changes, but it's rather slow

[17:41] <jnthn> Kaiepi: What's the original goal here? Semaphore (along with similar classes) were really intended to expose the primitive kernel-supported locks/sempahores; if you want something a bit different and are willing to depend on yield and atomics, there's no reason to put it in MoarVM, because those are all available in Raku.

[17:41] <tellable6> 2022-07-22T07:39:31Z #moarvm <Kaipii> jnthn, do you have any suggestions on how to benchmark semaphore ops reliably?

[17:42] <jnthn> No yield/sleep/whatever is going to be as effective for longer waits as something where the OS schedule is aware of it.

[17:42] <jnthn> *scheduler

[17:54] <Kaiepi> jnthn, to get an implementation of Semaphore with some equivalent to sem_getvalue

[17:55] <Kaiepi> so we can get a serializable, thread-safe counter for the MOP

[17:56] <Kaiepi> (or at least a more efficient one)

[19:17] <jnthn> Counter? Is an atomic integer not enough?

[19:18] <Kaiepi> an atomic integer requires a container

[19:18] <jnthn> Not quite, just a reference to an integer lexical/attribute/array elemnt

[19:19] <jnthn> And if the concern is performance, one can create that reference once and use it many times

[19:20] <jnthn> Ah, and if it's for the MOP, and nobody got around to it yet, there might be a little setup work to do to make those available in NQP

[19:22] <jnthn> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/a7e9b1938bfdf9a2e932ca012a97699df03d4a57/src/Perl6/bootstrap.c/BOOTSTRAP.nqp#L1899 is a place to look at how the setup is done if wanting to do it for NQP
