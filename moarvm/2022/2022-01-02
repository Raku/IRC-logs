[14:24] <nine> I didn't like my first attempt (using temp roots) of a fix and it turned out, it was utterly broken. Second attempt (storing materialized objects in a VMArray) worked but was a bit heavier on performance. This one I like best. Only downside is that it will break on frames with 65535 registers.
[15:47] <timo> as long as we don't store dates in the number-of-registers slot, we should be safe
[16:05] <lizmat> that sounds like an Excel lent idea :-)

[20:20] <Nicholas> I assume that this was because it looks like it pinged out within 60 seconds of my remark, and the ping timeout was reported as 240 seconds, so I'm inferring it was lagged by >240 seconds, so hadn't recieved it
[20:20] <lizmat> yeah, I guess
