[12:21] <nine> I guess the next step should be to get those new ops merged so they can be part of the first rebootstrap

[12:22] <nine> But for now: new year's cycling :)

[12:23] * lizmat will do so as well soonish

[17:54] <nine> I know what's going on in #1628. When materializing as part of deopt, we are putting objects into an array of which the GC doesn't know anything about. That's how those pointers get outdated. I have a fix which I'm testing now (will take a while) but I don't particularily like it.
