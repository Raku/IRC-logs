[10:57] <MasterDuke> jnthnwrthngtn: if you're up for an interesting riddle, any idea why changing https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Str.pm6#L1812 from `flat matches` to `matches.list` results in https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e945bafe0295ac39e68ca65455dc5e48 ?

[12:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: Maybe there really is something that needs flattening? What is `matches`? Put in a `dd $m` and compare before/after?

[13:07] *** ggoebel left
[13:47] <MasterDuke> hm. the last `matches` before the exception is `Match.new(:orig("lib::CompUnit::Repository::Staging.rakumod"), :from(34), :pos(42))`, but yeah, guess i should see what `$m` is

[14:42] <MasterDuke> weird, everything i see printed is the same

[14:46] <MasterDuke> nope, spoke too soon

[15:00] <MasterDuke> it's actually sort of the opposite of what i'd expect. .list has a lot more output than flat

[15:24] <MasterDuke> ah, when matches ~~ Capture then .flat != .list
