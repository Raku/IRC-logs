[17:02] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: does RakuAST do module loading yet?

[17:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Loading, yes, but not precomp (so you need to have had them precompiled using non-RakuAST)

[17:07] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: wrong! :D

[17:08] <nine> https://gist.github.com/niner/0422e5ca8a00c70582e88273717f787b gets us through repository setup, precompilation and loading

[17:09] <nine> Of course Test.rakumod would be a bit of a steep hill to climb next. Especially since we already stumble over the unit module declaration

[17:09] <Nicholas> I see the date on that ... :-)

[17:10] <Nicholas> but I assume that this is a double bluff

[17:10] <nine> My first impression is: RakuAST is really nice to create high level Raku ASTs, but makes it somewhat hard to create low level code like those proxy readers

[17:12] <nine> And why don't we need to call the compunit here in the old QAST implementation?? https://gist.github.com/niner/0422e5ca8a00c70582e88273717f787b#file-first_rakuast_steps-diff-L316

[17:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: I'm not immediately sure if the proxy reader should be done via RakuAST :)

[17:12] <nine> Took me days to figure out that all it needed was that () at the end to get the actual pointy block that we wanted, not the comp unit's mainline

[17:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh. Hmm. :)

[17:13] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: I suspected that, but it's what came up (the missing optimize stage) and I figured it's at least a lesson in how RakuAST works

[17:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine++ # getting into RakuAST now too :)

[17:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> Was the hllize introduction purely for the sake of the proxy reader thing?

[17:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> (I'm not really sure that concept should be part of the RakuAST API, is all...)

[17:16] <nine> Yes

[17:25] <nine> I assume I'll write quite a bit of code that will not end up anywhere because it violates the design. But then, I'm a total beginner in this area and most of the work is currently just learning.

[17:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> :)

[17:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Feel free to ask anything about the design

[17:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm hopeful of having more time for working on this in the months ahead compared to the last however many

[17:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> For now, though, dinner won't cook itself...bbl

[21:04] <nine> Just pushed my first commits to rakuast :)

[21:04] <nine> With that, I think I've earned myself some Doom before going to bed ;)

[21:09] <MasterDuke> i was just reading about the new raytracing mod for doom. i finished hl: blue shift a couple days ago, was going to start hl2 in a couple min. getting distracted by this project euler problem though...
