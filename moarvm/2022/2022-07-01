[23:47] <timo> my recommendation for the day: when you copy your root filesystem, perhaps make extra sure selinux attributes are kept, or at the very least turn enforcing off at boot if you'd like to be able to log in

[23:54] <japhb> My recommendation: Never copy your root filesystem, aside from maybe system backups.  :-)
