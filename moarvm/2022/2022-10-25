[11:26] <nine> jnthn: you ok with taking an updated rakuast branch, renaming it to "main" and using this as the new - well - main branch? I figure it should be safe, as the new compiler frontend is strictly opt-in. I don't see anyone cleaning up the branch's history before a merge and developing on main would lower the entry barrier and help prevent the branch from bitrotting.

[14:01] <MasterDuke> i just realized the downside to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1723 is that the libuv functions are not implemented on windows

[14:01] <tellable6> 2022-10-24T00:39:46Z #moarvm <japhb> MasterDuke:  Yeah, sorry, thumbs-up from me.

[14:02] <MasterDuke> but i feel we must have some other subs/methods in raku that are OS-specific?

[14:05] <jnthn> nine: What if people then depend on RakuAST stuff when there's no doubt things that will have to be changed?

[14:13] <nine> jnthn: Well, truth is, I just don't know what else to do. In the 3 months I was stuck on that stupid problem, there was 0 progress on RakuAST and even worse: it actually fell further behind, as there were changes to the old frontend. I wonder if that isn't a greater danger than early adopters having to...well adopt some more.

[14:39] <MasterDuke> OT, but would this (https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#frozen-imports-static-code-objects) be something we could steal?

[14:42] <MasterDuke> or would that require coupling moarvm and rakudo too closely?

[15:35] <japhb> jnthn: Since the new compiler frontend would still be strictly opt-in, I don't think people could *accidentally* rely on RakuAST ... but I do understand the concern about people who might develop very large amounts of RakuAST code, hoping to push it to zef as soon as RakuAST becomes default, and forcing them to rework that boulder a few times.

[20:49] <japhb> Forgot to write this in channel -- spoke to jnthn today about RakuAST as main: he's fine with it as long as 1) the new compiler frontend remains opt-in-only, 2) access to RakuAST classes requires a 'use experimental', 3) people who are chomping at the bit to get started converting stuff to RakuAST are warned explicitly, again, that there *will* be API changes before it is "done", and early adopters will be 

[20:49] <japhb> left holding the pieces if their forward-looking code breaks.
