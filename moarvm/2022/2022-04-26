[08:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ahoj!

[09:00] <Nicholas> jnthnwrthngtn: a friend I was with at the weekend is learning Czech using duolingo. duolingo offered the following phrase (in English and Czech): I drink beer because I am thirsty

[09:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Me too duo, me too... :)

[09:05] <Nicholas> that was what we both thought.

[09:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> The microbrewery I go to now and then, which usually makes reliably nice beers, recently made a mint APA. I think it's the first beer I've had in a while that I questioned not finishing.

[09:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> uh, s/questioned/considered/

[09:24] <MasterDuke> huh. that sounds like an IPA i might actually like. you don't like mint?

[09:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> I do like mint. I do like IPA/APA.

[09:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Somehow their combination didn't work for me. Or at least, this combination didn't.

[12:18] <nine> Lot of people like fish. Even more people like chocolate. For some reason, Zotter's fish chocolate (yes, for real) didn't take off though.

[12:28] <Nicholas> Herr Zotter has some crazy ideas. There's a graveyard for them roughly here: https://www.google.com/maps/@46.9916884,15.9094969,44m/data=!3m1!1e3

[12:28] <Nicholas> (the factory tour is fun)

[12:28] <MasterDuke> huh, never heard of them

[20:52] <drakonis> while you're still here, i wanted to ask about multiple dispatch and constraints being used together in a similar manner to pattern matching

[20:53] <drakonis> guards

[20:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> OK, what's the question?

[20:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> I mean, multiple dispatch constraints and signature unpacking can do stuff like pattern matching/destructuring.

[20:59] <drakonis> with enough patience, it should be possible to combine those together into a keyword for pattern matching, yeah?

[21:00] <drakonis> seems like it'd require wading in rakudo's guts for this

[21:01] *** Geth left
[21:01] *** Geth joined
[21:01] <drakonis> ie: pattern matching being syntax sugar for the combination of multiple dispatch constraints and signature packing

[21:02] <drakonis> or is that still going to require rakuast to even do that?

[21:05] <drakonis> syntax sugar is another kind of codegen isnt it

[21:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think at some point it was speculated what `when` with a signatured (pointy) block would accept if the signature matched, although that never got implemented thus far. But if you want to do syntax sugar stuff, yes, that's probably a slang + rakuast job, and it's not really at a point where one can easily do that yet

[21:08] <drakonis> that does dampen my excitement at the moment

[21:11] <drakonis> but it should be worth the wait

[21:19] <MasterDuke> if people are around and up for some thinking, any thoughts on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1685 or https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1645 ?

[21:20] <MasterDuke> or https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1470
