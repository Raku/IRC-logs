[09:00] <Nicholas> jnthnwrthngtn: a friend I was with at the weekend is learning Czech using duolingo. duolingo offered the following phrase (in English and Czech): I drink beer because I am thirsty
[09:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> Me too duo, me too... :)
[09:05] <Nicholas> that was what we both thought.
[09:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> The microbrewery I go to now and then, which usually makes reliably nice beers, recently made a mint APA. I think it's the first beer I've had in a while that I questioned not finishing.
[09:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> uh, s/questioned/considered/
[09:24] <MasterDuke> huh. that sounds like an IPA i might actually like. you don't like mint?
[09:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> I do like mint. I do like IPA/APA.
[09:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Somehow their combination didn't work for me. Or at least, this combination didn't.

[19:55] <drakonis> is there any documentation for experimental rakuast and slang usage?
[19:57] <drakonis> highly possible this is the wrong channel
[20:00] *** sena_kun left
[20:01] <drakonis> also how to write a new trait to modify moarvm behavior when dealing with recursive functions
[20:02] <drakonis> as it is the kind of change that needs to go on the vm
[20:02] *** sena_kun joined
[20:03] <[Coke]> in the rakuast branch, there's src/Raku/ast/README.md

[20:26] <jnthnwrthngtn> drakonis: If it's about supporting tailcalls, I guess places to start reading in MoarVM are https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/core/callstack.h for stack layout and around https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/4e2eab05637b569053152d55e8fa17a9a659760e/src/core/frame.c#L455 for where stack frame creation is driven.
[20:26] <drakonis> i see
[20:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> I suspect it'd then want to be plumbed in NQP somewhere. How exactly depends on the semantics you're shooting for.
[20:29] <drakonis> hmm, looks like there's multiple ways to achieve it
[20:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> Although most probably you'd need a new boot-tailcall dispatch terminal
[20:29] <drakonis> one where you can explicitly transform a procedure call into a tail call
[20:29] <drakonis> https://ocaml.org/releases/4.14/htmlman/tail_mod_cons.html as seen here
[20:30] <drakonis> as opposed to just the returning procedure call
[20:30] <drakonis> the semantics seem similar to what i'd want to do
[20:31] <drakonis> although it is still experimental
[20:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> I kinda wonder if it'd be possible, when AST is availble in traits, to avoid doing any VM stuff and just rewrite it as a loop in RakuAST
[20:32] <drakonis> i'm not sure whether doing that would always map correctly to recursive functions that aren't really loops
[20:32] <drakonis> ie: traveling a tree structure
[20:33] <drakonis> traversing or generating trees
[20:35] <drakonis> or dealing with anything deep
[20:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, I'm not sure off hand
[20:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Also https://jnthn.net/papers/2021-trc-dispatch.pdf is maybe of interest in parts (it explains how calls work)
[20:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Among the many semantics to figure out are if a recursive call in a multi candidate should call the proto 
[20:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> Which brings up the issue I've mentioned before, that what MoarVM thinks of as a stack frame may not be the thing you think of as a function
[20:43] <jnthnwrthngtn> So doing this well might actually mean pealing off multiple VM level frames. I dunno where the arguments of the recursive call should be stored, although one would need to ensure the GC can find them
[20:47] <drakonis> also, loops can be implemented with recursion
[20:49] <drakonis> but modelling a traversal algorithm for non contiguous data structures sucks

[20:52] <drakonis> while you're still here, i wanted to ask about multiple dispatch and constraints being used together in a similar manner to pattern matching
[20:53] <drakonis> guards

[20:56] *** Geth left
[20:56] *** Geth joined
[20:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> OK, what's the question?
[20:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> I mean, multiple dispatch constraints and signature unpacking can do stuff like pattern matching/destructuring.
[20:59] <drakonis> with enough patience, it should be possible to combine those together into a keyword for pattern matching, yeah?
[21:00] <drakonis> seems like it'd require wading in rakudo's guts for this
[21:01] *** Geth left
[21:01] <drakonis> alternatively, the real question is whether code can be reduced to syntatic sugar
[21:01] *** Geth joined
[21:01] <drakonis> ie: pattern matching being syntax sugar for the combination of multiple dispatch constraints and signature packing
[21:02] <drakonis> or is that still going to require rakuast to even do that?
[21:05] <drakonis> syntax sugar is another kind of codegen isnt it
[21:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think at some point it was speculated what `when` with a signatured (pointy) block would accept if the signature matched, although that never got implemented thus far. But if you want to do syntax sugar stuff, yes, that's probably a slang + rakuast job, and it's not really at a point where one can easily do that yet
[21:08] <drakonis> that does dampen my excitement at the moment
[21:11] <drakonis> but it should be worth the wait
[21:19] <MasterDuke> if people are around and up for some thinking, any thoughts on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1685 or https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1645 ?
