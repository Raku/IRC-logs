[20:08] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: I'm not sure the !eval test in t/12-rakuast/var.t makes sense as it is. It's still using EVAL to run the code, but EVAL uses a RakuAST::Resolver::EVAL which will e.g. find the outer package.

[20:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: I think the point was that it declares a fresh GLOBALish and the $y lives in that, rather than taking the surrounding package

[20:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> I don't see how it can find the outer package; the `outer` of a :!eval is meant to be the setting

[20:30] <jnthnwrthngtn> So it can't find the $?PACKAGE of module M lexically either

[20:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or at least, that's how it's meant to be :)

[20:34] <nine> jnthnwrthngtn: but the RakuAST::Resolver::EVAL doesn't know that in this case it isn't supposed to know about the outer package and finds it anyway: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/rakuast/src/Raku/ast/resolver.rakumod#L438

[20:38] <nine> Or arguably it's EVAL itself which still passes the caller's context in this case: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/rakuast/src/core.c/ForeignCode.pm6#L87

[20:52] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, it's possible some things are on the resolver hook that should be hanging off CompUnit instead.

[20:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> (RakuAST::Resolver::EVAL pre-dates what's been figured out of RakuAST::CompUnit

[20:54] <jnthnwrthngtn> Probably the EVAL resolver is also mis-named, since it's really the "we're starting out with an AST" resolver

[20:54] <jnthnwrthngtn> An EVAL with source code would be using the Compiler resolver
