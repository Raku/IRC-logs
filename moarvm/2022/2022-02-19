[13:57] <MasterDuke> `gcc.exe: error: 3rdparty\gmp\libgmp.a: No such file or directory`, well, that's actually progress on the mingw build

[14:27] <MasterDuke> interesting. mingw uses mvsc instead of gcc to build gmp, so it creates a dll

[14:31] <MasterDuke> i guess because it finds 3rdparty/gmp/SMP/libgmp.vcxproj

[14:34] <MasterDuke> i'll try deleting that directory for mingw...

[19:26] <MasterDuke> i think it's no exaggeration to say that i've spent more time on getting gmp to build on windows (msvc + mingw) than on all the rest of the related work combined

[19:37] <japhb> :-( :-(
