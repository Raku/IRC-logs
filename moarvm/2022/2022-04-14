[09:37] <Nicholas> \o

[10:36] <nine> Well I took a few hours off this morning to finish my introductionary flights on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospool_WT9_Dynamic

[10:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> If the weather is as nice there as it is here, I guess it was a nice day to be flying :)

[10:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> In less exciting news, 1 more fully passing spectest brings us to 382 of them.

[10:46] <MasterDuke> nine: have you flown (in) any electric aircraft?

[10:58] <nine> MasterDuke: not yet, but my new glider club has two Silent 2 Electro and I'm looking forward to flying them :)

[11:00] <MasterDuke> nice. i know very little about flying, but i was curious if they have different performance/operating characteristics like an electric car does (e.g., all the torque available right away so generally better acceleration, no engine noise)

[11:13] <MasterDuke> i just realized i don't know what happens to the things MVMROOTed if an exception is thrown. do exceptions pop them somehow? or it just doesn't matter?

[11:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, they're popped

[11:18] <MasterDuke> cool

[11:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> grep for MVM_gc_root_temp_pop_all

[11:21] <MasterDuke> ah, in MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free_va

[11:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> Turns out nine++'s fix for the proxy reader factory in RakuAST was the right idea but a bit off. Fixing it up fully gets us to 392 fully passing

[11:31] <MasterDuke> i'm just running vrurgs libxml segfault golf in rr, and i see where body->cstruct gets set to 0x100000000

[11:32] <MasterDuke> it's here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/reprs/CStruct.c#L519

[11:33] <MasterDuke> because cobj is `(void *) 0x100000000`

[11:43] <MasterDuke> but this looks like the sort of thing nine++ fixes very quickly, and nothing obvious is jumping out at me, so i'll probably leave off here

[16:07] <nine> MasterDuke: biggest advantage of electric engines is their reliability. I fly gliders which may have engines for starting or getting home even when thermals won't carry you anymore. The planes' manuals often tell you straight out that those engines are made to be light and cheap and that you may not rely on them.

[16:08] <nine> Electric engines really just don't break. They are easier to use as well (often just a single dial to twist) which makes it safer as the pilot can't forget a crucial step like opening the fuel valve.

[16:10] <nine> And last but not least they turn on instantly. Those 2 stroke engines in e.g. http://logfnet.alfahosting.org/joomla/images/stories/segel/gross/duodiscus_4.jpg often don't have starters, so you have to use wind milling to turn them on which costs you about 150m of altitude

[18:22] <MasterDuke> interesting. i haven't even driven an electric car yet, but am considering one when i need to get a car in a couple months
