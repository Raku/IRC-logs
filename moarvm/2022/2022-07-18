[10:15] <lizmat> nine: while working on the Weekly, I realized that the rakuast branch isn't clean at the moment (quite a few merge conflicts)

[10:15] <lizmat> is that correct ?

[10:16] <lizmat> or should I just drop the local branch and check it out again ?

[10:56] <jnthn> lizmat: Probably the latter, sounds like you may have pulled after it had been rebased or something like this.

[11:07] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/07/18/2022-29-hot/

[11:27] <timo> do we have something like hllboxtype_u? because right now we're generating a hllboxtype_i + box_u

[11:32] <timo> add_uint32 gets a uint via a uint callsite flag, then boxes it like this, then calls write_uint32_at which can't be inlined because it has param_rp_o, which is there because arg spesh aborted because BOOTInt doesn't box an uint

[11:37] <timo> the hll config definitely does have a slot for a uint box type

[11:38] <nine> Even if we had an hllboxtype_u, we couldn't use it for boxing, because the unsigned int box type is UInt which is a subset type which you can't create.

[11:45] <timo> i quickly whipped that up and yeah, core setting runs into a segfault
