[12:55] <lizmat> and there's another day almost past   :-)

[12:55] <lizmat> target has a :noinline instruction - ins: param_rp_o

[12:55] <lizmat> is that an easily fixable inline issue ?

[13:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> It's more an argument optimization issue; the argument handling optimization usually rewrites all of those

[13:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> So by the time we reach inlining, they ideally are gone (since there's not a good way to inline them)

[13:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> So the question is "why weren't they written to unchecked parameter instructions"

[13:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Time for me to POETS :) o/

[13:51] <lizmat> full disclosure:

[13:51] <lizmat>  2x write_uint32_at BB(7, 68 bytes) -> add_uint32 BB(330):

[13:51] <lizmat>       target has a :noinline instruction - ins: param_rp_o

[13:51] <lizmat>  3x write_uint16_at BB(9, 68 bytes) -> add_uint16 BB(331):

[13:51] <lizmat>       target has a :noinline instruction - ins: param_rp_o

[18:37] <MasterDuke> lizmat: what's the raku code where you see that?

[18:50] <lizmat> it's from running test-t with -MSIL

[18:50] <lizmat> raku -MSIL test-t.pl <hello.csv

[18:51] <Nicholas> japhb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POETS_day

[18:52] <Nicholas> "It is tradition to begin the POETS day at 3:30 p.m" is definately [Citation needed]

[18:53] <MasterDuke> huh, i don't see that

[19:02] <MasterDuke> ok, i do on master (i was on my branch that converts a lot of `find_symbol([...], :setting-only)` to `find_symbol_in_setting([...])`)

[19:04] <japhb> Nicholas: Ah, got it!

[19:33] <MasterDuke> hm. none of the obvious things that would cause param_rp_o to not get optimized in src/spesh/args.c seem to be the cause

[20:33] <MasterDuke> i seem to get different results with -MSIL and just running with MVM_SPESH_LOG=1. there's no mention of param_rp_o or write_uint* when i do MVM_SPESH_LOG=1
