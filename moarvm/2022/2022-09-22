[01:38] <MasterDuke> patrickb: it would actually take a while to really bit rot. the math code doesn't get changed frequently, so the branch rebases pretty easily up to HEAD of master. even if i don't ever get it merged (though i do intend to), someone else could probably finish it up without much difficulty

[01:43] <MasterDuke> nine: re rakuast, is the best course still just trying to run tests and picking one that doesn't compile yet to work on?
