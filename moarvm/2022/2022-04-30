[09:24] <nine> Finally making some real progress on multi support in RakuAST :) Introduced a RakuAST::VarDeclaration::Implicit::Block class for adding a generated lexical declaration of the proto's AST (and using an ::Implicit::Constant declaration for the compile time value)

[09:24] <nine> Most simple example with a generated proto works. Actual multi displatch yet to come: Ambiguous call to 'substtest(Str)'; these signatures all match: (;; Str $d) (;; Int $i)

[11:10] <lizmat> OOC: what makes the NEXT phaser different from e.g. LAST phaser: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/bootstrap.c/BOOTSTRAP.nqp#L2347

[11:10] <lizmat> in that it doesn't need an nqp::captureinnerlex like LAST / QUIT / CLOSE do ?

[12:55] <lizmat> m: use nqp; my $h := nqp::hash("a",42); nqp::deletekey($h,"a")

[12:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[12:55] <lizmat> hmmm

[12:58] <lizmat> m: use nqp; my $h := nqp::hash("a",42); say nqp::deletekey($h,"a")

[12:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤0 flag for arg 1 with kind 0␤»

[13:23] <Voldenet> > deletekey(%hash, str $key –> %hash)

[13:23] <Voldenet> just thinking out loud - wouldn't it be more useful to get bool out of that

[14:09] <lizmat> or the actual value  :-)

[14:15] *** frost left
[14:36] <Nicholas> need to go AFK again, but IIRC I made a MoarVM branch with an op that did "delete returning hash value" and hoped someone else could take it further to make a rakudo change to use it to return the value (in one op, rather than two currently)

[14:37] <lizmat> I'll gladly do the Rakudo part for that  :-)
