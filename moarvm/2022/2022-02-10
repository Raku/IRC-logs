[19:40] * [Coke] wonders if anyone here has a CMS they have to deal with as part of their $DAYJOB
[19:46] <MasterDuke> just force pushed the (non-working) rebase for https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1561 if anybody feels like taking a look
[19:47] <MasterDuke> uh, `##[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request`
[19:53] <[Coke]> (CMS) oops, ww.
