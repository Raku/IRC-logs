[07:02] <nine> timo: it shouldn't be, as RakuAST is mostly an addition and barely touches any existing code.

[07:03] <nine> But then, there seems to be an entirely new category of conflicts: CONFLICT (rename/rename): src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationUnit.pm6 renamed to temp in HEAD and to src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationId.pm6 in 67ec879a1 (Split history src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationUnit.pm6 to src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationId.pm6 - rename file to target-name).

[07:57] <nine> Ah, my master branch was out of date. ENOCOFFEE

[07:57] <nine> There were a few conflicts, but it wasn't that bad.

[08:14] <nine> Except that there seem to have been incompatible changes to setting/bootstrap loading: ctxlexpad needs an MVMContext, got P6opaque (NQPMu) instead at gen/moar/ModuleLoader.nqp:90  (/home/nine/rakudo/blib/Perl6/ModuleLoader.moarvm:load_bootstrap)

[08:24] <nine> lizmat: what do I need to change?

[08:25] <lizmat> hmmm... have a diff?

[08:29] <lizmat> maybe it needs a decont ?

[08:29] <nine> I've already found that transform_setting_name is gone, but that seems to have been just a wrapper for previous_setting_name, so I replaced it with that. That got me to the error message above

[08:30] <nine> What other changes did you make to setting loading?

[08:30] <lizmat> it's mostly 2cadc4d869 I think

[08:30] <nine> If it was about decont, that error would have said got P6opaque (Scalar)

[08:30] <lizmat> ack  ok

[08:31] *** linkable6 left
[08:31] <lizmat> so somehow an NQPMu got into the hash ?

[08:31] *** linkable6 joined
[08:32] <nine> Into $*MAIN_CTX

[08:32] <lizmat>         my $*MAIN_CTX;

[08:32] <lizmat>         nqp::loadbytecode($file);

[08:32] <lizmat>         %modules_loaded{$file} := my $module_ctx := $*MAIN_CTX;

[08:33] <lizmat> then nqp::loadbytecode either failed or did not set $*MAIN_CTX ?

[08:40] <nine> Using src/Perl6/ModuleLoader.nqp from the rakuast branch fixes the issue

[08:41] <lizmat> ok, I can work with that

[08:46] <nine> lizmat: I pushed my rakuast_wip branch including that revert. With that you should be able to reproduce the issue by switching between HEAD and HEAD^

[08:56] <lizmat> nine: since  2cadc4d869 was an optimization, I think I'll wait for RakuAST to land, and then see what has become of it, and then apply the same optimization again

[08:56] <lizmat> if need be

[08:56] <lizmat> so, carry on  :-)

[09:52] <nine> After the rebase it's several spec tests working again. But also one new failure: t/spec/S24-testing/11-plan-skip-all-subtests.t fails with Invalid Test::X::SubtestsSkipped.BUILDALL plan: 1000
