[12:02] <lizmat> re question on SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72654494/how-can-i-get-unbuffered-input-to-a-program/72657133?noredirect=1#comment128344229_72657133

[12:02] <lizmat> and this answer: https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/358#issuecomment-4685453

[12:03] <lizmat> would it make sense to add a dispatch / nqp op to make the tty unbuffered ?

[12:06] <jnthn> lizmat: Seems like a reasonable suggestion, yes, if libuv already did the work to abstract it over platforms :)

[13:04] <japhb> I know how on non-Windows -- and like so many things, it's more complicated than just a simple call to unbuffer -- but not on Windows.  Hopefully, as jnthn said, libuv has the fix.
