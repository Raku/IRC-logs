[09:26] <lizmat> Looks I found an issue with spesh

[09:26] <lizmat> unfortunately, I have not been able to golf it yet

[09:28] <lizmat> basically, a native int becomes a Scalar somehow in $i++

[09:28] <lizmat> This type cannot unbox to a native integer: P6opaque, Scalar

[09:28] <lizmat> happens after anytime between 165 and 181 times

[09:29] <timo> does spesh_nodelay make it happen faster? can you reproduce it on earlier releases?

[09:31] <lizmat> with NODELAY it happens after about 40 iterations

[09:31] <lizmat> or 67 or 69 or 45    definitely lower

[09:32] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/App-Rak/blob/main/lib/App/Rak.rakumod#L875 to be precise

[09:33] <timo> sayer! \m/

[09:33] <lizmat> by default, that's just &say

[09:34] <timo> say, sayer, sayest

[09:34] <timo> bbl

[10:16] <lizmat> I got it reproducible to:

[10:16] <lizmat> zef install App::Rak

[10:16] <lizmat> move to a rakudo source directory

[10:16] <lizmat> rak '# vim' src

[10:16] <lizmat> This type cannot unbox to a native integer: P6opaque, Scalar

[10:16] <lizmat>   in sub want-lines at /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/sources/3EA16C798869CE562E21EE469418C66AC506167E (App::Rak) line 875

[10:20] <lizmat> FWIW, this happens on both Intel as M1
