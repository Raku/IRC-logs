[09:54] <nine> jnthn: is there a plan for how to get file name and line number information into files compiled from RakuAST? I kinda miss that when debugging things...

[14:06] <jnthn> nine: Yes, my idea was that every RakuAST node carries a signed integer that is the char offset of the element in "normal" mode, but if there is more detailed match info to attach (for example, if we want to provide a parse mode that gives the exact extends of everything) negative integers are used, and negated and used as a lookup in a table, perhaps attached to the comp unit.

[14:07] <jnthn> The same table approach would also be used for macros, where the AST instantiated from the quasi might correspond to source from another file

[14:07] <jnthn> nine: For passing it on to the QAST, I think it'd work a lot like today: resolve the char offset into a line number and attach it for each statement

[14:08] <jnthn> The existing char offset to line conversinon thing somewhere in NQP can presumably be reused, along with its caching

[14:10] <jnthn> Ah, and also: I figured the char offset would be attached in the `attach` method: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/46d8c1ac380bf0eae9b4255b1c27f3289c49e64e/src/Raku/Actions.nqp#L22

[14:25] <nine> And that would call a new set-char-offset (or the like) method on RakuAST::Node, so we don't have to adjust all the constructors?

[15:04] <jnthn> Yes, something like that

[16:15] <nine> jnthn: don't remember if I've asked this before, but have you actually ever looked at my rakuast commits?
