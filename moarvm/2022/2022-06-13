[21:54] <MasterDuke> nice. i wonder, is there some point (i.e., number of features implemented) at which the number of passing spectest files increases dramatically? or is it going to continue to be a sort of (apparently) linear increase?

[22:01] <japhb> MasterDuke: I think nine++ might have already worked through that phase where there's a burst of additional passes with just a few features fixed.  I get the distinct feeling he's back in slow land.  (But of course, he may be about to open up a new burst of passes; I suspect that there's an alternating pattern of getting a bunch of small blockers out of the way and then suddenly getting some big wins.)
