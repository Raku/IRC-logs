[22:21] <[Coke]> Spouse refilled the feeders out front, it's almost 18:30 and the birds are still going strong.

[22:22] <japhb> I rather like birds in general (we have several feeders), but that one that likes to make neighborhood-piercing noises at 4 AM from the tree out front ... THAT one has my ire.

[22:24] <japhb> Worse, it comes back to that same tree every year, and goes on for weeks on end.
