[16:02] <MasterDuke> anyone here have any experience with mingw? i'm not making much progress

[16:31] <nine> Sorry. I've avoided Windows whenever possible

[16:42] <MasterDuke> heh. same

[16:42] <lizmat> Windows?  not seen that in the past 20 years  :-)

[16:43] <lizmat> ok, 19 then  :-)

[16:44] <MasterDuke> my current not-so-serious plan is just to add a commit to the gmp PR that removes mingw from CI...

[16:44] <MasterDuke> then it'll be green across the board

[16:46] <MasterDuke> a slightly more serious one is to instead have the mingw job install a gmp package and build with --has-gmp

[17:06] <nine> Sounds like a solution then

[17:06] <MasterDuke> it's sort of cheating, it's being built in all the other environments

[20:25] <japhb> It's not cheating, it's *technique*

[20:44] <MasterDuke> changing topics, do i remember correctly that during the fosdem rsc q&a there was some mention of a possible rakudo devs conference?

[20:53] <MasterDuke> `Can't compile simple gcc probe, so something is badly wrong at build/probe.pm line 208.` huh?

[21:20] *** linkable6 joined
[21:30] <nine> MasterDuke: there was

[22:12] <MasterDuke> but no details?

[22:31] <nine> I think currently it's just an idea

[22:31] <MasterDuke> ah

[22:42] <MasterDuke> this is weird. moarvm builds fine under my local mingw with `--has-gmp`, so why doesn't it in CI? that error means the probe can't find it (though it would be nice if the error mentioned the name of the thing it was trying)

[23:07] <MasterDuke> even my cheating doesn't work
