[04:50] <MasterDuke> is there any way to know that an MVMString won't have synthetics? if the storage type is MVM_STRING_GRAPHEME_ASCII could we be sure?

[20:28] <lizmat> jnthn nine rakuast question: suppose I have an $ast representing some code, and I would like to use that code more than once, can I use the same RakuAST::xxx object, or do I need to re-make it / clone it ?

[20:29] <lizmat> specific case:  $foo ?? $foo !! ""

[20:29] *** sena_kun joined
[20:29] <lizmat> and $foo would be something like @args.AT-POS(0)
