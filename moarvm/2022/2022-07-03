[11:18] <nine> Now 422 passing without doing a non-RakuAST spectest run first! Narrowing the gap to just 81

[11:18] <timo> \o/

[14:06] <nine> 2 more fixes and we are at 506/487 respectively, closing the gap to just 19! That's now more spec test files passing without requiring precompilation than we did pass with precompilation just 3 days ago :)

[16:20] <nine> jnthn: there's no more need to run a normal spectest before doing a RakuAST count :)

[16:55] <japhb> nine++

[17:07] <timo> you mean the gap is now at 0?

[17:09] <nine> timo: yes

[17:09] <timo> fantastic news

[17:10] <nine> In other words RakuAST compiles fully functional Test, Test::Utils and friends
