[15:57] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/02/14/2022-07-unsigned-released/
[16:11] <lizmat> m: use nqp; say nqp::iseq_i(my uint $ = 18446744073709551615,-1)   # nine, I wonder if we're also going to need iseq_u and related ops

[21:34] <nine> I'm not sure that would be useful. If there was an nqp::iseq_u, then if you have to variables with values 18446744073709551615 and -1 respectively and you wanted to compare them with iseq_u, you'd have to type cast the int to uint first (QASTCompilerMAST will do that for you) and the result would still be the same, i.e. true.

[21:46] <lizmat> I was more thinking an iseq_u would first check whether the sign bit is the same when given mixed uint int types
[21:46] <lizmat> if they are not the same, then the values are not the same
[21:46] <lizmat> when given two ints or two uints, just compare the bits
[21:47] <lizmat> does that make sense?
[22:06] <nine> No, it doesn't, because the op mandates what the input types are and an iseq_u would obviously take 2 uints and that's what the compiler has to give it
[22:06] <japhb> nine: I think that may be why timo commented about iseq_ui
[22:06] <nine> So the compiler has to generate the coercion code and then the iseq_u op cannot know that 18446744073709551615 once was -1
[22:07] <nine> So the compiler has to generate the coercion code and then the iseq_u op cannot know that 18446744073709551615 once was -1
[22:07] <japhb> To check if a uint and an int were the same
[22:07] <nine> indeed

[23:23] <lizmat> nine: ok, I now understand the problem  :-)
