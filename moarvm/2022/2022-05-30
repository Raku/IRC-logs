[07:26] <Nicholas> [* GOOD *]
[07:26] <Nicholas> which was almost typo'd as [* HOOF *]
[07:26] <Nicholas> not quite sure why
[07:27] <japhb> GOOD HOOF?
[07:28] <japhb> Sounds like something a horse might say.
[07:29] <Nicholas> no, just "HOOF", rather than "GOOD". I guess my left hand had an off-by-one on the keyboard, but my right was right

[17:54] <nine> Understanding is not required, only obedience!
[17:58] <nine> This now gives me a True for the first time: RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ./rakudo-m -e 'role Foo[$i] { method foo() { $i } }; class Bar does Foo[Int] {}; say Bar.foo =:= Int'
[18:00] <nine> And I managed to do that by porting over the code of finish_code_object and compile_in_context, without fully understanding what it actually does... Apparently the lexical FixupList stuff I spent yesterday afternoon on is not even necessary for this example
