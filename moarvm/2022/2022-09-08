[00:22] <reol> Hi. I think the IO::Socket implementation could need some attention.
[00:22] <reol> IO::Socket.native-descriptor segfaults on uv_fileno after MVM_io_fileno.
[00:23] <reol> here is how to reproduce: my $sock = await IO::Socket::Async.connect('::1', 32123); $sock.close; $sock.native-descriptor;
[01:08] <japhb> After closing, the native descriptor doesn't make sense.
[01:20] <reol> close sets it nqp::null. Either MVM shouldn't segfault on that or nqp::filenofh() needs to be guarded from null arguments.

[01:25] <reol> the bug doesn't manifest with valgrind attached btw.

[13:43] <reol> is there a mailing list for moarvm related issues and bug reports?
[13:48] <jnthn> No. Issues get reported on the repository's GitHub issue tracker
[13:48] <tellable6> 2022-08-22T02:28:32Z #moarvm <vrurg_> jnthn I suspect a race in the dispatcher. Can you confirm? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5039
[13:49] <timo> sup jnthn :)
[13:49] <reol> I no longer use github. An alternative would be handy 
[13:50] <jnthn> Hi timo, how's things?
[13:52] * jnthn is super busy with $dayjob but otherwise fine :)
[13:53] <reol> maybe I just drop my notes here so you can take a look and file a bug report at github as needed.
