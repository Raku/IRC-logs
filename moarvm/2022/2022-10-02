[19:18] <Voldenet> backward compatibility always introduces ugly (and stagnated) apis, it's better idea to migrate the old files on load
[19:19] <Voldenet> it introduces nice feature of making old code slower and slower until it gets migrated to the newer version of the bytecode
[19:20] <Voldenet> making deprecated things slower is a good thing, because it forces the programmer to look into the issue, but it isn't breaking
[19:21] <MasterDuke> i'll admit i'm not 100% certain of the details around bytecode loading and the implications of (re)using the deprecated slots

[19:30] <Voldenet> the above is just my philosophical approach to the topic, I wish things worked that way

[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #1722: Use 2-char-at-a-time version of jeaii's itoa
[19:46] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1722
[19:47] <nine> MasterDuke: doesn't matter. We're up to DEPRECATED_115. So those 60s must be quite old already.
[19:48] <MasterDuke> cool
[19:48] <MasterDuke> probably afk for a while, will check back later&
