[06:20] <nine> It's 18 degrees outside and raining. That _is_ a good morning :)

[06:22] <Nicholas> It's >25 and not.

[06:22] <Nicholas> The cellar is cool, but the rest of the house is about 25 too.

[06:23] <Nicholas> I have plenty of coffee, but I'm running low on tea. (Shops are open)

[06:35] <Voldenet> be glad you're not in the US, 60 degrees is considered normal there

[06:36] <Voldenet> absolute madness

[14:55] <nine> That's now 484 spec test files passing and 342 without doing a non-RakuAST spectest run first. Btw. to me that second number is the more important one as I'm working mostly on getting precompilation of those test dependencies working right.
