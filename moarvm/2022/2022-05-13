[13:56] <vrurg> nine: How hard would it be to get https://gist.github.com/niner/f1f523c4b146e29323d68cbe067c4496 fully implemented in the master?

[14:02] <Nicholas> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C2x -- Labels can appear before declarations and at the end of compound statements

[14:02] <Nicholas> took long enough (um, technically, still unbounded as it hasn't shipped)

[14:03] <Nicholas> we expect actual compilers to implement it some point in 2038

[14:07] <nine> vrurg: just needs going through atomic ops to check where else that fix is needed

[14:08] <nine> Nicholas: since gcc already accepts this, I'd say we expect actual compilers to implement it right away, and msvc to support it in 2098

[14:08] <vrurg> May I dare ask you to have it done? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4917 depends on it.

[14:09] <nine> If someone else joins in the RakuAST work ;)

[14:11] <vrurg> Wish I could. The problem is my second job doesn't allow me to start on RakuAST, but at the same time the PR is fixing a big problem in the production code. :(

[14:12] <nine> Sounds like you got too many jobs

[14:12] <vrurg> Just two. :)

[14:14] <vrurg> BTW, the second job lets me use Raku for production and its the only place where I chose what to use.

[14:15] <nine> Then get rid of the first job =)

[14:17] <vrurg> That's the one where the main income comes from!

[14:18] <nine> This life thing is so complicated

[14:19] <vrurg> Frankly, it wasn't totally my voluntary choice to get the second one. But eventually it turned to be for better as I currently can buy more for some troops in Ukraine.

[14:20] <vrurg> Anyway, maybe just apply the patch from your gist? That's all I currently need.

[14:20] <nine> Certainly one of the more unexpecte expenses

[14:20] <nine> Stand by. Testing a better version of that fix

[14:20] <vrurg> Good. :)

[14:21] <vrurg> Ok, I'm off to do the first job. Have tons of emails to process. :)

[14:21] <vrurg> Thanks!

[14:21] <nine> Have...fun I guess?

[14:24] <vrurg> Grrrr...

[14:27] <vrurg> It's so much fun to find out that CISCO telephony servers doesn't work when is ran with a vmware snapshopt on their VM! Why? They only know. But if an upgrade goes sideways then the only way to recover is to use their backup/restore process which may take hours sometimes! 

[14:27] <vrurg> Oh, great thanks! Will now wait for the next bump.

[14:34] <nine> Pushed the bumps

[14:40] <vrurg> Rebased and updated the PR. And if nobody object the names of new entities (Lock::Soft and $*STACK-ID), then I will consider merging it next week.

[15:15] <nine> I get the impression that whatever currying is NYI on RakuAST :/

[16:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Sure isn't, that's another of the "when does it happen" questions I'm wrestling with when I get thinking time on this

[17:03] <nine> I wonder how much of what I implement you'll turn upside down when you find out what it should really look like :)
