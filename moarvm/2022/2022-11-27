[15:29] <timo> ctrl-c-ing pretty much anywhere inside moar's Configure.pl doesn't reach the configure process which maybe it should

[15:29] <timo> i ctrl-c'd it while "updating submodules" because wifi had just gone down, and it continued thinking everything was fine

[15:30] <timo> and then of course "make" complained that something in some submodule was missing

[19:03] <timo> so i was looking into validate_static_frame again and had it do a bit of measuring. i found a bunch of static frames that were small but took suspiciously long to run. however, running them a second time was faster by a big factor, so i'll have to assume it's due to some intermittent work, like maybe mimalloc doing something?

[19:32] <timo> pro tip: i get much better results from perf record -g when i also supply --call-graph dwarf,4096

[20:30] <lizmat> NQP stopped building for me.  Steps to reproduce:

[20:31] <lizmat> git clone https://github.com/raku/nqp.git  

[20:31] <lizmat> cd nqp

[20:31] <lizmat> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar && make && make test

[20:31] <lizmat> all is fine

[20:31] <lizmat> update tools/templates/MOAR_REVISION

[20:31] <lizmat> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar && make && make test

[20:32] <lizmat> after rebuilding MoarVM successfully:

[20:32] <lizmat> +++ Preparing MOAR build directories

[20:32] <lizmat> ++++++ Building MOAR backend

[20:32] <lizmat> +++ Generating	gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.nqp

[20:32] <lizmat> +++ Compiling	gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.moarvm

[20:32] <lizmat> make: *** [gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.moarvm] Killed: 9

[20:36] <lizmat> taking the steps:

[20:37] <lizmat> git clone https://github.com/raku/nqp.git  

[20:37] <lizmat> cd nqp

[20:37] <lizmat> update tools/templates/MOAR_REVISION

[20:37] <lizmat> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar && make && make test

[20:37] <lizmat> and all is fine

[20:37] <lizmat> There is *defintely* something in the current config process borked  :-(

[21:13] <MasterDuke> Â lizmat: fwiw, i've never run into the problem you're seeing. my setup is three separate repos with a common --prefix

[21:13] <MasterDuke> timo: i always use --call-graph=dwarf, but don't know what that `,4096` does

[21:27] <MasterDuke> ugexe: could zef searching be made case insensitive by default? i just search for `mi6` and got 0 hits, then for `app::mi6` and still 0

[21:29] <MasterDuke> heh, especially since the script it installs is `mi6`

[22:01] <Guest45> Hi all

[22:06] <Guest45> I was watching a presentation about GraalVM, it seemed similar to Parrotvm. Their goals were the same right?

[22:07] <MasterDuke> i would say similar, not exactly the same though

[22:09] <MasterDuke> the goal of enabling polyglot programming is pretty similar, but i don't remember parrot having the goal of enabling compilation to native executables (though i was never involved in parrot, this is just from what i remember reading about it)

[22:09] <Guest45> wow

[22:10] <Guest45> this is what I was thinking, it didn't produce native exes.

[22:15] <MasterDuke> huh. i just was testing a patch that made a very small change to implement MVM_recalloc using mi_rezalloc, and it causes an `MoarVM panic: Register types do not match between value and node` early when building nqp. i guess that means somewhere we're MVM_recallocing some memory that wasn't allocated by one of the mimalloc zero-initializing

[22:15] <MasterDuke> functions

[22:25] <MasterDuke> hm, a search doesn't find any obvious such cases.
