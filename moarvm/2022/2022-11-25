[01:55] <MasterDuke> vrurg: in nqp, dynamics can just pop into existence

[01:56] <MasterDuke> nqp: sub a() { my @b := @*c; say(nqp::elems(@b)) }; nqp::push(@*c, 1); nqp::push(@*c, "d"); a()    # vrurg

[01:56] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[01:56] <vrurg> MasterDuke: in what context they are vivified? GLOBAL?

[01:56] <MasterDuke> dunno

[01:57] <vrurg> nqp: sub a() { my @b := @*c; say(nqp::elems(@b)) }; nqp::push(@*c, 1); nqp::push(@*c, "d"); a(); say(nqp::elems(@*c));

[01:57] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «2␤2␤»

[01:57] <MasterDuke> i just noticed it happened and took advantage of it years ago, hadn't thought about it again until just now

[01:57] <vrurg> Ok, it explains.

[01:58] <vrurg> Anyway, I'm working on drifting away from that mechanism and trying to get use of $*CURRENT-FILE in the context of current compunit compilation.

[02:00] <MasterDuke> cool

[02:16] <MasterDuke> nine: with the patch as is and default MoarVM Configure.pl settings, there's no easily noticeable decrease in CORE.e compile time. if i build MoarVM with `--no-mimalloc`, then the patch does seem to improve CORE.e compile times, from ~3.5s down to ~3.3s (both of which are slower than when using mimalloc)

[02:22] <MasterDuke> so admittedly, not the most impactful of changes. i do think reducing allocs is good in general, but i guess amdahl strikes again
