[06:19] <Nicholas> good *, *

[06:36] <japhb> *.good(*)

[06:43] <Voldenet> * ==>> good(*)

[06:46] <nine> *.^good

[07:14] <japhb> Oooh, very nice nine -- you win for DRY

[08:59] <lizmat> good *, all

[09:00] <lizmat> so I have this new MacMini / MacOS Monterey 

[09:00] <lizmat> and I get failures installing anything that calls e.g.libcryoto

[09:01] <lizmat> such as IO::Socket::SSL: ... is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way

[09:01] <lizmat> I seem to recall that *was* an issue in the past, but apparently it's also in the present?

[09:03] <lizmat> ah, it seems https://github.com/sergot/openssl/issues/81 has some clues

[09:03] <Nicholas> I have an $ork M1 laptop, but I've not been trying to install libraries on it. Most $ork is happening on an x86_64 thing that is good at spinning its fans.

[09:04] <Nicholas> so I can't help. Sorry

[09:08] <lizmat> thanks for trying :-)

[09:10] <Nicholas> My little fight today has been with virtualbox. Today I Learned that there is a hard coded undocumented DHCP server created on 192.168.56.100 -- https://www.virtualbox.org/browser/vbox/trunk/src/VBox/Main/xml/Settings.cpp#L2434

[09:11] <Nicholas> woe betide you if you manually configure your virual machine's interface to use that IP

[13:54] <[Coke]> eek

[15:23] <nine> jnthn: IMPL-TO-QAST-COMP-UNIT is definitely too late to create the RakuAST::IMPL::QASTContext. For BEGIN time execution we need at least access to the SC. The QASTContext is probably also the only good place for those sub_id_to_[[cloned_]?code_object|sc_idx] lookup hashes.

[15:23] <nine> I do wonder though if we actually still need those hashes
