[13:36] <MasterDuke> complete change of topics, but i think a lot of other languages have added a bitcount/popcount/whatever-you-want-to-call-the-function-that-returns-the-number-of-ones-set-in-the-binary-representation-of-a-number, should raku get one too?

[18:06] <japhb> lizmat: There's some more that would be valuable there ... for example: least significant set bit, most significant set bit.  Also, I think there are CPU instructions for some of these when dealing with native types, so that may be what MasterDuke was thinking of.

[18:06] <lizmat> well.... yeah, I just wanted to point out there's an interface for it already  :-)

[19:08] <MasterDuke> yeah, i would propose a new nqp op. i think jvm/js have builtins for it, and so do libtommath and gmp

[19:09] <MasterDuke> btw, any details on possible/planned dates for rakudo core conf?

[19:12] <lizmat> MasterDuke: maybe we should start with people stating when they can *not* be there at all

[19:16] <MasterDuke> ha. this little thing called covid has been annoying. i hoped that my couple years in the uk would mean a lot more european raku conferences and such, but no such luck. and now we're moving back to the states in july

[19:16] <lizmat> ah... ok, so would June still work for you ?

[19:16] <lizmat> or will you already be too busy packing ?

[19:17] <MasterDuke> maybe i could do a day or two june 12-18, but i wouldn't want to promise anything

[19:20] <MasterDuke> and probably a realistic estimate for when i'd be free after the move would be october, what with moving, stuff arriving, moving into the new house, etc

[19:20] <MasterDuke> so i wouldn't recommend planning anything around me

[19:22] <MasterDuke> (also, i'll probably have a lot less time for raku stuff for the next couple months (and then less conveniently time-zoned))

[19:39] <MasterDuke> i have an annoying number of almost-finished-except-for-a-last-really-annoying-bit PRs, hopefully i can finish up at least one before my time is (even more) reduced

[21:02] <MasterDuke> interesting. using `@a = ` vs `$a :=` with the binary sha1 op gives a different digest

[21:46] <lizmat> ah?

[21:46] <lizmat> example?

[21:50] <MasterDuke> `rakudo-m -e 'use nqp; my int @a = "src/core.c/Int.pm6".IO.slurp(:bin); my $b; my $s = now; $b := nqp::binarysha1(@a) for ^10_000; say now - $s; say $b' gives AA4E6E40AB7A4F867CAE21A18D4A5024C2FBCAD2

[21:50] <MasterDuke> `rakudo-m -e 'use nqp; my $a := "src/core.c/Int.pm6".IO.slurp(:bin); my $b; my $s = now; $b := nqp::binarysha1($a) for ^10_000; say now - $s; say $b'` gives D10659C9C57676112F06DEC45CA5D9FE93805A8B

[21:51] <MasterDuke> `sha1sum src/core.c/Int.pm6` gives fc1db10480cc2f52cb11b22fff807c5db89a3474

[21:51] <MasterDuke> `rakudo-m -e 'use nqp; my $a := "src/core.c/Int.pm6".IO.slurp; my $b; my $s = now; $b := nqp::sha1($a) for ^10_000; say now - $s; say $b'` gives FC1DB10480CC2F52CB11B22FFF807C5DB89A3474

[21:52] <MasterDuke> but i'm off to bed, something to investigate later

[21:52] <lizmat> when you slurp with :bin, any utf-8 in the file, will remain separate bytes, whereas with a string, they're normalized to codepoints ?

[21:53] <lizmat> so: they would only be the same if the file would be pure ASCII ?
