[15:01] <[Coke]> rakudo

[15:02] <Nicholas> I might vanish AFK without much warning, but I think I'm correct in saying

[15:02] <Nicholas> 1) rakudo doesn't cross compile

[15:02] <Nicholas> 2) you can/could cross compile NQP from one VM backend to another (so how JVM and MoarVM got started)

[15:02] <Nicholas> 3) the C code of MoarVM might be cross-compilable, but I don't think that that works currently (or ever)

[15:03] <Nicholas> and that's about all. So your statement "Rakudo" which I think was an aswner to "Cross compile what?" doesn't make sense. (I believe)

[15:03] <Nicholas> The right question/answer pair is one of the lower level things

[15:04] <[Coke]> Thanks

[18:56] <lizmat> [Coke]: also for reference: once you have a MoarVM bytecode file, you can run that with any MoarVM executable (well, of the same API version) is my understanding

[21:13] <nine> correct
