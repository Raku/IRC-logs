[06:59] <Nicholas> timo: on the assumption that the bytecode stream is variable width (and about that much knowledge of this matter) I can't really see how that would go well with SIMD for optimisation. *However*, looking to see if there are ways to make the validator branch-free (OK, branch-reduced) might be a win. More stuff data/table driven, and fewer switch statements?

[07:48] *** sena_kun joined
[07:51] <Voldenet> variable length streams can be vectorized (utf8 -> utf16 converters do that with good results)

[09:42] <lizmat> nine: trying to bump MoarVM on NQP, but it doesn't build:

[09:42] <lizmat> nqp % make                                             

[09:42] <lizmat> +++ Preparing MOAR build directories

[09:42] <lizmat> ++++++ Building MOAR backend

[09:42] <lizmat> +++ Compiling	gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.moarvm

[09:42] <lizmat> make: *** [gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.moarvm] Killed: 9

[09:51] <lizmat> hmmm...nuking install dir fixes it

[09:52] <lizmat> looks like the build process is getting poisoned by previous builds  :-(

[10:00] <lizmat> same issue with bumping NQP on Rakudo...  

[10:01] <lizmat> but nuking install/bin in rakudo solved that
