[12:09] <Kaiepi> what do spesh problems tend to look like?

[13:16] <nine> Kaiepi: usually, error messages that don't make any sense at all. In the worst case segfaults.

[14:11] <Kaiepi> there's this bizarre timing issue that prevents me from benchmarking more than one code block in a script

[14:11] <Kaiepi> it goes away with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1, but not MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1

[14:12] <Kaiepi> past the first code block that ever gets iterated, there's a jump in how long it takes for the code object to invoke, even when written identically, but as different code objects

[14:13] <Kaiepi> it happens even when each code block is iterated over in parallel

[14:14] <Kaiepi> cloning that first code object and iterating with that is fine, though

[16:16] <nine> Well that's the point of spesh: to take data collected at runtime and create versions of the code that process similar inputs faster. Of course that does make benchmarking harder.
