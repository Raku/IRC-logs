[00:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> I see continuations as more of an implementation detail 

[00:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> We don't talk about them anywhere else so it feels a bit off

[00:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> $*PROMISE-ID or $*START-ID at lesat are couched in Raku terms, although neither seems perfect

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Fix errata in docs/debug-server-protocol.md

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: The debug server protocol document did not match actual server behavior in

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: several instances, and had various typos and missing details as well.

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Because all of these errors were in the document, *not* in the code, fix

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: these errors with a pure errata update rather than a protocol minor version

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: change.

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: See the top of the diff for a list of all fixed errata.

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/99730293f6
