[15:29] <nine> RakuAST actually makes this harder. In the old compiler frontend the actions would directly create the QAST. BEGIN time effects like adding the result instructions to a role body take such a QAST tree and manipulate it while in RakuAST, we try to keep manipulations to the RakuAST and then generate the correct QAST from that.

[15:30] <nine> BEGIN time execution turns the whole thing upside down because at the time when we're still assembling the RakuAST, we actually already need the QAST for code blocks.

[19:36] <ggoebel_> nine: nine++ respect and appreciation for your RakuAST work. It is nice to see the progress and following your RakuAST related dialog with jnthn and others

[19:38] <jdv> rakuAST sounds cool and hard.  nine++ good luck!

[20:04] <drakonis> extremely cool work
