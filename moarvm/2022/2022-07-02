[00:18] <timo> would have been no problem if btrfs send had worked :)

[00:18] <timo> adding the new device to the btrfs volume, then removing the old device has been advised against for some reason

[00:19] <timo> i'm running restorecon now, but setroubleshootd is flipping its absolute shit

[00:24] <timo> i have been wanting to get rid of setroubleshootd for a longlong time

[07:29] <nine> timo: I have always migrated to new (local) storage by adding the new device and removing the old. Worked flawlessly every time.

[16:19] <nine> We are now at 500 passing spec test files on RakuAST :)

[16:20] <nine> And the latest batch of commits fixed those annoying infinite loops in spec tests

[17:01] <nine> 358 without doing a non-RakuAST spectest run first!

[17:02] <nine> So the difference went down from 180 to 142.

[21:06] <timo> super cool

[22:09] <vrurg> Any potential difference in how well code would be inlined via `boot-code-constant` and `raku-meth-call` dispatchers? Considering that actual code bodies are gonna be basically the same up to use of arguments vs. attributes.
