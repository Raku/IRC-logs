[06:11] <Nicholas> good *, #moarvm 

[06:11] <Nicholas> Today's weather *was* ducks. (kinda sorta. In that, there were 4, flying rather low over me.)

[06:13] <nine> Weather is more sparrowy here, partly blackbirdly with gusts of pigeons

[06:39] <MasterDuke> usually seagull and pigeon in the morning here, turning into sprinkles of magpie in the afternoon

[16:21] <nine> Looks to me like instead of grammar and actions detecting the onlystar situation and acting on it, the RakuAST::Routine node can simply look at it's body and if it only consists of a Whatever apply the only_star trait

[16:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> nine: Yes, that'd also avoid a situation where one could manually construct an AST that looks like it should be an onlystar routine but is actually not one

[16:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Even if pretty-printing would come out the same

[16:24] <nine> Why is onlystar even a trait btw? Wouldn't calling set_onlystar on the metaobject be enough?

[16:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> Probably, yes. Not sure why it'd need to be a trait.

[16:25] <nine> Especially since there's a bit of a bootstrapping issue with the trait anyway. And the trait is neither documented nor spectested.

[16:28] <jnthnwrthngtn> Sounds like we're better off without it, then.
