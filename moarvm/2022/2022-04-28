[21:01] <japhb> I have mixed feelings about that paper.  On the one hand, the measurements they did do are careful, and I like that they have tables and graphs with confidence intervals.  On the other hand, the reasoning in a couple places is handwavey (and wrong I think, in at least one case), and there's no small amount of self-hype embedded.

[21:03] <japhb> Gripping hand for me though is that the whole bit about measuring actual latency did a really poor job of talking about latency jitter.  (I mean yes, you could kindof pull that out of the shape of figure 3, but otherwise it's not well covered.)
