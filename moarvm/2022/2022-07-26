[09:16] <timo> i wonder what happens if we separate the nursery into "needs cleanup" and "doesn't need cleanup" depending on the repr, since not all reprs have a gc_clean or whatever it's called

[09:16] *** sena_kun left

[09:18] <timo> perhaps running with a humongous nursery could be an interesting optimization for maximizing throughput, and clearing the no-cleanup-needed nursery is extremely cheap of course

[09:19] <timo> gc_free is the name of the function

[10:42] <timo> imagine getting to above-second gc times, but load-balancing with feedback for when a gc run is about to happen so other nodes could take over for that moment
