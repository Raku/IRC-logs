[01:13] <MasterDuke> B1B3773A05C0ED0176787A4F1574FF0075F7521E vs 3C8B9F4B983AFA9F644D26E2B34FA3E03A2BEF16, i think that's sufficiently different

[01:14] <MasterDuke> what i am trying to figure out now is why the implementation i copied from git's source is giving different results...

[01:25] <MasterDuke> it seems to be a bit faster than ours. however, nqp::sha1 actually spends most of the time in MVM_string_utf8_encode_substr when you sha1 a large string (like the contents of a source file)

[01:26] <MasterDuke> but making that faster seems quite a bit more involved. and i think is going to require something i've brought up before, which is making more specific functions. currently the grapheme iterator checks the string's storage type at every call

[01:26] <MasterDuke> it should predict perfectly, but it would be even faster not to have that at all...

[01:28] <MasterDuke> jnthn, nine, timo, japhb, etc: any ideas for how to make MVM_string_utf8_encode_substr faster? my thought right now is something like creating MVM_string_gi_get_grapheme_for_(32|ascii|8) functions, but i'm open to other suggestions

[21:41] <vrurg> jnthn: Do you actually mind merging https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5117? 

[22:05] <MasterDuke> looks like git's sha1 implementation does different padding, but i'm not sure why

[22:08] <MasterDuke> hm, and the outputs don't even seem to match if i don't pad either...

[23:16] <jnthn> vrurg: I'll try and look at it tomorrow; I'm finally free from $dayjob for a while 

[23:16] <jnthn> vrurg: If I still haven't commented on it tomorrow, just merge it

[23:17] <vrurg> jnthn: Thanks! I wanted it because stumbled upon an error without any location. Debugging is kind of a nightmare then. :)
