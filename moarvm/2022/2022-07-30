[12:27] <lizmat> hmm..... looks like Rakudo is borked at the moment

[12:28] <lizmat> doing a 'perl Configure.PL --gen-moar' on a fresh Rakudo checkout, refuses to build

[12:30] <lizmat> It seems to fail on:

[12:30] <lizmat> % /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/bin/moar --version

[12:30] <lizmat> zsh: killed     /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/bin/moar --version

[12:30] <lizmat> % ls -ls /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/bin/moar

[12:38] <lizmat> jnthn ^^

[12:38] <lizmat> at least on MacOS for me

[12:41] <lizmat> timo ^^

[13:12] <jnthn> Does building some earlier commit work? For example c315523ab/

[13:12] <tellable6> 2022-07-28T00:25:56Z #moarvm <vrurg> jnthn would like to ask for your opinion on https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/339

[13:12] <tellable6> 2022-07-28T07:22:53Z #raku-dev <Kaiepi> jnthn, what's the deal with SixModelObject.get_attribute_native's void return value?

[13:13] <timo> haha did i break something again? :D

[13:14] <timo> but that seems like a really rough asplosion and so early in running

[13:14] <timo> lizmat: can you lldb or some other debugger the moar --version command?

[13:16] <lizmat> the thing is, now it even fails on HEAD for me  :-(

[13:17] <timo> we can still try to figure it out even if it's something in your system doing it

[13:18] <lizmat> lldb install/bin/moar --version

[13:19] <lizmat> should be enough, right ?

[13:19] <lizmat> % lldb install/bin/moar 

[13:19] <lizmat> (lldb) target create "install/bin/moar"

[13:19] <lizmat> zsh: killed     lldb install/bin/moar

[13:19] <lizmat> WTF

[13:21] <timo> wild. the mac equiv of strace is dtrace, right? try that?

[13:23] <lizmat> I've rebooted my M1Mac, now starting with a fresh checkout at HEAD

[14:03] <timo>   /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/bin/nqp-m version 2022.04-1-gf3054503f is outdated, 2022.06-1-ge3c439991 expected. at /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib/NQP/Config.pm line 192.

[14:04] <lizmat> but just above that it said NQP was installed and updated ?

[14:06] <timo> * a9fcd5a74 - Add missing SC write barriers to atomic attr bind and cas (3 months ago) <Stefan Seifert>

[14:06] <timo> you're far behind, do you perhaps have some local changes that prevent a pull from updating your master?

[14:07] *** linkable6 left
[14:07] <lizmat> I guess I have on my IntelMac

[14:07] <lizmat> haven't used that for raku development for a while now

[14:07] <lizmat> let me nuke it and start over

[14:07] *** linkable6 joined
[14:09] <timo> we could totally put something in Configure.pl or somewhere nearby that outputs the date of the commits checked out in moar, nqp, and rakudo

[14:10] <timo> to give a hint when it's out of whack

[14:11] <lizmat> I think that's a good general idea

[14:11] <timo> put it somewhere that's likely to be included whenever someone pastes an error they're getting

[14:25] <lizmat> ok, the problem on the IntelMini was a false negative

[14:26] <timo> phew, good to know

[14:49] *** dogbert11 left
[14:59] <lizmat> bumped rakudo to MoarVM master

[15:06] <lizmat> ok, red alert over

[15:06] <lizmat> I have no idea what happened, but the bumped Rakudo now builds ok on my M1Mac
