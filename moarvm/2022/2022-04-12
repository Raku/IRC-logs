[08:36] <lizmat> morning!
[08:36] <lizmat> Q: in nqp:   my @a := [];   is really the same as  just "my @a", is it not ?
[08:36] <lizmat> except it does more ?
[08:50] <lizmat> ah, doesn't appear to be doing more
[08:52] <MasterDuke> yeah, timings for `my @a`, `my @a := []`, and `my $a := nqp::list` all seem pretty similar
