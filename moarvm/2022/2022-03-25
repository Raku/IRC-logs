[10:21] <lizmat> Good * to all

[10:21] <lizmat> in strange findings today:   looks like nqp::rename returns the source string, rather than 0 on success

[10:34] <nine> That's an oddity of the QAST compiler. It treats every op as if it had a return value, and you're usually reading just the first argument register

[10:38] <lizmat> but that means a lot of the documentation at https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown is basically bogus  :-(

[10:38] <lizmat> "Rename file $from to file $to. Return 0 on success, throw an exception on failure."

[10:39] <lizmat> I guess: "Rename file $from to file $to.  Throws an exception on failure." would be a better description

[10:43] <nine> Well that's just wrong, yes

[10:44] <nine> And your version plain getter

[10:44] <nine> better

[12:09] <bartolin> just for the record: nqp::rename *does* return 0 on the JVM backend (on success)

[12:10] <bartolin> (and maybe the documentation is from those days ...)
