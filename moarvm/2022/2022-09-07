[17:21] <timo> did we ever check out how good our hashing function does for the data we have in general? count average probing length or whatever?

[20:06] <timo> guess what people

[20:07] <timo> https://scan.coverity.com/projects/paultcochrane-moarvm?tab=overview

[20:12] <japhb> Sign in page.  What are we supposed to see there?

[20:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 4575c47456 | (Timo Paulssen)++ | src/spesh/worker.c

[20:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: use correct format string in spesh log skip line

[20:15] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/4575c47456

[20:16] <timo> the coverity scan overview page for moarvm

[20:16] <timo> including the "view defects" button that opens the viewer app where you can go through issues they found in our source

[20:17] <japhb> Oh I thought the "guess what people" was talking about a particular issue

[20:18] <timo> just a "i scanned the sauce finally after people asked a couple of times for a few years"
