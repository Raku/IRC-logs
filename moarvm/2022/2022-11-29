[01:47] <MasterDuke> ugexe: `zef search mi6` returns 0 results. `zef search Mi6` returns 69 results. `zef search app::mi6` returns 0 results. `zef search App::Mi6` returns 48 results. i would expect both the lowercase versions to return the same number of results as the ones with uppercase (or maybe make a 'did you mean <...>?' suggestion)

[02:04] <ugexe> yeah i agree

[02:05] <ugexe> the .contains here -- https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/d1fb6176cfbb461f713e140782380265c30911a1/lib/Zef/Repository/Ecosystems.rakumod#L159 -- should be case insensitive 

[02:08] <MasterDuke> i don't know what .contains candidate is being used, but a bunch of them have a `:i(ignorecase)` flag available
