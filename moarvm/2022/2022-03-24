[10:47] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hah, that StackOverflow issue that got linked mentions *Parrot*. How does one come accross a Rakudo that old these days? :)
[10:47] <lizmat> uname -v #1-Microsoft Wed Dec 31 14:42:53 PST 2014
[10:49] <Nicholas> not sure when debian stopped packaging Rakudo with parrot.
[10:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> Wow
[10:49] <Nicholas> But that will be one answer. but it might be "your debian is ancient"
[10:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> "stable" :)
[10:50] <Nicholas> stable, old stable, old old stable, fell-off-LTS-and-is-definately-special-biologist-word
[10:56] <Voldenet> wsl flavour of ubuntu: `rakudo is already the newest version (2015.11-2build1).`
[11:09] <lizmat> that's even before the first official release
[11:14] <MasterDuke> wonder if there's a way to get wsl to include something newer
[11:21] <MasterDuke> btw, Nicholas, jnthnwrthngtn, nine, anybody who knows more about linking than i do, any thoughts about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1691 ?
[11:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> I know linking on Mac tends to be weird...now, let's see if this is about mac :)
[11:21] <jnthnwrthngtn> hah, no :)
[11:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Wait, what does --static do?
[11:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> I thought that was the thing that didn't give you a moar.so, for the Raku ext ops to link against
[11:22] <Nicholas> "um, not what one thinks it should" IIRC when I was trying to use it to work around something
[11:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> In which case, I'm surprised you even got a Raku that compiles
[11:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or at least it linked against a previously left-behind .so in extops?
[11:23] <Nicholas> oh, completele guess - it might cause symbols in the main program not to be exposed, and hence the dynamic load of the .so won't link properly (and maybe get a NULL instead of failing hard and early)
[11:23] <MasterDuke> well, after using --static, `ldd moar` no longer shows `libmoar.so => //home/dan/Source/perl6/install/lib/libmoar.so (0x00007f9fd9e09000)`
[11:23] <Nicholas> or the "previosuly left behind"
[11:23] <Nicholas> I'm a bit snowed under by new crazy work code
[11:24] <MasterDuke> --static using the libmoar.a instead of the .so, right?
[11:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think so, but my understanding is that extops would not work out this way, because they'd end up with an entire separate MoarVM linked in to them, rather than sharing the dynamic library?
[11:26] <MasterDuke> hm. i'd have expected some other/earlier failure then, but this is pretty far outside my experience/knowledge
[11:28] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/disp/inline_cache.c#L260 this is what happens and then the oops hits up at line 234
[11:30] <MasterDuke> https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/NWPVQSKVWDKA75PDEIJNJIFL5C5SJXB2/ is what inspired me to experiment with --static. it is faster, stage parse drops by ~1s
[11:32] <MasterDuke> also experimenting with -flto and -fno-semantic-interposition
[11:32] <nine> FWIW I haven't seen a difference with lto. Except for the extraordinarily long link time of course
[11:33] <MasterDuke> yeah, it didn't seem to help all that much
[11:34] <MasterDuke> though i'm hoping that once gcc 12 arrives and supports mold, the linking time shouldn't be a problem
[11:37] <nine> It can multi thread the linking, which kind of fixes the runtime issue. But since I couldn't measure any advantage, I didn't persue it further
[11:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> Once we are done with getting rid of extops, we can probably do --static without a problem
[11:57] <MasterDuke> ok, so no reason to pursue this until then?

[12:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> MasterDuke: I don't think it'll work out until then, no
[12:27] <jnthnwrthngtn> By this point we can't have many extops left, a lot went away during new-disp
[12:33] <nine> p6captureouters, p6stateinit, p6setfirstflag, p6takefirstflag, p6setpre, p6clearpre, p6inpre, p6staticouter and p6invokeunder
[12:34] <nine> There's also p6init, but that does just nothing :)
[12:36] <lizmat> so it can go from e.g. src/main.nqp ?
[12:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> Probably not as it does soemthing on other backends
[12:37] <jnthnwrthngtn> Probably on MoarVM we can map it to a noop though and then delete the extop
[12:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> p6staticouter could move into core as a syscall
[12:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> s/core/MoarVM/
[12:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> And compile into that
[13:12] <Nicholas> I'd like extops to go, because then AIX is easier
[13:12] *** reportable6 joined
[14:36] <MasterDuke> oh, using clang to build with `--telemeh` and `--c11-atomics` is broken
