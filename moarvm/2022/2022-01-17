[15:14] <MasterDuke> anybody have a suggestion for what could be happening with that segv uncovered by my new ternary warning in the optimizer?

[15:14] <MasterDuke> m: my $v = 3; my $sign = $v +> 31 ?? -1 !! 1; say $sign          # this one

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb909efce: OUTPUT: «(signal SEGV)»

[15:28] <MasterDuke> if i'm stopped at dispatch_o in the interpreter, is there a good way to see what all the arguments are?

[16:19] <nine> MasterDuke: yes, look at callsite and args

[16:20] <nine> Or just MVM_dump_bytecode(tc) and look at the registers. That's even easier

[16:28] <MasterDuke> the problem with dumping the bytecode is that it's large (in this case especially so) and looking back and forth for that `->` to see where i am is annoying

[16:30] <MasterDuke> but maybe i'm in the right place randomly. i see 'lang-hllize', and then '$!descriptor', and then 'raku-rv-decont'

[16:30] <MasterDuke> so maybe this is where the VMHash is getting upgraded into a P6opaque

[16:32] <MasterDuke> oh, and a callsite doesn't know the argument values

[16:33] <nine> callsite knows how many and what kind of arguments to expect. args holds the register numbers of registers holding these arguments. tc->cur_frame->work holds the registers holding the arguments

[16:35] <MasterDuke> might be nice to create some debug function to prettily print them

[16:39] <MasterDuke> interesting, i

[16:39] <MasterDuke> 'm here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Code.pm6#L25

[16:44] <MasterDuke> well, i noticed that `method prec` is `is raw` in traits.pm6, but no change if i make the one in Code.pm6 `is raw` also
