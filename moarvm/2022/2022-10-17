[18:51] <Oshawott> Nicholas: Laaate getting back to this, but the cross-compilation was mostly so that it might be possible to add a Termux package for Rakudo, since all platforms for their packages are done with a single builder

[18:52] <Oshawott> My current Configure.pl invocation for Rakudo looks like: ./Configure.pl --gen-moar --moar-option="--build=${TERMUX_BUILD_TUPLE}" --moar-option="--host=${TERMUX_HOST_PLATFORM}" --moar-option="--ar=llvm-ar" --moar-option="--cc=clang" --gen-nqp --backends=moar --prefix=$TERMUX_PREFIX

[18:52] <Oshawott> The --host and --build options were something I noticed in the cross-compiled builds for moarvm in debian

[18:53] <Oshawott> As in like, this: http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/moarvm/moarvm_2016.12+dfsg-1.debian.tar.xz

[18:53] <Oshawott> (In the rules file)

[18:54] <Oshawott> I think the packages on this page may have been cross-compiled: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/moarvm

[18:55] <Oshawott> But I'm having a tricky time figuring out how to specifically configure rakudo to gen-moar, while also not defaulting to the host I'm building on

[18:57] <Oshawott> The reason for --host and --build with --cc rather than --compiler is because in the Configure.pl script for moarvm has that as mutually exclusive with the cross-compilation options: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/Configure.pl#L1099

[18:57] <Nicholas> I'm not sure if any debian packages are cross compiled. At times I've had access to most of the platforms listed there (not s390x, and not some of the variants of each CPU) and all the builds were always native

[18:57] <Nicholas> I've neve tried to cross compile. I'm not sure if it ever worked. I doubt that it currently works.

[18:58] <Oshawott> Ooh

[18:58] <Nicholas> and I think if you want to try it, start with trying to build MoarVM from its directory, running ./Configure.pl there

[18:58] <Nicholas> rather than attempting ./Confugre.pl from the Rakudo tree

[18:58] <Oshawott> Yeah! I might play around with it a bit!

[18:58] <Nicholas> but, if you can get MoarVM to build

[18:58] <Oshawott> (I wonder what it would take to get that working..?)

[18:59] <Nicholas> you can build everything else on a different CPU architecture if you have the install paths correct (IIRC)

[18:59] <Nicholas> except, I guess, the linking part of native executables

[18:59] <Nicholas> compiling and linking

[18:59] <Nicholas> because the MoarVM bytecode is platform independent

[18:59] <Nicholas> but anyway, start with trying to build just MoarVM

[18:59] <Nicholas> no, I don't know what it would take

[18:59] <Oshawott> Will do!

[18:59] <Oshawott> I did actually originally have moarvm as its own package, though the gen-moar seemed like it could be convenient if I could figure it out!

[19:00] <Oshawott> I figured I'd ask here in case there was something silly I was missing, since I'm not that great at perl, so dissecting the configure script kinda only got me so far

[19:01] <Oshawott> Nicholas: Thanks for the info..! ^^
