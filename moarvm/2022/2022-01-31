[13:06] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/01/31/2022-05-foo-is-42/

[13:18] <lizmat> I'm stumped with windows CI for the following code:

[13:19] <lizmat> use ValueList; my @a is ValueList = ^10; my @b is ValueList = ^10;

[13:19] <lizmat> it crashes while compiling, but *only* on Windows

[13:19] <lizmat> trying to determine if it is an issue with Windows or the CI on Windows

[13:20] <lizmat> see https://github.com/lizmat/ValueList/actions/runs/1772446095 for the minimal failure case

[15:20] <MasterDuke> weekly: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30145029 and https://blog.openresty.com/en/ylang-intro-part4/#the-ylang-compilers-implementation

[15:20] <notable6> MasterDuke, Noted! (weekly)

[15:28] <lizmat> the odd thing is that there is no overview of the differences between fanlang and raku

[15:30] <MasterDuke> well, i think it's just an implementation detail for them

[15:31] <MasterDuke> agentzh has mentioned some of the differences a while ago in irc

[15:38] <patrickb> o/

[15:39] <patrickb> There is: https://doc.openresty.com/en/plus/fanlang/

[15:40] <lizmat> no multi dispatch feels like   can we even call this Raku?

[15:41] <lizmat> I mean, how can operators in fanlang work without it ?

[15:42] <patrickb> I think it's fair. They named it a Raku dialect. For me that definitely includes any language that implements a clear subset of Raku.

[15:45] <patrickb> If they implemented a lot of functionality that is *not* found in Raku, then I'd have said that "inspired by" would be a better description. But it's a pretty clean subset. (At least that's what I understand from the description.)

[15:45] <MasterDuke> i assume just a single candidate that has a given/when that handles the different types

[15:47] <lizmat> well, no way to check I guess, as it isn't open source ?

[15:48] <MasterDuke> i don't believe it is currently.iirc agentzh talked about maybe opening it up, but i don't think it was a major goal of theirs

[15:48] <patrickb> I'd imagine that there will be some way to access fan lang as soon as it's part of openresty, i.e. a language that can be used by others. ATM it's not public at all. Only used internally.

[15:49] <patrickb> I read something about plans to allow writing OpenResty apps in fanlang.

[22:24] <vrurg> How come nqp::istype(Str, Str:D) can be false in Raku code, but is true in dispatcher code??

[22:52] <timo> vrurg: i hope this isn't it, but related to containers?!

[22:54] <vrurg> No. But I just've realized a few seconds ago that it wasn't Str typeobject but a concrete string. Asynchronous output from NQP and Raku contributed to the confusion.
