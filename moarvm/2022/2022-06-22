[08:11] <nine> Rule #1 when working on RakuAST: if you have no idea where some class might be declared, you'll find it in src/Raku/ast/scoping.rakumod

[09:13] <nine> We're starting to resolve lexicals via HLL fallback for BEGIN time execution :) The end of those giant wrapper frames containing all lexicals from all scopes is coming closer

[09:36] <jnthn> nine: Nice, is there a MoarVM side of that, or is it all done in HLL space?

[09:36] <tellable6> 2022-06-19T20:38:04Z #moarvm <vrurg_> jnthn Is it intentional that method fallback doesn't respect MRO? Because if it is the discrepancy in `handles<m1 m2>` and `handles(*)` is disappointing and misleading when it comes to inheritance.

[09:37] <jnthn> .tell vrurg Think I need an example to understand what you're asking

[09:37] <tellable6> jnthn, I'll pass your message to vrurg

[09:37] <nine> jnthn: I added MVMCode *resolver and MVMCode *dynamic_resolver to MVMCompUnit, a syscall to set those and modified MVM_frame_find_lexical_by_name_outer and MVM_frame_getdynlex_with_frame_walker to call those if they couldn't find a lexical.

[12:50] <nine> And as so often it's the small, simple fixes that bring the most effect :D

[13:13] <jnthn> vrurg: Looks like an oversight; I'd expect the first to work also

[13:14] <vrurg> Because the implementation is based on fallbacks I think it where the fix should be done. Ok, it's now just a matter of finding some time for it.
