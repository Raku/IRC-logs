[16:26] <MasterDuke> `Frame has invalid bytecode start point 207994 (size 40358)` never seen this error before (this isn't on master, i'm playing around with pre-sizing the byte array we write frames into)
[16:46] <dogbert17> I see that nine is back in action. Welcome back :)
[16:49] <nine> Thanks :) Nice knowing that I've not completely rusted in in the snow
[16:50] <Nicholas> you have snow? All we have is wind.
[16:51] <Nicholas> I am really glad that you have located the cause of that bug as it was completely beyond me.
[16:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> A lot of wind here too. The plant pots are all still on the terrace.
[16:51] <Nicholas> aha :-)
[16:51] <Nicholas> yes. One of ours has made a leap from a low wall. A couple of times.
[16:52] <Nicholas> (over the past month)
[16:52] <nine> Well they did have a lot of snow where we were vacationing. Now back to the usual brownish green
[16:52] <Nicholas> aha right.
[17:03] <dogbert17> nine: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1628 has indeed been fixed

[17:27] <MasterDuke> ugh, had to miss my usual week snowboarding these past two years. did do a long weekend in early 2020. we were talking about doing a long weekend next month, but it's tough with small kids anyway and then the crazy numbers in europe just put a nail in it
[17:27] <MasterDuke> but i'm hoping i get out to the usual week next year

[20:46] <MasterDuke> anyone mind taking a look at this diff and trying to spot what i'm missing? https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/9114bd5da9d63a02bfac635e3da1fc0d
[20:46] <MasterDuke> for some reason $indx isn't ending up with the correct value
[21:55] * nine can't see anything obvious
[22:01] <MasterDuke> what i find odd is that when it's wrong, the guess (new size) is high. it should only ever be low (since i have to adjust for the branch in the `@handlers` case manually)
