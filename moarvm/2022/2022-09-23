[11:51] <lizmat> wrong in the sense that apparently the uint is interpreted as an int in the expression  >

[11:52] <jnthn> Looks wrong to me, yes

[11:53] *** vrurg joined
[11:55] <lizmat> looks to be wrong at nqp level:

[11:55] <lizmat> m: my uint $a = 2; my uint $b = -1; say $a; say $b; use nqp; say nqp::isgt_i($a,$b)

[11:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: «2␤18446744073709551615␤1␤»

[11:57] *** vrurg left
[12:00] <lizmat> I probably should make that a MoarVM issue, right ?

[12:07] *** reportable6 left
[12:08] *** reportable6 joined
[12:13] <nine> The nqp::isgt_i($a,$b) result here is correct. You are asking it to interpret the values as (signed) ints. What you want is nqp::isgt_u which doesn't exist yet (but is trivial to implement)

[12:15] *** frost left
[12:22] <lizmat> I'm afraid I'm not tall enough to reach that low hanging fruit

[12:22] <lizmat> I will need something to lift me for that

[12:29] <lizmat> do I just start adding ops to interp.c ?

[12:34] <jnthn> lizmat: 1. Add to src/core/oplist, see the instructions at the top for where to put it. 2) run tools/update_ops.raku. 3) add implementtation in interp.c. 4) Add a mapping in NQP (src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp or similar)

[12:34] <jnthn> (All names from memory, so probably at least one is wrong :))

[12:37] <lizmat> thanks, I'll have a stab at it

[12:43] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::uname

[12:43] <lizmat> interesting

[12:43] <lizmat> wonder what that does on Win

[12:48] <lizmat> ok, will look at this in more depth once I get the next release of App::Rak out

[12:48] <lizmat> which should be soon :-)

[12:49] <lizmat> meanwhile, I'll use 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffff for the largest positive value :-)

[13:50] <patrickb> o/

[13:57] <patrickb> I issued a GitHub App installation request for the MoarVM project. Can someone with permissions to do so grant that request? That app is part of the Rakudo CI bot I'm working on. I don't plan to change the current CI workflow yet, but having the permission allows preparing things and running noninvasive tests.

[14:04] <lizmat> patrickb: fwiw, I've just okd this for rakudo / raku

[14:11] <patrickb> thanks!

[14:13] <patrickb> lizmat: Can you somehow give the app access to the rakudo/nqp repos only?

[14:14] <lizmat> you mean rakudo/rakudo and raku/nqp ?

[14:18] <lizmat> patrickb: afaics, it is already limited to rakudo/rakudo and raku/nqp

[14:23] <[Coke]> I read his send as rakudo&nqp, aye.

[14:31] <patrickb> OK. Then it's already fine in those two repos / projects.

[14:32] <patrickb> So MoarVM/MoarVM is left.

[14:34] <lizmat> patrickb: I don't have sufficient rights for that, I think only jnthn does

[16:09] <patrickb> I don't know. lizmat: Where have you seen the request?

[16:09] <lizmat> in my mail box

[16:09] <jnthn> I saw requests for Raku and rakudo orgs in my mailbox, but not a MoarVM one

[16:10] <lizmat> Subject: [Github] RakudoCIBot is requesting updated permissions

[16:13] <patrickb> Ah, then I'll see if I can re-do the MoarVM request.

[16:14] <patrickb> Maybe I have just re done a request...
