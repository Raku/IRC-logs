[09:45] <lizmat> updated the BUILDPLAN helper module, looks like the BUILDPLAN is not the source of the problem

[10:01] <lizmat> m: class A { has uint $.a; method b { use nqp; nqp::bindattr_u(self,A,q/$!a/,9223372036854775808) } }; dd A.new.b

[10:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «-9223372036854775808␤»

[10:02] <lizmat> nine: looks like at least nqp::bindattr_u is not doing the right thing

[10:03] <lizmat> tracing this back to NQP, looks like something's amiss with that in MoarVM ?

[10:06] <lizmat> I just noticed that MoarVM doesn't have a MVM_nativeref_read_lex_u ?

[10:07] <lizmat> specifically at: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/6model/containers.c#L729

[10:09] <lizmat> and then it really becomes above my pay grade  :-)

[11:11] <lizmat> or maybe it's just nqp::getattr_u that's to blame
