[10:04] <lizmat> could someone confirm that:

[10:04] <lizmat> $ raku -MSIL -e ''

[10:04] <lizmat> segfaults on master ?

[10:07] *** frost left
[10:14] <nine> lizmat: works here

[10:14] <lizmat> hmmmm

[10:16] <lizmat> I guess I'll nuke my install once again later today  :-(

[10:19] <nine> Could be a Mac specific issue though

[10:24] <lizmat> whenever I do an nqp bump, things become unbuildable / unstable  :-(

[10:25] <nine> Have you tried doing a make clean in rakudo before make?

[10:25] <lizmat> will do next time

[10:31] * lizmat clones a fresh rakudo        :-(

[10:34] *** frost left
[10:35] <nine> FWIW there's no reason to clone fresh. If you want to start with a clean slate, you can just use git clean -xfd

[10:35] <nine> That will basically give you a pristine repo

[10:37] *** frost joined
[10:37] <lizmat> getting a fresh clone would at least give me the option to spelunk to try to find out what borked the previous one

[11:40] <lizmat> nine: RakuAST passes 78 test files and 551 spectest files   that still correct?

[12:30] <nine> lizmat: the pushed commits do.

[12:31] <lizmat> I'll take that as a yes  :)

[12:31] <nine> Oh, could actually be 79

[12:31] <nine> But I guess it's not super important to correctly attribute that single test file to the right week :)

[12:31] <lizmat> ok!  :-)
