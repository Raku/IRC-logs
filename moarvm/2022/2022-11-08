[02:14] <MasterDuke> i very strongly suspect it's not actually caused by my PR and just randomly got triggered, but i guess good to know there's a bug out there. maybe gfldex++ can track down if it's already known?

[02:15] <MasterDuke> happened in t/09-moar/01-profilers.t, in the MVM_gcc_libffi job

[07:49] <lizmat> do we actually have a magic value to see if a file is a MoarVM binary ?

[07:50] <lizmat> or some other way to test?

[07:50] <lizmat> or would checking for the .moarvm  extension be enough ?

[07:54] <sortiz> Seems to be MOARVM\r\n at the start.

[08:07] <sortiz> This seems to confirm that: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/moar.c#L554
