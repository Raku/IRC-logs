[07:29] <nine> An odd one though if it is. 2495132133400 is ~~ 2^41

[07:50] <MasterDuke> huh. i just saw a large number and assumed that was the problem since i'm messing with signed/unsigned args handling now

[19:40] <nine> lizmat: sorry, I'm not sure that would do any good. I've had a close look when it happened to me, but didn't learn anything new. At least it's now confirmed that the fix I did back then did indeed not cover this issue.

[19:40] <nine> In other news, I can reproduce the "No such private method 'SET-SELF' on Map" issue in our work code base and it happens even when running just one of the test files in a loop.

[19:41] <nine> I think it's a spesh issue, but so far haven't managed to reproduce even a single time with MVM_SPESH_LOG enabled. Has been running for hours without issue while I can easily reproduce within minutes otherwise.
