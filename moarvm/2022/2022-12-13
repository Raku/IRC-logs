[22:02] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Avoid implicit function declarations in pthread_setname_np probe

[22:02] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[22:02] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Future compilers are likely to disable support for implicit function

[22:02] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: declarations by default, and the probe will then always fail,

[22:02] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: independently of actual availability of the feature.
