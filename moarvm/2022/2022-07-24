[08:17] <timo> ground breaking stuff

[08:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Kaiepi++ created pull request #1715: Replace the MVMROOTs' block argument with varargs

[08:24] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1715

[08:34] <timo> interesting. this theoretically also allows us to put multiple blocks inside MVMROOT?

[08:35] <Kaiepi> i guess? i haven't tested that way of using it

[08:40] <timo> my dream would be to still be able to step through mvmrooted blocks line by line and get proper line numbers in backtraces and such ;(

[08:49] <timo> ^- gets rid of some "const_i64 + unless_i" combinations that made it into spesh results

[08:55] <timo> have not checked if anything major now goes below the inline limit in spesh compilation, though

[09:03] <timo> ah very cool: !cursor_capture with obj, obj, str goes from 3 BBs and 452 bytes down to one BB and 418 bytes

[09:11] <timo> for some reason, in one case moar makes a lot more different candidates for that frame

[09:12] <timo> still too big to inline it looks like

[13:39] <lizmat> thanks!  was about to miss it  :-)

[13:48] <lizmat> nice landing

[13:49] <Nicholas> yes. But I have to admit that I'm mssing the 4-way screen of Falcon Heavy.

[13:49] <Nicholas> And WEN HOP?

[14:05] <lizmat> the regulators determine that to a large extent now  :-(
