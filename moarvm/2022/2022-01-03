[12:11] <gfldex> lizmat: this year, my mine starts extra salty. I'm working for a mobile carrier. Strangly, we are not getting any new complaints^Wemails from customers.

[12:12] <lizmat> ah...  using Exchange by any chance ?

[12:13] <gfldex> aye. And they can't just disable the filters or we are up to our noses in malware.

[12:14] <lizmat> fun... knowing a barrage of mails is building up  :-(

[12:15] <gfldex> We are using a custom mail client to handle customer emails, and so do all banks here in DE. There are no local malware scanners.

[12:20] *** bartolin left
[12:27] <timo> put a filter in between that sets the date back 1 year before putting it through the malware engine, and forward 1 year afterwards

[12:28] <lizmat> I'd make that more than 1 year back / forward, as I doubt this will be fixed within a year  :-)

[15:10] <MasterDuke> random time to ask this question, but does anybody have any thoughts/comments about the associated trio of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1619 + https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/752 + https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4669 ?

[15:27] <bartolin> MasterDuke: probably not that helpful, but: a while ago I looked at the changes for the jvm backend and didn't see anything suspicious. I didn't comment because the main question is probably "is that change in behaviour fine" -- and I don't know why this has been implemented the way it is.

[15:29] *** linkable6 left
[15:31] *** linkable6 joined
[15:35] <MasterDuke> bartolin: thanks. fwiw, i'm 99% certain i ran the nqp and rakudo tests with the jvm (and they passed), but i didn't do the performance measurements there

[15:38] <nine> MasterDuke: sounds sensible to me. Smaller ops is also in line with the general direction of MoarVM

[15:42] <MasterDuke> cool. will probably do the merges+bumps later this evening unless there are any objections before then

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Change nqp::radix(_I)? to return # chars converted

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: Instead of radix ** # chars converted. Most uses of the radix ops don't

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: need that value, so this saves the multiplications in the common case

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: and the uses that do need it can to the exponentiation themselves.

[21:03] <[Coke]> ^^ needs a doc update as well, I think.

[21:03] <MasterDuke> done in the nqp PR, i'm just about to add in the moarvm bump and merge it

[21:04] <[Coke]> MasterDuke++

[21:05] <[Coke]> I stupidly looked at the there, didn't see a doc update, checked in nqp checkout (hey, it's got the old docs)....

[21:05] <[Coke]> *at the PR there*

[21:05] <[Coke]> Thank you. :)

[21:05] <MasterDuke> heh, np

[21:05] <MasterDuke> glad to see someone is checking up on things

[23:42] <MasterDuke> random question, but couldn't https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/strings/utf8.c#L620-L632 just realloc the result of MVM_string_utf8_encode instead of mallocing a new larger string and memcpying into it?
