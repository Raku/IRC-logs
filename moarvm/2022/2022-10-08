[10:05] <lizmat> m: sub a(uint $b) { dd $b }; my int $b = -1;  a $b   # that'd be wrong, right ?

[10:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a51b1521: OUTPUT: «-1␤»

[10:10] <nine> I'd say so

[10:12] <lizmat> then we still haz a bug there

[10:13] <lizmat> m: sub a(uint $a) { say $a }; my int $b = -1;  a $b

[10:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a51b1521: OUTPUT: «18446744073709551615␤»

[10:14] <lizmat> aaah... the problem is in the .raku on the unsigned int

[10:24] <nine> That's the fun of working on things like unsigned support or character encoding issues. You can never be quite sure the problem isn't in your debugging aids

[10:30] <lizmat> still, I wonder where .raku on native ints actually lives: looks like Int.raku ?

[10:30] <lizmat> I mean, we can't dispatch on natives without HLLizing them, right ?

[10:32] <nine> I'm not sure what you mean

[10:32] <lizmat> my uint $a = 42; $a.raku

[15:59] <nine> Stopped sounds so finite and I sure hope that's incorrect.

[16:04] <dogbert17> I hope so too :)

[16:18] <nine> Initially I just focused on RakuAST to push that forward. But then I changed jobs and am now a professional developer again, so I can improve performance and fix bugs all day long. And at the same time I hit a snag on my RakuAST work and just can't seem to fix the issue. That doesn't exactly help with motivation.

[16:22] <dogbert17> well, there are a couple of bugs that are quite easy to repro if you're interested. Btw, what language are you using at your new job, java?

[16:29] <nine> C++ and Ruby

[16:30] <nine> With Scala and Elixir possible in the future

[16:30] <dogbert17> nice selection :)

[16:34] <nine> I'd appreciate Ruby more if Raku didn't exist :) My impression is that on the scale from Perl to Raku, Ruby is somewhere around the 20 % mark.

[16:39] <dogbert17> are you supposed to do Rails as well or is it backend stuff

[16:39] <nine> It is a rails application, but my work is pretty far in the back

[17:06] <dogbert17> interesting
