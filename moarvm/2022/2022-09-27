[17:42] <MasterDuke> ok, this really is blowing my mind
[17:44] <nine> ?
[17:44] <MasterDuke> if i add an `if (ins->info->opcode == MVM_OP_cmp_i)` in the emit.dasc implementation of cmp_(i|u), it starts returning the right operand
[17:45] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/76057f0d70c5247729b33ab095bf4e8c
[17:46] <MasterDuke> when i do that, `my uint $b = -1; say $b; use nqp; my $c; for ^100_000 -> uint $a { $c := nqp::cmp_i($b,$a) }; say $c` prints: 18446744073709551615
[17:46] <MasterDuke> o = 62, cmp_i = 62

[17:49] <MasterDuke> my implementations of the *_u ops seem correct, but cmp_i is getting messed up
[17:51] <MasterDuke> it's fine if i copy the cmp_i case into a new cmp_u case, and just hard code the different if/else branches
[17:52] <MasterDuke> does the same thing if i build with clang
[17:53] <Nicholas> for the failing version, if you run it under valgrind, does valgrind get excited?
[17:54] <MasterDuke> oh! it's fine if i put braces in the ifs/elses
[17:56] *** japhb left
[17:56] <MasterDuke> and also interesting, under valgrind but without braces it gives the right value, no complaints
[17:57] <MasterDuke> don't understand what's happening, but adding braces to the if/else bodies is a simple enough fix.
[17:57] <MasterDuke> afk&
[17:58] <Nicholas> usually if it worked under valgrind, that can mean that you forgot to zero a variable in a function
[17:58] <Nicholas> ASAN might reveal what
[17:59] <Nicholas> "works with braces" might have meant "a trailing else that you thought went with one if, but the C grammar thought went with a different if"
[17:59] <Nicholas> but that wouldn't be affected by valgrind

[20:47] <MasterDuke> no complaints from asan without braces, just the incorrect value
[20:53] <MasterDuke> huh. and if i add `if $a == 90_000 { $c := nqp::cos_n(rand) };` in the loop body as something to break on after it's been jitted, the value changes to '0', which is still different from when without the jit, but not the value of the right operand
