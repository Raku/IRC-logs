[09:15] <timo> [Coke]: i tend to like compiling moarvm with -O 0, but here the trace goes so far into the native library that perahps just getting the actual arguments passed to libssl are a good starting point? can you get the debug symbols for libssl and libcrypto?

[09:19] <timo> can you go to the last MVM_ function and ask for `call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)`?

[12:17] <[Coke]> I will try this evening, thanks for the suggestion. doubt I can easily get debug versions of the installed ports.

[12:19] <timo> ports isn't a thing that compiles stuff itself, right?

[12:21] <[Coke]> If I understand correctly, it can be binaries, but it doesn't need to be binaries. I could dig and see if I can re-install/build with debug
