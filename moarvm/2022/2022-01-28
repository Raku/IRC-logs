[09:30] <Nicholas> $1 = (MVMObject *) 0x1
[09:31] <Nicholas> This looks suspiciously similar to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1656
[09:31] <Nicholas> but I can't recreate it (yet) on a build on a machine where rr works
[10:09] <Nicholas> done so.
[10:09] <Nicholas> issues updated.
[10:09] <Nicholas> I don't think that I can take this further.

[16:31] <Nicholas> what's the best way to "hit" MVM_coerce_s_i with an NQP testcase?
[16:35] <Nicholas> m: say 6 * "7"
[16:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar dab9cd661: OUTPUT: «42␤»
[16:35] <Nicholas> aha, that seems good enough. (Yes, that's not NQP...)

[18:32] <Nicholas> that's not what we want, is it?
[18:33] <Nicholas> (I don't know how to show the same code running on the most recent release)
[18:34] <Nicholas> if it wasn't obvious - I've figured this out from code inspection. So I have an idea how to fix it.

[22:59] <MasterDuke> whoops. didn't intend that
[23:01] <MasterDuke> i was actually wondering how much of the strtoll functionality is specced, and if there was any further simplifications that could be done. guess that's one thing that isn't specced
