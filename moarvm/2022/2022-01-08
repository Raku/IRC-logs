[08:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: #include <assert.h> explicitly.

[08:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: 

[08:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: It turns out that atomic_ops.h was pulling in assert.h for us.

[08:48] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: review: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/55be3aa27f

[08:49] <Nicholas> I guess that means

[13:24] <MasterDuke> random idea of the day, would it be good to use something like https://metacpan.org/pod/TAP::Formatter::JUnit so our test runs in CI can show up nicely in the "Test" tab of azure?

[13:24] <MasterDuke> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/review-continuous-test-results-after-build?view=azure-devops#surface-test-results-in-the-tests-tab

[14:26] <nine> These build failures make me nervous: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:niner9:rakudo-git/perl6-URI/openSUSE_Factory_ARM/aarch64  https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:niner9:rakudo-git/perl6-Cro-HTTP/openSUSE_Factory_ARM/armv7l

[14:26] <nine> At least the URI one seems quite reproducible (haven't tried the other one)

[14:29] <MasterDuke> are those with master?

[14:29] <nine> Yes. But I don't know when it started. I've gotten lots of build failures since about new-disp landed but never took the time to have a closer look. Especially because I have no idea to investigate a build hang.

[14:30] <MasterDuke> can you log into the building system?

[14:32] <nine> no

[14:37] <[Coke]> getting nativecall failures on windows rakudo 'nmake test' at HEAD

[14:38] <[Coke]> looks similar to new-disp original failures that were resolved

[14:38] <[Coke]> rakudo at f77fda7d1

[14:40] <[Coke]> (test fails in nmake test, but works when run standalone)

[14:41] <[Coke]> e.g. t\04-nativecall\07-writearrier.t

[15:25] <[Coke]> yes

[15:25] <[Coke]> (I have mine configured to, anyway)

[15:33] <nine> JWST fully deployed!

[15:34] <Nicholas> you're ahead of SpaceXMasterrace on this

[15:35] <nine> Watching the NASA live stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGTem8vkB0

[15:59] <timo> is it just my machine or is that stream kinda stuttery

[16:00] <nine> same here

[16:10] <nine> Good news: looks like fix_unsigned just needs one more bootstrap, so it's 2 in total

[16:18] <MasterDuke> a friend of mine works on the jwst, took me to visit it years ago. haven't heard from him recently, i assume he's pretty busy right now

[16:20] <MasterDuke> timo: up for questions about profiling?

[17:42] <Nicholas> nine: before I forget, and I've not done my homework on this

[17:42] <Nicholas> but removing the (old) disp code means that most bytecode from 2013-mumble to "mid last year" no longer validates

[17:42] <Nicholas> so effectively all or nearly all deprecated ops can be re-used

[17:43] <Nicholas> I wasn't early enough to say "so they can be used for unsigned"
