[09:01] <nine_> I wonder for which problem would bitwise string ops be the best solution.

[09:03] <Nicholas> "bitwise operations on byte buffers" I think

[09:05] <Nicholas> I can't remember if I ever used them, or was just considering them as a solution to a problem, but using (equal length) "strings" of 0-255 gets you various efficient bitwise represtations, which was a potential solution for at least one problem

[09:05] <Nicholas> oh, that sentance needed better editing.

[09:06] <Nicholas> #moarvm, * good, *, *. ish.

[09:11] <nine_> Yeah, that sounds more like byte buffers, for which I can totally see the need for bitwise operations

[09:12] <Nicholas> but in perl 5 (and perl 4) all you have are hammers

[09:13] <Nicholas> or something like that. Desert, floor polish, characters string and byte buffer.

[12:07] *** reportable6 left
[12:17] <Nicholas> Nope, can't build:

[12:17] <Nicholas> 3rdparty/libatomicops/src/atomic_ops.h:430:5: error: #error Cannot implement AO_compare_and_swap_full on this architecture.

[12:17] <Nicholas>   430 | #   error Cannot implement AO_compare_and_swap_full on this architecture.

[12:17] <Nicholas>       |     ^~~~~

[12:18] <Nicholas> and oh my, updating submodules took a long time (and had to be edited to use ssh)

[12:19] <Nicholas> oh, mmm, I wonder if we could optionally use C11 atomics instead of libatomics API if we have the former...

[12:48] <nine_> That would be nice

[12:48] <nine_> Does MSVC support C11 atomics?

[12:51] <Nicholas> "Not enough" for the probe I created to pass. Turns out that mimalloc has #elif defined(_MSC_VER)

[12:52] <Nicholas> and a special-snowflake implementation

[16:04] <[Coke]> good moarning.

[16:05] * [Coke] wonders how hard it is to make this work in anything other than English

[16:07] <lizmat> goede moargen  :-)

[16:07] <lizmat> Gute Moargen

[16:07] <lizmat> Bon Joar  (meh)

[16:11] <[Coke]> Danke!

[16:12] <[Coke]> moarshi moarshi? . o O (Nope)

[16:51] <gfldex> In some parts of DE "Morgen" is acutally pronounced "Moargen". The "r" is almost lost tho.

[16:57] <lizmat> yeah. "mogge" is also quite common in NL  :-)   which would be close to "moagge"  :-)

[16:59] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: If both the FLAT and NAMED flags are set, this means exactly the same as

[16:59] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the FLAT_NAMED flag, so we treat them the same. Later on we can free up

[16:59] <Geth> ¦ MoarVM: the FLAT_NAMED flag. Doing this in two steps to avoid bootstrapping issues.

[17:01] <nine_> lizmat: the NQP commit already contains a bump

[17:01] <lizmat> aha!  ok

[17:01] <nine_> This is still preparatory work for the actual unsigned fixes

[17:01] <lizmat> yeah, got that  :-)

[19:44] <MasterDuke> Nicholas: many thanks for the mimalloc work. did you notice my concerns/questions about the telemeh-related changes?

[19:46] <Nicholas> yes, sorry, hadn't got to a reply on that one yet

[19:46] <MasterDuke> no worries, i just realized i made them on the old pr

[19:49] <MasterDuke> hm. i did just compile CORE.c with telemetry logging and didn't get any errors...

[19:51] <MasterDuke> which i honestly find surprising, i thought those particular changes were in fact incorrect. maybe not...
