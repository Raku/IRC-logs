[19:22] <timo> i haven't been around too much but i do appreciate seeing rakuast being pushed forward :)

[19:31] <jdv> timo: you and lembark never figured the mem leak, right?

[19:31] <jdv> my rando project still leaks:(

[19:32] <timo> i only vaguely recall the actual problem, but i think i had what i considered my kind-of final assessment

[19:33] <timo> or i guess it was about a lack of backpressure somewhere prhaps? this was about when you run a subprocess, right? and you grab its output?

[19:35] <jdv> maybe async stuff or subproc iirc

[20:27] <timo> you could use sigstop and sigcont to manage a much faster writer than your process reads

[21:26] <timo> hm, did i start a branch where i tried to implement that backpressure mechanism for async process pipes? i forgot what it was called. not allowance, something similar?

[21:40] <timo> permits?
