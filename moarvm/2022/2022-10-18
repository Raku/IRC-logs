[19:29] <lizmat> so, do we have a way to re-open STDIN when procing out?

[19:29] <lizmat> case in point:

[19:30] <lizmat> raku -e '$*IN.slurp; run "vim" < foo

[19:30] <lizmat> raku -e '$*IN.slurp; run "vim"' < foo

[19:31] <lizmat> I either get: Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal    and a delay of ~ 2 seconds and "mouse droppings" in my terminal

[19:31] <lizmat> or, if I close $*IN, I get:

[19:32] <lizmat> The spawned command 'vim' exited unsuccessfully (exit code: 1, signal: 0)

[19:32] <japhb> Well, if you are redirecting from a file, it is indeed not a terminal.

[19:33] <japhb> I suppose you could dry reopening on '/dev/tty', which should be the controlling terminal on Posix systems

[19:33] <japhb> *could try

[19:33] <lizmat> that'd be hardly portable..  :-)

[19:34] <lizmat> but it indeed does the right thing!

[19:36] <japhb> lizmat: Portable to all the platforms that matter *cough*.  ;-)

[19:36] <japhb> But seriously, it should even work under WSL2.

[19:36] <lizmat> ok, then I'll use that for now

[19:37] <lizmat> the idea being that you can:

[19:37] <lizmat> raku foo.raku 2> 2(rak --backtrace --edit)

[19:37] <lizmat> raku foo.raku 2> >(rak --backtrace --edit)

[19:38] <lizmat> to run a raku script, and then be able to edit all the source locations of the stack trace

[19:39] <japhb> ah yeah, makes sense

[19:44] <lizmat> I sorta thought nqp::getstdin would do the right thing, but it doesn't seem to

[19:47] <japhb> Well as far as its concerned, stdin is the redirect ... it's not paying attention to controlling terminal at that point.

[19:48] <japhb> (/dev/tty wasn't just a random hack -- that's apparently how you're Supposed To Do That)

[20:24] <nine> Well, /dev/tty is only correct if STDIN was connected to the terminal before. If it was a pipe or a file, you'd still be off. The correct way is to dup() the file descriptor before closing it and later dup2() it back to STDIN

[21:43] <japhb> nine: /dev/tty is, to my understanding, how you recover the controlling terminal when STDIN was connected to a pipe or file outside of your program's control.

[23:51] <MasterDuke> any thoughts on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1723 ?

[23:57] <japhb> MasterDuke: First, it's somewhat annoying how many files have to change just to replace a deprecated op with a live one.  :-P  Second, does libuv have any way to set *just one* of uid and gid, leaving the other unchanged?  Read-update-write for chown seems like a race condition ....
