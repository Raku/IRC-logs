[14:10] <MasterDuke> i don't recognize that syntax, what's it from?

[14:23] <Nicholas> I met [* TO *] in kibana, but I think that ultimately it's from Lucene

[14:25] <Voldenet> (makes sense, since kibana is using lucene)

[14:28] <MasterDuke> huh, i've used lucene a bunch, but remember that

[14:50] <MasterDuke> ugh, problems in something like that itoa change were pretty easy to debug. e.g., "123" becomes 12...off-by-one. but this remove-spesh-candidate-if-too-many-deopts rebase...

[15:07] <MasterDuke> (rr) p spesh_cand->body.jitcode

[15:07] <MasterDuke> $1 = (MVMJitCode *) 0xffffffff00000007

[15:08] <nine> That...doesn't look right

[15:08] <nine> who wrote that value?

[15:08] <MasterDuke> so that's obviously not good. but then i do `watch -l spesh_cand->body.jitcode`, and `reverse-continue`

[15:08] <MasterDuke> Old value = (MVMJitCode *) 0xffffffff00000007

[15:08] <MasterDuke> New value = (MVMJitCode *) 0x7

[15:08] <MasterDuke> 0x00007f91ff584060 in MVM_sc_set_collectable_sc (tc=0x559630c41e60, col=0x559630eb6d90, sc=0x7f91fe969d98) at src/6model/sc.h:125

[15:08] <MasterDuke> 125                 col->sc_forward_u.sc.idx    = MVM_DIRECT_SC_IDX_SENTINEL;

[15:09] <nine> Looks like a GC issue then?

[15:10] <MasterDuke> yeah. which is annoying, because i thought i'd found all those with the original version of the branch

[15:13] *** frost left
[15:14] <MasterDuke> and it's been a while since i've debugged those. missing MVMROOT perhaps?

[15:14] <nine> That or a missing MVM_ASSIGN_REF

[15:15] <nine> You may want to go back to the place where that spesh cand was created or assigned to a frame

[15:30] <MasterDuke> hm, could MVM_callstack_unwind_frame cause problems?

[15:34] <MasterDuke> hm, i thought adding spesh_cand to the MVMROOT here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blame/master/src/spesh/deopt.c#L413 might help, but that by itself didn't. afk for a bit, but maybe something to investigate further when i get back

[15:42] <nine> Well it's definitely missing there

[15:44] <nine> Or access to spesh_cand replaced with frame->spesh_cand

[21:16] <MasterDuke> nine: hm, but then i'm confused by https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/74c35679a3fba707ad695c53c28918aca30b95b5

[21:37] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[21:47] <nine> Oooh...well yes, then MVMROOT is indeed the only option. And that local variable should have gotten a comment

[21:59] <MasterDuke> i added spesh_cand to the MVMROOT (now MVMROOT2 of course), but still get the exact same error. i looked through the rest of deopt.c, but didn't notice any others obviously missing
