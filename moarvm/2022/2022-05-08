[11:18] <MasterDuke> i benchmarked our sha1 implementation against openssl and a random one that some haskell package uses. in the made up benchmark i stole from somewhere, openssl took ~0.831s, from-haskell-package took ~1.465s, and ours took ~1.556s

[11:20] <MasterDuke> however, libcrypto.a is 11mb and our libsha1.a is 58kb

[11:23] <MasterDuke> i wonder how hard it would be to just extract the required files from openssl and just build those

[11:25] <nine> Some processors (most notably Ryzens) have hardware support for SHA

[14:46] <Voldenet> newest intels (since 2018) also have sha extensions

[19:19] <japhb> I'd be shocked if there wasn't a SHA1 library that was both small and efficient -- because Git needs it.

[19:25] <MasterDuke> good idea, i'll add git's implementation to the benchmark
