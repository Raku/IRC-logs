[13:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: «It's very silent in here␤»

[14:09] <lizmat> .oO( but some people listen )

[14:09] <dogbert11> hi lizmat :)

[14:09] <lizmat> dogbert11 o/

[14:11] <dogbert11> anything interesting going on?

[14:12] <lizmat> Kaiepi is overhauling the List.STORE implementation, with quite a number of nice results

[14:12] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5062

[14:13] <lizmat> on MoarVM: I'm trying to get the courage together to implement _u variants such as gt_u, lt_u etc.

[14:15] <dogbert11> sounds scary :)

[14:16] <lizmat> yeah...

[14:16] <dogbert11> are nine, timo and MasterDuke on vacation :)

[14:19] <dogbert11> I tried to replicate the bug reported by vrurg here, https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1718, with mixed results

[14:21] <dogbert11> at first I failed to do that but as soon as I rebuilt rakudo it SEGV's consistently

[14:22] <dogbert11> my stack traces are consistent by not the same as vrurgs

[14:22] <dogbert11> for me it's always like this:

[14:23] <dogbert11> #0  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

[14:23] <dogbert11> #1  0x00007ffff78fc267 in repossess (tc=0x55555555a210, reader=0x55555e4adb20, i=1, repo_conflicts=0x55555e0cae68, type=0) at src/6model/serialization.c:2982

[14:23] <dogbert11> #2  0x00007ffff78fca8b in MVM_serialization_deserialize (tc=0x55555555a210, sc=0x55555e1e77e0, string_heap=0x5555555cd6b0, codes_static=0x555555648530, repo_conflicts=0x55555e0cae68, data=0x0)

[14:23] <dogbert11>     at src/6model/serialization.c:3162

[14:24] <dogbert11> now the following is enough for a SEGV:  MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 rakudo -e 'use LibXML::Raw'

[14:29] <lizmat> nine is either on vacation or very busy
