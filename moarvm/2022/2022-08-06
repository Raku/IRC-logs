[17:39] <timo> turning spesh log on is enough disturbance to prevent the errr, but spesh_blocking gets it back again

[18:07] *** reportable6 joined
[18:48] <timo> you'll be surprised to find that it's not the $i++ where the native int becomes the scalar

[18:48] <timo> it seems like it's actually the "" but True that asplodes

[18:49] *** Altai-man joined
[18:49] <timo> the section of code where the problem comes up is literally "sp_getlexvia_o" which retrieves a lexical from the outer of a frame that was inlined (or something?)

[18:50] <timo> and the lexical in question is $val from sub GENERATE-ROLE-FROM-VALUE($val) is implementation-detail {

[18:50] <timo> and the frame that's being inlined is the tiny `method () { $val }` in there

[18:53] <timo> that is very odd, and probably frustrated your golfing attempts
