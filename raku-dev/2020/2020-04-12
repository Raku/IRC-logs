[08:29] <patrickb> I'm trying to build NQP (and then rakudo) on the jvm backend on Linux. I keep getting `java.lang.RuntimeException: Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/jvm/stage2/NQPCORE.setting'`.

[08:29] <patrickb> Full output is here: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/588454

[08:29] <patrickb> I'm grateful for any clues on what might be wrong or how to debug this.

[08:30] <nine> patrickb: have you tried to compile it before?

[08:31] <patrickb> no, not in the last few months.

[08:31] <patrickb> and not with that checkout

[08:39] *** MasterDuke joined
[08:40] *** sena_kun joined
[08:42] *** Altai-man_ left
[08:48] <MasterDuke> the nqp jvm backend just built fine for me. however, nqp.jar was being deleted by the configure step. i usually do `perl Configure.pl <options> && make install`, but i had to first just configure, then manually do `cp ./src/vm/jvm/stage0/nqp.jar .`, then run the `make install`

[08:57] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Trying that now.

[09:03] <patrickb> No change. Same error message.

[09:49] <bartolin_> patrickb: did that happen with a fresh checkout? and what commands did you run exactly?

[09:52] <bartolin_> looking at my build script I run 'perl Configure.pl --backends=jvm --gen-nqp && make all'. That worked that last time I looked (a couple of dasy ago.) Also, the commands used for Travis seem to work.

[09:57] <lizmat> Files=1306, Tests=111230, 213 wallclock secs (28.98 usr  8.36 sys + 3012.02 cusr 270.85 csys = 3320.21 CPU)

[10:24] <patrickb> bartolin_: Trying with a fresh checkout now. First it errors with: `cp: cannot stat 'nqp.jar': No such file or directory` which is a bug I already have a patch for locally (it's just a missing make target dependency). The build with that fix applied is currently in progress.

[10:24] <lizmat> looks like the 2020.02.1 zip in WIn does not work: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/issues/38

[10:27] <patrickb> lizmat: I'll have a look.

[10:30] <patrickb> bartolin_: It errors out with the exact same error message as before. So a fresh checkout doesn't help. Next try: fresh fedora installation

[10:40] <bartolin_> patrickb: very strange. I could take a look later.

[12:00] <nine> an hour well spent :)

[12:03] <AlexDaniel> yeah, enjoying it now, jnthn++ always does amazing talks :)

[12:13] <Xliff> jnthn: PAST, QAST, RakuAST? 

[12:13] <Xliff> jnthn: Why not RAST?

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> because it's more explicit

[12:14] <Xliff> Then why not spell out the other two?

[12:14] <AlexDaniel> because it's a mistake of the past and it no longer matters :)

[12:14] <Xliff> You suck all of the fun out of my life, AlexDaniel....

[12:14] <Xliff> :P

[12:15] <Xliff> BTW - What's left on the PR?

[12:15] <AlexDaniel> maybe, but at least we won't have to document “What does RAST abbreviation stand for?” in the docs :P

[12:17] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: BTW - What's left on the Blin PR?

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: don't touch @sorted-modules, remove unused $bisected variable, remove ` around SHAs, 

[12:18] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: preferably indent with 4 spaces just like the rest of the code, squash your commits, and I'll merge it :)

[12:18] <Xliff> You seriously don't like the @sorted-modules thing? 

[12:18] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: also don't .substr the SHAs, I just remember that it can be a list of commits. Just stringify it as is

[12:18] <Xliff> Explain that to me.

[12:19] <AlexDaniel>  } Bisected: `{ .bisected.substr(0, 8) }`

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> this needs to be just

[12:19] <AlexDaniel>  } Bisected: { .bisected }

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> as it can be a list of multiple SHAs (when the result of bisection is multiple commits)

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> github will automatically show short versions, it's fine

[12:20] <Xliff> Got that.

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: as to sorted-modules, we need to sort by .bisected first and then by module name

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> as that'd produce the most useful list (with all modules that were broken by the same commit grouped together)

[12:21] <Xliff> Ah.

[12:22] <AlexDaniel> so it's different sorting method when compared to the overview file which is just a dump of the current progress

[12:25] <AlexDaniel> The PR will probably end up with a relatively small diff, but it is extremely valuable for release management

[12:25] <AlexDaniel> you don't always need a lot of code :)

[12:38] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Done

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, sounds good

[15:58] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, not really, I guess, you need to git pull and build a docker image to use then.
