[22:15] <AlexDaniel> so I already slept on it but I still don't know if there's any way to make it significantly shorter or something

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> it's better than the default thing we had before, and it's much more useful

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> I like it, but… 12 messages?

[22:18] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: ↑ maybe you have some cool thoughts

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> oh, one good idea is to reverse the order so that you get the most recent change first

[22:20] <MasterDuke> huh, interesting

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> done

[22:20] <MasterDuke> do we need to worry much? most changes won't have that many messages, right?

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> bisectable6test: say rand

[22:21] <bisectable6test> AlexDaniel, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[22:21] <bisectable6test> AlexDaniel, More than 4 changes to bisect, please try a narrower range like old=2020.02.1 new=HEAD

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: so it's pretty much limited to 15 messages

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> yeah, well, I guess we should just try it. If it works then it's more useful than annoying, and we can think how to make it produce less spam later
