[16:25] <vrurg> dumarchie: I just have realized that I missed your review request on that.

[16:34] <leont> I think I'm going to have to give up on ARGS-TO-CAPTURE, and go all RUN-MAIN. I just can't use GENERATE-USAGE the way I need to :-/

[16:34] *** dumarchie left
[16:35] <lizmat> leont: could you explain in a gist what's wrong / making it impossible for you ?

[16:36] <leont> It's assuming ARGS-TO-CAPTURE will always succeed at generating a Capture, and only matching that capture to a sub can fail.

[16:37] <leont> Such a blind parse is exactly how the built-in parser works, but not how a parser with pre-defined options works.

[16:37] <lizmat> do you see a solution to that ?

[16:49] <leont> Not really within the framework of ARGS-TO-CAPTURE and GENERATE-USAGE.

[16:49] <leont> Currently on error I print a message and call &*EXIT(2), but that has its own limitations.

[16:53] *** finsternis left
[16:57] <leont> This works, until I want to add my own usage message. At that point I have to essentially reimplement RUN-MAIN in ARGS-TO-CAPTURE anyway, so I might as well implement the latter

[16:59] <leont> Because the only way to get information from ARGS-TO-CAPTURE to GENERATE-USAGE is via a capture that will first be matched against the MAIN

[21:56] <lizmat> that makes the class variable $first-repo-id set to whatever was the first repo in $*REPO at that time

[21:56] <lizmat> that feels... wrong, would that still be correct after a "use lib" ?

[23:12] <sena_kun> ok, I am not just good enough for this... it seems somehow "#if (defined(RTLD_DI_LINKMAP) || defined(OS_SunOS)) && !defined(DL_USE_GLIBC_ITER_PHDR)" evaluates to true on alpine (musl?) and not on "normal" distros.

[23:12] <sena_kun> musl indeed defines it: https://github.com/ifduyue/musl/blob/master/include/dlfcn.h#L20 while not providing RTLD_SELF

[23:12] <sena_kun> I am not sure if it's musl who doesn't provide what's expected by dyncall or it's dyncall uses something not provided.

[23:28] <sena_kun> anybody around?

[23:35] <leont> Looks like something in the middle to me

[23:36] * Altai-man_ sent a bug report to dyncall maintainer with detailed explanation of where things go very wrong, hope for answer this Monday. :S
