[21:13] <nine> vrurg: looks like much of our ecosystem depends on our failure to make module loading really lexical. I.e. use Zef; use Zef::Client; and magically you get a Zef::Distribution available as well.

[21:14] <nine> My replacement for globals merging accidentally fixes this bug, but trips up all dists I try :/

[21:17] <vrurg> nine: Too bad. Because this may have side effects if I declare a `my class Zef::MyOwnSomething { }` – and Zef gets it into its namespace to. And if it already has something named same way – ...

[21:19] <vrurg> Ok, if it's my code – I can do something about it. But what if two modules clash?? I see no solution to it whatsoever.

[21:20] <vrurg> I'd say it's better to get some bravery and take care of the failing modules than preserve such a huge pitfall.

[21:21] <nwc10> we can't change from tabs to spaces in makefiles because there are too many users

[21:21] <nwc10> (ish)

[21:27] <nine> Wenn in this non-representative sample we're talking about 80 % of modules

[21:27] <nine> And IO::Socket::Async::SSL's failure mode caused by a missing use statement was a straight segfault

[21:28] <nwc10> fxing this will be easier than trying to get all of CPAN to run with `use strict` enabled by default

[21:29] <nine> Well, I'll still have a look at how to re-create the bug in my implementation. Once I got that I'm pretty sure we can make it language version dependent.

[21:36] <nine> The good news is that I've made it far enough to actually try multiple distributions ;)
