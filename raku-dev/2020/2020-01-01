[00:02] <AlexDaniel> I mean, even RT says that it's John Harrison

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78068

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> From: 	John Harrison <ash.gti [...] gmail.com>

[00:05] <AlexDaniel> toddr: found them: https://github.com/ashgti

[00:07] <AlexDaniel> ah, lol, I missed your message :D

[00:07] <AlexDaniel> nvm then :D

[00:10] <toddr> ok updated. Honestly The list I have is pretty good. I've got 672 mappings.

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> toddr: 128 is https://github.com/geekosaur

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> chromatic is https://github.com/chromatic

[00:13] <toddr> ok. 128 is the number of cases he interacted with.

[00:21] <AlexDaniel> jason switzer is https://github.com/s1n

[00:22] <AlexDaniel> Dan Zwell (dan@zwell.net) is https://github.com/lefth

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> geez can't find a github account of Parrot Raiser

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> maybe they don't have one

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> I don't recognize any of the remaining names but there are some prominent people there, like Tim Nelson

[00:30] <AlexDaniel> Mark J. Reed is https://github.com/markjreed

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> Stephen Simmons and stifynsemons is https://github.com/stifynsemons

[00:34] <AlexDaniel> quester is https://github.com/quester

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> that's as much as I can do today :)

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> good night everyone and happy new year!

[01:10] <toddr> Oh BTW AlexDaniel You can see what the conversion will look like here: 

[01:10] <toddr> https://github.com/Raku/p6rt/issues/17

[01:11] <toddr> oops, look at one above 20 if you want to see the right link

[01:11] <toddr> https://github.com/Raku/p6rt/issues/27

[01:11] <toddr> I need to fix one of the big bugs in the perl5 conversion before I do the run

[01:16] <toddr> thanks for the help

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> toddr: what about labels?

[07:32] <AlexDaniel> toddr: as I mentioned previously, here you can see how many open tickets each label had: https://web.archive.org/web/20181121184441/https://fail.rakudo.party/

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> you can perhaps ignore most of them but the ones that have more than 10 tickets are relatively useful

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> (ignore MOLD, it's an autogenerated label)

[12:58] <AlexDaniel> ah, I'm blind, there *is* a way to invite through the API

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> “To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization invitations per 24 hour period”

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> alright

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> will take a freaking week to do it

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> but I have a script now

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> it works \o/

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> first 45 invitations sent!

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> weekly: AlexDaniel started sending out invitations to the new Raku github organization (https://github.com/Raku). If you were a member of perl6 organization you probably received an invitation during the last week, but if not, please let us know!

[14:04] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted! (weekly)

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> things I hate with passion: pagination and rate limiting :)

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> github allows up to 100 members listed per page, and just beacuse we need 4 times that I had to add a few lines of code :P

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> what else can I fix for this shiny new year :)

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> ooooh let's redirect IRC channels

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> ALSO: Please don't move your repos to /Raku yet! Let people accept the invites, without that assignments and other stuff may be lost!

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> you can create new repos there but please don't transfer just yet

[14:40] <AlexDaniel> moritz: can I have founder privs on #perl6 and #perl6-dev ?

[15:40] <moritz> AlexDaniel: I honestly don't know

[15:40] <moritz> AlexDaniel: if you tell me some magic incantation that gives you these privs, I'll happily do it

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> moritz: /msg ChanServ FLAGS #raku-dev AlexDaniel +F

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> if I'm not mistaken

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> moritz: ok, first of all I meant #perl6-dev

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> but it turns out you don't have +F on #perl6-dev, but you do on #perl6

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> and jnthn doesn't have it on #perl6 but does on #perl6-dev :)

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> wonderful :)

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> moritz: let me know if it works for #perl6

[15:44] <moritz> 16:44 -ChanServ(ChanServ@services.)- Flags +Ff were set on AlexDaniel in #perl6.

[15:45] <moritz> AlexDaniel: let me know if it works for you :D

[15:45] <AlexDaniel> moritz: I see it now! Yes, thank you!

[15:46] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: if you can do the same for #perl6-dev that'd be awesome /msg ChanServ FLAGS #perl6-dev AlexDaniel +F

[15:47] <AlexDaniel> (TL;DR I'm trying to set redirects)

[17:53] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: It failed with "Only 4 founders allowed per channel".

[18:03] <moritz> AlexDaniel: if you figure out the magic redirect formula, maybe document it for one of the founders

[21:42] <lizmat> so I looked at moving the lib/modules to the .rakumod extension

[21:42] <lizmat> basically git mv NativeCall.pm6 -> NativeCall.rakumod

[21:42] <lizmat> then tools/build/install-core-dist.p6 needed a change

[21:43] <lizmat> and t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t needed a change 

[21:43] <lizmat> however, t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t still fails badly

[21:43] <lizmat> hmmm... and now it succeeds ?

[21:43] <lizmat> hmmm

[21:46] <lizmat> ok, the first time doing make t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t, it fails

[21:46] <lizmat> the second time it succeeds

[21:46] <lizmat> then, when I run raku t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t

[21:46] <lizmat> it fails the first time, and the second time succeeds

[21:48] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/0d9872224e2ae9832895027d472c0fb3

[21:48] <lizmat> nine: any suggestions?  ^^

[22:08] <nine> lizmat: not right now, no

[22:09] <nine> The test uses NativeCall.pm6 only as a moderately large module with dependencies that's readily available
