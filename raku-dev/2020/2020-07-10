[00:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fix handling of generics in TypedArray.raku

[00:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[00:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Using TValue directly can lead to an attempt to call .raku on an

[00:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: uninstantiated generic. Just use the type name of self instead of

[00:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: building it with "Array" and TValue.

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fix handling of generics in TypedArray.raku

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: When calling .raku on a generic typed array, it's possible for the

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: method to wind up calling .raku on an uninstantiated generic. Instead of

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: using the typed array's parameter directly, use the type of the array's

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: container descriptor (which should get instantiated eventually).

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fixes #3784

[07:19] <nine> So, I now got a full -ll-exception backtrace of "push_o requires a concrete object (got a ThreadPoolScheduler::Queue type object instead)": https://gist.github.com/niner/c2a72bd474a8e46ad6256d5c8844c7ae

[07:19] <nine> Alas it's still a mystery :/

[07:22] <nine> $!scheduler.cue(nqp::shift($!thens), :catch(nqp::shift($!thens))) tries to nqp::push(self!general-queue, wrap-catch(&code, &catch)) but somehow self!general-queue returns a type object instead of the queue.

[07:25] <nine> I don't see how that's possible. !general-queue does check if the queue is concrete and if not binds an nqp::create(Queue) before returning $!general-queue

[20:13] <patrickb> I have just made the version numbers displayed on the Star Bundle page on rakudo.org dynamic. Previously they were hard coded and caused grief because they turn stale easily. Now that shouldn't happen anymore.

[20:14] <patrickb> I pushed the change to repo. Not sure if there is some auto-update-from-repo magic deployed.

[20:21] <vrurg_> .ask lizmat Have your received my PM? There were few splits afterwards...

[20:21] <tellable6> vrurg_, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[20:22] <lizmat> vrurg_: yes I did

[20:22] <vrurg_> Ok, I was somewhat worried. :)

[20:22] <lizmat> did you see my reply just now ?

[20:22] <lizmat> in privmsg ?

[20:22] <vrurg_> No. I'm migrating back to my repaired macbook, restarting once in a while.
