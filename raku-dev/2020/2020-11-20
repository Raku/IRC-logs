[21:29] <nwc10> good *, #raku-dev

[21:30] <nwc10> If we wanted Geth_ to announce MoarVM issues too (not just PRs) to #moarvm, who would we ask?

[21:30] <MasterDuke> tyil++ or issue/pr at https://github.com/Raku/geth i assume

[21:31] <tyil> I don't think issues are implemented in Geth right now, so that'd have to be added to it

[21:32] <lizmat> some bot has implemented pushing issues to IRC channels, as the problem-solving repo does that ?

[21:32] <nwc10> so I should create a problem-solving issue "test please ignore" and then see which bot announces it? :-)

[21:34] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Raku/geth/blob/master/lib/Geth/GitHub/Hooks.pm6#L17 looks like it does support them

[21:34] <MasterDuke> though the geth code in general is a bit outdated, lots of references to github.com/perl6/ and such

[21:35] <tyil> and it occasionally falls over too :<

[21:35] <tyil> nwc10: can you check which events are being sent to Geth through the webhook right now?

[21:35] <tyil> perhaps it's just as simple as checking a box :>

[21:36] <nwc10> um, "no", because *I* don't know enough about github to even know where to look

[21:37] <tyil> you can extend the request to someone else that does know, it should be easy enough to test
