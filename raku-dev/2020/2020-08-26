[18:42] <lizmat> Altai-man: hhmmm.. we probably don't want to have the libuv update make it to the release

[18:56] <Altai-man> lizmat, oh, was it bumped?

[18:58] <Altai-man> lizmat, I don't think that's a problem. I will take 2020.08.1, cherry-pick nqp commit, cherry-pick rakudo commits, bump versions.

[18:58] <Altai-man> nwc10, 2020.08.2 of rakudo. No, moarvm is good, merge what's fun. :)

[19:00] <lizmat> Altai-man: yeah, it was, by me earlier today

[19:00] <Altai-man> lizmat, well, given we have a separate branch, it won't be a problem, I think.

[19:01] <lizmat> yeah, don't think so either... just wanted to make sure that you knew

[19:01] <Altai-man> Well, we will have duplicate commits in master after merging, but we have those already and a couple more won't hurt.

[19:01] <Altai-man> The thing is, --show-config broken breaks Comma and we don't want that.

[19:01] <Altai-man> I guess.
