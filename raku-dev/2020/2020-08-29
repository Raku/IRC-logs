[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: Allow for more parallelism when precompiling modules

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: 

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: Instead of locking the whole precomp store whenever we precompile a

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: module or re-check dependencies, we now use one lock file per target file.

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: With this multiple processes may precompile different files and store

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: them in the same precomp store.

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: 

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: Note: it would be even better to not need those .lock files at all and

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: instead lock the target files. But that caused weird issues with

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: multiple processes being able to lock the same file simultaneously. So

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: I'm leaving this next step for a future change.

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: Check for circular module loading earlier to avoid deadlock

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: 

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: Since precomp processes now take care of their own locking we have to

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: take that into account and check for circular loading before trying to

[11:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/precomp_store_parallelism: lock a destination that's potentially already locked by a parent process.

[14:45] <tbrowder> hi, jnthn, i'm making progress with cro except for ssl dependencies

[14:47] <tbrowder> ssl modules can't find libssl.so in a non-standard place

[14:48] <tbrowder> that's at least two modules so i'm not sure where to file the issue, maybe nativecall

[15:06] <tbrowder> erg, never mind, false alarm. as a workaround i've installed the package  libssl-dev which is not ideal (since i prefer to use latest openssl) but it works.
