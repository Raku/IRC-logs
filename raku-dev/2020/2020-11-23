[07:57] <sena_kun> Can you please create a ticket for the regression, stating what you discovered?

[07:57] <sena_kun> I think it's a blocker for next release, assigned to vrurg.

[08:13] *** sena_kun left
[09:10] <MasterDuke> sure

[09:15] <Xliff> MasterDuke: What regression is this?

[09:15] <MasterDuke> a performance regression

[09:17] <MasterDuke> after vrurg++'s new coercion work, inlining is broken in some cases, and since that's a really big win for moarvm optimization, there have been some slowdowns seen

[09:18] <Xliff> Ah.

[09:18] <Xliff> Thanks for the explanation.

[09:19] <MasterDuke> np

[09:19] <Xliff> Was this regression in v2020.11-23-g551b67957?

[09:20] <Xliff> Hmmm... definitely seeing higher compile times from 11/16 to now

[09:20] <MasterDuke> oh, but yeah, it's still present in rakudo

[09:21] <Xliff> Interesting I didn't see it last week....

[09:22] <MasterDuke> i haven't noticed any *new* slowdown in the past week, but i wasn't looking that closely

[09:23] <Xliff> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Po4QXSYFodBC4P6Z10c6GY2CGbCKCcsz/view?usp=sharing

[09:24] <Xliff> See "Regular Timings" sheet

[09:25] <MasterDuke> huh. so it got faster between 11/9 and 11/16, but then slower again

[09:25] <Xliff> Yup

[11:12] <AlexDaniel`> didn't use the bot? https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2020-11-23#l74

[11:12] <AlexDaniel`> yes, arguable the bot could've caught that :)

[11:12] <AlexDaniel`> arguably*

[11:12] <Altai-man> lizmat, can I PM?

[11:29] *** leont joined
[12:01] *** moray joined
[12:02] <Xliff> Actually, didn't want to be rude and use the bot.

[12:03] <Xliff> If that's the preferred way, will do so from now on.

[12:11] *** sena_kun joined
[12:13] *** Altai-man left
[12:28] <lizmat> Xliff: yes, please, that makes life easier for me...   and wouldn't be rude at all

[12:28] <lizmat> still no guarantee it will be in the weekly, though  :-)

[12:29] <Xliff> What are the requirements? I've been writing gists for years.

[12:29] <Xliff> And I thought that little script might be a bit useful.

[12:29] <lizmat> well,  a gist is just that: a gist, a fleeting moment in time, a fleet almost :-)

[12:30] <lizmat> we don't have a place to store useful scripts

[12:30] <lizmat> we do have a place to store useful code packaged in modules, though  :-)

[12:31] <Xliff> lizmat: You could say the same for "comments about raku", yet those are included.

[12:32] <lizmat> the URLs for the comments most likely will continue to work for many years to come

[12:32] <Xliff> I use gists as my sort-of code blog.

[12:32] <lizmat> the URLs to gists are...  not so stable ?

[12:32] <Xliff> No. They are stable.

[12:32] <Xliff> I have yet to have a gist change URL for years.

[12:32] <lizmat> they won't be removed after X months ?

[12:34] <Xliff> No.

[12:34] <MasterDuke> nope, i have some from 5 years ago still accessible

[12:34] <Xliff> I have gists going back 5 years

[12:34] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/2907106c84e9eb14d4c0

[12:34] <lizmat> ok, I was living under the impression that they would be removed...

[12:35] <lizmat> Ah... maybe I'm confusing it with anonymous gists.... which we don't have anymore, right ?

[12:35] <Xliff> There's a wealth of gist posts I've made there.

[12:35] <Xliff> All about Raku

[12:39] <lizmat> Xliff: so a section New Useful Code Examples in the weekly maybe ? 

[12:39] <Xliff> Sure!

[12:39] <lizmat> just before the "New Modules" section ?

[12:40] <Xliff> I might even be a regular contributor to that.

[12:40] <Xliff> s/be/become/

[12:42] * lizmat left a commment :-)

[12:43] <lizmat> ok, would be nice if there would be more than a single gist to kick off....   :-)

[12:43] <lizmat> nudge nudge  wink wink

[12:45] <lizmat> I'll be afk for a few hours, will be picking up on the RWN after that

[16:14] <[Coke]> nine: what does that opcode do? (seems very niche?)

[16:15] <[Coke]> (nqp::setdebugtypename($type, 'Curried ' ~ $curried_role.HOW.name($curried_role));)

[16:19] <MasterDuke> nine: checked out raku-Physics-Measure, raku-Physics-Unit, and raku-Physics-UnitAffix. in raku-Physics-UnitAffix, run `raku -I ../raku-Physics-Measure/lib -I ../raku-Physics-Unit/lib -I lib -e 'use Physics::Measure; use Physics::UnitAffixQ; my $l = 1nm; say ~$l;'`

[16:20] <MasterDuke> s/checkout out/cloned from [email@hidden.address]
[16:28] <nine> [Coke]: it sets the debug_name field on the STable (the MoarVM internal low level representation of a type). That's a C string that's really just there for debugging, i.e. being able to find out somewhat easily what type an object is when you're in gdb or the Raku debugger. Oh, and for error messages.

[16:30] <nine> MasterDuke: I only ever see "No such symbol 'Physics::Measure::Length'"
