[17:52] <Altai-man_> lizmat, it isn't, and Blin seems to stuck on 666 modules anyway (ha-ha), so I likely have to re-run it anyway.

[17:52] <Altai-man_> not sure about regressions yet

[17:52] <lizmat> *phew*

[17:53] <Altai-man_> lizmat, we still might discover some issues...

[17:57] <Altai-man_> lizmat, I guess PERL6_EXCEPTIONS_HANDLER is no longer deprecated...

[17:57] <lizmat> indeed, that got reverted by nine 

[17:57] <Altai-man_> ok, removing a note about that...

[17:58] <nine> Yeah, can't deprecate that when it's part of the 6.d spec tests

[17:58] <nine> Also the deprecation notice actually broke things :)

[17:58] <lizmat> but that also reverted support for RAKUDO_EXCEPTIONS_HANDLER?

[17:58] <nine> it did?

[17:59] <lizmat> ah no,

[17:59] <lizmat> it's RAKU_EXCEPTIONS_HANDLER

[18:00] <Altai-man_> so we are introducing a new alternative without deprecation?

[18:02] <lizmat> we're going to deprecate it in 6.e, right nine ?

[18:03] <lizmat> and then by adding the message to the JSON, I guess

[18:03] <nine> Something along those lines I guess

[18:51] <Altai-man_> then we can patch changelog...
