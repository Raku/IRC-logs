[09:27] <lizmat> .oO( uh oh, what did I break? )

[09:27] <Altai-man_> lizmat, I know Saturday is not the best day, but can I request more playing with IO::Path.dir?

[09:27] <Altai-man_> It seems https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/484f07443ea146a49f9fd34d1a5e5fb8a969e89f breaks File::Copy module.

[09:28] <lizmat> will look at it now

[09:28] <Altai-man_> I am not sure if revert is wise, because that apparently fixed something else. :S

[09:28] <Altai-man_> Thank you!

[09:28] <lizmat> Altai-man_: the commit fixed a number of cases AlexDaniel pointed out, that weren't tested before

[09:29] <lizmat> but which now have tests, so reverting does not appear to be an option

[09:29] <Altai-man_> lizmat, https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/9f3ebc60b4dbf894c3eba49aecb584df <- is the log.

[09:32] * Altai-man_ tries it out locally

[09:36] <lizmat> the tests are using dirs in the form: ./t/foo, which now get cleaned up to t/foo

[09:38] <Altai-man_> Can we help it or?

[09:39] <lizmat> looking at it now

[09:40] <lizmat> looks like the test gets the original IO paths, not the destination IO Paths

[09:49] <lizmat> ok, I think I see what the problem is

[09:50] <lizmat> the test calls "strip-dir", which uses the uncleaned version of the dir

[10:22] * Altai-man_ stops blin

[10:24] <AlexDaniel`> technically both are valid paths, but it was working differently before…

[10:25] <lizmat> 484f07443ea146a49f9fd34d1a5e5fb8a969e89f changed semantics to accommodate the "dirty" paths that AlexDaniel` had found

[10:25] <lizmat> I've reverted that

[10:25] *** JJMerelo joined
[10:25] <lizmat> we need to discuss options here *after* the release

[10:26] <lizmat> the behaviour of accepting dirty paths for dir seems to be what module authors expect

[10:26] <lizmat> if they want clean dirs, they should call .cleanup themselves

[10:27] <lizmat> aka "./foo".IO.cleanup.dir

[10:27] <AlexDaniel`> why did it change?

[10:28] <lizmat> why did what change ?

[10:28] <AlexDaniel`> the behavior

[10:28] <AlexDaniel`> compared to the last release

[10:29] <lizmat> the timeline is like this, to my recollection:

[10:29] <lizmat> 1. /me makes dir a lot faster

[10:30] <lizmat> 2. blin finds it breaks IO::Glob

[10:30] <lizmat> 3. turns out the speedup was caused by dirs of / not being handled correctly

[10:30] <lizmat> 4. /me fixes that

[10:31] <lizmat> 5. AlexDaniel points out that other paths such as "///" and "foo/../bar" do not produce clean results

[10:31] <lizmat> 6. /me adds a .cleanup internally to make that clean

[10:31] <lizmat> 7 /me adds tests for that

[10:31] <lizmat> 8. 7blin finds that it breaks IO::Copy

[10:32] <lizmat> 9. /me reverts additional .cleanup call internally

[10:32] <lizmat> 10. /me reverts tests for dirty paths

[10:32] <lizmat> so we're back at 4.

[10:33] <AlexDaniel`> and we're back to (5) with me pointing out that the behavior changed compared to the last release

[10:33] <lizmat> but did it ?

[10:33] <Altai-man_> It did.

[10:49] <lizmat> ok, I can see how /. is incorrect

[10:49] <lizmat> however, I don't think that /usr//local is a problem that dir() should fix

[10:49] <lizmat> or /usr/./local for that matter

[10:50] <lizmat> I think that's a case of garbage in / out

[10:50] <lizmat> if you don't want garbage, cleanup your IO::Path with .cleanup

[10:51] <Altai-man_> lizmat, can we get back to 2020.05 way of things?

[11:00] <lizmat> so should: "./foo".IO.dir produce "./foo/bar" or "foo/bar" ?

[11:00] <lizmat> sena_kun AlexDaniel` ^^

[11:01] <sena_kun> 2020.05 produced "./foo/bar".

[11:01] <MasterDuke> anything that touches filesytems, filenames, etc. is fraught with complications/complexity. i think there was good reason zoffix did that big chunk of work as a grant

[11:01] <lizmat> that is not the answer

[11:02] <lizmat> and gave the grant back in the end, no ?  MasterDuke  

[11:02] <lizmat> and that's also spent about 3 months of my life on a newio branch

[11:02] <MasterDuke> hm. wasn't that the Rat grant?

[11:02] <lizmat> that got flushed

[11:03] <lizmat> ah, could be

[11:03] <sena_kun> lizmat, we want to be compatible with existing code and avoid visible changes for the user, so I would say `./foo/bar` is the answer.

[11:03] <sena_kun> But yes, this is a complex matter.

[11:04] <MasterDuke> http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2017/05/completion-report-perl-6-io-tpf-grant.html

[11:04] <AlexDaniel`> lizmat: I think it is the answer. Both are valid paths but someone can have an `is $path, ‘…’` test in their code and you'd be breaking it

[11:04] <lizmat> well, that is what broke File::Copy's testing

[11:06] <AlexDaniel`> not sure I understand? File::Copy's tests were working fine on 2020.05 ?

[11:08] <lizmat> yes

[11:09] <lizmat> adding the .cleanup broke them

[11:21] <lizmat> yeah, *that* is clear

[11:21] <lizmat> so to fix that, I added a .cleanup internally to clean up the path for which to create a dir

[11:21] <lizmat> and *that* broke IO::Copy

[11:22] <lizmat> I have a fix for trailing /.

[11:22] <sena_kun> I think the trailing `/.` is the main issue we can spot, no?

[11:23] <lizmat> no, because apparently "foo/../bar/  should also produce "bar/baz" and not "foo/../bar/baz" ?

[11:23] <sena_kun> I don't think so.

[11:24] <sena_kun> For me on 2020.05 running `'Work/../Work'.IO.dir` returns paths like `"Work/../Work/foo".IO`.

[11:29] <sena_kun> I see.

[11:30] <lizmat> or we should decide we *do* want .cleanup, just not for the "./" in ./"foo" case

[11:30] <sena_kun> So people relied on partial cleaning we did before. Now we can either have full cleaning, which breaks, or bent backwards horribly to fix some cases.

[11:32] <sena_kun> lizmat, I would say let's release with 0 ecosystem breakage for now and specify the situation in changelog special notes. Then we can do a full cleanup in next release and make it breaking, patch modules etc.

[11:32] <lizmat> that's a thought: or we could just not allow IO::Path's to be created that are dirty

[11:33] <lizmat> but the checks for that would come at a significant performance price

[11:33] <lizmat> which is why I think we shouldn't be cleaning up paths involuntarily at all

[11:33] <lizmat> and adding .cleanup internally to dir() was a mistake

[12:05] *** Xliff joined

[12:45] *** lichtkind joined
[12:49] <ShimmerFairy> In general, I would say you should only do as much automatic cleaning as is necessary to make doing IO stuff not a nightmare. As long Raku can traverse directories and open files, you shouldn't clean things up by default if you don't have to.

[12:50] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: so should "foo/." produce "foo/bar" or "foo/./bar" in that case ?

[12:52] <ShimmerFairy> foo/./bar unless it costs nothing to simplify that, or your IO implementation for whatever reason chokes on that path string. I personally am fine with doing a  $path.cleanup.Str whenever I want a "display path", but I can understand other people not being happy with that.

[12:53] <ShimmerFairy> (maybe string-ifying a path can call cleanup() internally so that people always see a nice path outside of an IO object)

[12:59] <lizmat> but it isn't  :-(

[13:00] <ShimmerFairy> Yeah, it's worth noting that I'm talking about a perfect world where you don't care about backward compatibility, or where you can safely chuck changes behind a 'use v6.e'

[13:01] <ShimmerFairy> In general, I think ideally IO shouldn't simplify paths unless either a) the user calls .cleanup() or whatever it's actually called, or b) the user wants to stringify the object in some way (e.g. $path.Str or $path.gist causing a cleanup to happen and then be cached)

[18:56] <sena_kun> Anyone who can help a lot by spending some time proofreading (and fixing grammar) the changelog?

[18:57] <lizmat> I never remember the URL of the draft change log

[19:01] <MasterDuke> sena_kun++

[19:04] <lizmat> sena_kun: c0b5fb28 is from Nov ?

[19:05] <lizmat> and it's the *output" that's simpler ?

[19:07] <lizmat> sena_kun: re 077300c5 I would add "when splitting using a regex"

[19:07] <linkable6> (2020-06-15) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/077300c56c Make sure push-all doesn't push when exhausted

[19:13] <sena_kun> lizmat, it is, but it was merged only for this release.

[19:13] <sena_kun> I mean, we don't immediately merge all PRs, so sometimes commits from Nov are in Jun. :)

[19:14] <sena_kun> lizmat, anything else?

[19:15] <lizmat> perhaps mention ".raku" for c0b5fb28 , mentioning .perl there now is confusing

[19:15] <linkable6> (2019-11-05) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c0b5fb282c Make Instant.perl a bit less noisy

[19:16] <sena_kun> lizmat, fixed

[19:16] <lizmat> sena_kun: why isn't b63976a8f1 mentioned?

[19:16] <linkable6> (2020-05-21) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b63976a8f1 Make IO::Path.dir between 1.5x and 2.2x as fast

[19:17] <lizmat> because that was the previous release ?

[19:17] <sena_kun> lizmat, erm, it is.

[19:17] <sena_kun> Make IO::Path.dir between 1.5x and 2.2x as fast [b63976a8][6b22c1eb][7691742a][9b9d9f64]

[19:18] <lizmat> he... so we didn't notice any issues with that in the previous release

[19:18] <lizmat> odd

[19:18] <lizmat> ah

[19:18] <lizmat> ok, misunderstood

[19:18] <sena_kun> lizmat, no, it wasn't in the previous release

[19:19] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe mention 700b7432 together with b63976a8f1

[19:19] <linkable6> (2020-05-24) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/700b74329d Make dir() about 15% faster

[19:19] <linkable6> (2020-05-21) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b63976a8f1 Make IO::Path.dir between 1.5x and 2.2x as fast

[19:19] <lizmat> as the 1.5x to 2.2x *also* applies to "dir"

[19:19] <lizmat> it's just that the sub version has become 15% faster *on top* of that

[19:20] <sena_kun> I was not bothered enough to calculate^A^K Hmm.

[19:21] <lizmat> hehe... 

[19:21] <lizmat> then just put the "dir" one *after* the IO::Path.dir one

[19:21] <sena_kun> done

[19:22] <lizmat> that's it from me

[19:22] <sena_kun> lizmat, thanks!
