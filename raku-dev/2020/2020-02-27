[08:42] <lizmat> ok, I'm now 100%ish sure that the MoarVM bump is responsible for not being able to install any more modules

[08:42] <lizmat> 1. nuke install

[08:42] <lizmat> 2. Configure with bump and build

[08:42] <lizmat> 3. re-install zef

[08:42] <lizmat> 4. try to install Text::CSV: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/9a8d5929b19bda12b801d56e2a17a000

[09:52] <lizmat> with a bumped system now, I get spectest errors that only occur with "make", not when running the test directly with raku

[09:55] <jnthn> make test / make spectest were clean for me, fwiw, and had less problems under spesh stressing than before

[09:56] <lizmat> it's very confusing... but at least make spectest / test are clean for me now *before* the bump

[09:57] <jnthn> I've just pulled Rakudo HEAD so will run a test with that

[09:57] <jnthn> But you've sent me a stack trace that has precomp store at the top, and my pull has a 220 line diff in that, so... :)

[09:59] <lizmat> but installing with zef fails :-(

[09:59] <lizmat> ok, going to revert more of my work of the past days

[10:00] * jnthn runs a `zef install Text::CSV` without the latest Rakudo pull

[10:03] <jnthn> it fails because I typed Test::CSV :P

[10:03] <lizmat> he...

[10:03] <lizmat> it doesn't have to be Text::CSV, P5localtime will also do  :-)

[10:03] <lizmat> or unprint  :-)

[10:04] <jnthn> unprint is a cute name for read :P

[10:04] <jnthn> Or it prints backspaces, or? :)

[10:04] <lizmat> it bypasses $*OUT

[10:06] <jnthn> OK, Rakudo HEAD was make test/spectest clean for me; installing it now

[10:06] <jnthn> Text::CSV installed fine before that

[10:06] <jnthn> Trying unprint

[10:10] <jnthn> Also worked out

[10:11] <jnthn> Only thing I didn't do is install a new zef...

[10:18] <lizmat> with the bump, installing zef itself works, but installing a module with it doesn't

[10:18] <lizmat> reverting the bump locally again, to make 200% sure

[10:29] <lizmat> ok, verified, for me at least: HEAD without the bump is stable, passes test / spectest and allows zef to install modules

[10:30] <lizmat> bump MoarVM and zef cannot install modules

[10:30] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[10:32] <jnthn> OK. I won't have any time for it this side of GPW.

[10:33] <jnthn> And if I can't repro it, then there's not much I can do. I've too much to do today to nuke my install.

[11:48] <lizmat> I used to have a ~/bin dir early in my path with symlinks to zef/ raku etc

[14:20] <vrurg> lizmat: sure. I had to wipe out .precomp after every change yesterday.

[14:21] <lizmat> :-(   sorry

[14:22] <lizmat> I guess our tests of precomping are very insufficient  :-(

[14:25] <vrurg> lizmat: nothing to be sorry about. It's HEAD, things are breaking there! :D

[14:26] <vrurg> BTW, my own fix of re-dispatching seemingly broke my own project. Though it most likely means I did it all wrong in the project. :)

[14:29] <vrurg> lizmat: I couldn't stand but test it again. Unfortunately, deps are still broken. Changing a file causes: Missing or wrong version of dependency '/Users/vrurg/src/Raku/raku-Vikna/lib/Vikna/Widget.rakumod (Vikna::Widget)'

[14:29] <vrurg> But I'd try nuking the whole install first, considering your story.

[14:33] <lizmat> yeah, that's what I'm doing now to test every commit related to precomp

[15:03] *** lucasb joined
[15:07] <vrurg> lizmat: bad news: the deps are still broken. The likely cause is diamond dependecy. Changing a file works fine for a module where deps are linear vs. breaking one where two direct deps require a third one: A -> B -> C (ok) vs. D -> B -> C & D -> E -> C (fails)

[17:36] <vrurg> lizmat: Oh, you didn't see this message from me: bad news: the deps are still broken. The likely cause is diamond dependecy. Changing a file works fine for a module where deps are linear vs. breaking one where two direct deps require a third one: A -> B -> C (ok) vs. D -> B -> C & D -> E -> C (fails)

[18:56] <japhb> BTW, rebuild-all at 2020.02 did *not* fail on Test::Mock.  It did however fail at a later module that seems to have trouble on this particular machine.

[19:43] <tellable6> 2020-02-27T17:14:19Z #raku-dev <nine> lizmat: the PrecompilationId cache is just to avoid the costly validity check.

[20:51] <dumarchie> My fix for infix:<eqv> between Iterables did not make it into the new release :(

[20:52] <dumarchie> Is there a way to export a custom infix:<eqv> that will be picked up by Test's is-deeply ?

[21:03] <japhb> lizmat: I'm a bit slammed with $dayjob right now, but I'll see what I can do about narrowing it down.

[22:43] <lizmat> .ask vrurg does the problem still exist on HEAD ?

[22:43] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to vrurg

[22:48] <vrurg> lizmat: I'm on another bug in dispatchers. Will test when done.

[22:48] <lizmat> oki!

[22:48] <vrurg> thanks!

[22:48] <lizmat> no, thank you!  :-)

[22:51] *** hankache left
[23:03] <vrurg> lizmat: I just've notice there were no more commits. So, the problem is still there.

[23:04] <lizmat> ok

[23:04] <vrurg> The last commit from you is b712789e721ba01f43f7f8174c2ccbe40d4d8f2b

[23:04] <vrurg> linkable6: thanks :)

[23:04] <linkable6> vrurg, Anytime!

[23:04] <lizmat> just as a sanity test, could you check if the problem also exists when at 66b78ccbefecd6cb2ff41 ?

[23:04] <linkable6> (2020-02-23) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/66b78ccbef Merge pull request #3510 from tinmarino/master

[23:04] * vrurg loves these smart guys!

[23:06] <vrurg> lizmat: rebuilding...

[23:11] <vrurg> lizmat: looks like it's not there. I get an error, but it's runtime and unrelated.

[23:11] <lizmat> could you produce a gist to re-create the problem that you see on HEAD

[23:11] <lizmat> I'll take that on tomorrow morning...  first getting some sleep

[23:12] <vrurg> lizmat: I'd try but can't promise.

[23:12] <lizmat> whatever you can provide me to help me understand how I borked things

[23:13] <vrurg> Sure. I just want to hunt down my bug and have not much time left today.

[23:13] <lizmat> understood...

[23:13] <lizmat> good hunting!

[23:14] <lizmat> sleep&

[23:14] <vrurg> Hope I got the cause right, then it shouldn't be hard to golf down.

[23:14] <vrurg> lizmat: 'night!

[23:29] <vrurg> .tell lizmat Here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/vrurg/7f190ded041b78d57b987757576dbc4e ; interesting that I can only reproduce it with classes.
