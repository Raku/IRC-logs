[11:17] <codesections> how long would it take to cut a new release that adds a welcome message to Rakudo if we need to do so rather urgently?  I'm on TPF's legal committee, and we're having some difficulty getting the Raku trademark; we're still taking to the lawyer, but it's possible that our best option will be to add a welcome message to Rakudo similar to what we have in the --version output

[11:17] <codesections>  

[11:18] <sena_kun> codesections, adds nothing, but a welcome message? Tonight.

[11:18] <codesections> (e.g., something like "Welcome to Rakudo v2020.10 implementing Raku v6.d")

[11:18] <sena_kun> codesections, point?

[11:19] <lizmat> when should this welcome message be shown ?

[11:19] <sena_kun> Ah, of course, including _only_ releasing, not someone writing the code.

[11:20] <lizmat> I guess the install script that says "Rakudo installed succesfully!" now, could be adapted for that?

[11:21] <lizmat> but should this also run with a package installer ?

[11:22] *** AlexDaniel` joined
[11:22] <sena_kun> lizmat, I would expect to see this message when repl is started.

[11:23] <lizmat> that should be easy to fix  :-)

[11:29] <sena_kun> lizmat, let's wait for more details from codesections

[11:30] <codesections> (sorry, my connection dropped for a bit, but I didn't miss any messages)

[11:30] <sena_kun> ok

[11:30] <sena_kun> codesections, so how urgent is "urgent"?

[11:31] <codesections> the legal requirement is for "launch screens that show the mark in an introductory message box that appears after opening the program".  As I said, we're still talking to the lawyer, but I _think_ a into message when starting the REPL would fit thatbox

[11:32] <lizmat> Files=1336, Tests=113604, 218 wallclock secs (29.53 usr  8.46 sys + 3047.00 cusr 283.43 csys = 3368.42 CPU)

[18:05] <gfldex> I tried to implement it in CORE and failed for that reason.
