[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: There was a few issues related to `multi submethod`:

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: - no autogenerated `proto`

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: - added to the `%!methods` instead of `%!submethods`

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: - manually declared `proto submethod` was conflicting with `multi` of

[00:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:   the same `submethod` resulting in "method already defined" exception.

[06:10] <tellable6> 2020-10-20T19:31:13Z #raku-dev <lizmat> sena_kun created a branch with the NativeCall fix reverted, for easier Blin testing: nativecall-fix-reverted

[06:12] <sena_kun> Ouch. :|

[06:13] <sena_kun> codesections, it was fast two weeks ago when it was originally asked for, but nobody contacted me to _actually_ do a point, so it slipped. But we have a release this weekend, hopefully. I hope the delay did not break anything.
