[16:09] <rba> patrickb: When we like to go this route, we need to make sure the builds are automatically tested and gpg signed as well...

[16:10] <patrickb> Good point. Didn't think about that. They are tested already. But signing is a different beast.

[16:12] <patrickb> It seems to be possible to automatically sign stuff: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/helm-provenance?view=azure-devops

[16:12] <patrickb> The key will have to reside on azure servers though.

[16:13] <rba> I would rather prefer you upload the files yourself directly.

[16:15] <patrickb> I think a group of possible uploaders is a good thing to have. The last few releases it always took me 2-4 days to find the time to do the build. So having a bit of redundancy might be good.

[16:16] <patrickb> (Up until now building on Windows still needed to be done manually. That's now also automated, so the effort ofdoing a build has sunk considerably.)

[16:34] <patrickb> bartolin_: Thanks for tackling this!

[16:38] <rba> patrickb: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml Wow. Good work...

[16:39] <patrickb> It's kind of a monster I have created there. More than one facepalm happened during the process.

[16:41] <rba> patrickb: When I played around with azure build pipelines it took me plenty of time to get things to work properly.

[16:42] <patrickb> I hope it'll be a long time before we do the next switch of CI pipeline. :-)

[16:43] <rba> patrickb: We may adopt this for the star release as well...

[16:59] <bartolin_> patrickb: do you know if it is possible to tolerate the failures during 'make install' for the JVM backend on Windows for now? For the record: For travis we allow failures for the JVM backend. (Though it might make sense to change that.)

[17:01] <patrickb> bartolin_: I have discussed this a bit with sena_kun. It's not easy to tolerate only some failures. AzureCI is missing a feature there.

[17:01] <Altai-man_> bartolin_, it is kind of "all or nothing" situation.

[17:01] <patrickb> We could just not test that combination. That would be easy.

[17:03] <Altai-man_> bartolin_, is it an absolutely mad wish to have JVM backend build-able? It might be hard to un-bitrot it, but once it's done, it will be much easier to fix it again if something regresses because you have the exact commit and know a single fix is necessary.

[17:03] *** Altai-man_ is now known as sena_kun

[17:04] <bartolin_> no, no, nothing mad about that ;) It even builds, so I hope it's not too hard to make it installable, too.

[17:06] <bartolin_> it only makes me a bit uncomfortable to see the failing builds all the time ;)

[17:06] <sena_kun> bartolin_, you mean the builds will faill all the time until JVM backend will be un-bitrotted or there is something more?

[17:07] <bartolin_> timotimo: do you have a commit or issue for  "allow decode to push into already existing array"? It looks like the problem only happens on Windows ...

[17:08] <bartolin_> sena_kun: I was just referring to all those red marks at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/

[17:09] <bartolin_> sena_kun: it makes it harder to see other (new) problems

[17:09] <sena_kun> bartolin_, I would not mind them as long as we are moving to the right direction. I mean, we had the same thing for a month or something until niner++ has fixed SEVG on Windows and not a lot of people complained about it.

[17:10] <patrickb> sena_kun: How would you approach retiring the other CI backends? My proposal is to give it a week or so time to see whether any other problem come up and then just remove the other CI integrations.

[17:10] <bartolin_> bartolin_: well, ok :) 

[17:10] <sena_kun> bartolin_, how much can it take to get it green? In rough terms, of course.

[17:12] <timotimo> ah too slow

[17:12] <MasterDuke> if we only have limited resources on any one provider, maybe we can split up the higher level work. e.g., test the build/install on each commit with azure, do coverage reports on a not-quite-as-frequent bases with appveyor, ...

[17:12] <sena_kun> patrickb, I suspect enabling them back is just a click or ten, so sounds reasonable. But I would put it into Weekly or something so that more people wouldn't be too surprised. So "posting in a weekly" + a week of time.

[17:16] <bartolin_> sena_kun: I really don't know. It might be a matter of a few hours. But I can't promise anything, since my time resources for hacking are limited
