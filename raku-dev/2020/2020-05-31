[08:01] <nine> Trying to get more info, I've put another workaround in place and got a third failure. Again a VMNull resulting from a getlex of a block's argument in a nested scope run at BEGIN time. $v in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Variable.pm6#L56

[08:02] <nine> Why would storing MAST::Frames in the outer compiler's @!frames result in such nested scopes getting no values for lexicals of the outer scope?

[08:03] <nine> It feels like this description should be enough of a hint already :/

[08:38] <Geth> ¦ nqp: review: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/b7709b7b80

[08:45] <patrickb> I have just requested to install the AzureCI hooks to Raku/nqp. I'd be grateful for someone with permissions to approve. This will allow me to enable AzureCI testing for NQP.

[09:19] <JJMerelo> patrickb I've received the request, but once I authorize it in GitHub it redirects me to my own account in Microsoft online

[09:19] <JJMerelo> patrickb I'm not sure that's exactly what you want.

[09:20] <patrickb> I can imagine that's actually fine.

[09:20] <JJMerelo> patrickb I guess that as long as it runs, it does not really matter whose account it is...

[09:20] <patrickb> Can I invite you to the AzureCI orgs?

[09:20] <patrickb> What's your email?

[09:20] <JJMerelo> jjmerelo at outlook.es

[09:21] <JJMerelo> patrickb maybe I need to set up some email notifications?

[09:21] <patrickb> Invite sent

[09:26] <JJMerelo> patrick accepted

[09:27] <JJMerelo> patrick I should maybe add the pipeline ot that organization?

[09:28] <patrickb> JJMerelo: Azure now tells me the Raku/nqp repo is part of a different organization (it doesn't tell me which).

[09:28] <patrickb> The correct organization would be 'Raku'

[09:28] <JJMerelo> It's the "jjmerelo" organization

[09:29] <JJMerelo> I'm trying to figure out how to transfer it. Maybe there's some button to request a transfer?

[09:32] <patrickb> A quick search didn't give any hints that that's possible.

[09:33] <JJMerelo> Maybe you need to request authorization again, and I need to log in as part of the new organization?

[09:33] <patrickb> One can actually have multiple Azure orgs associated with one github repo. So I suspect a transfer functionality is not availabe.

[09:33] <patrickb> Also only the first azure org can interact with the repo much. So the other connected azure orgs should be removed.

[09:34] <JJMerelo> So, removing it.

[09:37] *** sena_kun joined
[09:38] <patrickb> the original request to authorize the Raku azure org is not there anymore? (It's still visible for me)

[09:38] <patrickb> If it's not there anymore I can cancel the request.

[09:38] <JJMerelo> I can still add it by hand, but the problem is that it does not allow me to select Raku as organization in Azure

[09:38] <JJMerelo> patrickb maybe I don't have the privileges to do that in the Azure DevOps orga?

[09:40] <sena_kun> >"Installed 23 minutes ago" so I'm late, I guess.

[09:40] <JJMerelo> sena_kun um, not quite... We're still figuring out how to add it to the Raku organization.

[09:40] <patrickb> Hm. Azure tells me it's still registered with another org.

[09:41] <patrickb> It seems I can't request access again until that other connection is removed...

[09:41] <sena_kun> I'm looking at `Raku` org settings and 1)Azure Pipelines (OAuth) in Third-party access is "Approved", and "Installed GitHub Apps" has "Azure Pipelines" as if that's enabled, I can "configure" it.

[09:41] <sena_kun> It has access to nqp repo.

[09:42] <sena_kun> So seems enabled to me for Raku org, no?

[09:42] <JJMerelo> Access is OK, I guess, sena_kun It's not in the raku org, because it was initially assigned to me and my "org"

[09:43] <JJMerelo> patrick I seem to have only "stakeholder" access to the Raku Azure DevOps org. Does that allow me to add new repos?

[09:43] <patrickb> There is a 'Raku' org both in github and Azure.

[09:43] <JJMerelo> patrickb because it does not look as if I can... 

[09:43] <patrickb> Dunno. I made the 'raku-infra' user the owner of that org

[09:44] <patrickb> Maybe more people need the passwort to that account...

[09:44] <sena_kun> patrickb++ # fixing the tests failing on new CI is very cool

[09:45] <JJMerelo> patrickb this is what stakeholders in azure pipelines can do https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process#features

[09:45] <JJMerelo> patrickb maybe you can bump up my access in the organization some?

[09:48] <patrickb> Access levels are: "Basic", "Stakeholder" and "Visual Studio Subscriber"

[09:48] <patrickb> You and I are both set to "Stakeholder"

[09:49] <JJMerelo> patrickb but you can give access to individual items: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking?view=azure-devops

[09:50] <JJMerelo> patrickb OK, wait, I think I have added it now

[09:51] <JJMerelo> patrickb can you please check?

[09:52] <JJMerelo> patrickb or maybe not. The organization I get now is jjmerelo0004 instead of Raku

[09:52] <patrickb> Still displays "The repository Raku/nqp is in use with the Azure Pipelines GitHub App in another Azure DevOps organization. Learn more"

[09:53] <patrickb> Maybe it needs to be configured on the github side and not the azure side

[09:53] <JJMerelo> patrickb Yep, I got that, but I was able to add it anyway. Can you walk me through how you get to that?

[09:54] <JJMerelo> patrick I can't even figure out how to get to the organization account instead of my account...

[09:54] <patrickb> Select azure Raku org. Pipelines -> Pipelines -> Create Pipeline -> GitHub -> Search and Select 'Raku/nqp' repo -> A banner with that message will appear at the top

[09:54] <patrickb> To select an org click on the "Azure DevOps" logo at the top left

[09:55] <patrickb> Then the Orgs are listed on the left

[09:55] <patrickb> I'm shown the orgs "Raku", "Rakudo", "patrickboeker", "MoarVM", and three more that are irrelevant

[09:56] <patrickb> Clicking on one of those will show the contained projects in the center

[09:57] <patrickb> To configure an organization, select it and then click on "Organization settings" in the bottom left. Not to be confused with "Project settings" which are shown in the bottom left once one has selected a project

[09:58] <JJMerelo> I'm trying in every which way, but when I get to the "Setup your Azure pipelines project" I simply can't select the "Raku" organization, patrickb

[09:58] <JJMerelo> I don't seem to have that kind of access in that orga. Maybe I need to be admin?

[09:59] <patrickb> JJMerelo: I just made you the owner of the Raku org

[09:59] <JJMerelo> patrickb that's the thing, if I click there that organization is not listed. Let me check again.

[10:00] <JJMerelo> patrickb OK, we're getting somewhere now. I can see it now listed.

[10:00] <patrickb> Fun thing: I can change the org owner even though I have little permissions myself :-P

[10:01] <JJMerelo> patrickb founder's privilege

[10:01] <JJMerelo> I'm running it now, check it out 

[10:01] <JJMerelo> I'm afraid all Raku repositories are now in the "nqp" project

[10:01] <JJMerelo> I mean, whatever

[10:01] <JJMerelo> We'll figure it out later.

[10:02] <JJMerelo> patrickb thanks for this, I'm finding it very valuable as learning for the cloud computing class I teach at the university. I'd never used it before :-)

[10:02] <patrickb> looking good!

[10:03] <JJMerelo> 8) (y) <3 

[10:04] <JJMerelo> patrickb I find GitHub actions kinda simpler to use, anyway...

[10:07] <patrickb> OK. Rakudo and NQP are done. Only MoarVM left to go.

[10:07] <patrickb> JJMerelo: Should I keep you the org owner or should I switch back to raku-infra?

[10:08] <JJMerelo> patrickb give it a try. Now Azure pipelines has access to all Raku repos. I don't think I need privileges any more.

[10:09] <patrickb> Done.
