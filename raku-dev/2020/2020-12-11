[13:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/faster-slice-assignment: 

[13:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/faster-slice-assignment: - restore behaviour of itemized positions Iterable

[13:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/faster-slice-assignment:   Don't let it return a List, but a raw container as before

[13:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/faster-slice-assignment: - make sure that binding slices has similar behaviour

[13:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/faster-slice-assignment:   Specifically wrt lazy positions Iterables and itemized positions

[14:55] <nine> 2 1/2 hours later, it's done. Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master Rev. 1.2 and Ryzen 9 5950X are ordered and with a little luck I'll get them next week. How I hate buying stuff...

[14:57] <lizmat> that sounds like a monster

[15:11] <sena_kun> Sounds like "How to make a Blin in 30 minutes".

[15:15] <nine> Should also have very nice single thread performance, so I hope the build time will be cut in half :)

[15:21] <sena_kun> In half? What's your current spec?

[15:25] <nine> an 1800X

[15:29] <sena_kun> I see. Well, this is not the whole build, but e.g. Stage parse when migrating from a dead cheapest laptop chip with -U mark to 3900X went from 51 seconds to 36. Parallel compilation will be greatly faster, though. Would be interesting to look at your measurements. :)
