[22:25] <vrurg> patrickb: BTW, saw your question, forgot to answer. Do you object to using RUNNER for the cleanup script?

[22:26] <patrickb> vrurg: Didn't look into that, so I don't have an opinion atm

[22:26] <vrurg> patrickb: I'm ok with the merge but would prefer RUNNER over a cleanup-dedicated variable.

[22:27] <patrickb> vrurg: I'll have a look. But I first need to fix update-submodules.pl which I aparently just busted. :-(

[22:47] <benlittle> Has there been any recent success deploying raku/moar to a docker container? The image on docker hub is out of date.

[22:50] <patrickb> benlittle: Rakudo should work in a docker container without problems.

[22:50] <patrickb> benlittle: I guess the images being out of date is probably simply "not done yet".

[22:50] <benlittle> Is there an existing build pipeline for rakudo?

[22:51] <patrickb> vrurg: I'm unsure what you mean with cleanup-dedicated variable.

[22:52] <patrickb> vrurg: I've now switched it over to use the runner.

[22:52] <patrickb> benlittle: You mean for creating releases?

[22:53] <benlittle> Yes, I see this https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/.travis.yml. I'm not really famiiar with travis though ðŸ˜¦

[22:54] <patrickb> That pipeline is worked on at the moment. Docker images are not part of the official releases though. The images that are available on docker hub are created separately.

[22:54] <benlittle> Does that actually build the release?

[22:55] <patrickb> benlittle: Well, "building the release" basically means running loads of tests and signing + uploading a source tarball. That's currently a manual process, because we want the tight control.

[22:56] <patrickb> But the build of the precompiled packages (those created by nxadm and also those available on rakudo.org) are built in an automated fashion.

[22:57] <benlittle> Got it. Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ

[22:57] <patrickb> I think nxadm rakudo-pkg packages are created using a travis pipeline (see https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/), while the ones on rakudo.org use a CircleCI pipeline.

[22:59] <vrurg> patrickb: my bad, it's not dedicated to cleanup. Still, we use RUN_RAKUDO for the script and I think at this point we better be using RUNNER.

[23:00] <patrickb> vrurg: I have already switched the PR over to using runner in the meantime.

[23:01] <vrurg> patrickb: *where is my thumb up emoji??* :)

[23:01] <patrickb> ugh... Github auto closed that PR. because of a push I did. Second time this happend.

[23:02] <patrickb> as far as I know I can't revive such a PR. I have to create a new one...
