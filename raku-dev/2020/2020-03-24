[15:04] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: it would be nice to commemorate them more extensively in a separate

[23:41] <tellable6> 2020-03-16T22:57:15Z #raku <tbrowder> tony-o the travis thing appears to be their problem, a restart worked

[23:41] <tellable6> 2020-03-18T12:24:25Z #raku <tbrowder> tony-o the docker file failed with Inline::Perl5 as dependency in META6.json

[23:41] <tellable6> 2020-03-18T13:43:47Z #raku <tbrowder> tony-o see my PR #4 for your rakudo-nightly

[23:41] <tony-o> oh god

[23:42] <tony-o> .tell tbrowder merged rakudo-nightly

[23:42] <tellable6> tony-o, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[23:52] <Xliff> .tell AlexDaniel Blin run never finished. Ran it over night and it looked to be an endless loop. Do you have another, smaller invocation so I can see what's going on?

[23:52] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel

[23:53] <AlexDaniel`> do you have a log of that?

[23:53] *** AlexDaniel left
[23:53] *** AlexDaniel joined
[23:53] <Xliff> I should. Assuming the log was created

[23:53] <AlexDaniel> I mean, in your terminal

[23:54] <Xliff> Um. No.

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: so what was the last line you remember?

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> what did it say?

[23:54] <Xliff> It kept running the same thing over and over. 

[23:54] <Xliff> 2 jobs out of 4

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> okay

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> let's try with these arguments only: --old=2018.06 --new=2018.09 Foo::Regressed

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> I'll investigate meanwhile
