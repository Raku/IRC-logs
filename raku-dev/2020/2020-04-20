[16:21] <timotimo> quite possible; it's linear in the complexity of the call graph and there's a slight impact from having a lot of GC runs

[16:40] <guifa2> Is there anyway to conditionally set the bitness of a native int?  Something like my native $foo = $tiny ?? my uint8 $ !! my uint16 $?

[16:51] <lizmat> m: my $a is repr("P6Int") is Int is nativesize(8)  # meh

[16:54] <lizmat> I guess $*REPR is only set when compiling the setting  # guifa2

[18:23] <guifa2> nine++.  That's one piece solved.  Looks like I'll need to parameterization to enforce it on attributes, since it seems that an Any type container will rebox it

[22:36] <gfldex> is there a reason why there is only a dir sub but not a method?

[22:36] <gfldex> .&dir works but looks out of place

[22:37] <jnthn> There is on an IO

[22:37] <jnthn> Just not on Str

[22:38] <gfldex> that's an ENODOC then.
