[11:35] <MasterDuke> lizmat++ hope i wasn't being pushy

[11:36] <lizmat> MasterDuke: no, you made valid points and the resulting PR is better for it

[15:07] <[Coke]> dumb nit: I'd replace ... with &hellip;

[15:08] <[Coke]> but in general, seems fine. +1 for merging.

[15:09] * [Coke] is now curious how coverage testing works at all. :)

[15:12] *** MasterDuke joined
[15:14] * vrurg_ got a situation where a callback is invoked with wrong closure. oops...

[15:14] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[15:15] <vrurg> Wish I have an idea how to golf it down.

[15:18] <[Coke]> when in doubt, start commenting out code and put it back when it starts working. (I've done this the hard way a few times to try to reduce the amount of code needed to trigger something.)

[15:19] <[Coke]> and maybe in the process you can see the shape of the thing that is causing the error.

[15:26] <vrurg> [Coke]: Let me paraphrase it: wish I know a shorter way. ;)

[15:26] <[Coke]> :)

[15:26] <[Coke]> How big is the whole code base?

[15:28] <vrurg> It's rather small, 300-400 lines. It's a re-write of Async::Workers.

[15:29] <vrurg> Yet, I've already spent so much on his re-write, that want to be over with it ASAP. :(

[19:37] <vrurg> Altai-man: are you still around?

[19:41] <Altai-man> vrurg, yeah

[19:42] <vrurg> Ok, ignore the question in the ticket. :) How do you run blin against a branch in the main repo?

[19:42] <vrurg> --new didn't work for me.

[19:42] <Altai-man> vrurg, hm, using `--new`. "Didn't work" as when?

[19:43] <vrurg> The day I merged into the branch.

[19:44] <vrurg> Ok, it was too early, perhaps. Looks as it started now.

[19:44] <Altai-man> Great. I can do a run if needed.

[19:47] <vrurg> Nevermind, should be fine now. Minor glitches like missing zstd or locked dir, but should be fine.

[19:47] <Altai-man> have fun
