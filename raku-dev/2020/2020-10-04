[08:17] <MasterDuke> anyone have an idea why https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Numeric.pm6#L242-L260 (`multi sub infix:<%%>(Int:D \a, Int:D \b) {`) isn't in Int.pm6?

[08:20] <MasterDuke> looks like there is an Int candidate for each of gcd and lcm that also belong in Int.pm6

[08:21] <MasterDuke> lizmat: just an oversight in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/755e25bd575c681c2361749daa12977f93def3d3 ?

[10:23] <lizmat> MasterDuke: pretty sure I just followed with whatever was there, so I have no idea why it lives there

[10:23] <lizmat> MasterDuke: I'd say, move it and see what happens

[10:24] <lizmat> generally, some things need to be done in a specific order in the setting, so there *could* be a reason it lives where it lives, then again, that reason can have disappeared since then

[10:25] <lizmat> the setting *is* bootstrapping itself: e.g. a trait on a Routine needs to have been defined before it can be applied to a routine  :-)

[10:27] <lizmat> this is the reason for the weird src/core.c/precedence file: at the time the operators were defined, you could not apply the precedence trait yet because it didn't exist yet

[10:27] <lizmat> so it happens at BEGIN time close to the end of setting compilation

[11:19] <Xliff> lizmat: Can you tell me why my RakuAST samples don't run, but the test codes appear to run fine?

[11:20] <lizmat> the rakuast branch is really two projects in one

[11:20] <Xliff> And yes, I am setting RAKUDO_RAKUAST, but I am getting typed_panic exceptions

[11:23] <lizmat> one is the building the RakuAST class hierarchy

[11:24] <lizmat> the tests in t/12-rakuast test those, and that's what I've been working on

[11:24] <Xliff> I know. 

[11:24] <lizmat> the other is replacing the src/Perl/Grammar|Actions|World with src/Raku/Grammar|Actions

[11:25] <lizmat> that's what you activate with RAKUDO_RAKUAST

[11:25] <Xliff> So why is it, when I copy code from t/12-rakuast, and try them in my sample code, they don't work? I figure I'm not in the right environment.

[11:25] <lizmat> (sprry, just mentioning it for people less informaed)

[11:25] <Xliff> And I JUST TOLD YOU that I set that variable.

[11:25] <Xliff> And I am getting typed_panic exceptions.

[11:25] <nine> Xliff: no need to shout

[11:26] <Xliff> So if there is a bug, where do I report?

[11:26] <Xliff> If there is something else I need to do, what is it?

[11:27] <lizmat> Xliff: currently, only 200+ spectest files pass their tests, out 0f 1336

[11:27] <lizmat> so I think it's likely you're running into uncovered parts of the migration pretty quickly

[11:27] <Xliff> Yes, and I am using code that passes in a different type of script.

[11:27] <lizmat> with all sorts of ... interesting errors

[11:28] <Xliff> Maybe code will help explain.

[11:28] <lizmat> it probably will, it will allow me to double check the problems you're seeing

[11:29] <Xliff> This is the script I am currently trying to run: https://repl.it/@Xliff/AshamedBeautifulBudgetrange#main.raku

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rakuast: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4dd89c5799

[11:30] <Xliff> Much of this should look familiar. It's all in t/12-rakuast

[11:30] <Xliff> When I invoke via: RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 perl6 ~/test-ast.pl6

[11:31] <Xliff> I get: ===SORRY!===

[11:31] <Xliff> Cannot find method 'typed_panic' on object of type Raku::Grammar

[11:31] <lizmat> ah..  but if you're doing that, you should *not* use the RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 

[11:32] <Xliff> Fair enough. If I don't, I get: "Too many positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 2

[11:32] <Xliff>   in block <unit> at /home/cbwood/test-ast.pl6 line 5"

[11:32] <lizmat> yeah, that's because recently the interface for Expression has changed

[11:32] <lizmat> from taking a single positional, to a named expression => parameter

[11:32] <Xliff> So why are the tests working?

[11:32] <Xliff> I mean, this is code lifted right out of a working test.

[11:33] <lizmat> but from a few days ago ?

[11:33] <Xliff> Currently active git code! 

[11:33] <lizmat> the current tests use expression => 

[11:33] <Xliff> I can go and run the script containing the active code in this script and it will work just fine.

[11:33] <lizmat> since 0c81db7ae38aa06eead466b2

[11:34] <lizmat> I added "expression => " in two locations in your code, and it then runs fine

[11:35] <Xliff> So ::Expression is now "expression =>" ?

[11:35] <lizmat> ::Expression.new( expression => ... )  indeed

[11:35] <Xliff> OK. Adjusting

[11:37] <Xliff> OK. Works. Thank you!

[11:37] <lizmat> you're welcome

[11:37] <lizmat> glad to see more eyes on it

[11:39] <lizmat> Xliff: BTW, you can now also do "dd $ast" to see a source representation of the AST

[11:40] <Xliff> lizmat++ 

[11:40] <Xliff> Good to know, thanks!

[11:40] <Xliff> Also, if I do run into bugs, where is the best place to report them?

[11:41] <lizmat> I guess making an issue for it is best

[11:42] <lizmat> I'll create tags for "if you're working on building code with RakuAST classes" and "using RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1"

[11:45] <Altai-man> Isn't RakuAST incomplete to get issues?

[11:45] <timotimo> never too early to complain :) :) :) :)

[11:45] <lizmat> well, the RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 part definitely is

[11:46] <lizmat> but the RakuAST:: class development (as far as it is developed) *should* work now, and works as far as tests are concerned now (apart from some minor todos)

[11:46] <Altai-man> I don't follow closely, but remember, hmm, "Try it out, break it, etc. (Please don't report things that are missing at this point. Most things are, so it's not that useful. :-))". I suspect it is not caused by a missing thing, so sorry for not backlogging enough.

[11:46] <lizmat> again, running code with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 is definitely *NOT* ready for issue reporting yet

[11:47] <lizmat> code that uses the RakuAST classes, like my re-implementation of sprintf, definitely is

[11:48] <timotimo> has .assuming been attempted on rakuast yet?

[11:48] <Xliff> How is that going, by the way?>

[11:48] <Xliff> lizmat: ^^ # re sprintf

[11:48] <lizmat> it's implemented using RakuAST in the rakuast branch now

[11:48] * Xliff goes to check.

[11:49] <lizmat> currently it's called zprintf for easier testing / comparison with sprintf

[11:49] <Xliff> sourcebaby: 2.sprintf("%d")

[11:50] <Xliff> sourceable: 2.sprintf("%d")

[11:50] <sourceable6> Xliff, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/62a22d0/src/core.c/Cool.pm6#L391

[11:50] <lizmat> src/core.e/Formatter.pm6

[11:51] <Xliff> lizmat: Ah. Thanks.

[11:51] <lizmat> only available with 'use 6.e.PREVIEW'

[11:54] <lizmat> Xliff: if you really want to get into this, you could have a look at re-implementing "assuming" in RakuAST  :-)

[11:54] <lizmat> Ah, I just notice timotimo mentioned assuming

[11:54] <Xliff> Heh. I may take a look. This is only my first day looking at it, and all

[11:55] <lizmat> yeah... it may be rather steep

[11:55] <Xliff> Nice thought, though.

[11:55] <lizmat> yeah, it's one of the few places in core that uses STRING eval atm

[11:55] <Xliff> I am trying to get some footing for the eventual Macro implementation

[11:55] <Xliff> I am probably going to need it for my p6-GLib projects

[11:56] *** Kaiepi left
[11:58] *** Kaiepi joined
[11:58] <lizmat> Xliff: without a macro implementation, I think you can already do quite some "damage" with creating your own custom AST's in a library and then EVALling them to get code to execute

[11:59] <lizmat> Xliff: in any case, I'm first going to look at the use of EVAL in CURI, and then if nobody has beaten me to it, look at assuming

[12:00] <lizmat> BTW, another one is src/core.c/INTERPOLATE  :-)

[12:02] <Xliff> OK, I will follow along, then.

[12:03] <lizmat> ok, MAKE_REGEX is still no go, as it needs :context for the EVAL, and that is as yet unsupported in rakuast last

[12:03] <lizmat> *land

[12:08] *** Kaiepi left
[12:11] *** leont joined
[12:11] *** Kaiepi joined
[12:14] <Xliff> Mmm: 0-cost sprintf! 

[12:14] <Xliff> lizmat: Is that why you called it zprintf? :)

[12:15] <nine> lizmat: EVAL in CURI will usually want evaluation via the AST instead of full blown compilation as it's rather simple expressions that are only run once

[12:16] <lizmat> Xliff: actually, no, just something phonetically close, but it's a nice idea

[12:16] <timotimo> the DependencySpecification.new(...) blah?

[12:16] <lizmat> nine: yeah, that was my thought as well

[12:16] <nine> timotimo: yes

[12:16] *** Kaiepi left
[12:23] <timotimo> i wonder if most dependency specifications are simple enough to be parsed by a much simplified grammar without a need for compilation anyway, though of course RakuAST is so close that it could also be a waste of time

[12:24] <nine> They are - it's what we do on JVM

[12:24] <nine> But we only need to evaluate them when we need to re-scan dependencies, i.e. after anything changed in any repository

[12:24] <timotimo> oh

[12:26] <nine> So there are actually 3 stages: take forever as we need to compile, just check if any dependency changed, everything is the same as last time: just load this flat list of files and be done
