[13:59] <sena_kun> Github is down, hmmm.

[14:46] <AlexDaniel`> the error is wrong maybe

[14:47] <AlexDaniel`> or maybe it went beyond its API limit x)

[14:50] <sena_kun> Well, even without this I still see we have 3 blockers until Saturday.

[14:50] <AlexDaniel`> right, ‚ÄúSorry kid, that's not my department.‚Äù means it cannot even gist the error

[14:50] <AlexDaniel`> give it an hour or so for the API limit to reset‚Ä¶ :)

[14:51] <moritz> this reminds me of the Tom Lehrer song about Wernher von Braun "Once rockets are up, who cares where they come done? That's not my department"

[14:52] <moritz> ... says Wernher von Braun
