[19:12] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset

[19:12] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2020-03-09T19:12:15Z”

[19:12] <lizmat> hmmm... I seem to remember some Perl 6 -> Raku renaming having taken place the past week...

[19:13] <lizmat> but can't remember it :-(

[19:13] <lizmat> can somebody refresh my memory ?

[19:31] <leont> nine, patrickb: list form is implemented on perl 5.22+

[19:31] <leont> (on Windows)

[19:32] <nine> leont: oh, that's certainly good to know!

[19:32] <leont> But that node is running 5.20.1, because Murphy

[19:33] <nine> Well it does so because we tell it to

[19:33] <patrickb> I'm working on that specific problem ATM. Currently trying to find out what exactly Windows does when using the non-list form of open.

[19:33] <nine> patrickb: well we could just use a newer Perl version :)

[19:34] <leont> You really don't want to know what it does when using the non-list form…

[19:35] <leont> Just upgrading that perl version should be the easier fix anyway

[19:35] <patrickb> Best alternative? qx{}? That's what I started with and was told to move away from :-/

[19:36] <patrickb> The code in question is part of the rakudo build system. Bumping the dependency from 5.10 to 5.20 for that is no option I'd say.

[19:36] <leont> Why not?

[19:37] <leont> On Windows, no one uses system perl because there is no system perl

[19:37] <leont> So the required perl version on Windows isn't nearly as relevant as on unix platforms

[19:38] <patrickb> Is using platform specific use 1.2.3 statements possible?

[19:39] <nine> Do we need that?

[19:40] <[Coke]> if it's part of the build, updating is a much bigger ask, I agree with patrickb there.

[19:41] <patrickb> nine: What would be the alternative? Just leaving out the `use version` thing?

[19:46] <leont> patrickb: my $version = 5.020; require $version;

[19:55] <rba> patrickb: rakudo-moar-2020.02.1-01-* builds for linux/macos/win is online on https://rakudo.org/downloads

[19:57] <leont> (also, wouldn't it be nice if the raku build system was in nqp, so that there wasn't an external dependency?)

[20:01] <[Coke]> leont: You need to get rid of the dep at the moarvm level first.

[20:01] <[Coke]> (or it's just hiding)

[20:02] <leont> There are a zillion well-supported tools for a C project like moarvm

[20:04] <leont> And yes, that's still an external dependency, but at least it could be a very common dependency.

[20:04] <leont> Anyone compiling anything in C/C++ already has cmake installed nowadays.

[20:04] <patrickb> The last huge rewrite of the build system (including a lengthy discussion of using something built in nqp) is less that a year ago. I really don't want to go into that business. :-(

[20:05] <rba> patrickb: might not the proposed qx{} better than open pipe list on windows?

[20:06] <patrickb> rba: If I can't come up with a better solution... yeah...

[20:11] <rba> patrickb: afaik qx{} is as good as system()

[21:09] <lizmat> no, maybe jnthn ?

[21:12] <nine> MasterDuke: FWIW PR 3533 looks plausible to me

[21:14] <MasterDuke> nine: cool. i also had tried the same trick with the method cache, but the rakudo install would fail. i wrapped the `publish_method_cache` in `nqp::swb(disable|enable)` and that got it to install, but there were still many spectest fails

[21:16] <MasterDuke> so there's still more performance to be gained. i.e., the 1m `find_method` still happening

[22:35] <AlexDaniel`> Is everything alright? :-)

[22:35] <AlexDaniel`> I'll be away for another week, unfortunately :)

[22:36] <AlexDaniel`> but I'm online, so ping me if there's anything I need to do

[22:37] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel`: you got some other assignment than military service, correct?

[22:38] <AlexDaniel`> no

[22:38] <AlexDaniel`> I just had some wörk :-)

[22:38] <MasterDuke> ah. nice enough i guess

[22:40] <AlexDaniel`> I'm a little bit involved in streaming and filming local sport events, and it just happens that we had a Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix in Estonia last month (first time in Baltic countries I think)

[22:41] <AlexDaniel`> somewhat lucky because other similar events that were planned for later dates got cancelled because of the virus scare :-)

[22:41] <AlexDaniel`> and a lot of countries didn't even come :(

[22:42] <MasterDuke> used the hardware/software from your thesis?

[22:42] <AlexDaniel`> and yeah, we're using Raku for all the stream animations, camera motion control, automation, etc.

[22:43] <AlexDaniel`> yep

[22:43] <MasterDuke> cool

[22:43] <[Coke]> nice!

[22:44] <AlexDaniel`> it's a little bit weird being just a Raku user, without worrying about any implementation quirks and bugs

[22:44] <AlexDaniel`> but that has been my experience for the last few months, actually

[22:45] <AlexDaniel`> I think on some of the systems I don't even bother with rakudobrew, I just apt install it…

[22:45] <AlexDaniel`> BORING :-D

[22:47] <AlexDaniel`> and on top of that, the software was running for 12+ hours on some days, that's not just idling, it's actively talking to the hardware and stuff

[22:47] <AlexDaniel`> I haven't measured the mem usage but it was small enough that I didn't even care

[22:48] <MasterDuke> very nice

[22:52] <AlexDaniel`> there's a small bit in python because I needed opencv, but it's almost immediately zeromq-ed to other raku services
