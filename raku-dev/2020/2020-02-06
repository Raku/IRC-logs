[11:14] <nine> Apparently the German publisher Heise starts a new software developing conference end of September in Darmstadt: https://www.bettercode.eu/

[11:14] <nine> Call for proposals is open until March 20th. One of the topics they explicitly want to cover is contemporary programming languages.

[11:17] <nine> While the website seems to be German only, the call for proposals is actually available in English, too: https://www.bettercode.eu/call_for_proposals_en.php?source=0

[11:17] * jnthn read it as "Darnstadt" and was amused

[11:18] <nine> Considering that "Darm" is the German word for bowel, you may as well stick with the correct spelling for amusement :)

[11:19] <jnthn> Oh, lovely :P

[11:21] <nine> Anyway, in terms of marketing, conferences like this sound like golden opportunities. I think a talk like "Lessons taught by Raku that will help in any language" could garner some interest and therefore have some impact
