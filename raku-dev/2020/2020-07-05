[06:48] <Kaiepi> i can now get dns resolution to perform twice as well in v6.e compared to v6.c in the best case scenario, where the response to the AAAA query is received first and the address received can immediately be connected to

[06:49] <Kaiepi> which i think is about as fast as i can get it

[06:49] <Kaiepi> that depends on the connection to the dns server being the bottleneck though, on my vps that's not the case

[06:59] <Xliff> \o Kaiepi

[07:34] *** Kaiepi left
[07:35] <Xliff> MasterDuke: Doesn't look like I need to. I've pushed several times, already and just --tags doesn't seem to do anything

[07:35] *** JJMerelo left
[07:36] <MasterDuke> hm. maybe your git does it automatically. for me, i have to do a separate push with --tags

[07:37] <Xliff> Aha! I had to refetch tags from upstream.

[07:38] <Xliff> And now I have pushed and there they go.

[07:38] <Xliff> What's up with the city tags?

[07:39] <Xliff> Moscow, NewYork, Prague, SaltLake, etc?

[07:39] <MasterDuke> those were old releases before the naming was changed to yyyy.mm

[07:39] <Xliff> Ah.

[07:39] <Xliff> Should I be upset that there was no WashingtonDC?

[07:43] <MasterDuke> heh. i have no idea how the names were chosen, before my time

[07:43] <Xliff> Ah.

[07:44] <Xliff> OK. I think I've revived the parallel compiling thingy.

[07:44] <Xliff> Still some bugs I need to work on. I should refresh the PR.

[07:44] <Xliff> Still wondering why my spectest times are worse than lizmat's though.

[07:46] <MasterDuke> mine are about half hers. i get around 132s usually. but i have a newer cpu with more cores

[07:46] <Xliff> What are your specs?!?

[07:46] <MasterDuke> ryzen 3700x

[07:47] <Xliff> Actually. Try https://github.com/Xliff/rakudo.git - rakudo-precomp-nolock2 branch

[07:48] <Xliff> Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz here

[07:48] <Xliff> It seems odd that I am getting 232 seconds here.

[07:48] <Xliff> What is your memory speed?

[07:49] <MasterDuke> what's your TEST_JOBS set to?

[07:49] <Xliff> It's not.

[07:49] <MasterDuke> mine is 12

[07:49] <MasterDuke> you actually have 2 more physical cores than i do, it should be faster

[07:50] <Xliff> Using 18 and retesting

[07:51] <MasterDuke> my ram is 3200, but i doubt it makes a very big difference

[07:52] <lizmat> Files=1307, Tests=113021, 217 wallclock secs (29.59 usr  8.52 sys + 3030.83 cusr 286.92 csys = 3355.86 CPU)

[07:52] <Xliff> Though now I'm failing tests.

[07:53] *** Kaiepi joined
[07:54] <lizmat> 2.4 GHz i9 here, with SSD and 32G 2400 MhZ DDR4 RAM

[07:54] <Xliff> Wow. Mine came in 22 seconds slower than yours with one proc.

[07:54] <lizmat> TEST_JOBS=16

[07:57] <Xliff> Hmmmm..... TEST_JOBS=20 made mine slightly slower.

[07:57] <Xliff> Files=1307, Tests=112812, 158 wallclock secs (26.24 usr  3.79 sys + 2840.94 cusr 149.92 csys = 3020.89 CPU)

[07:59] <MasterDuke> Files=1307, Tests=113021, 136 wallclock secs (15.68 usr  2.34 sys + 1709.51 cusr 109.48 csys = 1837.01 CPU)

[07:59] <Xliff> Hrm. Memory is 2666, here

[07:59] <Xliff> So faster base clock and faster ram.

[07:59] <MasterDuke> (but i'm not running the Inline::Perl5 tests, so that might explain the difference)

[08:00] <Xliff> Why are my #Tests lower?

[08:01] <MasterDuke> don't know. `make m-spectest` always does a `git pull`, so it should be up-to-date

[08:01] <Xliff> I'm just doing "make spectest"

[08:02] <MasterDuke> should be the same. i just have m-spectest in my history because i sometimes build the jvm backend

[08:04] <MasterDuke> all tests passed

[08:05] <MasterDuke> might just be high ipc for my cpu and/or all the intel cpu vuln mitigations working against you

[08:06] <Xliff> Parse errors: No plan found in TAP output

[08:06] <MasterDuke> but honestly i would expect faster times for you with those two extra physical cores

[08:06] <Xliff> What does that mean?

[08:06] <Xliff> Yeah, but my base clock is 3.3GHz

[08:07] <MasterDuke> some error and the test file actually failed (i.e., not just a failed test, but a compiler error or something like that)

[08:08] <Xliff> OK. That may be due to some of the problems I'm still trying to work out.

[08:08] <MasterDuke> but there is a known problem that causes random fails like that in random test files. i get it even on master

[08:08] <Xliff> :/

[08:08] <Xliff> How is it determined if you run the Inline::Perl5 tests?

[08:09] <Xliff> If it's installed?

[08:09] <MasterDuke> i'll say at the beginning. `Inline::Perl5 not installed: not running Perl 5 integration tests`

[08:09] <MasterDuke> *it'll

[08:13] <Xliff> \o/

[08:13] <MasterDuke> do you have any local modifications to your roast checkout? that might prevent it updating

[08:13] <Xliff> I don't think so. This should be a fresh tree.

[08:14] <Xliff> And it was running the right number of tests 8 hours ago (and passing... :/ )

[08:15] <MasterDuke> any recent solar flare activity on the east coast? some random bits flipped somewhere?

[08:15] <Xliff> I know right?

[08:15] <Xliff> Maybe it's all of the firework smoke...

[08:16] <MasterDuke> maybe covid-19 has jumped to silicon

[08:16] <Xliff> Now all computers will need face masks.

[08:16] <Xliff> I so wish I had Photoshop skillz right now.

[09:13] <MasterDuke> cool

[09:15] <nine> I'm looking forward to seeing what in-process precompilation will do for those :)

[09:15] <MasterDuke> are the two efforts complementary?

[09:17] <nine> Yes. Xliff is working on different precompiling processes not having to wait for each other all the time. In-process precompilation gets rid of rakudo's startup overhead for one process precompiling multiple modules.

[09:17] <nine> Both can be combined into an n:m model.

[09:17] <nine> Also what helps multiple processes may become ground work for doing parallel in-process compilation

[09:18] <MasterDuke> very nice

[17:47] <timotimo> (this is nqp-m -e '')

[17:47] <lizmat> and it could probably benefit from looking whether there are any keys in %a before splatting them in

[17:48] <dogbert17> checking if something is lazy should be quite fast though

[17:48] <timotimo> it's quite possibly a megamorphic callsite, though, unless grep itself is inlined

[17:48] <timotimo> though + is flattening, potentially; not sure if we compile it non-flattening-ly when it doesn't need to

[17:49] <timotimo> new-disp, of course, makes this a non-issue

[17:49] <lizmat> dogbert17: map as a sub, is basically the same

[17:49] <dogbert17> new-disp, the solution to all out problems :-)

[17:49] <dogbert17> lizmat: yeah, I noticed that

[17:51] <timotimo> not all, we also need RakuAST :P

[17:52] <dogbert17> it seems to be a bit dangerous to assume, like I tend to do, that the sub and method form of something whould take roughly the same time to execute

[17:54] <timotimo> how about we systematically go through basically everything and record all the ratios

[17:58] <dogbert17> I have looked through some of them

[18:09] <timotimo> i just had to futz around a bit with the measurements, but now compile_mastop appears at 1.12% when nqp compiles MAST/Ops.nqp

[18:10] <timotimo> i was wondering if we should have a few simpler versions of that method for some of our ops

[18:52] <timotimo> i think i want to see what op the compile_mastop method is called with most often and perhaps special-case implement that

[18:56] <gfldex> raku my @a = 1,2,3; say @a>>.WHAT;

[18:56] <gfldex> raku: my @a = 1,2,3; say @a>>.WHAT;

[18:56] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar f550c9f97: OUTPUT: «(Array)␤»

[18:57] <gfldex> Should I have expected this?

[18:57] <timotimo> WHAT is too special for this to work

[18:59] <gfldex> So Raku does not guarantee introspection in all cases. Makes sense but throws ENODOC.

[19:04] <gfldex> raku: say (.WHAT for @a);

[19:04] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar f550c9f97: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) 04===SORRY!04=== Error while compiling /tmp/cYXe4JXFSN␤Variable '@a' is not declared␤at /tmp/cYXe4JXFSN:1␤------> 03say (.WHAT for 08⏏04@a);␤»

[19:04] <gfldex> raku: my @a = 1,2,3; say (.WHAT for @a);

[19:04] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar f550c9f97: OUTPUT: «((Int) (Int) (Int))␤»

[19:08] <gfldex> I wonder if implementing .WHAT as a AST macro could make this work as expected.

[19:31] *** stoned75 left
[19:49] <gfldex> raku: my &c = {;}; say &c.name.so, &c.name.defined;

[19:49] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar f550c9f97: OUTPUT: «FalseTrue␤»

[19:50] <gfldex> that just bit me when i used '.foo // .name'

[19:50] <gfldex> I think that should be undefined. Also that's another ENODOC.

[19:51] <gfldex> Or better should Block have a .name method?

[19:52] <gfldex> If it should then 'Block({.file.IO.basename}:{.line})' is much better then the empty string.

[20:01] <ShimmerFairy> as I recall, methods like .WHAT are supposed to be macros in the first place.

[21:23] <timotimo> i'm annoyed that rakudo doesn't compile with my changes to nqp's mast compiler :\

[21:46] <timotimo> one potential win could perhaps be replacing the "constants" the mastcompiler uses, like $MVM_operand_type_var, with a literal in some kind of preprocessing step, or manually and putting the source in a comment or so

[21:46] <timotimo> but probably tiny in terms of performance
