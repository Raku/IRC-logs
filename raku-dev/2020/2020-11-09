[09:30] <MasterDuke> hm. trying to pull an nqp::index out in front of grammar parsing might be quite difficult. doing it in the QAST::Block of a regex didn't really help because of the overhead of the parse() and ACCEPTS(), but maybe it would help for grammars?

[10:10] <MasterDuke> heh. i got it working with a simple grammar. but...it slows it down by a little

[10:21] *** MasterDuke left
[10:26] *** MasterDuke joined
[10:27] <MasterDuke> when a grammar is parsing some text, is any particular token applied against the entire thing? or some substring of the text? i.e., `self.target` in the QAST::Block of a token seems to be the entire text, but i'd rather work against something smaller

[10:29] <MasterDuke> oh, i guess i can use `.(from|to|pos)()`

[10:30] <moritz> token TOP applies to the whole file

[15:37] <MasterDuke> but it appears to do a lot of extra work, i'm not sure why, backtracking maybe?

[20:29] <gfldex> I did expect the iterator to decent into the Slip.

[20:30] <lizmat> why ?

[20:30] <lizmat> it is itemized, so it shouldn't anyway

[20:30] <lizmat> but even then

[20:30] <gfldex> because the docs say: A Slip is a List that automatically flattens into an outer List (or other list-like container or iterable).

[20:30] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] := (1,2).Slip; dd @a.iterator.pull-one

[20:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «slip(1, 2)␤»

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤»

[20:32] <lizmat> when you use an iterator, you're really on your own

[20:32] <gfldex> m: my @a; @a[0] = (1,2).Slip; dd $_ for @a;

[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «Slip @a = $(slip(1, 2))␤»

[20:32] <lizmat> it's the handling of whatever an iterator produces, is where the flattening happenbs

[20:32] <gfldex> I don't want to use the iterator at all.

[20:32] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] := (1,2).Slip; dd $_ for @a;

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «slip(1, 2)␤»

[20:33] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] := (1,2).Slip; dd $_ for @a.flat;

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «slip(1, 2)␤»

[20:33] <lizmat> hmmm

[20:34] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] := (1,2); dd $_ for @a.flat;

[20:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(1, 2)␤»

[20:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «((1, 2),).Seq␤»

[20:36] <gfldex> All cases without a Slip are correct. But they behave the same then with a Slip. So why have the Slip?

[20:36] <gfldex> Is there any use case where one would want to maintain the Slip?

[20:36] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] = (1,2).Slip; dd @a.map({$_})

[20:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(1, 2).Seq␤»

[20:37] <gfldex> At the other hand, if Slip works on array container assignment/binding one does not need splice anymore.

[20:38] <gfldex> m: my @a = [ (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) ]; @a[1] = (<a b>, <c d>).Slip; .say for @a;

[20:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(1 2)␤((a b) (c d))␤(5 6)␤»

[20:39] <lizmat> m: my %h; %h<a> = (1,2,3).Slip; dd $_ for %h<a>

[20:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤»

[20:39] <lizmat> m: my @a; @a[0] = (1,2,3).Slip; dd $_ for @a[0]

[20:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤»

[20:39] <lizmat> handy uses of Slip inside a Hash or an Array

[20:40] <lizmat> It feels like we could use more documentation, so perhaps make a doc issues ?

[20:40] <lizmat> *issue 

[20:42] <gfldex> I'm not conviced this is an ENODOC. Because I could not explain why it works for Hash-elements and List but not for Array.

[20:45] <lizmat> gfldex: so what is the difference in behaviour between List and Array ?
