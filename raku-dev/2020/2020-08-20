[06:43] <patrickb> sena_kun, nine: Is cleanup of https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3785 (no global precomp store lock) a blocker for the release?

[06:44] <patrickb> .tell pmurias If you find the time I'd value your insights on https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/656

[06:44] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to pmurias

[06:53] <nine> patrickb: I'll try to get it done today or at least tomorrow on my way to vacation

[06:53] <nwc10> closer than NZ this time?

[06:53] <nine> very much so :)

[06:54] <nwc10> St Polten? :-)

[06:54] <nine> Our plan for this year was Leogang in Salzburg from the start and it turned out to be a good pick

[06:54] <nwc10> oh, the other direction :-)

[06:56] <patrickb> nine: I didn't want to push, just make sure it doesn't pass by unseen and forgotten. Thanks for your work and have a relaxing vacation!

[07:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈2 days and ≈11 hours. 2 blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft
