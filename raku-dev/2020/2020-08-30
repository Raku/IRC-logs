[09:16] <JJMerelo> releasable6: status

[09:16] <releasable6> JJMerelo, Next release in ≈20 days and ≈9 hours. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[09:16] <releasable6> JJMerelo, Details: https://gist.github.com/e9de66f35ca85d6de9cd93d80b2147f8

[09:24] <JJMerelo> Daily reminder we're running a survey for Raku users. Please take some time to answer it https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRPBdn1iRN_sT8BMNMOBhVbEY1u8ngZWVwLyM37sqsa4OLwQ/viewform

[09:33] *** codesections left
[09:34] <JJMerelo> A few advances from the answers so far, almost half the people use copy/paste to write the Unicode symbols...

[09:40] <JJMerelo> And it looks like the percentage of people coming from Perl has actually *increased*

[09:48] <timotimo> did you know the end of the survey links you to the Raku/survey repo, but it's kind of outdated?

[09:50] <JJMerelo> I wondered where that was. Let me see if I'm able to edit that.

[09:50] <JJMerelo> And thanks.

[09:50] <timotimo> YW

[09:52] <JJMerelo> timotimo done. Also, too many "see"s there. 

[09:52] <timotimo> hm?

[09:54] <JJMerelo> timotimo "see" was repeated in a single sentence.

[09:55] <timotimo> sorry, where was that?

[09:55] <JJMerelo> Around the URL you mentioned above. Looks like nobody did actually *see* it :-)

[09:56] *** HarmtH joined
[09:56] <timotimo> i clicked the link too fast and didn't realize it'd navigate the tab

[09:56] <timotimo> then i couldn't navigate back

[09:56] <JJMerelo> I've checked the "answers can be edited" slot also.

[09:59] <timotimo> `gdb --args nqp -e ''` will let me run an empty nqp program no problem, but when i "run" or "start" again in the gdb commandline, i get moar's usage help because it doesn't recognize -e, even though it's supposed to be a flag to nqp, not moar

[10:02] <timotimo> seems to have to do with how the binary execs moar

[14:07] <thundergnat> gfldex: I would imagine so.  It's splitting on a junction so not a huge surprise it returns one.

[14:07] <thundergnat> to me at least.

[14:07] <thundergnat> m: my $s = 'a:b/c'; say $s.split(/':'|'/'/);

[14:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc75105fb: OUTPUT: «(a b c)␤»

[14:17] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar fc75105fb: OUTPUT: «(a b c)␤»

[14:18] <gfldex> i did the expect the same result as with a list of matchers

[14:20] <gfldex> if the current form is corrects it's an ENODOC as the docs states: "and splits it into pieces based on delimiters found in the string" 

[14:21] <gfldex> Based on that wording I expect to get a Positional in any case. (That Positional may be a single value tho.)

[16:50] <jdv79> was a pointy block ever a routine and not a block in history?

[16:51] <timotimo> committable6: releases say (-> { }) ~~ Routine

[16:51] <jdv79> for instance, at https://ajs.github.io/tools/blocks/ its described as a "pointy sub" and "anonymous routine"

[16:51] <committable6> timotimo, ¦releases (46 commits): «False␤»

[16:51] <jdv79> and for some reason that feels like it used to be true... idk.

[16:54] <timotimo> that would have been a time where for @foo -> $bar { return if $bar eq "hi" } wouldn't return from the containing routine, and also not terminate the loop

[16:54] <timotimo> we did have a time where many for loops would end up lazy on accident i guess

[16:56] <jdv79> maybe that's it

[18:42] <AlexDaniel`> jdv79: looks correct to me, it's not a routine. Same goes for using `return`, for example.

[18:43] <AlexDaniel`> like, if you want to return from a pointy block, turn it into an anon sub
