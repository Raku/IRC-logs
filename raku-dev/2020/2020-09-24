[15:06] <AlexDaniel> I ran out of inodes again

[15:06] <[Coke]> whoops.

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> I love this little trick of ‚Äújust write all your stuff into files, simple!‚Äù, especially when prototyping, but yeah‚Ä¶ sometimes it's not the brightest idea :)

[15:21] <sena_kun> yay

[15:21] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel++

[15:22] <sena_kun> So we need to test Test::Fuzz regression before release.

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: Introducing RakuAST::Deparse class

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: 

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - will be part of core, for now in lib for fast dev cycle

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - moved DEPARSE methods from src/Raku/ast here, as Raku instead of nqp

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - installed a RakuAST::Node.DEPARSE fallback that will invoke Deparse module

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - RakuAST::Deparse class with many settable attributes to control rendering

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - uses bindhllsym / gethllsym to let NQP know what to look for

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: - still many DEPARSE methods to port, but this is enough for today

[20:19] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/rakuast: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0ae5607284

[20:20] <lizmat> and that concludes my hacking for today&
