[00:32] <japhb> jnthn: Should be able to look at https://github.com/croservices/cro-core/pull/19 again.  It works, but I have a concern that my testing may have uncovered a bug outside my new code (I've worked around it in the tests, but that shouldn't be needed).  See PR comments.

[00:32] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to jnthn
