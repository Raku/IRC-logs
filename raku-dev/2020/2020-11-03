[10:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[10:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - move single dimension checking logic to dispatch

[10:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - de-nqpify code mostly

[10:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - working towards a deeper refactor of shaped array setup

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: Make DateTime.now 60% faster

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: 

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: - actually it's DateTime.new(epoch) that's 60% faster

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: - simply add the timezone value to the epoch before calculations

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: - no need to call .in-timezone afterwards

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: - also simplify the fast path on .in-timezone a bit

[17:42] <Geth_> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/53b558fe02

[17:50] <lizmat> actually, only 60% faster if you're not in UTC, otherwise minimally faster

[17:51] <lizmat> so I guess the UK / IE / PT are out of luck here
