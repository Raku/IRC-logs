[14:02] <[Coke]> we have a doc test that augments Str by adding Date; It is currently failing.

[14:03] <[Coke]> was trying to figure out if this was a change in Rakudo - doesn't look like it, and this test has been there since 2016, so something weird going on

[14:03] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3455

[14:06] <AlexDaniel`> [Coke]: yes, it's caused by a change in rakudo

[14:06] <AlexDaniel`> bisectable can reliably tell when something changed, that is as long as your question is correct

[14:07] <AlexDaniel`> when you don't know if it changed at all it's the wrong tool to use

[14:07] <AlexDaniel`> look at the output of committable, it gives the output on all releases, so it's much easier to see the picture

[14:08] <AlexDaniel`> after that it's easier to ask bisectable for the thing you're interested in by providing a narrower range

[14:08] <AlexDaniel`> so your answer is (2020-02-29) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d95d218f3192b06f0bb52bceb90e43d198747f09

[14:09] <AlexDaniel`> just always use committable first

[14:11] <AlexDaniel`> arguably bisectable6 and committable6 should trigger at the same time, or maybe both bots should be combined into one

[14:11] <[Coke]> ... this is why I asked someone else to do it. :)

[14:11] *** sena_kun left
[14:12] <AlexDaniel`> yes yes that's very nice, I'm just curious why timotimo triggered bisectable and then disappeared 😇

[14:13] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel`++

[14:14] <AlexDaniel`> I should really fix the user interface of the bots one day, people always use bisectable first which nowadays gives misleading results because the range is so wide (from 2015 to 2020)

[14:14] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel`: so if I had picked something that didn't *fail*, that would have been better, but since it just failed *differently*, that didn't help?

[14:14] <AlexDaniel`> maybe it's time to change the default

[14:15] <AlexDaniel`> [Coke]: generally, yes. Then it would've used the exit code, and bisecting by exit code is always more predictable than bisection by output (because any change in the error message will be considered different and as such “new”)

[14:16] <jnthn> Could bissectable always run commitable too, and if it changed more than once in the range of commits being considered, then it can say "oh btw, this result might not be what you want"

[14:17] <AlexDaniel`> jnthn: yeah, something like that, are we willing to wait though? :)

[14:18] <AlexDaniel`> that is, currently committable is testing 43 revisions

[14:18] <AlexDaniel`> and bisectable on average tests about 12 or 13 I think

[14:18] <AlexDaniel`> unless it hits a lot of unbuildable commits

[14:19] <[Coke]> (yay doc testing that found this was no longer a good example!)

[14:19] <AlexDaniel`> of course I can parallelize it but then perf bisection is at risk, which I used to do relatively often

[14:20] <jnthn> Ah, logarithms end up being too awesome once again... :)

[14:21] <jnthn> .oO( just bissect on the commitable release commits too )

[14:21] <AlexDaniel`> yeah, and committable is getting slower over time while bisectable is remaining the same

[14:22] <AlexDaniel`> because even doubling the amount of commits in the range will only require one more test, while committable will get twice slower. Logarithms are nice indeed

[14:24] <AlexDaniel`> hmmm

[14:24] <AlexDaniel`> jnthn: I mean… let's see if I can do it in one evening…

[14:25] <AlexDaniel`> I'll keep existing functionality the same but will add autobisect: feature

[14:32] <AlexDaniel`> ok I'll also change what bisectable does by default when you address it…

[14:32] <AlexDaniel`> or maybe what it does by default in general…
