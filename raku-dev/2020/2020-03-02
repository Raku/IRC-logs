[12:33] <tbrowder> .tell ugexe i'm having very strange results testing with yr suggested test for PERL6LIB but not with RAKULIB. for some reason, the experimental module is getting associated with the PERL6LIB test but not the RAKULIB test and it can't be found.m

[12:33] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[12:33] <tbrowder> i

[12:34] <tbrowder> sounds like a subtle rakudo bug that i haven't been able to isolate.

[12:36] <tbrowder> real world use of both vars works, but the test gives weird failure for PERL6LIB only. still debugging, though.

[12:48] *** leont joined
[12:48] <tbrowder> note the error is triggered by a "use experimental :cache" line in one of the roast helper modules. should we be using :cache in roast while it's experimental?

[13:51] <tbrowder> note thatreversing the order of  the vars in file "./src/core.c/CompUnit/RepositoryRegistry.pm6" doesn't affect the error

[13:52] <tbrowder> nor does removing the RAKULIB line
