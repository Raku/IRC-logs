[14:56] <Xliff> rba: What is the advantage of rakubrew over rakudobrew?

[14:58] <Xliff> Oh! Nevermind. LOL

[15:09] <[Coke]> Anyone have any pointers on .NET object model docs?

[15:21] <sena_kun> [Coke], other than the .NET spec?

[15:23] <[Coke]> I'll take anything.

[15:24] <[Coke]> trying to google that, I get the "standard" which appears to be API level.

[15:26] <sena_kun> [Coke], oh, wait, you want .NET including different things, CLR? Not e.g. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/introduction ?

[15:28] <[Coke]> that's better. trying to figure out how we could tie in 6model to that.

[15:28] <[Coke]> sena_kun++

[15:29] <sena_kun> [Coke], I think there was an attempt of .net raku compiler, no?

[15:29] <[Coke]> niecza, yes, it's an older model.

[15:29] <[Coke]> I am hoping we we can plugin a new backend to nqp

[15:31] <[Coke]> I think rakubrew is maintained and rakudobrew is not.

[15:31] * rba thinks this too

[15:31] <tellable6> 2020-11-24T03:41:17Z #raku <melezhik> rba, I don't mind to upgrade

[15:31] <tellable6> 2020-11-24T03:43:20Z #raku <melezhik> rba I see that brezleisen  is online, I can connect to ssh, thnaks

[15:54] <patrickb> Xliff: WRT upgrade path rakudobrew -> rakubrew: From the top of my head: Remove rakudobrew from path (and remove any hooking code there might be installed). Install rakubrew regularly. Determine its home dir `rakubrew home` and copy the rakudo installations over from your rakudobrew installation (they are located in a `versions` subdir).

[19:29] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: i think vrurg is the person to ask

[19:34] <vrurg> [Coke]: Yes, you need to.

[19:35] <[Coke]> ok, so have to deal with submodule "pain" as well if I'm going to tackle the project. OK.

[19:35] <[Coke]> danke.

[19:40] <[Coke]> ... wonder if to start it would make sense just to take over moarvm backend until codegen was at all working.

[19:42] <[Coke]> Yup, in way over my head. shame.

[19:54] <vrurg> [Coke]: It's not much you'd need to add to Configure.pm to add a new backend. Most of backend specifics are anyway located in tools/lib/NQP/Config/

[19:56] <vrurg> nqp-configure code mostly define prefixes/suffixes/names only.

[23:40] <melezhik> I finally added watcher script to rerun Sparky if it's crashed - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/watcher.sh , so RaluPlay should be (I hope) pretty stable now

[23:41] <melezhik> I had to do so, b/c Bailador gets crashed every few hours, next plan might be to rewrite Sparky on cro

[23:44] <timotimo> how does bailador crash? does it perhaps leak memory and gets OOM'd?

[23:46] <melezhik> I don't think so, but I don't have enough statistics for that, every time, I just rerun the service, the last one though was that - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/error.txt

[23:47] <melezhik> and my rakudo on the sparky worker server is pretty old ... -  2020.05 

[23:49] <timotimo> mhm, interesting

[23:50] <melezhik> timotimo do you need more details? I can grep code from  brezeleisen server ...

[23:51] <timotimo> sorry, i don't think i have access to brezeleisen?

[23:51] <melezhik> btw this error made all Bailador web app to stop (killed?) , I am curious if  cro  will survive that?

[23:52] <melezhik> I mean I can log in get a source code (for given stack trace ...)

[23:53] <timotimo> well, i believe cro has its very own http implementation

[23:53] <melezhik> yeah

[23:54] <melezhik> I particularly don't like the fact that some errors made web app stopped ...
