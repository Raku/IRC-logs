[07:59] <gfldex> adding symbols to a package at BEGIN time is not specced. Should it?

[08:02] <nine> I'm pretty sure that's an intended use case for BEGIN blocks

[08:04] <gfldex> I'm asking because my last blog post is largely unspecced. :)

[08:59] <Altai-man_> It seems there are some segfaults on master, as well as "normal" breakages. New Blin ticket is done.

[09:13] <nine> "Spit – Fail, Bisected: de6ebd4e7d432a5f4375e61e648b3ab12c915c16" that's...surprising considering that commit only changes some comments

[09:14] <nine> Btw. Blin results would be even nicer if they were grouped by identified commit

[09:18] <lizmat> Files=1306, Tests=111379, 216 wallclock secs (28.97 usr  8.46 sys + 3024.36 cusr 286.67 csys = 3348.46 CPU)

[09:18] <Altai-man_> Can simply search by sha on page if necessary. Most of are not so bad like list return type change.

[09:23] <nine> Sure I can search. Grouping would give a better overview though and one could see at first glance which regression has the most impact. But anyway, that's really just nit picking on an incredibly useful tool

[09:43] <Altai-man_> Agreed.

[09:50] <MasterDuke> huh. i just tried to do `raku -I lib t/http2.t` in a cro-http checkout, but it dies with `Error while importing from 'Cro::Uri': no such tag 'encode-percents'at /home/dan/Source/perl6/modules/cro-http/lib/Cro/Uri/HTTP.pm6 (Cro::Uri::HTTP):1------> ::Uri :decode-percents, :encode-percents⏏;`

[09:53] <Altai-man_> This is really weird... MasterDuke are you using master?

[09:53] <MasterDuke> yeah

[09:53] <Altai-man_> Is `-I lib` correct as well as `-Ilib`, I assume?

[09:53] <MasterDuke> is Cro::URI a separate module? should it be in the depends?

[09:53] <MasterDuke> yeah

[09:54] <Altai-man_> TIL

[09:54] <nine> Probably missing a version requirement in the dependency specification

[09:54] <Altai-man_> MasterDuke, can you try update Cro::Core?

[09:54] <MasterDuke> hm, zef says i have Cro::Uri installed

[09:55] <Altai-man_> Is included since 0.8.2.

[09:56] <MasterDuke> upgrading to 0.8.3

[09:57] <MasterDuke> ugh. this might be that mismatch between my system raku and locally built raku again

[10:35] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: I have to admit you were right, the commit SHAs need to be links, otherwise blin output pasted as a gist kinda sucks

[10:35] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: how do you run Blin?

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: I'm wondering why does it say 26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65 (26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65)

[10:42] <linkable6> (2020-06-13) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/26a7869b38 Bump NQP to get double-free fix

[10:43] <AlexDaniel> instead of HEAD (26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65)

[10:43] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, last time was simple `time podman run -ti -v /var/tmp/Blin-volume:/mnt myblin --old=2020.05.1 --new=26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65`.

[10:43] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: why not --new=HEAD ?

[10:44] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: also why provide --old and --new at all? :)

[10:44] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: old defaults to the last release

[10:44] <AlexDaniel> and --new to HEAD

[10:45] <Altai-man_> Because when something like a bump happens and I want to test exactly that, but I don't know is the build is here, I can run it with the commit I want and it dies if there is no build yet. But with HEAD I need to look at the output to make sure it decided HEAD is the commit I want.

[10:45] <Altai-man_> I know it is a rare case.

[10:45] <Altai-man_> And usually the builds are here, but I like it this way. The note of --old having default is very cool!

[10:46] <AlexDaniel> whatever makes you comfortable, it just triggers me that it says 26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65 (26a7869b38986dfde6558b7c433a74f857fffb65) xD

[10:46] <linkable6> (2020-06-13) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/26a7869b38 Bump NQP to get double-free fix

[10:46] <Altai-man_> I think I'll remove --old from now on, this seems handy. AlexDaniel++

[10:46] <AlexDaniel> I'll fix it now though

[10:50] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: any requests while I'm touching the code?

[10:51] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, grouping by commit was requested above, I think. Not sure how should it really look like, though.

[10:51] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: but it's already grouped?

[10:54] <AlexDaniel> nine: please submit things like this as tickets, I love nitpicking :)

[10:55] *** sena_kun joined
[10:55] <AlexDaniel> nine: grouping is already there, but sorting is not which is maybe why you didn't notice grouping :)

[10:57] *** Altai-man_ left
[10:57] <AlexDaniel> nine: you want what, biggest regressions to come first? Or last?

[10:57] <AlexDaniel> if they're first then you'd need to scroll down for everything else, if they're last, then… hmm

[10:59] <AlexDaniel> MissingDependency Whateverable

[10:59] <AlexDaniel> huh!

[11:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: by any chance do you know which one is it?

[11:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: like in the json output, or something?

[11:02] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, let me see...

[11:04] <sena_kun> ugh

[11:04] <sena_kun> "version": "1.0.9"

[11:04] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't include warnings in json output? I see

[11:05] <sena_kun> Possibly.

[11:25] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: it's kinda weird… locally I tried to install `sake` and it works, but Travis and Blin both seem to be unhappy about it because zef fails to install it as a dependency. I don't remember now, but I think there was some kind of bug or something

[15:55] <MasterDuke> if i run `zef list --installed`, and some modules are found in ~/.raku and some are found in my --prefix directory, how do i know why some are in ~/.raku ?

[15:57] <MasterDuke> is it just finding things that have been precomped? i.e., the things in ~/.raku are just modules i've used when doing a `-I <something>` vs `zef install <something>`

[16:13] <nine> No, we actually can't enumerate precomp cache contents
