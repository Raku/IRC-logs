[14:42] <[TuxCM]> I could reboot. I have pending changes that require a reboot

[14:43] <timotimo> a new hash implementation was merged a few hours ago

[14:44] <timotimo> you have the high enough moar version

[14:46] <nwc10> I don't know how to read those numbers

[14:47] <Altai-man> 1.9 plus-minus something is what we had before for test-t.

[14:47] <nwc10> it's slower. that's not allowed!

[14:48] <nwc10> that's strange. It should be faster, all things being equal.

[14:53] <[TuxCM]> I'll reboot and re-run to see if that helps

[15:24] <timotimo> hm, a wider spread, but not necessarily better?

[15:25] <[TuxCM]> maybe "stuff" was starting in the background. I did do a reboot :)

[15:25] <[TuxCM]> anyway 1.824 is not spectacular

[15:30] <[Coke]> :(

[15:31] <Altai-man> That's a bit lower than what we usually see, though. Not a _huge_ difference, yes.
