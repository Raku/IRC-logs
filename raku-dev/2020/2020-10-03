[10:02] <bartolin> it would be nice to get a second pair of eyes for https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/674. (Mostly for the added tests -- I'd dare to merge the code changes without a review, because it only affects the JVM backend.)

[10:02] <bartolin> Related to the added tests: I'd be interested to know if the example code for nqp::decodertakeallchars from https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/6278#issuecomment-699689933 is supposed to work or to fail. (I think it might be a good addition to the test file.)
