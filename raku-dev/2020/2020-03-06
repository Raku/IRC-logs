[13:01] <timotimo> none of the talks jnthn gave appear on the uni erlangen video portal? :(

[13:03] <lizmat> that's correct: he needs to sign the release before they're publoc

[13:04] <lizmat> which is now extra difficult as he's not at the workshop today on account of coming down with something

[18:28] <timotimo> any particular recommendations? i already saw liz' talk

[18:38] <japhb> The lightning talk on GDPR & location-based games was interesting.  I didn't expect that people would be able to get TSVs of every user table that way.

[18:39] <japhb> moritz++ did one on rationalist fiction, though it's introductory so there won't be much for people who are already fans.

[20:30] <moritz> deep dives aren't best material for lightning talks :D

[20:41] <japhb> True ...

[20:42] <japhb> I just wanted to warn the folks who might have been looking for "You've read the top few, what's next?" because that was not your topic.

[20:42] <japhb> (I'd be interested in what you had to say about that, though.  :-) )

[20:52] <moritz> japhb: have you read What Lies Dreaming?

[20:52] <moritz> http://whatliesdreaming.com/

[20:54] <moritz> otherwise I have read about half of the top 20 of https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction

[21:00] <japhb> Kinda surprised Mother of Learning isn't on that list

[21:02] <japhb> (It's number 8 on http://topwebfiction.com/, along with some you mentioned)

[21:04] <japhb> Or Worth the Candle, though that's "rational, rationalist, and very genre aware characters in a LitRPG world" which is definitely a niche within the larger genre

[21:05] * japhb adds What Lies Dreaming to his list
