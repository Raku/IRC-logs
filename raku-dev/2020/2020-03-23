[00:01] <MasterDuke> but i have to get to bed. hopefully can pick this up tomorrow evening

[00:11] <AlexDaniel> ok actually it is fixed: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3564

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> or so it seems

[00:14] *** Xliff left
[00:16] *** hungrydonkey joined
[00:26] *** Xliff joined
[00:30] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: you're right, but I was able to reproduce and even bisect it to a bump that fixes some segfault. It's very unlikely that the situation is different than I make it out to be :)

[00:31] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: OK. However, there could have been a situation where the problem was the input file.

[00:31] <Xliff> Was just trying to cover the bases.

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> yes, you're right, it's sometimes very frustrating when your ticket is closed as resolved and you update in a few weeks to see that it was actually not :(

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> but then again, I was able to reproduce it even with a different file :P

[00:33] <Xliff> Yes, and I just wanted the original file... so THERE! :p

[00:34] <Xliff> Great taste! Less filling! New file, old coke! =)

[00:34] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: I'm bored. Find me a project....

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: cool, we need Blin to generate proper tickets

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku-dev?date=2020-03-22#l44

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: ticket example: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3553

[00:36] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: basically a github-flavored markdown todo list, one line per bisected module

[00:36] <Xliff> Geee.. having NEVER seen the Blin source, that's a helpful suggestion! :P

[00:36] <Xliff> Seriously, where in Blin would I start?

[00:36] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: there's just one file :D https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/master/bin/blin.p6

[00:37] <AlexDaniel> well, there are two other files too, but this one does almost everything

[00:37] <AlexDaniel> don't know if it makes you feel better or not, but it does relieve some cognitive load for me

[00:37] <Xliff> I see two more that could be problematic.

[00:38] <Xliff> If it's not all in that one file, I am coming for all of your bots.

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> haha

[00:38] <Xliff> As in ALL YOUR BOTS ARE BELONG...

[00:38] <Xliff> You get the idea.

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: well, one is just a class: https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/master/lib/Blin/Module.pm6

[00:39] <AlexDaniel> and the other one is for running stuff, you don't need it

[00:39] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: here's where it creates files with stuff: https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/b495ad0342bb91c172521b0dc5d38de990fa8225/bin/blin.p6#L361-L443

[00:39] <AlexDaniel> just add more code :)

[00:42] <Xliff> Does blin create the ticket?

[00:43] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: no, the ticket is created manually, and that's what we're trying to solve

[00:43] <Xliff> OK, so this is not as simple as you had be believe, you swindler.

[00:43] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: you don't need to make it create a github ticket via API, just creating a file with nice content should be enough

[00:44] <Xliff> OK, I can't read minds. 

[00:44] <Xliff> It seems like there is more to this than a simple pointer to an IRC chat would have lead me to believe.

[00:45] <Xliff> I thought you just wanted me to add "https://modules.raku.org/dist" to ever module that was not of status OK

[00:45] <Xliff> And now you are mentioning "files with nice content". o_O

[00:45] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: here's what Blin outputs right now: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/bfe7920a9ea1fd7b86e8e6106283a79c (4 files in that gist)

[00:45] <Xliff> Where does that content come from?

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: when Altai-man creates a ticket on github (like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3553), they probably grep the `overview` file for ‚ÄúBisected‚Äù and then manually add links to modules

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> then add a bit of markdown so that it's a todo list

[00:47] <Xliff> Then it sounds like Altai-man needs to speak up and add his input.

[00:48] <Xliff> Tell you what, create a ticket for this under Blin so that you and sena_kun can nail down what you want, and then I'll write it.

[00:48] <Xliff> Let me know the issue number.

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: just make it generate a useful plaintext file that can be copy-pasted as a github ticket

[00:49] <Xliff> "generate a useful plaintext file" of what?

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> you'll need to be able to run blin to test it

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> PERL6LIB=lib bin/blin.p6 --old=2018.06 --new=2018.09 Foo::Regressed Foo::Regressed::Very Foo::Dependencies::B-on-A

[00:49] <Xliff> Is that a workable line?

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> yes

[00:49] <Xliff> One sec.

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> installation instructions here: https://github.com/Raku/Blin#installation

[00:51] <Xliff> OK. FWIW.. I do this, and you become a p6-GTK tester flunky for 3 weekends! :D

[00:51] <AlexDaniel> what's GTK

[00:51] <AlexDaniel> :P

[00:51] <Xliff> :P

[00:52] <Xliff> Don't play ignerant now BotBoy... =)

[00:52] <Xliff> http://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> haha

[00:52] <Xliff> Odd...

[00:52] <Xliff> `zef install HTTP::Status` is returning errors.

[00:53] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[00:53] <AlexDaniel> that's not my fault

[00:53] <Xliff> Yeah, but that's a Blin dependency. Ooops! It won't work now. I flee! 

[00:53] * Xliff fleas

[00:54] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: what's the error?

[00:55] <Xliff> [HTTP::Status] Could not find HTTP::Status in:

[00:55] <Xliff> So it's not running tests on the installed version of HTTP::Status

[00:55] <Xliff> Or not installing HTTP::Status.

[00:55] <Xliff> I can `raku -Ilib t/01-basic.t` and it's fine

[00:56] <Geth> ¬¶ Blin: AlexDaniel assigned to Xliff Issue Blin should automatically create useful content for github tickets https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/22

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: just force it?

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> --/test or --force

[00:57] <Xliff> Yes, I can. Would rather fix the problem.

[00:57] <Xliff> Especially since Blin depends on it.

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> there's a ticket https://github.com/supernovus/perl6-http-status/issues/15
