[09:53] <Kaiepi> IO::Address::IPv4, IO::Address::IPv6, and IO::Address::UNIX need gist methods of some sort, but i'm not sure what they should be because of IO::Address::UNIX

[09:55] <nine> Kaiepi: doesn't an IO::Address::UNIX have a path?

[09:55] <Kaiepi> it can either be a path or a Blob[int8] that may not encode as a string, to allow abstract UNIX sockets to be used on Linux

[09:58] <timotimo> so utf8-c8 then?

[10:00] <Kaiepi> ohh right, that exists

[10:00] <Kaiepi> IP addreses could just use their URI format, and UNIX socket addresses could just use their path string then

[10:01] <timotimo> you can urlencode anything that doesn't map right to utf8

[15:37] <lucasb> is the release missing from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases ?

[15:46] <JJMerelo> lucasb which one?

[16:01] <JJMerelo> So, may I interest anyone  in writing a (short) article for the 20th aniversary of Raku https://github.com/Raku/advent/tree/master/20th?

[16:11] *** patrickb left
[16:12] <leont> If I didn't already have a surplus of ongoing blogging efforts (but I promise some of them will be Raku)

[16:14] <JJMerelo> leont that's a short article. And diving into old RFCs is a lot of fun

[16:24] <leont> What is the deadline?

[16:25] *** sena_kun joined
[16:26] *** Altai-man_ left
[16:27] <JJMerelo> leont the sooner, the better, but it must definitely be written before let's say Aug 7th

[16:30] <leont> Currently half-way through the list. There's one that I feel I could write something interesting on.

[16:30] *** Altai-man_ joined
[16:33] *** sena_kun left
[16:34] <leont> RFC22 almost has my name on it, primarily because there are very few people who actually understand smartmatch in both perl and raku

[16:34] <leont> Also, rfc329 has nine written all over it

[16:35] <JJMerelo> Please claim it. It's all yours.

[18:43] <tbrowder> leont: i just replied to the getopt::long issue

[18:45] <[Coke]> is t/spec/S17-procasync/kill.t a known failure on macos?

[18:45] <sena_kun> [Coke], is it persistent or a flapper?

[18:45] <sena_kun> It is a known flapper. If it is persistent for you, then wow.

[18:46] <[Coke]> It failed in 'make stresstest'. it failed again when I ran it with make.

[18:46] <[Coke]> let me run it a few times

[18:47] <[Coke]> passed 3/11 times

[18:47] <sena_kun> That's pretty heavy for a flapper, but.

[18:48] <sena_kun> Not sure I can help more here.

[18:48] <[Coke]> no worries, just didn't know if it was a new one.

[18:48] <[Coke]> haven't run even spectest in a while, just did a stresstest.

[21:44] <[Coke]> is there a todo to rename the .pm6 files in the rakudo repo to .rakumod?

[21:51] <lizmat> I think there is, but please note that jnthn would like that to coincide with the merging of RakuAST 

[21:51] <lizmat> it should make life easier in the intermediate, if setting files could co-exist, I guess

[21:56] <[Coke]> Just curious, did some updates to the raku-docs, and noted that we weren't eating our own dogfood yet. rename should be pretty easy, we can do it after jnthn's done with his work, np

[21:57] <lizmat> I've done the modules in lib

[21:57] <lizmat> because that was easy to do

[21:58] <lizmat> also, renaming files now would basically invalidate all outstanding PR's  :-(
