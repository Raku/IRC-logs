[12:13] <moritz> sena_kun: that's my domain, akshually

[12:24] <sena_kun> moritz, I see. Well, I was going to buy rakubooks.com but then thought we have (or supposed to have) an organized common infrastructure point for making such things, so pinged rba.

[12:58] <sena_kun> rba, hey! Hopefully you are doing well. I have maybe 2 things to ask about: 1)the blin server can likely be used for Rakudist and for whatever projects need it, as I now run blin on my hardware; 2)about raku-books.org above, I'd like to contribute to buying this domain and join it to existing infra, what should I do?

[12:58] <sena_kun> Oops, *raku-books.com

[13:10] <rba> sena_kun: 1) The blin server is used for blin and for rakudist.

[13:12] <rba> sena_kun: 2) Domain topic: You may buy it yourself or if it’s a page from communty interesst, I could do it and add it the oraganisation at gandi I have all these domains for raku. Or if you want just the dns server and/or the page hosted we can just add them.

[13:13] *** yuplushi left
[13:14] <rba> 2) Or you may use books.raku.org, maybe?

[16:05] <MasterDuke> [TuxCM]: those aren't great numbers. under load?

[16:17] <timotimo> Altai-man: i seem to recall there used to be a link to full blin output in the reports, is that gone? can i see how exactly the different modules fail, like the flappers and such?

[16:28] <Altai-man> There was no such link, but I can provide you whole output, want some?

[16:30] <Altai-man> timotimo, https://clbin.com/YtA1F <- enjoy

[16:32] <timotimo> ah, that's raw :)

[16:32] <Altai-man> Well...

[16:33] <timotimo> aaahaha, it's a frickin null byte in the name of the distribution

[16:33] <timotimo> that's brilliant, i love it

[16:44] <Xliff> How did that get there, I wonder?

[16:46] <timotimo> i assume it's part of the group of modules designed to cause insufficiently careful ecosystem-handling tools to break loudly, so they can be fxed

[16:46] <timotimo> we have some that depend on each other circularly, for example

[18:09] <gfldex> While we are on the subject of the ecosystem. Would it be reasonable to ask jonathanstowe to hand over control of META6 and Test::Meta to raku or raku-comminuty-modules?

[18:10] <gfldex> Both modules are kinda blockers for changes to the ecosystem.

[18:12] <lizmat> gfldex: is RabidGravy not open to pull requests and such ?

[18:13] <lizmat> I thought they were pretty responsive usually?

[18:19] <[Coke]> +1 to leaving things out of raku-community whenever possible.

[18:35] <Xliff> gfldex: He's not as active as he once was.

[18:35] <Xliff> .seen RabidGravy

[18:35] <tellable6> Xliff, I saw RabidGravy 2017-12-17T01:40:19Z in #perl6: <RabidGravy> that's https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/something-about-messaging-but-i-couldnt-think-of-a-snappier-title/ if you want to get in early

[18:35] <Xliff> Er sorry... I meant lizmat

[18:37] <lizmat> meant me in what sense?

[18:53] <MasterDuke> lizmat: i assume "He's not as active as he once was." was meant as a reply to "is RabidGravy not open to pull requests and such ? I thought they were pretty responsive usually?"

[18:55] <lizmat> aaah... ok

[18:55] <gfldex> I got a PR open right now. So I will be able to report in a few days.

[20:27] <ggoebel> are the ecosystem-handling tools documented anywhere in one place?

[20:27] <tellable6> 2020-09-12T11:04:03Z #raku <JJMerelo> ggoebbel Not finished yet, and I don't want to skew responses by posting them; however, in a day or two I will probably close it and post results at the p6-survey repo.

[20:32] <ggoebel> .tell timotimo are the ecosystem-handling tools collectively documented anywhere in one place? If so, would mention of that in rakudo repo's CONTRIBUTORS.md be welcome? Noting that only the rakudo repo has a CONTRIBUTORS.md... would the rakudo docs subdirectory be the place to put an ecosystem-tools.md?

[20:32] <tellable6> ggoebel, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[20:32] <gfldex> ggoebel: what is documented can be found at https://docs.raku.org/language/modules

[20:33] <gfldex> ggoebel: I would not spend much time on improving it. Most of the ecosystem is in need of improvement.

[20:36] *** domidumont left
[20:37] <ggoebel> gfldex: I was thinking of ecosystem as being more expansive than modules. Things like blin, ci, things that generate reports, summaries, and statistics, etc. 

[20:39] <ggoebel> is it documented anywhere how one would hand over control of a module to raku or raku-community-modules?

[20:42] <lizmat> AlexDaniel` might know

[20:42] <MasterDuke> ggoebel: ask JJMerelo, he just transfered some to raku-community-modules from somebody, i forget who

[20:42] <timotimo> interesting idea

[20:42] <tellable6> hey timotimo, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/c39a1a91167709e866dce25947d8d846

[20:46] <timotimo> a relatively wide net could be cast to catch stuff that interacts with the ecosystem

[20:46] <timotimo> for example, the whateverable bots have one that will search through all modules

[20:50] <ggoebel> .JJMerlo Thank you for doing the survey. -MasterDuke mentioned you helped someone transfer some of their modules to raku-community-modules. Is that process documented anywhere?

[20:51] <MasterDuke> ggoebel: you probably want to `.tell JJMerelo <...>`

[20:53] <ggoebel>  .JJMerelo Thank you for doing the survey. -MasterDuke mentioned you helped someone transfer some of their modules to raku-community-modules. Is that process documented anywhere?

[20:53] <ggoebel> thx.

[20:53] <ggoebel> .tell JJMerelo Thank you for doing the survey. -MasterDuke mentioned you helped someone transfer some of their modules to raku-community-modules. Is that process documented anywhere?

[20:53] <tellable6> ggoebel, I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[20:58] <AlexDaniel`> if you have write access in the community-modules org you should be able to transfer

[20:58] <AlexDaniel`> I did my best to autoinvite everyone to the org, so it should just work for most people

[20:59] <AlexDaniel`> ggoebel: arguably tools should be in the ecosystem too, in App:: namespace

[21:00] <AlexDaniel`> that doesn't always happen and sometime there are reasons for that

[21:00] <AlexDaniel`> sometimes* :)

[21:00] <ggoebel> regarding ecosystem... looks like "there is a repo for that" https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem 

[21:01] <timotimo> yeah that's where the list of urls to meta.json files lives

[21:02] <timotimo> there's a place that collects all these and makes one big json file out of the contents

[21:04] <ggoebel> AlexDaniel: where is community-modules? how does a new contributor get invited? I've looked at https://docs.raku.org/language/modules and  https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem but I'm missing any mention of raku-community-modules or community-modules...

[21:04] <timotimo> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/ - this here

[21:04] <AlexDaniel`> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/

[21:05] <ggoebel> thx

[21:05] <ggoebel> timotimo: so ecosystem in this context is very module specific

[21:05] <AlexDaniel`> ggoebel: I can invite you, but can you please check https://github.com/Raku/please-turn-off-the-autowatch-feature

[21:06] <AlexDaniel`> ggoebel: because sometimes people are very unhappy when they get autosubscribed to hundreds of repos :)

[21:17] <timotimo> ggoebel: ah, yes, i was specifically only referring to "all the modules we have publicly listed" i guess

[21:21] <ggoebel> AlexDaniel: done. thx
