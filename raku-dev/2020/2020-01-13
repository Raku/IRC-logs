[11:19] <Altai-man_> cherry-picked the fix commit. as soon as there will be a fix for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/63f117502a93b44f12d97898eb3438417996793a and Module::Toolkit failure, November failure and ADT failure, we're ready for a release.

[11:27] <lizmat> Altai-man_: what did that commit break ?

[11:27] <Altai-man_> lizmat, constant::overload module

[11:28] <lizmat> overload::constant ?

[11:29] <Altai-man_> oops, yes

[11:29] <lizmat> looking at it now

[12:22] <lizmat> Altai-man_: I have *no* idea what is causing the error: all calls to `return` in that section of code, have been wrapped into a `try` already  :-(

[12:22] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[12:40] <sena_kun> :S

[12:40] <tellable6> 2020-01-12T20:05:40Z #raku-dev <nine> sena_kun: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9fa82b80aafd16553e9afeff64082825ae987f72 is definitely recommended for the release. It fixes a critical issue with ~0 chance for a regression.

[12:40] <sena_kun> this is sad

[12:57] <AlexDaniel> it's alright :)

[12:58] <AlexDaniel> eventually we'll get the release out

[17:13] <nine> As commit 63f117502a93b4 is a performance improvement, we could just revert it on the release branch and figure out how it breaks that module on our own time without release pressure
