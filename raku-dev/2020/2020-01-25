[11:40] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: This commit bumps NQP to remove that hack, and introduces a HLL

[11:40] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Match.Int that will make sure it won't descend into the depths of

[11:56] <lizmat> only 400 more files to go

[12:19] <sena_kun> does anyone here run stresstest? more or less often

[12:22] * lizmat runs a *lot* of spectests, but no stresstest

[12:22] <sena_kun> I think we have an issue then

[12:22] <sena_kun> because I see hangs on stresstest, but spectest is just ok

[12:22] * lizmat starts one

[12:23] <sena_kun> I am running one from b787095358bcbac4c6326b99e9673e54ef5afd58 and t/spec/S17-promise/nonblocking-await.t is dead

[12:28] <sena_kun> t/spec/S17-promise/nonblocking-await.t ............................ ^C

[12:28] <sena_kun> Test run interrupted!

[12:28] <sena_kun> All tests successful

[12:28] <sena_kun> ok, this is... odd.

[12:34] <lizmat> no hanging for me

[12:36] * sena_kun tries again

[12:36] * lizmat needs to be afk, probably for the rest of the day

[15:06] <lizmat> sena_kun: is there something I can do for you in the next 30 mins or so ?

[15:20] <nine> sena_kun: I seem to remember nonblocking-await.t being troublesome from time to time

[15:28] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3441 looks like a monster to me and is reproduced consistently for me even using master branches for everything. at the very least, it would be very cool if anyone could run releasable script to try out if it is something local or not.

[15:31] <lizmat> sena_kun: confirmed the hang

[15:31] <sena_kun> passing stresstest at some point just stops (usually it is the file specified, I got it a couple of times in a row, so not a rare flapper), stops eating CPU

[15:31] <sena_kun> lizmat: really? with sake all?

[15:32] <lizmat> raku t/spec/integration/advent2011-day07.t  after checking out the 6.c-errata branch

[15:32] <sena_kun> hmm, I used zscript and it passed, I think

[15:33] <sena_kun> bisect comes to the rescue...

[15:33] <lizmat> found the reason for the hang

[19:12] <sena_kun> .tell rba hi! Can I use the blin-intended server for running spectest on various rakudo checkouts? That'll greatly help with releasing process, cause right now I am kind of short on computing resources. I started to setup a setup using rakudobrew && z script combo, but need some things (for example, make) to make things working. My questions are: 1)can I use the blin server this way? 2)can you help with setting up dependencies (at leas

[19:12] <sena_kun> t making sure rakudobrew build moar passes)?

[19:12] <tellable6> sena_kun, I'll pass your message to rba
