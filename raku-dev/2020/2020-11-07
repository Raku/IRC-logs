[13:43] <nine> not ok 1 - Property: General_Category=Cn from file: extracted/DerivedGeneralCategory.txt (Correct: 830645 Wrong: 5957). Todo'd if <= 78 failures.

[13:43] <nine> oh, I think, I forgot to recompile MoarVM...

[13:46] *** domidumont joined
[14:22] <nine> no that's not it

[14:37] <nine> I only got a single known problem with in-process precompilation left. It's one of Inline::Perl5's tests complaining about X::Inline::Perl5::NoMultiplicity not being known.

[14:37] <nine> Perl6::ModuleLoader.merge_globals doesn't see a reason to merge the X from the comp unit into the existing X, because it's the same. Which makes sense, as X probably gets reposessed into the comp unit.

[14:39] <nine> Actually it shouldn't get repossessed: that's one big change i made. Replace repossession of extended pre-existing stashes by generated code that will add the missing entries on load

[14:41] <nine> Ooooh...it gets registered as Inline::Perl5::X::Inline::Perl5::NoMultiplicity

[14:42] <nine> Actually that's even how it's supposed to be, as class X::Inline::Perl5::NoMultiplicity is declared inside unit class Inline::Perl5

[14:42] <nine> So it's a classic "how the hell has this worked before?!"

[14:49] <nine> All tests successful.

[14:50] <MasterDuke> very cool

[14:51] <timotimo> heck yeah

[15:00] <nine> on to zef...
