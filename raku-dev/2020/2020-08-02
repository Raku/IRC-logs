[01:02] <vrurg> tbrowder: I have doubts about 'Test::Misc'. If it's only two modules to use the sub, I'd rather use a dedicated subdir under packages/

[01:02] <vrurg> *two tests

[07:14] <JJMerelo> Second entry for the 20th anniversary calendar, by moritz++ https://raku-advent.blog/2020/08/02/rfc-112-by-richard-proctor-assignment-within-a-regex/

[07:14] <tellable6> 2020-08-01T20:42:45Z #raku-dev <vrurg> JJMerelo I hoped so much to evade it. But seemingly, it's my doom... :D

[07:15] <JJMerelo> .tell vrurg a short article will do :-)  Pick your RFC!

[07:15] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to vrurg

[08:13] *** sena_kun joined
[08:14] *** Altai-man_ left
[08:22] <JJMerelo> And we still need new entries for the 20th anniversary calendar. Any new candidates? Pick a RFC, talk about it and how it got baked into Raku. The example above, by moritz, is excellent
