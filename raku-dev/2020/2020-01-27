[09:40] <lizmat> oddly enough, System::Passwd appears to be fixed for me now

[09:40] <lizmat> perhaps it was also a Supply.first issue

[09:41] <linkable6> AlexDaniel, 21 hours, 57 minutes, and 26 seconds, 283.503906MiB maxrss. This is Rakudo version 2019.07.1-94-gd1f9d2848 built on MoarVM version 2019.07.1-50-gb614a7b4d implementing Perl 6.d.

[09:41] <lizmat> and Sys::Lastlog cannot build on MacOS  :-(

[09:41] <sena_kun> >This module is not compatible with the operating system void

[09:41] <sena_kun> okay

[09:41] <lizmat> "[Sys::Lastlog] This currently does not work on darwin"

[09:42] <sena_kun> let's see blin logs, maybe it was wrongly bisected...

[09:42] <sena_kun> seems like it

[09:42] <sena_kun> This module is not compatible with the operating system debian

[09:44] <sena_kun> hmm

[09:44] <lizmat> sena_kun: have to be afk for a few hours&

[09:44] <sena_kun> lizmat: sure, take care

[09:44] <sena_kun> I think we can ask jonathanstove about these

[09:50] <sena_kun> bisectable6: say $*KERNEL.Str

[09:50] <bisectable6> sena_kun, Bisecting by output (old=2015.12 new=57dbc35) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[09:50] <bisectable6> sena_kun, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/b26339855c3a50cb426e83c283178dd7

[10:06] <sena_kun> bisectable6: say $*DISTRO.Str;

[10:06] <bisectable6> sena_kun, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=57dbc35) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[10:06] <bisectable6> sena_kun, Output on both points: «debian␤»

[10:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 57dbc3588: OUTPUT: «linux␤»

[10:10] <sena_kun> so .name gives correct result (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Kernel.pm6#L61), https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/57dbc35/src/core.c/Systemic.pm6#L13 returns $!name, but somehow it is not initialized at start

[18:15] <patrickb> rba: I think the thing listens to localhost *inside* the container, which is pretty much useless.

[18:15] <patrickb> With that change it works fine on my local machine.

[18:29] <rba> patrickb: Did you rebuild the container?

[18:30] <rba> patrickb: I will reboot my machine first.

[18:32] <patrickb> I pushed a change to the repo that makes it default to 0.0.0.0. But you can just do the export and it should work with a non-rebuilt container as well.

[20:20] <patrickb> rba: The -v option to docker/podman binds in an external directory that should contain the release files. No need to change anything about the container when doing a release. Just drop in a new folder in the bound directory and it should be recognized.

[21:30] <MasterDuke> ++ to lizmat who pretty recently passed jnthn to become the top contributor to rakudo by number of commits

[21:32] <sena_kun> Agreed, lizmat does incredible amounts of work. Hopefully she finds enough time to rest and keep burnout away.

[21:34] <sena_kun> rba: are you still around?

[21:35] <rba> sena_kun: Yes sir :-)

[21:36] <sena_kun> rba: I am running `scp nqp/nqp-2020.01.tar.gz [email@hidden.address] and nothing happens, at the previous attempt I got `ssh: connect to host rakudo.org port 22: Network is unreachable`

[21:36] <sena_kun> how can I help to help with this? :)

[21:40] <AlexDaniel> most probably your key is not there

[21:41] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: this one is yours? https://github.com/Altai-man.keys

[21:41] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: yes

[21:41] <AlexDaniel> rba: ↑

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> or, hm…

[21:42] * sena_kun vaguely remembers the keys being delivered there, but not really sure

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> I also can't get to that machine

[21:42] <sena_kun> s/not really/not 100%/

[21:43] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: oh shit

[21:43] <sena_kun> hmmm?

[21:43] <rypervenche> The port isn't listening, it sems.

[21:43] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: can you comment out line 137 in the sakefile?

[21:43] <rba> s/@rakudo.org:/@lavm-perl6infra-1.atikon.io:/

[21:43] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: the one with nqp-upload rakudo-upload

[21:43] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: `rakudo done`? eeeh?

[21:44] <AlexDaniel> sorry, 136

[21:44] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: nqp-upload rakudo-upload? what it'll give me?

[21:44] <rba> sena_kun: rakudo.org points to the ip of cloudflare. l avm-perl6infra-1.atikon.io is the hostname of the webhost.

[21:44] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: hold on, actually I think it succeeded and you don't need to do anything

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: it probably failed trying to upload stuff but we don't do that anymore… sorta

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: at least I didn't do it for the last release

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> because, yes, I have it deleted and I didn't commit that change :D

[21:45] <sena_kun> well, it failed anyway

[21:45] <rba> AlexDaniel: For rakudo releases patrickb has renevated the rakudo.org site.

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: it didn't really fail, it pushed everything and stuff

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> it just didn't upload tars but we kinda stopped doing that, we need to start doing it again but for now don't worry

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> rakudo-done is just a message saying you're done :)

[21:46] <sena_kun> well, I read that, I mean, yes-yes, the pushes are ok, but I still do need to upload tarballs, right?

[21:47] <sena_kun> that's what I am going to do using the correct host?

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah you can do that but in my book congrats for getting your first release done \o/

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun++

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> rba: so where should we upload the tars now, remind us? :)

[21:48] <sena_kun> >ssh: connect to host lavm-perl6infra-1.atikon.io port 22: Network is unreachable

[21:49] <patrickb> o/ 'night everyone!

[21:51] * sena_kun still has to upload tarballs, update releases page a couple of times, update wiki page

[21:51] <sena_kun> rba: the same result. :(

[21:51] <MasterDuke> rakudo hasn't had the final version bump yet, right?

[21:51] <sena_kun> it did

[21:51] <sena_kun> the branch is not merged yet though

[21:51] <MasterDuke> ah, ok

[21:51] <sena_kun> I think we can merge it though

[21:52] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: I am assuming we can, can't we?

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah, you decide which direction you merge it

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> but if it's just 8 commits I guess it doesn't really matter :)

[21:53] <sena_kun> rba: sorry to disappoint, but... no luck. :S

[21:54] <rba> sena_kun: Grr. Ok. Will start reading logs. Sorry for letting you do try-and-error.

[21:54] <sena_kun> no problem, that's quick for me here...

[21:55] * sena_kun proceeds to the github-release.p6 script

[21:58] <rba> sena_kun: please try: scp -P 2222 nqp/nqp-2020.01.tar.gz rakudo.org@lavm-perl6infra-1.atikon.io:public_html/downloads/nqp/

[21:59] <sena_kun> yay

[21:59] <sena_kun> it worked out. \o/

[22:00] <sena_kun> now have to do the same thing with rakudo one...

[22:00] <rba> sena_kun: uppercase -P

[22:02] <sena_kun> rba: can you check if the uploads look ok?

[22:03] <MasterDuke> lizmat: now that the rakudo release has happened, i'd like to get my libtommath v1.2.0 moarvm pr merged soon. we'd chatted about changing the expmod roast tests and making some more specific error messages in the moarvm function

[22:03] <rba> sena_kun: checking...

[22:04] <MasterDuke> however, i have some questions about that. you mentioned including the bad value in the message (which i agree would be good, i love adding context to error messages). but we're talking about possibly big integers

[22:05] <MasterDuke> should i only include the value if it's actually a small int, or go though the potentially expensive process of turning a big int into a string

[22:05] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: what about something like this? https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/blob/af31cc5129211f4311a8d039dc02cfa2f355224d/lib/Whateverable/Bits.pm6#L30-L32

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> this can come in handy for other error messages too

[22:07] <MasterDuke> also, there are a bunch of other moarvm big integer functions that now can throw exceptions, not just expmod (expmod only got the extra attention because the bad tests actually triggered the new exception)

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> it's very simple but the behavior is extremely nice, in my opinion. For anything that's not too long it just prints it fully, but for anything really long it gives a very short string with “…”

[22:07] <MasterDuke> should i do the same work for all of them?

[22:07] <MasterDuke> and if so, should it be part of the initial pr? or a second follow-on one

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I'd prefer to merge it sooner so that it's more tested

[22:08] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: that could help, but there would still be the non-zero cost of determining how big the string would be

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: don't they have some kind of quick checks in libtommath?

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> like the number of bits or whatever

[22:09] <rba> sena_kun: Files are here. Where can I find the public key for the signature?

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> it'd be a rough estimate but maybe that's good enough

[22:09] <MasterDuke> not in 1.2.0. some have been added or are in the process of being added

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> sure, then it won't be a nice function that can be used for other non-int exceptions… but still

[22:10] <MasterDuke> i think the bits is a really dramatic difference. i.e., a small change in the number of bits can result in a really large size increase. so the threshold using bits might have to be lower than we'd want

[22:11] <MasterDuke> but i'm not 100% sure

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: but mp_count_bits was there like since the beginning?

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> the implementation looks fast to me

[22:13] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i also vote for merging the pr pretty much as is after changing the roast tests and then doing cleanup after

[22:14] <MasterDuke> it might be good enough, sure

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> oh but then we can't stringify partially, right?

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> so it'd have to stringify it fully anyway even if you don't print it

[22:16] <MasterDuke> correct, not now/yet

[22:16] <MasterDuke> some of the stringification work that's happened/happening since v1.2.0 might make a fast partial stringification possible, don't remember

[22:17] *** Kaiepi left
[22:17] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I also see mp_radix_size

[22:17] <MasterDuke> right now it's really really slow

[22:18] <sena_kun> ok, github release is done, wiki article is updated, tarballs are updated

[22:18] <MasterDuke> sena_kun++

[22:19] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: upload moarvm releases to github too

[22:20] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: "github release is done", no? :)

[22:20] <sena_kun> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/releases and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: but https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> it's kinda not your job but you have the script and access :)

[22:20] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: this one is bad, because I don't have assets. :S I thought about that, but decided to leave it as is.

[22:20] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: yeah, but I don't have access. :S

[22:21] <sena_kun> ouch

[22:21] <sena_kun> *assets

[22:21] <rba> sena_kun: Do you know where the public gpg is for the signature files?

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: https://moarvm.org/releases/

[22:21] <sena_kun> oh, with this it'll work out...

[22:22] <sena_kun> thanks for all the guidance and help!

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> thanks for doing it :)

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> you did great, btw

[22:23] <sena_kun> well, except for making some wrong assumptions at the beginning which made the process much more troublesome for lizmat++ which I am sorry about

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> robertle: oh, by the way

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> robertle: what do I do to tell you that the signature for nqp and rakudo releases changed?

[22:24] * sena_kun .oO ( other than that goblins are much more troublesome than releasing compilers )

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: you need to upload your key to https://pgp.mit.edu/

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> your public key of course :)

[22:27] * rba found sena_kun's key on https://github.com/Altai-man.gpg

[22:27] <AlexDaniel> OH THEY FINALLY DID IT

[22:27] <AlexDaniel> used to be you had to look through the api https://api.github.com/users/Altai-man/gpg_keys

[22:28] <sena_kun> >Key block added to key server database.   New public keys added:

[22:28] <rba> uploading makes sense, so packager can verify the signature too.

[22:32] <sena_kun> moarvm releases are updated

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: nice! email?

[22:33] <rba> sena_kun: was so free to add nqp-2020.01.tar.gz.asc

[22:33] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: erm, email, eeee. how is this called again.

[22:33] <rba> all signatures look fine.

[22:33] <AlexDaniel> yep I checked too, looks fine

[22:33] <sena_kun> d'oh, I didn't update that. :S sorry...

[22:33] <sena_kun> nqp's .asc, I mean

[22:34] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: here's a funny detail. If you sign your mail, then it'll show up like this: https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/2019/11/msg18340.html

[22:34] <AlexDaniel> that is, without body

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> if you don't, then, well, your mail is unsigned

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> feel free to do whatever, we can't win in this case anyway :D

[22:35] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: right now I know that I don't know a thing about how to do release announcement.

[22:35] <sena_kun> and guide says nothing about that. :S

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: remember the announce file, right?

[22:36] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: this one: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/announce/2020.01.md

[22:36] <sena_kun> yes

[22:36] <AlexDaniel> you copy paste it as your message

[22:36] <AlexDaniel> with the first line going into your subject instead

[22:37] <AlexDaniel> it's number 20 in the release guide

[22:38] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: am I sending raw markdown version or?

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I don't know

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I think I used to send it as plaintext

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> or as htmlfied plaintext

[22:38] <lizmat> sena_kun: you did great!

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> also, you're free to change the title to “Announcement:” :D

[22:39] <lizmat> don't let my grumpiness on Monday morning distract from that  :-)

[22:39] <sena_kun> let's go with markdown raw one then...

[22:39] <AlexDaniel> that's something both Zoffix and I wanted to change, but didn't :D

[22:39] * rba is feeling the party time is comming...

[22:39] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yeah, that's pretty cool

[22:40] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: and it feels like the bus factor got a bit better too :)

[22:40] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: next

[22:40] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ⚠🍕 Next SQUASHathon in 4 days and ≈5 hours (2020-02-02 UTC-12⌁UTC+20). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[22:40] <lizmat> indeed.. bus++

[22:40] <sena_kun> lizmat: just have to do something with a feeling I torture people because of choosing a wrong commit as a release one

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I'd say you'd be torturing people one way or another

[22:41] <sena_kun> I am sending a plain email (no signing) to [email@hidden.address]
[22:41] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: remember we torture the implementors *on behalf of the user*, not just for fun

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: speak for yourself :D

[22:42] <rba> AlexDaniel: Just curious, where is this release checklist?

[22:42] * MasterDuke also speaks for the trees

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> rba: one is here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> rba: there are separate files in MoarVM and NQP, and in Star too

[22:43] <MasterDuke> but not the dead

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> rba: and if it feels like some of these actions can be automated, then you're right, they are indeed! https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/tools/releasable/Sakefile

[22:44] <rba> AlexDaniel: Where is this feed https://rakudo.org/news comming from?

[22:45] <rba> rba: Guess here: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/tree/master/post

[22:46] <AlexDaniel> yeah, looks so

[22:46] *** sena_kun left
[22:46] <AlexDaniel> can I move that repo btw?

[22:46] * AlexDaniel moves

[22:46] <AlexDaniel> ah wait

[22:46] <AlexDaniel> I don't know *where* to move it

[22:46] <AlexDaniel> that's why it's not moved

[22:46] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: thoughts?

[22:46] <rba> Yes you can, I just need to ajust it on the webhost.

[22:47] * rba scratches the back of his head

[22:47] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: currently it's MoarVM/moarvm.org vs perl6/rakudo.org

[22:47] <AlexDaniel> I'd say in Raku org more people will be able to work on it, but uh… I don't know

[22:47] <rba> AlexDaniel: Give me a shout before you hit the move button...

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> I hate separate orgs with passion anyway so don't take my opinion seriously :)

[22:48] <lizmat> $ raku -v

[22:48] <lizmat> This is Rakudo version 2020.01-14-g0d530092f built on MoarVM version 2020.01.1

[22:48] <lizmat> implementing Perl 6.d.

[22:48] <lizmat> whee!

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> rba: well, not like it's going to break or something

[22:49] <rba> AlexDaniel: It might break the cron-sheduled auto-update. This is simple to fix.

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> yeah, it's a good idea to change links

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> but it's not strictly necessary

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what should we do about the squashathon?

[22:50] <lizmat> well, this weekend is *also* FOSDEM

[22:51] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: does it mean it's good or does it mean it's bad? :)

[22:51] <lizmat> on Friday afternoon Wendy and I will br bringing stuff to Brussels

[22:51] <lizmat> on Sat I'll be doing other stuff

[22:51] <lizmat> and on Sun we'll be at FOSDEM again

[22:51] <lizmat> so don't expect much from me 

[22:52] <lizmat> also: jmerelo will also be at FOSDEM, and he has more travel time than we do

[22:52] <AlexDaniel> ok, so we move it to the next week?

[22:52] <lizmat> I guess some other potential squashathonners will also be at FOSDEM

[22:52] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: the idea was to work on RT tickets

[22:52] <lizmat> yeah, and then I can announce it in the RWN  

[22:53] <lizmat> RT tickets?  do we still haz them?  :-)

[22:53] <lizmat> but yeah, sounds like a good idea

[22:53] <AlexDaniel> which is a simple and potentially fun task, but maybe it's not attractive enough to be inviting people on fosdem and stuff

[22:54] <lizmat> yeah... for people knowing what Raku is about, yes...

[22:54] <lizmat> for noobs, not so much

[22:55] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: status

[22:55] <lizmat> so, is it ok to tweet about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/announce/2020.01.md ?

[22:57] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yeah

[23:00] <sena_kun> lizmat: yes, I already twitted.

[23:01] <sena_kun> https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/ is not updated (well, almost) immediately, is that normal?

[23:02] <lizmat> yeah, it may take a few hours, in my experience

[23:03] <sena_kun> ok

[23:03] <sena_kun> and I must go to bed in 15 minutes, IT for some teeth brushing for me now. :)

[23:06] <lizmat> good night!   sena_kun++

[23:16] <rypervenche> Do the downloads on https://rakudo.org/downloads need to be updated manually?

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> rypervenche: these are binary releases, there's no binary release for 2020.01 yet

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> rypervenche: it's a new thing so it's not part of the release process yet

[23:24] <rypervenche> Gotcha. I'm very new to this as well. Just trying to help in case things were missed.

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> rypervenche: ah, also that page was updated recently

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> it's the first time I see it live :)

[23:31] *** lucasb left
[23:32] <rypervenche> Oh, interesting. My zef-installed modules weren't recognized with 2020.01. I had to move my ~/.perl6 to ~/.raku . I suppose that's a good thing.

[23:33] <rypervenche> I was confused for a second though.
