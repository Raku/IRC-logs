[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: 

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: Fix some of the expected failures. This should result in the tests now

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: all passing, instead of having some of them pass with TODO's.

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: 

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: I have also made the debug mode much better. It will now tell you what

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: it expected and what it actually got for that codepoint.

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: 

[22:42] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: Fixed some <= that should have been <, and vice versa.
