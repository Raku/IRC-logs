[10:56] <nine> Regarding problem-solving 191, isn't the obvious answer a simple "yes"? When would we ever not want to detect an issue as early as possible? Surely this isn't a question of "what do we want?", i.e. problem-solving material but "how can we get it?", i.e. a plain rakudo issue.

[11:07] <AlexDaniel> PS#191

[11:07] <linkable6> PS#191 [open]: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/191 [rakudo] Should Rakudo fail at compile time if it's possible?

[11:41] <nine> I just love the Open Build Service. Not only did it take just a couple of clicks to get testing on ARM and PPC, it's also quite trivial to do this locally:

[11:41] <nine> nine@sphinx:~/install/build/home:niner9:rakudo-git/perl6-Inline-Perl5> osc build --vm-type=qemu --no-verify openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC   ppc64

[11:41] <nine> This also means that I can debug the issue that those tests uncovered further and test fixes without having to upload somewhere

[11:42] <AlexDaniel> niiice

[12:15] <nine> Ah, C...where char is always signed, except for platforms where it isn't...

[18:57] <[Coke]> JJ had some specific plans about the redirect, I think. I would love it if the redirect was transparent, set an http header or something, and we could use that to display a "please update your link" alert.
