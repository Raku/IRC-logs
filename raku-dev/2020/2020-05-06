[11:13] <jjmerelo> On second thoughts, maybe I'll just leave it there, deprecate it and start a new one in Raku that does the same thing better

[15:16] <nine> If you ever find yourself in need of bisecting rakudo, this may give you a head start: https://gist.github.com/niner/3059e4fe8284d94fd6d3cc504cbb00b3

[15:16] <nine> Using that with git bisect run and it contains workarounds for various changes in our build system last year

[15:24] *** robertle joined

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> nine: alternatively just use Blin

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> nine: something like

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> PERL6LIB=lib bin/blin.p6 --old=2018.06 --new=2018.09 --custom-script=testsomethinghere.p6

[16:14] <AlexDaniel> obviously doesn't work on windows and other platform, but at least you don't need to wait for rakudo to build :)

[16:14] <AlexDaniel> nine: also this way you can also specify module dependencies and it'll install them and test them too

[16:16] <AlexDaniel> but your script is nice too, +1 for 125-ing correctly :)

[16:16] *** sena_kun joined
[16:16] <AlexDaniel> maybe a good idea to add `perl6 -e 'say 42'` as a test too
