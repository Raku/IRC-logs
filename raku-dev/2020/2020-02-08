[12:54] <releasable6> sena_kun, Next release in ≈14 days and ≈6 hours. 2 blockers. 0 out of 88 commits logged

[12:54] <releasable6> sena_kun, Details: https://gist.github.com/cc1047286ba78af8722aef609e6d1a5b

[13:00] <sena_kun> .tell lizmat Pakku failures are, in fact, blin issues, not rakudo. Pakku is an alternative to zef and is not indented to be installed as blin tries to install it, hence the failure. we may either extend blin to run custom scripts or do something else, but that's not a regression.

[13:00] <tellable6> sena_kun, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[13:02] <sena_kun> I'll also run the test suite and blin tomorrow to check if the current cut is ok not to put off the blockers on the last time
