[13:20] <Guest4508> why does this work? ^^

[13:23] <jnthn> To allow representing years BC as well as AD, at a guess...

[13:23] <jnthn> Glancing the implementation, it looks intentional rather than accidental.

[13:27] <Guest4508> aha, perhaps that is according to the standard

[13:33] <lizmat> yeah, the minus for years is explicitely allowed
