[14:28] <patrickb> rba: I have a testing installation running here: https://rooster.uber.space

[14:30] <patrickb> It reads release files from a folder. That folder defaults to 'releases' in the projects directory. One can pass in a different folder via the RAKUBREW_ORG_RELEASES_DIR env var

[14:31] <patrickb> The thing can be run in a podman/docker container. It's necessary to mount in the folder with the release files in them for it to have much use

[14:31] <patrickb> podman run --rm -p 10000:10000 --volume=[/releases/folder/on/host]:/releases:ro rakubrew.org

[14:31] <patrickb> the README.md has the full instructions of how to start it in a container

[14:35] <rypervenche> Oh, I thought rakubrew was only for Mac (thinking homebrew). This is nice. Good for testing things against different rakudo versions. :)

[14:37] <patrickb> rba: I think I successfully changed the nameservers.

[14:38] <patrickb> rba: I also have rakudobrew.org lying around. We could just as well make that a redirect to rakubrew.org. What do you think?

[14:40] <rba> patrickb: Yes, make it a redirect.

[14:40] <rba> I haven't started with installing docker/podman on the host we run our website currently.

[14:40] <patrickb> rba: It works just as well without a container, so no need to actually use it in a container...

[14:41] <rba> It's still old school there with one nginx, just added differnt users for diffent websites.

[14:41] <rba> patrickb: Yet, very cool that's also prepard for docker already. We like to do this for all websites.

[14:42] <patrickb> I'll change the nameservers for rakudobrew.org as well.

[14:42] <rba> Ok. I will add rakudobrew.org as well.

[15:33] * patrickb is away for a while too now

[15:48] <Kaiepi> i figured out my use of &now to generate timestamps is one of the main bottlenecks when generating traces with Trait::Traced. will nqp::p6box_n(nqp::time_n()) generate accurate timestamps on its own, or do i need to use Rakudo::Internals.tai-from-posix on top of that?

[17:30] <japhb> Kaiepi: What do you mean by "accurate" in this context?

[17:31] <japhb> So yeah, "now" has been leap-second corrected.

[17:31] <Kaiepi> m: use nqp; say now - Rakudo::Internals.tai-from-posix: nqp::time_n(), 0

[17:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar b291fc78a: OUTPUT: «Instant:-0.002102779␤»

[17:31] <Kaiepi> looks like i need Rakudo::Internals.tai-from-posix then

[17:32] <japhb> It's annoying how slow it is to grab a timestamp.  :-(

[17:32] <Kaiepi> doing it this way removes up to 60ms of overhead from tracing routine calls

[17:34] <Kaiepi> where i need to shave off as much time as possible, otherwise threaded code won't get traced accurately

[17:34] <japhb> Yeah, I pretty much use nqp::time_n anytime I need to get timestamps often (several per second or more)

[18:42] <TreyHarris> It seems to me like a number of questions recently on Raku/doc and on p6-u are due to (or at least, exacerbated by) newbies seeing routine/ autogenerated pages as a good place to get the "gestalt" of a routine, and it really isn't. But there's no other good place, à la perlfunc, either

[18:44] <TreyHarris> I'm wondering if adding to the autogeneration a dedicated pod that would be included in routine/ autogeneration prior to any snippets pulled from class documentation, and could discuss the overall purpose of the routine, would be sufficient. I think it would definitely be helpful
