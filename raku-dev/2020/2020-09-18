[08:16] <Xliff> What's the best way to find the calling ROUTINE of a method or sub?

[08:16] <Xliff> This is probably better for #raku, so moving it there.

[11:03] *** sena_kun joined
[11:04] <nwc10> are you storing a bitmap for all integers? or just odd integers? I'm not *great* at reading NQP code, but as I don't see special case handling for 2, I think you're storing all of them

[14:48] <lizmat> because on that line we established that it's odd ?

[14:51] <[Coke]> by the logic -on the previous line-, yes. :)

[14:51] <[Coke]> so it reads off by one to me. As long as it was intentional, that's fine.

[14:52] <[Coke]> 43 ballots, about 2 days left to vote.

[14:53] <[Coke]> I'm going to post the results back to the repository - I'll leave it to the community to "announce" them.
