[08:24] <lizmat> Files=1334, Tests=113514, 236 wallclock secs (30.28 usr  8.71 sys + 3263.88 cusr 319.33 csys = 3622.20 CPU)

[08:24] <lizmat> I hope this is a fluke, but it looks like we've lost quite a bit of performance again  :-(

[08:29] <Altai-man> Let's see csv bench.

[08:51] <lizmat> Altai-man: that's a different benchmark from running tests

[08:52] <lizmat> feels more we lost a few msecs at each startup

[08:52] *** oddp left
[08:54] <Altai-man> Indeed.

[09:11] <Altai-man> Files=1334, Tests=113514, 87 wallclock secs

[09:11] <Altai-man> Numbers between runs differ a lot here, so cannot confirm. :(

[09:13] <jnthn> 87 secs o.O

[14:25] <[Coke]> jjmerelo: I owe you an article, planning to finish it after I get out of $dayjob today

[14:25] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[14:25] <[Coke]> ... oh, that looked like it just happened, didn't realize it was 4 hours ago. :)

[14:25] <[Coke]> oops. :)

[14:25] <[Coke]> tellable6++

[14:33] <jdv79> the scoping rfc advent thing reminded me - could we add a "no strict" variant of -e for one liner terseness?

[14:33] <jdv79> maybe -E?

[14:40] <AlexDaniel`> make it truly a language for funky one-liners? :)

[15:43] <lizmat> jdv79 this has been discussed in the past, and decided against

[15:48] <jdv79> i don't remember but ok

[15:49] <lizmat> $_ is defined and assignable

[19:27] <jdv79> lizmat: i guess that's good nuf as long as one remembers.  when i'm in one liner mode i tend to think in Perl.
