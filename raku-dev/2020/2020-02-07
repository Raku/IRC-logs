[13:48] <[Coke]> nine: that code is very old, relatively.

[13:50] <nine> Proper handling of ressources has been there for 4 years now.

[13:52] <[Coke]> yah, this looks like it's from '14.

[13:53] <[Coke]> Thank you for the tip, I'll see if I can fix it.

[13:58] *** patrickb joined
[14:05] <patrickb> ping rba

[14:17] <[Coke]> nine - looks like when you run p6doc the first time, it tries to build an index for later use. I assume we're going to want to do that at install time, not at first run time.

[14:19] <nine> definitely

[14:20] <rba> patrickb: ping back

[14:20] <nine> A good assumption is that after installation you're never ever allowed to write to the file system again. After all it's a doc _reader_

[14:23] <patrickb> rba: https://patszim.volans.uberspace.de/patcloud/index.php/s/qmkreEJLQDZcjbf now contains a rakubrew-1.tgz with a new release. Can you put them on rakubrew.org?

[14:23] <rba> patrickb: I'm doing it right now.

[14:24] <patrickb> :-) Thanks!

[14:24] <[Coke]> nine: :)

[14:24] <[Coke]> My biggest concern is that we will have to manually update META6.json with our list of doc files to install. (but we can write a test for tit.)

[14:24] <[Coke]> *it

[14:27] <rba> patrickb: I put the 1 into the release directory. May you please let me know what you're testing now?

[14:27] <rba> patrickb: 1=v1 ?

[14:27] <patrickb> rba: Looking good. :-)

[14:27] <patrickb> Yes

[14:28] <patrickb> The website already shows it at the top

[14:28] <patrickb> nine: Did you see my comment on this PR: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1228

[14:28] <rba> patrickb: Is this just a incremented version based on the directories? 

[14:29] <patrickb> rba: Yes. It determines the version number based on the directory name.

[14:29] <patrickb> So each new version will be a new directory with the number increased.

[14:29] <nine> patrickb: oh...yes, makes sense

[14:36] <patrickb> rba: Is there some way I can put the release fiels on the server myself?

[14:39] <rba> patrickb: I'm working on this. rakubrew.org is my pilot project, where I try to manage all with the docker containers. This needs some more work from my side, which I hope to do in the next few weeks. 

[14:40] <rba> patrickb: I guess I will try to sync the docker volume which contain the persistent data for the container. Alternatively we can glue the data in a container as well.

[14:41] <patrickb> Can you do another upload in 15 minutes or so?

[14:43] *** hungrydonkey joined
[14:45] <[Coke]> looks like we still have to move stuff around. now instead of trying to fake moving doc into lib/, we have to actually move doc files in resources/

[14:57] <rba> Patrickb: sure

[14:59] <rba> patrickb: Will be back in front of my notebook in 30 mind. 

[15:01] *** hungrydonkey left
[15:02] <[Coke]> nine: yup, that's possible. Just trying to get one single file to install and work and then will clean it up.

[15:02] <[Coke]> I don't think resources/ existed at the time.

[15:03] <nine> Sounds like p6doc really needs a do-over to arrive in the post 6.c release time

[15:03] <nine> Also explains why I feel like p6doc is always trying to fight the system instead of using it

[15:05] <[Coke]> have a bin that is just dd'ing %?RESOURCES - it returns Nil both installed and locally.

[15:06] * [Coke] tries to do a zef uninstall and not just install over the existing install to see if that helps

[15:06] <nine> %?RESOURCES is not a Hash

[15:07] <nine> But it also shouldn't just be Nil if you have resources defined in your META6.json

[15:07] <[Coke]> ah, you have to know the specific resource you're asking for?

[15:08] <[Coke]> I do have a single resource in META6.json, yes.

[15:08] <nine> It's a Distribution::Resources object

[15:08] <[Coke]> I am still getting Nil, though.

[15:10] <[Coke]> heh. the docs in language/modules specifically say: "through the %?RESOURCES Hash"

[15:11] <nine> docs are wrong

[15:12] <[Coke]> Yes, that's what I'm saying.

[15:15] <[Coke]> Do we have any docs somewhere on Distribution::Resources? (not mentioned in p6doc)

[15:16] <[Coke]> do you have to be in a module for %?RESOURCES to work? I was just dumping it from a bin/foo 

[15:16] <nine> yes

[15:17] <[Coke]> Ok.

[15:43] <patrickb> rba: Thanks!

[15:44] <patrickb> With that I'm now inviting everyone to give rakubrew a try and give feedback what works and what is broken: https://rakubrew.org/

[15:44] <patrickb> It should work on MacOS, Windows and about everything else that has perl installed.

[15:45] <nine> [Coke]: no, they have to be listed

[15:46] <patrickb> I'm especially interested in MacOS testers, as I don't own a MacOS machine to test myself.

[15:47] *** Kaiepi joined
[15:47] <[Coke]> nine - cool. I have the bare minimum here that installs a single pod6 file in resources and then dumps it out based on %?RESOURCES. Should be able to use this as a basis to fix the installer.

[15:47] <[Coke]> Thanks for the help. I will no doubt have more questions later. :)

[17:43] <[Coke]> is there an easy way to remove all files installed with zef? I have a local p6 install, a zef on top of that, and want to just wipe everything so I can be sure I'm starting with a clean slate (trying to avoid having to re-install raku, but I can do that if it's the easiest)

[17:45] * [Coke] will just nuke everything for right now

[17:45] <nine> [Coke]: rm -rf ~/.perl6 and $RAKUDO-INSTALL-DIR/share/site

[17:46] <[Coke]> nine++

[17:48] *** sena_kun joined
[17:55] <rypervenche> Or ~/.raku if you're on 2020.01 or later.

[17:55] <nine> Wait, what?

[17:56] <[Coke]> when I am running 'zef install', is it going to ~/.raku or $RAKUDO-INSTALL-DIR ?

[17:56] <[Coke]> I imagine switching that is going to break a lot of people who upgrade

[17:57] <nine> Yep, that's a clear regression that slipped through :(

[17:57] <rypervenche> Am I wrong? When I installed 2020.01 it defaulted to using ~/.raku, even though I had modules in ~/.perl6. I had to delete the newly-created ~/.raku and move ~/.perl6 to it to get my modules back.

[23:22] <jnthn> Ah, it's busted

[23:22] <jnthn> I suspect https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/blob/develop/mp_prime_is_prime.c#L26 filters out the 1 and 2 cases though

[23:22] <jnthn> ohh

[23:22] <jnthn> And it doesn't check the sign bit in that shortcut

[23:24] <jnthn> https://github.com/libtom/libtommath/commit/a218ddce9ba3b61a69a90db9f7dc86642667a41d added the shortcuts
