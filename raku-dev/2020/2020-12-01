[06:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: with multiple different toolchains for the same OS.

[11:56] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[11:56] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: If it's a type or literal, we don't need to do a full smartmatch.

[11:56] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Unfortunately this isn't dramatically faster, since the primary cost is

[11:56] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: in generating a Backtrace for the Failure created when a case doesn't

[20:34] <timotimo> what's this about, correctness or performance?

[20:34] <nine> performance

[20:36] <dogbert17> nine: does t/spec/integration/advent2012-day21.t hang for you?

[20:41] <timotimo> that seems counter-intuitive

[20:48] <dogbert17> offending commit seems to be 260f015888c7

[20:48] <linkable6> (2020-12-01) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/260f015888 Merge pull request #4026 from MasterDuke17/gen_faster_code_for_some_given_when_cases

[21:04] *** morayj joined
[21:06] <nine> timotimo: as we discussed in #moarvm, MVMIter is surprisingly slow, as it doesn't JIT as well as manual atpos. atpos gets devirtualized as does the shift on the MVMIter, but the latter then does an MVM_repr_at_pos

[21:07] *** sena_kun joined
[21:07] <nine> And the result of nqp::shift has to be booleanized for the loop

[21:09] *** Altai-man left
[21:19] <timotimo> ah, mhm

[21:19] <timotimo> should be possible to devirt the shift on the iterator at the very least

[21:29] <vrurg> sena_kun: are you around by occasion?

[21:34] <sena_kun> vrurg, yes

[21:34] <sena_kun> not for long, though

[21:39] <nine> timotimo: possible, yes. OTOH simply not using iterators gives the same performance benefit :)

[21:41] <vrurg> sena_kun: can you have a look at https://github.com/Raku/roast/issues/707 when have type? Looks like rakudo archive is bundled with outdated roast.

[21:41] <timotimo> mhm

[21:44] <sena_kun> vrurg, during release roast is checked against master, 6.c-errata and 6.d-errata for number of times and it passes.

[21:45] <vrurg> sena_kun: it passes, but what we have in the archive is passing with TODOs. I thought these were un-todoed by lizmat before the release.

[21:45] <vrurg> sena_kun: I mean, nothing terrible, but a little bit not ideal. :)

[21:46] <sena_kun> Sorry, don't really have time to think about it now. :S

[21:46] <sena_kun> I'll try to look at it tomorrow.

[21:47] <vrurg> sena_kun: no problem whatsoever. Just a note.
