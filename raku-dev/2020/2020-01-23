[19:01] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: it signs them, but I can't get past this perl error. :S

[22:03] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: sorry, a false ping, I was kind of confused when roast tests kind of got ahead of rakudo branch I am trying to release from. Resolved that (hopefully) giving some older roast commit, but while you're here, I also see I don't have write access to roast repo, which is... I don't think I really need that, but it won't hurt, I think.

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> hhmmmmmm

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> how is that possible

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> ah

[22:03] <sena_kun> so if you're the right person

[22:03] <sena_kun> I mean, latest roast tests don't pass on my branch

[22:04] <lizmat> sena_kun: guilty as charged

[22:04] <sena_kun> and I was like "Damn, so what are we doing when rakudo SUDDENLY doesn't pass roast, let's ping and ask", and then "Oh, so the roast was updated, and those files are failed, I see".

[22:07] <sena_kun> oki, thanks!

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: also, once you run human-upload it will fail, I've always considered it a feature but you can fix it

[22:08] <sena_kun> erm, what?

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: thing is, it's using https:// links to rakudo and nqp repos, so once it attempts to `git push` it will fail

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: so you just go to nqp/.git/config and rakudo/.git/config and fix the upstream urls

[22:08] <sena_kun> hmm, so I am doing pushes to the branch manually?

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> and then run human-upload

[22:09] <sena_kun> I see

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> it's a bug, sure, but I see it as a safety switch :)

[22:09] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: what are the correct urls? :)

[22:09] *** toddr joined
[22:09] <AlexDaniel> anything that'll let you push, [email@hidden.address] and [email@hidden.address]
[22:10] <sena_kun> ok, thanks

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: then there's also a small thing which is this page: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases

[22:10] <sena_kun> the files for github release druft are generated?

[22:10] <sena_kun> yes, was going to ask about that

[22:11] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: if you look here the last releases are displayed a bit incorrectly: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases

[22:11] <AlexDaniel> there's a script to do that, let me find itâ¦

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: oh it's this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/tools/releasable/github-release.p6

[22:12] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: so no need to do UI github buttons thing at all?

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> yes, no need

[22:12] <sena_kun> I see, thanks

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> and we can do it tomorrow no biggie

[22:13] <sena_kun> will see how fast I"ll get the tarballs

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> I just gave you admin access to MoarVM/MoarVM

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> I had it by accident but it was extremely useful and needed

[22:14] <AlexDaniel> so should make your life easier too, at least write access will, e.g. for creating pretty moarvm github releases

[22:15] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: the script does all three?

[22:15] <sena_kun> repos, I mean

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> yep

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> it can do any repo, but you'll need to run it with the right args

[22:15] <sena_kun> >t/spec/S17-supply/comb.t                                        (Wstat: 1024 Tests: 46 Failed: 4)

[22:15] <sena_kun> NO NO NO NO NO

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> ./github-release.p6 --repo=MoarVM/MoarVM --tag=2019.11 --token=3b6997d336ea187f3d4c096402030f5afd92b584 --asset=MoarVM-2019.11.tar.gz --asset=MoarVM-2019.11.tar.gz.asc

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> oh shit

[22:15] <sena_kun> don't tell me this 6 days ago commit wasn't old enough...

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> fuck I just had to delete all my tokens because I'm an idiot

[22:16] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: they are kind of private, right. :S

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> /github-release.p6 --repo=rakudo/rakudo --tag=2019.11 --token=3b6997d336ea187f3d4c096402030f5afd92b584 --announcement=../../docs/announce/2019.11.md --asset=rakudo/rakudo-2019.11.tar.gz --asset=rakudo/rakudo-2019.11.tar.gz.asc

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> so, like this

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> and yeah now it doesn't matter :(

[22:17] * sena_kun appreciates all the help

[22:18] <toddr> FYI the first round of talk acceptance for TPRC::NA is Sunday - https://www.papercall.io/tpcihcfp

[22:18] *** |Tux| joined
[22:20] <AlexDaniel> I had just three tokens and they were not labeled nicely

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> so it's totally my bad that now I had to trash all of them

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> good news is that according to security log nobody was able to take advantage of it in these 35 seconds :)

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> and more good news is that the new release manager is almost certainly not as dumb as me :)

[22:29] <sena_kun> well, what the new release manager knows is that a5af083cd5c54c4aaa328f3ce1b2793a06fa4df0 was not old enough, trying out b425a4b31fb36b91bbac15e5d63b992f6acf5bc1

[22:34] <patrickb> .tell tony-o Is there any write up or source for how zeco works with git repos? I'd be interested how it deals with versions of modules.

[22:34] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tony-o

[22:34] *** patrickb left
[22:39] <TreyHarris> Anyone know the status of doc redesign? The last update I can find on GitHub Raku/doc is from last August, but I've heard discussion suggesting it's still in progress, so I'm guessing it's just happening somewhere else?
