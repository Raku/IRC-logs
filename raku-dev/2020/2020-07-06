[01:54] <timotimo> how am i supposed to see how much slower multiplying by a power of two number is compared to bit shifting when 10 million times 64 times doing the thing finishes in a quarter of a second

[16:54] <[Coke]> lizmat: should the word wrapper be there when the message is *emitted*, or when it is *printed* ?

[16:55] <[Coke]> Seems like the latter would mean you didn't need to remember to include a call to the wrapper in each .message

[16:55] <lizmat> I looked at "printed", but there's too much going on with respect to stack traces

[16:56] <lizmat> some exceptions don't lend themselves to being wordwrapped, or the logic should become much more convoluted
