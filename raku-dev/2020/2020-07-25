[12:30] <AlexDaniel`> lizmat: huh! not sure how to fix that. It's cool that it's parallelized and stuff, but yeah, that output isn't very readable :D

[12:31] <lizmat> it told me what I needed to know  :-)

[12:34] <AlexDaniel`> yeah

[12:34] <AlexDaniel`> but I guess I should hide bisect logs into the last gist

[12:35] <AlexDaniel`> that'd make the output a bit cleaner
