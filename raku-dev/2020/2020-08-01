[21:01] <vrurg> .ask tbrowder Does S26-documentation/12-non-breaking-space.t supercedes S26-documentation/11-non-breaking-space.t? Perhaps it worth removing the latter altogether?

[21:01] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[21:13] *** camelCaser joined
[21:27] <tbrowder> vrurg: the 11- addressed the original issue and 12- was created later to check all the non-breaking spaces after i realized the possible future problems. at the least, it should be added to if you want to consolidate it. i'll defer to others if you want to remove it altogether, but i think existing precedence at the time was keep a test for a specifidly12 even if it checks the same

[21:27] <tbrowder> p

[21:27] <tellable6> 2020-08-01T15:40:34Z #raku-dev <JJMerelo> tbrowder you can take your time... not later than Aug 19th, anyway.

[21:28] <tbrowder> * if it were up to me, i would add the contents of 11 to the top of 12.

[21:30] <tbrowder> *at that time precedence seemed to be keeping the test for a detailed bug report with exact input.

[21:31] <tbrowder> anything else is backup for a similar problem

[21:31] <tbrowder> possible similar problem...

[21:39] <vrurg> tbrowder: I would appreciate it if you add it to 12. JJ request for an article puts me on very tight schedule.

[21:42] <tbrowder> will do. mind if i move the common sub into a Test::Misc module?
