[17:37] <gfldex> m: my $a = "foo" but %{ bar => 42 }; say $a.AT-POS("bar");

[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 357a7f300: OUTPUT: «This type cannot unbox to a native integer: P6opaque, Failure␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:37] <gfldex> should the P6opaque leak here?

[17:39] <MasterDuke> m: my $a = "foo" but %{ bar => 42 }; say $a.AT-KEY("bar");

[17:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 357a7f300: OUTPUT: «Type Str+{<anon|1>} does not support associative indexing.␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:40] <MasterDuke> think the first error should be more like that one?

[18:03] <nine> MasterDuke: about 30s

[18:04] <MasterDuke> nice. i get ~37s with my 3700x.  that would be a nice improvement, but i can probably wait to skip a generation

[18:04] <nine> I wonder, if faster memory would make a difference. Compilation has few tight loops and much moving stuff through memory. I only have DDR 3000

[18:06] <MasterDuke> overclockable?

[18:07] *** lucasb joined
[18:07] <MasterDuke> that's what mine is too

[18:08] <MasterDuke> oh wait, mine is 3200. i think phoronix had some compilation benchmarks that showed 3200 as a sweet spot

[18:08] <MasterDuke> which is why i didn't spring for faster

[18:41] <sena_kun> Don't forget to set a XMP profile in bios.

[19:36] <MasterDuke> time before last i flashed my bios it unset the xmp profile, but noticed and reset it last time i flashed. do have another bios update sitting around, will try to remember to do it (and check xmp profile) next time i need to restart

[20:06] <patrickb> I just changed the binary release build scripts for Linux to use CentOS 7 instead of 6 as 6 went EOL in 2020-11. As a consequence the rakudo 2020-12 binary release and later ones will not work on CentOS 6 anymore. Where should I document that?

[20:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: patrickbkr++ created pull request #4129: Move to CentOS 7 in binary release linux build
