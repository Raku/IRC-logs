[00:50] <vrurg> .ask AlexDaniel Could you, pls, add thoughtstream to Raku org and Raku team?

[00:50] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel`

[00:51] <vrurg> .ask AlexDaniel and nwc10 too, please.

[00:51] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel`

[00:52] <AlexDaniel`> vrurg: changed your role to Owner

[00:52] <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: thanks!

[00:53] <AlexDaniel`> I prefer to add people to Everyone team first, this way they only get subscribed to https://github.com/Raku/please-turn-off-the-autowatch-feature and the doc repo

[00:53] <AlexDaniel`> and later to add them to Raku

[00:54] <AlexDaniel`> this way people get sorta warned that they'll be autosubscribed to a bunch of repos

[00:54] <AlexDaniel`> but feel free to do it any way you see appropriate

[00:56] <AlexDaniel`> vrurg: I also gave you rights in perl6 and community-modules orgs

[00:56] <AlexDaniel`> so that you can add people there too

[00:57] <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: good, thanks again! 

[00:57] <AlexDaniel`> you're welcome!

[00:57] <vrurg> I was a bit late to see your note about Everyone. But this time it's a bit special case anyway.

[00:58] <AlexDaniel`> I have scripts, btw

[00:58] <AlexDaniel`> let me seeâ€¦

[01:00] <AlexDaniel`> https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/c936816bdfcf4ba89d59e8bd8777ecd8

[01:00] <AlexDaniel`> one invites all members of one org to another org

[01:00] <AlexDaniel`> another invites all members of the org to a team

[01:01] <AlexDaniel`> never really figured out where to commit these, and how to do the token thing nicely

[01:01] <AlexDaniel`> but maybe you'll have an idea

[01:03] <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: er... Will see. I wasn't prepared for all this, time will show.

[01:06] <vrurg> The bulk team addition would spare me some time today. :)

[09:22] <tyil> https://rakudo.org/star this page is giving me a 500 error, anyone else getting this too?

[09:22] <tellable6> 2020-06-22T22:39:01Z #raku <AlexDaniel`> tyil: which nickname does raku-bridge take if raku-bridge is taken?

[09:22] <tyil> hmm

[09:24] * Altai-man_ feels https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/commit/012e7e272c45c07c101e72264805bcd03d14897c

[09:25] <tyil> AlexDaniel`: I don't actually know, and I can't find the answer on the README of the source project either (https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc)

[09:32] *** patrickb joined
[09:33] <patrickb> tyil, Altai-man: I suspect that commit as well. I'll have some time in the evening to look at this.

[09:33] <patrickb> tyil: So, yet, it seems it's broken for everyone.

[09:34] <tyil> patrickb: ack

[09:34] <tyil> I can log in to the rakudo.org server, but I'm not sure where (or if) I can read the logs

[09:35] <tyil> so I can't help out much on this one

[09:38] <rba> tyil: Looking if I find a way to trouble-shoot this...

[09:51] <rba> [2020-07-15 09:42:52.93468] [4820] [error] Can't call method "ver" on an undefined value at template star.html.ep line 36.

[09:51] <rba>   36:     <span class="version"><%== latest_version('star', 'macos', 'x86_64')->ver %></span>

[10:05] <rba> patrickb: I've tried a quick fix, but I think it needs more effort. I can confirm it's the commit above. May you be able to look into this?

[10:05] <patrickb> rba: I'll look

[10:07] <rba> patrickb: Let me know when I can help.

[10:19] <Kaiepi> should fixes for non-blocking bugs wait?

[10:23] <Altai-man_> Kaiepi, probably yes.

[10:23] <Kaiepi> aight

[10:23] <Altai-man_> Kaiepi, you can always have them in PRs and then review-merge.

[10:24] <Altai-man_> This release is on the calm side, I think, and we probably want to have it this way.

[12:36] <tyil> the Windows variant displays the correct latest version, 2020.05.1, but the GNU+Linux tarball still shows 2020.01, even though there is a 2020.05 available (https://rakudo.org/downloads/star)

[12:42] <patrickb> I pushed a fix for that problem a few minutes after the first change.

[12:43] <patrickb> Is it possible the website didn't update since then?

[12:43] <patrickb> That's the change: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/commit/7cc3467dd12891a98437e7d41c32be1910e91934
