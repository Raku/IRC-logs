[15:21] <Xliff> Quite possibly, this is my mind telling me I need a break.

[15:23] <Xliff> Updated.

[15:24] <Xliff> It things work fine and the first occurance is accepted, but the next occurents thrws a TypeNotfound

[15:25] <timotimo> GZLib vs GZlib

[15:27] <Xliff> Derp! Find hilighting is case insensitive. :/

[15:28] <timotimo> find?

[15:28] <Xliff> Ctrl-F in Atom

[15:28] <timotimo> huh, strange

[15:35] <Xliff> It's not set that way by default

[15:35] <timotimo> i see

[15:44] <Xliff> Does Match contain the line in the matched string, or just the character range?

[15:44] <Xliff> Is there a way to grab the line? 

[15:48] <timotimo> you will have to count newlines in the .prematch

[15:49] <Xliff> Ouch. OK. Thanks.

[15:51] <timotimo> well, depending on how you're matching, you may already be doing line-by-line matches anyway?

[16:28] <Xliff> timotimo: sub line ($m) {  ( $m.prematch ~~ m:g[ (\n) ] // () ).elems + 1; }

[17:27] <sena_kun> I am still curious why I appear to be the only person who doesn't see spectest speedup with new hashes.

[17:36] * lizmat didn't see it either

[17:36] <lizmat> I guess we need a benchmark that is more hash intensive

[17:38] <sena_kun> Oh, so I'm not the only one. I saw people reporting like 10% or something, which sounds pretty good. But yes, whole spectest is a beast.
