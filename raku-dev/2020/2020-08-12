[17:21] <JJMerelo> And we're out of articles at the 20th anniversary calendar https://raku-advent.blog/

[17:22] <tobs> with 6 days open, or 7?

[17:22] <JJMerelo> 7

[17:22] <JJMerelo> I just uploaded the article by leont, scheduled for this AM

[17:23] <JJMerelo> So, 7 to go.

[17:23] <tobs> and you have no promises to collect?

[17:23] <tobs> as in promised articles

[17:26] <JJMerelo> Well, [Coke] did AFAIR, but that's it.

[17:27] <JJMerelo> Let me check.

[17:27] <JJMerelo> Correct, that's the one.

[17:28] <JJMerelo> So that would make it 6, I guess.

[17:28] <JJMerelo> Still, I guess I'll write something for tomorrow.

[17:29] <tobs> I'll try to write about RFC 190 then.

[17:30] <JJMerelo> tobs that would be awesome

[17:30] <tobs> I'm almost sure that it is about what I think it is :)

[17:31] <JJMerelo> tobs :-)
