[01:24] <Xliff> nine: Well, another strike out, here. I thought that file locking would block for as long as it needed, yet this comes up almost immediately -- "Could not obtain blocking, exclusive lock: Failed to lock filehandle: 9 in block <unit> at /home/cbwood/Projects/rakudo-precomp-nolock/tools/build/install-core-dist.p6 line 35"

[01:35] <Xliff> Ah! Maybe not. Now have it working through "make install"... and with the right version! This is a good sign.

[01:40] <TreyHarris> Xliff: Thinking a bit more about it, as a sysadmin originally, I think seeing Raku and NativeCall, many Perl/Python/Ruby-only coders who are intimidated by C would very well think--"gee, that looks a lot easier than C, I can handle that". So beefing up the "marshalling/unmarshalling" info (which is pretty well covered in the NativeCall tutorial, but does assume you know, e.g., the difference

[01:40] <TreyHarris> between a struct an union and how enums work)--how to get data from a Raku data structure, into a native call, and back out again--would actually probably be a very good thing for giving Raku more killer app areas

[01:43] <TreyHarris> I've wanted a Proc::ProcessTable port for awhile, maybe when my current engagement ends I should do the port babel-style as a tutorial on how to create a NativeCall interface based solely on proc(5) and procinfo(8) and header files without referring to C source.

[01:46] <TreyHarris> Dealing with jiffies and strftime might be a bit of an issue.

[01:48] <TreyHarris> Or maybe not: https://modules.raku.org/dist/Date::Calendar::Strftime:cpan:JFORGET (jforget++)

[01:58] <Xliff> TreyHarris: Actually, that sounds like fun.

[01:58] <Xliff> Pretty much 90% of p6-GtkPlus was written that way (from the .h files... no .c knowledge necessary aside from how to read the API)

[01:59] <Xliff> If you'd be interested in help, I'd be glad to pitch in.

[01:59] <TreyHarris> I did a simple p5 wrapper and that was so easy, a port seemed unnecessary. But it's simple enough (particularly if I just seed it with Linux and Darwin or something and accept PR's for any other OS's) that I think it would be a good exercise.

[02:00] <Xliff> True, enough.

[02:00] <TreyHarris> Xliff: sure, I'll loop you in when I have a skeleton. What editor do you use, out of curiosity?

[02:01] <Xliff> Atom these days, with a sprinkling of vim.

[02:04] <TreyHarris> Okay. I haven't had a look at what new LP tools are out there these days, but the last time I did around 2015, Org-mode was teh siht if you used Emacs. But I don't think it matters--I think for these sorts of things, weave/tangling isn't really necessary except once, when you're writing the English part. After that, you pull the code out and do any future coding in the native files and leave the

[02:04] <TreyHarris> literate source alone as an artifact

[02:06] <TreyHarris> I doubt I'd even publish the org or web or whatever files except rendered as html

[02:07] <Xliff> Sounds like a plan, then.

[02:07] <TreyHarris> oh, interesting. some people are using jupyter for that these days. makes sense.

[02:08] <Xliff> Hah! Sure does.

[02:09] <TreyHarris> The one thing about the p5 wrapper I did to Proc::ProcessTable is that its interface is very un-Rakuish, so if you wanted to glance at it on CPAN and give me any thought on a more Raku interface, that'd be awesome

[02:10] <Xliff> Hmmm.... OK

[02:11] <TreyHarris> It's mostly because of the lack of proper iterables or lazies in Perl, so, seems ripe for Rakuification

[02:11] <Xliff> https://metacpan.org/release/Proc-ProcessTable/source/lib/Proc/ProcessTable.pm <- This one?

[02:13] <TreyHarris> huh, I thought it was this one: https://github.com/jwbargsten/perl-proc-processtable but its VERSION is 0.02, where the one you're linking to is 0.59, so that's odd

[02:13] <Xliff> Oh. I am looking at that one, too.

[02:14] <TreyHarris> ah, looks like that's just an old snapshot... but... the version regressed? hmm

[02:15] <TreyHarris> oh, no, every .pm has its own independent VERSION and I wass looking at Proc.pm

[02:15] <TreyHarris> nm

[02:16] <Xliff> Hmm... we can replace the use of Storable with a JSON file.

[02:16] <TreyHarris> yeah, I used YAML

[02:17] <TreyHarris> JSON's smarter for anything being used for more than just me for a one-off :-)

[02:19] <Xliff> Heh.

[02:19] <Xliff> Where's your wrapper?

[02:22] <TreyHarris> On a VM on a share on a machine whose power supply I need to get around to replacing :-) It was stupid, stupid though. I think I copied the... oh, no, I just eliminated the cache_ttys option because that's not an expensive operation on Linux

[02:23] <TreyHarris> But I just cloned the source and removed the whole Storable thing

[02:23] <Xliff> HAH!

[02:26] <Xliff> I'd almost want to write this as pure raku...

[02:26] <Xliff> Burt that might be me suffering from Not Invented Here...

[02:30] <TreyHarris> Could you do pure Raku on a /proc-less OS, though?

[02:30] <Xliff> Ah. Nope.

[02:30] <Xliff> Depends on how difficult reading the process table is, though.

[02:31] <Xliff> Would need need a C-Helper lib for all the OSes that did not support /proc

[02:31] <Xliff> So we'd have to abstract the table representation.
