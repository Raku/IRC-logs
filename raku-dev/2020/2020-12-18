[17:59] <cog> Forgetting to quote an opening brace in a double quoted string has dire consequences. The error message "variable $foo is not declared" does not help and I got stuck for a while without a clue.  Syntax hilting in VScode does not help either. Where should I file a RFE ?

[18:02] <cog> Probably being out of sync compared to the user expectation can trigger other error messages.

[18:24] <sena_kun> cog, rakudo issue tracker is the place, I think, just provide a snippet for folks to reproduce.

[22:22] <cog> A followup to my previous question. Is it possible to set the default behaviour of quoted strings. When generating C code with a lot of braces, it is tiresome to write 

[22:22] <cog> say qq:!c:to<END>;

[22:23] <cog> Having to think to write :!c every single time. 

[22:28] <cog> I would not be so fussy if that was not raku.
