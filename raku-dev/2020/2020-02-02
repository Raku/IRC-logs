[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Make Str.comb(Regex) about 1.8x as fast

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: By bypassing the whole convoluted Str.match logic altogether, and

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: directly going to its underlying iterator logic.

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: This opens up the possibility of adding :ex and :ov named arguments

[09:12] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: quite easily to Str.comb, anybody interested?

[12:00] <nine> There's free pizza and generally a great vibe in the community devroom :)

[12:13] <nine> rba: somehow on docs.raku.org the requests for scripts and stylesheets fail quit often (needs a page reload or 5 to fix). Looks like the server's closing the connection without any response at all. May be due to network at FOSDEM but everything else works just fine

[12:14] <nine> rba: actually it affects even the HTML page itself, too. Reproducible with curl: curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 104

[12:16] <nine> errno 104 is connection reset by peer
