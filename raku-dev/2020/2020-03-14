[14:18] <MasterDuke> huh. 60k calls to `type_check` and 31k calls to `find_method` when building rakudo. most common method is is_generic in Parameter, most common type is Routine in Method

[14:18] *** Kaiepi joined
[14:18] <MasterDuke> but is that expected? because stuff won't have been composed until the end of the setting?

[14:25] <nine> MasterDuke: I wonder if we could compose those earlier?

[14:26] <MasterDuke> how? move them earlier in the build order?

[14:27] * lizmat has bad memories trying to move stuff around in the core setting, especially in the early parts

[14:28] <lizmat> things may break and the error messages are generally awful (or compilation just hangs)

[14:28] <lizmat> MasterDuke: but please, be my guest  :-)

[14:29] <MasterDuke> where is that list?

[14:30] <lizmat> tools/templates/6.*/core_sources

[14:30] <MasterDuke> thanks

[14:35] <lizmat> afk&

[14:39] <MasterDuke> nine: heh, moving Method before Routine caused 17 fewer 'looking for type Routine in Method'

[14:40] <MasterDuke> 6207 instead of 6224

[14:44] *** titsuki joined
[14:46] <MasterDuke> nine: but given the problem with shaped native arrays, it seems like there's a more general fix to be had

[14:47] <nine> MasterDuke: I can tell you that Int.pm6 definitely must come before Parameter.pm6

[14:51] <MasterDuke> nine: one thing i don't understand, what does it mean for there to be method calls to a non-composed class?

[14:56] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Please don't move Method before Routine. Method inherits from Routine. I'd be surprised if that didn't have very bad consequences at some point.

[14:56] <jnthn> Like any methods defined in Routine in the setting not being in the cache or some such

[14:57] <jnthn> A method call on a non-composed class just means it looks at the set of methods it knows about so far, without consulting the cache. The caches are *authoritative*, which is an important optimization (sometimes knowing a method does not exist is significant).

[14:58] <jnthn> So you can't publish those until you know the full set of methods.

[14:58] <jnthn> That said, there are protections against this to a degree (I think add_method invalidates the cache, just in case)

[14:59] <jnthn> (But that's a local invalidation, so won't impact subclasses, which is why order matters.)

[14:59] <MasterDuke> add_fallback does invalidate it

[14:59] <jnthn> Yup, makes sense, 'cus in that case the cache *can't* be authoritative, iirc

[14:59] <jnthn> Because we don't want to say "no" based on lack of cache entry when there's a fallback.

[15:00] <MasterDuke> moving things hasn't had any noticeable effect, so i'm not planning to do any more experimenting that way

[15:01] <MasterDuke> but i haven't yet been able to find a better place to (re)publish the caches

[15:02] <jnthn> Yeah, I was gonna look into that yesterday, but ended up getting distracted on another shiny thing I wanted to hack on :)

[15:04] <MasterDuke> heh. and i got distracted trying to figure out why --profile-stage silently dies/doesn't work when trying to profile the rakudo build (but does work on something smaller)

[15:08] <MasterDuke> but no success

[15:14] <MasterDuke> well, re-applying my reverted PR does also dramatically reduce the 'looking for type' logging messages i added when building rakudo. i.e., not just in that sample code with the native shaped arrays

[15:17] <MasterDuke> so it looks like a good fix will have some more general benefit as well
