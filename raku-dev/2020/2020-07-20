[01:56] <timotimo> did we already figure out the "missing or wrong version of NQPHLL"? it looks like when trying to build the core.c setting it's looking for some things in the install/ folder that wouldn't be there yet in a regular install

[01:56] <timotimo> first install/share/perl6/lib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.moarvm

[01:57] <timotimo> no, not "first"; that's the only one it does i think

[08:14] <patrickb> I'm not entirely sure this would trigger the error.

[08:15] <patrickb> When there are actually no changes to nqp, will the nqp version be actually incompatible?

[08:15] <sena_kun> Hmmmm.

[08:16] <sena_kun> Probably, you are right. Then we want such a commit closer to an actual code?

[08:16] <sena_kun> That's an easy option we should go for (if it works), as editing actual code can introduce other possible issues.

[08:19] <patrickb> I think I don't understand. To trigger the error, we would need to make some change to code in NQP that ends up in some .moarvm file  that's used by Rakudo.

[20:37] <lizmat> retwat

[20:37] <Altai-man_> The odd thing is that I could not trigger a single flapper for the whole release tests and it was feeling very weird.

[20:37] <Altai-man_> Almost as something is broken.

[20:38] <Altai-man_> And I was using more threads, not less as often suggested.

[20:38] <Altai-man_> Anyway, email is blocked by binary releases, I think.

[20:39] <Altai-man_> Also, I hope some brave hero will update the website as well.

[20:39] <Altai-man_> Comma release tomorrow. o7

[20:55] <lizmat> Altai-man_: looks like the test for Inline::Perl5 in spectest is borked again  :-(

[20:56] <Altai-man_> lizmat, as in?

[20:57] <Altai-man_> lizmat, they are not run or?

[20:57] <[Coke]> t/spectest.data is referring to RT

[20:57] <lizmat> Inline::Perl5 not installed: not running Perl 5 integration tests

[20:57] <lizmat> You can install Inline::Perl5 into the build directory with

[20:57] <lizmat> ....

[20:57] * [Coke] wonders why we moved spectest.data out of rakudo into roast.

[20:58] <Altai-man_> lizmat, when doing release tests, I saw this, it also shows the command to do that, so I *did* run Inline::Perl5 tests. But yes, the thing that it does not do it automagically is a bug.

[20:58] <[Coke]> lizmat: didn't you just rebuild and blow away your install directory?

[20:58] <Altai-man_> s/do that/properly instal the thing and then run tests fine/

[20:58] <lizmat> ok, done that command, installed Inline::Perl5 again, and now tests it

[20:58] <Altai-man_> Yes. This is a bug, but not release bug.

[20:58] <Altai-man_> Don't scare me please. :)

[20:59] <lizmat> [Coke] I did that several times last week, yes, but Inline::Perl5 *was* installed  :-)

[20:59] <[Coke]> lizmat: ok. :)

[21:12] <[Coke]> spectest.data looks like the test file names have gotten out of alpha order over the years.

[21:26] <[Coke]> had 2 spectest failures on master: https://gist.github.com/coke/92b1d5dc2038bb1554bfb6c8fba18c49

[21:30] <lizmat> cannot confirm  :-(
