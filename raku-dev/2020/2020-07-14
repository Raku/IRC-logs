[11:07] <AlexDaniel`> > I know its not their target audience but they missed a trick not targeting LLVM for raku. It would be an immensely powerful language with some compile time stuff and the AoT speed to back up the more expressive features.

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast: 

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast: Also seems to generate better code than the current compiler:

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast: 

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast: * Doesn't emit a pointless scan node inside of the capture

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast: * Will only closure-clone the inner code object once per scope entry

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast:   containing the rule (we maybe can avoid doing it at all with further

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast:   analysis). This means a bunch less work in the case of a quantified

[11:13] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo/rakuast:   captured group capturing many times.

[11:44] <timotimo> lizmat: i think it was because i made it a drop-in replacement for JSON::Tiny

[11:44] <tellable6> 2020-07-14T10:23:07Z #raku-dev <lizmat> timotimo I wonder why JSON::Fast.form-json doesn't return a .Map without containers ?

[11:44] <lizmat> ok

[11:45] <timotimo> it would be better to have containerless stuff, yeah

[11:45] <lizmat> I'm thinking of doing another round of JSON::Fast optimizations

[11:45] <timotimo> i haven't spent enough brainergy on how exactly to manage a deprecation cycle or something for such a change

[11:45] *** vrurg joined
[11:45] <lizmat> we could do it with an :api<2> ?

[11:46] <lizmat> or I could just take it to another namespace ?

[11:46] <lizmat> or with a different :auth<> ?

[11:47] <timotimo> possible, but i'd like at some point for JSON::Fast without any specifiers to give you the new behaviour

[11:49] <lizmat> well, there was only 1 test that failed when I made [ ] return an Array without containers

[11:49] <lizmat> having it return a List broke a lot  :-(

[11:50] <lizmat> but that is really because we don't have an "is-list" test in Test

[11:53] <timotimo> so we're testing with eqv or is-deeply or something?
