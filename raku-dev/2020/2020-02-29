[14:19] <tbrowder> hi, anyone else seeing moarvm compiler warnings when buiding raku master?

[14:26] <MasterDuke> tbrowder: yep, there are a couple known ones

[14:28] <tbrowder> ok, being worked on by someone i assume.

[14:42] <lizmat> eventually, probably  :-)

[15:06] <tbrowder> would it be useful to have some txt file in the moarvm repo showing the  versions of the the compilers used for each commit? i know back when i was doing a lot of c/c++ dev it seems there could be lots of differences in warnings depending on what specific compiler each user was using.

[15:07] <lizmat> tbrowder: you probably ask that on #moarvm

[15:07] <tbrowder> ok

[17:18] <patrickb> rba: I'm unable to find the discussion ugexe and I had about which build toolchain to use on Windows.

[17:18] <tellable6> hey patrickb, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/f28ee2a7f368d117ac374b25858aa622

[17:20] <rba> patrickb: ok

[17:21] <patrickb> There were a lot of fuzzy points about which libraries one could link to, compatibility with native MS libraries, ease of installation and so on.

[17:22] <patrickb> In the end the gut feeling was that msvc might provide more compatibility even though it's definitely more work to get it building.

[17:22] <patrickb> sena_kun: I'll have a look at the dyncall stuff

[17:22] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to sena_kun

[17:23] <lizmat> dogbert17: indeed, closed thanks for the nudge

[22:02] <patrickb> Anyone with some Makefile- and / or sed-foo around? I'd like to get some feedback whether the following change is sensible: https://github.com/patrickbkr/dyncall/commit/845a18b6d01b58bd76ef84cc7f38c0c4c80e193d

[22:07] <leont> So many leaning toothpicks :-p

[22:07] <leont> Pretty sure that won't work outside gmake, but I'm not sure we care about that

[22:10] <patrickb> leont: I suspect other makes might also be used. Nmake seems to have its own Makefile, but others I'm not sure.

[22:11] <leont> On unix, the main varieties are gmake and bmake.

[22:11] <leont> On linux make is the former, on bsd it's generally the later, though bsds often also have gmake because linux people ignore bsd.

[22:11] <patrickb> leont: What do you suspect is breaking when using other makes?

[22:12] <leont> THe quoting spaces bit.

[22:13] <leont> Actually, you can verify this easily: most linux distros ship bmake (I know both debian and arch do)

[22:13] <leont> Just try if it works with that

[22:13] <patrickb> So bmake might not escape spaces with \

[22:13] <patrickb> I'll give it a try

[22:15] <leont> Actually, it looks to me like it needs gmake anyway, because the bsd include syntax is «.include», not «include»

[22:21] <patrickb> Hm. According to the dyncall readme they explicitly support gnu, bsd and sun make flavors

[22:21] * patrickb can't install bmake because of a fedora bug :-(

[22:35] <Altai-man_> patrickb, o/

[22:37] <Altai-man_> patrickb, thanks for the dyncall help! About the fix: the maintainer stated it's checked against all platforms in their test suite and with musl. as for moarvm with this fix: should be tested as well.

[22:39] <Altai-man_> there is a quickly done tarball available which consists of 2020.02 and a cherry-pick of the bump, which can be tested on alpine if https://github.com/JJ/raku-alpine-test will get some travis love from JJ.

[22:40] <Altai-man_> given it builds, I can do a point tomorrow (thuogh my reluctance to do so is more with each day passed since the release)

[23:10] * lizmat wonders what the @autovivs parameter to Mu.BUILDALL does, and if it can be removed

[23:11] <lizmat> just before she goes to bed&
