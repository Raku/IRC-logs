[13:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[14:24] <MasterDuke> how do i generate the statement prefix 'try' in QAST? e.g., `try "abc".Int` as something like `QAST::Op.new( :op('call'), :name('&try'), <...>)`

[14:25] <moritz> it's not that simple, look for statement_prefix:sym<try> in src/Perl6/Actions.nqp

[14:28] <MasterDuke> hm. it's actually in Actions that I want to generate it. guess i can call that method with self and the appropriate argument to generate the QAST?

[14:57] <moritz> if you have an appropriate Match object, yes
