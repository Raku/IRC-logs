[10:39] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: btw let me know when you're ready with https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/24

[10:39] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: I also need to understand the notation, right now there are two ToDo lists with some items checked, what's the meaning of these?

[10:45] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, the first one is exact (!) output, ticked off Lumberjack is a true positive, which is already addressed, everything else are false positives. The second comment has some grouping and also my thoughts about possible common reasons.

[10:50] <Altai-man_> ugh

[10:51] <lizmat> gesundheit!

[10:51] <lizmat> I guess the dispatch test reverts still need to be merged ?

[10:51] <Altai-man_> lizmat, o7

[10:52] <Altai-man_> They are, but now I'm having another issue with them. `Test` has no idea about fudge directives I was suggested to use, so now it fails with `planned 4, run 0`.

[10:52] <Altai-man_> Can't we use -done-testing and `plan *`?

[10:52] <Altai-man_> I don't really understand how other files with rakudo todo have plan with a number.

[10:53] <AlexDaniel> right, but how are you running it?

[10:53] <AlexDaniel> make t/‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶ ?

[10:53] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, z ss? :)

[10:53] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-03-02T15:01:56Z #raku <uzl[m]> jmerelo I've checked off some of the documentable changes for https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3229

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-03-05T15:18:52Z #raku <chloekek> jmerelo: was also interested in this.

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-03-18T09:17:39Z #raku <patrickb> jmerelo Do you need help with the rakudo star docker image? jjatria is willing to help!

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-03-18T21:48:23Z #raku-dev <hankache> jmerelo hi JJ, some links on the language/community page have been changed a while back but docs.raku.org still shows the old ones. Does it need an update or is it a bug somewhere?

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-03-20T22:13:22Z #raku <uzl[m]> jmerelo: Could you take a look at this "feature" branch (https://github.com/uzluisf/Pod-To-HTML/tree/render-changes) for Pod::To::HTML? BTW, is there any reason why the `pod2html` and `node2*` subroutines are exported?

[10:55] <tellable6> 2020-04-03T09:56:25Z #raku <Kaiepi> jmerelo, can you take a look at https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3301 and https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3279 ?

[10:56] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: I've bumped your access level, but fixing the conflicts is only useful if you're about to merge something

[10:57] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: so really fixing the conflicts is not the first step in figuring out what needs to be done with these PRs

[10:57] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel that's the thing. In many cases it's more a matter of it being really necessary. 

[10:58] *** sena_kun joined
[10:58] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: what do you mean?

[10:58] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel well, it's more kind of a test to see if the OP is still invested in the PR or if there's any need for that feature any more.

[10:58] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: also, when you're bumping these PRs, please change the base from `nom` to `master` if possible

[11:03] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel I broke it, I guess...

[11:05] <jjmerelo> And we're back down to only 100 open PRs... :] 

[11:06] <timotimo> sorry about leaving my trash all over

[11:10] <jjmerelo> timotimo sorry for not checking it out earlier :-)  The thing is that I keep meeting old issues when I try and write docs, so that's why I'm kind of invested on this

[11:11] <timotimo> you did check it out last year though :P

[11:17] <jjmerelo> timotimo what about this one? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/998 

[11:18] <AlexDaniel> indeed, tellable6 did skip a message: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2020-04-20#l10

[11:19] <AlexDaniel> I wonder if it's some kind of throttling or something

[11:19] <sena_kun> lizmat, ping?

[11:19] <lizmat> pong

[11:19] <sena_kun> lizmat, I have _everything_ fresh, rakudo built and `make t/spec/S32-list/reverse.t` results in: Parse errors: Bad plan.  You planned 22 tests but ran 19..

[11:20] <sena_kun> >Type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected Any but got Mu (Mu)

[11:20] <lizmat> that would be the three tests I added ...

[11:21] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: possibly a rakudo vs roast mismatch

[11:21] <AlexDaniel> e.g. you testing an older version of rakudo with newer roast

[11:21] <sena_kun> And also `/usr/bin/perl' -I'/home/blin/R/rakudo/tools/lib' -I'/home/blin/R/rakudo/3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib' t/harness5 --moar --fudge --keep-exit-code --verbosity=1 t/spec/S06-advanced/dispatching.t` (so fudging is in!) results in `You planned 4 tests but ran 0`.

[11:22] <sena_kun> d'oh

[11:22] <lizmat> that's because roast reverts aren't merged yet ?

[11:22] <sena_kun> apparently, wrong rakudo branch, sorry

[11:22] <lizmat> *phew*

[11:22] <sena_kun> lizmat, they are (https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/a6d0f04570f33c4b6272a52e216997b91e31cbe3)

[11:23] <lizmat> I'm still seeing t/spec/S06-advanced/dispatching.t failing completely

[11:23] <lizmat> maybe that whole file should be removed from spectest.data for now ?

[11:24] <sena_kun> lizmat, so do I. I wonder why fudging suggested at https://github.com/Raku/roast/pull/638#issuecomment-622951771 doesn't work

[11:25] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I don't think it works this way with subtests

[11:26] <sena_kun> I am starting to want to simply rip and tear it off somehow. :S

[11:27] <lizmat> as the whole file is about the new dispatcher semantices, we could just remove the file from spectest.data ?

[11:27] <sena_kun> lizmat, and then bring it back simply adding a line?

[11:27] <lizmat> yup

[11:28] <lizmat> perhaps leave the line in there as a comment, and add a comment at the end so we don't forget

[11:28] * sena_kun comments it out

[11:32] <Geth> ¬¶ roast: 64dfd4d4da | Altai-man++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | spectest.data

[11:32] <Geth> ¬¶ roast: Disable testing of dispatcher

[11:32] <Geth> ¬¶ roast: 

[11:32] <Geth> ¬¶ roast: It seems fudge directives do no play well with subtests, so instead just comment the file out here until we have a new dispatcher.

[11:33] <timotimo> the fudger could emit a "skip-rest; exit 0" at the start

[11:41] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah, throw it away?

[11:42] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, lift the BLOCKER tag, you mean? Well, it is a change in behavior, but I think if one does some really wrong Unicode, hmm. I am not sure I see how is it a blocker.

[11:42] <sena_kun> So have no objections.

[11:43] <timotimo> whoa. release time.

[11:43] <sena_kun> timotimo, we need to prepare blin and this is a long process, 7-9 hours usually...

[11:44] <sena_kun> Good to have it this late evening, I'd say.

[11:44] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah, I don't see it as a big blocker

[11:44] <AlexDaniel> it's a bit unfortunate that the behavior is changing

[11:44] <AlexDaniel> but either way it's weird so yeah

[11:44] <lizmat> agree, it's not a blocker

[11:45] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, in the ecosystem there is only one module relying on the absence of exception, it's fixed now and author did not even use invalid Unicode on purpose.

[11:46] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: there's also Whateverable that had a test for this in unicodable6

[11:46] <AlexDaniel> these tests don't run when you install Whateverable, so Blin does not see that

[11:46] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, two :)

[11:47] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, but you don't rely on the absence of the exception? Because that'd be wrong.

[11:48] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: why though? `.chr.uniname` is relatively safe?

[11:48] <AlexDaniel> but I think jnthn was saying that it wraps around or something like that, and that the right output is somewhat accidental

[11:48] <AlexDaniel> sooo yeah

[15:42] <jjmerelo> I really don't understand what's happened to Rakudo PRs. Some of them seem perfectly fine, yet they were not approved or merged... This one, for instance https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1796

[15:44] <sena_kun> jjmerelo, nobody has taken a burden of responsibility of pressing the merge button.

[15:44] <jjmerelo> The problem now is that it's going to be difficult to fish them back from conflict hell

[15:44] <sena_kun> jjmerelo++ for looking at old PRs.

[15:44] <jjmerelo> Also, some authors are a bit angry, and I perfectly understand that.

[15:45] <lizmat> jjmerelo: perhaps we should focus on fixing the conflicts ourselves first

[15:45] <lizmat> before bothering the authors of these warnocked PRs

[15:45] <sena_kun> 826 out of 1446 modules processed

[15:45] <jjmerelo> Most of them are probably due to the change in the file names

[15:46] <jjmerelo> and are otherwise perfectly fine...

[15:46] <lizmat> yeah...

[15:46] <lizmat> will look at them after being away for a bicycle ride

[15:49] <jjmerelo> Will try that one.

[15:49] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1674 can be fixed, because src/core is now src/core.c...
