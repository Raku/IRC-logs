[09:18] <timotimo> we didn't bump moar and nqp yet?

[09:19] <Altai-man_> timotimo, we did.

[09:19] <timotimo> well, i assume we'll want this nqp pull request in there, as well

[09:20] <Altai-man_> I will cut release from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/85320f46639a0f2a73a17172a3e9353807035b09

[09:20] *** JJMerelo left
[09:24] <timotimo> the last change to MOAR_REVISION that i can see is 2 weeks old tho

[09:26] <Altai-man_> Oh, nqp was not bumped, apparently.

[09:26] <Altai-man_> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1b3780f72569f3a8a74ee4beb69c0a9ca2f2f333

[09:27] <timotimo> don't we call it "bump moar" when we change nqp to require a newer moar, and "bump nqp" when we change rakudo to require a newer nqp?

[09:27] <timotimo> anyway, if you're cutting from that earlier rakudo commit, the nqp::setthreadname stuff won't be used by Thread anyway

[09:28] <Altai-man_> You're right.

[09:28] <Altai-man_> Yes.

[09:28] <timotimo> so only spesh, ioloop, and debugserver threads will have "a name"

[09:32] <timotimo> (that is, if we do a moar bump as well, or cut the moar release from master rather than MOAR_REVISION)

[09:33] <lizmat> Files=1308, Tests=113043, 218 wallclock secs (29.46 usr  8.33 sys + 3042.16 cusr 289.71 csys = 3369.66 CPU)

[09:34] <Altai-man_> The release will be cut from MOAR_REVISION.

[09:35] <timotimo> we have a moar release volunteer yet?

[09:35] <Altai-man_> timotimo, I did it for last, dunno, three or something releases? :)

[09:36] <Altai-man_> Oh, I see actual bugfix in those commits. Ok, screw that.

[09:37] * Altai-man_ bumps

[09:37] <timotimo> if you mean the use-after-free, that bug was introduced just before that fix

[09:38] <Altai-man_> Sigh.

[09:38] <Altai-man_> timotimo, I still see some spesh goodies, how nice are they?

[09:39] <timotimo> slightly nice

[09:40] <timotimo> i haven't done any significant benchmarks

[09:45] <Altai-man_> S17-procasync/kill.t fails single every time for me now. :(

[09:52] <patrickb> The latest three commits (not part of the rakudo commit you intend to cut the release for) contain two fixes, one for argument handling on JVM on Linux and one for the `--profile` feature in relocatable builds.

[09:52] <patrickb> Both are not particularly important, but want to make sure this doesn't pass unnoticed.

[09:53] <patrickb> *NQP commits

[09:54] <patrickb> Altai-man_: Can you send an invite for the Raku org to supernovus? His original invite (during the Perl6 -> Raku move) expired.

[09:57] <patrickb> Thank you!

[09:58] <patrickb> Is the plan now to release from current HEAD?

[09:58] <Altai-man_> Yes.

[09:59] <timotimo> am i allowed to put the commits on nqp master and rakudo master to make thread names a thing?

[09:59] <patrickb> There is PR in Rakudo reverting / replacing a wrong commit in Rakudo: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3797

[10:00] <Altai-man_> timotimo, yes

[10:00] <timotimo> cool

[10:00] <patrickb> It's only waiting for review from vrurg as he wrote the original fix this PR replaces. Also not particularly bad to release the wrongish fix, but I dunno.

[10:01] <Altai-man_> patrickb, we will wait, the release is tomorrow, now today anyway.

[10:01] <timotimo> rakudo will want a bump for this tiny commit as well

[10:01] <Altai-man_> timotimo, will you do it or?

[10:02] <patrickb> There is a corresponding NQP PR to the one I just mentioned. That will then also want a bump.

[10:02] <timotimo> i don't have the script working that automatically generates a bump's commit message

[10:03] <Altai-man_> timotimo, ok, then let's wait for the patrickb case to be resolved.

[10:03] <timotimo> sure

[10:04] <Altai-man_> The script is https://github.com/Raku/z and it is nothing but godlike IMO.

[10:05] <timotimo> it wants full control of my clones

[10:22] *** ShimmerFairy left
[10:26] <lizmat> yeah, it didn't really match my setup either :-(

[10:28] <Altai-man_> lizmat, how so?

[10:28] <Altai-man_> Asking out of curiosity.

[10:28] <lizmat> I forgot the specifics

[10:31] <lizmat> it didn't have additional value for me at the time to change my setup

[10:31] <lizmat> Altai-man_: git pull, reconfig and again build failure for me  :-(

[10:32] <lizmat> Missing or wrong version of dependency '/Users/liz/Github/rakudo.moar/install/share/nqp/lib/MAST/Ops.nqp' (from 'gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp')

[10:32] <Altai-man_> lizmat, did it work after yesterday's cleanup or?

[10:33] <lizmat> yesterday, I nuked my install dir

[10:33] <lizmat> which means re-installing everything again  :-(

[10:34] <lizmat> realclean in nqp and rakudo did not fix this

[10:34] * lizmat nukes install again  :-(

[10:41] *** JJMerelo joined
[10:41] <timotimo> huh that's weird

[10:42] * lizmat runs a spectest after installing zef and Inline::Perl5 again

[10:45] <lizmat> timotimo: my changes to JSON::Fast made parsing my sample 5MB json sample file almost 2x as fast

[10:46] <timotimo> oh wow

[10:46] <timotimo> i was going to ask you for results :)

[10:46] <lizmat> 3.262 -> 1.864

[10:46] <lizmat> I'm not done yet

[10:47] <timotimo> ask you for your results*

[10:47] <lizmat> Altai-man_: make test and make spectest are clean for me

[10:50] <timotimo> we shouldn't forget to merge your performance changes to rakudo's internal json impl

[10:51] <lizmat> yeah, but *after* this release

[10:51] <timotimo> sure

[11:10] *** dogbert17 joined

[11:13] <lizmat> dogbert17: welcome to my world

[11:13] <dogbert17> :-)

[11:14] <dogbert17> I guess it will be fixed soonish

[11:14] *** Altai-man_ left
[11:16] <lizmat> dogbert17: afaik, nobody knows why yet

[11:16] <lizmat> I only know it started happening after patrickb's merge yesterday

[11:19] <patrickb> I have an idea what the probleme might be

[11:19] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commits/master <- Should those RakuAST commits be there on master?

[11:20] <patrickb> I did an NQP bump in yesterdays merge. Those commits were part of the bump.

[11:21] <lizmat> which ones?

[11:22] <dogbert17> 32be685690ec87b perhaps

[11:22] <linkable6> (2020-07-13) https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/32be685690 Remove reliance in a $*W object in alt NFA gen

[11:23] <dogbert17> There are three commits from jnthn there. Question is if they made it into master by mistake, i.e. git happens :)

[11:27] <timotimo> that looks harmless

[11:28] <timotimo> yeah those can go in a release no-prob

[11:28] <patrickb> Does anyone actually know what the "Missing or wrong version of dependency" error is actually about?

[11:31] <timotimo> something not being rebuilt when it should have been?

[11:32] <patrickb> So changes to the build system would be potential causes.

[11:33] <dogbert17> last working rakudo commit seems to be 85320f46639a0

[11:33] <linkable6> (2020-07-12) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/85320f4663 Revert "Add support for suggestions to X::CompUnit::UnsatisfiedDependency"

[11:33] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/cf6f4178e6ba769fdfd242c2134edfe2   # patrickb 

[11:34] <patrickb> lizmat: That's in the NQP build, not Rakudo, right?

[11:35] <lizmat> no, that's the rakudo build

[11:35] <lizmat> MoarVM and NQP were already built

[11:36] *** JJMerelo left
[11:40] *** [TuxCM] left
[11:41] <patrickb> lizmat: It breaks on nqp bumps, correct? So yesterday evening on my nqp bump and today on the one by Altai-Man?

[11:41] <lizmat> yes

[11:41] <lizmat> that would be a correct assessment, so far  :-)

[11:44] *** vrurg left
[11:49] *** vrurg joined
[11:52] *** [TuxCM] joined
[11:53] <patrickb> lizmat: Do you build MoarVM, NQP and Rakudo separately or automatically via Rakudos Configure.pl?

[11:54] *** vrurg left
[11:54] <lizmat> automatically via Configure.pl

[11:54] <lizmat> see my gist: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/cf6f4178e6ba769fdfd242c2134edfe2  :-)

[12:05] <patrickb> lizmat: You did not clear the install/ folder prior to rebuilding nqp, correct?

[12:06] <lizmat> indeed

[12:06] <lizmat> nuking that makes the problem go away

[12:08] *** wildtrees joined
[12:11] <patrickb> The install/share/nqp/lib/MAST/Ops.nqp file that is claimed to have the wrong version is actually generated and installed by MoarVM.

[12:12] <jnthn> It's compiled as part of the NQP build, however.

[12:14] <nine> You should never have to nuke an install folder. I guess we're missing a dependency in a Makefile

[12:21] <patrickb> I have to leave. Maybe I'll find some more time in the evening to have a look at this...

[12:30] *** vrurg joined
[13:12] *** Altai-man_ joined
[13:15] *** sena_kun left
[13:17] <dogbert17> I got around the above problem by checking out and building 85320f46639a0, which worked, and then switching back to master and rebuild again, which also worked !?!

[13:21] <timotimo> lizmat: i wonder if the cost of adding a tiny "nom-ws" version into parse-string (the fast-path version) to go in between cclass::word searches

[13:22] <timotimo> is much higher than the win you could get for strings that only have space-separated words in them

[13:22] <timotimo> i wonder if a split model of lexer, then parser, would be any win at all

[13:23] <timotimo> it'd even be possible to run both in parallel, but the overhead may be completely unwarranted

[13:24] <timotimo> perhaps "only if the json document is more than 32 kbyte big" or whatever

[13:24] *** [TuxCM] left
[13:25] <timotimo> i'm not very fond of just willy-nilly starting a promise in a library that's used in big as well as small programs

[13:25] <timotimo> since if you just read a config at the start, then the rest of the program is fully single-threaded / synchronous, you'll have the supervisor running and twiddling its thumbs for the entire run time -> cpu and memory usage increased

[13:37] *** [TuxCM] joined
[13:38] <timotimo> (certainly not worth it with the implementation attempt i just came up with, d'oh)

[13:54] <lizmat> timotimo: my approach atm is:

[13:54] <lizmat> 1. encountered a "

[13:54] <lizmat> 2. look for the closing unescaped "

[13:54] <lizmat> 3. convert string inbetween including the starter to Uni

[13:55] <lizmat> 4. drop the first element of Uni

[13:55] <lizmat> 5. generate the appropriate codepoints from the Uni array

[13:55] <lizmat> 6. convert to string and return

[13:56] <lizmat> this should fix all of the decorated " stuff at the start of the string

[13:56] <lizmat> without causing too much overhead

[13:56] <lizmat> ah, Uni is NFD of course

[13:58] <jnthn> Uni is unopinionated

[13:58] <timotimo> Unipinion

[15:40] <lizmat> patrickb: I guess we need another NQP bump ?

[16:00] <patrickb> lizmat: Altai-Man planned to do one prior to the release, so we can just wait for that.

[16:01] <lizmat> eh... don't we need a Blin run with it?

[16:01] <patrickb> I guess so

[16:02] <patrickb> Altai-Man: What's the plan wrt bumping nqp?

[16:02] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[16:06] <sena_kun> patrickb, was the fix of the fix you mentioned merged?

[16:07] <patrickb> sena_kun: Yes. That's the commits you see above. From my side everything is ready for a bump.

[16:07] <sena_kun> If so, I'll make a bump and it goes without saying run blin...

[16:08] <patrickb> vrurg: Can you have a look at https://gist.github.com/lizmat/cf6f4178e6ba769fdfd242c2134edfe2 I'd value your opinion.

[19:59] <lizmat> after this bump, rakudo does not build for me anymore again

[19:59] <lizmat> what is the current remedy apart from nuking install ?

[20:00] <sena_kun> Yes, I noticed that too. Something is _very_ busted.

[20:00] <sena_kun> This is probably a release blocker.

[20:00] <lizmat> yeah  :-(

[20:01] <lizmat> so there is no remedy known atm?

[20:01] <sena_kun> lizmat, can you please fill an issue? Not sure if I know more than you do, while I'm writing changelog.

[20:01] <sena_kun> Yes.

[20:02] <lizmat> will do

[20:02] <sena_kun> Thanks.

[20:06] <sena_kun> Geth just announced my bump, no?

[20:06] <lizmat> it didn't announce the ticket, just the assigning ?

[20:07] <lizmat> anyways, ticket made ^^

[20:07] <sena_kun> nice

[20:07] <lizmat> meanwhile /me nukes install again  :-(

[20:30] <vrurg> lizmat: totally weird kind of problem. I plan to work on it today.

[20:30] * vrurg doubts it's about a dependency.

[20:31] <lizmat> afaik I reverted all of my work on module loader

[20:31] <sena_kun> vrurg, good luck!

[20:31] <lizmat> vrurg: maybe you should double check my commits didn't do it

[20:36] <sena_kun> Ok, so changelog is ready...

[20:36] <vrurg> It's so nice to get a block in less than a day to the next release schedule...

[20:36] <vrurg> s/block/blocker/

[20:37] <sena_kun> I think it was introduced last night (for my timezone, hm), so it is not like we had it for weeks. And we can always push the release a bit later, it is a matter of quality at this stage anyway.

[20:37] <AlexDaniel`> at least it's not a day after the release

[20:38] <sena_kun> Yesh. So much better.

[20:38] <sena_kun> .tell patrickb hi! Can you please review the changelog at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft and maybe fix description of your recent fixes? Thanks.

[20:38] <tellable6> sena_kun, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[20:39] <AlexDaniel`> but maybe it's still an option to cut the release from before the breaking changes?

[21:00] <dogbert17> ha, the build broke again ?

[21:01] <dogbert17> fortunately the workaround I used before still seems to work

[21:02] <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: there is no certainty about what is the breaking change. :(

[21:02] * vrurg is testing jvm backend for the problem.

[21:03] <vrurg> dogbert17: nuke 'em all works like always.

[21:03] <dogbert17> I didn't have to do that fortunately

[21:04] <vrurg> dogbert17: what have you done then?

[21:05] <dogbert17> I checked out an older rakudo commit, 6e087e13ea021260, configured an built it, then I checked out master and built it again and it worked

[21:05] <dogbert17> strange I know

[21:38] <tellable6> 2020-07-17T20:38:32Z #raku-dev <sena_kun> patrickb hi! Can you please review the changelog at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft and maybe fix description of your recent fixes? Thanks.

[22:29] <patrickb> sena_kun: The changelog looks good. I'm sorry I didn't manage to do it myself in time this time.

[22:29] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to sena_kun

[22:36] <Altai-man_> patrickb, oh, that's part of my duties anyway, so don't sweat over it. What matters is to explain what was done correctly, as I recall some fixes of --profile with relocatable builds, but did not found traces of it. Or I misunderstood them.

[22:36] <tellable6> 2020-07-17T16:02:15Z #raku-dev <patrickb> Altai-Man: What's the plan wrt bumping nqp?

[22:37] <patrickb> Altai-man: There is a fix for --profile. But it's in NQP. And as far as I know the Changelog only lists Rakudo commits.

[22:38] <patrickb> I think that doesn't make much sense, but that's how it was handled in the past, right?

[22:40] <Altai-man_> patrickb, oh, I see.

[22:41] <patrickb> WRT our NQP bump problem: I think I have found the cause, but am unsure how to best proceed. I hope vrurg can weight in with his opinion.

[22:41] <patrickb> I'll have to go to bed soon. I'm unsure how much time I'll have tomorrow. :-/

[22:41] <vrurg> patrickb: anywhere to look at your findings?
