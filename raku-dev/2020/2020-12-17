[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Apparently, a bug in Rakudo::Deprecations.DEPRECATED caused these

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: methods to die, rather than just produce a deprecation warning.

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Since this has been unreported for over 3 years, it feels safe to

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Remove deprecated functionality to core epilogue

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[11:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: This allows this functionality to "normally" use the "is DEPRECATED"

[13:04] <sena_kun> lizmat, I think it is a flapper.

[13:04] <lizmat> also: Please be aware travis-ci.org will be shutting down in several weeks, with all accounts migrating to travis-ci.com. Please stay tuned here for more information.
