[13:44] <[Coke]> I have a MS account if someone wants to invite me to https://dev.azure.com/Raku

[13:57] <[Coke]> trying to track down the cro abort trap. build a debug-enabled MoarVM. if I try to attach after I fire off the cro command, I get a gdb error, type "continue", then when cro aborts, gdb shows "exited normally". if I try to run cro through perl6-gdb-m, It seems to just hang.

[13:57] <[Coke]> Any other suggestions on how to debug? (on OS X)

[14:00] <[Coke]> lizmat: are you able to use cro on OS X?

[14:00] <timotimo> on linux i'd say "run execsnoop against it to see which one is the one that borks" but that's ... linux

[14:01] <lizmat> [Coke]: yes, well, it's been a while, but a $project I worked on used Cro, and it worked fine on my MBP

[14:03] <[Coke]> can you try an updated rakudo/cro and do a 'cro stub app app' at some point? I assume it's just me, but...

[15:23] <nine> No joy trying to reproduce my BEGIN time EVAL issue in a reduced test case so far but....it's not that difficult to provoke other errors

[15:26] <nine> Ooooh....it's not even a different issue after all. The "chars requires a concrete string, but got null" just happens when trying to report the "missing static code ref for closure"

[15:30] <MasterDuke> ha

[15:30] <nine> So, it really looks like a nested compilation at BEGIN time makes us lose static code refs for closures of the outer compilation unit

[15:33] <nine> Shortest golf now: use NativeCall; sub abort() is native(Str) { !!! }; BEGIN EVAL '';

[15:33] <nine> Precompile that and: Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure 'abort' (:1)

[15:34] <[Coke]> the rebuild has no impact on my cro error.

[15:35] <[Coke]> also no impact on my zef/inline p5 issue. make spectest says it's not installed. zef says it is.

[18:36] <nine> Huh...maybe it's not so much that the outer compilation unit is losing a static code ref for a closure and more like somehow the BEGIN time EVAL is causing it to need one where it wouldn't otherwise.

[18:36] <[Coke]> nine: is that on my bug?

[18:37] <nine> Dumping the QAST in compile_in_context gives the surprising result of the BEGIN time EVAL somehow causing the complete outer unit to be called in compile_in_context

[18:37] <nine> [Coke]: no, that's an issue I've been working on for a couple of days

[20:49] <nine> I think, I'm hot on the trail...

[20:51] <nine> I managed to get a full backtrace of the superfluous call to the outer unit and it seems to originate at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L1298

[20:53] <lizmat> intrigiung

[20:53] <nine> Looks like $*UNIT is the outer unit there, not the EVAL's

[20:54] <lizmat> doesn't EVAL set its own $*UNIT ?

[20:54] <nine> It's set in the grammar in token comp_unit

[20:55] <lizmat> m: slurp "ten","twenty"

[20:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 61046d769: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 2␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:55] <lizmat> so I want to change this to make it a compile time error

[20:55] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/943e0da61d84cff6a61ab8d159729594

[20:56] <lizmat> but this causes a test failure because there is some issue with the candidates

[20:56] <lizmat> but I'm not seeing it

[20:58] <nine> Oooooh!

[20:58] <nine> Of course!

[21:00] <nine> Thing is, $*UNIT is declared in the grammar. It starts to parse. It encounters the BEGIN block. The BEGIN block does an EVAL which fires up another compiler which writes to $*UNIT, so when the outer compiler's comp_unit action gets called, there's already a value there

[21:00] <nine> But wait...the inner compiler declares its own $*UNIT, so it shouldn't touch the outer

[21:01] <lizmat> it's really a "my $*UNIT" ?

[21:01] <nine> And it's the inner compiler's comp_unit action that sees the outer's $*UNIT and calls it. Why doesn't it see its own instead?

[21:01] <nine> :my $*UNIT;

[21:01] <lizmat> caching ?

[21:02] <lizmat> or maybe :my $*UNIT is lexical in the wrong scope ?

[21:11] <nine> Even declaring it in EVAL itself doesn't make a difference. I'd guess that someone re-sets it somewhere, but I can't find anything like that.

[21:11] <nine> Anyway, I think that's very decent progress already for today. More tomorrow :)
