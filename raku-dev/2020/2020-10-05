[17:00] <timotimo> lizmat: how do you try out deparsing? do youh ave a snippet  where code goes in and code comes back out?

[17:01] <lizmat> timotimo: build an AST with the RakuAST:: classes, and "dd" the result :-)

[17:01] <timotimo> sounds like work

[17:02] <lizmat> $ ./rakudo-m -e 'dd RakuAST::StrLiteral.new("foobar")'

[17:02] <lizmat> "foobar"

[17:02] <lizmat> there's tests in t/12-rakuast  :-)

[17:03] <lizmat> like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/rakuast/t/12-rakuast/statements.t

[17:06] <timotimo> writing the asts is a bit wordy

[17:11] <[Coke]> are the tests checking the text of the deparse, or just the functionality ?

[17:12] <lizmat> [Coke]: functionality

[17:12] <lizmat> timotimo: couldn't agree with you more

[17:12] <[Coke]> ok, thanks, that what I thought I was reading.

[17:12] <lizmat> [Coke]: although the tests *do* diag the deparse for tweaking  :-)
