[14:00] <sena_kun> Sorry. Well, I think it got there because you did a `git checkout -b setops-prec-non` from some branch where this commit was present, not from master.

[14:00] <lizmat> yeah, that was exactly the problem  :-)

[14:00] <sena_kun> Squash and merge is an option if you don't want to delete those two via rebase.
