[02:28] <Xliff> Can someone tell me how perl6's version number (for moar-blead) is constructe?

[02:29] <Xliff> I know the 2020.06 part comes from the git tag, but where are the build number and git hash computed?

[02:36] <[Coke]> 'git describe' ?

[02:38] <Xliff> 2020.06-78-ga30014e1a

[02:38] <Xliff> So why is the reported version still '2020.06-30-g389f0a81'

[02:40] <Xliff> I'm on my own local branch that I'm trying to keep synce with master, so it's weird. 

[02:41] <Xliff> Hmmm.... OK, so I see it's the number of commits made since the tag. *sigh*

[02:43] <Xliff> But that syncs up with my copy.

[02:50] <[Coke]> Did you re-configure?

[02:50] <Xliff> Yep

[02:50] <[Coke]> might need that to get the change into your locally built copy

[02:50] <Xliff> Hmmm....

[02:50] <[Coke]> dumb question, you sure you're testing the right version?

[02:56] <Xliff> I'm getting this when reconfiguring: "Note: switching to '2020.06-14-g5832b2628"

[02:56] <Xliff> Which makes no sense. That puts me in detached head.

[02:56] <Xliff> This is done by Configure.pl

[03:03] <Xliff> I'm now compiling piece by piece by hand.

[03:11] <Xliff> Files in install/bin are stale.

[03:11] <Xliff> And not getting moved back when doing "make install" for some reason.

[03:12] <Xliff> ln -s bin install/bin # Fixes issue.

[03:16] <[Coke]> do you have a prefix specified in your config.status?

[03:20] <[Coke]> (wondering if you accidentally changed install dirs at some point) - anyway, glad you have something working

[03:22] <Xliff> --prefix=.

[03:22] <Xliff> I think that's a default.

[03:23] <Xliff> It's odd. Last exec files in that dir were dated just 2 days ago.

[09:33] <timotimo> i believe the default prefix is "./install"?

[09:33] <timotimo> if you're using --gen-moar, you'll be getting your versions managed for you, which is the opposite of what you want, so building the pieces sparately manually is what you want to do

[19:56] <patrickb> timotimo: Some time ago when I implemented relocatability in rakudo you advised me to use set/gethllsymbol to save the raku and nqp home directories. Now I extended this to also have these symbols available in NQP. I'm not sure if this is a good way to do it, as NQP code relies on rakudo to set that symbol. Can you have a look at my two PRs above and give an opinion whether this is OK or the wrong way to do things?

[23:12] <jnthn> Your wrists are certainly more important than my tired brain that's unable to guess stuff. :)

[23:12] <jnthn> I guess `do` is the simplest of the statement prefixes. And now it's done.

[23:13] <jnthn> I think it may produce better code in the statement case than the current compiler (it doesn't bother to thunk the statement, and it looks like we do today)
