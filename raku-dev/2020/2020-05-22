[13:43] <ShimmerFairy> You know, I'm starting to think this 2013 tutorial on how to write your own language compiler in nqp is a little out of date.

[13:44] <ShimmerFairy> From what I gather, this should work, but passing some "code" with -e falls apart: https://gist.github.com/ShimmerFairy/ffd0c5f5f42a85c02980544e552a67a5

[13:45] <ShimmerFairy> REPL works, though.

[13:45] <MasterDuke> ShimmerFairy: yeah, it at least needs to be updated to reflect that nqp now defaults to integer operations, instead of num

[13:46] <ShimmerFairy> Also, switching from *@ARGS to @ARGS like NQP and rakudo do for the moar backend just breaks it more.

[13:46] <MasterDuke> assuming you're talking about the edument one?

[13:46] <ShimmerFairy> Yeah. The rubyish example in the NQP repo itself does work exactly as you'd expect.

[13:48] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy o/   looong time no see!

[13:48] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat o/

[13:51] <ShimmerFairy> Question: if you really changed the name to Raku, how come there's no NQR ???

[13:54] <lizmat> Well.. that's been discussed

[13:54] <lizmat> but it was felt that NQP as a noun, could well continue to live

[13:55] <lizmat> and frankly, changing all of core and ecosystem fixing all of nqp:: ops into nqr:: ops

[13:55] <lizmat> felt even more daunting

[13:55] <lizmat> and NQP is still Not Quite Perl anyway  :-)

[13:55] <ShimmerFairy> That's fine, I was only joking anyway :P

[13:56] <lizmat> internally, there's still a lot of renaming to do

[13:56] <lizmat> but that's tentatively scheduled around merging time of the RakuAST work

[13:57] <ShimmerFairy> Is RakuAST "macros finally", or "QAST is now part of the standard"?

[13:57] <lizmat> hopefully both

[13:59] <jnthn> Well, not really the second, since it's an AST that models Raku language concepts, where as QAST is far more low level

[13:59] <ShimmerFairy> btw, I just copied rubyish's eval method from the Compiler class, and now -e works, so I'm very confused as to a) why NQP & rakudo need @ARGS and not *@ARGS for MoarVM, and b) why those two don't need to redefine eval()

[13:59] <jnthn> But certainly "an AST for Raku that is part of the standard"

[14:00] <ShimmerFairy> That makes sense

[14:30] <raku-bridge> <Snoofkin> Revisiting jnthn's performance update last year, specifically regarding short-lived objects, I'm wondering how much progress has been made toward eliding Hash construction in object construction

[14:45] <timotimo> that may not have progressed very much

[15:01] <timotimo> i myself haven't touched the PEA implementation at all yet

[15:02] <timotimo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/pea.c#L275 - this "try_track_allocation" will see "if this is something we can potentially avoid really allocating"

[15:03] <timotimo> it currently only has a path for P6opaque REPRs, which does not include the low-level hash kind that we'd get for slurpy named parameters
