[09:56] <tyil> :(

[09:57] <tyil> --relocatable is not in the main Makefile, but I can add it to the stage where it builds rakudo and see what happens

[09:58] <tyil> do NQP and MoarVM also support a --relocatable?

[09:58] <tyil> also, are there downsides to building rakudo with --relocatable?

[10:19] <lizmat> there shouldn't be, I'd say  :-)

[12:41] <nine> Well those could be solved by my commits from yesterday. If not then time is probably best spent improving our compilation times in general

[12:47] <nine> Considering that my example application that took almost 2 minutes to compile after a trivial change is really just 6KLOC in 140 modules, I'd not be surprised if really large production code bases with large dependency trees took forever.

[13:21] <patrickb> tyil, lizmat: --relocatable is an option that can be passed to the `Configure.pl` of rakudo, nqp and moar. It's automatically forwarded.

[13:21] <patrickb> tyil, lizmat: From all I know relocatable builds are working fine also in the latest release. The only thing that broke a while ago and only recently got fixed is unicody paths on Windows.

[13:21] <tyil> patrickb: neat

[13:21] <patrickb> tyil, lizmat: Disadvantages of using --relocatable: You have to build rakudo, nqp and moarvm in the same prefix (so no separate install directories for the three). Also it's not supported on all platforms (e.g. OpenBSD is unsupported). It's also not used much yet and thus not as widely field-proven.

[13:22] <patrickb> rba: The gcc vs msvc decision is one with many subtile consequences. It influences which libraries you are able to link to. ugexe knows a fair bit about this. I came to the conclusion that it makes more sense to go for msvc (even though installation is a real pain). That's also what I do to create the precompiled packages that are featured on

[13:22] <patrickb> rakudo.org.

[13:23] <tyil> I can at least add optional support for it in the next Rakudo Star, then

[13:32] <patrickb> tyil: One of the "do it when there are spare tuits" things is changing the Rakudo Star installer (so not the source release, but the compiled one) to be relocatable and enabling selecting the install location.

[13:33] <patrickb> tyil: If we are not confident enough with the stability of the relocatable builds we could still create non relocatable builds of star, but I'm not sure that's worth the investment tbh.

[16:40] <lizmat> nine: added some debug info around the react block

[16:40] <lizmat> for some reason, CompUnit::Repository::Staging is precompiled twice with the same id

[16:40] <lizmat> (and once as part of -Ilib I guess

[16:41] <lizmat> so why *is* CompUnit::Repository::Staging not part of the setting ?

[16:43] <lizmat> ah, looks like the last recomp is done explicitely

[16:53] <nine> lizmat: well it's not something an ordinary Raku user would need. I also used it as test case for out-of-setting repository implementations which prompted me to actually fix a couple of issues with those.

[16:54] <nine> lizmat: but it could also move into the setting or even fully into CURI

[16:54] * lizmat is testing that now  :-)

[16:55] <lizmat> I would love to save ~.5 second for each "make install"

[16:55] <lizmat> looks like it works out ok

[17:04] <nine> Still it's of no use to the majority of users

[17:10] <lizmat> true

[17:11] <lizmat> another question: why are the NativeCall submodules listed separately in the core module install script

[17:11] <lizmat> wouldn't they get automatically precomped when NativeCall is precomped ?

[17:11] <nine> No, installation needs all modules listed explicitly. Same as in a META6.json file

[17:12] <lizmat> why is that ?

[17:12] <lizmat> just curious ?

[17:13] <lizmat> because that *does* shave off about .5 of a make install for me

[17:14] <lizmat> and in my interpretation, modules being precomped because they're used in a module being precomped, shouldn't make a difference wrt findability ?

[17:15] <nine> Because having tools parse module files to find out which packages they contain, didn't work out well for Perl.

[17:16] <lizmat> but... this isn't about parsing source files?

[17:16] <lizmat> 1. NativeCall gets precompiled

[17:16] <lizmat> 2. precompilation encounters a "use NativeCall::Types"

[17:16] <nine> That's the reason why we want modules to be listed explicitly in meta data and why installation refuses to guess

[17:17] <lizmat> 3. search for precomped NativeCall::Types fails

[17:18] <lizmat> 4. start up another process to precomp NativeCall::Types

[17:18] <lizmat> 5. continue with precomping NativeCall

[17:18] <lizmat> I mean, that's how it works, no ?

[17:18] <lizmat> regardless of what is in the Distribution info

[17:19] <lizmat> or am I missing something ?

[17:20] <nine> That's how they would get precompiled, not how they would end up getting installed

[17:22] *** Ven_de_Thiel left
[17:23] <lizmat> aha... so I *was* missing something

[17:23] <lizmat> but the precomped file is created at the place it would be to be installed, right?

[17:24] <lizmat> it's just that the $*REPO wouldn't know about it, so a "use NativeCall::Types" would fail ?

[17:24] <nine> Unless....you're using the Staging repo, as then the precomp file wouldn't even be in the same place

[17:26] <nine> btw. I'd actually love to see install-core-dist.raku getting changed into a build-core-dist.raku and moved to the build stage with the actual installation happening with a simple cp

[17:28] <lizmat> you would have to elaborate on that for me, if you would like me to look into that

[17:30] <nine> Right now the script is running (and compiling) as part of the install target and installing directly into $(DESTDIR)$(RAKUDO_HOME)/core. Now the whole point of the Staging repo is to split compiling and installing, so you can compile with an unpriviledged user and need privileges only for the actual installation.

[17:30] <lizmat> nine: BTW, in the install script, it says 'core' on line 27, and 'CORE' on line 35....  is that correct ?

[17:30] <nine> Instead, we should compile into gen/ like we do for all other files and have the install target just copy those files to the final location

[17:31] <nine> lizmat: yes, 'core' is the repository's name while 'CORE' is the distribution's name

[18:42] <lizmat> and at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationRepository.pm6#L234 that's set if no set already

[18:43] <lizmat> but then at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationRepository.pm6#L237 we have a new lexical by the same name ?

[18:47] <lizmat> perhaps IO::Path could do with a "checksum" method  ?

[18:48] <lizmat> basically doing a nqp::sha1(self.slurp(:enc<iso-8859-1>))

[18:53] <moritz> sha1 is basically broken; we shouldn't encourage its use in new applications in userland

[18:56] <nine> lizmat: yeah that second variable is poorly named. Should probably be $unit-checksum or so

[19:57] <nine> lizmat: yes, it's an implementation detail of CompUnit::PrecompilationStore::File

[19:58] <nine> As such it may know how PrecompilationStore::File works

[19:59] <lizmat> ok, then I wonder why it is not just called "File" in there

[20:00] <lizmat> the name with :: sorta implies outside visibility to me

[20:28] <lizmat> nine: if you create CompUnit::PrecompilationUnit::File with dependencies => ...

[20:28] <lizmat> and then call !read-depencies

[20:29] <lizmat> those dependencies will get added...  is that intentional?

[20:29] *** [Tux] left
[20:37] *** Xliff joined
[20:38] <nine> lizmat: no

[20:38] <lizmat> ok, so read-depencies should really reset the @!dependencies

[20:39] <nine> I'd like to say that's the nice thing about this class being private: we know how the only user behaves :)

[20:39] <nine> But yes, resetting @!dependencies would be cleaner

[20:39] <lizmat> well, it isn't that clear from the |c in one of the clients  :-)

[20:40] <lizmat> is new-unit called a lot ?

[20:42] <nine> Just once per file we precompile

[20:42] <lizmat> and the dependencies are only direct dependencies, right ?

[20:43] <nine> no, they're the transitive dependencies

[20:44] <nine> A precomp file knows the full list of all dependencies we need to load to make it happy.

[20:44] <lizmat> aha... so that list could become... big

[20:45] *** [Tux] joined
[20:45] <nine> Potentially all the modules of your application with all their dependencies. So several hundred to several thousands for really large apps

[20:46] <lizmat> right

[20:48] <nine> I wonder if we could even record the store we expect the dependency to be in. Then we wouldn't have to look up anything but open exactly the files we need.

[20:50] *** [Tux] left
[20:53] <nine> lizmat: I just realized: we call !read-dependencies on all dependencies of the precomp file we're after to get the dependency's checksum. We don't actually use the dependency's @!dependencies though (we do however need to advance the file's read position to the start of the bytecode)

[20:54] <lizmat> so what use is @!dependencies then ?

[20:55] <lizmat> if it is just about moving the pointer, then we could do that faster  :-)

[20:55] <lizmat> like setting the line seperator to "\n\n" and then doing a single .get ?

[20:56] <lizmat> ah, no, because we need the checksum

[20:57] <lizmat> hmmm... there *is* a dependencies method

[20:57] *** [Tux] joined
[20:58] *** [Tux] left
[21:00] <nine> It's necessary for the top level dependency. The one that's requested by the source file we're compiling

[21:00] <nine> We've got to get that list of transitive dependencies somewhere :)

[21:01] *** [Tux] joined
[21:01] <nine> Xliff: just curious. Do you see any change in compile times with this week's rakudo commits?

[21:02] <lizmat> nine: I think the next patch will make a difference

[21:11] <Xliff> nine: Your latest changes have blown up rakudo-precomp-nolock. I haven't had a chance to fix them.

[21:12] <Xliff> Every time I try and merge my changes into a new rakudo, it hangs on the final phase of "make install"

[21:12] <Xliff> Plus... $dayJob interference. :(

[21:53] <jnthn> I have no idea...are you looking at --target=ast when you meant to look at --target=optimize, and the optimizer has turned it into something else?

[21:54] <MasterDuke> heh, i'm in the optimizer

[21:54] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MasterDuke17/rakudo/commit/5343ac1579bc8e8ebcf7f6a731518141a9918dbb

[21:54] <jnthn> I suspect what you're looking at is not what is being run.

[21:56] <MasterDuke> this is the --target=optimize output https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/28c81a1371032f50acd9e42f4c985293

[22:00] <jnthn> Hm, what are you meant to return in a QAST::ParamTypeCheck?

[22:01] <jnthn> I thought it was an integer 1 or 0, but it looks like you're returning the parameter

[22:01] <MasterDuke> hm, i can change that

[22:01] <jnthn> (Actually a Bool is also fine)

[22:01] <jnthn> And you'll want to make sure the final non-matching one is falsey also

[22:02] <MasterDuke> but that error is occurring in that code, if i call `a(1)` it runs just fine

[22:02] <jnthn> yeah, that'll be why

[22:03] <MasterDuke> ?

[22:03] <jnthn> Because it can unbox 1 to use as the "is this passing the type check"

[22:04] <jnthn> Pass a(0)

[22:04] <jnthn> And I bet even if 0 is in the Junction it will fail anyway

[22:04] *** |Tux| left
[22:04] <MasterDuke> with 0 i get the normal `Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$a'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Int (0)`

[22:05] <jnthn> Yes, but did you put 0 into the junction?

[22:05] <MasterDuke> ooo, but yeah, if i put a 0 in the junction i get `Internal error: inconsistent bind result`
