[10:46] <nine> Finally another step forward on in-process precompilation: just don't steal a .WHO if we're precompiling - unless it's from the same serialization context. We will deduplicate aka merge_globals anyway on loading the compilation result.

[13:50] <lizmat> I mean, it would be a coercion to the ^refinee, and than an istype of the result ?

[13:52] <lizmat> and that recursively, I presume ?

[17:39] <patrickb> What use is / was the --nqp-lib rakudo command line parameter? It exists, but has no functionality anymore. Should it do something? Can it be removed (after a deprecation period)?

[17:45] <moritz> removing it sounds good to me (if it really doesn't do anything anymore)

[17:47] <patrickb> A grep in rakudo, nqp and MoarVM sources show no place where the parameter is actually accessed.

[18:35] <moritz> src/rakudo-debug.nqp and several Makfile templates use it

[18:37] <patrickb> moritz: The makefiles *set* the option. rakudo-debug.nqp defines the option. But there is logic in rakudo to act upon that option. It's effectless.

[18:43] <patrickb> *there is no

[18:51] <moritz> then we should start by removing the usages

[18:53] <patrickb> agreed
