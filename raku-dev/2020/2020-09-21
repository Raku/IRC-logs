[11:38] <ugexe> Xliff: zef has no insight into what rakudo is doing while it spawns processes to precompile, so I’m not sure how you think zef is going to give you any sort of hook. I’ve explained this to you in the past.

[11:39] <Xliff> ugexe: So can zef pass control to something that does? What would need to happen to do that?

[11:39] <ugexe> It all happens inside of rakudo 

[11:40] <Xliff> And how does zef invoke rakudo?

[11:40] <ugexe> It’s running. Rakudo 

[11:40] <ugexe> CURI.install($dist)

[11:41] <Xliff> So since no hook exists in zef, then it is Rakudo that needs to chage.

[11:41] <Xliff> s/chage/change.

[11:41] <Xliff> Sounds like CURI::Instal is the place to do it.

[11:43] <Xliff> ugexe: I'll have to look into CURI::Install when I have a minute.

[11:43] <Xliff> Thanks for the pointer.]

[12:40] <notable6> lizmat, 3 notes: https://gist.github.com/3c641f065bbcf5e7ed4d5fd3b513ba10

[12:43] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: not sure if you have seen this: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2020-09-21#l7

[12:45] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: basically, [Coke] can publish the results except that some people voted but [Coke] cannot find their commit bits

[12:46] <lizmat> looking at the users in https://gist.github.com/coke/07f167179135f6a868b6a0d526d5437e  I think sadly none of them can be accepted

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: well, I argued that alabamenhu and camstuart have enough contributions (and in one case even access to a community module) so they should've been invited

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: are you referring to all of the people mentioned or just the ones in “Please investigate” ?

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> fwiw if you say all of them can't technically vote I won't object :)

[12:48] <lizmat> well, actually https://github.com/alabamenhu joined Raku org yesterday, so one could argue they had a commit bit in time

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> well, yes, but it was my doing

[12:49] <lizmat> however, https://github.com/camstuart only joined today, so after the deadline, so I'd say their vote could not be accepted

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2020-09-20#l359

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> also, “(discounting their ballots didn't change the top 7, but it did change the order slightly)”, so not really a big deal

[13:12] <AlexDaniel> yeah that code is just wrong

[13:13] <AlexDaniel> just remove the `self == 0` condition and see what happens?

[13:13] <AlexDaniel> it will end up calling False.floor which gives the right result

[13:23] <MasterDuke> moritz: remember the reason for the == 0 check?

[13:24] <MasterDuke> removing it passes `m-test m-spectest`

[13:24] <moritz> no, I don't remember :-)

[13:24] <moritz> maybe it was to avoid a (potentially costly) method call
