[13:49] <bartolin> for the record: I've seen a couple of new spectest failures on the JVM backend (NullPointerExceptions in sub onlywrap when running S02-names/is_cached.t, S06-advanced/disaptching.t, S06-advanced/wrap.t). If I'm not mistaken the relevant code was added/modified with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3500. I hope I'll find the time to isolate the failing code and to open a proper issue.

[13:51] <bartolin> vrurg: a small question (from looking at the changed code): it looks like wrp-do https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/e111420845/src/core.c/Routine.pm6#L120 isn't used anywhere. Was that an oversight?

[19:10] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: The Cool class also has a contains method which implicitly converts the

[19:10] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Cool to a Str and calls Str.contains on it. But the new candidates were

[19:10] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: not mirrored in Cool, so the OO loop wasn't as convenient. This commit

[20:03] <vrurg> But luckily, they're clones of the existing ones.

[20:04] <bartolin> vrurg: I see. Not sure if I'd have been able to help with that. All the better if you figured it out :)

[20:04] *** lizmat_ left
[20:04] <vrurg> BTW, wrp-do is not used. More than that, thanks for spotting it: I noticed that cloning of user wrapper isn't actually needed.

[20:07] <bartolin> cool. I'll try to figure out what goes wrong on the JVM backend. I suspect it's a different piece of code. Maybe I'll have to ask for help later ...

[20:10] <vrurg> bartolin: NullPointer is an old problem. I think it's in Dispatcher.nqp in lines like `if $!next_dispatcher` because $!next_dispatcher could be VMNull.

[20:11] <vrurg> I work on this code right now, will try remembering about switching to something like `nqp::isconcrete`
