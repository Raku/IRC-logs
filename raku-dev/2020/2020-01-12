[10:47] <lizmat> yes

[10:48] <Altai-man_> I am now looking at the broken modules. I remember removing of THROW sub, was it internal?

[10:48] <lizmat> I don't think it's documented

[10:49] <lizmat> sure, will do

[10:49] <Altai-man_> I suspect DrForr is cool enough to do things with undocumented subs... OTOH such things can break.

[13:07] <jnthn> lizmat: `dd (1,2,3).map: { $^a, $^b }` should indeed die on an odd number of arguments; `-> { "foo" }` passed to map is also non-sensical.

[13:07] <lizmat> ok, will fix the tests then

[13:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar ff7e17f1e: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 0 arguments but got 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:08] <lizmat> one could argue that could be a compilation error, right?

[13:08] <jnthn> Don't think we can really catch the .map case at compile time since method dispatch is late-bound, but we might catch this related thinko.

[13:08] <jnthn> On the `for` loop

[19:15] <nine> This is worrying: at work we have trouble with compilation errors. Ye good olde "Missing or wrong version of dependency". I tracked it down to dependencies simply not listed in the precomp files.

[19:16] <nine> The dependencies are clearely written to STDOUT by the precomp process, but the parent process doesn't receive them all. The last 1 or 2 lines are missing in some cases.
