[19:15] <hankache> hello *

[19:18] <hankache> A question for CI gurus: The raku.guide sources are on the master branch and the published version is on gh-pages. I am currently manually updating each time a PR is merged. What are my option for automation?

[19:21] <moritz> hankache: like, make gh-pages the default branch?

[19:21] *** sena_kun left
[19:22] <hankache> hi moritz. not really. More like whenever a PR is merged etc. run my custom build script to generate the HTML pages and push to gh-pages

[19:23] <hankache> source is on master, HTML on gh-pages
