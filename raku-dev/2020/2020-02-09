[14:39] <lizmat> also: personally, weekends don't work too well for me

[14:40] <lizmat> well, haven't in the past months

[14:40] <lizmat> and maybe we should expand it to a whole week, at a lower level

[14:40] <lizmat> to give more people a chance to work on it

[14:41] <lizmat> emphasising the "marathon" part rather than the "squash" part

[14:43] <MasterDuke> a while ago i suggested slowing down to something like quarterly. two months break, 3 weeks of advertisement/prep, 1 weekend (or maybe the whole week) of activity

[14:44] <MasterDuke> i had a segfault a day or two ago when building nqp. tried running the step that failed in a loop for a while with spectests going on in the background, but couldn't repro
