[08:20] <JJMerelo> Did you know how fundamental is brace-matching in regexes, and where it was introduced? Clickbaiting tobs' RFC145 https://raku-advent.blog/2020/08/06/rfc-145-by-eric-j-roode-brace-matching-for-perl-regular-expressions/

[08:20] <tellable6> 2020-08-06T01:18:07Z #raku <guifa2> jmerelo I have the Superposition article posted.  Scheduled it for the 8th, but feel free to change it to someone else, didn't see if anyone else was scheduled

[08:20] <JJMerelo> .tell guifa2 OK, great, thanks. That date is probably OK, I'll check.

[08:20] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to guifa

[08:35] <JJMerelo> .tell p6steve tell me if you want to post it yourself at the blog or you want me to do it for you; at any case I would need to send you an invitation so that I can assign authorship. Please send me an email address you use in Wordpress via Telegram, GMail or here. I'm JJMerelo in every place.

[08:35] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to p6steve

[09:57] <tbrowder> .ask rba ref camelia and security and installing modules on demand, could it be done more securely server side by a cron job instead of relying on pushes from a bot?
