[02:13] <timotimo> so, rust has crates, ruby has gems, python has eggs and wheels, should we base the names of raku modules on the rakoon allegory? like, call them dumpsters, or trashcans, dustbins, something like that?

[05:36] <moritz> shells?

[05:36] <moritz> trashcans sounds so negative, dumpster is a brand name iirc

[05:37] <moritz> (shells isnot really a racoon metapher though)

[05:38] <moritz> burrows?

[08:26] <gfldex> What I acutally want is to define my own quote construct.

[08:28] *** MasterDuke joined
[08:28] <lizmat> I'm afraid that ¬´ ¬ª appears to be a grammar construct, rather than an actual postcircumfix op

[08:29] <gfldex> raku: sub prefix:<pre>(List:D \l) { say ‚Äöpre‚Äò, l }; pre<a b c>;

[08:29] <evalable6> gfldex, rakudo-moar 3843a1e89: OUTPUT: ¬´pre(a b c)‚ê§¬ª

[08:30] <gfldex> i can cheat with a prefix for < > but not for ¬´ ¬ª

[08:30] <gfldex> So it could be precedence.

[17:25] <nine> It's like a car manufacturer deciding to call tires "feathers" and you getting a "check feathers" message on your dashboard

[21:29] <patrickb> Where in NQP would I put a function that needs to be accessible from both nqp and rakudo code?

[21:32] <patrickb> Namely the `nqp-home()` method currently part of HLL::Compiler. That's a bad place, because depending on whether we run rakudo or nqp the compiler object is either called 'nqp' or 'Raku'. So it can't be acessed on NQP code uniformly. :-(

[21:42] <AlexDaniel`> ugexe: I'm a bit late to the party, but bisectable gave a different commit

[21:42] <AlexDaniel`> interesting

[21:43] <AlexDaniel`> sena_kun: anyway, it's just that there happened to be no test for it, I don't see a way for a release manager to notice this kind of breakage :(

[21:44] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, yeah, I assume we have no such things for debug server as well (though it has tests as there are ecosystem modules used as clients).

[21:44] <sena_kun> No hardship or guilt trains here, it's weekend, I'll do a point.

[21:45] <sena_kun> s/quilt/guilt/

[21:45] <AlexDaniel`> I'm not sure about the debug server

[21:45] <AlexDaniel`> for example, MoarVM::Remote is skipped by Blin

[21:46] <AlexDaniel`> don't know about App::MoarVM::Debug

[21:46] <sena_kun> One more reason to check, I guess.

[21:46] <sena_kun> Anyway, have to go afk. o/

[21:59] <AlexDaniel`> nine: it's a common theme, everything needs a ‚Äúcute‚Äù name for some reason.
