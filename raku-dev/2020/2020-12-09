[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: This should make no change if an Iterator:

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - already has a sink-all method

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:

[21:06] <MasterDuke> too bad

[21:06] <nwc10> technically actually seems to be "hold" but no idea if it restarts or scrubs properly

[21:07] <MasterDuke> it's kind of amusing just how unimpressive it looks. my uncle's tiny farm has grain silos that look more futuristic

[21:16] <nine> scrub again? :(

[21:17] <nwc10> no, not yet. Reminds me of the joke

[21:17] <nwc10> "how do you keep an idiot in suspense?"

[21:17] <nwc10> "I'll tell you tomorrow"

[21:18] <nwc10> in that, the on screen caption says "T-02:06 CLOCK APUSED. STANDING BY FOR NEW T-0."

[21:18] <nwc10> and nothing changes

[21:18] <nwc10> (although the tide in my beer glass slowly goes out)

[21:20] <nine> Well to the experienced Boca Chica tank watcher, this is all par for the course ;)

[21:21] <nwc10> yes.

[21:21] <nwc10> the crane, it's been stuck there on the road now for 45 minutes. Is it ever going to move again...

[21:22] <nwc10> oh, it's now ETA well past my bedtime

[21:22] <nwc10> but they have some overly fancy transitions on their graphics

[22:22] *** sena_kun left
[22:47] *** MasterDuke left
[22:54] <[Coke]> WOW

[22:54] <[Coke]> ... well, it's never going to move again. :)

[23:22] <lizmat> but it did do the belly flop and it did hit the mark.  With just a little excess velocity, possibly because the raptors didn't fire up fast / well enough ?
