[11:27] <tbrowder> hi, was there any consenus on adding a $*UNICODE or similar to give unicode version being used?

[12:26] <[Coke]> tbrowder: probably worth creating a problem-solving ticket. (which I thought I had done years ago, but cannot find one.

[12:27] <tbrowder> ok

[12:40] <lizmat> since I don't think we can actually switch Unicode versions during execution, that should probably be a $?UNICODE variable

[12:41] <timotimo> not during execution, but you could feasibly switch moarvm versions without it forcing a rebuild of the precompiled data

[12:42] <[Coke]> I imagine that's a feature people would want, but I don't think any of our uni infrastructure would support that.

[12:42] <timotimo> or do we have something that does that?

[12:42] *** pamplemousse joined
[12:43] <[Coke]> timotimo: but the rakudo unicode version would still be 'constant' over a runtime of raku

[12:43] <lizmat> timotimo: afaik, precomps are tied to the version of the backen

[12:43] <lizmat> d

[12:43] <lizmat> so I don't think you could share precomps between different MoarVM versions ?

[12:43] <jdv79> would there be a var for every dep?  if its tied to moarvm isn't that a sufficient surrogate?

[12:45] <lizmat> if I'm right, I guess we should expose that value, with possble other constants, in an NQP op, and let codegen handle $?UNICODE to that nqp op

[12:45] <timotimo> we may be able to just get it as an hll sym

[12:45] <timotimo> or inside the backendconfig

[12:46] <lizmat> yup, that would work  :-)

[13:07] *** Altai-man joined
[13:10] *** sena_kun left
[13:39] *** pamplemousse left
[13:40] <timotimo> we need a place to put the unicode version, possibly in the ucd2c.pl script, because that's what we're already running when we update to a new unicode version

[13:40] <timotimo> after that, it's pretty easy to get it into the backendconfig, i think we literally just generate a header or .c file that sets up the values

[13:42] *** sena_kun joined
[13:43] *** Altai-man left
[13:52] <[Coke]> speaking of unicode, what's the current version supported by rakudo/moarvm?

[13:52] <[Coke]> 12?

[13:52] <lizmat> think so, we're lagging  :-(

[13:53] <[Coke]> 12.1, looks like

[13:53] <[Coke]> I was claiming 9 a few years ago so at least we're moving in the right direction. :)

[13:56] * [Coke] updates a few p6- labeled modules.

[13:57] <[Coke]> found the roast test data file we used to keep back in the day when we had multiple backends.

[13:57] <[Coke]> might be nice to resurrect that for moarvm/jvm/JS backends, but we don't have any other non rakudo backends to test at this point.

[23:36] <ugexe> [Coke]: if you are testing your library by passing -I. or -Ilib, then it should be getting chosen over installed versions since those repos (the default repos) come after the additional repo (-I.)
