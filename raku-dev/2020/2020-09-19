[08:06] <lizmat> t/spec/S07-hyperrace/basics.t has hung on test #7 for me last night

[08:19] <lizmat> bisectable6: my Num  $target = 9

[08:19] <bisectable6> lizmat, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[08:19] <bisectable6> lizmat, Nothing to bisect!

[08:19] <bisectable6> lizmat, Output on all releases: https://gist.github.com/44bc00bf14074b76258329f35d643ba2

[08:20] <MasterDuke> a spectest just completed fine for me

[08:20] <lizmat> yeah, it did for me just now as well

[08:21] <releasable6> sena_kun, Next release in â‰ˆ10 hours. 3 blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[08:22] <sena_kun> No in time release this time, I'm afraid.

[08:36] <MasterDuke> hm. did just get t/spec/S07-hyperrace/basics.t to die at 80 (it's been running in a loop with a spectest running in another tab)

[09:03] <MasterDuke> valgrind got me this https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/c2ad2d47535733ceeac39a06f26106c9

[09:05] <MasterDuke> ah, and now a hang

[09:14] <MasterDuke> gist updated with backtrace at the hang

[09:15] <MasterDuke> anything else of interest while i'm in gdb?

[09:18] <MasterDuke> added output of MVM_dump_bytecode

[09:52] <lizmat> I wonder if that could be related to the new hash implementation

[09:53] <lizmat> I haven't seen this hang / fail in a *looong* time

[10:23] <MasterDuke> dunno. doesn't look like hash-related stuff in the backtraces though

[10:58] <MasterDuke> haven't gotten it to hand/die yet with spesh disabled

[15:11] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: in the install dir. The `--rakudo-home` Configure parameter doesn't exist

[15:11] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: (any more?). Replace it with a perl one-liner that sets the Rakudo home via

[15:11] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: an environment variable.

[15:11] <sena_kun> patrickb, also, about testing: I think El_Che had issues with relocatable builds last release and it means 1)our azure tests somewhere somehow differ from how is it built there. If possible, it will be great to investigate this case as well.

[15:20] <linkable6> RAKUDO#3913 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3913 [BLOCKER] Fix `--rakudo-home` Configure.pl parameter

[15:25] <patrickb> sena_kun: The failures El_Che observed were the same ones I already had the PR created for. My takeaway from that incident is: If you fix something and don't intend to merge the fix right away, do create an issue as well. Then people will know that the error is known and a PR ready.

[15:27] <patrickb> sena_kun: The difference in CI and build pipeline were also already accounted for in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f2bf446cf67d190dfd6609f7865ccbae1531db96

[15:27] <sena_kun> Oh, silly me! You noted that and I forgot, sorry to double-ask.

[15:31] <sena_kun> Well, given core devs can confirm their re-building works after update, debian ticket resolved plus profile ticket resolved and then it stays calm for a week, I'd say it's safe enuogh.

[16:58] * lizmat confirms it builds cleanly on MacOS Mojave and also tests clean
