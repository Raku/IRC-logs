[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3861

[10:55] <nine> Too bad I didn't quite make it. Got two hangs in the spectest. Probably it's not a good idea after all to store only one $!lock in PrecompilationStore::File. I guess we're gonna have to make a tiny change to the API (an argument for $store.unlock which you would pass the thing you got from $store.destination)

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: Fix sorting of NaN

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: 

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: This mimics the behaviour of the official Num cmp Num wrt NaN.  However,

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: one could consider that incorrect, as the nqp::cmp_n op considers **any**

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: comparison with NaN as an equal value, instead of assuming that a NaN

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: is larger than any other Num value, including Inf.  So either cmp gets

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: it wrong, or nqp::cmp_n gets it wrong.

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: 

[12:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/sorting-with-junctions: In any case, this makes sorting with NaN values tests pass.
