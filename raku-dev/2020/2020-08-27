[08:34] <Xliff> Why the revert in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d95651f7ae778a0d4bfa2fc0d7d5721f9fdbf1b8

[08:36] <Xliff> Nevermind, I see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ee6388277f0badc797632d713356e9717250a3b3

[08:39] <Xliff> r#3875

[08:39] <linkable6> R#3875 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3875 [BLOCKER] Alpine build "raku -V" says "No exception handler located for catch"

[08:40] <Xliff> r#3785

[08:40] <linkable6> R#3785 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3785 [WIP] Revised version of the Precomp Store with file, rather than directory locking

[08:41] <Xliff> Is it possible to reopen #3785, or do I need to resubmit?

[08:49] <sena_kun> Xliff, wait a bit...

[08:49] <tellable6> 2020-08-26T11:56:11Z #raku-dev <patrickb> sena-kun: I'll do the tests, I promise.

[08:49] <tellable6> hey sena_kun, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/2341a357b0a2d79b3e29ed43baffa791

[08:49] <sena_kun> Xliff, see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3861

[08:50] <sena_kun> So nine did reverts to avoid API change in this PR and given it was release, I reverted those commits. Once the work is fine and nine is back from vacation and is great with how it looks, we can merge this PR.

[08:53] <Xliff> sena_kun++: Thanks!

[08:53] <Xliff> Worked hard on that, though! LOL

[08:53] <Xliff> nines changes are smooth though.,

[08:54] <sena_kun> Yes. I think the PR nine prepared should be 1)rebased to remove revert commits; 2)rebased on master, and then can be continued from there.

[09:07] <Xliff> OK. Unfortunately he won't be back until September

[09:07] <Xliff> Thanks, sena-kun

[09:14] <sena_kun> Well, September is not so super far away, I think. :)

[09:14] <sena_kun> Xliff, you are welcome, thanks for working on this!
