[11:19] <lizmat> .tell sena_kun updated the ChangeLog Draft with the commits that I had knowledge about 

[11:19] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to sena_kun

[11:38] <lizmat> In case people wondered why there are so few test-t results posted: [Tux] works for a company that provides IT support to 20% of the municipalities in the NL, which are very busy adapting to the IT requirements that the handling of the corona virus crisis is requiring

[11:38] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure [Tux] has other things on their mind

[11:49] <[Tux]> Rakudo version 2020.02.1-245-g0f97a7f5f - MoarVM version 2020.02.1-48-gf2a52cf5d

[11:49] <[Tux]> csv-test-xs-20      0.382 -  0.391

[11:49] <[Tux]> csv-ip5xs           0.712 -  0.727

[11:49] <[Tux]> test-t --race       0.927 -  0.942

[11:49] <[Tux]> test-t              1.990 -  2.031

[11:49] <[Tux]> csv-ip5xs-20        6.043 -  6.250

[11:49] <[Tux]> test                7.603 -  7.690

[11:49] <[Tux]> test-t-20 --race    9.844 -  9.909

[11:49] <[Tux]> csv-parser         25.413 - 25.432

[11:49] <[Tux]> test-t-20          31.527 - 32.267

[11:50] <[Tux]> as extra info, one of the things I am currently working on is to see if I can migrate from Oracle to EnterpriseDB

[11:50] <[Tux]> it is one huge interesting puzzle

[11:51] <moritz> hadn't heard of enterprisedb. Something based on postgres, it seems

[11:51] <[Tux]> and this project has gained priority because of corona: (local) government are increasingly interested in moving off-site

[11:52] <nine> EnterpriseDB is basically PostgreSQL with extensions to make migrating from Oracle easier

[11:52] <[Tux]> EnterpriseDB is PostgreSQL, but extended, so that Oracle HLI and C-programgs can be buit to work with PostgreSQL without altering the code

[11:53] <[Tux]> that is of course theoretically. In practice â€¦

[11:53] <[Tux]> well, it keeps me off the streets

[12:16] <moritz> sounds interesting
