[02:08] <[Coke]> ugexe++ # danke

[02:09] <[Coke]> zoffixznet++ indeed

[02:12] <[Coke]> ugexe: in this case, someone installed a version, refactored a class so it was in a new spot, but missed one of the references. So I think it would still have got the installed version at the old name. best approach is probably what he ended up doing, uninstalled old version entirely before testing.

[13:17] <ugexe> [Coke]: you shouldn't get the installed version though, because it comes from a later repo if you are also doing -I $path

[13:19] <ugexe> if you mean the installed version had a name that was no longer in the uninstalled version (but still referenced in the uninstalled version) then I would expect uninstalling that module to cause the uninstalled version to fail at compile time (because it cant find that name at all)
