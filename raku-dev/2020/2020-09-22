[06:34] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/667

[06:34] <patrickb> nine: Can you have another look at https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/667 ? I'd like to get this out soon-ish, so it gets some time in public before the upcoming release.

[06:46] <nine> Build systems for self hosting compilers are hard...

[06:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp: The nqp-config.nqp file contains a checksum of all the source code. That

[06:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp: checksum needs to be up-to-date for a logic in Rakudo that forces a rebuild

[07:24] <MasterDuke> timotimo: same

[07:32] <timotimo> MasterDuke: i wonder if there's some way your download gave you the earlier version or something?

[07:33] <MasterDuke> dunno. just deleted it and downloaded again, same thing

[07:34] <MasterDuke> have a hash to compare?

[07:34] <MasterDuke> i have 56ca2578f53ab3edf23adc45e0e1a955

[07:35] <timotimo> what kind of hash is that?

[07:35] <MasterDuke> md5

[07:35] <timotimo> i don't have that one

[07:35] <timotimo> hold on

[07:36] <timotimo> but that's ... got old stuff in it?!?

[07:37] <MasterDuke> ?

[07:39] <timotimo> github and travis are making me lose my mind

[07:44] <timotimo> will have a new release up soon

[07:45] <timotimo> i think i should, for sanity, put a sha1sum in my build script so i can compare what travis built with what landed on github

[07:57] <timotimo> MasterDuke: okay, b8e113854f7110cb0fdc1c824c9da1bc should be what you download from the release now

[07:58] <timotimo> and that will actually have the rakudo-appimage-launcher properly configured to run

[08:02] <MasterDuke> same link?

[08:03] <MasterDuke> woohoo, success!

[08:03] <timotimo> should be

[08:03] <timotimo> omg finally

[08:11] <timotimo> MasterDuke: but the moarperf appimage worked?
