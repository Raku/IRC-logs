[08:52] <AlexDaniel`> ah crap, just a few days short of 2021

[08:53] <AlexDaniel`> so, I've seen in some science-denying circles that when people are told the numbers about total covid cases they don't believe them because, well, they don't have anybody close to them who actually had it

[08:53] <AlexDaniel`> so, yeah, got a positive result today :S AMA

[08:54] <AlexDaniel`> goddamn 2020

[08:57] <nine> AlexDaniel`: oh, sorry to hear that :(

[09:00] <AlexDaniel`> I'm feeling OK-ish today, no cough at all for now

[09:05] <AlexDaniel`> btw not suggesting that anyone is denying anything here. Just in case.

[10:40] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel`: get well soon

[10:41] <dogbert17> nine: do you have an early review of your new system? Good, bad, noisy ...

[10:45] <nine> Cut down stage parse from ~52s to 30s. Spec test is done in just 77s. Even feels a bit snappier in general desktop use. So far system is running flawlessly. Still have to adjust the fan curves a bit, so they stay silent for short term load. When idle it's already totally quiet

[10:47] <sena_kun> nine, what's the cooling, I assume NH-D15?

[10:48] <nine> correct

[10:49] <sena_kun> nine, yay, this one is just awesome. Glad for you, have fun. :)

[10:49] <dogbert17> what have you set TEST_JOBS to, 40?

[10:50] <nine> 35 seems to be the sweet spot according to my first test runs

[10:51] <sena_kun> Isn't it good to just set number of threads available, i.e. 32 or 24?

[10:51] <sena_kun> I am running with 24, should I try higher someday?

[10:51] <nine> In general that's a good starting point, yes. Using a little more than that can still help because some threads may be blocked on IO

[10:52] <sena_kun> Interesting point, thank you.

[10:53] <nine> But then, it always is subject to experimentation. The above advice comes from a time when that meant that you'd run make -j3 and IO was done on spinning disks

[10:54] <dogbert17> I guess we can assume you're using NVME-drives now :-)

[10:55] <nine> Then ther's other factors as well. Building MoarVM is faster with make -j90 because of the (comparitively) very long time files like interp.c take. So you benefit from starting them as soon as possible.

[17:07] <Xliff> lizmat++

[17:08] <Xliff> Is there a way I can force hyper to use all cores?

[17:08] <Xliff> I;ve been attempting to write code all weekend that uses a heavy computation and rakudo only uses at most, 2-3 cores. I have 20.

[17:08] <lizmat> degree => cores

[17:08] <Xliff> Yep. That's what I suspect.

[17:09] <lizmat> .hyper(degree => 20).

[17:09] <Xliff> However even when degree is used, it still uses only 2 cores.

[17:09] <Xliff> Doesn't hyper default to $*KERNEL.cpu-cores, anyway?

[17:09] *** sena_kun joined
[17:09] <lizmat> then maybe your batch size needs to be adapted: if the batch size (default 64) is too small, there will never be a reason to start up additional threads

[17:09] <lizmat> batch => 1024 maybe ?

[17:10] <Xliff> That's what I thought, too. I can bump the batch size to 256k, and there still isn't enough load to bring up more than an additional core.

[17:10] *** lucasb joined
[17:10] <Xliff> Also... memory leaks.

[17:11] <Xliff> Well...apparent ones. Which is why I don't use a higher batch.

[17:11] <lizmat> Xliff: weird

[17:11] <Xliff> Indeed.

[17:11] *** Altai-man left
[17:11] <Xliff> So I will have to run things through valgrind after work, and hope I can decipher the output to make a report.

[17:11] * lizmat is going to be afk for the rest of the day, so won't be able to help you with that immediately

[17:12] <lizmat> ++Xliff

[17:12] <Xliff> OK. Was hoping I could get a quick answer.

[17:12] <Xliff> So I guess my computation wasn't as heavy as I thought??

[17:12] <lizmat> could be?

[17:13] <Xliff> Fair enough. Thanks, lizmat!

[17:13] <AlexDaniel`> yeah, I've been taking vitamin D regularly for a long time

[17:15] <AlexDaniel`> still no cough at all, I probably have the mildest symptoms of the 3 people in our “circle” or whatever you call that

[17:18] <AlexDaniel`> I think I feel more of an immune response than anything caused by the virus. Joint pain is pretty annoying, but, if I'm understanding correctly, that's not caused by the virus but by the immune system itself.

[17:18] <AlexDaniel`> I'm not a doctor so don't quote me on that though :)

[17:21] <AlexDaniel`> I guess I'm more sad than sick, was hoping to get at least through 2020 without getting it

[17:21] <AlexDaniel`> Thank you for your kind words, everyone!
