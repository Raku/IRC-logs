[20:29] <timotimo> hmmm

[20:29] <timotimo> imagine an "is file-contents" on an argument for MAIN

[20:30] <timotimo> it would give you the contents of the file pointed at by the argument on the commandline, slurped

[20:30] <timotimo> and when you change the variable it spurts it back into the file

[20:30] <timotimo> perhaps optionally with a backup file, too

[20:35] <lizmat> timotimo: that'd be tricky, because Parameters don't know to which signature they belong, so the trait could not check whether the parameter is part of a MAIN signature

[20:35] <lizmat> unless we build some DYNVAR magic into all of this...

[20:35] <lizmat> meh

[20:37] <timotimo> i mean, don't we already introspect the signature from outside anyway?

[20:37] <timotimo> if not, then maybe forget about that idea
