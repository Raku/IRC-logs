[00:59] <guifa2> I'm going to guess the answer is "not without slanging" but ... is there anyway to call a block such that it runs inline as if it had the same lexical scope?

[04:07] <pamplemousse> .tell patrickb Assuming my code still works with all the changes that have been made to the codebase since I last touched it, which is definitely an assumption, it lets you precompile a user program that either uses no modules, or only uses one module that only contains a single file.

[11:57] <pmurias> lizmat: why do we want an explicit 'use precompilation' to precompile scripts?

[11:58] <lizmat> because running a script somewhere until now, did not mean you would need write to disk rights before

[11:58] <lizmat> so making it automatic, could break existing installations ?

[11:59] <nine> Precompilation should handle missing write rights gracefully anyway

[11:59] <lizmat> there's that as well...

[11:59] <lizmat> it just felt quite a significant change to just throw in

[12:02] <jnthn> Depends if it can create any new problems really. I mean, ideally precomp is transparent, but we've plenty of expereince with how difficult that can be. 

[12:03] <jnthn> Perhaps could start out just doing it for scripts installed into a CURI

[12:08] <MasterDuke> `use experimental :script-precompilation`?

[12:08] <MasterDuke> so it's opt-in for a while

[12:14] <nine> First we need to make it work for the general case anyway...

[13:30] <jnthn> pmurias: This doesn't surprise me, alas.

[13:32] <pmurias> I haven't touched anything raku related in a while, but that was the case when running tests on rakudo.js (which run them always in precompiled mode)

[13:37] <MasterDuke> pmurias: how's the new job treating you? persuaded them they need raku on the truffle backend in production asap?
