[10:43] <sena_kun> Wow.

[10:44] <sena_kun> That's an unexpected (by me) speedup.

[14:07] <jdv79> 1.88 is a speedup?  iirc ~1.8 used to be normal - ?maybe a year ago?

[14:08] <Altai-man> Hm, I usually saw 1.9+ as normal for a long time.

[14:10] <Altai-man> Hmm.

[14:10] <jdv79> i guess it depends on how long you've been looking at it;)

[14:11] <Altai-man> https://colabti.org/irclogger//irclogger_log_search/raku-dev?search=test-t&action=search&timespan=&text=checked has 1.9+ 26 times and 1.8+ 32 times. But this is minimal.

[14:11] <timotimo> huh. how do i navigate to a site's <link rel="next" .../> ?

[14:11] <MasterDuke> lowest ever was 1.6 i believe

[14:11] <Altai-man> So I just had some bias, that's why the "speedup" was unexpected...

[14:12] <timotimo> ooh i can also click the title of the slide to advance

[14:13] <jdv79> https://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/images/test-t-4.png

[14:14] <jdv79> anyway; yay its going down again!

[14:19] <jdv79> interesting how in chrome that image is useless yet in ff it has text

[14:36] <timotimo> something about transparency?

[14:52] <[TuxCM]> Top 5 in speed:

[22:12] <gfldex> I'm playing with github releases. It needs only 6 steps to create a release but there is a slight problem at the end. The URL github provides is actually a HTTP redirect and zef does not follow those.

[22:13] <gfldex> I have to correct myself, sometimes it works.
