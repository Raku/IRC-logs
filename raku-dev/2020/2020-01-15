[20:10] <AlexDaniel> see, that commit is also problematic somehow

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: ↑ somehow this recent commit affects ADT module (2020-01-14) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e76f8e4d3ea62359eff129e28e82d67da154d255

[20:12] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: but the breakage of ADT predates that, no ?

[20:12] <lizmat> I mean, that one was from yesterday

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yes, and then it breaks a bit more :)

[20:13] <lizmat> wow

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> “# You failed 3 tests of 7” vs “# You planned 7 tests, but ran 6 # You failed 5 tests of 6”

[20:14] <lizmat> I see... the first test used to return some bogus structure, it now returns Nil

[20:14] <lizmat> hmmm

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: the .raku part breaks because it does `add_method` for “perl” and “gist”

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure how that can be fixed on our side…

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> like, the module strongly assumes that the method name is .perl

[20:16] <lizmat> addiing a "raku" to that list, does *not* fix the problem

[20:16] <lizmat> as long as the module inherits from Mu, Mu::raku will call module.perl when needed

[20:17] <lizmat> m: class A { method perl() { say "perl" } }; A.raku

[20:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0f0947bb1: ( no output )

[20:17] <lizmat> hmmm.. apparently not ?

[20:44] <lizmat> it is a fix for overload::constant

[20:45] <sena_kun> that's already great. :]

[20:45] <lizmat> now reverting the earlier reverts to see if overload::constant is still fixed

[20:46] <lizmat> nope, still needs the THROW revert

[20:52] <sena_kun> lizmat: which ones should I cherry-pick?

[20:52] <sena_kun> or, hmm, Blin can't run branches. :S

[20:52] <sena_kun> so cherry-picking won't really help for another round of blin...

[21:10] <lizmat> aaaaahhh... it looks like "when" codegens as a succeed

[21:30] <sena_kun> lizmat: does it mean you can write a fix?

[21:30] <lizmat> sena_kun: the fix is in the two commits I reverted

[21:31] <lizmat> I don't understand *why* that fixes it

[21:31] <lizmat> but overload::constant uses "when" inside the slang

[21:31] <lizmat> and "when" codegens to throw a succeeds

[21:32] <lizmat> so that at least is a bit of a smoking gun, but still not sure who supplied the bullet or who pulled the trigger

[21:32] <lizmat> so HEAD is now clean on overload::constant

[21:33] <sena_kun> roger that

[21:34] <sena_kun> as for cherry-picking: the problem is that the fix includes parts from `is_built` commits and I, apparently, can't smoothly pick it.

[21:34] <sena_kun> at this level I wonder if we should just move the release commit to HEAD again, that'd add some pain in writing changelog, but still

[21:34] <lizmat> before we do that, let me look some more at ADT

[21:34] <sena_kun> ok, I'll write a bit with running Blin on master

[21:35] <sena_kun> that'd be super great to address ADT today to get Blin results tomorrow's morning.
