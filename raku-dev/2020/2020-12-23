[20:30] <sena_kun> rba, ping?

[20:31] <rba> Pong

[20:32] <sena_kun> rba, hi. There are news about Alex no longer hosting whateverable bots since 27th (iirc) and I was thinking about migration. The blin server looks just nice enough with plenty of cores and memory. What do you think, is it available?

[20:39] <rba> sena_kun: if we managed to let it run within a docker container, maybe. 

[20:46] <sena_kun> rba, I think this is doable, just needs some tinkering.

[20:47] <rba> sena_kun: sounds more like a project, than a task...

[20:50] <sena_kun> rba, docker-izing was started by JJ already, just need to ensure it works fine enough locally and maybe patch up a bit. Will the repo with a ready Dockerfile be nice enough?

[20:52] <rba> sena_kun: sure :-). I will take what is around. 

[20:54] <sena_kun> rba, thanks! Can you PM me your email or something so that I could notify you when it's ready to play?

[20:56] <AlexDaniel`> you need docker-compose as well to start each bot separately

[20:57] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, so a file per bot plus another one for mothership?

[20:57] <AlexDaniel`> no, one dockerfile and one docker-compose to start all of the bots

[20:59] <AlexDaniel`> each container in dockrecompose will differ in `command:` obviously so that it starts a different bot

[21:00] <AlexDaniel`> and also possibly in mounted volumes, because most bots only need read access to data/

[21:01] <AlexDaniel`> “mothership” is basically what shareable6 is, it just shares publicly whatever it has in data

[21:03] * sena_kun is likely the last person who is able to migrate and maintain that now

[21:07] <AlexDaniel`> the proposed dockerfile needs a quality of life tweak too, first copy the META6.json file and run zef install --deps-only, only then copy the rest of the sources. Otherwise the cache will be no good and you'd have to wait a lot any time you tweak the sources
