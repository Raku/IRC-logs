[18:31] <Altai-man_> Just checking water for now. Let's imagine I want to re-make our old websites design (currently used on docs website and examples website, maybe others I'm not aware of) into something which should be better. Who with I have to discuss/greenlight it before starting to hire UI folks and do other preparations?

[18:34] <lizmat> Altai-man_: that is a good question

[18:35] <lizmat> could you hold on to that thought for a little while ?

[18:36] <Altai-man_> lizmat, sure, no hurry. Is there any particular reasons?

[18:36] <Altai-man_> s/Is/Are/

[18:38] <MasterDuke> hadn't someone done a proof-of-concept static redesign recently>

[18:38] <MasterDuke> ?

[18:38] <Altai-man_> MasterDuke, I think it was related to rakudo website?

[18:39] <Altai-man_> And merged. If not, I'm not aware of it.

[18:39] <MasterDuke> could be, i don't remember the specifics

[18:40] <lizmat> Altai-man_: working on another problem solving issue  :-)

[18:41] <Altai-man_> lizmat, I am sure my question is not really a problem-solving repo thing.

[18:41] <lizmat> no, but who should answer that question, is  :-)

[18:46] <Altai-man_> Ah. Agreed. The thing I'm worried about is that UI is very arbitrary thing. There is no particular "problem" I am having with it, just found it not very eye-candy and sure we can do a lot better than round corner footers and this shade of green, to be put bluntly (and I'm sorry for being blunt). But as I'm not a designer, most likely I will delegate it to someone who can do a great job for a buck, and don't want to end up with "The old design is 

[18:46] <Altai-man_> super best, never change that". Of course, I expect lots of iterations with getting feedback from people, not just pushing my thing, but still want to know what people think about this idea.

[18:52] <[Coke]> I think the biggest issue is making sure it's easy to update the tooling to match a new style.

[18:53] <[Coke]> I personally have no issue with an updated L&F. I'd ping JJ to make sure he's on board.

[18:53] <Altai-man_> Sorry, L&F?

[18:53] <Altai-man_> Ah, look and feel.

[19:07] <[Coke]> right
