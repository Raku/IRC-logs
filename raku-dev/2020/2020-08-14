[07:04] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: Otherwise we'd need an additional null check for the JVM backend,

[13:09] <samcv> Huh. I found a super weird bug. If you have a /share folder, running "make" will fail. it will find the system's /share/perl6/lib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.moarvm even though my prefix was somewhere else

[13:09] <samcv> I have /share linked to /usr/share
