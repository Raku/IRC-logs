[08:16] <JJMerelo> Hey

[08:16] <tellable6> 2020-08-03T17:39:53Z #raku <vrurg> JJMerelo I scheduled for today as there seemed nothing scheduled yet. Tell me please if the plan is different.

[08:17] <JJMerelo> .tell guifa can you upload your artlcle to the WP site as a draft? Let me schedule it when it's more convenient.

[08:17] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to guifa2

[08:18] <JJMerelo> .tell taboege can you please upload the article as a draft to the site? We'll schedule it when it's best 

[08:18] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I haven't seen taboege around, did you mean jdoege?

[08:18] <tobs> JJMerelo: that's me :)

[08:18] <JJMerelo> hey, tobs

[08:19] <JJMerelo> Not good at remembering context-specific nicks :-)

[08:19] <tobs> I'll try it right now.

[08:19] <JJMerelo> Great, thanks. I'll be around if you need help :-)

[08:20] <JJMerelo> .tell ab5tract how's your article for the 20th anniversary going? 

[08:20] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to ab5tract

[08:22] *** lichtkind left
[08:36] <tobs> JJMerelo: schedule for tomorrow, at which time?

[08:37] <tobs> somehow wp every page load takes 2 minutes here...

[08:53] *** JJMerelo left
[08:55] <moritz> tobs: for 00:01 UTC

[09:20] <moritz> can't see your post, I'm lacking the super editor/admin privs

[09:20] *** raku-bridge1 left
[09:21] <moritz> ah no, it seems I can see that on a different page than I was looking

[09:22] <moritz> I see two posts scheduled for the 5th

[09:28] <tobs> In the Everyone tab, I see the number "3" for scheduled posts but the listing only shows mine.

[09:31] <moritz> https://i.imgur.com/zjI9JsE.png

[09:31] <moritz> this is under https://rakuadventcalendar.wordpress.com/wp-admin/edit.php

[09:31] <moritz> (might depends on your permissions though)

[09:39] <tobs> huh, that I see. I've been looking at another interface.

[09:40] <moritz> wordpress seems to have two generations of admin interface, and the new one sucks

[09:40] <tobs> I see you're editing my post. Feel free to push it wherever it fits (if that is what you're doing).

[09:41] <moritz> tobs: no, I just tweaked the categories

[09:42] <moritz> .tell jjmerelo we seem to have two posts scheduled for tomorrow. Please decide and move one around :-)

[09:42] <tellable6> moritz, I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[09:53] <lizmat> .tell jjmerelo fixed the scheduling

[09:53] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[23:30] <tellable6> patrickz, I'll pass your message to timotimo
