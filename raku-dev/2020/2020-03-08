[10:56] <rba> patrickb: For the provided rakudo-moar-2020.02.1 binary builds is the gpg signature missing.

[10:56] <tellable6> rba, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[12:17] <bartolin> hi #raku-dev. it looks like the jvm backend doesn't build anymore. this usage of nqp::null: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4e64c5946b#diff-deae5f68054ef8116f04d6cb78bc4395R4657 seems to cause in NullPointerException

[19:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Fix JVM build

[19:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[19:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Don't use `nqp::null()` as a default for a symbol installed with

[19:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: `$*W.install_lexical_symbol()`.

[19:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/40d41a3004

[19:36] * lizmat is surprised to see 10 calls to World.find_symbol_in_setting *every* time rakudo is started

[19:36] <lizmat> one would think that after compiling the setting, these lookups would not be needed anymore ?

[19:39] <vrurg> lizmat: I think it is mostly from locations where we must ensure that the symbol we get is really from the setting and is not overriden in user space.

[19:40] <lizmat> but, if it is from the setting, we could look up the symbol at the end of setting compilation and Wval it ?

[19:40] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/652ce95e720673f4182b5e21da974c20   # the symbols being looked up

[19:42] <vrurg> First of all, I'm mistaken. find_symbol_in_setting is used when unit is not ready yet â€“ and we can't just lookup lexicals. Second case is when symbol name is CORE::Something.

[19:47] * bartolin is taking another attempt at providing a VMNull for the JVM backend

[19:47] <vrurg> bartolin: though I should warn that JVM tests never pass on my macbook. If there're any other related problems I'm not even able to check them.

[19:48] <lizmat> vrurg: but, when rakudo is started with raku -e ''  , is the unit not already ready then ?

[19:48] *** cognominal joined
[19:49] <vrurg> lizmat: '' is a compunit on it's own. One way or another, Grammar is parsing it.

[19:50] <lizmat> ok, I get that...  but the settings have already been loaded then... so we should know what "Mu" is then, no ?

[19:51] <vrurg> lizmat: token comp_unit calls compunit_stage0/compunit_stage1 from World where it connects the setting and does a lot of other work.

[19:51] <vrurg> lizmat: No, look at the end of comp_unit_stage1.

[19:51] *** cognomin_ left
[19:53] <vrurg> lizmat: Most correct would be to say that at the point Mu is requested cores are being connected already but the unit itself is still not ready.

[19:56] <vrurg> lizmat: Don't have time to test it now, but looking into stage0/stage1, it looks like find_symbol can check not for $!unit_ready but for $!in_unit_parse. That's when settings should be fully available.

[20:00] * lizmat has to be afk for a few hours, will attempt to grok when I'm back

[20:00] <vrurg> Ah, never mind. Setting is getting connected by lang-version token. So, $!in_unit_parse is too early.

[20:05] <vrurg> lizmat: I have to leave for a couple of hours too. If you willing to test the difference, then you can try adding $!have_setting on World. Set it to 1 in comp_unit_stage1 after the `$/.unistart()` call. And check for $!have_setting in find_symbol. 

[20:05] <vrurg> lizmat: It did pass compilation for me. No time for more tests, unfortunately.

[20:05] * vrurg is afk too
