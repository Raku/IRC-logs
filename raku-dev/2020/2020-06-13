[07:10] <nine> timotimo: variable declarations after code are now longer an issue :)

[07:24] <ShimmerFairy> nine: docs/contributing.org under MoarVM still claims MoarVM is living in the stone age, is that no longer true then?

[09:01] <ShimmerFairy> I can't seem to figure out a universal name of getting the name of a type in NQP (trying to write a quick little dumper). The consternation seems to be with the BOOT types, but simple examples work fine.

[09:02] <ShimmerFairy> nqp: say(nqp::istype(nqp::bootint(), nqp::bootint()))

[09:02] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[09:02] <ShimmerFairy> I can't even hardcode support for their typenames, so far.

[09:24] <MasterDuke> patrickb: any idea why e.g., https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1312 has its top three azure jobs failing? seems like those particular ones are failing across a bunch of different commits/prs

[09:25] <patrickb> MasterDuke: I have no idea, but they look like legitimate failues on first sight.

[09:29] <MasterDuke> hm, fails in repl.t in windows. i don't have any way of seeing/testing. but they're not caused by that specific pr at least

[09:34] <MasterDuke> nqp: say(nqp::bootint().HOW.name(nqp::bootint()))

[09:34] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «BOOTInt␤»

[09:34] <MasterDuke> ShimmerFairy: does ^^^ help?

[09:35] <ShimmerFairy> That's one of those simple examples that works, but $obj.HOW.name($obj) in practice falls apart (this is dealing with the output from instrumented profiling, btw).

[09:36] <ShimmerFairy> I wish I could generate a minimal (non)working example, but it's kinda hard to know what about the object makes it fall apart when all you can know about it is its REPR.

[09:37] <ShimmerFairy> For the record, it's some kind of VMArray that's breaking things.

[09:39] <MasterDuke> hm, then i'd suggest pinging timotimo

[09:44] <ShimmerFairy> here's the script, btw, with a workaround for the bad type: https://gist.github.com/ShimmerFairy/9d7545f956fc40cc4e33cd0b89b7d797

[14:21] <lizmat> they *are* pretty smart  :-)

[14:22] <MasterDuke> i suspect this is one of those cases where in all likelihood it'd be fine in practice, but in theory there's a chance for error

[15:08] <timotimo> ShimmerFairy:at the moment profile data from threads that have been removed again (which i assume threadjoin will do) will be discarded in the instrumented profiler

[15:08] <timotimo> ShimmerFairy: have you tried the debugname ops? nqp::getdebugname perhaps

[15:10] <ShimmerFairy> Haven't heard of the debugname ops, would probably help. (And btw, using threads even with threadjoin did seem to keep data, it's how I found out how multiple threads' hashes are put in the return of mvmendprofile)

[15:11] <timotimo> good to know, i thought i'd for sure have to put something in there to hold on to thread's data after they die

[15:11] <timotimo> nqp: say(nqp::debugname(nqp::bootint))

[15:11] <timotimo> hum?

[15:12] <ShimmerFairy> they don't exist, turns out

[15:13] <timotimo> aha

[15:13] <timotimo> there is only setdebugtypename in moar's interpreter

[15:14] <timotimo> i suppose it really is only for giving a c string name to moarvm's internals for easier / cheaper debug outputting in error messages and such?

[15:15] <timotimo> they are probably set everywhere we're also setting a name in the metaobject though?

[15:16] <ShimmerFairy> The one time I managed to create an error message giving some kind of name was from an error generated in MoarVM that directly looks into the STable.

[15:18] <timotimo> debugtypenames are also used in the spesh log for example

[15:18] <ShimmerFairy> nqp-m: say(nqp::bootint().new)  # one such MVM-based error, as an example

[15:18] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «Cannot find method 'new' on 'BOOTInt': no method cache and no .^find_method␤   at <tmp>:1  (<ephemeral file>:<mainline>)␤ from gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1947  (/home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/nqp/lib/NQPHLL.moarvm:eval)␤ from gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nq…»

[15:18] <timotimo> 691:#define IS_CONCRETE(o)   (!(((MVMObject *)o)->header.flags & MVM_CF_TYPE_OBJECT))

[15:19] <timotimo> looks like we do want a null check in front of IS_CONCRETE if something can be null

[15:21] <ShimmerFairy> AFAIK nqp::isconcrete() (at least currently) is meant to be just "is it NOT a type object?", which a null counts as not being.

[15:21] <ShimmerFairy> I don't know if that macro maps directly to the opcode, though.

[15:23] <timotimo> i think we mostly use isconcrete when we want to access something's attributes and such, which we can't do for type objects and can't do for null, so that's my intuition

[15:23] <timotimo> indeed, the isconcrete opcode is implemented as a null check + IS_CONCRETE

[15:24] <ShimmerFairy> I guess "is a null a type object" is a question that borders on the philosophical, could go either way :P

[15:26] <ShimmerFairy> btw, I was surprised to find that nqp::isnull_s($x) stringifies its argument. Not necessarily wrong, just didn't expect it.

[15:27] <timotimo> we did put in a type explicitly to mimic a null but not a null pointer

[15:29] <timotimo> ah, yes, that really is slightly odd; i guess you're expected to only use it on str registers in the first place? i.e. after a decont_s or some such?

[15:30] <timotimo> and if the register you're using it on is num, int, or obj, the qast compiler will helpfully place a coercion for you

[15:31] <ShimmerFairy> In the script I posted, I tried a nqp::isnull_s check right after the isnull check to print a special "null string" thing. I could've easily put a nqp::isstr($obj) in front to avoid the coercion issue, but it wasn't that important.

[15:35] <timotimo> did you steal anything from the built-in profiler dumper?

[15:39] <ShimmerFairy> there's a built-in profiler dumper?

[15:43] <timotimo> it dumps to html / json / sql

[15:43] <timotimo> so maybe "dumper" isn't the right word for it?

[15:44] <ShimmerFairy> tbf my little script is probably more of a pretty printer (or, a Raku dumper I guess)

[15:45] <timotimo> there ought to be a way to get the default dumper from regular user code

[15:45] <timotimo> Telemetry, which comes with rakudo, already offers a heap snapshot function

[15:45] <timotimo> but that's easier since moarvm does all the file output parts there
