[09:21] <Kaiepi> it's correct for this to throw, but what's with Mu:D:U in the output?

[09:26] <Kaiepi> ah, looks like it's nothing serious, just an error with how X::Multi::NoMatch generates the message

[09:29] <lizmat> feels to me that should just return True

[09:31] <sena_kun> yes

[09:32] <sena_kun> and isn't smartmatching policy is "never die"?

[09:32] <sena_kun> e.g. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1594

[09:36] <Kaiepi> yeah, it'd be nice for that to return true

[09:37] <Kaiepi> would something like `multi method ACCEPTS(Mu:U: Mu:D --> True)` and `multi method ACCEPTS(Any:U: Mu:D --> False)` work?

[09:39] <Kaiepi> hm, that's not quite right i don't think

[09:40] <Kaiepi> maybe the `:(Mu:U: Mu:U)` candidate could accept Mu:_ values instead?

[09:42] <Kaiepi> if it works, that would allow the :(Mu:U: Any) candidate to be removed, which might speed up smartmatching a little

[09:47] <tyil> hmm, 2 modules for Rakudo Star still failing: https://gitlab.com/tyil/rakudo-star/-/jobs/506277387 (OpenSSL and DBIish)

[09:47] <lizmat> hmmm.. that's not very useful

[09:47] <tyil> anyone got a clue on what to fix for these?

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what were you looking for?

[09:48] <lizmat> tyil: afaik, sena_kun has been looking into the OpenSSL stuff

[09:48] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: trying to find the candidate that handles 42 ~~ Mu:D

[09:48] <tyil> alright, I'll assume that highlight of them is enough for now, I'm not in a rush :>

[09:49] <sena_kun> I was simply removing a test which relies on particular ssl implementation too much.

[09:50] <lizmat> Kaiepi: leaving that up to you to figure out  :-)

[09:50] <tyil> sena_kun: ah, I guess you have no idea on what to "fix" here either, then :(

[09:50] <AlexDaniel> sourceable6: Mu.ACCEPTS(42)

[09:50] <sourceable6> AlexDaniel, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/604085f/src/core.c/Mu.pm6#L21

[09:51] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: like this?

[09:51] <lizmat> yup

[09:52] <sena_kun> tyil, what's the ssl implementation on this machine? ` Cannot locate symbol '(null)' in native library '(null)'` is odd. Can you check what https://github.com/sergot/openssl/blob/master/lib/OpenSSL/NativeLib.pm6#L4 evaluates to on this machine?

[09:52] <AlexDaniel> I just copied the code from the link above :)

[09:52] <AlexDaniel> the answer was about right

[09:52] <tyil> sena_kun: it's an alpine docker image, which runs on a coreos host with linux 4.19

[09:53] <tyil> https://gitlab.com/tyil/rakudo-star/-/jobs/506277387#L66 this is all the information I have about this particular runner

[09:54] <sena_kun> `make openssl-dev` hmm

[09:54] <sena_kun> m: $*VM.platform-library-name('ssl'.IO).Str;

[09:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 604085fb2: ( no output )

[09:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 604085fb2: OUTPUT: «libssl.so␤»

[09:55] <sena_kun> >Connect failed with error DBIish: DBDish::mysql needs '(null)', not found

[09:55] <sena_kun> hmm, it seems something is wrong with natives detection

[09:55] <sena_kun> Can't help with this. :(

[09:55] <tyil> too bad

[09:55] <tyil> at least I know a little bit more :)

[09:55] <tyil> I'm not too concerned with a weird test environment not working completely, so long as people using it in practice don't have any problems

[09:56] <tyil> but the more things I can fix, the better

[09:56] <tyil> thanks for giving me a pointer, sena_kun 

[09:57] <sena_kun> tyil, I'd run a simple script with the line I linked to above to see if it produces some null. If yes, that's a bug, otherwise - a more complex bug which has to be golfed...

[09:58] <sena_kun> *run in the same env, of course

[09:58] <tyil> yeah, that's what I was afraid of

[09:58] <sena_kun> tyil, by the way, was it working before or is it a new thing?

[09:58] <tyil> it's a pain to run just a single line on one of these testrunners

[09:58] <tyil> sena_kun: I don't think I've tested this before

[09:59] <sena_kun> tyil, oh... might it be that e.g. `make openssl-dev` doesn't pull .so itself?

[10:00] <sena_kun> no, it seems openssl is a sub-package of openssl-dev...

[10:01] <tyil> it doesn't seem to be an Alpine specific issue, it seems to return "libssl.so" correctly on a Rakudo Star docker image using Alpine locally

[10:05] <tyil> gonna grab some breakfast, and then I'll play around some more

[10:06] <tyil> I'd like to avoid "commit a script and trigger a gitlab-ci run", since it's incredibly cumbersome to test with :p

[11:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar f70d95e29: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[11:15] <Kaiepi> fixing smartmatching of Mu:D isn't as simple as just changing Mu's ACCEPTS candidates because of junctions, but making those work again should fix this as well

[11:19] <lizmat> Kaiepi: the difference between Mu and Any is what makes junctions work

[11:19] <lizmat> so I'm not sure how that could ever work

[11:19] <Kaiepi> oh right, that should return False

[11:21] <Kaiepi> with the change to Any's ACCEPTS candidates needed to make junctions work again i'm doing atm it's possible that might return all(True,True)

[11:22] <Kaiepi> so i might need to rethink

[20:16] <nine> timotimo: I played around some more and stumbled across the URI http://localhost:20000/#/prof/home which gives me a somewhat working profiler :)

[20:23] <vrurg_> I was just passing by and saw a few words... Is timotimo trying to fix the profiler? If so then I'm excited!

[20:23] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[20:30] <nine> I just sent a pull request for fixing that redirect in the profiler

[20:34] <bisectable6> bartolin_, Using old=@ new=HEAD in an attempt to do what you mean

[20:34] <bisectable6> bartolin_, On both starting points (old=@ new=3c83ce7) the exit code is 1 and the output is identical as well

[20:34] <bisectable6> bartolin_, https://gist.github.com/3f7fe5fb741f47a967245e68545162b1

[20:35] <bartolin_> that wasn't what I wanted to know :)

[20:36] <bartolin_> bisectable6: my @res = (LABEL: while 1 { while 1 { last LABEL } }); say "alive"

[20:36] <bisectable6> bartolin_, Bisecting by output (old=2015.12 new=3c83ce7) because on both starting points the exit code is 1

[20:36] <lizmat> m: my @res = (LABEL: while 1 { while 1 { last LABEL } }); say "alive"

[20:37] <AlexDani`> hmm I wonder why it doesn't print all three

[20:38] <lizmat> m: FOO: while 1 { while 1 { last FOO } }

[20:38] <lizmat> hmmm

[20:39] <bartolin_> lizmat: just in case you didn't see my earlier note: this seems to be a variation of https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/6336

[20:40] *** sena_kun joined
[20:40] <lizmat> could you try removing the push-all method to see whether that fixes it ?

[20:42] *** Altai-man_ left
[20:42] <bartolin_> I'm too tired right now, but I'll look again tomorrow. Thanks for the idea ;)

[20:45] <bartolin_> but one last note: we have similar tests (for the closed RT issue) in S04-statements/for.t (https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/9f418777bc). The tests do pass on MoarVM.
