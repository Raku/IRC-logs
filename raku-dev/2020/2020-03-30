[04:37] <Xliff> How can I do a "git log" so that it shows the commit where each remote HEAD is located?

[06:46] <moritz> Xliff: a git log --all --anotate shows for each commit which heads reference it

[07:00] <Xliff> moritz++: Actually, I'm using "git log --decorate --oneline --color", which works just fine when I pass it through a pipe

[07:02] <moritz> oh, decorate, not annotate
