[12:30] <nine> lizmat: we know that the other process cannot be writing anymore. We don't know that it actually succeeded writing.

[12:31] <lizmat> nine: so what does the .s check then give us in security ?

[12:32] <lizmat> if we don't know if it succeeded in writing, we don't know whether it succeeded in writing all of what it needed

[12:33] <lizmat> and any case, the .s check is checking what the directory knows about the file, not necessarily up-to-date yet with the actual size of the file

[12:33] <nine> Well we know more than without it, even if it's not 100 %

[12:33] <lizmat> so, we're writing the file at its final destination?

[12:33] <lizmat> if so, maybe we should write it with a temporary file name, and then rename it in place ?

[12:33] <Kaiepi> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2478 is something i want to revise

[12:34] <Kaiepi> 3451 and 3491 are the main ones that need attention

[12:36] <nine> We already write to a temporary file (the .bc file) and rename in place

[12:37] <nine> I remember reading on lwn.net about file system issues where a system crash in the wrong moment could have led to the rename being successful but the file still lacking its contents. I guess the .s protects us against that

[12:41] <lizmat> feels to me there would be bigger problems by then ?

[12:42] <nine> Nah, it's really just you have a power outage and end up with a zero sized file or two. It's nice to not stumble over them if we can avoid it and the test is cheap.

[12:43] <nine> Mind that in the by far most common case, we will precompile at that point and compared to that the check is really just a tiny drop.

[12:44] <lizmat> true, but this is all code that will never get hot enough to be optimized, I'd say

[12:45] <lizmat> so I wanna make sure we do as little as possible to make larger projects be able to scale up faster

[12:46] <lizmat> after a source update anywhere

[12:55] <lizmat> nine: do we have tools to investigate whether precomps gained stuff that they shouldn't?

[12:57] <nine> You mean those objects that leak into precomp files that my commit messages talk about? Can't remember really good tools.

[12:57] <lizmat> :-(  ok

[12:57] <nine> Actually the heap analyzer may come in handy there, since it can tell you about references to objects.

[12:58] <lizmat> I looked at the diff with the single-process effort...  I think it's past resurrection as such

[12:58] <lizmat> but I will look at the ideas behind it

[12:59] <nine> OMG sometimes, I can be unbelievably stupid. Like now as I'm wondering why I'm already hungry when breakfast wasn't that long ago. Only that I didn't actually eat breakfast. I just prepared it and packed it for eating at the office.

[12:59] <nine> lizmat: yeah, I figured as much. Lot's of change in that code since then

[15:57] <nine> So we're wrinting a .tmp file and rename that. Which makes more sense because the precomp file is the header + the .bc file's contents

[16:08] *** ZzZombo left
[16:08] <lizmat> so the bc file is just that: the bytecode file

[16:09] <lizmat> would it make sense to try and have the system write to an open handle?  or to have the system write to an in-memory blob

[16:37] <nine> Writing to an open handle would be nicer indeed. On that note using a pipe for the dependencies instead of STDOUT would be, too. The main reason for me not doing that in the first place was that I didn't know if that would work on Windows and it was almost December 2015...

[20:40] <patrickb> rba: I just uploaded rakubrew v6 (https://patszim.volans.uberspace.de/patcloud/index.php/s/qmkreEJLQDZcjbf)

[20:40] <patrickb> rba: Also I have a new version of the rakubrew.org website. Can you bump that?

[20:41] <patrickb> rba: Thanks for your constant support with this!

[22:04] <MasterDuke> i added `note("composed " ~ $obj.HOW.name($obj));` here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Metamodel/ClassHOW.nqp#L249 as well as notes in `type_check` and `find_method`

[22:06] <MasterDuke> when i run `constant N = 10; my int @a[N]; @a[$_] = $_ for ^N; say @a[N-1]; say now - INIT now`, i see lots of `looking for type <foo> in array[int]` and `looking for method <bar> in array[int]`, but neither when building rakudo or running that example do i see `composing array[int]`

[22:06] *** Altai-man_ joined
[22:07] <MasterDuke> there's `composed array[int]+{array::shaped1intarray}` when running the example and `composed array+{array::intarray[int]}` when building rakudo
