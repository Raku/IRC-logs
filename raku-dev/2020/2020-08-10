[17:53] <[Coke]> I think doing PRs into master makes sense, but it's unfortunate that you were singled out. Sorry about that

[18:25] <Altai-man> lizmat, I think my rant on certain problem-solving issue mentions master breakages by Patick, niner, MasterDuke at the very least. I also remember Jonathan being grumpy for next-dispatcher case implemented by vrurg originally. It is kind of heartbreaking to hear the amount of rant here was too much, because I truly admire your perseverance with this, but also perseverance of the above mentioned folks who do decent deeds because their spirit is 

[18:25] <Altai-man> strong enough to do it.

[18:27] <Altai-man> IME, blaming contributors or being unthankful is next thing to telling them to go away. I still think that if development process can make delivering some quality cheaper for developers, we should go for it.

[18:27] <vrurg_> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the most disagreement was around committing directly into master and bypassing PRs with CI checks.

[18:27] <tellable6> hey vrurg_, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/b4b942639b3906ac5f6081fb18c43168

[18:32] <vrurg> lizmat: BTW, I also had a few unpleasant moments after merging my work on roles. The point is that you're one of the most committing persons around. So, your chances of breaking something are higher than anybody's else. :)

[19:38] *** lichtkind joined
[19:39] <AlexDaniel`> Generally, considering that you tend to work on optimizations and roast is not full enough to cover all of the edge cases, I can see how there can be a perception that you break things. But when I was the release manager you always responsibly worked on fixing the regressions, so I was very happy with your work

[19:39] <AlexDaniel`> but I'd still prefer a PR-based workflow for other reasons

[19:40] <AlexDaniel`> I'm right now like… 50% into refactoring the build process in whateverable… I hope… That should include the support for webhooks

[19:40] <AlexDaniel`> this way bots will be able to run stuff here on the channel without a lot of delay (just the time it takes to build rakudo)
