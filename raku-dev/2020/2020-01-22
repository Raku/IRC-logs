[07:51] <patrickb> .tell rba Thanks for taking the time! To merge that PR there is a little careful manual work involved. (Running a script to rename some files.) I can be available this evening, given we do the merge, we could/should do it together.

[07:51] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to rba

[07:54] <rba> patrickb: I'm out of a meetup tonight. Might take up to 9-10pm CET till I'm back.

[07:54] <tellable6> 2020-01-21T20:56:43Z #raku-dev <patrickb> rba If you find the time to have a look at https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/pull/32 that'd be great. I'm more and more blocked by that merge...

[07:56] <rba> patrickb: Maybe we need to work on this again. I see you have edited the apache.conf. Yet we moved to nginx a while ago...

[07:58] <rba> patrickb: Do you know if the PRs changes are corresponding the current https://stage-rakudo.rakulang.site/ ?

[08:05] <patrickb> rba: I think stage-rakudo.rakulang.site is up to date (not entirely sure though).

[08:05] <tellable6> 2020-01-21T21:21:33Z #raku-dev <rba> patrickb: will take care of your pr tomorrow. 

[08:05] <tellable6> hey patrickb, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/45a8c77a27d81001b01573db4a89937c

[08:07] <patrickb> wrt to apache.conf changes, I just adapted all files that are in the repo. I have adapted the nginx.conf file just as well.

[08:07] <patrickb> But I know little about the actual deployment, so I appreciate a second set of eyes on those files.

[08:08] <rba> patrickb: yeah, the missing nginx.conf is my mistake... 

[08:09] <rba> patrickb: last udate of your download-rework branch wasn't applied yet on the stage site. doing it now.

[08:10] <rba> patrickb: sorry for letting you wait...

[08:15] <rba> patrickb: stage updated and hypnotoad reloaded, please have a look

[08:15] *** sena_kun joined
[08:16] <rba> patrickb: here is the current nginx config file: https://gist.github.com/3f5a52f5bde947adec3199cf8ed7e932

[08:25] <patrickb> rba: Could you put the files I linked in the PR in the staging deployment?

[08:26] <patrickb> rba: I'll look at the nginx config in the evening (not at home atm).

[08:29] <rba> patrickb: you mean the 3x .tar.gz and the 3x tar.gz.asc files?

[08:34] <patrickb> Yes

[08:35] <rba> I've put them under downloads/rakudo next to the src tar.gz files.

[08:35] <patrickb> It's working! Look at the Windows/Mac/Linux tabs now!

[08:37] <rba> patrickb++

[08:37] <patrickb> The actual download is still hindered by the nginx redirect, but we already know about that.

[08:43] <rba> patrickb: Realised you files <-> downloads in routs and http redirects. May you please explain this in more detail in the evening?

[08:44] <rba> patrickb: Is it ok if you come back to you here as soon as I'm back tonight?

[08:46] <patrickb> rba: That's fine. See you then.

[19:23] <vrurg> nine: nice article, BTW.

[19:24] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: how does blin choose what modules to test?

[19:28] <sena_kun> vrurg: what do you mean?

[19:29] <sena_kun> vrurg: when run without args?

[19:29] <sena_kun> (regarding blin, I mean)

[19:30] <vrurg> sena_kun: Let's put it this way: my OO::Plugins is on CPAN and never got tested. Though it fails since somewhere between 2019.03 and 2019.07

[19:31] <vrurg> On the other hand, AttrX::Mooish is also on CPAN, but it was in a report once.

[19:31] <sena_kun> vrurg: it uses modules provided by ecosystem lists...

[19:31] <sena_kun> give me a moment...

[19:31] <sena_kun> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/commit/6f57b722c529c358dcf068cc355b386cb8462c87 <- see this

[19:32] <sena_kun> vrurg: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/master/cpan.json does contain OO::Plugin.

[19:33] <vrurg> How does it pass then... Another macos-specific regression? 

[19:35] <sena_kun> vrurg: it does not pass, at least in my latest tests. I think the problem was that it was broken _before_ 2019.11, so it fails on both points

[19:36] * [Coke] hears macos and perks up

[19:36] <vrurg> sena_kun: That was my another thought. It seems to be correct. Since that's an old breakage.

[19:36] <vrurg> [Coke]: sleep well, it's not macos-specific, linux fails too. :)

[19:37] <[Coke]> zzzz

[19:41] <vrurg> sena_kun: thanks! Because I was wondering to make sure my bisection of the problem was correct. I would probably make #3345 a blocker after 2020.01 release.

[19:45] <sena_kun> vrurg: if it was broken for a couple of releases, then yes, a blocker after 2020.01.

[19:45] <sena_kun> but not before, please. :]

[19:56] <vrurg> sena_kun: that's exactly why I wrote 'after' :)

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I think Blin doesn't see OO::Plugins

[19:59] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel: OO::Plugin is mean, no?

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> oops

[20:00] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: sorry, my mistype. I was choosing between singular and plural and neither convinced me. Messing up since then. :)

[20:54] <rba> patrickb: Are you in?

[20:54] <patrickb> Hi!

[20:54] <rba> Hi.

[20:54] <rba> Sorry beeing late.

[20:55] <patrickb> np

[20:55] <patrickb> Reasoning for the downloads <-> files swap

[20:55] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I barely remember details, but there was a bug prior to 2019.03

[20:56] <patrickb> currently the URL is called '/files/...' and I suspect it was called '/downloads/...' before that. Thus the redirect to be backwards compatible.

[20:56] <patrickb> Now people voted they like /downloads better

[20:56] <rba> patrickb: Voting accepted :-)

[20:57] <patrickb> so I changed the urls to download. As a consequence we need to reverse the redirect

[20:58] <rba> patrickb: Ok. You mentioned a renaming of files?

[20:58] <patrickb> In the ticket in my first post there is a link to a gist

[20:58] *** sena_kun joined
[20:58] <patrickb> https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/53a7494d228888d466386448d30eb16e

[20:59] <patrickb> That script renames the star files to comply to the new naming scheme

[21:00] <patrickb> I have tested it and the test looked good, but it does touch a lot of files so there is potential for lot of breakage

[21:01] <rba> patrickb: So to go live with the new rakudo.org, I need to merge the PR and run the script?

[21:01] <patrickb> correct

[21:01] <rba> patrickb: Ah, we need to ajust the nginx config too.

[21:02] <patrickb> true

[21:02] <patrickb> I'm looking at the config now.

[21:03] <rba> AlexDaniel: Is there any kind of approval needed to merge the PR https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/pull/32 ? (Sorry, dump newby question...)

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> rba: not really. You can ask jnthn to be safe

[21:04] <lizmat> m: class A { has Int $!a is built(:bind) }; dd A.new(a => "foo")   # seems like the BUILDPLAN additions bypass typechecks  :-(

[21:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar c060a1fe8: OUTPUT: «A.new(a => "foo")␤»

[21:04] <rba> AlexDaniel: I will be the one who has to revert it, if someone is unhappy or if we brake something. So I guess I can take the risk.

[21:06] <lizmat> m: 'class A { has Int $.a }; use nqp; my $a := A.new; nqp::bindattr($a,A,q/$!a/,"foo"); dd $a  # appears to be a bindattr function

[21:06] <rba> patrickb: Have you been able to check nginx config https://gist.github.com/3f5a52f5bde947adec3199cf8ed7e932 alread?

[21:07] <lizmat> bisectable6: class A { has Int $.a }; use nqp; my $a := A.new; nqp::bindattr($a,A,q/$!a/,"foo"); dd $a 

[21:07] <bisectable6> lizmat, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=c060a1f) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[21:07] <bisectable6> lizmat, Output on both points: «A.new(a => "foo")␤»

[21:08] <patrickb> rba: https://gist.github.com/rba/3f5a52f5bde947adec3199cf8ed7e932

[21:08] <patrickb> I can't really test the config, but that's my try.

[21:09] <patrickb> I basically disabled all the redirects to github and swapped 'download' and 'files'

[21:11] <rba> patrickb: I will just apply it (syntax check it before), then we test and fix it till it works.

[21:11] <patrickb> sounds like a plan

[21:12] <rba> Other topic: I have sent request for open source sponsoring last year to DigitalOcean and to AWS.

[21:12] <rba> And from DO I haven't heard something back last year.

[21:12] <rba> AWS declined the sposonring mid of December 2019.

[21:13] <rba> DO is come back and asked me in January again, and oh wonder, we got a sponsoring of $250 to use on DigitalOcean.

[21:13] <AlexDaniel> is that like monthly or?

[21:13] <AlexDaniel> :)

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> don't get me wrong 250$ is nice but it's kinda limited

[21:14] <rba> This is just $250. When it's used, it's used. The idea is per year.

[21:14] <moritz> you can get quite a lot of compute for $20/month

[21:15] <rba> And today I got to an AWS meetup. As a goodie I got $25 on AWS. And I put it directly on the AWS account I opened last year for the sponsoring application.

[21:15] <rba> And, surprise there is already $600 on the account. Nice

[21:15] <rba> !

[21:16] *** moritz left
[21:16] <AlexDaniel> nice!
