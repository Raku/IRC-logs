[00:43] <patrickb> .tell ugexe It seems as CircleCI is doing strange things with respect to credits usage for the rakudo org as well (https://circleci.com/gh/rakudo/rakudo/4183) Can you have a look at the credits page, if there is a hint to what might be wrong (https://circleci.com/gh/organizations/rakudo/settings)? I don't have permissions to see it.

[02:30] <patrickb> .tell rba I just pushed some more changes to the rakubrew.org repo. It's possible I get rakubrew to the point where I feel confident enough to invite others to test tomorrow.

[02:31] <vrurg> Normally they're ran in parallel and that's what might cause the problem.

[02:31] *** patrickb left
[02:31] <Xliff> That might be what it is.

[02:32] <Xliff> Another thing is I am not seeing the "Multiple exceptions were thrown by LEAVE/POST phasers" in mine.

[02:32] <Xliff> Hmm.... that gives me some idea of where it might be.

[02:32] <vrurg> o/ :)

[02:32] <vrurg> rather \o/ :D

[02:40] <Xliff> vrurg: Any reason why I see better error messafes in AppVeyor than I do in my own build tree?

[02:40] <vrurg> Xliff: no idea. I've been there, I felt that pain too...

[02:41] <Xliff> Seriously? Never figured out the difference?

[02:41] <Xliff> That's....seriously annoying.

[02:41] <vrurg> Could it be different compiler version they use?

[02:42] <Xliff> Well, I'm up to date on git master....

[02:42] <vrurg> In my case it wasn't my faulty code. Don't remember the details though. But yes, it was compiling/working for me but not under CI.

[02:43] <vrurg> I mean, MSVC you use and the one in AppVeyor – are they the same?

[02:43] <Xliff> Oh! No. I'm on Linux!

[02:44] <Xliff> But on AppVeyor, I'm seeing "Multiple exceptions were thrown by LEAVE/POST phasers" which are RAKU level error messages.

[02:44] <Xliff> I'm not seeing any of that, here.

[02:45] <Xliff> Ahhh!

[02:45] <vrurg> Windows, sir! 

[02:45] <Xliff> SET HARNESS_VERBOSE=1

[02:46] <vrurg> Ah, that's what you mean... You just didn't see the message?

[02:46] <vrurg> I thought that the error they produce is not the one you get.

[02:46] <Xliff> Yes.

[02:46] *** sena_kun left
[02:47] <vrurg> TEST_JOBS=1 also results in verbose output, BTW.

[02:47] <Xliff> TEST_JOBS=1 HARNESS_VERBOSE=1 make test # Did the trick!

[02:48] <Xliff> It's sooo nice when you can get actual error messages from make test... :/

[09:22] <linkable6> (2020-01-31) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6c5615ecf1 Merge pull request #3455 from rakudo/cci-precomp-build

[09:24] <bartolin> is that a known problem or should I open an issue. (If I'm not mistaken there has been a merge of IO::Socket::INET related stuff recently.)

[09:24] <bartolin> bbl &

[10:41] <bartolin> I think, I'll go and open an issue.

[11:12] <bartolin> I've openend https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3457

[11:15] <bartolin> hmm, I think I've updated from 11.3-RELEASE-p3 to 11.3-RELEASE-p6 between the two mentioned spectest. To be sure, I'll re-compile with an older commit and see if the tests still pass.

[11:20] <rba> .tell patrickb Sure I have rebuilt the container and restarted it on the two docker runhosts. We need to consider to automate the container build and push it directly into the github docker registry. And I will automate the pull+restart on the runhosts.

[11:20] <tellable6> rba, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[11:29] <nine> bartolin: FWIW I've failed to reproduce the issue on Linux. So I guess it's FreeBSD specific.

[11:40] <bartolin> nine: thanks. I've added that info the the issue.

[14:31] <patrickb> The MacOS and Linux builds were done automatically using the new CircleCI pipeline. Sadly I had to do the Windows build manually as CircleCI currently refuses to do Windows builds because something with how it calculates credits is off.

[15:22] <rba> patrickb: That's why I started thinking about how to handle the persistent data part of the containers...

[15:23] <rba> patrickb: So far I just logged in the the only user using ssh keys and put the volumes in the home of the ranger user manully on the two runhosts.

[15:23] <patrickb> are the releases part of the containers or mounted in?

[15:23] <rba> patrickb: This means I'm open to discuss how we like to handle this...

[15:23] <patrickb> If they are mounted in they can in principle also reside on a different host

[15:27] <patrickb> Two hosts show up. I didn't know this was possible...

[15:27] <rba> patrickb: But maybe I configure the current webhost (which is Ubuntu) to be a docker runhost as well and there we could login and then like remote control the two addtional RancherOS runhost remotely...

[15:28] <rba> patrickb: Two time https is not perfect, as it might lead to ssl handshake issues when one is down. Yet better than going offline totaly...

[15:33] <rba> patrickb: I might try to use rsync to keep the volumes of the containers in sync...

[15:33] <patrickb> rba: So then there is a master server for the synching. Is a plausible approach.
