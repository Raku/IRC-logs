[11:44] <patrickb> I'd like to merge https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3810 soon-ish (far away from the next release). That PR is deprecating a commandline option. I've added a deprecation notice, but I think we never deprecated a commandline option before. Should I merge or wait for more feedback? (From whom?)

[11:50] *** raku-bridge left
[11:51] <JJMerelo> patrickb wait, how much?

[11:51] <patrickb> JJMerelo: I don't understand. Do you mean how long I would wait?

[11:51] <JJMerelo> patrickb I mean, you can wait for ever... 

[11:52] *** raku-bridge joined
[11:52] *** raku-bridge left
[11:52] *** raku-bridge joined
[11:52] <JJMerelo> patrickb the middle way is probably have a small deprecation cycle of one month or until the next release and wait that much.

[11:53] <Altai-man_> patrickb, I'd say a deprecation cycle for a year is good enough, considering it gives a big WARNING on building with this option on.

[11:54] <patrickb> That's why I asked. I hope to either provoke a "merge it now" or "I'll have quick look" response.

[11:56] <timotimo> patrickb: we have a deprecation cycle going on for --profile and friends at the moment

[11:56] <timotimo> i would assume it's fine to merge this. i wonder if Inline::Perl6 needs a tiny patch?

[11:56] <patrickb> timotimo: How did you do that? Just add a 'note "Deprecated. Don't use."' ?

[11:57] <timotimo> it's a little more complicated than that

[11:58] <patrickb> Well, `--nqp-lib` doesn't have any functionality. The deprecation is solely about not complaining when the option is given.

[11:58] <timotimo> right

[11:58] *** JJMerelo left
[11:58] <patrickb> I was mostly concerned whether the deprecation output could have unwanted sideeffects.

[11:58] <timotimo> i need to rebuild my nqp and rakudo, currently heap snapshots die because they don't find nqp-home method on the compiler

[11:59] <Altai-man_> timotimo, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3824 <-

[12:00] <Altai-man_> Also, we must add rakudo-level tests for, at least, zero exit code for profile / heap snapshots features.

[12:00] <timotimo> this got into the release?

[12:00] <Altai-man_> Yes.

[12:00] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/647 <- that's the fix.

[12:00] <Altai-man_> So we're waiting for the fix to be approved-merged, then tests to be added, then point.

[12:00] <timotimo> i'll go write a test or two

[12:00] <patrickb> The merge is currently only waiting for CI.

[12:01] <Altai-man_> timotimo, please do, I will be really happy. We have various rakudo-only tests and it is a bit ouch we did not have _anything_ for the profiler, so this sneaked in.

[12:01] <timotimo> have we considered using bindhllsym here?

[12:04] <patrickb> timotimo: Are you asking about `nqp-home` and `rakudo-home`?

[12:04] <timotimo> yeah

[12:04] <patrickb> If so, they originally used bindhllsym. But the approach caused unwanted duplication and coupling of rakudo and nqp.

[12:05] <patrickb> So using a method on the Compiler object was the best alternative idea we could come up with.

[12:06] <timotimo> it occurs to me that we'll also want a way to pass just a directory rather than a full path to a file

[12:06] <timotimo> to get a combinatin of "rakudo/nqp generates the filename for us" and "we get to choose where the file ends up"

[12:08] <patrickb> timotimo: I remember that it was you who gave the idea of using bindhllsym for this more than a year ago. :-)

[20:10] <timotimo> ah, that landed today

[20:11] * Altai-man_ not sure if kidding or serious

[20:11] <timotimo> the fix i mean

[20:12] <Altai-man_> Ah, yup.

[20:12] <timotimo> we have "is_run" or something in our tests?

[20:12] <Altai-man_> Well, that's why I'm planning to quickly do a point and finally rest for a bit...

[20:19] <sena_kun> timotimo, didn't you mention it to be broken?

[20:19] <timotimo> calling out to rakudo from a test can be super annoying

[20:19] <sena_kun> I had to left though, so maybe misunderstood.

[20:19] <timotimo> like, when you have rakudo-gdb-m or so, it'll use that version there too and give you quite some trouble

[20:20] <sena_kun> timotimo, https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku-dev?date=2020-07-27#l89 <- this seems like exactly the problem, no?

[20:20] <timotimo> right, i didn't look closely enough

[20:21] <sena_kun> I assume the profiler works with the fix, but not sure how to test if heap profiler is and don't want to do another point in case it isn't.

[20:22] <timotimo> ooh we have is-run in t/ and is_run in t/spec/

[20:22] <timotimo> brilliant

[20:23] <sena_kun> timotimo, well, t/spec is roast and we don't want to test profiler there for sure, so rakudo/t is good.

[20:23] <timotimo> yeah

[20:23] <timotimo> i was just worried because i saw no results for is_run outside of t/spec

[20:24] <timotimo> and thought i'd have to come up with something myself, which could very well be brittle and wrong and whatever

[20:57] <sena_kun> lizmat, you need to locally bump nqp.

[20:57] <sena_kun> To see this.

[20:57] <sena_kun> I did not do this because the bump will happen anyway with the release.

[20:57] <lizmat> ok, then I'll wait  :-)

[20:58] <sena_kun> lizmat, can you please do a local bump and double-check? :)

[20:59] <lizmat> I've been burned so many times with local bumps in the past, that I've become really reluctant to do that  :-(

[20:59] *** Xliff joined
[20:59] <sena_kun> No problem, then wait for the release. :)

[21:00] <lizmat> got a bit tired of needing to nuke my install dir

[21:28] <sena_kun> timotimo, "t/09-moar/01-profilers.t ........................................ Dubious, test returned 2 (wstat 512, 0x200)"

[21:29] <timotimo> great!

[21:29] <timotimo> why?

[21:30] <sena_kun> Eeh.

[21:31] <sena_kun> It passes fine when I run it using built rakudo... Weird...

[21:31] <sena_kun> Failed tests:  2-3

[21:33] <timotimo> plenty other tests use is-run successfully, right?

[21:33] <sena_kun> Yeah.

[21:34] <timotimo> grmbl

[21:35] <timotimo> how do i get "make blah.t" to output more than just the ok or not ok lines

[21:35] <sena_kun> Yes, that's the question.

[21:35] <sena_kun> The problem it, the test passes just fine if I run it directly, without make.

[21:35] <sena_kun> Trying again.

[21:36] <timotimo> --no-merge on the harness

[21:40] <sena_kun> Did not help, hmm.

[21:40] <sena_kun> ===(       1;0  0/6   1/12  0/?  0/?  0/?  0/? )========================# Failed test 'profiler html output file exists on disk'

[21:41] <timotimo> yeah, the file does not actually exist

[21:41] <sena_kun> But we test for its existence?

[21:41] <sena_kun> >ok $htmlpath.IO.f, "profiler html output file exists on disk";

[21:41] <sena_kun> The $htmlpath for me is "/tmp/perl6_roast_01_profilers_t_line1_0_41108281079771091595886049/profile.html"

[21:41] <timotimo>     # Writing profiler output to /tmp/perl6_roast_01_profilers_t_line1_0_97792504619008721595886087/profile.html

[21:41] <timotimo>     # Could not locate profiler/template.html; should have been at /home/timo/perl6/share/nqp/lib/profiler/template.html; outputting sql data instead

[21:41] <timotimo>     # Writing profiler output to /tmp/perl6_roast_01_profilers_t_line1_0_97792504619008721595886087/profile.sql

[21:42] <timotimo> there's an install/ missing in the middle

[21:42] <timotimo> /home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp/lib/profiler/template.html exists

[21:42] <sena_kun> So who is wrong?

[21:43] <timotimo> the test is successfully detecting that stuff isn't working

[21:44] <sena_kun> But if I do `install/bin/raku --profile -e 'say "foo"'` it says `Writing profiler output to profile-1595886239.0356207.html` and the file is here and working.

[21:45] <sena_kun> Let me do a bump...

[21:45] <timotimo> nqp::static-nqp-home=/home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp

[21:45] <timotimo> nqp::source-digest=6c4c5320411a7c2bfcf5d1224e20d255671e3bc7

[21:45] <sena_kun> Oh, hm, it's not so easy.

[21:45] <timotimo> nqp::prefix=/home/timo/perl6/install

[21:45] <timotimo> nqp::nqp-home=/home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp

[21:45] <timotimo> nqp::libdir=/home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp/lib

[21:45] <timotimo> these look fine

[21:46] <timotimo> Raku::prefix=/home/timo/perl6/install

[21:46] <timotimo> Raku::static-nqp-home=

[21:46] <timotimo> Raku::static-rakudo-home=/home/timo/perl6/install/share/perl6

[21:47] <timotimo> i wonder why the static-nqp-home there is empty, but probably just not using it? and maybe that's fine? or maybe that's wrong?

[21:49] <sena_kun> Right, it creates .sql instead of .html.

[21:50] <sena_kun> Ok.

[21:50] <timotimo> execname is /home/timo/perl6/rakudo/rakudo-m

[21:50] <sena_kun> This sounds like a legitimate bug...

[21:50] <timotimo> i believe the code we have cuts off two slashes from the end, then just plops /share/perl6 at the end

[21:51] <timotimo> that's in Compiler.nqp in method rakudo-home inside rakudo

[21:52] <timotimo> ok i can reproduce it without "make" now

[21:53] <timotimo> ./rakudo-m -I lib t/09-moar/01-profilers.t inside my rakudo build folder

[21:53] <sena_kun> timotimo, are you sure you are using rakudo with bumped nqp?

[21:54] <timotimo> This is nqp version 2020.07-3-gf0cfdf2d8 built on MoarVM version 2020.07-3-gb56e62f18

[21:55] <sena_kun> Yeah.

[21:55] <sena_kun> timotimo, thanks for writing a test, this is a life saver, huh.

[21:56] <sena_kun> Ok, now sleep.

[21:56] <timotimo> ok, so the code in rakudo will probably go via HLL::Compiler to moar's HLL/Backend, which uses getcomp("default")'s .nqp-home to find the right path

[21:56] <timotimo> good night sena_kun 

[21:57] <timotimo> # execname:     /home/timo/perl6/rakudo/rakudo-m

[21:57] <timotimo> # rakudo-home:  /home/timo/perl6/rakudo/gen/build_rakudo_home

[21:57] <timotimo> # def-nqp-home: /home/timo/perl6/share/nqp

[21:57] <timotimo> these two last ones are both wrong for my installation
