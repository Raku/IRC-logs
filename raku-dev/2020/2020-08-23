[14:06] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man: take it easy

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man: release-2020.08.1 branch is one commit ahead, so releasing from master means that the commit won't be in the release

[14:08] *** dogbert11 left
[14:08] <AlexDaniel> just don't rush and it'll be fine :)

[14:09] <Altai-man> I rebased branches for nqp and rakudo, updated announcement to include a couple of commits which has slipped in 2020.08 (mystery again?) but were not mentioned.

[14:09] <Altai-man> TEST_JOBS=24 VERSION=2020.08.1 VERSION_MOAR=2020.08 BRANCH_ROAST=master BRANCH_RAKUDO=release-2020.08.1 BRANCH_NQP=release-2020.08.1

[14:09] *** dogbert11 joined
[14:09] <Altai-man> Now this looks sane?

[14:10] <AlexDaniel> yeah that looks correct to me, if roast master doesn't have new tests

[14:12] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man: there isn't really a mystery to me. From what it looks like the akefile was working with an old commit 

[14:12] <AlexDaniel> ah… hold on… nevermind

[14:13] <AlexDaniel> yes, the Seq commits by vrurg were in master but were not in the release branch

[14:13] <Altai-man> Yes.

[14:14] <Altai-man> The question is how something completely different was tagged as release, not actual release branch. Not even tagged, but packed an all that.

[14:58] <sena_kun> Now tag 2020.08.1 seems right to me.

[14:58] *** dogbert11 left
[15:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: one thing I'd like to note is that when you push the tag like that there's no way back really

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: there is no real difference between master and other branches, so just because a branch is not merged into master yet doesn't mean anything

[15:04] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: so right now there's a published tag that points at a non-master commit, meaning 2020.08.1 is now released

[15:04] <sena_kun> Yes.

[15:04] <sena_kun> You implying it is time to merge quickly or just clarifying?

[15:04] <AlexDaniel> it's not wrong per se, but I just want to make it clear that this workflow means that people can't look at the PR and suggest fixes because it's too late

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> for future releases you can push your commits without pushing the tags

[15:05] <sena_kun> But 2020.08.1 is saved, right? Or you noticed something after tag and now we're going for 2020.08.2?

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> no issues so far :)

[15:06] <sena_kun> As for noticing things before tagging - yes, this is a good idea.

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> OK there is one issue

[15:07] <sena_kun> Hm?

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> let me double check

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> false alarm :)

[15:08] <sena_kun> Phew.

[15:09] <sena_kun> We can continue then.

[15:09] <sena_kun> I do agree that more eyes looking for the release is better in every possible regard.

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> hoold on…

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> ah again, false alarm xD

[15:10] <sena_kun> However it really boils down to people making things. We are kind of scarce on time resources people have and options are 1)enforce rules like "Two people do release or nobody does"; 2)Do it the usual way, which is error-prone.

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> sorry x)

[15:10] <sena_kun> Are you mocking me?

[15:10] <sena_kun> :)

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> I get confused with all the VERSION files sometimes

[15:10] <nwc10> "continue then" means what? The Perl 5 guide ends with this step: https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/Porting/release_managers_guide.pod#relax

[15:11] <nwc10> is there an equivalent?

[15:11] <nwc10> also, that document is long and irritating because it turned out to be hard to automate many parts

[15:11] <nwc10> or, more accurately, that's what's left *after* things were automated whereever easy.

[15:12] <sena_kun> To be honest, I had to pick up moarvm releases somewhere along the way, because samcv has not so much free time (neither many of moarvm folks we have) and if we want releases be on time, we can't ping everyday "Can you please release, we're ready?".

[15:12] <sena_kun> Otherwise rakudo releases would either stuck or delayed, or you can pack them yourself.

[15:12] <AlexDaniel> nwc10: see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod#steps-to-create-a-release-for-release-managers

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> nwc10: steps 20-22 not really automated

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> nwc10: step 19 is new so I can't comment about it

[15:13] <nwc10> but the aim is to get to 22, and not backtrack? :-)

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> nwc10: step 1 is release prep, there are tools but no automation yet

[15:14] <nwc10> and, thanks for doing this. I'm glad that you're doing it, and I think you're doing a much better job of it than I would (and I really don't reliably have the time)

[15:14] <lizmat> sena_kun: if I do a pull now, should I get a 2020.08 MoarVM ?

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> step 2 is about leap seconds. I never had it happen to me when I was the release manager, and since then it still didn't happen, so no automation for that

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's not in master yet

[15:15] <lizmat> ok

[15:15] <sena_kun> I was going to wait for CI, buuuuuuut...

[15:15] <sena_kun> Maybe I'll do.

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> btw I always wanted to change it to “Celebrate with an inappropriate amount of fun”, that's more like I felt when I was the release manager

[15:17] <sena_kun> Now need to publish moarvm release...

[15:17] <sena_kun> And maybe twitter announcement in an hour or so.

[15:18] <AlexDaniel> nwc10: it feels like many steps can still be automated for perl5

[15:18] <AlexDaniel> tagging and stuff

[15:18] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, it's messy and difficult sometimes, and the more you automate it, the less of it you actually see if things go wrong

[15:20] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/tag/2020.08.1

[15:20] <sena_kun> Once rest of CI is green I'm merging into master.

[15:22] <sena_kun> Thinking about it, thanks to this release I tried to run blin on my own pc and knowing it is times faster here makes future blin checks easier.

[15:22] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[15:22] <AlexDaniel> nice

[15:22] <sena_kun> In docker.

[15:22] <AlexDaniel> even nicer

[15:22] <sena_kun> Just in case you were `hmm` thinking I did it just so.

[15:23] <AlexDaniel> no I'm just a bit surprised that whatever machine you have is actually faster for this kind of work

[15:23] <sena_kun> I posted above it took 2 hours.

[15:23] <AlexDaniel> holy shit

[15:23] <sena_kun> 122 minutes, but network here is shit and IO is always the slowest.

[15:24] <AlexDaniel> how? What are the specs?

[15:24] <sena_kun> Ryzen goes brrrr, ahem, 3900X, 970 EVO, 64 gb of mem.

[15:25] <AlexDaniel> nice

[15:25] <sena_kun> So 24 threads on ~4000 mhz.

[15:25] <AlexDaniel> not sure it can sustain that frequency on all cores at the same time?

[15:25] <sena_kun> 3950X with 32 threads would crunch it faster and rippers would laugh, I guess.

[15:25] <sena_kun> It can.

[15:25] <AlexDaniel> but yes, very very nice

[15:26] * AlexDaniel looks sadly at his 3700X

[15:26] <sena_kun> At least if I trust `watch -n.1 "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"^[c]pu MHz\""` output, I saw it reliably going around 4 ghz for all cores doing boinc.

[15:27] <sena_kun> And on idle all cores are at around 1800-2200.

[15:27] <sena_kun> Well, I was using 7500U until a month ago all this time, so I guess 3700X is nothing to be ashamed of. :P

[15:27] <AlexDaniel> though mine is at 0 on idle, I only use it for our livestreams :P

[15:49] <AlexDaniel> :P

[15:49] <sena_kun> Fair enough. :P

[15:50] <AlexDaniel> I actually don't know why this works. I don't remember.

[15:50] <AlexDaniel> I tried to get branches working for a long long time, and it didn't because there was some kind of blocker

[15:50] <AlexDaniel> then I just touched it and poof now it's working

[15:50] * AlexDaniel shrugs

[15:51] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, thanks a lot for your help with this case, anyway. You are really great and supportive even though you are not a release manager for the time being.

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I'm also not great and not supportive at the same time, as lizmat will probably agree. I'm like a Junction :P

[15:53] <sena_kun> Well, as well I am appreciating how lizmat tirelessly spends time in attempts to make Rakudo better.

[15:53] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: you *can* be a pain

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> sorry

[15:55] <sena_kun> I would like to try to fix a couple of easy rakudo tickets, but firstly need to play a match or something and rest a bit from all this before Comma week.

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> take a well deserved break :) have fun

[15:57] <nwc10> Comma week?

[15:58] <sena_kun> nwc10, Comma complete release next week.

[15:59] <nwc10> aha, that comma

[15:59] <sena_kun> Yup.

[15:59] <nwc10> er, that Comma

[15:59] <nwc10> if it's at the start of a sentance, I didn't realise that it was a proper noun.

[15:59] <nwc10> is the coffee machine ready for this?

[17:13] <sena_kun> dogbert17, this is for master or release?

[17:13] <dogbert17> I just built master

[17:13] <sena_kun> Ah, ok.

[17:13] <sena_kun> As this is not something release build should show.

[17:25] <sena_kun> JJMerelo, if you can edit questions now, "Opción 8" should probably be deleted.

[17:25] <JJMerelo> sena_kun thanks.

[17:25] <JJMerelo> probably nobody heard about Raku that way :-)

[17:26] <JJMerelo> BTW, survey results will be shared with everyone in the community (and a bit of analysis will be done)

[17:26] <sena_kun> JJMerelo, thanks for organizing it.

[17:29] <sena_kun> JJMerelo, also, "What are the top three values you would like to associate with the Raku language in future?" probably does not want options like "too slow" and other negative ones. ;)

[17:29] <JJMerelo> Correct

[17:30] <JJMerelo> sena_kun I guess that's the only one, right?

[17:31] <sena_kun> JJMerelo, hm? Which should be removed? Yes, I think. Maybe it wants "fast" option as well instead.

[17:32] <JJMerelo> OK, added high performance

[21:53] <timotimo> it's direct syntax for a complex literal

[21:53] <timotimo> whereas 0+1i relies on constant folding a little later down the line to give a Complex
