[02:16] <tellable6> vrurg, I saw altai-man 2020-04-29T16:33:15Z in #raku: <Altai-man_> Chicken-egg problem. Who will adapt the software if everyone says "Oh, so it is not adapted yet, we'll wait till someone else adapts that".

[02:18] <vrurg> .tell Altai-man I think we could try unrolling the next-dispatcher stuff to unblock releases.

[04:43] <guifa2> Interesting.  I can't find anywhere how <{ ... }> works in regex.  Per the grammar, assert is defined as '<' ~ '>' <assertion>, but there is no assertion that includes braces and a codeblock.

[04:44] <guifa2> I mean, it's easy enough for me to implement in binex, by just adding '{' ~ '}' <codeblock> as an assertion

[06:42] <MasterDuke> guifa2: don't know in the grammar, but the implementation is in INTERPOLATE and INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION i believe. could try to find out how they get called

[08:16] <Kaiepi> so... turns out there is a way to handle binding and listening sockets separately for the jvm for that bind before connect pr!

[14:41] <vrurg> It wasn't good idea to revert in roast. Mark as TODO is more correct.

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> why?

[14:42] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, to not forget to bring it back once we have proper impl, maybe?

[14:43] <sena_kun> vrurg, can dispatcher reverts lead to races in case if something was not undone properly?

[15:05] <vrurg> Altai-man_: In either case, we'd need to test it first.

[15:05] * vrurg is afk again.

[15:05] <Altai-man_> vrurg, e.g. I saw failures in stresstest files, e.g. https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S01-perl-5-integration/method.t but not reproducible.

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: can you try it?

[15:44] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, I am using an image created 8 days ago, but it sayd endpoint is not found, do I need a more recent version?

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: yes

[15:44] <Altai-man_> Ok, will build one, thanks!

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: just tested it like this: --new=dispatcher-revert

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> that is, without even providing a SHA

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> it works. Magic
