[14:04] <tellable6> 2019-10-02T11:24:54Z #perl6-dev <tbrowder> ugexe does Build.pm6 need to be listed somehow in the META6.json file?

[14:04] <tellable6> 2019-10-02T17:50:36Z #perl6-dev <tbrowder> ugexe the zef build problem seems to be an incompletely unquoted cmd string in the legacy build module. see new issue #319

[14:05] <ugexe> i dont want to review 5 separate commits to master

[14:05] *** Altai-man_ left
[14:07] <lizmat> ugexe: you only need to review https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9e9851a808 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2f6677b2d1 really

[14:07] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[14:07] <ugexe> the other commits are related

[14:08] <ugexe> there are 3 related commits

[14:10] <ugexe> one as a reviewer i do not like the feeling of the clock counting down

[14:10] <ugexe> and that is certainly the case when commiting directly to master

[14:11] <ugexe> i have to not only make sure the code isn't going to cause a regression in a case that isn't covered obviously somewhere, but to make sure the design out of that subsystem itself is ideal (which is completely separate)

[14:12] <ugexe> to get a better error message for a pretty non-common case?

[14:13] <ugexe> anywho i have a problem-solving ticket open that asks why we don't require review process for interface changes, so i've tried to address this more generally already

[18:30] <sena_kun> I can see benefit of using branches. For example, with the match refactoring branch we could try out some ideas safely and seeing it isn't really simple to fix, can just put it away until a better time. No need to revert-re-revert in master.

[18:41] <lizmat> sena_kun: my mistakes were a. not pushing a roast change making the check less specific, b. not testing the cherry-pick I did afterwards

[18:42] <lizmat> this broke CI twice, and made people angry

[18:42] <sena_kun> lizmat, I wonder what is the policy about exception types.

[18:42] <ugexe> it broke CI twice for what value? the second time it was added it is essentially dead code

[18:43] <lizmat> [20:04:35]  <ugexe>	so, for the second time today master is failing its own tests

[18:43] <ugexe> sure it might make sense in the context of the solution to the greater problem, but then it belong grouped with that solution

[18:44] <sena_kun> Because it is clearly the gray zone and can be argued either way "Yes, it bends the canonical interpretation of roast" and "No, that should not be specced".

[18:44] <lizmat> sena_kun: wrt exception types, I also wonder

[18:45] <lizmat> but I guess the booboo was that something that *was* an exception before, wasn't anymore

[18:45] <lizmat> in any case, I will give myself some time off of doing any commits until at least the release

[18:46] <sena_kun> The release is pretty clear, by the way.

[18:46] <sena_kun> Blin is happy, so needs some packing.
