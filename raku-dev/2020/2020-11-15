[14:54] <lizmat> "An error occurred while generating the build script."

[14:54] <lizmat> that's one of the reasons I stopped using Travis for my personal projects, too many false negatives

[14:55] <Altai-man> Azure builds are ok.

[14:55] <lizmat> yeah, maybe we should retire Travis altogether ?

[14:55] <Altai-man> That's what I was thinking we are going to do, but the efforts was maybe not coordinated enough.

[14:56] <lizmat> I mean, I'm using Github Actions for my own projects now, which typically comes back within minutes if there's something wrong

[14:56] <lizmat> Travis generally took over an hour to get back, and then often wrong

[14:56] <Altai-man> I think what blocks that is 1)unclear status of e.g. build restart action availability for all core devs; 2)unclear status if azure completely covers _everything_ travis covers.

[14:56] <lizmat> I realize it could  well be how it was set up, put I didn't want to put in the effort to figure out how to make that work better

[14:57] <lizmat> and then we have rakudist  :-)

[22:32] <melezhik2> It could allow on my view to test rakudo commits, using web UI and share results within team ...

[22:40] <melezhik> the same fashion rakudist does

[22:41] <melezhik> and because code would run in mortal docker containers, it even will be possible to install system packages, if use wish so, so for example to check external libraries code

[22:42] <melezhik> use -> user
