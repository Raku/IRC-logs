[13:35] <lizmat> is there a reason why it wouldn't be ok to make $?DISTRIBUTION a lexical in the mainline of the compunit ?

[13:36] <lizmat> instead of a WVAL, which it is now ?

[13:38] <lizmat> and mark it as "dynamic" so that methods in the MOP would be able to get at it using nqp::getlexcaller

[13:40] <lizmat> hmmm  probably not dynamic
