[09:05] <Geth> ¦ JSON-Unmarshal/issue-7: A type that implemented Positional but has accessors (so presumably is

[11:56] <[Coke]> other failures now, will post

[11:56] <[Coke]> (doing a full xtest)

[11:56] <lizmat> ah, ok :-)

[11:57] <[Coke]> meta6 test failings since I can't reinstall the module...

[11:57] <lizmat> that's an unrelated issue afaik

[11:58] <[Coke]> agreed

[12:02] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/01d6377df45fe26657daf2f3c7042313 - some example compilation errors that are pod related, and whitespace issue in one of the examples (these might not be related to your recent changes directly)

[12:02] <[Coke]> 2 of the 4 failing test files are due to missing dependencies, ignore those. checking the 03-tests-valid.rakutest ...

[12:03] <[Coke]> ... ah, also missing deps.

[12:05] <[Coke]> so just the examples-compilation errors. all the comparison errors are gone, lizmat++

[12:05] <lizmat> whee!

[12:07] <[Coke]> If someone can take a look at the example compilation issues in the gist, I'd appreciate it. Guessing they are tangential to recent pod cleanups

[12:08] <[Coke]> (someone other than lizmat, this is a good intro problem)

[12:08] <[Coke]> ... this is the wrong window. Sorry, folks!

[12:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: if they share the same additional adverbs.  This is possible because

[12:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: the actual stopper for heredocs operates on the $*DELIM dynamic variable.

[14:29] <[Coke]> do we have a way to track release blockers?

[14:29] <[Coke]> (fixing the breakage on the META6 module should qualify, IMO)

[14:30] <lizmat> make an issue and mark it as "BLOCKER" ?

[14:39] <[Coke]> ok, didn't know we had a tag already. I'll make a rakudo/rakudo issue linked to the PS issue.

[14:47] <[Coke]> er, community modules, not PS.

[14:49] * [Coke] openend https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5318

[15:04] <[Coke]> also blocks installing (e.g.) Text::CSV

[17:46] <[Coke]> wonder if an ` zef-deps --inverse` would be handy (if slow)

[17:47] <[Coke]> would love it for #5318 so we could see all the modules that depend on getting the breakage fixed.
