[00:27] <[Coke]> tonyo: most folks adding content just add the text, you don't have to worry about building and running the site.

[00:32] <tonyo> i'll try that

[00:32] <tonyo> i'm adding a big section and am not very goodat pod

[11:57] <lizmat> nine: do we have a way to wrap / unwrap Maps ?

[11:58] <lizmat> doesn't look like it?

[12:00] *** reportable6 left
[12:01] *** reportable6 joined
[12:01] <nine> Haven't needed that so ar

[12:01] <nine> so far

[12:01] <lizmat> I think I'm gonna need it for handling the config arguments to a Pod::Block

[12:02] <lizmat> if we want to be able to create a RakuAST::Pod::Block from code

[12:06] <lizmat> nine: do you see anything wrong with this: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/fa97d61ed513d1fce92deb01d464e983

[12:06] <nine> Do we really need it everywhere?

[12:07] <lizmat> what would be against it having it everywhere ?

[12:07] <lizmat> sure I can localize it to Pod::Block

[12:07] <nine> Right...they are IMPL methods anyway

[12:08] <lizmat> anyways, adding that, the build of the bootstrap fails with:

[12:08] <lizmat> +++ Compiling	blib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.moarvm

[12:08] <lizmat> Iteration past end of iterator

[12:08] <lizmat>    at NQP::src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp:652 

[12:11] <lizmat> ah, it appears nqp::hash($map) is problematic

[12:18] <nine> Yeah, what would that even do?

[12:43] <lizmat> indeed... replaced that with an nqp::die  :-)

[14:08] * lizmat is suddenly struck by the incongruity of Pod class naming

[14:09] <lizmat> Pod::Block::Declarator doesn't need to be a Pod::Block, but (was)

[14:09] <lizmat> Pod::Heading/FormattingCode/Item/Defn/Config/Raw *are* Pod::Blocks, but that isn't reflected in their nae

[14:09] <lizmat> *name

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Changes are welcome, probably üòõ

[14:22] <lizmat> I'm more considering setting up a new hierarchy for 6.e

[14:31] *** Xliff joined
[14:31] <lizmat> but since RakuAST needs to run on 6.c as well, first that needs to be supported

[14:45] <lizmat> Q: is there a syntax to create a Pod::Block::Para block *with* configuration parameters ?

[14:49] <tonyo> lizmat: going to do it today

[14:49] <lizmat> ++tonyo 

[15:06] *** Xliff left
[15:07] <[Coke]> tonyo: thanks for the doc patch

[16:00] <tonyo> [Coke]: np, i think i'm going to have another as libera permits us to add `zef` as a project worthy of having it's own #

[16:03] <lizmat> tonyo: not #raku-zef ?

[16:04] <lizmat> I could set that up with logging and everything quite quickly under the #raku / RSC umbrella

[16:04] <lizmat> of course, if you don't want that, that's ok as well  :-)

[16:16] <tonyo> oh, i've always wanted a project :)

[16:16] <tonyo> blog post is incoming

[16:16] <tonyo> pinging ugexe 

[16:18] <ugexe> i guess i would ask what is the purpose of having the prefix? are there multiple open source projects called 'zef' where that prefix would actually be helpful? if an unrelated open source project named zef is created in the future would it not be confusing for some other project to have the #zef room?

[16:19] <ugexe> like cargo doesn't use #rust-cargo, it uses #cargo

[16:19] <lizmat> ugexe tonyo well, it was a suggestion, nothing else...  an invitation if you will

[16:21] <tonyo> much appreciated too, lizmat 

[16:23] <tonyo> any moment now github will finish rebuilding my site and the dist management stuff will have a post

[16:24] <ugexe> im fine with it being under the raku / RSC umbrella, but prefer the name #zef to #raku-zef

[16:24] <lizmat> I think technically it would need to have the prefix, and I don't know how Libera would like the RSC to occupy 2 prefixes

[16:27] <ugexe> i see

[17:31] <lizmat> anyway, that was my impression

[17:31] <lizmat> TIL that "=head1 # Foo"  is shorthand for "=head1 :numbered Foo"

[17:32] <lizmat> except that *that* doesn't parse that way

[17:34] <lizmat> you would need to do "=for head1 :numbered‚ê§Foo"

[17:34] <lizmat> with the newline being mandatory

[21:42] <lizmat> it is...
