[14:39] <[Tux]> I was working on system hardware statistics for infrastructure administration at $work (how old is that system, what OS is it running, what is the patch level, what network connections does it have, etc etc)

[14:40] <[Tux]> and I found (with help) that `stat /` shows the 'Birth' entry which is when the system was first installed (unless you swapped disks)

[14:41] <[Tux]> The home bos where my timings come from is aparently from June 2013, so 10½ years old

[14:41] <[Tux]> and still going strong

[20:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Don't open handles when calling Distribution.content

[20:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[20:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Other distribution objects do not return an opened handle (see `Distribution::Locally`), which was the original intention since the user may want to open the handle with a different encoding or may not be interested in opening the handle at all.
