[17:01] <[Coke]> (So it looks like on yours it's replacing things in order found in the string, not in the order in the replacement list)

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> which kinda sorta makes sense in itself

[17:30] <lizmat> m: say "eightwo".trans(("two", "eight") => (2,8))   # looks like indeed the first seen

[17:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: lizmat self-unassigned Use of lookbehind assertions in .trans hangs rakudo https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5488

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> lol

[18:02] <lizmat> yeah, that's a can of worms that will need quite a lot more thought, so no quick fix by me here
