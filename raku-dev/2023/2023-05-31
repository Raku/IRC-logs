[14:06] <jdv> ok, thanks

[14:07] * jdv wonders if this stuff is tested...:)

[14:08] <lizmat> it wasn't

[14:08] <jdv> please don't touch that branch anymore - the "release tools" manipulate it and it may foul things

[14:08] <lizmat> that was my final tweak on that branch

[14:08] <lizmat> the typo broke several examples in my last series of blog posts about RakuAST

[14:09] <lizmat> thanks for putting up with this stupidity!

[14:12] <jdv> no big deal, but i am actually at the part of the release where that branch needs to be hands off til the end
