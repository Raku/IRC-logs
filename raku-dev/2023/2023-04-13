[10:19] <lizmat> yes

[10:20] <lizmat> so I guess we will need to change it to actually having a $=finish var after all

[18:30] <lizmat> nine: re https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/blob/master/lib/Inline/Perl5.pm6#L1403

[18:31] <lizmat> so I should add $=pod and $=finish to the declarations if CompUnit.PRODUCE-IMPLICIT-DECLARATIONS ?

[18:34] <lizmat> and then QAST the accesses as RakuAST::Var::Lexical ? 

[18:35] <nine> I don't think I understand

[18:35] <lizmat> currently $=pod and $=finish are QASTed as WVal / SVal

[18:35] <lizmat> which is different from the legacy grammar

[18:36] <lizmat> which would cause problems with Inline::Perl5

[18:39] *** sena_kun left
[18:41] <nine> What does the legacy grammar generate?

[18:41] *** sena_kun joined
[18:48] <lizmat> QAST::Var(lexical $=pod)

[18:48] <lizmat> and QAST::Var(lexical $=pod :decl(static))  in the compunit

[18:51] <nine> Oh, now I understand. So $=pod right now code gens as QAST::SVal instead of the variable access and the variable itself doesn't really exist and therefore is not available through CALLER::

[18:51] <lizmat> right

[18:51] <nine> Yeah, it must be a real variable that gets added to the comp unit

[18:51] <nine> Not too different from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/51c3b7bd3f
