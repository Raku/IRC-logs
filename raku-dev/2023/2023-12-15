[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 5606fb657c | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | src/core.c/Match.rakumod

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Make Match.print more aware of its surroundings

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The Match.print method is being use in two ways:

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - as the <print> token

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - as the method to output $/ or derivative to STDOUT

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This was causing problems, e.g. described in #5468.

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 10 more lines…>

[10:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5606fb657c

[10:56] <lizmat> nemokosch ^^

[11:02] <lizmat> m: "foo" ~~ / <print>+ /; $/.print

[11:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2d1ce780b: OUTPUT: «!cursor_start_cur cannot restart a cursor␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:02] <lizmat> this works in 5606fb657c

[11:02] <linkable6> (2023-12-15) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5606fb657c Make Match.print more aware of its surroundings

[11:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is $¢ ?

[11:08] <lizmat> I guess I would describe it as an NQP remnant of the regex engine and the time where the cursor and Match object were separate entities

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hmm, gotcha

[11:34] <lizmat> m: "foo" ~~ / <print>+ /; $/.print

[11:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5606fb657: OUTPUT: «foo»

[12:55] <ab5tract> .vushu: would you be interested / available to write an Raku Advent article about your modules? I think people would be really interested to read about your bindings generator, for instance

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ab5tract sure I can proably write something.

[13:20] <ugexe> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38652339 - "Let it snow in your terminal" (python) on the front page

[14:45] <lizmat> .vushu  that would be really cool and appreciated!
