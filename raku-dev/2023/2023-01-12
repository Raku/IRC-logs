[17:24] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1a31c3bf5d - should those class comments be using POD prefix-block comments, or is that too much for internals?

[18:58] <lizmat> [Coke] anything in src/Raku/ast is a weird mix of NQP and Rakudo pseudo-code

[18:58] <lizmat> used to create the Raku bootstrap

[18:59] <lizmat> it basically gets concatenated, then runs a grammar that creates the NQP code to create the Raku bootstrap

[18:59] <lizmat> it doesn't handle pod afaik :-)

[19:42] <vrurg> Slightly other way around: first compiled into NQP then concatenated.
