[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Implement methods `andthen` and `orelse` on Promise

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The methods are intended to simplify conditional processing and chaining

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: of kept or broken promises when used instead of the `then` method.

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: `andthen` is fired only when its invocant promise is kept. If the

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: invocant is broken then its cause becomes the cause of the promise

[09:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 8 more lines…>

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Rather than just being abbreviated or not, it can now also be marked

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - adds :for and :directive named arguments to .new

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Turns out we will need to have this information kept with rakudoc

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: blocks, to spot errors in leading whitespace and to get deparsing

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: that is closer to the original.

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This doesn't actually handle deparsing just yet, as that will

[11:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: require a more thorough overhaul.
