[12:13] <tbrowder__> howdy, i'm just using DISTRIBUTION in my code and find its method .content($path) to be confusing. it's not content, it's an open file handle (IO::Handle i think). seems to me its name should better reflect its action

[12:16] <tbrowder__> 'content' to me says it's already been slurped

[12:18] <tbrowder__> i would file an issue if anyone agrees with me

[12:44] <tbrowder__> name it something like “.handle” or “.io-handle”

[12:45] <tbrowder__> or “.file-handle”

[12:46] <tbrowder__> keep the existing name and deprecate it as usual

[12:54] <ugexe> Disagree 

[12:55] <ugexe> it’s a handle because it might not be backed by a file 

[12:57] <ugexe> We have return types partly to tell you what it is. You don’t name the function after what something returns 

[13:09] <ab5tract> lizmat: how deeply tied to the current find-nodes implementation are you?

[13:09] <tellable6> ab5tract, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[13:11] <ab5tract> because I need a different version of it and I don't know whether to replace the existing one or to add a new 'find-methods-exclusive' that adds what I need (a full Code version of :stopper and exclusion of any elements matching :stopper regardless of whether they meet :condition)

[13:12] <ab5tract> s/find-methods/find-nodes/

[13:26] <tbrowder__> ugexe: thnx, pls all disregard my input ref .content
