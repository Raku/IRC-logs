[14:25] <[Coke]> looks like jvm is broken, trying to bisect (SO SLOW), went back 2 release, and that had a completely different failure.

[14:25] <[Coke]> we should do a bare minimum check on JVM&JS backends for each release.

[14:33] <[Coke]> 2023.06 has the same failure as 2023.05 (not current failure)

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> absolutely unsurprising. Is there anyone who is maintaining even JVM (let alone JS which is probably broken for a long time) at the moment?

[14:35] <ugexe> i think when it started failing for the JVM it ran out of memory. i think i noticed this some months after it started, but when i raised the memory limit there was a new failure (the BOOTInt one) that had to have occured sometime after the JVM stoppped working initially

[14:36] <ugexe> avoiding these situations is a boon of a workflow that only merges green CI runs

[14:37] <[Coke]> oh, so this was not a new failure but a revealed one? then this bisect is useless, I bet.

[14:38] <[Coke]> (merge only green) yes, please.

[14:38] <ugexe> yeah, you'd have to somehow get https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5309 in for commits where the failing started

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that would probably open Pandora's box, whether that's a good thing or not...

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ultimately, even MoarVM is in a sorry state. There are like 3 people working on it and nobody to consolidate issues or PR's. It's all ad-hoc.

[14:47] <lizmat> re the BOOTint failure: do we have a full stacktrace of that?  if so, please make an issue with it and I'll look at it later today

[15:06] <[Coke]> lizmat: there's an issue. don't have a stacktrace.

[15:07] <[Coke]> will see if I can make one.

[15:08] <ugexe> https://dev.azure.com/Rakudo/rakudo/_build/results?buildId=4380&view=logs&j=4b893f53-7e1e-5c61-1e1e-e4fc61ee1c48&t=eecb2d6d-5078-534f-db49-36810221fdff&l=72

[15:14] <[Coke]> oh, that is in the ticket, yes.

[15:16] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5337

[15:16] <ugexe> seems like maybe something to do with the value used for the indent level

[15:17] <[Coke]> I don't know where that Metamodel file is. 

[15:19] <ugexe> it gets generated, so i suspect if you tried to build locally that it would show up 

[15:27] <[Coke]> ah, I didn't finish a rebuild at head.

[15:50] <[Coke]> make -j might also be broken for jvm

[15:50] <[Coke]> (though I did just have to reboot halfway through, who knows)

[16:05] *** codesections joined
[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://raku.org/compilers/features.html this page is also generated from an archived repo

[16:32] <[Coke]> the line it's complaining about bootint on is             nqp::die($die_message)

[16:33] <[Coke]> nemo: "why not pugs" link goes nowhere and can be removed at some point.

[16:34] <ugexe> what is calling the nqp::die though

[16:35] <ugexe> the nqp::die is probably trying to generate a different error message with indentation, but it also fails to parse whatever value indent is

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah well, my point is that this whole thing may be best to be removed...

[16:42] <[Coke]> (remove) that's fine with me. was most helpful when the .net version was a going concern.

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also, there are "snippets". Here is an example: https://raku.org/snippets/99-bottles.html

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's very apparent that this isn't meant to show up in itself; it's probably a template

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yet to find where it appears

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the reason this matters is that only these "snippets" require a highlight feature

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think it's unused... the index page, for example, has the highlighting hard-coded

[17:18] *** linkable6 left
[17:18] *** evalable6 left
[17:20] <[Coke]> might be from the examples site?

[17:20] <[Coke]> but yes, we should update those to use the same highlighting as we use in docs

[17:21] *** linkable6 joined
[17:21] *** evalable6 joined
[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for the time being, I'd try to minimize the costs. We don't have a great long-term solution for highlighting

[21:01] * [Coke] wonders if https://jmespath.org/ would be useful in raku, or if the fact that we can easily convert json to raku objects means we don't need a syntax to search inside of the object.

[21:01] <[Coke]> Would this be of use to anyone?

[21:01] <[Coke]> (asking in -dev to avoid some noise)

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the cost-benefit doesn't look great on that one /2c
