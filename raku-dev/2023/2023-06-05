[07:14] <gfldex> Is there a way to attach a sub to a proto so to have a bunch of subs participate in the same MMD but have different names?

[07:25] <gfldex> I guess I can mixin a role with method name.

[07:36] <gfldex> solved by using my own brain (for a change) https://gist.github.com/gfldex/939d6b4f7a3671813a8c1caa2920842c

[08:10] <gfldex> The trait is called on the proto, not the multi candidates. :-|

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> pretty sure multi dispatch candidates are not first-class subroutines

[09:08] <lizmat> a trait is just a sub that gets called at compile time

[09:09] <lizmat> gfldex: I think having a trait on a candidate, would call that trait on that candidate

[09:09] <lizmat> if not, you could try something like

[09:09] <lizmat> BEGIN trait_mod:<foo>(&candidate, params)

[09:21] <nine> Multi dispatch candidates are very much first-class subroutines. The only difference really is that instead of getting referenced by their own lexicals they get added to the proto's candidates list.

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> after a while you lose track where you got certain information from but I can only say, I'm pretty sure I have read or overheard that in exactly the kind of regards traits would require, multi candidates do not stand on their own
