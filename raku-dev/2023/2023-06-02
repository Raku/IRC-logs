[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: Rename Pod::Data to Hashray

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: 

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: Because it is a more generally useful data structure.

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: 

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: The Hashray acts as a Hash when accessed as an Associative.  And

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray: as an Array when accessed as a Positional.

[11:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-Hashray:

[13:18] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[13:18] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: As inspired by https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4236#issuecomment-1384820489

[13:18] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: but sadly this only appears to have a marginal effect on the golfed code (with

[13:40] <nine> lizmat: I'd guess that what takes so much memory is not the @substates array itself, but the stored items

[14:07] <[Coke]> any devs going to the TPRF conference in Canada?

[14:31] <lizmat> nine: yes, but still it felt worthwhile anyway

[14:59] <lizmat> jdv: could it be you forgot to tag MoarVM / nqp 2023.06 ?

[15:01] <jdv> huh?

[15:01] <jdv> it was may 2 days ago so its 05

[15:03] <lizmat> yeah duh, realized it now  :-)

[15:05] <lizmat> thanks again for all the hard work ...  

[15:08] <[Coke]> jdv++

[15:08] <jdv> no big deal

[15:20] <timo> nine: it looks kind of like the substates array isn't at fault after all? this code should also only run when the regex is compiled, so running a string with more "d" characters, or re-running the same code shouldn't increase memory usage from that since the code shouldn't run more than once anyway?

[15:24] <timo> the code spends about half its time in mo

[15:24] <timo> memmove

[15:29] *** codesections1 joined
[15:30] <nine> Do substates themselves contain arrays?

[15:31] <timo> hm, probably

[15:33] <lizmat> yes

[15:33] <nine> My guess is that those are the majority of the leak
