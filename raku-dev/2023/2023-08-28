[03:57] <MasterDuke> huh. i don't know why changing `my $combination := $!combination; ...; nqp::clone($combination)` to `my $combination := nqp::create(IterationBuffer); ...; $combination` results in Cannot unbox a type object (VMNull) to int.

[08:49] <ab5tract> so close..

[08:49] <ab5tract> I even fixed Package:auth<Foo>:api<1>:ver:<12.12>

[08:50] <ab5tract> that didn't move any test files either, but it made some more tests in t/spec/S14-roles/basic.t pass

[08:51] <ab5tract> m: my $content = 'role A { method m() { self.x} }; class B does A { has $.x = 42; method m() { self.A::m() } }; dd B.new.m';  shell Q:scalar<RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 $*EXECUTABLE -e '$content'>

[08:51] <ab5tract> that's the only blocker now

[08:52] <ab5tract> if anyone has any ideas, however concrete, I'd love to push this over the finish line

[08:53] <ab5tract> maybe something is missing during role composition time?
