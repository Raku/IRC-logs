[00:56] <[Coke]> anyone "own" raku.org?

[00:57] <[Coke]> I've been doing PRs for some small stuff, but don't know if anyone cares.

[00:57] <[Coke]> (... enough if I just push to master)

[13:05] <[Coke]> thanks, lizmat.

[13:31] <coleman> [Coke] I got your messages on GitHub. I haven't looked at raku.org's deployment before, but I can investigate this saturday

[13:32] <coleman> Interviews until then

[14:15] <[Coke]> coleman - i think the hope is that we eventually switch to the non p5 version. I think none of the issues I tagged you on last night are critical.

[14:16] <[Coke]> I was able to get the p5 version running locally but without something like nginx in front of it, all the links are broken (/foo vs. /foo/index.html)

[14:17] <[Coke]> (so much faster to install via rakubrew than perlbrew, btw on the m2)

[14:18] *** lizmat left
[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes but it did kind of work locally with plackup as well

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, today I have time to have another go to craft a Caddy image

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> last time I tried, it "ran" but I couldn't actually access anything

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the configuration of the doc site is not immediately reusable the least to say

[16:26] <[Coke]> lizmat: https://planet.raku.org/ is you these days, yes?

[16:30] <lizmat> eh, no?   

[16:30] <lizmat> there's a repo for it  and it appears to update from the repo

[16:31] <[Coke]> ok - readme says to ping *me* in irc chat. :)

[16:31] <[Coke]> (for raku.org)

[16:33] <lizmat> PRs welcome :-)

[16:34] <[Coke]> yah, glad I asked I was just going to swap your name out

[18:00] <[Coke]> lizmat, you can close https://github.com/Raku/planet.raku.org/issues/8

[18:00] <[Coke]> (i'm not logged into github on this box currently or I'd do it)

[19:10] <[Coke]> do some OS'es actually support an irc:// URL?

[19:11] <lizmat> latest MacOS doesn\t

[19:11] <lizmat> at least not in Safari

[19:22] <[Coke]> codesections: any thoughts on https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/192

[19:48] *** buildable6 left

[20:13] <[Coke]> I'm going to take over raku.org/whatever and make it just IDEs, but not change the URL, only the menu header. This work for folks?

[20:14] <[Coke]> I can also change the URL itself, but I figure that opens a can of worms about redirects we can deal with later.

[20:14] <[Coke]> worst case I can do a meta redirect

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> will be funny to consolidate the templates

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but no worries, I don't assume you learn something very mowyw-specific suddently...

[20:20] <[Coke]> no, I'd only do something right now that is pure html, probably

[21:15] <[Coke]> Gabor's screencasts say "but for now Perl 6 remains a dream or a research project"

[21:15] <[Coke]> I think we should remove the links to that.

[21:15] <[Coke]> I'll open a ticket for people to comment on.

[21:18] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/209 - please add any comments there, I'll remove them in a few days

[21:25] <[Coke]> I am finding the menus are not updated automatically. Each page seems to be cached. Not sure if there's an easy way to bust the cache given the site is intended to be mostly static

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh the menus?

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> they come from a template

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and I think that template uses some shared state to mark the current menu item visited

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/blob/master/includes/menu-nav

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if the menus change, probably all source files that link to it need to be regenerated

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> same goes for all files in includes/

[21:40] <[Coke]> if I refresh, it's fine

[21:40] <[Coke]> it's a browser cache issue, not a content regen issue.

[21:48] <[Coke]> Anyone know who this is? https://www.youtube.com/@Perl6Now/

[21:48] <[Coke]> We are linking to their video playlists, but it's all Perl 6 branded.

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's interesting... what even could be cached about the structure of an HTML file

[22:13] *** samebchase left
[22:13] *** samebchase joined
[22:14] <[Coke]> it'san http cache, not an html cache

[22:15] <[Coke]> I'm am assuming the nginx has some small cache time defined.

[22:15] <[Coke]> I haven't verified this, just have seen this kind of thing before

[22:44] *** sena_kun left
[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean sure, I just don't recall this happening with HTML of all browser media
