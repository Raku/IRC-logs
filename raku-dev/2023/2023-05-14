[18:21] <lizmat> TIL you can have Z<comment> markup inside a table cell, but no other markup

[19:10] <gfldex> I'm looking for mainline-code in a role body in S14-roles and can't find any. Do I need better glasses or is this ENOSPEC?

[19:10] <lizmat> well, I can tell you how it's implemented

[19:11] <gfldex> I would be very surprised if you couldn't but that wasn't my question. :->

[19:12] <gfldex> I'm asking because I can't file an ENODOC unless it's !ENOSPEC.

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: more =table fixes

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make sure offsets point at the start of a cell for both rows with

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   visible dividers, as well as with invidible dividers

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - handle lines that start with a visible divider properly

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - allow for Z<markup> inside table cells

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - remove all common leading whitespace before parsing

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - having only a header divider and a single footer divider no longer

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   implies the cells inbetween are multi-line cells

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make sure that missing trailing cells are properly podified

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e92e6f2fd5

[19:18] <lizmat> gfldex:  there are tests for it, so it *is* spec

[19:18] <lizmat> so an ENODOC issue should be filed

[19:18] <lizmat> afk&

[19:22] <Xliff> Can RakuAST be used to emit need statements, yet?

[21:46] <lizmat> Xliff: there's a class RakuAST::Statement::Need class

[22:03] *** sena_kun left
[22:52] <Xliff> lizmat: Thanks.

[22:52] <Xliff> I'll try it and see if it works via EVAL.

[22:58] <Xliff> Hah! I need nodes in module-names....

[23:01] <Xliff> lizmat: Quick question for you...

[23:02] <Xliff> See the list here? https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GooCanvas/blob/main/lib/Goo/Raw/Types.pm6

[23:02] <Xliff> That's what I was hoping RakuAST could make reusable.

[23:03] <Xliff> I would like to make each project emit a tree of Need statements that can be evaluated and then executed. 

[23:03] <Xliff> Is RakuAST to the point where something like that will work?

[23:20] <Xliff> Yeah. Deparses fine, but doesn't work.

[23:20] <Xliff> :(

[23:20] <Xliff> Oh well... maybe next month?

[23:21] <Xliff> I am patient and hopeful. Thanks for all of your hard work, everyone!
