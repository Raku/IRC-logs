[00:59] <[Coke]> anyone on apple silicon using OpenSSL module?

[01:00] <[Coke]> the runtime tests complain that it's the wrong architecture - I installed it with brew, why would brew give me the wrong one?

[01:00] <[Coke]> (or, why is nativecall using the wrong one?)

[01:17] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/2d5ecb5c41c4d5382af2454bd0d9c71f

[01:17] <[Coke]> yah, the error is saying it has arm64 but needs x86_64?

[01:25] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/util/clean-spell - this use to run for ages, but now dies pretty quickly with "Too many open files" - any ideas?

[01:30] <[Coke]> found it tempfile is returning an IO that is just hanging out. I don't see a way using that module to not get the IO object, so I just close it immediately. "close enough"

[01:31] <tonyo> [Coke]: yea..it usually works after --/test

[01:32] <[Coke]> ... holy crap is this fast now. Probably the first time I've run it on the m2.

[01:32] <[Coke]> ... if I install it without the tests, how do I know it's working??

[01:32] <tonyo> it'll also gripe about something being deprecated constantly unless OpenSSL is fixed

[01:32] <tonyo> but it'll still work

[01:40] <[Coke]> ... but why do the tests fail?

[01:40] <[Coke]> Let's fix that. :)
