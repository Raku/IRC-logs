[15:40] <ugexe> MasterDuke: your code changes won't fix long paths on windows yet. and in fact it technically regresses it (although in a way to not be concerned about)

[15:41] <ugexe> the regression is that previous mkdir could create a path like C:\ReallyLongPath (although it would be reported that it wasn't created, and other than see that the folder exists outside of the raku program you cant do anything with that path because all other functions can't handle C:\ReallyLongPath)

[15:41] <ugexe> why? because the current mkdir uses GetFullPathNameW() to turn C:\ReallyLongPath into \\.\C:\ReallyLongPath

[15:46] <ugexe> however with your changes rakudo could start sending paths like `\\.\C:\ReallyLongPath` and that conversion wouldn't be needed in MoarVM in the first place

[15:46] <ugexe> so i suspect what we want to know is if the number of spectest failures changes on windows before and after your changes
