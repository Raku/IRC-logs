[09:50] <bartolin> lizmat: I saw that you already tried to remove some "constant" declarations in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/668913d976. Would it be a problem to (just) remove them from the three declarations I mentioned in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5415? ('my constant %mapping' in lib/L10N/NL.rakumod and the two 'my constant %xlation' in lib/RakuAST/Deparse/L10N/IT.rakumod and 

[09:50] <bartolin> lib/RakuAST/Deparse/L10N/NL.rakumod)

[09:51] <lizmat> no problem at all

[09:53] <bartolin> that should fix the problem from what I've seen.

[09:56] <bartolin> I wonder if there is a potential for an optimization similar to what nine++ did back in 2018 for arrays (776ff354c3 and some follow up commits).

[10:08] <nine> Continuing on http://irclogs.raku.org/raku-dev/2023-09-16.html#07:34-0001 every node should know whether it will trigger compile time code execution. Rather than sprinkling this knowledge through the grammar and actions (which doesn't help synthetic ASTs) those nodes could override IMPL-CHECK.

[10:09] <nine> There we can replace the resolver and thus take note of where the outer edge of the compilation unit will be.
