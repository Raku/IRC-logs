[16:14] <ugexe> patrickb: it looks like https://rakubrew.org/macos_arm/rakubrew isn't working

[16:16] <patrickb> I'm not entirely sure, but I thought there was no such thing (yet) as rakubrew on arm macos

[16:16] <ugexe> https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/commit/465c9335094ec140c357bd4a4521dea1d40be8e2

[16:18] <ugexe> i've been using it on a m2 and a m1 ever since that commit. although i did notice that install-on-macos.sh installs the x86 rakubrew (so I would have manually installed the arm64 rakubrew linked in that commit)

[16:20] <patrickb> actually I think the idea was that the x86 rakubrew is used on arm. but it is ment to install arm rakudo.

[16:21] <patrickb> since it worked there wasn't much incentive to get native arm rakubrew working

[16:22] <ugexe> file ~/.rakubrew/bin/rakubrew

[16:22] <ugexe> /Users/nlogan/.rakubrew/bin/rakubrew: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64

[16:24] <ugexe> on my m1 i can't get it to install an arm64 rakudo, it keeps using x86. on my m2 it does install arm64 rakudo. the difference between these two systems seems to be one has rakubrew itself built for x86 and one for arm64

[16:25] <ugexe> the m2 i manually copied over the arm rakubrew linked in the Changelog above (i.e. macos_arm/rakubrew). the m1 I couldn't install rakubrew that way because that url doesn't exist anymore, but then i can only install a x86 rakubrew

[16:26] <ugexe> though i don't care if the rakubrew is x86 or whatever, indeed i just want it to build arm64 rakudos

[16:29] <ugexe> these instructions also mention macos_arm64 https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/blob/175558e6084a56b9080c34cca9cb08fd4d5d03c0/release-stuff/README.md?plain=1#L39-L40

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there are a lot of weird things in this conversation lol

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for starters: where did that link come from?

[16:36] <ugexe> the changelog linked above, and the source code itself

[16:37] <ugexe> https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/blob/175558e6084a56b9080c34cca9cb08fd4d5d03c0/lib/App/Rakubrew/Update.pm#L31

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, fair enough

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the other one would be: how come the very person who fixed the build for silicon macs "thought there was no such thing as rakubrew on arm macos"?  lol

[16:41] <ugexe> it seems fairly common for that. the ol "who the hell wrote this mess?", looks at the blame, "oh"

[16:43] <ugexe> it seems fairly common for that *to happen in software development*

[16:45] <lizmat> my first case of that I had in the early 80s of being asked to fix a piece of code I had no knowledge of making anymore

[16:46] <lizmat> and it had no other author but me  :-)

[16:51] <Geth> ¦ L10N/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/L10N/commit/79734964c9

[16:54] <MasterDuke> lizmat: would it be easy to put a space before the final '}' of the generated tokens?

[16:55] <lizmat> yes, it would be trivial, but it would add overhead to the future AST it would build

[16:55] <lizmat> m: say Q|/a/|.AST

[16:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar e305eb59f: OUTPUT: «RakuAST::StatementList.new(␤  RakuAST::Statement::Expression.new(␤    expression => RakuAST::QuotedRegex.new(␤      body => RakuAST::Regex::Literal.new("a")␤    )␤  )␤)␤»

[16:56] <lizmat> notice the RakuAST::Regex::WithWhitespace there

[16:56] <lizmat> *wrapper there

[16:56] <patrickb> I am currently on the road. I will have a look at this in the coming days. There is quite a backlog of things I want to fix in rakubrew but right now I am very involved in finally getting cro::http::client to work reliably.

[16:56] <MasterDuke> ah

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> .lizmat how do I upload the advent post

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I have made a markdown of the post

[17:03] <lizmat> can you provide a gist?  I'll take it from there, if you will

[17:04] <lizmat> otherwise, do you have a WordPress login ?

[17:06] <lizmat> .vushu ^^

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Ah no I have not a wordpress login, but I have a repo

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> .lizmat https://github.com/vushu/rakuadvent/tree/main

[17:07] <lizmat> ok, will take it from there  :-)

[19:19] <lizmat> .vushu scheduled for the 19th

[19:24] <lizmat> have tweaked the code examples a bit for readability, and fixed some typos / stylos

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> thanks .lizmat ☺️

[19:40] <lizmat> .vushu I haven't got raylib installed, so I couldn't try out the code

[19:41] <lizmat> but it feels like there are () missing in:

[19:41] <lizmat> our sub $function-name $<parameters>.made $<type>.made

[19:42] <lizmat> our sub $function-name $<parameters>.made() $<type>.made()

[19:42] <lizmat> I mean, the .made methods are supposed to be called at interpolation, no?

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ah yea you are proably right, tbh I haven’t tested code.

[19:54] <lizmat> ok, I will add the ()  :-)

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> thanks again! 😊

[19:57] <lizmat> thank you for making such a cool module!

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ur welcome, I’m happy to contribute to the  Raku ecosystem!

[21:16] <patrickb> ugexe: Just as you said, arm support is in and I completely forgot about it. The reason stuff is broken at the moment is that the website is not at the latest commit but an older one. That's the reason for all the wrongness wrt arm Mac: no binary, broken install-on-macos.sh and wrong documentation on the website. It's simply missing
