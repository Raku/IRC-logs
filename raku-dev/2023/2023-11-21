[02:00] <AlexDaniel> huh, interesting how this just redefined 6.c

[02:00] <AlexDaniel> but I guess that doesn't matter

[02:02] <jdv> how is untodoing todos redefining anything?

[02:03] <jdv> strictly speaking sure, but we backport other changes into the errata test suites...

[02:15] <Geth> Â¦ roast/6.d-errata: It makes more sense with wrong type of value in `is default` for

[02:15] <Geth> Â¦ roast/6.d-errata: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/9f65371afa

[02:35] <AlexDaniel> jdv: it means that older rakudo versions (that officially supported 6.c) no longer pass 6.c-errataâ€¦ I think initially that was not the plan

[02:35] <AlexDaniel> but it doesn't really matter

[02:37] <AlexDaniel> it's fine if they don't pass it because the implementation was clearly wrong (thus errata), but untodoing tests is a different story

[02:41] <jdv> i fail to see how they are "a different story"

[19:41] <jdv> i think the release is done.  anyone know how often rakudo.org updates itself based on gh?

[19:44] <coleman> I don't see a specific cron entry for that under our rakudo.org user, but it may be under root or a different user

[19:44] <coleman> I'll follow up. Is there a script checked into the rakudo repo that should be run?

[19:45] <jdv> i believe its https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/blob/master/update-rakudo.org.sh

[19:46] <jdv> all i know is i uploaded the source release artifacts and updated the git side and its been ~10 and no change yet.

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> coleman: in the meantime, I'm building (a reduced version of) your Caddy based image, hopefully it will work with podman and then it will give plenty of inspiration for the Raku-based version

[19:54] <coleman> Push your changes up to a branch whenever you like, and I will take a look

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I see you hold yourself to higher standards; I have been force pushing my draft PR like crazy ðŸ˜„

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> btw I removed the Mojo module and Plack from the Dockerfile (along with the fetch-recent-blog-posts script) and it still takes eons to get Mowyw installed, I wonder why

[19:59] <coleman> That is okay. It's preferable to force push to a draft PR before merge. The final git history is what should be clean

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Yey, it works like a charm

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the weird thing is that the container doesn't show up with podman container list

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but it most definitely did work when I ran it

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> podman ps --all works though

[20:45] <coleman> jdv: where do the other release artifacts come from

[20:45] <coleman> only 3 here https://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo

[20:45] <coleman> Azure pipelines here? https://dev.azure.com/rakudo/rakudo/_build/results?buildId=5038&view=results

[20:46] <jdv> you mean the nqp*tar* files?

[20:47] <coleman> no, the .msi files, for instance

[20:47] <jdv> other people do that and more - that's who i tell when i'm done

[20:47] <jdv> patrickb and El_Che

[20:48] <jdv> i only handle the source moarvm, nqp, and rakudo releases

[20:48] <coleman> Understood

[21:00] <jdv> patrickb: the release happened except for rakudo.org

[21:01] <jdv> El_Che: ^

[21:01] <jdv> release is "done".  commit away!

[21:02] <coleman> I am reading through the OpenBSD service scripts before I just start running random commands. 

[21:02] <jdv> coleman++

[21:02] <coleman> El_Che, what's your github username, btw?

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "recent blog posts" got CORS blocked, not surprising

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's nxadm https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Other than that, the container with the reworked toolchain seems to work. It's a bit painful that I needed to install build-essentials and libxml2-dev for LibXML but on second thought, I probably haven't even used that, hence the CORS block (I tried to just borrow it from the live site)
