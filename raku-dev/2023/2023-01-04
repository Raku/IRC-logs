[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I got sick towards the end of holidays which mostly killed my motivation and now it's back to work and procrastination...

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but there are things I did check because of how things work (badly) currently

[09:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> smartmatch of s///, m//, tr// kind of stuff, for example

[09:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or typed declarations of &variables

[09:52] <nine> vrurg: in case you're looking for a new task, t/02-rakudo/11-deprecated.t would pass if 'use v6.d;' actually did something in RakuAST

[13:51] <nine> lizmat: out of curiousity: why use so many nqp ops in deparsing code?

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> back to m// - this rather shouldn't be a QuotedRegex node, should it?

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > # A subsbitution, such as `s/abc/def/`, `S/not_in/place/`, or `s/abc/ = 'def'`.

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Oh there is quite some peculiar stuff in here

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for example, I don't think `s/abc/ = 'def'` worked previously

[14:13] <lizmat> nine: it's possibly a premature optimization

[14:13] <lizmat> I was wondering that myself while working on this again, actually, after almost 2 years  :-)

[14:14] *** Kaiepi joined
[14:16] <lizmat> I guess my thinking was that we'd want deparsing to be as fast as possible for debugging purposes

[14:17] <lizmat> also: that work predates the newdisp work, so things have changed since then

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Only deparse for each test once

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Almost all tests were basically deparsing twice: once for the diag,

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: and once to do actual tests on.  Since deparsing could get pretty

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: expensive, doing it only once should help with resource usage during

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: development and CI testing.

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Oddly enough, a few tests failed when using a "canned" deparse.  Not

[14:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: sure yet what caused that, marked those tests as such for later

[14:42] <vrurg> nine: you mean we lack support for `use v6.<rev>;`? I thought it is not a priority.

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way: don't yall think now that we have a rakuast irc channel, we could try to concentrate these discussions there? I would have guessed that was the idea

[14:44] <vrurg> Wrong assumption it seems. :)

[14:45] <nine> I don't see the point of having multiple channels with the same people when only one of them will be active at a time anyway. Current topic of raku development is rakuast

[14:46] <nine> vrurg: we're gonna have to have use v6.<rev> support at some point anyway. I don't see any priorities at all. The whole thing will only be done once all the bits are implemented.

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> nine: on one level, I agree with you; on another level, it's kinda disturbing that any "Raku development" notification can pop up any time, just like any other topic could, but it happens often even

[14:48] <vrurg> "Priority" is too strong word perhaps, but non-passing test is a good reason to do something. I just need to finish up some $dayjob tasks this week in first place.

[14:50] <nine> vrurg: don't we all :)

[14:52] <vrurg> I'm more lucky with this because there are good periods when they totally forget about my existence; and bad periods when they have a couple of new document formats to parse and all has to be done yesterday. :)

[14:53] <lizmat> I guess in the future, #raku-rakuast would be more for users of RakUAST, rather than developers

[14:54] <lizmat> I'm going to keep it around until then

[14:57] <vrurg> BTW, some status, just out of curiosity: my work project lib/ is already 820K, all .rakumod/.rakutest files are ~13800 lines in total. No auto-generated code. Dist 'provides' has 112 modules. 

[14:58] <lizmat> pretty impressive!

[14:59] <vrurg> The only problem in production is memory corruption causing sporadic but regular errors like `no symbol found` in modules using NativeCall. Luckily, it's a cron-launched application, so I just re-process things on the next run.
