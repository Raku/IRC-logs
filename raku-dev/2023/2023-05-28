[01:05] <leont> I wrote my first RakuAST code, converting Path::Finder's glob-to-regex code. I consider it a good sign I was able to do this without asking questions, the second article was helpful in getting me started.

[10:52] <nine> lizmat: I don't have anything per se against .grep / .first on RakuAST nodes. I'm just wary of them in RakuAST core code, as we should traverse the tree as little as possible if we want any hope for the compiler to be reasonably fast.
[10:53] <lizmat> well, this is more intended for RakuAST users, rather than internal uses
[10:53] <lizmat> think rakudoc renderers

[10:55] <lizmat> also: since RakuAST::Node is an Any, .map / .grep / first were already available on nodes, better make them do something sensible / expected
