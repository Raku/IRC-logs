[00:58] <ugexe> what does "SC not yet resolved; lookup failed" mean? It comes from me calling `CompUnit::Repository::Staging.new(...)` 

[01:01] <ugexe> it is probably relevant to mention that it works in some cases. i have a branch of zef that uses it to install things. it is able to install itself fine, but if i try to use that precompiled installed zef to install something else, it gives the error above

[07:38] <hythm> re: "SC not yet resolved; lookup failed" I filed an issue regarding this error sometime ago here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5199  , There is also a workaround at the end of the issue

[07:48] <hythm> re: "Pakku depends on executables so maybe that's not so surprising", Pakku depends on libarchive native dependency. may be Blin doesn't check native deps, or doesn't understand specifying an alternative dependencies  in the form of eg. { any: [dep1, dep2] }, meaning either dep1 or dep2.

[13:14] <jdv> vrurg_: ok.  i'm vague most of the time.

[13:16] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[13:36] <jdv> hmm, moarvm has no changes.  first since i've been doing releases.

[13:37] <jdv> does it make more sense to just cut one to keep the rakudo and moarvm versions in sync or skip it...

[13:49] *** buildable6 left
[13:51] <lizmat> jdv I'd see cut one to prevent confusion

[21:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/ugexe-patch-1: Other distribution objects do not return an opened handle (see `Distribution::Locally`), which was the original intention since the user may want to open the handle with a different encoding or may not be interested in opening the handle at all.
