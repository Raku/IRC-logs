[16:17] <[Coke]> huh. 'nmake spectest' fails on windows CMD prompt with the git clone (but no details on the actual failure output), and if I try 'make spectest' on git bash, I get an error in the Makefile, missing separator.

[16:20] <[Coke]> ... has anyone ever run "make spectest" on windows? this seems very broken.

[16:21] <[Coke]> I think *I* have. wonder if there was a cleanup in the last year or so that broke it on windows.

[16:21] * lizmat stopped doing Windows in 2002

[16:22] <ugexe> ive `nmake spectest` but never `make spectest`

[16:23] <ugexe> in https://github.com/Raku/roast/issues/504 someone mentions using `gmake spectest` as well

[16:23] <[Coke]> part of it has a "cd" in it, which dies as "not a command" under nmake

[16:28] <[Coke]> I was able to do the git clone by hand (failed in nmake), and run the harness by hand (couldn't even get that far because of the cd)

[16:28] <[Coke]> also, 'make test' still failing many nativecall tests when run in || on windows.

[16:33] <vrurg> [Coke]: I did a lot of Makefile refactoring last year, could have broken that part because wasn't able to test accurately. Had to mostly rely on CI.
