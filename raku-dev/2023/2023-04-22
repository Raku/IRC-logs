[19:55] <patrickb> [Coke]: RakudoCIbot is not yet stable, do not expect anything to work. I do progress though. I will make an anouncement once I considder RCB to do something useful.

[19:58] <patrickb> [Coke]: Quick current state of affairs: I think I have finally fixed all bugs that prevented Cro::HTTP::Client to work reliably. That's a big step. I now shifted focus back to RCB itself and work on getting the Open Build Service reliable.
