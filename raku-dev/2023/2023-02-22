[16:21] <bisectable6> Nemokosch, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-09T13:47:38Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> Nemokosch: you might want to re-run the Configure.pl script, maybe do a make realclean first

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-09T15:19:01Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> Nemokosch: much!

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-16T16:03:21Z #raku <rf> Nemokosch: If I have to I will

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-16T19:53:26Z #raku <lizmat> Nemokosch: 20:38:40]  <lizmat>␉thing is: if Nemokosch would be less about themselves and more about the project, they would be a true treasure for the project

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-20T18:30:16Z #raku <cfa> Nemokosch: saying it's not 'decent' strikes me as dismissive but sure, being able to catch regressions early is always good

[16:21] <tellable6> 2023-02-21T17:58:51Z #moarvm <jnthn> Nemokosch: Please see https://jnthn.net/papers/2021-vmil-moarvm-reflections.pdf, especially around slide 80 (although it may not make sense without reading an amount of what comes before it)

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS: CX::Warn::Quietly - do not show warnings, similar to quietly

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS:  CX::Warn::Fatal - immediately throw a warning as an exception

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS:  CX::Warn::Verbose - immediately show warnings with complete backtrace

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS:  CX::Warn::Collect - collect warnings until END, then show with frequencies

[16:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS:  CX::Warn::Debug - show warnings with complete backtrace and debugging info

[16:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-WARNINGS: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/34ad79e2f1

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5210 - was the behavior for multi-letter strings ever properly clarified?

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: my $r = 'aa' ^..^ 'bb'; $r.list.say

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (ab bb) 

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is no 'ba' in this, for example, and looking at the code it's not even surprising

[16:38] <lizmat> m: say 'aa' .. 'bb'

[16:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar a83376c4e: OUTPUT: «"aa".."bb"␤»

[16:38] <lizmat> m: say ('aa' .. 'bb').list

[16:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar a83376c4e: OUTPUT: «(aa ab ba bb)␤»

[16:38] <lizmat> m: say ('aa' ^.. 'bb').list

[16:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar a83376c4e: OUTPUT: «(ab bb)␤»

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this operation simply doesn't have nice algebraic properties, by its (apparent?) definition

[16:42] <lizmat> I'll look into this after the 2023.02 release
