[11:30] <lizmat> I've gathered my thoughts around supporting =table in RakuAST in https://gist.github.com/lizmat/02ac012fe1a32a5a26ba3be31d9d151b

[11:31] <lizmat> comments / suggestions etc welcome

[11:55] <ugexe> will we be able to parse all the pod out of a rakumodule file on install and save it somewhere (preferably precompiled) once that stuff is done?

[11:56] <lizmat> yes

[11:57] <lizmat> several options: serialize the RakuAST tree, with only the RakuAST::Doc objects in it

[11:58] <lizmat> s/serialize/precomp

[11:58] <lizmat> or serialize the RakuAST tree in any other format: markdown / man comes to mind

[11:59] <nine> all of the above :)

[11:59] <lizmat> yup

[12:02] <patrickb> are column headings possible? i.e. the first column is the header, not the first row. (what about first column and row as headers?)

[12:03] <lizmat> column headings are just the way you fill the first column, no?

[12:03] <lizmat> score | 42 | 666

[12:03] <lizmat> age | 18 | 66

[12:04] <patrickb> It's the divider that determines whether something is a header, right?

[12:04] <lizmat> if the first and second row divider do not use the same character, then the first row is a header

[12:04] <lizmat> that's my understanding of it

[12:04] <patrickb> right. is the same possible with the first column?

[12:05] <lizmat> I'm afraid I don't understand, could you gist an example ?

[12:05] <patrickb> will do

[12:11] <nine> In HTML this would be <table> <tr> <th>Primary:</th> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Secondary:</th> <td>2</td> </tr> </table>

[12:15] <lizmat> ok, so you'd need a column to be marked to use <th> instead of <td>

[12:16] <lizmat> I guess we could do this if the first column separator is different from the second

[12:16] <patrickb> I just read up a tiny bit on Pod(https://docs.raku.org/language/tables.html). According to that page column headers are not a thing.

[12:17] <lizmat> indeed, they are not at the moment

[12:17] <patrickb> THen I  guess "Do we want to?" is a good question. "No" is an allowed answer. ;-)

[12:18] <lizmat> well I think we do want to

[12:19] <patrickb> Do we want to be able to deparse a table char identical?

[12:19] <lizmat> I want it to be good enough to roundtrip

[12:19] <lizmat> looks like this:

[12:19] <lizmat>  a | b + c

[12:19] <lizmat>  =========

[12:19] <lizmat>  x | 0 + y

[12:20] <lizmat> is currently valid table pod

[12:20] <patrickb> Cells in the table are always identical width in a given column and identical height in a given row, right?

[12:20] <lizmat> they don't need to be

[12:21] <lizmat> the number of dividers should be the same

[12:21] <patrickb> oooh

[12:21] <patrickb> a | b | c

[12:21] <lizmat>  a | b + c

[12:21] <lizmat>  =========

[12:21] <lizmat>  x | 0     +    y

[12:21] <lizmat> is the same as the above

[12:21] <patrickb> ok

[12:22] <patrickb> but we can' mess with the row height at least?

[12:22] <lizmat> yes, you can, if you use explicit row dividers

[12:22] <patrickb> Wut?

[12:23] <lizmat> yes, the magic world of pod6 tables :-)

[12:23] <lizmat> https://docs.raku.org/language/tables.html#Best_practices   see Heading and single- or multi-line content

[12:24] <patrickb> OK. But not something evelish like:

[12:24] <patrickb> a | b | c

[12:24] <patrickb> a ----- c

[12:24] <patrickb> --| d | c

[12:25] <lizmat> 	a ----- c is not a valid row divider

[12:25] <lizmat> so I guess that would be interpreted as a row with a single column

[12:25] <patrickb> According to that page it is.

[12:26] <lizmat> ?

[12:26] <patrickb> 5. For tables with no header and multi-line content, use one or more contiguous hyphens ('-') as the row separator in the content portion of the table. For example,

[12:28] <lizmat> well, the wording may be confusing there: you cannot have anything else apart from contiguous - and whitespace around it

[12:28] <lizmat> afk for a few mins

[12:28] <patrickb> I get it. So the height of cells in a given row will always be identical.
