[01:36] <MasterDuke> this is odd. in my new RakuAST::Call::Name.PERFORM-CHECK, i call `self.add-worry($resolver.build-exception(...));`. build-exception is getting to right before its final statement (`$type.new(|%opts)`), but `add-worry()` is not being called and then i get a bunch of errors that i'm not explicitly creating ('Use of uninitialized value of type Any in

[01:36] <MasterDuke> numeric context' and 'Use of uninitialized value of type Any in string context. Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.'). then the "Potential difficulties" i did create is printed

[01:39] <MasterDuke> and running under gdb with breakpoints on MVM_panic, MVM_oops, MVM_exception_throw_adhoc, and MVM_exception_throw_adhoc_free never hits!

[02:27] <MasterDuke> hm. so i added `method new { note "in X::Comp::AdHoc.new"; }` in X::Comp::AdHoc and it's getting called, there are none of those 'Use of uninitialized value...' messages, but the "Potential difficulties" is just `True`

[02:38] <MasterDuke> well, if i remove that added new and stick a note in X::Comp.gist, it prints before the 'Use of uninitialized value...' errors. now to try to figure out why...

[03:07] <MasterDuke> well, at least $.filename and $.line are empty

[07:19] <nine> Oh god damn it Github! "Email replies do not support Markdown" but it happily interprets the code as whatever it thinks it means with no way to disable that.

[08:59] <lizmat> timo: use nqp; nqp::setelems(nqp::hash,0)   sadly doesn't work, but I guess could be made to work

[08:59] <lizmat> but generally, in code, resetting a hash is usually done with creating a new nqp::hash

[08:59] <lizmat> *core code

[09:48] <nine> MasterDuke: would help to see the whole code

[16:59] <timo> now i'm not sure if that means you saw what i answered on the "standardize true/false formatting" pull request or not yet

[17:18] <[Coke]> updated that one

[17:23] <timo> and merged

[17:26] <[Coke]> timo++

[17:27] <[Coke]> was pondering an allow-trailing comma option as well
