[02:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ugexe: do you recognize this Github CI error? https://github.com/2colours/WebDriver2/actions/runs/6594557757/job/17918561303

[02:14] <ugexe> is it reproducible if you re-run it? at first look it seems like the extracting failed (even though it extracted fine for previous distributions) in a way that isn't letting zef report the error at all (which seems to happen a lot on windows with github actions)

[02:16] <ugexe> to be clear, what i see happen a lot on github actions with windows are those random exit code 1s. even with one liners that don't use any non-core modules

[02:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, rerunning the two failed tasks with "debug logs"

[02:22] <ugexe> if it is reproducible then it is probably a bug in the most recent release of zef, although those changes should only be exercised after extraction has succeeded

[02:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/2colours/WebDriver2/actions/runs/6594557757/job/17918857009 seems quite non-deterministic

[03:06] <ugexe> two hail marys would be setting RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS to something lowish (to potentially prevent help avoid any weird file access issues that happen in the background like precompilation), and/or setting ZEF_EXTRACT_TIMEOUT=0 (which would avoid a Promise based timer in the extractor, but i dont have much reason to believe that shouldnt work correctly on windows)

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> two notes about the Hungarian translation

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 1. one thing I always cry about with translation is the preposition-oriented phrasing of (eg.) English-first stuff

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's really hard to not "sound like an idiot" if your templates assume that you have prepositions - but in fact you have postpositions

[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> same thing would probably arise with Turkish

[22:31] *** buildable6 left
[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 2. I kinda hope that the translations show how untenable the "negation lifting" is

[22:32] <lizmat> well, that's why there are separate entries for block-if and modifier-if

[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in a lot of languages (I'm inclined to say, in most languages) there isn't a word like English "any"

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so any(1, 2) != 2 turning into none(1, 2) == 2 will really look like a nonsense

[22:33] <lizmat> well..  I see this as a first attempt at localization

[22:33] *** buildable6 joined
[22:34] <lizmat> it won't be ideal in some languages, and maybe even impossible in other

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and I'm deliberately trying to keep the "negativity" down about the mere idea

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> trying to focus on the positives, and in my eyes, ditching "negation lifting" could be a beneficial side effect of this effort

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> having to face how untenable it is once somebody escapes English

[22:35] <lizmat> well, one of the side-effects has already been internal  :-)

[22:35] <lizmat> sleep&

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> nighties

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, is / ist is pretty painful in a language that has zero copula for X is Y type of sentences

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I guess Russian is even worse in this regard
