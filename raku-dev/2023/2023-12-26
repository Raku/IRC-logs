[04:43] <Xliff> Raku-GLib suite timing statistics for Raku 2023.12.1.g.462.a.933.d.21

[04:43] <Xliff> Using the following processor: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K

[04:43] <Xliff> Total number of projects: 34 (466067 loc)

[04:43] <Xliff> Total non-parallel compile times: 6595.450 (193.984 avg)

[04:43] <Xliff> Total parallel compile times: 1157.624 (34.048 avg) 5.697x speedup

[04:43] <Xliff> (Above stats missing GIO)

[04:44] <Xliff> Hmmm... bottom number used to circle around 900 seconds. That's almost a 5 minute increase in parallel compile times.

[04:45] <Xliff> From the previous maching...

[04:45] <Xliff> Raku-GLib suite timing statistics for Raku 2023.12.1.g.462.a.933.d.21

[04:45] <Xliff> Using the following processor: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor

[04:45] <Xliff> Total number of projects: 34 (506509 loc)

[04:45] <Xliff> Total non-parallel compile times: 11871.050 (349.149 avg)

[04:45] <Xliff> Total parallel compile times: 2221.249 (65.331 avg) 5.344x speedup

[04:45] <Xliff> These times are about the same.

[04:53] <Xliff> However reviewing history (which I haven't done in a while) puts the numbers within standard dev, so no worries! =)
