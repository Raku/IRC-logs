[14:50] <ugexe> i wonder if that needs more thought

[14:50] <ugexe> now there is a global RMD output saying "Loaded ..." when I'm pretty sure there is already RMD outputs that say it loaded some module

[14:51] <ugexe> which means there would be two outputs saying they loaded something

[14:51] <ugexe> for example https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/f72c3c019585f00c6bf894d8c5d07367d906c647/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationRepository.rakumod#L114-L127

[14:51] <ugexe> new outputs should take the existing outputs into consideration and not just be considered on their own

[14:53] <ugexe> i guess the message itself is mostly fine since the existing "loaded" lines are referencing repositories, but it still seems a bit confusing

[14:55] <ugexe> like it'd be nice if it was like "Loaded Foo:ver<...> from inst#/foo/bar/baz" instead of what I think would be like "Loaded from inst#/foo/bar/baz" "Loaded Foo:ver<...>"

[14:57] <ugexe> meh i dunno maybe that isn't better
