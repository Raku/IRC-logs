[12:58] <coleman> it's a disk space issue on the dev server causing container pulls to fail (but build/push succeeds). Remediating now.

[14:38] <vrurg> What could cause 'Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp' every time I rebuild updated rakudo? macos on apple silicon.

[14:44] <vrurg> Ok, not every time. Changing a source file and rebuilding fixes the situation...

[14:45] <lizmat> it usually happens if you go back to a previous build

[14:46] <lizmat> I've given up on figuring out why

[14:46] <lizmat> I use https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Repository::Precomp::Cleanup regularly :-)

[14:47] <vrurg> The funniest thing is that rebuilding exactly the same version causes the failure to come back! Oh, no...

[14:48] <lizmat> yeah, build different version, cleanup, build original, and you're ok

[15:04] <vrurg> checksum of v6c.nqp is changing upon every rebuild. This is caused by changing line numbers in #line directives inserted for Raku/ast/* files. Since the sources do not change the checksum used to calculate precompilation signatures doesn't change either. Yet, gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp is chaging.

[15:05] <vrurg> First guess is a hash involved somewhere in the process of producing RakuAST combined source.
