[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Re-commenced work on Formatter class

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: It's been a while, and now RakuAST is available in main, it should

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: be finished.  This commit contains several fixes and improvements

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: done with a better knowledge of grammars and RakuAST.  It also adds

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: a Cool.zprintf method to facilitate testing on the future Str.sprintf

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: method.

[10:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a54b99b600

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: Use the "zprintf" sub / method for testing for now

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: 

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: To make testing the 6.e sprintf functionality based on

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: RakuAST easier.  Please note that these test files are

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: currently *not* part of the spectest.  They will be

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: added in again after they fully pass (with the sprintf

[10:38] <Geth> ¦ roast: name rather than zprintf).

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ roast: First stab at normalizing sprintf tests for 6.e

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ roast: 

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ roast: - only accept a single outcome, not a junction of outcomes

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ roast: - correct all use of g/G losing one position of precision

[11:30] <Geth> ¦ roast: - removed spurious test of Date functionality
