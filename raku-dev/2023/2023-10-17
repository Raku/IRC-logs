[01:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/ugexe-curi-precomp-parallel: Precompile in parallel

[01:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/ugexe-curi-precomp-parallel: 

[01:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/ugexe-curi-precomp-parallel: Previously when installing modules we would precompile them one at a time. This adds some basic parallelization to the precompilation loop so we precompile multiple files at the same time.

[07:30] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: See https://reproducible-builds.org/ for why this is good.

[12:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[12:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: As it is actually not implemented as a pragma, but rather as a very

[12:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: tiny module in lib, and as such should not be localized.

[12:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7660d3692f

[12:22] <jdv> is t/12-rakuast/statement-phaser.rakutest failing for anyone else?

[12:23] <lizmat> it is for me....  without RAkUDO_RAKUAST=1 you mean, right ?

[12:23] <lizmat> jdv will investigate

[12:24] <jdv> yes

[12:24] <jdv> thanks

[17:57] <jdv> blin says Polyglot::Brainfuck's tests are broke

[18:01] * lizmat looks

[18:03] <lizmat> looks like the module is using experimental :rakuast

[18:03] <lizmat> so most likely it will need an update

[18:03] <lizmat> jdv ^^

[18:06] <jdv> cool

[18:09] *** buildable6 left
[18:12] <lizmat> jup, needs correction... will make a PR for it

[18:13] *** buildable6 joined

[18:17] *** buildable6 left

[18:19] <lizmat> jdv: do you have a list?

[18:22] <jdv> just a sec

[18:23] <lizmat> PR for Polyglot::Brainfuck done

[18:25] <jdv> hmm

[18:25] <jdv> i mean all the other "failures" are old news.  i'm not sure if we should look into them or ingore them at this point.

[18:25] <lizmat> that doesn't look alarming ?

[18:26] <jdv> i'm talking about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5429

[18:26] <lizmat> yeah, gotcha

[18:26] <jdv> the ZefFailure and InstallableButUntested bits

[18:26] <jdv> i think they stood out this time to mee cause there's usually way more:)

[18:30] <lizmat> jdv: I am surprised at some missing dependency ones though. eg. Pakku

[18:32] <lizmat> and https://raku.land/zef:vrurg/WWW::GCloud::API::Storage 

[18:33] <lizmat> jdv: but I don't think there's a real blocker atm

[18:34] <jdv> yeah, was just wondering if we could pick some of them off

[18:36] <lizmat> left an issue with vrurg for the WWW::GCloud ones, as they are recent module additions

[18:36] <jdv> timo: around?

[18:36] <jdv> cool

[18:37] <lizmat> hmmm  looks like many of vrurg's modules trigger Blin

[18:37] <lizmat> wonder if they have something in common

[18:37] <lizmat> anyways, need to be afk for a few hours at least

[18:37] <jdv> I didn't vet the MissingDependency list yet

[18:37] <jdv> ok, thanks

[21:57] <vrurg_> jdv: ignore the dependency. It's been fixed on the HEAD, but so far it's the only change and I'm vague about releasing a new version only because of this.

[21:57] <tellable6> 2023-10-17T18:49:20Z #raku <jdv> vrurg looks like WWW::GCloud is misssing a dep on Method::Also

[21:58] <vrurg_> I'd rather wonder what is it about LibXML::Class and Async::Workers??
