[10:33] <patrickb> I'm looking at `my $p = "abc" ~ "d" xx 8000; $page ~~ m/ a (.+) c /;` That consumes ~2gb of memory. The heap snapshot profiler lists top heap size at 47 MB. Does that mean, that the 2GB are definitely non-managed memory?
[10:34] <patrickb>  So is my best bet a traditional profiler and tracing mallocs in moar?
[10:37] <lizmat> think so

[13:54] <MasterDuke> the memory is all being allocated by copy_to, but i'm not yet sure which repr's
[13:58] <MasterDuke> probably MVMString's
[14:02] <MasterDuke> nope, believe it's VMArray's
[14:04] <MasterDuke> i added a print of the number of the source array's elems. at one point it starts copying 64000, then 63996, then 63992, then 63988, ...

[14:44] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Just posted stuff in the issue.
[14:44] <patrickb> Guess it's time to revive the NFA debug logic.
[14:46] <patrickb> The elems getting smaller seems plausible. the backtracking works itself up from the input texts full size.
