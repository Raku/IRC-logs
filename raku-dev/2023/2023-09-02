[14:02] <ab5tract> I've narrowed the issue down to the fact that there is no current package to "enter" into at the time the signature is being built. I've managed to situate things such that the parameter attaches to GLOBAL. In base, it seems to attach into the package that is being created:

[14:03] <ab5tract> m: role R[Int $x where 5] { my Int $x; method m { "magic" }}; dd R[5].new.m

[14:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b26f4a59: OUTPUT: «Potential difficulties:␤    Redeclaration of symbol '$x'.␤    at <tmp>:1␤    ------> role R[Int $x where 5] { my Int $x⏏; method m { "magic" }}; dd R[5].new.m␤"magic"␤»

[14:03] <ab5tract> that behavior feels LTA, to be honest

[14:04] <ab5tract> though I have no idea who's scope you would use in this case

[14:32] <ab5tract> * who else's but the package?

[20:37] <vrurg> ab5tract: what do you mean by "at attaches to GLOBAL"? There is a code block built internally which is the role body. That is where the parameter belongs to.
