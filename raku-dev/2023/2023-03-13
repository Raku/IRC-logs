[00:05] <timo1> but still, any ICE car behind me will barely have passed the intersection when it's already out of sight in my rear view mirror

[00:05] <timo1> it doesn't even feel like the acceleration is so strong

[00:05] <timo1> but there we go

[00:30] <tbrowder__>  can't knock success!

[00:32] <tbrowder__> but those ICEs were not GTOs

[00:36] <tbrowder__> but electric motors have a better acceleration profile i believe. using a clutch will always have some slippage unless the driver is very skilled and has super muscle control. with a motor, i think you can just "pop the clutch" from a stab

[00:36] <tbrowder__> *standing start and it does the hard work for you.

[00:37] <MasterDuke> timo1: what EV do you have?

[00:37] <tbrowder__> none. i had an electric lawn mower one ;-D

[00:37] <tbrowder__> *once

[00:38] <tbrowder__> never had a GTO either, but one of my roomies did

[00:38] <tbrowder__> i do have a pickup that can burn rubber

[00:39] <MasterDuke> well, those usually are rear wheel drive and all the weight (unloaded) is in the front, so burning their rear tires isn't hard

[00:39] <tbrowder__> but that's because the accelerator pedal springs are a little stiff

[00:41] <tbrowder__> true. i had an el camino once and did weight the rear end with sand bags. it helped a little.

[00:41] <tbrowder__> nite folks

[00:42] <tbrowder__> but still wondering about adding "rakudoc" as sub for "pod" in core

[07:35] <nine> Speaking about pod: who will take on implementing pod for RakuAST? My guess is, that it's a medium-large but relatively easy effort.

[07:41] <timo1> it's an opel corsa f

[07:42] <timo1> electric motors have the ability to output the same amount of power at any UPM, is my understanding, so it can get out of a standing start with quite a bit of whoompf

[07:43] <timo1> driving an automatic frees you from having to do the clutch dance yourself and should allow you to get pretty much the same start every time, provided you press the on gas pedal the same amount

[07:56] <nine> But even the automatic can't change the fact that the ICE only produces full torque at narrow rpm range (and it's not at the bottom of the scale). Electric motors are pretty much only limited by the tyres ability to hold on to the road.

[08:09] <timo1> that's true

[08:09] <timo1> but also i'm thinking not everyone is going to push the pedal as far as it will go (without actually burning rubber) when the light switches

[08:10] <timo1> so surely the ICEs, even the not-luxury-sports-car ones, have a lot more acceleration than the drivers are actually making use of

[08:11] <timo1> anyway, i'm a big fan of the fact that EV need no complicated gearbox, it's just a fixed ratio transmission. means there's less bits that can deteriorate over time

[08:13] <timo1> i was always curious to see what exactly happens when you put it in reverse while the car's already at some speed, but the most likely outcomes are 1) the mechanism prevents you from attempting and 2) the gears in the transmission or something else takes damage. one is boring, the other expensive :D

[08:14] <timo1> the internets has videos!

[08:22] <timo1> here's a truck with manual transmission, the guy gets it in reverse with a bit of effort, and from the ghastly sound, the smoke, and the way it sways sideways i think it actually gets the wheels turning backwards while driving forwards?
