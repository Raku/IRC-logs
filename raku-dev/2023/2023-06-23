[11:45] <ugexe> I wonder how there were spectest failures... the CI didn't show any -- https://dev.azure.com/Rakudo/rakudo/_build/results?buildId=4148&view=logs&j=176c5e73-58fc-5e11-dd47-dbb5da07635c&t=5a34e01d-60c7-58a0-5553-da324385256b

[11:46] <lizmat> these were the tests that failed for me: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/46ff9e7bea4829c6d07a5025643c9aa4

[11:47] <lizmat> and which passed after reverting

[11:48] <lizmat> also: after the revert, I've had to nuke my install, because really weird errors related to module loading started occurring

[11:48] <lizmat> so I think it messed up my existing install, maybe something you wouldn't see in a CI test on a fresh install ?

[12:00] *** reportable6 left

[12:03] <ugexe> seems like nqp::radix and nqp::radix_I would have to be returning different values for certain strings

[12:07] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::radix(16,"9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",0,0)

[12:07] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::radix_I(16,"9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",0,0,Int)

[12:09] <ugexe> hmm, well, they both technically match the third element like in the code

[12:10] <ugexe> nqp::atpos(nqp::radix(16,$outstr,0,0),2)

[12:13] <lizmat> I think the radix version silently discards overflow

[12:15] <ugexe> `use nqp; for 0..Inf { my $str = "$_"; die $_ if nqp::radix(16, $str, 0, 0)[2] != nqp::radix_I(16, $str, 0, 0, Int)[2] }` hasn't failed for me yet

[12:15] <lizmat> why [2]?  the value is in [0] ?

[12:15] <ugexe> nqp::atpos(nqp::radix(16,$outstr,0,0),2)

[12:16] <ugexe> is that not [2]?

[12:16] <lizmat> yeah, but:

[12:16] <lizmat> out[0] = converted value

[12:16] <lizmat> out[1] = $number-of-digits-converted

[12:16] <lizmat> out[2] = offset after consuming digits, -1 if no digits consumed

[12:16] <ugexe> if nqp::atpos(nqp::radix(16,$outstr,0,0),2) == 40

[12:16] <ugexe> that is the code in question

[12:16] <lizmat> ah... ok

[12:16] <lizmat> hmmm

[12:17] <lizmat> ok, let me re-revert and check the result

[12:18] <ugexe> or maybe try to figure out which value is causing it with like RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG or wahtever it is

[12:26] <lizmat> hmmm... initial test now ok
