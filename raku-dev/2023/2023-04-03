[10:51] <lizmat> nine: late last night I realized that pod in the legacy grammar doesn't actually produce any QAST by itself
[10:51] <lizmat> any pod is immediately turned into Pod::Block objects and stored to be included in $=pod
[10:52] <lizmat> since we want to allow people to build RakuAST trees *with* pod in them, this will require a different approach in the grammar
[10:53] <lizmat> my main stumbling block atm is to find a way to get a pod block (RakuAST::Doc::Block object) to be added to the current statement list
[11:40] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/04/03/2023-14-fulldist/

[12:17] <ugexe> "...Out of all these, cargo, opam, mix, and zef are the only ones that are mostly working as intended." ðŸ˜¼
[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, do I smell confirmation bias?
[12:38] <ugexe> you really don't waste any time to shit on anyones parade do you lol
[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean yes, it does seem a bit bitter how easy it is to outweigh any criticism with actual evidence and effort, by one sentence that sounds like a praise
[12:44] <ugexe> i guess i can see how one might feel that way if they thought the world revolved around them
[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because this has a lot to do with how somebody immediately clinches to one while only tries to invalidate the other
[12:51] <lizmat> Nemokosch  please, why can't someone be happy to get some validation ?
[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because they dogmatically denied everything that seemed like "invalidation"?

[12:53] <lizmat> Nemokosch  I don't know what your beef is, but please be a bit more....  pleasant ?
[12:54] <lizmat> chill ?
[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I just wish somebody was equally enthusiastic at collecting the praise and reflecting to actual issues
[12:54] <lizmat> it's not a zero sum game
[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or not equally, only comparably
[12:54] <lizmat> it's not a zero sum game
[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure how that matters
[12:55] <lizmat> the fact that someone gets some validation from an unexpected source, doesn't mean you get any less
[12:55] <lizmat> so why rain on someone's parade ?
[12:56] <lizmat> it just portrays you as a bitter person
[12:56] <lizmat> which I'm sure you don't consider yourself to be
[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't envy the "validation". I think - and I have a reason to think - that this "validation" is nonrepresentative, and now it will give more "munition" to neglect the actual issues around CUR and ecosystem stuff.
[13:00] <lizmat> Jeez
[13:00] <lizmat> does the concept of triage mean anything to you ?
[13:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> pretty sure you have already brought it up
[13:01] <lizmat> Apparently you didn't grok the concept: issues around CUR and the ecosystem are triaged to be of lower importance than other issues
[13:02] <lizmat> you can either accept that, or come up with *fixes*, not discussions
[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and that isn't my problem, believe me
[13:02] <lizmat> *sigh*
[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the problem is that ugexe personally tried to downplay this discussions, and literally only did that
[13:03] *** discord-raku-bot was kicked by lizmat (Your behavior is not conducive to the desired environment.))
[13:03] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's as much non-technical and non-management as someone's comment on ycombinator
[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's completely personal
[13:05] <lizmat> Ok: I now have the personal choice to mute the discord-raku-bot, to kick it again, or to ban it from #raku-dev
[13:05] <lizmat> any opinions?

[17:06] <japhb> If anyone here is using a Mac, I would super-appreciate some screenshots of Mac terminal(s) running `terminal-quick-test` from https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Tests (`zef install Terminal::Tests`)
[17:06] <japhb> I'm trying to get a rough idea of how terminal Unicode handling is working cross-platform.
[17:11] <japhb> So far I have gnome-terminal, gnome-terminal + GNU Screen, xterm with various configurations, and Windows Terminal under Windows 10 (though that one's slightly out of date; I've added to the test pattern since then).
[17:12] <japhb> FWIW, Windows Terminal under Windows 10 without enabling UTF-8 support is ... an interesting mess.  Actually pretty decent with UTF-8 turned on properly (why in the world would this be off by default?!?)
[17:37] <[Coke]> readme has a link to https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Tests/blob/main/docs/images/quick-test-windows-terminal-default.png which doesn't exist.

[17:57] <[Coke]> horizontal ruler only appears once in lib/Terminal/Tests/App/QuickTest.rakumod where it's used; no other references anywwhere in the repo.
[17:58] <[Coke]> that code apparently only invoked in the test, running bin/* doesn't trigger it

[18:02] <[Coke]> japhb: "what's a tone bar" (I have no idea what these are supposed to look like)
[18:04] <[Coke]> japhb: https://gist.github.com/coke/9b5d9415d9a65ad08c5b0cf34a839dd4
[18:08] <japhb> [Coke]: You may have an out of date Text::MiscUtils if you're getting the horizontal-ruler missing error
[18:08] <japhb> Yeah, I know about the missing link in the README; I've asked for a replacement from my friend with the Windows 10 box.
[18:11] <japhb> Tone bars are a vertical line with a short bar sticking out to the left at one of five different positions on the vertical line.  I believe they are used for describing tone variations in tonal languages.
[18:11] <japhb> I was going to point them out in the terminal-quick-test output (they're near the center), but apparently that's broken for you.  :-(
[18:11] <japhb> Let me know if upgrading Text::MiscUtils fixes that for you.  :-)
[18:12] <[Coke]> japhb: I *just* installed the deps
[18:12] <[Coke]> removed the horizontal rule call, added screen grab.
[18:13] <[Coke]> recommend adding minimum version check on the dep that you need.

[19:22] <lizmat> nine: I'm seeing some weird shit on HEAD with "make test", could it be that last commit ?
[19:24] <nine> Tests pass fine here
[19:24] <lizmat> hmmmm
[19:24] * lizmat nukes the install dir
[19:31] <lizmat> weird: so I added a method add-leading($doc) to RakuAST::Doc::DeclaratorTarget
[19:31] <lizmat> and wrote a test that does a RakuAST::Sub.add-leading(RakuAST::StrLiteral.new("foo")
[19:32] <lizmat> it fails with: Too few positionals passed; expected 3 arguments but got 2
[19:32] <lizmat> where does that expectation come from?  nine ^^
[19:33] <lizmat> the --ll-exception trace points to the right method
[19:34] <nine> That is weird indeed
[19:42] <lizmat> it's the name that's causing the confusion: if the method is called "zadd-leading", all is ok
[19:45] <lizmat> the only other method called "add-leading" is in RakuAST::Doc::Declarator
[19:46] <lizmat> if I try to call "add-leading" on the RakUAST::Sub, it says "No such method"
[19:52] <lizmat> and now it works like a charm?

[20:25] <ugexe> ironically the only munition I have to neglect anything is Nemokosch's incessant complaining and demeanor
[20:39] *** Nemokosch joined
[21:01] <Nemokosch> just like it has always been ironic to contaminate technical topics with personal distaste for someone, which is the reason this whole argument or whatever, happened
[21:01] <tellable6> 2023-03-30T22:46:30Z #raku <guifa> Nemokosch: yeah, the advantage of a highlighter like the Atom one is it generally will work fairly well on something that's syntantically invalid
[21:01] <tellable6> 2023-03-31T21:46:03Z #raku <lucs> Nemokosch: Fair enough, re. your first comment, and in that case, user docs on its usage seem pretty important.
[21:02] <Nemokosch> the situation has gotten unmaintainable though, that one is for sure
[21:04] <ugexe> i have no idea what you're talking about honestly. i just posted a comment where an outsider said something nice, and you acted like it killed someone close to you. that i cannot find a small piece of joy in something without your negative selfish attitude makes me not very interested in contributing anything
[21:06] <ugexe> i'll be glad to not defend your attitude like last time when this inevitably gets brought up for discussion in a future meeting
[21:08] <Nemokosch> Now I have no idea what you are talking about. What sort of defending are you talking about?
[21:09] <ugexe> you've been brought up at multiple rsc meetings now over your behavior
[21:10] <ugexe> its will inevitably happen again, only this time I will take a difference stance
[21:10] *** coleman joined
[21:11] <Nemokosch> We are living different timelines apparently. There was a meeting where I was present, you were the only one who hasn't even said a word throughout the whole session, even though I literally called you out as one of the people who had sabotaged technical discussions by diversive, personal remarks
[21:12] <Nemokosch> That was your time to be surprised, I'm not holding back information from you
[21:13] <ugexe> I didn't say anything because you decided to personally call me out
[21:14] <ugexe> Nor did I feel the need to defend myself (and it sure didn't seem like anyone else thought so either)
[21:15] <Nemokosch> So you didn't feel the need to defend yourself in a situation where I was alone talking to like 6 people basically questioning me as part of the procedure
[21:16] <ugexe> Nemokosch I'm choosing to not interact with you anymore, please do not try to interact with me
[21:16] <Nemokosch> And now you are threatening me, making implications about things that I wouldn't know about
[21:18] <Nemokosch> I can't (and shouldn't) force anybody to interact with me, that's perfectly fair
[21:29] <Nemokosch> I sincerely don't think any people must be good friends in order to work towards certain goals, and I can't even understand this phenomenon that a lot of people rather bite their other hand if that means they can act upon their distaste for somebody else; that somebody regards this interpersonal tension so high that they rather hurt the common goal
