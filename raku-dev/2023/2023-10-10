[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: add localization support for "is" traits

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - allow e.g. "is VEROUDERD" as Dutch xlation of "is DEPRECATED"

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add the necessary items in the translation template files

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - translate the Dutch version where possible

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - handle deparsing of "is" traits

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add creation of "trait-is2ast" method in RakuAST::L10N

[08:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make sure there's a default "trait-is2ast" lookup in the grammar

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make sure ::Trait::Is creation handles localization

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Only if there can only be one argument to an RakuAST::class.new,

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: should it be a single positional.  However, all of the ::Postcircumfix

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: classes will need to have a :colonpairs argument added to allow

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: in-place creation of these classes *with* adverbs.  So change the

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: interface of this class now, to not hide it later when the :colonpairs

[10:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: logic gets added.

[15:53] <[Tux]> I enjoyed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUEzH1SR9A8&list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFwrDiojWd_lFUaOHlsUUEJa&index=23

[15:57] * [Coke] adds that to his queue, thanks.

[16:21] <ab5tract_> well, I've almost got `FIRST` working with a return value, but something is add a `QAST::WVal.new(Nil)` as the last statement in the `FIRST` block QAST :(

[16:21] <ab5tract_> can't seem to find a culprit

[16:21] <ab5tract_> *adding

[16:24] <nine> That's done when the block is sunk

[16:24] <ab5tract_> I was just imagining that might be the case

[16:25] <ab5tract_> how can I prevent that?

[16:30] <ab5tract_> I mean, I don't understand the mechanism that is causing it to sink. What I'm trying to implement is `unless $t { $t = { #FIRST block }() }`and as far as I can tell the synthetic AST is correct. I guess the code is sunk when originally defined, because it is the only statement on the line? 

[16:32] <ab5tract_> gar, stop yer stinkin' sinkin'!

[16:32] <nine> Look at src/Raku/ast/sink.rakumod

[16:34] <ab5tract_> ok, so let me be evil >:)

[16:43] <ab5tract_> I wonder whether it makes sense to add an `unsink` method to `Sinkable`, or just to leave it to ad-hoc brutalist attribute manipulation as I have done now

[16:51] <ab5tract_> let's keep some encapsulation

[17:14] <nine> Surely there is a way to come up with the right answer from the start? Sink calculation should happen quite late when we already have all the information
