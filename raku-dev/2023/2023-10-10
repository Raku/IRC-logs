[15:53] <[Tux]> I enjoyed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUEzH1SR9A8&list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFwrDiojWd_lFUaOHlsUUEJa&index=23
[15:57] * [Coke] adds that to his queue, thanks.
[16:21] <ab5tract_> well, I've almost got `FIRST` working with a return value, but something is add a `QAST::WVal.new(Nil)` as the last statement in the `FIRST` block QAST :(
[16:21] <ab5tract_> can't seem to find a culprit
[16:21] <ab5tract_> *adding
[16:24] <nine> That's done when the block is sunk
[16:24] <ab5tract_> I was just imagining that might be the case
[16:25] <ab5tract_> how can I prevent that?
[16:30] <ab5tract_> I mean, I don't understand the mechanism that is causing it to sink. What I'm trying to implement is `unless $t { $t = { #FIRST block }() }`and as far as I can tell the synthetic AST is correct. I guess the code is sunk when originally defined, because it is the only statement on the line? 
[16:32] <ab5tract_> gar, stop yer stinkin' sinkin'!
[16:32] <nine> Look at src/Raku/ast/sink.rakumod
[16:34] <ab5tract_> ok, so let me be evil >:)
[16:43] <ab5tract_> I wonder whether it makes sense to add an `unsink` method to `Sinkable`, or just to leave it to ad-hoc brutalist attribute manipulation as I have done now
[16:51] <ab5tract_> let's keep some encapsulation
[17:14] <nine> Surely there is a way to come up with the right answer from the start? Sink calculation should happen quite late when we already have all the information
