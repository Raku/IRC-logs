[00:57] <hythm> I remember seeing this issue when installing `Whateverable`. downgrading `IRC::Client` fixed the issue for me
[00:58] <hythm> jdv, Can you confirm the `IRC::Client` version installed on the boxes that successfully installed Whateverable?

[18:37] <AlexDaniel> Some of the bots are back up! 🤗 I'm still working on the glibc issue so the other bots will be brought up a bit later.
[18:37] <AlexDaniel> weekly:
[18:37] <notable6> AlexDaniel, No notes for “weekly”

[18:39] <AlexDaniel> 😇 I actually want to move everything from the old server asap, so it'd be nice if it went faster
[18:39] <AlexDaniel> I also noticed that sometimes they rejoin like this… but then they're stable
[18:41] <AlexDaniel> the only remaining issue right now is that the old server had a newer glibc, but for the new setup I'm using an older rakudo-star image that cannot work with builds that were done with newer glibc!
[18:41] <AlexDaniel> for now the plan is to just rebuild everything in the last year or two
[18:42] <AlexDaniel> and to do that I actually need the build process to be dockerized somehow… I'll do it on the weekend
[18:43] <[Coke]> off
[18:43] <[Coke]> oof I mean
[18:44] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: it's not a problem, the bots actually work fine even if lots of builds are missing, it's just that it'll take like one week or so to get bisect to be precise to a single commit in that range
[18:44] <AlexDaniel> right now the issue is that the build is missing even for the latest commit :D
[18:45] <[Coke]> Is now a good time to ask if I can contribute builds for a completely different OS? :)
[18:45] <[Coke]> (I doubt it is. :)
[18:46] <AlexDaniel> and the good news is that I'll probably allow private messages for all the bots. Of course, the new setup is not 100% secure, but it's a lot safer than the old one actually.
[18:46] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I think it's already supported?
[18:46] <AlexDaniel> it depends on what you want to do with them
[18:48] <AlexDaniel> like, shareable allows these links: https://whateverable.6lang.org/HEAD?arch=linux-x86_64&type=moarvm
[18:48] <AlexDaniel> (ok this is currently down but it'll be back up soon)
[18:49] <AlexDaniel> so technically you can have any architecture there, I think. but how are you going to use it? The bots won't be able to run snippets on windows, for example. Unless you host your bots on windows that is
[18:50] <AlexDaniel> and by setting things up in config.json you can actually have your own storage for the builds if you host your own bots

[20:00] <[Coke]> ok, so step 1, host own bots. I have no idea if we can run m2 in the cloud yet, but glad to see the current infra theoretically supports it. Thanks for all the work you've put in here, AD.
