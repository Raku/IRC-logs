[00:47] <[Coke]> Yes, the docs should list all the exceptions a routine can throw.

[01:16] <ugexe> m: my @x := 1 if 0; |@x

[01:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a5e0181e: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller prefix:<|>(VMNull); none of these signatures matches:␤    (\x --> Slip:D)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:17] <ugexe> hmm i think there is a more general issue somewhere about binding conditionally like that

[01:33] <ugexe> m: say class Foo {}.new.cache

[01:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a5e0181e: OUTPUT: «(Foo.new)␤»

[01:34] <ugexe> unfortunate
