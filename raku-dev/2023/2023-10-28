[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> bisectable: say 'almafa' ~~ Real()

[12:39] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[12:39] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Output on all releases: https://gist.github.com/a7aa31495c1678a1e48088be462f3403

[12:39] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Bisecting by output (old=2020.10 new=2020.11) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[12:39] <bisectable6> nemokosch, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/92a4627dee8e861cf065e415e987eb81

[12:39] <bisectable6> nemokosch, (2020-11-15) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f2d73287f95ad6fa9eba8856ad15f3e8f9076d6e

[12:40] <bisectable6> nemokosch, ⚠ New output detected, please review the results manually

[12:40] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Output on all releases and bisected commits: https://gist.github.com/5c3b564d95fa7170f7f805109d298b7a

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> idk if there is an issue for this but it's a rather ugly regression

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> bisectable: say grammar { token TOP { <print>+ } }.parse: "foo";

[12:43] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[12:44] <bisectable6> nemokosch, Output on all releases: https://gist.github.com/623fe08f019f0f1595d665c4db8a54f0

[12:44] <bisectable6> nemokosch, More than 3 changes to bisect, please try a narrower range like old=2023.09 new=HEAD

[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> seems like this never worked

[13:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ping https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5377
