[15:06] <tellable6> 2023-02-21T23:59:50Z #raku-dev <jdv> AlexDaniel releaseable6's status function seems borked.  moving on without it for now.
[15:06] <AlexDaniel> did you just break all documentation links :'(
[15:06] <AlexDaniel> https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations
[15:06] <AlexDaniel> that's what google gave me, fwiw
[15:06] <AlexDaniel> I did not come up with that link myself
[15:07] <AlexDaniel> I did not come up with that link myself
[15:07] <AlexDaniel> should be fixable with some rewrite rules, and arguably the version without html is better too.
