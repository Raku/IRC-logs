[13:01] <jdv> gonna do the release now

[13:02] <jdv> changelogs look simple - should be up in a bit

[13:02] <lizmat> will be afk for a few hours, trusting you'll do a good job  

[13:03] <lizmat> on the changelogs

[13:03] <lizmat> and the rest  :-)

[13:03] <jdv> ok, have fun

[13:40] <ab5tract> ok... failing test cases that pass when tested directly against the interpreter (not in REPL, either)

[13:42] <ab5tract> that's the kind of torment I do not enjoy

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh yeah, that made me stop with the sigil declaration constraint fixup ðŸ˜…

[13:47] <ab5tract> i wonder what could be causing it..

[13:47] <ab5tract> precomp?

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would also be thinking of something like that... the failing version is probably "more compile-time" in some sense

[14:45] <jdv> what are the current spec test counts for rakuast?

[14:45] <jdv> or how do i run it to get them?

[16:14] <ab5tract> jdv: make spectest with RAKUDO_RAKUAST set to 1 in your environment

[16:16] <jdv> yeah, my numbers don't line up for test and spectest so i just used what liz said in the last weekly

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> does something like raku -M'Slang::Roman:ver<0.2>' not work? (mind the :ver part)

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> > Could not find Slang::Roman:ver<0.2> in:

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if I paste exactly the same thing into the REPL, it can find it no problem (except the REPL can't tweak the grammar so that use will be useless)

[16:48] <[Coke]> looks like no. Guessing we did an initial simple implementation but didn't include modifiers.

[16:48] <[Coke]> Seems worth opening a ticket for

[16:48] <[Coke]> but also you have a workaround that isn't much more chars.

[16:49] <[Coke]> (putting in a use in the -e)

[17:12] <ugexe> -M doesn't work with any adverbs

[17:13] <ugexe> probably because there is nothing yet for parsing a dependency spec string

[17:13] <ugexe> since whatever is fed to -M probably doesn't go through the grammar/actions etc that would typically parse that 

[17:13] <ugexe> there isn't any technically reason it shouldn't be made to work though

[17:14] <ugexe> s/technically/technical/

[17:21] <[Coke]> +1
