[14:11] <lizmat> nine: do you have any idea why, in the BUILDPLAN, the values 1501..1510 aren't 801..810 ?
[14:12] <lizmat> (and yes, I've started on the BUILDALL building logic
[14:12] <lizmat> )
[14:19] <nine> lizmat: no
[14:20] <lizmat> ok, maybe something to change after RakuAST becomes default
[14:20] <nine> Why not just keep it?
[14:21] <lizmat> slight optimization in handling BUILDALL building
[14:43] <vrurg_> lizmat: just for you to know, this would break AttrX::Mooish as it is using BUILDPLAN to let have lazily initialized :D attributes. Apparently, I wouldn't complain as I rely on undocumented guts. :)
[14:43] <lizmat> hehe... indeed  :-)
[14:44] <vrurg_> But we don't have legal way on doing this, so...
[14:44] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg
[14:59] <nine> We have renumbered BUILDPLAN once already
[15:02] <vrurg> And that made me add a check on Rakudo version to maintain backward compatibility. Would need one more check if renumbering happens again.

[16:33] <jdv> can someone bump the things?  looks like moarvm has newer commits than nqp points at.
[16:34] <lizmat> but not many?
[16:36] <jdv> no, not many
[16:36] <lizmat> 2 basically, a helper script and an extra build option?
[16:36] <jdv> looks like it
[16:36] <lizmat> so you want it bumped anyways ?
[16:37] <jdv> is there a reason not to?
[16:38] <jdv> be weird for releases if they didn't match up, no?
[16:39] <lizmat> they would be done in the release, I'd say
[16:39] <lizmat> but will bump now
[16:39] <jdv> thanks

[16:43] <[Coke]> better to bump *before* the release as a canary, no?
[16:43] <[Coke]> if we only bump at time of release, we're getting very little testing on those last few items.
[16:44] <[Coke]> we could be more selective we kept 'main' and 'next-release' as separate branches.
