[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wrote at #raku-steering-council for the lack of a better option known to me - apparently the only people who "showed interest" were some sort of alt-right trolls

[09:30] <lizmat> FWIW, I have no idea where your comment was deleted, what it was about or who deleted it

[09:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I posted a screenshot on # raku-steering-council, couldn't find the original one but it was highly similar. Maybe those who can delete it can see what got deleted anyway? I don't know

[09:35] <lizmat> the screen shots don't make clear which issue this is about ?

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that was the comment that got deleted right away, Github fortunately doesn't retroactively remove comments without a full site load

[09:37] <lizmat> what is the URL of the issue ?

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/304

[09:41] <lizmat> ok, I can see who did the deletion

[09:43] <lizmat> left a comment

[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> do I feel attacked when I get silently blocked from a discussion that I'm somewhat involved in, when I actually make the point that the "solo creator" shouldn't be drained by vague objections to the architecture? frankly, I do

[09:49] *** |Tux| left
[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the irony is that not for the first time, these objections are raised by people who I don't think have actually tried to use the system so I think there would be some merit in saying "I have tried to use it and it seems workable"...

[12:26] <[Coke]> just had a failure installing Text::CSV on 2023.09.

[12:26] <tellable6> 2023-10-01T20:40:54Z #raku-dev <finanalyst> [Coke] would you have another look at the new search PR for doc-website. Maybe a conf call to discuss whats needed to complete?

[12:27] <[Coke]> zef version 0.19.1

[12:39] <ugexe> what error?

[12:41] <ugexe> hmmm, i can't even install zef on 2023.09 using rakubrew

[12:43] <ugexe> raku -e 'say CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.repository-for-name("site").can-install()'

[12:43] <ugexe> False

[12:44] <ugexe> Does that one-liner return True for anyone with a 2023.09 built from scratch (not upgraded from a previous version)?

[12:44] <AlexDaniel> mmm yes

[12:45] <tellable6> hey AlexDaniel, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/40dde62cff9c842dc73331e3486bb49b

[12:45] <AlexDaniel> I get True on 2023.09

[12:45] <AlexDaniel> installed with rakubrew

[12:45] <AlexDaniel> pretty sure I wiped everything before installing it

[12:46] <ugexe> i see, thanks. im just gonna nuke it and try again i suppose, because nothing changed in the release to have caused that

[12:50] <ugexe> [Coke]: Text::CSV fails its test for me as well

[12:50] <ugexe> (nuking 2023.09 and rebuilding it fixed my other problem apparently)

[12:57] <ugexe> [Coke]: lizmat: I think the files/ directory of Text::CSV may not have gotten packaged when it was uploaded to fez

[12:57] <ugexe> which the tests use

[12:57] <lizmat> [Tux] ^^

[12:59] <ugexe> i dunno if/how to get fez to include arbitrary directories, but moving files/ to i.e. t/files would work

[13:47] <[Coke]> the Text::CSV is a blocker for me for $dayjob. I just tried to update everything so I can re-run my data collection, and am blocked - will have to downgrade something (maybe I can install a slightly older Text::CSV)

[13:53] <[Coke]> :ver<0.014> installed

[14:10] <ugexe> you could just --/test

[14:10] <ugexe> it is only failing because the .tar.gz doesn't include a csv file the tests expect to exist

[14:16] <[Coke]> I always feel weird about that, but yah

[15:39] * |Tux| just executed what I was instructed to do. So I move files to t/files, up the version and push and fe upload?

[15:39] <|Tux|> fez

[16:21] <[Coke]> Try to install it locally before pushing, I guess?

[16:25] <ugexe> you'd have to update any references to the file in there as well

[16:25] <ugexe> which i assume is just one

[22:12] <ugexe> `if: runner.os != 'Windows'` is the more idiomatic way to do that fwiw

[22:17] <ugexe> i guess if you want to do a command conditionally in a single step though that wouldn't work

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know. Apparently if on steps is relatively recent overall

[22:27] <ugexe> I've been talking to tony about trying to release the next major version of zef (zef 3 - don't ask about 1 or 2) around the time of the next rakudo release. We are planning on breaking backwards compatibility where it makes sense regardless of the ecosystem consequences. The current iteration of zef would continue to live, and would be updated/used to nag people off doing things that will be

[22:27] <ugexe> broken in zef 3. Eventually some critical mass of of distributions would work with zef 3, at which point it could be probably be merged into the main branch and become the new zef.

[22:27] <ugexe> next raku release rather

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That may as well be great news, depending on what it will affect exactly üòõ

[22:36] <ugexe> anything that seems wrong is probably on the table. my goal will mostly be continue the design goal of workflows being parallizable and how that information gets displayed to the user, as well as security considerations

[22:37] *** finanalyst left
[22:37] <ugexe> Build.pm? gone or changed. Module name queries? gone. installing to multiple repos in a single command (lol) gone

[22:37] <ugexe> thats a few of the things

[22:40] <vrurg_> What will replace Build.pm?

[22:41] <ugexe> there is Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON for instance, but I'll probably write a builder module for doing what Build.pm does (probably just run it even). The main problem there being Build.pm isnt listed in META6.json so there is no way to know if a build step needs to occur without extracting the distribution

[22:42] <ugexe> (so users would just add like "builder":"Distribution::Builder::DeprecatedBuilder" to meta6.json, or we inject that key in the ecosystem automatically temprialrly)

[22:44] <vrurg_> I like it!

[22:44] <lizmat> MasterDuke: .literalize

[23:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> sounds reasonable

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> circling back to github actions: isn't there something like premade actions? I think most of Raku repos that are really just distributions in the ecosystem could mostly use the same action file

[23:10] <ugexe> users should probably be using Raku/setup-raku@v1 with zef install .

[23:10] <ugexe> just running tests isn't really sufficient

[23:12] <ugexe> installing it ensures it, well, installs. notably that all the modules it provides can actually compile, which the tests may not exercise for a given module

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's also a fair point but where I'm coming from is like two steps behind from that

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> namely that currently there are dozens of various kind of wrong workflows all around

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> even having the same one wrong workflow would be a step forward, which could then become the one right workflow

[23:17] <ugexe> yeah ci is famous for cargo culted content

[23:24] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/8d80f80e295555b336d90bc295768476

[23:24] <ugexe> this is what i'd use if i was adding a github action to a basic distribution

[23:25] <ugexe> i created a distribution in the early days to teach people how to do a basic travis-ci config - https://github.com/ugexe/P6TCI - maybe someone should create one for github actions

[23:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> do you not think this workflow would be affected by the mysterious TAP error on Windows?

[23:29] <ugexe> If tap::harness is installed by default in those actions (I'm not sure that they are) then i'd add --/tap-harness regardless of which OS

[23:30] <ugexe> if its not installed then just don't install it

[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, definitely worth a try

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, this is good. Thanks

[23:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It would make sense to replace a bunch of broken CI's but it's way too much night for me to start with that

[23:39] <ugexe> the only issue that might happen is if it has a dependency that it might go over the windows long path name limit. any distribution without any dependencies (like Benchmark) wouldnt have that problem

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd say getting an error visibly because of that isn't so bad still

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> better than getting an error because of a faulty workflow or a nonreproducible error somewhere in the toolchain

[23:41] <ugexe> the error won't give you any indication of what the problem is though

[23:41] <ugexe> so that part is annoying

[23:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> doesn't it produce some logs?

[23:44] <ugexe> it'll say it can't find some module during testing, which will be due to a precompilation file not getting created or being readable due to path length

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ehh
