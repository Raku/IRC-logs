[14:35] <ab5tract_> Is there an existing pattern for de-duplicating exceptions that get thrown twice with the same parameters for the same exceptions in a single compilation cycle?

[21:50] <nine_> lizmat: feels to me like this ^^^ is a syntactic detail that should not be present in the AST. After all the A stands for abstract. Trying to retain the source information makes the AST more complicated than needed. I think instead, deparse should use a reasonable heuristic to create nice looking code in a standard format regardless of what the input was.

[21:54] *** buildable6 left
[21:55] *** buildable6 joined
[21:57] <lizmat> nine_: I've tried to do that, but it just basically becomes a nightmare with many special cases

[21:58] <lizmat> it's like you're parsing the tree all over again

[21:58] <lizmat> that's why I added the attribute: if you're building trees manually, you can simply ignore it

[21:59] <lizmat> and it will deparse safely with parentheses

[21:59] <lizmat> in the grammar it's very clear whether its a say("foo") or a say "foo"

[21:59] <lizmat> so it just needs to set the attribute in one location

[22:00] <lizmat> and yes, I understand the A in AST

[22:04] <nine_> Why not just always produce the parentheses then? Seems like a safe choice.

[22:05] <lizmat> that's what it did before...

[22:05] <lizmat> and it bothered me to no end  that `say "foo"` became `say("foo")`

[22:06] <lizmat> and since we're going to use deparsing for changing of localization, it felt better that a change in localization would not change that

[22:07] <lizmat> m: say Q|say "foo"|.AST.DEPARSE("NL")

[22:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 50b8e191a: OUTPUT: «zeg "foo"␤␤»

[22:07] <lizmat> rather than `zeg("foo")`

[22:13] <nine_> But where do you draw the line then?

[22:13] *** Altai-man left

[22:14] <lizmat> nine_: I plan to draw the line after adding a deparsing hint to QuotedRegex

[22:14] <lizmat> and that's it, as far as I can see right now

[22:15] <lizmat> either that, or creating different (dummy) processors that would deparse differently

[22:16] <lizmat> but *that* really feels yucky to me

[22:18] <lizmat> nine: alternately, I could create a subclass RakuAST::Call::Name::WithoutParentheses of RakuAST::Call::Name and just add different deparsing for that ?

[22:18] <lizmat> nine_: would that feel better for you?

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> oh, whateverable actually doesn't have any moarvm builds because I wiped them to save space

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> interesting

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> I don't remember myself doing that, but apparently I did!

[22:52] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: 

[22:52] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: The idea is that if any other mechanism breaks (e.g. webhooks are down),

[22:52] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: then you should be able to “wake” it up by just asking for the status.

[22:52] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: However, in this case the functionality was a bit too eager, which

[22:52] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: resulted in the bot always saying “Building” even when it was idle.
