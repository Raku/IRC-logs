[12:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This allows one to write normalized unicode strings. It should be noted

[12:58] <[Coke]> for the deparse, is there a goal to have non-english slangs (maybe not slangs) where keywords are in another language?

[12:59] <[Coke]> (just looking at the ::NL commit)

[12:59] <lizmat> yes, that's the idea proposed by finanalyst and agreed upon at the RCS

[13:00] <lizmat> [Coke]: and also the grammar should be slangifiable in the same manner as well

[13:01] <lizmat> this should allow teaching Raku / programming in general using Raku in people's native language
