[14:32] <[Coke]> jdv: which of the three repos is that for?
[14:32] <[Coke]> Or is that the bot itself?
[14:34] <jdv> its just for the bot for rakudo
[14:35] <jdv> not new(s)
[14:40] <[Coke]> üñí
[14:41] <[Coke]> (ok, that emoji over windows terminal to a tmux session was weird.)
[14:41] <jdv> i see a question mark
[14:53] <[Coke]> üëç
[14:53] <[Coke]> There's the non-reversed one
[14:54] <jdv> ok
[14:54] <[Coke]> :)
[14:54] <jdv> https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-dev/2023-02-27.html#15:13
[14:54] <jdv> is that what you're looking for?
[15:02] <[Coke]> you had already answered the question, but nifty, thanks!
[15:04] <[Tux]> OS update in progress. I hope it won't have impact on the timings. (openSUSE Leap 15.3 ‚Üí 15.4)

[15:50] <[Coke]> the former

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in what sense is it reversed?
[16:14] <[Coke]> color
[16:14] <jdv> the box is centos5 so a bit behind the times:(
[16:14] <[Coke]> (at least, in my font)
[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> üëç
[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this one is yellow for me, the other one is just alpha with a contour
