[12:01] <patrickb> I've Bern thinking about having SSL in core a lot some time ago. My conclusion was that there is not much point as long as installing it via zef is simple and doesn't require a compiler on Windows. Adding some SSL module to our precompiled packages is worth a thought, but I'd really like to keep those packages slim. People should be encouraged to use zef.

[12:01] <patrickb> *been

[12:25] <ugexe> it would help zef though in that it could use pure raku code for fetching modules

[12:53] <ab5tract_> interesting point

[12:56] <ugexe> the more practical application is for users to adjust socket examples 

[12:57] *** buildable6 left
[12:57] <ugexe> like an example might be careful to show a site that can serve http

[12:58] <ugexe> but if a new users just adjusts the url to point at a site that only does https, then it obviously isn't going to work and they've have to figure out why

[12:59] <[Coke]> I'm +1 for that being out of the box or having an amazing error message.

[12:59] <[Coke]> (like we do with REPL where we recommend specific modules that you probably want0

[13:00] *** buildable6 joined

[14:49] <nine> m: my $a; sub foo { say $a }; BEGIN $a = 1; $a = 2; foo;

[14:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 33a6bccf8: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[14:49] <nine> That's as expected. However:

[14:49] <nine> m: my $a; sub foo { say $a }; BEGIN $a = 1; BEGIN foo; $a = 2; foo;

[14:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 33a6bccf8: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§1‚ê§¬ª

[14:49] <nine> Funny how easy it is to find problems with the old compiler when pondering the replacement.

[14:51] <nine> Continuing on https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-dev/2023-10-22.html#11:42 as demonstrated above, even if we post-process the QAST for BEGIN time execution, this QAST must only be used for actual BEGIN time execution. Problem is that we set the result of the compilation of this QAST as $!do for the code object, so the same QAST will be used even for non-BEGIN time execution.

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would really like to think there is no reason to run on something from 2014...

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> there's also no reason not to be able to do it :)

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> it's just a bit of tech excellence in whateverable itself. Storing all commits up to 2014 in such a limited amount of space.
