[13:07] <patrickb> jdv or whomever: My gpg key expired a week ago. My backing master key is not in my reach for another week, so I won't be able to generate new keys.

[13:08] <patrickb> This in turn means I won't be able to usefully sign the binary release files until 31.12.

[13:09] <patrickb> jdv: You do have a working key and are listed as a releaser on https://rakudo.org/downloads/verifying

[13:09] <patrickb> jdv: Could you sign the release files on rakudo.org?

[13:17] <patrickb> jdv: I use the following small script to generate the signatures: https://paste.sr.ht/~patrickb/a39d0360debfbdc66981f9263de808898f4cf542

[13:24] <patrickb> jdv: Just realized that you already know how those signature and checksum files are created. The source archives have the same files accompanying them.

[13:24] <patrickb> I just removed the wrong signings I uploaded to rakudo.org. Thus the binary files are not signed for now. Sorry guys!
