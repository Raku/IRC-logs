[09:18] <ab5tract_> Is there a reason we RakuAST::Node doesn’t implement a build-exception method that takes a resolver and the normal arguments for build-expression but then mixes in line and file information to the (known-to-be `X::Comp`) exceptions?

[09:45] <ab5tract_> lizmat: intriguing

[09:57] <ab5tract_> Regarding styling entering the AST domain, for the sake of sanity and limited resources I think the cheapest approach to making deparse DWIM for the user should be taken. That looks like sub-classes to me.

[09:57] <ab5tract_> afk &

[10:25] <AlexDaniel> OK, fixed the issue with buildable rejoining. I think it's related to MoarVM switch from master to main

[10:31] *** tellable6 left
[10:31] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: most of the time they operate just fine. But sometimes they get into this cycle of waiting for a short ping and then reconnecting because they're not getting it, and it repeats…

[10:32] *** tellable6 joined
[10:32] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: and, I also noticed, that for example they do this sometimes ↑

[10:32] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: notice how tellable connected, then closed the connection because of pings, then reconnected again. Usually 1 reconnect is enough.

[10:32] <lizmat> hmmm   looks like the scheduling of a next ping is not disabling the previous checkl

[11:20] <nine_> lizmat: when one is creating a synthetic AST, how does one know whether to use a Call::Name or Call::Name::WithoutParentheses?

[11:20] *** bisectable6 left
[11:20] *** bisectable6 joined
[11:21] <lizmat> when you're creating synthetic ASTs, you probably not interested in deparsing anyway, so Call::Name

[11:21] <nine_> But how does one know that?

[11:22] *** buildable6 left
[11:22] *** buildable6 joined
[11:23] <lizmat> from documentation?

[11:24] <nine_> What would the docs say here?

[11:24] *** bisectable6 left
[11:25] *** bisectable6 joined
[11:25] <lizmat> to use Call::Name to call a subroutine by name, and mention the subclass as an alternative if one wants to influence deparsing

[11:26] <lizmat> which you probably won't want to do, as synthetically built ASTs could well not deparse validly anyway

[11:38] <lizmat> and maybe we could declare Call::Name::WithoutParentheses an implementation detail

[19:55] <Geth> ¦ WebService-GitHub/main: Also HTTP::Tiny is currently better maintained and a better fit as this

[22:01] <patrickb> Just wondering: Why do those show up here? Do all raku-community-modules commits show up?

[22:02] <patrickb> Feels misplaced for #raku-dev in my eyes.

[23:37] <lizmat> if community modules should be announced, where should they be?

[23:37] <lizmat> maybe a separate channel?   or not being announced at all?
