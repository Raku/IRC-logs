[10:33] <lizmat> jdv: tweaked the ChangeLog

[10:33] <lizmat> I wonder whether we should lump all of the RakuAST commits together in a single item  "RakuAST development"

[10:38] <nine> Yeah, I don't think the details are going to matter for any reader.

[10:55] <lizmat> so done

[10:55] <lizmat> we went from 694 to 787

[12:59] <jdv> so much for earlier:)

[13:00] <jdv> so if we could refrain from commiting for a bit that would be nice

[13:00] <jdv> lizmat: thanks

[13:25] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: you asked about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1745 and i think i need to review ugexe's comments there and on irc. iirc there was likely some change needed in the PR, but that wouldn't be fully sufficient without the rakudo changes he also mentioned

[13:25] *** jonasjlinde joined
[13:48] <[Coke]> ok. It's a blocker for me at $dayjob; can't even 'zef install' some things as a result.

[13:48] <[Coke]> So if you want to do a first pass, we can figure out what the plan is. Would love to get it fixed in the release after the immediate one.

[13:48] <[Coke]> I can help with the rakudo bits, probably.

[13:50] * [Coke] writes a raku program to send to his kids about some recreational math in a doctor who episode that was just on in the house a few days ago, and may have temporarily maxed out his nerd setting.

[13:53] <MasterDuke> i should have some time in the next couple days

[13:57] <[Coke]> I owe you a beer, thank you.

[17:45] <MasterDuke> nice, jdv++

[17:45] <[Coke]> also: do we need nqp to do anything special with long paths, or is it OK to just have that in rakudo?

[18:24] <nine> This ^^^ is horrible. It requires the compiler to check, whether the symbol we're declaring has already been used in the same scope before the declaration. We don't have any infrastructure at all to do this. Everything is geared towards symbol access resolving a symbol to the declaration, not the other way round.

[18:25] <nine> It's going to be a lot of effort with no easy solution and it will most likely fix just a single spectest (test, not file) :/

[20:31] <MasterDuke> huh, i wonder why locally i don't get the errors seen in all the CI jobs for https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1745

[20:40] <MasterDuke> even under valgrind it's fine

[21:06] <MasterDuke> oh, i can repro it when building moarvm with --no-mimalloc
