[16:58] <jdv> lizmat: thanks!

[17:12] <Xliff> Does Perl5 do rotor?

[17:13] <lizmat> not when I was still doing Perl, but that's 10+ years ago

[17:16] <Xliff> List::MoreUtils looks to cover it...

[17:17] <Xliff> Although the function name is a little cheeky: "natatime" (rolls eyes)

[17:17] <lizmat> that's not rotor, that's batch

[17:17] <lizmat> ?

[17:17] <Xliff> There's also "slideatatime"

[17:24] <lizmat> that was added after I ported https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/List::MoreUtils to Raku, so after April 2018

[17:29] <jdv> how is it cheeky?  its at least self desribing.  rotor id have to look up.

[17:29] <lizmat> at least they should have called it slide-at-a-time  :-)

[17:29] <lizmat> ah no, they can't  :-)

[19:46] <lizmat> jdv ^^   does that help?

[19:47] <lizmat> just moving it was not enough

[19:47] <lizmat> in any case, the issue was in the test

[19:48] <jdv> huh, i'm getting "Could not find Test::Util in..."

[19:48] <jdv> i don't run roast tests individually a lot:(

[19:50] <lizmat> is clean for me now

[19:52] <jdv> yup, thanks!

[19:53] <jdv> for some reason i thought the make way broken and i was trying to use fudgeandrun:(

[19:53] <jdv> s/way/way was/

[19:54] <lizmat> it was for a while, I think

[20:11] <lizmat> jdv about to go afk

[20:12] <lizmat> unless you need me for something stat  :-)

[20:12] <jdv> stress-errata is failing too - only if you changed that stuff

[20:13] <lizmat> any file?

[20:14] <jdv> t/spec/S03-operators/context.t on d it looks like

[20:14] <lizmat> on d?

[20:15] <jdv> and c

[20:15] <jdv> i mean on the errata branches

[20:16] <jdv> 6.c-errata and 6.d-errata but master passes

[20:17] <lizmat> yeah, that's a change I made

[20:17] <lizmat> so should the errata branches be adapted then?

[20:17] <jdv> if its obvious i can do it

[20:17] <jdv> just cherry pick or somethiung

[20:18] <lizmat> I'd say: change the "throws-like" in line 92 to dies-ok

[20:18] <jdv> thanks

[20:18] <lizmat> ok, going afk now&
