[10:17] <ab5tract> Anyone know the specifics of why we don’t have `longdouble` as a native type?

[10:20] *** sena_kun joined
[10:23] <lizmat> is that the same as a num64 ?

[10:24] <lizmat> or an int128 ?

[12:08] <tbrowder__> ref bad published modules (mea culpa): how about some kind of repo like fez/zef, where an author with an account can publish bad modules ids (name, auth, ver). then, normal zef operation would ignore any module listed there. raku.land would do the same. options for both could enable full search if need be.

[12:10] <lizmat> this is basically one of the things "supersedes" was intended to be doing

[12:10] <lizmat> and producing a list for that was shot down  :-(

[12:10] <lizmat> afk&

[12:10] <tbrowder__> we could call the repo something like "NOTAMs" (from the aviation world) "notice to all module users"

[12:13] <tbrowder__> the problem with supersedes to me is it would take more processing than just a database sql like my thought

[12:15] <tbrowder__> one table with all modules, one table with bad modules, exclude the bad

[12:17] <tbrowder__> using postgres it should be a breeze for our db experts

[13:24] <ugexe> if anyone can modify an index for an item/distribution they don't actually own then we are just going back to p6c type insecure namespacing

[13:26] <ugexe> it is probably ok for something like raku.land to use a list like that, but module installers shouldn't

[13:27] <ugexe> that being said, if i ran raku.land i still wouldn't use it

[13:29] <ugexe> raku.land probably needs to figure out a way to have user accounts, and a way for those user accounts to prove they own a specific zef:foo username (a naive way would be uploading a do-nothing distribution with some token that raku.land could fetch and check for), and then have a control panel that allows user to e.g. hide their own distributions on raku.land only

[13:31] <ugexe> note that such a process would not allow hiding the distribution from a module installer resolving that namespace though

[13:37] <El_Che> hi

[13:58] <tbrowder__> i’m talking about some way the owner could be proven via fez, and he would be the only person who could add it to the do-not-use list

[15:15] *** El_Che left
[15:43] <japhb> ab5tract: long double isn't a portable size, and it might expose some assumptions we have as well -- it would be equivalent to either num80 or num128, for architectures that support it at all, but obviously num80 isn't power-of-two sized, some architectures don't support anything bigger than num64, and it can be rather surprisingly slow when you can't output actual native code for it.

[15:51] <japhb> None of that would *prevent* us from supporting the size, but it certainly reduced the push to do so.

[19:16] <AntonOks> Hi. I've copied over the new 2023.11 Rakudo Star release files to "rakudo.org".

[19:16] <AntonOks> I also logged in there and ran "update-rakudo.org.sh".

[19:16] <tellable6> 2023-11-16T17:17:19Z #raku <andinus> AntonOks: should be fixed now

[19:16] <AntonOks> Still the new release and files are not shown.

[19:16] <AntonOks> Can someone look into "rakudo.org" and check why the website is not showing updated releases anymore?
