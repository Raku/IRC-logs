[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: Make multi subs check for re-declaration of signatures

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This addresses the oldest existing unsolved ticket in the old issue tracker:

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Catch duplicate signatures in a multi sub at compile time, as they will

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: inevitably fail at run-time.

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: Support where blocks on variables

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Previously the grammar was confused by the existence of where blocks

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: in variable declarations.

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Now they are fully supported.

[11:27] <lizmat> meh  looks like we lost t/spec/S05-grammar/example.t

[11:31] <tbrowder__> i have it if you really lost it

[11:31] <lizmat> :-)

[11:38] <tbrowder__> i see the rakudo.org dowloads are repopulating. will the 2023.10 linux gcc ones be restored soon? i can provide backups on my servers if it would help the cause in the future

[12:17] <ab5tract> lizmat: I didn’t see any shifts at all when running tests locally

[12:39] <tbrowder__> hm, github/rakudo need big sign for how to help with RakudoAST. perhaps a RakudoAST.md file with a guide to start. i know lizmat has blogged about. (it may be there and i have missed it)

[12:41] <lizmat> tbrowder__ https://dev.to/lizmat/series/23109

[12:41] <lizmat> ab5tract: did you update roast ?

[12:47] <tbrowder__> any objection to a PR to create such a page?

[12:49] <lizmat> tbrowder__: no, by all means, go ahead!

[13:12] <ab5tract> tbrowder__: there are a few RakuAST related docs in the source tree that you might want to consolidate or otherwise interact with

[13:41] <tbrowder__> wilco

[13:59] <tbrowder__> dang!, 1st i should learn real name: RakuAST

[14:43] <ab5tract> :)

[16:45] <ugexe> i wonder how this test was ever passing on windows

[16:45] <ugexe> on windows you can't close a file handle that is open

[16:45] <ugexe> er, you cant delete a file that is open

[17:56] <tbrowder__> on another topic, i want to try inputting my advent article into (ugh) the wordpress editor in Mardown format. however Pod:To::Markdown *deliberately* only converts rakudoc tables into html--bummer! first question is "why?"

[18:01] <tbrowder__> i took a first bite at a PR on the existing commented-out sub table2markdown and found more errors than i could deal with in a hurry, so i wrote a quickie raku prog to just replace the constant html table  with the constant markdown table.

[18:01] <tbrowder__> *Markdown

[18:03] <tbrowder__>  that works for now.

[18:04] <tbrowder__> but i filed an issue

[18:05] <tbrowder__> maybe a good exercise for RakuAST

[22:03] <tbrowder__> ab5tract: are all 40 "rakuast-tests" supposed to pass? with or without env var RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1?

[22:05] <ab5tract> I think there is some fudging in a few places, so you might need to run some with the test harness (make t/spec/foo.t)

[22:06] <ab5tract> But yeah, they should all pass with make tests

[22:06] <ab5tract> *test

[22:12] *** sena_kun left
[22:44] <tbrowder__> ok, thnx

[23:34] <lizmat> actually, the localization tests *fail* with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 when run under "make test"

[23:35] <lizmat> that's because under RakuAST, currently slangs do *not* get activated when invoked from a file that is not pre-compiled yet

[23:57] <tbrowder__> well, i have other problems now. current main branch fails to compile (no RAKUDO_RAKUAST  env var defined). msg about existskey and npq, exact msg in a bit...
