[18:40] <lizmat> thought I'd keep it at this for now

[18:49] <leont> Doesn't harness6 need the same extension change?

[18:49] <lizmat> hmmm.. I assumed it already had that...

[18:50] <lizmat> ok, found it

[18:51] <lizmat> how do you force running harness6 again ?

[18:51] <lizmat> from "make test" ?

[19:01] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b5df6e28c4

[19:02] <lizmat> the .rakutest extension is one of the Raku specific file extensions to be used for test files

[19:02] <lizmat> it allows for places like Github to know that there's Raku inside, rather than e.g. Perl

[19:03] <lizmat> utilities such as App::Mi6 create test files with that extensions
