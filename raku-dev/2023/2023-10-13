[04:00] <[Coke]> nemokosch - yes. I have a lot of stuff going on and am not going to make this my full time job.

[04:07] <[Coke]> And, truth be told, I feel like even answer that question has drained me of more tuits.

[04:07] <[Coke]> :answering

[09:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean makes sense but I think if anybody really wanted to take over Niecza and revive it, the reasons for not doing it have been pretty similar...

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The reason it faded away in the first place was probably pretty similar

[12:51] <jdv> iirc one of the reasons Niecza faded is because the design painted iyself into a corner

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's quite possible

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, I don't just think that creating a runtime and/or compiler for Raku is an overwhelming effort (which it sure is)

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but also that there is no proper specification to implement and relatedly, no code currently written is guaranteed in any meaningful way to work with an implementation passing the roast tests
