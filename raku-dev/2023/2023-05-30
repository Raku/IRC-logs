[12:59] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This will facilitate deparsing a lot and will probably allow

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Before this, some single statement blockoids were deparsed on a

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: single line.  While this is nice for tests, in actual usage this

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: turns out to create really long lines in some cases.  Instead of

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: trying to fix that, give up on that thought for now: only empty

[13:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: blockoids will be deparsed on the same line (think: class A { })

[13:27] <[Tux]> Raku won't build:

[13:27] <[Tux]> linux.c:(.text+0x3f40): multiple definition of `uv__io_fork'; 3rdparty/libuv/libuv.a(linux-core.o):linux-core.c:(.text+0x610): first defined here

[13:27] <[Tux]> is just one of the messages

[13:30] <lizmat> [Tux]: is that a fresh checkout ?

[13:30] <lizmat> if not, maybe you can try that ?

[13:31] <lizmat> suspecting the libuv update somehow causing this

[13:31] <lizmat> fwiw, all builds fine for me

[13:31] <[Tux]> I think my process refreshes all git repos before it starts

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - introduce RakuAST::StatementPrefix::Phaser::Block base class

[13:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   that need an exit handler
