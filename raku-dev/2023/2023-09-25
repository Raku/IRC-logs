[06:40] <nine> ab5tract: I could easily setup wireguard to get into my home network. I just have never really needed that. ssh has always been enough. But recently I upgraded my Wifi router to latest openWRT and I guess I forgot to enable even that.

[06:41] <nine> m: say Q|for ^10 { }; 1|.AST.statements.head.sunk

[06:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 92485d66c: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[06:41] <nine> lizmat: ^^^

[06:41] <nine> The last statement of an EVALed comp unit is not sunk. Otherwise you'd never get the produced value

[06:42] <nine> Ah, now I read that you noticed that already :)

[07:19] <[Tux]> Asked to up the version of Text::CSV. Inc in META6.json is the only thing to be done? And should that also require "6.d" (instead of 6.c)?

[07:24] <lizmat> [Tux]: yes, META6.json is enough, unless you also specify versions in the "class" statement

[07:24] <lizmat> 6.d would be a safe bet by now

[07:28] <[Tux]> done

[07:29] <lizmat> did you do the release already?   I'm hoping on updating Slang::Tuxic later today

[07:29] <lizmat> making it ready for the RakuAST world

[07:31] <lizmat> ah well, I'll be in the next release :-)

[07:43] <lizmat> *it'll

[07:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> why does Text::CSV still live in p6c?

[07:58] <lizmat> I guess someone needs to tell [Tux] how to migrate to the zef ecosystem  :-)

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> fez upload 🧠

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, I haven't said this in a while, maybe it's for the better... but I actually think the condition of CompUnit stuff AND also the ecosystem architecture is kind of a blocker for Raku adoption

[08:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and unlike improving the runtime, this probably doesn't require technical wonders, "only" some willingness to let go

[08:06] <Geth> ¦ Slang-Tuxic/main: review: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Slang-Tuxic/commit/c585abc714

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/language/compilation#Why_change? there is this page and it's somewhat reassuring that by now I anticipated all of these points

[08:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It's just not enough justification for the price imposed on everybody, namely that the filesystem based resolution is useless for production purposes.

[08:09] <[Tux]> lizmat, you *do* have commit. Just go ahead :)

[08:09] <lizmat> True that... but I don't have Tux credentials on the zef ecosystem  :-)

[08:15] <[Tux]> Ah, so what does that Tux person need to do?

[08:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if there is no zef:Tux then maybe get fez first and do fez register

[08:22] <lizmat> https://deathbyperl6.com/faq-zef-ecosystem/

[08:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> is this also a fresh release?

[08:26] <lizmat> nemokosch you mean Slang::Tuxic ?

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yep

[08:33] <lizmat> yeah, that will be a fresh release, with RakuAST support

[08:36] <[Tux]> fez register finished

[08:37] <lizmat> [Tux] ok, will do the rest to the Text::CSV module once I'm done with Slang::Tuxic, ok ?

[08:38] <lizmat> your login name be "tux" I assume ?

[08:38] <lizmat> so auth<zef:tux> ?

[08:38] <[Tux]> or Tux. Don't know if it is case-sensitive. Thanks!

[08:38] <[Tux]> >>= Username: Tux

[08:38] <lizmat> it is case sensitive afaik

[08:39] <lizmat> ok, so Tux it is then

[09:00] <lizmat> the RakuAST support is still incomplete, and may actually need some Raku grammar tweaks, otherwise it was ready for release

[10:24] <|Tux|> regarding the META change: is there *anything* I need to do other than up the version in META on upcoming changes?

[10:28] <lizmat> well, unless you introduce new dependencies ?

[10:32] <|Tux|> so, change, inc version, push, done. ?

[10:35] <|Tux|> and do I switch from `zef` to `fez`? My time routine now invokes stuff like `zef update`, `zef install --exclude=perl Slang::Tuxic` and `zef upgrade --exclude=perl Slang::Tuxic`

[10:40] <lizmat> that remains the same, fez is only for uploading dists

[10:40] <lizmat> it's like the CLI for PAUSE

[10:41] <lizmat> like zef is the cpan CLI

[10:41] <lizmat> (at least, last time I looked at the cpan CLI about 10 years ago :-)

[10:43] * |Tux| never used the CPAN CLI

[10:44] <lizmat> personally, I use App::Mi6, which wraps fez

[13:34] <lizmat> Slang::Tuxic now works with RakuAST

[13:50] <vrurg> .ask Xliff In your GLib it looks like using something like `submethod BUILD (:$hash-table, :$!type) { $!h = $hash-table }` is a common pattern. Why not safer `submethod TWEAK(:hash-table($!h), :$!type) {}`?
