[11:38] <lizmat> I wonder how we should fix this for RakuAST:

[11:38] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Process.rakumod#L69-L73

[11:38] <lizmat> it doesn't look like fixed, so maybe the reason for some precomp issues with RakuAST

[12:03] <ab5tract> lizmat: maybe a good idea to file it as an issue so that it doesn't get lost?

[12:03] <ab5tract> the `ff` problem, I mean

[12:03] <lizmat> yeah, probably should  :-)

[12:06] <ab5tract> I'm going to move on from the remaining once issue. I think the real fix is like I mentioned before, we need to propagate p6stateinit for the compunit. I don't know how they manage to attach the declaration properly in the old frontend

[12:07] <lizmat> understood... there's plenty of other, bigger fish to fry

[14:20] <lizmat> Question of the day: what does this display?

[14:20] <lizmat> class A { has @.a = 1,2,3; method b() { "$.a" } }; dd A.new.b

[14:20] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 4b69dd51e: OUTPUT: «"1 2 3"␤»

[14:20] <lizmat> evalable6  you spoilsport

[14:20] <lizmat> TIL

[14:23] <ugexe> that is what i expected, but i'm not the right person to ask :P

[14:24] <ugexe> $. is like self.

[14:24] <lizmat> m: class A { has @.a = 1,2,3; method b() { "@.a" } }; dd A.new.b

[14:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ed482e0f: OUTPUT: «"\@.a"␤»

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, $.foobar is actually $(self.foobar)...

[14:25] <ugexe> i also expect that lol

[14:25] <ugexe> m: my @a = 1,2,3; say "@a"

[14:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ed482e0f: OUTPUT: «@a␤»

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> : class A { has @.a = 1,2,3; method b() { "@.a()" } }; dd A.new.b

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oops

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: class A { has @.a = 1,2,3; method b() { "@.a()" } }; dd A.new.b

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  "\@.a()" 

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, now this is kinda bizarre

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: my @demo = <a b c>; say "@demo.join()"

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  abc 

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that should have interpolated by all reasonings available

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> didn't we collect some issue of similar spirit with Rob Ransbottom?

[14:31] <ugexe> m: my @a = 1,2,3; say "@a"; say "@a<>"; # this is unexpected to me though

[14:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ed482e0f: OUTPUT: «@a␤1 2 3␤»

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5249 not the same thing but on the same topic

[14:32] *** ab5tract joined
[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @.a() doesn't interpolate even if a is a usual method

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> moreover, it's still an error in RakuAST land, it tries to do (@.a)()

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> again, even if a happens to be a method
