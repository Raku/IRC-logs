[13:29] <ugexe> oh i didn't realize we did stuff like allow `unlink(@multiple-files` which A) isnt immediately clear what happens when one of the files fails to unlink, as well as it returns an array(!)

[13:31] <ugexe> also seems odd that it doesn't return Array[IO::Path], but instead Array[IO::Path|Str]

[13:32] <ugexe> its been like this since forever though

[13:34] <ugexe> m: say unlink("asdfasfasdf")

[13:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar c1f7e4d48: OUTPUT: «[asdfasfasdf]␤»

[13:35] <ugexe> eh, that isn't useful

[13:35] <ugexe> it should fail, return false, return empty, anything but return the file it definitely did not delete

[21:50] <lizmat> I'm getting *really* confused now  :-)

[21:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7bc98ec41: OUTPUT: «<-1/0>␤»

[21:51] <lizmat> m: dd Rat.new(-1,0).Num    # -Inf with legacy, Inf with RakuAST

[21:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7bc98ec41: OUTPUT: «-Inf␤»

[21:53] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::div_In(-1,0)   # ok under legacy *and* RakuAST

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7bc98ec41: OUTPUT: «-Inf␤»

[21:54] <lizmat> I've adapted Rational.Num to show the values of $!numerator and $!denominator are correct  and they are

[21:54] <lizmat> yet, in that case nqp::div_In(-1,0) returns Inf rather than -Inf under RakuAST

[21:55] <lizmat> fixing this is +2 on the number of passing test files for RakuAST

[21:58] <lizmat> nine ^^ ideas ?  I'm out apart from adapting Rational.Num to check specifically for $!denominator == 0 and then do "manual" checking rather than calling nqp::div_In
