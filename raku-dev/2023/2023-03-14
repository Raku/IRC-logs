[10:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cacc3e3920

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be good to know what was on purpose and what was just a limitation of the compiler that nobody caught

[10:04] <lizmat> in the new grammar, you could do it and it would generate the right initializer code

[10:04] <lizmat> except that it wouldn't bind, but still just assigj

[10:04] <lizmat> *assign

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, that might be confusing

[10:05] <lizmat> fwiw, I would prefer the := hint as an alternative to "is built(:bind)"

[10:16] <lizmat> but yeah, allowing it with confusing semantics, would not be a good thing, so it is specifically prohibited at the moment

[14:14] <[Coke]> lizmat: I hope for your sake you have some automated tooling to help you gather these bits.

[14:15] <lizmat> some, not a lot: once we got rid of p6c, the module gathering can be made mostly automatic

[17:50] <bduggan> Hi everyone -- any feedback on the above PR would be great...also, is it expected that a number of the integration tests might fail for unrelated reasons?

[17:58] <lizmat> bduggan: just gave some feedback, looks cool to me

[17:59] <lizmat> if you're running the tests with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1, then yes, some tests are still expected to fail atm

[18:00] <lizmat> 133/145 (make test) and 743/1355 (make spectest) are the number of completely passing tests files atm
