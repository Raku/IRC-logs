[10:27] <lizmat> idea for future RakuAST optimization
[10:28] <lizmat> annotate any routine with a marker that if it is just returning any of the input parameters unchanged
[10:29] <lizmat> so that new-disp will be able to just replace it with that parameter *without* needing to call anything
[10:29] <lizmat> think methods returning self  (such as Str.Str)
[10:30] <lizmat> or hook methods such xsyn returning the second positional (aka 3rd arg) by default
[10:31] <lizmat> also think allowing --> self as syntax
[10:36] <lizmat> and the routine is otherwise empty

[12:06] <nine> lizmat: how many such identity functions are there? How would we communicate this from the AST to the dispatcher? Anyway, spesh should be doing a pretty good job at inlining such functions and optimizing away all the overhead.
[12:07] <lizmat> I would guess a hint in the QAST ?    doesn't the current static optimizer already look at some hints?   timo1 ?
[12:08] <lizmat> well, if a dispatcher could already do it, why leave it to spesh?
[12:09] <nine> QAST can carry annotations, but the dispatcher only has byte code and meta objects to work with
[12:10] <lizmat> then in the meta object?
[12:10] <lizmat> Sub.always-returns?
[12:10] <lizmat> Routine.always-returns?
[12:23] <nine> Actually I meant MVMCode objects
[12:23] <nine> Low level is low :)

[20:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5285
[20:10] <patrickb> I have now fixed all issues that prevented the precompiled binaries on rakudo.org (and via `rakubrew download`) to be built.
[20:11] <patrickb> AFAIK it's less than two weeks until 2023.06 is scheduled for release. Should we just skip the binaries for 2023.05 or should we do a point release?
[20:15] <patrickb> jdv: Is it intentional that the next release date in docs/release_guide.pod is a Monday and not a Saturday?
[20:25] <patrickb> lizmat: Bumping moar will get the Windows tests working again. Can you do the honors?
[20:25] <japhb> I'd vote for the point release, if nothing else just to ensure everything works as expected now.
[20:52] <lizmat> patrickb: am unsure what you want me to do
[20:53] <lizmat> nothing changed with Moar since June 4th ?
