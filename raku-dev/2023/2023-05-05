[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: eedc165f44 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | 6 files

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: several fixes and preparations

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - indentation is determined by the last seen =doc statement, *not*

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   by the initial =begin

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - keep opener / closer with RakuAST::Doc::Markup object, for (de)parsing

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - adjust stringification of ::Markup accordingly

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - don't create RakuAST::Doc::Paragraph objects for a simple string

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - various fixes with LegacyPodification, e.g. support for V<> and

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   not rendering a bare newline at the end

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/eedc165f44

[17:23] <lizmat> still 803

[17:28] <lizmat> m: dd $=pod[0].contents[0].contents[0]␤=foo B< <bar> >

[17:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1ca18f17: OUTPUT: «FormattingCode @!contents = Pod::FormattingCode.new(type => "B", meta => [], config => {}, contents => ["<bar> "])␤»

[17:29] <lizmat> that's expected, apart from having the leading whitespace having been trimmed

[17:29] <lizmat> m: dd $=pod[0].contents[0].contents[0]␤=foo B« «bar» »

[17:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1ca18f17: OUTPUT: «FormattingCode @!contents = Pod::FormattingCode.new(type => "B", meta => [], config => {}, contents => ["«bar"])␤»

[17:30] <lizmat> so why is the » not part of the markup?    It was when using <bar> ?

[17:30] <lizmat> m: dd $=pod[0].contents[0].contents[0]␤=foo B< «bar» >

[17:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1ca18f17: OUTPUT: «FormattingCode @!contents = Pod::FormattingCode.new(type => "B", meta => [], config => {}, contents => ["«bar» "])␤»

[17:31] <lizmat> and here it's back again

[18:06] <[Coke]> misparse, i guess

[18:30] <[Coke]> grammar's pod_formatting_code Has some confusing logic for guillemet versus angle bracket

[18:32] <lizmat> yeah, not going to look at that

[18:33] <lizmat> I've taken a more reverse engineering approach to this

[18:33] *** ab5tract joined
[18:49] <[Coke]> Ah, just going to do it write in the AST and not worry about this?

[18:50] <[Coke]> +1 if so

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: c10767e533 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | 2 files

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: fix fallback resolver looking in wrong scopes

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: We need to preserve the state of the resolver where the code object

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: actually sits in the tree, not when dynamic compilation is called.

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c10767e533

[19:24] <nine> And yet more workarounds for dynamic compilation. Wonder if they will be enough or if we will be forced to re-think a lot of this at some point.
