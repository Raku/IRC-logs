[14:18] <ugexe> in perl 5.38 you can use //= in subroutine signatures, something you can't do in raku

[14:19] <lizmat> yeah, that's definitely something I would like to see  :-)

[14:19] <lizmat> m: sub a($a //= 42) { dd }; a

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a4be8de5: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed parameter␤at <tmp>:1␤------> sub a($a⏏ //= 42) { dd }; a␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[14:19] <lizmat> should be safe to add looks like

[14:23] <vrurg> What's the difference with using a default value?

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I suppose that you can still pass in the value and have it ignored

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if it's undefined

[14:24] <vrurg> OK, makes sense.

[14:24] <lizmat> it would require changes to the binder though...   brrrr

[14:25] <vrurg> This was my first thought. :)

[14:26] <patrickb> jdv: Release builds are done.

[14:28] <vrurg> Thinking of the legacy parser, it wouldn't be that hard, perhaps, to add to the binder itself. But what I'm afraid of is changing the binder in BOOTSTRAP.

[15:47] <ugexe> (also ||= 0)

[15:47] <ugexe> er ||=

[17:40] <gfldex> m: sub foo(Any:D $a = 42) { } # this is a clear statment. This sub can not deal with undefined values.

[17:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a4be8de5: ( no output )

[17:41] <gfldex> I'm not sure I like //= in Signatures and I do like a fancy syntax or two. It may shift the burden of using undefined values to the wrong person.

[17:42] <gfldex> But then, the API person can choose to hide //= inside the subs body, so the API user person can't see that.

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I found myself wanting to be able to pass in a placeholder, iirc eventually the function handled it internally

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The situation was a bit worse because a :@variable doesn't have good ways to indicate optionalness

[20:56] <[Coke]> nine: any suggestions on https://github.com/krunen/term-termios/issues/20 appreciated. Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON is invoking make and failing bug I can't see why

[20:56] <[Coke]> *but

[21:02] <[Coke]> opened a linked issue in DBMFJ

[21:20] <ugexe> you should probably post the output of `zef build . --debug` to that issue too

[21:20] <ugexe> well i guess its probably the same for the various updates they made

[21:23] * ugexe tries

[21:48] <[Coke]> ugexe: it's in there.

[22:14] <ugexe> raku -e '$*IN.close; say so shell("ls", :!err, :!out)'

[22:14] <ugexe> that shows false on macOS

[22:14] <ugexe> if you remove the $*IN.close it shows true

[22:15] <ugexe> it shows true on linux regardless of $*IN.close

[22:19] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5357

[22:22] <ugexe> appears to have been this way since at least 2021

[22:23] <ugexe> i don't think i can builder anything older
