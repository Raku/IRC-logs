[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: properly handle C< <+> >
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: In other words, you may use the same opener inside markup, as long
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: as it's balanced.  This is achieved by making <+> a dummy Markup
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: object (without letter), that flattens out in legacy podification.
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[16:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This also adds support for « » openers/closers

[16:18] <lizmat> 806!
[16:26] <lizmat> nine: any idea why --doc CLI argument is ignored with RakuAST?
[16:27] <lizmat> ah, it looks like my $doc := %*COMPILING<%?OPTIONS><doc>; is not checked in Raku/Actions
[16:28] <lizmat> will take that on as the next thing, it's needed for t/spec/S26-documentation/02-paragraph.t
