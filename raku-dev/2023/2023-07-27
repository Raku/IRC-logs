[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Fix stringification of v6.*
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Commit 4f07e0e1a9280595c9a7 removed the whatever attribute.  This
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: changed the stringification of v6.* to "v6.e.PREVIEW", which caused
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: test issues while installing the META6 distribution.
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Fix this by creating a special case for v6.*, which will compare as
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: a v6.e.PREVIEW, but which will stringify as "v6.*".  This fixes the
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: test problem on the META6 distribution and is spectest clean.
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:     say v6.* cmp v6.e.PREVIEW;  # Same
[17:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8e394fad08
[17:05] <ugexe> that seems... wrong?
[17:06] <ugexe> why does it assume a user calling Version.new("6.*") is only ever talking about raku versions?
[17:07] <ugexe> a module can have a version 6.9, and thus things like Version.new("6.*") cant be turned into some raku specific .PREVIEW thing
[17:09] <ugexe> thats definitely a regression
[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and anyway, will somebody keep tinkering that every time a Raku version does come out?
[17:22] <[Coke]> ugexe: this was in response to https://github.com/jonathanstowe/META6/issues/30, btw.
[17:25] <[Coke]> ... and now I have https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Test-META/issues/43
[17:26] <[Coke]> jdv: how often do you run blin? (Does anyone else run it?)
[17:29] <ugexe> [Coke]: yeah, the commit that broke META6 and the fix are both regressions
[17:30] <ugexe> they both turn 6.* into a version that only makes sense for internal rakudo use
[17:37] <ugexe> m: say v5.* ~~ v5.7
[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e394fad0: OUTPUT: «True␤»
[17:37] <ugexe> m: say v6.* ~~ v6.7
[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e394fad0: OUTPUT: «False␤»
[17:37] <ugexe> m: say v6.7 ~~ v6.*
[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e394fad0: OUTPUT: «False␤»
[17:37] <ugexe> m: say v5.7 ~~ v5.*
[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e394fad0: OUTPUT: «True␤»
[17:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to be honest, v5.* ~~ v5.7 is also dubious
[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> (*, *) ~~ (1, 2) is False, only (1, 2) ~~ (*, *) is True

[19:47] <jdv> [Coke]: just before release, maybe 1 to 3 times depending on breakage.  i believe i am the lonely one:(
[19:49] <jdv> its a heavy long runner
[19:50] <jdv> iirc a clean run takes me 2h and its been up to 5h i think.
[19:52] <jdv> i run it on a aws c6i.12xlarge instance usually
[19:52] <coleman> that's big!
[19:52] <coleman> how much space does the output take
[19:53] <jdv> rakudo is not yet quite performant:(
[19:53] <jdv> nothing.  its compute bound iirc.

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - define a constant star "*" so we can use =:= for comparison
[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - remove use of Whatever from the Version internals, use star instead
[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add a constant candidate for Version.new("*"), same as .new(Whatever)
[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - remove an unnecessary decont
[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - use proper increment for clarity (no efficiency reason anymore)
