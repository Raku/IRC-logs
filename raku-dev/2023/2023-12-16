[22:21] <jdv> vrurg: looks like all of blin fallout is for you:(

[22:21] <jdv> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5497

[22:25] <vrurg> Guess, it was a commit before the above PR merge?

[22:49] <vrurg> Object::Trampoline is a problem... lizmat, are you around yet?

[23:03] *** sena_kun left
[23:04] <lizmat> vrurg: will look at it tomorrow

[23:05] <vrurg> lizmat: I'll leave a comment in the blin ticket. But, briefly, ClassHOW archetypes now asking for `is-generic` method existence. That fails with find_method the module provides.

[23:06] <vrurg> Perhaps it'd be the best to bypass requests for some special method names to the standard find_method so they're taken from Object::Trampoline class itself.

[23:12] <lizmat> yeah, I recall there being such a list already...   but first... sleep&

[23:13] <vrurg> g'night, for sure! Have a good rest!
