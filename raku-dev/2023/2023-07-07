[02:51] <ugexe> i can't think of a reason to actually use * in a version that isn't just a '*'

[02:52] <ugexe> ah i guess its the only way to anchor to a e.g. major version

[02:52] <ugexe> since 2.0+ also contains 3.0

[02:53] <ugexe> brain fart

[12:25] <ugexe> eh, things like ^v1.0 is going to be confusing

[12:25] <lizmat> why?

[12:25] <lizmat> $version ~~ ^v.2.0   # any version before 2.0 ?

[12:25] <ugexe> because semver would use ^1.0

[12:26] <ugexe> and how would you write these inside of e.g. :ver<...>

[12:26] <ugexe> so for example we dont write :ver<v1.0>

[12:26] <lizmat> :ver<^v2.0> ?

[12:26] <lizmat> you can smartmatch that now ?

[12:26] <ugexe> you wouldnt write the v

[12:27] <lizmat> could you add that as a comment to the PR ?

[12:28] <ugexe> one might write the v in code (to create a version literal) but you wouldnt depend on it in an import using :ver<...> (:ver(...) sure, but META6 depends use :ver<...>)

[12:29] <ugexe> i'll comment on the PR later today

[12:29] <lizmat> ok, thanks!

[12:29] <lizmat> Damian will also have ideas about that, I hope

[12:29] <lizmat> as he's the instigator more or less

[12:31] <ugexe> also in semver ^1 is >=1.0.0 <2.0.0. and yeah our version doesn't copy semver, but we should keep in mind users will usually assume it is

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so that's why it seemed to unusual...
