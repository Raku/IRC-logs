[19:07] * [Coke] re-pings on https://github.com/Raku/roast/pull/730, which is a bit old.

[19:07] <[Coke]> Can someone approve or reject this?

[19:07] <[Coke]> vrurg did approve in Apr 2021

[19:08] <lizmat> it's not mergeable atm

[19:08] <[Coke]> I can clean it up so it's no longer a conflict if that helps.

[19:08] <lizmat> yes, please :-)

[19:08] <[Coke]> it deletes 3 files and removes them from spectest.data

[19:09] <[Coke]> ... before I do that, will it get merged if I do that? :)

[19:09] <lizmat> yup

[19:09] <[Coke]> ok, then happy to.

[20:20] <shmup> where would I have seen the little bit of docs about the helper tool z, bc it referenced my friend's tool z and i wanted to show him lol

[20:20] <shmup> (i dont even know if he knows that it's actually distributed with various distros, which this doc/thing i'm asking for ^ mentioned too heh)

[20:24] <shmup> my bad. guess it was simply the README in the repository i was reading :3 https://github.com/Raku/z 

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> never knew about z o.o

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> apparently another Zoffix special

[23:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈19 hours. 2 blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[23:53] <jdv> .seen AlexDaniel

[23:53] <tellable6> jdv, I saw AlexDaniel 2023-02-03T17:26:21Z in #raku-dev: <AlexDaniel> and it didn't need to build all the commits since 2022.12 because it keeps building commits on all branches anyway, even if it's not the main branch

[23:59] <jdv> .tell AlexDaniel releaseable6's status function seems borked.  moving on without it for now.

[23:59] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel
