[07:20] <[Tux]> test-t --race       1.010 -  1.080

[07:20] <[Tux]> test-t              1.520 -  1.586

[07:20] <[Tux]> csv-parser          3.563 -  3.702

[07:20] <[Tux]> test-t-20          19.286 - 20.211

[07:20] <[Tux]> does that seem about right or should I check the builds?

[11:13] <Geth> ¦ roast: This was testing some obsolete conceptions of QuantHash as a class,

[11:13] <Geth> ¦ roast: rather than as a role, which were all skipped.  Also contained some
