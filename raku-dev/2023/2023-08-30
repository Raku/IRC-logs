[18:26] <lizmat> dogbert17: I'm at 111 tests in make test now

[18:26] <lizmat> we've had a regression after an INIT was added to NativeCall

[18:27] <lizmat> all but one of the regressions is in NativeCall caused by that

[18:27] <lizmat> and there was one regression caused by nine afaik

[18:34] <dogbert17> aha, so these are known problems then

[19:04] <lizmat> well, since this is begin / init time related, and jnthn is working on some significant changes there, I postponed looking into it

[19:04] <lizmat> there's plenty of other stuff to look into  :-)
