[14:33] <[Coke]> Glad we're still fighting DOS in this day and age. :)

[14:33] <[Coke]> (I know, I know, it's not DOS specifically)

[15:42] <ugexe> windows commitment to backwards compatibility 

[15:44] <jdv> how relevant is windows and dos these days?

[15:44] <ugexe> windows is always going to be relevant for getting new blood because it is the gaming os

[15:46] <[Coke]> Also lots of potential corporate usage

[15:48] <jdv> doesn't mojo use emojis in fs paths?  wonder if they just skip win like systems

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm also among the people who use Windows only because of the games at this point, and you're right, it's the main OS at company as well, even though the software runs on Linux

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> For development, I'd usually just grab WSL, these days it integrates so well that one can open up GUI without any X hackery needed

[16:05] <jdv> i guess i'm in the minority then i guess.  I haven't used a win32 box in 8 or so years for dev/work.

[16:06] <jdv> too much guessing:)

[16:07] <[Coke]> (software runs on linux). I'm in a similar boat. our *product* isn't necessary windows based, but our dev is, and my day to day box is windows.

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> At the previous workplace one could get away from windows and just use Ubuntu, the main advantage being the similar environment to the product (ranging from Debian and SLES to outright Solaris 8)

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It was fun to acquire and repair SPARC hardware...

[16:33] <[Coke]> I fondly remember sparcstations.

[16:33] <[Coke]> I also do not fondly remember AIX

[16:36] <jdv> that stuff was expensive

[16:37] <jdv> i only got to play with some thanks the to cash that was set ablaze during the dotbomb period

[22:17] <tbrowder__> nemokosch: i put up another PR for File::Find for tweaks in README. the current windows workflow included ugexe's suggestions but this update changes zef test to zef installincludes a tweak for

[22:18] <tbrowder__> *to zef install FULL STOP

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> sure

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> probably will have to wait a couple of days, the situation is kind of like a jungle atm

[23:30] <tbrowder__> no problemo

[23:32] <tbrowder__> i really like ugexe's and tonyo's proj to improve module distro handling!

[23:33] <tbrowder__> a spec on top would be verra cool

[23:34] <tbrowder__> and more formal windows support

[23:34] <tbrowder__> (ugh) can't believe i'm saying that

[23:38] <ugexe> zef always worked perfectly on windows, but it cant do anything about rakudo internals

[23:38] <ugexe> the windows issues are in moarvm itself

[23:42] <japhb> ugexe: MoarVM itself or one of its dependencies (e.g. libuv)?

[23:46] <ugexe> well i guess its either moarvm or rakudo+moarvm depending how you look at it

[23:47] <ugexe> to oversimplify it all paths (that hit windows apis) need to be prefixed with \\?\ and to not use forward slashes

[23:49] <ugexe> i hard coded a bunch of such prefixes into rakudo source code and got to the point where i could work with long paths on windows. but integrating that the way it should be was gonna be more work than i anticipated
