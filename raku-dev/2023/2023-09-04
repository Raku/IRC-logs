[12:45] <NemokoschKiwi> bisectable: my @foo = 1; @foo ,= 2; say @foo;

[12:45] <bisectable6> NemokoschKiwi, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[12:45] <bisectable6> NemokoschKiwi, More than 4 changes to bisect, please try a narrower range like old=2023.04 new=HEAD

[12:45] <bisectable6> NemokoschKiwi, Output on all releases: https://gist.github.com/d71b9a60e7c78012f479a944f50463f1

[12:46] <NemokoschKiwi> it never worked

[19:36] <ugexe> for a Encoding::Decoder implementation of base64 decoder how should the consume-*-chars method work? it wouldn't know what the text encoding is

[19:36] <tellable6> 2023-08-31T19:17:51Z #raku <tbrowder__> ugexe if you have time would you mind looking at my doc PR #4354 at github.com/raku/doc? pr is for more info on using %?RESOURCES in run-time code. thnx

[19:36] <tellable6> 2023-09-01T13:48:14Z #raku <tbrowder__> ugexe i've updated the doc RESOURCES PR.

[19:42] <leont> Things are tricky because the encoded form is text and the decoded form is bytes, which is the opposite from character set encoders

[19:43] <leont> My intuition would suggest reuse may not be sensible here.

[19:45] <ugexe> hmm, i guess for something with byte strings it would work
