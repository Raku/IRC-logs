[10:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Significant or not: removed mostly because the localizations are

[10:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: generated that way as well.

[13:44] <nine_> lizmat: arguably partial class names are even the worst kind because they won't show up in a grep for the class name.

[13:44] <lizmat> indeed

[13:45] <lizmat> that's really why I would love to get rid of the Nodify hack
