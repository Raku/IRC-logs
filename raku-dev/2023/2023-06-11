[13:10] <ugexe> does anyone else have an opinion on having a deprecation message when a .pm file is found in a library path that does not contain a META6.json listing that file? -- https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5278

[13:11] *** guifa joined
[13:12] <ugexe> the people this would annoy are people that have RAKUDOLIB= set to some path like /home/foo that also contains a perl installation

[13:14] <lizmat> why would one have a perl installation in their homedir ?

[13:14] <lizmat> I guess one could...

[13:14] <ugexe> i have multiple

[13:14] <ugexe> i.e. perlbrew

[13:15] <ugexe> for instance: /Users/nlogan/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.36.0/

[13:16] <lizmat> ah, ok  /me recuses herself from this discussion on the grounds that she has no idea

[13:17] <ugexe> i suspect almost no one should be affected by that, since including ones home directory as a library path is already less-than-ideal

[13:18] <ugexe> and even users that do that probably do not expect that .pm files are being picked up as raku modules

[15:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2cff038d0: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - ␤»

[15:07] <nine> So instead of using the results of the compile time lookup we have to do anyway and putting in a direct reference to it into the call, we have to generate a runtime lookup.

[15:16] <lizmat> I'm not sure I understand?  

[15:18] <nine> The above fails right now with RakuAST because we just put the &none sub we found during compilation into a WVal and call that, but the language allows for replacing that sub at runtime. So we do have to do that lookup again.

[15:18] <lizmat> ah, ok

[16:10] <nine>  I'd really prefer proof of concepts to live in branches

[17:00] <nine> The obvious fix for my above rant is to no longer assume that values found in the setting are constant, i.e. no RakuAST::Declaration::External::Constant but mere RakuAST::Declaration::External instead. Of course, nothing in RakuAST is so easy to fix without causing regressions. Turns out my $got is default(Nil) = ...; relied on Nil resolving to a constant making it possible to pass it to the interpreted 

[17:01] <nine> trait call.
