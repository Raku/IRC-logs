[17:22] <[Coke]> masterduke, ugexe: Ended up adding a way to pick a working dir for my $dayjob project so I can set it to "C:\g" to get me a little more breating room on long path.
[17:23] <[Coke]> ugexe (.?) Danke.
[17:23] <[Coke]> *breathing
[17:25] <[Coke]> I know I still need to test the masterduke long path patch, but I expect, as ugexe noted, that it still needs some raku work as well.

[17:43] <[Coke]> I can press the actual button, probably needs a note to Tux and a ticket on rakubrew.
[17:48] <[Coke]> (and the weekly, and #raku)

[17:51] <lizmat> weekly ack
[17:51] <[Coke]> or should we wait a week to pre-announce?
[17:52] <[Coke]> Just want to make sure we eventually press the button
[17:52] <lizmat> nah, not a lot happening with MoarVM atm

[19:08] <lizmat> 803!
[19:12] <lizmat> nine: alas, when binding an NQP  True or False to a hash. passing that to an argument to a HLL method, the resulting hash can not be .rakued
[19:12] <lizmat> No such method 'raku' for invocant of type 'NQPMu'
[19:12] <lizmat> so I think somehow there's some automatic HLLizing going on
[19:12] <lizmat> that being in a hash is circumventing
[19:14] <lizmat> calling nqp::hllizefor(True,'Raku') doesn't help either
[19:15] <lizmat> so keeping the hack in there for now
[19:15] <lizmat> (Actions/extract-config)
[19:32] <nine> There is no NQP True or False. True or False are the objects defined in the BOOTSTRAP.
[19:34] <nine> Note that that's only true for src/Raku/ast/ not Grammar or Actions
[19:34] <nine> Oh you are talking about Actions? There you'd need to look up these symbols
[19:36] <nine> Or better let RakuAST node code handle that
[19:36] <vrurg> There'd be a lot of errors avoided would NQP complain about missing symbols instead of using NQPMu.
[19:40] <lizmat> thing is, I want to be able to build the entire contents of the RakuAST::Doc tree *without* needing a CHECK run
[19:45] <nine> so?
[19:45] <lizmat> ok, I think I figured it: $*R.resolve-lexical-constant-in-setting('True').compile-time-value;
[19:45] <lizmat> right?
[19:45] <nine> Looks good
