[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: abstract allowed markup determination

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Added method ::Doc::Block.allowed-markup, which returns a Map that

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: conceptually interrogated with a letter to see if that letter is

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: allowed or not.  If there is a specific ":allow" active on the block,

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: then a Map with those letters will be returned.  If there is not,

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: then either a special Map that returns True for any letter that has

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: the "Lu" Unicode property, or one that always returns False for any

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: letter.  All depending on the type of the block.

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[12:40] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Use this new functionality in the legacy podification.
