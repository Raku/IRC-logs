[15:14] <AlexDaniel> huh, .throttle is very interesting

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> the docs are really lacking so I'm not sure what's the exact use case there

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> but, for my purposes, I need :vent-at(0)

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> which is a magical value that disables venting…

[15:16] <AlexDaniel> because, you see, when you provide a callable, it already means that one value will be in the queue, waiting for the callable to finish

[15:16] <AlexDaniel> with :vent-at(1) there will be another value in the buffer, meaning that you can't have less than 2 values waiting for their turn

[15:16] <AlexDaniel> and 2 values is very different from my use case of “do something just once”

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> magic values are fun

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> couldn't "disable venting" just be :vent-at(*), so a literal magic value rather than a hardcoded meaningful value?

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> technical

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> “Your ability to open an issue in this repository is currently blocked. If you feel this is in error, please contact the repository's owner.”

[16:32] <ab5tract_> that's bizarre

[16:32] <AlexDaniel> it's alright, it's some aftermath of my ejection back in the day :)

[16:32] <lizmat> it's not bizarre unfortunately, but also unclear now how to undo that

[16:34] <ab5tract_> I guess I missed it

[16:34] <ab5tract_> Are you able to interact with that existing ticket?

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> no

[16:36] <ab5tract_> :/

[16:38] <lizmat> I guess I will have to start interacting with Github customer support :-(

[17:45] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: Limit Buildable to building rakudo-moar only

[17:45] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: 

[17:45] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: This is temporary. I just don't want to waste time building moarvm

[17:45] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: itself given that most people don't really use it. We will do this

[17:45] <Geth> ¦ whateverable/main: later.

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> okay, I think this is the last rejoin spam for today :)

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> and then the bots should start working normally, and it'll get progressively better over time

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so well, how can you say this without calling someone out too personally...

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm seeing a situation in raku-community-modules that preferably shouldn't ever happen

[17:57] *** unicodable6 left
[17:58] *** unicodable6 joined
[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> a commit has been made that broke the tests (like, an actual semantic error) and the only reason it can be hiding is that no release has been made

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> btw in 3 years it'll be 10 years of whateverable. Should we celebrate somehow? X)

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I understand that wide accessibility to upstream commiting comes from the forgiveness > permission rule and there is nothing wrong with that

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but still, it should be clear to everyone that adding a commit without either making a release or checking whether the current state could be installed is not the right way to contribute

[18:51] <buildable6> AlexDaniel, (⏳ Building…) 25028 rakudo-moar builds, 7834 archives (49.1 GB); 0 moarvm builds, 0 archives (0 GB)

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> AlexDaniel: in some sense sure. After all, this was caught by the fix I applied to the Github Actions workflow

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "why do the tests fail on all 6 workflows"

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> is the lib folder mandatory for distributions? 😩

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "provides" is also mandatory...

[19:12] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, empty lib, empty "provides", here we go...
