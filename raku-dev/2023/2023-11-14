[10:06] <ab5tract> ah, so the try seems to short-circuit early, but it still vivifies..

[14:30] <vrurg> lizmat: With regard to pseudostashes, I was raising a question on wether Foo::<Bar> must be a Failure when Bar is missing. But it never got discussed. Otherwise my point is that yes, it better complain earlier.

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> great

[14:32] <vrurg> But pseudos is a run-time (mostly) logic. I don't remember all the details about what the compiler does when resolves long names.

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> rakudo.org killed all the CI workflows
