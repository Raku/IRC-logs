[12:37] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/05/08/2023-19-pakku/

[12:58] <[Coke]> crap, I never pressed the button. Good thing I was the only one asking about it. :)

[13:01] <lizmat> now is as good a moment as any

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat ... to press that button?

[13:15] <lizmat> to do a s/master/main branch on MoarVM

[13:16] <|Tux|> not done yet?

[13:17] <[Coke]> I'll do it right now, sure.

[13:18] <[Coke]> AHAHA

[13:18] <[Coke]> Plot twist: I thought I had admin rights on moarvm, but I don't!

[13:18] <[Coke]> I swear I checked this a week ago, but I must have been looking at the wrong project. :|

[13:19] <lizmat> lemme see if I can

[13:19] <lizmat> nope

[13:45] <[Coke]> ... This is why it didn't happen last time, I guess. :)

[13:46] <[Coke]> I'm happy to do it if I get rights; if someone else does it, please also convert the PRs at the same time (saves the effort of going through after the fact and clicking each one)
