[09:47] <lizmat> nine: implemented the DOC BEGIN | CHECK | INIT phasers
[09:47] <lizmat> works fine with --doc
[09:48] <lizmat> but not without it...  need to get rid of the blorst if --doc is *not* specified
[09:48] <lizmat> wrapping it in a "if false" feels icky
[09:48] <lizmat> suggestions / ideas?

[09:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cc173d83ef
[10:04] * lizmat just realizes the CHECK phaser is NYI in RakuAST ?
[10:05] <lizmat> nine: any particular reason for that ?
[10:17] <lizmat> wouldn't that be just a case of adding a ::Phaser::Check object, add that to the statement list, and have its CHECK logic run the code, and the QAST return an nqp::null ?

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[11:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This essentially sets up the framework for CHECK phaser support,
[11:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: but basically implements this as the INIT phaser.  Next on the list
[11:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: would be to change the timing of running the CHECK phasers.

[11:58] <lizmat> nine ^^   this feels like cheating, but it gains 2 tests:  808 now

[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: implement DOC phaser support
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: For now, this works as intended when --doc is specified.  It dies
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: rather spectactularly when --doc is not specified: need to find a
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: way to disable the <blorst> from being processed in that case.
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: With regards to DOC CHECK, that just implements the CHECK phaser,
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: which currently has INIT semantics.  When that is fixed, this will
[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: be fixed as well.

[12:57] <lizmat> nine: no new fails, no new gains
[12:58] <lizmat> hoping you can give me pointers to fix CHECK phaser timing and disabling blorst processing if --doc is not specified
