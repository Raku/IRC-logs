[10:52] <lizmat> meh, it looks like https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/9f04c24247ceddb62 is too big for Geth to handle
[10:52] <lizmat> Remove "use v6" from test-files
[10:53] <lizmat> The absence of a "use v6.xxx" in a test file, now indicates
[10:53] <lizmat> that the tests are intended to succeed for the current default
[10:53] <lizmat> version as well as the future language version.
