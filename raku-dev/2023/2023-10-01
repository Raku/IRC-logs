[12:52] <AlexDaniel> okay, now pushing to Raku/whateverable should automatically redeploy the bots ðŸŽ‰

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> I wish somebody helped to slap an IRC bouncer on top of the bots, that'd be amazing

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: 

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: This creates an alternative implementation of 'find-nodes', but this

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: times it takes a full-on Code object as a `$stopper`. That `$stopper` is

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: called on each node and this check is designed to be _exclusive_, so

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: that nodes that match `$stopper` are never checked against the type

[20:09] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/main: check and the `$condition`.
