[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: add Doc::Declarator.paragraphs method

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This basically adds support for Markup to declarator docs.

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The reasons for adding a separate .paragraphs method are:

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - wanting to be able to have markup extend over a multiple lines

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - making leading / trailing to be markup aware is a bit troublesome

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 24 more lines…>
