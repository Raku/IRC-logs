[10:52] <ab5tract> ohhh, that looks nice

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> coleman: is the raku.org rework mergeable on your side? It seems to me nobody else would "claim" this review and andinus already agreed to it

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this came up in a private discussion about raku.land... how to put the question...

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> is having "N ecosystems" for Raku a good and desirable thing or not?

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean, in my opinion it is just historical development and the aim is (and should be) that there will be one

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but what is the "popular opinion" about this?

[13:20] <coleman> i will need a few days, commuting to job right now. sorry

[13:20] <coleman> haven't forgotten. just don't want downtime

[13:22] <coleman> wish me luck in Atlanta traffic

[13:22] *** lizmat left
[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay okay, good luck, take care

[14:28] <jdv> having n ecos was part of the initial intent/design iirc 

[14:57] <[Coke]> as we've discovered, though, not all ecos are equal. I suspect this may be like the "no one true compiler" where we have a defacto one that we use and recommend to use.

[14:58] *** japhb joined
[15:05] *** japhb left
[15:18] <jdv> yup.  but is raku.land part of an eco?

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh that's not what I meant

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for raku.land, it is quite commonsensical to support the existing ecosystems

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I meant it in the broader sense, whether it is desirable for Raku (or any other language I'd say) to have parallel ecosystems

[15:24] <jdv> i think its just like moarvm/jvm/etc like coke said.  recommending 1 and only supporting 1 are different.

[16:52] <[Coke]> many packaging systems allow for multiple sources - but IME, secondary sources are usually enterprise/local repos.

[16:52] <[Coke]> so that a company deploying a product can more readily control what "latest version" means.

[16:57] <El_Che> [Coke]: in my experience companies mirror an OS pkg repo or ecosystem site (eg with Artifactory) and the version on the container is declared in the build file (eg Jenkinsfile that builds the image)

[17:21] <[Coke]> +1

[17:28] * sjn reminds that FOSDEM is in the beginning of February, and that this time there's a Raku + Perl devroom \o/

[17:28] <sjn> deadline for submitting talks is on Friday this week

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's crazy early, like usual...

[18:24] <ugexe> Jenkins, what a security shit show that is

[18:55] <El_Che> ugexe: bad experiences?

[18:59] <ugexe> of course. most developers or sres i've talked about jenkins with hate everything about it with a passion

[18:59] *** japhb left
[19:01] <ugexe> you cant do anything without installing a bajillion adbandonware plugins that themselves are suspect re: security. and you cant ever upgrade because you're using abandonware plugins that aren't supported in the upgraded version

[19:04] <El_Che> yes, the plugin situation is tricky. You need to be very selective about it.

[19:04] <El_Che> the thing I dislike about Jenkins is Groovy :)

[19:06] <ugexe> i actually liked blue ocean + groovy when i first tried jenkins. but as time went on i heard lots of negative things about it, experienced my own jenkins instances get hacked, and now blue ocean itself is deprecated while they continue to work on the rube goldberg machine of original jenkins

[19:20] *** gfldex left
[19:32] <El_Che> I dislike blue ocean with passion :)

[19:33] <El_Che> it removed all useful information from builds
