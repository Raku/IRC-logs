[09:34] <lizmat> nine: I'm wondering if we actually need any custom compiler passes

[09:35] <lizmat> wouldn't supplying the compunit mainline RakuAST in a dynamic variable to CHECK phasers be enough ?

[09:50] <nine> Custom compiler passes are meant to be possible at different times, not just CHECK time

[09:53] <lizmat> ah, ok... but having the mainline RakuAST available in CHECK phaser would be useful, would it not >

[12:43] <tbrowder__> cool

[12:43] <tbrowder__> thanks

[12:46] <lizmat> having this stuff in Raku rather than in NQP makes it a lot easier to adapt  :-)

[12:47] <lizmat> afk for probably most of today&

[15:13] <[Coke]> nice to have: an :all flag for trim that gets all whitespace, not just leading/trailing

[15:24] *** rypervenche left

[15:44] <nine> That just isn't what the word "trim" means

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for what it's worth, that goes well with the spirit of Unix where most commands don't do what their names suggest xD

[15:49] <[Coke]> nine: sure it is: you're cutting away unwanted parts.

[15:50] <[Coke]> I'll see about making a module (it's easy enough to do a subst)

[15:54] * [Coke] wonders if trim-trailing should do different things on R2L strings. :|

[16:06] <ugexe> The term 'trim' has a very specific meaning in computer science though

[19:04] <[Coke]> Which is why I'm proposing a non-default adverb. *shrug* 2 to 1 against so far, not looking good. :)

[19:22] <ugexe> .trans(" " => "") is already pretty short and descriptive imo

[19:40] <lizmat> or if you want multiple spaces collapsed to one:

[19:40] <lizmat> m: dd "foo   bar baz".split(" ", :skip-empty).join(" ")
