[11:25] <ab5tract> Interesting... I've got things mostly working with flip flop but prefix:sym<^> seems to match `$a ff^ $b` (`$a ff $b` and `$a ^ff $b`) work fine

[11:26] <ab5tract> it tries to create a ^$b range object in the ($a ff^ $b) case

[11:27] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe the precedence of ff is wrong?

[11:28] <lizmat> or of prefix:<^> ?

[11:28] <ab5tract> it should be auto-getting stuff from OperatorProperties, right?

[11:29] <lizmat> yes, but maybe I copied it incorrectly into OperatorProperties: there were several sources of information in that respect, and not all of them had the same info :-(

[11:29] <lizmat> I mean, if it ASTs into a RakuAST::Infix, yes

[11:29] <ab5tract> yeah, it does

[11:29] *** camelia joined
[11:30] <lizmat> ff should have precedence j=

[11:31] <ab5tract> what's the best way to check the precedence?

[11:31] <lizmat> looks like prefix:<^> has precedence v=   which is higher... which feels...  hmmm

[11:31] <ab5tract> yeah, not sure how the parser is supposed to interpret that one

[11:34] <lizmat> checked with legacy grammar, looks like OperatorProperties is in sync with that

[11:35] <ab5tract> shouldin't it be a case of LTM?

[11:36] <lizmat> aaah... I think I now what I borked

[14:55] <ab5tract> grrr... so close to a finalized flip flop

[14:56] <ab5tract> the only problem comes from `/F/ ff *`

[14:57] <ab5tract> it's definitely a tricky one to solve, all I have to go on is: `No exception handler located for catch`

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> how to interpret these values? what do they mean to someone who looks at this chat?

[15:21] <MasterDuke> there are some other speed<N>.html pages also

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I get this part but why does this need to be sent into the chat periodically?

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> wouldn't it make more sense to at least only send it on certain noticeable events?

[16:06] <lizmat> nemokosch: in the past, test-t (as we call it) as been a very useful canary for performance regressions.. so it's good to see it done frequently

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It has no meaning out of context. Do you know by heart which test should run under what time?

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think it's as if geth was set up to post the number of issues in Raku-related github repositories

[16:21] <MasterDuke> but it has ~8 years of context. i couldn't tell you all the names and their usual times out of the blue, but when i look at that list those numbers seem normal

[16:23] <MasterDuke> the context is all the years of posting them on irc and the discussions about them. though they are much less frequent than they used to be, i assume mostly because there aren't very many large changes anymore

[16:30] <lizmat> https://irclogs.raku.org/perl6-dev/search.html?type=words&query=test-t&oldest-first=True&nicks=Tux&include-aliases=True

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the same argument could be made for Geth and Raku-related issues, it's kinda self-justificatory

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd say the difference is exactly that there are no discussions or anything, there is nothing to be talked about, and then is it really mandatory to dump it into IRC?

[19:04] <leont> Crap, if I had finished a blogpost of mine, I could have explained it easily, but I haven't.

[19:05] <leont> The flip flip operator is absolutely essential when using the language as an awk replacement. And almost entirely useless for any other use-case

[19:07] <leont> That means in Perl it's absolutely essential, but Raku much less so. Mainly because Raku's improvement tend to be on the other side: being a better language at scale.

[19:08] <leont> Perl is the best awk that was ever written, Raku never was about being a better awk than perl, but about being a better language at scale. IMO.

[19:41] <ab5tract> well, it's working in RakuAST now :)
