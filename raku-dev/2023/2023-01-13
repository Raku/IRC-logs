[12:21] <patrickb> o/

[12:22] <patrickb> Is it wrong, that a "race for @foo { }" uses HyperToIterator instead of RaceToIterator?

[12:24] <patrickb> Hm. Also RaceToIterator seems unused

[12:26] <lizmat> that feels like a bug...

[12:26] <lizmat> possibly a typo somewhere

[12:43] <lizmat> nine jnthn is there a reason why the RakuAST::Regex::Anchor classes need to be instantiated?

[13:20] <lizmat> am I the only one seeing test failures in t/05-messages/03-errors.t for a while now ?

[13:21] <lizmat> specifically about the exit code being 255 instead of 1 ?

[13:23] <lizmat> also: why are those tests using "is-run" instead of an EVAL and a CATCH block that looks at the error ?
