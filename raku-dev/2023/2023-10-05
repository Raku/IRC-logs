[11:42] <lizmat> ab5tract: ^^ bonus!
[11:45] <lizmat> and that was indeed what was blocking more L10N support   *phew*

[13:14] <ab5tract> nice!!!
[13:17] <tbrowder__> i need some advice, pls. i'm investigating various ways to install raku and have found differences in share/perl6/...  subdir schemes. is there no standard?
[13:18] <tbrowder__> the two methods i'm looking at are the binary download and the rakudo-pkg
[13:20] <ugexe> you'd probably want to show people what difference you're talking about
[13:20] <ugexe> but my gut tells me they are not different, because rakudo wouldn't understand them otherwise
[13:24] <ugexe> further, what lives in there and how it is laid out is an implementation detail that can change for any given release
[13:26] <ugexe> mind you it hasn't changed in years, but it could
[13:29] <tbrowder__>  the main difference i see is the various dirs for module pieces and shared bin files. the rakudo-pkg is missing at least one bin dir
[13:30] <tbrowder__> for now i'll take the bin download tree as standard
[13:55] <[Coke]> question for the dev team - is the compiler feature page still helpful?
[13:56] <[Coke]> It's not being updating, only has moar/jvm, which are very similar.
[13:56] <[Coke]> It was more useful when pugs and niecza were around.
[13:57] <[Coke]> If we are going to keep it, we need to have it part of the process when adding things to raku/do, otherwise I recommend we shutter it this year.

[16:13] <ugexe> tbrowder__: ah, i'd guess rakudo-pkg is removing empty directories like site/bin/ but that directory would get created if any bin script was ever installed to the site repo
[16:14] <ugexe> i'm guessing you're trying to figure out what PATH to set so installed bin scripts work, and in that case it is safe to assume that bin/ directory will exist if there is anything relevant in it

[18:22] <[Coke]> someone can print it to a PDF and shove a copy in the wiki of the github project.
[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is "it"?
[18:34] <[Coke]> what's up with JSON::Tiny - hasn't been updated in a while. Are we recommending ::Fast to people instead?
[18:35] <[Coke]> nemo - the old feature site that I proposed we kill based on your feedback. tbrowder__ wanted to save a copy
[18:36] <[Coke]> (I'd rather shut down the site and save a copy rather than keep an old site up for archeologic purposes. people can dig into the json of feature info if they want
[18:36] <[Coke]> .seen moritz
[18:36] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw moritz 2023-08-07T07:14:36Z in #raku: <moritz> ok, it turns out my mental model of raku is quite of sync with reality
[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ah okay
[18:58] <[Coke]> huh. there are items raku.land that are using artistic 1.0
[19:36] <[Coke]> I know we don't have a policy on that, but in general, 2.0 > 1.0
[19:49] <tbrowder__> ugexe: looks like a big diff between rakudo-pkg and rakudo binary is in how zef is packaged. rakudo-pkg includes the entire Zef module code in a var directory and the other has zef in a site/bin directory
[19:51] <tbrowder__> [Coke]: saving a copy of old stuff is fine, just would like to see a reference to its location somewhere
[19:57] <tbrowder__> ugexe: so if user and root both use same zef, then that should be ok if and only if the user stores his modules in his $HOME while root stores modules in the public site area?
[20:31] <JRaspass> [Coke]: I've whipped up a small change to show the distribution of licenses on raku.land - https://raku.land/stats
[21:25] *** sena_kun left
[22:35] <[Coke]> JRaspass: awesome, I'll link to that on the license snippet on raku.org when it gets added.
[23:47] <ugexe> tbrowder__: yeah, and with a default config that is what it would do
[23:49] <ugexe> m: say CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.repository-for-name("home").can-install()
[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar d66956874: OUTPUT: «True␤»
[23:49] <ugexe> m: say $*REPO.repo-chain.first(*.?can-install)
[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar d66956874: OUTPUT: «inst#/home/camelia/.raku␤»
[23:49] <ugexe> that tells you where zef will try to install
[23:49] <ugexe> when using 'auto' as the install to (the default config)
[23:50] <ugexe> i.e. first repo that can be installed to
