[11:08] <lizmat> Sanity check: we don't have anything such as "is raw" or \ for sub parameters in NQP, do we ?

[11:20] <lizmat> I'm trying to find a way to fix the "no strict; $a = 42" case, and was thinking of creating a subclass of Var::Lexical (Var::Lexical::Auto)

[11:21] <lizmat> and make that the object hanging off the match in the grammar\

[11:21] <lizmat> and then handle the resolving and QASTing inside that subclass

[11:21] <lizmat> which would mean limited overhead for the normal case

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: one step closer to supporting "no strict"

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - create a subclass of Var::Lexical called Var::Lexical::Auto

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - have the Action.compile_variable_access check for "no strict" and

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   create a Var::Lexical::Auto instead of Var::Lexical

[11:49] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - have the Grammar.check_variable method only check exact Var::Lexical

[11:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   objects, and panic if not defined
