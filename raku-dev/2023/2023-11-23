[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: make `use variable|attributes' work

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - ensure (un)definedness is wrapped if so indicated in pragma

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add "through-pragma" attribute to indicate it was added by pragma (or not)

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - adapt deparsing / rakufying accordingly

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Note that this only adds the runtime check.  A compile time check for

[10:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: lack of initializer in the :D case, will still need to be added.

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: don't apply pragma semantics to native types

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Since you can only have definite values in native types, it doesn't

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: make sense to apply "use variables/attributes" semantics to them.

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This adds an "is-native" method to the RakuAST::Type tree.

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Also fix a deparsing issue when a specific type was already specified.
