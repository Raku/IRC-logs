[15:45] <[Coke]> I see copyright statements in the source for TPF, probably need to update those so it's TRF going forward.

[15:46] <[Coke]> (but not change the old dates where there was no TRF)

[15:51] <lizmat> the legal entity YAS did not change

[15:52] <lizmat> perhaps better to change them to Yet Another Society

[15:52] <lizmat> I guess we'll need to consult with codesections

[16:03] <[Coke]> Yup, best to follow their guidance.

[16:05] <[Coke]> docs say Note: if only whitespace differs between the values, is() will output failure message differently, to show the whitespace in each values. For example, in the output below, the second test shows the literal \t in the got: line:

[16:05] <[Coke]> I see no code in is() that does this.

[16:09] <[Coke]> ah, ok. some of the calls do have a ".raku" on them, that does it. The docs verbage is probably too specific there.

[16:10] <[Coke]> m: say "this\tthat", "this\tthat".raku

[16:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8bb54bf55: OUTPUT: «this    that"this\tthat"␤»

[16:13] <[Coke]> ah, no ,it's correct, need to read the whole source, not just grep'd bits.
