[11:15] <lizmat> meh: it looks like t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t started hanging with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 a while ago  :-(

[12:12] <lizmat> looks like d31e4f62bb90d76aae13 is to blame patrickb

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> only with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1?

[12:15] <lizmat> yes

[12:29] <lizmat> well, annoying more like it :-(

[12:45] <lizmat> m: react { whenever Supply.from-list( gather { die }) { QUIT { default { } } } }    # hangs with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1
