[22:30] <[Coke]> nemo - when referring to the license, please specifically say the artistic 2.0 license instead of 'same terms as'

[22:31] <[Coke]> that should be the best practice going forward. the other usage was the old p5 way of doing it

[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> As they say - patches welcome

[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wouldn't leave a PR hanging

[22:43] <[Coke]> ERROR: Permission to raku-community-modules/URI.git denied to coke.

[22:44] <[Coke]> so instead, https://gist.github.com/coke/bc40230c32e7036e82d2d69586eefe64

[22:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's definitely not normal though
