[13:36] <[Coke]> (beers) I need to keep an actual reverse tab about how many drinks I owe people.

[13:37] <[Coke]> ... or I can just always buy a round everywhere, that's probably easier.

[13:40] <jdv> haha

[13:40] <jdv> [Coke]: here's the unvarnished truth - https://gist.github.com/jdv/55463928b66f7eec7ba697aed328c39f

[13:49] <[Coke]> OK, one of those failures is me changing the release date in the docs. :)

[13:50] <[Coke]> ... and the test output for that failure in Math::Sequences shows it worked in both cases... weird

[13:50] * lizmat is checking SBOM::CycloneDX

[13:50] <[Coke]> oh, whoops, that's a misread on my part, sorry

[13:52] <[Coke]> jdv++ lizmat++

[14:02] <lizmat> test error SBOM::CycloneDX confirmed, but not something serious

[14:02] <lizmat> m: subset A of Str where *.contains("A"); my A $b = "foo"    

[14:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9c5fc915f: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to $b; expected A but got Str␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:02] <lizmat> this also used to say "but got "foo"

[14:03] <lizmat> bisectable6: old=2025-06 subset A of Str where *.contains("A"); my A $b = "foo"

[14:25] * lizmat is looking at P5tie and associated

[14:26] <lizmat> jdv [Coke] looks like the issues with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5147b67f7abdfdec698abf2c7dd048dee5b9644f can be fixed by module updates

[14:27] <lizmat> also I think my commit of just now fixed PDF::Content as well

[14:27] <lizmat> will fix the P5tie related errors in the coming hours by releasing new module versions

[14:31] <[Coke]> nice.

[14:31] <[Coke]> Thanks~

[14:31] <[Coke]> !

[15:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈3 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[15:35] <ab5tract> what does 'specialize' mean in terms of roles?

[15:39] <lizmat> create something that can be mixed in with the given parameterization?

[15:50] <ab5tract> I wish I understood that sentence :/

[15:50] <ab5tract> R => R[Int] == speciailization?

[15:51] <ab5tract> Basically I'm trying to understand how CurriedRoleHOW interacts with ParametricRoleGroupHOW

[15:53] <ab5tract> as there doesn't seem to be much of a connection. but also CurriedRoleHOW is supposedly an intermediate metamodel object but I still see plenty of them in regular usage

[15:53] <ab5tract> m: Positional[Int].HOW.say

[15:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ac895f15: OUTPUT: «Perl6::Metamodel::CurriedRoleHOW.new␤»

[15:54] <ab5tract> the metamodel code is mind bending

[16:14] <ab5tract> m: dd [1,2] ~~ Positional[Int]

[16:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ac895f15: OUTPUT: «Bool::False␤»

[16:14] <ab5tract> ^^ wish I hadn't been using this as a sanity check

[16:21] <lizmat> well, [] is basically Positional[Mu]

[16:21] <lizmat> and roles are not bytecode, not until they are consumed

[16:21] <ab5tract> m: dd Positional.HOW.raku; dd Positional[Mu].HOW.raku

[16:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ac895f15: OUTPUT: «"Perl6::Metamodel::ParametricRoleGroupHOW.new"␤"Perl6::Metamodel::CurriedRoleHOW.new"␤»

[16:22] <ab5tract> what does "consumed" mean here?

[16:22] <ab5tract> btw, I think I may have cracked the generics thing

[16:23] <lizmat> role B { }; class A does B { }   # class A is consuming role B

[16:24] <lizmat> my $a = 42 but False   # enums provide a role with a method with the name of the enum, so .Bool will produce False in this case

[16:24] <lizmat> you could say that the but created a new Int type that consumed that special role

[16:27] <ab5tract> Ok, so I got t/spec/02-types/generics.t passing, but it feels like way fewer TODOs are passing overall in make spectest :(
