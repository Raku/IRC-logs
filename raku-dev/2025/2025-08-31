[15:39] <[Coke]> suggestion for raku.land - some kind of metric that bundles the info of most recent {commit, release, closed bug report}

[15:39] <[Coke]> inspired by https://github.com/nkh/P6-Data-Dump-Tree/issues/65#issuecomment-3239869554

[15:44] <[Coke]> (and maybe # of unclosed bugs, so something that hasn't released in a while but has no new bugs is still OK)
