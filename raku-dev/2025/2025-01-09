[15:10] <lizmat> tonyo ugexe looks like https://360.zef.pm is down

[15:11] <lizmat> or at least *very* slow

[15:14] <lizmat> ok, seems to be recovering now: respons time of ~ 3 seconds, rather than 1 minute+

[16:39] <[Coke]> I remember a recent discussion about adding some terminal codes to core - where did that end up?

[16:41] <lizmat> patrickb might remember

[16:44] <patrickb> The idea didn't manifest (yet). I guess the key issue to conclude is how we want to add modules to core. I.e. how are they versioned, dual-life, ...

[16:45] <patrickb> I'm tentatively con, ab5tract is pro.

[17:08] <ugexe> fwiw the two newest commits in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/ugexe/distributionfy-core-dists/ start the process of splitting the core modules into multiple distributions (so they can be versioned separately and more easily dual-lifed)

[17:10] <ugexe> there would still be work left trying to get e.g. `make install` to work since it would need to update the code where it installed the single core dist and updated to install multiple dists. probably need some similar smaller update for `make spectest`

[17:10] <lizmat> I hope that won't slow down the "make install" process too much: I do that a *lot*  :-)

[17:11] <lizmat> otoh, perhaps they won't need to be installed other then on an initial build

[17:11] <lizmat> so that they would just need to be re-precomped when the setting changes

[17:11] <ugexe> i dont expect it would, but i also don't think make install being slightly slower to Do The Right Thing is worth fretting over

[17:11] <lizmat> on demand

[17:12] <ugexe> i say this running make install far less than you of course :)

[17:12] <lizmat> also, it would be nice if one wouldn't need to recompile the "c" and "d" setting, when you only changed things in "e"

[17:14] <lizmat> and to further this thinking: perhaps "d" and "e" setting could become "normal" modules

[17:14] <lizmat> .oO( one can dream :-)

[17:17] <ab5tract> patrickb: I’ve been taking too long to update the problem solving ticket. I’m afraid you and ugexe have managed to convert my opinion

[17:18] <tonyo> that 360.zef.pm endpoint is all on AWS lambda/S3

[17:18] <lizmat> tonyo: yes, it was just very slow about 2 hours ago

[17:19] <lizmat> so maybe a general AWS issue?

[17:19] <lizmat> now  <1 second response time

[17:19] <lizmat> I noticed when doing a "zef update" that hung for +1 minute

[17:37] <tonyo> yea

[18:22] <[Coke]> ooh, making the interactive-prompt method slightly more complicated is causing a crash.

[18:36] <[Coke]> (ah, found an old copy of ./install/bin/raku sitting in a repl, wonder if that was borking the make install)
