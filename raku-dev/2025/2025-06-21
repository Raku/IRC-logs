[09:08] <Geth> ¦ roast: Adjust tests to new behaviour and create a 6.d test file for those

[09:08] <Geth> ¦ roast: tests that describe the 6.d behaviour, which would just return

[17:41] <japhb> Thank you for making that change, liz.  I would have been very confused by the time I got to actually testing the generated files from all the Unicode work I'd been doing.

[17:43] <japhb> I did finally find the reason the existing MoarVM Unicode tools/ scripts weren't working for Unicode 16 - One of the data files changed format (or rather, added a new line format to an existing file), and while the parsing code just ignored the weird new lines, the emitting code found that there were properties being used that didn't seem to be defined anywhere.
