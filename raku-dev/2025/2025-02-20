[07:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈2 days and ≈11 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[08:32] <patrickb> timo: My feeling has always been that there has to be some place where all the meta fields are nicely specced / documented. But up until now I did not find that place. Sounds a bit like El Dorado...

[12:03] <nine> Anyone know how the LTM implementation actually works?

[12:04] <lizmat> I think at this point, there's no active memory of that with the active Raku core devs

[12:04] <lizmat> I hope to be mistaken

[12:08] <timo> i know a little bit about longlit in the NFA

[12:08] <timo> well, LTM is really about the whole NFA, longlit is just to prefer branches that are literal matches over branches that match based on character class or similar

[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: store regex NFAs in their code object

[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This is required for LTM to do its thing.

[12:56] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5807369f78

[12:56] <nine> My that was a hard find

[12:57] <nine> 1184 now

[13:07] <lizmat> hhmmm  t/spec/S02-types/multi_dimensional_array.t failed in the run for me, but succeeds when run alone: so a flapper  :-(

[13:11] <nine> Failed in what way?

[13:12] <lizmat> no idea, it just showed in the diff with a -  

[13:12] <lizmat> this is a general beef I have with "make spectest", that I may look at soo

[13:12] <lizmat> ner rather than later

[13:18] <nine> lizmat: you may be interested in my test-log patch that's in use when building rakudo rpm packages: https://build.opensuse.org/projects/devel:languages:raku/packages/rakudo/files/rakudo-test-log.diff?expand=1

[13:19] <nine> It stores the full test output in separate files on disk and when make test fails dumps that to the console, so I can look up the actual error in the build log

[13:19] <lizmat> that's what actually inspired me to create my own "run-tests" script in the modules that I maintain  :-)

[13:20] <lizmat> so we agree we need something like this for "make spectest" and "make stresstest" and "make test"... right ?

[13:27] <nine> sure

[15:15] *** librasteve_ joined
[17:18] <timo> yeah

[17:40] <ugexe> we already do that for CI via test harnesses dont we?

[17:56] <timo> we spit out ... i think junitxml? with a plugin for TAP::Harness or something in that space
