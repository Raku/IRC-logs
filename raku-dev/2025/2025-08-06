[10:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Minor nit correction

[10:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: It's called "macos" for quite a few years now, no "macosx" anymore

[11:18] <lizmat> so, looks like we don't have a way to find out which version of NQP is running our Rakudo ?

[11:19] <lizmat> Compiler.verbose-config does not appear to have that information

[11:20] <lizmat> apart from static-nqp-home => "/Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/share/nqp"

[11:20] <lizmat> and mastdir => "/Users/liz/Github/rakudo/install/share/nqp/lib/MAST"

[11:31] <lizmat> related: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5938

[12:05] <ab5tract> Okay so I may have come across the tuits for working on the last of the (core) RakuAST blockers

[12:13] <ab5tract> I think R#5855 is the last unclaimed one?

[12:13] <linkable6> R#5855 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5855 [RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1] Could not find a compile-time-value for lexical $=finish

[12:13] <ab5tract> Except knowing nothing about how RakuDoc works, it should be a piece of cake ;)

[17:05] <lizmat> BTW, this isn't listed as a RakuAST issue per se, but may be simpler to fix: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/4868dc2a33cc77b4eb2f33e87f54261d

[17:14] <lizmat> it's the bug that is blocking using RakuAST in core (for .assuming or .sprintf) or in modules
