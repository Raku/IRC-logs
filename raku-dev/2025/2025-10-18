[16:20] <[Coke]> ok I added a note about not using the trailing zero in the moarvm branches, but I see it was used on origin/2025.080

[16:20] <[Coke]> Guess I'll try to use it and see how it breaks for me again.

[16:23] <[Coke]> ah. my other other note of "--Coke - note that jdv does not have these errors when doing a release." is also still there.

[16:26] <[Coke]> Someday we need to sort out how that is working for you.

[16:29] <[Coke]> moarvm release guide suggests running git tag -n9 to see previous release managers. The output isn't showing release managers but 2025.08's line looks Very weird compared to other releases.

[16:31] <[Coke]> er, release messages, not managers, misread. but the last entry is weird. we also have a 9999 tag in there for some reason

[16:37] <[Coke]> yay, I have moarvm.org access these days!

[16:38] <[Coke]> ... fuck

[16:38] <lizmat> que?

[16:38] <[Coke]> origingit@github.com:coke/moarvm.org.git (fetch)

[16:38] <[Coke]> It's fine, I was just prematurely happy. explains why it looked like the website hadn't been updated since I did it last! :)

[16:39] <[Coke]> and maybe why the push worked.

[16:44] <[Coke]> ah, good, push to actual repo also worked. switched over so I don't get confused next time

[16:55] <[Coke]> MoarVM release done, tagged, files uploaded.

[16:56] <[Coke]> If possible, someone please verify it looks OK, small break before restarting rakudo release.

[17:53] <[Coke]> (running spectests...)

[17:53] <[Coke]> Thanks again to jdv and all the release guide and tooling authors for making this mostly painless.

[17:55] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/cd4f905bfc2ceb596c674a8017a2a4f5 - some todo pass tests

[17:59] <lizmat> yes, that is correct

[17:59] <lizmat> because these tests actually depend on static optmization

[18:00] <lizmat> they are marked todo as they fail in RakuAST (which doesn't have any static optimization)

[18:00] <[Coke]> OK

[18:00] <lizmat> and all spectests *should* pass without static optimization

[18:14] <[Coke]> semi-regular ping: anyone interested in doing a release? Sign up here!

[18:14] <[Coke]> ... I should print like a release manager challenge coin or something. :)

[19:09] <[Coke]> release is done.

[19:10] <[Coke]> patrickb, el_che, you can work on the binary releases now, thanks in advance.

[19:10] <[Coke]> updating rakudo.org...

[19:16] <[Coke]> all done - http://moarvm.org/ isn't showing as updated.

[19:16] <[Coke]> ... my bad

[19:17] <[Coke]> pushed - should be updated shortly.

[19:43] <timo2> ab5tract: i don't have measurements yet for whether it's actually noticeably faster, and if yes by how much

[20:36] <ab5tract> Fair points :)

[20:59] *** ds7823 joined
[21:06] <timo2> i'm now writing a raku script that allows you to grab the existing NFAs out of a Grammar (for example Perl6::Grammar) and manipulate them, so you can write optimizer passes in raku instead of having to change nqp and recompile nqp and rakudo

[21:06] <MasterDuke> oh, very interesting

[21:24] *** MasterDuke left
[22:00] <timo2> not sure how to override the optimize method on QRegex::NFA in the running process, which would be necessary to allow actually overwriting the entire optimizer, otherwise we can only operate on the already-optimized NFA

[22:09] <timo2> and nqp routines don't support being wrapped

[22:19] *** ds7823 left
[23:25] <timo2> so i decided instead of forcing protoregex_nfa and alt_nfa to call our own optimize sub when it does $nfa.optimize, i'll just copy out these two methods so i can do whatever i want

[23:39] <timo2> https://gist.github.com/timo/ca341da345d0c72661165105cecf2d74  -  first version of the script. it will just call mydump on every NFA it can find in Perl6::Grammar, and it will not do any optimization, so some are absolutely enormous
