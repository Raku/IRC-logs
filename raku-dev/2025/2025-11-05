[00:10] <timo> if a cloned monitor would inherit its lockedness from the original, and you return a clone of a monitor from one of its methods, there is no way to unlock that monitor, since unlocking happens when control flow leaves the outer-most of its methods, but there is no thread of execution in the new monitor at all

[11:35] <ab5tract> timo: that's what I was thinking. 

[11:37] <lizmat> yeah, my proposal was to create a new (unlocked) object with ReentrantMutex REPR

[11:38] <lizmat> but if everybody thinks that's too general an approach, I guess I'll hack together a OO::Monitors clone doing exactly that

[11:38] <lizmat> *clone method

[12:19] <timo> do we have a "survey" of objects that have a lock/mutex/whatever inside them? i don't think a "clone" is sensible in the general case. for example, Promise only makes sense to be cloned in very specific circumstances, and even then it'll be weird if the "thens" are also copied over as well

[15:52] <ugexe> look at other languages and see what conclusions they have drawn. i don't think anything about this would be novel and specific to raku, and certain other language designers have thought long and hard about it

[16:56] <ab5tract> lizmat: is there a GitHub issue describing the problem space a bit more?

[16:58] <lizmat> ab5tract: the only one touching that is https://github.com/raku-community-modules/OO-Monitors/issues/18 afaik

[17:00] <ab5tract> Got it, thanks. Unfortunately codesections doesn’t go into *why* he would want to clone a monitors object

[17:00] <ab5tract> As someone who has never once touched clone in Raku, my mind fails to comprehend the utility

[17:01] <ab5tract> Just have a sub that returns a new monitors object with a static set of arguments

[17:01] <ab5tract> That would be my impulse anyway

[17:03] <lizmat> well, if you want an object that is almost the same as an other object, except for one or two attributes, .clone(foo => 42)  could be quick solution

[17:05] <japhb> It's also useful for making "custom defaults" and a sort of "prototype instance"
