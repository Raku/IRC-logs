[19:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: patrickbkr self-assigned Deference of a NULL Pointer https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5957

[19:46] <[Coke]> patrickb: there are more where that came from.

[19:46] <[Coke]> Do you want direct access to Snyk?

[19:47] <patrickb> I'd prefer GH issues, but if that annoys you too much, then Snyk it is.

[19:47] <[Coke]> Nope, I can get them over into GH

[19:57] <[Coke]> Added all the null pointer issues from rakudo/rakudo to gh issues

[19:58] <[Coke]> I'll rescan in Snyk as needed to close them out

[19:59] <[Coke]> there's also "path traversal", "use after free", "missing release of memory", "integer overflow" and one "user controlled pointer"

[20:01] <[Coke]> I'll eventually get them all in as GH issues, but if there's anything that sounds "fun", lemme know

[20:01] <[Coke]> .seen geth

[20:01] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw geth 2025-09-24T19:33:41Z in #raku-dev: <Geth> ¦ rakudo: patrickbkr self-assigned ␂Deference of a NULL Pointer https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5957

[20:01] <[Coke]> ... oh, right. Oops

[20:03] <[Coke]> patrickb: You might also be the right person for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5956 ?

[20:07] <patrickb> I am. The PR needs to be rejected. We explicitly want an as old as possible OS when building Rakudo. This is what allows Rakudo to run on such old OSes (that's the fun of glibc forward, but not backward compatibility).

[20:25] <[Coke]> there are 0 Critical, 1 High, 32 Medium, and 64 Low issues in the existing docker image.

[20:25] <[Coke]> 22.04 has 3M, 14L.

[20:26] <[Coke]> Is it just being used to build?

[20:27] <[Coke]> I can silence the alerts in Snyk about the dockerfile if needed.

[20:27] <[Coke]> huh. one of the mediums is perl/perl-base Improper Certificate Validation

[20:29] <[Coke]> (sadly, I think I can only put in an ignore message at an issue level; for a "project" like a dockerfile, I can just deactivate it.

[21:08] <patrickb> Coke: It's exclusively being used to build the pre built rakudo release files.

[21:23] <[Coke]> Cool.

[21:30] <[Coke]> deactivated that dockerfile project.

[21:30] <[Coke]> patrickb: do you know anything about the dockerfiles in rakudo/star? Can those be upgraded?

[21:35] <patrickb> I have near to no knowledge about star. Sorry.

[21:43] <[Coke]> no worries, thanks for helping me close some of these out!
