[03:52] <[Coke]> IMO, not all commits are weekly worthy

[03:52] * [Coke] is looking at, e.g.  Merge pull request #6049 from rakudo/release-2025.12 Will Coleda 

[03:53] <[Coke]> If you're going to do a mini changelog each week, I would suggest using the actual in-progress changelog, which gives us a change to a) consolidate or ignore as appropriate, and then b) save that work and re-use it for the actual release.

[03:53] <[Coke]> librasteve: ^^

[09:02] <disbot7> <librasteve> [Coke] … thanks for the feedback - I 100% agree. My approach to the weekly so far has been to (i) slavishly follow https://rakudoweekly.blog/lizs-workflow, (ii) automate the repeated sections and (iii) adjust a little where I think I can improve the content. As far as the Core Developments go, I am at stage (ii) with Liz items 4 and 12. Been a bit time constrained in the last week or two so I am guilty of not manually

[09:02] <disbot7> weeding these lists, tho tbh I am not very close to the core work. So yes, let’s improve that.

[09:07] <disbot7> <librasteve> My preference would be to ask a rep from the core team to write a summary “Core Developments” each week … at least until I have a better window into the priority work streams and how to describe progress in these. In particular (as a non core dev) I feel that I am missing the progress of the main v6e driver … RakuAST. Would you (or someone else) be OK to provide that?

[09:12] <disbot7> <librasteve> As an aside on the topic of Raku AST, I sense that the TPRF has some funds available (they just allocated 3500€ for FOSDEM) and I wonder if the “Raku grant application window” is open for new applications?

[09:13] <disbot7> <librasteve> PS please can you share a link to the current changelog you mentioned?
