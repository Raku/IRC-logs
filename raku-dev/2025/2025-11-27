[06:09] <melezhik_> o/

[06:11] <melezhik_> postmortem - o10r stopped yesterday , no disk space , it managed however finish 664 modules in 1 hour, which is approximately around  3 hours for 2000 modules 

[06:16] <melezhik_> and again this us with sub optimal version of patrickb: biggest agent (19 threads), had it been the latest 0.0.28 results would have been even better, but even this time is good already

[06:20] <melezhik_> this is another example when dependencies installed during module installation are marked as processed, to exclude them from list to test - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/df023e66a32788a35f683e9d8e7cec8e

[06:20] <melezhik_> zef install Calendar, install some deps, see `add module` lines in the report 

[06:21] <melezhik_> for example - `add module JSON::Fast` ...

[08:46] <melezhik> ab5tract: [Coke] patrickb please upgrade agent from the latest commit and restart it. Thanks . Hopefully this time won’t be any o10r crashes ))

[08:50] <melezhik> After this upgrade agent upgrades could be performed without container rebuild and restart

[13:19] <MasterDuke> patrickb: t/04-nativecall/26-varargs.t passes on my branch on my x86-64 linux desktop. so the warning on my aarch64 linux laptop may in fact be pointing out the problem

[13:19] <tellable6> 2025-11-26T21:38:07Z #raku-dev <patrickb> MasterDuke: Just did another quick test run locally. All green.

[13:21] <MasterDuke> and yeah, t/04-nativecall/26-varargs.c:64 from `char *a1 = va_arg(args, char*);` to `signed char *a1 = va_arg(args, signed char*);` gets it passing

[13:22] <MasterDuke> oops, line 54

[13:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #6033: Explicitly use signed char when comparing to -1

[13:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/6033

[13:29] <timo> quick question, do we have aliases inside NativeCall for both signed char, unsigned char, and "whatever just `char` means on this system"?

[13:31] <MasterDuke> i don't think we have char at all in NativeCall

[13:33] <MasterDuke> just Str, which i guess maps to "whatever just `char` means on this system"

[13:34] *** melezhik_ joined
[13:34] <MasterDuke> but patrickb would know better than i. i've never used NativeCall, at least not directly

[13:35] <timo> Str has some magic handling that makes sure we encode when going to C and decode when coming back from C

[13:35] <MasterDuke> ah, right

[13:38] <MasterDuke> lizmat: on a different topic, did you see https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/30/cyber_reiliance_act_opinion_column/ ? might be of interest

[13:39] <lizmat> MasterDuke: thanks for the link

[13:39] <lizmat> am mostly afk at the moment, but maybe sjn has some ideas about it: https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/30/cyber_reiliance_act_opinion_column/

[13:40] <timo> which is where the decision to use char vs wchar or bigger would come from, by choosing a different encoding (though since C ABI doesn't differentiate between char* and wchar* i'm not sure we bother to do anything different. i think encodings are defined over byte arrays, not arrays of larger-than-byte items?)

[13:45] <melezhik_> finally agent upgrade is just a `docker exec -it agent bash /opt/brownie/agent/upgrade.sh`

[13:45] * sjn reads

[13:45] <sjn> oh yeah, that one

[13:46] * sjn disagrees with gregkh

[13:46] <sjn> well with some of what he says

[14:04] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit

[14:07] <patrickb> ugh, I didn't know signedness could also differ. I thought only size was allowed to differ.

[14:08] <patrickb> hi
