[18:58] <japhb> I just had the great joy of blowing someone's mind with the L10N::* dists.  For all the folks that contributed to those modules and that overall functionality, THANK YOU!

[18:58] <lizmat> ooh, nice!

[18:59] <lizmat> what was it that blew their mind?  the concept, or a specific language ?

[18:59] <japhb> Special shoutout to the Esperanto localizer, because "Yeah, but do you have Esperanto?" snark was immediately followed by "Oh shit, you do."

[18:59] <lizmat> hehe...

[18:59] <lizmat> that's one of the most advanced, really

[19:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈23 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[19:01] <japhb> Both.  They were rambling in a chat about how cool it would be to have a programming language written in something other than English, to which I quietly dropped https://raku.land/zef:l10n

[19:01] <japhb> :boom:

[19:01] <lizmat> nice... ok!

[19:01] <lizmat> if they can contribute to a localizetion, that would be great!
