[00:43] <[Coke]> oh, that fixed itseld

[07:26] <ab5tract> I’ve gotten it down to two failing tests, but they are definite head scratchers

[11:54] <[Coke]> .tell librasteve I would recommend creating a "blocked" label on tickets and then ignoring that label when you're doing your day to day cleanups. Closing tickets and expecting folks to reopen them later is not sustainable.

[11:54] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to librasteve

[11:55] <[Coke]> .tell librasteve in re (https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/252#issuecomment-3318515008)

[11:55] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to librasteve

[12:18] <ab5tract> Ah, so it looks like one of the failing tests is failing also in base (with RAKUADO_RAKUAST=1)

[12:18] <ab5tract> t/09-moar/02-generic-class.rakutest

[12:23] <lizmat> confirmed

[12:50] <lizmat> ab5tract: on casual looking at that error, it also feels like some timing in UNIT::<> issue

[12:56] <ab5tract> yeah, it's turning out to be quite complicated to solve

[12:56] <ab5tract> in that I've tried dozens of things to no avail

[13:12] <ab5tract> and even what I've been attempting isn't equivalent to base, which has 730+ keys in UNIT during CHECK time

[13:14] <nine> That at check time it contains all of the setting's symbols is just a side effect of how we make symbols accessible for BEGIN time execution.

[13:30] <[Coke]> oh it DID eventually work?

[13:46] <ab5tract> nine: ah, I had a feeling it might be something like that. so there's no need to reproduce base behavior here?

[13:48] <ab5tract> lizmat: I haven't been able to crack some issues with the doc declarator tests

[13:49] <ab5tract> if you have a minute could you peruse the test output? https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/ee659bf8cd0d808500f659ed3510261e

[13:49] <ab5tract> now to try make spectest :S

[14:00] <nine> No, we definitely want that gone

[16:13] <ab5tract> hmm, can anyone else confirm whether doc-declarator.rakutest passes for them in base + RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ?

[16:16] <ab5tract> ah, nevermind, it was a problem with my environment
