[09:05] <patrickb> melezhik is there any run in progress? I could boot up the machine now.

[09:05] <melezhik> Cool , will run test round

[09:06] <melezhik> Run 2000 modules for Rakudo 2025.10

[09:09] <melezhik> patrickb: please pull the latest commit

[09:09] <melezhik> Thanks

[09:23] <melezhik> patrickb: let me know when you run

[09:26] <lizmat> japhb: looks like something changed in rakudo that broke handling of multis in roles

[09:29] <patrickb> melezhik: it's up

[09:31] <melezhik> Yep, see it . heartbeat from loving-buck-34594827, version: 0.0.36, max threads: 19

[09:42] <melezhik> ab5tract: would you like to join the party ? ))

[09:55] <melezhik> patrickb: “time: 21m | tests total: 2000 | finished tests: 268” not bad at all 😊

[09:56] <melezhik> What about CPU/RAM on agent so far ? Does it hold ?

[09:57] <patrickb> Works so far. Not yet swapping.

[09:57] <melezhik> Excellent

[09:58] <melezhik> I have added my tiny agent with 1 thread as well , he he )

[09:59] <melezhik> Ok, it’s almost 400 modules under 30 minutes , incredible)

[09:59] <melezhik> ||| TESTS STAT: time: 25m | tests total: 2000 | finished tests: 382

[09:59] <melezhik> Cc ab5tract

[10:01] <melezhik> The good thing with sparky architecture is modules installations runs in isolated short living jobs ( Linux processes technically) , so there is no memory leaching , as a process goes and dies freeing all resources

[10:01] <melezhik> Leaking

[10:03] <melezhik> The only place where leak may happen is agent sparky web server and agent main job long running process

[11:28] <melezhik> In less then 2 hours

[12:10] <melezhik> Finished . ✔️ 2000 modules in 2 hour 24 minutes . Cc patrickb [Coke] an

[12:11] <melezhik> Thanks a lot patrickb

[12:11] <melezhik> Now I can run comparison report

[12:17] <patrickb> ram usage is still at 30gb

[12:19] <patrickb> most of it taken by loads (guess 50) of `zef.raku install ParaSeq` processes and 8 `zef.raku install Proc::ZMQed` processes.

[12:26] <patrickb> there are also many `rakudo t/11-reduce.rakutest` processes still there

[12:33] <melezhik> Ok. From o10r point I f view round has finished , it’s no longer distribute load to agents . There might be some redundant jobs running on agents, but sooner or later they will finish

[12:33] <melezhik> ping from agent: loving-buck-34594827, version: 0.0.36, jobs-run-cnt: 16, max-threads: 19

[12:33] <melezhik> There 16 jobs now on agent

[12:34] <melezhik> Even 15

[12:34] <melezhik> jobs-run-cnt: 15, max-threads: 19

[12:41] <melezhik> patrickb: you may terminate all running agent jobs via UI

[14:10] <melezhik_> sorry rakudo version mixed up in this report

[14:11] <melezhik_> seems Hashids issue was for Rakudo 2025.10 and has gone for Rakudo 2025.11
