[16:22] <[Coke]> I will post the changelog drafts this afternoon US time. APologies for the delay.

[16:22] <[Coke]> Blin run had 2 false positives.

[16:34] <lizmat> [Coke]: if you feel you're ready to do a release, you don't have to wait till Sat to do it

[16:35] <lizmat> I don't think anybody will make any changes to the core until 2025.01 is there, and the blin runs have been done

[16:35] <lizmat> just thought I'd mention itb :-)
