[23:22] <[Coke]> I just joined it, and it was "created" and is empty, and had no bots

[23:22] <[Coke]> s/is empty/was/

[23:22] <[Coke]> post bot restart, seems fine now

[23:26] <japhb> Hrm.  I wonder if it needs to be registered somewhere with Libera.Chat so that ChanServ will hold it open or some such.

[23:37] <[Coke]> I still haven't fixed https://github.com/Raku/blin/issues/39; kicking off a blin run now, will try to fix this after that run (and if time permits, run another blin run to see what else is going on)
