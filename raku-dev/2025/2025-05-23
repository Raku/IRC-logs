[11:59] <tbrowder> lizmat: i just looked at core.c/DateTime.rakumod and think a :longitude arg could be added fairly easily. any objections or known obstacles?

[12:03] <lizmat> what would a ;longitude argument mean ?

[12:21] <ab5tract> tbrowder: is that for looking up the TZ automatically?

[12:21] <ab5tract> Because it doesnâ€™t really work exactly that way

[12:21] <lizmat> unless it's meant to calculate solar time ?

[12:30] <ab5tract> solar time? Like dawn/dusk?

[12:40] <lizmat> no, the time it would be at a certain longitude by just looking at the sun, when the sun is South, it is supposed to be noon locally

[12:41] <lizmat> e.g. about 100+ years ago, arrival times in the Dutch train timetable, would be in solar time... which was, well, confusing  :)

[12:43] <lizmat> e.g. noon in Amsterdam would be 30+ minutes later than  noon in .e.g. Berlin

[12:48] <nine> Which doesn't sound like something that really needs support in Raku core setting

[12:54] <ab5tract> ah, ok, TIL

[12:54] <ab5tract> seems like you need at least latitude there too though

[12:54] <ab5tract> altitude would be relevant as well

[12:55] <lizmat> why?  when the sun is straight South, it is considered to be noon in solar time

[12:55] <lizmat> altitude doesn't come into it ?

[12:56] <lizmat> nor does latitude ?

[13:04] <ab5tract> if you want accurate values for the postion of stellar objects, you need all three

[13:04] <ab5tract> the sun being one of those

[13:05] <ab5tract> you can't get an accurate sunrise or sunset  without all three,

[13:10] <nine> Solar time has nothing to do with sunrise or sunset. It's defined by when the sun is highest in the sky which is independent of latitude and altitude.

[13:18] <ab5tract> It's abnout the position of the sun. Those are the starting and stopping positions of the sun for a given place on earth. Seems weird you can do anything realistic about intermediate positions without the same information

[13:22] <nine> May seem weird, but nevertheless it's true. We are not talking about arbitrary intermediate positions here, but the zenith. That is a quite special one as it's exactly the same on a given longitude, regardless of the latitude.

[13:27] <ab5tract> Ah, ok that does make sense. Thanks for setting me straight

[13:57] <tbrowder> ok, i know it's a little weird for longitude to be in core, but a user has noticed that an unspecting user can be confused with julian-date's relation with UTC 0. the fix i believe is necessary to avoid that confusion (along with a suitable change to the docs).

[13:58] <nine> What needs fixing in the first place and why is adding longitude a fix?

[13:59] <tbrowder> the fact that getting the julian-date does not change with a timezone entry

[14:00] <tbrowder> and it shouldn't

[14:02] <tbrowder> docs are being fixed for current situation

[14:03] <nine> That in no way explains :longitude

[14:04] <nine> Just convert the given DateTime to UTC before converting that to Julian date. What else would you need?

[14:17] <tbrowder> yes, that can be done, and the docs can fixed to explain it.

[14:18] <tbrowder> *be fixed

[14:24] <tbrowder> will continue to work on docs, thnx for yr help

[14:35] <lizmat> or we can do the conversion to utc automatically

[14:36] <lizmat>       method modified-julian-date(DateTime:D: --> Real:D) {

[14:36] <lizmat> --        self.daycount + self.day-fraction

[14:36] <lizmat> ++        .daycount + .day-fraction with self.utc

[14:36] <lizmat>       }

[14:42] *** japhb joined
[14:48] <ab5tract> that seems the most reasonable approach to me

[15:02] <nine> Just keep in mind that the daycount can also change when converting from local to UTC

[15:03] <nine> Which that patch would do correctly

[16:01] <ab5tract> why Real:D ? wouldn't it be reasonable to keep as a Rat until someone wants to downgrade into floating point?
