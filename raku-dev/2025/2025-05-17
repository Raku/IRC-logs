[16:41] <lizmat> whee!   jdv++

[16:41] <jdv> patrickb: 2025.05 happened

[16:41] <jdv> .tell El_Che 2025.05 happened

[16:41] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[16:41] <jdv> all done

[16:42] <patrickb> jdv: Great, thanks! I think I'll be able to do the binary release entirely.

[16:42] <jdv> cool, thanks

[16:42] <lizmat> tests clean on my MBP withn an M4 Max

[16:45] <jdv> there's some todos, i think on all roast branches but maybe next time

[16:45] <jdv> afk for a while &

[16:52] <[Coke]> yah, I started untodo'ing passing tests and then realized that may be bad.

[16:53] <[Coke]> because that works for *this* release, but not *last* release, and technically last release was OK.

[16:53] <[Coke]> (and should still be)

[16:59] <lizmat> afaik these tests depend on the static optimizer

[16:59] <lizmat> with --optimize=off, they fail (as they do currently in RakuAST)

[17:00] <lizmat> afk&

[17:29] <[Coke]> the mimalloc reversion was accidentally bundled, but intentional

[17:29] <[Coke]> if we can get it sorted before next release we can keep it, but it broken some platforms

[19:01] <ab5tract> nine: any other notes or concerns for R#5879

[19:01] <linkable6> R#5879 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5879 Enhance feedback around named subset parameters

[19:20] <nine> ab5tract: it seems like you didn't get the comments made on specific commits?

[19:21] <nine> E.g. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/412872e0a3071dede0817279ea364157a4c3a9d8#r157190772

[19:23] <nine> And this https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9c32dae4f37b76b123a41a033b53e8d51712b7dc

[19:25] <ab5tract> I did not. I wish GitHub would surface these in a remotely visible way

[19:25] <ab5tract> Your second link does not point to anything present in the PR

[19:26] <ab5tract> Anyway,  clearly I need to brush up because I thought =:= was already negated

[19:29] <nine> The second link points at the first version of your PR and the point still stands.

[19:30] <ab5tract> I cannot see any comment

[19:30] <ab5tract> That's what I'm saying

[19:31] <nine> WTF Github

[19:31] <nine> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9c32dae4f37b76b123a41a033b53e8d51712b7dc#r156933188

[19:33] <nine> "This check belongs more in RakuAST::Parameter. That one checks itself for internal consistency while Signature's check is for inter-parameter consistency.

[19:33] <nine> A !nqp::isconcrete($_.type) should do the trick. Or after moving to RakuAST::Parameter a simple !$!type"

[19:36] <ab5tract> got it now, thanks

[20:48] <ab5tract> weird, I've moved the code to RakuAST::Parameter and adjusted it for the new context, but now I'm getting two "Use of uninitialized value element" exceptions. The worries are otherwise operating fine

[20:51] <ab5tract> It can't be coming from the exception classes, as the values are provided

[20:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/enhance-named-param-subset-feedback: Migrate to RakuAST::Parameter

[20:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/enhance-named-param-subset-feedback: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/402ef88f4f

[21:00] <ab5tract> Well, I've migrated it but now it's broken due to the above (inexplicable so far) issue

[21:01] <nine> so where are the exceptions thrown?

[21:04] <ab5tract> unfortunately --ll-exception does not surface any further details

[21:06] <ab5tract> one is for numeric context and another for string context. but that's the only further hints I can find :(

[21:07] <ab5tract> I'm just not seeing from here (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5879/files) where these exceptions could be triggered

[21:10] <ab5tract> I'd say maybe they come from the subsets themselves, but those exceptions should only appear when the sub is actually called

[21:14] <patrickb> Compiled release files are uploaded for MacOS and Windows.

[21:14] <patrickb> Linux is missing, because Azure removed support for the OS we are using in the build pipeline.

[21:14] <patrickb> I'll have to update or CI Pipeline to fix this. But that's not gonna happen tonight.

[21:15] <ab5tract> patrickb++

[21:15] <patrickb> Off to bed for me. o/

[21:15] <ab5tract> sweet dreams

[21:36] <ab5tract> `use fatal` doesn't die for these unitialized warnings either :S
