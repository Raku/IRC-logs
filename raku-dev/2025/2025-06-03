[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Consistently use .Failure at end of block

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: rather than calling the "fail" subroutine, which is about 5% slower.

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The "fail" subroutine does two things: wrap an Exception into a

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Failure, and then throw that as a CONTROL_RETURN message.  The

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Failure method just does the wrapping, and is thus slightly more

[09:53] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: efficient.

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Revert "Consistently use .Failure at end of block"

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This reverts commit 85fd89df117ebc4fb78c87b27c140cd33c1f4454.

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Apparently, the "fail"s were needed for some reason in the native

[10:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: num case.  Unsure why, but since this is just a small optimisation

[10:05] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: no further research will be done at this time
