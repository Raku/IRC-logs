[06:38] <ab5tract> lizmat: that's okay sometimes but is incompatible with unit scopes, IIRC

[06:38] <ab5tract> but you are right, there is a relatively simple way

[15:19] <jdv> vrurg: everything ok?

[15:21] <jdv> release is imminent.  please push to anything but main!

[16:11] <tonyo> japhb++

[16:43] <jdv> bit delayed:(  still today, ET:)

[19:10] <jdv> release starts now

[19:11] <jdv> sorry for the delay.  its nice out:)

[19:25] <jdv> anyone get https://gist.github.com/jdv/0cd5175b0a8a7b422d6d3499c05e4734 ?

[19:31] <jdv> very strange

[19:32] <jdv> mmm

[19:36] <vrurg> jdv: just've upgraded my macos. Why? Did it look weird on the channel side?

[19:37] <jdv> vrurg: how you doing?  just doin a release.

[19:40] <vrurg> Jobless but otherwise good. :) Thanks! Sometimes watching chats here and paying much respect to your endurance in doing releases.

[19:43] <jdv> vrurg: we are not that different then:(  text me at 8456410838 if you wish to take it further.

[19:44] <jdv> Will helps too!

[19:45] <vrurg> I think it's a mandatory part of endurance. Or its fuel, in a way.

[19:46] <jdv> i apolagize.  I mean Will Coleda!.

[19:46] <jdv> there are 2 release managers these days. More or less.

[19:47] <vrurg> I kinda know. Still, it did sound good and somewhat poetical, until you broke it. ;)

[19:49] <jdv> cool!

[19:50] <vrurg> OK, I'm off to work on a local project. Pingable as usual, though.

[19:50] <jdv> thanks!  good luck.  good to type to you.

[19:51] <vrurg> Same here! Easy release!

[20:20] <jdv> lizmat: changelogs are up.  :25 i'll conitue aka < 5m.

[20:26] <jdv> the releases proceed.
