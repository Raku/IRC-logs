[09:41] <nine> Why not just have that file declare the language version that it was written against?

[09:43] <nine> I.e. a simple use v6.d; at the top

[09:45] <lizmat> I've considered that, but felt that was less future proof?

[09:46] <nine> But that's the whole point of declaring that language version?

[09:46] <lizmat> when we release 6.e, then the "use v6.e.PREVIEW" can be removed from the file

[09:47] <nine> Which will then again make it less future proof. Adding a use v6.d; once will fix it forever

[09:47] <lizmat> otherwise the "use v6.d" will remain there for eternity, and will cause problems once 6.d is no longer supported ?

[09:47] <nine> Why would 6.d ever not be supported?

[09:47] <lizmat> because it might ?

[09:48] <lizmat> and we would be no longer around to tell why we put a "use v6.d" in there ?

[09:49] <nine> We don't have to. The use v6.d should always have been there. I simply forgot to add it.

[09:50] <nine> The whole reason for adding such a language version tag is to be safe against random future changes of the language. By definition you can't predict what those are going to be.

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ roast: The behaviour of log() / sign() / sqrt() changes from 6.d to 6.e,

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ roast: so they need to be tested as part of 6.d specific tests, *not* as

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ roast: part of 6.c specific tests.  So move them to the "6.d" directory,

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ roast: force "use v6.d" on them and add those to the spectest.data file
