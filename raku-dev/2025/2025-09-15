[13:49] <ab5tract> nine: I've finally got some brainspace to start looking at R#5855 

[13:49] <linkable6> R#5855 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5855 [RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1] Could not find a compile-time-value for lexical $=finish

[13:50] <ab5tract> now that I've had a closer look, I can see why it's complicated.

[13:50] <lizmat> ab5tract: if nine doesn't answer, it's probably because he's on a little vacation

[13:50] <ab5tract> oh, nice!
