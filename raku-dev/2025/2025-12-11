[09:40] <ab5tract> patrickb: your efforts are most appreciated

[09:40] <ab5tract> my first instinct is that the meta-obkect of an import would be the thing being imported

[09:40] <ab5tract> *the meta-object of the thing being imported

[18:42] <[Coke]> Ugh. can someone give me access to raku-community-modules?

[18:42] <[Coke]> also, https://github.com/raku-community-modules/File-Find# - how is 2colours on the most recent commit from 3 months ago?

[18:43] <[Coke]> Isn't he still in the middle of a ban?

[18:49] <[Coke]> thank you for the perms. Submitted a PR for #50

[18:49] <[Coke]> ah, there's a special channel.

[18:49] <lizmat> you mean #raku-community-modules ?

[18:50] <lizmat> :-)

[18:50] <[Coke]> aye

[19:14] <lizmat> m: my ($a,$b = 42) = 1; dd $b    # feels to me this should either just work, or complain about the default value for $b

[19:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «$b = Any␤»

[19:16] <lizmat> m: my (:$a,:$b = 42) = :42a; dd $a   # similarly, but wrong differently

[19:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «$a = :a(42)␤»

[19:16] <[Coke]> https://github.com/jonathanstowe/META6/pull/33 - this has an easy workaround, but it feels like this is a rakudo issue.

[19:17] <[Coke]> I say "easy", it's been open for nearly a year with a PR ready to go for most of that, and still hasn't been worked around.

[19:17] <[Coke]> It seems like META6 is depended on by a lot of things and maybe we should be more aggressive about making it test clean.

[19:43] <[Coke]> This is one of the few times I've wanted to reluctantly recommend we take over the module. :(
