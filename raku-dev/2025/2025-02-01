[15:39] <jdv> [Coke]: can't you just retar and push that up?

[15:39] <jdv> talking about https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1905

[18:50] <[Coke]> jdv?

[18:51] <[Coke]> ah

[19:11] <[Coke]> jdv: I could retar ... but it'd be with the same toolchain and have the same problems.

[19:34] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/03387afb1c78d4598689b7c20e52977c ?

[19:35] <jdv> that's just the mod date on the gh release - arbitrary...

[19:35] <jdv> maybe I'm missing something

[19:36] <[Coke]> Guessing his version of tar is more strict and turning that warning into an error

[19:38] <jdv> that what it sounds like

[19:41] <ab5tract> Seems to be the presence of a TZ value

[19:42] <ab5tract> The issue made it seem far more nefarious when mentioning “negative ranges”

[19:46] <ab5tract> I think `TZ= tar ...` might work

[19:47] <ab5tract> or `set -gx TZ; tar ...`if you are using `fish` like the 90s actually happened :)

[19:49] <jdv> how did you come to that conclusion?

[20:00] <ab5tract> by searching for timezone in `man tar`

[20:01] <ab5tract> It's pretty clear to me that `Treating date '2025-01-25T17:46-0500' as 2025-01-25 17:46:00` is referencing a trailing TZ value

[20:02] <ab5tract> But now that I'm reading the gist on my laptop instead of a phone, I guess the source of the breakage could be separate

[20:02] <jdv> oh, i thought you meant something to do with the original taring or the untaring person

[20:02] <jdv> yeah, that's just noise on my idea

[20:03] <ab5tract> Ah, I see. No I was hoping to help [Coke] and you in fixing

[20:03] <jdv> thanks!

[20:03] <[Coke]> wouldn't surprise me that it's a TZ value since my original error with this was LOCALE related

[20:03] <ab5tract> but... why is there a hidden elisp file in the moarvm directory anyway? 

[20:03] <ab5tract> or should I rather not ask :)

[20:05] <[Coke]> ?

[20:06] <[Coke]> ah. Guessing someone checked in their editor file?

[20:06] <[Coke]> dates from 2015

[20:07] <[Coke]> also an .editorconfig

[20:12] <ab5tract> As an aside, I'm always amused (in a I-kind-of-want-to-cry kinda way) when someone running an almost 20 year old toolchain files an issue report without even mentioning it until the fourth or fifth interaction

[20:12] <ab5tract> Apparently gnutar has been dying on this issue for decades https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/227503

[20:12] <ab5tract> oops, wrong link

[20:17] <ab5tract> Anyway, if I was using a bespoke platform, I'd at least google for the apparent answer on my end before filing the issue. Apparently `--warning=no-timestamp` should fix it

[20:17] *** librasteve_ joined
[20:17] <[Coke]> yah, that version of gnutar was released in 2007

[20:18] <[Coke]> ab5tract: can you add that to the ticket?

[20:18] <ab5tract> Sure thing

[20:18] <[Coke]> We will try to avoid the warning in future releases, but I don't think we need to make a tarball for this particular case.

[20:18] <ab5tract> But the other side of this is that best practices for reproducible builds is apparently zero-ing out timestamps

[20:19] <ab5tract> So it could actually be a result of all the awesome work that timo++ has been putting in

[20:21] <[Coke]> I assumed it was because we're using some arcane tar invocation that isn't entirely portable.

[20:21] <[Coke]> (and I hope to rip that out of moarvm and use a much simpler tar option in 2025.02)

[20:24] <ab5tract> Might be.. but I found the fix in a quite recent issue report from opensearch where this has apparently been introduced by following gradle recommendations for build reproducibility

[20:25] <[Coke]> Please feel free to add notes to this ticket or the linked one.

[20:25] <[Coke]> if there are other changes we should be making to the tar command in moarvm, need to do something similar for nqp/rakudo

[23:18] <timo> the changes related to reproducibility of builds does not include anything with taring, those parts are handled for us by things like the debhelpers invoked by the debian/control scripts, and those aren't in the upstream moarvm repo at all

[23:32] <ab5tract> timo: ah, got it. looks like we've got some delving yet to do

[23:32] * ab5tract recently found out that his love of the world delving is symptomatic of being an absolute robot
