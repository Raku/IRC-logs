[12:12] <lizmat> nine: we don't have a way (yet) to turn a Parameter object into a RakuAST::Parameter object yet, do we ?

[12:30] <nine> Not that I'm aware of. What would you want that for?

[12:36] <lizmat> R#2599

[12:36] <linkable6> R#2599 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2599 [performance][Will be addressed in RakuAST] .assuming is painfully slow

[12:36] <lizmat> aka, building the new Callable with RakuAST, EVALling that

[12:37] <lizmat> so far, it looks like it should be about 20x as fast as the current approach

[12:51] *** guifa left
[13:14] <lizmat> :w

[13:16] <nine> Looks like there's another spec test for multi dispatch of native rw args.

[13:16] <nine> Quick reminder:

[13:17] <nine> m: multi x(int $x is rw) { 1 }; x(my int $i = 42);

[13:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 58d923513: ( no output )

[13:17] <nine> m: multi x(int $x is rw) { say $x }; x(my int $i = 42);

[13:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 58d923513: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller x(BOOTInt); the following candidates␤match the type but require mutable arguments:␤    (int $x is rw)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:18] <nine> Those spec tests work on the old frontend only because the optimizer can statically inline those extremely simple functions. When it can't, dispatch fails.

[13:19] <lizmat> interesting... then these tests should be marked TODO  or skipped ?

[13:20] <nine> Yes, that'd be appropriate.

[13:23] <lizmat> I wonder how much would break on spectest while running with --optimize=off

[13:28] <lizmat> first prototype of .assuming based on RakuAST, replacing 1 of 3 positional args, runs 43x as fast as the current version of .assuming

[13:35] <nine> 27 spectest files fail when run with --optimize=off

[13:35] <lizmat> wow

[13:37] <nine> 9 with --optimize=0

[15:17] <nine> A very straight forward fix for one more. However, something very odd is happening. Suddenly 3 tests that have been passing for a long time started to fail. All failures seem module related. The failures are not caused by my change though. They still fail when I go back to earlier commits.

[15:18] <nine> It's t/spec/S11-compunit/rt126904.t t/spec/S11-modules/nested.t and t/spec/S32-hash/perl.t

[15:50] <patrickb> Anyone knows if it's possible to get rid of the "master" branch in the rakudo repo? On Moar the "master" branch is gone. Can we somehow do the same in Rakudo? It has potential to confuse people (given it points to some 2022.12 commit).

[16:01] <[Coke]> +1

[16:27] <nine> Oh, those 3 only passed because I did those no-optimizer test runs and didn't clean the .precomp dirs in between

[16:30] <nine> 1192 seems to be the correct count
