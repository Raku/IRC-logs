[00:16] <ugexe> timo: why do you use `default { }` sometimes and not others in that PR?

[00:17] <ugexe> it does feel a bit intentional though so i'm mostly just pointing it out

[00:18] <timo> when i don't want it automatically rethrown, i think? i should probably look through the final diff to see if what i wrote makes actual sense

[09:31] <ab5tract> timo: maybe it's my old BeOS thinking but what if we used metadata fields on the file instead?

[09:56] <ab5tract> I think all major OSes support them, but then again Apple still uses case-insensitive filenames so 🤷

[17:35] <[Coke]> ww

[18:13] <ab5tract> ugexe: lol

[18:17] <lizmat> hmmm... I appear to be unable to upload a raku community module to fez

[18:17] <lizmat> auth 'zef:raku-community-modules' in META6.json does not match auth 'zef:lizmat' or 'zef:' or 'zef:

[18:18] <lizmat> but the .fez-config.json file *does* mention that I'm in the "raku-community-modules" group

[18:21] <lizmat> it's been a while since I did a community modules upload...  did I miss something ?

[18:21] <lizmat> ugexe tonyo ^^

[18:35] <lizmat> well, at least with "mi6 release"

[18:54] <japhb> Sounds like the problem I had releasing a new Terminal-Print a while back; that's also owned by a group instead of an individual, and also would not allow upload.

[18:54] <lizmat> the odd thing is, that looking at the App::Mi6 code, I don't understand how it could have ever worked

[18:56] <lizmat> japhb: so how did you fix that ?

[18:58] * lizmat hacked a local copy of App::Mi6 that doesn't look at the auth

[18:59] <lizmat> which now allows release

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> there was an issue with the server running out of space, hopefully it should be better now

[20:49] <AlexDaniel> just need to trigger redeploy on a couple of things, whateverable included :)
