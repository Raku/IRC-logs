[12:06] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2025-04-22T12:06:41Z”

[12:26] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/04/22/2025-16-grant-completion/

[12:26] <lizmat> and with that, the batteries need recharging again&

[15:12] <[Coke]> El_Che:  were you able to use timo's suggestion to get a build?

[17:07] *** [Coke] left
[17:27] *** [Coke] joined
[17:55] <[Coke]> .

[18:55] <El_Che> [Coke]: sorry, I haven't had the time. I am pretty sure that reverting the module will break stuff. I can around here add a block for alpine: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/master/actions/build.sh#L51

[18:56] <El_Che> can some one point me to the git command to do it on a correct way?

[18:56] <El_Che> git revert 03e4fee65d1782f5aa7128d97169fb8601e4ac5b ?

[18:56] <linkable6> (2025-03-29) https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/03e4fee65d Bump mimalloc to v2.2.3

[19:03] <timo> after "git revert" you may have to "git submodule update" to actually check out the submodule's contents, but i think Configure.pl also does that

[21:20] <El_Che> timo: sadly, I do a tar.gz detached head when getting the source

[21:20] <El_Che> so a git revert would be valid for all distros

[21:20] <El_Che> not only alpine

[21:22] <El_Che> I'll do that as a test to see if alpine builds
