[18:12] <[Coke]> anyone have an issue with these conditions: https://partners.snyk.io/prm/English/c/developer_project_application

[18:14] <[Coke]> they do open source scanning (vulnerabilities, licenses, etc.), and you can get free setup for your open source project if you 1) don't have a corporate sponsor, 2) attribute snyk in your readme on the website, and grank snyk permission to use the logo "and related content" on their website.

[18:14] <[Coke]> Going to submit raku (but they will probably only be able to scan moarvm)

[18:15] <[Coke]> But that'll (probably) be a step towards them adding raku support in the future. (be nice if their project scanning recognized meta6.json files, etc.)

[18:19] <[Coke]> Submitted, but can back out if anyone sees an issue.

[18:47] <lizmat> [Coke]++

[20:48] <[Coke]> we use it at dayjob, does a good job on JS & .NET

[20:49] <El_Che> [Coke]: we use trivy in our CI: https://trivy.dev/

[20:49] <El_Che> (and sonarcube)

[20:55] <[Coke]> we also use sonar/cube/cloud/

[22:32] <japhb> I'd be happy with anything (with reasonable licensing terms for FOSS projects) that helps us nail more bugs in MoarVM.  Because they always bubble up.

[22:35] <japhb> Oh that reminds me.  lizmat, rak has a resource exhaustion bug in that it doesn't limit its concurrency settings to a combination that fits within the user's max open files limit.  I discovered this running rak on a box with 20 hardware threads, where rak defaulted to 19 x 64 concurrency, but I only had 1024 max open files.  Ooopsie.
