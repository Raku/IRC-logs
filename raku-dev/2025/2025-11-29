[00:32] * [Coke] wonders if he has a local copy of the github key?

[00:33] <[Coke]> ah, no, this isn't that key, this is the key for the signed tar files.

[00:33] <timo> using gpg --send-keys with the key id is also a good idea to have it on the public key server network

[00:34] <[Coke]> crap, this key expires 2026-01-25

[00:35] <[Coke]> Still worth doing? Will I have to add a second entry in feb?

[00:38] <[Coke]> I apparently also have a smaller key than the other humans on that page. :)

[00:43] <[Coke]> key sent

[00:43] <[Coke]> we might want to add these to the release guide instead of just "create a gpg key"

[00:45] <[Coke]> timo: https://rakudo.org/downloads/verifying#gpg2-key-list updated.

[00:46] <[Coke]> thanks!

[00:47] <[Coke]> reminder to myself, that key exists only on the blin box. :|

[00:48] <timo> having the key up is still important for people who want to download older versions and ensure they are what they are supposed to be

[09:59] <patrickb> I currently can't boot the computer, the room is in use by guests

[09:59] <patrickb> In about 6 hours I can again.

[09:59] <patrickb> Is there currently a run in progress?

[10:02] <melezhik_> yep, I have run test round 

[10:04] <melezhik_> once any agent taps in it will start distributing tests on it

[17:21] <[Coke]> melezhik: I restarted my agent here

[17:21] <melezhik> Cool! 😎

[17:21] <melezhik> Did you pull the latest commit?

[17:21] <[Coke]> Team - we have anything in rakudo so far that we want in a release for December?

[17:22] <melezhik> Oh. I see

[17:22] <[Coke]> melezhik: 3c4d923

[17:22] <melezhik> Thanks

[17:22] <melezhik> Actually it’s printed in o10r as well

[17:22] <melezhik> heartbeat from cokebot-44860256, version: 0.0.31, max threads: 4

[17:24] <melezhik> Heads up since version , no need to rebuild and restart agent for upgrade

[17:24] <melezhik> docker exec -it agent bash /opt/brownie/agent/upgrade.sh

[17:25] <melezhik> This will upgrade agent and restart agent job

[17:25] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/brownie/blob/main/agent/README.md#how-to-upgrade-agent-without-rebuilding-and-restarting-docker-container

[17:28] <[Coke]> If we get a published container, I can try to setup a container runner in azure (can't run docker on an azure vm at least by default)

[17:29] <[Coke]> don't rush, as I have no idea what the pricing on that is. :)

[17:33] <melezhik> First job report from [Coke] bot - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/job.2.report/1305 looks good

[17:33] <melezhik> There’s lines “installed as deps of module” which is what u wanted

[17:51] <melezhik> I wanted to

[18:38] *** melezhik_ joined
[18:39] <melezhik_> [Coke]: I don't know why, but I can't no longer publish images to docker hub ( I get error / access denied or something  every time ), but here is a Dockerfile for agent - https://github.com/melezhik/brownie/blob/main/agent/Dockerfile

[19:25] *** melezhik_ left
[19:52] <[Coke]> Done

[20:00] *** melezhik left
[20:11] <[Coke]> <head><title>413 Request Entity Too Large</title></head>

[20:12] <[Coke]> Template::Protone, probably

[20:34] <disbot6> <melezhik.> Ok. I see for some reasons agent.job jobs stuck on your agent, only see pings , not job reports . Wonder why this could be

[20:35] <disbot6> <melezhik.> http://brw.sparrowhub.io/file_view/agent.1.ping/xryjkgunqcwifotpblva.39293/r.data.txt

[20:36] <disbot6> <melezhik.> Those 4 processes keep running but nothing happens

[20:37] *** melezhik joined
[20:46] <disbot6> <melezhik.> I guess something prevents sending results back to 010r … I expects agents agent.job job fail now … ?

[21:21] <disbot6> <melezhik.> Ok , finally reports came through …

[21:22] <[Coke]> the web server is running. what else do you want me to check?

[21:22] <[Coke]> ah

[21:39] <disbot6> <melezhik.> Ok. Reports seems keep coming which is good. There is I guess I stuck job which runs over 1 hour

[21:39] <disbot6> <melezhik.> root     31552  1.2  1.4 1917116 296648 pts/0  Sl+  20:08   1:06 /usr/share/perl6/site/bin/../../../../bin/rakudo /usr/share/perl6/site/bin/sparky-runner.raku --marker=agent.job_1764445558 --dir=/root/.sparky/projects/agent.job_1764445558 --trigger=/root/.sparky/projects/agent.job_1764445558/.triggers/nmejghapucdwxfblyosk.130 --make-report

[21:41] <melezhik> On UI it should be noted as agent.job_1764445558 job

[21:41] <melezhik> If you send me it’s log it’d great, so we know why it runs so long

[21:42] <melezhik> And btw those long running jobs maybe terminated via UI as well as, on the job page there is “terminate” button

[21:43] <melezhik> Other then  that I guess everything is good , it’s just at some point reports were not coming and I thought there were problem again between agent and o10r , but now it looks good

[21:45] <melezhik> I guess maybe this were a streak of heavy modules with long time tests

[21:47] <melezhik> Long running jobs is better to terminate as they throttle performance, and now agent effective runs in 3 threads , with one out 4  thread being stuck
