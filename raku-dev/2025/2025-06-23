[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Make sure coercion don't introduce a container

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Commit f95f85a made sure that Mu.item returns a read-only container

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: if the invocant wasn't already container (as opposed to a right

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: value before that).

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This somehow caused a test failure in the PDF distribution (see #5916).

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 39 more lines…>

[11:29] <lizmat> *doesn't   meh

[12:19] <[Coke]> jdv: anything using one of the test modules always dies.

[12:19] <tellable6> 2025-06-22T20:05:53Z #raku <melezhik> [Coke]: rakudo head on alpine went fine - since this commit - https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/report/rakudo-head/24900

[12:20] <[Coke]> because of the JSON::Class bug

[12:20] <[Coke]> so it "works", but only on a subset of the ecosystem.

[12:20] <[Coke]> If you can do a run, great (I had problems with my local setup couldn't get to my IRC box yesterday)

[12:22] <[Coke]> Otherwise I'll start one this morning.

[12:22] <[Coke]> sorry, not a bug in JSON::Class, to be clear, a bug in the way Blin handles two completely different modules with the same name.

[14:00] <[Coke]> jdv: I need to add an option to blin to skip a bunch of the setup so we can quickly retest stuff assuming our previous downloads worked.

[15:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈3 hours. 1 blocker. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[15:50] <jdv> im not doing another run.  11h a month is enough unless its necessary.

[15:50] <[Coke]> ok, I'll kick one off then

[15:51] <jdv> [Coke]: i dont get it.  why?  retesting is just a zef call away?

[15:51] <[Coke]> have you done a blin run since last release?

[15:51] <[Coke]> I haven't

[15:51] <jdv> yday?

[15:51] <[Coke]> ok. didn't see that.

[15:51] <jdv> what are you talking about?!

[15:52] <jdv> holy ... man:)

[15:52] <[Coke]> v. good

[15:52] <jdv> youre too funny 

[15:52] <[Coke]> ?

[15:52] <[Coke]> I feel like we're having two very different conversations. :)

[15:53] <jdv> i guess thats possible. 

[15:54] <[Coke]> I didn't see the blin issue you posted. now that I'm synced, we're all good. Now I have to fix this bug by the next release. :)

[15:54] <jdv> in any case i think we're in the clear with blin right now.

[15:55] <jdv> yup, its also in todays and ydays scrollback

[15:55] <jdv> happy monday

[15:56] <[Coke]> \o/

[15:56] <jdv> at some point parallelizing blin out more will have to happen. 

[15:57] <jdv> a 12h run is pushing the limits of reasonablenesz.

[15:58] <[Coke]> ... run more threads?

[15:58] <jdv> multiple box workers or a huge single box

[15:58] <jdv> but tprf or someone will have to pay for that

[15:59] <[Coke]> Yah, having resumable/composable runs, central DB, etc.

[15:59] <[Coke]> then we can throw more azure boxes at it, e.g.

[15:59] <jdv> why azure?  but sure.

[15:59] <[Coke]> would be great to be able to scale out automatically. :)

[15:59] <[Coke]> because I'm already in it?

[16:00] <[Coke]> but I'm not tied to it. It's just a place to run a VM

[16:00] <jdv> from what i hesr azure is one of the worst but ok

[16:00] <[Coke]> *sigh*

[16:01] <[Coke]> Yes. The particular cloud hosting service is not important, I agree.

[16:01] <jdv> i judt knkw what my ops peeps tell me

[16:01] <[Coke]> leaving. back later
