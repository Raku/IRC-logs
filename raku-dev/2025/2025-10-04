[12:15] <patrickb> melezhik: I've had a look. Arm64 is pretty doable (I lean towards use hetzner to create a throwaway server for the build, alternative: Google cloud, RPi in basement).

[12:15] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[12:17] <patrickb> melezhik: RISCV is a different beast. I don't know if anyone ever managed to get Rakudo building or running on RISCV at all. That would be the first step.

[12:17] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[12:20] <patrickb> melezhik: Do you know whether the rocky Linux people managed to build or run Rakudo?

[12:20] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[12:22] <patrickb> https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel%3Alanguages%3Araku/rakudo

[12:22] <tellable6> 2025-10-02T11:10:34Z #raku <melezhik_> patrickb: it'd be cool to add binary for arm64and risc-v - it'd be extremely helpful for folks from rocky linux team. No pressure though ))

[12:23] <patrickb> melezhik: it seems riscv actually does compile already. Yay!

[12:23] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[12:30] <patrickb> ab5tract: Do you know whether zig allows cross compiling across architectures?

[12:31] <patrickb> according to https://zig.guide/build-system/cross-compilation/ it does...

[12:32] <ab5tract> Yeah I was the under impression that it does

[12:43] <patrickb> ab5tract: Then I won't do anything about arm64 and RISCV. Let's see how zig turns out. If that works out it seems all of our platform related wishes are automatically solved.

[12:43] <patrickb> ab5tract Thanks for bringing this up!

[12:48] <ab5tract> patrickb: cool! I’ll prioritize organizing my patch so that we can get explore its possibilities

[12:50] <patrickb> ab5tract: Did you investigate whether the perf difference of the binaries of zig vs other compilers is acceptable or not?

[12:51] <patrickb> Zig seems to be the perfect solution for us with the one potential downside being perf. But I'd be very willing to accept a few percents of perf loss.

[12:52] <ab5tract> Re: perf differences, zig users clang exclusively for production builds at the moment

[12:53] <ab5tract> That is, their self hosted compiler is only enabled in debugging for now, and I think even then it’s still behind a feature flag

[12:53] <patrickb> I guess the best way forward is to just create a first zig Rakudo build and run a few measurements on our own.

[12:54] <ab5tract> https://github.com/ab5tract/MoarVM

[12:54] <ab5tract> Ahh, dang, I was hoping it would link to the branch

[12:55] <patrickb> ab5tract Please don't feel too much pressured by this feature request. In general it's always possible to build a Rakudo oneself if no precomp binary is available. It is a convenience thing.

[12:55] <ab5tract> zig-support is the branch

[12:56] <ab5tract> patrickb: can you give it a try and see if it works for you?

[12:58] <patrickb> I'll do! (I hope to do so in the evening. pretty busy right now)

[12:58] <ab5tract> I don’t know whether there are zig compiler features that are “unlocked” by using a native zig build (eg using their build.zig approach rather than simply swapping in ‘zig cc’ for $CC

[12:58] <ab5tract> Likewise no pressure :)
