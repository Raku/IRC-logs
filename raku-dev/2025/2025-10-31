[11:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Mark Hyper class as an implementation detail

[11:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Because it is:

[11:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:  - no direct tests for it

[11:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:  - no documentation for it

[14:38] <melezhik3> o/

[14:39] <melezhik3> we are doing brownie ( blin20 ) test round in 8 agents right now 

[14:39] <melezhik3> here the link to watch it in real time - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/builds

[14:40] <melezhik3> or this one - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/brw-orch/1 ( however due to weird buffering from orchestrator ) this web socket page refreshed in chunks

[14:41] <melezhik3> any agent.report is report sent back from any agent with results

[14:41] <melezhik3> there is 5 modules in report

[14:41] <melezhik3> if any of module zef install fails , report is red

[14:41] <melezhik3> one can get details on failure from report artifacts 

[14:42] <melezhik3> for example - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/agent.report/110

[14:42] <melezhik3> then Artifacts tab

[14:42] <melezhik3> then Math::Libgsl::Constants.log   view

[14:43] <melezhik3> or the same details ( plus successful modules ) on report page 

[14:44] <melezhik3> stat for 30 minutes - ||| TESTS STAT: already finished tests: 25 | tests in progress: 345 | tests total: 996

[14:45] <melezhik3> numbers may have some fluctuations as the main page gets refreshed with buffering  

[14:47] <melezhik3> thanks ab5tract: for providing agents.

[14:48] <melezhik3> every agent is small enough , it has AFIK 1 CPU core, not sure how much RAM it has

[14:50] <melezhik3> Job distribution algorithm is quite clever. If one or some agents go offline, orchestrator  will redistribute the load that had been sent to them to other online agents

[14:53] <melezhik3> also if some tests get returned for processing to common queue if the orchestrator has not received results on them within 30 minutes , this allows to handle situation of network partition or any other unexpected fauilres when results get sent back from agents back to orchestrator

[14:55] <melezhik3> example

[14:57] <melezhik3> there are still errors may occur , hopefully this will be ready for usage soon )

[15:03] <melezhik3> found minor issues, restarted o10r
