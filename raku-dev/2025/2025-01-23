[15:13] <[Coke]> lizmat: correct, sorry. expected complete in 2.5 hours at the moment.

[15:13] <tellable6> 2025-01-23T14:56:36Z #raku <guifa> [Coke]: they're going to open a second round for talks on Feb 1

[15:13] <[Coke]> (on top of other things, had a prod issue for $dayjob and an internet outage at home.)

[15:13] <[Coke]> guifa, thanks.

[17:02] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/545c9e4e099f602f2f85846b94fd050cb03f04fa/lib/CompUnit/Repository/Staging.rakumod#L58-L63

[17:02] <ugexe> does this seem wrong to anyone else?

[17:02] <ugexe> it is using .chars on a path to try to remove a path prefix

[17:08] <ugexe> i guess maybe its fine, i'm mostly just wondering if that would be fine on e.g. windows using wide characters in paths such as chinese

[17:10] <lizmat> feels that should probably be using .relative somewhere?

[17:12] <ugexe> yeah that would at least be easier to reason about

[17:21] <timo> as long as it's using Str, it shouldn't accidentally break when using wide characters, since they should turn into a single grapheme cluster under unicode's grapheme cluster rules

[17:21] <[Coke]> lizmat, jdv - should *all* "bump nqp" commits be under ignore and delete, or do they have to be considered per?

[17:22] <lizmat> I think they're always listed under ignore?

[17:24] <[Coke]> excellent. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a nuance.

[17:33] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft updated

[17:33] <[Coke]> let me know if anything looks wonky. checking moarvm one now.

[17:35] <[Coke]> Also may add a CI section.

[17:40] <[Coke]> https://github.com/moarvm/moarvm/wiki/changelog-draft

[17:40] <[Coke]> Done - please let me know any issues.

[17:57] <lizmat> [Coke]: done my bits on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[17:58] <[Coke]> quick turnaround, thanks!

[17:59] <jdv> igmore

[17:59] <jdv> ha.  ignore.

[18:00] <jdv> the associated commits are useful but not those, imho.  idk:)  up to you.

[18:00] <jdv> similar to a merge commit

[18:10] <[Coke]> ?

[18:33] <jdv> i mechanically put merge commits and bump commits down there

[18:33] <[Coke]> ahhh, yes, that's what I did as well, I thought

[18:33] <[Coke]> excellent

[18:34] <jdv> fabulouso

[18:39] <[Coke]> Sí!

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: 

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: Fixes #1238.  The problem was caused by the fact that Hash.clone

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: would create a fresh copy of its invcant, instead of cloning it.

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: Creating a fresh copy is ok if the invocant is of type core Hash,

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: but if anything is mixed in, then the fresh copy will lose any

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: additional attributes (as #1238 showed.

[18:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01:

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: 

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: So that calling clone on a Hash/Map type object either works (if

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-post2025.01: no twiddles were specified), or fails for the proper reason (if

[20:36] <tbrowder> i'll remove it...

[20:42] <[Coke]> sorry, just did!

[20:42] <[Coke]> it's in the history if you wanted to save a copy, I can send you the .md

[20:46] <tbrowder> no, that's ok, i could never find it again anyway!

[20:48] <tbrowder> i basically copied over the original and tidied it a bit,, making sure the original (but closed) PR is referenced with links to tests, etc.

[20:49] <tbrowder> i'm sorry i can't make the Raku conf, do they ever allow paid ppl video access during the conference?

[20:49] <[Coke]> like a hybrid in person/zoom thing?

[20:50] <[Coke]> I don't know if he's the right person to ask, but I'd ping Util to check

[20:50] <tbrowder> yes!

[20:50] <tbrowder> will do

[20:50] <[Coke]> I'm going, but only because the spouse likes going on long drives mainly for the drive. :)
