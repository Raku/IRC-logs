[13:54] <melezhik_> [Coke]: ab5tract: can we run another brownie round ? I'd like to rebuild reports for 2025.11/2025.10 and then run comparison ...

[13:55] <[Coke]> Sure, will update and start.

[13:55] <melezhik_> thans

[13:55] <[Coke]> running

[13:56] <patrickb> joining soon 

[13:58] <melezhik_> patrickb: ++

[14:07] <ab5tract> It will be a bit before I can join

[14:10] <[Coke]> I think, btw, that a blin run (with old and new versions - and can't run them separately) is about 12 hours on that one azure box.

[14:11] <[Coke]> I think JDV was getting much lower times on his local box (with obvs. different specs)

[14:22] <melezhik_> coke agent jobs stuck a bit ? https://gist.github.com/melezhik/5f776d0bf951c25e7fb997790191bf7a

[14:22] <melezhik_> already 14 minutes

[14:26] <melezhik_> ok, first report came in

[14:58] <[Coke]> opened a ticket, pinged anton

[14:59] <melezhik_> [Coke]: you are looking at agents reports, right ?

[15:00] <melezhik_> I can extend reporter and show all failed modules, so we can use that to open tickets for devs

[15:00] <[Coke]> Sure - I just happened to catch that one browsing output

[15:03] <melezhik_> yeah

[15:04] <[Coke]> For releases, our goal is "no new breakages", but overall, anything that is known to fail should eventually have a ticket opened. my goal with blin was to add all known failures to a skiplist

[15:16] <[Coke]> does http://localhost:4000/builds ever self-refresh?

[15:17] <[Coke]> If not, can we have it update every (slow) interval? (like 10m or something?)

[15:17] <melezhik_> no, only /report/agent.job_$num/$num sends web socket data

[15:18] <melezhik_> "If not, can we have it update every (slow) interval? (like 10m or something?)" - doable, but requires Sparky pathc

[15:19] <melezhik_> https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/issues/62

[15:20] <melezhik_> "my goal with blin was to add all known failures to a skiplist" yep. understandable 

[15:26] <melezhik_> [Coke]: ok - here is quick fix you may apply - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/02867f9f9b1e4f03d2023928acd79e07

[15:26] <melezhik_> for auto refresh 

[15:27] <melezhik_> don't forget unset ZEF_INSTALL_TO before zef install --force-install .

[15:27] <melezhik_> all command s needs to be run INSIDE container 

[15:27] <melezhik_> refreshed every 10 seconds

[15:38] <melezhik_> [Coke]: http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/brw-reporter/1460 - all failed modules for Rakudo 2025.11 (technically not all, as round is till in progress  )

[15:38] <melezhik_> you may rerun the report yourself 

[15:38] <melezhik_> admin/admin

[15:38] <melezhik_> logs are in artifacts tab

[15:39] *** melezhik left
[15:39] <melezhik_> it's also possible to filter out only failures due to unit tests not passing ( eliminated missing decencies / etc )

[15:40] <melezhik_> for example - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/file_view/brw-reporter/ewfxmyqhtkzoacjisvgn.33/Intl::Format::Number.log

[16:05] <[Coke]> artifacts include passing tests also?

[16:06] <[Coke]> or are those all failures?

[16:06] <[Coke]> all fails on the random ones I clicked.

[18:09] <melezhik> Hm , looks like the round stuck on last modules , while pings from agents show they are busy running some jobs, I wonder what those jobs are

[18:09] <melezhik> What  modules they try to test …🤔

[18:19] <melezhik> Ok, couple of reports have just arrived

[18:27] <melezhik> Ok - another sloooooow module -  https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-web-scraper/issues/8

[18:27] <melezhik> Brownies waits currently for this one

[18:28] <melezhik> Ok, going to add it to skip list

[18:46] <[Coke]> is the skip list checked in somewhere

[18:46] <[Coke]> ?

[18:48] <[Coke]> ah, found it.

[19:00] <melezhik> 2025.10 round started.  But I think agent still got clogged with Web::Scrapper stuck jobs , probably worth to terminate them manually over UI

[19:00] <melezhik> Rather then wait for timeout

[19:09] <librasteve_> https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/12/08/2025-49-advent-is-rolling/

[19:21] <lizmat> librasteve_++

[19:29] <melezhik> Just added timeouts into agent version 0.0.50, not tested though

[19:36] <melezhik> Cache::Async failed in 2025.11 , passed in 2025.10 , but maybe this flaky ? http://brw.sparrowhub.io/file_view/brw-reporter/tepxgcforqlshazbwiuj.33/Cache::Async.log

[19:36] <melezhik> librasteve_: ++

[20:38] <librasteve_> melezhik: fancy writing an advent post?

[20:38] <[Coke]> I'd love to see that!
