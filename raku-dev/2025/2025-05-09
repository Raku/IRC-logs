[11:34] <ab5tract> nine: I'd like to pick your brain a bit about a comment you made (somewhere) about how we could generalize and automate NativeCall integration by treating all C functions as vararg-ers (I think that was what you were proposing but since I don't totally understand, I'm asking :) )

[11:35] <ab5tract> I ask becase I would love to see a Raku/Tk one day, but I don't have the patience for writing a C header parser or for adding a declaration for each Tk function

[15:07] <ab5tract> japhb: I’ve never gotten it to work properly and it is mostly abandoned

[15:08] <ab5tract> It’s much more interesting to me to unlock “automatic” natives all bindings

[15:46] <japhb> ab5tract: Took a look at the GH "network" view from that repo, looks like there are a couple forks that made additional commits, some of the "get it working" type

[15:46] <japhb> Still, understood where you're coming from.
