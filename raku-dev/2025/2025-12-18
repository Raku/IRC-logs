[12:27] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release in ≈2 days and ≈6 hours. There are no known blockers. 8 out of 44 commits logged

[12:27] <[Coke]> anyone wants to give those messages some nice text for the changelog, that'd be appreciated.

[12:28] <[Coke]> (especially for the merges that have multiple commits for the same big thing.)'

[12:35] <timo> line two belongs to the same thing as the first line, it's not really a change from one release to the next

[12:39] * lizmat will go over it shortly

[12:45] <lizmat> [Coke]: wasn't there an already post-processed version of that gist somewhere ?

[12:47] <lizmat> ah, I guess I'll just port them to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft ?

[13:05] <[Coke]> Any that can be done before the release make it go smoother, thanks1

[13:05] <[Coke]> !

[13:44] <lizmat> [Coke]: need to go afk for a few hours, will continue on the Changelog after that

[14:26] <[Coke]> Sure, any help appreciated, thanks.

[15:18] <melezhik> [Coke]: ab5tract - wish to run brownie for the head before release ?

[15:18] <melezhik> Cc patrickb

[15:19] <[Coke]> You can - I will probably not do another full blin run at this point, given that the one "real" failure has been resolved.

[15:29] <disbot6> <melezhik.> Sure

[15:29] <timo> i think we will still want to do something about vararg support "missing" from the jit before the release goes out. either nope out in the jit when we see there's varargs involved, or by implementing it correctly in the right place

[15:44] <[Coke]> timo++

[15:44] <[Coke]> would what we have at HEAD right now be a step back?

[15:44] <timo> i'm not sure if patrickb is already on it, but I think that's the case?

[15:45] <timo> no, what we have right now is better than it was days ago

[15:46] <patrickb> last months release already had the broken var-args support in it. The breakage only affects Vararg calls, so this is not really bad.

[15:47] <timo> oh, OK, i wasn't aware we already had varargs last time

[15:47] <patrickb> I do like to fix this, I've already had a quick look at spesh and jit.

[15:47] <[Coke]> Can we do it before the weekend?

[15:47] <[Coke]> I think we have enough today that a release would be nice.

[15:48] <patrickb> But given I only have an abstract idea of our jit and spesh, I believe this will take time. Not before the release

[15:48] <[Coke]> ok. so are we OK going as is?

[15:48] <patrickb> Except: If timo and I pair up. Then I guess we'd have a chance.

[15:48] <timo> ok, I'll look into it this evening

[15:49] <[Coke]> ... ok. let me know by your EOD friday.

[15:49] <[Coke]> And we can decide collectively tomorrow.

[15:49] <patrickb> timo: I don't want to force this on you, but I'd personally love to colab on this. I'd love to get to know spesh more...

[15:50] <timo> tomorrow is my last work day for the year, after that i would be free to do a session like that

[15:52] <lizmat> fwiw, I don't think 2025.11 contained varargs support

[15:52] <patrickb> That would be too late for the release. Maybe you could have a look tonight and we could maybe still do a session looking at spesh? (Please?)

[15:52] <lizmat> https://rakudo.org/post/announce-rakudo-release-2025.11 doesn't mention it

[15:54] <timo> yeah that's what i was thinking of doing

[15:54] <patrickb> agreed. then I was wrong about that.

[15:55] <patrickb> Wouldn't be that bad nonetheless, it's not breaking existing features.  But would still be nice to get it fixed before the release. But that's mostly for selfish reasons.

[15:57] <timo> making the jit bail out when it sees a var arg native call op only makes the frame in question not be jitted, so it only really has a performance impact

[15:58] <patrickb> that would be a quick fix

[15:58] <timo> quick fix is good on the day before the release ;)

[15:58] <[Coke]> +1

[17:28] <[Coke]> lizmat++!

[18:32] <timo> patrickb: do you have a good simple test library that lets you verify that a variadic call was done correctly?

[18:34] <timo> see the moarvm channel for the first stab at bailing out the jit when it sees a variadic nativecall

[19:24] <patrickb> There is t/04-nativecall/26-varargs.t (iirc)
