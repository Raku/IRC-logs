[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This commit addresses R#5652 (#5652), which noted the following

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: malfunction: using a state variable inside of a positional lookup,

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: eg. `[++$]` caused a SORRY exception related to informing the user

[11:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: of differences between Perl and Raku.

[11:27] <linkable6> R#5652 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5652 [Will be addressed in RakuAST] Can the parser for $] be made a little less agressive?

[11:51] <[Coke]> I believe the "new pull requests" section is only showing open PRs since the last week, yes?

[11:51] <[Coke]> Do we also want to show those were opened and already applied?

[12:24] <[Coke]> librasteve_: ^^ and the links to the problem-solving tickets are reversed from the order of the text (shows A B C, but they link to C B A)

[12:48] <ab5tract> [Coke]++ for the proofreading

[12:48] <ab5tract> m: role R[::T] { my package G { class A is Array[T] {}; }; method a { G::A } }; my class CStr does R[Str] { }; dd :a(CStr.a)

[12:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «:a(R::G::A[Str])␤»

[12:49] <ab5tract> nine: am I crazy or should that actually be `R[Int[G::A` ?

[12:49] <ab5tract> `R[Int]::G::A`

[12:51] <ab5tract> (sorry, switched from `Int` to `Str` when typing in the example. the difference of type is of no consequence to my question)

[12:59] <librasteve_> Coke: I chose to place the PRs in time order. Can’t guarantee that I’ll remember that every week. Please treat this as a pseudo random order with no preferential intent.

[13:04] <librasteve_> Coke: on the PRs applied vs new PRs I have been naively following the Liz’s process page on the weekly website … next week, I’ll engage my brain and try to give a better insight. Really I could use a bit more engagement to the core work to do a proper reflection of all the core (and doc) dev work … so I’ll aim to improve this. Any suggestions very welcome!

[13:13] <[Coke]> the A B C vs. C B A - the actual links are wrong - you click on A you get C

[16:58] <[Coke]> thoughts on whether we have enough commits to make a release worth it this month?

[16:59] <[Coke]> librasteve_: what's the URL to the process?

[17:03] <lizmat> I think ab5tract has made some significant fixes

[17:19] <[Coke]> excellent.

[17:20] <[Coke]> I'm on the hook for the release this month. ISTR there was a blin blocker as well (compilable was stuck) but I think we're good there now.
