[01:06] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I think it should, only if there was something like a type `SameType` and the return type of `tc` was that…

[08:46] <ab5tract> I mean, given that the result is `Any` and not `method not found`, I think it would make sense to return 42 there

[18:49] <[Coke]> onboarding with snyk - have moarvm imported, importing rakudo... I don't seem to have access (with my account) to import raku/nqp? (but there is still a perl6 org? which doesn't have nqp in it?)

[18:57] <[Coke]> any reason not to upgrade tools/build/binary-release/build-containers/Dockerfile from ubuntu:16.04 to ubunt:22.04 ?

[18:57] <[Coke]> going to try to open a PR for it, don't apply it unless it makes sense.

[18:59] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5956

[19:05] <[Coke]> That PR is auto generated from inside Snyk

[19:06] <[Coke]> Snyk found 19 code issues in rakudo.

[19:07] <[Coke]> weird. I can't seem to get a report of all issues. Looking at individual project shows me the issues. go to show all... 0 issues

[19:09] <japhb> Kinda surprised that Snyk didn't recommend 24.04.  Seems like upgrading to something 3 1/2 years old already is suboptimal

[19:11] <[Coke]> LTS?

[19:11] * [Coke] also opens https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5957 based on one of the mediums found.

[19:14] <[Coke]> any core devs who want access to Snyk org, ping me.

[19:35] <japhb> Aren't all [even].04 Ubuntu releases LTS?

[19:35] <[Coke]> no idea

[19:36] <japhb> Just checked https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/ -- looks like it is indeed [even].04

[19:38] <[Coke]> 24.04 might have more vulnerbilities?
