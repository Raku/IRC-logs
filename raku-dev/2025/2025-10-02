[05:48] <patrickb> melezhik: No progress yet. First step would be to curate a list of precise architectures we'd like to support. Then see if there are online services that allow building there.

[05:48] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to melezhik_

[15:49] <[Coke]> https://hub.docker.com/_/rakudo-star - can someone remove the "early adopter" text here that is probably 10+ years old?

[16:06] <[Coke]> ugexe - I just did a nuke to uninstall everything, forgetting that zef itself is a thing.

[16:06] <[Coke]> might be nice if the readme had a pointer to "do this but save zef" command line. :)

[16:07] <[Coke]> also, I've been writing some tests for work in raku... finally getting around to putting them into an azure pipeline so I'm not the only one that can run them.

[16:08] <[Coke]> (readme) or at least a reminder for folks that this will also nuke zef itself.

[17:08] <ugexe> it may or may not nuke zef

[17:09] <ugexe> there might be multiple zefs installed, you might be running zef from e.g. vender instead of site, etc

[17:09] <ugexe> theoretically it could probably detect if it would delete the zef that is currently running though

[17:10] <ugexe> even that could get messy though since it can load plugins in other repos i.e. zef installed to vender, plugins installed to site

[18:03] <[Coke]> Yup. probably worth just a one liner comment warning in the readme rather than a command that cn avoid all issues

[18:03] <[Coke]> Happy to submit a PR
