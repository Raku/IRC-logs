[11:46] <ab5tract> what does 'speciialization' mean in the context of the role metamodel?

[12:01] <[Coke]> bah, the vm running blin restarted 12 hours ago, lost the tmux session

[12:02] <ab5tract> [Coke] :(

[12:02] <[Coke]> ... (really need to make these runs more recoverable)

[12:03] * [Coke] kicks off another one

[13:58] *** librasteve_ left
[15:57] <[Coke]> ... went out to run errands, come back ... it's dead again

[15:57] <[Coke]> looks like the VM didn't restart, but the tmux session is gone.

[16:02] * [Coke] starts a 3rd run

[16:30] <japhb> [Coke]: Maybe worth using mosh as a workaround, since it holds onto connections better?

[16:31] <japhb> (In the future of course the project you're proposing should make that way better ... or at least less painful when it does happen.)

[16:40] <[Coke]> masterduke just merged something into moarvm, so I've killed the blin run.

[16:41] <[Coke]> .tell masterduke - if you're serious about getting that into 2025.10, please make sure we get version bumps up to rakudo. Ping me when it's done so I can restart blin. Hopefully no issues on other platforms.

[16:41] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[16:46] <lizmat> [Coke]: it wasn't MasterDuke, it was me using the Github web editor

[16:49] <[Coke]> .tell masterduke oops, nevermind!

[16:49] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[21:56] <[Coke]> blin died again, wtf.

[22:52] <coleman> Coke what is the version of the blin server? if it's a modern linux run 'cat /etc/os-release | grep PRETTY_NAME'

[22:53] <[Coke]> PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS"
