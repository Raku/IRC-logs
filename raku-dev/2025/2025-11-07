[17:53] <lizmat> ugexe: actually, not really.  as opposed to $] which has global repercussions in perl, this would only apply to *that* array

[19:06] <ugexe> the concept itself is practically a joke

[19:07] <ugexe> all of the comments from what you linked are making fun of it

[19:09] <ugexe> it doesn't even matter if it only applies to a specific array

[19:10] <ugexe> people still have to read that code

[22:06] <ab5tract> I don’t.. can’t.. what are we contemplating exactly? :)

[22:07] <ab5tract> One thing I’ve learned is that the vast majority of people trained on 0 index arrays will not listen to any counterpoints, however applicable

[22:08] <ab5tract> The only counterpoints I’ve ever heard or considered, however, were all for 1 indexed arrays

[22:10] <ab5tract> I refuse to contemplate what @a[-1..8] is supposed to mean or how it could be useful (though I guess on the second point I’m at least morbidly curious to hear what possible use cases this could ever serve)

[22:11] <ab5tract> But it would break my brain trying to imagine such use cases on my own, so that’s what I’m refusing g to do
