[10:44] <lizmat> patrickb: should show now

[10:45] <lizmat> the post lacked the "2025" category

[10:47] <lizmat> I also added a post image from the media lib

[10:55] <patrickb> lizmat: Thanks for fixing up my mess. I didn't know! Happy 4th advent!

[10:56] <lizmat> yw, am doing some "editor" work now on it....  some typos / spellos fixing

[11:03] <lizmat> hmmm..  the rendering of the markdown blocks is awful

[11:08] *** arkiuat joined
[11:12] *** arkiuat left
[11:13] <patrickb> 🙈

[11:22] <lizmat> replaced all markdown blocks and put in some headers

[11:24] <lizmat> I think it looks a good deal better now

[15:27] <[Coke]> Thanks, melezhik - it's mostly down to following directions. If someone else wants to try a release in 2026, that would be awesome. :)

[15:27] <[Coke]> (I just re-upped for my saturday morning conflict every month in 2026. :)

[20:01] <finanalyst> [Coke] are you online?

[20:51] <disbot7> <holmdunc> Looks like 2025.12 is having trouble making it into the Homebrew package manager: (libuv related) https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/259580

[20:59] *** finanalyst left
[21:03] <patrickb> Oh. I think I know what's wrong. Is homebrew using --has-libuv?

[21:09] <disbot7> <holmdunc> Yeah, they want to use Homebrew-packaged dependencies when possible - https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/3d82ffd6e6b62bbed1c3f27c491216e9b1c32802/Formula/m/moarvm.rb#L30-L32 - https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/3d82ffd6e6b62bbed1c3f27c491216e9b1c32802/Formula/m/moarvm.rb#L61-L64

[21:17] <patrickb> OK. I messed up. 😫 This will probably be a five line patch in MoarVM. But it would require a full point release. Ugh! Is there a way around that?

[21:25] <disbot7> <holmdunc> Maybe you could just post a comment on that PR asking them to comment out those Mac-specific libuv lines, along with a todo to restore those lines next time

[21:28] <patrickb> It's not mac specific. I broke --has-libuv in general. I could maybe ask them to patch in the fix commit. (TBD)

[21:31] <disbot7> <holmdunc> Ah I see

[21:42] <patrickb> I'll try to put a patch together tomorrow and get in contact with the homebrew maintainer if a one time patch is feasible.

[21:43] <timo> maybe the patch is also interesting for the debian package
