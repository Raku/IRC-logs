[13:47] <Xliff> Can someone tell me what happens when zef performs a "staging" phase?

[16:59] <tellable6> 2025-05-05T01:47:43Z #raku-dev <ugexe> finanalyst the best way to discover that would be to look at how that code works - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/b527cefcb29789120f32d5e4003913e53c47476f/src/core.c/CompUnit/RepositoryRegistry.rakumod#L309-L338

[17:07] <finanalyst> .tell ugexe is there any progress on the `Make documentation installable and accessible` grant proposal?

[17:07] <tellable6> finanalyst, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[17:10] <ugexe> no, i am not actively working on any grant proposals

[17:23] <finanalyst> ugexe: I'm thinking about working on adding a candidates-doc 

[17:24] <finanalyst> where should I add it? 

[17:28] <finanalyst> .tell ugexe does the candidates-doc method as in grant proposal only affect zef, or does it affect rakudo?

[17:28] <tellable6> finanalyst, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[17:53] <ugexe> i don't understand why we add a new method

[17:53] <tellable6> 2025-05-27T17:28:59Z #raku-dev <finanalyst> ugexe does the candidates-doc method as in grant proposal only affect zef, or does it affect rakudo?

[17:56] <ugexe> i guess that was my suggestion though wasn't it, heh

[17:57] <ugexe> it needs to be implemented anywhere `method candidates` is (at least the ones related to compunit repository)

[17:58] <ugexe> i think that would just be compunit::repository::installation and compunit::repository::Filesystem

[18:19] <finanalyst> ugexe: you did say either a method or an option, so candidates(:doc)?

[18:20] <finanalyst> would `zef` need to change? or would simply adding in doc-provides in the Meta6 be suffcient?

[19:18] <Xliff> ugexe: Is there a post-install hook I could attach to in zef?
