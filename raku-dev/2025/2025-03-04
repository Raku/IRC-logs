[11:01] <Geth> ¦ roast: If a named argument is primed with a value, then that value becomes

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ roast: the default on the primed sub's named argument.  The test did not

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ roast: account for that.  The fix that is in the works, will set the default

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ roast: in the signature.

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/7245b0b101

[11:03] <lizmat> I wonder how real life this signature is:

[11:03] <lizmat> sub capcapn (|c ($a, $b?, :$e = 'e'), |d ($c, $d?, :e($f) = 'f'), *%g)

[11:11] <lizmat> m: sub a(|c, *%a, *@a, *%b, *@b) { dd }; a     # TIL this madness is allowed ?

[17:18] <Geth> ¦ roast: The issue is really mostly about how a signature such as (:$a) is

[17:18] <Geth> ¦ roast: primed with :a (aka a => True).  In the current .assuming logic,

[17:18] <Geth> ¦ roast: the default for the argument is somewhere encoded in the EVALled
