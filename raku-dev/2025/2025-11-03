[14:39] <melezhik_> brownie another round results - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/brw-orch/1 , artifacts, interesting I did not expect so much test failures

[20:19] <timo> on the journey towards reproducible rakudo builds again, I think the problem is that we don't use sorted_keys inside RegexCaptures::!from-capnames from the bootstrap.c (and it doesn't seem like we can use it there either, it just gives a VMNull, same for &note and &say, so difficult to diagnose what's going on, too)

[20:23] <timo> i feel like i've come to this same conclusion before

[20:25] <timo> oh, two times the same hash of CORE.c.setting.moarvm in a row

[20:26] <timo> three times

[20:26] <timo> four times

[20:28] <timo> five times

[20:30] <timo> i would call this reproducible now

[20:30] <timo> but i had to copy the implementation of sorted_keys from nqp into rakudo, that's not so great

[20:31] *** melezhik left
[20:32] <lizmat> timo: on that note, do you recall the non-nqp way to HLLize an NQPArray ?

[20:35] <timo> hm, not really. doesn't just passing it to a sub or method without being careful cause it to be hllized?

[20:37] <lizmat> ah. yes

[20:37] <timo> but i guess not recursively

[20:41] <lizmat> trying to fix https://github.com/raku-community-modules/OO-Monitors/issues/18  by excluding   $!MONITR-lock   attribute

[20:41] <lizmat> in ^attributes

[20:54] <japhb> lizmat: Can a class using Method::Protected inherit from a monitor?

[20:55] <lizmat> Method::Protected uses a different attribute name, so depending on what you want to achieve:   yes or no   :-)

[20:56] <lizmat> popd

[20:56] <lizmat> meh

[20:57] *** finanalyst joined
[21:15] <timo> we could probably code-gen a method clone that handles the lock specifically and everything else normally

[21:38] *** finanalyst left
[23:56] <lizmat> yeah, that would be my next attempt

[23:57] <timo> it will probably mirror the buildallplan relatively closely
