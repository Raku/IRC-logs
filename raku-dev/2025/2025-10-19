[00:09] <[Coke]> We aren't really supporting the JVM backend at this point, correct?

[00:09] <[Coke]> It's basically listed as broken in every release announcement, and we don't run tests for it as part of the release.

[00:10] <[Coke]> We do have a half-hearted "It is also a good idea to look for JVM issues at this point."

[02:29] <timo2> the raku port of the optimizer and the original optimizer have behaviour differences :(

[08:53] <ab5tract> I think a JVM revisit would be a bit of fun, at least if it were in Kotlin

[08:54] <ab5tract> But I also have advocated for deprecating it from our outward facing materials, eg website, release announcements, etc

[10:31] <ab5tract> OTOH, my dispatcher patches were all ported to the base dispatcher, for the JVM's sake but also any future implementations too I guess

[18:20] <librasteve_> ab5tract: I think that both (working on it and removing it from public facing stuff) can coexist …

[18:34] <ugexe> wasn't ; in argument lists supposed to do something in the design docs? maybe i'm thinking of a different language though

[18:34] <ugexe> something like marking the point at which other arguments didn't affect multi dispatch or some such

[18:34] <timo2> i think it's just the regular list-of-lists syntax

[18:35] <timo2> there is also what you mean, though

[18:35] <timo2> i don't think i've ever had a need for it. could have been `::` for the syntax, or maybe it was `;`, but it's supposed to go in signatures, not in calls

[18:35] <ugexe> ah, yeah

[18:37] <timo2> so i'm writing a raku version of the nfa runner with more introspection capabilities and a way to easily go backwards and forwards and such

[18:37] <timo2> i'm hoping that will help others with understanding how NFAs work, and also help me figure out possible improvements for the optimizer
