[10:45] <jdv> [Coke]: around?

[10:47] <lizmat> [Coke] is a bit afk at the moment, should be around in a few days, I'm led to understand

[10:47] <jdv> huh, ok

[10:50] <jdv> i've decided that i don't want to release on 7/25.  so either he does on that day 100% without me or we move it - probably 7/24 or 7/31

[10:50] <jdv> that's all it is

[10:51] <lizmat> well, I don't think there's a lot to release...  perhaps even skip a release ?

[10:52] <lizmat> patrickb ^^ thoughts ?

[10:53] <jdv> sounds fine to me

[12:10] <patrickb> I share the same feeling. I think the return prioritization fix went in this month, but that can surely wait another month.

[12:59] <lizmat> hmmm.. it looks like I can't whateverable tests to work because https://whateverable.6lang.org/e87d3aa9adccf350ed5a7e04434b5718847b53ec?type=rakudo-moar&arch=darwin-arm64 doesn't produce anything

[13:01] <lizmat> possibly because there isn't anything for the darwin-arm64 architecture

[13:02] <lizmat> so I wonder: what would I need to do to create all of the rakudo versions for the darwin-arm64 architecture  (potentially locally)

[13:04] <lizmat> giving up on moving whateverable to raku-community-modules for now

[13:35] <ugexe> i'm pretty sure there are already binaries for darwin arm64 going back to like 2021

[13:36] <ugexe> https://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo 

[13:41] <ugexe> i'm not sure if you'd be able to build anything older than the 2021 releases though

[13:41] <ugexe> like i think i recall the build not working for macos arm64 until some specific point

[13:48] <lizmat> but the whateverable bots would need finer granularity than just releases, no ?

[13:58] <ugexe> im not sure if they need it or not

[14:21] <lizmat> bisectable does

[15:17] <jdv> lizmat: i think there are only linux binaries

[15:17] <jdv> can you do that on linux or can i help somehow?

[15:18] <jdv> although i'm kinda in the middle of repairing an old outboard engine so maybe "later"

[15:32] <lizmat> later  :-)
