[16:39] <ab5tract> I wonder if there is any modern build system that could handle our requirements for Rakudo

[16:50] <timo> "a bucket of shell scripts" :P

[16:57] <timo> what requirements are you thinking of in particular?

[17:15] <timo> https://harelang.org/blog/2025-06-11-hare-update/ something a friend just linked; this has a description of some tooling that lets devs write matching rules against source code of the language. probably relevant to the ast querying topic we also briefly discussed at the summit /cc patrickb, MasterDuke17

[18:15] <ab5tract> timo: I'm thinking about the abstract set of requirements that have been solved by smashing a highly specialized unicorn (NQP::Configure) into a sanity-deprivation tank (automake, or at least Makefile.in templating) and a Configure.pl on top of that

[18:17] <ab5tract> zig build seems to be quite powerful, for example

[18:19] <timo> i think part of the reasoning why we have NQP::Configure and Configure.pl is that we don't want to have more dependencies, especially no dependencies that are a pain in the arse to get on windows

[18:20] <timo> windows at least has "Shitmake"

[18:21] <timo> though i'm not sure getting perl is not a pain in the arse. at least Strawberry Perl exists and isn't so hard?

[18:34] <ab5tract> I don't know how much it's worth catering to making "build from source easier". Torture the developers and all

[18:37] <timo> you mean there's not so much benefit to this particular piece of torture?

[18:37] <ab5tract> or the torture could be redistributed from devs maintaining/altering the build setup onto the subset of devs that are actually building from source

[20:04] <[Coke]> after travelling from about 7:30 AM CEST to about 9PM EDT on tuesday, my neck doesn't hurt, but sitting isn't great. :)

[20:25] <ab5tract> [Coke]: welcome home!
