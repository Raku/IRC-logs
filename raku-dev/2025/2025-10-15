[14:41] <[Coke]> Need to consider pulling META6 into raku-community-modules.

[16:20] <timo> i thought i had written code for the moarvm/HLL/Backend.nqp to change how all the sql insert statements are written out to use a common function that handles splitting the statements up when they get too long, maybe that's still hidden in a branch somewhere
