[00:15] <[Coke]> [Inline::Perl5] .pm file extension in raku library path seen at:

[00:16] *** lizmat_ joined
[00:16] <[Coke]> so I ran "rakudo-inline-perl5" step of Ake. it succeeded. Then I ran "rakudo-stress" and the first thing it complains about is that Inline::Perl5 isn't installed

[00:19] <[Coke]> did it by hand, seems OK

[00:19] <[Coke]> running rakudo-stress step

[00:20] *** lizmat left
[00:21] <[Coke]> coleman: "ping rba or coleman or andinus" - is that list still correct?

[00:21] <coleman> where is that written 

[00:23] <coleman> For issues related to accessing the trinity.raku.org server (where the release files are hosted), it's me and andinus

[00:28] <[Coke]> it's in rakudo's docs/release_guide.pod

[00:28] <[Coke]> please wait until post release but please update that phrasing.

[00:31] <coleman> will do

[00:32] <[Coke]> (asking you in case you see anything else suss in the trinity section)

[00:32] <[Coke]> TODO passes in 6.c errata

[00:33] <[Coke]> (which I assume is fine given the nature of that branch)

[00:37] *** finanalyst left
[00:47] <jdv> todos, yeahl

[00:47] <jdv> 99% of the time actual breakage is just someone didn't port the test changes back

[00:50] <[Coke]> on rakudo-post-test step

[00:51] <[Coke]> if I'm reading this right, don't run human-upload, but cd to the nqp & rakudo dirs to push commits/tags and manually upload tarballs to trinity

[00:53] <jdv> i use human-upload

[00:53] <jdv> iirc it pushes the git changes up 

[00:53] <jdv> the "upload" part doesn't work though and times out 

[00:54] <jdv> that is the trinity scp parts

[00:55] *** lizmat joined
[00:55] <jdv> hmm, formatting error, that second scp should be on hte next line

[00:55] <jdv> i think i have that fix in my local and forgot to push it

[00:55] <[Coke]> ok. I know the scp will fail because I have no key for trinity on this box.

[01:09] <[Coke]> jdv: what is the token in tools/releaseable/github-release.p6?

[01:09] <jdv> https://moarvm.org/releases.html

[01:09] <jdv> maybe you didn't format it the same as usual?

[01:10] <jdv> oh, just a rando pers gh token

[01:10] <[Coke]> jdv - used the markdown tool; Will clean that up.

[01:12] <jdv> my token is just a "gh classic personal access token" with "repo" scope

[01:12] <jdv> there's a markdown tool?!

[01:15] <jdv> it's likely because the addition to this is different that the rest of it:  https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/docs/ChangeLog

[01:15] <[Coke]> "make sure you have text::markdown installed"...

[01:15] <[Coke]> ok.

[01:16] <[Coke]> when running github-release.p6 - same announcement file for both nqp & rakudo?

[01:16] <[Coke]> also - is "-asset" necessary or is that part of the manual fixup after?

[01:17] <jdv> i think its required to make the dumb script work

[01:17] <jdv> and it times out again

[01:18] <[Coke]>     Server responded with 404 Not Found (POST https://api.github.com/repos/raku/nqp/releases)

[01:19] <jdv> sure

[01:20] <[Coke]> (and it didn't seem to do anything to https://github.com/raku/nqp/releases)

[01:21] <jdv> how'd you call it?

[01:22] <jdv> here's how it called it last time - https://gist.github.com/jdv/fc753c72d9e23b89a74aa1e193b2b82c

[01:22] <[Coke]> sent you a privmst

[01:22] <[Coke]> hurm, no announce? ok.

[01:24] <jdv> maybe that post is because your token isn't working?

[01:24] <jdv> rather 404 on post

[01:28] <[Coke]> OK, got a 400 bad request after mucking a bit with the token...

[01:29] <[Coke]> can you tell me what permissions your token has so I don't have to add them all?

[01:29] <jdv> i did:)  i just have "repo" checked 

[01:31] <[Coke]> I have given it  admin:gpg_key, admin:org, admin:org_hook, admin:public_key, admin:repo_hook, admin:ssh_signing_key, audit_log, delete:packages, gist, notifications, project, repo, user, workflow, write:discussion, write:packages

[01:31] <[Coke]> ok, going back to just repo

[01:32] <[Coke]> jdv: Can you run the github-release for nqp & moarvm and I'll attach the files to them?

[01:33] <[Coke]> sorry

[01:33] <[Coke]> for nqp & rakudo

[01:33] <jdv> moarvm is done already, the ci auto thingee replaced it but that's what i ran...yeah

[01:33] <jdv> i think you did nqp already

[01:33] <[Coke]> @#($*&?

[01:33] <jdv> not rakudo yet

[01:33] <jdv> idk

[01:34] <[Coke]> so one of these runs worked, but I keep seeing 400/404s?

[01:34] <[Coke]> freaky

[01:35] <[Coke]> added the files to the nqp release.

[01:35] <[Coke]> OH. I wonder if the 400 was the asset upload error, and that's why the error went from 404 to 400 after the first call

[01:36] <jdv> sounds close enough

[01:36] <jdv> weird your .asc file is smaller than mine 

[01:36] <jdv> maybe your key is smaller or something

[01:36] <[Coke]> weird.

[01:37] <[Coke]> releases created, files attached

[01:39] <jdv> just realized the rakudo tar is 6.66MB

[01:41] <[Coke]> 2 releases running, at least.

[01:41] <[Coke]> I thought you were telling me it was BIG, not that it was a fun number.

[01:45] <[Coke]> how long does it take for rakudo.org to restart?

[01:45] <[Coke]> (I pushed the commit but don't see it on the news page)

[01:45] <[Coke]> (after doing the ssh restart step)

[01:47] <jdv> uh, the ssh command is the restart

[01:47] <[Coke]> I think we're done?

[01:47] <jdv> like immediately

[01:47] <jdv> just the moarvm formatting is all i know 

[01:49] <jdv> hmm, did you push the stuff to rakudo.org and restart?

[01:49] <[Coke]> https://rakudo.org/post/announce-rakudo-release-2025.01

[01:50] <[Coke]> Yes, I missed a colon.

[01:50] <[Coke]> fixed.

[01:50] <[Coke]> I have a page of handwritten notes to update the guide and/or open bugs

[01:51] <[Coke]> which is a job for tomorrow.

[01:51] <jdv> i had that page for years and just merged it into the guide recently:)

[01:51] <[Coke]> the more people we get to do releases, the better the guide will be!

[01:51] <jdv> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/main/docs/ChangeLog and http://www.moarvm.org/releases.html are still not right

[01:52] <jdv> i'm not sure who will do next month's release yet.  maybe patrickb or you or me...

[01:53] <[Coke]> Right, I did the formatting based on cutting and pasting something, which screwed that up. Not worth re-releasing, but worth fixing.

[01:53] <[Coke]> I put Coke|jdv on the "next".

[17:52] <[Coke]> lizmat: No, it was fine, no worries.

[17:54] <lizmat> what box where you trying on before that?

[17:55] <[Coke]> my mac

[17:55] <[Coke]> worked great until "make the actual tarball"

[17:55] <lizmat> ah, so we can't do a release from a Mac ?

[17:56] <[Coke]> at which point, the perl script (why are we using perl for a critical part of our release infra?) barfed on locale settings, and getting around those, the tar command is using a LOT of what I'm guessing are gnu specific args

[17:56] <[Coke]> lizmat: correct. Looks fixable, though.

[17:56] <[Coke]> Just not in the pressure of doing a release.

[17:57] <lizmat> ack... and why perl: I do not know, seems also fixable  :-)

[20:17] <timo> oh

[20:18] <timo> lizmat: can you give me a shout before you merge the next of my pull requests so i can check if it should be a draft pr instead?

[20:18] <lizmat> will do

[20:19] <lizmat> I thought it was ready (enough) and had been sitting there for a while now

[20:19] <lizmat> #1883 ??

[20:20] <lizmat> also #1882 will appreciate some TLC from you  :-)

[20:20] <timo> well, the CI is red on that merge request

[20:20] <timo> needs to be re-run because the logs have been purged

[20:21] <lizmat> re-runs requested

[20:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Bump NQP to get debugserver loaded file notifications

[20:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[20:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Timo++

[20:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/af3b5a6524

[20:23] <[Coke]> Q: how do the individual NQP bumps help?

[20:23] <[Coke]> individual CI runs?

[20:23] <timo> for bisecting

[20:24] <[Coke]> +1

[20:25] <timo> theoretically, we could build stuff into the bisect bots / scripts that goes into NQP versions when the issue happens to hit a bump commit

[20:32] <lizmat> hmmm..looks like the REA harvester dies on HEAD now  :-(

[20:34] <timo> i don't think i saw the branch with the arm fix be merged?

[20:34] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5606 - this like a DIHWIDT - theyre trying to use utf8 on something that isn't necessarily

[20:34] <lizmat> timo: which one is that ?

[20:35] <timo> i think it doesn't have a pull request maybe

[20:35] <lizmat> there's no PR for it?

[20:35] <lizmat> nuking ~/.raku/precomp fixed the problem

[20:39] <timo> there is now a PR

[20:40] <lizmat> thanks, will merge later today or tomorrow, after CI is complete

[20:40] <timo> the problem that the PR is fixing is nondeterministic

[20:42] <timo> bumping revisions makes the CI very dumb

[20:43] <lizmat> ok, so you're saying I should ignore CI in this case ?

[20:43] <lizmat> or that I shouldn't be bumping so much ?

[20:43] <timo> neither

[20:43] <timo> we need to do something that makes the CI not turn beet red whenever there is multiple bumps in a row

[20:44] <timo> we might be able to grab the exact commits for the three repos at the very start of pipelining, even before any of the builds start? like, in a separate stage even

[20:44] <lizmat> that would be nice  :-)

[21:05] <[Coke]> huh. if I search for issues like >>  is:issue state:open -label:jvm -label:"Will be addressed in RakuAST" -label:"Fixed in RakuAST" <<

[21:05] <[Coke]> I still get the will be addressed labels in the search

[21:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Attempted to be smart about it initially, but these all failed

[21:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: because you can not reliably clone an iterator and its internal

[22:00] *** finanalyst left
[23:06] <[Coke]> where would [max] be in core?

[23:09] <timo> that should just be METAOP_REDUCE applied to &infix:<max>

[23:09] *** sena_kun left
[23:14] <[Coke]> m: max [^100000000]

[23:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 997ca6a46: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤MoarVM panic: Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 235446976 bytes␤»

[23:15] <[Coke]> wondering if we can make that old ticket work, but we'd probably have to special case on ranges *and* the function.

[23:18] <timo> well when you shove ^10000000 into an array by using the [] constructor syntax, you are actually asking it to create an array with one entry for all these numbers in that range

[23:19] <[Coke]> right. I'm wondering if there's a way to skip the array creation there in special cases; guessing this is just something we should document as a trap (it already kind of is) and close out the ticket.

[23:19] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1210

[23:35] <timo> not sure if it'd be possible to special-case-handle `max [^bignum]` except when it's very literally that

[23:36] <timo> i imagine, most cases the array would have to be created and filled long before we even realize it was only being fed into max or min

[23:37] <timo> and if we make that literal case work and someone refactors that code ever so slightly, the optimization breaks and suddenly your program will consume huge amounts of memory

[23:43] <[Coke]> so let's just close that ticket out.

[23:56] <timo> well, the ticket is about more than just that?
