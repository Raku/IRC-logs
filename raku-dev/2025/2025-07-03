[16:44] <lizmat> ugexe: is it correct that we cannot ask for the keys in %?RESOURCES

[16:44] <lizmat> or am I missing something ?

[17:21] <ugexe> i don't think there is anything wrong with an api for knowing what resources are available. as far as why is .keys not implemented on it, probably the same reason every other method a hash can do hasn't yet been implemented on it: it would be tedious and most of the methods aren't practically useful

[17:22] <ugexe> technically $?DISTRIBUTION.meta<resources> works for this though

[17:22] <lizmat> aahh!   good enough for me  :-)

[19:53] <lizmat> No output received, exit-code -16 (38):

[19:53] <lizmat> Failed to spawn process zef.bat: no such file or directory (error code -4058)

[19:53] <lizmat> patrickb: ^^ just saw this on a Windows CI job

[19:54] <lizmat> the test program adds .bat for Windows to do a "zef.bat install ." 

[19:54] <lizmat> should the .bat be removed nowadays ?

[19:55] <[Coke]> I think so

[19:55] <[Coke]> the cleverness is in the wrapper now, I think

[20:01] <lizmat> indeed... cool

[21:01] <patrickb> The executable still has an extension, .exe now. It puzzles me a bit, that .bat should not be automatically extended, while .exe would.

[21:01] <patrickb> But if it works, I'm all fine. :-)
