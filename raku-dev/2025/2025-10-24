[09:05] <melezhik_> if someone wish to participate in experimental brownie Demo, there is link - https://github.com/melezhik/brownie/tree/main/agent , I am looking for someone would run docker container on their laptop for a few minites/hours to test Blin to Sparky migration 

[09:05] <melezhik_> this is demo server controlled by me, and it's safe to add your agents to this demo pool 

[09:06] <melezhik_>  this is the list of modules  for test under Brownie (aka Blin2.0) - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/32b5ae39a1b059b9095605c5a3229c33

[09:07] <melezhik_> results are visible on http://brw.sparrowhub.io

[09:07] <melezhik_> I need more build agents to test against longer lists of modules

[09:08] <melezhik_> here is how your agent would look like once you run it on your laptop - http://agent.sparrowhub.io

[09:08] <melezhik_> agent would wait jobs from http://brw.sparrowhub.io and start execute them once new job requests arrive, basically running zef install Foo things

[09:09] <melezhik_> this is how distributed tests for Blin20 could look like

[09:09] <melezhik_> brownie - is just a code name for a new version of Blin20, maybe I'll change, I am free for suggestions ))

[09:11] <melezhik_> ping me whenever you add your agent so I can track if it's listed in registry ... you can also see your agent yourself  registered on http://brw.sparrowhub.io 

[09:12] <melezhik_> it will help if you name your agent specifically according to https://github.com/melezhik/brownie/tree/main/agent#faq , so we can tell your agents from others, if name is not set, random agent-bla-bla-bla name is assigned
