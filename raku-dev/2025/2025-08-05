[14:07] <jdv> what is this "forgejo" stuff?  just skimming it feels like another Trac type thing.

[14:10] <jdv> found it - https://trac.edgewall.org/ - wow, blast from the past - specifically catalyst

[15:07] <timo> forgejo is a "forge" which you can imagine to mean "github clone", and "another trac type thing" is relatively fitting
