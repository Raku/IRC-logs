[09:41] <lizmat> inspired by a discussion on #raku-beginner:

[09:42] <lizmat> m: dd Uni.new(65,96).Str   # this feels it should have been À  ??

[09:45] <lizmat> ah, no, combining, so:

[09:45] <lizmat> m: dd Uni.new(65,0x300).Str   # phew

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: update all files in "bin" directory

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This would allow a "kaas" executable for Dutch localizations (instead

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: of the most decidedly uncool "nedku"), and a "wurst" executable for

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: German localizations (adding to the uncool "deuku").

[14:41] <patrickb> lizmat: I think I don't like "Wurst". That word is slightly negatively connotated. Connotations I feel are: stupid, simple minded, unfaithful. If you want to go for a typical German food, things that come to mind are "Bretzel", "Strudel", "Stollen", "Lebkuchen"

[16:07] <lizmat> hmmm...I like strudel

[16:08] <[Coke]> I ALSO LIKE STRUDEL

[16:42] <japhb> "I can't believe you like money^Wstrudel too!  We should hang out."

[17:04] <lizmat> strudel also fits in more with the "denata"  patrickb++ for the nudge!

[19:14] <timo> strudel is already A Thing: https://strudel.cc/

[19:15] <lizmat> timo: do you think that's going to be a conflict, other than the name ?

[19:16] <timo> probably not an actual problem
