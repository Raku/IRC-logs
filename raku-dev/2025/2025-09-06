[17:51] <coleman> docs site prototype is here https://dev.docs.raku.org/type/UInt

[17:51] <coleman> I am ready to cut over at any time

[18:08] <japhb> coleman: Under thriving-ecosystem I see this: say 42m / 10s;   # 42m/s

[18:08] <japhb> Missing decimal point in answer, methinks.  :-)

[18:10] <coleman> Brnchname is "dev" for raku.org (patches go here) https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/tree/dev

[18:11] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/blob/dev/lib/Org/Home.rakumod#L181

[18:22] <japhb> Why is the dev branch 19 commits ahead of main, but the last change there was 2 weeks ago and the site went live today?  Is it intentional that this branch is currently unmerged?

[18:22] <coleman> It is intentional. But it can be merged to main now. I will open a PR.

[18:23] <coleman> The deploy is containers, so the build can come from anywhere. right now it comes from dev.

[18:28] <japhb> Ah, gotcha

[18:40] <japhb> I like that front page.
