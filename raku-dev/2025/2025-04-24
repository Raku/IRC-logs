[07:15] <patrickb> I don't have access to my remote computer in the next 5 weeks or so. Thus I won't be able to sign the compiled release archives.

[07:16] <patrickb> jdv, [Coke]: On the next release, may I ask you to sign the release files, I upload to the server?

[07:17] <patrickb> One of you suffices.
