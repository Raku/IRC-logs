[12:27] <disbot7> <dr.shuppet> Oh you are already aware about the breakage, I just opened an issue for it because it failed for us in T2 Linux

[12:27] *** arkiuat joined
[12:28] <disbot7> <dr.shuppet> We have automation for hotfixes that can patch it for the single release and that will auto-remove it when unneeded, just publish the patch

[12:35] <patrickb> Cool! I hope to do so in about 7 hours.

[12:35] <patrickb> Thanks everyone for being so flexible!

[12:44] <lizmat> patrickb: looking at t/04-nativecall/26-varargs.t

[12:45] <lizmat> is there a reason each of the subs there needs to take 0 as the first argument?   Couldn't you just have "sub foo(**@varargs) is native { * }"  ??

[13:13] <patrickb> it's a C requirement that you have at least one non variadic leading arg. That makes sense, because in order to use he variadic args in the callee, one needs to pass the address of that leading non variadic arg.

[13:14] <patrickb> lizmat: thanks for jumping in and doing the communication!

[13:14] <lizmat> patrickb: ok, so why not hide that?

[13:15] <lizmat> ah, I guess you can actually add meaning to that argument if you want to

[13:17] <patrickb> a good example is printf, which has that leading arg be the format string.

[13:17] <patrickb> or Ioctl where the first arg is an enum that specifies the meaning of the variadic args.

[14:35] <patrickb> printf doesn't return a str

[14:35] <patrickb> otherwise I'd expect that to work.

[14:35] <patrickb> probably returns int32

[14:38] <lizmat> yup, you're right.  I guess I was thing sprintf  :-(

[15:06] <lizmat> seems so

[15:09] <patrickb> \o/

[15:09] <lizmat> sprintf not so  :-(

[15:09] <lizmat> m: use NativeCall; sub sprintf(str, **@ --> str) is native {*};  say sprintf "%d", 42

[15:28] <patrickb> I think sprintf also works differently. still returns int32 and takes a first Str arg - a buffer and a size Iirc

[15:29] <lizmat> aah, could be... 

[15:29] <patrickb> https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sprintf/

[15:30] <patrickb> So snprintf is what one would want to use

[15:38] <lizmat> meh

[15:38] <lizmat> ah well..

[15:47] <patrickb> snprintf takes a buff size as second arg

[15:47] <patrickb> https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/snprintf/

[15:51] <lizmat> I think I'll just use printf as an example in the review  :-)

[19:19] <patrickb> I've now posted on the homebrew issue.

[19:19] <patrickb> I'm unsure how to reach the debian guys...
