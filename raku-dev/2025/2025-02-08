[11:11] <lizmat> that's better  :-)

[12:54] <jdv> why not run rak locally.  i don't get it.

[12:55] <lizmat> you can as well

[12:55] <jdv> is it just for the in chan collab?

[12:55] <timo> useful for 1) sharing your results immediately and 2) collaborating with others

[12:56] <timo> also, no need to download the whole REA to your own machine. and if you're like, on your smartphone and just had a quick idea on the loo or on the train, you can log in to webirc

[12:56] <jdv> ok, so i'm not missing something like its going over multiple versions or something more than just a local run with in chan results

[12:56] <jdv> cool

[12:57] <lizmat> fwiw, it's *not* going over multiple versions, only the most recent ones

[12:57] <timo> yeah i think that searches in the latest version for every name/auth combination

[12:57] <lizmat> the ones you would get if you'd do an install

[12:57] <lizmat> without specifying a version

[12:57] <timo> possibly name/auth/api

[12:57] <lizmat> also: the REA only has gzipped tar files

[12:58] <timo> can rak go into archives if you want it to?

[13:03] <lizmat> not at the moment

[13:03] *** guifa joined
[13:04] <lizmat> still looking for a module that would do just that in a way that would be compatible with App::Rak / rak

[13:05] <lizmat> wrt to the "recent modules logic": https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Ecosystem::Cache
