[09:03] <ab5tract> [Coke]: ah, ok. Are you setting any resource constraints?

[09:04] <ab5tract> Random hard crashes are probably a bit of a blocker for wider adoption :)

[09:05] <ab5tract> So I’m still on the lookout to see what can be done to fix that, short of running one of the “mini kubernetes” options

[09:37] <ab5tract> I also experienced a hard crashes in Windows last night, not running brownie. So I can’t rule out some instability in the machine itself. But the fact that you had the same on yet another OS is helpful information to know.

[10:14] <disbot6> <melezhik.> [Coke]: do you relate the crash to brownie agent run ?

[13:39] <[Coke]> Who said I had crashes?

[13:39] <[Coke]> OH ME

[13:40] <[Coke]> the mac m2 lap crashes regularly, nothing to do with brownie.

[13:40] <[Coke]> sorry for the confusion
