[09:54] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[09:54] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset

[09:54] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2025-05-19T09:54:52Z”

[10:01] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/05/19/2025-20-less-is-mini/

[10:13] <nine> Xliff: you need to run with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 if you want to use BEGIN time calls

[10:39] *** librasteve_ left
[11:40] <lizmat> nine: building with the RakuAST bootstrap is: perl Configure.pl --gen-moar; RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 make

[11:40] <lizmat> right ?

[11:41] <nine> right

[11:41] <lizmat> hmmm.. I guess my interning fixes broke the bootstrap then...  looking

[11:46] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe the nqp::stringify is to blame

[11:47] <lizmat> although it is documented as "Coerce an object to str."

[11:47] <lizmat> which would include Int ?

[11:48] <lizmat> meh: Method 'Str' not found for invocant of class 'Int'

[11:48] <lizmat> too early in bootstrap I guess

[12:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/bootstrap-rakuast: 47 commits pushed by 12 authors

[12:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/bootstrap-rakuast: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/compare/938b218196df...699f18473015

[12:33] <lizmat> bootstrap is clean again

[12:33] <lizmat> well, builds again

[12:39] <nine> lizmat: I'd just like to point out that the commit message really doesn't say much about the reason for the commit. Which is all the more surprising because you did write down that reason on IRC. Copy and pasting those messages would already have been enough.

[12:40] <nine> That's actually what I do quite often for more complicated commit messages. I tend to post my findings to IRC anyway, so I just take those, reword them a bit and commit the result.

[12:40] <lizmat> understood, will try to do better next time

[12:41] <lizmat> nine: the message;  Out-of-sync package detected in LANG1 at se::L10N::$slang;

[12:41] <lizmat> RakuAST::Dep

[12:41] <lizmat>   (value in braid: RakuAST::Class, value in $*PACKAGE: RakuAST::Class)

[12:41] <lizmat> is expected to be seen in the bootstrap building, or is this a new artefact?

[12:42] <nine> If you ever find out why this happens or even fix it, please notify me. I have made several attempts, but still no clue. Only that we seem to do fine despite this error.

[12:43] <lizmat> right

[12:43] <lizmat> the golfed .assuming bug on precomp, exists in the same way on the bootstrap it seems

[12:43] <lizmat> Could not find a compile-time-value for lexical Nil

[12:44] <lizmat> also: make test / spectest are not supposed to be clean on the bootstrap, right nine?

[12:45] <nine> Locally I have added some debug output for that message even:

[12:45] <nine> Out-of-sync package detected in LANG1 at se::L10N::$slang;

[12:45] <nine> RakuAST::Dep (value in braid 2196159632: RakuAST::Class Map, value in $*PACKAGE: RakuAST::Class RakuAST::Deparse)   at NQP::src/core/IO.nqp:297  (/home/nine/rakudo/install/share/nqp/lib/NQPCORE.setting.moarvm:)

[12:45] <nine> IIRC make test was clean when I left it. Spectests are still awaiting fixes by vrurg
