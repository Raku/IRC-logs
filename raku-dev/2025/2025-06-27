[13:39] <jdv> need to gen the changelogs in a bit.  releases'll start in maybe a couple hours.

[13:43] <[Coke]> jdv++

[13:43] <[Coke]> I have a few hours of hackathon time today, will be poking at blin and maybe some releng tickets.

[15:12] * [Coke] waves from the greenville "hackathon"

[15:13] * lizmat waves back

[15:19] * [Coke] trips over bruce, makoto, ruth, geoff, zeke? and some others.

[15:19] * [Coke] also finds out his drone doesn't work great inside. :)

[15:19] <lizmat> careful with Bruce!   he's pretty fragile!

[15:19] <[Coke]> jdv: how goes?

[15:19] <[Coke]> (fragile) awwww.

[15:40] <[Coke]> but I will for sure do the lightning talk at least.

[15:40] <lizmat> meh... :-(

[15:46] <[Coke]> He was going to do an RSC talk - liz, did he discuss that with the RSC previously?

[15:46] <[Coke]> Just wonder if the topics are out there.

[16:41] <jdv> it's still on my todo list.  i'll update stuff when i can do it again of course.

[16:42] <[Coke]> yah, no rush. I honestly feel better that you're working with a snapshot right now so any changes I make at HEAD won't impact you

[16:43] <[Coke]> and when you cutover, we can make sure it still works for you.

[16:43] <jdv> [Coke]: when i went to school we used 2 spaces.  i still do.  i forgot "they" changed it "recently"

[16:43] <jdv> back in the dark ages i might add when we learned on ibm selectic things

[17:51] <jdv> does cpantesters run over backpan?

[18:21] <[Coke]> (doing an "essentials" run now)

[18:22] <jdv> was that bed bath and beyond's house brand?

[18:22] <jdv> my favorite was foodtown's "No Frills"

[18:41] <[Coke]> Doing an "essentials" run (only 173 modules total) and I see it's bisecting PDF.

[18:43] <jdv> not a great time.  release is imminent.

[18:44] <[Coke]> You would have seen any blin issues with PDF on the full run, I'm sure

[18:44] <jdv> I did and liz addressed them

[18:44] <[Coke]> please don't worry about my one off here on a blin branch

[18:44] <jdv> It worked last time i tried it

[18:44] <[Coke]> I'm probably running bad endpoints. :)

[18:44] <jdv> okie

[18:46] <[Coke]> .tell masterduke17 great to see you at the RCS

[18:46] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[18:49] <jdv> hmm, looks like zef reports failure on head but the failures look like todos to me

[18:58] <[Coke]> blin runs would be faster if modules just passed everywhere. :)

[19:02] <[Coke]> going to put together a proposal for saving Blin run data in a web app, which will cover several of the proposals in the blin repo

[19:02] <jdv> where is everywhere?  on mac you mean?

[19:03] <[Coke]> jdv: instead of failing both at HEAD and at the last revision which then makes us run two tests when we probably already know they both will fail.

[19:03] <[Coke]> we're doing double the work for the same "fail" answer. (and then we ignore it because "it was already failing")

[19:03] <[Coke]> if it passes at head... spend half the time testing

[19:03] <jdv> right

[19:05] <[Coke]> uhoh: "CPAN Testers is currently running in a degraded state"

[19:05] <[Coke]> regarding REA: I don't think we should include it in the main blin runs.

[19:06] <[Coke]> I'll open a ticket for people to comment on if they like.

[19:06] <jdv> i think cpan testers has been that way for months sadly

[19:06] <jdv> lizmat: around?

[19:06] <lizmat> yes

[19:06] <jdv> did PDF test clean for you?

[19:07] <jdv> it does seem like its still broken
