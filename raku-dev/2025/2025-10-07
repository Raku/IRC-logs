[14:18] <[Coke]> maybe the build box is out of disk or something. :(

[20:07] <ab5tract> [Tux]: is Rakudo really only ~2x as slow as the Perl stack? :O

[20:07] <ab5tract> also, why is test-t-20 way more than 20x slower than test-t?

[20:08] <ab5tract> nine: when you get a moment, I'd love to hear any thoughts you have on R#5970

[20:09] <ab5tract> I'm not clear on whether I need to be mucking around in RakuAST::Role or in RakuAST::Type::Parameterized

[20:11] <ab5tract> [Coke]: disk space could explain why the bot didn't create a link to R#5970

[20:11] <ab5tract> if a full disk has caused any failure cascades

[22:46] <japhb> ab5tract: I'd be surprised if out-of-disk *didn't* cause a failure cascade.  That's the kind of thing that like a dozen people worldwide ever *actually* test ....

[22:48] <japhb> One of the teams I was on in the past used to test against disks 95% full, and even that was easily enough to cause problems to start.  I'm pretty sure 100% full would have just caused the datacenter to give up and disconnect itself in protest.
