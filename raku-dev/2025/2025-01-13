[18:33] <lizmat> so that feels correct ?

[19:29] <[Coke]> oh, that *is* a weekend.

[19:29] <[Coke]> we had talked about the 19th or the week after, and the math in my head wasn't adding up. Thank you. :)

[20:17] <jdv> probably cause both us were looking at the wrong months and/or years when we were figuring it...

[20:17] <[Coke]> :)

[20:17] <jdv> *date* math

[20:51] <[Coke]> if we have two weeks, what are the odds of getting the REPL_PROMPT work into this release?

[21:24] <jdv> no big changes in the last week though so really only 1

[21:26] <jdv> unless you want to blin forever and deal with last minute stuff.  if your doing it then sure:)

[21:28] <[Coke]> I do not, sir. :)

[21:29] * [Coke] ponders kicking off a blin run.

[21:29] * [Coke] thinks he'll wait for the last week - did one the first week and caught something.
