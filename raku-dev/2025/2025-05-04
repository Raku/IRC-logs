[07:43] <ab5tract> Nice suggestion!

[07:44] <ab5tract> One thing I’m finding tricky is setting up $?DISTRIBUTION in the rakutest file

[07:44] <ab5tract> So I hardcoded it for now

[10:27] <finanalyst> .tell ugexe is there a way to discover which distribution/location `CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.run-script("run-locally")` is pointing at? I moved the script run-locally when I spun a Cro related script into a new distribution, but now I cant get rid of the old one.

[10:27] <tellable6> finanalyst, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[10:34] <finanalyst> .tell ugexe fwiw the 'child' distribution had a lower version number than the 'parent', so by bumping the child to a version in excess of the 'parent', the new version of the script is now run.

[10:34] <tellable6> finanalyst, I'll pass your message to ugexe
