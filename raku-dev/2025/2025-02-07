[10:51] <lizmat> hmmm.  seem to be unable to find where the code lives that greppable6 uses to post gists ?

[10:51] <lizmat> [Coke] ^^  any idea ?

[13:26] <[Coke]> not off the top, would have to dig. I know just enough to trigger a bot rebuild/reconnect at the moment.

[13:26] <[Coke]> I can look after $dayjob today.

[13:26] <lizmat> ok, thanks, I'll do some more digging later today

[13:26] <lizmat> testing rakkable now on #bottest

[21:05] <rakkable> lizmat, Rakking on #raku-dev with Raku module IRC::Client::Plugin::Rakkable 0.0.1

[21:05] <rakkable> lizmat, Currently supported: all | provides | tests | scripts query [rak args]

[21:05] <lizmat> note that ^^ is still pretty alpha

[21:06] <lizmat> it allows searching *all* of the recent modules in the raku ecosystem, by either files in "provides" sections, test files, scripts

[21:06] <lizmat> or all of the above with "all"

[21:08] <rakkable> lizmat, That was all!

[21:09] <leont> Wait what did I do now?

[21:09] <lizmat> the Getopt::Subcommands module is the only one with the "unfrobnicate" string in it in the ecosystem

[21:10] <timo> ohai leont :)

[21:10] <lizmat> rakkable (for now) is a more uptodate version of greppable6 

[21:11] <lizmat> but I intend to add more things to search in, such as the core settting, and all of the rakudoc
