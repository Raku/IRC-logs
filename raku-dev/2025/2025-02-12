[22:17] <[Coke]> Kicking off Blin run.

[22:22] <[Coke]> Touch – MissingDependency – Dependency “v6” was not resolved

[22:26] <[Coke]> I don't see that as a dep on Touch (i do see NativeHelpers::CStruct which isn't on raku.land)

[22:26] <[Coke]> (but is available to install via zef?)

[22:27] <ugexe> what distribution is giving that error?

[22:27] <ugexe> v6 is a pragma

[22:28] <[Coke]> that line is from the blin output when it's deciding what's testable.

[22:30] <[Coke]> zef info is showing v 0.7.0, but the repo is 0.7.3 with no tags

[22:32] <[Coke]> looking at a commit in the repo that contains 0.7.0, I don't see a bad entry under version in the META

[22:34] <ugexe> its declaring v6 as a dependency. that is wrong

[22:34] <ugexe> arguably zef could just ignore v6.* names. but its a pragma not a module/distribution so depending on it doesnt make sense

[22:36] <[Coke]> Yes, but I can't find why it thinks it depends on that.

[22:37] <ugexe> it is in the META6.json data

[22:37] <[Coke]> oh, zef itself sees that. 

[22:37] <ugexe> zef look Touch then run nano META6.json

[22:38] <[Coke]> ok. that's not in the REPO today, they just need to cut another release. Danke

[22:39] <jdv> skip list it!

[22:40] <[Coke]> https://github.com/0rir/touch/issues/1

[22:40] <[Coke]> Or, they can fix it. :)
