[08:55] <melezhik> Hi!

[08:59] <melezhik> coleman: on - https://github.com/Raku/infra/issues/112#event-20037794876 I still contemplating idea of using Spraky as a front end for all configurations management tasks , instead of cli interaction via tomtit, especially if we are going providing end user the tool as container . What do you think ? In my taste current solution we have currently in configuration-management/ folder a bit clumsy mixing calling sparrowdo via 

[08:59] <melezhik> tomtit , we can get rid of this complexity given we use sparky instead running as docker / podman container , what do you think ?

[09:01] <melezhik> I can create an example of such a file   while working in  this ticket …

[09:01] <melezhik> file -> flow

[11:38] <lizmat> I guess it's short for coercion

[15:28] * [Coke] had to add https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/coke/rakudo-star-ssl/general to make his pipeline issue work. opened a ticket on rakudo/docker to hopefully address it in future.
