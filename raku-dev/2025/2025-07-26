[15:04] <lizmat> heh, looks like we don't "encode" the "api" value of a dist in the name of the tar file (at least App::Mi6 doesn't)

[15:04] <lizmat> since we are supposedly allowed to have the same version but different API, this means we have a conflict in the tar file in such a situation

[15:04] <lizmat> which would affect the REA  :-(

[18:41] <[Coke]> Oof
