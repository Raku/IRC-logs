[17:00] <ab5tract> lizmat: bummer :(

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: cfaee8a094 | ab5tract++ | src/Perl6/Metamodel/ParametricRoleHOW.nqp

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Revert "Add an istype check on the role group"

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This reverts commit 0a90592a5eebc3d19d23062f3b40018757baf74b.

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This apparently broke ecosystem modules, a la Hash::Ordered.

[17:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cfaee8a094

[17:03] <ab5tract> ^^ lizmat: one has to wonder whether ecosystem modules that rely on behavior absent from roast tests are fair bellweathers

[17:04] <ab5tract> I mean, that's kind of the whole point of blin/brownie, but still

[17:05] <ab5tract> frustrating how waterbeddy everything is sometimes

[17:12] <[Coke]> One of the possible results of ecosystem failures is opening tickets on the module telling them they're doing it wrong.

[18:04] <lizmat> ab5tract: thanks for the revert, but maybe a bit premature:  sure, it fixed Hash::Ordered's problem, but I just didn't have time to investigate what the exact problem was...

[18:04] <lizmat> will do so probably tomorrow
