[19:46] <[Coke]> first blin run: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5764

[19:48] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8f38af87cd8dcb54bfbbbd012f5d5c3e46c219ea was one of the breaking commits.

[19:49] <lizmat> meh

[19:51] <lizmat> MoarVM panic: Internal error: zeroed target thread ID in

[19:51] <lizmat> that hardly seems related to that commit, unless it's reproducible

[19:51] <lizmat> in which case... whee!

[19:52] <[Coke]> it runs failure a few times to avoid flappers, I think?

[19:52] <[Coke]> I can always rerun just the failures...

[19:52] <lizmat> could you at least for Cro::FCGI ?

[19:58] <[Coke]> sure!

[20:25] <[Coke]> couldn't find the failure again - did 2 runs just in case.

[20:26] <lizmat> yeah, looked like one of the gremlins that live in the precomp times
