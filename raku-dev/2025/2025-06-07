[09:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This reverts commit 617906054237bf1fe891f963a08d044c51e4c956.

[09:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The commit was merged accidentally and it breaks compilation with the

[09:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: old compiler frontend.

[09:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3dad1a55ae

[09:04] <[Coke]> jdv: that was an early merge of some rakuast stuff. The one reversion should mean we're OK for next release to not break anything, checking now

[09:40] <[Coke]> coleman: we should consider using the same new build for doc-website for the examples site.

[09:41] <[Coke]> (and then we can treat examples like raku/doc as just content source)

[09:41] <[Coke]> (and start standardizing)

[11:22] <nine> The incompatible change most likely to cause ecosystem fallout is that Perl6::Metamodel::* is no longer available. It should always just have been Metamodel::*

[19:15] <[Coke]> is there a way I can tell zef is runnigng my tests?

[19:16] <japhb> Are you wanting to know *from within the test* whether it is zef calling, or are you wanting to know *as the user of zef* whether your tests are being run correctly?

[19:17] <[Coke]> from within the test. The functionaity in some cases is doing a git ls-files, which of course fails when you have a tarball that isn't a repo

[19:17] <japhb> Ah gotcha.

[19:18] <japhb> Without touching the process tables, I don't know offhand, but I knew the clarification would be important for whomever could answer.  :-)

[19:19] <nine> Why not just check if there's a .git directory and maybe if it's actually one containing your code?

[19:19] <[Coke]> I will probaby skip those tests for now unless some env var is set. (like for NETWORK_TESTING)

[19:19] <[Coke]> ... or if no .git dir present, yes.

[19:46] <[Coke]> https://raku.land/zef:coke/RakuDoc::Test::Files is showing 0.3, but zef can't find it

[19:47] <[Coke]> (missing a zef update, bad timing)

[22:13] <timo> i'm getting closer to a reproducible core.c.setting, i can feel it

[22:14] <timo> (currently by throwing elements out without regard for what they were doing)

[22:26] <japhb> .oO( It turns out the empty buffer is very reproducible! )

[22:41] <timo> lizmat: Breakpoint on SETTING::src/core.c/allomorphs.rakumod:338 hit by thread 1!  /  1 Block <anon>       SETTING::src/core.c/core_prologue.rakumod:79

[22:41] <timo> it is indeed where we run val on environment variables going into our %*ENV hash
