[09:36] <ab5tract> timo: if it's still in a branch, let's get it merged after this release is pressed

[09:36] <ab5tract> Then we can ship it in time for Christmas, hopefully with a few other goodies

[11:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: don't show signature on regex/rule/token

[11:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: If no actual parameters are specified, which is the most common case

[11:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/483307f7c8

[12:34] <ab5tract> still so confused about CurriedRoleHOWs .. why don't they have a body_block? is the curried_role always a ParametricRoleGroupHOW? why aren't CurriedRoleHOWs designed to do all of the things (body_block, signatured) required to $group.add_possibility?

[12:39] <ab5tract> why doesn't the body_block live on the role group instead of the (when is it used?) ParametricRoleHOW?

[16:17] <timo2> i have a relatively simple program with multiple worker start blocks and the thread pool scheduler keeps adding more and more worker threads because it thinks there may be a deadlock because per-core utilization is too low :|

[16:20] <timo2> meanwhile, usage of the rakudo process goes up above 1k%

[16:30] <timo2> actually i might have done something wrong

[16:31] <timo2> yeah i absolutely did something wrong :)

[17:58] <lizmat> make sure that each batch in the start block does sufficient processing  :)

[18:03] *** [Coke] left
[18:42] <timo2> the start blocks are for the lifetime of the program, not for individual tasks

[19:01] <lizmat> why not just do a Thread.run then?

[19:03] <timo2> yeah i guess i could

[19:48] <jdv> lizmat: what's the usual dance you do to rename stuff in git?

[19:48] <lizmat> git mv

[19:48] <jdv> i thought i've seen multiple commit setups

[19:48] <lizmat> or if it's many file:

[19:49] <lizmat> rak --rename-file '*.subst(".t",".rakutest")' t

[19:49] <lizmat> to rename all files in the t directory to their new raku extensions

[19:49] <lizmat> --rename-files

[19:50] <jdv> there's something where you've done a double move but i can't find it

[19:50] <lizmat> ??  what you mean with a double move?

[19:51] *** camelia joined
[19:52] <jdv> i just remember something odd from a few times doing the changelogs and i became curious cause i'm about ot move a bunch of stuff in a rando personal repo

[19:55] <lizmat> sorry, I haz no idea

[19:56] <lizmat> rak will rename with `git mv' if it sees the file is under git control

[19:56] <lizmat> otherwise it will just do a rename

[20:00] *** camelia left
[20:01] <jdv> i guess i was just remembering stuff like this:  git log --stat e42457^..75370b

[20:02] <jdv> no idea why.  happy thursday.
