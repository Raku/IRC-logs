[17:26] <tonyo> [Coke]: are you using the new client?

[17:33] <ugexe> it'd probably be useful in the future if the client UA was sent and recorded

[18:56] <[Coke]> tonyo: haven't published anything recently, will use the new one when I do

[18:57] <lizmat> tonyo: is this the newest / greatest version?

[18:57] <lizmat> % fez version  

[18:57] <lizmat> >>= fez version: 55

[19:15] <tonyo> that is latest published

[19:15] <tonyo> next version is 100 because it's breaking

[19:34] * [Coke] is not a fan of the "What is Perl 6 (Raku)" video.

[19:35] <[Coke]> I am not a fan of the "What is Perl 6 (Raku)" video.

[19:35] <[Coke]> didn't get past the first 30s or so, lots of perl, sounds like automated voiceover.

[19:45] <[Coke]> (and the looped video)

[19:45] <lizmat> yeah  :-(

[19:49] <timo> ah shit, AI slop once again?

[19:52] <lizmat> do we have a way to see if an attribute will build from the Attribute object?

[19:52] <lizmat> m: class A { has $!a is built }; dd A.^attributes>>.name   # checkin the twigil is not an option

[19:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar f52cc9284: OUTPUT: «("\$!a",)␤»
