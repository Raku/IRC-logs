[11:35] <lizmat> m: my token v { a }; say "a" ~~ / <v> /   # works, but I don't want v captured

[11:36] <lizmat> m: my token v { a }; say "a" ~~ / <.v> /

[11:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 633df2893: OUTPUT: «No such method 'v' for invocant of type 'Match'.  Did you mean 'kv'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:36] <lizmat> bisectable6: old=2020.01 my token v { a }; say "a" ~~ / <.v> /

[11:36] <bisectable6> lizmat, Bisecting by output (old=2020.01 new=633df28) because on both starting points the exit code is 1

[11:36] <lizmat> meh

[11:36] <lizmat> apparently always been that way

[11:36] <lizmat> weird

[11:56] <timo> m: my token v { a }; say "a" ~~ / <.&v> /

[11:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 633df2893: OUTPUT: «｢a｣␤»

[11:57] <timo> i guess <v> is short for <&v> if it's not a method of your cursor class, but <.v> doesn't check that?

[11:59] <lizmat> ah... indeed  ... hmmm

[12:02] <timo> sounds sensible for the semantics of <v> and <.v> to match up
