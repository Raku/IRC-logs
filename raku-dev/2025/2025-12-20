[13:11] <lizmat> yw, and thanks for reporting

[13:12] <lizmat> fwiw, that bug must have been there since at least Feb 2020

[13:12] <lizmat> I guess not a lot of people use one()

[13:13] *** arkiuat joined
[13:13] <arkiuat> at least not for definedness tests. That is a rather particular use-case, I guess

[13:14] <arkiuat> I guess this means I can go ahead and close that issue I opened then?

[13:17] <lizmat> nah, I'll do that    didn't even realize there was an issue    just went by the backscroll late last night

[16:24] <[Coke]> doing the moarvm build have status that includes:

[16:24] <[Coke]>         modified:   3rdparty/libuv (new commits)

[16:25] <[Coke]> correct way to say "just give me what is recommend for that submodule" ?

[16:25] <[Coke]> (I made no changes to that folder directly. if I go in to the folder, i get

[16:25] <[Coke]> HEAD detached at 8fb9cb9

[16:26] <timo> that means the repo inside has something different checked out from what the outer repo has committed

[16:26] <timo> does the command that "git status" outputs above the "modified: ..." section help?

[16:28] <[Coke]> I ended up doing https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/537893/git-status-with-submodule-shows-new-commits

[16:29] <[Coke]> (git diff in moarvm reo, show the old commit it was using, go to 3rdparty/libuv, git checkout that commit)

[16:29] <[Coke]> Now all is blissfully silent again.

[16:29] <[Coke]> I assume there's a "git submodule" command I can use to do the same thing

[16:38] <timo> [Coke]: is there a section that the azure pipeline thing could go, maybe "CI" or something?

[16:38] <timo> in moarvm's changes

[16:41] *** finanalyst joined
[16:42] <patrickb> I fundamentally failed to fix up the libuv submodule after I changed the upstream repo. (I tried many different submodule commands). I ended up deleting the submodule dir *and* submodule cache dir and reinitialized from scratch. That worked.

[16:45] <[Coke]> timo: your timing on changelog update questions is historially "just missed the window"

[16:46] <timo> damn :)

[16:46] <[Coke]> timo: I put it under "Core" which I have been treating as the catchall

[16:46] <timo> the thing about submodules is that you're supposed to use the regular git commands and pretend the submodule is just a single file

[16:46] <timo> so add, reset, stuff like that

[16:46] <[Coke]> ... and it never works. :)

[16:47] <[Coke]> I never touch 3rdparty stuff. and whenever someone *else* does, my checkout gets fubar'd.

[16:47] <[Coke]> 75% of the time, I just throw away my clone and get a new one once 3rdparty shows up in the status. just didn't want to do that with the release clone.

[16:48] <timo> you have the additional constraint that in order for your commit of the outer repo to actually be usable to others, the inner repo must be not just committed but also pushed to the same thing other people have cloned there as well

[16:48] <timo> but yeah i agree that it's a total pain

[16:49] <[Coke]> ok. MoarVM release complete. slight break before picking up the nqp/rakudo releases.

[17:00] <[Coke]> back

[17:17] <[Coke]> spec test running on master...

[17:32] <[Coke]> looks like some issues on the errata branch, I believe these already mentioned post-unicode 17 merge but never fixed:

[17:33] <[Coke]> t/spec/S15-nfg/GraphemeBreakTest.t                          (Wstat: 768 (exited 3) Tests: 1943 Failed: 3) Failed tests:  749-751

[17:33] <[Coke]> ^^ 6.c

[17:33] <[Coke]> Someone please open a ticket about that. I won't make it a release blocker, but we need a ticket to track until it's clean

[17:42] <[Coke]> some TODO passing in both 6c and 6d, but IIRC, that's fine.

[17:45] <[Coke]> Yup. same failure on 6.d for the s15-nfg test

[17:45] <[Coke]> can someone who isn't a core dev please open a ticket for that on roast? (and or just fix the errata branches?)

[18:07] <[Coke]> patrickb, el_che - should be OK to start binary releases.

[18:11] <[Coke]> Release is done.

[18:11] <[Coke]> Please squawk about any issues. I managed to avoid the one I made last time about putting the releases in the wrong dir.

[18:12] <[Coke]> Thanks to all the devs/docs/site updates everyone made this month, this was a pretty substantial release, esp. in MoarVM!

[18:12] <arkiuat> teensy tiny one: in line 52 of docs/ChangeLog, might want to change 2025 to 2026 in the phrase "Upcoming releases in 2025 will include"

[18:12] <arkiuat> also thanks and yay!

[18:26] <[Coke]> oops.
