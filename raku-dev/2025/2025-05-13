[06:11] * ab5tract is confused... running `make spectest` with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 is giving me a more than a handful of failing spectests ...

[06:43] <nine> more than 3?

[07:19] <ab5tract> yeah..

[07:20] <ab5tract> let me recompile base and see what's what

[07:24] <ab5tract> okay, that looks *much* better

[07:25] <ab5tract> I guess adding these worries affects a lot more test output than anticipated...

[07:28] <ab5tract> `generics.t`, `is-type.t`, and `nominalizable.t` <--- these would be the expected three, righT

[07:28] <ab5tract> ?

[07:45] <ab5tract> now that looks much better (it was insufficient guarding around $param.type actually existing)

[11:41] <[Coke]> ok, I thought the blin run aborted somehow... but I think it was just clean?

[11:42] <[Coke]> output/overview was updated, but not output/failures.md

[11:43] <lizmat> heh...  :-)

[15:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈3 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[15:57] <[Coke]> releasable6: next

[15:57] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release in ≈4 days and ≈3 hours. There are no known blockers. 13 out of 13 commits logged

[15:57] <[Coke]> Be nice if the timed one included the 13 out of 13.

[15:58] <[Coke]> . o O (He said, in a note to himself)

[16:36] <nine> ab5tract: right

[17:31] <ab5tract> hmm, would it be a nice addition to NQP to have an `neaddr` to complement `eqaddr`?

[17:32] <ab5tract> as we often have negated checks

[17:33] <ab5tract> wj

[17:33] <ab5tract> unless helps, _unless_ you want additional branches

[17:39] <nine> I don't think we use it all that often. And sometimes we use it when it's not actually necessary like in ^^^

[17:39] <nine> Also NQP does have =:=
