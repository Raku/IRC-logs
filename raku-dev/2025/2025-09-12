[09:06] <lizmat> patrickb: does it have to be ASCII ?

[09:07] <lizmat> I guess the "typeable" part is an indication of that

[14:38] <japhb> lizmat: "typeable" gains a lot of breadth if you have a compose key, or can assume one

[14:46] <[Coke]> "improbable" or "currently not compilable"?

[14:47] <greppable6> [Coke], and I oop! Backtrace: https://gist.github.com/c3573e4ab5c10366a2e43b16e3154b89

[14:47] <[Coke]> ... that seems bad.

[15:08] <patrickb> In an IDE I'd like to be able to send commands to the language server by embedding those commands into the source

[15:08] <patrickb>  they are auto deleted once performed. But I have to make sure valid source code never looks like those commands.

[15:09] <patrickb> Otherwise the lang server might delete parts of the source.

[15:11] <patrickb> I currently tend to only allow these commands on a separate line. That should simplify the matter a bit. 

[15:36] <[Coke]> Are you auto-inserting them?

[15:37] <[Coke]> special oneline comment format?

[20:31] <patrickb> Coke: It's commands the IDE user would type to communicate with the lang server. Once the command is received the lang server would confirm and remove it automatically again. So they are   transient.

[20:33] <patrickb> In general I don't plan to work an any of this in the foreseeable future, but I can't stop my brain from thinking about it.

[22:55] <japhb> I would in general caution against in-band signaling in the protocol.  Having a keyboard shortcut for the client UI is totally reasonable, but having the language server try to separate escapes out of the stream is just asking for trouble.  :-P

[23:19] <patrickb> Yeah I know it's pretty, uhm, unconventional trying to do in band communication. But the LSP is pretty narrow in what one can do. AFAIK there is no generic communication mechanism built in.

[23:19] <patrickb> I'm open for other ideas. This is just the best I've come up with so far...
