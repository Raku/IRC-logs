[00:48] <[Coke]> 🥞🥞🥞 Bisecting P5tie

[00:58] <[Coke]> ... but the bisect I mentioned earlier didn't happy yet in this run?

[01:08] <[Coke]> ok, managed to keep the tmux session open this time until:

[01:08] <[Coke]> 🥞🥞🥞 Testing Pod::Literate (new)

[01:08] <[Coke]> Terminated

[01:12] <[Coke]> wonder if I have to scale up the machine again. :(

[01:25] <japhb> How big is the instance now?

[01:42] <[Coke]> Standard_F8s_v2 - 8 vcpu, 16Gib Ram

[01:44] <[Coke]> sadly, I boxed myself in so I cannot go higher on the current setup (next is 16 vcpu, 32gib, but I can't do it with the machine I have setup because I picked the gen2 VM setup, not gen1, and you can't swap it once you've done it. so I'd have to resetup the box as opposed to just resizing it in place.

[01:46] <[Coke]> well, nothing more tonight, anyway. jdv - if you can do the blin run, that'd be great, but no worries if not, I'll see what I can do.

[02:13] <jdv> [Coke]: when?  im boating.  i can monday.

[02:25] <[Coke]> release is next weekend. I'll try again tomorrow, will report back
