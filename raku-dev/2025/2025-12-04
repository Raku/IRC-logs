[02:12] <[Coke]> which appears to have been a typo that was corrected. Can we remove that name from the ecosystem?

[05:54] <melezhik> Yes. Need to remove it from eco system and add to skip list

[05:55] <melezhik> The round took 2 hours and 25 minutes to certain

[05:55] <melezhik> To be certain

[10:25] <melezhik_> how can I remove distribution from eco system? Should I use fez for that?

[10:26] <melezhik_> I'd like ti remove 'SparrowCI - super fun and flexible CI system with many programming languages support' distribution 

[10:27] <lizmat> you can only remove "new" distributions (which have been uploaded less than 24 hours ago)

[10:27] <lizmat> although that feature appears to be broken atm     tonyo ugexe

[14:00] <ab5tract> it can't be correct that I had to add the `$first //= @i[$idx]`, can it?

[14:01] <ab5tract> ie, could there really be  a genuine situation where max returns Any as the value but with a valid key?

[14:02] *** melezhik joined
[14:02] <melezhik> I see

[14:02] <melezhik> [Coke]: could you please upgrade the agent to the latest version ? Thanks

[14:03] <ab5tract> melezhik: I can add some to this run

[14:03] <melezhik> ?

[14:03] <ab5tract> I can run some agents

[14:07] <melezhik> Ah, great 👍

[14:07] <melezhik> Please upgrade to the latest version

[14:07] <melezhik> Thanks

[14:07] <ab5tract> sure thing :)

[14:08] <ab5tract> lizmat: ^^ (sorry for finding this)

[14:08] <ab5tract> *this bug

[14:30] <[Coke]> melezhik: upgraded.

[14:31] <[Coke]> (sorry, I let the laptop sleep overnight)

[14:34] <melezhik> [Coke]: thanks , there used to be still one stale job running , could you please terminate it ?

[14:36] <melezhik> No worries

[14:36] <[Coke]> melezhik: that's the "[SparrowCI - super fun and flexible CI system with many programming languages support]" distro

[14:37] <melezhik> patrickb: if you are going to run your agent , please upgrade it too , thanks .  Have made some changes , so want to make it sure all the agents has the same version

[14:40] <melezhik> “5:36 PM <[Coke]> melezhik: that's the "[SparrowCI - super fun and flexible CI system with many programming languages support]" distro” yeah . I don’t know why it hangs , but I already added it to skip list , you can just terminate it

[14:42] <patrickb> melezhik Do you think it would be technically possible to implement an auto update functionality? I.e. that the agent listens for a ping from your end, shuts down updates and boots up again?

[14:42] <melezhik> It’s possible .

[14:43] <melezhik> I think I can do something in the next version

[14:44] <[Coke]> I think it would be helpful if we had a way to delete items in the fez (any) ecosystem that were a) obvious mistakes b) malware

[14:45] <[Coke]> I would be fine if this required something manual like opening a ticket and having a small set of admins who can approve/reject the request.

[14:46] <melezhik> Agree

[14:47] <melezhik> Run another round of 2000 modules against Rakudo 2025.11

[14:47] <melezhik> Added some meta information for every module which is tested

[14:49] <melezhik> For example

[14:49] <melezhik> add module 6pm ... OK, status: FAIL, agent: cokebot-27928036, check_method: direct, parent: not set

[14:49] <melezhik> check method is how module has been checked

[14:51] <melezhik> It’s one of two 1) direct ( zef install Foo ) - direct installation 2) testfail/testok - indirect , as a dependency of Foo

[14:52] <melezhik> Parent - is not null if module has been tested as a dependency for “parent” module

[14:54] <melezhik> Also there is “testfail” flag ( not shown in this example ) that if it’s False means the reason of failure of module test is not passing unit tests , which is probably most interesting case as we look for situation when/if Rakudo breaks module unit tests

[14:59] <[Coke]> might be nice to have a timer check - if the tests take longer than... 30m? kill them, mark that as a new status.

[15:03] <melezhik> Yeah , that’s possible as well. From other hand this now reveals such a problematic modules . I think termination on deadline and sending back to o10r timeout signal for further analytics

[15:04] <melezhik> Another example of meta information “add module MIME::Base64 ... OK, status: OK, agent: distracted-hopper-96388688, check_method: testok, parent: Cro::WebApp::Evaluate”

[15:58] * ab5tract has to remember that kv forms no longer have ((k1,v1),...) semantics

[15:58] <ab5tract> it's only been a decade ;)

[15:59] <timo> time to Parcel these memories away

[16:26] <melezhik> [Coke]: could you please upgrade agent agents? Hit weird bug with caching file content in Rakudo

[16:26] <melezhik> Agents -> again

[16:29] <[Coke]> Done

[16:32] <lizmat> ab5tract: can you repro a case where .max produces Any ?

[16:33] <lizmat> I can't seem to

[16:33] <melezhik> [Coke]: thanks

[16:40] <ab5tract> lizmat yeah sorry about that, I was just clarfying a moment ago that I was holding it wrong

[16:41] <lizmat> okidoki  :-)

[16:41] <ab5tract> I was calling .max(:kv).first

[16:41] <ab5tract> expecting ($k,$v), but only getting ($k)

[16:42] <lizmat> ah, the Parcel confusion

[17:10] * [Coke] kicks off a blin run

[17:17] <ShimmerFairy> Right as I was going to sleep, I'll merge the roast updates too unless someone's already doing that.

[17:17] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: I didn't see a PR for roast ?

[17:18] <ShimmerFairy> sorry, I didn't submit a PR, I just pushed a branch. My fault for not making it clearer.

[17:20] <lizmat> ok, leaving it up to you then  :-)

[17:21] <Geth> ¦ roast/master: 1c6e195161 | Update Unicode docs and scripts.

[17:21] <Geth> ¦ roast/master: f2b5b16c8a | Update collation test todos.

[17:21] <Geth> ¦ roast/master: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/compare/99806613ef6d...bc75048227a3

[17:22] <ShimmerFairy> There, now people can run the new tests on the new code. Again, apologies for making that a bit more hidden, I'm just glad I happened to check the chat one final time before zzz.

[17:23] <[Coke]> Do those tests need to be updated on 6.c/6.d ?

[17:23] <[Coke]> (don't want any surprises december release)

[17:24] <ShimmerFairy> Not sure what that means, I just had to update the tests that check MoarVM for its Unicode support.

[17:25] <[Coke]> There are branche specifically for 6.c and 6.d - master is for "latest"

[17:25] <[Coke]> so if the 6.c or d roast tests will now fail on rakudo master, that's an issue.

[17:26] <ShimmerFairy> Yeah, that'll be an issue. Whatever normally has to be done when things are updated. (I'm guessing the 6.c/6.d branches didn't exist when the docs/unicode-generated-test.asciidoc was written?)

[17:28] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/language/faq#What_is_the_Raku_specification?

[17:28] <[Coke]> it's not specific to unicode, it's just a generic roast issue.

[17:29] <[Coke]> no worries, worst case will need a cherry pick probably

[17:31] <ShimmerFairy> Luckily Unicode likes its stability, so it shouldn't be too big a disruption. The grapheme rule updates ought to be backwards-compatible (though they may not be, especially if they tested any Indic script graphemes), and over the past few versions there were some changes made to DUCET that could possibly cause collation test failures, not sure though.

[17:57] <japhb> ShimmerFairy++  # Thanks for driving this to completion!
