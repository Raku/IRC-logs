[06:57] <disbot6> <melezhik.> [Coke]: I guess you stopped agent at some point yesterday , but the test looks good, reports from agent were coming steadily and tests worked correctly. I guess we hit a case when one job stuck , so I suppose you either terminated it  or it finally went through , anyways we can think about sort of timeouts on agents side for jobs which is absolutely possible from sparky perspective

[15:54] <melezhik> Ok. 2000 modules for Rakudo 2025.11 brownie report - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/file/brw-orch/dbmpuvyxaclihgfjqzos.33/summary.txt

[15:54] <melezhik> 0 sec timing means modules were installed as dependencies so can’t measure time

[15:58] <melezhik> Rakudo::Perl6::Format 50663 sec looks weird but probably some stuck job finally made it, I don’t know

[16:56] <melezhik> Or maybe docker container slept for awhile and the started that resulted in such a long time

[16:57] <[Coke]> I'm on a laptop, so that could happen (but my laptop rebooted due to a problem earlier, didn't auto-restart any docker stuff)

[18:08] *** melezhik_ joined
[18:10] <melezhik_> yeah, no worries , imho timing does not makes a sense at all bearing distributed natures of tests on brownie, as it depends on randomness of agent state at the time a module is installed ( e.g. how many decencies of a module are already installed ?)

[18:11] <[Coke]> is the job server smart enough to send out a job that wasn't returned by agent 1 to another agent?

[18:14] <melezhik_> yes, it's already so

[18:16] <melezhik_> actually I call this mixing, 010r sends random that have not been reported from agents to across all agents in random lists

[18:16] <melezhik_> sends random -> sends modules 

[18:18] <melezhik_> also if agent does not report it status after 6 minutes it is taken out of rotation

[18:18] <melezhik_> so modules are distributed only to active ( aka online ) agents

[18:19] <melezhik_> to across all agents  -> to one of online agents 

[18:22] <melezhik_> [Coke]: I guess I am ready to say that brownie is production ready, at least I hopefully fixed all important bug in it , it'd be interesting to run 2000 modules against rakudo 2025.10 and then run compare report, and see if we get any discrepancies , after all this is what brownie/blin is for ...

[18:31] *** melezhik_ left
[18:35] <[Coke]> Yup, let's give it a try for this release (I'll also run blin)

[18:35] <[Coke]> (er, for 2025.12) - we can also re-run against a previous one for comparisons, etc.

[18:51] <disbot6> <melezhik.> 👍
