[08:07] <nine> bartolin: I see no comment on that commit

[08:17] <bartolin> Hmm, for me there are small icons on the right side of lines 174 and 176. By clicking on the icon they can be expanded. I had hoped they would be more visible for you. Is there a better way to add a comment to a commit? (I'm not that familiar with the features of GitHub.)

[08:18] <bartolin> Ah, these could be direct links: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c0c4e7addb#r152716887 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c0c4e7addb#r152717048

[17:44] <timo> not to open yet another meta file discussion, but should we specify the "supports" stuff a bit more? a distinction between "this url can be fed directly into a version control tool's CLI" and "this url can be opened in a browser for a web view of the repository" would be the first thing i can think of immediately
