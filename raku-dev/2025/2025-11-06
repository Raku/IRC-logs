[11:11] <timo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5762 anyone want to look deeper into this?

[11:20] <lizmat> it's way down on my list

[11:42] <timo> i am in awe of your list

[11:53] <lizmat> heh

[13:13] <lizmat> finally spotted the flapper in Pod::To::HTML:

[13:13] <lizmat> m: for ^5 { my %h = a => 42, b => 666; say %h.head }

[13:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «a => 42␤a => 42␤b => 666␤b => 666␤a => 42␤»

[13:14] <lizmat> newer versions of Template::Mustache will attempt to call a sub/method if it looks like it can

[13:16] <lizmat> instead of just returning the field in the hash

[13:24] <timo> aah

[13:25] <lizmat> and Pod::To::HTML testing used a "head" field    changing that name fixed the testing issue

[13:28] <timo> was it an intentional change in Mustache? is there a note about this change in behaviour in the change log etc?

[13:31] <lizmat> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Template-Mustache/commit/92c8af322877615a23e98a658f46b8c44e7d2e87#diff-5352e553d1577a660725e86753cbf139c59588ebc3a88e4402281e14261dcd97R431

[13:31] <lizmat> thing is, commit was done "after" the last non-community release

[13:32] <lizmat> and am now starting to wonder whether to revert that

[13:33] <timo> it may be a good idea to exclude methods that come from Any or Cool or something for this logic

[13:33] <timo> mustache in other languages probably has no syntax for differentiating between method call and attribute access?

[13:33] <lizmat> nah, thinking more about this, this feels like a 

[13:33] <lizmat> an attack vector

[13:33] <timo> hehe. {{ lmao.EVAL }}

[13:34] <timo> or something like {{ blah.fail }}, plenty of fun methods to try at least for causing some chaos and confusion

[13:35] <lizmat> yes, indeed

[13:35] <timo> it also occurs to me that since this uses can instead of something with cando, and doesn't try with a fallback, any method that requires arguments would be found and called, and immediately die

[13:36] <lizmat> that also

[13:36] <lizmat> so I think I'm going to remove that feature

[13:36] <timo> it does prioritize a hash key over a method call at least

[13:37] <timo> but i'm also not sure if it makes sense to call this an attack vector, don't mustache templates allow arbitrary code in stuff like "if" already?

[13:39] <lizmat> I think the issue is that it's using .defined, rather than :exists

[13:40] <lizmat> if an element exists in the hash, it should take that value, regardless of whether it's defined or not?

[13:41] <timo> i don't know how mustache handles undefined values (or rather, how users expect it to behave)

[13:41] * lizmat neither    the only reason I look at it, is because it's a deep dependency of Pod::To::Markdown

[13:45] <timo> fair
