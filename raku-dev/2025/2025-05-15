[17:36] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/60803faef7

[17:37] <lizmat> the other day, librasteve mentioned that one day they'd make App::Crag a slang

[17:37] <lizmat> and I got to wonder that it should be pretty easy

[17:40] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/645ff290dc92a729a345410872f88b91

[17:40] <lizmat> shows that idea, but alas it doesn't work

[17:42] <lizmat> however, I don't see anything wrong with the logic

[17:43] <lizmat> as far as I can see, the define_slang *is* run with the correct $LANG setting

[17:43] <lizmat> what am I missing ?

[17:47] <[Coke]> nested slangs OK?

[17:48] <lizmat> afaics it's not nested

[17:48] <lizmat> the nesting is in the EXPORT sub exporting an EXPORT sub

[17:49] <lizmat> which is what Slangify is based on

[18:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/enhance-named-param-subset-feedback: Favor =:= over ! nqp::iseq()

[18:55] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/enhance-named-param-subset-feedback: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/412872e0a3

[19:05] <lizmat> I guess it boils down to:

[19:05] <lizmat> put this in a Foo.rakumod:  BEGIN my $ = $*LANG;

[19:06] <lizmat> then load it with -MFoo

[19:06] <lizmat> and get: Missing serialize REPR function for REPR MVMContext (BOOTContext)

[20:00] <nine> That may be caused by an exception object getting serialized

[21:30] <timo> could be $*LANG stores a Failure there if it's not found at that point

[22:21] <lizmat> the $*LANG is valid there, *not* a Failure

[22:24] <lizmat> hmmm... it appears to work ok in RakuAST...

[22:26] <lizmat> ok, that looks like progress...  that needs a night of sleep :-)
