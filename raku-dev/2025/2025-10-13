[17:47] <[Coke]> jdv: couldn't get it working, if you can throw the output in a gist, I can open the ticket, etc.

[17:57] <librasteve_> notable6: weekly

[17:57] <tellable6> librasteve_, I'll pass your message to notable6

[17:57] <librasteve_> hmmm

[18:00] <jdv> i'll start it now.  might be done before midnight if all goes relatively normally...

[18:05] <jdv> [Coke]: ^

[18:15] <librasteve_> https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/10/13/2025-41-tchotchke/

[18:21] <[Coke]> Thanks, man. I owe you another beer.

[18:22] <[Coke]> I also want to convert blin to be resumable, and/or to make it a client/server app instead of a "run once for hours and hope it doesn't crash" app.

[18:23] <[Coke]> I suspect that timeline is closer to "early next year". But it would be nice to be able to have other devs contribute to testing runs in a way that requires little manual coordination

[21:57] <japhb> [Coke]: One possible in-between point is to have on-disk work queues, with tasks moving between directories from "waiting" to "working" to "done".  That way you don't have to worry about the client/server aspect, or doing DB work, or creating a web interface, or anything like that.

[21:58] <japhb> Just turn blin into a worker that starts up, recovers from previous failure by checking if there is anything in "working" *AND* no currently running blin and moving all such entries back to "waiting".

[21:59] <japhb> From then operation is basically: 1. Move task from waiting to working.  2. Do the needful.  3. When finished, move the task to done.

[22:00] <japhb> Retrying something is basically moving it from done to waiting; starting a run is basically deleting done and refilling waiting.

[22:01] <japhb> Then you can write a little script that tells you the status of the queues, and summarizes the results (wherever those were put), and you're golden.

[22:03] <japhb> (Citation: I did exactly this 20 years ago to an existing system that was falling apart and needed immediate resuscitation before anything more advanced could be written to replace it.)

[22:11] <japhb> I should have said "starting a run is basically EMPTYING done and refilling waiting" above.  (If you're taking advantage of atomic rename in the filesystem, you don't want to break that atomicity by needing to recreate directories.)

[22:53] <jdv> its just the tuits.  blin and its deps are not the easiest things to work with and only 2 people, used to be 1, use it really;

[22:53] <jdv> i have no time for that but welcome any change in that direction

[22:54] <jdv> [Coke]: i think you already owe me some beers and we just were at a bar and iirc i paid for all my beer:)

[22:55] <jdv> its still chugging.  1/2 way done, by count at least.

[22:55] <jdv> module count i mean
