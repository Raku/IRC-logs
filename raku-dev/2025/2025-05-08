[16:17] <ab5tract> nine: we seem to be going through a moment of distros changing their packaging standards en masse

[16:18] <ab5tract> What worked 8 years ago clearly wasn’t up to Debian standards or else timo++ wouldn’t have had to go through a hell or two to keep us available

[16:19] *** finanalyst left
[16:19] <ab5tract> timo: I think DB::SQLite already provides such a pool

[16:25] <nine> ab5tract: but what changed?

[16:28] <ab5tract> This requirement for reproducible builds seems to have come from nowhere, to be honest

[16:29] <ab5tract> But now you can’t stay in without it

[16:29] <nine> No, it really hasn't. It's somewhere between 5 and 10 years old. Can't say more precisely without checking

[16:29] <nine> Where do you think I got the term "reproducible builds" from?

[16:30] <lizmat> fwiw, I think the fact that we do not have reproducible builds yet (apparently), is still a development issue as well (for me at least)

[16:30] <ab5tract> I never noticed you using it, so…

[16:30] <nine> Well the test file is called t/02-rakudo/reproducible-builds.t :)

[16:30] <ab5tract> All I know is that I never saw a ticket about reproducible builds until last year

[16:31] <ab5tract> So then what has changed is that it went from soft to hard requirement

[16:31] <ab5tract> That’s all that has changed, afaik

[16:31] <nine> If it's a hard requirement, then there's no immediately applicable solution.

[16:32] <nine> Because there are bugs that make our build non-reproducible.

[16:33] <ab5tract> But maybe there is something collateral fallout for distros related to that crazy supply chain hack attempt from last year

[16:33] <nine> * One may get around that for packaged module files by just not precompiling them at all, but the same bugs affect rakudo itself

[16:33] <ab5tract> The xz one

[16:36] <ab5tract> Hmmm, that’s interesting. I know timo worked very hard on keeping us (rakudo) in the repos. I had assumed he had fully  addressed the issue. But since you are saying that this isn’t actually possible, I realize I don’t have a clear picture on what work needed to be done to satisfy the distro folks

[16:37] <ab5tract> But for sure things have changed in a bunch of distros in what felt like overnight

[16:55] <ab5tract> nine: I understand your position about the yyjson patch. I want to gauge the veracity of your opposition before I add the same for the JVM

[17:12] <nine> I'm not gonna rage quit over that :D

[17:28] <ab5tract> Ok :)

[17:29] <ab5tract> I do agree in principle though. It would obviously be preferable if we could speed up the whole runtime instead of the is sort of special casing via libraries
