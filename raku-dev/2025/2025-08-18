[18:18] <patrickb> [Coke]: <tellable6> 2025-07-01T17:56:07Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> alexdaniel - can you commit on the plan to move whateverable to fez instead of the old "listing of github repos" ?

[18:23] <[Coke]> Ah, yes, that was the work liz was doing before I got a dog, and we had to move it back, I think

[18:23] <[Coke]> Sounds like he was cool with whatever, though. Thanks, patrickb

[18:36] <[Coke]> (and AlexDaniel)
