[01:29] <[Coke]> oof. azure costs this month for blin & release are going to be higher than usual. I need to consider getting a linux box to do this stuff on at home.

[12:13] <nine> OMG finally t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.t is done!

[12:13] <nine> 1333

[12:13] <JimmyZhuo> that's a lot of work!

[12:15] <nine> 68 (!) separate fixes for that one file

[12:16] <JimmyZhuo> m: 

[12:16] <JimmyZhuo> m: 'use attributes :U; class { has Int:U $.a = Str }.new

[12:17] <JimmyZhuo> 'use attributes :U;', looks likes it's useless now.

[12:24] <Xliff_> nine: 4 more spec tests for greatness!

[12:24] <nine> hah!

[12:24] <Xliff_> :)

[12:32] <nine> Oh no....no....no, NO!

[12:33] <nine> There is a t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc2.t

[12:33] <nine> # You failed 69 tests of 265

[12:38] <lizmat> looks like an issue in throws-like?

[12:39] <lizmat> maybe not:

[12:39] <lizmat> what => "Variable"   instead of   what => "attribute"

[12:45] <nine> Nah, it's just a lot of details to get right

[12:45] <nine> That one's likely because attributes are also just VarDeclaration::Simple

[13:00] <[Coke]> Looks like Jimmy's commit was also rakuast.

[13:02] <JimmyZhuo> yeah

[13:03] <lizmat> argh... sorry [Coke]: should have paid attention when I merged it

[13:16] <[Coke]> no worries for me -  Much easier when processing the commits as we go instead of at month end.

[13:16] <[Coke]> releasable6: next

[13:16] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release in ≈17 days and ≈5 hours. 1 blocker. 133 out of 133 commits logged

[13:19] <[Coke]> that on page load. clicking edit does nothing

[13:20] <finanalyst> [Coke] Thanks. looking again

[13:21] <[Coke]> oh, you also sent an email. replied there with this and the chrome error

[13:22] <[Coke]> er, firefox

[13:22] <finanalyst> [Coke] I looked again at 920, its not related to the edit change. 

[13:23] <finanalyst> Its related to search options. I thought you had looked at seach before.

[13:24] <[Coke]> I did, yes.

[13:24] <[Coke]> the edit button doesn't do anything, I'm reporting the one error I see in console.

[13:25] <[Coke]> search works on that page.

[13:27] <finanalyst> good search works

[13:27] <[Coke]> now seeing some Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'WebSocket': Still in CONNECTING state. at renderSocket.onopen (101-basics:695:38)

[13:28] <finanalyst> thats more understandable

[13:29] <finanalyst> does clicking on 'edit' open a modal page?

[17:16] * [Coke] , after complaining about azure costs, get an email about spot virtual machines that are much cheaper but can be shut off.

[17:20] <nine> So Microsoft is reading our IRC logs?

[17:24] <[Coke]> heh

[17:24] <[Coke]> This client is running on an old mac mini, not in azure, so I hope not. :)

[17:34] <[Coke]> Does make me want to make blin runs resumable.

[17:37] <nine> If only all the effort that was put into blin would have benefited https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_ci_integration_bot instead. Then we'd not have to pay anything at all, have a full ecosystem CI run on every push and have it run highly parallel.

[17:38] <nine> Oh and we'd have much better coverage of native dependencies.

[17:44] *** [Coke] joined
[17:46] <[Coke]> Sorry, what all effort? the effort I spent getting blin to work for someone other than the single release manager?

[17:46] <[Coke]> You're right, shame that was.

[17:46] <[Coke]> (apologies if that's not what you  meant, but that's what I heard.)

[17:49] <[Coke]> AFK for a bit

[17:50] <nine> Blin did not write and maintain itself

[17:53] <nine> Of course you're trying to make the best of the situation. I'm lamenting that we got here in the first place. That wrong turn was taken long ago.

[18:13] <lizmat> nine: just found that "my Str sub foo { }" loses the Str in RakuAST

[18:15] <lizmat> assuming this winds up in token routine-declarator:sym<sub>

[18:16] <lizmat> and then into rule routine-def

[18:16] <lizmat> but I can't seem to find where the "Str" is parsed in that sequence

[18:16] <lizmat> what am I missing ?

[18:17] *** notna joined
[18:20] <lizmat> anyways, that may be LHF for you

[18:20] <nine> It's parsed by token scoped and ends up in $*OFTYPE

[18:21] <lizmat> aha!

[18:22] <lizmat> thanks!

[18:22] <lizmat> looks further into it

[18:29] <lizmat> ah, the absence of () triggers the issue

[18:42] <[Coke]> nine (long ago) thanks for clarifying, I appreciate it.
