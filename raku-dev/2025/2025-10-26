[09:01] <ab5tract> it feels like the nominalize code needs to be reverted or fixed, because as of now, it is actually and quite clearly broken

[09:02] <ab5tract> for example, calling SubsetHOW.nominalize doesn't return the subset type at all, it returns either the refinee or the nominalized refinee

[09:03] <ab5tract> That's a hell of a behavior change. I think the better approach would to ensure that nominalization happens prior to target attachment

[12:59] <ab5tract> ok so a subtest of subtests fail with `make  t/spec/S02-types/subset-6e.t` that do *not* fail when I extract said subtest, first class all its child subtests, and run

[13:01] <ab5tract> the result is every test passes. how useful for debugging? :O

[13:20] <ab5tract> can no one save me from this insanity? 👾

[20:34] <tellable6> 2025-10-25T21:31:12Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> melezhik: I kicked the container.

[20:34] <tellable6> 2025-10-25T21:39:32Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> melezhik: also wanted to suggest that you declare `config` as a term. that way you can use the associative access directly, no need for parentheses

[20:34] <melezhik_> put results of this weekend brownie demo to https://github.com/coke/blin2/issues/1#issuecomment-3448905787, thanks ab5tract: a lot for help and providing agents for testing

[20:35] <melezhik_> who ever wants to participate ask [Coke] for access to blin2
