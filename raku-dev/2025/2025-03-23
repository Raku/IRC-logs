[16:45] <coleman> finanalyst: I'll be around for a couple of hours. I can't do a call today, though. sorry for being out of pocket lately, but I just finished my first week at a new job

[17:35] <[Coke]> I'm here, apologies, took longer to get everything back to normal.

[17:35] <[Coke]> nine: What's the current status on these numbers:

[17:35] <[Coke]> x/153 (make test), and 1295/1355 (make spectest)

[17:36] <[Coke]> releasable6: status

[17:36] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. 277 out of 348 commits logged

[17:36] <releasable6> [Coke], Details: https://gist.github.com/f06df1a2d9b8602bde7d71d5b9925df7

[17:46] <[Coke]> Found 1298 spectest in backscroll - anyone see the latest number for 'make test'?

[17:48] <[Coke]> m: say 40*7+6

[17:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 69d4fcb4e: OUTPUT: «286␤»

[18:03] <jdv> its usually in the last weekly possibly outdated slightly

[18:06] <[Coke]> I'll take any numner at this point. :)

[18:09] <[Coke]> releasable6: status

[18:09] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. 347 out of 348 commits logged

[18:16] <[Coke]> ok, definitely want to do the changelog weekly next time I have a release, wowza.

[18:18] <nine> 1298 is latest

[18:20] <jdv> the 2 big pre-release tasks are blin and changelogs

[18:27] <[Coke]> Yup, shouldn't have saved CL for last day

[18:27] <[Coke]> nine-  did find that, just did a make test run and got 143?

[18:30] <[Coke]> which *is* 1 higher than the number in last announce.

[18:33] <nine> That's likely. lizmat++ did some work there

[18:38] <[Coke]> Undefined template variable 'contributors'

[18:43] <[Coke]> want to update the contributors script so you can have nqp be *next* to the rakudo folder instead of *in* it.

[19:06] <[Coke]> ... note to self, run the release commands in a tmux window on the remote box so when my (*@#&$#@$ POS mactop reboots because I plugged in a USB hub, I don't lose my place.

[19:16] <[Coke]> was it bsd tar that we want?

[19:18] <coleman> I forget what caused problems last time. Which file attribute?

[19:19] *** Altai-man left
[19:19] *** sena_kun joined
[19:21] <[Coke]> the date/time

[19:21] <[Coke]> I think installing bsdtar on this box and doing an alias tar=bsdtar will work

[19:21] <[Coke]> (also, writing this down)

[19:22] <coleman> that seems safe for the actual output. bsd will have a subset of what gnu provides, I'd wager

[19:22] <coleman> if anything fails it might be command line syntax related but you'll see

[19:23] *** sena_kun left
[19:24] <[Coke]> The moarvm instructions need to be sanitized. there's an extra 0 in the version info that is getting copied through a bunch of places.

[19:24] <[Coke]> need to make sure it doesn't show up in the final upload.

[19:25] *** sena_kun joined
[19:27] <jdv> [Coke]: wut?  iirc the extra 0 in the version is there for a reason

[19:38] <[Coke]> Really? if you can tell me what it is..

[19:38] <[Coke]> It appears to be "to confuse me". :)

[19:39] <[Coke]> It might be "to avoid confusing between tag and branch", but there's probabably a better way to do that.

[19:44] <[Coke]> Looking at https://moarvm.org/releases.html I see 2025.02

[19:45] <[Coke]> I don't see it in my clone. wtf.

[19:51] <[Coke]> HEY. Can someone give me rights to moarvm.org please.

[19:51] <[Coke]> (that's why I couldn't see anything, it was pointed at my fork)

[19:53] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/pull/22

[19:54] <coleman> I don't have admin on that

[19:54] <[Coke]> I would argue you should have admin.

[19:55] <[Coke]> Wonder if we have to ping jnthn.

[19:59] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases/tag/2025.03 - if someone can verify that the .targz for this release looks less squirrely

[20:02] <[Coke]> And also please apply my PR for moarvm.org

[20:02] <[Coke]> I'll go grab a hot bevvie before starting the next big step

[20:16] <[Coke]> going to put 4/26 as the next release, not 4/19

[20:17] <[Coke]> ... ahhhh, no I'm not.

[20:22] <[Coke]> ah, thank goodness there was no moarvm 2023.03

[20:22] <[Coke]> (or this would have been a very long detour. :)

[20:25] <[Coke]> jdv: running 'ake human-1' step on the azure box and getting an error that it is unable to sign the tag.

[20:26] <[Coke]> I cannot remember if, two months ago, I was running ake on my mac or on the ubuntu cloud box.

[20:28] <[Coke]> export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

[20:43] <[Coke]> t/12-rakuast/xx-fixed-in-rakuast.rakutest                     (Wstat: 0 Tests: 105 Failed: 0) TODO passed:   82-83

[20:47] <[Coke]> In general, this release is going smoother than 2025.01 - next one I do will go even smoother if I do the prep work *in advance*

[20:52] <jdv> probably need your php key loaded in the agent

[20:53] <[Coke]> it was the TTY

[20:53] <jdv> *pgp

[20:53] <jdv> oh

[20:53] <[Coke]> setting the TTY allowed it to prompt me so I could enter the passphrase.

[20:53] <[Coke]> Don't remember that step from last time, but writing it down in a different rakudo checkout for later. :)

[20:53] <jdv> weird default but sure

[20:53] <[Coke]> on `ake rakudo-test`

[20:54] <[Coke]> Don't want to hardcode it anywhere on a cloud box.

[21:02] <[Coke]> jdv: next time you do a release, please verify for me if "rakudo-stress" starts out saying Inline::Perl5 isn't installed

[21:10] <[Coke]> I think it was not the bsdtar perse, but the extra 0 on the branch name that did it. one instruction says do 2025.03 (but is really using 2025.030); and a future instruction tells you to use 2025.03 (but throws an error if you don't use the 2025.030) in moarvm. but that's also the thing that generates the tar.gz file, so you have to rename the file before you upload it.

[21:11] <[Coke]> `ake rakudo-stress-errata`

[21:13] <[Coke]> (bsdtar) using the wrong release # there caused a git command to not return a date, so then tar tried to use something NaN as a number and that's what did it.

[21:14] <[Coke]> I'll do a test release in a week or so to see if I can narrow down the bits (and wonder why this hasn't ever bitten jdv)

[21:27] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/roast/issues/872

[21:27] <[Coke]> Geth: you here/

[21:27] <[Coke]> geth: status

[21:58] <[Coke]> oops: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5829

[21:59] <[Coke]> So I think our last spec test run of the installed rakudo has been testing on 6.d errata this whole time, not on the main branch.

[22:05] *** lizmat left
[22:05] *** lizmat_ joined
[22:10] *** sena_kun left
[22:15] <jdv> [Coke]: i've never had that extra zero issue

[22:16] <jdv> yes, i did notice that roast branch issue but we test them all on the day of so...meh

[22:21] <[Coke]> m: my $x will init { say 3 }

[22:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 69d4fcb4e: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable trait 'will init {...}' not yet implemented. Sorry.␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my $x will init { say 3 }<HERE><EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[22:21] <[Coke]> ... dammit.

[22:27] <[Coke]> I think the errata tests leave around fudged files that preferentially get run.

[22:28] <[Coke]> which means that even though I tried to switch it back, this test still failed, because it was getting the fudged one from the branch, not the one that lizmat fixed.

[22:28] <[Coke]> ... or something else weird is going on. now getting failures on S04-declarations/will.t even though I'm on master? trying again...

[22:30] <jdv> isn't rakudo-post-test on a git-less archive expansion?

[22:31] <jdv> probably need to fix that up before the archive command

[22:32] <[Coke]> Maybe I was looking in the wrong dir

[22:33] <[Coke]> redoing rakudo-post-build and will then do rakudo-post-test

[22:33] <[Coke]> ... oh. I wonder if the archive has been archiving the errata dir ??

[22:35] <[Coke]> since it never got switched back? I switch it back, then reran the *post-test*, but if it was already archived...

[22:36] <[Coke]> ok, hopeful this gets us there. never would have noticed if not for this spec file failing in the errata.

[22:38] <[Coke]> updated https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5829 with my thoughts on the t/spec dir.

[22:39] <[Coke]> nine, lizmat, jdv: any thoughts on ^^ appreciated - I assume we want to be shipping roast's master in the rakudo tar.gz

[22:51] *** finanalyst left
[23:04] <jdv> idk if shipping roast was ever a huge consideration

[23:06] <jdv> sure, flip it to master.  i'd bet almost nobody uses that copy.

[23:38] <[Coke]> release guide complete; only thing left is binary packages.

[23:38] <[Coke]> (pinged them in #raku)

[23:38] <jdv> as far as i'm concerned "the release" is done:)

[23:39] <[Coke]> results this time: much smoother, opened a roast ticket that I did not fix directly for the errata, opened one or two RELENG tickets on rakudo, and have some minor edits pending.

[23:39] <[Coke]> jdv - if I make any changes to the Ake stuff, I'll mark you as a reviewer on a PR.

[23:40] <[Coke]> want at least one more set of eyes before submitting (same for release guide updates)

[23:40] <[Coke]> now off to have a sparkling beverage and chill out

[23:40] <jdv> i can look but idk if i'd be helpful
