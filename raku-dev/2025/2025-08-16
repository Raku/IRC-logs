[19:52] <tellable6> 2025-07-01T17:56:07Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> alexdaniel - can you commit on the plan to move whateverable to fez instead of the old "listing of github repos" ?

[19:52] <tellable6> 2025-07-01T17:56:48Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> alexdaniel - I mean comment

[19:53] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: what's the plan? Is there any link?

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> is whateverable even related to the ecosystem in any way? Is it about Blin?

[19:54] *** shareable6 joined
[19:54] *** bisectable6 joined
[19:55] <patrickb> So look behinds don't seem to work with sub regexes. Is this a bug?

[19:55] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Pretty sure this is about Blin.

[19:55] *** evalable6 joined
[19:55] *** linkable6 left
[19:56] *** linkable6 joined
[19:59] <AlexDaniel> I mean, if it's about https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/43, then I don't really have any say in it. If everyone is moving to the new ecosystem then sure, why not?

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> rakkable: help

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> oops, not a bot

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> sorry :D

[20:00] <patrickb> I guess Coke was just asking for your opinion on the move.

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> well, um. Thanks for caring, but nowadays I just maintain the services and I'm not rich in opinions¬†O:3

[20:03] <patrickb> Oh my. This is a really long standing bug: rakudo#1659

[20:03] <linkable6> RAKUDO#1659 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1659 [regex] <!after <token>> (mis)matching backwards

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> I'm just happing that the code that I wrote years ago is still being used :)

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> happy*

[20:14] * patrickb looks into P6Regex/Actions.nqp

[20:14] <patrickb> I'd love for timo to jump in and lend a helping hand...ü§ûüèª

[20:18] *** AlexDaniel left
[20:23] <patrickb> Oh! `flip_ast` is actually pretty small. This can't be that hard to get fixed. (Famous last words...)

[21:25] <patrickb> The more I think about it, the more I believe it's a pretty bad idea to allow more complex stuff in lookbehinds. Maybe a better idea would be to fail when seeing a sub rule in a lookbehind. There are no back compat issues as it's broken anyways...
