[15:47] <[Coke]> I am going to be in toronto for a chunk of this weekend.

[19:28] <japhb> [Coke]: What actual codepoints did you send?  (I'm pretty much assuming they got mangled in transit ...)

[19:32] <japhb> It looks like QUOTATION MARK, FACE PALM, EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-3, ZERO WIDTH JOINER, MALE SIGN, VARIATION SELECTOR-16, QUOTATION MARK if copy-paste is to be believed ...

[19:40] <[Coke]> (FACE PALM EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-3 ZERO WIDTH JOINER MALE SIGN VARIATION SELECTOR-16)

[19:40] <[Coke]> FACE PALM; EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-3; ZERO WIDTH JOINER; MALE SIGN; VARIATION SELECTOR-16

[19:40] <[Coke]> linked to somewhere in the weekly

[19:43] <[Coke]> something on Cool that probably shouldn't be.

[19:43] <[Coke]> LTA error, though

[20:40] <jdv> blin might be a little slower that usual.  hopefully it finishes.

[22:32] <japhb> fez:ver<100>:auth<zef:tony-o>:api<1> isn't installing for me at Rakudo HEAD.  Known?

[22:38] <ugexe> looks like one of the tests is causing it to open a prompt asking to update the config

[22:42] <ugexe> if i do `zef install fez:ver<100> --/test`, run `fez` and allow it to update my config, and finally `zef uninstall fez`, then `zef install fez:ver<100>` will install with passing tests

[22:43] <ugexe> that is on moar-blead

[22:43] <ugexe> tonyo: fyi^
