[17:44] <[Coke]> even though you were quite fast. my bad

[17:44] <[Coke]> MoarVM release done

[18:02] <[Coke]> huh. apparently we're building nqp & moar multiple times during the rakudo release, oops

[18:08] <lizmat> perhaps nqp wants to be sure it can build itself ?

[18:43] <[Coke]> it's much less bad than running the spectest 2x

[18:53] <[Coke]> t/spec/S09-hashes/objecthash.rakudo.moar is failing on 6c-errata

[18:54] <[Coke]> .. but passed on the second run

[18:55] <[Coke]> guessing there's an ordering problem since hash test?

[18:55] <lizmat> do you know the failing test ?

[18:55] <[Coke]> nope, it's the summary view.

[18:55] <lizmat> ack

[19:04] <[Coke]> er, builds nqp/moarvm twice from source (and then again from the tarball, but that one's fine)

[20:52] <tellable6> 2025-11-15T19:36:22Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> patrickb 2025.11 should be ready for binary releases now

[20:58] <patrickb> [Coke]bfound 'em. They were located in the nqp folder

[20:59] <patrickb> I'm moving them to the right folder now. But I guess this also needs a fix in the release script.

[21:00] <[Coke]> that was probably my fault!

[21:00] <[Coke]> Good find. Thank you

[21:00] <[Coke]> there are two manual copies there, and I updated the names of the files but not the path.

[21:02] <[Coke]> I had noted that it didn't show up, but I hadn't connected that to my idiocy. oops.

[21:22] <patrickb> no worries. it's already solved
