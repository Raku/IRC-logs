[17:15] <melezhik> Hi! Have already posted this to Raku channel , but maybe this is more relevant place to ask

[17:16] <melezhik> What’s is status of supporting Rakudo binaries for arm / risc-v ? Quoting some Rocky Linux people trying to use Sparrow  those platforms “Update... I remember I started the process of Sparrow/Sparky on Aarch64 and Risc-V but I couldn't remember how far I got... so I just did a refresher. Neither have pre-built RPM repos. Thus I started the more manual way for doing the install. For Aarch64 I had this issue:  $ rakubrew 

[17:16] <melezhik> download moar-2025.02

[17:17] <melezhik> 7:32 PM <disbot3> Couldn't find a precomp release for OS: "linux", architecture: "arm64", version: "2025.02" You can try building yourself. Use the `rakubrew build` command to do so.   and Risc-V I had this issue:  $ rakubrew download moar-2025.02 Couldn't detect system architecture. Current arch is: riscv64-linux-thread-multi Current uname -a is: Linux buildroot 6.12.0-55.34.1.el10_0.riscv64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Sep 26
