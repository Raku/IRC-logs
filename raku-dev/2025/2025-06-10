[04:04] <ab5tract> It occurs to me that once RakuAST is shipped as the default, we will probably want to make RAKUDO_RAKUAST=0 actually disable the new frontend. or else introduce a new environment variable eg RAKUDO_NO_RAKUAST, which feels a bit more awkward somehow but is probably equally acceptable in the end

[04:07] <ab5tract> actually the latter may be preferable, as it's weird to have an environment flag which is considered "on" by default

[04:46] <japhb> ab5tract: I suspect that will rot in a damn hurry unless we make sure to run all CI with and without it.

[04:47] <ab5tract> It can be temporary, but some people will prefer speed

[04:47] <ab5tract> And I don’t think we should block on that

[04:48] <ab5tract> But it’s a fair point. We can always refer such folk to an earlier release

[13:42] <timo> nine: can you describe what issue exactly that addresses? the issue liz had with assuming not getting everything into the correct serialization context and exploding with "missing static coderef for closure blabla (blabla)'

[14:02] <nine> Ah, no, that's just a fix for something MasterDuke was working on yesterday. Accidentally reposted due to input lag

[14:02] *** guifa joined
[14:05] <timo> oh, OK!

[14:24] <timo> is there a simple way to cause the entire compilation to "skip to the end" from inside a module that gets "use"d? (in this case from a -M switch)

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 3a86fd2d23 | timo++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | docs/release-guide-binary.md

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: When a release happens, remind timo about compiler-explorer

[14:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3a86fd2d23

[14:39] <timo> i guess i can literally "exit(0)" haha

[14:39] <timo> i don't really need for the rest of the normal compiler stuff to run probably

[14:53] <ab5tract> timo: ooc, what’s the use case?

[15:01] <timo> ehehehehe.

[15:02] *** guifa left
[15:03] <timo> i'll show something soon I hope

[15:03] *** guifa joined
[15:03] <timo> here's a fun one: when there's a -e on the commandline, and we "use" a module, the code inside the module seems to be attributed to "-e" instead of the actual filename

[15:03] <timo> actually, not sure if that"s also for explicitly putting a "use" statement, i'm still woking with -M

[15:05] <timo> it may be required to put "no precompilation" in that used modul as well

[15:08] <timo> maybe important that i'm using -Ilib since i didn't write a META6 yet

[15:45] <ab5tract> hmmm... yeah there's a few moving parts there, I guess

[15:47] <ab5tract> But ISTR that there is a relatively naive check related to `-e` when determining the file name / line number

[15:55] <ab5tract> How was the RSC? I'm bummed to have missed it, though I had a good weekend as well

[16:25] <timo> it was good, i enjoyed it

[17:13] <ab5tract> \o/

[17:21] <timo> maybe the next summit we'll have a chance to meet in person, that would be great

[17:50] <timo> putting a $?FILES in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/3dad1a55ae1587cee58df8e10474a1551cf97741/src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/FileSystem.rakumod#L127 is at least where i can give it a file that shows up, but $name is just the name of the compunit, so not a path and not a filename since it has the extension stripped

[18:34] <ab5tract> timo: I'd love for these summits to happen regularly, as often as possible really :)

[19:10] <timo> the natural name for a blog engine (not static site generator per se) would be MyCroBlog

[19:10] <timo> or i guess Cro::Blog so you can `my Cro::Blog $foo .= new;`

[19:18] * lizmat waves from Echt, really!

[19:18] <timo> you made it back!

[19:28] <lizmat> yeah, we did a bit of a visit to Amsterdam and then to Nijmegen, and now home again

[19:28] <lizmat> pretty tired though  :-)

[19:35] <timo> my neck still feels stiff, my body did not agree with the mattress i think :(

[19:35] <lizmat> timo: sorry to hear that... :-(
