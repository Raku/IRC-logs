[07:52] <nine> ab5tract: that's why I refused to work on these problems. I don't know why the tests are expecting what they are expecting, the code is hard to decifer and the author never cared to explain.

[07:58] <[Tux]> ab5tract, see the three links below the stats

[07:59] <[Tux]> the -20 entries are dealing with 20 times the amount of data

[08:56] <[Tux]> perl5-xs 0.013 vs raku 0.449

[10:58] <ab5tract> nine: hmm, okay I will stop scratching at it then. Still, it leaves us at a bit of an impass...

[10:59] <nine> It does. Either someone needs to just power through this, the tests get removed or vrurghelps out

[11:03] <ab5tract> The idea of properly supporting nested use of generics does make sense. I'm not sure about the syntax (feels like it should be `R[Int]::Foo`) but I spent some time thinking about it

[11:04] <ab5tract> and it's actually not a big deal to keep the signature at the end, since all arguments to anything happening under `R` need to be specified in the same signature

[12:02] <ab5tract> So one thing that occurred to me was the add a new new RakuAST::Name::Part for the role parameterization

[14:39] <ab5tract> vrurg_: any chance you might have some tuits to spend on helping unlock me on this?

[14:43] <vrurg_> ab5tract: Unfortunately, I'm totally out of free time. 

[14:45] <vrurg_> And the subject is as complicated as rocket science. Not sure I remember much of it now. 

[14:51] <ab5tract> Bummer :(

[14:56] <ab5tract> vrurg_: the commits I see touching the relevant files are related to getting type smilies working

[14:56] <ab5tract> Did you do other work on generics?

[15:00] <vrurg_> ab5tract: There are few related PR merged 2 years ago. There was a LOT.
