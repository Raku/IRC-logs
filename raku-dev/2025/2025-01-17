[12:50] <bisectable6> lizmat, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[12:51] <bisectable6> lizmat, Bisecting by output (old=2024.10 new=2024.12) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[12:51] <lizmat> yeah, thought so  :-(

[13:03] <timo> the R goes before the # i think

[13:03] <lizmat>  R#5761

[13:03] <linkable6> R#5761 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5761 [regression] `.trans` doesn't honor capture markers (`<(` and `)>`) in regexes anymore

[13:03] <lizmat> indeed ... thanks   :-)

[18:11] <timo> i don't know what a non-app-lifetime thread should output in its .gist

[18:18] *** finanalyst left
[18:20] <lizmat> nothing ?   as it's the default ?

[18:28] <timo> this is in reference to the pull request that adds "app-lifetime thread" to the .gist of a thread that is app-lifetime. it was suggested to put something in there for non-app-lifetime instead

[18:28] <timo> i guess if it should put nothing, then i at least don't have to write any code

[18:32] <lizmat> hmmm... now I am confused: the default for Thread.new is non-app-lifetime, right ?

[18:34] <timo> i think so
