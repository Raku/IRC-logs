[00:01] <ab5tract> ugexe: thanks for taking a look!

[00:03] <timo> should i kick the job to run again or something?

[00:03] <ab5tract> Any opinion on whether the changes to `X::Multi::NoMatch` should be left in place?

[00:06] <ab5tract> timo: no worries, I think I ought to rebase at least, if not outright change a few bits and bobs

[00:08] <timo> ` use variables :_; ` it has a different kind of smiley in it :D

[00:10] <timo> patrickb: do you prefer if i put highlighting issues i see on the github issue in raku/doc-website, or is it fine to ping you here on irc?

[00:14] *** finanalyst left
[00:37] <timo> well, i wrote it all up now :)

[00:37] <timo> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/419#issuecomment-2571454164 it has screenshots!

[00:39] <timo> https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Type_constraints_and_initialization has the output line-breaked (presumably by hand in the source code) so the second half of the error is highlighted as if it were code. not an issue with Rainbow, but something needing a one-line fix in the source that i'm too lazy to do myself right now

[00:57] <[Coke]> checking

[01:01] <[Coke]> fixed

[01:37] <timo> dope

[01:38] <timo> when do we build something that transforms the rendered doc page into an editor with the click of a button without even a page reload :D

[01:48] <SmokeMachine> My 3 distros are on raku.land now! It seems it was just a delay… thank you all

[02:05] <timo> good!

[08:33] <patrickb> timo: As long as you ensure I actually notice it, it doesn't matter much.

[08:37] <patrickb> timo: Are you aware you could also send an email to ~patrickb/Rainbow@todo.sr.ht ? (Only hastle: It has to be a plain text email.)

[08:38] <patrickb> timo: Thanks for persistently reporting those!

[10:08] <timo> no problem :)

[14:35] <timo> ugexe: thanks for getting started on the "use 64bits in decoder" work. i think your suspicion that there's more places that need changes is correct. i've marked up some places where i could see that we're mixing 32bit and 64bit where it's likely trouble, but i make no claim to have found everything

[14:35] <timo> we might actually be able to get away with doing a different change, however

[14:36] <timo> we have these MVMDecodeStreamBytes and MVMDecodeStreamChars structs that have 32bit size fields. Maybe when we encounter something that's too big, we simply split it into as many parts as needed

[14:36] <timo> then not so much code has to change, I think

[14:37] <timo> however, there's some places that still use 32bit ints to represent "position in the total data", or at least from a first glance it looks like they are. maybe those are actually all refering to inside a single DecodeStream*s and it's fine to keep them at 32?

[14:38] <timo> hmm.

[14:38] <timo> maybe the "minimum necessary change" in your first comment is closer to "the right solution" after all

[14:46] *** guifa left

[14:47] <timo> so bytes_head_pos and chars_head_pos as well as the length members of the MVMDecodeStream*s could probably stay 32bit without too much trouble

[16:00] <ugexe> thats the other thing that might be sus

[16:01] <ugexe> the (MVMint32)chars when chars in the function signature is typed as MVMin64
