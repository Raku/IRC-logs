[14:52] <[Coke]> lizmat, I think you had mentioned something like this - be nice if there was a hook so I could have a bunch of repl shortcut routines or things to change behavior. (like, some easy way to get a list of values that would normally be printed as is to go through .sort.unique

[14:53] <[Coke]> right now, I think I'd have to write that module, export a bunch of stuff into the main namespace, then invoke the REPL pre-loading that module, and explicitly call my routine when I wanted it. (doable, but a lot of typing at runtime?)

[16:31] <lizmat> [Coke]: the latest version of REPL has a =read command: https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/REPL#read-path

[16:32] <lizmat> you could put the necessary (ad-hoc) code in a file, and then =read it in the REPL

[18:58] <[Coke]> I have a small preference for doing the release this December.

[18:59] <[Coke]> (so I can then say I did Christmas and the 10 year anniversary)

[18:59] <lizmat> hehe... you're quite welcome!

[20:29] <lizmat> [Coke]: the most recent version of Ecosystem::Cache will now build a local cache of all of the most recent modules in the ecosystem  (takes about 1.1G of space)

[20:30] <lizmat> [Coke]: the most recent version of App::Rak now has the --code-from, --provides-from, --scripts-from, --tests-from options to just search in that cache

[20:31] <lizmat> code = all code, provides = all files mentioned in "provides" sections, scripts = all files in "bin" directories in distributions, and tests = all test-files in distributions

[20:32] <lizmat> a typical search with App::Rak in there takes about 10 seconds  (no results in --code-from)

[20:33] <lizmat> that searches about 21.5K files  :-)

[20:35] <lizmat> next step: setting up a bot that will run queries, a la greppable6

[20:35] <lizmat> but that's for tomorrow

[20:46] <lizmat> afk&
