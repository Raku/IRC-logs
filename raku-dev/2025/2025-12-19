[09:48] <ab5tract> I'm confused about lazy list handling in feed operators

[09:48] <ab5tract> As far as I can tell, there is no way to create a call that takes a single element. But that seems to be a necessary feature for handling lazy lists?

[09:49] <ab5tract> m: [1,2,3].roll(*) ==> say()

[09:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «(...)␤»

[09:50] <ab5tract> m: [1,2,3].roll(*) ==> { $_ + 5 }() ==> dd()

[09:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «Failure.new(exception => X::Cannot::Lazy.new(action => ".elems", what => ""))␤»

[09:50] <ab5tract> m: [1,2,3].roll(*) ==> { $_.map: * + 5 }() ==> dd()

[09:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «(7, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 8, 7, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 6, 7, 6, 8, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 8, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8…»

[09:52] <ab5tract> I don't see any great utility in feed operators if you still have to call map?

[09:55] <ab5tract> Well nevermind, my main concern was that objects implementing .append can't be combined, but it looks like I was doing a dumb by using for instead of .map

[09:58] <timo> m: [1,2,3].roll(*) ==> map { $_ + 5 } ==> dd()

[09:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «(7, 8, 7, 8, 6, 8, 6, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8, 8, 6, 7, 6, 8, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8, 7, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 7, 7, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 8, 7, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8…»

[11:41] <ab5tract> Here's a gist that demonstrates some of my struggle with feeds

[11:42] <ab5tract> An aside, but still about feeds.. I'm wondering whether we could ever allow Callables instead of Calls for the pipeline expressions

[12:49] *** finanalyst joined
[13:06] <[Coke]> Any more commits expected before release?

[13:20] <[Coke]> might cut the release branch later today

[13:22] * lizmat is not planning any

[13:59] <lizmat> m: class A { q/has $.foo/.EVAL }; BEGIN dd A.^attributes>>.name; dd A.^attributes>>.name

[13:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «()␤("\$!foo",)␤»

[13:59] <lizmat> this implies that you can add attributes at runtime?

[14:00] <lizmat> I wonder whether this is a bug or a feature

[14:06] *** finanalyst left
[14:13] <timo> the attribute will have a hard time working without calling compose on the type afterwards, right?

[14:17] <lizmat> m: class A { q/has $.foo = 42/.EVAL }; dd A.new

[14:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «P6opaque: no such attribute '$!foo' on type A in a A when trying to get a value␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:17] <lizmat> m: class A { BEGIN q/has $.foo = 42/.EVAL }; dd A.new

[14:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 159288a3d: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => 42)␤»

[14:18] <lizmat> so only if the outer compunit is still compiling, could we consider allowing this

[17:05] * lizmat just added a new alias:  alias rut='(){ RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 raku -e "$1; CHECK dd" }'

[17:05] <lizmat> which will show the RakuAST tree for the given Raku code:    rut 'say "foo"
