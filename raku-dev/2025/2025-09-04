[11:54] <[Coke]> Any thoughts on switching to a bi-monthly or quarterly release cycle by default in 2026?

[11:57] <lizmat> I guess it depends on the release manager(s) ?

[11:57] <lizmat> and the number of changes ?

[12:00] <[Coke]> Sure, we can always make a decision each month, just wondering if we're at a point in number of commits per month in 2025 that indicates we should reduce the default # per year.

[12:01] <[Coke]> (and we could still do a release on an off month if needed, etc.)

[12:01] <[Coke]> No rush, no pressure, just curious if anyone has any thoughts.

[12:02] <[Coke]> pros: reduce efforts for release, cons: might be negative marketing.

[13:40] <Geth> ¦ Blin: coke self-assigned Create ARM template to setup environment for Blin testing https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/45

[13:43] <Geth> ¦ Blin: coke self-assigned Blin runs should be resumable https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/40

[13:44] <jdv> you mean run blin on arm?  iirc arm is slow cause there is no jit.

[15:43] <[Coke]> ... no

[15:43] <[Coke]> I mean automatically create an azure VM capable of running blin.

[15:44] <[Coke]> (mainly so I don't have to rely on keeping this hand-rolled one alive)

[15:45] <[Coke]> added a link to the arm docs to clarify, thanks

[22:51] <jdv> oh.  so azure gets to take "arm" now?  I didn't know!

[22:52] <jdv> once we get it communityified or whatever it should be easier to blin.  that's what i was blocking on when i was trying to do something with it.

[22:53] <jdv> i think i'm still using my hand patched one from...(and docker says) "19 months ago".  yup, its old.

[22:54] <jdv> in any case sounds cool for you
