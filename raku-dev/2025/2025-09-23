[07:34] <ab5tract> anyone know whether it's by design that EVAL'd code can't access the doc variables of its outer scope?

[07:34] <ab5tract> lizmat shared this with me: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/69c4568c618b4000f2bc65e18d1a270b

[07:37] <ab5tract> in my code the output looks like this: https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/538a991b64e43e544656799a0dee3fca

[07:58] <ab5tract> lizmat: thanks!

[08:00] <ab5tract> The issue I'm having with the EVAL stuff is that when the EVAL CU visits its doc vars, I get re-declaration errors

[08:00] <ab5tract> I've got to run now but I'll get the output you mentioned in your comment this afternoon hopefully

[08:04] <ab5tract> hmm, I thought it would have pushed to the open PR, I guess I made another branch

[12:59] * [Coke] ponders where to post a small update about getting us onboarded with Snyk, and guesses bluesky is fine?

[16:03] <[Coke]> That is not true.

[16:07] <[Coke]> Might need to update the "next release date" in the release guide.

[23:37] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/docker/blob/master/2025.08.1/bookworm/Dockerfile - why do we rename the dockerfile every release?

[23:40] <[Coke]> if we kept the historic ones it might make sense, but it looks like we create a new one and delete the old one.

[23:43] <[Coke]> (makes it slightly harder to deal with repository scanning - I just had to rescan to get the new ones, and then manually delete the old ones that had already been id'd by Snyk)
