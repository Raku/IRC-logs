[08:59] <ab5tract> japhb: you hit the FD limit in the OS, right?

[09:00] <ab5tract> this $=finish thing is pretty tisted

[09:04] <ab5tract> *twisted

[09:05] <ab5tract> I can confirm that the $COMPUNIT.finish exists and has the correct .value before $COMPUNIT.to-begin-time is called in Actions.nqp

[09:06] <ab5tract> but adding $!finish to PRODUCE-IMPLICIT-DECLARATIONS

[09:06] <ab5tract> doesn't accomplish anything

[09:07] <ab5tract> (PRODUCE-IMPLICIT-DECLARATIONS in CompUnit)

[09:11] *** lizmat joined
[09:11] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[09:20] <ab5tract> AFAICT, $!finish should be visited during to-begin-time, which should plop the declaration into the current scope

[09:25] <lizmat> ab5tract: you mean $=finish ?

[09:25] <lizmat> that should live in UNIT

[09:25] <lizmat> m: dd UNIT::<$=finish>:exists

[09:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 596e83949: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[09:37] <ab5tract> unit points to the current compunit, right?

[09:37] <ab5tract> anyway, it's not about the user side of things, this is an ordering problem in the compiler somehow

[09:37] <ab5tract> R#5855

[09:37] <linkable6> R#5855 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5855 [RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1] Could not find a compile-time-value for lexical $=finish

[10:07] *** finanalyst left
[10:32] <ab5tract> well, I've got it compiling

[10:32] <ab5tract> CHECK $=finish works

[10:32] <ab5tract> but CHECK UNIT::<$=finish> returns `Any` instead of the expected contents

[10:52] <ab5tract> I'm not sure how much of a dealbreaker that is ..

[10:53] <ab5tract> whoa, what!

[10:53] <ab5tract> I just fixed it :O

[11:00] <[Coke]> nice

[11:01] <ab5tract> doh, rakuast flag was unset :(

[11:05] <lizmat> ab5tract++

[11:05] <ab5tract> I have a feeling I'm solving it improperly, but maybe it still means we are getting closer

[11:14] <ab5tract> I'm really curious how these implicit vars get attached (eventually) to the UNIT psuedostash

[11:21] <ab5tract> lizmat: any idea how the pseudostashes are created and filled in?

[11:32] <ab5tract> so yeah, the above is probably not a proper fix

[11:32] <ab5tract> CHECK say +UNIT::.keys; # 0

[11:32] <evalable6> ab5tract, rakudo-moar f56482941: OUTPUT: «722␤»

[11:33] <ab5tract> so I think the real issue is that UNIT is not populated.. and I have no idea how to fix that

[15:29] <[Coke]> releasable6: status

[15:29] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[15:29] <releasable6> [Coke], Details: https://gist.github.com/58b4d6dae959e7f0981a3b47e701574d

[15:30] <[Coke]> why is that saying "when it's ready"? :(

[15:34] *** librasteve_ left
[16:24] <japhb> ab5tract: In this case I was hitting the default FD limit, yeah.  But ulimit can reduce that (though not in this particular case), and thus is what should actually be paid attention to.

[16:35] <jdv_> [Coke]: that's a good question.  the release guide looks correct.  idk...

[16:35] <jdv_> oh, no.  its listed in the todo and the done sections:(  my bad.

[16:37] <jdv_> fixed

[16:49] <[Coke]> (so that wasn't you)

[16:50] <[Coke]> ... didn't we have a 2025.08??

[16:54] <[Coke]> starting there we don't have commitable builds.

[16:54] <[Coke]> .ask alex.daniel is commitable not building new revisions atm?

[16:54] <tellable6> [Coke], I cannot recognize this command. See wiki for some examples: https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/wiki/Tellable

[16:54] <[Coke]> .ask alexdaniel is commitable not building new revisions atm?

[16:54] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel

[16:54] <[Coke]> if someone can fix that, I can start the blin run.

[17:05] <jdv_> oh.  was afk.

[17:05] <jdv_> idk then:)

[17:05] <jdv_> yes, i did the 2025-08 release.  unless it was a fever dream.

[17:06] <jdv_> later &

[17:08] <[Coke]> releasable6: next?

[17:08] <releasable6> [Coke], Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[17:08] <[Coke]> I also did start the changelog. :(

[17:09] <[Coke]> we only have 6 commits to process at the moment.

[17:10] <[Coke]> (since last release)

[17:10] <[Coke]> and only 3 of those are "real"

[17:10] <[Coke]> so we can probably skip again this release.

[17:21] <lizmat> I would concur

[18:22] <[Coke]> OK. I'm still on the next one since jdv did the last one.

[18:24] <[Coke]> weekly: skipping September release. Do we need to advertise that?

[18:24] <notable6__> [Coke], Noted! (weekly)

[18:24] <[Coke]> I am seeing jdv in a few hours, will also ping him on this.

[19:43] <patrickb> After a two week delay, I've finally composed the rakudo 2025.08 compiled release files.

[19:43] <patrickb> Yay!(?)
