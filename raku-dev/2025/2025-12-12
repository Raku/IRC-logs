[09:39] <melezhik_> [Coke]: I've added only-with-failed-tests checkbox to show only modules with failed unit tests ( filter our "noise" like absence of META6.json or missing dependencies ) - https://pasteboard.co/qUv3dMDeDcPL.jpg

[09:41] <melezhik_> also after minor fixes on Brownie side , diff 2025.11/2025.10 shows only one module - http://brw.sparrowhub.io/report/brw-reporter/65

[09:42] <melezhik_> agains diffs only show if module A did not pass unit tests in Rakudo  version X , and passed unit tests in Rakudo version Y, where Y is older then X

[09:43] <melezhik_> this reflects the idea of focusing only on Rakudo related issues, 

[09:44] <melezhik_> to get FULL list of failed modules (regardless the reason of failure) for Rakudo version X - need to run report job -> failed -> without only-with-failed-tests checked

[10:00] <melezhik_> Ok - https://github.com/FCO/test-time/issues/2 , add Test::Time to skip list

[13:40] <[Coke]> I mean, star comes with other modules installed - I could see some optional module causing issues if it was pre-installed on one and not the other.

[13:41] <[Coke]> Will also do a final blin run this weekend.

[13:42] <[Coke]> Not sure it matters, but can you do "zef --version" and "zef info Kind" and see if those differ between those?

[13:42] <[Coke]> Maybe R* bundled an old zef?

[13:43] <patrickb> [Coke]: Do you think it'd still be responsible to do a largeish merge given the next release is around the corner?

[13:43] <[Coke]> I do see they are using different top level tmp folders

[13:44] <[Coke]> depends. what's it's for?

[13:44] <[Coke]> Anything big should happen before the blin run this weekend, for sure.

[13:46] <patrickb> I'm pondering merging the PTY PRS

[13:46] <patrickb> that encompasses moving libuv to a temporary fork with the libuv PTY patch.

[13:46] <patrickb> When would be the deadline?

[13:47] <patrickb> thinking about it. it would also be nice to get the windows zef issue solved by then...

[15:00] <melezhik> [Coke]: I still need to check I think it’s but a Rakudo star issue , it somehow relates to container environment. I see the same problem with whateverable Rakudo and Rakudo installed from source - if they run on container

[15:10] <ugexe> presumably the issue is exactly where the error message pointed out

[15:10] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/2c6ab9ff94bb0f786c21c46bd05f9a2305bf0471/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod#L922

[15:11] <ugexe> seems like that would have been the obvious first thing to look at 

[15:21] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/6041

[15:22] <ugexe> as far as what zef should do im open to suggestions

[15:23] <ugexe> the existing logic aims to open a new shell, but it tries to use the same shell you are already using. this is primarily for windows users who might be launching via the x86 command line tools shell or whatever it was called vs powershell vs command prompt

[15:23] <ugexe> i'm not sure what it should do if e.g. ENV<SHELL> isn't defined

[15:23] <ab5tract> patrickb: regarding the `anon` scope, there is a method on Package and family that returns the allowed scopes. might be worth adding `anon` there and seeing what happens :)

[15:23] <ugexe> maybe just adding // '' would be sufficient

[22:52] <patrickb> Coke: I fail to reproduce the Windows zef doesn't work bug. Can you provide details on how you set up the VM? Chances should be pretty high to reproduce the issue if I create a VM just like you did.

[23:05] <[Coke]> it's an azure VM; I gave details in the ticket about how I installed rakubrew.

[23:05] <[Coke]> I can give you the systeminfo if that helps

[23:06] <[Coke]> I can also just give you access to the box.

[23:10] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/07f2f55fcd569e705040ee5e0c582fbd

[23:11] <patrickb> I'm off to bed for today. But system access would be the easiest way forward. How much am I then allowed to mess with the system?

[23:12] <[Coke]> as much as you want, I can always recreate from scratch if needed.
