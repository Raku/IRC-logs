[17:12] <[Coke]> if I publish something to tonyo's test ecosystem... that's not used by zef yet, correct? Will things carry over when it goes live?

[17:12] <[Coke]> Or is it basically a throwaway at this point?

[18:13] <patrickb> Unsure, but I think it's pushing things to the actual eco

[18:21] <tonyo> it'll go to the main index

[18:21] <tonyo> and it will publish immediately

[18:22] <tonyo> we're out of test ecosystem phase

[19:21] <[Coke]> so the testing part is the fez code itself, not the ecosystem?

[19:21] <[Coke]> Thanks.

[20:31] <patrickb> The server side is also new. Just the place where it's pushing the data to is the same afaik.
