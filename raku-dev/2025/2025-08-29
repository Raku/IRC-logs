[20:46] <[Coke]> jdv: https://github.com/rakudo/star/issues/212#issuecomment-3238213667 ?

[20:46] <[Coke]> Looks like a release download URL isn't there for this release. (I haven't check the guide, but I'm guessing this is some automatic github step?)

[21:57] <jdv> got me.  im away til tues though.

[22:12] <jdv> that file is available from rakudo.org but looks like i forgot to push them to gh.  probably when i noticed i screwed up the announce.  i just pushed them.

[22:13] <jdv> [Coke]: ^

[23:43] <[Coke]> verified, it's there. thanks!
