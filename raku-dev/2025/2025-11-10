[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Don't allow a Range in an array shape specification (#6013)

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Because it probably does *not* do what you think it does.

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Before this, my @a[1..4] would create a 4-dimensional array, with

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: dimensions 1,2,3,4.  Instead of defining a 1-dimensional array

[09:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: with indices 1 through 4.

[20:30] <timo> lizmat: it looks like the code that was commented out in Raku/ast/literals.rakumod for Format literals now works as you wrote it back then

[20:30] <timo> JimmyZ, the stuff your AI IDE told you was just complete nonsense

[20:40] <lizmat> timo: sadly, it doesn't:

[20:40] <lizmat> % RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 raku -Ilib -MB -e ''

[20:40] <lizmat> ===SORRY!===

[20:40] <lizmat> Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure '' (src/Raku/ast/code.rakumod:145)

[20:40] <timo> ah, doesn't work with precomp, right

[20:41] <lizmat> yeah  :-(

[20:41] <lizmat> thanks for checking!

[20:41] <timo> QAST::Want already takes an object value in its first spot. anything after that is supposed to be a native value with a type tag in front, or what the node should compile to in void context if the type tag is "v". anything else is a no-op

[20:44] <lizmat> you mean the QAST::Wval would need to be wrapped in a QAST::Want ?

[20:44] <timo> no

[20:45] <timo> that's in response to the pull request

[20:45] <lizmat> which one ?

[20:45] <timo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/6012

[20:48] <lizmat> well, I think closing that PR is the right cause of action, as JimmyZ suggested ?

[20:48] <timo> right

[20:49] <timo> i thought i'd give a bit of extra explanation

[20:49] <timo> the AI came up with a way to use Want to get what you normally need to not use a Want to get

[20:49] <lizmat> well, I guess more appropriate as a comment there, rather than here?   or are you expecting the AI to pick it up from here?

[20:50] <timo> i don't think the AI will pick something up from the pull request comments, but JimmyZ reads the channel i believe

[20:50] <lizmat> ok

[20:50] <lizmat> afk&

[22:29] <patrickb> I'd like to finally fix our mis-configured Azure CI in NQP.

[22:29] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/805

[22:30] <patrickb> A possible way out could be to revoke Azure CI access to Github in the `Raku` github org. Only an Org Admin can do that.

[22:31] <patrickb> I don't know who is an admin in that org though.

[23:14] <[Coke]> where on azdo?

[23:20] <[Coke]> ah, it's under settings, github apps?

[23:20] <[Coke]> one of the options is "uninstall "azure pipelines" but: that removes its access to everything.

[23:25] <[Coke]> I can't see where any raku/nqp pipeline is. weird.

[23:28] <patrickb> Coke: I think the nqp repo is the only one using azure

[23:28] <patrickb> so removing it from via the org (temporarily) should not do any harm
