[19:59] <[Coke]> timo requested I added my key info here: https://rakudo.org/downloads/verifying#gpg2-key-list

[19:59] <[Coke]> I assume this is tied to the GPG key I have added on my github/coke settings.

[20:02] <[Coke]> ... If anyone can step me through how to get the info I need from the existing key to put ont hat rakudo.org page, greatly appreciated.

[23:08] <timo> you can `gpg --armor --export id-of-key` to get a big "PGP PUBLIC KEY" block, which should be fine to post as a file, and `gpg --fingerprint` should list all your keys including their full fingerprints (--fingerprint twice will also include subkeys which i don't think are relevant here)
