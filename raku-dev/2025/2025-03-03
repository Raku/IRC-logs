[00:16] <timo> when we compile the core setting, we now specialize the proto token 'twigil' to check if a fate is the one for twigil:<.> and directly invoke the corresponding bytecode object (and deopt if it doesn't match)

[00:16] *** patrickb joined
[00:16] *** evalable6 joined
[00:39] <jdv> what does it mean?

[01:44] <timo> in this case i think the twigil proto token was called 150 times and out of those 150 times 1 called out to twigil:<.> and the other 149 were not matches, and then spesh made a plan to optimize it, saw that the only thing that has happened so far was a call to twigil:<.> so it optimized for that case if it ever gets into the loop where it goes through the fates

[10:10] <lizmat> do we have a way to introspect the Str / Int parts of the parameterization without resorting to picking apart the stringification ?

[14:39] <nine> PSA: don't expect any more for the next few days. Wrote that last fix in the doctor's waiting room. Cought me some stomach flu and my challenge for the next period of time is to get some water down

[14:45] <timo> i wish you a speedy recovery, that sounds very uncomfortable

[15:05] <nine> Zero stars. Don't recommend.

[15:13] <[Coke]> nine: get well soon, sorry!

[16:14] <lizmat> nine: get well soon, recommendation saved for future reference

[16:25] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: looks like there are two versions of your blog post live

[16:26] <SmokeMachine> Really, I’ve archived the first one… :( let me take a look…

[16:28] <coleman> feel better none

[16:28] <tellable6> 2025-02-23T11:08:04Z #raku-dev <finanalyst> coleman could we have a conversation over Jitsi/Zoom as soon as possible? I have three topics: new Caddy (v2), online REPL, setting up new version of raku site (I think we may have misunderstood each other)

[16:28] <coleman> nine

[16:29] <coleman> finanalyst, sure thing. i will send you an email!

[16:30] <finanalyst> coleman, just got a new version working. Try new-raku.finanalyst.org

[16:30] <SmokeMachine> Odd, it shows me it as archived…

[16:31] <coleman> Looks great, and more responsive 

[16:31] <finanalyst> also multilingual UI

[16:32] <finanalyst> search is slightly different

[16:32] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: maybe archived still means it's live

[16:32] <lizmat> just not able to receive comments anymore

[16:32] <coleman> finanalyst, can i drop a jitsi link? i have some time now

[16:32] <finanalyst> definitely

[16:32] <SmokeMachine> I think I unpublished it
