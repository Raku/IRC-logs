[18:35] <lizmat> m: say DateTime.now.WHICH   # why isn't DateTime a value type ?

[18:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 65cda29b9: OUTPUT: «DateTime|6333426610864␤»

[18:36] <lizmat> m: dd DateTime.now.WHICH   # why isn't DateTime a value type ?

[18:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 65cda29b9: OUTPUT: «ObjAt.new("DateTime|6222529192624")␤»

[18:37] <timo> was DateTime a type that can hold a timezone?

[18:37] <lizmat> yes

[18:38] <lizmat> but the .in-timezone method returns a new DateTime object, so still immutable afaics

[18:39] <timo> ah, so the ValueObjAt would have the timezone as well

[18:39] <lizmat> yup

[18:39] <lizmat> well, could/should  :-)

[18:40] <lizmat> m: say DateTime.now   # stringification should be fine for .WHICH

[18:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 65cda29b9: OUTPUT: «2025-07-20T20:40:34.408097+02:00␤»

[18:40] <timo> except that's slower than for example hexadecimal-ing the number

[18:41] <timo> + the time offset

[18:41] <timo> otherwise yeah

[18:41] <lizmat> which number ?

[18:42] <timo> 6333426610864

[18:42] <lizmat> that's the memory address of that instance

[18:42] <timo> oh!

[18:43] <timo> i meant the unix timestamp behind the object

[18:43] <SmokeMachine> No one asked me… but I agree that should be a value type…

[18:43] <lizmat> there is none, one can be created

[18:44] <timo> oh, the datetime object has date bits inside?

[18:44] <timo> i should think more before speaking, clearly

[18:44] <lizmat> anyways.. it looks like DateTime *can* be mutated if an instance lives past a daylight saving change

[18:45] <lizmat> yuck

[18:47] <SmokeMachine> :(

[18:47] <SmokeMachine> Could it be avoided?

[18:50] <lizmat> perhaps, at a language level change, and making clear that it will *not* properly report instances during a daylight saving change event

[18:51] <lizmat> but that feels like we would be introducing action at a distance

[18:51] <timo> if the datetime has a timezone set in it, it would have to have either the one or the other to refer to the correct moment

[18:52] <lizmat> well, that's the thing: we don't force setting a timezone on a DateTime object

[18:53] <lizmat> hmm... maybe I'm reading this wrong

[18:54] <timo> if you've got a DateTime without a timezone, it refers to many different moments, subject to interpretation

[18:56] <timo> before vs after a "local timezone has changed its offset" event is simply a difference in interpretation that can catch you off-guard if your code is naive. ideally we would make it as easy as possible to not get caught off guard, but that results in having to write verbose code that seems unnecessarily complicated for all times except when something weird happens

[18:56] <lizmat> ok, so maybe it should be a ValueObjAt after all

[19:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈38 days and ≈23 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft
