[18:26] <[Coke]> late start today (lots of stuff going on in the house), starting release work in about 15m

[18:27] <[Coke]> going to rollback that last minute merge to MoarVM/main

[18:39] <jdv> 2 bumps too:(

[18:40] <[Coke]> eh. was going to have to update the bumps anyway

[18:40] <jdv> really?

[18:40] <[Coke]> Those can just move forward, I think

[18:41] <[Coke]> I didn't see them, but surely I have to make the bumps to the tags, and I doubt the changes just now did that?

[18:41] <jdv> i mean, aside from release bumps.  i guess you can bump "backwards"

[18:41] <jdv> the release tool does the release bumpings

[18:41] <[Coke]> right, but why bump back and then bump to tag?

[18:42] <jdv> will spectest work with the bumps and the rolled back moarvm

[18:42] <jdv> that is the question

[18:42] <[Coke]> I might be missing a step here. I'll ask if I get stuck going through the directions

[18:42] <[Coke]> jdv: yup, that's a good question

[18:42] <[Coke]> eh, not a big deal

[18:43] <jdv> sure.  but won't you be spectesting the wrong build at some point?

[18:44] <jdv> anyway, good luck!

[18:50] <[Coke]> ... it's not a big deasl *to fix the bumps*

[18:50] <[Coke]> so I'll do that and then make sure I'm testing the right thing.

[18:51] <[Coke]> ... Looks like a BUNCH of merges on thursday also.

[18:52] <[Coke]> ok, 2. and those both look very safe. no worries there.

[20:27] <[Coke]> Wasn't expecting to have to do multiple builds with various moarvm configs. Missed it on previous readthroughts.

[20:28] <jdv> i guess 2/22 is fine

[20:28] <jdv> i don't do multiple builds

[20:29] <jdv> i do that just with the main rakudo build parts lying around for the dsay

[20:29] <jdv> idk why you'd need to rebuild

[20:29] <[Coke]> ?

[20:30] <[Coke]> the part where it says "after recompiling..."

[20:30] <jdv> ah, that says "if possible" so its never been possible for me:)

[20:36] <[Coke]> Might just be that I'm doing this on a mac.

[20:36] <timo> [Coke]: can you set RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 to see where it's looking for the Pod.nqp precompiled file that's wrong?

[20:36] <[Coke]> if I get a clean run from someone on linux, fair play

[20:36] <timo> you may have to nuke the prefix before building stuff

[20:38] <[Coke]> timo: https://gist.github.com/coke/2057ad1132c8a59c81459b70399a928e

[20:38] <[Coke]> timo: so do a rm -rf ./install and try the whole thing again?

[20:38] <timo> does your ./install/bin/raku work at all?

[20:39] <[Coke]> That's a lot to track down this thing I can avoid by running 'make <spectest>'

[20:39] <timo> is that actually really your prefix? and you already did "make install"?

[20:39] <[Coke]> I didn't set a prefix, using the default

[20:39] <[Coke]> ... and no, ./install/bin/raku -e 'say 3' also barfs.

[20:39] <[Coke]> Lovely

[20:39] <timo> "make <spectest>" uses the not-yet-installed raku

[20:39] <[Coke]> rebuilding...

[20:39] <timo> so you can run the spectest before installing

[20:39] <timo> stop

[20:39] <jdv> sounds like a personal problem:)

[20:40] <[Coke]> whew.

[20:40] <[Coke]> I was right, that *was* a familiar error. :)

[20:40] <[Coke]> timo++

[20:41] <[Coke]> Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 4

[20:41] <[Coke]> address already in use (address: 0.0.0.0:5000)

[20:41] <timo> might still be running another instance of that test, or some random program uses port 5000 for itsefl

[20:41] <[Coke]> Guessing this is an OSX spectest issue - jdv, let me know if you have similar issues.

[20:41] <[Coke]> ah, yes ,works great with another port.

[20:42] <[Coke]> I picked '6583' at random, test passed.

[20:42] <timo> it should really use a randomized port. i think if you pass 0 as the port it's supposed to give you a random free port

[20:42] <jdv> that particular spectest works for me after just building head and full spectest running...

[20:47] <[Coke]> timo: if I change it to a literal 0, it dies in the same spot here on mac.

[20:48] <timo> with "already in use"? you would also have to change the code to ask for what exact port it did end up getting

[20:48] <[Coke]> can we close https://github.com/Raku/roast/issues/320 ?

[20:48] <[Coke]> timo: fails in *same place*, sorry

[20:56] <[Coke]> ... if you update the Planned future releases too soon, it breaks the script.

[21:15] <[Coke]> there's no step that says "add the changlog data to the release announcement - but I think that's implied by the "script is broken" step, yes?

[21:15] <[Coke]> Also: are you using 'ake' ?

[21:17] <[Coke]> (guessing so as those instructions are pretty specific)

[21:17] <jdv> yes, i use ake

[21:18] <[Coke]> ah, found the instruction I thought wasn't there about wiki, nevermind.

[21:18] <jdv> that's in the end of...yeah

[21:18] <jdv> there's plenty to fix and/or automate if anyone is interested:)

[21:19] <[Coke]> Yup, I have several tickets I'll work on in the next month or so as a result.

[21:21] <[Coke]> jdv: does "Create the release commit" just mean "all the changes so far"? I have actually been doing intermediate commits once I did the branch.

[21:21] <[Coke]> Also: do we need the "deliberately not logged" ?

[21:22] <jdv> all those changes from the release instructions typeically end up in one commit

[21:22] <jdv> if you look at the last one you'll see

[21:23] <[Coke]> ok, but that's not a requirement, I'm guessing, more stylistic? (I've already pushed a small one, can force commit to fix it if needed)

[21:23] <jdv> where is this deliberately not logged stuff?

[21:23] <[Coke]> More concerned about the "deliberately not logged"

[21:23] <[Coke]> in the commit message

[21:24] <jdv> oh, i think that's for releasable?

[21:24] <[Coke]> ah, needed by the release bot

[21:24] <[Coke]> (it's mentioned MUCH earlier in the release guide)

[21:25] <jdv> i think the assumption is that one would follow the guide unless one knew better or had a very good reason to deviate and knew what they were doing?  idk.

[21:25] <jdv> that's more or less how i've been doing it

[22:35] <[Coke]> make: src/core/args.c: Timestamp out of range; substituting 2514-05-30 01:53:03.999999999

[22:36] <timo> what on earth are you doing :D

[22:36] <[Coke]> (doing step 9 of the moarvm release - everything is still moving...)

[22:36] <[Coke]> FOLLOWING THE RELEASE GUIDE. ;)

[22:36] <timo> how novel

[22:37] <[Coke]> make: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.

[22:37] <[Coke]> drwxrwxr-x  3 azureuser azureuser     4096 Jan 25 22:34 docs

[22:37] <[Coke]> just a random line from ls -l - those dates seem fine..

[22:38] <[Coke]> my date is right...

[22:38] <timo> ah, we grabbed the files from azure build?

[22:38] <timo> of course there is more than just one date for a file

[22:39] <timo> `stat -c '%w %x %y %z' filenames`

[22:40] <[Coke]> ? I'm on my own azure box

[22:40] <[Coke]> This doesn't have anything to do with the CI buidls

[22:41] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/tags - anyone want to verify anything about that before I keep moving?

[22:43] <jdv> maybe clock or fs diffs?  you copied them over?

[22:44] *** sena_kun left
[22:44] <jdv> i can't build it:(

[22:46] <[Coke]> like, at all?

[22:46] <[Coke]> from the tag?

[22:47] <jdv> yeah.  weird.

[22:47] <jdv> can you untar your tar and it works?

[22:47] <[Coke]> I haven't pushed the tar file anywhere yet

[22:48] <[Coke]> the ones up there are autogenerated.

[22:48] <[Coke]> trying the tar.gz ..

[22:48] <timo> that is now 2025.10 rather than 2025.010?

[22:48] <[Coke]> make: *** No rule to make target `3rdparty/cmp/cmp.h', needed by `src/main.o'.  Stop.

[22:48] <[Coke]> 01

[22:48] <[Coke]> the *branches* had the extra zero for some reason

[22:49] <jdv> i can't build last month's either so not i'm a bit confused

[22:49] <[Coke]> ok, why does that tag not have the 3rd party stuff?

[22:49] <jdv> yeah, that's what release.sh does i think

[22:49] <[Coke]> nobody is using those, are they?

[22:50] <timo> yeah github doesn't put submodule contents in these "sources" tarballs

[22:50] <jdv> i'd say its ignorable as long as the tarball you gen works 

[22:50] <[Coke]> I tried 2024.05 at random - also missing 3rdparty

[22:50] <jdv> yeah, i forgot about that

[22:50] <[Coke]> ok, let me put that somewhere other than the official site.

[22:54] <[Coke]> Can someone please grant me access to push to moarvm.org?

[22:55] <[Coke]> (i'll put them in the right place but not create the announcement yet)

[22:55] <jdv> maybe hte infra guys?

[22:55] <jdv> it used to be jnthn or liz maybe

[22:56] <[Coke]> coleman, can you grant me write access to moarvm.org?

[22:56] <[Coke]> jdv: do you see "admin" or "settings" on the github repo?

[22:56] <coleman> in the server?

[22:56] <jdv> on what repo?

[22:56] <coleman> I don't have GitHub access to moarvm repo

[22:56] <[Coke]> moarvm.org

[22:57] <[Coke]> but probably not that either. :|

[22:57] <jdv> oh, right.  its just gh.  you can tell i'm awake.

[22:57] <jdv> i do not

[22:57] <[Coke]> ok. Anyone have a place I can upload these files so maybe jdv can put them in the repo?

[22:58] <[Coke]> ... I'll throw it in a github repo of my own. one sec

[22:59] <jdv> are you wanting to push to https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org? or upload the 2 files to https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/releases/tag/2025.01?

[23:00] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/moarvm.org/tree/master/releases

[23:01] <[Coke]> I was trying to upload them to moarvm.org - which I just forked.

[23:01] <[Coke]> so the 2025.01 moarvm tar and asc file are in my fork right now

[23:01] <[Coke]> If we're happy, I can do the work in my fork for the website and create a PR

[23:01] <[Coke]> (which jdv can then merge)

[23:02] <[Coke]> (waiting for ake to explode when I get there. :)

[23:03] <[Coke]> If that tar file is bad for y'all, we may have to delay a day

[23:06] <jdv> gpg: Can't check signature: No public key

[23:06] <jdv> :)

[23:07] <jdv> my tar spits out a bunch of implausibly old time stamp -9223372036854775808

[23:09] <jdv> and more datetime noise but ultimately "This is MoarVM version 2025.01 built with JIT support"

[23:10] <[Coke]> is the gpg check just because I haven't shared it with you?

[23:10] <jdv> i think its cause your key isn't on a keyserver

[23:10] <jdv> but more or less

[23:10] <[Coke]> OK. github trusts it, at least. :|

[23:11] <[Coke]> ok. so, are we OK with that level of datetime wonkiness? no doubt it will recur on the others.

[23:11] <jdv> we can try.  who knows if downstream will have real trouble.

[23:12] <[Coke]> ok. finishing up the moarvm.org stuff.

[23:12] <jdv> you can't just untar and retar to fix it?  idk.

[23:17] <[Coke]> looks like the assets on the release include a lot of stuff by default that wasn't in the last release - did you remove, e.g. MoarVM.macos-13.tar.gz

[23:17] <[Coke]> huh - no, I see them in 2024.10

[23:17] <jdv> last release the ci automation thing broke so i did it by hand, old school style

[23:18] <jdv> i think timo fixed it shortly thereafter

[23:18] <jdv> or someone did

[23:18] <jdv> you just have to add yours

[23:20] <[Coke]> What about checking the "latest release" box when uploading the assets? yes?

[23:20] <jdv> got me

[23:21] <jdv> i just upload the 2 files

[23:21] <coleman> it's good to click that for Official releases 

[23:21] <coleman> it's just metadata to distinguish from pre-releases

[23:22] <jdv> we don't do anything but official releases

[23:22] <[Coke]> so check it every time? :)

[23:22] <[Coke]> will add it to the list

[23:22] <coleman> yea, but that's what the box means

[23:22] <[Coke]> MoarVM release ... done, barring merging my PR on moarvm.org

[23:24] <[Coke]> .. .and the PR to merge the release branch back to main

[23:25] <jdv> i have to run for a while.  this is running exceptionally later than i had thought it would:(

[23:27] <[Coke]> Yup, sorry, I got a late start! :(

[23:27] <[Coke]> want me to not press the button on rakudo until you return?

[23:37] <[Coke]> coleman - upcoming step requires me to scp to trinity

[23:38] <coleman> i believe your pub key was uploaded last month 

[23:38] <[Coke]> should I be able to ssh in or just scp?

[23:39] <coleman> rsync or scp

[23:39] <[Coke]> ... I'm going to have bounce these files to my laptop from azure first, but that should work.

[23:40] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/infra/issues/59

[23:40] <coleman> That documents what I've put on the server

[23:41] <coleman> I think you can ssh as the rakudo.org user

[23:43] <[Coke]> ah, really did need to specific an explicit key

[23:43] <coleman> If you need me to upload an additional key, it's no trouble. I'd just prefer not to

[23:44] <coleman> But only to have One Less Key in the wild

[23:44] <jdv> showered.  now have to get groceries.  maybe an hour.  you're the rel mgr.  if it looks ok, go for it!

[23:45] <[Coke]> no worries, I'm good

[23:45] <[Coke]> woot

[23:45] <coleman> cool; I'll be around all night. @ me if needed

[23:45] <[Coke]> woot

[23:46] <jdv> later

[23:46] <[Coke]> ... I should have ordered delivery to hit about now.

[23:46] <coleman> ciao

[23:47] <[Coke]> nqp release tagged (will take a minute for it to show up as a release)

[23:48] <[Coke]> OHAI we need gpg2?

[23:49] <[Coke]> (easy fix)

[23:49] <timo> i think so?

[23:49] <[Coke]> I didn't need it for any of the github stuff

[23:50] <[Coke]> but Ake is calling it specifically instead of gpg

[23:51] <[Coke]> ok, working on rakudo build/test before pushing the release.

[23:51] <[Coke]> Thanks for the support, folks!
