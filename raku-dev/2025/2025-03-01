[17:35] <nine> Ah that's fixed by nuking .precomp dirs

[19:12] <lizmat> nine: looking at how enums are codegenned in RakuAST and found a weird discrepancy between the legacy and Raku gramma

[19:12] <lizmat> r: it's about "my $a = True"

[19:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 992f7417b: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable '$a' is not declared.  Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this was␤intended to be part of a signature?␤at <tmp>:1␤------> it's about "my <HERE>$a = True"␤»

[19:12] <lizmat> heh

[19:13] <lizmat> legacy QASTs to: QAST::WVal(Bool) <wanted> True

[19:13] <lizmat> raku grammar QASTs to: QAST::Var(lexical True)

[19:14] <lizmat> Is that intended?  or a bug under the rug ?

[20:47] <nine> I would say it's just a missed optimization opportunity
