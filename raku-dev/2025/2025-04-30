[12:20] <[Coke]> just tripped over https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/main/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst for something at $dayjob

[12:24] <[Coke]> one of the examples they give of a package URL for perl is pkg:cpan/DROLSKY/DateTime@1.55

[12:24] <[Coke]> or pkg:cpan/LWP::UserAgent

[20:19] <timo> https://ci.debian.net/packages/n/nqp/testing/armel/60309833/ - actual real sighting of nqp segfaulting on armel in its tests

[21:17] <[Coke]> O_o;

[21:27] <timo> what is Test.moarvm inside NQP and why does running prove with a high -j count give me the error that Test.moarvm can't be found?

[21:30] <timo> ah

[21:30] <timo> i used prove with just t/ but that also picks up files that are raku code and not nqp code

[21:40] <timo> https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=rakudo&arch=mips64el&ver=2024.09-4&stamp=1745833244&raw=0 - mips64el segfaulted while compiling Grammar.nqp here

[21:43] <timo> oh maybe it was actually the v6c.moarvm file from the bootstrap

[21:44] <timo> =========qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped

[21:44] <timo> t/nqp/113-run-command.t ................ All 8 subtests passed

[22:18] <timo> i can't make sense of this core file
