[01:43] <japhb> Fair enough ... I haven't taken a look at LSP so don't know what escape hatches it might have.

[19:35] <lizmat> PSA: it looks like irclogs.raku.org and Geth will be down on Mon 15 Sep from 0600 - 0800 UTC due to electricity works at their data center

[19:35] <lizmat> in preparation for this (having the logger run on my MBP which will be on battery and 5G) I tried to get the logger running

[19:35] <lizmat> and it didn't work

[19:36] <lizmat> with the debugging enabled, I found that it was being kicked from libera for floowing

[19:36] <lizmat> *flooding

[19:36] <lizmat> which I thought was odd, since it was the identical code of the standard logger

[19:37] <lizmat> except: I realized after a bit that this MBP is about 8x as fast as the box on which the logger runs

[19:37] <lizmat> apparently enough to get being kicked off

[19:37] <lizmat> added a .5 second delay between joining channels, (.1 was not enough), and now we appear to be in business  :-)

[19:38] <lizmat> guess I'll need to add that to IRC::Client as a feature

[20:34] <japhb> There's something joyous about the moment you have to add rate limiting to something -- "This is now so fast that *other* things can't keep up!"  :-)
