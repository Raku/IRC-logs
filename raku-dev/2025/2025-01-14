[13:42] <[Coke]> that class/role discrepenancy should eventually be caught by the check-signature test.

[13:44] <lizmat> fwiw, they may have been roles at some time in the past

[18:37] <[Coke]> lizmat: opened a Code::Coverage ticket - test failures here.

[18:52] <[Coke]> It looks like it's a dep issue, but the repo looks fine.

[18:54] <[Coke]> *repos

[19:05] <lizmat> yeah, it's something icky during testing  :-(

[19:05] <lizmat> but only during testing, and only if some of the deps aren't installed yet

[19:49] <lizmat> ugexe: off the top of your mind, does $*REPO gets set for staging repositories during testing ?

[19:49] <lizmat> if not, what would be the way to find out what the head of the repo-chain is ?

[19:49] <lizmat> during testing with a dependency in a staging repo

[20:19] <ugexe> when you say during testing, you mean the testing phase of `zef install ...` or `zef test ...`? The later does not use staging at all. for `zef install ...` the test command is invoked with -I /path/to/staging/repo

[20:19] <ugexe> [zef] Command: /Users/nlogan/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.09/install/bin/rakudo -I CompUnit::Repository::Staging#name(site)#/var/folders/cw/bq4j08yx3wq5b3dvz_s4ygb80000gn/T/.zef.1736885886.80166/1736885886.80166.4174.220434103438 t/00-load.rakutest

[20:19] <ugexe> if you run zef install with --debug you'd see a command like the one above

[20:22] <lizmat> when the user runs "zef install foo"

[20:22] <timo> during testing of the module when zef does the install?

[20:22] <lizmat> yes
