[13:57] <ab5tract> nine: getting closer at least

[14:09] <tbrowder> Too (our most vocal Raku Windows use) just has mentioned he see no refernce to fixing UNC paths for Windows. looking at the trail of changes and fixes is confusing to me, but can anyone

[14:10] *** finanalyst left
[14:10] <tbrowder> answer whether it is supposed to be fixed?

[14:12] <tbrowder> the user is Todd

[14:13] <tbrowder> on perl6 mailing list

[14:13] <jdv> i just randomly read a rant about go's windows fs support which apparantly is terrible so its not just raku;)

[14:15] <ab5tract> nine: weirdly, the pair of exceptions seems to trigger for $resolver.add-worry but not for $resolver.add-sorry

[14:15] <ab5tract> both are being used to produce the same exception

[14:19] <ab5tract> I don't have the tuits for it right now, unfortunately, so I'll just make it a sorry instead

[14:38] <Xliff> So I'm just trying to execute some RakuAST nodes, and I'm getting the following error: Unknown compilation input 'qast'. What does that mean?

[14:38] <Xliff> Right now it's just a bunch of RakuAST::Statement::Need nodes and a BEGIN block

[17:20] <ab5tract> Xliff: I can’t be much help right now but I don’t think anyone can get far without seeing the code

[17:22] <[Coke]> (or maybe a dd of the objects to execute)

[17:28] <ab5tract> Also it’s not clear what “execute” means here. Are you eval’ing then?
