[19:02] <nine> Is there any progress on make install with RakuAST?

[19:51] <[Coke]> Haven't seen any; nine, should bootstrap-rakuast build? (just tried a checkout, it was happy with the existing nqp/moar, but then died with An exception X::Comp::AdHoc occurred while evaluating a BEGIN:

[19:51] <[Coke]> (before install)

[19:53] <[Coke]> (during build)

[19:54] <[Coke]> nuking nqp/moar, trying again

[20:06] <timo> how long do i run nqp tests in serial to figure out if maybe the segfault happens only if nqps are run in parallel ...

[20:13] <nine> [Coke]: I see a similar failure here

[20:16] <[Coke]> timo: it's using prove, right? TEST_JOBS=1

[20:17] <nine> [Coke]: oh, sorry, false alarm. Build went fine. You are running it with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 make, right?

[20:19] <timo> i'm using -j1

[20:21] <[Coke]> nine: ah, no, I wrongly assumed it was defaulted on in the branch. my bad.

[20:22] <[Coke]> timo: that should do it (if you're running prove and not 'make test')

[20:43] <timo> yeah, that's what i'm doing

[20:43] <timo> the question was something else though

[20:59] <timo> hm, i don't actually have like a counter running though

[21:43] *** finanalyst left
[22:01] <timo> hum. but it also crashed compiling a part of Rakudo during its build. and that's not very multithreaded right? so maybe parallelism can't be the cause, only make it more likely to show for some reason?

[22:02] <timo> but also that was on mipsel rather than armel i think

[23:00] <timo> i'll let it go over night just to be sure â€¦
