[00:04] <[Coke]> what else is on there that wasn't rejected?

[00:04] <[Coke]> We can at least call it out in a comment at the end.

[00:05] <timo> i might have not read it carefully enough

[00:09] <[Coke]> this is probably why it's still open. :)

[00:09] <[Coke]> it's hard to get through. :)

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Re-imagine Array.clone once again

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: It occured to me that in most use cases, an array to be cloned will

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: be one without a todo (aka, fully reified).  This commit fast paths

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: that case, by splitting off the handling of lazy (with todo) arrays

[11:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: into a separate private method.
