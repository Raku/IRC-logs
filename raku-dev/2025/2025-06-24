[20:57] <[Coke]> who has access to the rakudo dockerhub org?

[20:58] <[Coke]> I hesitate to even update it if it's the one that jdv has working 

[20:58] <[Coke]> jdv, you and I are probably running VERY different versions of blin

[20:59] <[Coke]> :(

[21:04] <jdv> sure.  but meaningfully different?

[21:05] <jdv> my blin is 17 months old it looks like

[21:05] <jdv> i'm attempting to build a new image

[21:06] <jdv> #12 ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c cd /Blin && zef install --verbose --deps-only ." did not complete successfully: exit code: 1

[21:06] <[Coke]> the docker image is from 2019, as is the raku in the container.

[21:06] <jdv> so familiar and disappointing *sigh*

[21:07] <jdv> the raku in the image is just used to run blin and zef really

[21:07] <[Coke]> might even get a speed boost just from the upgrade.

[21:07] <jdv> you mean the image on dockerhub or somewhere public?

[21:07] <jdv> i've always had a locally built one so i'm not sure about that if so

[21:07] <[Coke]> (just) true

[21:08] <[Coke]> dockerhub image

[21:08] <[Coke]> I can't use the entrypoint (failure mode in ticket), but I can start a shell inside and poke around

[21:08] <jdv> nice.  2019.  that image doesn't even know covid!

[21:09] <jdv> let me get it working again.  and i'll get back to you.  some dep rotted i guess again:(

[21:10] <[Coke]> It's working for me at HEAD outside of docker, fwiw.

[21:12] <jdv> cool.  i just don't want all those packages and nonsense on my box.

[21:13] <jdv> i guess i could run it in a real vm but docker is kinda more convenient:)

[21:14] <jdv> looks like i hit the classic "Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol SSL"

[21:14] <jdv> i thought we fixed that a long time ago

[21:14] <jdv> but i gotta make dinner and such so maybe later this week i can pick this up again

[21:54] <[Coke]> kk

[21:54] <[Coke]> ok
