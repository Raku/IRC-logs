[03:48] <japhb> nwc10: Can you explain the reasoning behind c9d69dc658 ?  My gut reaction would have been to go the opposite direction and fix the MoarVM ops so that they used the C library functions -- which might be using intrinsics or specially coded to maintain numerical stability or what have you.

[03:48] <linkable6> (2020-12-30) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/c9d69dc658 Implement `sec`, `asec` and `sech` in terms of other NQP trigonometric funcs.

[06:36] <nwc10> japhb: there aren't C library intrinsics for any of those functions. MoarVM is just doing the same 

[06:36] <nwc10> same floating point arithmetic operations (plural), but from C
