[12:06] <patrickb> Just found a mention of Raku and Parrot in the english Wikipedia that probably wants an update.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser Third paragraph under "Relationship to other parsers". I don't have enough knowledge of our formal parser stack to know how the current state of affairs is.

[12:07] <patrickb> ^ ping lizmat (maybe?)

[12:07] <lizmat> I think moritz would be the one to answer / fix

[12:08] <lizmat> I'm still at: You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia due to a block affecting this IP address.

[12:08] <lizmat> meh

[12:20] <patrickb> tyil: Request for review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/pull/64

[12:21] <moritz> I've removed the sentence about parrot

[12:21] <moritz> the rest is accurate enough that I don't want quibble about it

[12:22] <patrickb> moritz++

[12:25] <tyil> patrickb++

[12:25] <tyil> that looks good to me

[15:08] <softmoth> Hi! I'm looking for more user testing on rakudoc, if anyone has a few minutes to try it and let me know how it works for you:  zef update; zef install rakudoc --verbose

[15:10] <sena_kun> softmoth, [rakudoc]     # expected a match with: / '/site' .* 'IO::MiddleMan' /

[15:10] <sena_kun> [rakudoc]     #                   got: "Doc /home/koto/.zef/store/perl6-IO-MiddleMan.git/ec882a8ef0d74df1297838c877a279bf06557a44 IO::MiddleMan"

[15:11] <sena_kun> [rakudoc]     # expected a match with: / ^ 'unit class IO::MiddleMan' /

[15:11] <sena_kun> [rakudoc]     #                   got: "\n"

[15:13] <softmoth> sena_kun, thank you, that test case is brittle, then. if you --/test, does using it work OK?

[15:14] <sena_kun> softmoth, skipping tests makes it install

[15:15] <sena_kun> softmoth, how can I use it? :)

[15:15] <softmoth> :)

[15:15] <softmoth> rakudoc -h gives some examples

[15:15] <sena_kun> things like `rakudoc Map` prints `No results for 'Map'`

[15:15] <sena_kun> same for `rakudoc -D Map`

[15:16] <sena_kun> Do I need doc clone to point rakudoc to?

[15:16] <softmoth> Do you have doc repo anywhere? I guess this is the big problem to solve. Raku/doc is monolithic and needs to be broken up so that just the doc can be depended on, otherwise it's too hard to install

[15:17] <softmoth> Yes, if you have it cloned you can use RAKUDOC=/path/to/doc/doc (or rakudoc -d=/path/to/doc/doc)

[15:17] <softmoth> It should find installed modules, too, e.g. "rakudoc JSON::Fast"

[15:18] <sena_kun> softmoth, `rakudoc -d=doc Map` works, `rakudoc -d=doc .add` does not, `rakudoc JSON::Fast` works

[15:18] <softmoth> "rakudoc .ACCEPTS" should return a bunch of results once docs are in place, but you have to run "rakudoc -b" first to build the index

[15:19] <softmoth> Thanks for your help

[15:19] <sena_kun> softmoth, the issue with doc repo dependencies is that it is coupled with a website generation code, which should not be so. Alas, there are certain difficulties ongoing with making it the other way.

[15:20] <sena_kun> softmoth, how much do you control indexing code? Is it possible to add a progress bar? That'd be cool.

[15:20] <softmoth> Yes, progress bar is possible.

[15:21] <softmoth> The first time it takes a while; subsequent updates are pretty quick

[15:21] <softmoth> So more feedback during that process would be appreciated; good to know

[15:22] <sena_kun> still indexes

[15:22] <softmoth> On my old laptop it takes ~8 minutes....

[15:23] <sena_kun> softmoth, `.add` works now

[15:23] <sena_kun> re-indexing is quick

[15:23] <softmoth> Subsequent run takes ~15 seconds. So almost all of that time is in Raku precompilation

[15:24] <softmoth> Since re-indexing is still doing all of the same work once it gets the $=pod from the precomp cache

[15:25] <softmoth> OK, so basic functionality works, but the packaging is extremely unfriendly.
