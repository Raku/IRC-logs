[15:20] <sena_kun> A changelog is ready for anyone to review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[15:33] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: i'm impressed every time. just one thing, not sure exactly what is being said here `Module installing at sorting now prefers API sorting over version sorting [43613ac5]`

[15:44] <MasterDuke> maybe some thing like "Module sorting when installing prefers API over version"?

[19:58] <El_Che> hi, regarding https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/kz78y2/running_as_a_service_under_an_unprivileged_user/

[19:58] <El_Che> I wonder if it's related to my latest rakudo-pkg (I didn't see it before) or something upstream in 2020.12

[19:59] <El_Che> you guys discussed it here: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku-dev?date=2021-01-17#l77

[20:01] <El_Che> I run "raku t/*rakutest"in the module root once and got "Failed to create directory '/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/short' with mode '0o777': Failed to mkdir: Permission denied in any statement_control at /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/../share/perl6/lib/Perl6/Grammar.moarvm line 1"

[20:01] <El_Che> next time I ran it, the error was gone

[20:02] <El_Che> oh, it's back :)

[20:02] <El_Che> intermittent 1 out of 5, that's ugly :)

[20:09] <El_Che> it seems to be gone ones I deleted ~/.perl6 and ~/.raku

[20:48] <sena_kun> Took me just so long to fix the roast with this hardware. :(

[20:48] <sena_kun> Now that's a question if I want to do builds now or not.

[21:12] <dogbert11> sena_kun: nine is hunting a GC issue in #moarvm

[21:18] <sena_kun> dogbert11, is it a blocker?

[21:18] <sena_kun> Is it a recent regression?

[21:24] <sena_kun> El_Che, sorry?

[21:25] <El_Che> you can build random commits on github instead of locally

[21:27] <dogbert11> sena_kun: seems to be are very old bug

[21:28] <sena_kun> dogbert11, I would rather release now instead of introducing something the last minute.

[21:28] <dogbert11> I'm not against that :) just wanted to let you know

[21:29] <sena_kun> dogbert11, no problem, thanks for letting me know and a tireless hunt for bugs. :)
