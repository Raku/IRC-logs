[08:14] <[Tux]> @moritz, not really, it was my comment to Liz, and I didn't know how to word that better in English :)

[08:17] <moritz> [Tux]: ok. I feel like I *almost* understand it, with my mixture of German and Norwegian :-)

[08:18] <[Tux]> in short: we were positively surprised with these relatively low numbers (fast timing)

[08:18] <[Tux]> but there is still enough room for improvement

[08:20] <nwc10> yes, that does sound clunky expressed in English. I assume that it sounds far more elegant in Dutch, but I have no way to tell that
