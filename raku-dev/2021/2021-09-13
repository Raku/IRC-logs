[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: don't use 'directives' feature, its expensive when unused

[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: 

[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: when directives is set, a dynamic variable is looked up, but

[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: in neither nqp nor rakudo it is ever set on the moarvm backend.

[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: 

[22:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp/new-disp: Not finding the variable is measurably extremely expensive.
