[16:55] <jdv> can someone get me a commit bit on the rakudo repo?

[16:57] <jdv> rba: the release guide says to contact you about how to get the release files uploaded 

[17:01] <Altai-man> jdv, what's your github nickname?

[17:01] <Altai-man> jdv, can you please clarify where is it noted (about uploading the files) exactly?

[17:06] <[Coke]> I have jdv's CLA, it's safe to add him to the repo.

[17:14] <Altai-man> [Coke]++

[17:44] <[Coke]> I was going to add it, but I see there's groups involved and didn't want to put him in the wrong place - but I'll add him directly by end of day if needed, someone can clean it up after if needed.

[18:04] <jdv> sorry - distracted

[18:05] <jdv> uploading... step 19 of https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod i think

[18:06] <jdv> Altai-man: ^

[18:08] <Altai-man> jdv, aha, I see, you're right.

[18:08] <Altai-man> jdv, give you write privs to the rakudo repo.

[18:08] <Altai-man> s/give/gave/

[18:12] <jdv> i guess i also need creds for this no?: https://dev.azure.com/rakudo/rakudo/_build?definitionId=1&_a=summary

[18:12] <jdv> so many pieces...

[18:13] <Altai-man> jdv, you should have them if you're logged in? And I'd suggest to rely on someone else to do binary releases.

[18:14] <jdv> ah, sso, right

[18:14] <jdv> who normally does them?

[18:15] <Altai-man> jdv, patrickbkr++ AFAIK.

[18:18] <jdv> ok, cool

[18:22] <releasable6> jdv, Details: https://gist.github.com/276ff1a9546a6ed9ef8fad39be6b241a
