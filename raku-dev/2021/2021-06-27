[10:42] <gfldex> Is there any timeline for v6.d -> v6.e?

[10:43] <gfldex> (I kinda need v6.e right now!)

[10:57] <lizmat> use v6.*  :-)

[10:58] <lizmat> seriously though, we need newdisp and rakuast to land first 

[10:58] <lizmat> I would say Q4 2021 at the earliest, probably Q1 2022

[11:32] <sena_kun> lizmat, ping?

[19:36] <MasterDuke> should `./rakudo-m -I lib -e 'use Test; use Nativecall'` in the rakudo repo directory take the same amount of time as `$PREFIX/rakudo-m -e 'use Test; use Nativecall'`?

[21:53] <gfldex> Should `raku -M AnyModule -e 'use v6.*; your-code-here()'` work?

[21:53] <gfldex> Right now I get "Too late to switch language version. Must be used as the very first statement.".
