[02:38] <tellable6> 2021-02-05T08:22:40Z #raku <jmerelo> Xliff I'm sure finanalyst does not mind. Please add yourself as a mentor, if you want making a reference to @finanalyst so that he knows.

[02:38] <Xliff> jnthn, sena-kun: What's the best way to have a route alias another route in Cro::HTTP::Router?

[02:40] <Xliff> For example, I want the default route for my service to be /this/month, so that a call to 'http://my,webserve/' is functionally the same as 'http:/my.webserv/this/month'

[02:40] <Xliff> How can I do that with Cro::HTTP::Router?

[13:05] <moritz> .tell xliff you can simply have the handler be a function, and call that in two routes: get -> '' { your_handler() }; get -> 'this', 'month' { your_handler };

[13:05] <tellable6> moritz, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[13:05] <moritz> .tell Xliff maybe you can also use a junction for the path, haven't tried that though
