[13:13] <AlexDaniel`> can somebody from IRC tell me if *able6 bots are connected through ipv4 or ipv6 addresses?

[13:16] <AlexDaniel`> I guess ipv6

[13:16] <AlexDaniel`> right?

[13:29] <lizmat> I"m not sure Freenode even does IPv6

[13:34] <raydiak> they do seem to be connecting from IPv6 addresses: "evalable6 (~eva-able@2001:41d0:2:5eb5::) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)"

[13:40] <AlexDaniel`> I see, thanks

[13:55] <AlexDaniel`> OK, now that probably looks right

[13:55] <AlexDaniel`> (bots coming from both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses)

[13:55] <raydiak> now it appears that some of them are on IPv4, others on IPv6

[13:55] <AlexDaniel`> yeah, good! Thanks!

[13:56] <AlexDaniel`> so I think I fixed the issue with some bots not rejoining ðŸ˜Š

[13:56] *** shareable6 joined
[13:56] *** tellable6 joined
[13:57] <raydiak> nice! what was the cause, ooc?

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> well, there are many bots, and freenode has a limit of 10 per IP I think. So years ago I came up with this really quick workaround that worked for a looong time:

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> :host(%*ENV<TESTABLE> ?? â€˜127.0.0.1â€™ !! <chat.freenode.net 84.17.44.180>.pick)

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> look at the .pick part. The server is ipv6-capable, so it connects using ipv6 by default

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> and the ipv4 address is of some specific freenode server I think

[14:01] <raydiak> ah, I see

[14:01] <AlexDaniel`> my best guess is that that IP is no longer there doing its freenode thing, and you're not supposed to connect to specific servers anyway

[14:01] <AlexDaniel`> changed the IP, hopefully will last a few more years :)

[18:48] <MasterDuke> [Coke]: in a powershell command prompt, from your rakudo directory, can you run `prove -j2 -e '../install/bin/raku' -vlr t`?

[18:49] <MasterDuke> hm, you might not have it installed in a place where you need the initial '..', but i think that's whats breaking

[18:50] <MasterDuke> it might not matter, maybe just running prove with any random path starting with '..' will have the same problem i'm seeing

[18:50] <MasterDuke> but it's in azure, and i'm not 100% sure where the problem is occuring

[22:41] <MasterDuke> i'd combined jobs and accidentally left in the only-do-this-if-os-is-not-windows conditional to build rakudo. so i was using what should/would be the correct paths, but it was also correctly complaining that nothing was there
