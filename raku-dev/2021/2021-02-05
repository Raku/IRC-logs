[15:43] <Altai-man_> Can anyone please help me with reproducing a blin bug?

[15:58] <patrickb> Altai-man_: o/

[15:58] <patrickb> what can I do?

[16:52] *** b2gills left
[16:53] <Altai-man_> patrickb, git clone https://github.com/Raku/Blin.git; cd Blin/docker; ./dblin --nproc=$num-of-threads Cro::TLS;

[16:54] <Altai-man_> patrickb, then you do `cat /var/tmp/Blin-volume/Blin/output/data.json | grep backend`

[16:55] <patrickb> what's a good thread num?

[16:56] <Altai-man_> patrickb, like e.g. TEST_JOBS you usually set.

[16:57] <patrickb> do I have to install docker or does it work with podman equally well?

[16:57] <Altai-man_> patrickb, I am afraid you will need to install docker, though I am underqualified to answer this question. Maybe it will work equally well, no idea. :(

[17:00] <patrickb> back in a sec. Relogin to activate new group membership

[17:00] *** patrickb left

[17:06] <patrickb> running

[17:16] <patrickb> docker failed on the first try

[17:18] <patrickb> docker failed on the first try  (probably a too new linux kernen for the old docker version I had lying around). Now running with podman. Looking good so far.

[17:24] <patrickb> https://paste.sr.ht/~patrickb/17a23713b65b137fbadd330aae8cf47453afac23

[17:25] <patrickb> Altai-man: ^

[17:26] <Altai-man_> No installing backend available

[17:26] <Altai-man_> Yeah, that's the same thing I am seeing on all machines.

[17:27] <patrickb> containers tend to be rather reproducible...

[17:27] <Altai-man_> ugexe has speculated it might be related to a precomp issue, but I am afraid this is something far bigger and noticeable.

[17:27] <Altai-man_> patrickb, well, yes, but I used this container to do a year of loose releases and it was just fine. Then one morning it went boom.

[17:28] <[Coke]> same error in this ticket: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/issues/61

[17:28] <tellable6> 2021-02-05T08:13:41Z #raku <PimDaniel> Coke Thank's Coke. That's what i wanted! I saw .WHO into the reference but used it : THIS.WHO and it gave me nothing i could handle, i must still look at the Classes hierarchy to understand. Merci Bien!

[17:29] <[Coke]> which was fixed by nuking a potentially stale zef config, it seems.

[17:30] <patrickb> Altai-man: Did you already try debugging it the boring way?

[17:30] <Altai-man_> Alas, I did a completely removal of everything related to zef and still the same result, plus reproducible. I think it is a different issue leading to the same error message.

[17:30] <Altai-man_> patrickb, which one?

[17:30] <Altai-man_> I will be grateful for any clues on what to do with this at this moment.

[17:31] <patrickb> The "no installing backend" thing is an error message of zef. I'd just put some `say`s in the installer backend you expect to work

[17:32] <Altai-man_> Interesting. I'll try to give it a shot after $dayjob.

[17:33] <patrickb> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Install.rakumod#L88

[17:34] <patrickb> Do you know that you can run a shell in any container / image?

[17:35] <patrickb> `docker exec -it some-image-or-container /bin/bash`

[17:35] <patrickb> makes it easy to look at things only happening in a container.

[17:39] <patrickb> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Install.rakumod#L88

[17:40] <patrickb> The one install pluggin there is always returns True

[17:40] <patrickb> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/eedccd493ef464447aa6470af479f673987756ef/lib/Zef/Service/InstallRakuDistribution.rakumod#L69

[17:48] <ugexe> the install plugin was renamed from InstallPM6.pm6 to InstallRakuMod.rakumod or some such

[17:48] <tellable6> 2021-02-03T12:47:04Z #raku <Xliff> ugexe: Well, by doing so, you are saying you are unwilling to be involved in the solution.

[17:48] <ugexe> so a stale config pointing at the old name would seem a likely culprit

[17:48] <patrickb> just reading the very diff of that commit :-P

[17:49] <patrickb> I'll have a look at that config in the container

[17:59] *** b2gills joined
[18:00] <ugexe> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/99e3335fa955db0e44cc86601882ca8302eabd26/lib/Blin/Tester/Zef.rakumod#L63

[18:00] <ugexe> note that it uses a custom config file

[18:01] <Altai-man_> And this is it.

[18:02] <Altai-man_> let's see

[18:02] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/99e3335fa955db0e44cc86601882ca8302eabd26/lib/Blin/Tester/Zef.rakumod#L30

[18:03] *** domidumont left
[18:08] *** MasterDuke joined
[18:11] <patrickb> the zef in my container has '"module": "Zef::Service::InstallPM6"'

[18:12] <Altai-man_> But it is clonned afresh and its taken from its config, https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/99e3335fa955db0e44cc86601882ca8302eabd26/lib/Blin/Tester/Zef.rakumod#L21 and https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/99e3335fa955db0e44cc86601882ca8302eabd26/lib/Blin/Tester/Zef.rakumod#L26

[18:13] <patrickb> the config is slurped from /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/core/resources/FA169EDDE5EBF3101385048BCCB7B37EC54A5227.json

[18:13] <patrickb> (that's what `zef --help` outputs)

[18:14] <patrickb> that file also still has 

[18:14] <patrickb> InstallPM6

[18:14] <Altai-man_> buster-slim debian has too old zef packed in then.

[18:15] <patrickb> blin clones it's own zef

[18:15] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/99e3335fa955db0e44cc86601882ca8302eabd26/lib/Blin/Tester/Zef.rakumod#L21

[18:17] <patrickb> the problem is that zef is not installed. Blin just runs zef-checkout/bin/zef --help

[18:18] <patrickb> that then uses accesses the config of the already installed zef

[18:18] <patrickb> which is then read, modified, written and used by blin

[18:18] <ugexe> yeah it needs to be installed, or at least passed -I $!binary.parent(2)

[18:19] <patrickb> why not just install it as intended?

[18:20] <patrickb> need to go shopping. Back in a bit. But I guess the mystery is solved. \o/

[18:20] <Altai-man_> patrickb, ugexe thank you very much for the investigation!
