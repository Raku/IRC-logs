[08:05] <AlexDaniel`> my sense of smell is back! Geez this world is so smelly xD

[08:06] <AlexDaniel`> it has been a little less than a month I think since I lost it

[08:22] <moritz> wow, that sucks. Glad you have it back

[08:31] <AlexDaniel`> could've been worse. The person I got it from still has cough

[08:42] <moritz> could've been worse, people have died from it. Still sucks.

[21:22] <lizmat> ok, this is weird?

[21:22] <lizmat> m: $_ = 0; say $_; 5 ~~ 42[say $_]

[21:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «0␤5␤»

[21:22] <lizmat> so, inside the postcircumfix, $_ is set to the value left of the smartmatch

[21:22] <lizmat> m: $_ = 0; say $_; 5 ~~ 42[say $_]; say $_

[21:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «0␤5␤0␤»

[21:46] *** domidumont left
[21:57] <vrurg> lizmat: I'd say it's explainable but confusing. 

[22:00] <lizmat> explainable how ?

[22:01] <lucasb> m: 5 ~~ .say

[22:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «5␤»

[22:03] <lucasb> I think $_ is meant to be bound to the LHS of the ~~, as it is

[22:05] <lucasb> "The smartmatch operator aliases the left-hand side to $_"  https://docs.raku.org/routine/~~

[22:05] *** sena_kun left
[22:06] <lizmat> TIL  :-)

[22:52] <vrurg> lizmat: the doc says it all. But it doesn't change the fact that it's confusing. :)

[22:52] <vrurg> Sometimes.

[22:53] <lizmat> I wonder what the rationale is for that behaviour

[22:53] <vrurg> m: 5 ~~ { .defined && .Str.length == 1 }

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «No such method 'length' for invocant of type 'Str'.  Did you mean any␤of these: 'chars', 'codes'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:54] <vrurg> m: say 5 ~~ { .defined && .Str.chars == 1 }

[22:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[22:54] <lizmat> you can drop the .Str there, but yeah ok

[22:54] <vrurg> For something like this, I think. Though in this case LHS could be passed as an argument

[22:55] <lizmat> indeed...

[22:56] <vrurg> m: my %h = a=>1, b=>2; say "a" ~~ %h{$_}:exists

[22:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤You can't adverb ~~␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3h = a=>1, b=>2; say "a" ~~ %h{$_}:exists7⏏5<EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        pair value␤»

[22:56] <vrurg> m: my %h = a=>1, b=>2; say "a" ~~ (%h{$_}:exists)

[22:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[22:56] <tobs> I was about to comment that it also makes `$string ~~ s///` work, but it doesn't seem to (on my old rakudo):

[22:57] <lizmat> sleep&

[22:57] <tobs> m: my $s = "test"; $s ~~ s[\w] = .uc; say $s

[22:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «TESTest␤»

[22:57] <vrurg> lizmat: good night!

[22:57] <tobs> hmm, or am I using that wrong?

[22:58] <tobs> yep

[22:58] <tobs> m: my $s = "test"; $s ~~ s[\w] = $/.uc; say $s

[22:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «Test␤»

[22:58] <tobs> m: my $s = "test"; $s ~~ s:g[\w] = $/.uc; say $s

[22:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927fa332c: OUTPUT: «TEST␤»

[22:59] <tobs> so there's that, ~~ in place of p5's =~

[23:00] <vrurg> tobs: I'd better not use such constructs in real life. :)
