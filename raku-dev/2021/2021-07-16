[14:23] <patrickb> I have two Gimp image files, the backgrounds of the new Windows installer. Together they are roughly 900kb in size. Should I add them to te rakudo repo or leave them out?
[14:31] <sena_kun> patrickb, better to be a separate repo IMO?
[14:31] <sena_kun> https://github.com/Raku/marketing is maybe not the right place...
[14:32] <sena_kun> patrickb, note as we build an image for every commit the additional weight may be not so desired
[14:33] <patrickb> The images are specific to the installer, so no generic marketing resources. But it might be the practical solution.
[14:33] <patrickb> That's why I asked. ;-)
[14:34] <sena_kun> patrickb, we can pull them during building installers from some other repo. I agree marketing is not exactly that, just pointing out possible direction.

[15:29] <sena_kun> This run started on 2021-07-16T15:28:25Z and finished in 43 minutes.
[15:29] <patrickb> but then the release stuff should stay in sync with rakudo itself. So maybe it's best to just keep it there...

[21:32] <ugexe> maybe creating a file isn't sufficient and it needs to create a directory?
[21:32] <ugexe> just a wild guess
[21:32] <patrickb> Is C:\projects\foo writable?
[21:33] <patrickb> That worked before I assume?
[21:33] <ugexe> it worked before, yes
[21:34] <patrickb> There is nothing special about that folder, right? Then why should the probing fail? Wait, does that folder possibly simply doesn't exist yet?
[21:35] <ugexe> it would get created by CURI i believe
[21:37] <ugexe> yeah im confused... doesnt seem like it should happen
[21:37] <patrickb> That check is in install(). If no prior call to can-install() happens that error could actually be explained.
[21:38] <patrickb> Because writeable-path() does not try to create the folder if it doesn't exist.
[21:38] <ugexe> yeah i guess there would be no prior call in that zef example because it doesnt use `auto`, it explicitly overrides that with -to=inst#foo sp yeah
[21:39] <patrickb> Wait. No, that's not true. It's the private !writeable-path() that is called. That one does actually call can-install()
[21:40] *** melezhik joined
[21:40] <ugexe> oh in that appveyor output it shows that message twice

[21:54] <patrickb> that foo folder actually does not exist prior to trying to install to it, IIUC.
[21:54] <ugexe> right
[21:56] <ugexe> self!prefix-writeable || ?(!$.prefix.e && try { $.prefix.mkdir } && $.prefix.e);
[21:56] <ugexe> presumably it doesnt reach the mkdir there
[21:56] <ugexe> anymore
[21:56] <patrickb> I know
[21:56] <patrickb> the thing caches
[21:57] <patrickb> the very first time when the dir doesn't exist it remembers the failure
[21:58] <ugexe> self!prefix-writeable is cached, and if its caching a failure i would expect the above to fall into the rhs of the ||
[22:00] <patrickb> Right
[22:05] <patrickb> But still.
[22:06] <patrickb> The negative test is cached and the dir is created afterwards. All following calls will return False.
[22:07] <patrickb> Because the writability test fails and the test for non-existance fails as well.
[22:07] <ugexe> maybe s{//=}{||=}
[22:08] <patrickb> Ha! I had the same idea!
[22:10] <patrickb> Having the check for writability before the check of existence is a performance optimization for the common path of the repo existing, correct?
[22:13] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/495ef47794506d262804839ffd9a360af1b0fcb7
[22:13] <ugexe> that being said i dont remember exactly why
