[08:33] <nine> Ok, that blocker was already fixed in MoarVM. All that's needed there is a MoarVM bump. Which is held up by the build issue. But that is probably not that hard to fix either

[09:52] <samcv> heads up everyone. We should probably have this test done for all encodings... but i only wrote it for the shiftjis encoder. It could be generalized to work for any encoding. I am not sure if we have any tests which run all encodings through a bunch of similar tests?
[09:52] <tellable6> 2021-05-28T19:55:45Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> samcv if we can close https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2337 now.
[09:54] <samcv> [Coke], i closed that issue. Pretty sure it's done. In any case I will update Unicode version hopefully soon.
