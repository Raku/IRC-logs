[20:54] <japhb> I'm getting something weird trying to rebuild everything with the new release.  MoarVM, NQP, and Rakudo all build fine, and the loop I have around zef gets partway through its installs before failing tests for modules that haven't even been touched in a while.  Rearranging the install lists results in a different module failing its tests, but weirdly, somewhere close to the same number of modules through 

[20:54] <japhb> the list.

[20:55] <japhb> I'm not even sure what would cause something like that.  Broken data structure only noticed when it gets big enough?  Something wrong with directory handling?  I dunno.

[20:55] <japhb> Note that I am installing each module with a *separate* `zef install` command, not all at once.

[20:57] <japhb> Fails so far include MIME::Base64 and File::Directory::Tree, neither of which has changed in quite a while.

[20:57] <japhb> (These tests are on Linux Mint/x64)
