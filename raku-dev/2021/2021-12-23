[18:51] <sena_kun> jdv, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/compare/release-2021.21#diff-4f3c36daed639317c712db5e7303c431da7680c9e3a51fe0f0c6d1b1197e4bd4R127 <- this is wrong.

[18:51] <sena_kun> it's not a big deal, but while we're at it I'd git fixup the commit and force push to the branch.

[18:53] <jdv> besides the branch name being wrong is there something else?

[18:53] <sena_kun> jdv, it says "next release is scheduled to be $current-date", not January one.

[18:53] <sena_kun> in the announcement

[18:54] <jdv> oh. bla.

[18:54] * lizmat remembers having made that same mistake a few years ago  :-)

[18:55] * sena_kun did it multiple times

[18:58] <jdv> i'm new.  there's a lot:)

[18:58] <jdv> i guess i'll update the bit about upcoming releases in 21 to 22 too

[19:30] <jdv> the rakudo-test ake step failed on the same test i hit before - t/spec/S12-construction/destruction.t

[19:31] <jdv> its fine if it "flaps" that hard?

[19:39] <nine> Flappers are never fine

[19:44] <jdv> doesn't seem like a flapper to me but i see 2 different errors and can't get it to pass after many runs

[19:45] <jdv> here's the 2 i'm seeing - https://gist.github.com/jdv/ad4407e1a27d1c779d80affc3b97f5bd

[19:51] <nine> I've seen it fail for a while as well, but currently it passes for me

[19:59] <MasterDuke> i'm getting roughly 1 fail in 5 when run by itself

[20:00] <MasterDuke> oh, that's the one that was modified recently

[20:00] <jdv> so far nothing else is failing but its 100% for me

[21:25] <jdv> i've done everything up to that.  and the only steps after that are an announce on rakudo.org and the wikipedia edit

[21:26] <jdv> oh right, i didn't merge and delete the rakudo release branch

[21:28] * lizmat pulls, builds, tests  and is happy  :-)

[21:29] <jdv> ok, now what i just said is righter

[21:29] <jdv> does anyone know if that's correct - patrick (i forget his nick and its not autocompleting) is the one who does the binary release building?

[21:32] <lizmat> Patrick Böker

[21:34] <jdv> i'll just finish my bits and the binary builds can happen after

[21:34] <rba> lizmat: ok if I add the ssh key to the rakudo.org use on the server?

[21:34] <jdv> lizmat: you could merge https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/pull/76 ?

[21:35] <rba> lizmat: for jdv

[21:35] <jdv> rba if you're talking about me nine added my key to some server earlier

[21:42] <lizmat> jdv: you've earned it!

[21:42] <lizmat> kudos!

[21:44] <sena_kun> erm, was the release completed or is something deferred?

[21:45] <sena_kun> because we have https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/VERSION and it is not ok

[21:45] <sena_kun> the nqp one is done though

[21:46] <sena_kun> oh, I see it at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/951af2c2e0806038ff28a25a05ee2389d1283693

[21:46] <sena_kun> it should be properly resolved

[21:46] <lizmat> fwiw, make spectest is clean

[21:46] <lizmat> $ git describe

[21:46] <lizmat> 2021.10-159-g92b2c1588

[21:46] <lizmat> that feels... wrong ?

[21:47] <jdv> something went wrong?

[21:47] <lizmat> VERSION is still at 2021.10  :-(

[21:48] <sena_kun> I don't know how, but https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/951af2c2e0806038ff28a25a05ee2389d1283693 did not make it into master branch and the tarball was not build with this commit.

[21:48] <sena_kun> I see this PR - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4683

[21:48] <jdv> hold on. i'll fix it...

[21:49] <sena_kun> it has the commit and it looks like a completely normal PR to me, something to make a build from this branch and then merge it into master, why is it closed?

[21:50] <jdv> the correct VERSION file is in the tarball

[21:50] <sena_kun> oh, great

[21:51] <jdv> something must have gone awry on the merge or something

[21:51] <sena_kun> yup, can confirm

[21:51] * lizmat goes afk for a bit again&

[21:52] <sena_kun> I would cherry-pick those two commits into master, it'll look a bit odd, but no way back now.

[21:52] <sena_kun> jdv, please, get plenty of rest, I know how it goes.

[21:54] <jdv> yeah.  mudane detail...  i pushed and deleted from local without pulling to get the ake added stuff:(
