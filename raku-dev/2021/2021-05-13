[08:36] <japhb> Morning, lizmat!  :-)

[08:37] <lizmat> very early morning for you, japhb :-)

[08:38] <japhb> Well, more like late night.  :-)

[08:41] <japhb> Actually I guess that's a good reminder to call it a night and pick all this up tomorrow.  :-)

[08:41] <japhb> &

[08:42] <lizmat> sleep well!

[08:42] <nwc10> but, "late night" is "small hours of the morning", so, see, it's always morning. :-)

[08:48] <nine> As it should be
