[00:15] <ugexe> so doing a diff with `RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 raku -Ilib t/spec/S10-packages/basic.t 2> new.out` with and without the commit does show its precompiling more with my change

[00:15] <ugexe> that uses 5 `use lib ...`

[00:18] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/63267181f024d2dbe4009e6ddf91f2cb#file-with-my-change-L9

[00:20] <ugexe> in the rakudo code before my changes that line says 1 RMD: Settings CORE.c loaded

[18:34] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/ugexe-patch-3: Ensure all methods use the updated comp-unit-id

[18:34] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/ugexe-patch-3: 

[18:34] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/ugexe-patch-3: In a recent change the distribution id was added to the module name when generating a comp-unit-id for `need` to allow multiple versions of the same name to be loaded. However,`need` and `resolve` need to generate identical comp-unit-ids for a given module name since `resolve` will be called by CUR::PrecompilationRepository when `need`ing a module.

[18:59] <MasterDuke> ugexe: is ^^^ "just" a correctness fix, or does it also address the slowdown?

[19:00] <releasable6> Next release in â‰ˆ4 days and â‰ˆ23 hours. 1 blocker. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[19:04] <ugexe> both. i dunno how much faster the spectest is yet but it was faster for the one `use lib` heavy test i was using to benchmark. fwiw i would expect my changes to be slightly slower than before, but not more than slightly

[19:20] <MasterDuke> i just tested it and a spectest is now back around what it was before the curfs fix (i.e., after the new-disp merge) at ~175s

[19:27] <ugexe> cool, i'll merge it then

[19:28] <MasterDuke> (and the spectest also passed)
