[00:24] <tbrowder> hi, would love an eyeball or two on Rakudo PR #4434

[00:33] <ugexe> MasterDuke: every extra lib/repo added will add overhead. in your example the extra lib happens to be a CURFS (and not just a CURFS but one without a META6.json so it has to first find all files recursively) which means if it hasn't been precompiled yet as a CURFS it'll need to do that (generate .precomp)

[00:35] <ugexe> maybe better to do a comparison to add like `-I "inst#/Users/ugexe/.rakubrew/versions/moar-blead/install/share/perl6/core"` to the second example
