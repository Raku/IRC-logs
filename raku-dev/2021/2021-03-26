[09:35] <dogbert17> .seen lizmat

[09:35] <tellable6> dogbert17, I saw lizmat 2021-03-25T14:05:30Z in #moarvm: <lizmat> jnthn: so any idea how many people watched ?

[09:47] <dogbert17> m: wordcase("abc def ghi") for ^100_000

[09:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "wordcase(\"abc def ghi\")" in expression "wordcase(\"abc def ghi\")" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[09:48] <dogbert17> m: wordcase("abc def ghi") for ^100_000; say now - INIT now;

[09:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤0.02217478␤Useless use of "wordcase(\"abc def ghi\")" in expression "wordcase(\"abc def ghi\")" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[09:48] <dogbert17> m: "abc def ghi".wordcase for ^100_000; say now - INIT now;

[09:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «3.9773093␤»

[09:48] <dogbert17> lizmat: any theory as to the timing differences?

[09:49] * dogbert17 is probably doing something stupid

[10:08] *** sena_kun joined
[10:21] * lizmat looks

[10:23] <lizmat> looks like the first case is constant folded, the second isn't ?

[10:24] <lizmat> dogbert17 ^^

[10:26] <dogbert17> m: my $a = wordcase("abc def ghi") for ^100_000; say now - INIT now;

[10:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «0.03031934␤»

[10:26] <dogbert17> m: my $a = "abc def ghi".wordcase for ^100_000; say now - INIT now;

[10:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «3.9287443␤»

[10:26] <dogbert17> lizmat: so this is to be expected then?

[10:27] <lizmat> I'm not saying that: I'm merely stating the current fact :-)

[10:29] <lizmat> and wordcase is relatively expensive, so the difference is more pronounced

[10:30] <dogbert17> I'm looking a bit into differences beteween sub and method form of some routines. In many cases the sub form runs in twice the time compared to the method form

[10:31] * dogbert17 is trying to lure lizmat into doing some cool opts

[10:31] <lizmat> that might work: wordcase has been on my long list for a while

[10:32] *** domidumont joined
[10:32] <dogbert17> aha, I'd better keep investigating. Perhaps something else will turn up :)

[10:34] <dogbert17> a quick look at the profiler shows zero GC's vs 288 GC's

[10:34] <dogbert17> among other things

[10:35] <lizmat> yeah, the sub version is equivalent to: my $a = 42 for ^100_000

[10:36] <dogbert17> now that'll be fast :)

[10:36] <MasterDuke> interesting. because the sub just calls the method on the argument

[10:37] <dogbert17> that is indeed interesting

[10:42] <lizmat> "wordcase" is marked "is pure" 

[10:43] <lizmat> so open to optimization of a given input

[10:43] <lizmat> *static

[10:44] <lizmat> so I think the optimizer then just runs the wordcase("abc") at optimize time, and WVals the result

[10:46] <MasterDuke> huh. rakudo only has a single method marked 'is pure' (`src/core.c/Str.pm6:841:    method !hexify(str $char) is pure {`)

[10:47] <MasterDuke> but 156 subs

[10:47] <lizmat> I'm not sure it even makes sense on methods ?

[11:59] <sena_kun> Was there an RSC meeting last week?

[12:00] <lizmat> yes, there was

[12:00] <sena_kun> I see no "minutes" note posted, but glad it was.

[13:36] <nine> From IO::Handle docs: "Using getc to get a single keypress from a terminal will only work properly if you've set the terminal to "unbuffered"."

[13:36] <nine> Good hint! No how would one do that exactly?

[13:55] <leont> Didn't someone (gfldex?) file an issue recently along the lines of "when should support argumented blocks? Or was that just a suggestion on his blogpost.

[17:20] <japhb> nine: I think I answered this recently, let me go see if it was in a logged channel.

[17:22] <japhb> Yeah, here: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2021-03-17#l557

[17:46] * lizmat just pushed https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5d058ea8814c833bac26c7e710d4e9e023d82829   # dogbert17 

[17:50] <lizmat> "Make Str.wordcase about 5x as fast"

[17:52] *** domidumont left
[17:56] <japhb> Commit descriptions like that just warm my heart.  :-)

[22:46] <gfldex> leont: I mentioned it in my blog and jnthn picked up on it in https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/03/15/towards-a-new-general-dispatch-mechanism-in-moarvm/ .

[22:46] <gfldex> leont: Close to the bottom of his post.

[22:48] <leont> That explains why I couldn't find it, that's not where I was looking

[23:31] <leont> Though it's not entirely what I meant. Even without new dispatching I'd really like to be able to rename $_ to something clearer, based on the knowledge of the match
