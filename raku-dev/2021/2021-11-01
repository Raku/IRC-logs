[12:14] <[Coke]> Used to work on a MOO/MUD alternative to IRC and this was one of the reasons we had a hard time getting everyone to agree to update to Unicode back in the day. (the server is still up, I don't use it any more, but I'm pretty sure they're still using ASCII).

[12:17] <[Coke]> is 'rakubrew build-zef' getting zef latest from git? If so, should it be latest release?

[12:17] <[Coke]> (just guessing based on the git output when I run that command)

[13:40] <lizmat> que?

[13:40] <lizmat> :-)

[13:41] <timo> lizmat: you could make the "our" also code-font in the tweet about our hash is map is export

[16:08] <sena_kun> lizmat, yeah, too bad I was stupid enough not to fix it earlier. But now we have something for the next week. :)

[16:09] <lizmat> indeed... it's always good to have something good waiting in the wings

[16:14] <[Coke]> .seen [Coke]

[17:38] <Kaiepi> will 2 Str:D given identical graphemes always be =:=?

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 580b3ba79: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:47] <Kaiepi> it's ok for roles to distinguish Str:D in the case i'm thinking of, since they'd need the extra check anyway

[17:47] <Kaiepi> if it's not possible with Str:D alone, then there should be a means of encoding named type parameters such that they're cacheable
