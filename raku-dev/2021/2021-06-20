[08:44] <Xliff> I need CompUnit::Repository::Install to emit more output. Preferably content I can specify. What would be the best way to go about doing that.

[08:45] <Xliff> And no... NONE of the existing Rakudo facilities are sufficient or this purpose. It needs to be something I can use to output data most other installers output.

[09:54] <lizmat> what output do you need?

[09:56] <lizmat> I mean, it's just running tools/build/install-core-dist.raku ?

[09:56] <lizmat> perhaps you could make a PR for that?

[10:19] <sena_kun> lizmat, see PRs

[16:36] <razetime> hello

[16:37] <razetime> do the raku ircs still exist on freenode?

[16:39] <tyil> razetime: not as official raku channels, at least

[16:40] <tyil> it could be that other people have registered #raku on Freenode

[16:40] <razetime> the rakudo CONTRIBUTING.md document still points at freenode as the main IRC channel for dev

[16:40] <razetime> Should I open an issue for it?

[16:40] <tyil> ah, that's something we can fix I'm sure
