[07:27] <moon-child> it's a real shame niecza doesn't bootstrap on newer versions of mono

[07:28] <moon-child> I kind of want to fix it, but...bisecting through 10s of thousands of commits of an enormous software project is not my idea of a fun afternoon

[19:37] <MasterDuke> .seen lizmat

[19:37] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I saw lizmat 2021-07-16T10:50:27Z in #raku: <lizmat> :-)

[19:38] <MasterDuke> hopefully her house is not underwater

[19:44] <timo> looking at gmaps the spot they live at sits pretty much between two "limburg province floods" markers, but i have no idea how exactly these work

[19:46] <timo> i'm not sure where to find details about this, but i could imagine they were asked to leave their house

[19:50] <timo> last updates on their city homepage says the water is receding

[19:50] <MasterDuke> i think El_Che and leont are from the netherlands also, maybe they have some info

[20:14] <gfldex> is there a way to replace a multi sub candidate in 6.e that is defined in 6.c as NYI?

[20:18] <nine> lizmat reports all feet dry

[20:38] <timo> hooray

[20:39] <timo> there are so many wonderful things in their basement as well as ground floor

[20:39] <timo> all those books

[20:56] <vrurg> gfldex: I think re-declaring the candidate should work.

[20:58] <gfldex> Sadly, it doesnt. The multi candidate is added to the chain in that case but never executed, because the first full MMD-match wins.

[21:04] <vrurg> Heh... what sub is it?

[21:04] <gfldex> We would need a FALLBACK for multi sub to solve this, I suppose.

[21:06] <gfldex> multi sub postcircumfix:<[ ]>( \SELF, HyperWhatever:D, *%other )

[21:06] <gfldex> @array[**] is NYI in 6.c. I aim to change that.

[21:08] <vrurg> Basically, the right solution would be to produce a new proto for 6.e and install all unmodified candidates under it to avoid memory bloat. Then the new candidate can be just declared.

[21:09] <vrurg> But why not to implement it for 6.c?

[21:09] <gfldex> I was thinking the same. But foe postcircumfix:<[ ]> this is not really practical. Way to many candidates for the in 6.c .

[21:09] <gfldex> I might end up moving it to 6.c .

[21:10] <gfldex> Any only have the 2 candidates that don't work in 6.c in 6.e.

[21:11] <vrurg> That'd be the best, if I get the situation correctly. NYI means it is expected to work in 6.c. So, why not eventually implement it?

[21:13] <gfldex> That's for tomorrow.

[21:13] <vrurg> With regard to moving the candidates, it could be done by one loop. A bit of a hack, but not the worst kind of it.

[21:15] <vrurg> But otherwise it is certainly a problem to find a good solution for. Perhaps a kind of priority trait to be specified for a candidate.
