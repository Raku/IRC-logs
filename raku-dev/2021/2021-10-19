[06:28] <japhb> Does anyone have preferences for tab completion behavior?  I'm working on https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor (to be a pure Raku alternative to Readline and Linenoise, perhaps useable in the Rakudo REPL), and I'm thinking about how to approach tab completion.

[06:28] <japhb> The behavior of Linenoise and the bash prompt for tab completion are very different: Linenoise rotates through available possible completions every time you hit <tab>, but only ever shows you that one.

[06:29] <japhb> Bash instead tries to advance as far as it can with a common prefix, but if there's no common prefix and you <tab> again, it lists all the available completions

[06:30] <japhb> (and redisplays the prompt and the input-in-progress)

[06:31] <japhb> Neither one gives you any information about the options other than the pure text, and I have a feeling more advanced editors do more than this (in fact I think Comma's been demonstrated to have a quite advanced version)

[06:32] <japhb> Anyone with feelings on this, please leave them here (or in an issue on the repo) so I can review and cogitate

[06:35] *** Xliff_ joined
[06:36] <nine> I like Bash's behaviour. Or maybe I'm just more used to it.

[07:06] <Mondenkind> japhb: I like zsh's behaviour

[07:07] <Mondenkind> it shows you a list of completions on the _following_ line when you press tab; and then pressing tab repeatedly cycles through them, while continuing to show them

[07:08] <Mondenkind> my gut is that if I wanted something much fancier than that I would no longer want a line editor.  But I am not sure what you mean by 'information about the options'.  Like annotating return values of methods?  Or using colour for [something]?

[07:14] <Mondenkind> (err, return _types_)

[07:26] <MasterDuke> i think the windows terminal and vim both do it the linenoise way, but i do prefer the bash behavior

[07:27] * Mondenkind finds bash kind of useless.  Why scroll the screen?  Why do I want to see the results of my previous completions?

[07:27] *** Xliff_ joined
[07:30] <Mondenkind> here's a solution: make the tab completion approach configurable!

[22:07] <sena_kun> tbrowder, ^

[22:09] <tbrowder> so what can i do to fix the wording on the heredoc entry?

[22:10] <sena_kun> tbrowder, were your patches merged?

[22:12] <tbrowder> yes

[22:13] <tbrowder> i just changed the PR title to read a bit better (PR #4567)

[22:15] <sena_kun> tbrowder, for the best results you can log them yourself. The draft is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft and you click "Edit Page" and write a description. Your fix goes under `Fixes` category, I think, and then you add an entry like `+ $text `. I'll format commit hashes myself, just leave a link to PR there.

[22:16] <tbrowder> i see yr new draft, but what happened to the other draft?

[22:16] <sena_kun> what's "the other draft"?

[22:17] <tbrowder> in the query by Kaiepi above

[22:18] <sena_kun> that's the only one

[22:18] <tbrowder> the response has a link to a draft page

[22:19] <sena_kun> the releasable6 bot checks this wiki page. it still contained the old changelog, so it said "has not started yet", I updated it and it says another thing now.

[22:19] <sena_kun> If you mean https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/da5c80edea53592cded7c9f4b386d627 then it's not a changelog, but rather something to write a changelog from.

[22:20] <tbrowder> ok, iâ€™ll fix itâ€¦

[22:21] <sena_kun> thanks!
