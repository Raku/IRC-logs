[15:03] <tbrowder> .ask lizmat i'm happy with DateTime's full round-trip capability for DateTime to/from Julian date (for full range of gregorian dates). next logical step is to provide gregorian calendar date to/from julian calendar date. question: add capability to DateTime or put in a DateTime::Julian module?

[15:03] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to lizmat
