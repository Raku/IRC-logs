[00:31] <japhb> Got this building Rakudo HEAD just now:

[00:31] <japhb> t/04-nativecall/02-simple-args.t ................................ Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)

[00:31] <japhb> No subtests run 

[00:31] <japhb> nine: ^^

[00:38] <japhb> Rebuilt again and it passed this time.  Flaky test?

[00:50] *** kjp left
[01:04] <raydiak> apparently that's a bit of a problem child. just at a quick glance there are issues open for failures in that file on ARM, M1 macs, WSL, and clang builds of rakudo on linux

[01:21] <japhb> Ooof

[06:57] <patrickb> o/

[06:59] <patrickb> re yesterdays discussion wrt what to do with the Star Bundle. I'm pretty sure the module list wasn't properly maintained. So yes giving the list some love is in order.

[07:02] <patrickb> In my experience the module search has been sufficient to rather quickly find all possible modules to solve a given problem.

[07:03] *** vrurg_ joined
[07:04] <patrickb> To more quickly judge which module to choose it's all a question of which metrics we provide the user. Tests passing is definitely a good thing to have. IIRC we even once had something similar to smoke (automatic test reporting of users test runs) in zef, but it was turned off soon and I thing the corresponding webservice doesn't exist anymore.

[07:05] *** vrurg left
[07:07] <patrickb> Metrics I think would help me to decide which module to use: When was the module initially released? When was the last release? How many releases have there been in total? Upstream and downstream count.

[07:08] <patrickb> But that's more of a topic for raku.land.

[08:00] <moon-child> \o

[08:17] <JRaspass> Totally agree on the above metrics, I'm tempted to steal the new bus factor from metacpan too

[08:51] <patrickb> JRaspass: Thanks for your work on raku.land!

[08:53] <lizmat> so what is our feeling about this:

[08:53] <lizmat> m: for ^10 { LAST last }

[08:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1bd0411c0: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!===‚ê§last without loop construct‚ê§¬ª

[08:53] <lizmat> aka, using control exception constructs inside phasers

[08:54] <lizmat> m: for ^10 { NEXT last }   # there's actually a spectest for this one

[08:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1bd0411c0: ( no output )

[08:54] <patrickb> JRaspass: If I may wish for one more thing: Displaying the ecosystem of a module in the module page and the search list. Workaround is looking in the address bar, so not high prio,but I think it's a good thing to give the ecos some visibility.

[09:00] <JRaspass> Oh that's a great idea, I shall add it to the issues

[09:00] <JRaspass> done, https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/6

[09:01] <patrickb> Yay!

[09:22] <tbrowder> hi, looking at raku.land i see dups on prolific author list

[09:24] <tbrowder> JRaspass: ++ for raku.land, esp for the alpha sorted list!

[09:26] <tbrowder> if you're looking for suggestion: add sort by date of publishing

[09:28] <tbrowder> correction, the dups are on the popular dist list

[12:57] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to JRaspass

[13:01] <tbrowder> .ask lizmat is there an issue with my rakudo docs PR #4441? my intent was to get published pretty much as is and let you experts add to it--a living WIP

[13:01] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[14:51] <melezhik> releasable: status

[14:51] <releasable6> melezhik, Next release in ‚âà15 days and ‚âà4 hours. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[14:51] <releasable6> melezhik, Details: https://gist.github.com/b4816c38719559d3b14857165907813a

[15:04] <gfldex> lizmat: `LAST last` That one is tricky. Because it's a NOP, and such could be implemented as a NOP, but is also most likely a mistake. In a dynamically optimised language any NOP should vanish. I would impelent it as a NOP and warn.

[15:06] <gfldex> lizmat: The tricky one is `NEXT next` because that can have side effects and therefore must be executed. But again, it can also be a mistake.
