[14:28] <gfldex> The discord bridge bot complained about lack of RAM. The process has eaten 1.8GB while doing mostly nothing within 3 weeks or so.

[16:32] <timo> i wonder if we could ask the discord bot to take a heap snapshot on command and make it available as a file transfer or so
[17:00] <gfldex> How do I trigger a heap snapshot?
[17:06] <timo> the Telemetry module from rakudo has a sub called "snap" that you can pass :heap to
[17:07] <timo> pass True to get an autogenerated filename, a Str to get that as the filename (and path), or an IO::Path object
[17:09] <gfldex> It would be helpful if `snap(:heap)` would return the filename.

[17:43] <gfldex> The discord bot has been instructed to take one heap snapshot per day.

[18:07] <timo> oh, cool
[18:08] <timo> i can't guarantee we'll figure anything out, but with the heap snapshot it'll be much much less of a shot in the dark
