[16:04] <tbrowder> Xliff: \o/

[16:04] <Xliff> tbrowder: Hi.

[16:05] <tbrowder> i've been seeing a lot of activity from you lately

[16:06] <tbrowder> what ya wrking on?

[16:06] <Xliff> Yah. That's me. 

[16:06] <Xliff> And the answer to that question is generally: "my obsessions"

[16:06] <Xliff> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3S9hqD9PkT_kkbBI3D9hrcYUhE9jj9TfPRMpQcUpmE/edit?usp=sharing

[16:07] <tbrowder> ah, is that like my raku "rabbit hole" obsession i wonder

[16:07] <Xliff> ^^ Old version from last month. It's ... grown

[16:07] <Xliff> tbrowder: Oh, most likely. :)

[16:07] <Xliff> Crossed the 470,000 lines of raku mark

[16:08] <tbrowder> wow, that's organized! i vaguely rmbr seeing that before.

[16:09] <Xliff> :)

[16:10] <tbrowder> in fact, i vaguely rmbr creating a raku prog early on to do something similar.  let me go down in my debian basement ^^^^^.

[16:11] <Xliff> :D

[16:11] <tbrowder> does yr prog have sophisticated heuristics to count linex

[16:12] <tbrowder> *lines of code?

[16:15] <Xliff> I have written one to do so, yes. That is not the one I am using in the sheet.

[16:15] <tbrowder> suggesstion for us rakoons, add a link in yr sheet for repos of public modules

[16:17] <Xliff> Ah. It used to have them. 

[16:17] <tbrowder> i'm putting yr spreadsheet idea on my TODO list. did you see the ne spreadsheet module jnthn published recently?

[16:17] <Xliff> Yep.

[16:18] <Xliff> My largest issue is that I really work in ODS

[16:18] <tbrowder> he beat me to it. i love programmatically creating spreadsheets.

[16:18] <Xliff> But I want a way to keep both sheets sync'd. But they are so different that it's kinda hard.

[16:18] <Xliff> So the Google sheet lags behind my local version, which I update weekly.

[16:19] <tbrowder> have you looked at using some perl modules to wrap?

[16:19] <Xliff> Not really. 

[16:19] <Xliff> Been so busy with $dayJob and my current project (GUPnP) that I haven't had much time

[16:19] <Xliff> https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GUPnP

[16:20] <Xliff> I have the basics done, I am in testing, now and there are certain things that are... vexing me.

[16:20] <Xliff> GLib has some of the most frustrating interfaces I have seen. LOL

[16:21] <tbrowder> that's how my spreadsheet module is set up. if you don't require a lot of fancy formatting, there are some ods readers so you could read your master and write the corresponding xlsx

[16:21] <Xliff> Nah. I need rw ods

[16:21] <tbrowder> ok, there are some of those too

[16:22] <Xliff> I convert to xlsx when necessary.

[16:22] <tbrowder> gotcha

[16:22] <Xliff> I was thinking about writing one, but then I got sidetracked... heh

[16:22] <tbrowder> does $job use ods or xlsx

[16:23] <Xliff> $job is mostly a Microsoft shop masking an AWS infrastructure.

[16:23] <Xliff> So xlsx

[16:23] <Xliff> O

[16:23] <Xliff> I'm sneaking in some Raku. :)

[16:23] <tbrowder> my daughter works for noaa and they use google stuff now

[16:23] <Xliff> Nice!

[16:24] <Xliff> I have hax'd Google Maps in my time.

[16:24] <tbrowder> i say yuk cause i have so many years invested in csv and xlsx

[16:25] <Xliff> Hahaha!

[16:25] <Xliff> I may write a client for Google Sheets in Raku one day.

[16:25] <tbrowder> oh, i have a raku gmail reader thnx to raku oauth2

[16:25] <Xliff> Assuming someone doesn't beat me to it.

[16:25] <Xliff> Yeah, I noticed someone had a Raku OAuth2 module.

[16:26] <Xliff> Was going to use that.

[16:26] <tbrowder> it's hacky but not enough time to tidy it.

[16:26] <Xliff> Considering I've written OAuth2 for Eve-Online

[16:26] <tbrowder> sounds like a dating app ;-D

[16:26] <Xliff> Also written auth for Amazon AWS

[16:27] <Xliff> LOL. No. It's an MMORPG. https://www.eveonline.com/

[16:28] <tbrowder> oh, aren't  [Coke] and tony-o and moritz involved too

[16:29] <tbrowder> my grandson and son-in-law would like that i'll bet

[16:29] <Xliff> I don't really know.

[20:51] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[20:59] <nine> Xliff: yes it does

[20:59] <nine> Or rather the dynamic linker does

[22:13] <ugexe> I just released zef v0.10.0, which adds pod6 (loosely modeled after the raku docs) to a large portion of the code base. There isn't anything particularly interesting about this other than occasionally someone asks for examples from raku modules, and this would be one of the larger and ubiquitous ones

[22:13] <tellable6> 2021-01-03T15:09:27Z #raku <tbrowder> ugexe the apparent "problem" with zef was my failure to see the msg that one of several deps had failed testing and thus the attempted installation failed. zef is working fine!
