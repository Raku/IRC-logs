[11:04] <sena_kun> lizmat, I guess ^ is needed for the point?

[11:04] <lizmat> yes, and there's another one coming up for binding array slices

[11:10] <lizmat> sena_kun: now going to make sure we have tests for these

[11:10] <lizmat> maybe wait until I have done those?  Just in case...

[11:12] <sena_kun> lizmat, well, given the fix was not the final one, I will do a blin run nontheless. Also, it seems Blin server behaves better (at least this time, fingers crossed). I'll also try another improvement, so the release is tomorrow then, I guess.

[11:13] <lizmat> yeah, doing a Blin run seems safe  :-)

[11:20] <sena_kun> I hope people won't merge things into master too eagerly.

[11:22] * lizmat won't

[11:22] <lizmat> BTW, I've also removed the inlining tests, so the number of flappers should be reduced now

[11:24] <sena_kun> great

[11:25] <sena_kun> I won't cherry-pick, so they will be included.

[11:36] <lizmat> m: my @a = 1..5; dd @a[1,^Inf] = "a"...*

[11:39] <moritz> ns1:~ # su - camelia

[11:39] <moritz> su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/camelia: No such file or directory

[11:40] <moritz> I'm surprised it does anything at all :-/

[11:41] <moritz> and the systemctl services seem to be gone as well

[11:41] <moritz> seems like someone or something has made tabula rasa :-(

[11:41] <moritz> nine: do you happen to know anything about that?

[11:42] <moritz> deleting the home dir might have been done from a malicious script through evalbot, but removing the systemctl services requires root

[11:53] <nine> moritz: oh, I'm in the process of moving to new hardware

[11:53] <nine> the VM lives at camelia.detonation.org

[11:54] <nine> Problem is that it currently has only IPv6, but as I discovered on Sunday, Github doesn't support IPv6 yet, because....the 90s never die I guess?

[12:00] <MasterDuke> rba: is there any way to configure the azure pipelines to not fail because they can't publish the artifacts more than once? e.g., i reran the pipelines for my moarvm PR (https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1438) because the failing rakudo tests were recently removed, but some of the pipelines still fail
