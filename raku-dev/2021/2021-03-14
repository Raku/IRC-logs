[00:23] <tbrowder> ref either new doc site, a question: as we change the master branch of the docs, are either or both sites publicly upated from source without human intervention? if not, imho, not much is gained over the current state of affairs.

[01:11] <[Coke]> they're both POC right now, no?

[01:11] <[Coke]> Getting them published from master on the regular would have to be done before moving them to the current hostname.

[01:39] <cj> hey Coke!

[02:19] <codesections> tbrowder: I'm not sure I follow.  I agree that Contentious Deployment would be a _nice_ feature to add, but why do you say that all the other features are "not much" of a gain without CD?

[02:20] *** kvw_5_ joined
[02:20] <codesections> For example, after looking at sena_kun's version, it adds the ability to execute any example Raku code inline in the docs.  That seems _huge_, whether or not it comes with CD

[02:26] <tbrowder> i haven't investigated them very much, but my first impression is they are more cosmetically different. i need to know more about the real flow from doc master to publishing. are maintenance features visible to interested viewers, all tooling visible, etc. i personally like the current appearance of our doc site, but agree that things like search and such could use some love.

[02:27] <tbrowder> yes, those features are nice, but at what cost?

[02:28] <tbrowder> not trying to nay say, just grumbling...

[02:28] <codesections> I haven't looked into them as much as I plan to, and I have some concerns as well (esp. re: the "at what cost" point you mentioned).  But, even from a quick look, it's clear that the differences are more than cosmetic 

[03:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈6 days and ≈15 hours. 3 blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[08:19] <sena_kun> tbrowder, why change the master? I do use my branch and maintain it because it's hard to convince people to actually merge my changes when the website is still in beta. About auto update without human intervention - yes, it surely should and can be done easily, no biggie. The current state of humans doing updates is far from being acceptable.

[10:21] <sena_kun> codesections, by the way, not sure if you know, but try to click at an example in the docs. :)

[10:25] <codesections> sena_kun: yeah, I saw that.  Very cool, and something that will be **very** helpful for new users learning Raku!

[10:28] <sena_kun> Alright, glad to know. I wonder if rba is busy today.

[10:33] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: very cool. something's not right though, the output isn't correct. e.g., the first code block in http://178.128.54.210:10000/type/BagHash

[10:34] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, that's a bug report, yes. I would like to have more of these once we have a FAST infra that can be updated.
