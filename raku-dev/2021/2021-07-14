[11:42] <raydiak> been afk all day. a few meandering thoughts about the meta discussion: (1) yes actually I am fairly familiar with how meta is used in rakudo, the logic rakudo follows to locate and load modules, and also how meta is used in module managers both past and present. I did not link that search because it represents the entirety of my awareness. I will attempt to communicate my intentions more clearly in the

[11:42] <raydiak> future

[11:42] <raydiak> (2) my first thought about the "depends" issue is that the thing I'm proposing should complain about weird-looking contents of anything it is aware of which includes depends and the rest of the currently documented spec, however see further thoughts under #7. it should ensure that the content is valid, and catch things like missing the "requires" level of the hash-of-hash-of-arrays form of depends, as one

[11:42] <raydiak> example. it should not complain if depends is missing, as it is optional

[11:42] <raydiak> (3) zef doing magical dependency sniffing is a perfect example, as it would lead to people writing meta files which only work with a single tool which implements unspecced behavior, which is precisely the kind of fragmentation we don't want. if we want to allow for that type of behavior, it should either become part of the next version of the spec, or there should be an extension system to declare that

[11:42] <raydiak> nonstandard behavior so that at least other tools which don't recognize that extension can say "I don't support this meta file" instead of happily installing modules in a silently broken way without their dependencies. or reporting them incorrectly in a dependency graph or web page, or whatever the particular tool does

[11:42] <raydiak> (4) as for removing cool possibilities, I again defer to versioning and extensions. any spec, by definition, removes possibilities. that doesn't mean that formalizing things is bad, particularly where interoperability and long-term stability is concerned. I would think something like a "meta-ext" key with an array of extensions e.g. "autodeps" (referring to #3) would provide for the possibilities, and

[11:42] <raydiak> extentions which become popular may even become part of the next version of the spec, or perhaps part of a set of "standardized extensions" (think "-zef-autodeps" becoming just "autodeps" or so). in this way we could also allow for advanced functionality which is specced, but may not be practical or easy for all tools to implement. it would make the meta files themselves somewhat "modular"

[11:42] <raydiak> (5) ignoring unknown keys with extra ancillary data I don't see a problem with, as long as they can be safely ignored and the module can still be properly installed/introspected/whatever. an example would be a field for an image and/or icon, or something like that. something which is required functionality for handling the module should be declared as an extension

[11:42] <raydiak> (6) if doing it in core is really so abhorrent, I still disagree (we build in the whole unicode database, html entities, pod to text, unit testing...but we draw the line at meta files? sounds wrong to me)...but fine, if that's the case, then we need something like roast for meta files. a central implementation-agnostic standard, controlled by the raku community, which all implementations of meta producers

[11:42] <raydiak> and consumers should aim to comply with, regardless of extra keys or extensions

[11:42] <raydiak> (7) I can see the argument for not outright failing if parts that a particular implementation doesn't use aren't valid. I can also see the argument that anything which is a standard key should always have valid contents, regardless of whether that key is specifically used. what about suppressable and non-fatal warnings when loading a meta with invalid parts, which only become fatal if you attempt to access

[11:42] <raydiak> those particular keys through the standard API? if we don't attempt to validate nonstandard keys, and have an extension system, and versioning of the meta spec, and allow the warnings to be suppressed, I think that allows for plenty of growth while still having a formal spec

[11:43] <raydiak> (8) unfortunately I will continue to be pressed for time until at least the day after tomorrow. even right after I send these messages, I need to get one more thing done before I go to bed and wake up for an appointment tomorrow, and it's already after 4 AM here. but I will continue to backlog and respond when I'm able if we want to continue to consider this

[16:00] <tonyo> counter point for #3 - low level magic i agree with, if zef can do it then other tools can do it and dictating how module authors write modules makes for a bad experience in writing modules.  rakudo, again, doesn't do anything with depends and shouldn't enforce anything. #4, no one said formalizing is bad - removing flexibility from tools is bad, changing the argument and then defending against that point 

[16:00] <tonyo> doesn't make the original point invalid.  #6 this already exists in fez, if it's on fez then zef can install it.  #7 this is my entire point but we don't need an extension system, if rakudo doesn't use it then it shouldn't arbitrarily attempt to validate it (like "depends") because it isn't the authority on whether that information is what the consumer needs.  (also, this point is the scope of my 

[16:01] <tonyo> argument).  #8 nbd, i'm fine with this mode of communication

[16:01] <tonyo> also, for #6 this is the biggest win imo, p6c and cpan both have no validation or guarantees

[16:03] <tonyo> fez can likely install it*

[16:03] <tonyo> argh, zef can likely install it*

[16:35] <jdv> it sounds like you are advocating for a single solution, i'm not a fan.

[16:35] <jdv> but i'm just a casual observer

[16:36] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/new-disp: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/76d05b1358

[16:38] <tonyo> jdv: what do you mean by single solution?

[16:38] <jdv> i like the fact that p6c and cpan "ecosystems" exist for the same reason i like that jvm and js raku impls exist - more than one impl/option tends to help lift quality and rout out "badness"

[16:39] <tonyo> ah, i'm not advocating for single solution, i'm advocating for tighter controls on the ecosystem side.  less about having one and more about having tools built for the job.  p6c and cpan both allow you to upload something with bad METAs

[16:40] <jdv> sounds like a feature of a loosely coupled distributed system to me:)

[16:40] <tonyo> i'm advocating fez because it doesn't allow you to upload a "version":"*" to the ecosystem and will make some guarantee that if you download "auth:tony-o" you're getting one of my modules.  i can upload to cpan under my pause but in my meta put "auth":"cpan:jdv" and your name is on there

[16:41] <tonyo> if that's a feature then rakudo shouldn't be validating anything and it should be up the loosely coupled distribution system to figure out how to make it available to rakudo

[16:44] <tonyo> my point isn't single server, it's that rakudo shouldn't validate what it doesn't absolutely need.  as far as cleaning up the quality of the ecosystem there's more value in building tools designed for the job and not serving distributions that require further processing to even be searched for

[16:45] <jdv> i thought that type of decision making was more for the "recommendation manager" and not the storage backend

[16:45] <tonyo> p6c and cpan both don't index raku dists, zef has to run a cron to re-index them in a way that makes sense to be installed

[16:46] <jdv> if you take your way to its conclusion you rule out the possibility of using backends like github/gitlab/a local "registry" like minicpan...

[16:46] <jdv> i'm not arguing specifically for p6c or cpan - just against zef because its single instance only afaik

[16:46] <tonyo> you can use those as a backend but you need some guarantees

[16:46] <jdv> s/zef/fez/

[16:47] <jdv> can i setup a fez on my laptop?

[16:47] <tonyo> pure git anything makes no guarantee that i don't upload some hate speech named modules with your auth name on them

[16:47] <tonyo> jdv: for sure

[16:49] <jdv> so?

[16:51] <tonyo> that degrades the quality of the ecosystem.

[16:52] <jdv> who said the ecosystem has to have the smarts?

[16:52] <tonyo> the goal is improve the quality of the ecosystem.

[16:52] <tonyo> one avenue is to make rakudo validate the meta

[16:53] <tonyo> another avenue is to make the ecosystem itself make some guarantee of quality

[16:53] <tonyo> uploading modules that get indexed under another user's name is a degradation of quality

[16:54] <tonyo> uploading modules that supercede all other versions with that name is another degredation of that quality

[16:54] <jdv> i just don't think ruling out certain types of backends is a maximally valuable way to go

[16:54] <tonyo> i don't disagree with you..if you reread what i wrote then you'll see i'm not saying that.  the quality in those ecosystems could be vastly improved

[16:56] <tonyo> git is perfectly fine but it needs a better way to be indexed.  running crons and making no guarantees of auth to the actual user, that version isn't set in a way that it gets picked by the recommendation manager every time, etc make for poor quality.

[16:57] <tonyo> cpan has the same troubles

[16:57] <jdv> are there docs on how to setup a "local fez"?

[17:01] <jdv> sorry to start something and run but i have to run:(  i think we're not on such a different page as i thought.

[17:01] <tonyo> there arent, you can install fez with zef if that's easier for you.  i can also add some docs on how to run it for development purposes

[17:02] <tonyo> jdv: i think we're of similar thinking - i don't like corners.  i just also think that p6c and cpan could be greatly improved for use with rakudo if quality is the goal
