[13:03] <sjn> Hey, I found an unfortunate typo in the release announcement: https://rakudo.org/post/announce-rakudo-release-2021.07 – The scheduled date for the next release (#149) is tomorrow! :-)
[13:04] <lizmat> Altai-man patrickb ^^
[13:04] <Altai-man> sjn, thanks for reading it! alas this typo happens in every other release...
[13:04] <patrickb> sjn: That's a known typo we decided to not do a minor release for...
[13:04] <patrickb> But thanks for spotting :-)
[13:04] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset
[13:04] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2021-07-26T13:04:40Z”
[13:05] <patrickb> Ah, but on rakudo.org it could be corrected...
[13:05] <sjn> yeah
[13:06] <patrickb> Actually nice to know someone actually reads those announcements given we started putting them on rakudo.org only last month!
[13:08] <sjn> No worries; Keep on keeping on! :-)
