[11:34] <masak> moritz: I wouldn't know -- except to note that stability is hard (if not impossible) in anything distributed

[11:49] <moritz> masak: don't mind me, I'm just frustrated with it 'cause the kids' home schooling is done through it, and the experience is way worse than zoom, for example

[13:03] <moritz> FYI the Raku CI/CD bot grant has been approved by TPF, and I'm the grant manager

[13:07] <nine> \o/

[13:13] <leont> I wanted to write just a feature request, but I ended up writing a feature instead :-p

[13:28] <moritz> leont: accidental implementation?

[14:11] <masak> moritz: my sympathies

[14:11] <masak> moritz: although I'm not sure "home schooling" is the right term... that usually means the parents are doing the teaching, not the school

[14:12] <masak> maybe the term is being repurposed in these times to mean that, though

[14:12] <MasterDuke> schooling at home vs home schooling maybe?

[14:20] <masak> maybe

[14:22] <masak> I'm currently based in the south of Mainland China. our schools were closed for a while about a year ago, back in March and April. we got a taste of the remote/video conferencing stuff back then.

[14:58] <leont> moritz: accidental isn't quite the right word, it's most like writing the examples was as much work as writing the actual code, so I just might as well do the latter
