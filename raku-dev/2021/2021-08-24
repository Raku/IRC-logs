[08:42] <patrickb> .

[08:42] <patrickb> ping Altai-man

[08:42] <Altai-man> patrickb, yup

[08:43] <patrickb> Congrats to the release. :-)

[08:43] <Altai-man> patrickb, I know the packages want to be uploaded along with rakudo release announcement, don't have time exactly, planned to do it this evening. if you beat me that's nice

[08:44] <patrickb> Currently on vacation. Thus didn't notice the release earlier.

[08:45] <Altai-man> patrickb, enjoy your well deserved rest time!

[08:45] <patrickb> I will probably be able to be there this evening. I'd propose that you give it a try to do the paackages and I'll be available as backup.

[08:45] <patrickb> ... and / or giving support.

[08:46] <Altai-man> patrickb, I already ran the pipeline, just need to do the uploading and I have commands in history, so probably don't bother.

[08:47] <patrickb> Ah ok. Sounds good.

[08:47] <patrickb> Then I probably won't be online. If there is a question, write me an email. I do check those regularly.

[08:50] <Altai-man> patrickb, alright, thanks for your time.

[08:51] <patrickb> Gladly. :-)
