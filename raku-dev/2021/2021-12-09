[15:50] <ab5tract> [Tux] do you still maintain a graph of those values over time? I'm curious as to where we are at these days
[15:51] <ab5tract> (relative to the past)
[15:51] <MasterDuke> ab5tract: https://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/speed4.html
[15:53] <ab5tract> MasterDuke: Thanks! What happened in November when the graph dips down to almost zero?
[15:53] <MasterDuke> the bottom of that graph isn't 0, it's something like 1.5
[15:55] <MasterDuke> there were some improvements right around then, but [Tux] upgraded their OS the next day or so, which might explain the jump back up

[19:38] <[Coke]> with c7e456d356, is Monterey working now?
[19:39] <[Coke]> (or is it just that specific bug fixed)
[19:46] <lizmat> it's my understanding that it was already fixed before that with f029ac83309f3
[19:46] <lizmat> c7e456d356 is a refinement
[20:28] <[Coke]> lizmat++
[20:29] <[Coke]> what a weird bug.
[20:29] <lizmat> yeah... it is probably really a libuv issue... and this is just a workaround

[21:14] <ugexe> its probably an apple issue
[21:15] <japhb> Sadly, that phrasing is not particularly actionable.  :-P
[21:15] <ugexe> yeah i've been trying to think of how to phrase an actual bug report  but i keep coming up short
[21:16] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/8c34b26c5edbcaed3784d3cf377ae334 thread #4 shows the before and after... the difference starting at the call to dlopen

[21:16] <ugexe> afterwards it seemingly is doing an mdns query

[21:22] <tonyo> which version is monterey?
[21:23] <japhb> tonyo: It's in the gist filenames
[21:23] <tonyo> iirc they switched from mdns around 10.10
[21:23] <tonyo> japhb: oh monterey is version monterey?
[21:24] <japhb> Yeah, new-monterey.out and old-bigsur.out
[21:25] <tonyo> monterey isn't a version number
[21:26] <japhb> OH!  You're asking what the OS version claims to be.  I thought you were asking, which of ugexe's two gisted files is which.
[21:27] <japhb> 12.x, says Wikipedia
[21:27] <tonyo> weird, they flip flopped the mdns lib a few times in v10 but monterey should've been fleshed out for bugs, v12
[21:27] <tonyo> ah gotcha
