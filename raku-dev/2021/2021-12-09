[10:37] <patrickb> jdv: All the binary release stuff will be taken care of. :-)

[10:40] <patrickb> jdv: There are quite some people involved. El_Che builds the rakudo_pkg packages, niner builds for OpenSUSE, I do the binary files on rakudo.org. There might be others that tightly follow the release that I'm unaware of.

[15:50] <ab5tract> [Tux] do you still maintain a graph of those values over time? I'm curious as to where we are at these days

[15:51] <ab5tract> (relative to the past)

[15:51] <MasterDuke> ab5tract: https://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/speed4.html

[15:53] <ab5tract> MasterDuke: Thanks! What happened in November when the graph dips down to almost zero?

[15:53] <MasterDuke> the bottom of that graph isn't 0, it's something like 1.5

[15:55] <MasterDuke> there were some improvements right around then, but [Tux] upgraded their OS the next day or so, which might explain the jump back up

[17:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[17:26] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: The internal method Kernel.cpu-cores-but-one uses a cached value for `nqp::cpucores`.  This also makes sure all calls in the core are now using this method, to prevent issues on MacOS Monterey.
