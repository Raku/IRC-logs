[09:39] <patrickb> Good *, everyone.

[09:39] <patrickb> May I ask for another set of eyes on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1385 ? Even though not currently marked as such it's basically a blocker for the next release, as https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4009 depends on it.

[09:41] <patrickb> lizmat, nwc10: This might be a bug you have the right skill set to tackle. I can offer testing stuff on Windows.

[09:46] <nwc10> Work is very busy for the next couple of weeks. I'm afraid I won't have time.

[09:47] <nwc10> My existing are still likely the strategy to try. I think it really needs someone interactively attempting them on MinGW

[09:48] <lizmat> patrickb: I ditched my last Windows laptop in 2003

[09:49] <patrickb> nwc10: *existing comments ?

[09:50] <nwc10> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1385 Dec 20th

[10:01] <patrickb> So if I understand correctly the first try will be to just replace the `pow_n` with a multiplication loop in stringify-to-precision2() in src/HLL/sprintf.nqp and t/hll/06-sprintf.t . That I can do.

[10:01] <nwc10> I'm guessing that this might fix it

[10:02] <patrickb> Thanks for clarifying!
