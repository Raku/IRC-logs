[15:17] <MasterDuke> i think it's because (u)int doesn't have a nativesize, but the explicitly sized native do

[15:18] <MasterDuke> yeah. it's dying here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Buf.pm6#L354

[15:20] <MasterDuke> which makes sense given the bisect https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f98861ad1fc9722ff32f80f011671189d5205d6a#diff-44316ec129e93ec365a4e9c38b642aaf52580b0e3e5936f01675cdc30d2dea43R350

[16:00] <dogbert11> MasterDuke: so this is to be expected then?

[16:06] <MasterDuke> i don't think so
