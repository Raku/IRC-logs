[06:45] <japhb> I am seeing this error a lot recently: P6opaque: no such attribute '$!storage' on type Map in a Hash when trying to bind a value

[06:47] <japhb> The failing line is the declaration of a method.  The weird thing is, I can usually make it go away by adding a throwaway capture ('|c') to the end of the method params.

[06:48] <japhb> Even weirder, it seems to care about the *contents* of the method, even though the workaround affects only the params.

[06:49] <japhb> For example, using a callsame inside a method of a derived class can trigger the error.  *Either* switching the callsame to `self.ParentClass::method` or adding the '|c' to the end of the params makes it go away.

[06:49] <japhb> (All this is from debugging weird behavior in a big mess of class and role definitions, so it's not yet golfed.)

[06:52] <japhb> Annoyingly, simple attempts at golfing like this don't trigger the error:

[06:52] <japhb> m: class Foo { method bar() { say "Foo::bar" } }; class Quux is Foo { method bar() { callsame; say "Quux::bar" } }; Quux.new.bar;

[06:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7152ea59: OUTPUT: «Foo::bar␤Quux::bar␤»

[06:54] <japhb> I even triggered the error in one annoying case by moving some methods from a parent class to an (already-existing) child class nearly unchanged (only module namespace fixes, but otherwise character-identical).

[06:56] <japhb> I've seen the same errors with methods that have empty param lists and methods with rather complex param lists (e.g. both kinds of slurpy, along with multiple other params), so no easy explanation there.

[06:56] <japhb> *both kinds of slurpy --> both positional and associative slurpies

[18:14] <sena_kun> hi folks

[18:15] <sena_kun> I'm writing a post about latest Comma features for the advent calendar, the bit about public ones is done. Should I write some about paid ones or will it be just ads?

[18:17] <[Coke]> fwiw, it's fine with me, as long as it's clearly marked as part of the paid version.

[18:17] <[Coke]> but IANARSCM

[22:09] <lizmat> sena_kun: it's about features, isn't it?  then it's only indirectly advertisement.  And only advertisement in the best way, I'd say

[22:11] <MasterDuke> japhb: nine merged some fixes to moarvm yesterday and lizmat bumped nqp+rakudo, are you getting the errors after those?

[23:16] <japhb> MasterDuke: Yeah, I rebuilt a couple times, and the latest version I saw this problem with was 2021.10-134-gd1bda7b56

[23:24] <MasterDuke> ah, too bad, sounded like something those recent fixes might have helped

[23:48] <japhb> Yeah, I was hoping so myself.
