[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: Fix BEGIN-time calls to bind-check multis

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: 

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: When we have multi candidates with `where` clauses, unpacks, or named

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: arg type checks, we invoke them such that a bind failure will cause a

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: multiple dispatch resumption. If a multi is called at compile time and

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: uses these features, we need to make sure that the candidate is compiled

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: in advance of ever invoking it; otherwise, the thing we invoke is really

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: a compiler thunk, and the resumption on bind failure falsely ends up

[15:02] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/new-disp: applying to it, and is thus hidden from the compiled multi.
