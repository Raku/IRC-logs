[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Refactor Dateish.later/earlier handling

[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - introduces the "move-by-unit" method in Date/DateTime

[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - changes later/earlier methods to be Dateish, calling "move-by-unit"

[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - NQPify DateTime.move-by-unit for better efficiency

[14:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The impetus for this change was mainly to make it easier to add a

[14:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 50% faster for non-second moves.  DateTime.earlier more than that,

[14:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: as it is no longer a shim for .earlier, but for "move-by-unit".
