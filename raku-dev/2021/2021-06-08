[18:40] <sena_kun> releasable6, status

[18:40] <releasable6> sena_kun, Next release in â‰ˆ11 days and â‰ˆ0 hours. 1 blocker. 0 out of 7 commits logged

[18:40] <releasable6> sena_kun, Details: https://gist.github.com/7f2ab6caef128cacb78ea5dd3d6b5df7

[18:41] <sena_kun> hmm, this means no release. :(

[18:59] *** hankache joined
[19:06] <nine> Because of that trivially fixable Windows issue? That's sad

[19:09] <sena_kun> nine, no really, even with this issue fixed we will have basically 5 commits for the next release. I am not sure what should be the policy for this. Technically we can do a monthly release as long as there is a single commit changing something, but hmm.

[19:09] <sena_kun> s/no/not/

[19:09] <nine> Well it's still 11 days to the release

[19:09] <MasterDuke> nine's prs making compiling nativecall stuff should be merged

[19:10] <MasterDuke> *making ... faster

[19:10] <sena_kun> yes, those are really cool

[19:11] <sena_kun> maybe I used a very poor wording to state what I wanted. :S It is not "I won't do a release this month", but more of "The release cycle is more intense than the development at this rate".

[19:15] *** hankache left
[19:18] <japhb> I think this is a side effect of lots of the dev work happening in branches, most of which aren't merged yet.

[19:19] <japhb> With 11 days left, it feels like a long enough window for merge-and-get-broader-testing for some things.
