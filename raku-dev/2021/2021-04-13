[11:39] <tbrowder> howdy

[11:40] <tbrowder> i'm working with core DateTime code and am getting setting issues when doing "make test". where should i look to fix the issue?

[11:41] <tbrowder> afaik, i've not changed any signatures, although i have added two "my subs"

[11:43] <tbrowder> i could try moving the two subs inside the using block.

[11:43] <tbrowder> but would rather not unless necessary

[11:45] <tbrowder> the basic change is inside one of the new methods (epoch) where i make a separate path for entered epoch values < zero

[11:46] <tbrowder> i'll push what i have if someone could please take a look...

[11:50] <tbrowder> see PR #4324

[11:51] <tbrowder> the issues are with core settings during "make test"

[11:52] *** domidumont joined
[11:54] <tbrowder> hm, do all vars in the block have to be bound?

[12:11] <tbrowder> just bound another fwiw, no change in test results

[20:46] * lizmat just posted https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4325

[21:08] <lizmat> m: class A is Str { method foo() { dd } }; my constant Str = A; my $a = "bar"; $a.foo   # vely nice

[21:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 596ccef3b: OUTPUT: «method foo(A: *%_)␤»

[21:09] <lizmat> nine: however, when I put A into a module, and export the A class as Str, it *doesn't* work, any idea how that can be ?

[21:54] <lizmat> nwc10: it's too simple for that  :-)

[21:54] <lizmat> still  :-)
