[12:23] <bartolin_> nine: I'm seeing some test failures for deprecation reports, e.g. in https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/18d801ba49/S02-types/isDEPRECATED.t#L136. The report now mentions the method DEPRECATION itself (from CORE.c.setting). Could it be that decreasing the start index for Backtrace.next-interesting-index should have been done for MoarVM only? (I mean the change to src/core.c/Deprecations.pm6 in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2e79780e4a )

[12:43] <dogbert17> it does look a bit slurpy yes

[13:24] <bartolin_> nine: ^^ maybe it's easy-ish to allow nqp::backtrace(nqp::null) on the JVM backend, too. I'll run a spectest over night. But if I'm not wrong, we'd still have to add a special case to src/core.c/Deprecations.pm6 -- but only for the js backend.
