[09:18] <Altai-man> indeed, thanks to everyone who has helped

[09:19] <Altai-man> patrickb, I'll do a blin run today to ensure the master is good to release and run various tests to skip them tomorrow (will release from a weak machine again)

[09:19] <Altai-man> patrickb, when you'll be around to watch over the releasing?

[09:20] <patrickb> o/

[09:21] <patrickb> Altai-man: Today I'll be available the entire day and evening. Tomorrow I'll be available in the evening and possibly in the late afternoon

[09:21] <Altai-man> patrickb, alright, makes sense to me. please, ping me tomorrow whenever you'll be available to start

[09:22] <patrickb> Will do!

[09:22] <patrickb> I'll merge https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4448 as soon as CI is done. Should not affect any testing, as it's only changes to the release tooling.

[09:23] <patrickb> Also do you think it's realistic to wrap up https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4455 before the release?

[09:25] <Altai-man> patrickb, I do, alas did not have time to check it out properly (I glanced and it seemed fine), the time is kinda scarce those days. Actually, I think we can merge it and try out this release, it's just about new steps in the script, and if something is bad we can patch it on the place.

[09:28] <patrickb> The interesting part is which checksum format we settle on. I think it would be good to be sure the format we choose is good, so we don't have to change it later on, as that can break tooling of users.

[09:29] <Altai-man> patrickb, alas, I have no knowledge of this sort. :/

[09:29] <patrickb> That's why I had asked for feedback, insights of others, as I don't have a feel for what the state of the art / trend is...

[09:29] <patrickb> Maybe it doesn't really matter that much...

[09:53] <raydiak> just a heads-up wrt the blin failure in Pod::To::HTMLBody, we forked the module into the community repo and fixed the test, but then noticed that it's actually published on CPAN so we can't immediately switch over to the fork. either way, it's not an issue with rakudo so safe to ignore
