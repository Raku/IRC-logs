[06:51] <patrickb> Re Removing the depenency on Perl in our builds. I don't see much of a problem with depending on Perl. As long as we don't manage to depend on a tool we'll compile ourself (we do already compile our own mini-lua in the moar build, so a build chain written in lua would fit that criteria), we'll always have to install some third party tool.

[13:20] <MasterDuke> nice
[13:20] <nine> lizmat: there's a way to trigger a Github Webhook again - useful for testing bots.
[13:20] <lizmat> well, I assumed there was, but I couldn't find it  :-(
[13:21] <lizmat> careful UI design
[13:22] <lizmat> aaah...  found it
[13:24] <lizmat> except that it doesn't work :-(

[13:26] <lizmat> apparently only new ones :-(
[13:26] <lizmat> I guess I first need to change the webhooks everywhere
[13:27] <lizmat> the new server is "webhooks.liz.nl", and that's the only thing that needs changing
[13:31] <lizmat> Geth: help
[13:31] <Geth> lizmat, Source at https://github.com/Raku/geth To add repo, add an 'application/json' webhook on GitHub pointing it to https://webhooks.liz.nl/?chan=%23raku and choose 'Send me everything' for events to send | use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes
[13:31] <lizmat> FWIW, this is running at HEAD~1
[13:51] <lizmat> I think I covered the webhooks in all of the important repos now, please let me know if you think I missed one
