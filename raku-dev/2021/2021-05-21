[18:57] <MasterDuke> linkable6 isn't working for some reason

[18:57] <tellable6> hey MasterDuke, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/94347f414c95299aab5fff6b733bc5f6

[19:07] <AlexDaniel`> Did some bots go down again or something?

[19:07] <AlexDaniel`> Only ipv6 ones online?

[19:09] <MasterDuke> linkable6 hasn't been working for a while

[19:10] <AlexDaniel`> Hmmm

[19:20] <AlexDaniel`> MoarVM panic: Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 12210683904 bytes

[19:20] <japhb> AlexDaniel`: Just a wild guess: Upgraded to new IRC::Client without doing https://www.tyil.nl/post/2021/05/13/a-new-irc-client/ ?

[19:21] *** linkable6 joined
[19:21] <tyil> japhb: that shouldn't cause this much issue D:

[19:21] <tyil> japhb: also, the new IRC::Client isn't on the ecosystem yet because I don't want stuff like this to happen to everyone :p

[19:21] <tyil> so I'm taking my time in testing it out as much as I can

[19:22] <AlexDaniel`> ‚ÄúThis allows for faster execution, and for multiple plugins to handle an event without having to use $*NEXT‚Äù

[19:22] <AlexDaniel`> right

[19:23] <AlexDaniel`> no, not feeling like going through all the bots to change all of them

[19:23] <tyil> and you don't have to ;)

[19:23] <AlexDaniel`> pull requests welcome though

[19:23] <tyil> that's the beauty of the ecosystem, you can just pin on whatever version you prefer

[19:24] <tyil> I'm already happy that Geth isn't in need of a restart every day anymore

[19:24] <AlexDaniel`> I don't see any beauty in getting stuck with an old version because the new one is drastically incompatible

[19:24] <AlexDaniel`> but OK

[19:25] <AlexDaniel`> This is Rakudo version 2020.02.1-395-g2c9168b9a built on MoarVM version 2020.02.1-162-g3d8ff61e2

[19:25] <AlexDaniel`> implementing Raku 6.d.

[19:25] <tyil> the old version has served you well from what I can tell

[19:25] <tyil> if you dont like the new version, you're not forced to use it

[19:26] <tyil> it hasn't served me (that) well, and nobody else was going to do any work on it, so I fixed what issues I had with it

[19:26] <AlexDaniel`> anyway let's jump one year ahead and see if that fixes the issue‚Ä¶

[19:35] <japhb> AlexDaniel`: Yeah, there's been a lot of stability improvements during that time.

[19:35] <japhb> tyil: Understood, didn't realize it wasn't in the ecosystem yet.

[19:38] <tyil> no worries :>

[19:38] <AlexDaniel`> The --git-reference option does not exist anymore.

[19:38] <AlexDaniel`> Consider using --git-cache-dir instead.

[19:39] <AlexDaniel`> is it just a rename or something else changed?

[19:41] <sena_kun> vrurg++

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> OK, so here's how the bot works

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> it looks for users joining it, and it waits for 45 seconds before giving them voice

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> if they speak faster, then they're considered to be a bot

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> most users don't speak right away. This worked great in the past, we had this bot live for weeks if not months
