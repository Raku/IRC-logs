[11:55] <lizmat> m: dd "foo---bar".subst(/ "-"+ /, "-", :exhaustive)   # hmmmm

[12:01] <lizmat> ok, this is getting weird: am I missing something?

[12:02] <lizmat> m: dd "foo---bar".subst(/ "-"+ /, "-", :global)

[12:02] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «"foo-bar"␤»

[12:02] <lizmat> moritz ^^

[12:05] <lizmat> aaaahhh

[12:06] <lizmat> an EN DASH slipped in there

[12:09] <nine> Ah why can't camelia be written in Raku? Half an hour and I still can't get it to connect to Freenode via IPv6, while IO::Socket::INET.new(:host<irc.freenode.org>, :port(6667)); works on the first try in Raku :/

[12:11] <lizmat> nine: All for having camelia run in Raku

[12:11] <lizmat> tbh I thought it already did

[12:11] <nwc10> nine: start by rewriting the network part in Raku, and run the rest via Iline?

[12:11] <nine> Well I guess "camelia written in Raku" is what evalable6 is

[12:12] <AlexDaniel`> exactly

[12:12] <lizmat> so this could be as simple as renaming evalable6 to camelia?

[12:12] <AlexDaniel`> pretty much, although evalable6 behaves a little bit different

[12:12] <AlexDaniel`> but we can change it

[12:13] <AlexDaniel`> for example, what do you want to happen in case of very long output?

[12:13] <AlexDaniel`> evalable6 gists, camelia used to truncate and that's it

[12:14] <AlexDaniel`> as I mentioned before, I'll be working on whateverables this month

[12:14] <AlexDaniel`> mostly on dockerizing, but if you have any other suggestions then I can do whatever you want

[12:15] <AlexDaniel`> note that the goal of dockerizing the bots is to eventually move them out of my server

[12:15] <AlexDaniel`> so hosting both camelia and evalable6 in the end may be a bit redundant

[12:18] *** camelia joined
[12:19] <nine> So it came down to putting the IPv6 address into the config instead of a host name, even if the host name only has an AAAA entry (like irc.ipv6.freenode.net)

[12:20] <nine> Perl--

[12:20] <AlexDaniel`> hehe, whateverable also has some IPs hardcoded I think, to avoid the max connection limit per ip :)

[12:21] <AlexDaniel`> m: say 42

[12:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[12:21] <AlexDaniel`> \o/

[12:21] <AlexDaniel`> thank you, evalable6, you're a good friend :)

[12:21] <evalable6> AlexDaniel`, \o/
