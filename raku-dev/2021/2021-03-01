[09:41] <nine> Is the files method even a public API? There's only a single use of it in a spec test and that doesn't specify much except that the return value has an .elems method (which every Any does)

[12:30] <ugexe> How else could one find bin files?

[12:30] <ugexe> they don’t get declared in the Meta other than the implementation detail field ‘files’

[12:30] <ugexe> that zef sets

[12:32] <ugexe> So you can’t just iterate all distributions looking for a specific bin file without also using that implementation detail field

[12:32] <ugexe> .files is the thus the public api to that 

[12:33] <ugexe> Or that’s how I’ve always seen it anyway 

[12:53] <nine> isn't finding that bin file something that's mostly relevant to rakudo itself?

[14:42] <ugexe> i've written prototype plugin code similar to what japhb suggestd using .files

[14:46] <ugexe> one example would allow dists to provide a bin/zef-foo which would allow `zef foo ...` to call that `bin/zef-foo` but essentially via a `require $file` (similar to .run-script). this allows all the zef config stuff etc to be used in that code which wouldn't be the case with bin/zef just spawning bin/zef-foo

[14:47] <ugexe> i realize thats a bit eccentric though

[16:43] <MasterDuke> uh, does anyone else see fails in t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.rakudo.moar? tests 157 and 158

[16:45] <lizmat> I've seen that fail occasionally

[16:45] <lizmat> a re-compile usually fixed it

[16:47] <MasterDuke> those tests are just the number of frames in a backtrace, how would a recompile change anything? i thought it was my spesh changes, but it's the same even with spesh disabled

[16:48] <lizmat> ok, then it must be another pair of tests

[16:48] <lizmat> sorry for the noise

[16:48] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, does it flap for you?

[16:49] <MasterDuke> well, it was always failing each time i ran it, but those are new fails for me

[16:49] <MasterDuke> recompiling

[16:49] <sena_kun> Ah, so something which can be absent on master.

[16:49] <sena_kun> Don't forget to add it to the flappers ticket please, if you see it fitting. :)

[16:49] <MasterDuke> well, look at the bisectable6 log above, seems it should have been failing for a while now

[16:51] <MasterDuke> just switched back to moarvm master and still getting the fails

[16:58] <MasterDuke> ha. on moarvm master, `make t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.t` passes, but `MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 make t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.t` has those two fails

[16:59] <MasterDuke> those tests were reverted once already as dubious, and then re-reverted. maybe that needs to be looked into again
