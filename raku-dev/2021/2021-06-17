[08:30] <lizmat> nine ugexe Looking at RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG output, what does "Repo changed: ...  need to re-check dependencies" mean?

[08:31] <lizmat> same for repo chain changed

[08:32] <lizmat> looks like I cannot load a module without getting that message, even though I think nothing has changed in the filesystem?

[08:32] <lizmat> or in $*REPO ?

[08:42] <lizmat> like: RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 raku -MTest -e ''

[08:57] <lizmat> m: sub ztask( (:$key, :$value) ) {}; ztask ‘foo’.any => ‘bar’;

[08:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar cd4a72b6a: OUTPUT: «(timeout)»

[08:57] <lizmat> oh no, I killed camelia  :-)

[09:01] <nine> lizmat: repo chain changed means basically that anything (any file) in any repository was changed

[09:03] <lizmat> well, that's the thing: I cannot load Test without it claiming stuff has changed

[09:04] <lizmat> so I have this feeling that dependencies are re-checked always, even when they shouldn't be ?

[09:05] <nine> Do you have anything in PERL6LIB or the like?

[09:06] <lizmat> you mean, do I have PERL6LIB set ?

[09:06] <nine> yes

[09:06] <nine> or RAKULIB or whatever we have nowadays

[09:06] <lizmat> set | grep LIB    # empty

[09:07] <MasterDuke> i can repro

[09:08] <nine> indeed

[09:09] <MasterDuke> in an empty directory, no PERL6LIB or RAKUDOLIB set. `RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 raku -MTest -e ''` always prints `1 RMD: Repo changed:

[09:09] <MasterDuke>           259C64E6436199E645AFDA4E251CCB6B06645979

[09:09] <MasterDuke>           04FF7FA21BD02F44E1BF654112C732727558877F

[09:09] <MasterDuke>         Need to re-check dependencies.

[09:09] <MasterDuke>  1 RMD: Repo chain changed:

[09:09] <MasterDuke>           259C64E6436199E645AFDA4E251CCB6B06645979

[09:09] <MasterDuke>           04FF7FA21BD02F44E1BF654112C732727558877F

[09:09] <MasterDuke>         Need to re-check dependencies.`

[09:09] <lizmat> yup, that's what I'm also seeing

[09:10] <nine> Can you bisect?

[09:10] <nine> That definitely needs fixing

[09:11] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: isn't there a way to set env variables with bisectable? aside from using run

[09:21] <MasterDuke> nine, lizmat: ^^^ 

[09:22] <lizmat> ah... maybe I missed a s/Perl6/Raku somewhere ?

[09:25] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L1496 maybe?

[09:26] <lizmat> MasterDuke: will check, thanks for the bisect!

[09:26] <lizmat> and the research

[09:26] <MasterDuke> np

[09:30] <nine> A surprising find for sure....

[09:30] <nine> lizmat: thanks for noticing!

[09:31] <lizmat> interesting failure mode:

[09:31] <lizmat> Could not find CompUnit::Repository::Staging:from<Raku> in:

[09:32] <lizmat> guess I need to find other places as wel

[09:34] <MasterDuke> there are a couple other places in src/core.c/CompUnit.pm6, src/core.c/CompUnit/DependencySpecification.pm6, src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/FileSystem.pm6. and src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/Installation.pm6 that look suspicious

[09:40] <lizmat> changing those as well makes it install the core modules ok

[09:40] <lizmat> but doesn't change the underlying issue :(

[09:40] <lizmat> let's see how this spectests  :-)

[09:51] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/48de177274

[09:51] <lizmat> but does not fix the dependencies issues

[09:52] <lizmat> it does strike me as odd that the first sha1 is *always* 012C8077823C618E079285B919C33704B32C9F97 ?

[09:52] <lizmat> (at least for me)

[09:55] <MasterDuke> i have a different value, but yes, it's always the same
