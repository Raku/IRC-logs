[01:17] <timo> https://www.raku.org/compilers/ - may want to be changed to also include rakudo-js by now?

[01:19] <timo> my rakudo-appimage project was taken out for now by the travis .org -> .com move, if someone wants to walk me through replacing that with github actions or something, that'd be cool

[15:27] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/new-disp:
