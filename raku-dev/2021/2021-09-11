[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Properly handle List of Lists in List.fmt

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: There were several things wrong with this, as Daniel Sockwell spotted

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69137422/confusing-fmt-behavior-with-nested-lists

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: But basically it boiled down to Lists within Lists not being .fmtted

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: with the correct separator.

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: <…commit message has 8 more lines…>

[19:59] <ugexe> codesections: i realized i never merged the PR with those more precise version imports in zef

[19:59] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/pull/334/files

[20:03] <ugexe> BEGIN my $ZVER = $?DISTRIBUTION.meta<version>;

[20:03] <ugexe> use Zef:ver($ZVER);

[20:03] <ugexe> ^ is basically the pattern you can do with current rakudo

[20:07] <lizmat> how would that affect testing with -Ilib ?

[20:07] <lizmat> ah, not, because :ver is ignored by the use lib repo handler anyway, right?

[20:12] <ugexe> since there is no META6.json in a lib directory (i assume anyway) it would get version * which might as well act as an infinite version. -I. might point at a META6.json and it would extract the version as one might expect

[20:13] <lizmat> ah, good point  :-)

[20:13] <ugexe> in both cases the -I puts the repo in front of the core rakudo repos (like site), so -I. might have version 1 and site might have version 2, but version 1 gets picked anyway

[20:16] <ugexe> "an infinite version" would be a little better stated as "all versions including infinity"

[20:20] <ugexe> https://deathbyperl6.com/perl-toolchain-summit-2018-meta6-dependency-hello/ -- "Allow structured dependency format" describes the alternative way of writing the dependency format that zef already understands

[20:24] <lizmat> ah, the one we couldn't make it to  :-)
