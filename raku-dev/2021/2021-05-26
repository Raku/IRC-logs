[09:18] <lizmat> raydiak: true, but disturbing nonetheless
[09:26] <raydiak> definitely agree, just adding context. the broader scope makes it even more disturbing to me, for the most part. if it was just us I'd be personally offended but also a little proud tbh
[09:27] <raydiak> as it is I was disturbed enough to write a two paragraph comment on it
[09:35] <raydiak> (and fwiw, that's saying a lot. it takes nearly an act of God to get me to register a non-essential account these days, much less actually post a comment)
[09:42] <lizmat> raydiak: wow
[09:43] <lizmat> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27287864
[09:45] <raydiak> yes that one...his comment is flagged now, but originally had a bunch of nonsense about how they were just cleaning out inactive unmoderated rooms for violating the new rules and he was sorry for the poor communication or some such spineless nonsense
[09:47] <lizmat> I like the idea of Freenode now should be called "Leenode"
[09:47] <lizmat> although maybe the Linode people might object :)
[09:48] <sjn> that's some feisty language! :-)
[09:49] <raydiak> I was admittedly a little fired up, but I don't regret it :)
[09:50] <raydiak> I saw the Leenode thing too! that's pretty funny

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: colabti is now pointing at libera, if you need it
[21:46] <MasterDuke> ah, nice
[21:46] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: start of the day is from freenode (with very sad messages), but the rest is libera
[21:46] <AlexDaniel> I didn't expect them to take over raku channels, what in the actual f
[21:47] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: also, something you might be interested in, is using irc through Matrix
[21:47] <AlexDaniel> this way no need for logs, follow the conversations from your phone if you want to
[21:48] <AlexDaniel> matrix.org ↔ libera bridge is meant to be up tomorrow
[21:48] <MasterDuke> doesn't matrix require an actual stand-alone client? i've always used the kiwi web client for irc
[21:52] <AlexDaniel> you can use a browser client
[21:52] <AlexDaniel> https://element.io/get-started has “open in your browser” button :)
[21:53] <AlexDaniel> and it's not just some client, it's the most featureful one
[21:53] <AlexDaniel> the desktop version is literally the same thing in electron

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> didn't do anything really, just changed the url for the bots to connect to, and pinged nine to ping feb on #irclogger to switch to libera
[22:36] <AlexDaniel> let me know if we start to see spam though, I can set up a bot again
[22:36] <AlexDaniel> the trick with +mz worked pretty good
