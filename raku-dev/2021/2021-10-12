[13:22] <[Coke]> does rakubrew save builds? If I do a triple with three specific commits, then re-use two of them, can it avoid rebuilding the one that didnt' change?
[13:23] <[Coke]> (trying to get a script I can run on windows that keeps trying latest for all three but is smart enough to not wipe out moar and rebuild it if only rakudo has changed, etc.

[14:13] <patrickb> it does run `Configure.pl --install` every time. It doesn't run `make clean` though. So it rebuilds every time, but reuses some build artifacts IIUC.
[14:16] <patrickb> Nah, that wasn't true.
