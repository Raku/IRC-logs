[00:52] <timo> it should only be like 20% more time spent starting up, or i guess maybe everything that's kind of "warming" up is a bit slower at the moment?

[00:52] <timo> anyway, we'll "claw" that performance back :)

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: Cache flat method tables on meta-objects

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: 

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: We produce these in the situation that a dispatch is going megamorphic

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: and we want to handle that by doing a hash lookup on method names. In

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: the case that there are also loads of types, we currently fill up the

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: callsite cache with an entry per encountered type (this needs to be

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: addressed). Once it fills, we'd end up recalculating this table over and

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: over again. Further, even in the non-full cache case, we could calculate

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: and install it at many sites, which is a waste of time and memory. Thus,

[10:36] <Geth> ¦ nqp: calculate it once and share it among the various caches.
