[11:07] <Kaiepi> even if it is, it results in a slower build, so i'm not sure it favours the types in the setting, let alone the ecosystem

[11:27] <Kaiepi> so it follows making the parametric role and its group consider parents first should be helpful, which reduces build times and looks to be efficient enough for Buf[uint8] ~~ Blob[uint8] not to take much of a hit

[12:31] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo/new-disp: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9c83541e2c

[12:33] <sena_kun> was there a new-disp rebase recently? I see a lot of commits are now split to be authored/committed and I also don't see my bump commits in the history of new-disp at all?

[12:40] <nine> sena_kun: yes, I rebased the branch on Sunday

[12:41] <nine> I may have lost those bumps when solving merge conflicts. Sorry about that

[12:42] <sena_kun> nine, no problem, just confirmed, thanks.

[12:46] *** patrickb left
[14:31] *** frost left
[14:33] <[Coke]> ... are those bumps correct for the new rebase?

[14:33] <[Coke]> I just updated moarvm, built, installed, moved to nqp, updated, built... moar too old.

[14:34] <[Coke]> (found 395, needed 397)

[14:34] <sena_kun> [Coke], that's weird. whateverable built an image just fine and I am finishing a blin run with it?

[14:34] <sena_kun> [Coke], can you try just rakudo with `--gen-moar --gen-nqp`?

[14:36] <[Coke]> I don't want the defaults, I want latest.

[14:38] <[Coke]> ... oh. the version number is pulled during config, isn't it. Ugh.

[14:38] <[Coke]> Ok, will start from scratch.

[14:38] <sena_kun> [Coke], in case of MoarVM my new-disp branch has the latest commit 5f563ba1a0a21becb41a9dc1534ac95fb64148d2. git describe returns me `2021.07-397-g5f563ba1a`, is it different for you?

[14:39] <sena_kun> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commits/new-disp agrees with me, no?

[14:53] <[Coke]> it's not different. the issue is that when I updated, I just did an 'nmake install', which does NOT rerun the git describe check.

[14:54] <sena_kun> [Coke], so is it fixed now or?

[14:55] <[Coke]> I need to do a full reconfig and test.

[14:55] <[Coke]> Will take me a little bit, but I'm sure it'll be fine.

[14:55] <sena_kun> great then

[15:07] <vrurg> Actually, there is something wrong with versions. Seemingly, new-disp moar and nqp has lesser versions, than the one from master. I had to supply Configure.pl with --force-rebuild, but still ended up with removing nqp/ and install/ and clean rebuild.

[15:12] <[Coke]> ISTR force-rebuild didn't do what I wanted.

[15:13] <[Coke]> so yes, when I want to really force a rebuild, I end up doing rm -rf install/ nqp/ and re-configuring.

[15:14] <vrurg> For now I consider it as glitches of switching between different branches. But when new-disp is ready for becoming the mainline, there are likely rough edges to be resolved.

[15:21] <[Coke]> huh. build seems to hang on windows on master.

[15:21] <[Coke]> (inside of nqp)

[16:02] <[Coke]> sena_kun: yup, with a full reconfig, it's fine

[16:02] <sena_kun> yay

[16:02] <sena_kun> at least it wasn't wrong, phew. :)

[16:02] <sena_kun> sorry to take your time with this

[17:15] <[Coke]> no worries!

[17:15] <[Coke]> It's not you, it's weird 3-tier build system. :)

[20:10] <gfldex> Should Rakudo::Internals::LoweredAwayLexical leak in v6.e? (I'm fooling around with CLIENT::LEXICAL.)

[20:25] <vrurg> gfldex: It may. Why not? The symbol exists, despite of the downgrade.

[20:31] <gfldex> I would like to get the value begind that symbol instead of Rakudo::Internals::LoweredAwayLexical .
