[15:50] <gfldex> should wrap on an individual method wrap on that method or the proto?

[15:55] <lizmat> I would say on that candidate ?

[15:55] <lizmat> if it doesn't... well, that would feel weird to me

[15:56] <lizmat> otoh, maybe that's intentional, because of callsame and friends handling

[15:56] <lizmat> jnthn might know

[15:59] <gfldex> It wraps the proto. Not hard to handle that case but it's still an ENODOC.

[21:07] <patrickb> I just did a `make spectest` in a rakudo branch and got some errors all semingly unrelated and a load of passed todos. Is that expected?

[21:12] <patrickb> This is the result of the run: https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/a1714fbd5dd23ea7f84647ae936eb7c5

[21:12] <patrickb> Yeah, that run took nearly 40 minutes :-/

[21:17] <[Coke]> patrickb: what OS?

[21:17] <patrickb> linux

[21:18] <[Coke]> I am not sure if practically that's expected, but theoretically, I would think linux would have a pretty strict everything should be passing and anything passing shouldn't be TODO'd (but other oses might lag one way or the other)

[21:18] <[Coke]> .. do we have something jenkins like keeping track of these as we update roast/release rakudo?

[21:20] <patrickb> I don't think so. Our CIs don't currently do roast...

[21:26] <gfldex> I wonder if :batch in hyper/race should depend on .elems. Pretty much every time I hyper I use :1000batch.

[22:08] <patrickb> I think I solved my spectest mystery. I had it checked out at a custom branch which broke auto update of the spec repo during `make spectest`.

[22:56] <patrickb> I'd value a set of eyes on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4154
