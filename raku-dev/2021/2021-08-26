[08:26] <lizmat> $ fez upload

[08:26] <lizmat> =<< Failed to determine git branch=<< Failed to run git archive: fatal: not a valid object name:>>= Looking in "sdist/EctYW8EF.tar.gz" for META6.json

[08:26] <lizmat> after that it tells me I've uploaded correctly

[08:26] <lizmat> tonyo_ ugexe  ^^

[08:28] <lizmat> I guess I also have a feature request: I would like to keep a local copy of the tar that got uploaded ?

[11:59] <lizmat> tonyo_ ugexe looks like the "eigenstates" I uploaded with fez, is not being indexed, or it is incorrectly telling me it successfully uploaded

[12:03] *** reportable6 left
[12:08] <lizmat> hmmm... now I get a mail with: Meta error: "auth" must be zef:

[16:05] <tonyo_> so in the meta your auth should be `"auth": "zef:lizmat"`

[16:05] <tonyo_> the fez tool is just telling you it uploaded correctly, email is how any errors arrive

[16:05] <lizmat>   "auth": "zef:lizmat",

[16:05] <lizmat> is what it says ?

[16:06] <tonyo_> if it's in a git repo and uses git to bundle everything then it might be using whatever is committed to the branch

[16:09] <lizmat> so I made sure all is committed

[16:09] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/eigenstates

[16:09] <lizmat> and even pushed

[17:04] <tonyo_> are you uploading with fez itself or deploying via mi6?

[17:08] <tonyo_> if you're using the `fez upload` can you pass `fez upload --save-autobundle` and upload the tar/gz somewhere i can take a look at it?

[17:08] <lizmat> could I deploy with mi6 ?
