[18:25] <jdv> anyone else having trouble installing whateverable?  it worked a couple weeks ago i think.

[18:27] <lizmat> what problems do you see?

[18:28] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/e490ecf38afcfcc94f183624bcbb900b

[18:30] <jdv> 2x so probably not transient

[18:32] <ugexe> https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/commit/f8955b248e82e6bb35ea7b6ec7015c0b9639b3ea#diff-ed5c10babba5a16dd251cedebb96631a8e1e9d3644712e7df37a75e98c5e41b5

[18:35] <ugexe> ye olde version pinning

[18:37] <lizmat> oh dear, I borked something?

[18:39] <ugexe> whateverable does 'use IRC::Client::Message'

[18:39] <lizmat> where does Whateverable live again?

[18:39] <ugexe> https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/blob/f7f301303aed2d0dea57cc5b939eb2faf25ec598/lib/Whateverable/Discordable.pm6#L17

[18:41] <lizmat> I see 2 solutions:

[18:41] <lizmat> either pin the use statement to :ver<4.0.0>

[18:42] <lizmat> or drop the "::Message" part in the use statement

[18:45] <lizmat> or wait until I've made IRC::Client provide IRC::Client::Message again

[18:46] <jdv> i guess it depends when will that happen

[18:49] *** Xliff joined
[18:51] <ugexe> you could also probably just manually install an old version of IRC::Client

[18:51] <ugexe> then install whateverable

[18:51] <jdv> yeah, i'll try to pin it for now, thanks

[18:51] <ugexe> should uninstall both of them first

[18:52] <jdv> its part of a docker build

[18:55] <lizmat> jdv: working on it now

[19:06] <lizmat> jdv: IRC::Client 4.0.5 now in the ecosystem

[19:31] <lizmat> jdv: can you confirm this fixes the Whateverable issue ?

[19:36] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[19:36] <notable6> lizmat, No notes for “weekly”

[19:53] <jdv> it doesn't seem to.  i pinned it for now and that worked.

[19:59] <lizmat> jdv: gist ?

[20:00] <lizmat> ok

[20:01] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/67f6499e71eaeb548b174008d70503db

[20:06] <lizmat> interesting...

[20:06] <lizmat> since you're up and running now, I'll check on it tomorrow again

[20:06] * lizmat will try to finish the Weekly first now

[20:07] <jdv> thanks

[21:05] <lizmat> interesting... seems like the PING timeout logic needs to reset the timer when the bot talks

[23:10] <MasterDuke> is there a way to use the built-in grammar tokens, e.g., <dec_number>?
