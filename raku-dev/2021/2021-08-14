[16:20] <nine> "The real test of a community is not the discovery of those elements, but its reaction to them—particularly its willingness to acknowledge them. So far, the Perl community seems to be failing that test."

[16:20] <nine> I do hope that the verdict for the Raku community will sound very differently

[16:55] <leont> They missed at least two (silent) resignations, not that I'm going to correct them on that :-/

[19:22] <[Coke]> Guess I got out while the getting was good.

[19:24] <[Coke]> should not have started reading the comments.

[20:01] <vrurg> releasable6: status

[20:01] <releasable6> vrurg, Next release in ≈6 days and ≈22 hours. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[20:01] <releasable6> vrurg, Details: https://gist.github.com/81070366832c885c91c425fc7b73a2ed

[20:03] <MasterDuke> i think that one is actually just 'test needed' now, right?

[20:20] <vrurg> If you mean #4456, looks like it is.

[20:22] * vrurg is in doubt if it worth merging #4492 and see if Blin strikes back after that.
