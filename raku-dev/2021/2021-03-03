[15:40] <patrickbkr[m]> Just in case nobody noticed: There is the gtk interface project of martimm which iirc does utilize automatic generation, even though not based on gir, I think.

[15:54] <Xliff_> vrurg: LOL! Hey, I'll take it.

[15:54] *** Xliff_ is now known as Xliff

[15:55] <Xliff> sena_kun++ # Thanks!

[16:07] <patrickbkr[m]> Xliff: What hinders to just ignore the high compile times and release the projects to the ecosystem anyways?

[16:10] <Xliff> patrickbkr[m]: IOt'

[16:10] <Xliff> patrickbkr[m]: It's not the high compile times, per se.t

[16:10] <Xliff> s/t$//

[16:10] <Xliff> It's the lack of installer response.

[16:11] <Xliff> The current CURI installer does not give enough user feedback for me to feel comfortable with releasing the code.

[16:11] <Xliff> 2 minuts of blank screen is bad enough. 5 minutes is interminable, and 10 minutes of no feedback would make most users (corretly) assume that something was broken.

[16:12] <patrickbkr[m]> Hm. So some progressbar-y thing for zef would make you happy?

[16:12] <Xliff> Yes.

[16:13] <patrickbkr[m]> OK. Understood. Thanks for the info. Xliff++

[16:14] <Xliff> patrickbkr[m]: Even a periodic hook with the current installer status exposed would be helpful.

[16:16] <sena_kun> patrickbkr[m], remembering some discussions, I imagine the hook with something progressbar-y has to be provided by rakudo first.

[16:26] <ugexe> I still don't see whats wrong with RAKUDO_LOG_PRECOMP=1

[16:27] <ugexe> its intended to tell you (from rakudo itself) when its installing each file and precomping each file

[16:27] <ugexe> if its not doing that then something is probably wrong

[16:27] <ugexe> but i've mentioned this before so i assume it doesnt work for some reason?

[16:28] <ugexe> s/rakudo itself/curi itself/

[16:30] <MasterDuke> i'd completely forgotten that was an option

[16:33] *** vrurg left
[16:40] <patrickbkr[m]> I guess it works fine. But it's not as end-user approachable compared to e.g. a `--progress` flag.
