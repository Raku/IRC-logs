[14:06] <lizmat> meh, just found out that the iterator intended to be used for "do loop {  }" is actually not used at all  :-(
[14:07] <lizmat> but removing is not an option, as it is explictely called in a spectest in a bogus way :-(
[14:07] <MasterDuke> how old/new is the spectest?
[14:09] <lizmat> about a year old
[14:09] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&
