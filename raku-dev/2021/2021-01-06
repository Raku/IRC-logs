[10:17] <Xliff> In MoarVM's Configure.Pl, even with "--debug" I am getting "-O3 -DNDEBUG" in my CFLAGS. Is this intentional? 

[10:17] <Xliff> If not, can "--debug" turn these flags off?

[10:17] <Xliff> Thanks.

[10:18] <nine> Xliff: run with --debug --optimize=0

[10:18] <MasterDuke> i usually do --debug=3, but i don't know exactly how much of a difference the =3 makes

[10:32] <patrickb> .tell tony-o Did you know JRaspass and JJAtria[m] are working on a pure-Raku modules.raku.org replacement? You should probably start a conversation on how to best integrate the fez ecosystem.

[10:32] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tony-o

[10:33] <JRaspass> i saw that, i resume auth would be fez:xxx rather than cpan:xxx or github:xxx, etc?

[10:33] <JRaspass> *presume

[10:33] *** frost-lab left
[10:33] <patrickb> JRaspass: Give me a moment. I can look that up.

[10:34] <JRaspass> no rush, git{hub,lab} etc doesn't even work yet ðŸ˜‚

[10:36] <patrickb> The ecosystem itself is currently called `zef`. A p6c mirror is also available called `zef-p6c`.

[10:38] <patrickb> I have very high hopes for this new ecosystem. So I'm very interested to have this integrated in a modules index website (especially because modules.raku.org does not yet support the new zef eco)

[10:40] <patrickb> JRaspass: More explicitly the auths will be called zef:xxx and zef-p6c:xxx. See https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/blob/master/lib/Fez/CLI.rakumod#L23

[10:41] <JRaspass> so p6c is ecosystem/META.list, and zef-p6c is a mirror of that?

[10:42] *** frost-lab joined
[10:42] <patrickb> Correct.

[10:42] <JRaspass> yeah and the auth on those (http://32.zef.pm) seems to be like i'd expect, github:xxx, gitlab:xxx, etc.

[10:43] <JRaspass> so i could use that mirror to avoid fetching all the meta files but in practice im planning to have all the git checkouts so i can ingest markdown, git tags, etc

[10:44] <JRaspass> looks fun though, needs SSL ;-)

[10:44] <JRaspass> oh it has it, just no redir

[10:44] <patrickb> If I understand correctly, zef-p6c automatically tunes the META files to fix a problem with those. Not sure about the details though.

[10:47] <patrickb> The new eco is in development still. So things are still changing.

[10:47] <JRaspass> same for raku land ;-)

[10:48] <patrickb> I'd love to see you guys get in contact and push raku land and the zef eco forward together. :-)

[10:51] <JRaspass> so i know that over in the perl land cpanm uses the metacpan api, but i feel package installer and listings are sep enough that zef/fez whatever should probably use its own json apis to install, though that said server side search is quite nice once the ecosystem gets large enough that giant json files are problamatic to download every time

[10:52] <JRaspass> our search is fairly crude atm, its just pg fts

[10:54] <patrickb> Fine for now I guess.

[10:54] <JRaspass> it does at least handle `foo bar` matching `foo::bar` which is more than modules.raku iirc

[10:56] <JRaspass> anyways tl;dr happy to support any new ecosystems, need to handle dists with overlapping auth so it should be no skin off our noses 

[11:01] <patrickb> Have to leave. o/
