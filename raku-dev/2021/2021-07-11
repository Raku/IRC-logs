[17:28] <melezhik> .

[17:30] <melezhik> hi rakudo devs, whateverable tarballs still not available

[17:31] <melezhik> ^^ AlexDaniel

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> hello

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> shareable6: HEAD

[17:31] <shareable6> AlexDaniel, https://whateverable.6lang.org/HEAD

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> what do you mean by that?

[17:32] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/4fca7b89e13bebf55a82e6bd1d4c3547

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> ahhaaa

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> that HEAD is a bit behind

[17:32] <melezhik> it started since yesterday

[17:32] <melezhik> not sure if it is only for head

[17:34] <melezhik> this is for another commit -  https://gist.github.com/melezhik/a213e14719afbcbce112aa180fd963ec

[17:36] <AlexDaniel> uh just for your info, I think you're assuming somewhere that whateverable has a build that you need

[17:36] <AlexDaniel> there's a slight delay always

[17:36] <AlexDaniel> but, yes, there's an issue currently

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> OK it started building the last commit

[17:40] <melezhik> thanks

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> will check again in a few minutes

[17:41] <melezhik> btw Alex, are you in charge of whateverable ? 

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> yes, still

[17:41] <melezhik> ok, this is good

[17:41] <melezhik> thanks for support

[17:43] <melezhik> releasable: status

[17:43] <releasable6> melezhik, Next release in â‰ˆ12 days and â‰ˆ1 hour. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[17:43] <releasable6> melezhik, Details: https://gist.github.com/9dfe821e4f73ca56030bf9741cb25896

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> there were plans to move it to raku infra but I'm too busy lately :(

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> it is clearly goig through commits currently

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> going*

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> shareable6: 265888ced3b31

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> Definitely trying to get attention ðŸ˜Œ

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> And it needs some, indeed

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> japhb: there was a case when bisectable was addressed three times, each time with a differently misspelled nickname, and then the user gave up. Since then all whateverable bots attempt to guess if they were addressed :)

[23:28] <moon-child> those who do not use tab completion deserve whatever they get :)

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> it worked perfectly when there were just a few bots, but with 20-ish there are some collisions

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> well ðŸ˜€

[23:29] <AlexDaniel> whateverables always try to dwym first

[23:29] <AlexDaniel> and if that doesn't work, ok maybe you do deserve it after all, yeah :D

[23:30] <AlexDaniel> tellable: thank you

[23:30] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, Anytime!

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> yeah, not adding 6 works, so the distance threshold should be bumped by 1 simply

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> OR maybe they should also strdistance for other bot names and compare who has the smallest distanceâ€¦

[23:32] <moon-child> I think the latter is a better idea

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> anyway, good night!

[23:33] <moon-child> night
