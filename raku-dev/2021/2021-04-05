[09:05] <nine> In the meantime I'll find out the differences between nativecall, nativecallinvoke and nativeinvoke

[09:26] <bartolin_> oh, ++nine

[09:30] <bartolin_> nine: https://github.com/usev6/rakudo/commit/ad264f4b90f3ff7de38ebb8f6809ef2d09bcd07a has the workarounds that I was mumbling about in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4277#issuecomment-812060052

[09:32] <bartolin_> together with https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/708 this makes more than half of the test files from 04-nativecall pass. A lot of the remaining problems seem to be caused by the NullPointerException I mentioned -- which could very well be a totally different problem

[09:35] <nine> Ah, yes. https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/1b0950e3e99d15dce6fc004a05581fe8e155c080 would need porting to JVM. That's the unbox_i($!call).

[09:35] <nine> Where does the NPE happen with the get_int implemented?

[09:37] <bartolin_> Unfortunately I wasn't able to find the exact place :( But I've stumbled upon this old issue that might be related: https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/3713

[09:39] <bartolin_> https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/3713#issuecomment-570866667

[09:40] <nine> I think the full implementation would be just:

[09:40] <nine>     @Override

[09:40] <nine>     public long get_int(ThreadContext tc) {

[09:40] <nine>         return body.entry_point == null ? 0 : 1;

[09:51] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0b91b21afa

[09:52] <nine> bartolin_: the irony about the whole backtrace affair is that the JVM has been right all along, yet the test has been fudged for the JVM and the MoarVM bug made into spec.

[09:55] <bartolin_> nine: yeah, I've read that (either in one of your commit messages or while backlogging IRC). I'm pretty sure that I've fudged the tests for the JVM once they started to fail :/

[09:56] *** Kaiepi left
[09:56] *** Kaiepi joined
[10:01] <bartolin_> it happens from time to time that tests start to fail on the JVM backend. Usually I try to find out what causes the breakage, but often I don't have enough time to investigate closely. In that cases I tend to fudge the tests, so that new spectest failures are easy to see -- and for "looking at the problem later".

[10:11] <bartolin_> Probably that is not good enough. Maybe I should try to take the time and create issues for such regressions on the JVM backend -- because regressions there could point to a bug that doesn't surface on MoarVM (or to backend-specific code).

[12:18] <bartolin_> nine: I made some progress with the NullPointerException. It seems to stem from https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/cb55e25345/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/raku/nqp/runtime/Ops.java#L2636 because tc.native_j is null. Interestingly there is a check for this in the very simliar code at https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/cb55e25345/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/raku/nqp/runtime/Ops.java#L2575. That check was introduced with https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/720d05222b ..

[12:27] <nine> bartolin_: don't we have a VMNull object on the JVM as well?

[12:30] <nine> Oh, but tc.native_j is not a place for storing SixModelObjects but explicitly for any Java object. So maybe a null is indeed ok there

[12:33] <bartolin_> yeah, I think null seems to be okay there. (otherwise there would be a VMNull available). Anyway it feels like I make more progress
