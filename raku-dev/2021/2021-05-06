[09:30] <Xliff> \o

[09:31] <Xliff> Can someone look into R4356?

[09:31] <Xliff> Or tell me how to track number of files Rakudo has open?

[09:32] <Xliff> Is there a way this can be done with --profile or would --tracing be better?

[09:39] <MasterDuke> or maybe something like `strace -e open,close -o files.log` and counting them in the log file?

[09:40] <MasterDuke> --profile won't do it, --tracing might help. i'm not sure, but timotimo would know better

[09:52] <Xliff> MasterDuke: What would you suggest I do (except golf... this one is too complex, I think) to get 4356 looked at?

[09:54] <Xliff> I'm creating a docker image that (I hope) will have everything ready exept for the final step.

[09:58] <timotimo> i'm not sure what exactly you mean by --tracing

[09:58] <tellable6> 2021-05-04T00:07:03Z #raku <japhb> timotimo Can you merge https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/73 ?

[09:59] <timotimo> i would probably recommend gdb-ing into the process, breakpointing everything that creates files and everything that closes file descriptors, and grabbing a backtrace for each

[10:02] <Xliff> timotimo: That's a lot of work for a bug report.

[10:02] <timotimo> aye, a gdb script could / should be written for this task in particular

[10:03] <Xliff> timotimo: I have no expertise in writing such a thing.

[10:03] <timotimo> if/when we get tracy integrated with getting stack info for perl6-level frames, that could be very good

[10:03] <Xliff> timotimo: Could you comment on 4356, then?

[10:03] <timotimo> i'm not sure if that's actually a thing, but i was thinking just a little piece of text you could just copypaste into the gdb console

[10:03] <timotimo> M#4356

[10:03] <Xliff> At the very least I can say someone has at least commented on it.

[10:04] <timotimo> oh it's an R anyway

[10:04] <Xliff> If you have something to paste into gdb console, I can do.

[10:20] <timotimo> i don't, it'd be a bit of searching and dayjob got me in its clutches at the mo

[14:11] <Xliff> timotimo: OK, thanks. If you can tell me the broad strokes, maybe I can write it?

[14:22] <timotimo> ok, so first you'd search for anything that opens files; in your case i guess it'd be enough to find those that are actually used in the workload

[14:22] <timotimo> those places you'd want to put a breakpoint on

[14:23] <timotimo> you can use "commands <breakpoint number>" to put some gdb commands in that should run when the breakpoint is hit; i hope you can put more than one breakpoint number in there

[14:23] <Xliff> Um. This is occurring in precomp though.

[14:23] <Xliff> So I'd be doing this against the rakudo source?

[14:23] <timotimo> the commands would be like a bunch of "up" so a "tc" comes in scope, then "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)"

[14:24] <Xliff> Or MoarVM?

[14:24] <Xliff> I'm thinking MoarVM

[14:24] <timotimo> well, you can really only gdb C code or similar, so you'll target the source code of moarvm to find places that open stuff, but you'd be running moarvm with the arguments that reproduce your workload

[14:24] <Xliff> Even though the problem is in the Rakudo compiler.

[14:26] <timotimo> have you been able to freeze the execution at the point the explosion happens?

[14:26] <Xliff> Never.

[14:26] <Xliff> It's already changed once.

[14:26] <timotimo> at that point you could check `ls -lsa /proc/<pid of moarvm process>/fds/` or fdinfo or so to see if these fds point at anything suspicious

[14:27] <timotimo> because on unix "everything is a file" we have more file descriptors than actual files on disk that we open

[14:27] <Xliff> Good suggestion!

[14:27] <timotimo> for example, every thread can get a uv eventloop, which also grabs at least one file descriptor for polling purposes

[15:09] <Xliff> OK. Found another bug while in a docker environment

[15:10] <Xliff> "No such method 'absolute' for invocant of type 'Slip'"

[15:10] <Xliff> ^ This while in a docker container. If I do the same command from outside the container, it doesn't show.

[15:10] <Xliff> So I suppose the bug could be environmental.

[15:10] <Xliff> This is not the first time I've encountered it.

[15:17] <tonyo> ahh i mean what is the csv file those things are actually parsing.  i looked in your repo, did i miss it?

[15:17] <[Tux]> that is the file hello.csv as described on speed.html. Simple as that

[15:18] <[Tux]> in the repo it is described in README.speed

[15:41] <Xliff> Which contains the correct arch.

[15:42] <lizmat> yeah

[15:42] <Xliff> lizmat: Jinx! :)

[15:42] <Xliff> Should it be `uname -m`?

[15:42] <Xliff> What's the best way to test to see if you are running in a Docker image?

[15:42] <lizmat> jmerelo might know

[15:44] <tonyo> Xliff: ls /.dockerenv 

[15:44] <tonyo> does that file exist in your image?

[15:45] <Xliff> Yyp

[15:45] <tonyo> ideally you'd set an env var.

[15:45] <Xliff> Yup, even

[15:46] <tonyo> if that file exists or if there's a docker user in proc/user/cgroup?  i think that's the path

[15:46] <tonyo> i'd set an environment variable though.

[15:46] <tonyo> s/group/user

[19:16] <sena_kun> lizmat, well, yes.

[19:17] <sena_kun> anyway, quite a lot of packages are broken on Windows due to this bug, so IMO it would be nice to fix it and unbreak lots of code at once

[19:17] <lizmat> ah, indeed... 

[19:17] <lizmat> but maybe that's just  how WIndows works with directories ?

[19:17] <lizmat> re encoding and such ?

[19:19] <sena_kun> lizmat, dunno, it feels like the resolving of a `..` in a path is bogus on Windows in some edge case (related to this diacritic combiner, apparently) while it works fine on gnu/linux

[19:19] <lizmat> yeah, that feels about right :-(

[23:32] <Xliff> Yes. That way all of the p6-GLib stuff is precompiled.

[23:32] <Xliff> Better than downloading all of the repos and compiling them by hand... :/

[23:34] <tonyo> you should change your ulimit and give that precomp a shot

[23:36] <Xliff> tonyo++: Doing that right now. Thanks!

[23:40] <tonyo> doesn't mean it's not leaking handles but it does help golf that down to a small repo and setting a low ulimit

[23:41] <[Coke]> (did you mean coke?) huh?

[23:57] <Xliff> tonyo: That's hopeful given the amount of code that I have. It might not be possible to get a small golf.
