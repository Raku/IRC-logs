[12:20] * leont is slightly shocked raku has taken over pl2bat logic. That stuff is nasty.

[12:20] <lizmat> que?

[12:21] <lizmat> ah, surely must have been an inspiration :-(

[12:22] <leont> Surely, the bit that serves only for Win9x/dos support didn't need to be copied along.

[12:24] <lizmat> PRs welcome  :)

[12:25] <leont> Will do, later
