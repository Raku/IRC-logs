[13:06] <MasterDuke> ok, all three PRs merged

[13:37] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: do you mind doing a blin run to see if those PRs caused any new problems?

[13:38] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, I think the available option now is to cast vrurg

[13:39] <MasterDuke> ok, thanks

[13:41] *** klapperl joined
[13:41] <vrurg> MasterDuke: I'll do it.

[13:43] <MasterDuke> thanks

[13:43] <vrurg> sena_kun: still to be done on ugexe-patch-1 branch?

[13:43] <sena_kun> vrurg, yes. I think it's time to just merge it, by the way

[13:44] <vrurg> sena_kun: it's up to you, I just run it. :)

[13:44] <sena_kun> vrurg, yup. Sorry to burden you with this, I lost my ryzen machine some time ago. :S

[13:46] <vrurg> sena_kun: no prob. That's why I bought this workstation a while ago - to help with development.

[13:47] <vrurg> sena_kun: BTW, do you have any tricks for tests which pop-up windows? Like a gaming one.

[13:47] <sena_kun> vrurg, I know about this one, but no tricks. I mean, the best bet is to patch the module to not do this, but the author is not available IIRC.

[13:49] <vrurg> Ok. Perhaps we shall consider excluding modules from blin testing if an author doesn't respond to a PR for 3-6 months.

[13:51] <sena_kun> vrurg, I think the motivation is "they are still used as SOME code to test rakudo with, even if the code is bogus, any differences in behavior between releases spotted can be regressions".

[13:53] <vrurg> sena_kun: Most of the time – yes. Perhaps, if the rule is considered, it must not be a mandatory regulation but just give the right to do so if necessary.

[13:55] <sena_kun> vrurg, yes, some modules are excluded from testing, so we can add https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Games-BubbleBreaker/issues/9 to the exclused list.

[13:59] <vrurg> sena_kun: Perhaps, it worth considering. It just crossed my mind that I can actually start doing nightly blin runs. But if the module just silently bypasses if there is no DISPLAY then it's no problem.

[14:00] <sena_kun> vrurg, the idea is cool, but IMO the development tempo does not require nightly.

[14:02] <vrurg> sena_kun: I agree, but it might be helpful on occasion. I would only need your help to setup sharing of the results. I guess blin can auto-create a gist, can't it?

[14:04] <sena_kun> vrurg, it can't, but it can be automated I believe. Once I get a better machine I'll take a look into it.

[14:10] <vrurg> Wow, Pastebin::Gist! That's all I need. 

[14:11] <vrurg> MasterDuke: BTW, it already runs. Can't promise I'll be able to post it ASAP though.

[14:12] <MasterDuke> well, hopefully there will be nothing to post...

[15:03] <jdv79> MasterDuke: thanks for doing the time thing.  i wanted to do something like that a few months ago but other things...

[15:04] <MasterDuke> sure, turned out to not be too bad

[15:08] <MasterDuke> i guess after the release it's time to submit PRs to the ecosystem modules to change `nqp::time_n` to `now`

[15:11] <b2gills> Speaking of which, did that change break tests? t/02-rakudo/03-corekeys-6[cde].t t/02-rakudo/04-settingkeys-6[ce].t

[15:12] <b2gills> I just ran my build bash script, and those tests prevented it from installing (a simple cd to the build directory and make install worked)

[15:16] <MasterDuke> oh. whoops

[15:17] <b2gills> FYI. I wrote my own build script so that it would purposefully be more fragile, for the sheer fact that it is different to everybody else.

[15:18] <b2gills> That way I catch things that others might not catch

[15:19] <MasterDuke> looks like i ran a spectest after my last change, but not a test

[15:23] <b2gills> I just thought of something cool I could add to my build script.

[15:23] <b2gills> It keeps track of the previous commit, so I could potentially make it generate a GitHub link to the diff. Which would help with such debugging.

[15:27] <MasterDuke> i just directly pushed a fix to the tests

[17:25] <patrickb> btw. any reason sena-kun shouldn't get admin access to the rakudo project? To me it feels he is one of the suspects that should have access.

[17:26] <sena_kun> patrickb, the lower number of people the better? :)

[17:28] <patrickb> On the one hand less people having access reduces chances of misuse and accidental breakage, but on the other hand also helps with the bus factor.

[17:30] <patrickb> I also think one should have a look from time to time to make sure no people long gone from the project are in the admin list.

[17:40] <lizmat> looks like masak and pmichaud are still admins

[17:40] <lizmat> and moritz, jnthn and me

[17:56] <lizmat> because you're still around most of the time

[17:56] <lizmat> masak and pmichaud are not

[17:59] <moritz_> yes, but I'm not actively admining, so there's no reason for me to keep the privs
