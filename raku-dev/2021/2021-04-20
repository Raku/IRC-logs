[13:13] <Kaiepi> i have some legal concerns about the work i've been doing on network addresses and dns resolvers

[13:15] <Kaiepi> i use modified snippets of openbsd source code in a few spots. i know there are comments i need to worry about in doing so, but is this permissible, and if so, is there anything else i need to worry about?

[13:18] <sena_kun> Kaiepi, you might ping codesections in #raku

[13:18] <MasterDuke> my advice would be to purchase a new name and identity, move to someplace like Macau, and preemptively put out a hit on Theo de Raadt. but IANAL...

[15:24] <MasterDuke> anybody here on windows ever see this when running rakudo's tests? https://dev.azure.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/_build/results?buildId=454&view=logs&j=5b519533-8a6a-5ec0-9930-bcff75bff664&t=6c4f881f-c031-5fa2-35de-9b22b606ed7e&l=1900

[15:33] <MasterDuke> the error is: Failed to rename 'D:\a\1\rakudo\t\04-nativecall\.precomp\3350F24AD6CA381ED1FFF13D57FAE45D527E2FB4\64\640AB2BAE07BEDC4C163F679A746F7AB7FB5D1FA.repo-id.tmp' to 'D:\a\1\rakudo\t\04-nativecall\.precomp\3350F24AD6CA381ED1FFF13D57FAE45D527E2FB4\64\640AB2BAE07BEDC4C163F679A746F7AB7FB5D1FA.repo-id': Failed to rename file: operation not

[15:37] <MasterDuke> this is after i added `-j2` to the prove command

[15:38] <ugexe> then its probably because one process is holding a file open while another is e.g. trying to close it

[15:38] <ugexe> er, or renaming a file that another process has a handle open on

[15:39] *** softmoth_ joined
[15:39] <MasterDuke> yeah, is `-jn` just not safe on windows?

[15:41] <patrickbkr[m]> MasterDuke: I have only ever used -j for the MoarVM build on Windows.

[15:42] <patrickbkr[m]> -j0 was probably faithfully copied from some older CI system I looked at when creating the Azure config...

[15:42] <MasterDuke> so you haven't tried it with prove?

[15:43] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1475/commits/7c3976207813b414550597fac1b3032269785e60 looks like it took 10m off the total runtime, so i'd like to keep as much of it as possible

[15:43] <ugexe> well technically it seems that multi process on windows where each process uses some of the same modules isn't safe

[15:44] <MasterDuke> huh, how has that not cropped up before?

[15:45] <ugexe> it pops up fairly often. nine has fixed it a couple of times, but apparently some gremlins still lurk

[15:45] <ugexe> windows file system time granularity and how lock file work on windows are the two things (i think) that make the whole thing work poorly on windows

[15:46] <ugexe> well, not poorly. less than perfectly

[15:50] <raydiak> windows antivirus can cause this according to https://github.com/valery-barysok/session-file-store/issues/69#issuecomment-671281388. try disabling it? the comment at the end of that same discussion suggests a permanent fix, if that's the issue

[15:50] <MasterDuke> hm, leave the PR as is in the hope it forces someone (probably nine or you) to fix? or remove the `-j2` from prove on windows (even though that's where the biggest speedup was)?

[15:51] <MasterDuke> raydiak: ooh, interesting...

[15:52] <ugexe> personally (and im probably in the minority) i like to run my CI tests with just one job so its as reproducable as possible

[15:52] <ugexe> well the way windows antivirus would cause the issue is the same way two raku processes trying to precompile would cause it

[15:52] <ugexe> windows antivirus is just another thing that might have the handle open

[15:54] <MasterDuke> heh, i guess both would be good. reproducibility with the single job pipeline, more chaos with the multiple job pipeline

[19:36] * [Coke] apparently needs to do more than skim those commits to understand them :)

[19:38] <nwc10> mine?

[19:40] <nwc10> apologise for using rude words, but:

[19:40] <nwc10>   perl -e 'printf "%s: %a\n", $_, $_ for map { 10 ** $_ } 0 .. 30'

[19:40] <nwc10> and there is no pattern in the bit patterns in the mantissas of the powers of 10s

[19:41] <nwc10> (and also ** is not trustworthy everywhere - that's the zeroeth problem)

[19:41] <nwc10> enough to mean that nqp::pow_n(10.0, $exp) isn't quite correct everywhere for all integer values of $exp

[19:41] <nwc10> and this messes up some sprintf formats

[19:42] <nwc10> I don't propose to add %a to the current sprintf implementation.

[19:42] <lizmat> %a would be ?

[19:42] <nwc10> but once lizmat's new one has landed, I'll try to remember to figure it out

[19:42] <nwc10> floating point in hex notation

[19:42] <lizmat> ah

[19:42] <nwc10> turns out that it's useful for debugging

[19:43] <nwc10> (And I guess also efficient round tripping to strings)

[19:43] <nwc10> no normal program needs it
