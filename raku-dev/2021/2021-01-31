[09:21] <MasterDuke> https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_ci_integration_bot i just found out about this from the facebook group, didn't see any mention here before?

[10:01] <moritz> it's been mentioned on twitter

[10:31] <lizmat> and on /r/rakulang

[10:31] <lizmat> and in the next RWN

[10:33] <nwc10> but the next RWN does not exist yet. How can you know this? :-)

[10:33] <lizmat> that is for you to guess and for me to know  :-)

[21:41] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Thanks for your comment on my grant application. I think the best place to discuss comment triggers and other aspects of the planned CI infrastructure is the respective problem-solving PR: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/pull/219

[22:15] <patrickb> MasterDuke: WRT supporting other platforms as CI targets. The architecture I have in mind provides a clean abstraction of the CI backends, so adding others is trivial (Well, as complex as the CI is.) E.g. The SourceHut CI provides OpenBSD and FreeBSD workers. I would like to limit the scope of the PR though, to fix our biggest problems first and actually finish that. Then we can build on that. 

[22:16] <patrickb> For bystanders: This is a reply to the second comment of https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_raku_ci_integration_bot 

[22:17] <patrickb> I'm not sure where to reply best. I'll probably put the above in a comment as well, but not today.
