[11:53] <tbrowder> hi, why does list have .first but no .last?

[11:53] <tbrowder> it has begin/end head/tail

[11:54] <tbrowder> symmetry is lta

[11:54] <tbrowder> and it's confusing

[11:57] <tbrowder> sorry, no begin

[11:58] <tbrowder> so why no begin either?

[12:01] <lizmat> tbrowder: because "last" already exists as a sub

[12:01] <lizmat> so it would be confusing

[12:02] <lizmat> you can add the :end adverb to .first

[12:02] <lizmat> m: dd ^10 .first(Int, :end)

[12:02] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «9␤»

[12:02] <lizmat> list has begin ?

[12:04] <tbrowder> forgot about last, sorry (but i did search in docs but must have missed seeing it). didn't know about :end, thnx. i guess i'll just have to say head/tail 100 times ;-D

[12:04] *** MasterDuke joined
[12:05] <lizmat> dd ^10 .first(:end)

[12:05] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «9␤»

[12:05] <lizmat> I guess that's the equivalent of tail

[12:05] <lizmat> also note that you can specify a number with head/tail

[12:05] <lizmat> m: ^10 .tail(5)

[12:05] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «»

[12:05] <lizmat> m: dd ^10 .tail(5)

[12:05] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «(5, 6, 7, 8, 9).Seq␤»

[12:05] <lizmat> m: dd ^10 .head(5)

[12:05] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «(0, 1, 2, 3, 4).Seq␤»

[12:06] <lizmat> you can't with .first
