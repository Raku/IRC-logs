[03:16] <japhb> lizmat, raydiak: CBOR::Simple 0.0.3 is out; I've made the suggested enum changes and captured some of the low-hanging optimization fruit.  (It's around twice as fast as 0.0.2, but that still leaves it ~4x as slow as JSON::Fast right now.  More to do clearly.  :-)  )

[11:17] <lizmat> sena_kun: re release, there may be some bad news test-t wise :-(

[11:17] <lizmat> looks like a recent MoarVM change made test-t about 10% slower again  :-(

[11:18] <sena_kun> lizmat, the one fixing inlining?

[11:18] <lizmat> could well be

[11:18] <sena_kun> "test-t              1.949 -  2.066"

[11:18] <sena_kun> ^ you mean this?

[11:19] <lizmat> [08:41:58]  <[Tux]>	test-t              2.149 -  2.256

[11:19] <sena_kun> hmm

[11:20] <sena_kun> on 21 it was ok, but 22 is "bad"

[11:20] <lizmat> yeah  :-(

[11:20] <sena_kun> to be honest I don't think we have more time to investigate that.

[11:20] <lizmat> yeah, I agree

[11:21] <lizmat> expecially with all the recent activity on MoarVM

[11:21] <lizmat> by all involved!

[11:22] <lizmat> it doesn't appear to affect stability, *that* would be a blocker to me

[11:22] <lizmat> in related news: I seem not to be able to get IRC::Client::Plugin::Logger to pass its tests on the most recent MacOS

[11:22] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client-Plugin-Logger/actions/runs/777523449

[11:23] <sena_kun> lizmat, thanks for noting. Is it a regression?

[11:23] <lizmat> I'm not sure: it's the first time I've done anything with IRC::Client

[11:23] <lizmat> and it runs fine on my MacOS

[11:23] <lizmat> but that's not a recent one, for various reasons

[11:30] <lizmat> is there a way to detect a segfault with a Proc::Async ?

[11:47] <timotimo> exit codes have the signal encoded in them, though the return code you get with the obvious method gives that part of the value masked out i think?

[11:48] <timotimo> https://docs.raku.org/type/Proc#method_signal

[11:56] <lizmat> signal 6

[11:57] <lizmat> SIGABRT ?

[11:58] <lizmat> "It essentially means your app has crashed"

[11:59] <lizmat> sadly STDOUT nor STDERR report anything :-(

[16:59] <timotimo> lizmat: sigabrt tends to happen when a program calls the c standard library function `abort()`, which is also often the consequence of an `assert(blah)` failing, but in that case there is usually an error message to go with it to say which assertion failed to cause the abort

[17:03] <lizmat> well, no message whatsoever :-(

[17:06] *** epony joined
[17:10] <timotimo> you're on macos in this case?

[17:12] <lizmat> that's the one failing yes, but locally on MacOS all is fine

[17:13] <lizmat> but I'm at least one major version behind locally

[17:13] <lizmat> 10.15.7 on GH Actions

[17:13] <lizmat> locally 10.14.6

[17:16] <lizmat> so I wonder if it is a more generic issue on newer MacOS

[17:16] <lizmat> cause the module in question doesn't do anything strange

[17:16] <lizmat> so I suspect IRC::Client is failing

[17:16] <lizmat> I'm considering adopting IRC::Client fwiw

[17:17] <timotimo> i don't know how you get a macos to generate a core dump, but having that available would probably be insightful

[17:18] *** softmoth_ joined
[17:19] <tonyo> is irc client a c binding?

[17:37] <[Coke]> tonyo: I don't think directly, but perhaps IO::Socket::Async::SSL is?

[17:37] <[Coke]> (yes, that has NativeCall)

[17:42] <tonyo> that was causing a lot of issues for me on big sur as well, that's a good candidate to investigate

[17:43] <lizmat> yeah, sadly I'm stuck at Mojave for now, has Apple has decided to destroy all of my video / music workflows on higher versions

[17:43] <lizmat> without viable upgrade path

[17:44] <[Coke]> sounds like you found out before it was too late, so that's something.

[17:44] <lizmat> gave up on converting iPhoto lib after it had been busy for a week

[17:44] <lizmat> [Coke] sadly, I didn't

[17:44] <[Coke]> I barely use this mac and I'm afraid to upgrade.

[17:44] <[Coke]> lizmat: oh noes.

[17:44] <lizmat> yeah, that's another few weeks of my life gone repairing my music workflow after nuking my media iMac back to Mojave

[17:53] *** softmoth_ left
[18:32] <tonyo> i've bricked two macs, one was a work computer doing the upgrade

[18:35] <lizmat> bricked as in: unsalvagable hardware wise ?

[18:49] <tonyo> one yea, one took about six days to recover (luckily my personal)

[18:57] *** vrurg left
[19:13] <tonyo> not entirely sure.  i think the company i work for had some jamf stuff on it for machine management and they were trying to prevent the upgrade and we were in the middle of troubleshooting vpn stuff, the mac froze, rebooted, actually upgraded and then could never boot

[19:14] <lizmat> ah... ok, so not your typical user setup

[19:16] <lizmat> timotimo: changed the GH action to just do a "raku -Ilib t/01-basic.rakutest"

[19:16] <lizmat> and the output is:

[19:16] <lizmat> line 1:  1380 Abort trap: 6           raku -Ilib t/01-basic.rakutest

[19:30] <timotimo> well that sounds pretty broken

[19:31] <lizmat> yeah...  :-(

[19:33] <timotimo> there must be some way to run it with a debugger and have it automatically spit out backtraces and such

[19:33] <timotimo> but me no macos person

[19:33] <timotimo> there'd probably be lldb on there, the clang debugger?

[19:34] <tonyo> you usually only run into tool issues like that for stuff that's in gnu and not bsd ^

[19:34] <tonyo> lldb iirc, strace, etc all there

[19:35] <timotimo> strace could already be slightly interesting, but will probably not have enough details to figure out where the problem is happening

[19:39] <lizmat> note: this is not happening globally, only when running in Github Actions

[19:40] <lizmat> so interaction is rather difficult, and I have no idea what tools there are during testing

[19:44] <lizmat> afk&
