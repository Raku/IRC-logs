[14:43] <Xliff> Hi! If I want to add my own custom messages to the Rakudo module install process, where would I do that?

[15:31] <lizmat> ugexe nine might know

[15:31] <lizmat> nine is on holiday, though

[15:39] <Xliff> Thanks, lizmat. I'll ask again, later.

[18:47] <timo> with the ability to add to the "junction fallback" mechanism, i.e. a third branch off of Mu that lets you provide your very own autothreader, this should be implementable, but it'd steal `...` for that. could use something else, of course.

[19:09] <timo> oh, except we'd need custom parsing to make the `foo.bar + ...` form invoke bar on everything in foo
