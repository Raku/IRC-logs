[07:27] <tyil> the Rakudo 2021.02.1 release has no assets on github like the previous releases, is this intentional?

[08:20] *** Geth joined
[08:20] <tyil> it seems to be happening more often lately :/

[08:21] <nine> So what's wrong with Geth?

[09:07] <tyil> nine: nobody knows

[09:07] <tyil> .tell sena_kun thanks!

[09:07] <tellable6> tyil, I'll pass your message to sena_kun

[09:09] *** sena_kun joined
[09:10] <nine> does it crash? or just hang?

[09:11] <tyil> the raku process is still alive, but it seems to disconnect often and not reconnect

[09:11] <nine> anything in any logs?

[09:12] <tyil> actually, thinking about it, wonder if it's just not responding to a PING when handling a github request

[09:12] <MasterDuke> tried running it under strace?

[09:12] <tyil> MasterDuke: I wouldn't have a clue of what info to get out of the strace output to be frank

[09:14] *** leont joined
[09:15] <MasterDuke> i haven't used strace much for networking problems, but you would be able to see failed system calls

[09:15] <MasterDuke> sends/receives, etc

[09:35] <gfldex> is nqp::getlexcaller exposed somehow in Raku-land?

[09:38] <MasterDuke> pretty sure not

[09:47] <nine> tyil: I'd do two things: go over all react blocks and Supply things and ensure that we don't swallow any exceptions and add lots of debug output for connection open/close, etc.

[09:48] <nine> Though a quick look at the source shows that it should already report exceptions on STDOUT, so they should be visible in the journal
