[18:24] * lizmat hopes her local module installation clusterf*ck is not an indication of problems with the 2021.09 release

[18:41] <lizmat> it appears that nuking ~/.zef fixed it

[18:44] <lizmat> or maybe not  :-(

[18:51] <lizmat> wonders what else she need to nuke to get OO::Monitors to work  :-(

[18:51] <lizmat> [String::Color] Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp' (from 'site#sources/45334C557865A97D1ECA0D3F3A3FAF2017FCE553 (OO::Monitors)')

[18:59] <lizmat> argh, looks like any module depending on OO::Monitors fails to install atm  (at least for me)

[19:13] <timo> man, if only we had a simpler way to have both a rakudo for new-disp:new-disp:new-disp and another rakudo for master:master:master

[19:16] <ugexe> dunno if it works with commit shas or branches but `rakubrew triple x y z`

[19:18] <ugexe> otherwise there would be some combo of options to pass those through to the various Configure.pl

[19:18] <ugexe> --configure-opts=--nqp-opts=... or something

[19:35] <timo> i haven't used rakudobrew in 1000 years :D
