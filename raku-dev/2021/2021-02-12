[00:35] <japhb> Does react {} make any guarantees about (lack of) starvation across the whenever blocks?  If so, what exactly is guaranteed?

[00:36] <japhb> Reason: I'm looking at a rearchitecture of the internals of a server I've been working on, and I'm trying to avoid a noisy client from starving other clients on input, or a spammy client (attempting to message all other clients continuously, for instance) being able to starve other server activity on output

[00:39] <japhb> Slightly more subtle but same problem is if a small number of clients can work together to starve all others (as might happen even if react doesn't drain a single whenever source dry before going to the next, if there is no guarantee to visit *all* whenever sources that have data before returning to a previous active source)

[00:40] <japhb> And if there is no intrinsic guarantee now, 1) Is it planned for the future?  2) What's the recommended workaround?

[02:07] <ugexe> i cant answer that, but it sparked me to try using a bunch of whenevers and the following doesn't fire the second whenevers (but will if s/100000/10000/ on my system)

[02:07] <ugexe> react { for ^100000 { whenever Supply.interval(60) { }; }; say "done registering initial whenevers"; whenever Supply.interval(1) { say $_ } }

[02:09] <ugexe> not sure why anyone would do such a thing of course

[21:10] <japhb> jnthn: Did you design react to avoid starvation of whenevers under heavy load?  See question from last night ^^

[21:10] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to jnthn
