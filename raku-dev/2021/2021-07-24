[09:22] <MasterDuke> how does one override operators in newer language version?

[09:27] <MasterDuke> if i just put a file in src/core.e/ and add it to tools/templates/6.e/core_sources it compiles, but then running with `use v6.e.PREVIEW;` gives `Ambiguous call to 'infix:<~&>(Str, Str)'; these signatures all match: <...>`

[09:33] <lizmat> I've used a hack in those case, not sure that would be advisable

[09:33] <lizmat> basically:

[09:33] <lizmat> BEGIN my &old-foo = &foo;

[09:33] <lizmat> or rather:

[09:33] <lizmat> BEGIN my &old-foo = &infix:<foo>;

[09:33] <lizmat> proto &infix:<foo>() { }

[09:34] <lizmat> multi sub infix:<foo>( )  {  # replacement candidate }

[09:34] <lizmat> multi sub infix:<foo>(|c) { &old-foo(|c) }    # use old versions otherwise

[13:30] <Altai-man> patrickb, I did a moarvm release some time ago, are you interested in it? wrt rakudo: I am now (very slowly) running stresstests on errata branches.

[13:31] <Altai-man> patrickb, I am not sure about the process, how do you want me to share it with you?

[13:32] <patrickb> Dunno. Is there much console action going on? If yes, a shared session (ssh + tmux or similar) would be good.
