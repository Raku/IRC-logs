[10:33] <sena_kun> nine, can re-revert if you see the commit to be helpful

[10:36] <nine> Well it should give better performance. It also seems to uncover quite a few spesh bugs due to unlocking more optimizations :)

[10:36] <nine> We reverted for the last release but then didn't revert the revert. Until we do we won't be able to fix the actual issues.

[10:39] <nine> Well, let's put those 5 days to use and if we can't fix the actual issues we can always revert the revert of the revert...
