[11:40] <codesections> (I think "up to 2× as fast" is underselling the perf gains from ^^^^.  I just benchmarked a sort based on the SO question, and saw a 4× speedup)

[12:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[12:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Specifically allomorph cmp, Pair cmp and Complex cmp.  This should

[12:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: be quite visible when sorting allomorphs, Pairs or Complex numbers.

[12:48] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d61d9836ae

[12:49] <lizmat> this should be possible for more cases where cmp is called, but then we have a chicken-egg problem

[12:49] <lizmat> in order to be able to check for Order::Same and friends, the code in the setting needs to be *after* the Order enum code

[12:49] <codesections> hmmm 70a8e3661f seems to break sorting with custom comparators that don't return an Order. 

[12:49] <lizmat> but the Order enum code cannot exists without the Enumeration role

[12:49] <lizmat> codesections 

[12:50] <codesections> c: 70a8e3661f say (^10).sort({$^a > $^b ?? True !! False}); say (^10).sort({$^a > $^b ?? Order::More !! Order::Less});

[12:50] <lizmat> well... then they're naughty, as comparators are supposed to return an Order

[12:50] <codesections> True.  But I bet a lot out there don't (it's not enforced)

[12:50] <lizmat> yeah, probably  :-(

[12:53] <lizmat> sena_kun: could you do a Blin run to check for any module testing fallout? wrt https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/70a8e3661f

[12:57] <codesections> it also seems like not returning an Order is something we might want to support, though?  Eg <D E F a b c>.sort({$^a.fc gt $^b.fc})

[12:58] <lizmat> don't know...  I mean... https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/70a8e3661f didn't break any spectests

[12:58] <codesections> that seems pretty clear from a dwim perspective, and works on current release

[12:58] <codesections> true

[13:20] <codesections> Looking at Roast, I _think_ the intent is for Bools to work.  See https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S32-list/sort.t#L248

[13:23] <lizmat> yeah, testing some changes  :-)

[13:34] <lizmat> it will only take the Order checking path if the Callable indicates returning an Order:D in the signature

[13:35] <lizmat> otherwise it will take the candidate that coerces to Int (now without first coercing to Bool)

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Take a little bit of different approach on sorting comparators

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Instead of checking for Inty return values of the comparator, and

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Order return values, just check for Order values being returned by

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the comparator, and make that take the fast nqp::eqaddr path.

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[13:42] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Otherwise, use the old generic code path, but instead implicitely

[13:49] <lizmat> codesections: ^^ I think that addresses your points :-)

[13:51] <codesections> thanks, lizmat++  If I'm reading that correctly, only subs with a `--> Order:D` _constraint_ take the ...LIST-WITH-enum path, right?

[13:51] <lizmat> yup

[13:51] <codesections> m: sub returns-order() { Order::Less }; say &returns-order.returns

[13:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[13:52] <lizmat> m: sub returns-order(--> Order:D) { Order::Less }; say &returns-order.returns

[13:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «(Order:D)␤»

[13:53] <codesections> right.  So a lot of inline fns will probably take the ...WITH-int path.  Which is fine, just a bit slower

[13:53] <lizmat> yeah...  now to make sure all of the builtins have the correct return sig  :-)

[13:54] <codesections> (inline fns that actually do return an Order, I mean)

[13:55] <codesections> haha, yeah.  But this is good -- we're getting to the point where types are speeding things up, not just adding a runtime cost.  Which has always been the goal
