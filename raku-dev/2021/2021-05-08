[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: [JVM] Deserialize native arrays as such

[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: 

[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: There is a long standing issue with Rakudo on the JVM backend:

[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: If one declares a native array (like 'my int @arr;') this comes

[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: out as a non-native array after precompilation.

[10:51] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: (Compare https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1666.)

[10:57] <bartolin_> there we go. I'm curious if this really fixes all the problems with native arrays ;). I mean, spectest looked good, but I didn't try to remove the workarounds in Rakudo's code. I'll go and try that later.
