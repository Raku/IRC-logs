[16:22] <Xliff> \o

[16:22] <Xliff> if you have a proto sub, can it perform operations before calling candidates?

[16:23] <Xliff> If so, how? I've tried using '*' and 'nextsame' but they don't work.

[16:27] <ugexe> m: proto sub foo(|) { say 42; {*}; say 420; }; multi sub foo($a) { say $a }; foo(666)

[16:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «42␤666␤420␤»

[16:39] <Xliff> So it's "{*} and not just *"

[16:39] <Xliff> heh

[16:39] <Xliff> *headdesk*

[16:44] <[Coke]> Aye. I imagine it would be confused with a Whatevercode otherwise.

[20:04] <Xliff> Um. Isn't that a bit LTA?

[20:05] <Xliff> "{*}"  works, but "{ * }" doesn't?

[20:07] <MasterDuke58> {*} is a special thing, but yeah, a bit LTA

[20:48] <Xliff> Would be nice to make that \s insensitive, y'know?

[20:49] *** dogbert2 left
[20:50] <MasterDuke58> token onlystar is, but token sym:<onlystar> is just the '{*}'

[21:04] <b2gills> I used {*} in my `bytes.p6` byte counting program https://gist.github.com/b2gills/93d1e2aa6583b95315b2

[21:04] <b2gills> It made it so all of the counting happened in the MAIN proto. The rest of the multis of MAIN just returned a byte array or similar.
