[09:01] <jmerelo> I would appreciate somebody checked out the proposal I'm preparing for season of docs https://perl-foundation-outreach.github.io/season-of-docs-ideas/proposal-2021

[09:01] <jmerelo> (and any help as mentor will be also appreciated and also included in the budget)

[09:07] <MasterDuke> some inconsistency in the capitalization of "yet another society" and "code of conduct". "is’s" -> "it's". unclosed paren started here: "languages (like". IMO, "and it’s specified alongside it" would flow better without the "it's"

[09:10] <jmerelo> MasterDuke: done, thanks!
