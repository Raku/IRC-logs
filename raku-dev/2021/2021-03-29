[13:46] <raiph> .tell nine Thanks for your response in Feb about using IP6 for callbacks. :)

[13:46] <tellable6> raiph, I'll pass your message to nine

[13:58] <raiph> gfldex: Thanks. :)  (What I meant by the RakuAST reference was that I wanted to get multiple dispatch resolution, and also to elide the commas and semi-colons. That requires a slang, and I think/hope RakuAST will make a slang's actions sane for a mere mortal like me.)

[15:53] <japhb> lizmat: That, plus the fact that shorter words in English have higher entropy per letter, make words like "jazz" and "quiz" brutal for Snowman (AKA Hangman).

[15:56] <ugexe> wonder why they chose a hanging person

[15:57] <japhb> ugexe: My understanding is rather horrible history having to do with lynchings.  Hence the reason I prefer Snowman, though not everyone knows that variant.

[18:17] <cog> How come $_ becomes immutable ?

[18:18] <cog> Or do I abuse weird substances ?

[18:20] <cog> Myopia too. It complains about $a.

[18:44] <raydiak> $_ is refined inside the 'for' loop

[18:48] <japhb> What's the process for adding a new permanent #raku-* channel?  In discussion with some of the other game developers, there's interest in a #raku-gamedev channel, but (cognizant of the namespace control), I'm not sure what process we need to go through, or who needs to approve.

[18:49] <cog> Radial, It did not even cross my mind. I thought that was only for an explicit block.

[18:49] <cog> raydisk++

[18:49] <raydiak> cog: happy to help :)

[18:50] <cog> Strange because I use it all the time. How the nine work...

[18:51] <cog> * mind

[18:54] <raydiak> if you want my opinion, manipulating $_ that much suggests you may want to give an explicit name to the outer variable instead of just $_. usually makes the code easier to read when the variable has an explicit name

[18:58] <patrickb> japhb: I think there is no process for that. Also I don't think anyone would disagree to you just starting to use such a channel. What do you have in mind when you wrote "permanent"?

[19:01] <cog> Using $_ at two different level is a stink. Here a brain fart, Hope some day a Linter will detect that. I don't mind making a fool of myself. I will file an issue for LTA message.

[19:17] <japhb> patrickb: Registering it with ChanServ, having it stick around during netsplits, that sort of thing

[19:47] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[19:47] <notable6> lizmat, 4 notes: https://gist.github.com/6fe9b846974b06ab142dea33694565ec

[19:47] <tonyo> japhb: just create it unless you're looking to tag along with raku's status on chanserv

[19:53] <cog> Is there such a thing for raku ? I know there is something for MoarVM but not if this is related https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/

[19:54] <tonyo> if you try to register with chanserv they'll ask you about the organization .. i don't know if they ever verify the contacts for the organization

[19:54] <lizmat> I think Comma uses something like that, conceptually

[19:56] <japhb> OK, well, if no one has any objections, I'll create the channel and talk to mst or so about getting it ChanServ'ed.

[20:00] <japhb> Created!  :-)
