[11:23] <tyil> lizmat: Geth is back from a new server :>

[11:23] <tyil> time to find myself some breakfast

[11:24] <lizmat> tyil++

[11:24] <tyil> I've updated the DNS record to point to the new server's address too, but it may take some time for that to propagate

[11:25] <lizmat> ah, ok, so it might be a while before it actually gets pinged by Github, right ?

[11:25] <tyil> yes

[11:25] <lizmat> oki

[11:25] <tyil> (at least we won't have to update all the github repo settings anymore with this intermediate dns record :p)

[11:25] <lizmat> ack

[19:42] <ugexe> hmm, github doesn't seem to highlight raku code properly when there is indented pod

[19:44] <ugexe> i took a look at linguist but i didn't see anything like a missing \s*

[21:42] <ugexe> Comma handles indented pod properly. So does the perl text highlighter in sublime text.
