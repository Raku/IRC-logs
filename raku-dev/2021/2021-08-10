[16:55] <Xliff> \o
[16:55] <Xliff> What's the best way to introspect all "is" trait_mods?
[16:56] <sena_kun> Xliff, grep the scope for `trait_mod:<is>` named subroutines and then inspect their names? What do you mean in particular?
[16:59] <Xliff> sena_kun: "grep the scope" -- elaborate, pls?
[17:00] <Xliff> I've tried GLOBAL and MY and nothing shows.
[17:01] <sena_kun> Xliff, for core you can do:
[17:01] <sena_kun> m: for CORE::.keys { say $_ if $_.starts-with('&trait_mod') }
[17:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10b016ccf: OUTPUT: «&trait_mod:<trusts>␤&trait_mod:<hides>␤&trait_mod:<is>␤&trait_mod:<will>␤&trait_mod:<returns>␤&trait_mod:<of>␤&trait_mod:<handles>␤&trait_mod:<does>␤»
[17:02] <Xliff> Hah! sena_kun++
[17:02] <sena_kun> for external modules you need to `use` them in a scope and then do `for MY::.keys`.
