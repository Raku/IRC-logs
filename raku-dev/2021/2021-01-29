[08:09] <tellable6> 2021-01-25T19:11:50Z #raku <rba> patrickb: The new release is (finaly) installed. The website did not work to update. The error is in the email I sent you. Let me know when we can trouble-shoot it.

[08:41] <tyil> lizmat: I've just instructed IRC::Client to connect to the IP directly

[08:42] <tyil> which clearly isn't something Freenode likes, as they swap around the IPs occasionally and refuse to connect by IP from time to time (to avoid overcrowding 1 server I'm sure)

[08:42] <tyil> had to change the IP Geth uses to get him back just now

[15:18] <patrickb> lizmat: It seems https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/39d3f1368b43e967424b216783a80bb9cb9c9290 broke the JVM build.

[15:19] <lizmat> :-(    the diff doesn't strike me as particularly strange

[15:20] <lizmat> perhaps the use of nqp::ifnull as a default value for an attribute?

[15:27] <ugexe> at least before it was coercing an IntStr to an Int before assigning it to an Int constrained variable

[15:54] <lizmat> that would affect execution, not building ?

[15:57] <patrickb> hm. But it fails 

[15:58] <patrickb> during building core.d

[15:58] <lizmat> ah..., ok

[15:58] <lizmat> then it's executng core.c first

[15:58] <patrickb> is it using the freshly built core.c at that point already?

[15:59] <patrickb> https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/49b6d7b69a674b6abcf934300e359f33

[15:59] <lizmat> looks like we lost Geth

[15:59] <ugexe> maybe slap a (...).Int into a PR real quick and see if it fixes it

[15:59] <ugexe> unless there is a jvm bot here

[15:59] <lizmat> I've just pushed 7be4f5ef3821c0e73

[16:36] <ugexe> on a unrelated note this made me notice a bit of a trap... setting FOO="" will give IntStr(0,"") which is a False , not True like the empty string "" alone

[16:40] <lizmat> empty string is False, no ?

[16:45] <ugexe> ah yeah, that was a think-o. was thinking of "0"

[16:45] <lizmat> yeah, we dropped that perlism  :-)

[17:19] <ugexe> hmm looks like my first guess was it?

[17:19] <ugexe> no idea why, was just taking a wild guess

[17:22] <lizmat> seems my fix also fixed it, BTW

[17:23] <lizmat> so I'm going to leave it at that, unless you feel differently ugexe ?

[17:23] <ugexe> yeah, for all i know that PR is being build against your fix and has no bearing what so ever
