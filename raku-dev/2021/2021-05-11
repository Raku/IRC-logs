[09:08] <MasterDuke> it seems like https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/raku/nqp/runtime/Ops.java#L277-L283 (i.e., `nqp::stat('path/to/file', nqp::const::STAT_CHANGETIME)`) is hitting the Exception path on windows

[09:13] <MasterDuke> so i think https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/t/nqp/019-file-ops.t#L222-L223 needs to be todo'ed for jvm/windows

[09:14] <lizmat> but Windows also has the concept of modification time on files, does it not ?

[09:14] <MasterDuke> the case right above is for mtime

[09:19] <MasterDuke> moarvm uses uv_fs_stat, wonder what it does

[09:20] <MasterDuke> "windows: Re-implement uv_fs_stat. The st_ctime field now contains the change windows: Re-implement uv_fs_stat. The st_ctime field now contains the change", well that's from their 2013.08.25 changelog

[09:21] <lizmat> hmmm

[09:28] <lizmat> I seem to draw a blank:

[09:29] <lizmat> If I want to sort numerically in reverse order, then I can prefix a - to the condition

[09:29] <lizmat> m: dd ^10 .pick(*).sort( -*)

[09:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0).Seq␤»

[09:30] <lizmat> but we don't have a string equivalent for that, right?

[09:30] <lizmat> m: dd <a b c d e f g h i j>.pick(*).sort.reverse

[09:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «("j", "i", "h", "g", "f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a").Seq␤»

[09:30] <lizmat> that's the only way, right ?

[09:36] <raydiak> m: say sort { $^b leg $^a }, "a".."j"

[09:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «(j i h g f e d c b a)␤»

[09:40] <lizmat> yeah, but that would not do a Schwartzian transform under the hood

[09:40] <lizmat> sorry, should have been more explicit

[09:46] <MasterDuke> m: dd <a b c d e f g h i j>.pick(*).sort(-*.ord)

[09:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «("j", "i", "h", "g", "f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a").Seq␤»

[09:54] <lizmat> yeah, that'd work for single chars

[10:14] <raydiak> m: say sort -«*.ords, "aa".."aj"

[10:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «(aj ai ah ag af ae ad ac ab aa)␤»

[10:14] <raydiak> single-argument variable-length reverse string sort, but I doubt sorting a list of lists is more efficient than using .reverse

[10:25] <lizmat> yeah..

[10:26] <lizmat> and I'm now considering the validity of .sort returning a .Seq on a sorted list, instead of just the sorted list

[10:26] <lizmat> as .reverse on a list won't need to copy, just use a special iterator that starts at the end

[10:31] <MasterDuke> m: dd <bad bat a c d e f g h i j>.pick(*).sort(&infix:<lt>)

[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «("j", "i", "h", "g", "f", "e", "d", "c", "bat", "bad", "a").Seq␤»
