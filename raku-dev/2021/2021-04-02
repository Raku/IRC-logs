[06:53] <japhb> FWIW, I don't think it's fair to criticize someone for trying to do the right thing, especially if your comment about "Needless virtue signalling" is aimed at the module owner.

[10:27] <releasable6> sena_kun, Next release in ≈15 days and ≈8 hours. 2 blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[10:27] <releasable6> sena_kun, Details: https://gist.github.com/ae66f289dbe54e9308d3de5e8a984674

[10:52] <AlexDaniel`> Bashing people for breaking things is fine, but master→main transition is inevitable. Everyone will do it eventually just to keep things consistent.

[10:53] <AlexDaniel`> github already defaults to main, git itself warns that it will eventually

[10:53] <AlexDaniel`> so brace yourselves 😇

[10:56] <AlexDaniel`> I'm personally very tempted to change all my repos to main. Not really because of any message, but because if I will make that move eventually anyway then earlier is just better for me.

[11:34] <nine> AlexDaniel`: no, bashing people is not fine, at all. Bashing people does not create a welcoming and healthy community. It also doesn't teach anyone anything. It's pointless and harmful.
