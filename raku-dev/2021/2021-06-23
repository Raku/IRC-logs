[09:05] <raydiak> Anyone around? I need some advice. My contribution was reverted (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4426), but as far as I can tell, it is the test itself which is flawed (https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S26-documentation/02-paragraph.t#L118-L125)

[09:09] <raydiak> those escapes are not valid html entity names. afaik, that *should* fail. it just didn't at the time the test was written because we didn't support html entities, it just blindly spat back out whatever lowercase string was put in E<>

[09:11] <raydiak> the original issue leading to this test (https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/6293) was that S26-documentation.pod failed to render with --doc=test. with the html entity support enabled, it renders without error

[09:13] <raydiak> basically, my questions are: is there some part of the spec I'm unaware of which makes `E<a;b>E<a;b;c>` valid? if so, please point me to it

[09:16] <raydiak> if I should fix the test, is it acceptable for me to just push the commit myself? pretty sure I have commit access to roast. or is there a more appropriate procedure to follow these days?

[09:20] <raydiak> and if I fix it, then the test will fail until I make another PR to revert the reversion of my patch (which ironically was itself a reversion), and somebody merges it. so do I fix the test first, or rakudo first? I imagine this situation exists all the time, I just don't know what our procedure is

[09:28] <raydiak> ^^^^ ~~ s/'--doc=test'/--doc=text/

[09:30] <lizmat> create a PR to fix the test, and indicate that it needs to be done together with a PR to rakudo

[09:31] <lizmat> would that work for you ?

[09:35] <raydiak> well sure, there isn't really a wrong answer here. I'm just asking what our standard operating procedures are. that sounds like a reasonable plan to me. make both PRs, and indicate in each that they go along with eachother so someonoe with commit access to both can merge them at the same time, right?

[09:36] *** squashable6 left
[09:36] <raydiak> I guess most of y'all have commit access to both, so I guess this isn't a real common problem after all
