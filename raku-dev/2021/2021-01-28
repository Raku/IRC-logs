[13:07] <MasterDuke> lizmat: you're assigning to .item?

[13:07] <lizmat> if it's not an item that will fail ?

[13:09] <MasterDuke> ah

[13:12] <lizmat> I'm not sure how otherwise to test for containership, without using nqp ?

[13:24] <MasterDuke> at first glance it just looked like the classic = vs == typo

[13:32] <lizmat> hmmm... I guess $a.VAR.^name would be a better test

[13:32] <lizmat> m: my $a = 42; dd $a.VAR.^name

[21:59] <lizmat> weird

[22:00] <lizmat> so maybe the issue is with some module

[22:00] <lizmat> so putting it in /etc/hosts is not going to make a difference?

[22:00] <lizmat> perhaps using the IP number in the code doing the connect ?
