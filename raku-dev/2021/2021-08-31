[10:13] <nine> Oh darn. Setting RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS to anything doesn't have any effect. Why? Because we create the ThreadPoolScheduler object during the settings compilation.
[10:16] <MasterDuke> doh!
[10:16] <lizmat> ??   I think it is set during execution ?
[10:16] <lizmat> are you saying it gets serialized ?
[10:22] <nine> Apparently so. As can be seen by the absence of any "Created scheduler" message, when run with RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG=1
[10:22] <lizmat> wow
[10:22] <lizmat> that's bad, I'd say?
[10:23] <lizmat>  but but the settings compilation doesn't do any shelling or start or anything async that I know of?
[10:24] <nine> Indeed. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/core_prologue.pm6#L82
[10:28] <lizmat> WOT
[10:30] <nine> One can work around this somewhat with PROCESS::<$SCHEDULER> = my $*SCHEDULER = ThreadPoolScheduler.new(:max-threads(4));
[10:30] <lizmat> but, that's execution, is it not ?
[10:30] <nine> The documented way of just setting $*SCHEDULER is not enough
[10:30] <nine> But I still get the impression that 2 schedulers are active

[15:03] <Kaiepi> MasterDuke, is the read of @!concretizations relevant to the lock in Metamodel::Concretization.'!maybe_rebuild_table'?
[15:11] <MasterDuke> not sure what you mean. which read?
[15:13] <Kaiepi> if nqp::elems(%new_conc_table) < nqp::elems(@!concretizations)
[15:15] <Kaiepi> i think there's a way to make it more sparing with the nqp::objectid calls, just how it would be done depends on where that condition needs to be
[15:19] <vrurg> Kaiepi: it is now me missing the point. How could objectid replace number of elements?
[15:26] <vrurg> MasterDuke: a side note. There is another potential race we've missed in Concretization.add_concretization method. Resetting of %!conc_table is not protected. This may result in delayed cache update if %new_conc_table gets assigned too early. I'll try to remember to take care of this when done with pseudos.
[15:28] <Kaiepi> because %new_conc_table is a clone of %!conc_table, it already has each of the concretizations that existed in the prior call to !maybe_rebuild_table. with the size of the clone, you get the starting position of any newly added concretizations in @!concretizations, since those can only be appended
[15:29] <Kaiepi> the resetting of %!conc_table can go that way

[21:46] <japhb> When your own code doesn't even appear on the first *page* of exclusive-sorted profile output, sorting by entries (total call count) puts the bootstrap and setting in the top slots, and inclusive time shows nothing but concurrency code ...  >.<
[21:47] <[Coke]> ww
[21:52] <japhb> Even on a per-call basis, a naive reading would indicate that *by far* the slowest routines are in the scheduler.  Which I'm guessing most likely means that's an area that the profiler doesn't have enough visibility into.  :-(
[21:53] * japhb rages against his machine for a bit
[21:58] <japhb> Is there a way to "name" an anon block so that it appears as such in the profile data, but without causing a performance difference?  I finally found a view on the SQL profile that was actually showing me heavy bits of my own code, and it was mostly anon blocks.
[21:59] <japhb> Also, is there any way to see when a Raku problem is suffering lock or queue contention?
[21:59] <japhb> *program
[22:15] *** rakuUser joined
[22:19] *** rakuUser left
[22:19] *** rakuUser joined
[22:49] *** MasterDuke joined
[22:49] <MasterDuke> japhb: perf maybe?
[22:54] <japhb> MasterDuke: Hmmmm.  Any guidelines on using that with Rakudo?
[23:22] <MasterDuke> i use `MVM_JIT_PERF_MAP=1 perf record -z -g --call-graph dwarf raku <...>`
[23:32] <MasterDuke> and then `perf report --call-graph=none --no-children`
[23:49] <japhb> Why use --call-graph on the record and --call-graph=none on the report?
