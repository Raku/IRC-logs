[13:13] <lizmat> ugexe  nine   module precomp question

[13:13] <lizmat> if I have module Foo installed 

[13:14] <lizmat> and working on module Bar, testing that with -Ilib or -I. , should it re-precompile module Foo in lib/.precomp / .precomp ?

[13:29] <lizmat> if it shouldn't, then we have a problem here, because it looks like it does

[13:30] <lizmat> I found out that after a Rakudo update, testing some module would fail because OO::Monitors would have a version mismatch

[13:30] <lizmat> nuking the lib/.precomp dir solves that for me

[15:00] <vrurg> lizmat: with regard to sort performance on junctions, it shouldn't be slower than the multi-dispatch we currently do on cmp. And it could be done with with `nqp::eqaddr` which must be cheaper than `istype`.

[15:22] *** linkable6 joined
[16:09] *** bdmatatu left
[16:36] <lizmat> it's an extra check on *every* value that needs to be sorted, though
