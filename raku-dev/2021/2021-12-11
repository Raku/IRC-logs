[00:00] <pussies_slayer_9> I'm quite surprised since I tought raku would be faster than perl when dealing with ints

[00:01] <pussies_slayer_9> nah it's more than 10x slower

[00:01] <pussies_slayer_9> more like 12x

[00:03] <pussies_slayer_9> lots of garbage collection

[00:07] <japhb> Hello!  First, for good discussion, please choose a nick that is not insulting to the channel members.  Second, it is off hours for the channel, so don't expect responses immediately.  Third, the startup time of rakudo is more than the runtime of the perl call, so you're not getting a good comparison of runtime speed.  Fourth, Raku has a builtin for that operation.  :-)

[00:08] <pussies_slayer_9> japhb I'm pretty sure that the problem here is not startup time

[00:09] <japhb> For the $int case, half of your runtime is startup.

[00:09] <pussies_slayer_9> just run it longer by adding zeros to the rangfe

[00:09] <pussies_slayer_9> it's still the same performance ratio

[00:10] <pussies_slayer_9> I think that the real differnce is that perl consider += a single operation while raku expands it to a = a + b

[00:10] <pussies_slayer_9> that is not the same unless the compiler is smart enough

[00:10] <pussies_slayer_9> in optimizing

[00:13] *** pussies_slayer_9 is now known as immoral_hazard

[00:13] <immoral_hazard> I hope this is new nick is not as offensive

[00:14] <japhb> Better, I think.

[00:18] <japhb> In any case, if you're interested in trying to figure out what all is going on, you might want to look at the output of `raku --target=ast` and `raku --target=optimize` and see what the compiler is making of the code.

[00:18] <japhb> (perl has modules that do similar things, but I haven't used them in quite a long time, so I don't know what is current)

[00:21] <immoral_hazard> I've seen the output of that, it seems quite simple

[00:22] * japhb shrugs

[00:23] <japhb> QAST is undergoing a from-scratch rewrite next year.

[00:23] <japhb> Well, that's the current plan, anyway

[00:23] <immoral_hazard> cool

[00:24] <immoral_hazard> I suspect that escape analysis will help more with my example

[00:24] <japhb> immoral_hazard: That's also on a short list to be upgraded.  :-)

[00:25] <tonyo> bench: my $int += $_ for 0..300000
