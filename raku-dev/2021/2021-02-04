[11:02] <nine> This is the second failure of this kind: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/rakudo/rakudo/2587/workflows/d8fea1bb-ab92-4dbc-847b-4099e7b5555a/jobs/10171

[11:02] <nine> t/09-moar/11-inline-hash-key.t .................................. Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)

[11:09] <MasterDuke> well, on my remove_spesh_optimization_if_it_has_too_many_deopts branch (and the make_MVMSpeshCandidate branch before i fixed all the problems), if i don't set GC_DEBUG = 3, then the consistent segfault i get is always in MVM_str_hash_key_is_valid. maybe there's something about the hash code that makes likely-not-related problems appear there

[11:44] <nine> MasterDuke: that test seems to fail consistently on Mac OS

[11:45] <nine> I've now run it 3 times and it always failed

[11:46] <Altai-man_> yay, a blocker

[11:57] <lizmat> nine: that link requires me to give CircleCI access to *all* of my repos, including my private ones

[11:57] <lizmat> so that's a nono

[11:58] <lizmat> at least for me  :-(

[12:02] <nine> lizmat: it doesn't say any more than that line I posted :/

[12:02] <lizmat> ah, ok 

[12:03] <lizmat> BTW, time for another MoarVM bump?

[12:13] <lizmat> I'll take that as a yes :-)

[13:07] <MasterDuke> i haven't gotten any segfaults, etc in that test yet, but running it in a loop with a spectest running at the same time produces lots of test fails because AT-KEY wasn't inlined

[13:08] <MasterDuke> oh, i do have moarvm built with --optimize=0

[18:07] <tbrowder> lizmat: thnx,

[18:08] <tbrowder> lizmat: i haven't looked yet but does it use the atom format?

[18:08] <tbrowder> as well as rss?

[18:08] <lizmat> I have no idea what the format in that file is... I just copy pasted any changes  :-)

[19:19] <[Coke]> lizmat: https://github.com/Raku/planet.raku.org/blob/master/perlanetrc mentions raku-infra which doesn't appear to be a thing.

[19:20] <lizmat> then it should probably be removed ?

[19:20] <[Coke]> oops. nevermind, I had a typo.

[19:20] <lizmat> I removed some dead entries a while ago

[19:20] <[Coke]> (you're in the correctly spelled one.)

[20:59] <lizmat> ah... it takes the highest number found, for baggy addition use (+)

[22:18] <tyil> can anyone tell me who signs the rakudo-moar package as found on rakudo.org? the key ID is 7A6C9EB8809CFEAF0ED4E09F18C438E6FF24326D

[22:22] <MasterDuke> it's probably Altai-man_/sena_kun

[22:38] <Altai-man_> that's me

[22:40] <Altai-man_> Anything I can be helpful with?

[22:44] <Altai-man_> `gpg2 --search-keys 7A6C9EB8809CFEAF0ED4E09F18C438E6FF24326D` gives me `Naoum Hankache [email@hidden.address] so this is not me.
