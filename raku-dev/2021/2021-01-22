[11:27] * lizmat misses the ping of Geth  :-(

[11:27] * lizmat just added MoarVM::SIL  https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7f90c71c38155aed4835e0e9c98c6b4c93913067

[11:45] <sena_kun> timotimo, ping?

[11:46] <timotimo> pong

[11:46] <timotimo> geth wants kicked?

[11:46] <sena_kun> timotimo, I am writing a moarvm changelog. I see lots of your commits about Invoke message. Can I document it was "implemented" or it is not yet complete?

[11:47] <sena_kun> In debug server, I mean.

[11:47] <timotimo> let me double-check, but i did implement a lot of it

[11:47] <timotimo> it doesn't handle invoked things throwing exceptions, but whatever debug helper library you're using should catch and handle any exceptions for you i think

[11:48] <sena_kun> timotimo, well, I am interesting in how to document those commits in the changelog. :)

[11:48] <timotimo> yeah, you can say it's implemented

[11:49] <sena_kun> +

[11:49] <sena_kun> afk

[16:40] <tyil> timotimo: due to said personal circumstances the kubernetes cluster is pretty dead right now

[16:40] <tyil> I think I'll just take one server and make it a bot server for Raku bots

[17:02] <timotimo> OK, i've not been paying enough attention to .. anything?
