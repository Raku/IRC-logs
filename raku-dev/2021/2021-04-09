[22:31] <softmoth> Does anyone here know how to restart modules.raku.org after merging a new fix?

[22:32] <softmoth> I know it needs to run the update-modules.perl6.org script, but not sure how to request that

[22:36] <MasterDuke> no idea, maybe ask rba

[22:45] <softmoth> thanksâ€¦

[22:46] <softmoth> it's nothing urgent, just scratching an itch
