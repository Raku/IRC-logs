[02:59] <AlexDaniel`> well, I'd say not all of them need to be fixed for a release, but do make it a hard rule that we must have less known flappers every release than we had before

[02:59] <AlexDaniel`> that should keep the motivation high and releases going

[03:00] <AlexDaniel`> so no known flappers in 8 months? Sounds good to me

[09:02] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, there is a difference between "not all flappers fixed" and "the ticket is simply ignored by various reasons by devs".

[09:03] <AlexDaniel`> Whoops

[09:04] * sena_kun has more time to work on the website though

[10:20] <sena_kun> lizmat, ping. If you're going to mention the docs demo, its new home is http://raku-infra-fsn1-01.rakulang.site:10012/ we set up with rba++ yesterday.

[10:21] <lizmat> will do

[10:22] <sena_kun> lizmat, and just as before, we are looking for volunteers to complete it ASAP. :)

[10:22] <lizmat> what do you want the volunteers to do ?

[10:24] <sena_kun> lizmat, I think we mostly need JS writers, but any other help (hosting advices, my bad Raku code audit etc) is welcome, https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/issues <-

[10:25] <lizmat> ok, so help solving issues in that repo, right ?

[10:25] <sena_kun> lizmat, yes, pretty much.

[17:02] <cj> RIP, DrForr.  Miss you, bud.

[17:03] <cj> I had the honor of sharing a city with him for a short period of time.  I had been IRC'ing with him since the late 90s, and finally got to meet him in person while I was working at Shiftboard in Seattle.

[17:26] <tbrowder> hi, ref my rakudo issue #%

[17:27] <tbrowder> #4250, why is it 'unhuffmanized'?

[17:27] <tbrowder> 'frac' that is...

[17:50] <ugexe> what i meant was the functionality does not seem common enough to warrant a 4 letter function vs something like fractional-foo

[17:54] <ugexe> maybe i dont do enough math, but 'frac' doesn't give me a clear idea what it does and i've never used such a function. the function apparent exists in some old programming lanaguages(?) but why would we inherit that name if the majority of our users will not already know that? wouldn't they prefer something more descriptive?

[17:58] <ugexe> but i'm not concerned with the name so much as i was with having multiple names that doing something similar

[19:32] <tonyo_> nine: i know this was something we looked at in .. 2018 or 19 but any idea if // building still causes precomp problems?

[19:32] *** domidumont left
[19:34] <nine> tonyo_: if what?

[19:34] <tonyo_> if parallel building

[19:36] <nine> should be fine

[19:36] <tonyo_> great, thank you

[19:42] <nine> If there are issues it would be a good time to fix them anyway

[19:46] <tonyo_> fairly bored? : )
