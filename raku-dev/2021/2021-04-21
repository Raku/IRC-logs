[17:10] <tbrowder> hi, anyone here care to talk about rap

[17:11] <tbrowder> *not rap, DateTime class and family classes?

[17:13] <tbrowder> lizmat doesn't want to add any attrs, but what about changing Dateish attr daycount to  Num or Real instead of an Int

[17:19] *** domidumont left
[17:45] <japhb> tbrowder: Hmmm, I think people may have come to expect daycount to be a whole number at this point.  Could do a search of the ecosystem and see what's there in modules at least.

[19:55] <tbrowder>  good point, thnx.

[19:56] <tbrowder> maybe a version E thing

[19:57] <tonyo> are you thinking to store fraction of the day in it?

[19:59] <tbrowder> yes, kind of. if we can do it with ver E i would like to just make it julian-date (or modified-julian-date) and contain the fraction

[19:59] <tbrowder> and remove daycount

[20:00] <tonyo> iirc dateish is just the date and not actually the time, no?

[20:01] <tonyo> or, it contains no time info?

[20:01] <tbrowder> yes, but it also included earlier and later which uses time. if using datish and making it modfied-julisn

[20:02] <tbrowder> *modified-julian-date the fraction would be zero for a date with zeros for time

[20:08] <[Tux]> test-t              1.062 -  1.078

[20:09] <[Tux]> but all "use Text::CSV_XS:from<Perl5>;"'s ones fail, so it needs more work on that box

[20:20] <[Tux]> fixed

[20:21] <[Tux]> (zef required --exclude=perl)

[20:24] <[Tux]> I added install/share/perl6/core/precomp to the cleanup process before the process: it grew *HUGE*

[20:27] <[Tux]> It had no influence on the test results. almost the same, but I expected nothing else.

[20:33] <tbrowder> if i try this major change PR for version 'e' would i start with new versions of the changed classes in src/core.e?
