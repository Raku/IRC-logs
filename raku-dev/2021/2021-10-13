[00:33] <ggoebel> vrurg: thanks for working on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4557 -It now fails, but for a different reason. Should I re-open it or open a new issue?
[00:34] <vrurg> ggoebel: let me guess, it can't find `python`?
[00:35] <ggoebel> the EXISTS-KEY not found failure is now a python not found failure
[00:35] <ggoebel> yep
[00:35] <vrurg> I think it worth separate issue. Perhaps in module's repository.
[00:36] <ggoebel> ok
[00:38] <vrurg> Looking at last commits, the module could have bitrotted already.
