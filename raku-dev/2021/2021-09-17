[11:39] <celo_duro> coke codesections : renaming master and slave branch to main and something else branch. Do anyone gets some money when they do that?
[11:39] <celo_duro> like I can imagine George Soros or some other billionaire to actually pay people to renaming branches
[11:40] <celo_duro> i would never do that for free
[11:41] <celo_duro> And I look upon with severe eyes anyone claiming to do that for free

[12:55] <ugexe> yeah take the money codesections
[12:56] <timo> heck yeah, rakudo could definitely benefit from some soros bucks
[12:57] <timo> camelia is already spooky-scary with her strong saturated colors
[12:59] <timo> and raku.org with its pastel colors, why that's clearly a strong influence that's turning men from barbaric warrior-machines to kitten-cuddlers and laundry-folders
[13:00] <timo> and each week we have a veiled threat in the weekly to take the "vaccine"! it says "stay safe!". you can practically smell the "or else" in that sentence
[13:00] <timo> all good reasons for george soros to sponsor our little rag-tag group of silly people
[13:01] <timo> sorry, inappropriately political for the -dev channel, probably
