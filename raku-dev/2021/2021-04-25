[06:13] <japhb> CBOR::Simple 0.0.4 is now out and uploaded; lots more performance work this time.  Still can't beat JSON::Fast on its home turf of arrays of hashes with ASCII string keys and values (sigh), but already faster on a few things, like handling Nums, Rats (which JSON::Fast treats as Nums), and blobs.
