[00:56] <japhb> tbrowder: ^^ Precedence

[00:56] <japhb> m: say -1.5e0 .abs

[00:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «1.5␤»

[00:57] <japhb> ^^ You can also lower the method call precedence that way too

[01:00] <raydiak> shouldn't the negative be parsed as part of the term, instead of a prefix op?

[01:01] <tbrowder> ok, cool. so are you saying there is no error

[01:04] <tbrowder> so i need to rewrite my tests

[01:07] <japhb> raydiak: It would be if you were giving it as a literal:

[01:08] <japhb> m: say <-1.5e0>.abs

[01:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «1.5␤»

[01:08] <japhb> Which is really

[01:08] <japhb> m: say (BEGIN val(-1.5e0)).abs

[01:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «Value of type Num uselessly passed to val()␤1.5␤  in code  at <tmp> line 1␤»

[01:08] <japhb> m: say (BEGIN val("-1.5e0")).abs

[01:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «1.5␤»

[01:09] <japhb> ^^ that, more or less

[01:12] <raydiak> I see. why do we not try to parse it as a literal first even without the <>, before assuming it's a prefix or postfix?

[01:19] <raydiak> I suppose that would make it impossible to write a prefix "-" op for a positive literal number, among other things
