[09:09] <MasterDuke> very interesting. https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/src/NQP/Compiler.nqp#L44-L53 has the same `#?if moar ... ` business with `@ARGS` vs `*@ARGS` that https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/main.nqp and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/rakudo-debug.nqp do

[09:10] <MasterDuke> and easier to experiment with since i don't get that circular module error when trying to run multiple times

[09:11] <MasterDuke> and it's been that way for 8 years

[09:12] <MasterDuke> if i change the `#?if moar` version to match the others, then the nqp build seems to drop into a repl, where ^D starts the next step in the build

[09:14] <MasterDuke> there were mentions of parrot with an 'XXX FIX ME' in previous versions, so i have no idea what's the correct behavior

[09:43] <MasterDuke> feb 24

[09:43] <lizmat> dogbert17: the sub version is currently faster as it doesn't dispatch to the method version

[09:43] <lizmat> this will be corrected in the coming days

[09:43] <dogbert17> ++lizmat, I had a feeling it was on your radar :)

[09:43] <dogbert17> so what can we do about camelia then?

[09:47] <lizmat> could be nine, could be moritz_ ?
