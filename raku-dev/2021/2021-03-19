[21:35] <sena_kun> A proofreading is welcome. :)

[21:37] <sena_kun> I'll do some builds tomorrow, the Blin is clean, CI is fine, we got some moving towards the flappers.

[21:37] <sena_kun> I hope I did not raise a point flag just now.

[21:37] <moon-child> 'Remove `utf32` from encodings lists for MoarVM,' , should be ; (or even .)

[21:37] <moon-child> 'Make `>>.` construct faster' should be 'the `>>.` construct' (or just take out 'construct' instead)

[21:39] <MasterDuke> sena_kun++ again

[21:40] <sena_kun> moon-child, thank you very much! I'll patch it right away. By the way, I see `Moonchild` in the list of this release contributors, do you want to be named in some other way?

[21:40] <sena_kun> Changed to "Remove `utf32` from encodings lists for MoarVM. This encoding was never supported before" to avoid ambiguous "it".

[21:41] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5bb1afaa898b3ebaa3f6922ed247506da2f7379f <- updated one

[21:41] <moon-child> sena_kun: nah that's fine...I have no idea why I'm on that list, though ;o

[21:42] <moon-child> maybe docs stuff?

[21:43] <sena_kun> moon-child, roger. Yes, docs are included.
