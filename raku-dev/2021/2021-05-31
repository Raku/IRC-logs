[10:48] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: they are generally used as classes with their default parameterization.

[16:49] <japhb> lizmat: There are some games that want exactly the behavior you're talking about in your RFC.  Modern Tetris variants, for example, guarantee that you'll cycle through the different shapes (in random order each time, but always completing a set before going to the next)

[17:11] *** patrickb joined
[18:04] *** reportable6 joined
[19:15] <lizmat> japhb: the reason I was suggesting it was cycling through colors for colorizing nicks in IRC logs :-)

[19:26] <moon-child> hmm, I feel like in that case you would want it to be weighted

[19:26] <moon-child> so if a new person joins, their colour is different from the colours of the people who are currently acativ

[19:26] <moon-child> or hell maybe you even do graph partitioning to try to reduce overlap.  I am definitely overengineering this :P

[19:31] *** donaldh joined
[19:31] <lizmat> moon-child: well, I'd also like the coloring of nicks to be consistent for all of the days on the channel  :-)

[19:32] <lizmat> but for a certain design and background, you would need to exclude a lot of colors because of lack of contrast

[19:33] <moon-child> right, but in the event that someone who's never been in the channel before joins, wouldn't you want to make their colour contrast with those of the people that are actually talking, rather than contrasting with all of the people who have ever been in the channel?

[19:43] <lizmat> I'm more worried about the contrast with the design, then the contrast difference between nocks

[19:43] <lizmat> *nicks

[19:44] <lizmat> you would seldom see those nicks close enough to not make a difference :-)
