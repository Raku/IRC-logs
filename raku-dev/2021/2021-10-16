[12:22] <sena_kun> lizmat, ping?

[12:27] <sena_kun> I made the padding between same-nick messages smaller and IMO the readability became worse despite it taking less space: https://ibb.co/KrT4zqz and https://ibb.co/fD7qdKF

[12:28] <sena_kun> So I'd refrain from it unless you insist, in this case ping me to share the CSS fix.

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: [JVM] Align p6setfirstflag with modern use

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: The way p6setfirstflag is used was changed recently (with 84da856ae6).

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: This adjusts the op for the JVM backend accordingly. Thanks to jnthn++

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: for pointing out the fix.

[16:23] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/02c13fad8d

[16:34] <ugexe> seems like maybe `use lib ...` is causing precompilation to occur again? for instance `raku -I. bin/zef --help` precompiles, then `raku -I. -Ilib bin/zef --help` precompiles again since the repo id would change. However then doing `raku -I. bin/zef --help` precompiles yet again (even though it was already precompiled the first time)

[16:35] <ugexe> nine: any clue what im missing given this behavior?

[16:36] <MasterDuke> hasn't there been a longstanding problem with (some?) things getting precompiled again when they shouldn't? so maybe now it's just worse?

[16:40] <ugexe> i always thought the problem was things not getting reprecompiled when they should

[16:41] <MasterDuke> oh, maybe it was that. now i'm not sure

[17:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: I'm not totally sure if this really is all that needs to be done.

[17:23] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: But since UTF-16BE is part of Java's basic encoding set, I'd

[18:49] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Use repo id instead of distribution id for comp unit ids

[18:49] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[18:49] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: The distribution id doesn't account for changes in the repo chain, and thus an existing precomp .repo-id file could be overwritten each time a different set of repos gets used. This replaces the use of distribution id with the repo id which accounts for said different sets of repos.

[18:49] <ugexe> MasterDuke: does that fix it for the spec test case?

[19:23] *** linkable6 left
[20:48] <MasterDuke> ugexe: i just pulled, built, and ran a spectest. no change. do i need to delete .precomp directories?

[20:50] <ugexe> no that shouldn't be needed. it fixed the way i was reproducing a reprecompile with the commands above so i assumed the roast would be doing something similar with its various `use lib ...`

[21:02] <ugexe> i wonder if i move the `use lib ...` statements to the top if it'll go faster

[21:19] <ugexe> trying to find a few files or a directory that by itself reproduces it
