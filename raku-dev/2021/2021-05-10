[10:28] <lizmat> one of my regular places to check for Raku news seems to have vanished ?  http://blogs.perl.org

[10:28] <lizmat> seems to have dropped from DNS ?

[10:28] <lizmat> ah, seems to affect the whole perl.org domain  at least for me

[10:28] *** dogbert11 left
[10:28] <nwc10> blogs.perl.org has address 188.40.132.3

[10:30] <lizmat> so it is working for you?

[10:32] <nwc10> yes

[10:32] <lizmat> weird

[10:32] <nwc10> yes

[10:33] <nwc10> just tested from 2 other machines which I think are in two other countries, and they are happy

[10:33] <nwc10> so, most strange

[10:33] <lizmat> ok, lemme see if there's more domains broken for me

[10:35] <lizmat> so far, perl.org appears the only one broken for me

[10:36] <nwc10> all 6 perl.org nameservers are talking to me

[10:41] <lizmat> yeah, I guess it's  our IP's DNS servers who are on the blink

[10:41] <lizmat> changed our router's DNS settings to use Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) for now and all is fine again

[21:11] <bartolin_> MasterDuke: sorry, I don't know about the state of nqp-j (and rakudo-j) on windows. I think it has been some time since I last tried to run it on windows.

[21:12] <bartolin_> do you know, perchance, if these are new failures?

[21:14] <MasterDuke> heh, that's what i am trying to determine

[21:14] <bartolin_> ;)

[21:17] <bartolin_> right, what I wanted to ask is, whether you know if the tests have only recently be added to the CI pipeline. I'm not familiar with the CI pipeline

[21:18] <MasterDuke> i don't think they're new tests

[21:19] <MasterDuke> or new to the pipeline

[21:20] <MasterDuke> but i've been changing the pipeline a bit, and i'm hoping my changes to how nqp/rakudo are built and how the tests are run aren't at fault

[22:27] <MasterDuke> oh, the nqp tests weren't being run before for the combination of jvm backend and windows os

[22:29] <MasterDuke> consistently three failing tests in t/nqp/019-file-ops.t (28, 64, 100)
