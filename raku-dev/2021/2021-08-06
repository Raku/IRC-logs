[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: ACCEPTS on a signature given a signature rather repetitive in that it

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: needs to iterate over each parameter in both signatures before

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: performing any typechecks, demanding a second iteration in all cases. If

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: a schema for the RHS is built by passing over its parameters once, then

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: typechecks for each parameter in the LHS can be shortcircuited sooner,

[12:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: leaving any extraneous parameters from the RHS to pass over once more.
