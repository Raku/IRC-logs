[06:41] <gfldex> is this LTA?

[06:43] <gfldex> It's a v6.e feature. Could be quite confusing for a beginner.

[06:43] <gfldex> (This may be a big question.)

[08:27] <nine> People ought to get used to declaring the language version early on.

[10:17] <gfldex> nine: exactly my point. We could tell them to do so in a proper error message.

[10:20] <nine> Can we?

[10:22] <gfldex> We still have a few features in v6.c left that throw NYI. Instead we could throw X::ImpelemtendIn.new('v6.e') .

[10:23] <[Coke]> My brain think that sounds like too much magic, but it is only 6am or so here.

[10:23] <[Coke]> so no cogent arguments just yet.

[10:23] <[Coke]> also, I apparently need to update my rakudo, because that gives the same error in 6.e here.

[10:40] <nine> gfldex: that requires adding a multi candidate that would throw. This multi candidate would then show up in introspection as well. Question is: is this better?

[11:59] <MasterDuke> add `is implementation-detail`?

[20:07] <gfldex> nine: I think it could be done without a multi candidate. All we want is a better error message and the one we got right now is a SORRY.

[20:08] <nine> how?

[20:10] <gfldex> We could special case the error message itself in 6.c and 6.d but not 6.e.
