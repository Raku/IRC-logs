[16:03] <lizmat> PSA: log server will be down for a bit for server upgrades

[16:04] *** hankache joined
[16:05] <Tux__> is(some-call(args),""|Str,'this call can return "" or Undefined Str')

[16:05] <Tux__> ‚Üí

[16:05] <Tux__> Cannot unbox a type object (Str) to a str

[16:05] <Tux__> is that counter-intuitive or did I go over the limit

[16:06] *** hankache left
[16:06] <lizmat> how is Undefined defined ?

[16:06] <lizmat> :-)

[16:07] <Tux__> an Str typed value with no content at all

[16:08] <Tux__> like ¬´Any¬ª or ¬´Str¬ª

[16:08] <lizmat> m: sub a(str $a) { }; a Str

[16:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 289a62f4a: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot unbox a type object (Str) to a str.‚ê§  in sub a at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[16:08] <lizmat> that's what you're doing somewhere

[16:11] <Tux__> m: use Test; my Str $s;is($s,""|Str,"test")

[16:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 289a62f4a: OUTPUT: ¬´not ok 1 - test‚ê§# Failed test 'test'‚ê§# at <tmp> line 1‚ê§Cannot unbox a type object (Str) to a str.‚ê§  in sub is at /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/perl6/core/sources/2D4A7CA10695CD2B374573413D261A660E282E2A (Test) line 211‚ê§  in block <unit‚Ä¶¬ª

[16:11] <Tux__> that is what I was trying

[16:12] <lizmat> is() assumes you pass it something that is a string

[16:12] <lizmat> my Str $s    is *not* a string, but a type object

[16:13] <Tux__> but, but ...

[16:13] <Tux__> m: use Test; my Str $s="x";is($s,""|"x","test")

[16:13] <leont> The error eventually comes from sub infix:<~>(Str:D $a, Junction:D $b)

[16:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 289a62f4a: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - test‚ê§¬ª

[16:13] <Tux__> Ahh, :D

[16:13] <leont> It assumes the Junction eigenstates are all defined

[16:14] <Tux__> damn

[16:14] <Tux__> thanks leont I now understand

[16:14] <leont> I don't understand why it assumes that, or if that is a correct assumption

[16:15] <Tux__> I though that I was balancing the knive's edge again

[16:15] <lizmat> m: use Test; is Str,""

[16:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 289a62f4a: OUTPUT: ¬´not ok 1 - ‚ê§# Failed test at <tmp> line 1‚ê§# expected: ''‚ê§#      got: (Str)‚ê§¬ª

[16:15] <lizmat> hmmm

[16:15] <leont> I suspect it's correct not to accept it, but that the error is less than awesome

[16:17] <lizmat> Tux__: use is-deeply vs is ?

[16:18] <Tux__> in this specific case I can be more strict by using Str instead of ""|Str. I was just curious where I went wrong given the two examples

[16:19] <lizmat> PSA: server is up again
