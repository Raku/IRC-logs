[15:12] <[Coke]> when configuring rakudo can I do --gen-moar=<sha1> ?

[15:12] <[Coke]> I know I can do branch/tags...

[15:14] <nine> probably

[15:14] <nine> For git itself it doesn't make a difference (except in very few places)

[17:15] <lizmat> [Tux] the time for another test-t is here  :-)

[17:18] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Rakudo-new-disp-branch shows 2 release blockers as a result of merge of new-disp

[17:24] <Altai-man> releasable6, status

[17:24] <releasable6> Altai-man, Next release in ≈23 days and ≈1 hour. There are no known blockers. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[17:24] <releasable6> Altai-man, Details: https://gist.github.com/293e5fac3b719efde54612056e674f87

[17:32] <lizmat> on rakudo:  107 files changed, 5554 insertions(+), 3128 deletions(-)    quite an amount of work!  :-)

[17:32] <[Coke]> so if we need to create tickets for those to tag them as blockers, we can.

[17:32] <[Coke]> lizmat: whee I did like 1 line of those! :)

[17:33] <lizmat> :-)

[22:59] <japhb> My full rakudo-and-modules rebuild script ran to (successful) completion first try on post-merge.  :-)

[23:00] <japhb> MoarVM/nqp/rakudo builds were reasonable.  Building the module stack was really slow.  I ran errands in the middle and it was still going.

[23:00] <[Coke]> hopefully runtime is better than buildtime.

[23:01] <[Coke]> jnthn did say that startup time is slightly worse atm.

[23:10] <japhb> Yeah, and I think both running lots of test files and the out-of-process precomp really shines a light on that.
