[09:31] <patrickb> lizmat: I'd value your opinion on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1385#issuecomment-782059178 Especially the "is this maybe even acceptable behavior" bit.

[09:33] <lizmat> patrickb: I'm afraid I don't have much to offer in the opinion dept.

[09:33] *** JRaspass joined
[09:33] <lizmat> I too have no idea whether that behaviour is wrong or not

[09:35] <lizmat> sorry  :-(

[09:37] <patrickb> Sadly nwc10 is very low on tuits currently. I'd love to get this fixed to finally get the "gmake fails on Windows" ticket off my table.

[09:37] <lizmat> understood

[09:38] <lizmat> perhaps jnthn could be pinged
