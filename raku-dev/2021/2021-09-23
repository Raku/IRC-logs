[17:12] <Xliff> \o

[17:13] <Xliff> lizmat: I see you are making a lot of \ -> $ optimizations on new-disp. I would have thought \a was faster than $a. So the opposite is true?

[17:13] <lizmat> Xliff: it will be in new-disp

[17:13] <lizmat> as long as the parameter can not be an Iterabl;e

[17:14] <Xliff> OIC. Thanks for the info!

[17:14] <lizmat> at least, that's my current understanding :-)

[17:15] <Xliff> I take it new-disp will start migrating to master over the next few weeks?

[17:15] <lizmat> yes, that's the idea :-)

[17:16] <lizmat> Xliff: if you want to be up-to-date on new-disp, #moarvm is the channel to be atm

[17:25] <Xliff> Ah, yes. I keep forgetting about that. :>

[17:29] <Xliff> lizmat: Did you finish your RakuAST implementation of sprintf?

[17:31] <lizmat> yes, that's sitting in the RakuAST branch

[17:32] <lizmat> for a while now already :-)

[17:44] <Xliff> lizmat: Excellent! I think I'm going to play with it for a bit. :)

[18:24] <Xliff> Anybody wanna play around on a 64-core Google Engine instance?

[18:24] <Xliff> Looks like Raku may have a parallelism bug ... or maybe my script does.

[18:24] <Xliff> Working script conks out when parallel compiling my p6-ICal project with no reason.

[18:25] <Xliff> I have no idea what to look for.

[18:27] <Xliff> If no takers, I'll pack it up and shut it down. It's costing me $3/hour

[18:28] <Xliff> I'll check again in a couple of hours.

[18:28] <lizmat> I think some people would be interested, but they're all busy doing something else, or having dinner  :-)

[18:28] <lizmat> also, I think you should also advertise / plan this on #moarvm  :-)

[18:35] <[Coke]> Also, where is the script that might be having trouble? Will get more eyes if it's in a gist or repo somewehre.

[18:38] <Xliff> [Coke]: Same place it's always been: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/scripts/dependency-build.pl6

[18:38] <Xliff> [Coke]: That script has been used without issue (concurrently level 20) for well over a year now.

[18:39] <ugexe> fwiw i dont think the trick of ordering provides works anymore since hash randomization was added years ago
