[20:00] <MasterDuke> huh. i have a new clone of nqp in a windows 10 vm, with git+strawberry perl+openjdk11 installed, and `perl .\Configure.pl --backend=jvm` succeeds, but `gmake install` dies with `gmake: *** No rule to make target 'src\vm\jvm\runtime\org\raku\nqp\io\*.java', needed by 'gen\jvm\share\runtime\nqp-runtime.jar'.  Stop.`

[20:00] <tellable6> 2021-05-11T17:09:59Z #raku-dev <bartolin_> MasterDuke: sorry, but I have no experience there

[20:07] <MasterDuke> my PATH and JAVA_HOME are set

[20:11] <MasterDuke> the makefile does have `RUNTIME_JAVAS = \

[20:11] <MasterDuke>   src\vm\jvm\runtime\org\raku\nqp\io\*.java \ ...`

[20:15] <bartolin_> MasterDuke: I have no idea about gmake on windows, but could this be a problem with \ escaping the * (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Wildcard-Pitfall.html) Does it work if you use forward slashes there?

[20:17] <MasterDuke> bartolin_++

[20:17] <MasterDuke> well, that seems to be a problem. this was a brand new clone, it should have just worked

[20:18] <bartolin_> indeed. Is this something that has to be fixed in nqp-configure?

[20:19] <MasterDuke> huh, looks fine here...https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/tools/templates/jvm/Makefile.in#L19

[20:20] <bartolin_> but it think it uses the @nfp()@ macro (is it called macro?) from nqp-configure

[20:20] <MasterDuke> hm

[20:20] <MasterDuke> akf for a while, but it is building, so making progress

[20:20] <bartolin_> and that transforms the forward slashes to backslashes.

[20:38] *** Kaiepi left
[21:05] <[Coke]> I use nmake on windows. maybe it's guessing parts of your toolchain wrong? You can tell Configure.pl when you start which toolchain you want it to use...

[21:26] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:44] <MasterDuke> all i did was install strawberry perl+git+openjdk, set env variables, clone repo, and run `perl Configure.pl --backend=jvm`, don't think i did anything out of the ordinary

[21:46] <MasterDuke> i don't have nmake installed

[23:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈5 days and ≈19 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[23:13] <[Coke]> I thinks strawberry comes with gnu-flavored tools, so that makes sense, yah, probably should have worked
