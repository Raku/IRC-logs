[07:00] <moon-child> should bug fixes generally also turn into spectests?  My intuition is yes, but it doesn't seem to happen generally, even given r3 (which makes testcases for bug reports, but those don't go into roast)

[16:00] <japhb> moon-child: If they are tests of *generally agreed Raku* functionality, yes.  If they are tests of *Rakudo-specific* functionality, they should be tested in Rakudo's individual test suite.  Then there are things that we can tell are broken currently (and so should be "fixed" with something less broken), but not sure exactly how to describe the behavior we want without limiting our options for "correct" 

[16:00] <japhb> behavior in the future.
