[11:58] <Kaiepi> R#4593 may be concretization-related

[12:02] *** reportable6 left
[13:02] *** evalable6 left
[13:04] <Kaiepi> trying to influence --stagestats output through Metamodel::Concretization doesn't seem to change that Haku is being recompiled for varying examples

[13:06] <MasterDuke> oh. it generates a new .rakumod when it runs an example, right?

[13:08] <MasterDuke> and it has '.' in the lib path. so that's going to cause a lot of re-compilation

[13:08] <MasterDuke> but it should be fine the second time

[13:09] *** discord-raku-bot left
[13:10] <MasterDuke> but yeah, every time you re-run haku with some new code it's going to cause everything to recompile

[13:10] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[13:12] <MasterDuke> ha, yeah, looks like that's what's happening
