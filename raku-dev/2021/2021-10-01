[11:01] <lizmat> nice...  :-)

[11:09] <nine> I hope I'll be able to recover Inline::Perl5's performance as well

[11:12] <lizmat> how did that suffer?   is it a general NativeCall issue ?

[11:17] <nine> Before new-disp it picked wrapper methods with 0, 1, 2 or multiple args depending on the callsite and put them directly into the multi dispatch cache: https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/blob/master/lib/Inline/Perl5/ClassHOW.pm6#L7

[11:36] <lizmat> ah, I see, so it needs new nqp::dispatch goodness  :-)

[12:02] <nine> Now there's a plot twist: the whole IP5 trickery I pointed out does not actually help performance. Seems like rakudo's multi dispatcher (at least nowadays) gives the exact same results (on 2021.09). The fastest benchmark run was even with my trickery disabled (though probably within margin of error)

[12:02] <nine> So actually I have no idea where we lose half our performance

[12:02] <nine> Could even be a NativeCall slow down

[12:56] <nine> A look at a profile suggest that it actually is a NativeCall regression

[13:10] <[Coke]> what's the magic Configure.pl invocation to force use of latest rak/nqp/moar?

[13:12] <[Coke]> do I need to do a git pull everywhere first & then force-rebuild?

[13:12] <[Coke]> perl Configure.pl --help for no-silent-build appears to have the sense reversed in the description.

[13:13] <[Coke]> (force+gen seems to do it...)

[13:14] <[Coke]> ah, no it doesn't. it did the update but then picked a specific version

[13:16] <[Coke]> --force-rebuild --gen-nqp=master --gen-moar=master

[13:25] *** [Coke] is now known as CokeZero

[13:25] *** CokeZero is now known as [Coke]

[13:33] <[Coke]> bah, build failed.

[13:38] <vrurg> [Coke]: usually when I need to rebuild with different versions I tend to do `git clean -dfx` to make sure there are no left overs.

[13:43] <[Coke]> yah, will just do this the "hard" way, no worries.

[15:58] <[Coke]> ... I built and installed moar, using master. I then separately try to build nqp, but it complains the moar it found (in the install directory I used) is too old.

[15:58] <[Coke]> oh. ^^ just very bad timing. :)
