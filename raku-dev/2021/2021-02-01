[07:29] <jmerelo> Today is a good day to take a look at StackOverflow's unanswered questions https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku?tab=Unanswered

[07:39] <jmerelo> And a reminder that we're preparing a proposal for Google Summer of Code, and we're looking for projects https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/gsoc-2021-ideas

[09:32] <MasterDuke> .tell patrickb not sure i'd seen that problem-solving PR. yeah, i'll add a comment there

[09:32] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[09:34] <MasterDuke> .tell patrickb and yep, no problems here not doing *BSDs right away, i'd just suggest making it clear in the proposal that what you're proposing would be able to be easily extended for them

[09:34] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[15:50] <tbrowder> jmerelo: i took a quick look at the list of unanswered stack overflow qests and the one entitled "Incorrect number of parameters passed to subroutine" looks like the answer is waiting for a response from the OP.

[16:19] <lizmat> yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/02/01/2021-05-gsoc-proposing/

[16:54] <jmerelo> tbrowder: right, in many cases that's the case. or waiting for them to accept one. No option but ping them, I guess.

[16:55] <jmerelo> A reminder that we're taking project proposals, as well as mentor proposals, for the upcoming application to Google Summer of Code https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/gsoc-2021-ideas

[20:51] <[Coke]> hurled a timing question on module load in #raku https://gist.github.com/coke/7d6cac113a7fa46cb1e67b9b9a38c023 - taking 20 seconds to 'use' a 32 line file.

[20:51] <lizmat> about to go afk again

[20:52] <lizmat> but perhaps running it with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 will give some clarity ?

[20:54] <[Coke]> that does give a bunch of info that I don't know if I can decode. Will dig

[20:56] <[Coke]> added the output with that to gist.

[20:56] <[Coke]> (and noted where the long pause was)

[20:57] <[Coke]> I removed the include of "Test" from the .pm, still takes 15-20s to load the module.

[20:59] <MasterDuke> how about a --profile-compile, that might be helpful

[21:01] *** finsternis left
[21:03] <[Coke]> page unresponsive. give me a sec.

[21:20] <MasterDuke> don't really know, any function taking suspiciously long, or have an oddly high number of calls?

[21:23] <MasterDuke> if it's that slow probably better to create a sql file and use moarperf

[21:57] <nine> [Coke]: how many files are in that lib directory?

[21:58] <nine> (the whole lib directory tree)

[22:03] <[Coke]> nine: 9065!

[22:03] <[Coke]> there's a "precompiled" dir in there, which I'm guessing we should not have under the 'lib' but instead under a .precompiled

[22:07] <[Coke]> nine++

[22:10] <[Coke]> yup, that did it.
