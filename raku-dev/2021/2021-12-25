[09:31] <tellable6> 2021-12-24T18:02:32Z #raku <retupmoca> lizmat I moved 8 of my repos over to raku-community-modules (most of the ones with any open issues/PRs), but I have another 17 with no collaborators; is it worth moving *all* of them over?

[09:32] <lizmat> .tell retupmoca I'd say yes, but do whatever you feel comfortable with  :-)  

[09:32] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to retupmoca
