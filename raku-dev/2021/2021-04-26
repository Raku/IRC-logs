[13:29] <AlexDaniel`> It just needed a kick for some reason, I think it would have rejoined by itself given enough time

[13:29] <AlexDaniel`> Any other boys that are down?

[13:29] <lizmat> AlexDaniel`++  

[13:29] <lizmat> I waited for ~ 2 hours and used the log to figure out weekly mentions

[13:30] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset

[13:30] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to ‚Äúweekly_2021-04-26T13:30:08Z‚Äù

[13:32] <AlexDaniel`> Bots** damn autocorrect

[13:32] <AlexDaniel`> Ok tellable seemed to be down too, everyone else rejoined by themselves

[13:33] <AlexDaniel`> Please let me know if it happens again, usually they're able to rejoin quicker
