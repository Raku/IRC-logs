[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make Array.ASSIGN-POS about 15% faster (#4170)

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: By reducing the actual fast path to a single nqp::assign, and reworking

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the tests into ternaries.  Also returns the actual container now rather

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: than a deconted value (just like Hash::ASSIGN-KEY does).

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Eliminates the FAST-PATH private method.  Removes the index < 0 check

[10:22] <linkable6> RAKUDO#4170 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4170 Make Array.ASSIGN-POS about 15% faster

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: from the SLOW-PATH as that is now being checked in the actual ASSIGN-POS

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: method (but not really acted upon, just used as a flag to take the slow

[10:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: path).
