[07:41] <nine> Oh, it's a PEA issue! After deoptimization several registers are uninitialized (thus NULL). With PEA disabled the segfault goes away.

[07:47] <nine> Yes, this should not happen: PEA: OPT: eliminated an allocation of Capture into r14(7)

[07:51] <MasterDuke> wow, that's the first pea bug i can remember in...forever?

[07:56] <nine> Well for one, no one's told PEA about MVM_SPESH_ANN_DEOPT_PRE_INS annotations yet. But that alone doesn't seem to be it

[20:24] <Geth> Â¦ tap-harness6: Drastically slows down compilation as it recompiles the library for every mention of it in the provides section. It only needs to compile it once.
