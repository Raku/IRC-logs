[10:38] <bartolin> since geth is still on vacation: I've just https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4195. It brings a small change to the Makefile (order of directories for Rakudo's 'make test'). I'm optimistic this won't break anything, but in case it does please let me know (or revert).

[18:37] <Xliff> \o

[18:37] <tellable6> 2021-02-06T13:05:11Z #raku-dev <moritz> xliff you can simply have the handler be a function, and call that in two routes: get -> '' { your_handler() }; get -> 'this', 'month' { your_handler };

[18:37] <tellable6> 2021-02-06T13:05:41Z #raku-dev <moritz> Xliff maybe you can also use a junction for the path, haven't tried that though

[18:37] <Xliff> moritz++ # tellable

[18:38] <Xliff> I'd like to seriously reopen the issue of getting large scale code installed.

[18:38] <Xliff> As per ugexe, this is not a zef issue, but a CURI one.

[18:38] <Xliff> The problem: Precompilation via CURI takes a long time. I'd like to be able to give the user more information (and use parallel precompiling) 

[18:39] <Xliff> Is this something that should be fixed/added to CURI or should something else be developed?

[18:39] <Xliff> Is this even the proper forum for such a discusson, or would #raku-dev or even problem-solving be a better place?

[18:40] <Xliff> ^^ lizmat jnthn ugexe moritz AlexDaniel jmerelo

[18:41] <lizmat> Xliff: you missed nine  in this list

[18:41] <Xliff> ^^ lizmat jnthn ugexe moritz AlexDaniel jmerelo nine

[18:42] <Xliff> lizmat++

[18:42] <lizmat> nine has been working on in-process pre-compilation, which should allow for a. faster precomp (no startup overhead per file being precomped) and would allow for more naturel hypering

[18:43] <lizmat> *natural

[18:43] <Xliff> lizmat: I know. I helped build the prototype for that. :)

[18:43] <lizmat> ok  :-)

[18:43] <Xliff> My issue is that there has to be a way to get CURI to use the new functionality.

[18:44] <Xliff> I don't know if CURI was ever developed with hooks to allow for a custom installation procedure.

[18:52] <lizmat> CURI isn't the hook, $*REPO is

[18:52] <lizmat> CURI is just *a* way to install modules

[18:53] <lizmat> Xliff: if it's about a production environment, perhaps *installing* precomp files could be a solution?

[18:55] <lizmat> if you want custom installation procedures, you need to develop your own CompUnit::Repository::Xliff module

[18:55] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[18:59] <Xliff> lizmat: Thanks for the suggestion. Are there any docs on how that would work. Looking forward to your answers when you get back.

[19:00] <Xliff> lizmat: For a production environment, I would expect to installing from pre-packaged binaries, ala deb, rpm, etc

[20:18] <Xliff> After a "rakudobrew build moar-blead", not getting this from a Cro project:

[20:20] <Xliff> Error while compiling /home/cbwood/Projects/CroCalendar/site#sources/E75E4286130FA3666E88CB52AE3CA0187776B692 (Cro::HTTP::Router::WebSocket)

[20:20] <Xliff> Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp' (from 'site#sources/C223DF36B97268CA54BFBCF1C7C6BCDB9B0B32EA (Crypt::Random)')

[20:21] <Xliff> Looks like something didn't recompile properly with latest rakudo  binary?

[20:22] <Xliff> As it is, I don't expect an error reporting core NQP files as a good thing.

[20:23] <Xliff> This is on: Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2020.12-122-g3f1607f8d.

[20:23] <Xliff> Implementing the Raku(tm) programming language v6.d.

[20:23] <Xliff> Built on MoarVM version 2020.12-98-gf6c505dae.

[20:23] <sena_kun> Xliff, do you work with rakubrew or rakudobrew?

[20:26] <Xliff> rakudobrew

[20:26] <Xliff> Isn't rakubrew the latest version of rakudobrew?

[20:27] <sena_kun> Xliff, yes, more of a rework, I think.

[20:27] <Xliff> FWIW, I've never had this problem with rakudobrew before. Smells like a build issue, but I reserve the right to be completely wrong.

[20:29] <sena_kun> Xliff, this is a build issue for sure, I am just not sure where you were before trying to update. I think there was a point in some months ago where one needs a rebuild (as in wipe and build) rather than an update&build, so possibly that would be it.

[20:30] <Xliff> *sigh*

[20:30] <Xliff> If the build error occured, it would have to be within the last week.

[20:30] <sena_kun> This is a sigh indeed. :(

[20:30] <Xliff> I rakudobrew weekly. Last time was 1/31

[20:31] <Xliff> Correction... 2/4

[20:31] <Xliff> Or 20210204

[20:31] <Xliff> ;)

[20:31] <sena_kun> I am sure lizmat can know more. I am in a real pinch here with building rakudo for last weeks, completely useless fellow.

[20:32] <Xliff> Not at all. BTW your tutorial on Cro::Webapp is what I am using to work on my Calendar project.

[20:32] <Xliff> Unfortunately, I can't test my latest changes due to above error.

[20:33] <sena_kun> Xliff, rakudobrew nuke moar-blead; rakudobrew build moar-blead?

[20:33] <Xliff> sena_kun: Unfortunately, that is an unacceptable solution.

[20:34] <Xliff> I mean, as an absolute last ditch thing, it's better to have a solution.

[20:34] <Xliff> But I have too much in modules invested in the current rakudobrew.

[20:34] <Xliff> As rakudo gets larger, that solution will become less acceptable over time.

[20:35] <Xliff> What was the problem that forced this issue?

[20:39] <Xliff> sena_kun: Also, it's odd this is happening only for Cro::WebApp

[20:39] <Xliff> I have yet to run into any issues recompiling my p6-GLib line

[20:40] <Xliff> I'm running my weekly builds of all 30-ish projects, and haven't run into this error.
