[07:24] <Xliff> Hello
[07:24] <Xliff> Getting this, now:
[07:24] <Xliff>  const_iX NYI
[07:24] <Xliff> This is following a segfault on a precompile.
[07:24] *** Xliff left
[07:44] <bartolin> nine, lizmat: Could it be that https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ae8fec579a also shouldn't have been a single (squashed) commit? (I've noticed the discussion about the new disp nativecall branch for MoarVM.)
[07:48] *** Xliff joined
[07:48] <Xliff> \o
[07:49] <Xliff> Here's a question: Are there any differences between JIT for AMD and Intel? I'm noticing stark differences in behavior between my Intel system and my AMD one, particularly after new-dispatch.
[07:50] *** Xliff left
[07:52] *** Xliff joined
[07:55] <nine> bartolin: yes it shouldn't have. lizmat++ reverted it and did a proper merge
[07:56] <bartolin> also for the rakudo merge?
[07:56] <nine> Oh, it happened there as well?
[07:56] <bartolin> I think so, yes
[07:57] <nine> Ah yes, then we need to fix it there as well
[07:57] <bartolin> oki. hopefully still easy-ish to fix.
[08:00] <bartolin> but on a related note: I noticed that a 'gmake install' blowed up on the JVM backend. (no registered operand handler for "nqp::dispatch('boot-syscall', ..."). It looks like that could be fixed by moving this line https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/5a6d1ee3a7/tools/build/install-core-dist.raku#L10 to the moar-specific key additions a bit below. Could that have some negative consequences for MoarVM?

[09:19] <lizmat> nine: nativecall newdisp now properly merged
[09:19] <nine> lizmat: I just did that?!
[09:19] <lizmat> then I'm not sure what I did  :-(
[09:20] * lizmat should have more tea in the morning -(
[09:25] <nine> I actually do not understand that git history anymore
[09:25] <lizmat> or maybe I'm just getting too old for this stuff  :-(
[09:25] <nine> But my fix for the JVM build issue definitely vanished
[09:25] <lizmat> :-(
[09:26] <lizmat> I was taking my cue from "[08:57:14]  <nine>	Ah yes, then we need to fix it there as well"
[09:26] <lizmat> and missed the "[10:01:05]  <nine>	That's the revert + branch merge with an amended last commit fixing the JVM issue"  :-(
[09:26] <nine> I also said that I was going to fix that, pushed a branch and said that this was the revert + proper merge
[09:27] <nine> And git must have told you that origin/master changed in the mean time?!
[09:27] <lizmat> no, it didn't
[09:27] <lizmat> well, Github didn't
[09:28] <nine> Ah, the JVM build fix is still there. I checked the wrong repo
[09:28] <lizmat> *phew*

[12:46] <frost> nine by my observation, after these operations, in /tools/build/install-core-dist.raku of the master of rakudo, %provides<NativeCall::Dispatcher> is always set to "lib/NativeCall/Dispatcher.rakumod", no matter on any backend, just like before you fix the jvm issue
[12:48] <frost> the fix seems to be reverted
[13:04] <jdv> is there any reason releases could be not on a saturday?  its the freakin weekend:)
[13:06] *** notable6 joined
[13:29] <nine> frost: oh, indeed! I only looked for the conditional adding. But the original unconditional one appeared as well
[13:29] <nine> I wonder if this is that one time where a force push to master might be an appropriate solution. I'd reset it to commit f67fb4ab2ea5f5714275644c0ca54c22cb6167bc
[13:29] <frost> nine++
[13:30] <nine> I'm not sure if that would make things worse though :)
[13:57] <lizmat> couldn't be worse than the mess I made of it :-(
[13:59] *** frost left
[14:01] <nine> Well, when you start digging...
[14:03] <nine>  ! [remote rejected]     master -> master (protected branch hook declined)
[14:05] <nine> Ok, disabled that protection and force pushed. Doesn't mean that it's over though. If someone who checked out master including the faulty commits pushes to master again, they will reappear
[14:06] <nine> Everyone: please reset your master branches to the current origin/master. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[14:07] *** samcv left
[14:07] <nine> lizmat: IIRC Ecosystem::Archive had issues? Are they still there? How can I reproduce?
[14:07] *** samcv joined
[14:07] <lizmat> the problem with Ecosystem::Archive are basically the same that prevent you from installing Cro::TLS 
[14:08] <lizmat> Cro::TLS testing hangs
[14:08] <lizmat> MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1  makes it work
[14:12] <[Coke]> please announce force push on #raku as well, we have a lot of people building from source. (if I read it right that it was rakudo)
[14:13] * lizmat checks out a fresh clone to be on the safe side
[14:13] <nine> Oh, cro-tls also succeeds with MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1. lizmat: is the same true for Ecosystem::Archive?
[14:13] *** Colt left
[14:13] <lizmat> yes
[14:14] <nine> Ok, so it's definitely not NativeCall as the expr jit can't cope with that
[14:15] <nine> I wonder why Cro-TLS didn't appear in the Blin output?
[14:15] <lizmat> well, maybe it's similar to the issue you found with that module that had a missing return signature ?
[14:16] <nine> No, then it wouldn't depend on the expr jit
