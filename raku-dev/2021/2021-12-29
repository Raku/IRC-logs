[00:08] <japhb> MasterDuke, lizmat: I don't think that's correct.  As moon-child pointed out earlier, ~& and +& are doing bitwise/ordwise operations, so it truly is ambiguous which parenthization is correct, and they aren't iffy (it just happens that +&'s result can be treated a zero/non-zero in boolean context).  ?& is legit iffy though.
