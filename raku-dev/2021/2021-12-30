[13:55] <carlmasak> greetings, #raku-dev. merry christmas

[13:56] <lizmat> carlmasak o/  long time no see!

[13:57] <carlmasak> masak: I wonder if you're... me. this is weird.

[13:57] <carlmasak> lizmat: indeed. I've lost my IRC habit for some reason, but not my taste for Perl and Raku

[13:58] <lizmat> good to hear!

[14:01] <carlmasak> camelia: say "do you still evaluate Raku code?"

[14:01] <carlmasak> m: say "or like this?"

[14:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 552edcb0b: OUTPUT: «or like this?␤»

[14:02] <carlmasak> oh!

[14:02] <carlmasak> I have a... wee bit of a lag going, though :D

[14:02] <lizmat> but then you're lightyears away!  :-)

[14:05] * carlmasak .oO( meanwhile, several ideologies to the East... )

[14:06] <carlmasak> lizmat: kathyz waves hi and wishes a merry season to you and wendy o/

[14:08] <carlmasak> m: say "roundtrip time..."

[14:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 552edcb0b: OUTPUT: «roundtrip time...␤»

[14:09] <carlmasak> ...18 seconds

[14:10] <carlmasak> which means I'm at _most_ 18 light-seconds away, actually

[14:14] * lizmat waves back at kathyz and the kid(s)  :-)

[14:14] <carlmasak> kid, singular -- but quite the one ;)

[14:14] <lizmat> well, it's been a while, and things.... happen :-)

[14:15] <carlmasak> haha

[14:17] <lizmat> going out for a bit, get some cycling in while it is still 15! degrees here

[14:17] <carlmasak> enjoy! hoping that `!` isn't a factorial :P

[14:17] <lizmat> warmest 30 Dec ever in NL, breaking the record from 1925

[14:18] <lizmat> carlmasak: perhaps https://logs.liz.nl/raku-dev/live.html is easier to read / backlog for you

[14:21] <carlmasak> lizmat: yes, so it seems! thank you.

[14:21] <lizmat> just scroll down for updates  :-)

[14:22] <lizmat> or up for backlogging
