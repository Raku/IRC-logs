[14:58] <[Coke]> .NET 6 makes me want to re-start that effort; have a bunch of time off for the holidays...

[14:59] <MasterDuke> that would be very cool

[15:00] <[Coke]> Is there anyone else who uses .NET at work where this would be helpful? I think that even if we had a .NET backend, I'd still have a hard time with adoption.

[15:01] <[Coke]> (I remember asking for JVM back in the day because we had a hard rule at work about having to run in a JVM, but that was *cough* pre-docker.

[15:45] <Voldenet> I use .net at work and I have hard time convincing C# people to do things in F# even when it makes sense to

[17:10] <jdv> i would imagine building out and supporting another runtime is way more work that it might seem

[17:11] <jdv> *than

[17:19] <[Coke]> It certainly is a lot of work, which is why the last time I thought about doing this, I didn't get much further than thinking about it. :)

[17:46] <lizmat> [Coke]: if you're looking for an interesting project, how about re-writing the grammar engine  :-)  

[17:54] <[Coke]> *eek*

[17:55] <jdv> ha

[18:03] <lizmat> although arguable writing a new backend should be simpler, as there are already 3 alternatives to steal from

[18:08] *** reportable6 left
[18:08] <jdv> yet only 1 of which has decent perf and/or feature completeness iirc

[18:08] *** reportable6 joined
[18:09] <lizmat> true

[18:09] <lizmat> but that definitely has not always been the case

[18:09] <lizmat> there was a time when the JVM had more features implemented than MoarVM!

[18:09] <jdv> oh yeah.  time flies;)

[18:23] *** casaca left
[18:23] <[Coke]> Nice thing about jvm/js/.net backends is you don't need to implement the VM!

[18:26] <lizmat> that has its pros and cons, e.g. wrt NFG, no ?

[18:27] <[Coke]> Sure, more nqp libs needed.

[18:28] <[Coke]> my phrasing there is awkward.
