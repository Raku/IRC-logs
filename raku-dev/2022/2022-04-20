[08:37] <CIAvash> I'm almost finished with a new syntax checker for Emacs, this time using flymake, called `flymake-rakudo`; Is it ok if I create the repository in Raku organization? `flycheck-raku` and other tools are already there.
[08:42] <MasterDuke> would it make sense to consolidate them into an emacs-tools repo (in the Raku org) or something like that?
[08:51] <CIAvash> let me first lookup "consolidate" ðŸ˜€ unify, merge. It kinda makes sense but they are not similar tools using similar libraries, there is also a little pain of changing the URL in melpa repository. Or can it be redirected? Also I haven't created a repo with multiple Emacs packages, so not sure how it works. Let's just say it's easier this way(at least for me) and clearer to users I think.

[08:54] <MasterDuke> sure, i don't use emacs so just wildly throwing ideas out there
[08:55] <CIAvash> These tools don't have to be on Raku org, but it makes it easier for others to contribute or take over if nobody is maintaining them
[09:03] <patrickb> + from me on putting things in the Raku org. I think that's how it's intended. Similar to RakuCommunityModules, but for non-module things. App-Rakubrew also lives there.

[14:49] <[Coke]> is there an overview somewhere of how fez works?
[14:49] <[Coke]> (Guessing the articles on the README page are where to look?)
[14:50] <[Coke]> the "there is no code but there are backups" scares me.
[14:52] <[Coke]> well, scare is overstating it. :)
[14:55] <[Coke]> doez fez require you to verify your email before uploading?
[14:56] <lizmat> you need to confirm the email
[14:56] <lizmat> and once a month you need to confirm your registration
[14:56] <lizmat> and yes.... that's why I built the REA  :-)
[14:56] <[Coke]> I just registered, no verification yet
[14:56] <lizmat> well, once of the reasons
[14:56] <lizmat> *one
