[18:40] <gfldex> &infix:<eq> is pure, so it can't hurt to short circuit.
[18:41] <gfldex> I found it in S03-metaops/reduce.t .
[18:42] <gfldex> That's an ENODOC tho.
[18:49] <sena_kun> that's an interesting case, but I suspect it's related to runtime optimizations interpreting the statistics rather than the construction short circuiting
[18:50] <sena_kun> the [&op] construction is pretty generic, so I'm not sure it should make a lot of assumptions about what's the op, is it pure, if it's result is a boolean etc.
