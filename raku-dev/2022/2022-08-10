[00:00] *** Kaipei is now known as Kaiepi

[00:00] <Kaiepi> !

[00:01] <Kaiepi> the loadbytecodefh op doesn't seem to help the jvm much atm, but adding it changes the size of the allocation that triggers the CORE.d.setting error from 559541 to 559553 on my machine

[14:28] <Kaiepi> the fix for Java/JavaRuntime imports on jvm-necromancy is kind of a hack: it only works because the exports are getting containerized

[14:28] <Kaiepi> without the containers, no symbol for whatever reason

[14:28] *** frost left
[14:30] <Kaiepi> there should already be a way around this though, just need to mess around a bit

[20:58] <Kaiepi> aha!

[20:59] <Kaiepi> t/03-jvm/01-interop.t breakage is just unrelated, recent breakage

[20:59] <Kaiepi> Perl6::Metamodel::JavaHOW.archetypes was missing its `$obj?`

[21:00] <Kaiepi> which gets overwritten by a symbol error in Perl6::Actions

[22:47] <vrurg> Kaiepi: it was my recent change to add the parameter to archetypes method. Looks like I missed it in JavaHOW.

[22:47] <vrurg> Kaiepi: just add an optional positional.
