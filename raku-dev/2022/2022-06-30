[19:07] <gfldex> lizmat: I'm asking because there is a request to teach the dicord bot to show per-server-nicks instead of the default username and don't want to cause confusion when names suddenly change. On IRC we get the nick-change-message, what would be missing on Discord.

[19:08] <gfldex> If that is no problem anyway, because the IRC logs don't care, I can go ahead with the requested change.

[19:08] <lizmat> well, irclogs.raku.org already knows about Discord... it removes the prefix already

[19:08] <gfldex> We have a CoC, what is causing me to worry.

[19:09] <lizmat> well, let's cross that bridge if it needs to be crossed

[19:09] <gfldex> good point

[19:09] <gfldex> fuck politics! let's code! \o/
