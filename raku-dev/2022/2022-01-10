[14:02] <nine> Am I the only one who sees spec test failures that look suspiciously like they may be cause by ^^^?
[15:11] <vrurg> nine: Perhaps.
[15:12] <vrurg> I'm re-building the master and will re-check. But what exactly fails?
[15:15] *** Altai-man left
[15:18] <vrurg> nine: no failures except for IO-Socket-Async.t which is always failing on my system, where no IPv6 is used.
[15:27] * lizmat runs a spectest
[15:36] <lizmat> nine: I only see t/spec/S12-construction/destruction.t  flap (test 6), and I've seen that more often in the past months
[17:49] <nine> Ok, must be something on my laptop. Can't reproduce the failures on my desktop either. Thanks for checking!
