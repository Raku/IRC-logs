[01:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: sorry the delay… but I want to use it to concert code to Red::AST, that way it will be much easier to convert something like: `Model.^all.grep: *.column eq “bla”`. Today we have many workarounds to do that…

[08:17] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: so if I understand correctly, you'd like to get to the inside of the *.column eq "bla" in your example

[08:18] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: yes... but that's just an example... the block could be much more complex...

[08:18] <lizmat> gotcha

[08:19] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: does that make sense?

[08:20] <lizmat> yes, it does  :-)

[08:20] <lizmat> basically you want a local version of a static optimizer for the block that you call the .grep with

[08:22] <SmokeMachine> not only for grep, but yes...

[08:22] <SmokeMachine> currently I have to do this bit workaround: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/ResultSeq.pm6#L141

[13:24] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: do you think that's possible?

[13:25] <lizmat> not 100% sure the ASTs will still be around by the time you get a Callable

[13:33] <SmokeMachine> if not, I'll probably need to create a custom compiler class to search for every method called on a model, track it and change it on `grep`s `maps, etc... possible?
