[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: Use FatRat for database Numeric values

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: 

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: Numeric is a database datatype which is known to be slow in order to preserve exact numbers. Raku should work in the same spirit when reading data from columns of that type (prefer correctness above speed).

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: 

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: The previous use of Rat would cause very long decimal values to be corrupted during the read process.

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: 

[00:00] <Geth> Â¦ DBIish/rbt.maintain-numeric-precision: Perhaps a more clever importer would use: my $*RAT-OVERFLOW = FatRat;

[17:31] <Kaiepi> when does INIT-time happen in the setting?

[17:59] <jdv> can someone bump?  looks like nqp isnt hitting moar current.

[18:00] <jdv> also can someone address https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/issues/387 ?

[20:38] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: review: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/2a12662824

[20:40] <lizmat> it does compile with a fresh checkout and immediate bump  :-(

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why is that sad?

[20:44] <lizmat> because it used to work on a non-fresh checkout, and now it doesn't

[20:44] <lizmat> aka a regression

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well at least it works _somehow_ ðŸ˜… I guess that's better than if it didn't work at all

[20:49] <lizmat> yeah, but it is *bloody* annoying, as it means I will need to re-install all of the ecosystem modules that I use

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, same happens when using rakubrew download, I think

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not to say that it isn't annoying ðŸ˜„
