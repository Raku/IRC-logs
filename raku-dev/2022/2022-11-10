[14:42] <[Coke]> there's a GH issue open saying "if we had tail call optimization, we'd have it." - kind of a soft RFE. Is it on the roadmap? Is there a roadmap?

[16:17] <ugexe> seems like that would ultimately depend on the backend

[16:17] <ugexe> for example: if java doesn't have TCO how could raku-j support TCO?

[16:19] <[Coke]> I think if we had an answer for moarvm, that would suffice.

[16:23] <vrurg> Probably, since its an optimization, it could be backend-dependant. We can't offer same optimizations everywhere, apparently.

[16:25] <vrurg> But I remember that Jonathan was opposing the idea. Don't remember why though.

[16:28] <[Coke]> Happy to just link to a blog post or something. :)

[16:29] <[Coke]> Maybe we can add it to a FAQ in the rakudo wiki.

[16:29] * [Coke] will ask in #moarvm
