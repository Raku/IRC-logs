[10:21] <patrickb> We currently don't provide compiled rakudo archives using musl on rakudo.org. This has the consequence that one can't use those on alpine. Alpine has quite up to date distro packages though.

[10:22] <patrickb> It's possible to use the archives from rakudo.org after installing the gcompat compatibility wrapper. I don't know how robust the resulting stack is. Also the comp wrapper adds roughly 50 MB.

[10:23] <patrickb> Quick poll: How high would you estimate the need for packages working on Alpine?

[10:25] <patrickb> Another datapoint: The missing musl archives mean that `rakubrew download` won't work on Alpine.

[19:04] <patrickb> [Coke]: I tried reproducing the rakuw.exe opens a terminal window, but shouldn't behavior. / rakuw.exe can print stuff to console but shouldn't be able. But I'm unable to. Any clues on how to reproduce?
