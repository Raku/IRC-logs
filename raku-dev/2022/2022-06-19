[12:50] <[Tux]> Is there an XLSX reader and writer for raku yet? Might be interesting scripts to convert

[12:50] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:jnthn/Spreadsheet::XLSX

[12:51] <lizmat> by jnthn / Edument

[12:51] <[Tux]> csv2xlsx and xlscat/xls2csv (also doing librefoffice, openoffice, csv, excel, squirrelcalc)

[12:52] <[Tux]> Nice! No time right now, but looks fancy

[12:52] <lizmat> still incomplete, but complete enough for $work
