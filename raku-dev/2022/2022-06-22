[11:02] <lizmat> m: Any = 42   # why isn't this a compile time error?

[11:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar d253dc79e: OUTPUT: «Cannot modify an immutable 'Any' type object␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:21] <Voldenet> m: class Any { method STORE(Int $x) { $x.say } }; Any = 42

[11:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar d253dc79e: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[11:21] <Voldenet> feels like debatable style

[11:55] <lizmat> yeah, but I guess that's a reason for not making it a compile time error

[12:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rakuast: role Foo { }; class Bar does Foo { };
