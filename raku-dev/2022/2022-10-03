[16:29] <hythm> nine: turns out the double dot in the library error comes from not having an extension in the library resource name. renaming `resource` to `resource.txt` fixed the issue. when not having extension, the content of the `resources` directory in the repo is ` 705D783E180D440A8BE0A0832525197FF9B9FF6C.` (there is a dot at the end), after renaming, the

[16:29] <hythm> content of the resources directory is `B9451E36E4627376B2116CDDB4EC9AD6CF4233A0.txt`

[16:36] <hythm> this means if i have a local library named "foo" then I need to add extension for it  e.g. `foo.so` to be recognized, I think.
