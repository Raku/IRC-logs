[13:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Feeds require .append to work, not .push

[13:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[13:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: This is probably a remnant from before the GLR, which then codified

[13:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the semantices of "push".  And those were not the ones needed for

[13:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: feeds: that was "append".

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make feed error message more comprehensible

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: As discussed in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5061 :

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:     % raku -e 'my @array[3,3] <== [0..8]'

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:     ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:     Cannot feed into shaped arrays, as one cannot '.append' to them.
