[11:42] <lizmat> I think there's something weird going on with module loading: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/8b55f762472165874ee2317086f5ee63

[11:43] <lizmat> in the first gist (after a re-compile of the setting) it strikes me that it tries to load the .repo-id from places it did *NOT* find the sha

[11:44] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/8b55f762472165874ee2317086f5ee63#file-load1-txt-L21-L23

[11:44] <lizmat> in the second case, it claims that the repo has changed and that it needs to re-check dependencies

[11:45] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/8b55f762472165874ee2317086f5ee63#file-load2-txt-L22-L29

[11:45] <lizmat> it does this *every* time

[11:46] <lizmat> which implies to me something's amiss and fixing this would help the time spectests take 

[11:46] <lizmat> (and testing in general)

[11:47] <lizmat> finally (probably related), https://gist.github.com/lizmat/8b55f762472165874ee2317086f5ee63#file-load2-txt-L30-L31 shows that it actually loads a *different* sha

[11:47] <lizmat> nine ugexe ^^

[11:47] <lizmat> vrurg ^^

[11:52] <nine> lizmat: trying to load .repo-id files from everywhere is perfectly normal. Maybe you're wondering what these files are in the first place?

[11:52] <lizmat> perhaps, indeed  :-)

[11:53] <lizmat> I mean, aren't they supposed to come in pairs, residing in the same dir ?

[11:54] <lizmat> the sha file, and the sha.repo-id file ?

[11:54] <nine> It's like this: you've got module A installed in site and have a precomp file for it in site/precomp. How do you know that the precomp file is up to date? On the one side we have to check whether the dependencies' precomp files have changed since. But even if not, what if there is a newer version of one of the dependencies in ~/.raku?

[11:54] <lizmat> but a precomp file can only change if the sha changes ?

[11:54] <lizmat> isn't the precomp file supposed to be immutable for a given sha ?

[11:55] <nine> So when we load a precomp file we have to look for any newer dependency in every repository of the repo chain. That's epensive, so what we do is we generate a SHA of all repositories' state and record that in the .repo-id files. If the SHA is still the same, we don't have to even check.

[11:56] <nine> So whenever you change the repository chain, by e.g. running with -Ilib, we have to check those dependencies again and if the precomp file is still up to date, we can put a .repo-id file into lib/.precomp/... and know through this that the precomp file from site is still ok

[11:57] <lizmat> ok, so .repo-sha would have been a better extension?  :-)

[11:58] <nine> Maybe. That would bake the implementation into the name. repo-id is about the identity of the repository chain (as in "is it identical to when we did the dependency check?")

[11:58] <nine> A bit of a mathy wording

[11:58] <lizmat> ok, gotcha   yeah

[11:59] <lizmat> so what about the changed dependencies ?

[11:59] <nine> That will need a closer look. Would be nice to find that there is a bug that we can fix to improve module loading performance

[13:15] <lizmat> nine: OOC, have you ever used the tools/install-dist.p6 script to install modules that have a "build" section?

[13:15] <lizmat> what I'm reading in the source atm, is that if it *has* a build, it will exit on successful bulding, and never actually run the install logic ?

[13:16] <lizmat> *building

[15:22] <ugexe> Inline::Perl5 uses it

[15:25] <ugexe> yeah looks like you would have to run it once with --build and once without

[15:26] <ugexe> i think the exit on success may not have been intentional though

[15:28] <ugexe> yeah that must be so, since build-only behavior would have its own path https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4c6c02789c9254aff14508f75d5bccfa1e014a03

[15:30] <ugexe> re changed dependencies, it wouldn't surprise me to find some module getting loaded that has `use lib ...`

[15:32] <ugexe> although from the output you posted that isnt the case

[16:01] *** committable6 joined
[16:03] *** sourceable6 joined
[16:11] <ugexe> looks like the behavior started between 2020.02.1 and 2020.07 (don't have 2020.05 build locally to test)

[16:11] <ugexe> the 2020.05 release has like 20 commits labeled as "CompUnit::* optimizations"

[16:12] <ugexe> if i were to guess it would be related to those
