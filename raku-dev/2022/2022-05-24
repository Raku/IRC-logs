[09:21] <Xliff_> japhb: No, this is after ddef64617. According to git, that commit was made on Saturday. I don't run timings until Sunday. These last were made fairly close to midnight.
[09:23] <Xliff_> Oddly enough, according to git, my version is 73b43e5f997

[09:23] <Xliff_> Which is weird, and definitely BEFORE ddef64617

[09:24] <Xliff_> At any rate, thanks japh. 
[09:24] <Xliff_> I'll rerun, later.

[12:21] <nine> Does anyone have a more elegant idea for implementing this? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/548ae0ac40fc9036b08bed7d731f5e9f5ebc79e7
[12:30] <lizmat> nine: my only thought would be hashes, but that would slow down parsing
[12:31] <nine> Yeah, hashes feel like overkill here.
[12:31] <lizmat> ah, maybe a .grep, but we don't have that in nqp, right ?
[12:31] <nine> no, we don't
[12:32] <lizmat> hmm... couldn't you push to @declarations directly in the for/if loop ?
[12:33] <nine> No, because I only know whether to push after processing the last parameter
[12:33] <nine> After all I need to ensure that none of them is the name I'm looking to push
[12:34] <lizmat> isn't it the most common case that all 3 need to be pushed ?
[12:34] <nine> yes it is, why?
[12:35] <lizmat> well, maybe just set up  @declarations with all 3, then in the loop, if you have a match, *remove* the corresponding one
[12:36] <nine> I think that would make the code even more cumbersome and not really faster
[12:36] <lizmat> would be for the common case ?
[12:37] <lizmat> you could at least move the flags into the if $!signature, and have an else that does an self.IMPL-WRAP-LIST( [$/,$!,$_] )
[12:39] <nine> That would be duplicating code (therefore enlarging bytecode size).
[12:39] <nine> Seems like this is just a case where there is no prettier solution and time is better spent on feature work.
[12:39] <lizmat> well, or something to be done later  :-)
[12:40] <nine> I'm sure there will be a ton of opportunities to micro optimize things in the RakuAST code :D
[12:41] <lizmat> probably  :-)

[14:51] <ggoebel> nine: micro-optimiztion... use elsif instead of consecutive if stmts in the for loop?
[14:55] <ggoebel> nine: shouldn't line 721 be $slash := 0 instead of $underscore?
[14:56] <nine> indeed!
[15:26] <ggoebel> nine: would it save bytecode to use a my $bitmask=7 and use xor to set whether slash, exclamation-mark, or underscore is present... instead of having separate $underscore, $slash, and $exclamation-mark?
[15:27] <nine> I don't know. But I'm pretty sure it wouldn't make the code more clear to read.
[15:28] <ggoebel> certainly less readable ...and premature optimization is the root of all evil
