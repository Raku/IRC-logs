[08:51] <timo> do we have a clue why liz' test-t came to an all-time low but tux' test-t was not faster than usual?

[08:51] <timo> i haven't even checked if there was a bump tho

[08:54] <lizmat> well, my test-t has always been lower than tux's: different hardware / OS

[08:56] <timo> i was thinking your change for leave-ish phasers would be, like, a percentual improvement thtat would translate to other hardware easily

[08:58] <lizmat> well... the leavish fixes I didn't expect much to do with test-t, tbh...

[08:59] <lizmat> Text::CSV only has one LEAVE phaser, and it is on the public method to ensure closing any file opened for reading

[08:59] <lizmat> I'd expect the std handles to be more of an improvement, in reduced startup time

[09:00] <lizmat> and there is one LEAVE phaser for every rakudo run, as part of a Lock.protect making sure all END phasers are run only once, instead of by multiple threads

[09:01] <lizmat> so I guess my leavish fixes meant 4 hash lookups less for test-t

[09:02] <timo> mhh okay i guess i kinda mixed stuff up a little bit :)
