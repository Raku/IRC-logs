[06:32] <Kaiepi> found out i can peek at the stack of a java process at any given point in time with jstack

[06:33] <Kaiepi> the backend gets stuck waiting for something or other to happen during a hang, but the stack is kinda big and has a bunch of ops w/ recent changes popping up

[06:34] <Kaiepi> sigh

[07:00] <releasable6> Next release in â‰ˆ2 days and â‰ˆ11 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[07:55] <nine_> meleyhik: FWIW I have the exact same problem as lizmat and vrurg: the tool's output is so noisy, it takes a lot of effort to find the little information. I much prefer it, when people just post the command/source code they use in a bug report and the command's output.

[08:04] *** nine_ is now known as nine

[18:12] <Kaiepi> fwiw, i think i have a way to get rid of Unsafe altogether from the jvm? still hangs at the final installation tho :(

[18:40] <Kaiepi> ah, it may be silencing errors in atomics while i've been mucking around with those

[19:18] <Kaiepi> YES

[19:18] <Kaiepi>     Installed 13 core modules in 97.579 seconds!

[19:18] <Kaiepi> +++ JVM BACKEND INSTALLED

[19:18] <Kaiepi> jvm is go on alpine

[19:18] <Kaiepi> + Unsafe is gone

[19:19] <Kaiepi> + nqp::barrierfull, so cas($ is rw, &code) is valid

[19:24] <patrickb> Whoop whoop!

[19:49] <vrurg> Kaiepi++++++++

[19:53] <japhb> Go Kaiepi!

[20:04] <[Coke]> wow, great job.

[20:52] <jdv> more fail:( - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5006

[20:53] <jdv> vrurg: ^ maybe some of yours?

[20:53] <jdv> lizmat: ^ maybe some of yours?

[20:55] <vrurg> jdv: do you know what they do to bad messengers? ;)

[20:57] <vrurg> jdv: at the first glance, something is weird. I do use LibXML and do it with the master. :/

[20:58] <jdv> i think i repro'd it at least once

[20:59] <jdv> yup, just again now

[21:11] <vrurg> jdv: it seems that the latest LibXML does fail, but the question is what happens. The installed module works for me.

[21:24] *** Altai-man left
[22:06] <lizmat> jdv: I'd be happy to revert that revert, but that would make other people unhappy again  :-(

[22:06] <lizmat> I'll look at the issue again after a night's sleep&

[22:49] <jdv> alright...:)
