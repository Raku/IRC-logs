[00:20] <lizmat> ok, I was thinking "raku -e 'Foo: ...'

[00:21] <lizmat> in any case, it should not be an IO object anyway...

[07:18] <nine> What would it be for artificially created labels (think RakuAST::Label.new)

[07:27] *** committable6 joined
[07:42] <lizmat> whatever you specify with the  creation of it ?

[07:42] <lizmat> Files=1351, Tests=117115, 291 wallclock secs (34.99 usr  9.49 sys + 4056.01 cusr 325.05 csys = 4425.54 CPU)

[08:02] <nine> Do you have to specify something?

[08:07] <nine> Currently RakuAST::Label doesn't even have file and line.

[08:12] *** reportable6 joined
[09:11] <lizmat> hmmm...

[09:13] <lizmat> could that be a NYI, or something else ?

[09:14] <lizmat> in any case, the file and line were exposed in Label.gist and/or Label.Str

[09:15] <lizmat> if they were an implementation detail, they shouldn't have been?

[09:15] <lizmat> for me, that was the reason for exposing them

[09:30] <nine> Are they spec tested?

[09:33] <nine> gist hasn't been changed since labels got introduced in 2014

[09:47] <lizmat> there are no spectests for Label, apart from it existing as a class

[10:08] *** linkable6 left
[10:08] *** evalable6 left
[10:08] <gfldex> There is always nqp::attr. So trying to hide stuff in CORE is largly futile.

[10:10] <gfldex> And that there are no spectests is hardly surprising. Nobody considered Label as a tool outside of the scope of the compiler itself. Having anything being an object comes at the price that the user can use them as such.

[10:13] <lizmat> gfldex: so you think I should revert?

[10:13] <gfldex> no

[10:13] <gfldex> My blogpost will explain. :)

[10:13] <lizmat> ok, just checking :-)

[12:28] <ugexe> it would seem a bit odd to find that there is not consensus to do this and there being a blog post suggesting it can be done

[12:29] <ugexe> i dont have an opinion on the label thing itself, just pointing out the optics of what i just read

[12:35] <lizmat> well, to me the eye opener was of using a Label as just that: a way to label a piece of code, not just for next / last

[12:37] <lizmat> m: sub bar($l) { dd $l }; FOO: bar FOO
