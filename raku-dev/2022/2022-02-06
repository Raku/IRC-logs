[11:21] <nine> 077AAD8E0: hi
[11:21] <077AAD8E0> what is going on with this channel (and others). my normal handle (tbrowder) has disappeared and now i have a random alias?
[11:21] <077AAD8E0> nine: hi
[11:22] <nine> Can't you just `/nick tbrowder`?
[11:22] <lizmat> 077AAD8E0: this feels like a client issue ?
[11:22] <077AAD8E0> maybe i've been cancelled
[11:23] <077AAD8E0> tried the nick but got msg the name is already in use. liz is probably correct...
[11:23] <moon-child> /msg nickserv ghost tbrowder?
[11:24] <077AAD8E0> hm, dat's too complex for me at moment, i'll check client

[19:55] <Voldenet> here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/2c0cc7/src/core.c/Distribution.pm6#L117
[19:56] <Voldenet> …I think
[20:06] <Xliff> Thanks!
[20:09] <Xliff> So is %?RESOURCES populated if running from a -I lib?
[20:10] <Xliff> If I install something and uninstall it, does that remove the META file as well? Is there any way I can check this?
[20:10] <Xliff> For the record, I had cro-webapp installed. Then I uninstalled it using `zef uninstall` to run it from a -I directory. Now the code that was once working no longer works.
[20:11] <Xliff> And I've traced it back to a %?RESOURCE reference that is now a null string.
[20:39] <Xliff> Is there a repository with the entire ecosystem in it?>
[20:39] <Xliff> ecosystem is just a huge METAlist
[20:39] <Xliff> And it is to JSON files, not repositories.
[20:45] <Voldenet> I'm not sure, I have not been using -I directly on module dir ever
[20:46] <Voldenet> > zef -to=inst#`pwd`/zef install . ; raku -Iinst#`pwd`/zef 
[20:46] <Voldenet> that's what I do to use modules in isolated manner
[20:48] <Voldenet> s/module dir/distribution dir/
[21:07] *** dogbert11 joined
[21:09] <Voldenet> So I've checked and I can't reproduce the problem with %?RESOURCE being null: http://ix.io/3OT3
