[16:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: lizmat++ created pull request #4987: Add IO::Path.under-version-control method in 6.e

[16:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4987

[16:36] <japhb> lizmat: Feels somewhat module-ish, as features go.

[16:36] <lizmat> I'll make it a module, for sure  :-)

[16:37] <lizmat> but also feels like a nice to have, now that things like git are ubiquitous

[16:37] <lizmat> note the name doesn't mention git: other version control systems could be added later

[16:37] <japhb> Also, may (or may not) be worth considering expanding to an inclusive list of such ... Debian's `etckeeper` has the most unbiased list of VCS that I know of.

[16:38] <japhb> Yup

[16:38] * japhb loves etckeeper -- don't need it often, but when I do, SO NICE.

[16:38] <lizmat> just seeing if people like it enough as it is, other functionality could be added later

[16:38] <japhb> nodnod

[16:39] <lizmat> going to use it for rak's --replace-files option

[16:39] <japhb> What is rak?  I've head my head down in other projects for a few days ....

[19:38] <Kaiepi> i'm really confused at how to implement a control exception

[19:38] <Kaiepi> because i have a CONTROL { $!($obj) if nqp::istype_nd($!, CX::Groan) }

[19:38] <Kaiepi>  in the wrapper for a punned dispatch, but it's complaining that there's no handler for whatever reason?

[19:39] <Kaiepi> (from nqp)

[20:08] <SmokeMachine> should it be inside a default?

[20:08] <Kaiepi> idt i have access to default here
