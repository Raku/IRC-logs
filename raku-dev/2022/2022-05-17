[14:46] <tellable6> 2022-05-16T06:19:30Z #raku-dev <MasterDuke> vrurg i can look, but i suspect bartolin is really the person to ask

[14:48] <vrurg> MasterDuke: ok, will ask him. Thanks!

[14:48] <vrurg> .ask bartolin Do you know why do I get 'java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: field_1' when use nqp::atomicbindattr/nqp::casattr and even just nqp::cas in the core?
