[10:56] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset

[10:56] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2022-05-23T10:56:04Z”

[11:10] <lizmat> hmmm.  I seem to be drawing a blank:

[11:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «"Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW"␤»

[11:11] <lizmat> that's weird: locally I get Perl6::Metamodel::PackageHOW ?

[11:12] <lizmat> m: dd Compiler.new.version

[11:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «v2022.03.80.g.530.e.17848␤»

[11:12] <lizmat> aha...  looks like camelia is stuck

[11:13] <lizmat> that should be v2022.04.74.g.1.c.4680544

[11:13] <lizmat> nine ^^ ??

[11:42] <nine> Ha! Even surpassed the requested specifications ;)

[11:58] <lizmat> hehe

[11:59] <lizmat> hmmm.. weird, I'm still seeing 74 locally?

[12:01] <MasterDuke> 75 here

[12:02] <lizmat> ok after a Configure

[12:02] <lizmat> m: use experimental; dd EXPORT::<will-complain>.HOW.^name

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 19c3bd180: OUTPUT: «"Perl6::Metamodel::PackageHOW"␤»

[12:02] <lizmat> right

[12:02] <lizmat> in order to get around what I describe in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4933

[12:03] <lizmat> I was thinking of manually importing symbols from the EXPORT::<will-complain> package

[12:03] <lizmat> but I appear to be drawing a blank on how to get to that trait_mod:<will> in there

[13:21] <vrurg> lizmat: ^ perhaps this would help?

[13:22] <lizmat> vrurg++  :-)

[13:22] <vrurg> lizmat: You could also look into Test::Async. I was fixing it just yesterdays to get rid of %REQUIRE_SYMBOLS.

[13:23] <lizmat> will do, finishing up the Weekly atm

[13:57] <[Coke]> lizmat: the meeting this weekend went fine, got at least one new volunteer, we'll set up a once a month meeting for the short term, scheduled TBA.

[13:58] <[Coke]> (for docs)

[13:58] <[Coke]> (4 people on the call)

[13:58] <[Coke]> in the meantime, have folks come to #raku-doc if they want to learn more/help out

[13:58] <[Coke]> who do we talk to about making raku-doc an official channel?

[14:17] * lizmat has no idea how that actually works

[15:22] <[Coke]> I asked in #libera for help - there's a raku group contact, they will have them reach out to me.

[18:27] <ggoebel> coke: I believe mst has historically wrangled the irc admin cats for raku channels, etc.

[18:28] <[Coke]> that was pre-libera

[18:28] <[Coke]> I'm all set, the contact already reached out.

[18:28] <[Coke]> and now they *know* they're the contact, so it should go smoother next time. :)
