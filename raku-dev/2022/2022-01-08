[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make set-env.sh script work on MacOS (#4704)

[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The script depends on the grep program and had a hard coded path that

[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: didn't match on MacOS. No need for an absolute path, so just remove.

[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[23:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fix suggested by sdondley.
