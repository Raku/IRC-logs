[11:09] <bartolin_> lizmat: re https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4732: I'm just waiting for the tests to finish. OOC, do you think that adding these calls to coerce_* has a relevant impact on performance? Or is it irrelevant, because the coercion has to be done under the hood anyway?

[14:28] <Xliff> p6-GLib Suite Timings for g2de6d63dd run on 2/20/2022 - 13193s

[14:28] <Xliff> This is, at this time, an over 2700 speed REDUCTION from last week!

[14:29] <MasterDuke> nice

[14:30] <Xliff> Last week's timing was 15990s (gfafcca315)-- that number is unusually high so I may rerun them.

[14:32] <MasterDuke> lizmat: btw, i don't believe those explicit nqp::coerce_ns are needed. i think the compiler puts them in for you if you do something like `my num $a = my str $b = "123"`

[14:37] <MasterDuke> hm

[14:38] <nine> Shouldn't we fix the JVM's QAST compiler then?

[14:39] <lizmat> nine, well yes: but not many people can do that, and I wanted to unbreak the JVM testing

[14:40] <lizmat> I'll gladly revert those changes to .unique/.repeated once the JVM backend is up-to-date

[14:41] <lizmat> and since it's in generated code, the change would only need to be done once, basically

[14:44] <Xliff> This reminds me. This is the 37th week for bug #4655, which is preventing parallel timings. Has there been any progress?>
