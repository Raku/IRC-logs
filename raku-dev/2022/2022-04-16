[07:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-CompUnit-Repository-Perl5: even borked before.  The version matcher should be ignored completely

[07:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-CompUnit-Repository-Perl5: **only** if the value is *exactly* True, so use =:= instead.

[08:00] <nine> lizmat: ^^^ it at least worked

[08:02] <lizmat> Ok, I was a bit too extreme in that message

[08:03] <lizmat> thing is, when we're working with matcher, it's always the =:= True that we use for testing whether the matcher can be ignored

[08:04] <lizmat> I'll make sure it won't be like that in any merge message :-)

[17:43] <AlexDaniel> (yes, from yesterday, but otherwise all good)

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> .tell lizmat I think tellable is back up (with all the messages, nothing was lost from what I can tell)

[17:44] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> .tell lizmat there is a chance that it will redeliver some messages that were already delivered, but based on what I see it's all good

[17:44] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> .tell lizmat btw now with IRC-logs we can make quotable work again, which is really cool
