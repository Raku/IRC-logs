[07:07] <Xliff> lizmat: The gist of it? Take a sub or method callable and do "my $tree = &callable.ast" -- Then perform analysis, introspection and modifications as necessary. If modifications are done, create a new callable from the changed AST.

[07:07] <Xliff> japhb: It wouald be great for Red. It would be huge for my projects as well. However, I would settle for workable macros.

[07:08] <Xliff> Also a way to make this possible in nativecall: "int (*function_ptr) (char *param1, Struct *param2)"

[07:09] <Xliff> Rather: "typedef int (*function_ptr) (char *param1, Struct *param2) MyParamTypeForFunctionPointer"

[07:09] <Xliff> And then use MyParamTypeForFunctionPointer in signatures.

[14:30] *** Kaipei is now known as Kaiepi

[14:32] <Kaiepi> o/

[14:33] <Kaiepi> touching generics led to me falling down the role rabbit hole again, but in reverse this time around

[14:33] <Kaiepi> which makes things a little easier

[14:34] <Kaiepi> i know that, generally, lists in the MOP need to be HLLized in order to be iterated. i'm wondering if there are certain lists that would be better off staying a deconted VMArray, e.g. mro and role_typecheck_list

[14:35] <Kaiepi> the RTL's handling would need changes in order to be like that though
