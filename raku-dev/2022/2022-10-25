[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Add rotor-like capability to Str.comb

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: By specifying a Pair with size and step, similar to List.rotor.

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: E.g., to generate trigrams of a string, use .comb(3 => -2):

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:    say "abcdef".comb(3 => -2); # abc bcd cde def

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[20:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Takes an optional :partial flag to also generate partial substrings

[20:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: (less than the specified size):

[20:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[20:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:    say "abcde".comb(3 => -2, :partial); # abc bcd cde de e
