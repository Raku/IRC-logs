[08:07] <lizmat> that's a *lot* more than yesterday...  also in CPU

[08:13] <lizmat> Files=1353, Tests=117193, 299 wallclock secs (41.39 usr 11.52 sys + 4116.20 cusr 347.13 csys = 4516.24 CPU)

[08:19] <MasterDuke> is the 299 from yesterday, or another run today?

[08:22] <lizmat> another run, on a cold machine right now

[08:22] <lizmat> I suspect 83ea647498961e7154241d317daa0b90929d9597

[08:22] <lizmat> as it may cause a lot more caching

[08:25] <nine> I wonder if that commit is really a desired change in the first place.

[08:26] <lizmat> well, it fixes an issue...  :-)

[08:26] <nine> Does it really?

[08:26] <MasterDuke> fwiw, just ran a spectest on my machine and time is same as before that commit

[08:30] <nine> The comment explaining PositionalBindFailover explicitly names "@-sigilled thing": https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Sequence.pm6#L14

[08:30] <nine> List $a is not an @-sigilled argument

[08:33] <lizmat> MasterDuke: can't run a proper comparison atm, machine is already no longer cold

[08:33] <lizmat> Files=1353, Tests=117193, 305 wallclock secs (42.36 usr 12.43 sys + 4217.63 cusr 352.83 csys = 4625.25 CPU)

[08:44] *** frost joined
[08:47] <nine> I get Files=1353, Tests=117193, 113 wallclock secs (22.24 usr  4.03 sys + 3115.77 cusr 185.06 csys = 3327.10 CPU) on master

[08:48] <nine> I get Files=1353, Tests=117193, 114 wallclock secs (22.58 usr  3.98 sys + 3114.81 cusr 185.15 csys = 3326.52 CPU) with 83ea647498961e7154241d317daa0b90929d9597 reverted

[08:48] <nine> So very much within margin of error

[09:09] <Geth> ¦ roast: Add test for #4911

[09:09] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/870cad69a4

[09:18] <MasterDuke> looks like there might be some more missing `:setting-only`

[09:18] <MasterDuke> m: my $a = "lakjsdf"; my $sd = $a ~~ tr/"abc"/"123"/; say +$sd

[09:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[09:18] <MasterDuke> m: my class StrDistance {}; my $a = "lakjsdf"; my $sd = $a ~~ tr/"abc"/"123"/; say +$sd

[09:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller Numeric(StrDistance:D: ); none of these signatures matches:␤    (Mu:U \v: *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:20] <MasterDuke> and a bunch of them could probably instead be `find_single_symbol_in_setting()`

[09:36] <MasterDuke> m: constant \f .= new; dd f

[09:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Mu.new␤»

[09:36] <MasterDuke> m: my class Mu {}; constant \f .= new; dd f

[09:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤An exception occurred while evaluating a constant␤at <tmp>:1␤Exception details:␤  No such method 'new' for invocant of type 'Mu'␤    in block  at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:37] <lizmat> fwiw, I feel this is getting close to DIHWIDT territory

[09:40] <MasterDuke> sure, but they're easy fixes (and potentially a micro-optimization at the same time)

[10:06] <lizmat> MasterDuke: go for it!
