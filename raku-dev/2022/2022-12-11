[00:50] <vrurg> [Coke]: are you around yet?
[00:54] <vrurg> Turns out I cannot change the settings of Rakudo repository. Can't set the primary branch to main.

[01:52] <vrurg> Just in case. I don't see a specific 'disable force pushes' in branch rules. But hope that 
[01:53] <vrurg> 'Do not allow bypassing the above settings' makes this a default, considering a specific 'Allow force pushes' settings at the end.
[02:02] <[Coke]> vrurg: hello
[02:03] <vrurg> [Coke]: hi. :) Nevermind, all solved. I thought you have admin in Rakudo repo, but jnthn has fixed this for me already.

[23:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how can community modules be released?
[23:13] <vrurg> MasterDuke: ok, got it. Of course it fails if you play with NQP from the main. ;) Now instead of incorporating the changes into Rakudo and teching Backtrace the new rules I lost time tracking down what could be wrong about the test, because mine NQP was the same! ;)
