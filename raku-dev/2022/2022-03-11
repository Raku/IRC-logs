[11:57] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: - new generator script, simplified data structures

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: Fix issue with linked timezones in "backward"

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: 

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: The "backward" file broke the idea of being able to generate and

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: update per timezone data file, because it mentions linked timezones

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: that do not actually occur in that timezone file.  And because of

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: that, all linked timezones in "backward" had disappeared.  So now

[13:19] <Geth> ¦ DateTime-TimeZone/main: we have 594 supported timezone files (119 more than before).
