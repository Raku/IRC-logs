[18:15] <lizmat> jdv: it was nerve wrecking (had never done any kind of repair on such a compact notebook before)

[18:15] <lizmat> and I only made one mistake putting it back together again, which was "easily" fixed by taking things apart again for a bit  :-)

[18:16] <lizmat> all 4 batteries of the battery pack had swollen to about 2x their original size

[18:16] <lizmat> and I felt a bit like I was part of a bomb deposal squad

[18:19] <lizmat> these were basically the steps that I did: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2019+Battery+Replacement/124182

[18:20] <lizmat> It took me about 4 hours...but then I took some breaks inbetween...

[18:20] <lizmat> those are pretty small screws for my ancient eyes  :-)

[18:26] <lizmat> dogbert17: the M1 MacMini is to stay, I will do all my Raku dev work on that from now on

[18:26] <lizmat> I think part of the reason for the battery issue, is the number of spectests that I have done on this, all at full blast

[18:28] <lizmat> jdv: after this exercise (which I gave myself only 20% of being fully successful) I was pretty tired (mentally mostly), so I went out to get some fresh air while cycling

[18:54] <vrurg> lizmat: Normally batteries suffer when are permanently kept on charge with 100%. But the last two major versions of macos got this under control. So, I lost three macbooks due to the issue, but the last one shows no sign of it.

[18:55] <lizmat> well, that could also be a reason, as I'm still on Mojave on this notebook

[18:55] <lizmat> as that is the last version that supports iPhoto, and I have still been unable to migrate it to Photos  :-(

[19:24] <vrurg> Wow, I had the bravery to do it long time ago. Wonder if it's still possible to migrate. They may not recognize the library format anymore.

[19:24] <lizmat> well, they *claim* to still support it...  it's just that the migration program just stalls after about 2 days  :-(

[19:25] <lizmat> anyways, is it just me, or is make spectest and make test not clean on  HEAD ?
