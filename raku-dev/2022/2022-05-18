[06:56] <SmokeMachine> Would it make sense/be possible to on a custom compiler pass to go to each map/grep/first block that is not running on a “just declared Positional” and converts its RakuAST to RedAST, create a new block with it and store it into a property inside the original block, and then when it would work as it always does on original methods but on Red’s methods it would get the new property from the block and use that instead of 

[06:56] <SmokeMachine> the original block. Would that make sense?
