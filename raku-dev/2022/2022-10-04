[14:48] <[Coke]> jdv: Is there a ticket or a gist showing the issues you faced with Blin?
[14:49] <[Coke]> and: Does anyone else have Blin installed somewhere where they can run the tests if needed? (I will revisit my linux VM after work today to see)
[14:59] <vrurg> [Coke]: I have it locally, but haven't ran for a long while. Not sure if it would start right away.

[15:01] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[15:14] <vrurg> [Coke]: on master I get a symbol merge error with Whaterable (duplicate SSL symbol). With ./docker/dblin it fails with 'Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.'
[15:15] <vrurg> That's as much as I have time for at the moment.
[15:16] *** Kaipei is now known as Kaiepi
[15:37] <[Coke]> (duplicate SSL symbol) yup, faced a similar issue trying to use Whateverable here.
[15:38] <[Coke]> I had been trying to install it, not run it standalone (which was later guidance); if you're getting the same issue standalone...
[15:42] <jdv> no.  there's a lot.
[15:42] <jdv> i still haven't gotten around to slogging more into it.
[15:43] <jdv> i run it in a docker container that i built last year i think
[15:46] <jdv> i may finally be able to get around to it again in the coming days.  the last few months - that has not been the case

[16:07] <[Coke]__> vrurg: https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/issues/386 - if you're getting a similar error running out of a git clone, can you add a note there?
[16:07] *** [Coke]__ is now known as [Coke]
[16:09] <jdv> that error doesn't look familiar to me
[16:09] <jdv> i'll put a gist together by EOD

[18:19] <[Coke]> so, looks like you're further than I am, but stuck on something else.
[18:20] <[Coke]> (I am trying to get a new install of Blin working, not the docker image)
[18:23] <jdv> multiple fronts.  i like it.  but i run the docker one.
[18:24] <jdv> probably mutually beneficiary-ish:)
[18:26] <[Coke]> oh - your issue seems to be that the perl6's built by whateverable aren't runnable on the latest linux variant?
[18:27] <jdv> thats the motivating issue, yes.
[18:27] <jdv> otherwise we'd have a aug release
[18:30] <jdv> to clarify, the perl6s built by whateverable arent runnable on debian buster (the docker images current os)
[18:32] <jdv> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile#L6
[18:35] <[Coke]> so maybe the fix is as simple as changing the OS the docker container uses as a base?
[18:36] <jdv> thats where i ran out of time doing:)
[18:37] <jdv> but deps change...  bitrot...  
[18:40] <jdv> but yes.  the idea was to try to get the blin docker image built on debian bookworm and hopefully be in a better position to go forward from there.
[18:40] <jdv> thats all i got so far;)
[18:42] <lizmat> could there be a reason why Blin would not work on MacOS ?
[18:42] <jdv> i dont know
[18:44] <lizmat> ok, good enough for me, I guess
[18:45] <jdv> i only have linux available to me:(
[18:45] <jdv> wut issue do u experience?
[18:45] <lizmat> Nothing yet
[18:46] <lizmat> I just realized I have a MacMini with stlll ~390GB disk space 
[18:46] <lizmat> would that be enough 
[18:46] <lizmat> ?
[18:47] <jdv> for wut then?
[18:57] *** sena_kun left
[18:59] *** sena_kun joined
[19:40] <[Coke]> lizmat: my hope is I can get it running on this azure VM and then fire it up as needed. (but getting running in docker on mac sounds great too)
[19:41] <lizmat> I guess I' old fashioned wanting this to run on actual metal ?
[19:49] * jdv looks around in astoundment
[19:50] <jdv> if we can just get a decent run ill be happier
[19:51] <jdv> no release til bil'lyn...!
[19:52] <jdv> i used to live in brooklyn:)
[19:53] <jdv> *blin',lyn
[19:53] * jdv cant type
[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do y'all know what's so special about negative numbers? they aren't a part of tokens <value>, <number> and <numish> in Raku grammar
[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's why they fail in signature returns, for example
[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's the rationale behind that?
[20:30] <vrurg> [Coke]: I was installing dependencies, so it's not a standalone case either.
