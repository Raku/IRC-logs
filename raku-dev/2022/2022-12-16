[22:05] <Nemokosch> The way properties are implemented is anything but relieving.

[22:07] <Nemokosch> Honestly, I don't know where this stuff is implemented - perhaps in the metamodel

[22:08] <Nemokosch> apparently, when you write `has @.lol`, you create a `@!lol` attribute - so far so good, right?

[22:08] <MasterDuke> BUILDPLAN i believe

[22:08] <Nemokosch> but nothing remotely like `@.lol` is created, to the extent that 1. you can write any sigil at occurances in the code and that will never be a lookup error

[22:09] <Nemokosch> 2. `@.lol` is apparently not even the same as `self.lol` and the latter does the right thing

[22:09] <Nemokosch> By the behavior, I would guess the former actually does `@(self.lol)`

[22:19] <Nemokosch> MasterDuke: thank you for the hint - I couldn't find it yet but at least I'm now aware that there is something like this :)

[22:20] <Nemokosch> also, I'm more and more convinced that @.lol just does @(self.lol) which is acceptable most of the time but not for native arrays

[22:23] <MasterDuke> you might be right, the output of --target=ast looks like that is happening

[22:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I kinda hope it's somewhere in Attribute.pm6 because I'm fairly clueless at this point
