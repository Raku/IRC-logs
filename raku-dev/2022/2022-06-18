[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: 

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: This changes the behaviour of .hyper/.race when given an undefined

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: value for :batch / :degree.  Before, this was an error.  With this

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: commit, it will assume the default values.

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: 

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: This makes it much easier to let e.g. CLI's manage defaults for

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: :degree and :batch, without needing to know what the defaults

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: actually are.  Just accept --degree and --batch without default

[09:29] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-hyper-defaults: values, and pass them on.
