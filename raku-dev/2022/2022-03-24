[10:22] <lizmat> MasterDuke: looks like the YAMLish failure happens after merging #4807

[10:23] <lizmat> "Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value" at Str.pm6 line 1815

[10:24] <MasterDuke> ha, guess that `try` was needed. what's the YAMLish code doing that causes that?

[10:28] <lizmat> argh, I just removed that...

[10:28] <MasterDuke> ?

[10:29] <lizmat> basically, you need to run the test with --ll-exception *and* disable the CATCH in load-parse

[10:29] <lizmat> s/load-parse/load-yaml

[10:36] <MasterDuke> well, jnthn did suggest testing with a substitution in an action method, guess my example that worked wasn't good enough

[10:39] <lizmat> I don't think YAMLish uses separate actions?

[10:39] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Leont/yamlish/blob/master/lib/YAMLish.pm6#L500

[10:40] <MasterDuke> adding back the `try`s fixes the YAMLish test, i'll PR that in a minute

[10:43] * lizmat stands corrected :-)

[10:43] <lizmat> but isn't that just covering up the issue ?

[10:45] <MasterDuke> well, maybe your suggestion of changing to `if nqp::iscont(cds)` is better

[10:45] <MasterDuke> i'll give that a try

[10:49] <MasterDuke> nope

[10:50] <MasterDuke> same error in YAMLish test

[10:53] <MasterDuke> ah, but looks like maybe `if nqp::isrwcont(cds)` does the trick

[10:57] <lizmat> interesting... I always assumed that nqp::iscont implied assignabiluty... guess we need to look at more places that check like that

[11:00] <MasterDuke> this will be the only use of isrwcont in the src/core.*

[11:00] <MasterDuke> only a couple other uses elsewhere

[11:06] <leont> YAML has a habit of exposing weird issues by virtue of being a far more complicated grammar than most

[11:46] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: MasterDuke17++ created pull request #4830: Only assign to caller's $/ during a regex subsititution if it's writable

[11:46] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4830

[11:56] <lizmat> MasterDuke: looks like e.g. TEMP-LET-LOCALIZE is also using iscont incorrectly (line 441 in Hash.p6)

[11:56] <lizmat> Proc::Async!pipe and !wrap-decoder

[11:57] <lizmat> Regex.ACCEPTS

[11:58] <lizmat> Hash::Object.TEMP-LET-LOCALIZE

[11:59] <lizmat> Map.ASSIGN-KEY

[11:59] <lizmat> MasterDuke: maybe I should just do all of them myself ?  :-)

[12:00] <MasterDuke> i'm going to be afk for a while, won't stop you

[12:02] <lizmat> ok, will do
