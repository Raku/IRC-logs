[00:11] <[Coke]> m: say "\c[VERTICAL ELLIPSIS]"

[00:16] <japhb> $ u ellipsis |wc -l

[00:16] <japhb> 8

[00:16] <japhb> Somewhat boggling.

[00:18] <japhb> Not least because HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS and VERTICAL ELLIPSIS for some reason have different Unicode categories, and PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS chooses the category for a HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS while actually *being* vertical.

[19:20] <sena_kun> Xliff, hi! I'm a bit out of the loop, I don't think it's in main or is it?

[19:46] <Xliff1> sena_kun: The parallel compilation has been in main for a while, now. 

[19:48] <sena_kun> Xliff1, ah, I see. I remember it was in development for some time, but didn't follow the merge then. :)

[19:50] <drakonis> lizmat: the title of the block regarding visual studio code support is still missing code in it

[19:50] <drakonis> lol
