[03:04] <jdv> lizmat: thanks

[03:04] <jdv> is there a recording or other materials from the class thing earlier?

[03:04] <jdv> vrurg: ^

[03:06] <vrurg> jdv: I was streaming to youtube, but the quality of it happened to be way below my expectations. :( Turns out jitsi failed to maintain it.

[03:06] <vrurg> Besides, due to weird disconnections the last ~10-15 minutes are lost completely.

[03:06] * vrurg is considering re-recording it just as a presentation.

[03:24] <jdv> i got the timing wrong but i was gonna tune in.  ok.

[19:40] <lizmat> jdv did I miss the NQP release ?

[19:41] <jdv> no, why do you ask?

[19:43] <jdv> the rakudo release branch has to be pushed earlier on than the release guide implies - i imagine that's what you're referencing

[19:43] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[19:44] <lizmat> I guess  :-)

[19:44] <jdv> yeah, its in some notes i keep meaning to merge in but haven't gotten round to it yet...

[21:28] <patrickb> I will try to do the binaries tomorrow evening (UTC+1). I can't guarantee for the MacOS archives though as I sold my Mac mini and need to set up the pipeline on MacStadium first.
