[10:07] <lizmat> I think the latter semantics are actually wrong

[10:08] <lizmat> in the case of >>.ord, we get a modified array, and the original is unchanged

[10:08] <lizmat> in the case of >>--, we get a copy of the original array, and the original array is modified

[10:09] <lizmat> that is inconsistent

[10:13] <lizmat> but I guess it is consistent with the current documentation: "This is the hyper method call operator. Will call a method on all elements of a List out of order and return the list of return values in order."
