[12:34] <lizmat> this is unexpected: on the new MacMini M1, parse time of Rakudo down from ~50 to about ~30

[12:34] <lizmat> spectest down from ~290 seconds to ~180

[12:34] <lizmat> with only 4+4 cores as opposed to 8+8 cores on my MBP

[12:35] <lizmat> quite amazing!

[16:45] <lizmat> dogbert17: well, sort of....  my current MBP at least needs a new battery, the current one is near spontaneous combustion

[16:45] <lizmat> and a new MBP to my specs would at least take until August for delivery

[16:45] <lizmat> so I got myself a MacMini with an M1 chip in the interim

[16:46] <lizmat> I'm not travelling much these days, so a MacMini will do fine for now
