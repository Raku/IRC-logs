[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Allow Dateish *day* parameter to be a Callable / Whatever (#4808)

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: When creating a Date or DateTime object, you sometimes want to

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: specify the day from the end of the month in the given year.

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: You can do that now by for x, similar to end-of-array indexing:

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:     my $date = Date.today;

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: <…commit message has 14 more lines…>

[16:07] <[Coke]> are we consistent with * vs. *-1 when referring to the last thing?

[16:10] <ugexe> when does * mean the last thing?

[16:13] <lizmat> with array indexing, it means the number of elements, but arrays are 0-based

[16:13] <lizmat> in Date.new(year,month, *), it also means the number of days in a month

[16:13] <lizmat> but days are 1-based

[16:22] <[Coke]> fair.

[20:29] <Xliff> nine: Since you fixed 4655, I haven't had good parallel compilation data.

[20:30] <Xliff> After the fix I needed to fix the parallel toolchain.

[20:30] <Xliff> Getting promising numbers now.

[20:30] <Xliff> Thanks for the fix. nine++
