[10:19] <Xliff> Arr mateys... it be Sunday. Timins'll be a bit late today since they just been staaahrted.

[10:20] <lizmat> arhhh  

[10:20] <tellable6> 2022-06-24T20:32:05Z #raku-dev <vrurg> lizmat looks like  R#4957 makes t/spec/S32-io/socket-recv-vs-read.t flap with failures be more likely. Reversal results in spectest passing twice with no failure.

[10:20] <Xliff> Also, added p6-ICal-GLib to the list of projects being timed, so I expect to see some form of increase from last week.

[10:21] <Xliff> Looked into attempting raku bindings for Unreal Engine 5.... it turns out it might be a bit... daunting.

[10:21] *** linkable6 joined
[10:33] <Xliff> Just closed 4440!

[10:55] <lizmat> Xliff++

[10:58] <Xliff> Hmmm....

[10:58] <Xliff> GIO compunits are getting recompiled too many times.

[10:59] <Xliff> It only seems to be GIO, but GIO happens early, and yet later projects are recompiling them as if they weren't already precompiled.

[10:59] <Xliff> Aha! Errors.
