[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-nano: 

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-nano: Specifically did not include that for 6.c.  Unfortunately, it's pretty

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-nano: hard to add support in the grammar for a nano term in 6.e only, so

[09:22] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-nano: the older settings create a runtime error.  Suggestions for fixing this

[09:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[09:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Changed the name from "span" to "snip" because of slightly extended functionality from "span" because the condition can also be a List of conditions

[09:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: (in the sub case), or just have multiple conditions (in the method case).
