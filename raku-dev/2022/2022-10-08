[19:34] <bartolin_> lizmat: To me it looks a bit strange to assign -1 to uint all over the place. Does this bring a performance improvement?

[19:35] <lizmat> m: my uint $a = -1; say ++$a

[19:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 25c76aed0: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[19:35] <lizmat> I think that makes more sense than:

[19:36] <lizmat> m: my uint $a = 18446744073709551615; say ++$a

[19:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 25c76aed0: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[19:36] <bartolin_> yes, sure. but what was wrong with int in the first place?

[19:36] <lizmat> also: -1 will work on both 32bit and 64bit systems

[19:37] <lizmat> well, with uint we have 2x the range

[19:37] <bartolin_> ah, ok.

[19:37] <lizmat> but other than that, there are no performance reasons

[19:38] *** Altai-man left
[19:38] <bartolin_> I see. I just wondered why you did this. And I didn't think that the range could become a limiting factor. Thanks for explaining :)

[19:39] <lizmat> well, it would be extreme in the 64 bit case

[19:40] <lizmat> I mean, more than 9223372036854775807

[19:40] <lizmat> but yeah...

[19:40] <lizmat> in a way it's also dogfooding, making sure we got all native uint cases right

[19:41] *** linkable6 left
[19:41] <lizmat> there would be no problem reverting the last 2 commits should it become clear they break the ecosystem

[19:41] *** sena_kun joined
[19:42] *** linkable6 joined
[19:42] <lizmat> there's plenty of iterator logic that would also need be looked at wrt uint...  but am too tired for that now
