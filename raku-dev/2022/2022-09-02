[17:07] <AlexDaniel> does anybody have 2022.03 or earlier at hand?

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> my rakubrew is refusing to build for some reason…

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> a, fixed my rakubrew, nevermind!

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> it needed a self-upgrade for some reason

[17:14] <gfldex> is prefix temp thread safe?

[17:21] <timo> i would assume temp has the same semantics as an assignment + another assignment in a LEAVE phaser

[17:21] <timo> except i don't know how temp exactly works with arrays and hashes and whatnot

[17:33] <melezhik> AlexDaniel who now does support blin ?

[18:09] *** reportable6 joined
[18:24] <melezhik> I am not sure if everyone is satisfied with the time blin performs tests for entire  eco system, I have a POC how we can run blin in parallel hosts splitting the load and executing checks for different modules in parallel , this could significantly reduce overall time , however I am not sure if this us really needed ... 🤔

[18:30] <melezhik> us -> is

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: I'm sure it's maintained by the community, feel free to do anything: https://github.com/Raku/Blin

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> but ask the current release manager if any change is needed

[21:02] <melezhik> questions to Rakudo maintainers - could one run spec tests against Rakudo installed as whateverable ? does it make a sense ?

[21:02] <melezhik> I mean usually afik spec tests are meant to run when building Rakudo from source, right?

[21:03] <melezhik> what if one install spec test from Roast and run them against installed rakudo ?

[21:03] <melezhik> I am not sure this is a valid path ... though
