[15:38] <bartolin> MasterDuke: a while ago you approved https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4675. (thanks for looking!) Merging that PR would require a minor tweak to roast: https://github.com/Raku/roast/pull/777. Do you have an opinion about that change as well? (I think, it would be fine, since the test is just a bit more unspecific.)

[15:41] <bartolin> (btw, I'm guilty of having introduced the overly specific test for the error message. but still, this is technically a change to the language now)

[15:49] <MasterDuke> yeah, that seems like a reasonable change to me

[15:49] <MasterDuke> might want to ping jdv though, now that he's the release manager

[15:51] <bartolin> good point, will do (probably later) :)

[15:52] <Altai-man> IME such tweaks are considered fine

[15:55] <bartolin> Altai-man: thanks. btw, I'm inclined to cherry-pick the change to 6.c-errata, too

[15:56] <Altai-man> bartolin, sure, 6.d-errata too.

[15:57] <Altai-man> generally any changes to roast that make rakudo not pass roast on 6.c-errata or 6.d-errata must be backported.

[15:58] <Altai-man> For moarvm usually the release manager does the backporting, but for JVM it's also a good idea.
