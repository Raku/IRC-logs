[17:44] <jdv> AlexDaniel: was there a change on the whateverable build box or whatever?

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> jdv: maybe, maybe not

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> jdv: depends on what you mean

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> for example, when `gcc` is updated, this results in slightly different rakudo binaries

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> recently there was a debian release, and I believe that the system rolled over to it

[17:45] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/ffa82e105b75a90d3ff87804005a174b

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> I can give a more specific answer to a more specific question :)

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> alright, that's a bit concerning

[17:46] <jdv> that docker image has worked since december

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> but

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> e: say 42

[17:46] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar d059921b7: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> jdv: aaa, okay, your glibc is not new enough

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> any chance you can upgrade the image itself?

[17:47] <jdv> i just updated it in the container

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> this has been an issue for quite some time actually… rakudo must be built with an old enough glibc in order to be portable between the systems

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> I build stuff on debian, and it comes with whatever

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> so… hm

[17:48] <AlexDaniel> the build process should be dockerized of course to eliminate that issue

[17:48] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, it isn't, so that's where we are right now

[17:49] <jdv> looks like 2.28 is the most up to date for the image's os

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> bullseye comes with 2.31 and bookworm with 2.34

[17:50] <jdv> which is buster

[17:50] <jdv> cur-1

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> buster is 2019 release

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> and it's 2.28 on buster, yeah

[17:52] <jdv> i'll try rebuilding to bullseye

[17:52] <AlexDaniel> I'm a bit confused by that output… it looks for 3 different glibc versions, none of which is in bullseye 😂

[17:53] <jdv> i am largely ignorant of blin - its "just worked" for me so far.

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> well, looking at the current situation, it seems like upgrading to bullseye is not going to necessarily help

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> but… try it

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> it's an issue on my side actually, my glibc is even newer

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> I can try downgrading it, but it's a bit scary 😂

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> jdv: upgrading to debian testing is going to work for sure…

[18:07] <jdv> why is the build stuff running on testing?  seems a bit bleeding edge

[18:08] <AlexDaniel> good question… :)

[18:09] <jdv> where is nxadm - i can't get the image to build...

[18:14] <jdv> .seen nxadm

[18:14] <tellable6> jdv, I haven't seen nxadm around, did you mean nadim?

[18:15] <jdv> .seen El_Che

[18:15] <tellable6> jdv, I saw El_Che 2022-08-20T22:41:08Z in #raku: <El_Che> (just kidding)

[18:15] <jdv> .tell El_Che need help rebuilding the blin image on debian testing because https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jdv/ffa82e105b75a90d3ff87804005a174b/raw/c6cffe4195a580005fd4372a23bde2d9a78717a6/gistfile1.txt

[18:15] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[18:16] <jdv> note that the release may be delayed because of this - whoever is interested...:)
