[02:47] <jdv> iirc it was related to your changes

[02:53] <jdv> the reason for this:  https://github.com/FCO/Red/commit/bdd5bbdf8f8c4255bc9c74f0021886b9a726fb2a

[02:53] <jdv> vrurg: ^

[02:54] <jdv> SmokeMachine: do you know if thats fixed yet?

[02:56] <vrurg> I'm afraid, more input would be needed. Vaguely recall that there was an issue opened, wasn't it?

[02:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - The dispatcher itself never expects a containerized coercer, but it

[02:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:   was possible for the metamodel to bypass a container

[02:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - The scalar case of value was considerd, but `Proxy` has been

[02:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:   overlooked; if there be any other kind of container it should be

[02:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:   handled appropriately too

[15:08] <[Coke]> patrickb: if it was the behavior I reported, nothing has changed.

[15:11] <patrickb> [Coke]: How do you run `rakuw -e 'say 3'`?

[15:12] <patrickb> Typing that into a Windows Terminal Window on my end outputs nothing.

[19:05] <Voldenet> Other way to finish a program is to inject exit syscall to it

[19:27] <Kaiepi> apparently this is how you fence in java? https://openjdk.org/jeps/171
