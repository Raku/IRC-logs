[15:30] <MasterDuke> np, thanks for keeping up with the jvm backend

[17:04] <nine> bartolin_: I fear it's going to be a bit difficult to get the JVM correct with regards to int/uint as Java AFAIK doesn't have unsigned integers. So I don't know what we could actually do there?

[17:21] *** linkable6 joined
[17:28] *** timo joined
[17:48] <bartolin_> nine: I have no clear idea there as well. But for everything except int64|uint64 we could maybe store values signed (as long, int, etc) and adjust from signed to unsigned as needed when fetching the value. I'm pretty sure we do it that way in a few places already -- e.g. for VMArrayInstance_u32. "native" wouldn't be fully true, though ;)

[17:56] <nine> fake it till you make it ;)

[19:30] <MasterDuke> anyone know what other jvm languages (e.g., scala, kotlin, clojure, groovy) do? do they have unsigned natives?

[19:37] * bartolin_ doesn't know

[19:43] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/unsigned-types.md seems relevant, maybe something to steal from

[19:45] <MasterDuke> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#compareUnsigned-int-int- oh and it looks like the jvm does have some ability to work with numbers as unsigned as of version 8

[22:23] <[Coke]> inadvertently borked in september.

[22:31] <MasterDuke> are a bunch of them *_u versions? those are likely simple to add
