[19:33] <masukomi> Question: I'm debugging a problem i'm having in DB::SQLite (probably me being stupid) so i put a note("XXX SOME MESSAGE"); line.  I then zef uninstall DB::SQLite and zef install . ... all good, and I can confirm that the installed file has my note.... but even though i KNOW i'm in the method with the note, i never SEE the note, but i DO see notes from in my code that's calling it.   What gives? How do i make notes in a module
[19:33] <masukomi>  actually print to STDERR ? 
[19:38] <nine> masukomi: note in a module is totally fine. Sounds more like you're just not really using that module. Running with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 in your environment can shed some light.
[19:40] <masukomi> definitely using the module. I'm blowing up a few lines below my note, and my note's not in an if or anything.
[19:56] <masukomi> hmm... you may be right but the .... error message is wrong? /opt/homebrew/Cellar/rakudo-star/2022.07/share/perl6/site/sources/FF81D543D88B162772D20C1D6C6440917214D568 disappears when i zef uninstall. it reappears when i `zef install .` AND it has my stuff in it. BUT i can replace the method in question with `die("WTF")` and it compiles fine, it tests fine, it installs again, AND it complains about erroring on the same line
[19:56] <masukomi>  number which is now a) a comment and b) dozens of lines away from the method in question. 
[19:57] <masukomi> (the disappearing & reappearing file is the one it claims the error is happening in on a line number that's now wholly irrelevant)

[20:02] <gfldex> masukomi: did you try to nuke .precomp ?
[20:03] *** Kaipii left
[20:06] <masukomi> no. i didn't. Just tried, and ... i dunno something's gone very wrong ...which is a GOOD thing!!!  "Cannot look up attributes in a DB::SQLite::Native type object. Did you forget a '.new'?" I think that's related to some poking i did... so... I think that was ultimately my problem. ... will holler if that wasn't it. 
[20:06] <masukomi> Thank you gfldex 
[20:06] <gfldex> yw
[20:08] <gfldex> It can't hurt to use https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Repository::Precomp::Cleanup in tests.
[20:08] <nine> masukomi: have you actually tried RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG?
[20:09] <masukomi> yes. but i think my raku newbness resulted in it not being terribly useful. 
[20:09] <masukomi> like it wasn't meaningful to me
