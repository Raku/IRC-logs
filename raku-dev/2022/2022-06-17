[07:02] <[Tux]> lizmat, p5 was in search of tables-in-pod examples in raku: "Raku’s pod supports tables – how much is this capability used? I tried a quick search, but couldn’t find any documentation using tables (but I’m not familiar with the Raku ecosystem, so I could easily have missed a bunch)."

[07:02] <[Tux]> Can you find me an example that I can point to?

[13:00] <tbrowder> ref tables: there are LOTS of tables used in the docs. and check out “pod6 tables” in Language|General Reference

[13:03] <tbrowder> one of the major NYI parts of tables is lack of formatting inside table cells. i hop the new ast can ease that work for someone. (sub-tables would be cool, too)

[13:04] <tbrowder> *hope
