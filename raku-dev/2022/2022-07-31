[19:44] <jdv> I believe the release is complete:)

[19:45] <tellable6> jdv, I saw El_Che 2022-07-19T10:04:50Z in #raku: <El_Che> SmokeMachine: being pedanrtic about sub split-email { $^email.split("@")[1..*].tail } :)

[19:45] <jdv> .tell El_Che 2022.07 release happened

[19:45] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[19:49] * jdv will be afk for a bit

[20:10] <lizmat> jdv++

[20:27] <lizmat> and /me is back to not being able to build  :-(

[20:28] <lizmat> I hope I'm the only one

[20:33] <japhb> I can build Rakudo, but right now the module installs break.  Running the full rebuild to see if it dies in the same place again.

[20:37] <lizmat> looks like a clean checkout compiles ok

[20:37] <lizmat> but I don't want to nuke all of my installed modules :-(

[20:39] * lizmat gives up for today

[22:52] <japhb> Gah, failed in a different place (considerably later in the module installs, so at least the first one wasn't a hard failure  :-/ )
