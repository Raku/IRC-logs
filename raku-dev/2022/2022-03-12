[18:47] <jdv> it appears there's a hang issue with Cro::HTTP:(

[19:53] <[Coke]> Does the blin run give a bisect, or just note the failure?

[20:25] *** ShaneC joined
[20:30] <lizmat> it tries to bisect

[21:16] <jdv> not for that category, no - no bisect

[21:16] <jdv> it appears to be something like a 1 in 3 on at least one test - http-timeout.t
