[11:49] <jdv> lizmat: the rakudo channgelog is up

[11:50] <lizmat> ok, I'm looking at some tweaks, ok ?

[11:51] <jdv> also, i realized when i went to do the moarvm changelog that nqp and rakudo don't have bumps for most of hte new commits on moar

[11:51] <jdv> yeah, i'm thinking on attempting the release tomorrow

[11:51] <lizmat> yeah, they're lagging a bit

[11:51] <lizmat> want me to bump NQP and Rakudo before then ?

[11:52] <jdv> i guess that's a good idea.  i can do a blin later today and we can at least get some hours of "testing".

[11:53] <lizmat> oki will do

[11:53] <jdv> thanks

[11:54] <lizmat> Changelog updated

[11:54] <jdv> thanks

[12:14] <lizmat> jdv: meh, had to get a clean nqp checkout to get it to build  :-(

[12:14] <lizmat> same for rakudo... building and testing now

[12:19] <lizmat> jdv: seems Rakudo doesn't build after the NQP bump :-(

[12:22] <lizmat> looks like --gen-moar is borked

[12:22] <lizmat> looks like this is the cause: NQP::Config::run_or_die(ARRAY(0x1279da3a0)) called at /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/nqp/tools/lib/NQP/Config/NQP.pm line 352

[12:52] <jdv> uh oh

[12:56] <lizmat> yeah... something feels seriously amiss with MoarVM atm, at least for me

[12:57] <lizmat> I've nuked Rakudo 3 times now already

[12:57] <lizmat> % zef install Ecosystem::Archive::Update --/test

[12:57] <lizmat> zsh: segmentation fault  zef install Ecosystem::Archive::Update --/test

[12:57] <lizmat> *sigh*

[13:01] <lizmat> hmmm... starting to look like a local issue, as I get the same now on HEAD

[17:54] <jdv> did it pass locally?

[17:56] <jdv> yup, same commit bisected to and same test output.  weird.
