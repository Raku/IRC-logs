[16:35] <Kaiepi> convinced nqp to build without loading entire jars into memory all at once

[16:35] <Kaiepi> not sure if it helps build times yet, but does make the cpu a little happier

[16:37] <Kaiepi> same should be doable for classfiles, though sometimes those are nqp::loadbytecode'd in

[16:37] <Kaiepi> so there'd be less of an impact i imagine

[16:42] <Kaiepi> the cpu's able to keep busy with fewer pauses, but the build times are around the same for CORE.c.setting

[16:51] <Kaiepi> errrr

[16:51] <Kaiepi> loadbytecode loads bytecode

[16:51] <Kaiepi> derp

[16:53] <Kaiepi> nvm i was looking at deserialize, it's loadbytecodebuffer i'm thinking of

[16:53] <Kaiepi> which can do either classfiles or jars, so *shrug*

[16:55] <Kaiepi> just jars, it's loadbytecode that does either
