[18:30] <gfldex> vrurg_: as requested: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4992

[19:22] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[19:23] <vrurg> gfldex: thank you!

[19:23] <gfldex> yw

[19:23] <vrurg> But _that_ simple... Wonder what could it be.

[19:24] <gfldex> Hopefully the cause is equally simple. :)

[19:24] <vrurg> Unfortunately, no idea when I could do it though.

[19:26] <vrurg> gfldex: There are only two places where it could go wrong. So, must be no too complicated.

[19:26] <vrurg> *not too

[19:35] <japhb> You had to jinx it, didn't you vrurg?  ;-)

[19:37] <vrurg> japhb: Sorry, that's where my English fails me. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't get the context. :)

[19:51] <nine> vrurg: You said out loud that it must not be too complicated, so it will be extra complicated

[19:52] <vrurg> Ah, in that sense! /me is punishing own mouth and washing it with soap... :D

[19:53] <japhb> vrurg: Oh, heh.  "jinx it" means you taunted reality.  Ah yes, what nine said.  :-)

[19:54] <vrurg> BTW, I wanted this expression on several occasions but didn't know how to say it. So, thanks for more education! :)

[20:02] <vrurg> nine: BTW, an optional parameter in NQP method ‚Äì would it be a performance problem?
