[12:36] <[Coke]> moon-child: that read better to me before the change. wonder if this is a US vs. UK thing
[12:43] * [Coke] finds https://www.writersdigest.com/write-better-fiction/is-none-singular-or-plural to back him up; signatures is plural, so the none should be treated as plural. (my 2c)
[12:54] <lizmat> fwiw, this change also felt weird to me  
[12:58] *** linkable6 joined
[13:09] *** reportable6 joined
[13:27] <nine> None of these versions is clearly correct.
[13:31] <nine> It is indeed a very subtle issue. "None" can be singular and plural. A nicely done explanation is: https://www.merriam-webster.com/video/is-none-singular-or-plural Though even after watching that it's a 50/50 case for me.
[13:32] <nine> It may boil down to whether it's any of the individuals matter or if the sentence is about the collectiveness of signatures, i.e. do we want to convey "we didn't find that one signature that matches" or "sorry, these signatures all fail to match"

[17:05] <[Coke]> yah, we could rephrase the error to avoid the issue.
[17:23] <nine> LOL looks like the majority of last week's updated Raku modules was on account of my uint fixing PRs :D

[21:10] <moon-child> '"we couldn't find one signature that matches" vs "these signatures all fail to match"'  good point
[21:10] <moon-child> though note that due to negation, 'not any' corresponds to the former, and 'not one' to the latter :)
[21:23] <nine> As I said, after reading multiple explanations I'm still square in the middle between singular and plural in this case :)
