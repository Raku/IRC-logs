[02:47] <Xliff> nine: I do appreciate where you are coming from, but the "operating system's page cache" isn't there for just Raku precomp blobs. It has to fight for space with -every application you are running-. It also doesn't allow for finely grained control of for the amount of memory used for raku-exclusive purposes.

[02:48] <Xliff> nine: But I understand you are working on RakuAST now. I'll post this on problem-solving for further comment.

[02:52] <Xliff> Fun fact: My Amazon-AWS-EC2 code has 24337 lines of code in 738 total compunits (including dependencies). It takes 2204.98 seconds. Using the parallel build feature, I can get that time down to 196.913s. This is on an AMD R9 5950x.

[07:52] <[Tux]> lizmat, I don't think it is a performance regression: it is still within the margins of daily flutter. The two were not run close after eachother. The first was found on an open xterm which I forgot to cut-n-paste

[18:10] <[Coke]> i don't expect it to work, but i hope it doesn't explode.

[18:10] <lizmat> I haz no idea

[18:11] <lizmat> MasterDuke might know

[18:11] <lizmat> it uses a libuv function, afaik

[18:15] <ugexe> they are just stubs i believe

[18:16] <ugexe> so i think they'll just do nothing
