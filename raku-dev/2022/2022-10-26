[07:34] <lizmat> Xliff: about 3.5x as fast

[07:34] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[07:38] <lizmat> .tell Xliff Actually, more than 7.4x as fast, if you want strings, as .comb.rotor() will give you lists that would need to get joined: .comb.rotor(3 => -2)>>.join

[07:38] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Xliff
