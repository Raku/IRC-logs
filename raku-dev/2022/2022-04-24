[14:58] <bartolin> There is one remaining thing that makes 'make install' fail on the JVM backend: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/86927cba53#commitcomment-72019481

[14:59] <bartolin> Probably it's not too important, but on the other hand it would be nice to have the installation working for the release.

[14:59] <bartolin> lizmat: could you have another look there?

[15:01] <lizmat> bartolin: so what is the error now?

[15:02] <bartolin> you can see it in the CI logs as well: "Failed to get the directory contents of '/home/vsts/work/1/rakudo/../install/share/perl6/vendor/dist': nqp::opendir: unable to get a DirectoryStream

[15:02] <bartolin> https://dev.azure.com/Rakudo/rakudo/_build/results?buildId=2667&view=logs&j=4b893f53-7e1e-5c61-1e1e-e4fc61ee1c48&t=eecb2d6d-5078-534f-db49-36810221fdff

[15:02] <bartolin> (I commented it on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/86927cba53)

[15:03] <bartolin> That directory is indeed missing and it is created with that commit reverted. (Probably on MoarVM as well.)

[15:05] <lizmat> could you try removing the "once"s and see if that helps ?

[15:09] *** frost left
[15:10] <bartolin> I'm compiling. But I don't have much time right now, so I can't investigate in depth ...

[15:11] <lizmat> thing is: that upgrade check is really a noop for any installation post 2016

[15:25] <bartolin> jepp, withouth the "once"s installation finishes. (And all the directories are created: {vendor,site}/{sources,resources,dist,bin}.) Maybe something is wrong with 'once' on the JVM backend.

[15:33] <bartolin> lizmat++

[15:33] <jdv> what's the risk/reward?

[15:33] <jdv> is it likely to break in a blin run?  is it important enough to wedge in the middlr of a release?

[15:33] <lizmat> an extra existence check always when loading a module

[15:34] <jdv> that doens't sound important enough to me

[15:34] <lizmat> indeed

[15:35] <lizmat> it was an optimization

[15:35] <jdv> ok, it can wait til next relase then
