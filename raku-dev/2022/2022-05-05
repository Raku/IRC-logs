[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: Tweaks in the exit handler

[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: 

[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - use standard NQP for loops

[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - fix copy-pasto in keep/undo phaser fast-path check

[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - move CATCH block to start of scope

[09:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - fix spello in comment

[10:00] <timo> https://vimeo.com/131385889?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=6548926 got recommended to look at this riemann thing, and watching the presentation it's like every slide i can say "oh this is in Supplies already"

[10:01] <timo> of course this video is already 7 years old, but we've also had supplies for quite a while

[10:07] <timo> "ten million requests per second" is perhaps a bit more than we usually pump through our supplies tho

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: Simplify KEEP / UNDO phaser handling further

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: 

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - store KEEP/UNDO phasers with their name in the !LEAVE-ORDER key

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - just run that, and check the name for special handling

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: - calculate the KEEP/UNDO flag only once

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: 

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: This saves 2 hash key lookups when there are any LEAVEish phasers,

[13:45] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-cleanup-exit-handler: at the expense of 1 nqp::islist.
