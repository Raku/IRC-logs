[14:42] <patrickb> I have now deployed the Rakudo CI bot at https://cibot.rakudo.org/ running against the production repos. I disabled reporting results back to GitHub, as to not disturb development.

[14:43] <patrickb> But test results can be looked at at the above (not so pretty) website.

[14:45] <patrickb> Currently only the OBS backend is active, as the Azure backend is still in development. It tests on x86_64, SystemZ, armv7 and aarch64. Kudos to nine for doing the legwork of building Rakudo on OBS!

[14:46] <[Coke]> Is there still an issue running blin?

[14:49] <[Coke]> .seen jdv

[14:49] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw jdv 2022-09-17T16:56:08Z in #raku: <jdv> iirc its kinda like distzilla from the perl world

[14:56] *** nebuchadnezzar left
[14:59] <lizmat> [Coke]: afaik there is

[15:07] <[Coke]> wow, Blin itself has a lot of deps. :)

[15:07] <[Coke]> ===> Extraction: Failed to find a META6.json file for Text::Diff::Sift4:ver<1.4.2>:auth<github:MasterDuke17> -- failure is likely

[15:12] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: Text::Diff::Sift4 install is broken, which impacts Blin

[15:14] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[15:15] <[Coke]> https://github.com/MasterDuke17/Text-Diff-Sift4/issues/8

[15:18] <[Coke]> Whateverable depends on that module directly, Blin on Whateverable

[15:20] <[Coke]> Not sure why it would be missing the meta6.json, since github has one.
