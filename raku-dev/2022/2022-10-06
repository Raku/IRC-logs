[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make Blob concatenation always return the left-hand type

[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Looking back at the history, this goes back until at least 2013 when

[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: it was implemented as returning Buf if the types didn't match.

[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[09:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Other Blob related infixes return the type of the left-hand side,

[09:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: so it makes sense to do this for concatentation as well.

[09:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[09:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: In response to #5071

[09:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/02a28de5bd
