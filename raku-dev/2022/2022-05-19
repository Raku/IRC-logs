[20:36] <vrurg> Xliff: I don't deal with RakuAST, but I'd guess that it's cached the bytecode.

[20:49] <Xliff> vrurg: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

[20:49] <Xliff> vrurg: Can you tell me where thee idea for Lock::Soft came from?

[20:51] <vrurg> Check out the sample script in the PR comments. It blocks if thread pool gets exhausted because each Lock blocks its thread.

[20:51] <vrurg> Lock::Async doesn't have this problem, but it is not recursive.

[20:52] <Xliff> Ah, thanks!

[20:52] *** [Coke] joined
[20:52] <vrurg> So, a Lock-alike was needed which would be based upon `await`.

[20:54] <Xliff> Nice work.

[20:56] <vrurg> Thanks. :)

[21:51] <Xliff> Hm... it would be nice if I could modify an existing AST. I thought that was part of the plan for RakuAST.

[21:52] *** londoed left
[21:52] <vrurg> I think you can _before_ it actually got compiled.

[21:53] *** londoed joined
[22:09] <Xliff> Hmmm...

[22:10] <Xliff> vrurg: And you are correct, sir!

[22:12] <Xliff> But unfortunately, you can't copy an AST into a new container to preserve a copy.
