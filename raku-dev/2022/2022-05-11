[21:12] <Xliff> nine: Will there be a mechanism to get the AST of a callable?

[21:50] <lizmat> Xliff: OOC, what would you want to do with that?

[22:17] *** Altai-man joined
[22:17] <japhb> lizmat: I dunno what Xliff has planned for it, but I bet Red could do miracles with that power.

[22:17] *** sena_kun left
[22:18] <SmokeMachine> Yes, that would be huge for Red!

[22:19] <SmokeMachine> (and I think I have asked for that before)

[22:20] <lizmat> let me rephrase: what would you want to do with that AST?

[22:21] <lizmat> modify it?  introspect it?  

[22:21] <lizmat> in the case of modify: I think you will only be able to modify a clone of the AST

[22:22] <SmokeMachine> I'd love to introspect and modify it

[22:22] <lizmat> as a sort of static optimization ?

[22:23] <SmokeMachine> I would translate the AST to Red::AST to create SQL from it

[22:23] <lizmat> I mean, I can understand how one would like to use RakuAST to *build* ASTs, and thus Callable

[22:24] <lizmat> I guess I'm lacking imagination at this late point in the evening for me...

[22:24] <lizmat> will sleep over it&

[22:24] <SmokeMachine> currently Red have to run the Callable (from `.grep {<HERE>}` for example) to try to understand what it's doing and generate the Red::AST... do that by reading RakuAST would be much simpler and much more powerful

[22:27] <SmokeMachine> I was planning on doing that with a custom compiler class... but if there is a way to get RakuAST from a Callable, that would be much easier
