[14:55] <nine> That's 2022-02-18?

[15:01] <jdv> yes

[15:04] <nine> yes

[15:04] <jdv> you're doing too much work already.  i don't want to cause any extra work for you.  i'm fine with skipping this release if that helps.  

[15:04] *** frost joined
[15:05] <jdv> Ok, then.  The Jan release is off.  Thanks for your service and have a good vacation!

[16:21] <nine> Good news! Rakudo JVM built successfully on fix_unsigned_for_merge

[16:23] <MasterDuke> nice

[17:15] <nine> make test is now looking good as well. The hang in t/08-performance/99-misc.t seems to be a preexisting issue.

[21:42] <MasterDuke> ugh, figuring out the right conditions for this ternary warning is annoying. not only do precedence.pm6 and Grammar.nqp not have all the same entries for the different kinds, they don't always agree

[21:42] <MasterDuke> `my %concatenation   := nqp::hash('prec', 'r=', 'assoc', 'left', 'dba', 'concatenation');` vs `my Mu $concatenation    := nqp::hash('prec', 'r=', 'assoc', 'list');`. note that 'assoc' is 'left' in one and 'list' in the other

[21:50] <MasterDuke> maybe it should just be reverted until after rakuast
