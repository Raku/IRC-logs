[02:42] <vrurg> .ask jdv do you know if Blin runs against zef ecosystem modules? I just realized that Config::BINDish must be failing for as long back as since 2021.10. But it's never been reported.

[02:42] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to jdv

[12:20] <Altai-man> ping lizmat

[12:20] <lizmat> pong Altai-man 

[12:21] <Altai-man> hi! I am looking at this now...

[12:21] <Altai-man> m: say CORE::('&dd'); say CORE::.keys.grep(*.contains('dd'));

[12:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8e69321f: OUTPUT: «&dd␤(&atomic-fetch-add &atomic-add-fetch)␤»

[12:21] <Altai-man> I assume it's due to `dd` being is-implementation-detail.

[12:21] <Altai-man> But is there a way to overcome it?

[12:21] <lizmat> yup, think so

[12:23] <lizmat> m: say CORE::.keys(:implementation-detail).grep(*.contains("dd"))

[12:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8e69321f: OUTPUT: «(&dd &atomic-add-fetch &atomic-fetch-add)␤»

[12:23] <Altai-man> oooh, thank you very much!

[12:24] <lizmat> you're welcome :-)
