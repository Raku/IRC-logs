[10:31] <sena_kun> anyone knows how can I contact rba ?

[11:10] <nine> sena_kun: he's on IRC

[11:12] <sena_kun> yes, but not responding. I already pinged maettu and wrote an email to the infra email we have

[12:13] <nine> OMG I just made the first real progress on my current RakuAST issue in 4 months

[12:16] <nine> That issue being ::?CLASS in NativeCall::Types::IntTypedCArray::allocate pointing at CArray instead of CArray[int8]. Turns out, all this time I've looked in the wrong area. It's not that we somehow pick up the wrong ::?CLASS variable. Instead, it's a precompilation issue. And this is the issue that Perl6::Actions::begin_time_lexical_fixup is about (most probably).
