[15:57] <carlmasak> greetings, #raku-dev

[15:57] <tellable6> 2022-05-04T19:48:47Z #raku <tonyo> carlmasak agreed (re:haskell's stability in dependencies)

[15:58] <carlmasak> very few languages/communities get stability in dependencies right. it should be an immutable model (similar to Git), otherwise there will always be, how to say, needless breakage

[16:00] <carlmasak> "hey, let me just update this dependency for you without asking -- what do you mean you don't have time to run all the integration tests, it's just a patch upgrade, don't be so squeamish"

[17:03] <carlmasak> ...it's quiet here tonight :)

[17:04] <carlmasak> I think I just realized something about bottom-up parsing. anyone written a bottom-up parser? except for pmichaud who is not here
