[17:42] <lizmat> Xliff: not sure.. would have to look that up

[17:56] <SmokeMachine> is a point release going to be done? 2022.06 is breaking Red, right?

[17:56] <SmokeMachine> people using Red should not update, right?

[18:07] *** reportable6 left
[18:08] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: yeah, looks like

[18:09] <lizmat> could you verify that it is not broken on HEAD atm ?

[18:09] <SmokeMachine> I tried that after your fix and that was working... I'll try that again now

[18:10] *** reportable6 joined
[18:18] <SmokeMachine> and is there any idea of why Blin haven't found the problem?

[18:21] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: it seems to be working: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/I6X0J7qV/image.png

[18:21] <lizmat> ok, good to know

[18:21] <lizmat> I guess we need to ping jdv

[18:29] <SmokeMachine> I'm going to release Red and I don't know if I should add any kind of warning on GH/doc page about 2022.06...

[18:33] <lizmat> perhaps you could code it into Red, to say you cannot run on that ?

[18:33] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: that's a good idea

[18:59] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: would you agree with this message? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FgZU49GU/image.png

[19:00] <SmokeMachine> thanks

[19:01] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OI3G39Gg/image.png

[19:06] <SmokeMachine> does that make sense?

[19:12] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: sorry, was distracted

[19:12] <SmokeMachine> np :)

[19:13] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: perhaps make it more lines of ~70 chars each ?

[19:13] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking on breaking it in multiple lines...

[19:24] <patrickb> Any dev around that's able to provide pointers on how to hunt a precomp error?

[19:24] <lizmat> what's the error ?

[19:24] <patrickb> I think the app I'm working on fails to recompile a changed source file and happily runs with old precomp files.

[19:25] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NiwNY3MA/image.png

[19:25] <patrickb> I could just nuke the precomp dirs, but maybe the constellation is of value to someone more knowledeable.

[19:34] <lizmat> patrickb: been in a similar situation

[19:35] <lizmat> you could try https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Repository::Precomp::Cleanup

[19:36] <lizmat> and if that fails, well, nuke install  :-)

[22:06] <patrickb> Argh! Read through large parts of the above docs, gained some understanding to debug this further, only to have the misbehavior disappear, because stupid me modified the repo chain.

[22:07] <patrickb> So now I'm waiting for the behavior to reappear ASAP so I won't have forgotten half of what I know now again.

[22:07] <patrickb> Meh.

[22:07] <lizmat> sounds very familiar  :-(

[22:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: use a ternary to set up the type of native that didn't match

[22:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: This is mainly about having to do fewer checks and reducing the
