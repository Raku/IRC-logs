[07:53] <Jiminy> Is it true the voices that Raku underwent an hostile takeover by the Perl foundation (Yet Another Society) that acquired all the intellectual properties and trademarks and applied an autocratic rule, and this stopped its development?

[08:35] <AlexDaniel> weekly: Did you know that whateverable (a project that allows the creation of tools like Bisectable and Blin) was created over 6 years ago? Recently, a user has left a comment on a 5 year old gist. They say: “Zszw”. https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/8980b3ebc20a8dbcf51780a572337dd4
[08:35] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted! (weekly)
[08:37] <AlexDaniel> I don't know if it's remarkable enough, I just found it funny :)
[08:41] <nine> Jiminy: that makes no sense at all.
[08:41] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to Jiminy

[15:07] <gfldex> lizmat: rand_r() is reentrant, while rand() is not. I believe we use the latter under the hood. In a (potential) threaded application, this is a poor choice. However, since rand_r() is sharing state, a poor choice may be the best we can get.

[15:39] <japhb> gfldex: MoarVM uses tinymt64 (based on Mersenne Twister), and keeps random state per-thread.
[15:40] <japhb> Mind you, scheduling your random number generation in a thread pool is likely to weaken that ....
