[11:29] <ggoebel> Kaiepi: I think in the second example if you remove method foo { callsame } from class C... then it isn't surprising that class D is considered more specific in the class precedence list.

[11:33] <ggoebel> if I understand correctly... in this context callsame is a function which calls the next matching candidate for the linearization of class E's method resolution order... not class C's
