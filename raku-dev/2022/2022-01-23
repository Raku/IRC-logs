[12:34] <lizmat> Files=1351, Tests=117094, 336 wallclock secs (39.24 usr 10.65 sys + 4459.69 cusr 375.89 csys = 4885.47 CPU)

[12:34] <lizmat> this timing feels off compared to the last one... so I would take it with a grain of salt, unless it is repeated tomorrow :-)

[14:52] <Xliff> p6-Suite Timings all cancelled due to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4734

[14:53] <Xliff> I couldn't get the non-parallel timings done.

[14:55] <gfldex> I just took some timings and within 14 days make spectest went from 5m0.051s to 4m33.634s .
