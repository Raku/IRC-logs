[15:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[15:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: They proved to be unclaimed. Besides, if needed, they can be replaced
[15:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: with new-disp implementations. That is likely to be even more efficient.
[15:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Therefore it makes sense to spare some memory by getting rid of the ops.
