[20:49] <MasterDuke> ugexe, nine, lizmat: if i add a binary sha1 op, how/where should i test it for module loading?
[20:53] <lizmat> good question: src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/FileSystem.pm6, method id seems like a good place to start looking
[20:54] <lizmat> it could also be hidden in src/Per6 somewhere
[20:55] <lizmat> looks like it's not
[20:55] <MasterDuke> well, i can easily find where we call nqp::sha1. what i'm not sure of is which ones could/should be replaced with the binary sha1 op
[20:56] <MasterDuke> but yeah src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/FileSystem.pm6 does look like a good place to start
[20:57] <lizmat> in there is a recursive check for the all of the files living in that directory
[20:57] <lizmat> where each file's contents is being sha'd
[21:19] <lizmat> MasterDuke: you might want to look for DIR-RECURSE   :-)

[23:37] <ugexe> Remember CURs work with distribution interfaces, which may or may not be exposing PIO (so if you do a binary sha1 it should be on blob/buf)
