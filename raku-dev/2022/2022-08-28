[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make generics work with return type in signature
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Code return type can now use a type capture and its derivatives.

[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:     sub foo(::T, $a --> T) { $a }
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: `T` can be used in combination with smiley typing and coercion.
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[02:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: A couple of linked problems has been resolved too.
