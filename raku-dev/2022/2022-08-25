[14:07] <jdv> lizmat: around?

[14:07] * lizmat iz ere

[14:10] <jdv> i mentioned it on sunday but i got too busy after.  anyway, i think we have a hard blocker on the release.

[14:11] <jdv> Blin seems broken and i tried last night for a bit to fix it and no joy.

[14:14] <lizmat> hmmm   meh

[14:14] <lizmat> sena_kun ^^  ideas ?

[14:18] <jdv> from what i know the "mothership" (where the builds come from) switched to a glibc that's quite high, like debian testing high, and i'm not sure how to adapt.

[14:18] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/ffa82e105b75a90d3ff87804005a174b

[14:18] <jdv> or http://logs.liz.nl/raku-dev/2022-08-21.html

[14:21] <jdv> i can post how far i got later today in a branch on blin but release tomorrow is near zero and this month idk:(

[14:21] <lizmat> ok, let's skip this month then

[14:39] <ab5tract> vrurg: in response to " 	I think the problem is about compile-time resolution of A[T]. Not sure worth the time fixing it considering that the current parser is basically in deprecated state."

[14:39] <tellable6> hey ab5tract, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/5833193a02f063c2968725821dd0f469

[14:41] <ab5tract> does that mean that the non-deprecated parser replacement would have this fixed already?

[14:41] <ab5tract> and is the replacement based on the switch to Raku AST?

[14:41] <ab5tract> I hope niner didn't burn out too badly on it

[14:42] <vrurg> ab5tract: No idea. The only thing guaranteed about RakuAST is that it would be passing spectests and blin runs.

[14:44] *** melezhik joined
[14:50] <sena_kun> lizmat, I won't be able to give a better insight than Alex, and he's already aware I see.

[14:50] <ab5tract> Right, I don't expect that it will automatically fix it. I guess I'm asking whether my assumption that the current parser is considered deprecated because RakuAST will be the place to fix it

[14:50] <ab5tract> *is correct

[14:51] <lizmat> sena_kun: thanks

[14:51] *** melezhik left
[14:55] <vrurg> ab5tract: You guess it right. 

[14:57] <vrurg> ab5tract: Though if you remind me the code which fails, the fix could be just a one-liner.

[15:14] <ab5tract> m: role A[::T] { has $.b; method a(T $b) { A[T].new(:$b) } }; my A[Int] $f = A[Int].new.a(55)

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4f519c2ea: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to $f; expected A[Int] but got A[T] (A[T].new(b => 55))␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:14] <ab5tract> vrurg: a one-liner fix would be amazing. but I think it is likely to be a more complicated issue, unfortunately

[15:15] <ab5tract> I'd be happy to be surprised in this manner, though :)

[18:20] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/b0e01b729569135c3e1a663a41c7d347 - one todo passed, one failure on a fresh M2 airbook

[18:30] <vrurg> [Coke]: the TODO is a fresh addition for handling `my \v1`-like lexicals.

[18:31] <vrurg> I forgetting to un-todo it.

[20:03] <vrurg> ab5tract: It is a one-liner, after all. ;)

[20:16] <ab5tract> :O

[20:17] <ab5tract> so it will in the end enable referencing `T` everywhere in the role code? 

[20:19] <ab5tract> thus being able to do something like `role Tree[::T] { method create-node(T $val) { Node[T].new($val) }}` ?

[20:22] <ab5tract> I also ran into trouble trying to use parameterized role object in a recursive call but I haven't created a minimal example of it yet

[20:25] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/pull/818

[20:31] <vrurg> ab5tract: Looks like. It golfs down to `role A[::T] { method a { A[T] } }; A[Int].a ~~ A[Int]` and this is what I test over.
