[11:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Getting "b" formats more in line with sprintf

[11:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: And probably other integer based formats such as x, d, o.  Still

[11:43] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: a long way to get it in sync with nqp's sprintf.

[12:35] <nine> bartolin: the JVM is going to need to support fallback resolvers to support code compiled from RakuAST. A fallback resolver is a code ref taking a name as a string and returning a value. It is used when lexical lookup failed. This mechanism replaces the wrapper frames the old compiler frontend creates when compiling a frame dynamicall (i.e. BEGIN time execution)_
