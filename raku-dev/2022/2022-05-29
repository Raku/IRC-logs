[11:34] <Kaiepi> why can't this be ((Baz) (Foo) (Bar) (Any) (Mu))?

[11:47] <lizmat> because at one point it was decided that only simple linear subclass dependencies would be allowed, and if you wanted something else, you'd have to use roles ?

[11:55] <nine> (Baz) (Foo) (Bar) would mean that given a method in Foo that's overwritten in Bar, if you call that method on Baz, you'd get the one from Foo, not from Bar. So now you have a Bar object (because Baz is Bar) where you call a method on it that exists in Bar but get the one from Foo instead.

[11:56] <Kaiepi> ah

[11:56] <Kaiepi> finding out c3 is a thing outside rakudo helps somewhat
