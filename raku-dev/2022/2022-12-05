[00:30] <MasterDuke> huh, locally the Range version is a bit slower
[00:31] <MasterDuke> for 10k iterations, Range version is ~3s and List version is ~1.5s
[00:31] <MasterDuke> with Rakudo 2022.12
[00:36] <MasterDuke> oh, it looks like i just got a couple lucky spesh runs in a row. with MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 they both are ~3s

[00:42] <MasterDuke> that's the problem, the range is getting expanded into a list
[00:42] *** Xliff left
[00:52] <MasterDuke> ah, `multi sub roll($n, +values)`, so since Range does Iterable, it gets expanded. so you have to use the method form of roll or explicitly put the range in a scalar and then use that

[14:32] <notable6> lizmat, No notes for “weekly”
[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lizmat: what will the merge of the rakuast branch mean in practise? things remain more or less the same, except you don't need to build a separate branch to allow the rakuast version with that environment variable?
[15:46] <lizmat> good question: jnthn has stipulated that RakuAST module support should be available through a "use experimental :rakuast" pragma, and I think we still need to figure out the best way to do that
[15:47] <lizmat> but mostly you wouldn't notice anything, most likely
[15:47] <lizmat> just that if in 6.e.PREVIEW and doing a "use experimental :rakuast" would give you access to the RakuAST:: module tree
[15:48] <lizmat> so you can build code in an object oriented manner, rather than needing to use EVAL

[20:41] <ggoebel> the raku-advent.blog site currently doesn't provide a link to see all 2022 posts... just "Full list of 2021 Raku Advent Blog Posts". Someone with privileges to do so, might want to fix that.
[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that link does exist though, apparently, just isn't "provided"
[20:42] <ggoebel> right... https://raku-advent.blog/category/2022/ works
[20:43] <ggoebel> the url exists... a link to it doesn't
[20:44] <ggoebel> I always enjoy reading the articles. thanks to the folks taking the time to write them :-)

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> better late than never.... what does "spesh" mean actually?
[23:10] <ggoebel> jnthn coined the term spesh. I believe it refers to a little bit of specialization. Though it may be overloaded with other meanings.
[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Hopefully vrurg can tell something about that later on 🥺

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a good 8 years
[23:21] <ggoebel> From https://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-yapceu-performance.pdf slide #48: Enter Spesh
[23:21] <ggoebel> Spesh is the name for
[23:21] <ggoebel> MoarVM's "type specializer"
[23:21] <ggoebel> (Why? If we called it "spec"
[23:21] <ggoebel> everyone would say it wrong,
[23:21] <ggoebel> or try to Google "Perl 6 spec")
[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> when parrot still existed
[23:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I for one tried to google "Raku spesh" and that didn't help but anyway - thank you for enlightening me
