[17:10] <[Coke]> we really want to eventually update our release methodology so we just can't get last minute commits.

[17:11] <[Coke]> (either gatekeeping master, or doing the release from a branch)

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes, and also at least check what might need to be update in the documentation

[17:43] <sena_kun> jdv++ I feel you

[17:43] <tellable6> 2022-11-16T02:04:48Z #raku <[Coke]> sena_kun assigned some tickets to you in raku/doc because I think they'll go away post-new-site

[17:43] <sena_kun> true

[17:43] <sena_kun> [Coke]++ I saw some recent efforts on the doc repo, impressive!

[17:53] <[Coke]> wish I could take credit. :)

[17:54] <[Coke]> but yes, forward motion!
