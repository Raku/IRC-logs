[18:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[18:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Apparently, some modules in the ecosystem call this method (which I

[18:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: would consider an implementation detail as it is untested and undocumented)

[18:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: directly.  This solves some of the error messages as seen in Blin

[18:19] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: run #1 for 2022.04, but not all.  Here's hoping another Blin run can

[18:33] <japhb> Can you tell why those modules were using REPL.repl-eval?  Where they building their own REPL on top of it or something?

[19:01] <jdv> we could likely have said "here's a ticket saying this broke - don't use it like that"

[19:01] <jdv> but cool
