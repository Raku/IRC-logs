[10:58] <Xliff> I hope someone was joking when they made this comment":

[10:59] <Xliff> "nine	Know what? Just forget it. As I will any issues you may report. Getting shouted at by people one is trying to help is decidedly not -Ofun"

[10:59] <Xliff> #4655 and several other issues have resulted in improvements for Raku. For you to say you will start ignoring my issues is unprofessional, childish and counterproductive.

[11:00] <Xliff> Someone deliberately not understanding what I am saying clearly  was not -Ofun for me, either. 

[11:00] <Xliff> Also: Arguing for the sake of arguing, which was not my intent.

[11:01] <Xliff> Do what you will.

[11:01] *** Xliff left
[11:08] <lizmat> "Someone deliberately not understanding what I am saying" is assuming lack of good will.  I think that is incorrect from nine's *OR* your side

[11:08] <lizmat> "For you to say you will start ignoring my issues is unprofessional, childish and counterproductive."

[11:09] <lizmat> 1. re unprofessional: this is open source, anybody can ignore issues brought up by anybody

[11:10] <lizmat> there are *many* people lurking and not saying / responding / or even looking at your issues, yet reaping the benefits of anything positive that comes from them

[11:10] <lizmat> if there is someone to be angry with, it's the people just taking and not giving anything to open source projects in general, and Raku in particular

[11:13] <lizmat> 2. re childish: no, it is not childish.  Yet in the hope that we all still have our inner child, I should hope we can behave as adults here.  Accusing someone of being childish, especially someone who has done so much for Raku, is not adult behaviour

[11:14] <lizmat> 3. re counterproductive: perhaps, but your discussion with nine definitely was *not* productive for you.  Nine taking themselves out of the discussion, would at least prevent further counter-productive discussions

[11:14] <lizmat> </rant>

[18:08] <japhb> lizmat: Why would you want to be able to assign to them?  What's the use case, I guess I'm asking?

[18:08] <lizmat> the reason I'm asking, is that at the current state, you can  :-)

[18:11] <japhb> Yeah, I'm surprised they're writeable.  Not that you couldn't pull some fun shenanigans by overwriting history, that feels very much in "you think it's cute *now*" territory to me.
