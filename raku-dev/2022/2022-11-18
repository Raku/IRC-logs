[19:08] <lizmat> ugexe: would you consider the "depends" in this META to be correct? https://github.com/azawawi/raku-file-which/blob/master/META6.json

[19:10] <ugexe> yes

[19:10] <ugexe> i even wrote it

[19:11] <lizmat> ok, well, it broke some expectations in my Ecosystem module

[19:12] <lizmat> shouldn't there be a "requires" in there somewhere ?  And/or a "runtime" ?

[19:12] <ugexe> depends in an array in this instance, so no

[19:13] <lizmat> ok, thanks!  :-)

[19:14] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/t/distribution-depends-parsing.rakutest

[19:14] <ugexe> that should have most/all the variations

[19:43] <vrurg> We, actually, have a module for that in the ecosystem.

[19:44] <vrurg> lizmat: perhaps you can use https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/System::Query?

[20:18] <ugexe> honestly might as well use the variant in zef, which will have more updates. but yeah its based on that

[20:18] <ugexe> it even has docs - https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/lib/Zef/Utils/SystemQuery.rakumod

[21:14] <vrurg> I know, I borrowed from zef for PR#5060. :) SystemQuery is good because it's a standalone module. I don't remember if zef provides it as a public API. Guess not.

[22:17] <ugexe> Zef::Utils::SystemQuery has a `our sub system-collapse($data) is export`

[22:17] <ugexe> and it has documentation

[22:17] <ugexe> im not sure if it gets any more public than that

[23:09] <vrurg> ugexe: then I just overlooked the documentation. Makes it much better choice then.
