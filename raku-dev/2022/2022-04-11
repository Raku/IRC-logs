[19:21] <lizmat> ok, so that is definitely a step back from before  :-(
[19:24] <Xliff> Yes, last week's regular compile time was better.
[19:24] <lizmat> Xliff: could you try on 2022.03-193-g1bdebbba8    it helped me in the installing core modules time
[19:24] <lizmat> or are you not using CURI ?
[19:24] <Xliff> I am not using CURI
[19:24] <lizmat> hmmm
[19:25] <Xliff> Again, my problems with CURI is user interraction.
[19:25] <lizmat> yeah... it's still on my radar...
[19:30] <Xliff> Thank you.
[19:30] <Xliff> lizmat: Avg non parallel time is 287.98s. Avg parallel compile time is 50
[19:31] <Xliff> Those are both too long to go without some form of prompting from the install process.
[19:31] <Xliff> s/prompting/notification/
[19:31] <lizmat> I'm  not sure how to interpret those numbers
[19:31] <Xliff> Average time to precompile.  Current CURI doubles those numbers. All without any form of notification.
[19:32] <Xliff> So a new user wanting to install any of my modules would have to wait an average time of 6 minutes.
[19:32] <Xliff> Most folks abort non-responsive programs after 180 seconds.
[19:37] <lizmat> agree.. I think I can make something that would allow you to specify a callback when calling .install on a CURI object.  So basically, it would tell you when something would get precompiled
[19:37] <lizmat> but it wouldn't be able to tell you how many precompilations there would be in total
[19:38] <lizmat> so you would be able to tell something is going on, but not really how for you got
[19:41] <lizmat> Xliff: so e.g. in this case: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/7e80cb6e387a086d4bc5df32f373eb0c
[19:41] <lizmat> the installer would only see the left-most ones: aka Git::Status and Ecosystem::Archive::Update
[19:43] <Xliff> Actually, I am working along the same lines.
[19:43] <Xliff> The work is done, but I am not seeing any output from zef.
[19:43] <Xliff> I don't know why. I think I left you a link to the work a while ago.,
[19:43] <Xliff> For one thing, I might not be using the right Installer object.
[19:44] <Xliff> Yes. I think I've seen this. It's a step in the right direciton.
[19:45] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/rakudo/tree/curi-events
[19:45] <Xliff> Particularly: https://github.com/Xliff/rakudo/blob/curi-events/src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/Installation.pm6
[19:47] *** childlikempress is now known as moon-child
[19:48] <lizmat> Xliff: why so many different events?  wouldn't precompile starts / installation finished be enough?
[19:48] <lizmat> resources/ script installation is basically just a file copy, making an even for that just slows things down
[19:49] <Xliff> lizmat: I can trim off  the other events easily enough.
[19:50] <lizmat> anyways, I like KISS, so the simplest thing would be a call back parameter to "install"
[19:50] <lizmat> that would be called whenever a precomp starts, with the file name
[19:55] <lizmat> potentially for *each* file being precompiled, with maybe an index into 
[19:55] <lizmat> something like 1/10 foo     1/10 bar (because dependency of foo), 2/10 baz.... etc
[19:57] <lizmat> Xliff: also: if you are sure you don't need tests, or you can do them seperately, you can install your modules with your own script that has a CURS and not have to worry about zef not showing the output
[20:00] <nine> lizmat: there's no need to tell the consumer things they already know like the number of modules to be precompiled. Or the number of the currently precompiling one for that matter. If they want, they can count those easily enough

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/CURS.candidates: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/compare/0f33b87e29e4...95b4058045ec
[20:03] <lizmat> nine: I think Xliff's point is exactly that: the user does *not* know that
[20:03] <nine> How is that possible?
[20:03] <lizmat> because the user says something like:  zef install foo
[20:03] <lizmat> does the user know how much would need to be precompiled for that ?
[20:04] <nine> The "user" in your sentence does not usually talk directly to Supplies. That's why I used the word "consumer", i.e. the callback
[20:06] <lizmat> nine: so you're implying that when we run CURI.install, we can be sure that there will be no recursion to precompile dependencies ?
[20:06] <lizmat> or: in other words: if a dist has N files in its provides, that only N files will ever be precompiled ?
[20:07] <nine> What else would it precompile? That's the semantics of the install method. "Take this dist and install the modules it contains"
[20:07] <lizmat> because all of the non-dist dependencies will have been precompiled before ?
[20:08] <Xliff> nine: Again, the user does not know what they want to know, so why not provide what we can tell them?
[20:08] <Xliff> A new user to Raku would not know to look at META6.json
[20:09] <Xliff> If we want to draw more new users to the language, it would help to polish things.
[20:10] <Xliff> My use case: A CIO wants to know how long it would take to get things ready for a Raku class. He has a lab of x machines. He has a list of compunits he wants to install.
[20:10] <lizmat> or maybe she even  :-)
[20:10] <Xliff> A helpful install process would tell him things like: # of compunits precompiled and time taken to install each compunit.
[20:10] <Xliff> lizmat: Good point. :)
[20:10] <lizmat> having been in that situation myself a few times  :-)
[20:11] <Xliff> s/time taken to install each compunit/time taken to install each distribution/
[20:12] <lizmat> have to go afk for a while, I'll get back to this...
[20:16] <nine> All information that the installer program can already provide - today.
