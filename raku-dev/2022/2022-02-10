[20:14] <vrurg_> jdv: that was a minor fix, it wouldn't affect the release.

[20:14] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[20:56] <jdv> changelogs are up - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft & https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[20:58] <jdv> again, tomorrow will be the first attempt at the 2022.02 release

[20:59] <MasterDuke> jdv: i think there was talk that https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/71c62e7c1121c19e7c486de5f56d0e7d13855ce1 should be reverted before the release

[22:19] <jdv> because of https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4719 ?

[22:22] <MasterDuke> yeah. i haven't figured out a better way to decide when to warn, and the precedence info right now is split in two places

[22:22] <MasterDuke> probably something to revisit after rakuast

[22:22] <jdv> oh, ok.  can you revert it then?
