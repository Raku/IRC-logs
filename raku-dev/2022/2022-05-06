[16:29] <[Coke]> Would definitely be interested in finding devs who would be willing to contributes notes/comments on open documentation issues (missing docs, requests for updates, the checklist for each release to cover new stuff). Please ping me. I'm happy to take even just sample code on how to use a feature with some notes and I can turn that into something for the doc site.

[16:34] <[Coke]> lizmat++ has been doing this a bit lately, and it's been very helpful. If there's a particular area of functionality you'd be interested in, I can even curate open issues around that so you don't have to search through the 600 tickets.
