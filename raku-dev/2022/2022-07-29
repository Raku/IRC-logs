[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Revert "Revert "Add CUR::Staging.candidates method""

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: This reverts commit 4fc3d455b0b0362cceadf35674315050d60e6774.

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: I've come to the conclusion that the problem described in #4949

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: exists before and after the revert.  Since the revert appears to

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: cause a new issue, I'm reverting the revert.

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: So now we're at a version back again with a CUR::Staging with its

[08:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: own "candidates" method.

[11:25] <Kaiepi> seeing if addressing the "// this is dumb" aspect of the jvm's LibraryLoader alleviates anything with newer jvm versions

[11:25] <Kaiepi> since i figure that's where such a large chunk of memory is coming from

[11:25] <Kaiepi> in a build of CORE.d.setting

[11:33] <Kaiepi> if not, there *should* be a way to tweak the jvm to allow it to fit? that was my first guess, but i never managed to find the right flags...

[11:39] <Kaiepi> nope :(

[11:40] <Kaiepi> it kinda sucks that JarInputStream wants an entire chunk of memory to read? is there a way around that?

[11:42] <Kaiepi> i have a bytebuffer that's probably not contiguous, but it needs an InputStream of some sort

[11:44] <Kaiepi> custom impl...?

[12:16] <Kaiepi> damn, even with a lazier input stream, that's not the source of the allocation
