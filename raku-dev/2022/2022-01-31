[13:06] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/01/31/2022-05-foo-is-42/

[13:19] <Xliff> Thanks, lizmat

[13:36] <Xliff> lizmat: Where did you get the title picture for the latest weekly?

[13:38] <lizmat> It was made by Wendy or me..  during a roadtrip from SLC to Portland

[13:38] <lizmat> near Yellowstone

[13:39] <lizmat> so you're out there in the wild, with a fast streaming river

[13:39] <lizmat> and the water is warm!  :-)

[13:45] <jdv> so, i got a blin run in y'day and its a bit disturbing

[13:46] <jdv> i'm not sure how to post it yet cause its way over the char limit of a gh ticket at ~1.1m chars

[13:51] <lizmat> I think vrurg fixed a rather nasty thing related to smart matching yesterdya

[13:51] <lizmat> so today, it could possibly be a lot less?

[13:52] <Xliff> lizmat: Oh, thanks for that!

[13:52] <Xliff> It's a really lovely picture. Would love to fint that spot!

[13:53] <lizmat> it *is* a nice spot indeed  :-)

[13:54] <jdv> if i'm it looks like 39 out of 59 regressions are uint

[13:54] <jdv> i can only attribute 8 or 09 of the rest to vrurg on a quck skim

[13:55] *** discord-raku-bot left
[13:56] <jdv> "if i'm reading this correctly..."

[13:56] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[13:57] <jdv> i guess i could put it in a wiki page so others could at least see it rendered

[14:14] <jdv> nine: it would appear most of https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4748 may be unit

[14:15] <lizmat> s/unit/uint :-)

[14:15] <jdv> vrurg: ^ i think a few are yours

[14:15] <jdv> oops

[14:19] <vrurg> jdv: will try to look into it later today.'

[14:20] <jdv> thanks

[14:25] <jdv> how does a git bisect come up with 10 commits?  i've never seen that before.

[14:33] <[Coke]> failures or 3rd output mode in those 10 commits?

[19:15] <japhb> Nice week in CSV testing, dang!  :-

[20:14] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: 382f2f1084 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/core.c/Attribute.pm6

[20:14] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: Fix Attribute.(get|set)_value treating uints like str

[20:14] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: 

[20:14] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: Need to handle the new objprimspec 10 for uints

[20:14] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/382f2f1084

[20:14] <nine> jdv: ^^^ fixes some of the Blin errors

[20:24] <japhb> Oooh, doing a full rebuild to see if things got better for my stack.  :-)

[20:57] <japhb> Bah, still fails on Digest module

[20:57] <japhb> "Cannot unbox negative bigint into native unsigned integer"

[21:07] <lizmat> that feels... legit ?

[21:24] <nine> To be precise it seems to be: "Cannot unbox negative bigint -24 into native unsigned integer"

[21:25] <nine> So it's not something like -0xFFFF or the like which would look like a MoarVM bug

[21:30] <nine> That error is thrown by my uint32 $ = $y +^ ($x +| +^$z) with $x, $y and $z being uint32 though.

[21:31] <nine> What does +^$z actually mean?

[21:31] <nine> m: my $z = 1; say ^$z; say +^$z;

[21:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 382f2f108: OUTPUT: ¬´^1‚ê§-2‚ê§¬ª

[21:31] <nine> I don't understand what this does

[21:35] <nine> Oh, +^ isn't .Range.Numeric but bitwise negation. Ok, then that's just broken. Bitwise negation on uint obviously needs to return an uint

[22:00] <nine> It's not just that though. We also treat sized native integers incorrectly. It's kinda staggering how this pile of bugs somehow led to correct results previously.

[22:42] <leont> That happens sometimes
