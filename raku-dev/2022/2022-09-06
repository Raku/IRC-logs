[08:20] <Guest68> Hello everybody. I have been investigating a problem I have with rakudo on macOS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73414989/qqx-no-longer-works-in-raku-2022-04. The problem is a commit to libuv. For Darwin fork()/exec() has been replaced with posix_spawn(). A side effect of this change is that posix_spawn() treats all descriptors, regardless if

[08:20] <Guest68> opened or not with O_CLOEXEC, as if they had. This is the pull request: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/3064. I think that moar/raku/nqp (?) did not adapt to this change. The process is spawned but the output is lost. Do you know which component (moar, nqp, raku) I should examine?

[08:26] <lizmat> Guest68: I'd throw this on the #moarvm channel  :-)

[08:26] <Guest68> Will do. Thank you! :)
