[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The previous logic was too naive with absolute paths (just dropped the

[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 
[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The new implementation is now simpler by treating relative and absolute
[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: paths the same and only looking at the basename to decide whether to append
[21:52] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: an updir or drop an element.
