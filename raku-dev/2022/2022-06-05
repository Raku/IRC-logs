[21:21] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[21:21] <Xliff> Does anyone know what this error means?

[21:22] <Xliff> <Xliff> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GtkPlus/lib/GTK/Box.pm6 (GTK::Box)

[21:22] <Xliff> <Xliff> New type Stash for CompUnit::DependencySpecification is not a mixin type

[21:22] <vrurg> Can you get a full stack trace?

[21:22] <vrurg> --ll-exception, I mean.

[21:24] <Xliff> Um.... One sec.

[21:26] <vrurg> But in general it means that somewhere an attempt to rebless CUDS into Stash took place.

[21:26] <Xliff> vrurg: Try here https://gist.github.com/Xliff/2f7216dae1dd502b218e2f3de25d0e70

[21:29] <Xliff> vrurg: Also gettng errors when installing Attrx::Mooish

[21:31] <vrurg> BTW, what Rakudo release is it? Or is it master?

[21:32] <Xliff> It's blead

[21:33] <Xliff> AttrX::Mooish installs fine on 2022.03

[21:34] <vrurg> Also installs on my master.

[21:35] <vrurg> From the trace, it looks like a problem in MoarVM deserialization.

[21:39] <Xliff> Another thing... "zef look NativeLibs" is putting me in the DBIish distribution

[21:39] <vrurg> Xliff: do you, by occasion, use a BEGIN in the module?

[21:41] <vrurg> Somehow it looks like we have a big issue with serialization. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4933

[21:42] <Xliff> vrurg: Yes, plenty.

[21:43] <vrurg> I don't have sufficient information to make conclusions, but it very much feels to me like either a context get lost, or just some kind of general mess up happens.

[21:43] <Xliff> *sigh*

[21:43] <vrurg> Xliff: then it is likely that the issue I mentioned above is being caused by the same bug.

[21:44] <Xliff> Thewre are no BEGIN blocks in th at compunit. Might be one or two in the dependencies.

[21:44] *** sena_kun left
[21:45] <vrurg> Xliff: that's about the scenario. In lizmat's case the error is triggered with BEGIN is a use'd module.

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4944

[22:16] <Xliff> II have been having problems with this error, and it's finally pissed me off:

[22:16] <Xliff> P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol Container

[22:17] <Xliff> Why is this merge having issues? It's keying on "Container" when it should be keyng off of its full name.

[22:17] <Xliff> I am not even exporting the class, and it's still using the short name?

[22:17] <Xliff> I don't even know how to golf it  properly, although I will make a stab  at it, shortly.

[22:18] <Xliff> Can som,eone explain this issue to me?

[22:21] <vrurg> Xliff: I don't remember all the details, but the problem is about nesting symbols, not about exports. For A::B::C::D D may result in duplication if in one place you get a module A::B::C, and another place ends up with a stub package A::B::C which has symbol D in it.

[22:21] <vrurg> It's really not easy to golf down.

[22:22] <vrurg> And it is not easy to get fixed until we are capable of single-process precomping. 

[22:23] <vrurg> Because the sub package can be produced by one compiling process, whereas the module is compiled by another, and third one tries to load merge it all.

[22:25] <vrurg> I have the only workaround for this. For any delcared package A::B::C::D I have a `use A::B::C;` statement. In this case it is guaranteed that whenever symbols are merged they are merged into the same package object.

[22:26] <Xliff> Um. Ouch. That workaround kinda depends on the fact that you can have an A::B::C

[22:27] <Xliff> Thanks for letting me know about that, thougy. I may need to rearrange a lot of code.

[22:27] <vrurg> Xliff: BTW, I've got lost a bit. With regard to AttrX::Mooish – would you, please, report the issue? Perhaps it's something I can get fixed. Also, make sure it's not trying to use v0.8.900 which is a development branch and was published by accident. :(

[22:28] <Xliff> vrurg: Ah, OK. One thing. It was an issue that was t here with the 2022.04-87 

[22:28] <Xliff> It was not there with 2022.03

[22:28] <vrurg> Not only if you can have A::B::C, but also if it doesn't cause a circular dependency.

[22:28] <Xliff> Yes, figured that last bit! :)

[22:29] <vrurg> The problem with merging was always there, one way or another.
