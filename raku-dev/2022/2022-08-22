[12:46] <ab5tract> Is this a known issue with role parameterization?

[12:46] <ab5tract> m: role A[::T] { has $.b; method a(T $b) { A[T].new(:$b) } }; my A[Int] $f = A[Int].new.a(55)

[12:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar d059921b7: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to $f; expected A[Int] but got A[T] (A[T].new(b => 55))␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:52] <SmokeMachine> I've been having problems like that for a while...

[12:56] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: thanks for the workaround!

[12:57] <SmokeMachine> :)

[13:06] <ab5tract> Unfortunately the workaround is  goind to break down for the case of say, role Tree[::T] { ...; my $node - Node[T].new; ... }

[13:07] <ab5tract> s/-/=/

[13:13] <vrurg> I think the problem is about compile-time resolution of A[T]. Not sure worth the time fixing it considering that the current parser is basically in deprecated state.
