[12:45] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/04/04/2022-14-comma-completer/

[12:49] <[Coke]> https://www.securityweek.com/checkmarx-finds-threat-actor-fully-automating-npm-supply-chain-attacks

[12:51] <[Coke]> Forcing the authors to be registered elsewhere helps; does our new system deal with this kind of attack where someone is creating multiple auths?

[12:58] <lizmat> I guess the zef ecosystem links an auth to an email address

[12:58] <lizmat> and that's about it

[12:59] <lizmat> and technically, someone could upload a module "Foo" with a higher version than any "Foo" that's in there already

[13:00] <lizmat> the only way to make sure you get a correct version of your module in your code, is to at least also specify an "auth" in your use statement

[13:00] <lizmat> having said that, so far that hasn't been necessary, but then again, it's still early in Raku's life cycle

[13:22] <[Coke]> Sounds like that's a reasonable answer though: that we can trust/require an existing author.

[20:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/IO.dir-with-entries: doing e.g. an "if .dir.head {".  However, this will leak resources

[20:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/IO.dir-with-entries: as the iterator that runs "dir" will never be finished, and thus

[20:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/IO.dir-with-entries: the underlying directory handle will also never be closed.
