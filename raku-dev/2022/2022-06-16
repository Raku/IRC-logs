[13:17] <carlmasak> greetings, #raku-dev

[13:20] <lizmat> carlmasak o/

[13:22] <carlmasak> hi, lizmat. it must be mid-afternoon in your part of the world

[13:22] <lizmat> yea, 15:23 or so

[13:22] <carlmasak> here in .cn, we start every day a few hours earlier than Europe

[13:22] <carlmasak> must be the work ethic

[13:23] <lizmat> I guess...   :-)

[13:23] *** Kaiepi joined
[13:23] <carlmasak> :P

[13:24] <carlmasak> I know I mentioned it before, but I was one of the sad saps who bought a Beat watch from Swatch, many years ago

[13:24] <carlmasak> a "beat" is one thousandth of a 24-hour day, and you write the time like this: @499

[13:24] <carlmasak> and it's time zone independent

[13:25] <carlmasak> needless to say, this PR stunt from Swatch didn't catch on like wildfire

[13:30] <carlmasak> m: say (60 #`[seconds/minute] * 60 #`[minutes/hour] * 24 #`[hours/day]) / 1000 #`[beats/day]

[13:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar d253dc79e: OUTPUT: «86.4␤»

[13:30] <carlmasak> ...which makes a beat one minute and 26.4 seconds long.

[13:37] <lizmat> feels a bit like Tau::Station::DateTime?

[13:39] <[Coke]> does anything in the ecosystem given an idea of # of downloads/users, etc.?

[13:40] <lizmat> raku.land keeps some stats I think

[13:47] * patrickb is working on the RCB (Rakudo CI Bot).

[13:48] <patrickb> Currently implementing the branch matching logic. So when a commit in a PR should be tested it'll search for a matching branch in the respective other repos.

[13:48] <patrickb> Should a requirement for a branch to be picked be, that a repective PR exists?

[13:50] <patrickb> Or should it just take any same named branch in either the same project/user that the PR was created (or the rakudo/rakudo, Raku/nqp, MoarVM/MoarVM repos)?

[13:55] <patrickb> For now I'll go with just taking any matching branch name and not requiring a PR. Please comment if you object.

[13:56] <nine> I think that's a sensible thing to do

[13:57] <[Coke]> I think if we were all in on an automated workflow, a PR would be required, but this matching branch-if-exists seems reasonable to me
