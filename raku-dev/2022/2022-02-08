[18:28] <jdv> isn't that the purview of individual authors?

[18:38] <lizmat> jdv: it is, they were all mine  :-)

[18:42] <jdv> oof ^H

[18:45] <lizmat> each distribution was 3 files (usually)

[18:45] <lizmat> meta readme tar

[18:49] <jdv> still seems insane to me

[18:49] <jdv> anyway, looks like blin is down to just Trait::Traced.  I looked at it but couldn't seem to get a fix.

[18:50] <jdv> if nobody else can get a fix before release I guess we'll just have to be fine with an issue on it...

[18:50] <lizmat> jdv: yeah, the user interface meant I had to click a checkbox for each file

[18:52] <lizmat> it could well be that Trait::Traced will need an architectural change to have it work with the new way attribute initialization is handled

[18:53] <jdv> ew - hope your scripted that

[18:53] <japhb> Where's the current Blin ticket?

[18:55] <lizmat> jdv: felt overkill for a one-time event

[18:56] <jdv> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4765

[18:56] <jdv> the last one with "blin" in the title and label

[19:09] <lizmat> BTW, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4749 ?

[19:27] <nine> Actually 4749 does look quite serious. Definitely at least a spesh bug

[19:55] <nine> Oh, actually it seems to be a JIT bug

[19:55] <MasterDuke> haven't had one of those in a while
