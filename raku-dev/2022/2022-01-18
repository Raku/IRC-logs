[11:48] * lizmat is drawing a blank

[11:49] <lizmat> do we have a way in Raku to produce a string with the common root of two (or more) strings ?

[11:49] <lizmat> dd "abcd" root "abce";   # "abc"

[11:50] <lizmat> dd [root] <abcd abcd abde>   # "ab"

[11:54] <MasterDuke> so longest common substring, anchored at the start? not that i know of

[12:05] <lizmat> yeah, thought so  :-)

[12:07] *** reportable6 left
[13:04] <sena_kun> this sounds very specific

[13:05] <lizmat> it is...    but it can be handy sometimes, so I'll put it String::Utils  :-)

[13:16] <sena_kun> aye, that's a good idea. I was worried about putting it into the CORE. :)

[13:22] <lizmat> now in String::Utils in the ecosystem :-)

[13:25] <lizmat> well, actually now  :-)

[15:28] <vrurg> jdv: I'd like to merge R#4721 before the release because it re-claims back some of the performance lost when fix for junction in smartmatches was merged. But this would like need another blin round.

[15:29] <vrurg> *would likely

[15:29] *** linkable6 left
[15:30] <jdv> i can't run it today again.  maybe tomorrow.

[15:31] *** linkable6 joined
[15:32] <jdv> sure i guess.  but if blows up the next blin run its probably out

[15:32] <vrurg> Whenever it suits you. Just to make sure the merge is still possible prior to the release.

[15:32] <jdv> we already have a bunch of blockers to get through

[15:33] <vrurg> I think 2.6x faster `foo() ~~ bar()` worth it. :)

[15:36] <jdv> ok

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: 

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: This fixes the segfault uncovered by 71c62e7. Because `&infix:«+<»`

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: didn't have its precedence set, therefore the call to `.prec` went

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: through Code's `method prec`, which simple returns `my %`. For some

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: reason this is an HLL hash in the optimizer, so the atkey call in MoarVM

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: has problems. It shouldn't have segfaulted and probably still needs a

[17:23] <Geth__> ¦ rakudo: fix, but this change in Rakudo should happen regardless.
