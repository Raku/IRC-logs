[08:02] <nine> vrurg: I have noticed that the old make_smartmatch in some conditions bail out early and we generate an &infix chain op instead (just like for non-special operators). Porting that deciding code to IMPL-INFIX-QAST fixed that regex test for me but broke others

[13:37] <Xliff> P6-GLib suite timing statistics for Raku 2022.07.95.g.17062.c.32.f

[13:37] <Xliff> Total number of projects: 33 (502202 loc)

[13:38] <Xliff> Total non-parallel compile times: 8599.080 (260.578 avg)

[13:38] <Xliff> Total parallel compile times: 1301.379 (39.436 avg) 6.608x speedup

[13:38] <Xliff> Both parallel and non-parallel at 99% of the previous weeks times.

[14:09] <vrurg> nine: If nothing kills my plans for today, I'll look into it. BTW, raku-smartmatch dispatchers covers most if not all the logic, but from optimization point of view. I think it'd be more correct to get a reference implementation in pure AST first.

[14:11] <vrurg> I also hope that IMPL can take into account its child nodes. This may help a lot.

[19:14] <nine> vrurg: in general you have access to both RakuAST child nodes and at a later stage the children's QAST nodes.
