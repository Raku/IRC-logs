[04:51] <Xliff> Is there a master list of Nodes that RakuAST will implement documented anywhere? 

[04:51] <Xliff> Reason I ask is because it appears that a node implementing the "need" statement appears to be missing.

[04:52] <Xliff> I just wanted to mention it, even at the risk of being Captain Obvious. Hence my first question... to prevent this from happening in the future.

[08:54] <nine> There's no list. Node types are created as needed.

[18:11] <Kaiepi> m: use nqp; say nqp::eqaddr(nqp::atpos_i(nqp::list_i(),0),nqp::null())

[18:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4cdb55850: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[18:17] <Kaiepi> was worried for a second, nqp::null's probably coming from something silly instead

[18:34] <Kaiepi> there we go - helps to do an atpos_i when you want an atpos_i and not an atposnd
