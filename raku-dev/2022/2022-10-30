[13:47] <gfldex> should a gather/take block form a closure over a dynvar?

[14:20] *** frost9 left
[14:34] <lizmat> dynvars are not part of closures?   they're purely dynamic

[15:29] <lizmat> m: say "foo";last

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar a98f1cabe: OUTPUT: «foo␤===SORRY!===␤last without loop construct␤»

[15:29] * lizmat is surprised that this is a SORRY, which would imply a compile time error, when it clearly isn't ?

[16:00] <ugexe> probably from that

[16:04] <lizmat> so I guess the question: why doesn't it have a backtrace and/or why isn;t $e.backtrace.is-runtime true

[16:06] <lizmat> I mean running it --ll-exception *does* show a usable backtrace
