[04:37] <japhb> Looking for fresh eyes ... I have a routine that converts a 256-bit Int (representing a 16x16 bitmap) into a 16x16 matrix of actual 0's and 1's.  The fastest conversion I've found so far is:

[04:37] <japhb>     my str $binary = $bitmap.base(2);

[04:37] <japhb>     $binary = '0' x (256 - chars($binary)) ~ $binary;

[04:37] <japhb>     $binary.comb.map(+*).rotor(16).eager

[04:37] <japhb> Any ideas for faster conversion welcome!

[04:37] <japhb> One constraint: No nqp::ops.

[04:38] <japhb> (That second line, BTW, is to make sure there are really 256 entries, in case the bitmap has leading 0's.)
