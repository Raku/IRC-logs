[09:44] <[Tux]> is "perl6" there to stay, or should that be "raku"

[09:52] <[Tux]> a manual rerun even over 3.0

[09:52] <[Tux]> and there is no high system load

[09:52] <lizmat> yeah, definitely something bad happened

[09:53] <lizmat> [Tux] : could you go back out the latest NQP bump  and run again ?

[09:55] <[Tux]> that would require some digging

[09:55] <nine> The bump could only affect NativeCall and JVM backend

[09:55] <lizmat> ok, then I guess it was vrurg's last merges

[09:55] <nine> Showing that my question was very relevant: Shouldn't the $!is-wrapped PR have waited till after the release?

[09:56] <lizmat> ok, lemme see if I can revert that and check locally its effect on test-t

[10:09] <lizmat> step 1: performance loss confirmed

[10:09] <[Tux]> Pfweeuw, so not caused by a problem at my side.

[10:10] <lizmat> no   :-)  :-(

[10:16] <lizmat> yeah, it was most definitely vrurg's merge :-(

[14:22] <nine> vrurg: I still believe we can have improvements there. It's probably just some tiny issue that tanked performance

[14:23] <vrurg> nine: could even be a hidden exception somewhere. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4771

[14:24] <vrurg> But unlikely. To me it was plain throwing into the userland.

[14:27] <vrurg> Roast would need to be reverted too for now. Maybe I'll give it another try, but not soon.
