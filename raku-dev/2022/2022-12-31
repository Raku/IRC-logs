[13:15] <nine> Manifest0: just to make sure, that latest result was with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 but _not_ MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1?

[13:39] <Manifest0> nine: i tested with MVM_JIT_DISABLE and it didn't crash. 

[13:40] <Manifest0> either with MVM_JIT_DISABLE or MVM_SPESH_DISABLE doesn't crash

[14:04] <nine> Manifest0: that is definitely interesting. Can you please try again with MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1?

[15:26] <Manifest0> sure

[16:08] <Manifest0> nine: it still crashes with MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1

[16:17] <nine> Manifest0: so the bug is in the lego JIT.
