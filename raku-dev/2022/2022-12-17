[17:12] <Kaiepi> i'm wary of what the locking the parameterization Array::Shaped!RE-INITIALIZE does via RI.SHAPED-ARRAY-STORAGE might do in a threaded environment, but i'm not sure on how to prove anything happens as a result...

[17:13] *** melezhik joined
[17:14] <Kaiepi> i tried making 4 threads parameterize a bunch at the same time, but they seem to do it about the same speed?

[17:14] <Kaiepi> compared to changing it not to parameterize
