[20:47] <vrurg> "some MoarVM C-compiler fixes" got the build broken for me. :(

[20:52] <nine> broken how?

[20:55] <MasterDuke> i had to do a `make realclean` after the libuv bump, but everything is fine now

[20:59] <vrurg> About the same solution. Wiped out nqp/ and rebuild. It's ok now.

[20:59] <vrurg> It was something about libuv too.

[21:01] <MasterDuke> fwiw, `/usr/bin/ld: ./libmoar.so: undefined reference to `uv__cloexec_ioctl'` was the error i got when building moarvm

[21:10] <vrurg> MasterDuke: same here.

[22:00] <lizmat> weird, I had no such issues on MacOS

[22:00] <lizmat> I always build and spectest before pushing

[23:03] <vrurg> Looks like only Linux is affected. And, perhaps, not always.

[23:09] *** reportable6 joined
[23:37] <gfldex> I had the same and a fresh clone solved the issue.
