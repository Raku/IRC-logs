[14:57] <[Coke]> lizmat: L10N::DE has several commented out items in the "DE" file - is this intended to show that we are accepting the default EN version on those particular entries?

[14:58] <lizmat> no, it's intended to mark "untranslated"

[14:58] <lizmat> as of yet

[14:59] <[Coke]> I think that's what I was trying to say, thanks.

[15:01] <lizmat> yw  :-)

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Document / Streamline raku-assign dispatcher

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - document in docs

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - document each of the handlers in code

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - general streamlining

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make each handler return value (no use as of yet, but maybe later)

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   as the dispatcher itself is expected to return the container rather

[18:58] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 5 more lines…>
