[06:40] <ab5tract> Maybe it’s just pre-coffee brain, but I am failing to grok the problem in the above?

[07:49] <lizmat> m: enum E <one>; role R { has $.e = one; method m() { say $!e ~~ one; } }; R.new.m;

[18:49] <patrickb> The commit that is.

[18:49] <lizmat> yeah, I remember that well.... will be glad to get rid of it in RakuAST

[18:50] <lizmat> on that thought:
