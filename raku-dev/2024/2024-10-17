[21:49] <patrickb> I have a WIP PTY impl in MoarVM. I am able to resize it from within Moar. But now I want to expose that in raku land (basically a Proc::Async.set-size($cols, $rows)). Is a new op code the way to go, or is there some other more lightweight way to call into Moar from user space?

[21:49] <patrickb> o/ ab5tract

[21:50] <patrickb> My terminal emulator is coming along nicely. :-)
