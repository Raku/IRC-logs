[13:39] <jdv> how come i get the same zef error on head now?

[13:40] <jdv> nevermind, it seems to be working now

[13:47] <jdv> no, there's something actually wrong

[13:49] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/50922d3642b8be369e26875cd1ea1019

[13:50] <jdv> lizmat: ^

[13:50] <jdv> ugexe: ^

[13:50] <jdv> release on hold i guess

[13:51] <jdv> and now spectests are failing.  wonder if its on my side...

[13:51] <lizmat> I could revert 4a66ddd6cf5f8f71e886 and see if that helps?

[13:51] <linkable6> (2024-06-24) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4a66ddd6cf Improve `.flat` logic (2nd attempt)

[13:51] <jdv> do spectests pass for you?

[13:52] * lizmat checks

[13:52] <jdv> i'll try that again

[13:53] <lizmat> (first need to build a clean rakudo again, it had local changes)

[13:59] <lizmat> make test and make spectest are clean for me

[14:00] <jdv> the output from 2 spectests looks the same to me - a lot of fail

[14:00] <jdv> hmm

[14:00] <lizmat> if you want me, I could nuke install and rebuild from scratch to make sure

[14:00] <lizmat> I'll do that anyway

[14:00] <jdv> i'll do that myself first i guess just to confirm 

[14:00] <jdv> oh ok

[14:01] <lizmat> rebuilding...

[14:05] <lizmat> testing...

[14:08] <jdv> now my build is hanging on fetching moarvm's submodules.  wut?

[14:08] <lizmat> github hickup?

[14:09] <lizmat> fetch and build ok for me

[14:09] <lizmat> had one flapper: t/spec/S17-promise/start.t

[14:10] <jdv> idk, 3 times now

[14:10] <lizmat> 2nd time ok: ok 58 - No crash when doing parallel parsing of grammars on first time

[14:11] <lizmat> perhaps nuke ~/.raku/precomp as well

[14:11] <lizmat> zef installs itself ok for me

[14:18] <lizmat> ake installation fails because of deprecation messages messing up some tests that test STDERR output

[14:18] <lizmat> installs ok with RAKUDO_NO_DEPRECATIONS=1

[14:18] <jdv> my box is slower than yours:)

[14:18] <jdv> i think that's why i install from a checkout

[14:19] <jdv> how can we get that eco'd?

[14:19] <lizmat> how can we get what eco'd ?

[14:19] <jdv> released

[14:19] <jdv> head is not out there but the fix is in git

[14:20] <lizmat> I've lost you: are we talking about ake ?

[14:20] <jdv> yes.  the last commit on the ake github repo has the fix for the deprecation that's breaks tests on install.

[14:21] <jdv> but those changes are on on zef of p6c or cpan...

[14:21] <jdv> *fez

[14:21] <jdv> not on

[14:21] <jdv> i can't type.  new keyboard.

[14:21] <lizmat> ack... I'll do a release of ake momentarily

[14:26] <jdv> gotta do an errand.  bb in a bit.

[14:37] <lizmat> release of ake done, you may need to do a "zef update" to have zef know about it

[15:05] <jdv> i'm still unable to get a clean spectest run

[15:05] <jdv> i guess i'll try a build without that flat commit

[15:08] <lizmat> fwiw, are you on Intel ?

[15:09] <jdv> amd so "yes"

[15:09] <jdv> Linux jdv-lap2 6.1.0-21-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.90-1 (2024-05-03) x86_64 GNU/Linux

[15:10] <lizmat> ok, lemme try a clean install on an Intel box

[15:11] <lizmat> this will take a bit longer :-)

[15:11] <jdv> head seems unstable

[15:14] <lizmat> is that with the flat commit removed?

[15:15] <jdv> not yet.  just investigating the individual failures from the whole run

[15:15] <jdv> rebuilding with that commit reverted now

[15:31] <jdv> so with that reverted make test passes first time and spectest passed mostly first time with the exception of S32-list/flat.t

[15:32] <jdv> before i had to run make test multiple times to get it to pass and spectest never passed and had a lot of errors

[15:33] <jdv> can you repro something like that?

[15:33] <jdv> if not maybe we should skip the release until this is understood better?

[15:37] <lizmat> S32-lisr/flat fails because of the reverted commit

[15:39] <jdv> yeah but unreverted https://gist.github.com/jdv/c237639c2bfb036f6cce2af616e1315e is a bit concerning that you don't see that

[15:39] <jdv> and it seems reproducable here

[15:39] <jdv> not sure if its the exact same failures

[15:41] <lizmat> well, I'm seeing spectest failures on Intel without the revert as well

[15:42] <lizmat> so... I'm thinking the .flat commit is tickling the JIT (as the M1 doesn't have any JIT)

[15:43] <jdv> ok, so we're ok with doing the release with that stuff reverted in rakudo and roast?

[15:43] <lizmat> I'm ok with it

[15:43] <jdv> ah, right - forgot about that jit tidbit

[15:43] <lizmat> now that I know bout the different behaviour on Intel, I can check it out

[15:44] <lizmat> and come back with a better version  :-)

[15:44] <jdv> cool.  i'll restart the release then.

[15:44] <lizmat> *after* the release

[15:44] <jdv> good luck!

[15:56] <lizmat> jdv: running make spectest on Intel without the revert with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 is clean

[15:56] <lizmat> so it *is* definitely JIT related

[15:56] <lizmat> I'll investigate more *after* the release

[15:57] <jdv> ah, nice

[15:57] <jdv> thanks

[17:49] <jdv> for some reason git submodule calls are failing for me today 

[17:49] <jdv> the release might take forever to get through:)

[18:02] <[Coke]> :|

[18:07] <jdv> somehow seems like half of hte submodule updates end in timeout oh gh...  but seems to be ok for the moment.

[21:43] <finanalyst> I'm having a problem using `zef install .`  on my RakuAST::RakuDoc::Render distribution. The central module RakuDoc::Render requires use experimental :rakuast, but other modules in the distribution do not. However, one of those modules uses OO::Monitors, which RakuAST does not like. I can get the sub-modules to compile with 'ordinary' raku, then compile RakuDoc::Render with use experimental. How do I do this with zef 

[21:43] <finanalyst> install?
