[06:04] <timo> lots of output, but kind of not really obvious what's happening

[17:08] <ugexe> timo: the latest version of zef with --debug will output the commands zef uses for curl, tar, etc. its not incredibly useful, but i added it in response to your comments regarding a CI run that failed during part of the zef extraction phase. my hope is if we can copy the curl and tar commands used we will be able to tell what the underlying issue is

[17:11] <ugexe> for example maybe we copy the curl command and fine the path being created is indeed too long but curl still exists with 0. or that maybe there is something weird with how the -z option (only download if file is newer type logic) with curl works on windows / windows timestaps

[18:11] <timo> ugexe: thank you that does sound helpful, at least for this use case

[19:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈23 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft
