[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: fix smart matching against fake signatures

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Smart match on fake signatures uses dispatch machinery to determine

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: whether a call to the signature's associated code block would succeed.

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Thus the signature requires a code block in order for smart match to

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: work as intended. Create such a code block when creating the

[19:13] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: FakeSignature node.
