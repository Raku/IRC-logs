[10:25] <nine> I am somewhat surprised that you are considering something as drastic as changing name lookup of lexical vs global but not just adding lexical aliases for these enum values like we do for all other our scoped things.

[12:17] <ab5tract> Fair point

[12:19] <ab5tract> It did seem to me that the enum behavior was the anomaly here

[12:22] <ab5tract> Just a guess, but maybe the current behavior is due to the fact that enigma create quite a few more “types” per declaration than regular types do?
