[00:00] <lizmat> and for those interested in a Windows related riddle:

[00:00] <lizmat> Data::StaticTable  (a module without dependencies, let alone NativeCall)

[00:00] <lizmat> fails on Windows only with a failing dispatch: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Data-StaticTable/actions/runs/12341845341/job/34440975249

[00:02] <lizmat> fwiw, I cannot see anything Windows specific there that could explain the error (compared to being error free on Linux and MacOS)

[00:02] <lizmat> other than the compiler that was used to compile moar ?

[00:02] <lizmat> so maybe this is something for #moarvm

[23:55] <ugexe> wow, the gh-actions branch ive had in zef for like a year+ finally finishes to completion as of 2024.12

[23:56] <ugexe> i think it was a JIT related fix from over a month ago that fixed it, although the path length stuff did mean i was able to remove some workarounds in the workflow
