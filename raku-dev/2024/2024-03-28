[02:18] <MasterDuke> nine: any idea why 196fbee breaks the jvm build? i'm not seeing anything

[02:21] <MasterDuke> in a totally unrelated question. i noticed we have a couple instances of `if nqp::getcomp("Raku").backend.name eq '<foo>'` in rakudo. any reason those couldn't/shouldn't be turned into `#?if <foo>`?

[06:32] <nine> MasterDuke: my only guess is that the #?if mechanism came later. But I did not check that

[06:32] <tellable6> 2024-03-27T11:15:01Z #raku-dev <Xliff> nine Ah! Thanks for that... however that's going the wrong direction. I'm trying to have Raku share with C, not the other way around. So Raku originated String data needs to go to a (char *)

[06:32] <tellable6> 2024-03-27T11:15:16Z #raku-dev <Xliff> nine At any rate, it looks like the root-problem from 

[06:32] <tellable6> 2024-03-27T11:15:39Z #raku-dev <Xliff> nine At any rate, it looks like the root-problem for #5534 is the Raku-allocated structure. If C  allocates, the problem goes away.

[18:22] <jdv> looks like nqp build failed

[18:31] <jdv> seems to be related to the -j make option...

[18:31] <jdv> MasterDuke: around?

[18:45] <lizmat> jdv: sorry, was afk

[18:45] <lizmat> jdv: are you saying a clean rakudo won't build on Moar?

[18:46] <jdv> no.  'make' on nqp works fine.  'make -j $n' breaks.

[18:46] <jdv> This is because of a non-bumped nqp change that i bumped in today

[18:47] <jdv> trying to figure how important that change is and if there's an easy fix or to revert it

[18:47] <lizmat> so "make -j 8"  breaks?

[18:47] <jdv> yes

[18:48] <lizmat> make: *** No rule to make target `/Users/liz/Github/nqp/nqp-m', needed by `NQPP5QRegex.moarvm'.  Stop.

[18:48] <lizmat> make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

[18:48] <lizmat> +++ Setting up	nqp-m

[18:48] <lizmat> is what I'm seeing, you too ?

[18:49] <jdv> https://gist.github.com/jdv/2b5e3809caf364d3880a6f64eaf2604b

[18:49] <jdv> yup

[18:49] <lizmat> fwiw, I didn't know you could -j it

[18:50] <jdv> make?

[18:50] <lizmat> yeah

[18:50] <jdv> i'm a little confused why its broken but its been a while since i tried to read a real Makefile

[18:53] <lizmat> makefiles I try to stay away from :-)

[18:54] <jdv> any Makefile fans around?

[19:01] <jdv> I don't have time for this.  I'll just revert as it doesn't appear it was meant to unbreak anything...

[19:02] <jdv> MasterDuke: you'll have to fix it for real later
