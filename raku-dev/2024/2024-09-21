[06:10] <patrickb> At one point I've given up making Rakudo build in folders with spaces in their path - given that Rakudo itself is working when placed in a folder with spaces.

[09:11] <ab5tract> this morning I'm feeling like an evil genius >:)

[09:12] <ab5tract> I'm not sure whether there is any valid Raku grammar that is not valid NQP grammar

[09:13] <ab5tract> so I just passed the RakuLanguage instance to the NQPFileType constuctor and and BAM! NQP highlighting :D

[09:40] <ab5tract> it's not perfect (lots of issues when opening ClassHOW.nqp about it apparently not registering that definitions are inside of a class package), but it's definitely progess

[20:04] <timo> teaching diffoscope to read moar bytecode files and the dependencies in front of them

[20:07] <timo> may be a good idea to give moar an extended --dump that also spits out other sections of the file segmented logically so that a diff on the output makes more sense to spot differences
