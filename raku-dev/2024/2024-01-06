[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Was this question answered?  > what's up with JSON::Tiny - hasn't been updated in a while. Are we recommending ::Fast to people instead?

[22:24] <japhb> JSON::Fast is what most people should be using.  JSON::Tiny is useful as a demonstration of Raku features such as grammars, in a form that people can see actually *does something useful*.

[22:24] <japhb> But if you're doing a non-trivial amount of JSON work, you really want the extra speed of a highly tuned implementation.

[22:27] <lizmat> which reminds me to make a PR to put JSON::Fast in core
