[00:10] <timo> the "run full spec tests with spesh nodelay" takes almost exactly one hour

[00:18] <ugexe> i used to have a pipeline that ran spectest using prove. dunno if it would still work, or if you actually want to use prove 

[00:18] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/perl6-build-pipeline/blob/ca31e774fcf8a8a8a3d9fef1f7614ea5b111011b/Jenkinsfile#L72-L88

[00:24] <timo> can you tell me what the difference is between TAP::Formatter::JUnit and JUnitREGRU?

[00:26] <timo> there is apparently also TAP::Harness::JUnit

[00:28] <ugexe> if i remember correctly it was that something in jenkins (or maybe the variant of jenkins i was using, hudson) didn't support junit correctly

[00:28] <ugexe> ::Formatter and ::Harness are for different things

[00:35] <ugexe> looks like the main difference in related to encoding

[00:35] <timo> > The only difference between this module and TAP::Harness is that this module adds the optional arguments 'xmlfile', 'package', and 'namemangle' that cause the output to be formatted into XML in a format similar to the one that is produced by the JUnit testing framework.

[00:36] <timo> that's from TAP::Harness::JUnit

[00:36] <timo> TAP::Formatter::JUnit* is usable when you need JUnit output from a different TAP::Harness implementation, i imagine?

[00:39] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/azure_improvements: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3995f3b95e

[00:40] <ugexe> yeah im not sure. maybe it predated the plugin framework, or the author wasn't aware of the plugin framework? https://metacpan.org/pod/TAP::Harness#WRITING-PLUGINS seems to suggest writing a formatter makes sense

[00:42] <timo> right

[00:42] <timo> you know perl5 too right? i don't, so if you could hand-hold me for a brief moment i would appreciate it

[00:42] <ugexe> yeah

[00:44] <timo> cool. ok so i want to install TAP::Formatter::JUnit, but on the linux image when i "cpan install" that i get "if you answer no to the question below we set up everything for you automatically", is it safe to just `echo no | cpan install blabla`? on the windows runner instead i get "Can't locate CPAN/Author.pm in @INC (you may need to install the CPAN::Author module) [...]" but i think that's

[00:44] <timo> because i used "bash" instead of "pwsh" where i would get strawberry perl instead

[00:45] <ugexe> use cpanm instead

[00:45] <ugexe> ive used perl for a long time and i dont think i ever bothered figuring out 'cpan'

[00:47] <ugexe> i think some perl builds might just come with cpanm now? for example strawberry perl. but if not then yeah

[00:47] <timo> i'll give that a shot

[00:48] <timo> do you think there's a simple way to get the harness to also output special azure-compatible percentage-completion lines to stdout or stderr every minute or two or even every x lines?

[00:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/azure_improvements: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b08b1f1e64

[00:51] <ugexe> i'll see if i can find something, but my immediate search failed. i thought there was some ::Tee type plugin that allowed me to output tap to stdout while also saving JUnit to files that the CI system understood

[00:53] <timo> Successfully installed TAP-Formatter-JUnit-0.16

[00:53] <timo> 6 distributions installed

[00:53] <timo> there's an env var that outputs the raw tap stream into a file as well

[00:54] <timo> but that might only happen after the fact

[00:56] <timo> worst case, just piping the output from the reporter through a simple perl script that counts lines against the number of non-commented lines in the spectest.data file that's in use could be good enough

[01:06] <ugexe> yeah ::Formatter::JUnit

[01:13] <ugexe> btw with cpanm you don't use 'install'. so just `cpanm TAP::Formatter::JUnit` i believe

[01:17] <timo> oh ok thank you

[01:26] <ugexe> TAP::Formatter::JUnit also comes with a tap2junit command that can turn TAP into JUnit after the fact

[01:33] <timo> oh, that could be useful i think for the "make m-spectest" command that isn't set up to accept and pass on an argument for what formatter to create

[01:34] <ugexe> i would guess prove has environment variables for setting options

[01:34] <ugexe> "Default options may be set by specifying the PROVE_SWITCHES environment variable."

[01:36] <timo> it's a custom harness script, not using prove

[01:40] <ugexe> ah

[01:50] <timo> hm. so on the mac runner it's installed App::Cpanminus successfully, but doesn't tell me where, so "cpanm" after the installation results in "command not found"

[01:55] <timo> ! Installing the dependencies failed: Module 'Test::DiagINC' is not installed

[01:55] <timo> huh, what happened there

[01:56] <timo> "See /root/.cpanm/work/1726451316.1966/build.log for details" well that's long gone ...

[04:18] <ugexe> i think if you run with -v it will output whatever would be in build.log
