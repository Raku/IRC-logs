[02:55] <jdv> i ran blin on head (at the time earlier today - bea6188 and only Crane failed but now i can't try to repro that cause i can't seem to install zef on current head...

[02:57] <ugexe> My guess would be the recent flat changes 

[03:00] <jdv> lizmat: is that you?:)

[03:00] <jdv> ugexe: thanks

[03:00] <jdv> Crane's tests pass locally repeatedly.  looks like it hit a rando moar panic...

[12:37] <jdv> zef seems to install fine now

[12:37] <jdv> lizmat: thanks

[12:39] <lizmat> jdv: you mean installing zef itself from the repo, right?

[13:17] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[13:17] <notable6> lizmat, No notes for “weekly”

[13:49] <jdv> any idea what it is?

[13:50] <lizmat> nope, not yet

[13:51] <jdv> wait, is this with zef install or Crane tests?

[13:52] <lizmat> raku -I. bin/zef install .
