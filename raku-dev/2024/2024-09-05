[13:19] <[Coke]> up to 81.1% :P

[15:00] <[Coke]> 49 hours, 82.6%

[15:01] <[Coke]> Sorry, I realize no one wants this level of detail. :)

[15:02] <timo> https://salsa.debian.org/perl6-team/moarvm/-/merge_requests/4 i have this merge request that is clean except for a thing that is allowed to fail. i wonder what i need to do before i should bring it up to Dominique

[15:04] <timo> huh it says that lintian is unhappy about the changelog format but i thought i fixed it tho

[15:05] <timo> ah, got it

[15:07] <[Coke]> I made it to https://salsa.debian.org/timotimo-guest/moarvm/-/pipelines/726764/test_report but not seeing where the actual errors are.

[15:09] <timo> you click on "lintian", then for the moarvm and moarvm-dev categories there's a "view details" button on the right

[15:09] <timo> but the "failed jobs" tab near the top also has a snippet of build log output

[15:09] <timo> oh but that's unrelated

[15:11] <[Coke]> pre-existing condition?

[15:12] <[Coke]> oh, no, it *was* you. :)

[15:12] <timo> the moar package wasn't yet carefully set up to make cross-compilation possible, that's what the "allowed to fail" job is about

[15:13] <timo> the lintian errors are from my hand-writing the changelog entry with its date missing the seconds

[15:16] <timo> hm, no nmu in changelog, and source nmu has wrong version

[15:17] <timo> that's for when a non-maintainer makes a change, which i guess i am until i am put into the right file, and it's supposed to get a -nmu1 in that case

[15:20] <[Coke]> glad you were able to hit the ground running on this today!

[15:28] <timo> i'm not exactly sure if we're actually compiling with the flags that caused the error from the original bug

[15:30] <timo> To build with GCC 14, either set CC=gcc-14 CXX=g++-14 explicitly,

[15:30] <timo> or install the gcc, g++, gfortran, ... packages from experimental.

[15:30] <timo>   apt-get -t=experimental install g++ 

[15:30] <timo> ^- i guess i have to do that

[15:53] <timo> ok i think i'm confused

[15:58] <[Coke]> you got the tests to pass, anyway.

[16:00] <[Coke]> ah. some of the processes that are on for like 25 hours at this point appear to be hung tests on this blin run.

[16:01] <[Coke]> Wonder if that's why it slowed down. Guessing we should set a generous timeout "if your tests don't complete in 30m, mark it and move on."

[16:02] <timo> ok, so i think i was applying the fix to the wrong version

[16:07] <timo> the more i look at what i did the wronger it looks

[16:09] <[Coke]> heh

[16:09] <[Coke]> it seemed so reasonable. :)

[16:11] <timo> maybe i'm actually doing it half-correct. i just also need to start a new branch on top of the debian/2022.12+dfsg-1 tag where the patch also needs to go

[16:13] <timo> and i assume i have to transplant the change log entries from timeline-wise newer versions into the changes file, then add a new changelog entry for a lower version at the top

[16:23] <jdv> i only got some hung a few times in the dozens of runs ive down

[16:24] <[Coke]> I just killed anything that was 20+ hours old.

[16:24] <jdv> and i think it was because a large change in rakudo caused essentially a mem leak or something with a dist...

[16:24] <jdv> good times

[16:28] <timo> i forgot to put the patch in the patches/series file haha

[17:03] <timo> i guess i made that much more of an ordeal than it had to be

[17:44] *** sena_kun joined
[18:10] <[Coke]> so is the PR ready for his review at this point (saw the email but wasn't sure if that included everything)

[18:24] <timo> i believe that it is ready

[18:26] <timo> in order for getting moar off the track to expulsion, the branch mentioned in a comment in the merge request also needs to have someone go in and turn it into a debian package and upload it, is my understanding

[18:26] <timo> i think we can't just willy-nilly put a much newer version in an older debian release

[18:26] <timo> that's why i'm patching on top of previous releases

[18:27] <timo> getting latest upstream versions of moar, nqp, and rakudo out is a step later on the roadmap. these new versions have to go through maybe experimental before unstable, but definitely from unstable through the natural process of aging into stable and oldstable

[18:27] <timo> and testing is in between there also

[18:29] <timo> maybe i should verify with Dominique that this is actually accurate

[18:29] <timo> but for now, a nap

[18:40] <[Tux]> Today I upped a openSUSE 15.4 to 15.5. The most smooth upgrade ever! BUTâ€¦

[18:41] <[Tux]> Starting applications that used "advanced" unicode cause all kind of weird crashes!

[18:42] <[Tux]> I had to manually install libXft-newest from some non-standard repo to make the crashes go away

[18:42] <[Tux]> why is 15.5's libXft so "old"/incompatible with modern unicode?

[18:43] <[Tux]> I disable *a lot* of repo's off-standard this time in my upgrade to stay as close to standard as possibel

[18:44] <[Tux]> (another system is now updating from 15.4 to 15.6, I'm afraid to hit the same issue)

[18:45] <[Tux]> just 6053 packages to go before th next command
