[11:02] <patrickb> Test failure in 04-nativecall/11-cpp.t "Cannot locate symbol '?All_The_Things@Derived2@@UEAAJcFHJMNZ' in native library 'D:\a\1\source\rakudo-2024.05\11-cpp.dll'"

[11:03] <patrickb> I seem to remember having seen this error fly by in the IRC logs in the last few weeks. Does anyone remember?

[11:03] <lizmat> fwiw, doesn't fail for me

[11:03] <lizmat> on MacOS

[11:03] <patrickb> Yeah, MacOS and Linux are fine. This is a Windows only failure.

[11:05] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Do you remember?

[11:05] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[11:06] * patrickb is off to work again, will look at this again in the evening

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: rename ::Doc::Row to ::Doc::LegacyRow

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: As this object is only generated for the old, legacy style =table

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: that works by visual dividers in text, rather than with =row, =column

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: and =cell statements.

[11:31] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Added ::Doc::Row as a DEPRECATED subclass of ::Doc::LegacyRow for now

[11:53] <patrickb> lizmat: I think this is the commit that broke it:

[11:53] <patrickb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7766fbbd6e13d54ad011a1967c3fbc59e821f96c

[11:54] <patrickb> i.e. that's the commit where that specific error started showing up in the Windows CI tests.

[11:55] <lizmat> ok, please make an issue for it and assign it to me

[11:59] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: patrickbkr assigned to lizmat Issue Win NativeCall CPP "Cannot locate symbol" https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5587
