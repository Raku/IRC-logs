[13:56] <[Coke]> Do we need a doc test in rakudo/rakudo for the RAKUAST classes?

[13:57] <[Coke]> (something simple like "is this class in the .md file)

[14:25] <lizmat> not yet

[14:25] <lizmat> in the past weeks I created two more classes  :-)

[15:02] <[Coke]> I see some of the L10N module are copyright "Raku Localization Team" - I would recommend replacing that with an actual org like TRF (assuming they're OK with that)

[15:02] <[Coke]> I defer to codesections on that.

[15:04] <[Coke]> lizmat: L10N::EN has an example of L10::NL

[15:05] <[Coke]> (without an explanation, and the use L10N::EN is in NL). Might be worth just a sentence explaining the structure of the example.

[15:09] <Geth> ¦ L10N/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/L10N/commit/ac9aff7a5d

[15:10] <lizmat> fwiw, I wanted something else than myself there

[15:10] <lizmat> (re copyright)

[15:11] <lizmat> I specifically did not want to put TPRF there, as I feel that these localizations are independent of Rakudo

[15:14] <[Coke]> That's fair. I am nto a lawyer, it just seemed odd to have a not-actual org.

[15:16] <lizmat> there's a github "L10N Maintainers" team  :-)

[15:17] <[Coke]> Ok, I withdraw my concern. :)

[15:26] <lizmat> it only has one member as it stands, but still  :-)

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: Introduce nqp::track and nqp::guard

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: These are short-cuts for:

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main:   track('foo',…)  nqp::dispatch('boot-syscall', 'dispatcher-track-foo', …)

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main:   guard('foo',…)  nqp::dispatch('boot-syscall', 'dispatcher-guard-foo', …)

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: This should hopefully make the dispatcher setup code in core, as well

[17:24] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: as in Rakudo, a lot better readable.

[18:58] <librasteve> remembers how to use irssi (barely)

[18:59] * [Coke] has to google anything other than control-n. :)

[18:59] <librasteve> ++ decisions to close bridge to Discord and to moderate effectively

[19:02] <librasteve> i propose closing the raku-dev and moarvm-dev sub Discords to avoid anyone mistaking them fo the thing (maybe pin a transition notice)

[19:03] <gfldex> They can be made readonly on the discord side.

[19:12] <librasteve> hmmm - not sure - the other Disord channels remain and the mods are very lax ... I support (at least for now) keeping a Discord presence due to the ease of use and 

[19:14] <librasteve> ... general popularity, so keeping the beginner and vanilla raku-irc channels bridged makes sense ...

[19:16] <librasteve> ... but I think IRC only for the raku-dev, moar-dev channels is probably best rather than read only which feels a bit like the devs are more high and mighty 

[19:17] <gfldex> good point

[19:19] <librasteve> the raku-steering-council irc is there and bridged for community wide policy dissemination and debate for all
