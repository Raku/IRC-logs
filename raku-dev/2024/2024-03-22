[02:41] <MasterDuke> nine: i didn't realize you were working on a new BEGIN time lookup thing. i thought you'd already done a new one?

[02:41] <tellable6> 2024-03-19T08:21:14Z #raku-dev <lizmat> MasterDuke I guess JVM's nqp::istype doesn't like nqp::null as one of the arguments

[07:38] <nine> MasterDuke: current RakuAST main branch uses a fallback resolver for BEGIN time lookups. Last year it has become clear however that that strategy cannot win, e.g. because these BEGIN time compiled units will keep referencing a resolver which in turn keeps most of the objects we create during compilation alive.

[07:38] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to MasterDuke

[07:40] <nine> MasterDuke: so at the core summit jnthn and me went through the whole problem and came up with a better solution that basically boils down to doing all the lookups at compile time and compile them to constants. After all they cannot be affected by runtime behavior anyway.

[13:15] <ab5tract> nine: it's lovely to see this progress on the BEGIN lookups

[13:21] <ab5tract> when I looked at the commit which fixed NativeCall, I had such an "oh, _duh!_" moment

[20:00] <nine> Me, too :D Took me 3 attempts and in the end it was just such a tiny change. May have gotten a bit rusty.
