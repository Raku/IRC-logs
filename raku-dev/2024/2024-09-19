[21:08] <timo> good work on the optimizer bug. do we add a rakudo or spec test?

[21:25] <ab5tract> good question...

[21:26] <ab5tract> i guess it falls under rakudo

[21:29] <ab5tract> if it weren't already patched, we would put it in the with the misc rakuast tests

[21:30] <ab5tract> there's a few similar cases in there that pass only because of no spesh or no optimizer, the idea being that we don't just want to lose the proper behavior once we start integrating those

[22:03] <[Coke]> I think anything that is optimizer/jit/etc. related belongs in rakudo - but perhaps we should be running the spec test suite in multiple configurations also

[23:24] <timo> fascinating, the problem with "requested a synthetic codepoint that doesn't exist" also triggers on salsa for an i386 build

[23:24] <timo> i wonder if it has something to do with decoding the environment
