[08:13] <lizmat> gfldex: have you tried what you want to know?

[08:13] <gfldex> not yet

[08:14] <lizmat> please do: afaict all that is needed, is there already

[09:14] <lizmat> m: my $*FOO := "FOO"; await start { say $*FOO }   # all good

[09:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7ed824904: OUTPUT: «FOO␤»

[09:14] <lizmat> m: my $*FOO := "FOO"; await start { await start { say $*FOO } }   # but only one level deep  :-(

[09:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7ed824904: OUTPUT: «An operation first awaited:␤  in block  at <tmp> line 1␤␤Died with the exception:␤    Dynamic variable $*FOO not found␤      in block  at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:31] <lizmat> m: dd  (** + 4)(42)

[11:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7ed824904: OUTPUT: «(46,).Seq␤»

[11:31] <lizmat> m: dd  42.map(* + 4)    # TIL these are the same

[11:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7ed824904: OUTPUT: «(46,).Seq␤»

[11:52] <lizmat> FWIW, this is too much APL for me  :-)
