[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: Nano-optimize while loops

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: Instead of starting at -1 and always incrementing inside the check

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: (an optimization that turned out to be very useful in Raku), it

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: appears that this way ensure that there is 1 increment more than

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: really necessary.  And if there is no actual iteration possible,

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: this is relatively a lot.

[11:47] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: <…commit message has 10 more lines…>

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: Fix one refactor oopsie

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[11:58] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: That was sadly not caught by "make test"

[12:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[12:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Looks like it nibbles off 1 CPU second from spectest

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: some nano optimizations

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - use native ints where possible

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - don't bother initializing native ints if the value is 0

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - start loop counters at 0, instead of -1 + mandatory increment

[14:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - use prefix increment instead of postfix increment

[15:18] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Some nano optimizations in dispatchers

[15:18] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[15:18] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Actually, these probably won't make any difference, but at least

[15:18] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: will make the code consistent in the aspect of writing loops and

[15:18] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: use of ints as flags.
