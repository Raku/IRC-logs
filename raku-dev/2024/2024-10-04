[12:54] <lizmat> 100 issues closed since I started working through them in reverse order  :-)

[13:28] <tbrowder> very good!

[13:28] <timo> impressive

[13:34] <tbrowder> now, how can i as a user completely shut off precompilation? setting the env var RAKUDO_NO_PRECOMPILATION seems not to work

[13:37] <tbrowder> i manually blow away the .precomps but they come back. i have set it in my shell before running and the .precomp comes back

[13:38] <tbrowder> using ver 2024.09 on debian

[13:38] <lizmat> ugexe?

[13:41] <timo> this is with using -I. everywhere, right?

[13:51] <tbrowder> i've filed an issue.

[13:53] <tbrowder> um, i have set the shell env, but the module does use precompiled modules from other

[13:53] <tbrowder> sources

[13:57] <tbrowder> and i have used : raku -I. ./prog to no avail

[13:59] <timo> the "steps to reproduce" are a little vague still, but i'll have a look what's up

[13:59] <tbrowder> i can't find the thread but someone earlier suggested setting one of the phasers to not run somehow. may have been @ugexe ...

[14:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: string specifification, instead of to an absolute path.  Since

[14:02] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: the method was using Str() coercion, it's handling re IO::Path
