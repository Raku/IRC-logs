[15:58] <MasterDuke> man, JSON::Fast really isn't all that fast. it took python 3.11 8s to open a 10m line (770mb) json file and print the last entry, JSON::Fast hadn't even finished parsing the file after 13min

[15:59] <lizmat> I'm open to suggestions to make it faster  :-)

[16:00] <lizmat> it's basically all nqp already

[16:00] <lizmat> note that if the top level is an array, then https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/JSON::Fast::Hyper might be something to look at

[16:01] <MasterDuke> well, just slurping the file with `:enc<ascii>` takes 12.5s

[16:02] <lizmat> NFG comes at a price, even with :enc<ascii>

[16:03] <MasterDuke> python's `json.load()` takes a filehandle, that might be nice for JSON::Fast so you don't have to slurp the whole file into memory first

[16:07] <MasterDuke> huh.a perf profile of just slurping the file shows 41% of the time spent in the kernel's `clear_page_rep`. i kind of want to restart to get the most recent kernel update, but my usb wireless adapter's module failed to build, so i'll lose network connectivity if i do...

[16:10] <MasterDuke> changing the subject, i wonder if day 3 of the advent calendar could have used `.kxxv`

[16:11] <lizmat> possibly  :-)

[22:24] <jdv> also, discord bot person - could we shorten the "nick/name"?  its a bit long.
