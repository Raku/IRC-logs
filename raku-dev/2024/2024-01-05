[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> How much deprecated is Build.pm actually?

[15:09] <lizmat> ugexe might know

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also, do modules default to META6 language version now?

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I remember the plans

[16:18] <ugexe> we don'

[16:19] <ugexe> we don't recommend using Build.pm in new code, but realistically there is so much existing code using it that its hard to say when we should start nagging users in like zef output

[16:22] <ugexe> and no, modules don't default to META6.json language versions

[16:23] <lizmat> we *could* do that relatively easy with RakuAST?

[16:23] <lizmat> but only if it is a "raku" entry in the META6 ?

[16:24] <lizmat> I mean, it would be one less thing to keep in sync

[16:26] <ugexe> i'm not sure how it would be relatively easy. it took vrurg a ton of work to implement something similar for ver/auth/api, and even with all that work it isn't considered quite yet ready by myself or niner.

[16:27] <ugexe> im not sure if that is something RakuAST can make easier or not, so maybe i'm wrong though

[16:28] <lizmat> I see it like: if there's no "use v6.x" at the start of the compunit, and there is a META6. act as if "use %META<raku>" specified

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> bummer

[16:30] <ugexe> how do you get %META?

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what file extensions are available for this legacy builder script?

[16:31] <ugexe> .pm, .pm6, .rakumod

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> thanks

[16:32] <lizmat> ugexe: good question, I would have to look that up  :-)

[16:58] <[Coke]> We could add a blin test and start reporting out modules which have a Build.pm

[16:58] <[Coke]>  /Build.rakudoc

[16:59] <[Coke]> I am using it in raku/doc right now to stop people from trying to install it. Is there a better way to do that?

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> haha, clever

[19:07] <vrurg> ugexe: as to "where to get %META from" â€“ I did solve it somehow back then. Though don't remember how I did it. Partially, it was about passing the info through environment variables from compiler to compiler.
