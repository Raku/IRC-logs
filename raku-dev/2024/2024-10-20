[13:40] <ab5tract> open tickets for rakudo is less than 800 :O

[13:40] <ab5tract> well done lizmat!

[13:40] <lizmat> at 747 atm...  scary

[13:40] <ab5tract> though I thought we were keeping "Fixed in RakuAST" tickets open until after 6.e?

[13:41] <lizmat> well, I sorta unilaterally decided that if there's a test, it can be closed

[13:41] <ab5tract> so that people who encountered the issue would be more likely to find it and therefore not re-open tickets

[13:42] <ab5tract> okay :)

[13:42] <lizmat> there's that argument...  

[13:43] <lizmat> but in reality I don't think that will happen as much as we'd hoped for  :-(

[13:48] <lizmat> ab5tract: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5446 appears fixed

[13:49] <lizmat> do you think that needs a test?  Or does it fall out of passing spectest as the result of the fix?

[13:50] <ab5tract> I think it must be covered by tests already

[13:50] <lizmat> ok, closed it  :-)

[13:50] <ab5tract> Hard to say for certain but I would expect that to be the case

[18:14] <jdv> lizmat: do you know anything about https://github.com/jnthn/p6-io-socket-async-ssl/issues/77 ?

[18:15] <jdv> i thought that was fixed a while ago but i just ran into it again

[18:16] <lizmat> I don't think the underlying issue was fixed >?

[18:16] <lizmat> I recall updating IRC::Client to work around it ?

[18:17] <jdv> ah, maybe that was what i was misremembering then

[18:18] <jdv> what would be a way forward on that one?

[18:19] <lizmat> you have IRC::Client 4.0.12 ?

[18:20] <jdv> i installed the older one that's mentioned in one of those tickets which got me past the install 

[18:20] <lizmat> 4.0.12  2024-08-31T20:30:02+02:00

[18:20] <lizmat>     - Bump version of IO::Socket::Async::SSL, and make it accept any

[18:20] <lizmat>       future versions as well, to prevent clashes with e.g. Whateverable

[18:20] <jdv> but now on running blin it errors out, presumably that's precomp

[18:24] <jdv> i believe that's what i tried first, whatever zef found.  i'll try again.

[19:17] <jdv> i'll look into that

[19:24] <jdv> hmm, why doesn't Whateverable show up on raku.land?

[21:20] <timo> i guess i probably shouldn't put my stuff into moar's main branch just before the release huh
