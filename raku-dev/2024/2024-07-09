[19:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: the :unsafe name argument must be added.  Nudged by patrickb++

[22:22] <patrickb> lizmat: Just so I understand correctly: Without :unsafe the highlighter won't see "use" and similar constructs and bail on the first unknown symbol? So this won't be usable as a general "highlight this raku file" thing, right?

[22:22] <lizmat> ah, good point: I forgot to short-cut "use"

[22:24] <lizmat> but yes, unless you are sure of the code in question, I wouldn't use it with :unsafe on just any file

[22:24] <lizmat> the main goal was to be able to create syntax highlighting for code examples in the documentation

[22:25] <lizmat> without needing to resort to non-Raku solutionns

[22:25] <patrickb> lizmat: If you manage to pull this off and create a usable raku highlighter in Raku, you earn my deep respect.

[22:26] <lizmat> you mean for documentation?    consider it pulled off  :-)

[22:26] <lizmat> anyways, late here, long hot day, time for sleep&
