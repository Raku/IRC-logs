[01:04] <jdv> dan sugalski, parrot peep

[01:04] <jdv> oh, thanks will

[06:40] <ab5tract> Dang, the post mortem is 404

[08:50] <ab5tract> ugexe: is there a way to ensure that zef uses the raku tree it was installed with instead of the raku tree in the path?

[08:50] <ab5tract> https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/77bbce7e71418a027cb3e0eb2be4758f

[08:51] <ab5tract> The script works as expected but invoking `.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.02/install/share/perl6/site/bin/zef locate Time::Crontab` responds with a file installed at `.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.08/install/share/perl6/site/sources/AF7B5BB0DFEECDDF6640F50E7AC66F120A8776D8`

[08:58] <ab5tract> this also means that `zef install Foo` is a no-op when it is installed for `moar-2024.08` even though I'm trying to install it for `moar-2024.02`

[09:09] <ab5tract> I've just checked and unfortunately nothing changes even when I specify the config path relative to the correct version with `--config-path` 

[09:09] <ab5tract> I would prefer not to do anything with the environment

[15:12] <jdv> changelogs are up.  i'll wait an hour or so before starting the releases.

[15:12] <jdv> lizmat: ^

[15:13] <[Coke]> jdv++

[15:20] <ugexe> ab5tract: I'm not immediately sure how that could happen 🤔 As far as I remember anything (zef or raku internals) invoking raku would be using $*EXECUTABLE. and the paths where modules are installed/listed is determined by the raku ($*EXECUTABLE) used to invoke zef itself

[15:21] <ugexe> oh

[15:21] <ugexe> i bet the bin shim raku installs does like #!/usr/bin/env raku or something

[15:22] <ugexe> so zef is getting invoked with whatever raku that would use

[15:23] <ugexe> .rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.02/install/raku .rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.02/install/share/perl6/site/bin/zef

[15:23] <ugexe> something like that should work though

[15:25] <ugexe> if you want something shorter you could also do like

[15:26] <ugexe> .rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.02/install/raku -MZef::CLI -e '' locate Time::Crontab

[15:28] <ugexe> with https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/80 it would be even more convient

[15:37] <jdv> ab5tract: https://www.sidhe.org/oldblog/archives/000435.html

[15:37] <jdv> just a url change

[15:41] <lizmat> jdv: looking at the changelog now

[15:42] <ab5tract> ugexe: that makes total sense

[15:42] <ab5tract> though this isn't installed with the shim raku

[15:47] <ab5tract> the -MZef::CLI works like a charm :)

[15:47] <ab5tract> though I'll stick to my script for the purposes of locate as I want JSON output

[15:48] <ab5tract> parsing in Java is a yuck fest

[15:50] <ab5tract> btw, if `zef` is installed in a RO directory like `/usr/...`, will it automagically install into a user-writable location like `/home/...`?

[15:58] <lizmat> jdv: done with the changelog

[15:59] <ugexe> ab5tract: the path you listed is certainly a shim because it isnt a sha1 basename

[15:59] <ugexe> if you `cat ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.02/install/share/perl6/site/bin/zef` or whatever you'll see as much

[16:00] <ab5tract> Ah, I see what you mean. I was referring to the fact that I used a non-shimmed raku to install it

[16:01] <ab5tract> So I was talking about rakubrew shims and I believe you are speaking of a zef provided shim

[16:01] <ugexe> yeah, although the shim is provided by rakudo itself

[16:02] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/2750112c088680c0d5f90b2b0cbcea23f0244b46/src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/Installation.rakumod#L33-L36

[16:02] <ab5tract> Hmm.. then maybe we cans make it use it’s absolute path instead of whatever it’s doing now

[16:03] <ugexe> im not sure if that is the right thing to do either tho

[16:04] <ugexe> there is relocatable raku, plus im not sure that a CURI should be tied to a specific installation of rakudo or not. remember one can install stuff to a custom location which could be used by any rakudo via e.g RAKULIB

[16:05] <ab5tract> Good point..

[16:06] <ab5tract> Maybe a configuration flag would be reasonable

[16:07] <ab5tract> Or else making the shared CURI be more of a default experience

[16:07] <jdv> lizmat: thanks

[16:08] <ab5tract> Because I’ve never had the experience when installing a new Raku version of having my existing third party stuff available

[16:08] <ab5tract> Which, if it works, why not?

[16:09] <ugexe> zef install Foo --install-to='~/foo/bar' and then RAKULIB="~/foo/bar"

[16:09] <ab5tract> That is absolutely too much work :)

[16:10] <ugexe> the other thing is the default experience will generally be catered to a typical user, not a developer of the core. most users do not have multiple rakudos installed, and would generally be best served by default that avoid any caveats to the aforementioned shared repo

[16:12] <ugexe> for example there is a concept of repository version for when e.g. the layout of the files is changed, and which rakudo will "migrate" to a new version upon install if a new version is introduced. any old rakudo that does not know the new format would then break trying to use that repository

[16:12] <ab5tract> Fair enough. Thanks for making Zef so usable from Raku itself. I can put away my concerns for the shims and move on to pushing the Zef support in Comma

[16:14] <ugexe> actually i lied, there is an easier way to do it (although caveats still apply)

[16:15] <ugexe> set https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/45f3ac7624ea3388e334e756e32fb3a48ef6098a/resources/config.json#L5 to home, or set ZEF_INSTALL_TO=home, or pass zef --install-to=home

[16:16] <ugexe> 1 bin/ script [zef] installed to:

[16:16] <ugexe> /Users/nlogan/.raku/bin

[16:16] <ugexe> raku -e 'say $*REPO.repo-chain.head'

[16:16] <ugexe> inst#/Users/nlogan/.raku

[16:17] <ugexe> the "home" repo is at the head of every raku installation and isn't tied to a specific version

[16:18] <ugexe> we actually did use to default to the "home" repo I think, but switched away due to problems such as the caveat I listed earlier

[16:20] <ugexe> also since you mentioned comma... you don't *have* to install zef, you could just run it from a shared cloned repo

[16:32] <ugexe> i guess a drawback of using environment variables like ZEF_INSTALL_TO= though is that they are consumed in Zef::CLI not Zef::Client or Zef::Config so your example code would not end up using it

[16:32] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/45f3ac7624ea3388e334e756e32fb3a48ef6098a/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod#L429

[16:34] <ugexe> i guess ideally Zef::Config should be rewritten to handle the environment variable stuff and provide methods for accessing the final config value of things including env stuff instead of just returning a hash of what is in the config file itself and handling the environment variable stuff at a call site

[16:35] <ugexe> in that way the existing Zef::Config might be better thought of as Zef::ConfigFile

[16:37] <ab5tract> since my experience was that `Zef::Config` worked exactly the way I expected/wanted, I'm a bit ambivalent about all that

[16:38] <ab5tract> but maybe I will indeed look into using a shared repo eventually

[16:39] <ab5tract> but probably won't be adopting a shared CURI unless there is a strong demand for it

[16:39] <ab5tract> it can be useful to switch between Rakudo "SDK" installations specifically because you want to compare how two diverging versions of a module behave

[16:42] <ab5tract> or maybe this is case of me feeling "I just put this bucket of bolts back together, I'm not going to let anything tear it apart" :)

[16:44] <ab5tract> ugexe: do you find yourself using `-e''` very often? It makes me wonder whether a `-x` or similar might be appreciated by more people than just myself

[16:47] <lizmat> I have an alias: r='time raku -e'

[16:47] <lizmat> and I use that *very* often

[16:47] <ugexe> ab5tract: i think i primarily find myself using it when i dont want to set PATH to whatever/perl6/install/site

[16:48] <ugexe> although i only ever use `-e ''` in combination with `-MZef::CLI` (or -e 'use Zef::CLI')

[16:52] <ugexe> if im remember correctly i found avoiding having to set PATH useful on windows or windows ci systems where I dont want to be bothered figuring out how to set the env vars or to determine the CURI bin directory to set PATH to begin with

[21:10] * ab5tract finally recognizes that patch

[21:11] <ab5tract> it's a shame it didn't fully cover this scenario, because otherwise I loved the idea of moving back to Raku from NQP in Rakudo

[21:14] <jdv> i'm sure she can fix it later, just need it fixed now or out.

[21:15] <jdv> there's been a bunch of that work in the past - i'm a fan 

[21:30] <ab5tract> indeed, I said it all in the spirit of its eventual return :)
