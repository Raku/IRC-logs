[18:45] <[Coke]> In general, we don't remove old versions from the ecosystem, yes? on CPAN, I could delete an old version (or honestly, all versions) - is there a plan to support it at some point in future? (maybe based on major version, so if we're at 2.x, we could get rid of all but-supported 1.x?)

[19:26] <ab5tract> lizmat: the conversation on the related issue was the feature in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/194206736f was actually the wrong way to go :(

[21:46] *** finanalyst left
[21:47] <ugexe> the only time i would hope an ecosystem would allow removing an old version is if it has been found to contain malicious code. it *might* be acceptable to remove something that nothing else depends on, but due to us allowing multiple ecosystems that isn't really an option since all ecosystems would need to be integrated with each other

[21:48] <ugexe> for example i might have a private ecosystem with my private modules that depends on something from e.g. cpan

[21:48] <ugexe> in perl if you deleted something from cpan it would still be on backpan i believe. similar to in raku if you delete something from cpan it will still be on REA

[21:51] <ugexe> [Coke]: ^

[22:30] <lizmat> ab5tract: so you'd want 194206736f to be reverted?
