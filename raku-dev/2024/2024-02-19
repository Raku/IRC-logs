[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Better errors for common array parameter mistakes

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: These are mistakes that beginners make a lot, so try to help them out.

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The two particular cases I'm thinking of are something like:

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: `sub a(Array @b) { dd @b }; my @c = 1, 3; a(@c)`

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: where they forgot or didn't realize that the `@` sigil on the parameter

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: already implied an array.

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: and

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: `sub a(Int @b) { dd @b }; my @c = 1, 3; a(@c)`

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: where they forgot or didn't realize that Raku's types are nominal, i.e.,

[11:41] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: they need to be be explicitly declared, they aren't just inferred.

[15:57] <finanalyst> ison @lizmat

[15:57] <finanalyst> .ison @lizmat

[15:58] <finanalyst> ISON @lizmat

[16:01] <jdv> finanalyst: you ok?;)

[16:01] <finanalyst> @jdv: I'm fine. But I really do not know IRC. I feel like a dynasaur

[16:03] <jdv> wut is ison?

[16:08] <finanalyst> I looked up IRC commands to find how to see if someone was on line. ISON is given in Wikipedia

[16:09] <finanalyst> Eventually found `/msg`

[16:10] <lizmat> a good IRC client will help you with a lot of that  :-)

[16:12] <finanalyst> @lizmat: hi. Sorry for the noise

[16:12] <jdv> @ is for twitter

[16:12] <jdv> :)

[16:13] <finanalyst> jdv: thank you. I'm still an email person.

[16:13] <[Coke]> You get used to it. :)

[16:13] <lizmat> jdv's reply reminded me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoPXQ9fotZM

[16:13] <jdv> finanalyst: cool:)

[16:14] <[Coke]> My biggest IRC problem was trying to run it from my laptop - ended up running a tmux session elsewhere so I can leave it up all the time and then remote into that box and tmux to catch up with whatever I missed

[16:14] <finanalyst> any suggestions for a good IRC client. I'm using HexChat

[16:14] <[Coke]> The discord bridge is not bad if you are used to discord.

[16:14] <[Coke]> I'm using irssi (text based mac client)

[16:15] <lizmat> I use Textual on MacOS and am very happy with it  :-)

[16:15] <[Coke]> well, *on* mac it's not mac specific.

[16:15] <finanalyst> I think I have a discord account, but I haven't used it much

[16:17] <finanalyst> Textual seems to be MacOS specific

[16:17] <jdv> i use irssi in gnu screen but i get im not the norm

[16:17] <finanalyst> Also I am offline and away from the laptop for significant periods of time

[16:18] <jdv> whatever works:)
