[09:14] <ab5tract> Perhaps unsurprisingly, I support deprecating flatmap. I think it’s a confuso to have a map candidate that doesn’t affect the actual map operation but instead affects the result of the map

[19:48] <lizmat> meh: finally thought I'd have ParaSeq ready for some real action

[19:49] <lizmat> turns out it cannot live in a pre-compiled module yet :-(

[19:50] <lizmat> unsupported lexical type uint64

[19:55] <lizmat> changed all uints to ints, and the problem goes away :-(

[20:05] <ab5tract> :(

[20:07] <lizmat> it's not using uint in an attribute declaration

[20:07] <lizmat> will look at it tomorrow, afk&
