[18:44] <ab5tract> totally broken

[18:49] <ab5tract> uniprop should really be returning a Uniprop object

[18:49] <ab5tract> but that would be a major overhaul

[19:06] <ab5tract> just to bring it home...

[19:19] <nine> There you have it. "A" is a myth!

[19:20] <nine> All this time THEY just wanted you to believe that A exists!

[19:22] <ab5tract> lmao

[19:23] <gfldex> Are you trying to tell me, that the A-Team wasn't real‽

[19:52] <ab5tract> most of these general category jaunts are just... why? or maybe more importantly, what??

[21:52] <ab5tract> got it fixed
