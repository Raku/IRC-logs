[12:11] <ab5tract> What’s the test count up to in that branch?

[12:25] <nine> 1058

[12:25] <nine> -7+2 compared to main

[12:40] <ab5tract> so close!

[12:40] <ab5tract> congratulations on making such swift work on that

[14:26] <ab5tract> going to migrate $!mode to the NQPFileHandle

[14:52] <lizmat> nine: re 2cba37f5c4101d39f2fd , don't we have a similar issue in NQP ?

[14:52] <linkable6> (2024-05-12) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2cba37f5c4 Fix mysterious failures when class construction process order changes

[14:56] <nine> lizmat: I guess we'd have noticed by now

[14:56] <lizmat> yeah.. well hidden bugs...  could be too well hidden

[14:57] <lizmat> I guess the answer is really: possibly, but unlikely ?

[15:03] <nine> yep

[15:10] <lizmat> ok, will investigate later this week

[15:14] <ab5tract> came across this and couldn't help wonder if it could be related as well: R#1419

[15:14] <linkable6> R#1419 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1419 A simple change of `use` ordering causes a surprising breakage

[15:16] <nine> Sounds more like global merging insanity

[15:46] <ab5tract> figured it was a long shot, but thought I'd mention it

[15:59] <lizmat> notable6: weekly
