[20:33] <timo> that's apparently unrelated to the problem i'm seeing

[20:46] *** finanalyst joined
[20:50] <timo> so, here's build outputs of some of the involved packages with RMD output, plus a summary of what i think is going wrong at the top: https://gist.github.com/timo/aec874bd7843b7cac06e0caaec3a0583 

[20:52] <timo> in short, when building one package, it's complaining that it can't find one dependency of a package it's loading (in other words, a transitive dependency), and then it precompiles that transitive dependency's source anew, and it becomes part of the new package, and because it's the same file in two different packages now, they cannot be installed at the same time

[20:52] <timo> but in the RMD output you can see that package being loaded, then later it says it can't find that package

[21:07] *** sena_kun joined
[22:28] <ugexe> timo: re :since I think the answer is it is unused now. see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ff4a034dd2cf37f6e56e34396851a0f3062a210c

[23:01] *** sena_kun left

[23:20] <timo> ah nice. there used to be a patch applied to debian's rakudo that turned > into >= so that the same time stamp would be acceptable as well, not just a strictly greater one

[23:21] <timo> but yeah, i realized a little later that the thing that caused re-precompilation here was the inability to find the dependency, and not the timestamp or checksum
