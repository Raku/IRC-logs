[02:06] <MasterDuke> well, this is fascinating. 7cd05bb452015ad20f378723d931e5c5b28b4797 broke the jvm build in the same way that 7ebf82ed7d5d63d8fee1c7539ae5a7824d890e5b did

[02:06] <linkable6> (2024-03-13) https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/7cd05bb452 Add nqp::const::TYPE_CHECK_xxx constants

[02:06] <linkable6> (2024-03-06) https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/7ebf82ed7d Add nqp::const::TYPE_NATIVE_(INT|NUM|STR|UINT|MASK)

[02:07] <MasterDuke> in 7e it was adding entries to a hash literal, so it was changed to nqp::bindkey them instead. that worked to add a few, but now adding three more causes it to die again

[02:15] <MasterDuke> huh. that hash only has 197 keys. how is 200 too much?

[02:19] <MasterDuke> you can create a hash and add more than 200 keys on the jvm backend. so why not there?

[02:23] <MasterDuke> oh. interestingly, those values were already in the hash...

[02:25] <MasterDuke> ha, added 11 years ago 3b9cb865fecbe798f7a0418413fbd4264288dec2

[02:25] <linkable6> (2013-10-21) https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/3b9cb865fe Add nqp::consts for the TYPE_CHECK_* family of constants.

[02:31] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: Don't need to add TYPE_CHECK_* constants to JVM backend

[02:31] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: 

[02:31] <Geth> ¦ nqp/main: They were already added in 3b9cb865fecbe798f7a0418413fbd4264288dec2.
