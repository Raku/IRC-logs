[20:41] <patrickb> I'm curious, is ^ a second persona of timo?

[21:03] <[Coke]> given that they speak to each other on the PR, I doubt it?

[21:27] <patrickb> Interesting. I'd really like to get to know them. It seems they, timo and I share a common interest in the debugger. I'll go ask!

[22:15] <ab5tract> so I'm *this* close to having a revision-gated resolution to the `&infix:<!=>` + junctions conundrum

[22:16] <ab5tract> haven't tried to revision gate the `METAOP_NEGATE` side of things, but that one was super simple to address

[22:16] <ab5tract> Instead of `-> |c { c.elems > 1 ?? !op.(|c) !! True }` ...

[22:17] <ab5tract> use ` -> |c { c.elems > 1 ?? op.(op.(|c), False) !! True }` instead
