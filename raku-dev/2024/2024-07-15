[22:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: When mixing binary and non-binary accesses, the data is put into an

[22:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: encoder for decoded accesses. It's possible that not all data that was

[22:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: added to the decoder is read. Subsequent binary reads would miss the

[22:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: in binary accesses should one be set.
