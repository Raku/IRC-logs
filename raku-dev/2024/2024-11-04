[21:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/setthreadname: Don't try to use setthreadname on JVM yet

[21:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/setthreadname: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/292515295f

[21:39] <timo> anybody got opinions on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5674 "when starting a Thread, also set its thread name"? the commit above makes it not explode on jvm any more

[21:39] <timo> (compiler said setthreadname is not registered)

[22:24] <coleman> timo: I don't know if this is exactly prior art, but here is a link to Erlang's categories; https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_cmd.html#+sct

[22:24] <coleman> Threads are one level in the so-called "CpuTopology"

[22:25] <coleman> Now that seems to be more about the runtime than the compiler, but compilers have runtimes, too

[22:26] <coleman> Just use that as inspiration. Regarding your actual commits? I defer to others.

[22:29] <ab5tract> timo: seems like a perfectly reasonable PR to me

[23:08] <timo> coleman: i'm not sure i can get anything from that, at least for this feature
