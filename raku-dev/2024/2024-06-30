[17:02] <tbrowder> how do i publish the updated community module?

[17:04] <ugexe> two things

[17:05] <ugexe> one: i wouldnt make a new release for the items you added. the source-url gets replaced by the fez one, and the other commits appear only ci stuff which has no connection to a released distribution as far as any consumers are concerned

[17:05] <ugexe> two: the source-url you committed is wrong - it 404s

[17:08] <tbrowder> 1 - ok, i’ll ck again, thnx

[17:19] <tbrowder> ok, confused again. is the fez path and github different with some magic refirect?

[17:21] <tbrowder> so for purposes of dist.ini, what should the source-url entry be?

[17:24] <[Coke]> e.g.   "source-url": "git://github.com/coke/raku-uni.git",

[17:24] <[Coke]> Er, sorry, that's META6.json

[17:34] <ugexe> fez will replace the source-url. for your github repo you can indeed list the github url as the source-url, but my point was it doesnt make sense to cut a new release when you change that

[17:35] <ugexe> but whatever source-url you do put should be an actual url that works and not a 404

[17:36] <ugexe> so change the source-url to https://github.com/raku-community-modules/MIME-Base64

[17:36] <ugexe> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/MIME-Base64.git rather

[17:37] <ugexe> and again, i wouldnt bother making a release for that change. there is no reason to do so

[18:41] <tbrowder> well, the point is to be able to see the separate badges per os type. if it doesn’t get published i don’t think they can be seen on raku.land

[18:42] <tbrowder> anyhoo, i’ll fix the link…give me a few.
