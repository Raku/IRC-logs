[12:39] <finanalyst> [Coke] I've addressed your issue on the  Collection repo. Its messy, I'm afraid.

[13:04] <[Coke]> OK - Collection is being used as part of doc-website, yes? All those extra steps means I cannot run it on mac (or probably windows)

[18:16] <finanalyst> So I need to remove it from Build

[18:16] <finanalyst> The aim was to make doc-website independent of other plugins. 

[18:18] <finanalyst> [Coke] Did you only clone the doc-website repo?

[20:16] <finanalyst> .tell [Coke] Collection does not clone app data on install any more. this is not required for doc-website.

[20:16] <tellable6> finanalyst, I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[20:22] <[Coke]> I cloned doc-website, but Collection is a dependency. I
