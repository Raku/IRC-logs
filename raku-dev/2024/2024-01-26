[09:14] <gfldex> Do we track startup time of Rakudo?

[09:24] <lizmat> not really...I track spectest times for myself, which consists of startup to a large extent

[09:26] <lizmat> 211 seconds (CPU 1350 secs)  on my M1, with 1357 is about 150 seconds of startup

[09:41] <gfldex> My backup-script is starting up faster. But there have been a few goodies for NUMAs in recent Linux versions.

[09:43] <lizmat> I did some opts in dispatchers...

[21:33] <jdv> patrickb: the 2024.01 release happened

[21:34] <jdv> .tell El_Che the 2024.01 release happened

[21:34] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[21:34] <jdv> commit away.  afk.

[22:22] <vrurg> BTW, my patch for MoarVM to write-protect VMHash has already paid off.

[22:22] <jdv> how much?

[22:22] <jdv> and at what cost?

[22:23] <jdv> hash perf is not unimportant

[22:24] *** kjp left
[22:24] <vrurg> I didn't measure the cost, but in neither way it is supposed to be the default. Only when `#if MOARVM_HASH_PROTECT`.

[22:24] <vrurg> It's purely a debug thing.

[22:25] <vrurg> But it let me to pinpoint unprotected mangling of %!mro on Metamodel::C3MRO.

[22:25] <jdv> oh

[22:25] <japhb_> \o/

[22:25] <japhb_> Go vrurg!

[22:25] *** japhb_ is now known as japhb

[22:25] <japhb> Gah, I wonder when my nick did a fallback

[22:26] <vrurg> The only thing – it only assured me that the patch needs to be merged, though it most definitely requires some polishing first.
