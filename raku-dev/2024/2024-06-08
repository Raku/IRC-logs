[10:49] <lizmat> in the WTF dept:  turns out that removing the "our" from:

[10:49] <lizmat> our proto sub last(|) is export {*}

[10:49] <lizmat> fixes the issue

[10:50] <lizmat> how that has to  do with an unsupported lexical type is beyond me, at least atm

[10:51] <lizmat> however, it *is* somehow also linked to uints, as replacing all of them with ints also made the issue go away

[12:05] <ab5tract> Hmm.. I remember seeing an issue about our used in conjunction with export

[12:12] <ab5tract> R#5495
