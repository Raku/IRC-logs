[12:42] <tbrowder__> hi

[12:42] <tbrowder__> hi

[12:42] <lizmat> tbrowder__ o/

[12:43] <tbrowder__> i can’t see my msg here :-( my irc foo is bad

[12:44] <lizmat> I saw two "hi"s 

[12:44] <tbrowder__> ok, that’s good to know

[12:48] <tbrowder__> and i cannot get rid of underscores on user name

[12:49] <lizmat> feels like logging out and loggin in again should fix that?

[12:49] <lizmat> I don't see any other tbrowderxxx logged in?

[12:50] <tbrowder__> it’s my irc client at some level, help is on the way

[13:18] * lizmat just realizes that there is already an "exact invocant" functionality in dispatch

[13:19] <lizmat> so that we only syntax to allow this

[14:20] <jdv>  its not something like "/nick $nick" or whatever?

[14:28] <[Coke]> 09:27 -!- Nick tbrowder is already in use

[14:28] <[Coke]> on this IRC server, they are reserved and unique. This is why I'm [Coke] and not Coke.

[14:29] <[Coke]> I was too slow to get to libera before the fake Coke did. :)

[14:30] <jdv> i squatted the 3 chans first i think and i got jdv before that.  i was bored at $work iirc:)
