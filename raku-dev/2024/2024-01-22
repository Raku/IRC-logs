[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Handle .extension("foo") on IOs without extension differently (#5512)

[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Before this commit, "foo".IO.extension("bar") would return "foo".IO

[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: instead of the probably expected "foo.bar".IO.  To get that behaviour

[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: one needs to specify :parts(0) as well.  Which, at least to me, was

[11:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: a bit of a WAT.

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <22/3>), then rakufy as a vulgar: 7¹/₃ instead of <22/3> if the

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST grammar is being used.  The RakuAST grammar allows vulgars

[11:09] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: such as  7¹/₃ to represent <22/3>, so roundtripping is ensured.

[14:37] <japhb> lizmat: Regarding f5e9b2dcad -- that made me go look at the definition of <vulgar>, and it occurs to me that along with U+2F (SOLIDUS), it should also accept U+2044 (FRACTION SLASH).
