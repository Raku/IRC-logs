[13:15] <lizmat> ab5tract: done for now

[13:17] <ugexe> Do you ever use an IDE? You’d probably never find that useful if you don’t 

[13:20] <ugexe> I like that in many languages I can hover something and get a blurb about it. Regular documentation can sometimes fill that role but for e.g. private functions or lexical variables not so much 

[13:26] <lizmat> I don't, and I would find that useful

[13:26] <lizmat> however, that doesn't necessarily needs to be in the form of declarator docs

[13:32] <ugexe> Why would anything else be used?

[13:34] <ugexe> I would agree it doesn’t necessarily need to provide all the stuff that may have been originally speced (I haven’t read it) but I don’t see why we wouldn’t use the existing syntax people are already using

[14:02] <ab5tract> ugexe: what I meant is I’m not sure I see the purpose of #= specifically

[14:03] <ab5tract> But my broader point (that I failed to develop) is that it would help to know what is causing trouble implementation-wise

[14:04] <ab5tract> If #= is causing trouble, then maybe it could be dropped. But if it’s something else creating obstacles, then it’s probably fine to keep it

[19:59] <ab5tract> timo: there are other things that get in the way in modern macOS

[20:02] <timo> yeah

[20:02] <timo> this is macOS-12 is that modern?

[20:06] <ab5tract> nope

[20:06] <ab5tract> but after a second glance, it does appear that dylibs are +x
