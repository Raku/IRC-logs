[08:07] <ab5tract> nine: should I take that as a "go ahead and merge"? it might be nice to roll it into the upcoming release

[08:07] <ab5tract> but then again, it wasn't part of the blin run..

[08:08] <nine> That question is for the release manager to answer. I'm fine with the PR as it is

[08:09] <ab5tract> sweet

[08:11] <ab5tract> jdv: how do you feel about R#5555 and M#820 going into this release?

[08:11] <linkable6> R#5555 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5555 Add lookup for translating General_Category longnames

[08:11] <linkable6> M#820 [closed]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/820 Implement ShiftJIS decode and decodestream

[08:11] <ab5tract> erm, N#820

[18:44] <jdv> its still underway:)  takes a little while...

[19:00] <lizmat> and here I was thinking that: "has Mu $.a is built(:bind)"

[19:01] <lizmat> would be a purely compile time thing, but apparently that generates 74 bytes of bytecode

[19:02] <ab5tract> that really bytes ;)

[19:07] <lizmat> heh....  perhaps it *is* necessary, but for now, it's a bit of a WAT to me

[19:07] <jdv> hmm, looks like t/spec/S10-packages/basic.rakudo.moar is hung?... on 6.d-errata.

[19:07] <jdv> anyone else see that?

[19:08] <lizmat> % raku t/spec/S10-packages/basic.rakudo.moar

[19:08] <lizmat> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /Users/liz/Github/rakudo/t/spec/S10-packages/basic.rakudo.moar

[19:08] <lizmat> Could not find Test::Util in:

[19:08] <lizmat> not hanging for me

[19:09] <jdv> weird.  i'll try again.

[19:10] <ab5tract> lizmat: don't you need -Ilib there?

[19:10] <lizmat> shouldn't afaik ?

[19:11] <lizmat> anyways, Test::Util isn't in lib anyway

[19:11] <ab5tract> I mean, the test didn't run

[19:11] <ab5tract> but you're right

[19:11] <lizmat> afk for a bit&

[19:17] <ab5tract> > make t/spec/S10-packages/basic.t --> OK

[19:21] <jdv> yeah, same here on its own.  maybe its a new flapper.  doesn't sound familiar...

[19:25] <ab5tract> yeah, weird

[19:25] <ab5tract> maybe a cosmic ray :)
