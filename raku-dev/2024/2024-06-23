[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Improve `.flat` logic

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add positional to indicate number of levels to flatten.  Defaults

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   to Inf / Whatever

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - add boolean named arg :hammer.  If specified with a true value,

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   will disregard any containerization on Iterables, and flatten

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   those iterables.  Defaults to False

[18:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: <…commit message has 10 more lines…>

[19:09] <bisectable6> lizmat, On both starting points (old=2024.05 new=2d2fe08) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ roast: f89578af35 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | S32-list/flat.t

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ roast: Add tests for .flat($level, :hammer)

[19:24] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/Raku/roast/commit/f89578af35

[21:11] <ab5tract> patrickb: I've been putting all of the "fixed in RakuAST" tests in `t/12-rakuast/xx-fixed-in-rakuast.rakutest`

[21:12] <ab5tract> then we'll migrate them to roast when 6.e is released

[21:42] <patrickb> ab5tract: I guess "hopefully fixes in RakuAST" is also well placed there, right?

[21:44] <ab5tract> If it works in RakuAST, it can go there. There are some tests that will probably start failing as we add optimizations back in, but those failures can then inspire remediations

[21:45] <ab5tract> If it passes in current HEAD’s RakuAsT compiler, it’s a perfect fit
