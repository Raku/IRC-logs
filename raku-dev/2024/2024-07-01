[11:36] <tbrowder> hi, a note on macos cmd “mdfind”. man page says option “-name” gives filename. using github testing it looks like it means the complete path, not the basename. my test found the file basename without “-name” but not with “-name”

[11:41] *** librasteve_ left
[11:56] <lizmat> $path.IO.basename ?

[13:21] <tbrowder> maybe, i may have misspoken…need more tests. i need to set up ssh to our macbook. mdfind is definitely NOT like locate

[13:23] <lizmat> indeed... locate is little more than a grep on a file that happens to have all paths of a disk

[13:24] <lizmat> mdfind accesses the Spotlight db, which is another thing altogether :-)

[15:03] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[15:03] <notable6> lizmat, No notes for “weekly”

[16:11] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/07/01/2024-27-concurrency-learnings/
