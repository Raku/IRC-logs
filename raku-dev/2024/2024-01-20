[15:31] <AlexDaniel> jdv: re “hypthetically if the vm was written in $en_vogue_tech would it mean raku would be in a better place?” – I don't want to say that any action should be taken to rewrite something, but just to answer your question: Yes. There has been a lot of interest in Rust projects during the last few years, so having an actual and practical VM

[15:31] <AlexDaniel> would've gathered quite a lot of attention

[15:42] <lizmat> would that also have meant people to do that transition, in your opinion ?

[15:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/62a6745260

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I'm not sure I understand the question. Usually it's the original devs themselves doing the transition, or another option is somebody else is doing a complete fork

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> it's true that moar was started before rust was hyped up enough so not using it in the first place wasn't a mistake or something

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> the question was more hypothetical, the practical reality is a bit more complex

[15:54] <lizmat> indeed

[15:55] <lizmat> because I don't see jnthn doing a Rust transition

[15:56] <jdv> i just read an article thingee about the rust project suffering from a bunch of burnout

[15:56] <jdv> ai will be the end of it all anyway:)

[15:56] <lizmat> yeah... it's quite common in these types of open source projects

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> copilot actually helps a lot when writing rust :)

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> possibly the only case when I feel *significantly* slower without it

[16:17] <librasteve> anyone who would like a bit of Rust practice is welcome to join me and hack on raku Dan::Polars - imo that will soon cure any desire to rewrite moarvm in rust ;-)

[16:17] <librasteve> otoh zig looks quite interesting though I have not really used it

[16:20] <librasteve> there's a whole story in contrast raku vs rust as in 'can do' vs 'no can do' coding experiences
