[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Move setting of local $/

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: The fact that $/ was set inside an if, instead of inside the body,

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: may be the reason this failed on the JVM.  So move it into the body

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: of the helper sub (even though we may not actually need it).

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This in response to #5744

[10:50] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f055c31e02

[10:50] <lizmat> bartolin: ^^ could you check ?

[11:31] <bartolin> lizmat: nice, that indeed seems to help. I haven't run a full spectest yet, but S05-transliteration/trans.t is clean. \o/

[11:31] <lizmat> I guess the scoping rules on JVM are subtly different from MoarVM

[14:17] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/0a5f70703ba4fa2370923afd8de8332d - two blin failures since release.

[14:25] <[Coke]> BioPerl6 Cro::APIToken

[14:26] <[Coke]> each on a different trans commit

[14:46] <bartolin> I think the failure from BioPerl6 is something I saw yesterday as well. (But didn't look closely.)

[14:46] <bartolin> m: say "x".trans("y" => "")

[14:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar f055c31e0: OUTPUT: «x␤»

[14:46] <bartolin> m: say "x".trans(("y" => "",))

[14:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar f055c31e0: OUTPUT: «MVMArray: Index out of bounds␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Fix multi-needle .trans without replacements

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Spotted in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5745.

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Note that .trans("U" => "", "u" => "") is a very inefficient way

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: to do .trans("Uu" => "").

[15:35] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bcd7beaf7d

[15:39] <lizmat> it's about 5x as slow

[15:42] <[Coke]> c: HEAD say 2

[15:42] <committable6> [Coke], ¦HEAD(bcd7bea): «2␤»

[15:45] <[Coke]> that was quick, lizmat++

[16:03] <Geth> ¦ roast: a58a69cc08 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | S05-transliteration/trans.t

[16:03] <Geth> ¦ roast: Add test for #5745
