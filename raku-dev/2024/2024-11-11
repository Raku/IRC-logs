[00:28] <timo> ^- moarvm remote WIP "step until { bla raku code }" that lets you automatically step until some condition you write yourself is satisfied

[01:21] <ab5tract> timo: that is seriously cool

[18:43] <ab5tract> does anyone recall a long discussion in a problem-solving or issue ticket about removing the "that's Perl 5, this is Perl 6" category of exceptions that often get in the way of using valid Raku syntax?

[18:43] <ab5tract> I'd like to link it R#3295 and R#5652

[18:43] <linkable6> R#3295 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3295 Unsupported use of $] variable in array indexing using anonymous state variables

[18:43] <linkable6> R#5652 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5652 [Will be addressed in RakuAST] Can the parser for $] be made a little less agressive?

[18:45] <ab5tract> Doh! it's already right there in 5652 -> R#1356

[18:45] <linkable6> R#1356 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1356 [RFC] Let's remove most (if not all) perl5-oriented error messages for variables
