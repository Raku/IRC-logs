[14:46] <leont> Timo: sure

[14:47] <timo> i'm looking into making azure more useful or at least pretty to look at; there's two things of interest for the harness (if i switch to the harness6 for azure spec test runs) which are:

[14:47] <timo> - you can output a percentage to stdout/stderr that azure will pick up and assign to the current step somehow

[14:48] *** [Coke]_ joined
[14:48] <timo> - the PublishTestResults task can ingest a few different test result formats, like xunit, junit, ctest, vstest. i would like to write out which-ever is the simplest one of these so azure can show us our tests

[14:55] <timo> harness6 dynamically loads TAP::Harness after making sure it's cloned and up to date, so getting at the symbols at run-time is not possible, so i now have something terrible that 1) creates a TAP::Reporter implementing class that creates a TAP::Reporter::Console to forward all calls to and 2) adds a mixin to the TAP::Reporter::Console::Session that open-test creates to intercept/forward method

[14:55] <timo> calls on that to the original

[14:55] <timo> do you have a better idea how to get both the regular console output visible in the log, plus a (for example) junit output file, and/or maybe writing the verbose tap output to a file (or multiple)

[15:41] <leont> timo: sounds like what you want is an alternative Formatter that outputs xunit (or whatever)

[15:41] <leont> The system is pluggible, this is possible and depending on the format might not even be hard.

[15:42] <leont> Or actually a Reporter not a Formatter, I forgot I split things up a bit in later versions

[15:44] <timo> right, at least the junit format wants the total amount of tests in the root node of the resulting xml document, so a formatter itself doesn't seem like the right way

[15:44] <leont> Much of the architecture was inspired by perl's TAP::Harness, one of its extensions may be a good starting point.  TAP::Formatter::JUnit looks sensible enough.

[15:45] <leont> (to steal from)

[15:55] <timo> hrm, it pulls in a whole XML package, it would be cool if i could stay with very minimal dependencies, but i'll look at how the code flows anyway

[15:55] <leont> Yeah, but I think xunit is also XML based? I don't really know the other formats

[15:57] <timo> you don't happen to know how to work with a minidump and a little heap of .pdb files?

[15:58] <timo> ^- amazing, the quality of search results i find

[16:00] <leont> I can't find proper documentation for ctest. Not sure if it doesn't exist or is just hidden well. I would expect that not to be XML

[16:01] <timo> maybe it's the exact same syntax as you write in CMake files haha
