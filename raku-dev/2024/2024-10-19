[09:08] <lizmat> I see one quirk on MacOS japhb patrickb 

[09:08] <lizmat> instead of '[0] > '   I have '[0] >  ' as the prompt (aka 2 spaces after the >)

[09:10] <lizmat> other than that, it all works afaics

[18:42] <japhb> lizmat: The extra space is because T::LE reserves a space on either end of the edit field to place scroll markers without overwriting the prompt itself, going over the end of the line, or causing a jarring double-step just when scrolling starts.  The prompt itself also ends in a space, so it ends up doubled.

[18:43] <lizmat> so maybe the REPL prompt should have one space less if T::LE is mixed in ?

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Remove trailing space for T::LE

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: As it has a space of its own

[18:47] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6c30c5902d

[18:47] <japhb> Could do that, but I guess it depends on what conditions we want to maintain spacing consistency.  I'm mildly less annoyed by the current extra spacing than having scroll markers right up next to the prompt, but I'm not wedded to that choice.

[18:47] <japhb> Heh.  Don't get between Liz and a patch opportunity.  ;-)

[18:47] <lizmat> hehe...  it can be easily reverted

[19:00] <releasable6> Next release in ≈4 days and ≈23 hours. There are no known blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[19:27] <japhb> ab5tract: Assuming that no one finds a problem with patrickb's Terminal::MakeRaw as used in Terminal::LineEditor, any objection to making the same change in Terminal::Print?

[19:27] <japhb> That would similarly free T::P from the C compiler blues

[19:28] <japhb> Well, the input side of T::P I mean; the original output-only T::P didn't need it.

[22:44] <ab5tract> japhb: no objections whatsoever, considering they are already in place :)

[22:44] <ab5tract> I don’t think I bumped the version number though

[23:30] <japhb> Ah, that's why I didn't see that I needed to pull

[23:31] <japhb> All right, want to make a release then?
