[13:10] <Geth> ¦ WebService-GitHub/main: Fix dependencies

[13:10] <Geth> ¦ WebService-GitHub/main: 

[13:10] <Geth> ¦ WebService-GitHub/main: IO::Socket::SSL is required to access the GH API, but HTTP::Tiny doesn't

[13:10] <Geth> ¦ WebService-GitHub/main: depend on it. So we have to.

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Streamline return value logic

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make Binder.get_return_type return nqp::null on Mu

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - make p6typecheckrv op to just emit the value if type is nqp::null

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   effectively bypassing all typechecks if --> Mu

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: - streamline the raku-rv-typecheck dispatcher

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   - more comments

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   - fast-path handling of Nil / Failure being returned

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   - fewer checks on paths that need runtime / definite checks / coercion

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Extract the handling of generic types to a new dispatcher

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: "raku-rv-typecheck-generic", which puts a guard on the type

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: and then delegates to "raku-rv-typecheck".

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[16:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Adapt "raku-rv-typecheck" not need to guard on type anymore.
