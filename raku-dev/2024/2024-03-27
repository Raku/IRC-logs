[02:56] <MasterDuke> nine, lizmat: i just checked, reverting 3853a0f8be75c9df496df2d76481c191de69c9f7 and 196fbee64e8002272a4a7ed853315eedd160204f unbreaks the jvm build. reverting just 3853a0f8be75c9df496df2d76481c191de69c9f7 doesn't unbreak it, now trying just 196fbee64e8002272a4a7ed853315eedd160204f

[02:58] <MasterDuke> i have no idea why. the only thing i see without trying to understand what those commits do, is https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/196fbee64e8002272a4a7ed853315eedd160204f#diff-0b5a0e8e130a0a31ce79c5bc901373d2fb6ae209b25958ff4cb007338444b5e6R38 should that be `PseudoStash6c` instead of `PseudoStash`?

[03:03] <MasterDuke> ok, reverting just 196fbee64e unbreaks it

[07:02] <nine> MasterDuke: no, $!package is declared in PseudoStash 6.e, so that line is correct

[07:02] <tellable6> 2024-03-25T18:52:45Z #raku-dev <Xliff> nine Can you read the last my last comment on #5534 and see if you have any ideas? Thanks.

[07:02] <tellable6> 2024-03-26T18:41:16Z #raku <Xliff> nine What do you mean? Would you mind providing an example in #5534? Thanks.

[11:13] <Xliff> Updated #5534 - The root cause is that the Raku allocated structurs are causing friction, whereas C-allocated structures do not. Would appreciate some further help on this. Thanks.

[11:14] <Xliff> .tell nine Ah! Thanks for that... however that's going the wrong direction. I'm trying to have Raku share with C, not the other way around. So Raku originated String data needs to go to a (char *)

[11:15] <Xliff> .tell nine At any rate, it looks like the root-problem for #5534 is the Raku-allocated structure. If C  allocates, the problem goes away.
