[01:32] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: it seems that was fixed, but it made a issue (created by 4f64b4876b that was reverted) come back... (https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/574) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ARXNNhMc/image.png

[08:19] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: if you could provide a  golf the issue, I'd be much obliged, as running Red tests requires me to install a lot of dependencies :-(
