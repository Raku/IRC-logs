[18:12] <MasterDuke> anyone have any idea why `make test` in nqp *always* compiles NQPP5QRegex?

[18:13] <MasterDuke> the real question of course is, how to stop it from happening?

[18:16] <lizmat> MasterDuke: I haz no idea

[18:16] <MasterDuke> oh. i think i see it. target 'j-test' requires 'j-all', which required 'P5QREGEX_JVM'

[18:18] <MasterDuke> i guess target 'test' requiring 'all' is so if your build is outdated it'll automatically build everything before running the tests

[18:18] <lizmat> that has always been my understanding...

[18:19] <lizmat> the same rule applies in rakudo, btw

[18:19] <MasterDuke> but why does only NQPP5QRegex get recompiled every time?

[18:19] <lizmat> maybe misconfig in make file ?

[18:20] <MasterDuke> oh, i think because the P5QREGEX target gens a file first. `$(NOECHO)$(J_GEN_CAT) stage2 $(P5QREGEX_SOURCES) > '$(J_STAGE2_DIR)/$(P5QREGEX_COMBINED)'`, so make always see that the file is new and needs to be recompiled

[18:21] <lizmat> I guess the regen logic should set the last modified info to the highest of the dependent files ?

[18:22] <MasterDuke> hm, maybe i'll give that a try

[18:23] <lizmat> if that works out, then maybe the rakudo build logic should have a similar approach: if you change the 6.e core setting, it still recompiles 6.c and 6.d as well

[18:23] <lizmat> when I don't think that would be strictly necessary ?

[18:24] <MasterDuke> seems like it shouldn't be needed

[18:33] <lizmat> hmmm maybe the compiler ID depends on the whole source tree  ...

[18:43] <MasterDuke> J_LAST_P5QREGEX_SOURCES_MOD_TIME=`for file in $(P5QREGEX_SOURCES); do date --iso-8601=s -r $$file; done | sort -n | tail -n 1`

[18:44] <MasterDuke> touch -m --date=$(J_LAST_P5QREGEX_SOURCES_MOD_TIME) '$(J_STAGE2_DIR)/$(P5QREGEX_COMBINED)'

[18:44] <MasterDuke> does seem to prevent the compilation when i run `make j-test`

[18:44] <lizmat> :-)

[18:45] <MasterDuke> now how to get that correct in the makefile template...

[18:48] <lizmat> expect no help from me  :-(

[18:49] <MasterDuke> i think it's time to take the kids to the playground, will come back to this later...

[18:50] <MasterDuke> but that's bugged me for years, don't know why it took this long to figure out

[18:53] <lizmat> enjoy your kids and the playground!  :-)
