[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: RakuAST: fix use of constants on rakudoc configs

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: my constant FOO = 42;

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:     =for rakudoc :foo(FOO)

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: now correctly produces 42 in .resolved-config.  The problem was that

[10:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: it was looking at the wrong dynamic variable for the resolver.

[11:51] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lizmat-ValueList: sugar to easily create ValueLists, so ValueList.new(...) is the way
