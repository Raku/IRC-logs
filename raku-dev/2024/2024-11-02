[10:37] <lizmat> ok, so that didn't make it to the 2024.10 release  *phew*

[11:32] <timo> well, this is a little bit faster ...

[11:48] <timo> core.c setting compilation went from 625.756 page faults (average over 10 runs) down to 618.658

[11:48] <timo> that's kind of what i was hoping for when i made these changes

[11:49] <timo> time went from 45.788 +- 0.222 to 42.704 +- 0.235
