[15:41] <jdv> thanks

[15:59] <jdv> [Coke]: what do you want to do?

[16:04] <[Coke]> I just wanted to make sure there was backup, I didn't necessarily need to press any buttons todya

[16:05] <[Coke]> we now have working blin backup (yay), I have the keys needed to sign releases...

[16:07] <jdv> do you have commit bits for all the repos

[16:08] <jdv> do you have your pgp fingerprint in your gh profile like me and patrickb?

[16:08] <[Coke]> Yes - was able to sign one of my releases: here;

[16:08] <jdv> spectest is clean for me atm, installed ake and Cro::HTTP::Client which i remember i need somewhere in this process

[16:09] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/raku-cal/releases/tag/2024.12

[16:10] <jdv> i believe i updated the 2 release guides well enough but i haven't tried to use them without my notes so not sure

[16:10] <jdv> did infra add your ssh key to the boxes it needs to be on?

[16:13] <jdv> how about i do the release today and you do the next one if you feel comfortable then or the one after that...?

[16:14] <[Coke]> I did NOT interact with infra. Yah, why don't you do it today, and I'll plan for january?

[16:14] <jdv> and then after you get a release out we can get patrickb onboard next

[16:14] <[Coke]> I can do a test run without pushing near new year.

[16:15] <jdv> well, part of this release is picking a date for the next so you tell me:)

[16:16] <jdv> coleman: can we get [Coke]'s ssh key setup for doing a release?

[16:21] <coleman> yes. post the PUBLIC key to an issue in Raku/infra

[16:22] <[Coke]> Jan-27

[16:22] <[Coke]> ?

[16:22] <jdv> friday is good for you?

[16:22] <[Coke]> or is it normally earlier? can do a week earlier also

[16:22] <[Coke]> No, I have $dayjob

[16:23] <jdv> oh, i was looking at december

[16:23] <jdv> jan 27 is a monday, right?

[16:25] <jdv> 2025-01-25 is a Sat.  is that what you mean?:)

[16:26] <[Coke]> coleman: done

[16:26] <[Coke]> ... I did mean saturday. wtf.

[21:59] <bartolin> I think that the error can be shortened to the following: ./rakudo-m 'my $f = "foo"; $f.IO.spurt: "say 42"; my $proc = shell(:in, :err, "script -q /dev/null \"$*EXECUTABLE.absolute()\" \"$f\""); $proc.in.spurt("\n", :close); say $proc.err.slurp(:close)'

[22:00] <bartolin> > script: tcgetattr/ioctl: Operation not supported

[22:01] <bartolin> I might be wrong, but it looks like this is the source of the error: https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/usr.bin/script/script.c?h=stable/14#n222

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Move test file that dies on JVM to t/09-moar

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This is really just a bandaid to make "make test" usable again. The

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: test doesn't work on the JVM backend: Even if I replace the usage of

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: atomicint with a plain int, there is a compile time error:

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main:   Type check failed for return value; expected Mu but got BASE (BASE)

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: As noted in the leading comment of the test file, the final destination

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: of the test should be roast, anyway. So hopefully moving it to

[22:32] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: t/09-moar is good enough for now.

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Provide adverbial forms of map

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This commit opens a different way of specifying map variants.

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: This is mostly for cosmetic reasons and operates under the

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: impression that named argument adverbs, had they been available,

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: would have been used over the smashedcase versions we currently

[22:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: offer.

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lower-bound-for-revision-gating: 

[23:38] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/lower-bound-for-revision-gating: This adds a finishing touch to revision gating: the ability to

[23:44] <ab5tract> surprised to see the map adverbs merged

[23:46] <ab5tract> I already had an improvement in mind, which is to pass the map block as the named parameter directly

[23:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Revise adverbial map forms to be more direct

[23:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: 

[23:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: Directly passing the block via the named arguments

[23:54] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/main: feels more fluent:
