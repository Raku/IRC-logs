[13:02] <jdv> patrickb: thanks

[14:13] <jdv> what is this auto-release build stuff doing for anyone?

[14:14] <jdv> the moarvm one just slows the release down.  does anyone use the other builds that hte auto-build things generates?

[14:27] <jdv> we already have a bunch of checks at gh that fail.  what's the point, really?

[14:35] <lizmat> isn't it the idea that eventually the auto-build will become authoritative ?

[14:36] <lizmat> agree that it shouldn't make things harder to release

[14:54] <jdv> iirc from skimming the original discussion it was about avoiding build failures on windows

[14:55] <jdv> but we already had pre-existing build checks that always break on moarvm so idk

[14:56] *** librasteve_ left
[14:58] <jdv> oh i said that already:)  anyway, I'd like to see a more holistic treatment cause it seems like we're just layering more redundant complications on.
