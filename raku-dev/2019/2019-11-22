[16:48] <lucasb> re discussion in raku executable PR: what is the canonical program name one should use in a Raku script shebang line? is it "#!/usr/bin/env rakudo" ? 

[16:53] <lizmat> lucasb: I guess in the end depends on what implementation of Raku you want to target

[16:53] <lizmat> if you don't want to target any specifiic, I guess you could use "raku"

[16:54] <lizmat> if you want to target the rakudo implementation, I guess "rakudo" (after vrurg's changes )

[16:58] <lucasb> lizmat: thanks. I agree if both rakudo and raku are available and mean the same executable

[16:59] <lizmat> then I would say "rakudo", as "raku" is not guaranteed to be the Rakudo implementation

[17:25] *** maettu left
[17:30] <tbrowder> lizmat: was that the same possible behavior with perl6?

[17:31] <tbrowder> i mean is there another raku?

[17:38] *** ExtraCrispy left
[17:42] <AlexDaniel> lizmat, lucasb: but why would you target rakudo specifically

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> if you wrote a raku script and you want people to run it, just use `raku`

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> imagine if somebody forked rakudo and called it fookudo, and people started using it, same language and same compiler-specific features, why would everything need to adjust the shebang just because there's a new compiler now?

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> as a user I'd imagine being able to just switch between them with update-alternatives on debian, or the like

[18:44] <tbrowder> pr merges coming, yes?

[18:49] <AlexDaniel> moarvm was released from a branch, and same is true for nqp/rakudo releases, I don't think anything should've been holding back mergesâ€¦

[18:57] <dogbert17> samcv++

[19:12] <tbrowder> i recall you saying no merges until moarvm was released, maybe because it may effect raku pr testing?

[19:14] <tbrowder> anyway, moot point now

[19:34] <moritz> masak: I've just spent a few minutes reducing a bug to a minimal example (https://github.com/retupmoca/p6-markdown/issues/32) and was reminded of your bug submission sprees :D

[21:56] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Is there a specific reason the rakudo files downloads are redirected to github instead of displaying the list on rakudo.org?

[21:57] <tellable6> 2019-11-15T12:20:40Z #raku <rba> patrickb Thanks for the changes. Will let you know as soon as a testing site based on your repo is setup.

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: not really, no. We had them on rakudo.org, then the infrastructure collapsed so I put release tars on github and we just redirected because that's what we had at the moment

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I don't know what's the best way forward

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I think wetried to upload the tars back, and then rba told me to stop because the machine was running out of space :)

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> rba: ping :)

[21:59] <patrickb> OK. I'm working on a rebuild of the rakudo.org download pages. I'd like to revive the non-github download page.

[22:02] <rba> AlexDaniel: space expanded

[22:54] <dogbert17> ++AlexDaniel

[22:54] <patrickb> Would it be a bad idea to change the naming scheme of the release files a bit?

[22:56] <AlexDaniel`> Iike?

[22:56] <patrickb> I'd like to put the operating system in the filename. Currently it's implicitly deduced from the file extension. But that breaks down with precompiled release archives as multiple operating systems use the same archive format.

[22:57] <AlexDaniel`> You mean star?

[22:58] <patrickb> rakudo-star-2018.10-x86_64 (JIT).msi -> rakudo-star-2018.10-win-x86_64 (JIT).msi

[22:58] <patrickb> Star and compiler only releases as well

[22:58] <AlexDaniel`> Mm

[22:58] <patrickb> well, compiler only currently is only source, but still the same problem.

[22:59] <patrickb> rakudo-2019.07.1.tar.gz -> rakudo-2019.07.1-src.tar.gz

[22:59] <patrickb> then one can add rakudo-2019.07.1-macos.tar.gz and so on

[22:59] <AlexDaniel`> I wouldn't do that... Stuff probably depends on it

[23:00] <patrickb> I do see renaming sucks a bit, because existing tools or workflows might rely on the previous name.

[23:00] <patrickb> But I'm not sure how to cleanly progress otherwise

[23:00] <AlexDaniel`> But new binary files feel free to call whatever you want

[23:00] <patrickb> We could keep the current names as is and only do the new releases with the new schema

[23:02] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: honestly, I don't see any problem

[23:02] <AlexDaniel> so the source release is just .tar.gz, and you can have binary files called whatever

[23:03] <AlexDaniel> i don't see how it interferes

[23:04] <patrickb> It doesn't. But it's not consistent. rakudo-star-2019.07.dmg vs rakudo-2019.07-macos.tar.gz

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> rakudo star naming can be tweaked, I think

[23:05] <patrickb> The rakudo.org website manages all files in a single folder and distinguishes them solely by looking at the file extension.

[23:06] <patrickb> That approach, as simple as it is, falls apart the moment you have a file extension that applies to multiple os'. As is the case with .tar.gz

[23:07] <AlexDaniel> right

[23:07] <AlexDaniel> unless we put binary releases somewhere separate?

[23:07] <patrickb> So my thought is to explicitly put the os in the name so we don't rely on extension anymore to keep the files appart.

[23:08] <patrickb> We could do that.

[23:08] <AlexDaniel> anyway, I'm back to bed, but don't expect source release filenames to change, I'm not open to that

[23:08] <patrickb> Have a good sleep!

[23:09] <AlexDaniel> thanks :)
