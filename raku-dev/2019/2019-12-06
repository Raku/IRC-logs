[13:52] <eater> https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_improve_perl_6_ did this grant get accepted? I don't see any updates about it afterwards

[13:55] *** benjif1 joined
[13:56] <lizmat> afaik Kaipei is still working on it ?

[13:56] <sena_kun> eater: the grant was accepted, but work on it is slow, alas.

[13:56] <sena_kun> Kaiepi is working on it

[14:02] <eater> ah cool

[14:04] <eater> I've long ago made the first steps for Unix socket support, but I never got the Rakudo side done (IO::Socket::INET has unix socket support in Moar!), and wanted to take a shot again, but I guess I'll have to poke them for that

[14:05] <sena_kun> eater: yes, the best way would be to ping Kaiepi and ask about the state of things

[14:17] <tyil> eater: o/

[17:40] <tbrowder> .tell tony-o  I heard from Jan Schulte, the Travis Engineer, he said he had increased our build time to 90 minutes, so maybe we can roast on Rakudo builds.

[17:40] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tony-o
