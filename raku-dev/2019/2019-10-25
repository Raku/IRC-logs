[12:05] <tbrowder> nine: the problem is the class needs to be in nqp in rakudo/src/Perl6/*.nqp where $=data is created. i don't see how it can be done otherwise, but of course i certainly don't claim to be an expert here.

[18:32] <patrickb> Is it bad when raku creates the core repository folders already during the build and not only at install time?

[18:32] <tellable6> 2019-10-21T22:07:58Z #perl6-dev <samcv> patrickb specfile is the source files that tell the rpmbuilder how to create an rpm

[18:35] <vrurg> patrickb: I think it is if they're created outside of the base dir.

[18:37] <patrickb> There is a conflict of interest. On the one side we don't want the build raku to not touch the install folders, but on the other hand we want it to be able to use the install repo.

[18:40] <vrurg> Use for what? Inline::Perl5?

[18:49] *** ggoebel joined
[18:50] <patrickb> Yup.

[19:08] <vrurg> patrickb: Can't we have it installed locally within base dir somehow?

[19:10] <patrickb> We could. It's mostly a question of what we want. If we want the build dir raku to have access to the full repo in the install dir, then installing Inline::Perl5 into basedir isn't going to help.

[19:12] <vrurg> patrickb: I don't like the idea of rakudo accessing the install dir prior installation. What if the version we build isn't compatible with the installed one and mangles with the main repo in non-revertible way?

[19:12] <patrickb> summon nine

[19:14] <timotimo> https://wakelift.de/p/c3f095d6-8827-426f-9d0e-d2c1a230731d/ - i would welcome a bit of proofreading/review of my latest grant report

[19:14] <patrickb> vrurg: I agree. How could an alternative look? I the only need actually Inline::Perl5? Or are there other modules we might access from the build dir?

[19:16] <vrurg> timotimo: I left a tab opened.

[19:18] <vrurg> patrickb: The alternative would be using, say, blib as a file repository. Whatever we need at compile time ‚Äì we know about it. Whatever somebody needs for testing ‚Äì he can use -I 

[19:19] <patrickb> Then https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3236 is already the final solution.

[19:21] <vrurg> patrickb: perhaps. I can't get deeper into it now though.

[19:21] <patrickb> I think nine needs to give his oppinion on this. He's the original reporter of the bug/problem.

[19:22] <timotimo> vrurg: hum?

[19:23] <vrurg> timotimo: opened your link, left it opened to read later. :)

[19:24] <timotimo> ah, ok

[19:24] <timotimo> thank you

[19:24] <vrurg> timotimo: BTW, I have pinpointed the run-away closure problem and even kinda fixed it a few minutes ago.

[19:24] <timotimo> oh, nice

[19:24] <timotimo> looking forward to reading all about it in a commit message, or on channel, or whereever :)

[19:24] <timotimo> for now i'll be AFK a bit

[19:25] <vrurg> But might need more help because it seemingly breaks nativecall test in rakudo. But this I need to check out carefully because with the amount of the debug stuff I put into the core anything could happen.

[19:28] <vrurg> patrickb: I'll try to remember about the issue. Perhaps would find a better solution to the outside dirs. But in general, the only good one is to build everything into blib. Anything else is a hack.

[19:29] <vrurg> Correspondingly, modules needed during build/test stage must go into blib too.

[21:31] <patrickb> and that's not wanted.

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> I'm confused

[21:31] <patrickb> ah! I misstyped that!

[21:31] <patrickb> Yes, it's wrong.

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> so TL;DR build process writes outside the build dir

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> you can fix the commit description if you want, then I think we can merge

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> not that I see any issue with it, it just feels like an asswards way of doing it :)
