[14:21] <sena_kun> sharing some info about the next release status: I have my defense tomorrow, Comma release at Friday, and after that I'll dedicate a weekend (or more, though I hope it won't be necessary) for preparing the next rakudo release.

[19:37] <bartolin> for the record: the JVM build is broken atm. There were some changes to NQP recently to make the nqp-runtime.jar get rebuild once a .java file is changed. Unfortunately these changes lead to the installed nqp not finding nqp-runtime.jar anymore (e.g. https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/jobs/625973792#L361)

[19:37] <bartolin> I'll try to look for a fix.

[19:42] <bartolin> While looking at it I stumbled (again) upon a comment 'This file automatically generated by ...' in jvmconfig.properties. It looks strange to my eyes. Is there something special to this comment or could I just add a 'was' and change it to 'This file was automatically generated by ...'?

[19:42] <bartolin> It looks like it was introduced in 2008 with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8a924351c4 and then copied around quite a bit (also to the NQP repo).

[19:44] <bartolin> we still have it in https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/tools/build/gen-cat.pl#L18 and https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/tools/build/gen-jvm-properties.pl#L39

[19:45] <MasterDuke> adding the 'was' is maybe *more* proper, but it doesn't seem strange to me as is

[19:48] <bartolin> ok, then it's just English not being my first language. thanks :)
