[14:25] <tyil> japhb: EA?

[14:28] <japhb> Escape Analysis -- it's a difficult but powerful optimization that he's been working on in MoarVM

[14:34] *** MasterDuke joined
[14:34] <tyil> ah

[14:35] <tyil> optimizations are always welcome to me :D

[22:16] <vrurg> patrickb: moving over here.

[22:16] <patrickb> I'd vote for a fix (even if hacky) before the next release.

[22:17] <vrurg> patrickb: I agree. 

[22:17] <vrurg> Still, a ticket in problem solving, right?

[22:17] <patrickb> Yes.

[22:18] <patrickb> I'll type something together. But not tonight anymore.

[22:18] <vrurg> Looking forward for it. 

[22:18] <vrurg> Definitely no rush. 

[22:18] <vrurg> It's gonna be One More Big Change In Build which I hoped we don't do anymore for a long time. 

[22:19] <vrurg> But this mess needs some more cleanup.

[22:19] <patrickb> If we actually decide to do something like that. I have a feeling there is a reason the files are sprinkled around the build directory. I seem to recall other languages do it similarly.

[22:20] <vrurg> patrickb: I always liked perl5 approach of targeting into blib/

[22:22] <vrurg> With this issue we either have a bad hacky solution; even worse solution of no autodetection of the dirs (hardcoding them, etc.); or no autocreation of the dir structure. Those are the only alternative I see to the unchanged build structure.

[22:23] *** Kaiepi joined
[22:25] <patrickb> I think I'll go with putting a `PERL6_HOME=buildir/gen`in tools/templates/moar/perl6-m-build.c.in

[22:25] *** timotimo joined
[22:25] <timotimo> yo

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> \o/

[22:27] <vrurg> timotimo: welcome home! :)

[22:29] <vrurg> timotimo: I'm still about the closure problem. The interesting thing: a sub gets its closure but partially, up to the unit level. Core setting is not included. Does it trigger something for you?

[22:30] <timotimo> doesn't ring a bett

[22:30] <tony-o_> what is the Build ticket in problem solving?

[22:32] <vrurg> timotimo: let's put it other way. There is an empty frame between !UNIT_MARKER and first CORE. Could it be that somewhere capturing code deliberately stops iterating on this condition?

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> tony-o_: ?

[22:42] <tony-o_> vrurg and patrickb were discussing a change to Build somewhere and moved here, was curious what it is

[22:44] <vrurg> tony-o_: I think we're unrelated to Build ticket. It's about the build process in general.

[22:47] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: patzim++ created pull request #3236: Don't put CompUnitRepo folders outside the build dir during build

[22:47] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3236

[22:53] <tony-o_> curious to know more regardless, this was something nine ugexe and i discussed pretty heavily in oslo 2 ptses ago

[22:54] *** tony-o_ is now known as tony-o

[22:55] <vrurg> tony-o: a problem-solving ticket is coming. This gonna be another big change which we want to prepare carefuly.

[22:57] <tony-o> can't wait

[22:59] <patrickb> I'm heading off to bed. 'night everyone!

[22:59] *** patrickb left
[22:59] <vrurg> He's always fast, leaving no time to say "g'night!" ;)

[23:02] <vrurg> Interesting. 6.e announce will contain a note about 'changes between Perl 6.d and Raku 6.e'
