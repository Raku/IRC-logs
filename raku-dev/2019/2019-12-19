[10:34] <nine> tbrowder: it might be the other way around: if the dist contained a META6.json PAUSE would have moved it to Perl6 automatically

[10:36] <tbrowder> it definitely has a META6.json on the github site and

[10:39] <nine> tbrowder: oh, then something weird is going on

[10:41] <tbrowder> i don't know how lizmat found it, but i'll check and see if one of the other modules went the same route

[10:42] <nine> Could be that a PAUSE update removed the auto detection

[10:59] <tbrowder> i just used metacpan and couldn't find text::utils. not sure how she found it

[11:01] <tbrowder> anyway, the ones i messed up, including text::utils

[11:03] <tbrowder> messed up by uploading to my dir instead of Perl6 are on the cpan delete list and should disappear in a couple of days

[11:54] <lizmat> the Raku bit caught my eye, as it was unexpected to see that there  :-)

[11:56] <tbrowder> understandably so! my bad, but files should be gone in a couple of days

[11:59] <lizmat> I was just surprised  :-)
