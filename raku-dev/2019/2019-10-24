[13:08] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: ideally we'd run it again afterwards too

[13:08] <Kaiepi> ok

[13:10] <Kaiepi> idt reverting all the changes in the pullreq that's from is a good idea because the way it changes how flags are handled when resolving makes hostname resolution a bit more efficient and fixes an error that would happen when resolving any kind of address on dragonflybsd

[13:14] <Kaiepi> it's something i'd have to revert manually because of how messy the commits in it ended up though

[14:00] <vrurg> sena_kun: any PR in roast.

[14:01] <vrurg> sena_kun: I was about to merge 587, but think it's better wait for release branching.

[14:02] <sena_kun> vrurg, what's the reasoning? They don't affect anything in the implementation that is shipped, in fact they help to identify if anything previously fixed is busted on master.

[14:03] <vrurg> I'm not in the details of the release process, worried if this could break anything. Though you're right.

[14:03] <sena_kun> I can understand the "probably easier to release" argument, but I just don't see how roast affects the actual artifacts produced.

[19:22] <tbrowder> advice, please: i'm starting to try to implement pod $=data and need an object to have both Associative and Positional roles. i made a cursory attempt in basic nqp but had problems. i think i need to go toward 6model direction per nqp/docs/6model/overview. and start developing the class inside World.nqp. does that sound like the right direction? i'm pretty confident i can just do positional only for a start with an 

[19:22] <tbrowder> array and put off the hash/array class until later.

[19:27] <tbrowder> i think i'll go the array only route for now, but advice on how to create the needed multi-role class would be helpful.
