[15:31] <vrurg> jnthn: what causes 'Object not in set of those to guard against' error from nqp::speshguardtype?

[15:33] <jnthn> vrurg: You're trying to put a guard on an object, but it's not one that the plugin has previously been told about, so it doesn't know what to do

[15:35] <vrurg> jnthn: thanks! Looks like another code-digging for another couple of days for me. :)

[15:35] <jnthn> vrurg: How did you encoutner this?

[15:37] <vrurg> Trying to get FQN-calls work by lookups on concretizations. But the strange part is that it seemingly fails on a class taken from $?CLASS

[15:38] <vrurg> Thep point is spesh is seeing first if it's called in a role and if not then falls back to class. In either case it must now precisely what type object the call belongs to in order to dispatch properly.

[15:41] <vrurg> *know precisely

[16:56] <lucasb> the same way 'perl' and 'perl5.30.x' are hard links of each other, I went to the parent directory of 'perl6' and created a 'raku' link there. Can't this be done in the 'make install' process, for this next release? This an opportunity to introduce this name earlier. Any precautions for not doing so?

[16:57] <lucasb> people would be able to update their shebang lines earlier

[16:58] <lucasb> there are advice out there to create a shell alias, but it doesn't work the same as a symbolic or hard link

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: I'd love to see something like that, yeah

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: but I have no idea what's the right way to do it, especially when it comes to other systems like windows

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> .seen patrickb

[18:01] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I saw patrickb 2019-11-12T10:26:17Z in #raku: <patrickb> Is there any documentation of how the p6c ecosystem works and is meant to work wrt versioning?

[18:40] <TreyHarris> I'm looking again at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3296 and linked issues and something confuses the heck out of me: was there ever a version of Rakudo in 6.c or later that would have handled the 'is export' trait the same in a .pm6 file whether or not there was a package declaration of some kind?

[18:43] <TreyHarris> B/c I can't see where the code as described would have ever worked

[20:16] <nine> AlexDaniel: on Windows just copy the executable. It's just a couple of kilobytes anyway

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> hm, indeed

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> ok, I filed this ticket: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3303

[20:24] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I'll see if can get to it this weekend.
