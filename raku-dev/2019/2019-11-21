[09:19] <lizmat> hmmm... did we lose bisectable6 ?

[09:47] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: restarted let's see if it joins

[09:47] <AlexDaniel> it probably failed to connect because freenode didn't like that many connections :)

[09:49] <AlexDaniel> thank you bisectable6 for coming back :)

[09:52] <AlexDaniel> first sponsor on github!

[09:52] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

[09:53] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, you are welcome!

[09:53] <sena_kun> github has finally unblocked my account...

[09:53] <AlexDaniel> btw github did match the contribution, so it says 14.44‚Ç¨ (16$) per month

[09:54] <AlexDaniel> ok maybe shouldn't have revealed that :)

[09:54] <sena_kun> : )

[09:55] <AlexDaniel> but it's weird, it doesn't really list their part anywhere (they just say that they'll match contributions, but it doesn't show up)

[09:56] <AlexDaniel> but when you look at the final overview the amount is just different

[10:07] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: btw I'm now learning that whole organizations can be sponsored (I think?). See https://github.com/sponsors/rakudo/waitlist

[10:14] <AlexDaniel> more info: https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization

[10:18] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: maybe consider adding an issue template to https://github.com/croservices/cro that has a link to https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Acroservices

[10:19] <AlexDaniel> or maybe a link to all existing issues from https://cro.services/ can help?

[10:20] <AlexDaniel> that /issues feature is really helpful when you have to deal with multiple repos, I wish github linked to it by default from org pages

[10:22] <AlexDaniel> (why: I went to https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues to take a look at issues and realized that some of them are moved to/created at other repos)

[13:07] <bisectable6> lizmat, Bisecting by output (old=2015.12 new=ed8f514) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[13:08] <bisectable6> lizmat, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/ed9af9ccb2b140d667018eca8e6dee02

[13:08] <bisectable6> lizmat, (2017-06-13) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b0a1b6c31c8ee93dec53ba117bd2d8b68bfcfd31

[13:24] <nine> lizmat: there used to be difference in between v.6c mode and v.6d. There's a decontrv_op sub that emits a p6decontrv versus a p6decontrv_6c op based on language version. jnthn's shortcut seems to miss this distinction.

[13:25] <lizmat> well, I can't seem to find that code in HEAD anymore, but then again I'm not functioning at 100% atm

[13:29] <nine> me neither :/ On the latter

[13:29] <nine> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L3923

[13:33] <nine> The difference between decontrv and decontrv_v6c seems to be about the special handling of Proxy

[17:34] <Kaiepi> shit, misread the issue i just posted a comment in

[17:36] <Kaiepi> would it be worth making a problem solving issue about what i posted though? it was about how the MOP still requires knowing nqp if you're writing your own HOW, even with Metamodel::Primitives

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: can't answer without some context :)

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> link?

[19:18] <Kaiepi> AlexDaniel, i deleted it, but the gist is when writing your own HOW, rakudo's metamethods often expect arrays and hashes to have a repr you can use nqp's array and hash ops with, not P6opaque like List and Hash have

[19:21] <Kaiepi> this means metaroles like Metamodel::TypePretense require you to either use nqp or use a type with the right repr to represent arrays and hashes with

[19:23] <Kaiepi> this was the example i used. this throws, but if you change it so it uses an nqp::list instead of a List it works fine https://hastebin.com/torazomapo.rb

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> I see‚Ä¶

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> how did you get into this issue?

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> anyway, yeah, please submit a ticket
