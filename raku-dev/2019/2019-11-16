[20:49] <lucasb> I assumed the synopses and other historical documents would remaing unchanged

[20:50] <lucasb> *remain

[20:55] <lucasb> These old design docs are not kept update with current language details, so I don't think making this change will bring benefits. I'd prefer this commit was reverted.

[21:03] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: around, by a chance?

[21:17] <lizmat> lucasb: did you read the entire commit message ?

[21:18] <lizmat> if we all agree that this commit should be reverted, then maybe we should *not* be hosting this on design.raku.org, but keep it on design.perl6.org instead

[21:19] <lizmat> hosting it on design.raku.org implies change to me

[21:46] <vrurg> lizmat: I actually agree with lucasb. Those are historical things and better be kept as-is. We only need a note explaining this for newcomers. With the note it's ok to be on raku.org

[21:48] <vrurg> Though I admire the efforts it took to get them changed!

[21:49] <lizmat> Well, the text was already confusing, with "Perl" being used to both indicate Perl 5 as well as Perl 6

[21:50] <lizmat> in any case, if we want to keep this unchanged, then I would *really* want to have this hosted on design.perl6.org

[21:50] <lizmat> because moving it to design.raku.org would then also constitute a change

[21:51] <rba> lizmat: I can just revert the hosting change and redirect design.raku.org to design.perl6.org

[21:53] <rba> The Apocalypse links via dev.perl.org back to perl6.org->raku.org are kind of something we need to rethink too.

[21:54] <lizmat> yeah...  :-)

[21:58] <Geth> Â¦ specs: review: https://github.com/perl6/specs/pull/126

[22:00] <lizmat> please add your comments to the PR  :-)

[22:02] <lizmat> vrurg: wrt the effort: it was just over an hour's work.  It wouldn't be the first hour of work I spent on Raku that would be disregarded

[22:03] <vrurg> lizmat: I judge by myself and it'd take me significantly over 1hr to do the same. :)

[22:04] <lizmat> vrurg: I have the advantage that the first 2 years I spent on working on Perl 6, I mostly lived in the specs and wrote / rearranged parts of them

[22:04] <lizmat> so it was pretty familiar terrain for me
