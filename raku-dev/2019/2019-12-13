[00:22] <japhb> vrurg: I concur that there are some basic playground modules that people almost certainly want, such as JSON::Fast, OO::Monitors, Linenoise, debugger/tracer modules, etc.  I expect that eventually there will be better replacements for each, but until that happens, they're pretty basic needs.

[00:23] <vrurg> japhb: The exact set of modules to be called "basic" could be discussible. I don't expect it to be permanent forever. 

[00:24] <vrurg> Just what is considered to be good at some point in time.

[00:24] <japhb> AlexDaniel: val() is (by design) able to handle a very wide range of different number formats.  I could twist your brain with some of the things I was testing when I did the first version of Str.Numeric (which val() was based on).

[00:24] <japhb> vrurg: Yeah, with some history so that people who are dabbling don't have to worry their basic scripts will suddenly stop working without much notice.

[00:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: does it?

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> hmmmm

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> did I both the release or something…

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> botch

[00:28] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: MOAR_REVISION: 2019.07.1-403-g9442b1a7c

[00:28] <pmurias> vrurg: I have been manually applying a similiar fix on nqp-j to make working on nqp-j not super horrible

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> ok I didn't: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/3e05931f3b7ecbc46794bced4b443240ad6aecd5/tools/templates/MOAR_REVISION

[00:28] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: seemingly, the release needs minors as it comes with 2019.07 moar

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> that's a good start

[00:28] <vrurg> Hm...

[00:29] <vrurg> pmurias: Shall I merge it?

[00:30] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I suspect the moar bump in release did not merge back to the master.

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: that's actually correct, I think

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> because 2019.07* describe string was actually ahead of the release

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> (even though it is based off 2019.07)

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> so when I merged back I left it intact

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> but it is surprising that there were several bumps after that

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> and all of them are of 2019.07…

[12:02] <jnthn> I'm a bit surprised val attempts such a complex expression at all...

[12:02] <lizmat> fwiw, in my refactor, that would be 409.6, as it would be in an ordinary expression

[12:02] <lizmat> it's in the spec, and it does

[12:02] <jnthn> OK

[12:02] <lizmat> are you saying that it shouldn't?  It would make things a *lot* simpler  :-)

[12:03] <jnthn> Then I'd assume the spec would want ordinary precedence rules to be followed.

[12:03] <lizmat> indeed... ok...

[12:03] <lizmat> it will  :-)

[12:03] <jnthn> Well, not sure without looking into the history of it, but I'm a bit surprised

[12:03] <jnthn> I thought val was meant to handle, well, values.

[12:03] <jnthn> e.g. things that full beneath <value>

[12:04] <lizmat> I guess we agree on that, it's just the definition of what constitutes a value, I guess

[12:04] <jnthn> I guess I can see the use of it

[12:04] <lizmat> m: BEGIN @*ARGS = "2*10**3"; sub MAIN(Int:D $a) { dd $a }   # YIL I learned that this actually works

[12:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «IntStr.new(2000, "2*10**3")␤»

[22:21] <lizmat> looks like my 29 ENV entries are responsible for about 14 msecs for each raku startup

[22:21] <lizmat> afk for a bit&

[22:34] <japhb> lizmat: Woah -- that's around 10-15% of startup on my machines.  Is that true for all hash lookups via <key>, only for lookups in dynamic hashes, or only lookups in %*ENV?

[22:35] <japhb> Depending on the answer to that, there's a metric ton of optimization I can go and do in some of my modules ....

[22:35] <japhb> (Tempted to go and test it now, excpet I've got $dayjob tasks to complete.  :-/)

[22:36] *** pmurias joined
[22:43] * japhb realizes (again) how important it is to test assumptions -- I always assumed hash lookup by compile-time short string constant would be about as fast a hash lookup as you could get.

[23:15] <lizmat> it can't be compile time, because hash lookups are methods and late bound

[23:26] <lizmat> japhb: looks like the 10 msecs where mostly from parsing the test code

[23:27] <lizmat> val("a") for ^29   was about 14 msecs extra

[23:28] <lizmat> m: val("a") for ^29; say now - INIT now    # but actual execution was much less

[23:28] <lizmat> will look at making this smarter tomorrow
