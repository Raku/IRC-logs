[06:18] <entonian> only the level 1 links.

[06:19] <entonian> Sorry, wrong group.

[08:50] <nine> Xliff: because there's no incorporate_multi_methods method in our meta model, nor has there ever been one. Did you mean multi_methods_to_incorporate?

[09:21] <Xliff> I might have. Did I just misname something?

[09:32] <lizmat> Files=1294, Tests=109646, 211 wallclock secs (28.34 usr  8.02 sys + 2970.88 cusr 265.23 csys = 3272.47 CPU)

[09:36] <Xliff> I will need to start running builds against my scripts.

[09:36] <Xliff> Good night! :)

[20:31] <lizmat> .ask sena_kun is there a release branch: can I push a possibly breaking (but make spectest clean change) to master ?

[20:31] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to sena_kun

[20:36] <sena_kun> lizmat: there is no release branch (the one we have won't do, I think), I know commits we'll fit into a release and will make a release out of them.

[20:37] <lizmat> so you're saying it's ok to push to master?  Or would you prefer me making a branch (which I must admit, I'd rather not do)

[20:37] <sena_kun> if I am understanding everything correctly, I can just make a branch out of rakudo commit I want and then run sake script with BRANCH_RAKUDO=foo.

[20:37] <sena_kun> lizmat: I think you can push to master.

[20:38] <sena_kun> lizmat: do you have any idea about moarvm team, by the way?

[20:38] <lizmat> ok, I will then, either later today or tomorrow :-)
