[14:28] <lizmat> notable6: weekly

[14:28] <vrurg> Am I missing something or we don't have a fast path for splitting a string into chars? comb is SLOW.

[14:28] <notable6> lizmat, 5 notes: https://gist.github.com/e01f0e2e4bddd3693be8b5ad6b4e9af1

[14:28] <lizmat> vrurg: we do not have a fast path

[14:28] <lizmat> it's all nqp::substr()

[14:29] <lizmat> would be nice if we had a nqp:: op for creating a list_s of all graphemes

[14:30] <vrurg> lizmat: problem with comb for me is not even use of nqp::substr but use of Seq. Somehow it gets .sink called and this is where it takes most time.

[14:34] <lizmat> if I profile for ^100000 { Nil for "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".comb }

[14:34] <lizmat> I see pull-one as the most busy one

[14:35] <jnthn> On a big string, the laziness is better for memory, though

[14:36] <jnthn> Heck, even on a small one it is probably easier for EA to reason about, in the long run

[14:42] <vrurg> Sorry, but it looks like a false alarm. It was to late yesterday and I didn't trace it deeper, beyond sink which is a part of for-loop which is where my code steps in again.

[14:44] <vrurg> Which moarperf would work for me... Profiling with html requires real patience and time. :(

[14:44] <vrurg> *Wish

[14:46] <nine> vrurg: use SQL output and https://github.com/timo/moarperf

[14:47] <vrurg> nine: that's what I'm saying. moarperf is not displaying the results.

[15:36] <vrurg> |Tux|: Don't change binaries until you deliberately make code not compatible with older versions.

[15:37] <|Tux|> hmmm

[15:37] <vrurg> Or unless you don't publish them.

[15:37] <|Tux|> ok, I will wait for a signal

[15:46] <vrurg> lizmat: What blogging platform is preferable? I used to had self-hosted wordpress long years ago. But it's closed now and can't even find how to unlink it.

[15:47] <lizmat> whatever works best for you  :-)

[15:51] <vrurg> Ok, perhaps the best would be to write to wordpress support. :)

[15:55] <|Tux|> one that does not force ugly fonts on the poor reader

[15:55] <|Tux|> I always have to disable font selection in wordpress blogs before I can read it

[17:52] <jmerelo> Thanks, sjn. I'd like to know about the Advent Calendar article. It should be scheduled already, to be published tonight, but I'd like to know if it'll be ready 

[17:52] <jmerelo> It should have to be tomorrow at the latest, but we'll make do with whatever, as long as we don't have anything else to publish

[17:52] <jmerelo> s/whatever/wherever

[17:53] <jmerelo> also, the advent calendar call for backup articles is still open

[17:53] <sjn> AFAIK, he told me that he got access to the blog last week from you, and that he's ready

[17:54] <sjn> I can double-check if you want, though

[17:54] <jmerelo> Well

[17:54] <jmerelo> It's already too late to publish it in the allotted time, which is in a few hours

[17:54] <jmerelo> I like to have a look at the articles before they're published, just in case

[17:55] <jmerelo> I've rescheduled another article, but if I get it today in the morning, I could schedule it for the 17th

[17:55] <jmerelo> Sorry, 18th

[17:56] <jmerelo> Anyway

[17:56] <jmerelo> I guess you get my point, so please convey it to him.

[17:56] <sjn> will do now

[17:58] <patrickb> rba: Working. Thank you! There is now a "Other Platforms" tab with BSD in it :-)

[18:00] <sjn> jmerelo: I'd guess he's just not aware of/forgot about the publishing schedule
