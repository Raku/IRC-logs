[20:00] <sena_kun> we are not in a hurry, anyway, I think

[20:01] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: also, can you confirm that the CLA was received? I can easily take sena_kun's word for it, but let's make it easier for moritz :)

[20:01] <sena_kun> I wasn't able to see how sake all runs without errors yet. :]

[20:02] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel I think it was roast pass, so maybe a flapper. it was too late already for me and I decided "well, ok, I'll look at it more next time".

[20:02] <sena_kun> I was able to sort out gpg2 issues and plan to write ssh-related patch before that

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: it runs each flavor of spectest 3 or 4 times to avoid flappers, if it failed it's likely a broken spectest

[20:03] <sena_kun> :S

[20:03] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, I'll ask later with logs at hands then

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: when it stops, it'll usually end with a backtrace, you can then look which line failed and you'll see which spectest it was

[20:04] <sena_kun> have to hurry with preparations of some stuff for tomorrow...

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> this is normal, sometimes a test in 6.c or 6.d stops working before anybody else notices

[20:05] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I received sena_kun's CLA

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> thanks!

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I'm now running it on my side too and we'll see if I can reproduce

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> masak: or maybe you can give sena_kun a commit bit to rakudo?

[20:09] <AlexDaniel> also you should probably tweak the org name to just Rakudo (not Rakudo Perl)

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> to clarify, I only have enough privs for the rakudo repo, not the org, so I can't do that

[21:48] <jnthn> .tell Xliff maybe override something in the role meta-object, such as in spcialize, so that when it sees the target of the composition, it checks if its meta-object does some role, and if not, mixes it in?
