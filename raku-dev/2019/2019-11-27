[00:44] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: nice

[00:46] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I'm trying to stick 6.e labels to where they applicable, but could miss some issues. So, if you think something worth planning for 6.e...

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I don't know of any blockers for 6.e

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't mean we have to do everything

[00:49] <vrurg> Sure we don't. The point of the project is to track whatever we consider ok to be part of 6.e

[00:50] * vrurg could probably find things planned for 6.d which are gonna be postponed to 6.f... ;)

[01:48] <vrurg> Sorry, but will only be able to fix it tomorrow. :(

[01:50] <vrurg> A quick work around for this is wiping out nqp subdir.

[16:01] <japhb> [Coke]: OOC, why Date.new(now) instead of Date.today?  Delta carrying the formatter around they're equivalent, but the latter seems clearer in that it hides the conversion from Instant.

[16:04] <[Coke]> was shorter to type. :)

[16:04] <[Coke]> I agree, .today is clearer

[20:19] <japhb> vrurg: Yup, git pull --tags fixed.  After reading through the git pull and git fetch docs, I have to say: WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE THAT LEVER?

[20:20] * [Coke] remembers writing docs for work that explained that --all didn't include --tags.

[20:20] <japhb> Also, I wonder what got lost in the release that this wasn't automatic ... no merge of the release branch back to master maybe?  That's what glg seems to be indicating.

[20:21] <japhb> [Coke]: "But why?" -- this is one of those "goofy default" cases.

[20:24] <vrurg> japhb: did you do pull manually?

[20:58] <japhb> vrurg: I have a script that pulls and rebuilds everything from scratch.  (It doesn't pull into working directories; it pulls into bare repos, and then local-clones them into build dirs, checks out HEAD or a requested rev, and builds from there.)

[20:59] <japhb> Basically I have seen the entire history of utterly broken builds, and so the script has been slowly bullet-proofed over years for every time someone messes with the repos.  :-/

[21:01] <japhb> I've lost count of the number of times the official recommendation was "Welp, blow away your checkout and try again" -- which was after the "Always git clean -dXf" era

[21:02] <vrurg> japhb: I was wondering to know if the pull which Configure.pl does needs --tags too.

[21:02] * vrurg is afk

[21:02] <japhb> vrurg: Seems wise.  :-)

[21:04] <japhb> TBH if not for the network cost of pulling down repos at this point, I might just clone my build trees completely from scratch from GH.  On the (now-rare) occasions I hack on rakudo itself, I have a separate clone for that.

[22:00] <japhb> Perspective on disk space is a little different at japhb.dayjob ...

[22:00] <japhb> But even at home, Costco's cheapo backup drives are now bigger than I actually need.

[22:01] <japhb> I suppose if I was trying to build a server farm out of pocket, it would add up.  :-)
