[13:34] <vrurg> nine: just for the record: what I currently surmise is that core.setting is not serialized with a unit sc. But when unit itself is deserialized it fixes this with load deps task. But if an object from that unit is repossessed – there is nobody to attach correct core to its outers.

[13:44] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: nice work, thnx!

[13:44] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: don't use -m

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: first line is a title, then an empty line, then a useful description

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> realistically there's no easy way to do that if you use -m

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> if you don't use -m, git will open a text editor where you can write the commit message properly

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> which text editor it opens is configurable, in my case for example that's emacs because that's what I use

[13:49] <tbrowder> what i've done in the past is use "git commit -F file.log"

[13:53] <tbrowder> with this pr i had to commit in pieces because of various mistakes. but it was to my branch and i've seen git allows an overall merge msg so i thought that was satisfactory.

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> -F – Yeah, well, that's a hard way to do it

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> as for fixing mistakes in your branch `git commit --amend` and `git rebase -i`

[13:54] <tbrowder> in the future, on my end, should i incrementally merge master into my branch during work for the pr?

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> no

[13:55] <tbrowder> i'm really sorry about the snafu. i usually do a full spec test before the pr but got sloppy.

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> what you can do is rebase your commits on top of master

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> but generally you don't need that

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> well, you do if your commits are very old…

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> to visualize, these are your commits:

[13:59] * AlexDaniel` uploaded an image: image.png (2KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/alexdaniel.org/HaXnAGYYPqsmDirIhZffKoJw >

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> that blue lines goes back several *months*

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> and everything else looks confusing too

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> functionally it doesn't matter, but if everyone starts doing that our git history will look like something from nightmares :)

[14:00] <tbrowder> aarg!

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: I think this was a nice resource, probably still is: https://learngitbranching.js.org/

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> there are a few great excercises on how to rebase and juggle with commits

[14:02] <tbrowder> ok, but the -F log seems easier than the interactive--keep notes as one goes along.

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: perhaps, but I never needed that because I can always just look at the diff of what I've done

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> `git diff` to see what was changed and `git diff --staged` to see what I'm about to commit

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> and after commiting `git show` to see the last commit before I push

[14:06] <tbrowder> yeah, i use the git diff regularly, but haven't used --staged

[14:06] <nine> vrurg: also my message was bogus anywhere. Your bug is all about precompilation. I just confused it with the other issue I'm looking into

[14:08] <vrurg> I should not forget to commit the fix later anyway.

[18:21] <nine> Finally!

[18:25] <nine> The new magic incantation that fixes things is: $*W.context().sub_id_to_code_object(){nqp::getcodecuid(nqp::getattr(self, Code, '$!do'))} := -> {} if $*W;

[18:41] <nine> AlexDaniel: this is about the NativeCall regression ^^^

[18:42] <nine> So what's happening is that while we replace the routine's $!do (the actual code body) when we apply the native trait, $*W.compile_in_context will replace it again with the original routine. compile_in_context is used for evaluating BEGIN blocks and also role bodies during compilation.

[18:43] <nine> The line I just posted deflects that into the empty code block, so our replacement $!do stays intact.
