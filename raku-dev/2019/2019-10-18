[13:34] <vrurg> nine: just for the record: what I currently surmise is that core.setting is not serialized with a unit sc. But when unit itself is deserialized it fixes this with load deps task. But if an object from that unit is repossessed ‚Äì there is nobody to attach correct core to its outers.

[13:44] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: nice work, thnx!

[13:44] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: don't use -m

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: first line is a title, then an empty line, then a useful description

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> realistically there's no easy way to do that if you use -m

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> if you don't use -m, git will open a text editor where you can write the commit message properly

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> which text editor it opens is configurable, in my case for example that's emacs because that's what I use

[13:49] <tbrowder> what i've done in the past is use "git commit -F file.log"

[13:53] <tbrowder> with this pr i had to commit in pieces because of various mistakes. but it was to my branch and i've seen git allows an overall merge msg so i thought that was satisfactory.

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> -F ‚Äì Yeah, well, that's a hard way to do it

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> as for fixing mistakes in your branch `git commit --amend` and `git rebase -i`

[13:54] <tbrowder> in the future, on my end, should i incrementally merge master into my branch during work for the pr?

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> no

[13:55] <tbrowder> i'm really sorry about the snafu. i usually do a full spec test before the pr but got sloppy.

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> what you can do is rebase your commits on top of master

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> but generally you don't need that

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> well, you do if your commits are very old‚Ä¶

[13:59] <AlexDaniel`> to visualize, these are your commits:

[13:59] * AlexDaniel` uploaded an image: image.png (2KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/alexdaniel.org/HaXnAGYYPqsmDirIhZffKoJw >

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> that blue lines goes back several *months*

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> and everything else looks confusing too

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> functionally it doesn't matter, but if everyone starts doing that our git history will look like something from nightmares :)

[14:00] <tbrowder> aarg!

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: I think this was a nice resource, probably still is: https://learngitbranching.js.org/

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> there are a few great excercises on how to rebase and juggle with commits

[14:02] <tbrowder> ok, but the -F log seems easier than the interactive--keep notes as one goes along.

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: perhaps, but I never needed that because I can always just look at the diff of what I've done

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> `git diff` to see what was changed and `git diff --staged` to see what I'm about to commit

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> and after commiting `git show` to see the last commit before I push

[14:06] <tbrowder> yeah, i use the git diff regularly, but haven't used --staged

[14:06] <nine> vrurg: also my message was bogus anywhere. Your bug is all about precompilation. I just confused it with the other issue I'm looking into

[14:08] <vrurg> I should not forget to commit the fix later anyway.

[14:15] *** pmurias left
[14:16] <vrurg> If I'm correct about core setting not been re-attached to resposessed closures, then it means same bug must happen if closure is referring to a symbol from another module. Need to check it when have time...

[18:21] <nine> Finally!

[18:25] <nine> The new magic incantation that fixes things is: $*W.context().sub_id_to_code_object(){nqp::getcodecuid(nqp::getattr(self, Code, '$!do'))} := -> {} if $*W;

[18:41] <nine> AlexDaniel: this is about the NativeCall regression ^^^

[18:42] <nine> So what's happening is that while we replace the routine's $!do (the actual code body) when we apply the native trait, $*W.compile_in_context will replace it again with the original routine. compile_in_context is used for evaluating BEGIN blocks and also role bodies during compilation.

[18:43] <nine> The line I just posted deflects that into the empty code block, so our replacement $!do stays intact.
