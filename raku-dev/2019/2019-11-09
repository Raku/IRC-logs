[00:12] <tbrowder> i thought one of the problems was not knowing if a PR to master passed roast. problems with Blin is another story altogether.

[00:13] <tbrowder> so extending a build time to allow roasting would be a big win.

[00:16] <tbrowder> e.g., my premature PR merge

[13:11] <tbrowder> El_Che: i can't say on travis, but, without inline5 it takes only 8-10 minutes on my super new laptop; but, based on time i've seen to build and basic tests on travis, it would take quite a while longer

[13:11] <tbrowder> on travis

[13:17] <tbrowder> why don't one of you release folks call Jan

[13:19] <tbrowder> maybe make a conf call between AlexDaniel and crew and Jan

[13:19] <tbrowder> the tone of email was very helpful and willing to accomodate

[13:20] <tbrowder> i need to reply something

[13:54] <tbrowder> okay, i have replied to Jan saying i recommend increasing build time for repo rakudo/rakudo while release managers are discussing the situation

[13:55] <rba> AlexDaniel`, tbrowder: Not sure if I can help with the discussion about increasing build time.

[13:56] <tbrowder> ok,

[13:59] <tbrowder> i obviously don't understand the mechanics of the build when we do a commit but at least we maybe can see an increase in allowable time. maybe one of the folks intimately involved in tooling can find a way to add roast testing in the .travis.yml file

[14:08] <tbrowder> i just tried to search #perl6-dev and couldn't. are the old irc logs avail somewhere?

[14:17] <moritz> tbrowder: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6-dev

[14:19] <tbrowder> moritz: thanks!

[14:30] <tbrowder> from the search in irc #perl i remember tony-o is the expert who could help with adding roast. he showed me a .travis.yml setup for greatly speeding up testing modules. i'll bet he can build a setup using roast master for testing a PR or commit to rakudo master.

[14:32] <tbrowder> .ask tony-o is it possible to add the roast master branch to the build testing for a rakudo PR?

[14:32] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tony-o

[14:56] <tbrowder> hm, looking at the .travis.yml in rakudo/rakudo now: i'll experiment with a PR for it to add roast and add tony-o's linux image

[15:28] <tbrowder> i see i'm confusing thngs as usual, just need to add roast as the final testing step

[15:37] <El_Che> If help is needed feel free to ping me. Got to know travis pretty well for the rakudo-pkg usecase. Now looking how we can test on mac and windows as well.

[15:37] <El_Che> The only thing that will piss people off when using travis are the flappers

[18:36] <tbrowder> well, couldn't we somehow bypass known flappers in roast with a suitable flag? but i haven't noticed any roast flappers in my local spectesting.
