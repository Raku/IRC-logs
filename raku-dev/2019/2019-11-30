[00:00] <AlexDaniel> oh, there's also Sequence and HyperSeq/RaceSeq

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> at least that's what the docssay

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> docs say*

[00:01] <jnthn> Sure

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> .oO( Tonight on Raku FM: AlexDaniel learns the basics of Rakuâ€¦ )

[00:03] <jnthn> :)

[00:06] <jnthn> To be fair, for the range of functionality being made available, I don't think we're doing any worse than other languages whose standard library (or libraries that may as well be) provide the same.

[00:07] <Xliff> .oO( This is a silly radio show. I thought those were the same basics as Perl6! )

[00:07] <Xliff> Please pardon the impending snark... I am dealing with Bluehost support for $dayjob and they are giving me the runaround.

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: hypothetically, what if Seq and List were the same thing?

[00:08] <jnthn> I think it maybe just surprises folks a bit more in Raku to discover them all, because one just does `@foo.race.map(*.blah)` and doesn't even thing that much about the types involved.

[00:08] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Memory leaks all over :)

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: I mean, what if List was Seq? :)

[00:08] <jnthn> I know because *we used to have it that way*!

[00:09] <tbrowder> jnthn: lizmat has asked for yr review of my PR 3310 when you get a chance. it implements log2 routine.

[00:09] <tellable6> 2019-11-29T08:26:21Z #raku <jmerelo> tbrowder great job!

[00:09] <jnthn> If List was Seq...I dunno how one'd achieve that, given Seq uses List as part of its cache implementation

[00:09] <Xliff> Memory leaks? How about brain leaks?!

[00:10] <Xliff> Mine are coming out my ear...

[00:10] <jnthn> It may be possible, but I'm not sure how practical it is

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> okay

[18:42] <Xliff> vrurg: OK. But it's being applied to a single role. So I guess a group can be 1, yes?

[18:43] <lizmat> Xliff: I think so

[18:44] <lizmat> it's easier on the compiler logic, because during parsing you don't know how many roles you're going to encounter

[18:44] <lizmat> so you always start with a group

[20:30] <Xliff> OK, now here's the current problem. Previously roles would return ParametricRoleHow both as $*PACKAGE and then when referred to by name.

[20:31] <Xliff> Now $*PACKAGE is still ParametricRoleHOW, but the role by name is now ParametricRoleGroupHOW.

[20:31] <Xliff> This breaks things down the line.

[20:31] <Xliff> What's the best way to resolve? Preferably given the ability to pun roles on ParametricRoleGroupHOW when given the ParametricRoleHOW?

[20:33] <vrurg> Xliff: I don't understand what you're trying to achieve

[20:35] <vrurg> And a role by name was always a group.

[20:46] <Xliff> Well, something recent changed with roles because Method::Also isn't working when attaching aliases via role.

[20:47] <Xliff> Right now, I can't figure out why.

[20:48] <Xliff> Right now I am attaching aliases to a class with roles via specialize and specialize-with

[20:48] <Xliff> And they are not getting picked up.

[20:48] <Xliff> They were, last week.

[20:48] <Xliff> Or maybe the week before. Kinda hard to tell. I have lots of projects, now.

[22:24] <Xliff> vrurg: OK, the culprit is easy. The aliases in the roles are not getting composed.

[22:25] <Xliff> And at least from what I can see, this means that AliasableRoleHOW.specialize is not being called at all.

[22:26] <Xliff> I know all of the defined role HOWs are being punned with it, so what would cause that to not execute?

[22:31] <jnthn> Xliff: fwiw, I don't think there's - for probbly close to a decade - been a time when a role name didn't evaluate to a ParametricRoleGroupHOW

[22:37] <Xliff> jnthn: Thanks for that. It means my initial suspicion was incorrect. However this code worked as recently as 2 weeks ago and it hasn't changed. I've already had to fix something in it once due to a weird change.
