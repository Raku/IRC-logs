[00:16] <tbrowder> would it be feasible, or practical, to have PRs to the master branch always be run with "make spectest" on travis?

[00:18] <vrurg> tbrowder: spectest is very slow and we're limited with 1hr timeframe.

[00:19] <vrurg> s/very slow/takes long/

[00:20] <tbrowder> ok, thnx, i'm sure that's not an original idea!

[00:20] <vrurg> Not really :)

[00:20] *** softmoth left
[00:21] *** softmoth joined
[00:22] <tbrowder> ok, how about running our own test facility somehow magically through the power of git hooks?

[00:23] <vrurg> tbrowder: if we have a server for this, I'd appreciate it very much.

[00:24] <tbrowder> i've offered one before but no one was interested.

[00:24] <AlexDaniel> it's not about having a machine, it's about setting it up

[00:24] <vrurg> But the problem is somewhat more compilcated than just having a server and installing it. What platform would we run on it? Linux most obiously. But what about macOS and Win?

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> and that too, yes :(

[00:25] <vrurg> The only good solution is getting pro accounts on tracis and appveyor.

[00:25] <tbrowder> ah, vms?

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: fwiw I don't even check the spectest on windows, tests were failing there before I started making releases

[00:26] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: here's a newer ticket: https://github.com/perl6/roast/issues/504

[00:26] <AlexDaniel> and there was another one somewhere before that

[00:26] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: things were at very good shape a month or two ago. Don't know how it goes currently. I don't run them often too.

[00:26] <tbrowder> vrug: i'll check on it

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also, spectest used to work on jvm at some point, but I don't think it does anymore

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> again, when I started making releases it didn't work, so I never run spectest on jvm too‚Ä¶

[00:27] <vrurg> JVM is broken for at least half a year or so.

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> I do check that jvm runs -e 'say 42' though :)

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> no way?

[00:28] <vrurg> tbrowder: that'd be great. We miss quite a coule of issues without complete testing.

[00:28] <discord6> <noelsken> there's a bug in create-jvm-runner at least

[00:28] * AlexDaniel builds

[00:29] <vrurg> no way ‚Äì for what? Fixing it?

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> no way it doesn't work for half a year

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> last release was 2019.07, you sure it doesn't work there?

[00:30] <vrurg> spectests? Did you try? I don't remember the last time they were working for me with JVM. 

[00:30] <vrurg> At some point some tests gets stuck.

[00:30] <discord6> <noelsken> I applied this patch here to install r-j https://pastebin.com/V9aePwGL

[00:30] <discord6> <noelsken> otherwise perl6-j is broken

[00:30] <discord6> <noelsken> spectest breaks somewhen in between but that's on the evalserver

[00:31] <discord6> <noelsken> it works - albeit really slowly - when running perl6-j directly

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: ah, well, spectests were not working for a long time

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> but you said ‚ÄúJVM is broke‚Äù :)

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> n

[00:31] <discord6> <noelsken> but the eval server grinding to a halt eventually speaks ill of r-j's potential for long-running programs

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: point is, I at least make sure that a hello world runs

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> there are times when rakudo on jvm is more broken :)

[00:32] <vrurg> noelsken: could you make a PR for that, pls? I can't read the patch because it's wrapped and requres kinda char-by-char comparison.

[00:33] <discord6> <noelsken> vrurg: sure, just gotta clone on github and reset origin, gimme a bit

[00:33] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: me too. But I can only do it for macOS and Linux. JVM never worked in my half-dead Windows VM. OpenBSD VM I just got installed and I don't to spend too much time on it.

[00:35] <vrurg> noelsken: I'd like to ask you to explain what's wrong and why PR is needed. Either open an issue or add a comment on PR. Both will do for me. Thank you!

[00:36] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: BTW, I got OpenBSD install fixed. Must admit that this make gives me a tick on my eye. How come does it manage to do prereqs out of the order they're specified with .NOTPARALLEL ‚Äì it's out of my understanding! :(

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: usually there are many openbsd users willing to help, even if it's a bit surprising. Maybe open a ticket and someone will be able to explain what's going on?

[00:39] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I work around it by explicitly making install-main target depend on install-pre. I would work anywhere in either case.

[00:40] <vrurg> I'm more interested in merging #3248 but it requires https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/586 and NQP bump will be needed. Shall I merge the latter and wait for the next bump? 

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yep

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> I can bump it for you :)

[00:43] <vrurg> NP, I can do it on my own. Just wanna be sure I break nothing with it.

[00:43] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: well, if you're worried about the PR itself, maybe a good idea to wait until the release?

[00:44] <AlexDaniel> most blockers have disappeared thanks to nine++

[01:03] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: minus one blocker. Unless kaipei finds more peculiarities of OpenBSD. ;)

[01:05] <vrurg> But then I at least will have pre-installed ready to go VM next time. It takes hours to get OpenBSD into a working shape... :(

[01:06] <AlexDaniel> yaay

[01:44] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: if you fork the release I'll try to put my commits into the changelog. Though it's gonna be a little scary task. ;)

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: btw I moved it back to the wiki: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> draft releases have no edit history, unfortunately :(

[01:50] <vrurg> Ok, good to know.

[01:50] <AlexDaniel> and this is back to normal! :)

[01:52] <vrurg> BTW, ugexe confirms that 3157 is fixed. Shall we close it and fork the release?

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: dnoe

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> done!

[01:59] <AlexDaniel> wait how come we're at 0 blockers

[01:59] <AlexDaniel> :D

[01:59] <AlexDaniel> that was quick, I thought there's something else‚Ä¶

[02:00] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I see you're having so much fun with word distances that can't stop experimenting with typos? :D

[02:00] <AlexDaniel> just my sloppy typing :)

[02:00] * vrurg is kidding, of course. :)

[02:01] <vrurg> Happens to me all the time when thinking is faster than typing...

[05:43] <bartolin> for the record: I didn't see a major breakage for the JVM backend during the last weeks (FreeBSD, using gmake). Only a few files have problems during spectest. I don't use the Evalserver, but something like 'TEST_JOBS=1 perl t/spec/test_summary rakudo.jvm'. The Evalserver has been leaking resources for a long time -- reported as RT #132104. I'm not aware of a general memory leak of rakudo-j, though.
