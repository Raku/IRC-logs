[11:19] <lizmat> so, what does this error actually mean?

[11:19] <lizmat> Deprecated use of %*LANG<dynamic-scope> assignment detected in use; module should export syntax using $*LANG.define_slang("dynamic-scope",<grammar>,<actions>) instead

[11:19] <lizmat>   (value in braid: BOOTCode, value in %*LANG: BOOTCode)

[11:20] <lizmat> it seems to occur when a some of my P5 modules are used inside a pre-compiled module, aka P5built-ins

[11:21] <lizmat> specifically P5getservbyname, P5math and P5-X

[11:22] <jnthn> Do they make use of slangs somehow?

[11:29] <jnthn> Ah, though looking at the name...I wonder if it's about the dynamic $_ mechanism

[11:35] <lizmat> jnthn: yeah, but it only complains about those 3 modules

[11:35] <lizmat> and many modules make use of the $_ mechanism

[11:36] <lizmat> it feels to me, it is some kind of corruption going on

[11:36] * lizmat tries to change the order of module loading to see if that makes a difference

[11:36] <jnthn> Doubt it, I suspect just some of them hit the path that triggers the deprecation check

[11:38] <lizmat> well, P5getservbyname and P5getnetbyname are basically the same, but call differen libc functions

[11:38] <lizmat> yet P5getservbyname complains, and P5getnetbyname doesn't

[11:40] <lizmat> also, just loading the module separately, does not make that message appear

[11:40] <lizmat> only if that module is used *inside* of another module being precomped

[11:41] <lizmat> oops... user error, it wasn't P5getservbyname

[11:42] <lizmat> P5print is the one, which support your $_ theory, jnthn 

[11:44] <lizmat> ok, looks like "my sub term:<> is export" is the cause in that case

[11:45] <jnthn> Ah, and that is a language tweak (adding a new term) so would feasibly trigger the deprecation check too

[11:45] <lizmat> yeah, so it looks like exporting a term into a precomped module is not doing it right

[11:46] <lizmat> ah, and P5-X is doing sub prefix:<> is export

[11:47] <lizmat> ah, and P5seek is also doing a sub term:<> is export

[11:47] <lizmat> ok, so they all share the same issue

[11:48] <lizmat> jnthn: now where in the bowels, would I find this ?

[11:48] <lizmat> any hints?

[11:48] <jnthn> grep for dynamic-scope as a starting point

[11:51] <lizmat> restarted the one failing job

[11:53] <lizmat> jnthn: so it looks like it is doing a: $*LANG.set_pragma('dynamic-scope'

[11:53] <lizmat> but it is not actually setting %*LANG<dynamic-scope> there

[11:53] <lizmat> so I guess it's inside .set_pragme

[11:54] <jnthn> Hmm, curious...

[23:38] <jnthn> 'CUS IT'S EXCITING! ;)

[23:41] <[Coke]> jnthn: :P

[23:44] * vrurg is blush

[23:45] <vrurg> jnthn: BTW, would would you say if I make find_method_qualified method return not only method itself but the concrete type object it was found on?

[23:46] <vrurg> *what would

[23:46] <jnthn> Hm, why?

[23:46] <jnthn> It feels odd to me

[23:46] <jnthn> Can't you query that by doing .package on the returned method?

[23:47] <vrurg> jnthn: .package would return non-concrete, AFAIR.

[23:48] <vrurg> I'm trying to get a proper fix for qualified calls. They're currently flawed as they might pick up incorrect role.

[23:48] <jnthn> Hm, what do you mean specifically by "concrete type object"?

[23:48] <jnthn> m: role R { method m() { } }; class C does R { }; C.^lookup('m').package.say

[23:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar a62d9c785: OUTPUT: «(R)␤»

[23:49] <jnthn> Ah, right, that's a declarative property

[23:49] <jnthn> m: role R { method m() { } }; class C does R { }; C.^lookup('m').signature.params[0].type.say

[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar a62d9c785: OUTPUT: «(C)␤»

[23:49] <vrurg> It could be either role conretization or $qtype itself, depending if concretization is possible.

[23:49] <jnthn> That's...hacky though :)

[23:50] <jnthn> I think it'd want some kind of new API rather than changing the return value of the existing one, anyway.

[23:50] <jnthn> Though I do wonder if there's a way to pass something as an option to find_method_qualified so *it* can do the check and just not return the method if it doesn't match up to that?

[23:51] *** lucasb left
[23:51] <vrurg> jnthn: The problem is a bit more complex than that. Let me find the gist which demoes part of the problem.

[23:52] <vrurg> https://gist.github.com/vrurg/1063b8a6226025a9461e1f405edb9f5d

[23:52] <vrurg> m: https://gist.github.com/vrurg/1063b8a6226025a9461e1f405edb9f5d

[23:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar a62d9c785: OUTPUT: «--- Foo::foo␤Foo a==1␤Foo!a: 1␤R::info ::?CLASS: (Foo)␤--- Bar::foo␤1. Bar a==1␤Foo a==2␤Foo!a: 0␤R::info ::?CLASS: (Bar)␤2. Bar a==2␤»

[23:52] <vrurg> This is just one issue: parent class referring same role as it's child gets qualification pointing at child's concretization.

[23:53] <jnthn> Ah

[23:53] <jnthn> Um, I'm surprised that `self.Foo::R::info` even works

[23:54] <vrurg> Worse happens if class consumes a parameterized role and another role which consumes another parameterization of the same role.

[23:54] <jnthn> Yeah, that's an interesting problem...

[23:55] <jnthn> Wonder if it's solvable by giving find_method_qualified a :from, and we pass the enclosing package.

[23:55] <vrurg> So, dispatch of :: must preserve the concrete type object it used to resolve a method in order for any subsequent dispatch to know where to look.

[23:56] <vrurg> jnthn: find_method_qualified doesn't need it. 

[23:57] <jnthn> So...what does?

[23:57] <jnthn> The thing that finds concretizations?

[23:57] <vrurg> dispatch:<::>. I provide it with ::?CALLER-TYPE from upstream in Actions and it kinda works.

[23:58] <vrurg> Right, I currently see no other option but to replace it with a dynamic $*CALLER-TYPE or alike and upstream dispatcher would set it to the concretization.

[23:59] <vrurg> Compile-time is obviously faster, but, unfortunately, only run-time knows the correct answer. :(
