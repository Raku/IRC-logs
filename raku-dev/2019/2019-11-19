[14:19] <tbrowder> hi, looking to add a festure req and see labels are getting out of hand

[14:22] <tbrowder> can they be locked so not easily changed? also nice to reduce them to smaller set and change the existing labels on issues accordingly

[14:23] <tbrowder> much duplication i see

[14:25] <jnthn> Example of a duplicate? I just looked through them and while maybe there's the odd one I'd question, overall most of them look to have a use.

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> ha! Some people have reverse engineered sony video cameras a little. For example, you can now pull some internal files from the camera. There's a file called Backup.bin which stores all your current camera settings and stuff. So I opened that file with GIMP and was greeted by this face: https://github.com/ma1co/OpenMemories-Tweak/issues/1#issuecomment-555598735

[17:57] <moritz> AlexDaniel: fun times to be alive :D

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> it's a 80x80 grayscale image which is pretty much useless in camera terms, so I'm sure it's not used for anything real.

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> someone just decided to put that in

[18:05] <AlexDaniel> it's like if one day you opened stage0 in gimp and saw jnthn's face :D

[18:28] <lucasb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Labels

[18:29] <lucasb> ^^ I created, to help us discuss and organize things better

[18:30] <lucasb> but those labels "grow organically", you know

[18:35] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: I understand the cuteness of short labels but at some point “wtf does this mean” labels were given proper names

[18:35] <AlexDaniel> so let's not go back

[18:40] <lucasb> AlexDaniel: you mean the "single word names"? Maybe I should reword that. I'm *not* in favor of new cute and inventive names :)

[18:40] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: yeah, but I'd much rather prefer multiple words than a single word that is unclear

[18:41] <lucasb> agreed

[18:43] <AlexDaniel> actually, I take it back, it could be something non-easter-eggy. Maybe Sony's software decided to somehow engrave previous owner's avatar into the internal backup file.

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> factory reset doesn't wipe it, so it's funny either way, but I was unable to find a face on another identical camera
