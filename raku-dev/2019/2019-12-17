[08:32] <nine> Intriguingly the new csv-ip5xs.pl issue is much easier to reproduce with the JIT disabled and appears even with spesh disabled, despite appearing only after a lot of successful runs of the loop. Makes me suspect some GC related issue.

[08:36] <nine> Alas, setting MVM_GC_DEBUG to 3 doesn't seem to provoke it either

[17:38] <jmerelo> I'm trying to wrap my head around this change in raku 6.d: "Native attributes can be used as bind targets in parameters rakudo"

[17:38] <jmerelo> If I understand it correctly, it means that you can bind parameters to a native attribute, for instance in a submethod like here:

[17:39] <jmerelo> m: class Foo { has num $.numillo; submethod BUILD( :$!numillo = 3.5e0 ) {}}; say Foo.new.perl

[17:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «Foo.new(numillo => 3.5e0)␤»

[17:39] <jmerelo> However, the problem is that that particular way of working has been there since 2016.10, way before 6.d https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/c3552d352996a6cff67bb4ee596cc90d

[17:43] <jnthn> jmerelo: But the previous language release was 6.c, in 2015.12, so in terms of language releases 6.c is the first one it appears in.

[17:44] <jmerelo> jnthn: so that means that was simply implemented early and the example is correct

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> I guess 6.c didn't have any tests for it one way or another, and 6.d now has tests for that feature

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> which is how rakudo got away implementing it early

[17:45] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Oh, great. Thanks!

[17:59] <jnthn> Not really sure what "implemented early" means; by definition, everything must be implemented before it can appear in a language release. :)

[17:59] <jnthn> (Since a feature must have been proven implementable by at least one implementation.)

[18:02] <jmerelo> jnthn: I kinda thought that features mentioned in 6.d would be available in 2018.11 or shortly before. I was wrong.

[18:03] <jmerelo> zef search returns only versions in the local cache, which are a newer version.

[20:33] <patrickb> rba: Looks good. Thanks!

[20:36] <rba> patrickb: somewhat the "binary" all release is now pointing to github, where there are no binaryies.

[20:38] <rba> patrickb: may we ajust the redirects in the nginx.conf as well?

[20:40] <patrickb> rba: There are no binaries yet at all! We still have to create and upload some.

[20:40] <rba> patrickb: so where to put the binaries? on github?

[20:41] <patrickb> We could do both. Then we keep the backup aspect of github.

[20:43] <rba> patrickb: If I click on the MacOS tab on "All releases" under "Binary Releases" I would expect to find the latest (or all) prebuilt dmg archives I can just download. 

[20:43] <patrickb> rba: They would show up right there if there were any releases on the server.

[20:44] <rba> Ok and where I need to put them?

[20:44] <rba> Let's do it.

[20:44] <patrickb> same folder the src files are in

[20:46] <MasterDuke> pmurias: think it would make sense to try and have rakudo listed here? https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-graal

[20:46] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to pmurias

[20:47] <rba> patrickb: Sorry, I see the issue. We have only rakudo star as .dmg and .msi.

[20:48] <patrickb> rba: Rakudo gained the ability to have relocatable builds only in the latest release. So there is no process of creating the binary packages established yet.

[20:49] <patrickb> El_Che is working on automating that task.

[20:50] <patrickb> rba: I can create archives for Windows and Linux. I have no access to a MacOS machine though.

[20:50] <rba> patrickb: MacOS is comming :-) I see the point.

[20:52] <[Coke]> there are some folks in channel with macs would would probably volunteer to test something.

[20:52] <rba> patrickb: With the idea in mind that we are on the way to glue the rakudo.org website into a docker container as well, we might quickly think how to map the folder with the downloadable binaries into it.

[20:53] <patrickb> .tell El_Che The rakudo-pkg releases are missing the files in rakudo-repo/tools/binary-release/Linux.

[20:53] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[20:53] <rba> [Coke]: I have MacMini resting around. But I need to put it into a separate network before giving access to community members.

[20:54] *** sena_kun left
[20:55] <rba> Idea would be to involve it somehow into a pipline to do automated builds for MacOS as well.

[20:56] <patrickb> .tell El_Che The rakudo-pkg files are now named "rakudo-moarvm-2019.11-..." instead of "rakudo-moar-2019.11-..." different from what I answered you. Was that accidental? (I don't really prefer one over the other, we just have to keep it consistent)

[20:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to El_Che

[20:56] <patrickb> rba: El_Che is currently utilizing Travis as the platform to create the packages automatically.
