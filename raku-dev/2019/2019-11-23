[00:36] <samcv> is anyone against having rakudo have a text description in a Proc exception for signals? like SIGKILL is one signal that can cause it to throw if it's not sunk.

[00:36] <samcv> I was considering adding that. atm it just will tell you a number of the signal it got, which is not too helpful

[01:57] <tbrowder> any objections to merging my Rakudo PRs 3310, 3260, or 3253?

[14:15] <masak> greetings

[14:15] <masak> I've been getting back into Perl 5 recently

[14:16] <masak> it's been going well, but... I just found that this is not a valid thing to write in Perl 5:

[14:16] <masak> `if ((my $x = 5) == 5 && $x > 2) {}`

[14:16] <masak> I am so upset right now :)

[14:17] <masak> TimToady isn't even here so I can slap him with a large trout of 20-20 hindsight

[14:18] <masak> s/so I can/for me to/

[14:18] *** Voldenet left
[14:20] <masak> moritz: <3

[14:21] <masak> moritz: I still find bugs in the same way, but I don't have the focus/time to minimize them and report them, nor the time for frolicking play that tends to precede bug finding

[14:26] <nine> I'm kinda considering making Distribution::Resource.Str blow up. I can't think of a good use for that method and it seems to be abused widely in connection with NativeCall

[14:26] <masak> nine: what are those abuses? I'm curious.

[14:26] <masak> and what'd be the correct use?

[14:27] <nine> As in: my constant LIBLINENOISE = %?RESOURCES<libraries/linenoise>.Str; our sub linenoiseHistoryAdd(Str $line) is native(LIBLINENOISE) is export { * }

[14:27] *** Voldenet joined
[14:27] *** Voldenet left
[14:27] *** Voldenet joined
[14:28] <nine> This will cause the full absolute path to liblinenoise.so from the repository to be part of the precomp file. This in turn breaks when that precomp file gets moved, e.g. when it's created using the Staging repository during packaging and installed by copying the resulting file into the appropriate destination.

[14:28] <masak> ah.

[14:28] <masak> subtle.

[14:28] <nine> There's absolutely no reason for that .Str call there. One can just remove it and the packaging issue will be solved.

[14:28] <masak> not sure it merits a blowup, but certainly a warning, yes.

[14:30] <nine> Sadly that still wont prevent crazyness like: https://github.com/hoelzro/p6-linenoise/blob/master/lib/Linenoise.pm6.in#L15

[14:31] <nine> People seem to believe, that one needs to do crazy stunts to achieve trivial things with regards to NativeCall.

[14:31] <masak> sounds like an education problem more than anything else

[14:31] <masak> how to raise all boats? :)

[14:35] * masak glares at p5 sigil variance

[14:50] <nine> I don't understand how people even come up with that .Str. There's nothing about it in the docs. There's plenty of bad and wrong advise in the docs, but not this.

[14:57] *** ExtraCrispy joined
[14:59] <masak> users are the worst :P

[15:08] <tbrowder> can someone please walk me through reverting my PR #3260 which now fails testing? (or revert it yourself).

[17:47] <japhb> nine: hoelzro may have written that before NativeCall did the necessary magic.  It looks like that code was written ~4.5 years ago, and I vaguely recall lib-finding to be pretty hackish back then.

[19:08] <nine> japhb: all the more reason to remove that code for good

[19:13] <japhb> nine: Oh, I wasn't saying it shouldn't be removed/replaced, rather that we can't assume it was unnecessary *at the time*, and it's likely that a lot of the other cases of "doing things the hard/wrong way" for Nativecall bits are cargo culting from earlier modules that needed it at the time they were written.

[19:33] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: ping?

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> pong

[19:34] <vrurg> On github it'd take too much time. :) I don't like squashing because it actually means squashing everything.

[19:34] <vrurg> Maybe I'd make another PR specifically for the release branch?

[19:35] <vrurg> It would be totally same as I'd just branch off the current PR.

[19:41] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: why not squash everything?

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: the PR currently includes a bunch of irrelevant commits

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> like multiple submodule updates

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> and even the implementation was going back and forth with raku/rakudo changes

[19:43] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: call it 'religious prejudice'. I'd like to keep the history.

[19:43] <vrurg> submodule updates could be squashed, that I thought about.

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> you can keep the history in your local branch, and squash things for the PR :)

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> I don't really need you to rebase it for the release branch, I can probably cherry-pick on my own, I just don't like the clutter

[19:45] <AlexDaniel> but every single commit will be doubled in history

[19:45] <AlexDaniel> which is not too bad if there are only a few, but 14‚Ä¶

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> surely some commits can be separate, like the RAKU_HOME one

[19:46] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: that's why I propose a separate PR. The release branch is a dead-end, it'd be ok to have alternate history with it.

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> but ‚ÄúFix another Raku-style mistype‚Äù is just clutter :)

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: it's not a dead-end

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> release branch will be merged back to master

[19:47] * AlexDaniel shower &

[19:47] <vrurg> Oops... I forgot about the merge back.

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> ta-daa, every commit will exist only once :)

[20:06] <vrurg> This one I like better.

[20:45] <AlexDaniel> btw I really enjoyed this thing at the time: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
