[06:13] <Kaiepi> i'm not sure how i can handle exposing nqp's type parameterization ops through Metamodel::Primitives methods in a way that doesn't make them dependent on which HOW the type given is using

[06:15] <Kaiepi> Metamodel::ParametricRoleGroupHOW always makes the last parameter either a hash of named parameters or a NO_NAMEDS type, but none of the other HOWs in rakudo do anything like this

[06:16] <Kaiepi> the best i can think of is giving the methods that return any of a type's parameters something like a :named parameter, but then people would need to know whether or not the type can actually take named parameters, which idt people will always know to document

[13:16] <lizmat> hmmm... am I understanding the lexicality of $_ wrong?

[13:16] <lizmat> m: $_ = 42; if True { say $_ }

[13:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[13:16] <jnthn> I don't think so

[13:16] <jnthn> Well, or maybe you're understanding it wrong if you find that surprising ;)

[13:17] <lizmat> I guess I am

[13:17] <jnthn> `if` doesn't topicalize

[13:17] <jnthn> Unlike `with`

[13:17] <jnthn> So maybe that's the confusion.

[13:17] <lizmat> but we agree on that $_ is lexical, right ?

[13:17] <jnthn> Yes, no disagreement there :) I'm not sure how what you wrote would disprove that :)

[13:18] <lizmat> I guess I'm confused because I know that each scope has its own slot for $_ ?

[13:18] <jnthn> I mean, the $_ assignment you make is lexically outside of the place you say $_, so if anything that illustrates its lexicality

[13:18] <lizmat> *apper to know

[13:18] <jnthn> It does, but it defaults to OUTER::<$_>

[13:19] <jnthn> Run perl6 --target=ast -e '$_ = 42; if True { say $_ }' and look for getlexouter

[13:20] <lizmat> ok, thanks for the clarification

[13:21] <lizmat> trying to write up the difference in handling of $_ between Perl and Raku

[13:22] <lizmat> m: sub a { say $_ }; $_ = 42; a    # 42 in Perl

[13:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «(Any)␤»

[13:24] <jnthn> Right, 'cus a routine gets a fresh $_ with no defaulting to the outer one; that's a property of blocks rather than routines.

[13:26] <lizmat> hmmm.. but if that's the property of blocks, why does this say 42?

[13:26] <lizmat> m: $_ = 42; { say $_ }

[13:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[13:27] <jnthn> 'cus the {...} there is a block? :)

[13:29] *** Altai-man_ joined
[13:30] <lizmat> "that's a property of blocks rather than routines"  ??

[13:31] <lizmat> sorry to be persistent, but I want to truly grok this for fear of spreading misinformation otherwise  :-)

[13:32] *** sena_kun left
[13:38] <lucasb> iiuc, the property in question is: $_ defaulting to OUTER::<$_> in blocks

[13:49] <lucasb> m: my &f = { .say }; $_ = 42; for ^3 { .say; f }

[13:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «0␤42␤1␤42␤2␤42␤»

[13:50] <lucasb> is this right? &f sees 42, not the values from the range

[13:55] <lucasb> m: my &f = { .say }; $_ = 42; { .say; f }  # for comparison :)

[13:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «42␤42␤»

[13:55] <lizmat> lucasb: yeah, I think that's correct

[13:56] <jnthn> Yes, that illustrates the lexicality nicely, even.

[13:56] <jnthn> And yes, the property I was referring to is defaulting to OUTER::<$_>

[13:57] <lizmat> m: my &f = -> $_? { .say }; $_ = 42; for ^3 { .say; f }   

[13:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «0␤(Mu)␤1␤(Mu)␤2␤(Mu)␤»

[13:58] <lizmat> shouldn't that be (Any) ?

[13:59] <lizmat> jnthn: still, there is something funky going on:

[13:59] <lizmat> m: my &f = -> ;; $_? is raw { .say }; $_ = 42; f

[13:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[14:00] <lizmat> m: my &f = { .say }; $_ = 42; f

[14:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[14:00] <lizmat> introspection shows that signature of both cases is identical

[14:00] <lizmat> m: my &f = { .say }; dd &f.signature

[14:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «:(;; $_? is raw)␤»

[14:00] <lizmat> m: my &f = -> ;; $_? is raw { .say }; dd &f.signature

[14:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «:(;; $_? is raw)␤»

[14:00] <lizmat> so there's something else that makes the tow cases different

[14:01] <lizmat> *two

[14:02] <jnthn> I think somehting is off with signature dumping

[14:02] <jnthn> There's a special flag for "obtain the value from the outer"

[14:02] <jnthn> And probably .perl on the signature doesn't account for it

[14:03] <lizmat> ok, then I will look at that

[14:04] <lizmat> jnthn: do we actually have syntax for that flag ?

[14:07] <jnthn> = OUTER::<$the-variable-name>

[14:07] <jnthn> But I think actually we only ever code-gen it for the $_ case

[14:08] <jnthn> (And it's there so we can easily spit out better code)

[14:08] <lizmat> ok, so the signature in that case should be:

[14:08] <lizmat> -> ;; $_ = OUTER:<$_> is raw

[14:09] <lizmat> am about to go on the road for Amsterdam PM meeting, will look at this later today / tomorrow

[14:11] <El_Che> jnthn: new comma, new cro, new rakudo soon: wow

[14:21] <jnthn> lizmat: Looks right to me

[14:26] <jnthn> El_Che: Yes, nice to have things happening :)

[15:38] <moritz> sorry, wrong window

[15:38] <moritz> and for the curious: tabnine is a machine learning autocompletion engine that can be plugged into several editors and IDEs

[15:39] <moritz> it's pretty great, except that occasionally, it gobbles up all RAM and CPU :(

[15:46] <lizmat> m: $_ = 66; my &f := -> $_ = OUTER::<$_> { .say }; f

[15:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «66␤»

[15:47] <lizmat> looks like the syntax -> $_ = OUTER:<$_> won't cut it, roundtrippable wise  jnthn

[15:48] <lizmat> but I guess .perl on Parameters is mostly FYI anyway, rather than to roundtrip

[15:49] <jnthn> Yeah...though I think we have an issue somewhere noting that default thunks are not marked as thunks and so aren't skipped properly
