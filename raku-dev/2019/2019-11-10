[11:25] <tbrowder> has there been a moarvm release yet?

[11:40] *** chloekek joined
[11:42] <chloekek> I'm experiencing weird behavior from install-dist.p6. When I look at the source code of Rakudo I see this $perl_wrapper: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/40b13322c503808235d9fec782d3767eb8edb899/src/core/CompUnit/Repository/Installation.pm6#L53-L56

[11:43] <chloekek> But when I run install-dist.p6 to install a distribution (both install-dist.p6 and Rakudo are version 2019.07.1), I get a wrapper that looks like this: https://gist.github.com/chloekek/710fcb48a0a7cfd1febcff122b251e67

[11:44] <chloekek> This looks similar to the source code of the CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.run-script method, but it's not entirely the same (uses exit run instead of require). Yet I can't find "exit run" mentioned anywhere in the source code of Rakudo 2019.07.1.

[11:45] <chloekek> Where does the wrapper template come from and why is it not the same as $perl_wrapper?

[12:15] <Altai-man_> tbrowder, nope, the latest is 07

[12:15] <Altai-man_> *07.1 to be precise

[12:48] <tbrowder> thnx

[12:50] <tbrowder> and we're waiting for a new moarvm release to release rakudo, correct?

[12:51] <Altai-man_> yes

[18:59] <tyil> lizmat: not for twitter

[18:59] <tyil> I have 2 other sources I'm scraping

[18:59] <lizmat> ok

[18:59] <lizmat> well... I have updated ~ 50 modules today sofar, and have not seen any mention of this on channel

[22:50] <lizmat> hmmm... do we need capturing parens for a named capture or not?

[22:50] <lizmat> m: "þor is mighty good" ~~ /is \s+ $<iswhat>=(\w+) \s+ good/; say $<iswhat>; say $0

[22:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0b8ede6c4: OUTPUT: «｢mighty｣␤Nil␤»

[22:50] <lizmat> m: "þor is mighty good" ~~ /is \s+ $<iswhat>=\w+ \s+ good/; say $<iswhat>; say $0

[22:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0b8ede6c4: OUTPUT: «｢mighty｣␤Nil␤»

[22:51] <lizmat> looks like it is not needed ?

[22:51] <lizmat> I guess it does if you want to match across whitespace ?

[22:51] <lizmat> m: "þor is mighty good" ~~ /is \s+ $<iswhat>=(\w+ \s+ good)/; say $<iswhat>; say $0

[22:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0b8ede6c4: OUTPUT: «｢mighty good｣␤Nil␤»

[22:52] *** tobs joined
[22:53] <jnthn> Yes, but you could also use $<foo>=[...]

[22:57] <lizmat> m: "þor is mighty good" ~~ /is \s+ $<iswhat>=[\w+ \s+ good]/; say $<iswhat>; say $0

[22:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0b8ede6c4: OUTPUT: «｢mighty good｣␤Nil␤»

[22:58] <lizmat> so why does the ( ) version not also populate $0 ?

[22:59] <lizmat> feels a bit meh

[22:59] <lizmat> anyways...

[22:59] <jnthn> 'cus capturiung the same thing under two names would probably be an accident most of the time, I guess

[23:00] <lizmat> m: "þor is mighty good" ~~ /is \s+ $<iswhat>=(\w+) \s+ (good)/; say $<iswhat>; say $0

[23:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0b8ede6c4: OUTPUT: «｢mighty｣␤｢good｣␤»

[23:01] <lizmat> reading that regex, you might think that "good" would be stored in $1

[23:02] <lizmat> anyways, it just caught my attention  :-)
