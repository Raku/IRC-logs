[12:58] <tbrowder> hi, i am starting to use declarator blocks in my code so p6doc can show the comments, but at the moment such comments are extracted and normalized, which is very ugly.

[13:00] <tbrowder> there is an issue to allow some formatting but it actually seems to be an easy fix to just eliminate the call to normalize_text so the author's formatting remains.

[13:02] <tbrowder> i will try that today and, if it works as i hope it will, i will submit the PR if no one objects.
