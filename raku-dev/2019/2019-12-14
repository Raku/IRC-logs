[00:01] <japhb> lizmat: I meant "compile-time" for the *key*, not for the *lookup*.  Meaning that a compile-time constant key should be compilable to the most statically optimal way to call AT-KEY, and then run-time spesh should handle optimizing the late-bound lookup itself.

[00:55] <patrickb> .tell rba: Can you remove the forward /files/rakudo -> github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases on the production rakudo.org as well? I think there is little potential for breakage, and that would help me to prepare a small migration script for the files.

[00:55] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to rba

[00:55] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Do you agree that this has little potential for breaking anything? ^

[00:55] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel

[00:56] <patrickb> If I remember correctly that forward was simply a quick fix for when the webserver died and we didn't manage to recover the files timely.
