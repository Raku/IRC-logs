[12:52] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it won't be a “Rakudo Perl 6” release for sure, it'll be just a “Rakudo” release

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> and more changes will be done, I think. “Rakudo is an implementation of Raku on the Moar Virtual Machine”

[12:53] <lizmat> ack, ok

[12:54] <AlexDaniel> so yes, I think it'll be a Raku release, I don't see an easy way for it to be not

[19:27] <patrickb> Are gdb / valgrind / lldb disturbed by the process to be debugged exec-ing?

[19:35] <patrickb> If yes, we could either change the gdb / valgrind / lldb runners to call the perl6-m native executable in the build directory or just remove them entirely.

[19:43] <vrurg> patrickb: what do you mean by 'disturbed'?

[19:43] <patrickb> not being usable.

[19:44] <vrurg> patrickb: might be my English, but I don't get you. :)

[19:45] <patrickb> the perl6-m executable in the build dir just execs moar with the correct parameters. The original reason the debugger wrapper scripts were added was because one couldn't debug a shell script. Now I replaced the shell script with a native executable. If those tools are working on that executable there is not much reason to keep them.

[19:45] *** ufobat left
[19:46] <patrickb> The only reason I can see why those tools might have a problem is because of the exec() that executable uses to call moar.

[19:49] <vrurg> I see. Perhaps it didn't make sense to make them executables? Just have shortcuts for quick-start debug?

[19:53] *** ufobat_ is now known as ufobat

[19:53] <patrickb> If `perl6-valgrind-m`ends up being a shortcut for `valgrind perl6-m` we can just remove it. It doesn't even save a single letter to type.

[19:58] <vrurg> patrickb: I'll afk for a while. Will try to have another look at it later today if don't forget.

[19:58] <nine> I think rr is not too happy about that exec()

[20:02] <patrickb> nine: There is no rr wrapper atm though.

[20:03] <nine> That's the irony :)

[20:20] <sortiz> nine: If time permits, can you take a look to rakudo issue #3235 ?

[20:22] <nine> sortiz: already am

[20:28] <sortiz> Thank you

[20:41] <MasterDuke> would this be relevant for rakudo (or moarvm)? https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-10-scheduler/

[20:43] <nine> Cloning may be an issue
