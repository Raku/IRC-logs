[01:19] <vrurg_> AlexDaniel: what?? Again?? :)

[01:22] <sena_kun> 400+ modules to test left, going to sleep...

[01:36] <AlexDaniel> vrurg_: well, we didn't get to any conclusion

[01:37] <vrurg_> AlexDaniel: I could be wrong, but I thought it is postponed for past 6.e release.

[01:38] <vrurg_> We have too many things to take care of with regard to the renaming itself. Fighting the version schema changes on top of it? Not sure...

[01:39] <AlexDaniel> it's not really on top of it, it's just another thing that needs doing

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> as always, we can of course reject the ticket and then we will start over in a few months

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> I'm fine with postponing it for after 6.e

[01:43] <vrurg_> AlexDaniel: Let's work out a decision in this thread, I'm definitely up for it. Then we can implement the decision with the next lang release.

[12:51] <Altai-man> releasable6, status

[12:51] <releasable6> Altai-man, Next release in â‰ˆ6 hours. There are no known blockers. 0 out of 288 commits logged

[12:51] <releasable6> Altai-man, Details: https://gist.github.com/0c671760f3ffd77ed876c7afc4422951

[12:51] *** Altai-man is now known as sena_kun

[12:58] <AlexDaniel`> pong

[12:58] <AlexDaniel`> I'm a bit busy right now

[12:58] <AlexDaniel`> sena_kun: grep for `Bisected:` in the overview file

[12:59] <AlexDaniel`> it does generate separate files with output for bisected modules too

[12:59] <AlexDaniel`> so that should be visible too

[12:59] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, no "Fail" ones, no "Bisected" ones too.

[12:59] <sena_kun> I am grepping data.json

[12:59] <AlexDaniel`> sena_kun: not sure about data.json, look at the overview

[13:00] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, nothing in overview too.

[13:00] <AlexDaniel`> also if you can gist that overview file that'd be nice

[13:00] <AlexDaniel`> then we'll be able to compare it to previous results to see if it actually tested anything at all

[13:01] <sena_kun> https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/8bdf736a278cefcaa7d3bb1420830e8e

[13:01] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, we are not in a great hurry, I guess, I need to update changelog before anyway

[13:02] <AlexDaniel`> 525 ZefFailure

[13:02] <AlexDaniel`> that's not right

[13:02] <sena_kun> :S

[13:03] <AlexDaniel`> it doesn't mean there's something wrong with zef, just that the installation failed in a weird way

[13:03] <AlexDaniel`> so yeah, we'll need to rerun it properly

[13:04] <sena_kun> I see a lot of e.g. "The following candidates are already installed: Desktop::Notify\nÂ«timed out after 600 secondsÂ»" kind of output records.

[13:04] <sena_kun> "The following candidates are already installed: Email::Valid\nÂ«timed out after 600 secondsÂ»"

[13:04] <AlexDaniel`> so, how slow was the machine and how many threads did you use?

[13:04] <AlexDaniel`> maybe a lot of modules simply timed out

[13:05] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, the one rba++ prepared, 24 threads

[13:05] <sena_kun> no thread degree set for blin, simply `time podman run -ti -v /var/tmp/Blin-volume:/mnt rakudo/blin`

[13:05] <AlexDaniel`> right

[13:05] <AlexDaniel`> I guess that was too much

[13:06] <AlexDaniel`> it's a good start though

[13:06] <AlexDaniel`> maybe try with 12 instead, and with twice as much patience :)

[13:07] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, oki...

[13:07] <AlexDaniel`> ok, afk

[13:07] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel`, nproc = 12?

[13:09] <sena_kun> "Will use up to 12 threads for testing modules" <- ok, now waiting...

[14:07] <patrickb> o/

[14:07] <tellable6> 2019-12-20T15:46:58Z #raku <tadzik> patrickb the rename may be worth it if you're doing the whole rewrite, re-setup, re-marketing etc for the sake of reducing confusion

[14:07] <tellable6> 2019-12-20T15:48:20Z #raku <tadzik> patrickb kind of like plenv has a different name to perlbrew: they are different projects, incompatible, even though they achieve pretty much the same thing :)

[14:07] <tellable6> hey patrickb, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/826d08ea90c15deeb8b81e2e062d2069

[14:10] <patrickb> My try to build rakudo-2019.11 on Windows gives reliable test failures in ./08-performance/99-misc.t, 04-nativecall/11-cpp.t and 04-nativecall/13-cpp-mangling.t. I this known?

[14:10] <patrickb> Master on CI doees not fail these tests...

[14:10] <patrickb> I tried on two completely different machines, one with a completely fresh Windows 10.

[14:11] <patrickb> Given this is not the fault of the build, but of rakudo, would such a compile be ok to use the creation of precompiled release packages?

[14:12] <patrickb> .tell tadzik Thanks for the reply and heads up!

[14:12] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tadzik

[14:12] <patrickb> .tell tadzik I'll go forward in that direction then.

[14:12] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tadzik

[14:13] <patrickb> I'm rather sick, so off to bed for me again. o/
