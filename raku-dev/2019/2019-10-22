[12:15] <tbrowder> some help, please: i need to write a test for the presence or absence of a particular environment variable. i see tests where env vars are deleted before a test, but none where an env var is set, inside a test script, before a test. so far my attempts have failed, but i am trying to set an envar with a BEGIN block and nqp code.

[12:19] <tbrowder> hm, do i need to wrap a script string with EVAL?

[12:22] <nine> tbrowder: what variable is that?

[12:25] <tbrowder> i'm trying to modify %*ENV to add my new var RAKUDO_POD_DECL_USER_FORMAT in a test script. i can define it in the current shell process before the test and it works. but i can't modify presence or absence during the test.

[12:26] <tbrowder> i'm not sure it can be done, but it would be handy.

[12:26] <discord6> <noelsken> t/09-moar/00-misc.t does something like that it seems

[12:26] <tbrowder> yes, it deletes env vars

[12:26] <discord6> <noelsken> (temp %*ENV)<MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING  MVM_SPESH_NODELAY> = 1, 1;looks like setting env vars to me

[12:27] <discord6> <noelsken> but maybe I'm misreading it :s

[12:27] <tbrowder> sorry, i'm thinking of the telemetry tests

[12:28] <tbrowder> i'll look at that--didn't think to look at moar

[12:28] <tbrowder> thnx

[12:29] <discord6> <noelsken> it's a rakudo test

[12:31] <nine> tbrowder: the effectiveness may simply depend on where in rakudo that environment variable is read. If it's too early in the compilation process, changing it within the script may just not have any effect. In that case you'd have to set the variable in the script and start a new process that does the actual test

[12:33] <tbrowder>  discord6: that looks like the solution, thanks!

[12:34] <tbrowder> nine: i think that's what the moar test is doing with helper is-run

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/master

[16:37] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: it's tests failing. Would it be related to the commit then build would fail because the only change there is about dependencies in receipes.

[16:38] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: it's not tests. NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make

[16:39] <vrurg> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rakudo/rakudo/builds/28274452/job/fliywj4f8tva85yc ??

[16:39] <vrurg> Basically, any in https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rakudo/rakudo/builds/28274452

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> yes

[16:43] <vrurg> Ah, damn, lost it in all the other noise.

[16:47] <vrurg> What nmake do they use??? Why it works on my win7??

[17:08] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: do you know if it's possible to pull a file from job?

[17:09] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I don't even know how to restart these jobs :(

[17:10] <vrurg> Ah, you don't have that permission too.

[17:11] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: there's a thing called artifacts, I think it can be configured to upload files of interest

[17:11] <AlexDaniel> for all jobs

[17:11] <vrurg> I currently have no slightest idea what's wrong about them. It seems like a prerequisite list is quoted in the Makefile ('" used in nmake error message suggests this). But I nowhere use quoting for these. 

[17:13] <vrurg> Oh, wait, I do... I forgot to switch branches in my local clone. :(
