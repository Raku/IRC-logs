[10:00] <releasable6> jmerelo, Details: https://gist.github.com/e36a8f16887e2f039c8560041dfcce9e

[10:01] <jmerelo> Great!

[10:01] <jmerelo> Anyway, updated https://docs.raku.org are ready

[10:06] <lizmat> jmerelo: do you have any idea how to get rid of the "Perl6 Documentation" header, and the link "Perl 6 homepage" ?

[10:06] <lizmat> I haven't been able to find where those are generated (I believe)

[10:07] <jmerelo> lizmat: part of the config

[10:07] <lizmat> where does that live ?

[10:07] <jmerelo> https://rakudocs.github.io/ fixes that

[10:07] <jmerelo> I'll fix it too

[10:07] <lizmat> rakudocs.github.io doesn't fix the homepage link  :-(

[10:08] <jmerelo> lizmat: right, I just realized that

[10:08] <lizmat> "Perl 6 compiler developers... "

[10:08] <jmerelo> Please raise an issue with all that and I'll try to adress it ASAP

[10:09] <jmerelo> lizmat: Generated pages are tricky... 

[10:09] <lizmat> ok, will do

[10:34] *** ExtraCrispy joined
[10:39] <jmerelo> lizmat: thanks

[10:58] <jmerelo> lizmat: that was the version in the cache. It's changed now

[10:59] <jmerelo> lizmat: still says "Perl6 documentation, though"

[11:01] <[Tux]> Rakudo version 2019.07.1-478-g75056dfa1 - MoarVM version 2019.07.1-317-g1b2f72e5e

[11:01] <lizmat> 10.1 ?  looks like an outlier ?

[11:01] <[Tux]> That does not look good. I'll run it again. Maybe sopmething else was eating resources

[11:02] <lizmat> yeah... indeed...

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> [Tux]: who is [TuxCM] on #perl6-dev ?

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> :)

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> if it's you, can you reconfigure your client to join #raku-dev instead?

[11:14] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: that's also Tux, at $work I think

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> [Tux]: same for #perl6 (don't join) and #raku (join!)

[11:18] *** epony left
[11:35] <jmerelo> With the new documentable, changing boilerplate is still not terribly easy. Some parts of generated pages are hard-coded, some are in a configuration file, some are templates

[11:37] <jmerelo> At least, it now takes somewhat north of 5 minutes to generate it, instead of the former 20 minutes

[11:37] <jmerelo> Here's the new version https://docs-stage.raku.org/, which is (almost completely) Perl-6-less 

[11:43] <jmerelo> I guess it's better to copy it to the docs.raku.org site too.

[11:44] <jmerelo> OK, done: https://docs.raku.org/

[11:44] <jmerelo> Please tell me or, better, raise an issue if you find anything wrong...

[11:44] <lizmat> jmerelo++  :-)

[11:46] <jmerelo> Please remember to link to this new documentation domain everywhere, specially StackOverflow 

[11:47] <lizmat> :)  yes!

[11:47] <jmerelo> Searches for "raku whatever" return either pottery stuff, or uzluisf Raku by Example (which is good, but not what we are looking for), or the (provisional) rakudocs.github.io in the best of cases

[11:48] <jmerelo> I might generate some special footer for that one, saying it's just a provisional site and link docs.raku.org

[11:48] <jmerelo> (asking uzluisf might be a good idea too)

[11:58] <jmerelo> OK, that's taken care of via a merge request https://gitlab.com/uzluisf/raku-by-example/merge_requests/1

[19:33] <nine> I wonder why we go through all the trouble to keep the design documents unchanged? They are out of date in a lot of places but that's just because no one bothers updating them. But that doesn't mean that no one should be allowed to update them.

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> what do you mean?

[19:37] <vrurg> nine: Maybe because they doesn't define language but have historical value?

[19:39] <AlexDaniel> what ‚Äútrouble‚Äù exactly and who is trying to keep them unchanged? Am I missing something?

[19:40] <lizmat> vrurg was opposed to my change to the specs

[19:41] <lizmat> to be clear: I want people interested in the design considerations of Raku to not get entangled in what basically can be a confusing set of documents

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> personally I don't care, but I am worried a bit that someone may find ‚ÄúRaku design documents‚Äù and get an impression that it's something up-to-date

[19:42] <lizmat> for instance, S01 states: "We are not turning Perl into any other existing language."

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> ha

[19:43] <discord6> <Rogue> Right now the real spec is roast

[19:43] <discord6> <Rogue> But obviously that's not too navigable

[19:43] <vrurg> Maybe a preface explaining these obscurities?

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> Rogue: yet :)

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> I'm optimistic :)

[19:44] <vrurg> Otherwise the papers are outdated not just in respect to the language name but to the language design itself in some aspects. 

[19:45] <discord6> <Rogue> I don't know if it's worthwhile to "update" historical documents rather than make a new set of documents that will be kept up-to-date

[19:45] <vrurg> For this reason I wouldn't recommend anybody to base his decisions on them.

[19:45] <vrurg> Rogue++

[19:47] <discord6> <Rogue> not that it's an easy task, considering the sheer amount of information that would need to be meticulously crafted into English
