[00:00] <vrurg> That's why I need more info from find_method_qualified. Currently I can only get the type by double-conretizing which to too slow.

[00:00] <jnthn> I...don't think this should interact with callsame?

[00:01] <jnthn> That feels really wrong, design wise.

[00:01] <jnthn> But maybe that isn't what you meant.

[00:01] <jnthn> That `self.Foo::R::info` isn't an error also seems wrong

[00:02] <vrurg> jnthn: Perhaps it requires a problem-solving. It's hard to fit all details into IRC format.

[00:02] <jnthn> Yes, indeed.

[00:03] <jnthn> To me, it looks like the question is of how we interpret something like `self.R::inc-a`, in so far as one has an expectation that it's not so virtual as we're treating it

[00:04] <jnthn> Or at least, if it is that virtual, it's fragile if we're subclassed or similar (guess this extends to roles resolving things from the roles they do also)
