[15:06] <AlexDaniel> samcv: btw I think I realized what feels wrong about samemark. With samecase you can pick which characters should be changed and which ones should be left as is (e.g. ‘__A__a_’). But with samemark you're always affecting all of the characters

[15:06] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to samcv

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> samcv: so you can say ‘uppercase the 4th character’ but you can't say ‘add a ö mark to the 4th character’

[15:07] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to samcv

[15:08] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: how in the world do you approve a PR?

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> samcv: so this throws the consistency between the two out of the window, and .samemark ends up being good only for removing all marks (dezalgo, but why?) or adding the same mark to everything like a striketrough or similar

[15:09] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to samcv

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: hmmm

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: you mean in problem-solving? There's no button for you?

[15:10] <MasterDuke> i don't see one

[15:10] <MasterDuke> i think i once requested a self-review or something like that and then i had a button

[15:10] <MasterDuke> but that seems unnecessarily complicated

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> github UI is awful :(

[15:14] <MasterDuke> ok, got the notification and had a button and used it

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: yeah, I should request reviews from everyone by writing their names in the damn box

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> and I have to do this one by one, and it doesn't tell if someone has already left a review

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> I think I accidentally dismissed someone's review :(

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> I guess I'll end up making a bot for it, eventually

[15:15] <MasterDuke> in general i don't mind github's ui, but reviewing is annoying

[15:15] <vrurg> MasterDuke: if you go to 'files changed' section then in 'review changes' you'll see approve button.

[15:16] <MasterDuke> vrurg: ah. i'll give that a try on the next one

[15:16] <MasterDuke> vrurg++ that worked

[15:20] <AlexDaniel> github's UI is simple and relatively easy to understand, which is nice, but honestly their whole website is a mess

[15:21] <AlexDaniel> whenever you start doing something outside the box you immediately notice issues

[15:22] *** redable joined
[15:23] <AlexDaniel> for example: https://imgur.com/a/l44FkUp

[15:23] <AlexDaniel> so the options go from 1 to 6, and I managed to choose 13 because we needed more

[15:24] <AlexDaniel> how? By modifying the web request

[15:24] <AlexDaniel> IIRC they allow up to 99 and after that they'll reject it on the server side

[15:51] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: what makes you think you can't say "add a ?? mark to the 5th character"?

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: I can? how?

[15:52] <timotimo> m: say samemark("hello world", "aaa??")

[15:52] <timotimo> what did i just do

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: that will remove marks from the first few characters

[15:52] <timotimo> ooh is that what

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> m: say samemark("hõllo world", "aaaaäa")

[15:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b2a45ff6: OUTPUT: «This type (List) does not support positional operations␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b2a45ff6: OUTPUT: «hi␤»

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> what is going on lol

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> c: HEAD~30 say "hõllo world".samemark("aaaaäa")

[15:56] <timotimo> wtf :)

[23:51] <japhb> Something seems unstable with current rakudo HEAD.  I've tried installing the same version, with the same modules, several times in a row, and it fails it different ways with different modules each time.  Test failures, modules that can't be found in the repo list, segfaults in zef, etc.  I install a fairly long and varied list of modules, so I do end up tripping over bugs often, but this seems to be some 

[23:51] <japhb> form of random memory corruption or so.
