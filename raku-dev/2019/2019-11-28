[19:41] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: this doesn't make any sense

[19:41] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: how could it possibly affect performance

[19:42] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/44c459e804c8a2d0231b56eb669243cf

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> but it does

[19:44] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: boomer...

[19:44] <vrurg> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7aa2848fa903f7c5c10ca0adf20d6c120cc6b8d2 is the bisected one, right?

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> no no (2019-08-06) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ae4ba74262b1155ddf57cd2bac1f3aaccfc1e47f

[19:46] <vrurg> Not a little bit better... The real one could be +/-2 commits away from the bisect result. 

[19:46] <vrurg> Actually, what I would like to do is to run it through all compilable commits and build a graph.

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> we can do that

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> it won't help you, though

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> because that's exactly the commit where performance changed

[19:48] <vrurg> But doing so on my laptop makes little sense because macbook's active throttling makes benchmarking almost useless. Have to run in on one of my VM servers on a remote location.

[19:48] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: what makes you so assured?

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: give me like a range of 50 commits and we'll do it real quick

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: this: https://gist.github.com/44c459e804c8a2d0231b56eb669243cf

[19:49] <AlexDaniel> even with the noise it's very consistent

[19:50] <AlexDaniel> shareable6: ae4ba74262b^

[19:50] <shareable6> AlexDaniel, https://whateverable.6lang.org/ae4ba74262b^

[19:50] <AlexDaniel> shareable6: ae4ba74262b

[19:50] <shareable6> AlexDaniel, https://whateverable.6lang.org/ae4ba74262b

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> ok I just confirmed that gcc version didn't change for these builds

[19:52] <vrurg> Most convincing would be to see -10/+10 commits around it.

[19:53] <vrurg> Or even -20/+20 to have 40 commits covered. 

[19:54] <vrurg> Then it could be tested on the master with and without 5 lines starting from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ae4ba74262b1155ddf57cd2bac1f3aaccfc1e47f#diff-934b2f4bf4300d4256d450c3372330fcR686 

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: give me the start sha and end sha

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> and we'll plot it

[19:56] <vrurg> Starting one: ecf2b1e4fa9605737cb6b657fb6b7bdd879fc4f8 

[19:56] <vrurg> Not that simple to move forward...

[19:57] <vrurg> And lets finish with 7e1062659fb638abfe2af1563c5b59c953f18bc5

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> c: ecf2b1e4fa..7e1062659f say 42

[20:09] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: ↑

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> so 7aa2848fa90 is kinda weird too

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> it's not linear, there was a merge, so it can look confusing

[20:12] <vrurg> boomer, boomer, boomer... Does it mean that 6.c is that slow?

[20:13] <vrurg> 7aa2848fa90 could be a fluctuation.

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> pretty sure it's not

[20:14] <AlexDaniel> c: 7aa2848,7aa2848,7aa2848,7aa2848 https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/00198fac369062afb76cc35a435f70ef

[20:14] <AlexDaniel> ok it is

[20:15] <vrurg> Since it's a merge, I would also test around 74f2d3f46 which the other side.

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> it already did, I think

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> also ae4ba74262b is not a merge

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also you probably mean “bummer”, boomer is somebody else :D

[20:18] <vrurg> Aha, sounds similar... thanks...

[20:19] <vrurg> But it's a weird thing anyway. It turns out that performance depends on compiler version. And, basically, in this case it means 6.d beats 6.c.

[20:20] *** jmerelo left
[20:20] <nine> Which is not surprising at all

[20:25] <vrurg> nine: Well, not to me. I don't see anything related to optimizations which would depend on language revision in the core.

[20:27] <nine> vrurg: decontrv vs. decontrv_v6c for example
