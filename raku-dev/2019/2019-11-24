[09:02] *** jmerelo joined
[09:03] <jmerelo> The "old" perl6 documentation pages now include a notice and link to the new ones https://docs.perl6.org/ (I guess it'll take a while to propagate to the CDN)

[09:03] <jmerelo> They also say "Raku documentation" in the main page. Since that's hard-coded into Documentable, I kind of couldn't help it. Can change it by hand if needed, though.

[09:03] <jmerelo> Will do it, indeed.

[09:06] <jmerelo> Ah, OK, now it works. 

[09:07] <jmerelo> Just a reminder: for some time, docs.perl6.org will be the "old" pages (frozen sometime in October) with a link to equivalent page in the new documents, which are hosted in https://docs.raku.org

[09:08] <jmerelo> Also, now some search like "raku twigils" return the document pages in the 4th position https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=raku+twigils&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

[09:08] <jmerelo> I have been editing some stackoverflow answers to the new URLs; please purposefully add links to the new documentation there (and elsewhere) and try to avoid links to the old one.

[09:09] <jmerelo> This will stay that way for some time, until search engines pick everything up correctly; then we will redirect old pages to new ones.

[09:11] <rba> jmerelo++

[09:11] <jmerelo> Please also note that the "old" docs worked with "doc" and "docs" indistinctly, with "doc" being the preferred spelling. Now only "docs.raku.org" is available

[09:12] <jmerelo> rba: BTW, docs.raku.org points to the "old" Altai-man server. I have updated it already in the new docs.perl6.org.

[09:13] <jmerelo> rba: I seem to remember you asked me to stop using that interim server that was set up; I think we can start using the new one from now on.

[09:13] <jmerelo> rba: sorry, I meant docs.perl6.org above.

[09:20] <rba> I see. docs.perl6.org -> interim server, docs.raku.org -> hosting server

[09:21] <rba> jmerelo: In case you like to move docs.perl6.org to the hosting server as well, let me know. I have to make sure let's encrpyt is creating new certificates asap.

[09:21] <jmerelo> rba: yes, please. Content has already been copied there.

[09:22] <jmerelo> rba: I mean, when you can.

[09:22] <rba> jmerelo: Sure :-) ready in front or my notebook...

[09:22] <jmerelo> rba++

[09:23] <rba> jmerelo: Q: Do we like to redirect doc.perl6.org -> docs.perl6.org? Or just server under both names?

[09:25] <jmerelo> rba: There are a gazillion links to doc.perl6.org. I don't think there's a difference, SEO-wise. Probably redirect will save you generate a new certificate, right?

[09:26] <rba> jmerelo: This is not a question of the certificate, more a tatical one. I propose to do a redirect. And in the meantime I will add doc.raku.org -> docs.raku.org as well. Seems to be forgotten last time...

[09:26] <jmerelo> rba: OK. About doc.raku.org... Maybe we shouldn't

[09:27] <rba> jmerelo: Ok...

[09:27] <jmerelo> rba: it's generated enough confusion. Also, we don't want to split links in two domains for the time being. Let's just use a single one, and that will be docs.raku.org

[09:27] *** ExtraCrispy joined
[09:28] <rba> jmerelo: So I will NOT add any doc.raku.org. So DNS is telling anybody this hostname does'nt exists. Ok too.

[09:28] <jmerelo> rba: right. Thanks!

[09:30] *** ExtraCrispy left
[09:44] <rba> Ok. Did the switches and invalidate CMS cache for perl6.org. 

[09:44] <rba> jmerelo: May you please double-check from your side?

[09:51] <jmerelo> rba: OK

[09:52] <jmerelo> docs.perl6.org looks fine

[09:52] <jmerelo> doc.perl6.org too.

[09:52] <rba> Hmm. Something went wrong. https://docs.perl6.org/type/Any is not showing content any more.

[09:52] <jmerelo> rba: that's the nginx hack

[09:53] <jmerelo> rba: we've got to add this to the configuration https://github.com/perl6/doc#nginx-configuration

[09:53] <jmerelo> I can do it if you want.

[09:53] <rba> jmerelo: fixed

[09:53] <jmerelo> rba++

[09:53] <jmerelo> rba: we should really have a way to do all this automatically.

[09:54] <rba> jmerelo: Question for me would be if you like to more prominent put the deprecation message with the link to docs.raku.org on top of each page?

[09:55] <rba> jmerelo: Yes. I we started already working on this.

[09:55] <jmerelo> rba: they're not so much intended for human consumption as for search engine spiders...

[09:55] <rba> My plan is to have every website run in it's own docker container.

[09:55] <jmerelo> rba: tht would be great :-)

[09:55] <rba> With a traeffik in front.

[09:56] <rba> This would allow us to setup all the sited redundant as well.

[09:56] <jmerelo> rba: nginx would be inside the container then?

[09:56] <rba> Hopefully the Cloudflare DNS then doing what I expect and just route it to the next backend server.

[09:57] <rba> jmerelo: Nginx using http or the site which are using Mojolicious would be doing the serving of the page.

[09:57] <jmerelo> rba: not mojolicious, please

[09:57] <rba> jmerelo: traeffik will do https->http.

[09:57] <rba> jmerelo: Mojo is still part of some pages...

[09:57] <rba> rakudo.org

[09:58] <jmerelo> jmerelo: I don't really know what it's doing. 

[09:58] <rba> marketing.raku.org

[09:58] <jmerelo> But One can only shave yaks so far. It's no longer needed in docs, at least.

[09:58] <rba> and modules.raku.org

[09:59] *** sena_kun joined
[09:59] <rba> I think in modules is stil necessary.

[09:59] <nine> Why don't we redirect doc.perl6.org to docs.raku.org right away?

[09:59] <jmerelo> rba: so some containers will serve using Mojo and some of them will use nginx, right?

[09:59] <rba> jmerelo: Yes, this is the idea.

[10:00] *** ExtraCrispy joined
[10:00] <jmerelo> rba: great!

[10:00] <rba> jmerelo: Then using docker-compose try to put it together.

[10:00] <rba> jmerelo: So for I'm still in the trial phase...

[10:01] <rba> jmerelo: I hope I have more time in xmas holidays for this...

[10:01] <jmerelo> nine: it would not be good for visibility either of Perl 6 or of Raku. We've created this roadmap https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/3046

[10:01] <jmerelo> rba: so, not kubernetes for doing automatic scaling and stuff.

[10:02] <rba> jmerelo: I'm interessted in Kubernets. Yet, not sure if this overcomplicated the things.

[10:02] <rba> jmerelo: Open for some guidance from your side...

[10:02] <jmerelo> rba: I guess that as long as you're offloading scaling to the CDN it's OK.

[10:03] *** Altai-man_ joined
[10:03] <jmerelo> rba: totally blushing by this. I'm just an amateur, you're the pro. 

[10:03] <jmerelo> rba: containers are perfect, because we can deploy them anywhere if we so want. Heroku, Amazon...

[10:03] <rba> jmerelo: Not a pro in this area yet...

[10:04] <jmerelo> rba: speaking of which... Any news from Amazon?

[10:04] <nine> jmerelo: "We need the two sets of pages for the new ones to gather SEO juice" that's not correct. Search engines would follow the redirects. One can also accelerate the process for Google by adding the new domain in the search console.

[10:04] <rba> jmerelo: No, just an automated answere that they are reviewing it.

[10:04] <jmerelo> nine: they would, and them slam down the results in search queries because "perl 6" would not be in any place in these new pages.

[10:04] <rba> jmerelo: So far we just defined some base images: https://github.com/rba/docker-raku-infra

[10:05] *** sena_kun left
[10:05] <jmerelo> rba: looking good :-) If I have some time, I'll check them out. Good call, using Alpine.

[10:08] <rba> jmerelo: Don't look to close yet. There are some placeholder Dockerfile.

[10:09] <jmerelo> rba: I just noticed :-) The intention is clear, though :-) You might want to check out ubuntu 18.04, too. It's got very small footprint,  and you get to use good old Ubuntu.

[10:10] <rba> jmerelo: I'm more familiar with Ubuntu. Some people told me it's easiere to produce small images using Alpine. So far I'm still open...

[10:11] <jmerelo> rba: the thing is, from 18.04 Ubuntu made their "ubuntu-minimal" image the default, and it's _really_ small. Eventually, you might want to check both and pick the smaller one.

[10:12] <rba> jmerelo: Ok.

[10:12] <rba> jmerelo: There are still many open question. Eg. if we should allow cron based github pull inside the image or rather let CI do the rebuild of the image.

[10:13] *** ExtraCrispy left
[10:13] <jmerelo> rba: I would definitely go for CI. The thing is, we would need to set up hooks in every repo. Probably not a bad thing, though. 

[10:16] <rba> jmerelo: Thinking as well if I like to give azure pipelines a try: https://blog.urth.org/2019/11/18/my-new-ci-helpers-for-perl/

[10:17] <rba> jmerelo: Are you now beeing able to doing delta builds for docs? Or how did you solve the long build issues?

[10:17] <jmerelo> rba: it's probably easier to set up GitHub Actions. You can even host the images there https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/3046

[10:18] <jmerelo> rba: yes; the new Documentable takes a few minutes to regenerate just the pages needed

[10:18] <rba> jmerelo: Very nice.

[10:19] <jmerelo> rba: a full build takes between 350 and 450 seconds, an update takes IIRC a fifth of that

[10:19] <jmerelo> rba: it's still got some issues, like generating the type graphs every single time... but it's a great improvement over the 15 minutes it took every single time before.

[10:21] <jmerelo> rba: check out my immensely useful Daleksay (like cowsay, but with daleks) container hosted in GitHub https://github.com/JJ/docker-daleksay/packages

[10:22] <jmerelo> rba: I've still got to get the hang of using github actions to create it, but it'll arrive eventually. I use them for other purposes, anyway.

[10:23] <jmerelo> rba: do you have to pay for Azure Pipelines? Or host the stuff in Azure too?

[10:24] <jmerelo> rba: I'm going to create an issue in your repo, if you don't mind, mainly to remind myself to do that

[10:24] <rba> jmerelo: LOL

[10:26] <rba> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/?nav=min

[10:27] <rba> 10 free paralell jobs for open source  projects...

[10:27] <jmerelo> rba: ah, that's cool :-)

[10:31] <rba> jmerelo: Just to understand. The github action is doing the docker build an then the docker registry on github is used to make it available?

[10:32] <jmerelo> rba: right

[10:32] <jmerelo> rba: isn't it sweet?

[10:32] <rba> jmerelo: yes, it is.

[10:33] <jmerelo> rba: so fat I've done it separately, I'd still have to streamline it in a single action. Shouldn't be too difficult, though.

[10:40] <rba> jmerelo: Thanks for the talk. I think I will be mostly afk for the rest of today...

[10:44] <jmerelo> rba: have fun :-)

[10:54] <nine> jmerelo: thanks for enlightening me :)

[16:37] <lucasb> regarding R#3316, I tried search where that P5 extended pattern (?...) was recognized in https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/QRegex/P5Regex/Grammar.nqp , but couldn't find the spot

[16:38] <lucasb> is that the right place to look for the code that implements the rx:P5/.../ regex flavor, right?

[16:40] <lucasb> IOW, Raku's "P5" regex flavor doesn't implement full compatibility with Perl 5's regex (?)

[16:40] <lucasb> ### Perl 5 regex conditional expressions not working. #3316 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3316

[16:43] <lucasb> also, a time to remind of R#2624

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: it'll come back soon, I have a rewrite

[17:33] *** Xliff left
[17:48] <lizmat> lucasb: FWIW, I think the rx:P5 implementation is from Perl 5.8 or thereabouts

[17:48] <lizmat> functionally speaking

[17:58] <lucasb> I may have misunderstood something. Can't say if Raku supports this feature or not

[17:58] <lucasb> m: say <a b c>.map: { so rx:P5/(?(1)a|b)/ }

[17:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc3094191: OUTPUT: «(False True False)␤»

[17:59] <lucasb> there appears to already exists some tests for it in S05-modifier/perl5*.t files
