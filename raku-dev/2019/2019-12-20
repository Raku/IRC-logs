[13:09] <Guest38485> lizmat: doing any cool opts?

[13:09] <lizmat> still working on making val() faster

[13:10] <lizmat> it's tougher than I thought  :-)

[18:18] <sena_kun> nqp tests are failing, is that just me? t/nqp/081-radix.t ...................... Failed 18/334 subtests 

[18:20] * lizmat checks

[18:23] <lizmat> sena_kun: passes fine for me?

[18:24] <lizmat> I assume this is on the Moar backend ?

[18:24] <sena_kun> lizmat: moar backend

[18:24] <sena_kun> do you use moar from master?

[18:24] <sena_kun> I am using 2019.11 tag, maybe that's why

[18:24] <lizmat> no, the one from MOAR_VERSION

[18:25] <sena_kun> 2019.11-93-g7a93b2897?

[18:25] <lizmat> building with 2019.11-94-g0e0f5bf6d now

[18:26] <lizmat> yes, I built with 93 before

[18:26] * sena_kun tries out with MOAR_REVISION this time

[18:27] *** kalkin joined
[18:27] <lizmat> also clean with 94 for me

[18:30] <sena_kun> lizmat: thanks for checking!

[20:58] <sena_kun> releasable6: status

[20:58] <releasable6> sena_kun, Next release in â‰ˆ22 hours. There are no known blockers. 0 out of 282 commits logged

[20:58] <releasable6> sena_kun, Details: https://gist.github.com/91fb644eb8ec30671a70367bc27d486a

[21:09] <dogbert17> so, has Blin been run lately?

[21:12] <sena_kun> dogbert17: that's a good question, I have access to a suitable machine, just need to actually find out a way to run it

[21:14] * sena_kun runs it

[21:14] <dogbert17> ++sena_kun

[21:15] <sena_kun> I have a strong feeling toward making a release, though we need a moar one before that

[21:16] *** kalkin joined
[21:20] <dogbert17> I'm all for it. It's probably a clever move to look at the results of a Blin run first though.

[21:38] <sena_kun> no doubt

[21:38] <sena_kun> 111 out of 1345 modules processed

[21:39] <dogbert17> what kind of system are you using?

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> also, did you install these dependencies: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/wiki ?

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> otherwise some modules won't be tested properly

[22:39] *** sena_kun left
[22:43] <AlexDaniel> I'd be surprised if the first run is clean
