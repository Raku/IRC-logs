[00:40] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: claudio.ulyssis.be/var/tmp/output_withsshfix.tar.gz

[01:20] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: ok that's a bit more believable

[01:21] <AlexDaniel> still no Unicode::GCB though :S

[01:22] <AlexDaniel> but less modules are ‚ÄúOK‚Äù

[01:22] <El_Che> didn't look,at the rapport

[01:22] <El_Che> more modules were tested?

[01:23] <AlexDaniel> less

[01:23] <AlexDaniel> I mean‚Ä¶ I'm not sure

[01:23] <El_Che> weird

[01:25] <AlexDaniel> ===> Searching for: Acme::Cow

[01:25] <AlexDaniel> ===> Found: Acme::Cow6:ver<0.0.1>:auth<cpan:ELIZABETH> [via Zef::Repository::LocalCache]

[01:25] <AlexDaniel> that's not right?

[01:26] <AlexDaniel> or is it? I'm not sure

[01:26] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: anyway, that's what I wanted to see, thank you!

[01:27] <El_Che> ping me if more tests are needed or changes to the img

[01:29] <AlexDaniel> thanks!

[01:38] <El_Che> no, thx you ;)

[10:42] <jmerelo> Hey

[10:43] <jmerelo> Old docs are for the time being deployed in https://docs-stage.perl6.org

[10:43] <jmerelo> Every primary page has a link to the new page in docs.raku.org in the footer.

[10:43] <jmerelo> It's still in stage, just in case someone wants to do it in some other way, maybe with a more prominent deprecation notice or something.

[10:44] <jmerelo> This is the relevant issue: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/3046 Please check it out and use it to discuss and suggest improvements.

[10:45] <jmerelo> releasable6: status

[10:45] <releasable6> jmerelo, Next release will happen when it's ready. There are no known blockers. 248 out of 454 commits logged (‚ö† 9 warnings)

[17:15] <MasterDuke> huh. this gist https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e3ad9a1aa995e2da53114957ca13e4b1 has a patch i tried and the new/changed error it causes. `Q:qq:cc/\1/` used to cause 'Unrecognized backslash sequence: '\1'. Did you mean $0?', but now causes 'This representation (P6int) does not support positional access (for type BOOTInt)'

[19:40] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: Added a file with the binary dependencies so it can be used as the configuration for the image and the documentation of the needed pkgs

[19:40] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: https://github.com/nxadm/raku-blin-docker/blob/master/pkg-dependencies

[19:41] <El_Che> if something is missing or new modules with binary depenencies need to be tested, that's the place to add them

[19:45] *** Altai-man_ left
[19:47] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: that's awesome

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: that's really really good

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: any chance we can get that back into the main repo? https://github.com/perl6/Blin

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: also, can you have comments in that file?

[19:56] <lucasb> while trying some changes to core code, I got the error "This type (List) does not support positional operations". It doesn't make sense right?

[19:57] <moritz> weird stuff happens when you screw up core :D

[19:57] <moritz> this could be a type not being fully composed yet, or a missing decont

[19:58] <moritz> or an actually bogus error message

[19:59] <lucasb> ah :( I won't have the knowledge to hunt that down

[19:59] <timotimo> it does make sense

[19:59] <timotimo> you have to getattr the $!reified or something out of the List object

[20:00] <timotimo> lucasb: ^

[20:01] <lucasb> the only thing I changed was Capture.perl. The error comes from regex tests... because Match is a Capture. So maybe the problem isn't my changes fault :)

[20:01] <lucasb> but my change made the bug visible 

[20:01] <timotimo> m: say Match.^mro

[20:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e7aa2626: OUTPUT: ¬´((Match) (Capture) (Cool) (Any) (Mu))‚ê§¬ª

[20:01] <timotimo> oh, i see

[20:02] <timotimo> so some code was expecting Capture to hold low-level arrays inside the list rpoperty?

[20:08] <lucasb> hope someone can take a look :) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3258#issuecomment-549173390

[20:09] <lucasb> the intention is to make \('a'=>1, :a(2)) output as-is, not as \(:a(1), :a(2))

[20:09] <timotimo> right

[20:09] <timotimo> i remember that

[20:11] *** cfa left
[20:12] <timotimo> the existing code should have already tripped over List objects if this is the spot it happens on

[20:12] <timotimo> is there a helpful backtrace with --ll-exception? does it just end in the Capture.perl method?

[20:15] <timotimo> oh, lucasb, since methods have a *% parameter by default, maybe just always pass :arglist there, independent of whether it's a Pair or not

[20:16] <lucasb> that was my original thought. So maybe it's ok to drop the Pair test

[20:24] <lucasb> ha! sorry, my rakudo wasn't up to date https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/efd7146c422453a9e2e87ea3228db48c143d0791

[20:25] <lucasb> error was comming from this samemark stuff 

[20:27] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: comments? What type? Skip lines that start with #? Something else?

[20:28] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I'm thinking about mentioning which modules depend on which packages, like here: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/wiki

[20:29] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I just use a oneliner; depending on the format a lot is possible with sed/awk/perl/raku

[20:29] <El_Che> now is just "give the contents of the file to apt-get" :)

[20:31] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: columns, splits and so on are easy to do: awk -F\; '{print $2}' (print the 2nd column of a ";" separated file

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: right

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: it's kinda unfortunate that there's no better way to do it

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> ideally this info should be in META6.json file in some form

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> because right now adding to this list helps blin but doesn't improve the user experience

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> that is, the user still has to figure out which dependencies they need to install

[20:40] <El_Che> a suggest system per OS would be nice

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: right, but a suggest system based on *what*

[20:41] <El_Che> you mean install at run time? (possible but less evident)

[20:42] <AlexDaniel> like we can have zef say something like ‚ÄúNative dependencies are missing, you can install them by running `apt install libwhatever-whatever`‚Äù

[20:42] <El_Che> "debian_suggest": [ "libfoo-dev", "foobar2" ], centos_sugget: "[...]"

[20:42] <rba> btw. maettu made Blin running in 164m25.818s. is this good to go?

[20:42] <AlexDaniel> rba: PERFECT.

[20:43] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: however, if you want the user to add dependencies at run time, I'll need to adapt the image a little

[20:44] <El_Che> we can use the -e (environment switch)

[20:44] <El_Che> docker run -ti -e PKGS="libfoo libbar3 libzork" rakudo/blin

[20:45] <El_Che> the dblin wrapper could wrap that (read env vars, or use switches etc)

[20:45] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: about merging, sure, but maybe best when we figure out what we need and want

[20:52] <AlexDaniel> rba: I think you're aware of it but it doesn't hurt mentioning it again. Blin installs all modules in the ecosystem, meaning that it takes one idiot to include some destructive garbage in their code to take down parts of your system. Running it in a docker image isn't too bad, but still be aware that angry code can explore your local network, abuse kernel bugs, etc.

[20:52] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: what you did is exactly what I wanted :)

[20:53] <rba> Yes. I told to maettu to make sure the firewall does block all except the internet.

[20:53] <El_Che> rba: have a look running it with podman instead of docker

[20:53] <El_Che> rba: is does not requires root

[20:54] <rba> El_Che: got it and proxied it to maettu

[20:55] <El_Che> rba: great

[21:02] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: tbrowder self-assigned =defn block parsing is not complete https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3275

[21:05] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: for now it skips lines starting with # in the pkg-dependencies

[21:16] <MasterDuke> i thought META6.json already had a section specced for native dependencies?

[21:22] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: re: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/wiki . It looks like 2 colum setup. We can do a 2 column file saparated by ";" (or something else, like white space), with a header that will be skipped

[21:23] <El_Che> pkg; module info

[21:23] <El_Che> t META6.json already had a section specced for

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I'm not entirely sure what it means. Should we then have a squashathon for PR-ing this section to modules that have native dependencies?

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: then we can write a script that uses that info to figure out which debian dependencies need to be install, so that it generates that file automatically

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> installed*

[23:48] <El_Che> Going to bed, but I am proposing a format that we can easily parse without extra libs

[23:48] <El_Che> the file itself can be autogrnerated

[23:55] <El_Che> maybe it makes more sense to generaye q simple pkg file from whatever complex format we have for doc
