[20:42] <tyil> did anybody test rakudo-star-2019.11-rc1 and find any issues?

[20:43] <tyil> if not I'd like to continue to make it a normal official release, but I'll need to look into getting the information to rakudo.org as well

[21:27] <patrickb> o/

[21:27] <tellable6> 2019-12-14T01:28:25Z #raku-dev <AlexDaniel> patrickb: no idea if it'll break anything. It probably will

[21:27] <tellable6> 2019-12-14T01:28:51Z #raku-dev <AlexDaniel> patrickb: IIRC that redirect doesn't just redirect to github, it also provides proper redirects for files

[21:27] <tellable6> 2019-12-14T01:29:23Z #raku-dev <AlexDaniel> patrickb: so if you depended on links to existing files in the past, then, if I'm not wrong, they still work

[21:28] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Have the files on rakudo.org been recovered or are they still only hosted on github?

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: these are the same files anyway

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: my last interaction with this issue was that I started uploading the tars to some server, and then rba told me to stop because the server didn't have enough space to host the tars

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> I think this is now resolved

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> but I haven't done anything about it since

[21:31] <patrickb> I'd like to have a listing of all files. Are there any files other than the src .tar.gz files?

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: .asc signatures, yes

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> rba: â†‘ have any links?

[21:35] <rba> patrickb: The files are all recovered.

[21:35] <tellable6> 2019-12-14T15:44:48Z #raku-dev <patrickb> rba It seems it's not entirely clear if it's safe to remove the forward. So please don't remove it for now.

[21:35] <tellable6> hey rba, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/4f083665e3f65725aff968d8821b1eef

[21:35] <rba> AlexDaniel: We have additional space now.

[21:36] <patrickb> rba: Could you send me a list of all the release files? (star, rakudo and nqp)

[21:37] <rba> Sure. Give me a sec. Or do you like access to the server?

[21:39] <patrickb> rba: I'm fine with a list for now. :-)

[21:40] <patrickb> rba: On a different topic: Any news wrt access to the macos machine of yours? I would provide me a chance to build stuff on macos...

[21:42] <rba> patrickb: Give me some more days. I will make the Macos ready around xmas.

[21:43] <patrickb> rba: I have no time presure wrt the macos machine, so no hurries. And I know, not helpful. :-)

[21:43] <rba> patrickb: ack :-)

[21:51] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I just changed the ChangeLog Wiki page adding a highlights text template as recently discussed: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: nice! It's a good start

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> all that's left is to motivate people to do that :D

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> ok the smiley is unnecessary, I'm actually optimistic about this

[22:06] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: patrickbkr++ created pull request #3355: Adapt release message template

[22:06] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3355

[22:07] <rba> AlexDaniel: Free space for more rakudo builds on the webserver is 4.5G atm.
