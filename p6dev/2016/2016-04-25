[07:52] <lizmat> m: say "foo" if v2.1 ~~ v1.2.3+

[07:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar f05c77: OUTPUT«foo␤»

[07:53] <lizmat> Woodi: aka, 1.2.3+ *will* match 2.1

[07:53] <masak> if I understand Woodi's point, it's that it's dangerous that the `+` matches *all* higher versions, not just the higher ones on the lowest version level

[07:53] <masak> I'm not sure I agree, but that's how I understand his point

[07:54] <lizmat> ah, perhaps that's a bug then

[07:54] <Woodi> yes, bicouse versions are not linear thing

[07:55] <lizmat> ah, I think I know what is going on...

[07:55] <masak> I don't know what the spec'd behavior is

[07:55] <masak> I was talking morality, not legality ;)

[07:56] <lizmat> I'm not sure this is specced more than pretty handwavy

[07:56] <masak> I don't have time to check right now; will try later

[07:57] <Woodi> current implementation work at least :)  some science-applied version can be sone someday...

[07:57] <Woodi> damn... I realy need to make drafts of irc messages before sending...

[07:58] <masak> lizmat: QAH already wound down? how was it? I really wish I could've come...

[07:59] <masak> lizmat: any immediate consequences for the p6 ecosystem?

[08:04] <brrt> what, QAH was when?

[08:04] <brrt> (i'm missing everything this year it seems :-o)

[08:06] <masak> brrt: Thu-Sun, methinks

[08:07] <brrt> .... oh well

[08:08] <brrt> maybe in some future time we'll have hackathons and i'll have time

[08:08] <brrt> weird, weird reframe-jit bug

[08:15] <lizmat> QAH is winding down

[08:15] <lizmat> the last people are leaving...

[08:16] <lizmat> some people are still hacking until they're thrown out

[08:17] <lizmat> masak: we weren't ready for the QAH, really

[08:18] <lizmat> but we connected a lot on a personal level, which should make things easier in the coming months

[08:18] <masak> who are "we"? the Perl 6 community?

[08:19] <lizmat> "we" as all the people at the QAH

[08:19] <masak> the people at the QAH weren't ready for the QAH?

[08:19] <lizmat> ah, that "we"

[08:19] <masak> :P

[08:19] <lizmat> sorry, yes that was ambiguious

[08:19] <masak> yes, sorry :)

[08:19] <lizmat> "we" as Perl 6 hackers, weren't ready for QAH

[08:20] <masak> well, that's a data point

[08:20] <lizmat> "we" as all the people, connected a lot

[08:20] <masak> nodnod

[08:20] <lizmat> I mean, we're still trying to get CUR on the road...

[08:20] <lizmat> on the bright side, mst will be switching on P6 distribution upload on PAUSE again soon

[08:21] <lizmat> so that blocker should be gone

[08:21] <masak> sounds good

[08:21] <lizmat> meanwhile, I have a P6W to prepare, and do some 7 hours of travelling ahead

[08:21] <lizmat> leont's PR with prove6 has been merged

[08:22] <masak> cool

[08:22] <lizmat> nine's patch landed, allowing BEGIN EVAL $string in pre-compiled modules

[08:23] <lizmat> jnthn has a short list of reproducible test file failures (which are usually rare flappers)

[08:23] <[TuxCM]> This is Rakudo version 2016.04-33-gf05c77b built on MoarVM version 2016.04

[08:23] <[TuxCM]> test            21.481

[08:23] <[TuxCM]> test-t          12.744

[08:23] <[TuxCM]> csv-parser      23.568

[08:24] <brrt> well, that's progress innit :-)

[12:37] <awwaiid> oops. I meant my request for review to go here

[12:37] <awwaiid> hoelzro (or anyone interested in REPLness): I updated https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/738 so it now works with jvm. I haven't tried on windows yet to see if that is different.

[12:38] <timotimo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/756  -  this is the pull-request that goes with update_profile_usage; i'd like someone who knows more about how a usage output should be formatted to look over this

[12:43] <[Coke]> (pr with prove 6) landed where? nom?

[12:44] <timotimo> yes, nom

[12:44] <timotimo> but you have to set an env var to actually use it

[12:45] <[Coke]> acking the repo for prove6 doesn't show anything.

[12:45] <timotimo> gimme a sec :)

[12:47] <timotimo> i ... can't find it in the irc backlog :o

[12:48] <[Coke]> ah, t/harness6

[12:48] <timotimo> ah! just search for files with a 6 in their name, clearly

[12:49] <[Coke]> there's a 200 in t/harness6 also, btw.

[13:19] <[Coke]> we have a few unanswered perl6-user emails if someone wants to be the face of perl6 this week. :)

[13:19] <timotimo> butterflyface? :)

[13:50] <stmuk_> NativeHelpers-Blob

[13:51] <stmuk_> that fails on 32 bit Windows .. does anyone know if it works on 64 bit?

[14:15] <stmuk_> hmmm I suspect Linenoise doesn't work on any arch of Windows anyway

[14:15] <stmuk_> at least MSVC/nmake

[14:16] <hoelzro> stmuk_: Linenoise *should* work on Windows; I can't confirm with MSVC, though

[14:17] <hoelzro> awwaiid: I saw your updates yesterday; nice work! I was a bit swamped, so I didn't get a chance to really look through

[14:26] <stmuk_> hoelzro: you use cygwin I guess?

[14:26] <hoelzro> stmuk_: it's been a while since I set things up, but iirc I just use the tools that came with Strawberry Perl

[14:27] <stmuk_> ah I should try that .. mingw I guess

[14:34] *** cognominal joined
[15:12] <timotimo> stmuk_: fails in what way? "failed to find offset"?

[15:12] <timotimo> that's something i thought was fixed a few weeks ago

[15:14] <stmuk_> timotimo: well I see the dependency NativeHelpers-Blob fail to install due to test failure on 32 bit MSVC and was also reading https://github.com/hoelzro/p6-linenoise/issues/13

[15:15] <stmuk_> windows linenoise didnt work in the Jan R* MSI (based on MSVC) either

[15:16] <hoelzro> stmuk_: that issue has to do with building the MSI with MSVC|GCC and then installing Linenoise on a system that has the other compiler

[15:16] <timotimo> oof, that issue was open a long time since the last activity ;(

[15:21] <stmuk_> I'm wondering if building the MSI is possible with the Strawberry tools since I'm not a MSVC fan

[15:24] <ugexe> won't that just result in Linenoise failing when building with msvc? if so, whats deciding to use the wrong compiler?

[15:31] <MadcapJake> So i just did `git pull upstream nom` applied my patch, config'd and make'd, now `./perl6 -v` says "2015.11-1620-gf05c77b" why would that be?

[15:31] <ugexe> did you make/make install it?

[15:32] <ugexe> if you just make (and dont `make install`) it won't work

[15:33] <MadcapJake> yeah I just make'd

[15:33] <ugexe> well, not that it wont work. but usually i have enough artifacts and stuff laying around that i have to

[15:33] <MadcapJake> yeah i keep getting this dependency error too,

[15:34] <MadcapJake> "Unhandled exception: Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/QRegex.nqp' (from 'src/Perl6/Pod.nqp')"

[15:34] <ugexe> that seems like what i would get until i `make install`

[15:34] * MadcapJake really wishes he could have a separate rakudo for hacking

[15:36] <ugexe> i just put my rakudobrew perl6 at the start of PATH, and my dev perl6s somewhere else

[15:36] <ugexe> so `make install` doesnt affect my regular perl6 incantation

[15:36] <MadcapJake> ahh that's a good idea

[15:37] <MadcapJake> make install gives me "no writeable path" error, is it because I didn't provide a prefix?

[15:37] <ugexe> eh, i've never even used prefix so i hope not

[15:38] <ugexe> maybe check git log to make sure you are actually on a modern commit and not that 2015 one it showed earlier

[15:38] <MadcapJake> yep i am

[15:39] <ugexe> hmm. well the no writable path error is from (i believe) CUR::*s

[15:39] <MadcapJake> install-core-dist.pl it says

[15:40] <psch> well, the version from -v is "$(cat VERSION)-{$num-of-commits-sinse-last-version}-{$git-ref}"

[15:40] <psch> and if that starts with 2015.11 something is up with your VERSION file, i'd say

[15:40] <MadcapJake> weird because `cat VERSION` returns 2016.04

[15:41] <geekosaur> it's not just using git describe?

[15:41] <geekosaur> (which would suggest maybe a tag is checked out)

[15:41] <psch> geekosaur: oh, yeah, no.  you're right i think

[15:41] <geekosaur> (although in that case git should be whining about detached HEAD)

[15:41] <psch> git describe does what i said there i assume

[15:42] <ugexe> rakudo/install/share/perl6 (this is where install-core-dists.pl saves to)

[15:42] <geekosaur> hm, or just for some reason not on nom itself and the closest annotated tag in the history is 2015.11

[15:42] <MadcapJake> should I remove that directory? maybe it won't overwrite?

[15:42] <geekosaur> git status

[15:42] <geekosaur> and, maybe, git branch

[15:42] <MadcapJake> geekosaur: on branch nom, one modified file

[15:42] <ugexe> MadcapJake: if its a modern rakudo you should be able to delete it

[15:43] <psch> git clean -xdf

[15:43] <psch> orr maybe cd .. && rm -rf rakudo # :P

[15:43] <MadcapJake> lol

[15:43] <psch> well, maybe copy the patch first :)

[15:43] <MadcapJake> ok i did git clean now I'll recompile

[15:44] <MadcapJake> psch: it's a 3 letter patch :P

[15:44] <geekosaur> hm... maybe: git fetch --tags

[15:51] <MadcapJake> well git clean appears to have solved it! thanks all!

[15:54] <geekosaur> actualy I think we should have thought of that first; iirc there is a known (but undiagnosed) glitch in updating git checkouts from 2015.11 to something more recent

[15:55] <geekosaur> we just haven't seen it much since 2016.01 because most people had gotten past it by then

[15:55] <MadcapJake> ahh lol I was late to the party

[16:11] <MadcapJake> how do i install modules for use with rakudo? I tried installing panda against rakudo and it still just sees all the rakudobrew modules.

[16:26] <RabidGravy> I'm not quite sure what the distinction is

[16:37] <psch> panda just uses the perl6 in your path, no?
