[13:46] <Skarsnik> Hello, I am not sure if someone remember my leak issue with rakudo/moar and the XML module. I was curious if it's finally fixed, but it's still here (even if it's smaller than before) https://gist.github.com/Skarsnik/03b970d2a4b827ba1e1d  It was fixed for some revision it seem according to this gist

[13:49] <nine> Skarsnik: we're in #perl6-dev now :) Freenode likes a project's channels to have a common prefix

[13:49] <Skarsnik> thx :)

[13:52] <tadzik> soo, this is #p6dev freenode?

[13:52] <tadzik> I know this is a "what year is it" question, but seems like I have a bug to report for a certain messaging platform :)

[13:53] <nine> tadzik: it is :)

[13:54] <nine> tadzik: it's 2016 btw

[13:56] <tadzik> danke :)
