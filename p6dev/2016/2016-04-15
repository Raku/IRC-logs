[07:39] <[Tux]> csv-parser      26.119

[07:40] * [Tux] would still like to see instructions in how to use rakudobrew with bleeding-edge MoarVM

[07:40] <[Tux]> This is Rakudo version 2016.03-118-g4f3f1c8 built on MoarVM version 2016.03-108-gca1a21a

[07:50] <masak> [Tux]: in the best case, it's just a matter of descending into the nqp/MoarVM/ folder, checking out latest, and rebuilding moar and nqp, then rakudo

[07:51] <masak> s/folder/directory/ :)

[07:56] <[Tux]> http://www.xs4all.nl/~hmbrand/git-refresh-all is what I do before make

[07:56] *** dalek joined
[07:56] <[Tux]> so that already forces nqp/MoarVM to most recent master

[07:57] *** RabidGravy joined
[08:26] <jnthn> masak: You only need to rebuild moar in most cases :)

[08:27] <masak> ah, cool

[15:30] <nine> jnthn: OMG! It runs!

[15:31] *** RabidGravy joined
[15:32] <nine> It's butt ugly and hacky and panda still fails to install, but it clearly shows that I have a chance of succeeding :)

[15:41] <pmurias> nine: what did just run?

[15:43] <nine> pmurias: An EVAL as part of module loading during precompilation of a module. Been working for over a month at this.

[16:14] <nine> Oh and I think I actually know why panda still fails. I even TODOed it.

[18:54] <nine> And panda's bootstrap works! panda's first run after bootstrap takes 1.8 seconds. Just like the second run :)

[18:54] <nine> And since it now uses File::Which which uses NativeCall, this is actually a quite thourough test case.

[18:54] <RabidGravy> harr!

[18:54] <RabidGravy> nine++

[19:06] <timotimo> wowza

[19:06] *** vendethiel joined
[19:09] <nine> Btw. it will become faster with a future update. Right now I have to re-check dependencies when trying to load a precomp file from a non-HEAD repository. I can improve that to only check when a repo was actually changed (by installing a dist).
