[11:31] <[Coke]> stmuk_: I was able to run hello world and p6doc.

[11:32] <[Coke]> I wonder if, in the future, if it makes sense to pre-compile star DMGs, since we know what the install dir looks like.

[11:34] <[Coke]> I can't use panda install on my own module, but I'm used to network failures when I'm at work.

[11:35] <[Coke]> Looks good. Thanks for putting that together!

[11:37] <timotimo> awesome

[14:12] <stmuk_> [Coke]: thanks! precomp sounds a good idea too

[14:13] <timotimo> oh, yeah, precomp bites us often enough

[14:41] <[Tux]> This is Rakudo version 2016.04-40-gf7613f7 built on MoarVM version 2016.04

[14:42] <timotimo> uh oh

[14:42] <timotimo> times's going up again?

[15:01] * masak .oO( time's up! )

[15:23] <hoelzro> has anyone on Windows noticed an issue where the moar runner builder doesn't work because $*DISTRO.Str eq 'mswin32 (6.3)' or something similar?

[15:23] <hoelzro> I was building a fresh rakudo on Windows last night and this happened to me; wondering if anyone else has seen it

[15:39] <tomboy64> i somehow broke rakudo compilation; it worked last night. https://bpaste.net/show/639b63cc1986

[15:40] <tomboy64> are .nqp files supposed to be installed with nqp?

[15:51] <hoelzro> also, I set up a VM for Windows building so I could test there without rebooting, but for some reason, running perl6-m fails because it's a batch file, and /bin/sh invoked by gmake doesn't seem to like batch files.  Does that sound familiar to anyone on Windows?

[16:12] <stmuk_> hoelzro: I built star ok with MSVC but failed with the strawberry perl mingw but I didn't see a moar runner issue on wither

[16:13] <hoelzro> hmm

[16:13] <hoelzro> strawberry is what I'm using atm; I didn't see this before, but that was months ago

[16:13] <stmuk_> I think mingw failed to build moar even

[16:13] <stmuk_> I was using 32 bit

[16:14] <hoelzro> I got the build to work once I fixed the moar runner issue

[16:14] <hoelzro> (using 64 bit)

[16:14] <hoelzro> I should probably make my VM use MSVC

[16:15] <stmuk_> SB P 5.22.1003 32 bit and MSVC 2013 community

[18:54] <[Coke]> tomboy64: do you mean to be working on the jvm?

[19:03] <tomboy64> [Coke]: yes

[19:04] <tomboy64> [Coke]: i see the QRegex.nqp being built with nqp, but it's not getting installed along with the .jar and the .moarvm files

[19:08] <[Coke]> it's probably getting compiled to moarvm, or included in a different file.

[19:09] <[Coke]> but I'd have to check to be sure.

[19:30] <[Coke]> someone broke make -j

[19:59] <[Coke]> so, the make problem appears to be the conversion of create-moar-runner to perl6 - it was changed to use perl6, but it's complaining that:

[21:18] <[Coke]> btw, I mentioned this on #toolchain, but I can't rakudobrew at work. I suspect something is trying to make a direct connection somewhere (either non HTTP or not respecting my HTTP proxy settings)

[21:29] <RabidGravy> [Coke], it appears to be working for me right now

[21:30] <RabidGravy> oh, wait proxy

[21:30] <RabidGravy> dunno then

[21:31] <RabidGravy> I thought it only used git to grab the stuff so it should just DTRT with the proxy
