[11:05] <RabidGravy> any ideas how .wrap() on a method would cause an SCRef to get leaked out at compile time?

[11:06] <RabidGravy> (the wrap itself is happening in a classes compose)

[19:29] <[Coke]> jnthn: I tried to follow through your last 6guts post, and of course all the info changed because you fixed the things you were reporting on. I find that "top objects" on the eval sample now is filled with <anon>

[19:29] <[Coke]> not sure if more distinction on <anon> stuff is possible.

[19:32] <timotimo> [Coke]: you need to check out an nqp branch to get fewer anons

[19:32] <[Coke]> ah.

[19:37] <timotimo> did you find it? i forgo twhat it's called, something with "debugname"?

[20:13] <[Coke]> nope, I just dropped it on the floor when you said that. :)

[20:28] <jnthn> I need to make that branch not bust the nqp-j build before I merge it :)
