[05:05] <masak> fwiw I can see the point of sticking to Freenode's guidelines.

[05:06] <masak> #perl6-dev is a lot clearer than #p6dev -- and it's not a big deal either way

[16:33] <nine> [Tux]: we're migrating to #perl6-dev to conform to Freenode channel naming guidelines

[16:35] <[Coke]> can a channel op change the topic to reflect that?

[16:35] <geekosaur> ...and can/should we move now, or be in both, or ?

[16:43] *** ilmari left
[16:50] <b2gills> Considering we have a number of #perl6-* and #p6dev is the only one that doesn't match it makes sense for a rename.

[16:50] <b2gills> Any new discussions should be on the new channel, any old discussions should be migrated (herding cats)

[16:52] <jnthn> so bikeshed...

[16:54] <b2gills> Pure bikeshed arguments should stay here ( especially if this one disappears )

[16:54] <jnthn> :D

[17:01] <RabidGravy> there's a simple way to fix this

[17:05] <hoelzro> so #p6dev → #perl6-dev ?

[17:07] <[Coke]> hoelzro: yes please.

[17:08] <hoelzro> ok
