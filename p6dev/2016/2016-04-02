[18:18] <awwaiid> eek re rakudo.org

[18:43] <timotimo> oh, rakudo.org lives again

[19:34] <nine> jnthn: in a somewhat desparate attempt, I've tried reversing my heading and use a separate SC for the EVAL but not push it onto the SC stack. Surprisingly I arrive at exactly the same error as with the shared SC: QAST -> MAST failed while compiling op callmethod: Serialization Error: missing static code ref (0x4ddb620) for closure '<unit>' sf cuuid (1) from 'perl6'

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Add kv adverb to first

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: This was first noticed [here](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-03-31#i_12267194)

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: The docs define first as

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: ````

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: multi sub    first(Mu $matcher, *@elems, :k, :kv, :p, :end)

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: multi method first(List:D:  Mu $matcher, :k, :kv, :p, :end)

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: ```

[21:09] <dalek> rakudo/nom: However there is no `:kv` adverb implemented. Although [S32](http://design.perl6.org/S32/Containers.html) does not mention a `first-kv`, there's a reasonable user expectation that `first` would have same adverbs as `grep`.

[21:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: We don't need a .Seq here

[21:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[21:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: The fact that .grep :kv returns a Seq, is because .grep can return

[21:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 0 through N elements.  .first always only returns 1 element, which

[21:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: is a Pair in the case of :p, and a List in the case of :kv
