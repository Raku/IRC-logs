[16:14] <nine> FWIW while certainly well intended, I don't think the source-line-number implementation is the right way to fix this. A CompUnit::DependencySpecification describes what should be loaded. Adding the source-line-number gives it a second, distinct meaning.

[16:15] <nine> For example, should these two be considered equivalent? CompUnit::DependencySpecification.new(:short-name<Foo>, :source-line-number(10)) and CompUnit::DependencySpecification.new(:short-name<Foo>, :source-line-number(20))?

[16:16] <nine> Also making the source-line-number required breaks perfectly ok 6.c code
