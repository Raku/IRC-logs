[12:03] <notagoodidea> If we can declare single signature object, can we provide them to a function at declaration time?

[12:04] <lizmat> not using Raku syntax, afaik

[12:05] <lizmat> should be possible to do using the MOP, because that's what the raku parser does as well  :-)

[12:05] <lizmat> but it would probably require creating the subroutines from scratch as well using the MOP, so probably pretty difficult

[12:05] <notagoodidea> mm, I feel that don't grasp enough of Raku to try to mess with the MOP.

[12:06] <lizmat> when the RakuAST branch lands, that should probably become a lot easier, but that will take at least until mid 2021

[12:07] <notagoodidea> I was hoping to do something like : ` my $sig = :(Int $a, Int $b); sub foo &sig {*}` or in the like

[12:07] <notagoodidea> With RakuAST, there is the macro project also? That will be easier with macro lisp-style if available.

[12:10] <lizmat> yes, the RakuAST branch is also intended to make macro's really work in Raku

[12:10] <lizmat> it was one of the reasons for starting that project

[13:01] <guifa2> What would be a good name for a Yes/No prompt module?  IO:YesNo? Prompt::YesNo? Or something else for the TLD?

[13:03] <notagoodidea> Prompt::YesOrNo ? Is it only for prompt or it is generalized to work with GUI or TUI like Ncurses?

[13:03] <timotimo> is it like a terminal thing or GUI or adaptive or something?

[13:07] <guifa2> CLI and only for prompting yes / no ‚Äî¬†trying to take advantage of CLDR's stuff

[13:08] <guifa2> So English would pop out: '[y/n] ', and process accordingly.  Spanish would have '[s/n] ', Korean '[Ïòà/ÏïÑÎãàÏöî] ', etc

[13:09] <notagoodidea> timotimo: The other day about the where clause, I found in the docs the Str $foo? where { !$foo.defined or $foo eq "foo" } for more robust optional positional argument + where clause without default values.

[13:12] <timotimo> right

[18:44] <jmerelo> .tell guifa2 IO::Prompt? IO::Boolean?

[18:44] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to guifa2

[18:51] <guifa2> jmerelo: the travis build failed because it's missing an external dependency

[18:51] <jmerelo> guifa2: right. I didn't drill down to search which was which. That something was missing was clear, anyhow.

[18:52] <guifa2> jmerelo: should I expect it to fail in that case?  I wasn't sure and didn't want to merge the PR if not

[18:52] <jmerelo> guifa2: of course. If it does not find it, it will simply fail.

[18:53] <guifa2> ah okay, I didn't know if it held onto all modules in the ecosystem (or built required dependencies as needed)

[18:53] <jmerelo> guifa2: it uses zef to try and install the dependencies, and clones the module (from the META6.json source) to try and install it, failing if it does not.

[18:54] <jmerelo> Basically tries to find out what would happen if you would try to install it once accepted into the ecosystem.

[18:54] <guifa2> yeah, that's weird that it says it can't find Intl::CLDR then

[18:54] <guifa2> it's clearly in the ecosystem

[18:55] <guifa2> (although I have to up my ulimit -n to install it, which might be the problem)

[18:56] <jmerelo> guifa2: let me have a look. Sometimes it happens because it's not available _in that phase_

[19:02] <guifa2> alright, I'm about to be afk, but let me know what you see.  Whatever stuff is happening here may be an issue for the future modules I'm pulling out of Intl::CLDR

[19:03] <jmerelo> guifa2: cool module, too :-)

[19:03] <guifa2> jmerelo: oh the cooler stuff is yet to come

[19:06] <jmerelo> guifa2: I can't install Intl::Cldr, there's an error

[19:12] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[19:13] <jmerelo> guifa2: you've got a PR. Going AFK again now.

[19:13] <guifa2> jmerelo: I just did an uninstall and reinstall and the error for Intl::CLDR was obvious.  Arg this is what happens when I don't try clean installs

[19:14] <jmerelo> guifa2: :-)

[19:14] <jmerelo> guifa2: no problem. I love your README.md with the quotations in Asturianu :-) Should do something with mine, making quotations in Ubed√≠ (which is not a thing, I know, but still...)

[19:15] <guifa2> jmerelo: I'm trying to add little quotes here and there.  I think Cam√µes is best for DateTime

[19:15] <guifa2> "Mudam-se os tempos, mudam-se as vontades" ;-)

[19:16] <jmerelo> guifa2: contraposed to "Il gatopardo", "Everything must change so that everything remains the same"

[19:16] <jmerelo> Haven't read Camoes. I don't think I've read anything by a Portuguese author.

[19:17] <jmerelo> guifa2: that's the thing with us peninsulars, we kind of ignore each other. Or rather we ignore the Portuguese, while they mostly know everything about us.

[19:17] <guifa2> also that PR I'm going to nuke the whole Intl::Numbers namespace instead, that's some of the stuff that's getting yanked out and put into new modules, so it should be in the META6.json at all (but the META6 is autogenerated now based on all module files, and I always forget to go back and remove stuff)

[19:17] <jmerelo> anyway, really going AFK now. Have a nice evening :-)
