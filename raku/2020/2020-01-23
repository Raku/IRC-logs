[03:25] <guifa> I think I remember once jnthn (or maybe lizmat)  saying that attribute access will always be faster than hash access.  Is the same true for array access?

[12:21] <kawaii> Is anyone able to help figure out what is wrong with our META6 file prevening install via Zef? :)

[12:21] <kawaii> https://github.com/shuppet/p6-api-discord/blob/master/META6.json

[12:21] <kawaii> someone suggested that git-based source-url's are no longer supported, but I can see other common modules using the same format

[12:30] <sena_kun> kawaii: and those modules are installed ok? :)

[12:30] <sena_kun> the format is incorrect indeed, something like https://github.com/croservices/cro-core.git works just nice, replace the user and repo name and it'll be ok

[12:30] <kawaii> sena_kun: yes, URI::Encode is one of them using the git: format

[12:31] <sena_kun> lemme see...

[12:31] <kawaii> But I'll try your suggestion once I'm back on my laptop :)

[12:32] <sena_kun> kawaii: maybe because Encode::URI has `/` and your url uses `:`?

[12:33] <sena_kun> I mean, [email@hidden.address] (note the colon) and "git://github.com/perl6-community-modules/URI-Encode.git".

[12:33] <sena_kun> this `:` looks suspicious to me

[12:33] <kawaii> ah that might be the issue

[12:34] <kawaii> good catch

[12:43] <kawaii> sena_kun: I'm still getting a failure :(

[12:43] <kawaii> zef isn't exactly very verbose about saying why

[14:20] <tbrowder> hi, #raku people  \o

[14:21] <tbrowder> i have a db program that manipulates a text database (flat file) and inserts it into either a postgres or sqlite db

[14:24] <tbrowder> currently i have to edit the prog with =begin/=end comment lines to select the module being used and the db commands which is not very elegant.

[14:25] <tbrowder> is there a way programmatically to select between the two?

[14:27] <tbrowder> off the top of my head i guess i should first isolate the db lines into their own modules.

[14:28] <tbrowder> then somewhere use a require statement to select the correct module for the desired db to use.

[14:28] <tbrowder> i should make the module interfaces the same.

[14:29] <lizmat> tbrowder: https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-if

[14:29] <kawaii> tyil: interesting, looks like I just had to wait a while but now I get a slightly different error https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/y2lnsh8L/

[14:31] <tyil> kawaii: looking at the META6.json, I'd say you're missing a protocol, and the git url used is incorrect

[14:31] <tbrowder> lizmat: thnx!

[14:31] <tyil> but looking at the scrollback I see people saying git:// is no longer accepted

[14:32] <tyil> `git://github.com:shuppets/p6-api-discord.git` is what I would expect

[14:32] <tyil> or `https://github.com/shuppet/p6-api-discord`

[14:33] <tyil> in any case, I would strongly suggest creating a tarball out of it, and using CPAN

[14:34] <kawaii> I don't really understand CPAN, I was never much of a perl5 guy :(

[14:34] <kawaii> but thanks, looks like this should work now

[14:34] <tyil> there's modules that can help you with that part, if desired :)

[14:34] <kawaii> it would probably be a good idea, can you link something for me to read? :)

[14:35] <tyil> I'm biased in favour of App::Assixt, but I'm not even sure if it works on any system that isn't mine. I'ev heard of people using mi6 as well

[14:35] <lizmat> https://modules.raku.org/dist/App::Mi6:cpan:SKAJI

[14:35] <lizmat> is what I use  :-)

[14:35] <lizmat> but that's mainly because that was around before App::Assixt was

[14:35] <tyil> I don't have any good documentation on how to upload to CPAN manually, the docs I found when I was making my own modules were... not very beginner friendly

[14:36] <kawaii> I'll try both and see which suits my workflow better, thanks :)

[14:36] <lizmat> I've had about 100 Perl modules on CPAN, and never had to upload manually  :-)

[14:36] <kawaii> lizmat++

[14:36] <kawaii> tyil++

[14:36] <tyil> good luck ^_^

[15:33] <rypervenche> So I asked this question yesterday and didn't get an answer. I'm going to try again, but it might be a stupid question. I noticed I could change a for loop into a single line using X. I'm curious to know if anyone would recommend using this more idiomatic way of expressing this or not. https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/d150531a7411ef200f3d5c3487975f54/revisions

[15:37] <lizmat> rypervenche:  ^^  something like that ?

[15:39] <rypervenche> lizmat: So @char-sets is an array of sets that I want to loop through, essentially. So long as at least one character from my password is in each set then it's good.

[15:41] <lizmat> ah, an additional level of indirection

[15:42] <lizmat> I guess I would create a hash with char -> Set mapping

[15:44] <lizmat> and then change $password.comb.Set to $password.comb.map( { %char2set{$_} } ).Set

[15:45] <rypervenche> Ah, so you wouldn't do it either of my ways, haha. I'll try this out. Thanks.

[15:47] <lizmat> of course, the %c2s initialization could be done programmatically from your array of sets  :-)

[15:49] <rypervenche> Would eqv work though since my sets have "all possible characters of a certain type" and my password would only have some of them?

[15:50] <lizmat> the hash should map all possible characters of a set to a single value

[15:50] <lizmat> it's only *those* values that we check

[15:51] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2,2,3,4).Set  eqv (1,2,3,4).Set

[15:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar bde106981: OUTPUT: Â«Bool::Falseâ¤Â»

[15:51] <rypervenche> Interesting. I'll see if I can make that work then. Thanks again.

[15:52] <lizmat> I guess you could also use (>=) or (<=) but I find eqv to be better expression what you want

[15:55] <rypervenche> So the way I set mine up with the (elem) is unnecessarily convoluted then?

[15:56] <lizmat> convolution is in the eye of the beholder, I merely looked at what I understood to be the desired outcome and how *I* would do it

[15:57] <lizmat> if you're interested in how each solution performs, I suggest you benchmark it  :-)

[15:57] *** wamba left
[15:57] <lizmat> if you're not, then you should go with whatever will be best maintainable for you  :-)

[16:01] <rypervenche> Ok. I'm still very new to this (coding in general) and am a perfectionist. I'm really liking the multiple ways to do something thing, but also like having a "best" way to do something. I'll try out the hash way and see how I like it.

[16:08] <lizmat> it's just learning to ride a bike  :-)

[16:08] <lizmat> *like

[16:10] <japhb> rypervenche: Are you familiar with the concept of the "Pareto frontier"?  If not, in short: If you have more than one dimension on which you can optimize, then you will often get situations in which it is impossible to improve *all* of those dimensions simultaneously.  There is quite often no *single* best way to do something, but there is often an identifiable "edge" to the space of possibilities where each 

[16:10] <japhb> choice on that edge ("frontier") is the best it can be on some dimensions without making any other dimensions worse.

[16:10] <rypervenche> I know I'll learn better ways to do things as I use the language as well. This channel's been very friendly and helpful, which is very welcoming.

[16:11] <japhb> In other words, if you care about more than one thing, you are usually forced to trade off, but still have an identifiable set of "better" choices.

[17:47] <lizmat> uzl[m] re "A routine can be both a subroutine and a method in which case you can call it using the subroutine call syntax and method call syntax respectively."

[17:47] <lizmat> with the following example: those are not the same thing being called

[17:48] <lizmat> the first is a 'sub say' the latter is the method "say" on the Str object

[17:49] <lizmat> so I think that example is confusing in light of what you're saying next: which is that you can call a sub as a method

[17:49] <lizmat> the example would imply that you do *not* need the extra syntax

[18:13] <tbrowder> lizmat: turns out the if module is for compile time use. i had to use "require" and then painful dynamic lookups for choosing the module as an input arg

[18:13] *** mmnhhg left
[18:14] <tbrowder> but it works

[18:14] <lizmat> but, the check is dependent on command line args, no ?

[18:14] <tbrowder> not as i read the use of "if"

[18:15] <lizmat> I mean, how do you specify which version you want, as a command line parameter ?

[18:18] <tbrowder> i created a var that is default true to use DB::Pg. then an input arg can change that to false in which case i require DB::SQLite instead. then, after the if/else i assign to local vars the values from exported symbols in the selected modules (if that makes any sense). the docs section on PACKAGES shows how to do it

[18:19] *** DrForr joined
[18:20] <tbrowder> "use DB::Pg" should read "require DB::Pg", same for DB::SQLite

[18:20] <DrForr> Howdy! I'm gathering ideas for Raku demo snippets that we can put on our new FOSDEM banner.

[18:21] <tbrowder> it's pretty slick, but the syntax is a bit tricky

[18:25] <lizmat> tbrowder: I see...  well, if you have an idea for a better idea for syntax, please make a problem solving issue

[18:26] <lizmat> DrForr: (1..Inf).grep( *.is-prime ).skip(999).head    # the 1000th prime number

[18:27] <DrForr> I'll of course replace Inf with the bloody Unicode symbol...

[18:27] <[Coke]> â if you need a copy. :)

[18:28] <DrForr> Heh. I was just going for the Character panel.

[18:28] <lizmat> DrForr: elements of a list not occurring in the second list: say (1,2,3,4,5) (-) (4,3,1)

[18:28] <lizmat> m: say (1,2,3,4,5) (-) (4,3,1)

[18:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 666f95c1a: OUTPUT: Â«set(2 5)â¤Â»

[18:29] <DrForr> I've got some sigilless examples, unicode sigma, postfix !...

[18:29] <DrForr> I'm already doing two (-) fib # to show the numbers that occur in both...

[18:29] <lizmat> m: say 42 (elem) 1..100    

[18:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 666f95c1a: OUTPUT: Â«Trueâ¤Â»

[18:30] <lizmat> tbrowder: would it be terrible to load both modules, and then during execution select the class ?

[18:31] <DrForr> I'm tempted to show off numerics with the Bernoulli numbers...

[18:33] <DrForr> Also, what are the Unicode characters used to generate the flag symbols you use on slides

[18:33] <DrForr> s/$/?

[18:34] <tbrowder> well, they arenât classes but i thought about that but didnât go with it because i thought that would take more work,

[18:34] <tobs> I find the R metaop and junctions particularly cool, but can't come up with some shining example

[18:35] <DrForr> I had one on a slide where I deliberately used it to get rid of a paren, but it wasn't worthwhile.

[18:35] <tbrowder> but thatâs probably the best thing to do.

[18:36] <lizmat> DrForr: something about throwing dice

[18:37] <tbrowder> maybe iâll do that someday after my todo list is empty!

[18:37] <lizmat> m: say <1 2 3 4 5 6>.pick(3)

[18:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 666f95c1a: OUTPUT: Â«(4 5 1)â¤Â»

[18:37] <DrForr> Something like (1..6).pick then...

[18:37] <lizmat> with the dice symbols

[18:38] <DrForr> Oh, (('A',1...9,'J','Q','K') Z <C D H S>).pick

[18:38] <DrForr> (2..10 that is)

[18:39] <lizmat> m: say ("â" .. "â").pick(3)

[18:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 666f95c1a: OUTPUT: Â«(â â â)â¤Â»

[18:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 666f95c1a: ( no output )

[18:41] <guifa> uzl[m]: I enjoyed it.  I also kind of wish more people would get used to the âmethod object: argsâ (method as sub) calling structure, because I use it a fair amount and I feel like Iâm the only one ha

[18:43] <hsmyers> @tbrowder a URL for your load method? I'm looking at https://docs.perl6.org/language/packages and not seeing anything (but I'm a newbie therfore blindish)

[18:43] <lizmat> am I missing something, but isn't that just syntactic sugar for 'object.method: args' ?

[18:45] *** sena_kun left
[18:47] <guifa> lizmat: yeah.  But sometimes if I have a series of sub calls, it just visually looks better to write it the other way around because then I can more easily line up elements

[18:47] <lizmat> ok, fair enough...  :-)

[18:49] <guifa> Itâs nice though that you have the option, just like postfixed if/for/etc.  Exactly the same at the core, but help promote readability / emphasis when you need it.

[18:49] <tbrowder> hsmyers: in the PACKAGES section the subsection "interpolating into names" shows how to access objects in loaded packages.

[18:50] <tbrowder> the loading part i got in the modules page, "require" subsection

[18:50] <guifa> also lizmat: I still havenât had my PAUSE account approved, so I canât start transitioning my stuff to there =\  Not sure if you have any powers yonder

[18:51] <hsmyers> Thanks @tbrowder, missed that!

[18:51] <tbrowder> i think some of the "require" syntax is a bit misleading, and i intend to look into it.

[18:52] <lizmat> guifa: pinging some people

[18:54] <tbrowder> all that said, i think lizmat's suggestion of using a class to be selected at run time is better, it certainly will result in cleaner code in the calling script

[18:55] <lizmat> looks like each module load is about 20msecs, not sure how important that is for you

[19:03] <DrForr> Thanks all, I'm trying to get the banners ready for FOSDEM and we need some quickie examples.

[19:03] <hsmyers> @tbrowder Turns out can't use that/those approaches since I want conditional use of Grammar::Debugger which has to be high up in code chain to work.

[19:05] <guifa> lizmat: thatâs correct

[19:06] <tbrowder> hm, what condition are you testing? you might check out the "if" module lizmat suggested.

[19:07] <tbrowder> hsmeyers: ^^^

[19:09] <DrForr> Hrm, is there a way to make the Argand identity work out? (e**(i*pi))==-1 (it evaluates to very *nearly* -1...)

[19:10] <hsmyers> @tbrowder condition isn't the problem, GD has to be "used" before anything else happens in order to take over like it does. Grammar::Tracer works same way.

[19:11] <tbrowder> yes but did you look at the "if" module? it might do the trick

[19:11] <hsmyers> will now :)

[19:29] * DrForr waves to jmerelo 

[19:29] <jmerelo> Hey, DrForr 

[19:31] <tobs> DrForr: pretty sure complex arithmetic always degrades to Num (because it has to). So unless this expression is hardwired into Rakudo, I'm afraid it won't work in a symbolic, lossless way.

[19:32] <guifa> jmerelo: Actually, I wouldnât mind having you take a look at the tech chapter beforehand.  Most of my committee is more oriented towards literary analysis (the bulk of the diss) so they probably canât catch any smaller mistakes

[19:32] <DrForr> tobs - I figured as much, but it'll let me show off the =~= operator and (more importantly) the Unicode equivalent.

[19:34] <DrForr> And yeah, I think there are some better closed forms for the Argand expression, but sadly the margin of the banner is too small to contain them.

[19:35] <guifa> tobs: right now at least.  One of these days (sadly not anytime soon) Iâd like to start adding in a symbolic math engine.  Sticking to the basis of square roots, trigs, and pi shouldnât be tooooooooooooo hard and cover a lot more use cases than the current complex numbers does.

[19:35] <hsmyers> tbrowder, @lizmet, if failed, line 21. Use of uninitialized value of type Any in numeric contextâ¦

[19:36] <tbrowder> bummer

[19:36] <tbrowder> can you show the pertinent code in a gist?

[19:37] <hsmyers> @tbrowder: my $DEBUGGER = 1;

[19:38] <hsmyers> @tbrowder, then runâ¦

[19:39] <hsmyers> Also use if; befor use lib <path>; causes problemsâ¦

[19:41] <tbrowder> well, i'm sorry i can't help. i just put '=begin/=end comment' lines around the "use ..." lines

[19:41] <tbrowder> to turn the debugger code off

[19:51] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! PDF::Font::Loader (0.2.8) by 03WARRINGD

[19:55] <[Coke]> We should probably add slightly more info to https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=PDF%3A%3AFont%3A%3ALoader so it's clear why there are two responses that look so similar.

[19:55] <[Coke]> (I think it's: one is an official CPAN release, the other is "what github has")

[20:01] <guifa> [Coke]: I think all that has to be done is remove it from the github ecosystem page, and then itâll get removed from the scrap (I think).  I know Iâve seen a few edits to the ecosystem page for that reason

[20:01] *** domidumont left
[20:06] <[Coke]> I could see wanting both, but also it'd be nice to know at a glance which kind of module it was (cpan "released" or github "latest")

[20:06] <[Coke]> so even if in that case one was removed, knowing what kind was left might be nice

[20:08] <guifa> Or even merging them into a single entry, with a link for CPAN and for Github.  Some small text could alert that CPAN = release, Github = most recent / pot unstable

[20:09] <guifa> https://pasteboard.co/IRlkZoN.png <â not camelia this time, but seriously, anyone who hates Camelia just doesnât realize how much stuff can be done with butterflies 

[20:11] <El_Che> guifa: I like butterflies but dislike camelia. It's not the same thing :)

[20:13] <lizmat> guifa: I like it  :-)

[20:13] <El_Che> guifa: they can even be used as ninja stars: https://www.thetvjunkies.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TildaITB.gif

[20:13] *** rindolf left
[20:14] <El_Che> guifa: is a nice image. If you accept postive critique, I would change the "for Raku" font and he light blue blackground.

[20:15] <El_Che> The lower part of the butterfly could be darker, I think

[20:15] <guifa> El_Che: I did think about the font and I might still change it.  Iâve been fairly consistent in all the images so far with using Courier for the âfor Rakuâ bit, but I sâpose I donât need to actually be that consistent

[20:16] <El_Che> Thing is that everthing else is fliud

[20:16] <El_Che> background, smoke, round wings, fluent font

[20:16] <El_Che> so "for Raku" feels copy pasted

[20:16] * guifa is definitely willing to make some for other modules.  Imagine if searching Modules in modules.raku.org had cool images

[20:16] <El_Che> totally out of place

[20:18] <El_Che> guifa: I like how the butterflies feels calm and steady and the smoke wild and unpredictable

[20:18] <El_Che> great opposition

[20:20] *** lichtkind joined
[20:20] <uzl[m]> lizmat: re Regarding the "extra syntax", would it be better to remove the example altogether or replace it with something else? Or probably rephrase the sentence?

[20:20] <lichtkind> is there a inf for Int?

[20:21] <uzl[m]> No, I wasn't aware you could use grep that way ðð (I'll leave the example and mention the same thing can be achieved with grep). 

[20:22] <uzl[m]> jmerelo, samebchase : Thanks. Will try to increase the font size.

[20:22] <lizmat> uzl[m] My "issue" is that the example is not an example of the situation you're describing with 'sub multiply'

[20:22] <lizmat> there *is* a "sub say"  and a method "Any.say"

[20:23] <guifa> El_Che: I tried doing a plain white before, but it didnât work as well as I would have liked =\  I adjusted the fonts and did some levels adjustment on the butterfly.  Looks much better thanks! 

[20:25] <El_Che> guifa: it's always handy to have people with artistic skill in a project

[20:25] <El_Che> sometime a good illustration make boring pages pop

[21:48] <lucs> How the * does precompilation work? Every once in a while, my code trips up on precomp related stuff and I have no idea how to fix it.

[21:48] <DrForr> Yes, thank you very much for stepping up!

[21:49] <lizmat> lucs: feels a doc issue is in place  ?

[21:50] <lucs> lizmat: I vaguely remember someone recently working on some precomp docs. Not sure where/what/who though.

[21:50] <lizmat> patrickb ?

[21:50] <lucs> Really can't remember :/

[21:51] <lucs> In the meantime: https://gist.github.com/lucs/bf0e5374cfd6ee4d26c430d81fcf7a36

[21:51] <[Coke]> lucs: (precomp) if your goal is to learn how it works, I'd tag @niner.

[21:52] <[Coke]> and if it's figure out how to work around a bug...

[21:52] <[Coke]> is Lucs::Volumes something I can install with zef?

[21:52] <lucs> No, sorry.

[21:53] <lucs> (Hmm... I'll try reinstalling it here. Who knows...)

[21:53] * [Coke] realizes he doesn't have p6doc installed.

[21:54] <DrForr> Aaah, p6doc is what I was looking for a few nights ago while rewriting stuff...
