[11:30] <Xliff> Can you .wrap a block?

[11:30] <Xliff> Now that I look at https://docs.raku.org/type/Block, I'm beginning to think not.

[11:30] <Xliff> If that's true, how could one go about it?

[11:31] <Xliff> Or at least convert a block to a Routine.

[11:32] <Xliff> m: my $a = -> $a { $a * 2 }; $a.wrap: { say 'wrapped'; nextsame }; 

[11:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3d8e942f0: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'wrap' for invocant of type 'Block'.  Did you mean any‚ê§of these: 'grep', 'map', 'Map', 'WHAT'?‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[12:20] <raku-bridge> <pie_flavor> In the docs, the Packages page has lots to say about how to interpolate arbitrary variables into FQ names, but not how to turn FQ names into local names. Does Raku have any sort of import/use/using/alias construct, and if so, where should I have been looking for it in the docs?

[17:39] <Xliff> Well, I'd need the specs for that and I'd try.

[17:39] <Xliff> However when I am asking if there is a deserializer and someone answers back "write one?" I get a little discouraged.

[17:40] <Xliff> sena_kun: Is the answer: "No"?

[17:41] <sena_kun> Xliff, if there is no such a module in the ecosystem (and there is no such judging by https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=PHP), I suspect the answer is "no". The good news is that grammars make it pretty easy to do, I think.

[17:41] <Xliff> Yeah. That's what I'm looking at right now.

[17:43] <sena_kun> And Raku is not a very mature language with hundreds of thousands of libraries anyway. "Write one" can be either encouraging and discouraging depending on how you look at it, I think.

[17:44] <Xliff> Well... I'm gonna try and write it.

[17:44] <Xliff> Wanna test when i'm done? :)

[17:44] <sena_kun> Xliff, good luck! Well, I am not working with PHP, but automated tests are our best friends.

[17:45] <sena_kun> Xliff, I think you have plenty of experience with all the really complex projects you achieved so far. :) But I will gladly look at the code as I wrote a couple of such.

[20:28] <timotimo> would anybody be upset if the output format of stagestats would change significantly?

[20:30] *** guifa is now known as crickets

[20:30] * crickets stridulates

[20:31] *** crickets is now known as guifa

[20:34] <MasterDuke> timotimo: your nested stats change? or did that already land?

[20:34] <timotimo> that already landed

[21:02] <leont> Does anyone know why the arch aur package for rakudo hasn't been updated to 2020.11?

[21:13] <MasterDuke> it usually only takes a day or two after i flag it out of date to get updated. but i've forgotten the last couple releases

[21:14] <MasterDuke> just flagged them

[21:29] <stoned75> I'm a bit surprised that there are so little occurences of the words [rl]value in Raku's doc

[22:53] <codesections> Question: do we have an installation method that we prefer to direct new users too?

[22:53] <tellable6> 2020-11-29T12:22:36Z #raku <patrickb> codesections: Do you know what the legal requirements for putting the logo of some company on the website is? Do the companies have to fromally approve?

[22:55] <codesections> (I'm asking because I'm hopeful that the various Advent posts will attract new users and I'm not sure which way to point them)

[22:57] <guifa> Generally Rakudo star

[22:58] <codesections> In particular, my Advent post (which is scheduled for a few hours from now) links people to a README that I'm finishing up right now

[22:58] <guifa> Although for the Mac that can cause problems because of the lack of code signing ( tyil: I‚Äôm still going to get to work on that, sorry for the delay)

[23:09] <tyil> guifa: I'm not in a hurry myself

[23:10] <tyil> mac users should still be able to compile it like the GNU+Linux users

[23:11] <guifa> Yeah, the problem with that is they need to have the developer tools to do that, and that‚Äôs a double digit GB download =/

[23:11] <guifa> but I‚Äôve got two weeks of isolation coming so ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll figure it out :-)

[23:21] <[Coke]> codesections: need approval from someone at the company to mention them on the site/use the logo. And I would ask them to send an email from a corporate account so we have tracking.

[23:21] <[Coke]> (and if someone asks for it to be removed, we need to respond)

[23:22] *** xinming_ joined
[23:24] <codesections> [Coke]: did you intend to mention patrickb rather than me?

[23:27] <guifa> tyil: ha, thankfully we wouldn‚Äôt need to serve those up.  Mac OS is pretty good in that case about letting the user know in the first instance of trying to run any of those tools that they need to download them, and then conveniently walking them through the process.  But still‚Ä¶. not ideal when perl and python, etc, are all preinstalled and ready to go

[23:27] <tyil> maybe with some time, Raku will be part of the pre-installed base ;D

[23:29] <codesections> yeah, that *must* be why they removed Python ‚Äì just to open up a slot for us!

[23:29] <tyil> we can dream

[23:32] <[Coke]> codesections: oops. yes.

[23:33] <[Coke]> his send was sandwiched by two of yours, and I mis-scanned.

[23:33] <codesections> That's what it looked like

[23:41] <codesections> How do we usually spell Rakuans?

[23:42] <tyil> can you give a definition?

[23:42] <codesections> Rakoons?

[23:42] <tyil> a, raku users

[23:42] <tyil> I call them rakoons

[23:42] <codesections> yeah 

[23:43] <tyil> but there's no official word for it I think

[23:43] <tyil> something for the rsc to make a choice in? ;D

[23:44] <codesections> yeah, just looking for a reasonable/consensus spelling, not for anything official!
