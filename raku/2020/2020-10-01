[00:17] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: “The pieces are there to make some really nice games in Raku.”

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> did you mean “some really basic games”? :P

[00:18] <rypervenche> Rosettacode has 2048, if you want to play that :D ><

[00:19] <guifa> rypervenche: ha, you actually have an even MORE updated Exceptions file than I do lol.  I found one or two more that I didn’t take care in the AST

[00:20] <rypervenche> Yeah, I updated it today. Although it's the same as your es.rakumod, minus the ! to . changes that I made.

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> just because something is technically possible with a lot of effort doesn't make the tool suitable for the task

[00:21] <guifa> rypervenche: tbh, what I do is just try to compile and keep fixing the errors as I went ha.  That literally dictated the first translations I did in Asturian, and those are the ones that have notes already created for them

[00:25] <moon-child> I made a little thing in raku and c/opengl, using c for most of the graphics bits

[00:25] <moon-child> that's probably not what you're talking about, though :)

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> I've heard a lot of far-fetched things on this channel but Raku for game development probably takes the cake

[00:29] <moon-child> I mean, there are the SDL&cairo bindings, and https://github.com/timo/gtk_cairo_shooter

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> and you do what with it?

[00:30] <guifa> Define game though.  I’ve been working on a port of some classic text adventure games, seems to work well lol

[00:30] <moon-child> AlexDaniel: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[00:30] <moon-child> I also originally made https://github.com/moon-chilled/libport to call the other way, and see if I could make a game engine scripted by raku

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> I like this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/ixo408/how_would_you_describe_raku_in_one_sentence/g6d75ld/

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> it's about using words that others don't understand the same way

[00:34] <guifa> rypervenche: use Intl::X ‘zh-TW’; sub ($a) { EVAL $a }; foo ‘say 42’; 

[00:34] <guifa> EVAL 是很危險的函式！！！ (use the MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL pragma to override this error but only if you're VERY sure your data contains no injection attacks).

[00:36] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: i don't actually have the free time to do it, but godot with gdnative could be use to embed a moarvm + rakudo inside godot

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: I mean, come on, everything is technically possible. But we can't be saying things without any honest connection with the reality. No JIT on ARM means mobile games are out, browser games via webassembly are not realistic at this moment. Even using Raku for backend of multiplayer games would be a terrible choice for performance reasons. You're left with open-source native games that don't demand performance. That's an extremely

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> small niche, and even there Raku would be a terrible choice because all other goddamn languages exists and work well.

[00:57] <moon-child> isn't mvm js backend still a thing?

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> still a thing? Was it a thing? :)

[00:59] <AlexDaniel> s/exists/exist/

[01:00] <timotimo> not mvm js

[01:00] <timotimo> nqp js

[01:16] <AlexDaniel> there are a lot of things that *can* be done in this world but it doesn't mean they should be done. I use Raku for real time camera motion control. Wow, Raku used for a practical real world application, right. And you know what? I regret every single line of it. Having to deal with performance and memory issues (on a system that needs to do video encoding, you know!) and not being able to increase iteration frequencies because of a

[01:16] <AlexDaniel> constant fear that raku itself will ruin my work (sometimes intermittently), when I could've used literally any other programming language and would've been so much happier with that particular use case. Don't tell people to write games in Raku, please.

[06:36] <jmerelo> frot-lab: I'm afraid you'll have to install them all over again... The process of installation of packages is version-specific, so you need to do that every time.

[07:03] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: is it? For example, rakubrew rolls over to newer versions without the need to reinstall packages

[07:03] <AlexDaniel> I don't know the specifics of binary releases but shouldn't it also be possible?

[07:04] <AlexDaniel> moreover, even if it's not possible, you can still use zef to install modules into a specific directory which you can then add to PERL6LIB

[07:04] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: not too familiar with rakubrew, just started using it. Anyway, frot-lab was asking about binary packages.

[07:04] <AlexDaniel> yes, you'll need to just wait for precompilation when you update rakudo, but no need to issue install commands from scratch

[07:05] <AlexDaniel> but frankly I have never used binary releases so I'm talking out of my ass x)

[12:21] <tbrowder> hi, my new blog site is on line at <https://zola-blogs.us> as a WIP. i will be fleshing it out during the next couple of days. it is not restricted to Raku but any programmer/dev type is welcome. suggestions always welcome.

[12:22] <tbrowder> it is hosted on github with markdown source so it should be easy use and update.

[12:25] <tbrowder> it is supposed to be https but cert gen is still incomplete on github side

[12:34] *** frot-lab left
[12:42] <lizmat> tbrowder: any idea how long that's gonna take

[12:42] <lizmat> because accessing such a site on MacOS is a royal pain  :-)

[12:42] *** pamplemousse joined
[12:48] <El_Che> not much there yet :)

[12:57] <[Coke]> I have some repos that I prefaced with "p6-" to avoid confusion with their p5 counterparts. best practice going forward? no prefix? switch to raku?

[12:58] <[Coke]> e.g.: https://github.com/coke/p6-unicode-mangler (also regretting the name mangler now. :)

[12:58] <elcaro> [Coke]: I use `raku-`. I previously used `p6`, but  not just to avoid p5 confusion, but maybe one day I might want to publish a python library of the same name, who knows

[12:58] <lizmat> I guess if you still also have Perl  repoes, prefix with raku

[13:23] <lizmat> yes

[13:23] *** sno joined
[13:24] <tbrowder> oh, github says 24 hr, so hopefully later today

[13:24] <lizmat> I can wait for that  :-)

[13:26] <tbrowder> if i don't see any change by late pm i'll check with github support. i don't remember exactly when i went "live" but it was maybe 2300 yr time yesterday

[19:50] <El_Che> just looking if it publishes what it found 

[19:52] <El_Che> it didn't find any :)

[19:52] <El_Che> but it does nog look public, so thatś good

[19:53] <El_Che> (I guess it's easier to shoot yourself in the foot with C than Go :)

[19:53] <El_Che> )

[19:54] <MasterDuke> i tried enabling it for my moarvm fork. it didn't find anything (assuming i set it up correctly)

[20:18] <Zero_Dogg> How would I go about assigning a property of an object, when the name of the property is in a variable? Ie. given object $a with a property foo, and $prop = 'foo', I'd like to do something like $a.$prop = something

[20:20] <MasterDuke> m: class A { has $.a = 4 }; my $a = A.new; my $prop = "a"; say $a."$prop"()

[20:40] <guifa> [Coke]: both.  Data is self-contanied in the module, Although actually look at it now, I the start-of-week is in supplemental, so I need to manually add it and I haven’t done that yet.  Ooops

[20:41] <[Coke]> guifa: any guidance on test failurs?

[20:41] <[Coke]> *failures

[20:41] <guifa> [Coke]: Looking at that now. 

[20:41] <guifa> I’ve been doing some fairly large refactoring and I may have been overzealous somewhere with edits

[20:44] <guifa> Aah, META6.json I think.  I moved Intl/Numbers/NumberFinder into Intl/Token/Number

[21:43] <[Coke]> when running 'zef test .' in a module you're working on, is there a way to say "don't use the installed version of anything META6.json says it provides" ? (ugexe)
