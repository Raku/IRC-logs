[12:10] <Kaiepi> if i'm writing a lazy gather with a for loop in it for taking values, do i put lazy before both the gather and for or just the gather?

[12:12] <xinming> Kaiepi: You need lazy

[12:12] <Altreus> Where are ::?CLASS and ::?ROLE documented?

[12:14] <xinming> Kaiepi: something like this     my $res := lazy gather inflate-config(%config);

[12:14] <xinming> Kaiepi: This is the code in my script.

[12:18] <Kaiepi> a golf for what i have is `lazy gather { my @foo = ...; for @foo { take $_ } }`

[12:19] <xinming> Kaiepi: Yea

[12:19] <Kaiepi> Altreus, https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-::%3FCLASS apparently, but that's not very extensive...

[12:21] <Kaiepi> ::?CLASS/$?CLASS mean different things depending on what kind of type you use it in

[12:21] <Kaiepi> with classes it's always the class you're using it in itself, but with roles it's the class the role gets mixed into or punned as iirc

[12:23] <Kaiepi> ::?ROLE/$?ROLE is more straightforward, it's just the role itself you're using it in

[12:28] <Altreus> > with roles it's the class the role gets mixed into

[12:28] <Altreus> No it's not: Multi method 'from-json' with signature :(API::Discord::JSONy:D: $json, *%_) must be implemented by API::Discord::Channel::API::Discord::Channel::ButReal

[12:28] <Altreus> API::Discord::JSONy is the name of the role that contains ::?CLASS at that point

[12:31] <Altreus> That may also be a bug :P

[12:32] <Altreus> I've asked the same question on my issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3483#issuecomment-586585404

[12:33] <Altreus> That doc also doesn't say ::?ROLE at all

[12:44] <tbrowder> .tell lizmat see what you started: https://github.com/tbrowder/App-PigLatin-Raku/blob/master/README.md

[12:44] <Altreus> interesting - If there's only one method of a multi, or it's not multi, ::?CLASS resolves to the consuming class

[12:47] <Altreus> apparently it's more complex than that :D

[12:50] *** chloekek joined
[12:53] <Altreus> I can't reproduce the message I got :/

[13:14] <Altreus> Is there a handles but for attributes instead of methods, so that attribute assignment is passed through to the delegate object?

[13:15] *** lucasb joined
[13:20] <Altreus> Hmm, looks like setting attributes is already handled with an rw method, so handles should really export that behaviour

[18:53] <guifa> lizmat: Eh, maybe maybe not.  There are very good reasons for both ways and either way will lead inevitably to gotchas

[18:57] <guifa> But the way that Raku is doing it is just fine, the number of times that someone will work with combiner marks at the beginnign of the string is small.

[18:58] <guifa> Where it might really catch people is in regex when trying to parse other standards.  I know the JSON::Tiny had to do some slightly weird stuff (because the sequence quote, combining-tilde, quote, is perfectly valid as a string element in JSON)

[20:28] <TreyHarris> I jush discovered I have .precomp directories scattered virtually everywhere in my homedir, including in places where there's definitely no Raku code (like ~/.ssh/.precomp). Do new .precomps just get created whatever the cwd is when a command is issued?

[20:29] <TreyHarris> s/command is issued/Raku program is invoked/

[20:29] <sena_kun> TreyHarris: did you by accident set PERL6LIB to home?

[20:29] *** ctilmes left
[20:30] <sena_kun> not necessarily now, but before

[20:30] <TreyHarris> sena_kun: oh, it takes the first argument of PERL6LIB?

[20:30] <TreyHarris> that explains it, I errantly had '.' there before as we discussed a couple weeks ago

[20:30] *** grayrider joined
[20:31] <sena_kun> TreyHarris: it isn't, but on compiling it searches for everything in PERL6LIB, so it is likely a consequence of this. :(

[20:31] <TreyHarris> so even if there were no libraries in ~/.ssh, if $perl6lib[1] were '.', it would.... oh? huh

[20:31] <sena_kun> that's my guess, not a truth. :S

[20:32] <sena_kun> but even so, it seems odd to me to create .precomp if there are no files to compile around

[20:33] <TreyHarris> I haven't finished spot-checking but I think in those cases the contents are just like .precomp/70DADB84C1F635367560F789D898FE305353E566/0B/0BDF8C54D33921FEA066491D8D13C96A7CB144B9.repo-id as the only regular file

[20:34] <sena_kun> maybe it is wise to make it lazy until there will be anything to put in there... or not.

[21:18] <Kaiepi> did something change with how threading works?

[21:19] <Kaiepi> i use this short piece of code to test the thread safety of Trait::Traced and get an estimate on whether my changes affect its performance http://fpaste.scsys.co.uk/587831

[21:20] <Kaiepi> on 2020.01 this would trace on 2-3 threads at once but now it always traces as if it were entirely synchronous on master

[21:26] <Kaiepi> oh, it sometimes does manage to trace on a couple threads, but not very often

[21:26] <TreyHarris> sena_kun: searching each of the 423 .precomp dirs in my homedir, in all the ones that contain just 1-3 plain files, they're all '.lock' or '*.repo-id'. starting with dirs that have 4 or more, they start containing files with binary compunit data. 

[21:27] <TreyHarris> But in even one that has 48 plain files (cloning Raku/ecosystem), it has 46 *.repo-id's, one .lock, and one data blob

[21:29] <TreyHarris> okay, so, long story short: can I configure a single place for .precomp to go? given the mishegas over when rakudo attempts to write .precomps to system directories where the user has no write access, I'm guessing the answer is no?

[23:00] <TreyHarris> m: my $x = "231"; my $y = "235"; say(eager $x.Numeric..$y.Numeric);

[23:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´(231 232 233 234 235)‚ê§¬ª

[23:00] <TreyHarris> rypervenche: something like ^ ?

[23:03] <rypervenche> Hmmm, I guess I might have to pull out the two numbers and then create the list that way. I was hoping to be able to do something like this and then somehow convert it to a range:

[23:03] <rypervenche> $custom ~~ s/ (\d**1..3) '-' (\d**1..3) /($0..$1)/

[23:04] <TreyHarris> Altreus: See https://gist.github.com/treyharris/e029f2c0c05cbef65a9ed51e41ab2854 -- tobs is exactly right

[23:08] <guifa> rypervenche: this is where making little subs is really nice

[23:08] <guifa> sub to-range (\s) { Range.new: |s.comb(/<digit>+/)¬ª.Int }; say "182..439".&to-range

[23:08] <guifa> m: sub to-range (\s) { Range.new: |s.comb(/<digit>+/)¬ª.Int }; say "182..439".&to-range

[23:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´182..439‚ê§¬ª

[23:08] <guifa> now you can .&to-range on any string you want

[23:08] <rypervenche> ooOOoo, there's that magic that I didn't know how to do. I'll read up on all of those pieces. Thanks.

[23:09] <rypervenche> Out of curiosity, why a sigilless variable?

[23:13] <guifa> No particular reason in this case

[23:13] <TreyHarris> rypervenche: you can't modify a sigilless variable, so it makes that explicit

[23:13] <TreyHarris> sigilless parameter, I mean

[23:14] <guifa> ^^ that‚Äôs one of the reasons I use it in some of my subs, but strictly speaking, all variables are unmodifiable unless declared rewritable or copies

[23:14] <guifa> the sigilless just gives you a bit more visual reminder of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm constant‚Äù

[23:14] <rypervenche> Ahhh

[23:15] <TreyHarris> also, generally, using sigilless's in signatures makes it more likely that a calling syntax will conform if you're using lists as tuples or Slips or such

[23:16] <guifa> Also IIRC there‚Äôs some optizations that can happen in the background because of some ‚Ä¶.

[23:16] * guifa waves hands as if speaking gibberish

[23:16] <guifa> ‚Ä¶ and then profit

[23:17] * rypervenche nodnods.

[23:20] <Altreus> TreyHarris: tobs: thanks! How pesky!

[23:21] *** wildtrees left
[23:21] <TreyHarris> Well, REPL by their very name will evaluate-and-print, so any lazy thing will be evaluated unless you go to an effort to protect it from that

[23:23] <guifa> as to the rest of the sub, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward.   But the .&sub syntax is nice when you wish you had a method for something but it doesn‚Äôt exist

[23:23] *** wildtrees joined
[23:23] <guifa> It works great for writing custom coercers

[23:25] *** zakharyas left
[23:26] <Altreus> It didn't occur to me that that would count as evaluating :D

[23:26] <Altreus> lizmat: I hope this is fixable https://github.com/lizmat/Object-Delayed/issues/5

[23:26] <Altreus> I am going to bed :)

[23:26] <TreyHarris> one thing to keep in mind using comb like that... this is perfectly syntactical and perfectly wrong:

[23:27] <TreyHarris> Altreus: anything you type to a REPL is evaluated

[23:27] <TreyHarris> unless it has an escape character like in some REPL's like colon for :help

[23:28] <TreyHarris> m: sub to-range (\s) { Range.new: |s.comb(/<digit>+/) }; say eager ("182..193".&to-range)

[23:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´(182 183 192 193)‚ê§¬ª

[23:31] <guifa> ^^ correct.  comb always gives you a string, gotta be careful with that

[23:46] <lizmat> TreyHarris: if you use .comb with a Regex, you can also specify :match to get Match objects

[23:46] <lizmat> m: dd "a".comb(/./,:match)

[23:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´(Match.new(:orig("a"), :from(0), :pos(1)),).Seq‚ê§¬ª
