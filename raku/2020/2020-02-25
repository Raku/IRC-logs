[09:13] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I was thinking… that it’s possible some one would like, for example, count logged users using something like this: `event login-count { has $count = #login.count; match { login(#login)* } }`. The problem with that is that every new login will create a new login-count event… so I was thinking that we should have a syntax to say something like: acumulate everything,  but just emit new event for each 10 

[09:13] <SmokeMachine> new logins… or just emit 1/min for example...

[09:13] <SmokeMachine> what do you guys think?

[09:24] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: yes...

[09:25] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: I use rotors for that. But it involves converting Channels to Supplies and back...

[09:25] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: it works most of the time, anyway. I'm using it for my evolutionary algorithms.

[09:25] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: it would work with Supplies, creating a new supply out of an old one... No need for channels.

[09:27] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: that wouldn’t work for me… it should work at “rule” level… but I think the biggest problem for now (before implementing) is finding a good syntax for that...

[09:28] <SmokeMachine> I’m thinking in something like: `login()*/10` and `login()*/1min`...

[09:28] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: what do you think?

[09:50] <SmokeMachine> And, ofcourse: `bla() ** 10/2`

[09:52] <SmokeMachine> but that makes me think, what should this do? `bla() ** 10/3`? and this `bla() ** 10/2 bla() ** 9/3`?

[09:52] <SmokeMachine> Should the `/N` work only for the whole match?

[09:53] * lizmat clickbaits https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/02/24/2020-08-altered-noise/

[09:54] <SmokeMachine> that makes me think that maybe it would be better something like: `event login-count { has $count = #login.count; match(*/10) { login(#login)* } }`

[15:29] <masak> if TDD was ever made for anything, it's grammars. and vice versa.

[16:06] <jnthn> Looks right to me; I'm guessing the problem is elsewhere

[16:09] <abraxxa> I've changed it to a rule and removed all \h* and now it matches again

[16:10] <abraxxa> if the previous token or rule matched the linefeed and the four whitespace chars, will that make the ^^ not match?

[16:11] <abraxxa> problem is that the Grammar::Tracer output only contains the start of the matching previous line

[16:11] *** jmerelo joined
[16:13] <jnthn> Yes, the ^^ wants to be after the line feed, if the rule ate whitespace at the end of it that'll mean you're no longer at the start of a line...

[17:27] <rypervenche> I've got two arrays of equal size. I want to Z~ them together, but also add a '=' in between each created element. How might I accomplish this?

[17:29] <leont> By doing two Z~ ?

[17:32] <evalable6> cfa, rakudo-moar 196db682b: OUTPUT: «(1=4 2=5 3=6)␤»

[17:33] <jnthn> That's also cute...

[17:33] <rypervenche> Oooooh

[17:33] <jnthn> Also this one:

[17:33] <jnthn> m: my @a = 1, 2, 3; my @b = 4, 5, 6; say @a Z~ "=", * Z~ @b

[17:33] <evalable6> jnthn, rakudo-moar 196db682b: OUTPUT: «(1=4 2=5 3=6)␤»

[17:33] <cfa> nifty

[17:34] <leont> Whatever really is that whatever :-D

[17:35] <cfa> oh btw leont, i tried Getopt::Long as a drop-in replacement recently

[17:35] <cfa> very neat

[17:35] <cfa> one question: do you plan to auto-provide usage documentation?

[17:41] <rypervenche> Another kind of related question. Is it possible to have two arrays, one of variable names (with or without $, not sure if needed), and one of values, and combine them together while declaring them all at the same time? Much like: my ($var1, $var2) = <one two>; but where the first array is actually a variable?

[17:43] *** dakkar left
[17:43] <Doc_Holliwood> m: .say for (1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110... *)[0..10]

[17:43] <jnthn> No, because lexical declarations need to be known at compile time

[17:43] <evalable6> Doc_Holliwood, rakudo-moar 196db682b: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) Unable to deduce arithmetic or geometric sequence from 100,101,110 (or did you really mean '..'?)␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/aaJfExAX6t line 1␤␤»

[17:44] <rypervenche> In my mind it would look something like: my @var-names = @values;

[17:44] <leont> cfa: yeah I do, I just haven't gotten around to it

[17:45] <leont> One of the main factors is that I'm not entirely sure what I want the output to look like exactly

[17:47] <cfa> leont: neat

[17:47] <cfa> and yeah, understood

[17:47] <leont> The builtin one tends to become very confusing when one has many arguments (e.g. type "zef foo"), but I'm not quite sure what the alternative would look like

[17:49] * cfa nods

[17:49] <rypervenche> Oh! I missed jnthn's response. Hmm.

[17:50] <leont> Also, you may want to have a look at Getopt::Subcommands. It's a bit more experimental at this stage but the two-stage argument handling does seem like a good idea.

[17:54] <rypervenche> jnthn: I was looking to take some bash variables from a file (like: VAR1="$HOME/Desktop") and convert them into Raku syntax via a grammar, and possibly in the actions create our-scoped variables. That won't be possible then? Is there something similar that I could do?

[17:55] <jnthn> Depends what problem you're trying to solve. In theory you can write a module with an EXPORT, pass it the file, and it will export variables :)

[17:56] <jnthn> I did something like that once for shell commands (in a talk, as an example)

[17:56] <rypervenche> I was planning on turning this into a module, yeah.

[17:58] *** pecastro joined
[18:04] <cfa> leont: cool, will check that out

[18:05] <cfa> fwiw, i have no real issues with the builtin one... but for the = signs

[18:13] <leont> Yeah the = signs are the main reason why I needed something else as well

[18:13] <leont> But having more specific error messages for a lot of issues is a strong second reason

[18:13] <cfa> sounds good

[18:13] <cfa> i gather there was a motivation for using = in the first place

[18:17] <leont> It's essentially a design constraint of using a blind parser

[18:18] <leont> The default parser converts the command line arguments into a capture without knowing anything about those arguments, so it can't know --foo should take an argument or not

[18:18] <cfa> ah, okay

[18:19] <cfa> presumably that's in the typeless MAIN(:$foo) case?

[18:19] <cfa> because once you provide a type it's no longer ambiguous?

[18:19] <leont> The default parser doesn't look at MAIN at all until it has already parsed the arguments

[18:19] <cfa> aha

[18:21] <leont> Then it tries to dispatch to MAIN, and if that doesn't work prints the usage message

[18:21] <leont> That's why the error message is so non-specific, it only knows that the capture doesn't fit the sub, it doesn't know why.

[18:21] <cfa> i see

[18:22] <cfa> anyway, usability wise it's not wonderful: i tend to do --foo <TAB>, then insert the = after completion

[18:23] <cfa> where i'm completing a filename

[18:23] <cfa> (i doubt i'm alone in this)

[18:23] <leont> It's also why you definitely shouldn't do «Str $file where *.IO.f» like in one of documentation examples; the usage message really isn't really a replacement for "no such file $file"

[19:30] <moritz> cannot confirm

[19:30] <moritz> if I change the order, it still returns the one with color => 'blue'

[19:30] <lizmat> abraxxa: have you considered using objects rather than hashes?  then you could create an ACCEPTS method, which would be used inside the block of a first

[19:31] <moritz> m: my %looking-for = ( name => 'foo', color => 'blue' ); my @e = ( { name => 'bar', color => 'red', otherattr => 'baz' }, { name => 'foo', color => 'blue', otherattr => 'baz' },); say @e.first({ all( $_{%looking-for.keys} ~~ %looking-for.values)})

[19:32] <lizmat> or, if it is the same type of object, you wouldn't have to

[19:32] <abraxxa> moritz: I also need an exists check in there to silence the warnings

[19:33] <abraxxa> moritz: shouldn't the all function that an array?

[19:34] <moritz> abraxxa: this question no verb

[19:35] <moritz> abraxxa: Hash.keys returns a list (or at least something iterable)

[19:36] <abraxxa> there is no Hash to Hash comparision operator that doesn deep nested comparision?

[19:36] <abraxxa> moritz: yes, but that's in the one positional parameter to all which uses an operator to return True or False

[19:37] *** Altai-man_ left
[19:37] <abraxxa> moritz: or is the all like $_.all in this case?

[19:38] <moritz> all() returns a Junction

[19:38] <abraxxa> those myriads of types really suck!

[19:38] <discord6> <Highlander> (which will get boolified, and when it does it will be truthy only if "all" its components are truthy)

[19:38] <Voldenet> SmokeMachine: from what you've specified, I making rules on the whole collection of events would be more flexible - (#ev.count % 10 == 0), (#ev.last.date - #ev.first.date < 10m) - hiding that fact would be enormously leaky abstraction anyway

[19:38] <lizmat> abraxxa: again, why hashes ??

[19:39] <lizmat> feels to my you're applying Perl 5 idioms in Raku

[19:39] <abraxxa> lizmat: because the FortiManager API takes JSON

[19:39] <abraxxa> lizmat: of course I do, that's what I do since 20 years

[19:39] <moritz> but that doesn't mean you have to work with JSON-compatible data types *inside* your applicaiton

[19:39] <lizmat> well, using hashes is generally not the most performant way in Raku

[19:39] <abraxxa> it's not an application

[19:39] <lizmat> objects are *much* better optinizable

[19:40] <abraxxa> i don't care

[19:40] <abraxxa> write fast not run fast

[19:40] <moritz> abraxxa: s/application/code/ then

[19:40] <lizmat> *

[19:40] <abraxxa> raku is more in the way than it helps

[19:40] <abraxxa> I only choose it because of Grammars

[19:41] <lizmat> abraxxa: feels to me it is in the way because you're going against the flow  

[19:41] <discord6> <Highlander> I feel like there must be a way to do what you're trying to do without much hassle

[19:41] <abraxxa> Array.first doesn't even have an example using block syntax

[19:43] <discord6> <Highlander> Why again did moritz's solution not work as expected? Seems like it should do what you're asking for

[19:44] <abraxxa> moritz: this doesn't work: my %service = @existing-services.first({ all( $_{%service-lookup.keys}:exists && $_{%service-lookup.keys} eq %service-lookup.values )});

[19:44] <abraxxa> Use of uninitialized value %result{'dport'} of type Any in string context.

[19:44] <abraxxa> there is no %result anywhere in my code

[19:44] <moritz> m: my %looking-for = ( name => 'foo', color => 'blue' ); my @e = ( { name => 'bar', color => 'red', otherattr => 'baz' }, { name => 'foo', color => 'blue', otherattr => 'baz' },); say @e.first({ all($_{%looking-for.keys}:exists) && all( $_{%looking-for.keys} ~~ %looking-for.values)})

[21:57] <lizmat> so it should generate an infinite number of Inf's ?

[21:57] <jnthn> Hm, I wonder where the NaN comes from then...

[21:57] <Doc_Holliwood> it should die "Cannot count FROM infinity" or something
