[11:14] <timotimo> whatever currying doesn't go outwards through argument lists, which is what [+] takes

[11:15] <timotimo> otherwise $foo.map(*.bar) would be a whole whatevercode, rather than actually doing a map

[11:15] <timotimo> for [+] you can also just .sum afterwards

[18:03] <sena_kun> kjk, hmm, can't reproduce it with a scratch file... Do you have a proper SDK set in File -> Project Settings? It should not matter, but just in case.

[18:05] <kjk> yes, it says it's using project SDK: Raku v2020.01. I set it to C:\rakudo\bin

[18:06] <sena_kun> kjk, in the description I saw you also tried it on gnu/linux, right?

[18:06] <kjk> yeah, didn't work there either.

[18:08] <sena_kun> kjk, no exceptions from Comma (usually a red button in the right bottom corner)?

[18:08] <kjk> nope~

[18:10] <kjk> it looks like this: https://snipboard.io/c14ord.jpg

[18:11] <Doc_Holliwood> m: multi sub f(Int $x) { multi sub f(Rat $x) { say "R $x" }; multi sub f(Str $x) { say "S $x" }; $x %% 2 ?? f($x.Str) !! f($x / 2); }; f(2);

[18:11] <Doc_Holliwood> Yo dawg. I heard you like multis so i defined 2 multis with the multi lol

[20:38] <Xliff> jnthn: What about the compose key?

[20:43] <Xliff> Hunh>

[20:43] <Xliff> Comma says: "Subroutine say is not declared"

[20:43] <timotimo> was it unable to run your perl6 sdk stuff?

[20:44] <Xliff> No. It's not recognizing texas equivalents for « and »

[20:45] <Xliff> And I can't use unicode via compose key, which is a real deal killer for me.

[20:51] <Xliff> *sigh* -- and once again I am saddened to give up on Comma and go back to Atom.

[20:51] *** softmoth joined
[20:51] <Xliff> I'll keep trying, though. :/

[20:55] <timotimo> Xliff:compose key works on my machine

[20:56] <timotimo> let me double-check

[20:57] <timotimo> yeah even in comma

[20:58] *** rindolf left
[20:58] <Xliff> I'm running Gnome. Are you KDE?

[20:58] <timotimo> xfce4

[20:58] <Xliff> Weird.

[20:58] <timotimo> i've been called worse :)

[20:58] <Xliff> What are you using to set Compose key?

[20:59] <Xliff> Yes. I think I've thrown a few of those at you.

[20:59] <timotimo> it's already in my keyboard layout

[20:59] <Xliff> How was htat set?

[20:59] <Xliff> s/htat/that/

[20:59] <timotimo> hm

[20:59] <Xliff> I'm setting mine through GNOME tweaks

[20:59] <Xliff> So might not be getting low-level enough for Comma.

[21:00] <Xliff> And WHEEEE! A segfault.

[21:00] <timotimo> i really haven't looked at how xkbmaps are built

[21:01] <Xliff> 0x00007ffff4761c0e in p5_call_gv_two_args (my_perl=0x55555a357c70, gv=0x0, arg=0x55555bb508a8, arg2=0x55555966c370, count=0x5555557f1c48, type=0x5555557f1c50, 

[21:01] <Xliff>     err=0x5555557f1c58) at p5helper.c:893

[21:01] <Xliff> 893             SV * const rv = sv_2mortal(newRV((SV*)GvCV(gv)));

[21:01] <Xliff> I'm guessing gv should not be null...

[21:01] <Xliff> Fahrfignugen.... I'll need to recompile another rakudo with -g. :/

[21:02] <MasterDuke> Xliff: you just need to recompile moarvm, not nqp and/or rakudo also

[21:04] <timotimo>     // Tab as Multi_key (Compose)

[21:04] <timotimo>     // --------------------------------------------------------------

[21:04] <timotimo>     key  <TAB> { [ Tab,                     ISO_Left_Tab,            Multi_key,               ISO_Level5_Lock,         NoSymbol,                NoSymbol,                NoSymbol,                ISO_Level5_Lock          ] };

[21:04] <timotimo> Xliff:that's how it's set

[21:04] <timotimo> it's in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de

[21:08] <Xliff> *sigh*

[21:08] <Xliff> .../usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us: "XCompose is out! Unicode combining is in!"

[21:08] <timotimo> oh hum?

[21:08] <Xliff> Piss off... I want my XCompose.

[21:09] <timotimo> unicode combining, what si that?

[21:09] <timotimo> typing unicode numbers in with numbers and a through f?

[21:11] <Xliff> ?!?

[21:11] <Xliff> I have no idea.

[21:12] <Xliff> xev -event keyboard recognizes my multi-key though.
