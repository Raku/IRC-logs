[09:58] <jmerelo> It *should* work with source-url git uris. Also, we should maybe trim the lines so that it does not fail.

[10:43] <jmerelo> tbrowder: Cro::HTTP seems to fail lately with cert problems...

[10:44] <jmerelo> tbrowder: is that it?

[10:45] <Altai-man> jmerelo, how lately is "lately"?

[10:45] <tbrowder> no, i don't think so. i'm having to do a bit of trial-and-error with docs on zola deployment on github-pages

[10:46] <tbrowder> everyone else seems to like netlify

[10:47] <tbrowder> github doesn't help with the way they break down docs into microbyte chunks

[10:49] <tbrowder> why don't you want to use cpan for Toi?

[10:51] <tbrowder> so much easier than fooling with ecosystem, especially when using mi6

[10:54] <jmerelo> Altai-man: I've raised or updates a couple of issues, didn't you see them?

[10:54] <jmerelo> Altai-man: anyway, lately is today, when I've tried.

[10:55] <jmerelo> Altai-man: this one in Cro::TLS https://github.com/croservices/cro-tls/issues/3

[10:56] <Altai-man> Oh.

[10:56] <jmerelo> Altai-man: and a similar one in Cro::HTTP (after force-install that one)

[10:56] <Altai-man> jmerelo, just read it, those are some sad news. :|

[10:56] <Altai-man> I'll try to look into it when time allows.

[10:57] <jmerelo> Altai-man: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/111 

[10:58] <jmerelo> Altai-man: thanks. It seems to work after force-install anyway

[20:17] <pamplemousse> o/

[20:17] <pamplemousse> I'm looking at starting up a Raku Users Group in Atlanta, GA, USA after some expressed interest by people I know here, and was wondering if anyone had any pointers on what a good first meeting might look like?

[20:17] <pamplemousse> When I was in college, our local L.U.G. group's first meeting of the year was always an installathon to get any new folks set up on their preferred distro, but I want to make sure that the first meeting would be something that could appeal to new folks and experienced users alike

[20:18] <pamplemousse> Would an installathon still be a good way to go?

[20:21] <pamplemousse> We would be doing this virtually, or if enough people wanted to do it in person, socially distanced and masked, so making sure the first topic/activity is a thing that could work while spread out/not physically present would be important too

[20:23] *** approaching236 joined
[20:25] <lizmat> pamplemousse: more power to you

[20:25] <lizmat> my personal experience is that meetings should be friendly, fun, instructive and repeatable

[20:26] <lizmat> repeatable in the sense of having a fixed day of the month to meet, like the second Tuesday of the month

[20:26] <lizmat> afk again&

[20:30] <pamplemousse> Thanks for the advice, lizmat!

[20:30] <[Coke]> installathon sounds great - gives folks a way to get up to speed and then future meetings they already have a raku in place.

[20:32] <MasterDuke> but i think you would need more on the agenda than just that. for a lot of people it's only an `apt|yum|etc install rakudo` away

[20:32] <tbrowder> lizmat: \o/ zola-blogs.us is really online with https. no real content yet but at least i have the gh-pages doing the right thing. i'll get it looking a bit better by tomorrow evening

[20:33] <lizmat> confirm it worlks ok on MacOS and Safari  :-)

[20:33] <lizmat> really afk now&

[20:34] <tbrowder> arg, i lied, cert should be ready soon...

[20:36] <Xliff> .

[20:36] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Yes. That's what I meant

[20:36] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel

[20:41] <pamplemousse> MasterDuke: That was my thought, yeah. And even if everyone installed Rakudo in a way that would easily allow them to potentially contribute (by pulling and installing NQP, one of the backends, and Rakudo's repos), that still wouldn't take all that much time

[20:42] *** kylese left
[20:42] <MasterDuke> depending on when you're doing it, and how much work you want to do ahead of time, you could try to find some good hacktoberfest tickets to work on

[20:46] <pamplemousse> That's a great idea! I'll go dig through the tickets and see what issues I can find that could ease people into things
