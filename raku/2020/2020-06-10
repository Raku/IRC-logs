[00:53] <Xliff> Here's a weird one!

[00:54] <Xliff> "MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 181469784 in GC work pass"

[00:54] <Xliff> Suddenly started showing up in a compunit after a (supposedly) unrelated code change.

[00:57] <Xliff> Minor change in another piece of code and now it is showing up in a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT compunit!

[00:57] <Xliff> "MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID -1586283160 in GC work pas"

[01:08] <Xliff> Hopefully that has been fixed in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ff1558424bda5931e227204460933951f3dc8972

[01:08] <Xliff> I'll recompile, later.

[14:08] <grondilu> can the evalbot read multiline commands so that I show you the error ?

[14:10] <MasterDuke> i think it interprets ‚ê§ as newline. or you could try putting it in a gist and using evalable6

[14:10] *** MilkmanDan left
[14:11] <jnthn> When you have whitespace there you're using the `.` infix operator, not the `.` postfix operator, and the entire term that follows is the method call name, not a general termish, so stacking further postfixes won't work.

[14:13] *** MilkmanDan joined
[14:13] <grondilu> you're right.  I added parenthesis and it works.

[14:13] <Roamer`> even though jnthn explained, let me just say that it doesn't even need to be a newline, you can do it with any whitespace:

[14:13] <Roamer`> m: say 7.Rat .nude[0]

[15:25] <grondilu> oh, you're right.  I misread the doc

[15:25] <dakkar> it is a bit confusing that the sub takes the named argument, the method takes the positional‚Ä¶

[15:26] <oddp> Yeah, have a hard time with that as well.

[15:26] <oddp> zip(..., :&with)

[15:26] <oddp> reduce(..., &with)

[15:26] <oddp> classify(..., :as)

[15:26] <grondilu> it makes sense, though.  Naming the argument is not useful in the method form.

[15:26] <[Coke]> Should we unify that?

[15:26] *** rbt left
[15:26] <[Coke]> ah

[15:27] <dakkar> naming the argument is not *necessary* in the method form

[15:34] <dakkar> I forgot to actually write down the second half‚Ä¶

[15:35] <dakkar> but yes, `zip` needs the `with` to be named because it already takes an arbitrary number of positional arguments (the other things to zip)

[17:18] <lizmat> hoelzro: ecosystem should now use the community modules one

[17:19] <lizmat> I'm not sure how we could import the issues :-(

[17:19] <lizmat> perhaps AlexDaniel knows

[17:20] <AlexDaniel`> just transfer the repo?

[17:20] <AlexDaniel`> why fork it?

[17:20] * lizmat is a noob

[17:20] <AlexDaniel`> remove the fork, then transfer it :)

[17:20] <lizmat> how do I import it ?

[17:21] <AlexDaniel`> this will move all issues and stuff, and the original repo will redirect automatically for most queries

[17:21] <AlexDaniel`> hoelzro needs to do it

[17:21] <lizmat> aha...

[17:21] <lizmat> well, he can, as the name p6-linenoise is free atm

[17:21] <AlexDaniel`> and hoelzro needs to be added to the community-modules org, otherwise they won't be able to transfer

[17:23] <lizmat> so maybe I should create a Team with the access right for importing ?

[17:23] *** KindTwo joined
[17:23] <AlexDaniel`> I think all members can create repos (and if you can create repos then you can transfer too)

[17:24] <AlexDaniel`> but feel free to play with privileges

[17:24] <AlexDaniel`> same goes for the Raku org, it's even more complicated there

[17:24] <AlexDaniel`> e.g. see https://github.com/Raku/please-turn-off-the-autowatch-feature

[17:24] *** KindOne left
[17:24] <AlexDaniel`> I have some scripts that can sync members between orgs and teams

[17:25] <lizmat> I've added hoelzro as a member

[17:25] <AlexDaniel`> let me know if you need them

[17:25] <lizmat> put perhaps we're doing this the wrong way

[17:25] <AlexDaniel`> maybe!

[17:26] <lizmat> perhaps hoelzro should just give me maintain access to the linenoise repo, and then I can import it into community modules

[17:26] *** KindTwo is now known as KindOne
