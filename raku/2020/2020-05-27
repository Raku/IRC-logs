[11:06] <jmerelo> I don't know if you've been checkout out ecosystem modules lately; I'm doing so for the book and there's a big amount of them that does not work any more

[11:06] <jmerelo> And from those, a relatively good amount are not maintained either.

[11:06] *** shlomif2 left
[11:06] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, around 300 from all the modules we have.

[11:07] <jmerelo> Wow

[11:07] <Altai-man_> well, this is not wow, I think

[11:07] <jmerelo> Well, the wow is that some of them are relatively important "upstream" modules, with many depending on them

[11:07] <Altai-man_> >Showing 1565 results

[11:08] <jmerelo> I'm checking now Digest::MD5, for instance

[11:08] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, I can prepare blin if you want. And if you are not, it won't hurt anyway, I guess.

[11:08] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, Digest::MD5 tests and installs ok for me.

[11:08] <jmerelo> Altai-man_: it would probably make sense. Also, a hackathon...

[11:09] <jmerelo> https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5/issues/26

[11:09] <jmerelo> Just tried again, same problem

[11:10] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, can you remove zef cache and try again?

[11:10] <jmerelo> It downloads and installs just fine, but according to a response to a issue in zef, there was  problem with version numbers...

[11:11] <jmerelo> Altai-man_: yep, I can install it locally, no problem, but it's probably better if there's a version bump or something. Apparently the thing is that META6.json changes, version does not.

[11:11] *** andrzejku joined
[11:11] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, I did not install it locally, but with `zef install Digest::MD5`?

[11:13] <jmerelo> Altai-man_: What I'm saying is that it's anyway a problem with the version. Installing something should not depend on the cache state

[11:13] <jmerelo> And I guess this kind of modules are not the ones included in your list of 300...

[11:13] <jmerelo> So it's even worse...

[11:14] <Altai-man_> I do agree with you the cache should not matter.

[11:14] <Altai-man_> But there is an actual problem with modules from git/hub anyway, as it is hard to say how are they versioned at all.

[11:15] <jmerelo> Altai-man_: they just look at the version in META6.json, not at the real code that's there...

[16:25] <tellable6> 2020-05-27T16:14:28Z #raku <melezhik> AlexDaniel` looks like Blin and Rakudist "fights" for resources right now. I can show you a top stat in PM

[16:27] <melezhik> AlexDaniel` I sent you top stat by email, copied rba,  right now it mostly Blin that gain resources (CPU), rakudist only runs 1 job

[16:27] <AlexDaniel`> melezhik: it's possible there are some runaway processes. Just kill them maybe

[16:27] *** sena_kun joined
[16:28] <AlexDaniel`> there's not much I can do about it, I don't think I even have access to any of that

[16:28] <melezhik> I doubt that RaliDist has runaway processes, I am just trying to say that now Blin and RkDist shares the same VM and it could be a performance issue 

[16:28] <melezhik> when they run in the same time

[16:28] <AlexDaniel`> you can ask Altai-man if they're currently running blin or not

[16:29] <melezhik> but probably there nothing to worried about as long as RkD is not that popular ))))

[16:29] <jnthn> suman: Probably that something sent SIGKILL to it; maybe some OOM killer?

[16:29] *** Altai-man_ left
[16:30] <AlexDaniel`> melezhik: you can try running it with a different nice level if you really need to

[16:30] <AlexDaniel`> but if blin is not running right now and there are still some processes around, then just kill them. Some modules just don't die

[16:31] *** hyperak left
[16:31] <AlexDaniel`> and IIRC blin doesn't kill process trees correctly, or whatever

[16:31] *** hyperak joined
[16:31] <melezhik> AlexDaniel` yeah, but it the end of the day we need to think how to separate resources so that we don't step on each other 

[16:31] *** dakkar left
[16:32] <melezhik> AlexDaniel` I just updated gist now, the only processes from RkD right now - 3 processes that represents 2 web application and Sparky daemon 

[16:32] <melezhik> that is it

[16:33] <melezhik> no active jobs are seen right now on https://rakudist.raku.org/sparky/builds

[16:33] <melezhik> and blin is running right now

[16:33] <melezhik> ps uax | grep blin| wc -l

[16:33] <melezhik> 40

[16:34] <AlexDaniel`> well, blin usually saturates the CPU when it's running

[16:34] <AlexDaniel`> but somehow I doubt that it is running now

[16:35] <melezhik> ps uax | grep blin|grep moar|wc -l

[16:35] <melezhik> 29

[16:35] <AlexDaniel`> and either way there's nothing I can do about any of this

[16:35] <melezhik> well I am not complaining , it's just an observation ...

[16:35] <melezhik> like said as long as people don't start using RkD actively 

[16:36] <melezhik>  ps uax | grep blin|grep zef|wc -l

[16:36] <melezhik> 26

[16:36] <melezhik> 26 zef process run by blin

[16:37] <AlexDaniel`> btw I can't see much in that top output

[16:37] <AlexDaniel`> normally you'll see the actual commands that are running at the end of the line

[16:38] <AlexDaniel`> so if these are runaway processes then we can probably do something about the modules that cause them

[16:40] <melezhik> because by default top truncate commands shown

[16:40] <AlexDaniel`> if the TIME section is wallclock time, then Blin was running for more than two days?

[16:42] <melezhik> AlexDaniel` I just added full commands from blin to the gist  

[16:42] <jdv79> [Coke]:  theres already a ticket - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3073

[16:43] <AlexDaniel`> oh, okay, it's actually running it seems

[16:44] <melezhik> yeah

[16:58] <melezhik> AlexDaniel` btw I can see few zomby processes generated by blin, updated in gist

[16:59] <suman> jnthn timotimo Here is where I get that "Killed". https://repl.it/repls/FruitfulNervousReentrant

[17:00] <melezhik> I won't be able to do this for 2 reasons

[17:00] <melezhik> they are zomby and usually get released after reboot

[19:49] <Manifest0> Isn't a token with '<:alnum+[\-]>+' the same as one with '<:alpha+[\-\d]>+'?

[20:03] <[Coke]> at first glance, yes; what string is matching differently?

[20:06] <MasterDuke> i don't think \d inside a character class means the same as outside, it just means 'd'

[20:13] <jdv79> timotimo: idk about universally.

[20:13] <jdv79> iirc starman does 0.0.0.0 by default...

[20:14] <Manifest0> [Coke]: for example this one: "X-Signature-v2"

[20:49] <[Coke]> for me the alpha one matches, but alnum does not.

[20:54] <[Coke]> m: dd "X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <:alnum>+ /  , "X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <:alpha>+ /

[20:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 986f8ab6b: OUTPUT: «Nil␤Match.new(:orig("X-Signature-v2"), :from(0), :pos(1))␤»

[20:54] <[Coke]> m: dd ~("X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <:alnum>+ /), ~("X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <:alpha>+ /)

[20:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 986f8ab6b: OUTPUT: «Use of Nil in string context␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤""␤"X"␤»

[20:55] <[Coke]> I would expect both of those to return "X"

[20:56] <MasterDuke> i think there's a confusion between pre-defined character classes, e.g., `<alpha>` and `<alnum>`, unicode properties, e.g., <:Nl>, and enumerated character classes, e.g., `<[abc2..4]>`

[20:57] <MasterDuke> unicode properties can be added/subtracted, e.g., `<:Nl + :P>`

[20:58] <MasterDuke> and with enumerated char classes, e.g., `<[\d] - [13579]>`

[21:02] <MasterDuke> some of the unicode properties have long names, but not all

[21:05] <MasterDuke> "The predefined character classes [...] are implemented as built-in named regexes."

[21:07] <[Coke]> m: dd ~("X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <alnum>+ /), ~("X-Signature-v2" ~~ / <alpha>+ /)

[21:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 986f8ab6b: OUTPUT: «"X"␤"X"␤»

[21:11] *** brtastic left
[21:14] <Manifest0> [Coke]: Correct. Only the alpha one works.

[21:15] <Manifest0> MasterDuke: So, none of them should work?

[21:18] <MasterDuke> well, the alpha works because that's a long name, seems like an alias for <:L>

[21:37] <[Coke]> *my* mistake was expecting the : syntax to work everywhere

[21:47] *** Dwarf joined
[21:49] <Dwarf> I'm reading https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial#The_technical_overview and the following part isn't clear to me: "Rule methods are the same as token methods except whitespace is not ignored." -- if it's not ignored, why are things space delimited in a rule?

[21:51] *** soursBot left
[21:55] <jnthn> Dwarf: "not ignored" means "are treated as syntax" rather than "matched literally"; they actually insert a <.ws>

[21:55] <jnthn> (look up sigspace for details)

[21:55] <jnthn> They save you writing explicit calls to a whitespace token all over the place

[21:56] <Dwarf> Ah, are the docs open source? When I've got some time I'll gladly update the docs to make that more clear

[21:57] <jnthn> Yes

[21:57] <Dwarf> Awesome, thank you.

[21:57] <jnthn> I *think* a docs page has a link to its source at the bottom

[22:22] <thundergnat> NativeCall Cstruct pass-by-value angst: https://github.com/thundergnat/SDL2-ttf/blob/master/struct-by-value.md

[22:26] <timotimo> ah yeah sdl2-ttf

[22:26] <timotimo> that's where i despaired as well

[22:26] <thundergnat> Ah. well at least I'm not alone...

[22:27] *** Altai-man_ joined
[22:27] <timotimo> but i suspect sdl2-ttf could actually be small enough to reimplement in raku

[22:28] <thundergnat> Quite possibly (even likely) but it maker a nice small test library for someone interested in implementing pass-by-value

[22:28] <thundergnat> *makes

[22:29] <timotimo> also true, though it may not be very easy to test if the result is correct

[22:29] <timotimo> and i guess you'll also want to test passing two, three, four, five structs by value?

[22:29] *** sena_kun left
[22:30] <thundergnat> Honestly, it seems pretty rare that _large_ structs are passed by value.

[22:31] *** chloekek_ left
[22:33] <thundergnat> I could even forsee needing to pass in some kind of "format" to the Struct builder so it knows exactly what the layout will be without it needing to puzzle it out.

[22:34] <discoD> This is my interpretation of an MVM bytecode parser. It's not worth adding to the ecosystem, but some might find it interesting. https://github.com/ddlws/MVMbc

[22:34] <discoD> couldn't you just cheat and pack the bytes into an int?
