[02:45] <titsuki> Does anyone know how to solve this error?: https://travis-ci.org/titsuki/raku-Algorithm-LDA/jobs/648070169

[02:45] <titsuki> I couldn't reproduce this error on my local environment.

[18:11] <hythm> any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this issue? https://github.com/hythm7/Pakku/issues/6  

[18:13] <[Coke]> hythm: side note, you use an external module, should probably include it in the depends section in META6.json

[18:14] <[Coke]> (makes it easier for folks trying to test out the repo, then then can eaisly install all the deps with `zef install --deps-only .`

[18:16] <rypervenche> Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? My grammar looks to create a parse tree correctly, however it only puts Any into the array, it seems: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/2a42fbff2f355313059ea7df93369d08

[18:24] <lizmat> weekly: https://fluca1978.github.io/2020/02/10/PerlWeeklyChallenge47.html

[18:24] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[18:26] <[Coke]> I find it interesting that the installer has so many module deps.

[18:27] <hythm> [Coke] true, many modules i tried commenting all modules and add one by one, but could not spot a pattern to understand what is the problem

[18:27] *** hacktor joined
[18:28] *** [Sno] joined
[18:29] <hythm> i ts better to have an installer without dependencies at alll, but i think making use of all the good things in the ecosystem and easily extend the module in the future outweighs the cons of depes, especially it can all be fat packed together later
