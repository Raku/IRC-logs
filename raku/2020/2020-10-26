[14:07] <bioexpress> Hello, `choose-multi` from `Term::Choose` returns the chosen elements as an Array. Is that OK or should it return the chosen elements as a List?

[14:08] <lizmat> do you want the returned array to be mutable ?

[14:21] <bioexpress> lizmat, what does that mean?

[14:21] <lizmat> should you be able to change the values in the array that is returned, or should they be considered constants

[14:23] <bioexpress> I am not shure.

[14:26] <moritz> IME it doesn't usually make much of a difference

[14:27] *** skids left
[14:27] <bioexpress> Maybe it is the best to keep it as it is (Array), so I don't have to break backwards compatibily.

[14:27] <tyil> lizmat++

[14:27] <Altreus> I would say the calling code takes ownership of the response, and therefore it is fine for it to be mutable

[14:27] <Altreus> I can imagine a situation where a substitution would be applied over the results, for instance

[14:28] *** epony left
[14:29] <lizmat> Altreus: this doesn't matter in anything like: my @a = Term::Choose.choos-multi

[14:30] <lizmat> it would only make a difference in something like: for Term::Choose.choose-multi { $_ = 42 }

[14:30] <lizmat> and that would be rare, I think

[14:33] <Altreus> well when the choices are "break" or "do nothing"...

[14:34] <lizmat> well, I would vote for break in this case, as apparently the user has a wrong idea of what is going on there

[14:37] <Altreus> agreed

[14:38] <Altreus> feels like some kind of sink context to me

[14:38] <Altreus> although the array itself isn't sunk ... nothing is being done

[14:39] <Altreus> Can you make an array that's immutable unless it's put somewhere? :/

[14:39] <lizmat> but if it's put somewhere, it does not need to be mutable ?

[14:41] <Altreus> I mean if I do my @a = Term::Choose.choose-multi, then I want @a to be mutable

[14:41] <Altreus> rather, its items

[14:41] <Altreus> Because if I do the for example, I want it not to be, since mutating it will have no effect

[14:41] <lizmat> yeah, but in that case it doesn't matter whether it returns an Array or a List

[14:41] <Altreus> oh, yes that's the difference

[14:41] <Altreus> I lost sight of that :D

[14:41] <Altreus> I got stuck on mutable vs immutable array

[16:29] <[Coke]> mmm. could do that if I really want the <> syntax, thank you

[16:30] <thundergnat> I was iterating through arrays of Ranges and had to special case for arrays with only one element because of single arg. Not a problem once I figured it out, but very surprising initially.
