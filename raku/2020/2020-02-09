[19:08] *** aborazmeh left
[19:09] <farcas82regreg> does raku have the best "leverage" for complex logic?

[19:17] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:23] <moritz_> farcas82regreg: it's pretty good for complex domains

[19:23] <moritz_> though for symbolic computations, something like Mathematica is better suited (but also fairly expensive)

[19:24] <farcas82regreg> i need something i can embedd in my windows application

[19:25] *** jmerelo joined
[19:25] <farcas82regreg> so mathematica is not suitable (beside being too costly)

[19:25] <farcas82regreg> can i redistribute raku binaries?

[19:26] <jmerelo> farcas82regreg: raku is free software

[19:27] <jmerelo> farcas82regreg: you can download it all you want, print CDs, print out the binary on a book, whatever you want. Free as in free speech, free as in free beer

[19:38] <moritz_> sounds interesting

[19:39] <farcas82regreg> does raku have goto?

[19:41] <lizmat> LEAVE is for a scope

[19:41] <farcas82regreg> right

[19:41] <moritz_> LEAVE is scope, END is is program. Objects can also have a DESTROY method that's (non-deterministcally) called during GC

[21:22] <rypervenche> If I wanted to write a grammar this, how might I write the TOP token? I'm looking for something like "INCOMING=8885551234" or "OUTGOING=8885551234" on a line. Only one will be on each line and not every line will have one. I'm not sure how to slurp in a file and then have the grammar be able to find just that on each line, if it exists, then go to the next line and check that, etc.

[21:58] <rypervenche> I'm basically taking a log file and looking for those specific bits of texts, that I then want to manipulate later with actions. But I'm not sure how to get them out the lines in a grammar, or if it's even possible.

[22:02] *** xelxebar left
[22:02] <lizmat> feels like a line-based source of data should have a line-based solution ?

[22:04] <rypervenche> Ah, would a grammar not be the proper solution for this?

[22:04] *** lucasb left
[22:05] <rypervenche> I'm not sure if you saw the previous lines about INCOMING and OUTGOING related to this.

[22:06] <lizmat> rypervenche: yeah I did

[22:06] <lizmat> do you have a (small) example source ?

[22:06] <lizmat> that you could gist ?

[22:09] *** xelxebar joined
[22:09] <rypervenche> Yeah, let me get one.

[22:11] *** dominix joined
[22:13] <dominix> could someone remind me how to display a complete output of (big list).say

[22:13] <dominix> because ....say display just few dozen of result

[22:14] <dominix> it's frustrating

[22:14] <rypervenche> lizmat: While I could write something that would match the lines I need perfectly, I can't be sure that they will always show up this way, which is why I'd like to use something more generic, if possible: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/2a42fbff2f355313059ea7df93369d08

[22:16] <dominix> raku -e '((1..1000).grep: *.is-prime).say'   --> its just display 3 lines

[22:17] <dominix> how do I have the complete output ?

[22:21] <stoned75> :q

[22:22] <lizmat> dominix: say calls .gist on the result, which limits to 100 results

[22:22] *** melezhik left
[22:22] <lizmat> .say for (1..1000).grep: *.is-prime

[22:22] <lizmat> should give you all

[22:25] <dominix> it is horrific ... why should a command decide for me what to display ???

[22:25] <dominix> when I want to "say" what in it , I am willing a "complete" reply not a partial one ... 

[22:26] <moritz_> then do a .join(', ') or so

[22:27] <moritz_> with infinite lists, you don't want .say to hang, generally, which is why it does something safer by default

[22:28] *** rindolf left
[22:28] <dominix> my list is not infinite ...

[22:29] <dominix> and thank you to give me this tips, but it is basically diferent. say happen brace ( ... ) and there is not brace with .join()

[22:30] <dominix> p6:((1..1000).grep: *.is-prime).say

[22:30] <dominix> m:((1..1000).grep: *.is-prime).say

[22:31] <dominix> is say the same as .gist.put ?

[22:43] <lizmat> indeed
