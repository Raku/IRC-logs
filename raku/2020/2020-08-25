[00:13] *** aaaaaaaaa joined
[00:14] <aaaaaaaaa> I'm going through one of the raku books and I"m getting this error. https://hastebin.com/usozidojup.rb

[00:14] <aaaaaaaaa> Seems like has to do with the REPL interpreter, works fine if I save it to file and run it.

[00:15] <aaaaaaaaa> I'd paste the error but its like 10 lines.

[00:18] <[Coke]> works here.

[00:18] <[Coke]> what version of rakudo are you running? what platform? had you already put a P in that instance of the REPL?

[00:19] <aaaaaaaaa> rakudo-0.2020.02-1.fc32.x86_64. Fedora 32. Nope that's the first class I created in this session.

[00:21] <[Coke]> This is Rakudo version 2020.07-54-gd4bac47ff built on MoarVM version 2020.07

[00:21] <[Coke]> So maybe a bug that's been fixed in the intervening time

[00:24] <aaaaaaaaa> https://stackoverflow.com/a/53905191

[00:24] <aaaaaaaaa> Yeah looks like bug having to do with multi-line logic.

[00:25] <aaaaaaaaa> Worked fine if I kept it all in one line. Thanks for looking.

[22:42] <sena_kun> codesections, yes. Well, technically you can workaround just about everything using MOP, etc, but testing private things instead of public API sounds so bad I don't even know what to suggest.

[22:45] <sena_kun> Providing API which is backed by private code and then covering it, hence covering private code as well, is the way Raku offers to test private/non-exported methods and subs.
