[10:08] *** rindolf left

[10:15] <AlexDaniel> robertle: no, you don't need to tweak META.list if you're releasing on CPAN

[10:43] <mahafyi> Note: It is discouraged to change the system Perl interpreter and libraries.Lot of Debian and GNU tools, use Perl. Lot of system core components, packaging internals and other critical points, rely on Perl versions.

[10:44] <mahafyi> So I guess I have to go to debian 10 now. stayed on 9 due to some other issues in buster ...

[10:44] <mahafyi> thats wrt to my earlier on upgrading perl to install Inline::Perl5

[10:49] <lizmat> you can install your own Perl on a system and use that, no ?

[10:49] <lizmat> no need to upgrade any system perl?

[10:52] <AlexDaniel> it's easier to install an older version of Inline::Perl5

[10:53] *** mowcat joined
[10:53] <mahafyi> AlexDaniel : Can you help with the syntax to do that?

[10:54] <mahafyi> do you mean i should use an older Rakudo star?

[11:16] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: please reopen that bug report then

[11:16] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: you can work around it by using $foo instead of @foo

[11:16] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I did that

[11:16] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: just like I did in Blin, but then you'd have other problems

[11:17] <El_Che> but it's hairy

[11:17] <El_Che> idea was: --env="FOO=bar" --env="BAR=baz""

[11:18] <El_Che> that will have less cornercases than --env=""FOO=bar,BAR=baz"

[11:18] <El_Che> --env="FOO=bar,BAR=baz"

[11:18] <El_Che> but good enough

[11:18] <El_Che> I'll reopen the issue

[11:20] <El_Che> I can't reopen it (no rights), can someone reopen it? i'll add a comment

[11:21] <lizmat> El_Che: which one?

[11:22] <AlexDaniel> how come you don't have rights

[11:22] * AlexDaniel fixes

[11:22] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: invitation sent

[11:23] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2797

[11:32] <El_Che> AlexDaniel, lizmat: thanks. Added a note just stating it's still there with the latest release.

[11:42] <lizmat> committable6: 2020.02.1 BEGIN @*ARGS="--foo=42"; sub MAIN(:@foo) { say @foo }

[11:42] <committable6> lizmat, ¦2020.02.1: «[42]␤»

[11:42] <lizmat> El_Che: I cannot reproduce

[11:42] <timotimo> committable6: 2020.02.1 BEGIN @*ARGS="--foo=42"; multi MAIN(:@foo) { say @foo }

[11:42] <committable6> timotimo, ¦2020.02.1: «[42]␤»

[11:46] <El_Che> mm

[11:46] <El_Che> let me get the gist

[11:48] <El_Che> I can reproduce it, let me strip it to the minimum

[11:52] <El_Che> committable6: 2020.02.1 BEGIN @*ARGS="--name=n --foo=42"; sub MAIN(Str :$name!, :@foo) { say @foo }

[11:52] <committable6> El_Che, ¦2020.02.1: «[]␤»

[11:52] <El_Che> committable6: 2020.02.1 BEGIN @*ARGS="--name=n --foo=42 --foo=43"; sub MAIN(Str :$name!, :@foo) { say @foo }

[11:52] <committable6> El_Che, ¦2020.02.1: «[]␤»

[11:52] <El_Che> mm

[11:53] <lizmat> please note that the fix of allowing a single --foo to arrive in :@foo, is a failed dispatch

[11:54] <lizmat> since the dispatch did not fail in the --name case, you won't see the @foo seeing populated

[11:54] <lizmat> the only way to (currently, at least) get around that, is you add a candidate that takes a :$foo as well

[11:55] <lizmat> technically a :$foo! probably

[11:55] *** sjm_uk left
[11:57] <El_Che> go a test

[11:57] <El_Che> and it's the typecheck

[11:57] <El_Che> $ echo 'sub MAIN(Str :$name!, :@foo) { say @foo }' > test.raku; chmod +x test.raku ; raku test.raku -name=n --foo=1 --foo=2; raku test.raku --name=n --foo=1

[11:57] <El_Che> that works as expected

[11:57] <El_Che> sorry

[11:57] *** robertle joined
[11:57] <El_Che> that's the one that breaks

[11:57] <El_Che> without the Str typecheck it passes

[11:58] <robertle> AlexDaniel: so should I remove my modules from META.list if they are also on CPAN? Will they get discovered automatically?

[11:58] <tellable6> 2020-05-03T10:15:05Z #raku <AlexDaniel> robertle: no, you don't need to tweak META.list if you're releasing on CPAN

[11:59] <lizmat> robertle: if you upload to PAUSE, it will get discovered

[11:59] <AlexDaniel> robertle: yeah, what lizmat said, it takes some time though

[12:00] <AlexDaniel> like, is it twice per day or so?

[12:00] <lizmat> well, I thought max 4 hours or so, but could also be 2x a day

[12:00] <lizmat> in any case, that's only needed for the initial discovery

[12:00] <robertle> ok, understood. currently they are uploaded to PAUSE *and* the github links are in the META.list, should I remove the latter? for cleanlyness?

[12:01] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[12:01] <robertle> ok

[12:01] <El_Che> lizmat: updated the issue with an expanded example on when it breaks

[12:02] <El_Che> (I need to reread your remark above to see if it's related)

[12:02] * lizmat was doing the same  :-)

[12:02] <El_Che> (that the trigger is the type of another parameters would suggest it's not)

[12:03] <El_Che> -s

[12:04] <lizmat> noted, but am a bit reluctant to fix this just before the release

[12:04] *** holyghost left
[12:05] <El_Che> it's not a regression, do it afterwards

[12:05] <lizmat> m: BEGIN @*ARGS = <--name=n --foo-1>; multi MAIN(Str :$name!) { }   # further golf, you don't need the named in the signature

[12:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6bb87106e: OUTPUT: «Usage:␤  <tmp> --name=<Str>␤»

[12:05] <AlexDaniel> uhhh is master locked or something? I just pushed a change…

[16:34] *** clarjon1 joined
[16:37] <mahafyi> i am parsing a security log file in order to ban offending IP addresses. I feel very awkward to paste here, but i'd like to learn how to write better. I am re-starting to learn programming with perl6 after long months ..https://pastebin.com/QfSK57sc

[16:39] <mahafyi> so my problem is : i am essentially creating a List with split several times, in order to get the string I want. There should be an elegant way to put in a hash?

[16:41] <guifa2> Depending on what you're splitting on, perhaps using a regex/grammar (particularly if each split's elements are being split, and so forth)

[16:43] <mahafyi> there is bunch of KV in there, i could not get it into a hash , was getting various errors. i have to get each pair individually like this. It is ok for now, as all i want to do really is shell "iptables ban the IP"

[16:44] *** salimsimba left
[16:44] <MasterDuke> mahafyi: fwiw, you can split with just a string, which is faster (i don't know exactly how much so). e.g., "a,csv,row".split(",")

[16:46] <mahafyi> i am doing that only , it bocmes a Seq (not a Str anymore), then I split the particular element (i manually counted it lol) to get the IP address

[16:46] <mahafyi> as i said, its working ok... just felt its somehow wrongly done..not sure.

[16:46] <MasterDuke> i mean .split("str") instead of .split(/"str"/)

[16:47] <mahafyi> MasterDuke , oh.. ok i will see what the difference is

[16:48] <guifa2> .split(",")[3] is fairly idiomatic if not super self-documenting

[16:49] <MasterDuke> in a trivial benchmark splitting with a str instead of a regex takes 1/4 the time

[16:49] <mahafyi> ah ok
