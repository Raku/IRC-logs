[13:23] <nwc10> thanks. Lets see if I can get emojis now.

[13:23] <nwc10> I blame the Unicode consortium :-)

[13:24] <nwc10> inconsistent URLs (.../latest/... has to be unpicked differently to get 12.1.0 of UCD and 12.1.0 of UCA instead of 13 of both. Silly ftp server that must have changed as I assume samcv's script used to work, etc)

[13:27] <nwc10> because they put it somewhere else.

[17:33] <Altai-man_> rbt, we don't need a point release? :)

[17:35] <rbt> No. I think I got a quirky OpenSSL update from Ubuntu.

[17:35] <rbt> Basically, the module ignore warnings while setting up the socket but not while tearing it down.

[17:36] <rbt> So a promise was not getting kept (or broken).

[17:36] <rbt> Same error with 2020.02.01

[19:22] <El_Che> I have a failure building a relocabable rakudo that I didn't have with previous releases: https://gist.github.com/nxadm/385dc568b7cdd88a9cb7fbebc89fb875#file-rakudo-fail-L5532

[19:22] <El_Che> the relocatable releases are done on the oldest supported linux distros

[19:23] <El_Che> in this cases x64 is done on centos6

[19:23] <El_Che> does it ring a bell?

[19:23] <El_Che> it looks like the new code makes some compiler assumptions it didn't before

[19:27] <patrickb> El_Che did you see the conversation on #raku-dev?

[19:27] <patrickb> It boils down to this: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1318

[19:28] <patrickb> For the precomp builds on rakudo.org I just patched the file.

[19:28] <El_Che> I see

[19:28] *** kensanata joined
[19:30] <El_Che> Can i work around by export env vaiables or is patching the only way to go?

[19:33] <patrickb> El_Che: I can't promise, but I think patching is the only way to go. You need to make gcc do other stuff. Can't do that with env vars or some such...

[19:34] <El_Che> thx

[19:36] <sena_kun> Please patch. I suspect most of the people with such old glibc use binaries and if you are compiling on something like centos, you can as well drop here and ask. I am also wondering if we can make our CI to check such cases.

[19:36] <tellable6> 2020-06-21T18:33:39Z #raku-dev <patrickb> sena_kun: Precomp builds are done and uploaded.

[19:37] <sena_kun> One thing I am sure of is we won't do points every month, it is more robust to fix infrastructure which allowed that to happen and move forward in 27 days.

[19:41] <guifa> Naming preference question

[19:41] <guifa> In CLDR, there are two data points in the exemplar characters set.  ‚Äústandard‚Äù and ‚Äúauxiliary‚Äù

[19:42] <guifa> For English, standard is A-Z, but auxiliar includes accented characters that are commonly encountered but not strictly English

[19:42] <guifa> I‚Äôve made a token called <local-alpha> but I‚Äôm not sure the best way to call standard, versus standard+auxiliarly

[19:44] <guifa> I‚Äôve thought about :strict (to limit to standard) or :broad / :lax (to open it up to auxiliary), but I‚Äôm not really liking those names, nor am I convinced which one should be the default mode.  ANy thoughts?

[19:44] <El_Che> I will move my relocatable builds to ubuntu 14.04, released on the same year as centos 6

[19:44] <El_Che> still supported

[20:28] <El_Che> of

[20:29] <El_Che> 20.04 is a greate release

[20:29] <El_Che> as 19.10 was as well

[20:29] <patrickb> El_Che: Ubuntu 14.04 has glibc 2.19. Such builds will break on: CentOS/RHEL 6 and 7.

[20:29] <El_Che> the best in years

[20:31] <El_Che> yeah, ubuntu is betting hard on snaps

[20:31] <El_Che> I don't use it, except a few they installed for gnome

[20:50] <El_Che> sena_kun: if you're talking about packagers, I get your point. If you're talking about regular users compiling the release, then no dot release is less than ideal

[20:50] *** aborazmeh left
[20:55] *** Altai-man_ joined
[20:56] <Altai-man_> El_Che, I do agree it is LTA. But I also think about how many regular users have distros from 2011 which _insist_ on compiling instead of just using a package in this particular environment. If anyone wants to do a point release, I won't object.

[20:57] *** sena_kun left
[20:58] <El_Che> Altai-man_: I certainly agree about using binaries (no surprises there :) ), I just think source has the "official status" and expectations if you know what I mean

[21:01] *** rindolf left
[21:06] <Altai-man_> I may be reacting worse than usual right now because of the hell of last couple of weeks and stuff. While I do agree with statement the releases should have enough quality, yet this will be a third in a row failed release which needed a point, so much quality (nope). Maybe I am not just qualified enough to do this properly.

[21:07] <lizmat> Altai-man_: you had all of the green lights you could expect, so please don't blame this on yourself

[21:07] <El_Che> Altai-man_: I don't see it as you not being qualified. The thought didn't cross my mind

[21:08] <lizmat> we need more lights that can go red if we want to prevent this sort of thing in the future

[21:08] <Altai-man_> lizmat, that's why I am saying about "make a visible clear test for such cases first" every time.

[21:08] <lizmat> Altai-man_: it's the same when I'm refactoring core stuff: if all tests pass, and blin his happy, and someone finds an issue after that

[21:09] <patrickb> Altai-man: I'd vote for no point release this time. The chance for someone stumbling over this are quite slim.

[21:10] <El_Che> Altai-man_: there is a long story of dot releases, and I don't think anyone thought of blaming AlexDaniel` or Zoffix. The other way round actually. A dot release is a lot of extra work.

[21:11] <AlexDaniel`> so what happened? What's the bug in the release?

[21:11] <AlexDaniel`> I'm starting to backlog now, but maybe there's a TL;DR

[21:12] <El_Che> An option is to amend the release notes?

[21:12] <El_Che> "Make fails on older compiler" https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1309

[21:13] *** soursBot left

[21:16] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel`, to compiler from sources using gcc in centos 6 you need to add a parameter by hands / patch code by hands. Can just use binaries which presumably will be patched.

[21:16] <Altai-man_> s/compiler/compile/

[21:16] <El_Che> and 7, I just saw

[21:17] <AlexDaniel`> I wouldn't call it ancient‚Ä¶ that's like 2014-2015?

[21:18] <patrickb> Datapoint: The build was broken for years until I fixed building on older GCCs some months ago. Nobody had noticed before.

[21:18] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: if I were you I'd give it a day or two, then decide

[21:18] <AlexDaniel`> maybe more issues will pop up and it'll make the decision easier

[21:18] <AlexDaniel`> or more bug reports

[21:18] <AlexDaniel`> about the same issue

[21:18] <Altai-man_> Let me just ask quickly... Applying a patch, archiving it as 2020.06 and replacing on the server is the most horrible idea I could thought of, right?

[21:18] <AlexDaniel`> patrickb: oh. Hmm

[21:19] <AlexDaniel`> or if it remains quiet then no need to do anything

[21:19] <patrickb> The only reason this came up so quickly now is that the precomp system El_Che and I are using both build on CentOS 6.

[21:19] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: yes, pretty horrible?

[21:19] <Altai-man_> Ok, forget that.

[21:19] <AlexDaniel`> you wonderful people :)

[21:19] <patrickb> s/precomp system/infrastructure for creating the precompiled binaries/

[21:20] <AlexDaniel`> I have a question though, why haven't you noticed it before the release?

[21:20] <AlexDaniel`> honestly, fixing that is perhaps more important than fixing the release

[21:21] <lizmat> .oO( we need more lights that can go red )

[21:21] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel`, we use newer envs for all the checks and then after making a release binaries are created.

[21:21] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Testing does not use ancient OSes. Only the infra for creating the pre built binaries.

[21:21] <AlexDaniel`> the release won't matter in a month, but being able to know that the release is not breaking for older compilers is an everlasting beauty

[21:22] <AlexDaniel`> yeah but can't we make like nightly binaries?

[21:22] <patrickb> So the idea would be to muddle in a test on CentOS 6 into the MoarVM tests?

[21:23] <AlexDaniel`> yeah, that's one way

[21:23] <Altai-man_> Either this or move binaries creation earlier in the pipeline.

[21:23] <AlexDaniel`> but as long as something is running before the release it'll be much better than the current situation

[21:24] <Altai-man_> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros <- azure provides centos 6, 7, 8.

[21:25] <Altai-man_> Can't we extend out current setup to use it to create artifacts?

[21:26] <patrickb> Altai-man: That's what already happens.

[21:26] <patrickb> The precomp releases I create use the azure pipeline of rakudo

[21:26] <patrickb> It has two stages: Test  and Build_Precomp_Release

[21:27] <patrickb> Currently a flag triggers which of the two should be run.

[21:27] <Altai-man_> patrickb, are you missing something out? Why wasn't the bug detected then?

[21:28] <patrickb> The precomp build stage is currently hidden behind a flag. It's not run by default.

[21:28] <Altai-man_> patrickb, a-anything preventing us from enabling it?

[21:32] *** gordonfish left
[21:37] <Altai-man_> patrickb, doesn't "The build was broken for years until I fixed building on older GCCs some months ago" contradict with "I have been building Raku on Centos 6 since 2015" in the ticket?

[21:38] <Altai-man_> Oh, they are referring to two different bugs.

[21:42] *** mowcat left
[21:43] <patrickb> let me find that commit...

[21:47] <patrickb> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/23c16b303163c621858365dbf56eb <- That's the one. Could be it was CentOS 4 or 5 at that time.

[21:48] <patrickb> Enabling the precomp build stage is not entirely trivial. It builds based on the final release source archive that it downloads.

[21:48] <patrickb> Such archives are not available for every commit.

[21:48] <Altai-man_> I see.

[21:52] <patrickb> It might be possible to make it work for every commit by implementing a switch to either use a release source archive or a checkout. But then the build won't be exactly the same.

[21:53] <Altai-man_> Ok, so I'm going afk for now, then $dayjob. Will think about if we need a point.

[21:53] <patrickb> o/

[21:54] <Altai-man_> patrickb, never mind the nightly then, I guess just tweaking the setup to have explicit checks for this case is enough.
