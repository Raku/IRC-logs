[00:25] <takside> heya, i'm trying to extend the OpenSSL module to support client certs, but this requires passing a raku function as a parameter to a C func as a callback. Does anybody have a solid example of this I can examine?

[14:21] <xinming> SmokeMachine: What is the right way to turn a ResultSeq a normal Seq where the value will be flated into objects?

[14:22] <SmokeMachine> .Seq

[14:22] <xinming> When I try something like   `$rs-seq.map(*.xx).raku.say;`, It'll reports warning,

[16:38] <ingy> greetings

[16:39] <ingy> some months ago I converted the yaml 1.2 spec grammar https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html to yaml https://github.com/yaml/yaml-grammar/blob/master/yaml-spec-1.2.yaml

[16:41] <ingy> then I worked on _generating_ parsers (in multiple languages including perl) from that spec yaml https://github.com/yaml/yaml-reference-parser

[16:41] <ingy> the result is parsers that pass 100% of the yaml test suite: https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite

[16:42] <ingy> I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing a raku port

[16:46] <stoned75> eh sounds like fun :)

[16:49] <SmokeMachine> xinming: Model.bb.create: ...

[16:50] <ingy> I'll start a branch later today and let you guys know. it should be pretty easy to do.

[16:50] <SmokeMachine> xinming: sorry, `$obj.bb.create: ...`

[16:50] <ingy> stoned75: yeah, and really not hard to do.

[16:59] <lizmat> ingy: OOC, if "it should be pretty easy to do.", then what is stopping *you* from doing it ?

[17:01] <ingy> lizmat: the myriad tasks of moving the entire YAML language forward :D

[17:02] <ingy> also, I certainly could but that would be hoarding all the fun...

[17:02] *** MilkmanDan left
[17:04] <ingy> I was talking about it on #toolchain with leont, who would be perfect but didn't have the tuits, and "mst | ingy: announce it in #raku over on freenode and it's entirely possible you'll get takers"

[17:04] <ingy> so I did :)

[17:04] <lizmat> we don't mind hoarders in that respect, we love to see people having fun  :-)

[17:05] <lizmat> sadly DrForr might have taken this on, but he's no longer with us  :-(

[17:05] <ingy> it's my understanding that raku still needs a capable yaml parser…

[17:05] *** jast left
[17:05] <ingy> no longer with us as in????

[17:06] <ingy> I hope he's still alive

[17:07] <leont> He isn't. 2020…

[17:07] <ingy> we used to be next door neighbors in 2002.

[17:07] <ingy> oh shit

[17:08] <ingy> :'(

[17:09] <ingy> the yaml port doesn't involve any knowledge of parsing or even raku-rules. it's just a port of ~1000 lines of perl

[17:11] <ingy> the first version was done in the most basic (and slow) way possible; so that it could easily port anywhere.

[17:12] <ingy> I didn't even know if it was possible or if the grammar was correct. and I honestly don't fully know how it all works :)

[17:12] <ingy> I just kept addressing each failing test from the suite until they all passed

[17:13] <ingy> down the road I will generate more optimized parsers

[17:13] <ingy> and also a better grammar structure
