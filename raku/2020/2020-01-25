[00:01] <Ven_de_Thiel> yeah, a few.

[00:01] <Ven_de_Thiel> I just made some things be IIFEs for ease of compilation at first

[00:03] <Ven_de_Thiel> still have no idea how do `use`

[00:13] <jnthn> Yeah, that'll be fun...

[00:13] <jnthn> Probably we'll need to somehow mimic the template repository setup to avoid dupe-copying them.

[00:16] <Ven_de_Thiel> it generates *almost-correct* JS :P

[00:17] <Ven_de_Thiel> A lot of things are made much more "fun" by JS not allowing newlines in strings, but I'm considering using `` syntax instead -- so long we don't care too much about which JS version

[00:20] <jnthn> hm, we can't just escape the newlines to \n?

[00:20] <Ven_de_Thiel> that's what I'm doing, but I'm missing some place

[00:20] *** wamba left

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> they may not add raku unless it becomes very popular, but it'd still be nice to have our versions of the programs they have

[07:33] *** Nokko joined
[07:34] <Nokko> o/

[07:34] <AlexDaniel> alialiali: as for in-place editing, there is no such flag yet, so you'd need to do it yourself somehow (e.g. write to a temp file and then move it)

[07:35] <AlexDaniel> Nokko: \o

[07:35] <Nokko> raku time, first install... what to build, what to build.

[07:38] <AlexDaniel> Nokko: maybe try prebuilt packages? :) https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[07:38] <AlexDaniel> or see what your distro has to offer

[07:40] <alialiali> how can I make perl6 save the results back in the same file? (like sed -i or perl -i) something like this: perl6 --output=test -ne '$_ ~= "\n"' test

[07:49] <Nokko> AlexDaniel: My distro's got rakudo-star in Homebrew ( ’û‡®ä’û)

[07:50] <AlexDaniel> alialiali: as I said, there's no -i yet, so you'll have to write to a temp file first

[16:40] <dakkar> hello

[16:40] <dakkar> fun bug:

[16:40] <dakkar> p6: sub thing { return 5 }; sub foo { do { LEAVE thing; return 1 } }; say foo

[16:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´5‚ê§¬ª

[16:41] <dakkar> I'm pretty sure that should say 1

[16:41] <dakkar> mainly because:

[16:41] <dakkar> p6: sub thing { return 5 }; sub foo { LEAVE thing; return 1 }; say foo

[16:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[16:41] <dakkar> LEAVE interacts weirdly with non-Sub blocks?

[16:42] <tyil> DrForr: is there any method whatsoever for those willing to help out at FOSDEM now, or is everyone being forced to use Slack?

[16:42] <tyil> any communication method*

[16:43] <tyil> since I don't see any emails anymore, and I haven't heard of anything thus far

[16:45] <tyil> and, to be honest, requiring proprietary software in order to volunteer for a free software project attending a free software event is very weird (to keep it civil)

[16:57] <wildtrees> what does LEAVE do? 

[16:58] <Voldenet> gets invoked before leaving the block

[16:58] <dakkar> a LEAVE block is run when the execution leaves the surronding block 

[16:59] *** sena_kun joined
[16:59] <dakkar> Voldenet: wow, another wrinkle! I'm now thinking that control exceptions are mixed up in that (IIRC, `return` generates a sort-of exception)

[16:59] <wildtrees> p6: sub thing { say 5 } ; sub foo {do {LEAVE thing ; say 1}} ; foo

[17:41] <Grinnz> tyil: if it helps, slack can be used from the browser without any software, and slack can be used via paid irccloud subscription or https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack as well

[17:42] <Grinnz> (the slack client is pretty bad so i use irccloud for it

[17:42] <tyil> that doesn't make Slack itself any less bad 

[17:43] <Grinnz> i agree, but communities are where they are

[17:43] <tyil> especially considering everyone is already using a free form of communication through email

[17:43] <tyil> and communities doing harmful things that stop volunteers ought to rethink decisions

[18:19] <DrForr> tyil: Re: Slack - It was strictly how Stuart preferred to communicate - I put out an email call for people that had expressed their willingness to do something and got barely any response

[18:20] <sjn> tyil: the TPF slack seems to have been around for a while, but only recently (last half year) been made use of publicly

[18:20] <rypervenche> Perhaps an open source alternative like Zulip would work?

[18:21] <tyil> rypervenche: anything that doesn't make me give up all semblance of privacy and security for literally no feasible gain would work

[18:21] <sjn> personally, I wish TPF would have picked another platform, but as things are now, it's what they have.

[18:22] <tyil> and they can change it whenever they like as well, sjn 

[18:22] <sjn> tyil: and yes there is a LOT of things that should and needs to improve with TPF

[18:22] <tyil> and it's still beyond me how Slack can be chosen as a communication platform for FOSDEM

[18:23] <tyil> I wish I could help out to improve whatever I can

[18:24] <sjn> so in some ways I really appreciate that we have an opportunity to set up a Raku Foundation (like ash and others have mentioned). It would be awesome to be able to shed a lot of the baggage that TPF is bringing along.

[18:25] <sjn> tyil: it's TPF's slack, and since TPF decided to take over the Raku stand from Andrew and make it into a Perl & Raku stand, they also decided to use their existing chat infrastructure

[18:25] <sjn> I don't think it's more complicated than "this is what we have right now"

[18:25] <tadzik> fwiw, Slack can be easily bridged to Matrix and then bridged to anything else, enabling slack people to talk with IRC people on the same channel

[18:25] <tyil> that doesn't make it any more baffling to see a a group pushing for proprietary software to attend a free software event

[18:26] <sjn> and having a comms discussion just a few weeks before fosdem seems a bit misplaced....

[18:26] <tyil> tadzik: then you're still forcing everyone to use yet another thing, just so it can be bridged to a bad solution

[18:26] <DrForr> tyil - I understand. We're only (so far) using it for the organizers (like myself) and a few people that want to listen to decisions being made. I did *NOT* make this choice. I would *PREFER* not to use Slack. But the people that took over the Raku stand from Andrew chose to start using Slack. It's not meant as any sort of snub towards free software, although I can see how it seems that way.

[18:26] <tyil> sjn: nobody replied before, it's not just now that I raise an issue on it

[18:26] <tadzik> tyil: I don't disagree :) Just proposing a patch for a horrible decision

[18:26] <tyil> I don't think giving an inch is going to solve the underlying problem

[18:26] <sjn> tyil: yeah, there's only a few tuits going around too

[18:27] <tyil> from my point of view, it's hypocritical to push for proprietary things to even volunteer at a free software event

[18:28] <tyil> sjn: as I said, I can't help without comprimising on the very morals that make me interested to go to fosdem to begin with

[18:28] <tadzik> I imagine the underlying problem is likely "I'm not a technical person and/or I don't understand the problem with it"

[18:28] <tyil> so in this sense, they're keeping tuits out

[18:28] <tadzik> but also possibly "there's a limited number of hills I want to die on and that's why I also use a Mac"

[18:28] <sjn> tyil: I agree with your point to a certain degree. Weighing against it, is also the consideration for building a community where others already are (and with "others" I mean "people outside our community which we would like to join ours")

[18:28] <tyil> tadzik: plenty of people online are willing to teach to those willing to listen

[18:28] <tadzik> tyil: sure. But I don't think "not giving an inch" is the best way to teach

[18:28] <tyil> sjn: slack doens't apply to that, though

[18:29] <tyil> every slack "server" is yet another gated community

[18:29] <sjn> lots of businesses use slack

[18:29] <tyil> yes

[18:29] <tyil> and those are all not connected to any other slack "server"

[18:29] <tyil> the "community effect" is not a thing for Slack

[18:29] <tyil> it's designed to be that way

[18:29] <sjn> tyil: but when you have one slack login, it's trivial to switch to another server without having to create another login

[18:29] <sjn> so there's that

[18:30] <tyil> it's more trivial to just hit the "reply" button in my mail client

[18:30] <sjn> but sure, I don't disagree :)

[18:30] <tyil> it's more trivial to /join another channel on freenode

[18:30] <tyil> so again, Slack is not a winner in this aspect here either

[18:31] <sjn> What does an ideal Open Source communications stack look like in 2020? That's an interesting question worth exploring a little

[18:31] *** cpan-raku left
[18:31] <tadzik> mozilla went for matrix recently, fortunately

[18:31] <tadzik> (they were considering discord :o)

[18:31] <tyil> "ideal" depends on what kind of communication you want, there's no golden bullet to solve all problems

[18:32] <Grinnz> IRC is still a contender, tbh

[18:32] *** cpan-raku joined
[18:32] *** cpan-raku left
[18:32] *** cpan-raku joined
[18:32] <Grinnz> especially with things like irccloud around

[18:32] <sjn> protocol integration, service automation, A/V support, streaming, chat, bots support, easy access, logging, content searchability, file sharing....

[18:32] <tyil> interesting reading: https://davelane.nz/why-slack-better-and-why-open-communities-shouldnt-use-it

[18:32] <sjn> tyil: yes, today there are no golden (actually, silver) bullets

[18:33] <tyil> sjn: integration, automation, chat, bots, access, logging, searchability, all irc

[18:33] <tadzik> erm, no

[18:33] <tyil> email does those too

[18:33] <tadzik> IRC plus 10 different services you may have set up around it doesn't exactly qualify as "IRC ticks these boxes" imho

[18:33] <sjn> tyil: making a list of features, listing them by desirability and then comparing alternatives? sounds like a blog post :)

[18:34] <Grinnz> IRC only solves these problems due to the ecosystem

[18:34] <tyil> tadzik: you think slack is a single threaded application?

[18:34] <tadzik> tyil: I don't know, I never used slack

[18:34] <tyil> with no external dependencies, or 3rd party services making all those "features" possible

[18:34] <Grinnz> ... it is

[18:34] <tadzik> oh come on now

[18:35] <tadzik> yes, I'm pretty sure slack has logs without you needing to set up a logger bot and a logs website

[18:35] <Grinnz> those features are built into the slack web application

[18:35] <sjn> open protocols make a certain difference in that regard :)

[18:35] <Grinnz> and i can use most of them through their api in irccloud as well

[18:35] <tyil> tadzik: so has literally every irc client Ive ever seen

[18:35] <tadzik> *client*, yes

[18:36] <tyil> and for irc, you can use things like irccloud if you don't want to set anything up

[18:36] <tyil> yes, a client

[18:36] <tadzik> and yet the moment you disconnect your client, you lose all the logs. That's why we had irclog.perlgeek.de all this time

[18:36] <tadzik> (all the logs that happen while you're gone)

[18:36] <tadzik> same for search

[18:36] <tyil> I'm never gone, I use a bouncer

[18:36] <tyil> :)

[18:36] <DrForr> tyil - like I said, you're more than welcome to participate over email if Slack doesn't meet your needs. I'm not going to be able to convince 30+ people (some rather nontechnical) to switch to IRC.

[18:36] <tadzik> the lack of persistent presence is arguably the most annoying "features" of IRC in this day and age

[18:36] <Grinnz> false - freenode disconnects you sometimes

[18:36] <tyil> DrForr: I'm suggesting email

[18:37] <tadzik> and the fact that we all use bouncers is obvious speaks volumes about that

[18:37] <tyil> DrForr: you're going to have a very hard time convincing me they dont know how email works, seeing as they needed to use it to join slack through invite to begin with

[18:37] <tyil> tadzik: yes, and there are services available like irccloud if you dont want to manage that yourself

[18:37] <Grinnz> email is a very different form of communication

[18:37] <tyil> but at least I have the freedom to do it the way suits *me* best

[18:38] <tadzik> ircclou looks proprietary

[18:38] <tyil> Slack only does their best to close things off after they lured in the simple people 

[18:38] <tyil> tadzik: yes, but irc isn't

[18:39] <tyil> clearly, there are people that give nothing about freedom, and they can use irccloud if they think it's worth it

[18:39] <sjn> tyil: there's also another aspect we should be honest about... are opnions like your and mine really the yardstick we should use to measure if a chat service is "good enough"?

[18:39] <tadzik> I'd rather use something open and competent than picking a legacy technology that either requires manual tinkering to make it not suck or pay a 3rdparty to manage it for you

[18:39] <tyil> and people that do care about it, like most people attending fosdem, can use free software only

[18:39] <sjn> I say maybe not

[18:39] <tyil> tadzik: "legacy" is only a bad word if you don't understand its merits

[18:39] <tyil> Perl has a lot of "legacy", for instance

[18:39] <tadzik> tyil: I really don't think merits outweight the downsides in this case

[18:40] <tyil> so have IRC and email, but they're still around, unlike all the alternatives that sprout up every couple years

[18:40] <tyil> sjn: perhaps not, but I still stand by forcing volunteers into hostile software for a free and open source event is disgusting

[18:41] <tyil> I'm not saying irc is the solution, I'm saying Slack is objectively a seriously bad option

[18:41] <tyil> and we can do better, I would hope

[18:42] <tyil> I'm gonna finish my dinner :)

[18:42] <tadzik> bon apetit :)

[18:47] <sjn> I really don't mind if someone takes that fight (or if they are a little more tactful, writes that blogpost)

[18:48] <sjn> In fact, I would love it if someone did that. I'm happy to adapt to whatever system where people choose to gather

[18:49] <tyil> sjn: https://davelane.nz/why-slack-better-and-why-open-communities-shouldnt-use-it && https://davelane.nz/arresting-slide-open-fauxpen

[18:50] <sjn> If noone chooses to pick up that gauntlet, I don't mind using less ideal solutions in the meantime. For me it's more important to reach the right people than to use the right softwaree

[18:50] <tyil> sadly, by using the wrong software, you're telling the right people to get lost

[18:50] <sjn> that isn't always true

[18:51] <sjn> it may be true *sometimes*, but not always

[18:51] <tyil> I never said always

[18:51] <tyil> its about this case

[18:52] <sjn> as you wrote it, you kinda implied it ;-)

[18:52] <sjn> but never mind that

[18:52] <tyil> not really

[18:53] <sjn> seriously, are there any good guidelines what FOSS communication stacks are availabout out there?

[18:53] <tadzik> unless you find the silver bullet, some of the right people will always be alienated by your choice of software though. Again, I do agree that Slack is an atrocious choice. But if your conversation revolves around non-techies and business people, slack may just be the easiest way for them

[18:54] <tyil> I'd say you, as the techie, should then teach them why it's shit, instead of letting them harm themselves and others because its "easy"

[18:54] <tadzik> I'd do that, and i push for that in the communities I'm involved in

[18:54] <tadzik> (or leave)

[18:55] <tyil> I wouldn't let my mom sign up for newsletters all the time if I can just tell her its not a great choice

[18:55] <tyil> since I understand, and she doesn't, it's good morals to teach her

[18:55] <tyil> instead of keeping this secret information to myself and just think "welp, she's just too dumb to understand"

[18:56] <tyil> sjn: i don't know, I just know of some alternatives that I would have no objection to use, and out of those, strongly prefer email since it's the one thing that literally *everyone* knows and has already

[18:57] <sjn> tyil: that's fair, but it also requires tuits to teach (and those are also in high demand), so if you want to scale up, it you might be better off using tech that either is easy to use (no need to spend teaching tuits) or make the community so attractive that people are willing to spend their tuits anyway

[18:58] <tyil> I'm already doing the latter right now

[18:58] <tyil> and again, literally everyone already knows how to send an email

[18:58] <sjn> mm, I hope everyone here tries the latter :)

[18:58] <tyil> and has one (or several) accounts to pick from

[18:58] <sjn> tyil: I know of people who really loathe email

[18:59] <sjn> so Problem Not Solved for Everybody

[18:59] <tyil> there's people loathing anything if you search hard enough, but something you can do with email that you can't with slack: just make your own client, or even server, and adapt it to *your* needs without begging a 3rd party for permision not to ban you forever

[19:00] <tyil> *and* keeping all your stuff to boot

[19:00] *** sena_kun joined
[19:00] <tyil> but perhaps email is not the best solution, which is why it should be discussed

[19:00] <Grinnz> i will just say this: you are not wrong in all of this, but presenting the case without any regard for what they gain by using slack (and they do) and with such vitriol is not going to get you anywhere

[19:01] <tyil> it's clear to anyone that has any sense of morality that forcing proprietary solutions unto volunteers for free software and communities is unacceptable

[19:01] <sjn> btw, who pays to keep the service up and running?

[19:01] <tyil> Grinnz: all the gains are illusions, so yes, I am quite aggressive in this stance

[19:01] <Grinnz> they are not.

[19:01] <Grinnz> and that is the problem here

[19:02] <tyil> no, the problem here is forcing volunteers to proprietary tools for a free community attending a free event

[19:02] <Grinnz> everything is a trade off. there are real consequences for all choices

[19:02] <tyil> there's plenty of alternatives, even slack-like solutions if you honestly believe people can't do without a shiny web ui that hogs memory like no tomorrow

[19:03] <tyil> indeed there are, and the consequence now is that volunteers are told "too bad, we don't care about you" 

[19:03] <tyil> I don't think that's something that deserves much praise

[19:04] <sjn> tyil: not everyone in the community are as opinionated as we who take part in this conversation. some people just want to be able to do their task with as little fuss as possible

[19:04] <DrForr> And some of us are:

[19:04] <tyil> sjn: I am part of those same people, that's why I like raku ;)

[19:04] <tyil> slack, however, does not do that in any way or sense

[19:04] <tyil> so I have to be non-lazy and call it out, to try and improve things

[19:06] <Grinnz> until you acknowledge how any of your suggestions will also disimprove things, and take a breath before you accuse people of choosing slack out of lack of morality, you are mostly accomplishing aggravating people

[19:06] <DrForr> tyil: Your opinion is definitely noted and I'll pass along your comments for the next time we need to do a volunteer callout. I will point out that I used email to ask for times and slots and I didn't een get a response on email.

[19:06] <tyil> perhaps you should try to read the links I posted

[19:07] <tyil> I'm pretty sure I responded with my times just fine

[19:07] <DrForr> I'm sure there are many reasons not to use Slack. Not the least is that I'm not a fan myself.

[19:08] <tyil> the plans given over email by stuart also wildly differed from the one you suddenly sent out

[19:09] <tyil> you're keeping out people who are literally the intended target for the event, and discussing things on a platform that has been pointed out to be in stark opposition of the events goals

[19:10] <sjn> tyil: today's chat was meant as a syncronization point, but in general, we're all volunteering so I hope you take that into account when setting your expectation levels

[19:10] <sjn> :)

[19:11] <tyil> and all were able to use email at the start, until someone decided to force everyone to slack and kill off all mail communication

[19:11] <DrForr> Uh.

[19:11] <tyil> my expectation levels are in line with the event's ideals and goals

[19:12] <tyil> it's in the name of the event

[19:15] <DrForr> I understand your feelings, and I agree that in the spirit of the event we should be using free software, and not Slack.

[19:17] <DrForr> I'm handling a lot of communications via email, and so far Stuart's been more comfortable using Slack and threaded conversations. I can certainly explain things and suggest that we switch to something like irc in that spirit.

[19:17] <tyil> thanks

[19:20] <sjn> tyil: If you're up for it, maybe you could put together a feature comparison list of the different FOSS and commercial options? That might help when trying to convince people :)

[19:22] <tyil> sjn: while I don't particularly mind, I tend to just use email and irc, and not much else, so I don't have a clear overview of the features

[19:22] <tyil> I'll add it on my todo list nonetheless though

[19:23] <sjn> tyil: well, helping others make informed decisions is a really good way to Make Things Happen

[19:23] <sjn> tyil: especially if you manage to come across as an informed and competent but neutral party

[19:23] <tyil> I know, I write blogposts and help people with issues in code and gnu+linux environments all the time

[19:24] <tyil> well, I'm not neutral to begin with

[19:24] <tyil> I know what Slack does and how the business behind it operates

[19:24] <tyil> if one cares about the users, they cannot in good conscious remain "neutral" when faced with Slack

[19:24] <sjn> (it's quite easy to dismiss people who come across as having a chip on their shoulder: "Are they sharing good points, or are they taking a biased position?"

[19:24] <sjn> )

[19:25] <tyil> I won't pretend I hold a position I don't on my own blog, though

[19:25] <sjn> tyil: ethical considerations are valid arguments too

[19:25] <tyil> seems like those are easily dismissed using the ostrich technique

[19:26] <tyil> very few people care to think about ethical rammifications

[19:26] <tyil> (often that is because they'd have to accept that their highly immoral, I find)

[19:26] <sjn> tyil: no need to pretend anything. if you aren't up for offering a heavy-hitting series of arguments (those can require a LOT of tuits), maybe it's better to just argue for one side without considering the other sides...

[19:27] <DrForr> I will point out there that a knowledge of context can help things.

[19:27] <sjn> it's like that with any communication - who is your audience, and what do they care about? you have to know that in order to get across points that they can accept

[19:27] <sjn> so yeah, context

[19:27] <tyil> the "other side" (Slack) has certainly been considered, and in no way, shape or form can I ever see it being a solution if you care even in the slightest remote about freedom, or your peers in general

[19:28] <tyil> I mean, if the people don't care about free software, I don't think they're the right audience for me to aim for

[19:28] <tyil> in which case I find it weird that these people attend a free software event in the first place

[19:29] <sjn> tyil: remember, that if you want to convince a loosly coupled community like ours, it's quite rare to be able to do that only by force of will... Everybody kinda has to find allies and take part in the communication game 

[19:29] <wildtrees> is riot.im and matrix free and/or open source? I use it from my phone via an app just fine , on some irc channels even with it, it was mentioned in passing already 

[19:29] <sjn> and all that has to be done with limited resources

[19:29] <tyil> wildtrees: yes, both are free as far as I understand!

[19:30] <tyil> sjn: considering Slack's humoungous per-user cost, I find this to be an odd statement

[19:30] <Grinnz> put another way: being right does not in itself get things done

[19:31] <DrForr> Speaking of limited resources, I'd like to make one point.

[19:31] <sjn> tyil: I'm not talking about slack specifically, but the general problem of consensus building in any open source community

[19:32] <tyil> I am talking about Slack specifically, though

[19:32] <tyil> since that is the problem here

[19:32] <sjn> tyil: so if you want to convince FOO to change platform away from slack, offer them arguments that are valid no matter the plaform they currently have

[19:33] <sjn> and blog about it, so others also can gain value from the knowledge and information and opinions you share

[19:33] <tyil> sjn: so far, these arguments have been dismissed with the ostrich technique in here, mostly about the free part of the software event 

[19:34] <sjn> if you're clever, you make sure that platforms like slack look really bad :)

[19:34] <tyil> I'm going to presume you didn't read either link I sent you

[19:34] <tyil> since they already do that quite well

[19:35] <tyil> which makes me skeptical as to why it would have any effect when I write about basically the same thing on my own blog

[19:35] <DrForr> From my standpoint as organizer, I have 3 (three) days left to make sure people are where we need them, banners, books and swag are where we need them, people are able to get their work done, and if there are any snags, I need to be able to help them.

[19:36] <DrForr> I would love to switch everyone over to a completely free/open communications network, but I also don't want to deal with snags.

[19:37] <rypervenche> Obviously not for right now and I don't know that we have a say in this, but having our own Slack-like alternative might fit the bill. It has desktop, mobile, and web apps for the software as well: https://zulipchat.com/

[19:37] <sjn> tyil: there is actually some value in repeating what others are saying

[19:37] <rypervenche> I haven't used it, but I've heard talk of it.

[19:37] <tyil> fosdem is in 6 days (well, the Friday build up at least), and the issue has been made clear way before that through email, so while I understand your stress about it, please don't stretch things to look worse

[19:37] <tyil> it's not something I bring up *just* as late as I could to be a bother

[19:37] <sjn> I wouldn't be surprised if there are other arguments to add, too

[19:37] <DrForr> Aaaah, that's your perspective.

[19:38] <tyil> rypervenche: zulip is good from what I heard, but people told me Rocket.Chat is more like Slack if that's the idea they think they need

[19:39] * sjn has tried rocket, and it's ok

[19:39] <sjn> a bit buggy though

[19:39] <tyil> zulip is purely based around threads, though

[19:39] <DrForr> And for all you know, I don't have a damn thing to do until I automatically *pop* up at FOSDEM. Which is not true.

[19:39] <tyil> and it sounded like this was desired a bit earlier

[19:39] <tyil> DrForr: same goes for me, so I'm unsure what you're trying to accomplish now

[19:40] <sjn> DrForr: I don't think that tyil is arguing for making a change *now* :)

[19:40] <tyil> just saying you might want to not stretch things around to make me look like a boogeyman that's just out to get you at the most inconvenient time

[19:41] <tyil> sjn: I would if I could, but I have to accept reality in this regard :p

[19:41] <DrForr> Please, I'm not trying to play games and make someone look like the "bad man" here.

[19:41] <sjn> tyil: exactly, just like the rest of us have to.

[19:42] <tyil> sjn: well, I would like to agree there, but reality is that theres still people pushing proprietary software in order to help out at a free software event!

[19:42] <tyil> in a community that seems to would do well with more volunteers, I'm quite amazed they're so hard against opening up to them

[19:43] <sjn> tyil: also, let's continue this discussion sometime after FOSDEM, since we really can't do anything about it now anyway, and you've gotten your point across, and I've given you a few tips on how to make that point land well in other people's minds. :)

[19:44] <tyil> I fear the topic being dropped completely if it's not a constant spark in the minds of those that need to reconsider past choices

[19:44] <tyil> especially since after fosdem, it's quite easy for people to say "well, the open event has passed, so we dont need to think about openness anymore"

[19:47] <tyil> sjn: why not during fosdem?

[19:48] <DrForr> Before things break up, I'm *leaving* for FOSDEM on the 28th becuase I need to be there ahead of time. I'm also unpacking what I have, washing, repacking for two events *and* setting up a home office for my brand new job. We've *ALL* got stuff going on before, during, and after these things, and pretending that you don't need to make allowances for others' time, effort or feelings is bogus.

[19:49] <tyil> I was told to be there on Friday, so I planned for that

[19:50] <tyil> DrForr: again, I'm not pretending that at all, I raised my concerns before, please don't act like this

[19:50] <sjn> tyil: I'll be spending a lot of time at fosdem doing Perl/Raku booth things

[19:51] <tyil> if I was told people were needed earlier, I would've planned for that

[19:51] <tyil> but alas

[19:51] <sjn> tyil: but sure, if you want, the two of us can sit down with my recording equipment and have a conversation about communication tech in open source communities! 

[19:51] <sjn> I'd love that

[19:51] <sjn> I plan to do some interviews at FOSDEM

[19:51] <tyil> I'm planning to spend a lot of time at the booth too

[19:51] <tyil> I've made quite a number of modules, so I Hope to be able to answer many questions

[19:52] <sjn> tyil: great, let's set aside an hour or so sometime to have a chat about that

[19:52] <DrForr> tyil - Here's what happened with that. Wendy publicly decided not to ask for a booth this year because of some of her questions. 

[19:52] <tyil> yes, that's something I knew for about a year

[19:52] <DrForr> At that point, TPF or someone should have picked up. Nobody did until Andrew did, a few months ago.

[19:53] <DrForr> He was going to just label it a Raku booth, and was assuming there would be Raku-branded swag.

[19:54] <tyil> yes

[19:54] <sjn> tyil: would you be up for that? (it's likely we'll either publish it as part of a relaunch of the Perlcast podcast, or some other channel - I have a few options)

[19:54] <DrForr> Nobody knew that until I pointed out that the "Introducing Perl 6" booklet didn't say Raku, and I offered to help.

[19:54] <tyil> sjn: so long as there's no requirement to be sober, otherwise we haave to do it *right* after I wake up :)

[19:54] <tyil> but yes, I am certainly up for that

[19:55] <DrForr> Instead of asking for help, he dropped the booth in TPF's lap at which point I stepped in to do organizing because I've been to 10+ of these things and know most of the people that are involved.

[19:56] <DrForr> So *that* is why things came together so late. It sucks, but we're making do with what we have, and I've been paddling *mightily* behind the scenes to make sure that we get little things like buttons and banners ready.

[19:57] <sjn> tyil: well, I'd like to have a coherent interlocutor, so we can try on Friday? I'll be at ULB Solbosch hopefully before noon, so I'll have a couple hours free to do stuff before we get our booth

[19:57] <tyil> sjn: my train's scheduled to arrive 14:17, we can make some time after the booth is all set up

[19:57] <sjn> sure

[19:57] <sjn> let's see what we can do

[20:02] <DrForr> And I can talk about blogging and my module conversion strategies, though during a lunch break might be more appropriate for me.

[21:01] <brisby> There's no way to do it with a list?

[21:03] <tobs> brisby: no, a List is immutable (cannot assign to allocated items and not extend the list). The mutable version of it is called Array.

[21:04] *** mahmudov left
[21:04] <tobs> but if someone gives you a list, you can call .Array on it to get back a copy of that list as an array, to which you can append.

[21:05] <brisby> There's nothing that returns a new list, like in Haskell?

[21:05] <tyil> m: my List $foo = ('a', 'b', 'c'); my List $bar = (|$foo, 'd'); say $bar;

[21:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b c d)‚ê§¬ª

[21:05] <tobs> oh, you can totally create a new list that contains the old one and another element

[21:05] <tyil> would this work?

[21:05] <tobs> as tyil shows

[21:06] <brisby> Append brings together 2 lists, that looks more like cons

[21:08] *** Kaiepi left
[21:08] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:09] <brisby> Raku is really the first language I've encountered that doesn't provide an (immutable) list append typically (++)

[21:10] <tyil> i would expect an immutable list to be, well, immutable, though

[21:10] <brisby> append doesn't mutate the list, it creates a new immutable list from two immutable lists

[21:13] <tobs> what tyil showed (|$foo, 'd') can be used on two lists as well. If you need it to be an operator, I don't think it exists, no.

[21:14] <tobs> m: multi infix:<++> (List:D $l1, List:D $l2) is assoc<list> { List.new: |$l1, |$l2 }; say <a b c> ++ <x y z>  # shouldn't stop you from creating it, however

[21:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b c x y z)‚ê§¬ª

[21:15] <brisby> does it work for a list of lists?

[21:16] <tyil> as in @foo ++ @bar ++ @baz?

[21:16] *** rindolf left
[21:16] <tyil> multi infix:<++> (List:D $l1, List:D $l2) is assoc<list> { List.new: |$l1, |$l2 }; say <a b c> ++ <x y z> ++ <1 2 3>

[21:17] <tyil> m: multi infix:<++> (List:D $l1, List:D $l2) is assoc<list> { List.new: |$l1, |$l2 }; say <a b c> ++ <x y z> ++ <1 2 3>

[21:17] <tobs> it can be made to work

[21:17] <tyil> not exactly like this, but it can be done I'm sure

[21:17] <tobs> m: multi infix:<++> (*@lol) is assoc<list> { List.new: ||¬´@lol }; say <a b c> ++ <x y z> ++ <1 2 3>

[21:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b c x y z 1 2 3)‚ê§¬ª

[21:18] <tyil> nice

[21:18] <tobs> although I'm surprised that ||¬´ parses correctly :D

[21:18] <tobs> I mean parses and does the right thing

[21:18] <tyil> m: multi infix:<++> (*@lol) is assoc<list> { List.new: ||¬´@lol }; say <a b c> ++ (<1 2 3>, <7 8 9>);

[21:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b c 1 2 3 7 8 9)‚ê§¬ª

[21:18] <tyil> neat

[21:20] *** wamba left
[21:20] <rypervenche> What does the :D mean in the parameter list?

[21:21] <tyil> rypervenche: I believe it means "definite", but I remember it as "defined"

[21:21] <rypervenche> Thanks, that got me the search result I was looking for :)

[21:22] <tyil> brisby: can you show me a 1-line code sample of what you're trying to achieve that's not working the way you expected? (preferably with the output you *did* expect, so we can try to work towards that)

[21:27] <brisby> tyril: I was just wondering if I overlooked this operator since I couldn't find it in the documentation.  It is literally the first operator defined in Data.List for Haskell and since Raku was originally written in Haskell, I expected it.  Note that all lists in Haskell are immutable.

[21:28] *** kensanata joined
[21:28] <brisby> However, suppose I wanted to create a functional method that accumulated all the permutations of a list, how could this be accomplished?  I don't want the inner permutations flattened.

[21:35] <tobs> getting flattening right is always a bit of a struggle...

[21:35] <tobs> m: multi infix:<++> (+@lol) is assoc<list> { List.new: |@lol¬ª.Slip }; dd <a b> ++ <x y>.permutations.List ++ <u v>

[21:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37ddd5984: OUTPUT: ¬´("a", "b", ("x", "y"), ("y", "x"), "u", "v")‚ê§¬ª

[21:35] <tobs> this seems to do it

[21:38] <brisby> The use of '@' coerces it to an Array though right?

[21:42] <brisby> Raku is clearly an imperative language.

[22:11] <rypervenche> Does anyone know of a good module to do what zenity does? Essentially something like a GTK entry widget. Looking to make a little popup so I can type in some text and a password. Inform does what I need, but you can't press Enter to submit it, which was a choice. GTK::Simple looks good too, but doesn't have that or hiding text.

[22:12] *** mahmudov joined
[22:15] <tyil> I sadly don't, but would be very interested in hearing about it if you do find one

[22:16] <rypervenche> I have a feeling I'll have to update one of these modules if I want the functionality. I don't know enough yet though. Maybe I can figure my way through it. I was going to use this as a way to convert one of my Bash scripts to Raku to get some practice learning the language :P I might have to choose a different project though.
