[01:13] <ToddAndMargo> Anyone on newbie duty?  A question on the "use" in a class declaration.  In "is $.x". does the dot have a special meaning or is it just to make the value ($.x) easier to access ($objectname.x)?

[01:14] <ToddAndMargo> typo.  "is $.x" should have been "use $.x".  :'(

[01:42] *** RaycatWhoDat joined
[01:43] <RaycatWhoDat> Hello. Currently working on day 04 of Advent of Code (because I forgot about it).

[01:44] <RaycatWhoDat> I think something is wrong with my grammar but, for some reason, it says 181 or 189 passports are correct. 

[01:44] <RaycatWhoDat> But the correct answer is neither of these.

[01:44] <RaycatWhoDat> Not sure where I went wrong.

[01:45] <RaycatWhoDat> <https://github.com/RayMPerry/advent-of-code/blob/master/2020/04/day04.raku>

[01:55] <guifa2> ToddAndMargo:  Where did you see "use $.x"?  'use' is normally followed by a module name, and '$.x' would normally be preceeded by "has"

[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> I shortened things too much.  Here is an example of the whole thing:     class Fruit {       has Str $.location is rw;       has UInt $.apples  is rw;       has UInt $.oranges is rw;       has UInt $.bananas is rw;   }

[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> my $FruitStand = Fruit.new( location => "Cucamonga",                               apples   => 400,                               oranges  => 200,                               bananas  => 50  );

[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> print $FruitStand.location ~ "has " ~ $FruitStand.apples ~" apples in stock\n";

[01:59] <ToddAndMargo> I am just wondering if the dot in $FruitStand.apples is there just to make it easier to access or does the dot have a special meaning

[02:06] <guifa2> The dot itself is technically an operator, it means "call the method 'apples' on the preceeding object".  So $FruitStand.apples translates to "call the method 'apples' on the object $FruitStand"

[02:06] *** cooper left
[02:07] <ToddAndMargo> If I was to declare apples as "use $apples", instead of .apples, would it mess things up?

[02:10] <[Coke]> has and use both have specific meanings, so yes.

[02:10] <guifa2> Yes, it would.  $apples is not a module, which is what 'use' is for

[02:11] <[Coke]> if you mean "has $apples", yes, attributes should be declared with a sigil and either a ! twigil (private) or . (public)

[02:12] <ToddAndMargo> Okay, I think I understand now.  Thank you!  (And no wonder some examples I has seen did not work.)

[02:35] <guifa2> Is there any way to fake input to prompt for the purpose of testting?

[02:35] <guifa2> I tried $*IN.say but that doesn't seem to work

[02:38] *** rindolf joined

[19:11] <m6locks> anybody ever tried this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7bNYVdUVw

[19:14] <Altai-man> m6locks, it works, but is more buggy compared to moarvm, also is known to be much slower, due to less people actively maintaining it.

[19:15] <m6locks> would have guessed it is faster because jvm

[19:17] <m6locks> ok well they mention the speed issue right in the beginning

[19:18] *** wamba joined
[19:18] <Altai-man> m6locks, well, Java is a simple language and Raku is much more flexible, especially around its object model, but also a looot of other things. I mean, it all boils down to how nice you can project the abstractions from high-level to JVM level. More maintainers mean more speed.

[20:52] <MasterDuke> m6locks: the jvm backend can be faster than moarvm, but only after lots of iterations or for long-running tasks. pmurias is working on a truffle implementation of the jvm backend. it's not complete, but on one or two things is faster than both normal jvm backend and moravm
