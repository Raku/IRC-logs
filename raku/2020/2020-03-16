[00:04] <rypervenche> Ah yeah. I was looking for something to automatically give me the affixes.

[00:07] <guifa> Yeaha, that bit requires the RBNF stuff.  You can find it in cldr/commons/rbnf/zh.xml for Chinese

[00:07] <guifa> If you had time and wanted to write the RBNF parser though … hahahaha

[00:21] <SmokeMachine> running the server as `docker run --network=mysql --name=mysql --rm -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=bla -e MYSQL_DATABASE=bla -e MYSQL_USER=bla -e MYSQL_PLUGIN_DIR=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin mysql` is not giving that error anymore... but it's not accepting my password...

[00:22] <SmokeMachine> I think I found it!

[00:22] <rypervenche> guifa: I've spend the past two days trying to figure out the logic in that and get Lingua::Number to work. The code is beyond me for the moment. I'll look into it later on once I know more about Raku and can maybe decipher more things. :) The desire is there, the know-how, not yet.

[02:50] <guifa> rypervenche: yeah, the Lingua::Number was done loooong ago and it works so no one has updated the internals.  He uses a complicated regex, I’m going to use a grammar/actions, and hopefully give some super friendly interfaces for it.  (particulary I think it would be good to throw an exception if a number gets to be too big, or if that type isn’t supported for the language, in the exception I could possibly provide an alternate representa

[02:50] <guifa> that might not be perfect, but is better than nothing, and since it’s excepted, someone can decide whether they want it or not)

[15:54] <jnthn> System for testing all of the modules against the latest Rakudo HEAD, used to identify compiler regressions so Rakudo releases can be more reliable.

[15:54] <jnthn> I figure part of the joke is that "blin!" is often used to mean "dammit!" too. :)

[15:54] <chloekek> Thanks!

[15:55] * Altai-man_ probably should name issues `Blin, 2020.03, round N`

[15:56] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: it's also an improvement over Toaster, which is another food-related name :)

[17:21] *** Altai-man_ left
[17:21] <AlexDaniel> guifa: not sure if that's because they simply can't get the infrastructure right for that amount of testing, or if they just want the numbers to be low :D

[17:22] <jnthn> guifa: No, almost certianly not that.

[17:23] <jnthn> I got it from somebody else, who themselves got it before before there were any COVID-19 cases known in .cz

[17:25] <lizmat> guifa: testing in NL only happens if you have symptoms

[17:25] <lizmat> therefore the actual number of infections is currently estimated to be 6x the number of proven infections

[17:25] <lizmat> of course, that's just that: estimations

[17:26] <lizmat> together with the knowledge that there may well be asymptomatic carriers

[17:26] <guifa> if I got it it may have actually been from NL, actually.  Singapore (my main destination) has things extremely under control

[17:26] <guifa> vrurg: I just merged the pull request, sorry, I dunno why github didn’t notify about FuzzyToken but did with Carp.

[17:26] <lizmat> aka, people who are infectious but show no symptoms 

[17:27] <guifa> jnthn: any ideas why the Mac version of Comma is 404’ing?

[17:27] <lizmat> guifa: Rotterdam University is mapping the strains in NL, most of them are from China

[17:30] <jnthn> guifa: Notarization failures, but I should check on the status of resolving that. Shipping desktop apps for Mac is horrible at this point. :/

[17:36] <guifa> jnthn: noted.  It’s been a while since I’ve developed an app on the Mac, and it was long before the need to sign apps and I know lots of developers have had issues with it

[17:36] *** stoned75 left
[17:40] <jnthn> Well, we had signing working for a while, then notarization came along, and after no small amount of work we got that integrated into the build process, and then a month later something changed (seemingly on Apple's side) that broke it.

[21:21] <Grinnz> re: https://twitter.com/liztormato/status/1239597522240376832 - I am pretty sure it is the presence of the Perl6/ subdirectory that distinguishes raku dists on CPAN alone, I think changing the name of META6.json would be only up to the raku tools that deal with it

[21:22] <Grinnz> (for instance, if a raku dist is uploaded outside of Perl6/, it still shows up as a perl release even with a META6.json)

[21:24] <Grinnz> https://fastapi.metacpan.org/v1/file/_search?q=name:META6.json

[21:27] *** theangryepicbana joined
[21:27] <theangryepicbana> so I saw the thing about repl.it in the most recent newsletter

[21:28] <theangryepicbana> just thought I'd mention that repl.it is actually using the most recent version of raku

[21:28] <theangryepicbana> even though it says 2019.03 or whatever

[21:30] <theangryepicbana> hopefully someone can pass that on to whoever writes/wrote the newsletter

[21:36] <[ptc]> theangryepicbana: lizmat writes the newsletter

[21:36] <[ptc]> lizmat: ^^^^

[21:36] <theangryepicbana> ah ok

[21:39] <theangryepicbana> also if you're curious, if you use repl.it/languages/perl6 rather than repl.it/languages/raku, it does have some syntax highlighting (and that's an issue I need to bring back up to the devs too)

[21:40] <Grinnz> btw, I am slowly working to make it so Raku/ will be an allowed CPAN subdirectory as well, but don't expect anything soon :)

[21:43] *** theangryepicbana left
[21:49] <lizmat> Grinnz: what you said is true and not true: the existence of META6.json is used as a flag to put the distribution into a /Perl6 directory

[21:49] <lizmat> if you're working on the PAUSE code, then by all means, but please make sure that these changes will not cause any Perl toolchain fallout

[21:50] <lizmat> that has happened in the past and it was frowned upon, rather severely

[21:50] <Grinnz> it would be nothing more than an adaptation of the current use of Perl6/, and I won't be pushy about it

[21:51] <Grinnz> metacpan actually already supports Raku/, but PAUSE will take longer

[21:54] <Grinnz> when you say META6.json is used as a flag, is it PAUSE that does that or the raku upload tool?

[21:54] <lizmat> .tell theangryepicbana if it is using the most recent version, why on earth is it telling 2019.03.1 on start up

[21:54] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to theangryepicbana

[21:54] <lizmat> Grinnz: PAUSE

[21:54] <Grinnz> alright

[21:54] <theangryepicbana> lizmat: It's most likely because the version headers aren't automatically updated

[21:54] <lizmat> the upload tool just uploads it to the top directory, PAUSE moves it to /Perl6

[21:55] <Grinnz> hmm, but some still get uploaded to top level with META6.json by accident

[21:55] <theangryepicbana> I'll be asking the devs if they can update it sometime soon :)

[21:56] *** stoned75 left
[21:56] <lizmat> Grinnz: are you sure?  the name of the file has to be META6.json exactly

[21:56] <lizmat> META6.JSON probably won't cut it

[21:56] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/source/TBROWDER/Text-Utils-Raku-1.0.0 from december

[21:57] *** stoned75 joined
[21:57] <lizmat> odd...  I have no explanation for that

[21:57] <Grinnz> (it has 7 passes on cpantesters - lol)

[21:58] <lizmat> I know it took 3 toolchain summits to get the currently functionality in there

[21:58] * [Coke] hopes everyone is having a good day.

[21:58] <lizmat> and that changes to PAUSE are fraught with potential widespread consequences

[21:58] <Grinnz> I'll take a look into the code at some point

[22:00] <lizmat> .tell tbrowder you might want to re-upload Text-Utils-Raku: https://metacpan.org/source/TBROWDER/Text-Utils-Raku-1.0.0

[22:00] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[22:00] <Grinnz> I think he did shortly after that

[22:00] *** stoned75 left
[22:01] <lizmat> .tell tbrowder somehow it wound up in PAUSE as a Perl module, rather than as a Raku module

[22:01] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[22:01] <tbrowder> yes, and i thought i deleted the other...i'll take a look...

[22:02] <Grinnz> you did, that is from backpan

[22:05] <tbrowder> ah, ok

[22:43] <tbrowder> tony-o: 2 things: (1) your docker nightly in my travis run seems to have a problem and (2) i would like to help test zeco

[22:43] <tbrowder> .tell tony-o ^^^

[22:43] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tony-o_

[22:47] <xinming> SmokeMachine: Is it possible to do model-role? Just like normal roles, But it has column definition in them

[22:48] <SmokeMachine> xinming: usual roles should work for that...

[22:50] <SmokeMachine> xinming: for example: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/t/13-roles.t

[22:55] <SmokeMachine> xinming: just curious, what are you trying to do?

[22:57] <tbrowder> .tell tony-o the travis thing appears to be their problem, a restart worked

[22:57] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tony-o_

[23:08] <xinming> SmokeMachine: I don't do thing for the moment, It's just a thought that we may need for same data type.

[23:09] <xinming> I didn't touch coding for 2 month, Only playing games and watching the movie. because of corna-virus thing makes me very depressed. :-)
