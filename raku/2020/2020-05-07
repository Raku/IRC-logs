[09:14] <andrzejku> I want to ask you whethever that's a good idea to use raku as oneliner on embedded device but compile it using toolchain as it is on it by default and run it thorough usb?

[09:14] <andrzejku> or maybe it is not possible at all

[09:19] <Altreus> Don't know if it's really optimised for low-resource devices

[13:23] <konvertex> Playing around with raku for the first time, wondering whether the mem usage is expected to drop over the coming releases (2020.01, atm) just as performance improves each version. 90mb+ (res) for 'puts "foo"' is four times more than chubby sbcl. :(

[13:27] <sena_kun> konvertex, it is expected (we cannot promise, but there are steps taken in this direction).

[13:32] <konvertex> That's good to hear. Say, is part of that work scheduled for the upcoming release or expected to land much later?

[13:36] <sena_kun> konvertex, it is a question hard to answer. There are various things affecting memory usage, small and big. More so, it is really hard to predict how much one or another change would affect both performance and/or mem usage. I would not expect the next release to be 10x times better than the previous one, but people are working on that as well.

[13:41] <konvertex> Alright, will patiently wait and see what the devs are cooking up. Thanks!

[13:44] <lizmat> konvertex: if you have specific issues that bar you from using Raku, it would help if you could submit an issue for that

[13:44] <lizmat> konvertex: sometimes (well, less often nowadays), it can be fixed rather easily, as it was previously overlooked

[13:45] *** Cabanossi joined
[13:48] *** mowcat left
[13:49] <konvertex> Well, as a language learner, the excessive mem usage, atleast compared to p5, ruby, scheme, lisp and such, is pretty much the only thing that has jumped at me yet.

[14:16] <lizmat> do you do a lot with strings?

[14:16] <lizmat> because strings internally are 32bits / codepoint afaik

[14:20] <AlexDaniel> on unix that is

[14:21] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: \n should be just \n, it'd be weird if it was any different

[14:41] <lizmat> 86M for raku -e '' seems to be the current state of affairs indeed

[16:12] <ctilmes_> MasterDuke: re making a CArray[uint8] from a Buf, since they are kind of the same thing, couldn't you just cheat and say nativecast(CArray[uint8], $buf);?  You would have to be careful to hold the reference to avoid GC, but it could be faster for  a huge Blob, right?

[16:13] <ctilmes_> MasterDuke: and be careful not to read past the end of the array
