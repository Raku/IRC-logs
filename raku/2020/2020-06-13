[02:16] <jdv79> where is any sort of real timeout functionality done in terms of networking or such?

[02:17] <jdv79> i don't see anything in IO::Socket, for example

[02:18] <jdv79> also, where and/or how could/would that sort of thing be done, say, in cro or another random network client/server?

[08:33] <grondilu> One javascript feature I wish was in raku is the way variables declarations can be chained.  Like 'let x = 13, y = x + 1, z = 2*x;'  It's not possible to do anything like that in raku with just one line, is it ?

[08:34] <grondilu> (or 'let x = 13, y = x + 1, z = 2*y'

[08:34] <grondilu> )

[08:35] <grondilu> I would have to write 'my $x = 14; my $y = $x + 1; my $z = 2*$y', wouldn't I?

[12:50] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Yes.

[12:50] <patrickb> I'm working on a tool to generate native exec runner programs

[12:50] <patrickb> Needs to do some C compiling.

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: can you rename it to `ake`? `maku` is a funny alternative but tab-completion works so much better with ake

[12:51] <patrickb> And as I'm an outspoken make hater, I thought I'd give sake a try.

[12:51] <patrickb> what's wrong with 'sake'?

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: see https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake/issues/19

[12:54] *** Altai-man_ joined
[12:55] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I can have a look. We don't want to start bikeshedding again, do we? Just go for 'ake'?

[12:58] <patrickb> Is using '.rakumod' encouraged by now? I think I remember it being discouraged to still work on older compilers...

[12:58] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: there are a bunch of upvotes, it was proposed by audrey herself, it's not taken by any binary, it should autocomplete from akTAB on most systems unlike maku which requires to write it fully, Makufile looks too similar to Makefile while Akefile is positively distinct

[12:59] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: you can use .rakumod or .my-lovely-modules, it makes no difference for installed modules because META6.json defines your module files

[12:59] <patrickb> I'll go for 'ake'.

[12:59] <patrickb> fine then :-)

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> thank you :)

[13:01] <patrickb> Does the 'not discouraged' bit also apply to '.rakutest'?

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: if you use .t and include a raku shebang in your files then `make` will work by default without requiring any extra options

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> sorry not make but `prove`

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> soooo… I don't see any point in .rakutest :S

[13:04] <patrickb> So we should stick with '.t' until prove6 is the thing everyone uses.

[13:21] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: no, let's just move it

[13:21] <patrickb> What about current users of sake?

[13:22] <patrickb> Moving it will kill sake from the ecosystem.

[13:23] <AlexDaniel> moved!

[13:23] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: the repo placement doesn't have much to do with the rename. Github will set up redirects and it'll work

[13:24] <patrickb> Then we need to set up a new release on p6c to reference the last sake commit to keep it working.

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I think as long as you have "provides" : { "Sake" : "…" } it will be installable

[13:25] <patrickb> Ah! So you want it to provide an alias.

[13:25] <AlexDaniel> yea

[13:26] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: as for ake itself as a tool, feel free to modify it to suit your needs. When I first touched it, it was in a somewhat weird state. I think I made it more usable, and I wrote a lot of tests, but because there were no tests before I might have broken it in some ways… I'm not sure

[18:04] <poohman> hello all

[18:05] <poohman> in Raku regexes must : be escaped with a \?

[18:05] <poohman> if yes, what else could it mean in the regex?

[18:06] <timotimo> : is for backtracking control i think?

[18:06] <timotimo> but in general, all non-letters have to be backslashed or quoted to match literally

[18:06] <timotimo> even if they don't have an assigned meaning without a backslash

[18:08] <poohman> ok

[18:09] <poohman> Thanks timotimo

[19:53] <softmoth> CIAvash, it took ~3 weeks for me about 2 months ago....

[19:57] <softmoth> but scheduling of everything was pear-shaped at that time, so I didn't bother to ping anyone. But it *did* get handled!

[19:57] <[Coke]> huh, all my CPAN stuff aged out.
