[02:58] <rypervenche> TWEAK will only get called at the creation of an object, correct? If I update an attribute it won't run again?

[03:00] <rypervenche> I don't know why I didn't just test that. Looks like it's only on creation. :)

[06:57] <Kaiepi> i'm finally getting around to writing the documentation for Trait::Traced's plugin support

[06:58] <Kaiepi> i worry that i'm not clear enough about how to use the apis it provides, since they're very generic though

[06:58] <Kaiepi> is this clear about how you work with custom trace types? https://github.com/Kaiepi/ra-Trait-Traced/wiki/Custom-Tracing

[22:03] <terminatorul> Hello guys !

[22:03] <terminatorul> Is there a way to implement this please ?

[22:03] <terminatorul> m: role R[$a] { }; role Q[$b] does R[$b] { }

[22:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar f2464e338: ( no output )

[22:03] <terminatorul> Oh ... in here it works ...

[22:04] <terminatorul> How do I avoid the error "No appropriate parametric role variant available for 'R'" ?

[22:04] <terminatorul> That I get on my system ?

[22:05] <terminatorul> m: $*PERL

[22:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar f2464e338: ( no output )

[22:05] <terminatorul> m: say $*PERL

[22:06] <terminatorul> 6.d is the version I have also, but on my perl it doesn't work...

[22:09] <lizmat> terminatorul: ^^ what does that say for you ?

[22:09] <lizmat> bisectable6: role R[$a] { }; role Q[$b] does R[$b] { }

[22:09] <bisectable6> lizmat, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[22:09] <terminatorul> v2020.05.1

[22:09] <bisectable6> lizmat, ¬¶6c (46 commits): ¬´¬ª

[22:09] <bisectable6> lizmat, Nothing to bisect!

[22:10] <terminatorul> I installed Rakduo star...

[22:10] <lizmat> terminatorul: could you try changing the names?   Q[] may cause some parsing issues, Istr

[22:12] <terminatorul> Wow ... suddenly it works now ?!!!

[22:12] <terminatorul> m: role Handle[$a] { }; role QuraTy[$b, $c] does Handle[$b] { }

[22:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar f2464e338: ( no output )

[22:12] <terminatorul> What about the name Q ?

[22:13] <jdv79> https://docs.raku.org/syntax/Q i'd guess

[22:15] <terminatorul> Indeed, thank you !

[22:22] <terminatorul> m: role ClassCode[Str $a] { sub show-it { say $a } }; role SQLState[Str $b, Str $c] does ClassCode[$b] { }; SQLState['HY', '0010'].new.show-it
