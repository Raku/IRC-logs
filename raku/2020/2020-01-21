[00:01] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I'd like to connect CircleCI to github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew What's the best way to do that? Using my own GitHub and CircleCI account?

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: actually I don't know!

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: can we do it for Raku org somehow?

[00:02] <patrickb> CircleCI works using a OAuth GitHub app. I'd guess it's always connected to a GitHub account.

[00:03] <patrickb> There is no non-person Raku github account, is there?

[00:03] *** dirty_talk joined
[00:03] <dirty_talk> hi. which is better for text manipulation, Perl or Raku ?

[00:03] * AlexDaniel looks at https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014599088-My-GitHub-organization-is-not-listed

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> dirty_talk: depends on the kind of text you have

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> dirty_talk: if you have many thousands of lines and need some basic manipulation, then perhaps Perl will be faster

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> dirty_talk: if the processing needs to be unicode aware then Raku will likely do better

[00:04] <guifa2> dirty_talk: that depends a bit.  Perl is a bit faster at the moment and better supported on other systems, Raku has a bunch more power but isn't installed by default on many distributions (yet)

[00:06] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I clicked something

[00:07] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: An email just told me, that CircleCI can now access Raku through my account, because I already had it enabled for my personal account and the org is now also enabled...

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: oook

[00:08] <patrickb> I'll see if this is already all I need. Thanks!

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: let me know, chances are I'll need to bump your level in the org

[00:08] *** guifa2 left
[00:14] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I managed to access the Raku org through the circleci website, but see no repository.

[00:14] <AlexDaniel> hold on

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[00:15] <lizmat> .tell guifa2 I only see uploads to CPAN and new entries in ecosystem

[00:15] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to guifa2

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> Installed GitHub Apps: Travis CI

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> I don't see CircleCI for some reason

[00:16] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: It's an OAuth app

[00:16] <AlexDaniel> which means?

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> it is not supposed to appear there?

[00:17] *** guifa2 joined
[00:18] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: For me the Github -> Settings -> Applications Tab has three tabs: Installed GitHub Apps, Authorized Github Apps, Authorized OAuth Apps.

[00:18] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: CircleCI is listed on that last tab

[00:18] <patrickb> Also repos just started to show up on the CircleCI website.

[00:18] <patrickb> Maybe all is well already...

[00:18] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I think I've just enabled something

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> you just need the config file

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> ah it's already there?

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> ok, so, what about now?

[00:20] <patrickb> looking very good

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> I see now, yeah

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> it added a key, hmm

[00:22] *** guifa2 left
[00:28] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: The Windows and Linux builds are working already. I've just requested MacOS access. Once that's granted and I get it building there too, we'll have a fully automated release build process for Rakubrew. :-D

[00:50] <Doc_Holliwould> changes?

[00:50] <dirty_talk> Doc_Holliwould cause i'm a stupid guy

[00:51] <dirty_talk> also Ook as nothing exciting

[00:51] <dirty_talk> it's hard to excite me. Trust me

[00:51] <Doc_Holliwould> well. there is your answer

[01:06] <rypervenche> Yep, I've seen that. What you wrote is great though, because I'm not great at breaking my code up into subroutines like you did. And you also did the set thing I was having trouble figuring out :)

[01:10] <Doc_Holliwould> There is a "problem" with the code as in it doesnt complain when you put -d and -x at the command line

[01:11] <Doc_Holliwould> the latter than being ignored. You could catch that with an if in the main function checking for that

[01:13] <Doc_Holliwould> or you put it like so, but that means a bit of repition: https://gist.github.com/holli-holzer/a909c080d5d4f4f4d577ede48158b346

[04:14] <guifa2> ToddAndMargo: note that "returns Associative" could return a hash or a map or even a pair.  To strictly return just a hash, you would use sub x returns Hash { … }, or sub x (--> Hash) { … }

[19:15] <TreyHarris> guifa: excellent work on Carp--I used it a lot in P5 and when I inquired about it in 2016 according to channel logs, I was told it wasn't yet implementable in rakudo. I guess I missed the change that enabled it

[19:35] <tony-o> .tell tbrowder there's a regression in the MOP that makes the way xoos builds ORM objects fail in current (just a heads up)

[19:35] <tellable6> tony-o, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[19:36] <tbrowder> tony-o: thnx

[19:38] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: Not trying to go all toddandmargo on this, but it feels like the nonworking SO example is so untuitive that we need an explataion about why creating a custom subtype can't be done like that

[19:38] <TreyHarris> Unless you've played around with allomorphs it probably wouldn't even occur to you

[19:39] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:39] <TreyHarris> s/untuitive/intuitive/ # I mean, it seems like it should work

[19:40] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: unintuitive?

[19:40] <tellable6> 2020-01-21T15:13:45Z #raku <tbrowder> jmerelo: with new doc process where do we find how to defne the article sort order within doc categories?

[19:40] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: no, i mean intuitive, just typoed

[19:40] <jmerelo> tbrowder: hi! There are no doc categories now, just metadata at the top of the classes. Just check it out.

[19:40] <TreyHarris> `class MyInt is Int { ... }` just feels like it really should work

[19:41] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: yep, we really need an example. The problem (from the docs point of view) is that I'm not sure Jnthn's comment is spec.

[19:41] <TreyHarris> Especially if you're coming from a language like Ruby where augmenting of base classes is enabled by default

[19:42] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: Thus the note, which basically says "This does not work in the way you thought it would work"

[19:42] <tbrowder> jmerelo: yes, but in my look at documentable i saw there was a process, so, has that been deleted or just not used?

[19:42] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: Oh, no, I'm not disagreeing with your commit, it's great--just agreeing with you that we really need an example

[19:43] <TreyHarris> jmerelo:and also unsure about spec... trying to find anything in that ballpark in roast

[19:43] <jmerelo> tbrowder: it's generated in order all the same, but it does not use the file with the ordering and the additional generation step, just metadata at the top of each class.

[19:44] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: we do need that. I couldn't come up with one in such a short notice, but I'll happily take an issue and address it when I can...

[19:44] <tbrowder> i spent a lot of time enabling sorted documents within categories and think it’s worth configuring; otherwise, the items are a jumble

[19:44] <melezhik> one now can test their Raku modules against rakudo version using RakuDistAPI, I've just refined documentation - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist#testing-cpan-modules

[19:45] <jmerelo> tbrowder: the problem is that it took a huge chunk of the generation time. That intermediate step really killed it. 

[19:45] <melezhik> I also added ability to test modules hosted on GitHub

[19:45] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist#testing-github-projects

[19:45] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: hmm, S02-names/is-default.t definitely seems to imply spec, but i'm not finding anything more on-point...

[19:45] <jmerelo> tbrowder: I seem to remember that we managed to somehow respect order. Do check the new pages anyway, just in case, and if order is not correct, let's try to fix it. But within the current framework, please.

[19:46] *** stoned75 joined
[19:46] <TreyHarris> perhaps jnthn could chime in to help illuminate why the language shouldn't allow this

[19:58] <rypervenche> Is there a way to interpolate a variable inside of a <[ ]> for a regex matching? I've got set('!' .. '~') assigned to a variable $symbol and would like to be able to match a string against a character class using that range. Is this possible? Something like: $string ~~ / <[$symbol]> / but something that actually works.

[20:13] <chloekek> rypervenche: you can use <?{ … }> to check whether the match is an element of the set. See https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Regex_boolean_condition_check

[20:13] <chloekek> p6: my %symbol := set('!' .. '~'); say '!a~å' ~~ m:g/.<?{~$/ (elem) %symbol}>/

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 11a8d57f6: OUTPUT: «(｢!｣ ｢a｣ ｢~｣)␤»

[20:14] <rypervenche> chloekek: Awesome! I'll check that out.

[20:14] <MasterDuke> rypervenche: see https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/97 for some discussion about that exact thing

[20:16] *** squashable6 left
[20:16] <chloekek> rypervenche: I’m not quite sure how far $/ reaches inside that expression.

[20:17] <chloekek> E.g. whether it will be a two-character string if you have ..<?{ … }>.

[22:52] <tony-o> jnthn: is there any easy way to test where a validation is failing with cro/openapi?  the definition/2/anyOf bit is fine but if  you have 12k items in the list sifting through those to figure out which part of definition/2/anyOf isn't matching is a bit tedious

[23:17] <jnthn> tony-o: Hm, probably Schema::Validate or whatever the module is called needs to become rather better at its error reporting.
