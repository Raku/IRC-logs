[14:08] <guifa2> moritz: heh.  I'd be happy if we just got rid of it but alas, 'tis not the case

[14:10] <dakkar> nitpick: "saving", not "savings"

[14:10] <guifa2> I think tonight I'll be able to release this sucker, just have to finish the localtime->gmt conversion code.  I think the technique for hacking DateTime will be worthy of an interesting blog post (one of the many I've promised lizmat and still not finished lol).  

[14:10] <dakkar> it's a change to save (i.e. use more of) day time

[14:10] <dakkar> and of course I mangle my own explanation‚Ä¶

[14:10] <dakkar> it's a change to the local time, to save (i.e. use more of) daylight

[14:12] <dakkar> guifa2: I always forget to ask‚Ä¶ in Intl, is the current locale only stored in a process global?

[14:12] <dakkar> (I may have misunderstood completely, though)

[14:13] <guifa2> dakkar: for UserLanguage yes.  It's set once upon first use to avoid repeated shell calls.  

[14:13] <dakkar> so I can't use `Intl::UserLanguage` in (for example) web applications

[14:13] <guifa2> For all other modules, you can always specify a language, it just defaults to UserLanguage if you don't

[14:14] <dakkar> now that I've actually looked at the code, yes, UserLanguage is only useful for command-line things

[14:15] <guifa2> For a webapp, I'd load UserLanguage but specify a fallback language (English, probably, in most use cases) 

[14:15] <dakkar> for HTTP, I should construct a `LanguageTag` from `Accept-language` or equivalent

[14:15] <guifa2> Exactly.  And Intl::LanguageTag has tag selection functions

[14:16] <dakkar> thank you!

[14:20] <guifa2> dakkar: no problem.  Please let me know if you encounter any issues with any of them.  I haven't approached performance tuning though outside of trying to lazy load yet ‚Äî¬†for your web example, it will only load English until you get a Spanish user, then it'll have EN and ES loaded, until you get a German user, then EN ES DE, etc.

[14:20] *** Xliff left
[14:20] <dakkar> sounds sensible!

[14:21] <dakkar> I'm not sure if I'll actually get around to using it, but since I've seen other projects make serious mistakes, I'm happy to notice that you haven't made any that I recognise

[14:23] <guifa2> i'm sure in Timezone there will be one or two, but dealing with time, you basically tend to either load one of the hyper accurate Java libraries or you accept that there may be some minor issues without lots of boilerplate
