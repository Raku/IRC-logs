[00:24] <vrurg> I wonder if there is a way to make zef install only deps but skip their tests? zef install --deps-only --/test  actually doesn't install test dependencies of the module too resutling in later test failure.

[07:53] <moritz> two dots generate a Range, which has fast-path membership tests and the likes, but always assumes ascending order

[07:54] <moritz> three dots generate a sequence / lazy list / iterator thingy, with potentially any generator function

[13:45] <m_v_m> Hi all. I am just wondering...why tail of a one element array is equal to 'first' of the one element array?. In most know (to me) languages invoking 'tail' on [1] would return [] not 1. 

[13:46] <lizmat> tail gives the last element of a list

[13:46] *** upupbb-user3 left
[13:47] <lizmat> on a one element list, .head, .first and .tail give the same element

[13:48] <m_v_m> this is strange :)  In most know for me languages list could be pattern matched to [H | T] where H is the first element and T is the 'rest'. If there is a one element list then T would be nil or [] 

[13:49] <moritz> it seems Raku isn't most languages

[13:49] <m_v_m> I see. Is there any reason behind it?

[13:56] *** guifa joined
[13:59] <[Coke]> Something we could add to the docs if we have a xxxx-to-raku section for one of those languages.

[13:59] <moritz> m_v_m: the functional languages approach is not a very intuitive interpretation of "tail"

[14:00] <m_v_m> "not very intuitive" can you elaborate on that? 

[14:00] <moritz> ask a 5 year old where the tail of a queue of people is

[14:01] <moritz> and then ask them to point the 5 people at the tail of the queue

[14:01] <moritz> that's what an intuitive understanding of tail(5) is, IMHO

[14:01] <moritz> tail implies looking towards the end -- why it would count from the start, then?

[14:02] *** caterfxo left
[14:02] <m_v_m> In my opinion not :)  specially in moments when first and tail are returning the same thing. 

[14:02] <moritz> well, but you asked for my elaboration

[14:03] <m_v_m> true. Can I use something else which give me the same behaviour as a 'functional tail' without loosing performance? 

[14:04] <m_v_m> Raku is a very flexible language so probably there is a short solution for my problem :)

[14:45] <jnthn> Perhaps also misleading in so far as the underlying representation is very different

[14:51] *** devmikey joined
[14:56] <lizmat> would that matter ?

[14:56] <lizmat> isn't that an implementation detail ?

[14:56] <moritz> LISP people kinda expect cdr to be O(1)

[14:57] <timotimo> lists being immutable also allows sharing of pieces easily

[14:58] <timotimo> but yeah, O(n) for cdr would be quite a surprise

[14:58] *** rindolf joined
[14:58] <timotimo> if you literally port a piece of lisp code, it'll be using car and cdr liberally, i'd imagine, and the performance characteristics could be far worse?
