[06:50] <Xliff> MitarashiDango[m: Have you created an issue for it on the project site page? If not, would you mind doing so?

[06:51] <Xliff> Does sub MAIN support @-values?

[06:52] <Xliff> so if I "sub MAIN (:@value) { ... }" then I could ./script.raku --value=1 --value=2 --value=3

[06:52] <Xliff> And then have @values = (1, 2, 3)?

[06:57] *** dustinm` joined
[06:58] <moon-child> Xliff: not sure about that.  You can definitely do sub MAIN(*@values); ./script.raku 1 2 3

[06:59] <moon-child> Xliff: just tested; your syntax works

[21:34] <tyil> (I believe it was you who owned the server, if not, you can safely ignore)

[21:35] <rba> T

[21:35] <tellable6> 2020-10-19T14:11:30Z #raku-dev <patrickb> rba Can do. Though tyil should be on boat as well, as he currently creates star. Maybe it's automated already?

[21:35] <tellable6> 2020-10-19T14:14:41Z #raku-dev <patrickb> rba Also my next bigger raku project (moving our CI over to a custom tool that controls OBS and Azure) is still in the works, so I'd like to not get sidetracked too much...

[21:35] <rba> tyil: I don‘t own. I try to take care. All fine. 

[21:37] <rba> tyil: Good point. Let’s talk about rakudo star build for MacOS. 

[21:37] <tyil> well, I am *just* writing the email to perl6-users about the new GNU+Linux release

[21:37] <tyil> if you have time to build either the Windows or MacOS variant, and would like to do it, I can wait until tomorrow :>

[21:38] <rba> No, go ahead.

[21:38] <tyil> I haven't heard back yet from hankache, but I don't want to delay the release any further :(

[21:44] <tyil> sxmx: are you aware of the Raku Advent Calendar blog posts?

[21:47] <sxmx> Yes, I've been there. I haven't made my way through it yet though. It's just that Raku material is hard to find, but I really like the language

[21:48] <tyil> hmm, other than that, many Raku blogposts are gathered on the r/rakulang subreddit, if you use Reddit

[21:49] <sxmx> I do, it's pretty quiet there

[21:49] <tyil> yeah, I have to admit I haven't written anything about Raku lately either :(

[21:49] <tyil> my last post is over 3 months old by now :(

[21:50] <sxmx> where do you post? advent calendar?

[21:50] <tyil> https://www.tyil.nl/post/2020/07/15/config-3.0/ this is my latest Raku related post, but I've written 2 articles for the advent calendar too

[21:50] <tyil> on writing a grammar to parse Firefox' user.js

[21:51] <sxmx> cool, thanks I'll give it a look

[21:53] <rba> tyil: Is the process of building Win+MacOS star release still handcrafted?

[21:54] <tyil> the Windows part has some automation through PowerShell https://github.com/hankache/rakudo-star-win

[21:54] <tyil> MacOS would still be completely by hand, yes

[21:56] <rba> Got it. Went throug it in may. Are you going to do the builds or who is taking care of this?

[21:57] <tyil> I have no Windows or Mac machines, so I can't take care of it

[21:58] <rba> Who did it in the past though?

[21:58] <tyil> I've only tested for various GNU+Linux distros, and have some support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD users (as in, it seems to work in my clean VM, and it seems to work for users)

[21:58] <tyil> rba: hankache did

[22:09] <rba> tyil: Nice you made such a quick star release for Linux! I will see if I find time during the week to look into binary builds for Win+MacOS.

[22:09] <tyil> rba: it was quite slow from my PoV, I wanted one last month ;~;

[22:10] <tyil> but hopefully I can start following the "regular" release cycle again now

[22:10] <tyil> even if that means no immediate Windows release, I'd rather have a clear cycle for now

[22:16] <rba> tyil: With the src build the binary build should be automatable.

[22:17] <tyil> rba: for GNU+Linux, binary builds are automated, though I haven't publicly announced any of it yet, it's currently just for me to play around with

[22:17] <tyil> but I'm sure we can automate win+mac builds too

[22:17] <tyil> if it makes automation easier, I can try to incorporate the windows build files from hankache into my repo

[22:23] <rba> tyil: I think all should be around already. It's just about putting it togehter again in the correct order... (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml and https://github.com/hankache/rakudo-star-win/blob/master/build.ps1 ...)

[22:24] <tyil> I don't mind pushing to github for releases to trigger any pipelines

[22:26] <tyil> rba: if you want I can make the raku/rakudo-star repo on Github tomorrow and push there, then a MR can be opened to test such an Azure pipeline

[22:26] <tyil> and then it can be incorporated into the standard release procedure

[22:27] <rba> tyil: We should use https://github.com/rakudo/star 

[22:27] <tyil> I don't particularly mind, but note that I am not part of the Rakudo team, nor does my repo have the history of that repo

[22:30] <tyil> which eventual URL it ends up being doesn't matter much, it's just gonna be another URL for my `origin` remote

[22:33] <rba> tyil: Have you ever signed the https://www.perlfoundation.org/contributor-license-agreement.html ? 

[22:35] <tyil> I have not

[22:36] <tyil> Im going afk for a bit, as it is reaching time for me to sleep

[22:36] <rba> The easiest is to print/sign/scan and send it to coke and in the same mail ask moritz and/or jnthn to add you to the rakudo github org as a member.

[22:37] <tyil> I'll try to respond to anything tomorrow 

[22:37] <rba> tyil: sure let's see if I find time during the week... will reach out for you if I feel boring :-)

[22:37] <tyil> alright, thanks!

[22:37] <[Coke]> cla?

[22:37] <tyil> and good night :>

[22:37] <[Coke]> used to be a factoid. cc me, but there's a tpf email address it should go to

[22:41] <rba> [Coke]: tyil needs access to rakudo/star, so yes the cla. Is it still trademark|AT|perlfoundation.org ?
