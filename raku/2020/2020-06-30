[03:09] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> hey, I'm trying to use cro and cro stub http generated a project that's not booting

[03:09] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> it's telling me Failed to import resources/fake-tls/server-crt.pem as PEM/ASN1/PKCS12

[03:18] *** zacts left
[03:19] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> commenting out the tls argument and changing http from <1.1 2> to <2> to Cro::HTTP::Server.new fixed it, but now obviously I can't do HTTPS

[17:27] <eery> Hmm... what would the process look like to add another JIT target to MoarVM? Is everything sort of hardcoded to amd64 or could it support multiple archs

[17:31] *** bdju_ joined
[17:31] <timotimo> i think it's not very hardcoded, but i haven't looked closely yet

[17:31] *** bdju_ left
[17:34] <eery> fair enough. don't have the time or skill to work on that front but just curious how "easy" it would be, as "easy" as any JIT backend is to write

[17:35] <eery> performance seems pretty good without it at least

[17:35] <timotimo> true, spesh optimizes a bunch of stuff to better moar bytecode already and that's worth a lot

[17:37] <jnthn> There's really two JITs, a "lego JIT" which is the original one and is certainly quite attached to amd64, and an expression JIT, which is newer and in theory easier to port; currently it does what it knows how, but falls back to the lego JIT for things it doesn't know how to handle.

[17:37] <jnthn> The goal is to move fully over to the expression JIT, at which point porting should be a bit easier, though yeah, I don't think I'd ever describe it as "easy" :)

[17:38] <timotimo> true, and we just kind of lazily let a lot of stuff to the lego jit still

[17:38] *** rbt left
[17:39] *** rbt joined
[17:39] <timotimo> looking at some output from setting the MVM_SPESH_LOG environment variable to a filename and running a script

[17:39] <timotimo> can perhaps give you an idea of what the code that gets fed to the jit looks like

[17:39] *** squashable6 left
[17:40] <timotimo> the expr jit starts anew on every basic block, and in the spesh log you can see where the expr jit "bails" on each BB

[17:41] <timotimo> if there's no frames where there are no "expr jit bail" comments in them, then we're in a little spot of bother for this plan, but of course adding individual bits to the expr jit is possible

[17:41] *** squashable6 joined
[17:49] <eery> yeah I think I see how the JIT identifies blocks to compile, will have to run this on an x86 box to see what those jit logs look like

[17:50] <timotimo> yeah, MVM_JIT_DEBUG you mean?

[17:51] <eery> well, I thought the spesh logs also had references to the jit in them?

[17:51] <timotimo> that's right

[17:52] <timotimo> but it'll mostly be information on bailing out

[17:52] <timotimo> with jit debug also set you get more internal-ish dumps from the jit

[17:52] <eery> ah neat

[17:52] <timotimo> since the exprjit is based on expression trees and tiling, you'll be getting a DOT language dump of trees as well as a linear list of the "tiles"

[17:54] <eery> hmm, MVM_JIT_DEBUG?

[18:13] <timotimo> the graphviz file format

[18:15] <[Coke]> DOH.

[18:15] <[Coke]> thank you. :)

[18:16] <timotimo> that's the Department of Health tho

[18:18] <eery> I just realized while DOT has "of" in it the initialism for DH doesn't, and now that's gonna bother me

[18:19] <timotimo> but DH is Diffie-Hellman key exchange?

[20:37] <El_Che> the p5p perl7 thread is... interesting

[20:40] * lizmat has been unsubscribed from p5p for years now

[20:40] <lizmat> interesting in what sense ?

[20:43] *** xinming_ left
[20:44] *** xinming_ joined
[20:44] <El_Che> that there isn't much of a consensus on the what Perl 7 will be

[20:45] <moritz> my summary would be:

[20:45] <El_Che> dramatic pause

[20:45] <moritz> * most people agree that having some kind of version bump to 7 is a good thing

[20:46] <moritz> * most people are very worried about breaking backwards compat

[20:46] <moritz> * all people who mention the timeline do so in a "that's WAY too short" way

[20:47] <lizmat> yeah, changing a language is *HARD*

[20:47] <moritz> * the biggest point of contention seems to be how to deal with legacy code

[20:48] <El_Che> well, there is considerable group of people that considers eternal 5.8 support the most important issue

[20:48] <moritz> (with SaywerX basically saying "it's been holding us back, and non-mantainers aren't language contributors", and everybody else says CPAN is Perl's biggest strength, we cannot break that

[20:48] <El_Che> I don't see how you can reconcile that view with a Perl 7 as the rebirth of the maguage

[20:49] <El_Che> l

[20:49] <El_Che> lamg

[20:49] <El_Che> lang

[20:49] <moritz> :-)

[20:49] <El_Che> sorry

[20:49] <moritz> late here too

[20:49] <moritz> </summary>

[20:49] <moritz> I'm generally all in the "let's move forward" camp

[20:50] <El_Che> however, of Perl 7 is postponed for ever, or is just an bump keeping the status-quo, I don't think Perl could survive that

[20:50] <moritz> but I have no idea how much of the code that we use for $work (for example) has active maintainers

[20:50] <El_Che> old code will no disappear, but the brand will be completely dead for new development

[20:50] <El_Che> not

[20:51] <El_Che> damn I am a crappy blind typist

[20:51] <El_Che> (moving from azerty yo qwerty)

[20:51] <moritz> and then we'd need a better way to bring it to p7 compat than becoming the new maintainer on PAUSE, which is a lengthy, arduous process

[20:52] <rypervenche> I find it rather shocking (although I really shouldn't) how many people on Twitter who haven't kept up with either Perl or Raku immediately think "Ahh, Perl 7, so Perl 6 failed"

[20:52] <El_Che> we're Raku now, so the bad rep is actually directed at Perl

[20:53] <El_Che> (not really fair)

[20:53] * timotimo just saw "syntactic vinegar" for the first time

[20:53] <El_Che> moritz: I think CPAN is a double edged sword for Perl

[20:54] <rypervenche> Although reading through some of the social media, it's still amazing to see just how much work Liz is doing out there.

[20:54] <El_Che> if the code rot starts to spread faster than new code while forcing modules author to write compatible code with ancient perl releases... not a good place to be

[20:55] <El_Che> rypervenche: If I didn't know lizmat IRL, I would suspect she's a powerfull AI ;)

[20:55] <kawaii> rypervenche: ahhhh you make me search 'perl6' on Twitter and I only managed to read maybe 2 or 3 Tweets before I was forced to close the browser window.

[20:55] <kawaii> are people really like this?

[20:56] <lizmat> hmmm...

[20:56] <hobbs> there's pretty much nothing worse than people

[20:56] *** rindolf left
[20:58] <timotimo> always the loud minority that you're seeing

[20:58] <El_Che> "I don't think the defaults for .pl, .pm, or non-extension files can change.

[20:58] <El_Che> However, .pl7 and .pm7 files could default to perl 7 features. Hopefully

[20:58] <El_Che> including warnings."

[21:04] <El_Che> to be honest, after reading somne of the thread (the list UI is terrible), I fear for immobility and a mishmash of both the perl5->6 AND python2->3 transitions :(
