[08:58] <gfldex> Also I had to rename my blog for which I blame lizmat.

[08:59] <lizmat> blame taken

[08:59] <lizmat> weekly: https://gfldex.wordpress.com/2020/05/14/autorotating-logs/

[08:59] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[09:00] <gfldex> It took me 10 minutes to shoehorn a "6" into the vim command. :)

[09:01] <lizmat> gfldex: s/convicing/convincing/

[09:03] <lizmat> like the @siblings¬ª.Str.sort.skip.head($max-backlog - 1).reverse

[09:04] <gfldex> Without that it was more then 60 lines. So from a productivity standpoint it might not be the best solution.

[09:05] <MasterDuke> gfldex: have you any experience with zstd? i've completely switched away from gzip to it. faster compression, faster decompression, better ratio

[09:05] <lizmat> well, @siblings.map(*.Str) may be faster

[09:06] <gfldex> MasterDuke: I use zstd to compress the images of my windows box. But for logfiles .gz is better because of zless.

[09:07] <MasterDuke> ah

[09:07] <MasterDuke> what about @siblings.sort(*.Str)?

[09:08] <gfldex> lizmat: I leave the optimisations to the compiler. It will always be better at that job then me.

[09:08] <MasterDuke> gfldex: i wasn't aware of it before, but i just checked and i have a zstdless on my system

[09:09] <lizmat> MasterDuke: good point about sort(*.Str)

[09:09] <gfldex> given that you can and should put /var/log into it's own partition you could leave the compression to the filesystem.

[09:09] <MasterDuke> yeah, a couple now support zstd natively

[12:04] <moritz> mahafyi: I'm glade you like it. Personally, I'm more proud of some of the later chapters :-)

[12:05] <moritz> mahafyi: also, a (very short) review and rating and amazon would help immensely to sell more copies

[12:05] <mahafyi> I purchased in apress...

[12:05] <El_Che> lizmat: yes, of course, but it's a good answer about the "the admin needs to install it" argument

[12:05] *** MasterDuke joined
[12:06] <El_Che> lizmat: and it's about the compiled runtime, not a virtual env like setup that compiles it in your home

[12:07] <moritz> mahafyi: I think you can still write an amazon review, it just won't be labeled as "verified purchase"

[12:08] <mahafyi> Oh i see, very well, definitely deserves great reviews.

[12:14] <mahafyi> no, thank you, since i am actually able to read the regex examples of others also, you can be sure the book works, lol.

[12:17] <mahafyi> Many amazon kindle books are readable only on my android phone, which i don't, some are not supported in cloud ready no idea why.

[12:25] <tadzik> it sucks that most books aren't even legally buyable outside of DRM stores :/

[12:26] <El_Che> not for the DRM, but for having epub that can be read everywhere

[12:26] <moritz> the apress books are at least available as watermarked PDF

[12:26] <El_Che> I used to buy O'reilly pdfs directly from them

[12:26] <moritz> DRM free

[15:10] <rba> melezhik2: What is the difference of Blin and RakuDist?

[15:10] *** stoned75 joined
[15:10] <melezhik2> cc AlexDaniel`

[15:11] *** brtastic joined
[15:11] <rba> Might make sence you use the same host as we run Blin?

[15:11] *** mowcat joined
[15:12] *** jjmerelo joined
[15:13] <melezhik2> it's hard to say. but blin and rakudist are different . rakudist would run tests for Raku Modules on docker containers. 

[15:16] <AlexDaniel`> rba: well, Blin was designed for Rakudo release prep, and it works perfectly for that

[15:16] *** poohman joined
[15:16] <rba> When does it run on RakuDist? What is the trigger?

[15:17] <AlexDaniel`> I guess melezhik2 can tell more about possible uses for RakuDist, but it is far from being a replacement for Blin

[15:18] <melezhik2> +1

[15:18] <AlexDaniel`> so both projects are kinda similar but completely different :)

[15:18] <melezhik2> here is documentation - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist , but it'd make more sense when I spin up a web UI and you could play with that

[15:22] <rba> melezhik2: let me know when you spinned up the UI. Like to have a look. 

[15:22] <AlexDaniel`> rba: my understanding is that module authors, users, devs, etc. can trigger builds on specific configurations (different containers, different rakudo versions)

[15:22] <AlexDaniel`> rba: like Travis but not Travis! :)

[15:23] <melezhik2> AlexDaniel` that is correct

[15:24] <melezhik2> but for the nearest future the "killer" feature is users can run _simultaneously_ in one click tests for their shiny modules on variety of Rakudo versions

[15:25] <AlexDaniel`> in some way it's a bit weird that different people are working on all these somewhat different (but too similar) solutions, maybe it'd be nice to have some coordination

[15:26] *** hacktor left
[15:26] <AlexDaniel`> Zoffix made Toaster, I reimagined it with Blin, nine is doing something with open build service, melezhik is working on RakuDist

[15:27] *** __jrjsmrtn__ joined
[15:28] <AlexDaniel`> then there's also robertle with shelve6 and chloekek with CRAI. These are different, but maybe they should be integrated somewhat

[15:28] *** _jrjsmrtn left
[15:30] <AlexDaniel`> I didn't make it any nicer also, Blin and Bisectable are almost exactly the same, but at least they share a lot of code via Whateverable so that makes me feel a bit better about it x)

[15:34] <chloekek> But CRAI is still running. :)

[15:39] <AlexDaniel`> chloekek: what are you up to nowadays?

[15:39] <chloekek> Playing with OpenSCAD

[15:39] <chloekek> Want to make a case for my home theatre (RPi + HDD).

[15:40] <AlexDaniel`> oh, it's maintained again

[15:40] <[Coke]> can someone run 'cro stub' for me and make a gist with the created files?

[15:40] <AlexDaniel`> nice

[15:41] <rba> melezhik2: Let's go ahead and let me know if you're able to use AWS. In case resource (cost) is getting high we move to the Blin box.

[15:41] <[Coke]> (when I run cro, I get an "Abort Trap" - going to use docker going forward, but will be helpful to have a stub app to start with

[15:44] <chloekek> Also been doing more with Rust and Haskell

[15:45] <AlexDaniel`> chloekek: the learning curve was a bit steeper for me compared to openscad, but once you get the basics it's pretty cool

[15:46] <melezhik2> rba sure, thing 

[15:46] <chloekek> And been learning biology

[15:46] <AlexDaniel`> oh and IIRC there is a workbench for openscad too, so you can probably use both at the same time üôÇ

[16:00] <AlexDaniel`> chloekek: If you want to try FreeCAD, I do recommend to start with tutorials first, it never clicked for me otherwise. It's different from openscad. You can still use just boolean operations, but you'd be missing out on some cool things

[16:01] <AlexDaniel`> chloekek: I think these videos were the ones that helped me a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEvhclR4-o&list=PL6fZ68Cq3L8k0JhxnIVjZQN26cn9idJrj

[16:01] <chloekek> Solvespace is also pretty nice.

[16:02] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel`: maybe just "cro stub" works.

[17:58] *** jjmerelo joined
[17:58] <colomon_> ‚ÄúRaku SDK is not set for the project‚Äù

[18:02] <colomon_> okay, have that sorted

[18:02] <colomon_> now it‚Äôs complaining it cannot find the lib files I‚Äôm trying to debug.

[18:02] <colomon_> Does -Ilib still work?

[18:04] <moritz> yes

[18:09] <colomon_> moritz++

[18:09] <colomon_> How do I set a breakpoint?

[18:14] *** melezhik joined
[18:17] <moritz> not much of an IDE user myself, but usually you can right-click a bar next to the code

[18:18] <moritz> colomon_: maybe https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Using_Breakpoints.html# might help?

[18:19] <moritz> iirc Comma is built on the jetbrains IDE stuff, so I hope their documentation applies

[18:21] <colomon_> oh

[18:21] <colomon_> I guess I can‚Äôt set a breakpoint in a library?

[18:21] <colomon_> the things I‚Äôve been trying for the last ten minutes work great in the main script

[18:22] <[Coke]> ... this shouldn't matter, but does adding a "no precompilation;" in your module make the problem go away?\

[18:22] <colomon_> where in module?

[18:23] <[Coke]> first line

[18:24] <[Coke]> (precomp is one of the big differences between a script and a module, so just wanted to rule it out)

[18:25] *** Altai-man_ joined
[18:25] <colomon_> first line after use v6?  comma complains otherwise

[20:01] <El_Che> It's probably the only desktop java app that does the "run anywhere" acceptably :)

[20:11] <poohman> Hi MasterDuke - I just came to know that I was trying to invent the wheel by writing a grammar for the split method 

[20:11] <poohman> just for curiosity - where is the source code for the split function?

[20:12] <poohman> I was having trouble at the beginning and end of the string - so would like to have a look

[21:04] <tigerpaws> Hi, everyone. I was wondering how I could be of some use to the raku community. I've taken a lot of data science courses lately, and wondered if there is any interest in implementing a raku api to tensorflow, for example? Or maybe something else. 

[21:05] <lizmat> tigerpaws: an interface to tensorflow would be brilliant   :-)

[21:05] <lizmat> ++tigerpaws 

[21:06] <tigerpaws> From what I can see, and please correct me if I'm wrong, we don't have any interfaces to data science/ML stuff, or and DevOps stuff either, for that matter. 

[21:06] <lizmat> what projects are you thinking about ?

[21:08] <tigerpaws> I'm not really sure what's already there, but I was thinking about getting something like the numpy/pandas/seaborn stuff, maybe, even if it's an interface into the python library, or some devops stuff, like kubernetes api, docker/podman api, stuff like that. 

[21:09] <lizmat> well, there's Inline::Python, maybe that could be helpful

[21:11] <tigerpaws> Unless I'm mistaken, we're a little short on the scientific stuff, so that might be an area that needs some beefing up.  And yes, going through Inline::Python might be a solution, at least for a first cut. 

[21:11] <tigerpaws> What do you see that needs beefing up? 

[21:12] <tigerpaws> But I'm willing to try tensorflow, that would be a big project, but I'm retired, so I'm free, unless somebody comes calling. 

[21:14] * lizmat was thinking about doing a tensorflow interface, but is too busy with too many other things, even though retired  :-)

[21:15] <tigerpaws> lizmat: in that case, I think I'll try tensorflow and see how far I can get.  If I get stuck, maybe I can ask for some advice....

[21:16] <lizmat> sure... there'll be people here willing to help you with such a nice project!

[21:16] <lizmat> I know I will :-)

[21:17] <tigerpaws> Ok, Unless something drastic happens, I'm starting on that. Where do I do to start writing public modules for raku? 

[21:23] <El_Che> is it possible to use GENERATE-USAGE and the like from an other file than where the MAIN is situated? my tests say no :) is PROCESS:: something an option?

[21:24] <guifa2_> timotimo lizmat poohman: I'm late to the party but ‚Ä¶¬†Intl::Numbers has / will have (can't remember if it's been in oen of the released versions) a token that handles numbers like poohman wanted. <local-number> and optionally takes an argument for the language (so that 10,3 in French == 10.3 in English == Ÿ°Ÿ†Ÿ´Ÿ£ in Arabic

[21:25] <lizmat> tigerpaws: personally I use App::Mi6, installable with zef

[21:25] <lizmat> tigerpaws: do you have a PAUSE account ?

[21:25] <tigerpaws> Ok, I'll have a look at that. What is a PAUSE account? 

[21:26] <tigerpaws> I have github, gitlab and bitbucket accounts... 

[21:26] <El_Che> lizmat: doesn't it work with github?

[21:27] <lizmat> App::Mi6 ?

[21:27] <lizmat> not sure

[21:27] <lizmat> tigerpaws: a PAUSE account is an account to upload to CPAN

[21:29] <tigerpaws> no, i don't have that.  I'll have to see about that. Then I'll check out APP::Mi6
