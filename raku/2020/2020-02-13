[12:18] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Uzu (0.3.5) by 03SACOMO

[12:24] <abraxxa> what's the best construct to descend a directory and put all file IO objects into two arrays based on their name and included directory?

[12:25] <abraxxa> I have one solution using gather/take but now need to fill a second list

[12:27] <abraxxa> I'd just use a regular while loop without gather/take and push to the two arrays

[12:59] <moritz> so, do it?

[13:00] <moritz> you can do something like

[13:00] <moritz> sub traverse($dir) { my (@f1, @f2); my sub inner($dir) { ... }; inner($dir); return @f1, @f2 }

[13:00] <moritz> where inner() recurses and fills @f1 and @f2

[16:04] * dakkar should probably release that module

[17:40] <xinming> In this example, Should the Int() part be usable?

[17:42] *** reach_satori joined
[17:42] <lizmat> I think xinming has found a bug:

[17:42] <lizmat> m: my (Int $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":")

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´Type check failed in assignment to $a; expected Int but got Str ("42")‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[17:42] <lizmat> m: my (Int(Str) $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":")

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: ( no output )

[17:42] <lizmat> m: my (Int(Str) $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":"); dd $a

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´Str $a = "42"‚ê§¬ª

[17:42] <lizmat> m: my (Int(Str) $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":"); dd $a; $a = "foo"

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´Str $a = "42"‚ê§¬ª

[17:42] <xinming> lizmat: So, This is a bug, right?

[17:43] <lizmat> m: my (Int(Str) $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":"); dd $a; $a = "foo"; dd $a

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´Str $a = "42"‚ê§Str $a = "foo"‚ê§¬ª

[17:43] <xinming> the my Int() $x = "3"; should work as expected.

[17:43] <lizmat> yeah, or a NYI

[17:43] <xinming> Got it, thanks, it's just confirmation for this.

[17:43] <xinming> will add a issue

[17:43] <lizmat> thanks!

[17:43] <lizmat> bisectable6: my (Int(Str) $a, $b) = "42:b".split(":"); dd $a

[17:43] <bisectable6> lizmat, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=5685648) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[17:43] <bisectable6> lizmat, Output on both points: ¬´Str $a = "42"‚ê§¬ª

[17:44] <lizmat> looks like it has been there like forever  :-)

[17:44] <xinming> lizmat: BTW, when we use  my (Int() $a)     Will this declare the $a as Int?

[17:44] <xinming> or, it's scalar, Just store the value Int in it.

[17:45] <lizmat> m: my Int() $a; $a = "42"; dd $a

[17:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Coercion Int(Any) is insufficiently type-like to qualify a variable‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3my Int() $a7‚èè5; $a = "42"; dd $a‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        constraint‚ê§¬ª

[17:45] <lizmat> looks like it should at least create a similar error

[17:45] <xinming> So, the    my Int() $a     is an error

[17:45] <lizmat> yeah...

[17:46] <lizmat> so my (Int() $a, $b) should also be

[17:46] <xinming> Got it, I thought that we can save a step further to coerce things directly for newly created var

[17:47] <lizmat> yeah, that would be cool, but apparently we're not there yet  :-)
