[11:24] <holyghost> I'm writing a paper about theorem proving delmiters (e.g. in cutting text), I will post it in a few weeks

[11:24] <holyghost> It can be used in raku, but it's rather heavyweight

[11:25] <holyghost> basically you prove who to cut up text (which delmiters get used)

[11:25] <holyghost> s/who/how

[11:25] <holyghost> It uses a theorem prover :-)

[11:28] <holyghost> The program in scheme is getting near its end

[11:36] <holyghost> see the split perl function

[11:39] <holyghost> I've done a delimiter theory with a minimax, but now I need to start on types on the ALU theorem prover

[11:39] <holyghost> ALU = Arithmetic and Logical Unit

[11:40] <holyghost> e.g. a iterator type for searching in a file

[11:40] *** patrickb joined
[11:40] <holyghost> this will all be directed to the theorem prover

[11:41] <holyghost> a partial grep is also an example

[11:43] <holyghost> so e.g. in a theorem prover you can use f : x -> x + n for searching, where f is a function type

[11:43] <holyghost> that's the easiest way to do it, also a fast way

[11:45] <holyghost> x + n <= file-length etc.

[11:48] <holyghost> It's just another encapsulation of a search, in this case

[11:58] <holyghost> The only thing I need to factualize is a good theory for it

[12:02] <tbrowder> hi, can any math expert speak to what raku type would best be used for a key in an avl tree (or any tree for that matter). easy way is untyped Str but it fails when using two-plus digit ints for keys.nNumStr seems ideal but not as easy to implement.

[12:07] *** vike left
[12:09] <JJMerelo> tbrowder can you ellaborate a bit furhter? What fails with Str?

[12:11] *** vike joined
[12:11] <tbrowder> you have to use my AVL-Tree to see in its testing. i can use bare ints as keys until i get to 10. it inserts ok but when searching for it as a key i get an error about int as a key

[12:13] <tbrowder> the current implementation has an untyped key with default '' value for a new node.

[12:14] <tbrowder> i have started trying to use NumStr type for key but not sure it's worth the effort yet.

[12:16] <tbrowder> so far i've found no real definition of a type for keys in the binary tree description at rosetta code or wikipedia

[22:02] <[Coke]> first pass at https://gist.github.com/coke/386bc41e5a85f733730593e682540e73 - comments welcome

[22:03] <[Coke]> Not a huge article, but it was more of a meta RFC than one heavy on details.

[22:06] <[Coke]> eh. just moved it to the final location

[22:06] * [Coke] hurls https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/20th/articles/rfc28.md if folks want to comment

[22:10] <tobs> difficult topic though

[22:12] <[Coke]> anyone know how to use markdown to edit the article on wordpress?

[22:12] <[Coke]> I wouldn't have written it in markdown if I had thought it would be this painful to post. :)

[22:15] <tobs> "are known at compiler time" -- "compile time"?

[22:17] <tobs> as for markdown, I converted my .md file to .html with the tools/p6advent-md2html.p6 script. Necessary only for syntax highlighting though.

[22:18] <[Coke]> .tell jjmerelo committed rfc28, created a placeholder in wordpress... unable to figure out how to paste in markdown.

[22:18] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[22:20] <[Coke]> tobs: any idea how to invoke it with a local file?

[22:21] <tobs> ah, sadly no. IIRC it scrapes the HTML generated by github, so needs a gist.

[22:21] <[Coke]> so, did that... "abort trap 6"

[22:22] <[Coke]> .tell jjmerelo - ok, figured out how, but when I run the tool, I get 'abort trap 6', presumably related my old "one of cro's deps doesn't work on the mac" problem. I leave it to you to post the article.

[22:22] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[22:38] * sena_kun writes an article right now

[22:39] <sena_kun> [Coke], I think you won't be too sad to see your article to be re-scheduled to a later date?

[22:40] <tbrowder> article: i like it, and it highlights some reasons why it should replace python as a first language: gradual typing plus c-like blocks, etc,
