[18:46] <AlexDaniel> hsmyers: sorry, what do you mean?

[18:48] <hsmyers> DateTime returns TZ as offset, I need that converted to name like -7 = MST or American/Denver etc.

[18:49] *** mowcat left
[18:59] <AlexDaniel> hsmyers: and you want to create a module for that?

[19:00] <hsmyers> Was hoping to find one, I know it is a bit problematic going back and forth, but I jst need from numeric to text…

[19:01] <hsmyers> but thinking on it, any reasonable range would necessitate a module just to keep it out of in-line
