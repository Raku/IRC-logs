[04:00] <moon-child> how do I define my own metaoperator?  I can't find any docs (except for a 15-year-old mailing list post)

[04:02] <elcaro> moon-child: I don't think it's supported... at least not currently

[04:02] <elcaro> If I recall... I think I know this from a talk Larry gave at a Racket conf. The vid's on YouTube

[04:03] <elcaro> pretty sure at the end, someone asks if one can define their own meta-operators, and Larry says something along the lines of "not yet"

[04:03] <moon-child> elcaro: ok

[04:03] <moon-child> shame.  I was hoping it would be possible to implement (most of) apl inside raku

[04:18] <elcaro> regarding your earlier question.. this works, though I dunno if it's the best way

[11:08] <MasterDuke> set MVM_COVERAGE_LOG=foo-%p.log (or %d maybe, it creates a per-pid file)

[11:09] *** holli__ joined
[11:10] <MasterDuke> you can also use MVM_COVERAGECONTROL=1 and then `nqp::coveragecontrol(1); nqp::coveragecontrol(0);` to start and stop it where you want in your code

[11:34] <poohman> not a lot of people at #comma - just one

[11:35] <MasterDuke> well, sena_kun, jnthn, and timotimo can probably help, they're comma devs

[11:35] <sena_kun> poohman, no specific channel, anything I can be helpful with?

[11:36] <poohman> Just did a Comma update and have in Tools an option calle XML options

[11:36] <poohman> im working with XML libraries for the past few days

[11:36] <poohman> and the options there seem tailor made for what Im trying to do

[11:36] <poohman> but they are greyed out

[11:37] <sena_kun> poohman, did it work before this release?

[11:37] <poohman> I did not notice

[11:38] <poohman> just happened to notice it when I tried to check the Grammar Preview as it is in the same menu

[11:41] <sena_kun> poohman, indeed, seeing them. Ok, I'll create a ticket to look into why they are not active, shouldn't be too hard to fix it next release.

[11:42] <poohman> thanks

[11:42] <sena_kun> poohman, ticket created, will work on it. Thanks for reporting!

[12:06] <tbrowder> can comma be used to debug rakudo/rakudo/src/Perl6 code during a build?

[12:07] <ShimmerFairy> Depends on how good it is at NQP (or grammars if that's all you need, since NQP and Raku grammars are pretty much the same), I'd imagine.

[12:22] <lucs> Grammar with proto`s question: https://gist.github.com/lucs/b6b5e77126b895512dacd4bc02a2b498

[12:27] <ShimmerFairy> lucs: the usual strategy, which you can find being done in Raku's grammar, is to bring that out into a separate rule, so things look like elem:sym<let> { <let> } ... ld { <let> <dig> }

[12:27] *** Altai-man_ joined
[12:28] <ShimmerFairy> Maybe <elem:sym<let>> could work, but I wouldn't count on it.

[12:29] <lucs> ShimmerFairy: Trying...

[12:30] *** sena_kun left
[12:34] <lucs> ShimmerFairy: Interestingly, both approaches work.

[12:34] <lucs> Thanks

[12:35] <ShimmerFairy> I'd factor it out anyway, since needing the same regex in two places is usually a sign it should be put in a separate rule (like with regular code and functions) :)

[12:36] <lucs> I'll have to see how I handle associated actions -- as you can guess, I golfed this down from some real code I'm trying to build.

[12:41] <lucs> By the way, I'd say the regex was already factored outr; your first suggested approach factors out its name -- the second one lets me reuse the name, but yeah, it looks a bit heavy.
