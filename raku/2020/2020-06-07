[09:09] <bartolin_> JJMerelo: a quick question: I've stumpled upon the variable names in this example for number context https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/d77197925d/doc/Language/contexts.pod6#L69-L71. My mind insisted 'but these are strings'. Wouldn't changing the variable names to $not-a-number and $neither-a-number make the example clearer? (You've added the example, so I'm asking. I could do the change.)

[15:05] <RaycatWhoDat> Got it, thanks again. Totally forgot twigils are a thing.

[15:07] <RaycatWhoDat> So, another thing I'm kinda hoping to get out of this foray into a language is a better understanding of how to be a computer scientist. I've been coding for 10ish years but I seem to be falling short in several deeper conversations about algorithms or data science or what have you. I can understand it in context but I'm having trouble articulating approaches and such.

[15:08] <RaycatWhoDat> Y'all wouldn't happen to have any reading material or pointers for that, would ya?

[15:14] <El_Che> RaycatWhoDat: as matter of fact, I do, met look for the url

[15:14] <El_Che> https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/

[15:14] <El_Che> you can buy the book, or download the pdf for free

[15:15] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh! Nice.

[15:15] <El_Che> if you have programming experience, you can go faster through the book, but it shows some concepts that are good to know

[15:16] <El_Che> algorhythm and CS book don't need to be language specific if you want to dig deeoer

[15:16] <El_Che> deper

[15:16] <El_Che> e

[15:16] <RaycatWhoDat> You tried.

[15:16] <RaycatWhoDat> xD

[15:16] <El_Che> and failed :)

[15:18] <RaycatWhoDat> That makes sense, though re: language-agnostic. Just bought that book. I'll give it a good read and see where my head's at after that.

[15:21] <RaycatWhoDat> Hmm.

[15:21] <lucs> suman: At what point does $x become different from 1? That's when the loop stops.

[15:21] <RaycatWhoDat> Doesn't the conditional get fulfilled immediately?

[15:21] <RaycatWhoDat> Ah, ninja'd by lucs

[15:21] <RaycatWhoDat> Might be looking for `while`.

[15:22] <lucs> suman: You got the logic backwards (who hasn't, many times (/me looks at himself))

[15:22] <RaycatWhoDat> lucs: I feel that on a spiritual level.

[15:22] <RaycatWhoDat> Coded myself into a box where the logic is all wrong and the variables don't matter

[15:23] <suman> My logic is start with 3 and not until x is 1 run the loop at the same time decrement x

[15:23] <lucs> m: my $x = 3; until $x == 1 {  say "hello";  $x = $x - 1;}

[15:24] <RaycatWhoDat> `until` is one of those keywords that feels where when it isn't postfix

[15:25] <RaycatWhoDat> weird*

[15:25] <suman> lucs You nailed it thank you

[15:25] <lucs> You're welcome.

[15:26] <lucs> I only use 'until' and 'unless' as postfix, otherwise I get confused :/

[15:26] <RaycatWhoDat> ^

[15:29] <lucs> ÔΩ¢actionÔΩ£ unless ÔΩ¢condÔΩ£  <--->  if ! ÔΩ¢condÔΩ£ { ÔΩ¢actionÔΩ£ }

[15:29] <lucs> ÔΩ¢actionÔΩ£ until ÔΩ¢condÔΩ£  <--->  while ! ÔΩ¢condÔΩ£ { ÔΩ¢actionÔΩ£ }

[15:31] *** suman left
[15:34] <phogg> I think this is because in English saying "Unless X then Y" is less common than saying "Y, unless X" and so the latter is more natural. Similarly you don't often see sentences starting with "Until," except certain stock phrases e.g. "Until next time" is normal but "Until we are finished we will keep working" is not.

[20:11] <rypervenche> Sorry for the notive question. I'm looking to have a subroutine run some rsync commands and have different rsync options for each src/dest. What would be the best data structure to have the src, dest, rsync options, etc for each sync that I need to do? I'm guessing maybe an array of hashes or hash of hashes, but I'm curious to know if there's a better way to structure it all. And how I might write it

[20:11] <rypervenche> well into my code.
