[12:49] <[ptc]> just wondering: is it possible to do an element-wise division (or multiplication for that matter) on an array?  Something like Matlab's `./` operator?

[12:50] <[ptc]> I haven't been able to find anything in the docs, so I thought I'd ask here :-)

[12:54] <[ptc]> m: ($_ / 10 for 1..11)

[12:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "/" in expression "$_ / 10" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[12:57] <[ptc]> m: (1..11) >>/>> 10

[12:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «Potential difficulties:␤    Useless use of >>/>> in sink context␤    at <tmp>:1␤    ------> 3(1..11) 7⏏5>>/>> 10␤»

[12:58] <[ptc]> menno

[12:58] <[ptc]> m: say((1..11) >>/>> 10)

[12:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1)␤»

[12:59] <[ptc]> ok, that seemed to work.  Is there a better/more elegant way to do the same thing?

[12:59] <[ptc]> i.e. could one do `(1..11)./10` ?

[13:00] <dakkar> m: say (1..11).map:*/10

[13:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Confused␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3say (1..11).map:7⏏5*/10␤    expecting any of:␤        colon pair␤»

[13:00] <dakkar> uh…

[13:00] <dakkar> m: say (1..11).map: */10

[13:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1)␤»

[13:01] <dakkar> (one day I'll remember that whitespace is sometimes significant in Raku…)

[13:01] <guifa> m: say 1..11 X/ 10

[13:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1)␤»

[13:02] <dakkar> oh, that's clever but I'd nix it in a code review

[13:02] <dakkar> too risky having a list-that's-accidentally-1-long

[13:03] <guifa> m: say (1,) X/ 10

[13:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(0.1)␤»

[13:03] <guifa> it works okay with one element lists

[13:03] <dakkar> [ptc]: how does Matlab's ./ operator behave when it's got arrays on both sides?

[13:04] <[ptc]> dakkar: iirc it divides each element by the respective element in the other array.  Hence it only works if the arrays are the same length.

[13:04] <dakkar> guifa: sorry, I meant that `10` is a 1-element list, and someone is going to make it `(1..10) X/ (10,11)

[13:04] <[ptc]> it's been a while since I've done matlab though

[13:05] <[ptc]> guifa: ooh, that's a nice solution!

[13:05] <guifa> dakkar: ah. yeah, that would then give different results

[13:05] <dakkar> for arrays of the same length:

[13:05] <dakkar> m: say (1..10) Z/ (11..20)

[13:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(0.090909 0.166667 0.230769 0.285714 0.333333 0.375 0.411765 0.444444 0.473684 0.5)␤»

[13:07] <[ptc]> dakkar: wow!  Thanks!  I was only intersted in the division by scalar case :-)  I like the generalisation too!

[13:07] <dakkar> explanation: X is the cross-product meta-op, Z is the "zip" meta op

[13:07] <dakkar> say <a b> X~ <c d>

[13:07] <evalable6> dakkar, rakudo-moar a26beb66e: OUTPUT: «(ac ad bc bd)␤»

[13:07] <dakkar> m:say <a b> Z~ <c d>

[13:07] <evalable6> dakkar, rakudo-moar a26beb66e: OUTPUT: «(ac bd)␤»

[13:08] *** squashable6 joined
[13:08] <[ptc]> cool, many thanks :-)

[13:09] <guifa> if it’s something you’re going to be using a lot, and you want really fine control (throw an error if a list of nonmatching sizes are used, etc), you could also define your own operator

[13:10] *** MasterDuke joined
[13:10] <guifa> m: sub infix:<./> (@a, @b where @a == @b || die "Each side must have the same number of elements" ) { @a Z/ @b }; say (2,4,6) ./ (1,2,3); say (2,4,6) ./ (1,2)

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «(2 2 2)␤Each side must have the same number of elements␤  in sub infix:<./> at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:11] <guifa> you could make it multi

[13:12] <guifa> so that you can handle Positional ./ Positional, and Positional ./ Numeric according to how matlab does

[13:12] <[ptc]> yeah, I'd thought of that.  Just wondered if there were something directly in the language and I'd just not spotted it in the docs

[20:55] <[Coke]> I remember asking this years ago but cannot find the ticket: do we have a way for raku to tell us what version of unicode we support?

[20:56] <[Coke]> also, how long has there been tab completion in the REPL? nifty

[20:58] <[Coke]> m: 3.fmt("0.3d") # bet we could improve the error message here by asking if they forgot a %

[20:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «Your printf-style directives specify 0 arguments, but 1 argument was supplied␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:59] <sena_kun> [Coke], I think lizmat has worked on printf, so can ping and ask.

[20:59] <[Coke]> (unicode) reminded by the thread on perl6-users

[21:00] <[Coke]> @lizmat: ^^ fmt question

[21:00] <MasterDuke> i thought unicode version might be in -V output, but i don't see it

[21:04] <[Coke]> Yah, might be nice to have it in -V output and also in a $* var.

[21:06] <El_Che> I thought tab completion was handled by external libs and progs?

[21:08] *** sena_kun left
[21:10] <[Coke]> Sure, it's probably readline or linenoise, but I didn't realize it was there

[21:31] <guifa> [Coke]: I actually believe most of the unicode stuff is in MoarVM rather than in Rakudo

[21:33] <[Coke]> ... Sure, but I only ever run moarvm through rakudo. :)

[22:11] <guifa`> El_Che: there's normally just one release a year, and the last one came out less than half a year ago

[22:11] <guifa`> CLDR is worse, two releases a year and less stability between releases

[22:46] <lizmat> [Coke]: re: 3.fmt("0.3d")   I guess we could warn at compile time that no actual format was specified

[22:47] <lizmat> and perhaps add a % at the end and see if that is a valid format

[22:47] <lizmat> in the error reporting

[22:48] *** aborazmeh left
[22:48] <lizmat> my work on sprintf now lives in the RakuAST branch, and is "live" there as it were

[22:48] <lizmat> PR's welcome    :-)
