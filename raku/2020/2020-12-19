[00:02] <leont> It not working was my own bug, but not being able to dd that regex made that hard to discover

[00:03] <moon-child> that's fair.  It would be nice if dd could actually deconstruct that regex

[17:46] <warriors> hi, what need to be done to add a discourse forum to the raku community, while i think the community is small and the forum will not be super active, i still think its a nice resource and place to ask questions, and keep history of questions and answer 

[17:46] <warriors> I asked in few other forums how they did it, and they all payed for the hosted option as 50% discount 

[17:46] <warriors> https://www.discourse.org/pricing

[17:46] <warriors> If we go for the standard plan, which i think will fit the size of the raku community its only 50$ per month

[17:46] <warriors> do you guys think this can be funded

[17:47] <warriors> rust, fsharp, julia, ocaml, go ... all have a discourse forum

[17:48] <warriors> and i find it really helpful 

[17:54] *** sjm_uk joined
[17:54] <Xliff> warriors: $100/month is super pricey.

[17:54] <warriors> for foss, we will pay only 50

[17:54] <Xliff> warriors: OK. Getting better.

[17:55] <warriors> we can always install on our own server 

[17:55] <Xliff> lizmat: What kind of traffic does the Weekly pull in?

[17:55] <warriors> but i think the admin cost outweight 50 per month

[17:55] <Xliff> I would pay that for a couple of months.. that's assuming the traffic is there.

[17:56] <warriors> well if we open the forum for also perl5/7 

[17:56] <warriors> the traffic will be there

[17:56] <warriors> i think

[17:56] <Xliff> Perl doesn't have a discourse, either?

[17:57] <warriors> but anyway, beside the price and traffic, i think a forum is nice, currently i ask here, but obviously this missing search, or on the facebook page

[17:57] <warriors> and the facebook page is not fun

[17:57] <warriors> if perl had a discourse, we should use it for raku too

[17:57] <warriors> perl and raku are still same familly of languages

[17:57] <Xliff> I agree. That's up to the their community, though.

[17:57] <Xliff> Yep. If only more ppl understood that.

[17:58] <warriors> and if the raku community fund a discourse forum i think it would be nice to open it for perl5/7

[17:58] <Xliff> warriors: If you are serious about this, write a call for discussion, here:

[17:58] <warriors> what is that

[17:58] <Xliff> https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving

[17:58] <Xliff> It's a better place for this type of discussion.

[17:59] <warriors> ok, will open an issue  there, i will collect some information first

[20:47] <Xliff> How can I load a core file in rakudo-gdb-m?

[20:48] <SmokeMachine> Is there anyway of doing this? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Xb8uUGSF/

[20:48] <Xliff> And what's the best way to report a segfault?

[20:49] <MasterDuke> Xliff: either rakudo or moarvm issue

[20:50] <Xliff> MasterDuke: And what's the best way to isolate one? ;)

[20:50] <linkable6> Link: https://docs.raku.org/type/Parameter

[20:50] <MasterDuke> Xliff: i believe a core file you'd just open in gdb directly, you wouldn't want to use rakudo-gdb-m

[20:51] <MasterDuke> Xliff: never let it visit its friends. not sure what you mean

[20:53] <Xliff> hah

[20:53] <Xliff> I mean: What's the best way to localize the segfault to the area of code that caused it.

[20:56] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[20:57] <MasterDuke> it helps if your moarvm is compiled with debugging symbols. catch it in gdb, get a c level backtrace, find the first frame with a `tc` as a parameter, `f <that frame number>`, then `call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)`

[20:59] <Xliff> Yeah. Unfortunately, this is a long runner. Can't afford the performance hit of gdb.

[20:59] <Xliff> Was hoping to catch the moarvm origin at least.

[20:59] <MasterDuke> gdb has almost no overhead

[20:59] <Xliff> No, but running moar code in rakudo-gdb-m DOES.

[21:00] <MasterDuke> huh, i've never really noticed that

[21:00] <Xliff> Yeah. Code is slower when running. Particularly parse time.

[21:01] <Xliff> And when you are talking between 10-20 minutes (randomly) per occurence when NOT running under gdb...

[21:01] <Xliff> That could be a long time.

[21:01] <MasterDuke> stick it in a loop overnight>

[21:01] <MasterDuke> ?

[21:03] <MasterDuke> for compiling the CORE.c setting i don't see any slowdown under gdb. but it also doesn't take 10-20min normally...

[21:04] <RaycatWhoDat> Quick question: what was the handle of the person who wrote a compiler in Raku?

[21:05] <Xliff> RaycatWhoDat: That could be several people.

[21:06] <RaycatWhoDat> Ah. Apologies. Andrew Shitov?

[21:07] <Xliff> Ah. That's the author I was about to post.

[21:08] <RaycatWhoDat> Before I go down that road, let me ask a simpler question

[21:08] <RaycatWhoDat> What's the state of standalone binaries in Raku? Is there a recommended way of doing that?

[21:11] <MasterDuke> RaycatWhoDat: for windows you might be able to use https://modules.raku.org/dist/App::InstallerMaker::WiX:github:Jonathan%20Worthington%20%3Cjonathan@edument.se%3E

[21:12] <MasterDuke> otherwise i think the work described in https://yakshavingcream.blogspot.com/ needs to be finished and/or polished

[21:13] <Xliff> Yep! MasterDuke++. I forgot what her nick was. 

[21:13] <RaycatWhoDat> Interesting.

[21:15] <RaycatWhoDat> I recall LOVE (Lua game framework) allowing for the creation of a "fused executable" by 'cat'-ing the source code onto the application. 

[21:16] <RaycatWhoDat> Is this an approach that is feasible in any sense (sans the obvious work involved)?

[22:33] *** aborazmeh left
[22:33] <MasterDuke> you need to push the changes and create a PR (pull request) from your fork/branch to master

[22:34] <Henri> Can I push directly to a branch I've created?

[22:34] <Henri> My branch is only local.

[22:35] <MasterDuke> you commit to a branch and push to a remote. did you fork the repo or just clone it?

[22:36] <MasterDuke> you might not have permissions to push your branch if you just cloned it. in that case you want to fork the repo, clone your fork, push your new branch to your fork, and then create a PR from your branch on your fork to the master branch of the main repo

[22:36] <Henri> I just cloned the repo.

[22:36] <Henri> Yes that seems to be the problem...

[22:37] <Henri> Got it.

[22:40] <MasterDuke> np

[22:40] <Henri> Right now it's very minimal. I'm just playing around with it for Bioinformatics tasks and adding common functionality I use.

[22:40] <Henri> Maybe it will eventually turn into a full-fledged API; we will see.
