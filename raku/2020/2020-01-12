[00:49] <Xliff> nine: Where is this unlinked? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationStore/File.pm6#L145

[00:58] *** mahmudov left
[01:05] <jnthn> Xliff: nine would know better, but my instinct would be that it would not want to be unlinked, since its creation is potentially race-y

[01:06] <jnthn> So it's probably created the first time the precomp store is created, and then is always there to lock on afterwards

[11:50] <sarna> SmokeMachine: I haven't. thanks :D

[11:51] <sarna> I can't install JSON::Tiny with zef, anyone has a similar problem? there's an issue on tiny's repo but.. https://github.com/moritz/json/issues/34 crickets so far

[11:54] *** sena_kun joined
[11:55] *** Altai-man_ left
[11:56] <moritz> sarna: I've commented on the issue

[11:56] <moritz> JSON::Tiny hasn't changed much in the past few months, so any breakages in installability are much more likely to come from rakudo or zef than from JSON::Tiny

[11:57] <sarna> weird, I've just got a new zef

[11:57] <moritz> in fact, the last commit was October 2017

[11:58] <sarna> my zef is v0.8.2

[11:58] <sarna> ....... I had to run "zef update"

[11:58] <sarna> gonna be sick

[12:02] <moritz> and does it work now?

[12:03] <sarna> yes :^)
