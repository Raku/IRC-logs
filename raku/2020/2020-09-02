[00:55] <interwebs> what usecases is raku good for?

[00:56] <interwebs> hopefully not too controversial to ask about, lest the answers are not "well any turing complete language can do anything"

[01:04] <rypervenche> interwebs: Hang around, people will answer :) Might take a little bit since it's night time.

[12:43] <kawaii> Are there any built-in tools for forming arrays from a list of words? I found `.words` which works for, well, single words, but I want to provide a list that could look like `test bark "apple pie

[12:43] <kawaii> ugh, carriage return 

[12:43] <kawaii> `test bark "apple pie" test2` and count the quoted word as it's own entry in the array

[12:52] <rypervenche> kawaii: And all of these words are on a single line?

[12:52] *** jmerelo left
[12:52] <kawaii> rypervenche: yes!

[12:54] <rypervenche> Don't know of anything built-in for that. I might either change the format of the line and put each "word" on its own line and then use .lines, or write a little grammar to do what you're wanting.

[15:48] *** sena_kun left
[15:49] <guifa> .comb(/['"' <( .* )> '"'] || \S+/); will get rid of your quotation marks

[15:59] <codesections> guifa: why do you prefer the regex comb to just the regex?  You get essentially the same list either way, right?

[16:00] <codesections> (with the only difference being that the regex gives you a list of matches rather than strings, but they trivially coerce to strings)

[16:01] <[Coke]> we have some    mac users here - anyyyy ideas wwwwwwwwhy typing on a    bt mac keyboard would sometimeand sometimes dupliccccccate keys? (be sloww/laggy was firsttttt)

[16:02] <[Coke]> it is haaaaappening rrrrrighhttttttttt      nooow

[16:02] <[Coke]> should probably just give up and get keyboardio

[16:04] <codesections> I've also been tempted to get a keyboardio -- I've heard good things

[16:04] <codesections> (and then you could be running linux on your keyboard, even if you aren't (yet!) using it on your computer :D)

[16:05] <guifa> codesections: if you use the regex, the matches are in a match object.  comb basically returns the equivalent of Match.list 

[16:06] <guifa> so, six half dozen? :-) 

[16:06] <codesections> (I'm also kind of tempted by this keyboard, though it could be too small and isn't out yet: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus)

[16:06] <codesections> guifa: fair enough; I was just curious 

[16:08] <guifa> Also, kawaii’s request reminds me of yet another that I can add into Intl at some point

[19:20] <gfldex> There are plenty of modules on cpan that got a META6.json inside the tar-ball without an auth field.

[20:06] <tbrowder> ref voting: i sure would like to have seven votes for seven seats!

[20:08] <tbrowder> what is the intent of voting for only 5 of the seven? statistical magic?

[20:10] <vrurg> tbrowder: I think it's an error, but let's accept things as they are for now or we risk another round of bikeshedding and losing time.

[20:10] <tbrowder> [Coke]: not trying to be disrespectful, just wondering.

[20:12] <tbrowder> just harder to pick...

[20:13] <lizmat> tbrowder: it's my fault for not having enough imagination :-(

[20:14] <lizmat> I do think we will get more than 7 people with at least 1 points, so in that sense there shouldn't be any problem

[20:14] <tbrowder> i only bet on a horse race one time. i gave a classmate $2 and picked a horse with long odds. he came back from a day at the track and gave me $2. ??? the horse bolted at the gate and all bets were off.

[20:14] <lizmat> :)

[20:15] <tbrowder> i hope i have better luck this time :)

[20:20] <tbrowder> for the next election we should be able to post support for our favorite candidates somewhere.

[20:20] <tbrowder> vote for X, 2 chickens in every pot!

[20:21] <lizmat> I'm already looking forward to that! :-)

[20:21] <codesections> tbrowder: why not do that for this election?  There's r/reddit, a personal blog, or the mailing list -- just to name a few ways to voice your opinions :)

[20:22] <tbrowder> hm, good idea

[20:23] <tbrowder> but the choices are do good i hesitate to do that

[20:23] <tbrowder> *so

[20:23] <codesections> Agreed

[21:11] <tbrowder> i understand, and i appreciate what you and the others are doing.

[21:17] <[Coke]> you're welcome. I'm only doing this one small thing. :)

[21:24] <tbrowder> well, wait till you start vote tallying, that'll be fun!
