[19:13] <Hermit> are there any docs on embedding a raku interpreter for use as an extension mechanism in another program

[19:16] <MasterDuke> Hermit: don't know that there are any docs, best bet is probably looking at Inline::Perl6

[19:17] <Hermit> I don't see the connection

[19:18] <Hermit> Oh, it embeds a MoarVM

[19:18] <guifa2> Or maybe by using the JS or JVM variants.  Although I know I'm terrible and don't test on those at all =\

[19:18] <Hermit> They're too slow I think

[19:19] <[Coke]> find myself wishing for a command line raku arg to say the result of the last calc.

[19:19] <[Coke]> raku -s '<maths>'

[19:19] <Hermit> it's surprisingly hard to find a scripting language that will make proper use of multiple cores

[19:20] <Hermit> raku would be perfect but there's no precedent for it being embedded into another program

[19:21] <MasterDuke> Hermit: nine is probably the best person to talk to

[19:22] <Doc_Holliwood> Made some improvements and put it in its own paragraph. https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Password_generator#Raku_.28functional.29

[19:22] <Doc_Holliwood> still open for suggestions

[19:23] *** erdic left
[19:23] <timotimo> you can look at moar's main.c and such to find out how to create an MVMInstance and initial MVMThreadContext

[19:23] <timotimo> after that, i would probably recommend doing IPC over Channel objects (aka async blocking queue) between host program and embedded moarvm

[19:23] *** erdic joined
[19:28] *** clarjon1 joined
[19:33] <MasterDuke> timotimo: can you craft some code where the jit bails completely because of param_op_i?

[19:35] *** melezhik left
[19:36] <timotimo> let's see

[19:37] <Hermit> thank you timotimo 

[19:37] <guifa2> are NQP-ish questions best asked here or on raku-dev or? 

[19:37] * guifa2 doesn't have any right now, but will soon

[19:38] <Hermit> I think I'd be comfortable looking at how the top level singleton objects are created and placing those in my program, compiling and linking issues aside

[19:38] <Hermit> I'm more worried about accessing script objects from c/c++ code since these are potentially in use in a multithreaded script

[19:39] <timotimo> first attempt didn't work

[19:40] <Hermit> There are likely good synchronization mechanisms for script<->script code in raku / moarvm but it would be a lot more complicated if I e.g. started a script in a thread that shared resources with a c++ program

[19:40] *** clarjon1 left
[19:40] <MasterDuke> timotimo: same here

[19:41] <timotimo> what do you need it for?

[19:43] <MasterDuke> trying to do https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/660 correctly

[19:45] *** clarjon1 joined
[19:47] <timotimo> as i understood it we were waiting for a whole refactor of args handling for those ops to get jitted

[19:48] <MasterDuke> i thought those were the param_on_* ones? but can you find that discussion? maybe i should just close the PR

[19:48] <timotimo> it's for all the optional ones i think?

[19:49] <MasterDuke> hm

[20:22] <MasterDuke> timotimo: interesting, my attempt does bail if i comment out https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/args.c#L358-L379

[20:23] <MasterDuke> so i have something i can test. but is the whole thing moot anyway?

[20:23] <timotimo> commenting it out doesn't sound like a good idea though?

[20:23] <timotimo> it has a break in its default, so it'll just act as if there weren't that op

[20:24] <timotimo> or perhaps the checks below that will bail it out

[20:24] <MasterDuke> i actually just added a break at line 363

[20:25] <timotimo> should have the same effect

[20:31] *** mowcat joined
[20:32] *** xinming left
[20:34] *** xinming joined
[20:35] <MasterDuke> but will it ever be the case that the op will really make it through without getting speshed? if so, i can use this hack to test. otherwise the jitting will be pointless

[20:37] <timotimo> when there's too many arguments, i think it'll skip arg speshing and let the args ops through?

[20:46] *** ckc joined
[20:51] <ckc> Good Day - newbie question: while working on Shitov's compiler tutorial, I'm having a simple problem.  How can I get 'use' to import .rakumod files located in the same directory as the code containing 'use'?  I do not wish to place them elsewhere.  

[20:51] *** andrzejku left
[20:55] <timotimo> you will need to either "use lib '.'" or give -I. on the commandline

[20:55] <timotimo> there's also a way to import by file path, but i forgot what it was

[21:06] *** kst left
[21:07] <ckc> Thanks; the correct directory is being checked, and the file LinguaAST.rakumod is present, the code includes 'use LinguaAST', but it still isn't being found.  Perhaps it's something to do with using Singularity shell (university won't allow a server install on short notice).  Probably too much to troubleshoot, I may just dump everything in one

[21:07] <ckc> file.  Love the language, though.

[21:10] <Grinnz> if . is interpreted as a relative path, note that it's relative to cwd - raku probably has a simpler way to get a file path relative to current file

[21:14] *** Altai-man_ joined
[21:16] *** sena_kun left
[21:17] <ckc> I'm puzzled because zef-installed modules work; my own .rakumod do not: "Could not find LinguaAST at line 221 in: file#/ilab/users/ckc14/cpl2".  I don't know what "file#" has to do with anything, but else the directory is correct.  This is using the command perl6 lingua.pl6 in the Singularity shell based on a Singularity Docker Rakudo Star import.

[21:17] <ckc> Probably not a typical use case.

[21:20] <AlexDaniel> ckc: do you have a META6.json file?

[21:21] <AlexDaniel> ckc: if not, then it's possible that your rakudo is too old and it simply doesn't know about .rakumod extension yet

[21:21] <AlexDaniel> but if you use a META6.json file then it doesn't matter

[21:21] <ckc> I do not.  Is there a template you could point me to?

[21:23] <AlexDaniel> ckc: https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Preparing_the_module

[21:23] <AlexDaniel> ckc: ‚ÄúMake your META6.json file look something like this:‚Äù

[21:35] <ckc> Thanks!  That did it.  I would not have found that anytime soon.

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> me too

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> I don't think we recommend .rakumod yet, exactly for that reason

[21:43] *** pilne joined
[21:49] <ckc> I'm just starting in Raku, but my first reaction is delight.   Makes Python seem like a straitjacket.  If I could figure out how to get Raku to generate Python code for Pandas and Matplotlib I'd be thrilled - summer project, perhaps, if someone hasn't done it already.

[21:52] <moritz> ckc: are you aware of Inline::Python?

[21:53] <moritz> I've actually included an example of using matplotlib in the "Perl 6 Fundamentals" book

[21:53] <moritz> there's a branch of Python 3 support in the Inline::Python repo; not quite finished yet :/

[21:56] <ckc> At the moment I'm just trying to get through finals - compilers, computability, neural nets - will have spare time in a few weeks!  I'll definitely look into your book.  Any est delivery date on the Py3 Inline? 

[21:56] <moritz> not really; currently distracted by work, family and a global pandemic

[22:03] *** pmurias left
[22:04] <ckc> This is probably idle speculation, but if Raku has fundamental support for parallelism in a way Python doesn't, and if it were quite easy to parallelize Python data science programs via Py3 Inline or some other means, I expect there'd be interested users.  Perhaps Raku could serve to tie together the various data science tools.

[22:05] *** vike left
[22:05] <ckc> Everyone's got ideas for what other people should spend their time working on, of course.

[22:06] <lizmat> ckc: too bad you missed this round: https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/gc_cp_mar_2020

[22:07] <lizmat> perhaps the next round you could do a grant proposal for getting Python 3 support in ?

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> that'd be awesome

[22:08] <lizmat> ckc: just a hint  :-)

[22:09] *** vike joined
[22:10] <ckc> I'd make out the check to moritz.  Glad to know the organization is sponsoring development of the language; I'm definitely looking forward to learning it.  Anyway, thanks all, and I'm off to dinner with my own two little boys, ciao.
