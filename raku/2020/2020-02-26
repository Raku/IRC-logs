[10:59] <Altreus> lizmat: Is there a value I can give to a slack to "unset" it so the slack runs again? Or would I have to provide a method on the object to set a new slack?

[11:21] <Altreus> of course :thinking: is not a uniname

[11:21] <Altreus> But surely it is part of some list somewhere?

[12:00] <Altreus> is it necessary to =end pod on the last line of a file?

[12:02] *** titsuki joined
[12:04] *** Doc_Holliwould left
[12:05] <tbrowder> it shouldn't be, but not good practice for public docs

[12:12] <tbrowder> i meant to say it's not necessary to end on the last line.

[12:15] <tbrowder> i first read your question as whether you need an "=end pod" line. the answer is no since the end of file acts as the end of pod after a "=begin  pod"

[12:17] <tbrowder> in fact, a "=finish" line is a very rakuish way to stop file processing immediately--and very handy during development

[12:17] <tbrowder> when porting perl code to raku

[13:44] <lizmat> Altreus: conceivably would could create a special method name that could do that

[13:45] <lizmat> Altreus: re =finish, yes except that the <DATA> handle is not set  :-)

[13:46] <Altreus> Is the slack a sort of magical transparent object so the actual property of my object never gets changed, but simply populated?

[13:47] *** Xliff left
[13:54] <Altreus> I'm guessing split no longer has the knowledge it did in P5, as to how many items it was being split into?

[13:55] <Altreus> based on the assignment

[14:06] *** hankache joined
[14:07] <lizmat> Altreus: there is no context in Raku

[14:08] <lizmat> the only thing you can anticipate on, is the sinking of an object (when it is used in "void" context)

[14:08] <lizmat> m: class A { method sink() { say "sunk" } }; my $a = A.new;    # nothing happens

[14:08] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar b6851c3e7: OUTPUT: «»

[14:09] <lizmat> m: class A { method sink() { say "sunk" } }; A.new;    # the object is sunk, by having its 'sink' method called

[14:09] *** hankache_ left
[14:09] <Altreus> I like perl5's contexts but I also like raku's not contexts

[14:10] <lizmat> Altreus: wrt to slack, yeah, that's pretty magical

[14:10] <lizmat> basically, *all* method calls on that object will *always* be a specific piece of code

[14:10] <lizmat> *handled by

[14:11] <Altreus> I was suddenly confused because I was talking about emoji and someone showed me slack's list in JSON format

[14:11] *** Doc_Holliwould left
[14:12] <Altreus> but, hmm

[14:12] <Altreus> Could there be a metamethod that resets it?

[14:12] <Altreus> is that a naughty use of meta?

[14:14] <lizmat> you could argue that: this is where each method call is handled: https://github.com/lizmat/Object-Trampoline/blob/master/lib/Object/Trampoline.pm6#L12

[14:15] <lizmat> that magic is only possible with https://github.com/lizmat/Object-Trampoline/blob/master/lib/Object/Trampoline.pm6#L3

[14:16] <lizmat> which consists of: https://github.com/lizmat/InterceptAllMethods/blob/master/lib/InterceptAllMethods.pm6

[16:11] <tobs> I did a bit of research on Rational.base-repeating. The docs mention that it will stop looking for repeating digits after 1_000. Old design docs say 100_000 and since March 2015 Rakudo actually doesn't enforce any limit anymore.

[16:12] <tobs> I think the reason for that limit in the old specs was that you can conceivably use base-repeats to make Rakudo generate around $n bytes of data when fed a number close to $n, so only log($n) bits. A DoS kind of scenario.

[16:13] <tobs> Does anyone have a feeling if this is a documentation or a Rakudo bug?

[16:14] <tobs> Maybe there should not be a limit and the docs should state that but warn the user to sanitize their inputs?

[16:15] <Altreus> I wish I understood that because it looks interesting

[16:25] <tobs> Can't hurt to file it for Rakudo, I think...

[16:27] <cfa> tobs: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/418c1f33a1

[16:28] <cfa> the only limit i can see is in the old, replaced algorithm

[16:28] *** Doc_Holliwould joined
[16:28] <cfa> which is what i think you're referring to

[18:11] <Altreus> cos desktop-dir and documents-dir are not videos-dir?

[18:11] <rypervenche> Oh, bad output. I changed the variable I was using.

[18:12] <Altreus> damn, I thought I was clever

[18:12] <rypervenche> Haha. I have more variables in the hash, but that's essentially what it looks like. raku-debug said Circular module loading detected trying to precompile /home/rypervenche/.raku/sources/3E687CA5BFB386524F923BAC2F986CC3C66BD24F so I'm wondering if I did all of the "use" things incorrectly.

[18:14] <Altreus> nothing here suggests circular, but it doesn't show User::Dirs::Grammar or User::Dirs::Actions so who knows!

[18:19] <rypervenche> Altreus: My User::Dirs::Grammar and User::Dirs::Actions are in the two gists just above.

[18:19] <Altreus> oops, missed that

[18:19] <Altreus> doesn't look circular, no

[18:19] <Altreus> it's usually pretty clear where

[18:20] <Altreus> Also I'm surprised it isn't reporting the real name of the source it's complaining about

[18:20] <rypervenche> Could it be anything with my not zef installing the module? I'm just running it from the directory.

[18:21] *** wamba joined
[18:21] <Altreus> not usually an issue

[18:23] <Altreus> This might be a more subtle thing than I'm able to help with

[18:23] <rypervenche> Thanks for taking a look.

[18:23] <Altreus> It might be a compile time vs runtime thing

[18:23] <Altreus> hey what if you put all of that inside sub EXPORT?

[18:24] <rypervenche> I tried manually putting a hash inside of the EXPORT sub and same thing. Said it is not declared.

[18:24] <Altreus> good test! No idea though

[18:24] <rypervenche> I've been following this: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#EXPORT

[18:24] <Altreus> yeah :z

[19:05] <guifa> rypervenche: can you dd the %vars hash?

[19:37] <guifa> Hmm.  Okay, try just   sub EXPORT { %( ‘$foo’ => ‘bar’ ) } and see if you can access $foo.

[19:40] <rypervenche> Variable '$foo' is not declared

[19:42] <guifa> Hmm, now that’s just odd

[19:44] <lizmat> in what scope is sub EXPORT ? 

[19:44] <lizmat> it should be in the outer scope, and not within the class

[19:45] <rypervenche> It's in the module's main file: https://gitlab.com/rypervenche/user-dirs/-/blob/master/lib/User/Dirs.rakumod

[19:46] <cfa> hmm, is there a (potentially ecosystem) variant of 'is default' that will take a block?
