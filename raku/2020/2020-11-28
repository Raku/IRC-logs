[17:28] <tbrowder> ah, ok, but you might mention that and be consistent with your comment style, ;; vs #

[17:45] <samebchase-> tbrowder: In the Clojure snippets I'm commenting using ";;" and in the Raku snippets I'm commenting with "#" unless I messed up somewhere, let me check

[17:48] <tbrowder> ok, i'll be quiet, you are probably right. love the article

[17:49] <tbrowder> i never looked into clojure before and didn't realize its lisp roots

[17:53] <tbrowder> i've always wanted to dabble with scheme for emacs purposes but never understood why so many variants of the same language

[17:53] <tbrowder> um, gnucash uses scheme...

[17:55] <tbrowder> sorry, emacs lisp is the variant

[17:55] <tbrowder> erg

[17:58] <MasterDuke> i've always been attracted to the theoretical purity/simplicity of scheme. but then the only two that i've actually had any interest in and used are racket and clojure, both very much batteries-included, raku-like-in-their-size languages

[17:59] <MasterDuke> guifa2: yeah, the non-64bit types have some problems

[17:59] <guifa2> MasterDuke: ah noted.  I posted an issue on Rakudo, but couldn't quite tell if it's Rakudo or MoarVM

[17:59] <guifa2> I only have ... *counts* 40 class files to change haha

[18:12] <guifa2> MasterDuke: well dang, switching everything to natives didn't get me any speed up =\ I wonder if there's still an unboxing somewhere that I'm missing

Not sure how I can make that any faster sadly =\ (I bind all of the attributes to equivalently named keys, in addition to keys that match the camelCase that CLDR uses.  Commenting out the worst of them (with ~¬†200 binds) plummeted the runtime

[20:42] *** xinming_ left
[20:43] <guifa2> I guess I can just remove that feature and and have the hashy access just do $."$key"(), and maybe caching it?
