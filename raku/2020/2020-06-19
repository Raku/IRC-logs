[06:32] *** molaf left
[06:33] <moritz> that said, I don't know how to map char to a raku type, maybe just map it as an uint8 and pass in .ord of the character?

[19:03] <Xliff> jnthn: Any thoughts on my latest discovery on #3756

[19:08] * [Coke] wonders why that didn't link

[19:08] <[Coke]> R#3756

[19:08] <Xliff> #3756

[19:08] <linkable6> R#3756 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3756 cglobal does not seen to return the proper values for a global symbol

[19:09] <[Coke]> took me a second to realize that was C and not Raku code. :)

[19:09] <Xliff> :)

[19:40] <Manifest0> i have a promise inside a react block and then when i do "$promise.then: -> $v {done}". The code hangs, no error. Is it normal?

[19:40] *** elcaro left
[19:40] <Manifest0> Example: https://paste.opensuse.org/42328239. The last "say" never runs

[19:57] *** elcaro joined
[19:59] <sena_kun> Manifest0, react is blocking.

[20:00] <Manifest0> i'm not understanding. Is blocking what?

[20:01] <sena_kun> Give me a moment or two.

[20:05] <timotimo> haven't looked at the code, but you probably want whenever $promise { done } rather than using .then

[20:05] <sena_kun> Manifest0, are you sure the socket receives the line you send in the first place?

[20:07] <Manifest0> sena_kun: yes

[20:09] <Manifest0> timotimo: i want to execute the code when the promise is kept.

[20:10] <sena_kun> Whenever on promise runs when it is kept and you can avoid `then`.

[20:11] *** Demos[m] left
[20:15] <Manifest0> nice :-)

[20:15] <Manifest0> Just checked the documentation, and there's only a note in the methods "in" and "at" on the promise class

[20:17] <Manifest0> Also there's no mention about it in the Concurrency page (promise section). 

[20:18] <timotimo> whenever

[20:18] <timotimo> The whenever keyword can be used in supply blocks or in react blocks. From the 6.d version, it needs to be used within the lexical scope of them. It introduces a block of code that will be run when prompted by an asynchronous event that it specifies - that could be a Supply, a Channel, a Promise or an Iterable.

[20:20] <timotimo> so we should add a forward reference from Promise to whenever perhaps?

[20:22] <[Coke]> +1

[20:24] <Manifest0> Now it works :-)

[20:25] <Manifest0> Super XD

[20:27] <vrurg> One more Raku talk from me is accepted for TPRCiC: https://tpc20cic.sched.com/event/cmGw/lock-less-concurrent-programming-in-raku

[20:35] <MasterDuke> https://lwn.net/Articles/818129/ and https://lwn.net/Articles/816922/ have some interesting information about python proposals. their ideas about how to do something like `:$foo` and a new PEG parser proposed for CPython respectively
