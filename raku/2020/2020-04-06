[00:02] <ToddAndMargo> I sometimes show her my accomplishments.  She gives me love eyes.  I can tell programming goes over her head

[00:04] <tbrowder> i keep meaning to try raku on win but too busy

[00:04] <ToddAndMargo> I have till July when g-suite discontinues less secure apps to get smtp and OAuth2 working

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo> this is odd.  I tried `zef install OAuth2::Client::Google` in my widows 10 virtual machine (VM) and it installed perfectly.  Tried i my w7 vm and get the same error message again.  I will reinstall git and see what happens

[00:10] *** rbtca left
[00:11] <ToddAndMargo> force install did not work either.  Odd, if something is not going to work, it is typically w10 not w7

[00:29] <tbrowder> i do want to install on win for educational (and marketing) purposes but i'm not aware of win intstallation issues or testing or anything about.

[00:29] <tbrowder> how to port modules to win or mac

[00:32] <ToddAndMargo> I just zef what I want.   I just opened git path psunzip failure in Windows 7, but not 10.   https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/341

[09:32] <AlexDaniel> Kuro3: will you submit a bug report?

[09:33] <Kuro3> The last modified time on the file I found that in, was Oct 2016

[09:33] <Kuro3> and it was working back then

[10:10] *** rbtca left
[10:10] <AlexDaniel> Kuro3: generally, I'm not sure what the meaning of a constant channel is

[10:11] *** rbtca joined
[10:11] <Kuro3> honestly, I can't really remember

[10:11] <AlexDaniel> Kuro3: so maybe you shouldn't be doing that in the first place, but the current failure mode is bad anyways

[10:12] <Kuro3> I haven't had the time to do any programming for the past couple years

[10:12] <Kuro3> but with what's going on in the world right now, I've found a bunch of free time

[10:12] <AlexDaniel> that's good, I guess! :)

[10:12] <Kuro3> didn't even know about the renaming until yesterday!

[10:13] <Kuro3> things have come a long way over the past few years as far as optimizations and new community modules :D

[10:14] <AlexDaniel> Kuro3: very often `constant` works as a footgun, in fact it's the first documented trap: https://docs.raku.org/language/traps#Constants_are_computed_at_compile_time

[10:15] <AlexDaniel> a constant channel should probably work, I guess, but it's still weird

[10:16] *** markoong left
[10:16] *** markong joined
[10:17] <Kuro3> I think, though may be mistaken, that it was used here as a way to have a single channel shared between all instances of this class

[10:18] <AlexDaniel> m: class Foo { my $c = Channel.new; method c() { $c } }; say Foo.new.c.WHERE; say Foo.new.c.WHERE

[10:19] <AlexDaniel> Kuro3: ‚Üë it doesn't have to be a constant :)

[10:20] <Kuro3> ahh, using my instead of has

[10:27] <Kuro3> aha, I think I just found the piece of example code where I got the idea of using constant Channel from

[10:27] <Kuro3> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/perl6-IRC-Client/blob/master/examples/04-bash-bot.p6

[10:28] <Kuro3> not sure why he was using constant there, but I was using a Channel in a similar way so I just followed his example

[13:40] <Altreus> I think I have a race condition centred around this https://github.com/shuppet/p6-api-discord/blob/bug/35-reconnect-issue/lib/API/Discord/Connection.pm6#L239

[13:40] <Altreus> It doesn't seem to actually complete

[13:40] <Altreus> But it occurs to me that it could take a non-negligible amount of time to complete even if I could figure out why

[13:40] <Altreus> So I also have an issue where my websocket never actually closes

[13:41] <Altreus> The race condition comes in here: https://github.com/shuppet/p6-api-discord/blob/bug/35-reconnect-issue/lib/API/Discord/Connection.pm6#L169

[19:05] <chloekek> Why does DBIish SQLite append .sqlite3 to the database name?

[19:06] <chloekek> I know the workaround, but not the reasoning.

[19:10] <chloekek> Because IME, every time a library is wrapped, and the wrapper gives ‚Äúit‚Äôs own twist‚Äù to the API, that is going to cause confusion.

[19:12] <lizmat> And another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/04/06/2020-14-more-perspectives/

[19:14] <MasterDuke> lizmat: looks like you missed guifa's binary grammar musing?

[19:15] <lizmat> MasterDuke: looks like it?  is it posted somewhere?

[19:15] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/alabamenhu/2fec7a8f51a24091dc1b104a2ae2f04d

[19:15] <lizmat> I'm not omniscient   :-(

[19:16] <MasterDuke> it was also posted to the FB group

[19:16] <MasterDuke> lizmat: pretty hard to fault you for that...

[19:16] <lizmat> I don't do FB  :-(

[19:17] <lizmat> weekly: grammar proposal by guifa https://gist.github.com/alabamenhu/2fec7a8f51a24091dc1b104a2ae2f04d

[19:17] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[19:18] <chloekek> So I just discovered CRAI hadn‚Äôt been downloading new versions of packages due to a bug. The bug: the line that called the function that did all the downloading was accidentally removed from MAIN half a year ago.

[19:19] <guifa> lizmat: I posted it in here it was late at night for your side of the Atlantic

[19:19] <guifa> (that‚Äôs also what the custom declarator question on SO is about, btw)

[19:20] <lizmat> please either Tweet about it with #rakulang, or do a weekly: here

[19:20] <lizmat> that would make it easier for me  :-)

[19:20] <guifa> lizmat++ I didn‚Äôt want to spam the weekly.  It was a quick proposal but I‚Äôve been slowly fleshing it out more so maybe it‚Äôs worth the extra eyes

[19:21] <lizmat> can you tweet about it?  then I can retweet... or I can tweet on your behalf

[19:21] <lizmat> guifa: it wouldn't be spam, it would be welcome content!

[19:22] <guifa> I don‚Äôt have twitter :-(  but feel free to tweet on my behalf.  I actually just made the gist public a few hours ago 

[19:22] <lizmat> okido

[19:22] <lizmat> should I use guifa or alabamenhu or another name for you ?

[19:22] <guifa> haha

[19:22] <guifa> um‚Ä¶ I really do go by too many names at this point, don‚Äôt I?

[19:23] <lizmat> well... I don't have an opinion on that... just what you would like me to call you in the tweet  :-)

[19:23] <guifa> Probably guifa, it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve used more often.  But someone grabbed it on github before I made an account booooo

[19:24] <lizmat> I see... okido

[20:13] <guifa> synthmeat: I have zero experience there.  Is there much much split-byte work needed or does most stuff align with bytes? 

[20:14] <sena_kun> guifa, in binary protocols bit flags are rather common, if you ask me.

[20:15] <guifa> sena_kun: that I imagined, but are things ever split across bytes?

[20:15] <guifa> e.g.

[20:15] <guifa> 3 bit mask, 8 bit mask, 5 bit mask in that order?  Or would they go more like 3 bit 5 bit 8 bit so that the 3 and 5 would be aligned to a byte?

[20:15] <sena_kun> you mean something starts in a byte and ends in another? this one is uncommon

[20:15] <sena_kun> or, I am not aware of it

[20:16] <guifa> sena_kun++ that‚Äôs the only thing I was really wondering about when writing the proposal

[20:16] <synthmeat> yeah, i don't recall something like that either

[20:17] <sena_kun> well, I am not really an expert, just kinda implemented ASN.1 BER once and it used bit flags a lot, but usually minimal processing unit is a byte.

[20:19] <sena_kun> while single "units" which carry data can contain arbitrary length (in bytes) of data

[20:19] <sena_kun> I'd say if you can implement TLV decoding you're pretty safe.

[20:19] <guifa> If things are kept within a byte / word, then the & conjunction could handle things fairly nicely, or maybe that could be a condition of allowing a sub-byte capture (but the question with a subbyte capture would be if you should right align, e.g, (101)(00001), do you read 101 as 10100000 or 00000101? 

[20:20] <guifa> sena_kun: then I think what I have as is (and even allowing capture only on byte/word levels) should be okay 

[20:20] <guifa> I figure anything subbyte level could be done later, as I can catch it as a syntax error at the moment

[20:20] * sena_kun is ashamed of not reading the proposal itself yet

[20:21] <sena_kun> But I can say I certainly saw a proposal like this one much earlier.

[20:21] <guifa> sena_kun: it‚Äôs long and rambly, no worries :-)

[21:42] <melezhik> I doubt it's unpack problem

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: I don't get it. It says ‚ÄúNo such file or directory‚Äù but the file is there?

[21:43] <melezhik> yes - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/4414c90d8eae6de24b2b993165fb295e#file-gistfile1-txt-L13

[21:44] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: my only guess is that your process is running with its own private /tmp

[21:44] <melezhik> it does say that for other binary files

[21:44] <AlexDaniel> otherwise how can you both have a file and not at the same time?

[21:45] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/4414c90d8eae6de24b2b993165fb295e#gistcomment-3243079

[21:45] <melezhik> I don't know

[21:46] <melezhik> what do you mean by "at the same time"?

[21:46] <melezhik> " No such file or directory" does not necessarily mean that THIS file does exist 

[21:47] <melezhik> it could ambiguously complains  this way that there is some other file is absent  

[21:47] <melezhik> but it's just my guess

[21:48] *** Altai-man_ joined
[21:49] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: the error message is complaining exactly about that file

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> which exists

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> could it be a permission issue?
