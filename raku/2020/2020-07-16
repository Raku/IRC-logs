[06:07] <raku-bridge> <pilne> it's funny, I often wander away from my perl roots and raku infatuation, but I always seem to come back when I realize just how enjoyable DWIM is. sure some of the things I look at handle specific things better, but nothing has ever come close to being as simple, easy, and fun for general purpose stuff as perl/raku.

[15:55] <codesections> How do I `use` a module defined in the same file?  I would've thought I could write a CLI like this: 

[15:55] <codesections>  le Foo { sub foo() is export { say "FOO" } }

[15:55] <codesections>     use Foo;

[15:55] <codesections>     sub MAIN() { foo }

[15:56] <JJMerelo> codesections you don't need to use, it's already in the namespace

[16:51] <[Coke]> not that I see

[16:51] * guifa2 is away from home so no Windows machine to boot onto to test

[16:51] <[Coke]> there's /g (get) /s (set) and /l (list) - don't see any other options

[16:52] * guifa2 sighs

[16:52] <guifa2> Why does Windows always have to do things so differently lol

[16:54] <guifa2> oh

[16:54] <guifa2> sweet

[16:54] <guifa2> CLDR actually already recognized this and through their hands up and have a literal entire separate file for Windows timezones mapping them to the standard ones lololol

[22:44] <rypervenche> usermac: I don't use a Mac, but can you try alt+shift+8 (and again with 9)?

[22:45] <usermac> Thank you but no-go on mac

[22:45] <rypervenche> Oh, but that's the double quote version. Hmm. Doesn't seem possible without using some sort of layout that allows you to do it.

[22:46] <oddp_> usermac: They're special quotation. But you don't have to use them, "foo" and 'bar' is just as fine.

[22:46] <oddp_> What are you trying to do?

[22:46] <usermac> So they're not part of Raku? I am learning and the examples show it all the time in code

[22:47] *** xinming_ left
[22:47] <usermac> # OUTPUT: ÔΩ¢I ‚ô• RakuÔΩ£ love => ÔΩ¢‚ô•ÔΩ£ lang => ÔΩ¢RakuÔΩ£

[22:47] <usermac> above is an example from roku.org home screen

[22:49] *** xinming_ joined
[22:49] <jnthn> No idea how to type them on Mac, but yes, they are a Raku quoting constructing, and used in the regex match output. They were chosen because they're very unlikely to be encountered otherwise, and so allow the output to be displayed without escaping.

[22:49] <usermac> Ah, thank you.
