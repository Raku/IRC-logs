[09:23] <sarna> hey, a question - why does that trait have the name it has? https://docs.raku.org/type/Attribute#index-entry-trait_is_built_(Attribute)-trait_is_built

[09:23] <tellable6> 2020-01-31T23:12:53Z #raku <uzl[m]> sarna Still trying to figure out how to make the grid layout work for smaller screen size. Pretty much a CSS noob ;-).

[09:24] <sarna> I'm struggling to find a connection between the name and what it does

[09:27] <lizmat> has $!foo  is a private attribute, that you cannot set with .new and which does not have an accessor

[09:28] <lizmat> has $!foo is built  is a private attribute, that you *can* set with .new, but which does not have an accessor

[09:28] *** konvertex joined
[09:28] <lizmat> has $.foo is built(False) is a public attribute with an accessor, but which you can *not* set with .new

[09:28] <lizmat> sarna ^^

[09:30] <sarna> lizmat: yeah that's understandable, I just don't get why it's called "is built" :D  like.. built-in? already-built-so-you-can't-modify-it?

[09:30] <lizmat> well, specifying it with .new is building the object wit it

[09:30] <lizmat> *with

[09:30] <lizmat> there's also a method BUILD

[09:31] <lizmat> "is build" would be grammatically incorrect

[09:31] <lizmat> hence "is built"

[09:32] <sarna> oh, so you can only change it during the building, and when it's built it stays?

[11:47] <hankache> The RC for Rakudo Star 2020.05.1 on Windows is available at https://hankache.com/files would you be kind enough to test it and report possible issues? I was having trouble setting permissions and one specific file "repo.lock" kept me from installing modules. I figure out a way to adjust permission for said file at install time.

[15:03] <Dwarf> Hm. Running my code on ARM is surprisingly slow. I wonder where the slowness comes from and where I can gain some speed

[15:04] <Altai-man_> Dwarf, afaik there are no JIT support on ARM, so unless you can help with implementing one...

[15:04] <tellable6> 2020-05-15T16:28:14Z #raku <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2020-05-15#l317

[15:04] <MasterDuke> Dwarf: the JIT isn't supported on ARM. but nowadays spesh provides a lot of speedup and this is supported, so i'm kind of surprised. maybe compare a profile of the same code running on x86? and/or what does perf show?

[15:06] <Dwarf> Ah it's true that Ubuntu ships a rather "old" rakudo

[15:06] <Dwarf> This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11

[15:07] <Dwarf> I should probably get a newer version from the website and see if it helps speed things up a bit

[15:07] <MasterDuke> El_Che has recent packages for many distros 

[15:07] <Dwarf> Should I ask him nicely or are these available publically somewhere?

[15:08] <Altai-man_> Dwarf, https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/ <-

[15:09] <Dwarf> You're a saint. Thank you

[15:09] <El_Che> MasterDuke: the latest!

[15:09] <El_Che> :)

[15:10] <Dwarf> I'm on 64bit ARM so I might just have JIT

[15:10] <Dwarf> fingers crossed

[15:10] <Dwarf> N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-arm64/Packages' as repository 'https://dl.bintray.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg-debs focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'arm64'

[15:11] <Dwarf> That's a no.

[15:11] <Dwarf> Ah that's a shame. I can attempt to compile it myself I guess

[15:13] <MasterDuke> the jit uses libffi and/or dyncall and i think those aren't ported to arm, but timotimo would be a good person to ask

[15:15] <Altai-man_> dyncall works on arm and arm64, https://www.dyncall.org/

[16:16] <jjmerelo> Can we do something about IO::Capture::Simple? 

[16:16] <jjmerelo> It's failing to install, created a PR 20 days ago, no answer.

[16:16] <tbrowder> i am investigating implementing some NYI parts of sprintf and i keep seeing slight errors in our docs when comparing perl's description (where most of our doc comes from) with what i see at <http://www.cplusplus.com>. according to roast sprintf is meant to be identical to the C library, so before i go too far, i would like us to condsider a major rewrite of our sprintf doc (to be self-assigned if no objection). one thing 

[16:16] <tbrowder> the c++ reference offers that is really helpful is a table with notes that imho is better than our docs or perl's docs at detailing the nuances and dependencies among various combinations of flags, modifiers, size, and directives. opinion kindly solicited.

[16:17] <jjmerelo> tbrowder by all means. Go ahead.

[16:18] <tbrowder> the fsf (gnu) also has a good reference.

[16:19] <jjmerelo> So, again, any objection if I adopt IO::Capture::Simple for myself or the community?

[16:20] *** chenyf left
[16:20] <jjmerelo> There are many classes that depend on it... 

[16:20] *** aborazmeh left
[16:22] <tbrowder> in the process, we need the experts to weigh in on how some of the NYI parts should actually be implemented, so i will try to write up a little doc for how i intend to proceed and make sure i'm heading down the right path.

[17:58] <Xliff> .tell tigerpaws For opaque structs, it's best to use a repr<CPointer> for that class. It doesn't need any members. The only drawback to that is if you ever need to create an array of such structs. In that case, you will need some mechanism to return the C size of that struct in Raku.

[17:58] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to tigerpaws

[17:59] <Xliff> .tell tigerpaws In that case, you will need to cheat. Either grab the size from C, or grab the struct definition from the .c file

[17:59] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to tigerpaws

[18:00] <tigerpaws> Hi, Xliff. That is exactly what I was thinking of doing, I was also considering possibly putting in a dummy private attribute. I lloked at the code, and I think they rally are just opaque structs, since I only see them being passed around

[18:01] <Xliff> tigerpaws: Yes, then "class TF_struct is repr<CPointer> is export { * }" should be sufficient enough.

[18:02] <tigerpaws> Xliff: Once I get to impelement the methods on these classes, I'll see if any thing further is warranted. 

[18:02] <Xliff> tigerpaws: And if you want, you can attach all subs that use TF_struct as a first parameter as methods to that class.

[18:02] <Xliff> tigerpaws: Sounds good.

[18:02] <tigerpaws> Xliff: exactly what I was planning. 

[18:03] <Xliff> tigerpaws: So I don't know if this is really well documented, but "class TF_struct is repr<CPointer> { method a_tf_struct_method (param1, param2, param3) is native(lib) { * }; } should be sufficient enough for that purposes.

[18:04] <Xliff> tigerpaws: So param1 is the parameter AFTER the TF_struct in the C signature

[18:04] <tigerpaws> Xliff: what puzzles me is that GPTrixie generates the empty struct and then a constant: constant TF_Session is export := TF_Session , which gets a duplicate definition error. I'm considering just dumping the constants. 

[18:04] *** jjmerelo left
[18:05] <Xliff> Yeah, I think GPTrixie is lagged behind recent changes in Rakudo.

[18:05] <Xliff> That and I don't think the GPTrixie output is designed to be directly usable by Rakudo withouth hand tuning.

[18:06] <tigerpaws> I'm beginning to see that. It's a good start, but it's too bad because when they change the api, I'm going to have to hand carry all the changes over. 

[18:07] <tigerpaws> What bugs me the most, is that the c api doesn't yet support Tensoflow 2.x, and from their page, there are a lot of changes. 

[18:10] <Xliff> Yes, that is a problem. I have the same issue with GTK. That's why I've written code-generators to mitigate the drudgery.

[18:10] <Xliff> If you want, I can see about doing the same for Tensorflow. 

[18:11] <Xliff> With regards to the 2.x stuff, NativeCall *can* handle C++, I just haven't had much of a chance to do anything with it. Particularly when it comes to compiler name mangling and polymorphism.

[18:40] <tigerpaws> Well, I think  that the current C api will give us the basics, certainly enough to contruct and run graphs, and it's probably easy to add gradients direclty in raku. The neural network library we'll have to see. 

[18:42] <tigerpaws> Xliff: I received an answer from the J language people, end there's no problem inlining J into raku. I don't know how familiar you are with array langauges, but J would give us a fairly solid array langauge. 

[18:42] <tellable6> tigerpaws, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[18:42] <lizmat> tigerpaws: it would be a good start
