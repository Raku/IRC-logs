[20:45] <melezhik> what is the simplest way to implement array of array in Raku, basically I need to generate a matrix of ints, where both columns and rows are sorted from left to the right and top to the bottom 

[20:45] <tellable6> 2020-10-30T08:24:55Z #raku <jmerelo> melezhik not totally sure what you're talking about...

[20:45] <tellable6> 2020-11-01T10:25:31Z #raku-dev <jmerelo> melezhik Hacktoberfest is over... We still need the testing, too.

[21:54] <Xliff> How can I stop "Malformed UTF8" errors globally?

[21:55] <Xliff> I know I should use utf8-c8, but I am getting these errors without using encode/decode

[21:55] <Grinnz> in a completely uneducated guess, your input might not be valid UTF-8 bytes?

[21:56] <Xliff> Yep. I realize.

[21:56] <Grinnz> what is it then?

[21:56] <Xliff> Getting string data from a C-Struct is throwing the error.

[21:56] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:57] <Xliff> Can't debug further unless I mute that and look at what's coming back.

[21:57] <Xliff> I may need to use another method, then.
