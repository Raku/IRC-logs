[00:24] <RaycatWhoDat> Hello.

[00:26] <RaycatWhoDat> Just have one question about Raku today: do you feel like Raku is a good language for solving problems with changing requirements?

[00:27] <lucs> Changing requirements is more of a management problem, no?

[00:28] <[Coke]> Yes, although I feel like your process has more to do with that than your language.

[00:28] <[Coke]> "be agile" "move things left" yada yada.

[00:29] <RaycatWhoDat> That is a fair point.

[00:30] <guifa> I find Raku to be fairly nice for doing regular refactors

[00:30] <guifa> Which could probably be evidence of going well with changing requirements, thoguh not exactly the same thing

[00:31] <RaycatWhoDat> What's that process like? Is there any hot-patching functionality similar to say, Lisp?

[00:31] *** xinming_ left
[00:31] <RaycatWhoDat> Or is it just good ol' refactoring?

[00:32] *** xinming_ joined
[00:32] <[Coke]> comma IDE has actual refactoring support, I think.

[00:33] * guifa isn't familiar with Lisp, unfortunately, so can't comment along those lines

[00:34] <RaycatWhoDat> Ah. Basically, you keep a core image running, connect remotely into the image, and recompile a function inside.

[00:34] <RaycatWhoDat> Also, I didn't know there was a whole IDE to Raku,.

[00:34] <guifa> I don't believe you can do that right now, but there's really no reason such a thing couldn't be done down the road I don't think

[00:35] <hobbs> RaycatWhoDat: that kind of thing is entirely possible technically, but I don't know of any developer environment for it short of writing all the bits yourself :)

[00:36] <RaycatWhoDat> Gotcha. I would make it but I am not good enough to do so.

[00:36] <hobbs> but the language lets you compile code at runtime, functions and blocks are first-class, and there's enough introspection into the lexical environment and things like that, that I don't see why not :)

[00:39] <RaycatWhoDat> Mm. I think I'll have to explore Raku again. I keep jumping back-and-forth because I have terrible FOMO but it's always fascinated me.

[00:39] <RaycatWhoDat> I want a language that's fun to explore and write in, not just another popular one and not one that just gets hated on forever.

[00:40] <hobbs> well I'm not sure if you can really dodge all the hate in the world, but there's definitely some fun to be had

[00:42] <RaycatWhoDat> Yeah, I know it's a lost cause.

[00:42] <RaycatWhoDat> I'm a JavaScript dev so, my whole career is shit to other devs.

[00:43] <RaycatWhoDat> I just wanna have fun and make games, to be honest.

[00:48] <hobbs> I do a bit of JS, and there's some nice things that have happened in the language core, but I can't buy into the ever-shifting frameworks and libraries.

[00:48] <hobbs> I used to work for a Perl shop, then they decided to throw everything away and replace it with Node because "Perl devs are too hard to hire". Now I mostly get paid to write Go.

[00:49] <hobbs> which is... okay :)

[00:50] <RaycatWhoDat> See, that's a solid criticism. I don't like the JS ecosystem very much

[00:50] <RaycatWhoDat> Would much rather prefer a solid number of curated libraries

[00:50] <[Coke]> I've worked for several local consulting places, and getting matches between perl devs and perl gig was never easy in this area.

[00:51] <[Coke]> and the gigs were often "oh, hey, we didn't really support this mission critical app, can you... do something?"

[00:51] <hobbs> heh, yeah :)

[00:51] <RaycatWhoDat> Do y'all use Perl and Raku?

[00:51] <RaycatWhoDat> Or just Raku?

[00:52] <hobbs> there's still Perl in my life

[00:53] <hobbs> one of my bigger hobby projects at the moment is a bunch of services talking to each other written in a mix of Perl, Python, and Fortran :)

[00:53] <Grinnz> RaycatWhoDat: look at it this way, you're not a php developer :)

[00:55] <RaycatWhoDat> I don't recall PHP being too painful

[00:55] <RaycatWhoDat> But I only scratched the surface of it

[00:56] <Grinnz> http://phpsadness.com/

[00:56] <Grinnz> that the majority of these are not even addressed in 7.0 is really all that needs to be said

[00:57] <RaycatWhoDat> Ehhhhh

[00:58] <RaycatWhoDat> As a JavaScript dev, I can't bring myself to bash on any particular language

[00:59] <Grinnz> even knowing plenty of perl's dirty secrets I still find php a particular kind of wtf

[01:00] <RaycatWhoDat> I think a lot of the web technologies kinda adopt a unhealthy amount of cruft from jump

[01:01] <RaycatWhoDat> Then again, I've only scratched the surface of things so, I don't really know

[15:07] <lucs> I just built the HTML doc from the https://github.com/Raku/doc

[15:08] <jmerelo> lucs: great!

[15:08] <lucs> My local display is different from https://docs.raku.org/

[15:08] <lucs> Is that normal?

[15:09] <lucs> CSS appears to be completely different

[15:09] <jmerelo> lucs: did you build the assets first?

[15:09] <lucs> Not sure...

[15:09] <lucs> When I do  make for-documentable , I get an error:

[15:09] <lucs> Subroutine main::app redefined at (eval 71) line 1.

[15:09] <jmerelo> lucs did you follow instructions here? https://github.com/Raku/doc/#building-the-html-documentation

[15:10] <timotimo> building the assets is probably annoying, so perhaps put pre-built assets on github in the releases tab using whatever CI we have set up

[15:10] <lucs> jmerelo: I think so, yeah.

[15:10] <jmerelo> lucs: please raise an issue...

[15:11] <lucs> jmerelo: Um, reading it again, I think I might have skipped something :/

[15:11] <lucs> I'll see if I can fix it.

[15:11] <jmerelo> timotimo: Well... maybe. But please raise another issue here.

[15:12] <lucs> Must I do this if I already have node installed?: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

[15:12] <lucs> (Running Slackware)

[15:13] <lucs> Oh, wait.

[15:13] <lucs> I didn't do the  cpanm --installdeps .

[15:13] <lucs> Trying...

[15:19] <jmerelo> lucs: there's a good amount of dependencies, I'm afraid... We should try and avoid them.

[15:20] <lucs> Well, so far so good anyway.

[15:21] <lucs> The installdeps worked well, and I'm now doing the  documentable start ...  again.

[15:26] <lucs> Hmm... It appears to have rebuilt the cache, but I seem to still not be getting the proper CSS.

[15:26] <lucs> I'll try a "make clean" (if that exists)

[15:27] <lucs> Okay, doing the 'documentable start ...' now.

[15:40] <lucs> poohman: https://docs.raku.org/programs/03-environment-variables#index-entry-PERL6LIB

[15:41] <jdv79> .Rat seems to work but is that a bug for .Num?

[15:42] <lucs> I guess it's RAKUDOLIB nowadays :)

[15:43] <jdv79> isn't it RAKULIB?

[15:43] <lucs> I see RAKUDOLIB on that web page.

[15:43] <lucs> (hmm... RAKULIB seems more logical, yeah)

[15:43] <jnthn> jdv79: The literal is a Rat, so it has to convert it. Not all values that a Rat can represent are representable precisely as a Num, so maybe that's what you're seeing.

[15:52] <jdv79> wow, the number conversions are not terribly intuitive.

[15:53] <jdv79> nope, 25.897532000e0.Num.say does the same thing

[15:54] <jdv79> well. the .Num is useless but still odd result

[15:54] <lucs> I use that last form to build LaTeX scripts, without having to escape half the characters.

[15:55] <lucs> (nothing to do with arrays, but just saying)

[16:53] *** kensanata left
[17:03] *** aindilis left
[17:05] <jnthn> hungrydonkey: What's confusing? If you try to resume an exception that isn't resumable at all (e.g. 'cus it's thrown by the runtime), you'll get an exception telling you it's not possible. Even then, an exception is often thrown by code because going further will have bad consequences. You should only really call .resume on exceptions designed to be used that way.

[17:06] <jnthn> For example, warnings are implemented using resumable control exceptions.

[20:30] <moritz> it turns out that on the evalbot server, share/perl6/core/precomp has accumulated 701MB

[20:31] <melezhik> hopefully we will bring RakuDist soon to community infrastructure, that will untie RakuDist from my azure subscription that will cease in 1-2 months

[20:34] <chloekek> Cool, apparently tomorrow is a day off.

[20:40] <moritz> it is, at least in .de :D

[20:41] <chloekek> And Pentecost as well.

[20:42] <chloekek> I wish holidays were distributed evenly across the year rather than across |(feb .. may), dec.

[20:43] <moritz> agreed

[20:43] <moritz> though many of us take off some time in the jul..sep range

[20:44] <chloekek> Cherry-pick important inventions, discoveries, and accomplishments in the past and celebrate those.

[20:45] <El_Che> melezhik: is there community owned infra since the last one died?

[20:59] *** andrzejku joined
[21:00] <melezhik> El_Che maybe I chose not accurate phasing. Anyway we are bringing RakuDist to the same machine where Blin runs. And RakuDist workers will be run as aws instances

[21:01] <melezhik> rba probably could give more details

[21:01] <melezhik> phasing -> phrasing 

[21:05] <melezhik> I just attached a screenshot of RakuDist web UI part - https://twitter.com/melezhik2/status/1263213845134393344/photo/1

[21:05] <melezhik> the same tweet

[22:22] <melezhik> .tell rba I need 2 http ports open to public or (just one if we decide to proxy by nginx ) on VM to allow RakuDist web UI and Sparky to be accessible publicly 

[22:22] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to rba

[22:23] <El_Che> melezhik: thx for the info

[22:23] <melezhik> yeah, you are welcome

[22:33] <Doc_Holliwould> can i get the arity of a code block?

[22:34] <Doc_Holliwould> or, when i have a callable in a variable, how can i find out how many arguments the block expects?

[22:35] <jnthn> .arity is the number of required positional arguments, .count is the number of positional arguments including optionals and is Inf if it's slurpy

[23:17] <uzl[m]> Hello, everyone! I'm trying to create a class using the MOP but having trouble: https://pastebin.run/5f4q5NMSj- The class I want to recreate is at the top of the file commented out. 

[23:19] *** pecastro left
[23:19] <timotimo> uzl[m]: i think the problem comes from having the "my method" outside of a class, so '$!value' doesn't make sense or cannot be found or whatever

[23:20] <timotimo> you can self.^attributes blah blah .set_value(...) and .get_value()

[23:21] <timotimo> and your attribute addition doesn't make it public i think

[23:22] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/ADT/blob/master/lib/ADT.pm6 - feel free to steal

[23:26] <uzl[m]> timotimo:  I'll definitely steal from it 😄�😅�. Thanks!
