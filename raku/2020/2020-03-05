[15:04] <chloekek> I recall somebody was interested in packaging Rakudo and Raku packages for Nix, but I don’t recall their name.

[15:06] <chloekek> Thing is, for doing that I was working on this index of packages called CRAI and I’m not sure if I want to continue running it.

[15:07] <chloekek> Right now it is not all that useful; it indexes all archives from CPAN and p6c every hour and displays metadata about them on a website. This includes the URL and the hash, which are very useful for package managers.

[15:08] <chloekek> Considering I’m not using Raku all that much I’d like to not run that server anymore as I currently pay for hosting it every month and I don’t think anyone is using it, but the software may still have potential.

[15:09] <regreg> chloekek, how much does it costs to run the server? and what about time sunk?

[15:10] <chloekek> Oh lol it’s only 6 EUR apparently.

[15:10] <rba> chloekek: what is this used for exactly?

[15:11] <regreg> i could pay for it if it has any use for the community but i don't know how to manage it

[15:11] <chloekek> rba: There are currently two places where you can find Raku library archives: CPAN and the ecosystem repository. CPAN provides an easy way to download specific versions (archives) of libraries, but the ecosystem does not as it just points to Git repositories’ master branch.

[15:11] <rba> If there is common community usage, I might take it over under the umbrella of raku infra. 

[15:11] <regreg> but it will have to wait until i receive next disability payment (which will about around 12 march)

[15:12] <chloekek> rba: So I wrote a cronjob that periodically downloads all those libraries though stable tarball URLs, and computes their hashes. This information could be useful if exposed in a machine readable format, but I don’t really have the time to work on that.

[15:12] <chloekek> It generates a SQLite database that has a table in it with (tarball URL, tarball hash, META6 extract)

[15:12] <rba> Does it overlap with modules.raku.org or zef?

[15:13] <chloekek> modules.raku.org only seems to index latest version of each library, and does not provide hashes.

[15:13] <chloekek> Without hashes, you don’t really know what you are downloading.

[15:13] <chloekek> The problem is really with ecosystem repository, it just points to Git repositories, but those don’t tell you how to get a specific version of each library.

[15:13] <rba> Got it. I will take over hosting. Who is taking over the development?

[15:14] <chloekek> Say you want Foo::Bar v1.0. You would need to clone its git repository and search the git commits for the one that bumps the version to v1.0 in META6.json, except for the rare case of libraries using Git tags.

[15:15] <chloekek> And even then, the author could release v1.0, then update the repository to include malicious code, and change the tag to refer to the new commit, and people would suddenly be deploying that.

[15:17] <rba> May we look into details later today. 20:00 CET or later, or this sunday?

[15:17] <chloekek> Sure.

[15:18] <chloekek> May open an issue on problem-solving about archiving and version discovery.

[15:18] <chloekek> jmerelo: was also interested in this.

[15:18] <tellable6> chloekek, I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[15:21] <chloekek> Here’s an example of what it indexes: https://crai.foldr.nl/archive?url=https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/archive/7ceee0baf3c47cdb35fcf6bfa3e83d43b0fc3e8c.tar.gz

[21:40] <Jose86> Quick question when using zef to install a module, in this case Cro, it didnt get added to the Path variable. Does zef currently not do this?

[21:41] <rypervenche> Jose86: Not that I've seen. I set my PATH for my zef-installed modules to be usable (for the executables)

[21:41] <Jose86> Thank you rypervenche

[23:17] <san_goku_ssj_10> HELP

[23:18] <san_goku_ssj_10> How could I change the the value of an argument passed to a routine ?

[23:19] <san_goku_ssj_10> The variable is immuable, and i don't know how to override this feature

[23:19] <san_goku_ssj_10> SORRY, I'M A BIG NOOB

[23:23] <san_goku_ssj_10> Altai-man_ Hi

[23:23] <Altai-man_> san_goku_ssj_10, o/

[23:23] <Altai-man_> oh

[23:24] <Altai-man_> san_goku_ssj_10, can you provide some code? a couple of lines showing what do you want to do.

[23:24] <Altai-man_> as for argument passed, you can e.g. set it as `is rw`:

[23:24] <Altai-man_> m: sub foo($a is rw) { $a = 42 }; my $b = 50; say $b; foo($b); say $b;

[23:25] *** sena_kun left
[23:25] <Altai-man_> san_goku_ssj_10, is ^ close to what you want?

[23:25] <lizmat> there's also "is copy"

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> this code does not work 

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> please help me

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> I'm a super noob

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> and new to Raku

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> I don't understand

[23:43] <san_goku_ssj_10> please help !

[23:44] <rypervenche> san_goku_ssj_10: I believe you should make the default value in the signature.

[23:44] *** pecastro left
[23:45] <san_goku_ssj_10> rypervenche could you please post a sample ?

[23:45] *** markoong left
[23:45] <rypervenche> san_goku_ssj_10: https://pastebin.com/raw/9yBNackX

[23:46] <rypervenche> That is one way, if you want the default $message to have a certain value.

[23:48] <san_goku_ssj_10> rypervenche thanks. It's impossible to change the value of the variable inside the routine ?

[23:49] <rypervenche> san_goku_ssj_10: As others have said, you can add "is rw" or "is copy" after Str $message in the signature.

[23:50] <san_goku_ssj_10> I have try it

[23:50] <san_goku_ssj_10> but I have this error message

[23:50] <san_goku_ssj_10> Parameter '$message' expected a writable container, but got Str value  in sub message at main.pl line 3  in block <unit> at main.pl line 10

[23:51] <rypervenche> Ah yes, I'm wrong there.

[23:52] <rypervenche> Try "is copy" instead.

[23:52] <rypervenche> That works.

[23:52] <san_goku_ssj_10> thanks

[23:53] <san_goku_ssj_10> Perl6 is a lot functionnal

[23:53] <san_goku_ssj_10> i think

[23:53] <rypervenche> That's the idea :)
