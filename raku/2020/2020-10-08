[08:23] <Zero_Dogg> I'm trying to learn how grammars work. I've got a parser that takes some user input (via prompt()) and one subcomponent of those is a date. I want to further parse the date into year, mont and day components. I've tried using make, but I'm not sure if it's correct, nor how I'm actually suppose to access it.

[08:23] <Zero_Dogg> Grammar example: https://paste.centos.org/view/25b37101, input could be ie. 08/10/2020

[08:26] <Zero_Dogg> the date token matches fine, I'm just unsure about how to refine it into the year, month, day tokens and then access those

[08:29] <moritz> you could do something like token month { [ 0\d | 1<[0..2]> ] { make $/.Int } }

[08:30] <moritz> but it's easier to just convert it to integer in date, as you do right now

[08:30] <moritz> Zero_Dogg: does that answer your question?

[08:33] <Zero_Dogg> moritz: not quite, because I'm not sure how to access that made value. Given $reply = pasScoreInput.parse("08/10/2020"); I get a string as $reply.<date>, but there's no .<date>.made, and no .made either. I'm probably missing some essential understanding about make/made

[08:37] *** BenGoldberg joined
[08:45] <Zero_Dogg> ah, okay, so, I'm actually making this mess by having an array in TOP

[08:46] <Zero_Dogg> I get it now. Thanks

[09:12] <Zero_Dogg> moritz: thanks!

[09:12] <moritz> calling the parse method with :rule<date> allows you to debug the logic around date more easily

[09:28] <ufobat> can one write libs in raku, compile them into a jar and use it in java/kotlin projects?

[09:28] <Zero_Dogg> moritz: thanks, I'll keep that in mind. This is all very different from the regex monstrosities I used to parse stuff in perl

[12:51] <daxim> do we have a focus/optics/lens library?

[12:56] *** ufobat left
[13:01] *** frost-lab left
[13:01] <lizmat> daxim is there one in Perl ?   then Inline::Perl5 should allow you to use that ?

[13:01] <Altreus> what would such a thing do?

[13:02] <moritz> calculate beam shapes based on lenses?

[13:02] <moritz> dunno if anybody has *focused* on that yet /rimshot

[13:02] <rypervenche> Geez, you're on a roll today.

[13:02] <daxim> Data::Focus, but I don't like the API details, too much emphasis on classes

[13:03] <Altai-man> As for Haskell-ish lens - nothing similar.

[13:04] <Altreus> Did Haskell do lenses or was that Fresnel?

[13:05] <lizmat> and there was me thinking it had anything to do with optical lenses

[13:05] <Altreus> I mean the original question was focus/optics/lens

[13:05] <Altreus> very suggestive language

[13:06] <moritz> if you build your metaphor too well, nobody can tell if you're talking in that metaphor anymore :-)

[13:07] <Altai-man> Altreus, there is a js package named "optics" which imitates Haskell lens, Data::Focus imitates the same, so it's likely the question is about those.

[13:07] <daxim> I want my lambdacamels back :(

[13:08] <Altreus> crikey

[13:08] <Altreus> It would have helped if I had any idea what it meant in this context :D

[13:08] <Altreus> I didn't even realise there was a way to get it wrong

[13:53] <rypervenche> Is there a way to bisect this since it requires a SIGINT? (jnthn provided test code at the bottom) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3547

[13:53] <rypervenche> It looks like it was fixed at some point.

[13:54] <moritz> rypervenche: you could try to write a small raku program that sends SIGINT to itself
