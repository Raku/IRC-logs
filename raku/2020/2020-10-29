[02:38] <xinming> In this case, can we make *@b  **b  +@b  the same behavior as function slurp array?

[03:52] <elcaro> xinming: use binding to get function semantics, ie. my ($a, +@b) := (1, @x);

[03:52] <elcaro> This is also usefule when assiging to arrays, eg. my (@a, @b) := (@x, @y)

[03:53] <elcaro> without binding, @a gets everything

[13:16] <hythm> for example, I have this sub here https://github.com/hythm7/Retry/blob/main/lib/Retry.rakumod#L3 , that I can call with "retry { something() }", how can I make it work also with "retry something()"

[13:17] <moritz> you cannot

[13:17] <moritz> pending macro work

[13:17] <moritz> (maybe you could with a custom language extension, but that doesn't seem worth it)

[13:17] <hythm> hmm,so how does thing like "try" for example work?
