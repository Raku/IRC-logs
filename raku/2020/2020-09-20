[16:07] *** MasterDuke left
[16:09] <stoned75> the documentation for Mu.Str says: "Returns a string representation of the invocant, intended to be machine readable". I'm wondering about the "machine readable part", what does it really mean ?

[16:11] <guifa> stoned75: it just means something intended to potentially be processed by some other entity

[16:11] <guifa> it really contrasts more with gist

[16:11] <guifa> So for an array, .gist will only show the first 50 (or 100?) elements.  .Str will give every single element

[16:13] <stoned75> hum.. ok. I see. it's machine readable as opposed to .gist :-)

[16:14] <stoned75> now... I don't quite get what .Stringy is, wrt .Str

[16:15] <stoned75> I mean why does the ~ operator uses .Stringy and not .Str ?

[16:15] <guifa> Stringy is a role (like Numeric)

[16:15] <guifa> Str is just one type of Stringy thing, but it’s the most common of course

[16:16] <stoned75> I meant the Stringy method.

[16:16] <guifa> .Stringy is just required to return something that does Stringy.  That could be a Str (it is, in most cases), but it could also be something else

[16:16] <guifa> So using numbers as an example

[16:17] <guifa> the + prefix returns Numeric

[16:17] <timotimo> m: say Blob ~~ Stringy

[16:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:17] <timotimo> ^- i think this is what makes ~ work as buf concat

[16:17] *** aluaces left
[16:17] <guifa> so Str.Numeric can return anything that’s Numeric — Real, Num, Rat, etc

[16:17] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/releases/download/untagged-4d7ddf784884848bf4fa/MoarPerf-.glibc2.14-x86_64.AppImage - i would appreciate some testers for this AppImage of a Cro webapp

[16:18] *** MasterDuke joined
[16:18] <timotimo> after starting it, it should output a few lines and start a webserver, feel free to ctrl-c it directly after that

[16:18] <guifa> timotimo: I *think* infix:<~> (Buf, Buf) is special cased

[16:19] <timotimo> sourceable6: Buf.new ~ Buf.new

[16:19] <sourceable6> timotimo, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/8e6f7f0/src/core.c/Buf.pm6#L1097

[16:19] *** stanrifkin joined
[16:21] <guifa> The other Stringy is Uni

[16:21] <guifa> But it’s not used very often.  It works more like Strs in other languages

[16:22] *** wamba left
[16:22] <stoned75> ok so we have the Stringy role, for string like classes. so the Stringy method is  the "go to" coercer to get a Stringy, as using '$whatever.Str' to get a Stringy object would have been counterintuitive

[16:22] <stoned75> is that it ? :)

[16:23] <guifa> More or less yeah. 

[16:23] <guifa> $whatever.Str guarantees you a Str 

[16:23] <guifa> And no other class

[16:23] <guifa> $whatever.Stringy could get you a Str, Uni, or Blob

[16:24] <stoned75> ok. thanks!

[16:25] *** sjaveed joined
[16:25] <guifa> (the reason most of those return roles is it makes it easier for you to write in classes that function *like* Strs but aren’t, and still get support if people just ask for Stringy)

[16:26] <stoned75> sure. got it!

[16:40] <rjbs> Hello!  I'm not really here to read replies, although I will see them in due course.

[16:41] <rjbs> Recently, TPF has chartered an infrastructure group that will be providing hosting services and system administration for important software infrastructure -- both that used by the TPF and by the Perl and Raku communities.  This could be static site hosting, web services, mailing lists, and so on.

[16:42] <rjbs> It's early days, so I don't have many specifics to offer, but I wanted to get the word out that this was happening, and that anybody who wants to talk about how we might be able to help could be in touch.  You can email [email@hidden.address] or hit me up on TPF Slack or here.  (Email is probably best.)

[17:49] <patrickb> nine: But (I think) the failure is expected in that case.

[19:43] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I didn't pick it.

[19:43] <[Coke]> also, your subject on the email was incorrect, but I'll allow it.

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> I mean, you shouldn't allow it because it was too late xD

[19:44] <[Coke]> also I'm not sure if your send was in reply to something.

[19:44] <[Coke]> did you deliberately vote after what you thought the deadline was just to cause controversy?

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> -_-

[19:44] <[Coke]> Not that it matters to the voting.

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> no

[19:45] <nine> Huh...I've not voted yet. And I think I'm actually not going to.

[19:45] <stoned75> rypervenche: what does the id command return on the "faulty" machines ?

[19:45] <nine> Well if the deadline is already past, I'm definitely not going to :D

[19:46] <nine> I wouldn't be able to decide anyway. All candidates have merits and I can imagine all of them contributing greatly

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> nine: technically it's already past, but I guess the common understanding of “midnight” is different from what it actually is, so it's fine

[19:50] <[Coke]> I never did say voting was closed or open, though, so not sure where AD led in from. :)

[19:51] <[Coke]> but yes, makes sense to let it go until end of day due to common confusion about midnight.

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: just to clarify, it says in bold “Voting is open between midnight on September 6th UTC & midnight on September 20th UTC.”

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> so that's where I got it from :)

[19:52] <[Coke]> I don't have admin rights on most repos, so I cannot check voter privs through the GUI, and I'm not sure the API is giving me what I'm thinking it is.

[19:52] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: yes. I know what it says.

[19:53] <[Coke]> Just feel like you're trying to give me a hard time here, which I'm sure you're not, intentionally.

[19:53] <[Coke]> I agree: it should have said 11:59:59PM on one of the days to avoid confusion. (That's what I used to do for the TPF GC submitals)

[19:53] <AlexDaniel> no, just wanted to let you know in case you missed this detail. You can decide yourself what to do with that info.

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> either way is fine to me

[19:55] *** squashable6 left
[19:56] <[Coke]> so, looking at https://github.com/Raku/nqp/settings/access - who has commit bits?

[19:56] *** squashable6 joined
[19:57] <[Coke]> ah. it's basically AlexDaniel, samcv (admins), and "everyone in Raku".

[19:57] <[Coke]> ok. I can verify this against jdv79's script...

[19:57] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: this should be the list: https://github.com/orgs/Raku/people?type=source

[19:57] <AlexDaniel> aaah, you're actually more correct, yes: https://github.com/orgs/Raku/teams/raku/members

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> although… why are these lists so different…

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: OK, hold on, this is not entirely right

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> one second let me try something…

[19:59] *** squashable6 left
[20:00] <codesections> rypervenche: sorry if this it too obvious a question, but is the USER environmental variable set to your username outside of Raku on the machines where `say $*USER` outputs «Nil»? 

[20:01] *** squashable6 joined
[20:01] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I'll try to explain. So at some point in the past everyone in the org had write access. That was changed at some point because there are (or were) some limitations to this approach (can't have locked repos that only privileged users can write to)

[20:01] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I believe the default privilege was changed from `write` to `read`

[20:02] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: and the Raku team was created. Then I wrote a script which adds all people to the selected team

[20:02] <[Coke]> I only wanted to check who had privs on that team: the list I get back from jdv79's script has 177 people with admin or write access to nqp, so it seems to match up. the details of how they're assigned probably doesn't matter.

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: however, people forget to add people to the Raku team when they intend to give write access

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> so I reran the script now, and the Raku team has 203 members now

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> this is how it is supposed to be, I believe

[20:03] <[Coke]> 203 or 213?

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> there's still a difference (213 vs 203)

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> let me check why these differ real quick…

[20:04] <[Coke]> ok. i'll re-re-run jdv79's script...

[20:04] <[Coke]> still 242 people.

[20:05] <[Coke]> (those extra few may have already been in one of the other repos?)

[20:06] <[Coke]> er, 240. some had trailing commas missing.

[20:06] <[Coke]> (so they showed up twice)

[20:06] *** patrickb joined
[20:07] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: github is showing 213 in some places and 203 in others, something to do with child teams and stuff… weird

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> either way more is probably right-er

[20:14] <patrickb> nine: I've been thinking about your "wrong version" error a bit more. If I interpret it correctly, it means that 'blib/Perl6/Pod.moarvm' (compiled from 'gen/moar/Pod.nqp') was built against a different version of NQPs 'gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp'. If my understanding of linking in Raku is correct, then that's an expected error. When making changes to nqp and *not* doing a `make clean` in rakudo afterwards, the files in 'blib' will still expect 

[20:14] <patrickb> the older nqp files and fail with the error you observed. make simply doesn't know that it needs to rebuild the files in `blib` when there are changes in NQP.

[20:15] <patrickb> nine: As the expert of Rakudos module handing, is the above correct?

[20:16] <patrickb> .ask timotimo Do you have a specific question about relocatability or do you want a general explanation?

[20:16] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[20:16] * patrickb is off to bed now.

[20:16] *** patrickb left
[20:17] *** rindolf left
[20:28] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: if you can find any of these people, I'll let them know their ballot can count after all: https://gist.github.com/coke/07f167179135f6a868b6a0d526d5437e

[20:28] <[Coke]> but with them removed, we're at:

[20:28] <[Coke]> 46 ballots reporting (Average votes per ballot: 4.70)

[20:29] <[Coke]> (discounting their ballots didn't change the top 7, but it did change the order slightly)

[20:29] <nine> patrickb your understanding of where the error message is coming from is correct. However while make itself isn't smart enough to catch this, our build system used to be. That's the whole point of the check-nqp-version.pl script - to trigger a full rebuild if NQP got updated

[20:29] <[Coke]> 3.5 hours left if we go with the charitable deadline of the upcoming midnight.

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: can I invite some of them? For example, alabamenhu wrote an advent post, did some PRs, wrote a module

[20:31] *** aborazmeh left
[20:31] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: it's just that nobody bothered to invite them yet

[20:31] <[Coke]> I am just tallying votes here.

[20:32] *** aborazmeh joined
[20:32] *** aborazmeh left
[20:32] *** aborazmeh joined
[20:32] <[Coke]> if you need signoff on that, please ask someone else.

[20:32] <[Coke]> (if)

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> well, I'm inviting alabamenhu anyway…

[20:33] <[Coke]> If you're considering one, I ask you consider them all on their merits (no clue which orgs they may have submitted things to)

[20:34] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: alabamenhu is the only nickname I recognized immediately, trying to find the others though

[20:35] <[Coke]> OK. I feel like getting the invite meets the spirit of the request, even if they haven't ACK'd it yet

[20:35] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: you invited them to the Raku org?

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: alabamenhu, yes. The invite does not add them immediately to the Raku team but that's just because I want them to have a chance to turn autosubscribe feature off

[20:37] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/Raku/please-turn-off-the-autowatch-feature :)

[20:37] <[Coke]> ok, let them know their ballot is counting.

[20:38] <[Coke]> *I* let them...

[20:39] <[Coke]> Channel - please speak up if you know the four remaining voters and can point at contributions. you can go to their user page and look at contributions...

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> camstuart submitted a PR to Raku/examples, created some tickets for Cro, submitted a PR for raku-community-modules/raku-mime-types and already has write access to that particular repo

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> maybe more. Seems like a new user acting in good faith, I'll invite them

[20:42] <AlexDaniel> that's it. I don't know the others and can't find their contributions

[20:42] <guifa> [Coke]: sorry about that!

[20:44] <guifa> and AlexDaniel ty for the invite

[20:47] <AlexDaniel> guifa: so that I don't forget later, can I invite you to the Raku team now? (is autosubscribe feature turned off?)

[20:47] <guifa> AlexDaniel: you just did :-) (I’m alabamenhu)

[20:48] <guifa> someone squated guifa on GH haha

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> guifa: no, I only added you to the “Everyone” team

[20:48] <guifa> ah

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> which has access to just docs and https://github.com/Raku/please-turn-off-the-autowatch-feature :)

[20:49] <guifa> Aaaah haha

[20:49] <AlexDaniel> reason for that is that people were very unhappy in the past :)

[20:53] <guifa> AlexDaniel: I’ve made the mistake before of not turning off notifications.  CLDR lists will be quiet for weeks and then next thing you know you’ve got 200 messages in less than an hour

[20:57] <El_Che> I just disabled mails

[21:10] <rypervenche> codesections: Ahhh, I've got all of my machines in Chinese (locale zh-TW) except for the one that works, which is in English. The $USER variable works correctly on all machines. But the output of "id" gives "使用者id=1000(rypervenche)" instead of "uid=1000(rypervenche)"

[21:11] <rypervenche> And I don't set the USER variable anywhere.

[21:14] <stoned75> $*USER is set with a regex on id's output...

[21:14] <codesections> rypervenche: Interesting!  I wonder why `id` is involved?  I would have guessed that $*USER was just reading USER directly

[21:14] <codesections> stoned75: any idea why?

[21:15] <stoned75> see src/core.c/Process.pm6 

[21:15] <stoned75> no I do not known why it is implemented this way

[21:16] <stoned75> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Process.pm6#L81

[21:18] <stoned75> I supposed a quick fix would be something like:

[21:18] <stoned75> -        once if !Rakudo::Internals.IS-WIN && try { qx/id/ } -> $id {

[21:18] <stoned75> +        once if !Rakudo::Internals.IS-WIN && try { qx/env LANG=C id/ } -> $id {

[21:19] <timotimo> we would possibly want to use getgrgid or something on linux, but putting nativecall directly into the setting .. dunno if great idea

[21:19] <tellable6> 2020-09-20T20:16:26Z #raku <patrickb> timotimo Do you have a specific question about relocatability or do you want a general explanation?

[21:19] <timotimo> moar could expose it, or a rakudo extop

[21:19] <codesections> Hmm, either way, it seems like a bug.  Either that quick fix, an update to the regex, or a fallback to the USER env var

[21:20] <stoned75> I suspected as much (that using nativecall is not a good idea)

[21:21] <codesections> the *very* quick fix for this particular situation would be adding `.*?` to the start of the regex 

[21:21] <codesections> But I have no idea if the output of `id` can vary in other ways in different locales 

[21:22] <stoned75> hence fixing the locale :)

[21:24] <rypervenche> I'll submit an issue at least.

[21:24] <stoned75> that's the thing to do :)

[21:26] <stoned75> m: use NativeCall;sub getuid() returns int32 is native { * }; say getuid;

[21:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «1017␤»

[21:26] <stoned75> works nicely :)

[21:27] <stoned75> ah well $*USER is the username... by bad :)

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I did invite camstuart (reasoning above)

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> as for everyone else in that list, I think they should submit some PRs first :)

[23:37] <codesections> weekly: https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-unicode/

[23:37] <notable6> codesections, Noted! (weekly)

[23:44] <moon-child> ah - does 'commit bit' just mean 'has a commit' (merged by someone else)?

[23:45] <moon-child> I took it to mean 'has commit privileges'

[23:47] <[Coke]> correct. for voting, you need a bit, not just a merged PR

[23:48] <[Coke]> sorry: no, "commit bit" does not mean "has a commit"

[23:49] <[Coke]> it means you have permission to commit. You can have a merged PR (and therefore a commit) without having the "bit"

[23:51] <[Coke]> that leaves 4 IDs that had ballots but no commit bits. Can we get someone other than AlexDaniel to look at those IDs, please (not that i don't appreciate AlexDaniel doing the work on those 2, but he's a candidate, so...)

[23:53] <[Coke]> 48 ballots reporting (Average votes per ballot: 4.67)

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> moon-child: it's a bit random. Sometime people submit one PR and get invited, other times people do a lot of noticeable contributions but don't get invited

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> sometimes*

[23:55] <AlexDaniel> I think it's a good opportunity to notice that some people were not invited, so I invite them :)

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> perl6 org had 323 members, it is very inclusive

[23:57] <[Coke]> of the remaining ones, fecundf has the most activity, it seems.

[23:57] <AlexDaniel> (fwiw all of them were invited to Raku/)

[23:58] <[Coke]> voting closes in 2 minutes.

[23:58] <[Coke]> I'll keep the results under wraps for a day, giving us some time to deal with the remaining voters who don't have bits. If we decide they get bits, I'll enable their ballots that were submitted on time.

[23:59] <AlexDaniel> 👍
