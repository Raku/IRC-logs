[10:57] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: When model name contains :   the table alias will become  xxx::yy::model,  And this will raise error. Is this a known bug?

[10:57] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: or I missed something there.

[10:57] <xinming_> Let's say,   model App::Model::XXX is table<xxx> { ... }     <--- This worked pretty fine, as long as people don't try .join-model

[12:08] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: you can use `is table<new_name>` for that. There is also 2 experimental features changing that: https://fco.github.io/Red/tutorials/experimental.html

[12:13] <SmokeMachine> Oh, is .join-model is breaking on that case? Thatâ€™s a bug... Iâ€™ll fix that ASAP

[13:17] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: I already opened that case, And will later do some doc help on Red.

[13:19] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: I believe there is a hidden bug, which might cause Red tries to use FALLBACK

[13:19] <xinming_> $*RED-FALLBACK var.

[13:21] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: after we fix that issue, I'll continue digging into next one.

[21:21] <holyghost> Hi

[21:21] <holyghost> if I would have to link in libqt into raku what's the OO interface thingie then ?

[21:22] <holyghost> to interface I mean

[21:29] <holyghost> I probably do not need all the functions, but it's for 3D of my pagan package

[21:29] <holyghost> I can also do mesa/GL

[21:30] <holyghost> or OGRE
