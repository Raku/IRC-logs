[14:36] <leont> Apparently enums in general

[14:36] <leont> Given I type object, I want to be able to convert strings into values of that enum, or die trying

[14:39] <lizmat> hmmm.....

[14:40] <jnthn> Order(...) only expects the enum value, not its name; we shouldn't confuse those two, othewise things will get really weird on string-based enums

[14:41] <evalable6> jnthn, rakudo-moar c9d9a096e: OUTPUT: «Order::Same␤»

[14:41] <jnthn> Do it like that to find it by name

[14:43] <lizmat> jnthn: I think the actual enum type can only be derived from a value in a variable in leont 's case

[14:44] <leont> Yeah, I have a $order = Order as a starting point

[14:45] <lizmat> leont: is that what you mean, or am I misunderstanding ?

[14:46] <leont> I have «my $order = Order; my $name = "Same";», I want to make Order::Same out of that

[14:58] <daxim> do we have a (directed) graph module?  need to find all nodes that are not successors to a certain node.  I don't want to code it myself if it can be helped

[14:59] *** jaldhar joined
[14:59] *** dansolo42 joined
[14:59] <jnthn> I don't think so. I did implement such a think as a util in some project a while back, but it only had a couple of algorithms that I needed.

[15:00] <jnthn> Did think to release it at some point and enjoy implementing a bunch more graph algos along the way, but...as usual, too many things to do.

[15:02] <jaldhar> Hello.  I missed a couple of the weekly challenges over Christmas so I'm going back and doing them now.  I did challenge 038 and ran into an interesting situation.

[15:02] <jaldhar> Am I right in thinking there is no way to return "undef" from a grammar action class?

[15:03] <jaldhar> You can return Nil (and I did) but it is not the same thing.

[15:05] <leont> Seems I can't add a returns trait whose type argument is a value? «sub foo() returns($type) {}»

[15:06] <leont> Working around it for now by calling trait-mod:<returns>(&foo, $type), it feels a bit clunky

[15:06] <jnthn> Only if $type is a constant (and so available at compile itme)

[15:06] <jnthn> Since traits are applied at compile time

[15:06] <leont> Right, that does make sense

[15:06] <leont> trait-mod:<returns>(&foo, $type) it is then

[15:09] <jaldhar> The reason why one would want that is that you can test if a grammar parsed correctly by $parsed = $grammar.parse(); if $parsed... but if you add extra validation in an action class, you end up having to do  $parsed = $grammar.parse(); if $parsed && $parsed.made which is unsightly.

[15:10] <jaldhar> Not a huge problem as things go but I was wondering about this.

[15:10] <jnthn> jaldhar: The return values of grammar actions are ignored; only `make` is useful for attaching anything

[15:10] *** reach_satori joined
[15:11] <jaldhar> jnthn: So I used make Nil to signify that validation has failed.  But ideally I would want make undef.  It does not seem to be possible.

[15:12] <jnthn> There is no undef

[15:14] <jaldhar> There should be some way of saying this AST (or match object?) is empty.  After all isn't that what you get if you fail a regex or a grammar without actions?

[15:14] *** aluaces left
[15:18] <jaldhar> IIRC in yacc grammars there is a routine you can specify to mean "Game over man. halt parsing."  I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be a simple way to do that in Raku.

[15:19] *** sftp left
[15:20] <lizmat> die ?

[15:20] <lizmat> grammars are just code

[15:21] <jnthn> If you don't call `make` then you won't have set a .made. But ultimately there's two levels here: the parse tree and the AST.

[15:22] *** holli joined
[15:23] <jaldhar> lizmat: would that exit out of the grammar parse or out of the script altogether?  But I just remembered that Raku has exceptions.  Maybe throwing an exception is the right way to do this?

[15:24] <lizmat> put a CATCH block in the same scope as where you do the parse

[15:25] *** Doc_Holliwould left
[15:25] <lizmat> m: CATCH { say "reviving"; .resume }; die; say "alive again"

[15:25] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar c9d9a096e: OUTPUT: «reviving␤alive again␤»

[15:26] <jaldhar> lizmat: ok just read about all that. die is how exceptions are thrown and CATCH {} is how they are caught.

[15:27] *** mowcat joined
[15:27] <jaldhar> Well, I had solved my initial problem but I shall file this away in brain for future reference.

[15:29] *** wamba joined
[15:29] <lizmat> if you make your own Exception class, you can actually put information in there that you could use in the CATCH block to react

[16:58] <holli> how do i write a generic class in Raku? class f[::t] {} doesnt compile

[17:01] <Altai-man_> holli, you write generic roles with role Foo[::T] { ...something with T... } and then `class Bar does Foo[Int] { ...use things from Foo role... }`

[17:02] <holli> wait, you can use a role from the body of the class?

[17:02] <leont> Apparently you can do this with a «method ^parameterize», not sure if that's in the spec though

[17:02] <jnthn> Sorta, but please just write a role.

[17:03] <Altai-man_> holli, can you share a simple pseudocode sample of what you want so we could help with it?

[17:03] <leont> Fair enough

[17:04] <holli> in the end i would like my @linked-list[Something] = (Something.new(1), Something.new(2), Something.new(3) ); @linked-list.add-node(2, Something(4) );

[17:05] <holli> basically implement a linked list and make it look and behave like an array/hash

[17:05] <holli> i'm just pondering ideas for the weekly challenge

[17:06] <jmerelo> holli: you can also "pun" or directly instantiate that kind of parametrized roles.
