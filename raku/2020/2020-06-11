[15:11] <melezhik> we are trying to figure out one baffling bug with Alpine/SQLite/DBIish/Docker , I wonder if it rakudo related ? raku devs help would be appreciated - https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish/issues/190

[16:08] <moritz> for the record, I got some help in private message regarding my question earlier. Turns out I had to install some build dependencies (build-essential and libperl-dev)

[16:09] <melezhik> moritz, yeah Inline::Perl requires system packages, for RakuDist I use that one - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/modules/default/files/patches/Inline::Perl5/sparrowfile

[16:10] <melezhik> and probably something else, like make, c compiler , but that is all covered by this list - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/dockers/ubuntu/sparrowfile

[16:10] *** leah2 left
[16:11] *** chloekek joined
[16:14] <moritz> melezhik: I was lazy enough to just use `build-essential`, which includes make, gcc, a linker, dunno what else

[16:17] <moritz> actually, could reduce to libc-dev make gcc

[16:18] *** softmoth left
[16:23] <melezhik> moritz, sure, RakuDist supports now alpine/centos/ubuntu/debian , so for various platforms there are various requirements

[16:24] <melezhik> this is why I have patches systems for certain modules, for example - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/tree/master/modules/default/files/patches

[16:24] <melezhik> so either have some common requirements defined when one bootstrap docker instance - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/tree/master/dockers

[16:25] <melezhik> or some patches that address specific needs if required - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/tree/master/modules/default/files/patches

[17:37] <[Coke]> Will be hard to sell anyone else at work on using Raku, though.

[17:37] *** soursBot joined
[17:38] <timotimo> yeah we'll probably have to investigate this thoroughly

[17:38] <[Coke]> as time permits, happy to test stuff.

[17:41] <timotimo> then you didn't input it the same way i did, LOL

[17:42] <[Coke]> I cut and pasted from your gist

[17:42] <timotimo> damn, it didn't copy over huh?

[17:43] <[Coke]> ... I *thought* I did, one sec.

[17:53] <raku-bridge> <Rustem B.> i curl this from gist and hexize it

[17:54] <raku-bridge> <Rustem B.> thereis inviz syms instead of space 😄

[18:00] <timotimo> interesting! so copy-pasting into the browser worked, and sending it up to gist also worked (would be terrible if gist would "clean" your data for you tbh) but copying it *out* of the browser somehow missed the special values

[18:00] <ShimmerFairy> is that utf-c8 striking again?

[18:01] <timotimo> using $foo<no-break-space here> gives me an entry in the lex pad that is just $foo, so it isn't considered part of the identifier

[18:01] <timotimo> which would have been a fantastic surprise

[18:02] <timotimo> but you're right, what about b0rked input into -e

[18:03] <timotimo> i don't have a simple, reliable way to generate some silly stuff that utf8-c8 would turn into "special stuff"

[18:04] <ShimmerFairy> I encountered the same problem trying to type something like ä (that is, in decomposed form) as an arg to -e and it fell apart. Note that the precomposed form ä works, and things that require NFG to be one character (like s̈) work too.

[18:04] <ShimmerFairy> *same kind of problem

[18:20] <timotimo> ok, if we take @*ARGS in as utf8-c8 encoded, we'd be getting the string that has the private-use characters there

[18:20] <timotimo> and those aren't allowed inside of identifiers

[18:21] <dominix> hi everyone. I would like to have a list of system modules provided with rakudo-star (the link is broken on web site)

[18:21] <dominix> where do I get it from ?

[18:22] <timotimo> m: $*OUT.write('my $a'.encode("utf8") ~ uniparse("COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT").encode("utf8")

[18:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar f627d2c85: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in argument list; couldn't find final ')' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3"COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT").encode("utf8")7⏏5<EOL>␤»

[18:22] <timotimo> m: $*OUT.write('my $a'.encode("utf8") ~ uniparse("COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT").encode("utf8"))

[18:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar f627d2c85: OUTPUT: «my $à»

[18:23] <timotimo> OK, when i put the a with the combining grave accent separately in the commandline, it'll give the error about the private use characters

[18:23] <timotimo> i feel like we really ought to put something into our parse error messages that handles those, because it's absolutely ungoogleable

[18:23] <moritz> dominix: http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/5ee276a4.753e.33d from the rakudo-star:2020.1 docker image

[18:24] <timotimo> we may want to have a little thread in the problem-solving repository

[18:24] <dominix> thanks moritz

[18:25] <timotimo> when i put the same string into a file and invoke it from the commandline, it apparently gets decoded as utf8 without c8, so combined and uncombined $à both refer to the same thing there

[18:25] <timotimo> at best it's a surprising inconsistency between -c and running from file

[19:01] <jdv79> any easy way to see what is using so much mem?

[19:02] *** wamba left
[19:03] <jdv79> i have what is basically a concurrent http crawler and /usr/bin/time -v says:  Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2066912

[19:04] *** wamba joined
[19:07] <MasterDuke> best bet is a heap snapshot

[19:07] <timotimo> annoyingly, "max resident set size" is literally the max over the lifetime of the process

[19:08] <timotimo> so you can't easily tell if it's just growing without bounds, or if it has reached a peak and went down again

[19:08] <timotimo> but yes, heap snapshot can help you there

[19:08] <timotimo> either run the process with heap snapshot profiling turned on, i.e. --profile=/tmp/blah.mvmheap, or use the function from the Telemetry module that i think it has?

[19:12] <jdv79> timotimo: even so, max is relevant in terms of resource constraints

[19:13] <jdv79> and that's why i'm interested actually aka "where can i or can't i run this thing"

[19:15] <timotimo> true

[19:15] <timotimo> OTOH, if you have swap, and the main use of memory is just a huge array of integers where you do sequential accesses or so, that's a different thing

[19:16] <jdv79> the --profile=/tmp/blah.mvmheap addition seems to kill its speed

[19:17] <jdv79> might take forever to complete:)

[19:17] <jdv79> how do i use htat file when it does

[19:17] <timotimo> that flag will run a heap snapshot collection on every GC run, which may be Often™

[19:18] <timotimo> there's a commandline tool for it, and there's a web app tool for it

[19:18] <jdv79> based on how fast the term is being written to i'd say i have about 30-45m til its done

[19:18] <timotimo> the first is called App::MoarVM::HeapAnalyzer (iirc), the other is moarperf

[19:18] <jdv79> ah, moarperf - i have that around

[19:18] <jdv79> cool

[19:18] <timotimo> you should be able to kill it in the middle and still get A Result that may be interesting

[19:18] <timotimo> if the program's run is kind of homogenuous all in all

[19:19] <timotimo> BBIAB

[19:19] <jdv79> ok

[19:20] <timotimo> https://wakelift.de/2019/09/12/progressing-with-progress/ the screenshot under "Frontend Work" here is the first thing you'll see with your heap snapshot loaded

[19:20] <timotimo> i.e. a graph showing how the counts of objects by type evolve

[19:20] <timotimo> the same for frames

[19:34] <atroxaper> I have a question about Raku compiler's Grammar. Is there a reason to mention the vws token only in under unsp token but not under _ws token too as it did for unv? Because of that, a VSC conflict will be detected only after the escape symbol.

[19:34] <atroxaper> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp#L703

[19:40] <dominix> On macOS, mojave I got an error installing REadline [Readline]     # Cannot locate native library '(null)': dlopen(libreadline.7.dylib, 10): image not found

[19:40] <dominix> it look like on Mojave there is libreadline.8.dylib but not 7

[19:41] <[Coke]> so, a local build of raku on windows against HEAD was just fine, so it's just star, not rakudo

[19:41] <[Coke]> dominix: pretty sure there's an open ticket about that. one sec.

[19:42] <[Coke]> ugh. we need to adopt Readline if we haven't already. :( :( :( :(

[19:42] <jdv79> isn't LineNoise an alternative?

[19:42] <atroxaper> dominix: I use only Linenoise on my Mac.

[19:43] <jdv79> i have no idea, don't use the repl - feels like i've heard that

[19:43] <[Coke]> dominix: https://github.com/drforr/perl6-readline/issues/20 is not quite the same, but similar issue on os x

[19:49] <dominix> thank atroxaper Coke, I'll install Linenoise, but that's not convenient, cause I got receipe with ReadLine that I depend on ...

[19:49] <dominix> Linenoise install with no errors

[19:53] <jdv79> timotimo: i overshot - was 23m

[20:00] *** Cabanossi left
[20:04] <jdv79> that heap file is 21G. wonder if moarperf will handle it.

[20:06] <MasterDuke> heh, how much ram do you have?

[20:06] <timotimo> wow

[20:06] <timotimo> well, it only reads the stuff you ask for

[20:07] *** Cabanossi joined
[20:07] <timotimo> depending on how many snaps it took, it could be just fine with not terribly much ram

[20:07] <timotimo> and it doesn't transfer very much to the browser, either

[20:07] <jdv79> timotimo: https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1319622

[20:08] <timotimo> oh, very interesting!

[20:08] <timotimo> i don't think i've seen this kind of error yet

[20:08] <jdv79> sweet

[20:08] *** lichtkind left
[20:09] <timotimo> can you give me the git commit or release or whatevery ou're on? alternatively just a sha1sum or whatever of lib/HeapAnalyzerWeb.pm6?

[20:09] <jdv79> its the one you made... hold on

[20:09] <timotimo> oh ... i wonder if it comes with the moarvm heapanalyzer module with commits i made, or if it uses the version jonathan has on his repo

[20:09] <timotimo> that could be trouble perhaps

[20:12] <timotimo> OK, it'd do that if it throws after line 39, so perhaps in self.request-snapshot(0)

[20:13] <timotimo> ah, no, it does output "done"

[20:13] <timotimo> wonder where that's from

[20:14] <timotimo> ah, it made it out of sub load-file, but after that it asplodes

[20:15] <jdv79> did it eat too much data?

[20:16] <timotimo> shouldn't be a problem, i hope!

[20:16] <timotimo> the CATCH inside of the inner .then would have .say'd the exception, so that's probably not what happened

[20:16] <timotimo> but it's possible that model-overview threw

[20:17] *** chloekek left
[20:17] <timotimo> can you put a CATCH { .say } into line 122 (make sure it doesn't change the return value, use explicit return statement if needed)

[20:18] *** lichtkind left
