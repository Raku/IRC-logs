[11:40] <moritz> Scalars leaked: -2

[11:40] <moritz> Inline::Perl5 continues to amaze :D

[11:41] <[Coke]> indeed!

[11:45] <moritz> sadly, this puts me in kind of a in a tight spot regarding the "Raku Fundamentals" book

[11:45] <moritz> one chapter of Perl 6 Fundamentals was based on an example with Inline::Python

[11:45] <moritz> ... which uses Python 2, which I cannot use in a new book. My attempts to port it to Python 3 are stalled

[11:46] <moritz> now I tried to change from python + matplotlib to Perl 5 + Chart::Clicker, but I keep running into problems with that as well

[11:47] <El_Che> moritz: what's the state of inline go? it may ne more trendy

[11:47] <El_Che> be

[11:47] <moritz> I could try GD::Graph + Inline::Perl5, though that produces super ugly charts

[11:47] <moritz> El_Che: my Go knowledge is at ~ zero, so that's not something I want to present in a book :D

[11:47] <El_Che> ah ok :)

[11:47] <[Coke]> Old Man Coke remembers when Tcl was the integration language of choice, yes.

[11:48] <El_Che> keeping pyhton2 out of the book makes sensem though

[11:48] <lizmat> moritz: perhaps report the issues with the Inline::Perl5 queue ?

[11:48] *** kensanata joined
[11:50] <moritz> lizmat: have already started with that

[11:50] <moritz> but I'm kinda on a deadline :(

[11:51] * [Coke] wonders if martinfowler.com is the same MF from CPAN.

[11:52] <[Coke]> moritz: are you using HEAD? (can you for a book?)

[11:52] *** jjatria left
[11:52] *** soursBot joined
[11:53] <moritz> [Coke]: no, I'm using the version that `zef install` gives me

[11:56] <[Coke]> I was thinking "of rakudo", but I think you answered the right question.

[11:57] *** jjatria joined
[11:57] <[Coke]> Might it be worth crowd sourcing your issues with chart clicker here?

[11:58] <[Coke]> If you're anything like me, that deadline is looming pretty close at this point. :)

[11:58] <moritz> http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/5ee36dda.529a.3ae that's one of my attempts

[12:00] <moritz> I've tried a pretty direct translation (without the perl 5 block, just method calls from raku) and ran into https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/issues/153

[12:00] *** rbt left
[12:01] *** rbt joined
[12:04] <moritz> oh, I've also tried Chart::Gnuplot, and it uses imagemagick to convert some stuff, which fails with an obscure error message about not having permissions. Googling for that suggestions you need to edit some XML in some file in /etc/ to give imagemagick permission to do its thing

[12:04] <moritz> this is a big cluster of WTFs and yak shaving, and I'm really frustrated

[12:04] <moritz> I think I'll ask the publisher about dropping that chapter entirely, and instead do something with a Cro webservice or so

[12:07] <[Coke]> You have my vote!

[12:08] <moritz> and my axe!

[12:09] <El_Che> moritz: I think itś aa great idea amd more "fundamental"

[12:13] <moritz> ok, then I need an idea for a somwhat practical-ish web service that can be implemented in one to two pages

[12:13] <moritz> I'm open to suggestions :D

[12:16] <moritz> mail to publisher sent

[12:20] <El_Che> api with apikeys?

[12:22] <[Coke]> moritz: A mini data wrangling service that can take a CSV file and parse a recipe to delete columns or combine them.

[12:23] <[Coke]> small grammar, exposure to Text::CSV... can extend later with more recipe verbs...

[12:23] <moritz> [Coke]: that's a nice idea

[12:23] <[Coke]> \o/

[12:24] <[Coke]> If you're really bored, use the power query language spec. :)

[12:25] <moritz> at $work we have a tool called `csv-filter` which I can also use as inspiration

[12:25] <[Coke]> this reminds me: does raku have parquet support yet?

[12:26] <[Coke]> looks like no. That sounds like a fun project I could work on that might help at $dayjob some day

[12:57] <jnthn> .oO( I dunno what parquet is, but it sounds pretty floored... )

[12:59] <[Coke]> it's a columnar based file format for tabular data.

[13:00] <[Coke]> nice for big data applications where you might be doing things to a whole column at once, rather than a single row.

[13:00] <jnthn> Ah, interesting

[13:47] <raku-bridge> <Vendethiel> AlexDaniel: I was looking at unbitrotting my modules, and started with raku/ecosystem-unbitrot#520, but I can't reproduce the failure on my machine. Seems like it was a VM bug that got fixed. What's the best course of action here?

[13:49] <raku-bridge> <Vendethiel> (also, Hi!)

[13:53] *** kensanata left
[13:54] <Altai-man_> If it works on latest, can close the ticket with stating that.

[13:55] <Altai-man_> Another nice thing to do is to set up a travis config with latest and also add a hook to re-run it maybe once in a month even without new commits, but efforts and that's on it, I guess. :)

[19:19] <suman> if int count(string s, char c) is the C function

[19:19] <suman> what is the mapping of char in raku nativecall?

[19:20] <thundergnat> suman: Is the library named 'libtest' or 'liblibtest'? Try just using a library name of 'test'. The default library loader prepends lib to the name.

[19:21] *** finanalyst joined
[19:22] <suman> @thundergnat I am on windows and synamic library is named libtest.dll

[19:30] <ctilmes> suman: std::string is not compatible with Raku Str marshaling

[19:31] <ctilmes> You need to pass it in as a C String like 'const char *'

[19:31] <suman> @ctilmes So that means I cannot use C++11

[19:31] <tellable6> 2020-06-12T19:24:58Z #raku <thundergnat> suman: no, I just am somewhat familiar with native calling external libraries.

[19:32] <ctilmes> Just write a little function to convert it

[19:33] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[19:35] <ctilmes> If you are writing the function using the string, just call str().  If you are using some other routine, create a wrapper function that converts it then calls the other routine

[19:35] <suman> ctilmes OK I will have a look at that. In function "int count(string s, char c)" signature what is corresponding raku type for char

[19:35] <suman> Any idea?

[19:35] <ctilmes> you can probably use int8 for char

[19:36] <ctilmes> or uint8

[19:38] <ctilmes> Yeah: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24826936/c11-internal-stdstring-representation-libstdc If you want to manually create a string on the Raku side you probably could, but I wouldn't recommend it

[19:39] <ctilmes> It's possible that a future Raku could support that type, but you need to find someone with both the need and ability to implement it

[19:42] <ctilmes> However you try to make a std::string in Raku will likely be non-standard https://shaharmike.com/cpp/std-string/

[22:41] <oddp> Might be blind, but looking through the range docs, one example mentions `Range.new(3, 5)`. Where exactly in the docs do I find more information about the actual paramaters I can pass?

[22:41] <oddp> Example here: https://docs.raku.org/type/Range#method_ACCEPTS

[22:46] <oddp> m: Range.new("...")

[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5b507c8ad: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller new(Range:U: Str:D); none of these signatures match:␤    (Range: Range $min, \max, :$excludes-min, :$excludes-max, *%_)␤    (Range: \min, Range $max, :$excludes-min, :$excludes-max, *%_)␤    (Range: Seq \min, \max, :$exclud…»

[22:46] <oddp> Looking for the docs for all these options.

[22:58] <MasterDuke> oddp: i don't see it in the docs, but here's the source https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/rakuast/src/core.c/Range.pm6#L23-L78

[23:03] <oddp> Thank you! Alright, didn't overlook anything, after all, just wanted to make sure.

[23:04] <oddp> Is there a specific reason for not including them?

[23:04] <oddp> Not just in ranges.

[23:05] <MasterDuke> not that i know of. i'd suggest creating an issue in the docs repo
