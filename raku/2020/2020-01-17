[02:30] <tyil> does anyone know why this happens, and how I can make it not do that?

[03:25] <ryan48> what is the best way to do a system wide install? i was going to move the rakudo dir to /opt and then make symbolic links of the binaries to /usr/local/bin, but it seems moving the entire rakudo dir breaks the binaries...

[03:33] <ryan48> ubuntu 18.04. the rakudo in the repos is pretty old... 2018.03. I can't remember for sure, but I think there are things that strarted working better for us in v6.d... and we have use v6.d in a lot of modules now...

[03:37] <AlexDaniel> hmm why is that ubuntu focal has 2018.12

[03:37] <ryan48> AlexDaniel: that looks promising... thanks!

[03:38] <AlexDaniel> ryan48: by any chance do you know how it works in ubuntu? I'm looking at this: https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/rakudo

[03:38] <AlexDaniel> are they basing it off debian buster?

[03:39] <AlexDaniel> ryan48: like, can somebody ask them to update it?

[03:39] <AlexDaniel> would be nice to have the next LTS to include a recent-ish rakudo

[03:40] <AlexDaniel> not 2018.12, which is kinda alright too, but still

[03:40] <Grinnz> usually you need to tell the configure process what prefix it will be installed under, unless it's a relocatable build

[03:41] <Grinnz> no idea if that's set up but i think i saw conversation about it previously..

[03:41] <ryan48> I'm really not sure... I use arch on my personal computers, but am forced to use ubuntu LTS at work.... not super familiar with that stuff...

[03:54] <ryan48> AlexDaniel: rakudo-pkg worked perfectly. Thanks!

[03:58] <ryan48> wish that was listed on raku.org/rakudo.org... guess it's "unofficial, but still really nice

[03:59] <ryan48> well on second thought rakudo.org list 3rd party binaries for windows and mac... 

[04:01] <ryan48> rakudo-pkg even comes with zef and raku* binaries. Nice!

[07:02] <XexonixXexillion> Hi. What are some good resources for learning Raku?

[07:03] <El_Che> XexonixXexillion: it depends on you knowledge of programming and your learning style

[07:04] <El_Che> XexonixXexillion: think Raku can be downloaded for free (or bought) here: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/

[07:04] <El_Che> it a variant of the series like "Think Python"

[07:05] <El_Che> there is also Learning Perl 6 from O'reilly, Perl 6 Fundamentals and so on: https://perl6book.com/

[07:05] <El_Che> I would suggest though, to go to docs.raku.org and read the tutorials and start a very small project

[07:07] *** domidumont joined
[07:09] <XexonixXexillion> I like the flow chart on perl6book.com. But I'm not really looking for a book unless I can download it right now.

[07:09] <XexonixXexillion> I've worked as a software dev in C, Java, Node.js and Haskell at various times, so I'm not exactly new to programming

[07:10] <XexonixXexillion> but I don't know Perl5, and a lot of tutorials seems to assume that I do

[07:11] <XexonixXexillion> I've got a long train ride tomorrow, so I was hoping to spend it playing around with Raku

[07:11] *** AlexDani` joined

[07:21] <El_Che> jmerelo: your book in now on safari: Perl 6 Quick Syntax Reference

[07:22] <El_Che> XexonixXexillion: Think Raku can be downloaded legally and for free

[07:22] <El_Che> it doesn not assume perl 5 knowledge

[07:22] <El_Che> it may be too basic as it explain programming concepts, but it will be an easy walkthrough

[07:23] <El_Che> XexonixXexillion: libs: have a look at Cro

[07:23] <XexonixXexillion> El_Che it looked like it's not really about teaching Raku. It's about teaching programming and uses Raku to do so, but I've already downloaded a copy anyway

[07:24] <El_Che> XexonixXexillion: yes, you're right

[07:25] <El_Che> that's also why I meant walk through

[07:25] <El_Che> you just have a quick look how to do things with raku, eg syntax

[07:25] <El_Che> but don't need to get into programming concepts

[07:25] *** tadzik joined
[07:26] *** domidumont left
[07:26] <El_Che> Perl 6 Fundamentals was also a very nice and introduction, but I don't think it's available for free

[07:40] *** domidumont joined
[07:48] <tobs> not talking down the books that have already been written, but I was also missing such a "Raku for Polyglots" book which focuses on the models the language employs and what ties them together at the core, what mental model I should have of a Raku runtime.

[07:49] <tobs> most of what I learned in this regard came from lurking in this channel, probably a few blog posts, those big docs pages and talks.

[08:02] <moritz> tobs: my experience as an author is that the further you get away from intro books, the less they sell

[08:02] <moritz> I'm more proud of the regexes + grammars book than of Fundamentals, but being more niche, it sells far worse

[08:03] <moritz> so as much as I would enjoy both writing and having such a book, the economics basically forbid it

[16:21] <uzl[m]> lizmat: Thank you very much. I'll have a look whenever I've the time.

[16:25] <El_Che> uzl[m]: that's what linked in the page with perl6 in the url

[16:25] <El_Che> the pdf is called think_raku.pdf

[16:25] <El_Che> 2nd Edition, Version 0.6

[16:25] <El_Che> January 2020

[16:26] <El_Che> \o/ for laurent

[17:01] <melezhik> RakuDistApi now can test Raku modules from github:

[17:01] <melezhik> curl -d os=debian -d project=edumentab/p6-app-moarvm-debug http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/api/run/:github

[17:02] <melezhik> refined documentation - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist#run-tests-via-api

[17:05] <El_Che> melezhik: with your config mgmt tool as a backend?

[17:06] <melezhik> yeah

[17:07] <melezhik> you have 2 options, 1) run it low level ( your custom scenarios ) through sparrowdo/docker 2) run it through API using curl

[17:07] <melezhik> in both cases test scenarios are written in Sparrow6 and executed inside docker containers 

[17:07] <El_Che> uzl[m]: it was just meant as a fyi not as a 'I am right" :)

[17:08] <El_Che> melezhik: interesting

[17:08] <El_Che> melezhik: specially the curl one :)

[17:08] <El_Che> melezhik: I have been too busy to have a look :(

[17:08] <melezhik> yeah, you can take it for a spin right now, no coding is needed at all!

[17:09] <El_Che> melezhik: that is great. I think that people like me and you sometime forget that not everyone is into containers and stuff :)

[17:12] <melezhik> El_Che: thanks. Yeah containers are cheap and fast 

[17:13] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: any way we can quickly add support for custom rakudo versions ?

[17:13] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: like maybe through https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Shareable or something like that

[17:15] <AlexDaniel> like, I want to be able to do curl -d rakudo=33993023 os=debian -d project=edumentab/p6-app-moarvm-debug http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/api/run/:github

[17:15] <melezhik> AlexDaniel: good idea. Basically we just need plug this into current sparrowdo bootstrap - https://github.com/melezhik/sparrowdo/blob/master/resources/bootstrap.sh 

[17:15] <melezhik> AlexDaniel: sure !

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: ‚Üë

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: a very cool tool for release managers, once that is available

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: also have you seen https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot ?

[17:17] <melezhik> No, what is that in 2 words?

[17:17] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: if rakudist is so easy to use with curl, I can adjust the template so that it says ‚ÄúRerun tests in RakuDist: https://‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: it's basically an issue tracker for modules that don't pass tests

[17:18] <melezhik> yeah,  good idea, I will need to prepare my azure VM  for higher load then ((=:

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: so out of 1482 modules in the ecosystem roughly 220 don't work, and that repo is for figuring out what's up with them and trying to fix them

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: no need for higher load I think, the testing and stuff comes from Blin and we handle that

[17:19] <melezhik> now I have enabled requests throttling to avoid  server down. 220 module is doable though, let me think ...

[17:19] <melezhik> Alex - ok

[17:19] *** wildtrees joined
[17:20] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: but a lot of the times people wonder if the status changed or if it's still broken and stuff like this, and being able to replay the tests is pretty cool

[17:20] <melezhik> yeah, this is the very idea behind RakuDist

[17:21] <melezhik> Alex, sorry I need to switch to my main work, but lets figure out details latter 

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: btw here's the list of deps that are needed for modules: https://github.com/Raku/Blin/blob/master/docker/pkg-dependencies

[17:22] <melezhik> ok, noted ... 

[17:22] *** jmerelo joined
[17:22] <AlexDaniel> talk to you later then :)

[17:28] *** rindolf joined
[17:30] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it's a moving target, but module authors could define it for the oses they care about

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> that's what I'm thinking too

[18:46] <[Coke]> also don't need block around conditional in if.

[18:46] <Poohman> got it 

[18:47] <[Coke]> You got close, though. think you were just missing the ; on the last there. (and that's only due to the one-liner, I think)

[18:47] <Grinnz> since raku cares more about whitespace, please tell me "$ foo" is not supported :)

[18:47] *** melezhik joined
[18:48] <Poohman> yes, the example in the documentation did not have it, maybe it was because it was not a one liner

[18:48] <Poohman> thanks

[18:49] <guifa> Grinnz I was almost about to say you could do $\      foo, but ‚Ä¶¬†nope.  That‚Äôs more limited than I thought

[18:49] <Grinnz> sometimes limits are good

[21:15] <tbrowder> pardon the  noise but i just started a PR guide (a WIP) to help folks (like Todd) who've never done such a thing--feel free to add, subtract, or multiply. i'm going to do further updates now through PRs or pushes from my fork and clone of this repo. i'm no expert as AlexDaniel can attest, but i can at least help with an initial working setup

[21:19] <AlexDaniel> there are many guides out there on how to use github

[21:27] <tbrowder> i'm certainly open to suggestions, but i want a cookbook recipe for the doc repo for Todd so we can keep him better focused

[21:27] <tbrowder> so until something better is found, i'll keep working on it
