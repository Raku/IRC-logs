[02:51] *** xinming_ left
[02:52] <rypervenche> Guess I'll do that then.

[02:52] *** xinming_ joined
[02:54] <timotimo> i mean, if you have a grammar you may have different ways to react to how you parsed the input

[02:54] <timotimo> even in a normal regex, you can use code blocks inside an alternation

[02:57] <rypervenche> Yeah, I'm using a regex. Oh! I should probably be doing this in a with statement actually.

[02:58] <guifa> What about

[02:58] <guifa> $<integer>.?Int instead?

[02:59] <guifa> Weird.  That still produces it

[03:00] <guifa> Also, I thought Nil was suppsoed to return Nil on all method calls ?

[03:00] <timotimo> isn't .?blah more about "does a blah method exist"

[03:02] <rypervenche> This is essentially what I'm working on. Just a little practice project. https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/8b325ef947ecd57cd35bda2b9a52ed0e

[03:05] <timotimo> ah

[03:05] <rypervenche> You'll have to excuse the poorly named variables as well, haha. I challenged myself to do a friend's homework in Raku. 

[03:05] <timotimo> i'd say the "with $<operator>" line is a good approach

[03:05] <timotimo> since that implies that something matched \d+

[03:05] *** xinming_ left
[03:06] <timotimo> in general, you could even put all the work into an actions class

[03:09] <rypervenche> Yeah, that might be better. Hmm, I'll have to create the variable outside of the with statement, or make it a dynamic variable if I want this to work this way...

[03:09] *** xinming_ joined
[03:09] <timotimo> grammars + action classes let you put parsing of input together with "reacting to the shape of parse results"

[03:12] <timotimo> if you move operator + operand into its literal own method that has only the two things, the corresponding action method will only ever be called when operator and operand are both valid

[03:13] <timotimo> alternatively, you can do the "code block inside of an alternation" thing i mentioned earlier, it's kind-of-sort-of the same thing as an action method

[03:17] <guifa> timeless: the .?Int is supposed to be see if the method exists, and if so, call it, otherwise, return Nil 

[03:18] <guifa> m: class A { method a { ‘aaa’ } }; say A.?a

[03:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «aaa␤»

[03:18] <guifa> m: class A { method a { ‘aaa’ } }; say A.?b

[03:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[03:20] * timeless looks up

[03:21] <timeless> nope. not me.

[03:21] <guifa> timeless: oops, sorry, meant timotimo 

[03:21] <guifa> I was too quick with the tab :-)

[03:21] <timeless> sorry about the delay, irccloud sends notifications to my phone on delay

[03:21] * timeless can be faster to complain ;-)

[03:52] *** ex_nihilo joined
[03:54] <rypervenche> Nice, used an actions and turned both possible outputs into a list.

[03:58] <rypervenche> And I think my last question for the night: There's no way to shorten this, is there? $!current-value = ($!current-value ÷ $num).Int;

[04:02] <timotimo> you can use div, that does integer division

[04:03] <moon-child> could go for $!current-value ÷= $num; $!current-value .= Int

[14:39] <pamplemousse> Like a snackbar at a deli, etc

[15:38] *** Possum joined

[16:00] *** sjaveed joined
[16:02] <guifa`> timotimo: yeah, I knew that, it's surprising I can't directly against a single parameter too

[16:02] * guifa` is creating a trait that allows for unordered positionals, assuming they're different types

[16:03] <guifa`> I can write a routine to do the check manually, just feels like it should be built in ha

[16:04] <timotimo> well, Parameter ~~ Parameter would surely check if one parameter accepts the same (or more?) things than another, but perhaps Any ~~ Parameter could do what you want?

[16:07] <guifa`> Yeah, that was what I had tried, but it just returns false for everything that's not a parameter.  Ah well.  

[16:07] <timotimo> right, it's not yet in the language obviously

[16:07] <timotimo> but a parameter should also let you get the type check stuff it has

[16:10] <guifa`> Doing it via smart match though would get you the weird case that you have a parameter whose type constraint is parameter.  But I guess Signature has the same issue probably.  I might code that up and see if folks think it worthy for core.

[18:07] <tellable6> 2020-09-23T18:25:11Z #raku <Xliff> andrzejku: However Raku's performance issues (particularly compiling) are offputting to most game developers.

[19:55] <guifa`> rypervenche: unfortunately, there's a few of them that require some extra work before the first compile is successful =/  I've got notes on all them, but a quick way to find them all is look for SlurpySentry and $! (private vars).  Annoying, I know

[19:55] <rypervenche> guifa`: I also noticed that your update scripts have pm6 hardcoded into them, but don't work since you renamed to rakumod.

[19:55] <guifa`> oops :-) 

[19:56] * guifa` has been a bit scatter brained lately 

[19:56] *** BenGoldberg left
[19:57] <rypervenche> Is generate-template the best way to get a template file? The README says there's a template.rakumod file there, so I guess that also needs to be updated.

[19:59] *** xinming joined
[20:00] <guifa`> That one I believe is the most updated one.

[20:00] <timotimo> well, i haven't brained at all lately

[20:00] <timotimo> so you're already ahead of me

[20:01] <guifa`> The issue is just that the template copys verbatin what's in the Exceptions.pm6 file

[20:01] <rypervenche> guifa`: You're saying that template.rakumod is the most up-to-date? Because it doesn't exist anymore.

[20:02] <guifa`> And a few of them reference private stuff, which causes an error until you switch them to public.  I'm just not sure yet how to consistently handle that on the generation
