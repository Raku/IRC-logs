[08:01] <SmokeMachine> .ask jnthn Hi! I was reading some RakuAST classes and wondering, if I do that walk with a multi on a custom parser, if I search for RakuAST::Statement::If will it find a RakuAST::Statement::With? is that expected? To match an if, will someone have to `RakuAST::Statement::If $ where * !~~ RakuAST::Statement::With`?

[08:01] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[08:02] *** sena_kun joined
[08:04] *** Altai-man_ left
[08:05] <SmokeMachine> .ask jnthn I'm still just wondering, sorry if interrupting, but would it make sense if there was something like RakuAST::Statement::Conditional that RakuAST::Statement::If and RakuAST::Statement::With would extend that?

[08:05] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[08:07] *** pecastro joined
[08:10] <SmokeMachine> .ask jnthn the same for RakuAST::Statement::Elsif and RakuAST::Statement::Orwith

[09:30] *** rawr is now known as grumble

[09:36] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: I went through a design ideas on that construct; the thing is that one can freely mix if/with with orwith/elsif in any combination whatsoever

[09:37] <jnthn> *a few design ideas

[09:37] <jnthn> e.g. if $foo { } orwith $bar { }

[09:37] <jnthn> Or with $foo { } elsif $bar { }

[09:37] <jnthn> So there's no real sense that they're a different construct.

[09:37] <jnthn> The grammar is equally telling; it's one production rule for the lot

[09:40] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: lizmat unassigned from jnthn Issue Could Raku benefit from a Flags type? https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/208

[09:42] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: but if we had a common ancestor of if and with and that had the elsif and orwith, wouldn't it do that? and wouldn't it be differentiable on walk?

[09:47] *** nebuchadnezzar left
[09:47] <jnthn> Hm, I guess it is a tad harder to find only `if`s if you don't want `with` as well

[09:47] <jnthn> I don't really know what to call the common ancestor, though...Conditional is odd because unless and without are also conditionals

[09:48] <jnthn> But they don't really fit into the pattern that the others do

[09:48] <jnthn> Could be Iffy or some such :)

[09:49] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/br25lyWp/

[09:50] <SmokeMachine> iffy and elsy? 

[09:53] <jnthn> It's more elsiffy :P

[09:53] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[09:53] <SmokeMachine> yes, sorry, my English doesn't help...

[09:56] <jnthn> .oO( it's fine, just a bit iffy... :) )

[09:57] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: is there a AST for metamethods? I mean, `Bla.^all`, how would that new translated?

[09:57] <jnthn> Perhaps a property on method call

[09:57] <jnthn> Or perhaps its own node time

[09:57] <jnthn> I'm undecided

[09:57] <jnthn> *node type

[09:59] <SmokeMachine> if it's a method call, the obj would be the metaclass? I mean, would it represent `Bla.HOW.all(Bla)`?

[10:00] <jnthn> It won't be desugared in RakuAST, no.

[10:00] <jnthn> So Bla.^all and Bla.HOW.all(Bla) will look different in the AST

[15:48] <tellable6> 2020-06-29T22:51:39Z #raku-dev <Altai-man_> melezhik I honestly think a blog post should tell a story or something, "why" is sometimes even more important than "How".

[15:48] *** zacts joined
[15:48] <melezhik> I'd like to hear some feedback before announce it publicly 

[15:49] <melezhik> Altai-man_ I belive there is some _why_ here ... however I see your point ..., maybe I'll add some more thoughts on that later 

[15:50] <melezhik> you saw a draft, but here is the wordpress version with some details for none devops people ...

[15:51] <melezhik> it always hard to have a balance between why and how / abstraction and implemation details ...

[17:36] <Kiki24> Hi !!! 

[17:36] <Kiki24> Im new to the lenguaje Raku, i'm come from scientific background with R 

[17:38] <Kiki24> i'm want to learn raku but before i want to know some things 

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> Kiki24: great! Feel free to ask :)

[17:39] <El_Che> Kiki24: feel free to ask, there are probably people around that can aswer your questio or we can ping them :)

[17:39] *** Cabanossi joined
[17:39] <Kiki24> raku has stats libraries already ? 

[17:39] <Kiki24> it it's possible plotting information ? 

[17:40] <El_Che> https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=PLOT

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> actually https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=stats

[17:43] *** sno joined
[17:44] <AlexDaniel> SVG::Plot is not very useful, maybe other modules are nicer

[17:45] *** reach_satori_ joined
[17:46] <Kiki24> AlexDaniel you known grammar of graphics (ggplot in R) ? 

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> Kiki24: no

[17:47] <Kiki24> its a package very simple for design plots in 2d 

[17:47] <Kiki24> it's something like i search, something simple for plot 

[17:48] <Kiki24> and possibily change the colors 

[17:48] <Kiki24> nothing fancy, but nothing something hard to learn 

[17:50] <Kiki24> for simple i mean easy to learn

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> Kiki24: I'm not sure. There's Chart::Gnuplot which looks promising

[23:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[23:51] <[Coke]> I assume I'm doing something dumb here.

[23:53] <timotimo> you'll want to return $b from the block

[23:53] <timotimo> m: sub off-by-one { ($^a-$^b).abs == 1; $b }; say [[&off-by-one]] <1 2 3 4> 

[23:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤4␤Useless use of "==" in expression ".abs == 1" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[23:53] <timotimo> oh, not quite

[23:53] <[Coke]> I wanted the boolean comparison chained.

[23:53] <timotimo> m: say [\-] <1 2 3 4> 

[23:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «(1 -1 -4 -8)␤»

[23:53] <timotimo> that's also not how

[23:54] <timotimo> i think you'll have to go with a rotor rather than just a reduce

[23:54] <timotimo> since reduce will turn two values into one by design

[23:54] <[Coke]> ... I do actually want them increasing, so the sub is too forgiving, anyway

[23:54] <timotimo> ah, ok

[23:54] <timotimo> in that case let me try another

[23:56] <timotimo> m: say <1 2 3 4>.rotor(2 => 1).map({ $^a - $^b == 1 }).all

[23:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «Too few positionals passed; expected 2 arguments but got 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «all(False)␤»

[23:56] <timotimo> m: say <1 2 3 4>.rotor(2 => 1).map(-> ($a, $b) { $a - $b == 1 })

[23:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f546ef6f: OUTPUT: «(False)␤»

[23:56] <timotimo> m: say <1 2 3 4>.rotor(2 => -1).map(-> ($a, $b) { $a - $b == 1 })
