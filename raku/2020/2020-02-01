[00:17] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> wow that's a name I haven't heard in a while

[00:17] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> sixels are awesomely confusing

[00:18] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> the jvm backend has more documentation than sixels tbh

[00:32] <MasterDuke> i  think timotimo has done some stuff with sixel

[00:34] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> yea I did some sixel stuff on repl.it back when it was supported (was removed when they got GUIs working)

[00:34] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> happened to do a thing in raku I think

[00:38] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> can't find the project but it existed

[19:39] *** zakharyas joined
[19:39] <guifa> I’m actually thinking about at some point doing a code documentation tutorial.  To me, it’s a strength of Raku to have it so tightly integrated, but it’s not as heavily used as I think it could be.  I probably over document my code (but for strictly following uninuitive standards it’s necessary, methinks)  but there’’s lots of important modules whose only documentation is in the README.md on github and that doesn’t benefit IDEs

[23:01] <rypervenche> I'm writing a little script to pull in a PSV file, parse out its parts, and then I want to store it somehow so that I can call all of the values later by giving it one of them. I'm guessing I need a something of hashes? Here is what the code looks like so far: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/373636fd7948b80e026dca7a80c7188f

[23:09] *** Kaiepi left
[23:10] *** Kaiepi joined
[23:15] <rypervenche> I know I could use an array of hashes and use the $<number>-1 as the array's element number. I'm not sure if that would be a smarter way to do it. I'd still be curious to know how to do it otherwise though.

[23:19] *** kensanata left
[23:22] *** Kaiepi left
[23:22] *** Kaiepi joined
[23:23] <TreyHarris> rypervenche: assuming the index isn't monotonically increasing, Array::Sparse would let you just use the number positionally. If it is monotonically increasing, any regular indexable will do

[23:36] <TreyHarris> But if it is monotonically increasing, you can afford to just leave the 0th item blank--you'd need to be judicious in your use of iterators and hypers so that the Nil works correctly. And you can iterate with `for @ary[1..*]:kv -> $id, $val`, like

[23:36] <TreyHarris> m: my @m = ('a', 1), ('c', 2), ('d', 3); for @m[1..*]:kv -> $k, ($f, $s) { say "$k: $f → $s" }

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar aaf9a93e4: OUTPUT: «1: c → 2␤2: d → 3␤»

[23:37] <TreyHarris> m: my @m = Nil, ('c', 2), ('d', 3); for @m[1..*]:kv -> $k, ($f, $s) { say "$k: $f → $s" }

[23:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar aaf9a93e4: OUTPUT: «1: c → 2␤2: d → 3␤»

[23:37] <TreyHarris> changing the first item to Nil doesn't matter since you slice from 1..*
