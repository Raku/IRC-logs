[15:43] <codesections> I've got a couple of (possibly dumb) questions that I haven't been able to find answers to in the docs: first, is there a way to `use` a module that isn't currently in the module search path?  For example, if I'm in the REPL and want to use a module that isn't in the current path, is there a Raku command that lets me do so, or do I need to exit the REPL and restart it with the correct `-I` argument?

[15:46] <codesections> Second, what does the `-o` flag do when invoking raku?  The help output states "  -o, --output=name    specify name of output file".  I thought that might be an output file for stdout, but `say` still prints to normal stdout.  Or I thought it might be an output file for generated bytecode, but it doesn't seem to be (or, at least, I can't find the output if it is)

[15:49] <codesections> (in an effort to avoid an XY problem, the reason I was looking into the `-o` flag in the first place is that I was curious whether there's a way to output precompiled bytecode for a Raku script.  Raku is *so nice* for writing bash-like utility scripts except for the startup time, so I've been looking into configuration options that might speed that up)

[15:49] <codesections> I know startup time is improving/will improve, but I'm looking at interim measures :)

[15:51] <timotimo> ohai codesections 

[15:51] <codesections> hi :)

[15:51] <timotimo> you can change the search path at any time with a "use lib '/foo/bar'" statement

[15:52] <timotimo> -o is indeed for compiler's stages rather than for programs you run, and it's actually used to generate bytecode for big modules; the core setting is pre-compiled this way

[15:53] <timotimo> the easiest way to get a "program" or "script" precompiled for faster startup is to move all of its functionality into a module and just "use TheModule" as the only thing in the script

[15:53] <timotimo> or like rakudo -MTheModule -e ''

[15:54] <timotimo> what's your startup time like at the moment?

[15:55] *** flossy_ joined
[15:55] <codesections> I have a really detailed answer to that :D

[16:11] <timotimo> yeah that about matches what i get

[16:12] <timotimo> the work jonathan is doing at the moment (the RakuAST thing) sounds like it can enable a decent start-up time decrease

[16:21] <sena_kun> timotimo, how so? Isn't it adding up a layer for `parse -> RakuAST -> QAST -> bytecode`?

[16:22] <codesections> if it does, that would be pretty great.  I'm just starting to dip my toes into the Raku ecosystem, but it sure seems like Johathan is everywhere â€“ that RakuAST, MoarVM, cro, Comma

[16:23] <codesections> I can't tell how much of that is because Raku really *is* as productive as y'all say, and how much he's just really impressive :D  But I'm hoping it's at least a bit of both!

[16:24] <sena_kun> codesections, to be precise, cro does not demand tremendous amounts of time these days and every release of Comma these days is mostly done by me, so jnthn can take the more interesting bits. :P

[16:24] *** wamba joined
[16:24] <codesections> Oh, thanks for the clarification! 

[16:25] <codesections> I hope it didn't sound like I was minimizing your contribution (or anyone else's, for that matter).  Like I said, I'm very new

[16:27] <sena_kun> No problem. I mean, there are _indeed_ a lot of things on jnthn's shoulders, hard to say otherwise. But it is not a "almost one contributor project", there are people around, so it isn't "too" cruel.

[16:29] <codesections> That makes sense, thanks for the clarification.  (I like the implication that it's not too cruel â€“ just cruel enough!)

[16:36] <codesections> re: "adding up a layer for `parse -> RakuAST -> QAST -> bytecode`", things like that *can* speed things up.  I mostly program in Rust, and they had a similar addition: they previously went from src->HIR->LLVM IR->machine code, and changed to src->HIR->MIR->LLVM IR->machine code.  And that resulted in a significant speedup

[16:37] <codesections> (even though it added a step, it saved enough work at the LLVM level to *much* more than pay for itself

[16:37] <codesections> )

[16:37] <sena_kun> May be, would be rather cool if so. :)

[17:45] <skaji_> Hi,

[17:45] <skaji_> I tried making setup-raku-action for GitHub Actions: https://github.com/skaji/setup-raku

[17:45] <skaji_> It seems it works fine. https://github.com/skaji/raku-Acme-Test-Module/actions/runs/158432076

[17:46] <skaji_> I think I could transfer the repository to https://github.com/Raku, and we could maintain it as Raku community.

[17:46] <skaji_> Any thoughts?

[17:52] <lizmat> skaji_: excellent idea... please go ahead :-)

[18:14] <SmokeMachine> skaji_: what about a mi6 release GitHub action?

[18:16] <codesections> By the way, it looks like precompiling a "hello world" script as a module and en 

[18:17] <codesections> *invoking it with -e '' (as discussed above) doesn't make the startup faster â€“ though I bet it would for less trivial scripts

[18:32] <timotimo> it should make a bigger difference if the module has more code in it

[18:32] <codesections> Yeah, I figured as much :) Just adding to my chart for best-case/hello world times

[18:33] <skaji_> lizmat: Thanks! Done. https://github.com/Raku/setup-raku

[18:36] <skaji_> I would like to publish setup-raku to https://github.com/marketplace.

[18:36] <skaji_> For this, it seems that Raku org admins must accept the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement.

[18:37] <skaji_> lizmat: Could you do that?

[18:39] <skaji_> SmokeMachine: It's not difficult to create mi6 release GitHub actions.

[18:39] <skaji_> I personally hesitate to store PAUSE password in GitHub Actions, though:)

[18:39] <SmokeMachine> even with GH secrets?

[18:40] <skaji_> Personally, yes.

[18:48] <skaji_> A PAUSE account usually correspond to a real person, not to some organization.

[18:55] <codesections> The docs list several "module builder and authoring tools", https://docs.raku.org/language/modules-extra, and I don't really understand the difference between them.  skaji, is your App::Mi6 a replacement/alternative to App::Assixt and/or Module::Skeleton?  Or do the three serve different purposes, so that I'd use more than one at a time? 

[18:56] *** flossy left
[18:57] *** flossy joined
[18:59] *** sftp joined
[19:12] *** rbt left
[19:12] <skaji_> As it says, Module::Skeleton only generates a skeleton module.

[19:12] <skaji_> App::Assixt may have some useful features that mi6 does not have.

[19:12] *** rbt joined
[19:14] <skaji_> I make mi6 intentionally simple and "self-assertive".

[19:15] <codesections> Thanks!  So, if I'm understanding correctly, App::Assixt and mi6 are alternatives (that is, I should use one or the other, but probably not both)?

[19:15] <codesections> And mi6 exists to be a simpler/more minimal alternative?

[19:18] <skaji_> Right, it does not make sense to use 2 authoring tools to the same 1 repository.

[19:18] <codesections> Thanks, makes sense!  And, in this context, I read "self-assertive" to mean something like "declarative" â€“ that is, based on a config file that describes what you want, rather than a more procedural description of how to do it?

[19:19] <codesections> (Is that right?  I haven't come across the term "self-assertive" in this context before)

[19:20] *** nightfrog left
[19:20] *** nightfrog joined
[19:22] <skaji_> By "self-assertive", I mean:

[19:23] <skaji_> "mi6 build" always regenerates META6.json and README.md. "mi6 release" always checks you have Changes entries, and creates git commit and tag.

[19:24] <codesections> aha, I get it â€“ "assertive" in the sense of test "assertions"

[19:24] <codesections> thanks for clearing that up

[19:24] <codesections> Sounds like just the right tool for me, then :D

[19:27] <codesections> One other quick question about mi6 while you're here: I notice that `mi6 new` creates a `.pm6` file with `use v6.c`.  Is there a particular reason to use 6.c instead of 6.d?

[19:31] *** molaf left
[19:31] *** stoned75 left
[19:32] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[19:32] <skaji_> actually i'm thinking about removing "use v6" things

[19:33] <skaji_> https://github.com/skaji/mi6/pull/93

[19:34] <codesections> Thanks again :D

[19:44] <SmokeMachine> I'm starting to explain the Red's architecture on documentation (still att the beginning) could some one take a look and give me some opinions/suggestions/ help on how it's going? https://fco.github.io/Red/tutorials/architecture

[19:56] <codesections> I might not be the right audience for this â€“ I'm very new to Raku and don't do a ton of work with ORMs in my main language.  But I took a look at the page you linked and am happy help if I can

[19:58] <codesections> I thought that page was very clear and gave a nice overview :)

[19:59] <codesections> I have a few suggestions for the 2nd paragraph â€“ mostly just tweaking the wording slightly to break up the concepts a bit.  Would you like me to paste my suggestion in?

[20:01] <MasterDuke> SmokeMachine: https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/432 has some minor edits

[20:03] <codesections> Oh, that's obviously a better approach than pasting suggestions in IRC.  I'll also open a PR

[20:52] <rypervenche> Is it safe to say that when using .kv on a hash, there would be no need to use a .map on it since the .kv already kind of does that?

[20:54] *** PotatoGim joined
[20:55] <timotimo> i wouldn't say so?

[20:57] <timotimo> i mean you'd put whatever code you like in the map, kv just gives you keys and values rather than pair objects which is the default listification of hashes

[23:21] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> has the file extension been officially changed to .rakumod yet?

[23:22] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> it seems my install (Rakudo version 2020.06-7-gf1960baa9 built on MoarVM version 2020.06-6-gbf6af07de) isn't recognizing some files unless they have .pm6

[23:22] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> despite my META6.json reporting otherwise

[23:23] <Xliff> DataKinds: To my knowledge, .rakumod should work, but I don't know if all of the authoring tools have been updated to use it, yet.

[23:36] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> that's so bizarre Xliff, because I have a cro project here and a Routes.rakumod

[23:37] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> if I write it as Routes.rakumod (with the same in my META6), I get a Could not find Routes error

[23:37] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> whereas if I rename it Routes.pm6 and change the META6 accordingly, it works fine

[23:40] <AlexDaniel> somebody please tell them? :) https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/hlqmx5/fear_the_loop_loops/fx0zbyf/
