[18:03] * chloekek feels like writing a cobol compiler

[18:03] *** aborazmeh left
[18:08] *** tejr left
[18:08] *** tejr joined
[18:09] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: what about writing a raku compiler x)

[18:10] <chloekek> Where‚Äôs the fun in that?

[18:12] <El_Che>  chloekek: if you have the itch, go for it

[18:12] <El_Che> however I wonder who the audience would be

[18:13] <guifa2> I was thinking about that too for cobol.  It's a language from the 50s, it can't be that hard too parse

[18:13] <guifa2> El_Che: did you not see the news articles about the need for cobol programmers / maintainers?  At least, it's been an issue here in the US

[18:13] <El_Che> Haven't seen to much FOSS in Cobol and the Cobol people I know work in places where the market is cornered by Microfocus and the like

[18:14] <El_Che> guifa2: programmers not compilers

[18:14] <guifa2> El_Che: fair, but it would be cool to be able to use it as a slang in Raku

[18:14] <El_Che> could, sure

[18:15] <El_Che> useful, I have my doubts because a lot of Cobol is run om emulated OSes mimicking Mainframes

[18:15] <El_Che> I don't see Raku running there

[18:15] <El_Che> (to say nothing about the real mainframes)

[18:16] <El_Che> (I did a migration from stratus mainframe/cobol to Solaris Cobol+Java)

[18:16] <chloekek> guifa2: Parsing is not difficult, implementing the plethora of commands and how they work with data is less trivial.

[18:18] <El_Che> what I remember is that the build process was painfully delicate

[18:18] <guifa2> chloekek: taht's what I imagined.  Especially since there were major language revisions changing at times core datatypes

[19:15] <chloekek> There‚Äôs a nice way to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù when writing such a compiler though, which is to implement high-level routines for all the combinations of operations and data types in C, and then just let LLVM inline them. It‚Äôs easier to write C than it is to write code that generates LLVM IR. :)

[20:14] <guifa2> Can you define a variable by a string?  I know you can do ::($foo) to reference a variable but my ::($foo) doesn't work

[20:16] <timotimo> lexical pads aren't run-time mutable

[20:16] <timotimo> packages could do it

[20:16] <timotimo> but of course that's not "my", that's "our"

[20:17] <MasterDuke> istr in the past couple months someone had the same question and there was a bit of back and forth on how it might be possible. maybe something like adding to MY::?

[20:17] <MasterDuke> could try searching the logs

[20:18] <guifa2> Hmm.  It's looking like I'm going to have to do a rewrite eventually then of Binex to compile into QAST 

[20:19] <guifa2> Because otherwise I'm not really sure how I can handle variable definitions and code blocks referencing outside variables =\

[20:20] <guifa2> Or is there a way to run a block unencapsulated?  (e.g. fully inlining its code?) 

[20:22] <guifa2> (even EVAL runs encapsulated boo)

[20:23] <timotimo> there's the whole stuff with whatevercode and such

[20:24] <timotimo> they don't have their own scope

[20:25] *** pilne joined
[20:25] <guifa2> hmm.  I think it might be easier right now for me to just say "youhave to use dynamical variables".  No rush atm for accessing those I don't think
