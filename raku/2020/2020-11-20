[01:15] <Kil93ac> Does anyone know who came up with the whole "LTA" concept?

[01:30] <Kil93ac> If someone finds out,  would be nice to include in Glossary: https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/glossary.pod6#L533    We're implementing the same concept at work and everyone loves it. Would be nice to know who came up with the idea (feels like Audrey's or Larry's doing, but don't know)

[01:30] *** Kil93ac left
[01:36] <perryprog> Huh, that's kinda funny: "LTA" in the context of Wikipedia stands for Long Term Abuse(r). I might have to steal Less Than Awesome as a less-aggressive expansion.

[17:19] <jmerelo> warning everyone who's committed to an Advent article to have it ready soonish

[17:19] <jmerelo> I need some time to edit them, and also want to schedule them in advance. As well as knowing how many are going to be there.

[17:19] <timotimo> jmerelo: it sounds a little strange to say that gitlab "conceded" resources to us

[17:20] <timotimo> that kind of sounds like we had to sue them first or something

[17:20] <jmerelo> timotimo: granted? 

[17:20] <timotimo> provided?

[17:20] <timotimo> offered, maybe?

[17:20] <jmerelo> not really, I had to request it

[17:20] <[Coke]> all 3 of the alts seem fine

[17:21] <[Coke]> so granted/provided

[17:23] <jmerelo> Clarified in Twitter.

[17:23] <jmerelo> English is still not my mother tongue. And there's been too much talk about concession lately, which kind of means a different thing in Spanish. Sorry.

[17:23] <[Coke]> no worries on this end.

[17:24] <timotimo> the smother tongue

[17:24] <jmerelo> Back to the advent thing. Submit your articles, please.

[18:35] <patrickb> jmerelo: Just an idea: Could we spread the advent articles evenly across the days of advent and if more voluneers show up fill in more gaps? That would prevent missing articles at the end in the worst case and reduce stress a little. (With the disadvantage of having fewer articles because we don't need to push people as hard.)

[18:35] <tellable6> 2020-11-19T11:21:05Z #raku-dev <Xliff> patrickb: Unfortunately, I haven't seen much improvement. Using zef 0.9.4

[18:36] <jmerelo> patrickb: there're no allotted days now, actually. I've done it that way precisely to prevent the constant reshuffling I had to do previously

[18:37] *** aluaces joined
[18:37] <jmerelo> at the end of the day, it's just better to set firm deadlines. And we still have 10 slots to fill.

[18:38] <patrickb> jmerelo: Ah! So you already do it that way! (And still push people so we don't end up with very few articles.) jmerelo++

[18:38] <jmerelo> So it's going to be first come, first served. And I'll have a few days of margin to know if more articles are needed. Previously, sometimes in the evening I didn't know if I had an article, and there were no article left to fill

[18:39] <jmerelo> patrickb: basic idea is that previously the deadline was thought to be roughly the day it was assigned. I'm trying to be very clear now that the deadline is Dec 1st for _all_ articles.

[18:39] <patrickb> jmerelo: I like that.

[18:45] <jmerelo> patrickb: as in "I like it so I'll write an article"? :-)
