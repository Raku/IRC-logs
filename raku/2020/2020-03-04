[12:44] <foo222> moritz: thx. I'm using that right now but it's from early 2018. and tio's not responding (and is from 2018 too)

[12:44] *** grondilu joined
[12:44] <foo222> tadzik: the welcome message says to use camelia

[12:48] *** camelia left

[12:48] <tadzik> to me it said: evalable6 | Sorry, it is too private here. You can join #whateverable channel instead

[12:48] <moritz> ... but not responding, wtf?

[12:49] <foo222> tadzik: yes, i omitted the You can join because... I can't. :)

[12:49] <tadzik> now no bot is responding :|

[12:49] <tadzik> foo222: indeed, it's trickier than it looks :) Thanks for pointing it out!

[12:49] <moritz> it might need a while the first time, due to some weird rate limiting rules

[12:50] <moritz> foo222: you can now /msg camelia m: say 'yay'

[12:50] <grondilu> I've updated my Chess module on github (including the version number in META6.json), but "zef update && zef upgrade" doesn't seem to see it.   What am I doing wrong?

[12:50] <moritz> grondilu: is it a CPAN module?

[12:50] <grondilu> I doubt it

[12:50] <tadzik> moritz: ah, so that's what it is!

[12:50] <foo222> moritz: yeah, i've now gotten two camelia m:'s to work. thank you!

[12:50] <tadzik> I always wondered why BasicBot is always slow on the first command

[12:51] <grondilu> CPAN includes Perl 6 modules now?

[12:51] * grondilu thought it was just for Perl 5

[12:51] <moritz> tadzik: basically it rate-limits itself on all the /join commands an all the other meta data it exchanges with each server
