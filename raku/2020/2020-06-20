[16:36] <[Coke]> JJMerelo: getting several aspell test failures right now, all due to Pod::Cache. will look into ripping that out and replacing with the ecosystem version.

[16:36] <[Coke]> ... I know it won't necessarily fix it, but as long as I'm stuck anywya...

[16:36] <JJMerelo> [Coke] not plug-in compatible, I'm afraid...

[16:36] <JJMerelo> You mean Pod::To::Cached, right?

[16:37] <JJMerelo> And Pod::To::Cached is about to be replaced too, anyway...

[16:38] <[Coke]> does the final replacement have a repo yet? Can do the work in a branch.

[16:39] <JJMerelo> [Coke] https://github.com/JJ/raku-cache-pod It's very much a work in (not-a-lot-of) progress

[16:39] <sena_kun> [Coke], I would suggest to just skip the second example, because in some cases it will give you a segv for real.

[16:40] <[Coke]> sena_kun: ?

[16:41] <[Coke]> we're not running the code, we're basically doing "-c" on it.

[16:42] <[Coke]> JJMerelo: so, I'm stuck, then? ok. I'll leave that alone for now. :(

[16:42] <sena_kun> Oh, you're right.

[16:42] <sena_kun> [Coke], sorry for the noise, it was so long ago I worked on this.

[16:43] <[Coke]> does raku have anything like https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Flock in the ecosystem?

[16:43] <JJMerelo> [Coke] we will welcome any help... Also Richard Hainsworth is giving it a go...

[16:43] <[Coke]> sena_kun: no worries!

[16:44] <JJMerelo> [Coke] I think it's part of the butterfly project, at least the underlying system support?

[16:44] <[Coke]> JJMerelo: Don't want to get sucked into the twisty path of reimplementing, sorry.

[16:45] <JJMerelo> [Coke] yeah, I can empatize with that. Or equivelent and right spelling of the word.

[16:45] <JJMerelo> s/equivelent/equivalent/

[16:45] <[Coke]> butterfly project: url? (don't see flock in the module list)

[16:46] <[Coke]> if it's lizmat's work, I'd expect that one to be in the modules list.

[17:10] <JJMerelo> Altai-man_ need any help there?

[17:11] <Altai-man_> True enough. I am still bothered we sacrificed a bit of backward compatibility.

[17:11] <JJMerelo> Just the tiniest bit

[17:12] <Altai-man_> JJMerelo, not with the release. I will need you guidance on docs later, I guess, because I have some long term plans related, but it is too early to tell about it.

[17:29] <lizmat> [Coke] JJMerelo in light of events in the past year, *I* am not going to do any work on making it easier for Perl code to be ported to Raku

[17:29] <lizmat> but I will support anyone willing to put the effort into it

[17:29] <JJMerelo> lizmat makes sense

[18:46] <rir> I was just looking on Raku.org  regarding subsets.  That got me to this question:  What is `::`?  I could not find a definition.

[18:49] <lizmat> that depends on the context

[18:49] <lizmat> like Perl, it's the package separator:  Foo::Bar

[18:50] <lizmat> perhaps https://docs.raku.org/language/packages contains the info you're looking for ?

[19:06] <leont> You mean like «subset :: of Str where 1»?

[19:19] <rir> leont,  yes.  I was trying to use a <<subset Positive of Int where * > -1>> to define a PosInt class.   When a constraint is added, a class that knows its name seems correct.

[19:23] *** retropikzel_ left
[19:23] <guifa> is there a major performance hit for using name aliases in signatures or is most of that handled by the compiler?

[19:24] <[Coke]> for nativecall, do we have an easy way to get at constants set in C?

[19:24] <[Coke]> ISTR this requires reading the C source and cut and paste at the low-tech end (and a script to do it for you elsewhere)

[19:26] <[Coke]> ah, man page works, for this one at least.

[19:26] <MasterDuke> guifa: i believe there's some performance hit, but i don't think it's too big

[19:27] <guifa> okay.  Mainly I’m wondering about the issue of having verbose vs compact options

[19:27] <guifa> e.g.

[19:27] <guifa> format-number :length<long> but also allowing :len<long>

[19:28] * guifa wishes he could also do :l but…. language and length both start with L haha boo English

[19:28] <guifa> also MasterDuke: if you’re around next week think you could look over my slides for me for my talk?  There’s one in particularl that I’m hoping will make you laugh out loud a bit :-)
