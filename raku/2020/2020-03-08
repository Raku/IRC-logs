[13:51] <uzl[m]> In Scheme, you can make a distinction between simple data types (booleans, numbers, etc.) and compound data types (vectors, lists, etc.). Does such a distinction make sense in Raku?

[13:53] *** sena_kun left
[13:56] <moritz> you can make such distinctions

[13:56] <moritz> does it make sense? depends on what you want to do with it

[14:01] *** molaf joined
[14:05] *** m_athias joined
[14:05] <uzl[m]> I guess I meant it from a conceptual (and/or possible pedagogical) viewpoint: You've these simple and indivisible data types on one hand and these other compound data types created by combining other data types on the other.

[14:16] <moritz> yes, that kinda makes sense

[14:27] <Altai-man_> uzl[m], imo, this distinction is bad (from pedagogical point of view), because 1)everything is object; 2)it is is not an object, thus native, it is a bit more advanced for total novices to think about.

[14:28] <Altai-man_> I mean, you can say that List is complex and Int is simple, but it'd be classification for classification which kind of hides the idea they are the same kind of thing

[14:30] <Altai-man_> in lisps, as far as I know, some things are atoms (evaluated to themselves), but in raku you can do `1 but False` and boom.

[15:25] <rypervenche> Can I use an object as a Type constraint in my subroutine? If so, how do I use it?

[15:26] <rypervenche> err, class rather, not object. I'm still very new to OOP.

[15:26] <leont> Not sure I get the question

[15:27] <rypervenche> I'm changing an array of hashes to an array of objects in a script. I'd like to make sure that the return type in a function is a specific object. My wording my be wrong.

[15:27] <lucasb> sub foo(SomeType $obj) {...}  # like this?

[15:27] <Altai-man_> m: class A {}; sub (A $foo) { say $foo }; 

[15:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´WARNINGS for <tmp>:‚ê§Useless use of anonymous sub, did you forget to provide a name? (line 1)‚ê§¬ª

[15:27] <Altai-man_> m: class A {}; sub a(A $foo) { say $foo }; a(A.new);

[15:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´A.new‚ê§¬ª

[15:28] <lucasb> sub foo(--> SomeType) {...}  # then, like this maybe 

[15:28] <rypervenche> sub dmenu ( Protocol:D @input, Str $prompt ) --> Protocol { }; Something like this.

[15:28] <rypervenche> Protocol is my class.

[15:28] <Altai-man_> you can surely do it

[15:30] <rypervenche> Hmm, maybe I did something wrong then. I'll look into it.

[15:31] <rypervenche> Ahh, my --> wasn't inside the parentheses.

[15:33] *** wamba left
[15:36] <leont> You can also use sub foo() returns Bar {}

[16:44] <leont> They work in any type declaration

[16:44] <leont> Not sure exactly how you mean this

[16:46] <rypervenche> I guess, does it make sense that an object can be defined or undefined?

[16:47] <rypervenche> Or is an object by definition defined?

[16:47] <rypervenche> Or does that nomenclature not even work for objects and classes?

[16:48] *** foo222 left
[16:49] <lizmat> rypervenche: you saw my GPaRW presentation?

[16:50] <rypervenche> lizmat: Yes. That was the one I was referring to :)

[16:50] <lizmat> then you should know that an object is an instantiation of a class, and a class is a type ?

[16:52] <rypervenche> I understand that. I just didn't know if :D and :U could fit into the equation anywhere, for example when specifying return types.

[16:52] <Xliff> m: my $a = 0; my @a = ( ($a += 2), 1 ); @a.say;

[16:52] <leont> It can make sense to use them there, yes

[16:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8c995febd: OUTPUT: ¬´[2 1]‚ê§¬ª

[16:53] <lizmat> ok, :U is for types, :D is for objects, :_ is don't care

[16:53] <rypervenche> Ahhhh

[16:53] <lizmat> originally from "Undefined" and "Defined"

[16:53] <rypervenche> THat makes perfect sense then.
