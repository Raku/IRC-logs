[15:34] *** jeff76 joined
[15:37] <jeff76> I think I have found a bug in one of the solutions in Think Perl 6 by Laurent Rosenfeld

[15:38] *** pecastro left
[15:38] <lizmat> could you gist it 

[15:38] <lizmat> ?

[15:41] <jeff76> it's a semantic bug in the solution for the last problem that is not an exercise in chapter 7. the is-reverse function prints false when it should print true and if you change the substring functions last object to 0 it prints true when it should print false 

[15:45] <jeff76> it's in 7.10

[15:46] <lizmat> I don't have the book on my desk...  could you gist a golf of the issue ?

[15:47] <timotimo> my copy is still in a box somewhere

[15:47] <jeff76> I'm using the online version http://greenteapress.com/thinkperl6/thinkperl6.pdf

[15:48] *** xinming left
[15:48] <jeff76> the solution (that is supposed to be bug-free) is in A.5.6

[15:49] *** xinming joined
[15:57] <[Coke]> jeff76: looks like it's checking if word1 is a palindrome, not if word1 eq word2.flip

[15:57] <[Coke]> good catch, I'd report it out to the author.

[15:58] <[Coke]> (note to self, if I ever write a book, make sure I test the samples by running them.)

[15:59] *** lizmat left
[16:04] <rypervenche> So Think Raku is different there.

[16:06] <rypervenche> Version 0.6.0, I think it is. So I think that already got fixed.

[16:07] <rypervenche> jeff76: Check this one out: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentRosenfeld/think_raku/master/PDF/think_raku.pdf
