[11:53] <Zero_Dogg> Is there any raku equivalent of 'perl -i' (ie. to replace 'perl -pi -E' with 'raku -pe') ?

[11:56] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: was that you who asked me about has-one relationships on Red recently? I've just opened this issue, I'd like to know your (and anyone's) opinion about that, please: https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/452

[11:57] <tobs> Zero_Dogg: no, I believe you have to do that by yourself. The <> magic exists in a reduced form in the &lines sub, so you could think about wrapping around that.

[11:58] <Zero_Dogg> tobs: nod, probably not worth it, perl -pi -E is for quick hacks, or as a super-powered sed, if I have to add boilerplate to it then it's most likely overkill
