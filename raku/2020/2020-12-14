[13:56] <tbrowder> hi, question for an RSC member: what is your feeling about publishing a module before it is usable? i have a couple of modules that are WIPs and one uses the other. as long as the synopsis gives the status, and the version is less than 1, is that ok or would that be cpan/ecosystem abuse?

[14:08] <masak> tbrowder: don't take what I say as normative, but... I think there are no restrictions either way. if you feel something might be of more use published, then maybe that's so

[14:09] <masak> tbrowder: if you ask me, most software is in a state of "not done yet"

[14:09] <gfldex> tbrowder: The earlier you publish the faster you get bug reports. It can be quite hard to fix unknown bugs. :)

[17:08] <jmerelo> tony-o: but as a matter of fact, we don't dive deep into whatever tests the author actually makes. And we don't have a test coverage tool to check that kind of thing.

[17:09] <jmerelo> tony-o: as a matter of fact, you can publish things in CPAN without even passing a test. It's been known to happen... At least it undergoes some kind of checks if it's uploaded to the ecosystem

[17:09] <jmerelo> tony-o: I really liked your grant proposal, there are many things in the ecosystem that need an overhaul.

[17:09] <jmerelo> We _do_ need a test coverage tool.
