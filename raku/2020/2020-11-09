[12:05] <xheimlich> so in Python every object has a (up to pseudo-one-way function collisions, I presume) function called "hash".

[12:05] <xheimlich> most, maybe all objects are hashable. I use this to generate unique filenames for serialized objects.

[12:06] <xheimlich> in Raku hash is the name for a dict (or hashmao, sure). What is Python's "hash"?

[12:06] <xheimlich> (I use cksum in bash, but I'm not sure that's the same.)

[12:06] <MasterDuke> .WHICH maybe

[12:08] <xheimlich> p6: say <1 2 3 4>.WHICH; say "Something else".WHICH;

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «List|54965328␤Str|Something else␤»

[12:08] <xheimlich> huh. so It's like an internal identifier? But will it remain the same in a different session/run,or is it like "what's its name in the current session?"

[12:10] <MasterDuke> p6: say <1 2 3 4>.WHICH; say "Something else".WHICH;

[12:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «List|62519168␤Str|Something else␤»

[12:11] *** wamba left
[12:12] <xheimlich> yeah, what I'm looking for is pretty much a checksum. I don't expect it to be compatible with other systems, just that it always gives the same number to the same object and that with some probability same number => same oject.

[12:12] *** wamba joined
[12:13] <xheimlich> in my local machine with Rakudo version 2020.01 implementing Perl 6.d, > say "Something else".WHICH;

[12:13] <xheimlich> Str|Something else

[12:13] <MasterDuke> hm, not sure rakudo has something exactly like that

[12:14] <xheimlich> I have workflows that download images from bing, google etc. image searches.

[12:15] <xheimlich> This is done in Python, so I save them has f"{hash(file_contents)}.{original ext}".  In this way I avoid most duplicates.

[12:16] <xheimlich> then I have some bash lollapalooza to move and copy these files to and from hierachical directory structures, a mess. 

[12:16] <MasterDuke> ah, i don't think rakudo has a built-in hashing function. if you use nqp there's nqp::sha1, but it's probably better to just use a module

[12:16] <xheimlich> So I started to rewrite my bash scripts in Raku and it seemed that downloading the files in Raku was neater. Separate the data wrangling and the machine learning (has to be in Python due to Pytorch).

[12:17] <xheimlich> I can be called experienced in ML with Python but I still can't use it for "shell scripting", it's too convoluted. I already know Raku better than Python for that, and this in a week's time.

[12:18] <MasterDuke> https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=hash has a bunch of options

[12:18] <xheimlich> ok. Iḿ going to do my homework then.

[12:23] <xheimlich> oh wait. there's MD5. That's a little more secure than needed, but file renaming performance shouldn't be a bottleneck.

[13:52] <perryprog> who needs MD5 when you have strlen

[13:58] <tadzik> not PHP :P

[14:01] <perryprog> Sorry sorry, I meant .chars

[14:10] <Altreus> I'm sorry that you recognised it as a PHP function

[14:10] <Altreus> nobody should have to be in that position

[14:13] <tadzik> nah, I was refering to that story where Rasmus allegedly picked different naming conventions for PHP stdlib functions because he was hashing them with strlen and didn't want too many conflicts
