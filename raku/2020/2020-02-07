[06:30] <atweiden-air> i'm liking for aesthetic purposes pathwise for raku libs going forward lib/path/to/module.raku

[06:30] <tellable6> 2020-02-03T19:22:34Z #raku <MasterDuke> atweiden-air: your example works for me in linux. don't know what's up

[06:30] <tellable6> 2020-02-03T19:25:48Z #raku <lizmat> atweiden-air why removing the --has-libtommath ?

[06:30] <atweiden-air> i.e. how elixir does it

[06:30] <atweiden-air> but this apparently breaks the convention of `use Module`. it seems you'd have to do `use module` instead even if the module is named `unit class Module` for example?

[06:31] <atweiden-air> lizmat: because system libtommath and libtommath shipped with 2020.01 differ

[15:32] <rypervenche> What's the best way to sum up the first field from each line in a file?

[15:32] <[Coke]> What's the field separator?

[15:32] <Ven_de_Thiel> `[+] 'a'.IO.lines.map(*.split(',')[0])`?

[15:33] <[Coke]> If it's a .csv, for example, you're going to want a modddddddule

[15:33] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> rypervenche: perhaps slurp($my-file-name).comb(/^^\d+/).sum

[15:33] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> that work?

[15:33] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> comb is quite OP

[15:33] <rypervenche> The FS is a space.

[17:32] <rypervenche> If I have a grammar and I'm using it to look through each line of a file, if a line doesn't match what's in TOP, it will simply get ignored, right? So I can write my grammar's TOP to only look like the lines that I want to find, yes?

[17:32] *** sena_kun left
[17:37] <AlexDaniel> rypervenche: yes, if you want to match each line separately (instead of using your grammar to parse the whole file)

[17:39] <rypervenche> AlexDaniel: Ahh, I suppose the difference would be how the TOP ends? Like with a % \n or something?

[17:40] *** wildtrees joined
[17:40] <AlexDaniel> rypervenche: yeah, something like <your-line-rule>+ % \n

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> or even %%

[17:41] <rypervenche> Gotcha. Good to know. I'll be sure to do that instead of using .lines to loop through each line. Seems very unnecessary.

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> well, it depends

[17:41] <rypervenche> Yes. I ran into an issue where my file tacked on an extra \n at the end of the file. %% \n helped.

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> if your file is large then parsing it line by line is a better idea (you won't end up getting your whole parse tree in RAM)

[17:42] <rypervenche> Ahh.

[19:05] <bdju> I noticed on the "whatever" section of the website that the vim/neovim plugin links are different, however the neovim one links to the old archived plugin and redirects you to the one that the vim link already pointed to.
