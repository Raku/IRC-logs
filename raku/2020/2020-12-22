[00:03] <melezhik> I finally added markdown to html parser to https://sparrowhub.io

[00:04] <melezhik> it took me awhile to figure out how to do it properly

[00:04] *** vrurg left
[00:04] <melezhik> I even managed to add syntax highlighter, unfortunately it  does not support Raku 

[00:10] <moon-child> what are you using for syntax highlighting?

[00:11] <melezhik> https://highlightjs.org/

[00:11] *** vrurg joined
[00:13] <moon-child> I think the biggest generic syntax highlighting framework is pygments, and it has support for raku

[00:15] <melezhik> yeah.  the thing is I need support on js side

[00:20] <moon-child> oh, syntax highlighting happens on frontend?

[00:20] <melezhik> yeah

[00:20] <moon-child> why not put it on backend? :P

[00:22] <melezhik> it's just was easier for me, but you're welcome to contribute )))

[00:22] <melezhik> if it'll solve the problem ...

[00:23] <melezhik> meanwhile I will try mu luck on this side - https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/2933

[09:25] <Ovidius> Just installed rakudobrew and ran "rakudobrew download" and get the following error: Couldn't find a precomp release for OS: "macos", architecture: "x86_64"

[09:25] <Ovidius> Where's the best place to ask for help on that error?

[09:27] <El_Che> here probably, the authors of rakudobrew will probably pop up and there are probably rekudobrew mac users (lizmat?)

[09:28] <Ovidius> This is the open source equivalent of "Please hold while we connect you with an available support person" :)

[09:28] <El_Che> Ovidius: pretty much :)

[09:29] <CIAvash> I think you are supposed to use rakubrew now, if I'm not mistaken https://rakubrew.org/

[09:29] <Ovidius> CIAvash: that just gives me a "Usage" message.

[09:33] <CIAvash> hmm

[09:35] <tadzik> 3> the authors of rakudobrew will probably pop up

[09:35] <tadzik> well I'm here, but I haven't done anything on it for years :P I dind't know we have precomp releases, for instance :)

[09:37] <Ovidius> Ah well. I'll be patient.

[09:37] <El_Che> Ok, it's starting to look like a Monty Python sketch :)

[09:39] <El_Che> Ovidius as Ovid?

[09:40] <Ovidius> Yes. Ovid is usually taken as a username.

[09:40] <El_Che> I didn't make the link until I saw your tweet :)

[09:40] <Ovidius> Heh :)

[09:40] <Ovidius> I sometimes use Quintilian, a famous Roman orator, but people don't make that link, either.

[09:40] <El_Che> I could just stop my self in time to replying "hey, funny, someone is asking exact the same question on irc right now":)

[09:47] *** sjm_uk left
[09:47] <El_Che> I don't think we read Quintilian in high school, from what I remember we mostly read Ovid, Virgil and Tacitus. 

[09:49] <El_Che> and of course Caesar's "CommentƒÅriƒ´ dƒì Bell≈ç Gallic≈ç" as it talks about "Belgium"

[09:51] <Ovidius> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintilian

[09:59] <El_Che> Ovidius: How is Cor advancing? Do you feel the core people embrace the ideas?

[10:00] <Ovidius> El_Che: We have good work on the spec, though there are going to be some tricky bits when it comes to object construction and roles. I know there's still decent interest, but the governance process has temporarily halted some work while that gets nailed down.

[10:01] <Ovidius> But I've pitched the Cor talk for Fosdem and it will be interesting if non-Perl people see it and talk about it. No more room size restrictions.

[10:01] <Ovidius> (that I'm aware of)

[10:03] <El_Che> It feels like a now-or-never opportunity to me.

[10:03] <Ovidius> Better stated: I think we have the syntax pretty much done for v1 (but no types). Semantics are harder. And yeah, it does feel like now-or-never.

[10:03] <El_Che> however, I feel that Perl 7 will not be out soon

[10:05] <Ovidius> I suspect that's the case, but I don't think it will impact Cor. We'll have something like `use feature 'class';` as a guard.

[10:05] <El_Che> that's the safest bet for now

[10:06] <El_Che> /usr/bin/perl does it not make it easy to switch everything on by default

[10:06] <Ovidius> I would love to see something like a `use latest;` pragma.

[10:07] <Ovidius> No more hard-coding the version number. Dangerous, though :)

[10:08] <El_Che> a bleeding edge "use Modern::Perl"

[10:08] *** sjm_uk joined
[10:09] *** brtastic1 joined
[10:09] <El_Che> I did some light reading of the mailing list and while no asbestos suit was needed, there is not much of a cencensus about 7

[10:11] <Ovidius> Agreed. And given the subtlety of many of the issues, I backed out of that debate.

[10:12] *** brtastic1 is now known as brtastic

[10:18] <Ovidius> When I just type "raku" by itself and get the REPL, it says "You may want to `zef install Readline` or `zef install Linenoise` or use rlwrap for a line editor", but I've already installed both of those. And I can't "arrow up" in the REPL. How do I debug that?

[10:22] <dakkar> Ovidius: I suspect you have 2 raku installations now, and the Readline/Linenoise are installed in the "wrong" one

[10:23] <Ovidius> Bah. That's probably the case. which -a doesn't tell me, but I'll dig around.

[10:23] <dakkar> `zef locate Readline` might help

[10:24] <Ovidius> Well, just found an old `/opt/rakudo-star-2018.04/` directory which I blew away. That blew away my zef. Will try to reinstall. Fun times.

[10:26] <dakkar> feels like the times before `local::lib` ‚ò∫

[10:26] <El_Che> Ovidius: if you use homebre, there is  a raku distribution

[10:27] <El_Che> rakudo I mean

[10:27] <El_Che> ( I prefer it to the star distribution also there)

[10:27] <Ovidius> I'm using that. I just did a reinstall since `rakubrew` isn't working. Still no zef.

[10:28] <El_Che> https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/65995

[10:28] <El_Che> I could swear zef was there before

[10:28] *** skaji_ joined
[10:29] <Ovidius> bah.

[10:29] <El_Che> I cheat and add zef to my compiler raku packages for linux :)

[11:01] <Ovidius> OK, this is kind of funny. I use `brew install rakudo` because rakubrew apparently doesn't work on a Mac. But the brew cask doesn't include zef. But I noticed that rakubrew has a `install-zef` command and that worked just fine. A little tweak of my $PATH variable and I have raku via brew, and zef via rakubrew and they play together just fine.

[19:49] <Xliff> What's the best way to spawn a parallel thread without a sequence, list or array?

[19:49] <Xliff> I do not want (7, 14, 21...Inf).hyper -- this will nom memory really quick!

[19:49] <moritz> async { } ?

[19:50] <Xliff> moritz: That's async, not parallel, though... right?

[19:51] <Xliff> Thread.new?

[19:52] <moritz> Xliff: the scheduler generally takes care of distributing async tasks to different OS threads

[19:53] <Xliff> yah. I've had this fail when using both start {} and hyper()

[19:53] <Xliff> It should have spread to different cores, and didn't.

[19:54] <Xliff> Well.... I'll try going back to start and seeing if this new method works.

[19:54] <Xliff> Thanks.

[21:06] <melezhik> I suggested Sparrow as a one of internal tooling option for RockyLinux (CentOS replacement), not sure if they accept it, but who knows? Anyway another chance for people to know about Raku :-)  - https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/configuration-management-options/64/27?u=melezhik

[21:09] <melezhik> the same idea, another day I was thinking about maybe I could create some tools for Cro and upload them to Sparrowhub? something that Cro users would use on daily basis ... But not sure if there are demands on that ...
