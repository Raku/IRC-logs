[02:29] <pkmnx> how get get bin mode on $*IN ?

[02:29] <pkmnx> I run a .say on for instance /usr/bin/ls ... and I get malformed utf8 error ...

[02:30] <pkmnx> basically - I want to pipe and pass out ...

[02:30] <pkmnx> per shitov, using raku #95 ...

[02:31] <pkmnx> but looks like binary files give error ...

[02:37] *** guifa2 left
[03:15] *** frost-lab joined
[03:20] *** guifa2 joined
[03:21] <guifa2> It should be $*IN.open: :bin, I'd think

[03:21] <guifa2> but haven't used it much

[03:21] *** guifa2 left
[03:21] <pkmnx> let me see ...

[03:33] <pkmnx> there's something fundamental I'm misunderstanding - the say seems to deal w/ strings ... I guess I want $*IN to be smart enough to know if its dealing w/ binary data or string data ...

[03:34] <pkmnx> and i haven't figured out how to write to standard out binary data, as it isn't a string ...

[03:34] <pkmnx> ... but shitov's book should make that clear ...

[08:47] <El_Che> hi, I've afk (demolishing big parts of house to prepare for renovations). I see rakudo 2020.11 is out, but I read in weekly it was slower. Should I release a linux pkg? Remember that users will automatically upgrade (repos)

[08:48] *** leont joined
[08:53] *** xinming left
[08:53] *** xinming joined
[09:10] <Xliff> El_Che: Do you know anything about BOOTInts?

[09:11] <Xliff> I seem to be getting them in my Perl6 code from a BEGIN block, but my understanding is that those are only available when bootstrapping.

[09:12] <timotimo> i think bootints are also what is used in pretty much all nqp code

[09:12] <timotimo> nqp: say(nqp::gethow(1).name(1))

[09:12] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «No registered operation handler for 'gethow'␤   at gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:1504  (/home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/nqp/lib/QAST.moarvm:compile_op)␤ from gen/moar/stage2/QAST.nqp:6174  (/home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/nqp/lib/QAST.moarvm:compile_node)…»

[09:12] <timotimo> nqp: say(1.HOW.name(1))

[09:12] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «BOOTInt␤»

[09:13] <Xliff> Well, how can I use them in Perl6 code?

[09:13] <Xliff> Because assigning them to native ints throws an exception.

[09:17] <timotimo> normally they'd be turned into Int through the hllize operation

[09:17] <Xliff> Yeah. I have objects created in BEGIN block that I use in HLL code. The BOOTInts still exist in the BEGIN-time created objects.

[09:18] <timotimo> sounds kind of like a bug where something is leaking

[09:19] <Xliff> If so, it's been there since 2018.03

[09:19] *** wamba joined
[09:20] <timotimo> do you have the example code perhaps?

[09:20] <Xliff> Yup.

[09:20] <timotimo> if it's not too huge :)

[09:20] <Xliff> You aren't gonna like it though... :)

[09:20] <timotimo> also, i don't actually have time to look at it much

[09:21] <Xliff> GLib COGL and Clutter

[09:21] <Xliff> Do you have those?

[09:30] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[09:34] <Xliff> Actually, those objects are made at INIT time. Weird.

[09:46] *** xinming left
[09:47] *** xinming joined
[09:55] <lizmat> El_Che: good question re upgrading.  I'm not sure what the correct answer is

[09:55] <lizmat> 2020.11 does contain a lot of nice new features

[09:57] <Xliff> lizmat: Are you familiar with BOOTInt? It's getting leaked into some of my Perl6 code.

[09:58] <lizmat> you're still using Perl6 ?

[09:58] <lizmat> :-)

[09:58] <lizmat> yes, I'm familiar with BOOTInt

[09:58] <Xliff> *headdesk*

[09:58] <Xliff> Is there an easy fix?

[09:59] <lizmat> using it as an Int ?

[09:59] <Xliff> Well, I'm trying to assign to uint8, but it fails typecheck.

[10:00] <lizmat> gist ?

[10:01] <Xliff> No gist. It's part of my larger work.

[10:01] <lizmat> can you provide a --ll-exception of the typecheck error ?

[10:01] <Xliff> Sure. One sec.

[10:05] <Xliff> Damn. --ll-exception is not printing the long exception from the callback.

[10:07] <Xliff> OK, think I've got it.

[10:09] <Xliff> lizmat: I am starting a writeup. It will be ready for you in a sec.

[10:12] <Xliff> lizmat: In lieu of a gist, I give you... a longer gist. :)

[10:12] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/3290a3f31a3f7937f22421bb1d4e0480

[10:12] <Xliff> I hope the extra detail helps.

[10:13] <lizmat> this is on HEAD ?

[10:13] <Xliff> Yes

[10:13] <Xliff> This problem goes back to 2018.03

[10:14] <lizmat> so something is feeding a Supply ?  What is that ?

[10:15] <Xliff> lizmat: I don't think the Supply part is the problem.

[10:15] <Xliff> But for background: I've emulated jnthn++'s use of Supplys to run GLib-based events.

[10:15] <Xliff> s/Supplys/Supplies/

[10:16] <Xliff> The draw event is tied to the supply.

[10:16] <Xliff> The error occurs inside the draw event.

[10:16] <Xliff> I think the key line is here: 'in any  at gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6c.nqp line 2628'

[10:16] *** aborazmeh left
[10:17] <lizmat> yeah, that's where the error occurs

[10:17] <lizmat> the problem is that nqp-land ints wind up in Rakudo land

[10:17] <Xliff> Yah. I thought that was it, too.

[10:17] <lizmat> and that's because they are fed into the supply, which passes them on verbatim

[10:18] <lizmat> which BTW I think is a good thing generally

[10:18] <Xliff> Why are they nqp-land? Is that because they were created at INIT?

[10:19] <Xliff> If so, maybe the fix is to hllize at creation?

[10:19] <lizmat> aah... yes

[10:19] <Xliff> :-)

[10:19] <Xliff> How do I do that?

[10:20] <lizmat> nqp::hllize() I guess

[10:21] <Xliff> OK. Next question: How would I test for the need to hllize?

[10:21] <Xliff> Because this is still Raku-level code.

[10:23] <lizmat> I guess inside Clutter::Color.get_static ?

[10:24] <Xliff> Well, that's the plan.

[10:24] <Xliff> Will nqp::hllize do the right thing if I pass it a Raku Int?

[10:25] *** Black_Ribbon left
[10:26] <Xliff> Hrm. nqp::hllize doesn't look to be documented here: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown#-hll-specific-operations

[10:27] <xinming> SmokeMachine: is rs-class<xxx>, How do we create the Rs class?

[10:27] <Xliff> lizmat: Is there somewhere I can look for its usage?

[10:27] <lizmat> hmmm... it's not in https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown either

[10:28] <lizmat> oops, that's the same  :-)

[10:28] <lizmat> not in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown either

[10:28] <SmokeMachine> xinming: class xxx does Red::ResultSeq {}

[10:29] <Xliff> lizmat: Ooh! Useful page! Thanks for the link!

[10:29] <lizmat> m: use nqp; dd nqp::hllize(42)    # looks like

[10:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1801a5aa3: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[10:30] <Xliff> m: use nqp; my $a = -1; dd nqp::hllize(nqp::decont($a))

[10:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1801a5aa3: OUTPUT: «-1␤»

[10:30] <Xliff> m: use nqp; my $a = 99; dd nqp::hllize(nqp::decont($a))

[10:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1801a5aa3: OUTPUT: «99␤»

[10:30] <Xliff> Ah. I think I'm fine if I decont!

[10:31] <Xliff> Forgot about that. Will check this.

[10:41] <Xliff> Let me check

[10:41] <SmokeMachine> xinming: did that work?

[10:41] <lizmat> cause that's a HLL construct?

[10:42] <Xliff> Yep! The decont is required.

[10:43] <lizmat> he, so somehow the NQPland BOOTInt got into a scalar
