[00:28] <timotimo> you could tr timing individual pieces

[00:29] <timotimo> does the output appear in the expected "rhythm" or are there pauses where you wouldn't expect any?

[00:30] <timotimo> like, you would expect creating links and creating sentences grepped to appear immediately, and also creating @sentences would appear immediately

[00:30] <timotimo> but then it'd await the sentence grepping part

[01:18] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> no problem rypervenche!

[01:19] <timotimo> hey @DataKinds, you made that blog post including the "create objects a bunch" benchmark, right?

[01:19] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> timotimo: yeah I did, what's up?

[01:20] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> you mean this one right https://datakinds.github.io/2020/06/17/raku-in-2020

[01:20] <timotimo> we have an optimization that may one day let this run at much much higher speeds

[01:20] <timotimo> because it won't be creating the objects at all

[01:21] <timotimo> and in the past i've been interested in giving raudo an optimization for when you give it an empty program :D

[01:22] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> hehe

[01:22] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> what's the code path look like for an empty file, anyway?

[01:23] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> i was hoping that neither ruby nor raku had an optimization like that because I really wanted to test like the full VM start-up time

[01:23] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> also, more importantly: what do you mean by "it won't be creating the objects at all" timotimo?

[01:24] <timotimo> in the ideal case, the entire stuff that happens inside the for loop is inlined

[01:24] <timotimo> and the optimizer can reason that nothing that was created escapes

[01:24] <timotimo> so no object has to be created, as long as we keep the things around that were put into attributes and such

[01:25] *** molaf joined
[01:26] <timotimo> with a little extra it can see that it's not ever read from

[01:26] <timotimo> so the code inside the loop turns into { }

[01:30] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> ahh that'd be very cool

[01:30] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> would that happen in an optimization pass after the execution begins? or before

[01:31] <timotimo> after

[01:31] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> very cool

[01:31] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> additionally, what's the feasibility of having an optimization for large collections of small objects where instantiating a new one actually just acts as a thin delta layer on top of a pointer to another object? ala some of clojure's collections

[01:31] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> i know there's a LOT of speed to be had there

[01:32] <timotimo> there's at least one talk by jonathan about this, it's "scalar replacement" and "escape analysis" (well, the latter enables the former in this case)

[01:32] *** Cabanossi left
[01:32] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> does raku not currently do any sort of escape analysis?

[01:32] <timotimo> ah, kind of like turning an array of structs into a struct of arrays?

[01:32] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> ya

[01:32] <timotimo> it does, just not all of the escape analysis forever

[01:33] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> ah interesting

[01:33] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> sorry i'm picking your brain here i always found optimization really interesting

[01:33] <timotimo> same

[01:34] <raku-bridge> <DataKinds> does rakudo currently do any sort of small object optimization?

[01:35] <timotimo> i'm not sure if this counts; moarvm has an allocator for pages of almost-same-sized objects

[10:02] <linkable6> R#3765 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3765 [SEGV] Segmentation Fault occurring in 2020.06 after Converting Script to a Module

[10:03] *** MasterDuke joined
[10:05] <nine> Xliff: sorry, not any time soon. I'm in the middle of getting in-process precompilation going. If you could narrow down the failure to a somewhat more manageable size, I may be able to help.

[10:06] <Xliff> nine: OK. Will attempt to work toward that.

[10:06] <Xliff> nine: However, I expect the size is tied to the root cause. :/

[10:07] <MasterDuke> nine: in-process compilation will help a lot with large projects with lots of large dependencies, correct? (e.g., a lot of Xliff's projects)

[10:07] <tellable6> 2020-06-23T09:55:01Z #moarvm <nine> MasterDuke: I think spesh plugins are going to be replaced by the new dispatch architecture. So probably not...

[10:07] <nine> No. I don't think we've ever had a bug that depended on having huge code size

[10:07] <nine> MasterDuke: yes

[10:08] <nine> MasterDuke: I didn't think it would, but apparently it can save a very noticable part of compilation time when code is spread out over lots of compilation units

[10:08] <Xliff> nine: There's always the first time, yes?

[10:08] <MasterDuke> nine: i'm not sure about that (re large code size). very large literals (e.g., a hash with 100k+) have problems

[10:09] <nine> MasterDuke: yes, but that's a much more extreme case than "my script is just pretty long"

[10:09] <MasterDuke> nine: and good point re new-disp, i won't do anything until after that lands

[10:09] <Xliff> nine: No, I think it's more the number of compunits involved, rather than code size. Just a thought.

[10:09] <nine> I'd bet that it's not that either

[10:10] <Xliff> Again, just a thought.

[17:25] <antononcube> Hi! I want some help with choosing package / module name. I wrote Raku packages that translated natural language commands into executable code in different programming languages. Say, I have QuantileRegressionWorflows module and LatentSemanticAnalysis module. What would be good module "path" names? Something like "Text::LatentSemanticAnalysis" or

[17:25] <antononcube> "CodeGeneration::LatentSemanticAnalysis" ?

[17:25] *** dakkar left
[17:26] <timotimo> jdv79: you need the timo fork's "nqp-ops-makes-things-faster" (or similar) branch

[17:26] *** squashable6 joined
[17:27] <Altai-man_> antononcube, `Text::` seems fitting to me.

[17:27] <antononcube> Here is an example call to the module LatentSemanticAnalysis: say to_LSAMon_R(  "create from textHamlet;   make document term matrix with stemming FALSE and automatic stop words;   apply LSI functions global weight function IDF, local term weight function TermFrequency, normalizer function Cosine;   extract 12 topics using method NNMF and max steps

[17:27] <antononcube> 12 and 20 min number of documents per term;   show topics table with 12 terms;   show thesaurus table for king, castle, denmark;")

[17:28] <antononcube> That call generates this R code: LSAMonUnit(textHamlet) %>%LSAMonMakeDocumentTermMatrix( stemWordsQ = FALSE, stopWords = NULL) %>%LSAMonApplyTermWeightFunctions(globalWeightFunction = "IDF", localWeightFunction = "None", normalizerFunction = "Cosine") %>%LSAMonExtractTopics( numberOfTopics = 12, method = "NNMF",  maxSteps = 12,

[17:28] <antononcube> minNumberOfDocumentsPerTerm = 20) %>%LSAMonEchoTopicsTable(numberOfTerms = 12) %>%LSAMonEchoStatisticalThesaurus( words = c("king", "castle", "denmark"))

[17:29] <antononcube> Altai-man_ Thanks! I am strongly considering `"Text::"`. You do not find it too generic?

[17:31] <Altai-man_> antononcube, not really. It depends on the direction you want/can take it to. For example, if you plan to make lots of plugins you can put it under some top-level name, just not too long please. ;) For example, there are Sparrow::{Plugins...} or Cro::(Core, HTTP, etc) and it is not "Web::Cro::...".

[17:32] <Altai-man_> antononcube, if you are going for a single module, then Text seems ok. It assumes working with some text, including parsing/generation as well as modifying, etc.

[17:33] <antononcube> Altai-man_ Good point. I do want to have multiple modules for generating Machine Learning workflows and might reuse grammars from siblings models.

[17:34] <Altai-man_> antononcube, you can also consider just `LSA` prefix, I see google understands this abbr pretty well. Just to save some typing.

[17:35] <antononcube> Altai-man_ So I envision something like `CodeGeneration::LatentSemanticAnalysisWorkflows`, `CodeGeneration::QuantileRegressionWorkflows`, `CodeGeneration::RecommenderWrofkows`, etc.  And, yes, I realize the names I am showing are long.

[17:38] <Altai-man_> antononcube, personally, I don't mind long names, auto-completion saves my day. Though `CodeGeneration` sounds a bit unusual. I wrote Java::Generate, maybe you can go with `LSA::Generate` or something. ;)

[17:39] <antononcube> Altai-man_ I am targeting different programming languages with the same parser/interpreter module.

[17:41] <antononcube> Altai-man_ For example here is a Python code generation result with the same sequence of natural commands above:  `obj = LSAMonUnit(aText );obj = LSAMonMakeDocumentTermMatrix( lsaObj = obj, stemWordsQ = NA);obj = LSAMonEchoDocumentTermMatrixStatistics( lsaObj = obj );obj = LSAMonApplyTermWeightFunctions( lsaObj = obj, globalWeightFunction = "IDF",

[17:41] <antononcube> localWeightFunction = "None", normalizerFunction = "Cosine");obj = LSAMonExtractTopics( lsaObj = obj, numberOfTopics = 12, method = "NNMF",  maxSteps = 12);obj = LSAMonEchoTopicsTable( lsaObj = obj, numberOfTableColumns = 12, numberOfTerms = 10);obj = LSAMonEchoStatisticalThesaurus( lsaObj = obj, words = c("sing", "left", "home"))`

[17:42] <Altai-man_> antononcube, not sure if it implies anything different from what I wrote.

[17:43] <antononcube> Altai-man_ I mean I do not think this would work:`R::LatentSemanticAnalysisWorkflows`,`Python::LatentSemanticAnalysisWorkflows`, `Java::LatentSemanticAnalysisWorkflows` .

[17:44] <Altai-man_> Well, I suggested LSA::Generate, which can have LSA::Generate::R, LSA::Generate::Python, etc.

[17:44] <Altai-man_> LSA::Core etc.

[17:45] <antononcube> Altai-man_ I see. Yes, that is interesting/good way of partitioning the functionalities..

[17:45] <antononcube> @Alta

[17:47] <antononcube> Altai-man_ But the problem with that approach is that if want to have a common module with grammar for generic words or phrases I cannot share between the modules for LSA, Regression, or Classification.

[17:48] <Altai-man_> Why?

[17:49] <antononcube> Altai-man_ Because I do not thing `LSA::Generate::CommonWords` belongs in an obvious way to `QR::Generate::`

[17:50] <Altai-man_> antononcube, use LSA::CommonWords?

[17:52] *** brtastic joined
[17:53] <antononcube> Altai-man_ Sure, I can use it explicitly in `QR::Generate::`,  but I think with `CodeGeneration::CommonWords`, `CodeGeneration::QR::`, `CodeGeneration::LSA::` the dependency is going to be more obvious.

[17:54] <Altai-man_> antononcube, well, you can do as you please, not sure if anybody can stop you.

[17:55] *** Noisytoot_ is now known as Noisytoot

[17:56] <antononcube> Altai-man_ Ok, good to know. :)   But the alternative breakdown you suggested is definitely something I am going to seriously consider.

[18:15] <JJMerelo> I think I know the answer to that, but...

[18:18] <jdv79> hmm, raku segfaults at teh end of the run with --profile=heap

[18:20] <timotimo> oh? it shouldn't have anything much that it runs when the program is finished

[18:35] <jdv79> Corrupted block detected

[18:36] <MasterDuke> i was able to `zef install Compress::Zstd` no trouble. do you have the zstd-dev (or whatever it is for your os) package installed?

[18:36] <jdv79> just installed it - ubuntu latest

[18:36] <jdv79> 20.something

[18:37] <timotimo> ah yes v002 is vastly bigger

[18:37] <timotimo> ah, yes, i've got an off-by-one in there that i've only been able to reproduce in tests - which is ... "ironic"? i think it means the decompress stuff is fine and tfhe compress stuff has a bug

[18:41] <jdv79> is there somethign else i should do?

[18:44] <abraxxa> any idea why copying a file to a gvfs mounted dir doesn't work?

[18:44] <abraxxa> I get an Failed to copy file: operation not supported on socket error

[18:46] <MasterDuke> jdv79: you probably need to recompile moarvm so that it can see you now support zstd

[18:49] <jdv79> i'

[18:49] <jdv79> ll try

[18:51] <MasterDuke> i see `libs:  -lm -lpthread -lrt -ldl -lzstd` in the output after i `perl Configure.pl`

[18:55] <jdv79> i just saw that

[19:10] *** sena_kun joined
[19:12] *** Altai-man_ left
[19:12] <timotimo> if anybody wants to, they could turn libzstd into a run-time dependency rather than a compile-time dependency

[19:13] <jdv79> same error from the profiler after a recompile

[19:13] <timotimo> if that's a thing, that you just put the .h or something derived from it, into your code

[19:13] <jdv79> the Compress:Zstd tests passed this time though 

[19:14] <timotimo> looks like it's still reading a v2 file

[19:15] <timotimo> for v3 it'd be using HeapAnalyzer/Parser.pm6

[19:16] <jdv79> should/can i gen a v3 file?

[19:17] <timotimo> you'll have to until i figure out why the heap snapshot parser isn't working right with v2

[19:18] <jdv79> how do i gen a v3 file?

[19:18] <timotimo> when moar is built while libzstd is found, it'll gen v3

[19:19] <timotimo> there's a flag you can pass to configure if you really want v2 instead

[19:24] <timotimo> there's a pull-request from nwc to fix something related to the v2 format i think?

[20:01] <jdv79> timotimo: even a v3 snap fails on a summayr for me

[20:01] <timotimo> oh? now things are getting more interesting

[20:02] <jdv79> https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1320538

[20:02] *** molaf left
[20:03] <jdv79> at least the initial summary seems to be correct - for this simple run i see ~20M growth 

[20:03] <timotimo> that's a good start

[20:03] <jdv79> but i'm not sure how much more i can glean from that

[20:03] <timotimo> right, you'll want at the very least the highscore list

[20:04] <jdv79> if i know what htat was - i believe you 

[20:04] <jdv79> *knew

[20:04] <timotimo> the error message is potentially from inside moarvm, where it might be interpolating an empty debugname, in which case we may be doing something wrong in there, too

[20:04] <timotimo> probably just a cosmetic fix there, though

[20:06] <jdv79> is there a way to measure how much mem a ref is using?

[20:06] <timotimo> a ref is usually just a pointer inside of an object

[20:06] <jdv79> iirc in perl there's something like Scalar::Size 

[20:06] <jdv79> i mean recursively

[20:06] <jdv79> "this hash is x size"

[20:07] <timotimo> nothing that's really easy just yet

[20:07] <jdv79> i do collect a results array for final processing but it should be tiny unless raku datastructures are way larger than i would think

[20:07] <timotimo> it's moderately interesting that the number of frames is growing

[20:08] <timotimo> we can get a bit of interesting output from log::timeline

[20:08] <timotimo> hold on

[20:09] <timotimo> if you could set LOG_TIMELINE_JSON_LINES=/dev/stderr for example

[20:10] <jdv79> where do i set that?

[20:10] *** kensanata joined
[20:10] *** rbt left
[20:11] *** rbt joined
[20:12] <jdv79> that blasts out a lot of gibberish it looks like 

[20:12] <timotimo> yeah, it's supposed to output a json blob per line

[20:12] <timotimo> ok perhaps mixing it with stdout is a bad idea

[20:13] *** epony joined
[20:14] <timotimo> hm. can i feed comma's log::timeline viewer with jsonp files?

[20:20] <jdv79> https://nopaste.xyz/?d0349318bc0468d6#5nMwBjANsxmBb8wTsi2yyPoWwtyQz8bLMWFarD8ZhUeT

[20:20] <jdv79> idk if that means anything

[20:22] <timotimo> isn't it beautiful how it randomizes the keys of the json dicts there

[20:23] <timotimo> ok, so the kind ("k" field) can be 0 for an event, 1 for "task start" and 2 for "task end", the latter two will also have an "i" which is a unique id

[20:24] <timotimo> oh, when it exits with an exception, we'll also see the "task end" for it

[20:24] <timotimo> so that's not how i could find out where it b0rks

[20:25] <jdv79> hmm

[20:27] <timotimo> i could see it from it being too quick, but does that even make sense ...

[20:39] <timotimo> jdv79:i think a little piece of the err file got killed because of 2>err vs 2>>err ?

[20:39] <timotimo> in that case i shouldn't recommend setting LOG_TIMELINE_JSON_LINES to stdout or stderr

[21:18] <timotimo> sorry i got pulled AFK for a bit there

[21:18] <timotimo> really i'm pretty confused about what the state may be at the point of the exception

[21:18] <timotimo> is your data sufficiently harmless that you can just send the heap snapshot file over to me?

[21:20] <timotimo> maybe we'll put a dd of $values and $result in front of the if $entrysize == [...] in Parser.pm6 around line 218

[21:20] <timotimo> and then dd the $dcvalues and $dcresult inside each of these ifs

[21:21] <timotimo> i have to go prepare some food

[21:24] <jdv79> idk - whta's in the snapshot?

[21:24] <jdv79> as long as it doesn't have data sure

[21:24] <jdv79> how do i send it to you?  its 309M

[21:25] <timotimo> it has filenames, function/method names and their line numbers, it has names of attributes, if you have an array of Int objects, the int cache will probably rat out values between -1 and 16 or 32 or so

[21:26] <timotimo> https://goo.gl/t9VoHG - this may work? snapdrop? it ought to send it p2p

[21:27] <timotimo> feel free to symmetrically encrypt it with gpg with some passphrase you get to me via another channel or whatever

[21:33] <timotimo> this is probably a dumb question; you're on an x86 system? i haven't made the heap snapshot profiler endianness-clean

[21:34] <timotimo> GTG now, sorry

[21:35] <timotimo> this tool requires me to click accept before it will transfer anything i believe

[21:35] <timotimo> maybe try firefox send
