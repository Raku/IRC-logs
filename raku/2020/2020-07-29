[08:35] <zacts> morning

[08:36] <zacts> I want to get involved with raku; don't know exactly where to begin.

[08:38] <sena_kun> zacts, it depends on what you want and can (learn to) work on. For starters, see https://raku.org/community/ <- Getting Involved section where number of activities is described.

[08:41] <zacts> cool. I'm guessing I should start by learning the language a bit first.

[08:41] <sena_kun> Yes. In fact, even trying to setup things can be helpful, as you can report issues, inconveniences and such.

[08:42] <zacts> I'm hoping to find a way to define my own syntax and stuff.

[08:42] <zacts> like, at least from what I gather, it seems that raku has a lot of promise for my goals of a daily language that I work with.

[08:43] <sena_kun> Extending the syntax is surely possible, yes.

[08:43] <zacts> I'm looking for something that I can customize, kind of like what I might do with the fish shell but for a programming language.

[08:51] <zacts> ah, is there a good list of books?

[15:04] <tbrowder> vrurg: yes, but it probably ought to be in \x[nnnn] form for clarity. but there are some subtleties in there i don't recall now so i'm reluctant to revisit mods.

[15:04] *** lichtkind joined
[15:05] <tbrowder> all i did was use the code generator and captured the output, cleaned it up a bit, and voila!

[15:05] <tbrowder> oh,

[15:06] <tbrowder> and extracted the subs to a test module

[15:06] <vrurg> tbrowder: I'll be afk for some time. But I left comments on the PR with a suggestion.

[15:06] <tbrowder> ok

[15:07] <vrurg> The idea is that it is possible to use EVAL without affecting test code clarity.

[15:08] <kawaii> Is there a reliable way of a Raku script/application knowing it's own memory usage?

[15:14] <codesections> I'm not aware of one directly.  There's probably a way to use `Kernel.free-memory` and some math to get a pretty good estimate (or, at least, of how it's changing over time).  Or you could shell out

[15:15] <codesections> or use NativeCall 

[15:16] <[Coke]> didn't lizmat do some work that gives us this info?

[15:18] <kawaii> If that's the case I'd be _really_ interested in knowing how :)

[17:29] <pmurias> hi,

[17:29] <pmurias> is the growth/size of the Raku community/ecosystem somehow measured?

[17:32] <[Coke]> There are metrics that could be gathered, but I don't think anyone is

[17:33] <[Coke]> # of modules in the ecosystem list, # of people with commit bits, # of questions/participants on SO

[17:33] <[Coke]> people in the FB group, on IRC chat, perl6-users mailing list...

[17:36] <[Coke]> but I don't know of any tracking. (also: #rakulang on twitter)

[17:36] <codesections> https://finanalyst.github.io/ModuleCitation/ reports the growth in the number of published modules since 2016

[17:36] <codesections> (the 3rd graph)

[17:36] <pmurias> seems a least interesting at least to me, always found it hard to estimate how things where doing even when I was an active part of the community

[17:37] <codesections> well, that graph shows growth from 452 modules to 12,52

[17:37] <codesections> *1,252

[17:39] <zacts> I wonder if I can script vim with raku?

[17:40] <codesections> so, we've *almost* caught up to JavaScript.  Just need to increase our package count by … *checks* … 3 orders of magnitude!

[17:40] <codesections> :zacts Vim or NeoVim?

[17:40] <zacts> either actually

[17:41] <codesections> I'd *think* neovim would be pretty doable.  Wasn't multi-language extensibility part of their pitch?  But I haven't kept up 

[17:47] <tadzik> afaik as long as you can send JSON over sockets you can script neovim. Haven't done any of that though, so I could be wrong

[18:52] <codesections> I'm pretty confused.  Either I don't understand Raku's introspection or Raku is lying to me

[18:53] *** wamba left
[18:53] <codesections> I read this as saying "there is an `add` method that BagHash can call; specifically the one it gets from BagHash"

[18:53] <codesections> m: say BagHash.^lookup('add'); say BagHash.^lookup('add').package;

[18:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «add␤(BagHash)␤»

[18:53] <codesections> And I read *this* as saying "there is no `add` method in Str's inheritance graph"

[18:53] <codesections> m: say Str.^lookup('add');

[18:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[18:53] *** pmurias left
[18:53] <codesections> I am thus not surprised to get this error:

[18:53] <codesections> m: Str.add;

[18:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «No such method 'add' for invocant of type 'Str'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:53] <codesections> Here's where I *am* surprised:

[18:53] <codesections> m: say Buf.^lookup('list');

[18:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[18:53] <codesections> m: say Buf.list;

[18:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «((Buf))␤»

[18:54] <SmokeMachine> m: say Buf.^find_method: “list”

[18:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific␤implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside␤»

[18:54] <codesections> Why does `Buf.list` act like a valid method call when `Buf.^lookup('list')` just told me there *isn't* a list method in `Buf`'s object graph

[18:54] <codesections> oh

[18:55] <codesections> hmm

[19:00] <codesections> From the `lookup` docs:

[19:00] <codesections> > Returns the first matching method object of the provided $name or (Mu) if no method object was found. The search for a matching method object is done by following the mro of $obj. Note that lookup is supposed to be used for introspection, if you're after something which can be invoked you probably want to use find_method instead.

[19:00] <codesections> > The difference between find_method and lookup are that find_method will use a default candidate for parametric roles, whereas lookup throws an exception in this case, and that find_method honors FALLBACK methods, which lookup does not.

[19:01] <codesections> does that mean that `Buf.^lookup('list').defined` *should* return False, and the current behavior is a bug?

[19:02] <guifa2> codesections: was it you that was asking about wanting floating values in BagHash?  I know someone was asking about it

[19:02] <codesections> It wasn't me

[19:58] <codesections> m: Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch.find_method

[19:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «No such method 'find_method' for invocant of type␤'Perl6::Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch'.  Did you mean 'find_method'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:59] <lizmat> codesections: ^find_method

[19:59] <lizmat> it's a method on the meta-object

[19:59] <codesections> oh, right!

[19:59] <codesections> I knew that at some point…

[20:00] <lizmat> also: some of these methods only look at the methods in the class themselves, and not whether the method is inherited or not

[20:00] <codesections> Yeah.  I'm actually trying to get deep into walking the inheritance graph

[20:00] <lizmat> codesections++

[20:02] *** zacts left
[20:03] <codesections> So, how would I refer to the `^find_method` code object?

[20:04] *** andrzejku joined
[20:12] *** sena_kun joined
[20:13] <[Coke]> ^foo is shorthand - you can write it out the long way.

[20:13] <lizmat> codesections: ^find_method returns a code object?

[20:13] <lizmat> m: dd Int.^find_method("Str")(42)

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «"42"␤»

[20:14] <[Coke]> or that. ;)

[20:14] *** Altai-man_ left
[20:14] *** MasterDuke left
[20:16] <codesections> lizmat: right, `^find_method` returns the code object for it's argument.  So, your example gave me the `Int.Str` code object

[20:16] <codesections> I'm asking about the `^find_method` code object.  E.g., I want to write something like:

[20:17] <codesections> m: say &Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch.^find_method('find_method')

[20:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[20:18] <codesections> except that doesn't work, because it's looking for `find_method` as an method on `Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch`, when I guess it should be on a meta-object corresponding to that Metamodel? or something like that?

[20:19] <lizmat> codesections: so you're introspecting the introspection ?

[20:19] <codesections> Trying to :D

[20:19] *** andrew[43] left
[20:20] <lizmat> ah...  ok, that feels... bold  :-)

[20:20] <codesections> haha yeah, it's more an attempt to wrap my head around how these things work/take things apart in the REPL

[20:20] <codesections> not something I'm deploying :D

[20:22] <lizmat> it's just that as deeper you go into that, the supporting tortoises start to show up  :-)

[20:24] <guifa2> wait.... Raku(do)'s core is actually Logo?

[20:25] <codesections> That's entirely fair.  What I was actually looking at this for (er, right now; it's been a bit of a yak shave) was to decide if I should open an issue about what I discussed above: 

[20:25] <codesections> &Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch.^find_method('find_method')

[20:25] <codesections> er no, wrong paste

[20:25] <codesections> m:  say Buf.^find_method('list').defined; say Buf.^lookup('list').defined

[20:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «True␤False␤»

[20:26] <guifa2> .tell supernovus Looking over your old Timezone code.  Found some old TODOs you left in and wanted to see if we could work together to get those solved

[20:26] <tellable6> guifa2, I'll pass your message to supernovus

[20:26] <codesections> should those both be True?  Or am I misunderstanding the difference between those two meta-methods?

[20:38] <moritz> m: say Buf.^HOW

[20:38] <moritz> m: say Buf.HOW.^name

[20:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3af5833d: OUTPUT: «Perl6::Metamodel::ParametricRoleGroupHOW␤»

[20:39] <moritz> parametric roles is exactly where these two method methods differ, iirc

[20:41] *** rindolf left
[20:42] <codesections> and (dare I ask?) what is a parametric role? :D  

[20:42] <codesections> The docs tell me that "A Metamodel::ParametricRoleHOW represents a non-instantiated, possibly parameterized, role"

[20:42] <codesections> but I'm not enlightened

[21:03] <gfldex> codesections: see: https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Parameterized

[21:05] <codesections> Thanks.  I'd somehow missed that the MOP was documented on that page in addition to it's own

[21:07] <gfldex> codesections: The MOP is _one_ way to construct types. Type declarators may or may not boild down to MOP calls.

[21:08] <codesections> Oh, I thought it was _the_ way.  Thanks

[22:50] <kawaii> I don't know why I'm getting what looks to be a typecasting error when doing a simple select statement with Red

[22:53] <kawaii> Ah, I figured it out, I need to use `,` instead of `&&` here

[23:11] <tbrowder> hi, all

[23:12] <kawaii> o/

[23:12] <tbrowder> i filed an issue with rakudo and have not heard from anyone about it

[23:12] <tbrowder> kawaii: howdy!

[23:13] <tbrowder> i asked why can't a normal user query %?RESOURCES for an installed module

[23:15] *** guifa2 left
[23:15] <tbrowder> currently the %?RESOURCES hash is almost useless without some effort by a module author making a sub so a user can access the module's resources.

[23:16] <tbrowder> if you look at some of the Documentable's problems they could be solved with easier access to the RESOURCES hook.

[23:28] <tony-o> tbrowder: i have an interesting thought on an relational mapping i want to build on DB:: stuff since some precomp change hosed Xoos

[23:28] <tellable6> 2020-07-28T22:07:36Z #raku <patrickb> tony-o I commented on https://gist.github.com/tony-o/07fdf8b3a0f364b182e6034131ac224b
