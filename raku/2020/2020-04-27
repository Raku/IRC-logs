[02:06] <guifa2> Hm.  How can one work with $¢?  It's a dynamic var that's preset, BUT it seems to get set to Nil when it passes from one sub/method to another

[02:09] <guifa2> m: sub foo { say $¢ }; $¢ = "bar"; foo

[02:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 561076437: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[02:13] <tobs> guifa2: there's a mention of it in the docs, from which I gather that it's only intended to be used inside regexes https://docs.raku.org/type/Match#index-entry-$%C2%A2

[02:14] <guifa2> tobs: I'm writing a regex engine for binary blobs, so trying to align as closely as I can with the stringy regex

[02:15] <guifa2> $/ propogates correctly,but there's no way for me to set the $¢ so that, e.g., methods have access to it

[02:16] <tobs> oh, then you know more than I do

[02:26] <timotimo> oh, am i wrong?

[02:27] <guifa2> timotimo: I know in terms of the class they are the same, but my understanding is that the two are still functionally distinct (and I kinda feel like they should be)

[02:27] <guifa2> m: "aaaa" ~~ /(. { say $/.from })+/

[02:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 561076437: OUTPUT: «0␤1␤2␤3␤»

[02:27] <guifa2> each $/ is the current inner Match from the ( ... ) capture

[02:27] <guifa2> m: "aaaa" ~~ /(. { say $¢.from })+/

[02:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 561076437: OUTPUT: «0␤0␤0␤0␤»

[02:28] <guifa2> the $¢ refers to the outer Match only.  

[02:28] <guifa2> (one of those design decisions that actually feels pretty genius TBH, even if $¢ drives me crazy typing haha)

[02:28] <timotimo> hm, TIL

[10:30] <samcv> I have updated the atom language-perl6 package to support .raku. Not yet complete, but the name of the package now has raku in it, and at least i added some of the filetypes

[10:50] <abraxxa> samcv++

[10:52] <abraxxa> a search for 'raku' now suggests language-perl6

[10:52] <abraxxa> can we rename the atom package completely to language-raku?

[10:55] <samcv> abraxxa, maybe. I am not sure. Also I can't change the name of the script because other packages use that. I tried to turn "Perl 6" into "Raku/Perl 6" and https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script/ relies on that name, probably others. So there probably needs some research to find out what packages depend on "Perl 6" for script name, and source.perl6fe for scopeName. source.perl6fe is not user visible so less important to worry about (for now). But before 

[10:55] <samcv> changing it over we need to find out which packages are depending on these

[10:56] <abraxxa> is it easier to create a new package and deprecate the old one?

[10:57] <samcv> well. that is a problem for poeple updating it. Then that is the same problem that the other packages are still not compatible with a new "language-raku" package

[10:58] <samcv> ok looks like we can do a package rename. So that's nice

[11:04] <samcv> I created an issue here: https://github.com/perl6/atom-language-perl6/issues/95 to put down all that needs to happen

[12:58] <abraxxa> how can I run a program and continue the raku program flow without caring for exit codes, stdout, etc?

[12:58] <abraxxa> currently I call run('hamster-snap').so;

[12:59] <timotimo> is it important that the program keeps running even when your raku program stops?

[13:00] <abraxxa> yes

[13:00] <abraxxa> that's just a little script I call in my i3blocks config and this passes an env var to signal that it was clicked

[13:00] <timotimo> for that you'll actually want a Thread that keeps the script alive when the program isn't finished when raku is

[13:00] <abraxxa> I want to start hamster on click, but return the current working hours per day and week always

[13:00] <timotimo> hamster!

[13:01] <abraxxa> hamster 3 with Ubuntu 20.04 because it doesn't ship python 2 any more https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster

[13:01] <abraxxa> and this has no indicator support so far

[13:01] <abraxxa> at least the damn snap works

[13:02] <abraxxa> I just tried run('hamster-snap &').so; but that doesn't work

[18:50] <abraxxa> lizmat: why do you use 'their' and 'they' (plural) when speaking of someone in Raku weekly?

[18:51] *** chloekek left
[18:56] <guifa2> abraxxa: yay for English gender neutral pronouns :-) 

[18:57] *** farcas1982regreg left
[19:03] <abraxxa> plural? that sounds schizophrenic to me as non-native speaker...

[19:06] *** vike left
[19:06] <Grinnz> abraxxa: it is not ideal, but the only other option is "it" which is not used to describe people, so "them/they" is becoming more accepted as a singular gender neutral

[19:07] *** caterfxo joined
[19:07] <abraxxa> I hate the whole discussion and don't want to participate!

[19:07] *** vike joined
[19:07] <Grinnz> you asked :P

[19:08] <abraxxa> yes, thanks

[19:09] <abraxxa> I'm a white male and I have to live with it

[19:10] <guifa2> abraxxa: a singular gender-neutral they has existed in English for centuries.  Unfortunately, most English classes tend to teach it as wrong or don't mention it at all, which complicates the situation

[19:11] *** xfix left
[19:11] <guifa2> but if makes you feel any better, I find it impossible to interpret "you" as plural 

[19:11] *** xfix joined
[19:12] <guifa2> So whenever anyone gives a speech saying that "you" need to do something, I always take it personally.  Because for a group, the only optoin is "y'all" 

[19:12] <Grinnz> guifa2: and then there's people that use y'all as singular :)

[19:16] <guifa2> Grinnz: that's an urban (emphasis on urban lol) myth though :-) we tend to use it a lot when addressing a single person when we mean that person plus, for instance, the place they work at ("do y'all have X in stock?")

[19:17] <Grinnz> well, wikipedia at least suggests it's more than a myth, but certainly not widespread

[20:34] <jjatria> If I have the name of a method in a variable $foo, how can I call the method by that name in a class? I mean what in Perl would have been `$foo = 'method_name'; $obj->$foo`

[21:40] <mst> [Coke]: she might eat a bot or three

[21:40] <mst> but she's been happily munching on these fuckers everywhere else

[21:41] <mst> [Coke]: also, shit, sorry, I'd made sure she was in as many places as possible but forgot here :(

[21:41] <[Coke]> I assume we can resurrect our bots later if needed.

[21:41] <[Coke]> mst++ much less spam these days than before.

[21:42] <mst> I'd forgotten that while to *us* this channel was a 'rename' she didn't know that

[21:43] <[Coke]> mst - no worries, man.

[21:44] <mst> also if sigyn munches a bot, if an op messages her with 'unkline <nick>' within ~30min she'll fix it

[21:44] <mst> otherwise I'll go bug people

[22:14] <jjatria> Does Raku do lazy attributes? As in, attributes that have a default but that don't actually get initialised until needed?

[22:14] <jjatria> I tried a well-meaning `has $.foo is lazy = ...` but the compiler got mad at me

[22:15] <jnthn> There's nothing in the core language for that at the moment; there may be modules

[22:15] <jnthn> m: class C { has $.foo is lazy = 100 }

[22:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 561076437: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Can't use unknown trait 'is' -> 'lazy' in an attribute declaration.␤at <tmp>:1␤    expecting any of:␤        rw␤        readonly␤        box_target␤        leading_docs␤        trailing_do…»

[22:15] <jnthn> That doesn't look mad, just says it's an unknown trait.

[22:15] <jnthn> (Which it is.)

[22:16] <jnthn> Did you get something else?

[22:17] <lizmat> jjatria: perhaps https://modules.raku.org/dist/Object::Delayed could be of use ?
