[11:56] <rindolf> moritz: ah, i can try pull-reqqing it

[12:00] <MasterDuke> a/an is interesting because yes, it's chosen based on the *pronunciation* of the next word, not the spelling of the next word. so both "a SQL ..." and "an SQL ..." are correct

[12:09] <rindolf> MasterDuke: i noticed that in english "it raised few eyebrows" means something different than "it raised a few eyebrows". in hebrew, we only have "the" but not "a/an" so we use different phrasing for that. i think Slavic languages don't have "the" either

[16:13] <terminatorul> Hello !

[16:13] <JJMerelo> hey!

[16:13] <terminatorul> Is there a way to create an Encoding::Decoder and Encoding::Encoder ?

[16:14] <JJMerelo> terminatorul good question. Off the top of my head... Yes, there should be. But then I seem to remember there was some problem with them. Let me check.

[16:15] <terminatorul> Or how do I add an encoding for Windows active code page in Encoding::Registry ?

[16:15] <JJMerelo> terminatorul that's where I think the problem was. Still searching...

[16:16] <JJMerelo> terminatorul checking this...https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1964

[16:18] <[Coke]> "raised a few eyebrows" vs. "raised few eyebrows" - the latter implies that fewer people cared.

[16:18] <tellable6_> 2020-08-23T10:47:45Z #raku-dev <JJMerelo> [Coke] no problem. Thanks.

[16:19] <JJMerelo> terminatorul That class just lists the available encodings. I think that other encodings need to be hard-coded into the compiler.

[16:19] <JJMerelo> terminatorul so it's probably best if you raise an issue.

[16:20] <terminatorul> Ok

[16:25] <JJMerelo> terminatorul yep, there are quite a few. So many issues, so little time...

[16:26] <terminatorul> Would you be interested in a PR to add NativeCall specific exceptions like X::NotFound::Library and X::NotFound::LibrarySymbol ?

[16:26] <terminatorul> Instead of the AdHoc ones used now ?

[16:27] <JJMerelo> terminatorul hard to say, and it hardly matters what I'm interested in.

[16:27] <JJMerelo> terminatorul but in this case it's about new classes added to core, so it's probably best if you discuss it first in the problem-solving repo.
