[12:50] <elcaro> more cro struggles... client.get('/path/to/api?query=query+goes+here') works fine

[12:50] <elcaro> but how can i pass the query normally. i've tried `query => { query => '...' }`

[12:51] *** NODE left
[12:51] <elcaro> as well as `body` but i just keep getting 404

[12:52] <elcaro> also, when i create a request, how can i see the stringified url it's sending?

[12:52] *** NODE joined
[12:54] <jnthn> You probably don't want a body with a GET request, though I think you'd want to pass a content-type for the body too if sending one

[12:54] <jnthn> CRO_TRACE=1 in the environment will show you details of what it sends

[12:55] <jnthn> I don't think there's a convenient way to form query strings yet, though Cro::Uri provides the way to do the percent encodingt.

[12:56] <elcaro> i did have trace on, and the api reported back the value cannot be null, so i suspected the query wasn't getting passed

[12:57] <elcaro> just to be clear, this works in mojolicious with `$ua->get($path => form => { query => '...' })

[12:57] <elcaro> api docs say it's a GET, with a query param

[12:58] <jnthn> Yes, as noted, there's no better way to do it yet than putting together the query string yourself, using encode-percents on the parts. Please make an issue requesting it at https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/new

[12:58] *** wamba left
[12:59] <elcaro> ahh, sorry i missed that comment. ok, thanks... i will construct a Cro::Uri object manually

[12:59] <jnthn> It really should be there (there's plenty of conveniences for getting query string parts on the server side...)

[13:00] <elcaro> ok... i can raise an issue, but it just clocked midnight here, so it'll need to wait until tomorrow

[13:00] <elcaro> thanks again

[13:01] <jnthn> OK, thanks 

[13:02] <jnthn> I'm planning to spend some time on the HTTP client in the next week or so anyway, so can have a look at adding this too :)

[18:51] <nine> moritz: there's a weird issue with the VMs losing network. To be precise inbound packets get lost somehow. Rebooting the VM doesn't help, it's not any hardware offload, iptables or ebtables issue. A reboot of the host seems to be the only workaround.

[20:59] <rypervenche> Yay! I finally got my grammar working! It took me a while to figure out the issues with using regexes in an action, as well as the nested $matches.

[21:00] <rypervenche> I'm curious to know if I did anything horrible or inefficient in my phone-number method: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/2a42fbff2f355313059ea7df93369d08

[21:31] <MasterDuke> rypervenche: i don't see any glaring algorithmic inefficiencies. however, if you're looking to optimize, `$num .= substr(1) if $num.starts-with("9") and $num.chars == 11` might be faster than `$num = $num.flip.chop.flip if $num ~~ / ^ 9 \d ** 10 $ /`

[21:32] <rypervenche> Oh! Thanks a lot. I knew there had to be something better.

[21:32] <MasterDuke> since you already know that all the characters are numbers by the definition of the phone-number token

[21:33] *** sena_kun left
[21:33] <MasterDuke> i'm not going to promise anything, you should measure both

[21:35] <MasterDuke> and you could do the same with the following lines. e.g., `$num = "88850$num" if $num.starts-with("1" | "4") and $num.chars == 5`

[21:37] <rypervenche> Ooh, I should be able to use $/ again in that case.

[21:40] <MasterDuke> and if you want just one complicated line (and only if you know 1,4,5 are the only possible values for the leading character), `$num = "8885{ $num.starts-with("5") ?? "5" !! "0" }$num"`

[21:41] <MasterDuke> but that's a questionable "optimization"

[21:44] <rypervenche> That's lovely. I think I'll stick with the longer version since it's more understandable and extendable.

[21:45] <MasterDuke> yep

[21:46] <rypervenche> Still though, it's going to take me a while to start using the ternary operator. It's good to see more examples of how it can be used like this.

[22:13] <xinming_> What is the right way to do smart match on the $_ without using when?

[22:13] <xinming_> Something like the  m//  for smart match.

[22:15] <lizmat> .ACCEPTS ?

[22:16] *** maggotbrain left
[22:16] <lizmat> .ACCEPTS(foo)   or foo.ACCEPTS($_)  depending on what's where :-)

[22:17] <xinming_> Got it, thanks. will use .ACCEPTS

[22:20] <xinming_> hmm

[22:20] <xinming_> m: my @h = <a>, <c d e>; given @h { when (Any, List) { "Value matched".say; }; default { "Not matched".say; }; }; :(Str, List).ACCEPTS(Any, List).perl.say;

[22:21] <xinming_> How do I match do the same with ACCEPTS  for the   when (Any, List)  in this example please?

[22:25] <xinming_> I tried the @h.ACCEPTS(\(Any, List));  @h.ACCEPTS((Any, List),);  none worked

[22:27] <xinming_> @h ~~ (Any, List)   <---    In this example, How can we write it with the .ACCEPTS version?

[22:36] <lizmat> hmmmm

[22:36] <xinming_> I got it.

[22:37] <xinming_> m: (Any, List,).ACCEPTS(("5", <a b c>),).perl.say;

[22:59] <Voldenet> Is there some nice way to turn binary stdin into Supply of Buf[uint8]?

[22:59] <Voldenet> what I'm doing now is: sub raw-stdin { my Supplier $s .= new; start { loop { my $buf = $*IN.read; last unless $buf; $s.emit($buf) }; $s.done }; $s };

[22:59] *** wamba left
[23:00] <Voldenet> but do I really that thread?

[23:00] <jnthn> $*IN.Supply(:bin) ?

[23:00] *** wamba joined

[23:03] <Voldenet> apparently no, Supply only accepts buffer size

[23:19] <Voldenet> ah, `"-".IO.open(:bin);` doesn't actually open a file, so it's a better solution
