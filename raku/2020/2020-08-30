[09:58] <timotimo> oh hey finanalyst 

[09:58] <timotimo> i haven't checked the module citations in ages

[09:58] <timotimo> did we ever put a link to it in some prominent place?

[09:59] *** rindolf joined
[09:59] <JJMerelo> I think that after the experimentally-named modules were allowed to stay in there, it's broken, that one and my own "river" stuff. So it might be outdated...

[09:59] <JJMerelo> WRT that, check out my very recent answer to gfldex in the #raku-dev channel.

[09:59] <finanalyst> timotimo: When I moved from HongKong to UK, the infrastructure for ModuleCitation stopped working

[10:00] <timotimo> oh, whoops

[10:00] <finanalyst> I haven't set it up again. So it's been a year.

[10:00] <finanalyst> I could get it working again if its any use

[10:00] <finanalyst> I wasn't sure it was needed
