[08:02] <Xliff> What's the best way to parse a situation where you have nested tokens? Consider a standard Perl6 block. How would you parse it and all of the blocks under it?

[08:05] <moritz> something like

[08:06] <moritz> token stuff { <-[{}]>* }

[08:06] <Xliff> Yeah, but what if there are blocks inside of <stuff>?

[08:06] <moritz> token nested { '{' ~ '}' <stuff> [<nested> <stuff>]* }

[08:07] <Xliff> moritz++

[11:25] <JJMerelo> The 20th anniversary of the first Perl 6 RFC will be in two weeks https://raku.org/archive/rfc/1.html

[11:25] <JJMerelo> And we should celebrate.

[11:25] <JJMerelo> accordingly

[11:26] <JJMerelo> So, I've been thinking that what we could do is write 20 articles, that would pick up one specific RFC (accepted or not), pay homage to the person that created it, and also write a very short article on how it's implemented now in Raku

[11:26] <JJMerelo> We would publish one every day from Aug 1st to Aug 20th

[11:27] <JJMerelo> Possibly in the same Advent Calendar blog, because, well, opening a 20th anniversary blog is probably not worth the while.

[11:27] <JJMerelo> I'm going to create a page there, and I'm looking for volunteers. 

[11:27] <JJMerelo> Failing that, I'll designate you directly :-)

[11:27] <JJMerelo> Everyone OK with this?

[11:28] <lizmat> sounds like a plan to me!  :-)

[15:02] <Zero_Dogg> Is there any way to await two different promises, returning control once *either* has been fulfilled? If I directly "await" two, it waits for both rather than either

[15:02] <sena_kun> Zero_Dogg, Promise.anyof

[15:02] <sena_kun> `await Promise.anyof($p1, $p2)` <-

[15:04] <Zero_Dogg> How did I miss that? I've been staring at the docs for Promise… Thanks, sena_kun!

[15:04] <sena_kun> You are welcome.

[15:09] <Voldenet> Promise.anyof and Promise.allof don't work like in other languages tho

[15:11] <Voldenet> m: say await Promise.anyof(Promise.broken("eh"))

[15:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4ad4bd303: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[15:13] <timotimo> yeah, anyof is just "changed away from `planned`", not "succeeded"

[15:13] <Zero_Dogg> that's fine, I want to timeout an Proc::Async, so I'm checking the state of that afterwards anyway

[15:14] <timotimo> as you should :)

[15:16] <Voldenet> the bigger problem with Promise.allof imo is that you don't get results

[15:16] <timotimo> yeah, which is why "await" accepts multiple promises and gives you the results

[15:16] <timotimo> so that the shorter of the two does what you more likely want and the longer one is more rarely needed, but still accessible

[15:17] <Voldenet> that makes sense, it's just not the common convention

[15:18] <Zero_Dogg> raku has been really fun to play around with, lately. Wrote my first code in 2016, but now that it's much more easily accessible it's becoming my go-to

[15:19] <timotimo> what does await with multiple arguments do in other languages?

[15:22] <Voldenet> "invalid syntax" :P

[15:22] <timotimo> ok, so raku had the opportunity to huffmanize and took it :)

[19:54] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: this makes no sense, because it created the entry in the database correctly the first time, but seems on update it tries to put the wrong data in the wrong column, i.e. one of the IDs into the reputation column 

[19:54] <kawaii> We can

[19:54] <kawaii> can't get it to output the query it's running either, even with the RED-DEBUG var set

[19:58] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: we're using 0.1.22

[19:59] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: it seems to be a biting problem again

[19:59] <kawaii> but you can see here, on update, it tried to set the user-id into the reputation column for some reason :) `value "240882564770955275" is out of range for type integer`

[19:59] <kawaii> but create works perfectly

[20:01] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: is it the same code? I'll try to reproduce

[20:24] <SmokeMachine> I do have Pg installed on my machine... but I'd like a way to run it as CIon GitHub action or RakuDist (like this: https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/421)

[20:25] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: 0.1.23 should appear any moment now...

[20:25] <SmokeMachine> it's already on CPAN

[20:26] <kawaii> I'll pull the module source and just use that :)

[20:26] *** Petr37 left
[20:27] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: on, that's already there, please, let me know if that's working

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: and thanks for all the bug reports, and to be using Red )

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> :)

[20:28] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: perfect :D

[20:29] <SmokeMachine> \o/

[20:29] <kawaii> thank you so much

[20:29] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: thank YOU!

[20:29] *** squashable6 left
[20:29] <kawaii> I will be using Red for many more little projects like this in the future, so hopefully we can work to make the library even better now :)

[20:30] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: yes, please!

[20:30] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: I hope you enjoy using Red :)

[20:30] <kawaii> much nicer than just using DBIish and writing raw SQL :)

[20:30] <kawaii> even for a small project like this the codebase looks much cleaner

[20:31] *** squashable6 joined
[20:31] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: will Red have some kind of driver for working with Redis servers too in the future?

[20:31] *** Xliff joined
[20:33] *** Altai-man_ joined
[20:33] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: it was the plan at the beginning... but a lot of things still have to be thought to make that happen. the closest we have about that (yet very far) is this: https://github.com/FCO/Red-Driver-Cache-Redis

[20:33] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: but that's not what you want, and it's still a prototype...

[20:34] *** sena_kun left
[20:35] <kawaii> ah I see, a query cache :)

[20:36] <Xliff> Has any one figured out the best way to get Raku to call function pointers from C?

[20:37] <Xliff> Mind you, these are NOT function defs, but function pointer defs.

[20:37] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: one minor thing, `last_updated` is never updated on `update`, do I need to add something to my code? :) very new to this so not sure if I need to add something

[20:37] *** dolmen left
[20:37] <kawaii> I just need to call DateTime.now whenever that happens, to get the new value

[20:40] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: you could do a trigger on postgres (Red do not support that yet, and that's probable the best solution) or you can add a before-update Red phaser

[20:41] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/docs/tutorials/cookbook.md#phasers

[20:43] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: something like `method !update-time is before-update { self.last_update .= now }` should work

[20:44] <kawaii> I'll try that soon

[20:44] <SmokeMachine> I mean: method !update-time is before-update { self.last-update .= now }

[20:46] <SmokeMachine> no, that'll not work with your code... :(

[20:47] <SmokeMachine> that only works for loaded objects, and with that code you never load an object. :(

[20:54] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: not too important right now, and time for me to stop programming today, thanks for all your help though :)

[20:55] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: to use that, you'll probably need to do something like: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/KF1bEDSf/

[20:56] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: but that will be easier whe we have the create or update

[20:57] <SmokeMachine> does anyone have a suggestion of how a create or update should look on Red?

[21:31] <Petr37> can anyone recommend good  Raku book ?

[21:33] <timotimo> take a perl 6 book and pretend where-ever it says "perl 6" it means raku :) :)

[21:33] <timotimo> i don't actually have a suggestion or recommendation

[21:36] <holyghost> Petr37 : I have "Think Perl6", which is a bit old since raku but a good read, not too difficult (and there's scheme language features in it, hyphens)

[21:37] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: I will have plenty of time to test tomorrow :)

[21:38] <holyghost> You cannot program set! or nil? in raku though

[21:38] <timotimo> what do these two functions do? i assume `nil?` checks if something is Nil?

[21:39] <timotimo> and `set!` does what? like assignment?

[21:40] <holyghost> I mean you cannot use a ! or ? in raku's syntax, not the native scheme code you mentioned

[21:40] <holyghost> in lisp and scheme you can

[21:40] <timotimo> unless you use Slang::Piersing

[21:48] <rypervenche> Petr37: https://raku.guide/ is very good, if you're looking for a good site.

[21:51] <oddp> Also, some of Shitov's material is free.

[21:54] <holyghost> I'm going to buy "a programmer's guide to sound" for my scx sound system

[21:55] <holyghost> Tim Kientzle

[21:55] <holyghost> TBH

[21:55] <holyghost> it was mentioned on stackoverflow

[21:55] <holyghost> 20$ used

[21:55] <holyghost> including shipping

[21:56] <holyghost> I have an electro group called "Lost Momentum", I only have one song in the making though, a remix

[21:57] <holyghost> Involves lots of time

[21:57] <holyghost> I hate my mouse for it :-)
