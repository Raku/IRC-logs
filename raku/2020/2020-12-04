[10:13] <moon-child> rule can have whitespace around it

[10:14] <notandinus> i dont understand, can you give an example?

[10:16] <notandinus> oh nvm i found an example

[10:16] <moon-child> basically a token is a single object, the equivalent of a word.  This is like a number, a string, special char, &c

[10:16] <moon-child> and a rule is a way to combine the two

[10:16] <notandinus> :m https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars it was here

[10:16] <notandinus> i see, makes sense, thanks

[10:16] <moon-child> :)

[10:17] *** nige left

[10:32] <notandinus> going by this: https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars#Rules

[10:32] <notandinus> isn't it the opposite of what raku says?

[10:32] <notandinus> token is not ignoring the space, rule is ignoring it right?

[10:33] <notandinus> for token to match the second case we'll have to specify the space, how is it ignoring it then?

[20:33] <codesections> is there a way to allow subs that take an Associative to accept Nil? ^^^^

[20:41] <JJAtria[m]> jmerelo: I've saved the post as a draft... I think. Let me know if you need me to do anything else!

[20:42] <tellable6> JJAtria[m], I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[20:42] <tyil> a multi sub?

[20:48] <codesections> tyil: oh, of course!  Thanks

[21:11] <RaycatWhoDat> Hey. Had a question. I only have a cursory knowledge of grammars and how they work in Raku. If I wanted to make something that resembled a compiler, how would I go about that using Raku? I feel like doing something like that is definitely possible but I'm wondering if I'm just being naive...

[21:12] <tyil> RaycatWhoDat: https://andrewshitov.com/2018/11/06/creating-a-compiler-with-perl-6/

[21:12] <RaycatWhoDat> I know compilers are hard work but I was thinking of just starting with a simple interpreter and starting to build on it from ther-

[21:12] <RaycatWhoDat> oh

[21:12] <RaycatWhoDat> how convenient

[21:13] <codesections> :D much of the main Raku compiler uses grammars, too

[21:13] *** seanrobert left
[21:14] <RaycatWhoDat> mmhmm. I would just wonder how adding features would work with it. Like, if I wanted to add something as complex as pattern matching, does Raku make my life easier or harder? 

[21:15] <codesections> RaycatWhoDat: also, for examples of interpreters, seehttps://examples.p6c.dev/categories/interpreters.html 

[21:16] <RaycatWhoDat> Although, this whole effort is stemming from someone saying that Raku didn't have anything to offer in terms of compiler/interpreter design?

[21:16] <RaycatWhoDat> .*

[21:16] <codesections> (though some of those are a bit old)

[21:17] <codesections> I'm not sure I know what they meant by that

[21:18] <RaycatWhoDat> Same. They probably did the same thing people like doing: take a cursory glance at something with no real intention of learning and just wave it away

[21:19] <RaycatWhoDat> They're building a language that looks Haskell-esque with Elm, I think

[23:49] <JustThisGuy> Hi all! I have a couple of questions. I'm trying to do something like this:

[23:49] <JustThisGuy> say '"in quotes"' ~~ / '"' <-[ " ]> * '"'/;

[23:49] <evalable6> JustThisGuy, rakudo-moar 6c7044ec3: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢"in quotes"ÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[23:49] <JustThisGuy> From https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes "Enumerated character classes and ranges"

[23:50] <JustThisGuy> But, I want more that one type of quote. Something like this, but this doesn't work:

[23:50] <JustThisGuy>   token attribute_value { <quote> ([$<-quote>]) $<quote> };

[23:50] <JustThisGuy>   token quote           { <["']> };

[23:51] <JustThisGuy> I found this discussion which is also similar, but it didn't seem to go anywhere: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/97.

[23:51] <JustThisGuy> Any answers or alternatives are appreciated!
