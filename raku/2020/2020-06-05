[08:39] <sarna> hello! how do I check if a thing is present in a Seq? `contains`?

[09:07] <sarna> how to get `[1,2,3]`?

[09:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar cde948aee: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3]␤»

[09:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar cde948aee: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3]␤»

[09:31] <sarna> neat! that's more readable, imo

[09:32] <MasterDuke> or `.self`

[09:33] <sarna> weird, why would .self help here?

[09:34] <sarna> m: say [[[1]]].self

[09:59] <MasterDuke> can't use * twice in an expression to refer to the same thing

[09:59] <sarna> oh.. welp

[09:59] <sarna> I wrapped it in a block - is that the preferred solution?

[10:00] <MasterDuke> and then changed to $_? yep

[10:00] <sarna> yeah

[10:00] <sarna> thanks, it was so hard to debug :(

[10:01] <sarna> can I name the thing instead of referring to `$_`?

[10:01] <sarna> like, `@bar.grep -> $foo { $foo > 1 }`

[10:20] <tbrowder> hi, lizmat

[10:20] <lizmat> tbrowder o/

[10:23] <tbrowder> i need a token that considers this false: '#=x' but either of these true:

[10:23] <tbrowder> '#=' or '#= '

[10:24] *** JJMerelo joined
[10:25] <jnthn> tbrowder: Something like: '#=' <![x]> ' ' (well, or whatever appropriate kind of whitespace you want)

[10:25] <jnthn> Uh, ' '? on the end there

[10:25] <jnthn> But you probably don't want a literal space

[10:25] <tbrowder> yes, a trailing decl line. the bare '#=' on a line is the problem.

[10:26] <tbrowder> the

[10:28] <tbrowder> i should have shown the second true token as '#=\h \N*'

[12:26] <ThomBoyer> docs.raku.org frequently mentions `truthy` and `falsy`, and sometimes `truish`. They're not in the glossary, and I can't find proper definitions anywhere on the site. Is there one somewhere?

[12:29] <moritz> ThomBoyer: it means "true when evaluated in a boolean context"

[12:29] <moritz> like 0 is falsy and 1, 2, 3 are truthy

[12:29] <ThomBoyer> Right. But even class Bool doesn't define what's true in a boolean context.

[12:29] <moritz> ThomBoyer: it would be great if you could add it to the docs

[12:31] <moritz> right, that's under the sovereignty of the objects in question

[12:31] <moritz> Int defines it for Int, Str for Str and so on

[12:32] *** Kaeipi left
[12:34] <ThomBoyer> I'd summarize as: A value is falsy if it's Bool::True, a Numeric equal to zero, or an empty container of a built-in type (Str, Hash, etc). For non-builtin classes, it's whatever its `.Bool` method says

[12:34] <ThomBoyer> Is that accurate?

[12:34] *** Kaiepi joined
[12:36] <ThomBoyer> That's pretty close to Perl5's definition, except that "0" seems to be different from Perl 5. Which led me to search out a more precise definition.

[12:39] <moritz> it's Bool::False

[12:39] <moritz> otherwise pretty good

[12:39] <moritz> also, type objects are falsy as well

[12:39] <ThomBoyer> Heh. Yeah. I sure _hope_ True isn't falsy. :-)

[12:40] <ThomBoyer> And I'd forgotten the type-object thing. Ok. Thanks, moritz.

[12:42] <moritz> well, those Raku people... :D

[13:06] <sarna> except forth and lisp

[13:07] <sarna> by the way, I've been thinking about this `self` stuff.. why does it "unpack" the nested thing? I mean it's cool, but how does that work?

[13:07] <sarna> m: say [[[[[[1]]]]]] # I mean this

[13:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1cefecc9: OUTPUT: «[1]␤»

[13:07] <jnthn> That's nothing to do with `self`, but rather the single argument rule

[13:08] <sarna> okay what, I forgot .self and it did the same thing

[13:08] <sarna> jnthn: where can I read about it? I saw a comment on reddit but I didn't fully grasp it yet :(

[13:08] <jnthn> https://docs.raku.org/language/list#index-entry-Single_Argument_Rule

[13:12] <sarna> I read this one already, but this time I'll follow up with the p6advent article. maybe it will click now :)  thanks

[13:27] <sarna> oh darn, so everything unpacks stuff like [[[1]]] automatically.. so I don't need the `self`! nice

[20:56] <melezhik> .tell tbrowder are you talking about testing modules with RakuDist?

[20:56] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[20:59] <tbrowder> yes, but pushed from my local host. including rakudo branches if possible.

[21:01] <melezhik> to run RakuDist jobs one could use HTTP API - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/docs/api.md#queue-build

[21:01] <melezhik> are you branches available from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/ ?

[21:01] <melezhik> if so, you can also use specific sha to point a certain branch (commit)

[21:03] <melezhik> it all would work if your modules are hosted on github/gitlab 

[21:03] <melezhik> not sure if this is what you need ...

[21:05] <melezhik> but basically you'd start with a following request (just an example) - `curl -d thing=https://github.com/Kaiepi/p6-Kind sha=f0594084e88e3d36bdcbc220989c7c823233876b http://rakudist.raku.org/queue`
