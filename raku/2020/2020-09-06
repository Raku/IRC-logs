[00:04] <b7j0c> since the name change to "raku", is the `use v6` pragma still required? or is there a new pragma?

[00:08] <[Coke]> it was always optional. 

[00:09] <[Coke]> if you specifically want v6.c or v6.d, use it - otherwise, you get the latest version of language supported available.

[00:09] <b7j0c> awesome, thanks!

[17:49] <codesections> Why does ^^^^ print with the `#` escaped?

[17:50] <codesections> moritz++ thanks

[17:51] <moritz> (not so relevant for visual output, but there are tools that parse TAP and put it into DBs, hilight for HTML etc.)

[20:15] <discoD> hello. I've written docs for a library I want to submit, but I'd like to take a crack at writing some of it as POD. If someone could recommend a module with well-written POD to use as an example, I'd appreciate it. I don't care if it's your own.

[20:25] <Xliff> m: use Test; ok(False,'\#')

[20:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´not ok 1 - \ \#‚ê§# Failed test '\ \#'‚ê§# at <tmp> line 1‚ê§¬ª

[20:25] <Xliff> m: use Test; ok(False,'##')

[20:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´not ok 1 -  \# \#‚ê§# Failed test ' \# \#'‚ê§# at <tmp> line 1‚ê§¬ª

[20:25] <Xliff> moritz: So how do I get a naked '#' when using Test?

[20:27] <moritz> Xliff: what do you need a naked # for?

[20:28] <moritz> you can emit comments (starting with #) with diag

[20:28] <moritz> m: use Test; diag('oh noez');

[20:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´# oh noez‚ê§¬ª

[20:28] <moritz> or, you know, say '#'

[20:29] <Xliff> moritz: Well, something like this, for example...

[20:29] <Xliff> m: use Test; ok(True,'Test #1 successful')

[20:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - Test  \#1 successful‚ê§¬ª

[20:29] <Xliff> It just doesn't have the right flair any other way. :p

[20:31] <codesections> m: use Test; ok(True, 'md lvl 4 header: #### Title')

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - md lvl 4 header:  \# \# \# \# Title‚ê§¬ª

[20:31] <Xliff> codesections: That was my thought, too. But nooOOoo...

[20:32] <codesections> Xliff: no, I knew that wouldn't work -- I was agreeing with you about it being annoying.  That seems like an *especially* bad set of output.

[20:33] <codesections> the `####` becomes basically unreadable 

[20:33] <Xliff> Yep

[20:33] <Xliff> m: use Test; ok(True,'Test #=1 successful')

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - Test  \#=1 successful‚ê§¬ª

[20:34] <Xliff> m: use Test; ok(True,'Test =#1 successful')

[20:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - Test = \#1 successful‚ê§¬ª

[20:34] <Xliff> There should be a way of escaping that.

[20:34] <Xliff> Just sayin...

[20:36] <codesections> m: ok(True) ?? note("Test #1 sucessfull") !! note("Test #1 failed")

[20:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Undeclared routine:‚ê§    ok used at line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[20:37] <codesections> m: use Test; ok(True) ?? note("Test #1 sucessfull") !! note("Test #1 failed")

[20:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - ‚ê§Test #1 sucessfull‚ê§¬ª

[20:37] <codesections> That _kind of_ works.  Except for the newline.  And the fact that it's clunky

[20:40] <Xliff> codesections: Yeah, that is. Thanks for the workaround, though!
