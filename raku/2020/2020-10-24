[13:04] <rindolf> hi all! timings for raku vs. perl5 vs. cpython3 vs. pypy3 : https://paste.centos.org/view/c6678045 ; for https://projecteuler.net/problem=313

[13:06] <rindolf> raku takes about a second which is acceptable, but not as good as the others which are south of 100ms

[13:07] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[13:12] <lizmat> rindolf: where does the code live for the raku solutions ?

[13:15] <rindolf> lizmat: here: https://paste.debian.net/1168532

[14:36] <lizmat> rindolf: not yet, was working on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3982

[14:37] <rindolf> lizmat: ah, ok

[14:39] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[14:43] <lizmat> rindolf: ah, it seems I need a primesieve library for that to test

[14:44] <rindolf> lizmat: yes, what is your OS?

[14:45] <lizmat> MacOS Mojave

[14:47] *** parabolize joined
[14:47] <rindolf> lizmat: ah, which package manager are you using ?

[14:47] <lizmat> none

[14:48] <rindolf> lizmat: i see: then do the wget + cmake + make install dance. :)

[14:49] <lizmat> the benchmark is not about libprimesieve is it?

[14:51] *** andrzejku joined
[14:52] <rindolf> lizmat: i use libprimesieve in all the codes; well - its bindings

[14:55] *** patrickb joined
[14:55] <lizmat> I've just build an Iterator class on top of nqp::isprime_I

[15:02] <lizmat> rindolf: instead of squar($x) do $x * $x

[15:03] <lizmat> instead of assigning, you could use binding, so:

[15:03] <lizmat> while ( ( my $x := $gen.pull-one ) < $top )

[15:03] <lizmat> that makes it about 8% faster for me

[15:05] <rindolf> lizmat: ah, let me see

[15:05] <lizmat> also: instead of ( ( $maxstart - 1 ) / 6 ).floor()

[15:05] <lizmat> do: ( ( $maxstart - 1 ) div 6 )

[15:06] <lizmat> that's another few percent has that doesn't need Rat creation / handling

[15:06] <lizmat> *as

[15:07] <dogbert17> can't the return statements be thrown away as well

[15:10] <lizmat> well, yes, but if sub square is not called, then there's only the final return in calc_needed, which wouldn't make a dent  :-)

[15:11] <dogbert17> true :-)

[15:11] <lizmat> ah, and also: $ret = $ret + foo   is faster than  $ret += foo

[15:11] <dogbert17> the 'int trick then, i.e. declaring all vars in the while loop as int

[15:12] <lizmat> that *could* probably work, but then it wouldn't for bigger values

[15:12] <lizmat> so that would be changing the semantics, I'd say

[15:13] <dogbert17> there's a risk involved but in this example it does actually work

[15:13] <lizmat> true, but that feels like cheating ?

[15:13] <lizmat> I mean, it could be written in NQP as well, and be faster :-)

[15:14] <dogbert17> all true :-)

[15:14] <dogbert17> lizmat: btw, thanks for closing #3378

[15:14] <lizmat> yw

[15:20] <dogbert17> lizmat: another thing, while browsing through the cases a noticed a report where jnthn have suggested a solution, but alas it has never been implemented

[15:21] <lizmat> which one?

[15:21] <dogbert17> G#3027

[15:21] <dogbert17> argh, which lesster should it be

[15:21] <dogbert17> *letter

[15:22] <dogbert17> R#3027

[15:22] <linkable6> R#3027 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3027 [regression] Infinite loop when passing a pair with a junction in the key to a sub with destructuring

[15:55] *** BenGoldberg joined
[15:56] *** Sgeo joined
[15:59] <rindolf> lizmat: dogbert17 : "div" and ":=" do seem to make a difference - about 0.87s now

[16:00] <lizmat> yeah, that prevents having to create Rat intermediate results

[17:40] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: http://paste.debian.net/1168553/    <-- Here, How do I fix this issue? If module and app are in the same file, the relationship works fine. But when I extract the DB thing into a module, and use that module, Red will try to load the model with the model name.

[17:41] <xinming_> if the relation model is DB::B, We must have a file named DB/B.rakumod to fix the issue, as Red will try to require once

[17:42] <xinming_> I tracked down, the issue is in `class ReferencesProxy does Callable {` within file Red::Column module, But I don't have much clue on how it should be fixed.

[17:43] <SmokeMachine> You can use `:require<module::to::load>` to fix that

[17:50] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: in this case: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dohTlVy9/

[17:50] <SmokeMachine> `has Int $.a-id is referencing(*.id, :model<DB::A>, :require<DB>);`

[17:52] <El_Che> weekly: updated rakudo-pkg and support for Ubuntu 20.10

[17:52] <notable6> El_Che, Noted! (weekly)

[18:02] <brass> tyil: I haven't really, I only use a Mac for work, so I haven't been playing around with R* on it too much

[18:40] <patrickb> El_Che++

[18:40] <El_Che> patrickb: it's using containers iself, as the problem does no occur with podman

[18:41] <El_Che> one of those crazy bugs that take a long time to find because they make no sense at all :)

[18:42] <patrickb> Did you have a look at the azure configuration? It's a giant collection of workarounds for this kind of problems... I can empathize a lot!

[21:53] <sena_kun> El_Che, is out.

[21:53] <El_Che> sena_kun: yeah, pushed a build on pkg-rakudo in a branch to test it

[21:54] <El_Che> (but travis has been slow to start jibs lately)

[21:54] <sena_kun> El_Che, how much does it take?

[21:54] <sena_kun> It is pretty late here, but I'd still like to know if I have to cry or not before going to sleep. :S

[21:55] <El_Che> normally it starts right away and it build 4 targets in parallel

[21:55] <El_Che> eacht take around 11 to 12 minutes
