[10:22] <fluca1978> I've a question about 'multi': why we should mark a sub/method with multi? If we don't the compiler will not allow it, so it seems to me Perl is smart enough to find out the method is duplicated. Why whould then explicitly say it's a multi method?

[10:22] *** ensamvarg99 left
[10:23] <El_Che> fluca1978: the compiler? sure

[10:23] <El_Che> the programmer, less so

[10:23] <El_Che> :)

[10:23] *** ensamvarg joined
[10:24] <El_Che> what is you redefine the sub on an other file?

[10:24] <fluca1978> El_Che: therefore is just a "warning" to ask the developed he knows what he is doing, right?

[10:25] <El_Che> the "use warnings" or "use strict" in Perl 5 

[10:25] <El_Che> I'd rather have a strict compiler, but opnions diverge on that I suppose

[10:25] <jnthn> It can avoid quite a few surprises

[10:25] <El_Che> Some people say compilers are really dumb

[10:26] <jnthn> Especially if you declare an only sub in a scope, and their happens to be something in an outer scope with the same name

[10:26] <El_Che> Still, a compiler is probably smarter than me :)

[10:26] <jnthn> If that thing in the outer scope were to be refactored into a set of multis, then you might be in for a surprise.

[10:26] <fluca1978> El_Che: clear! It was a doubt because it reminds me the "virtual" of C++ methods...

[10:26] <jnthn> You might thing "why'd I do that", but you might not; some module you import might

[10:27] <El_Che> fluca1978: languages like go get away by not allowing it, or the classical dynamic langauges by not caring

[10:27] <El_Che> multi is a nice middle ground, imho

[10:27] <jnthn> Quite a few things in Raku are designed to preserve refactorability - whether you're doing it by hand, or to make it possible to implement more reliable tools to do it for you

[10:27] <fluca1978> El_Che jnthn: thanks

[10:28] <fluca1978> another question: I'd like to get a MAIN named argument act as a global variable, like MAIN( Bool :$verbose ), so that I can check it in whatever class I am into. Does that sounds dangerous? How can I do something right with that?

[10:28] <El_Che> in my view, while staying dynamic in nature, raku is trying hard to fix some problems typical with dynamic languages, e.g. by moving failures to the compile phase instead of runtime

[10:29] <jnthn> fluca1978: Declare it as Bool :$*verbose (a dynamically scoped variable)

[10:29] <jnthn> It's the same danger as all dynamic scoping, I guess

[10:31] <jnthn> Ah, and you access it as $*verbose too

[10:33] <fluca1978> jnthn: thanks, that is what I was looking for! shame on me I didn't think about $*

[18:40] <TreyHarris> Can anyone think of a core routine name that's used for two entirely different things depending on type? (semantically entirely different, not just multis)

[18:40] <jmerelo> stoned75: it will probably have grown by accretion, with new operators added as soon as they were created or simply being noticed.

[18:41] <TreyHarris> like, the old example Dog.bark() and Tree.bark()

[19:42] <guifa> But would need a mentor who‚Äôs got the time (jmerelo‚Äôs got too much on his plate to add it).  Anyone potentially interested?

[19:43] <guifa> samcv: I know you did GSoC as a student and I‚Äôve been meaning to play around with your Unicode sort work, but no idea if you‚Äôd have time

[19:52] <sjn> El_Che: suggestion: produce sha256 checksums too?

[19:53] <El_Che> sjn: sure, it's changing 1 line :)

[19:53] <El_Che> or maybe gpg sigining

[20:07] <melezhik> I _probably_ found the issue with p6doc install under user, where can I put a ticket? - http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/reports/p6doc/alpine/1580241616.txt

[20:09] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Gnome::Glib (0.15.5.3) by 03MARTIMM

[20:11] <[Coke]> what is "cpan-p6doc-alpine" ?

[20:11] <tellable6> 2020-01-28T18:28:43Z #raku <jmerelo> [Coke] OK

[20:12] <lucasb> 'raku -v' says "This is Rakudo version (...) implementing *Perl* 6.d"

[20:13] <lucasb> shouldn't it be implementing the new language Raku instead? :)

[20:13] *** zakharyas joined
[20:13] <sena_kun> well...

[20:14] <melezhik> Coke: it's local user under which zef install gets run for p6doc module

[20:14] <melezhik> [Coke]: it's local user under which zef install gets run for p6doc module

[20:14] *** rindolf left
[20:15] <[Coke]> would you expect to be able to install into the system directory with that user?

[20:16] <melezhik> no, but the problem is when others modules use the p6doc their installs fails for the same reasons

[20:16] <melezhik> for example - http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/reports/IP%3A%3AAddr/debian/1580239499.txt

[20:16] <melezhik> I mean user install should be successful 

[20:17] *** antoniogamiz joined
[20:17] <antoniogamiz> o/

[20:17] <Voldenet> isn't there some support for local manpath?

[20:17] <antoniogamiz> do you know some docker container with raku and zef installed?

[20:18] <Voldenet> alpine-perl6

[20:18] <Voldenet> https://github.com/JJ/alpine-perl6

[20:18] <[Coke]> I don't understand. you're able to install *other* modules to your system folder with zef, just not p6doc?

[20:19] <antoniogamiz> Voldenet: thanks :D

[20:22] <Voldenet> Question: Is there any way to defer statements for the block? I want to do conditional "close after opened", but I'm not sure how to implement this

[20:23] <[Coke]> basically, if that user can't create files or dirs in /opt/rakudo-pkg ... then I'd expect any zef install to die with a similar error. P6doc may be "special" in that it's copying things in addition to raku lib files. (more)

[20:23] <[Coke]> if others are working, maybe you have permissions setup properly for *part* of /opt/... 

[20:23] <stoned75> Voldenet: may be https://docs.raku.org/language/phasers#LEAVE

[20:23] <Voldenet> LEAVE is always being called, even if there's return before it

[20:24] <[Coke]> It's hard to tell if you're doing anything else given the log format here (rather than, e.g. a typescript of an install)

[20:24] <stoned75> IC

[20:24] <Doc_Holliwood> A comment needs likes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gddK-cOxYc&t=0s It's the one linking to raku

[20:25] <melezhik> Coke: the install is dead simple. It's 

[20:26] <melezhik> zef install p6doc under $user

[20:26] <[Coke]> do any zef installs work for you in this env?

[20:27] <rypervenche> I also ran into this p6doc issue because it tries to install things in /usr, I think.

[20:27] <[Coke]> I see Test::When in the pre-reqs, if you need one to test.

[20:27] <[Coke]> ok, but it's not complaining about /usr in the logs you show.

[20:27] <melezhik> and then _for some_ reasons `zef install` tries to mkdir /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/doc which is obviously is forbidden for none privileged user

[20:27] <[Coke]> Just trying to see what the root cause is.

[20:28] <rypervenche> My installation is different. Let me get my own logs, one sec.

[20:28] <[Coke]> (/usr) oh, two different people. :)

[20:29] <melezhik> Coke: the test/installation script is written on Sparrow and could be found here https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/modules/default/sparrowfile. Again nothing complicated here

[20:30] <[Coke]> (create dir): https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/master/Build.pm6#L12

[20:30] <rypervenche> [Coke]: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/76e0c2211fdd41970538ffd5cb84dede

[20:30] <melezhik> it just create a `$user`, then fetch zef distribution , then `cd to $distribution_dir` and then `zef install .` , the last command run _under_ $user

[20:30] *** MasterDuke joined
[20:31] <[Coke]> So you've got a restricted permission area and you're trying to copy files into it with a non-restricted user.

[20:31] <[Coke]> sorry s/non-restricted user/user who doesn't have privs/ ?

[20:32] <melezhik> well then thing _I_ am not doing this. It's done by `zef` or other piece of code not controlled by test scenario ( well me )

[20:33] <[Coke]> Let me back up. Why are you trying to run this as this specific user?

[20:34] <melezhik> because this I test _user_ install

[20:34] <[Coke]> ... ok. but if the user doesn't have permissions, why do you expect it to work?

[20:34] <melezhik> because I test user install

[20:35] <[Coke]> I wouldn't expect a random test user to be able to install into /opt

[20:35] <melezhik> I do not. IMHO it's bug. Install process should not try to create files in /opt/rakudo-pkg/ when gets run under user. 

[20:35] <[Coke]> then look at the line I linked earlier.

[20:35] <[Coke]> it's not a problem with zef, perse.

[20:36] <[Coke]> er, per se.

[20:36] <melezhik> so, you mean this _should be_ overridden somewhere else?

[20:36] <rypervenche> I came into this late. So it's not possible to install p6doc using zef as a simple user?

[20:36] <melezhik> looks like that

[20:36] <[Coke]> I'm saying the Build step for p6doc is explicitly creating a directory and copying things.

[20:37] <melezhik> technically it results in zef install fails for p6doc under $user

[20:37] <[Coke]> I am not saying whether that's right or wrong. But it explains the issue with the non-priveledged user you're seeing.

[20:37] <[Coke]> it's not a zef issue, though. zef is just doing what the lib says to.

[20:38] <[Coke]> p6doc switched to this Build *years* ago when we moved the pod from 'lib' to 'doc' folder inside the module.

[20:39] <[Coke]> It was intended to be a transparent way to get the pod to end up in the target lib directory.

[20:39] <melezhik> yes. I knew that. another question If someone's module _use_ p6doc as a dependency will it fails when gets installed under $user?

[20:39] <[Coke]> if they're using p6doc, it has to be installed.

[20:40] <[Coke]> so then it's still p6doc's install failing.

[20:40] <[Coke]> Would be my guess.

[20:40] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Gnome::Gtk3 (0.22.0.2) by 03MARTIMM

[20:40] *** theantidaniel joined
[20:40] <melezhik> yeah, here is example of fail - http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/reports/IP%3A%3AAddr/debian/1580239499.txt

[20:40] <[Coke]> I am still surprised you're able to install ANY modules with an unpriveledged user, but I don't know how your system is setup.

[20:41] <melezhik> there is no surprise , because modules get installed into $user paths not system 

[20:42] <[Coke]> Looks like chunks of Build.pm go back to 2016

[20:42] <[Coke]> How are you passing those paths to zef?

[20:43] <melezhik> I don't pass $users paths to zef it happens out of the box when you run zef under $user

[20:43] <[Coke]> I can't read what the sparrow file is doing entirely.

[20:43] <[Coke]> When you say "under $user" can you be more specific? do you mean *as* the user?

[20:43] <melezhik> su $user

[20:43] <melezhik> then - zef install $stuff

[20:43] <melezhik> yes . as the $user

[20:44] <[Coke]> Looks like you're not using your own zef.

[20:44] <[Coke]> Are you copying it in from /opt/rakudo-pkg in that file? wonder if that's related.

[20:44] *** sena_kun left
[20:45] <melezhik> no it does not. it's only the case for alpine

[20:45] <melezhik> the same error is for debian

[20:45] <melezhik> let me find a report for debian

[20:46] <rypervenche> Note: Please note that, due to changes in the parsing of Pod6, this will fail in versions of Raku older than 2018.06. Please upgrade to that version, or install using --force.

[20:47] <melezhik> http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist/reports/p6doc/debian/1580244331.txt

[20:48] <rypervenche> p6doc finally installed for me when I added --force to my zef command.

[20:48] <rypervenche> See: https://github.com/Raku/doc#install-p6doc

[20:48] <[Coke]> Guessing that $*REPO in your install is still pointing at /opt/rakudo-pkg for some reason

[20:48] <[Coke]> rypervenche: I imagine the force is just ignoring the error, at which point, do you have the docs installed?

[20:48] <melezhik> I enabled bash debug in this test, so all underlying commands are seen now

[20:49] <melezhik> "$*REPO in your install is still pointing at /opt/rakudo-pkg for some reason" - this was my though two

[20:49] <rypervenche> [Coke]: I have it installed now, yes. It wasn't getting past that error until I ran it with --force and it just ignored it after that and continued with the installation.

[20:49] <melezhik> it's run under docker, not sure if it's relevant anyway ...

[20:54] *** zakharyas left
[20:54] <rypervenche> Hmmm, p6doc doesn't seem to be working though.

[20:55] <[Coke]> rypervenche: that's what I'd expect, if you force away the error, you'll get an install with no pod

[20:55] <Voldenet> m: my \x = class { method CALL-ME { say "allright" } }.new; x()

[20:56] *** sno joined
[20:56] <melezhik> "that's what I'd expect, if you force away the error, you'll get an install with no pod"  - yeah

[20:56] <rypervenche> That seems odd to me that there's no way to install this module as a user. I don't install things into root-owned directories outside of my package manager, so for my Raku modules I'd like to install them as my user (or via my package manager).

[20:59] <[Coke]> trying a local install now.

[20:59] <melezhik> under docker ideally ((((=;

[21:00] <Voldenet> uh, there should be scopes for project/user/system

[21:00] <Voldenet> raku-modules is a cheerful name

[21:00] <[Coke]> Do you have a dockerfile?

[21:00] *** sena_kun joined
[21:02] <[Coke]> under a local git checkout, did "$ zef install ." - it got to ===> Testing: p6doc:ver<1.003>:auth<perl6> and is stalled

[21:02] <melezhik> so no luck with local install?

[21:03] <melezhik> you can test on docker using Sparrowdo - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist#low-level-api

[21:03] <melezhik> the scenario will be dead simple

[21:04] <melezhik> `user $user; zef "p6doc", %( user => $user )`

[21:04] <rypervenche> Let me update my zef and try again.

[21:05] * [Coke] finds https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2896

[21:05] <[Coke]> I am probably not going to install sparrow.

[21:05] <antoniogamiz> is there a way to install a module without testing its dependencies?

[21:06] <antoniogamiz> (using zef)

[21:06] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> add --/test

[21:06] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> to the end of the command

[21:06] <antoniogamiz> but --/test also avoids the module tests i think

[21:06] <[Coke]> if you want to run all tests for your module but not the deps, you can install the deps first.

[21:06] <antoniogamiz> i want to test the module, but not its dependencies

[21:07] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> ah

[21:07] <[Coke]> zef --deps-only --/test

[21:07] <melezhik> Coke: it's up to you. But this is how one can easy repeat the test on docker

[21:07] <[Coke]> then 'zef install <thing>'

[21:07] <antoniogamiz> mmmm thanks coke :)

[21:07] <[Coke]> the issue is in the Build file; someone else will have to figure out the right code to put into Build.pm, unfortunately.

[21:08] <[Coke]> melezhik: 

[21:08] <[Coke]> 16:06 < discord6> <theangryepicbanana> add --/test

[21:08] <[Coke]> melezhik: https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2896 - I'd follow that. I added my notes about Build and why it is that way, hopefully that helps someone figure out the fix.

[21:10] <rypervenche> [Coke]: Thanks for that. I'll be watching it as well.

[21:13] <melezhik> Thanks Coke: I've added my comment

[21:28] <uzl[m]> lizmat++ for this Rakudo weekly.

[21:28] <uzl[m]> .seen jmerelo 

[21:28] <tellable6> uzl[m], I saw jmerelo 2020-01-28T18:41:48Z in #raku: <jmerelo> stoned75: I guess that you can add it wherever and increase the entropy :-) 

[21:28] <TreyHarris> lizmat++ for weekly too

[21:29] <uzl[m]> Totally. I always look forward to reading it every week :-)!

[21:34] <lizmat> thanks, glad to hear  :-)

[21:36] <uzl[m]> .tell jmerelo I've generated the documentation and hosted it on a Github repo (https://uzluisf.github.io/rakudoc/). However, all the links are relative so I'm wondering if there's way to set up a base url before generating the HTML like you could do with some static site generators (https://ar.al/2018/06/20/override-baseurl-in-hugo-server/).  BTW, kudos for all the work with Documentable; generating the documentation couldn't be

[21:36] <uzl[m]> easier now.

[21:36] <tellable6> uzl[m], I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[21:37] <uzl[m]> Np, lizmat!

[21:39] <rypervenche> tyil: Well..., I did a make clean and then make install and then it installed correctly...
