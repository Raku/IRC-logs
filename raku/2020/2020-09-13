[00:44] <kleb> hi everybody!

[00:45] <kleb> I have been debugging this incredibly bizarre error when running raku, and I think I almost have it figured out.  The behavior is incredibly odd

[00:46] <kleb> i was hoping to describe it here and see if anybody might know what i can do to work around it! i think it might be a bug in the interpreter itself, but don't know the project well enough to diagnose it yet

[00:48] *** riceandbeans joined
[00:53] <kleb> ------------- file: bin/script#!/usr/bin/env rakuuse v6;use lib 'lib';use MyLibrary::Graph;use MyLibrary::Scrape;sub MAIN {    do_stuff(); #this function is from MyLibrary::Scrape}------------- file: lib/MyLibrary/Scraper.pm6use MyLibrary::CompletionChannel;#require Data::Dump::Tree<&ddt>;our sub do_stuff(@seed) {    say "do_stuff";    #ddt @seed;

[00:53] <kleb> my $chan = Channel.new;}-------------- file: lib/MyLibrary/Graph.pm6## large file with lots of functions declared "our", as well as some use statements

[00:55] <kleb> aw dang it didnt space or indent...

[00:55] <kleb> here it is on pastebin: https://pastebin.com/raw/qx2zhfNQ

[00:55] <kleb> that is a basic idea of the code that is breaking 

[00:56] <kleb> but the behavior is **almost** non-deterministic.  I think i figured out how to deterministically make it break, but this certainly seems like a bug in raku

[00:56] <guifa> What’s is the actual error that it’s giving?

[00:57] <kleb> here is the error:

[00:58] <kleb> https://pastebin.com/raw/6WwiRARd

[00:58] <timotimo> kleb: do you ever access hashes or arrays from multiple threads at the same time?

[00:58] <kleb> not in this program stub

[00:58] <timotimo> oh, that's not the kind of error i was expecting

[00:58] <kleb> i stripped it back to the minimal broken example

[00:58] <timotimo> can you use "raku --ll-exception ./bin/runner"?

[00:59] <guifa> Do you still get the error if you comment out MyLibrary::Graph?  Or are things okay without it?

[01:00] <kleb> here is the --ll-exception output: https://pastebin.com/raw/Lktihuji

[01:01] <timotimo> oh, 2020.01, is that your raku version?

[01:02] <timotimo> ah, right, rakudo-star

[01:02] <timotimo> there is a rakudo star of 2020.05 available

[01:02] <timotimo> https://rakudo.org/star

[01:02] <kleb> if I comment out MyLibrary::Scrape in ./bin/runner, and call a function from MyLibrary::Graph it works find.  If I then comment out MyLibrary::Graph, and call that function in MyLibrary::Scrape, it works fine.  If I then uncomment MyLibrary::Graph, it **still** works fine! but then if I change one line of code in MyLibrary::Scrape (from one space

[01:02] <kleb> to two spaces, for example) it breaks!

[01:03] <kleb> it works fine***

[01:03] <timotimo> can you try deleting the .precomp folder in lib/ ?

[01:03] <kleb> if i delete the .precomp folder in lib after getting the error, i still get the error

[01:03] <timotimo> fascinating, but as i said, it's quite possible that whatever the bug is was already fixed since then

[01:04] <kleb> but then if I comment out MyLibrary::Graph, run it again, it works! then i uncomment that **exact** same line MyLibrary::Graph and it breaks again!

[01:04] <kleb> i am using package manager default raku :)

[01:05] <kleb> ill try with the very latest and see if i get it again

[01:05] <timotimo> you can try setting RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG and see if that gives any interesting output

[01:05] <kleb> wow RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG is hyper useful

[01:06] <kleb> thank u for that one :)  you guys are awesome 

[01:07] <timotimo> no problem!

[01:07] <kleb> what does "late loading" mean in the context of that debug output?

[01:08] <timotimo> not sure

[01:09] <kleb> https://pastebin.com/raw/WqAZsTYp

[01:10] <kleb> thats my output when it is **working** with both use statements uncommented

[01:11] <timotimo> huh i wonder where the "Python" comes from that is being compared against in one spot

[01:11] *** molaf left
[01:12] <timotimo> oh, you're using Inline::Python, that could have something to do with it

[01:12] <kleb> and this one is the output from when it is broken: https://pastebin.com/raw/dZ0avZQB

[01:12] <kleb> i am indeed using inline python from the MyLibrary::Graph module

[01:13] <kleb> playing around with some networkx code

[01:13] <kleb> but none of that stuff is getting called when it is breaking i dont think...

[01:14] <timotimo> i'm going offline now, but i hope you get it to work!

[01:14] <kleb> thanks!!! 

[01:14] <timotimo> o/

[01:14] <kleb> the two commands you gave have already helped me so much thank you!!

[01:15] <kleb> it looks like i am getting:  Outdated precompiled 

[01:17] <kleb> but then i delete ./lib/.precomp and still get the same error

[01:17] <kleb> i will try the newer raku

[01:17] <timotimo> i wonder if the lib/.precomp is actually the wrong one?

[01:17] <timotimo> perhaps "use lib" gives it trouble

[01:18] <timotimo> no it does look like it's looking at lib/.precomp

[01:21] <kleb> it is errors like these that really teach how everything works under the hood :p

[01:21] <kleb> i just switched to the newest raku with rakubrew and am reinstalling my modules

[07:53] <tellable6> 2020-09-12T20:53:45Z #raku-dev <ggoebel> JJMerelo Thank you for doing the survey. -MasterDuke mentioned you helped someone transfer some of their modules to raku-community-modules. Is that process documented anywhere?

[07:55] <JJMerelo> .tell ggoebel yes I did... but then the amount of modules the community was in charge of increased by 30% and I wasn't too happy about it https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/210 My current opinion is that it's much better to get someone else to adopt your module. The community modules should be a last resource.

[07:55] <tellable6> JJMerelo, I'll pass your message to ggoebel

[09:02] <El_Che> I didn't comment om being already in Oreilly's Safari. I don't know if it's a good thing for you or not

[09:03] <moritz> I finished my review October 24th, so it was a bit less than a month turnaround for me

[09:04] <stoned75> hi. in the gist https://gist.github.com/42c42d4e3dddf89c314ee4af0863e0d2 I'm trying to pinpoint what caused this behavior change in rakudo 2018.10. anyone would have an idea ?

[09:04] <moritz> but then this was a second edition, so maybe they had less work in production

[17:50] <pel> I'm curious as to why Raku does not use LLVM like many new languages do: Rust, Swift, Kotlin, etc... Is it because LLVM diid not exist when MoarVM was created, or because it's too complicated?

[17:51] <lucs> pel: Ask in #raku-dev maybe?

[17:52] *** sjaveed left
[17:53] <codesections> can LLVM output bytecode?  I think of it as aimed at machine code, but I'm certainly no expert 

[17:55] *** Sgeo joined
[17:56] *** Geth left
[17:57] <pel> It outputs LLVM IR bytecode. Raku compiles down to JVM bytecode I think (I'm no expert)

[23:11] <guifa> You need to have {} before matches are available

[23:12] <guifa> I don’t remember the exact reason why, but has something to do with *waveshands* LTM and optimizations

[23:12] <guifa> but I don’t think it’s intended to be that way forever

[23:12] <guifa> In the first two examples, you’re working on code blocks, so matches are by default available
