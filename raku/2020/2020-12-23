[08:20] <coldpress> so I see from https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#Structs that CStructs can have CPointers. How do I define a CStruct for a node of a linked list?

[08:23] <moon-child> coldpress:  class CIntList is repr('CStruct') { has int64 $.n; has CIntList $.next; }

[08:24] <moon-child> iirc

[08:25] <coldpress> m: use NativeCall; class CIntList is repr('CStruct') { has int64 $.n; has CIntList $.next; }; CIntList.new(n=>0, dest=>CIntList.new(n=>1)).say; CIntList.new(n=>0, dest=>CIntList.new(n=>1)).dest.say

[08:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´CIntList.new(n => 0, next => CIntList)‚ê§No such method 'dest' for invocant of type 'CIntList'.  Did you mean‚ê§any of these: 'does', 'gist', 'list', 'List'?‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[08:26] <coldpress> m: use NativeCall; class CIntList is repr('CStruct') { has int64 $.n; has CIntList $.next; }; CIntList.new(n=>0, next=>CIntList.new(n=>1)).say; CIntList.new(n=>0, next=>CIntList.new(n=>1)).next.say

[08:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´assign requires a concrete object (got a CIntList type object instead)‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[08:26] <coldpress> moon-child: ^^

[08:26] <coldpress> I'm trying has Pointer[CIntList] instead of has CIntList, and that doesn't seem to work either

[08:27] <moon-child> you shouldn't need a pointer; has makes a pointer by default.  (You need to use HAS to embed a structure by value)

[08:27] <moon-child> maybe try the TWEAK trick from the page you linked?

[08:28] <coldpress> wouldn't that create an infinitely big linked list?

[08:28] <coldpress> also, I want to create a circular list; so I don't think I can use TWEAK here

[08:29] <moon-child> sure, but you can make a private method that binds to 'next' privately

[08:32] <moon-child> http://ix.io/2JeF/perl6

[08:33] <coldpress> I see, thank you very much

[09:30] <kawaii> what's the right way to string together these conditionals in the following statement? `if $content ~~ /^^@questions/ and $content ~~ / ?$$/ and rand < 0.01 { say 'yes' };`, `@questions` is an array of opening words i.e. `my @questions = 'can', 'when', 'should';` and `$content` is well, a question ending in `?`. :)

[10:05] <moritz> for the checks to pass as written, it is enough if $content starts with one of the @questions on any line, and ends on a question mark on any other line

[11:10] <jmerelo> tib_: from rakubrew? Or rakudobrew?

[11:11] <jmerelo> tib_: ah, OK, that's not it. Not really sure about sources, but the rest seems to be a precomp repo.

[11:12] <tib_> yep, it contains files like : AFED9027E812967FC8734CD341F7951801F8B86C

[16:42] <tony-o> i'd like to see your list of stuff todo, and i renamed the repos in the monkey patch for zef

[16:43] <patrickb> Do you plan to keep fez dependency free?

[16:44] <patrickb> https://modules.raku.org/dist/Terminal::Getpass:cpan:TITSUKI could be the simple solution for the password problem.

[17:43] <notagoodidea> Hi, a weird question : What is the different using & or 

[17:44] <tadzik> & or what? :)

[17:44] <notagoodidea> $ sigils for function declaration as in : my &foo = {...} and my $l = {...}

[17:44] *** Manifest0 left
[17:44] <notagoodidea> (Sorry enter key slipped :))

[17:44] <tadzik> ah :)

[17:45] <tadzik> using &foo allows you to then call it as foo(), without the sigil, in practice

[17:45] <tadzik> under the hood, I'm not sure :o

[17:46] <moritz> the other thing is that & implies the Callable role

[17:46] <moritz> so you're giving the optimizer a type hint

[17:46] <notagoodidea> With &, I also can use an infix function call but not with $.

[17:46] <moritz> and the reader

[17:47] <notagoodidea> There is one that stand out as a good practice? (Based on the use of sigils, I tend to favor & but I am pretty new at Raku)

[17:48] <moritz> yes, using the sigils tends to be good idea

[17:49] <tony-o> notagoodidea: use & if you're calling something Callable, use $ if you're intending use of a scalar

[17:49] *** Manifest0 joined

[22:10] <notagoodidea> [Coke]: Because of you, I am trying it but I am stuck in a stupid place. When I open the input file with "foobar".IO.lines, I got an array of string. How to convert it to Int ?

[22:11] <patrickb> timotimo: Any gut feeling? (Yours is probably worth more than mine)

[22:11] <timotimo> my gut tells me raku dists are usually pretty small, so unless it's catastrophically slow, it should be all right

[22:11] <MasterDuke> notagoodidea: `.map(*.Int)` or `>>.Int`

[22:11] <[Coke]> notagoodidea: "1.txt".IO.lines.map(+*) should work

[22:12] <[Coke]> but raku will also DTRT most o the time with "32" when you mean 32

[22:12] <[Coke]> m: say "32" == 32

[22:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[22:12] <notagoodidea> Yep when for sorting the data, raku don't as string can ordered it seems.

[22:14] <notagoodidea> *be

[22:14] <patrickb> Ha! There is no gzip, but there is a tar which can compressK

[22:15] <[Coke]> you can tell sort to sort by a function

[22:15] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <100 1 10 102 110 9 8>; say @a.sort(+*);

[22:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´(1 8 9 10 100 102 110)‚ê§¬ª

[22:16] <[Coke]> so you can keep the originals as strings, sort them numerically... or convert them to numbers up front... (on one of the challenges, I stored them as keys in a hash which re-stringified them... so then I didn't bother making them numbers first...)

[22:16] <notagoodidea> Ah. I made it work based on the documentation with @data.sort({$^a.fc > $^b.fc}) but using the max method after gave me the wrong anwser as the data where not converted to an number.

[22:17] <timotimo> why call .fc on it if it's supposed to be numbers?

[22:18] <notagoodidea> a sad case of "blindly copying the documentation and it worked"

[22:20] <timotimo> you should really replace the whole thing with .sort(+*) like coke said earlier

[22:22] <notagoodidea> But when doing that the resulting elements are still string (after "ffo".IO.lines.sort(+*))

[22:22] <MasterDuke> that's just sorting them numerically, they're still strings

[22:22] <notagoodidea> but doing "foo".IO.lines.map(+*).sort gives me the intended list

[22:23] <MasterDuke> yeah, now you're converting to numbers first

[22:23] <patrickb> .tell tony-o password reading seems to work on my machine. (Unless the server accepts empty passwords and the prompt just ignored all input or something similar went wrong).

[22:23] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tony-o

[22:24] <notagoodidea> Ah ok, I began to understand that sorting is not a in-place operation or at least destruction (if it were the case, the casting due to the sorting will stay).

[22:27] <MasterDuke> correct

[22:59] <[Coke]> is there a method to check equality on arrays or must I compare by element (current cheat: .join them and str compare)

[23:00] *** patrickb left
[23:00] <lizmat> You mean: you have two arrays, and are equal positioned elements the same ?

[23:01] <[Coke]> all elements.

[23:01] <[Coke]> right.

[23:01] <lizmat> [Coke]: you know the number of elems is the same?

[23:01] <[Coke]> Also: is it expected that a shaped array has extra "blanks" off the end when dd-ing?

[23:01] <[Coke]> lizmat: y

[23:01] <lizmat> m: dd ?all((1,2,3) >>==<< (1,2,3)

[23:03] <timotimo> do not recommend assigning a shaped array like that

[23:03] <[Coke]> ok, what's the right way?

[23:03] <timotimo> m: my @a := Array.new(:shape(3,3)); dd @a

[23:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´Array element = Array.new(:shape(3, 3), [Any, Any, Any], [Any, Any, Any], [Any, Any, Any])‚ê§¬ª

[23:04] <[Coke]> Roger, trying the bind

[23:04] <[Coke]> ... doh. had two arrays, only ONE was shaped, also.

[23:05] * lizmat sees [Coke] is in good hands, so feels free to goto sleep&

[23:06] <[Coke]> ~~

[23:06] <[Coke]> ... ok, failing differently at least.

[23:06] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2,3) eqv (1,2,3)

[23:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´Bool::True‚ê§¬ª

[23:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b6b2e070: OUTPUT: ¬´Bool::False‚ê§¬ª

[23:07] <[Coke]> timotimo: how to copy one shaped array into another @var ?

[23:07] <timotimo> i think assigning a shaped array into a @var[3;3] with a matching shape will work?

[23:09] <[Coke]> if I do "@old = @new" I get "must provided structured data", if I do "@old = @new" I get an error further along (digging into that one.)

[23:11] <[Coke]> it complains about the structure of that one, getting Index out of range. Is: 1, should be in 0..0  -- trying to index with 0;1 at that point on a thing with a shape of 97;97 - throwing in some .shape calls..

[23:13] *** aluaces left
[23:14] <[Coke]> aha.

[23:14] <[Coke]> my @thing = stuff(@old) - if stuff returns a shaped array, also have to bind there or lose the shape.

[23:54] <guifa2> Any examples of moduels that show off some seamless integration with Raku at an core / syntaxy level? 

[23:55] <guifa2> I'm thinking here of stuff like Cro (with its faux control blocks), Red (with its metamodels and traits) or my own DateTime::Timezones
