[00:41] <rypervenche> Is the ":my" supposed to be a "my" on https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars#Dynamic_variables_in_grammars ?

[00:45] <leont> No

[00:45] <leont> That's how you declare a variable inside a rule

[00:45] <leont> Without the colon it would match text, instead of being code

[00:48] *** epony joined
[00:49] <rypervenche> Ah ok.

[00:58] <leont> It's not very common to encounter, I just happen to know because YAMLish very much depends on the feature

[10:06] <Altreus> I've asked a similar question before but - I have classes that need to know about each other, so that I can correctly use multi dispatch based on type. Is there a way of doing this without making an empty role for them both to consume, or empty parent class or something like that?

[10:09] <Altreus> I was hoping I could somehow declare the existence of the type while remaining agnostic about the implementation of it

[10:28] <lizmat> that works, as long as it's in the same compunit

[12:18] <moritz> when I try to call it, I get Cannot locate symbol '(null)' in native library '(null)'

[12:19] <moritz> any idea why it might try to call '(null)'?

[12:24] <moritz> (and the is native($pyhelper) works for other functions)

[16:10] <benlittle> Hello! Are there any existing projects for auto-completion in raku? Similar to what jedi is for python.

[16:12] <timotimo> Comma has rathor competent completion

[16:12] <benlittle> Isn't comma closed source?

[16:12] <timotimo> at the moment, yes

[16:12] <benlittle> ☹

[16:13] <benlittle> But at least it's a start

[16:24] <benlittle> What's the base grammar for the rakudo compiler? If I wanted to build a lexer, I imagine I should subclass from that.

[16:46] <timotimo> the rakudo parser and one for autocompletion have different goals

[16:46] <timotimo> one wants to reject wrong programs, the other wants to recover from mistakes, since there'll be a place where the user is currently editing

[16:47] <El_Che> benlittle: the community comma edition is free as in beer

[16:48] <El_Che> (I need yet to find a bar with free beer, but that's an other topic)

[16:56] <benlittle> My only concern with closed source is that I want to understand the workings of the language better. That's also why I asked about the rakudo parser, as no matter what I do, I will need to have an idea of what the parser is actually doing with any given snippet of code.

[16:57] <Ulti> El_Che: are you nxadm on GH?

[16:57] <Ulti> I'm the other guy \o.

[16:58] <Ulti> sorry if it came across as attacking rakudo-pkg I just wanted confirmation its repl.it not updating rather than you

[16:59] <Ulti> glot.io has the same problem

[16:59] <Ulti> it freezes everything from the last time the config was touched

[16:59] <Ulti> which is quite unfortunate

[17:46] <Altreus> Why did it get considered to be a single value, and not an array going into an array container?

[19:34] <dertyhgtrfrde> Exactly like the icon of a Ruby file have a ruby

[19:34] <Altai-man_> dertyhgtrfrde, what system do you use? I am not sure there should be any icon anywhere, except you are using Comma IDE.

[19:36] <dertyhgtrfrde> I will not

[19:37] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: I'm assuming that your file manager does not have an icon for Raku yet.

[19:37] <dertyhgtrfrde> Do you have a butterfly ?

[19:37] <dertyhgtrfrde> rypervenche what should I do ?

[19:37] <Altai-man_> dertyhgtrfrde, I am not sure we'll be able to help without knowing which program do you even use to display your files.

[19:37] *** ctilmes left
[19:38] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: You could request that it get added upstream. I'm assuming you are seeing this in your file manager. If so, which one are you using?

[19:38] <rypervenche> What OS are you using and what version?

[19:39] <rypervenche> Also, you need to be patient. People here are volunteers and are not always available to answer questions right away. There is no need to spam "please", someone will respond when they are available to.

[19:40] <dertyhgtrfrde> thunar

[19:41] <mst> solution: stop caring about the icon, focus on learning the language

[19:42] <rypervenche> I think that might be a GTK icon theme that handles that. I could be wrong there.

[19:42] <mst> dertyhgtrfrde: this is not a raku problem and you should ask your distro's IRC channel for help instead.

[19:42] <rypervenche> Yeah, your distro's channel will be able to help you find where to request its addition.

[19:43] <dertyhgtrfrde> mst I could not program if there is not icon

[19:43] <dertyhgtrfrde> It's not even an option

[19:44] <dertyhgtrfrde> ok I will ask the distro

[19:44] <dertyhgtrfrde> thanks

[19:44] <mst> you can program whether there is an icon or not.

[19:44] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: Even if you get it added upstream, it won't be available on your distro for at least one version upgrade. So unless you add it yourself, with that attitude you won't be coding in Raku.

[19:44] <mst> you run 'raku myfile.rk' in the shell

[19:44] *** gordonfish joined
[19:45] <mst> dertyhgtrfrde: so no, that simply isn't true.

[19:45] <dertyhgtrfrde> mst I think you don't understand

[19:45] <mst> dertyhgtrfrde: you do not need an icon to program.

[19:45] <mst> that is not true./

[19:45] <rypervenche> By the way, .raku is the chosen extension for Raku files.

[19:45] <dertyhgtrfrde> mst You are a genius

[19:46] <mst> rypervenche: ah, sorry, my mistake

[19:46] <mst> dertyhgtrfrde: you ran your file?

[19:46] <dertyhgtrfrde> when I say I need the icon it's becaue

[19:46] <dertyhgtrfrde> because I don't like when there is no icon

[19:46] <rypervenche> Oooh, I think I see. Have you been running your scripts simply by double-clicking on them?

[19:47] <mst> well, learn enough about your distro to install an icon then, I guess

[19:47] <mst> my linux installs don't have icons for anything

[19:47] <dertyhgtrfrde> the fact is that the script should be ported on a lot of distro

[19:48] <rypervenche> Same, although I used to use Faenza icons when I used graphical file managers.

[19:48] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: What distro and version are you using?

[19:48] <dertyhgtrfrde> it is not only for my computer, my distro

[19:48] <El_Che> rypervenche: download an icon, right click on the file, change the icon on the basic tab, on the "open with" tab change the executable to raku

[19:49] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: El_Che's message is for you.

[19:49] <El_Che> sorry :)

[19:49] <dertyhgtrfrde> Thanks

[19:50] <dertyhgtrfrde> Hope a lot of distro will add an icon soon

[19:50] <rypervenche> dertyhgtrfrde: They likely won't unless someone requests them. If we knew what distro you were using and therefore what icon theme, we could look into seeing how to get it added.

[19:50] *** sena_kun joined
[19:52] <El_Che> I see that .py and .p6 get an icon

[19:52] *** Altai-man_ left
[19:52] <El_Che> .p6 gets a cartoonish camel head :)

[19:53] <El_Che> it means if you used the .p6 extension for now, you'll have your icon

[19:53] <El_Che> distro's will catch up soon

[19:56] <El_Che> dertyhgtrfrde: in case you want to report so people packaging stuff notice, you can post it here: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues

[19:56] <Doc_Holliwood> Watching the german workshop videos. Man I relly wanted to be there.

[21:22] <patrickb> I just watched the replay of the GPW2020 Raku Q&A session. The last question was about how to package a Raku app on Windows so someone that has no Raku installed can use it.

[21:26] <regreg> patrickb, was there a reasonable asnwer to that question? i'm interested too

[21:26] <patrickb> Since no one mentioned it I'd like to point out that the relocatable precompiled rakudo releases that are available since a while can be used to create bundles that will run on someone elses machine. These packages contain zef and modules installed with that bundled zef are also part of the bundle then.

[21:28] <patrickb> So I'd say that's a really simple way to create bundles.

[21:29] <patrickb> regreg: The answers that were given in the talk were a last years google summer of code project that worked on creating actual executable binaries for raku programs (it's not production ready yet and only works on linux) and the recommendation to use Docker.

[21:30] <regreg> i'm on windows

[21:30] <regreg> using wsl

[21:30] *** wildtrees left
[21:30] <regreg> but i want to implement my game engine AI in raku

[21:32] <patrickb> regreg: Sounds interesting!

[21:32] <regreg> i actually have 2 projects, a stock market game and a civilization-like game

[21:33] <patrickb> regreg: As advertised above, have a look at the precompiled release archives on rakudo.org They should run out of the box on Windows and can be used as the base for a raku program bundle.

[21:34] <patrickb> regreg: Is the source code available somewhere to have a look?

[21:34] <regreg> $ rakudo --version

[21:34] <regreg> This is Rakudo version 2020.01 built on MoarVM version 2020.01.1

[21:34] <regreg> implementing Perl 6.d.

[21:35] <regreg> no, it's a commercial game

[21:35] <regreg> indie game

[21:35] <regreg> if we hang around i might give you a license once i finish it :)

[21:35] <regreg> which might take about 1 year or so

[21:35] <patrickb> lizmat, nine, moritz: ^ See above for another approach to packaging raku apps on Windows.

[21:36] <regreg> this is the output from my windows installation of rakudo

[21:36] <regreg> in git bash

[21:36] <regreg> mingw

[21:37] <patrickb> regreg: I'm not much into gaming (any more), more interested in the inner workings of the games nowadays. But thanks for the offer! :-)

[21:40] <tadzik> regreg: sounds interesting, keep us updated :)

[21:41] <regreg> i'm using raku mostly because of multimethods, i don't like using lisp syntax anymore
