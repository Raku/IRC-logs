[21:14] <codesect`> is there a better way to conditionally call a function?  right now I have something like `.&{ :$condition ?? .fn !! $_ }` but that feels clunku

[21:15] <lizmat> well, apparently you want to call the method on $_ when a condition is met

[21:16] <lizmat> and otherwise pass on $_, right ?

[21:16] <codesect`> yeah

[21:17] <codesect`> and the problem is that most conditionals don't pass on $_; they return Nil when false

[21:18] <lizmat> yeah, or Empty, but yeah

[21:18] <codesect`> oops, right

[21:18] <lizmat> but to be honest, what feels clunky to me in that example, is the use if .&{ ... }  :-)

[21:21] <codesect`> yeah.  Maybe `(.fn if $condition) // $_` would be a better way to say it

[21:23] <codesect`> (though that might need to be wrapped in extra (), depending on what's around it)

[21:54] <patrickb> Is it expected, that a script called as `raku -I. bin/script.raku` won't be able to access the resource files? If not I'll rakudobug...

[22:02] *** maggotbrain left
[22:08] <lizmat> I don't think so: %*RESOURCES is internal to a module only, is it not ?

[22:09] <patrickb> Is there any way to make a script part of a module?

[22:11] <patrickb> This gave me a huge WAT yesterday. (Didn't figure it out until a few minutes ago.)

[22:11] *** k-man joined
[22:15] <lizmat> if you control the module, then you could think of adding a class method that exposes its %*RESOURCES ?

[22:17] *** wamba left
[22:17] <patrickb> I guess that's what I'll do. Create a lib folder with a rakumod file in my module. Feels like overkill in a module otherwise only consisting of a 87 line script and three resource files...

[22:23] <patrickb> Just so I understand this correctly. `.raku` files are never considered to be part of a module, correct?

[22:23] <lizmat> that's my understanding, yes

[22:25] <patrickb> Ok. Thanks for clarifying! I'll try to get this doc-ed somehow. :-)

[22:41] *** Altai-man left
[22:42] *** patrickb left
[22:45] <codesect`> upon coming back to that section of my code, I think `?$condition Rxx .fn || $_` is a clearer way to say what I want to say

[22:47] <codesect`> (`?$condition && .fn || $_` also works, but the precedence isn't quite as clear, imo)

[22:56] <lizmat> if the result of .fn is false, is it the intent that $_ is used ?
