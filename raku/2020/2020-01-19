[13:36] <jjmerelo> Good thing about outreachy, it needn't be a strictly code project. It can be documentation, or web, or really anything that can attract someone to our community.

[13:37] <jjmerelo> It's addressed specifically at women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply

[13:38] <jjmerelo> Check out their page, I think it's great that the Perl Foundation has allocated funds for this this year https://www.outreachy.org/

[14:29] <rir> Hi.  On raku.org, I could not find reference to method calls with trailing colon.   I guess this is new in the last 8 or so years.

[14:29] <rir> Any clues appreciated.

[14:30] <atroxaper> rir: Hi. You can call foo($arg1, $arg2); or foo: $arg1, $arg2;

[14:32] *** mahmudov joined
[14:32] <atroxaper> rir: everything from : to ; will be used as arguments.

[14:32] <rir> Thanks.  And a bare foo:  means what multimethod-wise?

[14:34] <rir> My initial meeting is:  self.bless:

[14:36] <rir>       :%opts  }  # closing statement brace

[14:37] <jnthn> The : here is a "precedence drop"; it means the rest of the statement is interpreted as the argument list

[14:37] <jnthn> It's useful if the arguments will span multiple lines, or for example be a block

[14:37] <jnthn> As in $lock.protect: { #`(many lines of code in the block }

[14:37] <jnthn> Um, missed the ) of the comment

[14:38] <jnthn> That way you save needing to worry about a closing ) and the } end of statement rule means no need for a ; either

[16:40] <MasterDuke> perl6 --profile script.raku

[16:41] <MasterDuke> see where is slow. a local profile of just doing those two statements looks pretty similar to me. slowest thing with a bare sort is MERGESORT-REIFIED-LIST, if i do it with a block it's MERGESORT-REIFIED-LIST-WITH which is a little slower

[16:42] *** sena_kun left
[16:44] <Doc_Holliwould> That just hangs

[16:47] <Doc_Holliwould> ah

[16:47] <MasterDuke> creating a profile slows the whole program down by a bit, can you reduce the size of the input? and i wouldn't try profiling your whole script, just a cut down version with the slow sort (and then another cut down version with the fast sort to compare)

[16:48] <Doc_Holliwould> my code read in a text file, so i had an array of 10000 strings (that contain ints). so the sort block did a str to int conversion every time

[16:49] *** domidumont joined
[16:56] *** sena_kun joined
[16:57] <MasterDuke> yeah, that would slow things down some. not sure i would expect it to be 15x slower though...

[17:01] <MasterDuke> huh, the block form is way slower for an array of Strs. but `sort(+*)` is just about as fast as if they're Ints

[18:54] <moritz> right, you can do something like $passwd ~~ / .* <[a..z]> .* & .* \d .* & <[|"/&%$]>.* /

[18:55] <moritz> but in the end, it's good form to give different error messages depending on which is missing, so you maybe want three different regexes indepdently

[18:55] *** jmerelo joined
[18:57] <Doc_Holliwould> it's good not to impose arbitrary rules onto the user, that won't help anybody but the attacker

[18:58] *** sena_kun joined
[18:58] <Doc_Holliwould> when you say "at least this and one of that" you are narrowing the search space

[18:59] <Doc_Holliwould> just require a minimum length of 12, or even 18 characters, and maybe check against a dictionary

[19:39] <jmerelo> stoned75++

[19:40] <jmerelo> I just updated docs.raku.org, will re-generate to include this

[19:40] <stoned75> hi jmerelo!

[19:42] <stoned75> btw this has the side effect of adding yet another (sub)page having the same "defect" as the one reported in https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3159

[19:42] <jmerelo> stoned75: yep, I noticed

[19:42] <jmerelo> stoned75: there's still an issue with the names of those subpages. 

[19:43] <stoned75> I guess Documentable could use some work on this aspect

[19:43] <jmerelo> stoned75: we'll probably have to check ad-hoc indexes and maybe generate errors or something

[19:43] <jmerelo> stoned75: it needs some work on all aspects

[19:43] <stoned75> eh :)

[19:43] <jmerelo> stoned75: I am going to kidnap Antonio next week, or when he finishes his exams to get to work on this.

[19:44] <stoned75> cool ! btw I'll be in fosdem, I'll drop by to say hi! :)

[19:44] <jmerelo> stoned75: ah great!

[19:44] <jmerelo> stoned75: I think I have stand duty on Sunday morning

[19:45] <stoned75> that's cool

[19:46] <stoned75> stand spotted on the map ;-)

[19:48] <jmerelo> stoned75: something is wrong with the generation, but I can't really find what

[19:48] <jmerelo> stoned75: let me check

[19:50] <stoned75> was ok for me :-}

[19:52] <jmerelo> It's OK, I guess... It's generated the page, the date and time has changed, but I still see the old file, even locally.

[19:52] <stoned75> btw don't you want to run the whole docs generation in the travis pipeline ? or is it too costly ?

[19:53] <stoned75> oh I tend to kill and restart mojo on each update, as I haven't yet figured out when an updated was picked up

[19:53] <jmerelo> stoned75: the problem is that it's a two-phase thing. documentable start generates the initial cache, then documentable update does the next ones

[19:54] <jmerelo> stoned75: it takes less than it used to, but there are few errors that will be caught generating the documentation that will not be caught by the tests

[19:56] <stoned75> ok IC

[20:02] <stoned75> btw that is the '[io grant]' reference in some commits ?

[20:02] <jmerelo> stoned75: a grant requested by Zoffix Znet in 2017, I think

[20:02] <jmerelo> stoned75: it was used to indicate that those commits were part of the grant.

[20:03] <jmerelo> stoned75: the content of the grant was about speeding up and completing IO in Rakudo

[20:03] <jmerelo> stoned75: let me see if I find it

[20:03] <stoned75> from the perl foundation ?

[20:03] <jmerelo> stoned75: right http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2017/05/completion-report-perl-6-io-tpf-grant.html

[20:04] <stoned75> that was cool

[20:05] *** domidumont left
[20:05] <jmerelo> stoned75: I regenerated the documentation. https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Ignore works now

[20:05] <jmerelo> stoned75: and that's another issue for documentable. It does not work some times

[20:05] * jmerelo goes AFK to dinner. See ya!
