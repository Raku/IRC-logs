[01:46] <autarch> Hi all. I'm not sure who to ask about this so I'll ask here. I've filed for a trademark on "Raku" in the US on behalf of TPF. There were a couple objections raised by the trademark office (see https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88782119&docId=OOA20200427#docIndex=1&page=1&tdrlink= for the letter). One of the issues is that the raku

[01:46] <autarch> website does not show the "raku software" available for download, only "rakudo".  So basically we need a download link or button that says "Raku" somewhere.

[01:49] <autarch> The other objection, BTW, is about our translation of Raku, but that's easily dealt with by taking a screenshot of Google Translate.

[01:52] <vrurg> autarch: would it be ok for you to open an issue in https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues ?

[01:54] <vrurg> autarch: It's not that easy to gather all involved parties at one time on IRC.

[01:54] <autarch> Sure, no problem

[01:54] <vrurg> autarch: Thank you!

[11:04] <xps> The suggested syntax to be used for declaring that a function agument is a function of a specific type is not very easy to find in the docs.

[11:04] <xps> A tiny tiny example on the functions page suggests sub f(&c){ c() * 2 }; under the section argumens

[11:05] <xps> But you you have to make sure you don't blink or you might miss it

[11:05] <xps> But now I'm trying to figure out how to make anonymous functions work well with functions that type their function valued arguments like that

[11:05] <xps> I can write a sub with the correct signature and pass that function and all is good

[11:06] <xps> But I can't seem to find a way to write a lambda that "gives it the right type"

[11:08] <Altai-man_> m: sub a(&foo) { say foo(42); }; a(-> $x { $x * 2 })

[11:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a902b5e4: OUTPUT: «84␤»

[11:08] <Altai-man_> xps, like ^?

[11:08] <xps> https://privatebin.net/?a116d18c37fb2e66#AT9jnopQ3rdD1RgWGHtmkT8PxRjiLnrcWDft6um1qR5p

[11:09] <xps> It works if I don't type the functions, if I leave the function argument "dynamic" then it's all good

[11:11] <Altai-man_> m: sub foo (&g:(Int --> Int)) { g(42) }; say foo(-> Int $i --> Int { $i });

[11:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a902b5e4: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[11:11] <Altai-man_> m: sub foo (&g:(Int --> Int)) { g(42) }; say foo(-> Int $i, --> Int { $i });

[11:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a902b5e4: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[11:12] <xps> Also correction, it was on the signature page this line was given that shows the syntax for typed function arguments: sub f(&c:(Int)) { } -- under signature literals section

[11:14] <xps> Altai-man_: Now that syntax is very confusing I must say

[11:14] <Altai-man_> xps, the difference is that you don't need parentheses for lambda params, I think. Can you please create a ticket at https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues describing your opinion on this particular docs issue (or just share a link to this conversation)?

[11:14] <xps> It does not make immediate sense to me that I would call foo with what looks like two arguments

[11:15] *** upupbb-user2 joined
[11:15] <Altai-man_> xps, the foo definition is the same, it's the lambda.

[11:15] <xps> Ok I could consider doing that when I've ironed out how these things actually work and understand it

[11:15] <xps> Yes I get that foo is the same, it's the calling convention that looks confusing to me

[11:15] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Rake (0.0.2) by 03ELIZABETH

[11:15] <Altai-man_> m: -> Int $a, Int $b --> Int { say $a + $b }

[11:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a902b5e4: ( no output )

[11:16] <Altai-man_> It's a matter of preference, maybe. Raku does not favor parens and they can be omitted in a lot of places. E.g. `if True {}` instead of `if (True) {}` or `foo;` instead of obligatory `foo();`.

[11:16] <xps> I do get the syntax now, but boy is it ambiguous to me

[11:17] <Altai-man_> xps, ambiguous with that else?

[11:17] <xps> Provided this would be written out in the arguments to a function call the comma in this lambda trips me up while reading

[11:17] <xps> But this is all familiarity I understand

[11:23] <xps> Altai-man_: Thanks for the help

[11:27] <Altai-man_> xps, you are welcome. Also, another way is just not type everything, but probably that's not the way you prefer it. Also, should I create the doc ticket or you'll go for it?

[11:29] <xps> I very much do prefer to leverage strict typing as much as I can, I like that raku can do both. If you want to go ahead and make a simple ticket linking to this converstation that would be excellent, otherwise I might try later to make on

[11:30] <Altai-man_> xps, I'll make one, thanks for reporting about it.

[17:06] <notable6> El_Che, Noted! (weekly)

[17:08] <timotimo> guifa2: that's correct, subs are stirctly lexical scoped

[17:08] <guifa2> Ugh.  Rakudo core making slangs more difficult ;-)

[17:08] <timotimo> toss the sub into Rakudo::Internals :D

[17:09] <guifa2> Ha.  Thankfully I can still copy and paste

[17:10] <guifa2> But at least I finally got the slang to recognize the binex declarator, so I might have this looking closer to standard regex sooner than I thought

[17:10] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Net::BGP (0.6.0) by 03JMASLAK

[17:12] <timotimo> very good

[17:12] <guifa2> Is there a way that I can get output during the comp phase?

[17:12] <timotimo> "get" output?

[17:13] <guifa2> Ops like say/spurt/print don't seem to do anything

[17:13] *** daxim left
[17:15] <timotimo> that sounds odd. you are in p6 code, yes? you want to output something while the script using your module is being imported, or something similar?

[17:16] <timotimo> maybe you're running into precompilation making your code only run once, and i think output during precomp is potentially nommed by the process starting the precomp

[17:16] <timotimo> since it's using stdout/stderr to communicate anyway

[17:18] <guifa2> In the slang grammar, I'll put in a code block like { say "can you hear me now?" } .  When that token is used, no output is presented.  

[17:19] <guifa2> but maybe it's just rerouting output somewhere else.  I remembering running into this once with zef but I can't remember if I ever figured out anything for it

[17:19] <timotimo> you can strace -f to get stuff from all processes spawned from the one you're stracing, and maybe -e write or so

[17:19] <timotimo> then in the millions of lines of output you'll hopefully see your debug output

[17:19] <timotimo> otherwise, i'd recommend opening a temp file somewhere and writing into that

[17:20] <guifa2> temp file sounds better :-)

[17:21] <guifa2> Most of the trouble right now is just getting my head around all of the internals on how regexen get installed, as protos, multis, etc, and introspection can be helpful 

[17:21] <timotimo> right

[17:22] <timotimo> have you ever tried the debugserver?

[17:22] <timotimo> it's not perfect and the commandline interface a little clunky, but it could potentially help

[17:22] <guifa2> Not yet

[17:23] <guifa2> Although I actually have a fair amount of time no to play around with those tools

[18:17] <guifa2> arg, dangit

[18:18] <guifa2> there's a lexically scoped variable that there's no way I can access even if I copy and paste in because the core subs won't modify it

[18:18] *** sena_kun left
[18:18] <lizmat> guifa2: which one ?

[18:18] *** stoned75 joined
[18:19] <timotimo> then give access through a method until you can find a better way, just to be able to experiment more?

[18:19] *** ctilmes left
[18:19] <guifa2> $use_vm_binder

[18:19] <guifa2> lizmat: would it be safe to just use false for it for now?

[18:20] <guifa2> hrm, actually maybe it's just being set outside to avoid multiple allocations?

[18:44] <guifa2> There's a line that returns NQPMu.  How can I access that in regular Raku?  use core; or use core::NQPMu doesn't seem to find it

[18:49] *** vmv left
[18:50] <timotimo> i'm not sure if you can actually

[18:50] <timotimo> but it should respond to annul check

[18:54] <guifa> so "return Nil"?  Or should I go with "return Mu" ?  I'm still not quite yet to the point of being able to get things to compile.  Every time I add a new lexical sub three more pop up.  Rakuhydra

[18:58] *** poohman_1 joined
[19:04] <timotimo> i would recommend Mu

[20:11] <sour> hi, I looked at the rakudo star 2020.01 release (https://rakudo.org/post/announce-rakudo-star-release-2020.01), and it linked to a page describing the implemented and WIP features of raku on rakudo, but it had a link that gives 404: https://raku.org/compilers/features . Does anyone know what happened with this?

[20:46] <timotimo> sour: that page was not well maintained, and had both outdated and misleading info

[20:47] <sour> hm, I see, what would be the best sources to look at?
