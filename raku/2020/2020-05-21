[13:25] <rba> melezhik: I have asked Konrad. If you need to test now you might tunnel it through ssh. 

[13:25] <melezhik> rba it should be http ports

[13:25] <melezhik> ahh, I see, I've never done that ... so you mean I could do it on my own?

[13:26] <rba> Yes, but only back to yout machine...

[13:26] <melezhik> yeah

[13:26] <melezhik> is that what you're talking about - https://serverfault.com/questions/78351/can-i-create-ssh-to-tunnel-http-through-server-like-it-was-proxy ?

[13:38] <jdv79> it seems the data marshalling is what kills JsonC.  what would be a better/doable way to do that sort of thing?  do it in nqp?  build it up using the reprs in moarvm?  something else?

[13:48] *** sour left
[13:51] *** stoned75 left
[13:52] <melezhik> rba , so you're suggesting to test web apps using ssh/http tunneling first, over my laptop. and then when it's tested to make ports public?

[13:52] *** stoned75 joined
[13:54] <jdv79> performce of getting from a json string to a raku datastructure

[13:55] <jdv79> JsonC is slower than JSON::Fast which isn't terribly fast

[13:56] <lizmat> jdv79: I assume you're referring to from_json, right ?

[13:56] <jdv79> i think its from-json but yet

[13:56] <jdv79> *yes

[13:57] *** ctilmes joined
[13:57] <jdv79> i have a potential use case where JSON::Fast is the perf bottleneck so i might be able to attempt to make or help make something faster - htat's hte overall situation

[13:59] <ctilmes> jdv79: I've got rudimentary bindings for simdjson.  It's faster than JSON::Fast.  I'm waiting for permission to release.

[14:00] <lizmat> ctilmes: if you're waiting for permission to release, will it also require permission to use simdjson ?

[14:01] <ctilmes> lizmat: simdjson is Apache License 2.0 -- I just need permission to release my raku code

[14:01] <lizmat> ah, from your employer?

[14:01] <ctilmes> yes

[14:01] <lizmat> gotcha

[14:01] <rba> melezhik: As it then works for you only this is usefult to verify the installation and not to make it public available. 

[14:02] <lizmat> at former $work, once the lawyers understood open source, they ok'd it on the provision that $work would *not* be implicated in the code in any way  :-)

[14:03] <lizmat> they were more afraid of liability then of helping the competition 

[14:03] <lizmat> *than

[14:03] <ctilmes> What should I call it?  JSON::simd?

[14:04] <lizmat> JSON::SuperFast  :-)

[14:04] <lizmat> seriously, JSON::simd sounds fine

[14:04] <jdv79> ctilmes: that'd be neat.  how fast is it?  and how is the marshalling handled?

[14:05] <jdv79> i was gonna attempt a bind to ccan-json since its c so its a little easier and its a bit more conformant and fast than JsonC

[14:05] <jdv79> but i might hold off if simd is "on the way";)

[14:06] *** sarna left
[14:06] <ctilmes> jdv79: I've done the marshalling at least 3 different ways so far, but I'm not certain I've hit on the best yet.  It may have tradeoffs that I want to keep multiple ways.

[14:06] <ctilmes> It makes a big difference if you want everything vs. want to pick and choose what you need from JSON.

[14:07] <ctilmes> If you want everything, it is faster to batch up on the C side and send a bunch with a single C  call.

[14:07] <ctilmes> If you are going to pick and choose a few JSON paths, I can leave most of it out, and just send back what you actually need.

[14:11] <jdv79> makes sense.  i would prefer the simpler "from-json" style just for ease of use.

[14:13] *** xinming_ left
[14:13] *** xinming_ joined
[14:14] <ctilmes> It also does some up front work that you can amortize if you re-use the allocated parser.  A single from-json either allocates a new parser with every call (slow), or uses a singleton (not thread-safe for multiple calls), or does some smarter caching of parsers and reuses ones not already in use (harder).

[14:14] <ctilmes> I'm still playing with lots of options trade-offs

[15:04] <Marcool> hi all, how can I tell raku where to find native libs? OpenSSL module is failing with openssl version 1.1, or the stock libressl from apple, but i've managed to get it to work with the openssl 1.0 from homebrew. How can I force that one to be used by NativeCall in the OpenSSL module?

[15:19] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Gnome::Gtk3 (0.28.5) by 03MARTIMM

[15:22] <ctilmes> Marcool: you can put an explicit path in the native() and it will use only that.  You could also try tweaking ENV variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH which governs where it searches.

[15:24] <Marcool> ctilmes: thanks I got the LD_LIBRARY_PATH part from the docs, but can't get it to change anything :/

[15:25] <ctilmes> Of late, I've been using https://github.com/salortiz/NativeLibs to load native libraries

[15:25] <Marcool> but i've actually just modified the code from github.com/sergot/openssl directly to change the native() calls (which to me seem very strange, but that could be me not getting something: https://github.com/sergot/openssl/blob/master/lib/OpenSSL/NativeLib.pm6 ) and it seems to be working

[15:26] <Marcool> why do those subs in there use state $lib = [stuff] and not just return the correct lib string?

[15:27] *** Kaeipi is now known as Kaiepi

[15:27] <ctilmes> To make sure it finds the library at runtime instead of compile time.  If you are on the same system, it won't make a difference, but if you package things up and move them it can matter

[15:28] <Marcool> hum‚Ä¶ right

[20:13] <ctilmes> jdv79: Almost all the time reading JSON is in building the Raku data structures.  with simdjson I can make the parsing itself blazing fast, but to build all the data structures is still slow.
