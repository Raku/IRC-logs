[00:44] <[Coke]> timotimo: I want *diag* output. I don't want the extra stuff that comes with the 'not ok'

[00:44] <[Coke]> so diag? yes. ok(false) telling me the test failed when I already have the 'not ok'? that can go

[00:57] <[Coke]> doesn't look like there's an option in rakudo's lib/Test - both ok and diag use _diag

[01:03] <Skarsnik> having the line of failure is still good, because you don't special number your test in your code

[01:04] <Skarsnik> but good night !

[01:07] <[Coke]> if you don't have loops of tests, it helps, sure

[01:07] <[Coke]> if you have a nested loop with a ok that reports the failure on the same line, it's useless.

[03:31] <sxmx> Does anyone here build rakudo star under OpenBSD? I'm trying to build the latest release

[03:31] <sxmx> OpenBSD 6.8 btw

[03:33] <moon-child> sxmx: works fine for me on freebsd.  Are you encountering any specific difficulties?

[03:37] <sxmx> hold on I'll post a paste

[03:39] <sxmx> https://pastebin.com/RqpYeuVY

[03:39] <sxmx> The raku in the ports for OpenBSD is from 2018, so it may not have worked for a while

[03:42] *** k-man__ is now known as k-man

[03:42] <ape666> I installed raku on OpenBSD 6.8, it was really easy 

[03:44] <ape666> I installed bash, and downloaded the rakudo start bundle

[03:46] <ape666> uncompress the file, then basically you just have to cd into the directory and ./bin/rstart install 

[03:47] <sxmx> I'll give it another shot. I was using zsh as my shell before, but I'll start up a bash shell and see if that changes anything

[03:48] <ape666> it works just by installing it, I'm still using ksh as my default shell

[10:24] <SmokeMachine> m: sub a(|c) { b |c }; sub b(|d) { say d }; a 42, 13, 3.14, :a, :111b

[10:37] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: is `^load` not the correct method for me to use in Red when selecting a row based on email address? `my $subject = User.^load($form.email);` gives me... `message => "invalid input syntax for type integer:...`

[10:40] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: .^load works only for ids. and if you have more than one id/unique you need to name it. Have you tried something like: `my $subject = User.^load(email => $form.email);`?

[10:41] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: so in my schema I also need `has Str $.email is column;` changed to be `is unique`? :)

[10:42] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: if the email should be unique, yes

[10:43] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: if email is not unique, there is no way `.^load` to know what row you want

[10:43] <kawaii> `one of the following keys aren't ids: email` 

[10:43] <kawaii> ah

[10:44] <kawaii> SmokeMachine, this is my User model at the moment https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/FpeHULdC/

[10:45] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: if you want to get any row with that email, you can do something like: `User.^all.first: *.email eq $form.email` or to get all rows with that email: `User.^all.grep: *.email eq $form.email`

[10:45] <kawaii> I mean, there should only ever be one, as constrained by the database :)

[10:48] <SmokeMachine> yes, it seems to be a bug... :(

[10:54] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: I was thinking so, it seems that even `is unique` on the email column didn't prevent me registering another account with the same email 

[10:55] <SmokeMachine> it seems its finding only username is unique

[10:56] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: it seems to be a bug on having more than one unique column. If you make username not unique if sees hat email is unique

[10:58] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: sorry, it's isn't easy enough to fix it now... :(

[10:59] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: no problem :) I will use grep/all.first instead of load until there is a patch 

[11:12] <kawaii> SmokeMachine: not sure if this is another Red bug, but `my $subject = User.^all.first: *.email eq $form.email;` looks like it causes cro to sit there waiting for a request that will never finish

[11:15] <SmokeMachine> kawaii: it seems to be working to me... https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/X5Krp5IQ/
