[08:47] <moon-child> phir1: rename it MyClass.rakumod and then use 'use MyClass', same as in a regular file

[08:54] <phir1> @moon-child Thks moon-child. 

[08:55] <phir1> Here's my Recipes module.

[08:55] <phir1> class Recipes {    method hello() {        say "hello from Recipes!";    }}

[08:55] <phir1> It's called Recipes.rakumod

[08:55] <phir1> Here's my test script called recipes-test.raku :

[08:55] <phir1> use Recipes;#my $r = new Recipes;#$r.hello;

[08:56] <phir1> If I run "raku recipes-test.raku" in the same dir, I get a message stating that Recipes could not be found.

[08:56] *** hungrydonkey left

[08:58] <phir1> works.

[12:36] <Xliff> Question: Why are coercions executed in the dispatch before subsets?

[12:36] <Xliff> m: subset IntegerStr where Int | Str; multi sub a (IntStr $arg) { say 'IntStr' }; multi sub a (Num() $arg) { say 'Num' }; a('Hi'); a(42); a(pi)

[12:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4e21adab9: OUTPUT: ¬´Num‚ê§Num‚ê§Num‚ê§¬ª

[12:36] <Xliff> IntStr is more restrictive than Num(), right?

[12:37] <lizmat> Xliff: not sure, maybe create an issue over it now the new coercion logic is still freshly baked ?

[12:40] <Xliff> lizmat: Sure thing.

[12:41] <Xliff> I think I have the behavior I am expecting spec'd out. Should I include that in the write-up?

[12:41] <Xliff> And I think this might be more dispatch than coercion related.

[12:42] <Xliff> lizmat: On the off chance, do you know where dispatch ordering is handled?

[12:42] <lizmat> not without having to go look for it

[12:44] <nine> patrickb: sure

[12:44] <Xliff> lizmat: Fair enough. Hope it's in one place.

[14:44] <Xliff> How can I lookup all of the methods in a class inheritance tree, particularly methods that have been overloaded.

[14:45] <Xliff> Particularly, how can I call the overloaded method of a superclass?

[14:48] <timotimo> you can go through the .^mro and do .^find_method on all of them for your method name

[14:50] <stoned75> or may be ^methods

[14:50] <Xliff> Ah. I was hoping that was not the case.

[14:51] <timotimo> what does .^can and .^cando return?

[14:51] <Xliff> .^can only returns 1 method

[14:53] <Xliff> LOL! I forgot the inheritance tree.

[14:53] <Xliff> Now .^can returns the proper number of elements.

[14:55] <Xliff> self.<superclass name>::method

[14:56] <timotimo> yeah, if you have the class name as a literal in your code

[14:57] <timotimo> but there's also a self.invoke:<::> or something that does this

[15:00] <Xliff> OK. How would that work?

[15:00] <Xliff> I can also do self.^mro[1].?<methodname>

[15:01] <Xliff> I'm thinking method SUPER { self.^mro.grep( .HOW ~~ ClassHow )[1] }

[15:01] <Xliff> Err...

[15:01] <Xliff> I'm thinking method SUPER { self.^mro.grep( .HOW ~~ ClassHOW )[1] }

[18:54] <guifa> the time puns are going to be awful this year

[18:54] * guifa is writing his on time too

[18:54] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Gnome::N (0.18.1.2) by 03MARTIMM

[18:54] <JJAtria[m]> I can never have enough puns. Gimme moar!

[18:55] <guifa> mine are more‚Ä¶. references.  I think all but one of my section titles are doctor who refs

[18:55] <JJAtria[m]> guifa: I hope we don't overlap? I sort of changed the topic of mine at the last minute :/ 

[18:55] <guifa> No, not at all

[18:55] <guifa> Mine is on adding timezone support to DateTime

[18:55] <JJAtria[m]> Nice. I'm glad I remove my "Raku is an inverse TARDIS" comment then :) 

[18:55] <guifa> haha no

[18:55] <guifa> keep it

[18:56] <guifa> but yeah, I‚Äôm basically showing off how to extend a built in class with global (and retroactive!) effect

[18:58] <JJAtria[m]> Ooh, interesting. Sounds like the kind of scissors you shouldn't run with

[18:58] * lizmat wonders whether JJAtria[m] has seen https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4060

[18:59] <jmerelo> JJAtria[m]: I'm on it.

[19:01] <JJAtria[m]> lizmat: Oh, interesting. I hadn't seen it, but I think I had seen a related commit recently maybe?

[19:01] <guifa> I can‚Äôt imagine many other use cases except for mucking with DateTime and Date which were given inherent limitationsm to a Gregorian and non-daylight-time-based calendar system in the interest of not needing to update Raku every few weeks

[19:01] <JJAtria[m]> I wonder whether this will mean my code becomes simpler or obsolete :P 

[19:01] <lizmat> JJAtria[m]: the related commit was increasing the sensitivity of Supply.batch(:seconds) to milliseconds instead of seconds

[19:02] <lizmat> I'm not sure... but the journey is always interesting and educational ?

[19:03] <JJAtria[m]> lizmat: Oh, for sure. I think writing that module taught me a lot about some of these types (which is what I close that post with)

[19:05] <guifa> JJAtria[m]: I always feel after each new module that I write that I learn something that could vastly improve several other modules that I‚Äôve written

[21:03] <moritz> ohm, does anybdoy know how to get back to the classic wordpress editor?

[21:03] <leont> Need some opinions on Getopt::Long error message: "No argument given for option foo" or "No argument given for option --foo"

[21:04] <moritz> the latter

[21:07] <perryprog> The latter

[21:08] <perryprog> Another alternative could be "The argument --foo requires a value but none was specified", stealing from Rust

[21:08] <moritz> that would be even clearer, yes

[21:09] <guifa> ++ for the rust one

[21:09] <guifa> Technically ‚Äîfoo is the option, you just haven‚Äôt provided a value to go along with it

[21:09] <guifa> err

[21:09] <guifa> ‚Äîfoo is the argument, I mean

[21:11] <perryprog> As far as I know, I don't think there's any rigorous terminology for each portion of a long flag.

[21:24] <moritz> option sounds righter
