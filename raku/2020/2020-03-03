[12:15] <Altreus> (it's not documented in https://docs.raku.org/language/operators)

[12:16] <Altreus> (But combined operators might be but I couldn't find that quickly)

[12:16] <nine> it is

[12:26] <lizmat> ooc

[12:36] *** Itaipu left
[12:51] <Altreus> I put #TODO and then gave the stuff a defined value

[12:51] <Altreus> i.e. True

[13:00] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[13:00] <Altreus> Why does True have a capital letter and therefore looks like a type object instead of a value?

[13:01] <Altreus> Are there any other built-in defined values that look like type objects? Besides False

[13:01] *** Doc_Holliwould left
[13:01] <Altai-man_> Altreus, isn't because it is an enum value?

[13:02] <Altreus> Just seems everything else with a capital letter is undefined

[13:02] <Altreus> I don't think enum values necessarily demand a capital letter do they?

[13:02] <Altreus> Seems like a constant to me, so it should really be TRUE

[13:02] <Altai-man_> Not like they demand one, but it is a style preference.

[13:03] *** Doc_Holliwould joined
[13:03] <Altai-man_> I honestly feel we have lots of other issues compared to True being not TRUE or true. `true` subjectively reads worse to me and stands out less than `True`, `TRUE` is just bad.

[13:03] *** holli left
[13:04] <Altreus> Yeah ... just crossed my mind is all

[13:04] <Altreus> Cos I replaced True with Any

[13:04] <Altai-man_> Maybe there are deeper reasons, though.

[13:04] <Altreus> And went, hang on
