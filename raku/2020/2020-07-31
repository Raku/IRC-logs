[11:16] <demostanis> Hello everyone! I'm having yet another issue with regexes, I wonder if I'll ever get good at it one day... With codesection's help yesterday I've learned about the `<(...)>` thing which allows me to capture only what I need in regex... Though, I have the following case: `"AABBCC  DDDD  AABBCC" ~~  / [ [ AABBCC | DDDD ] \s* ]* /` this matches the entire string. Now I'd want only to have the AABBCC, not the DDDD.

[11:16] <demostanis> So I do that: `"AABBCC  DDDD  AABBCC" ~~  / [ <([ AABBCC)> | DDDD ] \s* ]* /`, but it will only match the first AABBCC (I think it's not considering the * quantifier) What should I do? Thanks...

[11:38] <Altai-man_> demostanis, hi! Can you please specify the rules? Are `DDDD` delimiters? What is the task here?

[11:39] <moritz> demostanis: I don't think <( and )> can really ever work the way you want them to work

[11:39] <moritz> they are markers "the match starts here" and "the match ends here", but you cannot use them to chop up a string to match, not match, and then match again

[11:40] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Discogs::API (0.0.1) by 03ELIZABETH

[11:43] <El_Che> the ecosystem grant request is strange. TPF support would suggest approval of a very specific implementation

[11:43] <El_Che> is it just me?

[11:45] <Altai-man_> El_Che, well... It is undeniable the current ecosystem options have their own flaws. At the same time, there is no Raku solution around and it is a great time to get one. The cost is high IMO, but that is living level difference, US is expensive, I imagine. Other than that it seems sane to me.

[11:47] <Altai-man_> I have what I'd call "not the best" experience with CPAN and I am tired to be annoyed with the "fixes were commited but version in zef cache still fails to install, nuke it" thing.

[11:48] <Altai-man_> Also, isn't TPF rakudo grants support a very specific implementation?

[11:48] <El_Che> yes, all the options are terrible in my opinion, including the grant request one

[11:50] <Altai-man_> El_Che, it's time to discuss what can be done better then?

[11:50] <El_Che> personally I would copy the go way

[11:50] <El_Che> ( and I want to have a look at what activestate is doing with their new pkg manager)

[11:50] <Altai-man_> `import github/foo`?

[11:51] <El_Che> mostly the git tag based import, not the syntax

[11:51] <El_Che> it can be a line in meta6

[11:52] <Altai-man_> I imagine this can be discussed given the grant author is willing to cooperate.

[11:52] *** reach_satori_ left
[11:52] <El_Che> my point is is that it may be too early to pin an specific implementation

[11:52] *** reach_satori_ joined
[11:52] <El_Che> maybe other languages have also good idea's

[11:53] <gfldex> Is there a way to tell if a IO::Handle was opened for writing?

[11:53] <El_Che> but replicating CPAN/python/npm sound like copying the worst of those languages

[11:54] <El_Che> that's why often people *hate* deploying projects in those languages

[11:54] *** JJMerelo joined
[11:54] <El_Che> if the ecosystem is fragile, vendoring (keeping deps in the project) repo is a huge win

[11:55] <demostanis> moritz: How would I do?

[11:56] <Altai-man_> demostanis, what are you trying to do?

[12:00] <demostanis> Matching an .ini file with multi-line support using \, with moritz's recommendations, my code matches a single value using `token value { [ <normal-value>+ | <backslash> | <.newline> ]* }`, a normal-value matches anything but comments, new lines and backslashes, a new line matches a new line preceded by a backslash, and backslash matches a \ before \S

[12:00] <demostanis> I would want to get normal-value and backslash as a string

[12:04] <Altai-man_> demostanis, if you want to disregard backslashes / newlines-spaces, make tokens you care about named ones and process then in actions class afterwards.

[12:04] <Altai-man_> Or set the thing you want to be positional capture and handle it.

[12:04] <Altai-man_> m: say ("AABBCC  DDDD  AABBCC" ~~  / [ [ (AABBCC) | DDDD ] \s* ]* /)[0]

[12:05] <Altai-man_> ^ is this what you want?

[12:07] <demostanis> God damn. It was that easy. It solved my problem, thank you so much. I feel stupid now

[12:07] <Altai-man_> No need to, it is tricky when you start.

[12:09] <demostanis> Another, unrelated, question, what's dist.ini file and what manages it? I get no results when I search on docs.raku.org

[12:10] <Altai-man_> I believe this file is used by CPAN and some people are uploading Raku modules there, so it is not Raku specific.

[12:10] <Altai-man_> And it is not necessary to distribute a module.

[12:10] <demostanis> Oh ok, thanks

[12:17] <JJMerelo> Hey

[12:18] <JJMerelo> Tomorrow the 20th aniversary calendar starts... And we still need lots of articles. 

[12:18] <Altai-man_> JJMerelo, do we need 20 articles or?

[12:18] <JJMerelo> We're looking at short papers that dissect one of the original RFCs and relate them to current Raku stuff https://github.com/Raku/advent/tree/master/20th

[12:19] <JJMerelo> Altai-man_ right

[12:19] <Altai-man_> I see.

[12:19] <JJMerelo> So, 13 to go.

[12:21] <El_Che> JJMerelo: to late now, but I think that stressing that Perl6 is 20y old kind of clashes with the "new" exciting raku lang narrative :)

[12:21] <JJMerelo> Python is even older, but it's still marketed as exiciting and up-and-coming

[12:22] <JJMerelo> El_Che I also need _you_ to write something :-)

[12:22] <JJMerelo> And it's not the language, but the inception. 

[12:23] <JJMerelo> The way it was designed is pretty unique, and I think we need to stress that, as well as honor and appreciate the people who created those first RFCs in the summer of 2000

[12:23] <El_Che> I get the motivation

[12:23] <JJMerelo> They could have been surfing the dot-com bubble, but they were spending the time doing that. So kudos.

[12:23] <El_Che> I am just pointing out the mixed signals

[12:24] <El_Che> with perl 7 coming (or not) there is need to create as much distance as possible

[12:25] <Altai-man_> True. But more stuff on the net is a cool thing. Including `Raku programming language` there helps e.g. TIOBE and SEO in general.

[12:26] <JJMerelo> perl 7 is coming, there's no doubt about that

[12:26] <El_Che> is it

[12:26] <JJMerelo> I mean, not my fight or mine to say. 

[12:27] <JJMerelo> What's mine to say is : we''ve decided to get ahead with this celebration, and we're gonna do it.

[12:27] <JJMerelo> Wanna help, that's fine. 

[12:27] <El_Che> Reading the mailinglist I feel they are in a python2->3+perl5->6 road

[12:28] <JJMerelo> Don't wanna help but talk about mixed signals, that's fine too. But I don't know sh*t about marketing or, for that matter, signals beyond kill -KILL. I know about celebrating a process, the people, and what brought us here.

[12:28] <JJMerelo> Which is what I'm trying to do.

[12:28] <lizmat> I've unsubscribed from *all* Perl mailinglists, I feel much better now

[12:29] <lizmat> the elephant has left the room, and everybody is staring at each other

[12:29] <leont> It is my problem, and I really wish it wasn't :-/

[12:29] <El_Che> lizmat was the unifying factor

[15:57] <[ptc]> moritz: oh dear, I'm becoming so German.  I read the end of your question as "112 Postleitzahl"!

[16:01] <demostanis> Is there a way to improve this piece of code (to make it not repetitive):

[16:02] <demostanis> $!thing = %hash{'thing'};

[16:02] <demostanis> $!other-thing = %hash{'other-thing'};

[16:04] *** andrzejku left
[16:08] <gfldex> demostanis: heavily depends on the context

[16:08] <demostanis> The code is inside a the submethod BUILD of a normal class

[16:30] <gfldex> demostanis: https://gist.github.com/f577d9816af2b6b2dc2e84e92a3ace10

[16:30] <gfldex> so the answer is yes bug slow

[16:31] <gfldex> s/bug/but/

[16:32] <gfldex> also, you may want to ask that question again when we got proper macros

[16:32] <Altai-man_> Hmm...

[16:33] <Altai-man_> There is a much easier solution, no?

[16:33] <rypervenche> Couldn't you also do something like: ($!thing, $!other-thing) = %hash{'thing', 'other-thing'};

[16:33] <Altai-man_> m: class C { has $.foo; has $.bar; method BUILD(:$!foo, :$!bar) {} }; my %h = foo => 42, bar => 100; say C.new(|%h)

[16:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17f7f156a: OUTPUT: ¬´C.new(foo => 42, bar => 100)‚ê§¬ª

[16:33] <rypervenche> That wouldn't scale, and I'd rather have separate lines for better readability, but yeah.

[16:35] <demostanis> This works, thanks. What do you mean by proper macros?

[16:36] *** zacts joined
[16:37] <demostanis> Also rypervenche and Altai-man_ solutions won't work in my case as the hash is created depending on an argument passed to the submethod BUILD.

[16:37] <gfldex> there is currently work done to rewrite AST handling in Rakudo. That is likely going to get us hygenic macros that actually work.
