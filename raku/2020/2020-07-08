[01:39] <japhb> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { <foo> }; token foo { <bar> }; token bar { a <( b )> c }; }; Foo.parse('abc');

[01:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: ( no output )

[01:39] <japhb> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { <foo> }; token foo { <bar> }; token bar { a <( b )> c }; }; Foo.parse('abc').say;

[01:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§ foo => ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§  bar => ÔΩ¢bÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[01:40] <japhb> Given the above ^^, how would one make the matches for foo and TOP be the same as bar (that is to say, 'b' instead of 'abc')?

[01:41] <Xliff> japhb: But that's not what you are asking for in the grammar.

[01:42] <Xliff> To do what you want, you'd have to mangle foo to return bar[0]

[01:43] <Xliff> japhb: Is there a reason, you can't use $/<bar>?

[01:46] <japhb> Xliff: This is cut down from a larger example, but in the real grammar token bar can actually be several different things, some of which need <( )> and some don't.  So I want to get whatever bar claims is its match when I use it in token foo.

[01:47] <japhb> Basically I want to be able to refactor and change <bar> and have the decision made locally in token bar decide what higher-level tokens think is its match.

[01:48] <Xliff> Ah. A bit above my experience level, I'm afraid.

[02:12] <[Coke]> ^^ I think the extra $<bar> there *should* work, doesn't, but I don't know why. :(

[02:15] <guifa2> [Coke]: Are you wanting it to actually fail on 'abc' but match correctly on 'abcb'?

[02:15] *** hungryd10 left
[02:16] <[Coke]> I don't want anything. :)

[02:16] <guifa2> The $<bar> works just fine for me, but it's in a plain code block so doesn't actually affect anything

[02:16] <[Coke]> was just trying to get it to return bar's match for foo

[02:16] <guifa2> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { <foo> }; token foo { <bar> { $<bar>.say } }; token bar { a <( b )> c }; }; Foo.parse('abc').say

[02:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢bÔΩ£‚ê§ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§ foo => ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§  bar => ÔΩ¢bÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[02:18] <guifa2> Ah, I think I understand.  You'd like $<foo> to be equivalent to $<bar>, that is, "b" alone?

[02:18] <[Coke]> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { <foo> }; token foo { <bar> }; token bar { a <( b )> c }; }; class Foo-A { method foo($/) { make $/<bar>[0]} }; say Foo.parse('abc', actions=>Foo-A);

[02:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§ foo => ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§  bar => ÔΩ¢bÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[02:19] <[Coke]> (that's what I started with, was trying to simplify incorrectly)

[02:20] <guifa2> How about doing this?  Not sure if it's what you're aiming for

[02:20] <guifa2> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { $<foo>=<.bar> }; token bar { a <( b )> c };  };  Foo.parse('abc').say;

[02:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢abcÔΩ£‚ê§ foo => ÔΩ¢bÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[02:22] <[Coke]> also: you could be using a named capture inside bar

[16:56] <SpaceOpera> Hello, I am trying to install the latest Rakudo Star bundle on Ubuntu linux 18.04. But the installation instructions produce this error: "rakudo-star-*.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory" on the second step (curl command). Any suggestions?

[16:59] <jdv79> where is second step exactly?

[17:00] <SpaceOpera> Here: https://rakudo.org/star/source under Build for Linux/MacOS

[17:01] <eery> Yeah that link is broken, https://rakudo.org/latest/star/src points to a 404

[17:03] <eery> try "wget https://github.com/rakudo/star/archive/2020.02-rc1.tar.gz"

[17:03] <jdv79> that's a bit old

[17:04] <eery> newest release on github's release tab

[17:04] <[Coke]> I never did understand why people built R-Star from source.

[17:05] *** JJMerelo left
[17:05] <[Coke]> (as opposed to building rakudo-latest release)

[17:06] <jdv79> SpaceOpera: do you need star?  you could just install rakudo and zef off master

[17:06] <[Coke]> https://rakudo.org/star/source - those accordions seem *very* slow here. just me?

[17:06] <[Coke]> s/master/latest release/ even.

[17:07] *** guifa2 joined
[17:08] <SpaceOpera> Okay, then. It's not me being unable to follow the instructions. I will try installing the binary release from the downloads page. Thanks.

[17:28] <[Coke]> ... keep in mind that the front page shows an old version!

[17:28] <[Coke]> make sure you click through to "older releases" and get the *newer* release.

[17:28] <[Coke]> also: who maintains the rakudo site? Can we get this fixed?

[20:27] <petrprog> Hi all) Is Rakudo ready for production?

[20:27] <petrprog> Raku

[20:27] <jdv79> yes, no, maybe so...

[20:27] <jdv79> "depends"

[20:28] <jdv79> it is used in production if that helps

[20:28] *** Tirifto joined
[20:29] <petrprog> Where Raku used for?

[20:30] <petrprog> Can i use it for web Android desktop development?

[20:31] <lizmat> probably not

[20:32] <petrprog> I always was big fan of Perl, but Raku...

[20:33] <lizmat> well, you can use Raku well for most things you used to use Perl for

[20:33] <jdoege> Can someone knowledgeable comment on the intent and the reality of Rakudo Star releases? What is available for download seems out of sync with what is current.

[20:34] <petrprog> Thanks for answers))

[20:35] *** guifa2 left
[20:35] <lizmat> jdoege: it's complicated

[20:36] <lizmat> the person who did the rakudo * releases in the way past, does not want to be involved anymore

[20:36] <sena_kun> petrprog, in real life you get the compiler, zef and enjoy.

[20:36] <lizmat> Patrick Spek decided to pick it up, and re-create the workflow of Rakudo Star which was broken after an extensive refactor of the build logic of Raku

[20:37] <lizmat> he's made Rakudo Star available as a personal project

[20:37] <lizmat> now the discussion / decision to be made is really: is Rakudo Star a core thing?  Or is it a personal thing

[20:37] *** stoned75 left
[20:38] <jdoege> I saw that but it is only available for Linux, sadly. I use a mac as my primary environment.

[20:38] <lizmat> and updating websites and links is falling through the cracks at this point

[20:38] <lizmat> well, I don't think Patrick has access to a Mac system

[20:38] <jdoege> Oh, it should def be a core thing. It is crucial to the success of Raku that there be an easy way for someone to get started.

[20:39] *** petrprog left
[20:40] <jdoege> The only link on the website to download points to Rakudo Star which is now out of date. Without it or something equivalent, how would someone reasonably use the language?

[20:40] *** wamba left
[20:40] <rypervenche> Well, you can install the compiler, which IS up-to-date and then use zef to install any modules that you need/want.

[20:41] <jdoege> I think the compiler is source only, no?

[20:42] <SmokeMachine> Hi again! I've started writing the Red Cook Book on it's documentation. Would someone like to take a look at it, please? https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/docs/tutorials/cookbook.md

[20:43] <jdoege> Compiling from source is non-trivial for Mac and PC.

[20:43] *** xinming left
[20:43] <lizmat> because on Mac you need XCode ?

[20:44] <jdoege> For one, yeah.

[20:44] *** stoned75 joined
[20:44] <lizmat> guess I've always had that, not realizing it is not default

[20:44] *** xinming joined
[20:45] <jdoege> I am, at this point, not talking about me but about the success of Raku at large. requiring compilation from source would be a fairly significant barrier to Mac and PC users.

[20:46] <jdoege> Most people using scripting languages, I would wager, aren't steeped in build processes.

[20:47] <rypervenche> jdoege: The download files on rakudo.org are all pre-compiled and have binaries.

[20:47] <ShimmerFairy> Rakudo Star's offering is to come with the batteries included, not that it comes compiled.

[20:48] *** lichtkind left
[20:48] <jdoege> @rypervencche: they appear to be 2020.01 which is a bit behind current.

[20:49] <jdoege> ShimmerFairy: fine to say, but until lately, that is how they have come and it is a significant benefit to new users.

[20:50] <codesections> To provide a bit of a counterpoint: I have started writing Raku fairly recently (past couple of weeks) and found the installation process pretty smooth

[20:50] <ShimmerFairy> Yeah, my conception of Rakudo Star's purpose may be out of date.

[20:51] *** ca53 left
[20:51] <jdoege> To be sure, installing Raku from Rakudo Star 2020.01 is very smooth. It is just out of date and looks like it will not be brought up to date. Going forward that appears to be a bit of a problem for some new adopters.

[20:52] <lizmat> agree that it is a problem

[20:52] <codesections> I first installed via my distro's package manager without any issues (just to test it out in the easiest way possible).  After I decided I wanted to explore more seriously, I installed Rakudo Star, again without issues (I think I ran into a couple of broken links, but an different link in related docs).  That got me a much newer version than the one my distro had ‚Äì from sometime this year, even

[20:52] <lizmat> one that should be solved for 2020.07 (hopefully)

[20:52] *** lichtkind joined
[20:53] <codesections> and I later (just recently) installed from source to run some performace tests (since I'd read that startup times were improving)

[20:54] <codesections> None of that is to say it shouldn't be a lot better.  Speaking as a new user, I agree that onboarding new folks is great :D

[20:55] <codesections> Maybe the difference in my perspective is that it's hard for me to feel like 2020.01 is old; compared to most languages, that seems like a pretty recent release 

[20:55] <jdoege> I apologize if this sounds like complaining. I know and thoroughly appreciate this is a volunteer effort. This is more about a deep desire to see Raku become a broadly accepted language.

[20:56] <jdoege> And a bit of a selfish desire to enjoy some of the improvements being made.

[20:56] <jdoege> :-D

[20:56] <rypervenche> jdoege: Perhaps I'm looking at something different from you, but they're all 2020.06-01 for me.

[20:57] <jdoege> https://raku.org/downloads/

[20:57] <rypervenche> jdoege: I'm talking about the tarballs/zip files of the binaries, not the installable file. Which I would agree, would be useful for those who use those OSes.

[20:57] <jdoege> https://rakudo.org/star/

[20:57] *** squashable6 left
[20:57] <jdoege> Even the Raku website says 2020.01

[20:57] *** squashable6 joined
[20:58] <jdoege> It's only because I follow a lot of Raku news that I am aware of more recent versions.

[21:02] <jdoege> rypervenche: I see what you are referring to. If that's how things will be done, it will be best to update raku.org to point to that part of the rakudo website and have some instruction on how to procede.

[21:03] <jdoege> Thanks to everyone for the answers and clarification.

[21:43] <tinita> rypervenche: the number can be on the - line, but does not have to

[21:43] <rypervenche> tinita: Yeah, I'm reading through the YAML spec now. It seems my way of doing it is the compact version.

[21:43] <tinita> but it would be the recommended form, and libyaml also puts it on the same line

[21:44] <tinita> rypervenche: may I also suggest https://www.yaml.info/ ? it's in progress, but if you have time, I'm glad for feedback

[21:45] <tinita> https://www.yaml.info/learn/bestpractices.html - There is an example under "Formatting"

[21:50] *** rindolf left
[21:50] <rypervenche> Thanks. I never knew about some of compact forms. :)

[21:53] <lizmat> tinita++   # just in general also  :-)

[21:56] <tinita> blush

[21:56] <tinita> lizmat++ =)

[21:57] <rypervenche> I'm going to see if I have enough Raku knowledge to add a :compact option to YAMLish. I doubt it, but who knows...

[21:59] <lizmat> ++rypervenche 

[21:59] <codesections> Is there a philosophical/design reason that Raku makes it much more verbose to work with Maps than hashes?  In other words, Hoffman codding suggests Raku "wants" me to be using the mutable data structure, which feels like an odd fit with how much Raku otherwise supports functional programming.  Am I missing something?

[22:02] <lizmat> codesections 

[22:02] <lizmat> are you aware you can say:

[22:02] *** Altai-man_ joined

[22:08] <codesections> Thanks, that's good to know.  I'm slightly confused by the sigils, though: when I created a map with Map.new and a % sigil, I just got a hash.  So why does the % sigil work in `my %h is Map`?

[22:08] <codesections> m: my %map = Map.new('a', 42); %map<a> = "This works"; say %map.WHAT   

[22:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16d24a212: OUTPUT: ¬´(Hash)‚ê§¬ª

[22:09] <timotimo> assigning to a % or @ sigiled variable is "list-assignment"-[ike

[22:09] <timotimo> which iterates the right-hand side into the left-hand container

[22:09] <timotimo> the default container for "my %map" is Hash, but if you "is Map" it, it will be Map instead

[22:09] <codesections> my %map is Map = a => 42; %map<a> = "This doesn't work"; 

[22:09] *** aborazmeh left
[22:15] <codesections> timotimo: thanks.  I'm not *sure* I fully have my head around that yet¬†‚Äì but I probably just need to spend a bit more time with the container docs.  In the meantime, is it better to use $ or % for maps?

[22:15] <codesections> The Map docs use $, but it looks like the `is Map` shortcut won't work with those‚Ä¶?

[22:16] <timotimo> one difference worth considering is that a $ variable will not be iterated over, because $ is for "items"

[22:16] <timotimo> m: my $foo = { a => 1, b => 2 }; my %foo = a => 1, b => 2; for $foo { say "$_ is in foo" }; for %foo { say "$_ is in percent foo" }
