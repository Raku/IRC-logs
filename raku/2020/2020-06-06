[16:46] <MasterDuke> timotimo: do i have to have exactly the same binary for a core file to be useful?

[16:47] <timotimo> well, if the addresses inside the binary don't match up, you'll be in trouble :)

[16:47] <timotimo> not sure how exact "reproducible builds" works with this

[16:47] <timotimo> but i imagine turning debug symbols on vs off and compiling should give at least a really similar binary except for the presence of a debug symbol section near the end?

[16:48] <timotimo> there's also a "split debug symbols into extra file" faeture that you could investigate

[16:48] <timotimo> BBL

[16:49] <MasterDuke> we both are using arch, so so the binary should pretty similar...but i think i may have changed to use -march=native recently

[16:49] <MasterDuke> guess that may change things

[17:01] <MasterDuke> i have to go afk for a bit, but timotimo is the author of moarperf and also knows gdb better than i do. i recommend giving him a ping when he's back

[17:01] <Manifest0> oh! nope. That's my script. Do you need it? 

[17:02] <MasterDuke> ah. would be helpful, and the input if possible, since i'm not getting much out of the core file

[17:02] <MasterDuke> but any more work will probably have to wait until after dinner on my end

[17:37] <suman> For functions with int as argument in C function what should I use in raku? There are so many int types in raku

[17:37] <suman> int 8 int16 int32 int64

[17:37] *** brtastic left
[17:38] <suman> Example consider this C function 

[17:38] <suman> double	dnorm(double, double, double, int);

[17:38] *** sena_kun left
[17:40] <Manifest0> "int" is at least int16 (according to wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types )

[21:43] <SmokeMachine> how can I run a specific test on comma?

[21:45] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: That's not a way to do that yet.

[21:45] <SmokeMachine> ok, thanks

[21:45] <jnthn> Uh, well, that's not quite true: you can set it up to run as a normal script, of course

[21:45] <jnthn> But you don't get the results display

[21:46] <SmokeMachine> yes... 

[21:46] * jnthn makes sure we have an issue filed to implement that

[21:47] <SmokeMachine> I was expecting something like this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/QuKQbdT8/image.png

[21:48] <jnthn> Probably has to be at the level of a particular .t file

[21:49] <SmokeMachine> yes

[21:49] <jnthn> But that can certainly be done

[21:49] <timotimo> unless we have support for a testing framework that does support selecting tests to be run

[21:50] <timotimo> tap. benefit: pretty simple, in theory. drawback: pretty simple

[21:51] <jnthn> The other thing that's really annoying to wire up at the moment is test times. We did try with the timing env-var in Test.pm I think it ended up almost impossible to work with the output.
