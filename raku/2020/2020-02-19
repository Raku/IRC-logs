[00:59] <rypervenche> Is it possible to pull two values out of a hash at once? I'm currently pulling one out with: @data¬ª<date> . Is there some way to do this without needing to use @data twice?

[01:00] <rypervenche> oh

[01:00] <rypervenche> I just figured it out. Just do @data¬ª<date day-of-week>

[01:57] <rypervenche> No, I think it's normal. I'm doing this from an array of hashes.

[01:57] <rypervenche> I guess I'll have to do something like two for loops to change the inner arrays into strings.

[02:05] <guifa> Don‚Äôt forget about the hyper operator, it can be useful at times for that

[17:59] <Voldenet> that looks a lot better, thanks

[18:00] <lizmat> that would also eat additional positionals, which you probably don't want ?

[18:02] <Voldenet> I don't mind - all subs take named arguments

[23:27] <[Coke]> I've been happy with macports, if you want a second opinion.

[23:28] <[Coke]> but I know many folks who are happy homebrew users (including many p5ers)

[23:48] <cfa> fwiw, i also like macports but have nothing against homebrew

[23:49] <cfa> also, afternoon all

[23:51] <tbrowder> supposedly with homebrew i can get the gnu tools with same behavior as on linux as opposed to rhe bsd-like in normal osx

[23:52] <cfa> tbrowder: coretools, gmake etc?

[23:52] <tbrowder> that's what i think they advertise

[23:54] <tbrowder> i'll check more closely. i got the advert for them when i was looking foe emacs on mac...

[23:55] <tbrowder> my son is giving me an old mac mini i plan to use with a large screen tv, and do a little rakuing with it on the side ;-)

[23:56] <vrurg> tbrowder: if memory serves me right, homebrew has much lesser number of ports.

[23:57] <tbrowder> ah, that may be a deal breaker...

[23:57] <cfa> the supposed advantage of homebrew over macports is that it leverages a lot of system-installed libraries

[23:57] <cfa> whereas macports tends to build its own, which in some cases are duplicates

[23:57] <cfa> the advantage is that everything is consistent and sandboxed

[23:59] <tbrowder> ok, thnx, i guess it will be a new learning experience. so macports are from bsd people?
