[16:16] <tellable6> 2020-11-05T16:00:34Z #raku <lizmat> melezhik: am aware of the issue, I can *not* reproduce this locally  :-(

[16:16] <tellable6> 2020-11-06T21:15:34Z #raku-dev <patrickb> melezhik: I think tyil already has a lead on what might have been wrong. In fact I managed to test the module successfully as well after manually installing its dependencies.

[16:29] <melezhik> tyil you're right, it accessible on https though - https://rakudist.raku.org/sparky/builds , do it need the redirection?

[16:30] <tyil> I would generally recommend it, otherwise people may get security warnings instead of the page

[16:30] <melezhik> I will take a look later, should be an easy configuration fix
