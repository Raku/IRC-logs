[00:28] <rypervenche> How could I go about making this hyperthreaded? I've seen jnthn's video where he does something similar, but he did it with Proc::Async, and this isn't a Proc and I'm unsure how to speed up my program: https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/21d5dcc3ce588f309871c374ac6dc4a5

[00:29] *** xelxebar joined
[00:32] <thundergnat> rypervenche, Where is data coming from? In general, you can't .push onto an array in a hyperthreaded routine

[00:33] <thundergnat> If you know how large data is though, you can cycle through the array indicies and modify them in a hyper. 

[00:37] *** Kaiepi left

[00:38] <rypervenche> thundergnat: It's a 162138 line file.

[00:38] <rypervenche> I can post the whole script (what I have of it, it's not done yet) if that would make things clearer.

[00:38] <thundergnat> Could you try something like :  https://gist.github.com/thundergnat/c8902a82f2a48db2b7fcb7e5a511ecc1

[00:39] <thundergnat> or maybe even .race instead of .hyper

[00:41] <thundergnat> You would probably need to have all of the @data loaded into memory at once to effectively hyper it

[00:41] <rypervenche> I'm slurping it at the beginning of my script, so that's doable.

[00:41] <rypervenche> https://gist.github.com/rypervenche/66f0f4c39e9e77b4bc438fb43bf6d388

[00:42] <rypervenche> I'll give what you wrote a shot.

[00:43] <thundergnat> What I suggested should be doable as far as hyperthreading; I can't speak to how effective your parsing will be without a lot of study.

[00:45] *** guifa2 left
[00:45] <thundergnat> You basically can't expect to be able to modify an array (or hash) in a hyperthread without problems, but if you predeclare the size of the receiving array, you don't need to worry about autovivification

[00:46] <thundergnat> You can modify the contents of each "slot" but can't reliably add or remove them in a hyperthread.

[00:47] <rypervenche> That makes sense.

[00:48] <thundergnat> It may be worthwhile (or necessary) to just have a line like: @objects[162140] = ''; to "presize" the array

[00:48] <rypervenche> Ok, I'll test out the speeds of those.

[00:49] <rypervenche> It's definitely using all threads now, haha. Had to use @data[$_] instead of $_ and that did it.

[00:49] <thundergnat> Cool. Hope it makes a difference for you

[00:50] <rypervenche> Huh... MoarVM panic: Internal error: zeroed target thread ID in work pass

[00:51] <thundergnat> Yeah, that's a common error for thread contention

[00:51] <thundergnat> The array presize trick I mentioned above might help

[00:52] *** upupbb-user2 left
[00:53] <rypervenche> Wouldn't I need 162137 since I'll have 162138 elements?

[00:54] <thundergnat> I just added a few extra "empty" slots, yeah if you want an exact number, 162137 is probably right

[00:55] <rypervenche> Ah yes, my .made didn't work on the Anys :P

[00:56] *** mniip_ joined
[00:56] <thundergnat> Grammars are tricky until you get the hang of them (and even than...)

[00:56] <thundergnat> *then

[00:57] <thundergnat> But they are so cool

[00:57] <rypervenche> Yeah, I thought I had to have a big file with tons of lines. Didn't think that passing it line by line would be better.

[00:57] <rypervenche> I mean, I had only seen examples of full files, so yeah.

[00:59] <thundergnat> Anyway, good luck with it, I'm going to need to go afk.

[18:33] <chloekek> What are examples of algorithms that need it?

[18:36] <ryn1x> in 2020.01 i am getting a new warning at runtime about "Calling '.contains' on a List, did you mean 'needle (elem) list'?". The code is similar to `<1 2 3>.contains(1)`. The REPL on 2020.01 does not throw the same warning...

[18:37] <sena_kun> m: <1 2 3>.contains(1)

[18:37] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´Calling '.contains' on a List, did you mean 'needle (elem) list'?‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/oF8uJr5gQ7 line 1‚ê§¬ª

[18:37] <sena_kun> ryn1x, are you using rakudo star? 2020.02 has the warning in REPL as well.

[18:37] <ryn1x> yeah it is rakudo star

[18:38] <sena_kun> ryn1x, next rakudo star release will include it then, I think. Thanks for reporting!

[18:39] <ryn1x> the code still seems to behave correctly but the warning prints out in the middles of a tui menu... not sure what to change to get rid of of the warning

[18:40] <ryn1x> the code was written on with an older compiler but I had to install the application on a newer computer and just downloaded the latest rakudo star to set everything up

[18:40] <sena_kun> m: say 2 (elem) <1 2 3>;

[18:40] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[18:40] <ryn1x> ah ok.. that is easy

[18:40] <sena_kun> considering `<1 2 3>` are strings, you want

[18:40] <sena_kun> m: say '2' (elem) <1 2 3>;

[18:40] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[18:41] <sena_kun> m: say <2> (elem) <1 2 3>;

[18:41] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[18:41] <sena_kun> this one

[18:41] <ryn1x> yeah... there we go... i need strings

[18:41] *** melezhik left
[18:42] <ryn1x> any reason the .contains version I had previously is now throws that warning?

[18:42] <sena_kun> bisectable6, say "2" (elem) <1 2 3>;

[18:42] <bisectable6> sena_kun, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=13ca677) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[18:42] <bisectable6> sena_kun, Output on both points: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[18:43] <sena_kun> ryn1x, the thing is, `.contains` method is defined not on List, but on Cool, so it firstly stringifies your list and then tries to check if there is such a thing in this string (not a list).

[18:43] <sena_kun> while (elem) operator does the right thing

[18:44] <sena_kun> stringification leads to this:

[18:44] <sena_kun> m: my @menu = <hamburger fries milkshake>; say @menu.contains('milk');

[18:44] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´Calling '.contains' on a Array, did you mean 'needle (elem) list'?‚ê§True‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/HuYrb5yLt4 line 1‚ê§¬ª

[18:44] *** mensvaga left
[18:44] <sena_kun> ^ evaluates to true, because it actually asks "is there is a substring 'milk' in this string", instead of "we have three element array, is one of that a..."

[18:45] <ryn1x> ahhh ok. thanks!

[18:45] <sena_kun> m: say 2 (cont) <1 2 3>;

[18:45] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 13ca677e9: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[20:25] <tbrowder> [Coke]: see my comment in doc issue #3287. if okay, i will use similar in other instances of p6y...

[20:26] <tbrowder> .tell [Coke] ^^^

[21:54] <[Coke]> er, there is only one other instance.

[21:54] *** upupbb-user2 left

[21:56] <tbrowder> ok, i haven't done anything else since you implied there was a bunch of instances and i was waiting for approval of my proposal.

[22:23] <vrurg> If I define a method in grammar and use it as a validating token ‚Äì how do I signal no-match?

[22:25] *** dustinm` joined
[22:27] <lizmat> False ?

[22:27] <vrurg> No. A method must always return a Match object. Basically - self

[22:27] <lizmat> A Match object with pos == -1 ?

[22:28] <vrurg> Let me try... Thanks!

[22:30] <vrurg> self.clone: :pos(-1) didn't do it. Hm...

[22:31] <vrurg> I can <?{ self.method }>, but it's extra calls...

[22:32] <Altreus> How do I clear zef's cache? It's not finding my updated master branch for API::Discord

[22:32] <Altreus> (The update being to add a missing dep)

[22:33] <Altreus> (I'm installing the dep manually, I'm just academically interested for the future)

[22:37] <lizmat> vrurg: $!pos is a private attribute

[22:37] <lizmat> :pos(-1) is silently ignored, I'd say

[22:38] <lizmat> nqp::bindattr_i(cloned,Match,'$!pos',-1)

[22:39] <jnthn> vrurg: Try `self.new`

[22:39] <jnthn> vrurg: A cursor is born failed

[22:40] <vrurg> lizmat: Wanted to avoid relying on private staff. Also found self.'!cursor_fail'(), BTW.

[22:40] <vrurg> jnthn: That's the best. Thanks!
