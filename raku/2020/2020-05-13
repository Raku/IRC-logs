[02:11] <zacts> hello, are there any good books for learning raku?

[02:12] <zacts> I see this: https://docs.raku.org/language.html

[02:12] <zacts> but I don't see anything like modern perl for raku

[02:12] <zacts> the docs.raku.org seem to contain mainly topic references, at least as I'm skimming it now

[02:35] *** aborazmeh left
[02:44] <timotimo> zacts: you can have a look at perl6book.com

[02:47] <lucs> Hmm... Not sure why "Learning Perl 6" is in the "I'm a novice" section.

[02:48] <lucs> Even non-novices should enjoy that book's approach.

[05:32] <moritz> it explains loops, strings, arrays, variables and all those other concepts that experienced programmers find very boring

[05:35] <moritz> or course, experienced programmers can get joy out of it too, but that's very secondary

[13:31] <lizmat> I'll wait for someone to actually use it and having performance issues  :-)

[13:36] <elcaro> when for-looping over an iterable assigned to a scalar, is there any semantic/performace differences between `for $x<>`, `for $x[]`, and `for $x.list` ?

[13:38] *** stoned75 joined
[13:44] *** MasterDuke left
[13:47] <jnthn> for $x<> is a simple removal of the Scalar container, so the most direct; .list will cause storage of elements if it's a Seq, which may be undesirable if wanting laziness.

[16:28] <jjmerelo> Hej

[16:28] *** shadowpaste joined
[16:28] <jjmerelo> What would you say is the equivalent of the __name__ == __main__ in Python in Raku?

[16:28] *** NODE joined
[16:29] <jjmerelo> Best I could come up with is to compare $*PROGRAM to file name

[16:29] <dakkar> in p5 I've used `!defined caller`

[16:30] <jdv79> just curious - why would you want to do that?

[16:30] <jdv79> iirc in python its how they flip a file from action like a module or like a program or something.

[16:31] <jdv79> *acting

[16:31] <jjmerelo> same reason as in python

[16:31] <jjmerelo> Load a program to test whatever is defined there without starting the actual main part of the program.

[16:32] <jjmerelo> I'm using Cro::HTTP::Test to test a microservice which can be also run independently

[16:35] <guifa2> For POD, is there any way to link to code objects (classes, methods, or even blocks)?  I'm 99.9% sure the answer is no as links only go to other POD documents or URIs, but I feel like it might be a fairly useful thing to do.

[16:35] *** NODE left
[16:38] <jjmerelo> guifa2 there was an ad-hoc way of doing it, but it was obliterated in 2018

[16:39] <guifa2> Ah.  I ask because there are sort of two separate POD annotations ‚Äî¬†the one that flows with the document, and the one that attaches to classes/methods/etc.  It seems like it would be good to be able to link to content of either

[16:39] *** xinming_ left
[16:40] *** xinming_ joined
[16:46] *** poohman left
[16:46] <jjmerelo> guifa2 can you clarify that?

[16:47] *** NODE joined
[16:47] <jjmerelo> Pods and comments are the same in Raku, they are part of the documentation "braid". So if you intersperse declarator blocks with POD blocks, they will both be parsed by the compiler

[16:51] <dakkar> maybe he means the bits you can get via `.WHY`

[16:53] *** poohman joined
[16:57] <guifa2> dakkar correct

[16:57] <dakkar> guifa2: so you'd like to L<#subname> or L<#classname> 

[16:58] *** guifa2_ joined
[16:59] <guifa2_> the .WHY  is functionally different, in that it's not really a parallel document that happens to be interleaved with the code, but it's actually literally attached to a single code entity

[17:00] <guifa2_> s/.WHY/.WHY-style annotations

[17:01] <dakkar> declarator blocks also appear in the $=pod array

[17:01] *** guifa2 left
[17:05] *** molaf joined
[17:08] <guifa2_> they do ‚Äî¬†and have a WHEREFORE method, that other pod elements don't

[17:09] <dakkar> correct

[17:09] <dakkar> now, I see some problems

[17:09] <dakkar> the pod6 documentation says that L<> can link to a *section*

[17:09] <dakkar> but declarator blocks are not (I think) sections

[17:09] <dakkar> also, they don't get names

[17:10] <dakkar> so, improvement: have them get the name of the thing they're documenting

[17:10] <dakkar> then, make them link targets

[17:10] <dakkar> we probably don't need namespacing

[17:11] <dakkar> guifa2_: I think this needs a bug report

[17:12] *** kensanata left
[17:16] <guifa2_> It possibly needs a bit more, possible a raku problem solving issue ‚Äî¬†for example, if you do a class with methods, and attach declarator pod to all of them, they are presented as top-level pod elements.  That feels....off, I mean, you *can* say $=pod[2].WHEREFORE.package

[17:17] <guifa2_> to try to figure out that in rendering it might need to be nestled inside of a class

[17:17] *** dakkar left
[17:18] <guifa2_> But I can't think of how to figure out handling a class within a class ‚Äî¬†classes don't have equivalent .package methods that I can see

[21:55] <poohman> in case all the data members in my class are private, then i will not have a default constructor for the class. Then will new() work?

[22:05] <guifa2_> pooman: the default constructor will work, so long as you don't have "is required"

[22:05] <guifa2_> m: class Foo { has $!bar }; say Foo.new;

[22:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17bf5d5f8: OUTPUT: ¬´Foo.new‚ê§¬ª

[22:06] <guifa2_> m: class Foo { has $!bar is required }; say Foo.new;

[22:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17bf5d5f8: OUTPUT: ¬´The attribute '$!bar' is required, but you did not provide a value for it.‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[22:07] <guifa2_> (but in the first case, $!bar will remain undefined and may or may not be useful)

[22:09] <melezhik> RakuDist now could run module test for multiple rakudo version in one click - http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist2/

[22:09] <melezhik> cc :AlexDaniel`

[22:09] *** brtastic left
[22:10] <AlexDaniel`> melezhik: where's 2015.12 ?

[22:11] *** Altai-man_ left
[22:11] <AlexDaniel`> also can you remove the ones that have point releases? That is, no reason to list 2020.05 if there's 2020.05.1, just list 2020.05.1 only

[22:14] *** poohman left
[22:20] <AlexDaniel`> 6c: say $*PERL.compiler.version

[22:20] <AlexDaniel`>  * 6c: say $*PERL

[22:20] <AlexDaniel`> ugh

[22:20] <committable6> AlexDaniel`, https://gist.github.com/f57c1703958a69ed691bd154562ab691

[22:20] <AlexDaniel`> 6c: say $*PERL

[22:20] <committable6> AlexDaniel`, https://gist.github.com/6c20d357c5f7fc7056a8cb59de94507d

[22:20] <melezhik> :AlexDaniel` is it better now?

[22:21] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: interesting! See https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/f57c1703958a69ed691bd154562ab691

[22:21] <tellable6> AlexDaniel`, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[22:21] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: 

[22:21] <tellable6> AlexDaniel`, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[22:22] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: basically, I think 2020.02.1 was botched a bit. The VERSION wasn't set correctly, for some reason

[22:22] <tellable6> AlexDaniel`, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[22:23] <AlexDaniel`> Altai-man_: 2020.05.1 is fine though

[22:23] <tellable6> AlexDaniel`, I'll pass your message to Altai-man_

[22:23] <AlexDaniel`> melezhik: yes, but there's still 2020.05

[22:23] <melezhik> fixed

[22:24] <AlexDaniel`> also, 2019.07.01 should be 2019.07.1 (not .01 but .1)

[22:24] <AlexDaniel`> I don't know if it makes a difference but maybe it makes sense to be more precise

[22:25] <melezhik> yeah, it's internally is converted into sha's but I'll fix it 

[22:25] <AlexDaniel`> that's really great I think, let's see if others find it useful

[22:26] <melezhik> yeah, thank you

[22:26] <AlexDaniel`> weekly: Ever wondered if your module works on older rakudo versions? Well, now you can test it with a few clicks: http://repo.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/rakudist2/ 

[22:26] <notable6> AlexDaniel`, Noted! (weekly)

[22:27] <AlexDaniel`> melezhik: can you add 2018.10 to the list? That was the last release supporting 6.c so maybe it is significant

[22:28] <melezhik> yeah. will do it later

[22:28] *** mowcat left
[22:28] <melezhik> need to go

[22:29] <AlexDaniel`> also maybe 2016.12 (debian oldstable) and 2017.12 so that there's at least one per year :)

[22:33] <AlexDaniel`> OK so it doesn't work for 2015.12‚Ä¶

[22:33] <AlexDaniel`> looking at the output, it seems like zef itself doesn't support 2015.12?

[22:34] <AlexDaniel`> what's the oldest version it does support then?

[22:35] *** mowcat joined
[22:35] <AlexDaniel`> anyway I just jumped in briefly to answer melezhik, won't be looking at it deeper now so I hope somebody else does
