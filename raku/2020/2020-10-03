[06:31] <jmerelo> Hey, Altai-man 

[06:31] <jmerelo> Do you think we cound do a Blin run "hacktoberfest edition" to give a little love to failing distributions?

[06:36] <Altai-man> jmerelo, how so? The modules failing are more are less stable and most of them are either beyond broken and need to be rewritten or have PRs, but authors have abandoned.

[06:37] <jmerelo> Altai-man: all 308 of the Always Fail? It's true that I've made a few PRs for "MissingDependency" with little success...

[06:40] <jmerelo> Altai-man: some of them are even community-maintained modules...

[06:42] *** rindolf joined
[06:46] <Altai-man> jmerelo, not sure about all of them. I have to do number of things now, so after some hours will be available.

[06:49] <jmerelo> Altai-man: thanks!

[06:53] <jmerelo> Also, hacktoberfest is now opt-in only https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update You need to add the "hacktoberfest" topic to the repository if you want PRs done to it to count.

[13:59] <tellable6> ggoebel, I'll pass your message to pamplemousse

[14:00] <ggoebel> it could probably use a review and recommendations for improvements...

[14:01] <ggoebel> kind of sad in that I haven't contributed much... but figured it might help others get over the initial hump

[14:36] <codesections> they're… ok, I guess.  Not great -- certainly not as good as if I used a CDN.  For my homepage: ~2.3s for a first view; < 0.1 for repeat views.  (But my server is on the west cost of the US, so I could improve that a lot just by moving it east or to Europe)

[14:36] <codesections> https://www.webpagetest.org/result/201003_DiWE_faebe64eb2cfe1e3b554dcff7aab97e4/

[14:42] <codesections> (The equivalent numbers for google.com are ~2.4s and ~2.3s for first & repeat views.  Given that they're presumably using the best CDN money can buy, I feel reasonably OK with my load times. https://www.webpagetest.org/result/201003_DiVR_e3d80c486c5d89a319f3105bfe7ec0bd/)

[14:46] <codesections> (On the other hand, they're loading so much JavaScript that they're transmitting literally 100× as many bytes as I am, so they do start with a bit of a disadvantage.  On the third hand, though, they have < 20 visible words and I'm not at all confident that much of that JS is for the user's benefit.  So I'm not really inclined to cut them much slack for that self-imposed page weight)

[23:20] <colomon_> MasterDuke: excellent idea, but I’m on MacOS, and apparently Apple borked dtrace in the name of greater security.  :\ 

[23:31] <timotimo> at least on linux, ld has its own debug env vars

[23:33] <timotimo> LD_DEBUG=files or libs could be interesting

[23:38] <timotimo> does ltrace exist?

[23:41] <colomon_> don’t think so?

[23:41] <colomon_> I’ve gotten beyond the last error by copying (sigh) libgtk-3.dylib to /usr/local/lib

[23:42] <colomon_> still getting a warning message: dbus[80687]: Dynamic session lookup supported but failed: launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded!

[23:43] <colomon_> but after copying libgobject-2.0.dylib to /usr/local/lib as well, the first GTK::Simple example does run
