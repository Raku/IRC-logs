[05:40] <samebchase-> If I have a list of hashes, what's the best way to destructure each hashes keys in a pointy loop? Say this is my hash: `%foo = %{a => 1, b => 2}` how do I introduce variables `$a` and `$b` which destructure those respective keys?  

[05:42] <samebchase-> I know how to do it in a function signature and in a variable binding. I'm getting tripped up trying to do the same in a pointy loop.

[05:45] <samebchase-> I am trying something like `for %foo, %foo -> (% (:a(:$a), :b(:$b)) { say $a, $b }` also is there any shortcut where the keys are not expected to be renamed?

[08:42] <patrickb> How can I mark a test to not be run automatically during install and similar?

[08:42] <patrickb> is this what xt/ is for?

[09:04] <MasterDuke> i believe the testing tools usually don't run xt/ test automatically

[09:05] <patrickb> I just read about the Lancester consensus https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md#environment-variables-for-testing-contexts

[09:05] <patrickb> Seems Perl has quite a sophisticated system for this

[09:05] <patrickb> I suspect we don't.

[14:44] <[Coke]> who "owns" rakudo.org? looking at https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/issues/7 - need to decide if we really do want to be pushing only star vs. compiler, the notes there need to be considered in the scope of the rename, and zoffix noted that at one point rakudo.org was just going to redirect to raku.org

[14:45] <[Coke]> I don't know if anyone is planning for that last thing to still happen.

[14:51] <vrurg> [Coke]: the redirect thing doesn't look right to me.

[14:52] <vrurg> But the ownership of the repository is better be transferred to rakudo org

[15:01] <patrickb> Coke: I did the last larger rework of rakudo.org. I think there is no real owner of the website.

[15:01] <patrickb> I think there currently isn't much of a long term plan wrt the website.

[15:02] <patrickb> An important bit that changed since that ticket is the relocatable precompiled releases.

[15:03] <patrickb> I personally prefer those to the Star bundles. The current website reflects that a little bit.

[15:03] <[Coke]> the problem with putting it into the rakudo org is that then it gets tied up with CLAs.

[15:04] *** xinming joined
[15:04] <[Coke]> I did the two low hanging items left in #7 - going to close out that ticket, folks can re-open tickets for any items not covered, I think.

[15:04] <patrickb> I don't think merging rakudo.org back into raku.org is going to happen. I mean, we can do that, but in the past the strong counter argument has always been to not discourage alternative implementations.

[15:04] <[Coke]> there's a ticket to move it to the Raku org so at least it's out of perl6/

[15:08] <El_Che> There is certainly merit to the different implementation argument, but for most of the world it's very confusing

[16:32] <guifa2> jnthn: question I had the other day is whether augment by design is supposed to be lexically scoped or if the current functionality (acting globally) is the intended functionality?

[16:33] <guifa2> I can see great reasons for both, but one will make my life a lot easier :-)

[16:35] <jnthn> It's global

[16:36] <jnthn> In general, OO things and lexical things are orthogonal

[16:41] <guifa2> jnthn: okay, sweet.  I'm finishing up a UserTimezone module that gets me an Olson ID.  Since I need the latter for proper date formatting, I think I'm going to have Intl::* augment with an tz-identifier method and wrap the new to set it on creation 

[16:41] <guifa2> augment DateTime, I mean

[16:41] <[Coke]> if you want limited impact from an OO change, you can subclass and use just the subclass in your local scope

[16:42] <guifa2> [Coke] I don't :-)

[16:42] <[Coke]> ok. :)

[16:46] <tbrowder> anybody running raku on openbsd? if so, any way to install other than source or rakubrew for up-to-date releases? what do you recommend? thanks.

[16:47] <jnthn> guifa2: Just be aware that augment and preocmpilation do not play well together.

[16:51] <guifa2> jnthn: makes sense.  DateTime stuff will be in beta for a while so I can play around with different strategies for approaching it and see the impacts they have

[16:53] <guifa2> Actually

[16:54] <guifa2> jnthn: wrapping probably wouldn't have the same precompilation issues would it?  so if I wrapped .new and did a mix in?

[19:35] *** oddp_ left
[19:43] <rypervenche> I'm curious how you all do your modules. Up until now I've only been installing modules via zef for my user, however I've recently had the need to run a script as root. Do you all just let zef install into /usr/share/perl6? I normally avoid anything not from my package manager putting things into root-owned directories like that. But forcing zef to use /root/.raku feels kind of hacky.

[19:43] <rypervenche> And also isn't completely perfect, since p6doc still installed into /usr/share/perl6.

[22:44] <rir> On  https://docs.raku.org  the search widget is ineffective when the result set exceeds the browser's height.

[22:46] <timotimo> oh dang

[22:46] <timotimo> can you give an example or two for that situation?

[22:46] <timotimo> like searching for "a" or "n" or so?

[23:20] <oddp> Is there a way to pass a reduction operator similar to .map(&[*])?

[23:24] <jnthn> No special syntax for it, but {[+] @_} is quite short

[23:25] <jnthn> m: sub foo(&x) { x(1,2,3) }; say foo {[+] @_}

[23:25] <jnthn> m: sub foo(&x) { x([1,2,3]) }; say foo {[+] @_} # or by single arg rule, this
