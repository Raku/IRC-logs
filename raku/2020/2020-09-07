[08:41] *** ensamvarg3 joined
[08:45] <jmerelo> Xliff: it shouldn't. But I guess that it does not work anyway, right?

[08:57] <Xliff> Yeah.

[08:57] <Xliff> I thought you could add methods at runtime.

[09:05] <Kaiepi> xliff, i ran into a problem similar to this when writing Trait::Traced

[09:05] <Kaiepi> it's probably attributes at play here, not so much methods

[09:06] <Kaiepi> does calling either .^compose or .^compose_repr after messing with the attribute fix things?

[09:06] <Kaiepi> on self, i mean

[09:12] *** maettu left
[09:16] <Xliff> Nope

[09:16] <Xliff> I think I may have to handle this at runtime.

[09:17] <Xliff> nine++ has mentioned that run-time is too late to use sub trait:<handles>. I think BEGIN might be too late, too.

[09:18] <Xliff> for trait:<handles>, I think the first .^compose is the only time it works.

[09:19] <Xliff> Soo.... maybe...

[09:19] <Xliff> Use a sub as the arg for handles trait?

[09:19] *** Kaiepi left
[09:21] *** Kaeipi joined
[09:23] <Xliff> And... that doesn't work either.

[09:44] *** m_athias joined
[09:46] <Xliff>  Based on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/traits.pm6#L515, would that be called like "has $!s handles(&sub)", so would "has $! handles( subWithArgs( ... ) } also work as long as subWithArgs() returns a list?

[09:46] <Xliff> Because I've tested the last one, and that didn't.

[09:56] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[09:58] <Kaiepi> something like this? https://pastebin.run/kc23p9bV4s

[10:00] <Xliff> Let's see.

[10:00] <Xliff> Still no go.

[10:01] <dakkar> Xliff: that trait is for a method, not an attribute

[10:01] <dakkar> (notice the type of the first parameter)

[10:02] <Xliff> Ah. Missed that. Thanks. Still... look at Kaiepi's gist

[10:03] <dakkar> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/traits.pm6#L434

[10:03] <dakkar> slightly more complicated logic

[10:03] <Xliff> dakkar: Yes. I know htat.

[10:04] <dakkar> Kaiepi's gist works because the sub-with-args is called before the trait

[10:04] <Xliff> Nevertheless, things I am trying look like they should work. They throw no exceptions, but I do not get a positive result from my test case.

[10:04] <dakkar> so it's equivalent to `has $.bar handles ('foo'')`

[10:04] <Xliff> Right.

[10:05] <Xliff> And my latest test case should do the same, and return all the methods of the class 'SOUP::Server', but if I try and run a SOUP::Server method on my test object, it doesn't work.

[10:05] <dakkar> you can use anything that will work on the rhs of ~~, though

[10:05] <Xliff> Rather. .^lookup doesn't return a method.

[10:05] <dakkar> if you want to delegate all methods, `handles *` should do that

[10:06] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[10:06] *** Kaeipi joined
[10:06] <Xliff> dakkar++ -- Let me try that.

[10:06] <dakkar> (but notice that those are added as fallback, not methods, so I'm not sure you can easily introspect them)

[10:07] <Xliff> HEY! That worked.

[10:07] <dakkar> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/traits.pm6#L465

[10:07] *** Kaiepi left
[10:08] <Xliff> OK, so still no-go on the introspection. 

[10:08] <Xliff> Still, this works. Thanks, dakkar~

[10:08] <dakkar> probably because of the fallback bit

[10:08] <dakkar> https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#index-entry-handles_trait-handles should probably document that
