[06:22] <Geth> ¦ advent: Annotation: The web developer is faced with the need to use templating engines. The Raku ecosystem provides several modules for this task. We will try to compare these modules according to their main characteristic — performance. Also we will iterpret the results and finally answer: is it possible to create a fast interactive Raku-driven web application.

[09:02] <tadzik> computer, messages

[09:02] <tadzik> AlexDaniel`: ah, makes sense. I guess this is soon enough too :)

[09:08] <AlexDaniel`> yeah :) I have not yet seen tellable not deliver any message, in fact it seems to be more reliable because it autocorrects nicknames and complains when it can't

[09:08] <AlexDaniel`> compared to the previous bot that is

[09:08] <AlexDaniel`> well, accidentally not deliver, it does not deliver intentionally in that special case when you reply really quick :)

[09:10] <AlexDaniel`> although I can totally see how the functionality is not explicit enough when trying to overthink it :(

[09:10] <AlexDaniel`> maybe it should send a /notice instead, that'd be lovely

[13:06] <xinming> SmokeMachine: The many-to-many thing, to an old DBIC user, I feel   `has @.blis is relationship( *.bli-id, :many-to-many{ .bles }, :model<Bli> );`   more natural

[13:08] <xinming> SmokeMachine: BTW, is it possible to fetch specified columns from a "ResultSeq"? I thought that we don't need to build a full Object, But we can specify columns, and let ResultSeq returns Hash for each object when user specifies columns to the search.

[13:08] <SmokeMachine> xinming: would you mind to comment that on https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/454?

[13:09] <SmokeMachine> xinming: a .map would do that

[13:09] <xinming> Maybe something like,     Model.^all.grep({ .name = ... }).columns(<col1 col2 col3>, :hash);

[13:09] <SmokeMachine> but it doesn't accept returning a hash yet...

[13:10] <xinming> SmokeMachine: Ok, so when we try to fetch columns from the ResultSeq, We'll get the sql correctly generated?

[13:10] <xinming> Let's say, when we fetch 2 columns, the sql emitted to server will also be SELECT col1, col2 FROM xxxx; right?

[13:11] <xinming> SmokeMachine: Will comment on 454 later.

[13:11] <SmokeMachine> for now, it's possible to do `Model.^all.grep({ .name = ... }).map({ .col1, .col2, .col3 });`, but in the future it's planed to support: `Model.^all.grep({ .name = ... }).map({ %( col1 => .col1, col2 => .col2, col3 => .col3 ) });`

[13:12] <xinming> Ok, Thanks.

[19:40] <pkmnx> hiya, I running through all the various texts w/ learning raku & just "discovered" the 'X' infix operator & I'm so happy to find it. 

[19:41] <pkmnx> because its feed me from writing a certain class of nested for loops, which I've always hated.

[19:41] <pkmnx> but, while I can go look for it, I thought, I'd just ask here:

[19:42] <pkmnx> is there any such operator that let's me loop over indices of arrays of arrays or hashes of hashes, and so on ?

[19:43] <pkmnx> w/out using the unsightly nests of nests ?

[19:43] <pkmnx> I just realized how much I hate writing them.

[19:43] <jmerelo> hi, pkmnx 

[19:44] <jmerelo> There's deepmap and duckmap. Did you check them out? Not operators, but will probably get you there. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50201995/what-does-duckmap-really-do

[20:27] <pkmnx> I think i understand these routines, say, deep map, but I wasn't sure how to emit indices as I descended.

[20:27] <pkmnx> in essence - imagine you have:

[20:27] <pkmnx> my $k = { '0' => { 'a' => 'b' }, '1' => { 'd' => 'e' }, 'g' => { 'k' => 'g' }, 'm' => { 'l' => 's' } };

[20:28] <pkmnx> and you run:

[20:28] <pkmnx> <pre>for ( $k.keys ) -&gt; $ky { for ( $ky.kv ) -&gt; $kky, $v {   &quot;$ky $kky $v&quot;.say;}}</pre>

[20:28] <pkmnx> which would give:

[20:28] <pkmnx> g 0 g0 0 01 0 1m 0 m

[20:28] <pkmnx> or, something like that, formatted better ...

[20:31] <pkmnx> actually: see:

[20:31] <pkmnx> for ( $k.keys ) -> $ky { for ( $k{$ky}.kv) -> $kky, $v {

[20:32] <pkmnx> and so, $ky & $kky are the branches, so to speak and $v is the leaf, so to speak ...

[20:34] <MasterDuke> maybe a recursive gather/take?

[20:40] <melezhik> I've described an idea of RakuPlay and question about it's future. So I'd appreciate feedback ...  https://sparrowdo.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/rakuplay-introduction/

[20:43] <Altai-man> melezhik, does it have API? :)

[20:44] *** guifa` left
[20:45] *** wamba left
[20:45] <melezhik> so far it's a web, but nobody would prevent you from curling it )) - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuPlay/blob/main/app.raku#L63

[20:46] <melezhik> again, right now it's just a draft if I see an interest I could eventually add more features ...

[20:46] <melezhik> here is the a route - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuPlay/blob/main/app.raku#L25

[20:48] <Altai-man> melezhik, if I won't die writing docs, I see it could fit nice after some changes to be used to execute raku docs examples. Right now I have glot.io integration, but given glot.io probably does not want us to spam potential lots of queries to a poor single API token, there is a sense to self-host something secure and robust enough for examples execution.

[20:49] <tyil> melezhik: in https://sparrowdo.wordpress.com/2020/08/28/raku-utils-proposal/, note that `s6` already exists as software packaged in a number of GNU+Linux distributions (https://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/)

[20:49] <melezhik> I wish I could share the post via reddit, but lately reddit bots treated all my posts as spam =L  , so sometimes Liz post some of my posts, thanks  

[20:50] *** wamba joined
[20:50] <melezhik> Altai-man " there is a sense to self-host something secure and robust enough for examples execution." - fair enough !

[20:50] *** simcop2387 left
[20:51] <melezhik> tyil oh, no ))) it was in the moment when I rewrote Sparrow from Perl to Perl6 , here is why the name is

[20:51] <Altai-man> I understand the actual field suggested is much wider: more suitable for e.g. bisecting between releases or comparing result between OS images.

[20:51] <tyil> I expected as much, I'm just warning you in case it confuses readers

[20:51] <tyil> I don't think s6 is pre-installed in any distro, though

[20:52] <melezhik> tyil sure, thanks, maybe one day I'll rename it, not a big deal, I don't have a huge community to ruin , ha-ha ))) 

[20:52] <tyil> hehe

[20:52] *** simcop2387 joined
[20:54] <melezhik> Altai-man not sure if RP is competitive with bisectable, at least RP is quite slow I am afraid, but yeah you are right, RP is just wider, but I don't know what people might want to, so here is the post

[20:54] *** wamba left
[20:55] <Altai-man> Argh, I am too dumb to write docker files.

[21:14] <MasterDuke> are you building rakudo yourself for each commit? or using builds from shareable6?

[21:16] <melezhik> MasterDuke I use whateverable builds, https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6-rakudo-install/blob/master/lib/Sparrow6/Rakudo/Install.pm6#L120

[21:16] <melezhik> so looks like the same?

[21:17] <melezhik> so, I don't build for sure

[21:17] *** natrys left
[21:19] <MasterDuke> nice, glad to see the reuse

[21:20] <melezhik> yeah, build from source would be crazy slow ... 

[21:27] <Altai-man> Can anyone please help me with writing a dockerfile for cro? https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/89e8181b2d22054adfffcbd6ac1ad01e <- this is what I have.

[21:27] <Altai-man> I get "Installed: rakudo-pkg-2020.10-02.x86_64", fine

[21:27] <Altai-man> But then

[21:28] <Altai-man> Step 8/15 : RUN /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user .... /usr/bin/env: 'perl6': No such file or directory

[21:28] <Altai-man> ???

[21:28] <Altai-man> No, I cannot use Cro docker images, they are too old. No, I cannot use rakudo-star, its OpenSSL module is broken.

[21:29] <[Coke]> where does "install-zef-as-user" come from?

[21:29] <Altai-man> That's a script in /opt that comes from rakudo-pkg package I believe.

[21:29] <[Coke]> rakudo-pkg?

[21:29] <Altai-man> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#zef-module-manager-as-a-regular-user

[21:29] <Altai-man> Yeah.

[21:30] <[Coke]> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/master/docker/install-zef-as-user

[21:31] <Altai-man> I am too tired and something this simple should just work but here I am spending three hours on nothing and probably too irritated to see what I missed. :\

[21:33] <[Coke]> sorry, meant to followup - might need to update your path

[21:33] <[Coke]> would explain the "can't find perl6"

[21:34] <Altai-man> Move ENV one line above?

[21:34] * Altai-man tries

[21:34] *** Tirifto left
[21:35] <[Coke]> <nod>

[21:35] <[Coke]> oh, didn't even see it below, aye. :)

[21:35] <melezhik> Altai-man `ENV PATH=~/.raku/bin:/ opt/rakudo-pkg/:$PATH` ?

[21:36] <melezhik> `ENV PATH=~/.raku/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/:$PATH` ?

[21:38] <melezhik> `ENV PATH=~/.raku/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/:$PATH` ?

[21:39] <Altai-man> same

[21:40] <Altai-man> same with just moving above, same with `Step 8/13 : ENV PATH=~/.raku/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/:$PATH`

[21:44] <[Coke]> are you sure you need the =?

[21:45] <[Coke]> ah. optional but ok, maybe

[21:45] <Altai-man> Yes, two other variables I have are with =

[21:47] <[Coke]> trying to do a build with your file locally...

[21:51] <[Coke]> boy, lsb is bringing in a LOT of stuff.

[21:51] <[Coke]> are you getting it only for rakudo-pkg? can't use the builtin installer?

[21:52] <Altai-man> You mean `redhat-lsb-core`?

[21:52] <[Coke]> yes

[21:52] <[Coke]> I ditched the other stuff to speed up testing.

[21:53] <Altai-man> It's needed to execute `lsb_release -is`, yes.

[21:53] *** ben_ left
[21:53] <Altai-man> Can hardcode `Fedora/32` I guess.

[21:57] <[Coke]> trying a potential fix, will let you know in 5m. :|

[21:58] <Altai-man> [Coke], it builds quite fast for me, so you can post a gist not to stress your hardware...

[21:58] *** ben_ joined
[21:58] <[Coke]> change "~" to "/root"

[21:59] <[Coke]> I don't think ~ or $HOME is going to work in that context.

[21:59] <[Coke]> and I think "/root" is root's homedir on that box

[21:59] * Altai-man tries

[21:59] <[Coke]> bah. nope

[22:01] *** MasterDuke left
[22:01] <Altai-man> No. :S

[22:01] *** BenGoldberg joined
[22:02] <[Coke]> trying to do it from inside the docker container so I can see what's going on

[22:06] <[Coke]> there is nothing in /root/.raku/bin

[22:06] <[Coke]> /root/.raku doesn't exist.

[22:07] <[Coke]> you want /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin

[22:07] <[Coke]> from the instructions for rakudo-pkg: PATH=~/.raku/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH

[22:07] <[Coke]> raku/bin is for your own stuff if you get that far, but it's not where perl6 is installed.

[22:08] <[Coke]> try that, let me know if it works.

[22:10] * Altai-man tries

[22:11] *** melezhik joined
[22:14] <Altai-man> Yay. Something installs.

[22:14] <melezhik> cool

[22:14] <Altai-man> I hope it won't stumble upon `Pod::From::Cache:ver<0.2+> not found`...

[22:14] <Altai-man> [Coke]++ melezhik++

[22:23] <melezhik> found a bug in red doc? - https://rakudist.raku.org/sparky/report/RakuPlay-2/1367 

[22:23] <melezhik> or at least bug in an example code ? ))))

[22:24] <melezhik> doc's code might not works ... ? ))) or it should ?

[22:25] <melezhik> let's run something from https://github.com/FCO/Red/tree/master/examples ....

[22:26] <melezhik> oh, they require some libs ...

[22:28] <melezhik> oh, I was wrong, I should have used a `Red` in the beginning probably 

[22:30] <melezhik> still failed- https://rakudist.raku.org/sparky/report/RakuPlay-2/1371
