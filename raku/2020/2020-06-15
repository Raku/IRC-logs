[07:51] <dakkar> I'm not sure that `if` sets `$_`

[07:54] <dakkar> fluca1978: does that help?

[07:56] <fluca1978> dakkar: thanks, but $_ is set into a loop, the code is     for 10 .. 99 { @found.push: $_ if [+] $_.split( '', :skip-empty ) == 4; }

[07:56] *** Sgeo_ left
[07:57] <dakkar> ah!

[07:59] <dakkar> it's a precedence issue

[07:59] <dakkar> m: my @found; for 10 .. 99 { @found.push: $_ if ([+] $_.split( '', :skip-empty )) == 4; }; say @found

[08:00] <dakkar> the `==` was parsed tighter than the `[+]`

[08:03] <dakkar> precedence is hard!

[15:03] <[Coke]> JJMerelo: hi

[15:03] <[Coke]> .tell JJMerelo getting failures on xt/p6doc-blackbox.t again - wondering if we can sunset this now that we have the new repo with rakudoc.

[15:03] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[15:04] *** patrickb joined
[15:04] <JJMerelo> [Coke] yes, we should. rakudoc is released, only it's not totally tested. Much better than the current state of p6doc anyway.

[15:05] <JJMerelo> Please ping the corresponding issue, and I'll try to take care of this before the end of the week.

[15:06] <[Coke]> haven't opened a ticket yet, will try to remember after $dayjob - thanks!

[15:07] <melezhik> .tell JJMerelo I'd like to see some use cases / scenarios how you'd see these checks - https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/issues/505

[15:07] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to JJMerelo

[15:08] <JJMerelo> Hi, melezhik

[15:08] <melezhik> Hi!

[15:08] <JJMerelo> I don't know if you have seen this https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/master/META6.json

[15:08] <JJMerelo> I think it's the only example of a META6 that includes external requirements.

[15:09] <melezhik> I have. I am asking about more higher level view , provided that we know _how_ to provide this data

[15:10] <JJMerelo> It's barely documented, and I don't think it's actually used by zef. But I think that if we're going to deploy the specification throughout the ecosystem, it's what we should use.

[15:10] <melezhik> say, all devs start diligently writing all  external deps through Meta for theirs modules, then what?

[15:11] <JJMerelo> Ah, OK

[15:11] <JJMerelo> I guess write some humongous GitHub action to take care of it?

[15:11] <JJMerelo> using your stuff?

[15:11] <melezhik> GitHub action for what?

[15:12] <JJMerelo> Carry out tests

[15:12] <JJMerelo> in Raku/ecosystem, we don't do much more than that...

[15:12] <JJMerelo> We check the META6.json, we download and run tests. Which fail if there's some external dependency...

[15:12] <melezhik> so, you mean tests for community modules? what blin does?

[15:12] <JJMerelo> Blink does it for releases; I'd want it for those uploaded for the ecosystem.

[15:13] <JJMerelo> ideally, there should be some way also for those in CPAN, but that will have to run in an external infraestructure.

[15:13] <JJMerelo> The principle is the same anyway.

[15:14] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/06/15/2020-24-cloud-approaching/

[15:14] * JJMerelo retweets, likes, and so on.

[15:17] <melezhik> jjatria rakudist now covers both CPAN and github modules BTW

[15:17] *** soursBot left
[15:17] <melezhik> so, the problem like I said, it's all makes a sense if people do provide info in Meta for external dependencies

[15:18] <JJMerelo> melezhik that's great. Still, I'd like to be able to use it when someone uploads a new module, as an initial test. Right now we can't. So I guess using Meta for that is the standard way to go.

[15:18] <melezhik> also like you said "I don't think it's actually used by zef" is also a question

[15:18] <melezhik> do we want to utilize META6 to pass information which is not going to be consumed by zef ?

[15:18] <JJMerelo> melezhik well, zef can't really know how to install all different kind of things.

[15:19] <JJMerelo> melezhik the thing is, that's the spec, so we should use it.

[15:19] <melezhik> yeah, I am not asking if it can, I am just highlighting that it seems to me, now META is primary domain of zef, is not it?  

[15:19] <JJMerelo> melezhik that we probably need something else, well, that's almost for sure. 

[15:20] <JJMerelo> melezhik not really. It's metadata for different things in the ecosystem.

[15:20] <JJMerelo> it's read by the ecosystem when it's submitted for the first time, it's used for reverse and forward dependence analysis...

[15:21] <melezhik> as for rakudist , like I said it uses Sparrow automation under the hood - https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/modules/default-github/sparrowfile

[15:21] <melezhik> so it's not a big deal to this pieces of logic to this scenario

[15:22] <JJMerelo> melezhik so what I was thinking about is to create a GitHub action that uses Sparrow to grab dependencies, as read from the META6.json

[15:22] <melezhik> that gets an external deps information from whatever source and use it to install dependencies and finally run zef tests  and report any errors

[15:22] <JJMerelo> and then test.

[15:22] <JJMerelo> OK, so tests are a given. So much better

[15:22] <melezhik> GitHub action could call RakuDist API

[15:23] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist/blob/master/docs/api.md#bash-automation-example

[15:23] <melezhik> not necessarily run Sparrow scripts directly 

[15:23] <melezhik> though the last is also doable, but mean doing a whole new pieces of software  

[15:24] <JJMerelo> OK. But that's hosted somewhere, right?

[15:24] <melezhik> yes!

[15:24] <melezhik> as mentioned in the documentation - http://rakudist.raku.org/

[15:26] <JJMerelo> OK. Whatever way you think is better, is fine for me.

[15:26] *** oddp joined
[15:26] <melezhik> well I mean we could try various options ...

[15:26] <JJMerelo> Nothing is free, so I guess we'll have to work, but in the end, the ecosystem will be better.

[15:26] <melezhik> what do you be "ecosystem will be better"?

[15:27] <melezhik> be -> mean

[15:29] <JJMerelo> Well, we will be able to install only those that have well-specified dependencies, and those will also be tested before being included in the ecosystem.

[15:30] <melezhik> so it will work as a quality gate? only those that have valid META (with ext dependecies declared) and pass tests will be merged to eco system, is it what you mean?

[15:32] *** brtastic left
[15:33] <JJMerelo> melezhik well, that's what we do now with those without external dependencies. That would be good for starters.

[15:33] <JJMerelo> But at the end, the real benefit would be the specification of external dependencies in a standard way
