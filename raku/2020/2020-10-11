[08:41] <Zero_Dogg> moritz: Bought your book. It's being really helpful in updating my regex knowledge to raku syntax and learning grammars properly. Cheers!

[08:54] <moritz> Zero_Dogg: glad you like it :-)

[08:54] <moritz> I'd really appreciate a short review and rating on amazon, that's what helps others to discover it

[08:57] <Zero_Dogg> sure, I can do that

[20:33] <Racuda> say " {map {:5(.base(3))%2 },[X+&] ^2**32xx 2}"

[20:33] <tobs> Racuda: there is a #whateverable channel where evalable6 also hangs out. If you want to tweak your command before asking a question about it, you should do that there.

[20:33] <tobs> (or with your local rakudo installation)

[20:33] <Racuda> i am new what does  {map {:3(.base(2))%2 },[X+&] ^2**$_ xx 2} do?

[20:34] <Racuda> tobs

[20:35] <Racuda> in english

[20:35] <tobs> `^2**$x` is a range from 0 to 2**$x which you create twice (the `xx 2` part)

[20:36] <Racuda> mm

[20:37] <tobs> these two lists are passed into a reduction operator `[X+&]` which is composed of two operators: X which takes the two lists and creates all possible pairs from them (the cartesian product)

[20:37] <tobs> all these pairs are then passed to the +& operator which is bitwise AND

[20:38] <Racuda> mmm

[20:38] <tobs> so you get a long output list with all bitwise ANDs of pairs of numbers from 0 to 2**$x, which is in turn passed into the `map` block

[20:39] <Racuda> wow thanks

[20:39] <tobs> which converts each number to binary .base(2), interprets that as a ternary number with :3 and then reduces that modulo 2

[20:39] <tobs> Why all of this happens, I have no idea.

[20:39] <Racuda> is there a script to translate raku to english?

[20:40] <tobs> I know of none.

[20:40] <Racuda> it generates Walsh matrix

[20:40] <Racuda> it would help

[20:41] <Racuda> thanks though great explaining

[20:42] <tobs> I see, that's why you want the cartesian product of those lists of numbers.

[20:42] <Racuda> i found the snippet searching Walsh

[20:43] <Racuda> it works

[22:19] <Xliff> Is there a way to return a portion of a CArray starting at a specific position?

[22:20] <Xliff> Because the best way to do certain things, especially with C, is to use $buffer + $pos, to get what basically amounts to a $buffer[$pos], but as its own CArray

[22:21] <Xliff> Is there an actual list of methods for CArray? The NativeCall documentation is rather light on the subject. 

[22:22] <Xliff> What is here is really insufficient... https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#CArray_methods
