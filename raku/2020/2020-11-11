[10:23] <v_m_v> Hello. What is the state of Raku on Arm? I've saw the new propossition from Apple (their new Arm) it is amazing. It would be so awesome to use Raku there with the full performance. 

[10:30] <MasterDuke> it runs, but without the JIT. however, that's not quite as bad as it sounds, since a lot of the recent performance work has been in spesh and other parts of moarvm/rakudo that don't require the JIT

[10:32] <v_m_v> Are there any plans to move JIT to Arm? Does web server would feel that difference? I know that Arm is not as popular as x86 but Apple is going there which will bring more companies to 5nm world. 

[10:32] <MasterDuke> brrt++, the JIT creator, has expressed an interest in acquiring a AArch64 device to work on porting the JIT to that particular Arm architecture, but there haven't been any concrete steps taken yet

[11:18] <jmerelo> Raku is out of the TIOBE index https://tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ We were barely in, but we're totally out now...

[11:18] <tellable6> 2020-11-09T15:15:09Z #raku-dev <jjatria> jmerelo: Belated thanks for the Gitlab invite!

[11:26] <Altreus> > programming skills are needed everywhere nowadays and there is a lack of good software developers

[11:26] <Altreus> So what we did is we widened the net so now even untrained people can be considered software developers!

[11:29] *** MasterDuke joined
[11:31] <MasterDuke> v_m_v: that's a good question. not sure i have a good feel for an answer, timotimo might. fwiw, if you have a workload you're curious about you can test. running with the env variable MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 will leave all the other optimizations enabled, but turn off the jit

[15:57] <jmerelo> the advent Calendar is almost here, and we need writers! https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2020/authors.md

[15:58] <jmerelo> .tell guifa` this year we're going to need the articles before December proper so that we can schedule without any hitch. Please upload it to the repo, and I'll schedule it as soon as possible.

[15:58] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to guifa

[15:58] <jmerelo> .seen tmtvl

[15:58] <tellable6> jmerelo, I saw tmtvl 2019-09-12T15:30:35Z in #perl6: <tmtvl> Hm, odd, maybe my local install is outdated...

[15:58] <jmerelo> .seen nige123

[15:58] <tellable6> jmerelo, I haven't seen nige123 around, did you mean nige1?

[15:59] <jmerelo> .seen nige

[15:59] <tellable6> jmerelo, I saw nige 2020-09-21T19:21:01Z in #raku: <nige> OK - no worries

[15:59] <timotimo> oh no oh no oh no

[15:59] <jmerelo> .tell Altai-man please get your articles for advent ready as soon as possible. I'd like to have at least two weeks programmed before the end of November.

[15:59] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to Altai-man

[15:59] <jmerelo> timotimo: you up for an advent calendar article? Please?

[16:00] <timotimo> i'll have to think of something

[16:00] <jmerelo> Please do :-)

[16:00] <timotimo> got suggestions?

[16:00] <jmerelo> timotimo This year we'd like to make then beginner-ready, if possible.

[16:01] <timotimo> what does that mean exactly? you should have a use for the topic even if you haven't raku'd much before?

[16:01] <jmerelo> as in, no prior knowledge of Raku (or as little as possible). So anything is game: regular expressions, arrays, whatever.

[16:01] *** v_m_v left
[16:02] <jmerelo> timotimo: well, kinda. I'd like people to get tickled by the fantastic way something is done in Raku, but also see step by step how something is done.

[16:02] <moritz> I could write something about how you can make declarative APIs with raku

[16:03] <moritz> Cro-style :D

[16:03] <jmerelo> moritz: wonderful! Add yourself to the roster, and start working on it :-)

[16:03] <timotimo> should we try, this time, to give a "run this in some kind of online evaluation site" for every piece of code?

[16:04] <jmerelo> timotimo: that would be in line with the beginner-friendly requirement, absolutely.

[16:04] *** v_m_v joined
[16:07] <timotimo> we have a variety of ways to write our advent posts that people use

[16:07] <timotimo> it'd be good to have something that makes posts a bit more uniform, even when they come from different kinds of sources

[16:07] <timotimo> (i.e. i don't want to force people to use a specific way to write the posts)

[22:27] <timotimo> i'm expecting at least part of that was stuff released to cpan before the bot came back up

[22:27] <timotimo> otherwise that would be quite impressive :)

[22:28] <timotimo> which is honestly not all that rare for our lizmat :D

[22:49] <lizmat> timotimo: it was basically a. making sure it the modules run on 6.e, change pod to emphasize Raku more, add some pod for future problems with callers $_ being the default

[22:49] <lizmat> almost mechanical updates, but still not mechanical enough to write a script for it

[23:02] <timotimo> still, good work :)
