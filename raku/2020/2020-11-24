[04:57] <guifa> Sometimes you never realize how useful some meta operators can be

[04:58] <guifa> I have a point where I’ve got some complex fallback rules.  

[04:59] <guifa> $foo = [//] $optA, $optB, $optC, $optD, … 

[04:59] <guifa> Looks really nice when all the options are on their own commented lines and you just see $foo = [//] at the top

[17:10] <guifa> leont: no, I don’t believe you can, unless maybe the thing you’re exporting to wants to identify itself, then maybe you can pull it off via a dynamic variable

[17:11] <guifa> Or, I guess you could try to use a backtrace, but IME backtracing can be finicky and more of an imprecise dark art than a science

[17:23] <leont> guifa: yeah, I tried using callframe, but didn't get what I wanted

[17:33] <guifa> leont: what’s the use case for detecting it? (just wnodering if there might be another workaround)

[17:34] <guifa> Oof

[17:37] *** dakkar left
[17:37] <guifa> That’s definitely going to be a tough one.  You maybe you can do it by working as a trait instead?

[17:39] <guifa> use POD::Instrospect;     whatev Foo is pod-introspectable { … }

[17:39] <guifa> You’d have to have the use statement on the outside, but I think it might work
