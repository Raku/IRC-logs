[08:39] <Zero_Dogg> Is there any syntax for destructuring a hash based on the left side? Ie. something like my ($a,$b) = %hash; extracting the a and b keys (I know this doesn't work)

[08:50] <tobs> m: my %h = :42a, :80b; my (:$a, :$b) := %h; say $a; say $b

[08:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: «42␤80␤»

[08:51] <tobs> Zero_Dogg: you have to use the binding := operator, then you can destructure just like in signatures

[14:01] <xheimlich> is there a function that takes a function (roughly like collatz-step in the paste) and repeatedly iterates it until some condition like collatz-iter like in https://pastebin.com/7FWvCvYj ?

[14:02] <xheimlich> minus say $n. actually maybe append to a list.

[14:03] <tobs> xheimlich: yes, the sequence operator can do this sort of thing. Just a second

[14:08] <tobs> the construct `17, &f ... $condition` makes a sequence that starts with 17, f(17), f(f(17)), etc. until $condition is satisfied

[14:09] <tobs> (the arity of &f can be greater than one as well, in which case you need enough initial values)

[14:10] <xheimlich> what's the backslash in "my \seq"? 

[14:11] <MasterDuke> just how you create a non-sigiled variable

[14:11] <tobs> it's a sigil-less variable. The sequence operator returns a Seq object and I want to avoid any containers in the way of me iterating that sequence.

[14:13] <tobs> I guess you could have used @seq as well, but I'm not sure if that would have iterated the Seq during assignment (dangerous if the Collatz conjecture is false) or if it would have become a lazy array. The sigil-less seq is definitely lazy.

[14:14] <xheimlich> oh. thanks a lot!

[18:01] <SmokeMachine> just did... and yes, it's broken

[18:01] <SmokeMachine> that's the same error as before I've fixed that...

[18:03] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: sorry, I wasn't with the last master on this machine... it seems to be working here to me...\

[18:05] <xinming_> Yea

[18:05] <SmokeMachine> that worked here to me...

[18:05] <SmokeMachine> could you show me the complete error you are getting, please?

[18:11] <xinming_> I'll try more

[18:15] <xinming_> are a b c placeholder?

[18:15] <SmokeMachine> it mean I want to add that column on the unique constraint a b and c

[18:16] <SmokeMachine> I'm "giving names" to the unique constraints and setting on what constraint the column should apear

[18:17] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: is it possible to do something like, ::?CLASS.add-unique-constraint('name' => {.col1, .col2, .col3}); ??

[18:17] <SmokeMachine> without name

[18:17] <SmokeMachine>  ::?CLASS.add-unique-constraint({.col1, .col2, .col3});

[18:18] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: Thanks, I think I understand that `a b c` means anonymous constriant placeholder.

[18:18] <SmokeMachine> but the idea is accept name in the future

[18:18] <xinming_> we need the name in pg

[18:18] *** Sgeo joined
[18:19] <SmokeMachine> the names aren't being used to anything besides grouping them... but that will be the name of the constraint in the future...
