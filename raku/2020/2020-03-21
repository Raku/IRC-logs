[17:00] <wildtrees> using DBIish and the .prepare and .execute method, how do I pass in array for an insert in a postgres database? the documentation for DBIish doesn't have an example

[17:05] <rbt> I was wondering that yesterday myself.

[17:08] <rbt> Specifically, it would be nice to be able to do: WHERE foo = ANY($1), and pass in an array for $1.

[17:11] <wildtrees> I kind of just want to insert arrays for starters, the documentation is parse

[20:27] <rypervenche> This is probably a stupid question, but up until now I've been using Text::CSV to write a CSV file from an array of hashes. I'd like to change that to an array of objects, although I'm not sure how to do that or even if it's possible. I suppose I could manually create a CSV by simply doing a loop of the array's objects and have it it output the desires attributes into a delimited string. Does anyone

[20:27] <rypervenche> know of a better way to do this? Or if using objects is pointless here?

[20:30] *** pilne left
[20:30] <lizmat> rypervenche: in Raku everything's an object...

[20:31] <rypervenche> lizmat: I just thought it might be more efficient, as you said in your latest talk about how you should be using objects instead of hashes since they were currently faster.

[20:31] *** pilne joined
[20:32] <guifa> For most things yes, but you can always write a .Hash method for your object to create the format needed by Text::CSV

[20:32] <lizmat> if you have a custom class, all you need is to add a .Str method to make it stringify

[20:33] <lizmat> m: class A { multi method Str(A:D:) { "foo" } }; put A.new

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4c026ab83: OUTPUT: Â«fooâ¤Â»

[20:33] <lizmat> the A:D: is to make sure that A.Str will fall back to the default stringification of type objects

[20:35] <rypervenche> Ooooh, I'll do that then. Thank you.

[20:37] <rypervenche> Is there documentation for the the :D: thing anywhere?

[20:37] <guifa> rypervenche: yes, lemme go look it up for you

[20:37] <guifa> basically :D = defined, :U = undefined (type)

[20:38] <guifa> But what lizmat++ was getting at is more than by using A: , you allow for fallbacks

[20:38] <lizmat> and don't forget the multi  :-)

[20:39] <guifa> If you have an undefined A, it wonât match A:D, so it falls back to Mu, and specifically Mu:U if it makes a distinction (dunno if Mu does)

[20:39] <guifa> (Although you could specify an A:D and an A:U if you wanted)

[20:41] <lizmat> m: class A { method Str() { "foo" } }; put A

[20:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4c026ab83: OUTPUT: Â«fooâ¤Â»

[20:42] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a; method Str() { "foo: $!a" } }; put A

[20:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4c026ab83: OUTPUT: Â«Cannot look up attributes in a A type objectâ¤  in method Str at <tmp> line 1â¤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1â¤â¤Â»

[20:42] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a = 42; method Str() { "foo: $!a" } }; put A.new

[20:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4c026ab83: OUTPUT: Â«foo: 42â¤Â»
