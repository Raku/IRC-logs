[10:42] <holyghost> Hi

[10:43] <tyil> o/

[10:43] <holyghost> I've started on Evo::GA on github.com/theholyghost2/p6-evo-ga

[10:43] <holyghost> It's based on emryo devel for genetic algorithms (GA)

[10:44] <holyghost> I'm going to incorporate Von Baer laws in GAs

[10:44] <holyghost> The base classes are almost there

[10:44] <holyghost> Some stuff on NK NKd systems

[10:44] <holyghost> basically it's GAs

[10:44] <holyghost> SFY

[10:47] <holyghost> It's been a whil since I joined but as  I said I'm going to do things on Evo comp.

[10:49] <holyghost> Who's in the steering council now ? elected I mean

[10:51] <holyghost> JJ and liz I presume

[10:51] <tyil> holyghost: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/announcements/20201111.md

[10:53] <holyghost> thx I don't always have access to https. therefor

[10:53] <tyil> ah, I can just paste the names here if you need

[10:54] <holyghost> np, congrats tyil, JJ liz and others

[10:54] * holyghost is just in groupie mode

[10:55] <holyghost> I'm glad everyone is alright in there

[10:55] <holyghost> just some nicks on the page would be great

[10:56] <tyil> I think that can be added

[10:56] <holyghost> .seen Xliff

[10:56] <tellable6> holyghost, I saw Xliff 2020-11-05T08:15:01Z in #raku: <Xliff_> m: my $s; ?$s.say

[10:56] <holyghost> lol

[10:57] <holyghost> I'm going to continue tomorrow on the code, now grabbing a beer

[10:57] <holyghost> It's 100 lines a day with me

[11:00] <holyghost> method mixin($obj, *@roles, :$needs-mixin-attribute)

[11:00] <holyghost> I am probaly needing it for dispatching of emryo interfaces

[11:01] <holyghost> I'm far out on OOP though, I write scheme and list programs most of the time

[12:56] <Altreus> Is there a method like base, except that accepts an alphabet instead of an existing common representation?

[12:56] <Altreus> Real.base I mean

[12:58] *** ufobat__ left
[13:04] <lizmat> wouldn't that just be a .trans on the output of a .base ?

[13:05] <Altreus> mmmmmmaybe? :D

[13:05] <Altreus> lizmat: nope

[13:06] <Altreus> Needs more range

[13:06] <Altreus> there are more than 36 uniquely-shaped glyphs in ascii so I'd like to provide that as the alphabet of "numbers"

[13:08] *** thundergnat joined
[13:08] <Altreus> I mean digits

[13:09] <thundergnat> Altreus: would using a module be ok? Maybe Base::Any would help? (shameless plug)

[13:09] <Altreus> Also kind of surprising that 36 is the limit, when there are common alphabets up to at least 64

[13:09] <Altreus> thundergnat: of course, it's still Perl at heart!

[13:09] <thundergnat> god for up to base 4000+

[13:09] <thundergnat> *good

[13:09] <Altreus> nice

[13:10] <thundergnat> And further with a different representation

[13:11] <thundergnat> also supports negative and imaginary bases for those really obscure needs... 

[13:12] *** thundergnat left
[13:12] <Altreus> thundergnat: Any chance of something like to-base-alphabet('0123456789abcdefghjkmnp') ...

[13:12] <tellable6> Altreus, I'll pass your message to thundergnat

[13:13] <Altreus> I have a feeling there's a spy in here anyway

[16:12] <timotimo> we could emulate that based on data from the colabti irc logs

[16:13] <timotimo> take all the raku/moarvm channels together to calculate an approximation of everyone's activity

[16:13] <[Coke]> reminder to everyone doing presentations, maybe hide your bookmarks bar by default.

[16:13] <timotimo> to balance it a little bit, only make them do the idle message 10 minutes after they last wrote something in channel

[16:13] <[Coke]> (nothing in particular, just seeing everyone's personal bar on their chrome during work presentations)

[16:13] <timotimo> [Coke]: as well as the "start page" of browsers that tends to display either your most visited or just some random recent websites

[16:14] <[Coke]> timotimo++

[16:14] <[Coke]> I have a "presentation mode" batch file for windows that turns on a bunch of things, need to see if I can do the bookmark bar thing from there as well.

[16:14] <timotimo> cool. probably possible to port some of that to linux as well :)

[16:15] <timotimo> you know how mac has a system-wide "dark mode" now? it'd be cool if every program would pay attention to a "presentation mode" kind of toggle as well

[16:15] <timotimo> pie-in-the-sky thinking, though

[16:15] <[Coke]> Yah, zoom doesn't pay attention to the windows setting, which is annoying.

[16:15] <timotimo> which windows setting is that? dark mode?

[16:16] <[Coke]> presentation mode

[16:16] <timotimo> oh i did not know windows has that

[16:17] <timotimo> so no chance for linux to make a brave push for "first operating system with this feature"

[18:25] <Altreus> anyone available to help mw with this? https://github.com/Altreus/Base-Any/tree/alphabet-conversion

[18:25] <Altreus> The problem is exhibited by running t/01-basic.t

[18:25] <Altreus> there's a say at the bottom that makes it go wonky

[18:27] <Altreus> here's some of the relevant bits https://gist.github.com/Altreus/2d3a71fdd7842f3d76c9c61d3afa81ee

[18:28] <lizmat> perhaps an off-by-one in the where { ... } code ?

[18:28] <Altreus> hold on

[18:28] <Altreus> on the one hand yes

[18:28] <Altreus> on the other hand, $threshold is 5

[18:29] <Altreus> why is it sending 4516?

[18:29] <lizmat> I don't know  :-)

[18:29] <Altreus> ok well now it's trying super hard

[18:30] <Altreus> so it was < vs <=, a mistake I *already made*

[18:30] <Altreus> very pesky

[18:30] <Altreus> hrm I'm going to leave real numbers cos I don't understand the code :D

[18:33] <JJAtria[m]> tyil: is there anything I can do to help move https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/pull/978 along?

[18:33] <Altreus> oh look, 4516 happens at a different line

[18:34] <tyil> JJAtria[m]: I've given up on that one for now, feel free to take it over

[18:34] <Altreus> It *does* send it at line 76

[18:34] <Altreus> but it *reports* it at line 137

[18:34] <JJAtria[m]> tyil: Ok, I'll checkout locally and give it a shot

[18:35] <JJAtria[m]> I remember implementing a lexer for rouge in the past, so maybe I still remember some of that

[19:57] <guifa`> Altreus: would be cool to specify a base as a string, where base = $string.chars, and the $string.comb is used as the character array

[20:06] <Altreus> guifa`: yeah, I took it as an array cos you can just do string.comb in your call if you want

[20:07] <Altreus> it works for ints but I can't get my head around the other code

[20:07] <Altreus> the maths is bigger than me

[20:07] <guifa`> Altreus remember though, Raku is about torturing the implementer not the user ;-) 

[20:08] <Altreus> easy to have a multi sub with $alphabet that just calls the other one with $alphabet.comb

[20:12] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to tyil

[20:13] <tyil> melezhik: oh, I thought it was the SHA of the git commit of the module's repo, I may have misread

[20:13] <melezhik> .tell tyil I also fixed "rebuild" feature, now it actually reruns a build 

[20:13] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to tyil

[20:14] <melezhik> @ty

[20:14] <tyil> is there another way to specify the specific commit I want to have tested

[20:14] <tyil> ?

[20:15] <melezhik> tyil if you really need this commit feature for module please create a ticket on https://github.com/melezhik/RakuDist 

[20:15] <melezhik> so, not yet, not now

[20:15] <tyil> alright

[20:15] <melezhik> but I don't think it could be hard to implement ...

[20:16] <melezhik> right now rakudist.raku.or is really slow for me, there is some high load on rakudist worker server right now, already told to rba maybe he knows what happening

[20:17] <melezhik> I've not seen any blin traces last time I checked , usually it was blin jobs that loaded the worker, not the case now ...

[20:18] <melezhik> oh, it's getting slowly better with performance of rakudist worker right now ... )))

[20:23] *** El_Che joined
[20:23] <melezhik> anyway I'd like to announce the feature when if someone want to run the same build they already run, they just need to find and push "rebuild" button, it works now - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melezhik/images/master/rebuild.png

[21:16] <ToddAndMargo> Hi All.  I am looking at https://docs.raku.org/language/variables and am not finding a way to get the absolute path of the program I am running.  ???

[21:17] <tyil> https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-$*PROGRAM

[21:18] <ToddAndMargo> Just found it.  It is $?FILE

[21:20] <ToddAndMargo> $*PROGRAM gives me the relative path. I can see its uses.

[21:24] *** mowcat joined
[21:24] <tyil> well, it gives you an IO::Path

[21:24] <tyil> you can call .absolute on that

[21:24] <MasterDuke> fwiw, you can call `.absolute` on $*PROGRAM. not sure how/when that'd be different from $?FILE

[21:26] <ToddAndMargo> $?FILE is perfect for what I am up to.    `my Str $ReportFile = $?FILE ~ ".tmp";`    I like the .absolute.  I can see its uses too.

[21:30] <ToddAndMargo> Thank you guys!  Bye bye

[22:04] <guifa`> MasterDuke: one is compile time and the other is runtime.  So I guess theoretically the $?FILE could report something differently if precompiled but then moved?

[23:30] <timotimo> yes, it does terminate when the raku program exits

[23:31] <timotimo> to really detach a program you spawn, you'll want something system-dependent. like a double-fork on linux, or nohup, but honestly use a program whose job it is, like systemd, supervisor, dunno, launch it immediately with atd? ;)

[23:35] <timotimo> launch it in a backgrounded tmux session

[23:35] <timotimo> or screen

[23:35] <timotimo> or dtach
