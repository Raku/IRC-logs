[14:07] <moritz> [Coke]: that's false, p6c.org has been gone for over a year

[14:36] *** wamba joined
[14:38] <[Coke]> there is a JVM backend for Rakudo - it is not at full parity to the MoarVM backend. (it's part of the same compiler - just targeting a different backend)

[14:38] <[Coke]> you can build from source. one sec.

[14:39] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo#configuring-rakudo-to-run-on-the-jvm

[14:40] <codesections> Related question, while we're talking about backends: is there a JS backend?  I've seen a couple of references to one, but I'm guessing it's no longer maintained/never really released (based on there not being much info)

[14:41] <jdv79> iirc there's one person that works on the js backend pm...something

[14:41] *** xinming left
[14:42] <eery> afaik you can install it with npm

[14:43] *** xinming joined
[14:45] *** wamba left
[14:45] <codesections> Oh, you know what, there *is* an npm package – but it's still called `perl6-runtime` rather than `raku` as I'd seen in docs previously 

[14:45] <[Coke]> codesections: yes, there is a js backend (it's pmurias)

[14:48] <eery> "npm install raku" and "npm install rakudo" work for me

[14:49] <petr36> Thanks 😊

[14:50] <codesections> good to know.  Thanks :)

[14:51] <eery> but it's erroring out on a hello world raku script, hmmmm

[14:51] <timotimo> https://perl6.github.io/6pad/ - try this

[14:51] <timotimo> it takes a lot of time the first time it loads because rakudo's so big

[14:52] <eery> oh, I think this node is just too ole, nvm

[14:52] <timotimo> rakudo does require support for ... integers of some kind i think?

[14:53] <petr36> Anyone used CommaIde?

[14:54] <petr36> What you think about it?

[14:55] <eery> nqp-runtime uses a function added in node 10, I'm running node 9. I dom't use JS much

[14:56] <[Coke]> moritz: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/blob/master/apache.conf#L7 ?

[15:18] <Grinnz> [Coke]: looks like a problem with the AssetPack plugin setup

[15:21] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Pipe::Sass#DESCRIPTION

[15:21] <Grinnz> i think the error message is that it can't find the 'sass' program

[15:25] <[Coke]> Grinnz: so maybe we should make CSS::Sass a required dep instead of optional?

[15:26] <Grinnz> seems like it would solve that, assuming it can be installed

[15:27] <[Coke]> trying locally

[15:29] *** yangzq50 left
[15:31] <[Coke]> couldn't build CSS::Sass... looks like *it* has an unsatisfied dep...

[17:14] <guifa2> For module stuff, is there any way for a named parameter during 'use' to take a value different than true?

[17:14] <SmokeMachine> does %?RESOURCES exists on tests?

[17:15] <[Coke]> rakudo.org site isn't getting updated automatically, which may explain why the new release isn't on the front page yet

[17:15] <guifa2> e.g. "use Ops::Custom :substract<less> :add<plus>; my $a = 2 plus 2;" ?

[17:16] <guifa2> SmokeMachine: yes

[17:16] <guifa2> err, well it depends

[17:17] <SmokeMachine> I'm not being able to use that. :(

[17:17] <guifa2> do you mean can you access resources by using %?RESOURCES?  or will %?RESOURCES be available in the module files?

[17:17] <SmokeMachine> access %?RESOURCES<some/file>

[17:18] <[Coke]> guifa2: see https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Exporting_and_selective_importing

[17:19] <guifa2> [Coke]: yeah, I'm reading that, but it says that the named arguments just pull in what's in the package EXPORT::named-arg, it doesn't look like there's a way to pass in the value of the named arg

[17:20] <[Coke]> no, I think you might have to predeclare for normal stuff.

[17:20] <SmokeMachine> guifa2: I do something like that here: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red.pm6#L69

[17:20] <[Coke]> use lib does it somehow, though. one sec.

[17:21] <SmokeMachine> but with positional parameters

[17:22] <guifa2> SmokeMachine: ah, then no.  Because the test file is being run external to the module (just like any other script would be run).  You could probably make a hidden option that exports a sub like "resources-for-test-purposes-only ($filename) { %?RESOURCES{$filename} }" if it's crucial for testing.

[17:23] <SmokeMachine> guifa2: thanks

[17:23] <guifa2> One thing I did for a test file that needed a data file was to include it in a directory in the t/ directory.  E.g., t/01-test-foo.t, and then t/01-test-foo/data.bar

[17:24] <[Coke]> ah, use lib has special code in do_pragma.

[17:25] <guifa2> [Coke]: boo.  that would be kind of cool if it could be passed via a special dynamic var @*ARGS or something.  Obviously packages don't have signatures

[19:45] <guifa2> (I actually use that character regularly so it's one I think a lot about hahaha)

[19:48] <guifa2> Also, for as much as I *love* Raku's string handling (being grapheme based), it makes doing some things a bit trickier when algorithms are designed around codepoints instead

[19:48] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Game::Covid19 (0.0.3) by 03ELIZABETH

[19:49] <lizmat> guifa: https://docs.raku.org/type/Uni  ??

[19:50] <ShimmerFairy> The biggest deficiency in non-Str strings at the moment is that you can't do regexes on them, but worst case you can "just" do something like / [ :m (a) { mess with ~$0 } ] /

[19:51] * guifa2 was about to type something but, what what ShimmerFairy said.   Regex :-(

[19:52] <guifa2> The <local-alpha> token has some stuff that allows for a bare combining mark.  I'm still debating the best ways to handle those cases (that aren't very edge case for languages like Hebrew and Arabic).  But it's in the middle of a token so I've got to do a Str -> codepoints conversion 

[19:53] <ShimmerFairy> For example, I had to parse double-quote strings in my .XCompose file, which can start with diacritics that merge with the ", but I managed that with [ :m (<["]>) { my @codes = (~$0).NFC.list; ... } ]

[19:54] *** HarmtH left
[19:54] <lucs> lizmat: Different game, also covid-19 inspired :-) : http://juliasfairies.com/articles/pandemic-fairy-condition-leroux/

[19:54] <guifa2> I think for the most part, it will catch people making modules, and that's fine by me.  Module authors are generally more aware of these implementation details and deal with them accordingly

[19:55] <ShimmerFairy> Years ago I proposed adverbs that would let you do that same task as  [ :nfc '"' ~ '"' <-["]>+ ]  instead, but it's a pretty rare thing to come up so it's not in the language (yet?). (So far, only that one time have I needed to step outside of NFG)

The only thing I'm not convinced on is how to return a match of 'a' when the matched character is 'á'.  My instinct is to reject the match outright but I dunno. I need to play around with ICU more to see how they handle it

[20:19] <ShimmerFairy> m: say "á" ~~ m:m/a/

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90f86d4c9: OUTPUT: «｢á｣␤»

[20:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90f86d4c9: OUTPUT: «a␤»

[20:23] <ShimmerFairy> Assuming samemark handles the rare extended grapheme cluster with prepended combining characters, that would be the better approach.

[22:31] <jdoege> Howdy all. Pursuant to my questions the other day about Rakudo Star, is there a list somewhere of what modules were included with Rakudo Star? The link that should lead to a page with such a list returns a 404.

[22:33] <lizmat> jdoege: I'm not sure, but I'm afraid all people who could answer this, are currently sleeping or on their way to sleep

[22:34] <lizmat> I know I am, but I don't have answer  :-(
