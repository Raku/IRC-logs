[10:05] <Altai-man_> >alpine builds fine

[10:05] <Altai-man_> phew

[10:05] <Altai-man_> doing this was very worrisome. :S

[10:06] *** Redfoxmoon left
[10:06] <El_Che> Altai-man_: thank you

[10:07] <El_Che> Altai-man_: I spent whole a whole evening last week trying different incantation of CFLAGS and failed

[10:07] <El_Che> Altai-man_: what di you do? revert the changes in the upstream lib?

[10:07] <Altai-man_> El_Che, thanks for trying out this! Too bad it didn't worked well.

[10:08] <El_Che> Altai-man_: dealing with failure is something you learn in IT :)

[10:09] <Altai-man_> El_Che, well, we got a fix from the maintainer, it was merged to our fork. Then I got back to 2020.02, cherry-picked the fix for moarvm (and did bumping to 2020.02.1 for nqp/rakudo) and did the same release process as normally in a point mode.

[10:10] <Altai-man_> what I was afraid of is that 2020.02.1 tag was set on a branch a week old and a cherry-pick&release commits, so was really not sure if it'll break MOAR_VERSION/NQP_VERSION-dependant pulling. Hopefully it was Sunday and nobody commited anything so I could bump things back to actual master commit.

[10:11] <Altai-man_> And it builds fine for me now from master, so I hope nobody from core devs got failures caused by me. :S

[10:12] *** Poohman left
[10:14] <El_Che> I am on the edge to "rm -f t/08-performance/99-misc.t" for i386 builds

[10:14] <El_Che> it fails most of the time

[10:14] *** Redfoxmoon joined
[10:15] <El_Che> shoud I bump threaholds of the test with a PR? Or just ignore it by not running a test that's ill fitted for arch that are not amd64?

[10:17] <El_Che> rwe already bumped the margin in jule and august 2019

[10:17] <Altai-man_> El_Che, I'd say open a ticket and don't run it to build packages.

[10:17] <Altai-man_> maybe it got slower and that's something we want to fix then

[10:18] <El_Che> nine added %*ENV<RAKUDO_SKIP_TIMING_TESTS>

[10:18] <El_Che> to work around it

[10:40] <lizmat> El_Che: do you haz a link already ?

[10:41] <El_Che> lizmat: they will be here: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg, but more people use repos

[14:09] <Altai-man_> Altreus, what can I help you with?

[14:10] *** wamba left
[14:10] <Altreus> Altai-man_: repository information exists in META6.json but is not used to link the docs page to the repo https://modules.raku.org/dist/ObjectCache:cpan:ELIZABETH 

[14:10] *** wamba joined
[14:10] <Altreus> It was trivial to open up META6.json and use the link therein, but quality of life etc

[14:11] <Altai-man_> Altreus, what do you mean, source-url?

[14:11] <Altai-man_> Altreus, there is a button, right to the name

[14:12] <Altai-man_> near "last updated on 2020-03-02"

[14:12] <Altreus> oh that's what that means

[14:12] <Altreus> I assumed that was a permalink to this page, since it uses the CPAN icon

[14:12] <Altreus> quite what logo generically means "source", however...

[14:12] <Altreus> anyway, cool! Thanks :)

[14:13] <Altai-man_> hmmm

[14:13] <Altai-man_> e.g. https://modules.raku.org/dist/zef:cpan:UGEXE has both "dist source" pointing to git and "dist repository" pointing to github

[14:13] <Altai-man_> so "dist source" is taken from source-url there

[14:14] <Altai-man_> this seems like there are some issues in website code which does processing, I think

[14:14] <Altai-man_> the sources are at https://github.com/Raku/modules.raku.org

[14:14] <Altreus> github comes from support->bugtracker, it seems

[14:14] <Altai-man_> Altreus, I wonder if that's "smart enough" to cut this `/issues` part, really

[14:14] <Altreus> maybe the semantics of the key, and not the value, should be used

[14:15] <Altai-man_> and bugtracker is bugtracker

[14:15] <Altai-man_> anyway, the sources are there, but I am not going to touch it, have zero knowledge of perl. :(

[14:15] <Altreus> :)

[14:15] <Altreus> In my experience, knowledge of perl is woefully insufficient to do any work on a perl repository
