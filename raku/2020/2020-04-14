[05:28] <bartolin_> [Coke]: (removing unused and jvm specific opcodes) I think that those could be removed. (In the case of sayfh it seems to be a leftover from the nqp-io overhaul in 2017: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/commit/05e5d75c72)

[18:25] <El_Che> I am struggling to match $b when it's a named param

[18:25] <El_Che> m: my $s = :($pos, :$b); say ('a', '--b=foo') ~~ $s

[18:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 43c7e96f9: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[18:25] <El_Che> m: my $s = :($pos, :$b); say ('a', ('b' => 'foo')) ~~ $s

[18:26] <El_Che> @args is in the form of ('a', '--b=foo'), so I need to rewrited @args before I can use smartmatch?

[18:29] <El_Che> I guess I answered my own question, but good to check if there is a better way

[18:36] <[Coke]> If you're trying to do something based on passed in args, I do that by having multiple MAINs

[18:36] <[Coke]> would that be a possibility for what you're trying?

[18:40] <El_Che> [Coke]: I am rewriting MAIN behind the curtains

[18:40] <El_Che> [Coke]: hopefully the module will be out soon :)

[18:51] <El_Che> my test needed a pair of extra parens: say "MATCH: " ~ (@args-pairs ~~ $sig);

[19:03] <[Coke]> .ask bartolin_ so, printfh is slightly more used, it's made it into the stage-N snapshots. It's probably still removable, though.

[19:03] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to bartolin_

[19:34] <chloekek> CRAI got a fresh new look (and implementation, and correctly sorting version numbers): https://crai.foldr.nl/search?q=P5

[19:34] <chloekek> And a dark theme but it doesn‚Äôt have a button to switch yet.

[19:40] <El_Che> I created a small module to augment MAIN(), if anyway wants to give it a go it would be nice: https://github.com/nxadm/SuperMAIN

[19:40] <El_Che> It add features to MAIN() that I missed, while keeping the MAIN() syntax en semantics

[20:06] <bbkr> RakuAST video by @jnthn is awesome: - I don't have an audience here, so I actually have to think up the questions. (...) - What about memory use? - That's a really good question!

[20:06] <bbkr> it made my day :)

[20:55] <jjatria> I also just finished watching the RakuAST video, and I really liked it! For me, it also answered the really basic question of "why do we even want these for", and now I'm a convert. jnthn++
