[13:44] <RaycatWhoDat> Hello. I have a question about the `polymod` routine. 

[13:45] <RaycatWhoDat> So, the way I understand it is: you can provide units like 60 seconds, 60 minutes, and so on

[13:45] <RaycatWhoDat> and it will return the appropriate result in a list

[13:46] <RaycatWhoDat> p6: 14282.polymod(10, 100, 1000, 10000).say;

[13:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4103a3095: OUTPUT: «(2 28 14 0 0)␤»

[13:46] <RaycatWhoDat> Why doesn't it return 1 for the 10k place here?

[13:46] <timotimo> they are "cumulative"

[13:46] <tellable6> 2020-05-23T12:56:52Z #raku-dev <lizmat> timotimo if you want to see an exploding --profile, try running "IO::Spec::Unix.tmpdir for ^10000"

[13:46] <timotimo> m: say 111112222333445.polymod(10, 100, 1000, 10000)

[13:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4103a3095: OUTPUT: «(5 44 333 2222 11111)␤»

[13:47] <RaycatWhoDat> I think you lost me.

[13:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Like, I see what it's doing now but I can't explain why that is

[13:48] <timotimo> m: say 14282.polymod(10, 10, 10, 10, 10)

[13:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4103a3095: OUTPUT: «(2 8 2 4 1 0)␤»

[13:48] <timotimo> you don't multiply them yourself

[13:48] <RaycatWhoDat> OH

[13:48] <RaycatWhoDat> I get it

[13:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Thanks for helping me through it

[18:45] *** guifa2 left
[18:45] <Dwarf> My regex is a thing of arguable beauty and it's functional so I can't complain

[18:46] <Dwarf> Matching something such as 's/foo/bar/g' with rx/ 's/' [(<-[/]>+) '/'] ** 2 (g)?/ should do the trick, but suggestions are welcome

[18:47] <timotimo> you'll want to handle backslashed slashes, quoted slashes, and different starter characters as well :)

[18:48] <lizmat> weekly: https://raku-musings.com/ipv4-product.html

[18:48] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[18:48] <timotimo> oh this is not raku regex, right?

[18:48] <timotimo> since the g doesn't go at the end for raku

[18:49] <Dwarf> It should match "good old" basic sed syntax to a degree

[18:51] <timotimo> sed does support different starter characters

[18:51] <timotimo> like s,foo,bar,

[18:52] <Dwarf> It's just for an IRC bot so it shouldn't need to be so advanced I hope

[19:08] <mahafyi> suggestion to core team: You could add a bounty program and consultant listing in raku site. you'd have at least one user, lol.

[23:41] <RaycatWhoDat> Got another question

[23:41] <RaycatWhoDat> "Use of Nil in string context"

[23:42] <RaycatWhoDat> Both variables are defined either before or on the loop declaration

[23:42] <RaycatWhoDat> Additionally, it still outputs what I want, so I'm a bit confused.

[23:43] * lucs tries to guess what the code is... No luck :)

[23:44] <RaycatWhoDat> Sorry, I was in the midst of uploading it, haha

[23:44] <RaycatWhoDat> https://gist.github.com/RayMPerry/cf0d91b0858902a09673bd9f193a2db4

[23:45] <RaycatWhoDat> Error fires on Line 9

[23:46] <lucs> Ah. What you want is  ^4  (0, 1, 2, 3)

[23:47] <lucs> Well, looking at line 9 anyway, that's what it looks like.

[23:47] <RaycatWhoDat> oh, yeah, that did it

[23:47] <RaycatWhoDat> huh

[23:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Somehow, I expected a out-of-bounds error to look different

[23:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Thanks!

[23:49] <timotimo> with non-shaped arrays you can actually assign to what you get out of the array to resize is

[23:49] <lucs> You're welcome.

[23:49] <lucs> cameeeelia?

[23:49] <timotimo> c: my @foo = 1, 2, 3; @foo[9] = 1000; dd @foo

[23:49] <committable6> timotimo, ¦my: «Cannot find this revision (did you mean “nom”?)»

[23:50] <timotimo> c: HEAD my @foo = 1, 2, 3; @foo[9] = 1000; dd @foo

[23:50] <committable6> timotimo, ¦HEAD(4a728f2): «Array @foo = [1, 2, 3, Any, Any, Any, Any, Any, Any, 1000]␤»

[23:50] <timotimo> m: my @foo[9]; @foo[$_].say for ^20

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a728f2ad: OUTPUT: «(Any)␤Index 9 for dimension 1 out of range (must be 0..8)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤(Any)␤»

[23:52] * lucs accidentally did "/msg camelia: ..." (with a trailing colon), whence the confusion.

[23:53] <RaycatWhoDat> Ah, I see.

[23:53] <RaycatWhoDat> So, my array was non-shaped and that's why it didn't throw that error?

[23:53] <RaycatWhoDat> my List*
