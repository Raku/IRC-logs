[08:35] <plant_enjoyer> hi, https://docs.raku.org/type/Channel#sub_await says "Since 6.d, it no longer blocks a thread while waiting." - what does it mean exactly?

[08:35] <plant_enjoyer> if it waits, it blocks - no?

[08:36] <moritz> plant_enjoyer: it means it waits, but the thread pool scheduler can still use the thread for other things while it waits

[08:36] <plant_enjoyer> moritz: oh. but as the end user, I don't care about this, do I?

[08:37] <plant_enjoyer> I mean I won't see this unless I do some unsafe stuff

[08:37] <moritz> plant_enjoyer: well, if this weren't the case, you could run into thread starvation if you do many awaits at once

[08:38] <plant_enjoyer> moritz: oh right, I can see how. nice :) thanks for explaining

[08:39] <jmerelo> There are not so many repos (at least that I can see) in travis-ci.org, but still we need to organize migration https://travis-ci.com/search/Raku

[15:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´[{:a(1), :b(2)},]‚ê§¬ª

[15:52] <Zero_Dogg> Okay, so. I don't quite get why that does what it does. I would expect the array to contain a signle element, a hash with the keys a and b, instead it contains two elements. I know something is just clashing with perl knowledge I'm trying to bring over, but I don't quite get what

[15:52] <Zero_Dogg> interesting. So without the comma, it's flattening it?

[15:52] <timotimo> it's the same mechanism that makes [<a b c d e f>] give you an array of 6 elements

[15:53] <timotimo> assigning to an array will iterate the outermost thing on the RHS to get elements

[15:53] <Zero_Dogg> aha

[15:53] <timotimo> m: my @array_one = <hello how are you>; my @array_two = @array_one; dd @array_one, @array_two;

[15:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´Array @array_one = ["hello", "how", "are", "you"]‚ê§Array @array_two = ["hello", "how", "are", "you"]‚ê§¬ª

[15:53] <timotimo> same reason the array_two has the same number of elements as array_one, rather than being an array with a single array as its first element

[15:54] <Zero_Dogg> right. What was confusing me was that @array.push did the right thing. I think I get it now though, the trailing comma makes it a list of hashes, while leaving it out iterates over a single hash to build array elements

[15:55] <MasterDuke> single arg rule

[16:02] *** matiaslina joined
[16:02] <timotimo> right, push is for "pushing a single thing", whereas you use "append" to push multiple things, in which case the one-argument-rule would kick in again

[16:03] <timotimo> m: my @a = 1, 2; @a.push([4, 5]); @a.append(9, 8, 7); @a.append(["a", "b", "c"]); dd @a

[16:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´Array @a = [1, 2, [4, 5], 9, 8, 7, "a", "b", "c"]‚ê§¬ª

[16:03] <timotimo> here we have append be called with three individual arguments, and called with an array of three elements, those are handled the same thanks to the single argument rule

[16:05] <Zero_Dogg> Okay, it makes sense now, I just wasn't aware of it. That's quite handy.

[16:05] <timotimo> aye, it's a thing that tends to Get People

[16:05] <timotimo> m: my @a; @a[0][0][0][0][0] = "yo"; dd @a

[16:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´Array @a = [[[[["yo"],],],],]‚ê§¬ª

[16:06] <timotimo> ^- thankfully when you have a nested array with single elements, outputting it with the .raku method like dd does it will show you that

[18:07] <Grinnz> jmerelo: also note https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing

[18:08] <Grinnz> you may want to start looking into github actions

[18:10] <jmerelo> Grinnz: not a big fan of Github actions. But we're covered in that area, fortunately.

[18:10] <Grinnz> unfortunately, travis seems to be giving up the ghost

[18:11] <jmerelo> Grinnz: it says we will have 1000 minutes in a Linux environment. But I'm not totally sure whose plan will that be. If it's per organization, well, we're f*cked.

[18:12] <jmerelo> If it's per submitter, we're also f*cked, maybe a bit less.

[18:12] <Grinnz> it does say OSS projects can request more, which is not very hopeful

[18:12] <jmerelo> Grinnz: got to try anyway

[18:16] <jmerelo> Grinnz: do you understand 10k credits is per month? Or that's all you've got?

[18:16] <Grinnz> yes i believe it's per month

[18:19] <jmerelo> Grinnz: these are all the repos in Raku https://travis-ci.com/github/Raku Just a few of them are really active. Every build in Raku/doc is 7 minutes.

[18:19] <jmerelo> Grinnz: if that's the case, I think we're safe for now.

[18:20] <jmerelo> Grinnz: Uf, no, we're f*cked https://travis-ci.com/github/Raku?tab=insights it's 2k minutes per month.

[18:30] <vZS1> I wouldn't tie in too much with GitHub if I were you. Look what they did to youtube-dl.

[18:30] <jmerelo> Someone should do the same for the Rakudo and MoarVM organizations, although they're probably far away from the limit and they're using alternatives anyway.

[18:30] *** BinGOs left
[18:30] <jmerelo> vZS1: that's also an issue. 

[18:30] <Grinnz> if you don't want to be dependent on an org for CI you have to host your own

[18:30] <jmerelo> We're good with raku-community-modules. We've spen... 5 mins in the last month.

[18:30] <vZS1> GitHub is no longer what it used to be after the Microsoft takeover

[18:30] *** domidumont left
[18:31] <Grinnz> such as circle ci

[18:31] <jmerelo> vZS1: Github actions is certainly something with great potential. But their support for it is totally dismal.

[18:32] <jmerelo> Grinnz: we do use Circle CI for documentation. We regularly run out of minutes there.

[18:34] <vZS1> I use Got hooks on my own hosts for everything. Relying on these companies for critical infrastructure is a bad idea.

[18:34] <vZS1> Self-hoated GitLab is also a good solution that requires less work.

[18:35] <vZS1> Git hooks*

[18:35] <vZS1> Self-hosted*

[18:37] <vZS1> GitLab has declarative workflows for build and test automation.

[18:38] <vZS1> You'll save money in the long run as well.

[18:40] <jmerelo> But we would need to host everything at GitLab. Move issues. PR history. Not a good idea.

[18:40] <jmerelo> self-hosting is not sustainable. At the end of the day, somebody's got to pay the electric bill.

[18:41] *** ufobat left
[18:41] <jmerelo> Raku is not a company or a thing. We need to rely on those free resources, those that need the least amount of support.

[18:41] *** guifa joined
[18:42] <Grinnz> right

[18:42] <jmerelo> Travis a pretty good deal anyway. I've requested some more credits; Raku is a good case for getting more of them. Don't think it will be a problem.

[18:43] *** bingos joined
[18:43] <jmerelo> We need to spin off some tests, anyway, to other services. The less we spend in a single place, the better.

[18:43] <vZS1> Do what you think works for Raku but you already see the issues with migration from these solutions. They coax users towards vendor lock-in.

[18:44] <vZS1> PR being a great example

[18:44] <vZS1> And other "integrations"

[18:46] <vZS1> Then something like the youtube-dl disaster happens and a project is caught with its pants down.

[18:46] *** bingos is now known as BinGOs

[18:47] <Grinnz> you either host things yourself (not possible in cases like this as mentioned) or you lock into *something* - all you can do is account for the possibility that the service will be lost at some point

[18:47] <Grinnz> fortunately for the git repo itself the backup plan is very easy

[18:50] <jmerelo> Grinnz: well, issues and PRs can be backed up if needed too, via API. We already retrieved the tickets in RT and uploaded them to GitHub

[18:50] <vZS1> It is perfectly possible to self-host a  project of Raku's scale. And it's not as costly as some would lead to believe. New CPUs like Ryzen consume very little wattage

[18:51] <jmerelo> But I don't see self-hosting as a viable option. Even if, let's say, Primark came and said "Here's your hosting, or unlimited cloud credit", you would still be have problems.

[18:51] <jmerelo> Person needed to maintain them, upgrades, security... And you would need to work with Jenkins or GitLab or whatever, which would you lock in in yet another way.

[18:52] <vZS1> Depends on how much of a priority self-sufficiency is.

[18:53] <jmerelo> vZS1: priority is using human resources wisely. Migrating to a new infrastructure (self-hosted or whatever) and then needing human resources to tend to it, well, it's exactly the opposite of self-sufficient.

[18:53] <jmerelo> There's no such thing as self-hosted with 0 maintenance. Even hosted elsewhere needs a certain amount of maintenance.

[18:54] <vZS1> Self-sufficiency is not efficiency

[18:54] <vZS1> Two different things

[18:54] <jmerelo> I mean, push comes to shove, we might need to move to GitLab. But someone would have to make a pretty big case (and put a good amount of resources on the table) for that to happen.

[18:55] <jmerelo> And I'm not even talking about self-hosted gitlab... 

[18:56] <vZS1> Just remember you get all these things free now as long as it's profitable for these companies to provide you these things.

[18:58] <vZS1> Having a migration solution ready is important. I love the language you provide. That's why I don't want to see it get a wrench thrown in its supporting infrastructure.

[18:59] <jmerelo> Don't think it would be good optics for them to shut down an open source outfit. Even if it's a small one.

[18:59] <jmerelo> vZS1: we already had a wrench thrown throughout all the 1 single computer offered by moritz that went bust

[19:00] <jmerelo> vZS1: we survived through it, and not there's one person in charge of infra. There's no way out of that; we need infra to host websites. You can't run a language from GitHub pages.

[19:01] <vZS1> Don't you have a mirror host?

[19:01] <jmerelo> Now infra is pretty stable, but rba++ needs to devote some time and money to that. But we needed the wrench. We would have happily continued there.

[19:02] <jmerelo> vZS1: there's nothing in production that's not in a repo. Precisely that's one of the differences with current infra, before there were lots of hacks in production that were impossible to reproduce.

[19:02] <jmerelo> vZS1: they were nice hacks, and used a lot of ingenuity. But you can't reproduce ingenuity. That's why today's infra is a bit more robust, and (mostly) reproducible.

[19:03] <vZS1> But that's not a shortcoming of running your own infrastructure. Reproducibility can be done on premise or cloud

[19:03] <vZS1> Look at things like Ansible, Docker, etc.

[19:03] <jmerelo> No, it's not. My point is that we did it because we had no other way out. CI is a different thing altogether. We have CI scripts running all over the place.

[19:04] <jmerelo> Travis is the biggest bunch, probably. But there are all kinds of them. Moving all of them to... whatever: pretty big deal. Moving Travis to whatever... well, just a big deal.

[19:05] <jmerelo> While it's probably a good idea to phase it out in favor of... Anything else, I wouldn't ask for everyone in the 5? organizations to do it now.

[19:06] <jmerelo> Let me see: there's (legacy) perl6, but pretty much nothing is running there now. Raku, with docs being the biggest thing. raku-community-modules (but just 6 minutes spent last month, not a lot is happening there).

[19:06] <jmerelo> Then Rakudo and MoarVM

[19:07] <vZS1> CI is a bit tricky because unless you built it yourself to be easy to move right at the start it's always going to be painful to try something else later. No easy answer for that.

[19:07] <jmerelo> So best thing is to channel our best puss-in-boots-big-eyes face and ask for more minutes from Travis. Concurrently, try and see what's done there that can be done elsewhere, so that we don't need to rely so much on them.

[19:08] <jmerelo> I mean, those are just my 2‚Ç¨cents.

[19:11] <vZS1> How many minutes of CI do you use per month?

[19:13] *** lichtkind joined
[19:15] *** mid_home left
[19:17] <Zero_Dogg> There's also gitlab, their CI is quite good, and offers 50 000 minutes per month for FOSS-projects

[19:17] *** camelCaser left
[19:18] <Zero_Dogg> they've got some hooks for working with github repos too, I think

[19:18] <jmerelo> vZS1: 2250 in the case of the Raku organization. Most are for docs, but there are other projects. Raku/documentable, for instance.

[19:18] <jmerelo> Zero_Dogg: really?

[19:18] <vZS1> The CI market is incredibly saturated right now. There's no shortage of YAML-based alternatives.

[19:19] <jmerelo> Hum, didn't know that https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/github/ thanks, Zero_Dogg 

[19:20] <Zero_Dogg> :)

[19:20] <jmerelo> Zero_Dogg: needs a silver-premium plan https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ Do you know where we can apply for that?

[19:21] <Zero_Dogg> jmerelo: FOSS projects get gold for free - https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/join/

[19:22] <vZS1> I think you get some free credits for Google cloud as well if you try the kubernetes integration for GitLab. I don't know if that's still around or not.

[19:23] <vZS1> Last time I checked was a few months ago

[19:23] *** camelCaser joined
[19:24] <jmerelo> Zero_Dogg: thanks! Applying

[19:31] <jmerelo> Zero_Dogg: OK, applied on behalf of the whole community.

[19:31] <vZS1> You could look into IPFS as well if you would like to make it simple for people to mirror the webpages Raku has.

[19:32] <jmerelo> Still waiting for the answer from Travis

[19:32] <jmerelo> vZS1: all pages are in GitHub. For instance, documentation is at https://rakudocs.github.io. Most of them are static, too.

[19:32] <perryprog> Worth noting that Gitlab reduced the free tier of CI/CD to have 400 minutes from 2000 minutes, not sure if this applies here

[19:37] <vZS1> Be a bit careful with GitLab. Last time I used it I couldn't "nest" variables properly. Would throw some random behaviour at me. Don't know if they fixed that yet or not.

[19:38] <vZS1> Let me try to find the issue

[19:38] <vZS1> Sec

[19:38] *** orinthe1 left
[19:39] <jmerelo> perryprog: at the end of the day, every one of them are not charities. They're private companies. Sticking to just one of them is not a good long-term strategy

[19:39] <vZS1> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/1809

[19:40] <jmerelo> perryprog: but for the time being we are not using GitLab, except for Rakudo Star, I think.

[19:40] <vZS1> It's been open for 4 years now üòÇ

[19:40] <vZS1> And I like how they call it a "feature request" instead of a bug. Lol

[19:41] <jmerelo> Well, it been a nice while, but it's dinner time around here. Don't stay up late while they count the ballots. See you tomorrow!

[19:41] <vZS1> Have a good night.

[20:06] <Zero_Dogg> perryprog: doesn't apply here, it's for private projects/repos. Public ones get 50 000 minutes.
