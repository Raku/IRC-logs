[02:14] <softmoth> Is there any way to save common command-line options (in a Signature?) and then slip them into several MAIN multis? Like my \common  := :(:v(:$verbose), :d(:$doc), :n(:$nopager))); multi MAIN(|common  #`(doesn't work), $query) { ... }

[02:21] *** MilkmanDan left
[02:27] <guifa> softmoth: unfortunately, no.  Maybe a work around could be to use dynamic variables and redispatching

[02:27] <guifa> ACtually, if you build up the method via metaprogramming, you might be able to, but taht‚Äôs super overkill

[02:29] <softmoth> Sure, it's a lot uglier than copying the variables, probably. I am hoping to have $*USAGE be usable, so I'll just try to format the text to be easy to cut-n-paste any updates.

[02:29] <softmoth> Thank you!

[02:29] <guifa> That said, one little trick that I‚Äôve learned wrt dynamics

[02:29] <guifa> You can define a dynamic in the signature, so it autopropogates, for lack of a better term

[02:30] <guifa> multi MAIN ($*first, $*second) {¬†samewith :redispatched }

[02:31] <guifa> you could then have something like multi MAIN (:redispatched!) {¬†$*first + $*second }

[02:31] <guifa> at least I think samewith will pass aong dynams

[02:42] <softmoth> I guess ¬°macros! will make it easy. :-D

[19:16] <JJMerelo> "Going to" is the key word here

[19:17] <JJMerelo> But I don't really know when. I guess the current print run will have to be substantially sold before that happens.

[19:17] <JJMerelo> The book finished production pretty much at the same time the name change was being decided.

[21:28] <softmoth> Ah, thanks for that pointer. I'll try to get around to it soon.

[21:29] <hoelzro> and if they haven't been updated in 6 years for Raku, I'm sure refreshing them would be immensely helpful =)
