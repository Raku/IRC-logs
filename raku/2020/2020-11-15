[00:48] <MitarashiDango[m> I don't know about rakudo-star itself, but it seems /usr/share/perl6/site/bin is empty on the Docker image D:

[00:52] <timotimo> that's where modules get installed to, isn't it?

[00:52] <timotimo> i mean, the binary scripts from modules

[00:52] <MitarashiDango[m> Yup

[00:53] <timotimo> you're expecting to find zef in there?

[00:53] *** dog_star left
[00:55] <MitarashiDango[m> Yeah zef, prove6 etc

[00:55] <timotimo> i haven't used the docker image in ages :|

[00:57] <MitarashiDango[m> I think there might be something wrong with the 2020.10 star tar, there's no Configure.pl

[00:59] <timotimo> wow, whoops

[00:59] <timotimo> where did you grab it from?

[01:00] <MitarashiDango[m> https://rakudo.org/dl/star/rakudo-star-2020.10.tar.gz

[01:01] <timotimo> yeah that looks like a tar ball from the repository that has the tools to build a rakudo star release

[01:01] <timotimo> not an actual rakudo star release

[01:02] <MitarashiDango[m> I think 2020.05 might also be the same

[01:03] <MitarashiDango[m> 2020.01 looks to be fine though

[11:26] <tib> Hello, I have a strange behaviour playing with arrays append and array copy. "Strange" because I don't understand :D and it is even not the same behaviour depending the run. Tested on my computer with raku 2020.10 and on repl.it. 

[11:26] <tib> I'm a beginner, so maybe I'm doing something totally wrong 

[11:26] <tib> Here is the code : https://gist.github.com/thibaultduponchelle/2e30d38f71292581b00cbae76c62a10c

[12:34] *** frost-lab left
[12:42] <MitarashiDango[m> tib: I highly suspect the binding is the culprit `@a := @b`, but I don't know enough about bindings to give you a decent explanation. I suspect using `@a = @b` instead should solve the problem (which should actually copy the array, rather than making @a and @b the same thing), and hopefully someone else can chime in on the why.

[13:03] <tobs> tib: I suspect a bug. On my system I get growing arrays up until around size 400 or so and then both are constant 2.

[13:04] <tobs> running it with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 has both grow up to 1000 elements, as, I think, intended

[13:04] <tobs> tib: I think that's enough evidence for a bug report.

[15:01] <MitarashiDango[m> I don't quite understand the behaviour of a trailing declarator block (#=) on attributes. It gets confusing if you have a conditional default. For example, if you give the attribute a default via a ternary operator, the #= has to come before the semicolon: https://repl.it/@mienaikage/WorthlessBelovedScandisk

[15:02] <MitarashiDango[m> Similar behaviour if you do something like = do if {...}

[19:39] <MasterDuke> i believe they'll compile faster as a single file, but that's a compiler implementation thing, not a language thing

[19:41] <guifa> And for a module thatâs goign to be precompiled anyways, probably not an issue either

[19:43] <guifa> I have several dozen little subclasses for the different CLDR elements, and now that Iâve started adding serialization code and have to special handle them all, each class is starting to get rather unwieldy

[19:43] <guifa> So I think Iâm goign to break them up, which should probably help me in producing cleaner documentation for them anyways

[20:43] <guifa> rir: I donât think you can tell per se from a script.  Rakudo star is a just a distribution that includes MoarVM, Rakudo, and some key modules.  I guess you could check the version/build numbers of each and reasonably determine it, knowing each star releaseâs info
