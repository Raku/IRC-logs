[00:48] <MitarashiDango[m> I don't know about rakudo-star itself, but it seems /usr/share/perl6/site/bin is empty on the Docker image D:

[00:52] <timotimo> that's where modules get installed to, isn't it?

[00:52] <timotimo> i mean, the binary scripts from modules

[00:52] <MitarashiDango[m> Yup

[00:53] <timotimo> you're expecting to find zef in there?

[00:53] *** dog_star left
[00:55] <MitarashiDango[m> Yeah zef, prove6 etc

[00:55] <timotimo> i haven't used the docker image in ages :|

[00:57] <MitarashiDango[m> I think there might be something wrong with the 2020.10 star tar, there's no Configure.pl

[00:59] <timotimo> wow, whoops

[00:59] <timotimo> where did you grab it from?

[01:00] <MitarashiDango[m> https://rakudo.org/dl/star/rakudo-star-2020.10.tar.gz

[01:01] <timotimo> yeah that looks like a tar ball from the repository that has the tools to build a rakudo star release

[01:01] <timotimo> not an actual rakudo star release

[01:02] <MitarashiDango[m> I think 2020.05 might also be the same

[01:03] <MitarashiDango[m> 2020.01 looks to be fine though

[11:26] <tib> Hello, I have a strange behaviour playing with arrays append and array copy. "Strange" because I don't understand :D and it is even not the same behaviour depending the run. Tested on my computer with raku 2020.10 and on repl.it. 

[11:26] <tib> I'm a beginner, so maybe I'm doing something totally wrong 

[11:26] <tib> Here is the code : https://gist.github.com/thibaultduponchelle/2e30d38f71292581b00cbae76c62a10c

[12:34] *** frost-lab left
[12:42] <MitarashiDango[m> tib: I highly suspect the binding is the culprit `@a := @b`, but I don't know enough about bindings to give you a decent explanation. I suspect using `@a = @b` instead should solve the problem (which should actually copy the array, rather than making @a and @b the same thing), and hopefully someone else can chime in on the why.

[13:03] <tobs> tib: I suspect a bug. On my system I get growing arrays up until around size 400 or so and then both are constant 2.

[13:04] <tobs> running it with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 has both grow up to 1000 elements, as, I think, intended

[13:04] <tobs> tib: I think that's enough evidence for a bug report.

[15:01] <MitarashiDango[m> I don't quite understand the behaviour of a trailing declarator block (#=) on attributes. It gets confusing if you have a conditional default. For example, if you give the attribute a default via a ternary operator, the #= has to come before the semicolon: https://repl.it/@mienaikage/WorthlessBelovedScandisk

[15:02] <MitarashiDango[m> Similar behaviour if you do something like = do if {...}

[19:36] <guifa> Assuming there’s no weird dependencies, is there any advantage or disadvantage to combing classes into a single file or unit’ing them all?

[19:39] *** Sgeo joined
[19:39] <MasterDuke> i believe they'll compile faster as a single file, but that's a compiler implementation thing, not a language thing

[19:41] <guifa> And for a module that’s goign to be precompiled anyways, probably not an issue either

[19:43] <guifa> I have several dozen little subclasses for the different CLDR elements, and now that I’ve started adding serialization code and have to special handle them all, each class is starting to get rather unwieldy

[19:43] <guifa> So I think I’m goign to break them up, which should probably help me in producing cleaner documentation for them anyways

[20:43] <guifa> rir: I don’t think you can tell per se from a script.  Rakudo star is a just a distribution that includes MoarVM, Rakudo, and some key modules.  I guess you could check the version/build numbers of each and reasonably determine it, knowing each star release’s info
