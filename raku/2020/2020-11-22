[13:48] <holyghost> I haven't used it since macos 10.5 and there's no OgreSDK package for mac anymore

[13:48] <holyghost> I hope I can do something on the Intel HD chips for it the nlink it into raku

[14:10] <thundergnat> Hey, has anyone else noticed a ridiculous performance drop with 2020.11? Not with everything, but some of my "benchmark" scripts have literally a 90% decrease.

[14:13] <thundergnat> For instance: https://gist.github.com/thundergnat/1de2636bfad543714e1f94131d275df3 is a variation of a SDL2 demo script included with the SDL2::Raw module. Under 2020.09 I get 223 frames-per-second; under 2020.11 I get 22 (!) 

[14:14] <thundergnat> And I can switch my Raku install files between .09 and .11 and get the same results.

[14:14] <thundergnat> So _something_ has regressed...

[14:26] *** cydf joined
[14:26] <dogbert17> thundergnat: there was some discussion about slowdowns yesterday on #raku-dev

[14:30] <thundergnat> Ah. Perhaps I should go over an browse the logs from there.

[14:30] <thundergnat> If you need a good example script ^^^ that one really shows the slowdown.

[17:27] <ben_> I am trying to avoid matching whitespace at the end of a string while still matching whitespace in the middle of words. Example here: https://gist.github.com/littlebenlittle/92e3fbfaf9cd5b81a3b9fb5af8e9df5f

[17:27] <ben_> Is there a regex pattern for this?

[17:42] *** stoned75 left
[17:43] *** stoned75 joined
[17:44] *** Tirifto left
[17:47] <holyghost> ben_: probably a looping pattern (/g), I don't know for sure

[17:47] <holyghost> else read mastering regular expressions from O'Reilly

[17:49] <ben_> I was able to get something with the same semantic using something like `[<-[\s]>+]+ % \s`

[17:50] <ben_> But I think there is a more canonical way to do it using "right recursive grammars" or something...

[17:51] <ben_> I will look into that book

[17:57] <tbrowder> ben_: have you tried the "$$" anchor or the "\N"?

[17:57] <tellable6> 2020-11-22T09:26:52Z #raku <jmerelo> tbrowder sorry, where's that message? DM?

[17:57] <tbrowder> \N

[17:57] <tbrowder> all but \n

[18:01] <ben_> I guess my question is more along the lines of, "How can I match against an arbitrarily long stream terminted by a known pattern?"

[18:01] <holyghost> I managed to compile 34% of OGRE, OgreMain cpp object files are in, so I should be able to link myself to have a 3D engine for pagan

[18:04] <jmerelo> Hi, tbrowder 

[18:04] <tellable6> 2020-11-22T15:32:40Z #raku <tbrowder> jmerelo msg is DM ref advent

[18:04] <jmerelo> tbrowder: let me see if I can access it

[18:05] <tbrowder> jmerelo: basically i have a wip i could write about if you think its enough

[18:07] <holyghost> I only need to build one OGRE's rendering systems and I can go on to raku

[18:07] <holyghost> *one of

[18:07] <tbrowder> a module that shows a practical use for TWEAK that BUILD can't handle

[18:12] <jmerelo> tbrowder: OK, go ahead :-)

[18:12] <jmerelo> tbrowder: it could complement very well the documentation (or eventually end up there)

[18:13] <tbrowder> ok, i love to scratch itches!
