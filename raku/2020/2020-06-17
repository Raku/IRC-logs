[00:11] <rypervenche> Hmm, that seems to do the same as what I had when I remove the %(). That produces an array of lists. If do: @dir-pairs = @dir-pairs¬ª.Hash; that gets the desired outcome, albeit in an extra line.

[00:56] <rypervenche> Ahh, I'm an idiot. I can just add that to the end of the line: my @dir-pairs = (( "before" X=> @before ) Z ( "after" X=> @after ))¬ª.Hash;

[00:56] <rypervenche> That works. :) Thanks for all the help.

[10:19] <samebchase-> What's the idiom for: "if a key is not found in the map, return this default value instead". I am messing around with the ternary operator, but it seems I am repeating myself

[10:20] <samebchase-> my $val = %m<key>:exists ?? %m<key> !! 'default';

[10:21] <samebchase-> what's an elegant way to type %m<key> only once

[10:22] <lizmat> m: my %h is default(42) = a => 42; dd %h<a b>

[10:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´(42, 42)‚ê§¬ª

[10:22] <lizmat> m: my %h is default(42) = a => 66; dd %h<a b>

[10:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´(66, 42)‚ê§¬ª

[10:24] <lizmat> samebchase ^^

[10:24] <samebchase-> lizmat: nice! I want the behaviour "check if this value is in the map, or return this other value instead". The 'default' value has no connection to the map.

[10:24] <samebchase-> %m<key> or 'value' <-- this behaviour works in some languages

[10:24] <lizmat> you mean only for that particular key?

[10:25] <lizmat> assuming you do not have undefined values in the hash, you could use //

[10:25] <lizmat> m: my %h; dd %h<a> // 42

[10:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[10:25] <samebchase-> lizmat: yes!!! that is what I need

[10:26] <MasterDuke> m: my %h; dd %h<a> // 42; dd %h # just showing it doesn't auto-vivify the given key

[10:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§Hash %h = {}‚ê§¬ª

[10:26] <lizmat> MasterDuke: auto-vivification is much smarter in Raku

[10:27] <lizmat> m: my %h; my $b = %h<a>; dd %h; $b = 42; dd %h

[10:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´Hash %h = {}‚ê§Hash %h = {}‚ê§¬ª

[10:27] <lizmat> m: my %h; my $b := %h<a>; dd %h; $b = 42; dd %h

[10:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar afe851108: OUTPUT: ¬´Hash %h = {}‚ê§Hash %h = {:a(42)}‚ê§¬ª
