[10:53] <ParsonsNose> Hey. I'm trying to use Cro::HTTP::Client, and I'm having some issues - wondered if anyone here could help...

[10:54] <ParsonsNose> so, it's installed (`zef list --installed | grep -i cro::http` shows `Cro::HTTP:ver<0.8.3>`) but `perl6 -e "put Cro::HTTP::Client.get('http://example.com')"` returns `Could not find symbol '&Client' in 'HTTP'` -- any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

[10:54] <El_Che> you need to use it first

[10:54] <El_Che> use Cro...

[10:55] <El_Che> (from tablet typing not easy)

[10:55] <ParsonsNose> `use Cro;` gives the same error, and `use Cro::HTTP::Client` hangs and then dies...

[10:56] <ParsonsNose> `Abort trap: 6`

[11:02] <lizmat> ParsonsNose: could you run your program with "--ll-exception" and put the result in a gist?

[11:09] <ParsonsNose> Doesn't need a gist: ```$ perl6 --ll-exception t.p6Abort trap: 6``` -- is there a higher level of verbosity I could try?

[11:10] <ParsonsNose> .. that pasted badly, it's two lines

[11:11] <lizmat> hmmm... that's not a lot to go on...

[11:11] <lizmat> what OS are you running on ?

[17:01] <japhb> Anyone have any luck with non-trivial asynchrony and GTK::Simple?  I can't seem to do much of anything without invoking various crashes, including "received an X Window System error", whose extended error message led me to GDK_SYNCHRONIZE and thus "[xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing", whose extended error message led me to try using Supply.schedule-on(GTK::Simple::Scheduler) as per 

[17:01] <japhb> http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-nlpw-reactive.pdf and http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-yapceu-async.pdf, which resulted in "MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler". GAAAAAHHHHH ...

[17:22] <moritz> I think somebody else recently had that error, when trying to return from a block that was executed asynchronously, and the outer routine had already returned

[17:57] <oneeggeach> oh interesting: on my machine (Rakudo Star 2019.03.01), the output is '(x => True y => 1 z => 0)(x => True y => True z => False)'

[17:57] <oneeggeach> was hoping someone could explain why I was getting y => 1 and z => 0 instead of True/False

[17:58] <oneeggeach> but perhaps it's been changed in a newer version of Rakudo

[18:00] *** aborazmeh left
[18:16] <japhb> moritz: Well, all of this is happening in the background while the GTK app continues to sit in its main loop; my test code looks like: sub MAIN() { ... create and configure $gtk-app ...; Supply.interval(5).skip(1).schedule-on(GTK::Simple::Scheduler).act: { ... update an interface element ... }; $gtk-app.run }

[18:16] <japhb> So it's not clear what "outer" routine has already returned there.

[18:31] <moritz> japhb: not clear to me either; maybe it's a different bug, or maybe it's in GTK::Simple

[19:53] <jjatria> Hi~ I've been playing around with Raku bindings for Termbox (https://gitlab.com/jjatria/raku-termbox), and I think it's getting close to being releasable. Since this is my very first Raku library, any comments would be more than welcome :D

[20:08] <MasterDuke> oneeggeach: https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/6d76ddfcee2504914f48bc62d318f1ef, looks like it's been fixed since 2019.03

[21:51] <guifa> rypervenche: what are you needing from Lingua::Number ?

[21:52] <guifa> Itâs likely I have or will soon have whatever you need in Intl::Number

[22:10] <rypervenche> guifa: Looking to be able to convert to ordinal number in zh_Hant (zh-TW) locale. It's not a huge deal, I can write something to do it, but I thought it could be useful for other programs.

[22:19] <guifa> Yeah, that will be possible with Intl::Number

[22:20] <guifa> unfortunately due to $day-job Iâve not been able to work on Intl:: stuff in a bit, and I had to drop work amidst a fairly substantial reorganization, but take a look at it.  I donât think I finished up the ordinal stuff, but I know I had most number formatting (and even made a localized number token for use in regexen)

[22:21] <guifa> If youâre needing it spelled out, like in English âfirstâ âsecondâ âthirdâ etc, that will require me doing the RBNF (rule based number formatting)

[22:21] <TreyHarris> I was on the cruise with DrForr -- I never made the connection because of his online handle and he either didn't hear my last name or didn't make the connection either. I wish I'd known

[22:21] <guifa> Which I know I havenât done yet

[22:24] <rypervenche> Hmmm, Intl::CLDR says it *might* work, but has a bug. Let's see if that works. I didn't even think that there might be another module that I could use ><

[22:25] *** chloekek left
[22:25] <synthmeat> (having comprehensive Intl in ecosystem would be amazing)

[22:36] *** squashable6 left
[22:37] <rypervenche> Yeah, doesn't work. I'll write a little something for now since I only need it for 8 numbers.

[22:37] *** aluaces left
[22:40] *** squashable6 joined
[22:45] <guifa> synthmeat: thatâs the goal.  I ended up putting too much in the Intl::CLDR module, and right now Iâve been working to disentangle stuff from it so that Intl::CLDR is nothing more than a repository

[22:46] <guifa> and then Intl::Number or Intl::Date(Time), etc, will be where the functionality resides

[22:49] *** rindolf left
[22:53] <guifa> rypervenche: that note about ordinal taht should be working is for the ::Plural, not ::Number.  In English there are two for cardinal numbers (1 = one, everything else = other), but for cardinal there are more (1 = one, 2 = two, 3 = few, *11, *12, *13 and everything else = other).

[22:54] <guifa> Itâs a module that most people probably wonât ever need to interface with, but if youâre writing a localization framework (I am ha) then itâs necessary because you need to know when to use, e.g., âappleâ (one) or âapplesâ (other), or âstâ (one), ândâ (two) ârdâ (few) or âthâ (other)

[23:23] <rypervenche> guifa: Yeah, the README for Intl::CLDR::Plural says that it's got a but and ordinal numbers don't work.

[23:32] <TreyHarris> "Ordinal should be working but there's a bug somewhere"

[23:38] * guifa knows â¦ he wrote it :-)

[23:38] <guifa> My point is itâs not for generating ordinal numbers, but defining the plural category of the associated ordinal number

[23:43] *** patrickb left
[23:44] <guifa> for Chinese, the result of plural-count($number, :type<ordinal>) should be âotherâ for every single number
