[10:53] <ParsonsNose> Hey. I'm trying to use Cro::HTTP::Client, and I'm having some issues - wondered if anyone here could help...

[10:54] <ParsonsNose> so, it's installed (`zef list --installed | grep -i cro::http` shows `Cro::HTTP:ver<0.8.3>`) but `perl6 -e "put Cro::HTTP::Client.get('http://example.com')"` returns `Could not find symbol '&Client' in 'HTTP'` -- any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

[10:54] <El_Che> you need to use it first

[10:54] <El_Che> use Cro...

[10:55] <El_Che> (from tablet typing not easy)

[10:55] <ParsonsNose> `use Cro;` gives the same error, and `use Cro::HTTP::Client` hangs and then dies...

[11:09] <ParsonsNose> Doesn't need a gist: ```$ perl6 --ll-exception t.p6Abort trap: 6``` -- is there a higher level of verbosity I could try?

[17:01] <japhb> Anyone have any luck with non-trivial asynchrony and GTK::Simple?  I can't seem to do much of anything without invoking various crashes, including "received an X Window System error", whose extended error message led me to GDK_SYNCHRONIZE and thus "[xcb] Unknown request in queue while dequeuing", whose extended error message led me to try using Supply.schedule-on(GTK::Simple::Scheduler) as per 

[17:01] <japhb> http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-nlpw-reactive.pdf and http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-yapceu-async.pdf, which resulted in "MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler". GAAAAAHHHHH ...

[17:22] <moritz> I think somebody else recently had that error, when trying to return from a block that was executed asynchronously, and the outer routine had already returned

[17:57] <oneeggeach> oh interesting: on my machine (Rakudo Star 2019.03.01), the output is '(x => True y => 1 z => 0)(x => True y => True z => False)'

[17:57] <oneeggeach> was hoping someone could explain why I was getting y => 1 and z => 0 instead of True/False

[17:58] <oneeggeach> but perhaps it's been changed in a newer version of Rakudo

[18:00] *** aborazmeh left
[18:16] <japhb> moritz: Well, all of this is happening in the background while the GTK app continues to sit in its main loop; my test code looks like: sub MAIN() { ... create and configure $gtk-app ...; Supply.interval(5).skip(1).schedule-on(GTK::Simple::Scheduler).act: { ... update an interface element ... }; $gtk-app.run }

[18:16] <japhb> So it's not clear what "outer" routine has already returned there.

[18:31] <moritz> japhb: not clear to me either; maybe it's a different bug, or maybe it's in GTK::Simple

[19:53] <jjatria> Hi~ I've been playing around with Raku bindings for Termbox (https://gitlab.com/jjatria/raku-termbox), and I think it's getting close to being releasable. Since this is my very first Raku library, any comments would be more than welcome :D

[21:51] <guifa> rypervenche: what are you needing from Lingua::Number ?

[21:52] <guifa> It’s likely I have or will soon have whatever you need in Intl::Number

[22:10] <rypervenche> guifa: Looking to be able to convert to ordinal number in zh_Hant (zh-TW) locale. It's not a huge deal, I can write something to do it, but I thought it could be useful for other programs.

[22:19] <guifa> Yeah, that will be possible with Intl::Number

[22:20] <guifa> unfortunately due to $day-job I’ve not been able to work on Intl:: stuff in a bit, and I had to drop work amidst a fairly substantial reorganization, but take a look at it.  I don’t think I finished up the ordinal stuff, but I know I had most number formatting (and even made a localized number token for use in regexen)

[22:21] <guifa> If you’re needing it spelled out, like in English “first” “second” “third” etc, that will require me doing the RBNF (rule based number formatting)

[22:21] <TreyHarris> I was on the cruise with DrForr -- I never made the connection because of his online handle and he either didn't hear my last name or didn't make the connection either. I wish I'd known

[22:21] <guifa> Which I know I haven’t done yet

[22:24] <rypervenche> Hmmm, Intl::CLDR says it *might* work, but has a bug. Let's see if that works. I didn't even think that there might be another module that I could use ><

[22:25] *** chloekek left
[22:25] <synthmeat> (having comprehensive Intl in ecosystem would be amazing)

[22:36] *** squashable6 left
[22:37] <rypervenche> Yeah, doesn't work. I'll write a little something for now since I only need it for 8 numbers.

[22:37] *** aluaces left
[22:40] *** squashable6 joined
[22:45] <guifa> synthmeat: that’s the goal.  I ended up putting too much in the Intl::CLDR module, and right now I’ve been working to disentangle stuff from it so that Intl::CLDR is nothing more than a repository

[22:46] <guifa> and then Intl::Number or Intl::Date(Time), etc, will be where the functionality resides

[22:49] *** rindolf left
[22:53] <guifa> rypervenche: that note about ordinal taht should be working is for the ::Plural, not ::Number.  In English there are two for cardinal numbers (1 = one, everything else = other), but for cardinal there are more (1 = one, 2 = two, 3 = few, *11, *12, *13 and everything else = other).

[22:54] <guifa> It’s a module that most people probably won’t ever need to interface with, but if you’re writing a localization framework (I am ha) then it’s necessary because you need to know when to use, e.g., “apple” (one) or “apples” (other), or “st” (one), “nd” (two) “rd” (few) or “th” (other)

[23:23] <rypervenche> guifa: Yeah, the README for Intl::CLDR::Plural says that it's got a but and ordinal numbers don't work.

[23:32] <TreyHarris> "Ordinal should be working but there's a bug somewhere"

[23:38] * guifa knows … he wrote it :-)

[23:38] <guifa> My point is it’s not for generating ordinal numbers, but defining the plural category of the associated ordinal number

[23:43] *** patrickb left
[23:44] <guifa> for Chinese, the result of plural-count($number, :type<ordinal>) should be ‘other’ for every single number
