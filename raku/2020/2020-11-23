[11:57] <tbrowder> hi, folks. if you need some inspiration for an advent article, watch the 1994 movie "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen (English, may have subtitle options).

[12:03] *** BenGoldberg joined
[12:04] *** holyghost joined
[12:05] <holyghost> I've done some more work on racul (http://github.com/theholyghost2/racul), I need to finish the hash code based on a mark and sweep dictionary, then I have the symbol table finished

[12:05] <holyghost> symbol declarations are in though

[12:40] <leont> Is it possible to access the POD of another file?

[12:44] <lizmat> wasn't there a SO question about that recently ?

[12:45] *** moray is now known as morayj

[12:46] <leont> Ah, I guess this one https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53634257/obtaining-the-pod-of-a-module-without-explicitly-exporting-it

[12:46] <lizmat> ah, guess not so recently  :-)

[12:49] * leont has been considering a Pod::Usage, but lacked this piece of logic

[12:49] <lizmat> tbrowder  and jmerelo might have ideas about that

[12:51] <lizmat> afk&

[12:52] <tbrowder> i don't, way beyond my ken, but ugexe might weigh in

[12:54] <leont> Already have some code that processes the POD the way I want (https://modules.raku.org/dist/App::Prove6:cpan:LEONT/lib/App/Prove6.pm6#L70)

[12:55] *** aborazmeh joined
[12:55] *** aborazmeh left
[12:55] *** aborazmeh joined
[12:55] *** abraxxa left
[12:56] <leont> So I think that if I hook that logic up with Module::Pod, or equivalent logic, I will be fine

[13:01] *** abraxxa joined
[13:14] <leont> Hmmmm, is there a way to get to the compilation unit from a CallFrame?

[13:16] *** aborazmeh left
[13:18] <leont> I was hoping my would do the trick, but it doesn't seem so

[13:23] *** sno left
[13:24] *** abraxxa left
[13:24] <jmerelo> leont: Using Pod::Load

[13:25] *** abraxxa joined
[13:27] <leont> That loads a file, in my situation the file is already loaded, and I'd really like to reuse that (e.g. load the pod from precompiled modules)

[13:34] *** Chi1thangoo joined
[13:36] <tbrowder> leont: that looks pretty neat, and handy!

[13:37] <jmerelo> leont: you can use a string with Pod::Load, AFAIR

[13:38] <jmerelo> leont: Also Documentable has a different (and somewhat hacky) way of accesing that, provided by niner

[13:39] *** melezhik left
[13:40] <Xliff> leont: If you can find a way to do this, please let me know.

[13:41] <leont> It seems that calling .perl on a CompUnit dies because Distribution wants a positional argument, and it's called without that by CompUnit!WHICH

[13:42] <Xliff> Yeah, I would like to be able to 'use Compunit::With::Pod' and then grab it's $=pod with introspection.

[13:42] <leont> Probably broken since b4cdccc1c4942f47ee75b6b03e961bd04eed6df7

[13:42] <linkable6> (2020-02-23) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b4cdccc1c4 Improve CompUnit.WHICH

[13:42] <Xliff> Looks like Pod::Load doesn't do that.

[13:43] <Xliff> Although it does provide a suitable alternative. jmerelo++

[13:52] <Xliff> Module::Pod seems to do the same thing without so many calls to CompUnit::*

[22:31] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> thoughts on making a better vscode extension for raku?

[22:32] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> was considering using raku's js backend for extension stuff, but that's probably more trouble than it's worth

[22:33] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> I'll probably end up using typescript or haxe or something for that

[22:34] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> but anyways, I'm not a huge fan of comma (don't really like jetbrains) so it seems like a good idea to me

[22:51] <[Coke]> ISTR VSC had suprisingly good highlighting the last time I looked considering no one had worked on it.

[22:51] *** Kaiepi left
[22:52] <[Coke]> I suppose having a .NET backend would make that easier.

[22:57] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> ISTR VSC?

[22:58] <raku-bridge> <theangryepicbanana> unsure what that is, but I'll look at that I guess

[23:29] <tbrowder> hi, folks.

[23:31] <tbrowder> i'm digging into possibly using a grammar for my Forms module, and may be able to use it successfully but still have some questions.

[23:35] <tbrowder> first question: i would like to use the action methods to build a single class object with multiple child classes kept in the parent class' hashes. where do i locate the parent class during the parsing?

[23:36] *** BenGoldberg joined
[23:37] <tbrowder> second question: if the construction is within the grammar or actions class, how do i return it to the user?

[23:40] *** Kaeipi joined

[23:41] <tbrowder> i know these are basic questions but most examples of grammar use to me are not very practical for my typical use (line oriented records where each line contributes to a class).

[23:41] *** mowcat left
[23:49] <tbrowder> i should have said "contributes to the current class" which allows for new parent/child relationships during parsing.

[23:50] <tbrowder> anyhoo, is a grammar really worth the effort for my simple needs?
