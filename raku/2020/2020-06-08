[13:24] <tbrowder> g'day all

[13:27] <tbrowder> in looping over an array, how can i test for a Nil value? i've tried smart matching a variable i've assigned Nil to but that doesn't work. the docs discuss Nil in great detail i but haven't yet figured out my problem.

[13:28] <tbrowder> i'm seeing this error message in some rakudo core code...back in a moment...

[13:29] <tbrowder> err msg: Use of Nil in string context

[13:32] <tbrowder> i haven't yet pinned down the exact point it happens.

[13:39] <tbrowder> i've been testing in the wrong place i think

[13:44] <patrickb> I'm looking at https://github.com/moritz/perl6-all-modules/blob/08c1a2471fcb8508881862f88cb348c464745f42/cpan/LEONT/TAP/lib/TAP.pm#L531 There is a `has &colored = ...`. That's the first time I see a `has` without a twigil. What's the meaning of that? It seems to be undocumented.

[13:45] *** eery joined
[13:45] <jdv79> lizmat: thanks as usual for the weekly

[13:46] *** vike1 left
[13:48] <leont> It does pretty much the same as a ! twigil, but without the twigil

[13:48] <leont> That said, it's probably clearer to use a twigil

[15:25] <mscha> I reported the (potential) bug: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3748

[15:26] <[Coke]> Is there a user module for locking that works across processes?

[15:28] <[Coke]> mscha: added my note as well

[15:29] <oddp> m: for ^3 { LAST say now - INIT now } 

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«0.002992â¤Â»

[15:29] <oddp> m: for ^3 { LAST say now - FIRST now }

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«Use of Nil in numeric contextâ¤Instant:1591630181.825314â¤  in code  at <tmp> line 1â¤Â»

[15:29] <oddp> Why's FIRST not valid here?

[15:29] <[Coke]> jnthn: should the IO handle .lock work across processes, or only in a single process?

[15:29] <[Coke]> m: for ^3 { say FIRST 3 }

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«Nilâ¤Nilâ¤Nilâ¤Â»

[15:30] <[Coke]> m: for ^3 { my $a = FIRST 3 ; say $3 }

[15:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«Nilâ¤Nilâ¤Nilâ¤Â»

[15:31] <[Coke]> m: for ^3 { FIRST { say 1} }

[15:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«1â¤Â»

[15:31] <[Coke]> I think you'd need to save the result of the FIRST to a state var and use that.

[15:33] <[Coke]> ... Maybe FIRST isn't returning the value ?

[15:34] *** mscha left
[15:34] <[Coke]> m: my $n; for ^3 { FIRST {$n = now}; LAST say now - $n } # this works

[15:39] <oddp> Hm, okay, guess that one goes in my "inconsistencies" markdown file.

[15:39] <oddp> Thanks for taking a look.

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> that `any` behavior is meant to be this way

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> I mean, I don't agree with it, but apparently you can read it two different ways

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> which in my book means it should be outright banned

[15:50] <ShimmerFairy> Is FIRST supposed to be one of those "inlineable" phasers in the first place?

[15:56] <oddp> "Phasers marked with a * have a runtime value, and if evaluated earlier than their surrounding expression, they simply save their result for use in the expression later when the rest of the expression is evaluated"

[15:56] <oddp> Ah, okay. And FIRST is not one of them, it seems.

[16:23] <jnthn> [Coke]: I believe .lock on a file handle boils down to flock or similar, but iirc it's advisory rather than enforced?

[16:25] <[Coke]> ok. So probably want a userspace module for "real" locking?

[16:26] <jnthn> Well, anything that is inter-process is going to depend on what the OS provides

[16:26] <lizmat> "real" locking from Raku's point of view, or from the OS"s point of view?

[16:27] <jnthn> If it's inter-process, has to be the OS

[16:27] <jnthn> https://gavv.github.io/articles/file-locks/#mandatory-locking

[16:28] <jnthn> That...makes it look "interesting"

[16:28] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: i remember having a conversation about it with TimToady a couple years ago. something about how you negate stuff in english compared to de Morgan's

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: yeah, that conversation!

[16:38] <ShimmerFairy> For some reason that's making me think of Lisp's FORMAT

[16:46] <jdv79> is rakoon the best we can do?  do we really want to be the trash panda community?

[16:47] *** abraxxa left
[16:48] <[Coke]> Best I've seen so far.

[16:48] <[Coke]> there's probably some history in chat with other options 

[16:48] <oddp> Non-native speaker here, but isn't "koon" a slur?

[16:50] <ShimmerFairy> only with a 'c', and only on its own. raccoon is a perfectly normal word, after all.

[16:50] *** xinming joined
[16:53] <jdv79> also how does a butterfly and a raccoon mix in terms of logo/mascot - really weird combo.

[17:08] <[Coke]> jdv79: I'd recommend starting a problem solving ticket so we can at least link to an IRC discussion from somewhere.

[18:02] <raku-bridge> <tmtvl> I suggested "rakuneers" and "lizmat and the rakunauts" (the best band this side of OOP), snoofkin likes Rakuneers.

[18:02] <leont> m: class F { method b {}; say &b.signature }

[18:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>â¤Undeclared routine:â¤    b used at line 1â¤â¤Â»

[18:02] <leont> Can anyone tell me what I should be doing instead?

[18:03] <timotimo> does it have to be inside the class body?

[18:03] <timotimo> m: class F { method b {}; say F.^lookup("b").signatureâ¯}

[18:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«(F: *%_)â¤Â»

[18:03] <timotimo> m: class F { method b(int $a, str $b) {}; say F.^lookup("b").signatureâ¯}

[18:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«(F: int $a, str $b, *%_)â¤Â»

[18:04] <timotimo> "&b" is a lexical variable lookup, it'd only find stuff also declared "my", which subs are by default /â¯implicitly, but methods are installed into the class's method table only

[18:04] <timotimo> m: class F { our method b(int $a, str $b) {}; say F.^lookup("b").signature; say F::.keysâ¯}

[18:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«No such method 'signature' for invocant of type 'Mu'â¤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1â¤â¤Â»

[18:04] <timotimo> m: class F { our method b(int $a, str $b) {}; say F::.keysâ¯}

[18:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0a84aa7f6: OUTPUT: Â«(&b)â¤Â»

[18:05] <timotimo> looks like this way you can get a method into the package of the class, but it won't be available as a method any more?

[22:50] <oddp> In crystal I can declare a hash with an additional block that's called whenever keys are missing: 

[22:50] <oddp> `chans = Hash(String, Channel(Int32)).new { |h, k| h[k] = Channel(Int32).new }` 

[22:50] <oddp> The default trait doesn't work like that, it seems. Is there another similar way in raku or do I have to check for key existance at each access location?

[23:37] <raku-bridge> <Snoofkin> I don't know of any super-neat way of doing it, but you could always mix in a role like so:

[23:38] <raku-bridge> <Snoofkin> role Defaultable[$value] { method AT-KEY(\k) { if self.EXISTS-KEY(k) { callsame; } else { return $value } } }

[23:38] <raku-bridge> <Snoofkin> and then you declare a hash like my %hash does Defaultable[42]
