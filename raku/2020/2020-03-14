[14:35] <synthmeat> rypervenche: i'm few chapters from finishing it. pretty good book, tbh.

[14:35] <synthmeat> side-note, due to learning raku during corona, i'll forever associate those two :D

[14:35] <rypervenche> synthmeat: I mostly got it to try to help me with asynchrony, parallelism, and concurrency.

[14:35] <synthmeat> rypervenche: eh, that's just one chapter there.

[14:37] <synthmeat> most valuable chapters (to me, ymmv) seems the one about classes (fair amount of gotchas there, it seems), and 3 chapters about regexp and grammars

[14:37] <rypervenche> Yep. I'm reading as many sources as possible so it will hopefully click at some point. I finally figured out today that with promises, "await" comes first and then the "start" or promises. It seemed as though there were two different syntaxes, but really the first was just putting the promises into variables and then awaiting them at the very end of your code when you finally want to wait for them.

[14:37] <rypervenche> So it helped me better understand/visualize all of that.

[14:38] <rypervenche> I'll read it. I normally don't get much from black and white books, but it can help me better understand the Raku docs, so it's win-win at that point :)

[15:27] <pilne> hey all, I'm having some trouble getting Inline::Perl5 installed on windows10. Using the most recent RakudoStar, and I have strawberry perl 5.30 installed as well. My google-fu is failing me hard on this one.

[15:27] <pilne> my google-fu helped me there rypervenche! and lead me back to vim for the digraphs plugin it offers.

[15:28] <rypervenche> Ah, good good. I use the vim plugin as well.

[15:28] <rypervenche> pilne: What errors are you getting?

[15:28] <pilne> is there a preferred pastebin?

[15:30] <rypervenche> No. I know a lot of people like gists for code, but anything should be fine.

[15:32] <pilne> https://gist.github.com/LamentConfiguration/20ab758f811ffdf467f28fc0adc59de1

[15:35] <rypervenche> I wonder if you're hitting the same problem as this Issue: https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/issues/100

[15:43] <MasterDuke> nine: ^^^ Inline::Perl6 + windows problem

[15:44] <nine> pilne: it's quite possible that Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON doesn't work fully on Windows yet

[15:44] <pilne> so go poke around there

[15:44] <pilne> gotcha!

[15:44] <nine> pilne: you can clone Inline::Perl5's repo and install the dependencies via zef install --deps-only .

[15:44] <nine> pilne: then digging further should be easier

[15:47] <nine> rakudo contains an install-dist.p6 script that you can run from Inline::Perl5's directory. This should mimic the installation part of zef and may give you more useful error messages

[15:48] <pilne> so zef install --deps-only Inline::Perl5 worked fine

[15:48] <pilne> now to clone the repo and run that script

[15:52] <pilne> ... did i install rakudo star wrong? i can't find that script in my rakudo directory

[15:59] <Altai-man_> I think https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/tools/install-dist.p6 is meant

[16:01] <pilne> methinks the problem is no make on this windows box

[16:02] <nine> no nmake either?

[16:03] <nine> We'll expect whatever was used for compiling MoarVM, i.e. whatever used to make rakudo star

[16:05] <pilne> i am installing make for windows now and updating my path, hopefully that works for now!

[16:07] *** sena_kun joined
[16:07] <nine> doesn't strawberry come with a make?

[16:08] <pilne> now it is saying it is unsucessful

[16:08] <nine> Ha! Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON doesn't actually care about what MoarVM says and always expects make to be called 'make'. That clearly needs improvement

[16:09] <nine> any other messages?

[16:13] <pilne> it's not matching the gist

[16:58] <tobs> El_Che: if it's `our sub MAIN` at least, you can look it up through GLOBAL::<&MAIN>.signature. Maybe there are refinements of this that don't require `our`

[16:59] <El_Che> I want the use to use the regular main (without our) and my library hooks into that.

[17:00] <El_Che> so I suspect the regular main should be in GLOBAL?

[17:00] <El_Che> (trying it now)

[17:00] *** markong joined
[17:00] *** markoong left
[17:01] <tobs> I think the fact is that declarations at file scope not in a package go into GLOBAL. But GLOBAL::* lookup only finds `our` symbols.

[17:01] <El_Che> ok, it won't work then

[17:02] <tobs> I'm not sure how the options parsing for MAIN works. Maybe there's a hint in there about how to circumvent the `our` limitation?

[17:04] <rypervenche> Is it possible to have a method name inside a variable and have the call to the method interpolate correctly?

[17:04] <rypervenche> m: my $method = "chr"; say 123.$method;

[17:21] *** oneeggeach left
[17:22] <El_Che> sadly enough, I found it by trial and error, so I need to understand it first before using it:

[17:22] <El_Che> say callframe(2).my<&MAIN>.signature;

[17:22] <El_Che> this is called from the module inspecting MAIN, not the one declaring MAIN

[17:23] <El_Che> so 2 levels up

[17:34] <guifa> El_Che: yes and no.  We‚Äôve cancelled classes and I‚Äôm working on moving coursework online, but anyone who traveled to a level 3 risk country (I transited through) are banned ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù

[17:34] <guifa> vrurg++ did a few fixes for my stuff modules while I was gone though

[17:35] <El_Che> guifa: we also moved to online classes and staff can telework full time (if possible)

[17:36] <tobs> El_Che: heh, clever

[17:39] <guifa> Thankfully I have beer at home ‚Äî¬†can‚Äôt get that delivered

[19:44] <pmurias> MasterDuke: not sure if they have the 20% anymore

[19:44] <El_Che> I just heard on #perl (Magnet) that DrForr perished on a scuba diving accident

[19:44] <El_Che> :(

[19:44] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I think not

[19:45] <lizmat> El_Che: are you serious ???

[19:45] <El_Che> yes

[19:45] <El_Che> sigh

[19:52] <timotimo> that's really sad :(

[19:54] <tadzik> :(

[19:54] <tadzik> rip DrForr 

[19:54] <Doc_Holliwood> Does anybody happen to know his real name?

[19:55] <tadzik> Jeff Goff, like in lizmat's link

[19:55] <Doc_Holliwood> right. silly me. i hardly knew him. only from videos

[19:57] <tadzik> the fb link is unavailable for non-facebook users though

[19:58] <Doc_Holliwood> there is nothing to see there anyhow

[19:58] <Doc_Holliwood> last post is from the 3rd or so

[20:12] <lizmat> .seen DrForr

[20:12] <tellable6> lizmat, I saw DrForr 2020-01-25T20:02:12Z in #raku: <DrForr> And I can talk about blogging and my module conversion strategies, though during a lunch break might be more appropriate for me.

[20:13] <lizmat> still logged in here on #raku as well

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> :(

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> if that is true, there are 7 modules that need to be taken care of

[20:16] <lizmat> it is true, Wendy is chatting with his mother on FB now

[20:16] <lizmat> and some Perl modules as well

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: okay‚Ä¶ well, once things settle maybe we should ask if somebody has access to their github? We can of course fork but transferring is probably preferable?

[20:19] <lizmat> yeah....  in a few weeks,now is not the time to bother the family with this

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> sure

[20:20] <AlexDaniel> very interesting timing‚Ä¶ PS#168

[20:20] <linkable6> PS#168 [open]: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/168 [language] Abandoned modules, deceased authors, etc. (Raku Community Modules)

[20:23] <lizmat> Wendy just posted on FB, this is a markdown gist of that for the non-FB inclined: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/13beb97e0e3a1bb24c893453c9c25d03

[21:37] <lizmat> self."$metho_name"() should ?

[21:37] <lizmat> I guess the parser's not able to handle it
