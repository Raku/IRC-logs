[02:41] <Henri> how do you check for null pointers returned from C native calls?

[02:41] <Henri> I know to pass a null pointer i can use the Pointer type object

[02:41] <Henri> But any value returned will smartmatch against this type object

[02:42] <Henri> But any value returned will smartmatch against this type object

[04:25] <Henri> constant HTSLIB = %?RESOURCES<libhts>;

[04:25] <Henri> I'm trying to use something like this to load shared libraries...

[04:25] <Henri> However, I amg etting use of unitialized value %result{resources/libhts} of type Any in string context

[04:26] <Henri> I thought that constants were evaluated at compile time, so that this should be no issue with the native trait.

[04:26] <Henri> What went wrong?

[04:35] <timotimo> Henri: check for undefinedness with TheType:U for example

[05:05] <Henri> timotimo: thanks for the help.

[05:05] <Henri> the second issue is the one that I'm having more trouble with...

[05:14] <timotimo> that error message looks weird

[05:14] <timotimo> is that really what it looks like?

[05:15] <timotimo> are you pointing your -I at the folder that has the META6.json? that's what makes RESOURCES work

[05:18] <Henri> yeah it's after I use zef install .

[05:18] <Henri> so it should compile my library correctly

[05:26] <timotimo> ah, so it fails during the tests?

[05:26] <timotimo> because when you use zef install you will have to `zef install --force .` after every change

[05:27] <Henri> no yes that is what i am running

[05:27] <Henri> I am just loading the package in a repl

[05:27] <Henri> and testing it

[05:27] <Henri> i do not have tests :(

[05:33] *** evalable6 left
[05:33] *** linkable6 left
[05:34] *** linkable6 joined
[05:35] <timotimo> so where does this %result come from

[05:35] *** evalable6 joined
[05:36] <timotimo> sounds like you're accessing a hash's key that's not in there

[05:38] <Henri> `constant HTSLIB = %?RESOURCES<libhts>;sub hts_open(Str is encoded('utf8'), Str is encoded('utf8'))    is native(HTSLIB) is export returns SamFile { * }`

[05:38] <Henri> ahh, i am having trouble using new lines...

[05:38] <timotimo> IRC doesn't allow newlines in messages

[05:38] <Henri> then a call to `hts_open($bam, 'r')` triggers the error

[05:38] <Henri> well there you go

[05:38] <timotimo> try outputting what HTSLIB is

[05:39] <Henri> I should export it then correcT?

[05:40] <timotimo> nah, just put the output on the next line to see what it is

[05:40] <timotimo> and raku -I . -e 'use MyLibrary;' to cause it to run

[05:41] <Henri> wait I don't have raku... only rakudo

[05:41] <timotimo> no problem

[05:41] <timotimo> but also, how old is your rakudo? :)

[05:42] <Henri> This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11

[05:42] <Henri> implementing perl 6.d.

[05:42] <timotimo> about a whole year, oh well

[05:43] <Henri> Honestly I don't know enough about modules...

[05:43] <Henri> I should really read up on them

[05:44] <Henri> I'm trying to build a little lib for Bio stuff that uses the c library htslib

[05:44] <Henri> It's been more difficult than I imagined, especially considering I just started with Raku

[05:45] <timotimo> native libraries are always extra fun

[05:46] <timotimo> would also be interesting to know what exactly your libhts is, the .so file from the library?

[05:46] <Henri> yeah

[05:47] <Henri> i figured it would be easier to distribute with the compiled shared object files instead of building it from source

[05:47] <Henri> Then I would really have to learn how Raku works...

[05:48] <timotimo> there's a modulethat makes it a little bit easier, but it's still painful

[05:48] <timotimo> is libhts not available in package managers usually?

[05:48] <Henri> No it is.

[05:49] <Henri> But I changed some source files to export a symbol

[05:49] <timotimo> OK

[05:49] <Henri> It was easier than copying the struct's definition exactly

[05:49] <Henri> I wanted to use an opaque pointer type

[05:49] <Henri> And so I needed an extra function

[05:50] <Henri> At least for now, it's not too much of a concern.

[05:50] <Henri> I want this for personal use

[05:51] <Henri> I am getting that %?RESOURCES is nil

[05:52] <timotimo> %?RESOURCES itself or what you get out at the libhts key?

[05:52] <Henri> RESOURCES itself

[05:53] <timotimo> what does the resources section in your meta json file look like?

[05:53] <Henri>   "resources" : [    "libraries/hts"  ],

[05:54] <Henri> I know it correctly detects it by appending lib- and -.so

[05:55] <timotimo> maybe %*RESOURCES is the right one?

[05:55] <timotimo> hm, no

[05:56] <timotimo> but you may very well have to put "libraries/" in front when taking it out of resources

[05:56] <Henri> Still, %?RESOURCES should not be null

[05:56] <timotimo> but if the entire resources thing is missing, you may be loading the module through some way that doesn't have the files associated properly

[05:57] <Henri> Yes that is what I think.

[05:57] <Henri> Surely zef install should do it

[05:58] *** parabolize left
[05:59] <Henri> That worked.

[05:59] <Henri> Thank you 

[06:00] <Henri> Still though, if I run it without zef install --force .

[06:00] <Henri> I can't get META6.json properly associated

[06:00] <Henri> In clojure I could run a repl *with* my library

[06:00] <Henri> Is there anything like that?

[06:01] <timotimo> it should just work if you point -I at the folder with the META6.json in it

[06:01] <Henri> :)

[06:01] <Henri> yay

[06:01] <Henri> now I'm getting somewhere

[06:01] <Henri> thank you for the help

[06:01] <timotimo> cool

[06:01] <timotimo> no prob

[06:02] <Henri> I can now use `rakudo -I . -e "use Bio::IO::Sam"`

[06:02] <timotimo> just in time, too, because i'm leaving :)

[06:02] <Henri> or run it through a repl

[06:02] <Henri> and then install with zef

[06:02] <Henri> thank you

[06:02] <Henri> you've helped me before btw too

[06:02] <timotimo> my pleasure

[12:36] <pmurias> hi

[12:43] <grondilu> pmurias: hi, weren't you the guy working on the js port of rakudo ?

[12:46] <pmurias> yes

[12:47] <pmurias> haven't done anything with it in a few months

[12:49] <pmurias> got a new job at google also we super hard goverment covid paranoia over the summer at got hit hard by the silly restrictions

[12:49] <pmurias> with forests being locked down ;)

[12:50] <grondilu> ok

[12:51] <grondilu> I was wondering if you had any interest in WebAssembly.

[12:51] <grondilu> I asked you about it long time ago but I thought maybe things have changed since then.

[12:52] *** pecastro joined
[12:54] <pmurias> grondilu: I think it's potentially a good way to get rakudo-moar running inside browsers for a try it out repl etc.

[12:55] <timotimo> xinming: you can attach GDB to it, go through all the threads and see which are waiting on a lock, and get the tracebacks with MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)

[12:56] <pmurias> grondilu: I still don't have any interest in working on it myself

[12:57] <grondilu> noted, thanks.

[12:58] <grondilu> hopefully eventually the gnu compiler toolchain will make it possible to target webassembly without any effort on the developper part.

[12:59] <pmurias> it seems like something that will be very doable at some point

[12:59] <pmurias> with this point very likely being now

[12:59] <pmurias> ;)

[12:59] <pmurias> perl5 is already running on webassembly

[13:00] <grondilu> oh is it ?  I didn't know.

[13:01] <timotimo> xinming: the tc object also has the number of locks a given thread is holding

[13:12] <pmurias> hmm what seems to be a good way to work on nqp-truffle from a lockdown work laptop?

[13:13] <pmurias> rent a box and ssh to it? any good suggestions for what to rent?

[13:17] * grondilu has no idea what nqp-truffle is

[13:20] <MasterDuke> pmurias:  does the lockdown extend to not being able to run docker images?

[13:21] <tyil> MasterDuke: I think thats fine, so long as the containers are seperated by 1.5mb of memory

[13:21] <MasterDuke> and excited to see you working on truffle again. i've been distracted by moarvm projects, but truffle is always on the back if my mind

[13:28] <grondilu> pmurias: I'm curious.  Can't you work on that laptop ?  If not don't you have ssh access to an other machine ?

[13:31] <grondilu> I mean if what you need is an access to a linux box I can give you access to mine.  I've always wanted to be sysadmin.
