[03:57] <Poohman> hello all

[03:57] <Poohman> im using perl6 & Comma in windows 7 

[03:58] <Poohman> I have a file with German characters which can be displayed perfectly in Notepad++ in tuf8 encoding

[03:59] <Poohman> If i use the ANSI encoding in Notepad++ I see it change the character

[04:00] <Poohman> but when I read the same file in Perl6 - it dosnt matter what encoding I use to read it I always get the character I see in the ANSI encoding in Notepad++

[04:00] <Poohman> 228	E4	ä	Ã¤

[04:01] <Poohman> in Notepad++ it changes between these 2 characters based on utf8 or ANSI respectively

[04:01] <Poohman> but in Comma/perl6 it is always Ã¤

[04:02] <Poohman> have tried the iso encoding and the all the three windows ones

[04:02] <Poohman> could it be a windows related issue?

[04:04] <Poohman> will be back later - office beckons

[04:23] <[Coke]> elcaro: megaminx is 5 to a side, tera is 7. yup, same basic algorithm, the 5x is much faster to solve.

[05:04] <elcaro> [Coke]: i only know 3x3. i got one xmas '19. i'm consistently sub-30... i think that's about as fast as my old man hands can manage.

[05:27] <[Coke]> the 3x3 I can do in... 15 or so?

[05:27] <[Coke]> the 5x5 takes me about an hour

[05:27] <[Coke]> the 7x7 I just did over the weekend a few 20 minute chunks at at ime

[18:31] <Poohman> anything possible with Win7 in this case?

[18:36] <sjn> Poohman: just checking; are you aware that Win7 is to be end-of-life'ed on January 14th 2020?

[18:36] <sjn> so if you're trying to make this work on win7, it'll basically be a waste of your time...

[18:37] <Poohman> sjn: yes I know that - but I dont have a lot of other options

[18:38] <sjn> yeah, sorry to hear that. is the your own system or one run by your employer or customer?

[18:39] <Poohman> My own is a Linux box, but I dont want to travel with 2 laptops

[18:39] <uzl[m]> IIRC, a subroutine is a kind of routine while a method is another kind of routine. Thus, a subroutine/method is a routine but the other way around isn't necessarily true.

[18:40] <uzl[m]> My question: If something is classified as a method, does it also need to be classified as a routine?

[18:40] <uzl[m]> This question arose while I was looking at this page (https://docs.raku.org/routine.html). In some instances, the type of a name is only a "method". In other, it's a "method, routine".

[18:41] *** wamba left
[18:44] <sjn> Poohman: sorry, I can't help you

[18:47] <sjn> Poohman: you can hang around, maybe someone else knows what to do (I wouldn't keep my hopes up though), or explore some fora or support channels that are more tailored towards windows 7

[18:47] <sjn> Or, just dtrt and upgrade

[18:51] <[Coke]> even if you can't upgrade the win7 laptop itself for work reasons, one can run the win 10 OS in a VM from MS.
