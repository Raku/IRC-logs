[01:47] <tbrowder> have you any perl experience?

[01:47] <tbrowder> have you any raku experience?

[01:49] <Passionate> @tbrowder i would  like to start  contributing on coding.....i do  not have a wide experience on other programming languages like  java,Haskell,Elarng.,Python

[01:49] <Passionate> i mean i do have experience on ther programming languages

[01:50] <tbrowder> you might check the "modules wanted list if you want some ideas for modules. i have to find the link...

[01:50] <Passionate> tbrowder   sure......thanks

[01:50] <tbrowder> back in a moment...

[01:53] <Passionate> tbrowder  sure...take your  time

[01:53] <tbrowder> see https://github.com/Raku/perl6-most-wanted/most-wanted/modules.md

[01:54] <Passionate> The link says  not found

[01:55] <tbrowder> pick something there or pick something not there that you are familiar with in another language

[01:56] <tbrowder> i'll recheck the link

[01:57] <lucs> This appears to work: https://github.com/Raku/perl6-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/modules.md

[01:58] <tbrowder> hm, ok, that's right, but i forget when the blob is required...glad you found it

[01:59] <tbrowder> lucs

[01:59] <tbrowder> anyhoo, maybe something there will interest you

[02:00] <lucs> Yep. I just went up directories in your original link, till it worked, then back down to the .md -- not sure how 'blob' got involved.

[02:00] <Passionate> lucs  yeah it  works thanks

[02:04] <Passionate> tbrowder thanks

[02:06] <tbrowder> Passionate: one more idea for you: check modules.raku.org and look into available modules. speaking for myself, i would love having new features or new tests or new feature requests for my modules.

[02:07] <tbrowder> also, jmerelo usually has a help-wanted list up his sleeve, as does lizmat

[02:08] <tbrowder> time for bed...nite all...

[02:08] <Passionate> tbrowder i think  helping  someone  would be  great  for now.....to familiarize  myself  with the codebase

[02:08] <Passionate> have a good night tbrowder.......

[02:09] <Passionate> How can i  set up my   dev  environment....i dont see that in any of the documents

[02:10] <tbrowder> Passionate, are you fluent in a non-english language?

[02:11] <tbrowder> are you talking about contributing to the core?

[02:12] <tbrowder> if core, go to github.com/rakudo/rakudo and browse there

[02:14] <tbrowder> for other dev env that's more roll-your-own based on an ide or not, etc.

[02:15] <tbrowder> really got to leave, back tomorrow

[12:20] <Zero_Dogg> I've got an array to sort by some value, and if an entry is identical to another, it should sort randomly. In perl I could do "return rand cmp 0.5" from my sort function, when $a and $b were the same  is there any equivalent shortcut in raku?

[12:24] <lizmat> (Less.More).pick

[12:49] <Zero_Dogg> Does raku optimize Array.sort in some way? I tried adding a debug 'say' inside my sort function, and it only prints once for an array o 143 elements

[12:50] *** frost-lab left
[12:51] <lizmat> it will do a Schwartzian transform under the hood when given a comparator that only takes a single parameter 

[12:51] <lizmat> but without seeing the code... can't really tell what's going on  :-)

[12:53] <Zero_Dogg> Here's code: https://paste.centos.org/view/e31939c0

[12:56] <moritz> that looks like a pretty non-sensical sorter :D

[12:58] <Zero_Dogg> well, the array contains a list of articles with a timestamp, I want them to appear in order if one is newer than the other, but many of them have the same timestamp, in which case I want to randomize the order the ones with the same timestamp appear in

[13:00] <timotimo> i think the block is transparent to return

[13:00] <timotimo> so the first time sort calls your sorting function it will return from the function that called sort

[13:01] <moritz> $^b<prism>.<publicationDateInt> <=> $^a<prism>.<publicationDateInt> or (Less, More).pick

[13:01] <moritz> a bit more concise :-)

[13:01] <timotimo> i would recommend just rewriting the block to be like { .<prism>.<publicationDateInt>, rand }

[13:02] <Zero_Dogg> Same is a falsy value?

[13:02] <moritz> but timotimo++ is right about `return`. Removing the returns should fix it

[13:02] <moritz> m: say ?Same

[13:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[13:02] *** aluaces left
[13:02] <moritz> it's a heritage from Perl 5's <=> returning -1, 0, 1

[13:02] <Zero_Dogg> nod

[13:03] <Zero_Dogg> timotimo: I've got to admit, I don't quite understand why that block works, .<prism>.<publicationDateInt> gets expanded to "$^b<prism>.<publicationDateInt> <=> $^a<prism>.<publicationDateInt>" and the comma acts as "or"?

[13:04] <timotimo> no expansion

[13:04] <timotimo> when you give sort a one-argument block, it will map all elements with the block and sort on the results

[13:05] <timotimo> comparing a list like that will first compare the first entries, and if they are the same, compare the next, etc

[13:05] <timotimo> justl ike when comparing stfrings you go letter by lettre

[13:05] <Zero_Dogg> oh, interesting

[13:05] <lizmat> timotimo: I don't think you can get the randomness requested for articles with the same pubDate like that

[13:05] <lizmat> so the comparator *will* have to take 2 args  

[13:06] <timotimo> i disagree :)

[13:07] <moritz> lizmat: I too think this would work

[13:07] <timotimo> m: say <a b c d e f g h>.sort: { 1, rand }

[13:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´(d c f h a b e g)‚ê§¬ª

[13:07] <timotimo> m: say <a b c d e f g h>.sort: { 1, rand }

[13:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85847d2f1: OUTPUT: ¬´(f a h c e b d g)‚ê§¬ª

[13:07] <moritz> you get the randomness for each element, but for those pairs where the first tuple value is different, the comparator never looks at the random value

[13:10] <lizmat> ah, I see what you're doing there... 

[13:11] <lizmat> this works by the side effect of List.Str joining the elements

[13:11] <lizmat> good point!

[13:12] <timotimo> huh?

[13:13] <timotimo> i was convinced sort would work with cmp there

[13:13] <timotimo> and not leg

[13:15] <Zero_Dogg> timotimo, lizmat, moritz: thanks for the help. There are still some times Raku catches my perl-accustomed-brain off guard.

[13:15] <lizmat> Zero_Dogg: please keep asking these questions  :-)

[13:18] <Zero_Dogg> no doubt I will :). I'm quite enjoying writing in raku, so it's slowly replacing perl as my default language to write stuff in.
