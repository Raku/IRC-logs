[12:31] <p6steve> anton: yeah, the raku Jupyter kernel has become a bit flaky - if this happens you just need to click Kernel restart and clear all output in the menu

[12:49] <p6steve> anton: or you can load Jupyter locally (see this Dockefile for the steps https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dan-Jupyter/blob/master/Dockerfile)

[12:50] <p6steve> anton: or you can just ```docker run p6steve/raku-dan:pandas-2022.02-amd64``` (or -arm64) if you want the Inline::Python etc without the Jupyter

[12:53] <p6steve> ```docker run -it p6steve/raku-dan:pandas-2022.02-amd64```

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm pretty sure the code is wrong

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> About the way it is trying to use $dirs

[14:26] <guifa> what would be a good escape string for calling other regex / methods in ECMA syntax (ala <foo> in Raku regex)

[14:26] <guifa> I *think* I can do (?<foo>)

[14:49] <Xliff> Are Raku's macros mature enough to emit a set of need() statements inside of a given scope?

[14:49] <Xliff> I would like to make a set of needs reusable.

[14:49] <Xliff> So I don't have to keep typing them all over and over again. :)

[14:51] <Xliff> Nemokosch: Howso? $dirs should just be a list of '/tmp', '/' and '~/tmp'

[14:51] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[15:07] *** thegargler joined
[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 1. this is a scalar assignment so the last two values are dropped right away

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 2. If this weren't the case, $dirs would still iterate as one element

[15:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4fedb6f05: OUTPUT: «[/tmp / ~/tmp]␤»

[15:56] <Xliff> Scalar assignment should be able to take a List.

[15:57] <Xliff> Huh! You might have a point.

[15:57] <Xliff> So maybe better written as...

[15:58] <Xliff> m: my $dirs = </tmp / ~/tmp>; $dirs.gist.say

[15:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4fedb6f05: OUTPUT: «(/tmp / ~/tmp)␤»

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It can, if you put the parens around. But still, #2 applies: it will iterate as one element that contains the whole list.

[15:58] <Xliff> m: my $dirs = </tmp / ~/tmp>; .say for $dirs;

[15:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4fedb6f05: OUTPUT: «(/tmp / ~/tmp)␤»

[15:58] <Xliff> m: my $dirs = </tmp / ~/tmp>; .say for $dirs[];

[15:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4fedb6f05: OUTPUT: «/tmp␤/␤~/tmp␤»

[15:58] <Xliff> So those 2 changes.

[15:59] <Xliff> Which is the same as...

[15:59] <Xliff> m: my $dirs = </tmp / ~/tmp>; .say for $dirs.List

[15:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4fedb6f05: OUTPUT: «/tmp␤/␤~/tmp␤»

[16:46] <p6steve> anyone know best way to return a CArray via NativeCall? (the docs say a lot about calling with a CArray as param)

[16:47] *** thegargler left
[16:47] <p6steve> right now I am trying via a callback ```sub se_get_data(SeriesC,   &callback (CArray[num64] --> CArray[num64])) is native($n-path) { * }```

[16:48] <p6steve> this gets me this ```NativeCall::Types::CArray[num64].new

[16:48] <p6steve> Array @da = [NativeCall::Types::CArray[num64].new]

[16:48] <p6steve> ```
