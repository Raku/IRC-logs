[11:29] * lizmat wishes the #raku people a enjoyful 2022!
[11:34] <El_Che> I have an half hour, let's have a look at that pesky arm64 :)
[11:35] * El_Che scrolled through the module security discussion and it may be something that could bite us in the ass. Maybe no technical solution is needed, but the documentation should be very explicit about it
[11:36] <El_Che> furthermore a duplication information in a meta6.json and in the source files will result in inconsistencies
[11:59] *** jjido joined
[12:02] <El_Che> ok, a hello world form of success:
[12:02] <El_Che> uname -a
[12:02] <El_Che> Linux cirrus-ci-task-6084719229009920 5.4.129-63.229.amzn2.aarch64 #1 SMP Tue Jul 20 21:22:19 UTC 2021 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
[12:02] <El_Che> :)
[12:03] <El_Che> the trick is to avoid a timeout for 22 consecutive builds (the os+version matrix I build atm)

[19:34] <MasterDuke> looks like camelia is stuck on a commit from nov 19
[19:35] <guifa> I'm not entirely sure though if Nil or 'ok' is the correc tthough.  As I understand it, if A doesn't declare it as multi, then if B does, all of B's candidates will be exhausted before it's dispatched to A
[19:36] <guifa> actually nm on this machine I only have 2021.05, let me check on one with more recent.  Maybe this is just something new-disp fixed

[19:42] <committable6> MasterDuke, ¦2021.12: «ab␤falling back␤(Any)␤»
[19:46] <guifa> I'm guessing the issue is that CALL-ME is a submethod rather than a method
[19:46] *** jjido left
[19:47] <guifa> which normally would be fine:
[19:47] <guifa> m: class A { submethod foo { 'ok' } }; role B { submethod foo { self.A::foo } }; my $a = A.new; $a does B; $a.foo.say;

[19:54] <guifa> okay, so there we go, issue golfed: how to access an A's foo from B ?
[19:55] <MasterDuke> committable6: releases class A { submethod foo { 'ok' } }; role B { submethod foo { self.A::foo } }; my $a = A.new; $a does B; $a.foo.say;

[19:58] <MasterDuke> guifa: looks like it was the new-disp merge. should probably create an issue and/or ping jnthn
[19:59] <guifa> m: class A { submethod foo { 'ok' } }; role B { submethod foo { A.^methods.head.CALL-ME() } }; my $a = A.new; $a does B; $a.foo.say;
