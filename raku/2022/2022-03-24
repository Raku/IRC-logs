[17:51] <Altreus> Is there a whenever equivalent to next? To skip the rest of the block? raku.org seems to be very much down

[17:55] <drakonis> check out raku.guide

[17:55] <ugexe> next

[17:55] <drakonis> by the way, is rakudo's js backend usable for anything yet?

[17:55] <ugexe> m: react { whenever 1 { say 42; next; say 43 }; whenever 2 { say 555 } }

[17:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90d876a3f: OUTPUT: «42␤555␤»

[17:56] <drakonis> and i take there's nothing analogue to clojurescript built with the js backend yet?

[17:59] <ugexe> though you can't use a label ala `FOO: react { whenever 1 { next FOO } }`

[18:00] <drakonis> by the way, is goto ever getting implemented :V?

[18:01] <drakonis> nqp is supposed to already have it but its not available with rakudo?

[18:01] <drakonis> and now for a code question

[18:01] <drakonis> how would i use thunks in raku?

[18:03] <drakonis> i want to delay function evaluation by storing thunks inside a data structure

[18:03] <drakonis> ie: an array of functions that will be called in sequence

[18:03] <drakonis> so i can just push function calls inside the array and then call them

[18:04] *** abraxxa left
[18:10] *** reportable6 left
[18:11] <japhb> drakonis: Code is first class in Raku.  Subs, Blocks, Routines of various sorts can all be treated as function pointers, and behave as closures.  See https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-ANSIParser/blob/main/lib/Terminal/ANSIParser.rakumod for a rather aggressive example of building up function tables to create a state machine.

[18:11] <drakonis> that's fantastic.

[18:12] <drakonis> it solves the extensibility problem i had in mind for the automation framework i'm writing

[18:13] <drakonis> pure raku, as opposed to sparrow's approach

[18:19] <drakonis> which has been to shell out to subprocesses as much as possible

[21:10] <lizmat> raku.org and associated sites should be up again

[21:23] <melezhik> I am contemplating on building ci server for Raku projects, I wonder if people are quite happy now with GH/Ado etc? I think I can build a solution that would be as close to Raku as possible with many features out of the box, but before starting anything ... I'd like if there is a niche for that ...

[21:25] <melezhik> so right now people would write yet another yaml file with devopsih stuff init - like git repo info , zed install and maybe something else ... I am thinking that it's possible to build a solution where people would just point a git repo and that is it, setting all options via web UI

[21:25] <melezhik> no yaml coding required at all

[21:26] <melezhik> so eventually many features could be added without necessity to change anything on users side ...

[21:27] <melezhik> like even now I am thinking about  adding App::RaCoCo test coverage out of the box

[22:13] <guifa_> drakonis: I'm not sure how far the JS will get, but I had it working decently well for a localized exceptions editor

[22:14] <drakonis> i see

[22:15] <guifa_> the problem is (at least doing things in browser) it takes a little bit for Rakudo to compile

[22:15] <guifa_> That might not be a problem on node.js though?  I haven't done anything there though to and dunno if it precompiles its modules

[22:21] *** n1to left
[22:21] <guifa_> I don't imagine it ultimately be used too terribly much on JS or JVM, but it not being pinned to any single VM has been very beneficial for the project in general, I think

[23:40] <melezhik> so ... a very prototype example of such a Raku ci system report could be - https://sparrowhub.io:4000/report/fastspec.notify/440

[23:41] *** Kaipi left
[23:41] <melezhik> this build runs zef tests for Test::Async module checked out from GH repo

[23:41] *** Kaiepi joined
[23:42] <melezhik> also one can test coverage for this module made by App::RaCoCo

[23:43] <melezhik> we can think about all other features included out of the box  by default ( not required any modifications from user side  ) - which are actual for any typical Raku project

[23:44] <melezhik> even now for example it's possible to publish test coverage statistic in html format as App::RaCoCo already does that

[23:45] <melezhik> so modules author would just register in this CI service and point their Github, Gitlab whatever source code urls

[23:45] <melezhik> and that is it
