[09:33] <Altreus> How do I turn a date into localised words? As in, are there/where are the routines to get the local month name, day name, etc, from a DateTime?

[09:34] <Altreus> hmm is Date::Names correct?

[09:36] <Altreus> hmm, zef says no candidates for https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/Date::Names

[09:38] *** Xliff left
[10:04] *** Xliff joined
[10:20] <Voldenet> `zef install Date::Names` works

[10:23] <Altreus> do I need to update something? :x

[10:24] <Altreus> > Thanks again, I will read it atching identity: Date::Names

[10:24] <Altreus> wtf

[10:24] <Altreus> > No candidates found matching identity: Date::Names

[10:25] <Voldenet> weird

[10:31] <dutchie> is there a short way to write `@foo[complicated subscript] = op @foo[same complicated subscript]`? BQN for example has `A F↩` for this

[10:32] <Altreus> you can use "with" to localise complicated subscript

[10:34] <Altreus> @foo[$_] = op @foo[$_] with subscript()

[10:35] *** jaguart joined
[10:35] <Voldenet> Altreus: That package lives only in fez, so make sure your zef uses http://360.zef.pm/ as a mirror (see https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/0e202f2/resources/config.json for current default config)

[10:36] <lizmat> or do "zef install Zef::Configuration" and check/update your config :-)

[10:37] <dutchie> thanks Altreus, that's a little better but still feels a little repetitive

[10:37] <dutchie> maybe unfair to compete against an arraylang though ;)

[10:38] <Altreus> Voldenet: lizmat: ah, thanks :)

[10:38] <Altreus> I'm running a fairly old setup tbh

[10:39] <lizmat> zef upgrade zef

[10:39] <lizmat> should do the trick ?

[10:39] <Voldenet> dutchie: @foo[complicated subscript] .= &op;

[10:42] <dutchie> aha that's what i was looking for

[10:43] <Altreus> zef upgrade zef has at least unblocked Zef::Configuration :D

[10:43] <Altreus> Voldenet: ah, does that work? I was wondering

[10:44] <Altreus> I suppose op(x) is the same as x.&op, right?

[10:44] <Voldenet> subroutine($anything) -> $anything.&subroutine

[10:45] <Altreus> I think I need to upgrade raku cos I can't even install JSON::Fast :(

[10:45] <Altreus> unless that's actually broken :)

[10:48] <grondilu> how can I display a complex structure comprehensively?  On several lines, with sensible indentations?

[10:48] <grondilu> Like with Data::Dumper on p5?

[10:49] * grondilu looked for a module and found https://modules.raku.org/dist/Data::Dump:zef:zef:tony-o

[10:51] <grondilu> I guess I'll use that.  nevermind.

[10:53] <lizmat> there's also Date::Dump::Tree I believe ?

[11:00] <grondilu> indeed, but Data::Dump will do

[11:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> back to yesterday's topic: I think it does send a warning if people repeatedly say that they rather stay away from mutation and specific sigils...

[13:55] <[Coke]> Is JJ the primary/only person on Documentable?

[14:53] *** Sgeo joined
[15:25] <[Coke]> can someone install Documentable (not currently listed in META6.json), clone 'raku/doc' install other deps, and try 'make html'? Trying to see if https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3904 is just me.

[15:27] *** dakkar left
[15:43] <[Coke]> ... nevermind. JJ has mentioned via email that this is the not the way to build the site, waiting for info on the correct way. Hopefully we can close this bug and just update the README.

[16:02] <[Coke]> If anyone is interested in discussing docs related topics, please see #raku-doc

[16:03] <[Coke]> planning, suggestions, issues you've found with the site, whatever. (not everything needs to move there, just trying to give a more focused channel for docs related issues)
