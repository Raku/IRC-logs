[01:53] <ToddAndMargo> native call question:Â  how do I declare a pointer to a pointer (*ppSession)?

[01:53] <ToddAndMargo> my $ppSessionÂ  = NativeCall::Types::Pointer[NativeCall::Types::Pointer].new();

[01:54] <ToddAndMargo> give me a bogus value

[02:37] <ToddAndMargo> Is there a way to do this with NativeCast?

[10:51] <sarna> https://docs.raku.org/routine/spurt says that "spurting a Blob when the handle is NOT in binary mode is undefined" - what if I spurt a Blob to `$*OUT`? as per `IO::Special` docs, its `.mode` will always return Nil

[10:51] <sarna> am I missing something?

[10:51] *** Sgeo left
[10:58] <sarna> it seems to work fine, but in docs there are also examples of subs called on `$*IN` where "Attempting to call this method when the handle is in binary mode will result in X::IO::BinaryMode exception being thrown."

[10:59] <sarna> so I think it can't be in binary mode, right? am I invoking UB?

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that wouldn't make a whole lot of sense, to be honest; because by the same reasoning, spurting textual content to $*OUT would also be UB

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which is nonsense

[11:04] <sarna> why would that be? spurting a Cool is okay iff the handle is not in binary mode (as per docs)

[11:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Å¼ as per IO::Special docs, its .mode will always return Nil

[11:05] <sarna> ah, that. yeah.. I'm confused

[11:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm leaning towards the documentation is wrong. But what is right then, I don't know.

[11:06] <sarna> for now I'll do `temp $*OUT = open '/dev/stdout', :w, :bin`

[11:09] <sarna> ahh, `.mode` refers to the permissions, not binary or not binary. like `0644`. now it makes sense why it's Nil for `$*OUT`

[11:09] <sarna> but now.. if I have a filehandle, can I tell if `:bin` was passed when it was created? there's no `.bin` method

[11:13] *** sena_kun joined
[11:15] <sarna> ahh, it needs to be an `IO::Handle` and not `IO::Path`. `.encoding` needs to return Nil. this is hard >:(

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can't follow you for sure xD

[11:20] <sarna> yea sorry. in short, this works for ensuring the handle you get is in binary mode (so it's safe to spurt a Blob there): `$handle.encoding === Nil`

[11:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's strange that there is no interface for this...

[11:22] <sarna> if you find one, let me know :)

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay ðŸ˜„

[11:25] <Nemokosch> I wouldn't want to open an issue for this because I'm not sure if this is a legit thing to do in the first place...

[11:27] <Nemokosch> .tell japhb in Terminal::LineEditor, if you do something like $*IN.lines, you get a prompt that you can finish with ctrl+d, however, it's not possible to get input for the console anymore afterwards, and it needs to be killed. Is this something intrinsic for how the REPL works or can it be fixed?

[11:27] <tellable6> Nemokosch, I'll pass your message to japhb
