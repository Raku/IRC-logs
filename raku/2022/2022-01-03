[02:43] <unclechu> Hey, when I call `.sink` of a `Proc` (result of calling `run`) does it makes sense to pass `:close` for `.slurp`?

[02:43] <unclechu> I mean in this case: `given run |args, :out { LEAVE { .sink }; .out.slurp(:close).chomp }`

[02:44] <unclechu> Will the .sink ensure everything is closed already?

[11:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the only problem is, there are more questions than people to answer ðŸ˜…

[11:14] <lizmat> re generating a README... I use App::Mi6 that generates the README from the pod in the main source file, or from any other file (settable in the dist.ini file)

[11:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not to underestimate the effort of the "squad"

[11:16] <El_Che> is there a tool to do it in the other direction from md to pod6?

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @El_Che I was just typing the same question! ðŸ™‚

[11:18] <El_Che> While I love Latin, I think that in a lot of settings a English to Latin translater may be more handy :P

[11:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Someone wrote a converter from Mathematica notebooks to Markdown. I can reprogram or extend that converter to generate Pod6. Alternatively, just use a Markdown-to-Pod6 converter.

[11:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @El_Che Usually pandoc can convert a fair amount of document formats. I think it can convert from Markdown to Pod. (Perl5.)

[13:28] <El_Che> I have a terminal always open in my IDE

[13:29] <El_Che> for raku, yes.

[13:30] <holyghost> I use notepad++ for hex editing, also a plugin *blushes*

[13:30] <moon-child> I mean, intellij is kind of notable as being the only ide which has native high-quality support for raku.  If I wrote more raku I would probably be compelled to use it

[13:32] <moon-child> @Anton Antonov I am unconvinced that 'notebooks' are set up well as a _program-writing_ environment

[13:32] <moon-child> (though I do admit they have more inherent structure than text)

[13:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child Yes, I use Comma (IntelliJ). But often enough for quick scripting I use Atom.

[13:35] <holyghost> on macOS 8.2

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child I use notebooks if I have to do repeated experiments and/or documentation, and/or presentations.

[22:50] <[Coke]> 'zef depends Doc::TypeGraph' complains: "Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="dot" to skip)" - but that doesn't seem to be a valid option to pass.

[22:53] <MasterDuke> do you have dot installed?

[22:57] <[Coke]> I'm not trying to install it, I'm just trying to list deps.

[22:58] <[Coke]> (but yes, I do)

[22:59] <MasterDuke> yeah, i just figured if you didn't have it installed a workaround to not being able to exclude it would be installing it, but since you do, that's weird

[23:02] <[Coke]> ah, it's the only thing that module depends on, so that's fine. was trying to solve https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3981

[23:03] <[Coke]> (and I think the fix is: we no longer depend on that module)

[23:06] <japhb> [Coke]: I've had trouble with the excludes in the past, but I've been using them regularly for a while in my rebuild-everything script.  For example:

[23:06] <japhb> App::Mi6         --exclude=curl

[23:06] <japhb> Inline::Perl5    --exclude=perl

[23:06] <japhb> p6doc            --exclude=dot

[23:06] <japhb> DB::Pg           --exclude=pq:ver<5>:from<native>

[23:07] <japhb> (The exclude arg has to go *before* the 'install' command, so `zef --exclude=foo install Bar::Baz`

[23:07] <[Coke]> japhb: sure. doesn't work with 'depends'
