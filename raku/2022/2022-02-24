[05:15] <japhb> Apropos of previous discussion about Data::MessagePack, I've added support for it (and also the MessagePack decode-only module) to serializer-perf (https://raku.land/zef:japhb/App::SerializerPerf).  At the moment its tests can cause Rakudo/MoarVM to throw some very interesting errors, and I can't try on latest Rakudo until File::Directory::Tree is working again.
[05:16] <japhb> Example error fun: "MoarVM panic: Tried to garbage-collect a locked mutex" and "Bytecode validation error at offset 54, instruction 9: register operand index 54 out of range 0..3"

[06:26] <japhb> I'm assuming the .raku produces something with too many params for the EVAL to handle -- but it shouldn't crash like that, and those errors are LTA to say the least.

[12:39] <lizmat> and distinctly remember Russia invading Czechoslovakia in 1968, basically lifting Dubcek from power

[12:40] <El_Che> lizmat: I have seen and studied the same scenario done by the other side of the coin, sadly
[12:40] <El_Che> I hope the fleeing Ucranians will be well received (we've seen the indifference towards the sinking boats the last few years)
[12:41] <lizmat> point taken
[12:43] <El_Che> I saw Putin had unusual support in the NL: FVD and PVV
[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's never those people who suffer the most who caused it
[12:43] <lizmat> I can't help but think that historians hundreds of years from now, will look upon the early 21 century as the time when white male dominance was striking back for the last time
[12:44] <lizmat> yeah, FvD is for sure on Russia's payroll  
[12:44] <El_Che> lizmat: a am feminist enough to think there will be female imperialist leaders in the future :)
[12:44] <lizmat> well, I for one welcome our future female imperialist overlords  :-)
[12:45] <El_Che> Well, Putin's party is according to their manifest Russian conservative and nationalist, so that I can understand
[12:45] <El_Che> where it's get funny is how the far right in Twitter is celebrating Putin's "anti-wokeness"
[12:46] <lizmat> any female imperialist overlord will at least know how it is to give live, rather than take it
[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does that have to do with white male dominance again...
[12:46] <lizmat> that's not funny... that's part of the same mind-set
[12:46] <lizmat> "In Russia they all know how to go to the right bathroom.  And in Russia they only have 2 genders"  Bannon
[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if anything, this narrative caused damage
[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it threw loads of people to populists
[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean yes, don't you ask yourself what the use of this genderistan was
[12:48] <El_Che> What concerns me baby more that there are sign of that crazyness elsewhere. I saw some news about Texas
[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's so overwhelmingly counterfactual to most people that many people will side with those who just oppose it
[12:48] <lizmat> afk for a bit&
[12:48] <El_Che> lizmat: keep sane
[12:48] <El_Che> lizmat: so something to take your mind off the situation for a bit
[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think wokeness is a legitimate ideological problem that is so bizarre to many people (possibly the majority) that you should seriously think whether it's useful to label everyone far-right who doesn't roll with it
[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The thing is more like, we should just stop talking about it for a minute or two, and turn our attention to something... more important
[12:53] <El_Che> Nemokosch#9980: the examples we metion (FVD in NL) and Bannon are not far-right because they fixation on "woke". They present the all enchilada
[12:53] * El_Che programming for a bit; afk
[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know what "all the enchilada" is, I only know that everyone who doesn't welcome mass migration, gay marriage and the likes tend to be automatically called "far right"

[15:36] <nine> Nemokosch#9980: I am married (heterosecually) and both of us are decidedly unreligious and we do not have children. People like us make your argument moot. The debate is strictly about the legal+economical institution. Religions (all several thousands of them) may define their own rituals in their way.
[15:39] <nine> Nemokosch#9980: people who endorse far right positions will have to live with being labled far-right. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions. Getting labled that way may just be a wake up call that someone has lost their way. That's ok. We all make decisions that we'd rather change later.
[15:40] *** squashable6 joined
[15:49] <patrickb[]> I think a big part of the difficulty of the marriage discussion is not being clear about the "strictly about the legal+economical institution" part. The "define marriage" bit is missing I many discussions I have observed. It's made more difficult by there actually being discussions and controvercies of same-sex marriage (the religious sort) in multiple large churches.
[15:50] <lizmat> to me, not allowing two people to get married when they want to be, is a very basic form of discrimination
[15:51] <lizmat> if two people pledge to take care of each other, there should be no legal barrier preventing just that
[15:52] <lizmat> and any other type of legal agreement that doesn't carry the same benefits as a legal marriage, is a stopgap measure at best
[15:52] <[Coke]> If you have a problem with the religious approval of some marriages, take it up with your church. If you have a problem with the civil aspect... tough. Making sure everyone has rights doesn't take away your rights.
[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > People like us make your argument moot. The debate is strictly about the legal+economical institution
[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm not sure if it's required to use the term "marriage" then. I'm not sure if there is much meaning in calling your relation "marriage" either but I don't see how that turns into an argument for "gay marriage", or why it even should
[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> >  people who endorse far right positions will have to live with being labled far-right. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions
[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, I will try to help you understand the problem
[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> take someone from the woke culture and say
[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> "people who endorse marxist positions will have to live with being labelled marxist. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions"
[15:56] * lizmat goes silent again
[15:56] <patrickb[]> [Coke]: I agree.
[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's not really constructive to define people who don't follow _your_ particular value system as the bogeyman of your ideology

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know why remarks of "white male supremacy" are required about the Russian offensive
[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, I pointed out a typo and an abusable part of the code of conduct
[16:03] <[Coke]> what's the typo, sorry?
[16:03] <perryprog> Re CoC: I feel it's pretty blatantly obvious that the idea of same-gender marriage not being okay legally/civilly/whateverly is quite against the CoC, and correctly so, so I'm not sure why we keep coming back to that portion of the conversation.
[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there was an "exiting" instead of an "existing" somewhere
[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Well there should be nothing obvious about it
[16:04] <[Coke]> If you could open a ticket (or submit a PR) or the typo, that'd be great.
[16:04] <perryprog> I got it [Coke] 
[16:05] <[Coke]> perryprog++ # thanks

[16:05] <Geth> ¦ Raku-Steering-Council: review: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/pull/47
[16:06] <perryprog> I mean, it's not really an abusable part of the CoC, in my opinion. It's a guideline, not a DnD ruleset that needs to be followed to the most literal level humanly possible.
[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Where I can find the Raku "community guidelines"? (I made 2 min search with Google without getting anything that explicitly states them ...)
[16:06] <perryprog> it's https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/papers/code_of_conduct.md
[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The problem is that those people who consistently stand up for freedom of speech and opinion eventually end up with the whole skinhead/diehard anti-semitic conspiracist part of the internet
[16:07] <perryprog> I'm not sure I get what point that generalization is trying to make, sorry
[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but in my opinion, that's no reason for legalizing virtual inquisition
[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @perryprog Thanks! (Should have read more carefully the messages above...)
[16:08] <perryprog> np
[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think I quoted that part but I will look it up again
[16:09] <[Coke]> In my experience, people complaining about being lumped in with the nazis should try doing less nazi stuff. It's not that "the woke left" is picking a bad name to call them based on nothing. But this is way off topic. If you have something specific to add about the COC, great.
[16:09] <[Coke]> If you don't want to follow the CoC, that's also fine, but then you can leave.
[16:10] <[Coke]> And having dropped that... back to $dayjob here for a while. Good luck, woke leftie marxists, keep fighting the good fight.

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I get that this sounds like rightful elimination of all evil to those who are living with this mindset
[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But this seems quite creepy a couple of lines under talking about "stalking"
[16:11] <perryprog> I don't follow. What's your issue with that statement?
[16:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Mainly that it's noone's business what someone holds "separate"
[16:13] <perryprog> That's not true, and the justification is right there. If I started hosting a Neo-nazi white supremacy blog then it doesn't matter what I'm doing here
[16:13] <guifa> The idea is quite simple (and I guess we've already been Godwin'd): it doesn't matter how technically amazing at Raku that Hitler was, he wouldn't be welcome.  No Jew, Roma, or LGBT member would feel remotely safe in Raku spaces.
[16:14] <perryprog> ^^
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Do you pose this as an axiom or do you have something for it?
[16:14] * perryprog is done with this convo
[16:15] <perryprog> Just have to step out, sorry
[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But as we all know, it's not really realistic having to deal with a stereotypical Hitler image in the Raku community
[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @guifa This is sort of a related discussion: https://linux.slashdot.org/story/22/02/23/0537213/reiserfs-proposed-to-be-removed-from-linux-in-2022
[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Therefore I don't think this analogy can be applied to the real-life scenario

[16:17] <[Coke]> one of the unacceptable behaviors, btw, is "Continuing or repeatedly starting a conversation in an inappropriate venue (for example, debating the merits of a Code of Conduct violation in the general #raku IRC channel rather than in the appropriate GitHub issue or repeated off-topic conversations in #raku-dev)."
[16:18] <[Coke]> So please, if you have an issue with the substance of the COC - please free free to open a ticket.
[16:19] <lizmat> discord-raku-bot: help
[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's more than ironic to add something like this to the Code of Conduct
[16:25] <[Coke]> Again, please open a ticket.
[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think we are having an appropriate conversation but okay, will do that
[16:26] <[Coke]> I do not.
[16:26] <[Coke]> Thanks for wrapping it up.
[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyways, COC aside, it's important that people are sometimes confronted with their beliefs so that they don't start forming bubbles
[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I hope we can agree on that at least
[16:30] <japhb> Nemokosch, it's not your job to confront people, and especially not on this channel.  STOP.
[16:31] <[Coke]> I suggest searching for the paradox of tolerance.
[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I know that and it's often deliberately misunderstood
[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> japhb, this message was kind of aggressive, please hold your horses if I do the same.

[16:34] <[Coke]> nemo, please stop. Open a ticket and drop it. if that's too much to ask, then perhaps this community isn't a good fit for you.
[16:34] <japhb> Nemokosch: I'm trying to be clear.  This whole discussion is unwelcome.  Stop.
[16:34] <[Coke]> japhb++
[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> No need to look for bad faith in everything
[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I find the discussion informative... but I joined 10 min ago.
[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I would be more than happy if you just stopped if you cannot make non-aggressive remarks; no need to silence me any further.
[16:37] <japhb> Nemokosch: You do not need to get the last word in.  You do not win an argument by continuing to talk.  Leaders of the community have asked you to stop.  Just.  Stop.  Talking.  (DON NOT REPLY.)
[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But you surely do win it by keeping this aggressive tone...
[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> This is childish. Just let me file the issue without having to come back to further and further banters.

[16:58] <m_athias> Are there, apart from the CoC, any guidelines on offtopic discussions? If #raku keeps on growing maybe a #raku-casual channel might be appropriate. Various communities established -casual channels/subreddits/etc where discussion that fits the environment but is considered offtopic can take place.
[17:00] <japhb> m_athias: We have spawned a few channels over the years for things that only some of the audience was interested in, such as particular frameworks, or Raku folk interested in talking about gaming, or what have you.
[17:01] *** jjido left
[17:02] <japhb> But: the way that Libera.chat works, the raku org owns any channel that begins with #raku-, so we can't make a channel named #raku-<something> that is counter to the CoC.
[17:04] <m_athias> Just in case: I was not trying to start a channel that is counter to the CoC. While I have strong opinions on some of the issues raised above I, try to, keep politics/religion/etc "at the door". 
[17:06] <japhb> m_athias: Oh, wasn't assuming you were wanting to do that.  I was just explaining why there's no channel for Raku folk who want to focus on politics and religion.  :-)
[17:08] *** notna joined
[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @japhb So, we can have channels like `#radical-raku`, `#truth-social-raku` , or `#marxist-racoons` ?
[17:14] <m_athias> I was involved in moderating various online communities and, once they reached a certain size, all of them required some "offtopic" outlet. 
[17:14] * guifa signs up for #amazeball-professorial-rakoons and invites… jmerelo.  anyone else? ha

[17:15] <guifa> jeez, that's been a while

[17:15] <lizmat> @jjmerelo
[17:15] <MasterDuke> japhb: i also get an abort in mutex cleanup code when i run the example in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4236 with `--full-cleanup`
[17:16] <guifa> I actually need to e-mail him (re same thing I /msg'ed you the other day).  I've got his $day-job one and he's crazy responsive there
[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> More importantly, is my posted message above adhering to Raku community’s CoC or not? (I kind of know one possible answer — I should file ticket…)
[17:17] <MasterDuke> i tried to fix it, but never got a working patch
[17:21] <japhb> Anton Antanov: There's the namespacing issue (which I know of because I ran across it before), but there's also the CoC/guidelines for the entirety of Libera.chat.  I don't speak for them, but I suspect intentionally trying to work around namespaces be reversing them would be frowned upon.
[17:21] <japhb> *by
[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @japhb You are helpful.
[17:23] <japhb> MasterDuke: Hmmm.  OK, more evidence for the pile I suppose.

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> All this CoC adherence discussions make me consider making a Machine Learning (ML) classifier -- in Raku -- that classifies text messages into the labels "adhere" , "does no adhere", and "mu". And endow that ML classifier with a Cro web service, so people can use it from any location to verify, check, and self-censor their potential posts in Raku channels or personal blogs.
[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 😂
[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, there is <#538435064116281365> on discord but most people don't seem to be using discord in this community
[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so it cannot really fulfill a purpose
[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Sent the issue to RSC

[19:41] <[Coke]> if I install "File::Directory::Tree", and then use zef list --installed, I get File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>
[19:41] <[Coke]> but if I uninstall it, and then try 'zef install "File::Directory::Tree"', I get "no candidates found matching..."
[19:42] <[Coke]> seems to work with File::Temp:ver<0.0.10>:auth<zef:rbt> though
[19:42] <[Coke]> er, "and then try" was with File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>
[19:52] <[Coke]> (trying to pass the working one through a powershell invocation of zef then also results in 'no candidates found', crud.
[19:55] <ugexe> what if you use single quotes instead
[19:57] <[Coke]> fixed powershell issue, but the failure to find the :auth<labster> one seems problematic.
[19:57] <ugexe> ah File::Directory::Tree doesn't have an explicit auth set
[19:57] <ugexe> it has 'author'
[19:57] <ugexe> which does get treated as 'auth' in some cases, but thats an old -ism from before 6c
[19:58] <[Coke]> ok. so, not worth fixing in zef, open a ticket with the module?
[19:58] <ugexe> yeah
[19:59] *** ismustac1 joined
[19:59] <ugexe> i should probably remove those remaining author/authority as auth remnants in zef one of these days tho
[20:00] <ugexe> so `zef list --installed` doesn't show you File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>

[20:15] <[Coke]> and that was 5 years ago!
[20:15] <japhb> I was about to say, "Meanwhile, 3.5 years later ..."
[20:15] <nine> That....makes me think I'm doing something wrong :D
[20:21] *** lichtkind left
[20:27] <[Coke]> sweet. Have a powershell script that does a hard reinstall on windows (assumes a LOT) but takes the x-step process and reduces it to a single command. (including re-installing the modules with zef)
[20:28] <[Coke]> only useful for people who are maybe, say, doing a git bisect on windows.
[20:30] <MasterDuke> why do you need to reinstall everything?
[20:32] <[Coke]> because going between versions, I've had the install dir get screwed up, since there is no uninstall, only "install on top"
[20:33] <[Coke]> so having dealt with that once... never again. it's probably ignorable if you're just installing a release every few months.
[20:33] <[Coke]> (and would never happen with rakubrew)
[20:33] *** lichtkind joined
[20:33] <MasterDuke> i can see that for rakudu, but i thought modules haven't needed to be reinstalled for a long time
[20:34] <[Coke]> ... to be fair, I have been around for a bit.
[20:34] <MasterDuke> but i know windows support in general isn't quite as good. might be nice to file an issue if you can repro something not behaving correctly
[20:35] <[Coke]> ... I'm usually trying to fix *other* things, so don't want to accidentally shave a yak while doing so, that's all

[20:41] <MasterDuke> speaking of windows, is anyone here familiar with jom? i was trying to use it instead of nmake on windows, but it won't build a clean checkout of moarvm, complaining about not being able to find one of the 3rdparty dependency .objs
