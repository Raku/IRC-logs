[07:10] <nine> drakonis: RakuAST is still missing support for a lot of features. Some of them rather difficult (like support for parametric roles and BEGIN time execution that I'm currently working on) but many of them are just adding missing parts to the grammar (with the old grammar as template) and implementing new RakuAST classes to represent them (again with templates available).

[07:13] <nine> I got into RakuAST by simply building rakudo and running RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ./rakudo-m -Ilib t/12-rakuast/literals.t (because I guessed it might be one of the easier ones) and following up on any error message that would come up. A few weeks later, RakuAST could compile Test.rakumod.

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how can I manipulate bytes? I need to convert endianity of integers

[13:11] <leont> My beard was so long back then ðŸ™ˆ

[13:11] <moritz> see the Blob/Buf types

[13:12] <leont> Yeah, write-uint-64 and friends are useful for that

[13:13] <perryprog> You can do any($a, $b) > 2?!?!?

[13:14] <perryprog> I can't believe I didn't know that. That's something I've always wanted in other languages when writing long conditionals.

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> pretty handy isn't it

[13:18] <leont> You can even do things like %hash{any($a, $b)} > 2

[13:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Buf does the trick, thank you

[13:29] <perryprog> Reinstalling raku... is there any advantage over using Linenoise versus Terminal::LineEditor for the repl?

[13:29] <perryprog> Or just readline

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> autocomplete abilities surely differ

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I don't know how they compare exactly

[13:49] * leont would really like an asynchronous readline implementation

[13:58] *** ocomporto left
[14:07] <japhb> Terminal::LineEditor should I believe be a superset of Linenoise in current capability

[14:08] <japhb> (If there's something that Linenoise's Rakudo integration does that Terminal::LineEditor does *not*, I'd like to know.)

[20:07] <melezhik> hi community! what's up?

[20:11] <perryprog> o/

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@779471841270038528> Maybe I fixed the bug you reported to one of my packages a month ago...

[20:38] <melezhik> Anton - should you bump a version of Pretty::Table as well? - it still fails - http://sparrowhub.io:2222/report/531

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> There is a new version -- 0.0.3 -- of the package "Text::Wrap", but an old one is picked with zef install (0.0.1). Please see my comments at GitHub: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Data-Reshapers/issues/1

[21:03] <ugexe> if your distribution requires a specific or minimum version of a dependency you should declare that

[21:05] <ugexe> "depends" : [ "Text::Wrap:ver<0.0.3+>" ]

[21:06] <ugexe> if you have `"depends" : [ "Text::Wrap" ]` that is the same as `"depends" : [ "Text::Wrap:ver<*>" ]`, and if someone already has Text::Wrap:ver<0.0.1> installed that would fulfill that requirement based on that META6.json

[21:07] *** linkable6 left
[21:07] *** evalable6 left
[21:07] <ugexe> as for why its choosing 0.0.1 automatically its because the fez ecosystem is preferred over the other ecosystems

[21:08] <ugexe> your 0.0.3 is not available through the fez ecosystem

[21:08] *** lichtkind left
[21:08] *** evalable6 joined
[21:08] *** linkable6 joined
[21:09] <ugexe> declaring your dependency like i mentioned before would force it to not select the 0.0.1 found in the fez ecosystem

[21:10] <ugexe> also note that when you do `zef install Foo::Bar` is looks at modules within a distribution. the _ distribution apparently provides a Text::Wrap

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @ugexe Thanks! I hope that will fix the issue. Just to be clear, my package "Data::Reshapers" depends on "Pretty::Table", which depends "Text::Wrap". I was not that aware of "Text::Wrap" before starting to look into this issue...

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Ah, good to know.

[21:11] <ugexe> you could still declare the transitive dependency in your top level module to pin it, although yeah its a little less than ideal

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @ugexe Thanks! I hope that will fix the issue. Just to be clear, my package "Data::Reshapers" depends on "Pretty::Table", which depends on "Text::Wrap". I was not that aware of "Text::Wrap" before starting to look into this issue...

[21:13] <ugexe> https://github.com/codesections/_/blob/main/META6.json is the other distribution with a Text::Wrap fwiw

[21:14] *** n1to left
[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @ugexe I just put in dependency in the form you suggested and uploaded the new version of "Pretty::Table" to PAUSE. (The installation worked without on my laptop.)
