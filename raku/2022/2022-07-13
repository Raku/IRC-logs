[12:31] <guifa> interesting

[12:32] <guifa> it seems that $0, $1, etc are bound rather than calling $/.list.AT-KEY

[12:32] <guifa> so if you muck with the results of AT-KEY, $/.[2] might not be equivalent to $2

[14:15] <[Coke]> instead of EVAL "/$s/", can you use / $s / ?

[14:15] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Regex_interpolation

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> $s does turn into its content, that's for sure

[14:19] <[Coke]> m: my $a = "what"; my $b = '<[aeiou]>'; dd $a ~~ / <$b> /;

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e300e615: OUTPUT: «Match.new(:orig("what"), :from(2), :pos(3))␤»

[14:19] <[Coke]> m: my $a = "what"; my $b = '<[aeiou]>'; dd ($a ~~ / <$b> /).Str;

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e300e615: OUTPUT: «"a"␤»

[14:20] <[Coke]> m: my $a = "what"; my $b = '<[aeiou]>'; my $c = / <$b> /; dd $c; #if you need it as a separate object.

[14:34] <guifa> [Coke] I'll try.  Not sure how the interpolation will handle the role being applied

[14:34] <guifa> I'm fairly certain there's some weird scoping issue going on with $/

[14:38] <[Coke]> (not working on your system) - what version of raku/OS?

[14:43] <guifa> lol

[14:43] <guifa> I'm a massive idiot

[14:43] <guifa> bad use of state 

[14:43] <[Coke]> glad you found it!

[14:44] <guifa> still have to figure out how I'm going to handle ECMA's weird quantified captures

[14:44] <guifa> but once that's done this module should be basically ready to release

[14:49] <tinita> currently on openSUSE it doesn't build anymore: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE:Factory/perl-Inline-Python/standard/x86_64
