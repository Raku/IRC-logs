[02:56] <guifa_> In general, you should only worry about underlying structures unless you have a reason to (so a b-tree might be useful for some problems when you'd be interacting directly with it, but with a hash or array, how it works under the hood may actually even vary by implementation)

[19:28] <Voldenet> I've created accounts on twitter/mastodon and never used those. It feels easier to follow discussions on chats (irc/discord/slack) or issue trackers
[19:28] <Voldenet> or SO
[19:37] <avuserow> `with` and MAIN with Bool parameters are very nice pattern. I'm writing a small CLI to update a config file. This lets me write `MAIN(Bool $cli-flag)` and later `$conf<foo> = $_ with $cli-flag`. This leaves the current value intact if the flag is not provided. Very happy with this.
[19:37] <El_Che> micro blogging is great for announcements and brainfarts
[19:37] <El_Che> both can be fun
[19:39] <Voldenet> brainfarts are better on irc, because irc is temporary, it's literally gone once it's transmitted… ;)

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the irony of "toxic people will destroy the community" is that you only need to go back a couple of years to see that almost anyone could be "proven" to be a toxic person. One could even say that "toxic people" have already destroyed the community, and not once. But honestly, from what I see, those "toxic people" weren't some ill-willed manipulators, just members of the community who happened to end up at a dead 
[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> having said that, my complaint is actually less directed against the CAT itself, more about setting the priorities. "community affairs" have a lot of bikeshedding potential and currently the main worry is the lack of activity, not the abundance of destructive forces
[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if the CAT can actually help people be comfortable with doing marketing & management kind of stuff, I very much welcome it
[21:55] *** bigfondue left
[21:56] *** sena_kun left
[21:59] <[Coke]> Having had to deal with cat-level situations in multiple communities before, having clear guidelines about acceptable behavior is absolutely welcome.
[22:00] <[Coke]> Having seen people in those communities who were either deliberately hurtful OR obvlivious that their behavior was not acceptable to others in the community, having the cat makes it clear.
[22:02] <[Coke]> regarding priorities - You are welcome to your opinion about what should be prioritized; we've discussed elsewhere that in general, our community's volunteer time is not fungible at best.

[22:27] *** bigfondue joined
[22:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know. I find it somewhat cynical to apply the "non-fungible volunteer time" in the context of representatives of the community.
[22:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's not quite the same as somebody picking Raku for whatever reason and making a tamagochi module and then leaving or sth
[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Mind you, it's perfectly alright if *my* priorities are argued and decided against - but to say that the so-called "steering council" is not responsible whatsoever for carefully setting the priorities regarding the, well, "steering" of the community, that sounds like taking away the purpose of such a governing body at the first place.

[23:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> again, there are multiple resolutions. For example, I definitely wouldn't be badgering if I could update that site myself in the nature of forgiveness > permission or something. Another option could be that you decide to spend time more frequently on raku.org - doesn't even have to be significantly more time, just more regularly.
[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my goal (and perhaps I could say *our* goal) isn't to point fingers at people but to get things done
