[14:47] <lucs_> I have this, to convert inches to cm:
[14:47] *** lucs_ is now known as lucs
[14:47] <lucs> ｢sub prefix:<θ>($n) { return $n * 2.54 }｣
[14:48] <lucs> But I get this error when $n is for example not an integer:
[14:48] <lucs> ｢Malformed postfix call at ⋯ ------>  ⋯ θ1.⏏5｣
[14:48] <lucs>                                                                      
[14:48] <lucs> Fixable by using ｢θ(1.5)｣ or by making it a postfix operator instead.
[14:48] <lucs> Any way to fix it so it will work with simply ｢θ1.5｣?
[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Does anyone know how to disable the "Live Preview" in Comma? (For example, in the last Comma version I consistently get some additional white pane opening when I open a file, and it seems that crashes Comma 5-10% of the time.)
[15:01] <vrurg> lucs: I'm afraid, you'd need a space after the symbol. Because it's an alpha, θ1 considered an identifier.
[15:02] <lucs> Ah, interesting. So if I use a non-alpha operator, it should work, eh. Will try that.
[15:02] <lucs> Thanks.
[15:02] <vrurg> lucs: It should.
[15:03] <vrurg> Anton Antonov: I found no permanent way. Only by clicking the 'Code' button at the top.
[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see -- thanks!
[15:05] <vrurg> Sometimes live preview gets stuck after clocking, in which case I have to close the tab and re-open. Normally the file would open without it then. But it only relates to the current pane if split view. For other panes I have to repeat the sequence.
[15:05] <lucs> vrurg: Yep, it does. Thanks again.
[15:05] <vrurg> *after clicking
[15:05] <vrurg> lucs: welcome! :)
[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @vurg Ok, I will try all these steps / observations.
[15:08] *** swaggboi joined
[15:08] <vrurg> Anton Antonov: BTW, one more note. I stucks less often if you let it index the file first. Sometimes there is progress bar in a popup opening when hover over the Code button
[15:08] <vrurg> *It stucks
