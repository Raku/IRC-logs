[11:42] <equinox> hello

[11:42] <equinox> m: multi si(Str $s, Int $i) | (Int $i, Str $s) { die "dispatch went wrong" unless $s ~~ Str && $i ~~ Int; "s:$s i:$i"; }; si "", 2

[11:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> multi si(Str $s, Int $i)⏏ | (Int $i, Str $s) { die "dispatch went␤    expecting any of:␤        new name to be defined␤»

[11:43] <equinox> so this doesn't work, doesn't compile but is there something i miss or it is not implemented yet?

[11:44] <equinox> i take the code from roast

[12:08] *** reportable6 left
[12:09] *** reportable6 joined
[12:10] <lizmat> equinox: from where in roast ?

[12:11] *** equinox36 joined
[12:11] <lizmat> equinox: also, what do you need inside the "si" multi?  strings or integers?

[12:12] <equinox36> $s as a String, $i as an Integer

[12:12] <lizmat> m: multi si(Str $s, Int $i) { dd }; multi si(Int $i, Str $s) { dd }; si 42, "foo";   si "foo", 42

[12:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: «sub si(Int $i, Str $s)␤sub si(Str $s, Int $i)␤»

[12:13] <lizmat> ^^

[12:13] <equinox36> yes but

[12:13] <equinox36> trying to write 1 multi only

[12:13] <equinox36> https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S06-signature/multiple-signatures.t

[12:14] <lizmat> interesting

[12:14] *** equinox left
[12:14] <lizmat> even though that file is in roast, is is *not* part of the spectest, and it also doesn't compile, as you already saw

[12:15] <equinox36> oh

[12:15] <lizmat> so I'd say it's a definite case of NYI

[12:15] <equinox36> didn't know spectest is something different than the entire repository

[12:15] <equinox36> where do you check the spectest?

[12:16] <lizmat> in my rakudo source dir, I did: raku t/spec/S06-signature/multiple-signatures.t 

[12:16] <lizmat> to do the whole spectest, I do: make spectest

[12:17] <lizmat> fwiw, I think it could be relatively implemented, by creating multiple candidates under the hood for you

[12:17] <lizmat> for *your* case

[12:18] <lizmat> but suppose the different signatures refer to differently named parameters

[12:18] <lizmat> then the body of the sub wouldn't know what to do?

[12:19] <lizmat> ah, looking at the tests, apparently it *is* forcing the same set of parameter names

[12:19] <lizmat> "multis with multiple sigs must have the same set of formal variables"

[12:23] <equinox36> so as long as the variable name and the sigil is the same (and exactly the same) among different signatures, order, types, named-ness can differ, right?

[12:24] <equinox36> i think this is very cool, for example the `three` sub there in the test

[12:24] <equinox36> what would be the sketch path for this to be implemented would you say?

[12:24] <lizmat> the way I read the tests, indeed...

[12:24] <lizmat> it's about what the names/sigils are inside the body, that matters, not how they appear in the signatures

[12:24] <lizmat> which makes sense

[12:25] <lizmat> but alas, NYI...  PR's welcome!  :-)

[12:26] <equinox36> i can try! (and fail probably)

[12:27] <equinox36> what would be the sketch path for this to be implemented would you say?

[12:27] <lizmat> 1. look in src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp where the boundary between end-of-sig and the body is being handled

[12:28] <lizmat> (this is also handling traits btw, which could be an interesting and possibly complicating factor

[12:29] <lizmat> 2. introduce | as a way to specify another signature and keep track of the signatures, checking that all signatures have the same formal parameters

[12:30] <lizmat> 3. look where a completed body in the src/Perl6/Actions.nqp is being hooked up with the signature, and hook up all of the signatures with the same body

[12:30] <lizmat> I'm probably forgetting things here  :-)

[12:34] <equinox36> thank you

[19:02] <tonyo> new version of fez is about to land where it should get rid of the bundling problems people are seeing with the weirdness in git's bundler and some tar commands not being available in certain OSes

[19:17] <xinming> SmokeMachine: ping

[19:18] <xinming> SmokeMachine: do we have correct way to programatically to add columns to existing model?

[19:23] <xinming> SmokeMachine: What I'm trying to do is something like role for model, for example, article role will have many "required" columns, which can be a role, and exact model can add extra columns when needed.

[19:33] *** jgaz left
[19:33] <xinming> Or, is it possible to have something like, model_role  keywords to generate roles for model.

[19:59] <xinming> I just think, probably, this is where macro can be useful in this case.

[21:20] * guifa knows that with RakuAST he could make `multi sub foo (Str, Int) | (Int, Str) { ... }` work

[21:22] <equinox> cool

[21:22] <equinox> i found  `token multisig` in Grammar.nqp after lizmat's directions

[21:23] <equinox> and it does say "Not really implemented yet."

[21:25] <guifa> (the problem is that RakuAST isn't around.  Unfortunately, certian parts of compiling with QAST and $*W is a bit opaque to me still)

[21:26] <guifa> if you don't mind a very small restriction, I could make it for you in a trait

[21:27] <equinox> oh my

[21:28] <equinox> i don't mind, what's the restriction

[21:31] <guifa> wouldn't have control over two the order of two same types

[21:31] <equinox> my main excitement was about it allowing a parameter to be passable as named as well as positional

[21:31] <guifa> ah

[21:31] <guifa> I could do that one too, I was thinking mainly on the unordered bit

[21:31] <guifa> lemme see what I can come up with 

[21:32] <equinox> ty
