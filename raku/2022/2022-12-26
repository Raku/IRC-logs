[01:18] <ugexe> i've had random zef tests fail 6 times in a row now

[01:18] <ugexe> only on windows

[01:19] <ugexe> appveyor might have a similiar issue for me once every ~10 runs

[03:32] <Homer_Simpson> is there a way to do raku.exe mysourcefile.raku myprogram.exe from within a notepad++ plugin

[03:33] <Homer_Simpson> I used to be able to run GCC from a notepad++ plugin that was configured to run uf I hit f6

[03:34] <Homer_Simpson> I don't really want to use cmd as the ide using raku.exe

[03:34] <Homer_Simpson> it has no syntax highlighting and its  more of a REPL than an IDE

[03:35] <Homer_Simpson> notepad++ lets me make my own syntax highlighting

[14:45] <Xliff> guifa: Heya. Are you using RakuAST, yet?

[14:45] <guifa_> Xliff: I am

[14:46] <guifa_> Actually doing a total rewrite of Intl::Format::Number with it right now

[14:46] <Xliff> How is that going?

[14:46] *** jpn joined
[14:46] <guifa_> I'm going to probably end up having too much fun with it

[14:46] <guifa_> haha

[14:47] <guifa_> so far I'm not doing anything too crazy, just creating a sub and organizing some code for the formatters

[14:48] <Xliff> Is some of it online, anywhere?

[14:51] *** jpn left
[15:00] <guifa_> not yet, I just started the rework process right after doing the advent calendar posts

[15:00] <guifa_> I've already hit some structurs that don't have test files in, so I'm going to try to make some of those as I go

[15:00] <guifa_> maybe also start documenting for end users too

[15:01] *** equinox joined
[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Are you working on RakuAST or "just" documenting?

[15:02] <guifa_> Anton: I'm not doing core work: just using it for some of my modules.  But for stuff where I can help (writing test files), I'll try to pitch in where I can

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Your RakuAST advent post was/is very helpful, BTW...

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see -- great! I need RakuAST in order to "finish" my Mathematica interpreter (Raku.)

[15:04] <guifa_> I've been holding off on rewriting Intl::Format::DateTime for RakuAST to get into main

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> guifa_++

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Today, I am trying to figure out how should I rewrite my grammar-based random sentence generator using RakuAST. (I might not do it, and decide its current state is just fine.)

[15:05] <guifa_> I could make it probably 2-3x as fast, but didn't want to put in the work just yet.  And then I realized if I do the number formatter first

[15:05] <guifa_> I could add an rakuast sub option so I could actually grab the RakuAST from the number formatter, and fully integrate it into the date (or unit) formatter

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> unfortunately I couldn't build a new rakudo on this machine today

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wanted to check out default values for `my Int &foo` kind of calls

[15:07] * guifa_ needs a new keyboard

[15:07] <guifa_> oops ww but is still true lol

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I cannot install "Intl::Format::DateTime" on my mac.

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I very curios about the date-time formatting, since a big part of my "data science work" is working with- and plotting time series.

[15:12] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[15:16] <guifa_> Anton: I'll revisit it, I've updated so many modules in the Intl ecosystem there's a solid chance something has gone off somewhere

[15:17] <guifa_> I'm working from the core (Intl::LanguageTag) outwards with much more modern rewrites and (esp. for formatting) RakuAST

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see -- good luck!

[15:18] <guifa_> hopefully within a month or so everything will stabilize and updates won't break anything

[15:31] <guifa_> Anton: it looks like it might be an easy fix.  I'll take a look at it in an hour or so.  Since the module is on github/p6c only (not moved to fez), it's trying to install an old version of Intl::CLDR that seems to be borked a bit

[15:32] <guifa_> I'll try updating the META6 to force it to use the fez versions

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I have a dozen 60-to-80% finished blog post and articles. I feel I have to "wrap them up"  (and post them) in order to move on (onto other ideas.)

[20:01] <guifa_> weird

[20:02] <guifa_> I'm getting a SIGSEGV when running my DateTime::Timezones now

[20:05] <guifa_> exit code 139, though I can't decode that, caused on self.bless(‚Ä¶), let me see if I can golf this

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa So, at this point, you only tried to baseball it?

[20:11] <guifa_> m: class DateTime is DateTime { method new {¬†self.bless() }¬†}; my $a = DateTime.new

[20:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar cdc9aa987: ( no output )

[20:12] <guifa_> m: class DateTime is DateTime { method new { say "new new"; self.bless() } }; my $a = DateTime.new

[20:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar cdc9aa987: OUTPUT: ¬´new new‚ê§¬ª

[20:13] <guifa_> basically I'm getting it whn calling a self.bless in a structure like that

[20:17] *** jpn joined
[20:18] <guifa_> ah no, it's when calling CORE::DateTime

[20:18] <guifa_> m: class DateTime is DateTime { method new { CORE::DateTime.now() } }; my $a = DateTime.new

[22:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Date-time-wise : I am very interested to get a good natural language parser of date and time intervals in Portuguese. (So far I have done those just in English.)

[22:38] <guifa_> so my next-next-next project is a DateTime token

[22:39] <guifa_> I had an intl number token that already works (at least, last time I looked at it)
