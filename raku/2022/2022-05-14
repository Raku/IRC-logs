[09:07] <Xliff> Are there any docs for .^can?

[09:08] <Xliff> OK, that's the wrong one. What method can I use to determine if a method candidate can accept a given parameter?

[09:16] <lizmat> do you know the candidate ?

[18:08] <Xliff> gfldex: Thanks! I did manage to figure out it was .cando I was looking for.

[18:08] <Xliff> BTW - Nice article.

[18:09] <Xliff> Using decomposition to pull out public attributes of a class was a feature I didn't know about.

[22:11] <[Coke]> is there a way to specify a rakudo (not raku) version in META6.json?

[22:11] <[Coke]> Apparently there is a restriction on the raku doc build process that pins us at 2022.03 at the moment.
