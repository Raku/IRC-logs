[01:15] <ToddAndMargo> anyone on newbie duty?  Is there an escape for "while" and "until" loops?  Sort of like  "last" for "for" loops,

[01:16] <moon-child> last should work just fine

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> my $x = 0;

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> while $x <= 10 {

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     $x = prompt 'Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: ';

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     say "You entered $x.";

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     if $x eq 3  { last; }

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> }

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> say "$x is bigger than 10.";

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 2

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: 4

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> You entered 4.

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: 3

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> You entered 3.

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 3 is bigger than 10.

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> > 6

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 6

[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> tried `$x == 3` too

[01:20] <ToddAndMargo> 11 do not escape either

[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> wait.  I was misreading the output. "last" worked fine.

[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> Thank you for the help!

[01:22] <Voldenet> actually no problem

[01:24] *** rbt joined
[01:28] <Voldenet> btw, in your case it might be saner to use `loop` instead of while

[01:28] <Voldenet> > loop { my $x = prompt("x: "); say "$x is greater than 10" if $x > 10; last if $x == 3 }

[13:27] <[Coke]> if by side effect you mean "default value", it's literally part of the language.

[13:28] <[Coke]> OH! you don't, you mean *fluca's* signature, not lizmat's. Whoops!

[13:28] * [Coke] is hopefully caught up now

[13:29] * lizmat clickbaits https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/04/11/2022-15-wordling/

[13:29] * [Coke] guesses that lizmat++ is the longest running newsletter generator for raku/perl 6 at this point.

[13:30] <lizmat> I guess about 7 years now?

[20:44] <Xliff> Does TIOBE track Raku use?

[20:48] <lizmat> it does afaik

[20:48] <lizmat> it's one of the reasons I always mention "the Raku Programming Language" at least once in the weekly :-)

[20:49] <El_Che> i rememeber raku entering at 93

[20:51] <Xliff> Ah, OK.

[20:51] <Voldenet> according to tiobe RPG and ABAP are more popular than bash and typescript is less popular than Awk

[20:51] <Voldenet> I'd really take those ratings with grain of salt
