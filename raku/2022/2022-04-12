[01:15] <ToddAndMargo> anyone on newbie duty?  Is there an escape for "while" and "until" loops?  Sort of like  "last" for "for" loops,
[01:16] <moon-child> last should work just fine
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> my $x = 0;
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> while $x <= 10 {
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     $x = prompt 'Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: ';
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     say "You entered $x.";
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo>     if $x eq 3  { last; }
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> }
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> say "$x is bigger than 10.";
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 2
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: 4
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> You entered 4.
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> Enter a number, which is not bigger than 10: 3
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> You entered 3.
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 3 is bigger than 10.
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> > 6
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> 6
[01:19] <ToddAndMargo> tried `$x == 3` too
[01:20] <ToddAndMargo> 11 do not escape either
[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> wait.  I was misreading the output. "last" worked fine.
[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> Thank you for the help!
[01:22] <Voldenet> actually no problem
[01:24] *** rbt joined
[01:28] <Voldenet> btw, in your case it might be saner to use `loop` instead of while
[01:28] <Voldenet> > loop { my $x = prompt("x: "); say "$x is greater than 10" if $x > 10; last if $x == 3 }

[01:57] <ToddAndMargo> I wanted both for my keepers file
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo> This is what I did with it:
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>       while $Page < 21  {
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>          my Str $WebSitePage = $WebSite ~ "?page=" ~ "$Page";
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>          if  CurlExists( $WebSitePage )  {
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>             ( $WebPage, $PageStatus ) = CurlGetWebSite( $WebSitePage, True );
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>             if $WebPage.contains( "Release v" ) {
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>                if $Debug  { PrintGreen "$SubName\: WebSite = <$WebSitePage>\n"; }
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>                $ReleaseFound = True;
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>                last;
[01:57] <ToddAndMargo>             } # contains
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo>          } # if curl exists
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo>          $Page += 1;
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo>       } # while
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo>       # if $WebPage.contains( "Release v" )  {
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo>       if $ReleaseFound  {
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> these two woudl be nice: my int $Page = 1;
[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> my bool, $ReleaseFound = False;
[02:04] <Voldenet> fyi, if you don't use pastebin for large chunks of code, people could get mad at you later
[02:05] <ToddAndMargo> ops.  Thanks for the tip
[02:07] <Voldenet> and you don't really have to track $ReleaseFound
[02:08] <Voldenet> ofc it depends on what you are trying to do, but "No value" is also a correct value
[02:10] <Voldenet> m: sub find-release($page) returns Int { if $page eq "a" { return 42 }; return Int }; for "a", "b" { if my $rel = find-release($_) { say $rel } else { say "no value" }}
[02:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «42␤no value␤»
[02:10] <Voldenet> consider this
[02:10] <ToddAndMargo> If $ReleaseFound triggers a bunch of stuff on the web page I downloaded.  I suppose I could put all that stuff in the loop, but I was modifying a kluge and let me keep the original code in place.  Originally, I was using if elseif over and over.  It is not pretty.
[02:12] <Voldenet> In your case then webpage can be a (Str) or an actual value
[02:13] <ToddAndMargo> love subs!  Thank you!  Once I know what ?page  "release v" occures on, them it is regex time

[02:17] <ToddAndMargo> The buzzards mix their nightlies and betas together.  So itis fun to find what page they put their latest general release on
[02:28] <Voldenet> you know, you could've just used github api
[02:28] <Voldenet> > https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/releases?per_page=10
[02:28] <Voldenet> set per_page to whatever insane value you want, there's also page variable
[02:32] <ToddAndMargo> Hmmm.  So they tell me how many pages they have.   Thank you!   May just be easier to use "CurlExists".  https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/releases shows 29 pages.

[07:45] *** fluca1978 joined
[07:46] <fluca1978> When checking a MAIN argument, I had a program that emitted a warn. This was working on ancient rakudo, e.g., 2020.01, but not on recent ones. Something like this: sub MAIN( Str :$dir where { .so && .IO.d // warn "Specify the directory [$dir]" } )
[07:47] <fluca1978> is there a way to emit the warn without having raku to complain for an empty string if the argument is not specified?

[08:13] *** jjido joined
[08:23] <Voldenet> I know it's uncool, but `sub MAIN(IO:D() :$dir) { unless $dir.d { warn "Specify the directory [$dir]"; }; }` is saner
[08:27] <Voldenet> also, signatures having side effects is probably not something desirable

[13:27] <[Coke]> if by side effect you mean "default value", it's literally part of the language.
[13:28] <[Coke]> OH! you don't, you mean *fluca's* signature, not lizmat's. Whoops!
[13:28] * [Coke] is hopefully caught up now
[13:29] * lizmat clickbaits https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/04/11/2022-15-wordling/
