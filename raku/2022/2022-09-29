[07:24] <ramesh> Should I learn perl 5 or Raku? I have just started.

[07:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It depends. Currently, I'd say there are two things Perl is fundamentally better at.

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 1. backwards-compatibility and accessibility overall. These were the main concerns that resulted in the split in the first place so while Raku was about trying to fix things, Perl moves very slowly and carefully, so that something from 30 years ago will still work.

[07:35] <smol-hors> they're both cool but my fav is Raku

[07:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 2. performance. I'm not sure how much this is intrinsic to the design (hopefully not too much) but as it stands, Perl is way faster and can be compiled to native code. If you want to compete with other mainstream scripting languages regarding speed right here and right now, Perl is ready for that while Raku is not.

[07:39] *** Sgeo left
[07:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What you get in return is: 1. an overall much more versatile and outsider-friendly language 2. generally much more willingness to move things forward and change things if necessary

[07:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Depending on what is your thing, you might like minor details like raku has a REPL and it can generate decent CLI from the signature of the MAIN subroutine

[07:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Or the zef/fez macroverse over oldschool CPAN

[07:43] *** MoC joined
[07:43] *** ramesh left
[07:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> For the performance: iirc Perl is actually written in C. Now, if you know some C (perhaps any language with binary compatibility?), Raku has great FFI tools and you can do the heavy lifting with a C dynamic library.

[07:51] *** ramesh joined
[07:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Raku also has actual object model and multiple dispatch over types/custom conditions

[07:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think I couldn't switch to Perl even if I wanted, I'd miss too much of Raku üòÑ

[07:55] <ramesh> Thank you for the detailed information. I appreciate.

[18:34] <lizmat> gfldex: but what is the point of storing the substitution if it is discarded ?

[18:36] <gfldex> I would never rule out the possibility to find use for a Raku idiom. Mostly, because I'm not smart enough to contain the whole of Raku in my head.

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> Is there a way to get a manually written multi method to work alongside the an autogenerated field accessor? Na√Øvely this is what I tried: `class Investment { has Rat $.balance; multi method balance(Investment:U: --> Rat) { 0.0 } }`

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> `s/the an/an/`

[19:21] <xinming> m: class Investment { has Rat $.balance; multi method balance(Investment:D: --> Rat) { 1.0 }; multi method balance(Investment:U: --> Rat) { 0.0 }; }; Investment.balance.say; Investment.new.balance.say;

[19:30] <ugexe> "...to work alongside the an autogenerated field accessor?"

[19:30] *** linkable6 joined
[19:31] <gfldex> The autogenerated accessor is of no help, because it isn't a multi. I believe Rog was missing `is built` to make it work.

[19:35] <lizmat> fwiw, you can create your own methods, even if the attribute is public

[19:36] <lizmat> the accessors are created *after* a class is parsed and only for those attributes that don't have an accessor yet

[19:37] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.foo; method foo() { "bar" } }; my $a = A.new(foo => 42); dd $a; dd $a.foo

[19:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: ¬´A $a = A.new(foo => 42)‚ê§"bar"‚ê§¬ª
