[16:49] <andinus> is there a guide to packaging XS modules ?

[16:52] <andinus> ingy: https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/blob/master/lib/Fez/CLI.rakumod#L204 -- you can do these manually

[16:54] <lizmat> XS ?   You mean NativeCall ??  

[16:56] <andinus> yes

[16:56] *** morte_` joined
[16:57] <andinus> the C library is also included with the raku module

[16:57] *** spacekookie left
[16:58] <andinus> C++*

[16:58] *** morte_ left
[16:58] <lizmat> I believe Inline::Perl5 has a similar situation, with a small C wrapper being needed

[16:58] <lizmat> perhaps that can give you some inspiration

[16:58] <andinus> i see, i'll check that out

[16:59] <lizmat> personally, all of the NativeCall I've done, just used the C lib or installed libraries

[16:59] <lizmat> *C standard lib

[16:59] <andinus> i see

[20:09] <ingy> lizmat: I don't think it's fair to say that I always want the easy way :\

[20:10] <ingy> I just made this project public https://github.com/ingydotnet/pst

[20:10] <ingy> Which required learning inane details about 35+ languages

[20:11] <lizmat> looks like a cool project

[20:12] <ingy> Thanks. Should make it easy for me to do a lot more raku publishing.

[20:13] <lizmat> well, I was a bit grumpy at the time and the remark "I guess I'll look in the fez code and see what it's doing. I just thought I could get a quicker answer here :)" pushed the wrong button

[20:13] <ingy> noted. it's how over there I hear...

[20:13] <ingy> *hot

[20:14] <lizmat> yeah, 33 today and tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday

[20:14] <lizmat> :-(

[20:14] <ingy> bleh

[20:14] <ingy> I only asked that after fighting with zef/fez stuff for an hour

[20:15] <lizmat> next week, it's going tp drop to about 27 with rain  ...  so it'll turn more Amazon like instead of more Sahara like at the moment

[20:15] <ingy> I'll have some issues/prs for tonyo soon enough :D

[20:15] <lizmat> issues are good, PRs are better :-)

[20:45] <lizmat> hehe... I know

[20:46] <lizmat> but for here, 5 days of 30+ is pretty uncommon

[20:46] <lizmat> although not as uncommon as it used to be :-(
