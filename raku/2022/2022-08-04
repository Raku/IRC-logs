[12:08] <[Coke]> tbrowder: https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/master/writing-docs/EXAMPLES.md

[12:12] <tbrowder> thnx, just went there and see the :prefix thing, will try that

[12:14] <[Coke]> the test failures on the PR are because of a change I made, though

[12:15] <tbrowder> uh, :preamble

[12:15] <tbrowder> oh!

[12:17] <[Coke]> if you ran 'TEST_FILES="file you changed" make xtest' that's what we ask.

[12:17] <[Coke]> This was the File -> FileSystem change; I thought I didn't need the protective version to get either, but I did.

[12:18] <[Coke]> if someone wants to fix that (https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/74508673dd5015bef1daee78c7c2481a5b80729) go ahead, else I'll get to it this evening

[12:18] <tbrowder> no, i just did "make html; make xtest

[12:21] <tbrowder> i'll try the RIGHT way, get it working, and update the pr

[12:21] <tbrowder> thnx

[13:35] <[Coke]> you don't need to run 'make html' before 'make xtest'

[13:36] <[Coke]> None of the tests depend on the built site - so you might find something in there, but it doesn't do anything extra for the test run

[13:36] <[Coke]> and specifying the "files you changed" env var just makes the tests run faster.

[18:44] <Xliff> Is there a Raku module that can deserialize PHP serialized data?

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Xliff: you may wish to try cpan PHP::Serialization with Inline::Perl5 ...

[18:59] *** pamplemousse joined
[19:03] <AlexDaniel> .

[19:03] <Xliff> p6-steve: Looked into that. Decodes into a Buf which I can't do anything with. It doesn't seem to work with Raku's decode.

[19:03] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to p6steve

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> a, interesting

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> melezhik: thanks for letting me know, I think it works now and it's fixed for good

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> e: say 42

[19:05] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 36b0a635f: OUTPUT: Â«42â¤Â»

[19:05] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[20:43] <Xliff> Anyone know of a decent way to parse this string? "Please Delete My Existing Data (\"Right To Be Forgotten\")."

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> into what format?

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Xliff: I have test driven here https://gist.github.com/p6steve/afdfaae596038361e79579345e4f2c08

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Xliff: looks OK to me if you have all the pieces installed (perllib-dev, cpanm, PHP::Serialize, Inline::Perl5)

[21:05] *** pamplemousse left
[21:23] <Xliff> Neomkosch: Need to write a regex to parse it.

[21:24] <Xliff> p6steve: I did get that far, however it appears that the string I am tryig to parse fails the deserializer.,

[21:24] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to p6steve

[21:24] <Xliff> I got that far and further. Thanks for the code snippet, though.

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> How parse it, though? What should be the parts?

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Xliff: I see, seems like you have covered that base ...

[22:01] <Xliff> Nemokosch: How do I parse that whole string as a string?

[22:21] <Xliff> How can I make a dynamic regex rule?
