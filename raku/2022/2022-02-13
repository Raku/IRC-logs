[14:03] <[Coke]> still working on that bisect on windows. near the end, ran into a different issue where zef install is saying "extraction ok" and then just stopping. hopefully I can still get to the root of the original issue with these skips.

[14:04] <[Coke]> also: when using chrome remot desktop to open a connection to my mac to run tmux with irssi in it... hitting control w to delete a word does not have the intended effect. I have done this dozens of times over this weekend, oops. (almost just did it againt in this send.)

[16:58] <nine> Voldenet: in that specific example, you may be able to access Pair.a via trickery. But in general NativeCall doesn't support this use case yet. You may have to use a wrapper library written in C that puts this structure onto the heap and returns a pointer

[16:58] <Voldenet> Yeah, that's the workaround I use

[16:58] <Voldenet> malloc, memcpy and pointer

[16:59] <Voldenet> â€¦and the trickery would be using int64 I suppose

[16:59] <Voldenet> or Pointer

[16:59] <nine> exactly

[17:43] <guifa> lizmat: with RAST's maturation, will traits be passed compiled stuff or will they have access to the RAST? Or will there potentially be a different way to get at the AST? (maybe a different trait_mod keyword?)

[17:44] <lizmat> guifa: good question...

[17:44] <lizmat> I have no idea, really

[17:44] <lizmat> I guess initially jnthn will want to go for the least amount of change

[17:45] <lizmat> so I don't think you'll be able to do more then

[17:45] <lizmat> and once there are macros, some of the trait_mod stuff may be obsolete anyway

[17:45] <guifa> Yeah, OT1H, keeping them receiving compiled won't break anything.  OTOH, there's some really cool stuff one could do accessing the AST

[17:49] *** nebuchadnezzar left
[17:51] * guifa was just thinking about JS's old asm.js, using a subset of JS that can be hyper optimized, and how Raku might pull off similar

[17:54] <lizmat> you're thinking something akin to miniperl ?

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Who is this raiph? ðŸ¥´

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, I can be informal or overly formal if need be, since this is no place for personal drama, let me just say: as long as the participants of discussions don't know each other, let's respect the others' effort when writing comments and stay away from stackoverflow-quality 2 liners

[21:36] <guifa> Nemokosch: what's this in reference to?  That raiph would write a 2liner seemsâ€¦Â very out of character

[21:36] * guifa used to think he was long winded until he saw raiph's chapter-long answers to questions

[21:50] <ugexe> i think maybe if you had given them more than day they might have followed through on their original commitment of replying in a thorough manner. two sentences from raiph are generally followed by 20+ more

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm not setting any deadlines for anyone

[21:56] <ugexe> You were implying he needed to respond with something you found meaningful, and the fact he had not done so already had upset you

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> On the other hand, I do find it disrespectful that people are making effort in order to investigate something and you just go there to post something irrelevant

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so no, he didn't need to respond in the first place

[21:57] <ugexe> you are tilting at windmills

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but if he does, it should hit some minimal niveau just out of respect, in my opinion

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and what are those windmills?

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that someone responds on topic?
