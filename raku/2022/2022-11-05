[06:32] <CIAvash> regarding the advent blog and use of markdown, if people want, I can create an advent blog on raku-lang.ir/en and maybe use CNAME records and/or something like to show the blog at your domain of choice. Just a thought.

[11:00] <lizmat> although nothing has changed in that area, and it installs from fez without issues

[11:00] <lizmat> feels like a bug in fez prefixing the release string ?

[13:26] <tbrowder> CIAvash: i’m getting a 404 on that link

[13:27] <CIAvash> Needs a redirect: https://www.raku-lang.ir/en/

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@755062053282119803> I uploaded to raku.land the new version of "Markdown::Grammar" that has the fix of code block issue.

[14:05] <tbrowder> it works fine, thnx!

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@755062053282119803> Great -- thanks!

[14:27] <guifa_> o/

[14:28] * guifa_ is trying to think of an idea for Advent calendar

[14:30] <rir>   ^ Being ignorant of-- I suggest: v6.e preview highlights.

[14:35] <guifa_> I mean RakuAST is amazing and that's the main thing I'm using from it but I don't want to take away thunder from those who have put work into it on the dev side

[14:37] *** razetime joined
[14:37] <rir> ^ Nemokosch's little preview 22:20 ago (00:15:46 after the hour) seemed a little arcane for this unwashed mass, but hashes are weird.

[14:41] <rir> @guifa, I meant the PREVIEW stuff in 6.e.  Also, ask, perhaps a dev would rather dump the task on you.

[14:42] <rir> s/the task/some task/

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> rir: what are you thinking of?

[14:46] <rir>  guifa_'s recent comment and your code of yesterday: use v6.e.PREVIEW; my \bar = "lol"; my %foo; %foo<bar>{||<this that other>} = "demo";

[14:46] <guifa_> ah that's a good one to talk about

[14:46] <guifa_> I once had to create my own postfix operator to do that because I was using it in a codebase frequently enough

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh right

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's mentioned every now and then, useful stuff

[14:52] <rir> Well, I was saying weird, because I expect its effect is simpler to anticipate with Positionals or Cools, if applicatable. 

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> mehh, DST change tomorrow in the US

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> meaning that Raku Study group will be at the usual time here, not one hour earlier. oof

[14:54] * guifa_ should probably have DateTime::React running to check to make sure it works correctly :-)

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> will DST eliminated in the US as well?

[14:58] *** jjido joined
[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> here it's a common topic for years, I heard now they talk about this occasion finally being the last one

[14:58] <guifa_> there's always people pushing for it but no legislation has passed at the federal level

[14:58] <guifa_> some individual states don't have it tho

[14:58] <guifa_> where I am we are still doing it

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is an old saying in Tennessee... I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, I'm only "aligned" with California for the time being

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > lambert lum is looking for raku speakers for svperl on Jan 5, 2023

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do yall know anything about this?

[15:20] <rir> DST is a national law.  Arizona and Hawaii opted out.  Accidents rise after both changes.

[15:44] *** razetime left
[15:47] *** jjido left
[16:11] *** irc_user left
[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Any links supporting that statement?

[17:02] *** Sgeo joined

[17:23] *** sena_kun left
[17:29] <guifa_> Per the Uniform Time Act, states and territories can either opt into DST (in which case they must do it on the standard dates in the US) or opt out.  The more complicated change is if a state or part of a state wants to move to a different time zone — that must be approved by the USDOT

[17:30] <guifa_> Indiana, for instance, opted in in 2007

[17:31] <guifa_> Because of the same law, American Samoa doesn't, because they'd be required to do a reverse DST (falling forwarding and springing back which doesn't make much sense).  

[17:31] <guifa_> Actually none of the non-States follow it except for DC

[17:34] <guifa_> Technically the senate has passed legislation that would put us permanently on DST but it's worthless without the house passing similar, so … no changes and I doubt with it being an election year that they'll touch it

[17:36] * guifa_ concludes his DST history lesson lol

[19:59] <rir> Ha! Sounds like the senators don't like D.C, it seems inconvenient to differ from your suburbs and other neighbors.

[20:02] <guifa_> we don't differ — we're just not a state :-) 

[20:05] <rir> Yes, but the senators voted for permanent DST.
