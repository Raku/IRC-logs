[12:26] <lizmat> somehow it had de-highlighted #cro for me already :-(

[12:27] <tbrowder> mi6 users should check my PR. it enables you to specify a second rakudoc file to be converted to Markdown. very useful for more detailed information on your repo for web browsing.

[12:29] <tbrowder> and you can ping skaji if you like it--i need it :-D

[12:29] <lizmat> tbrowder: only a second?

[12:30] <lizmat> why not have it convert all .rakudoc files in a doc directory ?

[12:30] <tbrowder> for now. i couldn't easily figure out skaji's code. but yes i would like that, too. this is more of a test

[12:30] <lizmat> or something like that ?

[12:31] <tbrowder> you are welcome to mod the PR

[12:31] <lizmat> I have too many of those already  :-)

[12:32] <tbrowder> but i think this pr can stand alone anyway

[12:35] <tbrowder>  there is one glitch on the pr: i had to comment out one of his tests because it fails on me (even without my pr). testing mi6 involves its "xt" directory and i had trouble creating my own pr's test.

[12:36] <tbrowder> but my test is working, as are all skaji's tests but one

[12:39] <tbrowder> note my pr uses the "barename" of the second rakudoc to name the markdown file which placed in the base directory with the README

[12:39] <tbrowder> *is placed

[12:42] <tbrowder> with my pr, skaji could create a separate doc to tell pr submitters the correct way to test mi6!

[12:46] <lizmat> not sure :-(

[12:52] <Kaiepi> the implementation doesn't seem to have changed since way back in 2012 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/64a2e8359874ead1abdd8724ce6389346bef2d65

[12:53] <Kaiepi> bar some role stuff in C3MRO iirc

[12:58] <xinming> Anyone here uses  DBIish:ver<0.6.5> getting error 'DBDish::Pg: Can't connect: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly' randomly?

[12:59] <xinming> On the postgresql server, I can get error which is "could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer"

[12:59] <xinming> Is there a way to make this error more verbose for easier troubleshooting?

[12:59] <Kaiepi> try wireshark

[13:00] <Kaiepi> there's --ll-exception ig

[13:00] <xinming> Kaiepi: were you answering my question?

[13:00] <Kaiepi> i say that because it seems a bit like a dns problem

[13:00] <Kaiepi> yes

[13:00] <xinming> Ok

[13:01] <Kaiepi> see if it ever tries localhost on ipv4

[13:04] <xinming> https://termbin.com/l8t9    <--- This is the ll-exception

[13:05] <xinming> hmm, Let me use a local source instead

[13:10] <xinming> https://termbin.com/f554e  <--- This is version with checkout source from master

[13:12] <xinming> Kaiepi: How do I use wireshark to troubleshooting the issue in cli?

[13:13] <Kaiepi> there's a tshark tui tool

[13:13] <Kaiepi> er

[13:13] <Kaiepi> just cli

[13:15] <Kaiepi> the connection is handled by libpq. not very familiar with it :(

[13:15] <Kaiepi> seems like hyper/race is involved in some way though. maybe it's not thread-safe?

[13:16] <xinming> I just now removed the ::1 line in /etc/hosts, Seems the *thing* is gone.

[13:16] <xinming> I'll leave it for a while.

[13:17] <xinming> I don't remove the line, I just commented it out, You said it's probably dns issue, So I thought it's probably ipv4/ipv6 mixing issue

[13:18] <Kaiepi> yeah, that's along the lines of what i was thinking

[16:35] <tonyo> looked like his issue was using ipv6

[16:37] <Xliff> Ahh.... Ipv6

[16:37] <Xliff> Yet another tech with great expectations it didn't live up to.

[16:37] <Xliff> The dotted quad still lives.

[16:38] <Xliff> The coloned octal never caught on.

[16:39] <Xliff> I mean seriously, if I have to use the word "Colon" ever again...it will be too soon.

[16:49] <lizmat> .oO( everybody wants the colon :-)

[17:07] <xinming> Xliff: It's not timeouts, I just found now, when I restart the postgresql daemon, The app needs to be restarted again, So I'm thinking wether DBIish have builtin support for reconnect

[17:09] <xinming> Yea, I found it's ipv6 issue, I tried to comment the 127.0.0.1  line in /etc/hosts directly, the ::1 to localhost will also cause connection refused.

[17:21] <tonyo> xinming: i'd use and just auto-reconnect https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-dbpg/blob/master/lib/DB/Pg/Database.rakumod#L85

[17:43] <jdv> more like second system syndrome:)

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Calling it second system syndrome would be as faulty as calling Unix the second system of DOS

[17:53] <jdv> im not aware unix and dos have a strong relation.  plus iirc unix came first, no?

[17:54] <jdv> by a decade or more i think

[17:58] <xinming> tonyo: what is the best way to check the ping for the db connection? before each statement, or periodically

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> DOS is a broader term than Unix even

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> DOS/360 was published in 1966, for example

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also, I don't know what sort of "strong relations" IPv4 and IPv6 have, other than targeting the same problem

[18:06] *** reportable6 left
[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the point was rather, that IPv4 did have reasons to be replaced even 20 years ago but people rather hacked around it until the problems became manageable

[18:07] <jdv> oh wow.  when i think dos i think ibm and ms.  is dos/360 strongly related to the 80s/90s dos?

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I frankly doubt it

[18:09] <jdv> so you think different versions of the same protocol are not strongly related?

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, IPv4 wasn't created with billions of devices on one network in mind

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think it's merely a name - unless proven otherwise, of course.

[18:09] *** reportable6 joined
[18:10] <jdv> im not sure what were talkin about anymore e cept a pissing contest

[18:10] <jdv> fun stuff:)

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't assume deep relations between two "versions" of a term as generic as "internet protocol"

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, let me reiterate the point then

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > the point was rather, that IPv4 did have reasons to be replaced even 20 years ago but people rather hacked around it until the problems became manageable

[18:13] <jdv> ok.  my point was vaguely that ipv6 perhaps went too crazy and divergent.

[18:13] <jdv> thanks for the volley

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, you made me curious; IPv4 (then just IP, I suppose) was developed by DARPA in the seventies while IPv6 was developed by IETF in the nineties. I really don't see why they would be iterations of one product

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> If anything, we can imply that IETF guys weren't as clever as DARPA üôÇ
