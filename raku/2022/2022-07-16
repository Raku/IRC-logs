[08:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> There is something odd with this Hash::Merge module

[08:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it shows up as a CPAN module

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://raku.land/cpan:TYIL/Hash::Merge then it says "The uploading author of cpan:TYIL does not match the META author of github:scriptkitties."

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I tried to install jjatria's Pop engine and it failed on this dependency

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but then I installed it by hand "zef install Hash::Merge" and it succeeded...

[16:39] <melezhik> lizmat I am curious why you have this run-tests scripts for your distros - https://github.com/lizmat/App-Rak/blob/main/run-tests ?

[18:14] <uzl[m]> [Coke]: Could this PR (https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4084) be merged assuming everything is fine? I'm looking to document the other 2022.06 changes wherever I am not out of my depth ðŸ˜…

[18:14] <tellable6> uzl[m], I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[18:15] <uzl[m]> lizmat++ with the weekly!

[18:17] <uzl[m]> I learned about `Empty` being skipped by an iterator from one of codesections's talks, so I am pleasantly surprised to see it mentioned in the Did You Know? section haha

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> very useful

[18:47] <lizmat> melezhik: 2 reasons: faster testing, and more error information *if* there is a test failure / execution error

[18:47] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[18:47] <lizmat> melezhik: also, total clarity about the version of Rakudo that is being used in CI testing

[18:47] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[18:56] <japhb> lizmat: Wouldn't the lines from 35-37 are dead because the streams are merged?

[18:56] <japhb> *be dead

[18:56] <japhb> Nice script, BTW.  Whipuptitude++

[18:57] *** euandreh left
[18:58] <lizmat> japhb: good catch, I think

[18:59] <lizmat> "If $merge is set to True, the standard output and error stream end up merged in $proc.out."   # japhb++

[19:01] <tellable6> 2022-07-16T18:47:45Z #raku <lizmat> melezhik: also, total clarity about the version of Rakudo that is being used in CI testing

[19:02] <melezhik> lizmat I see that, maybe I'll include this into standard tomtit - https://github.com/melezhik/Tomtit/tree/master/resources/profiles

[19:02] <melezhik> so that : `tom --profile raku`

[19:02] <melezhik> to install this

[19:02] <melezhik> and then just `tom raku-tests`

[19:03] <melezhik> or even just `raku raku-test`

[19:04] <melezhik> tom task might only install `raku-tests` into cwd

[19:04] <melezhik> instead of run `raku raku-tests`

[19:05] <melezhik> but it's duscussibale ... anyway ... just a thoughts
