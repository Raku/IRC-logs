[10:44] <gfldex> SmokeMachine: After carefull study of Rakudo, I now understand what you do with subset. There may be a host of cool stuff we can do with that. I shall blog later.

[10:45] <lizmat> there's no goto in Raku either

[10:46] <gfldex> But that doesn't mean Raku couldn't be your go-to language! :->

[11:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> can a postcircumfix operator be hypered as if it was an infix operator?

[11:12] <SmokeMachine> gfldex: please let me know when you blog about it, I'm very interested! :)

[11:17] <gfldex> You are very welcome.

[19:04] <El_Che> lizmat is our unsung hero

[19:04] <Voldenet> That may be a silly question, since it's not documented that it should work like that, but

[19:04] <Voldenet> m: (^5).produce( -> $a, $b { FIRST { take 42 }; $b }).say

[19:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(0 1 2 3 4)␤»

[19:04] <Voldenet> shouldn't this return (0 42 1 2 3 4)?

[19:05] <Voldenet> docs state that produce is an implicit loop after all

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> where is the implicit gather, though?

[19:09] <[Coke]> Voldenet: where do the docs state that?

[19:09] <Voldenet> > https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_produce

[19:09] <Voldenet> > Since produce is an implicit loop, it responds to next, last and redo statements inside &with:

[19:09] <[Coke]> ah, at the very bottom of https://docs.raku.org/routine/produce

[19:09] <Voldenet> using FIRST is outside of scope of this though, that's why it's a silly question

[19:10] <Voldenet> however, it works in map

[19:10] <Voldenet> m: (^5).map(sub ($_) { FIRST { return 42 }; $_ }).say

[19:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(42 1 2 3 4)␤»

[19:10] <Voldenet> m: (^5).produce(sub ($a, $_) { FIRST { return 42 }; $_ }).say

[19:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(0 1 2 3 4)␤»

[19:11] <Voldenet> if you know what first element is, you can cheat though

[19:11] <Voldenet> m: (^5).produce(sub ($a, $_) { if $a == 0 { return 42 }; $_ }).say

[19:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(0 42 2 3 4)␤»

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's really interesting that map and produce don't work the same way

[19:13] <Voldenet> produce uses gather/take and map doesn't

[19:14] *** discord-raku-bot left
[19:15] <Voldenet> m: (^5).produce(sub ($a, $_) { take 42; $_ }).say

[19:15] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[19:18] <guifa> it might be using it internally, but I don't it's something you should rely upon

[19:20] <Voldenet> Yes, definitely not, especially if docs say nothing about it

[19:26] <Voldenet> …in fact, FIRST/LAST work weird in map

[19:26] <Voldenet> m: (^5).map(sub ($_) { FIRST { return 42 }; $_ }).say

[19:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(42 1 2 3 4)␤»

[19:26] <Voldenet> m: (^5).map(sub ($_) { LAST { return 42 }; $_ }).say

[19:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Attempt to return outside of immediately-enclosing Routine (i.e. `return` execution is outside the dynamic scope of the Routine where `return` was used)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:28] <Voldenet> It's weird code nobody sane would write anyway, normal people would just use gather/take for anything complex
