[08:33] <perlsol> Hi, can you believe... I only now just found out about Raku!!! And I have been a perl head since 2000...omg

[08:42] <lizmat> perlsol: welcome  :-)

[08:43] <perlsol> Which leads me to a question... I develop anything and everything with perl but it has become increasingly difficult linking to modern resources... For example, my next task is to build a responsive website linked to a corp. outlook calendar, after looking at from a visual studio angle first i'd decided to close that and open my notepad++ and go

[08:43] <perlsol> back to perl, problem is... The lack of updated modules making life hard.

[08:46] <perlsol> Thus the question I have is, are the raku modules recent

[08:46] *** Nemokosch joined
[08:46] <perlsol> Hi lizmat

[08:47] <lizmat> perlsol: well, the oldest module in the ecosystem is about 13 years old, and the newest is from last week I believe  :-)

[08:48] <lizmat> https://raku.land is where you'd look

[08:48] <Nemokosch> perlsol: this is a constant work-in-progress

[08:48] <Nemokosch> the tools are available, the people are enthusiastic - only there could be more of them

[08:54] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o lizmat

[08:54] <perlsol> I thought perl was dead, spent all these years playing perl and sort of feeling alone as other languages moved on... So please to read this today, very shocked I hadn't found out sooner... An announcement on cpan would be helpfull in getting more numbers, i'm onboard so you just gained another one at leastüòä

[08:55] <Nemokosch> that's nice :)

[08:58] *** lizmat sets mode: +v Nemokosch

[08:59] *** lizmat sets mode: -v Nemokosch

[09:01] <perlsol> Thanks for your responses, will check back here soon

[09:59] <tonyo> hmm, thought there was something

[09:59] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to tonyo

[10:00] <lizmat> looks like it's working from this side

[10:00] <tonyo> oh, found it - tbrowder working on your libcsv stuff for the next couple of hours, including GH actions

[10:00] <tonyo> i guess one of the glowing-bear tabs picked it up and weechat stopped alerting

[10:45] *** abraxxa left
[11:05] <tonyo> tbrowder: you're aware that csv_write in libcsv is used to escape one field? are you looking for an interface to send, say, a []hash and get the world's most beautiful CSV?

[12:24] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[12:31] <tbrowder> well, that would be cool. so far i've only used it for reading and its interface is a bit easier than CSV::Parser for my coding use and style. the main problem for me at the moment is getting the mi6 workflow to work for testing. i haven't yet been successfull moding it to work.

[12:31] <tbrowder> consequently, my modules that use it fail testing.

[12:33] <El_Che> another ban?

[12:33] <tbrowder> i am considering creating a new module that wraps CSV::Parser to get a style for my own use.

[12:36] *** epony joined
[12:37] <tbrowder> .tell perlsol speaking only for myself: file issues if updates or new features are needed. i love having users. also see the modules wanted repo

[12:37] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to perlsol

[12:51] <tonyo> ?

[12:52] <tonyo> tbrowder: would be interested in your thoughts on an interface, it's on my radar to make CSV::Parser faster now that i'm a little more nqp fluent.  i have code in the repo to allow you to quote a field and another to take an array of array[Str-able] and will make a CSV for you

[13:00] <tbrowder> ok, i think there might be a comment there already, but i'll look and add a bit. i think a year or so ago we talked about it here. it may not be in either repo,

[13:01] <tbrowder> it might be later today, some other stuff to do...

[13:01] <lizmat> OOC, what is wrong with Text::CSV in this picture ?

[13:04] *** simcop2387 left
[13:04] *** perlbot left
[13:04] <tonyo> no worries tbrowder , updating libcsv repo to use GH actions (you can use .github/workflows/libcsv.yml as a template) and you now have an interface for write-file

[13:07] <tonyo> tbrowder: https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-libcsv/blob/master/.github/workflows/libcsv.yml

[13:11] <tonyo> lizmat: dunno if you mean why i'd revamp but CSV::Parser can handle binary and arbitrary length delimiter|quote|line-sep

[13:12] <lizmat> I thnk Text::CSV can as well ?   

[13:15] <tbrowder> Text::CSV seems not to be testing for one thing, at least no green tag. Also, it's more complicated than I need when I'm the one creating my own CSV files. No doubt it's one to use with stranger CSV files.

[13:15] <tonyo> ah, it didn't used to

[13:16] <tonyo> last time i checked, though, was about 10 years ago - CSV::Parser was my first raku mod

[13:16] <lizmat> I see.. well, Text::CSV was Tux's first Raku module as well  :-)

[13:17] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o lizmat

[13:18] *** razetime left
[13:18] <tonyo> which came first, Text::CSV or Slang::Tux ?

[13:18] <lizmat> Slang::Tuxic was a prereq for Tux to work on Text::CSV

[13:18] *** razetime joined
[13:19] <El_Che> :)

[13:19] <lizmat> so Slang::Tuxic  :-)

[13:19] <El_Che> fix the pet peeve first, then the itch :)

[13:19] <lizmat> it was more like a bet  :-)

[13:19] <lizmat> that Tux was glad to lose  :-)

[13:19] <El_Che> big of him

[13:20] <El_Che> iirc it was a whitespace thing?

[13:20] * El_Che googles

[13:21] * El_Che giggles

[13:21] <tonyo> oh that's right

[13:22] <El_Che> this made me laugh as wel:

[13:23] <El_Che> Hillel

[13:23] <El_Che> @hillelogram

[13:23] <El_Che> ¬∑

[13:23] <El_Che> 8h

[13:23] <El_Che> Gen-Z programmers are always chasing the new shiny thing like Tailwind and Svelte instead of learning CS fundamentals, like React

[13:23] <lizmat> yeah, also, allowing whitespace between object and method:  foo .bar

[13:23] <El_Che> oops, sorry for multiline paste

[13:23] <lizmat> but Larry decreed that to be ok at some point

[13:26] <Voldenet> you're wrong

[13:26] <Voldenet> jquery is obviously cs fundamentals

[13:27] <El_Che> for cs archelogists :)

[13:28] *** simcop2387 joined
[13:28] <Voldenet> you can write react as jquery plugin, but jquery can't work in react

[13:28] <Voldenet> it's obvious which is fundamental
