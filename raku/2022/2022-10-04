[12:03] <tbrowder> can anyone show how to dynamically create a Callable object? i would like to be able to create formatter callables to use with DateTime objects.

[12:04] <lizmat> before RakuAST lands, EVAL is really the only option, if I understand you correctly

[14:01] <tonyo> tbrowder: do you have a syntax you're trying to get specifically?

[14:03] <tonyo> you can do stuff like:

[14:03] <tonyo> m: class A { method gist { "a!" } }; my $b = class :: is A { method gist { "b!" } }; A.new.say; $b.say

[14:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 30a9d3a40: OUTPUT: «a!␤b!␤»

[14:06] <tbrowder> tonyo: i'll put it in a gist. are you gonna be around a few more minutes?

[14:07] *** lichtkind left
[14:10] <tonyo> yea

[14:10] <tonyo> day is just starting

[14:26] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[14:28] <[Coke]> TIL about 'tmux capture-pane', nifty

[14:35] <tbrowder> tonyo: the gist: https://gist.github.com/tbrowder/ac1857907d75ab7150b268c27e9f15cc

[14:36] <tonyo> tbrowder: that should already work with a few tweaks, you just want that in a class form?  

[14:36] <tonyo> actually, that should just work (thought self was referring to class instance)

[14:38] <tbrowder> i have solved my immediate problem by generating the code with a raku program. it's a known set i need for now, but to be able to create them dynamically would be cool!

[14:38] <tonyo> m: class A { method info { "A.info" }; }; my $f = sub ($s) { sprintf "got:%s", .info given $s }; say $f(A.new);

[14:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 30a9d3a40: OUTPUT: «got:A.info␤»

[14:39] <tonyo> tbrowder: ^

[14:39] <El_Che> will Vadim course be recorded? (aka no time now, but maybe interesting later)?

[14:41] <El_Che> is it me or it's been a while since the last raku release?

[14:43] <tonyo> if you want to do it with a class at runtime, given you'll know what formatter you want on object instantiation:

[14:44] <tonyo> m: class A {  has $.num = 0; has $!formatter; method formatter() { $!formatter() }; submethod TWEAK(|) { $!formatter = self.num < 10 ?? sub { "<10" } !! sub { ">=10" }; } }; A.new(:num(10)).formatter.say; A.new(:num(5)).formatter.say;

[14:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 30a9d3a40: OUTPUT: «>=10␤<10␤»

[14:45] <[Coke]> El_Che: if I remember correctly, jdv had an issue running Blin that blocked the release.

[14:45] <El_Che> I see

[14:46] <[Coke]> I had tried a bit to get Blin setup, but I think the directions had some assumptions I missed.

[14:46] <tbrowder> tonyo: very helpful, i'll give it a try, thank you soooo much!

[14:48] <[Coke]> jdv: is there a ticket or gist somewhere with the issue you faced?

[19:47] <jdv> boo

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> seems like -5 is not a <number> token, and eventually not a <value> token in the grammar of Raku

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> quite shocking news imo

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wanted to fix the "arrow return can't be a negative value" issue but I can't destroy half of the known universe on the way...

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's oddly inconsistent if you expect to be able to pass negative constants as function return values

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there even is a "signed integer" token, it's just not a part of numish and consequenty number or value

[21:05] <[Coke]> Blin is using v6.d.PREVIEW - that's out of date, yes?

[21:08] <[Coke]> ok, trying to run Blin with a checkout of Blin next to a checkout of whateverable with "raku -I../whateverable bin/blin.p6" ... I get the same Issue reported here: https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/issues/386

[21:11] *** bpalmer` is now known as bpalmer

[21:22] <guifa_> Nemokosch: I think it should be eventually solvable.  RakuAST in particular would make inserting a negative value there extremely easy

[22:44] <gfldex> I'm not sure if a calendar with less then 12 months would help much. :->

[22:48] <Xliff> It's a single month, silly. :p

[22:49] <Xliff> It can quickly be adapted to do the whole year with very little in the way of change.

[22:49] <Xliff> But then it wouldn't be wise to leave it as a one liner.
