[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I tend to mess up the diplomatics so this time I will just ask, please don't think that what I'm saying is meant in a bad way, more just random feedback
[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so I was reading up on a problem solving issue (<https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/290>) and I bumped into an interesting statement
[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> _We optimize for readers of the code before we optimize for the writers of code._
[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> And I was like... "Really? ðŸ¤” "
[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It absolutely doesn't feel like that to me
[22:25] *** abraxxa-home left
[22:26] *** discord-raku-bot left
[22:26] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> And honestly I even found it a nice trait of Raku that it's insanely prototyping-friendly and you can kind of "vent" with your code
[22:29] <MasterDuke> well, i say that's true compared to Perl, but maybe less so compared to (some/many/) other languages
[22:30] <MasterDuke> e.g., Raku regexes are more verbose than Perl regexes
[22:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, regexes are pretty reader-friendly compared to most regex syntaxes (perhaps all I have seen)
[22:42] *** tejr left
[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but "magic variables" (I don't know if this is the right term, I mean $_ and $/ in particular) for example are rather tricky for someone not used to the Perl family
[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> again, that doesn't mean they are bad, the topic variable is a bit like good old Pascal `with` for me, it removes unnecessary repetition of a term
[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> for me it feels they are more for refactoring than easy readability
[22:44] *** tejr joined
[22:48] *** jjido left
[23:00] <MasterDuke> i wasn't around during the early parts of the language creation, but i wonder if timtoady has a slightly different sense of read the code than one might usually think. i.e., he's talked about being inspired by natural language constructs (e.g., postfix `if`, `unless`), maybe he is/was thinking of reading in a more general sense of understanding
[23:00] <MasterDuke> what's going on than knowing exactly how everything you read is implemented
[23:06] <MasterDuke> so one might look at `$/<good-name-here>` and not know exactly *how* the contents of `$/` are populated, but if that name is in fact descriptive, you have a good guess at what's going on. compared to a fictitious example `match_result.named_matches.get('good-name-here')`, there's just a lot more stuff obscuring what you actually care about
[23:06] <MasterDuke> but this is all just speculation on my part

[23:50] *** linkable6 joined
[23:59] <japhb> The list of magic variables is actually *much* reduced from Perl.  And that was intentional.
