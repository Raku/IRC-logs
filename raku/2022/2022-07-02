[13:20] <uzl[m]> "When a binding points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that value forever. The = operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one." 

[13:20] <uzl[m]> Reading this JavaScript book, and it seems they use "binding" differently to how it's used in Raku. It seems it's used interchangeably with assignment ü•≤

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Not surprising

[14:11] * guifa wonders if there could be a way to add a "when" trait

[14:12] <guifa> like `multi sub foo ($,$,$) when $*MODE == 'debug' {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}`

[14:12] *** gcd joined
[14:13] <guifa> I guess it could be done with `will run-when{$*MODE eq 'debug'}` and then wrapping the candidate to call the next candidate on fail

[14:29] <guifa> this is nice, except signatures are immutable even when andling traits =\

[14:29] <guifa> m: multi sub foo(:$ where $*MODE eq 'debug') { say "debug" }; multi sub foo { say "production" }; my $*MODE = 'debug'; foo; $*MODE = 'nodebug'; foo

[14:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6dc2f92c9: OUTPUT: ¬´debug‚ê§production‚ê§¬ª

[14:35] <gfldex> m: multi sub foo($a, $? where ($*MODE // '') eq 'debug') { say "$a with debug"; }; my $*MODE = 'debug'; foo(42);

[14:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6dc2f92c9: OUTPUT: ¬´42 with debug‚ê§¬ª

[14:36] <gfldex> you would need a RakuAST macro to turn that into a trait. Right now we can modify signatures at compile time.

[14:36] <gfldex> s/can/can't/

[14:36] <gfldex> unless you are willing to .wrap

[15:12] *** evalable6 left
[15:13] *** linkable6 joined
[15:14] *** evalable6 joined
[15:51] <guifa> Yeah, was hoping to avoid the .wrap

[15:52] <guifa> I was a bit surprised you can do an anonymous named argument but I guess that's Raku for you, strangely consistent

[15:57] <thowe> there's a predefined character class in the docs called <xdigit>, but I'm wondering if it is a mistake in the docs?  I found a rosetta code example that uses "hexdigit" and that seems to work where xdigit does not.

[15:59] <phogg> xdigit is a traditional POSIX character class

[16:01] <thowe> phogg: do you know how it differs from <hexdigit> ?

[16:01] <thowe> This rosetta code example uses <hexdigit> to do what it seems xdigit should do:  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parse_an_IP_Address#Raku

[16:02] <thowe> but attempting to use <xdigit> in place of <hexdigit> doesn't match what it should.  Also, <hexdigit> is undocumented as far as I can tell and it's got me scratching my head.

[16:02] *** sena_kun left
[16:04] *** sena_kun joined
[16:05] <thowe> hm, well maybe <xdigit> works and <:hexdigit> works.  the ":" might be the difference, not sure what it means

[16:05] <phogg> thowe: I am no authority on this. That said <:hexdigit> looks like a unicode property matcher to me. 

[16:06] <phogg> xdigit is 0-9A-Fa-f, so I imagine :hexdigit is at least those codepoints.

[16:07] <thowe> OK, I'll buy that.  But this code doesn't define it and it isn't in the docs as far as I can tell.

[16:07] <thowe> unless it is burried someplace the search function can't find it

[16:09] <phogg> I expect you have to read unicode docs.

[16:14] <guifa> :Foo selects a character based on a unicode property

[16:15] <phogg> thowe: It would be nice if https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%3C:property%3E listed every possible property, but even in that example it uses <:Block()> and <:Script()> but doesn't otherwise describe them.

[16:15] <phogg> it does link to the uniprop page, which in turn links ultimately back to https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings/properties.html

[16:15] <phogg> which does document Hex_Digit

[16:15] <guifa> Unicode's hex digits are <0123456789ABCDEFabcdefÔºêÔºëÔºíÔºìÔºîÔºïÔºñÔºóÔºòÔºôÔº°Ôº¢Ôº£Ôº§Ôº•Ôº¶ÔΩÅÔΩÇÔΩÉÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩÜ>

[16:15] <guifa> (those are fullwidth forms, no spaces)

[16:16] <phogg> no idea how you would know :hexdigit would work for that, but :Hex_DIgit seems to be the same

[16:16] <phogg> s/I/i/

[16:16] <guifa> phogg: I was actually just about to say that the underscore is what I would expect

[16:16] <guifa> maybe the underscore is just ignored for those

[16:16] <thowe> "hexdigit" also seems to not be in the Unicode docs...  What I'm trying to figure out is how would I ever know to use "hexdigit" if I hadn't seen it in this example?  I can't seem to draw that line

[16:16] <phogg> guifa: maybe Raku allows any s/_//g and ignores case?

[16:16] <guifa> phogg: jinx lol

[16:17] <phogg> seems it's something like that

[16:18] <phogg> e.g. ASCII_Hex_Digit works, as does asciihexdigit, and ASCII_Hex_Digit, but not ASCII_HexDigit, or even asciihexdigiT

[16:18] <thowe> <:Hex_Digit> does seem to work in the code, but I couldn't find it when googling "Unicode General Category name" I will look at the docs you posted

[16:19] <phogg> so the original case, strictly lower case, or either without the _ works for unicode proeprties

[16:19] <phogg> thowe: unicode docs are surprisingly hard to google for. Not well-linked, I expect.

[16:19] <phogg> the details are of interest only to a handful of implementers

[16:20] <guifa> Looks like the underscore variants are hard coded

[16:20] <phogg> guifa: found the code in the Raku implementation?

[16:20] <thowe> I wonder if a link from https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Unicode_properties  would be helpful

[16:20] <phogg> guifa: I would still expect that to be the result of a script.

[16:21] <phogg> thowe: I would say so, but there is a link on the uniprops page linked from there, so it's not too hard to find.

[16:21] <guifa> no, just testing around

[16:22] <thowe> phogg: that link honestly looked like an error to my eye.  I should have looked closer.

[16:24] <thowe> when I saw "class Cool" I thought I landed in the wrong place

[16:32] <thowe> well, that was fun.  Thanks for the help!
