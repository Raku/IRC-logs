[02:33] <[Coke]> ok, never seen this before: doing an install on a clean windows 10 box. install strawberry perl and git bash. in git bash, run perl Configure.pl..... get an error about a missing perl5 module, Locale/Maketext/Simple.pm

[02:36] <[Coke]> and the use is coming from /usr/share/perl5/core_perl/Params/Check.pm - bother.

[02:38] <[Coke]> oh, using the wrong perl.

[12:16] <tbrowder> lizmat: guifa: i solved my problem. i was getting misled by the error msg: my formatter had a typo but but the error msg said i couldn't use year month ... formatter and i thought my formatter has tested ok but i was wrong. i made some chg that finally triggered a problem with a specific line in a formatter and i saw the problem (missing comma after the sprintf "..."). fixed that and all looks well so far.

[12:17] <lizmat> *phew*  :-)

[14:13] <tonyo> Is any module publisher currently using windows without Linux subsystem?

[14:16] <lizmat> good question

[14:19] *** Sgeo joined
[14:19] <Voldenet> wsl or wsl2?

[14:30] <[Coke]> me?

[14:30] <El_Che> hi tonyo, what are you trying to do? Make a package manager? A module publisher?

[14:31] <[Coke]> I have no "big" modules, but anything I do on windows is with a raku that is built using Visual Studio (and then usually run in git bash)

[14:31] <[Coke]> (can also build one using just strawberry perl's toolkit + git bash)

[14:32] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/f6488d106d4a580216809f3e69b553f5 (strawberry/git bash install instructions from git)

[14:32] <[Coke]> Happy to test something on windows if you need.

[14:35] <El_Che> [Coke]: I am not bashing on Windows, but you are a couragous man

[14:35] <El_Che> :)

[14:36] <[Coke]> Eh - I have to use it for work, so it's nice to be able to use Raku for some of that.

[14:36] <El_Che> I was supposed to do that and tried really, really hard

[14:36] <El_Che> then one day I went pyscho and installed Linux :)

[14:37] <El_Che> it helped that I managed the network access :)

[14:37] <El_Che> (never mind, I have colleagues that are perfectly happy now with wsl and stuff, but it never cliked with me)

[14:38] <El_Che> I think I officially have a "test" linux and a "test" mac next to a old windows laptop somewhere.

[14:38] <Voldenet> I prefer msys2 over wsl

[14:39] <El_Che> They probably just sighed and went further with their lives :)

[14:39] <El_Che> googling

[14:39] <Voldenet> the problem is that apparently MS is not entirely sure what they need wsl for

[14:40] <El_Che> cygwin like but more modern?

[14:40] <Voldenet> the "linux vm pretending it's not vm" is the most hilarious one so far

[14:41] *** abraxxa left
[14:41] <Voldenet> the msys2 is something that ships with git for win currently

[14:41] <Voldenet> iirc

[14:41] <Voldenet> msys2 is fork of cygwin

[14:44] <El_Che> I see

[14:44] <El_Che> those were the days

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> cygwin comes with certain limitations that basically sabotage installing Rakudo

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> looking at you, open file limit

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I use WSL as "the cygwin that actually works"

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> integrates well with the windows filesystem, providing complete interoperability, I can use all the usual grep, sed, scp business from Windows

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also, it comes with a nice VSC plugin for "remote" development

[17:07] <El_Che> lizmat: what's the trouble with the alpine package? I had no trouble building there

[17:13] <ugexe> building rakudo or a module/distribution?

[17:13] <ugexe> because the later is what was broken

[17:14] <ugexe> and it didnt affect certain modules for whatever reason

[17:15] <drakonis> https://morepablo.com/2022/09/so-you-re-using-a-weird-language.html a raku mention here

[17:15] <drakonis> its been a while since i've last checked on raku, has rakuast gone anywhere?

[17:16] <drakonis> oh, that just came up on the minutes

[17:17] <El_Che> ugexe: I understood rakudo from liz' notes

[17:20] *** MoC left
[17:23] <ugexe> ah maybe. there was also recently a distribution precomp issue with alpine (and others) that was fixed last week

[17:24] <ugexe> i assumed it was that

[17:24] <El_Che> yeah, that's also liky
