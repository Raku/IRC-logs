[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > multi f(1 --> -1) {}

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if this is a syntax error but with `1 --> 1` it isn't, how am I supposed to mark a negative return value?

[09:54] *** lichtkind joined
[09:57] <lizmat> that's an interesting one

[09:57] <lizmat> it's purely a parsing issue

[09:58] <lizmat> m: my constant minusone = -1; sub a(--> minusone) { }; dd a

[09:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´-1‚ê§¬ª

[09:58] <lizmat> if there isn't an issue for it yet, one should be made I think

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, I used pretty much the same workaround üòÑ

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I will check on it but first I want to get the overall thing working

[10:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, another interesting unexpected phenomenon

[10:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> adding a type notation for a parameter messes up the dispatch order for multis

[10:23] <lizmat> ? example?

[10:30] *** neither left
[10:31] *** Geth left
[10:31] *** Geth joined
[10:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Hm, this has something to do with the type coercion as well...

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Okay, I still don't really know how dispatching for constant values happens

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's not really smartmatching because f('0') doesn't actually get dispatched to f(0)

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> https://gist.github.com/2colours/999dc5b37ed348dbbaa66d99430d6479 this works as intended

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if I change the third multi clause to `multi m√∂bius(Int() $n) {`, it takes priority at dispatching, hence breaks the outcome

[10:50] *** neither joined
[10:51] <MasterDuke> what if you put `is default` on the literal 1 multi?

[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> won't help

[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not when the input is 5 üòõ

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if the input is 1 then it works even without `is default`

[10:57] <lizmat> m: sub a(0) { dd }; a 0

[10:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´sub a(0)‚ê§¬ª

[10:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so yeah one could say the type notation takes priority over the value constraint

[10:57] <lizmat> m: sub a("0") { dd }; a 0

[10:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´Type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected Str but got Int (0)‚ê§  in sub a at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[10:58] <lizmat> m: say 0 eqv '0'

[10:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[10:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Seems like IntStr can be dispatched to an integer constant since that's what I'm doing

[11:00] <lizmat> m: say 0 ~~ <0>

[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[11:00] <lizmat> m: say <0> ~~ 0

[11:41] <tbrowder> howdy. anyone know of a raku existing or wip module to work with couchdb? there seem to be several perl modules on cpan which could be a good start.

[21:10] <Tirifto> \o

[21:12] <Tirifto> Is there a way one can exit a block which is not a routine? Something like ‚Äòreturn‚Äô but for blocks? I‚Äôd like to have a condition for exiting early, and I‚Äôd like to avoid putting the block‚Äôs contents in a nested ‚Äòif‚Äô statement (or similar).

[21:16] <lizmat> m: leave

[21:17] <lizmat> Tirifto ^^

[21:17] <lizmat> it was thought of to have a "leave" statement

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `when` can still help I guess?

[21:18] <lizmat> but nobody so far has really seen the need for it, as wrapping something in a sub and using return will give you the same

[21:20] <Tirifto> lizmat: Ah, right, I accidentally ran into that error few days ago, but wasn‚Äôt sure what the intended purpose was. I guess prefixing with ‚Äòsub‚Äô might be the cleaner solution then.

[21:21] <lizmat> indeed

[21:21] <guifa> m: my $a = 5; NOT-LOOP: {¬†last NOT-LOOP if $a < 10; say "nope" }; say "done"

[21:21] <guifa> meh, worth a shot

[21:22] <Tirifto> @Nemokosch#9980: ‚Äòwhen‚Äô doesn‚Äôt exit in statement modifier form though, so you still have to nest another block, right?

[21:26] <Tirifto> (Oh, actually it wouldn‚Äôt be the issue of the statement modifier but what might come before it. >_<)

[21:26] *** lichtkind_ joined
[21:29] <moon-child> well, you could say NOT-LOOP: for ^1 { ... }, giving effectively the same result

[21:29] *** lichtkind left
[21:29] <moon-child> and, following the abov,e you could say  NOT-LOOP: for ^$condition { ... }

[21:29] <moon-child> if $condition is false, the range will be empty and the loop will not be entered

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I didn't understand it

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> my example was complete in the sense that I tried to give exactly equivalent one-liners

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `when` causes the surrounding block to terminate if the condition is true. indeed it needs a block - but who said we have to put anything inside? üòâ

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> actually I'm almost sure I've used this "pattern" before

[22:04] <Tirifto> @Nemokosch#9980: Oh right, I could just invert the condition and use that! I guess a sub is more ‚Äòproper‚Äô, but this would be pretty elegant, too.

[22:04] <Tirifto> Thank you all for pointing at the butterfly! :D

[23:43] <atweiden_air--> is it possible to combine Signatures?

[23:54] <drakonis> i'm thinking about implementing a stack machine in raku

[23:55] <drakonis> it looks like it'd need TCO for that?

[23:58] <drakonis> signature combination?
