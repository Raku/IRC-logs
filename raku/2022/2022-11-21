[10:11] <notable6> Nemokosch, Noted! (weekly)

[10:11] <tellable6> 2022-11-19T11:26:11Z #raku <Woodi> Nemokosch: never considered Tcl a success....

[10:11] <tellable6> 2022-11-19T15:39:34Z #raku <El_Che> Nemokosch: like I said, pretty much everything. Docker, Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Kubernetes, Consul, etcd, etc :)

[10:11] <Nemokosch> huh :DD 

[10:12] <Nemokosch> anyway, quite a lame effort but I think it would be good to raise awareness that there is a place like this now

[10:13] <Nemokosch> and just like I advocated for the introduction of Github Discussions for Raku/doc, I think eventually this could be introduced for several Raku-related repos

[10:51] <El_Che> someone here runs arm64? almost finished with the rakudo arm64 packages

[10:52] <moritz> at times I find two arms challenging, imaging having to deal with 64! :-)

[10:52] <El_Che> need to do some esthetic changes in the filename in cirrus and upload to the repo, but what I have should be installable (with rpm/dpkg/etc)

[10:53] <El_Che> moritz: think of the additional raku books you could write

[10:54] <El_Che> packages are in in the pkg artifact folder for each distro build: https://cirrus-ci.com/build/6700332659507200

[10:55] <El_Che> for some reason, the OS version is not added to the name, making the upload not feasable until that sorted (for me, computers don't care)

[10:56] <El_Che> I hope this cirrus thing is a stop over until github actions supports arm64 natively

[11:20] <jast> I have an ARMv8-A machine that I could run tests on but I don't intend to actually use Raku on it :)

[11:23] <El_Che> jast: the test is checking of raku runs fine on your distro, the proper tests where done at build time :)

[11:24] <El_Che> jast: while arm64 rakudo does not have JIT (yet), it isn't that slow, maybe because arm got fast fast :)

[11:27] <jast> as always, to get software fast, rely on hardware improvements :)

[11:28] <jast> unfortunately this is a RasPi 4 so it's actually quite slow

[11:28] <El_Che> JIT would be extremely useful in a world where arm64 is more visible, but I don't think there are many people around that can do that type of specific work

[11:29] <jast> just use AI, from what people say on the internet it's the solution to all problems

[11:29] <El_Che> https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/operating-systems-blog/posts/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-a1-nginix?utm_source=oracle&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=2021_infrastructure-servers_mk03-2_na_na_na_awa&utm_content=blog

[11:30] <El_Che> I played with the oracle arm instances and while the show a low BogoMIPS (50.00) they feel faster than the x64 offerings

[11:30] <El_Che> it depends on the workload of course

[11:32] <jast> well bummer, the architecture for my system is armhf, not arm64

[11:32] <El_Che> rpi3?

[11:32] <jast> I think I just recycled the old install when I switched to the rpi4

[11:32] <El_Che> ah yes, 32 bit used to be the default

[11:33] <jast> that's the punishment for being lazy I suppose

[11:33] <El_Che> With debian proper releasing 64-bit builds, that is slowly changing

[11:34] <El_Che> if you're short of yaks, you know what to do :P

[11:34] <jast> I have plenty of yaks already :P

[11:35] <El_Che> that's pretty much the definition

[11:35] <El_Che> but are the yaks as shiny as the new ones?

[11:35] <jast> they're competing for shininess

[11:35] <jast> so it keeps changing

[16:21] <tonyo> riscv is the way

[16:36] <tbrowder> .ask leont i am getting a good test file results in a macos.yml run but it fails because prove6 reports it found a bad utf8 char. i cannot find any bad chars in my test files, and the linux run is good. i have looked at the '--trap' and '--err=ignore' options but haven't tried them yet. would '-err=ignore' be suitable for the utf8 problem? i will try that now...

[16:36] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to leont

[16:36] <leont> o/

[16:38] <leont> I don't think --trap is relevant to this, and probably --err isn't either

[17:28] <tbrowder> could it be a newline problem? doesn't mac use something different?

[20:24] <tbrowder> sounds like a plan

[20:28] <tbrowder> i've given up ever doing anything practical with it, but i would like to support users of it if practical. macos people i know (outside of here) think it's the only thing people use. my landlady sent the lease to me as a "pages" document and it was a real pain to figure out how to read it. i asked her to please create a pdf but she didn't know how.

[20:29] <tirnanog> qemu can also run it. it's not a very pleasant experience because the lack of video acceleration disproporationately affects that particular operating system. it did work, though.

[20:29] <lizmat> Pages has an "Export to PDF option"

[20:29] *** MoC left
[20:29] <tbrowder> my son is a macos user, but he sure spends a lot of money for it.

[20:31] <lizmat> that may be true, but if I see how much I spend on configuring my Mac, compared to people configuring Linux, I value my hours more  :-)

[20:34] <tbrowder> lizmat: i knew it would, and casually suggested it, but she didn't know about that. i think she was too involved with her daughter's upcoming wedding. i think chrome somehow magically transformed it to pdf upon download.

[20:35] <tbrowder> anyhow, probably a good point about config time.

[20:39] <tbrowder> a deb user list reply says there is a mac license issue about running mac on non-mac hardware

[20:39] <tbrowder> that sounds familiar

[20:39] <tbrowder> anyone know

[20:41] <tbrowder> of a mac vm provider like digitalocean for a reasonable price?

[20:42] <tbrowder> so far the ones i've found are very pricey

[20:46] *** ProperNoun left
[20:48] <avuserow> tbrowder: IIRC Apple also has some terms that make providing VM access fairly expensive (minimum 24 hour billing time or something)

[20:49] *** Kaiepi left
[20:50] <tonyo> there definitely is a clause in the agreement about running it non-mac hardware

[20:51] <tonyo> and, as avuserow, it's super expensive to run in a cloud (at least everywhere i've seen)

[20:51] <tbrowder> yes. amazon has some but i couldn't find any way to get anything less than $200+ per month

[20:51] *** Guest89 joined
[20:52] <tonyo> i haven't heard of mac going after any individual for running it though

[20:52] <avuserow> yeah, a month of AWS billing is like $450, which feels like "buy a used Mac Mini" level

[20:53] <tbrowder> catch 22 i guess

[20:53] <avuserow> I guess the cheap option is trial and error via github actions

[20:55] <El_Che> lizmat: I configured a linux, mac and windows laptop for work. Linux worked pretty much out of the box how I wanted besided adding some shell config. Mac took me a long week. Windows is still a work in progress :P

[20:55] <tonyo> craigslist is a good source for old apple hardware

[20:55] <El_Che> is it?

[20:55] <tonyo> yea

[20:55] <tbrowder> since mac users have so much more time, maybe they could sell time with their own testing VMs

[20:55] <El_Che> now with m1 and m2? you'll be gettting intels

[20:56] <tonyo> tbrowder: i can make a vm available to you when i'm home next

[20:56] <tonyo> about 1.5 weeks

[20:56] <tbrowder> sure

[20:56] <tonyo> no promises on up time as i live in the woods and both internet/power can be spotted

[20:58] <tonyo> three under $600

[21:00] <El_Che> craglist, woods? USA?

[21:01] <tbrowder> yes, but does their old OS versions support newer versions of packages? the 12-year-old mini i tried couldn't run much 

[21:02] <tbrowder> my son sold it for  $50

[21:02] <tbrowder> cost $400 originally

[21:03] <avuserow> The M1 ones are current. They're running the ARM processor so they should be good for a while.

[21:03] <tirnanog> nothing with "m1" among the specs can be particularly old.

[21:03] <tirnanog> they would all be able to run Ventura.

[21:06] <avuserow> Looks like Macbooks from 2017 or newer can run the latest MacOS
