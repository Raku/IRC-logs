[16:24] <tellable6> 2022-05-17T14:48:26Z #raku-dev <vrurg> bartolin Do you know why do I get 'java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: field_1' when use nqp::atomicbindattr/nqp::casattr and even just nqp::cas in the core?

[16:25] <bartolin_> oh, looks like I haven't been here for a while

[16:29] *** jgaz left
[16:30] <bartolin_> vrurg: pretty sure you figured that out. As far as I remember, the atomic ints have only been stubbed for the jvm backend. But I think there was a recent branch/PR in that area. (yes, I found this: https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/776)

[16:34] <bartolin_> vrurg: btw, do you maybe have a quick idea what could cause https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5037? I don't fully understand https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/71de22321d and have no idea how it changes multi dispatch for the JVM backend. (If that's really the problem at hand.)

[17:21] <lizmat> TIL the meaning of the word rout

[17:29] <tbrowder> to all mi6 users: be aware that mi6 will overwrite an existing README.md by default if you accidentally run "mi6 test" or "mi6 build" in a non-mi6-managed module repo directory.

[17:32] *** razetime left
[17:32] <tbrowder> also, mi6 by default doesn't have to have a dist.ini file in a module base directory, but it uses the "[ReadmeFromPod] enable = true" as its default.

[17:34] *** Sgeo joined
[17:35] <lizmat> hmmm.. if there is no dist.ini, I guess that should be false as a default

[17:35] <lizmat> skaji ^^ ?

[17:38] <tbrowder> i just filed an issue on that

[17:41] <tbrowder> skaji says he doesn't want to require a dist.ini for mi6 to operate, but i don't know his rationale. maybe he will change the default action as enable=false but that is not guaranteed.

[17:42] <tbrowder> he is steadfast in his design approach for mi6

[17:43] <lizmat> and that's ok  :-)    but the current default on an absent dist.ini is just too dangerous I think

[17:43] <tbrowder> i agree

[17:46] <tbrowder> i am revisiting my mi6 helper module to be (1) functional and (2) more benign to help ease conversion of existing modules, and enable=false is right there as default unless the user wants something else.

[17:46] <tbrowder> the other main default will be to use zef/fez

[21:49] <orylesor> Hey! I'm Teresa. (she/her)

[21:49] <orylesor> I've installed Linenoise with zef on Arch Linux to gain tab completion in the rakudo REPL. I hoped it would complete partially typed variable names, but it seemingly can't do that. Can you make Linenoise do it? If not, is there a trick or another library that can do it?

[21:49] <orylesor> Thanks in advance.

[21:57] *** lichtkind left
[22:14] <Voldenet> while theoretically possible (you can get variables from :: and linenoiseSetCompletionCallback it's implementable), but I'm not sure if it was implemented

[22:14] <Voldenet> s/,but//

[22:24] <Voldenet> So, apparently https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/1c0436/src/core.c/REPL.pm6#L143

[22:27] <orylesor> Unfortunately I'm not only a Raku beginner, but I'm an absolute beginner in programming so I can't yet make anything of that, but I appreciate you pointed me in the right direction(?)

[22:29] <Voldenet> So… the line there seems like a list of completions

[22:31] <Voldenet> and it only includes functions in CORE:: so it will help you completing things like "categorize", "await" but not variable names

[22:31] <Voldenet> (unless I'm wrong)

[22:33] <orylesor> That's exactly what it does! Oh, so you confirmed that's how it is by looking at the source code. Nice, thanks for confirming!

[22:36] *** sena_kun left
[22:50] *** jgaz left
[23:06] <tbrowder> orylesor: welcome! are you aware of the beginner channel #raku-beginner? you may get responses a bit sooner there, but this channel is pretty friendly and usually helpful

[23:26] <orylesor> tbrowder: Yes, saw it in this channel's header message thing. I just figured the REPL question isn't a typical beginner question.

[23:26] <orylesor> Thank you. :)
