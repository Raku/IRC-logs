[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Should I expect any (significant) "performance penalties" from using `sym<>`  regexes or rules? I plan to do my own experiments, but any related observations or knowledge from others would help...

[14:18] *** razetime left
[14:18] <lizmat> if there are any penalties, it's in compile time

[14:19] <[Coke]> going to try to write something with ansi terminal sequences for my utility script need. I basically want something I can plug Terminal::Spinners into to get the status update line on the bottom of the screen, and have all output emitted from the script scroll in the area above. Would anyone else find this sort of thing useful?

[14:19] <lizmat> probably :-)

[14:20] <[Coke]> I think I'd take over the whole window. Ideally if I knew I was in a pipe, I'd ignore all of this and just pass through the output.

[14:22] *** hethw_ joined
[14:24] *** hethw left
[14:26] <japhb> [Coke]: Yeah, and I'm curious to see exactly what sequences you use.  (Most of the ones I use are the ones needed for Terminal::Print or Terminal::LineEditor.)

[14:34] *** hethw_ left
[14:35] <[Coke]> ah, nifty, thanks.

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Thank you! (And it makes sense.)

[14:36] <[Coke]> the literal "AUTHOR" text here https://raku.land/zef:japhb/Terminal::LineEditor is vertical.

[14:37] <lizmat> so don't do that in scripts  :-)

[14:39] <[Coke]> ah. Terminal::Print is not portable, is it.

[14:39] <[Coke]> (relies on termios)

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @Coke I want to use Raku for making chat-bots through CLI scripts, so the functionalities you mention would help ...

[14:41] <japhb> [Coke]: Yeah ... I mean, I assume it probably works under WSL2, but I've never tried.

[14:42] <japhb> As for the AUTHOR text on raku.land, I have *no idea* why it is doing that.

[14:44] <lizmat> japhb: that's a known issue in the renderer

[14:52] <aru> Hi, I'm messing around with grammars. Could anyone give me a hint why in this example https://p.teknik.io/T3FeL this works, but if I use the other definition for words, I get nil for all the examples? From what I gathered both definitions should be equivalent

[15:00] <aru> ahh, silly me

[15:05] *** jjido left
[15:05] <aru> but I'm still failing to use a newline as a delimiter

[15:06] *** razetime left
[15:29] <moritz> aru: 'rule' implies automatic matching of whitspace. Newline is also whitespace, so it'll be used up automatically

[15:29] <moritz> you could do something like   token ws { \h+ }

[15:29] <aru> right, I made it work in the meantime, without fully understanding what's going on

[15:29] <moritz> \h matches only horizontal whitepsace

[15:29] *** Altai-man left
[15:30] *** Altai-man joined
[15:30] <moritz> (and 'ws' is what 'rule` use to parse whitespace)

[15:35] *** Xliff joined
[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oh, the legendary moritz...

[15:35] <Xliff> Talk about interesting...

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> perhaps you know whether left recursion in grammars can be dealt with in Raku grammars?

[15:36] <Xliff> Can someone post some links on educational resources for Raku? 

[15:36] *** qorg11 joined
[15:36] <Xliff> An educational opportunity has rolled up on my desk. I'd like to submit a lesson plan centered around Raku. I then might be offered the opportunity to teach the class.

[15:39] <moritz> Nomokosch: no left recursion in grammars, no

[15:39] <moritz> Xliff: https://perl6book.com/ has lots of resources, for one

[15:40] <Xliff> Wasn't there a lesson plan for Raku?

[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> tldr it seems like the grammar of Rust has left recursion in it and someone tried to parse it not so long ago

[15:40] <moritz> https://andrewshitov.com/2021/01/13/the-course-of-raku/

[15:41] <Xliff> moritz++

[15:41] <moritz> I don't think left-recursion is part of a language, just of a grammar. You can always come up with a grammar for the same language that's not left recursive

[15:41] *** razetime joined
[15:41] <moritz> in fact, there are parser generators that do that automatically (possibly bison?)

[15:42] <moritz> ("always" is to be used with caution here; I think the theoretical proof applies to context-free grammars)

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the question is, at what cost?

[15:47] <moritz> with a bit of experience it's usually not too bad

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > for example, we descend from <expression> into <expression-without-block>, into <operator-expression>,  into <comparison-expression>, but then back up into <expression>

[15:50] <moritz> there are lots of examples out there on how to structure an expression grammar that it doesn't run into left recursion

[15:51] * [Coke] wonders when moritz got famous. :)

[15:51] <[Coke]> also: hey, dude.

[15:52] <moritz> [Coke]: i wondered that as well :-) Hi there

[15:54] <moritz> In fact I'm pretty sure that both the parsing book and my general raku book contain examples for mathemtical expressions that avoid this left recursion pitfall

[15:55] *** Xliff left
[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well it's not my problem, thank God, so I'm perfectly satisfied with knowing that there are established solutions üòõ

[17:17] <rir> Fiveish thinking:  [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep( .elems >= 2);   How do I make a smartmatch work?  Or am I missing a callable?

[17:23] <CIAvash> rir: `.grep(*.elems >= 2)` or `.grep({ .elems >= 2 })` or `.grep: * ‚â• 2`

[17:26] *** razetime left
[17:39] <rir> CIAvash, thanks for setting right.   I was surprised then followed the no 'Bool as Matcher' in the wrong direction.

[17:46] <lizmat> most newbies initially think of "*.elems" as some magic, without realizing it is actually just syntax to create a Callable

[17:49] <tonyo> m: [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep({@$_ >= 2})

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: ( no output )

[17:49] <tonyo> m:  dd [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep({@$_ >= 2})

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: OUTPUT: ¬´($(1, 2),).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[17:49] <tonyo> star also just works

[17:49] <tonyo> m: dd [ (), (0), (1,2) ].grep(* >= 2);

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 377564339: OUTPUT: ¬´($(1, 2),).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this reminds me...

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is the difference between .cache and .List?

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> more specifically... it seems to me that .cache doesn't fetch the whole list
