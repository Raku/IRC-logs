[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa and @Coke Mostly aggregation statistics like this one: https://i.imgur.com/6KSaaSD.png
[00:27] <ToddAndMargo> Anyone on the 'NativeCall question:¬† how do I declare a "const void *src"' question?
[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Another type of statistics are time series related ones. (E.g. people with similar posting patterns -- maybe they talk to each other often...)
[00:29] <guifa> Anton: I think the former for sure is fine with real user names.  One thing you might do for the latter is obfuscate, but find a pair that demonstrates the pattern and see if they'd be okay with their names used in that context (I'd for one be okay with that).  Then you make it a reveal at the end of the article to confirm that they do indeed talk to each other often :-)
[00:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Of course, also, linguistic based statistics -- that requires removing the names. But certain themes associate more closely with certain people, etc...
[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa I might go in full "reproducible research"mode -- obfuscation in the article and scripts with to do the statistics with or without obfuscation. Basically, I need only a few real names / handles in order to provide some "visual calibration" while looking at the stats. (Something you say I should do at the end.)
[00:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I guess, for each "often enough" posting individual a script that produces statistics similar to the ones in this link can be made (without publishing the results): https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/text-analysis-of-trump-tweets/

[01:40] <ToddAndMargo> Another Native call question:¬† this declaration: "[out] ppSessionInfo", "A pointer to an array of WTS_SESSION_INFO structures that represent the retrieved sessions. To free the returned buffer, call the WTSFreeMemory function."¬† If I declare "ppSessionInfo" as a pointer, I get back nothing.¬† If I declare it as a unit, I get a bizarre number back
[01:40] <ToddAndMargo> that does not point to anything.¬† And the function's return value for both instance tells me it passed and that I have two structures,¬† What is the proper declaration for ppSessionInfo?

[11:50] <tbrowder> CIAvash: that was quick! how does ii handle automatic publishing at a scheduled  time? theming? comments? (jmerelo will insist on those three features as a minimum). he also wants the same stats as provided by WO, so i‚Äôm sure one our peeps like <Anton Antonov> can take care of that.
[11:57] <CIAvash> tbrowder: The date of the articles is specified in the front matter of the article and when github actions builds the website every day it won't publish the articles whose dates are set in the future. Added comments. Its theme is right now the one I made for the raku-lang.ir/en website, but Hugo has support for themes if one wants that. I personally don't like to add analytics and things like that, but I'm sure there are options.

[13:13] <CIAvash> no problem, it may not even be used; speaking from personal experience üòÄ
[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you mean the site? üòÖ

[13:17] <CIAvash> Iranian/Persian
[13:18] <El_Che> CIAvash: ok, you win the classical historical culture award :)
[13:19] <El_Che> CIAvash: cradle of civilization flex and all :)
[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the homeland of wrestlers
[13:20] <CIAvash> Wow, thanks, I don't remember the last time I got an award üòÄ

[13:33] <El_Che> rakunista, rakushka, rakunillo, etc etc
[13:33] <El_Che> :)
[13:34] <tbrowder> i like rakuun
[13:35] <El_Che> you will need to write that in IPA

[13:45] <tbrowder> <Anton Antonov> you should be able to rename it still if you want to
[13:45] <El_Che> Is it Esperanto 2.0
[13:45] <El_Che> ?

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> The current title of the advent article is "Eat your own Raccoons (with IRC grilling)". I might have to replace the grammatically correct "Raccoons" with a community hinting name, like, "Rakoons."

[23:49] <atweiden-air_> comparing raku map and deepmap to (my most rudimentary understanding of) C# LINQ select and select many...
[23:49] <atweiden-air_> map appears to do the same as LINQ select many, that is, it applies the mapping function to each element of the operand/input, recursing into any iterable elements found:
[23:49] <atweiden-air_> m: my @a = [qw<a b c>, qw<d e f>], [qw<g h i>, qw<j k l>,], [qw<m n o>, qw<p q r>]; @a.map(*.uc);
[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6cded78e9: ( no output )
[23:50] <atweiden-air_> m: my @a = [qw<a b c>, qw<d e f>], [qw<g h i>, qw<j k l>,], [qw<m n o>, qw<p q r>]; @a.map(*.uc).say;
[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6cded78e9: OUTPUT: ¬´(A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R)‚ê§¬ª
[23:50] <atweiden-air_> why does map do this? just to understand the reasoning behind it
[23:58] <leont> m: my @a = [qw<a b c>, qw<d e f>], [qw<g h i>, qw<j k l>,], [qw<m n o>, qw<p q r>]; dd @a.map(*.uc);
[23:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6cded78e9: OUTPUT: ¬´("A B C D E F", "G H I J K L", "M N O P Q R").Seq‚ê§¬ª
[23:59] <leont> It doesn't recurse, but it stringifies the lists
