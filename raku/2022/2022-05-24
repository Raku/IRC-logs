[11:33] <kueppo> HI everyone, I'm new to Raku, I was wondering if there's any roadmap on how to read the Raku doc because whenever I decide to read a section of it, the examples they use uses many unknown features and at sometimes I'm kinda stuck.

[11:34] <kueppo> sorry for the stupid question.

[11:39] <lizmat> kueppo: that's not a stupid question

[11:40] <lizmat> is there a particular language you're coming from ?

[11:41] <kueppo> from perl, I've been using perl for 1 years now

[11:41] <lizmat> perhaps this can be helpful then: https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell

[11:41] <kueppo> but they are a lot of new features in raku that are somehow confusing

[11:42] <kueppo> thanks for the links

[11:42] <lizmat> probably from https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell#Syntax onwards

[11:44] <kueppo> question

[11:44] <kueppo> I would like to learn the basics of this val:key<value> I'm seeing them on variables, subroutines, class, literals, operators  etc and they are all confusing.

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is this?

[11:45] <kueppo> val:key<value>, they called it pair literals and they sometimes appear in complex identifier.

[11:46] <kueppo> and even on objects

[11:46] <kueppo> like this Mu:D

[11:47] *** jjido joined
[11:47] <lizmat> well, everybody wants the colon  :-)

[11:48] *** abraxxa left
[11:48] <kueppo> yeah, X)

[11:51] <lizmat> in the context of Mu:D, the :D indicates a "must be defined" constraint on the type (Mu), and is sometimes also called a "type smiley"  

[11:52] <lizmat> other type smileys are :U  (for must *not* be defined, or "undefined") and :_ (don't care, which is when you want to be explicit about not caring)

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the type smiley is cute

[11:52] <lizmat> foo<bar> is basically sugar coating for foo => "bar"

[11:52] <kueppo> got it, thanks alot :)  lizmat

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I get :key<value> but what is that "val" in front of it?

[11:54] <lizmat> oops, :foo<bar> of course  :-)

[11:54] <kueppo> that was a mistake, I was confusing :key<value> with complex identifiers.

[11:54] <lizmat> well, you can haz it as an identifier

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the colon pairs

[11:54] <lizmat> e.g. infix ops are just subroutines with funny names:

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> infix:<+>

[11:55] <lizmat> the "+" in "42 + 666" is just a sub called "infix:<+>"

[11:55] <lizmat> m: say infix:<+>(42,66)     # same as 42 + 666

[11:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 19c3bd180: OUTPUT: «108␤»

[11:55] <lizmat> m: say infix:<+>(42,66)     # same as 42 + 66

[11:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 19c3bd180: OUTPUT: «108␤»

[11:56] <kueppo> now I see  :O

[11:56] *** Nemokosch joined
[11:56] <Nemokosch> m: dd &infix:<+>.WHAT

[11:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 19c3bd180: OUTPUT: «Sub+{is-pure}+{Precedence}␤»

[11:57] <lizmat> the "is pure" is a hint for the optimizer, that the return value of any combination of arguments, is always the same

[11:57] <lizmat> aka 1 + 1 is *always* 2

[11:57] <kueppo> another question: the fact that everybody wants the colon is somehow confusing so I would like to get the underlying concept behind this colon thing.

[11:58] <lizmat> the Precedence part is the precedence level that the operator has during parsing

[11:58] <Nemokosch> is pure was new for me

[11:58] <lizmat> kueppo: perhaps https://github.com/Raku/CCR/blob/main/Remaster/Zoffix%20Znet/Raku-Colonpairoscopy.md is a good read

[11:59] <kueppo> thanks again lizmat

[12:00] <lizmat> I think there was also an advent post with more about the colon

[12:01] <Nemokosch> oh yeah, it can be used for named function parameters as well

[12:02] <Nemokosch> "can be" or this is the one way named function parameters are defined?

[12:02] <Nemokosch> because I only know the one with the colon

[12:02] <lizmat> well, the other is the fat arrow syntax

[12:02] <lizmat> foo => 42

[12:03] <Nemokosch> yes, when passing the argument

[12:03] <Nemokosch> but what about at the definition?

[12:03] *** Nemokosch left
[12:04] <lizmat> ah, you mean as a parameter?   then the colon syntax is the only one, yes

[12:06] *** reportable6 left
[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> sub foo($positonal-arg, :$named-arg) {}

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> sth like this

[12:09] <lizmat> yeah, the :$foo syntax is the only way that I know of  :-)

[12:09] *** reportable6 joined
[12:09] <lizmat> apart from somehow building a Signature object yourself and that somehow using that, but that gets into AST / RakuAST territory

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> gotcha
