[01:02] <jaguart> is there sugar for returning an empty sequence?

[01:03] <jaguart> I'm looking for something like: $thing.?x or (,)

[01:05] <jaguart> where $thing.?x returns Nil on failure - and I'm getting (Nil,)

[01:05] <tellable6> 2022-12-19T16:13:35Z #raku <grondilu> melezhik yeah it's think now.  In the meantime I uploaded the FiniteFields repo on zef, so this may have change things

[01:06] <melezhik> .tell bduggan: SparrowCI allows to builds for source hut as well, so you can create a pipeline for Repl::Tools and trigger builds for it ..

[01:06] <tellable6> melezhik, I haven't seen bduggan around, did you mean abdan?

[11:43] * guifa has had to do that in exactly one module

[11:43] <guifa> but it sort of makes sense when I'm rewriting DateTime lol

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> clever solution

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but anyway, it is kind of a "you shouldn't want this in the first place" thing

[11:52] <gfldex> Since type-objects are lexically scoped, there may be a 3rd Any involved and then this will fail.

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> By the way, I started processing the Template6 module, did some refactoring, caught a bug or two

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's an interesting journey in some sense because it mostly seems to be older than GLR

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And the author was clearly more used to Perl5 so in some cases I just blew boilerplate-ish chunks away

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the other interesting thing is that it generates code for templating and EVALs it so I suppose it could also be a great entry to RakuAST

[12:00] *** reportable6 left

[17:10] <[Coke]> any .NET developers about?

[17:40] <lizmat> jnthn is on holiday  :-)

[17:41] <Voldenet> I'm a .net dev

[17:41] <Voldenet> (not proud of it, but it gives me food)

[17:42] <[Coke]> wondering if I should try to get started again on nqp.net (I stare at for hours every couple of months and then get nowhere)

[17:42] <[Coke]> I may ping you. :)

[17:47] <Voldenet> I was about to say how trivial would it be to use nqp/jvm but then I've seen Ops.java

[17:53] <[Coke]> ... hey, there's a newer version out since last I looked.

[17:57] <Voldenet> Yes, net7 fixes a lot of pain points

[17:57] * [Coke] installs dotnet v7 on his mac

[17:58] <Voldenet> like static virtual methods in interfaces

[17:58] <[Coke]> step 0! Done!

[17:59] <Voldenet> I wonder how much aot compiler can speed raku startup up
