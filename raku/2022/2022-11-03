[11:26] <razetime> quassel doesn't handle unicode too well. that output looks strange

[11:31] <Voldenet> you've probably used bad charset, use utf8

[11:32] <Voldenet> (technically every person on irc can use different charset and it's legal)

[11:33] <razetime> it is displaying the utf 8 chars right, but it's the wrong line height.

[11:33] <razetime> so half of it is chopped

[12:13] <tbrowder> El_Che: i just looked at the wordpress site again and it says they support markdown--i must be losing my mind for sure.

[12:18] <tbrowder> but our own site would still be better imho

[12:18] <tbrowder> so the offer still stands

[12:20] <Nemokosch> what is "the wordpress site" in this context?

[12:22] <tbrowder> we host the Raku Advent (raku-advent.blog) on Wordpress, so we have to use their interface to get our articles on there to be published.

[12:25] <tbrowder> for myself, every visit to their user interface is a challenge

[12:26] <lizmat> Didn't zoffix write a module to convert markdown to HTML for the advent posts /

[12:26] <lizmat> ?

[12:26] <Nemokosch> Well, as long as "we" manage the Wordpress site, I don't see this as an issue

[12:27] <Nemokosch> I cannot fully feel the relevance of this. Do we have technical issues with the calendar?

[12:27] <tbrowder> yes, but after html gets on the site, and i need an edit, i usually strip all out and have to reinsert.

[12:28] <tbrowder> have you ever used it?

[12:30] <lizmat> I use it every week for the Weekly  :-)

[12:30] <lizmat> but for dev.to I'm quite happy to just write markdown  :-)

[12:30] <tbrowder> if so, tell me you love it. their WYSWIG editor does not give consistent views on my Windows and Linux boxes.

[12:31] <tbrowder> lizmat, i know. the weekly looks good, and you have fine-tuned your stles and themes over the years.

[12:31] <lizmat> actually, I haven't much  

[12:32] <Nemokosch> I know, "volunteer work is non-fungible"

[12:32] <razetime> dev.to has so much seo spam, i never thought there'd be raku posts on there

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat I use pandoc to convert Markdown to HTML for my posts.

[12:33] <lizmat> razetime: well, there'll be a whole lot more, at least for the rest of 2022

[12:33] <Nemokosch> But as somebody who keeps reporting language problems, tries to work with docs and in general get a top view of Raku community processes

[12:33] <razetime> i see

[12:33] <lizmat> I have an enormous backlog of subjects I want to blog about  :-)

[12:34] <tbrowder> ok, i usually rant about wordpress this time every year. nudf said.

[12:34] <razetime> i just hate that site so much.. all i get is heaps of unfiltered js and i don't even follow javascript

[12:34] <Nemokosch> I do feel that this sudden obsession (is this word fine?) with the calendar steals attention from things I think are way more important

[12:34] <lizmat> razetime: and I'll probably be recycling some CCR posts

[12:34] <razetime> CCR?

[12:34] <Nemokosch> Collect-Conserve-Remaster project

[12:34] <lizmat> https://github.com/raku/CCR#the-raku-collect-conserve-and-remaster-project

[12:35] <Nemokosch> ... another thing that I think is way more important than the calendar infrastructure :P

[12:35] <lizmat> Nemokosch: agree

[12:35] <razetime> hm. what is the raku.rocks domain for?

[12:36] <lizmat> razetime: that's a domain I mostly registered to be able to have a cool email address  :-)

[12:36] <lizmat> It might evolve into something else, dunno yet

[12:36] <razetime> i agree it is a cool email address (i want one!)

[12:37] <lizmat> hmmmm....

[12:37] <tbrowder> well the advent blogs are a part of the CCR project i assume, so they are more than insignificant.

[12:38] <lizmat> actually, nobody has bothered to import them into CCR yet, afaik  :-(

[12:38] <razetime> ah didn't know moonchild was part of the ccr project

[12:39] <lizmat> well, they had a PR and I merged it  :-)

[12:39] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/CCR/commits/main

[12:40] <Nemokosch> so moonchild is a person?

[12:40] <Nemokosch> sorry for my ignorance lol

[14:23] *** Nemokosch left
[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> To be honest, it makes me feel uncomfortable that raku.land is managed with GitLab. I mean, not the sole fact but it does discourage me from contributing

[14:29] <perryprog> WHy?

[14:29] <perryprog> Why?*

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> For practical reasons. Pretty much everything is on Github, that's what I'm used to, that's where I find all the content. I don't feel like starting with GitLab just for the sake of it

[14:33] <perryprog> o.0

[14:33] <perryprog> why would that make you feel uncomfortable though

[14:33] <perryprog> doesn't that just mean that you specifically would rather it be on GitHub so you don't need to make an account on GitLab?

[14:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I said it discourages me from contributing

[14:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Which I think can apply to several other people as well but that's obviously just a guess

[14:35] <perryprog> "it makes me feel uncomfortable that raku.land is managed with GitLab"

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I clarified it though?

[14:36] <perryprog> Huh?

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > I mean, not the sole fact but it does discourage me from contributing

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Anyway, couldn't we ask the other way around - why is it on GitLab (unlike 95% of Raku-related content) in the first place?

[14:38] <perryprog> Very confused here. You stated that, in some part, you're uncomfortable that raku.land is hosted on GitLab. Now you're saying you only said it discourages you from GitLab [because you don't want to make an account because... you don't want to?]

[14:39] <ugexe> you can login to gitlab with github if i remember correctly

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> No, I'm not saying it "now", I said this originally as well

[14:39] <ugexe> but yeah if you want your open source contributions to be seen by e.g. potential employers its probably best if they are all on the same platform 

[14:41] <perryprog> I'd get it if you had some reason that you felt GitLab was contrary to Raku's principles or something, but there's plenty of reasons it might not be hosted on GitHub that have significantly more weight than "centralization good" (yes, I realize that's not what you said). 

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, I can see that one can log in with Github as well, and I can see that all the issues were opened by Raku "regulars" who basically didn't use GitLab for anything else

[14:43] <perryprog> And anyway, raku.land isn't an "official" raku project, right? So it's the creator's discretion that they can do whatever they want with how they host it. If they want to put it up on an ftp server and only accept PRs through faxed in patches that were preapproved via 3 (three) people stamping a snail-mailed copy, then sure, whatever.

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perryprog: I'm the contrary - interested in the practical reasons while not having anything on the technology itself. (It's not Apple or something)

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for that matter, raku.land is close to become an "official" raku project

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Also, I expressed my personal feelings and you are denying them with hypotheticals. What is this good for?

[14:46] <perryprog> I am not denying your feelings.

[14:46] <perryprog> And if I did, I'm sorry—that wasn't my intent, and I should've expressed myself better.

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I didn't even say what should or shouldn't be, I only said that for me personally it's off-putting whenever I think of the very same thing I'd like to see imroved and could engage in, that for this sole project, I need to move away from the familiar Github macroverse

[14:48] <perryprog> Right, and that's okay—I'm just saying that there's nothing inherently "incorrect" with the way raku.land is being hosted, and it's possible its creator has similar but contrary feelings about GitHub.

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And whenever this happens, I'm also wondering if it discourages others as well. Especially considering the plans that raku.land should in fact replace the old modules site, it's noticeable that it doesn't have a lot of contributions, if I only compare it to the to-be docs site, for example

[14:56] * CIAvash would like raku.land to be on Codeberg!

[14:56] *** derpydoo joined
[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Of course this "polemy" of GH vs GL isn't the most important aspect overall but I think the current situation with "ownership" is problematic

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Like, it has already been expressed that raku.land could become the "new modules site" and the creators seemed to feel honored by this idea

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> At the same time, what will this mean on the management level? Do they keep the maintenance? It's awkward either way.

[14:59] <[Coke]> This sort of distributed ownership has been common in the OSS groups I've seen that don't have a corporate sponsor.

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It doesn't seem nice to say "okay, this is ours now, you turn into a mere user"

[15:00] <[Coke]> Did anyone say that, though?

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> However, I also don't think it would be beneficial to turn something official-ish into a user project.

[15:01] *** Nemokosch joined
[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Like, I could pick up modules.raku.org tomorrow, and supposedly it would be managed, because it formally belongs to the collective

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> considering previous situations where Raku (Perl6) got abandoned by very influential users, I think it would be unsafe to give up on an officially governed modules site

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> Important and interesting points (you bring / make.) I personally prefer GitHub, but it is owned by Microsoft, so, I try to put my most important repositories _also_  elsewhere.

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean I'm not a fanatic of Github, makes sense. Also GitLab has my respect for not calling merge requests "pull requests" haha. But I am used to Github and I accept it as the status quo

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> To finish the previous thought: when JJ stepped down as orchestrator of documentation content, he left stuff behind that could _theoretically_ be continued any day.

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm afraid if we "outsource" official stuff to volunteers - in the sense that they develop-host-own the whole thing - be it raku.land or anything else, that's a vulnerability, because if _they_ step down, there will be little chance to continue their work.

[15:16] <[Coke]> That's part of the risk without a centralized "owner", sure. But we've done quite well for years without it, and the RSC in the past few is good for identifying/managing that kind of risk, I think.

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I think that happens to most open source projects -- project implementation details and/or maintenance and/or documentation which are at the tail of the Pareto principle (and "take "80%" of time") make the creators step down. I would say that is inherent to the open source business model.

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> [Coke]: Of course the main problem is still the lack of people actually doing things but I can't fully agree with you

[15:19] <razetime> very sad that i can't use ⍺ and ⍵ in my identifier names :(

[15:20] <perryprog> wait, you can't?!

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> From what I can see when browsing Raku-related content, the situation is still somewhat worse than, say, in early 2019

[15:20] <perryprog> wow you can't. I always assumed we had unicode identifiers.

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> supposedly we do...

[15:21] <perryprog> m: my $foo⍺foo = 123;

[15:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar fa2f35e4e: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Bogus postfix␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my $foo⏏⍺foo = 123;␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤        infix␤        infix stopper␤        postfix␤        statement end␤     …»

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> maybe it's not "alfanumeric" for some reason

[15:28] <Nemokosch> perryprog: are you using REPL, and if so, which module?

[15:29] <perryprog> looking but I'm probably out of date

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> (I went to IRC for lower latency)

[15:29] <perryprog> Terminal::LineEditor

[15:30] <perryprog> v0.0.11

[15:30] <Nemokosch> then this might be a familiar thing. I had similar issues before with certain alt combos

[15:31] <Nemokosch> https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/issues/3

[15:32] <perryprog> aha!

[15:32] <perryprog> yeah, that update fixed it :)

[15:34] <Nemokosch> nice 8-)

[15:39] <Nemokosch> so my takeaway from the current position we are in is that we do need "managers". Not in the sense of people who command others to work, more like, people who bear responsibility for certain subprojects

[15:45] <Nemokosch> I can't foresee this change (and honestly, I wouldn't support it myself)

[15:46] <perryprog> Why not?

[15:46] <Nemokosch> iirc the rule is as simple as alfanumeric + apostrophe + dashes

[15:46] <razetime> yeah i guess it's a unicode 'property' lookup?

[15:46] <Nemokosch> I'm not sure anyone would want to break this

[15:46] <Nemokosch> yes

[15:47] <razetime> maybe it can be Slanged into existence

[15:47] <Nemokosch> non-alfanumeric can still be an operator

[15:48] <perryprog> I mean, Julia lets you use ⍺ as an identifier

[15:48] <Nemokosch> Raku lets you use α as an identifier

[15:49] <perryprog> I mean the APL alpha

[15:49] <perryprog> did I use the wrong oen

[15:49] <perryprog> one*

[15:49] *** Marcool04 joined
[15:49] <Nemokosch> I don't know but why wouldn't the Greek alpha just do?

[15:49] <perryprog> I dunno, 'cause it's what razetime did?

[15:49] *** jjido joined
[15:50] <Nemokosch> Okay but now razetime also knows that they could use the Greek alpha

[15:50] <razetime> julia again doesn't use the APL ⍺

[15:50] <perryprog> julia works fine with the APL alpha though 

[15:50] <razetime> greek alpha is not on my keyboard. wish there was an easy way to type that

[15:51] <Nemokosch> okay but the APL alpha is only on your keyboard because you set it up for APL, right?

[15:51] *** corwin left
[15:51] <Nemokosch> so by the same chance, the Greek alpha could also be on your keyboard

[15:51] <perryprog> but why not allow APL alpha?

[15:51] <Nemokosch> or you could set up the editor to replace them, etc

[15:51] <Marcool04> Hi all

[15:51] <perryprog> o/

[15:51] <Marcool04> any idea what this is about... :

[15:51] <Marcool04> raku -e '"/etc/bash.bashrc".IO.watch'

[15:51] <Nemokosch> Because the APL alpha is not alfanumeric

[15:52] <Marcool04> file watch target queue must have ConcBlockingQueue REPR

[15:52] <Marcool04> 🤨

[15:52] <perryprog> Nemokosch: it's not ⍺numeric?

[15:52] <Nemokosch> that's right

[15:52] <perryprog> Nemokosch: to be clear is, why not allow non-alfanumeric chars

[15:52] <Nemokosch> consult with Unicode :)

[15:52] <perryprog> like julia :P

[15:53] <Nemokosch> I think the idea is that we should be ready for later *symbols*

[15:53] <Marcool04> ah... could it be this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5050

[15:53] <Nemokosch> so it would be kind of arbitrary to rearrange some symbols into identifier characters

[15:54] <Nemokosch> Marcool04: we could try to bisect it for the lolz

[15:54] *** jjido left
[15:55] <Nemokosch> I hope the bot won't shout...

[15:55] <Nemokosch> bisectable6: "/etc/bash.bashrc".IO.watch

[15:55] <bisectable6> Nemokosch, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[15:55] <Nemokosch> prepare for the spam

[15:56] <perryprog> I love bisectable6 so much

[15:57] <perryprog> if only they could do my math homework that involves bisecting that I was just doing :(

[15:57] <Nemokosch> 2022-05-06 then? :P

[15:58] <Marcool04> ahah

[15:59] <Nemokosch> I mentioned lizmat in the issue, maybe she knows

[16:00] <Marcool04> perryprog: bisectable6 is amazing!

[16:00] <Marcool04> Nemokosch: thanks

[16:07] <Marcool04> well, I'm looking at the commit but can't even begin to imagine why it might cause that :/

[23:05] <guifa_> Nemokosch: I figured out my issue with AT-KEY

[23:07] <guifa_> I had a method on a role that was method AT-KEY ($k) { self."$k"() }.  Methods in does Foo seem to take precedence over is Bar.

[23:07] *** habere-et-disper left
[23:08] <lizmat> you should think of roles as macros in the sense that they "insert" code into the consuming class

[23:08] <lizmat> once you realize that, you realize that roles take precedence over inheritance

[23:09] <guifa_> lizmat: yeah.  in my case I had just forgotten that I had that method on the role too :-) 

[23:13] <guifa_> Just going to touch up a few things and I'll push out a big update for Intl::CLDR

[23:13] *** sjn left
[23:13] <guifa_> although now that CLDR supports more languages, I'm going to try to come up with some very lightweight binary compression probably

[23:15] <guifa_> I've got tons of ~50k files that differ by <100 B, I think I could probably could up with something that says "read base file from 0..1234, then insert this data, then read base file from 1300..1980" or something without affecting load performance too badly
