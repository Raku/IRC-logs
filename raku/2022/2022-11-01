[00:00] <guifa_> hmm, weird

[00:02] <guifa_> I have a subclass B of a subclass A of Hash.  The A subclass overrides AT-KEY / SET-KEY, and the B subclass doesn't define anything for it.  But Raku hangs on calling AT-KEY for B and based on say statements, never calls the A method.

[00:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> are they not submethods by any chance?

[00:07] <guifa_> they're just plain methods, which should mask the Hash implementation (confirmed by .^mro)

[00:07] <guifa_> I'll try submethod

[00:07] <guifa_> something feels fishy but I haven't figured out how to figure out the MRO for a method (just for the type)

[00:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yeah I mean who am I trying to fool, you probably wouldn't fall into that trap

[00:14] <guifa_> well that's just the thing, I feel like I *must* be falling into some trap

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> The trap falling into will continue until raccoons improve.

[00:28] <guifa_> What's stranger about this one is I swear it worked just fine at some point a while ago

[00:29] <guifa_> BUt this is in my CLDR module so golfing it down will take me a while

[00:30] <guifa_> it's an easy enough work around for now (just explicitly giving B an AT-KEY / SET-KEY method, which just call self.Hash::AT-KEY or bomb for SET-KEY) but still, it's weird

[02:55] <japhb> Anton Antonov: `file` is a Unix/Linux standard command for guessing file type based on the file's *contents*, rather than on extension (as is common on Windows, for instance).

[02:56] <japhb> The Mac folk have (or had, at least) yet another different method for this, based on marking binary files with 4-character type identifiers.

[11:23] <guifa_> japhb: yeah, resource forks are mostly gone in the Mac world.  Since most other OSes / file systems (I think it was more embedded in the FS iirc) don't really have an equivalent, it meant the potential for lossy data transfers between systems unless you were being very careful.  But they were really useful used well

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Another one: what do you think of ().min producing Inf and ().max producing -Inf?

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Seems random to me and I couldn't find it in the docs, or any related issues

[15:07] <dutchie> logical enough

[15:10] <dutchie> the idea is that `@a.min min @b.min == (@a, @b).flat.min` is always true even either of @a or @b is empty

[15:10] <dutchie> so .min of an empty list should return an "identity"

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I would say not enough, actually

[15:11] *** Zero_Dogg left
[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> This could be achieved with Nil as well

[15:11] *** Zero_Dogg joined
[15:12] <dutchie> what about ().sum?

[15:12] <dutchie> it's the same idea

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and I think any argument that applies in numeric context, actually fails when the empty list is not an empty *numeric* list

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> including your very example

[15:14] <dutchie> i guess it also falls apart a bit with a &by argument

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The problem is that .min makes sense in non-numeric contexts and it does work in general

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's unlike .sum

[15:18] *** TieUpYourCamel left
[15:18] *** archenoth left
[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> So I think Nil (or even Any) would be a better default, or at least this behavior should be documented, pointing out the special behavior of Inf (~~ Numeric) with regards to non-numeric situations

[19:27] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[19:28] <Xliff> And GTK is this thing: https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/getting_started.html

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> LOL, game dev in Raku is real!

[19:30] <Xliff> Not quite yet.

[19:30] <Xliff> But getting there.... maybe...

[19:30] <Xliff> And TUI games in Raku are already possible.

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> So that means a roguelike is possible?

[19:31] <Xliff> Oh, definitely.

[19:32] <Xliff> Please note, work on GDK4 has just started.

[19:32] <Xliff> I don't plan on starting work on GTK4 until late Q2 2023.

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I see

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Then what would you recommend right now for TUI apps?

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm starting to realize that the "smartmatch with S///" problem boils down to the fact that smartmatch drifted away from its principle

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it is treated as something that only makes sense in boolean context / always produces boolean values

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> however, this is not true, and it is not true exactly around regexes
