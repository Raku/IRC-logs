[08:14] <jjatria> Voldenet: oooh, bug report! Nice. Thanks!

[08:15] <jjatria> I think that's down to me not using `$lock.protect` but that's easily fixed

[08:18] <jjatria> As for `AT-KEY` and friends, I thought about it, but what would the key be? The request URL? I'm guessing you mean at the jar level (rather than the cookie level)

[13:38] <uzl[m]> I am reading today's Rakudo Weekly and looking at the list of presenters, codesections was excited to be back in-person ü§£

[13:38] <uzl[m]> A lot interesting titles so quite the video backlog to go through!

[13:39] <uzl[m]> I am planning to watch some of the Raku videos... Would the person running the Youtube channel be interested in timestamps for the videos? 

[13:40] <uzl[m]> Also will the videos make it to The Raku Conference (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnKoF-TknjGtFIpU3Bc_jUA)?

[13:46] <uzl[m]> CIAvash: I'm failing to build rakudo-bin from AUR. It says "ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified!". Any idea about this?

[14:47] <Voldenet> jjatria: I meant AT-KEY to access SameSite for cookie as string, it wouldy much allow handling any future changes and additions to cookies

[15:34] <jjatria> Voldenet: that should be fairly easy to add, it would basically be an alias for `$cookie.get('samesite')`

[15:38] <Voldenet> there's one inconsistency though: .get('HttpOnly') will not work, but .get('SameSite') will

[15:39] <jjatria> If `.get('HttpOnly')` doesn't work then that's a bug; it _should_ be working

[15:40] <Voldenet> > return .(self) with self.^can($key).first;

[15:41] <jjatria> Ah, that should be canonicalised to lc

[15:43] <jjatria> Voldenet++ spotting bugs left and right üéâ 

[15:48] <CIAvash> uzl: It's mentioned in the comments, you need to import the key via `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --receive-keys DB2BA39D1ED967B584D65D71C09FF113BB6410D0`
