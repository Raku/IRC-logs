[02:27] <Xliff> Oh.. .jupyter-notebook is on :8888

[02:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> On what operating system are you running Jupyter (and Raku, etc.)

[02:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> If you have Python installed, you can try -- in Jupyter -- the Python package "JavaScriptD3". See https://github.com/antononcube/Python-packages/tree/main/JavaScriptD3

[02:32] <Xliff> Linux

[02:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok, I am sure I can try Linux tonight...

[02:33] <Xliff> Yeah. It wants to execute the static/component/codemirror/mode/raku/raku.js file

[02:33] <Xliff> I don't have that file.

[02:35] <Xliff> I probably need D3.js, though don't I?

[02:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> No, you not need "D3.js" -- meaning  it is loaded in the setup cell.

[02:40] <Xliff> Oh! From CDN?

[02:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes -- see the second cell here : https://nbviewer.org/github/antononcube/Raku-JavaScript-D3/blob/main/resources/RandomMandalas.ipynb

[02:41] <Xliff> So why am I seeing 404 from 'http://localhost:8888/static/components/codemirror/mode/raku/raku.js?v=20221227211452' ?

[02:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Actually, not CDN, https://d3js.org .

[02:41] <Xliff> Actually I should have said "Remote" but you get the idea.

[02:42] <Xliff> That link above is local though. That file should exist on my HD... and doesn't. That stops the evaluation.

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> No idea about "raku.js" -- I do not think it is needed. Let me see in "Jupyter::Kernel".

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> Do you have Python installed?

[02:43] <Xliff> Yep. Figured it out.

[02:43] <Xliff> I have to run each cell in order.

[02:43] <Xliff> I forgot that. LOL!

[02:43] <Xliff> What if I only want to generate outlines?

[02:43] <Xliff> How can I generate with stroke and no fill?

[02:44] <Xliff> Ah! "fill => 'none', stroke => 'black'"

[02:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, that I think I put `fill` as an argument.

[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes, that!

[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Just `fill=>''` would suffice.

[02:47] <Xliff> OK, thanks so much! This works great, now!

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, no, sorry, you have to use `fill=>'none'`

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Great!

[02:48] <Xliff> Now to figure out how to make these SVG ready for Blender or somesuch.

[02:48] <Xliff> Thanks.

[02:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ah, good luck! I liked SVG was handled in Jupyter -- "SVG::Plot" examples in "Jupyter::Kernel" -- and decided to figure out the similar handling of D3.js.

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> At some point I might figure out how to program the colored mandalas.

[03:18] <Xliff> I really want to handle the mapping graph types.

[03:18] <Xliff> Di you have any plans for those?

[10:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080>  The plotting of choropleths from Raku via JavaScript requires a fair amount of design work.

[10:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Multiple data structure questions have to be answered and proper / useful / available formats have to be lined up. (Meaning, converters, representations, signatures have to be figured out.)

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> Hm… I was more thinking in terms of GeoJSON and Well Known Text (WKT). There are some Raku modules for WKT. Basically, I want to be able to transfer Raku datasets into WKT and GeoJSON. The actual data as FIPS / ZIP etc. is more of a “second wave” type of data.

[14:29] *** Guest47 left
[14:47] <Xliff> I'll have to look into what WKT is. I admit I am having a bit of a problem understanding what Well Known Text has to do with data. I'll try and research it.

[14:48] <Xliff> The GeoJSON files are available from the TopoJSON site, so there should be no problem. All of that is FIPS based.

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> These links might speed-up your WKT research: https://raku.land/zef:kjpye/Geo::Geometry ,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry

[15:10] <Xliff> Anton: So is your aim to encode all geographical data in GeoJSON or WKT and include them in the distribution?

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> No. I want to be able to specify a (complex) polygon in some way -- say, WKT -- and be able to plot it on map (with stoke color, fill color, etc.)

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@742445366489645080> Whatever data might be available for countries, states, counties, or other types of administrative units can be plotted in that way. I do not plan to include data in the distribution. Or, more precisely, I want to avoid data inclusion as much as possible.

[15:42] <Xliff> Seeing as there is D3.js code that does this already with GeoJSON data.
