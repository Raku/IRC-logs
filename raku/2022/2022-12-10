[22:19] <gobberwartz> yo guys

[22:19] <gobberwartz> how do i get rid of the global?

[22:20] <gobberwartz> https://www.paste.org/123593

[22:20] <lizmat> actually, it's not a global, by a lexical with the compunit as a scope

[22:21] <lizmat> *but

[22:21] <gobberwartz> nitpicker =)

[22:22] <lizmat> well, it *is* important, as it will not conflict with a lexical $register in another compilation  unit (such as a module)

[22:22] <lizmat> I see two ways:

[22:22] <gobberwartz> it's global to the file and we learn that is bad

[22:23] <lizmat> put the my and the execute multis in a block

[22:23] <gobberwartz> that or recursion, yes

[22:24] <gobberwartz> had a little trouble getting this to work, containers tripped me up

[22:24] <lizmat> my constant &bar = do {

[22:24] <lizmat>     my $foo = 42;

[22:24] <lizmat>     sub bar() { $foo }

[22:24] <lizmat> }

[22:25] <gobberwartz> most of the time you don't have to think about them, unless you do, haha

[22:27] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/d1efef0685df8ce3e26cf2afedf6cfa0

[22:28] <lizmat> basically create the multis inside the block, and return the proto at the end, and put that in a lexical at compile time

[22:28] <lizmat> hope that made sense

[22:29] <lizmat> sleep&

[22:29] <gobberwartz> killall sleep
