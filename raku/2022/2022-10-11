[10:14] <tellable6> 2022-10-06T11:51:46Z #raku <lizmat> Nemokosch: fwiw, with static optimization enabled, a -1 will be codegenned as a WVal of -1

[10:15] <Nemokosch> m: my @test = <1 2 3> X[&slip] <a b c>; dd @test;

[10:15] <Nemokosch> why can't it unroll the slips?

[10:15] <Nemokosch> if I copy the output as a literal, that will unroll

[10:17] <Nemokosch> using <== instead of = also doesn't help

[10:18] <lizmat> I think the X metaop doesn't honor the special functionality of slip  :-(

[10:18] <lizmat> perhaps something we forgot in the GLR

[10:19] <lizmat> this off the top of my hat

[10:20] <Nemokosch> is there maybe a way to command a list to unwrap the slips inside?

[10:21] <lizmat>  eh

[10:21] <lizmat> meh

[10:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> from what I see, the Scalar container shouldn't be a problem with slips

[10:33] <lizmat> a Slip in a scalar container won't slip

[10:33] <lizmat> m: my $a = (1,2,3).Slip;  .say for $a

[10:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar feb04dbe9: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤»

[10:33] <lizmat> hmmm

[10:34] <lizmat> hmmmmm

[10:37] <Nemokosch> I don't know if that's two wrongs or one wrong but the behavior of X still seems magic

[10:41] <lizmat> agree

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it must be a data structure, though, because it can be copied/fed into other variables and it preserves the same format

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's stable in this regard

[16:01] <tbrowder> .tell tonyo FYI i've been beating my head about the formatter unique class issue and no matter what i do, the symbols leak into the scope of any using program. i am now using a random class name based on a modified uuid from module UUID::V4 since the class name doesn't actually show in user output. that seems to work well so far.

[16:01] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tonyo

[16:01] <tonyo> you mean trying to make them unique each time the generator is run?

[21:55] <hythm> is there a rakuish way to delete a file at the exit of a program (the file should be deleted in all cases, if the program ended normally or due to unhand-led exception)?

[21:57] <melezhik> I am reconsidering all my previous experience with Sparrow and creating a design draft for SparrowCI - completely new CI system built on top of Sparrow/Sparky - ideas, comments are welcome - https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI

[21:58] <melezhik> all low level building blocks are already in place , so it'll be relatively easy to build a new system, however I want to spend to more time on end user API

[21:58] *** labster left
[21:58] <melezhik> this is where I'd need help from community

[21:59] <melezhik> the main idea this is going to be completely language agnostic system with many languages support, built however with Raku. ...

[22:01] <tbrowder> melezhik: i wish i had time to set up and use yr stuff because it would help ease the burden of multi remote servers for sure. good luck. i’m still going thru recent raku con video stuff. did you do one on sparky and friends?

[22:02] <melezhik> I did one on Tomtit, not Sparky/Sparrow however, Tomtit would give one a sense of Sparrow

[22:04] <lizmat> hythm:  END $file.unlink

[22:05] <lizmat> hythm:  END (ENTER my $file = $*TMPDIR.add("foo")).unlink

[22:06] <tbrowder> melezhik: thnx

[22:12] <hythm> lizmat thanks, that worked.

[22:14] <hythm>  I tried that before and it wasn't working for me. but I have explicit `exit 1` inside the CATCH block, that is probably the reason why the file wasn't deleted when an exception occur

[22:15] <hythm> after removing the explicit `exit` the file got deleted
