[17:31] <[Coke]> TIL about `where` on windows
[17:31] <[Coke]> $*USER
[17:31] <[Coke]> it's empty on windows
[17:31] <[Coke]> I also think that we can't support the IntStr value of $*USER on windows, only Str

[17:52] <[Coke]_> test
[17:53] <[Coke]_> there is no number ID I see, only a GUID (git bash has 'id' which does show something numeric, but I can't see something like that from a CMD prompt)
[17:54] <[Coke]_> so I sent several sends while semi-disconnected that the logger never saw, but I got no error that they were not delivered.
