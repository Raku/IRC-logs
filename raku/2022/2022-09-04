[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I'm seeing some really weird behavior: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73599629/nativecall-to-windows-api-function-regqueryinfokeyw-resulting-in-inconsistent-an?noredirect=1#comment129969425_73599629

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyone have any inkling on what the issue might be?

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> probably has something to do with garbage collection maybe?

[14:36] <nine> stevied: what happens when you set MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 ?

[14:36] <tellable6> nine, I'll pass your message to stevied

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> @nine, thanks, I'll give it a shot.

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I discovered that if I get rid of the loop entirely and manually call the win api function, everything works perfectly.

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> but let me try that magic setting there now

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> nine: yup! that did the trick. holy cow. what does that tell us?

[14:48] <nine> That there is a spesh or JIT bug :/ Can you please try again with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 instead of MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1?

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> give me a sec, not familiar with env variables in powershell

[14:53] *** axmed joined
[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> nine, with SPESH removed and JIT added to env, the problem has returned

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> >     my &unique-char = { (once $str.comb.BagHash»--){$_}:!exists }

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> damn, it's still readable

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> can we obfuscate it further?

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 😄

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> nine should I report this bug? Is there any kind of workaround for my code that would make it work without the env variable setting?

[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> nine I found a workaround

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> If I move the RegEnumKeyExW from outside the loop and into the loop, it works perfectly.

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> see https://stackoverflow.com/a/73600441/1641112

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> thanks for helping me troubleshoot this. was driving me crazy.

[15:31] <ugexe> well if its a JIT issue you can only rely on that its worked around on your specific computer at this specific instance

[16:03] <nine> It's a spesh issue and definitely worth reporting.

[20:52] <Nemokosch> .

[20:52] <tellable6> 2022-09-02T18:08:24Z #raku <p6steve> nemokosch: I imagine something like this ... interesting

[20:52] <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2) >>~>> ' ' <<~<< <a b c> andthen .raku.say

[20:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «("1 a", "2 b", "1 c")␤»

[20:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't mind that it works the way it does but it would be nice to know the reason

[20:53] <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2) >>~<< <a b c>

[20:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «Potential difficulties:␤    Useless use of >>~<< in sink context␤    at <tmp>:1␤    ------> (1, 2) ⏏>>~<< <a b c>␤Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of infix:<~> are not of the same length while recursing␤left: 2 elements, r…»

[20:54] <Nemokosch> so yeah, this wouldn't work, "non-dwimmy" and all

[20:54] <Nemokosch> but "transitively" it did work

[20:55] *** Nemokosch left
[20:55] <guifa> The arrows are one of those things I forget exactly how they work, even though I know there is a logic to them haha

[21:01] *** Nemokosch joined
[21:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can make it worse...

[21:01] <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2) <<~<< ' ' <<~<< <a b c> andthen .raku.say

[21:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of infix:<~> are not of the same length while recursing␤left: 2 elements, right: 1 elements␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:05] <Nemokosch> could someone put it into words what happened here?

[21:05] <Nemokosch> as opposed to the >>~>> ' ' <<~<< case

[21:33] *** Xliff joined
[22:21] *** sena_kun left
[22:33] <gfldex> `(1, 2) <<~<< ' '` the LHS got 2 elements and the RHS 1. So the arrows point in the wrong direction.

[22:43] *** Nemokosch joined
[22:43] <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2) <<~<< ' ' andthen .say

[22:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of infix:<~> are not of the same length while recursing␤left: 2 elements, right: 1 elements␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:45] <Nemokosch> not exactly:

[22:45] <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2) <<~<< (' ',) andthen .say

[22:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «(1 )␤»

[22:46] <Nemokosch> Actually I wonder if there isn't an issue for stuff like `(1, 2) <<~<< ' '` to work

[22:46] <Nemokosch> anyway, didn't buy the explanation, this is not about length

[22:48] <gfldex> m: (1, 2) «~» ' ' andthen .say

[22:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10066021a: OUTPUT: «(1  2 )␤»

[22:51] <Nemokosch> the hyper meta-operator isn't documented too well, we already know that

[22:52] <Nemokosch> > They apply a given operator enclosed (or preceded or followed, in the case of unary operators) by « and/or » to one or two lists, returning the resulting list, with the pointy part of « or » aimed at the shorter list.

[22:52] <Nemokosch> this is simply not true - you can aim towards the longer list as well and that also seems to have a pretty clear semantics

[22:54] <Nemokosch> the direction of the arrow determines the direction of the data flow, somewhat like with the feed operator

[22:55] <Nemokosch> > Single elements are turned to a list, so they can be used too.

[22:55] <Nemokosch> This is something that didn't happen in the first example: ' ' wasn't turned into a list, and if it were, the same call would have succeeded

[22:55] <Nemokosch> so two subsequent statements are wrong in two different ways: in the first case, the actual behavior is more reasonable than the docced behavior; in the second case, it's vice versa

[22:58] *** nopy joined
[22:59] <nopy> hello. For C++ project I want to use a simpler, probably dynamic language to develop front-ends. Would you recommend Rakudo for that?

[23:00] <nopy> Previously I've used Python but that turned out to be a massive headache :(

[23:00] <Nemokosch> hence the name, right? :D

[23:01] <nopy> Python is easy, but it is a trap really

[23:01] <Nemokosch> Hi good sir. In fact, Rakudo is the name of the state-of-art Raku compiler, not the language itself. Also, I don't know why you struggled with Python as your scripting language - if it was too heavyweight, then I'm afraid Raku has no chance to be a better option

[23:03] <nopy> It wasn't too heavy weight. But a ton of little problems needed hacks and that is just a massive time sink

[23:03] <nopy> Like little GUI freezes because of the GIL that is really hard to work around

[23:04] <gfldex> C++ bindings are not well supported by NativeCall. You may end up with C-shims. If that is fine for you, Rakudo might be worth a shot.

[23:04] <nopy> where you have to call into C, unlock the GIL, do the threading in C, call from C back to python and so on

[23:05] <nopy> I've seen that already and I don't think that would be a problem.

[23:06] <nopy> Are there any good GUI bindings available?

[23:08] <gfldex> see: https://raku.land/?q=gnome

[23:12] <Nemokosch> Leon had that interesting idea about integrating with Gnome objects...

[23:12] <Nemokosch> now we know one person who would be interested :D

[23:14] <nopy> ty

[23:15] <nopy> Can Rakudo be embedded?

[23:16] <nopy> nvm. just seen the moarvm code ^^

[23:23] <nopy> the gtk bindings are really good and comprehensive. wow

[23:24] <guifa> That's mostly all Xliff's work, IIRC.  EXtremely thorough work

[23:26] <nopy> how can pass around integer arrays of sizes non-native to raku like int16_t* ?

[23:41] <ugexe> Detected: Program:Win32/Bearfoos.B!ml, Affected items: C:\rakubrew\bin\rakubrew.exe

[23:58] *** evalable6 left

[23:58] <nopy> is it normal that rakudo is that ram/cpu intensive?

[23:59] *** linkable6 joined
[23:59] <nopy> my html/JS front-end has about ~20k LOC. I generated a raku script with 20k LOC but that eats 800 MB ram and takes 20 secs to parse.
