[00:18] <Oshawott> So! Does anyone here know how to cross-compile rakudo?

[00:19] <Oshawott> I can compile moar-vm with --gen-moar's --moar-options to set the right host and build

[00:20] <Oshawott> But rakudo itself seems to pretty stubbornly want to compile for my current architecture

[00:20] <Oshawott> (I'm trying to package rakudo for Termux, and their builder cross-compiles)

[00:21] <Oshawott> -rwxrwxrwx 1 archenoth archenoth 4.3M Oct 13 18:16 rakudo_2022.07_aarch64.deb

[00:21] <Oshawott> archenoth@Jirachi ~/Desktop/a $ find -name 'rakudo' -exec file {} \;

[00:21] <Oshawott> ./data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/rakudo: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

[00:22] <Oshawott> (So, the aarch deb contains x86_64 binaries)

[00:23] <Oshawott> This is what my Configure.pl invocation is looking like:

[00:23] <Oshawott> ARCH="${TERMUX_ARCH}" CC=clang AR=llvm-ar ./Configure.pl --gen-moar --moar-option="--build=${TERMUX_BUILD_TUPLE}" --moar-option="--host=${TERMUX_HOST_PLATFORM}" --moar-option="--ar=llvm-ar" --moar-option="--cc=clang" --gen-nqp --backends=moar --prefix=$TERMUX_PREFIX

[00:23] <Oshawott> The env variables were mostly me grasping at straws because I can't find anything in Configure.pl to set the desired host

[00:24] <Oshawott> (This is the rakudo Configure.pl)

[00:26] <Oshawott> I stole the moar cross-compilation options from Debian's moarvm package here: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/moarvm (The source)

[00:26] <Oshawott> But rakudo only has one arch: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/rakudo

[00:26] <Oshawott> It's labelled as "all", but is actually just x86_64 as well

[00:27] <Oshawott> Ubuntu just kinda delegated to Debian

[00:27] <Oshawott> So I don't really have any references for working cross-compiles

[00:28] <Oshawott> Does anyone have any hints where I could look to figure this out..?

[00:28] <Oshawott> tl;dr - no idea how to cross-compile rakudo because I'm unfamiliar with how ./Configure.pl could set that up

[02:05] <MasterDuke> Oshawott: do you see any difference if you use the MoarVM option `--compiler=clang` instead of `--cc=clang`? MoarVM's Configure.pl --help suggests that's a more complete way to use llvm

[02:09] *** masukomi joined
[02:10] *** masukomi left
[02:15] <Oshawott> Oh, --compiler=clang makes the script ignore the --host and --build options, so it doesn't try to cross-compile MoarVM

[02:15] <Oshawott> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/Configure.pl#L1099

[02:16] <Oshawott> The version of the arguments where you give the host triple and tuple doesn't have a --compiler option in it

[02:17] <Oshawott> (It actually complains that I didn't pass --host if I supply both --host and --compiler, and it can't run the probe binaries it compiles)

[02:19] <Oshawott> Wild huh?

[02:20] *** frost joined
[02:21] <MasterDuke> ah. unfortunately i don't know much about cross-compiling, but [Coke] pinged nwc10 over in #moarvm. he's likely to know a lot more, but this is pretty late in his timezone so probably won't be able to respond for a while

[02:26] <Oshawott> Oh! That's okay! And ooh, thank you..! I super-appreciate it hahah

[02:28] <Oshawott> I'm not really in a hurry or anything, but I figured after just kinda stumbling on the Reddit post about running it on Termux, what it would take to make a proper package for it, since I've done that before for a few games~ ^^

[02:31] <Oshawott> I'm not really good at Perl, so the build system has been a bit of a trick to figure out, but Raku has always seemed like a really interesting language to me! So I wanted to do my best to bring it to a platform I care a lot about

[02:31] <MasterDuke> always happy to have people helping out

[02:32] <Oshawott> (Hm! Maybe I'll hop over to that other channel too!)

[14:44] <Nemokosch> [Coke]: I'm afraid someone would need a 2019.03.1 version to even figure it out

[14:44] <tonyo> [Coke]: your response to 4546 looks sane

[14:44] <tonyo> rational, maybe

[14:49] <Nemokosch> building 2019.03.1 in the meantime...
