[09:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Is it intentional `when` doesn't exist as a statement modifier?

[09:21] <lizmat> but it does?

[09:21] <lizmat> m: $_ = 42; .say when 42

[09:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[09:22] <lizmat> m: $_ = 42; .say when Int

[09:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[09:22] <lizmat> m: given 42 { .say when Int }

[09:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[09:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well then

[09:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> all I can say I found it earlier in a medium article about Perl than in the Raku documentation

[09:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Perhaps I misremembered that statement modifiers get a search entry; tbh it's not easy to notice unless you are explicitly checking it

[16:32] <[Coke]> ugh, I have a module that has 1.03 (soon to be 1.04) in git, but is stuck on 1.01 on cpan.

[16:50] <kiti_nomad[m]> This book is about raku, and when the book was written, raku was also called perl6. This book introduces some ideas of raku design, and it is very beneficial for beginners to understand raku
