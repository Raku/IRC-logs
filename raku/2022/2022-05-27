[20:02] <drakonis> they decidedly need it

[20:02] <drakonis> as does raku too

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Fair enough but whenever I hear about the stuff they are trying to establish (signatures, try-catch), I do feel it was absolutely justified to rework this language and unlike Raku, I'm not sure how they can make it seem... modern

[20:29] <drakonis> they cannot

[20:30] <drakonis> as that would break backwards compatibility

[20:34] <drakonis> its too late in perl's life to even manage that without breaking all existing code

[20:36] <drakonis> the biggest change that would happen in years to perl would be the introduction of a object system mostly cribbed from raku

[20:36] <drakonis> and adapted to perl's limitations

[20:38] *** systems left
[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but then why not just accept that Perl is literally finished?

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It will be better than any shell implementation out there, for a long time

[22:55] <rjbs> What does "literally finished" mean?

[23:00] <Voldenet> some of my ancient perl scripts written 10+ years ago still work, so perl is alive… enough ;)

[23:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Like why pretend there is any reason or opportunity to develop Perl "further"

[23:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it has arrived to the destination a long time ago

[23:07] <Voldenet> well, you can't tell people developing perl5 to stop

[23:08] <drakonis> perl 5 has a technical barrier it cannot surpass

[23:09] <rjbs> Perl 5.36 will be slightly more pleasant to work in than 5.34.  That seems like enough to me.

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Perhaps I can't but if we think about why I can't

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's not necessarily because I'm wrong

[23:10] <drakonis> it has reached the end of its evolutionary cycle within the current implementation

[23:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> And you know, from what I see, the improvements don't necessarily target newcomers

[23:11] <leont> Arguably that is true of almost all languages, really

[23:11] <tellable6> 2020-08-13T06:45:00Z #raku-dev <JJMerelo> .tell leont I still need you to accept the invitation so that the article carries your byline (and you can edit it if necessary)

[23:11] <leont> Wow, that is an old message, have I really been inactive that long?

[23:11] <drakonis> eh

[23:11] <drakonis> that depends

[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> They target long-time users with the promise of making life always a bit easier

[23:12] <rjbs> yes.

[23:13] <leont> Yeah, that seems like a fair assessment

[23:13] <drakonis> its entirely reliant on whether the language is designed on the ability to evolve without spending incalculable manpower to do so

[23:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I was trying to come up with a parallel. I thought I couldn't just compare Perl to markdown, lol

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But maybe I could compare it to git, for example

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Nothing revolutionary is to be expected from git in the near future, I'm inclined to say "future" overall

[23:16] <drakonis> the evolution of perl or lack thereof is entirely dictated by a small in-group

[23:17] <drakonis> git has steadily developed some nice improvements

[23:17] <leont> The evolution of perl is entirely dictated by the unusual breadth of its application

[23:18] <drakonis> is it?

[23:18] <drakonis> couldnt the same be said of other languages?

[23:18] <leont> I don't think anything else quite tries to cover anything from one-liners to multi-million liners.

[23:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But if there will be better or at least more hip 'n' cool choices in 20 years, git never will regain popularity

[23:18] <rjbs> drakonis: In what way does this in-group dictate its evolution?

[23:19] <drakonis> p5p

[23:20] <leont> Perl isn't a language, it's a sprachbund. The way people write awk-replacement perl is so vastly different from the way people write web-application perl that it's really a different language that just happens to run on the same interpreter.

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> There is PHP, there is even Python if you will

[23:20] <rjbs> drakonis: That's not much of an answer.

[23:20] <drakonis> i'm writing it

[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I can't confidently state that PHP is the positive counterpart of language development but it's definitely a whole different attempt and I think it's more successful for the given goal

[23:21] <leont> Keeping both groups happy is exceedingly difficult. Raku made the decision not to try to be an awk-replacement on top of being a general purpose programming language, and that makes its life infinitely easier

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> especially given the fact that PHP pretty much became infamous as the language with horrible design or the lack thereof xD

[23:23] <Voldenet> raku is valid awk replacement IMO

[23:23] <drakonis> rjbs: perl hasnt really changed in any meaningful way and p5p has attempted to bolt raku features into it, with not much success

[23:23] <Voldenet> you can do `raku -ne` for instance

[23:23] <rjbs> I don't think p5p has attempt to "bolt raku features into perl5" as such since 2007.

[23:23] <leont> Voldenet: but when it has to compromise, it will always choose to optimize for general purpose programming over text-stream editing

[23:24] <Voldenet> Ah, of course, that's most sane approach

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> actually, I don't know if Raku has any drawbacks to Perl, besides performance in many cases still

[23:24] <rjbs> Perl 5 has constraints on how much it can be changed without significantly breaking backward compatibility, and also by the existing single implementation.  Also, I don't see how this is an "in-group dictating".

[23:24] <rjbs> (At least, not any more than any project with a set of committers is.)

[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or at least not drawbacks that you could pinpoint as "use-case killers"

[23:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > without significantly breaking backward compatibility

[23:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think we are getting to the point haha

[23:26] <drakonis> yes

[23:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm no expert in this area but my gut feeling is that the supposed Perl5 to Perl6 change was WAAAAY bigger than, say, the Python2 to Python3 change

[23:27] <drakonis> now, that's exactly the issue, it is limited by a combination of technical limitations and backwards compat

[23:27] <rjbs> Yes. That is absolutely the truth.

[23:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and when I look at the Perl topics, I think I know the reason

[23:28] <drakonis> raku has liberated itself from these issues

[23:28] <drakonis> which is truly excellent

[23:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> There was just way more things worth fixing in Perl5 than in Python2

[23:28] <rjbs> Here is my point:  Perl is not "absolutely finished".  It has significant constraints on its possible evolutions.  Perl is not "dictated by a small in-group".  It has a development team and is answerable to an installed base.

[23:29] <rjbs> Many languages can be successful within their own constraints, which may be large or small, without having to build their success on painting other languages in an unnecessarily negative light.

[23:30] <drakonis> accurate

[23:30] <drakonis> it does happen a lot more often than it needs, which is not at all

[23:30] <leont> Ironically (given my opinions in perl-land), I have sometimes felt like Raku was a little too careful with breaking things. Like, it's easy to do that before success, but much harder to do later.

[23:31] <drakonis> it broke enough to enable the ability to change itself

[23:31] <Voldenet> you could always make raku2 and rename it into something else ;)

[23:32] <drakonis> a grandiose plan :)

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> There are things I find like "zero-day" design mistakes in Raku, most are sigil-related...

[23:33] <drakonis> i wonder how many of these could go away and nobody would care

[23:34] <drakonis> besides having to update all of the documented code of course

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but like... what is a dirty hack or a dream in Perl is just _basic_ in Raku

[23:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> rjbs: call it whatever you wish but still talking about try-catch and signatures in a traditional, predominantly imperative-style language is a deal breaker in 2022

[23:37] <rjbs> What _what_ whatever I wish?

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> perhaps one can please the oldschool guys with getting that sort of stuff right but it will not attract new users

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> If it will, they won't come from proper programming languages but horrible shell implementations

[23:39] <rjbs> I never brought up attracting new users.

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and for that, frankly it doesn't matter whether there is try-catch and stuff like that

[23:40] <leont> Does anyone really know what will attract new users? Serious question.

[23:41] <Voldenet> It's probably hard for perl 5 to compete with raku anyhow

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what would be a measure of moving forward then? 🤔

[23:41] <rjbs> Half an hour ago, I said: Perl 5.36 will be slightly more pleasant to work in than 5.34.  That seems like enough to me.

[23:42] <drakonis> a compelling language for early adopters, a decent amount of libraries for later adopters

[23:42] <rjbs> "compelling

[23:42] <rjbs> "compelling" is begging the question.

[23:42] <leont> I have ideas (and am likely to blog them some time soon actually), but it's a not really a hard science. If only because anything that works will quickly be copied by others

[23:43] <drakonis> as in something that is worth learning?

[23:43] <drakonis> but that varies from a person to another

[23:43] <Voldenet> worth learning? Latin, definitely

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > Perl 5.36 will be slightly more pleasant to work in than 5.34.  That seems like enough to me.

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Well I guess we could figure out where to settle that goalpost

[23:43] <rjbs> I mean that if Leon says "what makes new users want to learn something" the answer can't be "features that they find compelling". :)

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ~~Latin-1~~

[23:45] <Voldenet> …I have some perl 5 scripts in use, not massive but somewhat maintained and I'd like signatures in perl5

[23:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Because I can buy the idea that Perl 5.36 is essentially unnecessary but also the idea that it doesn't change the big picture and feels more like a patch than a kind of upgrade

[23:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how do these two things add up?

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because you cleverly avoided connecting the two statements 🙂

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> by the way, for signatures... I for one don't think the lack of function signatures would be a terrible loss, theoretically. However, there are certain mainstream expectations to match. I feel that the lack of function signatures is like 20% bothersome and 80% just "uncool"

[23:50] <Voldenet> but that 20% is enough to make it an improvement

[23:51] <Voldenet> imho there's always room to improve languages, even if new versions aren't introducing anything exciting

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean yes, definitely

[23:51] <leont> Same with try/catch really. It doesn't enable anything that wasn't possible before, but it makes it more accessible.

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and getting away from an "uncool" stigma is also more than enough, honestly

[23:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's more that supposedly fundamental stuff like this is going so slowly - because breaking compatibility is very much a taboo - that it really takes dedication to feel the improvement

[23:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like you know, it's pretty hard to get that intense air draft of a Cadillac cabriolet if you are sitting on a... camel

[23:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> most people won't be like "wooohoo, here we go baby"

[23:59] <rjbs> The target audience is perl5 programmers who plan to upgrade.  You don't think they're likely to be excited by the changes in v5.36.0?

[23:59] <Voldenet> perl5 is not a camel, it's more of a car where you control speed with hands and turn with your feet

[23:59] <Voldenet> it works, but it's sort of weird
