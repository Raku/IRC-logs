[14:32] <tbrowder> .ask ugexe does zef require any special ports other than 80/tcp and 443/tcp?

[14:32] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[14:40] <jgaz> question: assuming a manually compiled install, should modules be rebuilt every time rakudo is upgraded?

[14:41] <ugexe> tbrowder: it requires whatever the fetchers you use require. if all your modules are local then you don't need any ports. if you are fetching modules over http or https then you would need whatever curl/wget/etc use (80/443)

[14:42] <ugexe> jgaz: they will be recompiled when you upgrade

[14:42] <ugexe> not rebuilt (i.e. running a Build.rakumod file)

[14:43] <tbrowder> ugexe: thanks

[14:44] <jgaz> ugexe: thanks. I'm trying to improve Gentoo's support for Raku and this was an open question.

[15:54] <lizmat> jgaz: yes, they will be automatically rebuilt whenever you try to load it 

[15:55] <lizmat> s/it/ a module

[15:57] <jgaz> lizmat: thanks for confirming.

[15:58] <lizmat> as soon as that changes, a module needs to be re-precompiled

[16:13] <ugexe> which is not the same as being built technically

[16:13] <ugexe> building a distribution involves running e.g. Build.pm

[16:15] <tbrowder> ugexe: i am having zef problems on a pristine digital ocean droplet running debian 11. i have installed raku through El_Che's rakudo-pkg and installed zef for both root and my normal user with the package's /opt/rakudo-pkg/install-zef script.

[16:21] <suman> What version of Unicode does Rakudo support? Is it 13.1 ? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM

[16:23] <ugexe> tbrowder: maybe try running the example here to see if the curl plugin works -- https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7c46ca2d5a1f78c86a5c543c4080774b30770ddb/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/curl.rakumod#L15-L26

[16:23] <tbrowder> ok, wilco

[16:24] <ugexe> if that example runs for you then it seems like maybe its trying to save the ecosystem files to a location it doesn't have permissions for

[16:24] <ugexe> although that would require rakudo-pkg to modify the zef config (which i doubt it does)

[16:25] *** morte_ joined
[16:26] <ugexe> you might also try this example to test the ecosystem plugin itself instead of the curl plugin -- https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7c46ca2d5a1f78c86a5c543c4080774b30770ddb/lib/Zef/Repository/Ecosystems.rakumod#L18-L32

[16:30] <[Coke]> wonder if curl by itself is working.

[16:31] <ugexe> i imagine debian has perl which is one of he backup plugins

[16:32] <ugexe> actually n/m there is no perl fetcher, its a perl extractor

[16:32] *** jgaz left
[16:33] <tbrowder> FYI the curl code in the rakudo-pkg install instructions worked

[16:33] *** jgaz joined
[16:34] <tbrowder> but neither of the two scripts nick suggested worked. is there a raw curl one-liner to try (i'm no regular curl user)?

[16:35] *** jjido joined
[16:35] <tbrowder> the first script error was: 

[16:35] <tbrowder> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ATG7u9jf/

[16:36] <tbrowder> the second was:

[16:36] <tbrowder> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/aps0l6Gm/

[16:36] <ugexe> you'd probably have to add a `say $proc.raku` after https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7c46ca2d5a1f78c86a5c543c4080774b30770ddb/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/curl.rakumod#L84 so you can see what the full command being used is and then you could run it manually

[16:36] <tbrowder> ok

[16:37] <ugexe> to do so change to a dir you clone zef into, make that modification, then run `raku -I. bin/zef list` to run that zef in that dir

[16:38] <ugexe> the output of `say $proc.raku` might get captured though so maybe `"debug-data.txt".IO.spurt($proc.raku)` would work better
