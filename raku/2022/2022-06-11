[12:32] <ToddAndMargo> Hi All.  I am over on https://docs.raku.org/type/Str and I am drawing a blank.   I would like to be able to read and write to a single character index in a string.  For example `my $s = "abxdef"; $s[2]="c"`;  How do I do this? (I need the exact index, not a regex)

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I wonder whose idea it was that strings cannot be indexed...

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> however, what you want to do in particular, is not nice either way

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> mutable strings are way out of fashion

[12:35] <ToddAndMargo> can I convert a string into a Buf and then back afterwards?

[12:36] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> this is it https://docs.raku.org/routine/substr-rw

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you want mutability on a per-index base, you'd be better of just using an Array

[12:37] <ToddAndMargo> substr-rw will work.  Thank you!

[12:40] *** thundergnat_ joined
[12:41] <thundergnat_> ToddAndMargo: or perhaps String::Splice?  https://raku.land/github:thundergnat/String::Splice

[12:42] <ToddAndMargo> that is interesting.  I am writing it down for the future!

[16:16] <patrickb> I fail to find the documentation for the method invocant specifier (or what else it's called), the `method bla(Invocant:D:)` thing in method signatures. Can someone point me to the right place?

[16:29] *** Sgeo joined
[16:34] <[Coke]> It's "invocant marker", I see it on type/Signature but not linked to

[16:35] <[Coke]> (and with no actual documentation, it's just referenced)

[16:42] <patrickb> Ouch. That's one of the things that will definitely have to be in the "Signature quick intro" we might link to from all signatures in the docs...

[16:42] <patrickb> Thanks!

[16:46] <uzl[m]> <discord-raku-bot> "<Nemokosch#9980> uzl: I pointed..." <- As per 2022.06, both `max 0, False` and `0 max False` return the same value, namely `0`. Where I am confused is with the commit's header "Make &[max] and &[min] return RHS for ties". If `0 max False` returns 0 (as expected), then it's returning its LHS, not its RHS.

[17:21] <melezhik> I am going add alpine package support for Raku modules into SparkyCI soon, using this approach

[17:22] <melezhik> so community would enjoy blazingly  fast installation of Raku modules under alpine
