[19:54] <tbrowder> hi, i want to put a binary file in a module's resources subdir, and, according to the docs, i should be able to get a path to it like this (inside a module): "my $path = %?RESOURCES<images/binary.jpg>.absolute" but i get an error (like /:i slip/)
[19:56] <tbrowder> i've looked at using the published module "Distribution::Resources::Menu" but i should be able to avoid that.
[19:56] <tbrowder> ideas, anyone?

[20:49] <leont> When passing a Nil to a conversion type, I would expect that to be turned into the type object of the destination type, but apparently it doesn't do that. Not quite understanding my error yet though as I can't easily minimize it.

[21:03] <tbrowder> hm, can't get it working...still see error...gotta look at rakudo src i tink...
[21:11] <tbrowder> hm, i think i begin to see the light. while the module is NOT installed i must access the resources one way, and another way when it's installed. thus i have to be able to handle the uninstalled module for testing.
[21:16] <tbrowder> sounds like the $?DISTRIBUTION var might work for both situations...
[21:54] *** squashable6 left
[21:54] *** squashable6 joined
[21:55] <ugexe> %?RESOURCES can be accessed the same regardless of if its installed
[21:55] <tbrowder> A
[21:56] <tbrowder> well, i haven't broken the code yet  :-(
[21:56] <ugexe> zef uses %?RESOURCES, and zef can install itself
[21:57] <ugexe> i.e. %?RESOURCES works the same for zef if its installed or no
[21:58] <ugexe> have you posted your code?
[21:58] *** habere-et-disper joined
[22:00] <tbrowder> nick, the $?DISTRIBUTION works well, i showed above one line above, like the docs, and i couldn't get it to work with %*RESOURCES
[22:01] <tbrowder> my module is at github.com/tbrowder/GraphicsMagick
[22:02] <tbrowder> it test ok locally and on github now
[22:02] <ugexe> one line doesnt tell us if you set it up right
[22:03] <ugexe> if it works with $?DISTRIBUTION it really should work with %?RESOURCES
[22:03] <ugexe> although there is nothing wrong with using $?DISTRIBUTION either
[22:04] <ugexe> you have no resources listed in your META6.json
[22:04] <ugexe> https://github.com/tbrowder/GraphicsMagick/blob/e8e3be983faa45f47163329611df4ebd7148b6c6/META6.json#L19-L20
[22:05] <tbrowder> that's what i thought, but no success. i do not have any resources listed in the META6.json
[22:05] <tbrowder> if that is required, that seems to be redundant
[22:05] <tbrowder> and it's not real clear in the docs
[22:05] <ugexe> its not redundant
[22:06] <ugexe> "If you have any additional files (such as templates or a dynamic library) that you wish to have installed so you can access them at runtime, they should be placed in a resources subdirectory of your project, e.g.:"
[22:06] <ugexe> then right after
[22:06] <ugexe> "The file must then be referenced in META6.json (see below for more on META6.json) so that the distribution path can be provided to the program."
[22:06] *** sena_kun left
[22:07] <ugexe> see https://docs.raku.org/language/modules
[22:07] <tbrowder> i do that, but i don't dup that in META6. to me t(
[22:07] <tbrowder> that's redundant. i didn't do that for DISTRIBUTION
[22:08] <ugexe> your code doesnt work on installation like you think
[22:08] <ugexe> because if the resources arent listed in the META6.json then they arent getting installed
[22:09] <ugexe> if its working its because your environment is setup in a way that most any other user won't have
[22:09] <tbrowder> hm, you're correct i'm sure, because i'm just getting the testing working on github.
[22:11] <tbrowder> either the system ought to fill the META6, or maybe mi6 can handle it. at any rate, the docs need to clearly state the current requirement.
[22:11] <tbrowder> i'll try to post a gist later
[22:12] <ugexe> the docs do state it
[22:12] <ugexe> i quoted it above
[22:13] <ugexe> it also looks like mi6 should populate resources, or at least tries -- https://github.com/skaji/mi6/blob/d96645bd6710be8f451b10b407a0faae4fa080b0/lib/App/Mi6.rakumod#L291
[22:14] <ugexe> actually i dont see any code in there for actually generating it
[22:14] <ugexe> so maybe you'll want to raise an mi6 issue
[22:16] <tbrowder> oh, ok, i've been looking in the "variables" section where RESOURCES and DISTRIBUTION are both discussed. very confusing
[22:16] <tbrowder> modules section is much clearer, sorry
[22:17] <tbrowder> i will file issue for mi6

[22:55] <tbrowder> so done
[22:57] <tbrowder> another subject: what happens when a module in zef is found to have an issue causing failures? can it be removed?
[22:58] <tbrowder> one such floating around is Digest::SHA, ver 0.17.1 which needs to be replaced by ver 0.18.1
[23:02] <[Coke]> removed... from where?
[23:02] <[Coke]> you can uninstall it from your machine; if someone is depending on that version specifically, they need to update their deps.
[23:19] <[Coke]> In your specific case: PDF::Document seems to have changed its deps in the past few days. use to be it needed Text::Utils which needed Temp::Path which needed Digest::SHA - but now Text::Utils doesn't need that.
[23:21] <[Coke]> Temp::Path's dependency is just on Digest::SHA, no version; so you got unlucky; your fix is to 'zef uninstall' it, then zef install it. (or do do an in place upgrade but I don't remember the command for that.)
[23:21] <tbrowder> it looks like Temp::Path (repo unknown) when installing with zef depends on Digest:ver<0.17.1>, but its Meta depends on Digest::SHA but searching for it on modules.raku.org doesn't show it, it shows Digest::SHA1::* and Digest::SHA256::*
[23:21] <[Coke]> it doesn't depend on that version
[23:22] <[Coke]> can you show me the command you're running to show that?
[23:24] <tbrowder> zef install
[23:25] <tbrowder> just a moment. it happens with my new module but i have another doing the same thing...
[23:26] <[Coke]> (the full command)
[23:26] <[Coke]> what specifically are you installing?
[23:27] *** linkable6 left
[23:27] *** evalable6 left
[23:27] <[Coke]> Ah. It doesn't *depend* on that version. it's just that there isn't a more recent version, it seems.
[23:27] *** evalable6 joined
[23:28] *** linkable6 joined
[23:29] <[Coke]> it's reporting that 0.17.1 is from the -rea- archive; REA is where modules go to die, I thought - I'm still not sure why we have that in the default search path.
[23:30] <[Coke]> zef info --/rea Digest::SHA
[23:30] <[Coke]> - Nothing. so it's only in REA, and it's only the old one.
[23:31] <[Coke]> You said you saw a later version in github? Looks like they never cut a release.
[23:34] <[Coke]> lizmat, ugexe: Looks like there *IS* a Digest version 0.18.0 here: https://github.com/Raku/REA/tree/main/archive/D/Digest , but zef is reporting 0.17.1 from REA. Any thoughts?
[23:34] <[Coke]> apologies for emitting a line everytime I found some data instead of waiting. :)
[23:36] <tbrowder> no, please, i'm seeing some other issues on my host i'm using
[23:41] <tbrowder> with my babbling i'm glad to have anyone inject some truth
[23:59] <tbrowder> well, i've nuked my zef stuff, can't recover till later in the week :-(
