[08:33] <p6steve> ah - yes this is what I expected (now I grok that .VAR.WHERE is telling you the location of the contents) - so change both and get two new locations

[08:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> by the way

[08:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is the advantage of using any other backend but MoarVM?

[08:40] <lizmat> some users require the JVM

[08:40] <El_Che> inclusion with an specific ecosystem

[08:40] <lizmat> re the JS backend... the idea that we could run in the browser...  but I think that still need a lot of TLC

[08:40] <El_Che> but I don't think the alternative runtimes are ready for primetime

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I really don't know what it practically means to run code on the JVM, for example

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like does this mean that you can make calls to Java libraries, like with Clojure for example?

[08:49] <lizmat> I understand that that is possible to a degree, bartolin is the local JVM wizard, might know more :-)

[08:51] <El_Che> your get libraries, more memory usage and face-to-face time with oracle lawyers :)

[08:52] <lizmat> understand that the JVM backend was originally developed as a proof-of-concept of being able to run on multiple backends (other than Parrot)

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Yes, this is somewhere along the lines the question

[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> That it sounds nice in theory that you can target different backends but the way I understand, as it stands, there is little reason to use anything but MoarVM

[08:57] <lizmat> I would concur, unless your *really* want the JVM

[08:59] <El_Che> in you're in that ecosystem, it would be a great addition to stuff like kotlyn, groovy, jruby and the like

[09:00] <El_Che> like when you need java stuff but prefer to program in a different lnaguage :)

[10:36] <tbrowder> El_Che: thnx, that's part of the problem. if one installs raku with the official debian raku package, raku is sym linked to one of the standard bin locations so it is not a problem.

[10:37] <tbrowder> can not the rakudo-pkg do the same?

[10:38] *** p6steve left

[10:44] <El_Che> it would mean writing outside of /opt/rakudo-pkg what I would prefer not to do

[10:46] *** frost left
[10:59] <tbrowder> can you provide in yr rakudo-pkg an optional link script which will "do the right thing" to get the same paths as the official debian package?

[11:00] <tbrowder> that would be very helpful for anyone creating such a raku pkg as mine

[11:01] <tbrowder> i can create it, but, imho, it would be much better coming from you

[11:02] <El_Che> it can not be in the same path because it will conflict with the system supplied raku binary

[11:03] <El_Che> the proper way should be adding it to sudoers eg in the secure_path key

[11:04] <El_Che> or link to /usr/local/bin

[11:04] <El_Che> but the sudo config will vary with distros

[11:05] <tbrowder> hm, that sounds good. i'm involved in a debian users email discussion on what is the "correct" way to do that

[11:05] <tbrowder> and there are lots of varying answers

[11:06] <tbrowder> but still,

[11:08] <tbrowder> i like the /usr/loca/link idea better...

[20:35] <Xliff> Is it possible to create a sequence of random enums where the first n are predetermined?

[20:36] *** [Coke]_ joined
[20:37] <lizmat> enums are compile time... so... is that what you want ?

[20:43] <Xliff> Huh... this seems to work.

[20:43] <Xliff> m: enum Alpha <A B C D>; class PredetNEnums does Positional { has @!predet is built; submethod BUILD (:@!predet) { }; method new (*@predet) { self.bless( :@predet ) }; method AT-POS (\k) { return @!predet[k] if k < @!predet.elems; @!predet.head.WHAT.enums.pick.key }; }; my $a = PredetNEnums.new(A, B, C, D, D, A); $a[^10].say

[21:05] <tbrowder> El_Che: i hate to keep bugging you, but now i'm not seeing the root's path to its zef in its home dir :-(
