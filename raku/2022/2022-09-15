[13:48] <tbrowder> yes, i see that, and it may be the problem, but i haven’t looked at it yet.

[13:50] <[Coke]> tbrowder: I see Digest::SHA; possible I'm not parsing the zef output correct, you said there was a specific version that was required.

[13:51] <[Coke]> so maybe the format of 'zef info' output in that I'm not reading right

[14:13] *** Sgeo joined
[14:20] *** kueppo joined
[14:28] <[Coke]> tbrowder: not quite done with double check, but I think you're looking for "Digest" which is provided by "Digest::SHA1"

[14:29] <[Coke]> this script is reporting the package you'd install, not the modules provided by those packages.

[14:31] <[Coke]> and zef isn't reporting that Temp::Path has a specific requirement on Digest::SHA

[14:32] <[Coke]> Doesn't look like it does in its META6.json, at least on github master.

[14:32] <[Coke]> So you might have an old, locally installed module that has a specific version requirement there.

[14:33] *** Heptite joined
[14:35] <tbrowder> yes, thnx. that sounds like a prob with the “real” module. David’s pdf suite is so complex…

[14:36] <[Coke]> hopefully this script will help folks experience similar questions. I can pull into a separate project if folks want something installable with zef.

[18:10] <melezhik> .tell lizmat well technically it works, it just a browser does not allow _by default_ ( unless one asks to ) to visit web site with self signed ssl certificates. it's ok, you don't have too, I will probably fix this later )))

[18:22] <melezhik> @liz

[18:22] <melezhik> lizmat it's not thing wrong with it, for example I use it for https://sparrowhub.io which has "white" ssl cert

[18:23] <melezhik> it's just another application https://sparrowhub.io:4000 use self signed ssl cert

[18:23] <melezhik> the challenge with white (CA authorized) certs is you have to provide a domain name for every apps (you usually don't want to hook all apps on the same domain name, right? )

[18:24] <melezhik> so for me it means to have yet another white ssl cert I will hav to register another domain name

[18:24] <melezhik> say, sparkyci.io or something

[18:24] <lizmat> why not foo.sparrowhub.io ?

[18:24] <melezhik> yeah, this is good idea, actually ))

[18:25] <melezhik> I have never though about utilizing sub domain in that way

[18:26] <melezhik> but in this case sparky would be associated with not very relevant sparriwhub , but in other hand it will get a me a valid ssl cert

[18:26] <lizmat> asking *potential* users to ignore security warnings, is not a good policy to get new users, is all I'm saying

[18:28] <melezhik> yeah, I got that )))

[18:28] <melezhik> I am going to bring an subdomain

[18:28] <melezhik> will let you know
