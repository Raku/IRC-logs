[12:09] <xinming> SmokeMachine: So, this is a regression in 2022.06, Not a Red bug?
[12:10] <lizmat> well, we found the offending commit
[12:10] <SmokeMachine> yes. it seems to...
[12:10] <lizmat> still debating whether that introduced a bug, or uncovered an existing bug
[12:18] <El_Che> will you release a dot raku release (so I should wait to release packages)?
[12:18] <tellable6> 2022-05-31T13:24:10Z #raku <tbrowder> El_Che i think yr current instructions and code vary from yr orig stuff--new has better integration with zef and the origini see several sig diffs on my old host--cleaning house and starting over
[12:18] <tellable6> 2022-05-31T13:43:42Z #raku <tbrowder> El_Che the other thing i noticed was on another old host i had mixed the two methods: manual setup and automated. that was a self-made stew i'm sure
[12:18] <tellable6> 2022-06-05T21:21:35Z #raku-dev <jdv> El_Che 2022.06 release just happened
[12:19] <lizmat> El_Che: not sure yet

[14:40] <lizmat> I'd say push, you've done all the work already, no ?
[14:59] <El_Che> yes, everything is green
[15:00] <El_Che> added new distros (rhel/centos 9 and alpine 3.16)
[15:15] <lizmat> El_Che++
[15:16] <japhb> lizmat: Is the comment about log inspection in the topic out of date?
[15:17] <lizmat> I guess,  :-)
