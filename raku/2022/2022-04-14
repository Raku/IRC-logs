[00:59] <drakonis> as well as making it a bit more usable to non unix platforms

[02:43] <jdv> drakonis: what would that mean?

[02:43] <drakonis> which one?

[02:43] <jdv> all of it

[02:43] <drakonis> ah, okay.

[02:44] <jdv> there is a repl.  i don't use repls so i don't understand that part so you could skip that if you wish.

[02:44] <jdv> the editor and non-unix bits though - not sure what you mean

[02:45] <drakonis> so, the repl experience is bare right now, you can only send in lines of code and get the returned output, improving it would entail adding a lot more interactivity

[02:46] <drakonis> maybe copying CL's repl experience would be nice?

[02:46] <drakonis> the editor experience is quite poor if you're not using comma

[02:47] <drakonis> emacs/vim is still quite non existent at the moment

[02:47] <drakonis> as for non-unix platforms, windows support seems... middling, really?

[02:47] *** frost joined
[02:48] <drakonis> i've been using raku on linux, except that one time i tried to run it on windows while away from my main computer

[02:51] <jdv> so by editor you mean "ide", ok 

[02:52] <jdv> i use vim and it works just fine, for me

[02:52] <jdv> i don't use windows myself but i think its kept up.  anything specific there?

[02:55] <jdv> in any case, improving all sorts of stuff would be nice but there's only so many peeps working on stuff:(

[02:56] <drakonis> indeed.

[02:56] <drakonis> lots and lots of room for improvement

[02:56] <drakonis> but is mainly about improving the baseline

[02:58] <drakonis> nothing specific about windows though

[02:59] <jdv> iirc the vim syntax thing used to be really slow and not otherwise great

[03:00] <jdv> but i think its fine these days 

[03:01] <jdv> i think there's people that reguarly use raku on windows so pretty sure it "works mostly":)

[03:01] <drakonis> i see.

[03:01] <drakonis> good to know.

[03:06] <jdv> https://github.com/Raku/vim-raku is the vim stuff

[03:07] <jdv> and i think more recent versions of vim have more recent versions of that

[04:21] <elcaro> vim sytax highlighting is a little slow, but I only really notice it if I'm holding down 'u' to do a whole bunch of undo's. other than that I find it fine

[04:22] <elcaro> If you use an undo-tree like plugin, then there's probably little to cause you to notice much slowness.

[07:23] <corwin> Perhaps largely due to packages like org-mode (MD like syntax that supports literate programming) and Magit (a git porcelain) Emacs seems to be enjoying something of an uptick in users.  Also, there seem to be over 800 ppl on #emacs.  But then, nobody uses IRC these days either.

[07:25] <grondilu> does emacs support Language Server Protocol?  That seems nice and Vim does not support it well without plugins.

[07:26] <corwin> there are a couple of different ways of getting LSP support in Emacs, ye

[07:27] <corwin> This seems to be a very frequent topic in #emacs, in fact.  I'm not an LSP user so I can't really say much more.

[07:29] <grondilu> LSP could allow for jumping between objects and function definitions, even between different source files.  That's something that would be very nice for raku.

[07:30] <grondilu> I mean I know there is the comma ide, but I'd like to keep using Vim.

[07:30] *** kylese joined
[07:31] *** frost joined
[07:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it would be very nice...

[07:37] <corwin> Emacs has *lots* of ways to jump around, in and between files. I haven't needed LSP just for that.

[07:38] <corwin> Although nothing I'm doing is all that terribly complicated.  I suspect it wouldn't be hard to stump things like `dumb-jump' (which is the main thing I use for this).

[07:39] <corwin> Anyway, end of commercial I guess.  But there are at least a few of us still using Emacs was my actual point.

[07:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, less than Nano users, lol

[07:54] <SmokeMachine> I use nvim‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd like a Raku language server‚Ä¶

[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> let's make a petition for a Raku language server

[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this is at least the fourth time I've seen this brought up

[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> üòÑ

[07:58] <SmokeMachine> Instead of a petition, why not start writing one?  (I think there is one already started‚Ä¶)

[08:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean sure, write one

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if everyone who has ever asked about a Raku LSP started writing one, there would be an abundance of implementations now

[08:06] *** grondilu left
[08:08] *** dakkar joined
[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there can be multiple answers to that if you think about it

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 1. you edit text, not just code. using an IDE for random text structures is usually awkward

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 2. the environment you are working in is too heterogenous to set up IDE's meaningfully

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the latter may or may not include when you only have an ssh connection

[08:11] <CIAvash> I haven't written a language server, but wouldn't it be easier to do after RakuAST lands?

[08:13] <CIAvash> because if you only implement a simple language server which uses `raku -c` to show error messages, then `flycheck-raku` already does that.

[09:22] <CIAvash> well, emacs/vim + LSP is kinda vscode, isn't it(apart from UI, customization,...)? üôÇ

[09:22] <Voldenet> The main difference between emacs/vim and vscode is that the latter was designed as code editor and the former were designed as text editors

[09:29] <Voldenet> truth be told though, vscode is not an actual IDE without extensions

[09:36] <El_Che> I think it's just free as in beer and it does not sucks as electron :)

[09:36] <El_Che> Intellij is a lot better for a lot of languages, but it's expensive

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't like Jetbrains products

[09:37] <El_Che> it gets some getting used to

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> they are resource ineffective, even compared to Electron

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> moreover I had too many problems with them

[09:38] <El_Che> no trouble here

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> non ascii paths and bs like that

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the same effort could go into making Eclipse more user friendly

[09:39] <Voldenet> non-ascii paths and spaces in filenames are great way to discover bugs in tools, ishygddt

[09:39] <El_Che> nah

[09:39] <El_Che> eclipse is a no-no

[09:40] <El_Che> used them all eclipse, netbeans, intellij

[09:42] <Voldenet> idea is best java IDE (and raku IDE with Comma plugin as well), there's nothing close

[09:42] <El_Che> Voldenet: I use intellij mostly for go

[09:43] <El_Che> but it's good for raku and perl as well

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Eclipse is decent, it works, it's free as in freedom

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why ditch it in favor of something that eats your money, your ram and your soul

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and then doesn't even work lol

[09:43] <El_Che> :)

[09:43] <Voldenet> I never needed my soul anyway

[09:44] <El_Che> eclipse and intellij date from another time. intellij is close beta testing Fleet, to compete with vscode in the "hey, I am light" market

[09:44] <El_Che> soul is overrated

[09:45] <El_Che> so is funk

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I thought stuff like this was important among the Raku folks

[09:46] <El_Che> for short stuff I like vim :)

[09:47] <dutchie> while we're on editors, does anybody have any kakoune config for raku? i've just been pretending it's perl, which is just about ok

[09:47] <dutchie> if not maybe i'll try whipping something up over the easter weekend

[09:47] <dutchie> might be worth asking in #kakoune as well

[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and when we are talking vim and emacs, it's implied we don't talk time and date üòõ

[09:47] <El_Che> googling kakoune

[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> same xD

[09:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> frankly the main reason I use vim over other things is that I need a ridiculously portable legacy editor anyway

[09:49] *** grondilu joined
[09:49] <El_Che> it looks like vim

[09:49] <El_Che>  As it‚Äôs also a modal editor, it is somewhat similar to the Vim editor (after which Kakoune was originally inspired).

[09:49] <El_Che> I see

[09:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> when you log in to some SunOS 5.8, what editor can you count on? well, there is some implementation of vi surely...

[09:50] <El_Che> so. many. memories.

[09:50] <El_Che> I started contributing to (Open)CSW because the userspace on Solaris was so poor

[09:50] <grondilu> zef does not show me the latest version of a module I've just updated.  Yet I did 'zef update'.  What may I be missing?

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I kinda hope we can get rid of them eventually

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the hardware itself is brutally expensive nowadays

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but you know, we need to be able to test systems that have been deployed 20+ years ago

[09:54] <MasterDuke> grondilu: you mean you just released a new version of a module, but zef doesn't see the new version is available? depending on what ecosystem, it can take up to an hour iirc for zef to see the update

[09:56] <El_Che> Nemokosch: coming from someone that probably did every sun course, who's stll running Solaris today is a captive. Everyone that could move their stuff to Linux, specially since Oracle took over, already left

[09:56] <El_Che> Nemokosch: the audit Oracle did because they needed to reach financial targets where no fun

[09:57] <El_Che> Nemokosch: meetings with them? Sign a NDA. Give me prices about how much stuff will cose so we can dragt scenarios? nope

[09:57] <El_Che> terrible ecosystem

[10:02] <grondilu> MasterDuke: noted

[10:09] <grondilu> in any case I should be able to use zef to install a module from the local repo, right?

[10:10] <grondilu> so that I don't have to wait after a change?

[10:10] <MasterDuke> yep, `zef install .`

[10:10] * grondilu proceeds to do that

[10:10] <MasterDuke> or just put the local repo path in a `-I`

[10:12] <grondilu> -I would override the zef install?

[10:12] <MasterDuke> yeah

[10:12] <grondilu> ok.  That can be useful.

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you know, railway control systems... that's not something people like to change daily üòÑ

[10:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and the system was originally Sun only I think

[10:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there are Linux ports by now

[10:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's a mess tbh

[10:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> even the versioning

[10:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and my boss said: "well, the 4.7 runs on Linux"

[15:25] <corwin> ohh, flycheck-raku.el!  Nice

[15:26] <corwin> Also, r/emacs seems to have around 60k users while r/vim has closer to 150k.  So I suspect the twitter poll of nearly 200 twitter users *might* not be scientific.

[15:29] <corwin> Doom (an Emacs 'starter kit') seems to have some nice configuration for Raku LSP.  I don't use Doom, so I really dunno.  I wonder if raku-mode could be merged upstream though.  That would be nice.

[15:31] <corwin> Finally, RE "the text editor war is over": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3QF1uAvbkU&ab_channel=WardCo

[15:54] <jast> I tested spacemacs for a while but in the end decided I didn't want to re-learn everything else (the scripting API, subtle differences between different types of windows/panels/... etc.)

[15:54] <jast> so I'm still on vim :)

[15:57] <corwin> vim and emacs both have a steep learning cure. spacemacs, doom, and neovim all attempt to reduce that (on the Emacs side) by coming "pre-configured", making them more like vim in that once you have surmounted the initial learning curve you are done.  Emacs is more of a commitment to learning continuously as long as you remain a user.

[15:58] <corwin> FTR, I don't agree either vi/vim nor Emacs was originally created to edit text (vs programs).  I think both were initially targeting a programming audience some of who's work was expected to be writing plain text.

[16:04] <jast> however both are still useful for editing text once you've learned some of the tricks

[16:08] <corwin> most definitely. I've been an Emacs user for decades and know very little vim yet I do use it all the time for little edits, like when I'm ssh'ed somewhere and don't want fire up a tramp (Emacs' way to edit files over SSH) session.  I'd say both are worth knowing at least a little aboutt.

[18:51] <MasterDuke> mostly

[18:52] <MasterDuke> there might be some compilation problems, but i believe those would be pretty quick fixes. it might become a bit less accurate after rakuast lands

[18:53] <drakonis> just a bit?

[18:54] <MasterDuke> dunno, i haven't looked at it in detail in a while. i'd suggest asking jnthn over in #moarvm

[18:55] <drakonis> by the way, is there a way to generate a code block?

[18:56] <drakonis> or convert a list to a code block?

[18:57] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure what you mean. list of strings?

[18:57] <drakonis> sure

[18:57] *** dogbert17 left
[18:57] *** dogbert17 joined
[18:58] <drakonis> a list of subroutine calls even

[18:59] <drakonis> i guess what i want edges quite closely to what macros do

[18:59] <MasterDuke> i assume you want something more than `my &code = @strings.join("\n").EVAL`?

[18:59] <drakonis> hmm

[18:59] <drakonis> i'm interested.

[18:59] <drakonis> yes

[19:00] <MasterDuke> ha, well this isn't an area i've spent much time in. masak_ would be good to talk to

[19:00] <drakonis> its mainly for dealing with code generation for my automation framework

[19:01] <MasterDuke> they're experimental, but macros currently can do some things

[19:01] <drakonis> plus a touch of file generators

[19:02] <drakonis> its... kinda grandiose, really.

[19:02] *** kylese left
[19:03] <drakonis> given that you have more experience than i do with rakudo's internals, it should be viable to implement something like common lisp's restarts when debugging, right?

[19:04] <drakonis> its an awesome debugging experience

[19:05] <MasterDuke> well, i don't know cl, so don't know what restarts do to answer

[19:06] <drakonis> afaik rakudo already has it, but it doesnt have the debugger experience

[19:06] <drakonis> https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/error_handling.html

[19:06] <drakonis> from what i understand from raku's docs at least.

[19:09] <drakonis> its largely the debugger that seems to be missing here

[19:11] <MasterDuke> rakudo/moarvm does have a debugger, but it's not 100% polished. probably the best experience is using it in comma

[19:12] <MasterDuke> for that you'd want to talk to timo, i believe he's written almost all of it

[19:15] <drakonis> the nicest thing about it is that it pauses the execution and gives you options on how to handle the error

[19:17] <drakonis> you can even modify the environment at the time of execution and restart it with the modified environment

[19:18] <drakonis> fun fact: its done using MOP

[19:20] <[Coke]> anyone know how to use a userid with http::useragent? Don't see anything obvious in the docs.

[19:21] <MasterDuke> i've played with racket and clojure, but never cl

[19:22] <MasterDuke> and with those, never a large enough program that i'd need a debugger. i've read about what you can do with a scheme/lisp debugger, but never really experienced it firsthand

[19:22] <drakonis> CL is quite nice if you can get past the warts

[19:23] *** El_Che_ is now known as El_Che

[19:25] <drakonis> it is quite quite large and full of footguns though

[19:27] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[19:28] <drakonis> sadly.

[19:34] <MasterDuke> it seems like a language i think i would/should like, but don't, for no explainable reason, like scala

[19:47] <drakonis> hah.

[19:48] <drakonis> scala itself is very impenetrable

[19:57] <drakonis> it has oop and imperative programming but everyone only uses the fp side

[19:57] <drakonis> pure fp even

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's quite sad that you manage to get something out of these sentences you need to "interpret". The basic idea deserves more than this so I'm gonna recall it one more time

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> emacs vs vi was probably an interesting episode of IT pop culture but nowadays, presenting them as equals only holds for retro memes. This tells nothing about which one is better or which one anyone is ought to use, this is a neutral claim.

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Things just happened to turn in a way that vi and its descendants are what almost all nerdish guys know as "that legendary text editor from the 70's that is really cool for some reason" - while Emacs is something actual hardcores use, probably because they were taught by an old prof, or they are the old profs themselves.
