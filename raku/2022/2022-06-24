[02:24] <thowe> So, like, anyone here use things like fail2ban or Mailman (v2) or Postfix Admin?

[02:25] <thowe> Or am I just one of these weird old Sysadmin types from Perl 5 world?

[02:41] <Voldenet> fail2ban is great though

[02:47] <thowe> OK, yeah...  I have issues with it, but it doesn't have much decent competition.  I think a better alternative, that's newer, would be nice, and Raku is a great choice for making such a thing.  It would be useful; the language it's written in would be unimportant to it's main audience as long as it is easy to get and install for someone with no Raku knowledge.  Preferably just part of your OS  packages.  With a good website and docs.  Such things are one of the g

[02:47] <thowe> important for me would be Mailman; the v3 iteration really leaves the door open.

[02:49] <thowe> I really should bullet those points:  useful as a tool to people for whom the language is beside the point; easily deployed; actual web site with docs (showing it's maintained, etc...)  the current gen of a number of things are aging and leaving a gap.

[02:50] <thowe> i want to work on something like that, but I feel I need an interested mentor of sorts.

[02:50] <thowe> And I would be dogfooding it

[02:51] <thowe> mailman and fail2ban competitors would really scratch a couple itches for me

[02:55] <thowe> Anyway, got my useless opinion out.  as you were

[19:20] <lizmat> a 19 minute lightning talk ?   :-)

[19:21] <drakonis> its a 4 minutes talk

[19:21] <drakonis> well, this is a good one

[19:22] <perryprog> Or more accurately, Python only has about 2K questions?

[19:22] <drakonis> codesections: hoho

[19:22] <drakonis> this is good

[19:22] <drakonis> also isnt this basically how common lisp works?

[19:22] <lizmat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waHAGThlRH8 is 19 minutes for me?

[19:22] <drakonis> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1uBYBubNU

[19:22] <drakonis> this one

[19:23] <lizmat> ah, yes, that's a lightning talk :-)

[19:23] <drakonis> is there a list of lightning talks?

[19:23] <drakonis> its not in the website

[19:24] <lizmat> not yet, I guess... things are getting uploaded today and the coming days, I guess

[19:24] <drakonis> nailgun seems p. good and is basically how developing common lisp with slime/sly works like

[19:24] <drakonis> you have a running server that you can fire commands

[19:26] <lizmat> perryprog: I think it's actually 2M ?
