[11:58] <guifa> weird

[11:58] <guifa> I've got a class that I stub, but even though it's defined later on I get an error tat it's been stubbed but not defined

[12:00] <guifa> golfed

[12:00] <guifa> m: class A::B { class A::C { ... }; class A::C { has $.d } }

[12:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «The following packages were stubbed but not defined:␤    A::B::A::C␤»

[12:00] <guifa> any ideas what's going on?

[12:25] <lizmat> nope

[12:25] <moritz> bug is going on

[12:25] <moritz> m: class A::C { ... }; class A::C { has $.d }

[12:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[12:26] <moritz> ok, the outer thing is needed to reproduce

[12:26] <moritz> m: class Outer { class A::C { ... }; class A::C { has $.d } }

[12:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[12:26] <moritz> m: class Outer::Middle { class A::C { ... }; class A::C { has $.d } }

[12:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[12:26] <moritz> *and* it needs a name conflict between the As there

[12:26] <moritz> m: class Outer::Middle { class Outer::C { ... }; class Outer::C { has $.d } }

[12:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «The following packages were stubbed but not defined:␤    Outer::Middle::Outer::C␤»

[12:26] <moritz> fascinating

[12:28] <guifa> I can work around it fairly easily, thankfully, but if we agree it's buggy I'll file a report

[12:30] <lizmat> yea, please  :-)

[12:40] <guifa> and with that

[12:41] <guifa> my massive refactoring of Intl::CLDR (hitherto per gfldex's former calculations the biggest module by LOC) is complete

[12:41] * guifa does a happy dance

[12:41] <japhb> \o/

[12:41] <japhb> guifa++

[12:44] <guifa> although with the refactoring, I've probably shaved off 20-25% of code, so doubt I'm the LOC champ anymore

[13:29] <moritz> as the saying goes, lines of code is like mass of airplanes: nobody would build an aircraft with the goal to make it heavy :-) it just might need that much mass to do what it has to do

[13:35] <guifa> moritz fair. Some of my bestest modules are quite small.  Unfortunately, this is the  equivalent of the airplane factory and their equipment's factories used to produce the itsy bitsy modules :-)

[13:37] <guifa> I at least wrote a script to comment out the equipment's factories, and leave just the airplane factory in place to reduce memory overhead and dependencies a bit

[17:40] <Nemokosch> what? :DD

[17:42] *** Nemokosch left
[17:42] <guifa> mscha: that happens because the rule is that the wider type is used.  Since 1.76 is (I'm guessing you just watched Numberphile today) a Rat, the result is also a Rat.  Nemokosch has the way to tighten it back up to Int

[17:43] <mscha> guifa: I understand why it happens; it's just annoying that standard scientific notation of a number that is obviously an integer, is not an Int.

[17:44] <mscha> And yes, I watched Numberphile.  I tried (^1.76×10⁶⁷).pick but it hung.  (^176×10⁶⁵).pick is the easiest workaround.

[17:46] <gfldex> m: my $r := ^1.76×10⁶⁷;

[17:50] <mscha> m: say (1/((1/(1.76×10⁶⁷)).rand)).ceiling; # number that, according to Numberphile, nobody ever thought of.

[17:53] <gfldex> looks like .pick tries to turn that range into a list. A fairly large list.
