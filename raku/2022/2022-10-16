[10:11] <tellable6> arthur, I saw hi 2018-07-31T00:53:35Z in #perl6: <hi> how to compile libperl.a from perl source.

[10:12] <arthur> .tell tellable6 kick

[10:12] <tellable6> arthur, Thanks for the message

[10:14] <arthur> .tell arthur kick

[14:00] <tellable6> guifa_, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[14:00] <guifa_> to update the $*TZ variable

[14:39] <guifa_> how do you exit a react loop?  docs sort of say to use "done" but that seems to just turn off (lack of a better term) the whenever block, but doesn't exit the react block entirely

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> sounds interesting

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be good to see an example of what you mean

[14:44] <guifa_> Nemokosch: there might be a bit way of testing supplies, but I figured the best way is to make the test file look like how people would use it

[14:44] <guifa_> so I have

[14:44] <tellable6> guifa_, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[14:45] <guifa_> react { whenever minute-shifts() { do-tests and exit-react } }; done-testing()

[14:46] <guifa_> although the question is now more theoretical.  I realized that if something goes wrong, that test will NEVER END.  So I now have `start react { ... }; sleep $expected-time; ok $event-called; done-testing`

[14:46] <guifa_> where event-called is set to true when the event is called
