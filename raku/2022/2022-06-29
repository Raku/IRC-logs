[11:55] <patrickb> You can retrieve the key from https://rakudo.org/keys/rakudo_github_automation-3E7E3C6EAF916676AC549285A2919382E961E2EE.asc

[11:55] <MitarashiDango[m> Gotcha, thanks for letting me know!

[12:09] <patrickb> Ah, you mean using rakubrew instead of the binaries from rakudo.org? Well.... rakubrew downloads and uses those exact binaries. :-P

[15:56] * [Coke] checks current status of SSL on a slightly older mac

[15:58] *** stevied joined
[15:59] <stevied> this thing on?

[16:00] <stevied> can someone take a look at https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/issues/606

[16:02] <stevied> I think a bunch of modules are not getting updated in the ecosystem. could be wrong on this but that's what it looks like to me.

[16:02] <ugexe> git:// is deprecated on github afaik

[16:02] <ugexe> so any modules using git:// for github source urls should switch to https://

[16:03] <stevied> so this can be corrected by the module author?

[16:03] *** discord-raku-bot left
[16:03] <ugexe> if im correct, then yes

[16:03] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[16:03] <ugexe> rather if im correct that this is the reason for the error shown

[16:04] <stevied> that's a crap load of modules not getting updated.

[16:06] <ugexe> a good reason to only use dependencies that are actively updated

[16:06] <ugexe> or at least have an active author

[16:11] <stevied> well, the module I wanted to install was updated 2 weeks ago

[16:11] <stevied> it's still showing 3.7.3 as the last version but currrent version on github is 3.7.5

[16:11] <ugexe> the other thing is its giving a 401 error

[16:11] <ugexe> so maybe the ecosystems token is expired or something?

[16:11] <stevied> so this seems to be an ongoing problem

[16:12] <stevied> that is what I was thinking it was, yes

[16:13] <stevied> this is why I think this is a fairly urgent issues and should probably be escalated

[16:13] <ugexe> ah yeah its happening for every dist... for some reason i thought it wasnt

[16:13] <stevied> I don't know what person handles that

[16:13] <ugexe> zef doesn't use that ecosystem though

[16:14] <ugexe> or rather its generated elsewhere

[16:14] <stevied> I don't know anything about that but zef keeps trying to install version 3.7.3 when latest version is 3.7.5

[16:14] <ugexe> well maybe not... it uses REA now which I dunno what that is based on

[16:14] <stevied> so zef seems to be impacted

[16:16] <stevied> so how do we figure out who the point person is on this?

[16:17] *** Altai-man joined
[16:17] *** sena_kun left
[16:17] <ugexe> zef is on version 0.13.8

[16:18] <stevied> correct. see https://github.com/finanalyst/raku-pod-render/issues/11#issuecomment-1170020548

[16:20] <ugexe> https://github.com/Raku/REA/tree/main/meta/R/Raku::Pod::Render

[16:20] <ugexe> that doesnt have 3.7.5

[16:21] <stevied> I know it doesn't. because it's stuck at 3.7.3

[16:21] <stevied> it's not getting updated

[16:21] <ugexe> my p6c ecosystem scraper isnt having any problems, but we voted to replace it with rea -- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/master/p6c1.json

[16:22] <patrickb> ping lizmat: Is there something wrong with gh access in REA?

[16:22] <stevied> I don't know what that means. All I know is that when I do `zef install Raku::Pod::Render it tries to install 3.7.3

[16:23] <patrickb> stevied: Thanks for actively getting this problem noticed. 

[16:23] <stevied> Raku::Pod::Render does have this for the source-url in META6: `source-url: https://github.com/sdondley/MenuSimple.git`

[16:23] <ugexe> you could pass it --/rea to potentially work around it until rea itself is fixed

[16:23] <stevied> oops, wrong module. shit. let me fix

[16:24] <stevied> it has this: `source-url: git://github.com/finanalyst/raku-pod-render.git`

[16:24] <ugexe> er, --/rea --p6c

[16:24] <stevied> so it's using the git protocol

[16:25] *** morte_ left
[16:26] <patrickb> iirc git:// access has been completely disabled on GH.

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> rings a bell

[16:28] <ugexe> i think its using the github web api, and only using the source-url to construct the https github api url itself

[16:28] <patrickb> ugexe do you know off hand whether there is any s/^git/https/ going on in the p6c eco? (which rea possibly misses)

[16:28] <ugexe> none

[16:29] <ugexe> the github api is giving a 401 error, which suggests the token being used is expired or invalid now

[16:29] <patrickb> ugexe: what does "it" refer to?

[16:29] <ugexe> https://modules.raku.org/update.log

[16:30] <ugexe> and im presuming REA is using modules.raku.org to get its list

[16:30] <patrickb> ah. So the got URL thing is a wrong lead

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> from what I can tell, all 1400 or so modules are failing

[17:02] *** Altai-man left
[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> actually, 2001 modules looks like

[17:03] <patrickb> At least it's consistent. So to sum up: modules.raku.org and REA fail to update their databases. AFAICS raku.land is good.

[17:04] <patrickb> I guess lizmat will deal with REA (that's what zef uses).

[17:05] <patrickb> But then I think modules.raku.org is currently maintainerless / community maintained.

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, I think any module uploaded directly to raku.land and not using pf6 is good

[17:07] <patrickb> Both raku.land and modules.raku.org are only providing a website for browsing modules. Neither of the two are the basis of any installers.

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, I was going to say, https://raku.land/github:finanalyst/Raku::Pod::Render is showing 3.7.5 but zef doesn't knot it exists

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, I was going to say, https://raku.land/github:finanalyst/Raku::Pod::Render is showing 3.7.5 but zef doesn't know it exists

[17:09] <patrickb> Also both raku.land and modules.raku.org display modules in all three of our three ecos (p6c, cpan, fez)

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i don't know enough about what happens under the hood to know why

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'll let you all figure out the REA thingy, whatever that is

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> modules.raku.org shows version 3.7.3, iirc

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, says "last updated on 2022-01-01. this is wrong

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it was updated 2 weeks ago

[20:51] <guifa> how can you check if a method is proto?

[20:53] <guifa> I would have thought .onlystar or something but even for an actual onlystar proto it doesn't work

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> just found some other really weird ecosystem weirdness. When I do `zef install Pod::To::HTML` it tries to install Raku::Pod::Render. I have to do `zef install Pod::To::HTML:auth<github::Raku` to get the proper module

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this is on a totally clean docker image

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so how does this happen? someone should probably look into this as well. I'll file an issue.

[22:19] <SmokeMachine> I've been rethinking on how the syntax to grammar for event patterns should be. (I have no idea on how to do that yet, but...). Could someone see if any of this (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage/tree/master/mindstorm) make sense? And if someone have any suggestion

[22:23] <lizmat> patrickb: fwiw. looks like the REA has a 3.7.6 and no 3.7.4 or 3.7.5

[22:23] <guifa> SmokeMachine I actually updated the BASIC test module, it now allows for standalone subs in addition to methods (although your pattern stuff really just requires methods, I think

[22:23] <lizmat> this *could* be the result of updates on Github while the REA harvester was out

[22:24] <lizmat> also: the 3.7.6 is on zef

[22:24] <guifa> SmokeMachine I'll actually be posting a real world useful module soon based off of a discussion I had at TPRC

[22:24] <guifa> (if you saw my LT, you'll already know what's coming haha)

[22:24] <stevied> lizmat, the author of the R::P::R module just updated his module to work with zef about an hour ago

[22:25] <lizmat> hmm..  I guess... but I don't think I like the way it was done  :-)

[22:25] <lizmat> anyways, it's late for me... I'll look at getting 3.7.4 and 3.7.5 out of the git repo into the REA

[22:25] <stevied> See https://github.com/finanalyst/raku-pod-render/issues/11#issuecomment-1170517058

[22:26] <stevied> but what about the 401 errors for all the other modules? aren't those also a problem?

[22:26] <lizmat> and indeed.. people should move from the git ecosystem to zef  :-

[22:26] <lizmat> )

[22:28] <SmokeMachine> guifa: I did watch, but I confess I don't remember about any new module, could you say something about it?

[22:28] <guifa> haha it was more of a hint

[22:28] *** sena_kun left
[22:29] <guifa> I'm doing JavaScript regex syntax and compiling it via AST

[22:30] <guifa> so instead of regex foo {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}¬†you can do ecma-regex foo {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}¬†and it will just work (I've got to figure out spacing though, since it's significant in ECMA and that just sucks if you want the brackets on different lines lol 

[22:30] <SmokeMachine> guifa: Oh! Now I remember about that being said... :

[22:30] <guifa> the goal will be to make a module with the various flavors of regex syntax

[22:30] <guifa> so you could also do posix-regex {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}¬†or python-regex {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}¬†etc etc

[22:31] <SmokeMachine> good idea! are you going to implement p5 regex swell?

[22:31] <guifa> I think that would be pretty easy since we already have P5 option yeah?

[22:31] <SmokeMachine> wasn't it removed?

[22:32] <guifa> it's still in the docs

[22:33] <SmokeMachine> I can be misremembering...

[22:33] <guifa> m: 'aaa' ~~ m:Perl5/(a)*/

[22:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7cf264572: ( no output )

[22:33] <guifa> m: say 'aaa' ~~ m:Perl5/(a)*/

[22:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7cf264572: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢aaaÔΩ£‚ê§ 0 => ÔΩ¢aÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[22:33] <guifa> yeah, that modifier is still there

[22:34] * guifa . o O ( note to self: implement m:ecma/‚Ä¶/ as well )

[22:35] <SmokeMachine> I think I was thinking about this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2624

[22:38] <SmokeMachine> any opinion/suggestion about the "event". syntax?

[22:40] <guifa> SmokeMachine I'd need to take a closer look at it to give you better feedback.  If it's not urgent, please pester me next week when I'll be sitting around very bored most of the day :-)

[22:41] <SmokeMachine> guifa: not urgent at all! I'll sent it to you next week then. Are you going on a vacation?

[22:42] <guifa> I wish haha, but am traveling more than I care to for the next few days
