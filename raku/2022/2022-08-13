[11:04] <SmokeMachine> Is there already a link for the Raku conference?

[11:07] <tbrowder> g'day. visiting IO::Path again, it seems unfinished that IO::Path.parent has no terminator. that is to say that, for a real file $f with no more than 10 parents will give the same result with $f.IO.parent(100).

[11:08] <lizmat> m: dd "/".IO.parent   # hmmm....

[11:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10feda116: OUTPUT: «IO::Path.new("/", :SPEC(IO::Spec::Unix), :CWD("/home/camelia"))␤»

[11:09] <lizmat> tbrowder: so you'd argue that should probably create a Failure ?

[11:11] <tbrowder> or do something. i would like to see something like this to return the "top" parent IO::Path.parent(*)

[11:12] <tbrowder> and make IO::Path.parents return a number

[11:12] <tbrowder> of parents

[11:12] <Voldenet> I agree with the .IO.parent point

[11:12] <Voldenet> giving "/" to a script is an edge case otherwise

[11:13] <tbrowder> exactly

[11:13] <tbrowder> right now i have to test for "/" at every step

[11:14] <Voldenet> right now my scripts don't even support that properly, because I know to not run them in root

[11:14] <Voldenet> which isn't exactly elegant convention

[11:15] <tbrowder> anyhow, i know lizmat, coke, and vrurg can come up with an elegant solution

[11:17] <tbrowder> what time is raku conf kickoff?

[12:15] <lizmat> tbrowder: the problem with IO::Path.top is that on Windows, there is not a single top

[12:15] <lizmat> C:\  and D:\ would both be top, no ?

[12:16] <lizmat> I'd rather see a method "is-top" on an IO::Path that would return a Bool indicating there's no more parents

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> +1 for a link for the conference...

[12:25] <Voldenet> I'm not sure if uniform path handling is going to ever work well on windows

[12:25] <Voldenet> for example `raku -e $*CWD.IO.dir.say` on windows can fail easily

[12:26] <tbrowder> lizmat: that would work for me

[12:27] *** deoac joined
[12:27] <Voldenet> which happens when $*CWD is unc path

[12:27] <Voldenet> on win2003 \\?… is correct unc path, on vista+ it isn't

[12:28] <tbrowder> well Windows people should pick a better OS!  ;-D

[12:28] <Voldenet> I wish windows was more unix like, eh

[12:29] <tbrowder> you bet!

[12:31] <tbrowder> lizmat: how about the IO::Path.parents method retuning number of parents (counting is-top)?

[12:33] <Voldenet> imo msys2 does the right thing: /c/whatever becomes `c:\whatever` and `//whatever/test` becomes `\\whatever\test`

[12:33] <lizmat> so that $io.parents.tail would give yu top ?

[12:45] <Voldenet> imo .parents.tail should return '/' on unix and 'drive:' or '\\servername'

[12:46] <lizmat> not drive:\ ?

[12:47] <lizmat> I thought drive: implied current directory on that drive Voldenet  ?

[12:47] <Voldenet> you can do `dir c:`

[12:49] <Voldenet> it's somehow weirder for UNC paths

[12:49] <Voldenet> because in most tools \\servername is not a proper root

[12:50] <Voldenet> you can't `ls \\server`, `ls \\server\path` is valid

[12:50] <tbrowder> if we’re looking at a parent dir, what about getting children? (without File::Find)?

[12:52] <Voldenet> .dir(:recursive)?

[12:53] <tbrowder> sorry just first generation :~)

[12:54] <Voldenet> continuing the above, on msys2 bash I can just `ls //server`, which is totally weird, but consistent

[12:54] <tbrowder> or specify depth of search

[12:55] <tbrowder> file child vs dir child

[12:55] <Voldenet> (in powershell you need `net view \\server` which is a few more layers of weird)

[12:56] <tbrowder> hm, looking like good parts of File::Find!

[12:59] <tbrowder> one of my fav modules

[13:12] <Voldenet> I've thought about it and drive:\ is more sane

[13:27] *** linkable6 left
[13:28] *** linkable6 joined
[13:29] *** evalable6 joined
[13:30] <Voldenet> either way, probably more difficult issue is properly handling unc paths, because there's no good default on whether "\\whatever\" should be included as top parent or not

[14:33] <[Coke]> "on vista+ it isn't" - do we need to be supporting vista with even code examples at this point?

[14:38] <Voldenet> I'm not sure what is supported when you run raku in compatibility mode on windows, but probably not

[14:38] <Voldenet> (vista+ is the current state though)

[14:39] <Voldenet> (win2003 is still in use, but unsupported)

[14:43] <[Coke]> sorry, how to run raku in compatibility mode?

[14:43] <[Coke]> I am just... running it.

[14:44] <[Coke]> ah. You can manually choose to run something in compatibility mode - but why would you do that?

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it only goes to Vista anyway

[14:44] <[Coke]> That sounds like a DIHWIDT.

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> on Windows 10

[14:48] <Voldenet> either way, I have not seen \\?-style paths in a while

[14:52] <[Coke]> +1

[14:54] <[Coke]> ... dammit. :)

[14:55] <Voldenet> I've checked and .net doesn't support that

[15:02] <lizmat> The 2nd Raku Conference has started!   https://conf.raku.org

[15:04] <Voldenet> til perl6 is not a symlink to raku

[15:34] <ugexe> \\? style paths are used internally at the libuv level

[15:35] <ugexe> which allows long paths to be used

[17:26] <ingy> https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/ lists `perl6`

[17:26] <ingy> someone should PR that

[17:27] <lizmat> where would that need to be PRed ?
