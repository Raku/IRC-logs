[14:51] <japhb> Are you using one of the line editors?  I dunno if there are any that would contribute to steady-state CPU usage, but I can imagine it.  The other thing is that the scheduler, telemetry, or other background task may be taking up some CPU.
[15:17] *** irc_user joined
[15:19] <Juerd> How do I find out?
[15:36] <japhb> Juerd: To see what line editor you're using, you can try:
[15:36] <japhb> $ raku -e 'use nqp; say REPL.new(nqp::getcomp("Raku"), {}, True).WHAT'
[15:36] <japhb> (REPL+{TerminalLineEditorBehavior[Stash]})
[15:37] <japhb> As for the others, lizmat++ probably knows better what all is going on in the background of a default REPL.
[15:37] <Juerd> (REPL+{ReadlineBehavior[Stash]})
[15:37] <japhb> OK, so you're using classic Readline.
[15:38] <Juerd> Yes, Linenoise gets on my nerves like nothing else :)
[15:38] <japhb> Ditto.  Hence the reason I wrote Terminal::LineEditor.  ;-)
[15:39] <Juerd> How does one switch between these?
[15:40] <Juerd> Nevermind, found the doc :)
[15:41] <Juerd> Similarly getting on my nerves, by not showing the entire input over multiple lines after reaching the end
[15:41] <Juerd> Call me old fashioned but I like the way every CLI has always worked... :)
[15:42] <japhb> Juerd: Am I understanding correctly that you're wanting a non-scrolling line editor?
[15:43] <Juerd> Yes :)
[15:44] <japhb> I wrote the first version of T::LE with certain TUI use cases in mind, and using it for a CLI is admittedly putting in oval block into a circular hole.  :-)
[15:44] <Juerd> I can understand the need for scrolling line editors in full screen things like IRC clients (although I've set my irssi to automatically grow the input bar to multiple lines if needed.)
[15:44] <Juerd> https://juerd.nl/i/cfdcdf4105895141f17040c3e71459c8.png
[15:45] <Juerd> Even for TUI uses, a vertically growing bar helps to keep track of one's thoughts
[15:45] <Juerd> Although not every UI will have space for it
[15:45] <Juerd> Oh, when I said irssi, I meant weechat. Irssi doesn't support this (afaik)
[15:46] <japhb> Ah, interesting.  Well, multi-line certainly can go in the next version.  I need to write a text area implementation for the TUI stuff anyway.  :-)
[15:46] <japhb> Care to create a GitHub issue with your desired behaviors (and any configurables you'd like to have)?
[15:49] <japhb> Oh, I checked the scheduler.  By default it wakes up every 10ms to self-tune (determine if more threads are needed, for instance).  That's probably enough that top would see it as 1% CPU usage.
[15:55] <Juerd> No, sorry, I'm not currently interested in doing much more than chatting on irc a little. I'm exhausted and am trying not to get involved in things.
