[09:35] <younder> Do you use the comma editor?

[09:36] <younder> It seems better than the Emacs mode and  the Visual studio code mode.  They need the intellisense completion of comma.

[09:36] <younder> Of course there is vim..

[09:40] <younder> Been working on the emacs mode. Prettify allows unicode charactes to be substituded for op+erators which also incedentally alers you if our combo  needs a space so it is not interprented as a operator.

[09:41] <younder> s/alers/alerts/

[09:46] <younder> Not sure how to do the intellisense though. Perhaps I'll take some of the experience from SLIME. (Superrior Lisp Interaction Mode). Anyhow I will need a running interprenter to import modules and see their export functions.

[09:47] * lizmat forgot to clickbait https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/01/17/2022-03-rakucon-how/ yesterday

[09:56] <younder> I had a problem reading /usr/share/ispell/amarican.. dictionary. It seems it is written in latin1! '@DICTIONARY = $DictionaryFile.IO.lines silenly returns an empty list. You need to add (enc => "latin1") to the end. Seriosly annoying! It to me hours to figure out. Perhaps something for rakudo to look at.

[09:57] <lizmat> that feels....  weird

[09:58] <lizmat> could you run: dd $DictionaryFile.IO.lines without the enc and tell me what that says ?

[10:00] <younder> dd @DICIONARY; returns @DICTIONARY = []

[10:00] <younder> no error

[10:02] <lizmat> I want to see what $DictionaryFile.IO.lines  returns, *not* what is in @DICTIONARY

[10:06] <younder> but @DICTIONARY = $DictionaryFile.IO.lines

[10:06] <younder> shouldn't they be the same?

[10:08] <younder> It sais Malformed utf8 near bytes 62 e9 2f

[10:17] <lizmat> ok, so I guess the problem is that .lines returns a Failure, and it should probably throw

[10:17] <younder> I found french accents in the american dictionary. The reason for the problem. An yes an exception would help.

[10:19] <lizmat> could you please make an issue for that?  I don't have time to look at it now, and am afraid it will fall through the cracks otherwise

[10:19] <lizmat> also: please include (a part) of the file that causes the issue

[10:21] <younder> Will do.. This sort of thing turns peaple away from raku. And the language deserves better!

[11:24] <elcaro_> FWIW, I can't get a latin-1 file read to somehow result in an empty array like younder reported

[11:25] <elcaro_> obv. I can assign `.lines` to a scalar - which is lazy - but the Failure always bubbles up eventually.

[11:25] *** elcaro_ is now known as elcaro

[11:25] <lizmat> with "foo".IO.lines -> @array {

[11:25] <lizmat> would silently eat the Failure

[11:27] <elcaro> ahh, it's a bad choice to use `with` there. I'm generally more careful with my use of `with`. I feel like some people use it in place of `given` without realising the difference

[11:28] <elcaro> it's a bit of a newbie trap, so maybe throwing on malformed utf8 is not a bad idea

[11:29] <elcaro> lizmat: hmm, even using `with`, the failure still bubbles up as soon as I do anything with the `@array`

[11:30] <lizmat> hmmm...  ok

[11:32] <elcaro> will wait to see if the issue gets raised

[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, I don't know why people use with over given, when they don't reason about the value to topicalize being Nil
