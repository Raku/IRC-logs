[08:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar f71ada59a: ( no output )

[08:13] <suman> Is there a way to test if the giveb list is all composed  of integers or num or rat ?

[08:22] <MasterDuke> m: my @a = [1,2e2,3.3]; say all(@a) ~~ Numeric; my @b = [1,2e2,3.3,"str"]; say all(@b) ~~ Numeric;

[08:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar f71ada59a: OUTPUT: «True␤False␤»

[08:33] <suman> MasterDuke my goal is to test if the list is made of ints or num, accordingly i can pass the list/array to nativecall. If I test individual items then it would be O(n). can it be done in O(1) time.

[08:34] <MasterDuke> sort of

[08:35] <MasterDuke> m: my int @a = 1,2; say @a.of

[08:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar f71ada59a: OUTPUT: «(int)␤»

[08:37] <MasterDuke> if the array is parameterized, you can check what it was parameterized as with `.of`. if it isn't parameterized, but you just want to check that all the elements are ok, you're pretty much stuck at O(n)

[08:39] <MasterDuke> m: sub foo(@a) { say @a.of; say @a }; foo([1, 2]); my int @n = 2,3; foo(@n)

[08:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar f71ada59a: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤[1 2]␤(int)␤[2 3]␤»

[14:48] <[Coke]> good tutorial on Raku OO? I am trying to follow the BUILD/TWEAK examples for a simple class and passing in an attribute in the constructor doesn't seem to be working.

[14:49] <[Coke]> AHAHAHA. because I'm an idiot.

[14:49] <[Coke]> nevermind. :)

[14:57] <[Coke]> ... crud. the powershell command to get the window size seems to be reporting on it as if it were a brand new powershell, not whatever the current terminal (in my case, a git bash terminal) is

[14:59] <[Coke]> works just fine if my terminal is already a powershell, unsurprisingly.

[15:00] <vrurg_> [Coke]: $COLUMNS?

[15:00] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[15:01] <vrurg> %*ENV<COLUMNS> I mean. :)

[15:05] <[Coke]> doesn't exist on windows

[15:07] <[Coke]> best I've found is: powershell -command '&{(get-host)).ui.rawui.WindowSize;}'

[15:18] *** razetime joined
[15:22] <[Coke]> ah, tput works on git bash

[16:11] <[Coke]> docs.raku.org/language/concurrency#Locks - This example is unlikely to trigger the issue the lock is protecting against. should make it ^1000 and remove the sleep, yes?

[18:41] <Voldenet> [Coke]: you can get columns in powershell using nativecall

[18:43] *** _ed joined
[18:51] <Voldenet> i've skipped the error handling, but basically GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo returns 0 on fail, so there's nothing much in it

[19:38] <vrurg> [Coke]: Sorry, I was away. I know Win doesn't have $COLUMNS, but as long as you mentioned bash I thought it does it for user.

[19:41] <[Coke]> git bash doesn't, no

[19:42] <[Coke]> tmux is fine. I assume that your solution is using the same as my powershell call, which would return the wrong numbers.

[19:42] <[Coke]> and it's got the advantage of being less code.

[19:42] <[Coke]> unfortunately, while my standalone version of the viewport worked, it looks like it's not working when I try to integrate it with actual code. blah.
