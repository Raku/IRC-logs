[01:32] <avuserow> I recently rediscovered devdocs dot io, a site that combines documentation from various sources and has a nice offline mode. I'd like to suggest they include Raku's docs but they want at least 5000 stars on github. Can folks please go and star https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo so we can try to get included?

[19:58] <wolfshield> I am trying to zef install Inline::Perl5 in the Rakudo-star 2021.04 docker and get the error "[Inline::Perl5] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl" -- does anyone have suggestions?

[20:03] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> have you added perl:latest to your docker image?

[20:04] *** sena_kun joined
[20:04] <[Coke]> https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5#building

[20:05] <[Coke]> You need a recent enough p5 with a specific config option enabled.

[20:05] <wolfshield> no, thought that would have been included in the Rakudo-start docker, will try explicilty adding perl:latest, thank you

[20:12] <wolfshield> it appears the rakudo-star 2021.04 docker comes with perl 5.28.2, built with --useshrplib. That should be recent enough and built with the right config options, no?

[20:13] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> aye it should

[20:17] <[Coke]> can I create a zef config that will always skip REA?

[20:17] <[Coke]> so I have to explicitly add it on the command line?

[20:17] <[Coke]> (er, add it if I want it)

[20:41] <[Coke]> I have an app with multiple mains. What's the easiest way to have a standard set of options that I can easily make available to each MAIN? Can I put some :$foos in a proto?

[20:44] * [Coke] supposes he should look at zef.

[20:50] <japhb> [Coke]: See https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-CLI/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/CLI.rakumod#L360 for how I've been doing common MAIN options.

[20:52] <[Coke]> nifty, thanks

[21:02] <[Coke]> japhb++ incorporated

[21:08] <lucs> [Coke]: Is zoffix involved with Raku again?

[21:09] <lucs> (that is, why the "++"?)

[21:09] <[Coke]> there was a PR which looks like it was opened very recently

[21:10] <lucs> Ah, cool.
