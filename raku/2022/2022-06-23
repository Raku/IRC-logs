[05:00] <guifa> tonyo: ha, I don't need it done, but am finishing up my talk on making modules

[05:00] *** Sankalp- joined
[05:00] <guifa> ended up being more thinking about designing modules wit a little bit on fez at the end (leaving y'all plenty of space to get into technical nitty gritty about it for other talks/conferences) but wanted to be prepped for any questions

[05:01] <tonyo> at the moment it's just a PM transaction - no api for it yet but can add it to the list

[05:01] <tonyo> will it be online? i'd give it a listen

[05:07] <guifa> tonyo will be recorded, but not hybrid

[05:07] <guifa> Looking back I've  noticed I have a tendency to push people to make good modules

[05:08] <guifa> (obvs subjective a bit, but wanting people to think a bit about how people use modules, at least)

[05:10] <tonyo> are you advocating pinning module versions in usage?

[11:00] <andinus> in https://marketing.raku.org/id/1531801752/img is there a reason `use WWW` is inside of submethod TWEAK?

[11:08] <lizmat> andinus: because use statements are lexical?  to prevent poisoning the outer scope with unnecessary exports ?

[11:09] <lizmat> m: sub ok(|) { say "this ok" }; { use Test; ok "foo" }; ok "bar"

[11:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7d8e9d0f: OUTPUT: ¬´ok 1 - ‚ê§this ok‚ê§¬ª

[11:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is 6.c, c for "christmas" a sort of inside joke originally?

[11:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in other words, which was first

[11:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the "is it christmas yet" mocking, or the name for the version?

[11:11] <lizmat> you'd have to ask Larry

[11:12] <lizmat> he came up with the versioning, but yeah: afaik, the "c" is for Christmas, I think the mocking was first

[11:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> üòÖ

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what will be the name of the e version?

[11:18] <[Coke]> Under discussion, last I checked

[11:18] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/254

[11:19] <lizmat> I think the consensus is that there will be a 6.e (perhaps Eventually :-), but that versioning after that is still undecided

[12:09] *** reportable6 joined
[12:25] <[Coke]> I would vote against Easter. We already had Christmas.

[12:26] <[Coke]> I have seen Epiphany (but in Spanish), Easter, and Eid suggested.

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Well you were the one who wrote that under the issue as well, no?

[12:28] <SmokeMachine> I would also vote against Easter for the same reason...

[12:29] *** fingolfin joined
[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I also have mixed feelings about easter. But it could be named just Egg ü§£

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> "Easter" would kinda seem like "hah, they don't see past their own shit"

[12:34] <Xliff> Well, gee.

[12:34] <Voldenet> it would be fun idea to name 6.e "everlasting" and never release another one

[12:35] <Xliff> Voldenet: Noooo! I haz plans for 6.f!

[12:35] <Voldenet> :>

[12:35] <Xliff> Fly, fly away!

[12:35] <Voldenet> "ethereal" then

[12:35] <Xliff> (would mix well with the butterfly theme...)

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> flutterby!

[12:38] <Xliff> LOL! ü§£

[12:38] <Voldenet> I see 6.f ideas are better, so maybe call 6.e evicted and release 6.f instead ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ~~like Perl 6~~

[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Found it -- "Text::Chart". (Initially I was searching into raku.land with "plot".)

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's nice where raku.land has gotten

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hmm... raku.land has to be endowed with certain semantic search capabilities.

[16:00] <tonyo> depends on what side you're on, on the upload side you must have a valid dist 

[16:00] <tonyo> with no wildcard version

[16:00] <tonyo> (cpan and git both allow wildcard anything)

[18:12] <ugexe> the language itself just requires a bare minimum of 'name' i think (i.e. what items of META6.json *must* be provided for CURs to be able to use them), although practically it also requires that `provides` be correct if you want to install modules

[18:14] <ugexe> the language itself doesn't understand e.g. `depends`, although various raku tools would require it

[18:17] <ugexe> "name, auth, version, provides" is a good bare minimum

[18:18] <ugexe> like technically auth and version aren't needed, but it would be easier for everyone if they are used that way

[20:29] <Voldenet> I guess that is easy to explain - having them as methods is better code style

[20:30] <Voldenet> it seems that a lot of routines exist because of perl5 familiarity

[20:32] <Voldenet> like pop, shift, push, unshift

[20:34] <Voldenet> but if you look at the implementation (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/db074a8/src/core.c/array_operators.pm6), those routines just use methods

[20:42] <p6steve> isnt' there a way to apply a method as a sub?

[20:42] <p6steve> kind of methodop inverse

[20:59] *** discord-raku-bot left
[20:59] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> doubtful

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, don't underestimate the worth of having head as a sub

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 1000 .. * ==> grep &is-prime => head 2

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 1000 .. * ==> grep &is-prime ==> head 2

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this fails on the lack of the sub head

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it wouldn't be bad style, not at all

[21:24] <lizmat> I guess the same for tail and skip then?

[21:26] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat I experimented with "App::Rak" a little. Do you think it is a good idea to have the options `--must=<rx>` , `--must-not=<rx>`, `--inverted`  or that is too far away from the style you prefer for that package?

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> lizmat: yes, preferably

[22:23] <Xliff> Please do not remove .head, .tail and .skip
