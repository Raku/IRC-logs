[12:42] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to guifa_

[12:42] <tbrowder> bye for now..

[12:43] <guifa_> tbrowder nope.  My multilanguage stuff is all under Intl:: (in this case, Intl::DateTime::Format)

[12:47] <guifa_> lizmat ask and you shall receive ... I'll see if I can get it added today once I get moving

[12:47] <lizmat> :-)

[12:48] <guifa_> I've got to update ZoneInfo anyways, there was an update for timezone data, but it's mainly long term future so I hadn't been in a rush

[12:54] <guifa_> oh sweet

[13:18] <andinus> how would raku.land handle a module published by 2 different authors?

[13:19] *** linkable6 left
[13:19] <andinus> say "zef:abc" publishes v0.1.0 and "zef:xyz" publishes v0.2.0

[13:19] <lizmat> if you don't specify an auth, it will take the highest version

[13:20] <lizmat> if the versions tie, it will take the highest api version, afaik

[13:20] <andinus> i see, iirc that is true for zef cli

[13:20] <andinus> does it show up as same module on raku.land ?

[13:21] *** linkable6 joined
[13:21] <lizmat> andinus: there's a #raku-land channel   :-)

[13:27] <guifa_> lizmat: halp with naming. "timezones-set" sounds to me like it's gonna set a timezone lol, "timezones-map"....well, yeah bad for similar reasons.  timezone-list = not accurate, since I'm returning a Set 

[13:27] <andinus> Nemokosch: ah i see

[13:27] <tellable6> andinus, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[13:28] <andinus> in your case the author is same, i guess i'll try doing this sometime later

[13:28] <guifa_> oof so verbose though

[13:28] <lizmat> well... how often will you call it  in your code?

[13:28] * guifa_ holds up mirror 

[13:29] <lizmat> if not often, a long name doesn't matter as much and clarity gains

[13:29] <guifa_> I dunno, how often will you call it lizmat?

[16:15] *** jgaz joined
[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> El_Che: that there are 3 additional sigils that cannot be conceptually mapped to variables of other languages

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and there are separate assignment mechanisms for them, while what I would consider _the assignment_ is called "item assignment"

[16:22] *** jgaz left
[16:27] <El_Che> you mean . and ! ?

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Nope. I don't use much OO in Raku anyway, truth be told

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> @, % and one of \ and $, depending the mental framework (I'd say the third one is \ )

[17:13] <El_Che> a kind of container typinh

[17:13] <El_Che> g

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not sure how it is in Perl but in Raku, sigils don't really affect the type but the "variable interface" itself (that's what containers are for)

[17:15] *** Colere left
[17:15] <El_Che> you do of course what do you thing it's best, but I think it will confuse people

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think containers confuse people already üòÖ

[17:17] <El_Che> not if they learnt bash first

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 1. I don't think many people "learn Bash first"

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 2. Bash (and POSIX shell in general) is like the only language I have ever found absolutely horrible

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I would go as far as to say, Perl's existence is justified by the horror POSIX shells are

[17:21] <tonyo> if you think the "language" is horrible then you either dont understand the problem they solved or never grew up with cli only computer

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I definitely never grew up with cli only computer üôÇ

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> But anyway, if shell was just half decent, I wouldn't have started Raku at all

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the Perl family proves that it can be done with actual types, control structures, scopes etc

[20:00] <tonyo> it's always worth thinking about why something is the way it is and its merit for what it made simpler because those reasons always come around again, the shell simplified how we interact with computers in a very big way.  it was designed to be that type of language, not one with "correctness" or strict-ness, or even types

[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think it's even more worth thinking about what lead to the creation of Perl, Tcl, Python and several other languages, among the number of different shell implementations with ad-hoc additional features (Bash for example striving for a more C-ish look, with better conditionals and loops), and what we think about interacting with a complex system now

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What does bash have to do with containers, by the way? Bash was brought up with regards to Raku containers.

[20:29] <guifa_> tony-o ugexe I'm getting a "Meta error: "auth" must be zef:" message when uploading with fez, but my auth definitely has "zef:guifa".  Any ideas?

[20:32] <tonyo> guifa_: it might be using the git bundling - which uses what's in the branch cache and not on disk

[20:32] <tonyo> so, if you have it pushed upstream as one thing and locally as another, it'll cause what you're seeing - i'm working on fixing that
