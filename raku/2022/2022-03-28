[20:57] <drakonis> hmm, geth...

[20:57] <drakonis> is this a mass effect reference?

[20:58] <moritz> I geth so

[20:59] <drakonis> by the way, is there any way to produce a binary or save the state of a running instance of rakudo into a file to load later?

[21:00] <drakonis> save it into an image

[21:01] <Geth> ¦ App-Rakubrew: 9aab76d288 | (Patrick Böker)++ | 4 files

[21:08] <japhb> drakonis: That's an XY question (a possible solution to a problem, but not actually a statement of the underlying problem).  What problem are you trying to solve?

[21:08] <guifa> drakonis not afaik.  At best the work codesections on persistent data, but I don't know how far it'll go.  You could probably come up with some neat traits that handle much of what you'd want to do

[21:09] <drakonis> my problem is that i want to evaluate raku code inside another host

[21:09] <drakonis> basically, i want to deploy raku code to execute changes on a target

[21:09] <drakonis> i've seen this done with consfigurator, which uses common lisp

[21:10] <drakonis> all you need is the same CL implementation on the target and it'll execute the code there

[21:11] <japhb> One of our GSOC folks got partway to being able to package MoarVM and all the Rakudo stuff into a single binary, but that summer ended before getting all the way complete, and we've not had anyone pick that up since.

[21:11] <drakonis> huh, interesting.

[21:11] <drakonis> is raku on gsoc this year?

[21:11] <drakonis> although i don't think i'd be able to participate due to my lack of experience

[21:13] <japhb> Certainly one could make sure that Rakudo and all needed modules are installed on each node, and then scp a script over and run it, or if you have a whole tree, a tarball that is extracted and then run.  You can also package up the full environment into a container and ship that around to execute.

[21:14] *** kylese left
[21:26] <drakonis> hmm, that would be a way, yes.

[21:26] <drakonis> but it can be improved

[21:38] <drakonis> its not the exact solution i wanted, but it exists, at least.

[21:39] <drakonis> ha, i phrased that poorly.
