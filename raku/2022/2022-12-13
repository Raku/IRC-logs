[15:36] <dutchie> `-> ($l, $r) {}` takes one argument and deconstructs it

[15:37] <mcmillhj> ahh, okay. thank you dutchie.

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> very good question, just got mentioned like 2 hours ago

[15:52] <mcmillhj> probably by someone else doing aoc :)  I can check the logs

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if I were to guess, [] doesn't say "put this inside an array" but "store this as an array"

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm afraid this should be checked on the syntax level, unless you are lucky to pinpoint it somewhere in the docs

[15:54] <mscha> "someone else doing aoc", yup, me.  :-)

[15:54] <mscha> Final version I'm happy with: https://github.com/mscha/aoc/blob/master/aoc2022/aoc13b

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/[%20]

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> luck might be on our side today - this is just an operator

[15:56] <mcmillhj> Oh okay, I initially did today's problem in JS because the input was valid JSON. Was trying to clean it up in Raku. I did a similar multi sub compare but wasn't zipping the two lists together.

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 😂

[15:58] <mscha> The input is also valid Perl with `eval`, but not Raku with `.EVAL`.  Well, it's valid Raku, but it collapses arrays with one element, that's why this came up before.

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lately, I've been addicted to this module that helps you look up source code in the compiler

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so here we go: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/704a05b934ba10f3240e8764827bbfd7fe089cdf/src/core.c/array_operators.pm6#L13

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the very line that gets triggered

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Array.from-list([]) gives []

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the source also hints that [$[]] would indeed be an array inside an array

[16:14] <Xliff> Is that the correct way to invoke a RAKUAST enabled program?

[16:22] <mcmillhj> mscha what does the `?*` passed to `.first(?*)` mean in your solution?

[16:22] <mscha> First one with a true value.

[16:22] <mscha> Values are Less, Same, More.  More == 0, so ?More = False

[16:53] <mscha> Problem with .EVAL:

[16:53] <mscha> m: dd '[[[[1]]]]'.EVAL

[16:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar d52342eb0: OUTPUT: «[1]␤»

[16:54] <mscha> But I guess that doesn't actually make a difference for the answer.

[16:55] <mscha> m: use JSON::Fast; dd from-json('[[[[1]]]]');

[16:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar d52342eb0: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Could not find JSON::Fast in:␤    /home/camelia/.raku␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/perl6/site␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/perl6/vendor␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/sh…»

[16:55] <mscha> Oh well.  But that does work.

[18:15] <tonyo> lizmat: does the wordpress have linkbacks ?

[18:15] <lizmat> think it does, yes

[18:16] <tonyo> can you add one so we don't get flagged for the post today?

[18:16] <tonyo> should be https://deathbykeystroke.com/articles/20221205-virtual-environments-in-raku.html

[18:16] <tonyo> jj gave me authorship but i can't seem to edit that post

[18:17] <lizmat> authorship on WP ?

[18:18] <lizmat> do you have a WP login?

[18:19] <lizmat> tonyo386 ?

[19:00] <rf> Hey folks! Are there any Raku books that people recommend to get started with? I've been using Raku for about a month but i'd like to go deeper into it.

[19:03] <lizmat> https://raku.org/resources/ has a few book suggestions

[19:08] <rf> Thanks!

[20:54] <mcmillhj> @mscha This is how my day13 turned out: https://github.com/mcmillhj/aoc/blob/main/2022/13/distress-signal.raku. I updated my Array -> Array comparison to use your zip solution since it looked a lot cleaner. Main difference is `multi` subs for compare.

[20:59] <vrurg> .tell Xliff Correction. For test to work with RAKUDO_RAKUAST env RakuAST must fully or nearly fully complete which is far the case. Tests in 12-rakuast are for already implemented nodes only.

[20:59] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[21:03] <hobbified> oh, that's smart

[21:05] <hobbified> (using multi sub instead of a big type switch)
