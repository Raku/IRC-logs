[02:34] <tellable6> 2022-04-22T23:14:19Z #raku <patrickb> melezhik: I have pushed some more progress to Devel::ExecRunnerGenerator. Now a `ake test-setup deploy-runner` is the incantation to use.

[02:39] *** melezhik left
[02:54] *** melezhik joined
[02:58] <melezhik> .tell patrickb I could think about custom build command that would replace a default one in SparkyCI , in that case - "ake test-setup deploy-runner" ... "zef install --depsonly && zef test ." will be still required afterwards?

[02:58] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[08:15] <p6steve> drakonis: why not distribute as a binary docker image? (like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51659312/converting-a-sourcebinary-docker-image-into-a-binary-only-docker-image)??

[08:19] <drakonis> size and lack of guarantees

[08:20] <drakonis> plus it's supposed to be a library, so docker seems kind of weird

[09:25] <hythm> m: multi f(int, int) {}; f(7, 42)  ## is this a bug?

[09:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller f(Int:D, Int:D); none of these signatures matches:␤    (int, int)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:31] <lizmat> hythm: it's a known issue / problem / feature

[09:31] <lizmat> consider this:

[09:31] <lizmat> m: multi a(int $a) { dd }; multi a(Int:D) { dd }; a 42

[09:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «sub a(Int:D)␤»

[09:32] <lizmat> if you want to have dispatch based on native or not native, you need to fail your case

[09:32] <lizmat> otherwise my example would be an ambiguous dispatch

[09:33] <lizmat> m: multi a(int $a) { dd }; multi a(Int:D) { dd }; a my int $ =42

[09:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «sub a(int $a)␤»

[13:36] <patrickb> melezhik: That module is still in flux. My feeling is, that I would use the Akefile for the non standard setup bits (building the test support files and the runner itself) and separately do the `zef install --deps-only . && zef test ." in a standard manner.

[16:34] <tellable6> hey melezhik, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/4c067f90c75f4a146fdaab96a8a745da

[16:36] <melezhik> .tell patrickb sounds good, this matches current sparkyci design ... I think I may create custom pre build hook allowing to pass any arbitrary bash command that would precede "zef install ...&& zef test " main logic , this where you could tap in your ake command ...

[21:34] <colomon> o/ all.  What's the current state of the art in lightweight database-y things for Raku?  Need some permanent store for a project, and while I could hack up something with text files, something a bit smarter than that where the work's already been done would be nice...

[21:35] <El_Che> there is a sqllite modules I see

[21:35] <El_Che> (I haven't used it)

[21:43] <japhb> colomon: If lightweight is the key, El_Che is right -- probably use the SQLite driver.  If you want something more multi-user robust, try Db::Pg.  If you want an ORM, layer Red on top of Db::Pg.
