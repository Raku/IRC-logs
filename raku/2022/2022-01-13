[00:54] <tbrowder> ref my class stub problem earlier: i got it fixed by "unstubbing" the classes, but i think the docs may need tweaking a

[00:56] <tbrowder> bit by an expert. when i get a chance i'll try to get the smallest example i can to show "my problem" for the folks here to consider

[05:37] <japhb> tonyo: What do you mean by "cross platform masked input"?

[05:38] <samebchase> Where can I find out the package pq:ver<5>:from<native>

[05:38] <samebchase> what is it?

[05:38] <samebchase> can't seem to find anything in raku.land

[05:39] <samebchase> Is it https://github.com/lib/pq ?

[06:13] <japhb> samebchase: I think it's the Postgres client library.  If you are sure you have it installed, you can probably ignore it at `zef install` time.

[06:24] <samebchase> I was on an old version of PG, upgrading it and reinstalling libpq using homebrew worked

[15:05] <rir> In the source for the Raku docs, I'd like to link to the glossary entry for the 'adverbial pair' from _another_ file.  Since that entry does not  have a header like entries I've found, I'm unsure of syntax for the link.

[15:07] *** reportable6 joined
[15:23] <[Coke]> adverbial pair does have a header and an X<> entry in the glossary.

[15:23] <Skarsnik> Could be nice to provide zef with the rakudo windows build x)

[15:23] <[Coke]> glossary links are like: 314:L<val|/routine/val> routine converts it to L<allomorph|/language/glossary#Allomorph>.

[15:23] <Skarsnik> ho nvm

[15:24] <Skarsnik> it's in the share/perl6/ x)

[15:24] <[Coke]> so L<Adverbial Pair|/language/glossary#Adverbial Pair> probably?

[15:28] *** Sgeo joined
[15:51] <rir> Thanks, Coke.

[16:08] <Skarsnik> gah, install cro on windows does not work since lot of native lib try to be build ~~

[16:25] <Skarsnik> hm, is that a zef issue?

[16:25] <Skarsnik> You may need to configure one of the following backends, or install its underlying software - [pswebrequest]

[16:30] <ugexe> no its a raku issue. the logic to fire that warning is just https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7d6b48db23eaca06c332fa6d0ca8ecae80ae83d4/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/curl.rakumod#L71-L73

[16:30] <ugexe> it happens randomly to people

[16:31] <ugexe> if you run it again it will almost certainly work

[16:31] <MasterDuke> also, isn't the git: protocol now disabled by github?

[16:32] <ugexe> i dunno if its disabled yet, but yeah

[16:33] <ugexe> that wouldn't affect that error message though

[16:35] <Skarsnik> zef seems to hangout/stuck installing stuff now ~~

[23:13] <tonyo> japhb: preventing an echo from a keystroke

[23:24] <japhb> tonyo: If you're talking about entering a password, with either no echo, or some random character(s), Terminal::LineEditor can do that.  If you're talking about reading individual keystrokes, there are a couple modules with that capability (including the intermediate-level classes within Terminal::LineEditor).

[23:24] <tonyo> how does terminal::lineeditor do that?

[23:25] <tonyo> fez does it, it's a trivial problem between modern win/osx/linux but it's not necessarily trivial beyond that

[23:25] <tonyo> also, talking about grabbing individual chars

[23:26] <japhb> Oh, as soon as it starts accepting input, it is in "raw" input mode, so that it can handle any keystrokes and map them appropriately.  So choosing to print something different from the key pressed is trivial.

[23:27] <japhb> The code in Terminal::LineEditor is based on my work in https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/RawInput.pm6 and https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/DecodedInput.pm6

[23:27] <japhb> though somewhat modernized

[23:27] <tonyo> where is the bit that actually prevents echo?

[23:28] <japhb> I am also continuing to work on that in order to make it easier to subclass -- I now have a version locally that allows a combination of mouse input, keyboard input, and CLI and full-screen TUI interfaces.

[23:28] <japhb> tonyo: As soon as you go raw.  Here, lemme find the lines

[23:29] <japhb> https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/RawInput.pm6#L16

[23:29] <japhb> Term::termios's makeraw helper

[23:29] <tonyo> oh, so it's Term::termios

[23:29] <tonyo> need to interview someone, going to look trace that down afterwards

[23:30] <tonyo> that rpg demo is cool

[23:30] <japhb> OK.  Here's the newer variation of the code, in the following two methods: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/blob/main/lib/Terminal/LineEditor/RawTerminalInput.rakumod#L272

[23:31] <japhb> :-)  You should see the current version.  :-)

[23:37] <tonyo> this is what i was looking for
