[00:07] <ToddAndMargo> I think I understand.  Would yo mind throwing me togher a quic example usiong

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo> C++

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo> typedef struct _WTS_SESSION_INFOA {

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo>   DWORD                  SessionId;

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo>   LPSTR                  pWinStationName;

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo>   WTS_CONNECTSTATE_CLASS State;

[00:07] <ToddAndMargo> } WTS_SESSION_INFOA, *PWTS_SESSION_INFOA;

[00:07] *** reportable6 left
[00:08] <ToddAndMargo> the dll is wtsapi32

[00:10] *** reportable6 joined
[00:17] *** Guest89 left
[00:26] *** epony left
[00:31] *** lichtkind left
[00:32] *** lucerne joined
[00:38] <ToddAndMargo> I guess what is confusing me  on https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#Specifying_the_native_representation is where is the tag that says what dll the structure is coming from:    is native("wtsapi32")

[00:38] <ToddAndMargo>    is symbol("WTSSendMessageA")

[00:41] <guifa_> it would be something like `class WTS_SESSION_INFOA is repr<CStruct> { has uint16 $.SessionID; has [LPSTR] $.pWinStationName; has WTS_CONNECTSTATE_CLASS $.State }`

[00:42] <guifa_> You may need to use a HAS instead of has for the $.State depending on if it's a pointer or not (I'd guess it's not, since LPStr that definitely is one is named with p at the start)

[00:43] <guifa_> LPSTR I think is best defined as CArray[uint16] 

[00:43] <guifa_> but I could be wrong

[00:50] <ToddAndMargo> Do I not need to tell it the name of the structure (WTS_SESSION_INFOA) is coming from wtsapi32.dll?

[00:51] *** Guest89 joined
[00:53] <ToddAndMargo> In my NativeConstants.pm6 module, I have the followign defined: constant BYTE := uint8; constant LPSTR = CArray[BYTE];

[00:53] *** epony joined
[00:54] <ToddAndMargo> So I figure I can remove the [] from LPSTR

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo> Next step.

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>    C++

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>     BOOL WTSEnumerateSessionsA(

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>       [in]  HANDLE             hServer,

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>     # WTS_CURRENT_SERVER_HANDLE to use the RD Session Host server that hosts your application.

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>       [in]  DWORD              Reserved,

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>       [in]  DWORD              Version,

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>       [out] PWTS_SESSION_INFOA *ppSessionInfo,

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>       [out] DWORD              *pCount

[00:57] <ToddAndMargo>     );

[00:59] <ToddAndMargo> *ppSessionInfo points to the first instance of my WTS_SESSION_INFOA object.  *pCount tells me how many of these objects there are.  How do I loop through them?

[04:11] <guifa_> My guess is you define it as a CArray[PWTS_SESSION_INFOA], because presumably those should be stored in order in memory, aand then you iterate through using pCount, e.g. for ^pCount { sessionInfo[$_] }

[06:29] <Xliff> Looping through struct arrays is not so simple. NativeCall does NOT support it.

[06:29] <Xliff> You have to use C tricks to get at the data.

[06:30] <Xliff> Please see the role here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GLib/blob/master/lib/GLib/Roles/TypedBuffer.pm6

[06:31] <Xliff> Feel free to copy and use it. To get at your struct array, you would use "GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer[PWTS_SESSION_INFOA].new($.ppSessionInfo).Array"

[06:31] <Xliff> If you would rather manually set the size, then it is:

[06:32] <Xliff> "my $l = GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer[PWTS_SESSION_INFOA].new($.ppSessionInfo); $l.setSize($.pCount); $l.Array"

[06:33] <Xliff> You might need...

[06:33] <Xliff> "my $l = GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer[PWTS_SESSION_INFOA].new($.ppSessionInfo); $l.setSize($.pCount, :forced); $l.Array"

[06:33] *** bd3i left
[06:34] <Xliff> And if that still doesn't work, try this one:

[06:34] <Xliff> "my $l = GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer[PWTS_SESSION_INFOA].new($.ppSessionInfo, :!autosize); $l.setSize($.pCount, :forced); $l.Array"

[12:51] <SmokeMachine> (or code)

[12:53] <lizmat> --per-line='*.lines.grep(*.starts-with("#").not)

[12:53] <lizmat> or similar

[12:54] <lizmat> the --per-line defaults to *.lines

[12:54] <lizmat> but you can put anything in there that produces lines 

[12:55] <lizmat> but I guess it could actually warrant a separate flag

[12:56] <lizmat> --starting-with="#"    or --/starting-with="#" ?

[12:57] <lizmat> or maybe something more general, like an additional "and" pattern ?

[16:45] *** razetime joined
[16:57] <tonyo> melezhik if you run that command manually/locally does it ask if you'd like to proceed with the upload anyway?

[16:58] *** melezhik joined
[16:58] <tonyo> wondering if you're hitting this https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/blob/master/lib/Fez/CLI.rakumod#L535

[16:58] <melezhik> Tony the thing is - I don't run this manually - it gets run by pipeline

[16:59] <tonyo> right

[16:59] <tonyo> but if that checkbuild prompts then it'll be stuck waiting on tty, which you should be able to find out locally

[17:00] <melezhik> according the report checkbuld has passed , as I can see the next step (`tom --clean`) also succeeded - https://github.com/melezhik/sparrowci-sandbox/blob/main/sparrow.yaml#L35

[17:01] <tonyo> the other thing i'm thinking is that your docker container has no route to api.zef.pm

[17:01] <melezhik> the line "cleaning /var/.sparrowdo/env/fez-upload/.sparrowdo/source/.tom/.cache ..." means it proceeds to the next step (the last before `fez upload`)

[17:01] <melezhik> why?

[17:01] <melezhik> I mean `fez checkbuild` succeeds ...

[17:01] <melezhik> line - "01:59:46 :: >>= SparrowCI-SandBox:ver<0.0.1>:auth<zef:melezhik> looks OK"

[17:02] <melezhik> https://ci.sparrowhub.io/report/1865

[17:02] <melezhik> let me try "echo Y | fez upload" )))

[17:06] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: that would still mach substrings inside comments that's at the end of the line, right?

[17:07] <lizmat> ah, ok, so you want Raku's semantics for the use of '#' as a comment indicator

[17:07] <lizmat> that's tricky:

[17:07] <lizmat> m: my $foo = '#'; sat $foo

[17:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17062c32f: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    sat used at line 1. Did you mean 'set', 'say'?␤␤»

[17:07] <lizmat> m: my $foo = '#'; say $foo

[17:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17062c32f: OUTPUT: «#␤»

[17:12] <melezhik> tonyo - nope - does not help - https://ci.sparrowhub.io/report/1882

[17:12] <tonyo> melezhik: can you run a trace rt to api.zef.pm in there?

[17:13] <melezhik> which http client do you use in your code?

[17:14] <tonyo> it uses curl or wget 

[17:14] <melezhik> curl?

[17:14] <melezhik> https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/blob/master/lib/Fez/Util/Curl.rakumod

[17:14] <melezhik> I see

[17:15] *** razetime left
[17:15] <tonyo> you can run the command `curl --trace-ascii - api.zef.pm`

[17:15] <melezhik> ok

[17:15] <tonyo> is this using docker?

[17:16] <melezhik> pipeline gets run in docker container

[17:23] <tonyo> none of those are the correct ip address

[17:24] <tonyo> should be resolving to 52.26.243.128

[17:24] <melezhik> ah, ok, what does it mean? cached dns?

[17:25] <melezhik> but wait, why does then zef install work?

[17:25] <tonyo> hmm, maybe?  it should resolve to 44.238.102.180, 52.26.243.128, 35.166.18.46

[17:25] <tonyo> what is the dns it is using?  can you hardcode it to 8.8.8.8 as a test?

[17:26] <melezhik> want me dump resolve.conf?

[17:26] <tonyo> sure

[17:26] <melezhik> ok, I will rerun pipeline

[17:29] <melezhik> wait a sec, it should be my physical host, not docker one issue

[17:31] <melezhik> I believed it should be `curl --trace-ascii - https://api.zef.pm` not just http?

[17:32] <melezhik> curl --trace-ascii - https://api.zef.pm works just fine
