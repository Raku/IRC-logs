[12:48] <tbrowder> howdy all   \o
[12:49] <tbrowder> got a problem with stubbing classes before defining them...
[12:51] <tbrowder> classes are nested so one class name is like this: Spreadsheets::Classes::WorkbookSet
[12:52] <tbrowder> inside its rakumod file stub lline is "class WorkbookSet {...}"
[12:53] <tbrowder> later in the same file class definition starts: "class WorkbookSet {"
[12:53] <tbrowder> the using script has use line "use Spreadsheets:"
[12:54] <tbrowder> that module has use line "use Spreadsheets::Classes;"
[12:56] <tbrowder> when script is executed, error is "package Spreadsheets::Classes::WorkbookSet is stubbed but not defined"
[12:57] <tbrowder> the module file are headed by "unit module ...:"
[12:57] <lizmat> not class Spreadsheets::Classes::WorkbookSet ?
[12:59] <tbrowder> no, the class is inside a unit module. do i need an "is export"? i tried that once but it didn't help
[13:00] <tbrowder> but i put it on the definition, not the stub
[13:02] <tbrowder> i may have a hidden bug there because i found one earlier with a spurious "class Foo is {" line not being pinpointed"
[13:03] *** jjido joined
[13:03] <tbrowder> and i am also use multiple "use Bar:from<Perl5>" statements
[13:05] <tbrowder> i'll come back later with a simpler example if i don't make any progress, thnx
[13:09] <tbrowder> but, in general, shoulld i need an "is export" inside a "unit module" file with multiple defined classes?
[13:11] *** sena_kun_ joined
[13:13] *** sena_kun left
[13:13] *** dakkar left
[13:14] *** dakkar joined
[13:15] <lizmat> is it a "my class" ?
[13:29] <tbrowder> no, but i just tried a simple sample and a plain "is export {" on the class solved the problem of scope.
[13:30] <tbrowder> i think i have hidden issues requiring more work.
[13:30] <El_Che> that sounds very psycho-analytical of you
[13:32] <tbrowder> heh, hidden self-inflicted bugs not known by rakudo? surely that's not possible
[13:33] <tbrowder> but i probably do need more analysis, psycho and otherwise
[13:34] <tbrowder> i need to ensure i have the latest Inline::Perl5 for one thing

[17:56] <Tirifto> Hello! If a potential issue is found, would be the next best alternative to opening an issue on GitHub? Writing to the ‘perl6-users’ mailing list?
[17:58] <lizmat> mentioning it here with a gist ?
[17:58] *** [Coke] joined
[18:07] *** MoC joined
[18:07] <nine> But really, what's wrong with opening an issue on Github?
[18:08] <lizmat> Tirifto: if you don't have a Github login, that's an issue  (pun intended :-)
[18:08] *** reportable6 left
[18:09] *** reportable6 joined
[18:12] <[Coke]> I think we've had 3-4 people over the years who wanted to report something but refused to open a ticket; If they send an email to the users list or something, that's usually sufficient.
[18:12] <tbrowder> tonyo: thnx, i’ll do that if i can’t solve it.  i’m zeroing in on it now…
[18:13] <Geth> ¦ doc: sdondley++ created pull request #4013: update information about methods for distributing modules
[18:13] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4013
[18:14] <[Coke]> man, does this tmobile 5g home internet drop a lot.

[18:16] <Tirifto> nine: GitHub won’t let me register an account without running non-free software; I try to avoid that whenever possible.
[18:16] <El_Che> Tirifto: you don't have a FOSS browser?
[18:18] <Tirifto> El_Che: I do, but the registration form won’t work unless I run non-free JavaScript code in it. (Usually it’s some kind of a captcha.)
[18:20] <El_Che> I see
[18:25] <tbrowder> Tirifto: speaking only for myself, I would appreciate any issue report to be in a Markdown file so the problem code can be cleanly shown
[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat If I want to have a blog post of mine listed in your weekly updates how I should proclaim that?

[20:49] <atweiden_> vrurg: ed7911165598b17265b2be8c5af1cf6ceb2bbc6f makes config-toml tests fail on rakudo v2021.12
[20:49] <atweiden_> is it possible to not break backwards compatibility — perhaps through META6.json?
[20:55] <vrurg> atweiden_: can you make it a link? I don't remember what is it about.
[20:55] <vrurg> I mean, what exact change is in the commit.

[20:59] <atweiden_> Is there some way to specify, via META6.json or elsewise, that raku v2021.12 and earlier may not install version X of a module?

[21:26] <vrurg> atweiden_: Not 'raku 2021.12' but 'rakudo 2021.12'. I'm afraid, no, there is no such limitation. What it comes to compiler dependency I use $*RAKU.compiler.version
[21:26] <vrurg> m: say $*RAKU.compiler.version

[21:28] <vrurg> Oh, and I see why the commit breaks on the older compiler. But it only breaks the test alone. You could have just different compiler-dependent if branches in the test alone.
[21:41] <atweiden_> that could be a good interim solution

[22:56] <japhb> (Backlogging) thowe guifa [Coke] tonyo -- I answered thowe's question in https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/issues/1 but essentially yes, Terminal::LineEditor supports tab completion (and history, and ANSI prompts, and wide unicode chars, and ...) -- you can look at the Terminal::LineEditor support in Raku's REPL for a quickstart.
[22:57] <japhb> I didn't put the tab completion API in the README because I felt like it needed more work to go from Linenoise-level to really swanky 
[22:58] <japhb> (like showing docs next to possible expansions, or showing fill-in parameter lists, or so)
[22:58] <japhb> Still, if what you need is basic tab completion and history, it should handily do the job.
[23:05] *** jjido left
[23:12] <thowe> \o/
[23:13] <thowe> I eagerly await the swankiness.
[23:13] <thowe> And I commented on github
