[05:39] <cnx> hi, is there any collection of raku grammar for programming languages?

[06:10] *** reportable6 left

[06:48] *** Sgeo left
[07:40] <moritz> I don't really know of a collection; there's rakudo itself for parsing raku, there are various JSON parsers (I happen to like JSON::Tiny, because I wrote it :D)

[07:41] <moritz> and I guess you could browse https://modules.raku.org/ for interesting modules

[07:43] <cnx> thanks for the pointer

[07:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the cool kids browse raku.land these days, lizmat opened an issue for deprecating modules.raku.org even

[07:59] <jjatria> cnx: TOML::Thumb is implemented as a grammar as well. But I guess the question is what do you mean "collection?"

[08:01] <tellable6> Sorry kid, that's not my department.

[08:04] *** dakkar joined
[08:12] <cnx> jjatria, i meant something like https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4, i.e. grammars for multiple languages
