[17:51] <tonyo> is cro seriously borked on current rakudo?

[17:51] <tonyo> having trouble with it on osx, bsd, and opensuse

[17:52] <lizmat> does not sound familiar to me, at least on MacOS

[17:52] <lizmat> lemme check more thoroughly  :-)

[17:52] <tonyo> all of these are fresh installs

[17:53] <tonyo> digest fails on opensuse, once past that openssl fails on all three, and if i force that then opensuse dies with problems in http::hpack

[17:53] <tonyo> iirc digest also fails outright on the other two

[17:54] <lizmat> I've just restarted my local test logs server, which is on master and all, and do not see anything strange

[17:55] <tonyo> i'll retry on current master

[17:55] <tonyo> i'm on v2021.12-141-g3823f88ce.

[18:02] <japhb> tonyo: Digest is the one that's been blocking my upgrade for a while; I'm on Linux Mint.

[18:02] <tonyo> trying to get an article together for tbrowder - what version of rakudo are you on? (or which commit was last known good)?
