[00:05] <abdan> How do we perform alternate capturing group consist of some alternates just like on the "usual" regex default i.e. not get reset ?

[00:39] <[Coke]> Your message made it through.

[00:39] <[Coke]> Most of the channel is in .eu time zones, FYI

[00:43] <[Coke]> I don't understand the ask, myself. can you give a more concrete example?

[01:07] <lucs> Er, they left.

[01:10] <Voldenet> but logs are eternal

[01:11] <lucs> FSVO "eternal", but, fair enough :)

[01:14] <Voldenet> I'll have them carved in stone to win an interned dispute ;)

[01:14] <lucs> Hehe!

[01:18] <Voldenet> I could suggest burning them onto wooden slices, but data rot could get them at some point

[15:49] <whatnext> hello all :)  I have a question about CRO - if there are any CRO experts around :)

[15:52] <whatnext> say I have some routes, and I want e.g. a new database connection each time any route is called, so my routes might be like `get -> 'page' { $db_connection.do_something() }` - how can I avoid explicitly creating $db_connection in every route?

[16:14] <MasterDuke> i don't know, but you could also try asking in #cro

[16:18] <whatnext> ah I didn't realise that channel existed - thanks for the tip :)
