[16:54] <tbrowder> m: say $*TZ

[16:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 454752e3e: OUTPUT: ¬´7200‚ê§¬ª

[16:55] <tonyo> way wrong, i'm minus double that

[16:56] <tbrowder> heh, morning, tonyo !

[16:57] <tonyo> how's it going?

[16:57] <tbrowder> can you imagine a situation where a "normal" system doesn't provide a timezone number?

[16:59] <tbrowder> going well, thank you. using yr cro/apache cookbook is on my TODO list

[16:59] *** jgaz left
[17:01] <tbrowder> i'm working on a subclass of DateTime and trying to figure how much faith to put into $*TZ as a reasonable indicator of longitude (center of 15 degree slices, that is)

[17:04] <tbrowder> my gut tells me to rely on it but let the user know about it during or after installation

[17:05] <tbrowder> the longitude is in lieu of having a suitable db of world timezone info

[17:06] <tbrowder> i've looked at DateTime::Timezones but i'm not sure it's in a convenient format

[17:09] <guifa_> the problem with using the number as representative of longitude is that many parts of the world run far off from their "natural" time

[17:10] <tbrowder> what i'm doing at the moment is taking local time from DateTime (default is UTC) and letting the user enter an abbeviation for his TZ and   offer to incorporate that info into my own db

[17:11] <guifa_> Olson IDs will get you much closer, since they're designed to be anchored to large population centers (which are more stable than, say, countries)

[17:13] <tbrowder> guifa_: yes, and i'm not sure how best to handle it, though. unless there is a system value of lat/long, user entry is probably the way i'll go.

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> +1 for guifa

[17:13] <guifa_> WIth that, the Europe/Madrid will get you a much more accurate rendition of location for someone in GMT+1 than someone in Europe/Bratislava

[17:14] <guifa_> plus DST might make someone appear to jump around

[17:16] <tbrowder> i have 99+ percent of US covered, for now i'm allowing user to enter tz abbrev and taking his system $*TZ for the "truth"

[17:20] <tbrowder> hm, i forgot about %ENV<TZ> to get the full name, gotta go back to DateTime::TimeZones...

[17:21] <tbrowder> thanks for the inspiration, gang

[17:21] <guifa_> You could also use

[17:21] <guifa_> https://raku.land/github:alabamenhu/UserTimezone

[17:22] <guifa_> I have an update I need to publish

[17:22] <tbrowder> uh, that's DateTime::TimeZone

[17:22] <guifa_> No, that just gets you the name of their timezone

[17:23] <guifa_> it doesn't have any dependencies

[17:27] <tbrowder> does alabamenhu's module have dst info?

[17:27] <guifa_> I can't remember which module I put the code in (and I might not have released it) that converts timezone ids to the more common language ones (e.g. "Eastern standard time") but I haven't had too much time to take a look at those recently, sadly

[17:28] <guifa_> DST can be calculated from the timezone ID + the time.  That info is in Timezones::ZoneInfo

[17:29] <guifa_> but I haven't made it very userfriendly yet

[17:30] <guifa_> basically, feed in a UNIX-epoch time and the zone data, and it'll provide a tm struct that gives you the date/time with a flag for DST

[17:31] <guifa_> e.g.

[17:32] <tbrowder> erg, i think i'll wait unless i can grok it

[17:32] <guifa_> my %data = calendar-from-posix(now.to-posix, timezone-data user-timezone)

[17:33] <guifa_> %data<dst> # 0 = standard, 1 = daylight savings

[17:33] <guifa_> %data<gmt-offset> # offset in seconds

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> isn't alabamenhu the same person as guifa for all intents and purposes? üòÑ

[17:34] <guifa_> %data<tz-abbr> # common abbreviation (e.g. "CST" "EDT")

[17:34] <guifa_> Nemokosch we are :-)

[17:35] <tbrowder> i think so, but he's been confusing me for years and i forget that.

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> üòÇ

[17:38] <guifa_> someone namesquats me on github and the world goes to hell lol

[17:40] <tbrowder> ok, i will try the module, oops, test failure

[17:41] <guifa_> hmmm

[17:41] <guifa_> i'll try to take a look at it this weekend

[17:42] <guifa_> sorry new job and moved so the past few months I've been very behind on Raku dev stuff =/

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which module?

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> UserTimezone installed ok for me

[17:46] <tbrowder> i just tried Timezones::ZoneInfo as suggested above

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay... also installed correctly for me

[17:49] <tbrowder> do you have latest zed?

[17:49] <guifa_> what was the error?  I'll try to track it down if I can

[17:49] <tbrowder> *zef

[17:51] <tbrowder> oops, too many servers, updating zef now...

[17:54] <sjn> hey, when's the next rakudo release? I see the last one was 2022.07 :-(

[17:54] <tbrowder> t/03-warn.t failed

[17:55] <tbrowder> sjn: hi, i think there are some stoppers

[17:55] <sjn> oh noes! 

[17:56] <sjn> for two months? must have been serious o_O

[17:57] <tbrowder> guifa_: test 03-warn.t failed

[17:57] <tbrowder> gotta go for now, back later

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> with what values?

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, interesting

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I remember there was a broken TAP version, the only thing I'd know with failing tests

[18:15] <guifa_> ah, I guess I should throw in an actual test in there.  But historically that's not caused any problems.
