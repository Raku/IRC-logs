[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why is "The use of hash variables in regexes is reserved" and what does this even mean?

[09:48] <lizmat> Nemokosch: reference ?

[09:48] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[09:50] <MasterDuke> $ variables just interpolate their contents, @ variables interpolate as alternations, % variables don't have a function yet

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> reference: reality

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ===SORRY!===

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The use of hash variables in regexes is reserved

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> at /home/ASTRON-INF/pm7342/raku_helpers/./diffblame.raku:26

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ------>       when /^ 'Csak ebben: ' (%base-path⏏<esko>|%base-path<kako>) (.*?) ': ' (.*)

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does "alternations" mean?

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, I think this is kind of like a sabotage

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> no black magic needed, I just wanted the content

[09:53] <dutchie> m: my @foo = <one two three>; say 'one' ~~ /@foo/ # equivalent to / one | two | three /

[09:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «｢one｣␤»

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so if I do @%base-path

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it will do exactly what I actually need? xD

[09:54] <dutchie> you might want @(%base-path.keys) or something

[09:54] <dutchie> since @%base-path will be a list of pairs

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> values, rather

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but yes

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> let's see...

[09:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well at least it doesn't error, can't check it yet

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you know, these are kind of show-stoppers in my opinion

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Raku is "like a jungle sometimes", its mental load scales uncomparably worse than Python

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in Python, regexes are just strings. This may not be elegant but it's ridiculously powerful once you go beyond trivial in any "deviant" way

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm still yet to find this sort of safety in Raku

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that you can just safely use what you know perfectly

[10:01] <lizmat> well, in Raku, regexes are just another way to write code

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how do I generate it, then?

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I can't always hardcode it

[10:02] <lizmat> well, before RakuAST, using EVAL I'm afraid

[10:03] <lizmat> afaik, RakuAST already has most, if not all, API in place to generate regular expressions

[10:03] <lizmat> nine?  ^^  

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the API doesn't have to be a raw string

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but there is legitimate need for some API

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> RakuAST... it's like the land of promise

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 😂

[10:03] <lizmat> well, yes, it is in a way...

[10:04] <lizmat> a promise that is getting closer...  

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like I am getting closer to a working script

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 😛

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and eventually, I can just "cast" everything to $, for values, this is feasible

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> by the way

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> say you have a dict

[10:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is there a way to obtain values with containers?

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> other than using them LHS in an assignment, of course

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> for example, iterating over the values as containers

[10:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay... is there anything I should know about dynamic variables in react blocks?....

[10:22] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4654 might have some relevant info

[10:22] <lizmat> .values on a Hash returns containers

[10:23] <lizmat> m: my %h = :42a, :666b; dd %h; $_++ for %h.values; dd %h

[10:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {:a(42), :b(666)}␤Hash %h = {:a(43), :b(667)}␤»

[10:23] <lizmat> m: my %h = :42a, :666b; dd %h; $_++ for %h<a b>; dd %h   # also slices

[10:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {:a(42), :b(666)}␤Hash %h = {:a(43), :b(667)}␤»

[10:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> lizmat: I see, that's not bad

[10:26] <lizmat> BTW, same for BagHashes / MixHashes

[10:26] <lizmat> m: my BagHash %h = :42a, :666b; dd %h; $_++ for %h<a b>; dd %h 

[10:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to %h; expected BagHash but got Int (42)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[10:26] <lizmat> ooh

[10:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what about something that retrieves the key as well, either as elements one after the other or as pairs?

[10:26] <lizmat> m: my BagHash %h = :42a, :666b; dd %h; $_++ for %h.values; dd %h 

[10:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to %h; expected BagHash but got Int (42)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[10:27] <lizmat> m: my BagHash %h = (:42a, :666b); dd %h; $_++ for %h.values; dd %h 

[10:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to %h; expected BagHash but got Int (42)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[10:27] <lizmat> hmmm...  /me makes mental note  :-)

[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> MasterDuke: thank you; so long story short, they are pretty much useless

[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> since stdout needs to be tapped before start

[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> basically, the processing code needs to be before start

[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well I can live without them, it's just... at this point, I feel I need a safe subset of Raku

[10:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and I'm afraid the safe subset of Raku wouldn't be much more attractive than Python 😅

[10:35] <SmokeMachine> m: my %h is BagHash = :42a, :666b; dd %h; $_++ for %h.values; dd %h

[10:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «("b"=>666,"a"=>42).BagHash␤("b"=>667,"a"=>43).BagHash␤»

[10:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> don't take me wrong, though

[10:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I will be insanely happy once this works as intended

[10:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but at the same time, this is just a helper script, basically I have this day to see if it's of any use

[10:39] <lizmat> SmokeMachine++   # me clearly not awake enough yet  :-)

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so rw works

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think I messed something up with the destructuring

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oh no, the markdown again...

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so we have $*BLE

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and $*BLA maybe?

[10:50] <SmokeMachine> yes, $*BLA and $*BLE

[10:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I wonder if image attachments are traversed...

[12:37] <p6steve> i could use some help with concurrency ... I would like to do a pattern like this: main (p1) defines a sub(), then forks a new process (p2), p2 calls sub, p1 captures stdout of p2, p2 ends

[12:37] <p6steve> (so the fork has the process context of p1)

[12:39] <p6steve> I couldn't figure out how to do this with Async::Process seems like this is for running an external program

[12:43] <p6steve> I have RTFMd about .fork my $promise = Promise.start( { my $i = 0; for 1 .. 10 { $i += $_ }; $i}

[12:43] <p6steve> );

[12:44] <p6steve> say $promise.result;   oops

[12:44] <p6steve> I have RTFMd about .fork  ... https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-perlfunc#fork

[12:44] <MasterDuke> there has been an nqp::fork added since that doc entry was written

[12:46] <p6steve> MasterDuke: thanks ... I try to live in raku land rather than NQP ... guess that this has not yet surfaced to the raku API?

[12:47] <p6steve> MasterDuke: (how) can I call this NQP fn from raku?

[12:47] <MasterDuke> correct, nor has it been exposed in rakudo

[12:47] <nine> lizmat: yes, RakuAST should have somewhat complete regex support already

[12:47] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say nqp::add_i(1, 2)

[12:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[12:48] <lizmat> nine: I wonder whether it would make sense to put that part of RakuAST already into master ?

[12:48] <lizmat> so that people could start playing with it ?

[12:53] <p6steve> hmmm - I vaguely recall tricks like (post fork) read own pid to decide whether I am p1/p2 then maybe some way to connect std out to std in - but too vaguely to want to go so deep

[12:54] <p6steve> back to the drawing board

[12:58] <lizmat> p6steve: with Raku, you generally don't want to fork

[15:17] <melezhik> Hi!

[15:18] *** jjido left
[15:18] <melezhik> I am thinking about spinning  up a service that allow people to run integration tests against their docker images, similar to SparkyCI but with focus on docker

[15:19] <melezhik> so a user could deploy their docker images into temporary docker instance and run https requests against it

[15:19] <melezhik> or run some ssh commands within docker instance to check internal structure

[15:20] <melezhik> could be useful for Raku devs building services on Raku

[15:20] <melezhik> just testing a water here if this is something people might find useful?

[15:21] <melezhik> I am thinking about testing raku.land or whatever Raku related services that are distributes as docker images

[15:21] <melezhik> again because I am going to build and own this service it's possible to bake as much Raku integration as possible into it ...

[15:22] <melezhik> ant thoughts? I'd appreciate for a feedback  ...

[16:35] <gfldex> Range.join ends up in List.join with a List made with List.from-iterator

[16:37] <gfldex> And since (0..Inf) is lazy, we end up with a stringification for a lazy list.

[16:38] <gfldex> Actually, we might end up with `nqp::if($infinite,'...','')` .

[16:43] <gfldex> m: (0..Inf).join.put

[16:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: «...␤»

[16:48] <gfldex> I can't find stringification of infinite lists in Roast.

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Is %hash>>.methodcall described somewhere in the docs?

[21:05] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#methodop_%C2%BB._/_methodop_%3E%3E.

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't see anything about the behavior with hashes

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The very slight mention I could find at the general hyper description:

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > Hyper operators can work with hashes. The pointy direction indicates if missing keys are to be ignored in the resulting hash. The enclosed operator operates on all values that have keys in both hashes.

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> What does determine the popularity of reddit group? (Lilke /r/rakulang.) The quantity of the posts? The quality? Or, as in Raku's case, "just" the number of Raku-users and/or Raku-curious?

[21:13] <[Coke]> was just pointing at the >>. operator. To offer an example:

[21:14] <[Coke]> m: my %e = <a b c d>; dd %e>>.uc;

[21:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5a82d28b: OUTPUT: «{:a("B"), :c("D")}␤»

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It does seem that de facto it operates on the value

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm already using that

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I was just curious if this behavior is explicitly recorded somewhere

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@297037173541175296> >>. is an operator and those coerce by design. Since >>. will operate on List, it will coerce any LHS to that.

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that doesn't explain the behavior, though. The has turns into a list of pairs, what happens then?

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, new thing

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is the difference between  |(blah) and (blah).Slip?

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that doesn't explain the behavior, though. The hash turns into a list of pairs, what happens then?

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> does this mean they should always work identically? because they don't...

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> again, what is the catch? 😂
