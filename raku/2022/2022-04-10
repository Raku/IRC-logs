[18:49] *** dogbert11 left
[18:51] <nine> drakonis: looks like every BASIC line is compiled into a sub, so it's callable. A more advanced way would be to recognize the constructs that the GOTO is part of (e.g. loops or conditionals) and compile the code to those

[18:53] <drakonis> cool

[18:54] <drakonis> rakudo is still missing the ability to actually jump to arbitrary labels, right?

[18:54] <drakonis> still getting a NYI for label.goto

[22:15] <guifa> drakonis: as author of the module haha, I can say that nine is correct.  If you look in the actions file, above the very verbose RakuAST code is a comment with the corresponding Raku code

[22:15] <drakonis> haha i see

[22:15] <guifa> there's a pointer variable called $BASIC-INDEX

[22:16] <drakonis> it doesnt yet quite behave like basic should

[22:16] <guifa> when you hit goto, it does $BASIC-INDEX = %BASIC-INDEX{$line}

[22:16] *** lichtkind_ left
[22:16] <drakonis> oh, huh, nice.

[22:16] <guifa> where %BASIC-INDEX is a hash that stores the labeled BASIC lines to the indices in an array of statements

[22:17] <drakonis> but real talk

[22:18] <drakonis> i wanted to do TCO and implement the missing goto call on rakudo, where would i even begin with this?

[22:18] <guifa> the main loop is ` while $BASIC-INDEX < X { @BASIC-LINES[$BASIC-INDEX].() } `

[22:18] <guifa> where X is the count of lines

[22:19] <drakonis> i might need a bit of recursion for a build system i'm writing

[22:19] <drakonis> that's a fancy trick

[22:19] <drakonis> it also explains how to call a function stored in the list

[22:19] <guifa> as to implementing GOTO, I'm not sure how far folks have thought out even how it would look like.  e.g. scoping and what not

[22:19] <drakonis> speaking of, that list contains strings?

[22:20] <drakonis> i think there's already some level of GOTO support but not for jumping to arbitrary labels

[22:21] <drakonis> https://docs.raku.org/type/Label

[22:21] <drakonis> only available inside control flow such as loops

[22:21] <drakonis> not much there.

[22:21] <guifa> yeah, it's not really a proper goto

[22:22] <moon-child> afaik goto is nyi

[22:22] <guifa> For the description of goto in Raku you'd need to go to the design docs

[22:22] <drakonis> doesn't nqp provide that either?

[22:22] <drakonis> https://design.raku.org/S04.html#The_goto_statement

[22:23] <drakonis> i remember seeing something on nqp regarding goto

[22:23] <guifa> if it does exist, it's not been documented yet

[22:23] <drakonis> the instruction exists

[22:25] <drakonis> its very much not documented

[22:26] <drakonis> moarvm also implements it but it isnt exposed to nqp yet

[22:26] <drakonis> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp

[22:28] <drakonis> work to be done i see

[22:39] <SmokeMachine> I've finally found a way to use the  `subset` keyword to create my submodules! The `of` on the subset creator is a trait, so I can use a different treat there... So I've created `is sub-model` trait on Red. Now you can do `subset Admin is sub-model of User where *.role eq "admin"`, like this: https://twitter.com/smokemachine/status/1513284311969157127?s=20&t=_1KThBEqad7x7APBzma-eA
