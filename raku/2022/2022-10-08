[16:55] <hythm> is the above `Version` comparisons intended or a bug?

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know but it's kinda sane if you think about it

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one is "one dot ten", the other is essentially "one dot one"

[17:18] <lizmat> hythm: I understand that behaviour is correct

[17:19] <El_Che> I don't understand the 1.0010 usecase

[17:19] <El_Che> (except if your retired perl programmer)

[17:20] <El_Che> m: say Version.new( '1.1.2' ) cmp Version.new( '1.1.1' )

[17:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 25c76aed0: OUTPUT: «More␤»

[17:20] <El_Che> semver ready \o/

[17:20] <ugexe> its because of how leading zeros are treated

[17:20] <ugexe> m: say Version.new("1.001").parts

[17:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 25c76aed0: OUTPUT: «(1 1)␤»

[17:25] <hythm> the `1.0010` use case came from  `IO::CatHandle::AutoLines` and was expecting `v1.1` since it's the latest release but `v1.001004` won  https://github.com/Raku/REA/tree/main/meta/I/IO::CatHandle::AutoLines

[17:27] <ugexe> see: https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/dffc2a4cec4a1b91a14289a88cead3ceecd5f5b4/S02-types/version.t#L26-L34

[20:17] <tidux> Is there some magic that nqp does to find a moar binary?  I copied a working moar binary to ./install/moar from the root of the nqp source tree but it still throws a "no moar executable found" error

[20:20] *** Sgeo joined
[20:23] <ugexe> shouldn't it be copied to ./install/bin/moar ?

[20:25] <tidux> ah

[20:26] <tidux> well you'd think so but trying to use --prefix for nqp/moarvm/rakudo has been annoyingly inconsistent on that front

[20:26] <tidux> so I wasn't sure

[20:29] <Voldenet> I just do `perl Configure.pl –prefix=/opt/rakudo-2022-10` for all the repos and it works

[20:37] <MasterDuke> i've never had a problem with --prefix, but fwiw, you can build with --relocatable and then you can move your rakudo installation around.

[20:37] <tidux> X-Y problem alert: it turns out it was due to a limitation in my environment (Termux on Android)

[20:38] <tidux> setting my prefix for everything to a directory I actually had write permissions for solved it

[20:38] <tidux> I now have raku+zef installed
