[01:29] <Nemokosch> so yeah, I find it funny that the same people who argued that .flatmap is redundant and confusing, went on to provide flat map ..., flat .map(...) kind of equivalents, thereby illustrating redundance as a virtue and actually confusing code

[14:10] <guifa> I'm writing a helper script to aid debugging of a module that I think could be useful to folks

[14:10] <guifa> but naming it is bad.  It's to search for a binary sequence and binarysearch is such a misnomer haha

[14:14] *** jjido left
[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does "search for a binary sequence" even mean here?

[14:17] <guifa> really I guess finding a byte sequence

[14:17] <guifa> or doing a search in binary mode rather than in text mode

[14:17] * guifa is somehow having a bad link between some data and offsets, but debugging that isn't super pleasant

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how is this used?

[14:19] <guifa> so the helper script will take a file and a sequence of data and find all instances of that (grep-like style), and output the offset, along side the found sequence highlighted with a few bytes of data before and after to put it in context

[14:19] <guifa> like thinking textwise I'd do

[14:20] <guifa> binarysearch abcdefabcdef  efa

[14:20] <guifa> output would be

[14:20] <guifa> 4 cd EFA bc

[16:29] <guifa> ugh

[16:30] <guifa> I think this might actually be a bug in buf handling

[16:30] <lizmat> ?

[16:31] <guifa> so testing this search function with a four byte needle

[16:31] <guifa> sub is do-search($haystack, $needle) {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}¬†

[16:31] <guifa> if I immediately print the needle, it shows up as four bytes

[16:31] <guifa> but later on in the function, it's transformed magically to a two byte needle, but I never reassign anywhere

[16:32] <lizmat> interesting

[16:32] <lizmat> can you golf that ?

[16:32] <guifa> Let me see if I can

[16:38] <guifa> okay nm I'm an idiot and left a debug code somewhere

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It would be so good to see Daniel with regards to anything that isn't just CAT...

[17:13] <guifa> WOW

[17:13] <guifa> I've literally spent like 10 days debugging this thing

[17:13] <guifa> and it's all because somewhere along the way I managed to zero out a dynamic variable, and so the reason my binary data files seemed off is that they WERE NEVER UPDATED

[17:13] <lizmat> yuk

[17:13] <guifa> on the other hand, I have a nifty little binary grepper function

[17:16] <lizmat> looks cool

[17:19] <jast> I once spent two weeks of debugging to finally realize there was an extra comma in my code that one particular implementation silently failed on (this was not Raku, obviously)

[17:19] <guifa> jast: ouch

[17:20] <jast> but it's still great when you finally find an issue like that :)

[17:20] <guifa> not to delete the ungodly number of lines of debug code that were for naught

[17:20] <jast> hahaha

[17:20] <jast> still better than not finding the problem at all

[17:24] <jast> great example of how assumptions ("everything else probably works") will sometimes end up wasting more time than checking them (and of course sometimes you're not even fully aware of the assumption in question...)

[21:13] <Demos[m]> like if I _only_ define `my package EXPORT::DEFAULT {}` then things work, but `Whatever::.perl` doesn't show any `EXPORT` package like if I use `is export`

[21:15] <Demos[m]> oh

[21:36] <melezhik> I've added GoLang support to SparrowCI pipelines (WIP, but ¬†the major part of ¬†API is implemented ) - https://twitter.com/melezhik2/status/1591182799692005376/photo/1

[21:37] <melezhik> now users can write Sparrow tasks in golang, no compilation is required SparrowCI will do it on the fly

[21:38] <melezhik> pipeline example of interacting Raku and Golang task is here - https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI/blob/main/examples/go/task2.yaml

[21:40] <melezhik> once tasks is compiled into a binary , it's not going to be recompiled next time, so this should be pretty fast

[21:57] <Demos[m]> also are use and need actually equivalent?

[21:58] <Demos[m]> if I have unit packages with the same name in multiple compunits and "need" them from a root unit module compunit (also the same name) then `use Module` does not import the package's exports while `need Module; import Module;` does

[22:32] <guifa> `use Foo` should get you the same results as `need Foo; import Foo`

[22:32] <Demos[m]> it doesn't

[22:33] <Demos[m]> it seems like `import` looks at the EXPORT package in whatever you point it to

[22:33] <Demos[m]> while `use` only looks at the export package in the compunit you hand it

[22:35] <guifa> so let me first make sure I understand what you're trying to do.  

[22:36] <guifa> You've got module Foo, let's say, with several symbols that it exports
