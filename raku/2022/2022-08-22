[08:14] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: Hi! I think I found a bug in rak... `rak '/"=>" \s* 0/ && !/nullable/'` of course it wouldn't work, but it doesn't give 
[08:14] <tellable6> 2022-08-20T00:09:51Z #raku <melezhik> SmokeMachine I have fixed sparrowhub.io queue, new builds should get triggered now
[08:14] <SmokeMachine> sorry
[08:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: Hi! I think I found a bug in rak... `rak '/"=>" \s* 0/ && !/nullable/'` of course it wouldn't work, but it doesn't give any error (probably because it starts and ends with /) but (of course) it doesn't do what I wanted... could it?
[08:16] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: and when I try `rak '{ /"=>" \s* 0/ && !/nullable/ }'` it dies... `Cannot resolve caller Bool(Nil:U: );`
[08:47] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: I hope that I will be able to release the next App::Rak before Wednesday, depending internally on the new plumbing, aka the "rak" module
[08:47] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/rak
[08:48] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure it will show new issues, so I'm not focussing on solving issues on the current (old) codebase 
[08:48] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: ok, thanks
[08:49] <lizmat> meanwhile, if you would want to check out whether it works with rak (you would have to make your own CLI)
[08:50] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: but do you think `'/regex1/ && !/regex2/'` should work?
[08:50] <lizmat> well, I don't see any reason it shouldn't (yet)
[08:51] <lizmat> when something starts and ends with a / , the string will be EVALled
[08:51] <SmokeMachine> or at least `'{ /regex1/ && !/regex2/ }'`
[08:51] <lizmat> as long as the EVAL works and something Callable comes of it, it should work afaics
[08:52] <SmokeMachine> really? that answers why it didn't die... but don't answer why I got the wrong result... :(
[08:52] <lizmat> there's some trickery involved if you also specified :ignorecase and/or :ignoremark
[08:52] <lizmat> (adding :i:m into the regex)
[08:57] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: changing the subject, sorry for so many tweets last week... I didn't want to increase your work for Rakudo weekly... if you prefer to leave some of my tweets out of it, I would understand...
[08:58] <lizmat> This time of year I worry more abourt lack of content than too much content   :-)   so the tweets were welcome to me :-)

[09:52] <lizmat> I tend not to mention modules without documentation in the Weekly  :-)
[09:52] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: that's a good choice in my opinion...
[09:54] <SmokeMachine> when I write some documentation I'll make a new release to let it be announced...
[09:54] <lizmat> okidoki!

[12:47] <ab5tract> ah, thanks SmokeMachine!
[13:03] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking... as we have: `@bla is List` would it make sense to be possible to do: `@bla are Int` and that be equivalent to: `@bla where *.are ~~ Int`?
[13:08] <lizmat> as in "my @bla are Int" ?
