[11:52] <Xliff> Is the closest rakudo equivalent to the JS '.each' method spelled 'for'?

[11:55] <moritz> .map I'd think?

[11:58] <jast> raku's .map would be equivalent to JS's .map I guess

[11:59] <jast> AFAIK JS doesn't even have a .each, except as provided by third party libraries :)

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> forEach is meant i think

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> each is jQuery maybe

[12:19] *** euandreh left
[12:44] *** abraxxa left
[12:47] <lizmat> if JS .each is anything like Perl each, I'd say .pairs ?

[12:47] <lizmat> which is actually the default if you iterate a hash

[13:00] *** derpydoo joined

[13:06] <Xliff> So would .each (jQuery) be for?

[13:09] <jast> probably. the only reason it's a method in jQuery is that that's the only way to do it there (or used to be, I don't know)

[14:06] <moritz> I think .each in jQuery correponds to raku's .map best

[14:06] <moritz> the built-in JS Array.map has some... weird things going on, I think?

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's pretty normal imo but not nearly as powerful as the Raku map

[14:13] *** frost16 left
[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> starting with the fact that it's only for Arrays and it doesn't work reliably when you try to steal it from the prototype for other structures

[14:47] *** derpydoo joined
[15:00] <tonyo> js Array.map has a lot more stuff than .map of raku

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yet it's less powerful, simply because JS has no concept of blocks

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> blocks as callable entities, that is

[15:11] <Nemokosch> today's nerve-crushing nonsense:

[15:11] <tellable6> 2022-10-15T21:32:04Z #raku <guifa_> nemokosch: that's a joke, there, I think.

[15:11] <tellable6> 2022-10-16T14:44:22Z #raku <guifa_> Nemokosch: there might be a bit way of testing supplies, but I figured the best way is to make the test file look like how people would use it

[15:11] <tellable6> 2022-10-18T23:29:25Z #raku <guifa_> Nemokosch: you just got an official cro update ;-)

[19:08] <massa> there was an spurious space somewhere

[19:08] <massa> I have to go...

[19:08] *** massa left
[19:20] <tonyo> haven't seen that name in a long time

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean yes, in front of `.comb` - that's the point

[19:23] <tonyo> the point was you had a syntax error with the space

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if `'asdfg'    .comb` works and `whatever.&dd` works, it's fair (and useful) to expect that `'asdfg'   .comb.&dd` should also work -`.&` is attached to the left argument as much as possible

[19:24] <tonyo> seems to work fine without syntax error

[19:24] <tonyo> m: sub XXX(|) { "xxx" };  (1..50).map({$_}).join\         .&XXX.&dd;

[19:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: ¬´"xxx"‚ê§¬ª

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> exactly - or we might say that the syntax had an error with the space üôÇ it's just a matter of perspective

[19:25] <tonyo> ah - i see your point
