[01:34] <ugexe> I wrote up a draft grant proposal for adding dependency lock file support to zef - https://gist.github.com/ugexe/b04f71e97fadbd3ae384e8ca73b42860

[01:46] <[Coke]> +1 from me.

[02:19] <ugexe> i still plan on investigating a grant to do configurable default $*REPO.repo-chain ala `RAKU_DEFAULT_REPO_CHAIN="inst#/foo" raku -e '.say for $*REPO.repo-chain'`, but I want to do this smaller lock file grant first

[03:13] <jaguart> the terminology in the grant was not clear to me - a lock file being something different from a uri that indicates where to source a dependency from

[03:14] <jaguart> or is the 'lock file' the equiv to an environment file in other languages?

[03:16] <jaguart> so I could have a dependency-origin-production.json and a dependency-origin-development.json

[03:20] <jaguart> and I guess you would have to handle the cases where the dependency is on x:auth<a>:ver<0.1.0+> but the dependency-origin is pinned to something different than that

[03:21] <jaguart> i.e. the dist at the uri is x:auth<b>:ver<0.0.1> etc

[03:22] *** xinming left
[03:22] *** xinming joined
[03:34] <jaguart> TIL that node developers use 'lock file' terminology in this way - meaning package-lock.json - and see stories of the CI challenges for package managers

[04:27] <ugexe> the problem of if the distribution at the end of a given source-url matches the correct data already exists

[04:31] <ugexe> to be clear the 'uri' field isn't technically needed for the most basic lock file. but it allows for tooling to implement other more complex things. for instance a tool might generate this lock file and create a folder where it saves all the distribution tar files to (setting the uri to these new local files)

[04:32] *** Kaiepi left
[04:34] <ugexe> it also means something like a checksum check could occur in that tool instead of me having to implement it as part of this :P

[04:35] *** Guest2998 left
[04:36] <ugexe> i agree calling it something other than a lock file is good though. cpanfile.snapshot is a perlish example 

[04:46] <jaguart> so you're not thinking developer sets the uri, but that uri is managed by tooling for caching etc?

[06:00] <jaguart> the Bool type unexpectedly reports two attributes with the same name and different types - is that a reporting bug? 

[06:00] <jaguart> m:  Bool.^attributes.say

[13:18] <guifa> Perhaps those attributes are coming from different  inheritances.  Private attributes aren't accessible from subclasses or roles

[17:22] <melezhik> I wonder if TPRF accepts grants this year, yet ?

[17:22] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm no longer on the Grant Committee... so I wouldn't know

[17:25] <melezhik> I mean I saw ugexe drafts, that made me think maybe I would try to propose something from myself, or this one is intended to another auditory ?

[19:34] <guifa> I believe so, codesections is more in tune with that stuff

[19:36] <guifa> jaguart see the following

[19:36] <guifa> m: class a { has $!x = 0 }; class b is a { has $!x = 1 }; b.new.^attributes.say

[19:40] <codesections> .tell melezhik I believe that TPRF grants should be accepting grants.  I know that the previous grant chair stepped down and there's been a bit of a transition period, but AFAIK they're accepting grant applications as normal

[19:40] <tellable6> codesections, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[20:03] <MitarashiDango[m> It looks like prove6 on the Rakudo Star Docker images no longer runs due to missing dependencies. Do they need to be added here? https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/43ecfe0ea64e0a2686f390fc112f2f2d5f8df836/etc/modules.txt ? The missing deps look to be Path::Finder, Pod::Usage, and sigpipe.
