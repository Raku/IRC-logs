[00:00] <guifa_> question is the classic counting one: is * and × one operator with two forms?  Or two separate operators that map identically internally?

[00:02] <guifa_> also yikes, that table got sorted alphabetically!

[00:06] <habere-et-disper> Thanks guifa_. Can anyone recommend a coding typeface which has ligature support for raku? FiraCode comes close but needs set support.

[09:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ~~you copied my solution~~

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> come on, that shift is not nice at all at the end...

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> It iterates just nicely, as it should.

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean it works but I'd go as far as to say you won't find anyone who finds this loop better than an immutable for loop

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's not idempotent in the first place

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> I could define an infix ofc and then hyper it. However, the hyper would do exactly the same thing under the hood.

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, you could

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> don't kill the hope that it can eventually operate better 😅

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> like any hope for parallelization is gone with these mutable operations

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Hypers don't forward adverbs to the infix. :-/

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do adverbs even belong to the operator or they are just arguments?

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> They do, or %foo<somekey>:exists would not work.

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> sure? idk what the syntax is, it could still be a part of the signature

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> when I see something like this, I would think that it's just an argument that has some syntax magic that allows it to go right after the closing bracket

[14:14] <guifa_> Operator adverbs were one of those things that were a super cool idea, but outside of the circumfixes, never really seemed to pick up too terribly much use

[14:18] <guifa_> 10 / 3 :int; # result 3

[14:18] <guifa_> ^^ could have been a possible use

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but that would require syntax black magic again, no?

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> eh, I guess if an infix could take more than one argument on the left, it should work

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> right*

[14:20] <lizmat> m: multi sub infix:</>($a, $b, :int!) { $a div $v }; say 10 / 3 :int

[14:21] <lizmat> m: multi sub infix:</>($a, $b, :$int!) { $a div $v }; say 10 / 3 :int

[14:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75fa35e40: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable '$v' is not declared.  Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this was␤intended to be part of a signature?␤at <tmp>:1␤------>  sub infix:</>($a, $b, :$int!) { $a div ⏏$v }; say 10 / 3 :int…»

[14:21] <lizmat> m: multi sub infix:</>($a, $b, :$int!) { $a div $b }; say 10 / 3 :int

[14:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75fa35e40: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[14:21] <lizmat> :-)

[14:22] <lizmat> no black magic needed

[14:24] <guifa_> One could also imagine for any math operators are a precision and/or width adverb

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that "subscript adverb" is kinda hacky though

[14:24] <guifa_> It actually follows all the rules of the adverb

[14:24] <guifa_> you have an operator

[14:24] <guifa_> and an adverb

[14:24] <guifa_> adverb gets passed to the operator

[14:25] <guifa_> (remember, [ … ] is an operator in Raku, not specialized syntax )

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, that makes sense

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> []:exists, though, is something that doesn't follow from the rules of an operator

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> [:exists] would

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> similarly to m:g// instead of m/:g/

[15:31] <guifa_> is there any tidy way to do a join but keeping things list-y?

[15:32] <guifa_> like my @a = <a b c>; @b = @a.join(' + '); such that @b is ['a', ' + ', 'b', ' + ', 'c'] ?

[15:35] <gfldex> m: my @a = <a b c>; my @b = (@a Z (' + ' xx *)).head(*-1); dd @b;

[15:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9c90bc79: OUTPUT: «Array @b = [("a", " + "), ("b", " + ")]␤»

[15:35] <gfldex> m: my @a = <a b c>; my @b = (@a Z (' + ' xx *)).flat.head(*-1); dd @b;

[15:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9c90bc79: OUTPUT: «Array @b = ["a", " + ", "b", " + ", "c"]␤»

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I was rather thinking of a reduction

[15:40] <guifa_> meh.  I'll just build a sub for it 

[15:40] <guifa_> I'm having to change some actions frmo just string building (where join works perfectly) to generating a list of mostly strings, but a few things that stringify based on various settings

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it doesn't stop bugging me, though 🙂

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> can functions return (quasi) anonymous operators? that is, can something returned from a function and generated "on the fly" have associativity assigned?

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay, I'm still curious if that works but it won't help a lot

[15:55] <tellable6> 2022-07-29T08:35:03Z #raku <jjatria> Nemokosch: I guess that's the big question: is the fact that even in a "trusted" ecosystem anyone can "hijack" a distribution a feature or a bug? 

[15:55] <tellable6> 2022-07-29T12:07:01Z #raku <ugexe> Nemokosch: its all very intentional and somewhat related to the dbic ownership problem from years ago, not "for the lolz"

[15:55] <tellable6> 2022-07-29T13:02:34Z #raku <lucs> Nemokosch: Thanks too.

[15:55] <tellable6> 2022-07-29T18:56:33Z #raku <japhb> Nemokosch: Better to ping me directly from IRC.  irssi (my IRC client) doesn't highlight anything the bridge bot says, so I can easily miss stuff.  (And this channel is too chatty to read everything all the time.)

[15:56] <Nemokosch> seems like the return is needed

[15:57] <Nemokosch> guifa_: what do you think?

[15:59] <guifa_> it's definitely a way to do it.  I think to do the associativity you'd ultimately need to use EVAL or RAST

[16:00] <Nemokosch> it looked like it didn't explicitly refuse sub (...) is assoc<list>

[16:00] <Nemokosch> but I realized that it wouldn't get me closer to a solution

[16:01] <guifa_> I just ultimately did sub list-join(@x,$y) { my @z = @x.head[]; append @z: |$y, |$_ for @x.skip(1); @z }

[16:02] <guifa_> Since I'm refactoring code, being able to say @foo.join --> @foo.&list-join makes life easier

[16:03] <Nemokosch> > append @z: |$y, |$_

[16:03] <Nemokosch> oh, this is a method call. You are probably the first one that I see using this syntax

[16:04] <guifa_> I think it reveals some of my perl background

[16:04] <guifa_> haha

[16:05] <guifa_> for instance, in Perl you'd say push @list, $element

[16:06] <guifa_> Most of the time in Raku you see @list.push($element) or @list.push: $element

[16:06] <Nemokosch> it's unusual for me, that's for sure :D

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> yes yes :p\p

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure why I didn't remember this was your presentation, almost sure I've seen it

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> it is an amazing presentation i think, thank you for it, i learned \*a lot\* from it

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> maybe i forgot a lot, too, but still

[16:11] <guifa_> I just love that  the powers that be back in the day really realized the utility in not really strictly distinguishing methods from subs

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> as someone who raises issues almost every day, I would be a bit wary with that "unsurprising" there 😅

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, these are the last days of pondering whether I can define and compile a presentation (other than the lightning talk) for the conference

[16:16] <guifa_> I'm going to redo my module one, but touch it up a bit

[16:16] <guifa_> I definitely noticed one or two things I forgot during it

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's cool; it really was my main source to even start with modules

[16:18] <guifa_> I'm never doing three talks in one conference again though lol, that was stressful

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What I still fail to decide is whether the presentation should have a strict structure or it could be mainly driven by my sheer "Raku journey" in the last year

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, I've seen at least one from Ruth, maybe two even

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the first one, now that was definitely fun for someone who knows nothing about Perl, too xD

[16:20] <guifa_> She's great.  Actually was the first person from the conference I saw when I walked in, and made me feel super welcome there

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my private jet hadn't arrived so I could go to that conference :DD
