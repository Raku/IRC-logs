[09:12] <ToddAndMargo> NativeCall question.Â  When I get back a C pointer to a 32bit DWORD (uint32), how do I translate the pointer to the value it points to?

[09:22] <nine> ToddAndMargo: assuming $p is a Pointer[uint32], it's just $p.deref

[09:25] <ToddAndMargo> No such method 'deref' for invocant of type 'Int'

[09:25] <ToddAndMargo> Â Â  my CPOINTER $HandleÂ Â  = 0;Â  # use .deref to extract the value

[09:26] <ToddAndMargo> constant CPOINTER := uint32;

[09:26] <nine> That's not a pointer at all then

[09:28] <ToddAndMargo> that would explain some things

[17:52] <simcop2387> Hey, because I'm a weird kind of hoarder, and because I'm working on setting up a system for us perl5 folks on perl.social, I've gone and grabbed raku.social too.  If anyone wants it for a real purpose let me know and i'll transfer it along.  otherwise i'm just gonna keep it for a while until i remember i have it and decide that i don't want it anymore.  i'll also check back once i have the perl

[17:52] <simcop2387> one running and see if you people here might want me to stand up the same kind of thing too.  perl one is going to be activitypub based twitter/facebook replacement because i don't trust twitter to not be going freenode anymore.

[17:54] <simcop2387> Current stack is using Friendica for the main web parts and Keycloak for user management and authentication (gives better MFA support, and can end up giving better tools for moderators/support in the future)

[18:08] <Voldenet> Sorry to disappoint, but twitter is not going to end up like freenode

[18:08] <Voldenet> â€¦after all freenode still exists in some form :>

[18:09] <simcop2387> yea i don't expect it to completely collapse but i do expect it to be unnaturally chaotic for a decent amount of time after all this, you know just like freenode :)
