[00:09] <Voldenet> True, but I find it more convenient

[00:09] <Voldenet> m: enum Alpha <A B C D>; role NextFrom[&E] does Positional { method AT-POS ($k) { $k < self.elems ?? (nextsame) !! E() }; }; my $a = (A, B, C, D) but NextFrom[{Alpha.pick}]; $a[^10].say; $a[^10].say

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Crazy xD

[00:14] <Voldenet> Crazy? It's not even my final form

[12:10] <tbrowder> .ask El_Che how can i set up debian sudo so it will run raku and zef for a user with either a rakudo-pkg installation or an official raku and zef package installation? i am having no luck with various combinations of path settings in various places (i'm next going to try one of lower level  sudo system input files for another way to set paths for the sudu user)

[13:47] <guifa> rjbs at least in the managerial role you know how to code.  I've talked to SO MANY PEOPLE lately who are leads who have never coded before.  I'm like, wait, what?   Corporatization at its best, I guess

[15:26] <rjbs> I think a non-coder can be a good manager for a coder. Just requires certain kinds of trust to work.
