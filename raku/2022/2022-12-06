[12:59] <tbrowder> hi, question on class construction: if every instance of a class has one attribute having the same value for the same attribute, does raku optimze that somehow so there is only one copy in memory?

[12:59] <tbrowder> *optimize

[13:02] *** jpn left
[13:07] <moritz> the short answer is: probably not

[13:08] <moritz> the long answer is that raku's object model distinguishes between class behavior (controlled by the meta class) and storage management

[13:09] <moritz> for example when doing nativecall integration, it's pretty important that objects are layed out in memory like C structs, so there's a separate NativeCallHOW or so for that

[13:09] <moritz> and I don't think the default storage layout engine has such an optimization, but you could write your own that does

[13:09] <moritz> m: class A {}; say A.HOW

[13:50] <tbrowder> hi, moritz, Merry Christmas. i'm definitely not interested in writing my own.

[13:52] <tbrowder> i thought i remembered something about a "static" field that was the same for all objects of a class. i know static is not the right term.

[13:52] <tbrowder> i couldn't find it in the docs

[13:54] *** frost joined
[13:55] <moritz> you can just declare it with `my` on the class level

[16:33] <SmokeMachine> it seems another advent calendar post was published together with the current one...

[16:36] <SmokeMachine> what should be done?

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> more like your post got shadowed

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ohh, now it at least shows under https://raku-advent.blog/2022/

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: that's the smallestt problem IMHO... there are 2 posts for the same day...

[16:39] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> previously I could only find it using the "previous post" button from the other post

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> that's the biggest problem... we already have a small number of posts... if we post 2 at the same day...

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hey, what if we are just rich like that? üòÇ

[16:40] <SmokeMachine> I'm thinking on trying to reschedule that...

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> on a more serious tone. No idea what happened, no idea how the calendar is handled and no idea whom to notify and how. Perhaps JJ but how?

[16:43] <SmokeMachine> my post wasn't scheduled, but when I saw that today no post was published (the posts should be scheduled for 00:00, at 07:00 there was no new post), then I published mine, to not open a hole...

[16:43] <SmokeMachine> JJ is on vacation...

[16:44] <SmokeMachine> maybe this one was scheduled for the wrong time...

[16:44] <nine> Or maybe a time zone problem?

[16:45] *** silug left
[16:45] <SmokeMachine> nine: yes, maybe...

[16:45] *** simcop2387 joined
[16:45] <SmokeMachine> what to do?

[16:45] <SmokeMachine> it seems I have no permission to do anything...

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Good for you that you know it at all that JJ is on vacation lol. Not sure how one should figure these things out.

[16:46] *** silug joined
[16:47] *** perlbot joined
[16:47] <SmokeMachine> before I published my post, I sent JJ a message on twitter, he agreed with me that any post would be better than no post and told me he was on vacation.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That's fair.

[16:48] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking on trying to reschedule that post for tomorrow... but it seems 

[16:49] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking on trying to reschedule that post for tomorrow... but it seems there are other 7 posts scheduled (I can't see what or to when)...

[16:50] <SmokeMachine> I don't have permission to see or to change anything...

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> does lizmat know something about this maybe?

[16:52] <SmokeMachine> idk... maybe... lizmat ?

[16:52] <lizmat> yes, I can do stuff.. what needs to be done?

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> otherwise, I'd just say benevolent accidents do happen every now and then, it's not the end of the world to repost the article once we've run out

[16:54] <lizmat> SmokeMachine what needs to be done?   Remove yours, or Wim's ?

[16:55] *** abraxxa joined
[16:55] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I really don't know. I don't want to harm mine nor Wim's

[16:56] <lizmat> ok, I've converted yours to draft now

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> ok, thanks

[16:56] <lizmat> the reason: Wim's is in raw HTML, and I didn't see a quick way to see the date

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> will mine be published any other time?

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> or that was it?

[16:57] <lizmat> I'm looking at what would be the best solution  :-)

[16:57] <lizmat> the easiest would be to reschedule it for the 12th

[16:57] <SmokeMachine> and sorry for the confusion... I was just trying to help to not let the advent without a post for a day...

[16:57] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: is that ok with you ?

[16:58] <SmokeMachine> sure

[16:58] <lizmat> ok, then I'll reschedule for the 12th  :-)

[16:58] <SmokeMachine> again, I'm sorry for that

[16:58] <lizmat> no worries...  stuff happens  :-)

[17:00] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: if you feel you need to polish your blog, you have a few days to do so :-)

[17:00] <SmokeMachine> thanks... that's a good idea... it is really needed
