[01:37] <ShaneC> is there a way to get nicely formatted .raku output?

[01:45] <guifa> ShaneC: you might try Data::Dump

[01:45] <guifa> https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/Data::Dump

[01:46] <guifa> Also https://raku.land/github:nkh/Data::Dump::Tree 

[01:46] <guifa> (despite the similar names, they're two separate modules)

[01:53] <ShaneC> thanks

[16:20] <tonyo> oh, if you're all set then i may take a bit more time to finish the article (for the sake of completeness)

[16:22] <tbrowder> great, lots of stuff in there i can use, esp. session management, template use, and oauth2--great job, thanks!

[16:24] <tonyo> no problem, there may be some bugs..i was looking through last night and i think maybe CIAvash is right about the encode-percents need the `()`, the oauth stuff can be ported to any provider and probably should just be a module for Cro
