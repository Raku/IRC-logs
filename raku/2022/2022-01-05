[10:20] <moon-child> wh-wh-what?
[10:21] <moon-child> I mean ... if you want <[0..9]>, it's very easy to write <[0..9]>

[10:25] <MasterDuke> well, it's 6 more chars to type than \d
[10:26] <MasterDuke> and 8 more keypresses (on a US keyboard at least)
[10:27] <moon-child> Sure.  How many characters is the regex for what \d is equivalent to?
[10:28] <moon-child> also: supposing you need a lot of ascii decimals.  Then you can say  my regex d { <[0..9]> }  and then refer to  <d>,  which is only one more character
[10:31] <MasterDuke> i'm not as sure as that blog post that \d matching unicode digits is going to cause a ton of bugs and security vulnerabilities, but i wouldn't have objected to \d just matching <[0..9]> either and instead having something else for all digits
[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Welcome to a world where ASCII is still highly overrepresented as a norm ðŸ˜†
[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Really, just to name a few development-related products, gyp, Android Studio and Lazarus are broken if I just try to use them at a normal place on my Windows system
[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> to be fair, I don't think Unix even allows you to rely on non-ASCII folders - but if Windows allows this by default with no warnings whatsoever and people keep doing this, it's more than desirable that software tools in the 2020's handle this correctly
[10:58] <moon-child> what is 'unix'?
[10:58] <moon-child> most unices I know of treat paths as nul-terminated strings of octets
[10:58] <moon-child> they do not care whether those octets represent ascii characters or not
[10:59] <moritz_> most OSes (or their userland tools) that I have worked with do try to render path names into characters at some point
[10:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> maybe this is a GNU/Linux thing then
[11:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik#7370> This guy does not understand they are lot of people using no ascii char (China + India is half the mondial population?)

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> all distros I've tried to install made it clear very quickly that they want a traditional \s+ string for the username
[11:28] <moritz_> that must really suck, having to learn another script just to be able to pick a login name :-(
[11:28] <moritz_> though some display managers show the full name when logging in, at least

[12:27] <CIAvash> ASCII users can solve their problem by using basic Latin: `[<?:Block('Basic Latin')> \d]+`
[13:03] *** holyghost_ joined
[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, tbh the problem is using the same tools for parsing generic unicode text and IP addresses....
[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and still no proper mentions of the "vulnerabilities"
[13:06] *** holyghost left
[13:07] <moon-child> ip addresses have a very specific specification, in terms of ascii.  Whatever spec will say 'an ascii digit (0-9)', and if I were implementing such a specification, I would use <[0..9]> to make it clear how the grammar corresponds to the spec, even if \d were ascii-only

[17:59] <tonyo> is PTS going this year?
[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is PTS?
[18:04] <tonyo> perl toolchain summit
[18:06] <Voldenet> 0x7F.0x00.0x00.0x01, 0177.0000.0000.0001 and 2130706433 are all valid representations of the same ip
[18:06] <Voldenet> i wish it wasn't true

[18:09] <lizmat> tonyo: no idea, but I guess this is the wrong channel to ask  :-)
[18:09] <holyghost_> You couldn't play games on OS/2 :-)
[18:10] <lizmat> tonyo: fwiw, when in person events are a thing again, I would love to organize a RTS  :-)
[18:10] *** holyghost_ is now known as holyghost
[18:10] <tonyo> lizmat: really bummed i missed the last one, i was in israel - so close but so far
[18:12] <lizmat> The one in Marlow, yeah.  It was eventful indeed
[18:13] <lizmat> 2020 was officially cancelled, I don't think 2021 was ever announced, nor has 2022 afaik
[18:18] <tonyo> ahh bummer, is ovid still running those?
[18:20] <lizmat> ovid was never running them, book was afaik?
[18:21] <lizmat> and the last one was mostly run by Neil Bowers?
[18:27] <tonyo> ah

[19:02] <guifa> moon-child I actually double checked the RFC on IP addresses.  unlike virtually every other RFC i've seen, there's no strict definition for the textual representation of them
[19:02] <guifa> (there is, however, for the binary representation)
[19:04] <guifa> Interestingly, the one for IPv6 exclusively uses capital letters, but in practice, I only see folks use lowercase.  To me, an western Arabic 3 vs an eastern Arabic Ù£ is no larger distinction than a lower f and an uppercase F in terms of text processing.

[19:51] <El_Che> guifa: my programs often have a normalize function for IPs and mac addresses :)
[19:52] <guifa> El_Che exactly. In fact, I could almost envision programs that normalize data being potentially more secure.  Someone has actually taken care to think about potentially junk data and handling it
[19:53] * guifa emphasizes could almost envision (statement not to be taken as endorsing anything other than rigorously tested code as being considered secure lol)
