[05:12] <moon-child> there's a 'partition' function, right?

[05:13] <moon-child> given <1 3 1 1 2 4 3 4>, I want [[1, 1, 1], [2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]

[05:13] <moon-child> (though in no particular order)

[05:23] <moon-child> gonna ask again cuz it probably god lost in the flood: is there a standard function for partitioning?

[05:23] <moon-child> e.g. given <1 3 1 1 2 4 3 4>, I want [[1, 1, 1], [2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]

[07:49] <moon-child> moritz_: I want more complex objects, though, with custom comparators

[07:49] <moon-child> i.e. the objects that belong to a given partition aren't actually the same as each other

[07:50] <moritz_> can you sort them?

[07:50] <moritz_> and/or hash them?

[07:50] <moon-child> yeah

[07:51] <moritz_> my %h; %h{.hashed}.push: $_ for @your-objects

[07:51] <moon-child> oh, I was looking for 'categorize'

[07:52] <moon-child> or 'classify'
