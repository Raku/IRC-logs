[12:51] <lizmat> interesting...  :-)
[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat How did you write the "Don't fear the grepper articles", directly in DEV.to ?
[12:56] <lizmat> no, I wrote them first in vim, and then pasted the markdown into dev.to for tweaking
[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see. Are the Markdown files available somewhere? Basically this is why I am scraping DEV.to -- to get the Markdown versions of your posts.

[13:41] <lizmat> moritz: suppose I want to see if a string contains *any* character that has an additional marker, like é
[13:41] <lizmat> thinking about adding a --smartmark option to rak
[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what use case do you have in mind?
[13:48] <lizmat> same use case as --smartcase
[13:49] <lizmat> if the pattern does *not* contain any such characters, activate --ignoremark
[13:49] <lizmat> if it does, assume exact matching is required, so don't activate that
[13:53] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&
[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, that makes sense actually
[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for "fűtő", "futo" should match but not "futó"

[14:18] <moritz> lizmat: if you are looking for any character with a mark, the canonical implementation would be to use a decomposed normal form, and then check any character if they belong to the COMBINING MARK family(?), though I don't know if/how raku supports that

[14:47] <tbrowder> hi, all. yesterday i wondered if we might use dev.to as a raku advent site on our own servers. the several answers were basically no, self-hosting is not sustainable. 
[14:50] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]
[14:52] *** xinming left
[14:52] <tbrowder> my question, though, was not fully answered because i was also referring to it’s much easier editing capability and whether its presentation could be satisfactory for the advent articles. if so, perhaps we can search for a satisfactory hosting solution.
[14:53] <tbrowder> to me it sounds like it might be something the raku foundation might support.

[18:48] * [Coke]_ finally gives up on 5g home internet and switches back to cable (holy moley is it faster)
[18:48] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]
[18:49] <[Coke]> went from an average of 45Mbps (with a worst case of 45Kbps for a day or so) to a one time peak of 410Mbps.
[18:49] <lizmat> moritz: thanks for your thoughts:  I think the easiest would be to create an NFD of the string, and see if the number of element is difference from the number of chars in the string
[18:49] <El_Che> the summary of the story is that 5G sucks on your location
[18:50] <[Coke]> Was "fine" for 10 months but has been horribly recently. I suspect they let too many people on the local tower.
[18:51] <El_Che> even 4G is a lot faster around here
[18:51] <El_Che> but, indeed cable seems like a better idea
[18:53] <lizmat> cable is ok, unless they put too many people on a local hub  :-)
[18:54] * lizmat is glad with 1Gbps up/down physically
[18:54] <El_Che> there she is
[18:54] <El_Che> :)
[18:54] <lizmat> where am I ?
[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yep yep
[18:55] <El_Che> somewhere with symmetric 1gpbs cable
[18:55] <lizmat> ah, true..  though throttled to 500 Mbps to keep cost down
[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 1 Gbps down still feels kinda overkill most of the time
[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but the upload is only like 40M
[18:56] <El_Che> I need to wait for fiber for symmetric speeds
[18:56] <lizmat> well, I run several servers here  :-)
[18:59] <El_Che> our local cable company (that was sold to the US) only gives 300/20 and 1000/40 for too much money
[19:00] <El_Che> for less you'd get 1000/1000 on fiber, but it's not available everywhere yet :/

[22:15] <tbrowder> if anyone is interested in trying out a self-hosted DEV (dev.to) server  for supporting raku-advent.blog i'll provide a small Linode cloud shared server to use as a test bed. you'll get full access to a freshly-installed Debian 11 server. i  don't have time to do it myself, but having a couple of energetic raku ppl as a team would be nice. send me a private msg if interested.
