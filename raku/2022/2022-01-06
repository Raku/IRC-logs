[11:43] <Skarsnik> http://blogs.perl.org/users/sylvain_colinet/2022/01/writing-a-snes-assembler-compilerdisassembler---day-4.html for bored people x)

[11:49] <Skarsnik> I wonder if I should group these post when I am done

[12:07] <Skarsnik> Probably a dumb question: How to store ref to objects? using := ? or = does not clone?

[12:08] <lizmat> an object is already a ref, really

[12:08] <lizmat> when you say: my $a = 42

[12:09] <lizmat> you're creating a Scalar object bound to the local lexpad, and bind the Int.new(42) object to the $!value attribute of the Scalar object

[12:09] <lizmat> basically

[12:10] <El_Che> The first thing to unlearn for me was the use of references in perl

[12:10] <Skarsnik> I mean, I have @allthings and I want to build a @thingstofix where the things are not copy in this

[12:14] <Skarsnik> m: my @t = (0..4); my @p; @p[0] = @t[2]; @p[0] = 42; say @t"

[12:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3aa23bf9b: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Two terms in a row‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> my @p; @p[0] = @t[2]; @p[0] = 42; say @t‚èè"‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        infix‚ê§        infix stopper‚ê§        postfix‚ê§        statement end‚ê§‚Ä¶¬ª

[12:14] <Skarsnik> m: my @t = (0..4); my @p; @p[0] = @t[2]; @p[0] = 42; say @t

[12:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3aa23bf9b: OUTPUT: ¬´[0 1 2 3 4]‚ê§¬ª

[12:15] <Skarsnik> Ok, so I need to := when affecting to @p

[12:18] <lizmat> yes, and you might find this interesting: https://opensource.com/article/18/8/containers-perl-6

[12:22] <Skarsnik> Thank, it's starting to became a strain to work with too much language x)

[12:42] <tbrowder> happy new year, rakuuns, i hope to see some of you in houston in june at us raku conference

[12:44] <lizmat> tbrowder o/   hope you'll have a great time there

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't think I would make it to Houston but glhf in advance üòÑ

[12:49] *** jjido joined
[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyways, for the "language speedrun" article... I learned the lesson

[12:52] *** razetime left
[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if I ever write an article about Raku, I will call the behavior of "list assignment" a "bug"

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> maybe that would make an impact xD

[12:53] *** razetime joined
[12:55] <lizmat> hehe... :-)

[12:55] <lizmat> in that case, I might actually agree  :-)

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Probably not the first time that I bring this up but the overall behavior of @variables seems troublesome

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> We have people asking about Int @sth every week

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there are very serious anti-dwim things with the @ sigil

[13:15] <Skarsnik> passing @ to a routine is always something... weird

[13:16] <Skarsnik> my wish was for a pragma/whatever that enforce Raku to check for type when you specify then, even in method call x)

[13:19] <moon-child> m: class A { method f(Int $x) {} }; class B is A { method f($x) {} }; my A $x = B.new; $x.f('bubbles')

[13:19] <evalable6> moon-child, rakudo-moar 8275e9160: OUTPUT: ¬´¬ª

[13:19] <moon-child> Skarsnik: ^^ is the problem with something like that

[13:20] <moon-child> (and this is why I suggest using multis over methods)

[13:20] *** camelia joined
[13:20] *** camelia left
[13:20] <Skarsnik> I guess it's a tricky thing

[13:20] *** camelia joined
[13:21] <Skarsnik> related, can you do multi in a child class from a parent class that was not multi now?

[13:21] <moon-child> yes

[13:22] <Skarsnik> I remember having this issue when wanting to add some specific debug option in User::Agent a long time ago x)

[13:23] <Skarsnik> can you do circular deps now, or it's still NYI because too much issue in precomp?

[13:25] <MasterDuke> you just have to forward declare one of the deps

[13:27] <Skarsnik> I had this issue when writing a Discord module (user are in channels, channel contains users) and trying to generate the libxml binding in multiple files (can't fw declare for native stuff)

[17:26] <[Coke]> NYI makes it sound like it's on the roadmap. I think it's just not implemented.

[17:33] <moon-child> my primary association with 'NYI', at least in fairly mature projects, is 'this is gonna be a pain to implement and people don't really need it that badly, soo ... we're probably gonna get to it.  Eventually'

[17:34] <[Coke]> it's just literally not yet implemented, which implies the intent *is* to do it.

[17:34] <[Coke]> but yes, that's a reason why it's often "not yet"

[17:43] <[Coke]> Sorry, not trying to coke-splain. Just wanted to underscore that I don't think anyone is planning to make it work. :)

[17:49] * japhb imagines a Pepsi rolling its eyes at Coke-splaining -- "Yes, we all know what cola is, thank you.  Yes, we all know about your original formula ...."

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Pepsi just doesn't taste like something you'd want to give real money for üòÑ
