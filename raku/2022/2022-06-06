[05:21] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> hi, has someone experienced died with exception when trying to access webpages? I can put this http://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/webproxy/DataFeedProxy.aspx?Subsystem=History&Action=GetDataSeries&Instrument=HEX24321&FromDate=2018-11-11&ToDate=2018-12-14 into my firefox and I get an XML response back instantly, but with Cro the HTTP::Client get timeouts 
[05:26] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> fetching other websites seems to work though
[05:41] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> with LWP::Simple it works similarly, just freezes and does nothing

[08:52] <Voldenet> sienet_ja_LSD[m]: this address doesn't respond if you don't use proper browser headers - it needs User-Agent, Accept-Language and Connection headers to work

[10:05] <Voldenet> >my $resp = await Cro::HTTP::Client.get("‚Ä¶", user-agent => "Mozilla/5.0", headers => [Accept-Language => "en", Connection => "keep-alive", Accept => "*/*"]);
[10:05] <Voldenet> try this
[10:07] <Voldenet> I think using instance of the client will set `Connection: keep-alive` by default
[10:08] <Voldenet> Nope, they don't
[10:10] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> hmm now it's complaining about ampersands in the url
[10:11] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> parameters aren't passed as they ought to
[10:13] <Voldenet> https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-client#Adding_query_string_parameters
[10:23] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> nope, still malformed utf-8
[10:25] <Voldenet> consider CRO_TRACE=1, then
[10:25] <Voldenet> tho this service sounds like a pain to work with
[10:25] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> perl5 works, but trying to use v5 errors No compiler available for Raku v5
[10:26] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> I got it working with full headers
[10:26] <Voldenet> don't be too surprised when they add js challenge to it :/
[10:35] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> maybe the output is actually non-utf8 although all fronts say that it is supposedly utf8
[10:35] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> this says the same: use LWP::Simple; my %headers = ('User-Agent' => 'Mozilla/4.76 [en] (Win98; U)', 'Accept-Language' => 'en-US', 'Accept-Charset' => 'iso-8859-1,*,utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding' => 'gzip', 'Accept' => "image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*"); my $content =

[10:37] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> those same headers get an XML response with p5
[10:47] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> so I guess use v5; doesn't work? or?

[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I noticed a mistake
[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > But you can also use a zen slice and the :v adverb:
[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The example does not contain zen slicing, according to the docs
[12:47] *** jgaz joined
[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> "Zen slicing is different from passing a Whatever-star (which, like a normal slice, always returns a List of elements no matter the type of the original object) or an empty list (which returns an empty slice):"
[12:50] <Voldenet> zen slice would still work though, right?
[12:50] <Voldenet> m: my @a; @a[3] = 42; @a[5] = 666; say @a[]:v;
[12:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4e8b671a: OUTPUT: ¬´(42 666)‚ê§¬ª
[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> seems like that
[12:58] <Voldenet> btw, in the example whatever-star also returns list
[13:02] <gfldex> m: multi sub infix:<M>(\l, \r) { l.tail eqv r ?? l !! slip(l,r) }; multi sub infix:<M>(\l, Mu:U \r) { l }; my @a = <a a b c c d e e e>; my \foo = lazy gather for @a -> $l, $r? { take $l M $r }; dd [M] <a a b c c d e e e>;
[13:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar d4e8b671a: OUTPUT: ¬´slip("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")‚ê§¬ª
[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@297037173541175296> if you use operators (or inline a block), you can even get lazy.
