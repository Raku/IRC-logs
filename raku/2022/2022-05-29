[16:42] <Newb> Hi, I installed zef but am getting "command not found" when I try to use it. I'm on a M1 mac. Anything I'm missing?

[16:48] <CIAvash> Newb: How did you install it? Is it in your `$PATH`?

[16:49] <Newb> I used the  raku -I. bin/zef install . command.

[16:49] <Newb> Regarding my $PATH, i'm a a super newb ha. Is that the bashrc file?

[16:50] <perryprog> the $PATH is basically the list of places your shell will look in for a specific program

[16:50] <perryprog> For macOS it'll be set in either your .profile or I think your ~/.zshenv

[16:50] <perryprog> The former is more reliable

[16:50] <perryprog> Let me install it on my new M1 computer (still getting it set up) and I'll let you know what I see

[16:52] <Newb> If I run echo $PATH or  lookt at ~/.zshenv it is in neither.

[16:53] <perryprog> huh, looks like brew install rakudo doesn't include zef

[16:53] <CIAvash> I think you should add `~/.raku/bin/` to your `PATH`. It can be set in different places. Is it in your .bashrc file? or `.profile` or `.bash_profile`

[16:54] <perryprog> CIAvash, default shell on macOS is zsh now

[16:54] <perryprog> but if it's installed from homebrew (as I just did) it looks like zef isn't installed at all

[16:55] <CIAvash> I missed the mac part

[16:56] <perryprog> it's just installing via rakudo-2022.04.tar.gz from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/tag/2022.04...

[16:56] <perryprog> weird

[17:01] <CIAvash> I think only the binary releases include zef

[17:04] <CIAvash> Newb: do you see zef if you run `ls ~/.raku/bin/`

[17:08] <Newb> .raku only has one directory called "short"

[17:08] <Newb> no bin

[17:10] <Newb> .rakubrew has a bin though

[17:10] <Newb> but no zef in it.

[17:12] <CIAvash> yes, as you mentioned previously you installed zef manually, with rakubrew run `rakubrew build-zef`. and `rakubrew init` for instructions

[17:15] <[Coke]> how can I splice a list? 

[17:15] <[Coke]> must I convert it to an Array first?

[17:22] <Newb> So I ran rakubrew build-zef and still have the same problem. But now I found zef and I can run it just be directly calling the path. So do I just add an alias of some sort that runs that path?

[17:24] <CIAvash> did you also run `rakubrew init` for instructions?

[17:24] <Newb> I just did that and it worked. Not sure if this was the right way.

[17:24] <Newb> I ran rakubrew init and added the things they asked me to.

[17:24] <Newb> But its working now, ha now that I added the alias.

[17:26] <Newb> So to be clear, I ran rakubrew init and it did not work, but then added the alias and now it is working.

[17:26] <Newb> Thanks for you help. Sorry for the newbness.

[17:34] <CIAvash> [Coke]: I think so, splice takes only arrays apparently plus splice mutates and List is immutable

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oh come on, I have seen much worse 😅

[19:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Overall we have learned a lot from it, pretty much everyone in their own way

[19:18] <lizmat> which reminds me I need to look at that bug :-)

[19:20] <perryprog> The fun thing about documentation issues is they're basically never wrong. If it's made on confusion about what something does, then it's clearly right since at least one person was confused by it :)

[19:20] <perryprog> It's like the public speaking tip when you're reading from a script: if you stumble over a part of your writing then it (possibly) means the wording can be improved.

[23:50] <coleman> Does piping zef to less behave strangely for anyone else?

[23:50] <coleman> `zef --help | less`; try pressing j and k after.

[23:52] <coleman> for me, it doesn't "page"; it disappears after pressking k
