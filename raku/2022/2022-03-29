[08:21] <floppy_disk> I'm planning to implement a toy programming language in Raku, how should I name the module?

[08:23] <El_Che> woody

[08:24] <El_Che> bobeep

[08:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> xD

[08:29] <floppy_disk> lol

[08:30] <floppy_disk> I meant the namespace I should put it in

[08:32] <El_Che> woody::

[08:32] <El_Che> bobeep::

[08:32] <El_Che> :P

[08:33] <moon-child> floppy_disk: slartibartfast

[08:34] <floppy_disk> heh

[08:34] <moon-child> really, it isn't important

[08:38] <floppy_disk> I see

[08:38] <floppy_disk> well, thanks

[08:41] <El_Che> I would use the name of your programming language as the root namespace

[08:42] <El_Che> MagicalBoBeepLang, MagicalBoBeepLang::Addons::Boobar

[08:42] <El_Che> and so on

[08:43] <floppy_disk> seems like a good idea

[08:44] <El_Che> I am full of them (it)

[08:44] <floppy_disk> :)

[18:43] <codesections> did the Raku CSV benchmark move (or go away?) It was at https://tux.nl/ but that's not loading for me

[18:44] <drakonis> codesections: are you aware of phoenix's liveview and do you think that epee's similar to it?

[18:45] *** sena_kun left
[18:45] <lizmat> codesections: don't think it moved

[18:46] <lizmat> since Tux left IRC about an hour ago as well, I assume there's some kind of connectivity issue

[18:46] <lizmat> tux.nl runs at his home, afaik

[18:46] *** sena_kun joined
[18:48] <drakonis> it seems quite similar to it

[18:48] <drakonis> reactive UI frameworks sure are something.

[18:49] *** zacts left
[18:50] <drakonis> abusing websockets for fun and profit

[18:56] <drakonis> anyways, i'm looking forward to playing with it and getting something nice done

[19:23] *** n1to joined
[19:30] *** guifa joined
[19:59] <SmokeMachine> drakonis: that phoenix remembered me of this: https://github.com/FCO/p6-react that’s also server-rendered and it’s possible to interact by websocket (automatically)

[19:59] <drakonis> it'd be quite useful to have

[19:59] *** zacts joined
[20:00] <drakonis> by the way, are there any benchmarks for seeing how well raku scales compared to erlang and elixir?

[20:00] <drakonis> that's a cool thing

[20:00] <drakonis> but i oughta ask, Slangs?

[20:01] <drakonis> sublanguages?

[20:02] <SmokeMachine> Here is the example using web sockets: https://github.com/FCO/p6-react/blob/master/ws.p6

[20:02] <drakonis> that does certainly look a lot like how liveview does components

[20:03] <drakonis> which is quite nice.

[20:03] <SmokeMachine> drakonis: I think you was asking about rakudo.js the other day, right?

[20:04] <drakonis> i did too, yes.

[20:06] <drakonis> i'm not sure if it maps to something like clojurescript

[20:06] <SmokeMachine> I don’t know if you saw my answer (it was too long after the question), but here is something using it (just a test and takes too long to load): https://fco.github.io/MemoizedDOM/todo6.html

[20:06] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/MemoizedDOM

[20:06] <drakonis> ah, i've seen that already, yes.

[20:08] <guifa> drakonis slangs are so much fun but generally still a WIP.  

[20:09] <drakonis> doesnt seem to be properly documented at the moment?

[20:10] <guifa> yeah, won't be much until the ability to make them gets a lot of polish.  For the most part, you have to use NQP and work with the QAST and that's part of Rakudo, not Raku

[20:10] <guifa> RakuAST will get that to a point that it will be officially supported in a stable manner

[20:10] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/BasicTest <-- but here's a module that shows some of what will be possible

[20:11] <codesections> Thanks, lizmat++

[20:11] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/BasicTest/blob/main/t/00-sanity.t <-- showing off the code (I should probably add some to the readme, but meh)

[20:15] <codesections> drakonis: I am aware of phoenix liveview!  Funny you should mention it, I've actually been giving it a fair bit of thought!  My initial plan *wasn't* for Epee to use that sort of websocket-driven model, but the more I noodle around, the more it seems seems like it could be a good fit

[20:16] <codesections> but I haven't had much time to work on Epee lately, so I haven't actually implemented anything along those lines

[20:17] <drakonis> oh i see, it has taken the backseat over developing persistent data structures, yeah?

[20:18] <drakonis> also, i keep getting your work on them is useful for saving a system image containing all state on disk?

[20:20] <drakonis> uh

[20:20] <drakonis> keep getting told that your work

[20:23] <drakonis> when will epee get released?

[20:40] *** discord-raku-bot left
[20:41] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[20:41] <codesections> I don't have a release date for epee yet, sorry ☹

[20:43] <drakonis> ah, okay.

[20:43] <drakonis> looking forward to when it does release

[22:05] <Geth> ¦ doc: patrickbkr++ created pull request #4045: Document MacOS quirk wrt DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and SIP

[22:05] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4045

[22:10] <kawaii_> Hello, I'm using the Red ORM and I've configured one of my columns to be constrained to an Array of Ints like this: `has Array[Int] @.encounter-id is column{ :type<integer[]> };` but I'm not sure if Red/Raku/Postgres have the same idea of what that should look like `Type check failed in assignment to @!encounter-id; expected Positional[Array[Int]] but got Array ([78])`, or is this due to the fact this particular entry it is trying to load only 

[22:10] <kawaii_> had a single Int in the "array"?

[22:14] *** lichtkind_ left
[22:14] <MasterDuke> `has Array[Int] @.encounter-id` is an array of Arrays of Int

[22:15] *** lichtkind_ joined
[22:16] <kawaii_> Arrayception 

[22:16] <MasterDuke> but when e.g., you have a parameterized array in a signature, you have to pass it an actual parameterized array, not just an array that happens to have all the elements of the correct type

[22:20] <MasterDuke> e.g., `sub foo(Int @ints) { ... }; foo([1, 2, 3]);` won't work but `sub foo(Int @int) { ... }; foo(Array[Int].new(1, 2, 3));` or `sub foo(@ints where @ints.are ~~ Int) { ... }; foo([1, 2, 3])` will

[22:21] <kawaii_> Ah thank you for the example! It clarifies it for me.

[23:05] <SmokeMachine> kawaii_: did that work on Red’s side?

[23:07] <kawaii_> SmokeMachine: I had a similar error but it wasn't a Red error so I wasn't sure what the issue was - I'm afk at the moment but I'll investigate further shortly.
