[00:01] <n1to> El_Che: I can't find the option in the settings, but I tried setting RAKULIB in the run configuration and via -I. Didn't seem to work. However I might set it to a wrong directory. I used '~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2022.02/share/perl6/site/sources' as it was the only one I found the files for Color in it.

[00:04] <n1to> japhb: Yeah, I have the SDK set and I even set the zef as package manager manually in the project settings. I had Color set in the META6.json. Then I noticed that Color showed up under external libraries, but didn't seem to find anything that Color provides.

[00:39] <guifa_> [Coke]: you're a Numberphile fan I take it hahaha

[00:41] <japhb> n1to: I tried adding Color to my current project as a dependency, and at first I thought there was a problem, but then I heard the fans spin up on my laptop, which happens whenever Comma is indexing something new.  After the fans calmed down, I was able to `use Color::Conversion;` in one of the modules and then tab-complete some of the conversion routines.

[00:42] <japhb> Note: I did the META6 update via File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules > Dependencies, dunno if that makes a difference to when the indexing happens.

[00:45] <n1to> japhb: I did that too, but for me nothing happens. However it doesn't show me Color in the dropdown when I put in the module name. Just other modules like Color::Names and such. Maybe there is already something wrong.

[00:46] *** zacts left
[00:54] <n1to> However, even for the given modules the import doesn't work and no indexing happens. Nonetheless thank you for your help. I have to go for now, but I will try again tommorrow. Maybe just trying to set everything up from the beginning.

[00:57] <japhb> n1to: Note that I had to override the Color::Named selection, and force just Color.

[00:57] <japhb> I've got a bug report open with something hinky about namespace completion, so we'll see if that rings a bell.

[00:58] <japhb> (Full disclosure: I *just* joined the Comma team part-time, so I'm still in the learning phase.)

[01:01] <perryprog> guifa_ ha nice catc

[01:01] <perryprog> catch*

[01:02] <n1to> I just invalidated the cache and now my fans get going too. Maybe he finds it now. He did ask me for Color::Names, but not for Color so far.

[01:04] <n1to> I am just beginning to learn raku, so nothing to worry about. You have been already really helpful. But really have to go now.

[01:05] <japhb> Good luck!

[01:14] <japhb> lizmat: While saving this conversation to the bug report, I found out how I'm still ending up on logs.liz.nl sometimes: that's what you get from "Copy link" in the ellipsis menu next to each log line, even if the site I'm viewing is the canonical irclogs.raku.org site.

[12:25] <n1to> japhb: I managed to get the Color import to kinda work. I had to remove Color with zef in the terminal and then restart the Comma IDE. Afterwards Comma detected the missing dependency and I let it install it. I can now run and test the project and get autocompletion. The `use` statements however are still marked as errors and the message that it can't find the module. The section under External Libraries is also not correctly populated.
