[04:18] * grondilu found it in history

[04:18] <grondilu> .seen melezhik

[04:18] <tellable6> grondilu, I saw melezhik 2022-12-17T17:40:19Z in #raku: <melezhik> draft -> draft of grant proposal for zef lock mechanism

[04:20] <grondilu> .tell melezhik on https://ci.sparrowhub.io/report/2203 the module FiniteField seem to be searched with the `.pm` extension instead of `.rakumod`.  I don't know why.  This might be the issue anyway.

[12:55] <Marcool04> just thought I'd pop by to give you a quick note that I did finally get rakudo to compile on my Raspberry Pi 3B+ recently switched to an aarch64 system. I increased swap to 8Gb, and also did `sysctl -w vm.swappiness=90` (up from default 60 a bit) and then it sailed through. Another thing I may have been having issues with is the power supply (a

[12:55] <Marcool04> never ending problem on RPI's), and so I also changed that to one I trust more (although the previous one had always been ok... anyhow). Total Virtual Ram usage was reported by htop at about 1700Mb during the build, but it only took about 20 minutes in the end!

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well done ðŸ¥³ it would be really nice if you could write about this in any shape or form - even just posting it at a more persistent place, Reddit or GH Discussions

[13:03] <Marcool04> sure yeah

[13:16] *** jpn joined
[13:20] <Marcool04> Done: https://old.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/zprcj0/compiling_rakudo_on_a_raspberry_pi_3b/?

[13:20] <El_Che> Marcool04: I have aarch64 packages, but I haven't released them yet because of time shortage

[13:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ðŸ¥³

[13:21] <El_Che> Marcool04: https://cirrus-ci.com/build/6700332659507200 go into your distro/version and open the pkg dir with the artefacts

[13:21] <El_Che> the idea is to push them to repos like the rest of rakudo-pkg

[13:24] *** jpn left
[13:29] <Marcool04> El_Che: oh that would be great if we could have more binaries when a new distribution is made

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/discussions/359 off we go (hopefully)

[13:29] <Marcool04> I'd be happy to help with tesing

[13:30] <Marcool04> testing*

[13:30] <Marcool04> I don't think I would feel confident enough to share my own builds (I'd likely mess up sooner or later)

[13:34] <Marcool04> or wouldn't it be possible to add linux-aarch64 to the Azure pipeline? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml#L226

[13:35] <Marcool04> (maybe also arm too, armv7h or armv7 or whatever it's referred to on the build infrastructure)

[13:37] <Marcool04> sorry I just noticed your previous message El_Che

[13:38] <Marcool04> with the cirrus-ci link

[13:40] <Marcool04> that's a rather impressive list of distros you have there
