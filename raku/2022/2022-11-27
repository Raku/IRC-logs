[00:09] <tbrowder> Ah, Perl Harbor Day!

[00:31] <[Coke]> should be a link on the raku.org page

[00:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Fair üïµÔ∏è

[00:39] <tbrowder> my email got bounced (rainbow@rsc.org)

[00:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> By the way, I'm figuring out how to switch from mowyw to a Template6-based solution

[00:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I needed time to understand how Template6 works, fortunately it's more or less a port of a rather known Perl module

[00:41] *** razetime joined
[00:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I came across something interesting, though. Code snippets.  No idea where they are shown. Inb4 no, not the main page snippets

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Is there something like a link map for Raku sites?

[00:55] <tbrowder>  any other email option for the Butterfly Award?

[00:56] *** sgrs left
[01:00] <ugexe> tbrowder: if you email me nlogan@gmail.com i'll submit it

[01:00] <ugexe> tbrowder: also if you can forward me the bounced email I can probably have someone see why it got bounced

[01:00] <tbrowder> wilco

[01:05] <tbrowder> so done

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I plan to make a blog post about doing data analysis over IRC messages. Should I or should I not include handles analysis? (E.g. who posts the most, who responds the fastest, etc.) That kind of analysis might be seen as, say, "privacy violating."

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I want to mention that I can easily not include that analysis -- it is just a by-product of the text analysis of the IRC messages.

[15:04] <ugexe> oh oops, I solicited rainbow butterfly votes to rainbow@rsc.org but its actually rainbow@raku.org

[15:05] <ugexe> so send your votes there instead

[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Answering my own question here (for the record) -- I will replace the handle nicknames with randomly derived nicknames.

[16:44] <sarna> hey, does raku have something like class variables? I want to define a constant in my class that'd be visible to all instances

[16:47] <ugexe> m: class Foo { constant \bar = rand; method bar { bar } }; say Foo.new.bar; say Foo.new.bar

[16:48] <sarna> great, thanks :)

[17:13] <sarna> I'm getting a really bizarre error when trying to use a local module - could anybody please take a look? searching for it I get 0 hits :( I can reproduce it even with a small snippet https://paste.sr.ht/~sarna/5f77b1df45571c382b6a5983d7144b7eeb8c383d

[17:17] <ugexe> the error mentions $address, but that doesnt appear in any of your snippet 

[17:18] <sarna> that's the most confusing part :)

[17:19] <ugexe> maybe `rm -rf .precomp`, remove the `use lib (".")`, and try again with `raku -I. main.raku`

[17:20] <sarna> there's no `.precomp` dir. I removed `use lib (".")` and I'm getting exactly the same error

[17:21] <ugexe> it might need to be called SomeModule.rakumod depending on your file system

[17:21] <ugexe> not somemodule.rakumod

[17:21] <ugexe> since you are importing it via `use SomeModule`

[17:23] <sarna> ohh that was it! now it works, had to correct `$Foo.new` to `Foo.new` :) thank you!

[17:23] <sarna> though the initial error doesn't point to it at all haha

[17:24] <ugexe> i think its from something like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/1292357de1a1fd20adb4606d8157ab675a125190/src/core.c/Distribution/Locally.pm6#L4

[22:40] <[Coke]> that dies in the REPL here.

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> everything in the REPL is incorrect until proven correct üòâ

[22:48] <[Coke]> can i have multiple rakubrew installs using the same version of raku?

[22:48] <[Coke]> (and then i can have different sets of installed modules)
