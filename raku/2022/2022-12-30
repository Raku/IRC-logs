[07:34] <Homer_Simpson> wanted feature (plz):

[07:34] <Homer_Simpson> my $rawchr = `a`;

[07:34] <Homer_Simpson> my @rawarray = `abc`; say($rawchr+2); #c

[07:34] <Homer_Simpson> say(@rawarray[1]+5); #f

[07:34] <Homer_Simpson> hmm my irc client removed my grave accents

[07:37] <Homer_Simpson> basically you can do '`a`'; for a constant literal char and "`a`"; for an array of chars

[07:39] <Homer_Simpson> you just have to escape the `` to print literally ``a`` rather than a

[07:40] <Homer_Simpson> or the `` `` can go on the outsides of ' ' or  " "

[07:42] *** evalable6 left
[07:42] *** linkable6 left
[07:43] <Homer_Simpson> they are only null terminated if used with " " or ' ' or if its more than one character in the `` ``

[07:44] *** evalable6 joined
[07:44] <Homer_Simpson> grave accent is standard ascii so its on just about every keyboard

[07:45] *** linkable6 joined
[07:51] <Homer_Simpson> my @`buf for array, or $`chr for variable (scalar) or %`hash 

[07:52] <Homer_Simpson> oops: my @``buf for array, or $``chr for variable (scalar) or %``hash 

[07:52] <Homer_Simpson> close enough :(

[08:05] *** Sgeo left
[08:06] <Homer_Simpson> oh great `` means multiline comment when used with #

[08:09] <Homer_Simpson> well its really #` not `` or @`` or $` or %``

[08:09] <Homer_Simpson> I hate this fuckin irc client

[20:51] <guifa> Homer_Simpson: you can write your own operator to that.  It's extremely easy if you're okay with including a quote mark, a bit more complicated if you want just the grave accent and nothing more

[23:39] <Xliff> guifa: Can you read .ods files?

[23:40] <guifa> by hand? no.  But LibreOffice can lol

[23:41] <Xliff> Heheh~!

[23:41] <Xliff> OK, one sec.

[23:42] <guifa> If you're looking to write a module

[23:42] <guifa> https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c066363_ISO_IEC_26300-1_2015.zip

[23:42] <guifa> zip link takes you to an HTML download

[23:43] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/commit/d4c3619cf9

[23:45] <Xliff> guifa: Ha! Useful that. Maybe sometime in the next couple of years. 

[23:45] * guifa started reviewing number formatting and forgot how much of a pain in the butt the patterns are.

[23:45] <Xliff> Unless I can get some folks to work with to do it. Tired of being a solo act.

[23:45] <guifa>  I'm not sure if there's a way to single pass parse them :-(

[23:45] <Xliff> guifa: What? ODS sheets?

[23:46] <guifa> No, for CLDR stuff

[23:46] *** CodeTortoise left
[23:46] <guifa> it's going to be my first involved RakuAST project

[23:46] <Xliff> Ah. Not well versed on those.

[23:46] <Xliff> Ooh! Sounds fun. Now THAT I could sink my teeth into.

[23:46] <Xliff> What spec are you working from?

[23:47] <guifa> https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Number_Format_Patterns

[23:47] <guifa> They seem deceptively easy.  And then they just throw in these things that sound like edge cases that someone came up with and they tried to shoehorn them into the standard

[23:48] <Xliff> LOL.

[23:48] <guifa> like they made two grouping sizes for commas, because some languages like Hindi will do 12,34,567

[23:48] <Xliff> OK. I think I can see what you are talking about.

[23:48] <Xliff> Um... ew.

[23:48] <guifa> but then you read the spec and they're like "oh, but NIST requires grouping the fractional part too"

[23:49] <guifa> so actually there are THREE grouping sizes

[23:50] <Xliff> So make grouping depend on the reverse position of the comma.

[23:50] <guifa> so #,##,##0.####,# would mean group the hundred/tens/ones together, and for higher ones, group by two digits (thousand/myriad, lakh/million, ten/hundred million)

[23:50] *** CodeTortoise joined
[23:50] <Xliff> Right... so lookit.

[23:50] <guifa> and then every fourth fractional

[23:50] <guifa> BUT

[23:50] <guifa> if you get

[23:50] <guifa> #,#,#,#,##,##0

[23:50] <guifa> you ignore all the initial commas

[23:51] <guifa> oh but there's a difference beteween # and 0 (0 controls for required digits, but it's undefined in the spec what #0# might mean, unless it's scientific, in which case it is, but you can't know that until you've found an E, which is a literal E unless followed by a number and… yeah

[23:51] <Xliff> "#,####.0##,##,#", you count the #, and then if you get a "," --  you push 10 ** <count> into @groups. You can never fail.

[23:52] <Xliff> So if you get a group of one, you have to ignore everything!

[23:52] <Xliff> So your grouping can't be 10 * <tail>

[23:53] <Xliff> Ah... such is life with ambiguous specs. 

[23:53] <Xliff> I used to be a business analyst. Tried it, since I couldn't find a coding job.

[23:53] <Xliff> Hated it, but picked up some valuable skills.

[23:53] <guifa> oh and then if the number isn't 0… it controls for required digits AND rounding lol

[23:53] <Xliff> Yeah. Read that one. Confused me a bit.

[23:53] <Xliff> So if the number is larger than the specified digit, you round up?

[23:54] <Xliff> So #1 means a "12" would turn into "20"

[23:54] <guifa> #1 would round to the nearest multiple of 1

[23:54] <Xliff> Oh!

[23:55] <guifa> #10 would round to the nearest multiple of 10

[23:55] <Xliff> So #2 means a "13" would turn into "14"

[23:55] <guifa> correct, but since it uses half even rounding… "15" would also round to 14

[23:55] <Xliff> Yikes!

[23:56] <Xliff> My brain says "Flea!" but that might be due to the last of the 'nog.

[23:56] <guifa> yeah it's a mess lol.  I want to use grammars to parse it but the information density I'm afraid may be too much

[23:56] <Xliff> Grammars with code blocks are your only hope, padawan.

[23:56] <Xliff> ( Or maybe s/padawan/sensei/ ? )

[23:57] <guifa> yeah, grammars with embedded actions would work quite nicely

[23:57] <guifa> because I could set values during the parse phase

[23:57] <Xliff> Yep.

[23:57] <guifa> unfortunately, I can't set a dynamic in token TOP and have it available in method TOP

[23:57] <Xliff> Use a dummy rule then./

[23:58] <guifa> hmm

[23:58] <guifa> I forgot about those

[23:58] <Xliff> Set your dynamics up in TOP, then call <REALTOP>

[23:59] <guifa> wow
