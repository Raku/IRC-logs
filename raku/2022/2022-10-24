[09:55] <lizmat> shall I mention this in the weekly?

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's all up to you... I wonder if it deserves this kind of honor. If there is anything valuable in there, sure üòÑ

[14:53] <SmokeMachine> I was reading this (https://github.com/2colours/Raku-ideas/blob/main/!%3D%20with%20junctions.md). I feel like that all problems with `$bla !op all(1, 2, 3)` would be fixed if, instead of `!all($bla op 1, $bla op 2, $bla op 3)`, it was `all($bla !op 1, $bla !op 2, $bla !op 3)`. Would something like that make sense?

[14:58] <[Coke]> looking at week.golf and man is it hard to golf raku when "no warnings" doesn't work. :)

[15:01] <[Coke]> lizmat: doesn't look like you can submit answers in Raku yet.

[15:01] <[Coke]> (coming soon)

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> SmokeMachine: that sheet is a very-very much alpha draft of a petition for exactly that üòÑ

[15:04] <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: where do I sign in?! :)

[15:04] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[15:15] <[Coke]> I am at 212 bytes right now for the current week.golf

[15:16] <[Coke]> er, 205 (removed some newlines. :)

[15:18] <[Coke]> (ah, defaults to not showing STDERR, let all the warnings happen...)

[16:09] <[Coke]> lizmat: that might work, but for now I can just ignore stderr

[16:09] <[Coke]> m: "this".eq("this")

[16:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 388924d67: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'eq' for invocant of type 'Str'.  Did you mean 'Seq'?‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[16:09] <[Coke]> I am surprised that method doesn't exist.

[16:11] <ugexe> i'm not. then users could expect e.g. 1.==(1) to work

[16:11] <[Coke]> Yes, we could expect that too. :)

[16:12] <[Coke]> but even if it's not the name of the operator, seems like there should be an .equals or something similar.

[16:12] <ugexe> .match with anchors

[16:13] <[Coke]> .ACCEPTS maybe.

[16:13] <[Coke]> (not great for golfing, but if I really want the method, there it is.)

[16:20] <ugexe> .eq( is already more characters though, and it still needs a )

[17:06] <Xliff> Depends on how many times you need &eq.

[17:06] <Xliff> Although I can't see that saving you much in a golf.

[18:10] <[Coke]> ugexe: it's more characters if you don't already have one of the things in $_, yes

[18:10] *** haxxelotto left
[18:11] <[Coke]> .eq("x") is shorter than $_ eq "x" by one character! (yes, optimizing for golf is a bad idea. :)

[18:14] *** Kaipei left
[18:16] * [Coke] goes afk for about 4days.

[18:16] <tonyo> isn't `"eq"eq$_` shorter than `.eq("eq")` ? 

[18:16] <tonyo> m: $_='eq'; say 'eq'eq$_
