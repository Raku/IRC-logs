[22:32] <tbrowder> .ask tonyo is it possible to use fez in a github workflow test? mine is failing, as expected, but a fake account for testing would be handy if it could be done securely. hm, maybe i should check its docs  :-)

[22:32] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to tonyo

[23:01] <ugexe> tbrowder: what do you need a fake account for?

[23:01] <ugexe> usually CI test apps have a way of encrypting secrets if you want to use an actual account

[23:02] <ugexe> for instance: i pass  github access token via https://github.com/ugexe/Raku-CompUnit--Repository--Github/blob/09ce009f71fe9ef2a34efe39944c1d863502869e/.appveyor.yml#L5-L7

[23:03] <ugexe> the token is encoded into the string you see there on appveyors site before its committed 

[23:19] *** tailgate left
[23:31] <tbrowder> i don't use ci, just github workflows, but i can read some more and see if there is a way on github. in the meantime, i can mod the tests to elim problems.
