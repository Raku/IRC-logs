[16:20] <jjatria> I've been thinking about HTTP cookies lately: https://gitlab.com/jjatria/cookie-jar

[16:21] <jjatria> Specifically, about something I could use with HTTP::Tiny to manage cookies

[16:22] <jjatria> Still not released, but close. Any comments or thoughts about it are welcome~ üçø

[19:54] <jjatria> Voldenet: I thought about it, but that's not in RFC6265. It is on the draft that is likely to be approved, but it was hard to decide what to support from there and what not to

[19:55] <jjatria> So for this first release I'm targetting RFC6265 as it is, and working on the side on the support for the drafted features. Maybe with a `:draft` flag on construction? Not sure yet

[20:18] <Voldenet> the problem is that SameSite is _in use right now_

[20:23] <Voldenet> though it mostly makes sense for http servers, I'm not sure if http clients would find this useful anyhow

[20:29] *** swaggboi left
[20:30] *** swaggboi joined
[20:43] <jjatria> Yeah, it's in use right now, but in draft form, so it can change. In fact, it has already changed at least once. That's why I'm thinking I could add support for some of those experimental features that users can opt in to with a flag or something like it

[20:57] <Voldenet> hm, maybe just add AT-KEY and so on

[21:00] <Voldenet> jjatria: also, bug `use Cookie::Jar; with Cookie::Jar.new() { .add("https://test.com", "hello=world; path=/; secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None"); say .get("what") }`

[21:20] <Voldenet> would also be nice to handle the use case: "get the cookie for domain", something like `.get('https://test.com', 'session_id')`
