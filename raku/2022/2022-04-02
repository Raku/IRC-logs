[00:17] <grondilu> FYI I wanted to use a Blob as a crypto key so I wanted to add methods such as "sign", "verify" and so on.

[00:19] <grondilu> ok.  Is this specced or could it change in the future?
[00:21] <grondilu> oh now I seem to recall that native types can not be mixed.   I had seen that with native integers long ago.
[00:21] *** Kaiepi left
[00:21] <grondilu> I suppose the same is true with blobs.
[00:21] <Voldenet> it appears that repr things can't be mixed in, but nothing in Blob says it can't
[00:25] <Voldenet> I'm speculating that it might be changed in the future for consistency
[00:26] <grondilu> noted
[00:28] <Voldenet> but it's my pure guess
[00:37] <Voldenet> based on how there's nothing regarding this in docs (in fact, only Buf and utf8 are repr('VMArray') according to docs)
[00:46] <grondilu> yeah after all isn't Blob supposed to be to blob, buf and so on what Int is to native integers?  The upper case marking the non-repr type or something?

If I use the quantifier ** like in `token tok { \w ** 5 };` and the input is 'aaaaaa' the match is true in the grammar. I need to specify the max chars to match in this token. Is possible? Thanks for the help!

[19:37] <neither> there is no inheritance relation going on by the way
[20:18] <moritz> give them a common marker role, like Pack::Age::Cls::Type, and then check against that role

[22:44] <grondilu> Isn't there such a thing as a parametrized module?  I've tried with a role but failed :
[22:45] <grondilu> m: role Foo[$foo] { sub talk is export { say "$foo" } }; import Foo["hi"]; talk
[22:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    talk used at line 1␤␤»
[22:46] <grondilu> m: module Foo { sub talk is export { say "hi" } }; import Foo; talk
[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «hi␤»
