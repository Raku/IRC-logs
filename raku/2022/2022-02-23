[21:26] <moon-child> damn ... I think I will have to switch away from raku for my assembler's testrunner
[21:26] <moon-child> too slow.  Even threaded, it takes quite a long time
[21:26] <moon-child> (granted this is generating nearly 50mb of test cases)
[21:27] <MasterDuke> have any short example case we can profile?
[21:36] <moon-child> well, hmm.  Now I am confused.  If I only make it generate the test cases, it takes about 10 seconds; if I only make it run the tests, it takes about 8 seconds.  There is no way that should take 8 seconds; it takes just under a second if I run them manually from the shell
[21:38] <moon-child> so maybe there is contention somewhere with starting processes?

[21:52] <moon-child> 48 is the number of cores I have.  8 is not quite a large enough batch size to use up all those cores, but a smaller batch size is slower

[22:00] <gfldex> run will create an instance of Proc what will create an instance of Proc::Async. So Rakudo is fighting with the spawned process over hardware threads.
