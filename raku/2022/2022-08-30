[00:35] <ToddAndMargo> Hi All, How do I trigger and detach and external program from inside Raku?  I want the program to go off on its own and I do not want any results back from it.   -T

[01:06] <ToddAndMargo> `run` seems to what for the result.

[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> Figured it out with shell but not run

[01:21] <ToddAndMargo> shell "zenity --info --title \"$Title\" --text \"$NotifyStr\" --width=220 --timeout=$Timeout &";

[01:27] <ToddAndMargo> eems to what for the result. = seems to wait for the result.  Stinking typos

[14:20] <Altreus> I hear it might be an option to have the more symmetrical $promise.await instead of $promise.result (probably as well as, now) - is there a reason it's not already there? Should I suggest it somewhere?

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Samecase I was looking around in the docs

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > s:global:samecase[the] = 'a';

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and found this peculiar syntax

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how does it work?

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > If you use balancing curly braces, square brackets, or parentheses, the substitution works like this instead:

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > 

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > `s[replace] = 'with';`

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> same page above

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is this compiler magic?

[17:11] <tonyo> it's standard regex

[17:11] <tonyo> s/ is a substitution and the :global is the full flag of s:g/ 

[17:11] <tonyo> samecase just matches the replaced value's

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I meant the assignment

[18:07] <bpv> Hello, does anyone know how to compile Raku code into MoarVM bytecode?

[18:07] *** reportable6 left
[18:08] *** reportable6 joined
[18:13] <tonyo> what assignment? by default it operates on $_

[18:15] <tonyo> bpv: to what end? if it's a local library then the first time it's `use`d it's precomp'd and then reused so long as the source hasn't changed, if it's installed by zef then iirc it's precompd upon install but ugexe or nine might have more info

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > s[replace] = 'with';

[18:16] <lizmat> It's precomped at install for the then active repo-chain.  If you change that, e.g. by adding an -I, it will get recompiled once again for *that* particular repo chain

[18:17] <bpv> tonyo: I'm looking to compile a simple Raku script into a standalone file to execute via MoarVM. I want to be able to run this file with just MoarVM if possible.

[18:19] <tonyo> nemokosch: looking for samecase in the rakudo source will lead you to the entry point and then eventually to the implementation which will lead you to some nqp

[18:19] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[18:20] <lizmat> bpv: if it is a Raku script, It will need a lot of the Rakudo infrastructure as well, so you'd need those bytecode files as well

[18:21] <lizmat> and the logic to load them in the correct order, is also in the Rakudo source...

[18:21] <lizmat> bpv: in a way, this problem is the same as creating a single executable file for a Raku program

[18:21] <lizmat> some work has been done in that area... but it has stalled

[18:23] <El_Che> that would be so cool

[18:23] <tellable6> 2022-08-21T18:15:56Z #raku-dev <jdv> El_Che need help rebuilding the blin image on debian testing because https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jdv/ffa82e105b75a90d3ff87804005a174b/raw/c6cffe4195a580005fd4372a23bde2d9a78717a6/gistfile1.txt

[18:31] <lizmat> pretty much, but I would gladly be proven wrong :)

[18:35] *** TieUpYourCamel joined
[18:41] <El_Che> lizmat: it sounds like an inner struggle when only you can proof yourself wrong (or right)

[18:41] <bpv> lizmat: Well, I guess I will just stick to compiled libs then :\

[18:42] <lizmat> El_Che: it''s more the scientific method: nobody's been able to prove me wrong, so I'm right

[18:43] <El_Che> you little popper

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm reading about Riemann's conjecture

[18:43] <El_Che> popper, not poopr :)

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> may we have lizmat's conjecture now?

[18:43] <bpv> Very funny :b

[18:44] <lizmat> for the less enlightened: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper

[18:47] <bpv> Feyerabend is my pal :)

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm afraid Popper is more quoted for politics these days
