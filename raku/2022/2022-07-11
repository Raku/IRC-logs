[08:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> This is both controversial and technically false - the value gets truncated, not rounded

[09:00] <gfldex> it wouldn't hurt is tellable6 would get a little bit smarter

[12:54] <moritz> not much, these days, to be honest. Used to be pretty big into grammars, these days it's more like better shell scripts

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Ah so you‚Äôre just the person to ask about grammars then. üôÇ

[12:55] <moritz> I think the last "proper" script I wrote was for splitting PDFs into separate files per chapter, using pdftk: https://gist.github.com/moritz/ea14aa095b3bd2e72a5667421808b911

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> I want to write a language in raku.

[12:56] <moritz> ah, then parsing is likely the first step :-) (and if you believe most of the compiler books, about 60% of the work, because they always seem to spend soooo much energy and page count on parsing...)

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Haha you wrote the book? That‚Äôs crazy.

[12:59] <moritz> yes, pretty crazy. It's the book I'm the most proud of, and the one with the best reviews on amazon, and the one with the worst sales numbers :-)

[12:59] <moritz> simply too small of a nice to sell in higher numbers

[13:20] <Altai-man> lizmat++

[13:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Potentially it‚Äôd be cool to try and get an AOT compiler option for raku, I heard there‚Äôs a test suite for compilers?

[13:41] <nine> Quibono: the language is defined by a specification test suite. So there's that. Also the new RakuAST based frontend will make it much easier to try fancy things like writing an AOT compiler. That said, the latter would be a huge undertaking.

[18:17] <tonyo> jjatria: limited in what way? Once you have the token you can just put the token in the cloud (should be in the fez config file if you're logged in)

[18:17] <jjatria> I didn't know fez could generate tokens already. How do they work?

[18:17] <jjatria> I was thinking limited in that you could given them permission to push only certain dists, etc

[18:18] <tonyo> Ah, I have nothing like that set up

[18:18] <tonyo> They're just login tokens and they expire after 30 days

[18:18] <jjatria> Yeah, I mean, I don't know how often a setup like this would be needed

[18:19] <tonyo> The idea of using an org could also help so you just have an org and make a generic user for the org and push dists that way

[18:19] <jjatria> But then that bot user can still make releases for any dist in that org, right?

[18:20] <jjatria> It would serve to disconnect this from your personal creds, but it would still have global write access

[18:20] <jjatria> global = inside that org

[18:21] <tonyo> Yea they could release any dist in that org, was thinking more to isolate your own user

[18:21] <jjatria> (in case you've missed the context: this is for https://raku.land/zef:jjatria/PublicSuffix with the idea that something could trigger a new release whenever the public suffix list gets an update)

[18:21] <tonyo> Hmm I'll give that a think

[18:22] <tonyo> That sounds like something using a jwt would solve

[18:23] <jjatria> Incidentally: with a setup like that, generating up to several releases per week in busy periods it seems, would storage become a problem?

[18:23] <jjatria> re. jwt: hm, interesting...

[19:03] <melezhik> jjatria my take on that - one could spin up a sparky server , that would run scheduled job to check updates from public suffix list and then if any will trigger a new distro release, Sparky covers pretty much all this scheduling logic and even more - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky#run-by-cron

[19:03] <melezhik> the only question is if you are willing to spin up and support Sparky instance

[19:05] <melezhik> as for the secrets - they could be injected into Sparky VM as env vars, so that for example fez-login plugin could use this information to setup login to fez - http://sparrowhub.io/plugin/fez-login/0.000003

[19:36] <guifa> A whatever isn't callable though

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Ah, this is kind of stupid though, the star represents a very exact value

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> `* + 2 - 2` is equal to `*`, except one has a nice interface to work with

[20:23] <guifa> nemokosch: ah.  In that case, I'd still do a multi, and just have the whatever return a whatever returning the object itself (via .self)

[20:23] <tellable6> guifa, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[20:23] <guifa> m: multi sub foo(WhateverCode &bar) { bar(42) }; multi sub foo(Whatever &) { samewith *.self }; say foo (* + 2); say foo *;

[20:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 934f9895e: OUTPUT: ¬´44‚ê§42‚ê§¬ª

[20:28] *** sena_kun joined
[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why does this work? üòÖ

[20:40] <guifa> If you say foo * + 2, the * + 2 becomes a WhateverCode (which is a callable, hence we can $bar(42) )

[20:41] <guifa> If you say foo *, it's a Whatever, not useful since it's not callable.  samewith says "call foo again, but use this other set of arguments instead"

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so far so good

[20:41] <guifa> The main multi candidate will only take a whatevercode though, so we need to a pass a whatevercode identity function, as it were

[20:43] <guifa> the only way to do that that I know of is *.self (and it's a method on Mu, so guaranteed to work for *everything*)

[20:43] <guifa> et viol√†, I finally found a use for .self !

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> indeed, so what is the whatevercode identity function? üßê

[20:43] <guifa> *.self

[20:44] <guifa> m: my &foo = *.self; say foo 55; say foo 'bar'; say foo /regex/

[20:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 934f9895e: OUTPUT: ¬´55‚ê§bar‚ê§/regex/‚ê§¬ª

[20:46] <guifa> or put another way, *.self is equivalent to -> $x {¬†$x.self }, which by definition produces the same as -> $x { $x }

[20:47] *** jaguart joined
[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh, so in this case, the star has no special relevance

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it just happens to be a Whatever-ish way

[20:49] <guifa> Yeah.  Per the docs

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is good enough I'd say

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> thanks

[20:49] <guifa> "Whatever is a class whose objects don't have any explicit meaning; it gets its semantics from other routines that accept Whatever-objects as markers to do something special. Using the * literal as an operand creates a Whatever object."
