[06:23] <tonyo> tbrowder: should have the oauth cro app part of the tut up tomorrow, still working through some flows and learning a little bit of cro

[06:57] <El_Che> tonyo: are you adding oauth2/oidc support to cro? If so: hero

[06:57] <tonyo> yea

[06:57] <El_Che> hero then

[06:57] <tonyo> well, i'm not writing a module for it but i'm making a tut

[06:57] <tonyo> that could easily be a module (i guess)

[06:58] <El_Che> idd

[06:58] <El_Che> I have some experience with the server side

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Thank you for your quick response on my Acme::Text::UpsideDown bug report. Gathering corresponding symbol pairs is not that easy…

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> To me at least …

[12:37] <lizmat> Yeah... it's pretty messy...perhaps the "uw" script installed by uniname-words can help ?

[12:38] <lizmat> glad to have someone else do that :-)

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Yes, I did look at uniname-words few weeks/months ago -- vert useful.

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Precisely for the upside-down mappings being messy.

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> *"very useful", not "vert useful"...

[17:45] <p6steve> hi - I recall a comment some time back that someone needs to adopt Inline::Python ... is it being actively maintained?

[17:47] <Voldenet> nope

[17:48] <Voldenet> I've tried using it and it just had to copy whole thing and install local version

[17:48] <Voldenet> with some modifications, like explicit construction/destruction

[17:51] *** MoC left
[17:52] <p6steve> yes - i have been successful - needs exclude="python3" otherwise ok on 2021.05

[17:52] <p6steve> had to go --force-test on 2022.02

[17:54] <p6steve> (so my workaround has been use 2021.15 or --force-test)

[17:54] <p6steve> now I am hitting some "real" issues...

[17:55] <p6steve> (ie. real for my project to connect to Python Pandas)

[17:57] <p6steve> I am tempted to roll up my sleeves and try and fix myself ... is there any design doc (or "how it works" blogs) out there?

[18:02] *** ismustachio joined
[18:02] <lizmat> p6steve: no, but I'm pretty sure nine will be helping you if you take this on!

[18:06] *** reportable6 left
[18:07] <p6steve> @lizmat - I have been tempted to put in for a TPF development grant for a couple of things ... but noted the prerequisite to be a core raku contributor ... would adoption of Inline::Python qualify?

[18:07] *** reportable6 joined
[18:07] *** ismustachio left
[18:08] <lizmat> where is that prerequisite mentioned?

[18:08] <lizmat> but yeah, I'd think that an application by you would qualify

[18:08] <lizmat> although I can't really say, as I'n not on the Grant Committee anymore

[18:09] <p6steve> https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/call_for_grants_jan_2022

[18:09] <p6steve> The applicant must be a contributor to the Raku language specification or one of its implementations.

[18:09] <p6steve> The application must be endorsed by one or more people in Raku Steering Council.

[18:09] <p6steve> .or

[18:11] <lizmat> a. having several prominent Raku modules out there *and* blogging about it, makes you a contributor (whether you like that or not :-)

[18:11] <lizmat> b. You are hereby endorsed by me

[18:12] <Voldenet> I don't know how helpful it will be, but Inline::Python is mostly pyhelper.c and thin wrapper over it, the whole thing is under 1k LOC

[18:12] <p6steve> anyway - either way I need to work out if I have the skills as I get closer to the metal ... so I will dig in and try and fix (probably needing some help) and PR back if I get on OK

[18:12] <codesections> "You are hereby endorsed by me" me to!  (though feel free to email rsc@raku.org if you want something other than an IRC log :) ) 

[18:13] <p6steve> only then will I be able to judge the sensibleness of adoption

[18:13] <codesections> also, I agree that "core contributor" is/should be very broad there, and would cover you 

[18:13] <p6steve> oh - excellent - thanks!

[18:13] <p6steve> both

[18:15] *** ismustachio joined
[18:38] <tonyo> i should write a grant for doing a module test grid/harness for different oses+rakudo versions

[18:41] <p6steve> raku -v

[18:42] <nine> p6steve: in short, Inline::Python hasn't seen development in probably 5 years, except for a few hours to port it to Python 3.

[18:44] <nine> p6steve: what it needs is someone looking at Inline::Perl5 and porting that to Inline::Python. Most importantly the way it creates wrapper classes for Perl packages which are a huge part of making integration seamless and for giving decent performance.

[18:44] <p6steve> @nine yes, I remember seeing that comment too in the past

[18:44] <nine> Inline::Perl5 probably looks quite large in comparison, but that's because for performance reasons there's a lot of duplicated code (e.g. a generic way to call methods and then special ways for methods with 0, 1 and 2 arguments)

[18:48] <p6steve> hmmm - 8.8k vs. 2.1k ;-)

[18:49] <p6steve> (using githib gloc to count total lines)

[18:51] <p6steve> @nine - I think the best start anyway is for me to fix my problem and PR it on the current base since i would need to learn how the current one works before i woul dbe able to consider a porting effort
