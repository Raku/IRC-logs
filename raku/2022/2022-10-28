[00:29] <japhb> Xliff: If you're talking about the difference between Terminal::Print::DecodedInput and the later versions of similar code -- T::P::DI is a hack that *mostly* works, as long as your needs are not too great.  The later modules try to actually get *correct* parsing, based on the work in Terminal::ANSIParser, and with the ability to send queries to (and receive responses from, of course) the terminal/terminal

[10:32] <Nemokosch> hi hi
[10:33] <Nemokosch> m: say '1' ~~ S/1/2/
[10:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar ef835615f: OUTPUT: ¬´Potential difficulties:‚ê§    Smartmatch with S/// is not useful. You can use given instead: S/// given $foo‚ê§    at <tmp>:1‚ê§    ------> say '1' ~~ ‚èèS/1/2/‚ê§2‚ê§¬ª
[10:33] <Nemokosch> Telling lies again, ha? :s
[10:34] <Nemokosch> Does anybody know about this fake potential difficulty? Smartmatch with S/// is not only useful but it does work, even.
[10:43] <lizmat> how does it work ?
[10:46] <Nemokosch> it did correctly return 2
[10:50] <Nemokosch> these "potential difficulties" are sometimes more harmful than useful, to be honest; smartmatching does set the topic variable and anyway, why _should_ it not work when s/// also works with smartmatching
[10:54] <lizmat> m: no worries; say '1' ~~ S/1/2/
[10:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar ef835615f: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[10:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar ef835615f: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot modify an immutable Str (1)‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª
[10:55] <lizmat> perhaps the worry should be for the "s" case   ....
[10:58] <Nemokosch> the s case is also good if the LHS is mutable
[11:00] <Nemokosch> m: my $foo = '1'; $foo ~~ s/1/blah/; say $foo;
[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar ef835615f: OUTPUT: ¬´blah‚ê§¬ª
[11:01] <Nemokosch> I'd say smartmatching to S/// is in fact more useful than to s/// because you can use it as a part of a longer expression.
[11:02] <Nemokosch> for s/// the return value seems to be as if you did m// or sth alike
[11:02] <lizmat> yeah, that's why I like to chain .subst statements all the time  :)
[11:03] *** jjido joined
[11:04] <Nemokosch> Fair point but wouldn't it be good if something ~~ S/// just didn't shout? ^^
[11:05] <lizmat> seems like the original text was "Smartmatch with S/// can never succeed because the subsequent string match will fail"

[11:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar ef835615f: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª
[11:08] <Nemokosch> I would say this paradigm is elegant even
[11:10] <lizmat> this was the associated issue: https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/5273
[11:11] * lizmat goes back to look at other stuff
[11:13] <Nemokosch> the only concern I could see arise is that this smart"match" doesn't produce a Bool value. However, that goes for m// as well, and there might be others
[11:13] *** Kaiepi left
[11:14] <Nemokosch> So maybe it's not even a criterion of smartmatch to always be strictly about matching in the "is it or is it not" sense

[12:50] *** jgaz joined
[12:53] <Ulti> or perhaps more importantly would value that
[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is Dash?

[13:25] <[Coke]> .
[13:27] <Nemokosch> boo
[13:28] * [Coke] returns from a business trip to find his long running irc session is kaput and all messages lost.
[13:29] * [Coke] read some raku blog posts while traveling, thanks lizmat et al. :)
[13:42] <Ulti> Nemokosch it's a documentation tool, basically a man system but GUIafied https://kapeli.com/dash the main thing is it has a "docset" format thats basically a precompiled SQLite file indexing the docs plus all the docs in a directory. https://zealdocs.org/ is a Linux client
[13:43] <Ulti> I noticed Perl 5 is on there but not Raku, and p6doc being relatively similar it might not be very hard to sort out a Raku docset
[13:47] <Nemokosch> Seems like some greedy Mac-orinted thing, I for one don't feel positive towards anything that starts like this
[13:48] <Voldenet> I'm betting that some mac-owning person might implement that eventually
[13:49] <Ulti> who do you think I am???
[13:49] <Voldenet> :)
[13:49] <Ulti> I havent touched anything to do with the doc system in Raku though and know there are some peeps here deep in it
[13:50] <Ulti> I'll start by taking a look how the perldoc version for P5 works
[13:50] <Ulti> though I think its one supported by the author of Dash which is maybe less helpful
[13:51] <Ulti> I tend to have at all times like 20 browser tabs open with docs in, which destroys battery life and is just annoying they're not local
[13:52] <Ulti> I also program in maybe 5 different languages regularly so having to use different tools to search the docs is mildly annoying
[13:54] <Voldenet> ‚Ä¶i just use one tool, web browser :>
[13:54] <Voldenet> though I get the point
[13:58] <Ulti> a little Raku program that understands the docset format and can search from the CLI would also be a neat outcome of playing around, given if Im modelling the SQLite file to write one I can definitely go around reading and searching them
[13:58] <Ulti> maybe render as ascii to the terminal too...
[14:00] <Nemokosch> the browser is the new OS haha
[14:00] <Voldenet> you can run x86 vms through webasm
[14:01] <Altreus> Where does zef come from, or whatever's replaced zef if that's a thing?
[14:02] <Altreus> it's not in rakudo-moar-2022.07-01-linux-x86_64-gcc.tar.gz
[14:03] <Voldenet> https://raku.land/github:ugexe/zef
[14:03] <Ulti> Altreus I thought that was always true?
[14:03] <Voldenet> the installation section works, I've tested this many times
[14:03] <Altreus> It might be but I'm usually several months removed from the last time I downloaded raku :D
[14:04] <Altreus> so I never remember that this happened before
[14:04] <Altreus> Voldenet: thanks :)
[14:05] <Voldenet> Ulti: I think that you can use https://kapeli.com/docsets#copyDocumentation with https://github.com/Raku/doc
[14:06] <Voldenet> BUT creating good index will be difficult, because docs don't contain enough semantic info
[14:07] <Altreus> Personally I've found pod6 (what's it called now?) to be harder to use than pod5
[14:13] <Altreus> hrm i've linked $PATH/raku to bin/raku from the dist, which itself links to rakudo, and installing zef seems to want to use /usr/bin/env rakudo
[14:13] *** Sgeo joined
[14:13] <Altreus> Is it better to add that bin dir to my $PATH instead?
[14:14] <Altreus> oh I bet what I previously did was make a raku dir and link *that* and then put that dir/bin into $PATH! Maybe I should just use rakubrew

[14:30] *** epony joined
[15:04] <Nemokosch> maybe you should :)
[15:15] <patrickb> Altreus: The archives in rakudo.org definitely have ZDF included. I suspect you missed to look in archive/share/perl6/site/bin/
[15:15] <patrickb> s/ZDF/zef/
[15:17] <patrickb> Also there is the set-env.sh script, which sets up the paths correctly (both bin/ and share/perl6/site/bin/)
