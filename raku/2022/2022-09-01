[15:00] <japhb> At least I'm not just horribly forgetful.  :-)

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I'm using NativeCall for this function: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regqueryinfokeya

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> the 3rd arg in that function takes a "pointer to a variable that specifies the size of the buffer"

[18:58] <tonyo> LPDWORD looks like it's just DWORD*, so you'd make and pass `DWORD lpcch_class; RegQueryInfoKeyA(..., ..., &lpcch_class, ...`
