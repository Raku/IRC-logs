[13:33] <tbrowder> .ask azawawi g'day, what timezone are you in?

[13:33] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to azawawi

[13:36] <[Coke]> Dumb IRC question: What does "(+Ziw)" mean in my irssi status bar?

[13:36] *** razetime_ left
[13:36] <dutchie> they are your user modes

[13:36] <dutchie> https://libera.chat/guides/usermodes explains what each one does

[13:37] <tbrowder> .tellable https://github.com/tbrowder/Mi6-Helper/

[13:39] <tbrowder> .weekly https://github.com/tbrowder/Mi6-Helper/

[13:41] <tbrowder> weekly https://github.com/tbrowder/Mi6-Helper/

[13:42] <tbrowder> whatever :-(

[13:50] *** razetime joined
[14:02] <[Coke]> dutchie: thanks!

[14:06] * [Coke] finds caller id modes, and wonders how many people get random private messages on libera. I don't think I've ever gotten one.

[14:08] <[Coke]> ... interesting. I'm still seeing network drops with my monitor (just using ping),  but I'm not seeing the drops here on irssi anymore.

[14:08] <[Coke]> until today, they were definitely correlated.

[14:11] <azawawi> hi

[14:11] <tellable6> 2022-09-30T13:33:14Z #raku <tbrowder> azawawi g'day, what timezone are you in?

[14:12] <azawawi> tbrowder: hi. It is +03:00

[14:13] <El_Che> you night owl

[14:13] <El_Che> solving perl and raku problems? :)

[14:13] <El_Che> (I read it as 3 am, I realize I am wrong :) )

[14:16] <azawawi> My time zone is +03:00 UTC

[14:16] <azawawi> so it is 17:16 here

[14:16] <El_Che> yeah, I got that on the second reading :)

[14:17] <El_Che> I am on +1, but we only differ 1 hour, yeah Summer Time :)

[14:18] <azawawi> https://github.com/azawawi/raku-godot-fun # 0.4.0 is out: Camelia in 3D with basic color materials :)

[14:21] <azawawi> Long time I have been away from Perl 6 which is raku now.

[14:21] <azawawi> It takes time to read raku code again. Lots of things to grasp.

[14:22] <japhb> azawawi: Welcome back, and good on you for doing graphics work!

[14:23] <azawawi> next up, animation player support. so you queue up some animations :)

[14:23] <azawawi> I thought of going the GDNative route but that's too much work

[14:24] <azawawi> To embed raku in Godot that is... like other languages

[14:27] <azawawi> One language we should learn from is Racket and DrRacket

[14:28] <azawawi> Documentation, tutorials and support for raylib and a gui toolkit outside of the box
