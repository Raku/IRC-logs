[01:12] <[Coke]> Have some nice utilities for work written in raku. given makes it very easy to manipulate nested hash structures, race & proc-async makes it very easy to interact with external commands.

[21:46] <melezhik> I am building Rakudo from source code on alpine OS / Azure docker container instance and wonder why it takes 10 minutes for 3 CPU / 7 GB docker container?

[21:46] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/e2ebd45f30e6ab4a0ca7486af08b80c7#file-gistfile1-txt-L74-L859

[21:47] <melezhik> could it be that building Rakudo could be slower when one builds on certain environment, like docker instance instead of VM or alpine os related ?

[21:48] <melezhik> the configuration is seen via the link

[21:53] *** Maylay left
[21:59] <japhb> melezhik: Huh.  I can see that it is building on x86_64, but that parsing performance looks like no JIT (how it would perform on an ARM, for instance).  Maybe the node had memory bandwidth contention?

[22:01] <melezhik> sorry for dummy question, what is memory bandwidth contention? so do you mean it might require more memory? or this is docker specific thing?

[22:02] <MasterDuke> you could probably speed up your moarvm build (but not nqp or rakudo) by manually calling `make install` instead of using `--make-install`, since then you could add something like `-j6` to parallelize it

[22:04] <melezhik> MasterDuke I suppose I use `make install` ? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml ?

[22:04] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/fastspec/blob/7c3fde1c79fec45bb2aa410be18d3a92bea6a926/sparky/fastspec/sparrowfile#L21

[22:04] <melezhik> sorry, the second link. is correct

[22:05] <MasterDuke> but that's rakudo's `make install`, not moarvm's

[22:06] <MasterDuke> btw, you could also speed up the moarvm build by using `--has-libtommath` and `--has-libuv` (assuming there are in fact os packages for them installed)

[22:08] <MasterDuke> i guess you could try putting something like `MAKEFLAGS=-j6` in the environment, maybe the moarvm build will pick that up

[22:08] <melezhik> MasterDuke what should be the command to build moar? I am not sure if I understand, I just follow Rakudo installation instruction

[22:08] *** jjido joined
[22:08] *** hythm left
[22:10] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure how to pass flags to the moarvm make call when using `--gen-moarvm`. `--moar-option='--has-libtommath'` works for moarvm's Configure.pl call, but i don't know about the `make` call

[22:11] <melezhik> so I am just doing this `perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar && make install`

[22:11] *** melezhik left
[22:16] *** Maylay joined
[22:17] <MasterDuke> you would probably need to choose/set a prefix manually, but you could do something like 'git clone MoarVM && cd MoarVM && perl Configure --prefix=/path/to/somewhere && make -j6 install && cd .. && git clone rakudo && cd rakudo && perl Configure --prefix=/same/path/to/somewhere --gen-nqp --backend=moar --make-install`

[22:54] <tonyo> you could pull them into your own image with a multistage build if that's what you're after melezhik
