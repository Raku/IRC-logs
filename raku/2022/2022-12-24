[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> haha, I did notice that there was some discrepancy with Positional and indexability, Associative and key lookup in codesections' article

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but this is deep in the fuzzy territory, just like there are no two people who would define a "container" the same way

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so I thought it was deliberate simplification or a doc error at worst
