[09:25] <tellable6> 2022-08-06T20:22:32Z #raku <vrurg> Nemokosch: another thing, a container may have a default value to which it is gets reset when assigned with Nil. From this perspective returning Nil also makes full sense.

[17:23] <lizmat> but that's it: there's no link, they're bound to the same container

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Util: I keep thinking about these permutable multiples and it seems to me that we missed that N %% 9 with the same logic
[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because once we deduced N %% 3, 3*N becomes divisible with 9 as well
[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and for 9, we can still calculate the remainder from the sum of the digits
