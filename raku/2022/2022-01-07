[22:35] <El_Che> when you ask for a coke in a bar/bistro/whatever and they serve pepsi for whatever reason, they warn you about it :)

[22:37] <SmokeMachine> Hi you all! As there is method implemented by Raku to class and token, role and regex implemented by regex to grammar, how can I create a custom-method-ish keyword to be implemented by a custom language to my custom class-ish?

[22:39] <japhb> El_Che: I think that's because they have no idea how people will react to getting a different cola than they expect.  I'm used to both Coke and Pepsi from dealing with the restaurant soda wars, and Royal Crown even at this point, for restaurants that elected to stay the heck out of it, but even so I occasionally get served something really odd and go "WTH is this?" and it turns out to be some local soda 

[22:39] <japhb> brewery or something

[22:41] <japhb> SmokeMachine: There's a lot of "custom"s there.  Did you write an internal or external DSL?

[22:45] <SmokeMachine> japhb: I’ve been planning on making this (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage) be defined by a string, né defined by code…

[22:59] <moon-child> japhb: presumably, rather than class A { method b { ... } }, custom-classish A { custom-methodish b { ... } }

[23:00] <moon-child> where the ... isn't a code block, but has its own grammar rules, as a regex

[23:10] <SmokeMachine> moon-child: exactly!

[23:11] <moon-child> (I have no idea how to do that, fwiw, but)

[23:17] <SmokeMachine> :(

[23:17] <SmokeMachine> Me neither… :(

[23:19] <Voldenet> define_slang with some additional declarators

[23:19] <Voldenet> I'm not sure how to do that, but it's something

[23:23] <Voldenet> mix in grammar rules for package_declarator:sym<custom-classish> routine_declarator:sym<custom-metodish> and then add actions

[23:27] <Voldenet> kind of similar thing: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Slang-Roman/blob/main/lib/Slang/Roman.rakumod

[23:30] *** linkable6 joined
[23:39] <SmokeMachine> For the classish I was thinking in using EXPORTHOW DECLARE as it's done on Red’s model (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red.pm6#L59)

[23:52] *** jjido left
[23:54] <Voldenet> but i'm not sure if you can define `has $a1 = #1.a;` then
