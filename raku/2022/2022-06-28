[03:46] <lucs> What's the difference (if any) between ÔΩ¢my Foo $bar = 42ÔΩ£ and ÔΩ¢my Foo() $bar = 42ÔΩ£? (that ÔΩ¢()ÔΩ£ has me confused).

[03:47] <japhb> "Can be cast to Foo" I believe

[03:47] <lucs> Hmm... Not sure what you mean...

[03:47] <japhb> Coerced, sorry

[03:48] <japhb> The first says "Is already type Foo (or a subclass or role composer, or whatever)"

[03:48] <japhb> The second merely says you can get to Foo() by pushing on it.

[03:48] <jdv> is it that "()" implies "action"

[03:49] <jdv> or something:)

[03:49] <japhb> This is used for example for IO(), which will take a Str (not an IO already), assume the string is a path, and convert it to an IO::Path -- which actually *is* an IO

[03:49] <japhb> Yeah

[03:52] <lucs> I'll reflect on that and ask again tomorrow if it's still unclear (when I'm sober that is).

[03:53] <jdv> good night

[04:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7cf264572: ( no output )

[04:27] <Voldenet> lucs: ^ the difference

[04:29] <Voldenet> in first case assigned value must be accepted by Foo, in the latter it can be coerced into Foo

[04:39] <Voldenet> imo coercing is usually like operator overloading - leads to surprising code and difficult to debug behaviours if you abuse it

[05:12] *** Furor is now known as Colere

[05:46] *** Garbanzo left
[05:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The question is, what counts as abuse

[05:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> as usual

[06:08] *** reportable6 left
[06:08] *** abraxxa joined
[06:09] *** reportable6 joined
[06:10] <Voldenet> the answer is fairly obvious, "using it when you don't need it" :)

[06:11] <Voldenet> like using shift left as stream writing operator

[06:11] <Voldenet> I'm glad that nobody would've considered that a good idea

[06:12] *** abraxxa left
[06:13] *** abraxxa joined
[06:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> regardless which operator it is, it did solve an actual problem compared to printf

[06:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> let alone in a low-level environment where you don't want to create unnecessary objects

[06:17] <Voldenet> just kidding, I still like it more than `format("%1% %2% %3%") % what % the % hell`

[06:20] <Voldenet> although `cout.say(1, 2, 3, 4).say(hex, setw(8), 42).say(3)` would sound more sane

[06:20] <Voldenet> and doesn't require magic operators

[06:21] <Voldenet> or `cout.say(what, " ", the, " ", hell)`

[06:41] *** Sgeo_ left
[06:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `cout.say(1, 2, 3, 4).say(hex, setw(8), 42).say(3)` this doesn't look sane for me at least üòõ

[06:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in fact, out of habit, I still use C-style format strings in Python xD

[06:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not always but definitely most of the time

[06:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> for C++, the key idea was that the "conversion" (which usually doesn't require memory allocation since it's not a real conversion) is given at compile time

[06:55] <Voldenet> it's sane imo because all of those are simple methods with obvious resolution

[06:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> indeed, they could use a method call, like cout.push(...).push(...)

[06:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and I think that would even work with templates

[06:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> although that would also kinda raise problems

[06:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because you'd still need to describe what can be pushed

[06:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> sure about either of those?

[06:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it looks like a chainable variadic method

[06:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why both chainable and variadic?

[06:57] <Voldenet> Well, variadic ‚Äì not necessarily

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, what is "hex, setw(8), 42"?

[06:59] <Voldenet> > say(digit_specifier, padding_specifier, number)

[07:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, if you have an integer

[07:00] <Voldenet> as C# have shown, `variadic` actually can mean defining methods with 1..4 args :D

[07:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> tbh if this is for integer only, maybe it doesn't even need an overload; it can be a standalone thing for integers

[07:02] <Voldenet> for std::floating_point you'd have something like std::hefloat here

[07:02] <Voldenet> hexfloat

[07:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, I'm not 100% sure you could define your own types on the fly with this

[07:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the operators are like cheating with global functions üòÑ

[07:05] <Voldenet> we're going too deep into C++ :P

[07:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yeah tbh I haven't used enough C++ for this

[07:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's just, there is a reason why noone else did this

[07:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and there is also a reason why _they_ in particular did this

[07:14] <Voldenet> well, the `say` would be not very useful without modern features
