[19:12] <hythm> hello, I have a program (uses NativeCall) that runs fine when run by raku built from `rakubrew build moar 2022.04` but behaves differently when run by raku built from `rakubrew download moar 2022.04` I think there is some issue with the pre-built packages on rakudo.org (which `rakubrew download` uses , I think). and this is for windows only, linux

[19:12] <hythm> packages are fine.  could that be something to do with nqp version? as `rakubrew build` builds nqp, while `rakubrew download` fetch pre built stuff.

[19:13] <hythm> here is the program, https://gist.github.com/hythm7/4c8707919d24179c74af7c15e81e41cc  when run with downloaded binaries it dies in line 126

[19:13] <El_Che> patrickb ==^

[19:17] <hythm> google search says the error code it dies with could be that `writefunction` sub is not returning the correct type

[19:21] <[Coke]> does nativecall type handling depend on the compiler you used to build?

[19:25] <hythm> not sure how to answer this question, when build rakudo and nqp locally using 'rakubrew build moar 2022.04' the programs runs fine and the return code is 0, when run the same program with downloaded rakudo from `rakudo.org, or from rakubrew download 2022.04` it dies with error code 23. (On windows only)

[23:14] <jujo> hello, I'm trying the SocketIO module to build a tool, for some reason when I follow the examples, it seems that the server expects to find a newline

[23:14] <jujo> or it is discarding the last character for some reason
