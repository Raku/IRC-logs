[09:03] <grondilu> what's the correct way to test whether a string is parsed by a grammar?  `so $grammar.parse($str)` or `$str ~~ /^<$grammar::TOP>$/` ?

[09:03] <grondilu> or something else?

[09:04] <grondilu> $str ~~ $grammar would make sense but I don't think that works

[09:04] <grondilu> m: say "foo' ~~ grammar { rule TOP { foo } }

[09:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Unable to parse expression in double quotes; couldn't find final '"' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> ay "foo' ~~ grammar { rule TOP { foo } }⏏<EOL>␤Other potential difficulties:␤    Useles…»

[09:04] <lizmat> I'm not sure I understand the word "test" in that question

[09:05] <grondilu> check, if you will

[09:05] <lizmat> $grammar.parse is just a method accepting a Str

[09:05] <grondilu> .parse it is then

[09:06] * lizmat feels like a rubber duck, but that's ok  :-)

[09:06] <grondilu> I thought it might be overkill or something

[09:06] <gfldex> m: say 'foo' ~~ grammar { rule TOP { foo } }.new;

[09:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «｢｣␤»

[09:07] <gfldex> I somehow feel this should work.

[09:07] <gfldex> m: grammar { rule TOP { foo } }.new.HOW.say;

[13:54] <grondilu> it does work for generic methods

[13:54] <grondilu> but not for new?

[13:55] <grondilu> I suppose the object is not yet fully constructed so it can't call downwards candidates or something?

[17:33] <grondilu> from the docs:  "A Submethod is a method that is not inherited by child classes."

[17:34] <grondilu> so I don't quite understand why the code above works as it does

[17:34] *** euandreh left
[17:34] <grondilu> shouldn't class B not know about the submethod defined in A?

[17:35] <lizmat> it's a role, not a class

[17:35] <lizmat> and they're both multis

[17:36] <lizmat> so the submethod in B does not shadow the one from the role A

[17:36] <lizmat> and you're calling without parameters, so that will call the one from the role A

[17:36] <lizmat> m:  class A { multi submethod new { samewith self, "foo" }; }; class B is A { multi submethod new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[17:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller new(B:U: ); none of these signatures matches:␤    (B: Str $s, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:37] <lizmat> grondilu  ^^

[17:37] * grondilu scraches his head

[17:38] <Voldenet> >it's somewhat confusing to read

[17:38] <Voldenet> ;)

[17:41] <grondilu> m: role A { multi method subnew { samewith "foo" }; }; class B does A { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[17:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[17:42] <lizmat> grondilu: because your B.new is also a multi, the .new() will dispatch to Any.new

[17:42] <grondilu> I see.  the constructor in B can still be a method.  I think that's what i want

[17:42] <lizmat> A common idiom is e.g.:

[17:43] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.foo; method new($foo) { self.bless(:$foo) } };  dd A.new(42)

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => 42)␤»

[17:44] *** euandreh joined
[17:44] <grondilu> yeah I know that idiom

[17:45] <grondilu> I write it quite a lot but I wanted a generic role with a default constructor.

[17:46] <grondilu> using a submethod one might do the job

[17:51] <Voldenet> Using factory method is other solution for this

[17:52] <Voldenet> m: sub new-something($type) { $type.new("foo") }; class B { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s; self.bless(); } }; new-something(B).say

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «foo␤B.new␤»

[17:53] <Voldenet> this massively reduces complexity, because custom constructor is decoupled from the class

[17:55] <grondilu> I like roles, though.  I like being able to write something that is very generic, and leave details to inheriting objects.

[17:59] <grondilu> I see raku's roles like C++'s abstract classes, but maybe that's a wrong comparison?

[17:59] <grondilu> s/like/as/

[18:01] <grondilu> well maybe it is, after all the point of roles is composition, now that I think about it.

[18:01] <grondilu> not inheritance.

[18:01] <lizmat> it's my understanding that you could see it that way... but then I'm no C++ expert

[18:02] <grondilu> m: class A { multi method new {...}; multi method new { samewith "foo" }; }; class B does A { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[18:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤A is not composable, so B cannot compose it␤at <tmp>:1␤»

[18:02] <grondilu> m: class A { multi method new {...}; multi method new { samewith "foo" }; }; class B is A { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[18:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Ambiguous call to 'new(B: )'; these signatures all match:␤  (A: *%_)␤  (A: *%_)␤  (Mu: *%attrinit)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:02] <grondilu> m: class A { multi method new { samewith "foo" }; }; class B is A { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[18:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Default constructor for 'A' only takes named arguments␤  in method new at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:03] <grondilu> m: class A { multi submethod new { samewith "foo" }; }; class B is A { multi method new(Str $s) { say $s } }.new

[18:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[18:03] <grondilu> yeah now I see I had no reason to use a role.  A class was good enough.

[18:03] <grondilu> so long as the generic constructor is a submethod

[18:05] <grondilu> ah I forgot to check A.new is called

[18:37] <Voldenet> grondilu: the C++ analogy makes it all confusing – derived methods are not going to be called properly in constructors

[18:39] <Voldenet> so `struct B { virtual void x() {} B() { x(); } }; struct D : public B { void x() { /* not going to be called */ }};`

[18:39] <Voldenet> however it would work in methods

[19:05] *** grondilu left
[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well, it won't be called if the call should take place in the base constructor

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> however, I think this is inherently a virtual method thing because virtual methods are "data"

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> (obviously it wouldn't even arise which function is called if x weren't virtual so there's that)

[19:11] <[Coke]> ... ugh. this API restricts you to get the first X elements... so you can't use the API to get all the data out. It's already paged... wtf.

[23:15] <tellable6> 2022-04-19T18:21:03Z #raku <melezhik> SmokeMachine - any success with SparkyCI?

[23:17] <SmokeMachine> .tell melezhik I'm trying... but it's odd: the build list says it has failed, but the report says all tests have passed

[23:17] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[23:29] <melezhik> SmokeMachine I see that, this is SparkCI bug

[23:29] <melezhik> I am working on it

[23:29] <melezhik> this is really weird, as this happens on and off and I can't nail it down )))

[23:30] <melezhik> so meanwhile, just look at the repot log ))), sorry for the inconvenience caused ...

[23:31] <melezhik> I changed build statuses in database manually to avoid confusion, but I need to figure out the cause ...
