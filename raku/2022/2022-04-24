[03:30] <bisectable6> guifa, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[03:30] <guifa> hythm no.  But there are still some gremlins in native int handling

[03:31] <hythm> guifa, it shows the error only with `int`, `Int` is ok

[03:32] <guifa> yes, that's what I said lol

[03:32] <guifa> Just confirmation that it's a problematic native int handling

[03:32] <hythm> haha yes, just confirming :D

[07:38] <nine> guifa, hythm: I'd guess it's something like during the compilation of the method, the attribute isn't fully set up yet, e.g. lacking the compile time value of the container. In that case there's a high chance, that the bug will go away with RakuAST. That's why I'd rather spend time on the latter than investigate this particular bug.

[11:53] <El_Che> for the comma ide people here: the intellij platform plays cats and mouse with the plugin: Plugin 'Comma Community Edition (Raku Language Support)' (version '2022.01.0') is not compatible with the current version of the IDE, because it requires build 213.* or older but the current build is IU-221.5080.210

[11:53] <El_Che> It may be a good idea to offer the plugin in the marketplace so it's automatically upgraded with the rest?
