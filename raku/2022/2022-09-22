[06:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't think there is a Digest::SHA module, it should be Digest::SHA1::Native

[07:41] <CIAvash> Sure, but it's not just a translation, specially the home and download pages.

[07:41] <CIAvash> https://www.raku-lang.ir/en/

[07:41] <CIAvash> It was supposed to be a replacement https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/158 then it became an alternative website

[08:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well Coke didn't know about it and said it should probably be noted that it's not an official site

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The other thing I wanted to ask is related to the site being more than a translation

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> If you have content ideas (like your community page is superior imo), please let the "official" doc staff know because it can be useful for raku.org as well

[08:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I realize that lack of communication is a problem within   content creators. There is also the site of altai-man, I wonder which will be the actually used site

[13:27] <patrickb> [Coke]_: Feel free to improve rakudo.org. I believe the Download page especially still has head room for improvement. My goal when creating the current one was listing all the options and nudging the user in the direction of the ones working best. Please do whip up a PR if you know how to improve it.

[13:30] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[13:33] <[Coke]_> patrickb: I think the easiest fix for linux downloads is to put the rakudo-pkg link *first*. I can do a PR for that, sure.

[13:34] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[13:49] *** Maylay joined
[13:49] <patrickb> [Coke]: Go ahead

[13:50] <[Coke]> there are 2 outstanding pull requests from months ago, be nice if those could be considered. (I am redoing my fork now, which may impact one of them.)

[13:53] <patrickb> [Coke]: I only see a single one about the libera chat move.

[13:58] <patrickb> And that's a single word change.

[13:59] <[Coke]> Yes, the other one just got removed because I had to update my fork (and the original one was against master)

[13:59] <[Coke]> I now have 2 in there.

[14:00] <patrickb> I'm unsure we're looking at the same thing. Can you provide a link?

[14:00] <patrickb> Do you have a commit bit?

[14:01] *** sena_kun left
[14:01] <[Coke]> no, or I'd just make these trivial changes.

[14:01] <[Coke]> (or merge my own prs after a suitable review period with no comments)

[14:01] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/pulls has 3 PRs.

[14:02] <patrickb> That's what I was about to suggest. Let's see ifcwe can do something about the commit bit...

[14:02] <[Coke]> 69, 86, 87 (one of which is a replacement for the old #80)

[14:03] <patrickb> Now I see them. Had to refresh...

[14:06] <patrickb> ping moritz or timo: Can you give coke a rakudo/rakudo.org commit bit?

[14:36] <moritz> it seems lizmat and myself can do that

[14:36] <moritz> [Coke]: what's your github username?

[14:38] <moritz> ah, seems to be "coke". Added.

[14:39] <tonyo> jjatria: http tiny is published

[14:39] <moritz> BTW, as a general statement, I seem to have admin privileges nearly everywhere still, even though I hardly do anything with raku anymore. I'm not mad if somebody removes my uber privs in the name of security

[14:39] <jjatria> Woo~

[14:39] <moritz> if, on the other hand, people find it nice to have somebody who can hand out privs, I can continue doing that

[14:40] <tonyo> jjatria: the problem was that it failed to write the main index.json but succeeded in the repo/H/TT/index.json and was refusing to re-index the module because it thought it had existed.  there is stuff in place now to actually try to prevent that from happening but because it wasn't there initially it ended up in that state

[14:40] <jjatria> Interesting

[14:41] <jjatria> So it _would_ have worked if I had bumped the version again?

[14:43] <patrickb> moritz: I think currently it's valuable to have you as in instance we can ask for privs. So I'm in favor of you keeping the admin privs.

[14:43] <patrickb> moritz: Thanks!

[14:44] *** Maylay left
[14:45] <patrickb> moritz: Btw. I fell short of grant reports in the last months. I did progress though. There should be a working instance up soon.

[14:49] <[Coke]> patrickb++

[14:49] <tonyo> jjatria: yea

[14:50] <[Coke]> having moritz around for privs is like having me around for clas, I guess. :|

[14:51] <moritz> [Coke]: an elegent weapon for a more civilized age? :-)

[15:12] *** Maylay joined
[15:19] <[Coke]> Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I want to depend on a minimum version in META6.json, I need something like 'depends: [ "Zef::Client:ver<0.14.2+>" ] ', yes?

[15:21] *** Maylay left
[15:25] *** Maylay joined
[15:45] <[Coke]> (Tried that locally, did 'zef install --deps-only .' and got a note that everything was already installed, which if the versions are consider, they are not.)

[15:59] <tonyo> ugexe: ^ that looks right to me 

[16:08] <[Coke]> (to be fair, 0.14.2 isn't released yet, so I may be expecting it to complain when it's telling me that it's done the best it can do, but I think a warning here would be correct)

[16:15] *** jetchisel left
[16:17] <tonyo> i'd expect that to error since it can't fulfil the request

[16:19] <tonyo> vrurg: any ideas on this? https://gist.github.com/tonyo-tatari/83dab91f40b0877640912f2261e71501

[16:21] <ugexe> yeah that should work, but 0.14.2 is already released. it looks like REA isn't indexing it though, so you can use the `--p6c` flag in zef to enable the old p6c ecosystem and grab it

[16:21] <ugexe> or install via url

[16:31] *** dakkar left
[16:34] *** jjido joined
[16:36] *** jjido left
[16:40] <ugexe> the reason its not failing is probably because you are doing `zef install .` on your distribution that itself is already installed

[16:40] <ugexe> hence it telling you everything is already installed

[16:41] <ugexe> it never reaches the point of checking dependencies because is-installed(YourModule:ver<whatever>) returns true

[16:42] <ugexe> if you bump the version in your META6.json it would have given you an error about not finding the dependency

[16:51] <[Coke]> ah, I didn't bump my version at the same time. good call

[17:19] <[Coke]> HOLY CRAP is this version faster.

[17:20] <ugexe> yeah, the previous version would re-parse an entire ecosystem worth of json each time it searched for direct dependencies

[17:20] <ugexe> although for the `zef` command that wont be any faster, since it only ever searches direct dependencies once

[17:20] <[Coke]> Dude. It's insane faster. took 10s of seconds for some of the bigger ones, PDF::Document now runs in < 5s

[17:21] <[Coke]> ugexe++

[17:24] <lizmat> tonyo: looks like a missing decont to me somewhere

[17:25] <lizmat> ugexe: so what isn't picked up by the REA ?

[17:25] <ugexe> zef v0.14.2 was released yesterday

[17:25] <lizmat> ah,.. I see... the harvester had died...  :-(

[17:27] <lizmat> it's in the REA now  :-)

[17:27] <[Coke]> dropped 0.9.4 of zef-deps which is now blazingly fast, ugexe++

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> pleasantpheasant - I've had the same issue, actually

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> re: certain modules including Digest::SHA not installing on windows

[17:36] <[Coke]> pretty nifty that I was able to spin up a decent sized box on azure and do a build and test things out for about 40 cents.

[17:38] <[Coke]> pleasantpheasant/Rog - can one of you open a ticket on the digest repo with the error? FWIW, I can reproduce it on windows with raku 2022.04.something

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> Sure

[17:41] <[Coke]> (closer to 30 cents if I didn't waste some time trying a too-small machine)

[17:42] <tonyo> lizmat: not sure where it'd decont anything, that's being thrown from gen/moar/Optimizer.nqp:2394 (updated gist with full ll-exception)

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-raku/issues/28

[17:48] <lizmat> tonyo: you could try putting in a: $block := nqp::decont($block) at the start of method visit_block and see if the problem goes away

[17:48] <lizmat> tonyo: so, did you build the QAST "yourself" ?

[20:25] <tbrowder> i copy the bash script and execute it as root. it looks like it’s doing the work but nothing gets installed in /opt

[20:25] <tbrowder> ideas?

[20:28] <tbrowder>  i have also updated apt, then searched for the rakudo-pkg with apt but nothing is found.

[20:29] <[Coke]> I can try on my ubuntu box, one sec.
