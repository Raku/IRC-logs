[00:37] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/1225 - bdf was looking for docs on various context. All seem to be checked off except "iterable". Anyone know what "iterable context" was referring to? (he said he pulled these terms from various things like the Syn.)

[00:41] <[Coke]> closed ticket.

[00:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ðŸ˜„

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perhaps it was like... `for`?

[00:54] <jaguart> or something like ``class Map does Associative does Iterable { }``

[00:56] <jaguart> which leads to role Iterable -> which talks about contexts where Iterable flattens?

[15:37] <lizmat> El_Che: in my experience, mastodon (at least in my browser) provides good translations to many languages, so I think that is not a big issue in reality

[15:44] <El_Che> (not on mine, but fair enough)

[15:46] <lizmat> https://mastodon.social/@nxadm@infosec.exchange/109342770810054491 gives me a very nice "Translate" button

[15:47] <El_Che> I went to that url in private mode, noting there

[15:48] <El_Che> nor in Chrome

[15:48] <El_Che> maybe a plugin?

[15:49] <lizmat> Safari ?

[15:49] <El_Che> let me open a mac

[15:49] <lizmat> and an old one at that

[15:50] <El_Che> nothing on this m1

[15:51] <El_Che> maybe it knows I understand dutch in the locale

[15:51] <lizmat> hmmm... indeed...  on my M1 on Monterey either

[15:51] <lizmat> maybe only when you're logged in ?

[15:52] <El_Che> does safari have plugins?

[15:52] <lizmat> it does, afaik, but I haven't installed any that I remember :-)

[15:52] <lizmat> yup, no "extensions" 

[15:57] <El_Che> the mac is pretty vanilla

[15:57] <El_Che> as a FF person, the only use I have for safari is Netflix

[15:58] <tonyo> do you leave drm disabled in ff?

[15:58] <lizmat> well, so is mine: I wonder if it is only offered when you're logged in?
