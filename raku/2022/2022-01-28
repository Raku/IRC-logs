[04:42] <guifa> is $*LANG.define_slang( 'MAIN', $*LANG.slang_grammar('MAIN').^mixin(…), $*LANG.slang_actions('MAIN').^mixin(…) ); still the correct way to do a slang?  I've tried it (even c&p code from recently published modules) but it doesn't seem to catch the new tokens

[15:34] <japhb> Gotta watch out for those pins, someone could step on them!  I mean, probably nothing compared to stepping on a Lego, but ....

[15:34] <perryprog> or a d4

[15:34] <japhb> *wince*  Yeah, definitely.  Those things are basically caltrops.

[15:35] <vrurg> In my childhood it was widely believed that pin's tiny end can travel the blood vessels all the way up to the heart. So, stepping over one was never an option! :)

[21:57] <gfldex> guifa: Did you create a Portuguese slang for Raku?

[21:59] <guifa> gfldex: one of these days maybe :-)
