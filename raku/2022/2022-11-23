[00:24] <ugexe> Inline::Perl5 probably

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Do you think it's worth porting?

[00:35] <ugexe> it would require porting OLE:: modules to interface with word files, which itself would be worth while

[00:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Jeff Goff had such a module

[03:50] <kybr> hello! its been a while. i am writing some Raku again. fun. 

[03:50] <kybr> m: given <1 2> { for .words { .^name.say; .say; .Numeric.say } }

[03:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17062c32f: OUTPUT: «Str␤1␤1␤Str␤2␤2␤»

[03:50] <kybr> that's what i expect

[03:50] <kybr> m: given <3> { for .words { .^name.say; .say; .Numeric.say } }

[03:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17062c32f: OUTPUT: «IntStr␤3␤0␤»

[03:50] <kybr> this is unexpected. 

[03:52] <kybr> can someone tell me why .Numeric.say gives me a 0 in the second case?

[04:14] <kybr> m: given <3> { for .comb(/ \S+ /) { .^name.say; .say; .Numeric.say } }

[09:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> kybr: first off, I'd say your code is a bad idea - <1 2> is a list and <3> is an IntStr, especially for the former, you have no reason to call .words on it and it's sheer luck that it worked

[09:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> second, you can be right regardless that calling words on IntStr gives a weird result. I think it's Str.words that gets called and probably it simply wasn't ready to support an IntStr

[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't be surprised if this was a general semantics problem of allomorph types - once you start to use it as a certain one of its supported types, you are gonna lose a lot of information required for other types

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the reason comb works right is probably that it has a method on Allomorph that takes precedence over the method on Str

[20:40] <ToddAndMargo> What am I doing wrong here?    `$Win64Bit =Q["C:\Program Files (x86)"].IO.d.Boo`; gives me

[20:40] <ToddAndMargo> Failed to find 'K:\Windows\NtUtil\"C:\Program Files (x86)"' while trying to do '.d'

[20:41] <ToddAndMargo> How did `Q["C:\Program Files (x86)"]` turn into `K:\Windows\NtUtil\"C:\Program Files (x86)"`?  Why is it appending my current working directory into the path?

[20:42] <ToddAndMargo> I figured it out.  It does not like the path quoted
