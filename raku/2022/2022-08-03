[08:46] <Nemokosch> The module resolution seems to fail on non-ascii paths and this seems to be a Rakudo thing; zef handles the path properly

[08:46] <lizmat> ?

[08:47] <Nemokosch> modules happen to be installed under your personal folder

[08:47] <Nemokosch> think about what happens if your username happens to be, for example, Márton

[08:48] <Nemokosch> this is possible on Windows for sure, idk for POSIX systems

[08:48] <Nemokosch> so yes, zef finds the folder and installs stuff under I think .raku nicely

[08:49] <lizmat> well, if it doesn't work, it's a bug, because it is supposed to work

[08:49] <Nemokosch> however, if I try to run the script that depends on the certain module, the error log shows that it tried to resolve some garbage version

[09:04] *** kolofon joined
[09:06] <Nemokosch> interesting... the output seems to be different today

[09:06] <Nemokosch> maybe the restart made a difference?

[14:31] <El_Che> colomon: by coincidence I watchted the Valiant episode yesterday :)

[14:32] <colomon> I've wandered into some weird Inline::Perl5 hell.  Was trying to convert a short Perl 5 script that works on my machine to Raku.  Started by just slapping :from<Perl5> on the use statements.  This worked for two uses, failed for the third, as it was unable to find the module.  Eventually noticed the @INC list it showed was trying to search a

[14:32] <colomon> bunch of non-existent directories that appeared to be for an earlier version of P5.  So I tried uninstalling Inline::Perl5 and reinstalling it -- but now it won't build at all?

[14:32] <colomon> Aborting due to build failure: Inline::Perl5:ver<0.59>:auth<github:niner> (use --force-build to override)

[14:33] <lizmat> nine I think it might need a bump ?

[14:36] <colomon> How do I even tell what's going wrong in any detail?

[14:39] <lizmat> colomon: what version of Rakudo are you on ?

[14:40] <colomon> Built on MoarVM version 2022.04.

[14:41] <colomon> (errr, v2022.04)

[14:41] <colomon> I mean Rakudo v2022.04

[14:47] <[Coke]> could run the tests with --verbose, maybe?

[14:47] <[Coke]> (I assume you're doing a zef install?)

[14:49] <colomon> yes, zef

[14:52] <colomon> wasn't able to figure out how to do that directly, just did zef look to get into the Inline-Perl5-0.59 source.  There   zef test .   works fine.

[14:52] <colomon> zef build .  # fails with the same error

[14:56] <colomon> zef --verbose build .

[15:12] <[Coke]> oh - someone removed the parrot foundation from wikipedia. There goes my claim to fame.

[15:12] <colomon> Never went to Chicago for Perl, was probably Columbus YAPC circa 2009ish?

[16:17] <colomon> but if I leave off the --verbose there, I don't get the command its complaining about at all.

[16:20] <colomon> zef --version returns v0.13.8

[16:22] <[Coke]> sounds pretty current. :)

[16:25] <ugexe> i dont think the output command for Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON can be run as shown (only for the more common Builder.pm based dists). In the command shown its expecting $*IN.slurp(:close) to read in META6.json data as a raku hash

[16:28] <ugexe> you'd also need to use single quotes, not double quotes

[16:31] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/DistributionBuilder.rakumod#L16-L31

[16:32] <ugexe> putting that synopsis code in the root of the inline::perl5 repo and running it should do the same thing

[16:39] <colomon> ugexe Assuming you meant the code in yellow highlighting there, I get a similar but slightly different error

[16:39] <colomon> Command: /Users/colomon/tools/rakudo-moar-2022.04-01-macos-arm64-clang/bin/rakudo -I/Users/colomon/.zef/tmp/Inline%3A%3APerl5%3Aver%3C0.59%3E%3Aauth%3Ccpan%3ANINE%3E.tar.gz/Inline-Perl5-0.59 -MMONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL -e exit((require

[16:40] <colomon> Something went wrong

[16:40] <ugexe> presumably there is no output from Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON then

[16:41] <[Coke]> I'm confused - why are you trying to run these commands by hand and not let zef do it?

[16:42] <colomon> because zef fails when it runs them

[16:42] <[Coke]> When I first suggested verbose, I was thinking you'd pass it in, get extra diag output, and we'd be looking at that.

[16:42] <ugexe> i think they were just confirming that zef wasn't swallowing some output that would reveal the issue

[16:42] <[Coke]> ahhh

[16:42] <colomon> the only useful thing verbose returned was the command that was failing to run

[16:44] <ugexe> that means no output came from https://github.com/niner/Distribution-Builder-MakeFromJSON

[17:52] <pamplemousse> I'm currently dipping my toes back into the world of Raku by way of working through some of the issues marked "easy to resolve" and was wondering if I could some pointers. Namely, the one I'm working on requires me to read through some NQP code, and I'm a little lost on the syntax.

[17:53] <pamplemousse> Does anyone know of a specific doc that would be good for me to read through to get a crash course in NQP?

[17:53] <pamplemousse> lizmat: Ooo, sounds like a fun time!

[17:53] <lizmat> if it's syntax..  

[17:54] <lizmat> it's like Raku but a *lot* simpler

[19:16] <ugexe> one reason is its often easier to audit a couple lines of code than a full distribution. if a developer doesn't audit their dependencies they wont have that problem
