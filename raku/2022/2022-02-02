[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Oh and regarding the article
[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> As a Martin Luther King paraphrase: _I have a nightmare_
[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and that nightmare is that by the time Raku will be production-ready enough, other established trending languages will just catch up in terms of functionality
[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> one can say that those languages still won't be as consistent as Raku but as we know, money talks, trends talk, so that wouldn't matter at that point
[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> if that happens, then it would mean we'll just have "perl" everywhere
[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> the dream
[15:53] * guifa is currently trying to clean it up so that others (cough SmokeMachine cough) can take advantage of it
[15:53] <SmokeMachine> \o/
[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think "perl" is more than a set of rational features, that's what I see in the whole community
[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's a bit like... a cult, in a non-pejorative way
[16:00] <guifa> lizmat when running Rakudo on RAST, will each action method return a RAST Node, or will they still be ultimately returning QAST stuff ?
[16:02] <guifa> asking because right now I'm "cheating" by calling $*PACKAGE.^add_method() in the action method to attach, but I'm not sure the best way to install, say, a sub into the lexical scope, since there's no $*SCOPE.^add_sub() method

[16:07] <El_Che> damn, rakudo-pkg is getting a little too popular:  The open-source bandwidth usage (75.61%) for your [organization] nxadm (@nxadm-pkgs) has exceeded an alert threshold (75.00%)! 
[16:07] <El_Che> getting a warning from the repo hosting
[16:16] <El_Che> I think CI is starting to use it more widely. Yesterday we did 45 gig transfer
[16:17] <guifa> 45 Gig?  wow
[16:17] <El_Che> normally I have a allowance of 200 gig /month
[16:18] <El_Che> the first time I hit a warning threshold
[16:20] <El_Che> (we are the 2nd, is what has me worries)
[16:20] <El_Che> d
[16:27] <El_Che> sadly, more detailed stats are for the paying non-oss versions
[16:27] <El_Che> so I pinged their support
[16:27] <El_Che> to have a look
[16:37] <El_Che> "From our analysis of the traffic it indicates that there are thousands of Ubuntu 18.04 instances (we've counted at least 3k unique IPs), that are hitting Debian indexes in your repo"
[16:37] <El_Che> 3k different IPs does not sound like a CI gone crazy
[16:38] <MasterDuke> but 18.04 is pretty old
[16:39] <El_Che> "A runaway CI job was something we considered, but yes the 3k IPs may indicate something else is happening. Our team is actively looking into the issue, trying to find some commonality or a potential source for the traffic."
[16:39] <El_Che> maybe someone is trying to DDOS us?
[16:39] <El_Che> who did we/me piss off today :P
[16:40] <MasterDuke> what did the groundhog predict? did he use raku to make that prediction?
[16:41] <El_Che> afk for a while
[16:41] <El_Che> mayne 2022 is just the year of raku :)

[17:13] <guifa> If anyone more skilled than me with the inner workings of Raku(do) wants to help me beef up that module, I'm trying to work it into one that guides others to the best ways to do stuff
[17:15] * guifa . o O ( slash help me get binex to 100% haha)

[17:53] <guifa> ugexe: I dunno what happened with the commit — you can see .precomp is literally in the .gitignore =\ 
[17:53] <guifa> (ditto for idea)
[17:53] <ugexe> probably added it before you added the .gitignore entry
[17:54] <guifa> yeah, that may be it.  I used the GUI to create a repository, and I guess it immediately registered all the files.  Normally I start with an empty one and then populate, did the reverse this time because this was originally gonna be a throwaway project lol
[17:55] <ugexe> you also have two initial commits, only added the .gitignore on the second one
[17:55] <ugexe> and commits lib/.precomp on the first one

[18:42] <theangryepicbana> El_Che: btw the issue with rakudo-pkg has been figured out, someone dumb was using repl.it (which I help out with sometimes) to download and update every package from apt
[18:43] <El_Che> it looks like they did mostly apt-get update and no or a few installs
[18:43] <theangryepicbana> (every replit project has a unique-ish IP, hence all the IPs)
[18:43] <theangryepicbana> yeah we're working on a fix for it, sorry for the trouble!
[18:44] <El_Che> thanks for keeping me in the loop
[18:44] <theangryepicbana> ye
[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <theangryepicbanana#8297> (just curious, does the discord bridge still work?)
[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <theangryepicbanana#8297> no it does not, great
[18:47] <theangryepicbana> oh apparently the bridge does work, it just takes a while
