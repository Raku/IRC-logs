[15:29] <tbrowder> .ask ugexe when using zef's uninstall for an installed module, is there any way to have zef uninstall that module's dependencies that are not required by any other installed modules?

[15:29] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[15:31] <ugexe> tbrowder: no, and there isn't really a way to determine what those are

[15:31] <ugexe> you can have optional runtime dependencies for example

[15:32] *** wingfold joined
[15:34] <ugexe> plus repos can depend on things from upstream repos which further complicates what that even means

[17:17] <tellable6> 2020-08-07T15:40:10Z #raku <ab5tract> lichtkind a bit unfair for Num to be "wrong", but also slow at being so :)

[21:29] <uzl[m]> If so, why does this commit (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/175e716f) states "This commit changes &[max] so that it returns its RHS in the case of ties."?

[21:29] <uzl[m]> Shouln't it be "This commit changes &[max] so that it returns its LHS in the case of ties."?

[21:53] <hythm> Hello, I was reading the "did you know?" section of the weekly which talking about fiiltering arrays. I'm wondering why the name `grep` was chosen, should not grep have a different more general name? as grep, I think,¬† is associated more with text or regexp

[21:58] <hythm> I think 'filter' suits the current 'grep' functionality more. And 'grep' could be suited more for a `Str` method

[22:30] <tellable6> guifa, I'll pass your message to hythm

[22:31] <guifa> hythm: Perl used grep way back in the day, and so Raku (originally conceived as a future version of Perl) similarly used it
