[06:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Hello bello

[06:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I have a question. What happens when there is a name conflict between global stuff and an Enum value?

[08:03] <lizmat> m: enum Foo <True False>; say 42 if False

[08:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4f519c2ea: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[08:04] <lizmat> remember, it's all lexical in Raku, so they will override the global meaning in the lexical scope they're defined

[08:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> now here is the thing

[08:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I had an enum that I tried to use for CLI

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one of the values was Label

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the CLI wouldn't accept that value

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and then I noticed that Label exists globally

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> all the other values worked but Label

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why is that?

[08:09] *** dakkar joined
[08:19] *** dakkar left
[08:19] <moritz_> you do things like OUTER: for @list -> $x { for @other -> $y { next OUTER if $x == $y; ... }}. In this case, OUTER is a Label

[08:20] <moritz_> *you can do

[08:20] *** dakkar joined
[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's okay but I just want either Label to work as an Enum name from the CLI as well, or get some proper feedback about what goes wrong when trying to pass it üòÖ

[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this isn't specific to Label but any global non-keyword name

[10:48] <leont> Nemokosch: It will probably work if you use Getopt::Long üòâ

[10:48] <tellable6> leont, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm curious about what actually happened

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> But thanks for the advice, it can come handy, especially if others don't like the default argument parsing
