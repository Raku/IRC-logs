[00:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @japhb Mmm... unfortunately Raku CBOR is still slow compared to Python (â‰ˆ 40 time slower.)

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @japhb Of course, thanks working on "CBOR::Simple" ! And thanks again for bringing my attention to it!

[00:59] <japhb> Anton Antonov: Not terribly surprised, especially if you were unable to use packed array types.  CBOR::Simple is (I believe) the fastest structured data codec in Raku-land ... but that doesn't make its JSON-like data as fast as tuned Python code.  OTOH, it *might* have better fidelity -- Raku has a richer builtin type library than most languages, thus being able to round trip Rat and Capture and such.

[11:27] <tellable6> 2020-08-20T06:44:00Z #raku-dev <patrickb> .tell pmurias If you find the time I'd value your insights on https://github.com/Raku/nqp/issues/656

[11:27] <tellable6> 2020-10-27T01:48:00Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> .tell pmurias there are some js specific opcodes at https://gist.github.com/coke/f87ab505c6cb825db51afcb5cb6a8990 like "attrhintfor" that could use some docs.

[11:27] <tellable6> 2020-10-27T01:52:00Z #raku-dev <[Coke]> .tell pmurias I mean like asyncreadbyte

[11:29] <pmurias> anything cool has been recently happening in raku land?

[11:30] <lizmat> pmurias: if the tellable6 response is any indication, you missed the new coerce protocol, the work on RakuAST and the IRC logs server https://irclogs.raku.org

[11:30] <lizmat> pmurias: good to see you, hope you are well!

[11:31] <AlexDaniel> probably wasn't that long, it's just that tellable still has some messages it's unsure about if it delivered them

[11:33] <pmurias> lizmat: nice to see you too, hope you are doing well too

[11:33] <lizmat> as well as I can, without current parameters  :-)

[11:34] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: oooooo, https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/live.html is faaaancy

[11:34] <AlexDaniel> really cool

[11:34] <lizmat> thank you  :-)

[11:36] <AlexDaniel> and the search function works! ðŸ˜Œ

[11:36] <AlexDaniel> that's all I could possible wish for wrt irc logs

[11:36] <AlexDaniel> ok maybe one more thing is search across multiple channels

[11:37] <lizmat> yeah... that's tricky...  you just have to change channel to repeat the same search though

[11:38] <lizmat> you would need a whole new display mechanism to show results from different channels.... and scrolling would be hell to implement

[11:38] <AlexDaniel> aaa yeah indeed

[11:39] <AlexDaniel> are you taking feature requests? :)

[11:39] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/App-Raku-Log/issues

[11:39] <lizmat> I also take PR's  :-)

[16:50] *** sena_kun left
[16:52] <ugexe> not sure if its worth mentioning, but one of the reasons the file names get mangled is so that files can be referenced by their case-sensitive name even on case-insensitive file systems

[16:52] <guifa> and probably also makes life easy if names are non-ASCII too
