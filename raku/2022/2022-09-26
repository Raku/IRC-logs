[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's the difference between `if my $var = some-value` and `if some value -> $var`?

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the omission of the hyphen in the second version was accidental

[15:14] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[15:15] <Juerd> With "if my $var = 42 { ... }", $var will still exist after that block, with "if 42 -> $var { ... }', $var will exist only in the block.

[15:17] <Juerd> I'd say the former should probably never occur. It's something you'd write in other languages, where that syntax would be severely special cased to restrict the variable to the block. If you really want the variable to exist outside of the conditional, it would be clearer to human readors to declare it in a separate statement before the "if".

[15:17] <Juerd> s/reador/reader/

[15:20] <tbrowder> hi, i’m having trouble parsing a .gitconfig file with either Config::INI or App::Mi6::INI. i have been using % but haven’t tried $

[15:20] <leont> Also, I think the latter does a bind, which can matter in some circumstances

[15:21] <leont> But yeah, generally speaking the second form should be preferred

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh well, actually I have seen the former in mi6 itself, that's why I asked... made me feel uncertain. Thank you anyway

[15:23] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/09/26/2022-39-upcoming-hacking/

[17:18] <tellable6> 2022-09-25T22:32:46Z #raku <tbrowder> tonyo is it possible to use fez in a github workflow test? mine is failing, as expected, but a fake account for testing would be handy if it could be done securely. hm, maybe i should check its docs  :-)

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's the difference between `int` and `Int` in Rakudo code? I can see both.

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Back to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Rakudo/Internals/JSON.pm6

[18:37] <tonyo> int is native and Int is not

[18:40] <tonyo> same with str/Str and num/Num

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Hm, okay. Do you know why $spacing is passed as native int but $level is passed as the wrapped type? Maybe it is because $spacing is passed to an nqp sub at some point?

[18:41] <[Coke]> so int should be more compact, work better with JIT if it's enabled...

[18:42] <tonyo> nemokosch: most likely.  working with them is more tedious but is faster (at least for the time being)

[18:42] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> (Int) cannot be unboxed to int. Tbh I could have anticipated this and saved like 10 minutes of building a nice definedness-oriented interface...

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> although... actually I don't understand how that to-json method works. How can an int value be optional? Only by not passing the named argument at all, right?

[23:18] <AlexDaniel> well, the good news is that you can reinstalled all of the potentially useful modules from the ecosystem just by installing whateverable…

[23:18] <AlexDaniel> can reinstall*

[23:18] <[Coke]> instructions for blin will cause what* to get installed as a module.
