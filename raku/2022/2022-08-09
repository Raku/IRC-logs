[08:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I was thinking... is there a way on rak to have default parameters? Something like an anonymous tag that would always be applied? like an alias with the same name of the command (`alias rak="rak --my --default --parameters`). Or is that not needed?

[08:15] <lizmat> I was thinking about adding default parameters at some point

[08:16] <lizmat> until then, you could --save all your default parameters in a single option, and always apply that option (either directly or through an alias)

[08:16] <lizmat> rak --foo --bar --baz --save=d

[08:17] <lizmat> rak -d ...

[08:18] <SmokeMachine> :+1

[08:19] <SmokeMachine> üëç

[08:20] <SmokeMachine> and another question, is there a way of (as you did with --pattern) to have an attribute for the path ran will search on? that way I could do something like: `rak --red ...` and independently of where I am, search on Red repo...

[08:21] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: ‚òùÔ∏è

[08:21] <lizmat> --files-from=   --paths-from=  ?

[08:22] <SmokeMachine> thanks! I missed that!

[08:25] <SmokeMachine> and it seems there is something wrong on the list of predefined groups (https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak#--extensionsspec), for some reason #ruby is being shown <#ruby> (or I've misunderstood the reason for that).

[08:29] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: and the last suggestion (sorry for keep bothering you), would that make sense on the documentation, group the parameters by context instead of sorting them alphabetically?

[08:30] <lizmat> well, I see the README as the source of documentation of the module, aka "sub rak"

[08:30] <lizmat> the user documentation I see as what you get with --help

[08:30] <lizmat> and that *is* grouped by context

[08:31] <lizmat> see e.g. rak --help input

[08:33] <SmokeMachine> I keep looking more at https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak than at --help, every time I'm on twitter on my phone and I see a new release, I got there to see the news...

[08:33] <SmokeMachine> but that makes sense

[08:33] <lizmat> well, you can check https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak/changes

[08:35] <lizmat> I hope that rak will be used by people who are not necessarily into raku (yet), so will use --help, or maybe a man page

[08:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> where does the changes section come from?

[08:36] <lizmat> it's manually maintained?   App::Mi6 forces you to create a new entry before you're allowed to release  :-)

[08:36] <lizmat> which I think is a good thing  :-)

[08:37] <SmokeMachine> I do... but then I got through the options to remember then

[08:37] <SmokeMachine> sorry, another feature request... could `~` be expanded when `--files-from`? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NjPAQJm7/CleanShot%202022-08-09%20at%2009.36.12%402x.png

[08:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is App::Mi6 in the first place? üòÖ

[08:40] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: something seems wrong https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/QqYu7tL9/CleanShot%202022-08-09%20at%2009.39.48%402x.png

[08:42] <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: https://raku.land/cpan:SKAJI/App::Mi6

[08:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> what's the difference between declarators `package` and `module`?

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh this is interesting

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> from https://design.raku.org/S11.html#Modules, i thought you cannot export from `package`-declared things, but i tried and it works :p

[08:55] *** renormalist joined
[09:09] <lizmat> Nahita  you don't even need a package, you just need a compilation unit

[09:09] <lizmat> to be able to export stuff

[09:11] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: is that with --files-from or --paths-from ?

[09:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: that was with: `rak --files-from=/Users/fernandooliveira/Red/ --save=red`

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> so there's no difference between `package { }` and `module { }`?

[09:28] *** Kaipei joined
[09:35] <lizmat> the difference is in HOW

[09:35] <lizmat> m: dd (package A { }).HOW

[09:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10feda116: OUTPUT: ¬´Perl6::Metamodel::PackageHOW.new‚ê§¬ª

[09:36] <lizmat> m: dd (module A { }).HOW

[09:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10feda116: OUTPUT: ¬´Perl6::Metamodel::ModuleHOW.new‚ê§¬ª

[09:43] *** sena_kun joined
[09:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> thanks. i still have no idea what's the difference other than they have different names.

[09:55] <Altreus> Er, how do I correctly spell: sub new (%args) ?

[09:56] <Altreus> If I do that, it complains that "too few positionals passed"

[09:56] <Altreus> I used to do sub new (|%args) so that the provided list got turned into %args but that is obsolete and failed to compile

[10:04] <lizmat> Altreus: %*args ?

[10:04] <lizmat> aka a slurpy hash ?

[10:04] <Altreus> ah, maybe! I try

[10:05] <Altreus> oh wait, *%args, right?

[10:05] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: 0.46 or rak should have home dir expansion

[10:05] <lizmat> Altreus: yeah, duh, sorry, too many distractions  :-)

[10:06] <Altreus> that's the bunny, thanks :D

[10:06] <Altreus> forgot about slurpy

[10:11] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: with --files-from it expects to get files

[10:11] <lizmat> with --paths-from, it will treat any directories for recursive searches

[10:11] <lizmat> so I guess you need --paths-from

[10:25] *** spacekookie left
[10:25] *** spacekookie joined
[10:30] <SmokeMachine> I've tested with both wit the same result

[10:40] <lizmat> what does 'rak --red --list-expanded-options  say ?

[10:49] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/34klECSA/CleanShot%202022-08-09%20at%2011.49.39%402x.png

[10:50] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: ‚òùÔ∏è

[10:52] <lizmat> ok, I think there's one level of indirection that your missing

[10:53] <lizmat> both --files-from and --paths-from take a *file* of which the contents will list either filenames or paths to search

[10:55] *** Kaipei is now known as Kaiepi

[10:55] <SmokeMachine> hum... ok, the error makes sense then... is there a way to pass a dir?

[10:56] <lizmat> well, put that dir in a file, and mention that file with --paths-from

[10:56] <lizmat> but I just realized that you cannot specify a ~/file with --paths-from yet

[11:00] <lizmat> but with 0.47 (now on zef) you can

[11:00] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: so, create a file ~/redpaths with .../Red in it

[11:01] <lizmat> and then --paths-from=~/redpaths

[11:07] <SmokeMachine> yes, `rak "ResultSeqSeq" --paths-from=<(echo ~/Red/)` seem to work... I'll create the file...

[11:10] <SmokeMachine> thanks

[18:34] <ugexe> [Coke]: afaik that error is a rakudo bug. the zef logic related to that is just https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7c46ca2d5a1f78c86a5c543c4080774b30770ddb/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/curl.rakumod#L70-L73

[18:35] <ugexe> no one has ever been able to reliably reproduce it, but the logic in zef that would lead to that error is basic enough to be confident the problem lies in rakudo somewhere

[22:34] <ingy> that's how I set up all of raku

[22:34] <ingy> suggestions welcome

[22:39] <japhb> ingy: Just add the site bin to where you set up the PATH.  Here's how I calculate it in the perl5 script that helps me bootstrap rakudo:

[22:39] <japhb>     my $site     = `$raku -e 'print CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.repository-for-name("site")'`;

[22:39] <japhb>     my $site_bin = "$site/bin";

[22:42] <ingy> I set up the path elsewhere. already fixed.

[22:42] <ingy> was just wondering if that's a same raku/zef setup
