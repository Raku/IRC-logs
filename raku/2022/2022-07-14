[07:34] <discord-raku-bot> <kaestral> hey, question. ik Gnome::Gtk4 is in private development; are there any other bindings for gtk4 at this time? i love raku, and libadwaita, and would love to marry the two

[11:39] <patrickb> kaestral: I think the bindings by martimm are the only ones aiming at gtk4. I encourage you to ping them about gtk4. I think hearing from users is always encouraging

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> gfldex: tx! I learned a lot - what language contracts do and my first steps to consider using the MOP (although I would say that class MyType {} would have answered the OP without the MOP)

[18:39] <tonyo> .

[18:40] <guifa> any chance you saw that odd enumerated class thing?  It feels buggy (or at least, in undefined behavior territory), and I figured you'd know better than anyone if I need to file an issue
