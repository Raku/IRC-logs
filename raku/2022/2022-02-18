[14:40] <kawaii_> Any ideas why this type check fails and complains about being fed a UUID when well... That's exactly what it's supposed to be? `Type check failed in assignment to $!uuid; expected UUID but got UUID (UUID.new(bytes => Bu...)` / `my $user = User.^load(uuid => %request<auth>);`, in this case `%request<auth>` is technically a string I guess but it should validate as a UUID... I also tried `my $user = User.^load(uuid => UUID.new(%request<auth>));` 

[14:40] <kawaii_> but for some reason UUID complains about being passed multiple arguments when I clearly have only passed it one.

[14:46] <lizmat> does running with --ll-exception provide any pointers?

[14:49] <kawaii_> hmm the error output looks no different with that flag added 

[14:49] <kawaii_> I'll make a paste with more complete code in a moment

[14:49] <lizmat> you should have more  :-)    

[14:49] <lizmat> ok

[14:51] <kawaii_> I stripped out anything irrelevant https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eXJq1i1B/

[14:52] <kawaii_> %request<auth> contains a string which in this case is a UUID-like object, and my database does indeed contain a single entry in the User model with a valid UUID in the uuid column 

[14:54] <lizmat> kawaii_: perhaps better asked on #cro  :-)

[14:55] <kawaii_> I had a slight suspicion Cro might be responsible for my issue, I'll go bother them soon if I don't make any progress myself :) 

[14:56] <lizmat> kawaii_: also, make sure you have the latest versions of IO::Socket::Async::SSL and HTTP:HPACK

[14:56] <lizmat> if you're using 2022.02

[14:56] <japhb> kawaii_: Actually, on #red might be good too.  Does Red know how to inflate/deflate a UUID from the DB?

[14:57] <guifa> Is it possible there are two separate UUID classes?  (maybe one from Red and one from Cro?)

[14:57] <kawaii_> ugh, that's a good point

[14:59] <guifa> i haven't yet jumped into either yet, but UUID is one of those things that's so simple I can see many people making one to avoid dependency hell.  Maybe if you use UUID(Str()) ?

[15:00] <guifa> Clunky but I'd assume any UUID package could coerce to-from strings

[15:02] <kawaii_> guifa: interesting, `Impossible coercion from 'Str' into 'UUID': no acceptable coercion method found`

[15:02] <guifa> lol someone needs to update their UUID to add a COERCE method hahaha

[15:02] <guifa> (sorry, that's not helpful for you though righ tnow)

[15:11] <Altreus> Maybe Raku should try new as one of its coercion methods :)

[15:12] <lizmat> it is!  it coerces a type object into an instance!  :-)

[15:12] <Altreus> gosh
