[13:12] <tellable6> 2022-11-07T23:20:06Z #raku <sena_kun> [Coke] I certainly did, I believe.

[13:13] <sena_kun> [Coke], I wonder if there are any objections of replacing it with raku.land.

[13:18] <[Coke]> I have no issue with using one over the other (I ended up at modules because I googled something)

[13:18] <[Coke]> if the bug fix is "shut down that site and push people to the other one", I'm ok with that.

[13:19] * [Coke] opens a very small PR for Text::Markdown

[13:19] <[Coke]> sena_kun: one of those changes is to fix the markdown for your github id.

[14:41] <avuserow> Speaking of modules, how often does zef update cpan modules? I uploaded Aduio::TagLib a few days ago and zef only sees 0.0.2. modules.raku.org says I have 0.0.3

[14:42] <avuserow> I know fez is the new preferred place, but is cpan this deprecated now?

[14:44] <japhb> lizmat: What is the default file selection in rak?  rak --rak only shows me it's a Callable, and a general search missed things I expected to see.  (In particular, it missed files with the 'js' extension that were outside of node_modules or any other such black holes.)

[16:10] <ugexe> avuserow: its in the old cpan index (which can be reenabled with --cpan argument), but its not showing up by default because its missing in the indexer that replaced it (REA) https://github.com/Raku/REA/tree/main/meta/A/Audio::TagLib

[16:11] <ugexe> --cpan will give it access to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/master/cpan.json (which might even be what modules.raku.org uses)

[16:25] <lizmat> japhb: the default selection is "all known extensions".  .js isn't one them atm

[16:25] <lizmat> I guess I'll add a #js group with .js   any other extensions I should add with that?

[16:26] <lizmat> .css maybe ?  as part of the #html group ?

[16:43] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke self-assigned Tagging, versioning and releases https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2690

[17:07] <japhb> lizmat: .ts for TypeScript also?

[17:07] <lizmat> ack

[17:08] <lizmat> will be in the next release

[17:08] <lizmat> probably later today

[17:08] <tonyo> .ts for typescript and if you're trying to support stuff like react then .tsx

[17:08] <avuserow> I can definitely move my modules to zef.

[17:08] <japhb> lizmat: Might make a separate #css group, because .css,.scss,.sass, etc.

[17:09] <avuserow> Is the zef ecosystem code available anywhere, out of curiosity?

[17:09] <japhb> (That's from old memory, haven't written non-pure-CSS in a while.)

[17:12] <tonyo> avuserow: the client is, the server isn't (it's all in aws lambdas)

[17:13] <lizmat> japhb: but you wouldn't want to search in .scss or .sass ?

[17:16] <japhb> The other extensions are pre-expansion, for people using CSS-derived "terse" stylesheet languages.  So they would be considered "source" for people who are using them.

[17:16] <avuserow> AWS egress can get pricey. Though I guess that's a good problem to have because it means we're popular :)

[17:17] <japhb> (But check those extensions before you set them in stone; there are far too many file extensions for me to keep them all straight in my head, and I don't feel super confident about those.  One of the frontend folks can probably rattle them off easily though.)

[17:17] <Nemokosch> fwiw, I'd like to see something that only compares text files (regardless extension), like grep by default

[17:17] <avuserow> I'll migrate my modules this weekend, thanks everyone for the continued ecosystem improvements. it's a lot better than the old github ecosystem repo :)

[17:18] <tonyo> avuserow: i'm feeling it, right now the costs are still low enough but i'm linode offers something similar soon

[17:19] <avuserow> tonyo, do you need help with this, either in ideas, money, or code?

[17:19] <avuserow> need or want :)

[17:21] <tonyo> not at the moment but i'll put your name in my hat for when that time comes, i do anticipate needing some code help in the future.  money never hurts, the whole eco is run on about $20 a mo.  a couple of people here (who i'm unsure want to be named) do support in that way

[17:22] <tonyo> ope, $40, not $20

[17:25] <avuserow> If it's easy for you to accept github sponsorships, I would add yours

[17:25] <avuserow> but yes, ping me if you think of anything. I may not have bandwidth due to other things but I'll see what I can do
