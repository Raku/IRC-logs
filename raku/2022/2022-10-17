[16:41] <tellable6> 2022-10-14T15:38:09Z #raku <[Coke]> melezhik - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4685 - shouldn't this be a Curlie bug, not a rakudo bug?

[16:42] <melezhik> .tell [Coke] I am not sure if this a curlie bug, when I was creating the one, I thought this is Rakudo's one, at least someone told me that this could be a true ))

[16:42] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[16:43] <melezhik> hi all, I have started to work on complete new CICD system based on Sparrow - SparrowCI, this is completely new design and I hope will be more easier for end users, I have dropped few examples in twitter (melezhik2) - let me know if someone is interested in using this ... thanks

[16:44] *** melezhik left
[16:48] *** jetchisel joined
[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> melezhik: gotta be honest... my personal problem is that I can't keep up with you. As a total analphabet to devops, I don't know how Sparrow, SparkyCI, SparrowCI, Tomtit and all that jazz relate to each other and which one I should take a closer look at in a couple of months

[17:04] *** melezhik joined
[17:08] <tbrowder> hi, has anyone tried to use unicode fonts with PostScript? if so i would appreciate a link to more info.

[17:08] <melezhik> Nemokosch - no worries , what I am trying to say that SparrowCI is going to replace some old systems I wrote before, but it still bases on old software I wrote before - I know it could be confusing, but more or less I think I am going to continue with this - https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI

[17:12] *** melezhik left
[17:14] *** quotable6 joined
[17:16] *** sena_kun left
[17:17] *** bloatable6 joined
[17:23] *** melezhik joined
[17:25] <melezhik> replacement probably is not accurate term, SparrowCI I guess will be main API for end user. Tomtit and Cromit will stay, but they have slightly different use case, and I think focus will be more on SparrowCI now.

[17:25] *** melezhik left
[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what made you reconsider the approach?

[17:31] *** Abhoerschutz left
[17:32] *** Abhoerschutz joined
[17:33] *** melezhik joined
[17:33] <melezhik> good question.

[17:35] <melezhik> long story short. I guess Sparrow/Tomtit idea is ok, but it mean and end user should create a lot of files to run a simple code - I mean one need to create task directory / task file and finally high level Raku file to run all this as a task function - for example. here

[17:35] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6/blob/master/documentation/development.md#task-folders-structure

[17:37] <melezhik> all this means a quite high barrier , especially for people who want all in single file  approach (when normally is true for the most of frameworks )

[17:37] <melezhik> even though such a split on many files gives some benefits for a framework author - but not for a framework user ))

[17:39] <melezhik> so, I am doing a sort transpiler now, which SparrowCI is, which makes it's possible to have all SparrowIsh code to be presented in a single YAML file, the approach models devops folks like with declarative DSL and bla-bla-bla

[17:40] <melezhik> compare previous code example with this one now - https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI/blob/main/files/examples/bash/task.yaml

[17:41] *** jetchisel left
[17:41] <melezhik> this clever bit is that this example would be transpiled into underlying Sparrow structure ( with many firs and files ) and and be executed as a standard Sparrow task, so I almost don't need to code anything )))

[17:45] <melezhik> so I am killing 2 birds in one stone here - provide an end user with a neat/simpler interface/API and still using already tested and well structured Sparrow design / code underneath

[17:46] <melezhik> also I have thought on expansion this SparrowCI API to other languages and communities, because for end user this is just a YAML based DSL allows to runs tasks written on different languages and exchange tasks states with tasks input/output data ...

[17:47] <melezhik> https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI/tree/main/files/examples

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and both birds are sparrows, haha

[17:48] <melezhik> that's right ))) it always about that HA-HA

[17:49] <melezhik> hopefully it adds some clarity now ...

[17:49] *** sena_kun joined
[17:52] *** jetchisel joined
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think so

[17:56] <melezhik> thanks

[17:59] <melezhik> btw besides input/output data tasks might exchange artifacts (binary files) with each other https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI/blob/main/files/examples/ruby/artifacts.yaml

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is this site https://perl6book.com

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it came up today as well, because I think it should be updated/moved some way
