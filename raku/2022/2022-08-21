[04:30] <tellable6> 2022-08-18T16:33:38Z #raku <tonyo> xliff fwiw i have a working slang to parse the datalog query stuff for an ORM, i've been waiting for rakuast to get there so i don't need to rewrite the code generation from it

[04:30] <Xliff> \o even...

[04:30] <Xliff> Why won't this work? https://replit.com/@Xliff/MaybeProtectedTrait#main.raku

[04:30] <Xliff> Is it because I am trying to pass a type object (which is undefined) instead of a defined value?

[04:31] <Xliff> Is there any way to pass a type object via trait?

[04:31] <Xliff> .tell tonyo Nice! I'd love to see it when you're done! If you need someone to test, please let me know.

[04:31] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to tonyo

[06:41] <XliffyMac> .tell lizmat If I wanted to create a .drop method that worked from the opposite end as .skip, would .reverse.skip($n).reverse be sufficient, or would it be better (read faster) to write it in nqp?

[06:42] <XliffyMac> .tell lizmat In other words, would something like "my $iter : self.reverse.iterator; Seq.new( $iter.skip-at-least($n).reverse ...)" be a way to implement it in nqp?

[07:27] <XliffyMac> lizmat: I'm trying to avoid the *-x syntax

[07:27] <XliffyMac> But thanks for example!

[07:27] <XliffyMac> For reference, your example would be equivalent to my proposed .drop(3)

[07:28] <XliffyMac> Er... .drop(4)

[07:29] <XliffyMac> sub drop ($a, $n) { $a.reverse.skip($n).reverse }; (1..10).&drop(4).say

[07:29] <XliffyMac> I'm wondering if that would be worth converting to nqp and submitting a PR for consideration.

[07:31] <XliffyMac> sub drop ($a, $n) { $a.head(*-$n) }; (1..10).&drop(4).say

[07:31] <evalable6> XliffyMac, rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3 4 5 6)␤»

[07:31] <XliffyMac> I should bench those.
