[00:54] <gfldex> Is there a way to tell an infix to take a WhateverCode as an argument instead of forming a closure?

[07:58] <immediate> hello! I have a string of length 4, I need to make it 7 by repeating things. Context: 3 digit CSS color code, e.g., `#FAB` to become `#FFAABB`. I do this

[07:59] <immediate> m: my $s = "#FAB"; say "#" ~ $s.comb.skip.map(* x 2).join

[07:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 65507b89d: OUTPUT: «#FFAABB␤»

[07:59] <immediate> Question is how you would do it? Some regex could be?

[07:59] *** laidback_01 left
[07:59] <immediate> or is it fine enough? (im relateively new to language)

[08:01] <immediate> oh there is raku-beginner i should have posted there I guess...

[08:02] *** laidback_01 joined
[08:09] *** laidback_01 left
[08:27] <CIAvash> m: say '#FAB'.subst: :g, /\w/, * x 2 # regex version

[08:46] <CIAvash> m: say '#FAB'.comb.rotor(1, 3).&{.[0] ~ .[1]».&(* x 2).join} # Another way to write your solution

[08:48] *** frost joined
[08:50] <immediate> thanks

[08:51] *** statisfiable6 joined
[08:52] <CIAvash> m: say '#FAB'.wordcase: :filter{.comb».&(* x 2).join} # and another solution

[15:22] <[Coke]> bisectable doesn't work on windows, right?

[15:22] <[Coke]> is it something I could run on my laptop and use directly rather than via IRC?

[15:30] <MasterDuke> yeah

[15:35] <MasterDuke> checkout how Blin does it

[15:37] <ugexe> i think those might relying on some non-windows commands

[15:37] <[Coke]> I just figure if I have to do another bisect on this windows laptop, I'm going to want it to be a managed thing, not me doing the bisect and rebuild by hand (throwing out the deploy each time.) 

[15:37] <[Coke]> I can fix that part.

[15:38] <[Coke]> I mean, theoretically

[15:41] <ugexe> on windows i usually bisect by release

[15:41] <ugexe> just switching between them with rakubrew

[15:41] <ugexe> so yeah not the most automated process

[15:42] <ugexe> you can also build specific commits ala `rakubrew build moar 234jfj39`

[15:42] <ugexe> for once you find the release it started

[15:52] <[Coke]> I used git bisect in a rakudo build, and did rm -rf /c/raku /c/sandbox/rakudo/nqp before each build, and it's gone ok

[15:52] <[Coke]> but either way there's management going on I'd rather script

[16:04] <[Coke]> crap. typed "git bisect good' on the last one... and it's hanging. like 5m now

[16:05] <[Coke]> ah, windows highlight paused output. oops

[16:07] *** Xliff joined
[16:08] <[Coke]> one of two skipped commits, an NQP bump or https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/dab9cd661588a9c9439f578c061e74fd658300cd

[16:09] <[Coke]> will try master with the latter reverted and see if that works.

[16:10] <Xliff> CAn you untap a supply or force a tapped handler to stop responding to events?

[16:13] *** abraxxa left
[16:13] <[Coke]> does bisectable deal with nqp bumps and dig into nqp commits, or just report that out as a single rakudo commit?

[16:14] <MasterDuke> single rakudo commit. that's been a longstanding todo (same with moarvm commits)

[16:15] *** abraxxa-home joined
[16:21] *** rypervenche left
[16:34] <[Coke]> crap. ok, still doesn't work with the one commit reverted.

[16:34] <[Coke]> which leaves the skipped NQP bump.

[16:37] *** laidback_01 left
[16:38] <[Coke]> ... which includes a moarvm bump. :P

[16:40] <[Coke]> ah. it ONLY includes a moarvm bump.

[16:43] <[Coke]> with 15 commits.

[16:45] <[Coke]> so it looks like shareable is handing out builds to use, those builds are all a specific kind of build, so would step one to add windows be to add any second arch type to shareable?

[16:45] <[Coke]> (and then at some point, a windows variant can be one?)

[16:56] <Xliff> Can you untap a supply or force a tapped handler to stop responding to events?

[17:06] <japhb> Xliff: I think there's some implicit context in what you are asking.  Are you talking about a live or on-demand supply?  Are you expecting to undo a single tap without disturbing other taps?  Do you have control of the code in the tap handler?

[17:07] <Xliff> japhb: I'm not sure about supply type. I want to untap just a single event and yes, I would have control of the code in the handler.

[17:07] <Xliff> I suspect the Supply being tapped would come from a source Supplier, since i would need .emit

[17:19] <japhb> I think I would tend to have an atomic flag visible to the tapping react that indicates mode (whether to ignore or not), and just drop events that arrive when ignoring.

[20:38] <El_Che> opera just over-raku'd raku: https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/14/22932918/opera-browser-emoji-only-web-addresses-urls-yat

[20:39] <[Coke]> with "NFT" in the article, it has lost all meaning.

[20:40] <El_Che> very true

[20:56] <guifa> So basically, we're at AOL keyword $foo all over again

[20:56] <El_Che> yes, but with blockchain

[20:59] <guifa> Are we gonna get a fezcoin so we can have NFT blockchain yadda yadda namesquatting for modules?

[20:59] * guifa . o O ( yadda is a real Raku thing after all )

[21:00] <El_Che> I read somewhere yadda yadda came fron  Lenny Bruce 

[21:03] <tonyo> i have 100% of the fezcoins

[21:04] <El_Che> rakudo-pkg, now with free fezcoins included

[21:06] <[Coke]> rakuoin

[21:08] <El_Che> rakuonion if you're a troll like me :)

[21:09] <[Coke]> the most suspicious commits in the moarvm range for me are adding some JIT items. ... oh, I can run my tests without the JIT. Grumble.

[21:11] <[Coke]> (retrying with a fresh master.)

[21:11] <[Coke]> (should have thought to do that step 1!)
