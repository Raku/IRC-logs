[12:37] <tellable6> 2021-10-26T15:04:00Z #raku <dakkar> RaycatWhoDat: subset Command of Str where * ~~ /:i ^ EXIT $ /; loop { my $command = prompt(">>") // last; last if $command ~~ Command; say "I will do <$command>" }

[12:37] <RaycatWhoDat> wha

[12:37] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh, I know what this is for

[12:37] <RaycatWhoDat> Thanks, dakkar

[12:37] <dakkar> wow, apparently a few months ago I replied to a question of yours

[12:38] <RaycatWhoDat> Yeah, this is probably for the orchestration thing I was fiddling with

[12:38] <RaycatWhoDat> I was using Raku as "Nicer Bash"

[12:39] <RaycatWhoDat> I'm currently running into the "This Seq has already been consumed" issue and I'm trying to grok how to actually solve it

[12:39] <RaycatWhoDat> I've done what the error asks me to do but it doesn't seem to work

[12:39] <RaycatWhoDat> Here's the non-functioning code: https://github.com/RayMPerry/kitchen-sink/blob/master/raku/encrypt-decrypt.raku

[12:40] <RaycatWhoDat> Why doesn't adding the `.cache` method to the usages of `@translations` actually work? Am I misunderstanding something?

[12:40] <grondilu> I encountered this error lately too.  I solved it by using .eager

[12:41] <RaycatWhoDat> `.eager` on the declaration?

[12:41] <RaycatWhoDat> err, assignment

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is that arrow thingy?

[12:41] <grondilu> instead of `my $ = (^10).something` I wrote `my $ = (^10).something.eager^

[12:42] <RaycatWhoDat> Nemokosch, it makes a Pair

[12:42] <grondilu> or something like that, the details don't matter

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oh right, I got confused

[12:43] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my $ = (^10).base(16)

[12:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «No such method 'base' for invocant of type 'Range'.  Did you mean any␤of these: 'Bag', 'Hash', 'are', 'asec', 'hash', 'race', 'take'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:43] <grondilu> oops

[12:43] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my $ = (^10).Str.flip

[12:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[12:43] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my $ = (^10).map(*.Str.flip)

[12:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(Seq)␤»

[12:43] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my $ = (^10).map(*.Str.flip).eager

[12:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(List)␤»

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, I don't remember needing eager in situations like that

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think it would be more idiomatic to just convert to List

[12:44] <RaycatWhoDat> Doesn't that have the same problem?

[12:44] <grondilu> I think I had tried that

[12:44] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my $ = (^10).map(*.Str.flip).list

[12:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(List)␤»

[12:45] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my @list = (^10).map(*.Str.flip); say @list[0]; say @list[0]

[12:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(Array)␤0␤0␤»

[12:46] <grondilu> meh I can't even reproduce the "Seq already consumed" error.  This thing is confusing.

[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Apparently it doesn't 🤔

[12:47] <RaycatWhoDat> grondilu, I think you need to try and iterate over the same sequence twice

[12:47] <grondilu> m: say .WHAT given my @list = (^10).map(*.Str.flip); for ^2 { .say for @list }

[12:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(Array)␤0␤1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤6␤7␤8␤9␤0␤1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤6␤7␤8␤9␤»

[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I only know that I regularly make these manipulations and never even heard of this eager thing. I know cache and this plain old List conversion

[12:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Hm.

[12:48] <RaycatWhoDat> Maybe some operations don't consume the Seq?

[12:48] <grondilu> my example was initially with a constant, not sure that changes anything.

[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not quite

[12:49] <RaycatWhoDat> In that case, Nemokosch, how would you fix the code I linked above?

[12:49] <grondilu> m: constant words = (1..100).fmt("foo%02x").words; say words[0] xx 2;

[12:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(foo01 foo01)␤»

[12:49] <RaycatWhoDat> There's nothing sensitive in it; feel free to copy-paste

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the @ sigil converts to positional

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> by default an Array iirc

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so if you assign to @list, an Array will be constructed from the Seq

[12:51] * grondilu still can't reproduce it.  oh well

[12:51] <RaycatWhoDat> Thanks for trying, grondilu

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> by adding .List after .comb

[12:53] <RaycatWhoDat> ohhhhhhh

[12:54] <RaycatWhoDat> Was it the `$key.comb` that was being consumed?

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> did you expect something else? 😄

[12:54] <RaycatWhoDat> `@translations`

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I thought we were talking about it all along

[12:55] <RaycatWhoDat> TIL

[12:55] <RaycatWhoDat> For some reason, I thought `.comb` was eager and just left you with a new Seq each time

[12:56] <RaycatWhoDat> Never thought it was using the same iterator

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oh no, as I said, @translations can't be consumed

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's an array by default

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> related thing that I don't really like: the separate concept of list assignment

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so you thought it was _lazy_, right?

[12:56] <RaycatWhoDat> Other way around

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> no, it was evaluated at the assignment and that's it

[12:57] <RaycatWhoDat> Also, I didn't grok the implication of "oh no, as I said, @translations can't be consumed"

[12:58] <RaycatWhoDat> IIRC, you only said "the @ sigil converts to positional"

[12:58] <RaycatWhoDat> and I didn't pick up the implications from that whole thing

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> $key.comb is a function call

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> no call happens later on, you have that one Seq

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does that mean?

[12:59] * RaycatWhoDat is waiting for discord-raku-bot

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what further implications do you need?

[13:01] <RaycatWhoDat> No, no, I was saying that I misunderstood the implication that "@translations can't be consumed" when you mentioned that "the @ sigil converts to positional by default an Array iirc". Hence, my overall confusion but now I know.

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-sigil_@

[13:03] <RaycatWhoDat> Lol.

[13:03] <RaycatWhoDat> Thank you for answering, though. I appreciate it.

[13:07] <grondilu> thinking_

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> do you have some shorthand for "ACTION" or do you just type it every single time? 😄

[13:39] <patrickb> I want to transfer a module (perl6-WebService-Github) to the Raku org since it's switched maintainers twice already. I guess it makes sense to rename it as well. Is there any consensus of whether there should be a "raku-" prefix in module repo names?

[13:39] <lizmat> perhaps it should be moved to raku-community-modules ?

[13:40] <patrickb> Is there any thing else to do except renaming the repo and transfering ownership (both via the web interface)?

[13:40] <patrickb> oh

[13:40] <patrickb> right

[13:40] <lizmat> update the ecosystem ?

[13:41] <patrickb> that's obviously the right place (in contrast to the Raku org)

[13:41] <patrickb> Yes, I also want to do a release.

[13:41] <lizmat> you have a fez login ?

[13:42] <patrickb> Modules in raku-community-modules are still uploaded as the author that does the release (me in this case), right?

[13:42] <patrickb> Yes I do. Already did some releases.

[13:43] <lizmat> ok, lemme send you an invite so you can release raku-community-modules to zef

[13:43] <lizmat> what's your fez login ?

[13:44] <lizmat> patrickb ?

[13:45] <patrickb> yes

[13:45] <lizmat> invite sent

[13:52] <kiti_nomad[m]> Does raku not support generics?

[13:54] <lizmat> it does:

[13:54] <lizmat> m: role A[::T] { method foo(T:D) { dd } }; A[Int].foo(42)

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «method foo(A[Int]: Int:D, *%_)␤»

[13:54] <lizmat> m: role A[::T] { method foo(T:D) { dd } }; A[Str].foo(42)

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected Str but got Int (42)␤  in method foo at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:56] <patrickb> Is there any preference wrt repo name prefix "raku-" vs no prefix at all?

[13:56] <kiti_nomad[m]> Did not find enough relevant information, it is best to have covariant and inverse content

[13:57] <patrickb> Most in raku-community-modules don't have a prefix. I think I'll just go for "WebService::GitHub" then.

[20:01] <japhb> grondilu: Assigning to an unsigiled constant means that you just want to directly store the Seq object itself in the constant, not the values that Seq would produce.

[20:46] <Tirifto> Is there some straightforward way I could get a custom handle that I could both write to and read from? Basically a drop-in replacement for a handle like $*IN, except instead of getting its data from a file or STDIN, it could get them from a list or some other object in the program itself?

[20:48] <Tirifto> (If I’m getting this right, a handle does not have resources of its own, but is meant to provide access to the resources of something else; a file or a ‘stream’ by the docs. So I’m wondering if it can provide access to data I already have in the program.)

[20:51] <Tirifto> (Also, I haven’t used them much, but it feels like Supply would normally fulfill this role in Raku? Except that supplies have a different interface, and I’m wondering if I could get something that can be talked to exactly like a handle.)

[21:02] <tonyo> Tirifto: not sure exactly what you mean by similar to a handle but https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/Event::Emitter might be relevant

[21:10] <Tirifto> tonyo, thank you; probably doesn’t fit this task, but I’ll have to look into it later!

[21:11] <Tirifto> I guess that by ‘similar to a handle’ I meant I could ‘put’ stuff there and ‘get’ stuff out. Though now when I think about it, I guess any custom class implementing these methods would do? It doesn’t feel robust, but I suppose it should work if that’s all I do with them. `o`

[21:11] <gfldex> Tirifto: Mocking IO is often used in Tests. So, you might fine inspiration in a module meant for testing.

[21:21] <Tirifto> Well… this worked, so… yay for polymorphism! # class ToDo is Array { method get { self.shift } }

[21:23] <Tirifto> gfldex, I’ll look into that, too; thank you!
