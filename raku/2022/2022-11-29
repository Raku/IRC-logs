[01:41] <tonyo> good news

[01:42] <tonyo> need to figure out how git applies that gitignore, it seems like the glob is applied in each folder so `*.DS_Store` matches in subdirs as well but i think the way i have it in fez matches what git does

[02:08] <guifa> https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore it's fairly complicated. if you can't get something figured out this week, I can try to come up with something for you next week

[12:27] <ToddAndMargo> I think what I may be doing wrong is not defining LPDWORD and LPSTR correctly:

[12:27] <ToddAndMargo> constant BYTE     := uint8;

[12:27] <ToddAndMargo> constant LPDWORD  := uint64;        # long pointer to a DWORD

[12:27] <ToddAndMargo> constant LPSTR    = CArray[BYTE];   # long pointer to a string

[12:31] <ToddAndMargo> I am giving it data structures instead of pointers

[12:47] <ToddAndMargo> Figured it out.  I forgot teh "rw" in

[12:47] <ToddAndMargo>    LPSTR   $lpBuffer is rw,

[12:47] <ToddAndMargo>    LPDWORD $nSize is rw

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> please publish as much of this kind of code as possible, without violating your business interests at least

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because this is very niche stuff within Raku folks from what I know

[14:27] <SmokeMachine> Hi lizmat. Sorry for keep asking you questions about rak, but I really like that tool and how would be a better person to ask about that than you?

[14:29] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I'm trying to list all aws_instances on a group of terraform files. My last try was this one: `rak '/resource <.ws> \"aws_instance\" <.ws> \"<( .* )>\"/' --extensions=tf --/show-filename --file-separator-null --trim`

[14:31] <SmokeMachine> but it adds an empty line between each line, shows the line number and shows the whole line instead on only the <( )> part (but only highlights that part). Would that be possible?

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, there is a raku-rak IRC channel 😛

[14:37] <SmokeMachine> :+1

[14:37] <SmokeMachine> 👍

[14:38] <SmokeMachine> I don't know it that's related to the version, but I've updated rak and now I found the option `--matches-only`that made it 1 step closer to what I want...

[14:40] <SmokeMachine> ok --/show-item-number (I was searching for something related to line...). Now only removing the empty lines is missing...

[16:26] *** Kaiepi joined
[16:27] <[Coke]> I wonder if next year we might want a way to surface people who have already been nominated so that people can say "oh, yes, Elsie did do a lot and I should vote for her."

[16:27] *** xinming joined
[16:29] <[Coke]> I assume non-core means "doesn't commit to the big 3 repos and is not on the RSC"?

[17:03] <[Coke]> coke is almost core

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> [Coke]: agreed, it's good for voting, and frankly, it would be also good to not re-nominate the same people over and over. Frankly, I wouldn't want to nominate somebody for an nth time, either. Administrative-ish stuff is too frustrating to do for no actual use...

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does this actually do?

[17:17] <[Coke]> doing a simplistic hamming distance.

[17:18] <[Coke]> how many changes are there (substutions only) between those two words. (coke vs. croke is probably technically a distance of 1 (1 insertion) but this would report that as 4, probably.

[17:21] <El_Che> I think the rainbow butterfly is a trick to make people questioning themselves if they are core or not :P

[17:21] <[Coke]> ^^ you can just sum up booleans. 

[17:22] <[Coke]> El_Che: Thankfully I was never going to nominate myself so I didn't have to answer that question. :)

[17:22] <[Coke]> I did nominate someone, hopefully within the latest window

[17:23] <Nemokosch> not sure it's a good idea to further obfuscate the code with boolean summing

[17:27] <[Coke]> I disagree that that's the obfuscating part there. :)

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well I think it is but it's rather tautological.

[19:25] <tbrowder> with tonyo's article on apache/cro websites in hand, surely someone is willing to self-host a decent, Rakupod/Markdown Raku Advent blogging site. i know it will take a bit of time, but, for a once-a-year event, it shouldn't take that much time compared to wasted hours on WP. and i'm willing to donate to the Raku Foundation to get it started.

[22:40] <tonyo> but i have no software for blogging so there'd probably need to be some consensus for what to use

[22:41] <coleman> static site generator?

[22:44] <tonyo> if you use that then you could just make an org for the advent in github and use that
