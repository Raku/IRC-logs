[00:37] <jaguart> Will add a test for Metamodel which IHMO is kind of core - and now I can recursively introspect non-core parent classes up the inheritance chain

[03:17] <lucs> My biggest wish for Raku docs: cross-refs.
[03:18] <lucs> Looking at the doc for 'elems', it would be really nice to have a "See also 'end'."
[03:18] <lucs> There are tons of places where things like that would be useful.
[03:40] <jaguart> grrr - it's naff that pod-declarators don't seem to work for our-scoped vars inside a class.

[10:56] <leont> I have a bit of a complicated setup (Proc::Async.output.lines ‚Üí supply { whenever ... } -> multiple $suppy.tap()s. Must I ensure everything is connected before calling .start or not?

[11:32] <leont> It's the kind of behavior that really needs to be documented well, it's subtle but it makes the difference between correct behavior or not
[11:33] <guifa> what was the code to enable RauAST on main right now?
[11:33] <lizmat> use experimental :rakuast
[11:33] <guifa> tyhuh
[11:33] <guifa> not working for me
[11:34] <guifa> do we still need the environment variable?
[11:36] *** abraxxa-home left
[11:43] * guifa is trying to test his advent day code before posting
[11:50] <lizmat> guifa: the environment variable is needed only if you want your code to be compiled using the new Raku grammar
[11:50] <guifa> huh
[11:50] <lizmat> the "use experimental :rakuast" is for being able to use the RakuAST:: classes in your code, using the old Perl6 grammar
[11:51] <guifa> I just refreshed my git directory and rebuilt 
[11:51] <lizmat> there is no point at this time to use the environment variable for your code, other than if you're working on the Raku grammar
[11:52] <lizmat> as the Raku grammar will first need to be completely identical in behaviour to the Perl6 grammar
[11:52] <lizmat> and it isn't yet
[11:53] <leont> I suspect the answer is I'm fine because I'm chaining on-demand supplies and not live ones, but it's not entirely obvious
[12:00] *** reportable6 left
[12:01] <guifa> lizmat  i see the issue now
[12:01] <guifa> I didn't realize the rename from master -> main was a new branch
[12:02] *** reportable6 joined
[12:02] <guifa> git was just updating master which was about 19 days old
[12:02] <lizmat> I guess you didn't read my second advent blog  :-)
[12:03] <guifa> I just misunderstood it lol I thought it was just a rename (e.g. that git was actually internally using some uid to point ot it)
[12:20] <guifa> yikes, seems to be a bug applying arguments to a postfix method call
[12:22] <guifa> wait nope, forgot a .new
[12:33] <lizmat> yeah, that happens a lot
[12:33] <lizmat> I wonder if we could make things easier by having a CALL-ME on all of those classes, which would do a .new
[13:01] <guifa> or just give an error message ha
[13:01] <guifa> "RakuAST::Literal isn't callable, did you forget a .new?"

[17:17] <melezhik> hi lizmat so to create a chat on Libera what should I do? I did while ago and not sure if I remember all the process, should I have an account with Libera for that first ?
[17:19] <lizmat> if you want to reliably "own" the channel, you must be able to login, yes
[17:19] <lizmat> if you don't want to be bothered by that, I could set up the channel for you under the #raku umbrella
[17:19] <melezhik> yeah, it'd be really good, thanks
[17:20] <lizmat> how would you have it named?   #raku-  ???
[17:20] <melezhik> I am just thinking about the name , sparrow , raku-sparrow, raku-sparrowci, sparrowci - there are some options ... ))
[17:20] <lizmat> it can only be #raku- if it is to be under the #raku umbrella
[17:21] <melezhik> maybe just raku-sparrow ?
[17:21] <lizmat> ok, #raku-sparrow it is
[17:21] <melezhik> oh, it was fast )))
[17:21] <melezhik> thanks
[17:21] <melezhik> can we set a topic for this?
[17:22] <melezhik> something like https://ci.sparrowhub.io - SparrowCI - super fun and flexible CI system with many programming languages support
[17:23] <lizmat> yeah, let me set up logging first  :-)
[17:23] <melezhik> people already using sparrowci might be interested - cc SmokeMachine

[18:55] <melezhik> ok, thanks

[18:56] <lizmat> not very expensive either ?
[18:56] *** Guest4522 is now known as Sauvin
[18:57] <lizmat> looks like 9 US$ ?    worth every penny
[19:00] <NemokoschKiwi> it seems to me that eventually, the IRC technology itself has barriers that can really hold communication back
[19:00] <NemokoschKiwi> the content distribution itself is not very scalable
[19:01] <NemokoschKiwi> creating a channel for every possible topic is quite heavyweight, especially if we consider that most people won't ever join these channels
[19:02] <lizmat> it's all about signal / noise ratio
[19:02] <lizmat> if you're not interested in the subject of a particular channel, don't join it
[19:02] <lizmat> that means less noise for you
[19:03] <lizmat> also, now that all logs are searchable, having separate channels would allow for more targeted searching
[19:06] <NemokoschKiwi> I mean fair enough, it's better than nothing
[19:06] <NemokoschKiwi> The point is rather that IRC itself has limits that cannot be easily overcome, if at all
[19:08] <NemokoschKiwi> a user being online means nothing, it only means that they won't lose messages, mostly
[19:08] <NemokoschKiwi> also, it's hard to target users based on some shared trait without explicitly "cherry-picking" them
[19:11] <NemokoschKiwi> Of course I could make a case for Discord but somehow I cannot see a certain userbase move to Discord, for respectable (although not necessarily practical) reasons
[19:12] <NemokoschKiwi> But then I can't imagine that there isn't an interactive platform that is closer to Discord in user experience, without the lack of control and transparency for Discord
[19:14] <NemokoschKiwi> does this make sense?
