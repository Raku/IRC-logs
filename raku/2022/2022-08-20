[05:12] <tonyo> nemokosch, you asserted a not in set.any and a in set.none were ambiguous andonly not true in raku, you cannot accept that your assertion is untrue? not really my problem
[05:12] <tonyo> swap the `not in` and ` in ` but still the point.
[05:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I asserted "any" is an ambiguous concept, which I stand by and which I provided examples for.
[05:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I also asserted that "none" is a twisted, anglocentric way to phrase things, and is pretty much mandatory in Raku if you want negation for all
[05:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> all *items*, mind you, not the all quantor itself, but it seems to me that others got this part anyway

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> where can I check the implementation of nqp::base_I?
[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or any other nqp namespaced thing really
[17:11] <tonyo> in the nqp repo is where i'd look
[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so far so good but the Raku/nqp repository is rather sophisticated, too; it wouldn't just hit me where to look within

[18:12] <tellable6> MasterDuke, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch
[18:13] <MasterDuke> for the jvm and js backend, nqp op implementations are in the nqp repo, but for the moarvm backend, the implementation for about 99% of the ops is in the moarvm repo
[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Middle English non, none, from Old English nan "not one, not any, no person; not the least part," from ne "not" (see no) + an "one" (see one). Cognate with Old Saxon, Middle Low German nen, Old Norse neinn, Middle Dutch, Dutch neen, Old High German, German nein "no," and analogous to Latin non- (see non-). It is thus the negative of one, an, and a (1).

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> MasterDuke: well, I must be missing something because I can't see how this turns into nqp::base_I...

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Uh sorry for the super late response, but anything really, I’m just curious what the ecosystem needs
[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> I know I’ve asked this before, but is a MoarVM competitor desirable?
[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> I know I’ve asked this before, but is a MoarVM/rakudo competitor desirable?
[20:10] <nine> Desireable? Sure. Realistic? Not so much. And then there's the point of, if someone had that kind of time and motivation, they would just be spent much better on Rakudo than a competitor.
