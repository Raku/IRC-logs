[03:10] <guifa> .tell jmerelo I'll have my article converted and ready for posting within 24 hrs.  Sorry things have been a bit crazy.  In an absolute pinch, can grab them from https://gist.github.com/alabamenhu/7261845862162b13b4a2affb4d945f58 but will need some light editing

[03:10] <tellable6> guifa, I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hot take: Raku's sigils *could* be great if they were backed up by (nearly) equally useful semantics

[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there was no Google in APL times and no APL in Google times üòõ

[16:57] <grondilu> I have a module for which the dynamic variables might be useful.  Example :

[16:57] <tellable6> 2022-12-19T16:03:46Z #raku <melezhik> grondilu - I guess this is already fixed - https://ci.sparrowhub.io/report/2220 ?

[16:57] <grondilu> m: package foo { our sub bar { $*bar } }; my $*bar = "bar"; say foo::bar

[16:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 665375bab: OUTPUT: ¬´bar‚ê§¬ª

[16:58] <grondilu> that works fine, but what if I need that at compile time?

[16:58] <grondilu> m: package foo { our sub bar { $*bar } }; my $*bar = "bar"; BEGIN say foo::bar

[16:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 665375bab: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§An exception occurred while evaluating a BEGIN‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§Exception details:‚ê§  Dynamic variable $*bar not found‚ê§    in sub bar at <tmp> line 1‚ê§    in code  at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[16:58] <grondilu> here I get an error, which is understandable, but what about that :

[16:58] <grondilu> m: package foo { our sub bar { $*bar } }; BEGIAN my $*bar = "bar"; BEGIN say foo::bar

[16:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 665375bab: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§An exception occurred while evaluating a BEGIN‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§Exception details:‚ê§  Dynamic variable $*bar not found‚ê§    in sub bar at <tmp> line 1‚ê§    in code  at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[16:59] <grondilu> why do I get that same error here too?  $*bar was declared at compile time too, and before the call to foo::bar

[17:00] <grondilu> spoiler: it's for https://github.com/grondilu/finite-fields-raku

[17:03] <grondilu> I want to use it in https://github.com/grondilu/elliptic-curves-raku, and it works, but I have to set the $*modulus variable for each import.  I tried to set it just once at the beginning, but it fails because further down there is a constant defined with a constructor calling the finite fields module.

[17:04] <grondilu> thus the foo bar example above which replicates the problem, I think

[17:05] <grondilu> oh wait there was a typo above

[17:05] <grondilu> m: package foo { our sub bar { $*bar } }; BEGIN my $*bar = "bar"; BEGIN say foo::bar

[17:05] <grondilu> well, same

[17:06] <grondilu> (kind of weird that it didn't complain about BEGIAN)
