[07:41] <CIAvash> What is the solution to MAIN sub accepting both `Bool` and `Int` when you have `sub MAIN (Int :$number)`? because Bool is Int. So it will only accept `--number` and `--number=1`, not `--number 1`, I can make a lone `--number` not work with a subset, but I can't get `--number 1` to work.

[07:47] <moon-child> I don't think it's possible, happy to be proven wrong though

[08:05] <CIAvash> OK, found a solution! `subset Number of Str where .Int.so`

[08:06] <moon-child> what happens if you pass 0?

[08:10] <CIAvash> good question, 0 doesn't work but in this case I need positive numbers

[08:15] <CIAvash> can make it work with zero with `subset Number of Str where !.defined || ($_ ne "" && .Int)`

[14:41] <leont> CIAvash: use Getopt::Long?

[14:43] <CIAvash> leont: I was contributing a small feature to a module, so that was not an option(unless the author decides to do so for more things they are going to add)

[14:53] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/3edbbcf200e593f0f2e17f28f7c453b80d76752a/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod#L1251-L1253

[14:53] <ugexe> fwiw thats how i handled that once

[15:02] *** frost left
[15:06] <CIAvash> I like MAIN, but this one bothered me and another thing was `:@list` parameter which doesn't allow passing only one argument, it has to be more than one. In the latter case I used Getopt::Long. There may have been some other annoyances too.

[15:10] <ugexe> i thought :@list has worked with a single argument for awhile

[15:11] <ugexe> m: sub MAIN(:@list) { say @list.raku }; @*ARGS = "--list=42";

[15:25] <CIAvash> hmm,  good to know. from what I remember it didn't 4+ months ago, this is when I started using Getopt::Long, Oct 31, 2021: https://github.com/CIAvash/Sway-PreviewKeys/commit/1167b3cf2a581075e1fa860713fecf50bbfb961c

[19:09] <toddr> I'm a rare poster here but wanted to share that the Perl and Raku Conference in Houston is coming up June 21-25. If anyone here can share with a wider Raku community, that would be appreciated. https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tprc-houston-newsletter-2 There is also a link off the newsletter to join the mailing list if you prefer

[19:27] <moritz> I tweeted about it with @raku_news

[19:27] <toddr> thank you moritz !

[19:29] <[Coke]> How do registration numbers look so far, toddr ?

[19:30] <[Coke]> I know we had some users who were very excited about an in person conference.
