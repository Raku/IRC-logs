[06:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Monads are glorified decorator pattern, change my mind

[06:31] <lizmat> .oO( does Go have monads?  :-)

[06:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Ruby is like the Smalltalk of Python

[06:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Those who use it swear that it's the best programming language ever

[06:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> But they very apparently fail to convince most people about it

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> First, of all I agree with that statement. It is a little oversimplifying, but it is ‚Äúto the point‚Äù, especially for people with OOP background.

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> Now, trying to ‚Äúchange your mind‚Äù. For me the main benefit of using monads is that they make the code written with them to have algebraic properties. I use monadic designs as ‚Äúdeveloper-user interfaces‚Äù, not necessarily to implement or design functionalities. That said, my DSLs that generate programming code are heavily based on ‚Äúmonadic‚Äù properties observed in the computatio

[16:21] <Voldenet> MitarashiDango[m: icon for `concise` should be `small` imo

[16:24] <MitarashiDango[m> Voldenet: Good choice, I might reuse powerful for regexes and grammars.

[16:25] <Voldenet> + worth mentioning how the language can be type-checked during compilation

[16:26] <MitarashiDango[m> Maybe, but I'd likely have to take something else out to replace it, there's no more space üòÖ

[16:26] <Voldenet> I'm not sure about expressiveness, reality is that anything but OOP will be tough

[16:30] <Voldenet> it's a statement that's hard to evaluate and easy to invalidate

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > anything but OOP will be tough

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> wait what

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also I don't think anyone is interested in hunting down subjective-ish statements

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you have used Raku for more than 2 weeks, it's pretty easy to get a feeling for this proclaimed "expressiveness"

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and it has nothing to do with OOP that's for sure

[16:38] <Voldenet> it's all subjective

[16:38] <MitarashiDango[m> The statement is an extract from the intro in https://marketing.raku.org/id/1516098660/any

[16:39] *** sena_kun left
[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if there is anything not subjective, it's that it has nothing to do with OOP, lol

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also, whether you consider it a useful measure or not, the length of the code is a measure, moreover an objective measure

[16:41] <Voldenet> I see that I misunderstood this point

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and if I understand it right, these are like catch phrases for someone who has never heard of Raku, and would like to get to know it for example

[16:44] <Voldenet> 'you can use it for one-liners and full stack dev' describes not the expressiveness but adaptability to various styles

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> indeed but who was talking about that?

[16:44] <Voldenet> the pdf linked

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the message doesn't say that, though

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> rightfully, I think

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "Raku is a supremely flexible and mutable language, adaptable to your own style of programming."

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this absolutely makes sense and it's not about "from one-liners to full stack dev"

[16:46] <Voldenet> >is a supremely flexible language, adapting to your style of programming, whether that be quick oneliners for sysadmins, scripts to manage a database import, or the full stack of modules necessary to realise an entire website.

[16:47] <Voldenet> that's why I said I misunderstood that

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay, perhaps I cannot keep up with the topic

[16:48] <Voldenet> I totally agree with that point, just I'm not sure if I'd describe that as expressive

[16:49] <Voldenet> but maybe I'm wrong

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the "from oneliners to full stack" point?

[16:52] *** andm joined
[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if I were to guess, the idea was to somehow register that Raku offers a lot, syntax-wise and structure-wise

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which I do think is worth noting

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if there was no other reason, at least as a tribute to the insane amount of work put into the language
