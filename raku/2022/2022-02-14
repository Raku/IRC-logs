[19:01] <leont> Experiencing a weird issue where I can't use a class inside a module if it's called X::Client, but can access it when it's renamed to Y::Xlient

[19:01] <leont> Er, Y::Client

[19:02] <lizmat> m: dd X::Client

[19:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5f49ace1: OUTPUT: «Could not find symbol '&Client' in 'X'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5f49ace1: OUTPUT: «X::Client␤»

[19:05] <leont> Er, can't use a class defined inside the module from outside of the module

[19:13] *** unicodable6 joined
[19:14] <leont> I can reproduce it with a Foo.rakumod containing «module Foo { class Y::Client {} }», and then running «raku -I. -e 'use Foo; Foo::X::Client.new'»

[19:30] <leont> CIAvash: yea,, inside the module it works fine

[19:30] <leont> *h

[19:31] <leont> Oh wait, I think I see what you mean

[19:31] <leont> I guess this is because X:: already exists as a namespace

[19:32] <leont> But I still doubt this is what we want

[19:33] <bartolin_> leont: there is at least this old open issue that points out some oddities with using core namespaces: https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/5815 (I didn't try if all the reported still exist, but at least this still looks strange:

[19:33] <bartolin_> m: class Foo { role X {}; method z { Foo!z } }

[19:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5f49ace1: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Could not locate compile-time value for symbol Method::NotFound␤»

[19:34] <leont> bartolin_: yeah, that sounds like the same issue

[19:34] <leont> Putting it in a package X { class ... } instead seems to work around the issue, but it's still rather surprising

[22:49] <guifa> there are some weird things that can happen with using any namespace that exists

[22:50] <guifa> I got a bug report with DateTime::Timezones where my module conflicted with another one that exported `class DateTime::Parse`

[22:50] <guifa> when mine imported in `class DateTime [is DateTime]`, the DateTime::Parse disappeared

[22:53] <guifa> that doesn't happen with non-built ins though:

[22:53] <guifa> m: class Foo::Bar { method foo {'foobar'} }; class Foo { ; }; say Foo::Bar.foo

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5f49ace1: OUTPUT: «foobar␤»

[23:06] <MasterDuke> i just watched p6steve's fosdem talk. i think that's the first time i've ever seen a grammar with two action classes available, very cool
