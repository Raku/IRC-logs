[02:39] <Nick12> What have people tried to make rakudo startup/execution faster? I absolutely love the power of the language but it's a barrier for me to adopt this over perl due to performance. For example:

[02:39] <Nick12> raku -e 'print $_ for 1..1000000;' > /dev/null  1.66s user 0.03s system 104% cpu 1.617 total

[02:39] <Nick12> perl -e 'print $_ for 1..1000000;' > /dev/null  0.25s user 0.00s system 98% cpu 0.254 total

[02:39] <Nick12> Rakudo v2022.02 installed on macOS 12.2.1 with homebrew

[02:39] <Nick12> perl v5.34.0 on the same system, also installed with homebrew

[02:43] <japhb> Nick12: In that *particular* case you may be running up against Perl doing no output encoding, but Raku using UTF-8 encoding by default.

[02:44] <japhb> But rather than microbenchmarks, I'd say it's more valuable to look at the performance difference for whatever it is you're *actually* trying to do.

[02:45] <japhb> (Having written quite a few microbenchmarks, I can say that it is very easy to wildly change relative performance with minor changes.)

[02:46] <japhb> Oh, also it matters for MacOS if you're on an Intel or ARM processor -- the latter does not yet have JIT support in Rakudo.

[02:56] <Nick12> Sure. I agree a single test case isn't sufficient to prove it's slower. Most big applications I default to using something like c++ and opt for scripting when I'm just trying to get something specific done really quickly and typically is focused on processing text (perl one liners? ooh 8)  lol). I've perceived a slower response time using rakudo

[02:56] <Nick12> which is a bit frustrating, and I know that's vague. It probably takes playing around with it a bit more and perhaps not entirely switching from perl to raku if I'm looking for something really snappy. The potential of saving minutes writing a raku script might dwarf the milliseconds to seconds of extra time spent executing one haha.

[02:57] <Nick12> FWIW I have an intel processor

[03:34] <japhb> Yeah, generally perl will be faster for pure sed/awk-like tasks, as that is what it was optimized for.  Rakudo will be faster for heavy OO and many of the numeric bits that Perl doesn't support out of the box (big integers, rational numbers, and complex numbers, for example).  And as you note, rather often Raku has more general whipupitude and developer efficiency.

[03:36] <japhb> Also, very few interpreters beat perl on startup time.  It's wicked fast at that.  Rakudo does a lot more at startup than perl does, and it costs a few dozen milliseconds to do all of that.

[05:54] <grondilu> on https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Operator_precedence the table seems to list operator precedence levels alphabetically, not from actual precedence levels.

[05:57] <grondilu> a quick search points to https://raku.finanalyst.org/language/operators.html

[05:57] <grondilu> where the table makes much more sense.

[06:28] <grondilu> then it's the conversion to html that is wrong.

[10:31] <grondilu> isn't there a flag for `prompt` to suppress echo?

[10:32] <grondilu> I mean what is the correct way to prompt for a password then?

[10:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hmmm

[10:37] <gfldex> grondilu: see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/io_operators.pm6#L146

[10:40] <gfldex> echo is a property of the terminal and Raku doesn't know those exist

[10:41] <gfldex> https://raku.land/github:titsuki/Terminal::Readsecret

[10:41] <gfldex> this module does

[10:42] <Voldenet> > sub without-echo(&fn) { LEAVE { run("stty", "echo") }; run("stty", "-echo"); fn() }; say without-echo({ prompt("password: ") })

[10:43] <grondilu> I guess I can also call the shell :

[10:43] <grondilu> say "password was {.out.slurp}" given shell q[read -s -p "password?"; echo $REPLY], :out

[10:43] <grondilu> lol that's fun

[10:45] <grondilu> I don't mind excluding Windows users lol

[10:45] <Voldenet> windows-also solution sounds difficult to maintain on your own

[10:45] <gfldex> It would make any coporate password policy very happy indeed.

[10:45] <Voldenet> regarding corporate password policies, I've seen things you people wouldn't believe :D

[10:46] <gfldex> I got a login for a software that controls SIM cards. 8 chars max for the PW.

[10:46] * grondilu thinks about the famous Sony playstation hack

[10:46] <gfldex> Dont't use SMS for two-factory.

[10:46] <gfldex> s/y//

[10:53] <Voldenet> sadly some services only have sms or nothing, sms is still better than nothing

[10:53] <grondilu> Voldenet: looking at your solution again, it looks fine actually

[10:54] <Voldenet> well, stty is relatively portable too

[10:56] <grondilu> quite a smart use of LEAVE too

[10:59] * grondilu ended up using that solution

[11:11] <grondilu> what about checking input by prompting password twice and dying if the inputs differ?  How to make sure echo is restored then?  Since the LEAVE will not be executed.

[11:14] <Voldenet> hmm?

[11:15] <grondilu> well it's common to ask for a password twice to check for input mistakes.

[11:15] <grondilu> then if there is indeed a mistake I would raise an exception, but then the LEAVE will not be executed, would it?

[11:17] <Voldenet> it would

[11:17] <grondilu> { CATCH { default { say "oops" }; LEAVE say "done"; die "aaaahh"; } }()

[11:19] <Voldenet> m: { CATCH { default { say "oops" } }; LEAVE say "done"; die "aaaahh"; }

[11:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «oops␤done␤»

[11:21] <grondilu> ok great

[11:21] <Voldenet> either way:

[11:21] <Voldenet> sub without-echo(&fn) { LEAVE { run("stty", "echo") }; run("stty", "-echo"); fn() }; sub get-new-pass { without-echo(sub { loop { my $pass = prompt("password: "); return $pass if $pass eq prompt("\nrepeat password: "); say "\npasswords mismatch" }  }) }; say get-new-pass;

[11:23] <grondilu> I don't need a dedicated `without-echo` function but yeah, that's the idea.

[11:24] <grondilu> m: { LEAVE run <echo bye>; say hi; }  # testing shorter syntax
