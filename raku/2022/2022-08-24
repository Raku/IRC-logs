[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I'm curious about this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5042
[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> seems like for windows, $*DISTRO doesn't report the version of the machine but the version of the tools it was built with. is this a bug?

[21:46] <duuude> could raku be used as an embedded scripting language like lua?
[21:48] <lizmat> You can embed Raku: this has e.g. been done in the Inline::Perl6 Perl module 
[21:56] <perryprog> I really wish there were other languages besides Lua that were popular for embedding.
[21:57] * lizmat knows you can embed, because I wrote the code to catch "exit"  :-)

[22:20] <melezhik> .
[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't use Raku as an embedded scripting language, it seems too heavyweight for that
[22:35] <tonyo> alternatively it's flexibility and grammar support would make it very useful and interesting for embedding, particularly because actions can be used in a way that directly translates to functionality
