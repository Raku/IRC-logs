[03:12] <Xliff> guifa_, week rollover issue?

[10:38] <lizmat> well, I guess you could add it to your packages...

[10:39] <El_Che> yes, that's another can of worms

[10:39] <El_Che> I was thinking more of a single file/tupperware container with rakudo and the app

[10:39] <lizmat> but still, please test it yourself please...  with 138 command line options, there are bound to be some combinations not doing the right thing

[11:47] <tbrowder> hi, is there any way to get num days in a year other than this:

[11:48] <tbrowder> m: say Date.new(2022, 12,31).day-of-year

[11:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4cdb55850: OUTPUT: «365␤»

[11:51] <lizmat> I'd say, barring a special Date method, is pretty much descriptive

[11:51] <tbrowder> ah, you rose to the bait! how about a new Date method?

[11:52] *** frost32 joined
[11:54] <tbrowder> should be fairly easy. i was going to file issue and take it on if no objections

[11:55] <tbrowder> but i don't want to get in a long convo with nay sayers

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Hmm, seems I only finished half a thought above... where I said *"voting will not display properly"* I  got to say *"unless you are logged in"*

[14:18] <Xliff> In the case of sub ( :$optional is rw ) {  ... } -- how can I tell if $optional contains a valid container?

[14:18] <Xliff> Or is there a way to make the logic moot?

[14:19] <Xliff> sub ( :$optional is rw = $) # for example?

[14:19] <Xliff> Ah. There is no way to make an optional parameter rw.

[14:20] <Xliff> Fahrvergnügen,

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Several users on the array languages discord (APL Farm) use the site (as it features APL and J as  languages). I've not seen any complaints about anything dodgy. I signed up to vote for Raku, so far so good, but I'd rather solve some of these challenges in Raku, which is not available, and getting Raku more exposure is generally a good thing

[22:16] <guifa_> tbrowder; that's an interesting question re days in the year

[22:17] <guifa_> in my mind it doesn't work for Date, because it's really an attribute of the year, rather than of the date

[22:18] <guifa_> although I guess we do have is-leap-year 

[22:19] <guifa_> but in retrospect I'd probably poo poo that lol

[22:19] <guifa_> Date.new(:2022year).is-leap-year ?? 366 !! 365

[22:24] <tonyo> the weirdness it gets into is when week-of-year can encompass the first few days of the year, so it might be that week 53 actually ends jan 3 (as it did in 2020) so should 2021-12-31 actually be the 365-3 day of the year or something else

[22:24] <tbrowder> guifa_: i see what you mean, theoretically, but then raku life could get real complicated in a hurry going down that route. i absolutely love the rake time and date types--so much easier than using Perl's time stud

[22:25] <tbrowder> *stuff

[22:27] <tbrowder> week-of-year can be interesting. see my Easter and other church year modules.

[22:33] <guifa_> week of year is like day of week, unfortunately.  We use an ISO definition (Which is sensible), but it is certainly slightly deceptive to people as different locales handle that differently
