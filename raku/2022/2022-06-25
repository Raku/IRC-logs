[05:18] <Neuron> Hello, where would I find Hash.raku() implementation?

[05:19] <Neuron> On sparc (bit endian machine) it says negative numbers (like (\Hash_-2538074464 = {a => 42, b => Hash_-2538074464}) which breaks spectest

[05:48] <Neuron> Voldenet, thank you!

[05:49] <Voldenet> though it's more convoluted

[06:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> For the SO questions: yes, common sense helps with the numbers; the number format itself much less so

[06:10] *** reportable6 joined
[06:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> For me, the comma indicates a decimal fraction so ironically enough, this number format is rather exclusive from my perspective

[06:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Add the rather bizarre "thousand K" instead of "one M" and bang, confusion arises

[10:51] <Xliff> Hi ho!

[10:51] <Xliff> What

[10:52] <Xliff> Can I dynamically add a parent to a given class via the HOW?

[10:53] <Xliff> m: class A { method a { 42.say}; }; class B { }; B.^add-parent(A); B.a.say;

[10:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7d8e9d0f: OUTPUT: «No such method 'add-parent' for invocant of type␤'Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:00] <Xliff> m: class A { method a { 42.say}; }; my $x = Metamodel::ClassHOW.new_type( name => 'MyCustomB' ); $x.^add_parent(A); $x.^compose; $x.new.a

[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7d8e9d0f: OUTPUT: «42␤MyCustomB␤»

[11:01] <Xliff> Well, that's progress. Would love it if you could do it to previously composed classes, or could take a composed class and make a new uncomposed type from it.

[11:01] <Xliff> At any rate... Happy Caturday.

[11:14] <Voldenet> you don't need Metamodel::ClassHOW

[11:14] <Voldenet> m: class A { method a { 42.say}; }; my $x = .HOW.new_type( name => "MyCustomB" ); $x.^add_parent(A); $x.^compose; $x.new.a; $x.^name.say

[11:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7d8e9d0f: OUTPUT: «42␤MyCustomB␤»

[11:15] <Voldenet> Any.HOW sounds pretty nice too
