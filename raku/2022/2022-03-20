[14:17] <uzl[m]> Hello folks, long time no see ;-)! I hope everyone is doing fine!!!

[14:17] <uzl[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/tils43/whats_rakus_intended_audience_and_use/

[14:17] <uzl[m]> Would it be possible to get a few answers for this question?

[14:18] <uzl[m]> Btw I tried to join the Raku discord server but it seems it's not maintained anymore. If it's the case, it should be removed from the Community tab: https://raku.org/community/

[14:20] <MasterDuke> there have been people using it pretty recently and gfldex maintains the irc bridge bot

[14:22] <uzl[m]> I get a "Message Failed to Load" and it stays there: https://discord.com/invite/VzYpdQ6

[14:48] <suman> while viewing moarvm profiler results, is it good or bad to have time spent on garbage collection?

[14:51] <MasterDuke> in one sense bad, since it's time spent not in your code. on the other hand, the whole point of GC is to not have to manage memory yourself

[14:53] *** sena_kun left
[14:54] *** sena_kun joined
[14:54] <suman> Ok

[14:55] <suman> And what about jit compiled frames and call frames. Does having more call frames means bad less efficent code?

[14:57] *** Sgeo joined
[15:04] <MasterDuke> in general the more call frames the longer something is going to take. but it also depends what those call frames are doing of course
