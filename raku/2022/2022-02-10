[01:47] <tonyo> .tell curiosa if you're writing a slang, the parsing state info should go into the grammar and the actions should handle the qast generation (if that relies upon the token state then keep track of that state separately or design your tokens around the design so that you can tell which flavor the match is

[08:35] <jaguart> In a Grammar - is it possible to use a changing quantifier that is captured within the regex? E.g. given: "s:3:abc;s:5:defgh" I want to do something like token str { 's:' $<num>=[\d+] ';' $<content> = [ . ** { $<num>} ] } so that $<content> is set to "abc" and "defgh" respectively?
[08:38] <jaguart> The $<content> captures can contain any chars - quotes, newlines etc. so I really want to extract by quantifier, and the char-count is considered reliable.
[08:47] <MasterDuke> m: say "a3bbbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/; say "a3bbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/; say "a3bbbbc" ~~ /a(\d)b**{$0}c/
[08:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar ee232c02b: OUTPUT: «｢a3bbbc｣␤ 0 => ｢3｣␤Nil␤Nil␤»
[08:48] <MasterDuke> jaguart: like that ^^^ ?

[09:06] <dsad> hey
[09:06] <dsad> can anyone help me?
[09:06] <dsad> I have school presentation of Raku
[09:06] <dsad> and i need some help
[09:09] <lizmat> the school presentation is about the programming language Raku ?
[09:10] *** dakkar joined
[09:11] <dsad> yes
[09:11] <dsad> lizmat
[09:11] <lizmat> Cool
[09:11] <lizmat> so what would you want / need ?
[09:13] <dsad> i would like to know about most important features of raku
[09:13] <dsad> for example
[09:13] <dsad> like if its open source
[09:13] <dsad> and anything like that
[09:14] <dsad> just basics
[09:15] <lizmat> If you don't know whether Raku is open source, then I suggest you do a little more home work, like visiting https://raku.org  and come back here if you have more questions :-)
[09:17] <dsad> im very bad at english
[09:17] <dsad> thats my only source
[09:17] <dsad> the original raku website
[09:17] <lizmat> what is your native language?
[09:18] <dsad> finnish
[09:18] <dsad> finsih
[09:18] <dsad> finish
[09:18] <lizmat> ah, hmmm... that's still missing from https://raku.guide  :-(
[09:20] <lizmat> perhaps the english version of raku.guide would be helpful for your school project?
[09:20] <dsad> All i know its similar to perl ruby smalltalk haskell javascript and its for scripting web dev and managing different texts
[09:21] <dsad> well i will look at it
[09:22] <dsad> how can i access to raku by my own hands?
[09:22] <dsad> visual studio?
[09:22] <lizmat> if you like IDE's, you should probably download the community version of https://commaide.com
[10:06] <dsad> hmm i dont get raku running on that
[10:06] <dsad> idk

[17:51] <lizmat> it will be in the REA in a few minutes
[17:51] <lizmat> actually, did you know that there are no CPAN mirrors anymore?
[17:51] <lizmat> there's just a single load-balanced / distributed URL nowadays, afaik
[17:52] <timo> OK, so less a loose network of mirrored servers with perhaps different update frequencies, more a CDN like thing 
[17:56] <lizmat> yup, a CDN

[17:59] <japhb> timo: What's new in the newest JSON::Fast?
[17:59] <lizmat> :immutable
[18:00] <lizmat> + the ability to specify defaults for to-json and from-json
[18:00] <lizmat> in the use statement
