[03:00] <azawawi> Any idea why my module Godot::Fun is not getting indexed in raku.land? https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/jobs/3094390134#L40

[08:07] <lizmat> Nemokosch: indeed, not intentional, new version uploaded to zef, thanks for the spot!

[08:07] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[08:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yey ü•≥

[08:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, I think it's time to admit what I was looking for üòÖ

[08:15] *** [Coke]___ joined
[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there a way to filter modules by release date - especially initial release date?

[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The ecosystem module is already a huge step forward from the original Citation Index workflow but I'm very tempted to do it retrospectively

[08:16] *** [Coke]_ left
[08:17] <lizmat> hmmm  getting a release date more generally, is going to be difficult, as the concept of a release on the p6c ecosystem is vague

[08:20] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: 2a8bad835e | (Ahmad M. Zawawi)++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | META.list

[08:20] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: Switch to main on Godot::Fun Coke++

[08:20] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/commit/2a8bad835e

[08:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lizmat: what about outside of the context of the ecosystem module. Can I, say, just take a git repo and traverse it commit by commit?

[08:22] <lizmat> Nemokosch: I guess you could get the release date from the latest date of the first tar file

[08:22] <tellable6> lizmat, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[08:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lizmat: I miss something conceptually. If there is a "first tar file", how come it can have multiple dates?

[08:45] <lizmat> sorry, the tar file of the first release of a distribution may have been created at any time: the original dates are on the file inside the tar file

[08:45] <lizmat> then take the highest date of the files in the tar file

[08:45] <lizmat> datetime/ epoch I mean

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay, gotcha

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you think it would be useful to build up some data structure that contains these dates for all modules?

[08:49] <lizmat> Yes.  but if at all possible, I would like to see that in the context of the REA

[08:49] <lizmat> e.g. by adapting the REA meta file by adding a release-date field

[08:50] <lizmat> I'm already working on being able to introspect the rea using rak

[08:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, that would make sense in REA rather than floating in the void...

[14:45] *** [Coke]_ joined
[14:47] <rir> @tonyo, Thanks, I don't think I'd have got there because it seems redundant to me.

[14:48] <tonyo> the IntStr should stringify correctly

[14:48] <tonyo> m: <01 02 03>.map(*.chars).raku.say;

[14:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: ¬´(2, 2, 2).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't have known there is such a noticeable difference between plain angular brackets and qw

[14:51] <rir> It does, but why have allomorphs when not needed.

[14:57] <tonyo> hmm, that has a problem when i do RAKUDOLIB='Custom#XXX, Custom#YYY'

[14:57] <tonyo> oops

[15:10] <rir> @tonyo Should I get that in my head as tone-e-o or tone-yo or ... ?

[15:15] <tonyo> heh, my name is tony so both work

[15:15] <tonyo> i also get ton-yo a lot

[17:36] <thowe_> Whoever wrote this: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parse_an_IP_Address#Raku  My hat is off to you.  I have had so much fun getting riled up over this.

[17:39] <lizmat> yeah, interesting use of dynamic variables  :-)

[17:40] <thowe_> I had never heard of such a thing.  Took me forever to figure out what <xdigit> was too.  I changed it to <:Hex_Digit> in my own example

[17:41] <thowe_> Ho hum, just throw a named Unicode type in my regex...  as you do...  mind blown

[17:42] <thowe_> Then I started looking at some of the other language examples...  They taste like prison food by comparison.

[17:43] <lizmat> :-)

[17:43] <lizmat> dynamic variables are indeed a powerful concept

[17:46] <lizmat> like $*OUT being the handle for STDOUT

[17:46] <lizmat> m: $OUT.say: "hello world"

[17:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Variable '$OUT' is not declared.  Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this‚ê§was intended to be part of a signature?‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> <BOL>‚èè$OUT.say: "hello world"‚ê§¬ª

[17:46] <lizmat> m: $*OUT.say: "hello world"

[17:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: ¬´hello world‚ê§¬ª

[17:46] <lizmat> but it is easy to override:

[17:46] <lizmat> m: class A { method print($) { note "fooled ya" } }; say "here"; { my $*OUT = A; say "hello world" }; say "back again"

[17:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 90709d533: OUTPUT: ¬´here‚ê§fooled ya‚ê§back again‚ê§¬ª

[17:47] <lizmat> a class only needs to provide a "print" method

[17:47] <tonyo> i have something very close to working that is similar (and a little less manual) than python's venv for raku, when is the weekly due?

[17:49] <lizmat> tonyo: usually on Monday  :-)
