[03:19] <[Coke]> so I can use zef to install -to a specific directory. now to figure out how to make raku only look in that directory and no where else

[03:21] *** Guest26 left
[03:24] <[Coke]> my best guess would have been to use RAKULIB to override the search path, but it doesn't seem to override.

[03:53] *** Guest26 joined
[03:59] <[Coke]> use case: trying to un-skip tests in the docs, but some of them may be passing because I happen to have a module installed that someone else might not.

[09:27] <nine_> [Coke]: CompUnit::Repository::Mask was intended for that use case. It may have bitrotted a bit though. But then it's a very simple module, so presumably easy to fix.

[14:10] <melezhik> I need to encrypt users passwords with some strong encrypted algorithm and salt in store them in database , any existing Raku solution one can recommend? Thanks

[14:10] *** alfonsox left
[14:10] <melezhik> I care more about encryption part , not storing in database

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I want to define a set for functions for a set of "external evaluators", like, Mathematica, Python, or R. What would be a good name for a package with them?

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I know how to make those evaluators using ZMQ. Initially, I thought of "tucking them in" in the package "Text::CodeProcessing", but I am not sure that is good place...

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Currently, I consider the name "Proc::ZMQed" with sub-namespaces like "Proc::ZMQed::Mathematica" and "Proc::ZMQed::Python" etc.

[18:16] *** euandreh joined
[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I also recommend something like Crypt::Argon2 for making an encryption key from a password, if you need to do something like that

[21:10] <ugexe> just the name or handle of whomever you wish to nominate. the award is for non-technical/core contributions

[21:10] <El_Che> ugexe: so you won't get one for zef? Mm

[21:12] <ugexe> i'm afraid that would be a bit of a stretch

[21:13] <El_Che> lizmat also deserved a cart full of butterflies

[21:13] <El_Che> (I almost wrote camels :P )

[21:14] <ugexe> it would go with their white camel

[21:14] <ugexe> (this is the raku version of the white camel award fwiw)

[21:17] <hythm> [Coke]: looks like `RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH` alters Raku's default repositories. running `RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH='inst#/my-custom-repo' raku -e 'say $*REPO.repo-chain' #OUTPUT: (inst#/my-custom-repo). but the documentation advises against setting `RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH` manually, so I'd ask nine or other experienced people in this area of code before using

[21:17] <hythm> it.

[21:29] <ugexe> yeah don't use RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH, its an implementation detail

[21:29] <ugexe> m: BEGIN %*ENV<RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH> = "foo"; BEGIN %*ENV<RAKULIB> = "bar"; say $*REPO.repo-chain

[21:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 59a348538: OUTPUT: ¬´(file#/home/camelia/foo)‚ê§¬ª

[21:34] <ugexe> the correct way of doing it would be using CompUnit::Repository::Mask as niner mentioned (i.e. using a custom CUR that itself will ignore the other repos)

[21:34] <ugexe> that being said, i've been wanting an ENV var to do this forever

[21:35] <ugexe> but i can see where it might get complicated, since the order of repos affects e.g. sha1 checksums used for precomp and thus might easily create situations where precompilation needs to reoccur without the user knowing it

[21:37] *** sgrs left
[21:38] <ugexe> i.e. it gets precompiled with one set of $*REPO.repo-chain, but then later when running it with a different $*REPO.repo-chain (such as when RAKUDO_PRECOMP_WITH is set) it would generate different sha1s and potentially need to reprecompile
