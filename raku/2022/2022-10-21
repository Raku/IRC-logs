[08:09] <Xliff> Hi. I'm getting a lot of seg faults with g4d43bbf95

[08:10] <Xliff> Also getting a lot of these:  [DOM::Tiny] No such method 'protect' for invocant of type 'NQPArray'

[08:10] <Xliff> This should trigger it: 'zef install DOM::Tiny'

[08:44] <lizmat> Xliff: but that's a revert? of basically the commit before that?

[08:44] <patrickb> nine: I'm a bit puzzled by failures in my OBS build setup. The builds now routinely fail with a compile error in the rakudo build. (But I did see them succeed.) My OBS setup is basically clone of yours.

[08:46] <patrickb> nine: If you can spare a minute, could you have a look if something rings a bell? https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:patrickbkr:raku-ci/rakudo-moarvm

[08:46] <lizmat> Xliff: DOM::Tiny installs for me without issue with g4d43bbf95

[08:47] <nine> patrickb: [   42s] ===/usr/bin/nqp-m version 2022.06 is outdated, 2022.07-9-gd397598a1 expected.

[10:17] <Xliff> lizmat: I'm puzzled myself. I am trying to find the root cause.

[10:18] <Xliff> I think I might need to nuke my rakudo dir.

[10:18] <Xliff> But I am in the middle of $dayJob, atm. Might be a while.

[10:18] <lizmat> ok

[10:18] <Xliff> How can I trigger case insensitive mode inside a regex?

[10:18] <Xliff> i:?

[10:19] <lizmat> :i rather

[10:19] <lizmat> m: say "FOO".match( / :i foo / )

[10:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: «｢FOO｣␤»

[10:20] <lizmat> m: say "FOO".match( rx:i/ foo / )

[10:20] <Xliff> Ah, thankee.

[10:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: «｢FOO｣␤»

[10:20] <lizmat> inside or outside  :-)

[10:20] <lizmat> think of it as an adverb

[10:24] *** haxxelotto joined
[10:36] *** massa joined
[10:38] <moritz> fun fact: there are adverbs that change how a regex is used (like :g/:global, :pos etc) and others that affect how a regex is compiled (:i, :ignoremark, :ratchet come to mind)

[10:39] <moritz> if you call a .match method with an existing regex, you cannot modify it with :i, you can only pass things like :global in

[12:12] <thundergnat> I had to find unique values from a large list of numeric and string values loaded from a file (as strings), with the constraints that numerics were unique by magnitude and strings case insensitive. Took a while fiddling with it, but Raku came through \o/.

[12:13] <thundergnat> m: say '2 7 5 -7 2 3 3 3 A9 a9 A4 b1 5 7 7 7.0 +7 0.7e1 -7 B1'.words.unique: :as({ .Numeric ?? (+$_).narrow !! .lc });

[12:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d43bbf95: OUTPUT: «(2 7 5 -7 3 A9 A4 b1)␤»

[12:14] <thundergnat> Fist time I ever used the :as parameter to unique in the real world.

[14:04] <Newbie21> I was able to get Raku to running using the Linux / MacOS instructions.

[14:05] <Newbie21> I still think the WSL instructions on https://rakudo.org/star/source look out of date wrt directory structure.  The step "cd nqp" fails (no such directory), but I was able to find another nqp directory.

[14:06] <Newbie21> The step "git checkout $(cat ../tools/build/MOAR_REVISION)" also failed, and I couldn't find a MOAR_REVISION file anywhere.

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> Bringing this over from raku-beginner: is it a bug or undocumented intentional behavior that `*{*}` does not parse the same as `{ $^a{$^b} }`

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> The Whatever-currying docs entry does not mention hash indexing as a special case

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if I were to propose an answer to my own(-ish) question: maybe it all boils down to what handles Whatever as a distinct case and what does not?

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> I think it does actually come down to what the signature is on the hash access operator, but I think if it’s behaving the way it’s meant to that ought to get a mention in the docs
