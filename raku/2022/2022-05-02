[00:19] <Voldenet> Bscan: cool vscode support, as an improvement consider using nqp::getcomp('Raku').compile for massive performance boost and some additional checks

[00:39] *** frost joined
[00:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> Thanks voldenet! I'll take a look at getcomp. Additional checks (or symbol information) would certainly be nice.  The Perl Navigator has Perl::Critic and inspects the symbol table for various features, so I'm certainly looking for additional sources of information for the Raku version.

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this also doesn't work as one can see by the input but I wouldn't have expected this to work anyway

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there is no hint that @_ would exist as a topic variable so no surprise that it is indeed not a topic variable

[09:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is the goal?

[09:05] <grondilu> to make list of integer from their hex representation

[09:06] <grondilu> integer*s*

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't think you can just pass a list instead of a number 🤔

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> tbh this feels just like passing a sequence of values instead of a value to any function

[09:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you have two numbers, why not just write them? (0xaa, 0xff)

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and if you have an indefinite number of values, resorting to some literal syntax isn't a good idea anyway

[09:53] <grondilu> often blobs on the web are displayed as a sequence of bytes in hex.  It would be convenient to be able to paste that and turn it into the relevant raku code easily.

[09:53] <grondilu> like for test vectors in crypto

[09:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well you can stick to the "verbose" solution, although at that point I'd rather use a whatever curry

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but then what do .Array and .List do that turns this scalar into a positional container, whatever the name is

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's even inconsistent at times: Z and X do pay attention to this "scalarness", hyper and even reduce don't

[16:59] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/05/02/2022-18-period/

[17:16] <CIAvash> I think that's happening because `map` is capturing everything. And those are items.

[17:16] <CIAvash> m: my (|c) := [[1,2],[3,4]]; dd c

[17:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «\($[1, 2], $[3, 4])␤»

[17:17] <CIAvash> so, if they are items, they need to be decontainerized:

[17:17] <gfldex> lizmat: I did not know that I can start the REPL like that. Are there any spec tests? :->

[17:17] <CIAvash> m: say [[1,2],[3,4]].map: *<> Z <1 2 3>

[17:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(((1 1) (2 2)) ((3 1) (4 2)))␤»

[17:17] <lizmat> gfldex: I don't think so...

[17:18] <lizmat> and it's going to be pretty tricky perhaps to write tests for that?

[17:18] <lizmat> hmmm... I guess it could be part of the normal repl tests....  hmmm

[17:18] <gfldex> :->   ← that's my "I'm-being-cheeky-face"

[17:22] <CIAvash> And that's happening because Arrays have containers. Lists don't

[17:22] <CIAvash> m: say ((1,2),(3,4)).map: * Z <1 2 3>

[17:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(((1 1) (2 2)) ((3 1) (4 2)))␤»

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Okay but then why does even *.Array fix the containerisation?

[17:36] <CIAvash> actually it's not related to map, it's just Arrays having containers

[17:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «$[1, 2]␤»

[17:37] <CIAvash> it's itemized Array

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, it's not often desirable and rather confusing

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> some stuff cares about type, including the reduce and hyper meta-operators

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> some stuff cares about containers, like foreach and zip

[17:38] <CIAvash> m: say [1,2] Z [3,4]; say $[1,2] Z [3,4] # like this

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «((1 3) (2 4))␤(([1 2] 3))␤»

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and it feels very quirky that I take an array that is itemized for some reason, convert it to an Array and suddenly it is containerized properly

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this takes me back to yesterday

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you set a @-sigilled variable to the topic variable, you cannot assign to it because Rakudo will claim it's "immutable"

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I've spent like half a year with Raku scripts, I've watched lizmat's presentation about sigils and still, most WAT's I come across are with sigil-dependent stuff and containerisation

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I saw in your examples that zen-slicing changed the behavior, I would say that's a clear-looking solution; I don't know what it did or where this is described but it seems like the cleanest solution

[17:46] *** Nemokosch left
[17:46] <CIAvash> maybe those functions you used that don't care about containers, are probably not `nodal`? https://docs.raku.org/routine/is%20nodal

[17:47] *** melezhik joined
[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I would also really like a working example of `nodal` with some non-method

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> with an infix hyper, even

[17:50] *** melezhik left
[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I don't think this is related to that map-zip example I've given

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, I'm reaching the point where I should probably collect my concerns about the whole containerisation stuff and make a post to Reddit

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> This map-zip stuff is something that I think we can sort out and I will eventually understand

[17:51] <CIAvash> no, I mentioned nodal because you mentioned hyper-operators

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but @variables as topic being immutable is an annoyance and the infamous (@a, @b) = (@b, @a) is plain satanic in my opinion

[17:52] <CIAvash> m: say [[1,2],[3,4]].map: -> @a { @a Z <1 2 3> } # another way to change containers

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «(((1 1) (2 2)) ((3 1) (4 2)))␤»

[17:53] <CIAvash> m: say [[1,2],[3,4]].map: -> $a { $a Z <1 2 3> } # same thing happening to $_

[17:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «((([1 2] 1)) (([3 4] 1)))␤»

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yes, I know this one; once I started suspecting that map takes scalar items, I expected this to work

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or @$_ to work (also does)

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I wondered if there is a clean way to change it within a whatever curry

[17:55] <CIAvash> Can you give an example for "but @variables as topic being immutable"

[17:56] <CIAvash> the clean way is either using `List`s or using `<>`.

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> *.List and *.Array work but I find them confusing - in fact I still don't really know why they change the containerisation and how this fits into the big picture

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so yeah, so far I like *<> the most

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or *[]

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> perhaps I could have used lists, I think it seemed easier to generate the data as an array

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, you know

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so apparently it works as expected if the outer dimension is a List

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> perhaps there can be a logical framework around this

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I ask myself the question - who will remember nuances like that, among mortal users?

[18:00] <CIAvash> I think Arrays have containers so you can modify them, unlike Lists. Then there is flattening, iterating, ... https://docs.raku.org/language/containers

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Lists still aren't immutable enough to be hashable, for example

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, so this is the implication of (shallow) immutability

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> (personally I also don't think the type hierarchy helps here, i.e Arrays descending from Lists)

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'll have to study this part thoroughly

[18:04] <CIAvash> If I'm not mistaken codesections is working on the immutability issue

[18:04] *** Nemokosch joined
[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, let me show you the two increasingly annoying things

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> And there are ValueLists that are hashable (or some related implication of deep immutability); they will be built in from 6.e from what I know

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> That's good news for sure

[18:05] <Nemokosch> so here's one:

[18:06] <Nemokosch> m: my @array = <1 2 3>; $_ = <4 5 6> given @array;

[18:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Cannot assign to an immutable value␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:06] *** reportable6 left
[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> of course if I type out @array, it will work

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know of an easy workaround for the left handside though

[18:07] *** reportable6 joined
[18:08] <Nemokosch> m: my $item-array = <1 2 3>; $_ = <4 5 6> given $item-array;

[18:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: ( no output )

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> dang, works with the scalar sigil

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I can't help but think that the so-called "item assignment" is more reliable overall

[18:10] <Nemokosch> And now let's perform the summoning ceremony of Raku

[18:11] <Nemokosch> m: my @a = <1>; my @b = <2>; (@a, @b ) = (@b, @a); dd @a; dd @b;

[18:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Array @a = ((my @Array_5770288009536) = [[], @Array_5770288009536])␤Array @b = []␤»

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> again, this would work as intended, had you used $

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> And yes, I asked about this, I think Jonathan Worthington explained the behavior (list assignment, STORE is called, it pushes all the values to the emptied @a variable so nothing is left for @b) but I still think this is too horrifying to be acceptable...

[18:17] *** Nemokosch left
[18:23] <CIAvash> yes, again it's because of containers, I know why it's immutable but not sure about `@a` being a value and `$a` being a container/variable

[18:24] <CIAvash> m: my @a = 1,2,3; given @a -> $a is raw { $a = [4,5,6] }; dd @a;

[18:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Cannot assign to an immutable value␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:25] <CIAvash> m: my @a = 1,2,3; given @a -> @b { @b = [4,5,6] }; dd @a;

[18:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [4, 5, 6]␤»

[18:25] <CIAvash> m: my @a = 1,2,3; given @a <-> $a { $a = [4,5,6] }; dd @a;

[18:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Parameter '$a' expects a writable container (variable) as an argument,␤but got '[1 2 3]' (Array) as a value without a container.␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:26] <CIAvash> m: my $a = [1,2,3]; given $a <-> $b { $b = [4,5,6] }; dd $a;

[18:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Array $a = $[4, 5, 6]␤»

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hmmm

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> does this mean that "item assignments" are literally impossible to list containered variables?

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> maybe all you have is this STORE method hidden behind "list assignments"?

[18:31] *** rypervenche left
[18:31] <CIAvash> apparently, I try to avoid mutability as much as I can and don't do these kind of things.

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean that's not a bad idea but that doesn't mean it should be a can of worms, right? 😄

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and especially this (@a, @b) = (@b, @a)

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> turns out it's not even easy to swap two variables if they happen to have this sigil

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean, other than using a temporary third variable like back in the days

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and for me, stuff like this definitely ruins my confidence with anything that seems like pattern matching

[23:10] <jujo> also where can I read about the methods of the dynamic $*IN

[23:11] <Voldenet> https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-$*IN

[23:11] <jujo> thankyou again :)

[23:18] <perryprog> :(

[23:19] <Voldenet> it's not perl, you can't just type in random things and expect it to work! :>

[23:21] <perryprog> haha

[23:22] <perryprog> m: P == NP

[23:22] <perryprog> that works in Perl 5, dangit!

[23:26] <jujo> if I want my program to behave differently depending on if I pass it files or I pipe a stream to it, how should I do it

[23:28] <jujo> nvm

[23:28] <jujo> just found out

[23:29] <Voldenet> probably just use "-" as argument, it's standard way to do it

[23:32] <Voldenet> eh, apparently .slurp won't do what you want

[23:32] <Voldenet> because slurp returns available content for $*IN

[23:33] <jujo> I'm declaring main with a slurpy array as argument

[23:33] <Voldenet> $*IN.slurp-rest is the method

[23:33] <jujo> and if it is empty I just treat it as input from stdin

[23:33] <jujo> (I could do some parsing before deciding)

[23:34] <jujo> is it too hacky?

[23:36] <Voldenet> makes sense

[23:38] <Voldenet> > sub MAIN(IO() :$file = "-") { $file.open.slurp-rest.chars.say }

[23:38] <Voldenet> that's how I'd do it

[23:45] <jujo> oh I see, I was just reading about the builtin arg parsing, very interesting

[23:45] <jujo> what if I want to have rest args after some flags?

[23:48] <Voldenet> > sub MAIN(IO() $in, :$out = "out") { $in.say; $out.say; }

[23:50] <Voldenet> if you want multiple unnamed arguments, you can use *@whatever as args, so

[23:51] <Voldenet> > sub MAIN(*@c, :$out = "out") { @c.join(";").say; $out.say; } 

[23:51] <Voldenet> keep in mind that in that case, named arguments must appear before unnamed ones

[23:51] <jujo> ok I understand

[23:51] <jujo> thanks again!

[23:52] <jujo> you can declare MAIN as multi right?

[23:52] <Voldenet> Yes
