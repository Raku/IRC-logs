[00:16] <leont> That's not yet implemented, and that's getting in my way too
[00:16] <reol> i took a look at the implementation
[00:18] <reol> i havent worked with libuv but i suppose it is similar to libev(ent). exposing AF_UNIX would probably be fairly simple
[00:18] <reol> but i also found bugs in the current implementation
[00:18] <leont> #moarvm may be the better channel for questions about that
[00:23] <epony> next invention, generic and anon sockets ;-)
[00:24] <epony> types: P- Q- R- S- T- types
[00:24] <reol> is there an API to check the errno of failed socket ops?
[00:25] <epony> the idea behind those socket types is to simulate digital electronics with logic functions and triggers built on them as distributed nodes

[11:22] <leont> Fortunately, I already have an idea for next time that is less ranty, whenever that will be
[11:31] <lizmat> perhaps we should organize an online rantathon ?

[12:21] <ugexe> Strange, I'm getting a "Cannot assign to an immutable value" on Windows but not macOS
[12:21] <ugexe> error: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ugexe/perl6-compunit-repository-lib/builds/44710987#L1366
[12:21] <ugexe> line 60: https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-CompUnit--Repository--Lib/blob/76d482639b3c27c411ba5eef8ffa7f0f2644889f/lib/CompUnit/Repository/Lib.rakumod#L60
[12:35] <lizmat> could you run it with spesh disabled ?
[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> where's the best place for a raku module Build.pm to install a custom lib.so (unix only for now)?
[12:51] <ugexe> p6steve: declare it in meta6 under 'resources' as `libraries/lib`, and then have Build.pm generate the file to resources/libraries/ 
[12:51] <tellable6> ugexe, I'll pass your message to p6steve
[12:52] <ugexe> files under resources/libraries will have their name changed as system appropriate, so on linux 'lib' would create 'liblib.so', or 'Foo' would generate libFoo.so
[12:52] <ugexe> see Inline::Perl5's libraries/p5helper meta6.json entry
[12:53] <ugexe> lizmat: same error from CI with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1
[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ugexe: thanks - I'll take a look
[12:55] <lizmat> ugexe: maybe something is binding to meta<files> somewhere instead of assigning, possibly dependent on OS ?
[12:56] <lizmat> src/core.c/Distribution/Path.pm6
[12:56] <lizmat> 18:        %!meta<files> := my %files;
[12:57] *** Kaiepi left
[12:58] <ugexe> there isn't any os dependent code in the module itself at least
[12:58] <ugexe> well there is one minor thing but its unrelated
[13:02] <lizmat> well, Distribution::Path appears to be binding ?
[13:02] <lizmat> disclaimer: I only looked at the rak search output
[13:03] <ugexe> but i'd expect windows and non-windows systems to behave he same
[13:05] <lizmat> agree
[13:06] <lizmat> I guess the only way to find out what's in there, is to actually put debug code in there that shows what's in there blocking the assignment
[13:19] <ugexe> class Foo is Distribution::Path { submethod TWEAK(|) { self.meta<files> := self.meta<files>.hash; } }; say Foo.new($*CWD).meta<files>
[13:19] <evalable6> ugexe, rakudo-moar 7342d9dc2: OUTPUT: ¬´{}‚ê§¬ª
[13:19] <ugexe> that doesn't reproduce the error
[13:28] <lizmat> if you change that bind in Distribution::Path to an assignent, does it go away ?
[13:29] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&
[13:45] <tonyo> m: class F00 is Distribution::Path { submethod TWEAK(|) { self.meta<files> = self.meta<files>.hash; }}; say F00.new($*CWD).meta<files>

[15:18] <ugexe> if the Lib.rakumod code does `self.meta<files> :=` instead of `self.meta<files> =` it works
