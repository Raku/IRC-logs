[00:03] <elcaro> doing `.fmt('%2d')` rather than '%.2d' will pad the numbers with a space, rather than a zero, which is more likely what you want (and saves a byte!)

[00:05] <elcaro> also, `.rotor($n, :partial)` is shorter as `.batch($n)`

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-09-28T08:22:07Z #raku <lizmat> Nemokosch: I guess you could get the release date from the latest date of the first tar file

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-10-02T10:49:24Z #raku <El_Che> Nemokosch: be careful with terminology because they will look up stuff while learning

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-10-02T13:27:47Z #raku <andinus> Nemokosch: ah i see

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-10-02T16:13:55Z #raku <El_Che> Nemokosch: what's special about Raku's variables

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-10-04T20:34:27Z #raku <guifa_> Nemokosch: that was designed to be part of raku's oddly consistent state.  -1 is actually negating prefix + value

[08:10] <tellable6> 2022-10-04T21:22:54Z #raku <guifa_> Nemokosch: I think it should be eventually solvable.  RakuAST in particular would make inserting a negative value there extremely easy

[08:11] *** bpalmer left
[08:12] <Nemokosch> guifa_: I feel RakuAST is like the promised land. Everything will be shiny there, except it could be that none of us will live long enough. As long as there is no set schedule for it, I'd rather go with a workaround for now.

[20:58] <Nemokosch> liar, it works in the repl

[21:01] <Nemokosch> anyway, if it complains about "compile time", probably it would work with an EVAL at least

[21:12] <[Coke]> fails on CLI and in the REPL here, and in the REPL I get a weird backtrace also

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it looks just like a function call but it's in fact a type signature

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> probably won't ever do anything

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay, it' s a bit worse than I thought - fake-say() could be used as a type annotation and that variable could be called
