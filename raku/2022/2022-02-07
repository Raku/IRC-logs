[12:02] <elcaro> mental blank... what's  the sub version of $class."$method"()... ie, how can i calls sub `foo()` if `$var='foo'`

[12:02] <elcaro> oh wait... it's `::{'&foo'}()`

[12:02] <elcaro> stupid brain

[12:03] <elcaro> or `::{"&$var"}()` as the case may be

[12:30] <moritz> IMHO that's the least cluttered syntax if you want to call (and not get a reference to it)

[12:30] <moritz> m: sub f() {say "moo"}; my $name = 'f'; say &MY::{$name}

[12:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 34c938c58: OUTPUT: «&f␤»

[12:31] <moritz> if you want to get a reference

[20:09] <frank26> Hi, I have a problem wrt to building a module of mine with the debian package of rakudo. This is the module https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl. I do "zef install ." and end with "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -latomic_ops"

[20:11] <frank26> If I remove atomic_ops from the generated Makefile the module seems to be working.

[20:14] <[Coke]> ? what is -atomic_ops? 

[20:14] <[Coke]> ? what is -latomic_ops? 

[20:15] *** Darkcoal left
[20:16] <[Coke]> the only atomic_ops I have in my makefile is:

[20:16] <[Coke]>     -I'/Volumes/BUKKIT/Users/coke/sandbox/rakudo/install/include/libatomic_ops' \

[20:17] *** Darkcoal joined
[20:19] <[Coke]> File::Which should update to check for raku as a test instead of perl6

[20:19] <frank26> Hm that seems to be the directory containing the headers files of that library. -latomic_ops is for the linker.

[20:20] <[Coke]> I assume you mean the rakudo makefile, though it's not clear how that impacts your module.

[20:21] <[Coke]> (I was able to do a zef install --dry . in the module checkout, no errors) (I'm on OS X, though)

[20:23] <frank26> "zef" creates for my module a Makefile. In that Makefile is a linker line referring to atomic_ops

[20:23] *** anight[m] joined
[20:24] <ugexe> maybe something from LibraryMake that you use? https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake/blob/1c6bf1d0e427e51d880ac237e6d168c4919adbfd/lib/LibraryMake.pm6#L144-L147

[20:25] <[Coke]> ah. issue with LibraryMake perhaps? Or your debian package of rakudo being misconfigured?

[20:29] <frank26> Yes I think this https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl/blob/master/Makefile.in#L9 gets expanded with %LIBS%

[20:29] *** CIAvash joined
[20:29] <[Coke]> it concerns me that debian's version is still calling itself Perl 6

[20:29] *** AlexDaniel joined
[20:30] *** Darkcoal left
[20:30] <frank26> %LIBS% seems to be -lffi -ltommath -latomic_ops -luv -lm -lpthread -lrt -ldl

[20:33] *** frank26 left
[20:33] <[Coke]> ah, the MoarVM Makefile, not rakudo. Still, don't see a -latomic_ops in mine.

[20:34] *** frank67 joined
[20:34] <MasterDuke> moarvm uses libatomic_ops, i suspect you need to install the libatomic-ops-dev debian package

[20:34] <[Coke]> Shouldn't the package require it automagically?

[20:34] <frank67> Sorry I accidentally left the channel

[20:34] <[Coke]> (if it's going to die this way?)

[20:34] <[Coke]> and changed your ID. :)

[20:35] <MasterDuke> but i think it's only because building his module requires compiling some c code

[20:37] <MasterDuke> frank67: if you missed my earlier comment, "moarvm uses libatomic_ops, i suspect you need to install the libatomic-ops-dev debian package"

[20:37] <frank67> Yes indeed  libatomic-ops-dev solved that. I think I did not find that package, as I searched for atomic_ops ,not atomic-ops.

[20:39] *** unclechu joined
[20:39] *** bdju_ is now known as bdju

[20:40] <frank67> So is this a bug somewhere? My code does not use atomic_ops. Or should I update the readme to give a hint that this package might be required?

[20:41] <MasterDuke> fyi, if you build your own rakudo, moarvm recently gained the ability to use c11's atomic ops instead (assuming you have a supported OS+compiler), so you could pass `--moar-option='--c11-atomics'` to the rakudo Configure.pl call

[20:43] *** Zgredu[m] joined
[20:48] <frank67> I am still uncertain: how should I document the build procedure of my code, so that someone else could succeed building it? Does the native call machine require atomic_ops to be linked against the parts of the code I provided?

[20:50] <ugexe> for a debian package you probably shouldnt be running e.g. Build.pm

[20:51] <MasterDuke> i think he's saying he got his rakudo from a debian package, but is installing his module with zef

[20:52] <frank67> Yes exactly.

[20:52] <ugexe> if you can make it work without LibraryMake maybe try that

[20:54] <ugexe> or delete whatever entries from https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl/blob/8bcf5477a6f445a0abb3f2ee3f77fb65c5561a12/Build.pm#L9 you dont want

[21:00] <frank67> I think this is quite hard, especially if there are variants like  `--moar-option='--c11-atomics'` around.

[21:10] *** reportable6 joined
[21:11] <frank67> I will  add a pointer to libatomic-ops-dev (and the other not used libs like ) into the readme for now. The linker seems to prevent the extra libs being added to the shared library libtweetnacl.so

[22:28] *** Zgredu[m] joined
[22:28] <[Coke]> that also would have solved the issue; I imagine that rakudo will explode if you try to use the atomic ops.

[22:37] <[Coke]> ... except you already installed the dev lib. ah well.

[22:39] <MasterDuke> i don't believe so, it's just that LibraryMake (or whatever creates the Makefile) is guessing that the include line for the non-rakudo-related code needed to be compiled for that module should be copied from the moarvm build
