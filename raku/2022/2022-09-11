[00:04] <japhb> orylesor: There are other line editors for Raku (I wrote one of them, Terminal::LineEditor), but they all hook up Raku's completion lists to whatever completion behavior the line editor library offers.

[00:05] <japhb> However, I know some people have worked on notebook (e.g. Jupyter and Mathematica) engines for Raku, so those may help.

[00:06] <orylesor> Does that imply that completing variable names would require support from Raku or Rakudo itself?

[00:07] <japhb> Also, the Comma IDE (available in Community and Complete editions) has MUCH more powerful completion

[00:07] <japhb> Yes, except for the bit about Comma

[00:08] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o japhb

[00:09] <orylesor> Interesting, thank you.

[00:10] <japhb> orylesor: The data for Raku/Rakudo to be able to introspect everything that it would need to do variable tab completion is already there, just nobody has gotten around to wiring up the necessary bits in the REPL.

[00:11] <orylesor> I see!

[02:48] <orylesor> I just tried Jupyter Notebook and it indeed does completion!I'm really happy I've got the answer I was looking for. Thanks for the help, everyone!

[02:48] <orylesor> Y'all have a nice day. :)

[15:13] <Kaiepi> raku.land isn't picking up the v1.0.0 or v1.0.1 releases of Data::Record i made earlier

[15:13] <Kaiepi> v1.0.0 being around 6 hours ago

[15:14] <Kaiepi> it has picked up one module update between then and now though

[15:14] *** MoC joined
[15:15] <Kaiepi> and they are installable with zef

[15:31] <gfldex> Kaiepi: your META6.json reads: "perl" : "6.e.PREVEIW",

[15:31] <gfldex> The rest of the file looks ok tho. Not sure if that's the reason.

[15:33] <Kaiepi> ah

[15:35] <Kaiepi> we'll find out in half an hour i guess

[15:36] *** MoC left
[15:42] <gfldex> Do we keep the .PREVIEW subversion when we realase 6.e?

[15:55] <Kaiepi> i have another module that uses it that uploaded ok, but idk

[16:04] <Kaiepi> ah

[16:04] <Kaiepi> watching its build run

[16:04] <Kaiepi>  /cache/zef/b04b298bf39e072b207e9b47ece4c8d9263a9fb4: invalid input value for enum perl: "6.e.PREVEIW"

[17:25] <tbrowder> i might tackle a "new" pod issue, but what raku branch is best to checkout with -b ? main/master?
