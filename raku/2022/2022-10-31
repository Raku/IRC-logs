[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think Twitter has been a cursed platform for a long-long time but really, what do we even have for publicity

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Okay, I think even Facebook is miles better than twitter but Facebook-as-news-feed in the IT? Weird

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Maaaybe LinkedIn?

[10:51] <moritz> reddit exists

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes but 1. Reddit exists for a long time already 2. it's not really like a news feed 3. it suffers from the same echo chamber characteristics as Twitter

[10:54] <lizmat> which is why I've been publishing my posts on dev.to

[10:54] <moritz> well, for reddit, if you want publicity beyond the echo chamber, you have to post to /r/programming, not just to /r/rakulang

[10:54] <lizmat> hmmm.. that's a good point  :-)

[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> dev.to was also a good idea

[15:00] <Xliff_> japh \o

[15:01] <Xliff_> japh: Why is my output looking like a stairstep with TErminal::Print::DecodedInput running?

[15:02] <Xliff_> lizmat: Can we have a String.lop that does the opposite of String.chop?

[15:03] <Xliff_> It would add such wonderful symmetry.

[15:08] <japhb> Xliff_: Because the terminal has to be in raw mode for the supply to work properly.  Something like ReadKey can pop in and out of raw mode for a single keystroke, but that doesn't work well when you've got a long-running supply.

[15:08] <japhb> (And raw mode doesn't implicitly CR when you LF)

[15:16] <Xliff_> So I have to add CRs to my output?

[15:23] <tonyo> .tell tbrowder not sure if you saw my note about the CSVs.  the monospace font on that site is Source Code Pro (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you know Arne Sommer by any chance?

[16:20] <japhb> Xliff_: Yeah, adding CRs should work.  Basically in raw mode you have to be very explicit; the terminal infrastructure doesn't DWIM anymore in that mode.

[16:23] <japhb> Xliff_: decoded-input-supply reads from raw-input-supply (https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/RawInput.pm6) which stays in raw mode as long as it hasn't been closed.

[16:24] <japhb> (This is yet another improvement when I wrote the code in Terminal::LineEditor -- it knows how to smoothly exit and return to raw mode as desired.)

[16:56] <tonyo> .tell tbrowder you're also welcome to take over the CSV::Parser repo 

[16:56] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[16:56] <tonyo> i did that in 2010 for a POS log parsing project i needed a CSV parser for and haven't looked much at it since

[16:59] <tbrowder> thnx for invite, but i‚Äôm not sure i am capable of properly handling the binary stuff. also, i would probably chg the API to suit my coding style.

[17:02] <tonyo> i probably would too, was also my first raku project/module

[17:03] <tbrowder> i think it would be best to turn it over to the group repo. then there is less chance of a kerfuffle

[17:04] <[Coke]> We should only be taking things into group that we're agreeing to maintain

[17:04] <[Coke]> we shouldn't be where modules go to die.

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think it's good that there is something like this at all

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wish more de facto abandoned modules ended up there, it's still much better than to be de facto abandoned

[18:44] <[Coke]> there are some on that list that are already in 'raku-community-modules', which seems a contradiction
