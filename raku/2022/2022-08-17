[00:08] <tonyo> if you're a bash user then you can upgrade the ancient version that ships with osx using brew
[00:10] <guifa_> Ah, I think you meant just for Raku stuff 
[00:13] *** jgaz left
[00:14] *** jaguart left
[00:14] *** jaguart joined
[00:17] <Xliff> guifa_: Well... Raku stuff too.
[00:17] <Xliff> I have Raku and brew setup.
[00:27] <Xliff> tonyo: Yeah, I had a time upgrading to Bash 5. I'm still on zsh until I get that fixed.
[00:28] <tonyo> what's the issue?  if you install via brew you need to add it to /etc/shells so chsh allows it
[00:29] <Xliff> Yeah, and when I do that, stuff like "brew" stops working.
[00:29] <Xliff> So I have to get my path straight.
[00:29] <tonyo> oh -- heh , guessing you need to add the right shell hooks to ~/.bash_profile
[00:30] <Xliff> Yeah... and I just haven't had the time to.
[00:30] <Xliff> I'm on the PC, right now.
[00:31] <Xliff> Trying to find an answer to some issue that might affect my embryonic Gnome Shell raku bindings.
[00:31] <Xliff> 770,000 lines of Raku and growing.
[00:44] <guifa_> If you have any non-Apple-based wireless speakers, Airfoil is a pretty obligatory program — makes it easy for me to stream to other types of speakers
[00:44] * guifa_ uses a Mac, but is firmly in camp Google for everything but his desktop OS
[00:47] <guifa_> Textual is the better IRC client if you want something modern.  Otherwise, standard command line ones work fine ofc
[00:51] <Xliff> Can I download Textual? I currently am waiting for Apple to restore my itunes account.
[00:53] <Xliff> Aha! I can.
[00:53] <Xliff> And I did.

[01:06] <jaguart> so newbie opinion - pod6 is a pita - convince me I'm wrong please
[01:06] <tonyo> i
[01:06] <XliffyMac> OK, how can I set the font size for the user list in Textual?
[01:06] <tonyo> i've used pods for years, i don't disagree
[01:07] <XliffyMac> I love the Pre and Post declarator PODs. Just ask guifa.
[01:08] <jaguart> yeah - nah, better in other lang/tooling. dont understand why Raku brought pod along
[01:08] <XliffyMac> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/c78fb770c8b1d23d2b7be0bdb007e9c6
[01:08] <tonyo> that and TAP
[01:10] <jaguart> Xliff - that is nice - but =head Heading and =item1 blah
[01:10] <tonyo> @xliff more interesting to me would be a slang that behaves like datalog for querying sqls
[01:11] <XliffyMac> tonyo: Got a link?
[01:11] <tonyo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog
[01:11] <tonyo> i'll write your examples in datalog-ish 
[01:15] <Xliff> Cool! Toss 'em in the gist comments.
[01:15] <Xliff> Something like this? 
[01:15] <Xliff> https://docs.xtdb.com/language-reference/datalog-queries/
[01:15] <guifa_> Xliffy: I'm not sure on that one, I haven't styled it too extensively (plus I like fairly small text personally....one of my gripes about apple's new UIs being all iOS-y with way too much whitespace)
[01:15] <Xliff> guifa_: Ah, no worries. Thanks!
[01:18] <guifa_> I don't mind pod6.  Though, to be fair, I don't use all of its features that extensively.  But I like the idea of them.  Definitely a few things I'd change though but there's some room for growth I think at leat while its not super highly adopted in the wild outside of Rakudocs
[01:21] *** XliffyMac left
[01:24] <jaguart> what bugs me is the unreadability of the =pod sections when viewing code. I'd replace the content with markdown
[01:25] <jaguart> and the semantic sections - no real guidelines except cpan history
[01:26] <jaguart> which is ok - just not really defined, so varies enormously
[01:27] <jaguart> the main thing missing though is the javadoc equiv - complete interactive codebase exploration
[01:28] <jaguart> which probably will result in everyone rolling their own
[01:29] <Xliff> Guys -- check the new comment I wrote here: https://gist.github.com/Xliff/c78fb770c8b1d23d2b7be0bdb007e9c6
[01:31] <jaguart> the beauty of your second comment is that you could extend support for non-sql or different flavours of sql 
[01:32] <Xliff> jaquart: Yep. JUST made that point in an edit.
[01:32] <jaguart> one thing - most of my SQL is somewhat interpolated - even when the args are parameterised
[01:32] <Xliff> jaguart: That is handled through a different mechanism.
[01:32] <guifa_> jaguart: that's one reason I've been slowly experimenting with it.  Just like I'm trying to push for us having well coded modules early in the ecosystem to guide the way, I think I will eventually try to do a similar approach with POD6
[01:33] <Xliff> At that point, the query becomes more of a view and is processed like a template (and in many cases IS a template)
[01:33] <guifa_> consistency of use will engender greater utility
[01:33] <guifa_> But there's also that huge chicken and egg problem
[01:33] <guifa_> Right now, everyone just uses Markdown because, well, README.md is enough and no one likes writing docs anyways
[01:34] <jaguart> guifa: yes - imagine if you just embeded your README.md in your =doc section...
[01:35] <guifa_> I think my initial push is going to be for a lot bigger use of declarator pod.  That's fairly unambiguous in how it should be used, and is super IDE friendly
[01:36] <jaguart> I do like the declarators - they are easy to read
[01:36] <guifa_> I've still been mulling over how best to use some of the other features for the best of literate coding with docs processing
[01:36] <jaguart> I'd just like to adopt some recommends for markdown and javadoc-like standards
[01:36] <guifa_> But I'm going to need to do a lot of experimentation I'm sure before I get what I think works best
[01:37] <jaguart> I'm of the opion that we just use what actually works in the wild
[01:37] <jaguart> sure tweak it to make it rakuish, but why invent a new set of semantics
[01:38] <jaguart> and also why invent a new flavour of markdown
[01:40] <tonyo> pod was around before markdown
[01:41] <jaguart> yes - and it shows :)
[01:43] <jaguart> I'll probably ask again - docs are a bugbear of mine. I've written my thoughts at https://jaguart.tech/raku-pod6-is-a-pita
[01:43] <jaguart> I am off though - its 3:40 in France - au revoir
[01:44] <tonyo> you could write a slang to use markdown rather than pod
[01:44] <tonyo> and it would likely gain some success, particularly from non-perlers
[01:44] <jaguart> tonyo: thanks - this newbie will look at 'slangs'
[01:52] *** jaguart left
[01:58] <guifa_> Slangs are fun
[01:58] <guifa_> haha
[01:59] <guifa_> Of course I realized after releasing my recent slang I found I had accidentally commented out a bunch of tests
[01:59] <guifa_> and so there were a few bugs

[18:11] <jjatria> I've been looking into what it would take to make PublicSuffix accept user-provided lists, and it's doing my head in
[18:11] <tellable6> 2022-08-17T02:18:19Z #raku <melezhik> jjatria - I think this is something you might be interested to run PublicSuffix cron jobs - Cromtit - https://github.com/melezhik/Cromtit ( Cro(ntab) + Tomtit )
[18:11] <tellable6> 2022-08-17T15:01:21Z #raku <melezhik> jjatria it's WIP, however is it something you might be into? Asking at the early state of design ...
[18:12] <jjatria> Because if I do, then it means that it could be loaded with two different lists in two different scopes
[18:12] <jjatria> And since Raku likes to keep things lexical, what you'd expect is for those two scopes to have access to two different lists
[18:13] *** pamplemoussecach left
[18:13] <jjatria> But then that means that the functions I export need to close over the list they were imported with
[18:14] <tonyo> m: say ('foobar' ~~ /foob|\w+?/);
[18:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢f｣␤»
[18:14] <tonyo> m: say ('foobar' ~~ /foob||\w+?/);
[18:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢foob｣␤»
[18:14] <jjatria> And that's when I start wondering whether it makes sense to go through all that trouble... and the current automatic release with precompiled lists starts looking a hell of a lot more attractive
[18:15] <tonyo> seems like that | and || is backwards, either in docs or in implementation
[18:15] <jjatria> You want different lists on different scopes? Import different versions. Easy. I might punt on this
[18:16] <tonyo> m: say ('foobar' ~~ /fooc||\w+?/);
[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢f｣␤»
[18:16] <tonyo> m: say ('foobar' ~~ /fooc|\w+?/);
[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢f｣␤»
[18:17] <wafflus> @tonyo thanks i'm never too sure as i'm a bit of a noob
[18:18] *** pamplemoussecach joined
[18:18] <tonyo> m: say ('foobar' ~~ /foob|\w+/);
[18:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢foobar｣␤»
[18:18] <tonyo> wafflus: part of it is that's not a very good regex since `foob` is a subset of `\w+`
[18:19] <wafflus> well maybe of course its just an example i'm never quite sure which way is the better way when doing regexes but it does seem like a ubg
[18:19] <wafflus> bug
[18:19] <tonyo> m: say ('2a31238' ~~ /\d\w|\d\w\d+?/);
[18:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6c948e006: OUTPUT: «｢2a3｣␤»
[18:20] <wafflus> i guess i can just stick to normal alteration using ||
[18:20] <tonyo> that does look like a bug in either the docs or in the implementation
[18:20] <wafflus> or use non greedy its kind of hard when you can't predict things
[18:22] <wafflus> i mean greedy
[18:22] <tonyo> i think if you don't have the subset idea then it should be fine in practice to do it the way intended by the docs
[18:23] <tonyo> that last regex example shows the pipe doing it's thing
[18:26] <wafflus> anyways thanks
