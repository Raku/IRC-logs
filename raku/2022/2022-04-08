[00:24] <SmokeMachine> johnny, drakonis: you can express the version of your dependencies on your META6.json, but to have that to the whole tree of dependencies, I think the only way is to only depend on dependencies that express the wanted version of their dependencies…

[20:04] <drakonis> apparently, europe has the lion's hare of the base here
[20:05] <grizzlysmit> Ok I am from Australia I guess we take turns sleep wise huh
[20:06] *** spacekookie joined
[20:10] <japhb> grizzlysmit: There are a few of us from the Americas, and a few from Asia, but yeah, the largest single group of active people on the channel is in Europe.
[20:13] <grizzlysmit> OK that explain the lack of activity
[20:14] <drakonis> that can always improve in time as raku gets known
[20:15] <MasterDuke> i wonder if the discord channel has a different geographic distribution of users
[20:15] <grizzlysmit> yes, it's an awesome language it deserves more support
[20:16] <grizzlysmit> Ok discord I try that later
[20:17] <drakonis> the most active channel there is the beginners channel anyways
[20:17] <drakonis> and its bridged to irc
[20:18] <drakonis> as well as the main raku channel for the folks that dont come over on irc very often
[20:19] <grizzlysmit> OK I'm not really a beginner been using Raku since it was perl6 and early in that time
[20:24] *** Tirifto left
[20:25] <drakonis> raku needs a killer app
[20:25] <drakonis> also some assembler maybe?
[20:26] <drakonis> so it doesnt need to screw around with ffi for compiling weird code
[20:27] <[Coke]> NativeCall seems superior to assembler.
[20:27] <drakonis> i've seen judicious use of it in D for a numpy replacement that doesnt require specific code for multidimensional arrays
[20:27] <[Coke]> (though I haven't had to deal with assembler in ... 2 decades?)
[20:28] <drakonis> oh, do tell though
[20:28] <drakonis> https://forum.dlang.org/post/yihbegggrvrqcltfhwtz@forum.dlang.org
[20:29] <drakonis> its for the number crunching stuff i'd say
[20:31] <drakonis> perhaps i might be misunderstanding that post?
[20:32] <drakonis> i'm sure it'd be possible to do it in raku anyways
[20:33] <drakonis> not sure how performant it can be though

[20:39] <drakonis> [Coke]: how does nativecall replace assembler?
[20:41] *** Tirifto joined
[20:42] <drakonis> i also meant an inline assembler
[20:42] <drakonis> for those hand rolled ops and such
[20:43] <drakonis> surprisingly enough, no asm calls on mir
[20:44] <drakonis> so i stand corrected.

[21:41] <drakonis> hm, so mir actually uses inline assembly, oh well.
[21:43] <[Coke]> sorry, not a direct replacement for assembly, just gets you to C. the rakudo jit itself is using assembly, though. It's just not exposed as a user-space feature.
[21:51] <moon-child> a closer analogue to asm would seem to be nqp
[21:52] <moon-child> it is not there yet, but I think it has the potential to be good for tight numerics

[23:10] <Xliff> "Cannot iterate object with P6opaque representation (ContainerDescriptor)"
[23:11] <[Coke]> anything change on your end? did it work in an older version of rakudo and not this one?
[23:11] <[Coke]> Are you using a release version or rakudo HEAD?
[23:13] <[Coke]> (afk)

[23:30] <Xliff> [Coke] - Unless mentioned, I'm always on a HEAD no longer than a week old.
[23:30] <Xliff> And I figured out a workaround, so thanks.

[23:44] <melezhik> @SmokeMachine I am going to add MySQL / PostgreSQL support to SparkyCI soon, will be you interested to try it out for Red testing ?
[23:45] <SmokeMachine> melezhik: that would be great! :)
[23:45] <melezhik> Here is an example of MySQL service - https://twitter.com/melezhik2/status/1512573832594341899?s=21
[23:46] <melezhik> It's not complete , however one can see the idea
[23:46] <melezhik> Red does not support MySQL yet, correct ?
[23:48] <SmokeMachine> not yes... but I'm working on it... https://github.com/FCO/Red-Driver-MySQL
[23:48] <melezhik> Anyway the same postgresql could be bootstrapped to SparkyCI
