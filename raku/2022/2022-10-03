[14:16] <nine> Reading that weekly makes me realize what a hero lizmat++ is. Not just for writing the weekly, but the "Meanwhile on Twitter" section always contains some threads where someone is mentioning Raku or even Perl 6 and lizmat provides some basic facts. Most won't care, but these little drops accumulate and become an effective way to spread the word.

[22:10] <lizmat> nine ugexe given a string site#sources/DA84AE654C9BE5E52E114BFD2BFDF99BC47BC220 , how can I reliably change the "site#" part into an absolute path?

[22:10] <leont> lizmat: could I have your opinion on https://github.com/Leont/app-prove6/pull/12/files? I think we discussed such a thing on some ticket, but I forgot which

[22:12] <lizmat> wow, must be a while ago..  maybe at a PTS ?     seems like a valid addition to me  :-)
