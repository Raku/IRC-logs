[04:27] <vrurg> .tell patrickb I nailed down one more problem about dynamic libraries and rakubrew and it's rather important: https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/9#issuecomment-1045727598 

[04:27] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to patrickb

[06:48] <guifa> is there any way to produce an NQPMatch instead of a Match?

[06:49] <guifa> I tried a new slang technique, but it seems like Match and NQPMatch are just enough different to cause problems

[08:51] <nine> guifa: maybe you should postpone your slang experiments and help with finishing RakuAST instead? :)

[15:36] <leont> How quickly should dists show up in recent distributions?

[15:54] <lizmat> leont depends on where they are uploaded

[15:55] <lizmat> zef almost immmediately, p6c and cpan up to 4 hours

[15:55] <lizmat> rea about an hour

[16:06] <japhb> rea?

[16:06] <japhb> Oh, right, the backpan

[16:06] <lizmat> Raku Ecosystem Archive

[16:06] <lizmat> yup

[16:07] <lizmat> fg

[16:08] <lizmat> oops

[16:11] <leont> Now it's showing up on raku.land but when using zef

[16:48] <MasterDuke> did you run `zef update`?

[16:55] <leont> Probably should move to zef ecosystem, but hadn't really looked at that yet

[17:17] <guifa> nine: I'm not opposed to that at all.  I just don't really understand the compile process itself well enough to be of much use.  If someone could walk me through the process for making one of the nodes, maybe I can be of more use there.  I just feel bad asking for someone to basically give me a deep dive tutorial

[17:25] <lizmat> guifa: I did give a presentation about just that at FOSDEM :-)

[17:37] <guifa> lizmat wait did you?  I thought yours was on BackPAN ?

[17:44] *** jjido joined
[17:52] <lizmat> maybe I'm misunderstanding?

[17:53] <lizmat> I thought your question was wrt moving to zef and how the ecosystems interlock ?

[18:31] <guifa> lizmat no... I mean, I want to help out with RakuAST

[18:31] <guifa> node = RakuAST::Node

[18:31] <lizmat> aaah... ok...  right

[18:32] <lizmat> ok... yes, that would be excellent  :-)

[18:32] <lizmat> and I did *not* give a presentation about that on FOSDEM  :-)

[18:33] <guifa> Like, i get how the RakuAST nodes piece together, but it's converting them to work with Rakudo (which it seems like just converts RakuAST nodes to QAST nodes, but I know there's not a 1:1 correlation there, and there's a lot of other stuff that goes on). 

[18:35] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm not 100% clear on that either, and I think that part is also not 100% clear in jnthn's mind  :-)

[18:35] <lizmat> the goal is to eliminate World.nqp

[18:35] <lizmat> that much I know

[18:35] <lizmat> so somehow all of the functionality in there, will need to be "objectified" in such a way that it can all live in RakuAST nodes

[18:35] <lizmat> is my understanding  :-)

[18:36] <guifa> yeah, so … I dunno what I can do to help out with RakuAST other than try to break it hahahahahaha.  But I'd be absolutely willing to help out if I know what to do 

[18:37] <lizmat> writing tests is something that I've run behind on

[18:37] <lizmat> so if you could pick that up, that would be brill

[18:37] <lizmat> it's in a way trying to break it  :-)

[18:38] <guifa> ah okay.  That I can do.  Those test cases were actually amazing for me figuring out how to do RakuAST

[18:38] <guifa> and I saw a few areas where I felt like I could add some stuff

[18:39] <lizmat> yeah, so please do!  :-)

[18:39] <guifa> (and, I think, a few where things changed because jnhtn switched from single positional to multi named args)

[18:39] <lizmat> you're probably way into it more than I was  :-

[18:39] <lizmat> )

[18:39] <lizmat> yup...

[18:41] <guifa> on a slightly unrelated note… crazy thing with my slang work is I've now found about four different ways for one grammar to embed into another.  I should probably mention all four of them in the problem-solving post.  They're all quite similar and feel like TIMTOWTDI overkill

[18:43] <guifa> <.LANG(Grammar)>, <nibble: …>, <Grammar::TOP>, method foo { return Grammar.subparse }

[18:43] <guifa> oh, and :lang(foo) but I think that ended up as NYI from design docs
