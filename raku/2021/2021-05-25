[02:01] <moon-child> is there an 'apply' function?
[02:07] <elcaro> what specifically do you want to do that isn't covered by .map or .reduce?
[02:10] <elcaro> The only lisp I've used is Racket. Racket's `(apply + '(1 2 3))` can be expressed in Raku as `[+] (1, 2, 3)` or `(1, 2, 3).reduce(* + *)`
[02:11] <elcaro> ... among other ways
[02:13] <moon-child> I think the more natural dual is |.  E.G. infix:<+>(|<1 2 3>)
[02:14] <moon-child> in this case I have a sequence of functions that I want to apply to a single object.  Not hard to express, but it would be nice to be able to say [&f, &g, &h...].map(&apply.assuming: *, $object)
[02:16] <elcaro> are you opposed to: (&f, &g, &g).map(-> &func { func($object) })
[02:17] <moon-child> not opposed, certainly.  I just think the first version is a bit prettier
[02:18] <dac> Sometimes when I start raku for the first time in a while it can take upward of 20 seconds to become interactive, is there anything that might be causing that?
[02:19] *** dac is now known as dcx
[02:20] <moon-child> probably precompiling the standard library.  That only happens for when I upgrade
[02:20] <dcx> Ah makes sense 
[02:41] <dcx> It would be neat if there was just a small message saying that was happening, it's a little confusing

[04:20] <guifa> so that gets me the keys inside of class B

[08:30] <lizmat> hero image ?
[08:31] <Altreus> like when you have one big image for its own merit
[08:31] <lizmat> yes, every issue of the Rakudo Weekly News had one
[08:31] <Altreus> literally only just realised :D
[08:31] <Altreus> although that's probably exactly how it should be
[08:32] <lizmat> ah, I guess then I failed this week ?  :-)
[08:32] <Altreus> Well I thought of that too
[08:32] <Altreus> Maybe I'm just more on the ball today :D
[08:33] <lizmat> all but 2 of them, come from my personal picture collection

[09:26] <Altreus> Has anyone else tried Joplin? I happen to be looking for a shared todo/notes app for the business

[09:28] <dakkar> for my notes & todo I use NextCloud, but that's a big PHP application suite (it replaced most of Google services for me, and it runs on my own server)
[09:28] <dakkar> may not be appropriate for your use case
[09:32] *** jraspass left
[09:37] <Altreus> I think Opus uses NextCloud
[09:37] <Altreus> I think there's also another thing with a similar name
[09:37] <Altreus> That's gonna be useful in future when we don't want to rely on Google Drive for all our shared docs
[09:37] <dakkar> OwnCloud, of which NextCloud is a fork?
[09:38] <Altreus> ah that might be it
[09:38] <Altreus> Didn't realise they were related!
[09:38] <Altreus> one of them is good and works well - probably NextCloud
[09:38] <tyil> nextcloud works great for me and the missus
[09:40] <dakkar> it's free software with commercial backing, so it will probably not die soon ☺

[09:57] *** kawaii_ is now known as kawaii
[10:02] <raydiak> I suspect it has something to do with how the core ops are written explicitly into the grammar...
[10:04] <raydiak> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1237
[10:08] <dakkar> also, having one candidate have a different *parsing* than others, is not exactly a sensible thing to do
[10:08] <dakkar> because the parsing has to happen before all type information is available

[10:27] <dakkar> uh… that worked differently on my machine
[10:28] <lizmat> it should probably complain about assigning associativity to candidates, rather than the proto
[10:28] <Xliff> lizmat++: I expect RakuAST will solve a lot of things and give us new bugs we didn't expect.

[10:30] <raydiak> Xliff: the core grammar is https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp
[10:31] <dakkar> lizmat: AIUI, having candidates with different assoc/precedence should just be prohibited, because it can't be made to work
[10:31] <lizmat> any assoc trait on a candidate is just ignored, apparently
[10:31] <lizmat> compar:
[10:31] <lizmat> m: multi sub infix:<foo>(\a,\b) is assoc<left> { "foo" }; dd &infix:<foo>.prec
[10:31] <MasterDuke> couldn't it work if they have non-overlapping types?

[10:31] <lizmat> m: proto sub infix:<foo>(|) is assoc<left> {*}; multi sub infix:<foo>(\a,\b) { "foo" }; dd &infix:<foo>.prec
[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4183cdaf3: OUTPUT: «Hash element = {:assoc("left"), :prec("t=")}␤»
[10:32] <dakkar> MasterDuke: no, because associativity is a parse-time thing, and at parse-time you (almost)never have enough typing information
[10:32] <lizmat> so you're telling the candidate something, but nobody's listening :-)
[10:33] <dakkar> not exactly… 
[10:33] <dakkar> m: multi sub infix:<☞>(Int $a, Int $b) is assoc<left> {  return $a+$b*1000 };multi sub infix:<☞>(Str $a, Str $b) is assoc<right> { return "($a,$b)" };sub foo($a,$b,$c) { return $a☞$b☞$c };say foo(1,2,3);

[10:33] <dakkar> notice that the associativity changed
[10:33] <dakkar> it's taken from the first candidate seen
[10:33] <lizmat> hmmm... 
[10:34] <lizmat> worth an issue, I'd say, if there isn't one already
[10:34] <dakkar> there is: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1237
[10:34] <dakkar> although it may be reworded to more explicitly point out that the problem is the "silently", not the "fails"
[10:35] <dakkar> declaring candidates with different assoc/prec should be a compile-time erorr

[10:37] <lizmat> I guess you could, but it will only affect code compiled *after* that change
[10:37] <lizmat> so you'd need to do that at compile time, and it wouldn't affect any code compiled *before* that change
[10:38] <dakkar> isn't "I want this to be parsed different than normal raku" exactly what slangs are for?

[15:12] <[Coke]> is it possile that running the REPL for the first time ends up precompiling something?
[15:12] <[Coke]> *possible
[15:12] <[Coke]> Finding that the REPL on windows is very slow to start (2021.04)
[15:13] <[Coke]> ah. it's not doing anything in the background, just hanging. :(
[15:13] <ugexe> you could run `RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 raku` to find out
[15:14] <[Coke]> ah: under 'cmd', it launches immediately. under 'git bash', it hangs.
[15:15] <lizmat> it shouldn't precompile anythinkg
[15:15] <lizmat> then it probably cannot read STDIN in that case ?
[15:22] <[Coke]> lizmat: tried cmd/powershell; even under the right codepage (65001), the welcome to message isn't rendering. Guessing we'd need some kind of font fallback mechanism? 
[15:23] <lizmat> so you're saying the rendering of the welcome message is what's blocking ?

[15:39] *** renormalist left
[15:39] *** renormalist joined
[15:39] <ugexe> i guess it doesnt suprise me that it doesnt work under git bash, since that is probably a more cygwin toolchain like setup and you likely used VS toolchain to build rakudo
[15:39] <[Coke]> happy to test while I have the windows box up if there's anything else I can run.
[15:40] <[Coke]> I did use VS. note that raku works fine in scripts, just not in REPL there.
[15:41] <ugexe> raku -e 'say $*SPEC.raku'
[15:41] <[Coke]> (could very well be DIHWIDT)
[15:41] <ugexe> what does that say in git bash by chance
[15:41] <[Coke]> IO::Spec::Win32
[15:42] <renormalist> https://raku.org/ still talks about freenode for IRC.
[15:43] <ugexe> the repl worked for me on windows using 2020.04. building 2021.05 now
[15:43] <[Coke]> ugexe: again, works fine here in cmd & powershell.
[15:44] <ugexe> ah so the issue in cmd is just the jumbled text?
[15:44] <renormalist> https://rakudo.org/ also has a link to freenode near the bottom
[15:45] <[Coke]> ugexe: aye
[15:45] <ugexe> yeah thats been that way for a bit. i argued against it but im not a lawyer
[15:45] <[Coke]> which is very likely just a font issue; tried various system fonts, tried source code pro, nada. I think on the mac there's a fallback font for unicode, not sure that exists on windows.
[15:46] <[Coke]> well, the message is useless on windows at the moment, at least for me. I opened a ticket if someone wants to use that to argue we should at least default to plain text.
[15:46] <ugexe> well asking the average window user to change their terminal settings is a pretty big ask considering i dont think any other language does so
[15:47] <[Coke]> I think it makes sense to get to the unicode features of the language; not to see the welcome message.
[15:47] <ugexe> aye
[15:47] <lizmat> renormalist: thanks for the headsup
[15:48] <lizmat> renormalist: I think we have all the changes done, it's now a matter of deploying :-)

[20:44] <lichtkind> us here the organizer of raku conf?
[20:44] <lichtkind> what kind of talk do you want?
[20:54] *** mtj left
[21:03] <raydiak> we've moved to irc.libera.chat, you might have more luck there. it's also near our quiet time, as much of the community is in europe where it's getting late. if you wanted to try e-mail or other contact methods, they're listed on https://conf.raku.org/contacts
[21:04] <raydiak> in general though, I'd expect pretty much any talk related to the Raku language to be welcome
[21:23] <lichtkind> raydiak: thank you
[21:24] *** lichtkind joined
[21:27] <raydiak> you're welcome :)
[21:31] <lichtkind> raydiak: but channel there is 6667 
[21:34] *** mowcat left
[21:36] <raydiak> yes 6667 for unecrypted connections, 6697 for TLS
[21:37] <raydiak> actually, looks like there's more ports than that. see https://libera.chat/guides/connect
