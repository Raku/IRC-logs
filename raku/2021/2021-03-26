[11:15] <PimDaniel> Is there a faster way to return the indice of a first value found into an array.

[11:17] *** JJAtria[m] left
[11:17] <PimDaniel> my @a =<3,7,6,12,9,6,6,6> ; say first_indice_for(6) --> 2

[11:17] <PimDaniel> say first_indice_for(6,@a) --> 2 : i need to mention the array of course.

[11:36] <pmurias> hi

[11:37] <pmurias> how are things in Rakuland? Anything particularly exiting happening in the last year?

[11:38] *** wamba joined
[11:40] *** abraxxa left
[11:40] <lizmat> wow, where to start ?

[11:40] <patrickb> Well there are the two jnthn projects: RakuAST and the dispatcher rewrite.

[11:40] <lizmat> and there's MUGS

[11:41] <lizmat> cool new Comma and Cro features

[11:41] <patrickb> Apart from that, less bugs, more performance, more users.

[11:41] <patrickb> :-)

[11:41] <lizmat>   /r/rakulang crossed the 666 Rakoons mark at Christmas 2020, is now at 799

[11:42] <lizmat> pmurias: if you really want get up to date, you can look at https://rakudoweekly.blog/blog-feed/

[11:42] <patrickb> there is a new ecosystem: fez.

[11:43] <lizmat> there a Steering Council

[11:43] <patrickb> and a new module website: raku.land

[11:43] <patrickb> right, the RSC is a big thing that happened.

[14:32] <pmurias> lizmat: I look at the weekly sometimes but was curious about the momentum/direction of the language

[14:33] <pmurias> It's good to see jnthn back

[14:35] * leont really wishes he hadn't missed jnthn's presentation about Cro, I kind of needed it right now.

[14:36] <leont> Is my understanding correct that Cro is build for network protocols that have a request/response paradigm?

[14:36] <leont> (At least that's the case with all examples I've seen so far)

[14:36] <MasterDuke> pmurias: oh hey, just the person i was looking for!

[14:38] <MasterDuke> i was trying to build the nqp js backend to test https://github.com/Raku/nqp/pull/706 but it wasn't building. however, it didn't seem to me like the errors i was seeing would have been caused by my changes

[14:39] *** pmurias left
[14:41] <vrurg> leont: not only. There is also ZMQ module with support for at least pub/sub.

[14:41] <vrurg> leont: Cro implements reactive model, that'd be the most correct way to say.

[14:46] <notable6> patrickb, Noted! (weekly)

[14:47] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I think the js backend has bitrotted

[14:48] <pmurias> I am waiting for a train atm, but I haven't really maintained it recently

[14:52] <MasterDuke> ok, then i'll continue with the assumption that my changes didn't break anything

[14:55] <MasterDuke> pmurias: i see tons of graalvm/truffle news and hope the truffle backend makes more progress at some point, i just keep getting sidetracked by other projects

[15:47] <pmurias> Masterduke

[15:49] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I sometimes think about getting back to work on the truffle backend but it needs a not small about of work to get it to work with the new graalvm version

[15:49] *** camelia joined
[15:50] <pmurias> And I am distracted with the newish work and have been kind of depressed often last year so I don't get as much stuff done as I wish for

[17:22] <tbrowder> hi, folks, just been bitten by / vs div for integer division

[17:23] <tbrowder> is there any way to have Raku warn of situation where both operands are Int and the operator is '/' instead of 'div'?

[17:24] <tbrowder> i looked at doc 'traps' but didn't see anything...

[17:25] *** pmurias left
[17:26] <tbrowder> i was porting C++ code and i think i recall tha C++ overloads the '/' operator to do the same as our 'div' (at least my tests imply that).

[17:29] <japhb> tbrowder: I wouldn't want that warning by default, because I often want the Rat path for that.

[17:30] <tbrowder> good point! and the Rats are a big plus for our cool Raku!

[17:30] <tbrowder> a compiler flag might be the answer

[17:31] <japhb> leont: I use a combination of Request/Response and Server-Push paradigms with Cro in MUGS (https://github.com/Raku-MUGS).  I also use it at two layers: to serve client/server messaging using WebSocket, and to serve HTML/CSS as one of the available UI options.

[17:31] <tbrowder> i think it should be mentioned in doc 'traps'

[17:32] <japhb> tbrowder: Seems reasonable from the point of view of "people coming from other languages won't expect Doing The Right Thing By Default".  :-)

[17:33] <tbrowder> yep, and i am doing a lot of porting C++ at the moment...
