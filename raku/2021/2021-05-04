[00:05] <edds> here no sign up button)

[00:05] <edds> how it works?

[00:07] <japhb> .ask timotimo Can you merge https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/73 ?

[00:07] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to timotimo

[00:07] <japhb> edds: Sign up for what?

[00:16] <softmoth> japhb, thanks. What version of rakudo are you using?

[00:20] <japhb> softmoth: v2021.04-10-gbb069a99c

[00:21] <softmoth> OK, I've been on 2021.02.1, I may need to check the latest. I may need to adapt to CompUnit::Repository changes, or maybe I just need to ignore any Repository that is `not .can('read-dist')`

[00:22] <ugexe> yeah you shouldnt be using read-dist

[00:23] <softmoth> ugexe, OK. My goal is to list "resources" for a dist. I got the dist from .candidates()

[00:24] <ugexe> thats fine. what are you calling read-dist for?

[00:24] <softmoth> not just "resources" but any files

[00:24] <softmoth> It is a LazyDistribution

[00:24] <softmoth> and I can't get anything from it.

[00:24] <softmoth> IIRC

[00:25] <softmoth> m: (.read-dist()(.dist-id).raku.put with $*REPO.next-repo.candidates("rakudoc").head).<files>.keys

[00:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 877fdd775: OUTPUT: ¬´Type Slip does not support associative indexing.‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[00:27] <softmoth> :> $*REPO.next-repo.candidates("rakudoc").head

[00:27] <softmoth> CompUnit::Repository::Installation::LazyDistribution.new(dist-id => "988DBA7F826D57FAEEE3344CC021AB3A40D55432", read-dist => -> $_ { #`(Block|91308736) ... }, meta => ${:api(v1), :auth("github:Raku"), :checksum(Str), :source(Any), :ver(v0.2.3)}, prefix => IO::Path.new("/opt/raku/versions/moar-2021.02.1/install/share/perl6/site", :SPEC(IO::Spec::Unix), :CWD("/home/trs/g/raku/rakudoc")))

[00:27] <softmoth> I get that OK. But I don't know how to get to "files" and "resources" from there.

[00:27] <ugexe> say CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.repository-for-name("site").candidates("Zef").head.meta<resources>

[01:20] <japhb> edds: Oh, yeah, by default IRC allows anyone to use an unregistered nickname; you register in order to reserve a name as just-for-you.

[01:28] <sasha> what ist this

[01:29] <sasha> oh its india symbol

[01:31] <sasha> this languages called 'scripts'

[01:31] <sasha> why

[01:34] <japhb> sasha: In what context?  For example, in programming language use, a script is a (usually) small program.  In Unicode use, a script is a set of symbols used to write a language.

[01:34] <sasha> japhb oh), i mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari

[01:36] <japhb> Yeah, that's the Unicode/typographical meaning.

[01:37] <sasha> im not competent in this

[01:37] <japhb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system

[01:38] <sasha> i think this language absolytley beutiful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts

[01:39] <sasha> i saw it recentley in ytubecomment so cool

[01:41] <japhb> Yeah, there are some really beautiful scripts.  Humans, what can't they do, eh?  :-)

[01:46] <japhb> Those are broad classes of scripts, yes.

[01:46] <japhb> IRC predates matrix by literal decades.  :-)

[01:47] <sasha> it has stickers and reactions and quick reply

[15:08] <softmoth> Hi! I'm looking for more user testing on rakudoc, if anyone has a few minutes to try it and let me know how it works for you:  zef update; zef install rakudoc --verbose

[15:12] <ugexe> you can make zef update automatically with the --update flag

[15:12] <ugexe> zef install rakudoc --verbose --update

[15:12] <ugexe> at least i think that still works lol

[17:47] <softmoth> I plan to implement fetching docs directly from github (to avoid the heavy dependencies of the current Raku/doc distribution), too. Currently it's of limited use unless you explictly set "RAKUDOC=/path/to/doc/doc" in the environment.

[17:47] *** sno left
[17:49] <raydiak> we still have all the generation of svgs and html and everything packed into the same project as the actual docs?

[17:50] *** domidumont left
[17:52] <tbrowder> hi, looking for advice on new module naming

[17:52] *** sno joined
[17:53] <softmoth> raydiak, yes, I've not been part of any discussions on that, but I know it's been desired for a long time to split it out

[17:54] <softmoth> I assume there's some non-trivial work needed for some reason

[17:54] <tbrowder> the primary purpose of the module is to convert from the Gregorian calendar dates (as used by DateTime) to other calendars

[17:55] <tbrowder> i'm considering such names as MultiCalendar, DateTime::Calendars, ...

[17:55] <raydiak> softmoth: definitely seems like a gross failure of separation between code and data, I'm a bit shocked it didn't happen years ago

[17:57] <raydiak> tbrowder: I like DateTime::Calendars more between those two. though if it's only mainly for conversion and not other operations, also maybe DateTime::Convert or ::Converter or something along those lines

[17:57] <softmoth> tbrowder, maybe a less generic name would be helpful; many things might be a MultiCalendar or a Calendars, while your function is quite specific.

[17:58] *** sno left
[17:59] <softmoth> It's probably too cute but something like DateTime::Ex::Gregorian

[17:59] <softmoth> Just my first thought, I'm sure your choice will be fine.

[18:11] <raydiak> if the other calendars you support are regional/cultural not e.g. astronomical/academic, maybe DateTime::International? if we're talking about what season it is on Mars then maybe DateTime::Interplanetry, ::Interstellar, ::Intergalactic, ::Universal or ::Multiversal depending on the scope of the implementation :)

[20:47] <tbrowder> ref calendars again, jforget's modules are great, but more detailed than what mine will be. i'm using E.G. Richards' system which uses an arithmetic conversion to/from an artificial calendar to convert dates of y/m/d between 15 calendars. just for some raku fun!
