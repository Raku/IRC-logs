[00:01] <lizmat> Ecosystem::Archive is just code for maintaining https://github.com/lizmat/REA

[00:01] <El_Che> japhb: I think users without Internet have already a flow in process (it can be as simple as a tar)

[00:02] *** reportable6 left
[00:03] <lizmat> ok, I think I found the reason:

[00:03] <El_Che> japhb: my team is very security focussed and we look in detail what we pull (dockers images, software + shsum etc) but we don't close to the internet. THe running containers, in contrast, are heavily firewalled

[00:03] <lizmat> the script I was using to load the module, had a "use v6.*" in it

[00:03] <lizmat> without it, it doesn't re-precompile

[00:04] <lizmat> oops, wrong channel

[00:04] <El_Che> in the no-internet scenario, it sounds to me like star is used like a poor man's Carton (https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton)

[10:58] <tbrowder> ugexe: zef is not finding the new Geo::Location

[10:58] <tellable6> 2021-10-28T03:16:27Z #raku <melezhik> tbrowder can we change mybfio slogan to "Friendly Software Reviews Network" ? (on raku.org page)

[10:58] <tbrowder> uploaded to cpan yesterday

[11:05] <tbrowder> .tell ugexe ^^^

[11:05] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[11:05] <lizmat> tbrowder: zef installs it fine for me

[11:05] <lizmat> raku.land also shows it

[11:05] <lizmat> and it's in the archive now

[11:06] <tbrowder> hm, i see it in archive, maybe i need to upgrade zef...

[11:08] <lizmat> zef update

[11:10] <tbrowder> update? ok...

[11:11] <tbrowder> did that, no change. on two of my hosts zef is not seeing new version of Geo::Location

[11:12] <tbrowder> do i need to nuke some zef thing?

[11:12] <lizmat> zef uninstall Geo::Location / zef install Geo::Location ?

[11:14] <tbrowder> tried that, too, no help

[11:15] <tbrowder> bummer...

[11:15] <tbrowder> i'll try asking for the ver

[11:17] <tbrowder> that worked, weird!

[11:18] <tbrowder> i may inadvertently be the culprit: during dev i couldn't wait for cpan and zef installed from the repo.

[11:19] <tbrowder> but later i zef uninstalled it.

[11:19] <lizmat> ah, yes... that can confuse things, I know from experience :-)

[11:20] <tbrowder> gotcha

[12:16] <andinus> does .hyper/.race make difference when using it in `for` loop?

[12:17] <lizmat> personally, I like to use it with .map for clarity

[12:17] <lizmat> the syntax of hyper / race with for is a bit iffy, imo  :-)

[12:18] <andinus> ah, i could use map but the job  i'm doing is not really for .map

[12:18] <andinus> its takign inputs, generating images

[12:20] <andinus> ^ does this seem like a thing for .map? i havent map like this before

[12:21] <lizmat> well, anything that is a stream of data that you can process in parallel

[12:22] <lizmat> my %hash = @inputs.hyper.map: {  ....; key => value }

[12:22] <lizmat> is a common idiom

[12:27] <andinus> i see, makes sense, thanks!

[16:52] <melezhik> looks like this - https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/blob/main/docs/03-method-reference.md#new

[16:53] <melezhik> password?

[16:54] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/blob/main/docs/03-method-reference.md#password   

[16:54] <lizmat> yes, I'd think so, yes

[17:04] <lizmat> melezhik: I have no immediate idea

[17:04] *** xinming__ left
[17:04] <melezhik> sure, no rush

[17:04] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/a287c22ccb74cb5af87c7022bfefcefb#gistcomment-3949924

[17:04] <melezhik> this is how I run irc client via Raku

[17:05] <melezhik> btw the login/password works for me if I use web client 

[17:05] *** xinming__ joined
[17:06] <El_Che> lo

[17:07] <lizmat> melezhik: if you add a `say %*ENV<LIBERA_SASL_PASSWORD>` before that, does that say what you expect ?

[17:07] <melezhik> I am checking this right now, let me see

[17:07] <lizmat> alsoL if you want to test your bot, I've set up a #bottest channel for taht

[17:07] <lizmat> *that

[17:08] <melezhik> yeah, password is set and passed to the script

[17:08] <melezhik> thanks will use that one

[17:08] <melezhik> however I guess is taken place _before_ I join a channel, right?

[17:09] *** djerius left
[17:10] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe you're logged in already somehow with that username ?

[17:11] *** djerius joined
[17:12] <melezhik> no, in that case Libera gives you an error - nickname is already taken

[17:12] <melezhik> it's basically IP based restriction, requiring some IP address use SSAL authent

[17:12] <melezhik> authentication 

[17:13] <melezhik> https://libera.chat/guides/sasl#sasl-access-only-ip-ranges

[17:13] <lizmat> hmmm.. but the web client, would also work on your IP ?

[17:13] <melezhik> I am by the way not required to authenticate at all when run irc bot from MY laptop (it has different IP)

[17:14] <melezhik> but this is the case when I run irc bot from mybf.io host 

[17:14] <melezhik> which has another IP

[17:14] <lizmat> melezhik: the only thing I can say at this point, is to make an issue for it

[17:14] <melezhik> and yeah basically my web client (browser) has the same *white listed* IP as my laptop

[17:14] <lizmat> maybe other people will immediately recognize with the problem is]

[17:15] <melezhik> so issue for who?

[17:15] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm not completely "at home" in the IRC::Client codebase

[23:48] <nahstra> How do I keep chaining when I need to remove a value? .splice ruins my chain :(

[23:50] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4 5>;  (@a.splice(2,3, <7 8 9>), @a).head.say

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar ab02205ed: OUTPUT: «[3 4 5]␤»

[23:51] <nahstra> danke

[23:51] <[Coke]> that's not right. :)

[23:52] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4 5>;  (@a.splice(2,3, <7 8 9>) && @a).head.say

[23:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar ab02205ed: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[23:52] <[Coke]> That works I feel it might not be nuanced enough.

[23:52] <[Coke]> (like maybe I made a mistake but it still worked.)

[23:53] <[Coke]> but, basically, since splice returns what you deleted, you need to force the part of the chain to pass along the array itself, not the result of the splice.

[23:55] <nahstra> right with the && 

[23:56] <[Coke]> honestly I'm surprised that worked. :)

[23:57] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4 5>;  dd (@a.splice(2,3, <7 8 9>) && @a)

[23:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar ab02205ed: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [IntStr.new(1, "1"), IntStr.new(2, "2"), IntStr.new(7, "7"), IntStr.new(8, "8"), IntStr.new(9, "9")]␤»

[23:57] <[Coke]> Yah, it seems to be doing the right thing.

[23:59] <nahstra> I should prob just split it up over a couple lines anyways '=D  just started learning an hour ago, raku is fun (y) 

[23:59] <[Coke]> Agreed!
