[04:05] <xinming> in a scrpit, when we do       rule xxx { }   I get error which is undeclared name xxx used at...
[04:06] <xinming> m: rule ccc { \d+ };
[04:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar ba15173fd: OUTPUT: «Potential difficulties:␤    Useless declaration of a has-scoped method in mainline (did you mean 'my rule ccc'?)␤    at <tmp>:1␤    ------> 3rule 7⏏5ccc { \d+ };␤»
[04:06] <xinming> m: my rule ccc { \d+ };
[04:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar ba15173fd: ( no output )
[04:06] <xinming> So, the rule/token declarator are forced to have my, am I right?
[04:07] <xinming> I thought rule/token/regex are all subs, which means should be the same as sub
[04:27] <codesections> m: say (rule {foo}).^mro
[04:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar ba15173fd: OUTPUT: «((Regex) (Method) (Routine) (Block) (Code) (Any) (Mu))␤»
[04:28] <codesections> they're actually Methods
[04:28] <codesections> (so, a type of Routine (like Subs), but with a different default declarator and a few other differences)
[04:42] <xinming> thanks, got it.

[15:33] <jdv> curious why a bunch of stuff is being removed from non-zef ecos.  isn't it a good shake out that they can co-exist just fine?
[15:34] <lizmat> but these were identical
[15:34] <lizmat> the old ecosystem URL pointed to the META6.json of the zef version
[15:34] <jdv> is that a problem?
[15:35] <jdv> i would have thought the overall design would be fine with that
[15:35] <lizmat> well, the zef ecosystem is the first to force compliance of the auth string
[15:35] <lizmat> cpan and the old ecosystem do not
[15:36] <lizmat> so, the auth strings inside the META cannot be trusted on CPAN en the old ecosystem
[15:36] <lizmat> so sites like raku.land and modules.raku.org apply their own logic to create an auth value
[15:36] <jdv> yeah but doesn't zef prefer fez or whatever so that's a lesser issue?
[15:36] <lizmat> which ignores what is in the meta
[15:37] <lizmat> it creates duplicates on sites like raku.land
[15:37] <jdv> oh
[15:37] <lizmat> and it creates the illusion of having multiple versions of a module, when there really aren't any
[15:38] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm working on a "backpan" for the raku ecosystem
[15:38] <lizmat> and getting the auth right is important for that :-)
[15:40] <Altai-man> .tell Kaiepi could you please when it's comfortable bump versions for your modules which were fixed for new-disp, otherwise the "fix" merged is not visible? The modules are: Data::Record, Trait::Traced, Kind::Subset::Parametric.
[15:40] <tellable6> Altai-man, I'll pass your message to Kaiepi
[15:41] <tbrowder> ref fez: is the code for the fez server setup open for public view?
[15:42] <tbrowder> i'm really interested in the email and dialog handling
[15:42] <jdv> last i heard it was not
[15:46] <tbrowder> btw, my simple shot at module Raku::Lint is on pre-publishing display at https://github.com/tbrowder/Raku-Lint. suggestions welcome
[15:47] <tonyo> tbrowder: it uses mailgun, what do you mean by dialog handling?
[15:49] <tbrowder> the prompts during registration, etc.
[15:50] <tbrowder> it could be cgi i guess
[15:51] <tonyo> ah, the prompts all happen on the client side and get sent as one bulk request to the server
[15:51] *** clarjon1 left
[15:51] <tonyo> that code is for review in the fez repo
[15:51] <tonyo> as well as how the password prompt works
[16:23] <tbrowder> tonyo: thnx!
[16:32] <lizmat> none of your zef:tony-o modules disappeared from the ecosystem afaics
[16:34] <tonyo> on p6c?
[16:34] <tonyo> i haven't removed them yet
