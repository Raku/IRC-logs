[00:44] <timo> wait, no, i misunderstood the question

[00:46] <mfiano> I am trying to figure out how a beginner to both Raku and FreeBSD should install rakudo. The website says "pkgsrc provides rakudo packages for NetBSD and other Unix flavors.", but pkgsrc is only for NetBSD. FreshPorts is for FreeBSD, but I see no rakudo package there. I'm unsure how I should install a stable release.

[00:47] <timo> in that case it should be fine to download release source tarballs for moarvm, nqp, and rakudo

[00:47] <timo> all you need to do is ass the same --prefix= to all three's Configure.pl scripts and make + make install in the order moar, nqp, rakudo

[00:48] <mfiano> Ok I will try that. I think maybe the download section of the website should be reworded though. This was misleading to me, as I thought pkgsrc applied to FreeBSD as it said until I researched further

[00:50] <timo> sorry i don't know anything about the BSDs, but if you can provide a patch for the website that'd be helpful

[00:51] <mfiano> I don't know much myself. I am migrating today from 25 years of Linux :)

[00:54] <mfiano> I am also curious what the benefit of Rakudo Star is. Seems like it just bundles documentation and a bunch of modules together. Not sure what that buys me over just installing modules I need to use.

[00:57] <perryprog> I think it's just a convenience/distribution thing.

[00:57] <perryprog> Great for lazy people like me.

[00:58] <mfiano> Ok thanks
