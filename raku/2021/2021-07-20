[10:52] <lizmat> mykhal: it was a pointer, and it was semantically reasonable: "at that point the parser threw up"  :-)

[10:59] <mykhal> lizmat: i was thinking that. initially thought about graphical similarity only, after i found rcgye acronym (e as in eject) in rakudo code :)

[13:13] <lizmat> let's see how fast that shows up  :-)

[13:18] <perlbot> Altreus: U+23CF (e2 8f 8f): EJECT SYMBOL [‚èè] 

[13:18] <Altreus> :)

[13:18] <Altreus> First time I saw that used in an error I thought, yep, that makes sense

[13:19] <Altreus> I was pleased that finally a language was using the symbols available

[13:25] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[13:50] <[Coke]> is there a way with HTTP::UserAgent to automatically retry, maybe on a timer?

[14:25] <jdv> [Coke]: sounds fancy

[14:37] *** archenoth joined
[14:45] <Juerd> A generic retry function would be useful to have too

[14:46] <Juerd> I've recently used the command line tool "retry", combined with "timeout", to retrieve some files with "scp" during a ddos

[14:46] <Juerd> After a few minutes it actually worked :)

[14:47] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[14:48] <Altreus> yes not a bad idea. in fact the try/catch form of exception handling (albeit somewhat refactored by raku) supports retry, conceptually at least

[15:44] *** justsomeguy joined
[15:51] <jdv> iirc stuff like that is on the cro ua roadmap

[15:52] <jdv> right now its a bit suboptimal i guess
