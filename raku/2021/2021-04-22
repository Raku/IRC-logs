[11:46] <lizmat> PSA: LizBot is an experimental logger by yours truly

[11:46] <lizmat> atm, it just logs

[11:49] <tyil> cute

[11:55] <lizmat> I want to make sure it produces logs identical to the colabti logs

[11:55] <lizmat> so we can have one location to study the history of Raku

[11:56] <lizmat> using historic logs from colabti and current logs from a dedicated Raku community logger

[12:01] <lizmat> hoping to create a mapping from all mentions if conversations on IRC in the core source and roast, into a stable logs.raku.org URL

[12:01] <lizmat> *of

[12:06] <patrickb> could that be irclogs.raku.org instead? Would be a bit more future safe...

[12:09] <lizmat> sure, I'm just working on getting the functionality together

[12:09] <lizmat> what the server name will be, who knows  :-)

[12:10] <lizmat> definitely bikesheddable

[19:39] <Xliff> Any europeans still around?

[19:40] <Xliff> Can you tell me why I am getting this error: Type check failed in binding to parameter 'O'; expected Any but got Evolution::Raw::Structs::EPhotoDataInlined (Evolution::Raw::Stru...)

[19:40] <Xliff> This code was previously working, the only difference was an addition of a BEGIN to the start of the line,.

[19:42] <lizmat> maybe you're referring to something that has not been initialized at BEGIN time yet?

[19:42] <lizmat> m: my $a = "foo"; BEGIN say $a eq "foo"

[19:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar c05b23f18: OUTPUT: «Use of uninitialized value $a of type Any in string context.␤Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.␤False␤  in code  at <tmp> line 1␤»

[19:42] <lizmat> something like that? ^^

[19:44] <Xliff> Use of the code in question is illustrated here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-EDS/blob/BeginBuildAccessors/lib/Evolution/Raw/Structs.pm6#L1385

[19:45] <Xliff> lizmat: Ah! So the class hasn't been defined, yet?

[19:45] <lizmat> possibly, I don't see it ?

[19:45] <lizmat> where should BuildAccessors be coming from ?

[19:48] <Xliff> It's defined in another project.

[19:48] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GLib/blob/master/lib/GLib/Raw/Subs.pm6#L291

[19:49] <lizmat> ok, so the sub should be available, as you're using GLib::Raw::Subs

[19:49] <Xliff> Ah! Waiting until the end and runnind it ghem seems to sort it.

[19:49] *** wamba left
[19:50] <Xliff> Yup! That sorts it!

[19:51] <lizmat> no sure what did, but glad to have been rubberducking  :-)

[22:20] <Xliff> Still wondering if it might be a nice idea to load up Raku bytecode in a database and have an app server execute the stored data rather than what's on disk.
