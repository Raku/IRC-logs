[00:02] <raydiak> ah, the repl...I didn't try that. I see your same error now, but only if I call it from a separate line. if you define and call it all on the same line with a ; in between, it works. don't know why off the top of my head

[00:07] <raydiak> I wonder if overloaded operators don't work in the repl for some reason

[00:11] <raydiak> reported, but it has received no attention so far: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3774 . all I can suggest, if you aren't up to pursuing a fix yourself, is adding a comment to that issue along the lines of "I also tripped over this bug when trying to run the rosettacode factorial example", hope it brings a little more attention to it

[08:50] <japhb> CBOR::Simple and Cro::CBOR updated with performance improvements, and TinyFloats with support for another 16-bit float format (bfloat16, originally defined by Google Brain and now used elsewhere also).

[08:56] <japhb> Challenge to those looking for a puzzle: Find data structures for which CBOR::Simple performs noticeably worse than JSON::Fast on any of the following measures: encode speed, decode speed, encoded size, round-trip fidelity, handling of all input types.  I want to add those cases to https://github.com/japhb/CBOR-Simple/blob/main/tools/perf-test so I have good targets for further tuning work.
