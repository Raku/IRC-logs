[09:21] <khatar> hello people

[09:22] *** khatar is now known as Od1n

[09:23] <Od1n> <<. raku|xxd -i

[09:23] <Od1n> print "{'A' x 2}\x80\x50\x0e\x08"

[09:23] <evalable6> Od1n, rakudo-moar 6d529046e: OUTPUT: ¬´AA‚ê¶P‚êé‚êà¬ª

[09:25] <Od1n> when doing so, i have an extra \xc2 after 'AA'. raku command doesn't seems to have a binary flag so i wonder what is the shorest way to just write bytes to $*OUT

[10:11] *** linkable6 joined
[10:23] <CIAvash> Od1n: I'm not sure what is supposed to happen, but you can write binary like this: `$*OUT.write: blob8.new: 65, 65, 80, 50, 14, 8`

[10:24] *** lichtkind joined
[10:37] *** solitario left
[10:43] <Od1n> CIAvash: thanks! definitely works.

[10:43] <Od1n> any idea to get this shorter? raku -e '$*OUT.write: blob8.new: ("A" x 400).comb>>.ord'

[10:44] <Od1n> "A".comb just to get 'the byte 'A' is probably overkill

[10:45] <lizmat> "A".ord xx 400 

[10:45] <lizmat> ?

[10:52] <Od1n> *that* simple! thank you lizmat

[11:07] <keutoi> CIAvash: Thank you

[11:26] <keutoi> repo-chain is not documented in CompUnit::Repository where it is defined. Is this deliberate?

[11:32] <lizmat> keutoi: not sure, actually, ugexe nine  might know

[11:50] <keutoi> lizmat: Since unstable API's might not be documented, is there a way to differentiate b/w unstable API and undocumented API?

[11:51] <lizmat> well, if a method is marked with the "is implementation-detail" trait, then you're sure that you have an unstable API

[11:53] <keutoi> Then is it acceptable to create the documentation(in raku) for methods that do not have this trait(in rakudo)?

[11:53] <lizmat> m: dd CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem.can("repo-chain")   # looks like repo-chain isn't marked as such

[11:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2bc49945: OUTPUT: ¬´(method repo-chain (CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem: *%_) { #`(Method|62853008) ... },)‚ê§¬ª

[11:53] <lizmat> keutoi: ideally yes

[11:54] <lizmat> thing is, that area of Raku is still a bit handwavy

[11:54] <lizmat> so, when there is a PR for a documentation fix, it might mean that people suddenly realize something should be marked as "implementation-detail"

[11:55] <lizmat> keutoi: but if you would like to put in the work on that, it *will* be appreciated and may wind up as internals documentation anyway  :-)

[11:56] <keutoi> So It is better to report it. It either ends up updated as implementaion-detail or the documentation gets added.

[11:56] <keutoi> lizmat: Thank you

[19:29] <El_Che> new rakudo?

[19:29] <El_Che> that means new rakudo-pkgs

[19:42] <moon-child> casaca: 'has $.secret where Str|Blob; # required' can be 'has $.secret is required where Str|Blob'

[19:43] *** mattil left
[19:44] <moon-child> casaca: use of ternary in OTP.rakumod seems weird.  I definitely would either turn that into a straight if/else or factor out the 'current-time ='.  But you can also do $current-time = $!posix-time || now.to-posix.head.Int - T0

[19:46] <moon-child> casaca: Generate.rakumod: '$secret = $secret.encode('ascii')' can be '$secret .= encode('ascii')'
