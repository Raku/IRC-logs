[05:11] <ToddAndMargo> Figured it out.  It is $*CWD

[09:30] <Geth> ¦ doc: tbrowder self-assigned Need a tutorial for Linux users wanting to use Raku on Windows https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3913

[10:01] *** tamarro joined
[10:06] <tamarro> why in Raku the logic behind the "current working directory" is duplicated and abstracted from the real meaning? Isn't this a flaw?

[10:06] <gfldex> tamarro: we don't call fork anymore. So we have to provide the ENV ourself.

[10:08] <tamarro> gfldex: this looks very confusing to me https://pastebin.com/LANJJRa9

[10:09] <tamarro> I wonder if Java does that

[10:09] <tamarro> probably not

[10:10] <tamarro> ok, checked, java does not support chdir

[10:11] <tamarro> Ruby raises a warning if chdir is called with multiple threads

[10:12] <tamarro> I think the logic behind Raku approach is sane, just another case of DIHWIDI

[10:13] <tamarro> action at a distance is never cool

[10:19] <tamarro> m: use NativeCall; sub execve(Str, int32, int32) is native { * }; sub fork(--> int32) is native { * }; execve("/bin/ls", 0, 0) if fork(); say "here"

[10:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ecc8308f: OUTPUT: «(signal ABRT)here␤A NULL argv[0] was passed through an exec system call.␤»

[10:19] <tamarro> works on macos

[10:20] <lizmat> In Raku each thread has its own "current directory" in $*CWD

[10:21] <tamarro> thanks lizmat, I figured out, makes sense

[10:21] <tamarro> basically the unix semantic doesn't play well with multithreaded programs. We knew that

[10:21] <tamarro> so either you do like java and you disable chdir

[10:22] <tamarro> or you do like Raku and you introduce the concept of dynamic variables

[10:30] *** Sgeo left
[10:32] <tamarro> multithreading is a concept loaded with many different meaning.. If I understand correctly in Raku this is mostly the Rx-model.. I wonder if multiprocessing really had inherent handicaps to handle this model

[10:33] <tamarro> well.. perl is quite poor in the area so probably, yes

[10:35] <lizmat> tamarro: what do you understand by "the Rx -model" ?

[10:36] <tamarro> react ,Channels , Promises, Supplies

[10:36] <lizmat> ah...I guess that's a yes then  :-)

[10:37] *** samebchase joined
[10:38] <tamarro> I find it funny that all this somehow coincide to unix IPC primitives. But somehow there is not a single high level language that uses them to the full power

[10:39] <lizmat> how would you rate Raku in that respect ?

[10:39] <tamarro> I love it

[11:00] <dpk> i'm moderately surprised that it complains about the recursive definition first, rather than the unterminated string literal
