[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> What is the easiest way to test that an object is a list or array of functions/callables?

[14:35] <moritz_> m: say (&[+], &map) ~~ all(Callable)

[14:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e457595a: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[14:35] <moritz_> hm

[14:36] <moritz_> m: say all(&[+], &map) ~~ Callable

[14:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e457595a: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[14:36] <moritz_> better :D

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Thank you!

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> The solution above seems obvious after seeing it. Because of the Monterey-Raku problems, in the last 6 weeks I have been programming too much in Python -- not Raku -- so, I have some sort of mild Pythonitis...

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> lol

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is that like?

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @Nemokosch#9980 Ah... much easier to find answers to questions than Raku. The problem is that sometimes there are too many answers for a particular question, and many of those answers are not that good or applicable. Also, at least once or twice I read, (mis-)understood, and tried to apply a Python 2 solution to som of my Python 3 problems.

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Another, more important point is that there are lots of "functionalities" implemented in Python -- in Raku too many things I have to do from scratch. (For the things I am interested in.)

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there are more libs I guess

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> on language level, I would be lowkey surprised if there were significant features in Python that Raku misses, I've never had that experience

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and I've used Python way more

[15:05] *** monkey_ joined
[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Agreed, on "language level" Raku is better. (That is why I invest time in it.)

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @Nemokosch#9980 Have you used Python for scientific computations? And/or scientific visualizations?

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not really, no

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I plan to make a blog post that compares Mathematica, Python, R, and Raku on random data generation.
