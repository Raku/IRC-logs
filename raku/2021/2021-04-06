[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: 

[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: `Type/Independent-routines` contains a reference to `Proc#sub_run` but `Type/Proc` does not contain any target for `run`.

[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: 

[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: So I have inserted a X<> around the first explanation of `run` in Proc. This provides a target for Independent-routines (also opening separate PR with new target)

[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: 

[05:31] <Geth> ¦ doc: BUT, for consistency, `run` should be listed as sub along with `new` and `shell`. Also relationship with new should be illustrated. This is not done in this PR.

[16:04] <samebchase-> Assume I have a Supply where events are being sent. Now, if there is more than say 2 seconds between events, then we have to trigger a timeout.  The thing is, I want this to run in a loop indefinitely. What's the best way of modeling such situations?

[16:05] <samebchase-> Ideally, I would need something like Promise.anyof, but for two supplies, one is the event supply, and the other is a timeout supply. If an event comes before the 2 second timeout, I want that timeout message to be discarded, and start the timer again, so to speak

[16:06] <samebchase-> In http://danboykis.com/posts/core-async-timeout-channels/ we see that the `alts!` function is being run on two separate channels, one is `c` and the other is a timeout channel. Basically, it's a race between two channels. Only one message is processed, the other is discarded.

[16:07] <samebchase-> In core.async that code can be run in a loop, and on each loop iteration it will run the race between both channels

[16:08] *** jcallen_ is now known as jcallen

[16:08] <samebchase-> The problem I am having with react/whenever is that I'm not finding a way to do a race between two supplies. BOTH messages are getting consumed. I want to discard some messages based on the result of the race. I hope I'm making sense.

[16:13] <samebchase-> I tried using https://modules.raku.org/dist/Supply::Timeout:cpan:CONO , but maybe I'm using it wrong

[16:18] <japhb> You've got a bit of an XY question going there.  I'm not sure if you're curious how to "race supplies", or how to determine that it's been 2 seconds between events.  One possible way of doing the latter is https://docs.raku.org/routine/stable .

[16:22] *** abraxxa left
[16:24] *** abraxxa joined
[16:24] <samebchase-> japhb: The XY question did strike my mind when I was asking this question. 😂 What I am trying to do is implementing the timeouts for Raft. I did use stable earlier, by doing a merge between the "events" supply and the "timeouts" supply. That did work, but it wasn't getting fired in the case where no events come in the "events" supply. stable()

[16:24] <samebchase-> was ensuring that I could do something every time there is X time elapsed between events, but in the case where there are no events at all, I still want a timeout to occur at that point 

[16:25] <samebchase-> With stable I was able to get half the problem sorted

[16:29] <japhb> Well it's hackish, but you could always arrange to send a dummy event down the event supply whenever stable fires.

[16:30] <samebchase-> japhb: yup I could do that! I was just wondering if there's a more elegant way to model these problems

[16:31] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[16:31] <samebchase-> A few days ago I stared at the documentation of stable(), and I just could not make sense of what it was trying to convey. I did the monkeys-on-a-typewriter thing, and something finally stuck. 

[16:32] <samebchase-> japhb: if you had to implement the timeout logic, what would you reach for? would you try and write your own version of some function like stable() which does what you want, or is there an easier way to do this

[16:34] *** wbiker left
[16:35] <samebchase-> Or it might be better if I hack up something based on stable(), and at least get it working how I need, and then refine it later.

[16:55] <japhb> The only time I've needed a similar kind of timeout functionality was in this code: https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/DecodedInput.pm6#L145 -- I used a stable timer (lines 146-148) that I would repeatedly silence by emitting a timestamp into it (lines 234-239), so if I ever failed to silence it in time, the timer would fire.

[20:24] <PlayPause9> I'm trying to use Comma but I don't know how to run any of the code I write. A little help?

[20:26] <PlayPause9> I made a new file. I don't know how to compile it though.

[20:28] *** __jrjsmrtn__ left
[20:31] <PlayPause9> kawaii Yeah, I tried that. It tells me "no such file or directory".

[20:31] <PlayPause9> You mean the terminal in Comma itself, don't you?

[20:32] <kawaii> no, I've never used that terminal, I mean a terminal cd'ed into the same location as your script

[20:32] <PlayPause9> Oh right.

[20:33] <kawaii> I would expect Comma's own terminal to be in the context of whatever file you're writing but who knows

[20:33] <PlayPause9> Yeah, Comma saved my file in a weird place. It's in some kind of hidden folder, ".config". I guess I could move the file somewhere more comfortable and try to compile it from there

[20:33] <PlayPause9> But then why is Comma saving my files in such a strange place?

[20:34] <PlayPause9> The project folder is in a nice, easy-to-spot place but the files aren't.

[20:34] *** __jrjsmrtn__ joined
[20:34] <PlayPause9> No, no, no, I think what I'm saying might be appear a bit confusing.

[20:35] <kawaii> did you make a "new project" in Comma or just open it and somehow make a file?

[20:35] <kawaii> https://i.imgur.com/fgg9lXq.png

[20:35] <kawaii> this is how mine looks

[20:35] <kawaii> I made a new project called 'test'

[20:35] <kawaii> and it chose a sensible location itself

[20:36] <PlayPause9> I made a Project called "ForTests" and I can see, in /home/myname/, a folder called "Comma Projects" and, in that folder, "ForTests". That's intuitive. Why the project files are kept within folders within the hidden .config folder is odd. 

[20:36] *** neshpion joined
[20:37] <PlayPause9> I believe I made a new project called "ForTests" however, I kept working with the "scratch.p6" file that was there when I first opened up Comma.

[20:37] <kawaii> Perhaps you misclicked something, my project files get saved in the project directory themselves - not a subdirectory or anywhere else

[20:38] <kawaii> Ah I think scratch files are something specific to Comma and not stored with your project, that is if you used the "create new scratch file" option PlayPause9 

[20:41] <PlayPause9> Oh okay, thank you kawaii

[20:41] <kawaii> https://i.imgur.com/X7mdHC4.png

[20:41] <kawaii> PlayPause9: if you choose Raku script/module from this menu, you'll probably get something in the actual directory itself

[20:46] <PlayPause9> You know, when I first installed Comma, I was having some issues with Raku. I had to do "rakudo" in the Linux terminal to compile Raku code. I couldn't just "raku". Do you think it's possible my installation of Comma is weird because of this?

[20:46] <PlayPause9> I'd like to uninstall and reinstall it but idk if that's necessary.

[20:46] <PlayPause9> Because yeah, Comma keeps saving files in a weird place.

[20:48] <[Coke]> I've never had that issue. I'd probably do a reinstall at this point if I were you, just in case.

[20:48] <PlayPause9> Yeah, alright. I'll do that in time.
