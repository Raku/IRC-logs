[14:35] <demostanis[m]> Is there any way I can have a variable inside a <-[ ]>?

[14:35] <demostanis[m]> I have `my $sep = ','` and I want to match anything but $sep...

[14:36] <moritz_> you can do that with [<!before $sep> .]

[14:37] <demostanis[m]> Isn't there a cleaner way?

[14:40] <MasterDuke> not without creating the regex "manually" with EVAL

[14:40] <MasterDuke> m: my $sep = "s"; my $r = "/(<-[$sep]>+)/".EVAL; say "foosbar" ~~ $r

[14:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82a9ca4fe: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢fooÔΩ£‚ê§ 0 => ÔΩ¢fooÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[14:41] <demostanis[m]> Didn't there use to be some MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL pragma?

[14:41] <demostanis[m]> Or is it not the same thing?

[14:42] <MasterDuke> m: my $sep = "s"; my $r = EVAL "/(<-[$sep]>+)/"; say "foosbar" ~~ $r

[14:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82a9ca4fe: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§EVAL is a very dangerous function!!! (use the MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL pragma‚ê§to override this error but only if you're VERY sure your data contains‚ê§no injection attacks).‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3sep = "‚Ä¶¬ª

[14:43] <demostanis[m]> What's the difference between EVAL and .EVAL?

[14:45] <MasterDuke> not a whole lot. i think TimToady isn't/wasn't a fan of the method form because it gets around the pragma, but it's in the spec so can't easily be removed

[14:48] <demostanis[m]> Why does Raku hang if I forget the dot after <!before $sep>?

[14:54] <MasterDuke> i assume you have some quantifier on it? it's a zero-width match, so it will keep backtracking and match on an infinite number of nothings

[14:55] <MasterDuke> (that explanation might not be using the technical words 100% correctly, but i believe the overall message is correct)

[19:10] <stanrifkin> What is the difference between .WHAT and .^name? And why is .WHAT not listed with .^methods?

[19:10] <tellable6> 2021-09-25T06:19:37Z #raku <holyghost> stanrifkin: use p6doc then, same thing AFAIK

[19:20] <SmokeMachine> stanrifkin: .WHAT returns the type itself, .^name returns the type's name as string

[19:25] <stanrifkin> My rakudoc version has no -r option. But the documentation says you can do rakudoc -r push for example. Is this still not implemented?

[19:25] <stanrifkin> SmokeMachine: thank you

[19:26] <stanrifkin> ah... ok no need for rakudoc -r push. Just rakudoc .push

[21:53] <superboot> Does anyone have the Comma Community download link for Linux? The page is down for me.

[21:54] <El_Che> https://commaide.com/download

[21:54] <lizmat> https://commaide.com/download/community/linux

[21:54] <lizmat> indeed gives me an empty page

[21:54] <El_Che> same

[21:54] <lizmat> I know they're working on a new release atm

[21:55] <lizmat> all download links are dead atm

[21:55] <El_Che> I have the plugin (not the standalone version) here, but I don't know if some one has a shsum to verify the file integrity

[21:56] <lizmat> I've pinged some people, pretty sure it will get resolved soon
