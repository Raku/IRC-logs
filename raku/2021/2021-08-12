[00:33] <raydiak> hard to say for sure without knowing what is in that array, but I'd guess you're getting a shallow copy of a container with immutable contents

[00:33] <raydiak> m: my @a = Map.new("foo" => Any),; for @a -> $i is copy { $i<foo> //= 1 };

[00:35] <raydiak> one way to fix it would be to just change $i to %i, so whatever it is gets contents copied into a mutable Hash

[00:35] <raydiak> m: my @a = Map.new("foo" => Any),; for @a -> %i is copy { %i<foo> //= 1 };

[09:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «0.039158687␤»

[09:58] <lizmat> frost: there's a number of issues at work here

[10:01] <lizmat> 1. is-prime internally keeps a list of the first N primes, where N is I believe at least 100_000

[10:02] <lizmat> so for the cases you're hypering over, the actual amount of work is minimal (as you can see in the time of the unhypered version)

[10:02] <lizmat> 2. hypering introduces overhead: threads need to be started, results must be cached until they can be produced in the right order, etc. etc.

[10:03] <lizmat> if the workload is very small, the overhead will drown the actual work being done

[10:03] <frost> lizmat Thanks, I'm just a little strange about the explanation in the document for introducing hyper.

[10:03] <frost> Yes, it does.

[10:04] <lizmat> 3. batch size is also important for getting a good balance between the overhead and amount of work

[10:05] <lizmat> compare:

[10:05] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^5_000_000 .map(*.is-prime); say now -INIT now;

[10:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.673786247␤»

[10:06] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^5_000_000 .hyper.map(*.is-prime); say now -INIT now;

[10:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «6.636019575␤»

[10:06] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^5_000_000 .hyper(batch=> 20000).map(*.is-prime); say now -INIT now;

[10:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.408956095␤»

[10:06] <frost> m: my @a = hyper for ^100_000_0 { $_**2  }; say now -INIT now;

[10:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.698961276␤»

[10:07] <frost> m: my @a = do for ^100_000_0 { $_**2  }; say now -INIT now;

[10:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «0.715294501␤»

[10:07] <lizmat> $_ ** 2 is still not a lot of work :-)

[10:07] <frost> But it is more fast !

[10:07] <frost> faster

[10:08] <frost> Oh, on my machine

[10:08] <frost> hyper is more faster

[10:09] <frost> Maybe I have less cores :)

[10:09] <lizmat> yeah, it's hardware dependent as well, depending on number of physical cores

[10:10] <lizmat> virtual cores don't help much if they're doing the same kind of operations at machine level

[10:20] <tbrowder> but maybe i can get docs without using the workaround doc site

[10:23] <tbrowder> speaking of docs, has anyone considered sphinx-doc.org as a possibility for some of our docs woes?

[10:24] <lizmat> tbrowder: I understand StarLink is starting operations soon, maybe that would be a solution for you?

[10:24] <tbrowder> we

[10:28] <lizmat> see also: https://www.starlink.com/faq

[10:28] <lizmat> even in the little villages around here, they are now very quickly installing fiber

[10:29] <lizmat> they realize that all those people will be using StarLink in a few years if they wouldn't have fiber

[10:29] <El_Che> I hope the cables are water resistent

[10:29] * El_Che ducks

[10:29] <lizmat> once they have fiber, they can be pretty sure they will remain customers, and not switch to something like StarLink

[10:30] <tbrowder> hm, interesting. i will be in an apartment for next few months so not much flexibility, but it may help at new house site. but fiber would be cool.

[10:30] <gfldex> lizmat: there is one tiny obstacle: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/08/att-delays-500000-fiber-to-the-home-builds-due-to-severe-fiber-shortage/

[10:33] <tbrowder> att is the "best" service in area we're moving to, and they have some fiber there, but for some reason they haven't expanded their area over the years.

[10:37] <lizmat> gfldex: well, but it is clear that these companies are suddenly in a hurry now  :-)

[10:38] <lizmat> tbrowder: I would suggest any core pod work to be done on the RakuAST branch ?

[10:38] <El_Che> Your Starlink will detect and melt snow that falls directly on it,

[10:38] <El_Che> it's time for a Skynet joke

[10:39] <tbrowder> lizmat, that sounds a little daunting, but a peek wouldn't hurt.

[10:39] <tbrowder> we don't worry about snow in florida ;-)

[10:40] <lizmat> El_Che: I think it just gets warm from the power it uses  :-)

[10:40] <El_Che> "all snow faces must die"

[10:40] <lizmat> *or* it gets its heat from the space laser on the StarLink satellites 

[10:41] <Altreus> that sounds related to the "but sometimes" episode of Technology Connections

[10:42] <tbrowder> is there any way to lock one's branch to rakuast on the git web interface for rakudo?

[10:44] <tbrowder> i guess i could fork it and control it on my copy...

[11:00] <tbrowder>  ok, that works

[11:38] <tbrowder> roger!

[11:40] <tbrowder> erg, i'm trying to checkout rakuast branch but git can't find it on my end. do i have to do something fancy like "git update-ref"?

[11:41] <tbrowder> i can see the branch name on github:rakudo/rakudo

[11:42] <lizmat> just doing a "git checkout rakuast" did it for me?

[11:43] <lizmat> if not, you will need to find someone with more git foo

[11:43] <tbrowder> i had an updated copy of the master branch so i must be missing a ref somehow

[11:44] <tbrowder> git foo is definitely missing on my end :-(

[11:44] <Altreus> it would be nice to join a corridor track again

[11:44] <El_Che> git pull first?

[11:45] <Altreus> do a fetch and then check git branch --remote

[11:45] <Altreus> in fact git branch --remote | grep rakuast

[11:45] <Altreus> if it's not there then the obviousest answer is you've got the wrong upstream

[11:52] <El_Che> git remote -v

[12:16] <tbrowder> going back to drawing board with tail between legs...

[12:16] <tbrowder> all hail Altreus

[12:17] <El_Che> a git subcmd: git whatwouldAltreusDo

[12:17] <MasterDuke58> lizmat: is-prime doesn't really keep any list at all. it's so fast to check that it doesn't make sense

[12:19] <lizmat> MasterDuke58: I thought the new implementation we use, had a bitmap or somesuch for the first N numbers being prime?

[12:19] <lizmat> guess I'm mistaken then  :-)

[12:20] <MasterDuke58> well, there is an if statement for the first 4 primes

[12:21] <MasterDuke58> there is a table kept https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L1520-L1533 but it's for doing the calculation, not of the primes themselves

[12:21] * MasterDuke58 doesn't really understand the math, just copy-pasted the code and it worked and called it a day

[13:06] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[13:08] <tbrowder> i remember same problem before, "git  help branch" does not show the "--remote". i think Altreus helped before and i filed a git bug. am i blind? does anyone see "--remote" in "git help branch"?

[13:11] <Altreus> looks like it is actually 'remotes'

[13:11] <Altreus> -r --remotes

[13:12] <Altreus> I'm guessing it either does unique starting strings, or has an undocumented alias

[13:15] <tbrowder> ok, now i see it, way down the page. the online git manual page shows it at the top in the summary, that's what keeps fooling me.

[13:15] <Altreus> tells you what it does when you know it's there, but doesn't tell you that it's there when you want something that does that

[13:17] <tbrowder> yepper

[13:17] <tbrowder> so, how about sphinx for raku docs?

[14:45] <raydiak> idk what that one ci failure is about, but it's clearly nothing to do with my changes

[14:48] <raydiak> heh it's so old now you can't even see the log. it was something early on in the build tooling, nothing to do with pod2text

[15:08] <vrurg> raydiak: I tried to initiate re-run for the failed check, but it resist me. Unfortunately, I'd rather not merge it because I barely familiar with Pod internals. 

[15:10] <vrurg> raydiak: I think the checks are too old for re-runs. You can do a minor commit to initiate new ones.

[15:11] <MasterDuke58> just force push a no-change commit

[15:13] <MasterDuke58> e.g., something like `git commit --reset-author && git push --force`

[15:18] <Altreus> rebase it :P

[15:21] <MasterDuke58> or yeah, just rebase up to master and then force push

[15:22] <[Coke]> (moving, fiber). I remember when this house got *cable* (not just internet over cable). any moves to a new house, we need fiber or a really good reason why not. :)

[21:32] <vrurg> Back up again. That was quick. :)

[21:33] <gfldex> doesnt work for me

[21:33] <[Coke]> I don't see a config.status in my nqp directory

[21:34] <[Coke]> (of course, I'm getting a failure atm)

[21:34] <gfldex> Looks like raku.org drops requests.

[21:38] <rba> server is running. seems to be that the connection to the webhosting server is getting down/up a few times.

[21:40] <melezhik> Hi all.

[21:40] <melezhik> I've added k8s checks to the Bird - https://github.com/melezhik/bird/blob/master/documentation/dsl.md#k8s-deployment-has-dplnamespacecntconfig

[21:40] <melezhik> if someone interested

[21:44] <vrurg> [Coke]: what kind of failures? Configure.pl only creates config.status on success, if memory serves me right.

[21:45] <[Coke]> doesn't matter, deleted my checkout and started over, no more failures.

[21:45] <[Coke]> (will report out on if there is a config.status or not.)

[21:45] <vrurg> rba: right, looks like it is flapping.

[21:45] <[Coke]> (looks like, yes)

[22:09] <[Coke]> is there a way to run a file as if it were a bat file without renaming it?

[22:25] <[Coke]> ah. I did not vote in the initial election.

[22:36] <moon-child> perhaps there should be a 'topic bot' that can schedule changes

[22:36] <moon-child> topical6?

[22:37] <moon-child> 'topicable' is more consistent but sounds more awkward
