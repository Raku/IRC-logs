[11:38] <tbrowder> happy day-after-christmas rakuuns

[11:39] <tbrowder> i need help with translating a perl thingy into raku: Storable's dclone

[11:42] <tbrowder> i think i understand that it somehow serializes an object into a file on disk, but i don't understand how that file is found by the next object...

[11:42] <tbrowder> but maybe a eureka moment! use a class attribute!

[11:44] <tbrowder> thanks to my munging a doc change, i discovered class attributes that apply to all instances of a class--i think that's my ticket for dcloning

[11:46] <tbrowder> stay well...

[11:56] <lizmat> tbrowder++

[12:04] <holyghost> merry christmass, tbrowder 

[12:04] <moon-child> I want to automatically rebind a dynamic variable on every newly created thread.  Is there a good way of doing that?

[12:05] <moon-child> in particular: I want to make http requests concurrently using 'race', but to share client state.  The client seems not to be threadsafe.  Obviously it would be wasteful to recreate the client for _every_ raced element, when the batch size is not 1

[12:05] <holyghost> In UNIX, shm

[12:06] <tbrowder> holyghost: merry christmas!

[12:06] <tbrowder> lizmat: merry christmas!

[12:06] <tbrowder> moon-child: merry christmas

[12:07] * lizmat is still adjusting to her new 5G capabilities

[12:07] <holyghost> lol

[12:07] <moon-child> tbrowder: eh, so I'm not good enough for an exclamation point? :)

[12:07] <tbrowder> sorry,

[12:08] <tbrowder> moon-child: merry christmas!

[12:08] <tbrowder> 5g, haven't

[12:08] <holyghost> Sorry to ask, liz but 3G capabilities ?

[12:09] <tbrowder> i heard that there might be some radiation issues with it?

[12:09] <lizmat> holyghost: /me got boostered yesterday: had 4G before  :-)

[12:09] <holyghost> ach

[12:09] <holyghost> What you want, dear :-) lol

[12:11] <holyghost> I thought you were working on 3G in raku (a package for example)

[12:12] *** linkable6 joined
[12:13] <holyghost> Damn, it would be a nice project, I like asterisk for example

[12:13] * holyghost ponders

[12:14] <holyghost> Problem is, it's huge

[12:14] <holyghost> So nm for me, except for a start

[12:18] <moon-child> lizmat: typo 'The tools that “new-disp” have made available'  have->has

[12:24] <holyghost> I'm somewhat working in ruby these days : made 2 projects : http://sf.net/projects/ruby-nes-joker and https://sf.net/projects/rubywebcrawler

[12:24] <holyghost> feeding you the links

[12:25] <holyghost> They're not finished though

[12:28] <holyghost> I will transfer then to the raku language later on

[12:28] <holyghost> especially the web spider, the NES emulator is more stupid
