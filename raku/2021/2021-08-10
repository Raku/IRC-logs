[17:20] <tonyo_> lizmat: most of my group thought is how to handle the auth .. does the group name suddenly occupy a username: `raku-community` so auth is `zef:raku-community` or should the auth be whoever is uploading and there's something else in the meta handling _who_ the org is
[17:21] <tonyo_> guess that's what the `owner` field is for
[17:27] *** pjlsergeant left
[17:28] <lizmat> yeah, unless there's another owner, "raku-community" or "raku-community-modules" would be the owner
[17:28] <lizmat> and if there's another owner, it wouldn't be a raku-community-module
[17:29] <lizmat> now, on whoever is uploading: I don't think that's information that should be in the META
[17:29] <lizmat> who uploaded it, is more a later forensics question than a decision on which module you should load for a given URI ?
[17:31] <ugexe> just have usernames and orgs be the same similar to github
[17:32] <lizmat> would work for me... although it should be github.com/gitlab.com agnostic ?
[17:32] *** sena_kun left
[17:33] <ugexe> the auth shoudnt be something that changes much if ever, otherwise consumers will have be incentivized to not use them for e.g. `use Foo:auth<...>`
[17:35] *** pjlsergeant joined
[17:35] <lizmat> agree
[17:36] <tonyo_> it'll be specific to the eco - that was my feeling too .. `raku-community` would eat that username but that seems like nbd
[17:45] *** childlikempress is now known as moon-child
[17:46] <ugexe> yeah so really anything org related is pretty much separate from raku / meta6
[17:47] <ugexe> you can fill out some arbitrary owner/whatever field automatically but that wouldnt realistically be consumed by anything
[17:47] <tonyo_> yea. okay we're on the same page about it
[17:51] <Xliff> What does this error mean: Cannot call method 'package_at_key' on a null object
[17:51] <Xliff>   in method COERCE at /home/cbwood/Work/BizzellAppServer/app/lib/Bizzell/Inventory/Instance.pm6 ($WORK::Inventory::Instance) line 33
[17:51] <Xliff> The package in question is definitely not defined, according to a .gist
[17:52] <Xliff> This is in a method COERCE, btw.

[20:14] <[Coke]> It's unicode; getting that font right on windows is hard. One sec, will find the ticket #.
[20:15] <[Coke]> hurm. I cannot find the ticket I thought I opened.
[20:16] <[Coke]> It's "Rakudo" and "Raku"; you'd need to a) be using the right codepage on windows, and b) have a font that can render those characters.
[20:17] <[Coke]> I think the plan is to make that ASCII if we're on windows. for now, it's cosmetic (but does indicate you might want to enable unicode in your shell)
[20:17] <[Coke]> ah, it was closed: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4379
[20:18] <[Coke]> read through that; it was closed in Jun, so I would have expected the fix to work in the .07 release
[20:27] <aixylinux> Thanks for the quick response.  The REPL displays correctly. chcp says codepage is 437.  What ought it to be?
[20:31] <[Coke]> says in the ticket.
[20:31] <[Coke]> (I always have to look it up)
[20:32] <aixylinux> The ticket says chcp 65001.  That produces different garbage.
[20:32] <[Coke]> m: say chr(0x00Df) ; # will probably make this work.
[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10b016ccf: OUTPUT: «ß␤»
[20:32] <[Coke]> Yes.
[20:33] <aixylinux> C:\Users\danhale>chcp 65001
[20:33] <aixylinux> Active code page: 65001
[20:33] <[Coke]> which is the behavior I reported before lizmat closed the ticket.

[20:33] <aixylinux> Welcome to 𝐑𝐚𝐤𝐮𝐝𝐨™ v2021.07.
[20:33] <aixylinux> Implementing the 𝐑𝐚𝐤𝐮™ programming language v6.d.
[20:33] <aixylinux> Built on MoarVM version 2021.07.
[20:33] <[Coke]> That's rendering ok here.
[20:33] <[Coke]> is that a cut and paste?
[20:33] <aixylinux> I see here the copy/paste displays correctly.  Thanks anyway, if it's a known issue, I can wait for a fix.
[20:33] <[Coke]> (with it looking bad on your screen?)
[20:34] <aixylinux> no it looks good in this window.  (Chrome browser)
[20:34] <[Coke]> I think the fix is "don't try to use that unicode on windows.". I think part of the issue is that windows unicode-aware fonts do not cover that character range.
[20:35] <aixylinux> Ah so desu ka.  Thanks for your help.
[20:35] <[Coke]> yup, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5e1c97bae6 seems to show it using ASCII if we detect we're on windows.
[20:36] <[Coke]> Hai.
