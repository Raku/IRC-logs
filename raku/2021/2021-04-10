[11:42] <adot> How can I get the moarVM bytecode for a program? I've tryed `raku --target=mbc -o f.bc -- hello.p6` but it gives

[11:42] <adot> ===SORRY!===

[11:42] <adot> Cannot dump this object; no dump method

[11:42] <adot> hello.p6 is `say "Hello World";`

[11:44] <MasterDuke> i think it might have to be --output, iirc the short form is broken

[11:45] <adot> Yep, that works, thanks

[11:45] <MasterDuke> np

[12:00] <no-n> I have a Perl 5 program and a Raku program that look the same but the Raku program waits for an extra keystroke. https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/6WSWVXHgyw/ and https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/mgQwDWpwNW/

[12:07] <timotimo> https://docs.raku.org/type/IO::Handle#routine_getc - this might help you

[12:07] <tellable6> hey timotimo, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/69e7f4fdb5f81ab3d52a6296feffdebc

[12:12] *** kurahaupo joined
[12:21] *** aborazmeh joined
[12:29] <adot> Follow up: I've compiled the program with `rakudo --target=mbc --output=hello.moarvm hello.p6`, and when I try to run it with `moar --libpath=/usr/local/Cellar/rakudo/2021.02.1/share/perl6/lib/Perl6 hello.moarvm` I get

[12:29] <adot> ```

[12:29] <adot> Unhandled exception: Cannot call method 'load_setting' on a null object

[12:29] <adot>    at <unknown>:1  (/usr/local/Cellar/rakudo/2021.02.1/share/perl6/lib/Perl6/ModuleLoader.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)

[12:29] <adot>  from <unknown>:1  (hello.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)

[12:29] <adot> ```

[12:29] <adot> How would I solve/go about debuging this.

[12:34] <ugexe> the short answer is you cant run your compiled code directly

[12:34] <ugexe> not yet anyway

[12:35] <ugexe> so if you want to debug that, first you need to implement it in moarvm so there is something to debug

[12:39] <ugexe> nothing really materialized out of that though

[12:42] <adot> `perl6` (the command line program) is now `rakudo`/`raku` (which are both the same), right?

[12:48] <adot> Is it ever possible to have `moar` (the cli) run bytecode then, or is it always an implemetation detail of `rakudo`

[14:21] <Marcool> Hi all, has there been any changes in v2021.03 as to handling of signatures in subs?

[14:22] <Marcool> Specifically I had a script that used:

[14:22] <Marcool> unit sub MAIN( Str :$quality where { $quality ∈ <lofi midfi hifi> } = "hifi", etc.); blabla

[14:22] <Marcool> that used to work

[14:22] <Marcool> and now that's throwing:

[14:22] <Marcool> Type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected Any but got Mu (Mu)

[14:22] <Marcool> and is fixed thus:
