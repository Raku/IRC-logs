[16:41] * nine started programming with Borland Pascal and by reading through "Borland Pascal 7.0 Das Buch"

[16:43] <vrurg> My first language was something nobody ever heard about. Certainly not outside of USSR, and even there it was a handful of people working with it.

[17:20] <tonyo> vrurg: what language?

[17:21] <vrurg> tonyo: it doesn't event have a name in latin alphabet. ЯМБ :D 

[17:23] <vrurg> Can be translated as A Language Of Accountant Machines

[17:26] <[Coke]> regarding jnthn's note about the spec test suite incidentally using features because they're convenient - might be nice to have a pass through the spec test suite to disentangle that sort of thing. (e.g don't use whatever-* if not needed)

[17:26] <lizmat> slightly -- on that: tests need to be easy to make

[17:26] <lizmat> this kind of refactoring is *fortunately* rare!

[17:31] <MasterDuke> that refactoring (of tests) might be easier to do in some sort of automated fashion after rakuast lands...

[17:33] <nine> Honestly sounds rather like useless busy work to me.

[17:42] <[Coke]> it's useless for rakudo, mostly; might be helpful for a new implementation

[17:42] <lizmat> jnthn surprises me  :-)

[17:42] <[Coke]> for $dayjob, sort of thing I'd put on the backlog but not prioritize until a business owner wanted to "pay" for it.

[17:42] <[Coke]> I'm behind, no spoilers!

[17:43] <[Coke]> (kidding, spoilers ok. :)

[18:35] <nine> tonyo: follow up on auth checking: so if fez does the auth checking but at the same time I can still upload to CPAN or GitHub using someone else's name in my META6.json, what do we really gain? Sounds like it would only really work when we migrate everything to fez and abandon the other ecosystems.

[18:36] <lizmat> well, that would be a good course of action, IMO

[18:38] *** Xliff left
[18:49] <japhb> I concur.  The only reason I haven't pushed for it is that the native fez support for mi6 wasn't merged last time I checked, and telling people to move away from CPAN when their tooling tries to push them onto CPAN seems destined for LTA.

[18:50] <japhb> (And I have only recently managed to get out from under a pile of unshaved yaks of my own.)

[18:54] *** Sgeo joined
[19:03] *** reportable6 joined
[19:19] <ugexe> nine: thats more a matter of what the default zef configuration is

[19:19] <ugexe> p6c and cpan can very well default to off and be turned on only with e.g. --cpan once some critical mass occurs

[19:20] <ugexe> although that i guess that mostly requires adbandoning the other ecosystems

[19:57] <vrurg> Perhaps smoother migration could happen if zef ignores other ecosystems if a module already exists in fez/zef?

[20:15] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/pull/400 this sort of does that... it allows grouping ecosystem plugins together in such a way that an earlier ecosystem with a lower version would be taken over a later ecosystem with a higher version
