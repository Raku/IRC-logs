[00:02] <raiph> SmokeMachine: I've written something in it. I don't see how to link to the site with my text in it. Surely there's a way?

[00:03] <SmokeMachine> I don't think there is... :(

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> raiph: but you can copy the text

[00:04] <raiph> throw bow n arrow through loopy hoop

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> throw	/Œ∏r…ô ä/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> bow	/ba ä/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> n	/…õn/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> arrow	/Àà√¶r…ô ä/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> through	/Œ∏ruÀê/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> loopy	/ÀàluÀêpi/ 

[00:05] <SmokeMachine> hoop	/huÀêp/

[00:06] <raiph> SmokeMachine: Do you hear a difference between grow and food? 

[00:07] <SmokeMachine> raiph: yes.. but I think the harder to me is `a` and `√¶`

[00:08] <raiph> ok, but the difference between throw and through, is the same as between so / mood, glow / brood, blow / rude 

[00:09] *** oneeggeach left
[00:10] <raiph> so for throw / through, and other word pairs with the same phonetics that you confuse, don't rely on phonetics

[00:10] <raiph> instead, try relying on tiny stories you make up, with rhyming

[14:36] <JJAtria[m]> ^ I guess this is because when using a role, the assignment is using the role, but when I read the variable I'm using the punned class, and those are treated as different

[14:37] <JJAtria[m]> Is there a way to get access to the pun without actually calling `new`?

[14:48] <JJAtria[m]> Well, .^pun does the trick üéâ

[21:47] <summerisle> it makes sense when you think about it. ruby's behaviour is similar

[21:48] <summerisle> where no attributes are truly private, just a little harder to mess with

[22:05] <tonyo> m: class A { has $!x = 42; }; say A.^attributes[0].get_value(A.new);

[22:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[22:06] <tonyo> m: class A { has $!x = 42; }; say A.^attributes.grep(*.name eq '$!x').first.get_value(A.new);

[22:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[22:07] <tonyo> pretty easy to bypass `privacy` 

[22:15] <guifa2> summerisle: yeah, I think it's just one of those things of remembering where to look for it

[22:16] <guifa2> but yay, this will make my code much cleaner now.  I was manually writing some lazy loading routines, that were all backed by the same data file ‚Äî¬†that's what I wanted in a private attribute but still available to the access method made a trait
