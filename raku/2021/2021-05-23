[00:56] <Xliff> Sometimes when I cast a CStruct to a CPointer, I get "This REPR cannot change type" (which makes no sense, this has to exist for NativeCall to even work!) -- is there a workaround?

[16:53] <tonyo> seems you already know what the issue is, though.

[21:03] <raydiak> Xliff: you need another proxy over data like you did with mime_type and inlined, and to run it under a modern raku instead of a 2 1/2 year old one. with the proxy it works for me on 2021.04

[21:11] <raydiak> if you really want to keep using these browser things for running raku, you might try glot.io. I haven't used it much personally, but it's well-known, supposed to be stable, and has sane URLs. and looks like their raku is only 3 months old

[21:13] <Xliff> ROFL. OK. 

[21:14] <Xliff> repl.it used to be the same, but they grew profitable and so ...

[21:14] <Xliff> Thanks for your glot.io suggestion. I will look inti it.
