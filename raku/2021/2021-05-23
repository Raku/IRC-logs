[00:56] <Xliff> Sometimes when I cast a CStruct to a CPointer, I get "This REPR cannot change type" (which makes no sense, this has to exist for NativeCall to even work!) -- is there a workaround?

[01:18] <raydiak> maybe I'm confused, but wouldn't you cast to Pointer, not CPointer?
[01:20] <raydiak> m: use NativeCall; class C is repr<CStruct> { has uint8 $.a; }; say nativecast Pointer, C.new

[01:29] <Xliff> raydiak: Yes. And for some reasons, if I do exactly what you did, I will get this message.
[01:29] <Xliff> It might have to do with the fact that the Struct in question came from C, not Raku.
[01:33] <raydiak> I don't think coming from C should cause it, but I could be wrong. without an example to analyze and play with, we can only blindly speculate

[01:54] <raydiak> the reasons I keep suggesting that you reduce your problem to a short example are: (A) you're much more likely to get help because it makes it easier to help you, (B) often in the process of cutting your big project down to a small example, you'll zero in on the problem yourself through bisection, and (C) if it's hard to reduce, it points to places where you ought to have cleaner separation between the
[01:54] <raydiak> different parts of your project
[02:03] *** Manifest0 left
[02:03] <raydiak> either way, hopefully someone with more nativecall experience will chime in here eventually and have a guess as to what you're doing wrong :)

[20:45] <raydiak> I'm mildly surprised that even parses with "HAS". That's not a thing, you need "has". that service is running rakudo 2018.12

[21:03] <raydiak> Xliff: you need another proxy over data like you did with mime_type and inlined, and to run it under a modern raku instead of a 2 1/2 year old one. with the proxy it works for me on 2021.04
[21:04] <Xliff> raydiak: Oh. You mean tio.run is using an older version? LOL! Thanks.
[21:05] <raydiak> yes quite old. you're welcome :)
[21:07] <Xliff> raydiak: Can you link your code?
[21:07] <Xliff> raydiak: When you making the move to libranet?
[21:09] <raydiak> https://gist.github.com/raydiak/cded4a7621e3fd5762fa6e8390023ffb
[21:09] <raydiak> I'm already there
[21:11] <raydiak> I just copied one of your proxies, changed the names in it, and made data private. no other changes besides the indents :)
[21:11] <tonyo> if only there was a way to shorten urls
[21:11] <Xliff> Heee!
[21:11] <Xliff> raydiak++
[21:11] <raydiak> if you really want to keep using these browser things for running raku, you might try glot.io. I haven't used it much personally, but it's well-known, supposed to be stable, and has sane URLs. and looks like their raku is only 3 months old
[21:13] <Xliff> ROFL. OK. 
[21:13] <tonyo> for one thing, that CUnion may or may not have an `inlined` variable
[21:14] <Xliff> repl.it used to be the same, but they grew profitable and so ...
[21:14] <Xliff> Thanks for your glot.io suggestion. I will look inti it.
[21:15] <raydiak> sure thing, happy to help
[21:19] <raydiak> I probably should have engaged that over here. saw it on freenode first, answered there. seems fixed by putting another Proxy over EPhotoDataInlined!data https://gist.github.com/raydiak/cded4a7621e3fd5762fa6e8390023ffb
[21:19] <raydiak> and running under a modern raku...tio.run is way back on 2018.12
