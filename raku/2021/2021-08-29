[00:25] <moon-child> is there any method like 'rest' where e.g. <1 2 3>.rest ←→ <2 3>?

[00:28] <rakuUser> <1 2 3>.tail(2) gives (2 3) idk if that is what you are looking for

[00:29] <moon-child> more .tail(*-1).  But that's not really better than [1..*-1]

[00:30] <rakuUser> .tail(*-1) is cool

[05:45] <CIAvash> moon-child: I don't think so, [reduce](https://docs.raku.org/routine/reduce) takes arguments as [Single argument rule slurpy](https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#Single_argument_rule_slurpy), and it makes sense.

[05:49] <CIAvash> Is there going to be a binary release for Rakudo 2021.08? cc Altai-man patrickb
