[08:56] <whatnext> Hi guys :)  So yesterday I was asking about this error while using Inline::Python: "Cannot find method 'EXISTS-KEY' on 'BOOTHash': no method cache and no .^find_method". I got disconnected before anyone answered. Does anyone know if there is any update on this? It seems to be a bit of a show-stopper for Inline::Python use?
[08:58] <lizmat> could you post a gist of the backtrace with the program running with --ll-exception ?
[08:58] <tellable6> 2021-11-03T22:33:01Z #raku <melezhik> lizmat - https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/issues/65
[09:07] <whatnext> lizmat: I posted a gist with --ll-exception output some time ago: https://gist.github.com/whatnext/87c22a266f05d6f799ab5d2b01b610d3 - however, to work around the problem we have been moving "use" statements around, eventually gets the code to compile. However, it's a pain, and also it seems the error can resurface after almost any change, and then
[09:07] <whatnext> you are back to moving "use" statements around. If we can't find a fix for it, I think we are going to have to work towards eliminating the dependency - which would be annoying since that was one reason for picking raku in the first place
[09:09] <lizmat> could you re-run with rakudo at master?  and post a gist of that?  
[09:10] <lizmat> 2 reasons: I've refactored the code at INDIRECT_NAME_LOOKUP a bit, so that it hopefully will be able to provide more information
[09:10] <lizmat> and 2. there've been a lot of fixes in the past weeks
[09:11] <lizmat> the line number in your current gist doesn't match, so that's how I know you're running not on the latest :-)
[09:14] <whatnext> so you think a fix might have gone in? Ok I will do that and get back to you :)
[09:17] <nine> whatnext: please try adding "no precompilation;" to the module that has a "use Inline::Python;"
[09:18] *** evalable6 joined
[09:23] <whatnext> nine: that doesn't seem to work unfortunately. I'll try building the latest version of rakudo and see if that helps (once I figure out how to do it!)

[17:04] <melezhik> throttling is enabled to prevent spam here, in case mybfi.io gets spam first )))
[17:04] <melezhik> let me know if you have any questions or issues ... thanks
[17:05] <lizmat> MyButterfliable: help
[17:05] <lizmat> melezhik: maybe let it respond to that ?
[17:05] <MyButterfliable> mybfio: teddy-bear has a new comment - https://mybf.io/project/teddy-bear/reviews#melezhik_1636045522
[17:05] <melezhik> interactivity is not yet implimented
[17:06] <melezhik> basically bot just send notifications when new comments/reviews arrive to any mybfio project 
[17:07] <melezhik> if someones sees that bot needs to answer some/any questions , please let me know - https://github.com/melezhik/mybfio
[17:08] <tonyo> how are these sorted melezhik ?
[17:08] <melezhik> lizmat it's doable . I just need to see what kind of help people need ))
[17:08] <melezhik> tonyo oh, it was quite a problem )) As the current IRC
[17:09] <melezhik> Irc::Client seems does not do SASL - https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/issues/65
[17:09] <melezhik> I ended up spinning ztc proxy on my digital ocean droplet
[17:09] <lizmat> melezhik: so how did you fix / work around it ?
[17:09] <lizmat> ah. ok, hack around...  
[17:10] <melezhik> so that raku code talks to ztc proxy 
[17:10] <melezhik> and this one in turn is capable to implement SASL thing 
[17:10] <melezhik> yes, it's  a hack, but looks like right now I don't have any better option 
[17:11] <melezhik> this is about authentication - https://github.com/lizmat/IRC-Client/blob/main/lib/IRC/Client.rakumod#L204-L206
[17:11] *** camelia left
[17:11] <melezhik> not about SASL
[17:11] *** nine left
[17:11] <melezhik> I used password/users btw to authenticate against my localhost ztc proxy 
[17:12] <melezhik> ztc -> znc
[17:12] <melezhik> https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC
[17:13] <melezhik> the problem with digital oceans IPs it that libera irc "does not like" them and enforce SASL authentication for them

[20:28] <lizmat> nice  :-)
[20:29] <melezhik> one can also use `@user` in any comment/reply and once a `@user` is logged they will see notification in dashboard
[20:29] <melezhik> I even thought to use GH logins in irc notifications, however IRC nicks NOT ALWAYS are the same as GH loginc

[21:00] <Skarsnik> Hello, is there a way to know when some code is run? like { say "code run at", $*PHASER} 
[21:00] <lizmat> perhaps Trait::Traced is what you're looking for ?
[21:01] <Skarsnik> Basicly I want to prevent a routine to be run at compile time
[21:02] <lizmat> set a variable at INIT time, and check that in the routine ?
[21:07] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a = 0; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; foo();
[21:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e5c17f1a: OUTPUT: «no no compile time␤  in sub foo at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»
[21:07] <Skarsnik> sad x)
[21:08] <Skarsnik> hm nvm
[21:12] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; foo();
[21:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )
[21:12] <Skarsnik> this work :)
[21:12] <Skarsnik> m: sub foo {my $a; INIT {$a = 1}; die "no no compile time" if $a == 0}; BEGIN foo();
[21:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: OUTPUT: «Use of uninitialized value of type Any in numeric context␤  in sub foo at <tmp> line 1␤5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤An exception occurred while evaluating a BEGIN␤at <tmp>:1␤Exception details:␤  no no compile time␤    i…»
[21:13] <Skarsnik> Not sure how to avoid the uninitilized
[21:14] <guifa> https://tio.run/##Pc/NCoJAFAXgvU9xkKBV0A@0sVqkUhK4ahPRYqwrDYyOjONC@nkWn8UXMx3T3b3fMIdzM1Ji3TR5ESGWEi8LQFJiEjHldPPePwShWbHF3JB79N3TQAtDQRicMdDSkB96GGllKGcl7IsswBSBp7DxrasNMSXK2V0mGRcEwTSNS/@kirTndthdu8SbiXtwgu3JdKpR5AT95HmXOnzWPCEbPP53aNvjXVdt349ltac6TfMD
[21:14] <Skarsnik> ok with ! defined it's better x)
[21:14] <guifa> Just add a BEGIN $a = 0;
[21:15] <lizmat> m: sub foo { BEGIN my $a = 1; INIT $a = 0; die if $a }; foo
[21:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )
[21:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )
[21:16] <lizmat> m: sub foo { BEGIN my $a = 1; INIT $a = 0; die if $a }; BEGIN foo

[21:17] <guifa> declaring in a phaser feels like that feels weird to me.  I mean, I know it works and why but still lol

[21:55] <helloworldflip> lizmat thanks!
[22:00] <melezhik> lizmat I don't mind to switch the channel, will people use #raku-news one?
[22:00] <lizmat> I don't know... but I think it would be nice to have a channel like #news on irc.perl.org
[22:01] <melezhik> yeah, I also like the ide
[22:01] <melezhik> idea
[22:01] <lizmat> to report on uploads of modules, comments from MyButterfliable , blog posts, messages by the RSC etc
[22:01] <melezhik> let's give it a try

[22:23] <Skarsnik> lizmat, the compile time hack does not work when inside a module x)
[22:24] <lizmat> huh?
[22:24] <lizmat> ah, of course, the BEGIN runs at precompilation
[22:24] <lizmat> so it would not set it
[22:25] <lizmat> m: sub a { my $running; INIT $running = True; die unless $running }; a
[22:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3ef09a72e: ( no output )

[22:25] <lizmat> Skarsnik: ^^  try that ?
[22:27] <Skarsnik> same
[22:27] *** archenoth left
[22:28] <lizmat> so your code in the module should not run at compile time of your script ?

[22:30] <Skarsnik> I am preventing something I am adding to NC to be called at compile time x)
[22:32] <lizmat> ah, the Lock eh?
[22:32] <lizmat> hmmm
[22:33] *** melezhik left
[22:34] <Skarsnik> is that a precomp bug? or INIT in a module is precompiled? (wot)
[22:34] *** archenoth joined
[22:36] <lizmat> no, the INIT should run always
[22:40] <Skarsnik> Actually BEGIN foo() make the INIT section of the sub to run
[22:40] *** melezhik joined
[22:42] <Skarsnik> [skarsnik@localhost perl6-gumbo]$ ../../rakudo-2021.09/install/bin/rakudo -I ~/rakudo/lib/ -I ./ -M Piko -e 'BEGIN foo();'
[22:42] <Skarsnik> Start Init defined : False
[22:42] <Skarsnik> End init defined : True
[22:43] <Skarsnik> I am actually confused x)
[22:43] <lizmat> hmmm... yes, starting to be as well
[22:45] <Skarsnik> (why I am always found weird stuff or bugs every time I do some Raku xD)
[22:46] *** helloworldflip left
[22:48] <lizmat> looks like the INIT of the module is running shortly after it has been used
[22:50] <lizmat> I guess we need a way to export an INIT block  :-(
[22:52] <Skarsnik> But it's a behavior bug or a documentation error ? x)
[22:52] <lizmat> well, the documentation is pretty vague
[22:53] <Skarsnik> Execution begins
[22:53] <Skarsnik>        INIT {...} #  at runtime, as soon as possible, only ever runs once 
[22:53] <Skarsnik> In a way it's the runtime of the compilation? xD
[22:54] <lizmat> and the end of yet another day comes for yours truly
[22:54] <lizmat> will sleep on it&
[22:54] <Skarsnik> time to sleep too ~~
