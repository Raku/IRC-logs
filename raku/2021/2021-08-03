[02:08] <thundergnat> <moon-child >: I wonder if there's some kind of precomputation you can do on a set of names (like some kind of hashing) that lets you quickly identify close levenshtein matches?

[02:08] <thundergnat> Not so much for Levenshtein, but Sorenson-Dice will do that readily and is probably better suited for partial name look-ups.

[02:08] <thundergnat> See this gist I just threw together: https://gist.github.com/thundergnat/87a0ab428bbc80a09cbe8acb9f8dd614

[02:10] <thundergnat> Shameless plug: I wrote the Text::Sorensen module. https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=Sorensen

[16:35] <moon-child> (which it would be cool to have a raku module that does)

[16:38] <Altreus> presumably \ is just $ except ... skipping a container?

[16:38] <Altreus> I'd expect $ not to bother making a container either unless there were an actual name there
