[02:31] <neshpion> how come `get` behaves differently in a heredoc using `raku <<-"EOF"\n<script>\nEOF` vs in a .raku file running as `raku script.raku` ?  https://termbin.com/z9sw

[03:06] <cj> hey folks

[03:06] <cj> is cromedome about?

[03:08] <cj> I have a 20-core 32-gig k8s system to offer for the CI integration bot

[03:08] <cj> or possibly Patrick Böker

[03:11] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Whats the difference between my/our/has?

[03:12] <cj> my and our are generally for scoping variables to a namespace

[03:12] <cj> has tells you whether a namespace has a symbol in it, I think

[03:12] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Uhhh…

[03:12] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Not sure what that mean

[03:13] <cj> my $foo = x; (within the current namespace, we create a variable called $foo and assign it a value)

[03:13] <cj> that $foo can only be referenced from within the current namespace.

[03:13] <brass> neshpion: If I had to guess, it's because a heredoc is treated as stdin, which messes up `get`

[03:14] <cj> with `package lala; our $foo = x;` the current namespace can manipulate the variable, but you can also refer to it as $lala::foo from code outside the current namespace

[03:14] <brass> When you call a file with `raku <file>`, you're telling it to interpret that file, but leaving stdin connected to the terminal 

[03:15] <neshpion> oh so then it must automatically be eating its own heredoc as the input to `get`, and then it hits `$name` which is undefined and throws the error

[03:15] <brass> That would be my guess

[03:16] <brass> Heredocs are fed as stdin to the called program 

[03:24] <brass> neshpion: Actually now that I think about it, I bet raku waits for the end of the heredoc before compiling the program and running it, so by the time it reaches the `get`, stdin is already closed and it returns Nil

[03:25] <neshpion> that makes more sense

[03:25] <neshpion> and then i try to read $name in a `say` line

[03:25] <neshpion> which is NiL

[10:10] <PimDaniel> hazim: May i help you? what is the compile error?

[10:11] <PimDaniel> But I do not know Cro, so may be i'm not the best one to help you.

[10:12] <hazim> thanks PimDaniel, it is from https://cro.services/

[10:12] <PimDaniel> what is Cro?

[10:13] <PimDaniel> :hazim thank's! i'm watching...

[10:14] <hazim> it cant install,

[10:15] *** wamba joined
[10:16] <PimDaniel> hum : interesting

[10:17] <PimDaniel> How it can't install? Have you a log trace?

[10:19] <PimDaniel> Hooo yes : this is zef managed, i'm not very used to it!

[10:20] <hazim> i copy the output

[10:21] <hazim> i use fedora 33 it should install,

[10:21] <hazim> thanks for help and your time PimDaniel

[10:21] <PimDaniel> Is it heavy? I'll try on my Linux.

[10:21] <PimDaniel> Do you know zef?

[10:22] <hazim> yes it is heavy, zef no i just use the command as it is

[10:23] <PimDaniel> It seams that it's a Native part that did not compile but you should have possibility to get more precise log.

[10:23] <PimDaniel> A kinda library did not compile.

[10:23] *** shan joined
[10:24] <PimDaniel> on Libraries it's often un unresove dependency.

[10:24] <PimDaniel> I'm on Debian 10.

[10:25] <hazim> yes i think  it is  un unresove dependency i will try ubuntu or debian

[10:28] *** hazim left
[10:29] <jmerelo> .tell hazim that fails from time to time. You can try and install it by hand in advance.

[10:29] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to hazim

[10:29] <jmerelo> PimDaniel: cro is a net services framework, including microservices. It's very cool.

[10:30] <PimDaniel> :jmerelo very interesting!

[10:30] <jmerelo> PimDaniel: can you repeat again the question you made at 10:59? A bit of context doo?

[10:33] <lizmat> yeah, that looks like a bug

[10:33] <elcaro> PimDaniel: from what I can tell it's hitting this Exception in NQP-land

[10:33] <elcaro> https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/a2435ee1fb3830564ee9812c2172ba17554ff608/src/vm/js/nqp-runtime/ctx.js#L405

[10:33] <PimDaniel> YES: Try to make a CLASS A  and into this class a method with one int8 try to use it with a number in the caller, next change that method to multi 

[10:34] <elcaro> probably best to raise a GitHub issue on Rakudo repo with a code snippet that reproduces the issue

[10:34] <PimDaniel> I mean a method with an int8 parameter, then after, change it to multi it does not recognize type., then change multi to Int , it does.

[10:35] <PimDaniel> No problem i'll do it.

[10:36] <PimDaniel> .tell hazim i tried to install cro and i got theses erreurs => /usr/bin/ld : ne peut trouver -ltommath /usr/bin/ld : ne peut trouver -latomic_ops

[10:36] <tellable6> PimDaniel, I'll pass your message to hazim

[10:38] <PimDaniel> .tell hazim but theses are easy to resolve has you may know, but you can may be check if you have theses libraries  anyway.

[10:38] <tellable6> PimDaniel, I'll pass your message to hazim

[10:38] <PimDaniel> clear

[11:15] <jmerelo> PimDaniel: those seem to be MoarVM dependencies. Also, if that's Fedora, the second one might be indeed a problem with Raku

[11:20] *** sjm_uk left
[11:21] <PimDaniel> :jmerelo i did not go futher for now.

[11:21] <PimDaniel> Not sure i want to install it on my machine for now.

[11:21] <PimDaniel> I wonder if what i try to describe is a bug.

[11:22] <PimDaniel> when i say 42 what type is it?

[11:23] <PimDaniel> What is Num compare to Int?

[11:24] <jmerelo> PimDaniel: Num is any kind of number

[11:24] <PimDaniel> :jmerelo , OK!

[11:24] <jmerelo> PimDaniel: Int is, well, an integer

[11:25] <PimDaniel> If i want to convert to a smaller type  : eg uint6 how to i make it?

[11:26] <PimDaniel> There's no conversion method , no?

[11:27] <PimDaniel> Not for this type AFAIK.

[11:28] <PimDaniel> re '42.uint16.say' => No such method 'uint16' for invocant of type 'Int'.

[11:31] <PimDaniel> This seams to pose problem for multi methods , and maybe subs.

[11:32] <jmerelo> uint16 is a native type, which is always "boxed" into a "normal" type. So no, there's no conversion method. https://docs.raku.org/language/nativetypes#index-entry-uint16 They are mainly for nativecall functions.

[11:34] <PimDaniel> If i didn't paste code yet it's because i'm wondering and testing since 1 hour, but i'll post anyway.

[11:34] *** jmerelo left
[11:50] *** cydf joined
[11:53] <elcaro> PimDaniel: just to clarify, Num is not any number... it's Raku's floating point type

[11:53] <PimDaniel> elcaro: hoo hoo !

[11:53] <elcaro> if you want a function to accepts any numeric valua, use Numeric (or Real if you don't need to support Complex numbers)

[11:54] <PimDaniel> Okay Okay : good to know!

[11:54] <PimDaniel> but i'll post my code soon anyway.

[11:55] <elcaro> secondly re native types... I think in my limited NativeCall experience, your public facing function can have foo(Int $x)... which can pass to your native function bar(int32 $x), and it will work

[11:55] <elcaro> unless your Int is too big, in which case... you have to validate that yourself in the outer function

[11:55] <PimDaniel> Yes, i watched that!

[11:56] <PimDaniel> But it should work and control proper type i think! 

[11:56] <PimDaniel> Or it's a type problem or it's a signature problem which is linked anyway.

[11:58] <PimDaniel> I do not say it's a bug, but i need to publish just to see.

[11:58] <elcaro> You could also create a subset: subset Int8 of Int where * ~~ -128..127; foo(Int8 $x) { bar($x) }

[12:44] <PimDaniel> Well in fact: i made a sutile error: to avoid method|sub  many(uint8 $a,uint8 $b, Bool :$str=False) the ':' here is no use and produces bad behavior.

[12:44] <PimDaniel> Now it just does not work with constant litterals which is correct since thez are considered Int.

[12:52] *** |oLa| left
[12:55] <PimDaniel> and for this case, the subset is a solution.
