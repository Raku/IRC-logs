[06:02] <mfiano> Hi. Newbie here, trying to figure out some problem with the repl.
[06:02] <mfiano> Works on 1 line, but not 2: https://i.lisp.cl/kpfZtk.png
[06:03] *** squashable6 joined
[06:03] *** benchable6 joined
[06:07] <elcaro> The REPL doesn't play with some of the more dynamic features of Raku, particulary it doesn't work very well with new operators
[06:07] <elcaro> unless it's all on one line, as you have found
[06:12] <mfiano> Unfortunate
[06:12] <mfiano> Thanks

[07:02] <moon-child> should ^^ not be -5?
[07:03] *** bisectable6 joined
[07:03] <moon-child> weirder is this
[07:03] <moon-child> m: say <1 2 3>.map(&[-]); say <1 2 3>.map(&[~])
[07:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 40bf3f3e8: OUTPUT: «(-1 3)␤(1 2 3)␤»
[07:04] <moon-child> I understand each behaviour in isolation, but they seem inconsistent
[07:04] <gfldex> m: say prefix:<->(5)
[07:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 40bf3f3e8: OUTPUT: «-5␤»
[07:04] <gfldex> m: say infix:<->(5)
[07:05] <gfldex> m: say infix:<->(5)
[07:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 40bf3f3e8: OUTPUT: «5␤»
[07:05] <moon-child> because:   multi sub infix:<->($x = 0) { $x.Numeric }
[07:06] <gfldex> &[-] defaults to infix by design
[07:06] <moon-child> yes.  The question is, why does infix - with one param not negate?
[07:06] <moon-child> and given it does not, why does infix ~ with one param stringify?
[07:08] <gfldex> Because, no matter the multicandidate, operators coerce and guarantee to return a specific type.
[07:09] <moon-child> neither &infix:<->'s proto nor &infix:<~>'s guarantee a specific return type; so it is purely conventional
[07:10] <gfldex> Roast demands them to.
[07:11] <moon-child> that's fine, but I want to know why?
[07:11] <moon-child> (also about the discrepancy between the map results)
[07:12] <gfldex> Because Larry said so, basically. It is a fundamental design principle not to confuse humans with overloading the same operator over and over again.
[07:13] <gfldex> If you see `~`, you know you gonna get a Str.
[07:13] <moon-child> I mean, why does &[-](5) != -5?
[07:14] <gfldex> Becaue [stuff] is a reduction operator and those are defined to take an infix as a function argument.
[07:14] <moon-child> yes, the question is why does &infix:<-> not negate when called with one parameter?
[07:15] <gfldex> Thus, even with higher order operator programming, you know what you gonna get.

[10:41] <CIAvash> I guess that's the reason for the discrepancy between the map results, `&[-]` doesn't have a candidate with arity 1
[10:51] <mfiano> As a newbie I'm especially confused over why "[-] 42" is not -42
[10:52] <moritz_> m: say [-] 10, 2
[10:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar ffaf453dd: OUTPUT: «8␤»
[10:52] <mfiano> Coming from a standardized language, it's hard for me to swallow "because the test suite mandates it" or "because Larry said so"
[10:53] <moritz_> why would [-] 42 be -42 but [-] 42, 0 be +42?
[10:54] <moritz_> unary [-] is ambiguous, which is why it's not defined
[10:54] <mfiano> How is it ambiguous? It is well defined in other languages, no?
[10:55] <moritz_> 12:53 < moritz_> why would [-] 42 be -42 but [-] 42, 0 be +42?
[10:55] <moritz_> that's what I mean
[10:56] <mfiano> I don't know what the latter even means
[10:56] <mfiano> I am talking about unary
[10:56] <moritz_> but that's -42, not [-] 42
[10:56] <moritz_> -42 is defined in raku
[10:57] <mfiano> So you can't apply - to a single argument
[10:57] <moritz_> not if you use it as an infix operator, no
[10:57] <moritz_> in -42, it's a prefix operator
[10:57] <mfiano> how would you do so as a prefix operator without the literal -42?
[10:57] *** immediate joined
[10:58] <mfiano> say applying a variable only known at runtime to the - operator
[11:00] <moritz_> -$foo also uses the prefix operator
[11:01] <mfiano> Ok, makes sense.
[11:02] *** reportable6 joined
[11:02] <mfiano> Sorry for the dumb questions. Coming from Lisp and this is all new to me.
[11:02] <moritz_> the infix operator is, by its nature, a binary operator -- it always stands between two terms
[11:02] <mfiano> Thanks :)
[11:02] <moritz_> so if the operator is associative, it's easy to come up with a sensible degenerate case for just one argument
[11:03] <moritz_> but both - and / are not associative (so  a - (b - c) and (a - b) - c) are not the same), so such a reduction doesn't follow automatically
[11:03] <moritz_> you're welcome

[14:29] <[Coke]> ah, I'm an idiot. Thanks. :)
[14:31] *** ggoebel left
[14:31] <[Coke]> (there was a done in both of the react blocks). If I wanted a single react block to handle both procs, not sure if/how I could do that.

[15:58] <melezhik> another interesting use for mybfio - people could announce new versions releases of their modules, by just adding a comment to a project reviews page
[15:58] <melezhik> as the system will pop a project  up to the top of the list upon this comment
[16:00] <melezhik> so that users would quickly share their opinions on the new version, you don't even have to go long way of creating a new post on any social media ... just a thought ...

[20:28] <melezhik> Petr - thanks
[20:29] <melezhik> berber44 a sort of defense right now, that only GH authenticated uses can do posts, so at least a spammer needs to have a GH account, so it could be tracked down ...
[20:31] <melezhik> I also thought maybe I could add category "languages", add add Rakudo to, and then for every Rakudo release - a new release comment could be added , so that users can give feedback on new release ... anyway just a thought ...
