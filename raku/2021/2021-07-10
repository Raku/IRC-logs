[01:40] <lucs> Is rakubrew reliable to use?
[01:41] <avuserow> .
[01:41] <tellable6> 2021-07-09T22:44:45Z #raku <SmokeMachine> avuserow have you taken a look at Red’s SQL generation? Mostly on how it converts Raku’s  code into SQL?
[01:41] <tellable6> 2021-07-09T22:47:16Z #raku <SmokeMachine> avuserow it seems more magical than what you want… but maybe it worths taking a look
[01:42] <avuserow> lucs: yes.
[01:43] <lucs> Okie doke, thanks.
[01:43] <avuserow> SmokeMachine: I have seen Red. It is definitely too much magic but I am very intrigued in how it works. I haven't delved far enough to get to how the magic is made
[01:44] <avuserow> lucs, I usually install the latest commit, which usually works fine, but you might be better served by installing the latest release.
[01:44] <SmokeMachine> avuserow: we override many operators to make them return Red::AST objects and based on that we generate the SQL
[01:45] <lucs> avuserow: Yeah, I'll stick to stable, thanks.
[01:46] <lucs> I was about to start asking questions about problems I'm having, but realized I'm running 2020.01, so I'll level up a bit :)
[01:46] <SmokeMachine> avuserow: we also have some control exceptions to find Boolean tests inside of map/grep/join blocks that helps it to create SQL based on those blocks
[01:47] <avuserow> SmokeMachine: wow, fancy
[01:47] <avuserow> I am hoping that if I ever need a "more magic" module, we'll have macros. but operator overloading is pretty cool too.
[01:48] <avuserow> I briefly considered writing a Slang or using a block to somehow generate where clauses... but I have a real application to finish too :)
[01:50] <SmokeMachine> avuserow: we intent to replace the way we discover what a block do and treate Red::AST by a simple translation RakuAST -> Red::AST once RakuAST is released…
[01:51] <SmokeMachine> One could also use Red::AST directly to generate SQL if needed…
[01:54] <SmokeMachine> a avuserow this is how it “understands” the blocks: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/PrepareCode.pm6#L56
[01:56] <SmokeMachine> avuserow: and here is where the control exception I told you is thrown: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/AST.pm6#L28
[01:57] *** john joined
[01:58] <avuserow> very interesting.
[01:58] <SmokeMachine> So, every time we find a new Boolean test inside the block we add a new column on the truth table and duplicate the rows (1 time for true value and the other for false value)

[19:03] <casaca> hi rakudoers. I'm trying to install `NativeLibs` on openbsd, one the tests, 02-cannon-name.t fails on line 13. i think it's because `platform-library-name` in VM.p6 explicitly prevents appening the version number to the library name if running on windows, darwin, or openbsd

[19:06] <casaca> [NativeLibs] # Failed test 'libfoo.so.2'
[19:06] <casaca> [NativeLibs] # at t/02-cannon-name.t line 13
[19:06] <casaca> [NativeLibs] # expected: 'libfoo.so.2'
[19:06] <casaca> [NativeLibs] #      got: 'libfoo.so'
[19:14] <guifa> casaca: interesting.  You might try posting in #raku-dev as well (sometimes responses in either room can be a bit slow especially on weekends, but hopefully someone will have a quick fix for you)

[19:58] <ugexe> "libfoo.3.dylib".IO
[19:58] <ugexe> looks like it works to me

[22:08] <casaca> ugexe: ty for taking the time, but you seem to be running on macOS. it fails on openbsd
[22:08] <ugexe> yeah, im running on darwin
[22:08] <ugexe> and afaik it works on windows as well
[22:09] <ugexe> but you said it doesnt work on windows, darwin, or openbsd
[22:11] <guifa> ugexe: I read it as saying that VM.p6 did something differently on those systems, rather than failing on all of them.  Might be mistaken though.
[22:12] <ugexe> VM.pm6 is doing the right thing on darwin and windows
[22:13] <ugexe> what i think they might be getting at is something is wrong with NativeLibs, and not anything core raku like VM.pm6
[22:14] <casaca> it works on those two because they don't need to append the version number; but you have to on openbsd. 
[22:16] <casaca> $version.defined and nqp::iseq_i(nqp::add_i(nqp::add_i($is-darwin,$is-win),$is-openbsd),0)
[22:17] <casaca> imo, openbsd needs to be taken out of that check. ill check in #raku-dev
[22:20] <ugexe> thats why im confused, because i just showed you the output of a darwin system that includes the version

[22:24] <casaca> ah, check out after line 88 with comment: "OS X needs version before extension" on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/VM.pm6
[22:26] <casaca> they take care of that a few lines above the check I posted before
