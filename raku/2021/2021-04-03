[09:21] <PimDaniel> Is there a way to get current indice in a for loop deploying an array : for @thing -> $one { say $l.current_indice;} ?

[09:21] *** sena_kun joined
[09:21] <PimDaniel> Or should i use for 0 .. @thing.end {...} ?

[09:22] <PimDaniel> I just wonder each time what permits the langage.

[09:22] <gfldex> PimDaniel: Array can have holes. You need to iterate over .kv to cover those.

[09:23] <PimDaniel> Thank you gfldex : thought .kv was for hashes.

[09:24] <PimDaniel> I'll give a try of what you say...

[09:25] <PimDaniel> m: my @myarray = <a b c d e f g>; for @myarray.kv -> $k,$v { say 'k: ', $k,' ,v: ', $v}

[09:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «k: 0 ,v: a␤k: 1 ,v: b␤k: 2 ,v: c␤k: 3 ,v: d␤k: 4 ,v: e␤k: 5 ,v: f␤k: 6 ,v: g␤»

[09:26] <PimDaniel> Ok thank's

[09:29] <gfldex> m: sub spy(\v) { say v with v; v }; (my @sparce)[0,2,3] = 1,3,4; loop { last without spy @sparce[$++] }

[09:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[09:29] <gfldex> PimDaniel: if you want to loop, loop is likely better the for. :)

[09:30] <PimDaniel> why?

[09:31] <PimDaniel> loop (my $i = 0;<end condition>; $i++) { ... } why should it be better that  for @thing.kv -> $k,$v { .... } ???

[09:33] <PimDaniel> For what i'm currently doing : i need 1/ to deploy the array 2/ to get the current array indice.

[09:34] <gfldex> It is easier the (human) reader to spot that you want to skip the buildin iteration. Assuming that's what you want to do. So for your case it's indeed fine to use .kv. 

[09:34] <PimDaniel> My array has not holes for sure.

[09:35] <PimDaniel> Très bien merci gfldex :) .

[09:37] <PimDaniel> Back later...
