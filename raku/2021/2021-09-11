[01:49] <guifa> Hmm

[01:50] <guifa> "lang-call cannot invoke object of type 'VMNull' belonging to no language"

[01:51] <guifa> I'm assuming that this is related to new-dispatch, yeah?

[01:55] <japhb> xinming and anyone interested in CBOR support for Capture: I have drafted https://github.com/japhb/cbor-specs/blob/main/capture.md -- please review and let me know any comments before I submit the tag spec to IANA.

[01:56] <japhb> Meanwhile I just pushed to GitHub a CBOR::Simple with support for the proposed spec.  (I'll bump version and upload to zef once the IANA spec is approved.)

[11:11] <hamza79> Hey!

[11:12] <hamza79> I am looking into Raku. I was thinking of using it pretty heavily.

[11:14] <hamza79> How is Raku as a functional programming language?

[12:31] <whatnext> hello everyone - I hope I am not spamming the wrong channel in posting this here, but I just wanted to give this community a heads up that I've just put a raku job on upwork

[12:33] <whatnext> ie a chance for someone to turn your raku hobbying into paid work? (I don't see much paid work out there for raku yet, could be looking in the wrong place though)

[13:56] <lizmat> do you have a lnk?

[14:03] <whatnext> https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~019a1c4e085caf7650

[14:04] <whatnext> you might need to be logged in to upwork to see it

[14:08] <lizmat> works fine without being logged in

[14:27] <xinming> sorry, the system was down, anyone reported the `fully-reified on a null object` issue? or we have that fixed already.

[14:28] <lizmat> xinming: doesn't ring a bell to me
