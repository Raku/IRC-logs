[08:35] <frost> hello, I use zef to installl a specific module by indicating the installation path, and I wonder if it will be upgraded under that path when I use `zef upgrade xxx(that module)` without indicating path

[08:35] <tellable6> 2021-11-22T13:26:43Z #raku <lizmat> frost most likely not

[17:28] <qorg11> Nothing but i'm just learning raku doing this

[17:29] <lizmat> perhaps a gist of the code that you're working on, could help find someone interested in looking at the problem deeper  :-)
