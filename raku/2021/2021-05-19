[14:39] <tonyo> unclechu: it's the shell that interprets the path..it is possible to make a shell that has a hash as a path, or make a windows shell that uses `:`
[14:39] <ugexe> yeah seems like I (or maybe we) will need to advocate moving off freenode
[14:40] <tonyo> what's wrong with freenode?
[14:40] <tonyo> they're investing in wrong crypto?

[14:42] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> why not #raku on irc.perl.org
[14:42] *** lizmat joined
[14:43] <patrickb> tonyo: There was a hostile takeover. All bets are off how long the servers will keep runnig after all current staff left the shif and sponsoring dries up (which I just guess will, because why should they continue sponsoring freenode when its on its basically a different project now?)
[14:43] *** gordonfish joined

[14:49] <ugexe> i only want people to lose money on me being in their system

[15:15] <ingy> I managed to register my nicks and chans
[15:15] <ingy> What a mess
[15:16] <lizmat> this does not bode well as to what freenode will become: https://www.irc.com/lets-take-irc-further
[15:16] <tonyo> i already registered #yaml
[15:16] <ingy> I guess we both did
[15:17] <jdv> i guess if you squint enough one could call it a case of "creative destruction"
[15:18] <ugexe> i gradumated from irc university by andrew lee
[15:18] <tyil> lizmat: Raku project registration submitted, now we just wait
[15:19] <tyil> I'm going to guess they're gonna get back in a couple days, asking to properly verify that I am indeed related to the project, and that I indeed have the authority to make the claim in the first place, and after that it generally settles pretty quickly
[15:19] <lizmat> tyil++
[15:20] <tyil> with some luck, it should be done before the next RSC meeting
[15:20] <lizmat> that'd be cool
[15:22] <jjatria> That post has, a lot, of commas, that don't really, belong
[15:24] <jdv79> wow, that guy is somethin'

[17:43] <lizmat> resignation letters: https://blog.bofh.it/debian/id_461
[17:44] <El_Che> As it is now known, the freenode IRC network has been taken over by a Trumpian wannabe korean royalty bitcoins millionaire. 
[17:44] <El_Che> I love the first sentence :)
[17:46] <lizmat> yeah...  but sad nonetheless
[17:46] *** nine joined

[17:47] <lizmat> fortunately good things rose from its ashes, (aka freedom.nl)
[17:47] <El_Che> lizmat: xs4all :(
[17:48] <lizmat> yeah... look at their homepage: https://www.xs4all.nl
[17:48] <lizmat> advertising their "parent" company with a better deal than xs4all can offer
[17:48] <lizmat> what does that tell you ...
