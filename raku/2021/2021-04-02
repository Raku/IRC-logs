[08:13] <frost-lab> I'm curious about that how to declare a function with variadic parameters using NativeCall ?

[08:16] <frost-lab> It seems that that is not mentioned in the document.

[08:24] <moon-child> can you just declare a slurpy param?

[12:54] <smolck> Overall, my goal is to just use Raku (or at least try it out) in a Java/Kotlin project, and if I want to do that I'd need to subclass somethings, ideally

[12:55] <smolck> Oh cool, thank you!

[12:56] <MasterDuke> i don't remember how much our docs go into the differences between the backends (maybe not at all), but that might be a good issue to raise in the docs repo also. or stackoverflow

[12:57] <MasterDuke> i can say that the jvm backend is not the primary one (anymore), so it definitely has warts and doesn't do as much as the moarvm backend

[12:58] <smolck> Looking through I didn't see any docs on the topic (except for how to build the different backends in the Rakudo README and maybe some small mentions here and there), fwiw

[12:58] <smolck> But yeah I have read around and seen people saying that sort of thing about the JVM backend

[12:59] <smolck> To me, it would be really cool to be able to use Raku in the same setting as one could use, say, Scala or Kotlin, but if that's not possible then no worries

[13:06] <lizmat> smolck: one of the big deficiencies of the JVM backend is the lack of support for NFG

[13:07] <MasterDuke> most of the jvm work occurred when it was called perl 6, so that's a better search term

[13:07] * lizmat happens to be working on the uni* functions now

[13:09] *** linkable6 joined
[13:10] <smolck> lizmat: any issues on adding NFG support/related to it for the JVM backend? quick search didn't yield anything in the rakudo repo

[13:11] <lizmat> NFG is implemented in MoarVM afaik, and partly on the JavaScript backend, if I'm not mistaken

[13:12] <smolck> MasterDuke: re SO: don't appear to be any questions/answers on subclassing Java classes and such, unfortunately. Although I guess I could just test it myself . . .

[13:15] <smolck> lizmat: is there any work being done on it for the JVM backend, out of curiosity?

[13:16] <lizmat> I think usev6 has looked at doing it a few times...  but it *is* a lot of work, and I seem to recall that the JVM is sorta fighting alternate unicode implementations / support

[17:37] <leont> What's the trick for "X elements out these list". Essentially «map { <a b c>.pick } 1..4», except without the map.

[17:38] <leont> (and no, pick(4) isn't the same)

[17:39] <japhb> leont: .roll(4)?

[17:39] <leont> Yeah, that's the one

[17:39] <leont> Probably the docs for both should refer to the other, with an explanation of the difference

[17:40] <japhb> Nod

[17:43] <codesections> The pairing of .pick and .roll always makes me think of basketball

[21:46] <Xliff> \o

[21:47] <Xliff> When I run `raku -e 'use Build; Build.build' in a directory with a Build.pm6 file present, why am I getting an error with this message: "Please note that a 'META6.json' file was found in '.', of which the 'provides' section was used to determine if a dependency is available or not.  Perhaps you need to add 'Build' in the <provides> section of that file?  Or need to specify a directory that does *not* have a 'META6.json' file?"

[21:49] <ugexe> you aren't providing any -I. or -Ilib ?

[21:50] <Xliff> Not the first time. Did the second time with the same result

[21:50] <ugexe> well the results cant be the same unless you have a module named "Build" installed

[21:51] <Xliff> Not "installed" as in the zef sense.

[21:51] <ugexe> anyways even if you provide a path, does that path contain a META6.json? and if so does that META6.json contain a Build.pm6 file? I would assume no, and thus you can't use e.g. `-I.` to load a Build module

[21:52] <Xliff> OK. So I'm trying to make a Build.pm6 file for zef, and I want to test it. What is the best way to do that?

[21:53] <ugexe> if you run `zef build . --verbose` it should show you the command it uses

[21:53] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/dc85148b597453fa2fb0113a8488d4073651bae2/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/LegacyBuild.rakumod#L85 is the actual command

[21:54] <ugexe> but basically you `require $path_to_Build_dot_rakumod; ::("Build").build(...)`

[21:54] <Xliff> Getting a FAIL with no additional information.

[21:54] <ugexe> well all it does is run the build file

[21:54] <ugexe> if your build file doesn't provide any insight you wont get any

[21:56] <Xliff> Ah! The trick was 'require'.
