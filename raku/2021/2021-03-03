[11:10] <andinus> i have rakudo star 20.10 installed, do i just have to install it again to upgrade to the latest release?

[11:10] <andinus> i'm compiling it from source

[11:11] *** xinming left
[11:13] *** xinming joined
[11:13] <El_Che> what OS?

[11:14] <MasterDuke> was star updated?

[11:16] <andinus> i'm on openbsd

[11:17] <andinus> MasterDuke: yes star was updated to 2021.02 

[11:17] <andinus> El_Che: on openbsd

[11:17] <El_Che> andinus: I don't use star, but as far as I know, it will recompile for a new release

[11:17] <MasterDuke> oh good, i hadn't realized that

[11:17] <andinus> yeah i know but i was wondering if i should uninstall the old star and install the new one or is there a upgrade script?

[11:19] <andinus> MasterDuke: ah, it was announced on perl6-users list

[11:21] <MasterDuke> a pull and rebuild should be sufficient

[11:22] <andinus> i see, thanks

[12:36] <andinus> thanks! i'll try installing it tonight

[12:36] <andinus> so i'm doing oop things for the first time. i defined a class called Puzzle and set @.grids variable, user passes it to me. 

[12:37] <andinus> there is a @.start-points array, it contains the starting points of the puzzle

[12:37] <andinus> the points are marked in the puzzle itself with a '*'

[12:38] <andinus> i would prefer that its parsed and @.start-points it set by itself when i invoke Puzzle.new

[12:38] <andinus> how do i achieve this? or is there a better way?

[12:39] <tyil> andinus: I think a question like this would be a better fit for StackOverflow, if you use it

[12:39] <tyil> then you can include the code you have so far, and which specific part of the code you want help with

[12:39] <MasterDuke> sounds like something that might get done in a TWEAK()

[12:40] <andinus> i see, i'll post it there

[13:01] <andinus> is there an equivalent for .chop that removes chars from the start?

[13:02] <lizmat> .substr(#charstochopfromstart)

[13:02] <lizmat> m: say "foobar".substr(3)

[13:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «bar␤»

[13:02] <andinus> ah right

[13:03] <lizmat> m: say "foobar".substr(0,*-3)     # alternate syntax for chop

[13:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[13:03] <andinus> MasterDuke: thanks, looks like BUILD is what i wanted

[13:03] <lizmat> andinus: we're thinking on de-emphasizing BUILD for TWEAK in the documentation

[13:03] <lizmat> please be sure you need BUILD, and not TWEAK  :-)

[13:04] *** PimDaniel left
[13:04] <andinus> i see, i need to set a variable from the given data only if that variable is not passed by the user

[13:05] <lizmat> aha!

[13:05] <andinus> whats the differece b/w BUILD and TWEAK?

[13:05] <lizmat> then you don't need BUILD or TWEAK at all

[13:05] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.foo = 42 }; dd A.new

[13:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => 42)␤»

[13:07] <andinus> if bar is not passed then i set it to foo*2, if passed then i dont tweak it

[13:08] <lizmat> afk for while&

[13:09] *** aindilis left
[13:09] *** hythm left
[13:09] <andinus> oh i see

[13:09] <andinus> what does & after "afk for while" mean?

[13:10] <MasterDuke> just a reference to backgrounding a process on the command line

[13:12] <andinus> i see, btw i'm sorry i should've provided the actual code from the start

[13:13] <andinus> i'm trying to do this: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/37bf5357/

[13:13] <andinus> that @puzzle should be @!grids ^

[13:14] <codesections> I was actually wondering about the & symbol too.  I got the CLI reference, but does it add any extra meaning?  (that is, does "afk&" mean anything different than "afk"?)

[13:14] <codesections> It's not a usage that I've seen in other IRC channels

[13:14] <andinus> i think i this question on mastodon earlier this week

[13:15] <andinus> s/this/saw this/

[13:15] <andinus> & thing

[13:16] <codesections> andinus: probably because I asked this question on mastodon earlier this week :)

[13:17] <MasterDuke> i don't think there's any extra meaning meant by adding the &

[13:17] <codesections> that's kind of what I figured.  It just seemed unlike us to type 4 chars where 3 will do!

[13:21] <MasterDuke> but for a joke/nerdy reference, there's no limit to what someone will do

[13:22] <tadzik> I always see it as "I'm going into the background"

[13:22] <tadzik> though it's a bit reduntant in the context of "afk" :)

[16:30] <PimDaniel> It seams that there are no autoflush.

[16:31] <PimDaniel> \o

[17:24] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[17:25] <andinus> why doesn't this work ^ ?

[17:31] <jmerelo> andinus: IIRC set uses object equality, that is, being exactly the same object.

[17:33] <andinus>  i see

[17:34] <andinus> why does it say True for "h" and not for (1,2) ?

[17:34] <jmerelo> m: my @t = $(1,2), $(2,3); say so $(1,2) ∈ @t

[17:58] <cetjs2> jmerelo, is new ideas added, right?

[18:01] <jmerelo> cetjs2: IIRC, a new one was added for the Raku Pull Request Club. It was merged after the deadline.

[18:02] <jmerelo> BTW, you can still add ideas to that repo while the application is being considered https://perl-foundation-outreach.github.io/gsoc-2021-ideas/, or support as mentor any othe existing ideas

[18:02] <jmerelo> Attending now a webinar for Season of Docs, where Google supports technical writers for different organizations. Will try to apply too.

[18:36] <PimDaniel> Hi again!

[18:37] <PimDaniel> Not sure some understood my question early this afternoon.

[18:37] <PimDaniel> Except jemerelo perhaps.

[18:40] <PimDaniel> I'm trying to address a method from his inner instance : self. : i have events keys into an hash  { events => {(KEY_UP) => &self.write_up , ... } } , but it does NOT work :(

[18:41] <PimDaniel> I could do it for a sub but not a method.

[19:42] * PimDaniel thank's jeremo. I'm not sure if i understood the code but it seams that the bind_method is built from outside the class. I need it from inside. And why is it so hard to do things that every langages can do in 2 lines?

[23:25] <japhb> For uploading to fez, if you're uploading on behalf of an org (instead of just as yourself doing personal modules), how can you indicate that?  Should I just create additional fez accounts for each GitHub org I want to represent?  But then how do others in my org take over the release pumpkin?
