[13:09] <timo> codesections: with the bouncing ball application, structural sharing doesn't give a benefit, right? since all balls change their position on every frame?

[13:11] <timo> now if we stored a position + direction + time-offset value for every ball in the frames as well as a top-level time, the inner frame data would only ever change individual balls when they bounce

[13:11] <timo> but that's quite possibly not acceptable for the exercise any more

[16:03] <tbrowder> howdy, thnx to todd i have a starting pt for a doc section on installing raku on ms windows. i think it should be in a prominent place and am looking for suggestions. i will convert it to pod so i think it should be part of docs and then have a link on the raku.org site somewhere.

[17:53] <Skarsnik> Hello. Was there a way a to mark some block of code to be treated at something else like Raku? I think something like Inline::C ?

[18:18] <timo> Skarsnik: i do believe we have a Slang::SQL

[18:19] <Skarsnik> ah that neat

[18:20] <Skarsnik> My goal is to write snes asm directly in the raku file (to be 'compiled', not run)

[18:30] <tonyo> compiled how?

[18:41] <Skarsnik> into bytecode. Like I write my Buf $trigger-door = snes lda $45; sta $42; jmp $4850;

[18:41] <Skarsnik> and that give me correct bytecode x)

[18:43] <tbrowder> tonyo: roger, i'll give that a try...

[18:48] <tbrowder> i think it would be best to put it in a separate md file there, something like WINDOWS-INSTALL.md, and refer/link to it in the main README.md

[18:49] <tbrowder> thoughts?

[18:50] *** hkdtam joined
[18:52] <timo> Skarsnik: you can do that. you'll probably want a clear terminator symbol for your slanged pieces, but after that you'll have a piece of raku grammar that you splice into the existing raku grammar

[18:54] <Skarsnik> I wonder if could tag a sub to do that? like sub trigger-door is SNES ($door-id) { lda %door-id; sta $42; jsl $4820}

[20:51] <tonyo> Skarsnik: if you want that it might be easier to get with just writing `lda|sta|jmp` functions to convert that into byte code, you could do a slang for it too though - that'd be realllllllll easy

[21:23] <[Coke]> (instructions on installing on windows) - definitely incorporate into the existing instructions, which I thought were OK.

[21:24] <[Coke]> (but i do my own build on windows, so I may not be following them directly)

[21:31] <Skarsnik> I think I installed rakudo-star for Comma to have it working on Windows, but I use raku in WSL x)
