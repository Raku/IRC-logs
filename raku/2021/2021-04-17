[15:45] <kawaii> Hello, trying to use `EVAL()` but still getting warning about it being unsafe even when I did `use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL;` in the REPL? :)

[15:49] <kawaii> Ah, I see `> use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL; EVAL($code);` works, but not when executed separately - which isn't consistent with how other modules are `use`'d

[16:25] <uzl[m]> ^ It seems someone tagged the post with `perl` ðŸ˜†

[16:25] <lizmat> *sigh*

[16:25] <lizmat> uzl[m]: can you do something about that?

[16:30] <uzl[m]> I asked about removing that tag in the #freenode_#lobsters:matrix.org room, waiting for an answer. As the person who submitted it, I cannot remove the tag on my end apparently.

[16:34] <MasterDuke> the last comment does mention perl a bit, just adding a raku tag seems sufficient

[16:34] <MasterDuke> oh, but it's a link to jnthn's post. yeah, guess the perl tag doesn't make sense

[19:07] <japhb> Are there any reasonably full-featured OpenGL modules?  My searching on modules.raku.org only found GLFW, but I feel like my headache is preventing finding the obvious.

[19:26] <moon-child> japhb: not that I know of.  I did some brief experimentation with rendering in c that was driven by raku.  But I think for your purposes it might be better to go with a higher-level library like ogre3d?

[19:31] <moon-child> (though gl is pretty easy to bind to--no complicated structs, just integer constants and float buffers)

[19:35] <japhb> moon-child: Yeah, I've done GL bindings before (I did the Parrot OpenGL bindings, for instance).  Just didn't want to do that all over again if someone's already got it covered.  :-)

[19:36] <moon-child> yeah, fair enough
