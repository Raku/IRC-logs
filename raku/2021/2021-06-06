[13:58] <El_Che> in intellij looks pretty much the same on linux/macos/windows
[13:58] <El_Che> To configure your IDE, select IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences for macOS or File | Settings for Windows and Linux. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Alt+S or click the Settings/Preferences button on the toolbar.
[13:58] <El_Che> https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html

[14:40] <p6steve> El_Che: thanks for the info, I have tried Comma - Prefs and ⌘, ... neither work ... suspect I will have to pony up the $$$ for a full version
[14:41] <El_Che> p6steve: no, I think it's an intellij feature and not a comma one
[14:41] <El_Che> it should be there
[14:41] <El_Che> (meaning the proofreading is done by intellij and not by comma)
[14:41] <stoned75> trying to make sense of the last paragraph of https://docs.raku.org/type/Int#routine_expmod, about negative "$y", took me far off my math confort zone, if anyone feels inclined to write something in there about modular logarithm, i would be delighted ':)
[14:42] <El_Che> I would be suprised if that is an intellij ultimate and not a intellij community feature
[14:42] <El_Che> (as it's annoying as hell complaing about typos in variable names :) )
[14:43] <p6steve> El_Che: I will keep digging ... I CAN see File - New Project Settings - Prefs for New Projects
[14:43] <El_Che> no, that's the project settings
[14:44] <El_Che> the thing is that I have the intellij ultimate on a mac as well (same license as linux)
[14:44] <El_Che> so I can't check
[14:46] <El_Che> https://stackoverflow.com/a/62138953
[14:46] <El_Che> pretty much my instructions
[14:47] <El_Che> (I use intellij with the comma plugin instead of the comma ide because I also use intellij for other languages)
[14:54] <p6steve> El_Che: I just opened PyCharm Pro (also IntelliJ) and went straight to the equivalent settings - no problem ... so that rules out me not looking in the right place!
[14:56] <p6steve> the SO image you reference has "For current project" at the top --- in Comma I can only find a way to see "For new projects" ... I reckon that this is a Comma Pro feature (maybe just the menus are stomped)
[14:56] <p6steve> really appreciate your help ... back to vi until I save up the money
[14:57] <p6steve> fwiw Comma is very, very good and I haven't even tried the Grammar editor yet... and I am not entirely against paying for sw

[14:59] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[15:01] <p6steve> stoned75: I think that there is an error in the doc ... last para should be say 7.expmod(-2, 5);     # OUTPUT: «4␤»
[15:02] <p6steve> my reasoning is 7 ** 2 = 49 => 49 mod 5 => 4
[15:04] <p6steve> tried checking with repl ... my guess is WRONG
[15:04] <stoned75> ;-)
[15:07] <p6steve> stoned75: found perl does expmod in Big::Int https://perldoc.perl.org/Math::BigInt#bmodpow%28%29
[15:07] <p6steve> sorry Math::BigInt
[15:08] <p6steve> bmodpow($num, -1, $mod) is exactly equiv to bmodinv($num, $mod)
[15:09] <stoned75> ah... lemme check this implementation 
[15:10] <p6steve> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation very helpful explanation of what the heck it is
[15:15] <stoned75> actually its more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse
[15:15] <stoned75> or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm
[15:16] <stoned75> but you geet the idea I guess :-)
[15:16] <stoned75> *get
[15:19] <stoned75> and Math::BigInt::bmodinv()'s doc cloud be shamelessly copied to better document Int.expmod with a negative exponent
[15:19] <stoned75> I'll consider that. thanks ! :-)

[23:26] <raydiak> I can also confirm that it wfm. you'd have to provide a little more information on how you're running it and what you're running it on for anybody besides you to be able to answer that. just a couple random guesses, maybe you're using an old version of rakudo with a bug, or maybe something is getting mangled by your shell
