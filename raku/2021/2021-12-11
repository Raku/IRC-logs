[09:33] <HrBollermann> i need advice. how could i remove the wetness in the grammar?

[09:33] <HrBollermann> https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/rd0s54/2021_day_10_solutions/ho1msmq/?context=3

[09:34] <HrBollermann> i mean the 5 lines that are basically the same, I feel I should be able to abtract those

[09:36] <MasterDuke> moritz_ is the person to ask

[09:42] * HrBollermann summons the arcane underscore devourer

[10:19] <moritz_> wetness?

[10:34] <moritz_> all I can say is that the grammar engine isn't doing a lot of work there, so going without it might be easier :D

[10:35] <moritz_> one could try to generalize the various parens matchers, something like  token paired($open, $close) { $open { $*rep.push: $close } ~ $close <balanced> { $*rep.pop } }

[10:35] <moritz_> dunno if that works

[10:38] <mscha> Ah.

[10:42] <HrBollermann> @moritz_ wetness, as in repeated patterns in code. as in not being DRY

[11:13] <moritz_> yeah, what I said, either try a parameterized token, or get rid of the grammar

[11:19] <HrBollermann> i seem to be too daft to figure out how to call the token

[12:24] <a_friend> quick question: how do i forward declare a class?

[12:30] <El_Che> I would use roles

[12:33] <lizmat> a_friend: to answer the question:

[12:34] <lizmat> m: class A { ... };  class A { has $.foo = 42 }; dd A.new

[12:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5a71ab2a: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => 42)␤»

[12:34] <lizmat> but as El_Che said: you should probably think about using roles if you can

[12:38] <a_friend> i see, thanks for the help

[12:38] <a_friend> i had seen the stackoverflow answer to this question and assumed that "..." was some pseudocode

[12:38] <a_friend> it appears that "..." is some actual syntax
