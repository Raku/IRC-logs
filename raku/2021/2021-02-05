[07:19] <El_Che> [Coke]: I have, for linux

[07:20] <El_Che> [Coke]: I am migrating rakudo-pkg to Github Actions

[07:20] <El_Che> [Coke]: build is fine (now working on uploading to repos)

[07:22] <El_Che> [Coke]: I also added a special devbuild action for e.g. core devs. It can be triggered from the github web ui and it looks like this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/nfpm/docs/devbuild.png

[08:13] <PimDaniel> .tell Coke Thank's Coke. That's what i wanted! I saw .WHO into the reference but used it : THIS.WHO and it gave me nothing i could handle, i must still look at the Classes hierarchy to understand. Merci Bien!

[19:23] <gfldex> i'm trying to create a type with a meta-method via MOP. The meta-method whows up in meta_method_table but is never called. Any pointers would be most welcome.

[19:31] <[Coke]> do you need to recompose?

[20:07] <gfldex> [Coke]: that doesn't work either

[20:10] <gfldex> There must be a way to do this because Rakudo is using the MOP to create types to. Actions.nqp is really hard to brain parse. :-|

[20:23] <patrickb> I just created a PR to rework the Object Tutorial. Feedback welcome! https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3794

[20:34] *** brtastic left
[20:35] <[Coke]> Yes, but Rakudo might be using nqp under the hood.

[20:35] <[Coke]> Might help if you had a small example that didn't work.

[20:42] <gfldex> I can supply any number of small examples that don't work. :)
