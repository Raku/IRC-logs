[07:08] <sarna> hey, what's the difference between Iterable and Iterator? I can't figure it out from the docs
[07:14] <nine> The Iterable is what you iterate over, i.e. some kind of list. The Iterator is what keeps track of where in the iteration you are.
[07:23] <sarna> nine: so if I want to implement a custom collection, what would I implement? both, on two objects? or both on one object? or..
[07:27] <moon-child> you implement Iterable on your collection.  The Iterable returns an Iterator, which contains a bit of state
[07:27] <moon-child> so you need to make both
[07:30] *** Sgeo left
[07:31] <elcaro> I think the minimum is: define a class that `does Iterator` and has a `pull-one` method.
[07:33] <elcaro> m: class M does Iterator { has @.elems = 1..3; method pull-one { @!elems ?? @!elems.shift !! IterationEnd } }; .say for Seq.new(M.new)
[07:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1962e6744: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤»
[07:36] <nine> That's certainly the minimum, but you really want to have Iterable and Iterator separate. Otherwise one can only ever iterate once over your collection.
[07:38] <guifa> Iterable is role.  It says "HEY, you can iterate over me".
[07:39] <guifa> The way things interact with the iterable is by first calling .iterator, which is the thing that actually handles iteration
[07:39] <guifa> that thing is of the role Iterator, and as el caro mentions, the bare minimum is to have a pull one
[07:41] *** linkable6 left
[07:42] <guifa> The example here https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterator#IterationEnd shows this.  An Array is Iterable (so it's not separately declared)
[07:42] <guifa> The .iterator method returns an anonymous iterator that holds its own state (starts at 0, but increments by two after each pull)

[08:26] <MasterDuke> anyone here know where/how one installs the visual studio command line tools thing?

[08:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1962e6744: OUTPUT: «1␤»
[08:28] <moon-child> there's an installer thing
[08:28] <moon-child> it has its own installer, which is . . .
[08:29] <moon-child> but anyway, once you install the installer with the installer installer, you should be able to use it to install the cmdline tools.  It's the same installer as for regular vs
[08:30] <MasterDuke> hm. i see some ms blogposts about enabling it in vs, but i haven't found an installer yet. but i need to download the vs installer, which will have an option for just the command line tools?
[08:30] <moon-child> yes
[08:30] <moon-child> iirc
[08:30] *** feb left
[08:32] <MasterDuke> apparently there's some sort of free-ish community edition of vs, i'll try that installer
[08:35] <holyghost> MasterDuke, search for csc.exe (mcs on linux/unix)
[08:35] <holyghost> e.g. C#
[08:35] <holyghost> the command line edition for C/C++ is online though
[08:37] <holyghost> win7 or win10
[08:39] *** hankache left
[08:42] <MasterDuke> out of the many install options, i don't see one that just says "minimum stuff needed for the developer powershell", so i guess i'll just install a bunch of the c/c++ options and hope for the best (but first, expand the vm's disk)

[09:20] <raydiak> I think you may be looking for "build tools for visual studio" https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019
[09:22] <MasterDuke> ah ha! that looks promising
[09:26] <raydiak> also fwiw, if you're doing this in a vm there's a free image that comes with win 10, visual studio, and some other stuff preinstalled. the catch is it has an expiration. https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
[09:32] <MasterDuke> ugh, still getting 'fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'stdlib.h': No such file or directory'
[09:32] <MasterDuke> but maybe that vm will be easier
[09:34] <raydiak> the trick to the expiration is as far as I ever saw it only stops working on boot, so you just save state on the machine when you close it, never actually reboot the vm. I used it for many months beyond expiration that way
[09:35] <MasterDuke> ha
[09:41] <sarna> nine, elcaro, guifa: thanks for explaining! :)
[09:50] *** perigrin joined
[09:50] *** unspammable6 sets mode: +v perigrin
[09:52] <raydiak> MasterDuke: a number of different suggestions pop up when I search for that error. if you don't have luck with that vm image, maybe just copy/paste the whole error into a search engine. several people suggest completely uninstalling/reinstalling all things related to vs. some people got it after an upgrade, or trying to add the C++ components after the initial install (they aren't included by default
[09:52] <raydiak> apparently). some people found the file and manually added the path to their project's include dirs
[09:53] <raydiak> a myriad of possibilities is covered at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1083
[09:53] <raydiak> including "Most C++ Standard Library header files do not have a .h file name extension."
[10:00] <raydiak> and some people solved it by install the windows 10 sdk from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/
[10:00] <raydiak> what a mess...
[10:05] <MasterDuke> i got moarvm building now, but it's using gmake instead of nmake, which i don't really want. will try that vm when it finishes downloading

[10:31] <raydiak> windows makes me miss dos by comparison. sure it wasn't as pretty and intuitive to the uninitiated, but usually when something didn't work the list of possible causes was extremely short
[10:32] *** synthmeat joined
[10:34] <nine> raydiak: yeah, the simplicity was kinda nice. OTOH "not working" often meant just freezing with no way to debug. The thing I fell in love with instantly when trying Linux for the first time was how chatty it was. Makes finding out what's going wrong so much easier.
[10:39] <raydiak> if something was freezing, you probably set a jumper wrong or your floppy went bad :D I wasn't much of a programmer back then though, can't honestly speak to what it felt like to develop under it besides some GW-BASIC and batch files
[10:39] <raydiak> though don't get me wrong, I'd certainly never advocate for dos over linux
[10:39] <El_Che> (unrelated: I *always* type "ls" in a dos cmd box)
[10:43] <nine> raydiak: let me put it this way: programming under DOS made pressing ctrl+s into a reflex for me :D

[16:41] <hankache> Is there a reason we have no op on #raku?
[16:43] <ugexe> presumably no one has felt compelled to leave themselves opd
[16:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o lizmat
[16:44] <hankache> Yeah!
[16:44] <@lizmat> hankache: does that answer your question?
[16:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o lizmat
[16:45] <hankache> Hehehehe
[16:47] <hankache> What are the benefits/drawbacks of having ops. I understand ops can mute or kick spammers right?
[16:48] * hankache: is trying to understand how IRC works
[16:48] <ugexe> if you consider having to do the work a benefit, then sure
[16:49] <hankache> Benefit for the channel. Not so much for the person do it
[16:49] <ugexe> agreed
[16:51] <ugexe> generally ops mute/unmute the channel, kick or ban people, and change the topic
[16:53] <hankache> I like that it's fast compared to other alternatives 
[16:53] <hankache> Slack literally kills my machine

[20:23] <guifa> is there a way to get Comma to recognize EXPORTHOW stuff ?  Or is the Cro/Red support hardwired in?

[20:27] <b2gills> I would suspect that it is hardcoded.
[20:27] <b2gills> It may be that all you have to do is install the module in the rakudo that Comma points to

[22:00] <guifa> https://gist.github.com/alabamenhu/550e19ccc1e9d15b3f1ce96a501f5efe <-- codesections, this actually works, although the "constant foo = bar" feels pretty word.  
[22:02] <guifa> rbt: I'm thinking that that may be an error in the release notes?
[22:03] <guifa> vrurg can correct me, but I believe the ultimate decision was to just use COERCE in the new coercion protocol, rather than COERCE-FROM and COERCE-INTO
