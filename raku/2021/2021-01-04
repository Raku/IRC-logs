[00:00] <notagoodidea> I am looking at both, did not know either.

[00:00] <notagoodidea> before realizing the shadowing of the first pair I was doing

[00:01] <notagoodidea> `@opt = @opt.split(@marks, :skip-empty, :v).Hash; for @opt.values -> $v is rw { $v .= split(" ") };`

[08:28] <El_Che> ToddAndMArgo: in the method declaration?

[08:28] <El_Che> I have only used has to declare attributes

[08:29] <ToddAndMArgo> yes.  Here is an example I have seen:

[08:29] <ToddAndMArgo> class PROCESSENTRY32 is repr('CStruct') {    has int32 $.dwSize;    has int32 $.cntUsage;    has int32 $.th32ProcessID;    has int32 $.th32DefaultHeapID;    has int32 $.th32ModuleID;    has int32 $.cntThreads;    has int32 $.th32ParentProcessID;    has int32 $.pcPriClassBase;    has int32 $.dwFlags is rw;    HAS uint16 @.szExeFile[MAX_PATH] is

[08:29] <ToddAndMArgo> CArray;};

[08:29] <ToddAndMArgo> It is the last one

[08:32] <ToddAndMArgo> HAS uint16 @.szExeFile[MAX_PATH] is CArray;

[08:32] <El_Che> did you found this? https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#Embedding_CStructs_and_CUnions_with_HAS

[08:32] <El_Che> it's a way to embed a data structure it seems (mind you, I haven't use it)

[08:33] <El_Che> much like other langs do, it seems

[08:33] <ToddAndMArgo> That is perfect.  Thank you!

[10:20] <notagoodidea> leont: Do you know of any ressource that explain a bit more ARGS-TO-CAPTURE? I looked at the source of various GetOpt but it is a bit tedious to extract knowledge from them.

[10:21] <leont> You've seen https://docs.raku.org/routine/ARGS-TO-CAPTURE ?

[10:22] <leont> There's also RUN-MAIN, if you really want to take it all over

[10:22] <notagoodidea> Yep but I am not sure to grasp the Callable part : it can be an introspection of MAIN but can it be another function that handle the argument parsing?

[10:22] <leont> The default RUN-MAIN always uses MAIN

[10:23] <leont> If you want something else, you need a RUN-MAIN override, which is more complicated

[10:24] <notagoodidea> So you format our argument parsing in a Capture that fit MAIN understanding?

[10:24] <notagoodidea> s/our/your

[10:24] <leont> Yeah

[10:25] <notagoodidea> Ok, il will dig more in the source of GetOpt modules, thanks :)

[11:55] <timotimo> the postcircumfix operators for [] (arrays or Positional in general) and {} (hash or Associative in general) take lists, and there's different adverbs (the :blah at the end) that can give different behaviours, not just deleting, but also returning pairs instead of only values, or returning keys and values in one big list

[12:59] <notandinus> ^ in a better way

[13:00] <notandinus> basically i want to get $a if it's defined, if not then get $b if $b is defined, if not then get 4.Int 

[13:01] <jmerelo> notandinus: using with? with $config<profiles>{$profile}<rotate><keep> https://rakudocs.github.io/language/control#index-entry-with_orwith_without-with_orwith_without

[13:01] <jmerelo> notandinus:but TIMTOWDI. So it's not better or worse, just another way.

[13:03] <MasterDuke> $config<profiles>{$profile}<rotate><keep> // $config<rotate><keep> // 4

[13:03] <notandinus> jmerelo: actualy i want to run the same set of commands on all conditions

[13:05] <notandinus> MasterDuke: thanks, // will do the job

[13:09] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[13:10] *** aborazmeh left
[13:20] <notandinus> actually // made lots of things easy

[13:29] <notandinus> Do i just `run umask 077` to set umask?

[13:29] <notandinus> i'm trying to do the equivalent of `umask 077' perl code

[13:30] <jmerelo> notandinus: it's qx IARC in Raku. Also, there's a `run` command: https://docs.raku.org/routine/run

[13:38] <notandinus> i see, thanks, i tried qx, shell but looks like it doesnt affect the script

[13:38] <notandinus> i later make a tar archive with `run' 

[13:39] <jmerelo> Also, you've noticed it should be umask 0777, right?

[13:39] <notandinus> oh 

[13:39] <jmerelo> ah, no, 077 is also a thing... 

[13:39] <notandinus> i always used 077, 

[13:40] <jmerelo> Anyway. Just check if you've got the mask right, that might be it...

[13:40] <jmerelo> notandinus: yep, that's a different thing, sorry.

[13:40] <notandinus> so i checked the umask and looks like it was not changed

[13:40] <notandinus> m: shell 'umask 077'; shell 'umask'

[13:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8150a2864: OUTPUT: ¬´0022‚ê§¬ª

[13:41] <notandinus> ^^

[13:41] <jmerelo> notandinus: also IARC umask affects the shell it's run from, isn't that correct? It's not a system-wide thing. It's not going to work next time you open a shell, as you do with "shell"

[13:42] <notandinus> ah i see, yeah it affects the shell it's run from

[13:42] <notandinus> is there a way to make it affect the script ?

[13:42] <jmerelo> if you use run, it does not spawn a shell.

[13:42] <notandinus> also what's IARC, never read that before

[13:42] <notandinus> but run fails 

[13:42] <jmerelo> If I remember correctly

[13:42] <notandinus> m: run<umask 077>

[13:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8150a2864: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot resolve caller run(...); none of these signatures match:‚ê§    (*@args where { ... }, :$in = "-", :$out = "-", :$err = "-", Bool :$bin, Bool :$chomp = Bool::True, Bool :$merge, Str :$enc, Str:D :$nl = "\n", :$cwd = Code.new, :$env, :$win-verbat‚Ä¶¬ª

[13:43] <notandinus> m: run <umask 077>

[13:43] <notandinus> ^^ because there is no umask(1)

[13:43] <jmerelo> run uses the kernel, it does need to be given the whole path

[13:43] <jmerelo> or is a shell thing...

[13:43] <jmerelo> Let me check

[13:43] <notandinus> jmerelo: i see, 'A' in IARC got me confused

[13:44] <notandinus> jmerelo: yeah it doesn't use the shell

[13:44] <jmerelo> Yep, I can't even remember the acronyms...

[13:44] <notandinus> but because there is no umask(1) (umask program) it fails

[13:44] <jmerelo> yep, umask is shell built-in

[13:44] <notandinus> right

[13:45] <notandinus> this is not an issue though, i've just set the parent's dir permissions correctly

[13:45] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[13:45] <jmerelo> yep

[13:45] <notandinus> so do you know of a way to do this umask thing?

[13:46] <jmerelo> notandinus: I was checking out to see if IO::Path could do that, but it does not... The problem is that I don't think there's support, even at the MoarVM level, for setting default file attributes

[13:47] <jmerelo> notandinus: this is the library MoarVM uses for file access, and check out what's there https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1693

[13:49] <jmerelo> notandinus: also this issue https://github.com/Raku/old-issue-tracker/issues/3680

[13:51] <notandinus> jmerelo: ah i see, thanks

[13:52] <jmerelo> notandinus: I think that you should probably look at lizmat's p5* modules. Or a POSIX distribution.

[13:57] <JRaspass> Is there scope for increasing what IO::Path can do? I would love to be about to set the mtime without resorting to shelling out to touch

[13:58] <El_Che> mijn oudste laptop hier is van 2007 ofzo en batterij is nog altijd ok :)

[13:59] <jmerelo> JRaspass: I don't think so. As I said, all the filesystem stuff is done through NQP and eventually through libuv in MoarVM. And libuv does not seem to have support for that kind of thing.

[13:59] <notandinus> jmerelo: i checked https://github.com/lizmat/P5built-ins, looks like umask is not present there too, i think i'll workaround this for now

[14:00] <notandinus> hmm yeah how could umask be there when libuv doesn't support it

[14:00] <jmerelo> notandinus: possibly using nativecall. You can still get through POSIX calls using it.

[15:20] <tyil> oh

[15:20] <chovy> heh

[15:21] <tyil> no clue then, I've never heard of the programming language v

[15:21] <chovy> i'm liking vlang but community is too small. can you write desktop apps in raku?

[15:21] <chovy> compiled. etc

[15:21] <tyil> how would you define 'app'? I use a desktop, and I write programs in Raku for it from time to time

[15:21] <tyil> but I dont really make "gui" applications

[15:21] <chovy> desktop gui

[15:21] <chovy> with native gui support

[15:22] <chovy> win/mac/linux

[15:22] <tyil> there's support for GTK, at least

[15:22] <tyil> but not yet for Qt iirc

[15:23] <tyil> you should theoretically be able to use qt libs through nativecall relatively easy

[15:23] <tyil> but perhaps it's better to discuss that with someone who knows nativecall :p

[15:23] <perryprog> I can't imagine that'd be the best way of writing a cross-platform app though ;p

[15:24] <tyil> probably not

[15:25] <chovy> perryprog: what you suggest?

[15:49] <lizmat> wouldn't a "modern" program nowadays not use a browser and a locally running webserver backend with something like WebSockets interacting ?

[15:49] <El_Che> chovy: with Go I don't see much the point of v

[15:50] <chovy> its not google

[15:50] <tadzik> perryprog: I delivered a cross-platform Gtk app in Rust a while ago, it wasn't bad

[15:50] <notagoodidea> lizmat: It depends what you want. It is the easiest solution for small desktop stuff or libgui and some others "low-level" lib using SDL and so.

[15:50] <tadzik> and by cross-platform I mean "developed on linux, shipped for windows" :P

[15:51] <perryprog> Oh nothing wrong with GTK, I just meant rolling your own wrapper for it in Raku might be a pain

[15:51] <tadzik> not sure if it qualifies for "easy" though, neither the "rust" nor "gtk" part (or "windows" for that matter)

[15:51] <notagoodidea> If you can leverage Gtk or Qt, you good to go imho. Even Tk.

[15:51] <El_Che> people are often using go or rust in the backend en dart+flutter on the front

[15:51] <perryprog> (And I'm not sure if a Raku app period would be a good idea, but that's just my opinion ;p)

[15:51] <tadzik> heh

[15:51] <El_Che> (again by the googles)

[15:51] <tadzik> Gtk::Simple is decent afaik

[15:51] <notagoodidea> El_Che: flutter have gone full Native or not yet?

[15:52] <codesections> lizmat: I've actually been surprised by how *rarely* I see that architecture these days

[15:52] <notagoodidea> perryprog: It is not a worse idea than a Python/Pick your poison app.

[15:52] <El_Che> their baseline is "Flutter is Google‚Äôs UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. "

[15:53] <El_Che> I have written desktops apps in the past and all I remember is a world of pain

[15:53] <El_Che> (java and perl, mostly)

[15:53] <perryprog> JVM for desktop apps isn't that bad IMO

[15:54] <El_Che> it's terrible

[15:54] <perryprog> I think it's just as good as GTK or Qt.

[15:54] <El_Che> mostly for the user

[15:54] <tadzik> still better than Electron im

[15:54] <tadzik> -o

[15:54] <perryprog> Definitely

[15:55] <tadzik> not that it's a high bar, but it's a depressingly common bar these days

[15:55] <El_Che> got stuck in the pre java fx days

[15:55] <tadzik> isn't flutter this thing that reimplements half of HTML resulting in a11y nightmare?

[15:56] <El_Che> isn't electro pretty close to what lizmat was suggesting?

[15:56] <tadzik> or am I thinking about something else

[15:56] <perryprog> Most Electron based apps are a11y nightmares.

[15:56] <perryprog> Web based "desktop" apps, that is

[15:56] * perryprog glares at Discord

[15:57] <tadzik> well, web itself actually gives you a lot of options to make it right, if you're willing to make the effort

[15:57] <codesections> El_Che: well, Electron is what lizmat was suggesting, plus bundling your own (bloated and out of date) version of the browser

[15:58] <perryprog> tadzik: this is true

[15:58] <perryprog> Slack for examine is pretty good at it

[15:58] <perryprog> And they also allow the option of third party clients

[15:58] <codesections> I meant something that can run in a tab of an existing browser session 

[15:58] <lizmat> fwiw, I was *not* proposing bundling the browser, but work with whatever browser a user has

[16:01] <tadzik> notagoodidea: hmm, if your computer is overloaded with its web browser, would a second web browser actually help?

[16:02] <El_Che> yes

[16:02] <El_Che> if it's another process

[16:02] <El_Che> but, just close some tabs, you hoarders

[16:03] <notagoodidea> tadzik: what I don't see is better to me (as a user).

[16:03] <tadzik> notagoodidea: what is the thing you don't see in this scenario?

[16:04] <notagoodidea> my overloaded browser when you span the second one without opening the first?

[16:04] <codesections> plus you always have the *option* to open a new instance of the browser

[16:04] <notagoodidea> How it will affect the state of the previous session of the user? Or open in incognito mode so you don't affect the session of the user?

[16:04] <tadzik> notagoodidea: wouldn't the second browser be just as slow as the first one if you're already overloaded though? That's what I'm not getting

[16:05] <tadzik> with firefox, and probably others too, you can have completely isolated browser instances for different purposes, fwiw

[16:05] <notagoodidea> Ah oh, I am thinking about the situation when none was already open.

[16:05] <El_Che> wouldn't the memory of the first browser be paged out?

[16:05] <tadzik> notagoodidea: oh, I see

[16:06] <notagoodidea> tadzik: That's is good to know!

[16:06] <codesections> oh, where none is open *and* it's set to re-open all tabs?  

[16:07] <tadzik> yeah, that could indeed be awful

[16:07] <tadzik> separate browser instances are probably more memory-friendly too, since it's actually the same browser running each time and the OS is likely somewhat smart about it

[16:07] <codesections> (I also hoard tabs, but don't restore my session - closing the browser is my way of declaring tab bankruptcy!)

[16:08] <tadzik> heh

[16:08] *** cosimo joined
[16:08] <tadzik> I only hoard a few tabs of "I do want to read this, and I know that if I bookmark it then I never will"

[16:08] <tadzik> (and then I never read it and just close the tab with a sigh after a few weeks)

[16:08] <perryprog> A few weeks? Rookie numbers.

[16:08] <tadzik> :)

[16:09] <codesections> same, except that I don't have the "close the tab" step

[16:09] <[Coke]> I tend to have under a half dozen windows open longer than a day or two. my kid regularly has 100 for weeks. I don't understand it.

[16:09] <codesections> hence the need for bankruptcy 

[16:10] <notagoodidea> codesections: One day I will be able to dot that one day. I hoard tab with the group manager plugin based on context. Like my "Job hunt" group have LinkedIn and a few applications I have to answer too now or later, some group are contextualized by activity, if I want to look at Chess stuff, I want to have X websites at hand.

[16:11] <notagoodidea> I don't have find a good way to do it yet. Containers don't help to not hoard tabs.

[16:12] <tadzik> the fact that hoarding tabs like this is a common theme makes me think that there's an enormous room for improvement in bookmark managers

[16:12] <codesections> agreed

[16:12] <notagoodidea> agreed

[16:12] <tadzik> if my home page had a section for "bookmarked last week" and another for "bookmarked last year" I'll be likely to actually click on them, or just remove them once I forget what I wanted them for

[16:12] <codesections> and browser UI in general 

[16:13] <tadzik> I still wonder if we'd ever get browser tabs if window managers were better in the IE6 days

[16:13] <tadzik> though most of the mainstream ones still aren't :P

[16:13] <notagoodidea> If I good group-bookmark and reopen the all group that will reduce a lot of hoarding.

[16:14] <tadzik> but instead all the browsers are trying to reimplement window managers, poorly

[16:14] <notagoodidea> s/good/could

[16:14] <tadzik> notagoodidea: I'm sure there are browser extensions for that, actually

[16:16] <notagoodidea> Kind of, there is a few with different trade-off, tried a few, I am using Simple Tab Group rigth now but meh.

[16:18] <tadzik> yeah, native stuff tends to work better when it's available. I'm yet to see a Speed Dial as good as the one from old Opera

[16:18] <tadzik> or new Opera, for that matter

[16:20] *** chovy left
[16:20] <notagoodidea> Trying to make it play nice with Containers in Firefox is a chore too.

[16:21] <El_Che> I love firefox containers

[16:21] <tadzik> they're a lifesaver

[16:22] <El_Che> certainly as cookie autodelete works well with them

[16:27] <notagoodidea> I tend to use more more fo thematic grouping than anything so lots of friction on the way.

[16:29] <El_Che> notagoodidea: you can sort tabs by container

[16:32] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to tony-o

[16:37] <melezhik> is it a bug in raku.land? Sparky should 0.0.29, but it's still 0.0.26 - https://modules.raku.org/dist/Sparky:cpan:MELEZHIK VS https://raku.land/cpan:MELEZHIK/Sparky

[16:39] <JRaspass> Looks like the version in the META6.json wasn't updated, it shows 0.0.26 in the 29 tarball for me

[16:39] <JRaspass> we generally trust the json file, not the filename

[16:40] <codesections> unrelated: there's a global Slack outage at the moment.

[16:40] * codesections smug IRC user 

[16:43] <jdv79> nobody knows who runs the irc logger?

[16:44] <melezhik> codesections ++ we see at our \@job 

[16:45] <jdv79> i just realized its down.  it looked ok until i tried to send a msg.

[16:46] <melezhik> JRaspass,  - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/META6.json#L38 , oh , interesting ...

[16:46] <MasterDuke> the colabti website was (still is?) down also

[16:46] <melezhik> I use http://sparrowhub.io/plugin/raku-utils-mi6/0.000003 to release new versions ... I wonder if it's mi6 issue ...

[16:47] <JJAtria[m]> I've had similar issues with mi6 occasionally not updating a version number. I've made it a point to manually check before uploading nowadays

[16:48] *** hungrydonkey joined
[16:48] <JJAtria[m]> Although I think in my case it was not the META file that was not bumped, but the version in one of the modules

[16:49] <JRaspass> i like the image in the markdown though, looks good on the site :-)

[16:50] <melezhik> JRaspass, yeah, thanks , looks good for me to )))
