[06:10] <japhb> raydiak: Yeah, CBOR natively handles object hashes (anything can be a map key), and I believe I handled that right in CBOR::Simple.

[06:11] <japhb> CBOR is pretty good about compactness for a self-describing format.  It also compresses pretty well (well, as far as I've seen in experiments -- zstd seems to like it).

[06:11] <japhb> (Honestly, I took a chance learning CBOR because I needed something like it and was bewildered by the options, and after narrowing it down for a while I just followed my hunch ... and I'm pretty happy with the results so far.)

[08:36] <raydiak> I do remember it being quite extensive, read a lot about it when you first started with it (though I've forgotten a good portion of what I read by now). I'm sure it's suitable, I just meant storing a Capture as one map with different key types vs a map with all str keys and a separate array...not sure which would be better

[08:37] <raydiak> but bed for me now. good * japhb and #raku \o

[12:17] <Geth> Â¦ raku.org/2years-hence: It has been almost 2 years since the name change.  People are starting to be confused about the mention of Perl on the home page.  Removing it feels correct in the sense that Raku is becoming more and more a thing on its own.  Also add "Programming Language" and "open source" for better SEO

[13:25] <Altreus> https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-129/#TASK1  - not sure if parsing that tree is supposed to be part of the task!

[13:26] <Altreus> that seems way harder than answering the question!

[13:26] <Altreus> and thus more interesting :D
