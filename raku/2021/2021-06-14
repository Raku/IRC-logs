[14:43] <xinming> It's quite a bit like in school, I always get confused with am/pm before, But teacher told us remember that letter a is before p, so we'll know which is mornining. :-)

[14:43] <dakkar> I think it's one of those things that are "obvious" to (near) native English speaker

[14:44] <dakkar> xinming: and the am/pm is clearer to Latin speakers üòú
