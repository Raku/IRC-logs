[00:26] <b2gills> lizmat: I just noticed an issue with ValueType. It won't work properly with `.clone(:x(4))`. Something like `submethod CLONE { $!WHICH = Nil }` would be great if it worked.

[12:14] <tyil> and possibly other things I haven't thought of yet

[15:31] <andinus> oh 
[15:32] <andinus> so instead of using the range on @a, we use it in on .kv ; makes sense, thanks
[15:45] <tonyo> yea, 1..* gives you `a, 1, b, 2, c...` you need 2..* because after the .kv you have `0, a, 1, b ...`

[21:03] <jdv79> why wouldn't the chan move?  i think perl moved y'day.
[21:04] <lizmat> that could well be: we want to make sure *we'll* be in charge of the Raku channels before moving
[21:08] <jdv79> not sure why that would not be the case
[21:08] <jdv79> but ok
[21:10] <raydiak> I imagine they're buried in registration requests and we're waiting on a response to our e-mail to make sure it's formalized before we officially move...???...
[21:11] <jdv79> i guess the pottery people could try to lay a claim:)
[21:11] <raydiak> :D
[21:11] <Grinnz> essentially, the project list is copied from freenode, so the raku project exists there, staff will just have to assign appropriate project managers
[21:12] <Grinnz> in other words, it can't be squatted
[21:12] <Grinnz> as long as you trust staff :)
[21:13] *** b2gills joined
[21:13] <jdv79> the people currently squatting are us but ok
[21:13] <Grinnz> i mean the raku namespace as a whole
[21:14] <lizmat> "assign appropriate project managers"
[21:15] <lizmat> I think we need a clean break in that respect from the old freenode situation
[21:15] <lizmat> which is buried in history
[21:15] <jdv79> yeah, i get it.  odd that perl is less conservative than raku on the move.
[21:15] <Grinnz> i would suggest the appropriate management would be those who currently manage the channels, and they can decide what to do wrt history
[21:16] <lizmat> ops is ok, ownership is another matter
[21:18] <jdv79> its irc.  does anyone really own anything?...  though andrew lee seems to think so.
[21:18] <Grinnz> to be perfectly clear: i think liz would be the appropriate management :P
[21:18] <lizmat> I think you forgot a <sarcasm> there
[21:19] <Grinnz> no, sincere
[21:20] *** ggoebel left
[21:24] <raydiak> wrt #perl they have very close ties to former freenode/now libera staff, so their needs may have been expedited, or they may have decided to just get it done and let formalities like namespace control be handled whenever staff catches up
[21:25] <lizmat> fwiw, I just want to be sure that who-shall-not-be-named will not have *any* influence / say on any of the Raku channels
[21:26] <Grinnz> I get that, and I don't think it will be a problem - he isn't on libera staff
[21:27] <Grinnz> and yeah there were a couple staffers in the perl community which expedited it somewhat in that case
[21:27] *** asymptotically left
[21:28] <raydiak> I'm more of the "just get it done" mindset, but it sounds like there are more political concerns at play than I'm aware of
[21:29] <raydiak> and anyway I don't assume it's a community voting matter, I figure RSC is handling this in the way they see fit
[21:29] <lizmat> the RSC is aware of it  :-)
[21:29] <lizmat> tyil++ is handling the registration
[21:30] <lizmat> JJ already has updated references ready to be deployed
[21:31] * lizmat is ready to launch logging with the Raku based bot on the new channels: (for now they're just logged locally by yours truly, to be incorporated in the final logs later)
[21:31] <lizmat> jnthn is also aware of it
[21:33] <raydiak> speaking of RSC, next meeting was supposed to be over a month ago, but no minutes or other public information has been commited on github since April 6 covering the meeting on the 3rd
[21:34] <raydiak> erm, that wording got a bit twisted up, but you get my meaning I'm sure
[21:35] *** brtastic left
[21:35] <lizmat> raydiak: thanks for the nudge  :-)
[21:35] <raydiak> yw :)
[21:35] <lizmat> last weekend's meeting got cancelled because two members couldn't make it
[21:36] <lizmat> the minutes from the meeting before that should be published shortly
[21:36] <raydiak> thanks ++lizmat :)
[21:36] <lizmat> we're still learning to be a proper council  :-)
[21:43] <raydiak> I kinda wish there was more transparency there, the minutes are quite brief and (afaik) the public has no access to logs of actual conversations to understand the content and context. I can understand the need for discresion in certain specific cases, but in general it kinda gives things a "you aren't in the in-crowd" feeling, which I assume is very much the opposite of what we intend
[21:44] <raydiak> we used to talk about nearly everything out in the open on public IRC, but now the rooms are very quiet more often than I remember them being in years past. I get the impression that discussions and decisions both social and technical seem to happen...somehwere else
[21:44] <lizmat> well, the whole move from freenode to libera has only been discussed here on channel
[21:45] <lizmat> there's not been an official meeting / decision on that from the RSC
[21:45] <lizmat> so you could argue the actions taken so far have been actions of individuals who happen to be on the RSC
[21:45] <lizmat> raydiak: does that make sense ?
[21:46] <lizmat> once we are sure that we have control over the channels on libera.chat
[21:47] <lizmat> it makes sense to create a problem-solving issue and PR for people to comment / vote on
[21:48] <raydiak> yes I understand. but I'm not so focused on that one specific point now, as a general feeling that things around here may have changed and closed up a little bit in the years I was gone. it is completely possible that I'm mistaken and imagining things that aren't there, though
[21:48] <lizmat> it's a bit similar to: perhaps it's a good idea to use the "raku.foundation" domain to put a website of a Raku foundation
[21:48] <lizmat> but you better make sure you already have that domain, otherwise you won't  :-)
[21:49] <lizmat> well...  the rename has left deep scars
[21:50] <lizmat> since then, an individual made life for some core developers so stressfull, that they left the community for the most part for several months
[21:50] <lizmat> fortunately for us, they returned
[21:52] *** wamba left
[21:52] <raydiak> the one who was ejected from the RSC?
[21:52] <lizmat> indeed
[21:53] <lizmat> so, yes, things have changed a bit...
[21:55] <raydiak> that's useful context for me to at least start to understand, thank you. I keep romanticising about "glory days" when TimToady was around and everybody talked about everything in the same public channel because that's where he was
[21:55] <lizmat> well, that's the other thing
[21:56] <lizmat> TimToady, for all practical purposes, is no longer around
[21:56] <lizmat> jnthn is very hard trying to play the architect role
[21:57] <lizmat> pmichaud occasionally writes an answer on the mailing list
[21:57] <lizmat> very occasionally
[21:57] <raydiak> I keep wanting to ask why he's gone, but when he comes up a lot of people seem to get quiet, so I haven't asked
[21:57] <lizmat> and TheDamian has not been involved really for a *looong* time either
[21:58] <lizmat> in the end, you would need to ask him
[21:59] <lizmat> in my opinion: the naming issue and the community's reaction to the suggested alias, stressed TimToady completely into a burn-out
[21:59] <sienet_ja_LSD[m]> :o 
[22:00] <raydiak> that's actually a bit of a relief. I imagined serious medical issues or something
[22:00] <lizmat> raydiak: apart from his final consent to the name *change* after my problem-solving issue, I don't think he has looked at anything related to Perl / Raku or anything like that
[22:00] <lizmat> I've been told he doesn't look at his email
[22:01] *** dogbert11 joined
[22:02] <lizmat> I hope that TimToady will be able to come back at some point, but I'm working on the assumption that he's enjoying his well-earned retirement
[22:02] <lizmat> permanently
[22:02] <jdv79> i'm with raydiak in that it seems less stuff is public.  some of it might just be less peeps involved these days.
[22:02] <lizmat> perhaps "indefinitely" would be a better wording :-)
[22:03] <raydiak> lizmat: fair enough
[22:03] <lizmat> there are definitely fewer peeps involved
[22:03] <raydiak> yes, I have been trying to figure out how much of what I'm perceiving is a lack of activity, and how much of it is that some activity has moved to less open forums
[22:03] <lizmat> and some more of the old guard have basically left: masak moritz
[22:03] <lizmat> well, there's more production work going on:
[22:04] <lizmat> one of the reasons I've not been committing as much to the Rakudo core, is that I have been busy with setting up a website for Raku IRC logs
[22:04] <lizmat> https:://logs.liz.nl  shows the work so far
[22:05] <lizmat> https://logs.liz.nl  rather  :)
[22:05] *** dogbert17 left
[22:05] <lizmat> I hope to work that into a. a good utility for people interested in Raku, and b. a nice example of what you can do in Raku and Cro
[22:06] <jdv79> really?  masak and moritz are gone?  i've seen moritz around i think.
[22:06] <lizmat> and c. maybe have other communities use it as a solution for their IRC logging needs
[22:06] <lizmat> moritz is still around for sure, but not really involved in any day-to-day maint or development
[22:07] <lizmat> so yes, he's still around, but lurking
[22:07] <lizmat> same for masak to an extent, although he has to deal with the Great Wall of China to get onto IRC nowadays
[22:08] <lizmat> so that doesn't make things easier
[22:09] <jdv79> ouch
[22:09] <raydiak> I noticed masak's absence. looked him up on github, seemed like he was doing haskell and lisp and stuff. he always had some interesting takes on abstractions and metaprogramming and such. noticed moritz around here and there, but definitely not as much, was one of the various reasons I thought maybe activities had moved to less public places
[22:11] <lizmat> and the pandemic isn't helping: there basically hasn't been an in-person gathering since the conference in Riga in 2019
[22:12] <lizmat> that's now 21 months ago
[22:13] <lizmat> well, correction: some of us met at the GPW 2019, just before the lockddown
[22:13] <lizmat> so that's more like 14 months, but still
[22:14] <lizmat> brrt and samcv have been absorbed by $work, and/or other obligations
[22:14] <jdv79> people seem to disappear into booking
[22:14] <jdv79> like apple
[22:15] <lizmat> well, yes, been there, done that  :-)
[22:15] <jdv79> hah
[22:15] <lizmat> otoh, without booking, I wouldn't have been able to do what I have been doing for the past 9 years 
[22:15] <lizmat> ( I left on April 1, 2012)
[22:15] <jdv79> have a good night!  being told its dinner time&
[22:16] <raydiak> you'd think the pandemic would have had everybody at home contributing more, but I can see the lack of in-person "buzz" being a thing
[22:16] <raydiak> g'night jdv79 o/
[22:16] <raydiak> only ever made it to one conference in my life, but raku wasn't there. happened to be working events for a while in between real jobs in Austin when OSCON was there
[22:16] <lizmat> raydiak: good chance we met then ?
[22:20] <raydiak> I don't think so. always would have liked to meet y'all rakoons in person. as event crew, my participation was mostly limited to going out and saying hi at the tiny perl table for a few minutes on the first day
[22:21] <lizmat> well...  the tiny Perl table was "manned" by Wendy and me most of the time  :-)
[22:24] <raydiak> sadly I can't recall names or faces, but I'm pretty sure you weren't there, I was specifically looking for people I'd chatted with or I knew were involved in perl 6. I just remember there being a couple names I recognized from my perl 5 years but nobody I'd known personally, and talking to some very exuberant talkative guy :)
[22:24] *** lucasb joined
[22:25] <raydiak> it was really really early on, like we'd just laid the carpets and hung the drapes and moved in the furniture earlier that day
[22:25] <lizmat> ok, well, if there were people there, Wendy (woolfy) was probably one of them
[22:26] <Altreus> is rakoons an official name? :P
[22:29] <lizmat> it's what some people use. and what is used on /r/rakulang
[22:29] <lizmat> I like it :-)
[22:30] <lizmat> "A group of raccoon is formally known as a gaze or a nursery. Raccoons have somewhat complex social dynamics."
[22:30] <raydiak> lizmat: possibly. it would have been 4ish years ago, my memory of the brief encounter is quite vague. I don't think I'm familiar with her. I've heard people mention her, but I don't see her here. truth be told, this here is all I know of the people. I recognize you more by IRC handle than anything else :)
[22:31] <lizmat> woolfy burned out because of the continuous flak coming from the Perl community, and decided to call it a day after the rename
[22:32] <lizmat> having spent several years trying to promote Perl in general, and Perl 6 in particular, having to start over with a new name was too much for her
[22:33] <raydiak> I can see arguments either way with the name, and reasons to care, but it surprises me that people took it to such destructive extremes
[22:34] <Altreus> Wendy was always nice to me
[22:34] *** aborazmeh joined
[22:34] <Altreus> She gave me free Perl6 wine because FOSDEM was ending and there was loads left
[22:35] <lizmat> yeah.. that's just one exampleL what to do with "Perl 6" wine when the language is called "Raku"
[22:35] <Altreus> oh well it was perl6 back then
[22:36] <lizmat> we also still have piles of Perl 6 books in the basement, which are more and more becoming worth the price of paper
[22:36] <lizmat> not to mention the Perl books we still have :-(
[22:36] <Altreus> :(
[22:36] <Altreus> that must be frustrating
[22:36] <lizmat> or the fact that we still have the largest library of Perl books in the world
[22:37] <lizmat> and I walk past it every time I walk from the office to the kitchen and back
[22:37] <lizmat> yeah, frustrating and a constant reminder
[22:37] <Altreus> it may be advisable to relegate them to the forever bin
[22:38] <raydiak> why did we rename if there was so much adversity to it? just too much pressure from p5 people?
[22:39] <lizmat> choosing the least of two evils, really
[22:39] <lizmat> and I chose
[22:39] <Altreus> the pressure from both sides seeme fairly even to me, as a vague observer
[22:39] <lizmat> and in the end, people agreed with me
[22:40] <lizmat> well, most of them
[22:40] <lizmat> looking at recent events in the Perl community, I think it was the right choice
[22:42] <leont> Choosing the least of two evils does sound like an accurate description

[22:44] <lizmat> I recently described it as such:  "Raku *is* what the future of Perl *was*, Perl 7 is still Perl"
[22:46] <lizmat> and I feel, that also applies to the communities
[22:46] <lizmat> especially wrt Larry's view on re-making the community as well
[22:51] <leont> He has a skill for bringing people together
[22:52] <lizmat> anyways, I've just did a massive refactor of App::IRC::Log to prepare it for a real release, 
[22:52] <lizmat> and it's getting to 1am, so I'm going to sleep on it, and do the release tomorrow :-)
[22:52] <lizmat> sleep&
[22:53] <raydiak> thanks for the historical context lizmat. sleep well
