[18:02] <excalibor> greetings! I am starting a new project on gitgub and setting up a CI pipeline I found that after installing rakudo on the build agent, I don't have an easy way to fulfill dependencies... Is there anything I am not finding in «zef --help»? thanks!

[18:02] *** natrys joined
[18:03] *** reportable6 joined
[18:06] <moritz> excalibor: zef --install . # installs the current project and all its dependencies

[18:06] <moritz> erm, without the -- I think

[18:06] <excalibor> @moritz ah, great! I'll try that, thank you!

[18:13] <excalibor> okay, zef install . seems to do the job, but I don't yet have all the files, so it fails because the bin/program does not exist... :-D   I'll setup a small script to check for dependencies, no problem... I was wondering if there's something similar to python requirements.txt or javascript denpendencies.json... But it's not hard to do by hand...

[18:13] <excalibor> (y)

[18:13] <excalibor> gotta go, see you around, thanks for the help!

[18:19] <raydiak> if you're trying to list all the dependencies, you want 'zef depends .'. if you're trying to install the dependencies (but not the module itself), you're looking for 'zef install --deps-only .'

[23:32] <m6locks> running now

[23:32] <m6locks> failed to resolve some missing dependencies

[23:33] <m6locks> failed to find dot:from<bin>

[23:33] <softmoth> m6locks, oh, OK

[23:33] <softmoth> that's a dependency for ... Documentable, right?

[23:33] <m6locks> I think you're missing a colon

[23:33] <softmoth> I may need to include a stripped down Documentable, it's too finicky and I only need a tiny portion of it.

[23:34] <m6locks> oh sry no

[23:34] <softmoth> No, it's not a typo. It's depending on a system package
