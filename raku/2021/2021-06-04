[09:37] <raydiak> not sure whether to call that negative or complementary :)

[09:43] <Altreus> Take it as a complement

[09:44] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[09:50] <raydiak> was perhaps an overly-obscure logic joke. negation is also called the complement

[09:50] <raydiak> heh, raku's ! twigil is specifically mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark

[09:57] *** thundergnat left
[09:58] <Altreus> Perhaps my own pun ("Take it as a compliment") was itself obscure ;)

[09:58] <Altreus> maybe it was the same joke

[09:59] <Altreus> I approve of the Wikipedia article being exclamation mark, not exclamation point

[09:59] <raydiak> of course...you win this time :)

[10:01] *** perlmaros joined
[10:05] <lizmat> :-)

[10:07] <raydiak> if ! by itself is the complement of nothing, does that make it a concise expression of all possible things?

[10:09] <Altreus> It is easy to go from this concept to that of being overwhelmed to the point of wordlessness

[10:12] <raydiak> ...which takes us back to nothing

[10:12] <raydiak> this is why empty text files and blank paper give me writer's block. I immediately realize it simultaneously represents nothing and the possibility of all things. then I need a nap :)

[10:13] <Altreus> Imagination requires constraints

[10:14] <Altreus> I should say s/Imagination/Creativity/

[10:19] <raydiak> creating a defined thing does imply that it's defined as not some other thing

[10:21] *** bdju left
[10:21] <Altreus> You shouldn't open the file or take up the paper until you have spontaneously imagined a constraint in which to work

[10:22] *** bdju joined
[10:23] <raydiak> or not do it at all, which apparently is the least destructive thing possible

[10:24] <Altreus> And the least constructive

[10:24] <Altreus> If you choose inaction you still have made a choice

[10:25] <raydiak> but the possibilities from that point are endless, which doesn't sound like a bad point to be at

[10:26] <Altreus> At rock bottom, the only way is up

[10:30] <raydiak> I wouldn't call inaction rock bottom. often our first compulsion is to do something which ends up making a situation worse. in other words up is not the only way to go from rock bottom if you pull out a jackhammer

[15:21] <Woodi> hi

[15:23] <Woodi> just upgraded Debian host and "perl6-*" packages was *very* slow to upgrade... probably it is like that since few years. maybe packaging could be improved ?

[15:23] <Woodi> probably related to zef and modules

[15:24] * Woodi assumes "perl6-*" are Raku but just naming...

[15:25] <El_Che> Woodi: I offer this as an alternative https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[15:25] <El_Che> (if you need a more recent pkg)

[15:26] <nine> Woodi: is there an open Debian bugreport on this? I seem to remember them doing precompilation in a post-install script which is just not how it's meant to be done. Precompilation should be done as part of packaging and it'd be about time they fix this

[15:27] <Woodi> nine: possible

[15:28] <Woodi> El_Che: sorry, but I prefer distros packages or compiling from sources. except on Windows I totally do not care :)

[15:30] <El_Che> Woodi: no sorry, just a pointer :)

[19:44] <m6locks> ok guise

[19:44] <m6locks> how does Comma's projects structure work?

[19:45] <m6locks> I created a project with a .pm6 file in the lib/ directory, there's a .p6 file in the bin/ directory

[19:46] <m6locks> but when I do raku Peli.p6 it says could not find the .pm6 file

[19:49] <tonyo> do raku -Ilib Peli.p6

[19:50] <m6locks> nope, still the same error

[19:50] <tonyo> what's your code look like?  the `-I` flag is adding that directory to the module search path

[19:51] <m6locks> it's literally 3 lines

[19:51] <tonyo> oh now i know what they are.

[19:53] <m6locks> the basic setup for a project does use module (in my case Kasino.pm6 is the module file name, use Kasino;) and the I create a class and try to say the class contents

[19:54] <m6locks> the module name lib/Kasino.pm6 is listed in the META6.json file thee

[19:54] <m6locks> +r

[19:54] <tonyo> in your Kasino.pm6 you have either `module Kasino` or `class Kasino` ?

[19:54] <m6locks> ah, no

[19:54] <m6locks> trying

[19:55] <m6locks> I added the module Kasino; line in Kasino.pm6 but no

[19:55] <m6locks> still the same error 

[19:56] <tonyo> with the -I flag?

[19:56] <m6locks> aye, with the -I flag

[19:57] <gfldex> m6locks: `raku -e 'say $*CWD;'` might help

[19:58] <m6locks> it's the /bin dir

[19:58] <gfldex> try -I../lib then

[19:58] <tonyo> ^

[19:59] <m6locks> ah, now it does something

[19:59] <m6locks> thank you

[20:02] <m6locks> should I do java-style one-class-in-one-pm6-file or how does that work?

[20:02] <m6locks> it's now saying Undeclare name although I have a class of that name in the pm6

[20:02] <m6locks> +d

[20:02] <gfldex> did you export it?

[20:03] <m6locks> hmm no

[20:03] <tonyo> m6locks: https://gist.github.com/tony-o/ffb28eaad98f8efd31c8e162949fd2e7

[20:04] *** linkable6 left
[20:04] *** evalable6 left
[20:04] <m6locks> it appears the naming convention would need to have the module name in fron of the class name

[20:05] *** linkable6 joined
[20:06] *** evalable6 joined
[20:08] <tonyo> if you have a class embedded in a module then yes

[20:08] <m6locks> yes, now it works

[20:09] <m6locks> what about classes as method arguments, it says invalid typename 

[20:10] <m6locks> (I'm literally re-doing an old Java project in Raku)

[20:11] <lizmat> m: class Foo { };  sub a(Foo $b) { dd $b }; a Foo

[20:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «Foo␤»

[20:11] <lizmat> m6locks: we need more to go on :-)

[20:11] <tonyo> if you want the entire file to be a class then use `unit class Kasino;` at the top of the file rather than putting the lcass inside a module

[20:12] <m6locks> do I need to add the Kasino:: in front of the class name in the argument field?

[20:12] <m6locks> they are both found in the same unit module

[20:12] <m6locks> the classes that is

[20:12] <tonyo> you want the class itself as an argument or you want a typed parameter?

[20:13] <m6locks> it's just a type, yes

[20:13] <tonyo> m: class A {has $.x = 5; }; sub say-a(A $x) { dd $x; }; say-a(A.new);

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «A.new(x => 5)␤»

[20:14] <m6locks> hmm

[20:16] <tonyo> m: class A {has $.x = 5; }; sub say-a(A $x) { dd $x; }; say-a(A);

[20:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «A␤»

[20:16] <tonyo> m: class A {has $.x = 5; }; sub say-a(A:D $x) { dd $x; }; say-a(A);

[20:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «Parameter '$x' of routine 'say-a' must be an object instance of type␤'A', not a type object of type 'A'.  Did you forget a '.new'?␤  in sub say-a at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:16] <tonyo> m: class A {has $.x = 5; }; sub say-a(A:D $x) { dd $x; }; say-a(A.new);

[20:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «A.new(x => 5)␤»

[20:22] <raydiak> I'm with lizmat on this one: it would help a lot if we could see the code in a gist or pastebin or something so we know exactly how things are arranged and declared instead of playing 20 questions :)

[20:22] <m6locks> just a sec

[20:24] <m6locks> https://dpaste.com/2RE2HEY8N

[20:24] <m6locks> that's the two files in one paste

[20:25] <lizmat> X::AdHox   looks like a typo for X::AdHoc ?

[20:26] <m6locks> I can fix it, it's not complaining about that tho

[20:26] <lizmat> @!pino = Array.new;   # is a noop, you can remove that line

[20:26] <m6locks> aye, good

[20:26] <m6locks> my error is Invalid typename 'Kortti' in parameter declaration.

[20:27] <m6locks> row 66 in the paste 

[20:27] <lizmat> Kortti inside Kasino::Pino is short for Kasino::Pino::Kortti

[20:28] <lizmat> which doesn't exist

[20:28] <lizmat> so you should fully qualify it inside Kasino::Pino

[20:29] <m6locks> aye, yes that seems to do the trick

[20:29] <m6locks> thank you

[21:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89fd8a8df: OUTPUT: «(not-hidden)␤»

[22:28] <kraxn> hi there. New to raku - i just installed raku for ubuntu, using "sudo apt-get install rakudo" via https://rakudo.org/downloads. To get the repl, I can use 'Perl6', but most examples use 'raku'. Did I miss something in the configuration? In addition I also tried to use 'zef' to install a package, but it wasn't recognised. Did I miss something on the

[22:28] <kraxn> install here too? 

[22:43] <juanfra> kraxn, do you have the file "/usr/share/perl6/site/bin/zef"?

[22:44] <phogg> kraxn: per packages.ubuntu.org there is a package called perl6-zef, maybe that's it

[22:44] <phogg> s/org/com

[22:45] <juanfra> if he installed raku using the packages from rakudo.org, then he shouldn't install the zef package from the ubuntu repo

[22:46] <kraxn> juanfra - no I don't, phogg: sorry, I working from Linux. I just realised I i didn't install the star bundle, would this have the modules I need? 

[22:47] <phogg> kraxn: probably best to ignore me

[22:48] <kraxn> phogg: no worries, any help is appreciated!

[22:49] <m6locks> aye,  star has modules

[22:50] <kraxn> thanks, I will give this a shot now.

[22:52] <juanfra> kraxn, ok, i think i understand now. you just ran the command "sudo apt-get install rakudo" because rakudo.org says that. you are using the official ubuntu package then. try installing perl6-zef as phogg said

[22:53] <juanfra> i thought that rakudo had some kind of official rakudo build for ubuntu.

[22:53] <phogg> it might have had that, but I guess not

[23:01] <m6locks> well it is confusing tbh, since the webpage says that rakudo moar includes zef (implying you could install modules with it)

[23:02] <m6locks> rakubrew worked nice for me

[23:03] <tonyo> if the ubuntu package comes without zef then zef's readme has how to install it naturally
