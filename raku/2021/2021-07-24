[19:00] <CIAvash> Altai-man, patrickb: The pgp key for rakudo binaries seems to have changed from Patrick BÃ¶ker to Alexander Kiryuhin, should I add the new key (FE750D152426F3E50953176ADE8F8F5E97A8FCDE) to the valid pgp keys?

[19:03] <Altai-man> CIAvash, yes

[19:04] <Altai-man> CIAvash, for the reference, that's me and I did releases for last 20 times or something.

[19:04] <CIAvash> Yeah, I know. Just wanted to be sure.

[19:07] <CIAvash> rakudo-bin 2021.07 is now available on AUR.

[19:10] <Altai-man> CIAvash++ # thank you very much for doing this!

[19:11] <CIAvash> Altai-man++ patrickb++ too
