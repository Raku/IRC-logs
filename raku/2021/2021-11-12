[09:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik#7370> it's not really interesting if you just show a problem solve by just a function call and his opinion is super subjective

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Encounpled with claims like "GCD should have a built-in function"

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> How many of us have ever used GCD in a program?

[09:31] <moon-child> m: say 12 gcd 18

[09:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3d80bec7c: OUTPUT: ¬´6‚ê§¬ª

[09:31] <moon-child> what's the problem?

[09:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik#7370> I mean gcd should be in the math lib I guess, but I don't think I will use it one day x)

[09:31] <moon-child> why should it be in a math library if it's built-in?

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in general

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not about Raku

[09:33] <moon-child> oh, I see.  Don't most languages have such a function?

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> languages with stronger emphasis on math usually do

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I think many mainstream languages actually don't

[09:34] <moon-child> weird

[09:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but like... not that it actually matters xD

[09:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there will be a lib for it even if it's not built-in

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik#7370> Is there some use of gcd outside doing math stuff? like for some algo?

[09:36] <moon-child> what is 'math stuff'?  Is indexing an array math stuff?

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> good question... probably less than for sine and cosine which _are_ usually built-in

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I can only say I haven't come across GCD in real-world problems ever

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> for example, I had to implement an ad-hoc topological sort once üòÑ

[19:45] <tib> Hello all, the ephemeral miniconf is coming in less than one week now. The Raku side of it has shrinked despite my will but still it could be interesting for you all. It is Thursday 18th November (next Thursday then) and it starts at 3pm Paris time then UTC +1 currently (means morning in us and very late in Asia/Australia). To give an idea it starts at same time TPRCIC was. 

[19:46] <tib> https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-connection-infos-1dmb

[19:46] <tib> Meeting ID: 818 6906 5466

[19:47] <tib> There are multiple experienced speakers talking about devops/github/ldap/etc‚Ä¶

[19:49] <tib> Single day, single track, Perl, Raku and fun

[20:17] <moritz_> tbrowder: I think jjmerelo occasionally updates it manually

[20:18] <tbrowder> i see the code in doc master and i really could use it now :-(

[20:20] <tbrowder> oh, well, thnx moritz, i really wish we could automate it again. sad to say, but i don't think Documetable was completed sufficiently to be used for the docs.

[21:27] <[Coke]> with recent rakudo I had to hit ^C twice to exit, then I had to run 'stty sane' to get my terminal back

[21:31] <codesections> S///, and /re/ and Str.trans all (can) operate on a regex.  Does tr/// only take literal strings?  (I'd always thought it took a regex and then was confused when changing something from $_ .= trans to tr/// changed the output

[22:07] <japhb> And on which OS?

[22:25] <[Coke]> mac

[22:25] <[Coke]> how do I tell which line editor?

[22:25] <[Coke]> It's probably readline, that's what I'd install if they prompted me to pick one

[23:05] *** gabiruh_ is now known as gabiruh

[23:34] <japhb> [Coke]: OK, and you're using the standard Terminal app?

[23:34] <japhb> Hmmm, come to think of it I don't thing that gets debug output at all.  You can check which ones you have installed by doing a `zef info` on Linenoise, Readline, and Terminal::LineEditor.
