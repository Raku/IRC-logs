[00:01] <torbjorn> yes, I tried the debugger. It doesn't really offer anything in addition to the Tracer, as far as I can see, I can't really hit the enter key 754 times to get to the end. it offers to run till rule <name>, but I have only tokens, not rules (if that matters), at least its not stopping on any of my named tokens

[00:01] <torbjorn> the last line I see is: * MATCH "Module #0\n\tName: module-device-restore\n\tArgument:\n\tUsage cou"

[00:02] <torbjorn> If I had seen the last of that long string , I think that might have helped me, but, like I said, this is 28kb long

[05:34] <guifa2> class Language (from LanguageTag::Language) and an enum-y package Language

[05:34] <guifa2> I guess the best would be to require the package LanguageTag::Language and then leave the enumy one as the simple Language but ‚Ä¶ me

[05:34] <guifa2> meh*

[05:35] <moon-child> put the enum inside of the class

[05:36] * moon-child excels at bad advice

[05:37] <guifa2> I mean‚Ä¶¬†it's not bad.  It kind of works, but then basically requires the enums (and there's a LOT of them) so it's mandatory extra

[06:47] <guifa2> the TIO one is about one year old.  Most everything you can try should work okay in it with the main exceptions of the COERCE method on classes and .raku is still only .perl

[06:48] <guifa2> you can also try out https://perl6.github.io/6pad/

[06:48] <guifa2> https://glot.io/new/raku

[06:48] <guifa2> and https://repl.it/languages/raku

[06:48] <guifa2> All of them have AFAIK versions within the past year

[06:58] <Petya> guifa2, Many thanks! Will try. BTW the link to glot.io on https://raku.org/resources/ leads to the old perl6 page and returns an error

[13:59] <PimDaniel> Suppose i have an instance object : my $obj = Thing.new, now i want it into a list: if i write : @liste[0] := $obj; i wach, that push @liste,$obj does not attach the object but makes a copy of it but dealing with indices is really borring and i don't need them. How to push an object?

[13:59] <PimDaniel> I mean an object linked not copied.

[14:02] <lizmat> what makes you think it is copied?

[14:02] <lizmat> in any case: @list.push($obj) ?

[14:03] * PimDaniel lizmat : It does not remains in original object.

[14:04] <PimDaniel> In other words : i thought it would act like a pointer. But no.

[14:07] <lizmat> PimDaniel: feels to me you're worrying about things you shouldn't worry about?

[14:07] <PimDaniel> So i need to make atomic tests on my objects because i'm even not sure of what is going wrong.

[14:07] <lizmat> I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve or debug

[14:08] <PimDaniel> A 2D plan called screen which is a class of points.

[14:09] <PimDaniel> The only goal is to access any points faster.

[14:10] <PimDaniel> So it user a 2D buffer.

[14:10] <PimDaniel> it *uses

[14:11] <PimDaniel> the problem is if you put points into a list, each time you search a point to search informations of that point, you need to loop.

[14:12] <PimDaniel> Well List or Array.Voil√†.

[17:37] <summerisle> has it ever been suggested that, in a scenario where `role Role[::T] {*}` is defined as well as `role Role[Concrete] {*}` that methods from [::T] be inherited by [Concrete] rather than having effectively distinct implementations?

[17:38] *** aluaces joined
[17:38] <summerisle> currently you have to create a mixin role to provide common implementations and it can be a tad messy

[18:20] <jmerelo> So any help is welcome

[18:21] <summerisle> hm

[18:21] <ugexe> which would delegate any methods to T from Foo that T has

[18:22] <ugexe> it is not implemented though

[20:33] <brown121407> Hi! I'm trying to play with some raku modules but when installing Cro with zef, I get this: Cannot locate native library 'libssl.so': libssl.so

[20:34] <brown121407> I have openssl on my system

[20:35] <brown121407> Might it be because I'm using Guix as a package manager and libssl.so is actually at /gnu/store/ixm51m1jcfw4rhvwnd690szfv2w3pcsm-openssl-1.1.1j/lib/libssl.so ?

[20:40] <vrurg> brown121407: most likely it is. I don't know how Guix works and how the rest of the system finds the libs, but I'd find out about this first. Also, look at LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as a quick "patch".
