[05:28] <keutoi> Is syntax of NQP a subset of Raku?
[05:29] <keutoi> Will every nqp program syntax check Ok with `rakudo -Mnqp -c` ?
[05:29] <moon-child> hm, not sure if it is a strict subset.  #raku-dev may be more helpful.  But I will note that raku syntax highlighting works pretty well for nqp
[05:37] <keutoi> Hmm, It doesnt' seem to be so. I just tried an example which complained undeclared routine `subst`.
[05:38] <keutoi> I was trying to see if `flycheck-raku` could be modified to syntax-check `nqp` files by just adding `-Mnqp` option to the `raku -c` command invocation.
[05:38] <keutoi> Does nqp have syntax check option?

[06:20] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[06:25] <moritz_> sure, go ahead
[06:26] <yjh> I was trying to install Digest::SHA1::Native which uses NativeCall.  It uses
[06:27] <yjh> constant SHA1 = %?RESOURCEDS<libraries/sha1>;
[06:27] <yjh> which it passes to is native ( SHA1 ) { * }
[06:27] <yjh> when trying to build it, I got 
[06:27] <yjh> Cannot locate native library 'C:\Users\Public\test\raku\sha1\resources/libraries/sha1.lib': error 0xc1
[06:28] <yjh> when changing it to constant SHA1 = <absolute path with forward slashes here>, I was able to build it.
[06:28] <yjh> (on windows)
[06:30] <yjh> sorry, that should read %?RESOURCES<libraries/sha1>;
[06:39] <yjh> Please let me know if I can provide any more information or if it looks like I have something set up wrong.

[09:04] <holyghost> I've written Game::Quest v0.1.4, a Game kit for old Sierra Quest games such as King's quest, space quest. If you override Room, Player and Quest you can make them. Needs a collision system and a keyboard interface for making games out of it.
[09:09] <holyghost> keyboard input without mouse for talking can be done by a fuzzy associative matrix

[13:12] <dwhk> I'm looking for a raku equivalent to Module::Starter and found App::Assixt.  So I tried `zef install App::Assixt` but that throws an error: "[App::Assixt] Please note that a 'META6.json' file was found in '.', of which the 'provides' section was used to determine if a dependency is available or not.  Perhaps you need to add 'App::Assixt::Test' in
[13:12] <dwhk> the <provides> section of that file?  Or need to specify a directory that does *not* have a 'META6.json' file?"  What do I do next?  zef install worked fine for other modules.
[13:12] <lizmat> dwhk: you probably want to have a look at App::Mi6
[13:14] <dwhk> lizmat: thanks.  that installed without problems.  I will try it out.

[15:05] <holyghost> v0.1.5 of Game::Quest has been uploaded, it has a BAM (bi-assoc matrix) system for parsing "look at" in a row and "body" in a column then firing an action (func for now)
[15:06] <holyghost> Then there's a LoopObject class for having in-game movies/non-keyb input game loops
[15:06] <holyghost> or anything like that, it should just be an SDL loop
[15:07] <holyghost> the thing is based on the SDL package
[15:08] <holyghost> Everything is left to clean code so you can jam about your games, and as someone told me, you better write scenarios :-)
[15:09] <holyghost> the BAM is based on a hacker's understanding of an old Sierra text interface. You type "look at room" not "I want to look at the room"
[15:09] <holyghost> It was made on a mac 11
[15:11] <holyghost> If you grok the raku SDL package, you're set for making old Sierra adeventure games
[15:11] <holyghost> I've not put any examples in it
[15:13] <holyghost> anyway, SDL events understanding should help
[15:14] <holyghost> Game::Quest should be usable right now, I'll see what I can add later on
