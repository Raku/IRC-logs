[12:06] <gfldex> ohh, I atually meant X,
[12:07] <timo> that makes sense :D

[12:09] <timo> SmokeMachine: is there any way to generate stuff in multiple models from just one factory? like create a post in the posts table and a bunch of tags to go with it in the tags table or something?
[12:09] <timo> doesn't seem like factory is set up to handle more than one model though

[12:18] <SmokeMachine> (if you have a `@.posts` relationship on Person)

[13:49] <timo> does factory-args $num-of-posts, "post" know that .posts is an array relationship and the first argument is how many of the model "post" it will create?
[13:50] <timo> or rather from the factory "post"

[14:09] <SmokeMachine> timo: almost that... if you call factory-args with a int and any factory name it will return an array with `factors-args("post") xx $num-of-posts`
[14:16] <timo> nice
[14:16] <timo> so just factory-args Str:D, *@foo *%bar vs factory-args Int:D, Str:D, *@foo, *%bar

[14:43] <Xliff> Yes
[14:43] <timo> the majority of classes you'll encounter are based on Any, which derives from Mu

[22:02] <japhb> Skarsnik: when you match against a grammar using .parse, it's implicitly anchored to the start and end, IIRC.

[22:05] *** nebuchadnezzar joined
[22:06] <Skarsnik> What I mean is the code is stuck in parse but it matched an instruction (I made is parse 'lda 42') according to Grammar::Tracer, but it just does no go futher
[22:08] <japhb> What are you expecting it to parse next?  A comment, or an additional instruction, or ...?
[22:09] <Skarsnik> nothing, just stop

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so it keeps hanging?

[22:19] <Skarsnik> lda rules does not work properly anyways, I tried with a just simple rtl (token instruction:sym<rtl> {'rtl'}) this match properly but again, it stop trying matching stuff and hang
[22:45] <Skarsnik> hu, if I replace the <.ws>* by \s* this work correctly

[23:15] <Skarsnik> Yes, I can read the doc, but I still don't get it while replacing with just \s* works. like 'lda' <.ws>* <ABSOLUTE> does not work, but 'lda' \s* <ABSOLUTE> work and we are outside the word (lda) after the lda string match

[23:21] <evalable6> Skarsnik, rakudo-moar c39660dea: OUTPUT: ¬´(signal SIGHUP) ¬´timed out after 10 seconds¬ª¬ª
[23:21] <Skarsnik> why does that even timeout xD
[23:22] <japhb> Skarsnik: Do you need to quantify <.ws> at all?  I believe it is already internally quantified, which means you're effectively doing zero-or-more of zero-or-more, and then ... infinite loop
[23:22] <Skarsnik> Hooo
[23:22] <Skarsnik> right x)
[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so apparently neither of us can read the doc ü§£
[23:23] <Skarsnik> (maybe this should warn or something)
[23:23] <japhb> timo: Google's emoji team drew all the combos by hand for a feature in their messaging products.

[23:24] <timo> *damn* that must be a *lot* of work
[23:24] <japhb> Oh yeah.
[23:25] <timo> i thought this was using some algorithmic approach, which would have been mind-blowing
[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like... regex ws { <!ww> \s* }
[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> \s* be like
[23:25] <timo> but hand-made is also good
[23:25] <japhb> ISTR they did them in blocks of like 300-400 combos with each point release or somesuch.
[23:25] *** squashable6 joined
[23:25] <timo> a lot of creativity on display here
[23:25] <perryprog> oh my goodness https://tikolu.net/emojimix/ü§î+ü§î
[23:25] <japhb> Yeah, definitely.
[23:25] <perryprog> a lot of the ones for combining two of the same are really good
[23:25] <Skarsnik> perryprog, nice one :)
[23:26] <Skarsnik> Ok tommorow is fun time: generating all the instruction token :)
