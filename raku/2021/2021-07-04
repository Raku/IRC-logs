[22:32] <tbrowder> happy indepence day for any americans in the room!

[22:32] *** happy-dude joined
[22:34] <tbrowder> i need to represent a hex number with fractional parts. so far i can only do that as a string, e.g., "0x10.1"

[22:35] <tbrowder> m: my $x = '0x10.1'; say $x.^name

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «Str␤»

[22:35] <tbrowder> m: my $x=0x10.1

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed postfix call␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my $x=0x10.7⏏051␤»

[22:37] <tbrowder> m: my $s='0x10.1'; my $x = $s.Num; say $x

[22:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «16.0625␤»

[22:38] <tbrowder> m: my $x=(0x10.1); $x.^name

[22:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed postfix call␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my $x=(0x10.7⏏051); $x.^name␤»

[22:39] *** abraxxa-home joined
[22:39] <tbrowder> is there any way with fancy quotes to assign the real hex number without its string representation?

[22:41] <tbrowder> m: my $x=<<0x10.1>>

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: ( no output )

[22:42] <tbrowder> m: my $x=<<0x10.1>>; say $x.^name

[22:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «RatStr␤»

[22:43] <tbrowder> aha!

[22:44] <elcaro> m: say :16<10.1>

[22:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «16.0625␤»

[22:44] <rassoc> was about to write that; saw it here: https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S02-literals/radix.t

[22:46] <rassoc> m: say "ab  cd  ef".split(/<ws>/)

[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «( ab  cd  ef )␤»

[22:46] <rassoc> m: say "ab  cd  ef".split(/<ws>+/)

[22:46] <rassoc> is this supposed to hang?

[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 104187424 bytes␤»

[22:47] <elcaro> that MoarVM looks like a panic. will need to be traced with gdb or something. but the correct way to do what you want is...

[22:47] <elcaro> m: say "aa  cc    ed".words

[22:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «(aa cc ed)␤»

[22:48] <rassoc> sure, know that, just stumbled upon the above in a unrelated situation

[23:13] *** abraxxa-home left
[23:19] <tbrowder> elcaro: i'm trying something a bit different. i'm trying to create a list of numbers for testing representing various formats they might appear as in the wild

[23:21] <tbrowder> the only ones that cause a bit of trouble so far are the hex, binary, and octal representations. i'm trying to avoid using a pure string repr

[23:27] <rassoc> m: :16<10.1>.WHAT 

[23:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: ( no output )

[23:27] <rassoc> m: :16<10.1>.WHAT.say

[23:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2542a0ac4: OUTPUT: «(Rat)␤»
