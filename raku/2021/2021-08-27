[09:39] <keutoi> Is `=begin overview` part of Pod6? I cannot seem to find any documentation for it.

[09:41] <keutoi> Hmm, So any identifier can follow `=begin`

[09:56] <Altreus> I find pod6 far less intuitive than pod5

[18:36] <melezhik> Hi!  I spruced https://sparrowhub.io/ up, adding more code examples (Raku) and clarifying connection between Sparrow/SparrowHub and Raku. I'd appreciate if Raku people tell me if it makes more sense now 

[18:36] <lizmat> melezhik++

[18:37] <melezhik> or maybe what other plugin examples they might want to see on the front page

[18:39] <melezhik> still fixing bugs with the front page ... plugin example get shown all , instead of only for Git category 

[18:41] *** Altai-man joined
[18:42] <melezhik> yeah, finally fixed that )))

[18:43] <melezhik> looks good to me now

[18:49] <melezhik> finally I've changed a slogan, to " SparrowHub - Raku plugins for daily $work " which is much closer to real state of the system

[18:50] <lizmat> :-)

[18:55] <melezhik> however it always dissonance even for me, Raku plugins ( get run as Raku functions ) that could be written on other languages :] :')

[21:58] <pisa> hiÔºåwhen use  matach object's method: replace-with, it says "no such method"!

[21:59] <pisa> https://docs.raku.org/routine/replace-with

[22:02] <pisa> sorry for match typo,  it's match object.

[22:04] <lizmat> m: say "Some foo".match(/foo/).replace-with("bar")

[22:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar c0a6823b0: OUTPUT: ¬´Some bar‚ê§¬ª

[22:04] <lizmat> looks ok to me?

[22:11] <lizmat> pisa: which version of Raku are you using?

[22:12] <pisa> This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11

[22:12] <pisa> implementing Perl 6.d.

[22:12] <pisa> rakudo -v says above.

[22:14] <lizmat> yeah, that's too old

[22:14] <lizmat> it got added in 2020.02

[22:16] <pisa> o, thanks.  i need manual install rakudo.  ubuntu's apt source need update.
