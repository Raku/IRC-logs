[12:52] <mscha> Isn't this wrong?  The doc says: method to()

[18:08] <CIAvash> no it's correct, it needs to be written as `$s.substr($m.from ..^ $m.to)`, because `$m.to` is the last position of the match

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Where the talks can be submitted?

[18:59] *** linkable6 joined
[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Meaning, should it be done through the FOSDEM22 system or someone from "the Raku team" have to be emailed?

[19:00] *** p6steve left
[19:04] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: ideally you should get a login on pentabarf

[19:04] <lizmat> if that is troublesome, you could let me know a gist of what you want to do, and I'll try to enter it on your behalf

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> lizmat: Thank you for the clarification! I was preparing for JJ Merelo efforts in "Advent of Code" an article on "Data wrangling with Raku." I am terribly late with article, but it might become a good talk.

[19:12] <lizmat> it could well be both  :-)

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Ah! Ok, I will try to finish this weekend then...

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> lizmat: Also, thank you for implementing the terribly needed and useful `Acme::Text::UpsideDown` !!

[19:15] * lizmat had forgotten all about it :-)

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Well, I submitted and issue I have on GitHub...

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Well, I submitted an issue I have on GitHub...

We start with a general discussion on data wrangling's place in data science and why that influenced the choice of data structures that are easily interpreted in tabular data format and, the same time, natively repre

[19:29] <tonyo> i'll do a write up on how to use it

[19:30] <tonyo> but in the meantime the commands are in fez and the gist of roles are `admin|member`, admin can add/remove users and modify the role, members cannot.  both can upload 

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> lizmat: I will make a dedicated GitHub page for that presentation / document later today.

[19:31] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: looking forward to int

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I got interested recently in the macOS and iOS app called Siri Shortcuts. I am interested in utilizing it with Raku. I can call scripts from Shortcuts, so in principle Raku scripts should be easy to invoke. But Shortcuts also uses a a protocol called "x-callback-url"  -- see (http://x-callback-url.com) -- which allows queries like this: `targetapp://x-callback-url/updateStatus?x-source=SourceApp&text=[Us
