[16:32] <codesections> makes sense.  Of course, you can always .grep and then .map, but that gets a bit longer

[18:24] <moritz> nice, I got my first one 4 weeks ago, so still waiting for the second

[18:24] <tadzik> sweet :)

[18:24] * sjn thought Util's talk yesterday was pretty good, so I posted a link to it on /r/ProgrammingLanguages :-) --> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/nvjdx8/video_raku_the_big_perl_raku_conference_in_the/

[18:24] <tadzik> should be any day now then, right?

[18:25] <moritz> tadzik: nah, the recommended time betwen the shots is *at least* 6 weeks, better to wait 10-12 weeks for max efficacy

[18:25] <tadzik> oh, interesting

[18:25] <tadzik> is that for biontech?

[18:26] <tadzik> my little leaflet says "recommended 2nd dose 3 weeks later", ended up being roughly a month later

[18:27] <moritz> huh

[18:27] <moritz> so the German official recommendation for biontech is 6 weeks, and for AZ it's 6 to 12 weeks

[18:27] <tadzik> right, AZ is waiting a few months over here too

[18:28] <moritz> afaict all the clinical trials were done with relatively short time between the shots, and later data showed better results with more time between them

[18:28] <moritz> my first shot was AZ, trying to get biontech for the second

[18:29] <tadzik> oh, I didn't even know you could mix them ‚Äì but why not, I suppose

[18:29] <tadzik> here it isn't an option, you signup for 2 doses of the same thing (unless it's No More Tears obviously)

[18:29] <moritz> well, stuff's complicated due to the changes in EMA recommendations

[18:30] <moritz> early on, AZ was only recommended for those <60yo, now it's only recommended for those >60yo

[18:30] <moritz> so younger folks first vaccinated with AZ get a second short with an mRNA vaccine, without any prior trials (but experts said it's plausible it works well)

[18:31] <tadzik> huh

[18:31] <moritz> and data from those cases suggests that it works better than two doses of AZ, and with around 12 weeks between them, roughly equals 2x biontech

[19:43] <nine> yes

[19:45] <codesections> I just sat in on a Perl conf talk about how Perl devs can transition to a new language (as Perl jobs become harder to find) and it made "learning a new language" sound like a huge undertaking (something like a 6 month project).  I would have thought that an experienced dev would (1) already have 3+ langs under their belt and (2) be able to pick up a language like JS or Go in ~week or so.  Am I way off base?

[19:47] <ugexe> syntax sure

[19:48] <jdv> productively and idiomatically - 1w seems unrealistic

[19:48] <tadzik> the deutscher call it biontech even though pfizer sounds more deutsch :P

[19:49] <tadzik> I've no idea why, but I learned it from moritz++ on twitter so I adapt in conversations :P

[19:49] <codesections> yeah, jdv that's fair 

[19:49] <stoned75_> well 6 months is not much, compared to the 10 years required to learn programming ;-) http://norvig.com/21-days.html

[19:49] <tadzik> ah, that's because the EU company is actually called biontech?

[19:50] <tadzik> Pfizer is just the "publisher" afaiui

[19:50] <tadzik> makes sense

[19:57] <El_Che> ah

[19:58] <El_Che> thx for the background

[19:58] <codesections> Yeah.  But precisely because there _is_ so much to learn in programming, the skills seem very transferable.  I had to write some JS recently, and felt like I could write better JS now than I could when I worked full time in the langugae

[19:59] <codesections> even though I hadn't otherwise touched JS in 2+ years

[20:03] <raydiak_> imo it depends heavily on where you put the "done learning" finish line. you can generally learn the syntax and semantics in a short time, yes. but knowing all the corners and quirks and how to avoid the common traps, core libraries, other common libraries, etc is a very differnt thing, not to mention if you have to interact heavily with the community, being aware of the cultural norms and conventions which can

[20:03] <raydiak_> vary widely between languages. you can learn JS, but then do you know all the DOM manipulation functions? jQuery and/or some other popular framework(s)? have you memorized or are at least aware of the messes like this: https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/ ? what about cross-browser inconsistencies? do you know enough to recognize and avoid javascript from the 90s copy-and-paste sites? that's a lot

[20:03] <raydiak_> to learn, or even become aware of these various corners, and none of that transfers to another language

[20:04] <stoned75_> I'm looking at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/09d755cbe1d604d81c13e928b37f123aa17667ca

[20:04] <codesections> Yeah, I *generally* agree.  I mentioned Go and JS on purpose because those issues seem smaller there

[20:05] <stoned75_> it means that Rat and FatRat have the same domain

[20:05] <stoned75_> right ?

[20:05] <stoned75_> as they both use Int as denominator, since 2012 !

[20:06] <codesections> DOM manipulation is less relevant if you're building React (or similar) apps, and irrelevant all together for backend JS (presumably where most Perl devs would want to be?)

[20:07] <codesections> And given that most shops use prettier.js, codding conventions aren't as relevant as the used to be

[20:07] <gfldex> The dominating factor is the brain in question.

[20:10] <jdv> a web dev that doesn't know dom - eek

[20:10] <jdv> shoudn'

[20:11] <jdv> t be playing with react then probably

[20:11] <codesections> well, I don't think *my* brain is anything special.  So maybe I'm underestimating the task!

[20:11] <raydiak_> you were asking about time it takes to learn a language. the currnet state of javascript is completely beside my point, unless I've missed something

[20:13] <raydiak_> maybe it's not the DOM you have to learn, maybe it's some other set of manipulations. which really only further points to the fact that two people can think they "know" javascript, and know very different and separate things. whether you do or don't "know" something as broad as a language, community, and ecosystem is pretty subjective

[20:13] <codesections> raydiak_: well, I said a language "like Go or JS".  Learning Rust definitely took me 6+ months, but I was coming from JS and had never worked in a statically typed lang

[20:14] <jdv> does anyone really "know" raku?...:)

[20:14] <MasterDuke34> stoned75_: look at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Rat.pm6

[20:15] <nine> tadzik: around here everyone calls it the Pfizer, but I like to give credit to where credit is due, not just the manufacturer :)

[20:15] <tadzik> fair :)

[20:15] <gfldex> It isn't just the capability to learn but also the emotional level when it comes to accept change. Being scared can dumb down any human.

[20:16] <tadzik> I was caught off guard getting a paper that says "comirnaty"

[20:16] <raydiak_> all I'm trying to say is where you're at after a week is only the very shallow end of the "knowing" pool

[20:16] <codesections> Actually, Bruce Gray had a talk where he argued that Raku has too many "super experts", who not only know Raku but know it so well (and have known it for so long) that they can't remember the challenges of the beginner 

[20:17] <codesections> yeah, 100% agreed that it'd put you on the shallow end

[20:18] <MasterDuke34> and you can see that there are cases where Rat/FatRat/float are created based on whether e.g., the denominator is less than 2**64 or not and/or some of the participating object are already FatRats

[20:18] <gfldex> That's something I can agree on. Pretty much with every blog post I spend at least 15 minutes thinking about what a beginner might need to know to understand what I write about.

[20:18] <gfldex> And then I publish the post anyway. :)

[20:19] <codesections> But I guess where I was coming from is that it doesn't seem (to me) that people should think of themselves as "Perl developers" who need to "retrain" to get a job as a "Javascript developer"; they should think of themselves as software developers applying for a job.

[20:20] <codesections> but maybe that's naive 

[20:20] *** daxim joined
[20:21] <nine> In company history we've only ever hired a single developer who actually knew the languages we use

[20:21] <gfldex> It's not from the standpoint of a developer. Sadly those seldomly decide who gets hired. And that is where the fear is comming from.

[20:21] <stoned75_> MasterDuke34: yeah the XXX is still there, UInt64 was replaced by uint and Rat is still Rational[Int, Int]

[20:21] <stoned75_> or did I missed something ?

[20:22] *** raydiak_ is now known as raydiak

[20:22] <MasterDuke34> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Rat.pm6#L75-L113 for example

[20:23] <stoned75_> MasterDuke34: ooh OK I think  I get it

[20:25] <MasterDuke34> my understanding is that yes, Rat uses the same types for implementation as FatRat, but deliberately changes the result of operations if that result would end up with values in the implementation that exceed a threshold

[20:25] <raydiak> codesections: I would definitely agree that someone with an adequately broad background can step into a job using a language they aren't very experienced with, and very quickly come up to speed with that company's preferred patterns and tools. within certain limits, of course. perl -> js would be a lot easier than, say, perl -> haskell

[20:26] <nine> Come to think of it. My very first job out of school was as a PHP developer. I started looking into PHP 2 hours before the interview :D

[20:26] <codesections> yeah, fully agree.  Stepping outside of the Algol family of languages would make it a lot harder

[20:27] <tadzik> nine: sounds very university :P

[20:27] <stoned75_> MasterDuke34: thanks for your insight

[20:28] <MasterDuke34> welcome. and i also welcome any corrections/expansions from the rest of the channel

[20:34] <raydiak> as for your brain not being anything special...never underestimate yourself. we pretty much all have certain cognitive abilities that we take for granted, which are more challenging for others. some people memorize things easier. some people see and mentally manipulate complicated strucutres more naturally. for others, it's the ability to adapt quickly and operate effectively in less-familiar environments,

[20:34] <raydiak> extrapolating likely truths from a smaller set of known points. some people go through life very successfully on social and linguistic skills more than anything else. whether an ability is "special" or not is pretty subjective

[20:34] <nine> tadzik: Yeah, I'm kinda surprised that this article doesn't contain my picture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome

[20:34] <tadzik> :D

[20:36] <moritz> it's a wiki, we could change that :D

[20:37] <gfldex> And adding a face can't possibly count as defacement.

[20:37] <nine> But they have weird rules :D

[20:37] <nine> gfldex: so it's a.... facement instead?

[20:37] <gfldex> I guess so. But then, I learned English on the interwebs.

[20:38] <stoned75_> the more I dive in the numeric types' doc the more my backlog is growing... I must be missing something :-}

[20:50] <pmurias> codesections: re retrain there is still a gap between learning enough of a language & ecosystem to be productive in it and having a ton of experience and being an expert in it
