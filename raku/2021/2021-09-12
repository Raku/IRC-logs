[07:32] <Summer> is there any way currently to bundle a bunch of raku, an interpreter la rakudo, etc, into a single executable file?

[07:33] <moon-child> rakudo is a compiler, not an interpreter

[07:34] <moon-child> and, not as far as I know.  You can easily make an archive that extracts itself somewhere and runs

[22:29] <sjn> so, should \u[INVISIBLE PLUS] count as an infix + operator in raku? :-)

[22:35] <sjn> not sure I understand how ligatures come into play here..

[22:36] <Xliff> It's not recognizing "¼" as a term.
