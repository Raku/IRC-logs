[00:04] <Petr> thanks

[00:04] <tbrowder> but Raku‚Äôs Inline::Perl5 module is very usable for interface with many Perl modules. and its author is very helpful if you run into problems

[00:04] <perryprog> is the author you

[00:13] <berber44> what is "test-t benchmark"? Is this the same as roast test suit?

[00:15] *** ggoebel left
[00:15] <Petr> what you think about Gumbo? seems to be outdated

[00:16] <berber44> I've read in Rakudo Weekly that new dispatch mechanism made test-t benchmark 20% faster. Does it mean that roast test suit runs 20% faster?

[00:31] <tbrowder> he helped and updated the module when i was trying to interface with a Perl XLS module: John McNamara‚Äôs excellent xls writer modules

[00:31] <tbrowder> which i have used for over 20 yrs

[00:32] <Tirifto> Hello again! Raku is throwing me this error: ‚ÄòCannot look up attributes in a Door type object‚Äô. Door is a class I made, but I can‚Äôt think of anything that would prevent attribute lookup. Are there any well-known gotchas I may have missed?

[00:33] <tbrowder> how are attrs defined? code example?

[00:35] <tbrowder> can we see Door class decl?

[00:36] <tbrowder> and its use? a gist?

[00:40] *** Petr joined
[00:40] <Petr> Can Raku run on android devices&

[00:40] <Petr> ?

[00:42] *** bdju joined
[00:48] <Tirifto> tbrowder: I‚Äôm working on a small (text-based) game for a jam; Door is an Entity (basic game object) supposed to link Rooms together. For design reasons, I don‚Äôt actually put Door objects into Rooms, but I make Doorside objects, each of which is supposed to refer to a Door and delegate its messages to it. But the ‚Äòname‚Äô method didn‚Äôt work as intended when called on Doorside. I thought maybe I misunderstood how d

[00:48] <Tirifto> elegation worked, so I tried to override it with a custom method that just called ‚Äòname‚Äô on the Door object explicitly. That‚Äôs when I got the error.

[00:48] <Tirifto> Here‚Äôs a link to the relevant pieces of code; I can send more if that helps, I just wanted to avoid all the side clutter. https://zerobin.net/?e1a93ba281fc2ef0#WxeVaHSbV8EGj1y+nmxIuyXxvoGJwHZmBrbMyDCjzDk=

[00:52] *** Petr left
[00:52] <Tirifto> Oh wait.

[00:54] <Tirifto> Ohh, when Raku says ‚ÄòDoor type object‚Äô it literally means the object representing the Door type. I wrongly thought it meant any object whose type was Door. That gives me a clue as to what might be wrong. Sorry for the confusion. >_<

[00:54] <Tirifto> (The gist I printed actually tipped me off; thanks!)

[00:56] <Juerd> Tirifto: It may help to know that a typed variable starts out containing the type object

[00:57] <Juerd> Tirifto: So simply having "class Door { has $.foo }; my Door $d; $d.foo;" will get you that error

[00:57] <Juerd> That's because $d is not defined, and thus contains the type object

[00:59] <Tirifto> Juerd: I sort of knew about it but hadn‚Äôt realised the implication in this situation. Thank you for pointing that out. >_<

[00:59] <Juerd> The error message may be slightly LTA because it could mention that the value is not defined to help out people unfamiliar with this pattern.

[01:05] <Tirifto> Hmm‚Ä¶ that sounds nice to have!

[01:07] *** eseyman left
[01:09] <berber44> Hello! Could someone give any hint please what is "test-t benchmark" in the Raku ecosystem?

[01:09] *** eseyman joined
[01:17] <Tirifto> berber44, this is just a wild guess, but perhaps it refers to Rakudo‚Äôs internal performance tests? Raku programs often have tests in the ‚Äòt‚Äô directory, and the only mention of ‚Äòtest-t benchmark‚Äô I found was in an article discussing performance improvements in Rakudo.

[01:21] <Tirifto> Yet another question: When method calls are delegated to another object, they work with the delegatee‚Äôs attributes and not with the original object‚Äôs attributes, right?

[01:24] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: doomvox++ created pull request #3971: order-of-declaration and multi-dispatch

[01:24] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3971

[01:28] <tbrowder> Tirifto: so do you need any help now?

[01:30] <Tirifto> tbrowder: Not badly. ^¬†^ The original problem was resolved, but now I have a new one with delegation. I can likely just read through the documentation and work around it, though.

[01:32] <berber44> Tirifito, I was asking regarding this line in the recent Rakudo weekly: "The really good news is that the well-known test-t benchmark..." And it seems that no one knows anything about this "well-known" benchmark. :-((((("

[01:32] <tbrowder> if you have any probs, a complete example in a gist helps very much those who are helping you

[01:35] <Tirifto> berber44, there seems to be a comment form on the article; perhaps you could submit a question there?

[01:36] <berber44> Good idea.

[01:36] <tbrowder> ‚Äúwell-known‚Äù probably means to core devs

[01:36] <berber44> Ahh, thanks.

[01:37] <Tirifto> tbrowder, thanks for the hint!

[01:39] <tbrowder> the Raku ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù is large and not always easily described to newcomers. please feel free to file an issue in the appropriate place (ask for advice for what ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù is here)

[19:36] <guifa> so random question: if I switch to the RakuAST branch, will that also have the new-disp stuff in it?  I know they were being worked on in parallel for a while.  I imagine much of the work was orthogonal  so the answer is probably yes, but wanted to check

[19:42] <lizmat> I think RakuAST has been rebased on new-disp, yes

[19:42] <MasterDuke> i believe rakuast was just rebased after new-disp was merged, so yeah

[19:42] <lizmat> so you'd be getting all of the new-disp goodies

[20:02] <raydiak> I mean which file

[20:03] <moon-child> S32-list/rduce.t

[20:10] <raydiak> not sure why you'd define something as an operator if it only works for reduction. interesting though, I guess

[20:14] <raydiak> git blame points to TimToady

[20:17] <tonyo_> why would that be an infix anyway?

[20:21] <raydiak> that's why it's confusing, you can never directly use it as an infix operator

[20:31] <[Coke]> all blame points to TimToady!

[20:31] <tonyo_> if the signature was different i'd be one thing

[20:31] <[Coke]> (in a good way. :)

[20:32] <tonyo_> m: sub infix:<op>($x, *@a) is assoc<right> { $x + [*] @a }; say 1 op (2,3,4);

[21:24] <guifa> So there's two routes I'd look at initially: you can build Rakudo on the JVM, although I'm not sure if it runs okay with ART (I suppose it should though), or you can also use the JS build of Rakudo inside of a WebView and communicate that way, but that's definitely a crazy round about way to do it
