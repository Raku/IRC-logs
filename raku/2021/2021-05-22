[01:01] <DarthGandalf> well, that spammer reminded me that I forgot to join #raku there when copying the channels over. So, success, I guess?
[01:02] *** oneeggeach left
[01:03] <AlexDaniel> DarthGandalf: are the channels already registered there?
[01:03] <AlexDaniel> DarthGandalf: I haven't moved myself yet, how does it work?
[01:03] <DarthGandalf> some of them are. #raku isn't registered yet
[01:04] <AlexDaniel> how many users on #raku?
[01:05] <DarthGandalf> 47 so far
[01:05] <AlexDaniel> :O
[01:05] <AlexDaniel> that's actually a lot
[01:05] <DarthGandalf> you should be able to send an email to libera staff to register the project
[01:06] <DarthGandalf> to reserve #raku, cloaks, etc
[01:06] <AlexDaniel> I don't think I can do that‚Ä¶
[01:07] <DarthGandalf> I don't know who in raku is who :) maybe not you then
[01:08] <DarthGandalf> It needs to be someone related to the project, who can confirm that
[01:09] <DarthGandalf> https://libera.chat/chanreg
[01:09] <AlexDaniel> I do have a founder flag on #raku channels but I don't think that really helps in this case
[01:09] <AlexDaniel> it's more of an accident because I registered the channels during the perl6‚Üíraku transition
[01:09] <AlexDaniel> but maybe I can be of service in this particular transition too‚Ä¶

[10:46] <canbenshanlo> another noob question, hoping that the spammers have calmed down: what's the rational behind supporting .map (and the like) as both subs and methods, but .head, for example, can only be used as a method? I know that there's the option to turn any sub into a method via $foo.&sub, but what about the other way around? is there a way to make this work? say head @foo.first(...)?

[10:49] <MasterDuke> canbenshanlo: i'm far less than 100% certain here, but i suspect some of those choices (when made a while ago) were based on what Perl 5 did
[10:51] <lizmat> canbenshanlo: well, in your example, it wouldn't make much sense, as first only returns one thing anyway
[10:52] <lizmat> and as the original author of .head / .tail  I just really think it would make sense to have them as subs as well

[10:56] <canbenshanlo> interesting, so it's at least possible to go with an alias. thanks for that, liz!
[10:57] <lizmat> it would probably be implemented in core like that anyway

[11:01] <canbenshanlo> Good to know, thanks!
[11:01] <El_Che> is there a reason to not offer all the methods as subs and vice versa?
[11:02] <canbenshanlo> Both nim and d are interesting in this regard. stdlib funcs are mostly free-standing and can be called just like methods via UFCS. Shame that this approach isn't all that popular in other langs

[18:55] <dcx> Is there a document that describes how rakudo/nqp/moarvm fit together? I can't quote wrap my hear around how it works 
[18:55] *** sourceable6 joined
[18:56] <dcx> s/quote/quite/  s/hear/head/
[18:56] <moritz> moarvm is a virtual machine designed for dynamic languages
[18:57] *** linkable6 joined
[18:57] <moritz> NQP stands for "Not Quite Perl", which is a simplified version of raku. It serves as a bootstrapping stage, implemented the grammar engine etc.
[18:58] <moritz> rakudo is the main raku compiler, some of it is written in NQP, some in raku itself (bootstrapping is fun!)
[18:58] <dcx> Does nqp sit between rakudo and moarvm translating or does it stop being useful once the VM is running?
[18:59] <dcx> Whats nqp written in then üòµ

[19:00] <moritz> nqp is written in nqp :D
[19:00] *** Juerd joined
[19:01] <moritz> there's a compiled copy of nqp compiled to bytecode committed to the repo
[19:01] *** notable6 joined
[19:02] <moritz> re sitting between, there are some NQP libraries involved while rakudo is compiling raku
[19:03] <dcx> Oh wild
[19:03] *** a3r0_ joined
[19:04] *** Some-body_ joined
[19:04] <dcx> So why do you use a byte-compiled nqp instead of byte-compiled raku? Size?
[19:04] <dcx> A cleaner starting point?
[19:04] *** ecocode__ joined
[19:05] *** nativecallable6 joined
[19:06] <dcx> Easier to port?
[19:06] *** kybr_ joined
[19:06] <dcx> Oh I'd imagine then you'd only need to write an nqp interpreter in order to bootstrap bytecode onto a new VM?

[19:10] *** camelia joined
[19:12] <moritz> size and performance, mostly. And yes, easier to port
[19:12] <moritz> if you have a new backend for NQP, you can cross-compile from an existing backend
[19:12] *** quotable6 joined
[19:13] *** moritz left
[19:13] <moritz> in fact, even the "main" moarvm backend was cross-compiled from the then-prevalent parrot backend :D
[19:15] *** gordonfish joined
[19:17] *** DarthGandalf is now known as Some-body
[19:17] <dcx> Awesome :D
[19:17] *** Some-body is now known as DarthGandalf
[19:17] <moritz> (dead parrot joke intentionally skipped here :D)
[19:18] <dcx> Haha
[19:19] <dcx> So if I understand correctly... Moarvm loads the pre-byte-compiled nqp, which then loads rakudo which is mostly written in nqp, which then directly compiles raku to moarvm bytecode?
[19:21] <moritz> "directly" in that there is no NQP step in between
[19:22] <moritz> but it's source code -> parse tree -> QAST -> MAST (backend specific low-level tree format) -> byte code
[19:22] <moritz> and the QAST -> MAST and MAST -> byte code steps are written in NQP
[19:24] <dcx> The code that outputs byte code in contained in the rakudo repo right?
[19:24] <dcx> Not the nqp repo?
[19:25] <dcx> I'd love to see someone write a blog post on how this works, it's so fascinating :D

[20:15] <raydiak> have we considered a bot which bridges freenode and libera raku channels, just as a stop-gap until the libera matrix bridge and whatever else we've been waiting on is available?
[20:16] *** tgamblin18 left
[20:16] <corwin> we have a similar setup for Fosshost; discord goes to both IRC nets but we don't bridge IRC to IRC
[20:16] <dcx> I suspect a changing the topic to something telling people you've moved to libera is enough, no?
[20:17] *** aluaces left
[20:17] <raydiak> I know a bridge to a bridge is kinda rickety and laggy, but it lets everyone move here now and still chat w/matrix users and whatever else we've bridged to
[20:18] *** aluaces joined
[20:18] <raydiak> afaik the main hold-up has been that there is no matrix bridge for libera yet, and we do have active matrix participants
