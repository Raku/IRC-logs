[01:01] <DarthGandalf> well, that spammer reminded me that I forgot to join #raku there when copying the channels over. So, success, I guess?

[01:02] *** oneeggeach left
[01:03] <AlexDaniel> DarthGandalf: are the channels already registered there?

[01:03] <AlexDaniel> DarthGandalf: I haven't moved myself yet, how does it work?

[01:03] <DarthGandalf> some of them are. #raku isn't registered yet

[01:04] <AlexDaniel> how many users on #raku?

[01:05] <DarthGandalf> 47 so far

[01:05] <AlexDaniel> :O

[01:05] <AlexDaniel> that's actually a lot

[01:05] <DarthGandalf> you should be able to send an email to libera staff to register the project

[01:06] <DarthGandalf> to reserve #raku, cloaks, etc

[01:06] <AlexDaniel> I don't think I can do that‚Ä¶

[01:07] <DarthGandalf> I don't know who in raku is who :) maybe not you then

[01:08] <DarthGandalf> It needs to be someone related to the project, who can confirm that

[01:09] <DarthGandalf> https://libera.chat/chanreg

[01:09] <AlexDaniel> I do have a founder flag on #raku channels but I don't think that really helps in this case

[01:09] <AlexDaniel> it's more of an accident because I registered the channels during the perl6‚Üíraku transition

[01:09] <AlexDaniel> but maybe I can be of service in this particular transition too‚Ä¶

[10:46] <canbenshanlo> another noob question, hoping that the spammers have calmed down: what's the rational behind supporting .map (and the like) as both subs and methods, but .head, for example, can only be used as a method? I know that there's the option to turn any sub into a method via $foo.&sub, but what about the other way around? is there a way to make this work? say head @foo.first(...)?

[10:49] <MasterDuke> canbenshanlo: i'm far less than 100% certain here, but i suspect some of those choices (when made a while ago) were based on what Perl 5 did

[10:51] <lizmat> canbenshanlo: well, in your example, it wouldn't make much sense, as first only returns one thing anyway

[10:52] <lizmat> and as the original author of .head / .tail  I just really think it would make sense to have them as subs as well

[10:53] *** Kaeipi left
[10:53] *** Merfont joined
[10:54] <lizmat> to answer your question, you can turn a method into a sub:

[10:54] <lizmat> m: my constant &tail = Any.^find_method("tail"); say tail <a b c>

[10:54] <canbenshanlo> doesn't make sense? well, .first could return a list, and i only care about the first element within it, for example.

[10:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar face292a0: OUTPUT: ¬´c‚ê§¬ª

[10:55] <lizmat> canbenshanlo: point taken :-)

[10:56] <canbenshanlo> interesting, so it's at least possible to go with an alias. thanks for that, liz!

[10:57] <lizmat> it would probably be implemented in core like that anyway

[10:57] <lizmat> alternately:

[10:57] <lizmat> m: sub head(\a) { a.head }; head <a b c>

[10:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar face292a0: ( no output )

[10:58] <lizmat> m: sub head(\a) { a.head }; say head <a b c>

[10:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar face292a0: OUTPUT: ¬´a‚ê§¬ª

[10:58] <lizmat> that would make it a runtime lookup

[11:01] <El_Che> is there a reason to not offer all the methods as subs and vice versa?

[11:02] <canbenshanlo> Both nim and d are interesting in this regard. stdlib funcs are mostly free-standing and can be called just like methods via UFCS. Shame that this approach isn't all that popular in other langs

[13:37] <AlexDaniel`> canbenshanlo: the spammers have not calmed down, it's just that they're not able to say anything because of the bot

[13:37] <AlexDaniel`> those who miss the spam can get +o :) then you'll see all of it

[14:29] <whatnext> hello all:) ¬†is anyone familiar with this error when using Red: `Type check failed in assignment to $!right; expected Red::AST but got Slip (Empty)

[14:29] <whatnext> ¬† in method new at /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/sources/E32D428566231F82FC5B1EAF0FDBB830F45FB159 (Red::AST::Infix) line 25` ? I found this: `https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/449` - but in my case I am trying to select from a table where pk is not an fk. Anyone have any idea any other ways it can happen? I am doing a simple `^all` lookup

[14:36] <OrngeRain> Ip4 is superior.
