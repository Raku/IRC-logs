[15:05] <patrickb> ugexe: Thanks for the quick pointer
[15:06] *** reportable6 joined
[15:08] <patrickb> I had pretty much the same problem. A firewall that blocks all binary downloads, but doesn't break into HTTPS, so usually no one cares.
[15:08] *** daxim joined
[15:11] <Altreus> all https is binary downloads :D
[15:13] <xinming> Is there a way to modify adverb for small block of regex? For example, disable :sigspace inline
[15:14] <ugexe> does something like [:sigspace ...] work?
[15:15] <ugexe> (i cant actually check atm)

[19:53] <tinita> hello. I'm getting this error when trying to install YAMLish 0.0.5: https://gist.github.com/perlpunk/6212d48626ac08635e74e2398001725d
[19:53] <tinita> background: I'm installing different yaml libraries in alpine docker images
[19:54] <lizmat> it looks like 0.0.5 is no longer on CPAN?
[19:54] <tinita> what am I doing wrong? it has been working a while ago
[19:54] <lizmat> on CPAN there's only 0.0.6 apparent;y
[19:55] <tinita> oh great. that sounds like an easy fix. trying =)
[19:55] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm currently working on being able to download the 0.0.5 version from a Raku "BackPan"
[19:55] <lizmat> well, in the future... as the 0.0.5 version cannot be salvaged atm
[20:00] <tinita> for now it unblocked me, it working. thanks =)
[20:00] <lizmat> you're welcome
[20:00] <lizmat> fwiw, you're doing the right thing in requiring a specific version in your code
[20:01] <lizmat> and in the future, zef will also check for BackPan pretty sure  :-)
[20:02] <El_Che> lizmat: have you looked at golang's solution?
[20:03] <lizmat> no, what is golang's solution?
[20:03] *** reportable6 joined
[20:03] <El_Che> semver + a proxy
[20:04] <El_Che> the main is googles, but you're free to setup your own
[20:06] <lizmat> ah, that: yes, we're doing something similar, I think :-)
[20:07] <El_Che> hey don't warranty to keep everything, but they do
[20:07] <El_Che> moving a git tag around is a big no-no there
