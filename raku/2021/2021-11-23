[01:06] <Guest495> Hi all!

[01:06] <Guest495> Is it possible to put the sort in front of things:

[01:06] <Guest495> m: say ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'].sort: *.chars;

[01:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: OUTPUT: «(an test length amazing)␤»

[01:06] <Guest495> Something like:

[01:07] <Guest495> m: say sort(*.chars): ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'];

[01:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: OUTPUT: «Ambiguous call to 'sort(WhateverCode)'; these signatures all match:␤  (&by, +values)␤  (+values)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:08] <Juerd> Guest495: sort(*.chars, [...]);

[01:09] <Juerd> With ":", the it's always "topic.method:" or "method topic:", so the sort function still comes last.

[01:10] <Guest495> Thank you!

[01:11] <Juerd> Guest495: By the way, you can use <an amazing length test> instead of quoting each word and using commas, to save some typing.

[01:12] <Guest495> Merci Juerd!

[01:12] <Guest495> m: say sort *.chars, <an amazing length test>

[01:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: OUTPUT: «(an test length amazing)␤»
