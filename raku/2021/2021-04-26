[12:27] <xinming_> How is %?RESOURCES hash handled? When I in cro, %?RESOURCES<path/to-resource> returns file, while I use  `raku -e '%?RESOURCES<path/to-resource>'` returns nothing

[12:32] <xinming_> anyone knows? :-)

[12:34] * lizmat doesn't know off-hand

[13:12] <ugexe> Resources is for distributions / modules. -e is neither of those things 

[13:15] <xinming_> ugexe: So, can we make raku to load resources even in oneliners?

[13:16] <ugexe> No

[13:17] *** sena_kun left
[13:20] <ugexe> Resources is specifically tied to a distribution. And raku certainly doesn’t try to guess what local non default libs to use for one liners even if you are coincidently inside of a distributions local git repo

[13:21] <ugexe> Like what if there are multiple distributions using resources? Should it just pick one at random?

[13:21] <ugexe> these questions are rhetorical of course 

[13:22] <ugexe> You are welcome to expose your own api to resources e.g. create a sub that returns resources and cal that from your one liner

[15:24] <uzl[m]> Is blogs.perl.org done for? All Damian's Raku blogs are an excellent case study of raku's flexibility, and it'd be sad to lose them. I figured they might be archived in one of those archiving systems, but it'd better to have them in a single place (or multiple ones for redundancy:-)).

[17:01] <[Coke]> why do we think BPO is going away?

[17:02] <lizmat> because several maintainers / moderators have at least mentioned it making read-only ?

[17:04] <[Coke]> is there a BPO or news.perlfoundation post or a slack discussiona about it?

[17:04] <[Coke]> Just haven't seen the discussion myself, is all

[17:04] <lizmat> I seem to recall it having been posted on BPO itself in the past year ?

[17:06] <El_Che> is blogs.perl.org used by the raku community

[17:07] <El_Che> ok

[17:07] <lizmat> I don't think there is any *Raku* content there

[17:08] <El_Che> I had a quick look and there is more perl context there than there used to

[17:08] <lizmat> *content ?

[17:08] <El_Che> yes :)

[17:08] <lizmat> ok, gotcha, just checking :-)

[23:58] <japhb> I just created the TinyFloats module, collecting conversion routines for tiny floating point formats.  The very first version supports conversion to/from IEEE 754 "binary16" format.  More formats to be added later as needed.

[23:59] <japhb> I also used this to support decoding of float16 in CBOR::Simple, which I've just bumped to 0.0.5 and uploaded.
