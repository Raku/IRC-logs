[13:09] <pilne> so, since i lurb prolog so much, but prefer to do non-prolog stuff, not in prolog :D i can... (ab?)use inline::perl5 to use the perl5 module "AI::Prolog"???? (and work towards a possible 100% raku implimentation if i feel froggy?)

[13:10] <pilne> or avoid the GIL-concurrency woes of.... other languages by using inline::otherlang?

[13:12] <tbrowder> some advice, please: eventually i will need some binary java or c or c++ prog installed for a module. the source is in java. to start with, can the Build.raku take care of the work required (extract source from resources, compile, and install on the local host)?

[13:14] <tbrowder> (but i plan to convert java to c++ and use native call)

[13:15] <tbrowder> pilne: i have been using perl modules successfully with raku.

[14:28] <guifa2> tbrowder: it should be able to.  IIRC you just put a Build.pm6 in the root directory of the module, and you can run whatever commands you need to there.  But I haven't done anything with that yet (the only C code I use is a resource in a pre-build process)

[14:28] <tonyo> tbrowder: the `native` flag from the original didn't make it's way into zef's s:q

[14:29] <vrurg> tonyo: fez gives me LTA error 'wget error'. Nothing else besides it. For the same reason, I think, the module is not indexed and I get emailed back with 'panic caught'. Again, no details.

[14:30] <vrurg> tonyo: Unfortunately, I have a meeting right now, won't be able to diagnose it better until later today.

[14:30] <tonyo> vrurg: are you on 15? i pushed a bunch of fixes for some of that yesterday or the day before

[14:30] <tonyo> i'm just starting my day so will be around to chat after your meeting

[14:31] <tbrowder> i have used a Makefile in Build.raku and it seems to work fine. i’ll just get the Makefile working and the see what happens.

[14:31] <vrurg> Ah, updates to 16 now. Will check.

[14:34] <oddp> Wut, since when is this multi-dim slicing/accessing working? @foo[a..b; c..d]

[14:34] <oddp> Sweet!

[14:36] <oddp> #AreWeJuliaYet

[14:38] <guifa2> oddp: that's been around for a while actually, although lizmat made it go lightning fast recently

[14:39] <vrurg> tonyo: fez 16 doesn't result in wget, but I still get 'Meta error: panic caught' from zef on email.

[14:39] <oddp> Thought I tried that half a year ago and it spewed errors.

[14:46] <tbrowder> another question: will any binary found in a module's ./bin dir work when installed by zef? e.g., a compiled java prog?

[14:46] <tbrowder> java cli prog?

[14:47] <tbrowder> probably not...

[14:48] *** |oLa| left
[14:49] *** |oLa| joined
[14:50] <tbrowder> ah, but one in ./resources i think can be called by the installed repo, and its subs and methods, maybe that's the answer!

[14:50] <tbrowder> or not...

[14:50] <guifa2> tbrowder: in a pinch you can always put it in the resources and grab the path to the file 

[14:51] <tbrowder> yes, that's what i'm thinking

[14:52] <tbrowder> and a java cli should work on most hosts, should it not?

[14:53] <guifa2> Actually, java isn't installed by default on Macs.  Not sure on Windows.  

[14:53] <guifa2> But you can make set java as a requirement for install

[14:54] <tbrowder> oh, cool, with Build as tonyo said?

[15:03] <tonyo> vrurg: good news about wget - you mind emailing me your tarball and i'll take a look?  i'll pm my email

[15:05] <vrurg> tonyo: the wget problem is gone with fez 16. It's now the server side which fails.

[15:08] <tonyo> understood.  i'll see if the tar stayed because of the panic but i usually don't have access if an email was sent

[15:10] <tonyo> if you don't mind emailing me whatever is in your `sdist` folder i can take a look and figure out what happened

[15:10] <tonyo> and then fix the issue so it's not a future problem 

[15:13] <guifa2> tbrowder: the java requirement would be in the dependencies part of the meta6

[16:13] <guifa2> It should be actually possible, I think, to create a POD6 declarator for other languages

[16:13] <guifa2> so you could do =begin md

[16:14] <masak> I'm kind of in the camp of "Markdown is the worst format, except for all the other formats"

[16:14] * guifa2 actually likes markdown

[16:14] <masak> well, me too. a lot.

[16:14] <guifa2> I made a dialect of it for my transcriptions

[16:15] <guifa2> If you've ever seen a TEI document, or worse ever had to write one……

[16:15] <masak> I just wish it didn't have to be so complicated.

[16:15] <perry> Personally, I really like org-mode's markdown syntax.

[16:15] <perry> https://orgmode.org/quickstart.html#markup

[16:15] <masak> I think my ideal would be (a) something very much like Markdown, but (b) that I could reconstruct from first principles if needed

[16:16] <masak> perry: I'll check that out -- thank you

[16:17] <El_Che> The thing is that the kids know md and it's good enough

[16:17] <perry> Good luck inserting a link or image without 1) a button that inserts the text 2) looking it up

[16:58] <PimDaniel> Hi \o

[16:59] <PimDaniel> Does anybody know how to make a sub (or method) prototype that receives an associative of associative?

[17:06] <guifa2> proto foo (Associative %foo) { * }

[17:09] <PimDaniel> I do not even know the proto keyword :(

[17:10] <guifa2> but if you were just wanting a model of a sub that does it

[17:10] <guifa2> sub foo (Associative %foo) { … Ç

[17:10] <guifa2> { … }

[17:13] <PimDaniel> Well here's what i need : The caller is : color(foreground => %(red => 33,blue => 22, green => 178, background => % the same); but this is probably not the better way to archieve this.

[17:13] <tonyo> if you're trying to force that structure you can use a `where` in the sub sig

[17:15] <PimDaniel> No i don't need to force anything , just to control eventualy. I made the same in php with a hash of list.

[17:15] <PimDaniel> I'v not been able yet to pass a hash to a sub. :(

[17:16] <tonyo> m: sub x (%x) { %x.raku.say; }; x( {hello => 'world'} );

[17:16] <evalable6> tonyo, rakudo-moar d53d03080: OUTPUT: «{:hello("world")}␤»

[17:17] <PimDaniel> hum this is my  caller that is bad.

[17:19] <tonyo> if you want to pass that foreground as you can do it one of two ways

[17:19] <tonyo> m: sub color(*%x) { %x.say; }; color(foreground => %(red => 33,blue => 22, green => 178, background => 5));

[17:19] <evalable6> tonyo, rakudo-moar d53d03080: OUTPUT: «{foreground => {background => 5, blue => 22, green => 178, red => 33}}␤»

[17:19] <tonyo> m: sub color(:%foreground) { %foreground.say; }; color(foreground => %(red => 33,blue => 22, green => 178, background => 5));

[17:19] <evalable6> tonyo, rakudo-moar d53d03080: OUTPUT: «{background => 5, blue => 22, green => 178, red => 33}␤»

[17:20] <PimDaniel> tonyo; OOOOh  thanks, this is what i'm searching!

[17:21] <PimDaniel> but why that didn't work ! i made exactly that. :(

[17:22] <PimDaniel> Ok thanks tonyo and guifa2 : i must look carrefully and try again i'll watch your informations, searching into the reference...

[17:22] <tonyo> you likely forgot the `:` on the %foreground.  if you're sending `foreground => ...` it doesn't coalesce to { foreground => ...}, it attempts to assign to a named variable `foreground` in the signature

[17:44] <RaycatWhoDat> Silly question but how crazy would calling some sort of Raku AOT artifact through NativeCall be?

[17:44] <RaycatWhoDat> I'm tickled by the notion of using Raku to speed up Raku

[17:45] <RaycatWhoDat> Even if it's a fantasy

[17:46] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat: That's what Raku does out of the box...

[17:46] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat:plus I guess we have to let the optimizer work by using it through high-level functions.

[17:47] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat: maybe the new RakuAST engine will have a bit of more access to internals... but it will be through macros, not through NativeCall. Far as I can tell, at least.

[17:47] <RaycatWhoDat> jmerelo: Really? Could you point me towards more information on that? I didn't know that was happening

[17:48] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/g44xe6/grant_proposal_rakuast_jonathan_worthington/ then you can access the periodical reports at the Perl Foundation site

[17:49] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh, sorry, not the RakuAST stuff

[17:50] <RaycatWhoDat> The reply to "using Raku to speed up Raku"

[17:50] <RaycatWhoDat> Unless I'm just dense?

[17:52] <tadzik> I'm not sure what you mean by "calling some sort of Raku AOT artifact through NativeCall"

[17:52] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat: there's a bit about jitting in Raku here https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kph5n4/how_fast_an_interpreter_language_can_be/gj4lpc4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

[17:53] <jmerelo> RaycatWhoDat: I can't find reference to how the optimizer works. Probably in some jnthn's talk.

[17:53] <RaycatWhoDat> tadzik: I thought it would be interesting if Raku was able to compile a module and call it through NativeCall or something of the sort.

[17:53] <RaycatWhoDat> jmerelo: No worries. Thanks for the links!

[17:54] <tadzik> RaycatWhoDat: so that assumes that you can compile Raku code to native code that will run faster than what's currently ran on MoarVM

[17:54] <tadzik> which is a bold assumption :) There's a reason MoarVM exists rather than Rakudo just targeting LLVM or something

[17:56] <tadzik> and the start of the problem is there is currently nothing that can generate "native" binaries from Raku code

[17:57] <RaycatWhoDat> tadzik: Makes sense.

[17:58] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh well. Fun to think about.

[18:51] <PimDanie1> Why is pack still experimental? Can i use it?

[18:51] *** wamba joined
[18:52] <PimDanie1> I'm afraid it it desapear tomorrow.

[18:52] <jmerelo> PimDanie1: I think that halfway along implementation people realized that maybe that Perl feature wasn't too worth the while to invest time into.

[18:53] <jmerelo> PimDanie1: It's not planned to be obsolete far as I can tell, but it might not be as complete as you'd expect (meaning: not as complete as in Perl)

[18:54] <PimDanie1> Are there workaround?

[18:54] <PimDanie1> What i wanna do is :

[18:54] *** aindilis joined
[18:55] <PimDanie1> i have 3 int8

[18:55] <jmerelo> Give it a try. I think you're good with that.

[18:56] <jmerelo> Also, everyone, Google Summer of Code is about to be announced. We need your projects here https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/gsoc-2021-ideas We're going to apply under the aegis of The Perl Foundation

[18:56] <PimDanie1> and i wanna convert them to one int 24, well let's say 32.

[18:56] <PimDanie1> It is easy to do with C language.

[18:57] <PimDanie1> Another solution should be tu use bits seeking, may be better, no?

[19:00] <PimDanie1> haha i see read-bits method in the reference, may be it's better

[19:04] <PimDanie1> Ok thank's : back tomorrow.

[21:51] <raku-bridge> <ionsolo> what's the intended use of is pure trait?

[21:53] <oddp> https://docs.raku.org/routine/is%20pure

[21:55] <oddp> Man, arr.flat not flattening an array of arrays got me again today. :(

[21:56] <raku-bridge> <ionsolo> but how the compiler know the output it's the same? memoizes the results?

[21:57] <MasterDuke> you tell the compiler by using the trait. it doesn't verify

[21:59] <raku-bridge> <ionsolo> oddp try [;] with a star less or more with more dimensions you have

[21:59] <raku-bridge> <ionsolo> '@a[;]

[22:01] <oddp> >>.List.flat does it, but you always have to remember that when handling arrays.

[22:03] <oddp> Oh, cool, never seen that before, slick.

[23:02] <shan> https://gist.github.com/shantaram3013/39b9d6f31e5f0b7647be52064fc51152 why does this not work

[23:11] <vrurg> shan: usually it is considered a good practice to explain what exactly happens. But my first guess is that I can't load the module because rakudo doesn't search for modules in the current directory.

[23:12] <shan> vrurg: how am i supposed to make it do that? 

[23:14] <vrurg> Oh, it actually should read "it can't load the module".

[23:14] <vrurg> shan: do what exactly?

[23:14] <shan> AYYY it worked

[23:14] <shan> vrurg: look for modules in the current directory

[23:15] <shan> the answer is "use lib 'lib'"

[23:15] <shan> and make a folder called lib
