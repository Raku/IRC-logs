[07:50] <dora> hello. this is totally off-topic but i don't know where to ask. there is a talk on youtube given by Larry Wall.

[07:50] <dora> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpH9BTMZKXc

[07:51] <dora> i see he is using vim to deliver the presentation

[07:51] <dora> i find this very elegant.

[07:52] <dora> can someone please point of if it there is some plugin or script or some feature in vim which allows one to do that

[07:54] <moritz> googling for `vim presentation` finds several options

[07:55] *** epony left
[08:01] <CIAvash> moritz: could you (or someone else) invite me back to the Raku github organization?

[08:02] <CIAvash> I want to bring an improved version of flycheck-raku (syntax checking for emacs) to raku organanization

[08:08] <dora> thanks moritz

[17:22] <codesections> tobs: the first web result I found indicated that "permute" can mean "change the order" (e.g., "I permuted <a b c> into <c a b>") but "permutate" always means "calculate the permutations".  But :shrug:

[17:25] <codesections> I mean, I do to, in that I'm not sure I even knew "permutate" was a word! (Though the meaning is obvious in context)

[17:26] <codesections> But I do have the sense that, at least speaking informally, you can permute something without knowing *all* the permutations 

[17:29] <tobs> and from looking at the examples in the docs, I think combinations is not a substitute for permutations, as combinations do not care about order.

[17:30] *** Tirifto[m] left
[17:30] *** pwr22 left
[17:30] <codesections> right

[17:31] <tobs> the number of combinations doesn't explode as much as that of permutations, but it seems strange that combinations(200_000_000) returns a Seq but permutations(21) throws an error
