[22:26] <tellable6> 2021-01-23T15:21:09Z #raku-dev <Xliff> dwarring Does LibXML expose xmlNsPtr to Raku? If so, what compunit do I need to load to get it? Thanks.

[22:28] <moon-child> dwarring: yeah, there are some weird interactions with native types and the class hierarchy.  Not sure if it's intentional

[22:28] <dwarring> bugworthy?

[22:31] <dwarring> Hadn't noticed that before, I'll put in a ticket

[22:33] <moon-child> wait...what?

[22:34] <moon-child> oh

[22:34] <moon-child> nevermind, I misread the source

[22:34] <dwarring> .tell Xliff 'use LibXML::Raw imports xmlNs as class native xmlNs

[22:34] <tellable6> dwarring, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[22:38] <tellable6> dwarring, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[22:39] <dwarring> ^^ doesn't seem logical

[22:40] <moon-child> bootstrap.c/BOOTSTRAP.nqp:4051 'Roles pretend to be narrower than certain types for the purpose of type checking'

[22:41] <moon-child> following is a hash containing Numeric and Real, but not Cool or Int

[22:42] <moon-child> and, indeed, uint !~~ Real (even thought uint ~~ Int ~~ Real).  So I would guess that's related

[22:44] <dwarring> ahh, so intentional

[22:45] <moon-child> I think it's an unintended consequence of something else

[23:51] <mykhal> maybe because it has ambiguous regex meaning, like e.g. \s, unlike e.g. \t
