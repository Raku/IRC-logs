[07:35] <Guest722> Hello all! I have got one question about callable and DateTime. Do I the right thing here:
[07:35] <Guest722> my &f = sub ($self) { $self.str; };
[07:35] <Guest722> DateTime.now(formatter => &f);
[07:35] <Guest722> DateTime.now then blocks, nothing is returned ever. I have to cancel the program via CTRL + C. or after some time the OS kills the process:
[07:35] <Guest722> > my &f = sub () {}
[07:35] <Guest722> sub { }
[07:35] <Guest722> > say DateTime.now(formatter => &f)
[07:35] <Guest722> Too many positionals passed; expected 0 arguments but got 1

[07:37] <moon-child> Guest722: what do you expect to happen?
[07:38] *** xinming joined
[07:38] <moon-child> when you ask the DateTime to format itself, it calls that subroutine you defined with itself.  That subroutine then asks the DateTime to format itself, so it calls the subroutine you gave it, which asks the DateTime to format itself, in response to which it calls the subroutine you gave it ...

[15:50] <m6locks> hi, how to install raku on bsd
[15:50] <m6locks> Couldn't find a precomp release for OS: "openbsd", architecture: "x86_64"
[15:51] <m6locks> I thought rakubrew compiled from sources
[15:51] <m6locks> (like rvm)
[15:56] <patrickb> We currently don't offer precompiled releases for openbsd, because there are some technical difficulties. 
[15:57] <patrickb> rakubrew can compile from source, but can also download precompiled releases. 
[15:57] <MasterDuke> i would expect compiling with rakubrew to work, but if not couldn't you take the script or whatever from ports and manually use that?
[15:57] <patrickb> Use the `download` and `build` subcommands respectively.
[16:30] <m6locks> ok, will try thx

[19:30] <Kaiepi> SmokeMachine, the &factory block looks gather-ish. do the assignments come with side effects? 
[19:33] <SmokeMachine> Kaiepi: I use the model type to generate factory type for each model used by a factory and each factory is a instance of that class. The assignments applies to that instance
[19:40] <SmokeMachine> Kaiepi: does that make sense?
[19:40] <Kaiepi> replacing the assignments with take (key => value) in combination with something like .bless(|(gather block), |%rest) might allow for bindings to work as well
[19:43] <SmokeMachine> That was my first try, but I wanted that to need the method to existâ€¦ to maybe in a future have that autocompleted by an ideâ€¦
[19:43] <Kaiepi> ah
[19:44] <SmokeMachine> Make sense?
[19:46] <Kaiepi> not really :(. not very familiar with red

[21:05] <algorev> Hello
[21:05] <algorev> I've just got this error on some code I wrote:
[21:05] <algorev> "Autovivifying object closures not yet implemented. Sorry."
[21:05] <algorev> It's a compile-time error
[21:06] <algorev> Does someone know what the heck it could mean?
[21:11] *** seednode left
[21:16] *** seednode joined
[21:18] <lizmat> could you create a gist with the --ll-exception backtrace ?
[21:23] <algorev> https://gist.github.com/algorev/aa28de561b06e4d975b4a7b30e1be1b1
[21:23] <algorev> I added the affected code too
[21:26] <MasterDuke> i suspect you need a space after your role/class names, before the '{'
[21:27] <algorev> Oh
[21:27] <algorev> It worked!
[21:27] <algorev> Thanks a lot!
[21:27] <algorev> I do have a last question though
[21:27] <lizmat> yeah, also for the methods for consistency  :-)
[21:28] <algorev> How do you `require` code from a file that's in the same directory
[21:28] <algorev> Raku's module system confuses me
[21:28] <algorev> lizmat very good point ahah
[21:30] <lizmat> algorev: I guess the question should first be: why do you need 'require' ?
[21:31] <algorev> The file i sent in the gist contains a few class and role definitions and i'd like to use the from another file
[21:31] <algorev> *them
[21:32] <lizmat> perhaps https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Exporting_and_selective_importing could be of help ?
[21:33] <algorev> Sounds like it
[21:33] <algorev> Though in my case raku seems to think that the current directory is not part of the module search path
[21:33] <algorev> Is there an option to tell it where to look?
[21:33] <algorev> I'm making a gist showing what it tells me
[21:33] <lizmat> -I
[21:33] <lizmat> if you must
[21:34] <lizmat> aka, -I.
[21:34] <lizmat> there are a bunch of reasons for not wanting to use that in production, but for prototyping it's ok
[21:37] <algorev> https://gist.github.com/algorev/be7728c27d822ec45f631c42fa7d11dc
[21:38] <algorev> I'd prefer knowing the correct way if i can make it work
[21:38] <algorev> Less hassle for everyone down the road
[21:44] <lizmat> I would use "use ActivationFunction" and call the script with -I.
[21:45] <lizmat> and probably drop the "use v6"  , that's really redundant in a script with a .raku extension
[21:48] <algorev> It worked! Thanks a lot. Also, noted for the v6 ;)
