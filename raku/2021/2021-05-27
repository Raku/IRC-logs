[10:22] <Xliff> \o
[10:22] <Xliff> Good morning. 
[10:22] <Altreus> o/
[10:22] <Xliff> I would like to change the precidence rules for infix:<+>. What would be the best way to accomplish this?
[10:23] <Altreus>  /o\
[10:23] <Xliff> Please note. Creating a new operator is not in scope.
[10:23] <Xliff> It MUST be infix:<+>
[10:23] <lizmat> should it be active in a lexical scope ?
[10:23] <Xliff> lizmat: Whichever way is easiest.
[10:24] <Xliff> infix:<+> should be tighter than infix:<*>
[10:25] <moritz> I don't think you can do that in raku
[10:26] <Xliff> moritz: Why not? All of the tools are there.
[10:26] <Xliff> Is it because of the way CORE defines these ops?
[10:26] <lizmat> you could try it by replacing the infix:<+> candidates with your own, starting with:
[10:26] <lizmat> proto sub infix:<+>(\a,\b) is tighter(&infix:<*>) {*}
[10:27] <Xliff> lizmat: OK, will do.
[10:27] <Altreus> I feel like tighter could easily have been called tigher-than and with profound effect
[10:28] <moritz> Xliff: I might be wrong, but my understanding is that defining a new operator implies deriving a new grammar from an existing one, and deriving a grammar always means *adding* something
[10:28] *** colomon joined
[10:29] <Xliff> moritz: OK. I am approaching this from the docs: First https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Loose_AND_precedence
[10:29] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[10:29] <Xliff> And then https://docs.raku.org/language/optut
[10:29] <Xliff> Nothing here mentions grammars.
[10:30] <Xliff> Just an FYI
[10:37] <Xliff> OK. Still returns result indicating no chaneg.
[10:37] <Xliff> https://glot.io/snippets/fyznw9646b
[10:42] *** stoned75 left
[10:43] <lizmat> Xliff: can you verify that it calls *your* infix:<+> ?
[10:44] <Xliff> Sure thing.
[10:44] <Xliff> It does. 
[10:44] <Xliff> https://glot.io/snippets/fyznw9646b
[10:45] <Xliff> B should be 2, not 8
[10:46] <lizmat> agree... so the codegen is not looking at the precedence of the actual infix:<+> in scope :-(
[10:46] <Xliff> Looks like it.
[10:46] *** stoned75 joined
[10:47] <lizmat> probably worth an issue, so we can make sure it will work when the RakuAST branch lands
[10:47] <Xliff> OK. Will submit.
[10:47] <lizmat> I don't see a shorter-term solution
[10:48] <Xliff> I'll take what I can get. Thank you, lizmat++
[10:48] <lizmat> of course, if you could do a PR that would fix that  :-)  
[10:53] <dakkar> I'm pretty sure this problem is related to the other one we noticed a few days ago on the same topic‚Ä¶
[10:53] <dakkar> that precedence/associativity of an operator is picked from the first proto or candidate compiled
[10:54] <dakkar> (and then the compiler doesn't complain when you provide mis-matched candidates)
[10:54] <dakkar> so rakudo compiles the setting, sets prec/assoc of infix:<+>, then ignores every other prec/assoc for it, even for a "new" `proto`
[10:55] <Xliff> dakkar: Was an issue raised for that?
[10:56] <dakkar> there's already one
[10:56] * dakkar greps his logs
[10:56] <Xliff> 1237?
[10:56] <Xliff> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1237
[10:57] <Xliff> Wow. Almost 4 years old.
[10:57] <dakkar> yes, that one

[18:01] <lucs> It appears that bots don't respond to /msg.
[18:01] <lucs> Is this a known problem?
[18:02] <tadzik> someone's just pointed it out
[18:02] <lucs> Aha. I'll go ask in #libera
[18:02] *** reportable6 left
[18:02] <jast> it's probably an implementation issue
[18:03] <jast> I've got a bot running that works fine, but I needed to make adjustments because a feature they relied on didn't exist on libera (libera has the "next generation" version of that feature)

[18:18] <lucs> jast: So it replies to your /msg ?
[18:19] <jast> my bot? yes.
[18:19] <lucs> Hmm...
[18:19] <tonyo> what bot are you trying to msg lucs 
[18:19] <lucs> tonyo: camelia
[18:20] <lucs>  /msg camelia m: say 2 + 2       No reply
[18:24] <jast> looking at the bot's source I'm not seeing anything suspicious
[18:24] *** juanfra left

[18:29] <lucs> jast: What's that feature you needed to adjust for?
[18:29] <jast> my bot was depending on the "identify-msg" client capability, which has been supersded by "account-tag"
[18:29] <jast> but I don't see camelia using that

[18:46] <juanfra> "NickServ (NickServ@services.libera.chat): camelia is not registered."
[18:46] <juanfra> maybe the problem is that camelia is not a registered user
[18:47] <jast> shouldn't really matter
[18:48] <juanfra> or maybe camelia is registered but the bot is not login with a password
[18:48] <lucs> I'm getting help from someone in #libera and here's what I understand so far:
[18:48] <lucs> Yes, the bot better be registered, else it won't be allowed to talk to users who have +R set.
[18:49] <jast> ooh, nasty
[18:49] <juanfra> my user has +R, so that's the problem
[18:49] <jast> but also not too hard to fix I guess
[18:50] <lucs> And more than registered, it also has to be identified, something like  /msg nickserv identify pAsSwOrD  or using SASL (see libera.chat site).
[18:51] <jast> the bot already supports identifying with nickserv, someone just needs to make it happen on libera
[18:52] <juanfra> you need to be logged and you user can't have +R
[18:52] <juanfra> with -R camelia works
[18:54] <lucs> juanfra: Welp, I'd rather keep my +R, just saying :)
[18:55] <juanfra> yes, i know. i was just trying to find where was the problem.
[18:56] <lucs> juanfra: Ah, okay, thanks.
[18:58] <lucs> Who handles the bots around here?
[18:59] <moritz> depepnds on the bot, I thinks
[19:01] <lucs> Yeah, makes sense.
[19:02] <lucs> I'm also told: "if possible sasl external and cert auth is more secure way than plain password"
[19:02] <lucs> So the bot owners may have to tweak things a bit for the bots to work seamlessly.
