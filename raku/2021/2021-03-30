[10:48] <tadzik> ah, sorry :( 

[10:50] * PimDaniel tadzik : i should have probably use $!bar is built like proposed me lizmat.

[10:51] <tadzik> sounds like a good idea

[10:55] * PimDaniel tadzik What i was just trying to say and sorry that i was not clear, is that you can't access any class attribute before it is blessed. Well you can pass it to bless but nothing more; Do you agree? Or there is something that i mess?

[10:55] <PimDaniel> *or messed may be.

[11:13] *** natrys joined
[11:13] <PimDaniel> hum well i must be more precise : you can attrib on the default new constructor but only with given posisionnal parameters not with overloaded constructors and even with is built.

[11:23] <lizmat> PimDaniel: inside the .new method, there is no object yet, just a type

[11:24] <lizmat> so you cannot access any attributes yet, as there aren't any yet

[11:25] *** dustinm` joined
[11:25] <tadzik> yeah. You can transform it to your heart's desire *before* you pass it to bless though, and after the bless you can still do whatever you want on the object

[11:25] <tadzik> after the bless, but before the new() ends

[11:26] <lizmat> yeah, but *not* inside of the "new" method itself

[11:26] <lizmat> because there "self" is still the type object, so $!foo won't work

[11:26] <tadzik> oh, right. You can call methods on the result of self.bless though, no?

[11:26] <lizmat> yup

[11:26] <tadzik> right

[11:27] <lizmat> or you can haz a TWEAK :-)

[12:25] * PimDaniel lizmat:  "inside the .new method, there is no object yet, just a type so you cannot access any attribute yet" : i know this yet and that's a bit what i'm trying to explain to tadzik.

[12:26] <lizmat> :-)

[12:27] * PimDaniel tadzik: you can transform any .new method parameter but you can't touch any class attribute so you can't share anything at this step.

[12:27] <tadzik> what are you starting each of your messages with a /me? :)

[12:30] <PimDaniel> Only TWEAK acts has is, but afterwords, because TWEAK is just a method self triggered after after any constructor.

[12:31] <PimDaniel> i don't know what does me:

[12:32] <PimDaniel> i searched for the instruction that make me appear in yellow.

[12:33] <PimDaniel> This is easier ton interpell a particular person. 

[12:34] <PimDaniel> I looked at Irssi Help on my Linux but did not understand which method people use to appear in yellow. Like Lizmat did into this message: inside the .new method, there is no object yet, just a type

[12:34] <PimDaniel> at 13:23

[12:35] <PimDaniel> One day lizmat told me that it was /me.

[12:35] <PimDaniel> But may be i did not well understand or the opposite.

[12:35] <PimDaniel> Why is me so borring?

[12:37] <MasterDuke> putting /me at the beginning puts your username at the start. but if you want to trigger notification of someone else, usually you just put their username and a colon.

[12:37] * MasterDuke is demonstrating that /me at the beginning is replaced with my username

[12:38] <PimDaniel> yess but Masterduke does not appear in yellow.

[12:38] <MasterDuke> PimDaniel: but putting your username at the beginning will likely highlight this message in your client

[12:39] <PimDaniel> Yess now MasterDuke is yellow colored.

[12:40] <PimDaniel> what is a colon? this --> :

[12:40] <MasterDuke> you can probably configure your client how you want, but those are the standard conventions (use /me if talking about yourself, use <username>: to cause a message to be highlighted for someone else)

[12:41] <PimDaniel> MasterDuke: Do i appear higlighted?

[12:42] <MasterDuke> the entire message is

[12:42] <PimDaniel> Why? What dit i miss?

[12:43] <PimDaniel> :MasterDuke is it ok now?

[12:43] *** jmerelo left
[12:44] <MasterDuke> it's the same. this client highlights an entire message if my username is anywhere in it (and yes, my username is printed in a different color). there is the option to only highlight if a message starts with the username though

[12:47] <PimDaniel> MasterDuke do you mean without colon?

[12:48] <PimDaniel> \h

[12:48] <PimDaniel> help

[12:48] <MasterDuke> yeah. so both "MasterDuke do you mean without colon?" and "Yess now MasterDuke is yellow colored." are highlighted for me

[12:52] <PimDaniel> Sorry, not clear: You say that the entire line is colored or just your Name? Or are thez colored in different colors or what?

[12:52] <PimDaniel> I looked at the web page but nothing is really colored.

[12:54] <MasterDuke> a normal message has a white background with black text. when my username is in a message the entire message has a gray background with black text and my username is in color

[13:01] <PimDaniel> MasterDuke ok thank you very mutch. I get nearly the same except that message are allways in the same intensity: low white on black. only Names may appear higligted and/or colored. Thank's.

[13:01] <MasterDuke> np

[13:02] <PimDaniel> PimDaniel i test something.

[13:02] <PimDaniel> Does not work.

[13:03] <PimDaniel> PimDaniel: I test another thing.

[13:03] <PimDaniel> No more.

[13:03] <PimDaniel> Bon nevermind.

[13:04] <jjatria> PimDaniel: If I start a message with your name, it will be highlighted for you. If you do it with my name, it will be highlighted for me. If you do it with your own name, I guess it doesn't need highlighting, so it doesn't

[13:10] <PimDaniel> jjatria If i tried this it's because I understood exacly the opposite from MasterDuke. 14:38 message yellowed. PimDaniel: but putting your username at the ...

[13:11] <PimDaniel> Well nevermind : this will suffice. Thank's to all of you for your help!

[15:22] <summerisle> after poking around i've determined that even if writing a comprehensive lexer for emacs is out of the question due to performance requirements surrounding indent-line-function (it gets run a whole lot) it's likely more straightforward to replace the current raku-mode line-indent-function with something homebrew as opposed to SMIE. It would be nice to use CC-mode's engine; however, it seems pretty embedded and if it's possible to build other modes with it it isn't

[15:22] <summerisle>  terribly well documented for that purpose.

[15:23] <summerisle> cperl-mode is as complicated as it is because of cruft for _very_ old emacs support, afaict. and there's little point in borrowing from it.

[17:11] <codesections> do both of those RHS ~Date.… lines run ok by themselves for you?

[17:12] <jdv79> yeah

[17:14] <codesections> aha, I can reproduce.  It requires splitting into two files, as in your second paste

[18:39] <japhb> 't compare to a type object that way.

[18:40] <japhb> FEK

[18:44] <jdv79> yeah, that golfing isn't equiv

[18:45] <jdv79> i'd have to guess it might be something about the * and not dates but i'll try to look later maybe

[19:07] <jdv79> what is the intent of ".ACCEPTS: True" in this context?

[19:09] <daemon> hey all this might seem a bit of a trolly question but please bear with me, in terms of processing JSON data from a websocket or alternatively JSON objects straight from a TCP connection, which would be capable of doing more object processing per second, perl5 or raku

[19:10] <jdv79> Perl

[19:10] <daemon> cool thank you jdv79 

[19:12] <codesections> jdv79: it distinguishes between  parameters MAIN that accept True as an argument (and thus can be called from the CLI with a flag like `./fetcher --flag`, that is without an argument, which is the same as --flag=True) from those that *must* have an argument
