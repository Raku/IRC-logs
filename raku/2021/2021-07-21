[00:06] <ugexe> SmokeMachine: seems liek a rakudo regression

[00:08] <raydiak> I can reproduce, latest zef does indeed seem to be broken on current rakudo HEAD

[00:09] <raydiak> as far as I can tell, the commonality seems to be that modules with dependencies fail, while modules with an empty depends array install successfully

[00:13] <raydiak> I'm trying to hunt it down to something easily bisected, but here is a stack trace: https://gist.github.com/raydiak/df9f588424f9f24ed423c62a1d74d963

[00:36] <ugexe> its definitely that commit though

[00:37] <raydiak> right...I guess the question then is why .dist.api is now always `()` at https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Repository.rakumod#L149

[00:39] <raydiak> that's the line triggering the error. yes the message changed with that recent cmp optimization, but that doesn't explain why it wasn't manifesting the other errors before, does it?

[01:34] <justsomeguy> Hi #raku. I just read through a few dozen examples of different programming tasks on rosettacode and noticed that raku is consistently the most expressive language among all of the examples listed. That's pretty impressive.

[01:41] <raydiak> hello, justsomeguy. wide dynamic range of expression was a core concept of the design from the very start, and an enormous amount of work has gone into making it a useful reality

[01:41] <raydiak> so thanks for noticing :)

[09:33] <perlmaros> hi, how do i stack promises in raku? chaining via .then does not quite work as expected. I've compiled three examples - one in p5, one in javascript and one in raku - to illustrate my point. 

[09:33] <perlmaros> https://gist.github.com/maros/d9f5a8d1cc6d96f374f0c45e22e7ab0a

[09:35] <perlmaros> p5 (ugly, very verbose and requires cpan modules) and javascript behave as expected. raku immediately passes the new promise to the second chained then, instead of waiting for the resolution of the promise and passing only the result to the next then.

[09:47] *** Doc_Holliwould joined
[09:57] <perlmaros> (also see https://promisesaplus.com/#point-41 and https://promisesaplus.com/#point-49 also shows the excpected behaviour)

[10:05] <raydiak> I don't claim to have a ton of experience with promises, but I don't think 'return' does what you're expecting there. the second then receives a promise which is kept after the first then block has finished executing, not the promise you're returning from the first block. as far I can tell, any return in the then block causes its resulting promise to be broken instead of kept, and otherwise does...seemingly

[10:05] <raydiak> nothing?

[10:05] <raydiak> https://docs.rakulang.site/type/Promise#method_then is rather short on details

[10:06] <moon-child> perlmaros: http://sprunge.us/W7C1XK

[10:08] *** ufobat__ left
[10:10] <raydiak> https://docs.rakulang.site/language/concurrency#Promises has some more details. everywhere I see it used, the resulting value of then's promise is the last value in the block, but not actually returned by `return`

[10:12] <rba> raydiak: please always refer to docs.raku.org. rakulang.site is only for backup. 

[10:14] <lizmat> note that `return` returns from the surrounding *sub*, **NOT** from the block it is in

[10:15] <lizmat> `leave` has been specced for that, but nobody has implemented that yet

[10:15] <lizmat> m: leave

[10:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar efb3116a9: OUTPUT: «leave not yet implemented. Sorry.␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[10:17] <lizmat> perlmaros: remove the `return` from your example, and it seems to do what you want?

[10:19] <raydiak> rba: sorry, my mistake. I usually fix that before pasting, just forgot to this time. I always have to use rakulang.site because of comcast screwery. they have been completely unresponsive to my request on that, btw

[10:24] <perlmaros> raydiak/lizmat: removing the return clause gets rid of the exception, but i still only get the Promise object in the second then

[10:26] <raydiak> .then() creates its own entirely separate promise, so the second .then is getting the promise you're explicitly returning from the first one as the .result of the first .then's promise

[10:27] <perlmaros> raydiak: yes, the example from your paste works, but imho then blocks should be agnostic to the way they are invoked. so at least according to the promise a+ spec a new promise returned by the then block should NOT be passed directly to the next then, but only once it kept/broken

[10:30] <mykhal> what's a+ ?

[10:31] *** dogbert17 joined
[10:31] <raydiak> the second block doesn't run until after the first one finishes running, which is what keeps its promise. its promise is kept with a .result value of the .in(2) promise you are explicitly creating. that could have just as well been "foobar" or any other value, you just happen to be handing it a promise. if you're looking for a 2 seond delay between the two, you could add a .then({sleep 2}) to the middle of the

[10:31] <raydiak> cain, for example

[10:32] *** dogbert11 left
[10:32] <rba> raydiak: got it. Strange thing thats it‘s still not working.

[10:32] <raydiak> or moon-child++'s solution in that paste was to await on the promise you're passing along, then call .result.result to get the result from the promise you created in the second block, which itself was the result of the first .then block's promise

[10:35] <raydiak> rba: it turns out that it's a bizarre symptom of comcast doing a really weird way of blocking a site. in my research there were tons of legitimate sites complaining about being impacted by this. comcast is just doing their usual craptastic job of...pretty much everything

[10:37] <perlmaros> mykhal: the promise a+ spec is followed by many languages/modules https://promisesaplus.com

[10:39] <perlmaros> and afaict the second block is invoked imediately - so in my case it does not wait 2 seconds. only if i run await on the promise i got there

[10:41] <perlmaros> i know that this can be solved using sleep/await/... but it feels kind of akward and adds this extra complexity to the code

[10:42] <raydiak> that's what I'm saying. it runs directly after the first block, and receives the promise implicitly created and kept by .then(), not the promise you're explicitly creating...that one ends up as the value in the first block's promise's .result

[10:47] <perlmaros> in the javascript and perl examples the then block is always called with the result value - regardless if if came from an previous promise, or if it came from the original keep/resolve. in raku it behaves differently - raku' behaviour leads to more complex code because my then code needs to know how it was invoked, which makes chaining promise harder

[10:48] <perlmaros> and personally i don't see an advantage to returning the raw value here.

[10:51] <raydiak> yes, raku gives you the promise itself, not the result of the promise. you have to call .result yourself. I'd imagine the advantage is that you can also check the .status/.cause kind of stuff. but like I said, I'm definitely no expert in this area

[10:52] <raydiak> e.g. if the first promise throws an exception, the second one is still called and can check for that and respond appropriately

[11:05] <lizmat> channeling jnthn: Raku doesn't do the "unwrapping"/"flattening" thing that JavaScript Promises do by design. I consider the JavaScript way a mistake.

[11:05] <lizmat> While we borrowed the name Promise because it's more Raku-ish than the .Net Task<T>, semantically we're far closer to the latter.

[11:05] <lizmat> </channeling>

[11:07] *** dogbert11 joined
[11:08] *** dogbert17 left
[11:09] <raydiak> I recall it being a thoroughly-considered design, but any specifics as to why our way is better? perlmaros is saying it means he now has to write `.then({do-stuff(.result)})` instead of `.then(&do-stuff)` if do-stuff() is just a normal routine expecting a normal value instead of a promise

[11:09] <raydiak> the only one I could think of was exception handling, but I don't really use promises myself

[15:43] <Altreus> oh. I expected something like, they're implemented in C and it's easier to stick to C's syntax requirements

[15:43] <Altreus> or maybe, they were written before we decided to allow - in identifiers!

[16:14] <ugexe> so having looked into this promise thing more... my impression is some people in javascript are regretting their decision with the rise in popularity of typescript

[16:15] <Altreus> This sounds divisive

[16:16] <ugexe> the non flattening implementation was deemed too language and type theoryist, hence why typescript rising popularity is exposing this change in sentiment

[16:16] <ugexe> at the time it was deemed^

[16:17] <Altreus> My understanding is that JS will automatically unpack a promise for a .then function?

[16:17] <ugexe> yeah

[16:17] <Altreus> I can see the appeal
