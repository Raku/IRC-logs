[17:00] <tbrowder> speaking of macs, i just fired up an old mac mini my son gave me, and it is now a virgin installation ready for a raku install, with git, emacs, etc.

[17:01] <tbrowder> can anyone recommend a good book on mac os for linux users?

[17:03] <El_Che> I don't think a book is needed

[17:03] <El_Che> you'll spend most of the time making the environment tolerable for developing :)

[17:04] <El_Che> install homebrew so you can get rakudo and lots of utils

[17:05] <El_Che> this may interest you: https://podman.io/blogs/2021/09/06/podman-on-macs.html

[17:05] <El_Che> with podman you can run docker containers

[17:06] <El_Che> On more complex projects I have a script to launch containers with e.g. mysql and keycloak

[17:06] <El_Che> so I can run more complicated tests

[17:06] <El_Che> (I hide those with a env AUTHOR_TESTING)

[17:06] <El_Che> I develop like that on linux, and this week I was sitting on macos and could not run those extended tests

[17:07] <El_Che> so now I have workaround :)

[17:12] *** sm2 joined
[17:14] <El_Che> so, there you go, my verbosity looks like the beginning of a book :)

[17:23] *** jess left
[17:31] <tbrowder> t’anks! El_Che

[17:59] <ugexe> i just use rakubrew on linux, mac, and windows

[17:59] <ugexe> even if I only ever used one installation i would still do it this way

[18:02] *** reportable6 left
[18:09] *** sftp joined
[18:19] <perryprog> And depending on how strict you like the unix philosophy, you may find macports preferable, but homebrew is generally more popular (homebrew is what I use)

[18:20] <perryprog> But besides that the linux-macos transition is usually pretty easy

[18:21] <El_Che> tbrowder: I have a common .profile and .bashrc for my linux and mac machines

[18:23] <El_Che> tbrowder: I do a if [ $HOME == "/home/$USER" ]; then ... else ... fi for macos specific things

[18:25] <El_Che> I used to put specific macos ssh-add config there, but knowadays I let keepassxc connect to ssh-agent on desktop linux and macos

[18:40] <CIAvash> patrickb: I don't know what you are trying to do exactly, but do you mean something like this: `my @foo; for <a b c> -> $a { @foo.push: -> $ where * eqv $a { say $a } }; @foo[0]('a')` or do you need it to be compile-time?

[18:43] <patrickb> CIAvash: Yes, that's what I was aiming for.

[18:45] <patrickb> See https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-router#Serving_static_content_from_resources I have static stuff in <css img js> and was trying to not having to copy the block three times.

[18:47] <tbrowder> El_Che: i use bash on linux, is that avail?

[18:48] <tbrowder> looks like you use a diff user name on the 2 hosts…

[18:49] <tbrowder> or

[18:53] <lizmat> tbrowder: you can also just install Debian on a MacMini  :-)

[18:54] *** sm2 left
[18:55] <tbrowder> i know, but i want the mac os so i can see problems my classmates have with my website. they say they can’t see it because of TLS cert probs.

[18:55] <lizmat> I see... ok  :-)

[18:57] <tbrowder> if you get a chance could you please see if you on a mac can browse to <https://usafa-1965.org> successfully?

[18:58] <tbrowder> my mac guys are not comp savvy enough to give me great clues on their problems.

[19:02] <tbrowder> the site uses tls for login to a private area but most of the site is accessible to all on windows and linux. just mac ppl report NO access anywhere.

[19:04] <tbrowder> *tls private site cert with individual user keys

[19:06] <tbrowder> also with the mac i hope to add a novice mac user for raku to the rakoon club

[19:06] *** whatnext joined

[19:07] <tbrowder> or should that really be “rakuun”?

[19:08] *** AntonOks left
[19:09] <El_Che> tbrowder: bash is available, but zsh is now the default

[19:10] <El_Che> I keep using bash though

[19:10] <El_Che> and different users is no problm, use the $USER bariable

[19:10] <El_Che> v

[19:10] <CIAvash> patrickb: I think there may be different ways to tackle it, maybe: `sub f ($resource, *@path) { dd $resource, @path }; my @resources = <css img js>.map: { &f.assuming: $_ }; @resources[0]('a')`

[19:10] <El_Che> I also have different users, the mac is managed by it

[19:11] <whatnext> hi all :)  today I have a maths question. Probably I am doing sthg goofy, however, I have some code like this: `$m = $a / $b; say "$a $b $m";` with results like `14 16 0.0625`. Obviously `14/16` is not `0.0625` so I wonder what is going on? Something to do with types? dividing with the wrong char? Anyone shed any light? :) 

[19:11] <tellable6> 2021-11-11T01:04:03Z #raku <SmokeMachine> whatnext Would you mind to test it? I think it will make your code work (I still have a lot to review and probably fix, but probably that problem Is fixed): https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/526

[19:16] <[Coke]> m: my $a=14; my $b=16; my $m = $a / $b; say "$a $b $m"

[19:16] <[Coke]> ^^ Either your golf missed a step or you have a very broken raku

[19:17] <whatnext> lol.. it's pretty weird I have to say - certainly wasn't expecting it

[19:44] <japhb> .0625 is 1/16 ... so I'm guessing a missing '4' somewhere.

[19:51] <CIAvash> patrickb: so if I understood you correctly, the easiest way would be `get -> $resource where <css img js>.any, *@path { resource $resource, @path }`

[19:52] <patrickb> CIAvash: Right. I didn't think of that, kinda obvious. Thanks!

[21:04] <bartolin> tbrowder: regarding the potential TLS problem with your site: This smells like a problem with an expired Root Certificate that is still referenced by your Let's Encrypt certificate. This is a somewhat complex, but IMHO this blog post explains it quite good: https://scotthelme.co.uk/lets-encrypt-old-root-expiration/

[21:13] <bartolin> tbrowder: As far as I understand that particular problem will affect mostly (some) old clients. But maybe that's the case here. You can see the problem with the following command: 'echo QUIT | openssl s_client -connect usafa-1965.org:443 -showcerts'. The last certificate in the chain refers to the expired DST Root CA X3. (quite OT, but since I read about this topic in September I thought I could mention it ...)

[21:14] <tbrowder> bartolin: thnx, i remember that thread from earlier but decided i couldn’t do  much about it at the moment.

[21:16] <tbrowder> i did a tldr on the link, but i don’t think there is anything i can do for my friends if they have probs.

[21:18] <tbrowder> but, duh, i haven’t yet tried access from my own mini (i mutter as i slap forehead)!…..

[21:19] <bartolin> probably not. Let's Encrpyt offers an alternative chain, but old clients will probably have problems with that as well (if the expired cert is the culprint). Upgrading the clients is the real solution.

[21:40] <japhb> bartolin: If only device vendors supported updates to older devices ....  :-(

[21:41] <perryprog> pretty sure macOS has a basic workaround for manually trusting a newer CA

[21:44] *** greaser|q is now known as GreaseMonkey

[21:47] <perryprog> I /think/ (take this with a large grain of salt) you should just be able to download the cross-signed .pem for ISRG Root X1 on https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/ and drag-and-drop that into Keychain Acess

[21:49] <perryprog> see also 

[21:49] <perryprog> see also* https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/this-certificate-was-signed-by-an-unknown-authority/13878/2

[21:53] *** A26F64 left
[21:56] <El_Che> the only real solution for old clients that don't receive updates, like old phones. is root them and install a supported os

[21:57] <patrickb> How can I coerce a Str to an enum of the same name?

[21:58] <timo> m: say Bool::{"True"}

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0b971721: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[22:02] <patrickb> timo: Thanks

[22:07] <tbrowder> perryprog: thnx, i can probably help the guys with that after i check out on my mac. BUT i powered up my mac when i left here at 1518 and it’s now 1602 and the progress bar under the apple looks complete but no further action!

[22:08] <tbrowder> the display, ms, and kb are on a kvm switch and it all powered up intially on it just fine…bummer

[22:11] <perryprog> tbrowder is that an update progress bar or just the "I'm rebooting" progress bar?

[22:11] <perryprog> if it's an update one, it can take quite some time. Otherwise I'd give it another hour before hard restarting it.

[22:13] <El_Che> my it-managed mac has an 18h record on an update (on a fast line)

[22:14] <El_Che> (I upgrade my work ubuntu way faster than that :) )

[22:15] <El_Che> tbrowder: in case you need to reinstall it, mac have a nice bootmode where you can reinstall it from the internet

[22:17] <tbrowder> ok, thx. so do you usually lv it powered on? i don’t normally power down except when leaving for for days away from home.

[22:18] <perryprog> Yeah I usually leave a mini powered on

[22:18] <El_Che> during the update, yes. Normally: no. It's laptop that I don't use often

[22:18] <tbrowder> and this is a brand new xperience fr me

[22:25] <El_Che> it's fun
