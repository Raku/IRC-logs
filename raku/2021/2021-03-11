[09:51] <PimDaniel> \o everybody!

[09:56] *** tadzik joined
[09:57] <PimDaniel> I can symbolize a variable like this : my $what='thisvar'; $which='thatvar'; my $thisvar='I am beautifull'; my $thatvar='I am the best'; then you can write say $::($what) which says $thisvar content. How would i express it for a class variable : $instance.a.x  but can be $instance.a.y ?

[09:58] <PimDaniel> Thank's in advance.

[09:58] <PimDaniel> I hope i was clear.

[10:01] <tyil> PimDaniel: https://p.tyil.nl/r0qj would this answer your question?

[10:06] * PimDaniel  Thank's tyil At a first watch, i think so. I'll give a try but i think it is ok.

[18:14] <CesareoAguirre> Hello. Im from Mexico and, since years, about to put hands on Perl again... well, now is Raku. If you want to join https://t.me/RakuLangMX well you probably found more questions than answers for now, but I want to spend at least an hour a day on this..

[18:31] <tellable6> jmerelo, I haven't seen salortiz around, did you mean sortiz?

[18:32] <jmerelo> .seen sortiz

[18:32] <tellable6> jmerelo, I saw sortiz 2021-03-02T16:41:09Z in #raku: <sortiz> summerisle, In particular can be used for complex "returns" constraints.

[18:40] <jmerelo> CesareoAguirre: Well, Perl is alive and kicking. And Raku is a wonderful language you'll surely enjoy using.

[19:04] <neshpion> i want to use raku but i can't think of a reason why, i just cobble horrible bash scripts for everything.  how can i convince myself to not torture myself?

[19:10] <summerisle> at some point i was forced to jump from bash to perl 5 when i needed to do something that required greater performance than bash could provide. one of the biggest killer features for me to begin with was combining -ne/-pe with regular expressions and the topic variable. i imagine finding a similar "killer feature" would help.

[19:10] <summerisle> what are you using bash scripts for neshpion

[19:10] *** rindolf left
[19:12] <neshpion> most recently i had one to take deviantart URLs and grab the deviation id => query API => find image source => wget, and that could probably be written in something that isn't horrible, and its corollary would check the dimensions of all the downloaded images and automatically symlink the square-or-wider ones to my wallpapers directory

[19:21] <neshpion> another one i have launches ffmpeg for screen recording, it does some disgusting bash string manipulation and saves previous filenames to a cache file, adds sequential numbers to filenames, and launches ffmpeg for different tasks depending on what the desired output filename is

[19:21] <neshpion> i'm pretty scared of that one but *it works* :D

[20:58] <summerisle> neshpion: both of those are definitely good use cases. the xml/html parsers I have used tend to be OK as long as (X)HTML is correctly formed (e.g. NOT using SGML features), otherwise weird stuff happens. DA is probably fine for that.

[21:02] <gfldex> I'm working in customer care for a largish cell phone provider. Saldy, I must report that most phones are smarter then their owners.

[21:02] <jdv79> yeah, xml wasnt put in its place at that point.  sgml and xml, ugh.

[22:15] <neshpion> i'm fine with the idea of carrying a powerful touchscreen computer in my pocket, but not fine with its behavior being dictated by proprietary hardware and software

[22:22] <gfldex> A while ago the german goverment made a big fuzz about a new app that one can use to report holes in the coverage of the mobile phone network.

[22:22] <gfldex> One big sham.

[22:22] <gfldex> We know exactly where those holes are because we can see your phone disapear when it leaves the reach of the cell tower down to a dozen meters.

[22:23] <gfldex> When beam forming comes with 5G we can dial in on your position down to a meter or two.
