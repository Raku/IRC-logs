[01:01] <Froogal> Hi!  I'm trying to compile Rakudo-star but for some reason Configure.pl isn't in the .tar when I extract the files.  But one of the steps is to run Configure.pl.

[01:03] *** HarmtH_ left
[01:05] <Froogal> PS: I'm following these steps https://rakudo.org/star/source

[01:09] <codesections> Froogal: I've never installed Rakudo Star from source, so I can't offer much help.  Those instructions look pretty different from the ones in the README, though, https://github.com/rakudo/star.  Maybe those would work better?

[01:11] <codesections> (There is a Configure.pl in the Rakudo repo/source tarball -- and I have used that one without issue.  Maybe star used to be the same but isn't anymore?)

[01:11] <Froogal> codesections wow thats much different lol.  Let me give it a try.  Thank you :)

[01:11] <Froogal> yes it looks like you just run a bin in rakudo/bin/

[01:13] <[Coke]> If you're willing to compile from source, I'd compile rakudo, not r-star

[01:54] <Froogal> It seems those Rakudo compile instructions are old.

[15:14] <[Coke]> (the difference) r-star bundles a specific version of rakudo/nqp/MoarVM/modules. when you build rakudo, even from a tagged release, you are probably getting a slightly newer version of the first three (but depends on where in the release schedule we are), and you have to install the modules you want yoursel.

[15:28] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh, neat

[15:29] <RaycatWhoDat> I would like to throw my hat into the ring for a website redesign. I haven't worked on it in a while but I might be able to do something here

[15:30] <RaycatWhoDat> Once upon a time, I made this: https://raymperry.github.io/raku-fansite/

[15:31] <RaycatWhoDat> I'll be refining it over the weekend

[16:48] <summerisle> i was using comma just to see how well it worked - i was suprised to see that its intellisense implementation for raku has a lot of false positives

[16:48] *** Nasrudin left
[16:49] <summerisle> i think some edument guys hang out in here, so i was just curious - is that normal? there's a subroutine in one package declared export(:API) and that package is then use'd with the :API category. this is valid at runtime but static(?) analysis in comma seems to think it doesn't exist

[16:50] <summerisle> nonetheless, there's little reason not to use emacs

[16:50] <summerisle> anyways*
