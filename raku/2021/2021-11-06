[16:36] <japhb> Trying to figure out status on the URI install issue: I saw ugexe fixed zef's confusion about URI versus URI::Template.  I know [Coke] noticed the same install problems with URI that I did, and jonathanstowe confirmed it was most likely a Rakudo regression, not a URI change (since there haven't been any).  Was there any progress after that?

[16:37] *** suman joined
[16:37] <suman> Suppose I have a hash my %new_hash = {"madam" => 4, "sir" => 1, "student" => 3};

[16:37] <suman> How to print the keys with higher values in this case: get the keys madam and student

[16:39] <japhb> m: my %new_hash = madam => 4, sir => 1, student => 3; .say for %new_hash.sort(*.value).head(2);

[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´sir => 1‚ê§student => 3‚ê§¬ª

[16:39] <japhb> m: my %new_hash = madam => 4, sir => 1, student => 3; .say for %new_hash.sort(-*.value).head(2);

[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´madam => 4‚ê§student => 3‚ê§¬ª

[16:39] <japhb> (Forgot to reverse the sort direction)

[16:40] <suman> @japhb Rather than elements of hash, I just wish to get the last two highest keys 

[16:41] <japhb> m: my %new_hash = madam => 4, sir => 1, student => 3; .key.say for %new_hash.sort(-*.value).head(2);

[16:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´madam‚ê§student‚ê§¬ª

[16:41] <japhb> Or

[16:41] <japhb> m: my %new_hash = madam => 4, sir => 1, student => 3; .say for %new_hash.sort(-*.value).head(2).map(*.key);

[16:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´madam‚ê§student‚ê§¬ª

[16:42] <suman> (y) 

[16:42] <japhb> (Technically it is possible to determine k-th greatest faster than sorting the whole array (by partitioning), but doesn't seem worth the hassle here.)

[16:44] <suman> If you have time, it would be great to see that solution too '=D 

[16:46] <japhb> I don't think we have convenient optimized built-ins for that ... it would require writing out the partition algorithm by hand.  Not conceptually difficult, but famously easy to make non-obvious mistakes and get off-by-one errors and such.

[16:47] <japhb> Unless your hash has a LOT of elements (at least thousands), I'd just stick with the (fairly well-written) sort routine.

[16:59] <suman> @japhb Can you please tell me how to print keys who have specific values. If a hash has value=1, then it will print all keys with value 1.

[17:00] <suman> my %hash={abc => 1, bcd => 1, cde => 1, def => 1, efg => 1};

[17:00] <suman> here it has to print all keys because all have val=1

[17:01] <lizmat> feels like we're doing someone's home work  :-)

[17:02] <lizmat> m: my %a = :1a,:1b,:2c,:3d; say %a.map: { .key if .value == 1 }

[17:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b)‚ê§¬ª

[17:03] <suman> Haha no no, I was looking to solve k-mer problem in bioinformatics in rakuish way '=D 

[17:05] <ugexe> m: my %foo = a => 1, b => 1, c => 3; say %foo.categorize(*.value, :as(*.key))<1>

[17:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´(Any)‚ê§¬ª

[17:06] <ugexe> m: my %foo = a => 1, b => 1, c => 3; say %foo.categorize(*.value, :as(*.key)){1}

[17:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar e98e17da7: OUTPUT: ¬´[a b]‚ê§¬ª
