[15:17] <tbrowder> duh, i just noticed the use of 'rakudo' or 'raku' as the executable. which is preferred? which is best to use when talking to possible adaptors?

[15:19] <ugexe> raku

[15:19] <tbrowder> i guess we're saying 'rakudo' is a compiler for 'raku' like 'gcc' is a compiler for 'c'?

[15:20] <tbrowder> ok, back to my cave embracing 'raku' :-D

[15:21] <tbrowder> thnx nick

[16:31] <[Coke]> in docs, it makes sense to push raku. for internal use inside  rakudo, rakudo seems best.

[18:09] <tbrowder> the reason i asked is on #raku-dev they're changing perl6 to rakudo in the shebang line

[18:10] <tbrowder> so i thought that might eventually be picked up by public scripts

[18:12] *** dataangel joined
[18:12] <[Coke]> yes. that's in rakudo guts, so it makes sense to use rakudo there, no?

[18:30] <lizmat> ah, good point!

[18:34] <[Coke]> anyone else find the REPL on windows broken?

[18:34] *** spycrab0 joined
[18:34] <[Coke]> I type "raku" and it just hangs. I am not yet patient enough to get the intro text or a prompt

[18:35] *** kawaii joined
[18:41] <[Coke]> ... weird. comes up fine in a 'x64 native tools command prompt' (except for the incorrectly rendered unicode characters), but in a git bash window, it hangs

[18:42] <[Coke]> lizmat: should we not use the unicode characters in the prompt on windows? 

[18:42] <[Coke]> s/prompt/REPL/

[18:43] <[Coke]> it's either mojibake, or if you use chcp 65001, it's ???????TM v2021.04

[18:43] <lizmat> nope, the unicode characters are intentional oin the repl only

[18:43] <lizmat> perhaps we should not do this on Windows, as apparently close to nobody has their terminal set up to handle UTF-8 on WIndows

[19:45] <whatnext> hello all... I have yet another very basic question :)

[19:47] <whatnext> how do I call a method stored in a variable. e.g. $object.$method() seemed the obvious way to do it (to me!) but that seems to do something else

[19:47] <whatnext> any clues? :)

[19:49] <ugexe> $object."$method"()

[19:50] <whatnext> ah really - interesting... thanks!

[20:07] <lizmat> the parentheses in that example are mandatory

[20:07] <lizmat> even if you don't pass any arguments

[20:07] <lizmat> basically the same rule as in interpolation of sub calls

[20:08] <lizmat> m: sub a() { "foo" }; say "&a()bar"
