[00:13] <tonyo> [Coke]: ? what's up with houston?

[00:17] <tbrowder> my prob with houston is it’s so BIG

[00:18] <tbrowder> hard for a country boy to find his way around

[00:21] *** jmcgnh joined
[00:22] *** holyghost left
[00:25] <tonyo> where are you from tbrowder ?

[00:28] <tbrowder> i now live in gulf breeze, florida. lived in fl since 1985. born in sandersville, ga. lived in four countries outside us. one of my best friends lived in houston until he passed last year.

[00:28] <tonyo> ah, sorry to hear

[00:30] <tbrowder> thnx. actually, i had talked bill into going to the tpc in houston in 2020 until it got cancelled.

[00:31] <tbrowder> he was a hard-core windows guy even though he had wrked for ibm in his younger days.

[00:32] <tbrowder> i was trying to get him to learn raku but he wasn’t real excited about it

[00:33] <tbrowder> but he loved conferences—a real ppl guy

[00:34] <tbrowder> he would have been a good used-car salesman

[00:50] <tbrowder> tonyo: did i see somewhere you live in tx, or was that ca?

[00:51] <tonyo> i live up in oregon.  originally from michigan..just got back from the woods milling some beams for a green wood sauna

[00:52] <tonyo> i think ugexe lives in tx, though

[01:00] <guifa> My guess is that after organizing it for 2020 and 2021 and each getting cancelled, allt he work had already been done, it was mostly just changing around dates with the hosts, etc.

[01:00] <guifa> ngl houston works well for me since I've got some friends down there I can see before/during/after.

[01:06] <guifa> "Lexical with name '$foo' has a different type in this frame"  — any idea what this means?  I double checked and the types are the same

[02:32] <[Coke]> issue not with Houston specifically, but TX in general. I personally have an issue with their recent abortion ban.

[02:42] <melezhik> I am working on Sparky Job Api at the moment , if someone is curios. It's pretty experimental, but allows to do an interesting stuff for CICD pipelines - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky#job-api - like running recursive builds and asynchronously wait them using `supply` subscription model ...

[02:43] <melezhik> also doing things in "fork" style - it's not a process fork, but Sparky scenario fork ...

[02:45] *** melezhik left
[02:45] <guifa> [Coke]: Understandable, but Houston itself is quite different from the greater state.  Basically same thing we get around my parts with Atlanta vs GA

[03:04] <[Coke]> Yup, used to live in Houston.

[03:05] <[Coke]> I still need to make my concerns known. Wish I had a PM group here that we could offer to put together a hosting proposal in the future.

[09:32] <TheAthlete> @array.map: some_code

[09:32] <andinus> , check the docs for map

[09:33] <andinus> `@array.map: some_code` is same as @array.map(some_code)

[09:33] <andinus> m: put (1...5).map: * + 1

[09:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb16f7ecc: OUTPUT: «2 3 4 5 6␤»

[09:33] <andinus> m: put (1...5).map(* + 1)

[09:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb16f7ecc: OUTPUT: «2 3 4 5 6␤»

[09:33] <andinus> just an alternate syntax

[09:36] *** holyghost joined
[09:37] <moon-child> TheAthlete: https://docs.raku.org/language/syntax#Precedence_drop

[09:38] <TheAthlete> Thank you!

[09:39] <qorg11> Why does assigning a variable to Nil and then printing it gives (Any) instead of Nil?

[09:40] <andinus> https://docs.raku.org/type/Nil#index-entry-Nil_assignment

[09:42] <moon-child> m: my $x := Nil; say $x; my \x = Nil; say x

[09:42] <qorg11> m: my Int $x = Nil; $x.say;

[09:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb16f7ecc: OUTPUT: «(Int)␤»

[09:42] <qorg11> Hm

[09:43] <qorg11> Well, i guess it makes sense, as in C anything can point to NULL, regardless its type

[09:47] <qorg11> how is the equivalent of @INC called in raku?

[09:47] <qorg11> like the directories from the modules are

[09:47] <moon-child> what is @INC?

[09:47] <qorg11> where the modules are*

[09:48] *** evalable6 joined
[09:48] <qorg11> @INC is an array which contains the directories where perl looks for modules

[10:54] <El_Che> something changed related to directories in this release?  error creating directory './opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/short': No such file or directory

[10:55] <El_Che> while unpacking a deb

[10:55] <lizmat_> El_Che: doesn't ring a bell with me

[10:55] *** TempIRCLogger left
[10:56] <El_Che> I added this in the past for a workaround around zef-rakudo problems:

[10:56] <El_Che> # Empty folders your package may need created. (overridable)

[10:56] <El_Che> empty_folders: - /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/short - /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/vendor/short

[10:56] <El_Che> # Empty folders your package may need created. (overridable)

[10:57] <El_Che> in short, I package those folders as well while they are empty

[10:57] *** lizmat left
[10:57] <El_Che> debian/ubuntu does not like that anymore because they may no longer exist

[10:57] <El_Che> can someone with a fresh build check if they still exist?

[10:58] *** TempIRCLogger__ left

[12:16] <tellable6> 2021-12-24T02:31:08Z #raku <[Coke]> tbrowder ok, I'll re-revert. Please run tests before pushing in future.

[12:17] <tbrowder> if so, you’ll have to shun me…

[12:22] <Altai-man> tbrowder, was there a recent drama I'm not aware of or how so?

[12:23] <Altai-man> AFAIK the rule of the thumb is still in terms of "be nice to people" here, not sure if it changed.

[12:25] <tbrowder> some ppl giving views on abortion and how it affects going to certain parts of the country

[12:28] <Altai-man> it's their right to give those, I think it's also yours to give yours. whether you go quarrelling about this it's another, but arguably falls under the "be nice" thing. and if people decide to quarrel over politics more, then it's already an offtopic, and an unpleasant ones.

[12:30] <SmokeMachine> m: say @*INC

[12:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb16f7ecc: OUTPUT: «Dynamic variable @*INC not found␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:30] <Altai-man> having opinions is alright, keeping the atmosphere of kinship here, sharing little details of life, is alright (we're not robots here, at least I'm not). severe offtopic and flame is not nice, thus not ok.

[12:31] <Altai-man> that's only my opinion, though

[12:35] <lizmat> Altai-man++

[12:38] <lizmat> tbrowder: afaik, [Coke]  just gave his view and reasoning that mean that *he* will not go to Houston

[12:38] <lizmat> tbrowder: fwiw, I won't be going there either, and the reasoning [Coke] gave is only one of them

[12:40] <lizmat> tbrowder: the bathroom laws in TX just make me feel insecure, and having friends in TX being told *at gunpoint* to take the wrong toilet or go away, doesn't help

[12:41] <lizmat> Houston and Austin may be ok, fact is, they *are* part of TX

[12:41] <lizmat> and the gunpoint incident happened within commuting distance of Houston

[12:56] <tbrowder> ok, i understand, thnx for sharing…

[12:57] <tbrowder> there are lots of evil ppl in the world

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yes thanks for sharing stories and opinions. I got a job in Huston 10 years ago, and during the interview I asked the HR are we allowed to bring guns at work. She said until recently the rule of the company was "no guns at work", but they found out that is against the law in Texas; so when I asked the answer was "yes."

[13:07] *** linkable6 left

[13:10] <tbrowder> guns are not evil, ppl are

[13:11] <El_Che> yeah guns are made to spray love and cinnamon 

[13:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I was fine either way, BTW. 🙂

[13:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @El_Che LOL !!

[13:11] <lizmat> I agree that people can be evil, and I'd say very few of us are without any evil within us somewhere

[13:12] <ggoebel_> fwiw everything is political... IMHO, the best we can do is try to leave unrelated politics at the door

[13:12] <El_Che> I am an asshole, hence don't give me a gun

[13:12] <lizmat> making it easier to get a gun than to get a driver's license, feels wrong to me

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat I finally prepared a good enough version the document for Advent of Code I was promising. Here is a link: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/Articles/Introduction-to-Data-Wrangling-with-Raku.md .

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I am definitely not that nice to the unwashed masses in that writing.

[13:14] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: sorry, but it's too late for this year's advent

[13:14] <lizmat> the final post is already scheduled

[13:15] <lizmat> and I don't have much time atm to look at it now, but a quick glance tells me the article / blog post could well stand on its own without being part of the advent cycle :-)

[13:15] <ggoebel_> boxing day post? extra presents are nice

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat I understand and it is fine. 🙂

[13:15] <lizmat> ggoebel_: yeah, a bonus !

[13:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Yeah, that was my problem -- I could not make it smaller and lighthearted.

[13:16] <tbrowder> and it looks very interesting!

[13:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > guns are not evil, ppl are

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this sounds nice in theory, the problem is, the consequences of "being evil" matter

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you gave me a gun in my worst mood, I might just shoot someone

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> when otherwise I would be pretty harmless

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the problem with guns is that it makes causing the most possible harm look and feel harmless

[13:23] <tbrowder> lizmat, if you saw most us highways these days too many drivers obviously never intended to follow the rules anyway

[13:24] <lizmat> well, that's partly my point: it's already *very* easy to get a driver's license in the US, compared to e.g. NL where you generally have at least 40 hours of driving lessons

[13:24] *** TempIRCLogger left
[13:26] <lizmat> getting a gun is even easier in the US

[13:27] *** TempIRCLogger__ left
[13:27] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yeah, getting a drivers license in USA was definitely easier than in Europe. Also, USA is made to have car. (Only in very big cities like New York and Chicago you can live without one.)
