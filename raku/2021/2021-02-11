[07:06] <summerisle> interesting, thanks.

[07:21] <summerisle> next question is, i suppose, is there a way to get the command line to accept parameters as `-I <value>` as opposed to `-I=<value>` without implementing that functionality myself? i'm trying to implement a drop-in replacement for another command-line tool for reasons of laziness.

[07:22] <moritz> I'd not think you easily can; maybe take a look if there's a module for that?

[13:37] <AncientWizard> I've come here to share difficulties using Raku as a replacement for Perl5. I'm hoping to find others that have solved the problems I've found. I've used the Raku doc's but failed to find the golden nugget

[13:39] <Scimon> What is the problem you're having? (I've found Stack Overflow can be a good place for questions too, there's some good answers to a lot of stuff and you can give longer explantions).

[13:39] <andinus> lizmat: thanks

[13:39] <AncientWizard> I'm attempting to replace a workplace pel5 app with one written in Raku.

[13:40] <Scimon> Ok. But there must be specific issues you're coming across? 

[13:40] <AncientWizard> I have looked online but no matches.

[13:42] <El_Che> (completely next to the point, but I find it more productive to write new apps for a new itch instead of replacing older ones that work)

[13:43] <Scimon> You can't just drop a Perl5 app into Raku and expect it to work. If you're VERY VERY lucky (and it's very simple) it will but there is no direct compatibility.

[13:43] <AncientWizard> It has to do with symbol lookups.  If appears that the only successful lookups are for symbols i locally called in using 'use Mod::B;'

[13:44] *** jmerelo left
[13:44] <AncientWizard> No worries it a code rewrite

[13:44] <lizmat> AncientWizard: you might be interested in these remastered blog posts from 2018: https://github.com/Raku/CCR/blob/main/Remaster/Elizabeth%20Mattijsen/Migrating-to-Raku-Series.md

[13:44] <El_Che> and this oldie: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/day-10-introspecting-the-symbol-tables/

[13:45] <Scimon> Raku's scoping and exports are more rigorous than Perls in a lot of places. `use`ing a module won't import all the symbol table. 

[13:45] <lizmat> and it will only import them in the lexical scope of the 'use- statement

[13:45] <Scimon> You may want to look at https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#index-entry-sub_EXPORT and https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#is_export 

[13:45] <Scimon> That.

[13:45] <AncientWizard> If mod a calls in mod b then b can do a use on a and then b can't lookups on a

[13:46] <AncientWizard> B cant

[13:46] <Scimon> So you want to make a circular dependency? 

[13:46] <AncientWizard> No

[13:46] <Scimon> A uses B and B uses A? 

[13:47] <Scimon> Sorry just trying to understand.

[13:47] <AncientWizard> But b need to test if a is there and call a sub

[13:48] <Scimon> So you got mdule B and it's used A and you then want to call a sub in A? 

[13:48] <AncientWizard> If not there then do nothing. I wat to us a features if a is in memory

[13:48] <Scimon> Ahhh... So you want to *try* and load A? 

[13:49] <AncientWizard> No not load

[13:49] <El_Che> import

[13:49] <MasterDuke> https://modules.raku.org/dist/if:github:github:FROGGS maybe?

[13:49] <AncientWizard> Symbol check

[13:49] <AncientWizard> This is like p5 eval for a sub

[13:50] <Scimon> See this is the kind of deep make Perl stuff I try and avoid most of the time so have never really looked into doing it in Raku. 

[13:52] <AncientWizard> My p5 app is about 280k lines of source. Very cool

[13:52] <Scimon> Nice :)

[13:53] <AncientWizard> Let me add a story this

[13:53] <AncientWizard> In this case mod b is a console builder but it cat be sure what features are built in to app

[13:54] <AncientWizard> Can't be

[13:55] <AncientWizard> So it tests for N known features and only calls those those it can find to add their bits to the console

[13:57] *** dakkar left
[13:58] <Scimon> So... you want to know if a given module exists to be loaded? 

[13:58] <AncientWizard> I use this same technique when doing DB writes. If a data producer does not want to wait for a DB write it can check for the mod that will bulk up and background that work. I.E. delegates it so it can move on to the next work item

[14:01] <AncientWizard> App is Event driven and manages 90+ security scans in parallel

[14:03] <Scimon> m: my $exists = ::("A");say $exists.?exception

[14:03] <evalable6> Scimon, rakudo-moar 3235f3e42: OUTPUT: «No such symbol 'A'␤»

[14:04] <Scimon> So that looks to see if A is in the lexical scope. If not it returns a failure that I then look to see if it's got an exception method.

[14:04] <Scimon> https://docs.raku.org/language/packages#Interpolating_into_names Might help?

[14:04] <AncientWizard> If so :('Some::mod') ...

[14:05] <AncientWizard> Will always be false unless use Some::mod; is in the same file

[14:06] <Scimon> Yes. Because modules are lexically scoped not globally.

[14:07] <AncientWizard> Even if the use was already called in file a file read before this

[14:07] <Scimon> Yes because that use would be in that packages scope.

[14:07] <AncientWizard> But the symbol is an our class

[14:08] <AncientWizard> By default

[14:08] <Scimon> our defines a variable to be Package scoped. So it's not leaking out into Global scope. 

[14:10] <AncientWizard> Any chance I'm doing the lookup wrong

[14:13] <Scimon> lizmat++

[14:14] <Scimon> I think you might need to rethink how you're going about it AncientWizard.

[14:16] <AncientWizard> In case I confused things my mods are classes no actual units or module. class a::thing ...

[14:17] <Scimon> For me this feels like a perfect case for config files and runtime class loading with require. 

[14:20] <AncientWizard> Unfortunately its a long discussion about cutting dependencies and writing for test. It sometimes means more code but it has paid off

[14:21] <AncientWizard> I make every attempt to cut hard depends so testing can toss in adapters

[14:22] <Scimon> Hmmm. All I can think of is putting a more detailed example on Stack Overflow, there's a few of us there who may be able to help work out what to do.

[14:24] <AncientWizard> Agreed. Sadly I can't do that from work. Doing irc from phone is painful

[14:25] <Scimon> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66155502/best-way-to-check-optional-module-availability : Was this the question?

[14:26] <AncientWizard> I still believe I should be able to look up any global or our scoped symbol so long as use was performed at least ones before I look

[14:29] <AncientWizard> Sorry not the solution. The module is on disk but its not this code responsibly to load it. Its more like is this feature in memory then run it otherwise move on

[17:06] <guifa2> so I was thinking that the pack/unpack functions have been experimental and not given much love.  They're also very confusing

[17:06] <guifa2> confusing = I have to look at the docs everytime to regrok what stuff does

[17:06] <guifa2> maybe we should consider a totally different approach, eg

[17:07] <Scimon> I don't think the original Perl pack or unpack are the easiest to understand. 

[17:07] <guifa2> well, that's also true 

[17:08] <Scimon> (I'm not disagreeing with you just making the point ;) )

[17:09] <guifa2> my $bin = pack { pack $foo :int8; pack $bar :int16; pack $str :str for @str-array }

[17:09] <guifa2> or

[17:10] <guifa2> my $bin = pack { store-int8 $foo; store-int16 $bar; store-str $str for @str-array }

[17:10] *** dakkar left
[17:11] <codesections> would there be a way to take inspiration from JSON::Fast?

[17:13] <guifa2> codesections: that just uses to-json and from-json; packing has a few more options that can't be quite so succinctly summed up I don't think

[17:13] <guifa2> In effect, it doesn't really do anything you can't do with buf operations, it was just supposed to —in theory— make it easier

[17:14] <guifa2> the cool power could be in the unpack.  Currently unpack just returns a list, so you'd do

[17:14] <guifa2> my ($a, $b, $c) = unpack(…);

[17:14] <guifa2> Using a block, assignment could be enabled

[17:15] <guifa2> unpack { $a = unpack :int; $b = unpack :int; } or something

[17:16] <guifa2> I'd definitely need to think through it carefully to consider all the possibilities, but I think something oculd be done to make it actually useful

[17:18] *** vrurg left
[17:20] <Discipulus> some interesting update on * glob expansion on cmd.exe at https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=11128174

[17:20] <codesections> maybe something like `my $bin = pack({ :foo(int8), :bar(int16), :str(Str) }, @str-array)` (where the first arg is a Hash, not a block)?

[21:48] <guifa2> vrurg: re Raku conf.  I'm crazy (academic) talking here, but maybe in lieu of (or inaddition to) sponsorships we could shortly afterwards publish a quick proceeds of the conference for people who want to fork over $X to donate to TPF/TRF to support grants and run it through a print-on-demand service.  Keepsake + reference material

[21:51] *** johann1 joined
[21:52] <vrurg> guifa2: one thing I'm certain about: what you say is beyond my English abilities. :) I hardly understand your point.

[21:53] <guifa2> I ramble sometimes, feel free to yell at me for it :-)

[21:53] <guifa2> Instead of (or in addition to) trying to get sponsorships for money, perhaps we could give incentives for someone to be a paid "attendee".

[21:53] <vrurg> Me too. Sometimes thinking runs fast and talking/writing lags behind. The outcomes are usually messy. :)

[21:54] <guifa2> People have an interest in Raku books, etc, so perhaps we could publish proceedings of the conference (basically, a short book[let]) so people could have a reference copy of the presentations.  

[21:54] <guifa2> A nice keepsake, basically, but functional

[21:56] <johann1> Where would I have to look to find a precise definition of what "\s" matches? Thinking of a list of code points.

[21:56] <vrurg> I think the best is to have all possible options here. Having choice is always the best. Though I'm not sure a print on demand service could produce any substantial outcome.

[21:56] <vrurg> johann1: It should be on Regex documentation page. I think I saw it there.

[21:57] <johann1> I looked at https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#\s_and_\S but it does not give a definition just "a single whitespace character"

[21:58] *** Discipulus left
[21:59] <guifa2> johann1: it's anything that's defined in Unicode as a spacing character

[22:01] <guifa2> basically, it's equivalent to <:Z+[\r\n\t]>

[22:01] <guifa2> (because Unicode considers tab, CR and LF as control characters rather than spacing characters)

[22:02] <johann1> in other words everything marked as "White_Space" in this file https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt ?

[22:36] <codesections> guifa2: the thing is though, at an academic conference, most of the presentations are of papers, and then the proceeding include those papers.  But it seems like we mostly write presentations from scratch (rather than, say, adapting a blog post).  So what would go in the proceedings? 

[22:36] <guifa2> codesections: it depends on the conference

[22:36] <guifa2> the ones i go to, proceedings are written after the fact

[22:38] <codesections> oh, interesting.  But still by each speaker?

[22:39] <guifa2> Yeah.  My thinking was a lot of us could adapt our presentations to a written form within two or three weeks of giving it.  I could then stitch it together in InDesign, and have it off to the printers shortly thereafer.

[22:40] <guifa2> (in a lot of cases, it's copy paste stuff off of our slides, and add some connecting prose, really.  And if someone can't do theirs, I could probably speech-to-text them, and edit it togehter into something quick)

[22:41] <codesections> Hmm, I do like that idea, but my concern is that people might not volunteer to give a talk if they don't have time to write it up after (or just don't like writing).  Even if it's technically optional, I'd worry that it could scare people off.

[22:43] <codesections> Here's a related idea I've been toying around with suggesting: what if we published a "best of Raku essays" out of lizmat's blog-post remastering project?  Maybe with quick intros to each one providing context?

[22:44] <guifa2> ^^^I was literally just thinking another thing could be a "Best of Raku 2020", "Best of Raku 2021" and each year do that with some of the blogs, posts, presentations, etc

[22:44] <codesections> (When I was imagining proposing it, I was thinking that I'd volunteer to be the editor and write the connective bits, but it could be any of us/multiple people)

[22:44] <lizmat> codesections: those are definitely ideas that one could work with

[22:46] <codesections> Ok, well I think I'll write up a few thoughts slightly more formally and open an issue on the repo for the blog project

[23:20] <jdv79> is publicity a real issue?

[23:24] <jdv79> i used raku for one project professionally and like mr lembark it eats mem.  hard to advocate for a slowish lang that also eats mem:(
