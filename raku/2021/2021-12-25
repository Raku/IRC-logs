[01:12] <[Coke]> how do I stop getting notifications about raku-community-modules?

[01:12] <tellable6> 2021-12-24T19:38:56Z #raku <tbrowder> [Coke] i ran the tests and i think the pertinent ones passed. and the actual code example ran in the prog i built for it on my local host.

[01:13] <[Coke]> tbrowder: "the prog you built" - was the prog somehow different from the code in the snippet?

[01:14] <tbrowder> no, the same code.

[01:15] <[Coke]> ok. the last attempt I saw also failed so I reverted it as well.

[01:15] <[Coke]> if it passed for you, maybe we need a tie breaker. I am running 2021.10

[01:16] <tbrowder> there was no “xt” target,  but an “xtest” target.

[01:16] <[Coke]> yes. xt is the folder.

[01:17] <[Coke]> (stop getting notifications) well, leaving the org works. done

[01:17] <tbrowder> i don’t know how you are seeing the failure.p

[01:17] *** RandalSchwartz left
[01:18] <[Coke]> git checkout 49bf7a271; TEST_FILES=doc/Language/classtut.pod6 xt/examples-compilation.t

[01:18] <tbrowder> have you tried the example on yr local host? maybe it’s the mac problem

[01:18] <[Coke]> subtest 30 dies with Attribute $!counter not declared in class

[01:19] <[Coke]> and it's not. it's a my, not a has.

[01:19] <tbrowder> that passed for me, running linux debian 10 and rakudo 2021.10

[01:19] <[Coke]> Your code seems incorrect.

[01:20] <tbrowder> did you look at my pr?

[01:20] <[Coke]> m:      class Str-with-ID is Str { my $.counter = 0; has Str $.string; has Int $.ID; submethod TWEAK() { $!ID = ++$!counter; } }; say Str-with-ID.new(string => 'First').ID;  say Str-with-ID.new(string => 'Second').ID;

[01:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb16f7ecc: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Attribute $!counter not declared in class Str-with-ID␤at <tmp>:1␤------> method TWEAK() { $!ID = ++$!counter; } }⏏; say Str-with-ID.new(string => 'First')␤    expecting any of:␤        …»

[01:20] <[Coke]> ^^&

[01:21] <[Coke]> So, not just me.

[01:21] <tbrowder> look at my pr

[01:21] <[Coke]> I would verify when you run it standalone you're running the code you think you are, and that you don't have any local modifications to the file.

[01:21] <[Coke]> URL?

[01:21] <tbrowder> my  $counter;

[01:21] <[Coke]> I was looking at *what you committed*

[01:22] <tbrowder> look at my pr which i did not commit. it was done after your revert

[01:23] <[Coke]> *facepalm*

[01:23] <[Coke]> as I said - if the tests pass for you, go ahead and commit it.

[01:24] *** RandalSchwartz joined
[01:25] *** RandalSchwartz left
[01:26] <tbrowder> ok, but i haven’t looked at the pr since i submitted it. won’t it show a good test if it passes the xt tests?

[01:26] <[Coke]> No. the xt tests are "extra" they are not run as part of the normal process.

[01:26] <[Coke]> apparently I am the only person that runs them.

[01:27] <[Coke]> I hope that folks with direct commit bits or large PRs will run the tests as part of their normal workflow.

[01:27] <[Coke]> the checks run on PRs get you 'make test', basically.

[01:29] <tbrowder> ok, i’m confident it works, but i would feel better if you could inspect  my code changes in the pr first. note also the important changes in the adjacent text.

[01:31] <tbrowder> as an aside, the classtut file seems to me to be a bit disorganized after these 4+ yrs of updates.

[01:33] <tbrowder> i accept the lashes for not running the xt tests when i should, but i will try to remember to do that

[01:33] *** lichtkind left
[01:35] <[Coke]> if you ran the compilation test, You're set. I'm not doing it again.

[01:36] <tbrowder> ok
