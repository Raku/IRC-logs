[12:22] <tbrowder> lizmat: hi. i was going to ask a question but i did find the answer in the docs.

[12:22] <lizmat> docs++

[12:22] <lizmat> people working on the docs++  rather  :-)

[12:22] <tbrowder> i'm in process of porting more old code to raku and need to test then

[12:23] <tbrowder> *them algorithmically

[12:24] <tbrowder> maybe back later...bye

[22:29] <codesections> Any thoughts between Text::CSV and CSV::Parser?

[22:29] <codesections> (Or any other Raku CSV parsers, for that matter – but those seem like the main two)

[22:31] <codesections> I vaguely recall that one CSV parser in Raku passes up on some optimizations so that it can be a stable Rakudo performance benchmark.  Is that one of these?  Or did I make that up?

[22:38] <moon-child> <lizmat> [Coke] I could optimize Text::CSV significantly, by using nqp, but agreed with [Tux] only "standard" language should be used

[22:39] <moon-child> (not as a performance metric, but for portability)

[22:39] <codesections> Aha.  Thanks moon-child.  So it looks like we don't have a fully optimized CSV parser, but that not really even a problem for my usecase so **shrug**

[22:40] <codesections> Also, unless it's just me, modules.raku.org seems to be down (though raku.land is a fine alternative) 

[22:41] <moon-child> tbh I'm somewhat sceptical of portability losses from using nqp.  There aren't any major non-rakudo implementations; and if such appear in the future, it should not be hard to make a portability shim

[22:41] <moon-child> re modules.raku.org, see #raku-dev.  Dns/cloudflare stuff

[22:42] <codesections> I *think* that it was partly for performance measurement reasons: IIRC, we use that as a Rakudo benchmark and want to track how fast Raku (rather than nqp) has gotten

[22:45] <codesections> oh, I found what I was remembering – in a r/rakulang thread I started myself.  Oops. https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/m15nlr/7_years_of_raku_performance_improvements_and/

[22:45] <japhb> moon-child: The nqp:: ops have no language stability guarantees; nqp:: ops can (and do) get removed when no longer needed by Rakudo itself.

[22:46] <moon-child> codesections: ah, right on

[22:46] <japhb> That said, JSON::Fast and CBOR::Simple both use nqp ops because the performance need is strong

[22:46] <moon-child> japhb: right

[22:48] <codesections> japhb: is the thought that Text::CSV doesn't need the same treatment because CSV files tend to be less performance critical?  Or we just haven't gotten around to an CSV::Fast equivalent to JSON::Fast?

[22:48] <japhb> But I'd be in favor of someone doing a CSV::Fast; being able to handle more data formats at decent speed is a good thing.  And localizing most of the nqp:: use in the few modules that really need may cut down on indiscriminate use in the ecosystem in general.

[22:48] <japhb> codesections: ^^

[22:49] <japhb> .oO( Speed::At::Any::Cost::* )

[23:12] *** lichtkind left
[23:25] *** linkable6 joined
[23:32] <tonyo_> CSV::Parser was written to be configurable and handle any kind of data you want, including binary csvs.  That said, it's slow as hell

[23:32] <tonyo_> japhb: libcsv bindings exist in Text::CSV::LibCSV

[23:42] <rba> Still most of the sites are down. Sorry. http://stats.raku.org

[23:43] <japhb> tonyo_: Is that sufficiently fast and correct that we can recommend that to people as their default?

[23:45] <tonyo_> japhb: which?

[23:45] <tonyo_> libcsv is usually considered fast enough

[23:46] <japhb> Text::CSV::LibCSV (not just libcsv, I'm also including the completeness/speed of the binding)
