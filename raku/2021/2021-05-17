[17:32] <Doc_Holliwood> i don't know

[17:33] <Doc_Holliwood> guess i will stick with a ternary then

[17:33] <codesect`> hmm?  I thought ^^^^ was what you wanted?

[17:34] <jmerelo> Actually, not very clear to me what's the use case here.

[17:34] <jmerelo> Shouldn't it avoid raising an exception? If it raises an exception if it does not exist, then what's the different WRT just calling it directly?

[17:35] <jmerelo> Ah, OK. You need to check against Nil https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-methodop_.%3F

[17:35] *** wamba1 left
[17:36] <jmerelo> m: my $x; say $x.?sum // "Nope"

[17:38] <codesect`> yeah, the version I showed with the parens works there

[17:38] <codesect`> m: my $x; say (try $x.sum) // 0 

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[17:38] <jmerelo> Doc_Holliwood: right. But the thing above should work, right? It's checking for definedness

[17:39] <jmerelo> Hum

[17:39] <Doc_Holliwood> yes, but it's obscure and introduces another set of braces

[17:39] <jmerelo> I think that the problem is that $x is not defined.

[17:39] <Doc_Holliwood> i hate braces =)

[17:40] <jmerelo> m: my $x = "Can't"; say $x.?sum() // "Nope"

[17:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «Cannot convert string to number: base-10 number must begin with valid digits or '.' in '3⏏5Can't' (indicated by ⏏)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:42] <jmerelo> I think it does not work very well on a multi

[17:43] <jmerelo> m: my $x = :3foo; say $x.?foo() // "Nope"

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «Nope␤»

[17:43] <codesect`> how about:

[17:43] <Doc_Holliwood> m: my $x; say (.item with $x.?x) || 0

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[17:44] <codesect`> m: my $x; say $x.?&sum//0

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller sum(Any:U: ); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:D: *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:44] <jmerelo> m: my $x; say (.item with $x.?sum) || 0

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller sum(Any:U: ); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:D: *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:44] <codesect`> m: my $x; say $x.&sum//0

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller sum(Any:U: ); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:D: *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:44] <jmerelo> codesect`: tried that above. It's the multi

[17:45] <jmerelo> It says it will call "if there's a method of such name". But then, it might fail because of the signature

[17:45] <codesect`> Yeah, I thought the & might change that

[17:46] <codesect`> m: my $x; my sub sum(|) {}; say $x.?&sum//0

[17:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[17:46] *** DiffieHellman left
[17:46] <codesect`> that's slightly hacky, but works without any parens 

[17:47] <jmerelo> m: my $x=3; my sub sum(|) {}; say $x.?&sum//0

[17:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e933613c: OUTPUT: «0␤»
