[14:46] <keutoi> How do I load a raku source file from repl? I know of `require`, is there any thing else that does loading?

[14:46] <lizmat> use  ?

[14:47] <ugexe> maybe you want https://docs.raku.org/routine/EVALFILE

[14:48] <keutoi> EVALFILE is what I was looking for. use and require seem to deal in modules. When I require "file", the file gets evaluated but the symbols are not accessable within repl.

[14:50] <gfldex> keutoi: this might provide inspiration: https://gfldex.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/internal-indirection/

[15:03] <keutoi> gfldex: after IO.slurp.EVAL shouldn't we have access to sub MAIN by the symbol MAIN? why deal with a reference to it?

[15:04] <gfldex> because the script that runs the eval got a MAIN already

[15:04] <keutoi> Hmm so a namespace problem.

[15:05] <keutoi> gfldex: thanks for that write up. got a look at some internals.
