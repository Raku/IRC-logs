[16:01] <RaycatWhoDat> In any case, hello. I'm sure I've asked here before but who here is familiar with TXR? http://nongnu.org/txr

[16:03] <RaycatWhoDat> Every time I look at it, it fits my needs regarding workflow but it's not very pleasant to write.

[16:10] <RaycatWhoDat> I ask here because I'm not really using Raku to its fullest so one of three things needs to happen for me

[16:12] <RaycatWhoDat> 1) Figure out other use cases for Raku that I might encounter. 2) Replace Raku with a tool that makes sense for me. 3) Drop Raku entirely (which I don't really wanna do because I really like the language).

[16:45] <RaycatWhoDat> It is useful!

[16:47] <RaycatWhoDat> I just don't use enough of its features, I suppose.

[16:47] <RaycatWhoDat> Makes me wonder if I don't need to use a whole other language to achieve my goals.

[16:48] <RaycatWhoDat> (Usually simple text processing.)

[16:48] <perry> I know right? That's why I still use COBOL.

[16:48] <perry> (But yes, I often feel similarly with regard to Raku.)

[16:49] <perry> (But that might be because I don't have enough experience or time to learn it effectively.)

[16:50] <perry> I think the most successful thing I did with it was write a script that gave a solution to a NYTimes puzzle that got a reply from the Associate Puzzles Editor of the NYTimes.

[17:14] <PimDaniel> Hi.

[17:15] <PimDaniel> Does anybody knows if we can make a kind of C union-like in Raku. I need of 3 int8_t. 

[17:16] <tadzik> if you need 3 of the same type, wy do you need a union?

[17:18] <PimDaniel> tadzik: I'll make a kindof 24 bits type which i can use whole or part. 

[17:18] *** epony left
[17:21] <tadzik> then you want a struct, not a union, I think

[17:22] <tadzik> what is the problem you're trying to solve?

[17:24] <PimDaniel> According to https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall.html#CUnions, i can may be  make it with NativeCall but i'll be carefull.

[17:26] *** epony joined
[17:26] <PimDaniel> I's difficult to explain what i'm trying to do for now.

[17:27] <cog__> When doing $file.IO.parent on windows, is it idempotent on the root of a partition ?

[17:27] *** PimDaniel left
[17:31] *** Scimon left
[17:34] <[Coke]> If it's not something being passed to nativecall, I'm not sure mimicing a C union is necessarily helpful in Raku.

[18:50] <RaycatWhoDat> QQ: If I wanted to implement a new addition to the standard routines Raku provides out of the box, is there any benefit to implement it in NQP over just making an external module?

[18:51] <lizmat> I think the consensus is that it is better to do it in Raku as an external module

[18:51] <lizmat> once proven useful enough for inclusion in core, it can be nqp-ified if needed

[20:34] <El_Che> Hi AlexDaniel` 

[20:34] <AlexDaniel`> hello

[20:34] <tbrowder> FYI, I'm near to publishing a major update to my PDF::Document module and wonder if anyone would like to give it a try. its current use is as a test bed for lifting most PDF::Lite up to a single Doc class with easy-to- use wrapper methods for creating PDF documents. As such it now functions very similar to the old Display PostScript or maybe WordPerfect or ed.

[20:36] <tbrowder> it currently has simple graphics (circle, ellipse, rectangle, polyline, polygon, and line).

[20:37] <tbrowder> there is an example program with it that demos all the working parts and it can be easily modified for custom output.

[20:38] <tbrowder> it has all 14 PostScript core fonts available, with para fill, underlining, kerning, and strikethrough.

[20:41] <tbrowder> eventually it will be used with other PDF modules to enable pod to PDF for a fairly sophisticated pod-to-pdf word processor.

[20:46] <sortiz> tbrowder, looks great.

[20:47] *** aborazmeh left
[20:48] <tbrowder> well i hope it's useful, it will be for me for sure. web stuff is great, but i still like real paper!

[20:51] <sortiz> Just a suggestion:  In your example, it would seem more idiomatic to use 'with' instead of 'given'.

[20:57] <sortiz> If I see a 'given' I expect one or more 'when'.

[22:29] <tbrowder> but you do need some basic knowledge of typesetting, page layout terms, fonts, etc. i do not have a good tutorial to recommend at the moment.

[22:37] <sortiz> cog: 'lib' is a pragma, so only valid with 'use'. On the other side "require lib 'lib'" creates, at compile time, a package 'lib' and expect to import the symbol 'lib' from the 'lib' module. But you can't redeclare a symbol in the same scope.
