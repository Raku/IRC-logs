[14:33] <leont> What's wrong with modules.raku.org's search? searching for "path finder" doesn't list my module Path::Finder. That seems rather suboptimal.

[14:36] <jraspass> https://raku.land?q=path+finder works ;-)

[14:40] <rba>  leont: modules is updated hourly 

[14:40] <leont> rba: I didn't just release it

[14:41] <leont> The module has existed for over two years, most recent release was in December

[14:42] <jraspass> yeah looks like you need colons on mro

[14:42] <rba> Hmm. Will look into it when Iâ€˜m back at my desk

[14:43] <jraspass> what's the backend? solr?

[15:01] <bazzaar> Hi Raku

[15:05] <bazzaar> I just installed Rakudo v2021.02.1. using the Cloudshare pre-built package for OpenSuse Leap 15.2, been problematic due to many Warning messages about not being able to create Short directories

[15:08] <bazzaar> thought it was a zef issue, but now discovered that it's more a rakudo bug, and as a fix I just created the /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/vendor/short and /opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/short myself

[15:33] <tellable6> El_Che, I'll pass your message to bazzaar

[15:33] <El_Che> ah gone

[15:36] <El_Che> lizmat: raising the bug to rakudo is a good idea. Many people will confuse the warning with an error
