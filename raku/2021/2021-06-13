[14:08] <antononcube> Hi! I want to define left and right "word" boundary assertions that for which "word" consist of alpha-numeric characters _and_ punctuation characters. E.g. I want to have word boundaries for words like ".net" or "c++" and parse a list of such words. I want to parse a list of 

[14:08] <antononcube> This left boundary definition seems to work together with >> : regex wbpl { <!after [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> <?before [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> }

[14:08] <antononcube> The parsing stops working when I try to use this right boundary defintion: regex wbpr { <?after [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> <!before [ <alnum> | <punct> ]> }

[14:08] <antononcube> Any suggestions?

[14:09] <moritz> antononcube: what's an example of where you want it to match and where it doesn't match?

[14:10] <antononcube> '.net framework, c++, java, and software architect'

[14:11] <antononcube> @moritz Thank you for replying! Please, take a look in these definitions: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-DSL-Entity-Jobs/blob/main/lib/DSL/Entity/Jobs/Grammar/EntityNames.rakumod 

[14:13] <moritz> antononcube: http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/60c61269.6e90.d6 your word boundary regex seems to work for me

[14:14] <moritz> http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/60c612d3.6e90.3b3 this one illustrates all the position where it matches

[14:15] <antononcube> @moritz Ok, good to know!

[14:29] <antononcube> @moritz Thank you! You comment really helped -- I found a mistake in another part of my program...

[14:34] <antononcube> I have another question -- it is about using Raku in Babel org mode. (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)

[14:35] <antononcube> Does someone here use Babel org-mode and Raku? I read somewhere that Raku is supposed to supported in Babel, but I do not think it is.

[14:39] <antononcube> I found this emacs-Lisp  definition: https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-03/msg00636.html . And with some little tweaking I made it work in Aquamacs. It looks like though the author, Tim Van den Langenbergh, has abandoned any efforts in that direction and deleted / removed the corresponding files from hist GitHub repository.

[19:27] <Xliff> Hello!

[19:27] <Xliff> I am now getting this error: 

[19:27] <Xliff> Cannot modify an immutable Block (-> |c { #`(Block|948...)

[19:27] <Xliff> at /home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GIO/lib/GIO/Roles/AppInfo.pm6 (GIO::Roles::AppInfo):429

[19:29] <Xliff> That error points here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GIO/blob/master/lib/GIO/Roles/AppInfo.pm6#L429

[19:29] <Xliff> This is a regression from last week's Raku.

[19:30] <Xliff> This error was not reported in g0de28ae72.

[19:31] <Xliff> Can someone take a quick load at that code and see if they can find an eror. Note I have used this code in previous raku, no proble.

[19:35] *** RandalSchwartz left
[19:43] <Xliff> This error appears again, here:

[20:05] <lizmat> could you golf this to something bisectable, or do you know the offending commit already?

[20:06] <lizmat> ah, I should drop the g  :-)

[20:06] <lizmat> Xliff: can you provide a full stack trace ?

[20:07] <Xliff> lizmat: This is over 500,000 lines of code. Where do you golf?

[20:07] <Xliff> Am attempting to find the commit, but that is time-consuming and might not finish, today.

[20:07] <Xliff> Full stack trace incoming

[20:08] <lizmat> ah, you're saying that 0de28ae72 is not it 

[20:08] <lizmat> ?

[20:08] *** linkable6 left
[20:08] <Xliff> No. Checked that one and it produced the same error.

[20:08] <Xliff> It's within the last 3 weeks. Thought last week had a no error week.

[20:09] <Xliff> I'll have to check the stat files.

[20:09] <Xliff> I might need to install bot code to get this one.

[20:10] <lizmat> ++Xliff

[20:11] *** linkable6 joined
[20:12] <raydiak> generally you would golf it by making a copy of the project, then rippinng out giant chunks one at a time, checking if the failure still exists after each one. repeat until the only thing left is the failing code, then reduce that to the shortest possible thing you can write which still triggers the bug

[20:15] <Xliff> radiak: Yep. I get the gist of that, but what happens when you are 3 projects into a dependency chain?

[20:16] <raydiak> start by removing the dependencies. if you're lucky, the bug will still exist without them

[20:17] <Xliff> Can't remove the dependencies and expect the code to compile! 

[20:17] <raydiak> remove the part that won't compile without them

[20:17] <Xliff> Unfortunately that is most of the code

[20:18] <Xliff> So I have to show examples from the code. Golfing doesn't work with what I have.

[20:18] <Xliff> Especially this part. It's more types than anything else.

[20:18] <Xliff> If you use a type from a previous dependency (which is all over the code.... see GObject) 

[20:18] <raydiak> remove the type constraints

[20:18] <Xliff> You have to include the dependencies

[20:18] <Xliff> Humm.... I'll think about that.

[20:19] <lizmat> Xliff: full stack trace ?

[20:19] <Xliff> But what if the dependencies are a part of the issue?

[20:19] <Xliff> lizmat: Still working on dependency installs.

[20:19] <raydiak> then you at least know that, which is a start

[20:19] <lizmat> ok, whenever you have one  :-)

[20:20] <raydiak> then you start ripping apart the dependencies too

[20:20] <lizmat> raydiak: I think Xliff gets the concept of golfing :-)

[20:21] <raydiak> he asked. I answered.

[20:21] <Xliff> radiak: At that point, it's probably just easier for someone to download the code and look at it.

[20:22] <raydiak> I looked. didn't see anything obvious. if it's 500,000 lines and the error is elsewhere, that's going to be a tall order

[20:23] <raydiak> anyway, apparently I'm not being helpful. going to move on with my morning. good luck, I hope someone can help you

[20:23] <Xliff> Now you feel my pain.

[20:23] <Xliff> Fortunately at the GIO level it's not over 100k

[20:27] <Xliff> lizmat: stack trace generated. Creating a gist.

[20:28] <Xliff> lizmat: https://gist.github.com/Xliff/b9067702a014a9beee2a9f98ee8f3f79

[20:31] <lizmat> Ah, looks like Method::Also is involved

[20:33] <lizmat> does it happen at compile time ?

[20:34] <Xliff> Looks like it.

[20:34] <Xliff> And o crap. I think I know why. I made recent changes.

[20:34] <Xliff> Will the use of "but" modify a block?

[20:35] <Xliff> If that is true, then I will need to wrap the block in a sub. *sigh*

[20:36] <lizmat> yup  :-(

[20:37] <Xliff> Maybe this: 

[20:37] <Xliff> my \me = -> |c { o."{ $p.value.name }"( |c.list.skip(1), |c.hash ) };

[20:37] <Xliff>               me = me but Method::Also::AliasedMethod;

[20:37] <Xliff> So could that be wrapped in a sub?

[20:38] <Xliff> m: role Subby { }; my $a = sub { say "Hi!" } but Subby; $a.^name.say

[20:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 750c5d04a: OUTPUT: «Sub+{Subby}␤»

[20:38] <Xliff> Cool!

[20:38] <vrurg> Xliff: the error rather points at an attempt to assign to a non-Scalar.

[20:38] <Xliff> vrurg: Then wouldn't \me count?

[20:39] <vrurg> Xliff: sure it will.

[20:39] <vrurg> \me becomes a binding to a Block.

[20:39] <vrurg> You don't need a sub, perhaps. Just use $me =

[20:40] <Xliff> Hah! OK. Then changing it to $me should fix it. Checking.

[20:41] <vrurg> As a matter of fact, you can still use \me, but then `me := me but ...`

[20:42] <vrurg> Ah, pardon me, `me := ` won't work. :( Though I always expect it to be ok.

[20:43] <vrurg> m: my $r := { say "foo" }; role R { }; $r := $r but R

[20:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 750c5d04a: ( no output )

[20:43] <vrurg> Anyway, the above is faster and more memory-efficient.

[20:47] <Xliff> vrurg: What about "my $me := -> |c { o."{ $p.value.name }"( |c.list.skip(1), |c.hash ) } but Method::Also::AliasedMethod;"

[20:48] <vrurg> Xliff: Then just `\me = ` will do too, if you prefer this form.

[20:48] <Xliff> I attempted that version of \me and it still generated the error.

[20:49] <vrurg> Xliff: I'd say an attempt to assign into `me` is lurking somewhere.

[20:49] <moritz>  m: my $r := { say "foo" }; role R { }; $r does R; say $r

[20:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 750c5d04a: OUTPUT: «-> ;; $_? is raw = OUTER::<$_> { #`(Block+{R}|79142800) ... }␤»

[20:50] <vrurg> m: role R { }; my \me = -> |c { } but R;

[20:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 750c5d04a: ( no output )

[20:50] <vrurg> m: role R { }; my \me = -> |c { } but R; say me

[20:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 750c5d04a: OUTPUT: «-> |c { #`(Block+{R}|87593896) ... }␤»

[20:53] <Xliff> cd

[20:53] <Xliff> LOL!

[20:54] <raydiak> Xliff last note before I'm afk: I hope you understand I'm never trying to be counterprodocutive. I've golfed bugs out of codebases twice as large. it does take some time and thought, but it does work if you do it right. I only wanted to point out that a tool you already have in your belt can work even here. I hope you don't feel like I'm picking on you. that is never my intention

[20:56] <Xliff> raydiak: I understand that. Thanks for your input. It's just when I come to my p6-GLib projects, golfing is not an easy or quick way to reach a problem. --ll-exception is almost faster.
