[11:16] <pmurias> hi, do we have an irc log for the new libera channel?

[11:19] <bartolin> colabti logs the libera channels since a couple of days ago. See .e.g https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku-dev?date=2021-05-26#l73 (AlexDaniel++)

[11:20] <bartolin> also lizmat set something up, but I didn't came around to take a look. The link should be somewhere in the backlog from the last two or three days.

[11:20] <lizmat> logs.liz.nl

[11:20] <bartolin> lizmat++ ;)

[11:21] <lizmat> note: that's just an alpha version, but it should have all the logs except the ones for today

[11:21] <lizmat> still testing whether additions during the day percolate correctly into the search functionality

[19:06] <Shaeto> how Raku pass @list to sub/method arguments ? by value ? i know how to get reference in p5 but think i don't need it in p6 ? what if i use @list multiple times in subcalls will Raku spend time for cloning ?

[20:12] <Shaeto> @a = Array.new, ....

[20:13] <Shaeto> for $x ->$y ... can be compiled but does not iterate $x, so, answer is for $x.Array -> $y

[23:39] <holly> My squeak compiler system I made today : http://github.com/zarathemage/zephyr-smalltalk does not compile yet though

[23:40] <[Coke]> OOC, why the Apple license?

[23:41] <[Coke]> Seriously just curious. Haven't seen that one before.

[23:42] <holly> just for fun, apple open source

[23:42] <holly> a bit of compiler theory

[23:43] <holly> also for racul etc.

[23:43] <holly> something to test out smalltalk ideas

[23:44] <holly> smalltalk <-> apple more or less

[23:46] <moon-child> how's that?

[23:46] <moon-child> I thought it was just objc <- smalltalk ripoff, but that was it

[23:46] <holly> since 1978

[23:47] <holly> what you say about objc is also true

[23:48] <holly> the meaning is to put in behaviours for widget trees of decorated OO things

[23:48] <holly> just as in AI

[23:48] <holly> it's open

[23:51] <holly> the image file contains the behaviours

[23:51] <holly> so less shifting

[23:52] <holly> it's just an id now, but I want to use it in the image FS

[23:53] <holly> I'm going to write a prolog for it

[23:55] <holly> for the image FS system

[23:55] <holly> tree, widget tree

[23:58] <holly> I mean FS tree, widget tree
