[10:33] <PimDaniel> Hi \o

[10:34] *** mowotter left
[10:35] <PimDaniel> I'm searching a simple solution to call a native method print/say/printf/sprintf by invoquing his name into a variable. This will be controlled of course for security reasons.

[10:36] <PimDaniel> or may be by his address?

[12:39] <PimDaniel> In Perl5, import where complicated and often bought to confusion.

[12:40] <PimDaniel> I see it is worse in Raku. :(

[12:40] <lizmat> PimDaniel: how so ?

[12:40] <El_Che> ?

[12:41] <El_Che> in most of the cases, use variables for method/function names is very handle, but very risky (a runtime crash waiting to happen)

[12:42] <PimDaniel> How can i make a simple custom 'included' group of subs just to separate them into another file? without to need to write stupid 'is export' on each sub or any constant , etc?

[12:42] <El_Che> but I don't see how it's different in raku compared to perl

[12:43] <PimDaniel> It not simpler : indeed. I thought it was : but no.

[12:45] <PimDaniel> The import machanism is REALLY a big masturbation : i think at the point thez kept it in Raku.

[12:48] <lizmat> sub exporter(*@_) { Map.new( @_.map: { .name => $_ } ) }

[12:51] *** PimDaniel joined
[12:57] <PimDaniel> lizmat: thank's but which of the 2 answers you made must i use? Both or one of them?

[12:57] *** Black_Ribbon left
[12:58] <lizmat> the first is a helper sub to allow you to create the Map to be returned by EXPORT

[12:58] <lizmat> the &foo, &bar represent the subs you want to export

[12:58] <PimDaniel> ok i understand now, thanks!

[12:58] <lizmat> EXPORT takes positional args, so you can make the set dependent on that

[12:58] <lizmat> use Module <foo>  should appear as "foo" in EXPORT

[12:59] <PimDaniel> true!

[13:00] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[13:00] <PimDaniel> Ok see you later.

[13:01] <PimDaniel> Sorry for my hungryness but @/!8@รง#!!,  merde hein quoi!
