[11:35] <lizmat> .oO( don't let lightning strike! )
[11:35] <gfldex> Discrod bridge test.
[11:36] <gfldex> :-/ still ends up in the wrong Discord server.
[11:36] <lizmat> meh

[11:40] <gfldex> OK, It helps to kill the right process. What a relief!
[11:41] <gfldex> You lot need to be civil now, the young folk over on Discord can hear what you say!
[11:42] <lizmat> welcome Discord folks!

[11:45] <Altreus> So we still haven't entirely resolved the issue where the heartbeat stops but there is no disconnection
[11:45] <Altreus> jnthn helped us out and we thought it was gone
[11:45] <Altreus> But there appears to be some sort of edge case where, eventually, it just stops receiving events
[11:45] <Altreus> more bots = more data
[11:45] <Altreus> maybe we'll figure it out
[11:47] <gfldex> I have a PR up to start cleaning up debugging. I would like to have a build in web server to be able to dig around in data structures at runtime.
[11:51] <Altreus> kane showed me a PR last night but I'd already given up and gone to bed
[11:51] <Altreus> I'm hoping to have the time and energy to actually do my stream tonight and I might as well start with that
[11:52] <kawaii_> someone said my name
[11:53] <Altreus> na
[11:53] <Altreus> nobody here

[11:54] *** ufobat joined
[11:57] <kawaii_> gfldex: your PR goes a long way to helping us clean up the log output which has been on our list of things for a while now, but the number of things you chose to hide from the output is a little heavy handed imo, such as hiding when disconnects and reconnects happen - which seems like something a bot developer would want a record of without having debug logging active
[11:58] <kawaii_> for sure though the heartbeats themselves should be hidden away :)
[11:59] <Altreus> yeah those things are still on because see above, but having a simple switch to turn it off seems good
[12:01] <kawaii_> an internal webserver when debug mode is on sounds handy though
[12:01] <kawaii_> but we shouldn't clutter this channel with discussion about our module :P
[12:02] *** reportable6 left

[12:07] <gfldex> It's very easy to switch them on. Once you do you can .wrap the two functions and do some filtering.
[12:13] <Altreus> jnthn suggested using Log::Timeline but I've not managed to construct sufficient understanding

[22:35] <tbrowder> weird stuff, but Raku can do anything!!!
[22:35] <moon-child> anything can do anything!  Welcome to turing equivalence :)
[22:37] <raydiak> for some value of "anything". I like the Raku version of that a lot more than, say, Brainfuck...
[22:38] <moon-child> watch for my raku implementation written in brainfuck
