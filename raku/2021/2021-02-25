[02:36] <perry> Gibberish orrrrr?

[02:36] <perry> I just realized I had +R set when I didn't want it, whoops.

[02:37] <perry> Well, if you do /mode <yournick> +R you won't get any PMs from unregistered people.

[02:54] <guifa2> codesections++

[02:55] <codesections> sorry it took so long :D

[02:57] <guifa2> Haha 'sok.  I've been busy reformating CLDR again again (although this time more just tinier touchups)

[02:57] <guifa2> haha

[02:58] <codesections> ha.  Somehow I feel like that's an all-purpose reply for you, no matter when :)

[02:59] <guifa2> I mean … yes :-)

[02:59] <guifa2> But no lie, a project of this scope has meant I've learned a *lot*

[03:00] <codesections> I bet!

[03:01] <guifa2> that's where the idea of the FOSDEM presentation came out of — I'm writing a module that I have to use to write other moduels that I need to write the one that started this whole danged journey … so I'm constantly thinking how to improve the links between them

[03:02] <codesections> also, part of the strength of Raku's concision is that it makes it a lot easier to rewrite code (in the spirit of https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/how-to-write-disposable-code-in-large-systems or similar)

[03:03] <guifa2> I've been really enjoying using traits lately.  I was able to cut out about a hundred lines of code by rewriting them as traits on attributes

[03:04] <codesections> O.O  I need to do more with traits

[03:04] <guifa2> I had a lazy loader

[03:05] <guifa2> has $!foo; method foo { .return with $!foo; …………………… $!foo = finish-loading-for(FOO_OFFSET) } 

[03:05] <guifa2> it's a pattern I've used before and it works nicely if you just have one or two methods like that, but by the time I got to the 12 attribute … 

[03:05] <guifa2> has $!foo is lazy; # done

[03:06] <codesections> nice :)

[03:17] <leont> The recent haskellish code question reminded me I had some almost finished code doing just that 

[03:17] <leont> So now it works, and all that's between me releasing an Erlang style actor model module is writing documentation…

[03:19] <guifa2> leont: did you see gfldex's blog post on it?

[03:20] <leont> Yeah

[03:21] <xinming> perry: Thanks

[03:21] <guifa2> when I saw it I was like "this is exactly what I was talking about at FOSDEM" haha

[03:21] <leont> The whole «Hold (:$key) {}» trick was new to me.

[03:22] <leont> As in, named destructuring like that was a bit surprising, but quite useful

[08:05] <codesections> .ask guifa very cool.  One thing I haven't gotten my head around, though, with traits is when to use a new variant of `is` vs a new trait altogether.  E.g., could you have replaced `multi sub trait_mod:<is> (Attribute \attr, :$lazy)` with `multi sub trait_mod:<lazy> (Attribute \attr)`?  Or would that not work?  If it does work, is there a reason to prefer one to the other?  (Other than choosing between calling it with `is lazy` vs

[08:05] <codesections> `lazy`, I mean)i

[08:05] <tellable6> codesections, I'll pass your message to guifa2

[10:08] <codesections> gfldex++ “Raku is a highly composable programming language, where things just fall into place” sounds a lot like the theme from guifa's Surprisingly Unsurprising talk at Fosdem: so many things fit perfectly together, not b/c anyone planed for that _in particular_ but because the underlying primitives are so carefully planed.  It's great :D

[10:08] *** mad_hatter joined
[10:09] <gfldex> codesections: planned as in "iterated for 10 years until all the edge-cases have worn off"?

[10:10] <codesections> haha, yeah, that :)

[10:12] <codesections> I guess it's easy for me to show up post the "Raku" rename, and view the language as a magnificent jewel of design... skipping over the 10+ years of hard work iterating on that design!

[10:14] <codesections> (On the other hand, a _lot_ of Raku's great ideas were already present in the Synopses, so :shrug: )

[10:21] *** ensamvarg left
[10:32] <codesections> I'm clearly forgetting something basic.  How do I dwim here: 

[10:32] <codesections> m: my &f = &g // { 'default' }

[10:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    g used at line 1␤␤»

[10:37] <gfldex> m: my &f = MY::<&g> // { 'default' }; f;

[10:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: ( no output )

[10:37] <gfldex> m: my &f = MY::<&g> // { say 'default' }; f;

[10:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «default␤»

[10:37] <gfldex> m: sub g { say 'oi‽' }; my &f = MY::<&g> // { say 'default' }; f;

[10:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 726a75e24: OUTPUT: «oi‽␤»

[10:38] <gfldex> codesections: ^^^

[10:38] <codesections> oh, thanks.  That was... not as basic as I was thinking I was missing!

[10:38] <codesections> ty

[10:39] <codesections> I guess &MY::g also works, and helps the line-noise factor a bit :)

[10:39] <gfldex> it wasn't basic because a bare `g` is a compile time thing and calling `//` happens at runtime. I believe Rakus partly runtime partly compiletime nature makes it hard on beginners.

[10:40] <codesections> yeah.  I've *mostly* crossed that hurdle, though I clearly still get tripped up a bit

[10:41] <codesections> it's when we start nesting compiletimes and runtimes, that I'm in serious danger!

[10:43] <sxmx> m: for 1..10 { put $_ ** 3 }

[12:25] <codesections> here's a question that has me stumped, even though it seems like it should have an easy answer: 

[12:26] <codesections> the docs provide this example for an async socket: whenever $conn.Supply.lines -> $line { #`(block) }

[12:26] <codesections> how do I do the same thing, but for $n bytes at a time (instead of one line at a time)

[12:27] <codesections> with a regular socket, I'd use .read

[12:28] <codesections> but that isn't available here.  My first thought was to use .head($n), but that seems to give the first $n packets (or Blobs?), not the first $n bytes

[14:27] <Altreus> do you have to create $conn in a special way so it knows to deliver bytes?

[14:29] <codesections> yeah, I've actually done that -- you do $conn.Supply(:bin)

[14:30] <codesections> (I went a different direction, so I'm not actually going to use bytes in that way -- I haven't been stuck on it for 2+ hours :D  But I'm still curious to know what I was missing for future reference)

[15:22] <rir> This is my friendly interface for wrapping utimensat: 

[15:22] <rir> touch( Str:D $fn, Instant :access($a), Instant :modify($m), Boolean :NOFOLLOW($b) )

[15:22] <rir> Where the default for absent Instants is now and Instant:U args mean no change.

[15:22] <rir> Good? Bad?

[15:31] <guifa2> hmm, I agree that no instant should be now, that seems like the most common use case anyways

[15:31] <tellable6> hey guifa2, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/70cd76fbc93ac94b403652f059abebcc

[15:36] <guifa2> codesections: right now I don't think there's a way to do a trait other than with "is" 

[15:38] <guifa2> Although clearly the groundwork is layed for me to be able to do trait_mod:<contains> (Mu \positional, :$type-name), it's just not there yet

[15:40] <codesections> guifa2: interesting!  I guess the docs are wrong (or just set in the future…)

[15:41] <guifa2> at least, I've not been able to create a trait using anything other than trait_mod:<is>

[15:41] <codesections> «[A trait] is declared with the trait_mod declarator followed by a colon and a string literal containing the name of the trait»

[15:42] <guifa2> oof, yeah that seems off.  

[15:42] <guifa2> lizmat: thoughts?  You write more traits than anyone else :-) 

[15:42] <codesections> m: multi sub trait_mod:<bar>(Sub $s) { note }; sub qux() bar { say 42 }

[16:31] <BBBB> I wanted to remove perl6.party from the list. It no longer posts new Raku articles and might very soon contain non-Raku, non-programming articles, which will be weird for them to show up in the pl6anet.org feed and raku.org home page that pulls from that feed.
