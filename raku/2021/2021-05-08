[13:20] <kawaii> tyil: I think the IRC <-> Discord bot has been dead for some time, were you the person hosting that or was it someone else?

[13:22] <tyil> that was me, yes

[13:23] <tyil> I'll put it on my todo list to bring it back

[20:23] <Xliff> \o

[20:24] <Xliff> Is there a way to access the grammar used to parse Raku code from Raku user code?

[20:27] <codesections> m: say $*LANG.slang_grammar('MAIN'); # maybe?

[20:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b35fa643: OUTPUT: «Dynamic variable $*LANG not found␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:28] <codesections> I _think_ ^^^ gives you something when not in a REPL, but I don't really understand that aspect (yet).

[20:28] <codesections> it's not really documented 

[20:57] *** Shaeto left
[21:03] *** Shaeto joined
[21:06] <Xliff> Huh! Lang used to work!

[21:07] *** Shaeto left
[21:11] <Xliff> Aha! Looks like it can only be seen inside an EXPORT()

[21:12] <Xliff> Well that sucks.

[21:12] *** Shaeto joined
[21:13] <Xliff> OK, so $*LANG is a Perl6::Grammar. Promising! 

[21:16] *** Shaeto left
[21:21] *** Shaeto joined
[21:22] <Xliff> Trying to use $*LANG.parse results in "Could not locate compile-time value for symbol Block"

[21:22] <Xliff> And that's where I think I'm going to take a break.

[22:47] <Xliff> And that's where I think I'm going to take a break.

[22:48] <Xliff> Um. Bad keyboard.

[22:48] <Xliff> radiak: How do I pass that to the grammar?

[22:48] <Xliff> when I do this: "$*LANG.parse($class-parse, rule => 'term');"

[22:48] <Xliff> Raku gives error: "No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Str'"
