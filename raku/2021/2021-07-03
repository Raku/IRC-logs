[04:15] <perlmaros> lizmat/ugexe: looks like rakudo is only trying to write precomp to the same directory where the code resides - where it does not have write permissions in my case. it could write to ~/.precomp, though - but this directory isn't used. Is there any way to tell rakudo which directory to use?

[05:15] <CIAvash> Raycat|Home: your code works, but on scalar variables. If you want fixed array, you can write `my Square @board[9]`

[05:50] <moon-child> (see also  https://redd.it/o8iddx  for more discussion)
[05:51] <moon-child> (side-note: it would be nice if there were a variant of 'where' that could apply to containers rather than their contents.  E.G.  my @x where' List)
[06:02] <CIAvash> also see https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2368 There are different behaviors for `where` clause used in assignment, binding and parameter.

[06:19] <CIAvash> So currently `sub f (@a where Board){...}` works. Also `my (*@a where Board5) := [<your array>]`, but not `my @a where Board5 := [<your array>]`

[13:29] <ugexe> perlmaros: i guess you could pass an empty directory that has write permissions as the first include (i.e. `-I ./empty-dir -I./dir-with-source` or RAKULIB="./empty-dir,./dir-with-source")

[21:13] <Bobob> Hello world
[21:13] <Bobob> Just started my Raku journey for the summer time, the language is very compelling
[21:14] <El_Che> It's fun
[21:14] <Bobob> super expressive and loose in ways, I was messing around with Golang and I felt really constrained
[21:15] <El_Che> I probably like Raku and Go the most atm
[21:15] <El_Che> they are very different and that's a good thing
[21:16] <Bobob> Go was really my introduction to concurrency
[21:16] <Bobob> goroutines are neat
[21:16] <El_Che> yeah and channels
[21:16] <El_Che> stuff you also find in raku :)
[21:18] <Bobob> yeah raku is really versatile
[21:18] <Bobob> thanks for the convo, cheers
