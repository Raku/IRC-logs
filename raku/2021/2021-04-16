[07:57] <patrickb> japhb: Can you add some bits to the MUGS description about what MUGS *isn't*?

[07:58] <patrickb> Things that I suspect MUGS isn't but don't know: A high performance network stack suitable to drive Multiplayer 3D Action games.

[08:04] <patrickb> japh: Btw. sI really like the project. So heads up!

[08:07] <patrickb> It reminds me of a german website that offers a free service to play a rather large selection of board games and a rather elaborate "lobby" including a Meta game that tracks overall player interaction and has factions. (brettspielwelt.de)

[08:10] <patrickb> It originated in 1998 I think and I suspect is way past its zenith in popularity. But I just recently discovered it and really like it, especially in the current times of social separation.

[13:08] <moritz> gfldex: "In he closing thought" the should be "In *the*"

[13:08] * moritz likes it

[13:09] <lizmat> I've already notified gfldex of this and other typos

[13:22] <demostanis[m]> Does Raku have a builtin cross-platform version of `my ($rows, $columns) = split " ", trim qx+stty size+; say "There are $rows rows and $columns columns."`? 

[13:23] <moritz> I'm pretty sure the answer is "no" :D

[13:23] <lizmat> not in core

[13:26] <demostanis[m]> <lizmat "not in core"> Where?

[13:26] <guifa> there’s a module for it

[13:27] <demostanis[m]> Which

[13:27] <demostanis[m]> ?

[13:27] * lizmat forgets which one

[13:27] <lizmat> greppable6 stty

[13:27] <lizmat> greppable6: stty

[13:27] <greppable6> lizmat, 36 lines, 12 modules: https://gist.github.com/4b74f9388a311548fe7d4248be358000

[13:28] <lizmat> hmmm..... looks like Term::Choose checks that

[13:28] <demostanis[m]> Term::Choose?

[13:28] <demostanis[m]> get-term-size

[13:29] <demostanis[m]> Thanks

[13:29] <lizmat> I don't see a module that exports that functionality like that

[13:29] <lizmat> there's your chance!

[13:29] <guifa> There’s one that gives the width

[13:29] <guifa> But not the height

[13:30] <guifa> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Terminal-Width

[13:30] * lizmat just uploaded https://modules.raku.org/dist/Array::Sorted::Util

[13:31] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[13:31] <demostanis[m]> <guifa "https://github.com/raku-communit"> Why not the height?//

[13:32] <guifa> demostanis[m]: Zoffix probably wasn’t concerned about the height when he wrote it

[13:32] <guifa> but it looks like it should be easy enough to modify it to make Terminal::Height

[13:32] <demostanis[m]> He probably thought terminals are in 1d

[13:33] <guifa> lol 

[13:34] <guifa> Zoffix was like lizmat — lots of super cool/useful modules, but really focused on the done one thing, and do it well principal

[13:37] <ugexe> Terminal::Width is the same code zef used to use to do terminal animations, but i eventually removed it because its way too fragile 

[13:38] <guifa> ugexe: fragile in that it didn’t support enough systems accurately? 

[13:38] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/3c756183d9490cf6ffe8a854e09b526aab22cd65/lib/Zef/Utils/SystemInfo.pm6#L10 is the now removed code

[13:38] <ugexe> in that is often didnt work for systems it should have supported

[13:40] <ugexe> one example can be seen above that code above -- resizing the terminal

[13:40] <guifa> ugexe++ makes sense.  Only asking because I’ve got a few modules that are cross-platform one-stop shops for user information and wanted to see where some pitfalls may be

[13:40] <ugexe> but even without resizing the terminal it just didnt work a lot

[13:40] <ugexe> i think Terminal::Print is the cutting edge when it comes to that stuff

[13:41] <ugexe> in raku

[13:43] <leont> Using tput instead of TIOCGWINSZ seems unfortunate

[13:57] <ugexe> in my defense i think i originally wrote that code before NativeCall existed

[13:58] <ugexe> also at a time when it ran on jvm, so even if nativecall did exist i guess i wouldnt have used it

[15:05] <leont> Can someone think of a easy but reliable way to figure out how many bits a number needs.

[15:05] <lucs> rba: Thanks.

[15:05] <leont> Currently doing «ceiling($number-of-values.log / 2.log)», but surely floating points are going to disappoint me

[15:06] <lucs> How many bits _does_ a floating point require?

[15:06] <leont> I mean how many bits an integer would take

[15:06] *** macarc left
[15:06] <leont> 4 takes 3 bits, 9 would take 4 bits

[15:07] <leont> But .log returns a floating point, so that division may be off, especially if $number-of-values is a power of two and the division is like 4.0000000000001, which ceils to 5 instead of 4

[15:12] <lucs> Ah, I see.

[15:12] <leont> Wait, turns out there is a log2 method!

[15:35] <parv> Is anyone working on Raku(do) port for FreeBSD (either release or straight from Git repository)?

[15:48] <[Coke]> downloads page has BSDunder "Other Platforms" https://rakudo.org/downloads

[15:58] <parv> [Coke], that's new to me, pkgsrc.se; that offers to install from source. In that case I could create a port my self to pull rakudo from Github & adapt their devel/{nqp,moarvm}. OTOH rakubrew looks like self contained for easier (& less flexible) access to Raku.

[16:01] <parv> looks like I would start with rakubrew; move to pulling rakudo, nqp, moarvm from Github & building from source later and/or on popular demand.

[17:51] <japhb> demostanis[m]: stty, tput, TIOCGWINSZ, and "\e[18t" are all viable; MUGS uses that last one (https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-CLI/blob/main/lib/MUGS/UI/CLI/Input.rakumod#L387), Terminal::Print uses the second one (https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/Commands.pm6#L104).

[17:56] <demostanis[m]> I never heard about "\e[18t". How does it work? `echo`ing it on my Terminal doesn't do anything.

[17:57] <japhb> patrickb: MUGS is working its way "up from the bottom", in sorta the same way x86 and ARM have slowly worked their way up.  So right now I absolutely wouldn't try doing a 3D FPS arena game using MUGS as a base.  But I would (and have) done a simple 2D twitch game, and eventually I'll at least support complex 2D twitch games and very simple 3D games, but not in the short term.  Also, I have done nothing about 

[17:57] <japhb> sound support yet.

[17:58] <japhb> patrickb: So I don't want to define MUGS by what it doesn't do (because it might, eventually), but it sounds like you're asking for a first cut of "This isn't going to work for this use case *now*" -- is that what you meant?

[17:59] *** aborazmeh joined
[18:00] <japhb> demostanis[m]: If you look a few lines above at https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-CLI/blob/main/lib/MUGS/UI/CLI/Input.rakumod#L363, you can see the generic query-terminal method.  The idea is that *while in raw mode*, you send a query string to the terminal as an escape sequence and then read back its response (as another escape sequence) and parse it.

[18:03] <demostanis[m]> japhb: What exactly is raw mode? Is there a way to parse the response from my shell (without using Raku)?

[18:07] <japhb> demostanis[m]: I use https://github.com/krunen/term-termios/ to get to raw mode, as you can see in https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-CLI/blob/main/lib/MUGS/UI/CLI/Input.rakumod#L311 -- Raw mode is basically turning off a lot of the default stuff that a terminal driver does to the input and output data, like special handling for certain control characters, converting CR to NL, and so forth.

[18:07] <japhb> It also, critically, allows byte-at-a-time access to the input buffer.

[18:08] <japhb> demostanis[m]: If you're already using shell, than just use stty or tput.

[18:09] <demostanis[m]> Is it cross-platform?

[18:10] <japhb> It's VT100, so about as core as you can get for something that pretends to be a basic terminal.  I use the XTerm Control Sequences doc as my reference, because it gives a lot of detail about exact support levels: https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html

[18:13] <japhb> Actually, not sure if that one is VT100.  I've used a couple different sequences in the past.

[18:13] <demostanis[m]> Oh ok, thanks, I've had never heard about a sequence to get the terminal size before

[18:14] <japhb> Found it.  It's dtterm, later extended by xterm.  Search for XTWINOPS in that doc.

[18:15] <japhb> So yeah, it's not VT100-ancient, but it is pre-xterm ancient.  :-)

[18:16] <japhb> I learned about it spelunking the Linenoise code, when I wanted to understand how they read the current cursor position, since TIOCGWINSZ doesn't give you that and it doesn't even make much sense for stty.

[18:19] <demostanis[m]> If I understand correctly, some control sequences can even set the terminal to fullscreen?

[18:20] <demostanis[m]> `printf "\e[10;0t"` but that doesn't seem to work

[18:20] <demostanis[m]> `printf "\e[10;1t"`* but still doesn't

[18:21] <demostanis[m]> Oh that's xterm-specific

[18:21] <demostanis[m]> And it works on xterm

[20:13] <patrickb> japhb: I had the feeling I didn't grasp what MUGS actually wants to be, probably because the description sounded too broad. But I guess you are simply aiming high. Nothing wrong with that. :-) Adding a "currently you can do... and can't do ..." might be good to give people a perspective though.

[20:13] <patrickb> japhb++

[20:13] <japhb> Decent point, patrickb.  Hmmm, lemme think how I want to phrase that.

[20:17] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[20:17] <japhb> Oh, I'll ask here as well (originally asked in #raku-gamedev), since people have been talking about it.  Since people are asking about action game performance, I clearly need to put a few cycles into doing some twitch gaming for MUGS.  But I need something IP safe, because I really don't want to Provoke The Lawyers.  Any 2D arcade-style games that are known to be safe to clone?  (Tetris and anything by 

[20:18] <japhb> Nintendo are definitely NOT on that list, pretty much the opposite in fact.)

[20:20] <japhb> (To be clear, I don't just want to avoid provoking lawyers, I also want to be respectful of people's desires on that front.  I started with board games in MUGS not because of the ease of implementation, but because it's easy to find board games literally hundreds or even thousands of years old.)

[20:23] <raydiak> I seriously doubt anybody is going to try to claim copyright on an entire genra like a platformer/side scroller, as long as you aren't closely emulating distinctive parts of a specific commercial game like the art, character names, etc. Personally I'm a fan of top-down space shooters.

[20:28] <japhb> raydiak: I actually spent some time reading about the case law on this.  Clones of Asteroids and Galaga were example (real) cases, among others.  As far as I currently understand it, beyond simple asset copying (always a no-no unless *explicitly* freed by the copyright holder), copyright is also held in the general presentation/embodiment, as separate from the ideas.  So "top-down space shooter" is a general 

[20:28] <japhb> idea that can't be copyrighted, but "the enemies look like brightly-colored insects and dive bomb in looping formations" is an embodiment.

[20:28] <japhb> Of course IANAL, so I tend to be conservative in my interpretation of such things.

[20:29] *** brtastic left
[20:30] <raydiak> then don't copy galaga

[20:30] *** neshpion left
[20:31] <raydiak> my point is don't copy anything, pick a genra and make your own thing. and if someone has a legal problem with that, which I'd bet money you won't encounter, then just take it down

[20:31] *** neshpion joined
[20:31] <japhb> I wasn't planning to.  I was asking if anyone knew of 2D arcade games that had been *explicitly freed*, since copyright won't have expired on any computer program ever written.

[20:31] <raydiak> chormium bsu is open source

[20:32] <raydiak> though I'm not fond of its "don't let a single enemy pass you" mechanic

[20:33] <raydiak> "Clarified Artistic License" whatever that means

[20:33] <tadzik> Commander Keen has been freed: https://github.com/keendreams/keen

[20:34] *** Black_Ribbon left
[20:35] <japhb> tadzik: Yeah, that's one of the traps (and typical of id Software historically).

[20:36] <japhb> raydiak: Hmmm, that's not a bad idea.  Especially since it was Artistic License originally and apparently has unique gameplay elements, which is useful.

[20:37] <raydiak> didn't id GPL the first 3 quake engines, eventually?

[20:37] <tadzik> yep

[20:37] <japhb> Yeah, but only the engines.  The data is all still proprietary.

[20:37] <japhb> Same with Doom.

[20:37] <tadzik> japhb: so you're looking for free code, free data?

[20:38] <tadzik> at least with ID there's a very, very strong precedent of "we don't care if you redo the assets":)

[20:38] <raydiak> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_video_games_with_later_released_source_code

[20:38] <raydiak> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games

[20:38] <japhb> Free data more important than free code, but most especially, no one claiming ownership of the general design.

[20:38] <japhb> tadzik: Yeah, that is useful.

[20:39] <tadzik> I don't think there's any example of someone claiming ownership on a 2d platformer

[20:39] <tadzik> unless you literally want a plumber eating mushroom or something :P

[20:39] <japhb> raydiak: A fair number of those are *really deep*, and thus not something I'm going to be able to implement in a couple weeks, but yeah, I will be using those lists eventually.

[20:41] <codesections> re: “IANAL, so I tend to be conservative in my interpretation of such things” – what you said sounds about right to me, and I _am_ a lawyer (though not providing legal advice, etc)

[20:41] <japhb> Uh no, no mushroom-eating plumbers.  :-)

[20:41] <japhb> codesections: Really?  I didn't know we had any in #raku.  :-)

[20:42] <tadzik> teeworlds is *fairly* unique in its design, made from scratch, and narrow in scope

[20:43] <tadzik> you could argue that it's actually a clone of liero or soldat, but I think that's quite a stretch

[20:43] <codesections> Yep.  I was litigating for a huge lawfirm in NYC and they asked me to help out with a legal app they wanted to build.  That's when I discovered that I loved coding more than law

[20:43] <tadzik> well, not a clone, but inspired. Then again, what 2d platformer isn't inspired by something at this point

[20:43] <raydiak> codesections I read that story on your website :) pretty cool

[20:44] <codesections> thanks :)

[20:44] *** brtastic joined
[20:45] <japhb> codesections: I worked with a (gifted) reverse engineer at a company back in ~2000, and when I asked them what they used to do before getting into network protocol analysis, they said they were a lawyer, but had a case that they never thought they'd be able to top, so gave up law to be a programmer instead.  Excellent decision.  :-)

[20:46] <codesections> ha.  Seems like it

[20:46] <raydiak> wrt assets, a quick search turns up things like https://itch.io/game-assets/free and https://opengameart.org/ ...maybe there'd be something useful in there somewhere?

[20:47] <japhb> raydiak: That's a good idea, I should see if I can find some not-horrible-together sets with CC0 or so.
