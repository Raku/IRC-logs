[01:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> thanks

[01:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> const char  *string is Str in Raku?

[01:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> I try to play with Nativecall

[01:46] <Voldenet> yes

[01:53] <guifa> hrm, found another big (I had a < where the C original had a >, d'oh) but still haven't tracked down the new-disp error

[01:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> Function(const char *str){}. Cant find how it use from NativeCall

[01:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> will never work with declared signature (Str)

[17:06] <patrickb> tbrowder: I might be wrong, but I think jnthn has the intention to build RakuAST in rakudo/src/Raku and drop rakudo/src/Perl6 after RakuAST went live. Could be I confuse this with some other dir though.

[17:10] <lizmat> yes, I think that's the plan

[17:18] <Xliff> lang-call cannot invoke object of type 'VMNull' belonging to no language

[17:18] <lizmat> that feels like a dispatcher dropping the ball somewhere along the way

[21:19] <eof> multiple here-documents on the same line is a truly terrifying prospect when writing syntax highlighters

[21:22] <eof> i looked into whether treesitter could handle raku for this, and it doesn't seem like it has the capacity to fully support some of the language constructs.

[21:28] <MasterDuke> interesting, i'd wondered that

[21:35] <eof> as-is, i currently have a string propertizer for emacs that can deal with the entire range of adverbs and quoting constructs (save for heredoc) correctly and I'm currently thinking about how I want to approach heredoc.

[22:44] <tbrowder> eof: a proper heredoc handler for emacs would be most welcome!

[22:46] <tbrowder> as a hint, reading the Synopsis 2 on heredocs might help you see how Raku parses them

[22:55] <eof> I had actually had a working prototype for heredoc built around a previous strategy, but rethought the way things currently work a bit.

[22:56] <eof> the strategy described in Syn.2 si optimal; however, the current approach I am using in emacs is still a "dumb" linear analysis that decorates text and moves on. this is primarily for the sake of efficiency. 

[22:57] <eof> i think i would ideally store a parse tree and then walk that to decorate text. it would work better; however, assembling a quality tree in emacs would require almost completely implementing and maintaining a raku parser in emacs

[22:59] <eof> i have wondered if the best approach is to write some raku that can spit out the parse tree for a file in sexprs and then emacs can work over that. the primary issues I can think of for this approach are that I'm not certain that I can easily get quality parse trees for invalid or incomplete code, and that there is potential for noticeable lag when updating the document - asynchronous execution of the raku code would prevent the interface from freezing, but font faces 

[22:59] <eof> would update slower than you could type

[23:11] <eof> perhaps i'll play with cedet/semantic and see if that is a good fit

[23:16] <eof> and then there's the matter of that being stale

[23:27] <eof> it looks like treesitter can pull of heredocs with interpolation, so that's promising. dealing with balanced parens may be a bit tricky

[23:27] <eof> plus the wide range of possible interpolations that may or may not be possible
