[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <pie_flavor#7868> neither `[+] ¬´(` nor `[+¬´] (` seem to have done it
[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <pie_flavor#7868> if I write the first one, my IDE starts highlighting it all as a string.
[08:56] <moon-child> in this case, you could use @x.map(&sum)
[08:58] <moon-child> (or, well, @x¬ª.sum)
[09:00] <discord-raku-bot> <pie_flavor#7868> right. second question, since my goal is to golf aoc21 as much as possible: if I've got a computed list `[Z]`'d together, and then I need to use it like `@x[0..*-1] Z @x[1..*]`, is there any way to do that all on one line without putting the first list in an actual `@x` variable?

[15:24] <Guest12> lizmat: Did a search (channel: '#perl6', query: 'macros', nick: 'TimToady').
[15:25] <Guest12> It worked. But results began with latest.
[15:25] <lizmat> ah, so this is more a feature request  :-)
[15:25] <Guest12> No
[15:25] *** lichtkind joined
[15:26] <lizmat> you should be able to scroll up to get earlier results
[15:26] <Guest12> Yes. I tried that. That worked. But I wanted results from maybe 10 years ago. 
[15:27] <Guest12> So I tried to set Until: to 2011. (First I did that wrong, but didn't notice, and got latest results again.)
[15:27] <Guest12> When I set Until to be Jan 1 2011 I got a 500 error message again

[15:31] <lizmat> hmmm...could you do a reload on that ?
[15:32] <lizmat> also: https://logs.liz.nl/perl6/2006-02-22.html#22:24-0002 is the first hing TimToady said on channel

[15:34] <lizmat> which I'm not in the right mindset right now
[15:34] <Guest12> lizmat: Interesting. It works if I don't specify nick: TimToady
[15:35] <Guest12> lizmat: FYI, imo the search UI is pretty fabulous in general
[15:35] <lizmat> could you post the URL that you get?   they're all GETs, for easy passing URLs
[15:35] <Guest12> hang on
[15:37] <Guest12> lizmat: https://logs.liz.nl/search.html?query=macros&type=words&nicks=TimToady&channel=perl6&message-type=&from-yyyymmdd=2005-02-26&to-yyyymmdd=2011-01-01

[18:25] <hobbs> decided to have fun and see how much of Advent of Code I could do in Raku. #1 is, of course, pretty easy, but I produced a few different versions going from a line-by-line translation of the p5 version to a clever little almost-pointfree version. Anyone care to look and see if there are ways I could make it prettier, or other cool approaches?
[18:25] <[Coke]> oh right, I don't think I finished AOC from <checks, last ever?>
