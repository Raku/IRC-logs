[09:25] <jjatria> tib: Thanks for the slot in the miniconf! I was actually thinking about giving a talk on my experiences using Perl's FFI::Platypus. It's less sugary than NativeCall, but equally liberating

[13:00] <timo> ^- our website is updated automatically when there are git changes, correct?
[13:01] <timo> ah, yes, the readme says so
[13:03] <timo> the readme says to ping zoffix if you can't run the sass css preprocessor yourself, that part can probably go or at least mention someone else who should be able to help?

[13:13] <Ven_de_Thiel> o/
[13:15] <Ven_de_Thiel> I'm getting an error when trying to use --profile on OSX, did anyone encounter something similar?
[13:16] <Ven_de_Thiel> Unhandled exception: Cannot invoke null object at SETTING::src/core.c/ThreadPoolScheduler.pm6:284 (...) from <unknown>:1 (.../CORE.c.setting.moarvm:THREAD-ENTRY)
[13:18] <lizmat> Ven_de_Thiel o/
[13:18] <lizmat> is that on master?
[13:19] <Ven_de_Thiel> I tried both on master and on tag 2021.08
[13:19] <lizmat> ok, if it is also on 2021.08, then it is not something I did yesterday
[13:19] *** frost left
[13:19] <lizmat> what is the code you're trying to profile?
[13:22] <Ven_de_Thiel> I tried several cro modules... I should try to find a reduced test case
[13:29] <lizmat> generally, the --profile has a hard with async programs   timo:  right?
[13:29] <lizmat> *time
[13:30] <timo> with --profile giving you a html or json output, yes. with sql output, no
[13:30] <timo> but that exception there, that's new to me
[13:30] <timo> normally --profile with html output just gives you info about one of the threads
[13:39] <Ven_de_Thiel> `await Promise.in(2);` doesn't bug out
