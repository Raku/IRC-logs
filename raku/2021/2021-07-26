[08:24] <patrickb> lizmat: I just noticed that the sidebar in the rakulang reddit topic is outdated in several places. I think you have permissions to change the sidebar. Could you: - Change the download section to just link to rakudo.org (rakudo.org hosts a quite all encompassing overview of the different download options. Duplicating it in different places will always miss options and become out of date). - Maybe switch modules.raku.org over to raku.land. - Cha
[08:25] <patrickb> - Change freenode to libera. - Change colabti to liz.nl (or irclogs.raku.org should that already be available.)
[08:26] <lizmat> looking at it now.... the mod tools are a bit...  confusing  :-)
[08:51] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[08:54] <lizmat> patrickb: I think I covered all  now on the new as well as the old reddit
[08:54] <patrickb> lizmat: Thank you! That was really guick.
[08:54] <patrickb> There are two reddits?
[08:54] <lizmat> felt like it took hours though  :-)
[08:56] <patrickb> The downloads bit still only lists Star and rakudo-pkg. Did you miss that or was it intentional?
[08:58] <lizmat> I guess I misunderstood what you meant?   
[08:58] <lizmat> sidebar or menu?
[08:59] <lizmat> old / new reddit ?   :-)
[09:01] <patrickb> Uhm.. I have only looked at the thingy on the right. I didn't know there were two reddits (link?). Oh! There is a menu! Never noticed that!
[09:03] <patrickb> To be more explicit I looked at the box labeled "Links" on the right of the feed at this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/ The second subhading labeled "Installation" is what I referred to.
[09:04] <japhb> Decided to pull my data structure serialization codec tests out into a repo of its own.  https://github.com/japhb/serializer-perf if anyone is curious what the lay of the land at this moment.
[09:05] <moon-child> couple of other things I noticed: there is a link to ideone.com, which does not seem to support raku (perhaps it used to, then changed?); the cheat sheet link labeled 'pdf' does not link to a pdf, but to a github page containing only svgs; the cheat sheet link labeled 'ascii' might be better called 'text'; the link labeled 'mailing lists' and the link labeled 'community' point to the same page
[09:05] <lizmat> patrickb: so what link is incorrect now?
[09:06] <patrickb> I'd remove the Rakudo *, Docker and rakudo-pkg links altogether and instead link to https://rakudo.org/downloads
[09:12] <lizmat> patrickb: done
[09:12] <patrickb> lizmat: Looking good. Thank you!
[09:14] <lizmat> moon-child: removed ideone
[09:15] <lizmat> the really annoying thing is that everything must be done twice :-(

[11:48] <Doc_Holliwood> (Int) routine is-prime
[11:48] <Doc_Holliwood> Returns True if this Int is known to be a prime, or is likely to be a prime based on a probabilistic Miller-Rabin test.
[11:49] <Doc_Holliwood> What exactly does "known" mean?
[11:49] <Doc_Holliwood> Does Raku keep a list of primes somewhere? And if it does, why can't I access it?
[11:51] <lizmat> Doc_Holliwood: I think that is hidden somewhere in the library that's used for primes, somewhere in MoarVM land
[11:52] <Doc_Holliwood> Might be worth it to expose that, yes?
[11:52] <Doc_Holliwood> $*PRIMES =)
[11:52] <lizmat> but why?
[11:53] <lizmat> could well be a bitmap
[11:53] <Doc_Holliwood> Because primes are used for a lot of things
[11:55] <lizmat> so you'd want to randomly select a prime?
[11:55] <lizmat> or get the next prime?
[11:55] <tbrowder> japhb: do you plan to add TOML or HJSON?

[12:10] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: it's so fast to calculate whether or not something is prime that it isn't worth the memory to keep a list around

[17:09] <Util> No! Bad evalable6! Don't let it be true! Rakudo could not possibly use a O(NlogN) algo for min, when O(N) is so easy!
[17:22] <[Coke]> Util: should be easy enough to check the algo used.

[17:22] <ugexe> probably loops over the elements once, but runs the block multiple times
[17:24] <Util> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/74d7ff771afb17eaec200e7804710af820ca6cf2/src/core.c/Any-iterable-methods.pm6#L1586
[17:26] <Util> Whew, it is 2N instead of NlogN. Still needs fixing via caching of the &by value of the current $min, but not nearly as bad as I thought.
[17:27] <Util> m: my @n = 1..1000; my $c; my $min = @n.min({ $c++; 1  }); say $c;
[17:27] <evalable6> Util, rakudo-moar 74d7ff771: OUTPUT: «1998␤»
[17:27] <[Coke]> caching should probably be done via 'is cached'
[17:27] <ugexe> caching an intermeditary list, not the result of the method
[17:28] <ugexe> schwartzian transform essentially
[17:30] <Util> Coke: 'is cached' is overkill for this. Just keep an extra loop variable, replaced when $min changes.
[17:32] *** nahita joined
[17:32] <Util> ugexe: we don't even need an intermediate list, just a variable declared outside the loop, that is conditionally updaed inside the loop.
[17:35] <ugexe> m: my $c; my &foo := { $c++; $^a }; my @n = 45,41,42,43,44; my $min = @n.sort(&foo).head; say $c; say $min
[17:35] <evalable6> ugexe, rakudo-moar 74d7ff771: OUTPUT: «5␤41␤»
[17:35] <ugexe> sort with single arity will swartizian transform already
[17:38] <Util> ugexe: Yes, Raku has fantastic sorting, but min and max should not need to sort. They are done with just a linear scan, a single pass is sufficient.
[17:39] <ugexe> that example is also a linear scan with a single pass, no?
[17:39] <Util> ugexe: Oops, I think I mistook your point.
[17:41] <ugexe> although for a min/max it wouldnt be ideal memory wise i suppose
[17:44] <Util> ugexe: right; when sorting, if you don't want to ever re-evaluate the comparitor for a value, you must cache or use S.T. or some such trick.
[17:44] <Util> In a min or max, the cache only needs to be one value.

[17:45] <japhb> tbrowder: Someone had said that TOML wasn't very good for serializing data structures, but if that was just "not as good as other things, but still technically works", I'm fine with adding it.  HJSON I'm unfamiliar with.  Do we already have a module for that?
[17:48] <tbrowder> japhb: yes, there is a raku module, it’s loose json, allows comment, etc. converts to json easily.
[17:50] <japhb> tbrowder: OK, sure, I can add those.
