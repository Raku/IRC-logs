[06:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> NativeCall works fine, except libs created by FASM assembler. Why?

[10:23] <samebchase> If I have a string to be interpolated like: "$_[0] $_[1]{'s' if $_[0] > 1}" using '{ <arbitrary-code> }' without a space in front of the first '{' seems to be treating it like a hash lookup. How do I disambiguate this?

[10:24] <samebchase> Never mind, "$_[0] {$_[1]}{'s' if $_[0] > 1}" seems to work

[16:16] <melezhik> I added minimalist yet formatting for  mybfio reviews - https://twitter.com/melezhik2/status/1451220070827442176

[16:16] <melezhik> yet -> yet having some feature 

[16:18] <melezhik> https://gist.github.com/melezhik/b74e236519095d23ea2d17aa951ebac4

[16:18] <dakkar> I keep reading that as "my boyfriend dot i o"

[16:19] <melezhik> dakkar not you only LOL - ðŸ˜‚ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28870006

[16:20] <melezhik> Sorry I am not a native speaker, apparently need to change the domain name 

[16:20] <melezhik> I did not anticipate this association ))

[16:21] <dakkar> changing the name may be a good idea, yes â˜º but wait for more than two people to say so!

[16:21] <melezhik> from other hand it is quite catchy, huh ? LOL ðŸ˜‚

[17:07] <timo> i wouldn't have an issue frequenting a website that's nicknamed "my boyfriend i o"

[17:07] <timo> that is pretty funny

[17:07] <idiosyncrat> Hi! I asked raiph about the Raku community's experience with domain registrar's wrt gandi in particular, and he suggested I ask here.

[17:08] *** melezhik joined
[17:08] <idiosyncrat> It's a bit off-topic, but raiph suggested that was OK.

[17:08] <melezhik> basically this link describes formatting rules for mybfio posts - https://mybf.io/article/Formatting

[17:09] <idiosyncrat> I am the author of Marpa and our two communities have been friendly for some time.

[17:09] <idiosyncrat> In particular, the Perl 6 / Raku folks have long been extremely helpful to us with advice.
