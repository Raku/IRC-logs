[13:17] <tbrowder> has anyone been getting mail sent to their @cpan.org account? i tried back in nov an again just a couple of days ago and nothing. i have been trying to reach another cpan author and he hasn't been seeing anything either. i do get auto email from cpan about my module, though.

[13:19] <tbrowder> it may be gmail throttling me somehow. can someone please send a test mail to me at <mailto:tbrowder@cpan.org>? many thanks

[13:27] <tib> zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/sparky.git

[13:27] <tib> All installs fine

[13:27] <tib> but 

[13:27] <tib> zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6.git https://github.com/melezhik/sparrowdo.git https://github.com/melezhik/sparky.git

[13:28] <tib> reports a resolving issue

[13:28] <tib> "Failed to resolve some missing dependencies"

[13:29] <tib> Because sparky requires Data::Dump:ver<2.0.0+> when Sparrow6 require Data::Dump:ver<1.0.0> 

[13:30] <tib> but I thought that zef was able to handle this (threat each git repo as independent)

[13:30] <tib> What do you think

[13:36] <v_m_v> it is funny becouse I also have issues with zef but with IO::Path::ChildSecure. I can not fetch it and to be hones I don't understand why.

[13:37] <tib> v_m_v fetching and install OK for me

[13:38] <tib> what says verbose

[13:38] <tib> recent zef ? recent raku ?

[13:39] <v_m_v> yes. It is funny becouse it is happening only on chromebook (on the virtualized debian) and only with that lib. Cro::HTTP has been fetched fine.

[13:40] <tbrowder> tib: got it, thanks!

[13:44] <v_m_v> When I am running zef install with --force-fetch then I am getting: "No such method 'parent' for invocant of type 'Any'.  Did you mean 'print'?"

[18:37] <Guest28650> I have tried create a model with a Floating Point column and the sqlite backend.

[18:41] <moritz> how did it not work?

[18:44] <Guest28650> All the created columns Num, Numeric and Rat in the resulting table are varchar(255) columns.

[18:44] *** sena_kun left
[18:44] <moritz> you could also try num

[18:45] <moritz> though that wouldn't map onto the "REAL" storage class either

[21:41] <v_m_v> Hello. I have generated my project with InteliJ plugin for Cro. I would like to add a new dependiency into my project. For that I have to add it into META6.json file in depends?

[21:50] <sena_kun> v_m_v, to install the dependency, you need to use an actual package manager (zef), something like `zef install My::Nice::Dependency`. Adding it to META6.json just specifies the dependency, but there is no machinery in Comma to automagically install it or something.

[21:53] <v_m_v> sena_kun: I see. I am trying to install XML::XPath and I am getting error: https://pastebin.com/xSCbVQmr he can not find "Test"

[21:57] <sena_kun> v_m_v, cannot reproduce it. :/ It is very odd to not find the Test module, it is shipped with Rakudo.

[21:58] *** stoned75 left
[21:58] <v_m_v> I know. I have  installed a bunch of Cro packages without any problems.

[21:59] <sena_kun> v_m_v, what if you try `zef install https://github.com/ufobat/p6-XML-XPath.git`?

[22:00] <v_m_v> the same issue

[22:01] <sena_kun> v_m_v, hmm. Ok, what if you explicitly `git clone` the repo, cd inside and `zef install .`?

[22:02] <v_m_v> sena_kun: you mean `zef install ./META6.json` ?

[22:02] <sena_kun> no

[22:03] <sena_kun> In the directory where META6.json of the clonned XML::XPath is, where dot at the end states "the path of the current directory".

[22:04] <v_m_v> I see. Ok, I have the same issue.

[22:04] <sena_kun> v_m_v, can you just `raku` into REPL and type `use Test` there?

[22:04] <sena_kun> It should respond with `Nil`

[22:04] <v_m_v> wow...no I cannot....

[22:05] <sena_kun> Ok, so the module is innocent. I wonder if your Rakudo distribution somehow got corrupted.

[22:05] <sena_kun> Anything comes to mind? Also, which way did you use to install it?

[22:05] <v_m_v> I have installed it by rakudobrew

[22:07] * sena_kun has to go afk, but an attempt to re-install may help, plus check `which zef` and `which raku` (if they are pointing to a sane place?).

[22:07] <v_m_v> both of them are pointing into:/home/michmajchrzak/.rakubrew/shims/

[22:08] *** andrzejku left
[22:09] <sena_kun> v_m_v, mine points to /home/koto/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2020.10/install/bin/raku and /home/koto/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2020.10/install/share/perl6/site/bin/zef, I wonder if you need to do a `rakubrew switch $version` after you did `rakubrew build $foo; rakubrew build zef`? Though if you did install cro packages, this looks like a mystery.

[22:11] <v_m_v> So, remove rakudobrew? with .rakudobrew folder and install it once again?

[22:12] <sena_kun> v_m_v, I would firstly try to recover just the rakudo version rakudobrew installed. First, check `rakubrew list` to check what version has an asterisk, then do `rakubrew nuke $that-line-without-asterisk`, then `rakubrew build $version; rakubrew switch $version; rakubrew build zef`.

[22:12] <sena_kun> If it does not help...
