[08:36] <xinming> For a grammar, How can we get all the match?

[08:54] <lizmat> doesn't $/ contain a tree of all matches ?

[08:55] *** user51 joined
[08:56] <user51> where can i find information about the whys behind raku? i'm specifically interested in the grammars and lazy evaluation

[09:02] <Skarsnik> It's probably in the apocalypse (or whatever the name of the draft documents for Perl 6)

[09:06] <SmokeMachine> can anyone reproduce [this](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3959)?

[09:07] <Altreus> markdown support in IRC when?

[09:07] <Altreus> :D

[09:10] <xinming> lizmat: I use my $match = MyGrammar.subparse($str);   <--- It'll return the first matched result.

[09:10] <Skarsnik> thanks lizmat :)

[09:13] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: running your last comment in a fairly large dir and not seeing the issue

[09:13] <Altreus> not hitting symlinks are you?

[09:14] <Altreus> oh wait

[09:14] <Altreus> ... not oh wait, I thought it wasn't running but it is :D

[09:14] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: oh! I got one!

[09:14] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: It takes som tries...

[09:15] <SmokeMachine> *some

[09:15] <Altreus> there's nothing special about the file either

[09:16] <SmokeMachine> and, at least for me, the file giving the problem keeps changing...

[09:16] <Altreus> I can reproduce it but I can't offer any further insights

[09:17] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: Thanks, I just wanted to be sure that's not specific to my environment.

[09:19] <Altreus> added a comment :)

[09:19] <SmokeMachine> xinming: would `my $match = MyGrammar.parse($str);` do what you want?

[09:19] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: thanks!

[09:22] <xinming> SmokeMachine: Nope, the Grammar.parse will need the whole string to match the grammar, But I want to extract only all interesting parts out of a string.

[09:30] <Altreus> looks like I can get at least one file to go wrong each time through

[09:30] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: does it only happen async?

[09:31] <lizmat> abs2rel depends on $*SPEC, I wonder whether there's a race condition in start on dynamic var lookup somehow

[09:32] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: I couldn't get it sync...

[09:33] <El_Che> weekly: rakudo-pkgs up

[09:33] <notable6> El_Che, Noted! (weekly)

[09:34] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: $*SPEC? I was trying to see if $*CWD was different on those errors...

[09:35] <lizmat> that could also be the case

[09:35] <lizmat> an IO path has both a local copy of $*CWD and $*SPEC on creation by default

[09:36] <lizmat> El_Che: liz@DebianMini:~$ raku -v   Welcome to ùêëùêöùê§ùêÆùêùùê®‚Ñ¢ v2021.09.     :-)

[09:40] <El_Che> :)

[09:49] <raydiak> xinming: grammars aren't really meant to be used like that, a somewhat cleaner solution would be to change your TOP rule to accept strings of .*? between the relevant parts. that said, you could messily kinda force what you want like this:

[09:49] <raydiak> m: grammar G { our token TOP { . } }; say "foo" ~~ m:g/<{G::<&TOP>}>/

[09:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar b2bfa4dec: OUTPUT: ¬´(ÔΩ¢fÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢oÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢oÔΩ£)‚ê§¬ª

[09:52] *** chenyf joined
[09:54] *** chenyf left
[10:04] <raydiak> seriously though, restructuring your TOP rule something like this would be a step up from that nonsense:

[10:04] <raydiak> m: grammar G { regex TOP { .*? <relevant>+ %% .*? }; token relevant { \w } }; say G.parse(" f o o ")<relevant>

[10:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar b2bfa4dec: OUTPUT: ¬´[ÔΩ¢fÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢oÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢oÔΩ£]‚ê§¬ª

[11:08] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: I did ¬´ my $a = .relative ~ " $*CWD"; ¬ª and $*CWD was correct by the time it was evaluated

[11:10] <Altreus> I noticed also that you included .relative *again* in the die and it had become correct by then

[12:38] <raydiak> xinming: you're welcome, glad I could help. :) someone backlogging in the next several hours might have a cleaner approach, but some approximation of those two are the only I can think of

[12:39] <raydiak> sleep &

[12:42] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: The implication is that evaluating $*CWD is always correct, and so maybe .relative doesn't use that but something underneath it

[12:42] <Altreus> that is, maybe accessing $*CWD forces a sync or something, which .relative doesn't trigger

[12:42] <Altreus> but hang on, why would .relative think the file is in ..

[12:43] <Altreus> it would have to believe cwd is ./something

[12:47] <ugexe> im pretty sure ive seen that .relative bug in bug reports to zef before fwiw, but i never knew it had been golfed and reported to rakudo

[12:50] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: yes, that's why I thought $*CWD should be something different on the error cases...

[12:52] <Altreus> hmm

[12:53] <Altreus> I'm getting it to die if $*CWD is ever not my homedir, hard-coded

[12:54] <Altreus> I expect it not to

[12:56] <Altreus> yeah no dying

[12:56] <Altreus> must be something that's not leaking out to the user level

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I am looking for ways to use a Java JAR file (the classes in it) within a Raku program. I did not succeed finding a module are discussion about that. Any pointers? Should I look into Perl5 modules for that?

[14:49] <MasterDuke> Anton Antonov: i assume you mean using rakudo running on the jvm backend? i don't think that's possible, but bartolin_ would be a good person to ask

[14:54] <MasterDuke> Anton Antonov: i just asked jonathan worthingon your question and he said "I thought something like that was implemented, but it's been years since I looked, so I've really no idea."

[14:55] <MasterDuke> the jvm backend hasn't had a whole lot of development recently, you might try searching for older perl 6 blog posts

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> #MasterDuke Thank you for response! I have to say, I am looking for any possible solution, e.g. (1) using JVM backend, (2) connecting to a Java server, or (3) using "native call" or something. From your answers -- at this point -- I will simply not look for using/connecting to Java from Raku.

[15:22] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/raku/rakudo/RakudoJavaInterop.java looks like maybe something is possible?

[16:10] <xinming> in .grep(...)   Is there shorter way to write something like,  .grep(* !~~ /^ \s+ '#' /);   ??

[16:11] <xinming> it's just use negative value of regex

[16:15] <Altreus> according to the doc

[16:15] <Altreus> say <a b c d e f>.grep(none /<[aeiou]>/);   # OUTPUT: ¬´(b c d f)‚ê§¬ª

[16:15] <Altreus> not that one

[16:15] <Altreus> say <a b c d e f>.grep({! /<[aeiou]>/})     # OUTPUT: ¬´(b c d f)‚ê§¬ª

[16:15] <Altreus> that one

[19:48] <gabriel80546> the great guy named Max Kapusta on stackoverflow have figured that out.

[19:48] <gabriel80546> all you need is to use the app UserLand and install rakudo with `sudo apt install rakudo`
