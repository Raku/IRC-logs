[08:36] <PimDaniel> o/

[08:36] <tellable6> 2021-03-11T18:01:11Z #raku <guifa2> PimDaniel: taht's the best way to do it.

[08:39] * PimDaniel thank's guifa2!

[08:39] <PimDaniel> O/

[08:39] <PimDaniel> New question:

[08:42] <PimDaniel> Is it possible to have or a trick to have  a (kindof) <Int,Int> hash key into and hash?

[08:44] <PimDaniel> Or is it better to use a 2 dimentional Array or even a one dimentionnal fixed size array in that case?

[08:44] *** Geth left
[08:47] <japhb> PimDaniel: Why are you wanting numeric hash keys?  What problem are you solving?  (My first guess would be sparse multidimensional data.)

[08:49] <japhb> IIUC underneath the covers all hash keys are strings, BUT Raku hides this by allowing you to declare an a hash to be keyed with some other type (e.g. `my %hash{Int}`), and the magic to make that work will be hidden away.  It's not guaranteed to be performance-optimal, though.

[08:51] <japhb> lizmat++ would be know more I think -- IIRC she wrote most of that magic.

[08:51] <japhb> *would know

[08:52] <japhb> (Well, the Rakudo implementation, at least)

[10:41] * PimDaniel japhb yes it's just 2D plan with x and y coords!

[10:46] <PimDaniel> I need a fast indexing performance, well let's say that it would be better. Because i call this at many places into my code and into loops so may be the impact could be important.

[10:47] <PimDaniel> Why  a simple a 2D array should not be so fair?

[10:48] <PimDaniel> The problem being that many values will return any.

[10:49] <PimDaniel> Here's the problem : i build an Orthogon or an Orthogonal polygon so it has points but it does not have all points (lines * colums).

[10:51] <lizmat> what would be the value of a point?  0/1  or something else ?

[10:53] <PimDaniel> If i use an hash i'll optimize memory. If use a fixed buffer position, and performances will depend of the internal hash algorithm,  i'll optimize performances. If i use a 2D array i think it is the same and may be more practical.

[10:54] *** peri404 left
[10:54] * PimDaniel lizmat Point is Class Point{has Int ($.x,$.y);}.  

[10:55] <lizmat> any additional attributes to Point ?

[10:56] <PimDaniel> Don't think so. but Point object can be addressed by a simple x and y.

[10:57] <lizmat> and the Point object is immutable ?

[10:58] *** xinming_ left
[10:58] <PimDaniel> of Course it has methods. for example method fix() { gotoxy($!x,$!y); print $!motif; }, yes it has motif attribute too. 

[10:58] *** xinming_ joined
[10:58] <lizmat> ok, then my idea is moot  :-)

[11:00] <PimDaniel> immutable good question .... Yes,  my may modify it be i dit not do it but i can change attributes rw to ro for that.

[11:00] <PimDaniel> what is moot?

[11:03] <lizmat> well, a solution i had in mind won't work  :-)

[11:05] <PimDaniel> Often the most trivial for this is the best : even a one array will consume : echo "$LINES * COLS" | bc ==> 809919 octet static size for my most resoluted pseudo terminal.

[11:06] <PimDaniel> * often a one D array

[11:07] <PimDaniel> And then each array contains a point address := affected or Any if there's no point. 

[11:08] <PimDaniel> Well it's not  809919 it's 809919 * (size of an adress container). which is internal to Raku.

[11:09] <PimDaniel> I don't think it's so weird. Finally. 

[11:10] <PimDaniel> * And then each array contains : i mean each array element.

[11:12] <PimDaniel> i must leave to have a walk, see you later.

[14:22] * leont doesn't like the list comprehension example in the Python to Raku guide.

[14:23] <leont> Why would you write « { $_[0] + $_[1] } for (3,9) X (2,10)» when you can write «(3,9) X+ (2,10)»

[14:25] <codesections> leont: to introduce the X operator before introducing meta ops, as a guess

[14:25] <leont> We can do both? First give the longer pythonesque version, and then the shorter one?

[14:26] <codesections> yeah, that seems good.  (Though it does require explaining meta ops at that moment, which could be a digression.)

[14:27] <leont> Does it? The document doesn't have to explain all it does, it can also link to other documentation

[14:27] <codesections> (also, I'm not a python programmer and haven't read that guide, so I'm just shooting the breeze; no need to listen to any of the above :D)

[14:29] <leont> I'm not a python programmer either, just reading it now because it was updated yesterday

[14:29] <leont> It's pretty good actually, that was my only complaint with it

[14:37] <leont> (OTOH, this did completely change my opinion on how useful the X meta operator is)

[14:41] <codesections> what's the Routine/Block/Sub like type that's something like "loaded function"?  I forget the exact name and can't find it in the docs

[18:42] <rba> RaycatWhoDat: You may try https://docs.rakulang.site/ . Yet since mid of last week docs.raku.org and docs.rakulang.site MUST point to the same IP as I have turned of CDN on cloudflare. Please report if the ip differs.

[18:42] <tellable6> rba, I'll pass your message to RaycatWhoDat

[18:45] <rba> My best bet would be that some DNS in US are not following the rules and have old information.

[18:46] <codesections> rba: that could well be it.  I've learned to _never_ bet against the problem being DNS related

[18:48] <rba> LOL

[19:05] <raydiak> rba: I must log in with services to pm you, so I'm communicating with you here instead

[19:05] <raydiak> rba: https://ibin.co/5uvj4O6M4TE6.png as you can see, it is resolving to the proper IP. where your server should be sending a ServerHello in response to my ClientHello during the TLS handshake, it is instead sending 256 FF bytes. I have no idea why. docs.rakulang.site works perfect every time.

[19:08] <rba> raydiak: Are you enforcing a certain TLS version?

[19:09] <raydiak> rba: stock kubuntu setup, I haven't changed any of that. this happens with all client whether chromium, firefox, or even curl

[19:12] <raydiak> rba: just verified it also is repeatable from my android phone on the same wifi. wifi is just an ordinary comcast wifi cable modem on an ordinary residential account, nothing unusual. the rest of the internet works as usual.

[19:12] *** benkolera joined
[19:16] <raydiak> rba: and even if the handshake fails because of a TLS version mismatch, 256 FF bytes is not the way that failure should manifest. that's a very bizarre thing I've never seen before in all my past life as a web dev, admin, CTO, and other things. just very very strange behavior, especially since the same server at the other domain works totally fine

[19:17] <rba> On the server end it's an ordinary nginx.

[19:17] <rba> with ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

[19:18] <raydiak> I've googled it several times different ways in recent days, haven't found anyone else reporting the same thing, it's truly a mystery

[19:20] <rba> nginx version: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)

[19:21] <rba> raydiak: Is for you the https://docs.rakulang.site/ working?

[19:21] <raydiak> if one domain name works and the other doesn't, all I can think is look at any nginx config differences between the two domains

[19:22] <rba> It's even in the same config file... Hmmm.

[19:22] <raydiak> yes, https://docs.rakulang.site/ always works great

[19:24] <rba> raydiak: https://gist.github.com/rba/c11feff2a67fe3d74bf170e32ba036dc

[19:24] <codesections> raydiak: does traceroute show any notable differences between the paths to the two sites?

[19:24] <raydiak> in fact, once I load https://docs.rakulang.site/ in one tab and it succeeds and establishes a persistent connection, I can access https://docs.raku.org/ just fine too in another tab, until I wait a couple minutes for the persistent connection to be closed. then it's back to failing at the handshake

[19:24] <codesections> wow.  That is bizarre...

[19:25] <raydiak> traces are the same, but good thought

[19:27] <raydiak> I almost wondered if there could be cloudflare weirdness at the ARP level, but clearly I'm accessing the same machine either way since the connection persists

[19:28] <raydiak> but yeah it's weird, only fails at that step of the handshake. if I push it past that with the other domain which works, then both domains work fine over https. just something about the handshake on the one domain...

[19:32] <codesections> are these servers in VPSs/containers?  I'm starting to wonder if blowing away the misbehaving one and redeploying would be easier...

[19:32] <rba> raydiak: yeah. really weird

[19:32] <raydiak> rba: you could check your access and error logs, see if it says anything helpful. if you want to look for my traffic, my v4 IP is currently 67.183.224.141 and v6 is 2601:602:d100:1020:2155:2a3c:8f57:7f23

[19:33] <rba> It's just the same nginx and serving all the content. And even the two hostnames are configured in the same nging config part.

[19:33] <rba> Hmm. Maybe a v4/v6 issue?

[19:35] <raydiak> I doubt v4 vs v6, since both domains are configured the same on the same server

[19:35] <raydiak> it is a multi-domain ssl cert, right?

[19:46] <raydiak> in fact it looks like a single-domain cert for docs.raku.org. That's the only difference I can think of so far: the failing domain does match the certificate, while the working domain isn't named in the cert (but resolves to the same IP)

[20:04] <rba> It's a single certificate with X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: DNS:docs.raku.org, DNS:docs.rakulang.site

[20:05] <rba> do you get a ipv6 address? for either of the two hostnames?

[20:06] <raydiak> everywhere I've seen it while testing so far, it's resolving to IPv4 on this machine

[20:07] <rba> I think I have not taken care of properly configuring ipv6 for this host

[20:08] <rba> Yet if cloudflare is enabled there might be a v6 listener which forwards to v4; which is turned off now as we use "dns only" atm.

[20:09] <rba> I have log entries from 67.183.224.141 today

[20:12] <raydiak> oh right, I see the alternative name now. and yes, those log entries should be from me at the IP where I can see the failures.

[21:15] <raydiak> What disturbs me is if I were attempting a failed man in the middle attack against a TLS connection, this is exactly the kind of weirdness I'd expect to see. I blame the NSA here in the USA. Which is more of a conspiracy theory than a plausable explanation

[21:15] <japhb> Paranoia speaking here ... but maybe an incompetent MITM attack, such as a TLS/SSL version downgrade that fails?

[21:15] <japhb> Heh, perfect timing.

[21:15] <raydiak> heh, glad to know it's not just me looking at that :)

[21:16] * rba is looking into wireshare, yet not able to understand what is going wrong...

[21:17] <rba> s/wireshare/wireshark/

[21:17] <raydiak> wireshark is a wonderful thing, whether for education or security

[21:17] <rba> raydiak: btw offering TLSv1.3 now and it's used by your browser

[21:20] <raydiak> ah, that's right. tls 1.3 is the new thing, isn't it?

[21:21] <raydiak> the capture looks weird...like things are doubled...and you see several ClientHellos....

[21:22] <rba> raydiak: Just added 30/40 minutes ago...

[21:22] <raydiak> it still fails. still looking at this capture, trying to figure it out

[21:30] <raydiak> this is very bizarre. you are receiving multiple clienthellos, like repeated attempts or something. I only send one, by my captures. I'm seriously starting to think something is working its own agenda in between

[21:31] <rba> raydiak: this are two tcp connections from your side

[21:34] <raydiak> rba: okay, I see. two separate ports, my wireshark filter was too tight. why is chromium doing that, I wonder

[21:38] <raydiak> rba: want to capture the exact same communication on both ends? I'll set mine up to monitor again, let me know when you're ready again on your end

[21:38] <rba> raydiak: go

[21:39] <raydiak> I'll do curl this time so there's no weirdness. here we go...

[21:39] <raydiak> done

[21:45] <raydiak> erm...

[21:45] <raydiak> rba: http://data.cyberuniverses.com/stuff/rakudoc.pcapng

[21:46] <rba> raydiak: even serverhello is missing. hmmm

[21:47] <rba> raydiak: looks like some data is lost on the way...

[21:50] <raydiak> rba: agreed. we both see valid clienthello, but then everything diverges. You send an ack, and I receive some garbage and then an ack, and everything's wrong after that until the rst that ends the conversation

[21:52] <rba> raydiak: Can you test from another place in US? Like webhost?

[21:52] <raydiak> rba: attach both of these to an issue to your hosting provider, is all I can figure. if you don't have some crazy firewall rules gone wrong or something, and I know I don't, then I'm at a loss

[21:52] <raydiak> rba: yes I can hit it from my server, but it works there instead of failing. is that what you want to see?

[21:52] <rba> I would guess it's something with comcast?

[21:53] <rba> nine is our webhosting provider :-)

[21:53] <raydiak> we can't rule comcast out, but the rest of the internet works fine from here

[21:53] <codesections> yeah, I was going to say comcast as well.  Unfortunately, monopolies being what they are, that's a big chunk of US users

[21:53] <raydiak> oh good, I needed to ask nine++ some Inline:: questions anyway :)

[21:55] <raydiak> no kidding. not much for other options in this state, unfortunately. I had better service in Texas. but is the other guy who reported this problem also on comcast?

[21:55] <rba> raydiak: unfortunately complains so fare are only from US side...

[21:55] <rba> raydiak: I have tried to send some pvt messages to ask them for more details, yet haven't reached them yet.

[21:57] <raydiak> rba: I recall you mentioning that. I'm very curious as to the geographic correlation, given that we supposedly have free and unmangled access to the whole internet here. no great firewall or nannystate or what have you

[21:57] <rba> raydiak: Froogal had issues last week, and tbrowder reported some earlier, yet now seems to be fine.

[21:58] <rba> I will let the "info" level on the nginx error log and have a look during the week. This shows the ssl error codes. And maybe I got some more feedback.

[21:58] <codesections> here's the chat of when this came up before. https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku?date=2021-03-10#l277  tbrowder said their ISP is cox cable 

[21:59] * rba is not sure if this are all the same problems...

[21:59] <codesections> good point

[22:00] <raydiak> ah. cox is an entirely separate provider from comcast. we used to have cox cable tv where I am many many years ago, before they offered internet, but then they got replaced by comcast here

[22:00] <rba> Anyway, don't hesitate to report the issues. I will collect all of them and see what I can do.

[22:02] <tbrowder> rba: cox cable here in nw florida, destin are, i just went to the site and got white page with no css apparently

[22:03] <rba> 2021/03/14 22:02:36 [info] 4633#4633: *3067 peer closed connection in SSL handshake (104: Connection reset by peer) while SSL handshaking, client: 70.191.216.57, server: 0.0.0.0:443

[22:03] <rba> tbrowder: this might be your ip?

[22:03] <tbrowder> docs home page, then clicking on any link gives me the tls error

[22:03] <raydiak> rba: the matching (but not matching) packet captures are the best data we have so far. file that with youre provider? failing that, I would be willing to try to contact comcast, but they're a very large and difficult to work with company. I'll have to spend hours explaining it to service reps talking a script over and over to eventually get escalated to anybody who even understands what a packet is, probably

[22:03] <raydiak> just for them to say "not our fault, good luck"

[22:05] <tbrowder> yes, that's my ip

[22:07] <rba> Same with https://docs.rakulang.site/ ?

[22:07] <tbrowder> that site shows well, no probs

[22:08] <rba> tbrowder: This is so crazy. As it's on the same server, same nginx, even same certificate and same config part.

[22:09] <rba> Is there some "transparent caching proxy" somewhere in between?

[22:09] <tbrowder> both have no mixed http/https?

[22:11] <rba> tbrowder: there is no rocket science. https://gist.github.com/rba/c11feff2a67fe3d74bf170e32ba036dc

[22:13] <tbrowder> why are you listening on 80

[22:14] <rba> tbrowder: to redirect to https

[22:14] <tbrowder> i think you need to reject http, forget listening on 80

[22:15] <tbrowder> i think that's part of the problem

[22:16] <rba> tbrowder: I don't understand, why you think this is part of the problem. Yet, let me comment it quicky and you try again...

[22:17] <tbrowder> i'm certainly no expert, but i have my servers non-80 because of racommendations i've seen from qualys and such places

[22:17] <rba> tbrowder: please try again.

[22:17] <tbrowder> chrome and firefox are really picky now

[22:18] <rba> tbrowder: log looks not better now... :-(

[22:18] <tbrowder> let me clear cache

[22:20] <tbrowder> no go, guess that makes no diff

[22:20] <tbrowder> sorry

[22:21] <raydiak> nothing different here. and it still doesn't explain why it works except for some people in the US

[22:21] <tbrowder> can you try reversing order of server names?

[22:22] <parabolize> it seems to be working for me through comcast

[22:23] <rba> tbrowder: reversed and restarted, try again.

[22:23] <raydiak> parabolize: just as a datapoint, approximately where are you?

[22:23] <raydiak> rba: no effect here

[22:24] <tbrowder>  no diff, weird!

[22:24] <rba> I think some packages are lost on the way between *some* people in US and the hosting server in austria.

[22:24] <parabolize> raydiak: colorado

[22:24] <raydiak> where are you, tbrowder?

[22:25] <tbrowder> niceville, florida, near destin

[22:25] <raydiak> wow...I'm in the opposite corner, WA state

[22:25] <rba> reverted the hostname order and enabled port 80 again in nginx config 

[22:25] <raydiak> broken in WA and FL, but not broken in CO and CA

[22:28] <raydiak> and broken for one comcast user and not the other, but broken for a cox user also. don't know who/what my server in CA gets its connectivity through, it's a digitalocean server and the docs site is not broken from there

[22:29] <tbrowder> ok, at least the other adddress works. how about yr cert, wild card or?

[22:29] <raydiak> it's a non-wildcard multi-domain cert

[22:30] * rba is giving up for today.

[22:31] <tbrowder> hm, have you tried separate certs for each domain? that's what i do

[22:31] *** epony left
[22:31] <raydiak> in chorme at least, you can see the details from the lock icon on the left of the address bar. multi-domain is under certificate->extensions->certificate subject alternate name

[22:33] <rba> btw raku.org/rakudo.org is on the same server. any issues there?

[22:33] <raydiak> tbrowder: that's the only difference I've noticed so far, but it really should work. even if you establish a valid connection at docs.rakusite.lang, in chrome the persistent connection to the server will work for docs.raku.org until it times out. the handshake only fails on that one domain, but everything else works except for the handshake

[22:34] <raydiak> both work from here

[22:35] <rba> sorry, nosense. both are behind CDN proxies from cloudflare.

[22:35] <raydiak> yes they both show as cloudflare certs, unlike the docs cert

[22:35] <tbrowder> i'll try some more debugging here later (on a real computer). thanks for your help, rba

[22:36] <tbrowder> as long as i can see the other site all is well

[22:37] <rba> For docs.raku.org I have enabled Cloudeflare CDN again. Should be active in a few minutes. Yet we had the problems with enabled CDN already last week. So I don't know...

[22:37] <tbrowder> from my house

[22:39] <raydiak> rba: those two both have sni.cloudflaressl.com as a cert SAN, but the docs cert does not...only SANs are docs.raku.org and docs.rakusite.lang

[22:41] <rba> Cloudflare can be used as "DNS only" or "Proxied". Last week I have changed docs.raku.org from "Proxied" to "DNS only". docs.rakulang.site is always on "DNS only". 

[22:41] <rba> And a few seconds ago I have changed docs.raku.org back to "Proxied". Let's see if this changes something.

[22:44] <raydiak> I recall you changing that a few days agoi. It did nothing for the issue I've been observing all year. That's why I'm so mystified. There shouldn't be anything causing the problem, and your own packet captures show you senting a valid ServerHello, which I never receive. THe problem is in between, I suspect.
