[00:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e457595a: OUTPUT: ¬´(1 33)‚ê§¬ª
[00:37] <moon-child> ideally you would be able to say '3/99 .nude'.  It works for negatives and complex numbers, but not fractions apparently
[00:38] <[Coke]> heh. I literally had that typed out and was going to send it. :)

[01:27] <japhb> Well, so much for that idea
[01:28] <moon-child> if you find angle brackets more to your liking than parenthesis, you can do
[01:28] <moon-child> m: say <3/99>.nude

[04:46] <mcmillhj> A bit confused about set operations, specifically inequality. In this gist, why is `$last` `(Any)`: https://gist.github.com/mcmillhj/a54ea1515cab011b3000e8ae81218f74
[04:48] <moon-child> != is numeric inequality, which I expect is not what you want
[04:50] <mcmillhj> Both inputs are Sets so I thought it would use the Set inequality operator. It there some way that I need to indicate that I want that operator used?
[04:51] <moon-child> !(==) is the set inequality operator
[04:52] <moon-child> (or, really it is (==) that is the set equality operator, to which the ! metaoperator can be applied.  But, potato potato)
[04:53] <mcmillhj> ah whoops, I was misreading ‚â¢ in the docs as != ... That's my mistake. Thanks for the help!

[08:09] <moritz_> I've answered on SO, hope it helps
[08:11] <Ergo444> I added more information
[08:11] <Ergo444> It is not that simple.
[08:11] <Ergo444> The program keeps running, doing stuff
[08:12] <Ergo444> The full output is printed when the program ends.. with a considerable delay.
[08:12] *** jjido joined
[08:18] <Ergo444> I think it buffers the output.....for a while before printing
[08:18] <Ergo444> how to make it print more often?
[08:19] <moritz_> see my updated answer
[08:21] <Ergo444> ok
[08:22] <Ergo444> but if I run the program in itself... it does not delay that much.

[15:49] <ab5tract> Ergo444: IIRC you need to have Perl compiled with support for having more than one interpreter in memory
[15:49] <ab5tract> I forget the specific flag
[15:52] <El_Che> -Dusethreads
[15:54] <ab5tract> El_Che: I think it is actually separate from that flag, though the use of -Dusethreads implies/enforces the flag I'm thinking of.

[16:22] <lizmat> the reason that .push doesn't have single arg semantics
