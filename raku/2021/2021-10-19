[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Petr#9247> where i can find simple   tutorial  about modules?
[12:31] <perryprog> Petr, https://docs.raku.org/language/modules is probably what you want

[12:33] <xinming_> In this case, Can we make the -2 unsigned int?
[12:33] <xinming_> What I mean is something like, bitwise not on a char, and get the integer for that char

[17:23] <lizmat> tonyo: re prefix ~^  I think it's more bikeshedding on the exact semantics?
[17:26] <tonyo> yes but if someone just does the work and submits it they're more likely to have it than if they just comment somewhere about it while no one does the work

[18:40] <perryprog> "Learn Raku with balls" I can't be the only one who read that as that
[18:42] <perryprog> Whoa, lizmat, this is the two year anniversary of rakudo weekly?! :O
[18:43] <lizmat> indeed it is  :-)
[18:43] <pony> heh, I like the reddit about what grammars are
[18:43] <lizmat> my first weekly was in January 2015 though, so I've been at it a bit longer already
[18:44] <perryprog> That's amazing. Congratulations, and thank you for your always-wonderful posts. I've said it before, but I want to say it again: Rakudo weekly is one of the number one reasons I have always enjoyed Raku outside of the language itself.
[18:44] <lizmat> thank you for your kind words :-)
[18:44] <perryprog> It's a real shame that not many other new and developing languages have something similar. (LOOKING AT YOU, JULIA!)
[18:45] <gfldex> We put all lazyness into the language so there is nothing left for ourselves.
[18:45] <lizmat> gfldex: there's that  :-)
[18:46] <perryprog> Speaking of nice things, this log site looks seriously nice.

[18:46] <gfldex> Blogging is a lot of work. My posts are quite short and it's still a few hours per post.
[18:47] <lizmat> perryprog: again, thank you, still needs some tweaks, but we're getting there
[18:47] <perryprog> gfldex: not to mention having live links referencing everything for further details...

[23:31] <guifa> but you'd need to set it outside, I don't believe there's a way to access it wholely within the gather block

[23:47] <guifa> BTW, if you're going to do a fib style (peaking back at X elements), you could just use the sequence generator instead
