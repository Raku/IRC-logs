[00:15] <Xliff> guifa: It's not

[00:15] <Xliff> I haven't changed $*TZ at all.

[00:16] <Xliff> raku -e '$*TZ.say' # -14400

[00:18] <guifa> Sorry, I mean, it uses $*TZ for the local timezone value.  Not that it uses $*TZ for creating using .new (it does for .now, though)

[00:20] <guifa> dependingo n prefs, this may look cleaner in your code

[00:20] <guifa> m: say DateTime.new(1).in-timezone: $*TZ

[04:29] <guifa> Xliff++ for finding that "Passed bad arguments..." error.  I had somehow back in the day assumed someone would only use an Int, but actually any old Numeric is sufficient for creating a DateTime

[04:30] <guifa> and HALLELUJAH! new-dispatch FINALLY lets DateTime::Timezones work how I had previously intended it to!

[04:35] <guifa> (previously, precomp-smthng-smthng-i-forget-the-exact-details was causing Intl::Format::DateTIme to not be able to include DT:Timezones and the latter could never be used in a file that would be precompiled.  But on the new-dispatch, that's not the case!)

[05:46] <japhb> CBOR::Simple 0.1.0 released/uploaded -- contains all the low-hanging fruit improvements I found while I read All The Specs looking to see if something like Capture is already supported.  Looks like no, which means I'll need to use a temporary tag number while I create a spec for it

[05:47] <japhb> xinming: CBOR work continues, but native support for Capture will require temporary tagging, plus a spec to get a permanent tag number

[18:21] <melezhik> Hi! I am thinking about building a new service built on top of cro, one thing might stop me from using cro, is oath support, does cro have the one?

[18:21] <melezhik> I need oath authentication for GH users specifically ...

[18:22] <Xliff> melezhik - Couldn't you use another module to implement OAuth inside Cro?

[18:23] <melezhik> yeah, it's doable, I just think maybe there is exiting solution ... but probably will consider implementing myself

[18:23] <Xliff> Not finding a generic OAuth module in the ecosystem, however.

[18:24] <Xliff> There's plenty available for Perl. You might want to consider Inline::Perl5

[20:28] <sjn> I've taken the liberty to create a #rakulang channel on the TPF slack, for those of us who care to interact with YAS/TPF/TRF :-) https://join.slack.com/share/zt-vjwsz56u-LI~JrIpXhVkT4vUz6mqX5g

[20:29] <sjn> (link valid for another two weeks, from now)

[20:39] <unixcat64> what is the plural for members of the Raku community? like Rust has "rustaceans", Go has "gophers"

[20:41] <Altai-man> unixcat64, rakoons maybe.

[20:53] <unixcat64> it would have to be something related to Camelia

[20:59] <moritz_> it used to be lambdacamels

[20:59] <moritz_> back when Audrey was bringing in all the Haskell programmers

[21:15] <moon-child> I prefer 'camel curry'

[21:18] <japhb> You can always tell when new Haskell programmers join the channel, because they ask questions I hadn't even found a need for yet.  :-)

[21:45] <tbrowder> hi, zef question, please: if i remove the .zef directory, will i have to reinstall all the modules? (i know early on i was told to remove .zef to help some zef problem, but i don't remember the result.)

[21:46] <ugexe> no

[21:46] <ugexe> `zef nuke site` is generally how you delete all your installed modules

[21:47] <ugexe> you should pretty much never be afraid to delete ~/.zef at any time for any reason
