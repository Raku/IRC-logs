[06:36] <moon-child> is there a version of first that returns an index instead of an element?

[06:36] <moon-child> (actually, better yet, is there a version of first that returns everything after and including the matched element, instead of just the element in question?)

[11:17] <lizmat> I think it only handles CPAN uploaded modules ?

[11:17] <lizmat> and maybe modules on fez ?

[11:17] <lucs> In particular, I'm wondering why Template::Mojo appears to be missing.

[13:32] <masak> QhpAptyj9hj0RQwM: wow, nice! I'd recommend checking against what happened the last time an operator was added, in commit ca97ce.

[13:33] <masak> documentation updated, Builtins.pm6, and operators.t -- that's basically it

[13:34] <El_Che> .pm6? You're old, man :)

[13:34] <masak> stipulated.

[13:34] <masak> there was an even earlier time when those files were just called .pm

[13:34] <El_Che> :)

[13:35] <masak> I remember being very cagey about putting sixes in the file names; to me it was just Perl module files

[13:35] <masak> a decidedly gauche opinion these days... :)

[13:35] <El_Che> people were burnt for less in the past

[13:36] <lizmat> sadly, the crowds with stakes have decreased in numbers  :-(

[13:36] <masak> well, I'm still here, old-fashioned opinions and all

[13:37] <masak> I ask forgiveness for my rusty habits

[13:37] <lizmat> you old man, you!  :-)

[13:38] <masak> actually, I felt even in 2012 or so that I was an "old" Perl 6 user, because I had some habits from around 2008 that were really hard to shake

[13:39] <El_Che> It sounds like when I tell stories about the 90s internet to young colleagues :)

[13:39] <masak> newer users would just (I felt) swoop in and express things really succinctly sometimes, but I didn't really think of those simpler ways, because they used to be not implemented yet :P
