[02:13] <moon-child> Callable[Str] is the type of a callable returning Str.  How can I express the types of the parameters in the type?

[02:21] <elcaro> I'm not sure you can. a Callable symbol could be a multi, so I think the best you can do is (iterate through .cadidates if necessary and) inspect .signature

[09:26] <gfldex> leont: ^^^ at the time `does Foo[$a]` is evaluated the container `$a` is Mu. The `$a` in Bar[Int $a] is a different container.

[09:29] <leont> So "inheriting" the argument across roles doesn't work at all?

[18:02] <SmokeMachine> I have 2 small suggestion about that, if you don’t mind: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core/blob/main/lib/MUGS/Server/Storage/Driver/Red/SQLite.rakumod#L40 you could use `schema(@models).create` and for everything else you can use `red-do :transaction, { … }` for transactions

[19:57] <leont> Getting this error when compiling rakudo on a fresh checkout: «While looking for 'CORE.c.setting.moarvm': no such file or directory»

[19:57] <leont> Anyone got a clue what could be going on?

[19:58] <moritz_> leont: the last time somebody had this error, it was an OOM in an earlier compilation stage

[19:59] <leont> moritz_: Thanks, I'm pretty sure that's exactly it (this VPS has 512M ram apparently, not sure how I'm going to get rakudo on it)

[20:00] <tyil> I've had success with 1 gb memory raspi over a year ago, but not with VMs that had less

[20:02] <moritz_> leont: compile somewhere else, compile it over?

[21:10] <Xliff> \o

[21:10] <Xliff> Is there a Raku-approved way to take a void* from a CLib and hand it off to a Buf for management without an implicit copy?

[21:11] <summerisle_> I think that if you just say 'Buf' in a native sig, nativecall assumes you mean Pointer[Void] as far as calling convention goes.

[21:12] <Xliff> summerisle_: Yeah, I've had bad luck with using Buf in NativeCall sigs. Usually results in a SegV.

[21:12] <summerisle_> hmm, i need to re-ident but i was doing a ton of stuff with nativecall and buffers that was going well

[21:12] <Xliff> I have prior experience. Heh

[21:13] *** summerisle_ left
[21:13] *** summerisle joined
[21:14] <summerisle> so what are you doing Xliff

[21:15] <summerisle> iirc i was doing some stuff with binary data in buffers and passing them around nativecall

[21:16] <Xliff> libical bindings

[21:16] <Xliff> Particularly https://libical.github.io/libical/apidocs/icalmemory_8h_source.html

[21:36] <leont> My supply { whenever { ... } } is closing down without me asking for it. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong

[21:50] *** guifa2 joined
[21:57] <summerisle> Xliff: and nativecast() won't do the trick?

[22:05] <summerisle> i suppose you could always abuse memcpy

[22:06] <Xliff> Already there. :)

[22:06] <Xliff> summerisle: Will have to try nativecast.

[22:06] <Xliff> Still would like a way to tell Buf what its size is, which we currenly cannot do.

[22:07] *** guifa2 left
[22:30] *** wamba left
[22:34] <leont> Also, a CLOSE on another supply is running twice. I can't quite explain that either
