[00:59] <bda> Grammar action question - if I have a token that is just an or list of other tokens, how do I define an action method which just uses the .made of the sub-token?
[01:18] <pony> $<sub-token>.map(*.made) (I think)
[01:20] <pony> or rather, make $<sub-token>.map(*.made)
[01:25] <bda> so for "token type { | <fp> | <integer> | <complex> }", what is "method type($/) {}"? Because subtoken could be one of three things, and maybe more later
[01:25] <japhb> tbrowder: Not yet.  More work to do on RakuAST before it would be ready to merge.  It *has* been rebased on top of post-new-disp-merge main, though.

[05:16] <mfiano> I noticed there are only two Raku books published since the name was changed, and neither seem to be a beginner walkthrough book that most languages have available. I am guessing one of the slightly older books on "Perl 6" would be more appropriate, but given the time span Perl 6 has been a thing, I'm not sure which book would be the best for me to look into buying. Anyone have any ideas?

[06:12] <mfiano> I am looking for something less of a analyzation of the language, and more of a walkthrough
[06:15] <pony> how can I split a string like '((((abc))))((((abc))))' into '((((', 'abc', '))))', '((((', 'abc', '))))'?
[06:19] <moritz_> mfiano: maybe Perl 6 Deep Dive is better suited for you then
[06:21] <moon-child> pony: .match(/('('+|')'+|\w+)*/).values.map(&[~]) will do it.  But it's not clear exactly what you want; you should explain more clearly

[16:04] <dogbert17> hello leont, can I ask a question?
[16:04] <leont> You already did :-p
[16:04] <dogbert17> :)
[16:05] <dogbert17> I'm probably doing something incorrectly but trying to run 'make test HARNESS_TYPE=6' fails with an error for me

[16:08] <leont> Then it seems something bitrotted, I'll have a look
[16:09] <dogbert17> thx, do you want me to report it as an issue in the TAP/Harness repo?
[16:14] <leont> It rather sounds like the issue is in the rakudo repo
[16:16] <[Coke]> anyone know if there's a repo for the "raku ci bot grant" ?
[16:16] <[Coke]> (or is it not that kind of grant)
[16:18] <leont> dogbert17: actually, I think you found a regression in rakudo itself
[16:19] <leont> ./rakudo-m -e 'dd $_ for  "t".IO.dir(:test(none($*SPEC.updir, $*SPEC.curdir, ".git")))'
[16:19] <leont> That returns a junction of sequences, instead of a sequence
[16:21] <leont> I'm guessing Rakudo::Iterator::Dir takes an Any instead of a Mu as argument. That would result in exactly what we're seeing here
[16:25] *** euandreh joined
[16:25] <lizmat> should it take a Mu ?

[18:32] <melezhik> i wonder if Raku people are interested in adding Raku projects and reviews them on https://mybf.io ? I am testing this idea. I see it like yet another resource to spread a knowledge about Raku and show  other - it's real usage
[18:33] <melezhik> I've made reviews for some of chosen modules recently just to show how it could look like 
[18:34] <melezhik> the benefit is mybfi.io site is not only for Raku, so other people visiting it might start paying attention .... just a thought ... maybe not a perfect idea ...
[18:36] <lizmat> melezhik: it always takes time before there's a critical mass  :-)
[18:37] <melezhik> yeah, I know, I know ))) I even ready for the idea to wrap the project up if it does go very well, but let's see
[18:38] <melezhik> I am still in research - whether it is a good idea or not to allow people publicly review open source software, in the end of they day we have GH issues for that )))
[18:39] <melezhik> however this is something different -  just to allow people quickly share there thought on certain piece of software not necessarily tide to any particular issue or feature
[18:40] <melezhik> the advantage is quick feedback for a software author as well as to help people make better choices before start using tool A or tool B
[18:40] <melezhik> and I know there is a reddit for that, but sometimes reddit is  a bit too biased, on my view at least ...
[18:41] <[Coke]> It seems a reasonable idea, but the fact that it's separated from the package management system (right?) of the various languages' modules makes it ad hoc, yes?
[18:43] <melezhik> lizmat sorry for that typo " to wrap the project up if it does go very well" -> " to wrap the project up if it does NOT go very well,"
[18:43] <lizmat> melezhik: yeah, figured that  :-)
[18:44] <melezhik> yeah )))
[18:54] <colemanx> I often find myself just searching github - exclusively - when I need a library; i'd like alternatives and other aggregators across the different software forges
[18:54] <melezhik> colemanx ++

[18:57] <colemanx> I might suggest renaming the category "infrastructure as a code" to simly "Infrastructure as Code"
[18:57] <colemanx> or even IaC, which is a common abbreviation
[19:03] <melezhik> colemanx - thanks, I changed to a "infrastructure as code"

[19:59] <El_Che> for
[20:00] <melezhik> ok, I see ... Many people still don't see the difference )))
[20:00] <El_Che> nowdays I mostly write Go and Raku when possible
[20:00] <melezhik> oh, cool
[20:00] <melezhik> I made some reviews for go tools on mybfio recently ...
[20:01] <melezhik> I even run a golang contest, sorry for the off topic ))) 
[20:01] <melezhik> honestly after Perl and Raku, every time I try to write something on go, I struggle with it's syntax
[20:02] <El_Che> go is a great complement for Raku: they are so far apart that it's easy to step in a different mindset when writing in the other language
[20:02] <melezhik> I know one binary and stuff it is all cool
[20:02] <melezhik> but the syntax, maybe I am just not used to that ...
[20:02] <El_Che> Syntax is clean and easy to master once you're used to it
[20:02] <melezhik> yeah , they are a far for sure ...
[20:03] <melezhik> yeah , they are a far for sure ...
[20:03] <El_Che> but for lots of stuff you need to write extra code
[20:03] <melezhik> I mean not syntax itself, but kinda feeling - it's minimalism ...
[20:03] <El_Che> in contrast with raku's stdlib
[20:03] <melezhik> that bothers me ...
[20:03] <El_Che> (on the other hand, they have lots of libs)

[20:05] <El_Che> melezhik: I did some java in the past, but I can stomach writing it nowadays
[20:05] <El_Che> melezhik: you end up having a lot of ready code after a while
[20:06] <melezhik> yes you do and you master the language itself, but I don't know ... my recent mindset I am a bit tired of mastering things, I just want to use them )))
[20:06] <El_Che> but I agree that for stuff like "is this element part of this array" is completely silly to write a loop every time
[20:06] <melezhik> here we are )))
[20:06] <El_Che> and wat kills me, is that you need one for each type
[20:06] <El_Che> (they are working on the generics though)
[20:07] <melezhik> yeah, that's a drawback of static typed languages I guess? I am not too sure though ...
[20:07] <El_Che> with the risks of making the code less readable (that's why many oppose the planned inclusion of generics in 2.0)
[20:07] <El_Che> melezhik: no, java and c# have generics
[20:08] <El_Che> go also has generics in the internal library
[20:08] <El_Che> but not exposed for the user
[20:08] <melezhik> ok ... I probably know what generic are . I mean the thing people try to solve using generic, We don't have them in dynamically typed languages, huh?
[20:08] <El_Che> it was a choice to keep the language simple
