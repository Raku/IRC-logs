[10:02] <tyil> lizmat: nice presentation :>

[10:02] <lizmat> thank you  :-)

[10:02] <lizmat> I can also answer questions here, if people have any

[10:03] <tyil> I think most people will congregate on the matrix channel, but it's quite laggy

[10:03] <tyil> the last message I saw on the irc side of things took 14 minutes to arrive from the matrix side of things :/

[10:04] <lizmat> wow

[10:06] <tyil> oh no, it's getting worse :(

[10:07] <tyil> welp, I don't have time to be upset about it

[10:08] <tyil> I hope to be able to watch some vids of this on youtube soon-ish, there's a lot of interesting stuff on the fosdem planning

[10:30] <lizmat> El_Che o/

[10:30] <El_Che> was only able to watch the end of the talk, but it look/sounded good

[10:30] <El_Che> hopefully I'll catch the rest with the recording

[10:31] <lizmat> yeah, if FOSDEM manages to lose it, I still have a copy :-)

[10:32] <El_Che> good thinking

[10:33] <El_Che> saw you on the mattermost channel

[10:33] <El_Che> lots of sports :)

[10:33] <lizmat> ?

[10:33] <El_Che> you look very fit

[10:34] <lizmat> ah, ok, well... yes, I think I lost about 25kg since last fosdem

[10:34] <lizmat> already cycled ~670 km this year

[10:35] <El_Che> \o/

[11:10] * jmerelo clickbaits https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#perl:fosdem.org for the perl and raku devroom

[11:10] <tellable6> 2021-02-05T14:39:02Z #raku <tonyo> jmerelo: lisp is pretty simple and easy to implement

[11:10] <jmerelo> From the comfortability of your own place (or wherever)

[11:33] <El_Che> someone today to me:

[11:34] <El_Che> "you spent all this energy explaining to us that Raku and Perl were different languages and the Fosdem put you in the same room!? "

[11:36] <jmerelo> El_Che: you probably missed it, but it will be recorded

[11:37] <jmerelo> El_Che: I mentioned your organization of the devroom, along with Wendy, up to now, and how grateful we were with that

[11:37] <jmerelo> El_Che: WRT to what you just said... Meh. There are devrooms for many, or no language

[11:38] <El_Che>  it sets my PR efforts to -10 irl

[11:38] <El_Che> but better a mixed room than none, that's for sure

[11:39] <jmerelo> El_Che: why? I really can't see why

[11:39] <El_Che> because Perl PR is kind of a lost battle ATM

[11:39] <El_Che> maybe perl 7 will change it, but now it's sad

[11:39] <lizmat> FWIW, I would be in favour of having separated rooms

[11:39] <El_Che> perl 6 was pulled down by that

[11:40] <El_Che> I *love* and support what Ovid and Leonerd try to do to modernize Perl

[11:40] <El_Che> but we are talking about base OO systems, try catch and signature

[11:41] *** aborazmeh left
[11:41] <El_Che> poeple are not triggered by that

[11:42] <El_Che> and there is a risk that p7 will be the p6/pythom3 story over again

[11:42] <El_Che> you don't want to be in the blast zone if that happens

[12:19] <ab5tract> o/ all! 

[12:20] <ab5tract> been a good while since I've logged on, hope everyone is doing ok these days

[12:20] <El_Che> hi ab5tract!

[12:22] <ab5tract> hey El_Che :)

[12:30] <ab5tract> anyone here running Comma on Linux with rakubrew? I'm having trouble getting the IDE to recognize the validity of rakubrew's raku as an SDK

[12:33] *** ab5tract left
[12:34] *** ab5tract joined
[12:36] <ab5tract> hmm, it only seems to be an issue based on launching via my custom .desktop file versus launching from the command line :/

[12:36] <El_Che> ab5tract: I run comma as a plugin for intellij with rakudo-pkg

[12:43] *** jmerelo left
[12:48] <ab5tract> El_Che, interesting.. I have never heard of rakudo-pkg

[13:00] <ab5tract> El_Che, thanks for the hint! rakudo-pkg is awesome :O

[13:02] <El_Che> ab5tract: I am in the process in moving to Github action and putting the repos in CloudSmith (bintray will close down in may)

[13:04] <ab5tract> Considering how crappy the experience of trying to get a recent nodejs installed was, I think rakudo-pkg is quite a contribution to the Raku ecosystem

[14:25] <ab5tract> one thing that confuses me about Comma: when creating a new project, it seems impossible to create a namespaced module (ie, Grammar::Foo). Or am I holding it wrong?

[14:27] <guifa2> ab5tract: I've had a bit of trouble with that myself at times.  WHen you go to File --> New Project, and choose module, IIRC it's the *first* part where you name the module that you use the colons.  Everywhere else, avoid colons and the project should start out okay even though it might not be clear from the dialogs

[14:28] <guifa2> But I've definitely had to manually make the namespace a few times so I feel your pain :-)

[14:29] <ab5tract> guifa2, that's the ticket! Never managed to ignore the issues in the next dialog before :)

[14:34] *** wamba joined
[14:40] <El_Che> I mever encoutered because I mostly create the repo first and clone it through the cli
