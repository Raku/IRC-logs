[00:00] <japhb> (While TinyFloats also supports *EN*coding, I'm not using that in CBOR::Simple yet, because it would probably slow encoding num arrays quite a bit.  Correctly encoding binary16 is non-trivial.  :-/  )

[00:28] <japhb> moon-child: Windows defaults NaN's representation to the opposite sign bit as everyone else, but the sign bit for NaN is explictly supposed to be ignored, so I just squash it to be the same everywhere to get byte-equivalent encodings everywhere.

[10:48] <lizmat> .gist is a HLL concept

[10:48] <Xliff> Best way to output an array, then?

[10:48] <lizmat> if it is a nqp::list, use dd

[10:51] <Xliff> gfldex: Nice article. Still made my head hurt.

[10:52] <Xliff> Are you saying that... in this case, since NotNil is Nil's child, Nil's .new will always override?

[10:53] <Xliff> m: class NotNil is Nil {}; say NotNil.new.^name

[10:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3638d2240: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[10:53] <Xliff> Ouch. Is there any way to know ahead of time which classes will cause this behavior?

[10:54] * Xliff makes mental note to never subclass Nil.

[10:54] <Xliff> m: class NotNil is Nil { method new { self.CREATE }; }; say NotNil.new.^name

[10:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3638d2240: OUTPUT: «NotNil␤»

[10:54] <Xliff> That time not-so-much.

[18:30] <Xliff> dakkar: ^^ That, but in a way that will work for different environments.

[18:30] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to dakkar

[18:31] <Xliff> Unfortunately, I think this may be another one of those things that has to be compiled into a helper lib because macros are not accessible by NativeCall without cheats.

[18:32] <tonyo> what are you doing that you want to modify the user's environment?
