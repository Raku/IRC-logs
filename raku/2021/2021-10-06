[03:07] <tellable6> 2021-10-05T09:27:03Z #moarvm <jnthnwrthngtn> vrurg It's about separate compilation; the compilation of a module should start with an empty GLOBAL and accumulate the things that are `use`d by it.

[08:26] <CIAvash> moon-child: I wanted to do something similar in the same unit, but it didn't work, the only option I found is `.wrap`: `&m1::f.wrap: sub (|c) { given c { when :(Num) { say 'num' }; default { callsame } } }`

[13:38] <ggoebel> Any pointers on how one specifies a dependency on a Perl5 module in the META6.json?
[13:40] <nine> ggoebel: :from<Perl5>
[13:40] <nine> or in the long hash form: 'from': 'Perl5'
[13:42] <ggoebel> so... "depends": ["Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX:from<Perl5>"] ...?
[13:42] <nine> yes
[13:45] <nine> it's poasible that only one form is implemented. can't check now as I'm only on a phone
[13:46] <ggoebel> that is strangely consistent :-) didn't expect that to work. will give it a try
[13:46] <ggoebel> hmm... zef install Inline::Perl5
[13:46] <ggoebel> ===> Searching for: Inline::Perl5
[13:46] <ggoebel> ===> Searching for missing dependencies: perl:from<native>
[13:46] <ggoebel> No such method 'as' for invocant of type 'Any'
[13:47] <nine> I really need to remove that dependency as distros don't pit libperl.so in the library path
[13:47] <nine> it's safe to ignore the error via zef command line switch
[13:47] <ggoebel> thx
[13:50] <ggoebel> zef --force install Inline::Perl5 gives the same output. i.e. never gets to ===> Installing
[13:51] <ggoebel> getting further with zef --/depends --/test --force install Inline::Perl5
[13:52] <ggoebel> installed :-)

[14:34] <immediate> hi, why is the new operator not taking precedence: 
[14:35] <immediate> m: sub infix:<^> is equiv(&infix:<**>) { $^a ** $^b };         say 5 * 4 ^ 3
[14:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 569f90eae: OUTPUT: ¬´8000‚ê§¬ª
[14:35] <immediate> expecting 320
[14:36] <moritz_> m: say 4 ^ 3
[14:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 569f90eae: OUTPUT: ¬´one(4, 3)‚ê§¬ª
[14:37] <moritz_> immediate: the problem is that there already *is* an infix:<^>, and raku cannot retroactively change the precedence of an operator
[14:37] <moritz_> one could argue that this should raise an error though
[14:37] <moritz_> (I believe I have argued that in the past)
[14:37] <immediate> oh, sorry, thanks...

[14:41] <Petr> Nice day )) Anybody can help me? Can i convert html to docx &
[14:41] <lizmat> immediate: the problem is that your candidate did not have 2 params
[14:42] <immediate> lizmat: didn't it? With $^a and $^b?
[14:42] <immediate> and it gave a result 8000 back as (5 * 4) ^ 3
[14:43] <Petr> I cant find any solution for this...
[14:44] <[Coke]> Petr: I don't think raku has any interop with the latest office standard. You might find a solution in perl (that you could then use from Raku)
[14:44] <[Coke]> If it's a one off.. you should be able to cut and paste it in.)
[14:45] <Petr> What about ODT?
[14:45] <MasterDuke> i think tbrowder was working on some modules for office docs
[14:46] <MasterDuke> and i think jnthn made a module to work with xls
[14:47] <lizmat> immediate: ah, yes...  :-)
[14:47] <lizmat> m: sub infix:<^> is equiv(&infix:<**>) { $^a, $^b; "foo" }; say 4^5
[14:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 569f90eae: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª
[14:48] <lizmat> so, I'm not sure why that didn't work for you, immediate 
[14:48] <[Coke]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4226095/html-to-doc-converter-in-python/4227062#4227062 - a python example of using the word itself to do the conversion.
[14:48] <Petr> thanks
[14:48] <lizmat> aaah... it's about precedence
[14:48] * lizmat goes back to working on the weekly  :-)
[14:49] <Petr> i hate python )))
[14:50] <Petr> what about jvm support&
[14:51] <lizmat> there is a JVM backend, but it misses some features

[16:20] <Tirifto> Hello! Is there a way to re-dispatch a method call to a role that the given class does? The method resolution order only includes parent classes, but not roles, so stuff like ‚Äòcallsame‚Äô doesn‚Äôt work. Is anything like it available for roles, too?
[16:21] <Tirifto> (I guess I could inherit from the role instead, but that feels a bit hacky.)
[16:21] <MasterDuke> maybe explicitly calling `RoleName::method-name()`
[16:24] <Tirifto> Ohh, ‚Äò::‚Äô, I didn‚Äôt realise that was a thing that would work here!
[16:28] <Tirifto> Or maybe it wouldn‚Äôt. :P | Could not find symbol '&remove' in 'Container'
