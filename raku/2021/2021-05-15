[02:50] <tonyo> .tell canbenshan you're likely hitting an issuer with the scheduler filling the pool and blocking the main loop, look at $*SCHEDULER.max_threads and don't hit that limit, see if that fixes your issue.

[02:50] <tellable6> tonyo, I haven't seen canbenshan around, did you mean canbenshanlo?

[02:50] <tonyo> .tell canbenshanlo you're likely hitting an issuer with the scheduler filling the pool and blocking the main loop, look at $*SCHEDULER.max_threads and don't hit that limit, see if that fixes your issue.

[02:50] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to canbenshanlo

[02:53] <tonyo> m: my @a; @a.push(start { sleep 5; }) for 0..$*SCHEDULER.max_threads * 2; await @a;

[02:53] <tonyo> nice

[02:53] <tonyo> the first one hangs on my machine, the latter doesn't.

[02:59] <raydiak> camelia's probably just hitting a ulimit or some such

[03:01] <tonyo> might be locked down to avoid some kind of abuse too?

[03:02] <raydiak> that's one of the things ulimits are for

[03:02] <raydiak> so we can't e.g. forkbomb it

[03:02] <tonyo> that seems like the first thing that should be tried 

[03:04] <raydiak> I mean, someone has to be that guy, right? in the name of testing and hardening! purely whitehat :)

[03:04] <raydiak> fwiw neither of those hangs on my machine for whatever reason

[03:06] <raydiak> * 2 takes longer, by about 3x. I assume because the main thread probably counts as one, so there's one more left to run after the first two batches

[03:07] <raydiak> yes, *2-1 makes it only take 2x as long, as expected

[03:10] <tonyo> wonder if that was fixed

[03:11] <tonyo> must've been if *2 doesn't hang

[03:12] <raydiak> maybe. I'm on 2021.04

[03:12] <tonyo> i'm on 2021.03

[03:14] <raydiak> gfldex's https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3817 still fails for me, though. that's not a hang though, it just loses the output
