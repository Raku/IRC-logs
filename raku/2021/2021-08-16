[01:15] <mjgardner> Um, has anyone else noticed that docs.raku.org and modules.raku.org have been down for a bit today?

[01:19] <[Coke]> was slow for me just now, but now it's coming up fine.

[01:32] <mjgardner> Weird, I can ping it but can’t browse to it, and this reports it’s down: https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/modules.raku.org

[01:32] <moon-child> I can't access either either

[01:37] <[Coke]> I know historically we've had problems with some ISPs reaching the site. modules is also hanging on load right now...

[01:42] <[Coke]> now I have a cloudflare error

[02:07] <mjgardner> It’s making it hard to source links for this blog post.

[02:18] <mjgardner> I thought I might try turning off Wi-Fi on my phone and go through Verizon rather than my home AT&T Internet, but that’s also hanging.

[02:42] <mjgardner> Also getting Cloudflare Error 522: “An Error 522 means that the request was able to connect to your web server, but that the request didn't finish. The most likely cause is that something on your server is hogging resources.”

[02:43] <mjgardner> I had similar issues when I was on a shared web host. It’s no fun when a co-tenant can take you down.

[05:35] <Xliff> When using Inline::Perl5 to access modules like Email::MIME, when perl does "Email::MIME->create( header_str => [ ... ])"

[05:35] <Xliff> Will that be written out the same, like so: "Email::MIME.create( header_str => [ ... ])"

[05:36] <Xliff> Because I have the feeling the last version isn't parsing my arguments, properly.

[11:09] <Xliff> nine: Yeah, I thought so too until I actually had to throw Data::Dumper into the installed module to see for myself.

[11:10] <Xliff> nine: In perl5, naked "key => value" resolves into [ $key, $value ]

[11:10] <Xliff> Successive pairs add on to that list. Inline::Perl5 seems to want to take each pair and place them in their own arrayref.

[11:11] <Xliff> So "key1 => value1, key2 => value2" is "[ [key1 => value1], [key2 => value2] ] instead of "[ $key1, $value1, $key2, $value2 ]"

[11:11] <Xliff> It seems the latter is what my module needed.

[11:13] <nine> I wouldn't know how that could be the case. Do you have a reduced test case, showing the problem?

[11:15] <Xliff> Not really. Closest thing I have to something that illustrates the problem needs Email::MIME

[11:15] <nine> Should be easy to create a dummy module with a method taking and dumping those args

[11:30] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/8b70f4309f3551508787e401d1cccfdd

[11:31] <Xliff> nine: So it's sorted. Inline::Perl5 has been a great help.

[11:35] <nine> Ah, now I understand. foo(a => 1, b => 2) would do what you expect, since I special cased pairs in argument lists. The same is not true when converting arrays. Each array element is converted individually to its Perl equivalent.

[14:54] <perryprog> Ew.

[14:55] <Altreus> there is

[14:55] <sjn> yes, there is a Raku discord

[14:55] <Altreus> sometimes people use it

[14:55] <Altreus> irc is far more active though

[14:56] <El_Che> so are irceans

[14:56] <ens> fair enough. but i thought new gen people don't use irc much

[14:57] <ens> maybe i'm just biased.

[14:57] <Altreus> vaguely true

[14:57] <El_Che> I thought there were bridges

[14:57] <sjn> There are

[14:57] <ens> i tried to get my friend on irc and she called it 'the HAM radio of the internet'

[14:57] * sjn tries to find the invitation link to the discord server, but can't seem to find it

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <altreus™#9000> might even work

[14:58] <Altreus> hey it does

[14:58] <[Coke]> irc is the worst. I love the ham radio of the internet analogy, will be stealing that.

[14:58] <Altreus> here it is https://discord.gg/gg2a3T6

[14:59] <ens> nice one, btw is discord-raku-bot in raku and open source? i would love to see how it works.

[14:59] <Altreus> it's in #info-and-rules but you have to scroll up

[14:59] <Altreus> discord-raku-bot: source

[14:59] <Altreus> all bots should support that

[14:59] <Altreus> I should probably find some time for API::Discord

[14:59] <sjn> Altreus: where did you find it?

[15:00] <ens> i coded a discord bot in perl5 but it was such a mess.

[15:00] <ens> doesn't seem like there's good support for it that i could find anyway.

[15:03] <sjn> Altreus: thanks :)

[15:03] <Altreus> ens: start off by understanding it ... which is a challenge because I don't and I wrote it

[15:03] <Altreus> I have definitely chosen an architecture that I find too difficult to fit in my head

[15:04] <Altreus> some of that is me trying to make use of what Raku allows for

[15:04] <El_Che> Altreus: in riddle you do talk

[15:05] <Altreus> all software is a riddle for humans and clear for computers

[15:05] <gfldex> ens: the bridge-and-eval-bot is pure Raku but not in the public eye yet. The code is still quite gnarly.

[15:05] <ens> lizmat: sorry to hear about Robert Lemmen. Seems like quite a prolific guy for raku and in debian project.

[15:06] <lizmat> he was more prolific for debian than raku, but yeah  :-)

[15:07] <Altreus> yes I saw this go by, but I confess I had never heard of him

[15:07] <Altreus> It's sad that his passing was not noted immediately

[15:07] <lizmat> yes  :-(

[15:08] <Altreus> tbf I have no idea how I would make it known if I popped my clogs unexpectedly

[15:09] <Altreus> I still wonder what happened to f00li5h

[15:09] <gfldex> that's not really your job

[15:09] <El_Che> dead man switch?

[15:10] <El_Che> I didn't see his name on debian lists besides on the release announcement

[15:11] <gfldex> whereby  I had once a case with a contract, signed by a person who died 5 years prior.

[15:11] <lizmat> Altreus: well, that's just the problem.  Contributors sometime just don't have time, and are then just absent

[15:11] <lizmat> there's generally no reason to expect any other reason

[15:12] <lizmat> in the case of Jeff Goff and Jonathan Scott Duff, it was much clearer

[15:12] <lizmat> but I also guess because I knew them more personally and from conferences as well

[15:13] <Altreus> There's no dead man switch that is safe from ADHD

[15:14] <Altreus> I pretty much vanished from IRC for quite a long time myself
