[00:03] <muffindrake> Hello, is it possible to get raku docs in one text file, or failing that one html file? The link on docsraku.org 404s on me

[01:15] <phogg> muffindrake: A version named perl6 still exists (https://docs.raku.org/perl6.html) but I don't know whether it's being updated as things change.

[01:15] <phogg> docs

[01:15] <phogg> er, sorry wrong window

[01:17] <phogg> muffindrake: this issue was reported here https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3632 and is still open, for whatever that's worth

[01:38] <phogg> muffindrake: looks like you can build it yourself from the doc git repo checkout (zef install Pod::To::BigPage; make bigpage; html2text html/raku.html > ~/raku.txt)

[01:39] <phogg> I can't certify it will work, but it's working *so far* for me

[01:43] <phogg> muffindrake: for the record it finished after a few minutes. The text version is not very readable, but it works too. Opening the HTML in lynx is a better experience.

[12:38] * lizmat drops a pin

[12:45] <mark[m]3> Hi all, I'm running into a problem trying to install (well, update actually) raku on a raspberrypi 3B+ running archlinuxarm, the error I have is "While looking for 'CORE.c.setting.moarvm': no such file or directory"

[12:45] <mark[m]3> bit more context here: https://pastebin.com/FdJKH2fp

[12:46] <mark[m]3> this little thing has had raku on it and running for ages now, it seems like the last update has something to do with it but I can't see how‚Ä¶

[12:46] <mark[m]3> nqp and moarvm install ok

[12:46] <mark[m]3> but rakudo 2021.02.1 doesn't

[12:46] <moritz> mark[m]3: is tihs a parallel build?

[12:46] <mark[m]3> moritz:  how can I tell that?

[12:47] <moritz> mark[m]3: did you start it with make -j2 or something?

[12:47] <mark[m]3> oh right

[12:47] <mark[m]3> no I'm using the PKGBUILD here and it just uses "make": https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=rakudo

[12:48] <mark[m]3> no multithreading or anything

[12:49] <moritz> I'm trying a build locally here to see if that works

[12:50] <mark[m]3> oh thanks for digging into this!

[12:51] <moritz> can't promise anything

[12:51] <mark[m]3> no no sure that's fine :)

[12:51] <moritz> for me, it says +++ Compiling	blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm

[12:51] <moritz> (with a real tab in there)

[12:51] <moritz> right before the "The following step can take a long time, please be patient." message

[12:52] <moritz> huh, it seems it only compiedl the .d variant for you

[12:52] <mark[m]3> yeah, I get that two. From looking at the makefile it repeats everything for 6.c first, and then the 6.d (which it does√†

[12:53] <moritz> is there a blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm file?

[12:53] <mark[m]3> I get those two*

[12:53] <mark[m]3> no there isn't‚Ä¶

[12:53] <moritz> and what do you get when you run `make blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm`?

[12:53] <mark[m]3> This is what I have:

[12:53] <mark[m]3> rakudo]# fd CORE.c

[12:53] <mark[m]3> src/rakudo-2021.02.1/gen/moar/CORE.c.setting

[12:54] <moritz> that's not yet fully compiled

[12:54] *** plvicente joined
[12:54] <mark[m]3> but the "Compiling blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm" step, which "can take a long time" and prints out all the stage timings works fine. It then moves on to the CORE.d.setting.moarvm stage and then errs out

[12:55] <mark[m]3> yes I mean that's all I have‚Ä¶ there is no .setting.moarvm

[12:55] <moritz> and what do you get when you run `make blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm`?

[12:56] <mark[m]3> just running that now

[12:59] *** Kaiepi left
[13:00] <mark[m]3> it's still running but I just noticed something interesting. Around the end of that run for making CORE.c.settings.moarvm, there is this line:

[13:00] *** Kaiepi joined
[13:00] <mark[m]3> "Stage optimize   : +++ Generating       gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP/v6d.nqp"

[13:00] <mark[m]3> I think that is actually missing the time, like other lines say "Stage parse      : 611.789"

[13:01] <mark[m]3> so something probably fails around the end of "Compiling   blib/CORE.c.setting.moarvm", during the optimize stage, but doesn't seem to print out any error‚Ä¶

[13:01] *** Kaiepi left
[13:01] <moritz> the lines starting with +++ generally don't have timings

[13:02] <mark[m]3> yes I see that, the line starting with "Stage optimize: " should have a time, and it shouldn't end with "+++ Generating‚Ä¶"

[13:03] <mark[m]3> (I didn't remove a newline in that, it is all on the same line, which is obviously wrong)

[13:03] <moritz> it does look like several things are executing at once

[13:04] <moritz> do you have MAKEFLAGS environment variable set?

[13:04] <moritz> (this is a GNU make, right?)

[13:05] *** plvicente left
[13:05] <mark[m]3> `env | grep MAKE` returns nothing

[13:06] <mark[m]3> and it's `GNU Make 4.3`

[13:06] <mark[m]3> and for certainty's sake, I can see in htop that only one thread is running off my make command

[13:08] <moritz> let's wait for that make command to finish

[13:08] <mark[m]3> ok it just did‚Ä¶

[13:09] <moritz> successfully?

[13:09] <mark[m]3> no error, but the "Stage optimize" has no time on it, and that's the last line, and there still is no CORE.d.setting.moarvm file

[13:09] <mark[m]3> sorry CORE.c

[13:09] *** Kaiepi joined
[13:10] <moritz> what was the exit code?

[13:12] <moritz> or is there somethin in the syslog about an OOM kill or so?

[13:12] <moritz> I'm really grasping at straws here

[13:12] <mark[m]3> thanks for the suggestions :)

[13:12] <mark[m]3> I'm stupid actually I didn't think to check the exit code, I ran another command right after from the same shell so it's gone now‚Ä¶

[13:12] <mark[m]3> I'll run it again

[13:12] <mark[m]3> nothing in the syslog

[13:13] <mark[m]3> ram is the first thought I had and I have 2Gb swap so that should be ok

[13:13] <mark[m]3> OH no wow that is it!

[13:13] <mark[m]3> it's earlyoom that has dumb settings (ahem‚Ä¶ I set them :/)

[13:14] <mark[m]3> really sorry for all that!

[13:14] <moritz> no problem, glad I have helped a bit :D

[13:14] <mark[m]3> you were great üëç

[13:15] <mark[m]3> forced me to double check everything that's what I needed obviously :)

[13:21] <mark[m]3> the telltale journald log line: "Mar 12 12:56:43 musicpi earlyoom[324]: sending SIGTERM to process 21880 uid 1001 "moar": badness 943, VmRSS 632 MiB" (poor moar, that's very bad!)

[13:21] *** jmerelo left
[13:30] <moritz> why does that remind me of latex, with "badness 10000" everywhere? :D

[13:33] *** Froogal joined
[13:36] <Froogal> Hi!¬† I have been happily learning Raku for a little while now, but my progress is very much hindered by the Raku site not working for me.¬† I constantly get SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG error.¬† If I type in raku.org and seemingly start a new session its fine for a little bit, but as soon as I start clicking on links I get this error.¬† If I

[13:36] <Froogal> search for something and Raku docs come up in the results and I click it I consistently get this error.¬† It's driving me crazy lol

[13:38] <moritz> huh, weird, never heard of that before

[13:38] <moritz> Froogal: which country are you in? which browser do you use?

[13:38] <Froogal> Its very consistent with me, and happens on my mobile browser as well.

[13:38] <Froogal> US Firefox

[13:39] <Froogal> Just tried chromium, getting the same error.

[13:40] <Froogal> Sorry chromium gives ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR

[13:41] <Froogal> I almost don't have access to the docs because I have to browse raku site in a very specific way, or I cant access docs.

[13:42] <Froogal> Is there a way to reach out to the site maintainers?¬† This has been bothersome for quite some time and I want to let them know and provide more info if they need.

[13:43] <moritz> I think @jjmerelo on twitter, and either jjmerelo or twitter here would be the maintainer

[13:43] <moritz> and rba is doing general infrastructure stuff

[13:49] *** Froogal left
[13:49] *** Froogal joined
[13:50] <mark[m]3> Froogal:  for what it's worth, when I went to a place with no internet a while ago and was doing quite a bit of raku work I installed the docs locally from https://github.com/Raku/doc

[13:52] <Froogal> Ohhhhhh that might be very helpful, thank you! :)

[13:52] <rba> Froogal: do you get the same error for https://docs.rakulang.site ?

[13:52] <mark[m]3> it's pretty easy to get it set up

[13:53] <Froogal> rba No it seems to work for now on that url.

[13:53] <Froogal> I can search

[13:54] <Froogal> Im on this one when it breaks https://docs.raku.org/

[13:54] *** ex_nihilo left
[13:55] <rba> Both sites are the same. 

[13:55] <Froogal> I just broke it tho lol

[13:55] <Froogal> and the one you sent works

[13:57] <Froogal> Can I attatch screen shots?

[13:58] <rba> Froogal: Do you have more error message and other info? Seems to happen only from US. I send you the emails as pvt. 

[13:59] <rba> It was reported this week already. I have turned

[13:59] <Froogal> rba I do I can provide more info, I have to go to work now sadly.¬† I'll get back on here after work.

[14:00] <Froogal> Oh cool I'm not the only one with error message.¬† Thank you for the help!¬† take care

[14:00] <rba> of Cloudflares proxies. Yet I don‚Äôt understand why it still happens.  

[14:01] <rba> Froogal: All fine. Need to go back skiing:-)

[14:02] <Froogal> rba luuuucky XD

[14:02] *** Froogal left
[14:02] <mark[m]3> rba:  oh you've still got snow! It's all melting here (southern French Alps‚Ä¶)

[14:02] <rba> Here in CH too. Very happy to have the chance

[14:03] <rba> to spend some time outdoors...

[14:06] <leont> Yeah, proxies are the most likely candidate for such issues
