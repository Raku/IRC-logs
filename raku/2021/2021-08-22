[01:08] <casaca> moon-child: thank you for the notes. 

[01:10] <moon-child> actually, on further consideration, 0 seems like it should be a valid value for posix-time.  So maybe use // instead of ||, and don't have a default of 0

[09:13] <lizmat> andinus: they are up for me (now)

[09:21] <andinus> up now :)

[09:25] <rba> andinus: I was able to resolve the problem on the webhosting server. Let me know in case it is down again.

[09:25] <nine> rba: what was the issue?

[09:25] <nine> I couldn't even connect via ssh

[09:26] <rba> nine: I guess resource issues from a trial to login with different users.

[09:26] <rba> nine: Luckily I was still logged in using mosh.

[09:27] <rba> nine: I have installed fail2ban and hope this will not happen again.

[09:27] <rba> nine: You may have a look at auth.log or in journalctl. If you see anything else, I would be interessted.

[09:38] <nine> Looks like our grafana is not collecting any metrics from lavm-perl6infra-1 :/

[23:55] <mjgardner> Mind if I offer a bit of ported Perl code for critique? Could this be written any better or using Raku features? https://gist.github.com/mjgardner/9edadb77708908a4aae0d12de44b458d
