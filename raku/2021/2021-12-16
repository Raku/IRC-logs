[08:14] <atroxaper> Hello! is there a way to take an access to private attribute of an object from a method of its class? Like class A { has $!a is built; method plus(A:U: A $one, A $two) { A.new(a => $one!a + $two!a) }

[08:36] <moritz_> do you want it to initialized in .new generally, or do you want that option only inside the class? If the latter, you need to write a private constructor.

[08:43] <atroxaper> moritz_: I need to get an access to privete attribute inside a class method. method foo(A:U: A $var) { $var!attribute } means call !attribute method instead of !attribute attribute

[08:45] <atroxaper> moritz_: In C I can manipulate private attributes of not only 'this' object, but any object of the class inside of a class's method.

[08:56] <moritz_> C doesn't have anything private, I believe :D

[08:57] <moritz_> and in C++, you know at compile time that the object is of that class

[08:57] <moritz_> currently I don't know how raku handles it

[09:03] <atroxaper> moritz_: I think there should be some syntax construction. Because $var!private-method works. I found solution only in creation a method !a() {$!a}

[10:05] <ssaint> When is Raku supporting mobile (android, ios, etc) development?

[10:05] <moon-child> ssaint: when you implement it

[10:06] <ssaint> Who? Me???? That will take 1000 years. How am I going to do that?

[10:06] *** Oshawott joined
[10:07] <ssaint> I am a Mechanical engineer who like to code at home. No background in Computer Science.

[10:07] <moon-child> well, I think no one is _disinterested_ in such things, but it is no small effort, and there are other things that are farther up on people's priority lists

[10:08] <moon-child> so for it to happen requires somebody to take an interest and make a concerted effort

[10:09] <synthmeat> everyone needs their thing :)

[10:10] <ssaint> I get you. Indeed Raku is great...so I was just wondering why the developers are not giving much attention to desktop/mobile development.

[10:10] *** archenoth left
[10:10] <synthmeat> they're paying a lot of attention to a lot of things

[10:11] <lizmat> and they're generally not getting pid for what they do

[10:11] <ssaint> and mobile/desktop development is not necessary as at now? That is strange!!

[10:11] <moon-child> what synthmeat said.  But, here is something concrete: most mobile devices run arm, and the only performant raku implementation (moarvm) does not have an arm target

[10:11] *** ssaint left
[10:12] <lizmat> goodbye ssaint, pleasant dreaming

[10:12] <synthmeat> i'd personally be happy with getting rakudo-star new linux release. that ain't asking too much, is it? :P

[10:12] <synthmeat> that's something ongoing, right?

[10:12] <lizmat> again, we would need somebody to do that

[10:13] <synthmeat> kinda needs someone with developed taste/experience with modules ecosystem

[10:13] *** ssaint joined
[10:15] <ssaint> ...had low battery. Went offline, and now I can't find the discussion I raised about Raku supporting mobile development.

[10:18] <lizmat> https://logs.liz.nl/raku/2021-12-16.html#10:05

[10:18] <lizmat> ssaint: sorry I interpreted your leaving of the channel as a rage quit

[10:18] * lizmat tries to be less grumpy

[10:19] <ssaint> Thank you. I can't leave Raku community just like that.

[10:19] <synthmeat> aww

[10:21] <lizmat> ssaint: but seriously, yes, I would love to see more Raku development on mobile devices

[10:21] <ssaint> I have been jumping around programming languages but I think Raku seems to have got things RIGHT. Nice Powerful Language. It only pains me I can't use it for mobile apps.'=(

[10:22] <lizmat> ssaint: well apart from walled gardens like on Apple making it hard to do anything that is not within company policies

[10:22] <lizmat> there's no inherent reason why things wouldn't work on mobild

[10:22] <lizmat> *mobile

[10:22] <lizmat> and maybe performance isn't such a big issue for the things that one may want to do on mobile apps

[10:23] <lizmat> at least for some applications

[10:24] <ssaint> Thanks for your responses. I am grateful.

[10:25] <ssaint> ...maybe I can politely request to leave now. Thank you once again.

[11:06] <tbrowder> .ask ssaint what kind of mobile app do you want?

[11:06] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ssaint

[11:07] <El_Che> synthmeat: what do you need specifally? There are up-to-date linux packages and zef

[11:19] <synthmeat> El_Che: i guess someone to make a binary build newer than 2021.04 and put it on https://rakudo.org/star

[11:19] <synthmeat> and for rstar specifically, i've no idea what to choose from ecosystem (which json/csv parsing libs, etc.) so i welcome someone picking out those

[11:19] <synthmeat> so that's what i like about it, is all

[11:20] <synthmeat> that someone went out and confirmed all those run fine

[11:21] <El_Che> synthmeat: so the only thing you miss is someone recommending a library?

[11:22] <El_Che> synthmeat: install this https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg, and use zef to install whatever you need from here https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/etc/modules.txt

[11:25] <El_Che> synthmeat: I don't think there will be a rakudo star release any time soon. I don't think there is a star release manager any more (I may be wrong)

[11:25] <synthmeat> okie, that's good enough for me. thanks.

[11:26] <El_Che> I pkg the linux packages, so feel free to ping me

[11:26] <synthmeat> cloudsmith. cool.

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> do you guys know how "is cached" works? let's suppose my function returns an object. Do I get the same object when a cached call is made?

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or do I get a new copy?

[11:44] <lizmat> you get the same object

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that makes more sense

[15:03] <atroxaper> Am I right that if I want to avoid parenthesis when calling a sub or a method then I need a colon for method and do not need colon for sub. Why there is a difference?

[15:07] <atroxaper> Is this because we can control subs' signatures at compile time, but not method signatures?

[23:18] <[Coke]> wish there was a way to say "I never want a Seq"

[23:19] <[Coke]> I find it painful to get caught by the "Iterator already consumed" when I never wanted iterators in the first place.

[23:24] <[Coke]> (found it, had an array of arrays that turned into an array of Seq after I used a map. 

[23:26] <moon-child> I definitely feel tha5t

[23:26] <moon-child> maybe a dynamic variable?

[23:26] <moon-child> $*MONKEY-HIDE-NO-SEQ

[23:43] <lizmat> [Coke]: the alternative would be that all Seq would be hidden (and cached) in a List

[23:43] <lizmat> which would be a serious performance issue

[23:43] <lizmat> afk&

[23:45] <moon-child> yeah for performance-sensitive code you wouldn't want it, but for quick scripts it could be convenient
