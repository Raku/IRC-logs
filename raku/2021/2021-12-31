[00:01] <spacekookie> I managed to trace through the grammar and it kinda just seems like TOP is never executed. All other functions return what they're supposed to return and then it just ends

[00:04] <MasterDuke> spacekookie: now is probably too late, but you could trying pinging moritz_ tomorrow. he's the grammar expert (literally wrote the raku book on grammars)

[00:05] <spacekookie> Oh cool! Thank you!

[00:05] <spacekookie> I didn't know there was a raku book on grammars. That sounds like something I might want to read

[00:06] <MasterDuke> https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/ (link from https://raku.org/resources/)

[00:07] <MasterDuke> the book is good

[20:22] <guifa> ugh I still can't think of a topic for FOSDEM.  I've got some stuff planned for P&C but no real way to preview it / prep it in time for FOSDEM

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <guifa> Thanks for reminding me! I planning to post a proposal today.

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Here is a link to my Wolfram Community post "Connecting Mathematica and Raku" : https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2434981 . (I am not proposing that to FOSDEM...)

[20:40] <guifa> I've always thought it could be a cool demonstration of Raku's extensibility to make a module to extend Numeric to go beyond just complex numbers

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> For my PhD studies in applied mathematics I did all my course work in all of these three languages/systems: Mathematica, Maple, MATLAB.

[20:42] <guifa> Like maybe some low hanging fruit could be somehow figuring out how to do n-roots losslessly, such that (‚àö7)¬≤ == 7, just like (1/3) * 3 == 3 because of Rats

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Mathematica was a clear winner.

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yeah. Actually, it can be seen in the section "Encoders and decoders" in that post that Raku rationalizes the numbers given to it from Mathematica. Very few systems, except Mathematica can do that in a native way.

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @guifa My FOSDEM proposal is extended version of this work: https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2021/12/31/introduction-to-data-wrangling-with-raku/

[21:22] <moon-child> guifa: cas get hairy quickly.  But I would still love to see something like that

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child Same here. In many ways I see Raku as the only potentially serious competitor of Mathematica.

[21:29] <moon-child> competitor in what respect?

[21:29] <moon-child> I don't think anybody does all of things that mathematica does

[21:29] <moon-child> and I think that, for every interesting thing that mathematica does, there is at least somebody else who does it too

[21:36] <guifa> moon-child yeah, a full CAS would be awesome, but overkill and almost certainly would be best just wrapping and passing to extant systems. 

[21:36] <guifa> But maybe with some work basic trig (possibly with œÄ/œÑ, similar to how i works in complex numbers) and n-roots would add a lot of precision to every day ops 

[21:38] <moon-child> even just with rational powers, checking equality gets hairy

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-chiled " I don't think anybody does all of things that mathematica does" -- agreed. Especially the synergy between symbolic and numerical computations is hard to replicate.

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child "and I think that, for every interesting thing that mathematica does, there is at least somebody else who does it too" -- That is a claim many people make. I am not convinced. I have seen similar and inferior functionalities in other systems.

[22:57] <moon-child> cyc has the knowledge set.  Maxima has the cas.  Lisp has the symbolic manipulation and term-rewriting
