[00:44] <dwarring> LibXML's t/11memory.t seems to suddenly running, much better, just since since the 2021.08 release and blead

[00:44] <tellable6> 2021-08-05T00:43:49Z #raku <Xliff> dwarring Thanks!

[00:44] <dwarring> test is disabled by default and needs to have environment variables set to run it:

[00:45] <dwarring> (export AUTHOR_TESTING=1 MEMORY_TEST=1; prove -e'raku -I.' -v t/11memory.t)

[00:45] <dwarring> results...

[00:46] <dwarring> on 2021.08: Total Mem Increase:64116 kB, Avg-Objects:873, Lost:719 Objects (0.25%)

[00:47] <dwarring> on  v2021.08-8-g5492452b2: Total Mem Increase:5612 kB, Avg-Objects:101, Lost:14 Objects (0.00%)

[00:48] <dwarring> The count is of LibXML native objects, which get freed when DESTROY is called

[00:49] <dwarring> call to DESTROY isn't being missing and is tending to get called earlier

[00:49] <dwarring> leading to flatter memory usage and fewer live objects

[00:57] <kybr> if i have the name of a method as a string in $method, how might i call that method on $foo ?

[00:57] *** pisa joined
[00:58] <dwarring> $foo."$method"()

[00:58] <pisa> hi, is there some advice for raku binding for c++ template ? 

[00:58] <kybr> dwarring: wow. thanks

[01:04] <dwarring> I haven't used the c++ bindings myself

[01:04] <dwarring> I do know you want to use the CPPStruct representation

[01:05] <dwarring> class C is repr('CPPStruct') {...}

[01:05] <dwarring> some tests in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/t/04-nativecall/13-cpp-mangling.t

[01:06] <dwarring> That should automatically mangle Raku method names to C++ symbols

[01:12] <pisa> that test just for CPPStruct repr, but no template

[01:46] <dominix> hi everyone, quick question, what do you guy have as newsfeed regarding Rakulang ? 

[01:46] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:49:13Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: what kind of package sys does clear linux use? is it fedora or debian based?

[01:46] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:56:01Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: never mind. i see the problem i would have with clear linux. i, being retired, would have the luxury of telling my client "no" to clear linux, but he's paying for that agony.

[01:46] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T01:57:37Z #raku <tbrowder> dominix: but your client wants you to use raku? maybe client will pay for a clear linux raku pkg.

[01:46] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T08:08:22Z #raku <El_Che> dominix It looks like Clear Linux uses flatpack as pkg format. Timotimo just release a rakudo release oin that format

[01:46] <tellable6> 2020-09-28T08:15:54Z #raku <El_Che> dominix: nevr mind about the flatpack. However precompiled non-pkg release can be found here: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2020.09, just untar-gzip this: rakudo-pkg-mooarvm-2020.09-01-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

[01:49] <kybr> how about if i wanted to get a reference to the function/method with the string name in $function?

[01:50] <timo> that depends on how you can reach it. it mayb e enough to just get my $func-obj = ::($function)

[10:50] <lizmat> yes, and that's fine, but *I* only see tweets with Camelia in them now  :-)

[10:53] <lizmat> and Raku pottery even more so

[10:54] <lizmat> having lived with a potter for 5 years made me appreciate the inspiration and sweat that goes into making pottery

[10:55] <lizmat> not unlike the Raku programming language, actually  :-)

[13:13] <lizmat> raydiak: yeah, was thinking about that... haven't been able to come up with a suitable replacement yet

[13:16] <raydiak> no great idea here either, though off the top of my head I think of a bunch of people with ores rowing a boat

[13:17] <raydiak> not exciting enough though

[13:19] <raydiak> people rowing a boat over the edge of a waterfall is more exciting, but the connotations are a bit negative

[13:34] <raydiak> one real idea, perhaps something similar to https://thisadventurelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/para.png would be appropriate and resonate with our predominantly european community?
