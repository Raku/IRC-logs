[14:40] <[Coke]> it's been a while; what's being done in "make spectest" after the warning about inline::perl5 but before the first test is run?

[14:40] <[Coke]> (it's VERY slow on win)

[14:41] <MasterDuke> it's slow on linux too

[14:48] <dakkar> I *guess* that's when the "fudge" happens?

[14:50] <dakkar> which is written in raku, and calls another raku program for each test file to fudge

[14:50] <dakkar> oops, sorry, no, it's written in perl5

[14:51] <dakkar> [Coke]: it's probably t/spec/fudgeall

[15:03] <[Coke]> ah, right. thanks

[15:49] <Xliff> If I'm using rakubrew, what's the command to build latest raku from git? "rakubrew build moar blead" doesn't seem to work anymore

[15:55] <Xliff> Huh.

[15:55] <Xliff> "rakubrew build moar master" did the trick.

[15:59] <ugexe> rakubrew build moar-blead

[16:02] <Xliff> Oh. LOL

[21:19] <melezhik> now has small notification system. whenever someone reply to your post (review or comment) you'll see this in the navbar - https://twitter.com/melezhik2/status/1453833642116059142

[21:19] <melezhik> baby steps, but at least better then nothing )))

[21:20] <melezhik> so if someone would help me test that I'd appreciate ... 

[21:22] <El_Che> if you accept my terrible comment: the colours, my eyes

[21:23] <melezhik> you can change to light theme ...

[21:23] <melezhik> there is the link

[21:24] <El_Che> better

[21:24] <El_Che> isn't black as a default a weird choice?

[21:25] <El_Che> anyway, lots of people like black teams probably

[21:25] <melezhik> black?

[21:25] <El_Che> black

[21:25] <El_Che> dark

[21:25] <melezhik> ah ... I see now

[21:25] <El_Che> the version of a site with dark colours that makes it unreadable :)

[21:26] <melezhik> yes you are right my recent commit made dark theme is default

[21:26] <melezhik> lets run a poll? :') 

[21:26] <El_Che> I have collegues that use a browser plugin to make everything dark theme

[21:27] <El_Che> only a few, though

[21:27] <melezhik> I have a bunch of questions I would like to ask about people about mybfio design/UX , maybe create a post somehow ...

[21:27] <melezhik> "I have collegues that use a browser plugin to make everything dark theme" oh , :') 

[21:28] <melezhik> it's not I like the dark theme very much, I just think it looks slightly better then light

[21:28] <El_Che> it literally tires my eyes

[21:28] <melezhik> it's hard to decide - basically I am limited by https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/ 

[21:28] <El_Che> to much contrast I think

[21:29] <melezhik> i can even make it configurable though UI - so a user choose form all of them

[21:29] <melezhik> I see ...

[21:29] <melezhik> thanks for feedback

[21:31] <El_Che> it's not a nice one and very subjective one, but better be honest

[21:31] <El_Che> I am pretty sure others love the dark theme

[22:15] <japhb> El_Che, melezhik: Dark themes are necessary for people who get visual migraines.  Surrounding light levels matter for that as well; at my previous company, we had the maintenance teams turn off some of the overhead lighting banks to allow for intentional darker areas.  On the flip side, we had team members who really needed bright surroundings, and always took the window seats and bright overhead lights.
