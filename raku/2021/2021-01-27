[12:45] <PimDaniel> Hi! \o

[12:46] *** stoned75 left
[12:47] <PimDaniel> I've an unicode problem : using uxterm, raku -v shows me glyphs all unreadable. :( Is there a special police or special terminal tu use?

[12:48] <MasterDuke> that's a font problem. you need to set the font in your terminal to one with the unicode characters

[12:48] <[Coke]> so, I just did that doc commit, but am suprised at the syntax (which is working) of using $.foo to apparently call a method on the invocant. I don't think this is documented.

[12:48] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: do we have something like https://docs.raku.org/language/unicode_entry but for display?

[12:50] <MasterDuke> i don't think in the docs, but not sure. isn't there something in the problem-solving repo? or user-experience repo?

[12:51] <PimDaniel> MasterDuke: Sorry but my configured font yet supports unicode glyphs.

[12:52] <PimDaniel> The problem is what glyphs does Raku print.

[12:52] <[Coke]> PimDaniel: what OS are you on?

[12:52] <PimDaniel> Linux Debian.

[12:52] <PimDaniel> fonts are into : /usr/share/fonts/X11/ 

[12:54] <[Coke]> I assume if it's raku, you're having trouble with the ⏏ or ｢3｣ ?

[12:54] <[Coke]> (and not something you're generating)

[12:54] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Try a different terminal emulator

[12:55] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Give alacritty a shot

[12:55] <MasterDuke> he said `raku -v`, which now includes some unicode math symbols (i think it's the math ones)

[12:56] <[Coke]> oh, yes.

[12:56] <MasterDuke> PimDaniel: does this display correctly? Welcome to 𝐑𝐚𝐤𝐮𝐝𝐨™ v2020.10.

[12:57] <[Coke]> (those were stripped in a later version, no?)

[12:57] <MasterDuke> i don't see them in Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2020.12-86-g9c7b55612.

[12:57] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Theyre still on my comp

[12:57] <PimDaniel> Coke: The second of your chars prints into irssi-text not the 1st.

[12:57] <MasterDuke> yeah, your font is probably just missing a couple of the glyphs we use

[12:57] <PimDaniel> raku-bridge: <勉人> prints too

[13:02] <PimDaniel> Ok : it's a pain to change xterm font! :( but it has always be. 

[13:03] <PimDaniel> Thank's to all of you i think i'll found a solution to my problem...

[13:03] <MasterDuke> there should be a way to enable/configure fallback. then if your font doesn't have a glyph it will look in whatever font you've set as the fallback

[13:03] *** Black_Ribbon left
[13:03] <MasterDuke> so you could use something prettier, but have noto as the fallback

[13:03] <raku-bridge> <勉人> Alacritty uses ur comps default monospace font U can set that up using fontweak

[13:53] <RaycatWhoDat> Is there a way to make .pred or .succ on an Enumeration wrap around?

[13:58] <Scimon> Enumeration is a Role so I would extend it and override those methods personally. 

[14:01] *** Xliff joined
[14:02] <Xliff> How can I force the default sub USAGE to execute?

[14:04] <tadzik> can't you just call it?:)

[14:05] <Scimon> So I'd make my role have a private enum that handles most of the calls just overriding pred and succ (probably with a private index I can wrap around).

[14:05] <Scimon> (Other plans are possible of course).

[14:07] <Xliff> m: sub MAIN { USAGE() }; MAIN

[14:07] <Xliff> tadzik: Nope.

[14:08] <Scimon> I don't think it exists unless you create it.

[14:09] <Scimon> If it doesn't exist the default is to print $*USAGE.

[14:09] <RaycatWhoDat> Scimon: Lemme try that.

[14:09] <Scimon> m: sub MAIN(*@A) { say $*USAGE }; MAIN();

[15:49] <[Coke]> Can you point me at a specific line? (there's a lot in there, and nothing like 'make test')

[15:49] <PimDaniel> In fact i did not run theses tests : i ran : zef --depsonly install ./rakudoc and tests are i suppose a subprocess

[15:50] <[Coke]> ok, so, zef. one sec.

[15:50] *** Possum left
[15:51] <[Coke]> ah. If you're doing "depsonly" install... it's an error in one of the dependencies.

[15:51] <[Coke]> so can you capture the entire output and gist it?

[15:51] <[Coke]> then we can show you which dep it's failing on

[15:51] <[Coke]> (I just did an deps only install here and it was fine.)

[15:52] <PimDaniel> it started downloading modules in ~/.zef/

[15:52] <[Coke]> when I then run 'RAKULIB=lib zef test --verbose .' I get several test failures.

[15:52] <PimDaniel> but i'v lost output.

[15:53] <[Coke]> PimDaniel: yes, you're telling it to install deps............

[15:53] <PimDaniel> is there a log somewhere

[15:54] <PimDaniel> That's the precedure written in README.md

[15:54] <PimDaniel> no?

[15:54] <[Coke]> can you just cut and paste the output the command generates?

[15:54] <PimDaniel> No

[15:54] <PimDaniel> Is there a log?

[15:55] <[Coke]> the command generates no output? how do you know it failed?

[15:56] <[Coke]> for information on zef, see https://github.com/ugexe/zef

[15:56] <PimDaniel> I wrote it yet.

[15:56] <PimDaniel> a minute ...

[15:56] <[Coke]> I can't parse that sentence.

[15:57] <PimDaniel> It fails on tests => No such method 'raku' for invocant of type 'Str'. :(

[15:58] <[Coke]> Can you please cut and paste your session from where you issue the command to the failure and put it on gist.github.com?

[15:58] <PimDaniel> I tell you that i'v lost it

[15:58] <PimDaniel> I must run again

[15:58] <[Coke]> so re-run it?

[15:58] <[Coke]> ok.

[15:59] <PimDaniel> Coke: ok

[15:59] <[Coke]> Thank you- will hopefully help track down the issue.

[15:59] <PimDaniel> should i be root? to run install? there's nothing writen about this?

[16:00] <[Coke]> that depends on you. I regularly run zef as just me, but I'm using it for myself and not sharing my raku install.

[16:00] <[Coke]> OH

[16:00] <[Coke]> if you're running sudo, you're using root's raku, not yours.

[16:00] <[Coke]> is it possible you have a different version installed for root?

[16:01] <PimDaniel> I see a .zef directory into /root/ too !

[16:02] <[Coke]> what does 'sudo raku -v' show?

[16:03] <PimDaniel> ok...

[16:03] <[Coke]> but don't use sudo for zef unless you are trying to install it in a system location.

[16:04] <PimDaniel> but is this zef --depsonly install ./rakudoc needeed?

[16:04] <[Coke]> Yes. that says "install the dependencies this module needs"

[16:04] <PimDaniel> ok

[16:04] <[Coke]> without doing that, you can't expect anything in the module to work

[16:05] <[Coke]> it assumes you've checked it out in a subdir called rakudoc. I would cd to rakudoc and do 'zef --depsonly install .'

[16:05] <PimDaniel> and may i install custom user? where does it install?

[16:05] <[Coke]> but either should work

[16:05] <PimDaniel> hum into ~/.zef maybe?

[16:05] <[Coke]> I think ~/.raku

[16:06] <[Coke]> .zef is for zef while it's working: installs probably to .raku

[16:06] <PimDaniel> yes, it created it.

[16:10] <PimDaniel> the download process overwrites everything! hey man why not complete! 

[16:11] <PimDaniel> https://pastebin.com/b14yLm4W

[16:13] <[Coke]> So the errors are coming from the module "Template::Mustache"

[16:13] <PimDaniel> I think it's because it does not found Mustache

[16:14] <PimDaniel> Coke: I think we need this => Template::Mustache::TestUtil , no?

[16:18] <[Coke]> Yes, but that seems like a different error than the raku version issue.

[16:18] <[Coke]> it might be worth trying to install that module directly and if (when) it fails, open a ticket in its github repo showing the problem.

[16:19] <PimDaniel> Notice that my raku is NOT the debian version which in fact has not yet a raku version.

[16:19] <PimDaniel> I mean for stable Debian release.

[16:20] <[Coke]> for you, do "which raku" and "which perl6" point to the same dir?

[16:20] <PimDaniel> My Raku is in /usr/local/bin/raku

[16:20] <PimDaniel> same dir for perl6

[16:20] <[Coke]> ok. no clue how it's getting the error about .raku method not being found.

[16:21] <[Coke]> but the error is being thrown when you try to install Template::Mustache, based on the gist you shared.

[16:21] <PimDaniel> it's a custom install of rakudo-moar-2020.12-01-linux-x86_64-gcc.tar.gz

[16:21] <[Coke]> I don't see anything obvious (like it trying to shell out to a separate perl6) in that module.

[16:22] <PimDaniel> How to install the module? I'm new to raku?

[16:23] <[Coke]> 'zef install Template::Mustache' will grab the latest from the ecosystem. you could also clone it, cd to it, then 'zef install .'

[16:23] <[Coke]> (the former gets the "released" version. the latter gets "latest from default branch")

[16:24] <[Coke]> .seen softmoth

[16:24] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw softmoth 2017-12-13T15:58:59Z in #perl6-dev: <softmoth> Thanks again!

[16:24] <[Coke]> they haven't been on in a while, but I think ^^ is the author of that module.

[16:26] <PimDaniel> Same error because like -rw-r--r--  1 moi moi    126241 oct.  19 22:58  electronique_ampli_bf_010_pcb.zip

[16:26] <PimDaniel> sorry

[16:27] <PimDaniel> Same error because Template::Mustache was allready a dependency.

[16:27] <PimDaniel> This is the error : Could not find Template::Mustache::TestUtil at line 5 in:

[16:28] *** _jrjsmrtn joined
[16:28] <[Coke]> so now, please open a ticket with T::M ticket queue and paste in that error. include 'raku -v' and OS info.

[16:28] <[Coke]> s/error/command and output inc. the error/

[16:29] <PimDaniel> T::M is a Raku module?

[16:36] <guifa2> T::M was just shorthand for Template::Mustache
