[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I mentioned this yesterday‚Äî I have hard time doing development work with Raku on macOS Monterey. `zef` and `prove6` do not work.  Trying to compile them from sources hangs. Compiling and installing `moar-blead` with `rakubrew` also hangs.

[09:45] *** mfiano left
[09:46] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: sorry to hear that.

[09:47] <lizmat> I'm stuck on Mojave for several reasons, so can't be of much service :(

[09:47] <lizmat> OOC, is this on an M1 ?

[09:48] <El_Che> Anton Antonov#7232: have you tried homebrew? Last time I checked it had raku binaries

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat No, it is on a Intel-processor MacBook Pro.

[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @E_Che I tried `homebrew` ‚Äî I can run Raku. I cannot do much software development with it. (On macOS Monterey.)

[10:46] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: perhaps start with gisting the output of `perl Configure.pl --gen-moar` ?

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Ok. I will try that. (Later today.)

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I have to say I see these problems as my fault ‚Äî I should have not rushed upgrading to macOS Monterey‚Ä¶

[11:08] <El_Che> Can't upu install zef from homebrew of kickstarted with the homebrew raku?

[11:11] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: fwiw, I've come to the conclusion I won't upgrade MacOS anymore

[11:12] <lizmat> after Catalina destroyed all of my videos / audio workflows

[11:12] <lizmat> so the one machine I had upgraded, I had to downgrade to Mojave at great expense and weeks of work  :-(

[11:30] <El_Che> lizmat: how did an OS update do that? They killed previously bundled applications?

[11:34] <lizmat> killed iPhoto for one

[11:34] <lizmat> and with no viable upgrade path

[11:35] <lizmat> they *do* provide an upgrade path, but after it had been busy on my photo database for a **WEEK**, I killed the orocess

[11:35] <lizmat> and that was the 3rd try

[11:36] <El_Che> I read they introduces an app called photos

[11:37] <lizmat> yes, and the conversion program does not run to completion :-(

[11:37] <lizmat> so: iPhoto is capable of handling my photo database (20+ years of *many* pictures), but Photos is not

[11:38] <lizmat> I'm sure it has many nice new features  :-(

[11:38] <lizmat> yes, I'm disappointed in Apple

[11:38] *** [Coke] joined
[11:43] <El_Che> that's a big archive to catalogue again, indeed

[11:50] *** releasable6 joined
[11:53] <lizmat> well, I would understand that it could take a long time to convert

[11:54] <lizmat> but after a week it just sits around doing nothing (0.1% CPU)

[11:54] <lizmat> so I guess the conversion program gets in some sort of deadlock and never recovers

[12:06] * [Coke] is reminded to update https://github.com/coke/scripts/blob/master/sw_hist so he can double check and say "I'm only on 11.x, sorry"

[12:07] <[Coke]> I was one of several people pondering getting an updated mac, but it's a huge investment cost and I'm not feeling great about it. (liz's story a contributing factor)

[12:09] <lizmat> yeah, for the first time in ~20 years, I'm seriously considering not having an MBP for my next notebook

[12:15] <jast> there's a lot of value in using open source software for this kind of thing (if the software in question covers your use case, which isn't always a small "if")...

[12:19] <lizmat> jast: yes, I was going for convenience...  

[12:19] <lizmat> if you want something done well, you have to do it yourself  :-)

[12:19] <jast> true way too often, unfortunately

[12:19] <andinus> SmokeMachine: that works, thank you :)

[12:21] <[Coke]> lizmat: did you see the new mbp has the notch in the menu bar for the camera (like the 11 model iphone) and things render behind the camera?

[12:21] <El_Che> I saw rending beneath

[12:21] <El_Che> menus and the like

[12:22] <lizmat> no

[12:22] <lizmat> won't be looking at a new notebook until sometime next year anyway

[12:24] <El_Che> my main machine is a linux, but the mac I have for testing stuff is getting slow (air)

[12:24] <El_Che> I thought, let's try to get a mbp 16

[12:24] <El_Che> and then I saw the notch

[12:25] <El_Che> I know it would bother me to no end

[12:25] <ugexe> they must have assumed everyone puts tape there anyway

[12:25] <El_Che> ugexe: lol

[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> El_Che I agree the notch on new MacBoo Pros is a deal breaker.

[22:52] <[Coke]> and we can refer to the bug in the commit message as well.
