[09:23] <coldpress> ah yes, the post-multiplication-assignment operator

[09:29] <moon-child> logically, x =* y should be the same as x * x = y

[09:30] <moon-child> some kind of bastard postsquare operator?

[10:00] <tib> Happy new year ! :) 

[10:00] <tib> zef question here o/

[10:02] <tib> When I use : zef install . then remove one of the dependencies (zef uninstall Data::Dump) then run again zef install, it does not install anything, but I assume that my install is broken. 

[10:03] <tib> (yes, using --force-install will do the trick)

[10:04] <tib> This is not really a question, but maybe this deps check could be moved out of --force-install (not sure), I don't know
