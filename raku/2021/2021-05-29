[12:07] <gfldex> is there a way to have zef show all available verions of a ditribution?

[12:14] <lizmat> you mean installed, or in the ecosystem?

[12:22] <lizmat> zef locate foo    # installed modules

[12:23] <lizmat> zef search foo  # ecosystem + installed modules ("From = Zef::Repository::LocalCache")

[19:20] * raydiak looks at https://github.com/Whateverable and notices the status says "Having fun on #perl6 on freenode"

[19:20] <moon-child> this is basically perl6‚Üíraku all over again

[19:21] <raydiak> even that isn't truly done yet...

[19:25] <raydiak> fwiw, I don't know what greppable is grepping, but it seems to be looking at some pretty old versions in some cases. e.g. some of the docs stuff is showing at commits in 2018, I already did a massive grep and perl -pi -e on the docs over a week ago

[19:25] <MasterDuke> it's using moritz's perl6-all-modules, but that hasn't been updated in a long while

[19:26] <MasterDuke> moritz recently asked if anyone would take over, since he doesn't have time to keep it up to date

[19:27] <raydiak> istr he said it was brittle and high-maintenance in unspecified ways

[20:47] <stoned75> hi. I'm working on documenting class Allomorph, and I came across Cool.samemark which is not documented (as a simple proxy on Str.samemark). It should be, right ?

[20:49] <stoned75> or similarly Cool.samecase is documented when Str.samecase is not, when the former is also a simple proxy on the latter...

[20:50] *** rba joined
[20:54] <stoned75> hum and samespace is not documented and not roasted

[20:54] <lizmat> stoned75: on the latter: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4318

[20:55] <lizmat> stoned75: Cool.samecase should also be documented and tests

[20:55] <rba> hell, what happend to #raku on freenode?

[20:55] <stoned75> lizmat: OK noted for samespace, thanks

[20:56] <lizmat> rba: new management of Freenode decided to make an ass of themselves

[20:56] <lizmat> rba: see e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/nlbt0r/freenode_staff_has_nuked_the_raku_channels/

[21:10] <stoned75> hum ms// and ss// are not documented either

[21:10] <lizmat> ++stoned75    :-)

[21:11] <stoned75> ah ss// is ! :) but not indexed

[21:17] <stoned75> m// is mentioned a couple of times as an operator but does not appear in the operator document

[21:26] *** rypervenche joined

[21:35] <lizmat> stoned75: yeah, it is

[21:40] <lizmat> where did you find that?  "p5=>" ?

[21:41] <stoned75> in the "famous" periodic table of operators and in rakudo git history

[21:41] <lizmat> ahh...  ok, consider it abandoned / superseded / removed :-)

[21:41] <lizmat> the periodic table of operators is in need of a gigantic overhaul

[21:42] <lizmat> but otoh, I wonder if it is such a good thing at all, as it overwhelms people in an off-putting way  :-(

[21:42] <lizmat> so I'm also in half a mind to have it just die

[21:42] <stoned75> well as it is, its outdated style matches then ;-)

[21:44] <stoned75> it has been in my wallpaper random pool since it had been published ;-)

[21:44] <lizmat> ah, I see  :-)

[21:47] <lizmat> It *is* a nice wallpaper
