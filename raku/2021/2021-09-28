[08:20] <very> hello `combinations` function has `$of` parameter but `permutations` doesn't. How can I find (n, k) permutations? I couldn't install Math::Libsgl::Permutation on windows

[08:21] <dakkar> very: I'm pretty sure that you're looking for something different that `permutations`

[08:21] <dakkar> "permutations" are (more or less) the different ways of ordering elements in a list

[08:22] <dakkar> m:(1..3).permutations.say

[08:22] <very> dakkar: Python has itertools.permutations I'm looking for the same thing

[08:22] <evalable6> dakkar, rakudo-moar ba15173fd: OUTPUT: «((1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 1 3) (2 3 1) (3 1 2) (3 2 1))␤»

[08:22] <very> https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations

[08:23] <very> it has an `r` parameter

[08:23] <dakkar> uh… that's a strange name for a thing that is *not* generating permutations

[08:23] <moon-child> ^

[08:23] <cnx> iirc in the nPr notation P stands for permutation

[08:24] <moon-child> looks like it's effectively x.cominations($of)).map(&permutations)

[08:25] <moon-child> cnx: or 'pick' (where nCr is 'choose')

[08:25] <cnx> well i could be wrong

[08:28] <very> moon-child thanks for it, then I go for `@a.combinations($of).map(*.permutations.Slip).sort`

[08:28] <dakkar> aah, I was trying to figure out that `.Slip`

[08:29] <very> which seems more inefficient than a built-in `permuations($of)` but I guess there are reasons for not including it

[08:31] <dakkar> very: it would perform exactly the same operations… built-ins are not always magical ☺

[08:32] <very> but faster, I meant

[08:32] <dakkar> not necessarily

[08:32] <very> okay then

[08:32] <very> but there is sort at the end?

[08:33] <very> direct implementation wouldn't have that I believe

[08:33] <lizmat> if a builtin is not the fastest, it needs to be fixed  :-)

[08:36] *** dakkar left
[08:36] <moon-child> recently on a trivial benchmark (file reading) raku was 10x faster than common lisp.  Was because the cl implementation was doing something stupid, but still nice to see!

[08:36] <moon-child> then again, dispatch in raku is still 100x slower than cl.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[14:56] <[Coke]> ... is it too early for Halloween yard decorations? asking for a friend.

[14:56] <jdv> my wife says no

[14:57] <perryprog> yes

[14:57] <perryprog> literally not even October smh

[14:57] <jdv> october starts this week so i'd side with her

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> one months still seems a lot though

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> one month still seems a lot though

[15:00] <El_Che> it's always too early for Halloween decorations

[15:07] <jdv> looks like new-disp is about 5% slower on startup and 30% slower on core setting parse for me

[15:07] <jdv> uh, that's backwards

[15:08] <jdv> i meant 5% on parse and 30% on startup

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what's new-disp?

[15:12] <[Coke]> new branch of rakudo/nqp/MoarVM that changes the dispatch model

[15:12] <jdv> this is the way

[15:13] <[Coke]> Should be transparent to users and (by next release) should be faster (and have more options for optimization)

[15:14] <jdv> iirc its been mentioned many times in the weekly

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what ever "the weekly" is 😅 I can vaguely recall something from the conference though

[15:17] <[Coke]> most new development has been on that branch, hope to merge it back to primary branch shortly.
