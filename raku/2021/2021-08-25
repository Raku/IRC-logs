[15:43] <mjgardner> TIL about `unit sub`: https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/08/24/frenemies-part-2-what-a-difference-a-perl-module-makes/#comment-357
[15:43] <mjgardner> Unfortunately it is not documented: https://docs.raku.org/syntax/unit
[15:45] <mjgardner> Oops, correction, it is hidden here: https://docs.raku.org/language/create-cli#Unit-scoped_definition_of_MAIN
[15:47] <Altreus> ah, unit sub MAIN! interesting
[16:00] <mjgardner> I guess it saves an indent level, which would make Python devs itch. So it's a win there.
[16:04] <Altreus> I quite like that saving, but I feel like calling it an indent level is doing it a disservice
[16:05] <Altreus> It's more a concept level
[16:05] <Altreus> The indentation is happenstance: what actually go away are the block delimiters
[16:05] *** reportable6 joined
[16:06] <Altreus> So I guess the python devs would actually prefer it :D
[16:17] <cnx> python dev here, can confirm that flat is better than nested

[21:31] <gfldex> lizmat: I'm gonna ask Santa if we can borrow the multiverse branch slitter, so you can test your stuff in a non-production branch of reality.
[21:32] <gfldex> Whereby I'm not convinced anymore that *this* branch of reality was meant to be used in production.
[21:33] <perryprog> What's the worst is when someone runs the live branch of reality under lldb and it hits a breakpoint
[21:46] <ugexe> every action is already a multiverse branch splitter
[21:46] <ugexe> maybe a multiverse map reduce
[21:47] <gfldex> the checkout is the difficult part
[21:47] <gfldex> and there seams to be no revert
[21:47] <ugexe> oh a git branch, and not a multiverse branching event
