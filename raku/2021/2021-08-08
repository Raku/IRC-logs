[01:32] <[Coke]> out of curiosity, just checked how many lines of src/ are still blamed on me. 14 - 9 of them are blanks, 1 is a #comment, 3 others appear to be part of a multi-line comment, and the one line of real code... a whitespace change. :)

[04:53] <Xliff> Does anyone know how HOW types are exposed in Raku?

[04:53] <Xliff> Perl6::Metamodel::CoercionHOW is NOT something I can use, although it is something I can access.

[04:56] <moon-child> does raku have have an equivalent to cl's before/after methods?

[05:07] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[05:19] <timo> i dont know anything about cl really,  but perhaps the wrap method on a Routine instance is what youre looking for?

[05:22] <moon-child> hmm, somewhat

[05:22] <moon-child> http://ix.io/3vkO/perl6  I want to wrap only the second multi candidate

[05:26] <moon-child> (which sounds like a very strange thing to do; but really it's _adding_ a multi candidate which automatically does nextsame once it's done.  That would be a before method in cl.  There're also after methods, which run after primary dispatch (as the name suggests), but whose return values are ignored.  'wrap' seems more like 'around' but inhibits dispatch rather than augmenting it)

[06:08] <moon-child> jester: you might want to change your password

[06:08] <tellable6> moon-child, I'll pass your message to jester

[06:12] <moon-child> (side-note, the fact that that can happen is imo a flaw in the irc protocol.  Yes there's sasl, but it's not mandatory sooo verges on useless)

[08:20] <CIAvash> moon-child: depends on the function and its signature, but you can use `proto` like: `proto f ($x?) { if $x { say 'before'; } {*} }`

[08:29] *** slu joined
[08:34] *** Doc_Holliwood joined
[08:46] <CIAvash> or if you want to be more specific: `proto f (|c) {if c ~~ :($) {say 'before ', c[0];}; {*}};`

[09:12] *** El_Che joined

[09:22] <CIAvash> you can do the same thing with `wrap`: `&f.wrap: -> |c { say 'wrapper' if c ~~ :($); callsame }`

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hi! Is there a way to suppress messages issued with `note` ? Messages, issued with `warn` can be suppressed with `quietly`.

[11:17] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[11:57] <Altai-man> `note` writes to stderr, so technically you can assign $*ERR to something else maybe?

[12:02] *** reportable6 left
[12:04] *** reportable6 joined
[12:05] <CIAvash> there is `silently` module https://raku.land/cpan:ELIZABETH/silently

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Thank you @Altai-man -- I will study and experiment

[12:15] <CIAvash> I've been seeing a lot of bad errors recently, they were too much to report, but I probably should have done so

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @CIAvash -- I will try `silently`! Thanks!.

[19:03] <nine> At my level of Raku prowress I probably shouldn't enjoy such in-depth explanations of solutions of the weekly challenge so much. But I certainly do!

[19:04] <MasterDuke> it's a big enough language that exploring all the different ways of doing all the individual steps is fascinating
