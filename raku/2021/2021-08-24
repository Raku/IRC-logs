[08:40] <keutoi> Is there a reason this https://docs.raku.org/type/Metamodel::Documenting kind of documentation is not used within rakudo impelementation?

[08:41] <lizmat> keutoi ??

[08:42] <keutoi> m: say 1.WHY

[08:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5c74b4053: OUTPUT: ¬´No documentation available for type 'Int'.  Perhaps it can be found at‚ê§https://docs.raku.org/type/Int‚ê§¬ª

[08:42] <lizmat> Ah, that!

[08:43] <lizmat> that kind of documentation is not used in the setting because of bootstrapping issues

[08:43] <lizmat> well, historically anyway

[08:43] <keutoi> So using it within external modules is encouraged?

[08:44] <lizmat> yes!

[12:36] <tbrowder> i found what is to me a trap while porting some old perl code. i was trying to demo it above

[12:37] <tbrowder> the docs don't say a lot about qq quotes which i use a lot for file generation.

[12:38] <tbrowder> the code above works great in perl but the $a needs to be inside curly braces. the docs don't mention the simple case above but show various similar situations that don't require the braces

[12:39] <tbrowder> *needs to be inside curly braces in raku

[16:55] <Xliff> Is there any way to get the implementing class from a method?

[16:55] <Xliff> Especially if the method belongs to a role?

[16:56] <Xliff> m: role A { method this-one { 1; }; }; class B does A { }; A.^lookup('this-one').package.^name.say

[16:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5c74b4053: OUTPUT: ¬´A‚ê§¬ª

[16:57] <Xliff> I want a way that will report "B" 

[16:57] <Xliff> Especially if I can get the type object as opposed to the string.

[16:58] <Xliff> Above example isn't quite true to form.

[16:58] <Xliff> m: role A { method this-one { 1; }; }; class B does A { }; my &m = ('this-one'); &m.package.^name.say
