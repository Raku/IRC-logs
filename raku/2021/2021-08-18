[00:23] <[Coke]> should baghash have an .add that lets you specify a weight?

[00:24] <[Coke]> ah, you just treat $baghash<key> as a LHV. nevermind.

[00:26] <vrurg> [Coke]: I'd also try adding a Pair. It feels natural that it should work.

[00:28] <vrurg> m: my %h is BagHash; %h.add: :a(pi); say %h.raku

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu#1747> nevermind I was about to ask where is the new IRC server but I remembered it's indicated on raku.org/community/irc

[16:35] <Altreus> a new one?

[16:35] <Altreus> This confusion brought to you from libera.chat

[16:42] <grondilu> nah I meant new as opposed to freenode

[16:42] <grondilu> I only learned recently about the events there

[16:43] <[Coke]> ugh. if I have a 2D array, is there really no way to extract a row from it? (Everything I'm trying complains about partially dimensioned views except for a single cell)

[16:45] <grondilu> depends how you define your array.  IIRC there are quite a few ways to define one in raku

[16:46] <ugexe> @a[$row;*] ?

[16:47] <[Coke]> m: my @a[2;2] = [1,2;3,4]; dd @a[0;*]

[20:17] <moritz_> haven't tried it, but it's just a hash, no? you could bind a custom class to it that implements hash-y / associative interface

[20:27] <gfldex> It's a Seq in a Package.

[20:47] <gfldex> And World.nqp wants a nqp-hash at some point.

[22:22] <moon-child> 'Unlike ohmyzsh plugins, Tomtit plugins could be written not just on Bash'  I'm pretty sure that ohmyzsh plugins are written in ... zsh

[22:23] <melezhik> oh, good point, technically, many of them are Bash compatible, but to have an accurate statement, yeah, they are written on zsh, will update my post, thanks

[22:24] <melezhik> "Unlike ohmyzsh plugins which are written on Zshell, Tomtit plugins could be written on similar Bash and many other languages, supported by Sparrow ( on which the Tomtit is built on )" - is it better?
