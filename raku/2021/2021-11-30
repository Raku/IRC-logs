[05:32] <samebchase> I've been able to get this working using a topic variable, however my question is how do I create an inline lambda that takes in an arbitrary signature  
[05:34] <samebchase> meaning, if my sequence has a list of size-2 lists, I would like to do something like (SEQ-OF-SIZE-2-LISTS)>>.&{ ($a, $b) -> { say "$a, $b" }}
[05:36] <samebchase> [(1,2), (3,4)]>>.&{ <LAMBDA-BODY> }, what's the syntax of defining lambdas that work with hyper operators with the "." method call syntax
[05:40] *** nativecallable6 joined
[05:40] <samebchase> m: (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4)>>.&{ say $^a; };
[05:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6817f088: OUTPUT: «1␤3␤1␤4␤2␤3␤2␤4␤»
[05:40] <samebchase> how do I deal with the data as pairs and not flattened
[05:40] <samebchase> m:  (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4);
[05:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6817f088: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "X" in expression ".. 2 X 3 .." in sink context (line 1)␤»

[05:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6817f088: OUTPUT: «((1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4))␤»
[05:42] <samebchase> I want these "pairs" to be given the the lambda without flattening them, so 4 items, instead of 8 items.
[05:42] *** statisfiable6 joined
[05:44] <samebchase> "Whether hyperoperators descend into child lists depends on the nodality of the inner operator of a chain. For the hyper method call operator (».), the nodality of the target method is significant." from https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-hyper_%3C%3C-hyper_%3E%3E-hyper_%C2%AB-hyper_%C2%BB-Hyper_operators
[05:48] <samebchase> how do I define an inline lambda here, which does not force the hyper operator to not descend into an inner list?
[05:51] <samebchase> Something like:  (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4)>>.& -> ($a, $b) { say $a, $b }; where $a is 1 and $b is 3 on the first iteration
[05:56] <elcaro> samebchase: use .map
[05:56] <elcaro> (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4).map(-> ($a, $b) { ... })
[05:57] <elcaro> (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4).map: -> ($a, $b) { ... } # Alternate syntax
[05:59] <samebchase> elcaro: I understand `map` does that as it allows you to pass in a block. I was just wondering if there was a way to easily pass in arbitrary blocks with hyper operators. 
[06:00] <samebchase> I guess `map` is idiomatic here, and hyper operators are better off when the data is not nested. 
[06:00] <elcaro> you can't stop a hyper-operator from decending into children unless you explicitly specify the nodality, which you can really only do with a routine trait
[06:01] <elcaro> yeah, I personally think `».&` is an anti-pattern outside of golfing 
[06:02] *** reportable6 left
[06:03] <elcaro> m: sub f($xs) { $xs.elems }; sub g($xs) is nodal { $xs.elems }; say (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4)».&f; say (1 .. 2 X 3 .. 4)».&g
[06:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6817f088: OUTPUT: «((1 1) (1 1) (1 1) (1 1))␤(2 2 2 2)␤»
[06:04] <samebchase> my &f = sub ($a, $b) is nodal { say $a, $b }; followed by [(1,2),(3,4),]>>.&f; , but I still get the error "Too few positionals passed; expected 2 arguments but got 1"
[06:04] <elcaro> i don't think there's any way to say a lambda `is nodal` and even if there was, it would be noisier that just using `map`
[06:04] <samebchase> wait, let me see what you've just typed
[06:05] <elcaro> you sub is not receiving 2 arguments... it's receiving a list of 2 elems
[06:05] <samebchase> Ah, my function is expecting two args, 
[06:05] <samebchase> instead I need to destructure
[06:05] <elcaro> unless you unpack in the sub
[06:05] <samebchase> got it!
[06:05] <samebchase> thanks so much elcaro
[06:05] <elcaro> yeah like sub (@ [$a, $b]) { ... }
[06:06] <samebchase> tl;dr: Use map, and don't mess with "is nodal"
[06:06] *** swaggboi left
[06:07] <samebchase> Earlier, the use of ">>" as opposed to a map or a loop used to make me feel anxious, but now I think I'm overdoing hyperoperators in my quest to understand them.
[06:08] <elcaro> yeah, plus `».` is not lazy, so it's not always ideal for that reason
[06:09] <elcaro> I use them sparingly, usually to avoid map-inside-map, ie. I will typically prefer `*.map(*».foo)` over `*.map(*.map(*.foo))`

[15:47] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to tbrowder
[15:48] <melezhik> ^^ SmokeMachine - looks like was the only user of the web site?
[15:48] <melezhik> ^^ tbrowder
[15:49] <SmokeMachine> melezhik: really? sad news... :( I like that idea
[15:51] <tbrowder> melezhik: will do, sorry, you sure you want to shut it down? if it isn't hard to maintain or cost money, i would leave it up.
[15:52] <tbrowder> rakuuns, like other ppl, have desires that change all the time, so who knows when it might take off!
[15:52] <melezhik> SmokeMachine tbrowder sorry that I upset you , the site costs me some money - 30$ a months and I am not sure if there are any real users besides maybe SmokeMachine
[15:54] <tbrowder> oh, i'm not upset, just sorry it didn't flourish.
[15:54] <melezhik> my idea was to spin it off and then people would do comments, but realistically irc/reddit beat me here ))) 
[15:55] <melezhik> spin off -> launch 
[15:55] <tbrowder> if the code is available maybe i can run it on one of my servers
[15:56] <melezhik> for sure, code I can share the code ... but be aware - it is not optimal and very slow (  it needs a DB instead slow file system ) - and this is a one of the reasons it eats some resources
[15:56] <tbrowder> and reddit is not a place i visit often. maybe make yr site just for Raku modules and projects.
[15:57] <melezhik> but overall it's just a cro application with a state kept on the file system
[15:57] <melezhik> so if you want to give it a try I can make a GH public and you can fork , will it work?
[15:57] <jast> now I'm curious, what was the site about? can't access it so I assume it's already down
[15:59] <tbrowder> pls make it public (but sanitize appropriately)
[16:00] <tbrowder> gotta get back to my advent article...back later...
[16:00] <melezhik> tbrowder sure - do you mean to remove sensitive data ?
[16:01] <melezhik> jast I can switch it on real quick, if you are curious ...
[16:02] <jast> a one-line summary would do it, too :)
[16:02] <tbrowder> yes, passwords, contact data not made public already, etc., root user info...
[16:03] <melezhik> sure

[16:12] <jast> and (2) has plenty of sub-steps
[16:14] <jast> most of my projects stop getting updates somewhere in the middle of the first step
[16:15] *** rbt left
[16:15] <melezhik> yeah, I guess the concept stage is pretty much finished , the implementation part is still in progress, from my pint of view the site lacks real users who would do comments/news/updates 
[16:17] <jast> getting users is the hardest part ;)

[19:42] <tbrowder> yep, that's why the several young folks i know in the publicity world can make some big bucks/euros
[19:42] <[Coke]> me: "AIGH WHY IS ADVENT POSTING HAPPENING ALREADY". me: remembers time zones exist.
[19:43] <tbrowder> but they don't help s,
[19:43] <Nicholas> [Coke]: you mean there are time zones other than UGT? :-)
[19:43] <[Coke]> -1 for the explicit religious message at the end.
[19:44] <tbrowder> *small fish much...
[19:44] <[Coke]> my RSS feed shows me the article, but if I click to go to site, I get: https://raku-advent.blog/2021/11/30/santa-claus-is-rakuing-along/ which is a 404
[19:44] <tbrowder> [Coke] i just discovered unposting works!
[19:45] <[Coke]> ?? Why unpost?
[19:45] <[Coke]> I assumed it was on a schedule for Dec-01?
[19:45] <tbrowder> cause i hit the post button inadvertently
[19:45] <[Coke]> That'd do it
[19:45] <tbrowder> when i wasn't ready
[19:47] <tbrowder> i hate wordpress, menus are horrible and misleading, html entry is terribly non-standard...
[19:48] <lizmat> I wrote my blog post in markdown, committed it to github, copy-pasted the HTML representation, and was done  :-)
[19:48] <tbrowder> my article is there as draft with a scheduled post i think...something jj automated i think...
[19:49] <lizmat> my biggest beef with WP was that it didn't allow me to schedule the post to be published at midnight
[19:50] <lizmat> 0 was not acceptable as an hour indicator  :-(   It would revert to whatever it had before
[19:50] <tbrowder> i did it in pod and used Pod::To::HTML and inserted it into the code editor...had to remove the head part
[19:52] <[Coke]> I often do 12:01 or 11:59 to avoid shenanigans.
[19:52] <[Coke]> (not in this context in particular)
[19:55] <[Coke]> https://floooh.github.io/tiny8bit-preview/ ... played around on the C64 emulator a bit.

[21:12] <Skarsnik> Hello
[21:14] <Skarsnik> Do I still need to use eval to add a token dynamicly to a grammar?
[21:14] *** rbt left
[21:15] *** rbt joined
[21:21] <ugexe> grammar Foo { token TOP { <foo> } }; role Bar { token foo { \w+ } }; my $g = Foo.new but Bar;
[21:23] <Skarsnik> I am talking more about .^add_method x)

[21:53] <Ergo444> hi
[21:54] <Ergo444> HOw can I set a category for a package
[21:54] <Ergo444> in raku directory
[21:56] *** squashable6 joined
[21:59] <Skarsnik> I do $grmr.^add_method("instruction:sym<$token-name>", EVAL 'token {"' ~ $instruct.inst.lc ~ '"}'); but when I list the methods of the grammar all the token have no names.
[21:59] <Skarsnik> but if I add the name of the token in the EVAL I got an error

[22:21] <[Coke]> .
[22:29] <Skarsnik> ah it's fun, ^methods on grammar give you the contents of the grammar x)
[22:30] <Skarsnik> the issue EVAL does not let me have the name of the token :(
[22:33] <Skarsnik> Ok, need to add my in front of token. *talk to himself*
[22:47] <tbrowder> lizmat: you still here?
[22:48] <Skarsnik> Hm, I have another issue, I need to inherit from my generated grammar in another one (static) but... that it can't find the generated type :(
[23:05] *** patrickb left
[23:07] <tbrowder> well, i used lizmat's method. it works sort of, best so far, though.  but not all pod get's translated well to markdown, so still had to edit one list item that should have been a code block
[23:08] <tbrowder> has any Mac user tried "MarsEdit" for offline Wordpress blogs?
[23:09] <tbrowder> or, shudder, any win ppl used MS Word? for offline Wordpress blogs?
