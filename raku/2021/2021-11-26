[13:50] <tbrowder> lizmat: hi, are you now using mi6 for fez?

[13:51] <lizmat> yes

[13:51] <lizmat> add [UploadToZef] to your dist.ini file

[13:51] <tbrowder> can you write a little blurp for

[13:51] <tbrowder> ,

[13:52] <lizmat> and adapt the auth your class statement

[13:53] <tbrowder> ...i thought there was some issue about fez not respecting versions or something similar...

[13:53] <lizmat> ?  not sure what you mean

[13:55] <tbrowder> i'll have to look back but tonyo i thought said something about not checking ver bewtween META6 and the auth line in the main lib module

[13:56] *** squashable6 left
[13:56] <lizmat> fwiw, all of my modules have been uploaded with mi6 to zef for the past month or so

[13:57] <tbrowder> ok, sounds good. so you are first uploading to fez and then removing from cpan?

[13:58] <tbrowder> or wating for some period before removal?

[13:58] *** squashable6 joined
[14:00] <lizmat> I haven't really removed my modules from CPAN yet

[14:00] <lizmat> still working on a "backpan" like content provider

[14:01] <lizmat> the content is already saved, btw

[14:01] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/REA#readme

[14:08] <tbrowder> cool, so i should, for each of my pub module repos do these 2 things: add the upload line to dist.ini, change auth line in module namesake module.

[14:09] <tbrowder> but how is email handled?

[14:12] <lizmat> you need a fez login

[14:13] <lizmat> it will be sent to the email address you specify when you register

[14:13] <lizmat> but only if something went wrong (no news is good news)

[14:17] <tbrowder> one

[14:19] <tbrowder> does fez create a dot file in one's home directory?

[14:19] <lizmat> I think it does

[14:19] <tbrowder> thanks!

[14:19] <lizmat> .fez-config.json

[14:24] <jjatria> El_Che: you mean search by license in raku.land?

[14:26] <jjatria> lizmat: wow... that change you made pointing AI::FANN to my repo in the github ecosystem means there is now a "release" of my WIP :(

[14:27] <lizmat> no, that's a consequence of github redirecting  :-(

[14:27] <lizmat> I ran into that myself with IRC::Client  :-(

[14:27] <lizmat> releasing a version to CPAN or zef should fix that

[14:27] <jjatria> Unfortunate... Oh well: I guess I'll have to bump to 0.2.0 when the time comes :D 

[14:28] <lizmat> (with a higher version)

[14:28] <lizmat> indeed

[14:28] <jjatria> Thanks for the clarification

[14:28] <jjatria> Incidentally, does anyone know of any examples of passing a callback from Raku to C using NativeCall? I'm struggling to figure out the wiring

[14:28] <lizmat> if I hadn't changed it in the ecosystem, Github would still redirect  and produce the same effect

[14:29] <lizmat> I'd rather be explicit in that respect

[14:29] <jjatria> Yeah, no worries. It's just another reason to move away from the Github eco, IMHO

[14:29] <jjatria> It just caught me by surprise :)

[14:30] <lizmat> it did me as well  :-(

[15:15] <tbrowder> yo, someone needs to make an advent article on Telegram! @jj, among others, has contributed to it and it has a "Perl" bot example (really in "Perl6" which should be changed to "Raku").

[15:19] *** Kaiepi left
[15:21] <tbrowder> i haven't looked at it since it was first announced in 2013 but it looks interesting for my class website to replace the old twitter msg for announcements

[15:27] <tbrowder> i do have a .fez* from my original regis, but it doesn't show the email i used.

[15:28] <tbrowder> i assume fez doesn't send out that email anywhere else.

[15:29] <lizmat> I only have a ~/.fez-config.json

[15:30] <lizmat> maybe ugexe  or tonyo can enlighten

[16:45] <atroxaper> Hello, #raku !

[16:49] *** sm1 left
[16:49] <tbrowder> lizmat: that's ok. two more questions ref zef/fez: 1. did you get the autoincrease in version number when you published to fez/zef? 2. can you point to or briefly describe use of fez/zef as opposed to cpan (i am finishing a pr to mi6 describing all this)?

[16:49] <atroxaper> Does anybody meet an issue with Rakudo on the last macOS Monterey? Rakudo randomly does stuck in runtime. Without high CPU usage or any visible reason or clues. Even on 'zef install ...' or any other scripts. Rakudo v2021.09, v2021.10

[16:51] <lizmat> atroxaper: there are several reports about various problems on Monterey afaik

[16:51] <lizmat> mi6 takes care of the versioning, fez just uploads what it is told by mi6

[16:52] <lizmat> apart from the changes in the auth and dist.ini, there are no differences wrt to mi6 

[16:52] <atroxaper> lizmat: A read the last Weekly about that on M1 mac. There are knows issues even on x86?

[16:53] <lizmat> yes, afaik... something with NativeCall I believe, Monterey being stricter on what is allowed to link against ?

[16:54] <atroxaper> Grrr... I would help with that if I can.

[16:55] <lizmat> normally I would have been on Monterey already, but Apple basically froze me on Mojave because otherwise all of my media workflows won't work anymore  :-(

[16:56] <lizmat> so I'm also seriously considering moving to Debian or so for my next notebook

[16:57] <lizmat> Apple appears to want to get rid of anything that's not strictly in the Apple garden

[16:57] <atroxaper> Sorry about that...

[17:00] <lizmat> why should you be sorry about that?  :-)_

[17:07] <atroxaper> lizmat: As I understand in English that means that I feel sad about your problems and annoyance, for example :-)

[17:07] <Altreus> Apple doesn't fall far from the tree

[17:08] <Altreus> atroxaper: you might say "Sorry to hear that", but "sorry about that" means it's your fault :D

[17:09] <atroxaper> Oh... Lost in Translation. Thank you ^^

[17:30] <tbrowder> i just pushed a pr to https://github.com/skaji/mi6 readme and would appreciate some more eyeballs on it. i tried to keep skaji's format with his FAQ style.

[17:31] <tbrowder> the change is to help us semi-reluctant mi6 users move to fez/zef from cpan

[17:35] <atroxaper> tbrowder: Looks good for me. At least I have no appeared additional questions about moving to fez after read your changes.

[20:19] <tbrowder> i have removed my ~/.pause file and moved my [UploadToZef] entry to the top of the dist.ini file but no change.

[20:19] <lizmat> did you put the [UploadToZef] in the dist.ihi ?

[20:19] <tbrowder> yes

[20:20] <lizmat> hmmm

[20:20] <lizmat> maybe my local mi6 version is more different than I thought  ..

[20:21] <lizmat> could you clone the App::Mi6 repo, and force install from there?

[20:21] <tbrowder> i have removed all references to cpan in current files except the git refs still show cpan

[20:22] <tbrowder> the current mi6 repo has changed its "master" branch to "main".

[20:22] <tbrowder> i had to kill my fork of App::Mi6 and refork

[20:23] <tbrowder> i have not killed my mi6 zef installation but maybe i should and reinstall...
