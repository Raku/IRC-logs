[00:22] <elcaro> tbrowder: It's still not clear what your doing without an example... you have a list of things that are numbers in various formats, and your trying to parse them to a Numeric type?
[00:24] <elcaro> also, one limitation of the radix literal syntax is, well... that it requires a "literal". you can't do `:$base<$str>`. for when you need a variable base, there's `$str.parse-base($base)`
[00:27] <tbrowder>  i understand. i just need a list of numbers that are not pure strings but retain their number type even as a  string. the <<>> do that for all formats it seem.
[00:37] <elcaro> Could you use allomorphs?
[00:38] <elcaro> m: say my $x = RatStr.new(:16<10.1>, '0x10.1'); say +$x

[12:15] <rassoc> raiph states the following in one of those links: "In Raku, Int denotes what PLs like Swift mean by Int?. The rationale is that object types should incorporate type safety by default without requiring a blizzard of ?s." 
[12:16] <rassoc> how is that true? crystal, rust and swift enforce these null-checks at compile-time, don't they? How does raku come close to this?
[12:24] <moritz> it doesn't
[12:54] <tbrowder> howdy, rakoons
[12:57] <tbrowder> i just put up a short article on a proposed 'modf' routine for the raku core on the rakudo wiki. its link is in the list in the brief menu on the right side entitled 'Modf routine'.
[12:58] <tbrowder> i would appreciate critical reviews and changes to that.
[13:01] <tbrowder> i have successfully moved my ongoing implementation of that from the 6.c to the 6.e release side of the rakudo master branch, and i will be implementing the user interface as i describe on the wiki.
