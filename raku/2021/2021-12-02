[19:36] <Ergo444> hi

[19:36] <Ergo444> How can I add a new module?

[19:37] <lizmat> a module such as App::Mi6 does a lot of the work for you

[19:37] <lizmat> then, when you're ready, get a login on the zef ecosystem

[19:37] <lizmat> and then run "mi6 release"

[19:37] <lizmat> basically in a nutshell  :-)

[19:38] <Ergo444> Why would I need App:Mi6?

[19:38] <lizmat> you don't need it

[19:38] <lizmat> but it makes life so much easier  :-)

[19:40] <Ergo444> is there difference between any(@s) !=6

[19:41] <Ergo444> and all(@s)!=6

[19:41] <lizmat> m: say so any(1,2,6) != 6

[19:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 78ce830c3: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[19:42] <lizmat> yeah... != is a bit tricky with junctions.. there has been some debate about that

[19:42] *** rbt left
[19:44] <Ergo444> well, I used it in the code

[19:45] <lizmat> can you rephrase it in such a way that it uses == ?

[19:46] <Ergo444> one(@s)!=6

[19:46] <Ergo444> m: say one(1,2,6)!=6

[20:37] <tonyo> Ergo444: stuff only gets fixed if bugs get reported

[20:38] <Ergo444> read this conversation.... https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/141#issuecomment-983696562

[20:39] <tonyo> what's that to do with fez?

[20:42] <Ergo444> nothing, but it has to do with that bugs I am not always fixed

[20:42] <Ergo444> even if they are reported

[20:43] <tonyo> not reporting guarantees it won't get fixed.  meta.list is eventually going away

[20:45] <tonyo> Ergo444: are you jaffa4?

[20:45] <Ergo444> same

[20:47] <tonyo> put it on meta.list then

[20:47] <Ergo444> I have already done so.
