[01:19] <colemanx> Regarding the call for infra volunteers, I thought I'd share this note on reddit: https://envs.sh/A3  (shortened link)

[01:20] <colemanx> Rust has good docs around that stuff, imo

[01:43] <Xliff> bda: Although you've probably already figured this out, given "token type { | <fp> | <integer> | <complex> }", you would want "method type ($/) { $/.values[0].made }"

[01:43] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to bda

[02:12] <Xliff> Is there another browseable resource for IRC logs aside from colabti?

[02:21] <japhb> Xliff: logs.liz.nl

[02:22] <japhb> (Though I doubt that's a permanent location)

[02:34] <Xliff> japhb++

[02:35] <Xliff> Another thing: Does Test::is-deeply consider that comparing hashes means accounting for different key order?

[02:35] <Xliff> I have a failing test in a Raku module that suffers from this and is making a false failure.

[02:37] <Xliff> japhb++

[02:37] <Xliff> Oh, nevermind. I missed an addition I made. LOL

[09:15] <patrickb> [Coke]: Re repo for the CI bot grant. I haven't published it yet. I will definitely do so, but didn't bother because the thing itself doesn't run yet (it passes a lot of tests though). If you're interested, I can publish what I currently have.

[13:10] <[Coke]> Please don't just on my account.

[13:10] <[Coke]> but thanks if you do!

[13:13] <patrickb> [Coke]: I'm very fine with pushing things online. I just didn't bother up to now. But given someone actually looks at it, I'm more than willing to put it online ASAP. If you spot things you'd do differently, do tell, I'm very interested in feedback.

[13:13] <[Coke]> (y)

[13:13] <[Coke]> ... I need a macro for irssi that converts that into a thumbs up. )

[13:13] <[Coke]> :)

[13:13] <patrickb> I got it anyways. :-)

[13:39] <Altreus> Stuart Mackintosh was happy to have me livestream dev work. It was open source but not TPF, but there's definitely sentiment on the board in favour of developing publicly

[19:45] <[Coke]> I have a raku script that is calling out to git a few thousand times over a few dozen repos. any suggestions on speeding it up?

[19:48] <[Coke]> (some of these repos have thousands of branches, and I have to do a rev-parse, merge-base, and show in each one) Using run ono each of the calls, then out.slurp(:close).trim to get the output from the run.

[19:49] <[Coke]> I guess step one might be to at least ||ize the x git calls done for a single branch (and maybe more)

[19:50] <[Coke]> looked for a git module, but it looks like everything in the ecosystem is a bit old/undone.

[19:52] *** squashable6 left
[19:52] <lizmat> set up in such a way that you can .race it ?

[19:54] <MasterDuke> directly use a Proc::Async?

[20:05] *** ufobat left
[20:27] <[Coke]> old code was using indir to run the git command in the right place - does indir( -> {... Proc::Async }) work? (doesn't look like it)

[20:29] <ugexe> i dont understand the need for `indir` since you can just pass `run` :CWD

[20:31] <[Coke]> Sure; that worked as well; but Proc::Async doesn't seem to support either.

[20:31] <ugexe> it does

[20:31] <[Coke]> ah, in start.

[20:32] <ugexe> whenever $proc.start(:$ENV, :$cwd) { }

[20:41] <patrickb> <[Coke]>: There we go: https://github.com/Raku/RakuCIBot

[20:42] <[Coke]> patrickb: Danke

[22:28] <pony> yay

[22:29] <joeyxl> do you like it? 

[22:29] <pony> yeah :)

[22:30] <joeyxl> cool :)

[22:30] <joeyxl> is it good language to start with?

[22:30] <joeyxl> or am i getting myself into somthing advanced?

[22:32] <pony> shouldn't be a problem, nah

[22:32] <pony> I don't think picking a first language matters as much as people think

[22:33] <pony> as long as it's something you like

[22:33] <joeyxl> yeah i agree
