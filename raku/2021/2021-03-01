[09:29] <abraxxa> I've just updated my raku from the new cloudsmith repo after wondering why I don't get any updates. Now zef weils because it can't write to the raku directory: Failed to create directory '/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/short' with mode '0o777': Failed to mkdir: Permission denied

[09:30] <El_Che> mmm

[09:31] <El_Che> can you rm -rf .raku .perl and run /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user

[09:31] <abraxxa> in my home dir?

[09:31] <abraxxa> I don't have a ~/.perl dir

[09:32] <abraxxa> same error messages when running /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user

[09:32] <El_Che> sorry

[09:33] <El_Che> .perl6

[09:33] <abraxxa> don't have that either

[09:33] <abraxxa> I guess I have cleaned that up already

[09:33] <El_Che> .raku is the most recent one used by zef

[09:33] <El_Che> which zef

[09:33] <abraxxa> /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/zef

[09:33] <El_Che> ok

[09:33] <El_Che> that only works are root

[09:34] <El_Che> maybe I need to add a note

[09:34] <abraxxa> it did work as user before

[09:34] <El_Che> /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user installs a local zef

[09:34] <El_Che> in .raku/bin

[09:34] <abraxxa> that fails with the same error message

[09:34] <El_Che> that one has rw access to your home\

[09:34] <El_Che> /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user then

[09:34] <El_Che> .raku/bin/zef

[09:35] <El_Che> you can add it t oyour path later

[09:35] <abraxxa> when I run /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user it fails with the same error message

[09:35] <El_Che> ah the script failes you mean?

[09:35] <abraxxa> yes

[09:36] <El_Che> oh, that's annoying

[09:37] <abraxxa> python precomplies all included py files on installation

[09:38] <El_Che> zef gives terrible advise, chmod 777

[09:38] <abraxxa> maybe the raku package can do the same

[09:38] <El_Che> I am looking if something changed in zef

[09:38] <abraxxa> thanks!

[09:38] <abraxxa> zef --version gives v0.11.4 after all those errors

[09:39] <El_Che> on my install the erros are cosmetic, but zef does work

[09:39] <El_Che> is it also in your case?

[09:39] *** aborazmeh_ left
[09:40] <El_Che> abraxxa: what distro are you using?

[09:41] *** aborazmeh joined
[09:41] <abraxxa> after the list of errors it says

[09:41] <abraxxa> All candidates are currently installed

[09:41] <abraxxa> No reason to proceed. Use --force-install to continue anyway

[09:41] <abraxxa> Don't forget to add '~/.raku/bin' to your PATH,

[09:41] <abraxxa> e.g. by adding this to .profile:

[09:41] <abraxxa> export PATH=~/.raku/bin:$PATH

[09:42] <abraxxa> but .raku/bin is empty

[09:42] <abraxxa> Ubuntu 20.10

[09:42] <El_Che> find .raku -name "zef"

[09:42] <abraxxa> nothing

[09:42] <El_Che> of system zef then

[09:43] <El_Che> looking at it now

[09:53] <abraxxa> I've tried purging and reinstalling rakudo-pkg, didn't change anything

[09:53] <El_Che> I have a radical fix, but it's the correct one

[09:53] <El_Che> zef is confused about root and user install

[09:54] <El_Che> I'll remove root zef and make the install-zef-as-user script smarter

[09:54] *** sena_kun left
[09:54] <El_Che> now install-zef-as-user uses zef to install the user's zef

[09:54] <abraxxa> I'd let zef always save the precomp files in a per user directory instead of rakudo directory

[09:54] <El_Che> sonmething changed in upstream rakudo (or zef)

[09:55] <El_Che> but it was a source of confusion anyways

[09:59] <El_Che> new packages will be up very soon

[10:00] <El_Che> testing to making sure nothing breaks

[10:02] <El_Che> should have done it ages ago, but it's the first time zef breaks (for some people)

[10:02] <El_Che> not really break, just complains :) 

[10:02] <sena_kun> El_Che, details?

[10:03] <El_Che> sena_kun: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/issues/78

[10:04] <El_Che> by adapting how zef is installing by the user, we won't see that problem any more

[10:04] <sena_kun> Oh, this is not cool.

[10:04] <sena_kun> But I think it was not introduced by a point, was it?

[10:04] <El_Che> and it makes more sense anyway, because people are confused by root zef and user zef all the time

[10:04] <sena_kun> Ah, it dates back to 2018.

[10:04] <El_Che> fixing it once and for all

[10:04] <sena_kun> El_Che++

[10:05] <El_Che> sena_kun: I only saw it with 2020.12

[10:05] <El_Che> and not always

[10:05] <sena_kun> El_Che, still not something that calls for another point.

[10:05] <El_Che> I thought it was fixed once the cached was cleaned up

[10:05] <El_Che> sena_kun: no, not created by the latest release

[10:05] <sena_kun> OTOH I won't be able to make it anyway, not sure how many times I can do it again at all.

[10:06] <El_Che> and the package workaround will fix the confusion anyway 

[10:06] <El_Che> so sidestepping the bug

[21:01] <vrurg> codesections: Oops, I meant the roast PR. Let me re-check.

[21:01] <codesections> Do you mean roast 719?

[21:01] <vrurg> Yeap, that one. Sorry.

[21:01] <codesections> oh, ok, will do

[21:01] <vrurg> Just copied wrong thing

[21:02] * vrurg is leaving. Will be back in few hours.

[21:02] *** vrurg left
[21:02] <codesections> (I'd seen some Roast PRs that just referenced the feature under test, so I thought that was the practice)

[21:02] <codesections> Thanks for letting me know!
