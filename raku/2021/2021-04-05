[00:08] <tbrowder> lizmat: i'm working on having DateTime.posix be a real number but it's causing 17 test failures in roast and i'm not sure if i want to (or can) continue. what i can do is mark the tests that fail for any future try at it. i could also just add a new 'posix-*' method (where * is some reasonable word for it) returning a real number and add some simple tests for it.

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: Insert missing target into Proc #3841

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: 

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: `Type/Independent-routines` contains a reference to `Proc#sub_run` but `Type/Proc` does not contain any target for `run`.

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: 

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: So I have inserted a X<> around the first explanation of `run` in Proc. This provides a target for Independent-routines (also opening separate PR with new target)

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: 

[20:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-2: BUT, for consistency, `run` should be listed as sub along with `new` and `shell`. Also relationship with new should be illustrated. This is not done in this PR.

[21:08] <perli> Hi. Can somebody reproduce this? https://paste.debian.net/hidden/ec73d799/

[21:08] <perli> I'm trying to install the ORM library Red

[21:09] <perli> Raku v2021.03

[21:11] <MasterDuke> you might need whatever the -dev(el) libraries are for postrgress for your os

[21:11] <MasterDuke> e.g., something like libpostgres-dev

[21:12] <MasterDuke> that's my drive-by troubleshooting attempt, i'm off...

[21:12] <perli> Oh, right. That works, thx

[21:18] <japhb> perli: FWIW, that's why the MUGS README files specify excluding that dependency if using zef to install: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS#synopsis -- MUGS doesn't use Postgres (at the moment, at least), it's just using SQLite.

[21:18] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to perli
