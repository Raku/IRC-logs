[08:07] <whatnext> hello all:)  I have a question about the mi6 tool

[08:08] <japhb> Is there an idiom for an idle/default task within a react block?  Meaning that I want all other `whenever` blocks to have priority, but if the react loop has no other `whenever` triggering, I want it to run my default block.  Hopefully that makes sense ...

[08:08] <whatnext> I am trying to run `mi6 release` and I get the error `Step 2 CheckOrigin: You should set git remote first`

[08:08] <whatnext> my question is, set it to what? and how to do that?

[08:09] <japhb> The actual use case is an action game main loop that wants to render a new frame whenever it is *not* currently processing user input, network messages, etc., but very importantly *not if it is already rendering a frame*, and without setting a fixed frame rate with e.g. Supply.interval.

[08:09] *** whatnext22 joined
[08:10] <japhb> whatnext: If you run `git remote -v` what does it say?

[08:13] *** whatnext left
[08:14] <whatnext22> @japhb sorry my connection dropped out - now apparently I am whatnext22:)  If I run `git remote -v` nothing happens - I haven't initialised a git repo at all as I wasn't aware this needed to be done. Maybe there are docs somewhere that I am missing?

[08:14] <lizmat> ah, good point

[08:14] <lizmat> I guess mi6 could do the "git init" for you

[08:15] <lizmat> but you'd need to add a repo somewhere on a place like github to make it work for you

[08:15] *** whatnext joined
[08:15] <japhb> Oh I see.  Yeah, if you had created the project with `mi6 new Module::Name`, then among other things it initializes it as a git repo, with all the template files waiting in the index for your first commit.

[08:15] <lizmat> ah, yes, of course, it does :-)

[08:16] <lizmat> when you create a new repo on github, it will tell you what to do to link your local repo to the remote on Github

[08:16] <japhb> But for release you still need to do as lizmat mentions and create an upstream somewhere, e.g. GitHub, and set your git remote there

[08:16] <japhb> Right, lizmat++

[08:16] <lizmat> and also, you'd need a login on PAUSE as well

[08:17] <lizmat> I don't think mi6 support uploading to the zef ecosystem yet, does it?  japhb ?

[08:17] <japhb> Until mi6 support for fez is merged ... :-)

[08:17] <lizmat> right

[08:17] <whatnext> Ah really. I did create it using `mi6 new Module::Name` - also I do have a PAUSE login

[08:17] <japhb> Not that I know of, no.

[08:18] <japhb> OK, if you do `git status` in that directory, you should see all the files waiting to be committed

[08:18] <whatnext> I see it is indeed a git repo - but `git remote -v` doesn't return anything

[08:18] *** whatnext22 left
[08:18] <japhb> whatnext: It won't until you have somewhere to push to.

[08:18] *** b2gills left
[08:18] <whatnext> I guess that is my question - what do I need to set it to?

[08:18] <japhb> Basically mi6 doesn't want you to release something that people can't fork

[08:19] <japhb> Do you have a github account?

[08:19] <whatnext> ok I see - so I need to put the project on github

[08:19] <whatnext> got it

[08:19] <whatnext> I was thinking it wanted some kind of remote on cpan

[08:19] <japhb> (It doesn't have to be GitHub in particular, that's just the most common choice of Rakoons so far.)

[08:19] <japhb> Nope.  :-)

[08:20] <whatnext> ok thanks - I'll try that :)

[08:20] *** cog_ joined
[08:20] <japhb> Good luck!  Let us know if you have any other questions.  :-)

[08:20] <whatnext> thanks :)

[08:34] <PimDaniel> \o

[08:35] <PimDaniel> Is there a workarround for this: Circular module loading detected trying to precompile /home/moi/raku/trylib/CharCons.rakumod ?

[08:38] <PimDaniel> I get a Line Class made of Point(s) (class) but class Point is into another module for some reasons. And the problem is that point MUST refer to Line also. so Point Class need to import the module where Line class is defined. This is a wellknown problem.

[08:40] <PimDaniel> The simpler solution would be to put Points into the same module tha Line is but i shared it because of the size and other tricks.

[08:41] <PimDaniel> So i just ask in the case it would exist a simple solution to resolve this. I red this was considered like a bug. I do not pretend it is still.

[08:43] <lizmat> PimDaniel: are you aware of stubbing ?

[08:44] <PimDaniel> lizmat: hello! No , i'm not aware! Sorry!

[08:44] <lizmat> m: class A { ... }; class B is A { method foo() { dd } }; class A { method bar() { dd } }; B.foo; B.bar

[08:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤'B' cannot inherit from 'A' because 'A' isn't composed yet (maybe it is stubbed)␤at <tmp>:1␤»

[08:44] <lizmat> hmmm

[08:45] <lizmat> m: class A { ... }; class B { method foo() { A.bar } }; class A { method bar() { dd } }; B.foo

[08:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «method bar(A: *%_)␤»

[08:45] <lizmat> that's more what you need, no 

[08:45] <lizmat> ?

[08:48] <PimDaniel> lizmat Thank you : i must understand... i'm not fast, sorry.

[08:54] <PimDaniel> lizmat: You declared 2 times class A {} how can this work?

[08:54] <lizmat> the first time I stubbed it

[08:55] <lizmat> that's the meaning of the ... inside the body of the class

[08:55] <lizmat> it tells the compiler: there's going to be a class A defined, but not now

[08:55] <lizmat> it allows you to refer to the class, without it actually have been built yet

[08:56] <lizmat> not that in class B in my example, method foo calls method bar in class A

[08:56] <lizmat> *before* that method is actually defined

[08:56] <lizmat> because method calling is late bound (aka the lookup for the method happens at runtime)

[08:56] <lizmat> this can work

[08:57] <PimDaniel> lizmat ok ok so i need to go further to well understand and to see how implement this in my code.

[08:58] <lizmat> I'm not sure it is the solution to your problem, but it may help you figure out a way to do what you want :-)

[09:01] <PimDaniel> lizmat in my case : i've class A and B in =! Modules and B is a composition of A let's say A is Point(s) : B is Line, but i do not know the side you chose so it may be the oposite. I must to check this more to understand and i'll come back if i struggle. Thank you very mutch!

[09:33] <PimDaniel> lizmat: I'm unable to say if your answer replies to my problem at this step. My problem should be tested with true files and modules not foo/bar into a simple inline. Foo/Bar means nothing for me even if wee see it everywhere it does not correspond to any reality: In real live you sometimes and may be often have classes that have relations between them eg : Point and Line one is a composition of the other.

[09:35] <lizmat> so the file with Line, does a "use Point" ?

[09:35] <lizmat> and you also want to do a "use Line" in the file that has Point ?

[09:36] <PimDaniel> I should probably make a paste to explicit my need more.

[09:36] <lizmat> yes, and please as short as possible  :-)

[09:36] <whatnext> hello again:)  I am still working on `mi6 release` - now I am down to `Step 8. UploadToCPAN` which is progress

[09:36] <lizmat> if anything, it will help your own thoughts get straight

[09:37] <lizmat> whatnext: you probably need a ~/.pause file with your PAUSE credentials ?

[09:37] <PimDaniel> lizmat of course a reduced representation but it's not a problem.

[09:38] <whatnext> however, I am getting `401 Unauthorized` - I have the user/password in a `.pause` file in my home dir and have logged in manually to PAUSE using the same to make sure they are correct - but still I have the error

[09:39] <whatnext> lizmat - thanks yes I have done that already, but I still get the 401

[09:40] <moritz> Hi all. I'm not updating the perl6-all-modules repository anymore, because it requires too much maintenance. If anybody wants to take over, please tell me soon; otherwise I'll delete that repo

[09:46] <PimDaniel> lizmat  YESS The file with line does a use Screen Module which contains Point class and just anothe one.  The problem is that class Point MUST refer to Line : a kind of indexation to refer which lines a point belongs too for example, then Screen Module MUST import CharCons module where Class Line is defined and it is a circular import because CharCons yet imports Screen where Point class is defined. I

[10:35] <whatnext20> I am not sure if my last message got through, so I'll try again  - I did figure out the mi6 issue in the end.

If I replace special chars in the password with the `%...` equivalent it works

[15:58] <PimDaniel> Altreus C'est gentil mais je pense que je ne m'en sort pas trop mal.

[15:59] <PimDaniel> Altreus Mon problème n'est pas là pour l'instant.

[16:00] <tonyo> PimDaniel: you can probably also do circulars with `require`

[16:00] <PimDaniel> To everybody: Is there a dedicated paste place for this Raku chat?

[16:01] <Altreus> I have been using github gists

[16:01] <PimDaniel> tonyo thank you for sure i think there is one : that is what i was wondering.

[16:02] <PimDaniel> Okay so i'll use pastebin like i did yet.

[16:02] <tonyo> gist or pastebin is what most use

[16:03] <Altreus> I think I solved the circular issue by simply removing all mentions of the other class :D

[16:03] <Altreus> In this project everything is done by a single object anyway so it wasn't a problem

[16:04] <antononcube> @PimDaniel Try the Raku discord channel/server.

[16:05] <PimDaniel> Right but before all may you look at the question here, and please read everything? https://pastebin.com/ruZbL7ya

[16:05] <Altreus> That's here if you want https://discord.gg/gg2a3T6

[16:06] <PimDaniel> Altreus ok that you for the link.

[16:07] *** parabolize joined
[16:09] <PimDaniel> Altreus what is discord? I do not create accounts of a site of what i do not know what it is!

[16:09] <Altreus> If you don't have Discord then you would probably not benefit from this link :)

[16:09] <Altreus> it's just another chat medium

[16:13] <PimDaniel> Okay, very intresting but i'll not do this now, plus : does discord work in irssi: Linux Ascii Native Console? I like trivial old fashion apps (for PC) because the are allways or quite are fast and they don't piss me off.

[16:15] <PimDaniel> Altreus: Are there more users and activity on Discord than here?

[16:16] <Altreus> no :D

[16:17] <Altreus> to any of those

[16:19] *** antononcube left
[16:19] <PimDaniel> onyo do you have a solution to my need  https://pastebin.com/ruZbL7ya with require? 

[16:19] <PimDaniel> tonyo do you have a solution to my need  https://pastebin.com/ruZbL7ya with require? 

[16:30] <PimDaniel> I fill there are many solutions as a workaround for circular dependencies but i fear many of them would lead to anarchy. I need to keep my code clear and simple.

[16:31] <tonyo> why do you need `Line @belong` in Point ?

[16:32] <tonyo> PimDaniel: ^

[16:33] <tonyo> i don't see the use case for @belong in that example

[16:33] <PimDaniel> I need to know which Line(s) a point belongs too.

[16:34] *** brtastic1 joined
[16:35] <Altreus> it is possible to just put `has @belong`

[16:35] <PimDaniel> tonyo I need to know which Line(s) a point belongs too. Is it shocking

[16:35] <Altreus> This was my solution :D

[16:35] <tonyo> just make it a generic

[16:35] *** brtastic left
[16:35] *** brtastic1 is now known as brtastic

[16:36] <tonyo> it is shocking to think that a point will only ever belong to a Line

[16:36] *** dakkar left
[16:37] <tonyo> what about later when four of them comprise a Rect ?

[16:37] <PimDaniel> tonyo A Point may belong (Touch) one or more Lines

[16:38] <tonyo> you wouldn't deduce that without knowing all of the lines to get points from in your example which makes @belongs a bit moot

[16:38] <PimDaniel> Into a Rect: each corner Point refer to 2 Lines. What is the problem?

[16:39] <tonyo> How do you know which Rect they belong to?

[16:39] *** mowcat joined
[16:39] <moritz> if you store all four corners, you could have contradictory information

[16:39] <PimDaniel> Into a crux it refers to 2 at 4 lines : but it depends how we consider Lines of course.

[16:40] <moritz> also, many rectangle implementations assume that it's aligned in a certain way; that might only make sense if you have also access to rotations

[16:40] <tonyo> you don't need to keep track of the lines a point belongs to, you already know all of the lines and therefore the points

[16:41] <Altreus> You could also have class Corner { has Line $line1; has Line $line2; has Point $common }

[16:41] <tonyo> what is the Point going to do with the parent info?

[16:41] <PimDaniel> moritz I need to mention i work in rectilinear plan. I just have horizontal and vertical lines.

[16:42] <PimDaniel> Altreus You idea is may be good.

[16:42] <Altreus> I think you are better off modelling it as class Line { has Point $point1; has Point $point2 }

[16:42] <Altreus> Now if you transform either Point you transform the Line

[16:42] <Altreus> the Point doesn't need to know the Line

[16:43] <tonyo> it really sounds like there isn't a use case for the Point itself knowing about Line

[16:44] <PimDaniel> tonyo There is one case a point belongs to one an only one line.

[16:45] <Altreus> But still

[16:45] <Altreus> What does the Point do with the Line?

[16:45] <Altreus> The best way to solve the problem is to not need the thing :D

[16:45] <PimDaniel> tonyo The Other cases are yet done. with chained points .

[16:47] <Altreus> but maybe you do my $point1 = Point.new(...); my $point2 = Point.new(...); my $point3 = Point.new(...); my $line1 = Line.new($point1, $point2); my $line2 = Line.new($point2, $point3); my $line3 = Line.new($point3, $point1);

[16:47] <tonyo> here is how you'd do it with require https://gist.github.com/tony-o/34d0aa032a68a597fffdc4149d2d47d2

[16:47] <Altreus> This is of course a triangle

[16:47] <Altreus> But if you change any point, both lines change as a result

[16:47] <Altreus> because they share the point

[16:47] <Altreus> So instead of having both points know what lines they belong to, you simply ensure that those lines use the same point object

[16:48] <PimDaniel> Altreus: there are no triangle in my system. Well not really! just rectangles.

[16:48] <tonyo> then `use A; call-ba; => 42`

[16:49] <Altreus> PimDaniel: yes but I didn't want to do *four* points!

[16:49] <tonyo> still, possible and good idea shouldn't be conflated

[16:50] <Altreus> PimDaniel: Anyway I think you can make it work without having Line @belong

[16:50] <Altreus> Just two Points on Line

[16:50] <Altreus> or more!

[16:51] <PimDaniel> Altreus Yess, I agree. At first i'm not forced to type the Array and could link it as is. But i'll not be able to use Line method though.

[16:52] <tonyo> yes you will

[16:52] <PimDaniel> tonyo : so this could be the solution.

[16:53] <PimDaniel> tonyo but in fact i agree that this use case is NOT clear.

[16:54] <tonyo> m: class A { has @.belongs; }; class B { has $.a; submethod BUILD { $!a = A.new; $!a.belongs.push: self; }; method hi { "hi".say; }; }; B.new.a.belongs.first.hi;

[16:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 816281b91: OUTPUT: «hi␤»

[16:54] <tonyo> the design needs more thought, it seems intentionally chicken and egg

[16:55] <PimDaniel> tonyo it is a more general problem that i try to achieve in fact.

[16:55] <PimDaniel> It is an algorithm problem.

[16:55] <PimDaniel> which i asked here yet.

[16:56] <PimDaniel> I've got puzzled rectangles and i want to fill them.

[16:57] <PimDaniel> But where do i start?

[16:59] <PimDaniel> When i look as a human i see rectangles imbricated, but by computing, i must loop on Points or Lines : i need and algorithm.

[17:00] <Altreus> I think you don't need the array at all, that's my point

[17:01] <Altreus> in fact I don't think you need Lines at all

[17:01] <Altreus> a rectangle is four points

[17:01] <Altreus> those contain the important stuff - the numbers

[17:01] <PimDaniel> Please may you look at what i did here : https://github.com/Pim-tech/Orthogon

[17:02] <PimDaniel> which was made with theses algorithms: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5919298/algorithm-for-finding-the-fewest-rectangles-to-cover-a-set-of-rectangles-without/6634668#6634668

[17:03] <PimDaniel> This is a welknowed problem.

[17:03] <PimDaniel> *welknown

[17:04] <Altreus> This is interesting but unfortunately it is more than I can digest at the moment

[17:04] <Altreus> In fact it would appear to be the end of my day :D

[17:05] *** aluaces left
[17:05] <PimDaniel> Altreus i did not ask you to finish it tonight. I'm not your boss.

[17:06] <Altreus> :D

[17:06] <Altreus> hope you find a good answer soon :)

[17:06] * Altreus away

[17:06] <PimDaniel> Altreus but it gives you a subject to dream of for your nights.

[17:08] <PimDaniel> Altreus and tonyo : You don't need to undestand nothing of the last link: it is just to explicit the context.

[17:10] <PimDaniel> But if you look at the Jean-Yves DANIEL question into this link : it is the ultime final step which i need to achieve: How to fill the drawned rectangles?
