[01:33] <pilne> raku isn't really a bit-fiddling language (yet), not sure how "good" of a feature it would be honestly for a language like raku?

[01:33] <pilne> a bitarray/matrix module might be a fun thing to take a stab at

[01:35] <pilne> nevermind... nativecall makes it silly easy....

[01:35] <pilne> bless this language

[05:16] <summerisle> I'm looking at modifying the raku-mode SMIE rules - is there a complete grammar for raku that's readily available? I could swear I saw one at some point

[05:16] <summerisle> (for emacs)

[05:16] <summerisle> not a grammar _for_ emacs, but just the language

[05:17] <summerisle> ah https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp

[09:20] <El_Che> patrickb: if you have the time can you have a look at these build fails: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/runs/1795106357?check_suite_focus=true and https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/runs/1794747938?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:308

[09:21] <El_Che> patrickb: in short: rakud builds fine everywhere except on alpine edge and fedora rawhide

[09:21] <El_Che> patrickb: I suspect some binutils bug

[09:22] <patrickb> those are strange errors indeed...

[09:23] <patrickb> did you try contacting upstream?

[09:23] <El_Che> patrickb: all the other dev OSes like debian testing. unstable, experimental and ubunt dev build fine

[09:23] <El_Che> patrickb: not yet, trying to figure out where it breaks

[09:23] <El_Che> I posted the links on #moarvm

[10:49] <jmerelo> El_Che: it's a missing file. Is that compiled only in Alpine?

[10:49] <El_Che> jmerelo: the file is there

[10:49] <El_Che> jmerelo: it's werid as hell. The same tar compiles fine on other alpine releases

[10:50] <El_Che> with the same pkgs

[10:50] <jmerelo> El_Che: it's literally missing, because it cannot find it. It's difficult to argue with an error message.

[10:51] <El_Che> I'll add an ls to the podman cmds so it's clear the file is there

[10:52] *** cydf joined
[10:52] <El_Che> I habe been bitten by binutils with similar errors

[10:52] <El_Che> v

[10:52] <El_Che> that a good thing of containers, easy to reproduce :)

[10:52] <jmerelo> El_Che: you can try and convince me, but it's difficult to convince that command. I'd rather try and find why it's not finding it, and why it happens only there.

[10:53] *** aborazmeh left
[10:53] <El_Che> jmerelo: you're saying the same as I do :)

[10:53] <El_Che> I believe the build scripts think the file is not there

[10:53] *** wamba joined
[10:54] <El_Che> I looked at the obvious and the binutils in rawhide and fedora 33 are the same version

[10:55] <jmerelo> El_Che: maybe you could create a workflow that tests https://github.com/MoarVM/libatomic_ops before packaging it? That library has not changed for almost 3 years...

[10:57] <El_Che> jmerelo: that's not very different from what I do? The builds of moarvm/nqp/rakudo on fedora 31, 32 and 33 are fine. Do you mean to debug libatomic in isolation?

[10:58] *** pecastro joined
[10:58] <jmerelo> El_Che: That's what I meant, yes. The thing is I'm not sure it's using _that_ version of the library. Looking at Configure.pl, it looks like it's checking for the library and using that one if it's not present.

[10:58] <jmerelo> El_Che: It's also doing a lot of copying... 

[10:58] <jmerelo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/78f4f1d9e9de42bca98d4dfd06980ad4ea2d5d28/Configure.pl#L592-L596

[10:59] <El_Che> I am pretty sure it's not the library itself, but something in the moarvm build process or OS tool chain

[10:59] <jmerelo> El_Che: that's what I'm saying.

[11:00] <jmerelo> El_Che: Fedora has a libatomic_ops all by itself https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libatomic_ops It shouldn't need to compile it, I think...

[11:00] <El_Che> I can build the lib in isolation to be sure

[11:00] <El_Che> but idd

[11:00] <El_Che> indeed

[11:02] <jmerelo> El_Che:it does need headers, anyway

[11:04] <El_Che> the fedora fails happens later but is similarily weird

[11:04] <jmerelo> El_Che: my money would be on debugging Configure.pl. 

[11:04] <jmerelo> El_Che: Also, there's this PR https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1254 that I created precisely for test-compiling Alpine

[11:05] <El_Che> I am working on something to compile and package on all supported distros/versions

[11:05] <El_Che> as a refactoring of rakudo-pkg

[11:05] <El_Che> with the addition that you can specify commits of all components, next to releases

[11:05] <jmerelo> El_Che: great

[11:06] <El_Che> fork the repo, change a version file if necessary and see the results

[12:01] <El_Che> it looks like github actions will kil travis

[12:02] <lizmat> agree, although it feels like mostly suicide to me

[12:02] <lizmat> Travis made it harder and harder to use for open source

[12:03] <El_Che> yeah, I missed that because I had a pro account

[12:03] <El_Che> but it became very slow

[12:03] <lizmat> yeah, unusably so

[12:04] * lizmat spent an hour or so yesterday to remove Travis from all raku-community-modules

[12:04] <El_Che> I think I will be able to buid packages for 25 distro/version under the 10 minutes where it tooks hours in travs

[19:11] <moritz> https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall

[19:14] <moritz> not as fancy as iypthon, but usable
