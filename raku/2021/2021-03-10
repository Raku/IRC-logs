[13:26] <cetjs2> jmerelo, why perl foundiation isn't approved in gsoc 2021?

[13:27] <jmerelo> cetjs2: I'd like to know why too

[13:27] <jmerelo> It simply was not.

[13:28] <jmerelo> We didn't get any more feedback than telling us there were many submissions.

[13:28] <cetjs2> jmerelo, (

[13:28] <jmerelo> Right. Big disappointment. Sorry about that.

[13:29] <jmerelo> We're gonna try again with season of docs, but of course and again, no guarantee...

[13:33] <jmerelo> Well, going through the accepted projects it's difficult to find out why some were accepted... while others were not.

[13:34] <jmerelo> Some note taking apps... Upcoming languages... Disjointed projects from an university. They probably put up a better application that I did, but still...

[17:25] <tbrowder> well, again i can't get https://docs.raku.org, it's intermittent (ssl protocol error, chrome), but it sure looks like a tls problem on the server end to me. i have no problems with any other sites.

[17:26] <lizmat> tbrowder; works for me :-(

[17:28] <tbrowder> i know, that's what everyone says, but i think most ppl who use docs are outside us (but it may be my isp).

[17:28] <lizmat> tbrowder: are you behind some proxy ?   sometimes overloaded proxy servers can produce those phenomena

[17:29] <tbrowder> no proxy

[17:29] <lizmat> which provider?

[17:30] <tbrowder> but isp is cox cable. i've talked to them and they swear there is nothing between me and the internet

[17:30] <lizmat> hmmm

[17:32] <tbrowder> i have tried various dns servers like google and opendns but still get intermittent probs with docs.raku.org

[17:32] <jmerelo> tbrowder: I'll tell Roman

[17:32] <tbrowder> thnx, jj

[17:34] <lizmat> tbrowder: do you have a time when this problem started?

[17:34] *** domidumont joined
[17:35] <lizmat> wonder if it could somehow be related to http://travaux.ovh.net/?do=details&id=49471&

[17:35] <lizmat> it appears this also affected the banking app of one of the leading banks in NL

[17:37] <jmerelo> lizmat: rba had set up a CDN. Maybe the CDN is hosted partly there... Anyhow, I've reported it to rba

[17:39] *** plvicente joined
[17:53] <raydiak> fwiw, I've had the exact same intermittent tls error as tbrowder on comcast using linux chromium for at least a month or two

[17:55] <rba> tbrowder: Try https://docs.rakulang.site

[17:55] <lizmat> feels to me TLS errors are an indicating of a Man in the middle having problems with handling certificates ?

[17:55] <lizmat> rba++

[17:55] <rba> This is directly to the server, not via CDN. 

[18:00] <raydiak> https://docs.raku.org/ currently doesn't work for me, but https://docs.rakulang.site/ does

[18:01] <lizmat> perhaps one of the servers in the CDN is having issues, hence the intermittentness of the issue?

[18:01] <raydiak> just a stab in the dark, but one of the common causes of this error is serving http on 443 where https should be served. possible misconfig of the cdn or even just one of its edge nodes? it's not an expired cert error, which is what I assumed at first when I saw this back in jan iirc

[18:01] <rba> For me docs.raku org works. Yet this doesn’t mean anything as the CDN has different entry points. 

[18:02] <raydiak> error is 3 lines: This site can’t provide a secure connection  docs.raku.org sent an invalid response.  ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR

[18:03] <rba> https://www.cloudflarestatus.com

[18:05] <jmerelo> A couple of places in America have been rerouted...

[18:05] <codesections> yeah, that sounds a lot like problem on the cloudflare end.  Maybe it's something to open a support ticket with them about?

[18:05] <jmerelo> Anyway, remember there's an almost up-to-date mirror at https://rakudocs.github.io There's at least 1 good thing of having fully static pages

[18:07] <codesections> jmerelo: yeah, but I'm concerned about how widespread this could be.  Getting an apparent server error on your first or second visit to the docs page is a pretty awful first impression for us to make

[18:07] <jmerelo> codesections++

[18:07] <tonyo_> looks ok for me, in the western US

[18:07] <codesections> There are _lots_ of good things about having a fully static site :D

[18:08] <raydiak> even weirder is to circumvent it I've been going to http instead, then it sends me to safebrowse.io or something and says this site is dangerous (redirect is on the cloudflare end, not a browser error, confirmed this with netcat). I click proceed anyway, and then it takes me to the site with https, and it works...for a while...

[18:08] <codesections> (works for me too, in central US)

[18:09] *** patrickb joined
[18:09] <lizmat> I wonder if CloudFlare has names for each of its entry points, so one could check if one is faulty ?

[18:10] <lizmat> for a particular site like docs.raku.org 

[18:10] <lizmat> ?

[18:11] <rba> I‘m not aware of such a detailed state info. 

[18:12] <lizmat> is there a way to escalate this ?

[18:12] <rba> If we have too much trouble I can try turn of the cdn. 

[18:12] <tonyo_> if you curl -v it shows a `report-to` header

[18:12] <tonyo_> shows cf-nel for me, currently in oregon

[18:13] <codesections> there's also the `cf-request-id` header, but not sure of the details

[18:14] <codesections> cf-nel for me too

[18:15] <codesections> with the url https://a.nel.cloudflare.com/report?s=$long-id

[18:17] <codesections> but I don't think that indicates an entry point.  See https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050691831-Understanding-Network-Error-Logging

[18:17] <tbrowder> one prob may be using css or js (or other resources) from non-https links, a definite no-no with modern browsers. i do sometimes see the docs without css.

[18:17] <codesections> nel = NEL = network error logging

[18:18] <raydiak> shouldn't have to do with links, this error happens before the page content is even loaded

[18:18] <raydiak> curl gives me curl: (35) error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number

[18:19] <tbrowder> well, i'm glad i'm no longer crying wolf :-D

[18:19] <rba> Changed docs.raku.org from proxified to dns only 

[18:19] <codesections> never thought you were :)

[18:20] <raydiak> which iirc, just means it got back something that isn't a valid TLS ServerHello, not necessarily a version mismatch specifically

[18:20] <codesections> oh, curl also gave the SSL cert:

[18:20] <codesections> subject: C=US; ST=CA; L=San Francisco; O=Cloudflare, Inc.; CN=sni.cloudflaressl.com

[18:22] *** plvicente left
[18:22] <tbrowder> just kidding, when i first reported it some time ago i don't remember anyone else seeing it

[18:23] <raydiak> thanks rba++ . I still get the error, but I'd assume it takes a while for the dns changes to propogate

[18:24] <codesections> rba: is turning off the CDN going to mean we have too much traffic/hosting costs more, or will it just not be as fast for users who aren't near our server?

[18:24] <codesections> (and where is our server, anyway?)

[18:25] <lizmat> not in Strasbourg, presumably  :-)

[18:25] <codesections> raydiak: curl now shows me connecting directly, so the dns has updated for me anyway

[18:27] <tbrowder> jmerelo: ref gsoc, remember sean morrison at brlcad.org? they got accepted for gsoc again this year (for the zillionth time). one thing sean did some years ago was partner with other cad orgs and entered as the leader of a group of orgs.

[18:28] <jmerelo> tbrowder: my buddies at chaoss.org got accepted again this time over... They always are.

[18:28] <tbrowder> it provided a wider menu of interests for students as well as maybe have more mentors

[18:29] <jmerelo> tbrowder: but I really don't know. It's true that last year the proposal was not so good, but I really tried to make a good case this year. Wider menus might be it, but then it might not

[18:29] <jmerelo> tbrowder: I'll try with season of docs, anyway

[18:29] <jmerelo> BTW, I will share the proposal with you 

[18:30] <tbrowder> hm, healthcare, lots of points there. raku vs go, maybe not so many points. of course we know google is completely unbiased

[18:32] <jmerelo> tbrowder: but then, "Pharo" was funded.

[18:32] <tbrowder> what is pharo

[18:32] <jmerelo> tbrowder: exactly

[18:32] <tbrowder> heh

[18:33] <jmerelo> Due to lack of feedback, it's really complicated to "improve" proposals from one year to the next. We don't know if it's the track record, the language itself and whatever people are lately saying about it, or the proposal.

[18:33] <raydiak> codesections: working from my server in central california, but not yet for me locally up in washington state. wouldn't be surprised if there's some DNS caching on my ISP's end

[18:34] <jmerelo> Anyway, we'll keep trying. When funded, it's a good thing for the language and community. It takes some time, but well, ROI is good if achieved.

[19:49] <raydiak> I do think it's still broken. my local machine and my server are both resolving to the direct IP address. but on my local machine, the error persists. firefox gives the slightly more informative error "SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG". according to wireshark, after it sends the ClientHello, it receives a tcp payload of 256 FF bytes instead of a TLS ServerHello. https://docs.rakulang.site/ works great everywhere.

[19:50] <MasterDuke> codesections: using `method get_timestamp() { use nqp; (nqp::time_n() * 1000e0).Int; }` (note lack of return and num literal), `my @ids = $worker.get_id() xx 10000000;` is ~7s faster than mapping over the Range

[19:52] <codesections> MasterDuke: Interesting, ty.  I get why the `xx` is faster, but why is `(num * Num).Int` faster than `(num * Int).Int`?

[19:53] <codesections> or are our literals smart enough that 1000e0 is a num rather than a Num?

[19:54] <MasterDuke> well, i'll admit i haven't benchmarked that change very much

[19:56] <lizmat> codesections numeric literals are almost all both in teh AST

[19:57] <lizmat> if I remember correctly  :-)

[19:57] <MasterDuke> benchable6: HEAD compare use nqp; my num $n = nqp::time_n(); my $i; $i := ($n * 1000).Int for ^1_000_000; ||| use nqp; my num $n = nqp::time_n(); my $i; $i := ($n * 1000e0).Int for ^1_000_000;;

[19:57] <benchable6> MasterDuke, No new data found

[19:57] <codesections> also, it seems like (int * num) should return a num, but right now it returns a Num.  Do you think it'd be worth adding an infix:<*>(int \a, num \b --> num) multi?  (and a matching (num \a, int \b) one)?

[19:58] <codesections> right now, num * int falls back to Num * Num

[19:58] <benchable6> MasterDuke, https://gist.github.com/27ebba85f0a5cf575230d5fdc027241f

[19:59] <MasterDuke> yeah, num literal is a bunch faster

[20:00] <codesections> MasterDuke++ that makes sense.  I didn't know our literals were that smart.

[20:03] <tonyo_> is benchable6 using Bench ?

[20:04] <MasterDuke> yeah

[20:45] <rba> codesections: afaik there are mainly the images cached on the cdn side. So far the traffic to the server itself haven't been an issue.

[20:55] <codesections> rba: mainly the images on the docs site?  So, pretty much just Camilla, then? :D

[20:56] <codesections> or, wait, does that include the "Type Graph" SVGs?  Because those don't load correctly for me about 30% of the time; if they were on the CDN, I suppose that could be related…

[22:33] <rba> codesections: So, as the CDN is turned of atm, you might give me some feedback in the next days?

[22:38] <codesections> I'd be happy to.  But (and this is part of what makes me wonder if the issues could be related) as with the issue tbrowder mentioned, I'll have long-ish periods where the type graphs display fine, followed by a few days when they consistently don't.  So if I don't see any issue in the next days, that won't really prove that it was the CDN.  But I'll keep you posted

[22:39] <codesections> (I also can't remember the last time the type graphs didn't display; I don't pay a whole lot of attention to them most of the time)

[22:41] <tbrowder> i'm trying to extend DateTime with a new "new" method by inheriting from and adding the new "new" but not having much luck so far.

[22:43] <tbrowder> after getting to see the docs again, i don't see a clear example of that situation, so i filed a doc issue.

[22:45] <tbrowder> i'll try to start with a simpler case for now and see if i get that working. if i can't, i'll post some code for help. if i do get it working, i will take ownership of the issue.
