[09:40] <Manifest0> I'm trying to get single keypresses from stdin. The docs have this "Using getc to get a single keypress from a terminal will only work properly if you've set the terminal to "unbuffered". "
[09:40] <Manifest0> but what does this mean? In bash i just do "read -n1". How can i achieve the same in Raku?
[09:43] <mfiano> I would assume `read` does the unbuffering itself.
[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know but the meaning is rather clear: stdin is typically more greedy than waiting for sole characters, it has a buffer and that buffer is filled whenever you are asked for input
[09:45] <mfiano> There are various ways to control the chunk size in Linux
[09:45] <mfiano> one way is the unbuffer command from expect
[09:45] <Mondenkind> Manifest0: it is a pain.  You must mess with ioctls
[09:46] <mfiano> Another is stdbuf from coreutils
[09:46] <Mondenkind> I suggest looking at Term::termios
[09:46] <Mondenkind> Manifest0: https://github.com/krunen/term-termios
[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is "read" bash-exclusive or a program?
[09:47] <mfiano> its part of bash
[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well meh, then I'm not sure if it would work with qx
[09:47] * Manifest0 checking Term::termios
[09:48] <Manifest0> is github down? :-(
[09:49] <mfiano> It's just you

[15:00] <mfiano> Does the file extension of a module matter? Reading an older book before the rename that recommends .pm or .pm6

[15:09] <[Coke]> Altai-man: I assume the end result is we get nice examples somewhere, so let's update them in place for now, and if they end up in docs, fine.
[15:09] <Altai-man> [Coke], sure, note it's only half baked (the web bit migration needs more tinkering).
[15:09] <[Coke]> ah
[15:10] <[Coke]> it may be difficult to incorporate then. I'll see what I can do. I think I want to get the site generating again (at least once by hand), then we can pull in those bits. Thanks, looks like you did a lot of stuff already.

[15:12] <[Coke]> Thanks!
[15:12] <[Coke]> Sorry if I'm stepping on toes. I just wanted to fix the Euler issue and then yak shaving started.
[15:13] <Altai-man> no-no, I know how it goes
[15:13] <Altai-man> it's a long story though
[15:13] <Altai-man> the thing is, my main concern about this repo is the website looking silly
[15:14] <[Coke]> Agreed, could use a facelift just on styles (but also a bunch of other stuff)
[15:14] <Altai-man> it's not about contents being outdated or something, it just looks very 2009 and IMO does the opposite to attracting new users. creates a negative image? maybe this fits
[15:14] <[Coke]> I think it's the same as an older version of docs.
[15:14] <Altai-man> so I wanted to completely remake it, did some work
[15:15] <[Coke]> Is that in this branch?
[15:15] <Altai-man> [Coke], we don't have a "new" version of docs, it's exactly the same design. :P
[15:15] <Altai-man> [Coke], no, no UI changes in my branch, only content.
[15:15] <Altai-man> But then people said "Oh, why bother with this, just improve the docs".
[15:16] <Altai-man> So I went and re-imagined the docs website, fixing the silly UI, broken search, added modern features etc
[15:17] <Altai-man> then it was ditched with insults and bikeshedding
[15:17] <Altai-man> thus we have docs from 2009 and examples from 2009
[15:17] <Altai-man> but what I think is that if we have it this way
[15:18] <Altai-man> then fixing docs tickets (like missing documentation bits! please, write docs, folks) is more efficient towards users

[16:28] <mfiano> There is only 1 thing I don't agree with about the language so far, but that may change.
[16:30] <mfiano> Normally languages that have multiple dispatch do not associate methods with classes...they are separate toplevel constructs. I can't see would want to couple behavior to state like this, as it is much less flexible.
[16:30] <Altai-man> mfiano, there is no need to associate methods with classes.
[16:31] <mfiano> There is no need to even allow it is my point.
[16:31] <Altai-man> ah

[16:34] <mfiano> I'll keep this oddity in my mind while I continue reading more about the language. It was just 1 thing that stuck out at me, being familiar with several languages with multiple dispatch

[21:30] <timo> instead of storing it on the server, you just edit the URL with the data in it with the buttons
[21:30] <timo> though it's easier in the summary mode since there you turn on checkboxes for every line and need one click per line instead of two
