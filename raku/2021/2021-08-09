[14:06] <melezhik> Can I insert perl5 regexp into Raku regexps?
[14:07] <Altreus> instinctively I would say no, but I am not an expert here
[14:07] <Altreus> you can probably use Inline::Perl5 to run a Perl5 regex independently, though
[14:07] <melezhik> I rings a bell with me, I saw something in Raku regexp docs
[14:09] <melezhik> `m:Perl5`
[14:09] <melezhik> looks like way to go
[14:10] <Altreus> oo that's nice
[14:10] <Altreus> shows what I know
[14:14] <sena_kun> keep in mind that is a "semi-broken feature lying around" as per https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2624
[14:14] <sena_kun> so please avoid it at all costs. :)
[14:15] <melezhik> thanks sena_kun
[14:15] <Altreus> :)
[14:16] <Altreus> so actually using Inline::Perl5 to run Perl5 code with a Perl5 regex in might be best?
[14:24] *** Sgeo joined
[14:29] <sena_kun> Altreus, I guess. The ticket conversation describes there are some issues, but I don't see any harm in them.
[14:29] <sena_kun> And if there are others, it's better to report and get those fixed than use something like :P5 modifier, really.

[15:03] <melezhik> so sadly I can't use `:Perl5` modifier inside regexp ...
[15:03] <melezhik> locally 
[15:04] <melezhik> because this probably only works for adverbs
[15:04] <melezhik> if there is any method btw to convert perl5 regexp into Raku ones?
[15:05] <sena_kun> melezhik, not really, I think for a long time it is lazily speculated one can write a compiler similar to https://github.com/edumentab/p6-ecma262regex
[15:06] <melezhik> ok, NP

[16:12] <lizmat> Oscar: what would it do *exactly* ?
[16:14] <Oscar> It is in a desired modules list I found, it would simply allow the blowfish cipher algorithm to be used to encrypt/decrypt data https://github.com/Raku/raku-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/modules.md
[16:19] <lizmat> sounds like a plan then  :-)
