[00:01] <sampersand> makes sense

[00:01] <sampersand> let me try to explain it so you dont have to read it through

[00:03] <sampersand> So to learn new programming languages, i implement this dumb little language I've dubbed `Knight` . I've designed the language spec in such a way that it's easy to implement the language in anything i want.

[00:03] *** xelxebar joined
[00:03] <summerisle> sampersand: are there samples anywhere?

[00:03] <sampersand> So, in Raku, I thought it might be cool to do it with grammar

[00:03] <sampersand> yeah, i have it implemented in about a half dozen languages by now

[00:04] *** clarjon1 joined
[00:04] <summerisle> i want to make a lisp-like language that spits out qast to mix with raku

[00:04] *** DiffieHellman joined
[00:04] <sampersand> <https://github.com/sampersand/knight/tree/raku> the C, haskell, perl, php, python, ruby, rust, AWK, and posix-compliant SH examples all work

[00:04] <sampersand> with the asm, raku, and quest versions each almost done.

[00:05] *** asymptotically joined
[00:06] *** tejr joined
[00:07] <sampersand> i want to finish the raku version this weekend, complete with comments. (I have only commented the C, php, and perl impls so far...)

[00:08] <sampersand> though of the languages ive explored so far, raku's my favourite and the one ill probably continue after my quest is over

[00:36] <Doc_Holliwood> Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple, Microsoft and Dozens of Other Companies

[00:39] <summerisle> i know Zef has to run a build step for native stuff. i suppose that step could be as isolated as possible using something like bwrap on linux, whatever on bsd, etc...

[00:40] <summerisle> seeing as the build would need access to system dependencies for headers, libraries, and tooling

[01:33] <guifa2> .tell Doc_Holliwood we had actually been talking about that for a while.  The main thing is ensuring that people use :auth<foo>.  IIRC, zef already will only use a github source owned by github user foobar given :auth<git:foobar>

[01:33] <tellable6> guifa2, I'll pass your message to Doc_Holliwood

[01:35] <guifa2> local libraries via (use 'lib') are also always preferred over.  But ugexe is definitely the expert on the topic

[02:14] <sampersand> ok so ive been hacking at this on my own for a while

[02:15] <sampersand> but i still cant completely crack it

[02:18] <sampersand> so, i have a role `Value`, which everything in Knight implements—numbers, functions, identifiers, strings, everything. Every type has an "assign" method, but it simply convert that type to a string, then an identifier: `= (+ "__ast_" ast_level) 3` . As such, my `Value` type has a function called `assign`: `method assign(Value $value, --> Value) {

[02:18] <sampersand> Identifier.new($.Str).assign: $value }` . However, since `Identifier` `use`s `Value`, im getting a circular import

[02:18] <sampersand> any ideas?

[06:43] <summerisle> pretty sure raku doesn't currently have import aliasing (without modifying EXPORT in the desired package), or am I missing something?

[06:46] <guifa2> summerisle: correct.  The author of the package would need to set up a way for things to be aliased

[06:52] <elcaro> summerisle: for a name that gets imported automatically, you can crete your own alias, but of course, the original name is still in your namespace

[06:52] <elcaro> eg. my &slfn := &super-long-function-name; slfn('foo')

[06:53] <guifa2> ^^ yeah that's true, I figuerd he wanted to avoid the original and only have the custom one

[06:54] <elcaro> unfortunately, Raku makes it easier to for module writers to pollute the users namespace than do selective imports

[06:56] <elcaro> my `Exportable` module attempts to make that easier

[06:56] <elcaro> ideally, `is export` should have made subs _available_ for import, and only exported by default when you do `is export(:DEFAULT)`

[06:58] <elcaro> interestingly, I believe this is how Damian's `Perl6::Export` module for perl5 does it

[06:58] * guifa2 wishes that the `use` passed *both* positionals *and* named to the EXPORT sub.  I think I could od some more interesting things there

[06:59] <elcaro> I mentioned this last time this topic came up, but this is all things i complain-blogged about a couple years ago here: https://0racle.info/articles/exportation_exploration

[07:00] <elcaro> in that article, I also show a hackjob way of doing import aliasing (with the syntax `use Foo \[ foo => 'bar' ]; # imports &foo as &bar`)

[07:00] <elcaro> but the EXPORT sub needs to support it, of course

[07:05] <elcaro> as mentioned in the second part of that article, the "sane" way of supporting aliasing, is to have you subs `our` scoped, and import nothing by default

[07:05] <summerisle> my question comes more from a place of concern about symbol fighting, e.g. if Foo::Bar has `sub frobnicate() is export` and so does Foo::Baz, and I need to include them both - it seems like there will either be some runtime error, or `use` order will become significant.

[07:05] <elcaro> `module Foo { our sub bar { ... } }` can be imported as `use Foo; my &foobar := &Foo::bar; foobar(...)`

[07:06] <summerisle> other than that, namespace pollution isn't a terrible concern if it's not obtrusive.

[07:06] <elcaro> yeah, it's a problem, but there are work-arounds

[07:06] <elcaro> since `use` is lexical, you can import inside a block, aliase to a name outside the block

[07:07] <elcaro> something like `my &foobaz-frob = do { use Foo::Baz; &frobnicate }`

[07:07] <elcaro> I think... the syntax is something like that

[07:07] <summerisle> well, of course that works

[07:08] <summerisle> but it's still working around a language semantics issue

[07:08] <summerisle> albeit a somewhat theoretical one

[07:09] <elcaro> well, yeah, at least there's a relatively simple work around. As mentioned, I really wish implicit exports weren't the path of least resistance... but I think the ship has sailed on any changes to that now

[07:10] <elcaro> unless something like `is exportable` (similar to my module) is added to core, and strongly recommended by the community

[07:10] <summerisle> i could see it happening

[07:11] <summerisle> i'd be more interested in matcher/grammar optimizations though - i should look at the guts for that

[07:11] <elcaro> yes, when I said "ship has sailed" i mean, we can't change the semantics of `is export` now... it's too late, but we can offer a better alternative. it's do-able

[07:14] <summerisle> has anyone done a writeup on nativecall overhead? i'd be interested in reading that

[21:23] <guifa2> perry: the measurement kind.

[21:24] <perry> And unit formatting as in unit typesetting?

[21:24] <perry> I know a thing or two about that, if so.

[21:24] <guifa2> format-unit(3, 'meter') --> "3 meters"

[21:25] <guifa2> problem gets when you have something crazy like

[21:25] <perry> Ah.

[21:26] <guifa2> format-unit(4.5, 'kilogram-meters-per-millisecond') or something crazy

[21:26] <guifa2> Unicode's devised a system that lets you go pretty crazy, even if the units make no sense

[21:26] <perry> :D

[21:28] <guifa2> simple units are easy

[21:28] <guifa2> https://github.com/alabamenhu/IntlFormatUnit/blob/main/lib/Intl/Format/Unit.pm6

[21:29] <guifa2> but it'll be a nice blog post because it really can take advantage of grammars

[21:30] <guifa2> Unicode provides a grammar that took all of about one minute to convert to Raku's format.  Add in some action classes to create some nodes that link back to the original data and boom.  Raku makes something complicated easy.  

[21:30] <guifa2> Trick is I haven't added the grammatical meta data into CLDR yet haha
