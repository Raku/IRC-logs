[09:34] <tib> Hello, by any huge luck, does somebody would like and have material to pick a talk slot in the epehemeral miniconf (the talk need to be focused on Raku)? Just trying üòõ 

[09:41] *** sm2 left
[10:03] *** releasable6 joined
[10:17] <El_Che> tib: put "weekly: " before your question

[10:17] <El_Che> and it will be sent today or tomorrow in the raku weekly

[10:29] <lizmat> well, perhaps  

[10:29] <lizmat> :-)

[10:30] <El_Che> yeah, lizmat is known for being a canceller

[10:30] <El_Che> :)

[10:31] <lizmat> fwiw, you'd have to be colourblind to not see that it is about Perl

[10:32] <lizmat> sorry tib, but I don't feel it's appropriate to put in the Rakudo Weekly News

[10:33] <lizmat> s:g/Perl/Perl and Raku/  is not enough to make an event inclusive  

[10:33] <sourceable6> lizmat, No idea, boss. Can you give me a Code object? Output: https://gist.github.com/a54d3200e3a5675e743b97d58b30a8bb

[10:34] <lizmat> sorry sourceable6 :-)

[11:01] <El_Che> sowwy lizmat and tib

[11:02] <El_Che> sorry

[11:02] <lizmat> El_Che: no worries  :-)

[11:02] <lizmat> and no apology needed

[11:02] <lizmat> at least to me :-)

[11:05] *** sm2 joined
[11:11] <tib> yep no problem El_Che :) I forgive you if you give a raku talk

[11:13] <El_Che> I could paradize a "Raku, Not Perl" in the line of GNU not Unix :)

[13:11] <lizmat> just start with "weekly:"  :-)

[14:28] <tbrowder> El_Che: a

[14:29] <El_Che> b?

[14:30] <tbrowder> *a mac update: after over 20 hrs of an apparently locked install/reboot, i did a hard restart (power off/on) my mini came up like a charm

[14:30] <tbrowder> AND i can get to my website ok!

[14:31] <El_Che> yeah, macos updates are painful compared to linux

[14:31] <El_Che> (windows: hold my beer)

[14:32] <tbrowder> so, maybe my buds have murfled systems somehow, at least i know a mac will see it. now i have to see if i can install my own cert.

[14:33] <tbrowder> but only after i try installing raku

[18:22] <algorev> Hello!

[18:22] <algorev> I need some help understanding the hyperoperator

[18:23] <algorev> As far as i understand it's kinda like zipping two lists together by applying an operation to pairs of elements

[18:23] <tonyo> at least you have somewhat of a reasonable expectation that when osx upgrades most of your stuff will still work

[18:23] *** Altai-man left
[18:23] <algorev> What i don't understand is: what is the meaning of the orientation of the guillemets?

[18:23] <tonyo> linux update means i have no idea if my video driver is going to work

[18:24] <algorev> How is <<+>> different from <<+<< or even >>+<<

[18:26] <algorev> Putting the guillemets whichever way does not seem to change anythingt

[18:26] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%3C%3C has some info

[18:26] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) >>*>> 2

[18:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95164a768: OUTPUT: ¬´(2 4 6)‚ê§¬ª

[18:27] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) <<*<< 2

[18:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95164a768: OUTPUT: ¬´Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of infix:<*> are not of the same length while recursing‚ê§left: 3 elements, right: 1 elements‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[18:28] <tbrowder> i don't know my mac os version, but i'll check...

[18:29] <[Coke]> tbrowder: sw_vers

[18:29] <tonyo> m: say (1,2,3) <<*>> 2

[18:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95164a768: OUTPUT: ¬´(2 4 6)‚ê§¬ª

[18:29] <algorev> What does it mean, then, if you do <<+>> or >>+<<, for example?

[18:31] <[Coke]> if the lists are the same size, I don't think it matters with that operator. If they're different, you get a warning, or it loops.

[18:31] <algorev> I see.

[18:31] <[Coke]> m: say (1,2,3) <<+<< (4,5,6,7,8,9)

[18:32] <algorev> Ohhhh makes sense

[18:32] <algorev> Ok thankssss

[18:32] <[Coke]> (ah, truncated is another option)

[18:33] <[Coke]> ... I agree this could use some better intro text on the docs site

[18:34] <algorev> I agree  that the  docs, while complete, are kinda intimidating

[18:34] <algorev> I mean there's all you could ever need

[18:35] <algorev> But my brain kinda freezes when i see sentences llike "Assignment metaoperators can be hyped." while being utterly new to everything raku

[18:36] *** algorev left
[18:38] <tonyo> the docs do kind of bleed a bunch of concepts into one another

[18:39] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: Removing the link does not seem to me to be important, but it probably should be an issue that `Str` is not documented in a single place. Strings and stringification are important enough to need a separate document.
