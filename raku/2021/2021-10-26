[02:35] <eof> is there a limit on heredoc sentinel length? I'm inclined to say there isn't.
[02:36] <eof> unfortunately for the purposes of an expirement I am doing with treesitter, I need to at least impose an artificial one for the parser...

[09:21] <patrickb> Is there an obvious way to make such variable accesses error?

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> Morning. I seem to be having trouble with inputs this morning.
[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> I'm doing something akin to `loop { my $name = prompt; redo unless $name ~~ $regex }`
[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> actually, no, it's not a `$regex`, it's a subset with a where clause that uses a regex
[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> So, closer to this: `subset Command of Str where * ~~ /:i ^ EXIT $ /; loop { my $command = prompt; redo unless $command ~~ Command; }`
[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> Said code only loops and doesn't ever break. What am I missing.
[14:51] *** linkable6 joined
[14:53] <dakkar> RaycatWhoDat#0001: wild guess, a newline?
[14:53] <dakkar> oh, no, `prompt` removes the newline already
[14:54] <dakkar> oh, no, `prompt` removes the newline already
[15:01] <dakkar> RaycatWhoDat#0001: suggestion: replace that `prompt` with `prompt(">")` or something similar
[15:02] <dakkar> there's a *separate* bug in that loop, in that it doesn't detect EOF
[15:02] <dakkar> then, the real bug: `redo unless ‚Ä¶` should probably be `last if ...`
[15:03] <dakkar> the loop will loop until you exit it, but you are never exiting, you're just looping in a different way
[15:03] *** reportable6 joined
[15:04] <dakkar> RaycatWhoDat: subset Command of Str where * ~~ /:i ^ EXIT $ /; loop { my $command = prompt(">>") // last; last if $command ~~ Command; say "I will do <$command>" }
[15:04] <tellable6> dakkar, I'll pass your message to RaycatWhoDat
[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <RaycatWhoDat#0001> I see it
[15:04] <dakkar> `re
[15:05] <dakkar> `redo` is pretty uncommon, in my experience
[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `redo` is basically continue, isn't it
[15:12] * Juerd loves redo for retries

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hi! I plan to make a Raku package / repository that generates random data, like, vectors of random words or pet names, or random tabular datasets. Right now I am using the working name `Data::RandomDataGenerators`  and there are sub-modules like `Data::RandomDataGenerators::RandomWord`  and  `Data::RandomDataGenerators::RandomPretentiousJobTitle`. I think that maybe it would be better to use the more gen

[19:03] <melezhik> SmokeMachine you can announce the need of help with Red using "help wanted" comment on mybfio, as an example - https://mybf.io/project/mybfio/reviews
[19:04] <melezhik> the "raise hand" icon will stick to a project in the listing for a month

[20:03] <tbrowder> melezhic: have you thought about renaming your code site to something easier to remember?
[20:04] <tbrowder> i want to link to it on the Raku.org website if no one objects

[20:52] <melezhik> tbrowder - do you mean having easier to pronounce dsn name?
[20:52] <melezhik> dns
[21:01] <CIAvash> gfldex: no, how would it look like? and what are the benefits? error when no candidate is matched?
[21:02] <melezhik> I might change dns in the future, right now I am not sure I am ready to book a "permanent" dns, name, will it be difficult to change it later on raku site and meanwhile use the current one?

[21:09] <CIAvash> Will look into it, I need to go to bed now üôÇ
