[00:04] <tbrowder>  hi, rakoons: \o/

[00:04] <tbrowder> need some advice, having probs with testing using zef or mi6

[00:05] <tbrowder> when i rub

[00:05] *** reportable6 joined
[00:06] <tbrowder> *run module tests with "raku -I lib t/*t" they run fine

[00:08] <tbrowder> but when i run either "mi6 test" or "zef test ." i get all tests ok but a failure because "parse error, subtest 1 has no plan"

[00:08] <tbrowder> afaik i have NO subtests

[00:09] <tbrowder> any ideas? i'll send a link in a mo

[00:11] <tbrowder> see https://github.com/tbrowder/DateTime-US.git

[00:12] <tbrowder> zef and mi6 are the latest versions

[00:12] <tbrowder> i'm probably doing something stupid and can't see it, but...

[00:19] *** gordonfish- joined

[01:07] <ugexe> maybe its TAP module

[01:07] <ugexe> sounded like you had an old version installed a few days ago

[01:08] <ugexe> to see if thats true try `zef test . --/tap-harness`

[01:17] <tbrowder> thnx, nick...

[01:19] <tbrowder> wow, that did it! what just happened?

[01:19] <tbrowder> i thought i upgraded TAP...

[01:22] <tbrowder> i did, it's the latest p: 0.2.1

[01:33] <tbrowder> hm, and how does that affect the mi6 test failure?

[01:46] <tbrowder> if --/tap-harness disables the tap-harness plugin, how can it be removed?

[01:46] *** perlbot joined
[01:48] <tbrowder> otherwise it looks  like my module testing is broken (and the same thing happens in git testing)

[01:51] <ugexe> mi6 uses TAP to test i presume

[01:52] <ugexe> you would remove it via `zef uninstall TAP`

[01:52] <ugexe> but then mi6 probably wouldnt work

[01:55] <ugexe> might be worth submitting a bug report to TAP

[01:55] <ugexe> i get the same behavior 

[01:56] <skaji> if you remove this line  https://github.com/tbrowder/DateTime-US/blob/master/t/01-general.t#L8, then the test will pass.

[02:00] <tbrowder> skaji: thnx

[02:08] <tbrowder> ok, that fixed it, but what is the underlying problem?

[07:37] <patrickb> I need to have the raku ci bot app installed in those projects.

[07:42] <patrickb> Hm... Actually I'd favor being given access to those accounts, as I otherwise have to make the app public, which I'd rather not like to...

[10:53] <tbrowder> but i would like help with testing code writing to stdout as was causing problems yesterday until skaji and ugexe helped find the problem

[12:52] <ugexe> tbrowder: try changing `DateTime::US.show;` to `diag DateTime::US.show;`

[12:53] <ugexe> that should prefix the output in such a way that it wont be interpretted as TAP

[12:53] <tbrowder> ok…

[12:59] <tbrowder> that didn't work, bummer

[13:00] <tbrowder> i'm just ignoring  that test for a while, but thanks, very much anyway

[13:04] <ugexe> oh right, .show is doing the `say`s

[13:05] <ugexe> i guess you could use https://github.com/JJ/raku-io-capture-simple to capture the output so TAP never sees it

[13:06] <ugexe> it has a Test::IO::Capture modules it looks like

[13:06] <Altreus> IMO test frameworks should set that stuff up for you

[13:06] <ugexe> although you probably would just want to use IO::Capture::Simple since using Test::IO::Capture would require you to test for the entire string it outputs

[13:07] <Altreus> or at least offer it

[13:07] <ugexe> im sure there are some test frameworks that do

[13:08] <Altreus> I guess I'm thinking they should black-hole it (or at least diag() it) by default, but if you wanted to test stdout then you can just capture it yourself

[13:19] <tbrowder> thnx for suggestions…will report what wrx

[13:19] <Altreus> raku's stolen tbrowder's vowels!

[15:00] <tbrowder> ref test problem: would using "note" instead of "say" be better?

[15:05] *** reportable6 joined
[15:15] <tbrowder> okey dokey, success! i used IO::Capture::Simple inside of a "lives-ok

[15:16] <japhb> lizmat: logs.liz.nl returning blank pages?  Or is it just for me?

[15:16] <tbrowder> block and no failure. now i will improve the test a bit with inspecting the capture output

[15:17] <lizmat> japhb: home page works for me?

[15:17] *** patrickb left
[15:17] <lizmat> ah, but after that bang

[15:17] <[Coke]> https://logs.liz.nl/raku/2020-05-01.html gives a 500

[15:17] <tbrowder> thanks so much skaji, ugexe, and Altreus

[15:19] <lizmat> japhb: thanks for the nudge... fixed for now

[15:23] <[Coke]> lizmat: https://logs.liz.nl/moarvm/2021-10-22.html - geth messages have an unprintable char in them. Not sure if that's on me or the page.

[15:23] <[Coke]> (e.g. on the last one, it's right after the word "callstack"

[15:24] <Altreus> IO::Capture::Simple sounds like my sort of module

[15:24] <Altreus> tbrowder: I think I only threw in tangential suggestions but yay!

[15:25] *** nebuchadnezzar left
[15:25] <lizmat> [Coke] yeah, it looks like Geth is putting control characters in the messages :-(

[15:25] <lizmat> trying to figure out the best way how to deal with that

[15:25] <ugexe> m: { my $out; temp $*OUT = class :: { method print($str) { $out ~= $str } }; say 42; }; say 43;

[15:25] <lizmat> Altreus: have you looked at silently ?

[15:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6d45da84c: OUTPUT: «43␤»

[15:26] <Altreus> lizmat: nyet

[15:26] <Altreus> is it a role :D

[15:26] <lizmat> no, it is a sub  :-)

[15:27] <Altreus> aw, can't do thing() but silently;

[15:27] <Altreus> eh I guess you couldn't anyway

[15:27] <Altreus> :(

[15:27] <tbrowder> Altreus: i agree, i’m putting that module in my goto list for testing as well as maybe other needs in future

[15:27] <[Coke]> lizmat: when filtering, the first timestamp can be omitted (presumaly timestamps are done first, then filtering is done.)

[15:28] <[Coke]> so on this channel, filtered for me, only the second message shows the time.

[15:29] <lizmat> yeah, that's a side effect of thefiltering

[15:29] <lizmat> please make an issue for it :-)

[15:42] <[Coke]> lizmat: minor usability item: once a filter is set, it appears to be universal. I was surprised just now doing a search that had result dates, but clicking through was empty (I quickly figured out it was because I had filtered on my nick earlier) - maybe if there was an icon to indicate filtering was active.

[15:42] <lizmat> issue please  :-)

[15:43] <[Coke]> also: search for "motie" doesn't find anything despite there being a match in #moarvm yesterday

[15:45] <[Coke]> #23

[15:46] <melezhik> funny, when I click on `#23` I gets connected to channel 23 ))

[15:47] <melezhik> in my browser irc client

[15:47] <lizmat> [Coke] that's probably because you selected "as words"

[15:47] <lizmat> it does find "motie" when searching with "containing"

[15:49] <[Coke]> thought I switched that.

[15:50] <[Coke]> j

[15:51] <[Coke]> oh. it's searching per channel, didn't even realize.

[15:51] <[Coke]> user error, I guess. Thanks.

[17:50] <tbrowder> someone please remind me: given a module with class methods as well as some exported subs with the same name as methods, should the methods use the subs for definition or vice versa? thnx

[17:54] <lizmat> the subs should use the methods

[17:54] <lizmat> that way someone can add another candidate sub to special stuff, dispatch will then do the right thing
