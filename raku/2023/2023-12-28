[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube your welcome! 😄

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As I threatened / promised I made the multi-FEN-strings visualization:

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Painting the chessboard in white-orange is just to have a dramatic effect.)

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube that’s impressive really cool 😁

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thank you!

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume the next things to do is: (1) highlight moves by squares, (2) show moves with arrows, (3) chess playing engine.

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If there are any avid chess players in the Raku community -- I am interested to hear what Raku-and-chess use cases you might have.

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, (4) make the white figures really white, not just transparent.

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And, my favorite, (5) random chessboard after k random moves.
