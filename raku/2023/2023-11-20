[12:50] <El_Che> not all heroes wear capes, I would say

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean, think of Go üòÜ

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but then most C-family languages don't even have a logo

[15:43] <jjatria> patrickb: I was playing around with WebService::GitHub and I can see tags for 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 in the repo, but zef cannot find them (at least not on my box...)

[15:43] <jjatria> Is this something you are aware of?

[15:47] <lizmat> PSA: the weekly will be published tomorrow

[20:02] <yjh> Should new / changed files be loaded twice when used in multiple locations?

[20:02] <yjh> e.g.

[20:02] <yjh> file A.rakumod with:

[20:02] <yjh> say 'A';

[20:02] <evalable6> yjh, rakudo-moar 7a8ffa9d4: OUTPUT: ¬´A‚ê§¬ª

[20:02] <yjh> file B.rakumod with:

[20:02] <yjh> use A;

[20:02] <yjh> say 'B';

[20:02] <evalable6> yjh, rakudo-moar 7a8ffa9d4: OUTPUT: ¬´B‚ê§¬ª

[20:02] <yjh> file c.raku with:

[20:02] <yjh> use A;

[20:02] <yjh> use B;

[20:02] <yjh> and the output when first run:

[20:02] <yjh> A

[20:02] <yjh> A

[20:02] <yjh> B

[20:02] <yjh> and on following runs:

[20:02] <yjh> A

[20:02] <yjh> B

[21:17] <patrickb> jjatria: Thanks for the poke! I was aware and then forgot. I'm basically sitting out a `fez upload` bug. I can actually give it another try right now.

[21:24] <El_Che> so, how are we with the new release? I should add the new fedora release to rakudo-pkg

[21:42] <jjatria> ü§û 

[21:55] <patrickb> Nope. The indexer still doesn't like it.

[21:56] <patrickb> jjatria, if you are interested enough you could clone the repo and run `dev-scripts/generate-module`

[21:56] <patrickb> off to bed for me
