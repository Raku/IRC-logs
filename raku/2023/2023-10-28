[19:15] <ab5tract_> Ah, signature

[19:15] <lizmat> ::?ROLE not sufficient ?

[19:17] <tonyo> it's a method or sub?

[19:23] <tonyo> that seems like it should be BB though

[19:24] <ab5tract_> Yes it really does

[19:34] <ugexe> i dont think so

[19:34] <ugexe> `is AA` would pun the role into a class

[19:35] <ugexe> i think anyway

[20:52] <[Coke]> tried a fresh build of raku.land on my m2 mac. now it's hanging in the docker build when trying to run zef. I disabled the docker friendly BUILDKIT option so I should be getting the output of the commands, added a verbose to the zef... no output, it just spins after starting that command.

[20:55] *** jpn joined
[20:57] <tonyo> using `raku -e 'use Zef::CLI'` will let you run raku flags

[20:58] <ugexe> there is also RAKUDO_CLI_OPTS or some such

[20:59] <[Coke]> ... it's not that zef isn't generating output, as far as I know, but that the docker build is hiding any

[21:01] *** jpn left
[21:01] <ugexe> can you pick which version of zef it uses?

[21:02] <ugexe> the latest version of zef (0.20.*) had a change to the workflow, and i wonder if it could be related to that

[21:02] <[Coke]> ... maybe

[21:02] <[Coke]> what's a "safe" version? 0.19?

[21:03] <[Coke]> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/build-raku?ref_type=heads#L36

[21:03] <tonyo> leont++ .. going to look at that postgres module for the zef eco backend.

[21:04] <ugexe> yeah 0.19.1

[21:12] <[Coke]> making 0.19.1 the highest it uses doesn't seem to help

[21:27] <lizmat> ok, doesn't help me immediately

[21:27] <lizmat> do you have a localization file added ?

[21:28] <SmokeMachine> yes

[21:28] <lizmat> could you gist that?

[21:29] <SmokeMachine> sure, but if I remove that, the error continues...

[21:30] <lizmat> weird

[21:33] <lizmat> works for me :-(

[21:33] <SmokeMachine> odd...

[21:33] <[Coke]> lizmat: any plans/possibility for a translation script to convert betwen L10ns?

[21:33] <lizmat> did you see my lightning talk ?

[21:34] <[Coke]> maybe a local install is needed?

[21:34] <lizmat> it's all on core atm

[21:34] <[Coke]> Apparently not the whole thing!

[21:34] <[Coke]> i mean to say: if I have a program using one of the localizations, can I convert it to english, for example.

[21:35] <[Coke]> I didn't see that bit, but I was in and out for some of these, sorry.

[21:35] <lizmat> yes, $filename.IO.slurp.AST($lang).DEPARSE
