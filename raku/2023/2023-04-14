[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how to downgrade dist version with zef?

[09:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> more accurately, make sure that the version you are currently installing is the highest, or even only one

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, this would be easy to do for one dist (just uninstall it and install the right version, duh) - but is there something better when you have a whole depends list?

[10:11] <lizmat> there would be no need to downgrade if all module dependencies had been pinned: then providing your initial use statement with correct version should be enough

[10:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, and especially no need if you just tar all your dependencies with your software, duh

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> It's strange. I just made version 0.10.0 of MIDI::Make and fez handles it nicely, but there are problems with zef. If I install with zef it works, but if I do zef list, 0.10.0 is not ordered properly. it comes between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0, not after 0.9.0. Also, it does not show up on raku.land at all even though it was uploaded some 10 hours ago.

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> zef has it, but lists it in strange order and I wonder if that's why it does not show on raku.land

[14:51] <ugexe> zef list doesn't imply any sort of ordering, nor does zef search

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> raku.land still seems very much like a black box to me

[19:25] <moritz> you cannot initialize private attributes by passing them to new

[19:25] <moritz> make them public, so `has $.name; has $.age; has $.speech`

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's the least problem

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> self.name should downright fail - and it apparently does

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> that keeps the private private, but sets the value on new

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ++ I agree that gt is unsearchable on the new docs site ... also it is unlinkable unless you know to copy the target address of the left menu (which is oddly listed in operator precedence order) https://docs.raku.org/language/operators.html#infix_gt

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> or you can just use cmp 😎

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I just commented on an issue where it was kind of a feature that it was ordered by precedence 😅

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hopefully I can find that comment from Jonathan sometime where he says basically the same thing that I try to represent within this topic

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> namely that you should either coerce or overload but not mix the two

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if <=> stuff is established as Numeric coercer, at least the core shouldn't contradict that anywhere

[22:18] <kybr> if i have $supply.tap(-> { .say; sleep 1/7 }) the sleep does a yield or something smart, right?

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> which issue?

[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh it would be easy to set up some strict policy that  disallows these overloads

[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for example: $a > $b should be True if and only if $a + 1 > $b + 1 is also True

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I think that the new docs operator page needs a section on 'comparison operators ' akin to the existing 'assignment operators' that culls info from the perl to raku explanation

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> yep

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't think the bridge knows responses

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> raku precedence is very fine tuned and quite obscure to a casual viewer --- certainly not a good way to group the very long page on operators

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh it would be quite legit and undisputable - if the search worked alright

[23:21] <tbrowder__> weird; when i put that code in a script the increment becomes 1 instead of 3

[23:59] <tbrowder__> for now i've changed to using a loop (boo). so, how does one use a generated sequence in a finite iteration?WITHOUT  the increment and end point collapsing or being ignored?
