[03:40] <hythm> is `proto` NYI or I'm doing something wrong in the above example?

[03:43] <hythm> the only difference is I added `proto` before `token`

[11:54] <tbrowder__> ugexe: ref zef and RESOURCES, did hou say you were going to mod Comp* stuff so an author  can get a list of the "path" labels in a Distribution (%?RESOURCES) (or words to that effect)? that would be very cool. along with the App::Mi6 fix, all an author has to so is list a downloadable payload in dir resources (if i understand the whole thing).

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, exactly

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's the token there, squatting on the name of a built-in method, for no apparent reason

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not because calling .print on a Match instance would make any less sense than calling it on an Int - simply because the way things work currently, if somebody wants a token called print, it will install a method called print

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think the mere possibility of this conflict is bizarre enough - but this is more than a possibility, the example is right here

[18:26] <hythm> I'm getting an error trying to create rakuast node that accepts comma separated nodes (I mistakenly assumed I can pass a Seq of nodes), to explain what I'm trying to do, I created a gist where token1 works fine, but token2 gives error ` No such method 'visit-children' for invocant of type 'Seq'`

[18:26] <hythm> https://gist.github.com/hythm7/e47e868bc4b3be776b38125679b935cd

[18:26] <hythm> my question is how can I make something like token2 in the above gist work?

[18:28] *** dbonnafo left
[18:32] <ab5tract> hythm: what happens when you do |<a b>.map: … ?

[18:35] <hythm> `|<a b>.map` works!, thanks.

[18:37] <hythm> its funny because I tried `.Slip` after the map and got the same error, But I did not try `|` because I thought its equivalent to `Slip`

[18:37] <ab5tract> good luck! It’s encouraging to see RakuAST get some use

[18:38] <ab5tract> hythm: that’s usually the case but in function/method args I guess it is special cased

[18:38] <hythm> good to know

[18:39] <ab5tract> Otherwise you could never pass a slip as an argument

[18:40] <hythm> makes sense, thanks for help and explaining

[18:45] <ugexe> make sure you dont expect more than 65535 elements
