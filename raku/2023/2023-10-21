[11:34] <grondilu> Type theory is pretty cool.  I like how it's used to define integers out of natural numbers.  I wondered how it would be implemented in raku.  Here is a draft:  https://gist.github.com/grondilu/a9812e3a8abb904ea5202a19bd46f5d0

[13:25] <Voldenet> there's practical uses of natural numbers being types - once I needed (in C#) the "unique type" as identifier for DI use and ended up using natural numbers sequence

[13:29] <grondilu> lol now that I think about it, the way I implemented it is absurd memory-wise, I would end up making an instance for all natural numbers up to the highest I would need.

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh right

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 100 as a natural would create 101 instances

[13:30] *** dbonnafo joined
[13:31] <Voldenet> though at some point I switched to using 10 instances of digits and using Number<Digit, Number<Digit>> instead

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I asked the our class thing because there is our class Nat and class Int but the latter is also referenced with the fully qualified name somewhere below

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> perhaps it could be consistent

[13:32] <grondilu> @nemokoscch yeah.  In any case using instanciation is not really in the spirit of type theory if I understand correctly.

[13:32] <grondilu> I couldn't see how to make it work any other way, though.

[13:35] *** dbonnafo left
[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> behold, Anton Antonov incoming

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu "using instanciation is not really in the spirit of type theory" -- then try implementing in R not in Raku. (R designers prefer not to deal with fine granularities like scalars.)

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, since R is descendant of LISP, I wonder is Racket more suitable for type theory. (Than Raku.)

[13:43] <grondilu> I'm new to this anyway.  Can OOP be used to implement type theory?

[13:43] *** derpydoo left
[13:43] <grondilu> I mean superficially it looks so but what do I know.

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, sure. But OOP is just a paradigm. Meaning, someone/something should come up with OOP "design patterns" for type theory.

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And since "Interpreter" is well established OOP design pattern, one can argue, that of course OOP can be applied to type theory, at least via "Interpreter".

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> @antononcube you've worked on a Maxima parser, right?

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maxima!! ü§Æü§Æü§Æ

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, good guess! üôÇ Mathematica, though, not Maxima.

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Granted, they are very close...

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I've looked into Maxima recently, it doesn't seem so bad.

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And, I worked not on the Mathematica parser, but just on certain numerical algorithms.

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, Maxima is fine enough. (Again very similar to Mathematica.)

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But I did implemented parsers with Mathematica: https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/FunctionalParsers/ .

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Since I liked functional parsers so much, I also implemented them in Raku: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/FunctionalParsers

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> What I'm interested in is a CAS that I could use from raku.  Mathematica is a no-go as almost nobody will be willing to buy a license or install the Wolfram engine.

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Wolfram Engine is free for developer. And recently a team of two developed a very nice notebook interface to it.

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Do not get me wrong -- I would prefer Raku-native symbolics.

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And having Mathematica integrated with Raku, should give at least a good way of verifying symbolic implementations in Raku.

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Well a test suite using Wolfram engine for verification would not be hard to write.  You can always use shell commands.

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Please see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWeGkJU3wdM

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think it is less than 8 min long...

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> *watching

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I have no idea what ZMQ is.

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is used a lot for inter-process communications. For example Jupyter (notebooks framework) is based on Zero MQ (ZMQ).

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Is this like a virtual network layer?

[14:05] <tea3po> nah

[14:06] <tea3po> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queuing_service

[14:06] <tea3po> I think it's more like RPC

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu  https://zeromq.org

[14:07] <tea3po> I meant IPC not RPC I guess

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Why was it necessary?  Raku's IPC wasn't working?

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu I prefer "standard" solutions -- for me using ZMQ is standard solution. üôÇ

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, Mathematica uses ZMQ with all of its external language evaluators.  (Julia, Node.js, Python, R, Matlab, etc.) Meaning, if I want to program Raku as an external evaluator in Mathematica then I would use ZMQ.

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Which reminds me -- if you prefer to use Raku via Mathematica notebooks -- or chatbooks -- you can use the paclet "RakuMode" : https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/RakuMode/ .

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I'll tell you what I want to do and if you want you can tell me what method would be best.

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I have this geometric algebra module, https://github.com/grondilu/clifford, that I would like to improve.  Mostly making it faster.

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Every time I look it into it, I end up concluding it needs symbolic calculus.  I think the computations could be one shot so I'm thinking putting them in a BEGIN block or something.

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> so maybe I could connect to wolframalpha, so that users do not need to install Mathematica?

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Is it possible to submit arbitrary Wolfram code to wolframalpha?

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu I will address the last questions first. 1. You can use Wolfram Server or Wolfram Cloud 2. https://www.wolfram.com/application-server/ 3. https://www.wolfram.com/server-deployment-options/

[14:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Alternatively, you can do something similar to the following solution of mine: 1. Get Wolfram Engine (WE) -- again, free for developers 2. Make a Cro application that connects to WE 3. Expose the Cro serivice to end-users

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> That makes sense.  So I guess now I have no excuse not to work on it üòâ

[14:37] *** jpn joined
[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have discussed the Raku-Cro-WE solution in several movies: - "Doing it like a Cro" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1lqMDdeIY - "Raku for prediction presentation at TRC-2021": https://youtu.be/flPz4lFyn8M?si=Ml4UGgsiduI076pX

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu  Good luck! It is in my TODO list to experiment with symbolics in Raku, but I have too many side projects to that in the near future.

[14:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, "everyone" wants to talk to me about LLMs.

[14:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Well, except people from Raku's community...)

[14:46] *** nativecallable6 left
[14:46] *** nativecallable6 joined
[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> Well, I think LLM and symbolic calculus are related.  I expect LLMs to be trained on proof assistant languages eventually.  I would not be surprised if full automation in mathematics comes in a few years.

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting hopes! I am using LLMs to generate different mathematical models. (Currently) LLMs can be used to reduce the initial, kick-start work. But / otherwise, the hallucinated code / models / math needs to be verified and "not trusted".

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Basically, generate, mistrust, and verify. ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu  1. Do you use Jupyter notebooks? 2. Do you use Jupyter with Raku kernel? 3. Do you use Raku to access LLM services?

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I could never figure out this Jupyter thing.   I have a Mathematica license anyway so I barely see any use for Jupyter.

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> though I'm kind of tired of having to upgrade my license every time a new Mathematica version is out.  That's why I recently looked into maxima.

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Try the "RakuMode" paclet then -- if you have Mathematica version >= 13.2, it is going to be based on the Chatbook style.

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I have 13.0

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, to some extend that is why I developed the Jupyter chatbook solutions -- more people know how to deal with those kind of setup. (And want to continuously do it.)

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I'll look into Jupyter again some day, but I tend to stick to the terminal so I'm not sure I'll stick to it.

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a Jupyter chatbook (Python-based) that shows mathematical text generation and rendering at the bottom: https://github.com/antononcube/Python-JupyterChatbook/blob/main/docs/Chatbook-LLM-cells.ipynb

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I know Jupyter is fairly popular so I may be missing out.

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, that Jupyter notebook is a good example-artifact of the "less is more" triumph over "elite, superior solutions" (like Mathematica.)

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is this "last row"?

[17:52] <lizmat> nemokosch nom even predated my involvement, so I'm not sure who / what you mean by your last remark

[17:54] <lizmat> I mean, the "new" on nom is basically as new as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College,_Oxford

[17:55] *** jpn joined
[17:59] *** MasterDuke joined
[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I suspected that "new object model" is something about the metamodel

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> seems like it pretty much is

[18:01] *** jpn left
[18:07] <bartolin> I'm bewildered and also somewhat annoyed by these statements about historical mistakes. It feels like you speak badly about the past work of many volunteers. (I don't want to know whom you single out there.) I don't understand why you are doing that. And what do you mean by "historical mistake"? Do you think the old implementation (that was replaced by "nom") was better and should have stayed?

[18:08] <bartolin> Maybe (hopefully) I'm reading too much into this.

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know of a non-volunteer around this language. I am a volunteer and I'm pretty sure you are also a volunteer. I don't think this is a good excuse for anybody.

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The difference is that some people apparently have treated this project as "free lunch", not really taking it seriously the very moment it became uncomfortable for them

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's not really about what "contemporary" state existed

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the community took somebody's hobby work overly seriously

[18:12] <bartolin> Well, maybe I'm missing some insights. I've never heard that before.

[18:12] * lizmat neither

[18:12] <lizmat> also: I object against the phrase "hobby work"

[18:14] <lizmat> the fact that hardly anybody gets paid for what they do for Raku, does not make it "hobby work"

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> If somebody drops out every time any sort of inconvenience shows up, without feeling any sense of responsibility to the community, that's hobby work

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't even think it's fair to even call this "volunteering", it's just freetime fun activity

[18:15] <lizmat> people give what time they have, and some of us have a life

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm not talking about that, though

[18:16] <El_Che> this is turning dark

[18:16] <tellable6> 2023-10-19T18:08:47Z #raku-dev <jdv> El_Che the release happened

[18:16] <lizmat> then I'm unclear *what* you are talking about

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> When somebody feels no responsibility towards a project whose architect they pose as

[18:17] <bartolin> Maybe we shouldn't continue this discussion? I don't think that it will lead to anything good.

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That's really an extreme

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It's not exclusive to them, or even to this project, that there are people who inflate the meaning of volunteering to "I got no money for this so it's your fault to expect the least caring or quality"

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but that doesn't mean one cannot learn from it
