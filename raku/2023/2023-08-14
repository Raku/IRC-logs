[08:24] <Xliff> \o

[08:24] <Xliff> Is there a way to determine if an IO::Handle has any buffered data on it?

[08:25] <lizmat> I guess you could try introspecting the decoder

[08:25] <lizmat> but that could still mean buffered data at the OS level?

[08:25] <Xliff> Hmmm... how would that work?

[08:25] <lizmat> or isn't that what you meant?

[08:26] <Xliff> Well, I'm having an issue with a react/whenever block. Data is sent to an IO::Handle, but it isn't that responsive.

[08:27] <Xliff> I know there is data on it, but it is not getting through to the proper whenever block unless I kick it with a piece of stimuli

[08:27] <lizmat> IO::Handle has a has Encoding::Decoder $!decoder;  

[08:27] <Xliff> So how can I check it to know if it needs a .flush?

[08:27] <lizmat> well, if it's strings, it could be intentional

[08:27] <Xliff> It's now.

[08:27] <Xliff> s/now/not/

[08:28] <lizmat> I mean, a stream ending in "a" would not produce the "a" until it was sure that there are no trailing code points altering the "a" to e..g. "ä"

[08:28] <Xliff> I'd rather not indescriminantly .flush on a duration.

[08:29] <Xliff> Wouldn't such indescriminant flushing accomplish the same issue?

[08:29] <Xliff> Which is what I am trying to avoid...

[08:29] <lizmat> well, is your stream in :bin mode or not?

[08:29] <lizmat> if not, calling .flush won't help afaik

[08:29] <Xliff> Yes, it's in :bin

[08:30] *** teatwo joined
[08:33] *** tea3po left
[08:34] <lizmat> hmmm.....  then the decoder does not come into play   and I'm not sure if I can add anything anymore :-(

[18:52] <Xliff> Doctor, It Hurts When I Do This

[18:52] <lizmat> Doctor It Hurts When I Do This

[18:52] <lizmat> so don't do that then :-)

[18:52] <Xliff> *jinx* -- :)

[18:53] <Xliff> lizmat: Where's the fun in that? 

[18:53] <Xliff> I think my spirit animal is a cat...

[18:53] <lizmat> it takes a certain disposition :-)

[19:08] <gfldex> I'm reading the comments to the Gremlin-blogpost and came across: „Raku is Perl to the power of Perl.“. I want that on a T-shirt‼

[19:10] <lizmat> :)

[19:10] *** jpn joined
[19:12] <gfldex> Most of the other comments make me rather sad tho.

[19:14] <gfldex> It's depressing how many smart folk don't understand that all natural langues make a clear distinction between plural and singular and that most languages have a fairly clear difference between nouns and verbs.

[19:14] <gfldex> And they then use programming languages that do quite the opposite.

[19:15] *** deoac left
[19:17] <lizmat> I wonder how much of that is Stockholm Syndrome

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the practical meaning of DIHWIDT is "you aren't supposed to be doing that"

[19:35] <lizmat> I think it's more: it's unwise to do it

[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> isn't that more or less the same thing?

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> re "programming languages that do the opposite" - Ada. The language that is supposedly so safe and all, yet it literally masks type conversions, function calls and array accesses as the same thing.

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> This paradigm strikes me as the most nonsensical about the language. If they really wanted it to be readable, why did they overload even words like is, all and so much syntax

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, beating Ada is a bit convenient, does anyone really enjoy that language anyway. On a more relevant note: I think you don't get how these people (a lot of people, possibly even a majority) see Raku, or at least seem to show no understanding towards that sentiment...

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Yes, sure thing, many of them are just plain misinformed

[19:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> But the main, ever-returning theme is not the sigils or say, the coercions, I don't think so

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Remember when Linus Torvalds roasted C++?

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for a long time I didn't understand the gist of it, like what, C++ easy to write? this man is nuts

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> compared to C, it is easy to write, mostly the way Raku is easy to write, except like... Raku is magnitudes easier to write, in a large variety of ways

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you can have any crazy idea and Raku is a language that will back you up with it. This is fine as long as you are on your own.

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> And yes, this is where the "write-only" sentiment kicks in, which I also misunderstood for an embarrassingly long time.

[19:54] <gfldex> Refering to Stockholm Syndrome put the blaim on them or some unspecified 3rd party. How good are we at explaining the core ideas of Raku?

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Raku is not uglier than any other programming language; I'd personally say that mostly it is nicer - MY code is nicer, anyway 😝

[19:55] <gfldex> The first 2 paragraphs of https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction are really nice if you want to play bullshit-bingo or are really into marketing blurps.

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and this is the problem: "my" code is always nicer and you have to be "me" to understand and appreciate it's beauty

[19:56] <gfldex> We know a lot about Raku and then go about writing the docs for it. Is our target audience ourselves or folk who don't know the language well?

[19:56] *** hexology joined
[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it is "write-only" because when you write Raku, you only have to know your dialect of it, but when you have to read someone else's Raku code, you potentially need to know all Raku - which is a lot

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> as for gfldex's question, there is no clear concept on who the audience is

[19:58] <gfldex> I'm especially guilty of that. Most of my blogposts require a lot of context to make sense.

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's like the opposite of "golden mean". If you really want to know what is going on, you will end up browsing the implementation. If you just want to get an idea of the language, it will be too dreamy

[20:01] *** jpn left
[20:02] <tonyo> gfldex: link?

[20:02] <tonyo> to the blog post* 

[20:03] <gfldex> The original blogpost: https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/

[20:03] <gfldex> and the comments on HN https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37040681

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I have been thinking about actually doing a "Raku for anybody" kind of tutorial series, that would be my last resort anyway

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Having said that, I don't think turning the tide was a simple matter of education. I would be the most surprised if you could win over the people commenting those things.

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The point of education is simply to reach out to more people overall, that's still a good enough goal

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> fwiw i think the post initially feels like an attack on raku ... but actually the tone of the blog in general is quite questioning and i feel that the conclusion is somewhat positive ....

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> There are things that felt kind of painful (khm, documentation, lol) but I think all in all this is a balanced article

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and really, apart from "the documentation is really poor" and "I can't wrap my head around sigils", it is a reasonable representation of the language

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> gfldex: clearly, raku needs a paucal form :-)

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah, i agree - and i think that raku is actually a great beginner language (make the easy things easy) which is why i like the Think Raku book

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I also think Raku could be a good first language

[20:15] *** Xliff left
[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I do think there’s complexity to raku’s singular vs plural: arrays vs lists, etc

[20:15] *** teatwo left
[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I’ve been using Raku for almost 10years now and I still get bitten sometimes

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but anyway, if my fate is to be some rude-sounding Cassandra, so be it: the criticism of Raku in the article and on HN also needs to be at least considered

[20:15] <gfldex> It's also a really good languages for experts but really sucks for the folk inbetween. All those hidden defaults that make it nice to use for beginners that do simple things make it really hard to understand if you do fancy stuff.

[20:15] *** teatwo joined
[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that would be great for physicists - then you would have zero, one, paucal and infinite

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is a very apparent conflict of interest; I'm not sure if "Stockholm syndrome" is a good way to describe it, that's kind of condescending

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i reckon that most beginners are careful to be character perfect and do not test the guardrails - in that case baby raku can look and be very clean

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you want to achieve more individually or in a small indie team, you want a language that "let's you grow" and have fun

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> however, if you want to create/maintain code that is shared across a lot of people over a lot of time, you actually want to have something that builds up very solid core knowledge

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so preferably something small, strict and simple

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> gfldex: (i know we have some unfinished business that i hope to better understand and re-integrate your comments in a follow up to my post you commented on)

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Perl, Ruby and Raku are mostly created from the same mindset. Python is a reactionary language from that point of view.

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> C++ and D (to some extent even Rust) are created from the same mindset. Go is very loud about being a reactionary language (Zig as well but that's still in its infancy)

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i am an inbetweener and learn something every day (multi dimensional hash anyone?) ...

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> huh

[20:24] <gfldex> @lilibrasteve don't forget slurpy Semilists!

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the ||@idx syntax?

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: my %h;  %h{"a";"b"} = 42; dd %h;

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Hash %h = {:a(${:b(42)})} 

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ha!

[20:29] <gfldex> @librasteve see: https://gfldex.wordpress.com/2020/10/26/planned-obsolescence/

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .oO

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> > The ability of Raku to fix past mistakes was planned right from the beginning. This is also a "bullshit bingo" candidate, though

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It sounds very nice but should somebody ask how it manifests, and everybody would be in trouble

[20:33] <tonyo> gfldex: a lot of those comments seem to come from people unable to critique their own favorite languages

[20:34] <tonyo> "i often wonder what a language full of syntactic sugar looks like, now i know" /goes back to python

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i get the general feeling that the wider tone has gone from "perl6 is shit" to "raku - that's for gremlins"

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean, Python does have quite a considerable amount of syntax sugar, not sure how that appeared

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> its a reflection that the commenter doesn't know what syntax sugar is - since python is mostly syntax suger

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you know often I feel this is why I end up being in a vacuum. The original commenter didn't say anything about Python, that was tonyo's projection

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but it's pretty thankless to chase after whatever seems right

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People

[20:40] <tonyo> yea i mean it's just a common shift, the poster of that comment didn't mention python but it's apparent with python programmers when reading through issues.  it's common in go too where the idea is that you need code generators but somehow macros are evil and a badword

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that book seems like a must-read lol

[20:41] <tonyo> it looks like the commentor in that is mostly a C programmer, where macros are yet another form of syntactic sugar

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, I'm trying to make this point that it's not only cult mentality. There might be some cult mentality in there but there is pragma behind it

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ you using a spell checker?

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Daniel Sockwell made a presentation a couple of years ago, perhaps at FOSDEM

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That presentation was about how the structure of FOSS development is different from corporatist development. I think that was the right approach.

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i agree ...

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's much less that there is a Perlish cult and its arch-nemesis, the Pythonish cult - and much more that the corporatist world tends to reward certain social patterns within the technology

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's kind of a commonplace to say that Java is "the managers' favorite programming language"

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ... but there exist python | go | php | ruby coders who feel that they are in a golden cage

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> what do you think about the rust book?

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I for one don't know enough Rust to be able to decide whether it's more like C++ or more like Go

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> at first sight it seems obvious that it's somewhere inbetween

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no, my question is what do you'all think about the style / length / approach of that famous intro to rust?

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> like maybe we are missing a good, solid "raku book"

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah sure, I couldn't comment much on that

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> iirc the ownership part felt too marketing-ish xD

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you achieve "safety" by merely prohibiting whatever might be unsafe, you should at least make an attempt to explain that you don't miss out on something useful

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well, yeah I've spent the last 3 days knee deep in fsking rust ... it's just so unforgiving

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> why AlexDaniel?

[20:56] <gfldex> The problem with a good solid Raku book is that you would need a forklift to lift it.

[20:57] *** abraxxa-home left
[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well he's a great fan of Rust and always had a strong opinion about what may or may not be the goal of Raku

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no - what I mean is something pretty much the same length and conciseness (and that we need to rise to the challenge to compress)

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah again it seems that you guys don't have the same thing in mind. That's a very Raku thing to happen.
