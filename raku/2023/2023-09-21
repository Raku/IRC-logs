[15:19] <tonyo> anyone building rakudo on windows seen this error?  `3rdparty\libuv\src\win\fs.c:2065:47: error: 'FILE_DEVICE_CONSOLE' undeclared`?

[15:29] <tonyo> antononcube: are you the anton requesting tagging in the fez repo? i've responded to it there too but happy to chat here.

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> From what I know, it's a different Anton, a maintainer of Rakudo Star

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anton Antonov is antononcube on Github as well

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo No, I am not. ðŸ™‚ I try to use "antononcube" on my code-related works. (For Raku.)

[22:03] <tonyo> just for posterity on the FILE_DEVICE_CONSOLE error - make sure NQP ends up in the correct path

[22:03] <tonyo> after this should be able to set up a smoke tester for different raku versions and OSes
