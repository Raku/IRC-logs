[00:26] <Tirifto> Is the usual syntax for default attribute values not supposed to work in declarations of custom subclasses of List?
[00:27] <Tirifto> m: class Gold is Array { has Int $.carats = 0 }; say Gold.new.carats;
[00:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4dd493391: OUTPUT: «(Int)␤»
[00:27] <Tirifto> class Gold is List { has Int $.carats = 0 }; say Gold.new.carats;
[00:27] <evalable6> Tirifto, rakudo-moar 4b69dd51e: OUTPUT: «(Int)␤»
[00:28] <Tirifto> Oh wow, I had no idea camelia had competition. :o But anyway, is that intentional? Should that have been obvious from reading some part of the docs?

[01:13] <guifa_> Tirifto: it should probably be mentioned.  I believe the issue is that List and Array have special .new() 
[01:14] <guifa_> rather than default to Any/Mu's .new
[01:16] <Tirifto> Ah, so attribute defaults are dependent on .new. That makes sense, thank you, guifa_.
[01:16] <guifa_> either on .new or on one of the methods that get called by default by it (e.g. BUILD TWEAK etc)
[01:16] <guifa_> for instance, if you call
[01:17] <guifa_> Gold.new( carats => 1 ), how does it distinguish you wanting that from being the first item, or an attribute? 
[01:18] <guifa_> (technically, Pair.new('carats', 1) makes it a positional, and :1carats, carats => 1, :carats(1) make it named argument, but YMMV if relying on that is desirable)
[01:20] <Tirifto> Yeah, it’s fairly apparent when passing values to »new«. Less so with the defaults we put in class definitions, though, since however Raku makes those happen is not that obvious to the naked eye, or at least not to that of mine.
[01:21] *** jpn joined
[01:23] <Tirifto> One could suppose it’s just a way of setting default values for the .new method (or some such), but my first assumption was that it was more direct than that.
[01:23] <Tirifto> Though I haven’t attentively read through classtut recently. x)
[01:26] *** jpn left
[01:27] <guifa_> could probably do this a bit more elegantly with a trait but
[01:27] <guifa_> m: class Gold is Array { has Int $.carot; method new(|c) { callsame!defaults(|c) }; method !defaults(|c) { $!carot = c<carot> // 1; self } }; Gold.new(1,2,3).carot.say; Gold.new(1,2,3).say; Gold.new(1,2,3,:4carot).carot.say
[01:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4dd493391: OUTPUT: «1␤[1 2 3]␤4␤»
[01:28] <guifa_> so first one you can see the default value of one is set, the next one shows an actual array is produced, and the last one shows the :4carot being interpreted as a default value
[01:28] <guifa_> err as an attribuet value
[01:42] <guifa_> okay
[01:42] <guifa_> so I can't find a way to get the default value of an attribute
[01:42] <guifa_> but this will probably be much cleaner for you
[01:44] <guifa_> m: role Subarray[*%defaults] is Array { method new(|c) { callsame!defaults: |c }; submethod !defaults(|c) { .set_value(self, c.hash{.name.substr(2)} // %defaults{.name.substr(2)}) for (self.^attributes (-) Array.^attributes).keys; self } }; class Gold does Subarray[:0carot] { has Int $.carot }; Gold.new(1,2,3, :4carot).carot.say; Gold.new(1,2,3).carot.say, Gold.new(1,2,3).say
[01:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4dd493391: OUTPUT: «4␤0␤[1 2 3]␤»
[01:46] <guifa_> now all you have to do is include that role, and you can just say `does Subarray[ attribute => default-value, attribute => default ]`.  You have to repeat the attribute name in the Subarray parameterization and in the attributes, but otherwise fairly clean
[02:05] <guifa_> hope that helps a bit :-)

[22:30] <Tirifto> guifa_, thank you for those examples! For my current use case, a class with an array as an attribute will probably work fine, but your last example shows magic I wouldn’t have though of, and it’s very interesting to read. :-)
[22:31] <[Coke]> https://raku.land/build has a few errors that could maybe be tickets on distros.
[22:32] <[Coke]> e.g. github: Could not resolve to a Repository with the name 'tony-o/p6-db-xoos-mysql'.
