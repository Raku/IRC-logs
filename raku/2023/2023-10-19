[01:53] <guifa> m: say $_ with 1 andthen say "bye"

[01:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 55952f679: OUTPUT: «bye␤True␤»

[01:53] * guifa is decidedly unsatisfied with the way Raku parses that

[01:56] <guifa> postfix modifiers aren't listed in precedence (fair, they're not an operator), but I feel like their precedence should be tighter than loose and/or

[01:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> why do you feel that, though, if they are on a whole different conceptual level admittedly?

[01:59] <guifa> to me, loose and/or are supposed to be *so* loose that they allow entire statements

[02:00] <guifa> recall they're designed to be event looser than assignment

[02:01] <guifa> m: my $a = 1 and $a = 2 and $a = 3 and say $a # obviously, Raku doesn't even complain about using $a in its own declaration!

[02:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 55952f679: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[02:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> since assignments are really just expressions in the language, that feels like nothing extraordinary to me

[02:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> however, making expressions that are so meta that they can contain statements, that sounds quite unsettling

[06:29] <melezhik> roguerakudev: I agree.  All - my apologies for the yesterday conversation got a bit edgy. nemokosch: I think it's be better if you still have any questions on Sparky - then you may file an issue/question via Sparky GitHub repo, I don't feel comfortable to discuss this here with you in irc, for the reasons I mentioned yesterday. However I am ready

[06:29] <melezhik> to help you with tool if you want to use it, I just think it's be better to have such a discussion via GH repo channel rather than here. So you can layout all the details/problems there and where we can have more productive conversation. Thanks

[15:37] <[Coke]> do non-US shipping companies send you an alert saying that something is shipped when they have just created a shipping label but not actually moved the box?

[15:37] <[Coke]> (sorry I know that's OT - you're one of my few sources of non-US data!)

[15:37] <tonyo> us companies do that a lot too

[15:38] <tonyo> dolan bikes also did that for me, ships from the UK.  also charged me for VAT but never bothered paying it

[15:38] <[Coke]> ... Sorry, that was my implication: I just got another "in transit" when it really meant "printed label" from a US company

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> melezhik: I hope you are alright. I'm sorry if you didn't feel the conversation was productive. For what it's worth, I spent some time figuring things out afterwards, and it seems there is a functioning workflow now. There is a lot of finetuning that could be done probably but for the time being I'm going to stick with the current way.
