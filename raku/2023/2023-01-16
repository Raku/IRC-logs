[03:11] <Voldenet> I can see it's progressing a bit though

[03:11] <Voldenet> some versions ago this `m: role s[::T] { submethod CALL-ME(T $s) returns T { $s }}; say s[Int](1)` wouldnt work

[15:15] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/01/16/2023-03-advent-radux/

[15:17] <guifa> [Coke] nice one on the Slang::Date (but on raku.land it shows up as Slang:Date instead, typo? ) 

[15:17] <guifa> If I hadn't've been gone this weekend I would have made it after seeing the one post earlier in the weeek on date literals

[17:28] <[Coke]> that was the inspiration, yes. :)

[17:29] <[Coke]> I have fixed the name in git, will push an updated release.

[17:35] <guifa> There's still two things I need to do in the DateTime category and might be useful for a slang too

[17:35] <guifa> (a) class Time {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}

[17:36] *** dakkar left
[17:37] <guifa> and (b) explicit no-timezone timezone (where it morphs to the timezone of any datetime that it does math with)

[18:33] <tonyo> ispyhumanfly: what version of fez are you on?  an update may fix it if you're below 37

[18:33] <tonyo> `fez -v`

[18:45] *** sena_kun joined
[18:52] *** jpn joined
[18:54] <ispyhumanfly> tonyo: I'll give that a shot now.

[18:55] <ispyhumanfly> tonyo: danstephenson@Dans-MacBook-Pro raku-dotenv % fez -v

[18:55] <ispyhumanfly> >>= fez version: 39

[18:56] <ispyhumanfly> It's super weird. Yes I'm totally new to fez/zef. I've been out of the Perl/Perl6 loop for a few years. So I'm still getting acquainted.

[18:58] <ispyhumanfly> tonyo: https://github.com/ispyhumanfly/raku-dotenv is the project I'm working on if that helps.

[20:23] <melezhik> Hi! I am thinking moving from digital ocean droplet VM which costs me $56 prt month pre tax for 4 cpu ( dedicated chip ) and 8 ram. I am thinking about cheaper provider and probably increase RAM to 12-16 GB. Any recommendations?

[20:25] <El_Che> melezhik: if you can stomach oracle get a free arm64 VM with 4 Arm-based Ampere A1 cores and 24 GB of memory 

[20:28] *** jpn joined
[20:28] *** melezhik left
[20:28] *** melezhik joined
[20:29] <melezhik> El_Che: interesting, can I install Rakudo and MySQL there ? Which distro they use ? And it is suspiciously free ))))

[20:30] <El_Che> melezhik: https://www.oracle.com/be/cloud/free/#always-free

[20:30] <El_Che> change accordingly for location

[20:30] <El_Che> it's a vm

[20:30] <melezhik> Ok üëç

[20:30] <El_Che> you run the OS you want

[20:31] <El_Che> you can have 2 small amds and 1 big arm with the disk capacity they give you

[20:31] <El_Che> minimal 50 gig for a vm

[20:31] <El_Che> or 1 big with all the disk space

[20:32] <El_Che> rakudo on arm does not have jit

[20:32] <El_Che> but is not that slow

[20:32] <El_Che> (I had to script the arm machine request because you only can claim one when resources are available. But once you have it, you can keep it and its IPs if you  don't destroy it.

[20:32] <El_Che> )

[20:36] <melezhik> So, the machine will stay forever ? What about IP address , do they provide you with static IP address ? I need the one

[20:36] <El_Che> yes and yes

[20:36] <melezhik> Ok

[20:36] <El_Che> the interface takes some getting used to, though

[20:37] <El_Che> but once setup (networking ,firewalling, etc) you don't have to deal with it and you just ssh

[20:37] <melezhik> So the only possible issue is this arm and Rakudo may be slow ?

[20:37] <El_Che> and that my packages are there but not yet in the repos

[20:38] <El_Che> https://cirrus-ci.com/build/6700332659507200

[20:38] <El_Che> need to automate that last bit

[20:38] <El_Che> have been too busy atm :/

[20:38] <melezhik> I mean my ultimate purpose is to move ci.sparrowhub.io from digital ocean

[20:38] <El_Che> yeah. I got that :)

[20:39] <El_Che> check if you don't hit the free limits

[20:40] <melezhik> 3,000 OCPU hours and 18,000 GB hours per month

[20:40] <melezhik> What does the second refers to?

[20:40] <El_Che> disks?

[20:41] <El_Che> my machines are always on

[20:41] <El_Che> the time is more than a month

[20:41] <El_Che> I meant mostly traffic

[20:41] <El_Che> https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm

[20:42] <El_Che> translation: 2 amd ocpu and 4 arm64

[20:42] <El_Che> (under available shapes)

[20:44] <melezhik> Ok, I will probably need to experiment with all that and see if it feasible for my current setup

[20:46] <El_Che> good luck
