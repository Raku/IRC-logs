[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> inherit multiple classes without writing 'is' repeatedly, though i've realized that what i wrote wouldn't work with the idea of reduction operators

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> if reduction were to work with 'is', it would have to be class Action is [is] Abstract, Thing {

[12:57] <tonyo> it's doable in this way but probably just as ugly as a bunch of `is`es

[12:57] <tonyo> m: role A { method a {"a".say;} }; role B { method b { "b".say; }; };  class C { method c { "c".say; } }; C.HOW.add_role(C, $_) for [A,B]; C.^compose; C.new.b

[18:37] <tbrowder__> .ask lizmat i would like to use File::LibMagic but it fails testing in the symlinks. I

[18:37] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[18:38] <lizmat> tbrowder_: worry, but I've only ported that module to modern Raku a while ago, I have no recollection of what and how it does things

[18:38] <tbrowder__>  it looks like it's a problem the original author wasn't happy with. can we cut that test for now?

[18:39] <tbrowder__> i'm happy to do that cause i want the other stuff it provides

[18:39] <lizmat> sure, but what it really needs is a maintainer  :-)  It hasn't been touched significantly since 2016  :-(
