[09:18] <lizmat> the problem with gists is that they have limited discoverability

[09:18] <Xliff> And unfortunately, I don't know any BQN community. I may have to look into one. The only reason I got interested in BQN is because of a codesection video.

[14:51] <tbrowder__> btw, the only functions in module "AlgorithmsIT" at the moment are for string pattern matching. maybe useful somewhere in core. algo is by Dr Knuth et al.

[14:51] <tbrowder__> coleman: maybe for a young person :-)

[14:52] <coleman> :)

[14:56] <lizmat> tbrowder__: have you considered making ArrayOneBased a subclass of Array?

[14:57] <lizmat> class A1B is Array { method AT-POS($pos) { $pos ?? nextsame !! die }; method iterator() { callsame.skip } }

[14:58] <lizmat> which would just not use slot 0 in an array

[15:17] <[Coke]> I just submitted a PR for raku.land on github after not using gitlab for like 10 years.

[15:19] <[Coke]> ... not true, I commented on some stuff 4 months ago

[15:19] <Tirifto> japhb, I could see all of those! Running Hexchat on Debian 12 right now. :-)

[15:26] * [Coke] tries to get raku.land running locally, but the docker requirement is a showstopped on m2 macs, I think.

[15:26] <[Coke]> *er

[15:30] <avuserow> Docker desktop should run on the apple silicon macs

[15:31] <tonyo> [Coke]: i use podman on mac silicon

[15:34] <japhb> Tirifto: Ah good!  So I take it your normal working system is *not* Debian 12.  :-)

[15:35] <Tirifto> japhb, it is, actually! Personally, I experience few issues with Unicode. It’s just that the program I’m writing should, of its own volition, output ASCII only. x)

[16:24] <japhb> AH!

[16:24] <japhb> Now I understand.

[16:26] <japhb> Tirifto: Now that Terminal::LineEditor can adapt its symbol usage to a Terminal::Capabilities object (see latest version of both), you should be able to just tell it you have an ASCII terminal and should automatically downgrade.

[16:29] <Tirifto> japhb, oh, that sounds very useful! Does that affect its ability to read Unicode whatsoever (if the terminal does support Unicode, but I just want it to prefer ASCII characters for whatever reason)? :o

[16:30] <japhb> Tirifto: Nope, it's only affecting the symbols it uses for its own output; input (and in particular, correct Unicode handling) is unchanged.

[16:32] <Tirifto> japhb, thank you, I’ll be sure to give it a try then! :D

[17:55] <[Coke]> when running raku.land locally, does the zef deps install thing save state over invocations (it's very slow the first time)

[17:55] <[Coke]> s/thing/step/

[17:57] <ugexe> you can pass --serial to have each module install one-by-one after their tests pass instead of installing all modules only once all modules tests have passed

[18:00] *** reportable6 left
[18:00] <ugexe> you can also try setting --test-degree=5 or some such to test in parallel (although since parallel module loading can segfault --test-degree defaults to 1)

[18:01] *** reportable6 joined
[18:06] <[Coke]> ugexe - does --/test imply serial?

[18:07] <[Coke]> guessing no, and it probably shouldn't (other issues can occur besides test failures)

[19:08] <uzl[m]> re youtube channel: Will the channel be managed by the Raku foundation or is it simply a contributors managed channel? I can set it up easily but I'm not sure what it entirely entails

[19:09] <uzl[m]> Awesome!!!

[19:10] <coleman> isn't there already a TPRF channel?

[19:10] <lizmat> I think we should have someone actively involved with that
