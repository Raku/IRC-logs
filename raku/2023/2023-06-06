[20:20] <tbrowder__> tonyo: yep, i saw it. thnx

[20:24] <tbrowder__> i'm trying to create an operator for my OneArray class which is looking pretty good, but i want it to have its own []= operator which i think has  to have a method something liepostfix<[]> ($index,

[20:28] <tbrowder__> like this: method postfix<[]>(|args) { sub circumfix<=>(|args)  { ... }" but not sure how to unpack the args...

[20:38] <tbrowder__> in the meantime i'll fake it!
