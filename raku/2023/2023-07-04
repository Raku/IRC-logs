[20:07] <ugexe> technically "if a module is installed" is not the same as "if a module can be used" :P

[20:08] <ugexe> the other suggestions using `require`  are may not be ideal if you are otherwising using the module in question, since it would be loaded (and error) before the runtime require

[20:10] <ugexe> if you just want to optionally load a module though, then yeah that is probably what you want

[20:12] <ugexe> thats another way to do it at runtime

[21:24] <tbrowder__> happy Independence Day for all US ppl here

[21:25] <tbrowder__> ugexe: i have a module with 

[21:26] <tbrowder__> a Build that works fine on my dev hosts but not in workflows on github.

[21:27] <tbrowder__> it is supposed to create or check file in a user's $HOME directory, and it does so for me.

[21:29] <tbrowder__> however, it doesn't seem to do anything when run at github (i have looked at a debug r

[21:29] <tbrowder__> should it work, in principle?

[21:30] <tbrowder__> or is $HOME off base on github?

[21:33] <ugexe> can i see your code?

[21:34] <tbrowder__> it's at https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory/Build.rakumod

[21:35] <tbrowder__> i can gist it if you want

[21:36] <tbrowder__> that link doesnt have

[21:36] <ugexe> well, you don't have all your dependencies listed

[21:37] <ugexe> https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory/blob/06bde3cea16d1fe7855f8fae11663424341ad7d0/bin/ff-gen-list#L3-L10

[21:37] <ugexe> are all of those listed in META6.json?

[21:37] <ugexe> because your Build.rakumod runs that script, and so you'd need those dependencies installed

[21:37] <ugexe> presumably they are already installed on your local system

[21:37] <ugexe> but on a fresh system (i.e. github actions) they wouldn't be installed. and they won't get installed without being listed in META6.json

[21:38] <ugexe> if you run zef with --debug it might show you whatever error it is getting

[21:40] <tbrowder__> i thought they were but i'll dbl ck. thanks. (actually i thought mi6 would catch those things). i'll report back results.

[21:40] <ugexe> also i dont see you running `zef build .` in your github action

[21:40] <ugexe> so its also possible the build step is never taking place that way

[21:41] <tbrowder__> oh? ok. i'll check that after seeing about the other stuff. thank you!

[21:55] <tonyo> .

[22:05] <tbrowder__> i just added the missing build step.and some missing deps...now waiting

[22:13] <tbrowder__> that worked as advertized--thanks for the help, Nick!

[22:14] <tbrowder__> just in time for fireworks, hot dogs, and cold beer!
