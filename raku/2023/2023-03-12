[00:41] <Voldenet> rf: I like the stash, but accessing it by string is not very great performance-wise
[00:41] <Voldenet> m: for ^100000 { my %h; %h<what> = 42; for ^100 { %h<what>++; }}; say now - BEGIN now
[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 301ca0dcd: OUTPUT: «1.246504761␤»
[00:41] <Voldenet> m: my %x = :what(1); for ^100000 { my $n = %x<what>; my @h; @h[$n] = 42; for ^100 { @h[$n]++; }}; say now - BEGIN now
[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 301ca0dcd: OUTPUT: «0.62027981␤»
[00:41] <Voldenet> using array for stash is massive performance boost
[00:42] <Voldenet> and lookup can be mapped into array's index just once
[00:42] <Voldenet> the "stash-item" -> "index" can be mapped only on middleware starting up and can use some global session for the stash
[00:43] <Voldenet> s/global session/global hashmap/
[00:45] <rf> Hmm, I want it to be fairly usable though
[00:45] <rf> I think you would expect to get stuff from the stash with named keys rather than indices
[00:47] <Voldenet> consider such syntax: `sub middleware-session($app) { my $session-stash = $app.reserve-stash<session>; sub aux() { $lock.protect({ $session-stash.rw = %sessions{$session-id} }) })`
[00:48] <Voldenet> it's even possible to still have the by-dictionary hash
[00:48] <rf> Ah, nice.
[00:48] <Voldenet> basically, the array could implement associative role in a way that would delegate things to a hash
[00:49] <Voldenet> but middlewares with reserved stash item index could use this performance trick
[00:49] <Voldenet> and use the array directly
[00:50] <Voldenet> but imo most middlewares wouldn't have problems reserving their own stashes first
[00:50] <Voldenet> and dict-stash would be pure overhead, since the stash entries are going to be relatively static
[00:52] <rf> Thanks for this feedback I will play around with this idea
[00:53] <Voldenet> hm, now that I think of it, the bigger problem is that hash keys are going to allocate themselves per request and might end up being bigger than data
[00:53] <Voldenet> especially if you store bools/ints in that stash
[00:55] <Voldenet> so it's good to not allocate them at all :)

[16:10] <rf> .tell ugexe Is it possible to hookup zef to Jenkins or Nexus?
[16:10] <tellable6> rf, I'll pass your message to ugexe
[16:15] *** jpn left
[16:26] *** merp left
[16:26] <ugexe> what do you mean
[16:26] <tellable6> 2023-03-12T16:10:52Z #raku <rf> ugexe Is it possible to hookup zef to Jenkins or Nexus?
[16:27] *** merp joined
[16:28] <rf> Like if I wanted a private dist for a business or something but still have it installable by zef
[16:29] <rf> For example in Java gradle, I'd just have to add the location of my builds to my build file and then gradle would look there if it couldn't find them in the main ecosystem
[16:31] <rf> If `zef install <private-git-repo>` works that would work too I guess.
[16:31] <ugexe> one way is to pass the url to `zef install MyDistDependingOnFoo https://github.com/private/repo/foo.git`. the other way is to add a config entry to https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/5345b9183928184aea9cd9cf6d26a057039d5df9/resources/config.json#L26-L38 that points to the private repo
[16:31] <rf> Thanks! The latter is exactly what I'm after
[16:32] <ugexe> i.e. you can use a Zef::Repository::Ecosystem plugin pointed to a remote or local json file of array of hash
[16:33] <rf> ugexe++

[16:59] <tbrowder> hi, question: since rakudoc is to be the "pod" for Raku, has anyone started an effort to allow "rakudoc" as an alias to "pod" as in "=begin/=end rakudoc" interpreted in raku code as being the same as '=begin/=end pod'? that probably should be done as a branch off the raku ast branch i assume.

[17:41] <rf> So turns out Humming-Bird is about 12% faster than Mojolicious with my basic tests :D
[17:42] <rf> Maybe I should add "blazingly fast" to the readme
[17:43] <jdv> i'd be skeptical.  why not hit up @sri about measurements.
[17:43] <jdv> i think there's a mojo channel
[17:49] <rf> I'm just blasting it with ~2000 req/sec it drops around 31% HB drops around 19%, over 500 seconds
[17:50] *** jpn joined
[17:53] <rf> It is also worth mentioning I HB provides about a 5th of what Mojo does so it's not really a fair comparison I guess

[19:52] <patrickb> ugexe: I'm curious. What came of your Zef Grant idea?
[20:01] <ugexe> patrickb: Yeah I need to revisit that... my laptop crapped out on me when I was originally making those plans and it fell on the back burner
[20:02] <ugexe> $work has since provided me with a personal laptop to do open source with though (maxmind++) so that isn't a problem now
[20:03] <patrickb> Ok. Thanks for the update. I do like what the grant is aiming for.
[20:04] <patrickb> maxmind++ indeed
[20:08] <rf> ugexe you work at maxmind? Neat. I applied there last year when I was looking for a new job.
