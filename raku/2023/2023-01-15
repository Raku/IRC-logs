[18:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> is there any practical difference between a module's "long name", "module specification" or "identity"? Are these terms pretty much synonymous?

[22:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean

[22:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> looks like fake templating

[22:46] <rf> I'm just seeing if there is a way to do what @atroxaper is trying

[22:47] <rf> I'm not sure it is possible

[22:55] *** sena_kun left
[22:56] <rf> atroxaper: I would just avoid the type system in this case. I had a similar problem writing my result monad library, but in the end I think it gets more in the users way to type like this.

[22:56] <rf> But there may be a way, but I am not sure.
