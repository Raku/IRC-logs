[10:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> judging by #raku-dev-irc , this might be a fez problem

[10:09] <lizmat> it is confirmed to be a fez problem

[12:03] <ab5tract> m: module M { our sub m { dd $?MODULE; dd $?MODULE::.kv }; module B {}}; M::m; dd M::.kv 

[12:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6235256a5: OUTPUT: «M␤()␤("B", M::B, "\&m", sub m { #`(Sub|5546014211456) ... }).Seq␤»

[12:04] <ab5tract> that behavior for $?MODULE::.kv feels strange

[12:05] <lizmat> what specifically do you find strange ?

[12:05] <ab5tract> m: module M {}; dd GLOBAL::.kv; dd $?PACKAGE::.kv

[12:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6235256a5: OUTPUT: «("M", M).Seq␤()␤»

[12:06] <ab5tract> lizmat: does this make it clearer? ^^

[12:07] <ab5tract> Shouldn't `::.kv` always access the stash and give back its contents?

[12:08] <ab5tract> I would expect GLOBAL and $?PACKAGE to be equivalent

[12:08] <ab5tract> (in my example)

[12:10] <ab5tract> but then, I would also sort of expect this to work: 

[12:10] <ab5tract> m: module M {}; ::("GLOBAL")::.kv

[12:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6235256a5: ( no output )

[12:10] <ab5tract> m: module M {}; dd ::("GLOBAL")::.kv

[12:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6235256a5: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[12:14] <ab5tract> I came across this when trying to make a method for a role that would introspect $?PACKAGE::.kv to find anything defined under a class's namespace

[12:17] <lizmat> fwiw, I think nine found some anomalies there while working in RakuAST

[12:17] <ab5tract> ah, nice

[12:46] <uzl[m]> I've merged this PR into main: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4284

[12:47] <uzl[m]> Good job with the article! You dialed it up a bit when talked with supply, react/whenever, etc. I mean at least for me :')
