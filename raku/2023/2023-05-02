[14:44] <[Coke]> using raku with git bash very frustrating as I often find myself getting paths with \s in them, which work fine in Raku, but then I can't easily print them out and do something with them in the shell.

[14:48] <[Coke]> any recommendations for dealing with text files that could be in UTF8, 16, or 32?

[14:49] <[Coke]> I assume "loop over encodings until one doesn't throw an exception" is easiest.

[15:16] *** zara joined
[15:16] <Woodi> [Coke]: probably easiest is to ignore bad files ;)

[15:16] *** zara left
[15:17] <Woodi> however I don't know what consequences of that can be...

[15:20] <[Coke]> right, but encoding in utf16 isn't "bad", just not the default.

[15:29] <Woodi> in my opinion it's binary, just like office docs :)  but iconv or enca counts as loop ?

[15:31] <[Coke]> I don't want to convert the files on disk, but read them in as a Raku string that I can then use JSON::Fast (e.g.) on. 

[15:33] <[Coke]> so I am now explicitly doing that (utf8 then utf16) to see if I can decode the file, and as soon as I have a decoded file, I (clean it up because it might be JSONC and not pure JSON) call JSON::Fast to convert it to a Raku object from JSON.

[15:37] <ugexe> I think as part of fixing long paths on windows we might want to normalize path separators to forward slash on windows

[15:37] <ugexe> since \\.\ style paths have to use forward slash unlike C:\ style paths

[15:37] <ugexe> and if we want to just prefix all paths with \\.\ they will have to be normalized anyway

[15:39] <[Coke]> Any modules/core functionality to let me search through nested hash-like things for a key at any level?

[15:39] <Woodi> [Coke]: stackexchange says: undetectable, sometimes manual intervention needed even if load success...

[15:40] <[Coke]> Woodi: you mean, if you have to guess the encoding rather than knowing for sure?

[15:46] <Woodi> you can guess wrongly becouse numbers can fit into incorrect encoding. knowing is only way :)

[15:47] <Woodi> but maybe in 99% guesses could work :)

[15:49] <Woodi> human intervention needed, so far AI can't help :)

[15:56] <[Coke]> CATCH question: I have a script with a loop; inside that loop is a CATCH; also inside that loop is another loop with it's own CATCH. If an exception is thrown in the inner loop - should both CATCHs fire?

[15:56] <lizmat> only if the inner CATCH doesn't handle it?

[15:57] <[Coke]> ok.

[16:00] <[Coke]> Weird: using File::Find to get a file; one file is now throwing an adhoc error about no such file or directory when then trying to open it. Doesn't look like it's because of LONG_PATH.

[16:00] *** jpn left
[16:00] <[Coke]> .... I really am at a point where I need to do all this in a linux VM instead of trying to make it work on windows. :(

[16:51] <kathe> hello. :)

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh hi

[16:52] <kathe> when is a good time to mention something while affording maximum reach?

[16:53] <[Coke]> it's IRC, so whenever and people can react in backscroll if they're not here... but EU work day is probably when you get most people online here.

[16:54] <kathe> okay. can you suggest time in 'gmt'?

[16:54] <[Coke]> no. just ask the question. :)

[16:54] <kathe> i fully acknowledge your comment about backscroll.

[16:54] <kathe> i do not have a question.

[16:54] <[Coke]> not that I don't want to, but no one has that specific info.

[16:55] <kathe> but rather, i want to apologize, publicly. right here.

[16:55] <kathe> around 1~1.5 years back, i had ranted against raku on this channel itself.

[16:56] <kathe> i had also thrown around attitude due to my large experience year count.

[16:56] <kathe> i had belittled raku and dissed a few people.

[16:56] <kathe> for all of that, i apologize.

[16:56] <kathe> this is an unconditional apology, and i offer no excuses.

[16:56] <lizmat> kathe: thank you for your words

[16:57] <lizmat> what nick where you using then ?

[16:57] <kathe> i don't remember.

[16:57] <kathe> i had 3 and have deleted 2 and retained on this one now.

[16:58] <[Coke]> Thank you. I'm sure people will see this in backscroll, thank you.

[16:58] <lizmat> well, I guess it's all water under the brdge

[16:58] <kathe> if anyone wants to trace my identity, my website is at https://kathe.in/

[17:00] <kathe> i have to leave now. but, i'll pop in occassionally.

[17:00] <kathe> currently too tied-up with family's health issues.

[17:01] <kathe> hope and expect to engage more meaningfully around 4~5 years from now.

[17:01] <kathe> i just didn't want to wait all that long to apologize. hence now.

[17:01] <lizmat> kathe: I guess this is you? https://irclogs.raku.org/search.html?oldest-first=True&nicks=mayuresh&channel=raku

[17:03] <kathe> yes yes. that _was_ me.

[17:03] <kathe> how come my handle still exists in spite of being deleted?

[17:03] <kathe> 'irc' continues to mystify me.

[17:04] <lizmat> kathe: it exists in the logs that were kept

[17:04] <lizmat> and that website makes them searchable

[17:04] <kathe> just a tip. get a copy of "irc hacks" by mutton. amazing book.

[17:04] <kathe> lizmat: cool. thanks.

[17:08] <kathe> bye all.

[22:04] <guifa> [Coke] You can check initially for a BOM, if present, it will guarantee format of the text file

[22:05] <guifa> 0000feff or fffe0000 is utf32, feff or fffe is utf16, and efbbbf is utf8

[22:06] *** jpn left
[22:19] <guifa> Otherwise, if yuo can make assumptions about the text, you can probably figure it out via various heuristics.
