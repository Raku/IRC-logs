[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Does this help: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_parser#Raku

[09:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Here is the "URI" repository: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/URI

[09:18] *** jpn joined
[09:50] <Xliff> antoncube: Thanks, but no. Those are only useful for when you already have the URL.

[09:51] *** siavash left
[10:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I see. This makes me think I have to include a ‚ÄúURL recognizer‚Äù in ‚ÄúText::SubParsers‚Äù.

[10:22] *** sena_kun left
[10:22] <Xliff> antoncube: That would be nice.

[10:22] <Xliff> antoncube: Take a look at the this repository - 

[10:22] <Xliff>   my token url {

[10:22] <Xliff>     [ $<scheme>=<nodeParts>+ '://']?

[10:22] <Xliff>       [ $<user>=<nodeParts>+ ':' $<pass>=<nodeParts>+ '@' ]?

[10:22] <Xliff>       $<host> = [ (<nodeParts>+) ** { 2 .. Inf } %% '.' ] 

[10:22] <Xliff>       [':' $<port> = \d+ ]?

[10:22] <Xliff>     [

[10:23] <Xliff>       '/'

[10:23] <Xliff>       (<nodeParts>+)+ %% '/' '/'?

[10:23] <Xliff>       ['?' <kvPairs>+ %% '&' ]?

[10:23] <Xliff>     ]?

[10:23] <Xliff>   }

[10:23] <Xliff> Ack!

[10:23] <Xliff> Let's try this again -- https://replit.com/@Xliff/PigishlyURLDetection

[10:23] <Xliff> antoncube: That's detecting most if not all of the URLs I can think about.

[14:11] <tbrowder__> hi, given a list @arr, how do i show all  items except the last 3? i know i can do this clunky way: my $n = @arr.elems, ..., but how do i do that in this fancy form: .say for @arr['some magic rakuism']

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder @arr.head(*-3) ?

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think @arr.head(* - 3) would be one way

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> damn

[14:21] <tbrowder__> [] instead of ()?

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> head is a method

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Does this work?  @arr[^(*-2)]

[14:23] <tbrowder__> not yet

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> seems to me it actually does

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It should be @arr[^(*-3)]  -- and, yes, I just tried it.

[14:25] <tbrowder__> yes, it does. thanks

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> fair fair

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> off-by-one errors

[14:26] <tbrowder__> i also got this to work: say $_ for @arr[0..*-4]

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ yeah, but precision in Raku counts...

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm kinda surprised that works but it does

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 0 .. * would be a range but 0 .. * - 1 is a WhateverCode

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Yeah, I just used the range shorthand because CommaIDE nags about it.

[14:27] <tbrowder__> i like yours. anyone have fewer chars between the []?

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Well, I a thinking now that I should parse and interpret in my DSLs statements like these : 1) "show all elements but last 5", 2) "give me all list elements except the first 2".

[14:31] <tbrowder__> cool

[14:31] <tbrowder__> i'm trying to show debian bash experts a better way ;-D

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it would be hard to show them a worse way than using shell

[14:33] <tbrowder__> agree!!

[14:34] <tbrowder__> thanks, folks, using anyononcube's way is best cause the 3 is the key point

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks @tbrowder! And --- in your face @nemokosch! Take that! You were too slow!!

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwnT2AGMMMc

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks! (Also thank you for mentioning chromatic earlier, I followed the links from Liz's post.)

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> chromatic was a core engineer (if not THE core engineer) of Parrot

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> frankly it's a "just asking for a coffee" situation

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure what do you mean. üôÇ I am asking for coffee all the time : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/antonov70

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> same

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean that you can chill while these people are (rightfully) criticizing each other's work, lol

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see -- yeah. üôÇ

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch The official video seems to have all elements we discussed today: LLMs, arrays. coffee. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6BEkPzstJQ

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I didn't link it because there are weird censorships in the vocals

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's creepypasta material

[14:51] *** teatwo left
[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh, I see, I noticed that, but I thought is the download speed.

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it would be a good idea to get that album, though

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> damn it, there was a disc market just yesterday

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> didn't know

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Legion of üí•"

[14:56] <tbrowder__> antononcube: a sensitive question on yr recent speech in russia, any sense of Russian  scientists' opinions on invasion?

[14:57] <tbrowder__> back later..

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I have a short answer and long answer. üôÇ

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not sure who said it but I've heard that Rust's famous type safety is a bit overclaimed because it actually disallow doing things that people do want to do

[17:44] *** tea3po left
[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and therefore a considerable amount of unsafe code is written anyway

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> how this is relevant? I don't know, probably it isn't, just something that bugs me
