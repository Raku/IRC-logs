[22:31] <lizmat> tonyo: I hoped that japhb would have done that by now  :-)

[22:47] <ugexe> tonyo: government regulations like the cyber resilience act, are calling for regulations where a lift of all the parts used to build a piece of software might be a requirement (or part of a set of requirements).  if someone wants to use raku in such an environment we want to be prepared to have that type of information available
