[02:13] <tellable6> 2023-10-27T02:54:19Z #raku <japhb> Xliff Since we're going back and forth super slowly and I'm on really weird hours right now ... how about opening an issue in the GitHub repo for your questions, and we can have the discussion there?

[02:13] <tellable6> 2023-10-27T18:34:09Z #raku <gfldex> Xliff I got rewarded with "Stage mast       : Object does not exist in serialization context", while building Rakudo. #raku-dev could not help.

[02:15] <Xliff> .tell gfldex That usually stems from when you try to serialize an object that isn't a @, % or Cool-based $

[02:15] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to gfldex

[02:15] <Xliff> .tell gfldex You'll get that if you do something like: "unit package A; class B { has $.c }; our $c; BEGIN $c = B.new"

[02:15] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to gfldex

[02:16] <Xliff> .tell gfldex That also extends to the contents of any @ or % value you are trying to cache at BEGIN time.

[02:31] <vrurg> Xliff: no, it's abandoned.

[02:31] <vrurg> Need an addition to the README, actually. 

[02:31] <Xliff> vrurg: So it's not usable at all? Do you have a recommendation for something else?

[02:32] <Xliff> Shucks! Found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXg2y4_3W4w and got excited...

[02:32] <vrurg> Certainly not usable. It never really was as it was incomplete from the start.

[02:32] <Xliff> Ah, well.... thanks for the talk. Is there another project you could recommend for TUI?

[02:33] *** inquinn left
[02:33] <vrurg> Not sure. Look for Terminal::Widgets, don't know where is it now.

[02:33] <Xliff> Thanks.

[02:34] <vrurg> Heh, but it was really fun with Vikna. 

[02:42] <Xliff> I might try and take a stab at it.

[02:42] <Xliff> BTW - Term::termios has a broken build plan.

[02:42] <Xliff> I had to grab the distro and install it manually... :/

[02:45] <Xliff> Yeah. I need a ScrollView and simple frames.... :/

[04:09] <tellable6> hythm, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[04:10] <Xliff> hythm: Actually, precompilation is a bit of a pain. My projects are large enough that if there are sub precompiles it throws off the bargraph.

[04:11] <Xliff> hythm: My current module doesn't advance the bargraph at all until it completes precompilation.

[04:11] *** jpn left
[04:12] <hythm> can you share your current module, I will try to reproduce and take a look

[04:12] <tellable6> 2023-10-29T03:32:48Z #raku <Xliff> hythm How does Pakku calculate it's bargraph for the STG phase? It's not working as I'd like for my second project.

[04:13] *** buildable6 left
[04:13] *** buildable6 joined
[04:13] <Xliff> hythm: I think it's how the modules are compiled. It looks like it goes through <provides> in alpha order of the key.

[04:13] <Xliff> It's better if it goes in dependency order, but the only way I can think of doing that is adding to META6.json

[04:14] <Xliff> hythm: Going by alpha order means it hits the ::Application class first, and that subcompiles most of the distro.

[04:15] <hythm> hmm, let me take a look at p6-GIO

[04:15] <Xliff> Thanks!

[04:19] <hythm> not related but looks like p6-GIO depends on `p6-Glib` but there is no a distribution with that name

[04:20] <hythm> I think you meant `Glib`. the depends section should list the name of the dependency as its specified in the `name` key in META6.json

[04:20] <Xliff> LOL. I just committed that fix.

[04:20] <hythm> haha ok

[04:35] <hythm> not able to install p6-GIO due to compilation error

[04:36] <hythm> `No such method 'absolute' for invocant of type 'Slip'

[04:36] <hythm> I'm running debian 10

[04:38] <hythm> If you like we can discuss this in github issue instead of going back and forth here in the channel

[04:38] <Xliff> Hrmmm....

[04:39] <Xliff> What is the location and name of your libgio.so file?

[04:40] <Xliff> Currently I only have library data for Ubuntu because that's what I am on.

[04:41] <Xliff> Is yours a symlink to libgio-2.0.so.0?

[04:43] <Xliff> hythm: Can you make an issue for this on https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GIO ? 

[04:43] <Xliff> I'll fix it, tomorrow. Thanks!

[04:44] <Xliff> And I'll create an issue for Pakku. I'd like to get that issue solved, if possible.

[04:46] <hythm> sure

[12:14] <tbrowder__> no, i cannot get that to work inside an installed distro. is that a zef or raku bug?

[12:15] <tbrowder__> or can someone get it to work?

[12:17] *** buildable6 left
[12:18] <tbrowder__>  my code is in https://github.com/tbrowder/Demo.git

[12:19] <tbrowder__> i'm fi

[12:20] <tbrowder__> maybe a work-around for the installed version is to check the %meta...

[12:20] *** buildable6 joined
[12:27] <tbrowder__> no, .meta only has keys of ver, auth, and api

[12:38] <leont> Finally had some proper sleep, wish i had had that a day earlier

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> What was the matter?

[13:44] <ugexe> and you can access other keys from .meta that you aren‚Äôt seeing because they are lazily generated 

[13:45] <ugexe> but .meta<provides> works 

[13:46] <ugexe> All the tools you are working with work. If they appear not to work, then you‚Äôre doing something wrong 

[13:47] <ugexe> Are you sure you‚Äôre even seeing an exception and not a warning?

[13:48] <ugexe> You have a CATCH block still despite using try 

[13:49] <ugexe> Just assume that the distribution related code works, and any issue you see isn‚Äôt related to it. That is going to allow other people not familiar with the distribution code to feel more comfortable giving you suggestions 

[13:51] <ugexe> m: try { die 123 }; CATCH { default { say $_ } }

[13:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar bd53ad250: ( no output )

[13:51] <ugexe> it looks like that is one thing you are doing 

[13:52] <lizmat> m: die 123; CATCH { default { say $_ } }

[13:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar bd53ad250: OUTPUT: ¬´123‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[13:55] <ugexe> To be clear the above (Lizmat‚Äôs comment) is not what you are doing tbrowder 

[13:56] <ugexe> I‚Äôm honestly not sure how putting CATCH in the mainline works either like you have 

[13:57] <ugexe> normally you would put a catch block in the most specific scope possible. So in your case somewhere inside the resource-exists function itself 

[13:58] <ugexe> I‚Äôm typing on a phone so I‚Äôm a bit short

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> Hi All! Is there any way to set up a local repository and get zef to install local modules specified in "depends" in META6,json? Maybe something similar to Pinto in Perl (https://metacpan.org/pod/Pinto )?

[23:39] *** buildable6 joined
[23:44] <ugexe> the zef config allows adding other repositories and ordering them in the way you think is more appropriate. you basically give it a module and implement the interface and it will dynamically load it https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/782cdda3e70779fec5bc34db746388a14ee0adc5/resources/config.json#L26

[23:51] <ugexe> no one has written step by step instructions, no. i guess you can read https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/jsld9w/help_me_understand_zef/ and i've answered other such questions elsewhere with similar answers

[23:52] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> Cool! Thanks for the help!

[23:52] <ugexe> i know there is a github issue under zef somewhere with similar (and maybe more) info but my search-fu isn't finding it

[23:53] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> OK, I'll take a stab at finding that as well. Thanks again!

[23:59] <ugexe> the main thing is creating that repository yourself
