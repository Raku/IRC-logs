[02:12] <guifa> tonyo: any update on the fez backend?  I'm still trying unsuccessfully to push an update to Intl::CLDR.  I did a fez -v upload and it seems everything was pretty successful including the upload portion, so it feels like it might be the backend

[04:18] <tonyo> the grant i'm trying to submit is to rewrite and open source the backend, in the process we'll get better error messaging (read: instantly upon upload)

[16:24] <Geth> ¦ advent/main: Add blog post by pheix

[16:24] <Geth> ¦ advent/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/advent/commit/d4f6b8a0e7

[16:25] <lizmat> down to three!  :-)

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I can volunteer making an advent post. (I planned a few blog post already, each between 60% and 75% finished.)

[16:31] <lizmat> antononcube that would be great!

[16:31] <lizmat> first open slot is the Tue 19th

[16:32] <lizmat> if you could have one by then, that would be great

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok. I will prepare a Markdown version today and/or tomorrow, titled something like "Streamlining AI vision workflows" (with Raku), or something similar.

[16:34] *** jpn joined
[16:35] <lizmat> antononcube: ok, please make a gist somewhere and I will take care of the rest

[16:36] <lizmat> or send it by mail to me

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Good -- you answered a question I was going to ask. (I am/was reading this: https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/raku-advent-2023/authors.md )

[16:39] *** jpn left
[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mmm... I meant to say that I was reading : https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Now, this statement/advice is in "CONTRIBUTING.md"  > Note that it is recommended to have each paragraph in the markdown source file collapsed into one long line before using one of the html converter tools listed in the next step. That is necessary in order to get the html formatting correct (Wordpress doesn't remove newlines inside html text content).

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am thinking -- maybe I should make add a "translator" to "Grammar::Markdown" that just converts text paragraphs in to one-line paragraphs.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, "Grammar::Markdown" has an HTML translator which I use for posting at WordPress, but translator does not handle images given in Base64 format well. (For example, pandoc does.)

[16:52] *** epony left
[16:52] <lizmat> antononcube what's your WP user name ?

[16:53] *** epony joined
[16:53] <lizmat> I can give you access to the advent blog, so you can work on it there yourself

[16:53] <lizmat> "rakuforprediction" isn't  cutting it

[16:57] <lizmat> found it, sent invite

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Just accepted the invite. Thanks!

[17:06] <leont> How do I declare ar class with a custom HOW again?

[17:08] *** jpn joined
[17:16] <lizmat> leont: you mean also replacing the "class" keyword with something else ?

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Okay, back with another fun one - is there a way to use a BEGIN block or similar to define a variable to later be used in a use?

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Basically, I won't know at the time of writing the code which things I need to use (because this is for loading plugins), but it is determinable at startup time

[17:26] <ugexe> why would you 'use' plugins instead of 'require' them?

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> require works to

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> too*

[17:26] <ugexe> one is explicitly compile time, one is run time

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Oh, I didn't realize that

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I always thought the different was something to do with importing symbols

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Nice, that works

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Rog: just a thought, but use and require import at a lexical level (ie inside a block) - so you can put the require inside a block inside (eg) an if (condition) { require Your::Import } and then only run the block if condition == True

[17:39] <ugexe> that isn't entirely true... require leaks through scope

[17:41] *** dbonnafo3 joined
[17:43] *** dbonnafo2 left
[17:44] <ugexe> maybe ignore what i said... i know that is true for some edge cases but generally i guess its fine to assume it

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ugexe: my bad --- I had assumed that require == use in terms of the block scope

[17:49] <ugexe> the comment there seems to suggest what i just said about leaking scope is correct tho

[17:57] <ugexe> librasteve: it is probably fair to suggest to people that it is. i'm just whining about some edge case really :P

[19:03] <leont> No, I actually know how to do that, and I suppose I could have solved it like that. But to be honest I am overkilling it again and shouldn't solve my metaprogramming needs in an easier way
