[01:07] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tony-o: It's usually not recommended to put system specific files like .DS_Store in the .gitignore of individual projects. Usually, you put it in the global gitignore file. I wonder if fez could have a hard-coded list of such files to always ignore. I know on MacOs there is really just that .DS_Store, not sure about other systems. The problem is many might just forget to put it. I have it setup in my global

[01:07] <discord-raku-bot> ignore, so had no idea they were even around.

[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tony-0 : Am I correct in assuming fez will add all files that have been saved and not in the local .gitignore to the package, including things you saved but have not committed?

[15:26] <tonyo> pelevesque: yes that is correct

[15:31] <tonyo> pelevesque: i don't want to recreate the git functionality, you can use git to make a dist if you prefer that bundler (using: git archive, be advised this only bundles committed files).  there is a default list of things fez ignores but if it finds a .gitignore then it uses that list instead

[15:32] <tonyo> you can upload that bundle using `fez upload --file <path-to-file>`

[15:40] <tonyo> .tell xliff these svg docs from mdn aren't very consistent, you may find some issues with types when you start trying to use the SVG in Ryml

[15:40] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[15:41] <tonyo> thank you

[15:51] <lucs> tonyo: I was talking with @pelevesque yesterday, and the idea of using git-archive seemed appropriate given his context, but I seem to remember you saying something about deprecating the --file option (or something)?

[16:05] <tonyo> nah, file will stick around for exactly that purpose ^

[16:05] <tonyo> i know that it cannot be 100% dwiw so it'd be a bad experience for folks if i removed it

[16:13] <lucs> Yeah, good idea.

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tony-o Is it possible to add .DS_Store to the files that fez ignores automatically? Or maybe have an entry in fez's config json file to add files we wish to ignore? I'm trying to find a way to ignore system specific files like .DS_Store,  or folders like .vscode, etc... without having to add them to my project .gitignore

[16:42] <lucs> @pelevesque: Meep. git-archive should be easy to set up a bundle.

[16:47] <lucs> Having fez parse .gitignore to exclude files is a courtesy, but may be a bit misleading since for the upload to match the module's git repo, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude would also have to be considered.

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tony-o Yes, but if we can add files for fez to ignore in fez's config, then no need for git archive. fez upload would be fine.

[18:01] <tonyo> pelevesque: there's going to be some config in the .fez file that will follow strict globbing rules, i could make it so those get evaluated _in addition to_ rather than _instead of_

[18:03] <tonyo> the globber entry for the config option i have planned would be `**/.DS_Store` rather than just `.DS_Store`

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Yes, **/.DS_Store is the way.

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Sounds awesome
