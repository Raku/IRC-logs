[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I'm aware, I presumed that was the intention as kicking the bot from IRC which lizmat mentioned would've resulted in the same at more extremes
[08:12] *** ispyhumanfly joined
[08:12] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> kicking the bot from IRC? you can just mute him on discord?
[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I can, the concern was lizmat suggesting that since they don't have the power to do that on Discord, which isn't as unexpected as it sounds due to this server only recently starting to be more moderated as compared to before when it almost completely lacked moderation
[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I'd assume the IRC side isn't in touch with the Discord side's moderation at all
[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> by that i mean reading his msgs after that point sorry must've clarified
[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> yes. only change has been that his messages from thereafter aren't bridged to IRC by the bot
[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> it'll be reverted after 24 hours manually
[08:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> maybe I should've went for the IRC-Readonly role instead, but I wasn't really given any specific guidance on how to handle this form of scenario in particular, so I did what seemed suitable at the moment

[10:22] <lizmat> Let me explain my dilemma both on #raku as well as on Discord
[10:22] <lizmat> 1. I appreciate the energy that Nemokosch is throwing into the Raku Programming Language project
[10:24] <lizmat> 2. Initially, their participation was mostly about starting discussions, which in some cases, where about things that were discussed in what is now the Raku community for over a *decade*
[10:25] <lizmat> 3. Some of these relate to the Perl roots of Raku, from the time that Raku was still considered by many to be the successor of Perl
[10:26] <lizmat> 4. Some of the issues that were raised by them, I can agree with, at least partially
[10:27] <lizmat> 5. Unfortunately, they have a tendency of not taking "no" for an answer, even if that "no" is perhaps a "not now"
[10:28] <lizmat> 6. This results in people getting tired of these discussions, especially if the apply to things discussed in the past ad nauseam
[10:30] <lizmat> 7. Also unfortunately, they have a tendency to make things personal: on the one hand, because there is a lot of *I* in the issues raised
[10:30] *** sena_kun left
[10:30] <lizmat> 8. And, although I agree it is a platitude, I do think the idea behind "There is no I in "team" is sound
[10:32] <lizmat> 9. So I would like to see them cooperate more, rather than "fight" to get their point across
[10:33] <lizmat> 10. Having them on the other end of the Discord bridge, also means there is no way for me to discuss things in private messages
[10:34] <lizmat> 11. So the only way to ask for toning it down, is to do this publicly, which then only results in yet another public discussion
[10:35] <lizmat> 12. This resulted in me not really reading backscroll on #raku anymore, as it had become work, and I don't do that so much anymore
[10:36] <lizmat> 13. Then I received reports from different people that they too were not happy with the atmosphere on #raku, due in a large part to them
[10:38] <lizmat> 14. Last night, I *was* paying attention, and saw it going off the rails again
[10:38] <lizmat> 15. I warned them, and as usual, only got the beginning about another discussion, in which I did not want to take part publicly
[10:39] <lizmat> 16. I kicked the bot, the bot recovered, the discussion continued, I kicked the bot again
[10:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> ...I apologize for that, the bot is set to auto-rejoin
[10:39] <lizmat> Zephyr that's ok
[10:39] <lizmat> it was more like the real "yellow card" as it were
[10:40] <lizmat> 17. and the rest is a 24 hour silencing of Nemokosch on #raku
[10:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> Nemokosch your messages are currently still not bridged, if you'd like to have a conversation with lizmat I suggest going on the IRC side and using private messages for the time being. as for myself, I'm not here to take any sides as mentioned, just trying to keep things running. also, if you'd rather have a proxy-talk with lizmat publicly here via me I'd want both your confirmation and lizmat's permission for that
[10:47] <lizmat> I'm fine with a proxy-talk
[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> alright, that leaves Nemokosch's confirmation, @Nemokosch would you want me to be a proxy and give sorting things out another chance?
[10:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> they have turned the offer down and decided to not discuss it for the time being, apologies
[10:51] <lizmat> Zephyr no problem
[10:51] <lizmat> you've tried your best and it is appreciated

[13:41] *** ispyhumanfly left
[13:42] <tonyo> is json fast recursive or single pass?
[13:45] <tonyo> much different than it was in the JSON::Faster days
[13:45] <rf> Tbh I couldn't really decipher what it was doing, I think its using some sort of caching.
[13:45] <rf> I wonder if its faster to take the MD5 of JSON before you parse and store it as known

[14:09] <thundergnat> My entirely unsolicited take on the Nemokosch situation.
[14:10] <thundergnat> Seems like a very smart individual, with a lot of interesting observations, but comes across as dismissive and confrontational when people who have worked on those very issues say "Yes, but.
[14:10] <thundergnat> Someone disagreeing with you is not neccesarily a personal attack.
[14:10] <thundergnat> While I don't want to appeal to authority, sometimes people who have been working on it for 10+ years really do have a better understanding of the problem space and the trade-offs that have been made.
[14:10] <thundergnat> On the other hand, he has a lot of energy and has enlivened the chat channels quite a bit, (not _always_ in a good way, but pretty often.)
[14:11] <thundergnat> Honestly, he reminds me of early Zoffix, before he stopped drinking heavily. High energy, lots of interesting ideas, not much filter.
[14:11] <thundergnat> I would be sad to see him go. I think he brings a lot of potential, but I also agree that he does on occasion make it feel "less fun" to be here. :-(
[14:11] <thundergnat> (Which may be a non-sequitur because I am not actually "here" all that often, though I do enjoy reading the logs pretty regularly.)

[14:20] <MasterDuke> rf: btw, nine said it isn't supposed to be possible to create a raku hash and return it via nativecall. jnthn's suggestion was to"return, say, an array of values and build the hash back in Raku space."
[14:20] <MasterDuke> "Although it seems the API of simdjson is more iterator based, so it may make more sense to consume that directly in Raku (that is, iterate to produce the hash)"
[14:21] <[Coke]> Would love to include this as a potential how-to on the docs site for nativecall if someone wanted to write it up as an example. :)

[14:25] <melezhik> Hi devs! My previous comment on the Nemokosch situation for some reasons got lost . Anyway I would second thundergnat and hythm views on this. Just my 2 cents here - I see him more trying to help and being really passionated about the language rather then _intentionally_ trying to disrupt the order in the channel, however I am ready to accept his
[14:25] <melezhik> style of communications might be improved ))) if people say so. Anyway it would be sad to see him going because if some ( sometimes unavoidable) tractions ...

[17:40] <[Coke]> does anyone have strong feelings about whether docs in moarvm, nqp, and rakudo should be in pod6 vs. md? I think it makes sense to always have a README.md (LCD), I think it makes sense for our public facing language docs to be pod6, but I don't think we're standardized elsewhere.
[17:40] <[Coke]> (question triggered by seeing we have two release guide docs in rakudo/rakudo, one of each kind, one with -, one with _...)
[17:41] <coleman> I like README in md and everything else in pod6?

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> on the NK situation, there are two dimensions: active-inactive and positive-negative ... NK sits in the active/negative position and this makes the situation very awkward
[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> in any social context we each need to be self aware and prepared to adjust our behaviours according to feedback
[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I worry that the first contact a new visitor to raku-beginner (or raku-irc) will be a negative take on the features of the language, delivered very quickly... the situation is made worse by the wider audience / better discoverability on Discord (which generally I see as a good thing)

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> it has been 24 hours since Nemokosch was excluded from the bridge. however, at the state of how things currently are, there appears to be no changes on both their and the opposing peoples' stances. I'm afraid reverting the bridge's state will cause more controversies currently. since there's no proper way for the IRC side to moderate users from the Discord side or block/ignore them, for now I think I'll keep Nemokosch
[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> excluded from the bridge until a more reasonable alternative is provided that allows for things to be less chaotic. it's night time in my timezone unfortunately, so I'll have to go sleep now. I'll continue reading any related discussions when I'm online

[21:43] <shmup> what's the diff between t and xt, for test dirs?
[21:44] *** jgaz left

[21:44] <shmup> i se a comment in the xt sole test saying: "# These tests should be moved to t/ once perl6 is faster" 
[21:48] *** swaggboi left
[21:50] <cfa> i think xt is for author/developer tests, not intended to be run by users at the time of installation
[22:05] <rf> I've seen and used it as well, for integration tests

[22:19] <tonyo> xt is meant for things like you need your environment set up a particular way for testing.  ctilmes' has a lot of modules that use xt (like the libpostgres stuff) because testing requires postgres set up in a particular way

[23:09] * leont really likes the convention of subdirs in xt, like xt/author/ or xt/release/, makes it much more obvious which test is run when
