[01:05] <MasterDuke> you know, i've never tested if --optimize=0 gives faster startup. but it won't be just for precomp

[01:06] <MasterDuke> ugexe might have a suggestion

[01:17] *** jpn joined
[01:22] *** jpn left
[01:33] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> --optimize doesn't seem to matter on 0 vs 3

[01:36] <MasterDuke> hm. what about `--optimize=off`? there's a chance that will break things though, the current (i.e., non-rakuast) frontend actually does some correctness checking in the optimizer

[01:54] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> That is actually a bit faster (roughly 14s vs 15s)

[01:56] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I just remembered the existence of --stagestats and it says I'm spending all the time in parse.

[01:57] <MasterDuke> you also could try disabling the jit with these environment variables, MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 for the whole thing, MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1 to just disable the expression/template jit

[01:58] <MasterDuke> that's not surprising. grammars are probably rakudo's slowest thing

[02:00] <MasterDuke> my dream is that they'll get some hard-core attention after rakuast is finished, but it's not at all trivial

[02:03] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I'll give that a try in a bit, thanks for the pointers

[02:03] <MasterDuke> np

[02:04] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Luckily this isn't a blocker for this project, I'm just interested in seeing if it can be better for a better developer experience. It's serviceable on a 10-year old laptop processor so that's actually not so bad ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[02:06] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Maybe with RakuAST I could write some macros to lazy load modules in dev mode but eagerly in prod.

[02:08] <MasterDuke> yeah, that might be possible
