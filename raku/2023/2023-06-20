[18:22] <tonyo> tbrowder_: i'd reckon the best way to deprecate a module is to put that information in the readme.  the dists, once uploaded to fez, aren't changeable after 24 hours and this window is for the "oops" scenario.  using tags or something else might be inadvisable because it isn't alterable easily - what is the goal of deprecating those modules?

[19:30] <molotov> Hi, guys! I'm looking for an answer on the next question: is there a bitfields support in the CStruct?

[19:31] <molotov> If the answer is "no", then is there a way to emulate them?

[19:33] *** jpn left
[19:49] <ugexe> even if one wants to deprecate a module, that should not imply any change in behavior of resolving that dependency

[20:28] *** thowe joined
[20:30] <tonyo> if you mean an int:1 then it seems like a work around (assuming it doesn't _just work_) is to mask the first defined :1 for the field you want (eg if it's at position 2 in the struct: $mystruct.field2 == $mystruct.field1 ^+ 0b10)
