[02:20] <melezhik> .

[02:21] <melezhik> .tell rf on "git submodule update --recursive --remote" - you probably might need "cd source/" first

[02:21] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to rf

[02:21] <rf> Yeah I just fixed it

[02:21] <rf> Thanks :D

[02:21] <melezhik> cool

[02:23] <rf> melezhik: source directory does not yet exist, download source archive from storage

[02:25] <rf> Hmm I think I can bind CMake to this and have it work nicer, one sec.

[02:26] <melezhik> I think, you need adjust sparrow.yaml a bit - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/8152b9eb4171cdc76eda2fb264eb6b82

[02:26] <melezhik> `depends:` should be a list

[02:26] <rf> I see

[02:27] <rf> One sec I think I can make this simpler.

[02:27] <rf> On my end.

[02:27] <melezhik> in case you want a tasks depends on many tasks

[02:27] <melezhik> yeah, sure

[02:28] <rf> Yeah I am not that good at Yaml too haha sorry for spamming Sparrow

[02:31] <melezhik> that is ok )) this is what this channel for

[02:31] <melezhik> but I understand your pain with YAML )))

[02:32] <rf> I have hard time understanding the '-'

[02:32] <rf> Not sure why it is there.

[02:32] <melezhik> `-` ¬†just means next element in the list

[02:34] <rf> Yeah, just not very normal for me lol. My github CI passes now, so hopefully Sparrow likes the new changes

[02:34] <rf> Build time may be a little longer though.

[02:34] <melezhik> basically if one needs to declare array of hashes they would do this:- https://gist.github.com/melezhik/912984f841241587132a514e9854d2a0

[02:34] *** frost left
[02:35] <rf> Forgot one thing lol, now it should work...

[02:38] <rf> Hmm, timeout. Submodule is fairly big.

[02:41] <melezhik> yeah, I rerun the build from admin console , let see how it goes this time

[02:41] <rf> I think it should be under 5 minutes, sorry lol

[02:41] <rf> I ran on 1 core machine, about 3.6minutes

[18:52] <lizmat> that's not a pastebin

[18:52] <lizmat> anyways, lose the @   make it $initial-name-parts

[18:52] <lizmat> and use binding

[18:53] <rf> https://pastebin.com/QmgBpwtw here's the func.

[18:55] <lizmat> if you're using nqp::list, you should really always be binding

[18:55] <lizmat> but state doesn't allow that  :-(

[18:56] <lizmat> so: state $name-parts = nqp::list(|$name.split('‚êü', :skip-empty));

[18:56] <rf> Hmm.

[18:56] <lizmat> my $initial-name-parts := nqp::list(|$name.split('‚êü', :skip-empty));

[18:57] <rf> I'll give that a go, thanks liz

[18:57] <lizmat> do you really need it to be a state

[18:57] <rf> It would be nice.

[18:58] <rf> Is there a nice alternative without global state?

[18:58] <rf> (I'm not opposed to global state)

[18:58] <lizmat> ok, then you could assign the nqp::list to a state variable

[18:58] <lizmat> and then bind the deconted list to another variable each time

[18:58] <rf> Makes sense.

[18:58] <lizmat> so: state $state-parts = nqp::list(|$name.split('‚êü', :skip-empty));

[18:59] <lizmat> and then: my $name-parts := nqp::decont($state-parts)

[18:59] <lizmat> in general: onlt use $ sigils, or no sigils when working with nqp ops

[18:59] <rf> Then if I re-assign the state, do I just use =

[19:00] <lizmat> yes, = is the only thing that works on state variables

[19:00] <lizmat> now, if you then need the deconted version after that, you would to rebind the deconted version as well again

[19:04] <rf> I'll see if I can get it working :D

[21:24] <pingu> I just wanted to check if the third parameter per line in my file are multiples of 8

[21:25] <pingu> even if they are say 1,9,17,25 rather than  0,8,16,24

[21:28] <pingu> or even 17.44 , 25.44 , 33.44 , 41.44

[21:29] *** freeside left
[21:29] *** Guest8418 joined
[21:32] <pingu> ok I might have fixed it

[21:32] <pingu> it was a code structure aka logic problem

[21:32] <pingu> thats like the hardest thing in software development

[21:32] <pingu> not syntax, not math, logic

[21:36] <pingu> ah but now its false triggering

[21:36] <pingu> if I made them not 8 apart

[21:45] <pingu> im sick of comma IDE not updating the fucking syntax highlighting

[21:46] <pingu> it makes if white it I miss certain characters but fails to change back all the time if I fix it

[21:47] <pingu> maybe I need to change the autoparse delay in settings

[21:47] <pingu> whatever that is

[21:49] <pingu> but it needs to also print how many hits were made, not how many hits - 1 were made

[21:50] <pingu> and it needs to do it in one statement, not like: "found 0 hits""found 1 hits""found 2 hits""found 3 hits""found 4 hits"

[21:50] <pingu> I fixed that by moving the print out of the loop

[21:50] <pingu> but now its like I cant for other reasons

[22:03] <pingu> ill unroll everything

[22:04] <pingu> it wont let me divide by 0 using %

[22:04] <pingu> but % 8 returns nothing

[22:04] <pingu> % 0 would check if its a whole number

[22:04] <pingu> not if its divisable by 8

[22:05] <pingu> (i think)

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> nothing is divisible by 0 (apart from arguably 0 itself)

[22:15] <pingu> oh wait

[22:15] <pingu> I posted the file contents

[22:15] <thundergnat> ?

[22:16] <pingu> data_ldr is splitting it into tokens

[22:21] <thundergnat> I can only guess at what in in @data_ldr[0][3] and @data_ldr[0][13].  I assume they are the 4th and 14th elements of each line, but that works when I do that.

[22:22] <thundergnat> Somehow the contents of @data_ldr[0][3] and @data_ldr[0][13] are not what you think they are.

[22:22] <pingu> 0 3 is 0 and 0 13 is 3024.dat

[22:23] <pingu> err 0 14 is 3024

[22:23] <pingu> which is what I have

[22:24] <thundergnat> Are you sure? 

[22:24] <thundergnat> .words does not split on decimal point.

[22:27] <pingu> yeah im sure

[22:28] <pingu> https://pastebin.com/WRV8H6XS

[22:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> By the way, fun fact: .words breaks on nbsp as well; unlike word quoting :/

[22:28] <pingu> I would also need to count the number of matches, because 1 plate is hardly a stacked plate. it must be > 1

[22:29] <pingu> I should be able to manage that tho

[22:29] <pingu> doing print(@data_ldr) prints the .dat 

[22:31] <thundergnat> Well =, according to the error you posed above, there are non-digits after the decimal point... and very suspiciously, your example file has 3024.dat in it, and nothing to separate it out.

[22:32] *** Guest8418 left
[22:33] <pingu> i think I really need: if (@data_ldr[0][3] == @data_ldr[1][3] + 8 || @data_ldr[0][3] == @data_ldr[1][3] - 8) { print("plate is stacked, as paramater 3 is a multiple of 8\n");}

[22:33] <pingu> + or - 8 

[22:33] <pingu> and for the next line

[22:34] <pingu> 8 and 8 is not stacked, they are in exactually the same position which is impossible with real LEGO but LDRAW lets you do it

[22:34] <pingu> 0 8 is fine, 8 0 is fine -8 0 is fine 0 -8 is fine

[22:34] <pingu> 1 9 is fine

[22:35] <pingu> -8 8 is not

[22:37] <thundergnat> so the absolute difference is 8? or a multiple of 8?

[22:37] <thundergnat> No, just 8

[22:39] <pingu> ok im sorted

[22:39] <pingu> 8 is the height of a lego plate

[22:40] <pingu> so per hit is must be n + 8 or n - 8 and not n == 8

[22:40] <pingu> err not n == n

[22:42] <thundergnat> m for (0, 8), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (1, 9), (-8, 8) { say "$_, ", so abs(.[0]- .[1]) == 8 }

[22:42] <thundergnat> m: for (0, 8), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (1, 9), (-8, 8) { say "$_, ", so abs(.[0]- .[1]) == 8 }

[22:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 615b9bf92: OUTPUT: ¬´0 8, True‚ê§8 0, True‚ê§-8 0, True‚ê§0 -8, True‚ê§1 9, True‚ê§-8 8, False‚ê§¬ª

[22:43] <pingu> trouble is, now im at the end of my lines so I have nothing to compare line 3 (i.e line 4) with

[22:43] <pingu> so yeah I need a hit counter and tell it if the number of hits is 

[22:43] <pingu> um

[22:45] <thundergnat> Can you .rotor through them? Or are you still trying to write C in Raku.

[22:47] <pingu> well, I will make the unrolled code into a loop soon

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> I'm doing ÔΩ¢if $! { note $!.message }ÔΩ£ and when my exception is thrown, it prints "(My message)", but what put those parentheses there? (not me)

[22:48] <thundergnat> You have the size of @data_ldr. Just don't search off the end of it

[22:49] <pingu> @data.elems

[22:49] <thundergnat> right

[22:50] <thundergnat> The fact that you are avoiding a lot of the syntactic sugar that Raku provides makes it all much more involved. And I get it, you want ot translate it to C at some point, but... 

[22:51] <thundergnat> *to (Sorry, my typing is horrible today.)

[22:52] <thundergnat> (Well... every day to be honest.)

[22:52] <pingu> its not about how many lines are in the file though

[22:52] <pingu> its about the number of hits

[22:52] <pingu> not all lines will match the if statements

[22:53] <pingu> the code is meant to find at least 2 stacked 1x1 plates in a file

[22:54] <pingu> its not just that, there is no real tutorial on the syntactic sugar 

[22:54] <pingu> theres just code snippets on raku.org

[22:54] <pingu> and that doesnt tell me how stuff is working

[22:54] <thundergnat> Then you may need to grep out the matching lines into a temporary (or anonymous) array and roror through those. 

[22:54] <thundergnat> aigh. *rotor

[22:55] <pingu> yes I could do that

[22:55] <thundergnat> What exactly tells you that it is a stack of 1x1 plates? 

[22:56] <pingu> it will end up being costly having arrays everywhere

[22:56] <thundergnat> Keep in mind that I have no idea what it is you are actually trying to do.

[22:57] <pingu> it would be a stack of 1x1 plates if the part ID is 3024.dat and if they are spaced by 8 

[22:57] <pingu> line order doesnt matter in ldcad

[22:57] <pingu> ldraw*

[22:57] <pingu> the conrdinates do

[22:58] <thundergnat> If what exactly is spaced by 8?

[22:58] <pingu> part 3024

[22:58] <pingu> cause plates are 8 LDRAW units high

[22:58] <pingu> or 3.2mm

[22:59] *** sena_kun left
[22:59] <thundergnat> What tells you the spacing? parameter 3? parameter 13?

[22:59] <pingu> the C version would handle this way better

[23:00] <pingu> rather than hardcoding stuff it would calculate the part sizes based on the sizes of the primatives

[23:00] <pingu> yeah paramater 3 is YPOS

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Lucs - Could it be an array?

[23:00] <pingu> x y and z dont mean height width length it also depends on where the camera is positioned

[23:01] <pingu> height width depth*

[23:01] <pingu> ldraw is not really meant to be used to build stuff, its an output syntax that is somewhat human readable compared to binary

[23:02] <pingu> you use a program like LDCAD to build

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Not sure what you mean. I my Exception class I have ÔΩ¢method message { "My message" }ÔΩ£

[23:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean the returned thing

[23:16] <rf> lucs can you send your code?

[23:17] *** freeside left
[23:18] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Yes and no. It's a bit deep. I can try to golf it down, and if things go as usual, that will be enough for me to figure out what's wrong, heh. I was just wondering if someone had an idea for something obvious I might have been missing.

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I've used $! like once in my life and note downright never probably

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Do you handle exceptions

[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't often get exceptions in the first place but yeah, should the building collapse, CATCH will work well

[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> (And 'note' is just like 'say', except it prints to STDERR instead.)

[23:22] <ugexe> $! isn't thread safe fwiw

[23:22] <ugexe> you can do `my $!;` before the code that potentially sets it though

[23:22] *** xinming left
[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Hmm... My program has no (obvious) concurrency.

[23:24] <ugexe> can it potentially be consumed by a different program that does use concurrency?

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> I'll try cutting the code down, to see if it still occurs.

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> ugexe: I wouldn't think so.

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how did thread safety come up in the first place?

[23:25] *** xinming joined
[23:25] <ugexe> i just brought it up like 2 minutes ago

[23:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what for?

[23:28] <ugexe> because i felt like it, damn

[23:30] *** freeside joined
[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> But it isn't related to the actual question at least, right?

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, by confidentally and persistently talking about something unrelated, one can really get the impression that it is related, after all

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Same thing, it's just it's better to know whether it is actually related in some not-so-obvious way or not
