[00:11] <pingu> sprintf is multi sub sprintf(Cool:D $format, *@args) but how do I view the function block of sprintf ?
[00:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by consulting the source of Rakudo
[00:13] <rf> pingu: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/430d6d29e4deaa818525c0ce9573d12461109fe7/src/core.e/Formatter.pm6#L849
[00:13] <pingu> cant I do it from my IDE
[00:13] <rf> You might be able to from Comma
[00:13] <pingu> cool im in comma
[00:13] <rf> Ctrl + click the function
[00:14] <rf> or Command + click if on MAc
[00:16] <pingu> 'my $line = sprintf($format, 1, 2, 3);'
[00:18] <rf> What does your format look like
[00:19] <rf> m: sprintf('%d, %d, %d', 1, 2, 3).say;
[00:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3d2f8bd9d: OUTPUT: ¬´1, 2, 3‚ê§¬ª
[00:24] *** deoac joined
[00:26] <pingu> all it says is 'my $line = sprintf($format, 1, 2, 3);'
[00:26] <pingu> wait
[00:26] <pingu> it says no usages found basically
[00:26] <pingu> it wont let me copy and paste the message, its a tooltip
[00:30] <rf> Yeah, then you'll just have to look up the sources in rakudo
[00:31] <pingu> holy crap thats a lot of code for one function (in the github)
[00:32] <pingu> C stdlib is like that too 
[00:32] <pingu> maybe I should just use sprintf rather than making my own function
[00:32] <rf> That file is the file for all formatting
[00:33] <pingu> I dont quite understand
[00:33] <rf> It's not really idiomatic Raku to use sprintf, I think its more common to just use interpolation
[00:33] <rf> m: my $a = 'world'; say "Hello $a";
[00:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3d2f8bd9d: OUTPUT: ¬´Hello world‚ê§¬ª
[00:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for what it's worth, Formatter is 6.e only and hence it's in a preview stage

[00:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> here's an implementation in 6.c
[00:34] <rf> Was unaware of that, thanks Nemo
[00:34] <pingu> well originally I did this but it wouldnt work: https://pastebin.com/pPaA0HL5
[00:35] *** jpn joined
[00:35] <rf> Seems you were trying to do printf
[00:35] <pingu> so I sort of was using interpolation
[00:35] <[Coke]> (irssi) I hate irc but also use irssi for raku related chat.
[00:36] <pingu> I used to use termux and irssi
[00:36] <pingu> on android
[00:38] <rf> Does this proto actually do anything: proto sub sprintf($, |) {*}
[00:38] <rf> Never really saw the need for protos outside of iheritance
[00:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> protos are for holding the multi dispatch together in a single entry point
[00:39] <rf> I see
[00:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this one is declaring some big dummy signature and {*} (which is a special symbol) says "just execute the winning candidate bruh"

[00:42] <rf> Oops
[00:42] <rf> I thought samewith would hit the non proto
[01:00] <pingu> ill see if I can do what I want without sprintf then
[01:01] <pingu> I assume sprintf is just merging the format string with the paramaters and then returning it as a string
[01:02] <pingu> "%f %f %f", 1.1, 2.2, 3.3); return $RetStr; # "1.1 2.2 3.3"

[07:30] <nine> proto sub sprintf($, |) {*} actually does something: it declares that _all_ multi candidates will require at least one positional argument
[07:30] <nine> Also in the setting (i.e. Rakudo core) protos do not get auto-generated, so you will find protos for all multis there.

[15:39] <pingu> difference between pop and splice?
[15:39] <pingu> they seem the same
[15:40] *** cfa joined
[15:40] <[Coke]> pop is very specific, splice is very generic.
[15:41] <[Coke]> you can do any of the array manipulation work with splice depending on args passed
[15:41] <pingu> does splice return the items that are removed
[15:41] <[Coke]> m: my @a=<a b c>; dd @a.pop; 
[15:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 886a00d1c: OUTPUT: ¬´"c"‚ê§¬ª
[15:42] <[Coke]> m: my @a=<a b c>; dd @a.splice(0,2,<d>); dd @a;
[15:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 886a00d1c: OUTPUT: ¬´Array @a = ["a", "b"]‚ê§Array @a = ["d", "c"]‚ê§¬ª
[15:43] <pingu> cant you just do pop with a range
[15:43] <[Coke]> ^^ yes, it returns the removed ones. Docs cover this as well.
[15:43] <[Coke]> no. pop doesn't take args.
[15:44] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <a b c>; dd @a.tail(2); dd @a;
[15:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 886a00d1c: OUTPUT: ¬´("b", "c").Seq‚ê§Array @a = ["a", "b", "c"]‚ê§¬ª
[15:44] <[Coke]> tail lets you specify a count, but doesn't do the pop.
[15:46] <pingu> m: my@format = <a b c>; @format[0..1] = pop();
[15:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 886a00d1c: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Calling pop() will never work with signature of the proto ($, *%)‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> my@format = <a b c>; @format[0..1] = ‚èèpop();‚ê§¬ª

[15:47] <cfa> it sounds like you want this:
[15:47] <cfa> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my @removed = @a.splice(2, 2); say @a; say @removed;

[15:47] <pingu> ok yeah thx
[15:47] <cfa> (remove 2 elements starting at index 2)
[15:48] <pingu> is there a way to delete everything in the array in one go
[15:49] <pingu> maybe @a = (Empty);
[15:49] <pingu> I still want 14 elements but they should all be set to Nil
[15:50] <pingu> otherwise my loop () would be out of range
[15:50] *** AlexDaniel joined
[15:51] <pingu> if two tokens get misaligned I made a condition to just wipe the array and do the loop again
[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so do you mean the length should be preserved or not?
[15:54] <pingu> yeah
[15:54] <pingu> preserve the length
[15:54] <pingu> hmm this dont work if (@format[0..1] == $spec[3..12] || @format[0..1] == $spec[13])

[15:55] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: coke self-assigned Some targets in the Makefile do not work any more https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3035
[15:56] <pingu> im a bit mad that I had to do $1.0f too rather than just letting the presion be inherited by the data itself
[15:56] <pingu> $line will eventually contain tokens with decimal places
[15:59] <pingu> so yeah padded 0 's on the left or right should all be treat as just being printed as an int 
[15:59] <pingu> because they dont change the value, non zeros however would change the value and therefore matter
[16:03] <pingu> ah wait it should be line not spec but the problem will still exist
[16:03] <pingu> i think it doesnt like the ranges 
[16:03] <pingu> being used in that way
[16:05] <pingu> actually idk what im doing anymore
[16:05] <pingu> because that is comparing the integers and they might be the same anyhow 
[16:06] <pingu> lets say I had 2 lines with slightly different data
[16:06] <pingu> they would now therefore be treat as misalighned

[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> me neither, good sir
[16:09] <pingu> I guess it isnt comparing 2 lines, its comparing a constant string called line to an array, as long as I dont compare $line1 and $line2 or @format1 with @format2 it should be fine
[16:10] <cfa> [Coke]: with those removed, https://github.com/Raku/doc#building-the-html-documentation is very out of date 
[16:10] <cfa> presumably mention of building with `documentable start -a -v --highlight`, updating with `documentable update --highlight` is still worthwhile
[16:11] <pingu> so I might as well just do: if(@Format ne $spec) { @format = (Empty); } 
[16:11] <cfa> (or is the changeover to the new site imminent?)
[16:11] <pingu> err @format ne $line
[16:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know what imminent means
[16:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but if that's what you mean: the next time we'll be deploying, it will be the new site
[16:12] <cfa> neat
[16:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and documentable basically enters the legacy state; not much needed for that because it's essentially broken already from what I know
[16:13] <cfa> i guess i'll have to look into how to build the new doc site locally
[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's really simple tbh
[16:13] <cfa> which repo is it?

[16:14] <El_Che> (there all my years of Latin finally useful after a few decades!)
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you clone the repo, make sure cro is installed in a way that suits you, and run bin_files/build_site
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> El_Che: I learned Latin for 5 years myself but it wouldn't help for the life of me
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it has always been more a fun grammar exercize

[16:24] <tellable6> 2023-02-02T19:48:29Z #raku <rf> melezhik I figured it out. Very small bug causing all of the failures I pushed a new version of Distribution::Builder::Cmake 0.0.6 which solves this.

[16:25] <pingu> idk why it cant just do  if (@format ne $line) { } but oh well
[16:26] <melezhik> rf: good to see distribution builder cmake bug is fuxedc
[16:26] <melezhik> fixed
[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ngl this is not only for the Raku conference but I think it really feels that we have very different senses for prices
[16:26] <pingu> probably because they are not just single strings
[16:26] <pingu> they are lists or sequences of strings
[16:28] <pingu> in C theres less stuff like scalar array list sequence hash bag mix graph set etc
[16:28] <pingu> you just use const array for a list and array for a set
[16:29] <pingu> err array for an array
[16:29] <pingu> if you want a set you have to make code that checks for duplicates, C supports the range operator now but before that you had to write code for that too
[16:30] *** melezhik left
[16:30] <pingu> hashes would probably be enums or arrays + pointers
[16:30] <pingu> mixes would be structs or arrays with typecasts
[16:31] <pingu> I assume a mix is a homogenous type array
[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > idk why it cant just do  if (@format ne $line) { } but oh well what would that do in your opinion?
[16:32] <pingu> I was thinking they were both just one string but I was wrong
[16:32] <pingu> it would probably default to @format[0] and $line[0]
[16:32] <pingu> if you removed the [0]['s
[16:33] *** melezhik joined
[16:33] <pingu> so since its a list of strings I just did @format[$token] ne $line[$token] instead
[16:34] <pingu> btw is @_ special or is it just the same as making another reference
[16:34] <pingu> or $_
[16:34] <pingu> i think thats for perl 5 backwards compat right
[16:36] *** melezhik left
[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> $_ is "special", @_ not really
[16:37] <pingu> how so
[16:37] <pingu> other than the fact that you dont need to declare it
[16:41] <cfa> pingu: https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#index-entry-@__
[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well $_ is set by many operations
[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and like @_, it can also stand for an auto-argument in a block/sub
[16:47] <bartolin> Oh, that sadness when reading that Kaiepi has passed away. I'll miss him.
[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also a prolific contributor to the JVM backend...
[16:57] <bartolin> yeah. I have a couple of old emails and open tabs with stuff that I wanted to discuss with him. Most related to BSD support or the JVM backend. He did many great things there (and elsewhere).

[19:07] <[Coke]> seen on the internet, any reason not to add Complex.sign?
[19:07] <[Coke]> https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/10sm0sm/why_isnt_sign_defined_for_complex_numbers/
[19:09] <[Coke]> ... (though if Complex.abs is defined as distance, how would sign ever be -1?)
[19:11] <pingu>  /j #c
[19:14] <cfa> hrm, i'm hitting 'raku is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way', i.e. https://github.com/jnthn/p6-io-socket-async-ssl/issues/69
[19:19] <[Coke]> (oh, because Complex.sign returns a Complex, not like Real.sign...)
[19:22] * cfa rebuilds OpenSSL, links to MacPorts' libraries
[19:23] <cfa> now to retry  bin_files/build-site 
[19:24] <cfa> oops, i linked to the wrong github issue but n/m
[19:25] <pingu> ok this is what I need but as raku: if(value == (int)value) { fmt = PREFIX "%d" } else { fmt = PREFIX "%3.3f" }; snprintf(dest, SPACE, fmt, ..., value);
[19:27] * [Coke] tries a build adding Complex.sign to v6.e ...
[19:28] <cfa> pingu: are you just trying to specify different format paramters depending on type?
[19:28] <pingu> sort of yes
[19:29] <pingu> ldraw wouldnt mind if I read 1 but printed it to a new file as 1.0
[19:29] <pingu> but then if the tokens get misaligned , my function to check for the token misalignment is circumvented
[19:30] <pingu> because hey you can just treat all tokens as either int or float which ldraw doesnt like
[19:30] <pingu> tokens 0 and 1 must be int, 3 to 13 can be int or float
[19:34] <pingu> https://pastebin.com/1aWtiS0Z
[19:35] <[Coke]> if I add Complex to src/6.e, augment it, add a sign method, use v6.e.PREVIEW, it still complains about trying to convert to a Real (which the Cool helper does). am I missing something in the 6.e setup to make it available or just the existence of the file enough?
[19:35] <cfa> m: say +$_ ~~ Int ?? "%d" !! "%3.3f" for <-1.5 -1 0 1 1.5>
[19:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar c88f50d5e: OUTPUT: ¬´%3.3f‚ê§%d‚ê§%d‚ê§%d‚ê§%3.3f‚ê§¬ª
[19:35] <cfa> pingu: ^
[19:36] <cfa> so for example:
[19:36] <cfa> m: my $x = '1.5'; $x.fmt(+$x ~~ Int ?? "%d" !! "%3.3f")
[19:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar c88f50d5e: ( no output )
[19:36] <cfa> m: my $x = '1.5'; $x.fmt(+$x ~~ Int ?? "%d" !! "%3.3f").say
[19:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar c88f50d5e: OUTPUT: ¬´1.500‚ê§¬ª
[19:36] <cfa> vs.
[19:36] <[Coke]> ah, core_sources.
[19:36] <cfa> m: my $x = '1'; $x.fmt(+$x ~~ Int ?? "%d" !! "%3.3f").say
[19:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar c88f50d5e: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§¬ª
[19:36] <cfa> there are other ways ofc
[19:36] <pingu> thx ill try it
[19:37] <cfa> here we just cast the string to a numeric; if we get an integer, use "%d", otherwise "%3.3f"
[19:37] <cfa> (if you pass in a non-numeric string this will fail)
[19:38] <pingu> cool
[19:40] <cfa> you had SPACE in your example; you could just prepend that to your format string
[19:41] <pingu> but what about the string on the end
[19:41] <pingu> 3024.dat
[19:41] * [Coke] can't remember the last time he submitted code for rakudo and not some admin/docs stuff.
[19:41] <pingu> and yes I'd like to put it inside of sprintf
[19:42] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5181
[19:42] <cfa> [Coke]: nice one
[19:42] <cfa> pingu: you didn't mention that -- what're you trying to do?
[19:42] <cfa> output 1.5.dat ?
[19:43] <cfa> er, 1.500.dat
[19:43] <pingu> I made everything in line a string before but i got an error saying I cant modify it
[19:43] <pingu> i only got that error if I made 1 0 0 into 1.1 0 0
[19:43] <cfa> sorry, i'm not following
[19:43] <pingu> 1.0 0 0 would work and print 1 0 0 weirdly
[19:44] <pingu> in my pastebin
[19:45] <pingu> and before that I made format an array but I got: positional passed instead of "str" or something
[19:46] <cfa> i don't have time to look at the paste right now but it might help if you just restate what you're trying to achieve and exactly where you're getting stuck
[19:46] <cfa> i'll try and check back later
[19:46] <pingu> so, I want to tokenize this file format: https://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html
[19:48] *** Guest2085 joined
[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I hit pheix up and actually turned kind of optimistic regarding "port to Raku" kind of projects
[19:55] <pingu>  my $x = '1.0'; $x.fmt(+$x ~~ Int ?? "%d" !! "%1.1f").say would either lose precision, or it would add too many trailing 0 's
[19:55] <pingu> unless you got lucky and it matched the precision of the input
[19:55] <pingu> by add too many zeros I mean just setting it to something big enough for everything like 8.8f
[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so... some of you may know the modules.raku.org site has been in a kind of abandoned state for a long time, partially because it's a Mojolicious web app and members don't really have interest in maintaining an old site written in Perl
[19:57] *** snonux left
[19:57] *** snonux_ is now known as snonux
[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't want to give up on it, however I know virtually no Perl, so the rework plan is destined to always fall behind other, more approachable Raku tasks
[19:58] *** rantanplan joined
[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my question is, are there people around with good enough Perl knowledge who would be willing to help out with this?
[19:59] <pingu> isnt lizmat the per5 to raku expert
[19:59] <pingu> perl*
[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> either she is or she isn't, I don't know these days, but frankly lizmat is overburdened with actually more important tasks
[20:00] <pingu> oh
[20:00] <pingu> yeah I would probably imagine so
[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> while in current days a modern and approachable modules.raku.org feels more like a "nice to have" than a crippling necessity, we can get along with raku.land and only sometimes checking the module site as it is now
[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my particular hope would be, is that we have some momentum with web stuff again, we don't need to immediately reach out to Cro stuff, the choices are more granular
[20:02] <jdv> wow it got cold out fast
[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> pheix also made a router and worked on templating solutions, rf also made a remarkable intro with Humming-Bird
[20:03] <jdv> [Coke]: how is it up there?
[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perhaps I could also mention jjatria but it feels weird because of his involvement in raku.land itself
[20:04] <jdv> Nemokosch:  i think your "push to map" may be the biggest release blocker but i havent confirmed it yet
[20:04] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch
[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> could you please elaborate?
[20:05] <jdv> i cant at the moment.  the ladt blin run had many failures pointing at that change.
[20:05] <jdv> probably monday i can show you
[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be good to know what blin does
[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you know, that particular change is, for all intents and purposes, a regression fix
[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the regression happens to be fairly old, early 2016
[20:08] <jdv> its on github:)
[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what do "failures" mean, though
[20:08] <jdv> doesnt mean a bunch of ecosystem depends on something related...
[20:09] <jdv> the tests failed
[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, what tests?
[20:10] <jdv> the respective dist
[20:10] <jdv> blin isnt too fancy.  it just tries to smoke the eco.
[20:12] <jdv> iirc, im out and about at the moment, the common snippet is something about "cant find push to map in map"
[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, once there are published results, I'll definitely take a look
[20:12] <jdv> thanks
[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "cant find push to map in map" - hmm, this one kind of makes you think. I wouldn't know by heart on what type this dispatching was introduced but iirc it was on Hash only
[20:14] <jdv> i know:)
[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yep, hash only
[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is not clear is 1. why would it be needed for non-Hashes, including a plain Map 2. if it is needed for some legitimate reason, why did the tests and spectests all pass
[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so yeah for that it would be probably good to see the dists in question
[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it could always happen (unfortunately) that there was a blind spot in the tests
[20:17] <jdv> thats why blin exists, basically;)
[20:18] <jdv> i normally curate the results but i xant til monday.  i can share the raw results sooner though if desired.
[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> back in the days when this corner case I was trying to fix was still working, Map and Hash weren't separated into two files, this behavior was all defined on Maps
[20:20] <jdv> just want to avoid goose chases and such
[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh I might take another look at the code right now, I can really imagine that a call tries to redispatch after some looser check, so for example making sure the argument is a Map, and then calling this method; even though it really should only be called on Hashes (or should be defined for Maps)
[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no guarantee I will find anything but it made me curious honestly
[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> like looking at something like (nqp::istype($x,Map) && nqp::not_i(nqp::iscont($x))),               $x.PUSH_FROM_MAP($temp),
[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> suspicious that this won't be enough, not if PUSH_FROM_MAP is defined on a Hash
[20:26] <jdv> ill post the raw results (take with grains of salt) in a bit
[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh no need, I could reproduce the failure in a simple snippet
[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my %sad is Map = :foo; (%sad,).hash # No such method 'PUSH_FROM_MAP' for invocant of type 'Map'
[20:29] <jdv> looks familiar
[20:29] <jdv> sorry and thanks
[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Probably everything breaks where a list of Maps is assigned, or forced into hash context...
[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you know what is the absolute irony?
[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Map.STORE probably did the right thing to store "object hashes", only Hash.STORE didn't...
[20:36] <jdv> complex things be surprising?
[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and now it turned backwards xD
[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Hash can store Hashes well, but not Maps...
[20:43] <jdv> no rush btw.  the next release attempt will be 2/17.
[20:44] <jdv> in case anyone missed it todays release is not happening:)
[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Still, I think for now it might be better to fix it rather simple (e.g add a candidate onto Map that just redirects to STORE_MAP there), and later on I'd rather make a bigger redesign so that the logic is not duplicated all around
[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> then it can be more thoroughly planned, benchmarked, whatever goes
[20:48] *** Guest2085 left
[20:48] <jdv> im but the lowly release janitor:)  that sort of duscussion is probably better had with betters like liz or nine or vurg, etc...
[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> sorry, it's partially also just thinking out loud üòõ
[20:48] <jdv> im just the messenger of sorts
[20:49] <jdv> ha
[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> - e.g I'd rather get rid of handwritten nqp:: typechecks all dumped into sole methods, in favor of dispatching to methods doing one thing at a time. I don't know the costs of a method dispatch but I'd hope it's not tremendously more than the nqp check, like, say, 3 nqp ops instead of one, idk

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well I'm not against raku.land whatsoever but to be honest, I wouldn't be happy if it actually drained the people who could help resurrecting modules.raku.org so there's that
[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's just not the same thing, both by design and position within the Raku macroverse

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's up this time, pingu?
[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also, I expect the "resurrecting modules.raku.org" a one-time investment, this is an important point
[22:01] <pingu> I just want to check if $toknum is 0 or 1 and that $tok is an integer
[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> once it's a reasonable, accessible Raku project in its heart, it could have a position as any public Raku projects
[22:01] <guifa> $foo %% 1 <-- integer check
[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or $foo.narrow ~~ Int
[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> iirc
[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> frankly, part of the reason I'm hoping for people like pheix or rf to help out is because they have worked with/on non-Cro web projects in Raku, and this could give them a legitimate motive

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> newsflash: didn't work
[22:17] <guifa> haha
[22:17] <guifa> I had to write some JS today at work and it was painful
[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh I mostly like JS but not nearly as much as Raku
[22:18] <guifa> It was also painful because I was having to write it inside of Acrobat 
[22:18] <guifa> lol
[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'd say JS does kinda feel like Raku, except many things Raku tries to solve the best are just unaddressed, "do whatever you want to achieve this" style
[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The only aspect where my heart cries out for the JS way that I can quickly think of is the concept of methods
[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> as in, they don't exist and I think that's really the clearest solution, by a mile
[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> regarding this I wish there had been a hacker around Perl 6 in 2005 whose favorite language had been JS üòÇ
