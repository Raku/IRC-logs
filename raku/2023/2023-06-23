[14:42] <Xliff_> lizmat: Remember the question I asked you yesterday and you said $*CU was the only way to get to the AST tree?

[14:43] <lizmat> yes

[14:44] <Xliff_> How about this: Create a role with two methods: .ast and .set-ast. Once an .set-ast is used, it cannot be used again. At compile time, once an object has been rendered into an ast, do the following: $obj does RakuAST::Object; $obj.set_ast($ast) 

[14:44] <Xliff_> This now gives us a more targetted way in and is only available at BEGIN and CHECK.

[17:44] <grondilu> Hello all.

[17:45] <grondilu> Do you guys keep up with the recent AI craze?  I've heard that some LLM are getting pretty good at generating code and I wonder if they could be used for raku.

[17:46] <grondilu> Most notably, I hear that some models now have context windows of ten of thousands of words, so I wonder if it'd be possible to put all raku documentation into a single file and feed it to a LLM. 

[17:48] <grondilu> I could be throwing a pie in the sky here, I'll admitp

[18:14] <jdv> from what ive read they are not good, their ok

[18:14] <jdv> surprisingly ok but not great

[18:34] <Xliff_> grondilu: I've tried both Bard and ChatGPT. They have varying results based on the language used. Many of them use models that will confuse Raku and Perl together, probably because of the Raku/Perl6 link.

[18:34] <Xliff_> So if you ask either one to write Raku code, it will be a mix of Raku and Perl.

[18:35] <Xliff_> I wonder if this simple rule would help it...

[18:35] <Xliff_> "If page matches the regular expression "\$\w+\-\>" then it is to be used as a reference"

[18:36] <Xliff_> lizmat: Did you read my question from this morning?

[21:04] <jast> I think people just read way too much into the (admittedly impressive) recent progress made with large language models

[21:04] <jast> specifically people tend to think that large language models "think", which honestly would be an awful stretch of the word

[21:06] <jast> but even though the GPTs are impressive at what they do, many of the important problems in AI progress are as unsolved as ever

[22:44] <Voldenet> grondilu: I've tried some tasks, in general gpt3.5 was good at generating things that didn't even compile, but for instance using linux apis is a lot faster with gpt3.5 even with some broken code to fix
