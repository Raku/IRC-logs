[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That image of a cat and a butterfly reminded me that a few days ago @nemokosch was mean to me too. I labored so much on a certain DALLE3 painting of raccoons and pears in a Rube Goldberg machine, and then on another painting with wolfs and rams, and when I shared them with him, he told me that they look the same!!! I was going to complain publicly about it -- like I am doing now -- but I started reading certain

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> speculations about happenings in Middle East, so, I kind of forgot...

[08:39] <thebb> so I'm doing the exercism raku track and running prove6 gives all tests successful, but it complains about non-zero exist status, "Parse errors: No plan found in TAP output"

[08:40] <thebb> doing a search with that error refers to some perl5 issue apparently

[08:41] <thebb> it's ok otherwise but exercism will not let you pass that exercise because of that error

[11:04] <grondilu> so the space matters, well I guess it does inside a rule but it's not intuitive

[11:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's like the main property of a rule

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> tbh rule feels like an unfeature

[11:58] <tbrowder__> .ask ugexe can zef reliably copy a zef store's contents to another store? my use case is upgrading a binary download of rakudo and using the store of the previous version.

[11:58] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[12:02] <ugexe> why would you need to copy it?

[12:04] *** teatwo left
[12:04] <ugexe> like why not just let zef use the same default store regardless of rakudo version

[12:04] *** teatwo joined
[12:05] <tbrowder__> the upgrade would be in a different location and have its own store (unless its ok to copy the upgaded binary over the previous one).

[12:05] *** teatwo left
[12:05] <ugexe> zef store is ~/.zef/store

[12:05] *** teatwo joined
[12:05] <ugexe> when you upgrade rakudo that path doesn't change

[12:06] <ugexe> when you upgrade zef that path doesn't change

[12:07] <ugexe> when you install a different version of raku it doesn't change

[12:07] <ugexe> so i all of the above scenarios zef is going to use the same store

[12:07] <ugexe> thus i'm not sure why you'd want to copy the store anywhere for reuse purposes

[12:07] <ugexe> it is already reused

[14:57] <[Coke]> in review, but Raku uses the same TAP, so a plan is also required to complete without warning.

[14:57] <ugexe> those paths are Raku, not zef

[14:58] <ugexe> anything in site/bin is going to rely on all the other files in site/

[14:58] <ugexe> including the rakudo-version-specific precompilation files

[15:09] <ab5tract_> [Coke] What’s in review about TAP?

[15:28] <tbrowder__> so, after upgrading raku, all the modules there would have to be reinstalled with the new raku

[15:29] <tbrowder__> but

[15:31] <tbrowder__> hm, given the case of my user-installed modules, do they automatically get recompiled after a raku upgrade?

[15:31] <tbrowder__> at first use after the raku upgrade?

[15:58] <[Coke]> https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2023-10-20.html#08:39

[16:01] <ugexe> could also use done-testing() if you dont want a plan

[16:13] <[Coke]> +1

[16:13] <[Coke]> The main issue with done-testing is that then you don't know if some tests weren't run for some reason.

[16:28] <ab5tract_> Still not sure what’s under review about it :)
