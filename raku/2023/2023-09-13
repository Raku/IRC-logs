[00:07] <tbrowder__> hi, how do i use $*ERR to redirect stderr to /dev/null inside my raku program?
[01:17] <ugexe> m: $*ERR = class { method print(|) { }; }; die 42;
[01:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 636c87894: ( no output )
[01:20] <tbrowder__> thnx.
[01:20] <tbrowder__> trying now...
[01:22] <tbrowder__> whoa, i still need $*OUT to work as usual
[01:22] <tbrowder__> oh, i think i see...trying now
[01:33] <tbrowder__> works as advertised, thanks, Nick!
[01:33] <tbrowder__> another example needed in the docs

[08:24] <Ambrose> slight problem with this page: https://rakudo.org/star/macos if anyone's interested

[08:24] *** mfiano joined
[08:26] <mfiano> Hi again. I was here a year or so ago, but I got distracted with a work programming project to get to know Camelia better.
[08:26] <mfiano> preventing me from getting to, rather.
[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well, what is the problem?
[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> And welcome back ^^
[08:35] *** Manifest0 left
[08:37] <Ambrose> Hi, it says there's an application that I can drag to my Applications folder, but there isn't
[08:37] <mfiano> Thanks. No problem, just saying hi.
[08:38] <Ambrose> There's
[08:38] <Ambrose> bin
[08:38] <Ambrose> include
[08:38] <Ambrose> lib
[08:38] <Ambrose> share
[08:38] <Ambrose> I mean, I've installed Raku the other way by now but clearly somethings going on with that install documentation
[08:39] <mfiano> I'm new here, but that looks like a standard FHS filesystem layout. Did you look in bin where binaries are usually located?
[08:39] <Ambrose> I got there from here: https://rakudo.org/star
[08:40] <Ambrose> Then clicked "installation instructions"
[08:41] <Ambrose> "that looks like a standard FHS filesystem layout. Did you look in bin where binaries are usually located" yeah there's stuff in `bin` but that's not the point I'm making.
[08:41] <Ambrose> The point I'm making is, the instructions says I should open it up and find an application
[08:42] <mfiano> applications are binaries. binaries are always found in a specific directory on Unix-likes, which MacOS is.
[08:42] <mfiano> This is assuming you know about Mac
[08:42] <mfiano> Just enter bin, and copy the application from there
[08:42] <Ambrose> A can of coke and a bottle of coke are both OK but if your instructions tell me to open the can with the ring pull then I will be puzzled if you've given me a bottle
[08:43] <Ambrose> Once again, nothing wrong with the _contents of that file_
[08:43] <Ambrose> I'm saying the instructions don't match the content
[08:43] <mfiano> You can find an application if you open it up. Which part is confusing?
[08:44] <Ambrose> OK here are the instructions: ‚ÄúDrag-and-drop the application from that window into /Applications"
[08:45] <Ambrose> If you follow the instructions up to *drag and drop the application* and there's no application, then the instructions are wrong or confusing
[08:45] <Ambrose> There was probably a different version before, I don't know
[08:50] *** Manifest0 joined
[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> As you might have noticed, there hasn't been a Rakudo Star release for Mac for more than three years
[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Maybe this used to work in a different time. Hell, even Macs have changed since early 2020
[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Maybe it would make sense to add something like "this used to exist, help needed to revive it"
[08:57] <Ambrose> Yeah anyone who bought a new mac recently is probably swearing like a trooper over everything to do with architectures for a start
[08:57] <Ambrose> Apple now makes their own chips, yay good for them except a lot of stuff won't compile
[09:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah... I don't think Rakudo has a cross-compilation toolchain (I don't know if Mac's installers have, even)
[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and the people who create the Rakudo Star releases probably simply don't have a Mac, or a Mac person around to assemble the things
[09:06] <Ambrose> Just for the record I have successfully got Raku running before I even got on this chat:
[09:06] <Ambrose> `Welcome to Rakudo‚Ñ¢ v2023.06.
[09:06] <Ambrose> Implementing the Raku¬Æ Programming Language v6.d.
[09:06] <Ambrose> Built on MoarVM version 2023.06.`
[09:06] <Ambrose> I assume I'm relatively up to date
[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, it should be compilable, there are people who use it
[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> just not with the Rakudo Star bundle
[09:07] *** jpn left
[09:07] <Ambrose> I installed it via macports which went just fine
[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think rakubrew itself should work for recent Mac as well
[09:08] *** jpn joined
[09:11] <Ambrose> I'm just showing my kid how I can type œÄ in raku and it knows it's Pi
[09:11] <Ambrose> Also e and i
[09:13] *** jpn left
[09:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> perhaps there is tau as well
[09:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I kinda don't like how i is not a valid Complex literal in itself, you'd have to write 1i to parse it
[09:21] <Ambrose> Yeah œÑ worked
[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, technically, there are no Complex literals, just like how there are no negative literals; it's rather like there are parseable expressions
[09:28] *** jpn joined
[09:34] <Ambrose> I don't know enough about maths to understand the argument, just thought my kid who IS good at maths would be interested
[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> fair enough
[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> they are like ingrained constants
[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, constants are usually similarly ingrained; they are resolved at compile time and then a term is created for them in the grammar itself

[11:25] <thundergnat> Regarding the discussion yesterday about a named parameter for "split". I would be in favor of: "pieces"
[11:25] <thundergnat> m: multi split(Str $str, Str $needle, :$pieces = Inf) { $str.split($needle, $pieces) }; say 'a:b:c:d:e'.&split(':', :3pieces);
[11:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 636c87894: OUTPUT: ¬´(a b c:d:e)‚ê§¬ª
[11:25] <lizmat> well, then it would be ":3max-pieces"  ?
[11:26] <lizmat> because you specify the maximum number of pieces, you can't guarantee the actual number of pieces?
[11:26] <lizmat> but I like "pieces" as a concept
[11:27] <thundergnat> Hmm. max-pieces would be more accurate but may be unnecessarily verbose. Just a thought.

[15:54] <Xliff> \
[15:54] <tellable6> 2023-09-11T19:36:04Z #raku <gfldex> Xliff I did spend some thinking time on your reusability question. You don't even need a macro. An EVAL in a BEGIN inside a module won't get a performance hit, thanks to precomp.
[15:54] <Xliff> \o
[15:56] <Xliff> .tell gfldex True, that would be nice for RakuAST, but how would you deploy it in code?
[15:56] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to gfldex
[15:57] <gfldex> I guess there is always more room for another post on my blog. :)
[15:59] <Xliff> Aha! That is true! Looking forward to it!
[16:00] <Xliff> In the meantime, I have been experiencing an issue with raku where I will run one of my projects and get a "no space left on drive"
[16:00] <Xliff> This is with the editor "pulsar" (nee atom) running.
[16:00] <Xliff> If I close pulsar, the program runs fine.
[16:01] <Xliff> Is it possible that pulsar is changing the environment in such a way that a drive space check is reporting no space when there actually is?
[16:02] <MasterDuke> ulimit problem?
[16:02] <Xliff> If it was a ulimit problem then why would anything work? Why does shutting down pulsar fix the issue?
[16:12] *** jpn left
[16:17] <gfldex> Xliff: Pulsar could use cgroups to limit itself.
[16:20] <Xliff> How would I do that?
[16:21] <Xliff> Or do you think that its use of cgroups is the cause?
[16:21] <Xliff> Funny you mention that. I just ran into the problem, again.
[16:21] <Xliff> Close pulsar.... problem goes away.
[16:22] <gfldex> What happens if pulsar is open and you run the Raku progam from a different terminal?
[16:24] <Xliff> Different terminal. Same problem.

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> lately I've been trying to get some code polished for ppm
[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but all in all, I'm very thankful I don't have to actually use this editor
[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and it's mostly the fault of Atom as an organization, they did a far worse job than any hobbyist volunteer group
[16:59] *** jgaz left
[17:09] <coleman> I recently became aware of "Invisible XML", a grammer language that reminds me (a little bit) of Raku grammars https://invisiblexml.org/
[17:10] <coleman> The idea is you write a grammar to parse random text formats into xml.
