[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: Removing one of the Fcntl repos

[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: 

[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: Perhaps both would be good to go.

[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: This one was a fork of fork of the other one, more lagging behind than the original one.

[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: The original one is released both here and on CPAN.

[05:57] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem/main: The only known module that might have depended on this (Shell::DSL) didn't have the metadata pinned so even that was already retrieving the other one.

[19:14] <jdv> huh

[19:19] <[Coke]> Yes, well I have been here for like 20 years. ;)

[19:19] <[Coke]> or, I guess in the #raku channel, since the beginning.

[19:20] *** buildable6 left
[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Old as

[19:21] <jdv> was #perl6 the first one?  where tang and little and all them hung out?

[19:22] *** buildable6 joined
[19:22] <[Coke]> i mean, I go back to parrot.

[19:23] <jdv> so do i but wasnt the perl6 can first?  im nkt sure though.

[19:23] <[Coke]> I honestly don't remember.

[19:24] <[Coke]> I am sure I wasn't on #perl6 from the beginning, though

[19:24] <jdv> i remember smolder runs on various thing targetting parrot.  those were the days...

[19:24] <jdv> *things

[19:24] <jdv> and leo and dan not getting along

[19:25] <jdv> good times

[19:29] <jdv> at the time it seemed sane but looking back now i more of the idea of "if you think perl6/raku is overly ambitious wait til you hear about parrot!":)

[20:11] <[Coke]> https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake/issues/48 - librarymake is borked, taking out two of the readline alternative for the REPL

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah, yesterday I made a workflow for a dist and that also couldn't be installed on Mac to begin with

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder why was the CI for Mac removed anyway, it should work, right?

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what's the highest version that can be installed?

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://raku.land/github:labster/File::Directory::Tree this dist is problematic

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> quite a number of dependencies, completely abandoned, not even a version

[22:05] <Voldenet> not to mention that it's not very optimal

[22:06] <Voldenet> mktree at least

[22:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would say PR's are welcome but right now it's a zombie module mostly

[22:09] <Voldenet> the most efficient way is to simply create the dir and upon failure use binary search until finding the directory in that chain that exists

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm gonna open an issue for it at least
