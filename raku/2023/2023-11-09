[12:02] <Xliff> What's the best way to create an anonymous sub that will take any number of arguments.

[12:02] <lizmat> sub (|c) { }

[12:02] <Xliff> "sub ( *@a ) { ... }" -- seems too large. Is there something shorter?

[12:02] <lizmat> if you only want positionals, then the slurpy is the best way

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and actually you might be better off using **@a...

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think *@a should be "soft deprecated" at this point, disadvised at least. Usually that's not what you'd want

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i use *@a all the time - in most cases it does exactly what I want

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (although I just discovered the +@a version so maybe that is better)

[12:11] <lizmat> librasteve would **@a also do what you want ?

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no

[12:11] <lizmat> or +@a for that matter

[12:11] <dakkar> oh, TIL, `*@x` has perl5-style "flatten everything" behaviour

[12:11] <lizmat> ack

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> +@a is a maybe for me

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, perl5-style "flatten everything" behavior, exactly

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I respect that raku is "keen" to maintain nested structure, but in my meats and potatoes style I usually want to sledgehammer everything flat

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, do you mind if I say

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is no slim chance you are rather the exception than the rule?

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well me and everyone who has read Think Raku (11.3 and A.7.1)

[12:19] <lizmat> nemokosch  *I* mind: how can you know what is the exception and what is the rule in this context

[12:19] <lizmat> do you have statistics?

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you mean to say that you disagree, say that

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have yet to read a proper documentation of the pros and cons of maintaining the nested structures ... I think that with a bunch of nice examples (maybe passing yaml or json around) would be a nice addition

[12:20] <lizmat> no, I'm *not* saying that: I'm saying that you should prove your statements, especially if they are directed at a person

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm fine with asking people around

[12:21] <lizmat> so far I'm just seeing an opinion, rather than a statement of fact

[12:21] <lizmat> "asking people around" is not statistics

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is usually a false dichotomy

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it is an opinion with a basis

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not all "opinions" are equal

[12:21] *** jpn joined
[12:22] <lizmat> I get the impression that your opinion is more equal than others ?

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ

[12:22] <lizmat> librasteve so true

[12:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I get the impression that I tend to put more effort into my "opinion"

[12:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> while some others just tend to say "okay, it's just an opinion" and call it a day

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't find this constructive

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nss

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if we can agree that something has a right answer, let's make some effort to get to know it and see who is right, if anybody

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but let's not just throw it all into the "opinion bin"

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I think we all agree that in the set of *@a, **@a and +@a (and |c) there is a way to do this for everyone (even if you like your way and I like mine)

[12:26] <lizmat> agree

[12:26] *** jpn left
[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> we all agree about that but I still think that *@a doesn't do what most people naively assume at the very least, and therefore it shouldn't be introduced first

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> "interestingly" the python for anon slurpy sub is: lambda *args: args

[12:29] *** jpn joined
[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> more objectively: it doesn't do what Xliff asked for, in this particular case, assuming any other context than oldschool Perl

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and does it flatten? no

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sadly not, one of the many reason I prefer raku

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it doesn't auto-flatting the individual entries in any other language I know of, with the notorious counter-example of the language that was meant to be fixed

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> auto-flatten*

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and I don't think it requires a bad mindset to think that the behavior of *@a is really just a remnant of the pre-GLR times

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so sure, statistics I don't have, but please, let's not act as if I was just making something random up, or talking from gut feelings

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> we can go through individual programming languages and check their behavior, we can go through code bases and see the common use cases etc

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or we can put our effort into something constructive

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> do you not think it is constructive to suggest something that helps people learning the language?

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes I think it is easy to learn that there are three (or 4) variants of slurpy - and yes you have to learn it (it maybe that this is a throwback to perl5 ... one of the popularest languages of all time back in the day, but it is surely nto a viable request to swap *@a and **@a

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> )

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nto => not

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I didn't suggest to swap them because I felt that would be way too sensitive anyway

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> just to turn the representation of them around, so to speak

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> like here, in this particular case: What's the best way to create an anonymous sub that will take any number of arguments was the question

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> without making further assumptions, **@a is a better answer

[13:10] <ugexe> you probably would have done better to use the word assumption or presumption earlier fwiw

[14:00] <ugexe> well, i have an entire buffer of text with an argument over a matter of factly statement that was later admittedly an opinion with an informed basis

[14:01] <ugexe> it seems that entire argument would not exist if the original statement made it clear it was presuming

[14:13] *** andinus joined
[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well, i don't think it's particularly useful to make "no further assumptions" out to be an assumption

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Or something that can be actually argued for "just an opinion", and I think that was all the "argument"

[14:44] <ugexe> I mean you are welcome to ignore my advice, but I get the impression your message is often lost in hubris when I suspect it would often be received more openly if it was communicated in a way that assumed good faith of everyone involved

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> In the meantime, I don't really get what could have been done better. I started off with "I think" and made a statement based on statistical observation and precision about the given question

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then somebody says that they like it otherwise, and it ends up turned into just "two opinions"

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's not rhetoric, I really cannot see why this is good. One could just say "stay out of it" by the same chance

[14:49] <ugexe> I guess if you think your communication style is proving fruitful then indeed there is nothing you could have done better

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Seeing the sacrifices this community has already taken, I don't think I am the only one here who should think about these questions

[14:51] <ugexe> We aren't talking about everyone else right now

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> We might have to because communication is a bi-directional thing

[14:52] *** dbonnafo joined
[14:53] <ugexe> It is, but it doesn't validate what-about-ism

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's not whataboutism that I don't think the people involved here have zero responsibility in the situation

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I am not willing to claim full responsibility, and that seems to be what you expect or imply here

[14:57] *** dbonnafo left
[14:57] <ugexe> "Seeing the sacrifices this community has already taken, I don't think I am the only one here who should think about these questions"

[14:57] <ugexe> this is a whataboutism

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the very same people are doing very familiar things

[15:00] <ugexe> I am being pretty explicit in that I'm talking about the communication style you use and how it can be improved to get more people to be receptive to what you say. I have no expectations that you will follow through on that.

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to be more specific: rendering a content problem as a tone problem

[15:02] <ugexe> it doesn't matter how right you are if no one will listen to you

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you are right about it but does that mean I should just do whatever it takes all against my convictions?

[15:05] *** Sgeo joined
[15:07] <ugexe> I'm not sure what your convictions are so I can't say for sure. Would your convictions be furthered if people were more receptive to your message / opinions? Or are your convictions furthered more by communicating in an absolutist way?

[15:14] <Xliff> Why is **@a better than *@a ?

[15:14] <Xliff> And is it possible we could make something less annoying than either?

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> lol

[15:16] <Xliff> In this situation, I would think "sub { ... }" to be a nice any-arg way to specify "a sub with any number of arguments that uses *@ARGS semantings"

[15:16] <Xliff> If you want a sub with no arguments, then that is spelled: "sub () { ... }"

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, what's so absolutist about saying that "I think" something should be done differently because it's "usually" not what people really want...

[15:16] <Xliff> However this is language design, and something tells me someone has already had this discussion

[15:17] <ugexe> Do you really think that is how your message came off?

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's literally what I said, damn it

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you know, this is why I'm skeptical at this point. It doesn't even matter what I say

[15:18] <tonyo> nemokosch: you can publish multiple running versions, so if you're maintaining v2.X and still developing v3.X it should let you do that

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I do make the compromises and it's not received at all

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> tonyo: okay gotcha, thank you

[15:19] <ugexe> It does matter what you say. I'm quite literally telling you this

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nemokosch: I do listen to what you say - even if I think it is wrong

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (and usually i will tell you honestly what I think)

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> what you (or anyone else) have not done is a sensible worked example of why **@a is a better style than *@a and I genuinley need to read (or write) this to be convinced that the regular *@ARGS syntax I have used for years could be done in a better way

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think it's a problem if we disagree about something

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> **@a is a better stylel than *@a

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ sorry Discord is swallowing my stars

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but I also don't think every time two people disagree about something, the right solution is to just announce that "it's a matter of preference" and call it a day

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> when you say "X should be deprecated" you are saying "anyone using X is doing it wrong and we will forbid this option since it is not in the zen of raku"

[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and I think "I want a programming language that does not force me to do things in a certain way"

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know if I can even agree with this but actually I only said "soft deprecate", leaving it up to further specification, and generally talking about educating people to learn **@a as the basic thing

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> frankly, none of us are making claims only in order to make points, right?

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - you need to convince me with some worked examples ... even better if your examples can be then repurposed directly in the docs to show the benefits of the double assterisk

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, the biggest advantage is that it really just does what Xliff also asked about here

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it really just collects positional arguments into one variable/symbol

[15:34] *** jgaz joined
[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It is much harder to assume that somebody purposefully feeds nested structures in and wants them to be flattened. There are two parts: the potential (ie. making the abstraction over argument lists that might flatten for whatever benefit) and the actuality (ie. the caller knows the structure for sure)

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> For the latter case: if the caller knows it for sure what the arguments look like, then it doesn't make much of a difference. They actually have more fine-grained control without auto-flattening because they can either do something like .flat or something like .Slip for starters

[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> For the former case: well, that's where I would like to see an example. In what situation do you think: "whatever the arguments may be, they definitely need to be flattened out"?

[15:41] <ugexe> I would wonder if users lean towards *@_ due to their first introduction being `MAIN(*@_)` examples, where structure is not relevant

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for example, I found such an example for deepmap at least, after a pretty long time: tree traversal

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but to use the arguments of a function to represent a tree, that sounds more than a bit peculiar

[15:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ugexe: I suspect that's where I got my bad? habit

[15:49] *** sjn left
[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am happy with the current design of raku and my current habit ... what you are saying is that the choice to flatten should be with the caller, what I suspect is sometimes yes sometimes no  (ie the callee is the boss) depending on the API you want ... anyway I am not trying to convince you to not use double star @a

[15:55] *** sjn joined
[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I will definitely use the double star when I have something like a set of recursive tree traversal functions

[15:59] <ugexe> speaking of trees... does anyone use .tree? :P

[15:59] <ugexe> I know Larry did...

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I didn't know it existed

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> only Data::Dump::Tree

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the examples didn't help me understand how it works 😅

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, my biggest concern isn't that somebody uses *@a in an informed way; more that people who just want to learn how to collect all arguments into a single list will pick this one up and later find that "something weird happened"

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> How easy it is to use the Selenium webdriver (of Chrome) in Raku? I see "Selenium::WebDriver" at raku.land -- has anyone used it?

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> how can we leverage the Advent Calendar to attract some converts?

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [since most languages do their own advent these days having copied the idea from perl/raku]

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Easy -- make LLM-based applications and AI-image-generation workflows.

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaay - I had a couple of ideas for LLM "apps" coming off your preso ... so I could pick up and learn that stuff and write my Raku Advent submission as an LLM oriented piece

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> certainly its the hot topic ...

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> question for the wider community: can we / should we each focus our submissions on LLM (we need ~ 25 in total and a willingness to suborn our personal priorities to the LLM theme)

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ?

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's a good question...

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [btw I am happy to take on the advent github "marshall" role if that is needed]

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Nemokosch: ... well what do you think?

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think that I'm both fairly clueless with LLM and largely uninterested

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so it's kinda hard to be enthusiastic

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but I'd be a hypocrite to not offer a helping hand if I see something gets going with it

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is anyone interested / enthusiastic in Antons idea?

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (off to bed now will look for replies in the morning my time)

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will consider making a related blog post.

[23:57] <tbrowder__> nemokosch: i enjoyed yr presentation at raku conf. i like the idea of defining some workgroups for ppl to help in areas you pointed out. lizmat, [coke], fianalist, and the RSC can't do it all.

[23:57] <tbrowder__> (and  many others carrying a heavy load)

[23:58] <tbrowder__> roping in new ppl is cool
