[11:30] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4203

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu I have used Raku-mode with Emacs and Aquamacs. It is not that convenient or useful. It is, of course, better than just using the command line REPL. It really depends what you want to use Raku for.

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu When I started learning Raku Atom was still actively maintained and/or developed, So, it‚Äôs Raku/Perl6 plug-in was useful.

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> mostly I want good syntax highlighting and perhaps a ctag equivalent, but even with vim I can't have that, so just good syntax highlighting will be good enough

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu Consider then using Commaide and/or IntelliJ with Comma‚Äôs plugin.

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> that's outside of emacs, isn't it?

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Absolutely, outside of Emacs. üôÇ

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> ah well I want to learn Emacs, I just expect to have to edit raku files with it quite a bit.

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> isn't there any emacs guru in the raku community?

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Or a Raku guru in the Emacs community‚Ä¶

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Raku community is crowded with vi-addicts.

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> lol I'm one of these addicts, and I want to go to rehab üôÇ

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Some of them have made daring attempts of using vim. (With Raku.)

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> not sure what you mean

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Doesn‚Äôt matter‚Ä¶

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I used Emacs a lot for programming, but right now I use Emacs mostly for/with org-mode.

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> yeah org mode is what gives me FOMO

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> So, I was very interested to do Literate Programming (LT) with Raku in babel-mode. (In Emacs.) But that is very incomplete at this point.

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> It has been in my to do list for at least 1.5 years to figure out how make ZeroMQ connection from Emacs to Raku. (And have LT in that way.)

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> @Nemokosch what's the status of that, though?  does it work well for raku now?

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Again, that is ‚Äújust‚Äù syntax highlighting ‚Äî as far as know. It does not provide interactive experience.

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Also, Bscan made the corresponding Raku-mode for VS. Code.

[12:00] *** reportable6 left
[12:00] *** reportable6 joined
[12:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu There is a Emacs to Raku Lisp script that allows evaluation Babel. I will find it in the next hour or so‚Ä¶

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I don't know what Babel is.  To me it evokes a javascript translator or something.

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> See https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I see.  Is that the thing people use to do literate programming in emacs?

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, that is one way‚Ä¶ There are others, depends how much LT you want.

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> I think I'll look into LTS.  That is probably the only way to deal with raku's complexity anyway.

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <grondilu> huh I mean LSP or something Language Server thing

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yeah, good luck!

[12:28] *** p6steve joined
[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ... I would like to see @Nemokosch reinstated please (since his 24 hour term has been served)

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I would feel the same if I were you

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Well, I have reviewed some of the things I said and I was quite pompous ... and it not like I have a right to tell you what to say or how to say it

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> the current situation is a bit of a dilemma and I'm a bit lost myself in terms of what would be the right thing to do. I'm not sure what lizmat's opinion on this would be given Nemokosch appears to have maintained the same stance. I mostly avoided reinstating them to minimize similar arguments for the time being

[12:41] <lizmat> Zephyr I'm sorry to hear that

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> well, I'm not a moderator --- thankfully --- but it is very odd having a bridge and then excluding someone from one side but no the other

[12:42] <lizmat> Zephyr yeah, I'd say re-instate for now

[12:43] <lizmat> we'll cross that bridge (again) if they go off the rails again

[12:43] <lizmat> no pun intended btw :-)

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> so... Nemokosch, is it alright if I reinstate you now?

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> lol

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> @Nemokosch ?

[12:45] <lizmat> I guess if  they do break discord's rules, it can be dealt on discord's side

[12:45] <lizmat> on the #raku side, there's always the advise to /ignore discord-raku-bot

[12:46] *** discord-raku-bot left
[12:46] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> alright, reinstated

[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> thanks

[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> ignoring the whole bridge though seems a bit extreme to say the least...

[12:47] <lizmat> Zephyr thanks for your work

[12:47] <lizmat> well, I wish there were a technical way to not have to do that

[12:47] <lizmat> the alternative would be to kick and/or ban, but that would affect *all* users of #raku

[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> is there no way to ignore a specific message pattern in IRC?

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> Irssi seems to have something for that https://irssi.org/documentation/help/ignore/

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I'm not sure about other clients

[12:51] <lizmat> good idea

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Zephyr I guess I will finish and productize the Code of Conduct Censuring Classifier (C4) and we can use it to classify the messages over the bridge and in general.

[13:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Of course, author‚Äôs handle can be a variable in classification process. (E.g. if $handle (elem) <Nemokosch> then ‚Äúdo-not-post‚Äù.)

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I'm not exactly sure about the whole context but not posting Nemokosch's messages over the bridge at all isn't as viable of a solution here considering that's what was done a bit ago which was requested to be reverted just now and done so

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> instead the problem is client-specific commands for ignoring a specific user's messages over the bridge without affecting others

[13:11] <ab5tract> that doesn't sound fixable from the bridge, to be honest

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I suspect that the irc - discord bridge has been a sea change for the irc side - discord being more approachable, discoverable and generally active (you can see active discord communities around Rust, Python and so on)

[13:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> At some point C4 has to be made to apply per person ‚Äî people can use it to both filter the messages they read and to self-censor what they post.

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> nevertheless, imo this has been a big positive for Raku, helping more of us be active in the chat more of the time (but no doubt diluting some of the technical focus of the irc side)

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> what I fear is that it will get very confusing if some folk are only heard on one side of the other, and I would request that our respected moderators work together so that the rules and action on both sides are consistent and uniform to avoid this

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Since Nemokosch has posted a lot in the last 1.8 years, I can easily use his messages as ‚Äúdo not post‚Äù baseline training text for C4. (Together with the feedback of others on those messages.)

[13:18] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I probably need this for my email too

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> this could be big in China

[13:19] <ab5tract> p6steve: IIUC, you are saying that a ban should be applied to both Discord and IRC, and not just the bridge?

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ^^ yes

[13:20] <ab5tract> that's the only sensible course IMO

[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> be careful, since you know he has hair trigger reactions

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> ...I'm a bit confused where this conversation is headed

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I think hair triggers are abundant, hence we need something like C4.

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> what exactly is C4?

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Code of Conduct Censoring Classifier == C4

[13:28] <ab5tract> I don't know him very well but I don't see how deactivating a bridge helps to resolve an underlying issue of concern for whether someone's contributions are negative/positive for the community

[13:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I got that much but I'm not exactly sure what those terms represent here

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Zephyr C4 is project that makes mathematical artifacts ‚Äî classifiers ‚Äî that can be used to label text as acceptable or not within the context of forum messages (say, of certain community.)

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> that to me sounds like it would have a lot of false positives to say the least...

[13:32] <ab5tract> Well, Anton has demoed some pretty magical ML before... but yeah, I don't know if I see it being useful outside of maybe informing a user that they are crossing boundaries that have previously resulted in a ban?

[13:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> C4 can have a ‚Äúset of sliders‚Äù that help personalize it per user.

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @ab5tract Sure, but a classifier like that can be used to analyze, cluster, and segregate a text corpus of messages. Hence, the moderators can form more informed opinions about what, or who, or which to ban.

[13:40] <ab5tract> I think we are still talking about two different things. One is an operational idea (C4), one is a methodological question (does a temporary ban from a bridge actually deter any harmful behavior?)

[13:42] <lizmat> I'm all for having more options

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> So much fuss of so little value. You could just tell me to get lost and call it a day ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[14:03] <lizmat> it should mean something to you that that is not the case

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Nemokosch C4 could be easily ‚Äútuned‚Äù into telling you to get lost. (Over email, SMS, and, of course, Discord.)

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, it does mean something - but it also means something that people who tried much harder and longer than I did, all bounced back from the very same "hardcore" that mistakes itself with "the community"

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is nothing to earn here

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> @Anton Antonov thank you; a truly noble service provider ^^

[14:41] <lizmat> *sigh*

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> the majority of the issues you raise are incorrect and you are never able to accept that you are wrong --- there is no hardcore of resistance, just a community of people contributing their time freely where many disagree with you

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I find this pattern very annoying

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The majority of the issues I raise are not incorrect - this is where we part

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I estimate that you are objectively correct about 30% of the time

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And the reactions provided by those people who could do anything about it - yes, they are the "hardcore" - are very disillusional

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the members of the Raku Steering Council + Tony O'Dell, basically

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> now that JJ Merelo resigned, I don't think anybody needs to be excluded explicitly

[14:49] <lizmat> not even Daniel Sockwell ?

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I had tremendous hopes in Daniel Sockwell actually

[14:50] <lizmat> or Geoffrey Broadwell ?

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but somebody who only shows up twice a year, cannot actually change the big picture, if not for Community Affairs Team...

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Last time Geoffrey Broadwell showed up was when he asked about Documentable that has been abandoned for a year

[14:52] <lizmat> so let me get this straight: they are against change because you think they spend less time on Raku than you expect them to ?

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> to be fair, I don't know what they have in mind because they barely have visible activity

[14:54] <lizmat> yet you just lumped them together in "the members of the Raku Steering Council + Tony O'Dell, basically"

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which is, I agree, a different thing than actively blocking any attempts to change things on a bigger scale

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, sorry for being inaccurate? They are not at the right place, though, if that matters

[14:55] <lizmat> ah, you were being inaccurate?   I guess that doesn't happen very often

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I guess it doesn't happen that some of you diverge from the topic by nitpicking

[14:56] <ab5tract> what is the topic, exactly?

[14:56] <lizmat> people against change in the Raku community, apparently

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That the state of this project, much like as a "theme park", is determined by the solid number of people who use their knowledge and power to simply outlast those people who ever wanted to treat it as a project

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Either by active effort or just by sheer passivity and indifference

[14:58] <ugexe> you are tilting at windmills 

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, windmills like you personally

[14:59] <ab5tract> so your idea of treating Raku like a project is to denigrate its main contributors?

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> you are confusing the re-opening of long settled issues with the desire to make progress

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> somebody said that the measure of contributions doesn't matter!

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> (which I think, by the way, is an absolutely demoralizing statement, but then let's take it seriously)

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Also, a lot of things are being treated as laws of nature - resisting any sort of management is one such a thing.

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> As if being subject to certain common goals would be the same thing as sending somebody to Gulag

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Any time the topic of dedicating X proportion of existing resources to goal Y came up, there were these people who de facto vetoed it immediately

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Talking about selflessness

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And yes, this is "long settled", in the sense that it predates my presence by years at least

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Perhaps you would get more support for your goals if you made more convincing arguments and built support for your ideas

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes - and this would be so much easier if people like Zoffix, AlexDaniel and eventually JJ Merelo didn't burn out of lack of any reception of such ideas

[15:06] <ab5tract> You are putting words into JJ's mouth, at the very least

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not putting any words into JJ's mouth

[15:06] <ab5tract> when and where did he declare exasperation at having his ideas ignored?

[15:06] <tonyo> where did he write that he was burnt out because his ideas went unheard?

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <shmup> Is this conductive at all, or interesting, right now

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what I'm saying is that he is among the people who have been trying to take care of this project, and it wasn't received basically at all

[15:07] <tonyo> is that your opinion or did he write that somewhere?

[15:07] <tonyo> jj implemented a lot of change

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> each and every one of the named people did

[15:07] <tonyo> .tell rf check out the new usages in fez dist branch - i think i just gave it a big upgrade

[15:07] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to rf

[15:08] <tonyo> is that your opinion or did jj write that somewhere?

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't know about it if he did, but it would be also a misjudgement to frame this as an opinion. Read up on the problem-solving repo

[15:11] <lizmat> With regards to change and Zoffix

[15:11] <lizmat> Zoffix left the Raku Community partially because of me

[15:11] <lizmat> at the time, I was still following TimToady's vision of (now) Raku being the next version of Perl

[15:12] <lizmat> Zoffix was of the opinion that the name should be changed

[15:12] <lizmat> and Raku was his proposal for at least an alias

[15:12] <lizmat> with the release of 6.d, a giant misunderstanding caused Zoffix to really want to know from TimToady what the status of the alias was

[15:13] <lizmat> TimToady to this day, did not answer their question

[15:13] <lizmat> after waiting for 2 months, Zoffix chose to leave

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> By the way, hopefully it goes without saying that none of you are being "attacked", and as for lizmat, to me at least, it does matter that somebody is actually getting things done

[15:13] <shmup> do we miss Zoffix

[15:13] <lizmat> It took me another 9 months to realize that Zoffix had been right

[15:14] *** abraxxa-home joined
[15:14] <shmup> aw

[15:14] <lizmat> and proposed the name change to Raku in Riga in 2019

[15:15] <ab5tract> just to clarify: Zoffix left after setting an *ultimatum*, which has never gone over well with the community

[15:15] <lizmat> now, if you're going to say that I'm against change out of principle, I think you are wrong, very wrong

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/203 this issue (and its predecessor issue) is the quintessence (okay, one possible quintessence) of the problem

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it reflects a whole lot of things

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and it seems to me that there was more hope (or at least more time at disposal for the active members) around that time

[15:18] *** abraxxa-home left
[15:18] <lizmat> perhaps there was indeed.   But Covid took away a lot of time from core developers, and the war in Ukraine is definitely also a big distractor for some core developers

[15:19] <lizmat> to come back to "By the way, hopefully it goes without saying that none of you are being "attacked"

[15:19] <lizmat> no, it does not:   many of your interactions *ARE* being interpreted as attacks, or at least as being "toxic"

[15:20] <lizmat> and that's something I hear from people *VERY* new to the Raku Community

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I thought interpretations don't count - not if I interpret something some way, at least

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> even if he does not intend to

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for covid + war in Ukraine: point is, something was going to happen anyway. Something always happens. https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/5

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I have just seen this issue in the last couple of days, guess which participants I see on the right side of the story...

[15:23] <lizmat> ah, so there's a right and a wrong side ?

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> In retrospective, we may say that there is

[15:23] <lizmat> no, you said: "which participants I see on the right side of the story"

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What follows?

[15:23] <lizmat> words matter.   

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What does that mean to you, then?

[15:24] <lizmat> it means to me that you always have your opinion ready and are incapable of introspection or empathy

[15:25] <lizmat> or should I soften that with "we may say?"

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It means that I could count on which people will make the good points

[15:25] *** yjh joined
[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And yes, this is telling, telling about the people

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's not surprising who said that it would be quintessential to get more contributors - way more important than to use the existing resources efficiently.

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And in retrospective, it seems that these people were pretty damn right.

[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And the irony is: I would be substantially less active in a parallel universe where these people were taken seriously enough.

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Because it would be all up to people who were much better at doing this!

[15:29] <lizmat> ah, so you want to be less active so that other people can do more?

[15:29] <lizmat> that's not how open source works

[15:29] <lizmat> or any volunteer effort

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not "less active"

[15:30] <shmup> intermission time. everyone take a few big breaths. ah feels good

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's not the right conclusion

[15:31] <lizmat> shmup: good idea, I will recuse myself

[15:31] *** lizmat left
[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm rather saying that these people were too selfish when they were shown to make a sacrifice to invoke more contributors

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because that wouldn't have been efficient enough for them

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the contributors didn't came, covid and war in Ukraine happened, the people who pursued a project management perspective slowly vanished (for often related reasons)

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> we are back to a situation possibly somewhat worse than 2 or 3 years ago, and the problem is still not the mindset that even justifies not doing stuff, not helping out and so on

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the problem is still not the statement "everybody contributes as much as they feel like and that's that", coming from someone the most grown to the project

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the problem is still my attitude. If my attitude is the problem, I can just let all of you be, no problem.

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> However, I don't see how that solution will turn Raku, in its eighth "released" year, into a real-life project, rather than a theme park of a handful of people. And that hurts me, and I can't understand how it doesn't hurt lizmat, ugexe, tonyo, nine, vrurg and whoever else, just enough.
