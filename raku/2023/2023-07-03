[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or     use Image::Magick:from<Perl5>; perhaps?

[21:51] <Xliff> librasteve: Thanks for the suggestions, but those to -not-, I'm sorry to say. The PIL in Python is specifically for hacking things like TXT blocks into PNG images, so I need a way to decompress PNG in memory.

[22:14] *** jpn joined
[22:18] *** jpn left
[22:18] <timo> i wonder, isn't the parts you need to do in order to add a TXT block into a png completely separate from compression? i think image data blocks are "internally" compressed and can freely move around in the file without having to change?

[22:19] <timo> but i may be confusing png for a different image format
