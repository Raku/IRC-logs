[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, heredoc strings are a nice quality-of-life micro-feature

[12:21] <moritz> isn't not really a micro-feature, in the sense that it does make the parser significantly more complicated

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> on the other hand it has no runtime impact

[12:28] <Voldenet> heredocs that support tab/space trimming gets it even more complicated

[12:28] <Voldenet> the syntax in PHP is straight out of perl btw

[12:31] <Voldenet> C# needed 11 versions to get proper heredocs (they called it raw string literals)

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > C# 11 Preview Updates – Raw string literals, UTF-8 and more!

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it seems not only that took them 11 versions...

[12:35] <Voldenet> that utf-8 is a not useless, but it's made to win at some benchmarks…

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> also, very bluntly put, Raku sacrificed quite a lot of parsing benefits with this approach where you can basically switch to a different sub-language by any token

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so just as much it's good to see the beneficial part of that trade-off, well, any trade-off should have benefits, right?

[12:39] <Voldenet>   _should_

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh I think these things should also get some showtime. "So you say Raku's grammar is complex and it's hard to inform the user where a certain syntax error could happen? In return, you get a decent remedy to a challenge that gives everybody a headache in pretty much all languages"

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> - complex grammar - no backtracking parser

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this was mentioned not so long ago - actually the latter is decided by the former

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you want to allow "deviations" (like switching to a slang at any point and then back), backtracking will be too much....
