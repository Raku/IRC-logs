[01:07] <[Coke]> nemokosch: I actually started a branch for that on zef-deps called 'inverse' that got stalled.

[01:07] *** xinming joined
[01:09] <[Coke]> knowing someone else wants it makes it more important, will bump it higher in queue

[01:16] <tbrowder__> here's another vote

[01:29] <[Coke]> ... huh, appaerntly i was further along than I remembered

[01:30] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/baa93398f5363294245339e96a16650e

[01:33] <[Coke]> I think that's just one layer deep

[01:34] <[Coke]> guessing I also want to default to not showing version or auth and collapsing entries so if search for --inverse Slang::Tuxic I don't get 12 Textg::CSV's, all slightly different.

[01:36] <[Coke]> I guess we'd want --verbose and --recursive or something.

[07:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, that would be great

[07:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "your mileage may vary" but I think the default should be that only the highest version of a certain dist counts

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, I don't know

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> collapsing subsequent versions that all depend on the same dist (um, module actually) makes sense

[07:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know how easy it is to retrieve different versions of a dist

[18:53] <pony> can the .identifier parts be an in-place pattern here? <key=.identifier> '=' <value=.identifier> <comment>?

[20:05] <pony> is there an eval bot I can use to demonstrate?

[20:08] <jdv> m: 'foo'.say

[20:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1c6261c4: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[20:08] <pony> thanks

[20:09] <pony> m: grammar G { token TOP { <foo='ab'> } } say G.parse: 'ab';

[20:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1c6261c4: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in metachar:sym<assert>; couldn't find final '>' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> grammar G { token TOP { <foo=⏏'ab'> } } say G.parse: 'ab'…»

[20:09] <jdv> iirc m is for moar.  idk.

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @pony Consider using Discord.

[20:10] <jdv> irc forever!

[20:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> LOL !!!

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> isn't that $<foo>='ab' ? or what is the goal?

[20:33] <pony> grammar G { token TOP { <foo=.ab> }; token ab { ab } }; say G.parse: 'ab' # to have this without the extra token definition

[20:34] <evalable6> pony, rakudo-moar 4b69dd51e: OUTPUT: «｢ab｣␤ foo => ｢ab｣␤»

[20:34] <pony> so replacing the .ab with an in-place pattern

[20:34] <pony> I want to know if it's allowed

[20:35] <pony> oh

[20:35] * pony saw your other message
