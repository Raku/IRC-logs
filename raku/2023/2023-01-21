[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Ideally I would like a Str to feed into a method ```df0.read_csv("$t-path");```

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> all the above from zef install ...

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> any clues very welcome, please!

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Xliff: on Inline::Perl5, I use it extensively here https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dan-Pandas eg. ```df.pd: '.to_csv("test.csv")';```

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ```

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> multi method pd( $exp ) {

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve>     if $exp ~~ /'='/ {

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve>         $!po.rs_exec( $exp )

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve>     } else {

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve>     }

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ```

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> where ```$!po``` is a perl5 pandas object (eg. a Series) ... so you may be able to copy my example and make a "receiver" on the perl side and then load into your "sender" raku object

[17:13] <ugexe> So I plan on removing META.info support from zef soon

[17:14] <ugexe> zef has been warning for 5 years that failure was likely, and rakudo hasn't supported it period for a similar amount of time

[17:14] <ugexe> i think every distribution with a META.info has a multi-year old PR opened for changing to META6.json

[17:16] <ugexe> as for why now, because apparently the workaround support in zef for META.info had been broken some time ago unless installing from a cloned directory. so for normal users i don't think anyone will notice

[17:18] *** japhb left
[17:25] <ugexe> It might make sense to remove those distributions from REA

[17:25] <ugexe> but we'd probably want to have an idea of if any of those distributions are depended on by anything else

[17:26] <ugexe> and move any that are to the raku community modules with a META6.json, deleting the prior versions that will no longer be installable

[17:30] <coleman> Is it possible to publish a concrete list of dists that would be affected? Only if that's easy to get from a script, of course

[17:33] <ugexe> it'd probably need to clone the REA github repo, open each tar file, and then look at the files

[17:35] <ugexe> my $extractor = Zef::Service::Shell::Tar.new. say "META.info found" if so $extractor.ls-files($filename).grep({ $_ eq "META.info" });

[17:36] <ugexe> assuming you had all the archive files you could use something like that to check of the .tar.gz file contains a META.info

[17:37] <ugexe> a list probably already exists from 5 years ago when all those PRs to update them to META6.json were made

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyone got any ideas on this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75190418/no-single-root-directory-found-all-dists-must-extract-to-a-single-directory-e

[18:22] <coleman> ugexe: after our docs work is done, I would like to proprose to my infra comrades that we explore fixing up QA automation that can help with stuff like this

[18:23] <coleman> That's a few weeks away for me personally at least, but be thinking on what might be useful and high-impact to help the package ecosystem. 

[18:23] <coleman> maybe there are old or proposals I can review, etc.
