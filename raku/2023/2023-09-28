[06:58] <etothepiiminus1> Hi all, i love the flexibility of the grammar and parsing functionality to easily create custom operators like sub postfix:<[]>(\terms) {

[06:58] <etothepiiminus1>     terms[0] terms[1]

[06:58] <etothepiiminus1> }

[06:58] <etothepiiminus1> my $result = (3, 4)[];  # Should return 12

[06:58] <etothepiiminus1> say "Result in Raku: $result";

[06:58] <etothepiiminus1> Likewise for easily chanfing json syntax etc.    Is anyone aware of any textbooks ghat got into the theory of this? It would be ideal if raku were the language of example but just as interested in engineering/deigning custom formats.

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Great!

[15:35] <ugexe> tbrowder__: zef will by default prefix any regular path (like /some/path) with `inst#` because of complaints. I usually write inst#/some/path myself

[15:39] <tbrowder__> thnx, then why do you need the ‚Äúsite‚Äù method. isn‚Äôt that too much abstraction? zef docs could definitely use some shortening üòÅ

[15:44] <tbrowder__> El_Che: ++ another smooth debian raku upgrade, thnx!

[16:07] <tbrowder__> btw, what is the oldest debian release you are supporting?

[16:36] <El_Che> tbrowder__: I need to have a proper look, because I do nothing special with zef. It's installed by root and there is a script to install it as a user. Nothing is changed or preconfigured.

[16:36] <El_Che> tbrowder__: debian 11

[18:29] <Xliff> I'm currently running through dev tests (dev-t) in my GLib package, and am running into memory issues with dev-t/10-hashtable.t

[18:29] <Xliff> I'm getting flapping behavior for it. Would love it if someone else could take a gander and see if it's something completely obvious.

[18:30] <Xliff> pakku add GLib; git clone https://github.com/Xliff/p6-gLib; cd p6-GLib; raku dev-t/10-hashtable.t

[18:30] <Xliff> ^^ Installation instructions.

[18:31] <Xliff> If you aren't on Debian or Ubuntu, you will run into installation errors, which are easily resolvable. I just don't have the data for other distros.

[18:37] <tonyo> tbrowder__: no real sales pitch for it, it's helpful for say, someone like me or ugexe, who end up installing a ton of stuff we don't really need in an effort to debug.  it could also work in the same as python's virtual envs where rather than polluting the global namespaces you want to localize those installs to the project directory

[20:53] <tellable6> 2023-05-09T10:38:48Z #raku <El_Che> Nemokosch: with Perl family background etc, let's say the eye of the beholder applies :)

[20:53] <tellable6> 2023-05-22T22:02:00Z #raku <guifa> Nemokosch: I don't think it was so much weak typing with methods, as weak typing for when you do a quoted string list (akin to perl's @foo = qw(a 13 b c 93) ) so that they always pass the string test when passing to subs

[20:53] <tellable6> 2023-07-06T19:55:43Z #raku <rf> nemokosch: TCL is basically string theory
