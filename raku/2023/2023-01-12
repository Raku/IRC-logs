[00:03] <tonyo> haha anton: `becoming the best python programmer i know` !

[00:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> vrurg made the same joke with Python twice

[00:05] * guifa is still proud of his elders + BASIC joke

[00:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "if you wanted to implement... sorry for this word... PYTHON [on Rakudo maybe, not 100%]"

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @tonyo "haha anton: becoming the best python programmer i know !" -- Yeah, I like trolling the Pythonistas. üôÇ

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> The talk "Becoming the best Python programmer I know" was also rejected by the "Python dev room" committee at FOSDEM 2023.

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tonyo: this is somewhat off-topic but sometimes we need to bring in the good vibes as well... so the "zef ecosystem" has basically become the biggest Raku ecosystem in less than two years, if I can count

[00:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> This might be the biggest, visible achievement of 2022 in the Raku space

[00:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I plan to implement the core Mathematica language in Raku (using RakuAST.)

[00:12] <tonyo> maybe, it's hard to say without doing some analysis of cpan

[00:12] <tonyo> i've been waiting for rakuast to write a datalog ORM

[00:13] <tonyo> 2493 dists nemokosch

[00:13] <tonyo> from 124 authors

[00:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I decided I cannot wait for RakuAST for the development of my DSL projects, so I actively program "work-arounds".

[00:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> raku.land only knows like 2100 in total

[00:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "everything" (supposedly) considered

[00:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I did some data analysis of raku.land / zef ecosystem last year for TRC-2022.

[00:14] <tonyo> 115k downloads of those dists

[00:15] <tonyo> 2493 dists means unique Module:auth:ver:api 

[00:15] <tonyo> where is this, anton?

[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is this for all versions? ohh, gotcha, late

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Hmm... trying to find the links.

[00:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @tonyo Here is a teaser: https://imgur.com/33P7QmG

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I posted the corresponding notebook I do not think it can be seen without Wolfram Cloud account.

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ha, I saw HTML::Tag on it üòÑ

[00:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296>  I am using your IRC handle in examples often.

[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @tonyo In order to make the ‚ÄúZef ecosystem recommender‚Äù presented here : https://youtu.be/efRHfjYebs4&t=196s , I downloaded the Meta6 files and some/most of the README files (if they are ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to get.)

[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Just a fruitful example.

[00:30] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> maxim bollocks... üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[00:32] <rf> tonyo: Yeah I'm not sure how I would do it, but I think it can be simplified more.

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> wow that is nice :))

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Agh, I remember that ! Oh, well‚Ä¶ it illustrates well why in my DSLs I have to handle misspellings, etc.

[00:45] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> there's a lot packed into that presentation - üò∂

[00:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Did you attend the conference, good sir?

[00:49] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> sadly not - I'm not usually in the right part of the World.pm6 at the right time

[00:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh right :c

[00:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yeah, way too much‚Ä¶

[00:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's hard because there was already a sort of compromise, so that at least the east coast can join the mostly European core

[00:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but yeah, the "east coast" doesn't really refer to Melbourne

[00:52] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> where / when for 2023?

[00:54] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> this? https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/z90wkj/the_raku_conference_2023/

[00:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes

[00:55] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> oh that might be doable, as probably in the UK around that time...

[00:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the last two years (so basically all Raku Conferences) were online
