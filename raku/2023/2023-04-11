[00:15] <guifa> huh

[00:16] <guifa> shouldn't CORE::Foo always refer to the actual CORE thing?

[00:24] <guifa> ah never it does

[00:25] <guifa> I had a different bug 

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Maybe, working on date-formatting has caused some damage?

[00:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> (...brain damage.)

[00:34] <guifa> haha

[00:34] <guifa> the issue was me testing a timezone with a very odd offset

[00:34] <guifa> (specifically a one second offset)

[00:35] <guifa> For unknown zones, I just pass all the data to CORE::DateTime.new and then the fancier timezone aware ones initializes with a self.bless(year => core-result.year, month => core-result.month¬†‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) 

[00:35] <guifa> The problem was I was doing timezone => core-result.timezone, and I wrap that method on CORE so I was entering into an infinite loop

[14:34] <rf> Morning folks

[14:35] <lizmat> rf o/

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @rf Did you post anything Raku-related last weekend?

[14:37] <rf> No I have been having some house problems

[14:37] <rf> Been very busy

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> somebody was playing around with Humming-Bird, I think just yesterday

[14:37] <rf> :D

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure what the resolutions was, there was something with the encoding of the emitted HTML

[14:37] <rf> Yeah someone found a bug in the example I made, I patched that yesterday

[14:38] <rf> Hmm, I hope they're still around, I'd like to see that

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> by @snufkin : "I'm not sure the right place for this. But I am trying to make a web app with raku and Humming-Bird.  And I'm trying to display Chinese characters. They are not displaying correctly, I believe it's potentially a unicode issue, but I've no idea how to fix it. Google searches have not resulted in particularly useful information."

[14:40] <rf> Hmm, I will look into that

[14:42] <rf> Ah yes, that is fairly broken

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the charset didn't carry over or something

[14:43] <rf> Aha it's a browser issue

[14:43] <rf> He will need to add a <meta charset="UTF8"> tag

[14:44] <rf> It's broken for me until I do that at least

[14:45] <rf> snufkin: Please add a meta tag with charset="UTF-8" to your HTML and give it a try

[14:48] <lizmat> rf: maybe Humming-bird should assume UTF-8 if no charset specified ?

[14:50] <rf> It does internally, but the browser still just sees a bytestream iirc

[14:50] <rf> So if they want to use UTF8 they will need to tell the browser how to encode it, typically with a meta tag

[14:50] <lizmat> adding an output header ?

[14:51] <lizmat> I mean, it *is* the default for Raku

[14:51] <rf> That's definietley an option but I'm scared that will open a big can of worms, trying to parse the HTML before it goes over the wire and add the tag

[14:52] <lizmat> I didn't mean that: if there is no input header with a charset spec

[14:52] <lizmat> add an output header with a charset UTF8

[14:52] <rf> Ah yeah, you're right

[14:53] <rf> I will add that to the todo!

[14:54] <rf> To be completely honest, I thought I already did that, doh.

[16:36] <tonyo> you can add that meta tag if you're using ryml with `meta[ :charset<whatever> ]`
