[01:00] <whatnext> hello raku community :]

[01:01] <whatnext> how can I set an attribute declared in the parent in the TWEAK of the child?

[01:02] <whatnext> I get "Attribute $!id is not declared in class My::Class"

[01:03] <whatnext> any thoughts? :]

[02:07] <MasterDuke> m: class A { has $.a }; class B is A { has $.b; multi method new($n) { self.bless(a => $n) } }; say B.new(4).a¬†¬† # whatnext ^^^ it's not TWEAK, but would this accomplish what you're trying to do?

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am trying to get someone to install and use Raku, but they get messages about "psunzip" not being available, etc.

[12:27] <whatnext> hi all :]  re-asking my question from earlier:

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Do you /  did you have Raku installation problems like that? I pointed them to : https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/341#issuecomment-611459217 . Does the advise there work?

[12:27] <whatnext> how can I set an attribute declared in the parent in the TWEAK of the child?

[12:28] <whatnext> I get "Attribute $!id is not declared in class My::Class" ...?

[12:34] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a is rw }; class B is A { method TWEAK { self.a = 42 } }; dd B.new.a

[12:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar e702f0e6a: OUTPUT: ¬´Int $!a = 42‚ê§¬ª

[12:34] <lizmat> whatnext ^^

[12:40] <whatnext> thanks lizmat - that looks like the way I'd expect it to work. Not sure why I'm getting an error though. If $.a is not rw and I set $!a that also should work? And would it make a difference if "required" ? I am trying to figure what might be causing that error

[12:40] <lizmat> the attribute *must* be marked as "is rw", otherwise it won't work

[12:40] <whatnext> ah really

[12:40] <whatnext> that explains it then

[12:41] <lizmat> well, there are other ways...

[12:41] <whatnext> for example?

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> $!a is like object private

[12:41] <lizmat> but if the class has indicated that the attribute is not to be changed from outside, you should probably respect that

[12:41] <whatnext> yes... but I figured the child would still have access

[12:41] <lizmat> access is ok

[12:42] <whatnext> but cannot set?

[12:42] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a = 42 }; class B is A { }; dd B.new.a

[12:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar e702f0e6a: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> to $!a ? it probably won't

[12:44] <whatnext> yes I guess I meant that in the TWEAK of the child, $!a declared in the parent cannot be set - is this correct?

[12:44] <lizmat> not unless the parent allows it

[12:45] <whatnext> the parent allows it by marking it "rw" ?

[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> $.foo stuff is essentially a method, and these methods can be marked "is rw". From what I know, the actual data with the ! is always object private; basically there is no syntax to access it in a high-level way

[12:48] <whatnext> haha great bot :]

[12:48] <lizmat> well, there is, but it's butt ugly, using introspection

[12:48] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a }; class B is A { method TWEAK { self.^mro[1].^attributes.first(*.name eq q/$!a/).set_value(self,42) } }; say B.new.a

[12:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar e702f0e6a: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[12:50] <whatnext> ok that looks complicated '=D

[12:50] <whatnext> I think the "rw" solution will work - thanks lizmat

[14:14] <lizmat> rf o/

[14:17] <rf> How are things today lizmat?

[14:18] <lizmat> interesting and a bit exciting: trying to re-implement pod parsing as a true slang

[14:18] <rf> Oooh sounds like fun!

[14:18] <rf> Best of luck :D

[14:18] <lizmat> well, the fun comes when it works, so far it is mostly torture   :-)

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I used "‚üπ" in monadic pipelines before I discovered Raku. I like Raku's forward feed operator, "==>".

[15:16] <ugexe> Anton Antonov: that error message means they have no program that can extract whatever archive the distribution is. if its from fez then they don't have a program that can extract a tar file in their PATH, if its a zip file they don't have 'unzip' or 'powershell' in their PATH, etc

[15:18] *** rf left
[15:35] *** rf joined
[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @ugexe Thanks! So, the correct paths of "unzip" and "powershell" have to be specified.

[15:40] <ugexe> er, not exactly i was simplifying it to unixy terms

[15:41] <ugexe> to be more precise, they need either a `unzip` or `powershell` command to be available

[15:41] <ugexe> they might not exist in $PATH, but on a unixy system that is what that usually means

[15:41] <ugexe> im guessing they need the tar command

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @ugexe üôÇ thank you. I know they had unzip when we talked.

[15:42] <ugexe> modern windows 10 comes with one i think

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I should try to make a Windows 10 virtual environment in some cloud service.
