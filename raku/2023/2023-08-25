[11:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, this was meant to illustrate how cool this bot is
[11:21] <wafflus> it's verry cool though probally a bit ahead in my understanding :)
[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's just, if you really run out of options why something doesn't work, or works differently
[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then you can check if there has been a change
[11:22] <wafflus> nice
[11:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> here for example I'm positive that the current behavior of something ~~ Type() is borked
[11:23] <wafflus> so its a actuall bug in raku itself?

[11:36] <kjp> What I am getting out is that : only introduces arhuments to methods, and a bare say is a function, and not a method.
[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> interesting
[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, we did trace down what happened for say: "d", 5
[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> say: became a label
[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the question is: should it be allowed to become a label there?
[11:38] <kjp> Interesting question, but allowing a colon there to introduce arguments o a function would at least be very confusing.
[11:38] <kjp> Being a syntax error would be more useful.
[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh right, what I originally mistook it for was say "d": 5
[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that would be the equivalent of "d".say(5)
[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but for labels, all I can find is that they are meant to denote loops
[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> we have a bare expression here, not a loop
[11:41] <kjp> True, but I'm not au fait with things at that level. I can't remember the last time I used a label in any language other than assembler (and that's over 20 years ago).
[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> who are you, if I may? What is your relation to Raku? I can see you have been around for a couple of years at least, and I used to think you were the IRC account of the late Kaiepi
[11:43] <kjp> Nope; just a retired sysadmin who used a lot of perl over the years and has been interested in and writing some raku for the last decade or so.
[11:44] <kjp> I just checked -- one git repo going back to November 2013, so a decade is about right.
[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's solid 😄
[11:45] <kjp> solid maybel; whether it's sane or not given some of the things I write is another matter.
[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what may be insane about it? The task? The density of the code? The reliance on metamodel features?
[11:50] <kjp> The types of things; with other languages probably being a lot more suitable.

[17:14] <hythm76> `nqp:sha1(<ab>.any)` # should this work?
[17:14] <gfldex> no
[17:14] <hythm76> why not
[17:14] <tbrowder__> i'm having trbl using El_Che's rakudo-pkg with two new debian systems. i'm trying to have root's zef modules usable by ordinary users unless they want to install their own. i think in theory that should work without a lot of effort, but getting the paths and pieces to work together has so far escaped my attempts.
[17:14] <Xliff> Containers?
[17:15] <gfldex> Because NQP isn't part of Raku. Also, NQP doesn't really know about Junctions, at least not on NQP-Ops.
[17:15] <Xliff> tbrowder__: Hmmm.... even Ubuntu's paths are subtally different from stock Debian. Do you need another test system to run against?
[17:16] <Xliff> gfldex: Don't you mean that the other way 'round? NQP is a part of Raku, but Raku is NOT a part of NQP?
[17:17] <gfldex> No, NQP is not part of Raku. There are no tests that ask for NQP-Ops in Roast.
[17:17] <Xliff> hythm76: You would need to use the part of the Junction class that stores the individual items.
[17:17] <Xliff> gfldex: Yet you can "use nqp" and Raku won't work without it.
[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Raku could work without NQP in theory
[17:17] <gfldex> You can, because Rakudo is build with NQP. Other Raku implementation might not.
[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's rather Rakudo that is based on NQP
[17:18] <Xliff> gfldex: True, but there is only one, right now.
[17:18] <gfldex> If you `use nqp;` you are in impementation-detail-land where one can easily get lost.
[17:18] <Xliff> And nemokosch has the righter interpretation of it.
[17:18] <hythm76> so what is the difference between calling `nqp::sha1($j), and calling it inside of a sub body `sub foo ( $j ) { nqp::sha1($j) };`?
[17:18] <Xliff> gfldex: This is also understood. However it is the direction that will confuse most people. That's my only point.
[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hythm76: I think the right question to ask is whether the call to foo distributes the junction or not
[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if it does then we have an answer
[17:19] <gfldex> Indeed. Exposing nqp by Rakudo may have been a mistake.
[17:19] <Xliff> hythm76: The internals of how Junction are passed to a sub is allowing that to work.
[17:20] <Xliff> gfldex: No tears over spilled milk...
[17:20] *** vlad left
[17:20] <Xliff> nemokosch: It does, and it is.
[17:20] <gfldex> Junctions are a side-effect (so to speak) of MMD and there is no MMD on NQP-Ops.
[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> at the end of the day, we are all saying the same thing, then
[17:21] <Xliff> Yep.
[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> moreover, if I have this right, if you did sub foo(Mu $j), suddenly that would also fail
[17:21] <gfldex> Xliff: If you use anything that is not in Roast, it's going to be your tears, not mine. So I'm good if you spill some milk. :->
[17:22] <hythm76> nemokosch: yes sub foo(Mu $j) failed
[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, so there is the answer, then: Junction is a "high-level" feature of the core, and it's the default type constraint Any that triggered the resolution of it
[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think the runtime, or even NQP, knows anything about Junctions
[17:24] <Xliff> gfldex: I'm not the one lamenting a decision that has had unintended benefits for Raku and the Community over it's last 8 years of existence over an issue that is largely academic.
[17:25] <Xliff> gfdex: hythm76 asked a question, that was answered without mentioning NQP-Ops or Roast. 
[17:25] <Xliff> gfdex: Fortunately, I think we've arrived at an answer. Thanks for your input.
[17:26] <gfldex> I'm pointing out facts. Nothing more, nothing less. If that offends you, there is /ignore for you. You don't have to ready anything I write.
[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> from my personal perspective, it's fortunate that Junction lives solely in the core because I know the core much more than NQP or the runtime
[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, anybody can understand the core reasonably well, all it takes is Raku knowledge and a little bit of NQP knowledge
[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this describes the dynamics of Rakudo development as well
[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is a decent number of people who can contribute to the core
[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there have been some experienced users who could tackle something in the metamodel
[17:31] <hythm76> is it discouraged to use nqp in Raku code? and if one needs  `sha1` for example,  it is recommended to search for a module that provides sha1 functionality, instead of using nqp::sha1?
[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and then NQP and the VMs are basically only a couple of dedicated individuals...
[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> especially the VMs, of course
[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hythm76: this is kind of a controversial matter I think
[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it seems there was this vow or promise back in the day that "we won't use NQP simply for performance advantages"
[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but then it still happened, quite a lot of times, to modules like JSON::Fast
[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so at this point NQP is kind of the elephant in the room
[17:34] <hythm76> I see
[17:34] <gfldex> hythm76: If you use nqp in your code and nqp needs changing, the core devs wont listen to your complaints. If you `use v6.d;`, we guarentee that you code will keep working for the next 100 years, so long you stay in the boundaries of tests for `v6.d`. NQP is not covered by those tests.
[17:35] <hythm76> Ok makes sense
[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the same is true for the metamodel, strictly speaking
[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's just the metamodel would be even more painful to give up on, than NQP is
[17:35] <gfldex> That beeing written, nqp::sha1 is very unlikely to change in the next 10 years and it would be easy to fix in your code.
[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if use nqp is the elephant in the room than metamethods are the blue whale in the room 😄
[17:37] <gfldex> To provide a little context, Rakudo is using sha1 to provide identity to distribution/modules because we can't depends on os-level paths (because of Windows).
[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is why there is also a kind of tension between the people who draw the line at the Raku specs and the people who take Rakudo at face value, as the only thing we actually have and works
[17:38] <gfldex> If you got lots of modules installed, there is a performance burden and maybe, just maybe somebody finds an algo that is much faster. That could be a reason to replace nqp::sha1.
[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in case you are interested, not so long ago I opened a problem-solving issue about it, to at least preserve the problem: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/381
[17:41] *** wafflus left
[17:45] *** jrjsmrtn joined
[17:45] <hythm76> actually my use case for sha1 is very similar to how Rakudo uses is (caching distributions locally using their identity eg. `nqp:sha1(foo:ver<0.1>:auth<suthor>:api<>`), and it makes sense for me to use nqp::sha1 in this case, and thats is probably tthe only nqp sub I have used

[18:57] <tbrowder__> not sure if that's the right term. i used to support an ubuntu host and as i remember it was a giant pain to upgrade the major versions. not as much pain with debian.
[18:57] <tbrowder__> ubuntu may be easier now.
[18:58] <tbrowder__> haven't looked at it in about 12 yrs
[19:01] *** jpn left
[19:26] <tea3po> debian testing is rolling-release, but it's not really a release.  neither debian nor ubuntu are rolling release.  rolling release distros don't have major versions.  mint is a debian-derived rolling release distro.
[19:26] <Xliff> tbrowder__: Sorry. I'm splitting my awareness between here and $dayJob.
[19:27] <Xliff> What do you mean by "rolling release?"
[19:27] <tea3po> both debian and ime ubuntu make upgrading easy, cuz the packages are so high quality.
[19:27] <Xliff> Also, with respect to Ubuntu releases, since the latest rollover (xenial to bionic), upgrades have gotten easier.
[19:28] <tea3po> there's a strict rule though, you /must/ read the release notes before upgrading.  [and also, downgrades are difficult and unsupported]
[19:28] <Xliff> tea3po: I guess I've been lucky, then. I rarely read the release notes. I just don't have the time. :/
[19:29] <tea3po> you don't have to read everything but the important stuff will be obvious
[19:29] <Xliff> I guess I will have to start, then. Thanks for the info.
[19:29] <tea3po> you usually don't need to do anything to upgrade besides upgrade, but the thing is it's allowed for there to be "you must do/assure X before upgrading or your system WILL be broken" and they put those things in the release notes
[19:30] <Xliff> tbrowder: You shouldn't have a problem upgrading 'bionic' to anything through 'mantic', although 'mantic' isn't officially released until sometime in October of this year.
[19:30] <tea3po> this is also why you should not put names like "stable" in your sources.list
[19:31] <Xliff> Yeah. That generally means that you do an 'update' and a 'dist-upgrade' before you change the release name in sources.list
[19:31] <Xliff> So I did get that part. :)
[19:31] <tea3po> dist-upgrade is not a lot different from upgrade
[19:31] *** xinming left
[19:32] <tea3po> upgrade will still mix your system if you specify "stable" in sources.list and a new release comes up
[19:32] <tea3po> s/up/out/
[19:32] <Xliff> Ah, yeah.
[19:33] <tea3po> it's poorly named
[19:38] <tea3po> debian releases are infrequent enough that reading release notes isn't a huge burden
