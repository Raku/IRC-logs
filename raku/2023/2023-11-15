[02:28] <tonyo> yes but there's been other bugs that've been fixed

[02:28] <tellable6> 2023-11-14T19:31:10Z #raku <melezhik> tonyo I have an issue with publish distribution with zef over SparrowCI - https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/issues/117

[02:29] <tonyo> .tell melezhik `fez h` will also help know if it's getting the config from the right place.  and it's entirely possible the key you're using in SparrowCI ha expired and it's wanting you re-login

[02:29] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[14:43] * lizmat wonders why librasteve thinks Raku missed the point with concurrency support  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38276465

[15:10] <gfldex> lizmat: Raku makes a clear distinction between concurrent and serial programming.

[15:12] <lizmat> you mean: having to explicitely insert a .hyper ?

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @andinus I confirm -- the downloads are faster and (the few) GitHub actions I currently monitor worked/passed.

[15:36] <gfldex> lizmat: aye. I do believe being explicit in this area is an advantage.

[15:37] <lizmat> gfldex: why is it an advantage ?

[15:40] <gfldex> If I want to CPU to fire on all cylinders, I need to spend extra care. Even if the compiler for $language does all the magic in the background, I have to keep in mind that there might be magic. If I can I take less complexety whenever possible.

[15:46] <lizmat> if a compiler can safely determine that hypering a piece of code is possible, then it should just be a matter of (externally) specifying how many resources you want to use, no?

[16:06] <gfldex> Can the compiler know if native libs are threadsafe?

[16:11] <lizmat> if the native libs can tell the compiler in some way, yes

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: i confess that raku is the 2nd contrarian programming language I have loved ... my first was occam https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language)

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> otherwise my comment over there was an "unplug" of raku (assumptive inclusion of raku in the list of modern concurrent languages ;-))
