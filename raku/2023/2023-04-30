[08:21] <Xliff> Is there any way to get the extension of the dynamic library a given installation of Raku will use?

[08:21] <Xliff> raku -V has "moar:dll", but I don't know how to get that from -inside- raku.

[08:30] *** sena_kun joined
[08:46] *** jaguart joined
[08:48] <lizmat> Compiler.verbose-config will probably hold that info somewhere

[08:49] <lizmat> as that is what feeds -V I think

[14:43] <Xliff> Are there tools that can diagnose problems in META6.json?

[14:43] <Xliff> Are there things to look out for that would cause %?RESOURCES *not* to populate properly?

[14:43] <Xliff> Help!

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the usual turns. Are you using it in a module file?

[14:50] <Xliff> Yep. In a sub, after the unit package statement

[14:50] <Xliff> The file exists.

[14:50] <Xliff> It is in the "resources" section in META6.json

[14:51] <Xliff> Just %?RESOURCES{ $key } is empty.

[14:51] <Xliff> I just checked one of my other projects where it worked and I can't see the differences in approach.

[14:51] <lizmat> typo in key name ?

[14:52] <Xliff> Not that I can see...

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> does this -I stuff not interfere with meta6 stuff?

[15:46] <ugexe> libraries is a special directory 

[15:46] <ugexe> it automatically mangles the resource name. For instance using .DLL on windows or .so on Linux 

[15:47] *** zara left
[15:59] <ugexe> To see the extension is something like VM.platform-library-name() or some such (am on a phone)

[16:22] <Xliff> So it's the libraries directory that's causing the problem?

[16:26] <Xliff> Yep! Moving the bloody thing out of 'lib' and 'libraries' solves the problem. 

[16:26] <Xliff> Thanks everyone! (ugexe++)

[16:26] <Xliff> This should be documented. Where is the best place for such a caveat?

[16:46] <[Coke]> (TPF) From experience, I can say that if you're just voting on grants 

[16:46] <[Coke]> (more)

[16:47] *** linkable6 left
[16:47] *** evalable6 left
[16:47] <[Coke]> That the time commitment is very reasonable. Managing a grant takes some more time but not a lot.

[16:47] <[Coke]> Definitely good for the Raku community to have raku-aware people on that committee.

[23:02] <lucs> I guess it's produced by code in ⌊https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo⌉?

[23:10] <lucs> Hmm... Just cloned the repo, and grepping for 'Markdown', it appears exactly twice, in two files under ./docs :-(

[23:13] *** Manifest0 left
[23:20] <Voldenet> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Pod.pm6 is probably relevant somewhat

[23:22] <lucs> Yeah, looking at it, kind of, but no idea how it connects to the produced Markdown.

[23:22] <lucs> (if it does)

[23:24] <Voldenet> https://github.com/softmoth/raku-Pod-To-Markdown

[23:25] <lucs> Hey thanks.

[23:25] <Voldenet> by default rakudo contains only Pod::To::Text

[23:25] <Voldenet> here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/lib/Pod/To/Text.rakumod

[23:26] <lucs> How does the '--doc=Markdown' get recognized and handled?

[23:27] <Voldenet> Pod::To::(whatever you put in doc) will call render method

[23:27] <lucs> Ah, I see.

[23:27] <Voldenet> s/will call render method/will get its render method called/

[23:27] <lucs> Thanks for this.

[23:40] <tbrowder__> Xliff: if you're looking for moon phases i already have raku code for that, with help from a perl module author. i don't think it requires any libraries

[23:41] <lucs> Voldenet: Turns out --doc=Text does the same, so I'll be looking there, eh.
