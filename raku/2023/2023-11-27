[03:44] <elcaro> Who manages rakudo.org? I still cannot download the Linux release. I've also tried from a VPS in New Zealand and Japan and it also fails

[03:45] <elcaro> As mentioned previously, curl gives error `HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR`

[03:45] <elcaro> based on search results, this is possibly an issue with nginx or AWS Application Load Balancer.

[04:32] <MasterDuke> coleman or andinus are probably your best bets

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> I ended up spinning up a VPS in NY and downloading it, but as mentioned above, downloading from Australia, New Zealand, or Japan failed. I mentioned link yesterday

[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> https://rakudo.org/dl/rakudo/rakudo-moar-2023.11-01-linux-x86_64-gcc.tar.gz

[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> VPS in NY downloaded fine, so possibly only affecting APAC regions?

Nowhere it was said that the presenters can attend online. (Last year FOSDEM was mixed, with both in-person and online for presenters.)
