[00:21] <avuserow> ugexe: any potential stumbling blocks? I assume it's not as simple as replacing the `Proc::Async` usage with something like `Rakudo::Internals.precompile-this-file` and that there's some correctness or stability issue

[00:43] <avuserow> ah I see some references in past IRC conversations about concurrency bugs :|

[04:09] <hythm> melezhik: these are backspace characters (from printing progress bar) not interpreted correctly. usually when saving logs to a file or not working in a terminal I disable bar using `nobar` option. so running your command as ` pakku nobar add noprecomp notest to home .` should remove these weird characters from the CI logs.

[10:02] <melezhik> Maybe someone would volunteer? Anyways I was surprised in a good way to see Raku placeholder here - https://sqids.org/raku

[10:03] *** melezhik left
[10:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> melezhik: volunteer to what?

[10:16] <melezhik> For implementation of squids on Raku - https://sqids.org there is placeholder for Raku on the list

[10:16] <tellable6> 2023-11-26T10:06:10Z #raku <nemokosch> melezhik: volunteer to what?

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh yeah, so far it doesn't look very scary

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> how did you find stuff like this, though? Do you use it?

[13:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Did you find / see this on the sqids page?

[13:19] *** sena_kun left
[13:19] <elcaro> I believe the reason that there's a Raku placeholder is because the old version "hashids" had a Raku implementation

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Yeah, kalkin...

[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, sqids.org does not list Mathematica (or Wolfram Language) at all. So, I am deciding to be offended by that and not volunteer.

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Generally speaking, being good at justifying oneâ€™s laziness is invaluable skill.)

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I could do it, it doesn't seem too difficult

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is a TS reference implementation and a Python implementation

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also kalkin's old code

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but we parted with kalkin after some beef so probably not gonna borrow that code lol

[13:45] <Xliff> Is there a way to pause a Supply from executing .tapped events for an arbitrary period of time and then restart it again?

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch I was looking into the Python package for sqids too. Seems small enough and it has reasonable amount of tests.

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch So, if you do the Raku module/package, I will to the WL paclet.

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> interesting deal ðŸ˜„

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, you should ChatGPT-4 to the translation -- it might be a fairly quick deal.

[14:11] <Xliff> Can ChatGPT-4 generate images, yet?

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, but it is called DALL-E (provided by OpenAI.) The "front image" with raccoons and "2023.11" wood sign was generated with DALL-E3.

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> *the front image of my latest blog post "AI vision via Raku".

[14:20] <Xliff> What's the URL for DALL-E-3? I get Dall-E-2

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I think you have to be a subscriber of the ChatGPT Plus service to get access to DALL-E. (And ChatGPT-4.)

[14:22] <Xliff> I am.

[14:22] <Xliff> However, whenever I click links fir DALL-E, it always goes to DALL-E 2.

[14:22] <Xliff> Maybe I'm not spending enough? :/

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, then it should available with "https://chat.openai.com/" .

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ðŸ™‚ Agh, that is a confession!! If you were are ChatGPT Plus subscriber you would know it is with a flat rate. (Well, at least in USA.)

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, you can try DALL-E image generation with the Raku package "WWW::OpenAI". (But that is with DALL-E-1, not 3.)

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, with shell / CLI command:  openai-playground --path='images/generations' Generate an image of raccoons chasing butterflies 

[15:06] <Xliff> Not really. I have a subscription.

[15:06] <Xliff> I just always get shoved to 2 and not 3.

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I am not sure what might be the problem...
