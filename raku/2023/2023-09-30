[01:51] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> Ah okay I see

[01:52] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> I was earlier also using the <sym> token to match stuff which was causing issues

[01:52] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> But that looks great thanks a lot!

[12:49] <tbrowder__> g‚Äôday, all

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hello hello

[12:52] <tbrowder__> i started a thread over on raku-dev about renaming DISTRIBUTION.content to something more appropriate such as ‚Äú.io-handle‚Äù

[12:52] <tbrowder__> hi

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yep, seen

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it

[12:53] <tbrowder__> whadda ya tink?

[12:57] <tbrowder__> my theory is the name was chosen early on when it was going to actually provide content, and it was late in the game when it was decided the method shouldn‚Äôt provide content but too late to change the name

[12:58] <tbrowder__> kinda like some other names have been changed or aliases provided as the community grew

[12:59] <tbrowder__> anyhoo, first time i‚Äôve needed it

[12:59] <ugexe> That‚Äôs not correct 

[13:00] <ugexe> it was called content because the Dsitribution interface is for accessing addressable content. That content might not be backed by a file 

[13:00] <tbrowder__> ok

[13:04] <tbrowder__> i need to look at docs again. i think it did mention that the user needed to know how to access the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù and file handle was an example. thnx for reminder.

[13:08] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/Raku-Distribution--Common--Remote Is one example 

[13:24] <tbrowder__> thnx

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> Has there ever been projects to compile raku to native binaries? I‚Äôm not sure if the nature of the language really permits this, but it‚Äôd be great to have. I like to use raku, but others I work with don‚Äôt and so asking them to install it as a dependency can annoy them.

[14:15] <ugexe> i think someone got like "Hello, World!" working in a google summer of code years ago, but nothing more than that

[14:17] <ugexe> even then i'm not sure if it was a stand alone executable... it might have just been runnable by moarvm directly

[14:19] <ugexe> i suppose many systems have node installed. we could probably just buy out an author of a populate module for a few hundred or thousand, and hijack it to install rakudo. then in a few weeks 50% of all developers will have access to raku

[14:22] <ugexe> i look forward to the future of malware

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> shame. maybe someday ill be bored/desperate enough to look into it myself

[17:56] <tellable6> 2023-09-02T21:58:34Z #raku <guifa_> librasteve: depends on the language
