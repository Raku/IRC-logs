[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-14T12:19:05Z #raku <Xliff> Nemokosch: I know not. That's why I'm asking. :)

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-15T00:16:36Z #raku <tonyo> nemokosch: python has for else

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-16T09:23:02Z #raku <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: Yes, I think so! :) and I think Raku already has almost everything we would need in a shell.

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-17T15:03:22Z #raku <Woodi> Nemokosch: only one ? crazy :)

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-19T12:47:18Z #raku <XliffMac> Nemokosch: How so? I use the shorthand +@

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-19T20:11:40Z #raku-dev <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: but .&{} is not equivalent to .do({}). .do returns the original value, so, 42.do: { $!next = $_ + 1 }; would return 42 and store 43 on $!next…

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-20T16:42:18Z #raku <Voldenet> Nemokosch: well yes, golang is awfully simple and non-abstract, it's nice for doing things

[22:34] <tellable6> 2023-03-22T09:49:56Z #raku <exp> Nemokosch: can you show an example? I'm not aware of anything like that, but boy I haven't heard Coffeescript in a while!

[22:35] <Nemokosch> oh gosh

[22:35] <Nemokosch> xD

[22:36] <Nemokosch> so yeah... I think that snippet actually DOES make sense. It follows the principles of smartmatching. Both regarding implementation (14 is being bound to the $_ of the RHS), and in its higher-level reading (14 can definitely be taken as a value defined by the x * 1 formula)

[22:37] <Nemokosch> m: $_ = 12; say 14 ~~ $_;

[22:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar e5e5acb41: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[22:37] <Nemokosch> This, on the other hand, is not okay.

[22:39] <Nemokosch> Somebody, probably in the spirit of "do what I mean", created a corner case with no theoretical foundation, something you absolutely cannot anticipate.

[22:41] <Nemokosch> As I hope this is simply a benevolent mistake living outside of the language design, I'm going to open a Rakudo issue for this.

[23:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> actually, even 14 ~~ ($_) works

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> now I'm especially not sure if this isn't just a mere bug...
