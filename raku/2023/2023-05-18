[17:14] <Xliff_> What'

[17:15] <Xliff_> What's the best way to do multi-key sorting in Raku?

[17:20] *** TieUpYourCamel left
[17:23] <Voldenet> just sort by them both

[17:23] <Voldenet> m: my $x = [{ :a(1) :b(2) }, { :a(1) :b(1) }, { :a(1) :b(-1) }, { :a(-1) :b(2) }]; say $x.sort(*<b>).sort(*<a>)

[17:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar b881fe847: OUTPUT: «({a => -1, b => 2} {a => 1, b => -1} {a => 1, b => 1} {a => 1, b => 2})␤»

[17:23] <Voldenet> iirc sort is stable

[17:25] <Voldenet> just sort by attributes in reversed order, so `order by a, b` becomes `.sort(*<b>).sort(*<a>)`

[17:33] <Xliff_> Or you can just use a list. :)

[17:33] <Xliff_> Voldenet++

[17:33] *** TieUpYourCamel joined

[17:34] <tonyo> isn't that ordering by just a?

[17:35] <tonyo> b=2,1,1,2, a=-1,1,1,1 doesn't look like it's order by b, a

[17:38] <tonyo> m: my $x = [{ :a(1) :b(2) }, { :a(1) :b(1) }, { :a(1) :b(-1) }, { :a(-1):b(2) }]; say $x.sort({ $^a<a> cmp $^b<a> ~~ Same ?? $^a<b> cmp $^a<b> !! $^a<a> cmp $b<a>});

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar b881fe847: OUTPUT: «({a => -1, b => 2} {a => 1, b => 2} {a => 1, b => 1} {a => 1, b => -1})␤»

[17:52] *** andydude left
[17:56] <Voldenet> oh, using a list works too

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - I thought that

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there has to be a better way than this ?!

[17:57] <Voldenet> m: my $x = [{ :a(1) :b(2) }, { :a(1) :b(1) }, { :a(1) :b(-1) }, { :a(-1) :b(2) }]; say $x.sort(*<a b>)
