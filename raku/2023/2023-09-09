[10:59] <tbrowder__> well, some raku core person made my day! looking at the docs trying to see current state of "copy" i see file ".extension" is now in core, hooray!

[11:00] <tbrowder__> i must have missed the announcement

[11:01] <lizmat> yeah, there are some good people working behind the scenes :-)

[11:01] <tbrowder__> i was going to guess it was you, liz

[11:02] <tbrowder__> how about copy, then

[11:02] <tbrowder__> copy /a/b, /b => /b/b

[11:03] <tbrowder__> it would be a chore to do full *nix semantics, but the simple case maybe...

[11:06] <tbrowder__> for myself, that is the most-used, and a pain with current method. i tried working on a File::Copy years ago to argue for that but i got lost in the weeds

[11:08] <tbrowder__> i may revisit the module and make it lighter...

[11:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it was probably liz

[11:23] <tbrowder__> looking at File::Copy. it was removed from CPAN.

[11:23] <tbrowder__> and marked with a danger warning

[11:24] <tbrowder__> ;-(

[11:25] <lizmat> there's BackPAN I think?

[11:47] <tbrowder__> oh i still have the code. iâ€™ll see if i can reduce the warning and put it Zef

[11:47] <tbrowder__> maybe back off to the simple sub / simple case

[11:49] <tbrowder__> itâ€™s in my github at File-Copy

[12:07] <opoku> hello, i'm having trouble evaluating a heredoc inside of an emacs Raku REPL buffer. Pasting the same here doc in a Raku REPL in a terminal works fine. Gist showing error here: https://gist.github.com/opoku/626a0a49ee542bc74882961de2748851

[12:09] <lizmat> heredocs in the REPL are currently not supprted afaik

[12:09] <lizmat> sorry

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder what you did that it worked fine in a Raku REPL in a terminal ðŸ˜„

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> never managed to use it

[12:21] <opoku> i just copied the text and pasted into a repl running in my terminal

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> didn't work for me

[14:49] <tbrowder__> fyi, i'm getting successful windows testing (without prove6)/with a bash script and raku -I. iterating over the test files in t/

[15:08] <tbrowder__> for f in t/* ; do raku -I. $f ; done

[15:09] <tbrowder__> put in yr windows.yml for github actions

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder So, you have a windows machine to experiment with Raku packages?

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder If you answer yes, I am going to ask you to figure out or test the copying to the OS clipboard  with Raku. ðŸ™‚ (Using the package "Clipboard" : https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Clipboard .)

[15:44] <tbrowder__> no, not yet, but i rely on github's test vm

[15:46] <tbrowder__> one thing i do is separate github workflows testing so the badges show green or red for each os and it's easier to work each os separately.

[15:47] <tbrowder__> if you use my Mi6::Helper you can see with a new Foo module how that is done and mimic it.

[15:49] <tbrowder__> i'll take a look, though, i also now, thanks to [Coke] look at Chocalatey for windows packages that may need to be added

[19:40] <guifa> making a local alpha token was surprisingly easier than I thought 

[19:41] <guifa> with RakuAST I mean

[19:41] <guifa> (actually, it's much easier than doing it with EVAL by probably an order of magnitude lol)

[19:49] <guifa> Only reason I haven't released it yet is I found a bug in Intl::CLDR and decided a part could use some better architecture to enable exactly what I'm trying to do better hahaha

[19:51] <guifa> (CLDR abbreviates the alphabet for languages with ranges.  i was expanding them.  cool for English et al.  Japanese and Chinese have some very large ones and expanding is wasteful since regex will compress them back into a range definition)

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ðŸ¤”

[20:05] <tbrowder__> btw, i forgot bash is not on windows, so i just add one exe line for each test file, something in the win.yml like: run | raku -I. t/test1.t \n raku -I t/test2.t ...

[20:07] <tbrowder__> name each test file explicitly, one per line followin the "run |"

[20:12] <tbrowder__> you can see it in action on the community modules repo with my PR for File::Find

[20:12] <tbrowder__> good test on windows!

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, you fixed it... but at what cost. Using a more than a year old Rakudo

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> isn't it simply true?

[20:55] <tbrowder__> the vm is using rakudo-latest

[20:55] <tbrowder__> and so am i

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I thought we were talking about this: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/File-Find/pull/43/files#diff-2ae24a41be66dcfede7dd5ce3766ff5655b09b0df2b3adfdce50cdae63030167

[21:02] <tbrowder__> oh, you're right--forgot to change that part. doing that now

[21:03] *** NemokoschKiwi joined
[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh, so that wasn't it

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oops

[21:06] *** NemokoschKiwi left
[21:08] <tbrowder__> thnx, corrected, fingers crossed

[21:10] <tbrowder__> and tests ok

[21:11] <tbrowder__> it doesn't solve the prove6 problem, but it's a valid alternative imho

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> nice ^^

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> On a different note: I would be thankful if somebody could explain to me what the point of a "test harness" even is

[21:22] <tbrowder__> now if someone can provide a powershell equiv to the bash thing. a short raku prog or one-liner should do it...

[21:25] <ugexe> zef will test like that if you invoke it with --/prove --/tap-harness

[21:25] <ugexe> i.e. run `raku -I. -Iother-depends t/my-test1.t`, `raku -I. -Iother-depends t/my-test2.t`, etc

[21:26] <ugexe> one thing a harness does is aggregate 

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so it could be changed to zef test --/prove --/tap-harness . ?
