[05:20] <guifa> When doing a Num.Str and Num.base(10) with fractional components, I fair a bit better.  40x slower than .Str, and 3x slower than base(10)

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you know Raku libraries for simple image generation? (a matrix of letters)

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I only found an imlib2 wrapper

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that does seem to work but maybe somebody knows something else

[13:00] <moritz> there's an SVG library that you could use (and then pipe through a renderer, if you need a bitmap in the end)

[13:03] <moritz> guifa: maybe .floor is not the best rounding for floating-pint numbers

[13:03] <guifa> moritz: I'm testing out to see if I can do a dumb log10 function that can nearly match on speed

[13:05] <guifa> I just need an integer value for magnitude, where 123 | 100 | 999 == 3, and and 0.01 | 0.012 | 0.099 == -2; but 0 == 1

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> moritz: thank you, this is worth considering; perhaps I need a bitmap at the end of the day, and it would be good to observe it in a blocking way

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> obtain, rather

[13:28] <guifa> moritz: this is what I've come up with 

[13:28] <guifa> https://gist.github.com/alabamenhu/e0770fc0b978d579eeb2315adb429a03

[13:30] <guifa> it seems to be hovering about 70% slower than a $n == 0 ?? 1 !! $n.log10.[floor|ceiling], which I guess isn't a terrible sacrifice for perfect precision, give it'll only be called once per function

[18:01] <guifa> format 12.345 -> '12.3'

[18:01] <guifa> format 123.45 -> '123.' or '123' ?

[18:02] <guifa> or do you do the dot just when it ends in a significant zero or is that overkill?

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Interesting question. Normally I would say number-form(123.45, :3n) should give 123.  (i.e. with a dot.)

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa But I know that Raku complains when numbers finish with "." when parsing various types of inputs. (CSV, Raku, etc.)

[20:43] <Xliff> I have working Raku bindings for much of LibAdwaita now.

[20:43] <Xliff> https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/index.html

[20:44] <lizmat> Cool!

[20:44] <Xliff> Working through the bugs with the demos.

[20:44] <Xliff> There are... quite a few.

[20:48] <guifa> how much does Raku break if you set $*TOLERANCE to 0 ?

[20:48] <guifa> (or does it not at all?)

[20:53] <lizmat> it might break some programs assuming some floating point values are (not) equal ?

[20:53] <lizmat> I don't think Raku itself will suffer ?

[20:56] <guifa> hrmph.  I was hoping the answer would be "it all breaks" so I can make some assumptions haha

[20:57] <guifa> I've found a slightly faster way for formatting digits.  The problem is, I need to know the total number of digits to format.  Easy enough when the flag for maximum-fractional-digits is anything other than infinity

[20:58] <guifa> I was thinking maybe to cut back infinity to however far back $*TOLERANCE goes and multiplying accordingly, but if $*TOLERANCE Is 0, will error out somewhere

[22:06] <rf> Hmm, I think I'm going to try to make a tradition out of writing Raku blog posts on Sunday

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, you could check on us on the Raku Study Group SF zoom meetups, one is taking place right now, usually it starts every second sunday 1pm pacific time

[23:18] *** jpn left
[23:30] <rf> Is it on zoom?

[23:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes

[23:32] <rf> Oh, lol missed the "zoom" in your message

[23:32] <rf> I can attend next one, I have to leave in about 5 minutes

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay okay. The next one will be in three weeks accidentally, Joe Brenner (doomvox) will be away

[23:34] <rf> Sounds good!

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is the repo with the notes https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study Perl also often comes up because there are some traditionally Perl folks

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this time I got to see XS code, well... I won't miss it. NQP is Shakespeare compared to it üòÑ

[23:48] <Voldenet> inline C was pretty nice, fast and all that
