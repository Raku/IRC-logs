[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> is there a way to stream a file handle with a Channel rather than a supply?

[00:30] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> i suppose i can funnel the Supply into a channel

[00:31] *** ab5tract left
[00:38] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> is there a way for me to manually discard data I'm no longer using from a handle? I'm streaming a very large file, but even when I'm done with part of it, raku keeps it in memory

[00:41] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> oh duh, it's cause im printing stuff to console :)

[01:22] <defaultxr> hi. is it just me or is the documentation for \ not working? i get a 404 when i try to access https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%5C

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> are you sure that's a good URL? unfortunately, archive.org also has nothing for it

[01:29] *** razetime joined
[01:29] <defaultxr> it is the page that is linked when i enter \ into the docs.raku.org search bar and press enter

[01:29] <defaultxr> so i assume it is supposed to be the correct link

[01:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd open an issue on the doc site

[01:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues

[01:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I found similar funny links to . in the search

[01:32] <defaultxr> thanks, i wasn't sure if this was the right place to report. i'll open an issue there.

[11:02] <jjatria> Browsing the documentation I stumbled across 'will', which I didn't know. But I cannot find it in the docs. Can someone point me to where that is documented?

[11:02] <jjatria> m: my $x will leave { say "left" } = "foo"; say $x

[11:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar c509e758b: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§left‚ê§¬ª

[11:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> how did you come across will in the documentation if it's not documented? üòÑ

[11:17] <jjatria> lol

[11:17] <jjatria> It was in one of the exmpales

[11:18] <jjatria> https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Handle#Examples

[11:20] <jjatria> Ah, I found it. It's mentioned in https://docs.raku.org/language/phasers

[11:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is not easy to find...

[11:22] <jjatria> > Some of these phasers also have corresponding traits that can be set on variables; they use will followed by the name of the phaser in lowercase.

[11:23] <jjatria> The "some of the phasers" bit I guess could be more specific

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ maybe we should request that both 'will' and the set of relevant lowercase phasers be added to the raku doc search index and pretty much all ppoint to the  "Some of these phasers" section?

[12:35] <amano> Why can I not close a supply tap in a whenever block?

[12:35] <amano> When I do that, I get "Can only cancel an AsyncTask handle".

[12:35] <amano> What is AsyncTask?

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think you'll need a concentrated effort with people who actually know things like this...

[12:37] <melezhik> o/

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you might even visit #moarvm

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> simply because the chances of finding somebody who is knowledgeable with this stuff is higher probably

[12:39] <melezhik> if someone is willing to share some spare resources (VMs) / and / or ¬†donate to sparrow ci , please let me know, I anticipate cutting my budget a bit, which might affect https://ci.sparrowhub.io hosting, but I would not like to shut the service down , ¬†ü§î

[12:40] <amano> Okay

[12:40] <melezhik> right now this is 32 GB memory VM, which might be a bit smaller if we talk about running ci.sparrowhub.io only

[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I agree and use SO when I have a longer question- it is great for having a more Q&A oriented format than a chat room and we are making tracks to help others when they hit the same issue

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4348

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ I made a raku doc issue for the 'will' operator
