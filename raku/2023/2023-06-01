[02:08] <frost33> So, now the "RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1" is not needed?

[02:15] <guifa_> frost: no

[02:15] <guifa_> the RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 is for having Rakudo's compiler et al using RakuAST as well

[02:16] <guifa_> the RakuAST classes are enabled with the `use experimental` statemen

[08:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I agree that .list is all you need for the [+] dss reduction

[08:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but I also want Numeric to yield data.elems for sums like dss + 1

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay but I'd imagine that's not needed for [+] dss to work, right?

[09:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yep - list is all you need

[09:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> for that

[09:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> further to that, I couldn;t figure why the resolved gist worked, but my code didn't ... I was using my \dss = $; then dss = x, dss = y, to save typing my all the time (durr)

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> after some tinkering (i) it is important that you do not use the my \dss = $; idiom since you need the container to not be a Scalar and (ii) the container role / class needs to do Iterable (but not Positional)

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://gist.github.com/librasteve/df48c92a3f91e061e5dd81a1871ae1eb is a new gist with that to play with

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for all the guidance

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ which reinforces my opinion that it is pretty stupid to use any variable outside of $, @, %, & unless you are sure you know what you are doing

[13:57] <[Coke]> (btw, my moarvm internal error was easily solved by adding a Lock.protect around the code touching the hash. This is the sort of thing where it might be nice to have some kind of doc for "hey, did you get this error (whether a standard exception or some weird internal panic) - then do this."

[13:58] <[Coke]> annoyingly, I had already had a my $lock = Lock.new before the race... and no protect call where it needed to be. didn't check git history, but weird.

[15:37] <uzl[m]> .tell tonyo For this module, does adding Rakudoc/Pod6 to the module itself and then generating the README from it add any value to the module?

[15:37] <uzl[m]> https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/CSV::Parser

[15:37] <tellable6> uzl[m], I'll pass your message to tonyo

[15:39] <uzl[m]> Kind of a low hanging fruit but I think the community should start an effort to rename modules and whatnot to reflect the renaming, which is mostly extensions I'd assume 🙂

[15:40] *** codesections1 joined
[15:43] <[Coke]> as someone who works with docs, I understand the theoretical benefit of eating our own dogfood (writing docs in rakudoc) rather than having the source in markdown... but I am so used to markdown it feels like extra work.

[15:44] <uzl[m]> <tbrowder__> "where/when is the raku core conf..." <- I didn't see an answer so resurfacing tbrowder's question :)

[15:44] <[Coke]> benefit comes when we install the docs and can use something like rakudoc to read them, but I don't know how common that is yet.

[15:45] <dakkar> [Coke]: I feel it's a bit of a bootstrapping problem ☺

[15:45] <uzl[m]> >but I am so used to markdown it feels like extra work.

[15:45] <uzl[m]> No, I think this is fair but it's hard to encourage newcomers to use something when even community members don't use it haha

[15:45] <uzl[m]>  * > but I am so used to markdown it feels like extra work.

[15:45] <uzl[m]> No, I think this is fair but it's hard to encourage newcomers to use something when even community members don't use it haha

[15:46] <dakkar> rakudoc (which, IIRC, it's not part of the base rakudo distribution) is less useful/used because there's not much installed documentation

[15:46] <uzl[m]> For me, it's an extra step 

[15:46] <dakkar> and there's not much installed documentation because "nobody uses rakudoc"

[15:46] <dakkar> (that's my feeling, at least)

[15:46] <uzl[m]> Btw there's Podlite (https://github.com/podlite/podlite-web) for rendering Pod which I haven't tried yet

[15:47] <uzl[m]> A catch-22 type of situation lol

[15:47] <dakkar> re: podlite, I find it funny that it's written in javascript, not raku

[15:48] <uzl[m]> One day!!! 

[15:48] <dakkar> (ok, typescript, but still)

[15:49] <uzl[m]> [Coke]: Whenever you get the chance, do you mind looking at https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4315? I also left some comments to close some issues that I think were addressed already :)

[15:50] <uzl[m]> Ok back to work... until later

[15:59] <lizmat> fwiw, App::Mi6 automatically creates a README from the rakudoc of the main file

[15:59] <lizmat> it's not extra work for me

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> uzl[m] thank you very much, I raised similar concerns a while ago, it's not that we are helicopters probably

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you just cannot make people care

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> presenting a consistent picture, e.g using consistent extensions, would really ONLY be a matter of discipline

[16:16] <dakkar> should we re-invent kwalitee? it mostly worked for cpan…

[16:17] <dakkar> (a distribution gets points for things like correct naming, tests, readme, changelog, &c; publish a leaderboard; gamify the whole thing)

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for podlite: I think there is a positive way to look at it

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 1. it doesn't depend on, well let me be straight about it, the chaos revolving around Raku at all; it's an independent implementation, much like one could wish for Raku itself

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 2. it shows that somebody can be interested in this piece of technology without being in the "Raku camp"

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 3. in theory, being a "mundane" TS project could attract futher outsiders, the entry barrier is lower on average, see "why MoarVM is written in C"

[16:31] <jdv> the renaming stuff will always be fraught.  kwalitee may nudge some but i'm not sure its worth it unless you really want to do it:)

[16:33] <jdv> i'd be interested how important doc formats are to most people

[16:34] <jdv> at least as far as why they do or don't like/use raku

[16:34] <jdv> for me, its still performance - that's why i shy away from raku a lot of the time

[21:09] <tonyo> librasteve: new username and migrate is the right way so dists don't need to be modified/downstream users remain unaffected

[21:10] <tonyo> a nice option too is to release another intermediate version letting people know to migrate

[21:10] *** zara left
[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cool - many thanks!

[21:17] <timo> matching changed user names seems like a thing a Recommendation Manager would want to do

[21:31] *** derpydoo left
[21:40] <tonyo> it doesn't seem trivial to do.  if librasteve changes to xyz and tony-o changes to librasteve then there's a resulting mess that requires a lot of other information to resolve.  dates the names changed, dates dists were published, and all username changes between _any user_ with any of the usernames

[21:41] <tonyo> using the groups mechanism seems like an alternative, then you maintain the user/group relationship

[21:42] <tonyo> and you can publish with the name

[21:43] <tonyo> s/(name)/group $1
