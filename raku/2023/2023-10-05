[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Is there a method I can use to simply discard its invocant? (I have a long complicated multiline ".say" that I want to "comment out" during development.)

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> (temporarily replacing the 'say' with 'discard' or something would be easier than commenting out a bunch of lines)

[17:15] <lizmat> .sink

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Awright! Thanks 🙂

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I'd browsed the docs for classes Mu and Any and hadn't found anything. What is the inferred type of the invocant when I use "some string".sink?

[17:23] <lizmat> m: say 42.^find_method("sink").signatur

[17:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 66be950f6: OUTPUT: «No such method 'signatur' for invocant of type 'Method'.  Did you mean␤'signature'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:23] <lizmat> m: say 42.^find_method("sink").signature

[17:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 66be950f6: OUTPUT: «(Mu: *%_ --> Nil)␤»

[17:24] <lizmat> scullucs so it looks like Mu:

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Does that mean that maybe the 'class Mu' doc page is missing mentioning that method? (it appears not to be there)

[17:27] *** ab5tract left
[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Also: thanks for the info about find_method.

[17:28] <lizmat> sink is really an internal method

[17:29] <lizmat> if is conceptually the method that gets called on any value in a statement if it its not returned

[17:30] <lizmat> s/in/of/

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Ah I see, thanks

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> takes notes

[17:30] <lizmat> m: 42

[17:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 66be950f6: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of constant integer 42 in sink context (line 1)␤»
