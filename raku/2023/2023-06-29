[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Coke Yeah, after I posted my question, it occurred to me that I have seen "Grammar::Tracer" and Comma's "live grammars". I used "Grammar::Tracer" ≈ an year. ago.

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I was thinking more about graph representations of grammars. Something like this : https://wiki.c2.com/?BnfToDot . I am not sure how useful it is. Seems neat for small grammars.

[18:31] <Tirifto> Since work on v6.e is apparently underway, are any Unicode additions being planned or considered? :o I recall reading this page at one point, but it has not changed in a while: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/save-me-from-ASCII

[18:32] <lizmat> Tirifto: hasn't been touched in almost 4 years

[18:34] *** bigdata left
[18:36] <lizmat> Updated so that at least the name is ok

[18:36] <Tirifto> A lot from that page reads like a brainstorm, but some symbols, like ‘⌁’, ‘⟅⟆’, or ‘∑’, seem to fit the outlined requirements very well. Do they need more discussion/evaluation, or is it just that someone has to make a pull request implementing them (possibly leading to further discussion there), and no one’s done that so far?

[18:37] <lizmat> fwiw I think it fell through the cracks of the turmoil with the name change

[18:37] <lizmat> *I* had completely forgotten about it

[18:40] <Tirifto> I probably remembered since the use of Unicode symbols might be my favourite thing about Raku. x)

[18:46] <Tirifto> So if I’d like to see these in Raku, would sending a patch be a good way to start? :o

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @tonyo Very interesting! Is your visualization "targeting" GraphViz / DOT?

[18:47] *** Anant left
[18:47] <Tirifto> Or should some discussion precede each of these first?

[18:50] <lizmat> I'm looking at them now, and preparing new PRs for the Raku Grammar (aka RakuAST)

[19:35] <lizmat> Tirifto: that'll be all I think, although I'm thinking about how to work out 1⅐ 

[19:36] <lizmat> and seeing the difference between ⅐ an 

[19:36] <lizmat> and ⁹

[19:50] <Tirifto> Ahh, I hadn’t noticed the fractions were already supported.

[19:52] *** bigdata joined
[19:52] *** bigdata left
[19:54] <Tirifto> There’s also a fraction slash, which in writing should be used in conjunction with superscript and subscript numbers, I think. [citation needed] So you get ¹⁄₂, ⁶⁄₇, ¹¹⁄₂₃, and so on. Raku doesn’t seem to support those, though, and the ASCII page only mentions it as a possible operator.

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Tirifto So, we can use two waves?  ↝↝

[21:43] <Tirifto> @Anton Antonov, wouldn’t a single one suffice? :o

[21:45] <lizmat> I think we should be very careful with adding unicode ops that could also be added in module space

[21:46] <lizmat> m: constant &infix:<↝> = &infix:<~~>; say "foo" ↝ / o /

[21:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «｢o｣␤»

[21:48] <lizmat> also: almost there:

[21:48] <lizmat> m: say ¹/₂

[21:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «0.5␤»

[21:48] <lizmat> m: say ¹¹/₂

[21:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «0.5␤»

[21:48] <lizmat> guess that needs a little work

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Tirifto "wouldn’t a single one suffice? :o" -- I don't know. Some people do prefer using "%%" instead of "%" when defining list-of-things regexes. (By analogy, same with "↝" ...)

[21:48] <lizmat> m: say ¹

[21:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[21:49] <lizmat> m: say ¹¹

[21:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[21:51] <Voldenet> having unicode inside files is a code smell

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Is this expected to work: √¹¹/₂ ?

[21:52] <lizmat> not at the moment

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> 😭

[21:53] <lizmat> m: sub prefix:<√>($a) { sqrt $a }; say √16

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «4␤»

[21:53] <Voldenet> m: sub prefix:<√>($a) { sqrt $a }; say √11/2

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «1.6583123951777␤»

[21:53] <Voldenet> that's close enough ;)

[21:54] <Tirifto> @Anton Antonov, oh, you meant a double variant in addition to the single one? Then I suppose so, but I’m not sure what it might be used for. :o

[21:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, we have to define also ''∛" and "∜"...

[21:56] <Voldenet> m: say sqrt 11/2

[21:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «2.345207879911715␤»

[21:56] <Voldenet> ngl, sqrt is more readable and works

[21:57] <Tirifto> lizmat, how does one identify operators likely to be used in module space? Isn’t that mostly unpredictable? I can see symbols with established meaning used because they have an established meaning, and symbols without it used because they don’t (so they can work for whatever).

[21:57] <Voldenet> re ∛, it'd be difficult to explain difference between √ and that

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet Agreed. (But I am spoiled from using Mathematica too much...)

[21:58] <lizmat> anything that's an prefix, infix, postfix, postcircumfix and even circumfix, can be added

[21:58] <lizmat> ->  =>  <-> are more syntaxy things

[22:00] <Voldenet> (sqrt returns one number, roots(*, 3) returns complex numbers)

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet Thanks! (I was wondering does something like roots  exist in Raku...)

[22:03] <Voldenet> It does and in fact it has quite confusing relation to sqrt

[22:03] <Voldenet> m: say sqrt(9), roots(9, 2)

[22:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2e53c8723: OUTPUT: «3(3+0i -3+3.6739403974420594e-16i)␤»

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet 🙂 You start to sound like @nemokosch ...

[22:04] <Voldenet>  :D

[22:05] <Voldenet> I remember answering that question about roots here, so it's not that synthetical problem though

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet It is good to know. When I get back to my Mathematica-to-Raku translator I will use roots.

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> How does Raku finds suggestions for misspellings during compile / run time? Is "Text::Diff::Sift4" used?

[22:07] <lizmat> I think StrDistance is used

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 3+0i and -3+3.6739403974420594e-16i sum to 0, right?

[22:09] <Voldenet> no, they sum to 0+3.6739403974420594e-16i

[22:09] <Voldenet> the answer as misleading as technically correct

[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Where the dead links of docs.raku.org are supposed to be reported?

[22:51] <Voldenet> perhaps https://github.com/Raku/doc

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> dead link here in https://docs.raku.org/type/StrDistance.html -- "string transformation",  https://docs.raku.org/syntax/tr$SOLIDUS$SOLIDUS$SOLIDUS

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet -- Yeah, sure.

[22:52] <Voldenet> btw, on the topic of roots, maybe tau constant could be used here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Complex.pm6#L141

[22:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> 🤔

[22:55] <Voldenet> in fact maybe doing division before sum would increase precision

[22:55] <Voldenet> not by much

[22:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> why are there still $SOLIDUS URL's...

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, I think it's bizarre that the positive root is accurate while the negative root which should really be the positive root times -1, is inaccurate

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it would actually make more logical sense if both had some representational error
