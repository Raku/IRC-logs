[10:29] <CIAvash> Is the rakudo binary tarballs being signed with a new pgp key? I'm getting "unknown public key A67D866449628CF9"

[13:19] <patrickb> CIAvash: My signing keys expired 6 days or so ago and I didn't notice. gpg fell back to a different key and used that for signing, thus the different key.

[13:19] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to CIAvash

[13:20] <patrickb> CIAvash: I guess it's better to remove the bad signings than leaving them out there. I pinged jdv (he's doing the source release and signs that), maybe he can sign the files.

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract How many LLMs did you try today?

[15:07] <ab5tract> having fun with `Raylib::Bindings`?

[15:08] <ab5tract> antononcube: got quite a lot going on at the moment, so none

[15:08] <Xliff_> Actually.... yeah! :)

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Ok. How many LLMs did you try this week?

[15:09] <ab5tract> 1 - Cody

[15:10] <ab5tract> I haven't had time to get the Raku module set up, and probably won't before the 26th :/

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ha! I heard about that ‚âà2 months ago at the Wolfram Technology Conference.

[15:11] <ab5tract> it's autocomplete has been right like 5% of the time :)

[15:11] <ab5tract> it's better in Java, like 20%

[15:11] <ab5tract> that's with the Enterprise edition through work

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat My last Raku Advent Calendar article is ready to go. (I proofread it twice; both time important corrections were made.)

[17:15] <CIAvash> patrickb: Thanks for clarifying, that would be great, since jdv is listed on the "Verifying" page as well (https://rakudo.org/downloads/verifying)

[17:38] <melezhik> o/

[17:39] <melezhik> I am resuming my Alpine repository for Raku modules - https://github.com/melezhik/raku-alpine-repo/tree/main - if someone is into Alpine/Raku distribution please let me know

[17:40] <melezhik> currently this is only for ARM arch and has only few Raku modules in the listing - https://alpine.sparrowhub.io/aarch64/ , eventually I will add more

[17:41] <melezhik> this is how one can contribute by adding new modules - https://github.com/melezhik/raku-alpine-repo/tree/main#package-apkbuild-files

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ crag now does Chemistry

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Ah, great! Any ideas how to specify equation balancing?

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve When I try to install "App::Crag" I get this error:  [Physics::Measure] # Failed test '$fe2.in-km/l' [Physics::Measure] # at t/05-cvt.rakutest line 173 [Physics::Measure] # expected: '10.620186km/l' [Physics::Measure] #      got: '12.754311km/l' [Physics::Measure] # You failed 1 test of 52 

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  ~ > crag "say balance-chemical-equation('C2H5OH + O2 = H2O + CO2');" [1*C2H5OH + 3*O2 -> 2*CO2 + 3*H2O] 

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume I can just force-test "Physics::Measure"?

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ works fine

[17:55] *** jpn left
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I think you may have an older version of Physics::Unit - suggest zef uninstall Physics::Measure Physics::Unit and then zef insall App::Crag (latest just pushed to fez is v0.0.15)

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (otherwise, yes just --force-test)

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, doing that now.

[17:58] *** MasterDuke joined
[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve It looks like it is just that one test -- and it is still failing after uninstall / reinstall.

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - i'll go in check in a couple of minutes - tx! (does force test work in the meantime?)

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes it does.

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is an example with LLM normalization:

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1188183850279506111/as-crag-by-LLM-function.png?ex=65999971&is=65872471&hm=65c38cefd26e269259f5a9aecfcdb186c38948e89604930835436cadb86b91e0&

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is how I defined the LLM normalization prompt:  my $crag-prompt = q:to/END/; You are a great translator of natural language specifications into Raku code for doing Physics and Chemistry related computations. You are also very good at translating generic psedo code into correct Raku code for doing Physics and Chemistry related computations.  For example, you know that this pseudo code specification:  ```` crag

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> 'h=450, w=1520, d=2315, v=h*w*d; print "{v} cu mm"' ````  translates into:  ```` my $h=450; my $w=1520; my $d=2315; my $v=h*w*d; say "{v} cu mm"; ````  END
