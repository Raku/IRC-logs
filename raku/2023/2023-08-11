[00:23] <ugexe> anthk_: zef v0.18.3 (just released) should be able to correctly use tar on openbsd. although i'm not sure that is what your problem is (you posted a Memory allocation error, but not the entire output from zef using --debug that contains that line)

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder what it would take to pull glot.io to the latest Rakudo

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Somehow there is a docker container and a nix package

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> However, there is an up-to-date Nix package for Rakudo

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> And probably an up-to-date Docker container as well, for what it's worth...

[12:04] <drakonis> well

[12:04] <drakonis> replit uses nix for it as opposed to generating docker images

[12:05] <drakonis> also better maintained

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> replit is not practical for the same purpose. The Discord bot uses the glot.io executor for producing output

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> replit is rather bulky if all you ever wanted was to run a little piece of code

[13:11] <kybr> the extraction seems to happen, but it's half-baked. i downloaded and extracted the .zip for moar-2023.02 and it seems fine. I copied it into \rakubrew\versions\...moar-2022.06/... but a `rakubrew switch moar-2023.02` gives "Version moar-2023.02 is broken. Refusing to switch."

[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> bisectable might help

[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you give an example, maybe I can help, too

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx!

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for @.dims.clone, nothing related for at least a year

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> MixHash has had a commit in february but it shouldn't change clone

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for Array.clone, actually, the implementation didn't change but it's kind of complex

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> sorry, if you need something specific, you will probably need to invoke bisectable. I see no commits that even touched that kind of code for at least half a year

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - that pretty much rules that out then... appreciate the help!

[16:52] <tonyo> librasteve: what're you trying to figure?

[19:03] <tbrowder__> actually i found the base windows image does come with strawberryperl installed, and it does include cpanm.

[19:03] <tbrowder__> so i have made some progress.

[19:10] <tbrowder__> at last check the windows cpan load line now works. the error now is with zef installing a raku module that can’t work with windows.

[20:00] <jgaz> Theoretically, is it possible to use built-in language features to extend existing operators? Example: `!(<)` returns a Bool but could I extend it to accept a `:k` and get the Int of an offset given `@small !(<) :k @large`?

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jgaz: yes definitely - you will need something like this (think of the built in as multi already)...

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> multi infix:<\<> ( $left, $right, :$k) is export { ... }

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ discord has dropped the '&'

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and then you need to follow the guidance here https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Multi-dispatch to make sure that your signature is distinctive

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder if that's really where the adverb would go in the syntax

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's a bit funny, I can imagine it would have to go after the second argument

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is also another challenge: !(<) is a deduced operator. Not sure if you can overload something like that

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thinking of m:g/.../ probably it needs to huddle the actual operator

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and if you cannot, the ! meta-operator might remove whatever you added for the base operator (<)

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe @small !(<:k)  @large

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> although you know, !(<) can probably be rephrased as (>=) 😛

[20:11] <jgaz> Thanks! Raku is complicated but I love its expressivity. I'm just trying to experement.

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> close, but no cigar

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> maybe because it has chaining associativity?

[20:29] <jgaz> I see I'm not the only person scratching their head about this. :)

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> operator adverbs didn't turn out to be that useful, outside of a few special situations

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> you could mixin a role to one or both args and then use the arg type to distinguish the multi

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: role K {}; multi infix:('>=') (K $l, $r) { 'yo' }; my $a = 3 but K; say $a >= 2;

[21:11] <SmokeMachine> There are new features on RakuCron (https://github.com/FCO/RakuCron/blob/main/examples/1.rakuconfig). I'm thinking next start logging some stuff there. Does, any one, have any suggestion for a good module for logging? Or is it better to do that by hand? I'm thinking on using https://raku.land/zef:jonathanstowe/Lumberjack, opinions?

[21:34] *** teatwo left
[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Do it by hand! (Which, I assume,means “make a module.”)

[21:46] *** buffet joined
[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well, if there is a good enough alternative? I don't know much about Lumberjack though

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> But it seems to me that we keep building essentially the same things over and over. There are at least 3 individual branches of GTK bindings, several leftover HTTP server/client libraries, loads of old templating engines and/or HTML generators...

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> SQL generators as well

[22:02] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: no, I meant just use &say and open files...

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see. Also, my suggestion/ issue for “RakuCron” is not that serious….

[22:04] <SmokeMachine> nemokosch: me neither, but I like what I see... it seems to be some some dispatchers/plugins... https://raku.land/?q=Lumberjack

[22:06] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: I disagree, I think that's very important! but I didn't like the generated documentation... so I was trying to regenerate it with no success...

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ah. It is just a jump-start. Some human interaction is most likely always needed.

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hm, what generated documentation?

[22:10] <SmokeMachine> nemokosch : https://github.com/FCO/RakuCron/issues/1

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 😂

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i think we need a process to sunset modules and/or to detect if there is an active author

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's a good idea, and probably in accordance with the raku-community-modules account

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - the community can decide to adopt stuff that has ongoing value

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm trying to do some housekeeping there, especially with the modules that are based on some existing technology

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> just read this bit in the code of Template6

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that paren is required

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> otherwise it would attach to &&

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Or when you have to switch between not and ! because it’d attach to the wrong one…
