[13:23] <abraxxa> I¬¥m trying Raku on Windows (11) for the first time and zef fails to install every module with different errors. Should that work? I¬¥ve installed Raku with the MSI (not Rakudo Star)

[13:25] <abraxxa> Text::CSV because Zef::Service::Shell::tar fail, my guess is because Windows has no tar command

[13:27] <lizmat> hmmmm   ugexe ^^

[13:29] <abraxxa> File::HomeDir fails because it can¬¥t find a file which is there when I look in Exlorer

[13:30] *** jpn joined
[13:30] <abraxxa> [File::HomeDir] Failed to open file C:\Users\A312318\AppData\Local\Temp\.zef\File%3A%3AHomeDir%3Aver%3C1.0.2%3E%3Aauth%3Cgithub%3Aazawawi%3E.tar.gz\raku-file-homedir-master\.precomp\44915DAEDA6406CD6C8F002F1AE07CF06EA94EF7\5D\5DACBC5E09D57728B09EE6FD5073813AD953B889.repo-id.66781AL5B1MWWODZ3P3BWOLJN.tmp: No such file or directory

[13:30] <abraxxa> copy¬¥n¬¥pasting that into explorer even works

[13:30] <abraxxa> I could use WSL2 when Raku on Windows is too much hassle but thought I¬¥d give it a try

[13:32] <lizmat> abraxxa: sadly we don't have any core developers using WIndows anymore on a day-to-day basis :-(

[13:32] <abraxxa> I FULLY understand that :-)

[13:32] <abraxxa> I was forced by my employer to use Windows after 13 years of Ubuntu (and the switch to Arch happening soon)

[13:33] <lizmat> I shut down my last Windows machine about 20 years ago

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @abraxxa Here are the steps to fix this: 1) Change employer, 2) Go back to using Ubuntu.

[13:34] <lizmat> if it were only so simple  :-)

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Of course, that might be easier said than done...

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Right!!

[13:38] <ugexe> abraxxa: it is rakus own precomp process that is the issue (so you can reproduce without zef if you wanted)

[13:38] <ugexe> in that the paths getting created are beyond the max path length

[13:38] <abraxxa> why is the Ubuntu PPA not listed here? https://rakudo.org/downloads

[13:38] <rf> Morning folks

[13:38] <abraxxa> ugexe: understood

[13:40] <abraxxa> sorry, didn¬¥t see rakudo-pkg as I was only searching in the Ubuntu section

[13:40] <ugexe> to fix it rakus IO::Spec::Win32 needs to properly parse DOS paths (\\?\ prefixed paths, which are not the same as \\ServerName\UNC type paths), and moarvm or raku then need to use those \\?\ paths internally 

[13:43] <ugexe> abraxxa: you can try setting ZEF_CONFIG_TMPDIR=C:\Temp to shorten the path where zef puts those files which might sneak you under the limit

[13:43] <abraxxa> nevermind, WSL it is

[13:43] <abraxxa> until they block this too as the policy implicitly doesn¬¥ t allow it

[13:43] <ugexe> ZEF_CONFIG_TEMPDIR rather

[13:48] <abraxxa> so the maximum path length isn¬¥t an absolut Windows limit, else the path wouldn¬¥t have been able to get created, but one of the API Raku uses on Windows?

[13:48] <lizmat> afaik it *is* a semi-absolute limit on some versions of Windows

[13:58] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/03/27/2023-13-finitely/

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Template::Nest::XS wasn't me ^^

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> involuntary plagiarism üòÑ

[14:04] <lizmat> Nemokosch you did the update, according to the commits?

[14:05] <lizmat> ah wrong marton

[14:06] <lizmat> fixed

[14:06] <lizmat> afk&

[14:10] <ugexe> abraxxa: one way that might help explain how it works is how nodejs works since both use libuv. node "normalizes" all paths before sending them off to libuv, and part of that normalization involving converting a path that is like over 255 characters (or having a path part over 255 characters) and converting from C:\my\really\long\path to \\?\C:\my\really\long\path

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> üòÇ

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I got a bit scared lol

[14:13] <ugexe> and the reason long paths work with the \\?\ is because Windows won't down its own normalization (which isnt the same as the aforementioned node normalization) and validation, sending the path directly through whatever api

[14:13] <ugexe> for instance if you use \\?\ paths you cant use / because that is typically handled by windows internal normalization

[14:15] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/cadebd4e3e47180f8f15e54f288c06ac#file-win32spec-raku-L35-L41

[14:16] <tbrowder__> .tell CIAvash i'm trying to fork Pod::Contents but I can't get an account on your git repo (no email sent to me). i'm trying to download it and will establish my "fork" on github for now.

[14:16] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I'll pass your message to CIAvash

[14:18] <abraxxa> ugexe: interesting, thanks!

[14:18] <abraxxa> seems like a pretty important feature for Windows support

[14:24] <abraxxa> the FAQ https://docs.raku.org/language/faq.html says p6doc can be installed using zef for reading local docs, but zef can¬¥t find it

[14:25] <abraxxa> I guess it was renamed to rakudoc. If that¬¥s correct can someone please update the FAQ?

[14:56] <abraxxa> anyone familiar with Spreadsheet::XLSX who can tell me how to loop rows of a worksheet?

[15:08] <abraxxa> Spreadsheet::Libxlsxio needs a library not included in Debian

[15:48] <abraxxa> I just can¬¥t find out why .grep(/^#/) doesn¬¥t parse

[15:48] <abraxxa> Unrecognized regex metacharacter , (must be quoted to match literally)

[15:48] <abraxxa> the line number is incorrect two, says two lines after this one

[15:48] <ugexe> escape the # probably

[15:48] <ugexe> (just guessing)

[15:49] <abraxxa> why?

[15:49] <ugexe> *shrugs*

[15:49] <abraxxa> yes, that seems to fix it

[15:50] <ugexe> "The hash character # is not available as a delimiter since it is parsed as the start of a comment that runs until the end of the line."

[15:50] <abraxxa> I¬¥m not trying to use it as a delimiter

[15:51] <perryprog> it's considered a metacharacter, so you have to escape it to match the string "#".

[15:51] <perryprog> I'm not actually sure what it's a metacharacter for

[15:51] <abraxxa> I see, thanks

[16:16] <bpalmer> isn't it simply so that you can use comments inside a regular expression?

[16:20] <perryprog> Well, compare that with something like

[16:20] <perryprog> m: say "this is some text # and this isn't interpreted as a comment"

[16:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar cacd8bba9: OUTPUT: ¬´this is some text # and this isn't interpreted as a comment‚ê§¬ª

[16:21] <abraxxa> what am I doing wrong here? my $cost-center-tag = @tags.first({%cost-center-for-tag{$_}:exists});

[16:21] <abraxxa> no ¬¥normal¬¥ usage of the grep and first methods is shown in the docs

[16:21] <lizmat> abraxxa: looks ok to me, what is the error ?

[16:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @perryprog I just quoted to a friend your mis-quoting of Lagrange.

[16:22] <perryprog> :)

[16:22] <abraxxa> my $cost-center-tag = @tags.first: %cost-center-for-tag{*}:exists; doesn¬¥t work either

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @perryprog Can you listen to this interview ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5WZhCBRDpU . Or you hate SW too much üôÇ

[16:23] <lizmat> abraxxa: what is the error ?

[16:24] <perryprog> Anton, oh yeah I've been meaning to watch that.

[16:25] <perryprog> Definitely agree that LLMs acting as a front-end to a more "computational" engine will be a big deal, especially with regard to how awful they currently are at accurate synthesis (that is, when it comes to data comparisons, for instance) as well as memorization of pure facts.

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I plan to get more impressed by ChatGPT, because SW is impressed by it (them.)

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I this point I think "it is just generative text device."

[16:33] <perryprog> It is definitely not "generative text device". I'd recommend getting an account and just playing around with it for a bit. I thought the same thing before I tried it myself.

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @perryprog I got an account and played with it. üôÇ See "WWW::OpenAI" and "racoons playing with pearls and onions."

[16:36] <lizmat> how about a #raku-pad ?

[16:37] <perryprog> pad?

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ditto, pad??

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Actually, I think that interview by Stephen Wolfram should be listened by anyone here (in this Raku channel) -- he has a very "grammatical" point of view to the universe and its understanding.

[16:39] <lizmat> it was the name of the first off-topic general purpose notesfile on PLATO

[16:39] <lizmat> perhaps #raku-talkomatic would be more appropriate  :-)

[16:43] <lizmat> I think calling such a channel #raku-offtopic would be too on-topic?

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I thought it was fairly straightforward in Raku: everything that isn't downright an alphanumeric character, must be escaped or quoted in regular expressions

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think this is the most sane rule to regex I have ever encountered

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you can just quote everything that you don't intend to use with a special meaning, and forget about the struggle to remember what has a another meaning and what doesn't

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, it would be good to know what "doesn't work" meant
