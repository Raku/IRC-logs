[12:49] <grondilu> Hi all.

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hello

[12:49] <grondilu> m: class Foo of Bag {}; print (Foo.new("a") (+) Foo.new("b")) ~~ Foo; # was expecting True here

[12:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbc994398: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§No such method 'set_of' for invocant of type‚ê§'Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW'‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§¬ª

[12:49] <grondilu> heh?

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> re https://connectified.com/@masukomi/109807721943445406, I think this is the kind of case where everything works "as intended", and the main concrete issue is simply confusing oneself

[12:50] <grondilu> oh my bad

[12:51] <grondilu> m: class Foo is Bag {}; print (Foo.new("a") (+) Foo.new("b")) ~~ Foo; # was expecting True here

[12:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbc994398: OUTPUT: ¬´False¬ª

[12:51] <grondilu> m: class Foo is Bag {}; dd Foo.new("a") (+) Foo.new("b")

[12:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbc994398: OUTPUT: ¬´("a"=>1,"b"=>1).Bag‚ê§¬ª

[12:51] <lizmat> ah.. looks like the set op doesn't create a Foo but a Bag

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in a broader picture, well... I think tight coupling of itemization and a mutability interface is a source of many confusing things

[12:52] <lizmat> could you make an issue for that?  

[12:52] <grondilu> lizmat: sure

[12:52] <lizmat> I guess it should create the tightest possible type, for which we have the .are function nowadays :-)

[12:56] <grondilu> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5190

[12:57] <lizmat> thanks!

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, do the arguments themselves get coerced into Bag?

[12:58] <lizmat> only when they really need to be

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't think the bot listens through the bridge

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> although it would be cool

[14:02] <Voldenet> btw, recently I've seen discord bridge that colored names in IRC, it was pretty nice

[14:03] <Voldenet> regarding things that would be cool

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think that was actually turned off

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because of complications

[14:10] <mst> I'd be happy to talk through strategies for how to avoid ending up with complications if somebody makes a second attempt

[14:12] <mst> I've spent 15+ years now dealing with the logistical side of channel and network management, so I've both made and seen a lot of things go wrong and can hopefully help whoever's looking at it skip past those so we can get to the making new and exciting mistakes part sooner

[19:22] <pingu> maybe I should use regex rather than trying to check if a scalar list is assigned to a certain data type

[19:23] <pingu> ^[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9 ._-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ for filename+extension

[19:24] <pingu> it would be a little more efficiant to store the file paramaters as pointers, rather than copying them to a new scalar list
