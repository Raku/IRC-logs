[01:09] <leont> I tend to start with SQLite and then upgrade to PostgreSQL when needed. Turns out SQLite can get one pretty damn far.

[13:26] <guifa> method Str { ... }

[13:27] <guifa> can also be useful to make a different one for type objects and concrete objects

[13:27] <guifa> multi method Str (:U:) { ... }

[13:27] <melezhik> thanks

[13:27] <guifa> and :D: for concrete

[18:21] <jast> the difference is described in the docs for append: https://docs.raku.org/type/Array#method_append

[18:21] <jast> in short: append tends to flatten things

[22:42] <Xliff_> vrurg: OK. I think I have a handle on what I want. If I .^add_method to a class, what's the proper way to recompose? <CLASS>.^compose?

[22:50] <Xliff_> vrurg: Next question - are roles composed into a type before or after candidates are determined and added to the proto method?

[22:51] <Xliff_> vrurg: Please answer when time allows.

[22:51] <Xliff_> vrurg: Thanks in advance.

[23:32] <vrurg> Xliff_: Yes, .^compose.

[23:33] <Xliff_> vrurg: Thanks. Didn't work. It appears Method::Also can .^add_method without the need for .^compose.

[23:33] <vrurg> Xliff_: Before. And don't forget that the proto itself has to be determined too as sometimes it's not immediately available.

[23:33] <Xliff_> vrurg: It isn't determined at all during RoleToClass.apply

[23:34] <vrurg> You may need to recompose for non-moar backends to update method cache.

[23:34] <Xliff_> This is moar.

[23:34] <Xliff_> Give it a think when you have some time.

[23:34] <Xliff_> Thanks, again.

[23:35] <Xliff_> vrurg: If I were going to copy @!candidates from one class to another, what would be the nqp to do that?

[23:35] <Xliff_> Er... one method to another.

[23:35] <vrurg> Have you tried intercepting add_multi_method and, say, add a candidate twice, with the original and aliased name?

[23:36] <Xliff_> Tried using a role and it didn't work.

[23:36] <Xliff_> I may need a base class.

[23:41] <Xliff_> Class.add_multi_method does not fire.

[23:41] <Xliff_> vrurg: <Role>.add_multi_method doesn't work either

[23:54] <vrurg> Xliff_: then you do something wrong.

[23:55] <Xliff_> vrurg: method add_multi_method { ... } ?

[23:55] <Xliff_> Or do I need to override a HOW?

[23:55] <vrurg> HOW, of course.

[23:55] <Xliff_> How can I override a HOW?

[23:55] <vrurg> I'm about to pose a snippet in the issue.

[23:55] <Xliff_> Ah, thanks!

[23:55] <vrurg> s/pose/post/

[23:56] <vrurg> But take into account: it only works for a proto.

[23:56] <Xliff_> Can you include the nqp example I asked for?

[23:57] <Xliff_> Or at least point me to an example in the existing source tree...

[23:59] <vrurg> Forget about nqp. You do it all in Raku, even though playing with the metamodel.
