[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ugexe: sorry - went to bed ;-) ... I did have a short think (nightmare) about how to (easily) marry rg and rak ... but I concluded that having raku delegate regex to some rust code threads then begs the issue that this rust will need rewriting for raku regex format to get any syntactic benefit ... so probably the best bet is to point the rg devs to the raku regex syntax and maybe hook them on the unicode / syntax

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> win for their project

[12:46] <ugexe> mojo programming languages uses the .mojo and .ðŸ”¥ extensions

[12:51] <lizmat> librasteve or make raku faster  :-)

[12:51] <lizmat> and App::Rak for that matter: the 48 second benchmark should at most take 10 seconds  :-(

[12:52] <lizmat> guess I will need to special case single file searches

[15:17] <[Coke]> user question: if you have a link to github issues because you want to open a ticket, do you want it to link directly to "open a new ticket", or instead to the issues page so you can search before opening?

[15:18] <[Coke]> I prefer the latter, but feel to leave feedback on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/issues/93

[15:22] <[Coke]> .seen nxadm

[15:22] <tellable6> [Coke], I haven't seen nxadm around, did you mean nadim?

[15:34] <lizmat> [Coke] nxadm is called El_Che around here :-)

[15:37] <[Coke]> El_Che: tagged you on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/issues/2

[15:40] <[Coke]> .seen codesections

[15:40] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw codesections 2023-10-13T13:38:56Z in #raku: <codesections> Is it a known one or do we need an issue?

[18:39] <ab5tract_> ugexe: Anything stopping us from using .ðŸ¦‹ ?

[18:40] <ugexe> consistency with other raku extensions

[18:40] <ugexe> plus multiple extensions for the same file type are annoying
