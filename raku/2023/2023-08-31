[02:57] <elcaro> tonyo: FWIW... I cloned my repo to another folder, fez upload worked fine.

[02:58] <elcaro> It shouldn't have any bearing whatsoever, but the original location has a local branch that I haven't pushed. That's the only difference between the 2 folders

[02:58] <elcaro> but like I said, probably nothing to do with it.

[02:59] <elcaro> I only found 1 other person who had the issue a few months back: https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2023-04-20.html

[02:59] <elcaro> dunno what their fix was

[23:09] *** wayland is now known as wayland76

[23:09] <wayland76> Is there a way to print a list of which functions would be called if I called a function?  My problem is, I'm calling "new" on an object, and I've defined a "new" function on the object, but the first line of the "new" method never runs.  

[23:10] <wayland76> (and the program hangs)

[23:10] *** nort joined
[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland76 I think there is function cando you might be able to use: https://docs.raku.org/type/Code#method_cando

[23:17] *** dogbert11 joined
[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I am not sure can you that on method.

[23:20] *** dogbert17 left
[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland76 Another possibility is to use method FALLBACK : https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Fallback_method

[23:22] <wayland76> Turns out that's not the problem -- I added another "say" statement to the program, and it fails between two consecutive "say" statements.  

[23:22] <wayland76> But I'll definitely look up the things you mentioned.  

[23:23] *** nort left
[23:23] *** sena_kun left
[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I nice illustration of the usefulness of cando is the package "PatternMatching". (Its Raku code is 5 lines, the rest is documentation.)

[23:36] <wayland76> The pattern matching thing is nice :) .  Thanks!
