[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Not all languages make a clear difference between plural and singular â€” see  Chinese or Japanese. English does not provide clear difference between nouns and verbs.

[10:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Always existed in Mathematica.

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah the linguistic point is quite good; sometimes it does seem Raku is kind of anglo-centric actually

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the outrageous example being any() in my opinion

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If you live or work in the Anglo-Saxon world .

[10:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> any() and also kinda sorta none()

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I am sorry for being lazy here --  do the articles here https://dev.to/lizmat/series/20329 correspond to the Markdown files "it's-time-to-rak-1..4.md" here: https://github.com/lizmat/articles ?

[13:31] <lizmat> yes

[13:31] <lizmat> so you can haz a preview  :-)

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I see -- thanks!

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I am trying to publish this: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/Notebooks/Jupyter/TLDR-LLM-solutions-for-software-manuals.ipynb

[13:32] <lizmat> but?

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is a Jupyter notebook "TLDR LLM solutions for ~not reading~ software manuals" based on the "App::Rak" articles.

[13:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But converting to Markdown is a chore ... I might not have not put all references correctly. Hence, lazy questions...

[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Does this Markdown reference seem good ?  > [EM1] Elizabeth Mattijsen, "It's time to rak! Series' Articles", (2022), Lizmat series at Dev.to.

[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Non-lizmat people can voice opinions too..)

[13:38] <lizmat> perhaps this is a better URL? https://dev.to/lizmat/series/20329

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I use both links -- one for the "App::Rak" series and one of lizmat series.

[13:40] <lizmat> ok  :-)

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> References are the hardest. This the next Rak-LLM project I am going to do -- getting references on Raku articles, modules, and repositories quicker.

[13:43] <lizmat> :-)

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ideally, there would be a system that hallucinates "App::Rak" commands, executes them, and files GitHub issues if it thinks the results are sub-par.

[13:46] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> All authomatically.

[13:46] <lizmat> ideally, yes  :)

[13:46] <lizmat> and automatically fix them, even better!  :-)

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Of course, but that is another system, I would say.

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, this is a nice study project -- Stress testing "App::Rak". I am not discussion it in the notebook, but I might at TRC-2023. It is a very fruitful project, example-wise.

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat This command does not find files in the parent directory:  rak --find ..   -- is this a bug or a feature?

[14:08] <lizmat> that's a bug

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. Including it in the issue I am filing...
