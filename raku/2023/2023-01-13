[14:33] <[Coke]> Until I can cutover to ast - how to run a QAST node?

[14:35] <lizmat> Actually, I don't think you can, not until it has been turned onto MAST bytecode

[14:36] *** rf joined
[14:36] <lizmat> and for a given QAST node, am not sure you can without context, compilation unit, etc etc etc

[14:36] <lizmat> but then again I could be wrong   nine jnthn vrurg might know

[14:43] <[Coke]> Found my bug. in raku code, I was doing my $qast = QAST.... insteqad of my $qast := QAST...

[14:45] <MasterDukeMobile> [Coke]: the "executing qast trees" section of https://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/2018/01/perl-6-core-hacking-qastalicious.html might be helpful

[14:49] <lizmat> TIL  :-)

[14:49] <lizmat> mind you, that will not hold in the future  :-)    $*W is going the way of the dodo

[14:51] *** MasterDukeMobile left
[15:11] <lizmat> I wonder whether this is a bug in the current regex engine:

[15:12] <lizmat> m: say ",ü¶ã" ~~ / \C[COMMA, BUTTERFLY] /

[15:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§¬ª

[15:12] <lizmat> m: say ",ü¶ã" ~~ / \c[COMMA, BUTTERFLY] /

[15:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢,ü¶ãÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[15:12] <lizmat> compare that with the negation:

[15:12] <lizmat> m: say "ab" ~~ / \C[COMMA, BUTTERFLY] /

[15:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢aÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[15:12] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/raku-slang-date

[15:12] <lizmat> why is that just "a" and not "ab" ?

[15:13] <vrurg> m: say "ab" ~~ / \C[COMMA, BUTTERFLY]+ /

[15:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢abÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[15:13] <vrurg> lizmat: ^^^ ?

[15:13] <lizmat> but why wasn't the + needed in the non-negated case ?

[15:14] <vrurg> That certainly looks like a bug to me.

[15:14] <[Coke]> raku -I. -MSlang::Date -e 'say 2023-01-13.day-of-week'

[15:14] <[Coke]> 5

[15:14] <lizmat> [Coke]: cool!

[15:15] <lizmat> so is the bug in the negated or the non-negated case in your opinion?

[15:16] * lizmat feels in the negated case

[15:16] <[Coke]> Inspired by https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/microfeatures-id-like-to-see-in-more-languages/ 's "Date Literals"

[15:16] <lizmat> and now a followup blog post!

[15:16] <vrurg> lizmat: non-negated. It must've caught just one symbol.

[15:17] <lizmat> but why?  I always interpreted \c[COMMA, BUTTERFLY} as a convoluted way to say: ,ü¶ã

[15:17] <lizmat> *]

[15:18] <lizmat> but you're saying its a convoluted way to say: , | ü¶ã

[15:19] <vrurg> Because \c still stands for a single char. I consider [P1, P2] as a set of alternatives.

[15:19] <vrurg> m: say "ab" ~~ / \w /

[15:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢aÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[15:19] <vrurg> So, its no different from the above.

[15:19] <[Coke]> uploaded to fez.

[15:20] <rf> :[Coke] can you link the source to that slang?

[15:20] <lizmat> sadly, the documentation only mentions single character use of \c

[15:20] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/raku-slang-date/blob/main/lib/Slang/Date.rakumod

[15:20] <lizmat> yet the RakuAST node has "characters" as its attribute

[15:20] <rf> Thanks !

[15:22] <vrurg> lizmat: an error? Even the doc says that \c matches _a_ character.

[15:23] <lizmat> hmmm   that.s what the documentation says, indeed  :-)

[15:24] <lizmat> I'll make an issue

[15:24] <[Coke]> rf: any feedback welcome, thank you

[15:33] <vrurg> lizmat: BTW, I found no specs for the case. Could've overlooked any, but likely they're not there.

[15:34] <lizmat> I guess I'm enshrining the specs in RakuAST tests now  :-)

[15:38] <lizmat> vrurg: in RakuAST, it's considered to be a CharClass, which would make me lean towards the \c case being correct

[15:38] <lizmat> m: say ",," ~~ / \c[COMMA, BUTTERFLY] /   # but that doesn't seem to be correct either

[15:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§¬ª

[15:41] *** razetime left
[15:41] <vrurg> lizmat: for the sake of uniformity, I'd expect anything withing [] to behave as a set of alternatives, akin to <[]>. The only difference would be in using commas to separate props because these may contains spaces.

[15:42] *** synthmeat left
[15:42] *** synthmeat joined
[15:43] <vrurg> From that point of view \c would always be a single char. Besides, it improves readability because one wouldn't need to remember \c specific ‚Äì quantifiers talk on their own.

[15:44] <vrurg> Another uniformity would be to match behaviors of other \<letter> character classes.

[15:46] <lizmat> hmmm... seems \x has the same issue:

[15:46] <lizmat> m: say "ab" ~~ / \x[61, 62] /

[15:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ae9b4042: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢abÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[17:59] <[Coke]> The person who runs them does so but doesn't really do much else, so my guess would be: yes, if it was a simple change that was packaged up in a way that was easy for them to include.

[18:03] <[Coke]> Missed the previous discussion, but is there an issue/PR on https://github.com/Raku/whateverable ?

[18:07] <NemokoschKiwi> It seems to me that Tellable itself is not available anywhere so I wouldn't know how it can be changed

[18:08] <NemokoschKiwi> I was thinking that something like a .readall command could be handy, so that if I, or someone else from discord, goes to IRC, the bot won't start spitting a dozen of "missed messages"

[18:09] <coleman> [Coke]: papercuts like that are important, in my opinion. Can you open an issue on fez?

[18:10] <ugexe> i mean there isn't exactly a reason a distribution name can't contain a single :

[18:10] <ugexe> and in all honestly we shouldn't be using :: in distribution names anyways, rather s/::/-/

[18:12] <NemokoschKiwi> This is quite a good point in my opinion but it doesn't seem like there is a critical mass of awareness regarding this
