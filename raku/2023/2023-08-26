[11:47] <wayland76> Hi all!  Does anyone know why, a) it's complaining about both sides of the comparison in line 9, and b) why next can't return the $dfn variable?  https://gist.github.com/wayland/367998a78d71661fba065630aa1f062d

[11:47] <wayland76> If there's something I should be using instead of Nil, let me know! :) 

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think next could return a value in v6.d

[11:51] <lizmat> m: my $a = Nil; say $a   # NOT Nil

[11:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 695b9dc46: OUTPUT: «(Any)␤»

[11:52] <lizmat> also: $prev == Nil is a bit of a weird comparison

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> numeric check

[11:53] <lizmat> I would probably write that as: "next $dfn without $prev"

[11:53] <lizmat> is the check is really about it being instantiated or not, is my impression

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, it would require v6.e.PREVIEW language version

[11:54] <wayland76> Yes, agreed.  I'll try the "without" option you suggested :) .  

[11:54] <lizmat> still the code feels ... weird

[11:54] <lizmat> why the NEXT phaser ?

[11:55] <wayland76> Oh, just want to ensure that $prev is always the previous iteration's $dfn.  

[11:55] <wayland76> possibly irrelevant to the example -- sorry.  

[11:56] <wayland76> And, you're right -- it's 6.e.PREVIEW.  Is there an easy way to get that (with a "use" statement or something), or is it still to experimental/non-existent for that?  

[11:57] <wayland76> (ie. next returning values is 6.e.PREVIEW)

[11:58] <lizmat> add "use v6.e.PREVIEW" to your code ?

[11:58] <lizmat> or "v6.*"   :-)

[11:58] <wayland76> OK, great, I'll try it :) .

[12:02] <wayland76> Yay!  Now I can go to bed happy :) (it's 10pm here).  Thanks!
