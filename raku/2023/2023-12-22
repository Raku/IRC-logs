[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I plan to publish the first draft of "Streamlining AI vision workflows" today.

[14:33] <lizmat> great!

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve "App::Crag" does not know Chemistry, it seems.

[15:22] *** jpn joined
[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In think there is "no reason" Crag's users to use sigils (like '$') for the variables. This feature is most likely easy to support.

[17:38] <El_Che> I have *never* had a rakudo build without failing tests (for around 20-25 distro and version combinations). Today was the first. Congrats team! https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/actions/runs/7302141391

[17:39] <El_Che> (I mean I have to keep building until everythin passed, it takes around 3-5 builds most of the time)

[19:04] <[Coke]> are you building in parallel?

[19:04] <[Coke]> # of builds shouldn't matter unless something's getting missed, no?

[19:26] <ugexe> It is a bit weird that we have a reproducibility test that is flakey. A flakey reproducibility test essentially means it is failing. Rerunning that test is only working around the issue 

[19:27] <ugexe> otherwise just get rid of the test 

[19:27] <ugexe> because it is just providing a facade 

[19:27] <ugexe> I woild

[19:28] <ugexe> I would be interested in knowing if it wasn’t always flakey though, and if not what commit broke it 

[19:28] <ugexe> I kind of suspect it has always been flakey though 

[19:34] <[Coke]> so hard to bisect for flakiness

[19:34] <[Coke]> or, at a minimum, annoying

[20:01] <El_Che> new rakudo-pkg in the repos (except for Ubuntu devel)

[20:01] <El_Che> (cloudsmith needs to add the repo dir)

[20:02] <El_Che> [Coke]: I build in parallel, but the packages are only uploaded if everything is built ok

[20:02] <El_Che> [Coke]: the number of builds is very relevant because it's a matrix. There is always 2-3 that fail randomly

[20:03] <El_Che> [Coke]: lukily github added the option to only rebuild failed build. You had to rebuild everything in the past

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> antononcube: thanks for the fb ... I am inspired to dust off the Stoichometry (sp?) integration

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> antononcube: on App::Crag sigil removal, in crag it is no strict

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag '$h=450;$w=1520;$d=2315;$v=$h*$w*$d; say "$v cu mm"'

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag 'my \h=450;my \w=1520;my \d=2315;my \v=h*w*d; say "{v} cu mm"'

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> personally I prefer the sigil $

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ymmv

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Yes, but you mentioned that you were inspired by a "beginner's request" to make "App::Crag". So, I would say no sigils at all should work.

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think this is much clearer to a "beginner":  crag 'h=450; w=1520; d=2315; v=h*w*d; say "{v} cu mm"' 

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> beginner in raku, not in coding (the guy who thinks we are all gremlins)

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the idea is to do raku in a line in a rich library setting, not to redefine raku as, errr, python

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyway this is for fun and I do not have spare tuits to write some kind of parser

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> to redefine how raku does the basics
