[12:14] <ugexe> I don't think `unit module ...` works the way you think it does

[12:15] <ugexe> m: unit module GCL::Services::TCP; use GCL::Services;

[12:16] <ugexe> hmmm, i expected one of those to fail

[12:16] <lizmat> intriguing

[12:17] <ugexe> yeah, how is 666.c+ finding 6.c

[12:17] <ugexe> or 6.anything

[12:18] <lizmat> m: dd v666.c+ ~~ v6.c

[12:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar d15d6d7df: OUTPUT: «Bool::False␤»

[12:24] <ugexe> oh i see

[12:24] <ugexe> the core dist is using version 2023.06.63.g.04.bf.4.f.719.a

[12:25] <ugexe> i think anyway... im on a branch where i was hacking on that stuff a few weeks ago

[12:26] <ugexe> yeah that was from some old work. looks like its usually versions like 2023.02

[12:26] <ugexe> hence 666.c+ finding it

[17:57] <notable6> [Coke], Noted! (weekly)

[17:58] <[Coke]> that was just a basic update to include Raku instead of Perl 6 (though the maintainer didn't want to remove it entirely)

[17:59] <[Coke]> If someone is using ctags and has an issue, let me know we can probably fix it.

[17:59] <[Coke]> I made *no* syntax updates as part of this PR

[18:08] <[Coke]> I just tried it on one of my dists, and "vi -t sub-name" worked, so that's nifty

[18:14] <[Coke]> guessing next big thing might be: supporting unicode identifiers.

[18:15] *** jpn joined
[18:15] <[Coke]> can rakudo source be declared to be in some other encoding, or do we *require* utf8?

[18:17] <lizmat> Rakudo only supports UTF-8 atm

[18:36] <tonyo> probably works with ascii

[18:38] <[Coke]> :P

[18:39] * [Coke] wonders if we should encourage tone modifiers on this channel so I don't start typing out serious responses to jokes. ;)

[18:45] <tonyo> heh, i'd say it's much easier to tell if i'm joking in person but i'm frequently told it isn't

[18:45] *** vrurg joined
[18:46] <[Coke]> so I tried to find a few edges cases that maybe weren't covered by that ctags impl, but even a bare "multi" works.

[18:46] <tonyo> für?

[18:46] <tbrowder__> .seen tadzik

[18:46] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I saw tadzik 2023-03-01T10:29:18Z in #raku: <tadzik> m: printf("%.30f", (1 / 998.001.FatRat) * 100000)

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am trying to decide what kind of talk to propose / present at TRC0-2023. So, the following questions are related to that.

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 1) Anyone here using LLMs on a daily basis?

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 2) In what kind of workflows?  2.1) Just as a "smarter" search engine? 2.2) Jump starting projects? 2.3) Other?

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 3) What would be more interesting to discuss about LLMs: 3.1) General inclusion of LLMs in Raku workflows 3.2) Creating package documentation from unit tests 3.3) Rapid useful code generation

[18:57] <tonyo> 3.2 would be interesting

[18:58] <tonyo> an LLM generating test data and finding edge cases would also be interesting, as a replacement for something like Fuzz in haskell

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Right! Probably of great practical interest, since fair amount of Raku packages have good collections of unit tests, but much documentation.

[19:00] *** lizmat_ joined
[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo About "generating test data" -- to some extend that is why I made "Data::Generators", to test my data wrangling Raku packages. Of course, a more general test generator would of interest!

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Back to 3.2) -- here is a related document: "Expand tests into documentation examples", https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-LLM-Functions/blob/main/docs/Expand-tests-into-doc-examples_woven.md .

[19:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The test narratives are too detailed -- so, more research and/or refinement is needed... But the document does illustrate the feasibility of the idea.

[19:10] *** lizmat_ left
[19:10] *** lizmat joined
[19:24] <tonyo> i'd more interested more from the perspective of hardening unit tested code.  not a lot of people think to pass -Inf to their function that takes an number argument

[19:25] <tonyo> so something like fuzzy in haskell can be used but an LLM might work a little better for it

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My problem with LLMs is the risk of spending too much time refining LLM's results into something (sort of) useful and then finding out that it does not work reliably. (With slightly different inputs, different models, or model upgrades.) To some extend that is why I am developing "ML::NLPTemplateEngine",

[20:14] <tbrowder__> .ask tadzik are you maintaining File::Find any more? if not, would you turn it over to the Raku community so some of the issues and PRs can be handled?

[20:14] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I'll pass your message to tadzik

[20:21] <tadzik> tbrowder__: I'm not, no. I think I turned all my modules up for adoption all those years ago

[21:35] <tbrowder__> *transferred into?

[21:36] <tbrowder__> i'll be glad to work on it there, but don't want to take ownership in my repo.

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> either way it would be better than leaving it unmaintained
