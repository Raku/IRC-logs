[11:45] <lizmat> () don't create a list, the comma does

[11:46] <lizmat> hence no difference between returning (1,2) and 1,2

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> uh, [...] is a bit more magical than this

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but eventually that also just "enforces array context" on an Iterable

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's why [[[1]]] is exactly the same as [1]

[13:17] <tbrowder__> my problem is that [] and () do not satisfy the "is-deeply" test, but still debugging, maybe i'll try plain "is"...

[13:22] <tbrowder__> my bad, disregard, but i do have a long-standing gripe about tests "is", "is-deeply" and probably others

[13:24] <tbrowder__> if i do a simple test like "is 1, 2" where 1 is "got" and 2 is "expected"

[13:25] <tbrowder__> i get a failure message with results in the REVERSE order  which hurts my brain

[13:26] <tbrowder__> error msg something like "expected: blah; got: bluh"

[13:26] <tbrowder__> makes debugging much harder for my aging synapses

[13:27] <tbrowder__> i should have entered an issue and a PR long ago

[15:28] <ugexe> the first argument to `is` is the expected

[15:29] <ugexe> which then matches the order of the error message mentioning expected first

[15:31] <ugexe> as for which argument should come first... depends on which language you are using. In Go you usually have expected first, in perls Test::More 'is' has the actual first. the bad news is all tests written implicitly or explicitly are using the first argument to mean 'expected'. 

[15:32] <ugexe> so i don't think changing it is something that is on the table

[15:32] *** Sgeo joined
[15:37] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/type/Test#sub_is says the first arg is "got", not "expected"

[15:38] <[Coke]> I imagine the ask would be to change the error diagnostic output

[15:46] <ugexe> lol yeah i dunno how i read that backwards

[15:47] <[Coke]> changing the diag output is easy peasy but probably breaks roast.

[15:50] <ugexe> the spirit of the roast tests written that check diag output don't seem to be concerned with the format of the output, just that the output contains certain elements (although they test for those elements in a way that depends on the format of the next)

[15:50] <[Coke]> ... maybe easier if we add in an internal helper sub.

[15:50] <ugexe> s/next/text/

[15:50] <[Coke]> Yup, I think if 'use Test' tests *do* care about it now, it's correct to update them to just check that the content exists.

[15:51] <[Coke]> I personally don't mind the existing order in either case.

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's good to see some interest wrt how roast needs to be interpreted
