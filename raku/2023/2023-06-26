[13:52] <tbrowder__> ref weekly on =finish, actually, the =data tag is designed to replace Perl's __DATA__

[13:53] <lizmat> but until recently, =data was not supported.  And even now, it is only supported in RakuAST

[13:55] <tbrowder__> regardless, it should be supported. saying =finish is data is awkward

[13:56] <tbrowder__> =finish means ignore all following

[13:56] <lizmat> and make that available in $=finish

[13:57] <tbrowder__> where are the language police when you need them!  :-)

[13:57] <lizmat> I'm not saying it's ideal... I'm just saying that it will require a language version bump to remove the $=finish part of the functionality 

[13:59] *** rf joined
[14:00] <tbrowder__> it doesn't require a bump. it's documented in S26

[14:01] <tbrowder__> just NYI like a lot of stuff

[14:01] <lizmat> indeed, $=finish is not in S26

[14:01] <lizmat> =finish is, but $=finish is not

[14:02] <lizmat> however, there are tests in roast that require the existence of $=finish

[14:02] <lizmat> and thus would require a language version bump to have $=finish removed, in favour of using $=data

[14:03] <lizmat> S26 is speculation, *not* specification, not anymore anyway :-)

[14:04] <tbrowder__> i don't see any new rakudoc replacing pod6, just rounding corners

[14:04] <tbrowder__> and adding niceties

[14:05] <tbrowder__> btw, any idea how long $=finish has been there?

[14:06] <tbrowder__> gotta go, bye

[14:14] <lizmat> looks like at least since 2014

[19:54] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[19:59] <tonyo> rf: 52?

[20:03] <rf> tonyo: yup

[20:03] <rf> Works no problem if you exclude this "libz"

[20:04] <tonyo> in the META it just says `z:from<native>` are you positive it's 52?

[20:04] <rf> yes.

[20:04] <rf> native will append lib

[20:05] <rf> iirc

[20:06] <rf> I'll send a screenshot

[20:07] <rf> https://imgur.com/a/LionYq8

[21:19] <tonyo> rf: that's very weird, that message from zef should say `failed to find z:from<native>` and not `find libz:from<native>`

[21:19] <tonyo> going to look at the bundle as i may have mucked it up

[21:23] <ugexe> :from<native> gets transformed into their platform library name

[21:24] <ugexe> m: sub platform-name($name) { $*VM.platform-library-name($name.IO) }; say platform-name("z")

[21:41] <guifa> oh wait 

[21:41] <guifa> no :-(

[21:49] <guifa> I guess we could do `class X { method message { self.GENERATE_MESSAGE }; method GENERATE_MESSAGE is implementation-detail { 'X occurred' } }` and then each X would implement GENERATE_MESSAGE

[21:50] <guifa> I don't *think* the Raku language standard stipulates the exact content of an error message

[23:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Has anyone ever seen "Non ast passed to WANTED: NQPMu"?

[23:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I just upgraded to 2023.04 and am still getting that error (previously using a 2020 version)

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> it may have something to do with a ternary using imported enum values?

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I get a different error alongside it which I think is misleading: "Your !! was gobbled by the expression in the middle; please parenthesize"

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> for context, I'm using the classic chained-ternary pattern from Damian's Perl best Practices, with the values being (non-fully-qualified) enum values imported from a different file
