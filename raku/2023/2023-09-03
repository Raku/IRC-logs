[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Yes, I was able to install "Intl::Token::Number" last night. (The installation seemed too heavy on dependencies...) And yes is great. üôÇ

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Here is an example:

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1147979027567607818/Raku-Intl-Token-Number-LLM-usage-demo-1.png

[19:40] <tbrowder__> guifa: i concur with blessings for dwarring !!

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Which set of raku.land uploads of yours should cite:  "zef:guifa" or "github:alabamenhu" ?

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa The former seems larger than the latter... https://raku.land/zef:guifa

[19:49] *** jpn left
[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the other is for the old ecosystem

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the "p6c" ecosystem

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch Yeah, but guifa's most recent submission is in both. So, I decided to ask, "just in case..."

[20:08] <lizmat> ah, they shouldn't be in both

[20:08] <lizmat> that's an artefact

[20:11] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: 64ec6f79b1 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | META.list

[20:11] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: Remove Intl::Token::Number

[20:11] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: 

[20:11] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem/main: It lives in the zef ecosystem now

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Thanks! (And this the other reason I asked.  üòé )

[20:17] <guifa> lizmat: ty!  I forgot to remove it

[20:41] <lizmat> guifa: no worries  :-)   I would have otherwise noticed it tomorrow doing the weekly

[20:45] <guifa> What I now need to do is a localized regex mode.  I was looking over some engines and they will tie, e.g., <alpha> to the locale

[20:46] <guifa> such that English it's [a..zA..Z] but Spanish it's [a..zA..Z√°√©√≠√≥√∫√º√±√Å√â√ç√ì√ö√ú√ë]

[20:46] *** jpn joined
[20:46] <guifa> easiest would be <local-alpha> but I'm also wondering if maybe I could pull off

[20:47] <guifa> grammar Foo does LocalClasses[langtag] { ‚Ä¶ } and use that to add in overrides for alpha digit punct and friends
