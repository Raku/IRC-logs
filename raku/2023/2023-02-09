[01:03] *** xinming left
[01:04] <rf> That is simply a syntax error, try $data ~~ :g /\r?\n/

[01:18] <pingu> still isnt working

[01:21] <pingu> if @data_ldr ~~ :g /\r?\n/ does : Missing block at C:\Users\kris\Desktop\CommaProjects\test\testing.raku:6 ------> if @data_ldr ~~ :g /\r<HERE>?\n/

[01:22] <rf> try m:g/blah blah.

[01:27] <pingu> that works on the short regex but if I do it here I get: Quantifier quantifies nothing at C:\Users\kris\Desktop\CommaProjects\test\testing.raku:6 ------> if (@data_ldr ~~ m:gmx /(?<HERE>P<color_codes>(?:\d+[ ]){13}\d+)[ ] (?P<

[01:29] <pingu> raku is probably better at handling the exeptions so ill just use the first (shorter) regex then

[01:30] *** jpn joined
[01:31] <rf> I think there is a syntax error in your second regex, not because m:g

[01:35] <MasterDuke> (?:) i.e., a non-capturing group, is just [] in raku

[01:38] *** jpn left
[01:42] *** razetime joined
[01:46] <pingu> ok how do I assign the data that the regex matches, so a variable?

[16:35] <zashi> Hi. How can I include/use/require another raku file that is just sitting besides my current running raku script in the same folder? I've managed to build a module but this is not what I want..

[16:37] <ugexe> use lib $*PROGRAM.parent; use my_other_filename_minus_extension;

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> are .raku files good to go? iirc there was some extension-sensitivity involved

[16:39] <zashi> I tried .raku and .p6 and nogo

[16:40] <ugexe> if its a module then it should be .rakumod

[16:40] <zashi> its not a module. its just a plain script

[16:40] <zashi> raku script

[16:41] <tonyo> when you say include/use/require are you meaning run the script or embed its source in the parent, then?

[16:42] <ugexe> require "{$*PROGRAM.parent.absolute}/my-file.raku";

[16:44] *** razetime1 joined
[16:44] *** razetime left
[16:44] *** razetime1 is now known as razetime

[16:45] <zashi> ok, both forms seems to work, I just had to use quotes. any idea what is the namespace everything is imported into? can't seem to access subs from that file

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> simple: if they aren't marked for exporting, nor our-scoped, then they won't

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if they are our-scoped, hm, tbh I'm not sure but I guess you could somehow refer to the compunit?

[16:48] <zashi> well, the content of the file is : sub hello is export {say "hello"}

[16:48] <zashi> but now I noticed that whatever I put as file in require, I get no error, but I dont think it does anything

[16:49] <tonyo> zashi: if you want it to export into a namespace, you should have a file called `META6.json` that lists that file in the provides and at the top of your file you can do `unit module <Some Name>;`, in the script you want to say hello, `use <Some Name>;  hello;`

[16:50] <zashi> than I actually cant have a project that is multiple files? I have to split it into modules?

[16:51] <zashi> if I want to split a project by function = file then I would have a huge amount of modules?

[16:51] <tonyo> you want one function per file?

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> iirc require doesn't do importing on itself, import would. And use is a combination of them.

[16:53] *** donaldh joined
[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you can import a module and a module is supposed to have a certain file extension

[16:54] <tonyo> m: '/tmp/xxx.rakumod'.IO.spurt: 'sub hello is export { "hello".say; }';  require "/tmp/xxx.rakumod" <&hello>; hello;

[16:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1acb74d87: OUTPUT: ¬´hello‚ê§¬ª

[16:54] <tonyo> ^

[16:55] <tonyo> zashi: ^ you can import named exports that way

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh okay, require is apparently the runtime version of use. I mixed it up with need

[17:00] *** jpn left
[17:09] <zashi> ok, it works. having a file with .rakumod is acceptable. having a META6.json would not be, because that means I'd have equally count of folders :)

[17:12] <tonyo> module name and folders don't need to align

[17:12] <ugexe> require "{$*PROGRAM.parent.absolute}/lib/Zef/Utils/FileSystem.rakumod" <&list-paths>;  say list-paths($*CWD)

[17:13] <ugexe> you have to declare what you want to import when requiring

[17:13] <tonyo> you could just put `Mod::Fn1` in `lib/fn1.rakumod`

[17:22] *** pingu joined
[17:22] <zashi> but apparently I dont need to

[17:23] <pingu> how do I make this perl 5 regex into valid per 6: my $regex = qr/1[ *\t].[ *\t]0/p;

[17:26] *** freeside left
[17:28] *** freeside joined
[17:30] *** NemokoschKiwi joined
[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does it do? Not gonna lie, I'm not used to these regexes anymore üòÑ

[17:33] * lizmat neither :-)

[17:35] <moritz> rx{ 1 <[\ * \t]> . <[\ * \t]> 0 }

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> when moritz is around, he either changes directory or casually translates plain old PCRE to Raku regexes üòõ

[17:40] <pingu> infact can I do something like this: my $linetype  = qr/^^[ \t]+?[1-6][ \t]+/p;

[17:40] <pingu> my $color = $linetype~qr/[ \t]+[[:digit:]][ \t]+/p;

[17:42] <pingu> if I just did two if's or one if with an && it would still start from the beginning of each line so I decided to put $linetype inside of $color

[17:43] <pingu> since raku doesn't like long complex perl 5 regexes 

[17:43] <pingu> it seems to understand short ones, so I made each paramater a regex

[17:43] *** dakkar left
[17:54] <pingu> so it should be, any spaces or tabs (or nothing) followed by 0,1,2,3,4,5 or 6 followed by any spaces or tabs, followed by any whole number followed by any spaces or tabs

[17:56] <pingu> and yes that means any positive integer only

[18:32] <lizmat>   / \s* <[0123456]> \s* \d+ \s* /

[18:34] <lizmat> m: " 1 456 " ~~ / \s* (<[0123456]>) \s* (\d+) \s* /; say ~$0; say ~$1

[20:37] <pingu> it works if its one regex but not if its two: https://pastebin.com/vWf1UBSJ

[20:37] <pingu> if I do $linetype ~ $color it says im trying to coerce it into a string

[20:38] <pingu> if (@data_ldr[$i}[] ~~ $linetype ~ $color) { . . . }

[20:38] <pingu> if (@data_ldr[$i][] ~~ $linetype ~ $color) { . . . }

[20:39] <pingu> would $\(if the above code worked) therefore be the matches of $linetype and $color contatenated?

[22:50] <rf> .tell melezhik I have a large JVM based code base I want to run in CI, does Sparrow support JVM images?

[22:50] <tellable6> rf, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[22:51] <pingu> ok here is the full parser regex, now I need someone to convert it into raku https://regex101.com/r/HCK9jC/4

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> looks full cursed tbh

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> btw found the answer to my own question: CX::Warn control exception, CONTROL phaser can catch it

[23:07] <tonytheraku> Installed rakudo star from source this afternoon on aarch64 (Pi), seems to be working OK but the logs say that several modules failed to install, some flagged as [CRIT]. Is this a significant issue? Should I just try to zef them into place from the repos?

[23:09] <El_Che> rakuthetony: I would go the zef router. If I understand correctly, there is no magic in the modules in star: not pinned for stability etc. So updating sound ok

[23:09] <El_Che> 2c

[23:11] <tonytheraku> El_Che Thanks, will do, but wonder why the modules didn't install? Is I was missing something important enough to cause this, maybe the compiler installation would have flunked (but it didn't)?

[23:12] <El_Che> tonytheraku: no idea actually

[23:13] <tonytheraku> It's a minor mystery, but I've got enough working for now, I'll dig into the zef repos see what I can cobble together

[23:21] <rf> Is there a very idiomatic way to check if a positional is empty?

[23:21] <rf> if @list.elems

[23:21] <rf> I thought but it doesnt feel right

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> especially since this can fail on lazy stuff - remember?

[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "cannot call .elems on a lazy list", bool context, bang, suddenly it's "empty", although it's just lazy

[23:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a plain if @list is actually better for an empty-check

[23:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because that only tries to fetch one element to decide

[23:28] *** Simerax left
[23:31] <guifa> Agreed, `if @list`

[23:33] <guifa> or you can also prefix with ? to force boolean context (like if passing as an argument)

[23:33] <guifa> foo( ?@list, arg2, arg3) 

[23:39] <rf> I like if @list

[23:39] *** epony left
[23:55] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Call me crazy, but for code I plan to maintain, I like if @list.elems == 0 or @list ~~ Empty, because they're more explicit.
