[10:07] <lizmat> yw  :-)

[10:10] <guifa> That module I think probably is the most extensive RakuAST one so far written I think

[10:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am try to use zef upload for this repository https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-WWW-MermaidInk and I got a few times emails saying "Error reading META from your last upload"  with subject "Error processing: ???" (from no-reply@zef.pm .) I do not see a problem with the META6.json -- can someone point out what is wrong there?

[10:26] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/04/17/2023-16-student-win/

[10:26] <lizmat> tonyo ^^

[10:27] <lizmat> there appear to be some issues with some distributions being uploaded to zef atm...

[13:13] <tbrowder__> lizmat: i can't wait to see yr wrk on pod--much improved, i'm sure!

[13:15] <tbrowder__> also, i've revised my view of pod and its use. to me two separate ones: (1) as a simpler markup language but akin to TeX and friends and (2) extractable code documentation.

[13:16] <tbrowder__> i'm primarily interested in method 1 now as used in PDF generation

[22:20] <tonyo> in the mean time `git archive ...` and then `fez upload --file` should get you through the problem
