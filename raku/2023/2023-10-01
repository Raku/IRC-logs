[16:07] <coleman> I have experience w/ soju;

[16:07] <coleman> https://soju.im/

[16:11] <AlexDaniel> I don't see any maintained docker image for it

[16:19] <coleman> ah, yea. it's a Go binary so it's easy to ship up there, but it is not packaged widely (it is on Void Linux, tho)

[16:19] <coleman> I couldn't figure ZNC out

[20:11] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: if whateverable uses the most recent IRC::Client, it should automatically reconnect in most situations

[20:11] <tellable6> 2023-09-30T13:09:15Z #raku-dev <ab5tract> lizmat: how deeply tied to the current find-nodes implementation are you?

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: currently redeploying the bots makes them rejoin, that's a lot of spam

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: and sometimes they rejoin by themselves… I'm not 100% sure why. Could be that the peak memory hits the limit, or something like that

[20:12] <lizmat> ah, ok, like that..  hmmm  but how often would that happen ?

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> well, I guess not too often, but having an IRC bouncer would be so much cleaner

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> it's not a blocker for anything, just a very valuable nice to have for me

[20:13] <lizmat> ack

[20:14] * lizmat used znc once long ago, but got overwhelmed by the backlog every time I was away for a while

[23:38] <tbrowder__> can anyone get $?DISTRIBUTION.meta<ver> (or .meta<version>) to give a usable result?

[23:38] <tbrowder__> i.

[23:39] <tbrowder__> i've tried it in a real zef installable module but all i v

[23:39] <tbrowder__> *all i can get is '*'

[23:41] <tbrowder__> i can get the version using $?DISTRIBUTION.content after a little tweaking
