[09:58] <grondilu> Hello.  Anyone wants to help me figure out what I am doing wrong in this grammar: https://gist.github.com/grondilu/50e1143c3801c86fec9ee320e344f659 ?

[09:59] <grondilu> It's supposed to parse Wolfram language, the most simple form of it : Head[arg1, arg2, ...]

[10:00] <grondilu> Where 'Head, arg1, arg2' are atoms (identifiers or numbers) or other expressions.

[10:01] <grondilu> It shouldn't be hard, yet I can't for the sake of me write a working grammar.

[10:19] *** xelxebar joined
[10:36] *** razetime left
[10:40] *** merp left
[10:43] <guifa_> The thing that jumps out to me is

[10:43] <guifa_> rule expression { ……… | <expression> …… }

[10:44] <guifa_> that has the potential to hang because it'll generate an infinite loop

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Also, with rule you are saying — I think — that there should be a space between Head and square brackets.

[10:47] <grondilu> yeah Nemokosch is currently trying to explain that to me on discord

[10:47] *** merp joined
[10:47] <grondilu> left recursion and stuff.

[10:48] <guifa_> How about this?

[10:48] <guifa_> rule expression { <atom> <argument>* }

[10:48] <guifa_> token argument { '[' ~ ']' <expression>* % [',' \s*] }

[10:48] <guifa_> that passes all of your tests

[10:49] <guifa_> It also passes ok Wolfram.parse('Foo[bar][arg1, arg2, Foo[bar]]');

[10:49] <guifa_> Which I assume is also valid

[10:49] <grondilu> it does, but as I was discussing with Nemokosh, it makes it difficult for me to extract the Heads.

[10:53] <grondilu> in the correct order, that is.

[10:54] <grondilu> like say I have 'foo[one][two]'

[10:54] <grondilu> it's an expression whose head is 'foo[one]'

[10:54] <grondilu> I'm not sure how I can get it from the match object.

[10:55] *** sftp left
[10:55] *** sftp joined
[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> You need to change your rule definition to explicitly use rule for the “head’ expression.

[10:58] <grondilu> that hangs too.

[10:59] <grondilu> ah, nice.  I knew someone else had to have worked on this before.

[11:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> The section “Grammar derivation” discusses “your issue” in point 4.

[12:46] <Manifest0> Hi! The search function in the docs.raku.org isn't working anymore :-(

[12:48] <Manifest0> There are some errors in the browser console: https://i.imgur.com/lw0Wro8.png

[12:50] <Manifest0> oh... I needed to disable the localcdn extension.

[12:50] <Manifest0> It works now

[12:53] <lizmat>  Manifest0 perhaps make an issue for that so that it can be put in a FAQ ?

[12:53] <Manifest0> I have to say that i like this new website and how the documention is now organized.

[12:53] <Manifest0> lizmat: sure

[12:54] <Voldenet> Wow, those new docs look amazing

[13:00] <Manifest0> done: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/150

[13:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's safe to say that the search is a WIP

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it was becoming kind of urgent to actually deploy so the compromise to make was that some things won't be perfectly sorted out at the beginning

[13:12] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/02/27/2023-09-docu-renewed/

[13:15] <Voldenet> btw, regarding the styles on the page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets

[13:17] <lizmat> Voldenet: you'd probably want to mention that on the #raku-doc channel, or make a doc-website issue ?

[13:17] <Voldenet> lizmat: I will use that channel, thanks

[13:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's with the styles on the page?

[14:23] <Voldenet> Nemokosch: basically, firefox has this theme switching feature (also other browsers) that didn't even require js

[14:23] <tellable6> Voldenet, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[14:24] <Voldenet> so dark/light skins could be switched from the menu

[14:25] <moritz> it still exists

[14:25] <moritz> View -> Page Style

[14:26] <moritz> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..." title="name to be shown in the menu" />

[14:26] <Voldenet> I know, that's why I mentioned it :P

[14:26] <Voldenet> but it doesn't exist in chrome, which became current version of "the internet"

[14:26] <moritz> ah, why did I read "had" instead of "has"? :-)

[14:27] <moritz> haven't tried it, but I'd bet Opera had it at some point as well

[14:27] <Voldenet> your instincts told you that this feature might've been gone… :)

[14:27] <[Coke]> yah, the themes in new docs site are manual, if we can make it automatic in firefox, that'd be great.

[15:42] <[Coke]> wonder if it's possibly a MAX_PATH issue.

[15:44] <ugexe> el gatito: when you said you upgraded windows version what exactly did you do

[15:44] <ugexe> like a patch level upgrade, 10 -> 11 upgrade, etc

[15:45] <[Coke]> what does this say:  systeminfo   | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" 

[15:46] <[Coke]> (my version of sw_vers for windows)

[15:46] <ugexe> I don't see where uploading in fez would open a file handle

[15:46] <[Coke]> (I ask because my number is an order of magnitude bigger than 1803)

[15:46] <[Coke]> ugexe: doesn't it upload a tarball?

[15:46] <ugexe> it looks like its just passing a path as an argument to curl (which should interact with the handle, not raku itself)

[15:50] <[Coke]> You can clone fez locally, make that mod, and either run it from the clone or install the modified version.

[15:50] *** Sgeo joined
[15:51] <ugexe> you could also clone it locally, make that change, and then run `RAKULIB=/path/to/cloned/repo fez upload ...` I think

[15:53] <ugexe> it might also help if it was ran with --ll-exception, but alas there is no env flag for that so I think you'd have to do this little trick of loading the CLI as a module: `raku --ll-exception -MFez::CLI -e '' upload ...`

[15:54] <[Coke]> oh, I've been running irssi on a remote, old mac mini, and ssh'ing in and running tmux from various clients. using windows terminal (available from MS store) is a huge quality of life improvement when sshing from windows. unicode support, and links in irc are clickable!

[15:55] <ugexe> winget is pretty cool too

[15:55] <ugexe> i use it to install various packages (similar to chocolately)
