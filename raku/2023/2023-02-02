[01:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> It looks like I cannot run fez in 2022.12 -- it just hangs when I try to upload a packages. I reinstalled fez a few times, still hangs. Is this known or expected?

[03:28] <guifa> yeah
[03:28] <guifa> What's probably throwing you off is you're expeciting the dd($x) to output INT $x = 5
[03:29] <guifa> but UInt is actually a *subset* defined as `subset UInt of Int where * ‚â• 0`
[03:30] <guifa> so internally, it's storing an Int, just the variable is typed as a UInt (which accepts any Int greater than or equal to 0).  dd grabs the type info from the contents of the variable iirc
[03:31] <guifa> m: my Map $a; $a = Hash.new(:1a, :2b); dd $a
[03:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 015aacf2f: OUTPUT: ¬´Hash $a = ${}‚ê§¬ª
[03:32] <guifa> ^^ $a is typed to a Map.  But dd outputs Hash (a subclass of Map) because that's the actual contents of it (also, I didn't construct the Hash correctly but that's beside the point lol)
[04:04] <pingu> m: constant FLOAT = Rational; my FLOAT $f = 3.2; print($f, "\n"); dd($f);
[04:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 015aacf2f: OUTPUT: ¬´3.2‚ê§Rat $f = 3.2‚ê§¬ª
[04:05] <pingu> cool
[04:06] <pingu> shame I cant do my @str = ('a'); +str[0] +=1; say(str[0]);

[12:01] <lizmat> I've forked all of his modules to raku-community-modules
[12:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> There was a huge draft PR as well that I remember, about reworking list copying
[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It will definitely take time to sort out the work who was probably in the top 10 most proficient contributors in certain niches...

[18:09] <rf> One thing I might to see changed in fez is adding ignorable files. For example if I have build stuff that I ignore in .gitignore I would prefer if fez wouldn't bundle it
[18:10] <rf> tonyo: ^
[18:11] <tonyo> it should do that, using the ,gitignore file
[18:11] <tonyo> s/,g/.g
[18:11] <cfa> o/
[18:12] <rf> There may be a bug then, I ignored the build/ directory and it only seemed to look in the top level. It still packaged the directory. Is there any way I can see the tarball that is in the zef ecosystem
[18:12] <tonyo> which version of fez?
[18:12] <rf> 39
[18:13] *** Guest3794 joined
[18:13] <tonyo> try 40
[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> part of the reason why 40 came out recently
[18:14] <rf> Oh, nice.
[18:14] <tonyo> 40 put better typeglobbing (hopefully), <39 was kind of hacky and mostly because it relied upon git archive which isn't available everywhere
[18:14] <rf> Yeah that seems to have done it. Thank you!
[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> something else: do yall know about this? https://github.com/spitsh/spitsh I opened an issue for reviving it, would adopt it if necessary
[18:14] <tonyo> but you can use the flag `save-autobundle` to keep the sdist tar around

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <shmup> I'd probably just lose the word "spook" if you inherit it. Hell, Raku renamed its branches to "main" which would definitely suggest renaming that project üôÇ
[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how come?
[20:40] *** jpn joined
[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <shmup> Racial slur, probably wouldn't have said it at all if it was a different tense of "spook", but it's the noun spook, and the noun spook is a fairly known slur in the US anyway. Not a hill I'd die on though, re: renaming project   Just first thing that came to my mind and something I would definitely rename if it was my project, for my own feelz
[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> thank you for saying this, now I'm destined to not get any support unless it gets renamed

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well that's based for sure
[21:02] <shmup> it's a convenient simple little thing. a lot of people today who live in the shell, use wechat. but that's too fancy for me :P
[21:02] <shmup> by wechat i mean weechat***
[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my 2¬© is that it would be good to integrate the community on a platform that has discord's forum-like advantages (also roles), without the understandable and legitimate concerns that revolve around non-transparent, privately hosted stuff

[22:29] <pingu> quick question, how do I make a raku script that when ran, creates the file 0.txt
[22:30] <pingu> if ran again it creates 1.txt etc
[22:32] <El_Che> pingu: write the state somewhere? look around what files are present, etc?
[22:32] <pingu> if the file exists it skips, it never replaces files
[22:33] <ugexe> raku -e 'sub get-file($dir) { for 1..Inf { my $file = $dir.add($_); if !$file.e { $file.open(:create); return $file }; } }; my $file = get-file($*CWD); say $file.basename'

[22:52] <ugexe> on windows command line you probably have to do raku -e "" (use double instead of single quotes), as well as replace the .add("{$_}.txt") with .add(qq|{$_}.txt|)
