[18:33] <knarkhov> Hi, rakoons! Quick question - I'm trying to build Rakudo Star 2023.02, but build is failed with "Stage mast: MoarVM panic: MVM_platform_alloc_pages failed: 12".
[18:35] <knarkhov> Might it be caused by low mem available or smth like this
[18:36] <[Coke]> Very likely
[18:36] <[Coke]> how much memory do you have?
[18:37] <[Coke]> I don't know what the current recommended amount is, but I think 2G was the absolute minimum at one point.
[18:37] <knarkhov> Mem:           free:972M         used:54M        avail:864M
[18:37] <[Coke]> Yup, that's probably it, then. Sorry.
[18:38] <[Coke]> There are prebuilt options for some OSes off rakudo.org
[18:39] *** jpn joined
[18:39] <knarkhov> yep, I know, but I have a Rakudo Star with some patches, previously was able to build it this server.
[18:39] <knarkhov> anyway thanks for quick response!
[18:46] <knarkhov> prebuilt ver unfortunately is not my case, got Unhandled exception: Bytecode stream version too low on raku exec, old low-res server((((
[18:49] <knarkhov> last option for me - build it in docker and pack to dist, I will report about this challenge :-P

[18:52] <tonyo> knarkhov: there's some stuff built in containers already
[18:52] <tonyo> you may be able to just yank the build from
[18:52] <tonyo> i have a nightly here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tonyodell/rakudo-nightly/general
[18:53] <tonyo> been running since 2019-03

[18:56] *** jjido left
[18:57] <knarkhov> tonyo, many thanks!!!!
[18:59] <[Coke]> I have two CPAN releases showing on raku.land that have been replaced by zef releases.
[19:00] <[Coke]> I also have a 'Slang:Date' showing in zef that was a typo for Slang::Date - need to remove all 3 of these.

[19:15] <ugexe> I think for deletions an additional metric might be to allow deletions on things that have like under like 20 downloads
[19:20] <tonyo> right now i restrict it to 24 hours
[19:20] <tonyo> currently working on patrickb's enhancement to add checking for that kind of typo ^
[19:22] <[Coke]> I should also move my two p6c releases to zef
[19:22] <[Coke]> .. those two are also already duplicated on zef
[19:23] *** jpn joined
[19:25] <[Coke]> Not sure how to clean up any of those.
[19:26] *** notna joined
[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> wdym duplicated?
[19:41] <[Coke]> there's a version of the distribution in both 
[19:41] <[Coke]> (p6c and cpan copies of my distros will not be updated going forward, only zef)

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh okay. p6c distributions are easy to remove, at least
[20:01] * [Coke] finds https://github.com/coke/famflags when going through old github repos, and wonders if the $dayjob he created that for still uses it or if they have moved to unicode flags by now.

[22:26] <knarkhov> short report about struggling with running latest raku on low mem server. Well, I built my custom Rakudo Star 2023.01 inside Debian 9.3 docker on my workstation: [2023-03-29T20:46:38] [INFO]  The installation took 0h 06m 18s
[22:26] <knarkhov> Then gzipped whole build dir, copied to my debian server with 1Gb onboard))) and manually created a few symlinks /usr/local/*, checked their names in docker installation. Finally I've installed a few non-Star modules and restarted my web suite. It works: https://pheix.org/#rakuver
