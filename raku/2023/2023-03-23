[15:59] <rf> tonyo: When you say worked on do you mean mechanics?

[15:59] <tonyo> yea, avionics.  most of it was fa18s (all of the models the marine corps flies), mostly radar, HUDs, navigational components, all electronics/wiring

[16:00] <tonyo> was also an engineer for a while but that was mostly just trying to not get run over by heavy equipment operators and setting up tents

[16:01] <tonyo> and living off of water delivered in car sized balloons in the desert 

[16:01] <rf> Wow, thats impressive! I have a friend who works on CF-18s always thought it was a very interesting career

[16:02] <tonyo> oh! we actually got to work with some of the canadians in 2006, they came down to check out the benches we used

[16:03] <tonyo> quickly followed was an order that me and another guy that grew up close to canada had to stop doing canadian accents

[16:03] <rf> Lol! That's really cool

[22:25] <lucs> @lizmat: Is https://irclogs.raku.org/ implemented with App::Raku::Log as mentioned at the bottom of the pages, or is it actually with App::IRC::Log?

[22:25] <lucs> The latter appears to set up colors, but the former, not so much.

[22:49] <lizmat> lucs: App::IRC::Log is the generic module to set up a site with IRC logs

[22:50] <lizmat> App::Raku::Log is the module that uses that for the irclogs.raku.org site

[23:12] <lucs> lizmat: Hmm... So if the color handling (no yellow on white!) is fixed in App::IRC::Log, that will affect the rendering in App::Raku::Log?

[23:12] <lizmat> is this about the coloring of nicks?

[23:14] <lucs> Exactly. I just can't read some.

[23:14] <lucs> And it's precisely the one I was looking for comments from, eh.

[23:15] <lizmat> each channel keeps a map of nick -> colors and these are selected the first time they're encountered

[23:16] <lizmat> now, that selection is a bit random

[23:16] <lizmat> actually, very random

[23:16] <lizmat> I would welcome PRs to fix  :-)

[23:17] <lucs> Sure, and that's why I'm asking which module handles it :)

[23:17] <lizmat> I think atm its line 43 in App/IRC/Log

[23:18] <lizmat> yeah, I think it's using the default one

[23:18] *** tg57 left
[23:18] <lucs> Yeah, I saw about where it happens, but App::Raku::Log doesn't appear to be involved with App::IRC::Log.

[23:19] <lucs> So my question again:

[23:19] <lizmat> its META/depends says so

[23:19] <lucs> If the color handling (no yellow on white!) is fixed in App::IRC::Log, that will affect the rendering in App::Raku::Log?

[23:19] <lizmat> :q

[23:19] <lucs> Ah, I only looked at the code, not the META.

[23:19] <lizmat> not 100% sure, but yeah, think so

[23:20] <lizmat> check bin/raku-logs-server

[23:21] <lucs> Will do, thanks -- sorry, have to get back to what's cooking (not code, food!)

[23:21] <lucs> TTYL

[23:22] <lucs> lizmat: I looked quickly, yeah, I see it.

[23:22] <lucs> Thanks.
