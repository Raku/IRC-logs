[00:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Happy Thanksgiving, tbrowder! I am working on making Raku to have vision.

[00:35] <xinming> patrickb: it works now, I tried when I replied to get the error output. probably caching issue.

[01:21] <tbrowder__> antononcube: & happy thanksgiving to you, too! raku with vision sounds exciting.

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> back on the topic of DateTime::Parse, I have not seen any reply from sergot and there are PRs pending since Oct20, so I think we must accept that it is an orphan module ... please can we adopt it as a raku community module (and then accept the pending PRs)? [failing this, I will fork it and fez under librasteve as author]

[13:36] *** constxqt joined
[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube - I have looked into DateTime::Grammar (your recent fork) and there are a couple of blockers for me around composability ... so I would like to steer the DateTime::Parser to a better place also

[13:42] <tbrowder__> tonyo: hi, i'm having one major problem with CSV::Parser.   The show-stopper for me is how to use .trim on all columm contents (including in header contents). The test example for the Callable doesn't seem to actually do anything except increment a counter, and I can't get consistent results with my tests. What is the intent of the "header" arg in the Callable test example? Thanks.

[13:52] <Xliff> I'm getting this when attempting to build rakudo. is there a workaround? 

[13:52] <Xliff> Entry '3rdparty/nqp-configure/doc/NQP-Config.md' not uptodate.

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> is there a particular reason you are still using CPAN?

[13:54] <teatime> .w

[13:57] <Xliff> Who? Me?

[13:57] <Xliff> App::Mi6

[13:58] <Xliff> <nemokosch> Also, the reason I want RakuAST to serialize into ByteCode is that I want to run the AST once I've loaded it. I'll take what I can get, though.

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> App::Mi6 can be used with fez

[14:02] *** constxqt left
[14:02] <Xliff> I'll have to figure out how to register with fez, then. Will need some assistance on that.

[14:03] <Xliff> I'm fighting various time crunches as it is.

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think it really was just fez register

[14:03] <Xliff> I'd rather not worry about that though. I need to rebuild Rakudo and am getting the error:

[14:03] <Xliff> Entry '3rdparty/nqp-configure/doc/NQP-Config.md' not uptodate.

[14:03] <Xliff> How can I fix?

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> can't help with that, sorry

[14:03] <Xliff> OK, thanks.

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sure (i) you have copied the original DateTime::Parse code as role DateTime::Grammarish which strands all consumers of the original DateTime::Parse module and makes it rather unmaintainable.  I sympathize with the desire for DateTime::Parse to be (a) composable role, but I would solve this by your new module being a wrapper that goes 'use DataTime::Parse' and having sergot (or the new agreed main fork/clone) change

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> class DateTime::Parse to a role and then stick in some tests so that it won't regress, (ii) you have split the Grammar and Actions and I think that composable Grammar module files should come as the Grammar/Action code together and (iii) you have named the Actions as Actions/Raku.rakumod whereas, in general I would expect a set of sub Grammar roles that consist of Grammar-Action sets in each file and have that named as a

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> consistent, evolvable module tree eg. imagine /DateTime/Parse/Localized/[RU|JP|US|UK|DE...] or maybe we evolve Parse.rakumod to be a parameterized Role via country code? It looks like you have good reasons for the above (eg. you want to have a structure of Actions to generate raku and python and wolfram code ultimately) but I do not want this feature: the original concept of DateTime::Parse is exactly what I need.

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> A note from my compilation speed improvement quest, disabling the JIT makes it significantly slower (14.7s disabled vs 11.3s enabled, for the current test)

[21:40] *** sena_kun joined
[21:57] <MasterDuke> avuserow: same results with MVM_JIT_DISABLE or MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE?

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I only tried both. Let me try them one at a time

[22:01] <MasterDuke> yeah, MVM_JIT_DISABLE is a superset of MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Disabling the whole JIT makes it 20% slower. The expr part doesn't seem to make a difference.

[22:05] <MasterDuke> not surprised, but thought it might be worth trying

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I found a good file to optimize though. The one defining all my Cro routes probably could be divided up to avoid some imports.

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> If I modify my main App.rakumod file, it takes 4s to load. If I modify App.rakumod and load the Routes file, it takes 15s.

[22:32] <coleman> rebooting docs site. back soon.

[22:36] <coleman> should be back
