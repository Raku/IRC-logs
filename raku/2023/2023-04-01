[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Aozen Some of us are here to make enemies.

[13:29] <Voldenet> What's the point of making more enemies if pretty much most of humanity is your enemy by default

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Voldenet Damn, yeah! Granted, for some ‚Äúenemies you know‚Äù are preferable‚Ä¶

[15:47] <rakuuser> In a grammar, is it possible to invoke a specific member of a multi rule/token? Something like <foo:sym<bar>> seems work the same as <foo>.

[15:47] <tellable6> 2021-10-26T15:05:00Z #moarvm <nine> raku_user: also code in the wild depends on the behaviour

[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> And, coal-hating winter grandpas.

[15:56] <moritz> rakuuser: no, just like there's no way to invoke a specific variant of a multi sub

[15:56] <lucs> For what it's worth, sigils in Raku are more well-behaved than in Perl.

[15:56] <lucs> I can't quite figure it out, but the problem seems to be more with the multiple levels of indirections and evaluations.

[15:56] <lucs> Here's the same code, golfed down somewhat: https://gist.github.com/lucs/bb2613fa3b279d1a1fea85f35f4f7f89

[15:56] <moritz> rakuuser: instead, write `token sym:<foo> { <foo> }; token foo { actual parsing goes here}`, and then call `<foo>` where you need it

[15:57] <lucs> Maybe someone more expert can explain what's going on.

[15:58] <moritz> m: my $match = /x/ ~~ 'x'; say 'x' ~~ $match

[15:59] <lucs> Dammit, wrong channel.

[16:03] <moritz> lucs: ah, I finally understood

[16:03] <moritz> The regex you're building and storing in %h2<s> tries, at runtime, to look up a value from %h2<s>

[16:04] <moritz> so it finds itself, calls itself, and what does it do? it looks up a value from %h2<s>

[16:04] <lucs> moritz: can you join raku-beginner and explain this to nommef please (they might have questions)

[18:53] <Aozen> sadly i dont get notified but i saw that Anton Antonov Voldenet and moritz replied ty for saying something

[18:53] <Aozen> and no i am not trolling anyone

[18:54] <lizmat> Aozen: glad to heat, it's just that asking for perl guidance here is a bit off-topic  :-)

[18:55] <Aozen> i am new so second day here ( i came just to see the community)

[18:55] <Aozen> i dont know how things work or what i should do here

[18:55] <Aozen> hoped to make friends that is all

[18:55] <lizmat> well, we focus on the Raku Programming Language here: https://raku.org

[18:56] <Aozen> okay so what generally can i talk about? like only specific code in raku or like

[18:56] <Aozen> can i ask stuff about the docs and such?

[18:56] <lizmat> that's basically the idea yes

[18:56] <Aozen> okay so i want to learn raku

[18:56] <lizmat> sure, docs is also on topic, as long as they're raku docs  :-)

[18:57] <Aozen> i want to learn raku ( perl 6)

[18:57] <Aozen> which part from https://docs.raku.org/ doc should i start with? Language Reference & Tutorials?

[18:58] <lizmat> you could start with a very basic intro: https://raku.guide

[18:58] <Aozen> oh cool

[18:58] <lizmat> if English is not your native language, then maybe that has an intro in a language 

[18:58] <lizmat> that you're more comfy with

[18:59] <Aozen> its not my native but i can do good don't worry

[22:15] <Voldenet> I think most people here use desktop irc clients and sasl

[22:15] <Aozen> how does that work?

[22:16] *** teatime left
[22:16] <Voldenet> you register a nick on libera, then just type it in the client somehow, depends on the irc client

[22:16] <Voldenet> or you can use a bouncer

[22:17] *** teatime joined
[22:20] <Voldenet> just pick one of the clients and read the sasl guide for it https://libera.chat/guides/clients

[23:27] <uzl[m]> Howdy everyone, long time no see :)!

[23:27] <uzl[m]> I've created this NodeJS to Raku -- Buffers document, and I'm wondering if you think it'd be good addition to the NodeJS to Raku migration guide. I'm sure I could not be using idiomatic Raku or am making some mistake so I welcome any corrections. 

[23:27] <uzl[m]> Markdown for now, though I can mark it up in Pod if it's to be added to the docs: https://gist.github.com/uzluisf/80bd9d6b1a4011a560723ab61947faaa
