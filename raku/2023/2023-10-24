[00:36] <ugexe> %?RESOURCES adds the resources/ 
[00:44] <ugexe> tbrowder__: i just tested $?DISTRIBUTION.content("resources/config.json") on an installed version of zef and it works as expected

[13:07] <tbrowder__> ugexe: is it correct to say: only files listed in META6.json/resources can have their contents shown when installed?
[13:23] <tbrowder__> ugexe: well, i just discovered that any file listed in the META6.json file under resources can be accessed after installation. the only caveat being the actual location must be shown relative to /resources in the original repo. maybe that's what you've been beating me on the head with all along!
[13:30] <ugexe> yes. %?RESOURCES also only works with files listed in META6.json, although this might sound confusing if you've been using -Ilib instead of -I. (since the former doesn't have a META6.json to work with and has to just crawl the ../resources directory)

[19:40] *** jpn left
[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Ranges are not special, or rather, have no reason to be special
[19:50] <El_Che> we are all special
[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I uploaded the presentations so I guess I'm immune to some moody hasty change of mind
[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but still, it's very very disappointing how there is a culture to hang on to irregularities, pretty much for the sake of irregularities
[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> completely neglecting the alternatives, as if the irregularity itself was the virtue
[19:55] <gfldex> m: say so 'special'.all;
[19:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar a992d3057: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª
[19:55] <gfldex> Indeed!
[19:57] <El_Che> \o/
[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also, it's surpring, not for the very first time, when somebody makes an argument at the expense of exposing an even bigger mistake
[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "so you say coercive operations can achieve consistently typed results? wrong, they cannot"
[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ... hooray?
[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> these are kind of nihilistic arguments, questioning the existence of good design
[20:09] <El_Che> (I miss the context to give an opinion about $something)
[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> long story short, there are a couple of types that have an overload for "numeric operations"
[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> one of them being Range +-*/ Numeric
[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> apparently only I think that it's a problem that you sometimes get your variables coerced and at other times create completely unrelated behavior

[20:37] <El_Che> this one? https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/391
[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yep
[20:45] <El_Che> so the goold old discussion of orthogonality vs pragmatism?
[20:45] <El_Che> if I undertand it correctly
[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't get what defines "pragmatism" here, other than "let's not respect our own design"
[20:49] <gfldex> I hope to have moved beyond that and provide a path to a better Raku, that is not "pure"erer but provides better utility.
[20:51] <gfldex> I would love to see Range just work, the same way that Junction just work.
[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what justifies the analogy, though?
[20:52] <El_Che> (there is no judgment intended in the terms)
[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what I really see is that impure masquerades as pragmatic
[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if it were like "it's more pragmatic, because" and some argument followed, okay
[20:52] <gfldex> Luckily I never read the terms and conditions. :->
[20:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but it looks more like "it's not pure so let's call it pragmatic"
[20:53] <El_Che> I see pragmatic in this context as "it breaks orthogonality, but that's okay because it makes things easier for some contexts"
[20:53] <El_Che> until it breaks
[20:54] *** jpn joined
[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, with the "it makes things easier" part included
[20:54] <El_Che> the core idea is not that's "impure" but an explicit decision for a defined advantage
[20:55] *** merp left
[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is why I was trying to "steer" the discourse to a mutual ground by proposing alternatives that I don't consider less practical
[20:55] <El_Che> so I would only call something pragmatic if intended, not a side effect
[20:55] <El_Che> the perl-python examples were interesting
[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> whether it is an offset or scale method for Ranges, or generic arithmetic operations, like div itself was originally intended to be generic division
[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I ran a couple of circles to try to explain why I don't like the current way - the people who like it, why do they not like my proposal, in turn? That's something they should say
[20:58] <gfldex> I prefer to think of Raku as a practical language. In fact, most programming languages ignore the fact that they are languages and not algebraic expressions. Raku does care about being a languages and - surprise surprise - it happens to be very expressive.
[21:01] <El_Che> I suppose that the persons that have an architect role will weight in sooner or later
[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> again, maybe this is meant to be a kind of autological reasoning, languages being vague
[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but it all just sounds vague when I have a very exact question: what's the problem with either the methods, or the introduction of generic arithmetic operators, mostly left to the user space?
[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> are they not expressive?
[21:03] <gfldex> And I'm quite happy not to have to carry that burden. :)
