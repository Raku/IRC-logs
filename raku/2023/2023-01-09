[00:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perhaps I wasn't clear enough. There is a built-in type (I'm trying to avoid saying that it's an Str because I don't want some "hashy" solution to come up), and there is a custom enum that signifies something. Say I want to coerce the values of the built-in type to my enum based on some suitable custom logic.

[00:11] <[Coke]> I think you have to create the enum with code, not coercion.

[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That's too bad... not sure who said that all languages converge towards introducing enums as fully-fledged classes. ðŸ™‚

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> enums also respect coercions by the corresponding method name so maybe one could bake a subroutine for them

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> apparently vrurg has actually made this work: https://vrurg.github.io/2020/11/16/Report-On-New-Coercions#coercing-into-enumerations

[22:16] <tonyo> patrickb: yo, are you patrickbkr@github ?

[22:16] <patrickb> tonyo: Yes, that's me.

[22:17] <tonyo> i updated the issue #70 on fez that you have open, i'm open to some ideas on how to handle that.  i think that issue is pushing the boundary between a cursory check of `yes, this dist will upload` to full package management

[22:20] <patrickb> I see your point. Interesting question of where to draw the line...
