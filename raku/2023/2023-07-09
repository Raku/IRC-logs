[14:30] <tbrowder__> i would love it if some Windows expert would apply for a grant to beef up Raku github workflow testing on Windows.

[15:32] <ugexe> I did a proof of concept to make long paths work on windows at the raku core summit. Alas, doing it correctly proved to require far more work than I anticipated 

[15:37] <ugexe> that was trying to do it entirely in rakudo though

[15:38] <ugexe> doing it in MoarVM might be easier (contrary to what I originally thought). in all the places MoarVM does path operations it converts the string to some format, and on windows we could just add a new line under each of those instances that transforms the path as appropriate

[20:11] <tbrowder__> is that the main showstopper with Windows?

[20:12] <tbrowder__> and a ? on fez: is it possible to allow the user to see his password as he enters it%

[20:12] <tbrowder__> ?

[20:13] <lizmat> ::q

[20:14] <lizmat> oops  :-)

[20:14] <tbrowder__> or have an option to do so? or at least see a single dot for each char entered?

[20:15] <tbrowder__> seniors have a tuff time with unix-style passwords where nothing appears to be happeing.

[20:16] <tbrowder__> and a pox on all those othe apps that are so secure the owner can't see the

[20:16] <tbrowder__> one he enters

[20:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I have been working today on templates for generation full-blown rants. You might find them helpful.

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I started doing that mostly because you seemed to like the 12 step list of quitting Python.

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is an executed version of that template: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/Articles/Simple-guide-via-LLM-template_woven.md

[21:54] <tbrowder__> .tell tonyo i tried to 'fez remove' a module i just released today and was told it didn't meet the 24 hr window!!!

[21:54] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I'll pass your message to tonyo

[21:55] <tbrowder__> sounds similar to python pain to me, but with less ws edges

[21:58] <tbrowder__> antononcube: i'll bet you could write a good technical summary of why python ppl should prefer raku. it would make a nice addition to raku.org

[22:22] <Voldenet> there's few reasons why choose python over raku as well though

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Voldenet and @tbrowder I mostly writing Python trolling articles. So, using LLMs for that is just fine.

[23:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Now, making something more constructive and useful in that way -- i.e. with LLMs and templates -- requires a fair amount of iterations and vetting.

[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My conniving plan is to show "the promising results" to Brian Duggan, so, he would get inspired to change Raku Jupyter-Kernel to accommodate easier and quicker access to LLMs.
