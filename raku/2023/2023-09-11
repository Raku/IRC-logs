[01:04] <japhb> Xliff: I'm doing something less awesome there, unfortunately; I'm using the where in multiple (MAIN) multis in order to give them all a common set of options that I can capture -- and then feeding that capture (from whichever multi variant) to a routine that does the destructure using its own signature.

[01:04] <japhb> Xliff: And if you wanted to have the same signature on multiple different routines, you could probably use the `.signature` of that destructuring routine in your where clauses.

[01:04] <japhb> I hadn't quite gone that far.

[01:05] <japhb> Although now that I think of it, that might be a useful idea

[10:53] <Xliff> How can I get the capture a routine was called with?

[10:53] <Xliff> Or do I need to use a capture in the parameter list?

[10:53] <Xliff> m: sub a ($a, $b, $c) { &?ROUTINE.signature.List.gist.say }; a(1, 2, 3);

[10:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar e41ffda4e: OUTPUT: ¬´(($a, $b, $c))‚ê§¬ª

[10:53] <Xliff> I'm trying to get the above to return (1,2 3)

[10:54] <Xliff> (I think I've asked this before and forgot about it ... or something)

[10:54] <lizmat> the only way I know about this, is to do a capture

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> same

[10:54] <lizmat> m: sub a(|c) { dd c.list }; a(1,2,3)

[10:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar e41ffda4e: OUTPUT: ¬´(1, 2, 3)‚ê§¬ª

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> fortunately, you can still keep your arguments as well

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: sub a(|c($a, $b, $c)) { dd $a, $c, c }; a(1,2,3)

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  1 3 \(1, 2, 3) 

[10:57] <tbrowder__> yo, i just discovered cronitor.io for monitoring and displaying cron status. anyone heard of it or use it?

[11:01] <guifa> 2. deprecate indirect object syntax (moved to problem-solving) 

[11:01] <guifa> noooooooooooo i actually use this lol

[11:02] <lizmat> well, make sure your opinion is known  :-)

[11:02] <lizmat> and why you use it

[11:02] <guifa> the only reason I use it less right now is because Comma doesn't like it

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think the comparison with .& was a bit baseless, though

[11:03] <lizmat> yeah, it's a gnarly issue to fix with Comma, I've been led to believe

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> .& is the reason you can use whatevercode regardless whether you have a subroutine or a method

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it streamlines disposable lambdas

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> does this comma method call have a similar practical use?

[11:05] <guifa> but just like we have "die if foo" and "if foo {¬†die }" (sometimes one is better than the other), we can have "push @array: $item" and "@array.push: $item", depending on where we want to the focus for the reader (plus it removes the need for providing subs.  we have push @array, $item, but that's not needed because of the indirect syntax

[11:05] * guifa is  off to $day-job

[11:06] <lizmat> nemokosch guifa meant the Comma IDE

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and I meant colon üôÇ

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the word just got stuck

[11:06] <lizmat> ok, understood  :-)

[11:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but at the same time, I also don't see some big practical issue that it's causing

[11:11] <lizmat> well, it *is* causing an issue in the Comma IDE

[11:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that should be their concern. Honestly, they are highly privileged within the Raku community

[11:36] <lizmat> nemokosch OOC, in what way ?

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> they are pretty much the only ones who can financially benefit from the whole project overall, and given that, they don't give back a lot. There is a "community version" which is an IDEA plugin basically, and kind of a shareware version of the commercial product.

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It wouldn't be completely unreasonable, given the circumstances, to expect that they do more about the editor and development tools situation in a way the whole community could benefit from

[11:43] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure that "they" are operating at a loss

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dakkar I understand what you are saying. But, on the other hand, every recent Rakudo Weekly post is making a political statement, hence, it should not be that weird to have links to comments that proclaim political- and Raku affinities together.

[14:28] <dakkar> it's the "I support raping children and killing infidels" that feels a bit excessive

[14:31] <tbrowder__> antononcube: yw, hope you can use it

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dakkar Again, 1) it is just a link to a comment, 2) the comment itself might be "just" a sarcastic response.

[14:41] <lizmat> dakkar: I was in two minds about it.  Yet I think it is important to realize Raku can be used by anybody, it's open source of course

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> Ahahaha you guys saw my comment on HN? I legit was waiting for something to happen since every day I wrote it‚Ä¶

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Yes, that is the point I try to convey too.

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> You think you‚Äôre gonna be associated with Jƒ±had in people‚Äôs minds because of that?

[14:43] <dakkar> and child marriage, yes

[14:43] <dakkar> you are, of course, free to publish whatever you want wherever you can

[14:43] <dakkar> it's just the link from the weekly that feels off to me

[14:43] <lizmat> aerbil313 you realize of course that one of the core developers is transgender?

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> Do you think I2P project and Theseus OS are gonna think the same?

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> You guys are just oversocialized. Look up its definition. Get over it. Taliban is using Linux and open source somewhere in its org.

[14:45] <dakkar> I mainly wanted to make sure that lizmat (who does a ton of work and doesn't get praised enough) was aware of the content of the linked comment, that's all

[14:46] <lizmat> I was aware of it, yes

[14:46] <dakkar> then my "job" is done

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> There are muslims in every software community and at least %70 of them are supporters of Islamic Jihad and child marriage as well. They just don‚Äôt loudly proclaim like me.

[14:46] <thebb> :D 

[14:46] <dakkar> again, you can write/publish/proclaim anything you want, I'm not stopping you

[14:46] <dakkar> (not only I can't, I don't want to)

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> I like Raku, I thank you guys for the work you do for it.

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> It seems the most perfect mix of a language for small scale productivity.

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> I don‚Äôt see why ideology and politics are relevant here.

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> Ok dakkar, I undersand

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> * understand

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @aerbil313 "[...] Get over it. Taliban is using Linux and open source somewhere in its org." -- Yes. And after they saw the version of "Debian" called "Lesbian" they decided to make a version called "Talibian".

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> I don‚Äôt believe that at all

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> I didn‚Äôt hear anything about Lesbian. They must have created Talibian it because it rhymes with Debian and Taliban.

[14:52] <[Coke]> .seen codesections

[14:52] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw codesections 2022-03-29T20:41:00Z in #raku: <codesections> I don't have a release date for epee yet, sorry ‚òπ

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> We have a version of debian ourselves in Turkey called Pardus, rhymes with the Turkish name of Anatolian panther, Pars.

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a relevant link: http://www.lesbian.mine.nu

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think it has a Turkish translation too.

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> Taliban would not be offended because some people online create Lesbian, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. We get offended for more serious things like the burning of the Quran.

[14:56] <lizmat> and about LGTBQ people...  :-(

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> And LGBT walks in our own lands.

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> A few of my former Turkish students were much better versed in Russian literature than me.

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dakker Yeah, I also do not think Taliban would be offended by burning Lesbian.

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <aerbil313> I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but Westerners have a view of Muslims as idiot simple savages. We have a very clear and comprehensive unified universal legal and moral system. We don‚Äôt act with any hatred nor any mercy in implementation of our law. Those barbarian savages you‚Äôre looking for, those who are acting emotionally, killing and genociding every ‚Äúother‚Äù in their society are Hindus.
