[15:51] <[Coke]> tbrowder__: not sure on mac irc, but can ping here, a few of us have macs

[15:58] <tbrowder__> ok, thnx, here goes: i would like to be able to ssh into the mac from my linux box. is that doable? if so, can it be done even though the mac file system is encrypted as it wants to be? would hard wired access work if wireless wouldn’t?

[15:59] <lizmat> on the Mac, look into Settings / Sharing

[16:00] <lizmat> and switch Remote Login on

[16:00] <tbrowder__> thnx!

[16:02] <tbrowder__> any mac user have a book to recommend for new users?

[16:03] * lizmat has been using Macs since the mid 80's, so....

[16:04] <tbrowder__> of course, you wrote the book, i wish

[18:00] <ab5tract> tbrowder__: there are some good ones from Big Nerd Ranch, IIRC, one second

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Is the "no type constraints on an our-scoped variable" a compiler limitation or an intentional rule?

[18:05] <ab5tract> roguerakudev: good question.

[18:07] <ab5tract> I can only imagine that it's a limitation with some roadblock in the way, but I'd have to double check the design docs to be sure

[18:08] <ab5tract> tbrowder__: All the best books about Mac I know come from the Mac OS X era

[18:10] <tbrowder__> are they still valid at all?

[18:10] <ab5tract> roguerakudev: that said, it could be a somewhat unloved corner because our scoped variables are actually pretty uncommon in Raku code. things just don't tend to get modelled that way when you have easy access to singletons.

[18:11] <ab5tract> tbrowder__: I don't know, but as I understand it there's plenty in macOS that works the same way it did in NeXTSTEP

[18:13] <ab5tract> unfortunately some of the best also seem to be very expensive. However, there is one gem that seems to be way underpriced. check Amazon for Mac OS X Power Tools

[18:13] <tbrowder__> i use our scoped vars for export from installed modules maybe i need some best practice rec

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Another fun little one - I want to have access to a dynamic variable inside a trait_mod:<is>(Sub $sub, ...) routine

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> the obvious approach of defining it before defining the sub which is my trait doesn't work, I'm guessing because of the other things happen during compile time

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> throwing a BEGIN on the definition, i.e. BEGIN my $*PLUGIN = '03-handler-definition'; yields An exception X::Dynamic::NotFound occurred while evaluating a BEGIN: Dynamic variable $*PLUGIN not found

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmmm.... I vaguely remember seing the ''Big Nerd Ranch" before....

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> the order* things happen during compile time, sorry

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder if dynamic variables are even supported at compile time, in the HLL

[18:16] *** sena_kun joined
[18:16] <ab5tract> roguerakudev: does assigning it as a default value in the sub signature work?

[18:16] <ab5tract> m: sub foo($f = $*F) { $f }; my $*F = "bar"; dd foo

[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5606fb657: OUTPUT: «"bar"␤»

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Oh, interesting... nice workaround, but I'm designing a plugin API here so I wouldn't want to ask users to do that

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I wonder if there's a way I could wrap that in an interface or make it nice to use

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Oh well, this dynamic variable isn't absolutely essential

[18:19] <ab5tract> That's how it's done in the grammar/actions guts, just for reference

[18:20] <ab5tract> (the example I shared)

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Maybe Raku AST and macros will smooth things over :P

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> btw I don't think sub foo is exactly like traits

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> traits are evaluated during compilation, right?

[18:23] <ab5tract> yeah, fair point.

[18:25] *** Summer left
[18:25] <ab5tract> roguerakudev: you can always pass named arguments to the trait if you want configurability

[18:25] *** Summer joined
[18:26] <ab5tract> hard to say whether that helps you or not, not knowing the code but thought it was worth pointing out

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Yeah, I have some other things which will also use the dynamic variable, so I was hoping to have consistency there, but I have another way in mind to design this that will work just fine

[18:30] <ab5tract> sweet

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> also found a way around the our scoping issue :^)

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> just my-scope with the constraints (and hash shaping, which is also not allowed), then bind our-scoped hashes to those

[18:37] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> it does mean it then thinks the keys are strings, which they aren't since I'm using objects keys (specifically my type with :U)

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> but it works, minus the complaining about using an uninitialized object in string context, which I can fix by using .WHICH on the type object in the lookup

[18:38] *** verzit_ left
[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> e.g. %Foo::hash{Subtype.WHICH}

[18:43] <ab5tract> ah, nice trick!

[18:44] <ab5tract> I wonder if you could wrap that in a class and do that internally in an AT-KEY method

[18:45] <ab5tract> not easily, if you are attached to the `%` sigil..

[23:48] <tonyo> lizmat: what's the right way to go about submitting a grant request these days?

[23:49] <lizmat> truly, I wouldn't know 100% for sure: I don't think it has really changed though

[23:49] <tonyo> i have one regarding ecosystem code. do i need RSC approval before submitting to TPF?  that's what it was last time i submitted

[23:49] <tonyo> err, i submitted to tpf directly last time

[23:51] <lizmat> I think it's: 1. submit to TPRF, TPRF then asks RSC if it's valid  (because there are very few people with Raku knowledge on the Grant Committee

[23:51] <lizmat> but [Coke] has been sitting closer to the fire than me, so he may have better innfo

[23:59] <tonyo> ty lizmat
