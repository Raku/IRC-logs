[07:32] <tellable6> 2023-11-14T20:05:45Z #raku <tonyo> melezhik: can you update fez and try again? it should tell you what the missing prompt is on the latest version https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/blob/master/lib/Fez/CLI.rakumod#L25

[07:32] <tellable6> 2023-11-15T02:29:56Z #raku <tonyo> melezhik `fez h` will also help know if it's getting the config from the right place.  and it's entirely possible the key you're using in SparrowCI ha expired and it's wanting you re-login

[07:32] <tellable6> 2023-11-15T11:29:29Z #raku <andinus> melezhik: issues with rakudo.org downloads have been fixed

[07:32] <tellable6> 2023-11-15T20:15:36Z #raku <tonyo> melezhik: still trouble or ?

[13:22] <patrickb> I'm working on a fix for another supplies deadlock. But I fail hard at getting a seemingly simple code change to compile.

[13:23] <patrickb> Are `code` and `-> { code() }` equivalent, given that code is a code block that takes no arguments?

[13:24] <lizmat> code is a sub by the looks of it, and -> { }  isn't ?

[13:24] *** constxqt left
[13:26] <patrickb> In my case it's literally a block of code: `{ my $*PROMISE := $then-p; $vow.keep(code(self)) }` to be specific

[13:27] <patrickb> The compiler keeps throwing `Unhandled exception: Cannot coerce to Any with named arguments` at me. I'll throw a gist together. Maybe more context helps...

[13:29] <patrickb> https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/07fa4be13354e243f58d8309f8ad5de2

[13:54] <patrickb> I think I got it. Adding a & infront of my temporary code variable fixes the compile error.

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if I read the docs right, there is no % "hash topic" variable ... $ "dollar topic" is the main content of ths docs - which is fine since these days $ can hold a Hash ... there is an obscure reference to @ "array topic" mainly in the perl -> raku section in the case of subs that have no signature

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry discord is dropping my underscores

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so I guess all that is fine

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the DateTime::Parse module situation, perhaps it should be adopted as one of the community modules?

[14:59] <patrickb> thanks!

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "DateTime::Grammar" is much better!

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - I missed that one - thanks!

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sure, but that is also a "shameless plug." I forked "DateTime::Parse" and made it more proper. I know / think @leont liked it and used in his packages.

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/DateTime::Grammar

[15:11] <leont> I didn't use it in my package, but I think I wrote somewhere about how to combine it with Getopt::Long

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, I was just thinking today that the current condition of sergot's distributions is a problem

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> these are fairly integral pieces of software, like OpenSSL

[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, I said at the conference that "I could give examples" of integral modules in a worrying state... this is what I was thinking of

[15:32] *** constxqt left
[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and the thought doesn't go away 😅

[15:33] *** constxqt joined
[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is there a good place to post this as an "issue" (requests for modules to be adopted as community?)

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know... at first maybe we could just try to reach out to him

[15:41] *** constxqt left
[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @leont BTW, make next big TODO item for "Jupyter::Chatbook" is to parse cell magics given as Getopt specs.

[15:45] *** derpydoo joined
[16:13] <ugexe> The other half of the OpenSSL coin is does something like that belong in e.g. raku-community-modules, where basically any code can be merged and there isnt much going in the way of critical reviews

[17:16] <[Coke]> Right, it's not like standard library.

[17:17] <[Coke]> we only really have "shipped with rakudo", "managed by community", "remainder of ecosystem"

[17:17] <[Coke]> s/rakudo/compiler/

[17:18] <[Coke]> we could have different support levels, recommendations etc. for "managed by community" that cover that, I think.

[17:18] <[Coke]> And those modules get more review, CI, etc.
