[01:16] <SmokeMachine> antoncube: I was more reacting to the backlog when lizmat suggested the trait ‚Äúis shortcircuit‚Äù, I needed overriding && and || for Red, but had to do that on a different way‚Ä¶
[01:16] <guifa> SmokeMachine what are you trying to do?

[01:18] *** JonathanTart left
[01:19] <SmokeMachine> guifa: I‚Äôm not trying that anymore‚Ä¶ I was trying doing that for this: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/ac69941c40722a3321385200dca9e33eb1ca5295/lib/Red/Operators.pm6#L832
[01:20] <SmokeMachine> but I‚Äôve done that in a different way‚Ä¶
[01:20] <guifa> ah okay
[01:21] <guifa> when I finish it you might be interested in my new and improved regex module
[01:21] <SmokeMachine> And now, with out my computer, on vacation, I realised an easy way of doing what I was expecting custom compiler passes to‚Ä¶
[01:21] <guifa> i do like you and have moved to a ECMA262-AST class model
[01:22] <SmokeMachine> Interesting
[01:22] <guifa> but I still compile ultimately to RakuAST, via a GENERATE method
[01:23] <SmokeMachine> After seeing the BF module I‚Äôm really wanting to play again with EEL (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage)
[01:24] <SmokeMachine> After seeing the BF module I‚Äôm really wanting to play again with EEL (https://github.com/FCO/EventExpressionLanguage)
[01:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine See the section "Infix operators" for the alternatives of && and || I came up with: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/FunctionalParsers .
[01:24] <SmokeMachine> guifa: any snippet I could have to have a taste?
[01:24] <guifa> actually, lemme through it up on a branch 
[01:25] <guifa> throw*
[01:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Yes, event processing is very important! üôÇ
[01:27] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: that looks good, but for Red the intent is to make it looks like normal Raku code‚Ä¶
[01:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine I know what you are saying, but using these operators does look like normal Raku code.
[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> my &p = (&p1 (|) &p2 (|) &p3 (|) &p4) (&) (&pM (^) {10**6}) (&) &pTh;  is completely normal!!! üôÇ
[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh... bad example above. This one is better :  (&p1 ¬´|¬ª &p2 ¬´|¬ª &p3 ¬´|¬ª &p4) ¬´&¬ª &pM ¬´o {10**6} ¬´&¬ª &pTh;
[01:31] <SmokeMachine> Now my intention is, when I get my computer back, is to create an role to mix with raku‚Äôs action class and for (lexically) every map/grep/first get the ast for the block, translate it to red-ast and pass it to the method call‚Ä¶ because those are methods, it will just ignore the unknown named parameters‚Ä¶ but the methods from Red will use that to create the sql‚Ä¶
[01:31] *** jjido left
[01:37] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: but you with Red, we need to be able to do something like this: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/ac69941c40722a3321385200dca9e33eb1ca5295/t/06-better-map.t#L25 currently I have to run that code many times to try to understand what‚Äôs inside that block‚Ä¶ if what I‚Äôm thinking work‚Ä¶ that will not be needed anymore! And everything will be done before runtime! :)

[01:58] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/31 - blin doesn't even compile here.
[01:58] <guifa_> https://github.com/alabamenhu/PolyglotRegexen/tree/rakuast 
[01:59] <guifa_> to see how I'm doing the intermediate AST. Actions make the nodes defined in Classes, and those have a method called GENERATE that create the equivalent in RakuAST::Regex nodes (unfortunately I jumped the gun, somehow the Frugal modifier is causing compilation problems because its not deparseable ATM)
[02:04] <guifa_> SmokeMachine ^^
[02:05] <guifa_> There's a LOT of holdover in the actions nodes from my old code and it'll be cleaned up a lot, but Classes is much nicer looking and readable\

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Can you make the sub ecma2raku which you use in the tests of "PolyglotRexen" to be a module function. I want to opportunistically extract regular expression from LLM outputs. Using "PolyglotRexen" seems to be a good fit. (The use case is literally in the name.)
[10:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Hmm... I still cannot install "PolyglotRegexen". I think we discussed that before...
[10:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what happens, good sir?
[10:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch Lots of CompUnit  and test errors. The first one is Could not find Polyglot::Regex::ECMA262::Grammar.
[10:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what did you run? Let me try as well
[10:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I tried both  zef install Polyglot::Regexen  and   zef install https://github.com/alabamenhu/PolyglotRegexen.git
[10:38] *** razetime left
[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> confirmed...
[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch Thanks!
[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is my use case:  my &fr = llm-function({"Give regular expression for parsing $_"});  say &fr('emails');  # The following regular expression can be used for parsing emails: # # \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b 
[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The LLM output is text. but with &fr('emails', form => Regex)  I would get an array of strings and regex(es).
[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the META6 exposes the modules with different names than what the tool uses internally, I think it's a bug
[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Polyglot::Regex::ECMA::Actions when it really should be Polyglot::Regex::ECMA262::Actions
[10:48] <guifa> I'll try to fix that today, about to go to work

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Ditto, sounds cool. Can Raku be used a scripting language in Gimp? (I assume you are working on Gimp-in-Raku.)
[13:18] <Xliff> antoncube: That's my hope is that it soon can be. yes.
[13:18] <Xliff> Raku-Fu
[13:19] <Xliff> I just need to figure out how to register with Gimp.
[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Haha - so cool!
[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Gimp in Raku would be great too -- I can then hook it to LLMs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc ...)
[13:21] <Xliff> And the snowball grows so well and rolls down the hill of cool things we can make it do.

[15:56] <tbrowder__> leont: ref TAP windows failures, have you tried, as an interim step for now, commenting out any parallel testing?
[15:58] <ugexe> I thought we knew the TAP issues were related to long paths
[15:59] <ugexe> TAP issues on windows rather
[16:01] <[Coke]> is there a bug for this issue?
