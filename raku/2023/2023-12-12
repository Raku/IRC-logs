[01:15] <MasterDuke> what's the point of the 'compactable' method?

[01:26] <MasterDuke> .vushu: i get a 'substr out of range' error when building Raylib::Bindings, though it does install. is that expected?

[04:24] <MasterDuke> i get `Cannot locate native library '/home/dan/Source/perl6/install/share/perl6/site/resources/C71D39DAFB1D2C5664F76036FCEDF35E0B2DD2F3.so': /home/dan/Source/perl6/install/share/perl6/site/resources/C71D39DAFB1D2C5664F76036FCEDF35E0B2DD2F3.so: undefined symbol: DrawLineBSpline

[04:26] <MasterDuke> but i'll admit i'm on a bunch of different branches of moarvm and rakudo, so that may have something to do with it

[04:27] <MasterDuke> that was just doing `use Raylib::Bindings; my $white = Color.init(245, 245, 245, 255);`

[04:31] <MasterDuke> ah, my raylib.h being in /usr/include/raylib.h instead of /usr/local/include/raylib.h might have something to do with it

[04:34] <MasterDuke> hm. replacing the path in https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/main/configure.raku#L22 and running `zef install . --force` gave the same errors...

[04:44] <MasterDuke> ah, it was https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/main/configure.raku#L14 and https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/main/configure.raku#L35. i just commented out line 35 and let it use the corrected hard-coded path to my raylib.h and it worked fine

[06:08] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> but the installation should find the raylib.h automatically using pkg-config so Im not sure what went wrong.

[07:01] <ab5tract> MasterDuke: 'compactable' is to keep the size of the arrays mostly constant. that was designed to minimize GC, but something goes asymptotic there even though I'm not  clear on why there would be more work for GC run #10_xxx to do than GC run #1. .vushu++'s solution works perfectly but I am surprised that it is necessary.

[07:26] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ab5tract isn‚Äôt the problem that you keep on making more snow flakes contra removing them from the arrays, I just noticed in your gist while printing the arrays elems out, that they just kept increasing in items.

[07:26] <ab5tract> That‚Äôs it

[07:27] <ab5tract> I should have had coffee and done some more testing

[08:34] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to Rajhan

[08:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: draft for the 15/12 advent post is finished, please can you schedule it on wp?

[08:35] <lizmat> librasteve will do

[08:41] <ab5tract> .vushu: I backported the fixes to the layered, supply based renderer: https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/ff53731543df4cedd1c5f15fb0599c93

[13:14] <dakkar> should `raku --profile` still work?

[13:14] <dakkar> because I'm getting not great results‚Ä¶

[13:15] <dakkar> (2023.10 on MoarVM)

[13:15] <dakkar> https://www.thenautilus.net/~dakkar/raku-profile.html

[13:16] <dakkar> the code is https://gist.github.com/dakkar/e96dcdb3c0fc6c4ea138125ed138b259

[13:17] <dakkar> I was trying to see why a small application I wrote gets very very upset when I'm downloading a file into one of the directories it watches

[13:18] <dakkar> turns out, something in the IO::Notification code is slow, and every time the watched file changes, the event gets queued inside the raku process and eventually the whole thing gets killed by the OOM killer

[13:18] <dakkar> (yes, even when there's a no-op attached to the supply)

[13:19] <dakkar> so I profiled that minimal code (`raku --profile watch.raku` and `perl fill.pl` in parallel)

[13:19] <dakkar> and got that pretty useless profile ‚òπ

[13:19] <dakkar> suggestions?

[14:59] <ab5tract> I'll play around some more and see if I can get it to fall on top fill line without turning into towers

[16:22] <[Coke]> I thought those were implemented.

[16:24] <[Coke]> ouch. Can't have OUTER as a label.

[16:27] <ab5tract> kind of makes sense, no? but maybe could have a better error message?

[16:28] <[Coke]> at least need a doc note explaining that not all labels are cool.

[16:28] <[Coke]> but we could probably check if the thing we found is even a lable.

[16:28] <[Coke]> *label

[16:29] <[Coke]> I feel like the error should be on label definition if we can't disambiguate between the original object and a label of the same name.

[16:33] <lizmat> I feel that a label definition should override any other semantics

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: thanks for your questions - the working code for Contact is here https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Contact

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> it is not yet a raku module since I prioritized the advent post over test and release

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so I think that the way my Contact::AddressFactory uses a country param to pickup the country specific parser (which code was already covered in part 1 btw) is pretty slick ... but please feel free to code review

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also I have stripped out some of the to-be- module code - but I thought good to leave in the Factory despatch example ...

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just made some last minute edits on the post to clarify how this works ... happy to hear if I have misconstrued how to use use within a block.
