[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> You make a good point about the use case ("will this arbitrary regex work with my code")
[09:04] *** DarthGandalf left
[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> But I think the much bigger deal would be the opposite: write Raku, run everywhere
[09:05] *** DarthGandalf joined

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Especially since I think it would be quite uncontroversial that Raku regex syntax is superior

[10:42] <guifa> I think someone had asked about a module to get Raku syntax in another language.  I'm definitely open to figuring that out.
[10:45] <guifa> but I absolutely agree, Raku regex > PCRE

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I had to work with python regex a little bit and it's not just the syntax (even though I do think the Raku syntax is lot clearer)...
[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> No nesting of captures is kind of a show stopper
[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That's a significant reason why you often don't even need to write a fully-blown grammar in Raku
[12:41] *** jpn joined
[12:42] <tonyo> yea, python leaves a lot to be desired in regex
[12:42] <tonyo> and a lot of other areas
[12:44] *** DarthGandalf joined
[12:45] <tonyo> i only prefer PCRE because of the brevity..having to literal-ize non specials is difficult to read

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Interesting, I think that's actually way more consistent and easier to read
[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would say this not-trying-to-optimize-for-some-special-case is actually a rare and very positive occurrance for regex

[15:48] <tonyo> generally yea but regex is optimizing for a special case, otherwise index-of would probably suffice

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't really like the overall idea of treating regex as something subject to this categorization
[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but even then, index-of would rather be the special case of a regex, if anything
[17:52] <jdv> anyone know who owns the discord bridge?
[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, having to remember which characters must be escaped in which dialect, which mustn't, how they interact with other features coming from vim/shell/quoting/whatever, is really not fun
[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> sometimes (in reality: often) one will need to escape the escapings and count how many times something has to be escaped or in what context it is appropriate to evaluate it
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in Raku, you don't just get a Swiss army knife that tears these escape problems down (quoting the literal content) but it's actually a pattern that I think should be overall more encouraged. Don't make me guess which character has a special meaning in your intended dialect and environment - if it's a literal, mark it, and if you don't, it does have a special meaning.

[19:57] <tonyo> it's not fun but it's also not that difficult to remember, you're also not penalized for just escaping most things.  there's way more syntax to raku regex.  that said the raku regex is way more powerful and a much cooler way to handle tokenization/language extension
[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> considering it's value, I'd say it's way more difficult to remember than it adds value
[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also, if one ends up "escaping most things", that's basically an acknowledgement that Raku got this right ðŸ˜›

[20:18] *** jpn left
[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also, I wanted to confirm my memories
[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in vi, + and * behave exactly the opposite way
[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> + needs to be escaped in the regex to have the regex meaning and not escaped to have the literal meaning
[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> * needs to be escaped to be literal and not escaped to be quantifier
[21:01] <tonyo> most people don't need to escape most things..it's designed for pattern matching and it does it succinctly and nicely.  needing to escape plain text matching seems like a regression
[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> another way to look at it would be the elimination of "bare words" which never appeared in a context that is worth remembering
[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think it's actually cleaner to write 'foobar', or 'dead horse', or '[general]'; all of them on their own as well but especially the consistency this pattern achieves is something to be valued... especially when it's about strings or non-alphanumeric characters, I just can't understand what's so precious about saving two keystrokes
