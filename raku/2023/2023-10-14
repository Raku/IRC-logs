[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch So, are the topic(s) of your talk a secret?

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> no, quite the contrary, it should be public

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I even linked the drafts üòÑ

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ah, yeah, I see a talk titled "City dwelling losers, pear-shaped."

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think you're looking at the Wolfram conference

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> LOL üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> WTC-2023 is two days after TRC-2023.

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Today I have been trying to start preparing for WTC-2023, but I keep ending up preparing for TRC-2023...

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> better than the other way around

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ üôÇ

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> at some point, the default date format changed to contain fractions of a second

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder just how many tests this change alone broke

[19:20] *** Nemokosch joined
[19:20] <Nemokosch> bisectable:¬† say DateTime.new: :1year, second => 1.134565

[19:20] <bisectable6> Nemokosch, Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[19:20] <bisectable6> Nemokosch, ¬¶6c (72 commits): ¬´0001-01-01T00:00:01.134565Z‚ê§¬ª

[19:20] <bisectable6> Nemokosch, Nothing to bisect!

[19:21] <Nemokosch> then what exactly is needed to reproduce it? it clearly didn't always add the fractional part for cases that are tested for

[19:21] <Nemokosch> this is the second time a random module has test cases broken because of the fractional part

[20:35] <mst> gah

[20:36] <mst> other people's languages should steal .= already

[20:36] <mst> foo = foo.method(...) just isn't as nice

[20:51] *** buildable6 left
[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what languages do you use?

[20:51] *** buildable6 joined
[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think "other languages" that adopted monadic operators -- forwared feed ==> in Raku -- are more convenient to make pipelines with. =.  can be chained, but that produces unexpected results.

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch I have a Hungarian question.

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> sure?

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Does this translation seem correct, faithful?

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1162859630431588442/Screenshot_2023-10-14_at_5.08.24_PM.png?ex=653d786c&is=652b036c&hm=f600abf60907f3bbae0b7c422f7d8e25f4678087833ea4159fbd753a7bce88e2&

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mmmm... that example is too wordy, I will change it. But still it is good to know is the Hungarian correct.

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there are strong calques for sure

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "let me tell you" - I don't know if there is an expression like this that doesn't slip to a more pedantic, "journalist" stylistic layer

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but in any case, nobody would actually say "engedj elmes√©lni"

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's really just a naive calque

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "√°t√∂leltem a ≈ër√ºletet" - this is like the last nail

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> wrong article and completely undecipherable word-by-word translation

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "embrace" has a meaning that is really hard to translate

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is the problem with all translations, in my opinion

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> one just doesn't speak the same way

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't phrase things in Hungarian in a way that would require a verb like "embrace"

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, the LLM persona used is named MadHatter, but that does not mean wrong grammar or style.

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in English, actually I do, it can be acquired

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, good to know!
