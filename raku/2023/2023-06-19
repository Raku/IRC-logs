[15:36] *** somebody1807 joined
[15:39] <somebody1807> Is it practically possible to, using "trait_mod:<is>", wrap a method? I have been attempting it for the last 48 hours with little success. Is there some showstopping reason I'm unaware of? The goal is to, by applying a trait to a method, cause it to be protected by a Lock.protect call.

[15:40] <somebody1807> A lot of the problems seem to be stemming from trait_mod doing its business at compile time, unless I'm mistaken.

[15:43] <somebody1807> Here's a simple example of the issue I'm facing from my attempted solution: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2558851

[15:44] <somebody1807> It just spits out the unhelpful error: "Error while compiling" and "No such symbol 'Test'"

[15:46] <somebody1807> If I move the class definition into the same file as the main script, it works as expected...

[15:47] <tonyo> tbrowder__: nah i live in bend, technically a desert @ 4k feet

[15:49] *** abraxxa left
[15:54] <ugexe> somebody1807: there are a couple of unrelated things wrong with that code. First, `state` isn't thread safe. Second, using a hash without protecting reads/writes is not thread safe. Third, using 'Test' as a import name is not a great idea because `use Test` will work regardless of your code (i.e. everyone has a Test module installed)

[15:56] <somebody1807> State, in this context, I believe doesn't need to be thread safe. This code block is only entered at that point during the compilation phase. I think the same also applies to the hash, in this instance, since it is only being modified during compilation

[15:57] <somebody1807> I have changed the class name as suggested, and the result appears to still be the same.

[15:59] <somebody1807> ugexe, do you have any idea for the resulting compilation error?

[16:00] <ugexe> not really, you could proably add 'no precompilation' under 'unit class Test' to work around it

[16:00] <somebody1807> ... That seems to allow it to run. Wow.

[16:01] <somebody1807> Rakudo bug?

[16:01] <ugexe> right. script dont get precompiled, so when you put it inside the script it also avoids the issu

[16:01] <ugexe> probably a bug yeah

[16:03] <somebody1807> Does the module itself get compiled upon using it, or upon instantatiating it, if I use that "no precompilation" pragma?

[16:05] <somebody1807> Oh nevermind. I think it just means that delay to the programs start, from compiling that module, will be always present in the startup time. Not a big deal.

[16:07] <dakkar> somebody1807: https://gist.github.com/dakkar/d1a44ad8febfdbd0fbdb5d7cd3994d4e this seems to work for me

[16:08] <dakkar> I've moved the lock into the object, because it's where it belongs (and your code leaks locks 😜)

[16:09] <dakkar> I'm sure there's a sensible way to access a private lock, but I got confused and gave up

[16:10] *** jpn left
[16:11] <somebody1807> I'm digesting it all, but can you expand a bit upon my code leaking locks?

[16:12] <somebody1807> You mean upon object destruction?

[16:14] <somebody1807> Yes I see you are right. Leaves things behind in the hash. Naughty me

[16:14] *** jpn joined
[16:17] <gfldex> somebody1807 dakkar please not that trait_mod:<is> will always be called on the proto is the method is a multi. You have to fiddle with the .candidates by hand in that case.

[16:17] <dakkar> ah yes

[16:17] <gfldex> And I think I forgot to file that Rakudobug. Thanks for reminding me!

[16:17] <dakkar> wrapping a multi is trickier

[16:18] <somebody1807> The depth of raku is infinite. There is a long journey ahead

[16:18] <gfldex> you may have a look at https://raku.land/cpan:JNTHN/OO::Monitors

[19:58] <kueppo> so I have this output and I expected "see" to come after somehow before the "look"s, would like to know what I'm doing wrong.

[19:59] <moritz_> kueppo: the @k.map is lazy, is that intentional?

[20:00] *** derpydoo left
[20:00] *** jpn left
[20:01] <kueppo> No, no. thought that we could only lazy a block/statement by prefixing it with the "lazy" keyword.

[20:02] <moritz_> if you write "eager @k.map", the "look" comes before the "see" output

[20:03] <moritz_> the `start` blog returns a value, and in your case that's te lazy iterator of the @k.map

[20:04] <moritz_> the "await" at the end breaks the laziness ("reifies" the iterator, as we say), which is why look is printed at all

[20:05] <kueppo> ouch! understood, thank you.

[20:05] *** Xliff left
[20:06] <moritz_> if you write `my \dummy = await $p` then you assing the lazy list to a dummy variable and never reify it, the "look"s are never printed

Then calling

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo>    # Converts a UTF8 Raku string into a UTF8 little endian C string

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo>    # $CStr = CArray[uint8].new( $RakuStr.encode.list );

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo>    # $CStr[ $CStr.elems ] = 0;

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo>    $CStr = CArray[uint8].new( $RakuStr.encode.list, 0 );

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo>    return $CStr;

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo> }

[20:13] <ToddAndMargo> sub to-UTF16-c-str( Str $RakuStr ) returns CArray[uint16] is export( :to-UTF16-c-str )  {

[20:20] <ntdll90> Hi, ToddAndMargo! Thanks for your reply. But how it can solve my problem?

[20:27] <ToddAndMargo> It converts a C Array string to Raku Str.  Maybe I misunderstand the issue.

[20:28] <ToddAndMargo> Uoops I give to other way around.

[21:02] <ToddAndMargo> in your call, shouldn't @buf.elems be an integer, not an array.  I'd do a loop on @buf from 0 to @buf.elems-1, and convert each cell with chr() to a string. `~=` will append the next character to the string.
