[10:28] <wayland76> Hi!  I'm making some objects and pushing them into a list, but I want to avoid duplicates (ie. the exact same object being in the list twice).  Does anyone have any tips for me on how to find out if a particular object is already in a list?  

[10:29] <lizmat> https://docs.raku.org/type/independent-routines#routine_unique

[10:29] *** abraxxa joined
[10:29] *** abraxxa left
[10:29] <lizmat> so what you'd basically do, is to push to the array, and then run .= unique on it

[10:30] <lizmat> or if your objects can be part of a Seq, it could be something like

[10:30] <lizmat> my @unique-objects = objects.producer.unique

[10:31] *** abraxxa joined
[10:33] <wayland76> Thanks!  Very useful.  That helped me find the answer I used: if (not $dfn ∈ @!nodes) { @!nodes.push: $dfn; }
