[00:14] <[Coke]> vendethiel: IMO, we should not have placeholder releases in the ecosystem.

[00:16] <tonyo> placeholders shouldn't be needed with the auth system .. dist:auth:ver:api

[00:16] <tonyo> prevents name sitting on good dist names

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Tell that to ingy :-)

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I don’t think you can say this is about namesquatting, the opposite rather.

[01:45] <ingy> it is just a shared library binding, so not a lot of raku work to do

[10:03] <erik``> Hi!  I am trying to groc grammars.  I'm looking to conditionally substitute part of a string depending on context.  When a method in the action recognizes this context, I want another set of methods to become active.  Is this possible?

[10:05] *** dbonnafo joined
[10:10] *** dbonnafo left
[10:18] <lizmat> that sounds like a slang ?

[10:50] <erik``> I will try to look into slangs.  Thank you for the pointer.

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> erik``: that’s when parsing using grammars, yes? Wouldn’t you just have two different rules in your grammar?

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> You can also use a dynamic variable

[10:52] *** buildable6 left
[10:54] *** buildable6 joined
[11:00] <erik``> vendethiel:  This is when parsing using grammars, you are right.  The problem is that I want the effect of an action for a specific rule to depend on the context which it appears in.  To give some more details about what I am doing: I am parsing a datalog program, and if an expression appears as the left hand side of a deduction rule, I want the action to behave differently. 

[11:01] <erik``> Deduction rule in datalog, so not a rule in raku.

[11:01] <lizmat> then using a dynamic variable feels like the simplest solution

[11:03] <erik``> All right, I will investigate dynamic variables.

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> What’s the difference between both?

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Sounds like something that should be resolved later than att parse time

[11:09] <lizmat> you can create a dynamic variable inside a token/rule/regex with :my $*FOO

[11:09] <lizmat> :my $*FOO;

[11:09] <lizmat> actually, the semicolon is needed

[11:16] <erik``> vendethiel: difference between what?

[11:16] <erik``> My intention was to solve this inside an action.  Should I not take this approach?

[11:19] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Your grammar should produce a syntax tree

[11:19] *** nine left
[11:19] *** nine joined
[11:19] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I think to parse datalog you shouldn’t need it at this stage

[11:20] <lizmat> well, not necessarily: e.g. the sprintf grammar produces a string  :-)

[11:22] <erik``> I am intending to make relatively simple modifications to the datalog code, and thought to simply let the action do the pattern matching for where to substitute.

[11:22] <erik``> And then build the resulting code simultaneously.

[20:36] <gfldex> There is right now no way to get a list of all type-objects, if that's what you are looking for.
