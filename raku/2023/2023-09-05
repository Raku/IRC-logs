[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> The point is the statement is too vague to begin with

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wouldn't say it's "too" vague

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it does have a clear point

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the approach Rust took is basically "easy, we just won't allow you to make mistakes", of course in this context the question isn't if your code is safe but if you can even do all the things required

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and it seems like there are people who say "no" to that question. I wouldn't know but it is indeed suspicious

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Is there a way to call Raku/Rakudo from node.js? I'm using a language that has a node.js integration inside of it, but not raku, so I'm trying to figure out how I could run a raku script and bring the results inside node.js

[17:21] <[Coke]> There is a JS backend for rakudo, but it is not actively maintained.

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I heard about that ya... I figured it would be too rudimentary since it was kind of abandonned a long time ago no? I could be wrong.

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you are basically right

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> frankly, the simplest thing would be to just invoke the process

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> now that there are unix domain sockets, you can do some async IPC hopefully

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's kind of a bleeding edge thing but I don't think it will magically mature without users

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Thanks Nemokosch. I will research that.

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> of course if it's overkill for your task, you don't have to do it, surely Node.js can launch processes and obtain their output

[17:31] <[Coke]> I just tried to build it, missing a dep locally.

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw - ++ on the Jupyter::ChatBook - I am working hard at getting a basic Dan::Polars to Jupyter and aim to "meet" you there soon

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Thanks. I am not sure what part of "Jupyter::Chatbook" should go into "Jupyter::Kernel", but I think there is a certain room for obscure but very useful extensions of "Jupyter::Kernel". For example: 1) Having meta cells that allow access to different data structures of the kernel 2) Ability to specify a list of package that loaded with each session. (E.g. "Dan::Polars".) 3) Always being able to connect

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> to Mermaid-Ink and be able to render the obtained images.
