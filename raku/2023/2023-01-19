[04:22] <ispyhumanfly> Hey all, are their any good/recommended CLI frameworks for Raku?

[04:22] <tellable6> 2023-01-18T19:33:38Z #raku <tonyo> ispyhumanfly no problem.  i have a fix for that bug in progress

[04:22] <tellable6> hey ispyhumanfly, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/33b390c3a9593b641ad4a663abab2213

[04:22] <ispyhumanfly> tonyo: Great, I'll grab the fix when ready.

[04:25] *** jpn joined
[04:29] <jaguart> not sure about CLI frameworks, but when I'm big I'm going to be like https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod

[04:31] <jaguart> I also quite like App::Mi6 - ala `my $app = App::Mi6::App.new; multi sub MAIN ... { $app.cmd('build') }` approach

[04:32] <ispyhumanfly> jaguart: haha

[14:51] <Homer_Simpson> how can I treat each line of a file as a separate array element

[14:51] <[Coke]> ... call .lines

[14:51] <Homer_Simpson> https://pastebin.com/Gc6XnMGL

[14:52] <[Coke]> again, .slurp gives you a single string including newlines; .lines gives you an array of lines;

[14:52] <[Coke]> you aren't calling .lines there, it's commented out

[14:53] <[Coke]> (this is the same thing we talked about yesterday)

[14:54] *** Altai-man joined
[14:54] <Homer_Simpson> ah ok thx

[14:55] <Homer_Simpson> yes I commented that bit out cause I thought slurp was needed, but replacing slurp with lines worked

[14:55] <Homer_Simpson> what does slurp do again, I know what chomp does

[14:56] <[Coke]> "slurps" the file into a variable: it takes all the contents and puts them in a single string.

[14:56] <Homer_Simpson> ohh

[14:56] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/routine/slurp

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> .lines doesn't give you an array. that you're assigning it to a @-sigiled thing reifies it, it being a lazy sequence that didn't fetch any lines until you asked, one way of which is @-sigiled assignment

[14:57] <[Coke]> yes, it's really a Seq. but it is a Positional. Was only contrasting vs. string.

[14:58] *** sena_kun left
[14:58] <[Coke]> Once we get String vs. Positional, we can drill down into types of array-like things.

[14:59] <[Coke]> m: dd $*ARGFILES.lines;

[15:02] <Homer_Simpson> how come it is reading the file from bottom to top

[15:04] <Homer_Simpson> https://pastebin.com/r7cbrZWk

[15:04] <Homer_Simpson> and I also gotta do lines(contents) + 1 for some reason

[15:06] <ugexe> for "data.ldr".IO.lines -> $line { say "This is line {$++} and its contents are: {$line}" }

[15:07] <ugexe> that is more idiomatic

[15:07] <Homer_Simpson> ok   loop (my $i = 0 ; $i < elems(@contents) ; $i++)

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or: for "data.ldr".IO.lines.kv -> $index, $line { say "This is line $index and its contents are: $line" }

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you can write C-ish code in Raku as well but there isn't much point. You are throwing away the benefits while keeping the downsides

[15:14] *** jpn left
[15:16] *** jpn joined
[15:23] <Homer_Simpson> ok that works too thx but it is still printing in reverse order

[15:23] <Homer_Simpson> its putting line 3's contents as line 0 

[15:24] <Homer_Simpson> err as line 1

[15:24] <Homer_Simpson> I could make the loop decrement but then its basically C again and its not how computers read files anyhow

[15:25] <ugexe> i think you're confused because nothing anyone has told you would read a file in reverse order

[15:25] *** TieUpYourCamel left
[15:25] <ugexe> you might want to reevaluate what you're doing, the contents of the file, or how much coffee you've had today

[15:26] <Homer_Simpson> ah oops ok thats how the file is

[20:44] <notna> Hi Rakoons. Who knows how the "Rakudo Star Bundle MacOS .dmg disk image file" on https://rakudo.org/star/macos was build in the past?

[20:44] <notna> Any script or "how-to" somewhere, which I could start from?

[20:57] *** jpn left
[21:06] <[Coke]> as one of the mac users, nope.

[21:06] <[Coke]> I typically build from scratch if doing dev or use rakubrew otherwise

[21:06] <[Coke]> sorry!

[23:48] <Homer_Simpson> anyone know how I can tweak the given condition so that it checks for a number followed by a space  because it is thinking 11 is line type 1: https://pastebin.com/GKPNRvs3

[23:51] *** codesections joined
[23:56] <Homer_Simpson> I sort of fixed it in a not very good way

[23:56] <Homer_Simpson> I made substr 0 to 2 and changed '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5'  to '0 ' '1 ' '2 ' '3 ' '4 ' '5 ' 

[23:59] <[Coke]> do you care about the spacing, or would:
