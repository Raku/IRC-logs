[09:09] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I think there's some rendering bug in IRC logs, for example here: https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2023-02-10.html#00:49

[09:10] *** squashable6 left
[09:10] <lizmat> yeah, that's the discord bot being naughty and splitting too long lines without prefixing the sender

[09:11] *** squashable6 joined
[09:12] <lizmat> if I remember correctly... or maybe the discord bot allowing strange nicks

[09:13] <lizmat> it's a rendering bug, not a logging bug, so when I get around to looking at that again, it will get fixed  :-)

[09:13] <lizmat> thanks for the nudge though  :-)

[09:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: can you change the default branch in whateverable repo to `main`?

[11:41] <Xliff> Seeking package names. My existing code is titled GLib. I know MM has the Gnome:: namespace locked up and don't want to step on his toes.

[11:41] <Xliff> So suggestions for a rename... and I'll have to postpone release until I can make the change for the module and test those changes.

[11:44] *** jpn left
[11:51] <lizmat> why is a rename necessary ?  What's wrong with GLib ?

[12:38] <Xliff> Mi6 keeps renaming my project to "GLib-Env" ... wonder why that is.

[12:41] <lizmat> you mean without the :: ?

[12:41] <lizmat> some filesystems don't like :: in filenames, I think that's why

[12:43] <Xliff> No. The ::Env is getting added.

[12:43] <Xliff> The project's name is GLib

[12:43] <Xliff> Not <A>::GLib (where <A> is Arbitrary) as I suspect.

[13:25] <ugexe> i wonder if we should include https://github.com/ugexe/Raku-CompUnit--Repository--Lib in the core and punt on handling how different file systems treat file names. on the one hand you wouldnt be able to have a module named like an emoji, or have A.rakumod and a.rakumod ""just work"" on a case insensitive file system (which technically won't work anyway because of e.g. extracting it to the file system

[13:25] <ugexe> before install). but installed modules would retain their original human readable names, the issue with native libraries that don't work when renamed would be fixed (like openssl on windows), and people could even install modules by just directly extracting an archive into a installation directory

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> is there some kind of known libssl issue or something? I'm trying to get Pastebin::Gist to work and it just doesn't. I'm using the example here: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Pastebin-Gist#synopsis

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> right now it just hangs on `$p.paste("<foo>bar</foo>")`

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> but before that I was getting Error 422: 422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV)

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> I know that this is not enough context, but maybe it rings a bell for someone

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> all I remember is that the token system changed or something

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> the old bot is working just fine with the same token, I'm trying to start it up in a docker container

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> I'm using rakudo-star image that is based on debian

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> I've just tried that same script locally and it works :(

[22:05] <ugexe> which version of openssl.so do you have

[22:06] <ugexe> like openssl 1.1.1 or whatever was EOL on september 11

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> in both cases OpenSSL 3.0.9 30 May 2023 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.9 30 May 2023)

[22:06] <ugexe> so its possible your system installed some major version that isnt compatible with raku openssl (which is based on the older major version)

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[22:07] <ugexe> i dunno if thats what is actually causing it, but i've been expecting that EOL to eventually break stuff in the raku ecosystem

[22:22] *** teatwo left
[22:23] <AlexDaniel> uhhh I'm seeing something completely weird. If the access token is right, then `$p.paste("hello world")` hangs indefinitely

[22:24] <AlexDaniel> the script itself mostly keeps running, I tried `start loop { sleep 1; say "hello" };` and that seems to work

[22:29] <coleman> Maybe try adding a newline, e.g. "<foo>bar</foo>\n"

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> that doesn't help, no. I'm now waiting with a hope that there is actually a timeout of sorts

[22:35] <AlexDaniel> and it's not just hanging

[22:36] <AlexDaniel> oh, it's using 100% cpu, nice

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> ok dammit, but it's in docker so I must have a neat reproduction‚Ä¶ let's see‚Ä¶

[22:51] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I can reproduce it

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> perhaps you don't even need docker to reproduce

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> sorry, rakudo-star 2022.12 is a potato, please ignore it

[23:40] <AlexDaniel> broken in 2023.04

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> good=2023.02, bad=2023.04 ‚Äì that's as far as I can bisect right now

[23:41] *** guifa joined
[23:42] <AlexDaniel> pinning whateverable to 2023.02 for now‚Ä¶ hopefully that'll allow me to move forward

[23:43] <coleman> Cool. An strace on the container build seems to indicate a low-level network/poll issue
