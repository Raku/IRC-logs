[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa I usually do ($m - $m % $d, $m % $d)  . (Not very elegant, but quick enough.)

[01:19] <guifa> Anton: yeah, I guess I should have stated when I mean efficient I meant performant haha.

[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @cf Works with camels too  say 21.base("camel")  :  🐫🐪🐫🐪🐫 .

[01:21] <guifa> btw Anton, I released the Intl::Format::Number, currently handles percentages, permillages, and most all numbers

[01:21] <guifa> I'm working to add in support for significant figures and exponential numbers (the latter requires the former)

[01:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa I noticed! (Liz mentioned it in the rakudoweekly.) I have hard installing those packages without errors on my computer. But once installed, they seem to work fine.

[01:23] <guifa> Anton: if you get any errors, definitely let me know.  Probably the issue was the requirement for Intl::CLDR:ver<0.4.2>, I had issues uploading that.  I submitted a PR for fez to fix the issue though so now it should be available

[01:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Ok, will do.

[01:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Mathematica has the functions QuotientReminder   ( https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/QuotientRemainder.html ) , so I thought (for some reason) that Raku would have a similar function.

[01:25] <cfa> i just tried installing Intl::Format::Number and got an error too

[01:25] <guifa> cfa: what's the error?

[01:25] <cfa> it's from the User::Language test; i think there's a missing dependency declaration

[01:25] * guifa sometimes has stray extra old modules laying around and it silently borks installs

[01:26] <cfa> Could not find Intl::LanguageTag:ver<0.12+>:auth<zef:guifa> in ...

[01:26] <cfa> hmm, but above that: ===> Testing [OK] for Intl::LanguageTag:ver<0.12.2>:auth<zef:guifa>

[01:26] <guifa> that's.....weird

[01:26] <cfa> anyway, the error is from UserLanguage/lib/User/Language.rakumod

[01:27] <cfa> guifa: https://gist.github.com/cfa/b69d8d7a52beec176dff1643a24a2f57

[01:28] <guifa> huh, I wonder if the issue is that I need to have it be :ver<0.12.2+>

[01:28] <cfa> oh, do you need a test-depends?

[01:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes, same here -- errors while installing because " Intl::LanguageTag" cannot be found. (Just tried it.)

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see the same messages as @cfa .

[01:30] <cfa> hmm

[01:31] <cfa> this is odd

[01:32] <guifa> I wonder if during the install/testing it's somehow treating the dependency (left as 0.12.1+) is somehow being treated different from 0.12+, so when it's running things it doesn't realize that they're one and the same

[01:33] <guifa> let me try uploading to fez again

[01:35] <guifa> okay, I just sent a new copy to fez

[01:35] <guifa> set all the dependencies to 0.12.2+ for User::Language

[01:37] <cfa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/UserLanguage/blob/master/META6.json#L11

[01:37] <cfa> this reads auth:<zef:guifa>

[01:38] <cfa> rather than auth<zef:guifa>

[01:38] <guifa> wooooow

[01:38] <guifa> I knew it'd be a stupid typo somewhere

[01:38] <cfa> not sure whether that's the cause but seems a good candidate

[01:38] <guifa> I just uploaded a new new version with that typo fixed :-)

[01:48] <ugexe> rf: force fetch just continues to the next step if fetching fails, which almost always won’t work 

[01:48] <ugexe> I dunno why a slow connection would matter though

[01:49] <ugexe> maybe try —fetch-timeout=6000 if it’s a timeout issue 

[01:49] <rf> I have satellite internet, for some reason on packages with a large number of deps (Cro stuff typically), it blows up with fetch errors and I have to try 50+ times until its installed

[01:51] <ugexe> Yeah but it’s just calling curl, which I imagine works fine manually 

[01:52] <ugexe> oh actually

[01:52] <rf> Yeah, not sure why its breaking.

[01:52] <ugexe> try --fetch-degree=1

[01:52] <ugexe> i forgot that defaults to 5

[01:53] <ugexe> if that works you can set an env var to change the default -- https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/5345b9183928184aea9cd9cf6d26a057039d5df9/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod#L124

[01:53] <rf> I'll test it out thanks!

[02:01] <rf> Seems to have worked thanks a lot!

[02:01] <rf> What does fetch-degree do?

[02:01] <Voldenet> if you use satellite internet, consider vpn over tcp

[02:01] <Voldenet> it's laggy as hell, but reliable

[02:02] <rf> I use a VPN for work, but not personally. My internet isn't too bad just cuts out every 3-4 hours for a few seconds

[02:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa I can install "Intl::CLDR" without errors. I get errors trying to install  "Intl::Format::Number".  I get "Error while importing from 'experimental': no such tag 'rakuast'"

[02:50] <guifa> aaaah you need to update Rakudo then, as your version doesn't have rakuast support (I think that begins with 2022.12)

[02:50] * guifa will add more information to the readme

[02:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Well, my version is "moar-2022.12"...

[02:53] <guifa> If you're getting the message `no such tag rakuast` on experimental, then it's just an older version.  You maybe have one that's like a few days before the big merge happened

[02:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok, I will experiment with that some other time.

[13:19] <[Coke]> Anton - as someone who works on the docs, having a list of missing things will definitely help us fix things eventually - we have a small number of authors and basically zero editors; so we can probably get someone to write up a known missing thing but not review a document for what's missing

[13:20] <[Coke]> bot people, maybe an "ENODOC" chat function that threw a note somewhere for the docs people to track.

[13:21] <[Coke]> I would have expected, btw, that you can only have one proto with a given name.

[13:21] <[Coke]> Since I thought protos were also defining minimum required signatures, as well as function bodies.

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://gist.github.com/2colours/0b6f4611360746f33ff82462ff79787e

[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a simple extension of the doc example - the supposed proto method does nothing

[13:27] <[Coke]> ah. protos at the method level, do those work with the name:thing syntax? 

[13:27] <[Coke]> (as opposed to the proto in the rule, which does)

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh okay, the font is different

[14:06] <grondilu> I see them identical 

[14:06] <rf> Font is client side

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes and no but anyway, it is the same

[14:08] <grondilu> I didn't know chr could be used beyond ASCII.

[14:09] <lizmat> yes... it basically should be called .grapheme I guess

[14:09] <lizmat> and .ord should be called .codepoint  :)

[20:13] <shmup> what's up cfa, unsure what you're asking with that line hehe

[20:13] <shmup> cfa when you replace the script, you could /unload script-name and /load script-name. i forget. i'd do that

[20:15] <cfa> shmup: the line ends with `$targe`

[20:15] <shmup> ahhhHHhhHHHH

[20:16] <shmup> okay pushed, bumped version. /script shows you what's loaded which can be nice to verify after you unload. i wish it showed the version though :)

[20:16] <shmup> thanks cfa i have no excuse for that besides nvr let me be in charge of code reviews ;)

[20:46] <cfa> shmup: (re)loaded

[20:51] <cfa> hmm

[20:54] <cfa> zef is installing an older version (0.2.2) of GTK::Simple -- i believe because this is the most recent in the zef ecosystem, even though a newer version (0.2.4) was published by lizmat to the REA

[20:54] <cfa> will zef always prefer the most recent in its own ecosystem before considering REA?

[20:55] <cfa> zef is installing GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.2>:auth<zef:finanalyst>

[20:59] *** jpn joined
[21:02] <[Coke]> what's your command line to the installer?

[21:02] <[Coke]> if it's some other thing, you have to check if this is pinned at a specific version as a prereq to some other module

[22:00] <cfa> [Coke]: zef install GTK::Simple, zef look GTK::Simple, zef info GTK::Simple

[22:00] <cfa> (after zef update)

[22:01] <cfa> so, not a declared dependency -- a direct install

[22:01] <cfa> i'll try uninstalling then reinstalling shortly (i'm between meetings right now)

[22:01] <lizmat> fwiw, uploads to the REA are automated

[22:05] *** squashable6 left
[22:07] <cfa> can anyone here try: $ zef --update info GTK::Simple | grep Identity

[22:07] <cfa> and let me know what it reports?

[22:08] *** squashable6 joined
[22:09] <guifa> - Identity: GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.4>:auth<zef:finanalyst>

[22:10] <ugexe> yes, with the default config zef will prefer distributions in fez

[22:11] <ugexe> otherwise you could do `zef install GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.4>` and it'll have to look at REA to find it

[22:11] *** jpn joined
[22:12] <cfa> and if i uninstall GTK::Simple, would it install 0.2.2 again?

[22:12] <cfa> guifa's result suggests not

[22:12] <cfa> (uninstall, then reinstall that is)

[22:12] <ugexe> I see Identity: GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.2>:auth<zef:finanalyst>

[22:13] <ugexe> just do `zef install GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.4>`

[22:13] <ugexe> or `zef info "zef install GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.4>"` to see its info

[22:14] <ugexe> er, `zef info "GTK::Simple:ver<0.2.4>"`

[22:37] *** freeside joined
[22:39] <cfa> sure

[22:40] <cfa> but the installation of 0.2.2 instead of 0.2.4 when the version number wasn't supplied is what surprised me

[22:40] <cfa> (i'm unclear on whether the issue was local state in my repository or something else)

[22:41] *** freeside left
[22:42] <cfa> i think it's my repo

[22:43] <cfa> hmm

[22:44] *** jpn left
[22:44] <cfa> GTK::Simple is uninstalled but after an update, info is still reporting 0.2.2

[22:45] <ugexe> yes, that is correct

[22:45] <ugexe> that is the version on fez, and "...with the default config zef will prefer distributions in fez"

[22:45] <cfa> ah okay, i didn't realise that was confirmed -- thanks

[22:46] <cfa> and guifa is seeing 0.2.4 because that's been separately installed with a version number?

[22:46] <cfa> ugexe: sorry, i'd overlooked your reply 

[22:46] <ugexe> we won't know without the 'Recommended By:' line

[22:47] <ugexe> i imagine they already had fetched or installed it at some point

[22:49] <cfa> and an older version of zef might find and install 0.2.4 when invoked with `zef install GTK::Simple` because it wouldn't be checking fez (first), right?

[22:49] <ugexe> yeah, although it would have to be like a year or so old

[22:50] <cfa> yeah this is rakudo from debian with whatever version of zef that was

[22:52] <cfa> and ideally, GTK::Simple 0.2.4 should be deployed to fez

[22:53] *** jmcgnh left
[22:54] <ugexe> Oct 2021 is when it was changed

[22:55] <ugexe> v0.13.0

[22:55] <cfa> aha; on that debian box it's v0.9.4

[22:56] <cfa> and i've manually installed 0.2.4 on this box fwiw 

[22:56] *** jpn joined
[22:56] <ugexe> a zef that old is still good for one thing: installing a newer version of zef

[23:22] <rf> How would I run some code on module import time

[23:22] *** codesections joined
[23:26] <guifa> I forget exactly when the code gets run for modules declared with module Foo { class foo is export {…} }, but if you use sub EXPORT() I believe all the code in there runs for each import statement

[23:26] <rf> Cool, thanks!

[23:26] *** jpn left
[23:28] <rf> Nice that worked like a charm.

[23:30] <guifa> (that can definitely be a good thing or a gotcha, depending haha)

[23:32] <rf> I want to export a dynamic variable at import time is my goal

[23:33] <rf> Not sure if this is working as good as I thought it would...

[23:40] *** jpn joined
[23:47] <guifa> Ah I think I remember trying that, can't remember if I managed to pull it off
