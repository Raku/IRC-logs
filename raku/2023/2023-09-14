[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ good question, I would like to test drive also (is there eg a 30 day trial?)
[12:54] <tbrowder__> lizmat: i'm getting a failure with your module 'are' on a debian 11 VM with an installed raku 'v2020.22' (it's the debian latest, ugh). would you expect that for such an old version (i hope so)?
[12:55] <lizmat> lemme check
[12:55] *** jpn joined
[12:56] <tbrowder__> it's on digital ocean, btw
[12:56] <lizmat> what's the error ?\
[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder and @librasteve On getting and using Mathematica (in general): 1) Download Mathematica’s trial versions (I think it is 14 days) 2) Buy Mathematica Home Edition (I think it is less than $200) (in some promotions is ≈$150) 3) Get the Wolfram Engine — it is free for developers (requires registration with email)
[13:01] *** jpn left
[13:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The free for developers Wolfram Engine (WE) can be used with Jupyter. I.e. there is a Wolfram Language Jupyter kernel.
[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Raku can connect to the Wolfram Engine via “Proc::ZMQed”.
[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Alternatively, Raku can be used in Mathematica notebooks via the paclet “RakuMode”.
[13:03] <lizmat> tbrowder_: I don't see anything in the "are" code itself that could cause any problems
[13:03] <tbrowder__> sorry, i will have to tell you later..,happened earlier this am and  something changed in my fumbling
[13:05] *** jpn joined
[13:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I discuss using Wolfram Engine (Mathematica) in Raku here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWeGkJU3wdM
[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder For the other way around — using Raku in Mathematica — I made this paclet : https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/RakuMode/
[13:12] <tbrowder__> hm, does Jupyter have a raku kernel?
[13:12] <tbrowder__> didn't see one.
[13:13] <tbrowder__> replit.com does
[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Yes, there are two Raku packages that provide a Raku kernel for Jupyter: 1) "Jupyter::Kernel", 2) "Jupyter::Chatbook" . The latter is based on the former.
[13:16] <tbrowder__> thanks!
[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For the Raku in Mathematica connection ("RakuMode") I used "Text::CodeProcessing" which borrows heavily from "Jupyter::Kernel". (Written by Brian Duggan.)
[13:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Related, I plan to make another "Jupyter::Chatbook" demo movie today.
[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder and @librasteve You might find this Reddit discussion interesting: https://www.reddit.com/r/Mathematica/comments/12kkss4/rakumode_wolfram_language_paclet_repository/

[19:48] <[Coke]> sub baz is native(LIBBAR) { * } - why does this *invoke* a raku sub LIBBAR?

[20:56] <ugexe> because you can pass a Callable to `native(...)` 
[20:56] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/cfcf9fb3e931d6932c05726a8a2fbc2a11f49447/lib/NativeCall.rakumod#L220-L222
[20:56] <ugexe> although if there isn't an actual LIBBAR callable then yeah that would be strange

[21:22] <tbrowder__> ugexe: can you add that use of zef you showed us for testing to the zef README?
[21:25] <tbrowder__> lizmat: i've revisited File::Copy and think i can make it work. the original intent was to demo doing it in core but that was a disaster, i should have made a PR in core. now i'm making an exported sub 'cp' instead.
