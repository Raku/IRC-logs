[00:04] *** lichtkind left
[00:04] <rf> It does exactly what I was envisioning :D
[00:20] <ugexe> something that may be worth adding is they should put "Distribution::Builder::Cmake" as a build-depends
[00:23] <Homer_Simpson> @lizmat
[00:23] <ugexe> some more docs on the Distribution::Builder:: stuff as well are contained in the pod of https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/DistributionBuilder.rakumod fwiw

[00:33] *** dogbert11 left
[00:50] <ugexe> of course with Distribution::Builder::Cmake you are hard coupling to cmake, whereas Distribution::Builder::MakeFromJSON will try to use whatever variant of make you have (...I think)
[00:51] <ugexe> like on windows systems i generally only have nmake available

[16:25] *** buffet joined
[16:25] <Homer_Simpson> you dont need to backscroll
[16:25] <Homer_Simpson> it was just the same question as we were talking about yesterday
[16:26] <lizmat> I thought I answered it, what was wrong with the answer ?
[16:27] <Homer_Simpson> it prints 1 6 3 8 5 10
[16:27] <Homer_Simpson> (yes not on newlines and it removes the spaces)
[16:28] <Homer_Simpson> my $fp = open "data.ldr", :r;
[16:28] <Homer_Simpson> my @aaaa = $fp.lines.map(*.split(" ").List);
[16:28] <Homer_Simpson> print(@aaaa);
[16:29] <Homer_Simpson> doing print(@aaaa); should print the following EXACTUALLY:
[16:29] <Homer_Simpson> 1 6
[16:29] <Homer_Simpson> 3 8
[16:29] <Homer_Simpson> 5 10
[16:30] <Homer_Simpson> doing print(@aaaa[0][0]); should print 1, doing print(@aaaa[0][1]); should print a space and doing print(@aaaa[0][]); should print 1 6
[16:32] <Homer_Simpson> @aaaa is the same as @aaaa[][]
[16:33] <Homer_Simpson> and it should not print 3 spaces when the file only has 1
[16:34] <Homer_Simpson> inbetween 1 and 6 for example
[16:36] <lizmat> when you call print on @a, it *stringifies* the array
[16:36] <lizmat> each element in turn also gets stringified
[16:36] <lizmat> stringifications are joined by a space
[16:37] <lizmat> my @a = <a b c>; print @a
[16:37] <Homer_Simpson> is there something like print that does not do that
[16:37] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar d52342eb0: OUTPUT: «a b c»
[16:37] <lizmat> nothing to do with print, it has to do with stringification of arrays
[16:38] <Homer_Simpson> put is also doing it
[16:38] <Homer_Simpson> idk why its to hard to do this in raku
[16:38] <[Coke]> you can do @array.join('') if you want to do the stringification yourself with nospace between elements.
[16:39] <[Coke]> m: my @a = <a b c>; say @a; say @a.join('');
[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar d10c27506: OUTPUT: «[a b c]␤abc␤»

[19:00] <rf> Yeah that is planned

[19:01] <rf> Yes absolutely :D

[20:38] <rf> Maybe make Mi6 install with zef, then alias zef test and zef build as just mi6 test and mi6 build

[21:05] <tonyo> zef itself would stay the installer and would stay away from anything fez is doing, fez would be the dist manager
[21:05] <tonyo> i'm hesitant to rely on mi6 for anything and would prefer to keep fez dep free
[21:05] <rf> Oh, I didn't know Mi6 was like this sorry.
[21:07] <rf> I guess we are at a crossroads then for zef
[21:07] <tonyo> in what way?
[21:08] <tonyo> fez would be the dist manager as far as uploading and sending to _ecosystem_, never on the install size
[21:09] <rf> What is your final vision for zef?
[21:10] <rf> I see that you want to add bundling deployment etc, so would it be like NPM for raku? Or more just focused on packages?

[23:25] <NemokoschKiwi> bruh, the bridge doesn't get the strikethrough through in any way
[23:26] <NemokoschKiwi> anyway, the sentiment was that using Mac is kind of problematic per se 🤷‍♂️
[23:27] <ugexe> i doubt their problems have anything to do with using a Mac
[23:27] <NemokoschKiwi> well, it's a more fundamental problem tbh
[23:27] <NemokoschKiwi> rf: I can be wrong but perhaps the only person who can give a useful answer to that is finanalyst at the moment
[23:27] <hackyhacker> It works with rakubrew
[23:27] <cfa> good stuff
[23:28] <rf> Another +1 for rakubrew
[23:28] <ugexe> that sounds like a fundamentalist opinion
[23:28] <rf> I will not stop recommending it
[23:29] <ugexe> i'd wager the problem was they were installing rakudo star (which i dont think anyone has released recently) + getting raku off a package manager (usually the version they have is very dated)
[23:29] <cfa> hmm, looks like the current comma plugin isn't compatible with the latest idea
[23:30] <NemokoschKiwi> The Raku community is kind of fundamentalist tbh, it's sad that we cannot be at least consistent about "any decision is politics"
[23:31] <hackyhacker> No I think the problem was Mac related. The finder window that popped up when trying to select an SDK wouldn't let me navigate to root.
[23:31] <cfa> cmd-shift-g didn't provide you with a location prompt?
[23:31] <hackyhacker> oh let me try that
[23:31] <cfa> i think that works in open dialogs
[23:32] <hackyhacker> Ah yes that works
[23:32] <cfa> \o/
[23:32] <cfa> though i'm surprised you can't browse to root graphically
[23:33] <ugexe> i cant believe the brew formula for rakudo star is 2022.12
[23:33] <NemokoschKiwi> Rakudo Star got resurrected at some point iirc
[23:33] <ugexe> its been resurrected and abandoned many times
[23:33] <ugexe> i thought we were on another abandoned cycle
[23:33] <NemokoschKiwi> but not sure how much it is actually stable
[23:34] <ugexe> it doesn't really make sense tbh
[23:34] <NemokoschKiwi> seems like most people moved away at some point
[23:34] <ugexe> who is curating those modules for example
[23:34] <ugexe> i think its just the same stuff from X years ago
[23:34] <hackyhacker> Have you guys worked professionally with perl/raku or only hobby?
[23:35] <NemokoschKiwi> the user base is weirdly divided on Rakudo installation methods tbh
[23:35] <NemokoschKiwi> I can also only say that rakubrew never disappointed me
[23:36] <NemokoschKiwi> hackyhacker: perhaps pure Raku jobs aren't really a thing but for scripting stuff you can kind of inject it into work tasks, that's what I'm also doing
[23:37] <NemokoschKiwi> (unfortunately one of my scripts got into the hands of someone who doesn't seem to care about the code any further than "worked for me", lol)
