[00:49] <El_Che> let's dial it down

[00:50] <guifa> In fun news, I think I finally got a grammar working for basically single passing parsing CLDR number patterns

[00:51] <guifa> and I've got about 50% of the RakuAST written to use that data to actually format numbers

[00:52] <guifa> OTOH I feel dirty looping in so much action-like stuff into the grammar, OTOH, the grammar should still be fully usable by another actions class, since it just sets some dynamic variables that shouldnt' get in the way

[00:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Sounds interesting! Where that code can be found? (Or you are just keeping it for yourself, like some other projects?)

[00:54] <guifa> I can post it in a gist for now, I'll actually post to github probably tomorrow when I finish the formatter code

[00:56] *** jaguart joined

[00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa Ok. I wrote a random sentence generator that used grammar classes a few weeks before you and Liz published documents about RakuAST. Now I am curious can I / should I re-write that generator to use RakuAST.

[07:06] <Homer_Simpson> I still want  to be able to increment characters in raku

[07:06] <tellable6> 2022-12-31T12:17:12Z #raku <guifa> Homer_Simpson: sub circumfix:<` `> (Str() $foo) {¬†$foo.comb }; my @a  = `'abc'`; say @a

[07:12] <Homer_Simpson> sub circumfix:<``> (Str() $foo) {comb($foo);}; my @a = `'abc'`; say(@a);

[07:13] <Homer_Simpson> Not enough symbols provided for categorical of type circumfix; needs 2

[07:15] <Homer_Simpson> oh wait

[07:15] <Homer_Simpson> my client removed the fucking grave accent again

[07:15] <Homer_Simpson> oh wat, no, it did not this time

[07:16] *** bigdata joined
[07:17] <Homer_Simpson> this looks promising though @guifa

[07:18] <Homer_Simpson> wait is that user a bot, or is tellable a bot

[07:18] <Homer_Simpson> or am I really a bot

[07:21] <Voldenet> we're all bots ‚Äì we use certain algorithms to consume input impulses and produce output ones

[07:22] <Voldenet> jokes aside, tellable6 is a bot

[07:23] <Voldenet> Homer_Simpson: .comb is not suitable for incrementing, because arithmetics are probably not supposed to work on characters

[07:23] <Voldenet> you want to increment numerical representation

[07:24] <Voldenet> m: my $input = Buf.new: "abcde".encode("ascii"); $input[$input.first(* < 0x7e, :end, :k)]++; say $input.decode("ascii")

[07:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar ddecbe687: OUTPUT: ¬´abcdf‚ê§¬ª

[07:25] <Voldenet> (that incrementing would need to be more sophisticated, but I'm not sure if it'd fit in one line

[07:25] <Voldenet> but you'd have to walk through every element in the buffer and handle carryover flag for all of them

[07:25] <Homer_Simpson> care to put that in a function thats easy to call/

[07:25] <Voldenet> in the worst case, it'd need to allocate something)

[07:26] <Voldenet> but the above is something like cstring

[07:27] <Homer_Simpson> I do know that raku can use ++ on string literals and string literal constants

[07:27] <Homer_Simpson> but thats hardly useful 

[07:28] <Homer_Simpson> how do I email larry wall asking him to give us what im asking for

[07:41] <jaguart> His alias is Morph - so you loudly say 'Allomorph' and then read this? https://docs.raku.org/type/Allomorph

[07:41] <jaguart> It doesn't all .succ

[07:44] <Homer_Simpson> I basically wanted a language that can read an LDRAW script file and then figure out where group of parts can be replaced with fewer parts that do the same thing

[07:48] <Homer_Simpson> like three stacked 1x1 plates == one 1x1 brick, two stacked 1x1 plates = one 1x1 slab, two colums of three stacked 1x1 plates = 1x2 brick etc

[07:51] <Homer_Simpson> of course it would have paramaters that I can specify which changes how it matches different part groups

[07:52] <Homer_Simpson> if I can get that working im fairly sure I can extend the language so that it can also build stuff from scratch rather than optimize an existing LDRAW model

[07:52] <jaguart> maybe you could write a generator that generates a reasonably exhausitive list of contractions, and then search your scripts for places where these can be applied? not familiar with LDRAW scripts - assuming you mean something other than lua.

[07:54] <Homer_Simpson> I could if I only kept the 'pool' of parts to basic part types

[07:54] <Homer_Simpson> because theres probably as many ways to combine every type of lego brick as there are stars in the universe!

[07:56] <Homer_Simpson> ldraw is basically a CAD program for LEGO

[13:19] <Neo4469> what language is faster? Perl 5 or Raku?

[13:24] <Voldenet> faster to write, execute or what

[13:26] <Neo4469> execute

[13:26] <Voldenet> perl5 most likely, depends on the code

[13:28] <Voldenet> tbh. from both languages the fastest you can get is just executing C code

[13:28] <Voldenet> so there's always escape hatch if you need additional performance

[13:35] <Voldenet> but raku's perf keeps improving rapidly

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there are improvements definitely

[13:38] <Voldenet> there's a lot more room for improvements, because the interpreter itself is younger

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh okay

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> have you done other programming languages? to help with terminology

[22:53] <pippo> well I am a beginner.

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you know, the essential difference between a method and a subroutine is that a method is invoked on a certain object. How this is done kinda differs from language to language

[22:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in Raku, the object is passed as the "zeroeth argument"; if you don't do anything in particular, you can access it as `self`

[22:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not 100% but maybe decontainerized `self`

[22:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> however, you can specify this "zeroeth argument" in front of the colon

[22:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so in your example, $value refers to your object itself
