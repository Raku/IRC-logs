[14:03] <coleman> what I like about the grep use case is it's a good test for performance improvements and regression 
[14:08] <tonyo> i mean constructive feedback outside of the tool itself, the comments about PR or marketing are pretty explicit in saying "i need more to give it a try"

[14:47] <ugexe> I wonder how much time is spent in GC for App::Raku and if it would make sense to have an option to disable GC altogether (if that is even possible)

[17:48] <Guest5> hi, it seems that .minpairs used to return a Seq, it now returns a List (2023.08+). I think returning a List is better because it cannot lazily generate the values anyway. Documentation still says returns Seq. What could be done for this

[18:19] <[Coke]> You could open a ticket or a PR on github.com/raku/doc, that would be great.
[18:20] <[Coke]> if there's an appropriate role or something that the spec tests are checking for, we should say that instead of the specific, we'll check

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ugexe: i doubt that GC is material - my intuition is that 80% of Rak are short running ... so GC will not start ... for the rest you are in the 5GB logfile territory that ripgrep serves ... and I suspect that Rak for large cases like this will need some GC to avoid filling memory...
[23:25] <ugexe> the mmap enabled query of rg used 700ish MB of memory
[23:25] <ugexe> that is why i was wondering
[23:26] <ugexe> if it is significantly faster than it might not matter if it uses more memory
