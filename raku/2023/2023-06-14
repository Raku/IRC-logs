[00:09] <[Coke]> Why are you asking me that question?
[00:09] <[Coke]> emphasis on me
[00:41] <tonyo> hey all, fez v52 just uploaded.  i thought i'd shipped it a week or two ago but it turns out i didn't.  a lot of the depends stuff is fixed in that, next version will have it added back and enabled _only when AST is available_ and hopefully working better 
[00:46] <tonyo> is finanalyst in irc?
[00:52] <[Coke]> not usually

[13:19] <leont> Converted a piece of code from regex concatenation to RakuAST, and it turns out to be slower in the test. I'm guessing this means regex compilation is faster than AST evaluation and not a runtime issue, but it's still surprising.

[21:09] <guifa_> leont: interesting.  I think the regex RakuAST stuff is some of the more recent bits, so little to no optimization
[21:11] <tonyo> got fez working mostly with finding depends with rakuast, it doesn't seem to like dynamic `require`s yet though so a little difficulty testing correctness
