[15:49] <Xliff> lizmat: OK. Where is the best place for raku blogs?

[15:49] <lizmat> dev.to ?

[15:49] <Xliff> Ah. I'll need to get an account there. Thanks.

[16:21] <Xliff> lizmat: https://dev.to/xliff/using-a-supply-to-track-the-number-of-items-in-a-box-3d1b

[16:22] <Xliff> Still needs the conclusion....

[16:29] <Voldenet> Xliff: are you absolutely sure that this code is thread safe?

[16:29] <Xliff> No.

[16:29] <Voldenet> probably access to the $bonus needs a lock

[16:29] <Xliff> There is an attempt to use locking.

[16:30] <Xliff> True. But for my  purposes.... it's irrelevant.

[16:30] <Xliff> Please mention that in the comments when it goes up.

[16:31] <Xliff> Adding in any discussion about thread safety would muddy the issue.

[16:31] <lizmat> Xliff: why the BUILD method ?

[16:31] <Xliff> lizmat: That's because it's there in Supply-factories.pm6

[16:32] <Xliff> So I just adjusted the source for Suppy.interval to taste.

[16:34] <lizmat> also, why augment Supply?   why not create a sub ?

[16:35] <Xliff> Because I didn't know how to do it with a sub. Using a sub does not imply nor promote reusability, and this also points out a missed opportunity with Supply.interval.

[16:35] <lizmat> well, apart from that, but augmenting means you can't precompile

[16:36] <Xliff> This is how Supply.interval was implemented. I'm using the same technique Rakudo itself uses to add Supply.interval.

[16:36] <lizmat> sub interval-with-value( $interval, $value, $delay = 0, :$scheduler = $*SCHEDULER)

[16:36] <lizmat>   

[16:37] <lizmat> that may be so, but augment outside of the core, is a very heavy thing to do

[16:37] <Xliff> I prefer it this way.

[16:37] <lizmat> ok, just my 2c  :-)

[16:38] <Xliff> If you want to make that argument, it can be done in the comments. :-)

[16:38] <Xliff> Your 2c is more like a quarter, but is best for further discussion, yes?

[16:38] <lizmat> sure

[16:39] <Voldenet> meh, dev.to requires too much effort to comment, but it's not relevant anyway

[16:39] <lizmat> you can also comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/12whgd1/using_a_supply_to_track_the_number_of_items_in_a/

[16:44] <Voldenet> otoh, I'm curious why not just do `Supply.interval(2).map({ [42, $++] })`

[17:01] <Voldenet> it's nice because it automatically creates a scope and it's very likely to be thread safe in scenario like:

[17:01] <Voldenet> m: my $var = 42; react { whenever Supply.interval(.1).map({ [$var, $++] }).head(5) { .say }; whenever Promise.in(.1) { $var = -1; }}

[17:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7267e7f1b: OUTPUT: «[42 0]␤[-1 1]␤[-1 2]␤[-1 3]␤[-1 4]␤»

[17:08] <Xliff> Voldnet: Huh! Not bad.

[17:08] <Xliff> I'm not so well versed in react/whenever so that solution did not occur to me.

[17:10] <Xliff> Voldenet: How well does that .map work with .tap?

[17:10] <Voldenet> .map emits MapSupply

[17:11] <Xliff> And that means... ?

[17:11] <Voldenet> It works like a normal tap would

[17:11] <Xliff> OK, great!

[17:14] <Voldenet> Hmm, I'm still not entirely sure about thread safety of setting var and reading it the way I did - since emit may run before or after $var is changed

[17:17] <Voldenet> lock would make it clearer

[18:27] <rf> In Rakudo's source, where is `Supply.interval` declared?

[18:36] <lizmat> src/core.c/Supply-factories.pm6 line 79

[18:37] <rf> Thanks!

[18:37] <rf> Also https://dev.to/rawleyfowler/functional-programming-with-raku-9ib, had to rush a bit I have family coming so ping me with spelling mistakes or anything :D

[18:40] <lizmat> rf I think you forgot WhateverCode as an anonymous function

[18:41] <lizmat> my &add = * + *

[18:41] <rf> Ah good catch!

[18:41] <rf> I'm not going to cover it completely but I will make sure to mention it

[18:43] <rf> lizmat++

[19:14] <Xliff>  Can you create a REPL<CStruct> class at runtime?

[19:16] <lizmat> I don't see why not?

[19:16] <lizmat> it would be BEGIN time inside the EVAL ?

[19:17] <Xliff> No. In a sub using the HOW

[19:19] <lizmat> I suggest write your class, then feed that Str to .AST and say the result.  If that produces valid RakuAST code, that would be a way to go about it

[19:25] <Xliff> lizmat: So you do NOT recommend using ^add_method and .^add_attribute?
