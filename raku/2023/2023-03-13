[09:17] <grondilu> LAST allows to execute code at the last iteration of the loop, but is there a way to execute code at each iteration BUT the last one?

[09:17] <tellable6> 2023-03-07T22:47:24Z #raku <guifa> grondilu: in fact, I'm working on a code tidier that's based on RakuAST nodes.  It's still very basic now, but while core should only provide rudimentary node to string capabilities, moduels are a great place to do even more

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, how do you know (more accurately, when do you know) that an iteration is the last one?

[09:19] *** BabyLoveWoodrose joined
[09:20] <grondilu> "I don't know" (with screen-rant tone)

[09:20] <grondilu> (or rather pitch meeting)

[09:21] <grondilu> Anyway, looking at the doc, NEXT might do the job

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> idk what they are

[09:21] * grondilu tries it

[09:21] <grondilu> Nemokosch:  nevermind I was trying to be quirky

[09:21] *** BabyLoveWoodrose left
[09:21] <tellable6> grondilu, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[09:22] <grondilu> hum, nope.  NEXT will also run at the last iteration.

[09:23] <dakkar> grondilu: do you need your code to run at the beginning of each iteration, or at the end?

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's what I kinda tried to approach - you wouldn't know what the last iteration was in general, without trying to start over

[09:24] <grondilu> I want the code to run at each iteration but the last one.

[09:25] <dakkar> "at" is not precise enough…

[09:25] <grondilu> I mean LAST knows what the last iteration is, so why can't I define "not LAST" or something?

[09:25] <grondilu> dakkar: oh sorry I see what you mean now.

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but like, do you understand the theoretical limits?

[09:25] <dakkar> m: for 1..1 { say "loop"; LAST say "last" }

[09:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 166e16683: OUTPUT: «loop␤last␤»

[09:26] *** Vyrus joined
[09:26] <dakkar> it can't do "last" before running the block for the last time

[09:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that you need to at least attempt to start the next iteration to know that the previous one was the last one?

[09:26] <dakkar> (of course it could in this very trivial example, but in general it can't)

[09:28] <dakkar> I guess `for … { …; LAST { something } }` is pretty much `do { for … { … }; LEAVE { something } }`

[09:28] <dakkar> or just `{ for … { … }; something }`

[09:28] <dakkar> (with different names visible, of course)

[09:32] <grondilu> I think using a phaser was a bad idea.  I'll do something like `for @array { do-this; do-that unless ++$ == @array; }`

[09:33] <grondilu> not very elegant but oh well.

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it sounds kinda interesting that you need to do something like that at all

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> won't work through discord :c

[09:35] <grondilu> Nemokosch:  if you're curious, I'm trying to display an image on the terminal using kitty's protocol.  I have to split the image data in chunks, and print it with a specific code for each chunks but the last one.

[09:35] <tellable6> grondilu, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[09:36] <lizmat> grondilu: LAST does *not* know it's the last iteration.  

[09:36] <lizmat> the LAST phaser gets run *after* the iterator was exhausted, but still inside the scope of the loop body

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, perhaps I'd use an oldschool while, after constructing the first line individually

[09:37] <dakkar> grondilu: a more "obviously can't work" example would be something like `while ($buffer.bytes < $limit) { read-more-into-buffer($buffer) }`

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> assuming that the specific code comes after the data

[13:57] <grondilu> Anybody has an idea of how the palette in https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Raku was generated?  Is there a formula somewhere?

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu Interesting. I probably have to demonstrate how to do that with "JavaScript::D3" and/or "Text::Plot".

[14:06] <rf> Morning folks

[14:11] <grondilu> Anton Antonov: you're referring to displaying images in a terminal?

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @grondilu Well, I was talking about making Mandelbrot plots with Raku, but, yes, "Text::Plot" can be used in a terminal.

[16:48] <tonyo> anyone that's having trouble with it available to test?

[17:13] <Voldenet> grondilu: the palette there resembles simple hue color circle with various darkness levels

[17:14] *** deoac left
[17:15] <Voldenet> more obvious when you align it properly https://i.imgur.com/bV2qzFE.png

[17:18] * grondilu forked Image::PNG::Portable and added kitty protocol support: https://github.com/grondilu/Image-PNG-Portable

[17:19] *** razetime left
[17:19] <grondilu> ^that seems to work.  The example is mandelbrot and the gist method includes the kitty escape sequences.
