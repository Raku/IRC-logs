[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yjh: what you see is to be expected ... first pass your C uses A and then uses B which in turn uses A ... so in first compile you are running the main block of A twice (raku runs the module so that you can put things like setup code in the outer block) ... the twist is that second and subsequent passes, nodules A and B are now precompiled (and stored in your .precomp dir) ... and the precomp launcher is smart

[12:12] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to yjh

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> enough to remember that A is already compiled on both use's and to remember that is has already been run (from bytecode) when it is use'd the second time

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The gazillion raku.org changes turned out to be rather painful to consolidate

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, not as bad as it seemed first

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the included frames are the most touchy

[18:44] <melezhik> I try to find the way to provide version information in META6.json through rakumod file

[18:45] <melezhik> is it version_from or version-from ?

[18:45] <melezhik> I just don't remember the syntax

[22:34] <japhb> JSON::Class tests seem to be very unhappy under 2023.11+ (or so say my last couple rebuild-all attempts)

[22:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, which one of the two?

[23:07] <lizmat_> I have, but would like to review it first, which will be after some shuteye

[23:12] <ugexe> anyone on windows able to run a spec test with and without https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1776 to see what (if anything) it breaks?

[23:14] <ugexe> i guess you don't have to be on windows either, as if someone was clever enough they could run it through some CI type system

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> which one of the two JSON::Class projects are you testing?

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> vrurg recently created a brand new one

[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> one that is incompatible with the old JSON::Class, also as a kind of challenge on the naming system

[23:23] <japhb> Looks like JSON::Class:ver<0.0.3>:auth<zef:vrurg>:api<1.0.2> is what was found

[23:24] <japhb> So ... sounds like my usual build list got run over by vrurg's test
