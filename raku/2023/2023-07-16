[01:28] <SmokeMachine> Now my Configuration module does not use FALLBACK anymore. It creates new builder classes and uses those. And now the one using it should create a module declaring the test and that exports functions to be used for creating the config file (.rakuconfig) and for using the configuration where needed. I think it got better this way. Does anyone have any opinion? One day f the reasons I’ve done those changes was to have the builder 

[01:28] <SmokeMachine> class with all methods using the right types and a `config` sub waiting for a block that expects a arameter fro the right class to make it possible to Comma to autocomplete the method names, types and even documentation… but Comma is not even recognising `config` as an imported function, is that expected or a bug? I couldn’t make it work here (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/examples/test1/test1.rakuconfig#L3) 

[01:28] <SmokeMachine> neither here (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/examples/cro/cro.rakuconfig#L2). Any idea?

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Perl and Raku are unopinionated and slow-by-design languages so there go the main characteristics of Rust

[08:22] *** siavash joined
[08:24] <Voldenet> I don't think raku is slow-by-design at all, it's certainly faster than perl/python/js by design

[08:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> We would never know that but I seriously doubt that were the case with JS

[08:26] <Voldenet> all of the above languages are fully dynamic - you can never be too sure what arguments are passed where

[08:27] <Voldenet> there are tricks that basically make the code fully typed/constrained, which looks like raku

[08:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> What would that even mean and how is that not the case in Raku?

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Also, types are a runtime feature in Raku, not something to make the code faster, rather the opposite

[08:28] <Voldenet> when in raku you type in `sub x(Int $a, Int $b) { $a + $b }` you can generate simple `add ax, bx;` with overflow flag check and slow path

[08:29] <Voldenet> Sure, in practice, this code allocates…

[08:29] <Voldenet> …but that's just implementation detail

[08:29] <Voldenet> m: my $x = 1; say $x.WHERE; $x++; say $x.WHERE;

[08:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 34a1a5da5: OUTPUT: «5512020664400␤5512020664440␤»

[08:29] <Voldenet> IMO that's one of the biggest pain points

[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The fact that types are a runtime feature is hardly an implementation detail though

[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That's well within the interface of the language

[08:30] <Voldenet> given fully known types and constraints, optimized assembly can be easily generated by jit easily

[08:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> But even then, we quickly reach the grey zone, namely that a huge amount of Raku code manipulates metadata directly

[08:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Whether it's a part of the design or not

[08:31] <Voldenet> which could invalidate jit constraints

[08:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> If we consider things like generating a class or a sub dynamically, a canonical part of the language, then the question wouldn't even arise

[08:34] <Voldenet> Sure, the design makes you able to make things slow

[08:34] <Voldenet> you can do that in every jit-based language

[08:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It's a bit different when you really just can't optimize rather mundane things because the metadata needs to be extensible at any point

[08:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> This is not just "slow code"

[08:36] <Voldenet> in js you can do that as well

[08:36] *** jpn joined
[08:37] <Voldenet> but fast monomorphic code gets generated for cases where you don't generate tons of polymorphic call sites

[08:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> From all I know, JS has very limited and easy-to-spot utilities for that

[08:40] <Voldenet> you can also kill golang, rust and C# with megamorphism, basically altering shape is performance-unfriendlyu

[08:41] <Voldenet> however altering the shape for every call site is super rare

[08:41] *** jpn left
[08:42] <Voldenet> in practice something like `my $a = 1 but A but B but C …` is going to produce fairly constant shape at given point

[08:42] <Voldenet> or limited number of shapes

[08:44] <Voldenet> There are also features like dynamic variables, that introduce variants of generated methods, but most `call-based variables` can fit easily onto the stack

[08:54] <Voldenet> in fact, js coding have evolved - in js you can theoretically use prototypes

[08:54] <Voldenet> practically because of performance problems people don't do that

[08:57] *** sena_kun joined
[08:58] <Voldenet> some things in raku are in fact designed for performance, like metaoperators ([+], [*], Z, X, >>., >>.>> etc.)

[08:59] <Voldenet> when the shape of data is obvious, these can use avx operators directly

[09:00] *** sacomo joined
[09:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well I think you are digressing for starters, and here as well I can only say that these optimizations assume that types are not some manipulated runtime feature like any data

[09:04] <Voldenet> Let's say optimizations can work as long as you don't modify Int or use mixins

[09:04] <Voldenet> this can be a simple flag that would disable avx entirely

[09:07] <Voldenet> In fact, bigger problem with metadata manipulation is not the shape, but interface manipulation and bugs caused by it

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> There isn't even a proper "list of integers" type

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> And that's not an oversight

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Typing is brought in by containers and List doesn't create containers

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> (well, all the more reason Array shouldn't descend from List)

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> (or better said, List shouldn't be called this way, it's really just a skeleton type)

[09:10] <Voldenet> Are those runtime guarantees?

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> What are?

[09:11] <Voldenet> that lists /must not/ be typed

[09:13] *** Sgeo_ left
[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> You cannot annotate List for a type at all, right?

[09:14] <Voldenet> maybe you can't

[09:17] <Voldenet> but this can be stored with the list

[09:19] <Voldenet> things like `my $x = (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42); [+] $x` know a lot about runtime

[09:19] <Voldenet> and can infer all the contexts

[09:20] <Voldenet> while things like `my $x = (1, $y, 3)` with $y being mutable is a lot more difficult to optimize

[09:20] <Voldenet> but those all references held can be known by the runtime IMO

[09:21] <Voldenet> (in the above case $x can't really have specified type)

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch  and @Voldenet Interesting discussion!

[13:01] *** jpn joined
[13:02] <Voldenet> I'm just trying to bring some optimism into optimisations ;)

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think there really is a huge gap between the actual audience of Raku and the theoretical potential audience of it

[13:06] *** jpn left
[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Simply following survivorship, actual users treat performance as a secondary priority - on the other hand, they might value some Rakudo metamodel hackery to achieve something specifically dynamic

[13:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> If you told these people that for the sake of further optimizations, all of this will have to be stalled at the very least, they probably wouldn't like that

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Anyway, I think I've said it countless times but the current audience and estimated future of Raku crucially depends on what opinion one has about Rakudo

[13:23] *** siavash left
[13:25] <Voldenet> Performance is of secondary priority and you can see that by usage of immutable structures, very rarely code needs to actually be fast

[13:26] <Voldenet> and if it does, it's only a tiny path

[15:44] <[Coke]> he is, for sure

[15:49] *** jpn joined
[15:51] <guifa> he also gave me an evil idea for Raku

[15:51] <guifa> but it's gonna require a TON of research/work on my side

[15:54] <SmokeMachine> guifa: what idea?

[15:55] *** jpn left
[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> by way of my explorations with Rust (Dan::Polars) I have had the pleasure of writing some Rust code, I would say, for me, that Rust is about 10 times harder to write than Raku - it is truly awesome that people can be productive in Rust - they must be sooo smart! (or have a LOT of exposure to the idioms) ... so we must factor in the developer speed as well as the execution speed

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> Rust was interesting but it made everything that is simple in C really complicated (or even impossible) to do

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> despite the warnings from the Polars guys NOT to run .map and .apply do to slow execution speed, I did make a toy implementation so you can go something like this

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> df.select([col("nrs2").apply("|a: i32| (a + a + 1) as i32").alias("jones")]).head;

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so the bit in the "lambda" ... "|a: i32| (a + a + 1) as i32" is Rust

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and that does code generation of a mini rust call on the fly into a dynlib that the Polars library calls ....

[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this maybe slow for Rust, but is fast for Raku!

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Sawyer X also held a presentation on Perl 7 and ultimately I think he was "the right type of guy"

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Voldenet: well well, when I'm talking about performance and Raku in one sentence, you should be comparing against Perl, JS and Python, not Rust...

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and the truth is, even today, some pretty naive code can be slower to an unforgivable extent, like by a magnitude or close to that

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this doesn't keep Rust or Go users away but mere Python or Perl users

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and just as much as I maintain that there is no point in aiming at Rust - it's really Rakudo that pins us to a certain relation with these other dynamic languages

[16:40] *** euandreh left
[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> moreover I'd like to repeat that Rust simply has a fundamentally different mindset to anything that is Perl in any sense

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rust is safe merely by not letting you do loads of stuff

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's basically a compiler written for a C++ best practises book, with the additional goodies that come from having a real standard with those best practices enforced

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Raku as a language is particularly similar to C++ when it comes to the mindset - it expands horizontally to cover everything anyone has ever wished for

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> probably Python is the best comparable for Raku ultimate speed objective (without the GIL) … but they have had a while to tune that so I would not expect Raku to get there soon

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^++

[18:48] <guifa> There are times and places for both types.  That's why I think the Python/Perl/Raku/Ruby + Rust/C/C++ model is so popular.

[19:04] *** jpn joined
[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's two different classifications

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Python is defined in opposition to Perl and while Ruby is more inspired by Perl, it's definitely somewhere in between. Go and Zig are defined alongside C while C++ is defined against it and Rust is somewhere inbetween, deliberately loosening ties with C++

[19:08] *** jpn left
[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> C is a simple language, it most certainly isn't "difficult". However, it's fair to say that it is "hard", meaning it's not very productive. Performance is often (usually?) traded for productivity which is highly orthogonal to simplicity

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Just think about how many renowned software engineers and/or programming language designers referred to C++ explicitly, especially as an example of what they don't like/want. Ken Thompson+Rob Pike, Linus Torvalds, Alan Kay, Yukihiro Matsumoto and really I don't want to dig out further names, probably you could find something similar around Java or Python as well

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Does this mean that C++ is a bad language? No, it doesn't mean that

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It means that these people don't believe in this mindset that you will just horizontally scale a programming language to cover all problems anybody could ever have

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> how can I use qqx// or run<> to go echo “xx” >> file.txt

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ??

[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what problem are you facing?

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> run <echo xx >> file.txt>; doesn’t work

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i have tried various options

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> run works on programs and echo is a shell builtin I think

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well i tried with qqx also

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what happened with qqx?

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> don’t worry, i’ll just use spurt :-) tx!

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 😝
