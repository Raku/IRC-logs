[00:00] <Tirifto> Bridge and Real were not mentioned in the documentation on ‚ÄòContext and contextualizers‚Äô. I wonder if there‚Äôs a better place I should have searched in? Or should there be no single page in the official documentation to learn all of this from? `o`

[00:01] *** reportable6 joined
[00:08] <avuserow> Yes, I agree. I actually only knew this because I implemented a module using this many years ago. Though I don't remember what the minimum requirements are, and I'm still a bit confused on getting the `+` operator to work.

[00:09] <avuserow> "I agree" in the sense that this should be documented in a single consistent place, since this is very useful in the right domain :)

[00:13] <avuserow> m: class Foo does Real {has Int() $.data; method Bridge { $!data }; method succ {self + 1}}; multi sub infix:<+>(Foo $a, Real $b) {Foo.new(:data($a.data + $b))}; my $f = Foo.new(:data(3)); $f++; say $f; say $f.WHAT; my $f2 = $f + 1; say $f2; say $f2.WHAT; my $f3 = $f + $f2; say $f3; say $f3.WHAT

[00:16] <avuserow> I feel like there's a better way than re-implementing all the math operators, but maybe it depends on how you want your type to behave?

[00:20] <avuserow> e.g. do you need `$f++` to return a Foo instance? `$f--`? `$f * 4`? and not to mention if there's a Foo and Bar, which one wins?

[00:22] <avuserow> https://docs.raku.org/type/Real#method_Bridge has more details

[01:46] <guifa> so one of the catches making a new number class isn't so much reimplementing the math operators but making sure that they work globally 

[01:46] <guifa> that's not in and of itself hard, but it deoptimizes all over the place

[01:47] <guifa> right now, the best way that I know how to do it is to wrap each infix, and wrapping is slooooow

[02:07] <guifa> If there were a way to add multi candidates at the global level that would solve things and probs not kill optimizations but I don't think there is a way, and I'm not sure there will be a way

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> To be fair, the abstraction is correct. It's not an intrinsic property of numbers that they are ordered

[08:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It is, however, an intrinsic property of real numbers

[18:57] <Tirifto> Has anyone perchance used the NCurses package by azawawi? `o`

[19:25] <Tirifto> There‚Äôs a set of functions (getstr, getnstr, wgetstr, etc.) which take a string as an argument (char* in C, Str in the Raku binding), and are supposed to read a string from input and store it there. But when I pass a String to one of these functions, its value never changes.

[19:27] <Tirifto> The library uses NativeCall and I tried adding ‚Äòis rw‚Äô to the Str argument (though by my understanding that shouldn‚Äôt be necessary), but to no avail. So I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, or if the library is, and in the latter case, if it might be simple to fix or not. `o`

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry must to bed - another good place to ask is stackoverflow with the [raku] tag...

[20:53] <Tirifto> Good night, librasteve.
