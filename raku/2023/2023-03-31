[01:03] *** xinming left
[01:04] <guifa> fuck it, let's go for it

[01:04] <guifa> But plz if anyone has any other ideas I'd like one or two more

[01:05] *** xinming joined
[01:16] <guifa> maybe how to do truly inline languages (like my BASIC test or ecma regex) but not sure if that's better as a 20 or 50 minute talk

[01:16] *** japhb left
[01:30] <tonyo> that basic post was very good

[01:30] <tonyo> interestingly, it'd be cool to see a subset of datalog used in an orm like fashion with any backend (csv, sql, etc)

[01:31] <tonyo> which is something i've wanted to do for a while but i have only one brain

[01:32] <guifa> the only thing that's been holding me back from doing more on the inline languages is that I've not really figured out how to install a sub/ multi sub via QAST nodes

[01:32] *** japhb joined
[01:33] <guifa> which will really be a non issue once the big switch to RakuAST happens because then I can just drop a RakuAST::Statement::Expression.new( expression => RakuAST::Sub.new( … ) ) and done :-)

[01:38] * guifa hasn't worked with datalog but ... up for a challenge

[01:41] <guifa> oh wait I guess I did figure out subs ha

[02:20] <lucs> tonyo: Hmm... Upgraded to 49; hangs after I enter my password for login.

[02:20] <lucs> Ctrl-C, then tried entering a wrong password, same hang.

[02:34] <tonyo> hit ctrl+c and enter a few times each, try `stty sane` ?

[02:34] <lucs> Sure, but I'm pretty sure my terminal is okay...

[02:35] <lucs> Yeah, no difference.

[02:36] <lucs> Do you happen to see login attempts in some log somewhere?

[02:36] <tonyo> hmm, then i'd suspect something else 

[02:36] <tonyo> you can try `fez -v login` to get _way_ more output

[02:36] <lucs> Trying...

[02:37] <tonyo> if it uses curl and hangs then try adding the kv `"bundlers": ["Fez::Util::Wget"]` to your $HOME/.fez-config.json

[02:38] <lucs> After prompting for password and my entering it, it hangs on ">>= DEBUG: [CURL:starting]"

[03:35] <tonyo> for log posterity, i meant to ask lucs to add key "requestors" and not "bundlers"

[03:35] <lucs> tonyo: I'm instructing my friend pel (P.E.Lévesque) to do the same.

[03:36] <lucs> Is this something all current users will need to tweak manually?

[03:36] <tonyo> only if curl isn't playing nicely on their system

[03:37] <tonyo> i'm seeing if i can reproduce it now on an opensuse box

[03:52] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I installed both wget and curl with homebrew, and still failing

[03:54] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I just tired using ｢"requestors": ["Fez::Util::Curl"]｣ in my fez config. I get all kinds of text.. a lot... At the end I do get the list of my modules though.

[04:08] <tonyo> pelevesque the `-v` flag provides a ton of info, only time you may need it is for a bug report

[04:15] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Thanks for the tip

[04:21] <tonyo> pelevesque: try a `zef upgrade fez` and curl should get you going

[04:23] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tonyo I get All requested distributions are already at their latest versions I'm on fez 49

[04:24] <tonyo> v50 is indexed, maybe you beat the indexer

[04:27] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> @tonyo I did zef uninstall fez and then zef install fez and got version 49. Could it be a mirror that is not yet updated for me?

[04:28] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Maybe 'zef update' first?

[04:29] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> (just saying, I dunno how this stuff works)

[04:31] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Not sure if normal or not.

[04:31] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> maybe if I logout and log back in it would fix it.

[04:32] <tonyo> yea you're not logged in so it's assuming you are who you were and showing you your packages, if you were logged in it would also show you packages belonging to any group you belong to

[18:38] <tonyo> Xliff: it's super easy to change the context of that generator the way it's written so it should be easy enough to create subsets for custom stuff, like outputting a man page 

[18:38] <tonyo> are you asking for svg as part of the html tags or separately?

[18:40] <Ergo444> hello.. How can I print the moar byte code of a program and disassemle it or assmple it?

[18:42] <lucs> Hey, if I have "export RAKULIB=$HOME/no-such-dir" and then run for example the REPL, when I leave it, the $HOME/no-such-dir directory will have been created.

[18:42] <lucs> What's up with that?!

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hit on the moarvm IRC channel if you are that fixated on it tbh

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can't see any positive outcome

[18:44] <[Coke]> I wouldn't bother moarvm with that, I'd open a github ticket on rakudo/rakudo

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not that, the "print the moar byte code of a program and disassemble it" one

[18:46] <[Coke]> it creates a .precomp directory as well

[18:46] <[Coke]> Ah, that makes sense.

[18:46] <lucs> [Coke];

[18:46] <lucs> indeed

[18:54] <vrurg> lucs: What is RAKUDO is compiler-specific. What is RAKU is language-specific.

[18:56] <lucs> vrurg: Yep, that I get, but I'm wondering about the RAKULIB envvar.

[18:56] <lucs> It doesn't seem to appear in the Raku docs.

[18:56] <lucs> So is it rakudo specific?

[18:57] <lucs> I'm not happy with having directories mysteriously appear because of a typo in a RAKULIB setting.

[19:00] <lucs> But I'm happy in general terms, so there is that :-)

[19:01] <lucs> Going fook shopping now, tty folks later.

[19:01] <lucs> Food too.

[19:01] <Xliff> tonyo: Whichever is easiest.

[19:02] <Xliff> I kind of like how you did the HTML tags, so as long as it doesn't affect what you already have, keep the same style.

[19:04] <vrurg> lucs: The rule applies to everything. Say, RAKUDO_DEBUG environment variable – guess it! ;)

[19:06] <lucs> vrurg: Maybe I misunderstood you: if the envvar begins with "RAKUDO", it's to do with the (that) compiler, but "RAKU" followed by something different is language specific?

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lucs I hope fook shopping is legal where you live. Or at least socially acceptable…

[19:08] <lucs> Anton: Er, in any case, I try to keep that shopping private ;)

[19:08] <vrurg> lucs: Exactly. Say, if we get another Raku compiler named Whatever it would understand RAKULIB exactly as Rakudo does.

[19:09] <lucs> vrurg: Okay. Then two problems: - It would be nice to see it documented in the docs (no match at this time) - I'd like to know the rationale for its contents sometimes leading to directory creation.

[19:10] <lucs> (Gotta go, too warm with my winter coat on inside...)

[19:14] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/language/modules has docs on RAKULIB

[19:14] <vrurg> lucs: I guess a directory gets created because Rakudo tries to use it as a repository. Should be documented, perhaps. But it is barely the highest priority of all the documentation tasks, I think. Besides, would be good if ugexe confirms my guess first.

[19:48] <ugexe> lucs: i think your example is incomplete, in that you'd also have to use a module and not just start the repl. then it precompiles to the head repository (in this case whatever RAKULIB is set to) in $HOME/no-such-dir/.precomp

[19:48] <tonyo> Xliff: i'll add that to Ryml and an interface to define a type somewhere

[20:46] <[Coke]> ugexe: it created the directory for me when launching the repl (presumably because the REPL uses modules on startup if it can)

[20:46] <[Coke]> raku -e 'say 1' did not.

[21:08] *** jgaz left
[21:13] *** Ergo444 left
[21:35] <lucs> ugexe: I rechecked, and like [Coke] confirms, simply opening/closing the REPL creates the directory, with its .precomp subdir.

[21:35] <lucs> My naive understanding of RAKULIB is roughly "look in these directories first to find modules your program wants to use".

[21:36] <lucs> And during development, that is very useful: no need to maintain temporary 'use lib…' statements all over the place.

[21:37] <lucs> (Oh, and indeed, something like  raku -e 'say 1'  does not.)

[21:40] <ugexe> if you have Linenoise or Readline I guess opening the repl will use a module

[21:41] <lucs> Oh, yeah, I do.

[21:43] <lucs> But I don't quite understand: why isn't having a RAKULIB envvar that designates a non-existent directory the same as not having the envvar set at all?

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because RAKULIB is only roughly "look in these directories first to find modules your program wants to use"

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it rather turns the folder into a repository of modules, a very simple repository, iirc

[21:46] <lucs> Nemokosch: Fair enough, re. your first comment, and in that case, user docs on its usage seem pretty important.

[21:46] <tellable6> lucs, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you can also notice that if you set RAKULIB to a huge folder, stuff will get slow

[21:48] <lucs> Yeah, and than matches my naive understanding :)

[21:48] <lucs> *that

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can't find it at the moment but iirc it gets slow for startup even
