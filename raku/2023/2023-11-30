[16:59] <lizmat> tbrowder_: rescheduled

[16:59] <[Coke]> is everything christmas themed this year or do we still have a mix of christmas stuff and more general blog posts?

[17:00] <[Coke]> (No judging, just curious)

[17:01] <lizmat> a mix so far

[17:06] <mort> Hi! With a raku grammar, how do you deal with two options which share the same prefix?

[17:07] <lizmat> thanks to Longest Token Matching you don't have to worry about that

[17:07] <mort> isn't that a regex thing rather than a grammar thing?

[17:08] <lizmat> m: say "foobar" ~~ / fooba | foobz /

[17:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3e68caa1: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢foobaÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[17:08] <lizmat> a grammar is basically just a class with named regexes as methods

[17:08] <mort> I'm talking about essentially: `rule expression { <assign-expr> | <func-call-expr> } rule assign-expr { <identifier> '=' <expression> } rule func-call-expr { <identifier> '(' ')' }`

[17:09] <mort> assign-expr and func-call-expr both start with the same rule, <identifier>; this seems to be causing issues

[17:17] <mort> actually, this might be something else...

[17:19] <mort> yeah never mind

[17:22] <lizmat> LTM is your friend :-)

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> you could swap them around so the precedence changes <fun-call-expression> | <assign-exp>

[17:31] <ab5tract> hey .vushu, does the snowfall example work for you with `load-font-ex` using a unicode symbol? I still can't get it to work

[17:33] <ab5tract> I know you had 'Ab5tract' working but I wonder if you've managed with unicode

[17:35] <ab5tract> I'm currently writing an advent post on the snowfall simulator :)

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Hi @abstract That really cool üòÑ I have not yet tried with unicode I will see if I can get it working.
