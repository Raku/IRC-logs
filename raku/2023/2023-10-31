[00:08] <ugexe> oh heh
[00:09] <ugexe> ZEF_CONFIG_STOREDIR=...
[00:09] <ugexe> if you set this to e.g. $PWD/mydarkpan and then run `zef fetch CSV::Parser`, it will store CSV::Parser into that directory
[00:09] <ugexe> and that directory (when that env var is set) will be used as the zef cache
[00:10] <ugexe> you can use `zef install ...` (not neccesarily zef fetch) and it will also store/use that directory
[00:12] <ugexe> the only thing is, if you move that directory you have to run `zef update` in some fashion. `zef install Foo --update`, `zef update`, `zef update cached`, any of these
[00:13] <ugexe> technically that doesn't need to be the case though. I think it just write absolute paths to the MANIFEST.zef file in the root of whatever directory you give it. it could just write relative paths
[00:16] *** buildable6 left
[00:16] <ugexe> the cache isn't preferred over remote sources anymore, so to see it working without actually disabling your internet, you'd disable the other ecosystems via --/rea --/fez
[00:17] <ugexe> i.e. `ZEF_CONFIG_STOREDIR="$PWD/mydists" zef install CSV::Parser --/rea --/fez`
[00:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> thanks
[00:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> definitely checking this one out soonish
