[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik> This is well known GitHub related issue where it caches images embedded into Markdown, try to rewrite badge url adding and query in the end of URL , like ?foo=bar , it will break cache and make GitHub render image every time , see this https://github.com/melezhik/SparrowCI/issues/4#issuecomment-1676383488 as an example

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu Change of plans -- I will troll you with chess position images.

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The examples in the README of "FEN::Grammar" do not run "smoothly". So, issues coming your way...

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube hehe you welcome to troll me any time üòÅ

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @melezhik okay thank you for explaining üòÉ

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik> vushu: ++

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu You got an issue.

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ seems to be an issue with rakubrew ...

[18:11] <stanrifkin_> librasteve: had the same problem

[18:12] <stanrifkin_> <librasteve>: What version of Perl are you using?

[18:12] <stanrifkin_> <librasteve>: If you're using perlbrew switch back to the system Perl or earlier version.

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no perlbrew

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anywho, rakubrew build seems to have done the trick

[18:17] <stanrifkin_> ok

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> have raised an issue here https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/78

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx!

[18:18] <stanrifkin_> good, I wondered why there is none

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @.vushu Here is what I have so far (the image corresponds to the example in "FEN::Grammar"):

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1189271148492496966/JavaScript-D3-chess-position-example.png?ex=659d8e11&is=658b1911&hm=292e9624ca66a06b7a1b8c25c1e24b460d68133bcfadc7d2aacc11ffc9b23417&

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have to productize it and submit  to raku.land.

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ++

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and rakubrew build-zef

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube that‚Äôs great what did you use to draw the board? üòÉ

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> D3.js ‚Äî see ‚ÄúJavaScript:D3‚Äù. Same package I use for the random mandalas video.

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ah cool interopting with js, I will try it out some time!

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> At this point, I am not sure should "JavaScript::D3" depend on "FEN::Grammar". So, the first version is going to use hash-based chess position specs.

[19:48] *** AntonOks left
[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I thought i was a new thing like chess2png or something which depends on those.

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe working on "raylib" biases your thinking.

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @.vushu  It looks like "FEN::Grammar" does not parse the examples here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards_Notation . Hence, a new issue is filed.

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube yeah I know it doesn't parse the rest, since I made It so it only focused on the position, since that what is your use case for drawing it right? I can easily add the rest if needed.

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> From my perspective, if you just ignore the rest that is fine too.

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube if you or other people someday need it I will ofcourse implement the rest.

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu I am not that interested in chess, but since I plan to do some comparison of Raku and other systems (say, using LLMs) over chess, I might request full parsing soon.

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube no problem üëç

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can see here that white pieces are transparent -- I am not sure is this a feature or a bug.

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1189302428399575070/JavaScript-D3-chess-position-example-2.png?ex=659dab33&is=658b3633&hm=3f51a6c3c4a38c04b3aae279dfb622f15022215229dee9f92380788ce5c90d45&

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Is unicode chess pieces right?

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think, this how they come from the "default unicode system" on my macOS.

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes,

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> yeah I think white are transparent also on my machie

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> kinda annoying

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, let us say it is a feature and declare victory. (For now.)

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> yeah sure üòÑ

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This chessboard plotting is opportunistic -- it is too much work to make snow animation using convolution and D3.js. But, since I implemented last night "heatmap plots" this morning I realized they can be easily converted into chessboard images.

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> ah that's clever

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks!

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu I did not understand from you comments -- I are you going to implement the ignoring of the rest of the FEN notation arguments?

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> If you wish to have the state I can implement it

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, please, implemented at least that. Then I can make chessboard demos by just copy-and-paste "random" FEN strings from diffrent sites.

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> alright I will take a look at it, I probably just add it as optional, so if you don't have it it still will parse the positions
