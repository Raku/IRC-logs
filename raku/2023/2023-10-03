[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is another clickbait -- I re-programmed Raku's "Jupter::Chatbook" to Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pv0QRGc7Rw

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I plan to blog about reprogramming Raku LLM packages into Python packages. Well, that is going to be one of the talking points in my TRC-2023 talk.
