[17:32] <[Coke]> the change to .rakutest means anyone using prove needs to add a --ext=rakutest

[17:45] <cfa> prove6 is preferred, right?

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> to be honest, this extension change seems kinda voluntaristic here

[17:47] <tonyo> it needs to be backwards compatible

[17:47] <tonyo> otherwise half of the modules in the eco will either be untestable or install without tests

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what initiated it? the deprecation of the .t extension was nowhere written and nobody talked about it up until like 2 or 3 months ago

[17:48] <tonyo> it was a big discussion ~2 years ago

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this isn't like .pm6 or .p6

[17:48] <tonyo> it's part of that discussion, too

[17:48] <tonyo> we were trying to determine _what_ the extension should be and test extensions got pulled into that

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but that discussion apparently didn't lead to the conclusion that is kinda taken at face value at the moment

[17:49] *** euandreh left
[17:49] <tonyo> what do you mean?

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that .t was not decided to be deprecated and now all of a sudden, people started acting as if it was

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't care much for the extensions, to be honest; much rather it would be good to know how these processes come to be and how to synchronize them

[17:51] <[Coke]> From my standpoint - I've had on my list updating raku/doc to follow all the new extensions, as a canary, for some times. previous doc person was more cautious. Now that the site is live, I'm going forward with it.

[17:53] <tonyo> [Coke]++

[17:53] <tonyo> nemokosch: ah, yes, it wasn't as explicit as the pm6 -> rakumod extension change

[17:53] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to Nemokosch

[17:53] <[Coke]> Next on my rename list is pod6 to rakudoc - will do one, make sure the new site can deal with it, then do them all.

[17:54] <[Coke]> (rakumod was already done because it doesn't impact anything downstream)

[17:56] *** euandreh joined
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not the spokesperson of the .t extension but it would be good to know how it fell obsolete 3 years later

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> mind you, it's completely possible that other people just don't put too much thought into things like that but my recurring worry is that an outsider would get contradictory feedback and impressions about a lot of Raku-related things which can easily imply chaos

[18:07] <tonyo> it is a bit that way and the docs should be updated

[18:07] <tonyo> as fez moves into the dist management space (i'm currently writing a gzip module so now system deps are necessary from fez or from zef) then a lot of that can start to be cleaned up

[19:11] <patrickb> I'm wondering about nqp::handle(). It seems the things written it its argument list aren't executed until they are used. Is there some special casing going on or is that some standard functionality I'm blissfully unaware of?

[19:16] <tonyo> are they being thunked?

[19:16] *** jpn joined
[19:18] <patrickb> Hm. Docs don't have much to say about thunks. Anywhere to read up about them?

[19:20] <patrickb> Code usually looks like this: nqp::handle(code(value), 'EMIT', $state.run-emit(), 'DONE', $state.run-done(), 'CATCH', $state.run-catch());

[19:36] <tonyo> thunking in haskell means something isn't evaluated until it's used, eg x = len(inf) would return a thunk and not hang until x was used elsewhere

[19:37] <tonyo> in terms of nqp i'd guess that the $state.run-emit isn't evaluated until that nqp::handle is evaluated

[19:37] <tonyo> but i haven't dug around in there for a while

[21:41] <rf> How do you compare objects? I've never actually had to do this before lol

[21:53] *** jpn joined

[22:09] <moritz> there's eqv for structural comparison, and === for object identity

[22:09] *** rf left

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> === normally works using the .WHICH representation, while eqv works as a .raku comparison by default but since it's meant to be generic, it's to be expected that it's overloaded in all funky ways

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what also uses the .WHICH representation is the hash

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and all data structures backed by a hash some way (Sets, for example)

[22:15] *** jpn joined
[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh I wish it was disallowed (or at least strongly and explicitly discouraged) to overload most built-in operators; the ones that aren't explicitly meant to be generic, at the very least

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you start overloading e.g numeric operators for values that cannot be meaningfully coerced into numeric values, you basically drill a hole into the predictability of the code

[23:02] <guifa_> Thus the trick though -- how do you know someone isn't overloading for an object that isn't sufficiently numeric?  This is def a case wehre the philosophy is to give folks enough rope to hang themselves BUT also provide sufficient enough guidance (== and eq, along with the existance of ===, eqv, cmp, =:=, etc should clue people in that maybe they should at least give thought to how to compare a custom class)

[23:02] <guifa_> but if someone wanted to figure out a way to hack in, say, hyperreal numbers… haha
