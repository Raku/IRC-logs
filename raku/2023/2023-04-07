[01:44] <guifa> dang, datetime formatters are moving much faster

[01:44] <guifa> In just two evenings I've got 12 of the 45 or so finished

[01:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @guifa how many hours per format you spent on?

[01:49] <guifa> Depends

[01:49] <guifa> Right now I'm on a roll because simple ones like day / minute / second are really easy

[01:49] <guifa> Can copy and paste a lot

[01:50] <guifa> but the date time periods required a bit more thought, but I'd say averaging about 20ish each while multitasking so far including testing etc (although I need to write more tests)

[01:51] *** squashable6 left
[01:52] <guifa> I'm not a fast coder lol

[01:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Wow -- that is some dedication!

[02:28] <guifa> AntonAntonov: yes, I based it off of the ECMA grammar, although with some edits.  I also cheated a bit and stole some from jnthn's Cro module

[02:28] <guifa> but his wasn't nearly as complete as mine 

[02:29] <guifa> s/complete/exhaustive

[02:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I see -- really good to know.

[02:33] <guifa> The only thing keeping it from being more maintainable long term is name spacing issues

[02:34] <guifa> so unfortunately I'm forced to do old fashioned prefix namespacing 

[02:34] <guifa> resulting in those hideously long token names

[02:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> ðŸ¤”

[02:39] <guifa> Basically, I was hoping to be able to use one of the techniques I mention in my talking on mixing grammars

[02:40] <guifa> the problem is that the match objects being passed around aren't standard raku match objects and they fail a type match test and I can't figure out how to create them separately

[02:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Right -- there is a file named "Grammar-Mixin.rakumod".

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Interesting...

[02:46] <guifa> I'll definitely keep investigating.  I'd love nothing more than to be able to reduce things down to 2-5 lines of boilerplate that imports only a single token that can reference dozens of its own properly namespaced tokens

[02:49] <guifa> I *really* want to be able to do that to enable foreign language slangs (e.g. ruby-sub foo( â€¦ ) {Â â€¦Â } ) 

[02:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I had some sort similar question / want -- given a proto token can have method for the proto only. (I.e. not to have to program all the syms...)

[19:47] <[Coke]> trying to mi6-ify a repository, it's telling me "Must run in the top directory", but I am.

[19:51] <[Coke]> ah. Mi6 requires there to be a lib directory (a single simple bin/ script won't work)

[19:56] <tonyo> .

[19:56] <tonyo> [Coke]: wonder how fez would deal with that too tbh [Coke]

[20:20] <[Coke]> you could try it on commit 2bb7731 on github/coke/sudoku-helper

[20:20] <[Coke]> (I just fixed it up to work with mi6 and cut a new releaes)

[20:20] <[Coke]> ... which forced me to do the lib/ split and added tests while I was doing it, yay.

[22:36] <guifa> hooray, I now have all datetime formatter patterns remade in RakuAST with the exception of timezones and year cycles  (the latter isn't used in gregorian so it's a bit moot until I extend for support of other calendar types)
