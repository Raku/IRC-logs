[08:16] <Xliff> \o

[08:16] <Xliff> Does anyone know how to create a Buf[uint8] from the same memory as a CArray[uint8]?

[08:22] *** razetime left
[08:34] *** jpn left
[08:34] <kjp> Unfortunately not -- it would be really useful.

[08:35] <kjp> Being able to have methods like read-uint32 and so on available on CArrays would be nearly as good.

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> cool, so Andrew did make the idea I also had (Roman numeral task with grammars)

[23:06] <guifa_> can we access the unicode property Script_Extensions in RAku regex?

[23:07] <guifa_> ^^ should yield <Â§ßÈò™ 2000 üëå> if I can figure out the syntax and we support

[23:55] <guifa_> hmmm, trying to call a parent method isn't working as expected in RakaAST.

[23:56] <guifa_> m: class A is Array { method AT-POS(|) { 'nope' } }; my @a is A = 1,2,3,4; say @a.Array::AT-POS(2), @a.AT-POS(2).

[23:56] <guifa_> m: class A is Array { method AT-POS(|) { 'nope' } }; my @a is A = 1,2,3,4; say @a.Array::AT-POS(2), @a.AT-POS(2)

[23:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4e0ecaa33: OUTPUT: ¬´3nope‚ê§¬ª

[23:57] <guifa_> if you construct a method call as name => RakuAST::Name.from-identifier-parts("Array","AT-POS"), it errors with a No such method `Array::AT-POS`
