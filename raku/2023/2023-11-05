[04:23] <[Coke]> anyone want to help out with raku.org, we could use a translation of a 10 line jQuery function to plain JS.
[04:23] <[Coke]> It's the only thing on the site using jQuery, so we could remove the whole lib if we get rid of it.

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> One of my package -- "Jupyter::Chatbook" -- has a dependency on a package named "File::Which" which in turn depends on "LibraryMake". I cannot find both "File::Which" and "LibraryMake" in raku.land.
[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Are these packages supposed to be used?

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://raku.land/?page=68  ... yes its on the alpha listing, but the search box shows it but the link is broken
[21:42] <lizmat> https://github.com/JJ/P6-LibraryMake
