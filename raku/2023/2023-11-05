[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> One of my package -- "Jupyter::Chatbook" -- has a dependency on a package named "File::Which" which in turn depends on "LibraryMake". I cannot find both "File::Which" and "LibraryMake" in raku.land.

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Are these packages supposed to be used?

[21:21] <lizmat> afaik,es y

[21:22] <lizmat> *yes  :-)

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anton: try zef info File::Which

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (I also think that raku.land is missing File::Which - but raku.land is a [possibly erroneous] presentation layer on the fez and rea module repos)

[21:30] *** jpn left
[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i did an uninstall / install on both and they are still working and available - suggest an issue needed for raku.land?

[21:38] <lizmat> It is on RakuLand: https://raku.land/github:azawawi/File::Which

[21:38] <lizmat> it's just very hard to find  :-(

[21:38] <lizmat> LibraryMake: https://raku.land/zef:jjmerelo/LibraryMake

[21:39] <lizmat> antononcube ^^

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, thanks. I filed a GitHub issue:  https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake/issues/50

[21:41] <lizmat> hmmmm looks like the URL is wrong:

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve In the GitHub repository you pointed out.

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://raku.land/?page=68  ... yes its on the alpha listing, but the search box shows it but the link is broken

[21:42] <lizmat> https://github.com/JJ/P6-LibraryMake

[21:42] <lizmat> antononcube ^^ correct place for an issue

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok, thanks. I guess I should try to correct the dependencies in my package.

[23:19] <tbrowder__> [Coke]: rsc addition looks pretty good. BUT i still can't find where i made a comment/discussion starter about PR stuff. i know you or someone said where to see it on one of the github page headers somewhere, but it isn't obvious to me unless i accidentally land there.
