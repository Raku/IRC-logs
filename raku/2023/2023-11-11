[13:17] <tbrowder__> hi, anyone else having probs seeing rakudo.org?
[13:18] <andinus> it might be impacted by atikon outages as well
[13:18] <andinus> raku.org, planet.raku.org is down as well
[13:20] <tbrowder__> yea, i get msg from cloudfare about origin being unreachable
[13:20] <tbrowder__> what is atikon?
[13:22] <tbrowder__> hm, solar flare effects?
[13:24] <andinus> they sponsor the box where raku.org is hosted

[16:56] <coleman> Rakudo is currently a redirect to github. That one might be tricky
[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "raku.org & planet.raku.org should be up now" -- Good to know! I was wondering should I make a new Raku blog post or not...
[17:01] <codesections> The source for design.raku.org is at https://github.com/Raku/old-design-docs, if we really need it

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> once I get back from Germany, I will try to build a local raku.org site with Caddy

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Where I can see example of distribution dependent Raku module tests? For example, I want to run one set of tests on macOS and a different set (maybe empty) on Linux.

[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah well, eventually this challenge has to be faced one way or another
[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it would probably be the same with raku.land
[18:41] <coleman> I agree. I'm going to keep trying with the old site for now. Getting further than before
[19:38] <nine> I guess we should have given getting away from Atikon higher priority :/

[19:42] <coleman> Nothing like a little downtime to focus the mind
[19:43] <nine> Haha, so true!
[19:43] <nine> Do we have a backup of that VM that we could just run somewhere else?
[19:44] <coleman> At this point we are rebuilding on the Hetzner account owned by TPRF
[19:44] <coleman> Andinus rescued 80% of everything onto his personal server while we organize the permanent move

[20:09] <Marcool04> ok thanks coleman for the info, indeed the links to rakudo.org are redirecting to github which works for binaries (this is what I was after indeed)

[21:40] <Marcool04> ah... no, I spoke too soon
[21:40] <Marcool04> looks like the binaries were hosted elsewhere (accessible from rakudo.org)
[21:40] <Marcool04> but not on the release sections of the github repo
[21:41] <Marcool04> looks like i'll be compiling from source :)
[21:52] <El_Che> Marcool04: what are oy looking for?
[21:53] *** svartur-hrafn joined
[21:53] <Marcool04> I use arch linux AUR package rakudo-bin which usually pulls something like https://rakudo.org/dl/rakudo/rakudo-moar-2023.10-01-linux-x86_64-gcc.tar.gz
[21:53] <Marcool04> but that's redirecting to github, where there are - as far as I can tell - no binaries, just the source release tarball
[21:54] <El_Che> IC
[21:54] <Marcool04> incidentally, the arch linux package "rakudo" also tries to pull https://rakudo.org/dl/rakudo/rakudo-2023.10.tar.gz which also fails... but that can be replaced easily by https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/download/2023.10/rakudo-2023.10.tar.gz
