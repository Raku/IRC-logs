[11:05] <Ergo444> hi

[11:05] <Ergo444> Can you help? I am getting this error... Missing serialize REPR function for REPR MVMContext (BOOTContext)

[11:06] <Ergo444> What is that error?

[11:07] *** jpn left
[11:10] <lizmat> Ergo444: before we go on: which version of Rakudo are you using?

[11:10] *** jpn joined
[11:10] <Ergo444> Welcome to RakudoÔäó v2023.02.

[11:11] <lizmat> ah, and on Windows by the looks of it

[11:11] <Ergo444> It happens when a module used twice...   directly and indirectly

[11:11] <Ergo444> Not sure if that is all that is needed for that error

[11:12] <lizmat> in technical terms it means that somehow something is getting precompiled that shouldn't

[11:12] <lizmat> contexts are not something that can be pre-compiled, as they're a run-time concept

[11:12] <lizmat> can you provide a gist?

[11:12] <Ergo444> what?

[11:12] <lizmat> a shortened version of the code showing the problem

[11:13] <lizmat> placed somewhere for people to see, e.g. gist.github.com

[11:16] <lizmat> FWIW, that error should *not* occur in normal usage

[11:16] <lizmat> we call it an LTA error (Less Than Awesome)

[11:16] <lizmat> as it just states what went wrong, not why

[11:19] <Ergo444> https://gist.github.com/jaffa4/a2cc529f52a8db9c59f5b04a642ccbc4

[11:21] *** jpn left
[11:21] <Ergo444> low level error message

[11:22] <Ergo444> that is what I call it

[11:22] <lizmat> well, it *is* low level indeed

[11:22] <lizmat> issued at the moment the actual bytecode is being produced

[11:25] <lizmat> commenting on gist, I don't have the native libs installed (nor do I want to) and thus cannot try your code :-(

[11:26] <Ergo444> When do you need that?

[11:26] <lizmat> zef install Template::Nest::XS fails for me saying a native lib is missing

[11:27] <Ergo444> the code I gave you should be enough

[11:27] <Ergo444> in the gist

[11:27] <Ergo444> not need to install anything

[11:28] <Ergo444> just create a directory structure

[11:29] <lizmat> it fails on "use Template::Next::XS"

[11:29] <lizmat> because I do not have that installed

[11:30] <Ergo444> create the directories

[11:31] <Ergo444> Template\Nest\XS.rakumod

[11:33] <Ergo444> from the gist.

[11:36] <lizmat> trying this on a slow Debian box atm

[11:38] <lizmat> ok, can reproduce the issue. But only with Template::Nest::XS

[11:39] <Ergo444> does it use a reserved word?

[11:42] <lizmat> looking at source code of Template::Nest::XS now, as you seem to be the author, right ?

[11:42] <Ergo444> yes

[11:43] <Ergo444> if you replace Xs with the xs in the git, it does not work

[11:43] <Ergo444> no need to test complicated code

[11:43] <Ergo444> I already simplified it

[11:48] <lizmat> I simplified it to: lib/Container.rakumod containing just "use Template::Nest::XS"

[11:49] <lizmat> and container.raku just containing "use Container"

[11:49] <lizmat> and doing: raku -Ilib container.raku

[11:50] <lizmat> so the problem is somehow inside Template::Nest::XS

[11:52] <Ergo444> but it is empty

[11:52] <Ergo444> almost empty

[11:52] <lizmat> yes, so the problem isn't there?

[11:53] <lizmat> anyways, I don't see anything immediately in the source of Template::Nest::XS

[11:53] <lizmat> except maybe adapt the AUTHOR section ?

[11:55] <lizmat> apart from suggestion making a Rakudo issue, I don't think I can do much more for you atm

[11:55] <Ergo444> that is start

[12:34] <Ergo444> my @comment_delims_defaults[2] = '<!--', '-->';

[12:34] <Ergo444> if I remove [2], the error disappears

[12:41] <lizmat> ok, *that* is worthy of a Rakudo issue

[12:41] <lizmat> looks like shaped arrays include something they shouldn't

[12:41] <lizmat> Ergo444: are they considered to be constants?

[12:41] <lizmat> if so:

[12:42] <lizmat> my constant @comment_delims_defaults = '<!--', '-->';

[16:14] <tbrowder__> Ergo444: i would love it if a real windows raku user could create a cookbook recipe for installing and using raku on windows 10 or better. see a start at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/docs/windows.md

[16:15] <tellable6> 2023-06-18T14:48:01Z #raku-dev <tbrowder__> ugexe thanks, Nick.

[16:15] *** unicodable6 joined
[16:15] <ugexe> lhttps://rakubrew.org/?platform=win

[16:17] <tbrowder__> no, but i still need a cookbook. i guess i should put that in the other doc. i haven't looked lately, but the raku home page really need an in-your-face entry for windoze users.

[16:17] *** jpn joined
[16:18] <ugexe> that link basically is a cookbook in that it tells you exactly what commands to run

[16:18] <tbrowder__> i'm trying to get younger folks interested but the linux gap is too much jump for noobs

[16:21] <tbrowder__> like my grandson. they're having a "coding camp" this summer for 6th graders and i almost guarantee they won't have a linux computer there (or mac) unless i can sneak in :)

[16:23] <tbrowder__> oh, i didn't know rakubrew.org existed (or forgot or ignored it). i'll definitely ck it out

[16:23] <ugexe> the good thing about using rakubrew is the installation workflow is the same regardless of windows or linux, so if they get comfortable enough to run `bash` on their windows box (which runs the linux thing windows ships with) they can install raku the same way

[16:24] <tbrowder__> great! thanks

[16:25] <El_Che> I don't think beginners have a good programming experience on Windows for non MS languages, libs tend to suck

[16:25] <El_Che> specially if make is involved

[16:26] <tbrowder__> yes, for sure. ref the "linux" thing, i really need to check that out because that's been a show stopper for me, too, getting it without much pain on win 10

[16:27] <ugexe> i'm pretty sure you just have to type `bash` and it will work

[16:27] <El_Che> ugexe: you're assuming most people run wsl

[16:27] <El_Che> most don't in my experience

[16:30] <ugexe> i thought it would be turned on by default by now heh

[16:32] <El_Che> Even @work where people are IT people and most get a windows laptop, only the people that are geeky, but not geeky or rebel enough to get mac or linux, get the wsl. Most other devs and admins just struggle with Windows and remote shells to linux infra

[16:33] <El_Che> ugexe: I problem I encoutered that centrally manage laptop lock people out of installing wsl

[16:41] <tbrowder__> yep, i retired just as our takeover company IT dept started doing that to us bought-oughtees. good time to leave, it was.

[16:41] <tbrowder__> course that was when dual boot wasn't so grabby, either.

[16:43] <tbrowder__> now i feel like i have to carry 2 laptops on the road if i want windows around :-(

[16:47] <tbrowder__> ok, checked out rakubrew.org. one problem in my view: it's not real clear what os is being shown until i start looking at the shell script name

[16:49] <tbrowder__> the highlight on the selected os is barely distinguishable to my eyes.
