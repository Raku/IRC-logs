[01:22] <jaguart> anyone have any insight on when the next rakudo release will be? just wondering because 2022.12 + Windows + TAP is borked so github windows-latest tests are failing a lot

[01:23] <jaguart> alternately, is there an easy tweak for github windows workflows?

[04:28] <ugexe> test using the command `zef test . --/tap-harness`?

[04:31] <ugexe> or if TAP has been updated to work, add `zef update TAP`

[12:46] <Nahita> hi is there a way i preapply `$*OUT.out-buffer = False;` before running a script through the command line?

[12:46] <Nahita> similar for $*ERR, like "python -u"

[13:19] *** jpn joined
[13:20] <moritz> raku -e '`$*OUT.out-buffer = False; EVALFILE "yourfile.raku"'

[13:20] <moritz> you could build a generic wrapper script that you can call as `bufferless script args args` or so

[13:23] <leont> ugexe: AFAIK, the problem is not on the TAP side.

[13:27] <Nahita> thank you very much Moritz Lenz

[13:57] <leont> It just occurred to me that Raku's async IO doesn't have a writing-side primitive that supports having backpressure (the way Supplies can do for reading)

[13:58] *** jjido joined
[13:59] <lizmat> yes, that's a known issue afaik

[15:03] <Homer_Simpson> how do I stop the comma editor from pasting NBST

[15:04] <Homer_Simpson> if I copy and past literally almost anything from almost anywhere and paste it into comma I get a load of NBST instead of just spaces

[15:15] <Homer_Simpson> anyone here

[15:22] <lizmat> yeah, some people here

[15:22] <lizmat> not many able to answer that question, I'm afraid

[15:22] <lizmat> sena_kun perhaps

[15:24] <Homer_Simpson> i think i found how to fix it

[15:24] <Homer_Simpson> file encoding  buttom right hand side of screen where it says UTF8 etc

[15:27] <Homer_Simpson> nah it still does it

[15:29] <Homer_Simpson> I have a sub, is there a way to have it included with the built in subs that raku comes with

[15:29] <Homer_Simpson> so I dont need to renember to declare it in every project that I need it used for

[15:31] <lizmat> sorry, /me is too stockholm syndromed to vim

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ```my @list = <ABC DEF GHI>; $string ~~ /@list/;```  (or ```$string ~~ /<@list>/;``` iirc)

[19:13] *** jjido left

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> errr - ok the <@list> form takes a list of matchers, like
