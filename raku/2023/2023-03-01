[10:19] <tadzik> I've stumbled upon this https://mastodon.social/@alexkalopsia/109947169695818290 and I wonder how to reproduce it in Raku – it feels like it should give you nice numbers like that easily, but I can't get it right

[10:19] <tellable6> 2020-03-25T22:48:00Z #raku-dev <patrickb> tadzik: Rakubrew is (slowly) getting to the point of working reliably. What's your stance wrt rakudobrew? Should it officially be deprecated?

[10:23] <lizmat> nah, it isn't ?

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the conversion should happen earlier, right?

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is a situation where an adverb might be nice

[10:25] <lizmat> the size of the printf format should be enough

[10:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> isn't (1 / 998.001) evaluated too early for that?

[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh okay, the precision isn't lost here, it's just not displayed well...

[10:28] <tadzik> it seems to me like it does get lost

[12:13] <thundergnat> Rat.Str(:digits) Huh. That's pretty much what my Rat::Precise module does. https://github.com/thundergnat/Rat-Precise Which, oddly enough isn't showing up on raku.land :-(

[12:13] <thundergnat> It also has a :z flag to preserve trailing zeros, if desired

[12:14] *** thundergnat left
[12:15] <lizmat> TIL

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it doesn't hurt to have something like this in the core, though, does it

[12:19] <lizmat> nope

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl dd &say.WHAT 

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Sub 

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> a Sub containing native code?

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl dd &say 

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Sub say = proto sub say (|) {*} 

[12:26] <lizmat> why the perl there ?

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it gives highlighting (and there is no Raku highlighting on Discord)

[12:26] <lizmat> ah, ok

[12:27] <lizmat> but yeah, "say" is an ordinary multi sub

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> so a sub can contain both moarvm code and native code

[12:30] <lizmat> what makes you think that?

[12:30] <lizmat> a sub is just a Block with a name and a "return" target

[12:31] *** jpn left
[12:32] <lizmat> a Block is a scope with a signature and a list of statements

[12:32] <lizmat> that ultimately results in bytecode to be executed by whatever backend is in use

[12:32] <lizmat> if you run on MoarVM, then it will be moarvm bytecode

[12:33] <lizmat> on JVM, it will be JVM bytecode

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> does multiple dispatch work on sheer Blocks?

[12:33] <lizmat> nope, dispatch is a Sub / Method thikng

[12:33] <lizmat> *thing

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 👍

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> - is native - i thought say is in native code because i assume builtins are written in C and compiled to native code

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> it is not

[12:36] <Geth> ¦ doc: tbrowder++ created pull request #4224: Correct the intended zero-width index entries

[12:36] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4224

[12:36] <lizmat> nope: *NONE* of the core is written in C

[12:36] <lizmat> it is *all* Raku bytecode

[12:36] <lizmat> afk for a bit&

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> really is raku fast enough that writing the core in raku is no longer a liability

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The truth is, a significant t of the core has been rewritten in NQP

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> .s/t/part/

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> NQP is pretty darn fast and completely interoperable with "vanilla" Raku

[12:46] <ugexe> fwiw there is always a cost of having something in the core

[12:46] *** Woodi_ joined
[12:46] <ugexe> if that implementation ends up being wrong in some way that isn't immediately apparent you end up with a php like language where a bunch of the built in functions have "safe" or legit alternatives

[12:48] *** xkr47_ joined
[12:50] <ugexe> also writing the core in something other than raku could been seen as a liability since rakudo can optimize raku, and in the future probably enough so as to be faster than e.g. nqp

[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> PHP has also come a long way since the five 🙂

[12:51] <ugexe> that being said we're obviously not there yet, but porting between nqp <-> raku isn't *that* hard

[12:52] <ugexe> sure, and they still has to have stuff like sql safe or whatever

[12:53] <ugexe> bug compatibility is a real thing

[12:55] <ugexe> to pick on .Str(:digits) for a moment: one might argue it should be a count of *all* digits, one might argue it should only be digits after the decimal

[13:07] <ugexe> but like in regex ① is a digit so theoretically things like FatRat.new(①).Str(...) should be considered (my guess is this already just works because raku is good like that, but it should still have been considered)

[13:08] *** perlbot joined
[13:09] <ugexe> then again i typically paralyze myself when considering all this stuff :P

[13:14] <lizmat> well, thundergnat showed Rat::Precise, and I think that would make an excellent addition to the core

[13:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> again there are very different attitudes to this stuff, bug compatibility and all

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I tend to agree that even something that is arguably a bugfix could in theory mess something up somewhere else, and if it hasn't been specified either way, it's just as much a breaking change as it is a fix

[13:15] <ugexe> i mean people also say zef would make a good addition to the core, which i would also disagree with

[13:17] <lizmat> I can see that: you want to be able to update zef without needing to update the core

[13:17] <ugexe> well, we need the raku programs that we leave behind e.g. previous workplaces to keep working hopefully without anyone having to fix it and get a bad impression. if it wasn't for that i'd mostly be all for not considering bug-compatibility at all

[13:18] <ugexe> well the not just that, but like zef is also things like invoking curl/wget/tar etc in a OS dependant way

[21:53] <rf> I'm not sure what would be the bug here

[21:53] <ugexe> open with :truncate?

[21:54] <Xliff> ugexe: I don't want to clear the contents of the file before I can read them.

[21:54] <Xliff> I also would rather not have to open the file twice.

[21:55] <rf> I think this is just a side-effect of buffered IO

[21:55] <rf> But I could be wrong

[21:55] <Xliff> Right. so the big question is how can I truncate the extra "stTest"

[21:55] <rf> You want that to be removed?

[21:55] <Xliff> Yep.

[21:56] <Xliff> File should end at "!"

[21:57] <Xliff> Note that opening with :truncate leaves the last "TestTestTest" empty. That is not what I want.

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b721f0a04: OUTPUT: «TestTestTest␤BLEAH!␤»

[21:58] <rf> I think there's a way just to clobber the file

[21:58] <rf> with spurt

[21:58] <ugexe> spurt has some other options that open() does, maybe it makes sense for it to have :truncate

[21:59] <rf> m: "/tmp/test".IO.spurt("TestTestTest"); say "/tmp/test".IO.slurp; spurt "/tmp/test", "BLEAH!"; say "/tmp/test".IO.slurp;

[22:01] <Xliff> rf: *sigh* --- Did I mention that the opened file must be locked? Which is why I do not want to perform several file ops. 

[22:01] <Xliff> Sorry if I didn't.

[22:01] * Xliff headdesks

[22:01] <Xliff> ugexe: No, :truncate erases the contents of the file. I need to read that out before the .spurt.

[22:02] <Xliff> IO::Handle.spurt only has :close

[22:03] <ugexe> you would call spurt after you read it obviously

[22:03] <ugexe> and i suggested adding a :truncate option to spurt, not that exists

[22:03] <ugexe> not that it exists^

[22:04] <rf> Maybe using a filehandle is the right approach here

[22:05] <ugexe> yeah it has to be a file handle if you want to do multiple actions on it

[22:05] <ugexe> without reopening it that is

[22:06] <Xliff> Yeah, but there is no .truncate for IO::Handle.

[22:07] <Xliff> No joy using spurt(:truncate)

[22:07] <ugexe> i know, again, i'm *suggesting* it might make sense to have it -- "maybe it makes sense for it to have :truncate"

[22:08] <Xliff> Oh. Yes. Definitely!

[22:08] <Xliff> This... WORKS!

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you know, I mangled with that module a couple of months ago, but I keep forgetting...

[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> have you tried foo<bar>, by the way?

[23:13] <ugexe> normally in template toolkit (dunno about template6) you would just call .key-name

[23:13] <ugexe> i.e. foo.bar

[23:14] *** sena_kun left
[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my first (well, at least third first, lol) impression is that the vast majority of behavior really just comes from EVAL

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so I'd try the most naive way

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> of course it would be better to rewrite it with proper RakuAST code generation but for the time being, I might rewrite the generated pieces of code to heredoc strings at least, it's really convoluted here and there

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is the error, if I may

[23:39] <rf>     [% if meta<description> %] this is the call

[23:39] <coleman> I'm trying to find a compact equivalent of `awk '/foo/ {print $1}'`

[23:39] <coleman> Here's a pastebin https://envs.sh/5y

[23:40] <coleman> I'm doing this wrong. Lmk if you can help :)

[23:40] <rf> @Nemokosch Undeclared routine: meta used at line 15

[23:41] <ugexe> maybe it would parse meta.<description> better 

[23:42] <ugexe> if you can call any existing method you could use AT-KEY

[23:42] <rf> coleman: Try /catalog.+\s/

[23:42] <ugexe> i.e. meta.AT-KEY("description")

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: say '.' ~~ / \w /

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Nil 

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hmmm

[23:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, seems like meta<description> went to the generated code verbatim

[23:46] <rf> coleman: This worked for me /<('catalog'\w+)>/;

[23:46] <coleman> oof

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or at least this is how I can reproduce the behavior by reading the logic

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for the catalog stuff - if the whole thing is one string, you could just ignore the original logic, break up the whole thing into words and grep on that, no?

[23:48] <coleman> rf: thank you very much :)

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that wouldn't be an equivalent for sure but it would get the job done

[23:48] <cfa> wouldn't the actual equvalent be .lines on the slurp, then grepping for a pattern?

[23:49] <cfa> m: "catalog-6987bf74cc-xhfnq    2/2     Running   0             136m\n controlensemble-0           3/3     Running   2 (27h ago)   28h\n dashboard-dff795cdc-cg5jg   2/2     Running   0             134m\n edge-7894f45d6b-2kzdt       1/1     Running   0             28h\n greymatter-datastore-0      2/2     Running   0             136m\n".lines.grep(/catalog/).say

[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar b721f0a04: OUTPUT: «(catalog-6987bf74cc-xhfnq    2/2     Running   0             136m)␤»

[23:51] <coleman> lines would be closer to awk, which defaults to splitting on lines...

[23:52] <rf> Hmm, Nemo it seems like it wants meta to be a sub rather than a map

[23:52] <coleman> i'll report back if i find something succinct

[23:53] *** derpydoo left
[23:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> rf: yes, that's not surprising on one hand... on the other hand, I'm afraid %meta<description> won't magically fix that

[23:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because the generated functions have their own "stash"

[23:54] <cfa> i guess /^^.*catalog.*?$$/

[23:54] <cfa> might do the job too

[23:54] <cfa> match a line with catalog in it

[23:55] <cfa> for all matches you'd need m:g/^^.*catalog.*?$$/

[23:57] <rf> I guess I may need to do some hacking on Template6
