[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> custom operators are super slow to start up, is there anyway to precompile them or something?

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> seems like it's just the circumfix operator

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> i love this language so much

[12:40] *** jpn joined
[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> now if only i could make a custom operator do word quoting

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @sushi I assume you want unary operator. (Instead of using the Q-lang.)

[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> i would like to be able to define something like  sub prefix:<`>(*@a) {...} and use it like `my words to pass;  instead of `<my words to pass>;

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah that sounds beyond what operators can do

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> basically you want to create a slang

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @sushi Hmm... you might be able to do this: ` my words to pass;  , say, using RakuAST.

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> ah not worth it for the little script im writing

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> ill have to look into it sometime thoguh

[22:08] <Xliff> Hi. I want to create a Promise that runs a piece of code that I can kick off at a later date.

[22:08] <tbrowder__> ok, what is the easy way with raku to copy a file. docs specify copying a path to a path. so to copy file "a/foo" to dir "b" we have to "copy a/foo, b/foo".  what a pain. why can't raku "copy a/foo, b/"?

[22:09] <Xliff> tbrowder: Why not make a sub?

[22:09] <Xliff> sub copyFile ($a, $b) { $a.IO.copy($b) }

[22:09] <Xliff> $a and $b are filenames

[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder  " @Anton Antonov a sensitive question on yr recent speech in russia, any sense of Russian  scientists' opinions on invasion?" -- The conference I attended (and gave presentation at) was in St. Petersburg, Russia, but I did my participation online. (I think 95% attended in person) So, it is somewhat difficult for me to judge what people think about the invasion, without having my own biases and

[22:31] <discord-raku-bot> preconceptions.

[22:33] <Xliff> m: sub a { say 42 }; my @a = (); a( |@a )

[22:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51b0afc4b: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[22:40] <tbrowder__> Xliff: ah, a sub, that's a good idea,

[22:41] <tbrowder__> antonantonov: thanks, i assumed you were there for some reason

[22:45] <tbrowder__> Xliff: i'll try it but i don't think it will work with dirs

[22:47] *** Voldenet left
[22:47] <tbrowder__> this is a kludge one-liner: copy $patha, "$somedir/{$patha.IO.basename}"

[22:48] <tbrowder__> that works, but making that a sub is a good idea. but still, raku should handle it better

[22:49] <tbrowder__> i think i filed an issue long ago and it got shot down

[22:53] *** Voldenet joined
[22:56] *** jpn joined
[22:57] <tbrowder__> no, i didn't. so what do ppl think about having raku's "copy" allow coping to a directory? posix does, why not raku?

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Thank you for your interest! üôÇ

[23:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I am "in the middle" of using "Text::Utils".

[23:42] <tbrowder__>  antononcube: i bought wolfram‚Äôs giant book not long after it came out. i thought he had solved the universe with his magic. you have piqued my interest again in the wolfram products. prices have come down a lot and the relations/transforms you‚Äôve shown between raku and wolfram are intriguing.

[23:47] <tbrowder__> i know a woman who uses an excel spreadsheet in weird ways to create weekly schedules for our local senior center. i tried to help her with automating some of the process with raku but didn‚Äôt have much luck. wolframs ability to wrangle data from multiple binary sources may make a relook worthwhile.

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Yes, WL can help. I just released today another version of the WL paclet "DataReshapers":  https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/DataReshapers/ .

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder My point is actually, that WL has a more general take on what datasets are -- they do not consider tabular data that important. (At least initially.) Hence, I have been make some paclets and presentations on how to streamline data wrangling in WL.

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, I apply the same workflows in Raku too.
