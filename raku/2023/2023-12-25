[02:13] <Xliff_> .seen vushu

[02:13] <tellable6> Xliff_, I saw vushu 2023-12-21T06:20:00Z in #raku: <.vushu> @melezhik it works now thank you ! https://ci.sparrowhub.io/report/3855 üôÇ

[02:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I plan to troll vushu and ab5tract soon.

[02:15] <Xliff_> .tell vushu I have started with the creation of an OO interface for Raylib::Bindings. Please check out my fork on the oo-interface branch @ https://github.com/Xliff/raylib-raku -- I have beefed up the number of examples in the examples/ dir

[02:15] <tellable6> Xliff_, I'll pass your message to .vushu

[02:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Does your package work on macOS ?

[02:25] <Xliff_> If Raylib::Bindings does, then mine should.

[02:26] <Xliff_> antoncube: How are you planning on trolling? lol

[02:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> With better, more interesting, multi-layered snowfall animation that completely does not use "raylib".

[02:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And, yes, I have had problems installing "Raylib::Bindings" in the past.

[05:32] <Xliff_> antoncube: Raylib isn't that bad, really.

[05:32] <Xliff_> It is a bit annoying to install, though. There are instructions for OSX.

[05:56] *** Xliff_ left
[06:37] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @Xliff wow this is so cool! really impressive work! Is it possible to make it import/use Raylib::Bindings::OO  which also imports all the OO wrappers like Color, Vector, Rectangle, etc, so as a user I only have to import Raylib::Bindings::OO, to explicit state that now we are using the OO interface.

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract "did I do something to bother you? why do you seem to be gunning for me?" -- Obviously, because you did not bother me enough!  You would have, if you used any of the Raku LLM packages.

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, if I make better snowfall than yours, then you might be more incentified...

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, I was very impressed by the simple snowfall animation Mathematica code here: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/16889 . So, I wanted to replicated with Raku.

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the related animation:

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is why I implemented two new distributions in "Data::Generators". (BernoulliDistribution and BinomialDistribution .) And I plan to make a new package for transforming data with convolution and other data transformations. (Like window smoothing, etc.)

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu The "mathematically drawn" snowflakes is something that can be done in Raku already. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNnofZEAn4

[20:31] <Xliff> And Merry Christmas, #raku and all rakoons everywhere.

[20:33] <Xliff> vushu - Once done, I think it becomes a matter of simply moving all of the OO compunits to the OO namespace, then writing a Raku::Bindings::OO that will just "need" all of the OO compunits.

[20:33] <Xliff> I think it's doable!
