[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: I have refactored the Contact code (both the gh repo and the advent post) to sidestep the "circular use" impression previous version gave - I had to deschedule the wp post to make the updates ... please can you reschedule it?

[12:15] <lizmat> librasteve done

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ta!

[12:43] <tbrowder__> ugexe: i'm having zef report tests good on a devel distro in situ but it fails when i try to install it from its home repo. with zef --debug i can see the failing tests but i'm having trouble seeing why it would be different.

[12:45] <tbrowder__> the tests do involve using tempdir and unlinking test files and counting same before and after testing, so maybe there is something there i'm not considering

[12:46] <tbrowder__> but, what is different about the two test environments from zef's perspective?

[12:58] <tbrowder__> oops, i see the problem, it's the old (and incorrect) use of ?RESOURCES after installation. fix should be easy after you showed the correct way to do it

[17:30] <tbrowder__> ref: HowToUseModuleResources,i have solved the last piece of the puzzle: how to install executables in resources

[17:31] *** jpn left
[17:33] <tbrowder__> briefly: get the bin file's contents, spurt it to a /usr/local/bin/myprog file, chmod the file with 0o755, and use it

[17:35] <tbrowder__> that's on linux, procedure may change on mac and win

[17:37] *** dakkar left
[17:38] <tbrowder__> i haven't yet determined best way to handle sudo requirement

[17:39] <[Coke]> aren't executables automatically installed along with bin scripts?

[17:39] <[Coke]> and permissions automatically handled by that?

[17:41] <tbrowder__> yes, but i have a special case that requires a system file and i don't want it as a regular user bin file

[17:42] <[Coke]> that is, you have to make things executable, sure, but you do that on the copy in bin/ and those perms are copied - as far as sudo goes, if you need sudo, you run zef with sudo, not spawn a command from zef with sudo

[17:43] <[Coke]> I would be upset if you installed something into /usr/local from zef if I was installing to a specific install dir.

[17:44] <tbrowder__> hm, good points, maybe i got lost in the weeds :-(

[17:44] <tbrowder__> i'll have to look closer at my use case

[17:46] <[Coke]> Sure, not trying to shoot you down, more to understand.

[17:48] <tbrowder__> my thought was to hide the special executable because (1) is isn't designed to be used directly and (2) it's probably not easily availaable

[17:48] <tbrowder__> available as a system file.

[17:49] <[Coke]> is it something you can have a native dependency on ?

[17:49] <[Coke]> like we depend on `dot` in one of the docs modules?

[17:51] *** dbonnafo2 joined
[17:51] <tbrowder__> i'm not sure, but putting the bin file in HOME/.bin or other such place would be better and not require sudo.

[17:51] <tbrowder__> thanks for the excellent reality check!

[17:53] <tbrowder__> btw, my wife is now excited about a Mac Air for Christmas and i'll be able to ssh in to it (i hope)

[17:58] <lizmat> Settings -> Sharing

[17:58] <[Coke]> I love the M2 macbook I got, very happy with it.

[17:59] <[Coke]> I've heard similarly good things about recent Airs!

[18:00] <tbrowder__> getting an m1

[18:01] <[Coke]> nice.

[18:01] <tbrowder__> 2020

[18:01] <[Coke]> "they're all good macs, bront."

[18:02] <tbrowder__> ok, so says my son

[18:02] <[Coke]> :)

[18:12] <tbrowder__> i went looking for the file again and its site is not responding. it came from a SUSE developer and i'm not even sure it's in their packages. file is "ttf-converter.py"

[18:17] <tbrowder__> the $HOME bin file placement should work. i'll put it in ~/.bin unless anyone has a better non-system location for a python script

[18:21] <tbrowder__> it converts PostScript .pfb font files to TrueType .ttf format

[18:23] <[Coke]> same place you'd install the raku scripts?

[18:24] <[Coke]> then there's no worries about making sure ~/.bin exists or is writable

[18:24] <[Coke]> I think that would be "slightly odd" but ok.
