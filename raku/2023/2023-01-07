[07:35] <jaguart> So as the Pod::Loader etc. seem in flux... I've switched to my $handle = CompUnit::Loader.load-source-file( $source-file.IO );

[07:35] <jaguart> and I can get the Pod directly from the $handle.unit without having to tweak the source and EVAL it...

[07:36] <jaguart> which seems nice, fast and simple... just one issue - if I load a module before doing this, and then attempt to get the pod for that module...

[07:37] <jaguart> I get a compile 'Redeclaration of symbol

[07:38] <jaguart> is there a way to get the compile() to skip the merge into GLOBAL:: ? or to get it to merge into a transient Stash?

[21:07] <grondilu> it fails but with no error, and the window shows up, with the correct bg color.

[21:07] <grondilu> I suspect the issue is with a Pointer I set at some point.

[21:08] <grondilu> what is NativeCall's equivalent to C<(void *)0> ?  Pointer.new?
