[11:34] <leont> Now that's a new error for me: ¬´No such method 'mixin' for invocant of type 'Perl6::Metamodel::CurriedRoleHOW'¬ª.
[11:38] <leont> I think that is a bug? Not being able to do ¬´Role[Arg] but Other¬ª
[11:42] <lizmat> gist?
[11:43] *** jpn joined
[11:48] *** jpn left
[11:51] <leont> Oh, "but" is not allowed in roles in general? I hadn't expected that.
[11:52] <lizmat> maybe: Role[Arg].^pun but Other

[12:24] <tbrowder__> [Coke]: what do you think about formalizing yr windows gist into the docs some place as a goto read for windows ppl? much better than a link on github.
[12:46] <leont> Yeah, .^pun worked fine, but the left hand can just easily be an object. Worked around it by writing a wrapper type instead of mixing in, but I am wondering if but shouldn't autopun its left hand side.

[12:55] <lizmat> leont: I guess some logic in infix:<but> would cover that indeed
[12:55] <[Coke]> tbrowder__: Sure, the gist was only for the WIP. 
[12:56] <[Coke]> next easy step would be to move it to a wiki page or someplace on raku.org
[12:56] <[Coke]> if you think it's helpfuul in its current form, go for it.

[23:39] <guifa> tbrowder (or whoever it was): One thing I did to deprecate a module (or at least a reference style to it) was to have a warning in INIT mentioning why it was deprecated and a potential alternate usage (with an acknowledgement that they may get the message if a module that's being used uses mine).  Just leave that as the last version and move on I think is best
