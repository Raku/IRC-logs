[21:34] <hellwolf> Howdy folks, I post what I posted on matrix here instead: 

[21:34] <hellwolf> I am a returned perl5 user and feeling nostalgic and exploring if I should use raku for an otherwise shell-scripting mostly glue script (templating some temporary files, call a transpiler pipeline, gather results, and tidy everything up)

[21:34] <hellwolf> ... few days later ...

[21:35] <hellwolf> for the lol, I did the thing I asked in bash instead for now. But I asked chatgpt4 to rewrite it in Raku instead:

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> please, for the love of God, do not use bash

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if we all stop using it, we might be able to achieve a common evolutionary step towards actual engineering disciplines

[23:10] <jdv> bash, the gnu bash shell?

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> any POSIX compatible shell, bash is simply too known among them, even though it's about the best in this miserable competition

[23:16] <jdv> ok
