[11:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> asking mi6 users: is there no way to turn off README regeneration completely?

[11:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm confused

[11:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd like to just keep it as it is, neither disabling "readmefrompod", nor outright deleting that section seems to help, it will just empty the file

[11:20] *** buildable6 left
[11:20] <lizmat> add "enabled = false" to the [ReadmeFromPod] section?

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> one really annoying thing about TAP is that it just reports "there were errors" when the test actually throws

[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm getting the idea that snitch has special importance with Junctions

[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you think about it, it's not really easy to perform inline operations on eigenvalues of Junctions

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> given? nope, binds to the Junction. .&{ ... } ? binds. andthen? also binds

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> map doesn't bind but it's kind of a hack relying that all individual values can be treated as a list, and the result of the operation won't be nice

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; (1|2|3).snitch({ say $_**2 < 4 })

[12:32] <evalable6> nemokosch, rakudo-moar f45297d57: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§False‚ê§False‚ê§¬ª

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 No such method 'snitch' for invocant of type 'Int'   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, that bot is older, the other one produced it nicely

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the problem is that snitch obviously won't allow for useful return values in the callback so I might still hack it with map...

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hm, maybe given with a type constraint can help? üòº

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: say do given (1|2|3) -> Any $_ { $_ ** 2 < 4}

[12:37] <evalable6> nemokosch, rakudo-moar f45297d57: OUTPUT: ¬´any(True, False, False)‚ê§¬ª

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  any(True, False, False) 

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ok .<min> <= (.<mean>&.<median>) <= .<max> given %result; - this felt clever

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ok do given %result.all.value -> Any $_ {     .<min> <= (.<mean>&.<median>) <= .<max> }; 

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this feels a little crazy

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean, not for the same thing

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> here, there are several tests "at once", all living in the values of the hash

[14:42] <jdv> is there supposed to be a sidebar in the new docs site?

[14:43] <jdv> having to scroll/find a type is kinda annoying

[14:44] <jdv> i mean scroll/find on a type's page

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> There is a sidebar

[14:57] <jdv> do i have to do something to see it?

[14:58] <jdv> also, why are there 2 scrollbars. makes it awkward scrolling sometimes.

[14:59] <jdv> looks the same in ff and chrome...

[15:01] *** jpn_ left
[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> You need to open the sidebar

[15:03] <jdv> interesting.  the old site had it there by default i think.  the UI could be better.  thanks.

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well, it always could. I think it is already better than it used to be

[15:04] *** jpn joined
[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> There are situations where resolving an issue creates another one; the double scrollbar is such a case

[15:06] <jdv> i don't think so, in that specific regard imho

[15:06] <jdv> one would think the majority case for people hitting the docs is to find something and the sidebar can be a big part of that

[15:07] <jdv> so its just slower and a bit hidden atm

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The sidebar is a bit useless on phone to begin with

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Previously, the site was barely usable on phone, now that i think of it

[15:14] <jdv> who's coding on their phone?

[15:14] <jdv> haha

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> You wouldn't believe how many ridiculous complaints the doc team is facing

[15:15] <jdv> its nice that the ui is responsive but prioritizing a minority use case seems LTA

[15:16] <jdv> cool

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Having said that, previously it was outright useless. That's a bit different

[15:16] <jdv> i used to use the old site all the time and it was fine for me

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> You'd have to scroll down the whole "sidebar" to see anything

[15:17] <jdv> on a phone or a regular screen?

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The scrolling of the sidebar also wasn't fine, on PC either

[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It was somehow linked to the content, all scrolled or none
