[13:39] <jaguart> It's 32C in Sussex UK - with no aircon - just not used to that!

[13:40] <lizmat> 30 here in NL, now officially the hottest Sep 6

[13:40] <lizmat> the coming 6 days will probably all break records as well

[13:40] <jaguart> whew

[13:42] <jaguart> I've been away for a while - BSc Info Tech squeezed into 12 weeks. Enough javascript and C# - now I'm back to Raku!

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah long time no see

[14:13] <jaguart> I'm looking forward to playing with this: https://github.com/bduggan/raku-jupyter-kernel

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> have you followed the Rakudoc news?

[14:14] <jaguart> a little - but not in earnest

[14:14] <jaguart> what did I miss?

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know, to be frank. It just seemed you might be interested.

[14:14] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/380

[14:14] <jaguart> :)

[14:15] <lizmat> more specifically: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/RakuDoc-GAMMA/main/rakudoc_draft_3.rakudoc

[14:16] <jaguart> I had so many assignments my head was down the whole time. Kept promoting raku as a better OO than C# to the profs/tutors

[14:17] <jaguart> I did read about the pod6 changes - looking forward to seeing how it evolves

[14:18] <jaguart> I'm guessing my niggles with minor POD6 bugs will evaporate

[14:22] <jaguart> The big thing I really want is auto generation of class documentation a'la JavaDoc - but that seems orthoganal to raku-doc

[14:22] *** evalable6 left
[14:22] *** linkable6 left
[14:23] <lizmat> jaguart: you mean, generate from code?   yes, that would be orthogonal

[14:26] *** deoac left
[14:26] <jaguart> yes - it's on my todo list

[14:27] <jaguart> I do like the raku-doc =COLUMN - that is really nice

[14:27] *** deoac joined
[14:27] <lizmat> well, with RakuAST it would definitely be simpler, as you wouldn't need to parse the code yourself, but could use the .AST

[14:27] <lizmat> "file".IO.slurp.AST   basically

[14:31] <jaguart> I'm assuming the AST branch is not main yet?

[14:33] <jaguart> https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/language/rakudoc - wow, a superb job on this! 

[14:34] <[Coke]> https://packy.dardan.com/2023/09/05/perl-weekly-challenge-whats-the-frequency-kenneth/ - another blog post with a raku solution to the weekly

[14:34] <[Coke]> jaguart: it is, but you need to activate it with 'use experimental :rakuast'

[14:36] <[Coke]> m: use experimental :rakuast; $*PROGRAM.AST.say

[14:37] <jaguart> will look at dropping that into my introspection widget

[14:38] <[Coke]> ... ok, that worked with -e locally, but is very unhappy when I save it in a file. substitute real code for the $*PROGRAM there. :)

[14:46] <[Coke]> lizmat: wait, the experimental isn't needed?

[14:47] <lizmat> the :experimental is only needed if you want to directly access / create RakuAST classes

[14:47] <lizmat> .AST makes them for you

[14:47] <[Coke]> Ahhhhh

[14:47] <[Coke]> Apologies

[14:48] <lizmat> I mean as soon as you want to check for specific nodes in the .AST result, you would need the :experimental

[14:48] <lizmat> *or* "use v6.e.PREVIW"

[15:49] <[Coke]> nerd friends: don't assume someone's mailing address is their shipping address.

[15:50] <[Coke]> My mom's town doesn't have a post office, so the mailing address is the next town over, but so many online delivery places are trying to convert the address to a mailing address (probably because that's what they had to validate against)
