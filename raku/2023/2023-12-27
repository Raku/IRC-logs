[08:20] <melezhik> have successfully installed openssl using brew
[08:21] <melezhik> and have no issues with installing IO::Socket::Async::SSL , OpenSSL modules
[08:21] <melezhik> only have an issue with Cro::TLS

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube  I have added full fen notation now, now the action returns a Result object containing the ranks and state info.
[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> it should be upload in raku.land shortly
[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @.vushu  Great! I will update ‚ÄúJavaScript::D3‚Äù to have its function js-d3-chessboard take FEN strings as arguments later today.
[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @antononcube nice looking forward to it üòÅ
[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Please install that package and try the chessboard demo script: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/JavaScript::D3
[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the script: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-JavaScript-D3/blob/main/examples/Chessboard-demo.raku
[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @.vushu Ideally, at some point you will install one of "Jupyter::Kernel" or "Jupyter::Chatbook" and try those chessboard generations there.

[16:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is how it looks in a Jupyter notebook with Visual Studio Code.

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> that looks really awesome ü§©
[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks! My problem is that is very non trivial to export D3.js graphs or plots to images (image files.)
[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is my biggest impediment for making -- and documenting -- more streamlined chess-based workflows with Raku.
[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But being able to directly put FEN strings into the chessboard making functions is really useful for documentation and demo purposes!
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I believe it‚Äôs quite a big task to integrate it. Im glad that you find it useful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Honestly, I am not that interested myself, but a fair amount of people really want to see and discuss LLM-and-chess related computations. (I might be repeating myself here.) So, I am trying to do the "public service" and get more attention to my packages.
[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @.vushu Does the FEN parser work on multiple FEN strings? I am not sure is it a good idea to have that at grammar level.
[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But for example, for a sequence of FEN strings you can get a sequence of FEN::Result objects. And then make a "group chessboard plot."
[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> it only works on one string at a time
[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Im guessing you are worried about the parsing speed of grammar?
[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... sorry, that is not important. I can handle it at  the "visualization level." What is more needed for me is to have a Hash for chess-coordinate to piece representation. I will submit an issue.
