[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the raku.org rework is looking quite good so far, only minor issues, although I can imagine that a certain one will turn out to be more complicated

[16:12] <lizmat> is there a preview?

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Well, there is not much to view. The current aim is to reproduce the same pages.

[16:16] <lizmat> ack, ok  :-)

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> let me ask this again: do we know anything about the infrastructure side, how it is deployed and how should the required modules be installed?

[16:17] <lizmat> no, actually I don't, but people on #raku-infra should know

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> roger, I will ask

[19:55] <JohnLaw> this is the function for calculating the Walsh matrix.

[19:55] <JohnLaw> but when I type it into the interpter it truncates the output if it is large.

[19:55] <JohnLaw> how to make it print it all?

[19:55] <JohnLaw> like for f(4)

[19:56] <JohnLaw> [10] > f(3)

[19:56] <JohnLaw> is ok cause it is small enough.

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> yeah it shows the gist of it

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> lizmat made an environment option recently

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> like .gist

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> you can .raku for more

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> an environment option that lets you set how the REPL stringifies by default

[19:58] <JohnLaw> ok, I just downloaded this.  Any more clues would be great

[19:58] <JohnLaw> but thanks

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> .raku always works but hang tight, I'm gonna check this environmental variable, I don't remember the name...

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> RAKU_REPL_OUTPUT_METHOD

[20:02] <JohnLaw> what do I do with that string?

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> how do you start the repl?

[20:03] <JohnLaw> I have a thing on my task bar for Radudo REPL

[20:03] <JohnLaw> I just punch it

[20:03] <JohnLaw> then this window pops up and I define my function, f

[20:03] <JohnLaw> then I type f(4)

[20:03] <JohnLaw> and it eats it

[20:05] *** silug left
[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah I don't know if it's convenient to set an environment variable, then...

[20:05] <JohnLaw> I can try, what do I set?

[20:05] <JohnLaw> varialbe and value?

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> RAKU_REPL_OUTPUT_METHOD to raku

[20:06] <JohnLaw> ok will do thanks

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the default value is "gist", hence the difference

[20:06] <JohnLaw> that explains why this used to work long ago when I wrote my article.

[21:02] <tbrowder__> i can't top JohnLaw's spoof, but i would like to revisit using Rakudo and zef on a multi-user Linux system.

[21:04] <tbrowder__> i would like to have root maintain the rakudo installation for all users (but each can of course have their own setup if desired).

[21:05] <gfldex> That's what I do.

[21:05] <tbrowder__> the problems i have had are keeping separate zef installations for root and other users.

[21:07] <tbrowder__> i have been using the rakudo-pkg installation method for many years now, but i unfortunatl

[21:07] *** bdju left
[21:07] <gfldex> I didn't have trouble with that so far but would consider it not well tested. zef does a fairly good job to keep things separate.

[21:07] <tbrowder__> *unfortunately i seem to mix them.

[21:08] *** bdju joined
[21:08] <tbrowder__> which causes all kinds of problems.

[21:10] <tbrowder__> actually there is only on host with a problem. i'm going to purge rakudo and root's zef and start over.

[21:11] <tbrowder__> also i don't really understand debian's new way of handling sudo users and that hasn't helped the situation.

[21:13] <tbrowder__> if that doesn't cure my problem, i'll be back.

[21:24] <tbrowder__> gfldex: do you use debian?

[21:27] <tbrowder__> regardless, how do you execute zef as root? (1) "sudo zef ..." or (2) "sudo su; zef ..." or (3) some other way?

[21:30] <gfldex> I do use debian and I build Rakudo from source and I don't use sudo at all. I don't need to blur the line between root and users, so I don't.

[21:31] <gfldex> If I need scripts to do root-stuff, I write a demon.
