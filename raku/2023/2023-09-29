[00:18] <AlexDaniel> nemokosch: it's not too strange that it changed, I think the version on the server was a bit outdated compared to the repo and the bot didn't know the name of the bridge bot

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> the functionality is still cool, if you want to ensure that the message gets noticed, you can .tell over the bridge

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> I open discord once every few months so I don't keep up with all the notifications

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this bridge even turns usernames into tags

[00:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if the logger is able to figure out that I'm online on Discord and won't just practically double the messages whenever somebody uses it, then it's fine

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> if somebody .tells explicitly, then the behavior is the same

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> for users over the bridge there's no auto-.tell

[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I hope that's true because it wasn't true previously

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> when's that? :)

[00:28] <AlexDaniel> ahh, those messages

[00:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> those messages predominantly came from "IRC tags", not .tell calls

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> yeahâ€¦ maybe at the time when you were on IRC? I don't knowâ€¦ I'm not sure

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> but clearly there would have been a lot more messages if this was a consistent problem, hmmm

[00:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but... why would it .tell right when I am at IRC? this doesn't add up either way

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> if you're on IRC but then leave and switch to discord, then it'd still remember you as an IRC user

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> until your next discord message

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> At some point, this stacking up was a regular sight

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> oh

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't mind if the resolution is that it simply won't save messages as it apparently used to

[12:20] <NemokoschKiwi> Patrick Michaud is such a respectable and humble person that it's really hard to just tell him what I have been thinking for quite a while now

[12:22] <NemokoschKiwi> Namely that everything I have seen from him in discussions on Github more or less directly reassured or contributed to the messy and hard to approach nature of the Raku community

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jerome70 I donâ€™t think so.

[12:45] <tellable6> 2022-11-12T14:05:06Z #raku <tbrowder> antononcube: can you get a centered string in Markdown?

[12:45] <tellable6> 2023-07-11T11:47:58Z #raku <tbrowder__> antononcube can you say what os and supporting equip you're using for producing your mathematica and raku work as shown in article above? thnx

[12:45] <tellable6> 2023-09-11T10:27:51Z #raku <tbrowder__> antononcube A debian man gave me a bash script used to mock xclip. Maybe you can figure out how to use it for github testing for Raku::Clipboard. I'll gist it here later.

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jerome70 In general, Rakuâ€™s data ingestion capabilities from data science perspective are not that great. I personally very rarely use parquet, so it is not in my TODO list to work on related Raku readers/writers. ðŸ™‚

[12:51] *** NemokoschKiwi left
[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I donâ€™t think I have seen (and answered) the Markdown question of yours: Markdown should be able to center-align a string using HTML specs. As far as know native Markdown does not support alignment specs.

[13:04] *** ab5tract left
[13:25] <tbrowder__> correct, it doesn't. too bad.

[13:26] <tbrowder__> at least i haven't found that it can.

[13:33] <Voldenet> markdown was designed with extreme simplicity in mind, but it can be quickly converted to html which can be adjusted later

[13:34] <Voldenet> whenever I needed something slightly more advanced than markdown, I went path of just writing html

[13:34] <Voldenet> s/went/chose/

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rakudoc! ðŸ˜„

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but yeah HTML is solid tech for a great variety of things

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> from the XAML-ish use case to documents

[16:08] <tbrowder__> um, xml is horrible for ppl to use.

[16:08] *** perlbot joined
[16:10] <tbrowder__> i was wrking fr dod contractor when they discovered xml as the solution for everything, yuck

[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> heya, so is there any reason the action corressponding to a grammar would produce Nil, for context I have an action that looks like method dot ($/) { make Dot } where Dot is a role definition that looks like role Dot does Token {}, now when I'm parsing this via the grammar, it produces Nil as opposed to Dot

[16:17] <Voldenet> XML is horrible, but html is hardly xml

[16:25] <tbrowder__> well, not much better for a markup language imho

[16:25] <tbrowder__> but that's a personal pref, i really prefer rakupod

[16:27] <tbrowder__> in a variant i hope the new raku doc team proposes before too long

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hello, right back at you...

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I just wanted to add that HTML is mostly XML-compatible and iirc this is a very typical scenario of "how you use it"

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I remember that a creator of SGML criticized XML for being too bloated which was funny because SGML was basically a superset of XML

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and eventually the criticism was mostly about the way XML is often used, i.e it is too bloated for data

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> while iirc SGML was intended to describe documents

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> > role Dot does Token {} I can't see anything called Token, where does that come from?

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> uh thats a role defined in the same module

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> although I think I've figured out the issue

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> I use a longest match alternation rule called tok which has no corresponding action

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> now I'm not sure how to get the made value from it

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> made is just an attribute attached to the match, right?

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> yeah but that seems to be nil in this case

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> method tok ($/) { say $/.made } when I run this I just get Nil printed

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> wait let me put the entire thing onto a paste service

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> https://paste.myst.rs/hpih91dz

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> huh, I'm starting to understand the idea

[16:49] *** ab5tract left
[16:49] *** ab5tract joined
[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and how do you invoke it?

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore>  my $match = Lex::Lexer.parse('.', actions => Lex::Tokenizer); say $match.made;

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> just the usual way

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> > Match.new(:orig("."), :from(0), :pos(1), :hash(Map.new((:dot(Match.new(:orig("."), :from(0), :pos(1), :made(1)))))))

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> dd $match<tok>[0]

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that :made is at an interesting place...

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> I don't know how to read that ðŸ˜…

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> dd $match<tok>[0].<dot>.made;

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay... this is indeed 1

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think something went wrong with the nesting

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> right so from some debug printing

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> inside the tok method, the match has the value set for whatever was parsed

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> so say a . was encountered $<dot> is set

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> one would expect the tok itself having the ast set

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but that clearly doesn't

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> yeah I suppose, but something about the alternation regex messes that up

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there are things that it does seem to mess up but this would be too much...

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but now that you mentioned it - have you considered turning tok into a proto?

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> that causes issues with uh parsing multiples

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> that was my original solution

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> but it causes some weird infinite loop(?) as in it would just infinitely do nothing when I tried to run it

[17:08] *** Guest82 left
[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, I think the problem is simply that the action of tok itself should make the link to whichever rule matched

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I guess this is really why protos were invented ðŸ˜…

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> like one can hardcode make $<dot>.made in method tok but that doesn't really scale well ðŸ˜„

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the other way I've seen in people's code is that they add this imperative handling straight into the token

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> without any parser class

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ... which doesn't mean that I could do it right

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> let me try to turn it into a proto anyway

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <rikashore> okay, if you get something do ping me! It's getting late here and i need to hop off

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, sure

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I've definitely gotten somewhere

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @rikashore https://gist.github.com/2colours/94f345b3bd2e60238f8ee96832dcfdd5 can you read it?

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I made it into a monolith but other than that I think you can see how I modified the grammar and the parser

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and this does give me [Dot]
