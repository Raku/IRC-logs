[07:35] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Hi .Xliff thanks, I see there are some issues, I saw you have forked the repo, the thing is the Bindings.rakumod is more the result of the action, so to add your changes we need to fix the action to generate the right Bindings.
[07:41] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> .lizmat thanks for fixing the code example and typos üôÇ

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Is this sufficient?
[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is this uppercase HAS?
[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I think it's preferred for value types, in the docs it say it's getting embedded in the class, meaning it has it default instantiate i think  https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#Embedding_CStructs_and_CUnions_with_HAS
[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ahh gotcha
[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not easy to look up...
