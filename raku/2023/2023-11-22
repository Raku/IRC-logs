[21:17] <Xliff> I know I've asked this before, but I want to ask it again given that it's been a while:

[21:18] <Xliff> If I have a RakuAST Tree. Can I render that tree to byte-code, store away somewhere, then reload that blob into memory in another module and execute it?

[21:18] <Xliff> If that answer is a "no" now, are there plans on making it a "yes" in the future?

[21:19] <Xliff> antoncube: Nice! Did you create these using AI? If so, what service did you use?

[21:23] *** jpn left
[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Instead of bytecode, i would just suggest any sort of serialization of the RakuAST structure

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Hey folks, I'm making a web app and automatically restarting it whenever the code changes. The (pre-)compilation stage seems to take quite a while. Runtime performance is good enough. Is there anything I should look into to improve this? I looked at --profile-compile but I didn't see anything obvious there.

[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I'm already trying to refactor the code to be more modular and also thinking about faster hardware.

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Curious if there's some setting to reduce optimization at precomp that I can set while developing

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> For reference it takes approximately 30 seconds if I change a really deep dependency. Usually it's closer to 10-15 seconds.
