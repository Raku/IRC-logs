[08:15] <leont> Suddenly mi6 isn't working well anymore. First it creates a .precomp in the root dir, and then it complains about a dirty git state. I can fix that with .gitignore, but that a test fails that doesn't fail when running raku -Ilib or prove6 -l.

[08:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> > a test fails that doesn't fail when running raku -Ilib or prove6 -l. I would rather try to fix that
[08:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but I can't reproduce the problem. I don't have PAUSE. Added .precomp to the .gitignore, ran mi6 build and prove6 -l, it was all fine

[09:17] <leont> v2023.06. Mi6 3.0.2 (latest). I don't understand it either.
[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the only difference is that I'm on v2023.04 Rakudo
[09:44] <leont> Apparently I can reproduce it without the -Ilib, but why would mi6 do that?

[11:11] <tbrowder__> ugexe: i have a module from another author that needs LibraryMake for linux and macos but NOT windows. he is trying to track down the source of that dependency. in the meantime i asked this question.
[11:12] <leont> Yeah. Happens during compilation too, so I can't easily reduce it or anything.
[11:12] *** razetime joined
[11:16] <tbrowder__> leont: which module is being tested?
[11:42] *** hythm joined
[11:44] <hythm> tbrowder, may be you need something like this https://github.com/azawawi/raku-file-which/blob/master/META6.json#L10

[13:09] <ugexe> you can optionally include modules as dependencies, but you still have to be anywhere they are used won't get run on e.g. linux
[13:10] <ugexe> you can see what that entails in the full commit of File::Which - https://github.com/azawawi/raku-file-which/commit/83eef687831ec9143ca9b7e5b11ec1b8f71fb23e
[13:12] <ugexe> still have to be anywhere = still have to be aware that anywhere
[13:14] <ugexe> basically a conditional dependency implies that it will also be included in the code conditionally
[13:21] *** NemokoschKiwi joined
[13:21] <ugexe> leont: is it failing its only test (which is literally pass "happy hacking!";)?
[13:23] *** NemokoschKiwi left
[13:28] *** siavash left
[13:38] <ugexe> leont: also are you using it on App::Mi6? I suppose there might be something going on with the fact that App::Mi6 uses TAP (probably an installed version) but also is trying to load the dev libraries (-I., -Ilib) for whatever distribution it is currently processing (which might be TAP itself)
[13:38] <ugexe> using it on App::Mi6 = using it on TAP
[13:39] <ugexe> https://github.com/skaji/mi6/blob/f58d8b6cbda22a26ad0886e3d8eae9595e9f5387/lib/App/Mi6.rakumod#L10

[14:37] <leont> Apparently it's File::Temp related. I load it in the test and in a test helper module; if I remove it from the former the crash disappears
[14:49] <leont> The problem disappeared entirely when I removed t/lib/.precomp
[14:55] <tbrowder__> .tell hythm thanks! i’ll try that

[20:52] <Xliff> ?
[20:52] <Xliff> .tell vrurg Thanks!
[20:52] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to vrurg

[21:17] <Xliff> vrurg: Now all I need is to learn how to get C++ classes working in NativeCall. Have any ideas?
[21:18] <vrurg> Xliff: none. I barely an expect in NativeCall. All I remember is that there is special name mangling taking place for C++ method names. :)
[21:20] <Xliff> vrurg: Same here. Thanks anyways.
[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> vrurg: i've had some limited success with NativeCall & Rust where I make a raku proxy for a Rust object and containerize it

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry I have no idea if this is useful for C++ or for your neds
[21:21] <vrurg> librasteve: it's more to Xliff. I hope I wouldn't need to do NativeCall any time soon... :)
