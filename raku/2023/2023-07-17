[08:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for all the reply - while I did use spurt well enough - I also would like to know how to make plan A work in future... here's where I got to...

[08:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> shell <echo “xx” >> file.txt>

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^^ gives an error

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Missing required term after infix at /Users/xxx/test.raku:8 ------> <BOL>⏏<EOL>     expecting any of:         prefix         term

[08:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> which I gather is due to the >> that prematurely closes the <>

[08:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this works...

[08:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> shell ('echo', “xx”, '>>', 'file.txt')

[08:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and so does this

[08:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> shell <echo xx \>\> file.txt>

[08:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so using shell instead of run was my first mistake! thanks!!

[08:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> for my nefarious purposes I wanted to interpolate $x instead of xx and this only works with the old style argument passing of course

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so, after some messing around I got qqx to work too like this...

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my $x = 'yo'; my $cmd = "echo $x >> file.txt"; qqx`$cmd`;

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> where I like to use backticks (`) as the delimiters for old times' sake

[08:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for all the thoughts!!

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hm, using shell instead of run was the right choice though, wasn't it

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's just they take arguments differently, in addition to functioning differently

[10:36] <guifa> SmokeMachine I don't think it's ever been able to handle sub EXPORT, that requires actually running the code and I think it's trying to figure out export functions from a static analysis 

[10:37] *** pony left
[11:04] <SmokeMachine> guifa: that makes sense... :( thanks

[11:08] <SmokeMachine> does anyone see a way to avoid `no precompilation` here (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/examples/test1/Test1Config.rakumod#L2)? I tried some different stiff, but in all, when I try to use the exported functions it can't use the `$obj` (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/lib/Configuration.rakumod#L92) created when I called `generate-exports` here

[13:39] <tbrowder__> SmokeMachine: i suggest, at least for debugging, create an exportable sub with the debugging data. not pretty, but it saves some angst.

[13:47] <tbrowder__> i need a macos person to please translate this line from a githb workflows test yml for linux into one for macos (similarly for windows would also be appreciated):

[13:49] <tbrowder__> sudo apt-get install -y fontforge python3-fontforge ttf2ufm

[13:49] <tbrowder__> thanks

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> i dont know how to express that for macos or windows, but all it's doing is installing the applications listed after -y

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> where -y automatically says 'yes' to any prompts

[13:50] <tbrowder__> yes

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> windows doesn't have a standard package manager though, so im not sure if you'll be able to get a good command to match that

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <su.shi> it has some but you gotta install them and I've honestly never met anyone who uses them

[14:03] <SmokeMachine> tbrowder__: sorry, I didn’t get it… what do you mean?

[14:30] <lizmat> nemokosch more seriously: I read the posts and comments and try to find a tagline for it

[14:36] <tbrowder__> SmokeMachine: i may not understand your need, but i've done this for debugging: in the class definition file, add an exportable subroutine whose output will be a data structure of values you are interested in seeing for debugging. or add a debugging class method to do the same thing.

[16:42] <jdv> is there a ctags generator for raku yet?

[16:48] <SmokeMachine> tbrowder_: my problem there is that if I don’t use `no precompile` when I create the $obj calling `generate-exports` from Test1Config.rakumod and try to use it from 2 different files, it does not exist in at least one of them…

[16:49] <SmokeMachine> (Sorry for the delay… I’m both trying to find the solution for that (with out a computer) and late going to the airport…)

[17:14] <tbrowder__> ok, i have never used "no precompile" but, at least in my setups, i have not had such a problem. when i am working on a new module, i am now in the habit of creating the new repo with mi6-helper. then i create a "dev" directory at the top level. in that directory i often build individual scripts that test something i want to put in the module.  as pieces are workiing, i move them to the appropriate module and add "use lib 

[17:14] <tbrowder__> <../lib>; use MyNew

[17:15] <tbrowder__> Module". i can do that with multiple files and generally have no problems.

[18:04] <tbrowder__> those lines apparently include the contents of the second required  linux pkg: python3-fontforge

[18:05] <tbrowder__> i found the required information by going to rakudo.org and lookingb

[18:08] <tbrowder__> looking the the info for Mac and Windows (found 'brew' and 'choco'), followed the subtle links to Choclately and Homebrew where one can search for packages. at each i found "fontforge" alone, both of which worked in the yml file.

[18:11] <tbrowder__> i searched for one more package i wanted but couldn't find it. both sites have provisions for submitted packages, so it would be nice to have a Raku goto  person who would take package build requests for those two OS's
