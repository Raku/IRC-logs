[11:23] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/08/21/2023-34-september-exercism/
[11:24] <tbrowder__> .seen nxadm
[11:24] <tellable6> tbrowder__, I haven't seen nxadm around, did you mean nadim?
[11:25] <lizmat> you probably mean El_Che 
[11:25] <tbrowder__> yes, thanks
[11:27] <tbrowder__> El_Che: why does rakudo-pkg have the embedded zef directory? it seems to conflict with using zef with the root user, at least for me.
[11:48] <tbrowder__> let me start over: in the rakudo-pkg installation, how can the root  user use zef without its installed modules being used by normal users (including myself when i am not acting as root). is it all done via proper path settings? does a normal user really need a path below /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/raku? can i just create a symlink from /rakudo-pkg/bin/raku to /usr/local/bin for normal users?

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I would like my Physics::Unit module to pick up the locale from the machine to choose the units as us-gallons or imp-gallons - is there a handy way to get the "USAness" of the machine? eg. to inspect the keyboard config?
[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ideally OS neutral, of course

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^^ the wildcard intended to mean I will not care about this part
[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> should I propose this as a new rakudo feature?

[13:37] <Xliff> WTF?
[13:37] <Xliff> I'm getting this when running one of my rakudo scripts:
[13:37] <Xliff> Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 4
[13:37] <Xliff> no space left on device
[13:37] <Xliff> However my drives have plenty of space. Any ideas as to how to best debug this?
[13:44] <Xliff> Turns out the problem was NOT drive space, but open apps.
[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Linux or Windows?

[20:33] <El_Che> tbrowder__: it would be a good idea to agree and document how modules work. It can be confusing with the compiled in path en path sets by users or assumed by zef (eg home)
[20:36] <tbrowder__> yes, i agree. i’m working on something like that in general that to have debian sudo/shell expert critique it.
[20:36] <tbrowder__> *in general like that

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine "RakuCron" is probably the "right" solution for my main Literate programming workflow. Does "RakuCron" allow specification to run a process when, say, a certain file changes?

[23:19] <tbrowder__> *the way it's supposed to be. i think the major problem i'm having is first figuring out how root is supposed to use zef and how to access it. particularly with the rakudo-pkg file layout (my preferred way to maintain system raku).
