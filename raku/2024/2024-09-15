[00:07] <Xliff> I don't know why I'm getting this error, and it looks to be pre-parse.

[00:07] <Xliff> It only happens on some of my modules, but the backtrace makes it difficult to determine if it's a local error or something else?

[00:07] <Xliff> This even occurs in a file that's been completely commented out. 

[00:09] *** librasteve_ left
[00:09] <Xliff> *snarl*

[00:10] <Xliff> The above occurs because there is a symlink in one of the module directories.

[00:10] <Xliff> So for module "A::B::C::D", B is a symlink and the error is triggered. Help!

[00:18] <timo> i can always recommend rr :)

[00:18] <timo> does the RMD env var help? RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG or something?

[00:24] <Xliff> rr?

[00:25] <timo> yeah mozilla rr, it's a record and replay tool

[00:25] <Xliff> timo: Well, root cause is now known.

[00:25] <timo> time traveling debugger

[00:25] <timo> absolute frickin magic

[00:25] <Xliff> Huh! I'll have to look into that.

[01:03] <Xliff> Wonder if I can get Unreal Engine linked to Raku via NativeCall?

[01:03] <Xliff> UE5 -> Custom library wrapping C++ classes to a C interface -> NativeCall -> Raku ?

[02:44] <Xliff> Does anyone know of a good reged to extract all of the "public:" sections from a C++ class?

[02:45] <Xliff> I've come up with this:  m:g/("public:" ).+?<?before \w+":">/' -- but you still have to run another regex to extract any trailing "public:" sections if they are at the end of the class def.

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @abs5tract I was able to build comma-plugin after refreshing the repository and installing Java version 21.

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I.e. without errors.)

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I cannot find where the actual built artifact is. (Steve's location is good hint, but I do not see a "distribution" directory at all.)

[12:01] *** Sgeo left
[12:14] <ab5tract> antononcube: It appears that using `Tasks > build > build` will generate the distribution zip

[12:16] <ab5tract> antononcube: you asked about jdk 22 yesterday. did you have to install jdk 21 separately? because that would be weird

[12:16] <leont> Xliff: clang has an AST output format that could probably be abused.

[13:34] <ab5tract> good news! it looks like we don't actually need `jetbrainsRuntime`, so the building the comma plugin should not require any platform specific setup

[16:28] <ab5tract> and even better: I've got the GitHub Action working for pressing releases. not all the way to publishing via jetbrains marketplace but it's a start! https://github.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin/releases/tag/v2.0-beta.1

[16:35] <ab5tract> huh, that seems really broken somehow

[16:35] <ab5tract> deleted for now, will revisit later

[17:17] <ab5tract> false alarm, it seems to be totally fine.

[19:17] *** euandreh left
[19:38] <ab5tract> antononcube: sorry, I don't get it

[19:41] <ab5tract> would you mind explaining what you mean?

[19:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Your latest posts about the comma plugin GitHub actions working, then not working, then working nevertheless, are nail biting to read through. (Some readers might even have emotional distress…)

[19:42] <ab5tract> I still don't get it. Maybe you forgot to append a `/s`? 

[19:44] <ab5tract> Or else you're just telling me in a sideways manner to shut up, which I also don't really understand

[19:46] <ab5tract> it looked for a second like the plugin that the Action built was installing an entirely different plugin. I didn't want anyone to download that, so I deleted it. I didn't want anyone to wonder why the link didn't have a usable plugin to download, so I announced it

[19:52] *** MoC left

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Ok, next time I will add an /s for you. Or maybe a /5 ?

[20:40] <ab5tract> Why the sarcasm in the first place though?

[20:41] <ab5tract> You’ve asked me questions about building. I answer. You don’t respond, one way or another.

[20:41] <ab5tract> I announce that building isn’t necessary to use the plugin, retract it out if safety concerns, and then announce that it’s possible. You respond with sarcasm

[20:42] <ab5tract> That’s probably 30-40 hours of work in that pipeline output

[20:43] <ab5tract> Sorry that I don’t get it, I expect you were probably just trying to have some lighthearted fun. But it came off as trivializing my efforts and my attempts to share the successes to me

[20:48] <patrickb> ab5tract: I for one am very impressed by what you managed to achieve. A big ++ from me!

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> <ab5tract> "Why the sarcasm in the first place though?" -- Well it was not sarcasm, it was exageration. (You wanted see \s for some reason...)

[21:10] <ab5tract> patrickb: cheers! and thank you for the kind words

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract So, here is what I have after I followed the instructions in the README. So, finally I can find the "distributions" sub-directory in the directory "build". (And comma plugin there.)

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1284986658076364840/comma-plugin-build.png?ex=66e8a095&is=66e74f15&hm=305b0a3bc624f1f6ba56b088c5d16ac23271a84973a8b822d25445170017eddd&

[21:20] <ab5tract> Glad to hear it’s becoming statistically repeatable

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But...  1) It turned out just updating you repository is not sufficient -- it has to be complete removed. First from IntelliJ's project then from disk. 2) The first build(s) following line 2 of the README produced some warnings. 3) Next build(s) did not produce warnings / errors. I was able to find the directory "distributions".

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, "distributions" appeared in step 2 -- too lazy to check now. (I did the full set of steps a few times already.)

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Step 1 was crucial -- I followed these directions: https://stackoverflow.com/a/76318621/14163984

[21:23] <ab5tract> Yeah, I should have announced that you would need to nuke the repo

[21:24] <ab5tract> As I did antisocial some force pushing

[21:25] <ab5tract> Though it sounds more like you were encountering cache issues, which is a different story (I can safely say “not my fault” there)

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is ok. Knowing it can be successfully done -- by librasteve or GitHub actions -- definitely helps.

[21:26] <ab5tract> I don’t know what you mean by “first from IntelliJ’s project though”. Deleting and recloning should have been sufficient

[21:27] <ab5tract> *prpject” though

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, it is not. I checked that -- I deleted the directory first, then opened "Projects" window of IntelliJ, then the directory reappeared.

[21:41] <ab5tract> That sounds quite out of the ordinary. Anyway, now that the releases are generated properly, I’ll stop force pushing on main. That should alleviate the need for this in the future

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I installed the plugin (from disk.) But after opening of a Raku project nothing happened -- for the last 15+ min I see "Updating indexes".

[21:53] <ab5tract> If you have time, doing the same thing in a sandbox via ‘runIde’ would hopefully give usable stack traces for a bug report

[21:54] <ab5tract> (stacktraces would appear in the parent intellij)

[21:54] <ab5tract> Also, I don’t know what happens if you try to open a directory that already contains a Comma project

[21:59] <ab5tract> antononcube: it might also be worth trying “new from sources” instead of “open”

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I wonder is it because the projects I tried have been opened in a previous Comma version.

[22:02] <ab5tract> that sounds very likely

[22:03] <ab5tract> try nuking the `.idea` folder in those projects

[22:04] *** sena_kun left
[22:05] <ab5tract> I've never used Comma as a plugin before, to be honest, only standalone

[22:05] <ab5tract> So I'm not as familiar with how that works

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Trying it now -- it stuck on "Loading indexes". (Instead of "Updating indexes".)

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting! I can create a new Raku project with the plugin, but after closing IntelliJ I cannot open that project.

[22:17] <ab5tract> that's weird

[22:18] <ab5tract> if you can reproduce in `runIde`, the stacktraces would help in fixing the issue

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Will try that tomorrow.

[22:19] <ab5tract> annoyingly, though, things seem to be working via `runIde` that are not when the plugin is loaded into a regular IDE instance

[22:19] <ab5tract> antononcube: thanks

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Are you using IntelliJ community edition or the professional one?

[22:20] <ab5tract> I'm on Ultimate at the moment, but it shouldn't matter

[22:23] <ab5tract> oh, ok, this might be a big contributing factor: it looks like the IDE needs to be restarted after plugin install

[22:45] <ab5tract> restarts now required as of current `HEAD` / release `2.0-beta.3`
