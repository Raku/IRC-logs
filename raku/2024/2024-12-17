[00:00] <timo1> i wonder how similar the design and implementation is to what we last saw on 6guts, or probably the presentation(s?) about it

[00:00] <Xliff> Don't know. Not on 6guts. Is there a link?

[00:00] <timo1> 6guts.wordpress.com iirc

[00:00] <Xliff> Thanks.

[00:00] <timo1> well worth a read. you'd likely have seen links to it in the weekly posts as well

[00:01] <timo1> not very high volume, but definitely high quality

[00:03] <Xliff> Yeah. I can see that. 

[00:03] <Xliff> .seen jnthn

[00:04] <Xliff> timo1: Hope jnthn is doing OK. Have you heard from him, recently?

[00:08] <timo1> haven't talked to him much, but i've exchanged a few words with him about the comma plugin work. that was only two or three months ago i think?

[04:02] <guifa> ab5tract is there a reason that revision gating uses strings instead of v-strings?  (I'm guessing it's too early for v-strings?)

[04:49] <guifa> hmmm I seem to be getting errors using :broadcast on UDP sockets s

[04:50] <guifa> m: my $out = IO::Socket::Async.udp(:broadcast)

[04:50] <guifa> that.... feels not correct

[04:50] <guifa> Docs have `method udp(IO::Socket::Async:U: :$broadcast --> IO::Socket::Async)` with the description `Returns an initialized IO::Socket::Async client object that is configured to send UDP messages using print-to or write-to. The :broadcast adverb will set the SO_BROADCAST option which will allow the socket to send packets to a broadcast address.`

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Turns out copy-&-pasting Markdown with LaTeX formulas into WordPress gets rid of the LaTeX code. (Big surprise, I know‚Ä¶)

[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, I had to ‚Äúurgently‚Äù fix that in the latest Raku Advent post. üôÇ

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> im working on tomorrows post right now btw

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The formulas look sub-optimal, but better than (puzzling) nothing.

[09:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve What is the title? Or it is a secret/surprise.

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised that Raku works so well to do regression fitting with real data. Both computation and plots.

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, the computation was helped by my latest fix my ‚ÄúMath::Matrix‚Äù fork. I have not issued the corresponding PR, because I wanted to do some more fixes or code reviews.

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Happy‚Ñ¢ Xmas

[10:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> got the code working ... nothing like last minute! now to write the text

[11:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube I think the idea of community modules is that any PR needs to be reviewed by another maintainer (eg to prevent malicious code from russian spies) - anyway I am happy to do that role on Math::Matrix when you are ready to PR

[11:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe easier for me to take one feature at a time given my small brain ;-)

[14:02] <[Coke]> Q: is git just faster on non-windows? anyone else see this? (or is just my particular windows box that is slow)

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Using git though a web browser?

[14:04] <timo> i seem to recall something about git being slower on windows, yeah. but that was yeeeaars ago

[14:04] <patrickb> Historically (and I guess to some extent still true today) git has been decidedly slower on Windows than unixoids.

[14:06] <timo> so just use git in a WSL2 VM LOL
