[19:46] <tbrowder> yo, hello

[19:46] <tbrowder> i need help with lizmat's rak, please

[19:48] <tbrowder> i need to search the entire readable file system for files ending in a specific pattern, e.g,, '.otf' or '.ttf', etc.

[19:49] <tbrowder> the files must be readable by ordinary users

[19:50] <tbrowder> i've tried: rak / .otf --type=ends-with

[19:51] <tbrowder> and variants. i can search most any path but /

[19:52] <tbrowder> haha! i haven't tried /usr (not sure if that"

[19:52] <tbrowder> that's valid on a mac

[19:52] <ab5tract> tbrowder: that's really more of a permissions issue than a rak one though, right?

[19:54] <ab5tract> also, for that purpose I would probably go with piping find into grep, but it's really a separate question 

[19:54] <ab5tract> since both will be constrained by the same permissions

[19:55] <tbrowder> yes, i dir get the line to work when i used: '/usr' for the path

[19:56] <tbrowder> but the result was a list of relative file name (with lots of dots)

[19:57] <tbrowder> is /usr a valid path on a mac?

[19:59] <tbrowder> i have tried find on a mac (until it got lent to my grandson) but it was quite different. i am hoping to use rak to mitigate that

[20:03] <tbrowder> hm, there may be a magic $*PATH to do that...back to the docs...

[20:09] <ab5tract> ‘/usr’ will not be comprehensive, fwiw. That misses ‘/Users’, most significantly

[20:10] <tbrowder> ah, that's on mac, right?

[20:13] <tbrowder> .ask lizmat is there any way to get 'rak' to search for all files readable by the user on linux and macos and windows using the same syntax?

[20:13] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[20:15] <tbrowder> my use case in particular is searching for all installed font files (especially ending in otf, .ttf, and .pfb)

[20:15] <tbrowder> *.otf

[20:54] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:34] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:36] <guifa> You can find fonts in /User but outside of shared folders, you'll only really get them in ~/Library/Fonts

[21:46] <tbrowder> thnx

[22:54] *** sena_kun joined
[23:03] <ab5tract> Yeah I don’t know if it really makes sense to search an entire file system

[23:04] <ab5tract> Linux provides utilities for querying installed fonts

[23:04] <ab5tract> I’m pretty sure macOS does as well. And I’d be surprised if there were nothing available for Windows

[23:39] <lizmat> tbrowder: --is-readable

[23:39] <tellable6> 2024-11-02T20:13:19Z #raku <tbrowder> lizmat is there any way to get 'rak' to search for all files readable by the user on linux and macos and windows using the same syntax?
