[09:02] <SmokeMachine> Hi! Does anyone know if whoever is talking on TPRC (I just sent my talk) should pay for the ticket?

[09:13] <SmokeMachine> What I'm asking is: if my talk is accepted, will I pay for the ticket?

[09:14] *** sena_kun joined
[09:14] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: I have no idea, you should ask the organizers.  Maybe Util knows

[09:16] <SmokeMachine> Util: do you know if the speakers on TPRC pay for their tickets?

[09:16] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thanks

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine This page says: > Accepted Speaker notification. April 15, 2024 https://www.papercall.io/tprclas24

[09:27] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: oh, yes! that says: `All selected speakers (except lightning talks) will receive a free ticket to the event.`

[09:27] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: thanks!

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  for my @a = [1,2,3] -> $ is rw { $++ }; dd @a; Mu @a = [1, 2, 3] 

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this on my local repl (2024.01) ...

[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  for my @a = [1,2,3] -> $a is rw { $a = $++ }; dd @a; Mu @a = [0, 1, 2] 

[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ or this

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> from a coding style pov I would avoid the first since $ is also commonly the anon state variable - so quite hard to get the intent of the code

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  for my @a = [1,2,3] <-> $a { $a++ }; dd @a; Mu @a = [2, 3, 4] 

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> even ^^ this (which I think is safe-ish) I would avoid since re-writing loop iteration values in place in a loop is pretty side effecty (although I can imagine that a BIG data structure could benefit from an in-place modification if you are low on memory (if raku in fact avoids making a copy on the fly anyway which I haven't checked)

[14:01] <Voldenet> > m: for my @a = [1,2,3] -> $_ is rw { $_++ }; dd @a;

[14:01] <Voldenet> I don't get why people would use mutations in such case

[14:02] <Voldenet> my @a = [1,2,3].map(++*); dd @a;

[14:02] <evalable6> Voldenet, rakudo-moar ccf48ad23: OUTPUT: ¬´Mu @a = [2, 3, 4]‚ê§¬ª

[14:02] <Voldenet> no mutations, clear and clean

[14:02] <Voldenet> or even

[14:02] <Voldenet> my @a = [1,2,3].map(1+*); dd @a;

[14:02] <evalable6> Voldenet, rakudo-moar ccf48ad23: OUTPUT: ¬´Mu @a = [2, 3, 4]‚ê§¬ª

[14:03] <Voldenet> it's very likely slower, but if I wanted speed, I'd use C

[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Voldenet: I 99% agree with you ... the only reason I can imagine is that you want to traverse a very large data structure and to update the elements "in place" to avoid eg a memory overflow ... in which case, as you mention, you should be coding in C

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry if I did not make it clear that my examples are intended to be "what not to do"

[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the first one proves the point since the result is different on the IRC codebot than in my local repo

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> (it's different because on the IRC side $_ is used and used twice, and when verbatim reflected here, since text between underscores are italized, it looks like they used $)

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there was a proposal to do post processing on IRC messages if they start with "m:" such that what follows is wrapped around backticks to better see what's going on

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine apologies for dropping off the face of the earth for a week, I didn't have time to look at the github issue becasue I was focused on interviews, but I finally got a job

[17:31] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: no problem at all! And congratulations!

[17:31] <SmokeMachine> I hope you like this job!

[17:32] *** dakkar left
[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine Yeah I hope it's gonna be good haha

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> !congratulations

[17:55] <[Coke]> looking at https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/live.html, searching for aruniecrisps because I missed the send about the job (congrats!), and the send from smokemachine "I hope you like this job!" appears, but with no nick next to it.

[17:56] <[Coke]> looking at the source, I'm thinking it's hiding his name because he said something BEFORE that, but the filter isn't showing it, but isn't then revealing his name.

[17:56] <[Coke]> There is a <td nick="SmokeMachine">, e.g.

[18:39] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I haven‚Äôt done much last week (I was travelling for work). But I‚Äôve done a bit‚Ä¶

[18:41] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: just today I‚Äôve submitted a talk proposal to TPRC to talk about Red migration‚Ä¶ so, I NEED to make that work‚Ä¶ :)

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine I find "Red" to be too much a corporate name.

[18:48] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, what do you mean?

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Didn't you name "Red" after Oracle?

[18:51] <SmokeMachine> No‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even name what the relation would be

[18:52] <SmokeMachine> Raku Embraces Databases

[18:52] <SmokeMachine> (Ok, when Red started, Raku was still called Perl6)

[18:54] <SmokeMachine> The name came because a friend raked me if I wanted to help him to write an ORM that would be called Blue‚Ä¶ but he didn‚Äôt have time to work on that and I thought Blue too sad‚Ä¶ then I called it Red

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine See the section "Other uses" here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Red

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Amazon's "Redshift" is named after Oracle. (I.e. hinting at replacing Oracle products.)

[19:06] <SmokeMachine> Not related to it‚Ä¶ I like to think it means Raku Embraces Databases

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Aha, and apparently Oracle too...

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Anyway, I was not aware of the "Raku Embraces Databases" interpretation.
