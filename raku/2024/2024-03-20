[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Is there a doc page for <->? This is the first I‚Äôve seen that syntax

[17:30] *** vlad joined
[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> @roguerakudev Turns out that if you search for exactly that at docs.raku.org, you will find this: https://docs.raku.org/routine/infix%3A%26lt%3B-%26gt%3B

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there's this https://docs.raku.org/type/Block if it counts

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> mentions in the middle

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> @Rog : @Nahita is correct, I pointed to a different <->.

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - infix:<-> (subtraction operator) is the only thing that the index shows ... it's the class Block <-> signature introducer as @nahita3882 mentioned ...

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4438 << I have made a doc issue
