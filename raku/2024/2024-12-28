[11:08] <SmokeMachine> Have any one ever seen an error saying `lang-call cannot invoke object of type 'VMNull' belonging to no language at line`? I'm getting it on a module I'm playing with and I'm not being able to fix... Would someone be kind enough to help me with that? The details are on this PR: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/pull/9

[12:26] *** Sgeo left
[12:52] <guifa> I have gotten it once or twice, I think when dealing with slangs?

[12:57] <SmokeMachine> In my case it seems to be related to Cro template compilation...

[13:03] <SmokeMachine> That's odd... I printed the AST to be compiled when the compilation fails and when that succeeds... exactly same ast...

[13:05] <SmokeMachine> no... not exactly the same... the prelude seems to be different!!!

[13:06] <SmokeMachine> no... it seems to be just a different order...

[16:36] <Xliff> \o - Happy post Christmas!

[16:36] <Xliff> Who is maintaining the Cairo bindings, now? It was timo's

[16:42] <lizmat> if timo isn't interested in that anymore, we could move it to raku community modules

[16:43] <Xliff> Looks like dwarring is the one making the most recent commits. Last one was 6 months ago, which is recent enough.

[16:43] <Xliff> .seen dwarring

[16:44] <Xliff> O_o

[16:44] <Xliff> Is there no more bot?

[16:44] <lizmat> looks indeed like we lost tellable6

[16:46] <Xliff> Looks like we lost all of the -ables

[16:46] <lizmat> :-(

[16:47] <Xliff> Is there a repo for bisectable?

[16:50] <lizmat> bisectable6: help

[16:50] <bisectable6> lizmat, Like this: bisectable6: old=2015.12 new=HEAD exit 1 if (^∞).grep({ last })[5] // 0 == 4 # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/wiki/Bisectable

[16:51] <Xliff> Oh! 

[16:51] <Xliff> Well that's a relief.

[16:51] <Xliff> OK. I just cried wolf. I see them now. Except tellable

[18:25] <Xliff> 1,214,860 lines of Raku.

[18:56] <[Coke]> ah, I wonder if the ping commit actually did something

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> .seen Xliff

[18:56] <tellable6> antononcube, I saw Xliff 2024-12-28T18:55:56Z in #raku: <Xliff> s/doctor/shrink/ ?

[18:56] <timo> well, therapists and psychiatrists are both kinds of medical doctor

[18:56] <timo> ... i think?

[18:56] <Xliff> timo: I'm now working on GOffice and Gnumeric to see if I can get a proper spreadsheet widget out of it.

[18:57] <timo> neat

[18:57] <timo> i wonder how libreoffice can be interfaced with

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If libreoffice can be compiled with ZeroMQ libraries, then it can be made to use Raku. (Or any other language.)

[19:02] <Xliff> Why do you need to use the ZeroMQ libs/

[19:03] <timo> yeah, the tech used to send messages back and forth is not as important. what kinds of things you can access at all is the bit i'm interested in

[19:04] <timo> there's support for python scripting, that much i know, but beyond that no clue

[19:18] <Xliff> timo: Hmmm... I'll look into that.

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Because inter-language / inter-system connections via ZeroMQ are very well established or understood.

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again, if ZeroMQ connect is figured out for one language, then other languages can be used.

[19:20] <Xliff> antoncube: That's true, but am hoping I don't have to add more pieces to it and can just use NativeCall;

[19:22] <timo> i think you probably mean the ipython kernel protocol, rather than zmq in general?

[19:26] <Xliff> Ah. It's C++. That's always a crapshoot in NativeCall

[19:52] *** Aedil left
[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo If your last comment was for me -- no, I am thinking direct application of ZMQ. I am not that familiar with IPython kernel. (And mostly do not care.)

[20:22] <Xliff> antononcube: So you would use ZMQ messages to execute libreoffice functions?

[20:22] <Xliff> Are those documented anywhere?

[21:28] <patrickb> In a META6.json dependency specification, is it possible, to require at least version 0.8.9.5 and also forbid versions with a different major version number?

[21:32] <ugexe> patrickb: you can use api as the "major" version part

[21:33] <patrickb> That's a good idea. Thanks!

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I was said if ZMQ can be compiled with libreoffice . After some searching it does not seem to be the case.

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> At least, not easily.

[22:52] *** guifa joined
[23:03] <Xliff> antononcube: Yah. That was my take, too. :(

[23:12] <guifa> I wish AppleScript were more supported than it is nowadays

[23:12] <guifa> it was the perfect thing for interapp communication (even if it had a wonky syntax)
