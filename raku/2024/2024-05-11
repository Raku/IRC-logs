[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve More or less I made the macOS GitHub Actions work by copying the libzmq.5.dylib library — see here : https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Jupyter-Chatbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/macos.yml

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube    that's very good - btw I was wondering what the line of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH does and happened on this https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#MacOS_-_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH_is_ignored ... but the copy is what I tested and that works fine - I will go close my Issue with this example so I can find it when I need it

[08:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I saw the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH use in the actions of the package "Marrow" -- see the messages by @_grenzo  above. It did not work for me.

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw LD_LIBRARY_PATH is also ignored (see the linked brian d foy post) ... which leads me to two questions that are above my knowledge level, but surely there are others here that will know: (I) is there a way to "manually" pass additional path such as /opt/homebrew/lib into raku nativecall via a raku specific environment variable (so that I do not have to cp all my brew installed dynlib around) [yes, I have read

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> the doc, but can't find this] and if not (II) would it be a sensible feature request to raise in rakudo/rakudo since there are many of us that use homebrew on the mac.

[12:26] <ugexe> Rakudo should not fix homebrew stuff 

[12:27] <ugexe> home brew those libraries in a different location because they are arm - they didn’t want to mix arm and non arm libraries in the same location 

[12:29] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/805659d347c5d08a07762b4aad4e1128

[12:31] <ugexe> Thats a workaround I used for a python library, as any language will have the same issue (since again it’s an environment issue not a language issue)

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ugexe: OK - I agree that raku should not fix brew or other environment issues - imo the macOS folks have often messed with the dev experience and I do more and more in pure ubuntu (often via vftools which is a very fast and lean VM for macOS) ... thanks for your guidance!
