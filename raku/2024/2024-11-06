[12:53] <lizmat> technically I wouldn't have an issue with that...

[12:53] <lizmat> but I'm a bit reluctant to be passing mail around the world...  

[12:54] <Xliff> Ah. No worries, then. Still...nice domain! ;)

[12:54] *** abraxxa-home joined
[12:54] <lizmat> it is  :-)

[12:55] <lizmat> lemme think about it some more...

[12:56] <Xliff> OK

[13:11] <lizmat> Xliff: I'm slightly worried that you wouldn't be able to send email with that email address using your own mail server

[14:20] <patrickb> ab5tract: I'm wondering: Terminal-Print is only using a hand full of VT commands. My impression is that in today's time terminals are pretty much standardized. Could we just hard code the VT sequences for those few commands? That would rid us of our dependency on tput, curses and termcap/terminfo.

[14:22] <ab5tract> Yes, this is what I was saying about Terminal::ANSI

[14:22] <ab5tract> Though there should not be any dependency on curses as is

[14:22] <ab5tract> As that library is not re-entrant I avoided it

[14:25] <ab5tract> I sort of recall there being some issues when not using tput to generate the sequences, but maybe  I did it that way out of general compatibility concerns

[14:29] <patrickb> The top most thing on my to-do list now is to get all of the terminal stack of Raku working on Windows.

[14:30] <patrickb> If it's fine by you I'll try to go down the route of hard coded sequences.

[14:31] <ab5tract> Also, this looks pretty awesome https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb If you can figure out how to configure properly GitHub Windows workflows I will be very interested.

[15:08] <patrickb> ab5tract: I mentioned curses, because tput is typically provided by the curses package.

[15:09] <patrickb> ab5tract: Are you ok with me trying my hand on raw VT sequences in T-P?

[15:09] <ab5tract> huh, I would have expected it to be part of core-utils but 

[15:10] <patrickb> Maybe I misremember...

[15:10] <ab5tract> patrickb: sure, I have no issues with that

[15:11] <patrickb> Cool!

[15:11] <ab5tract> though I stll think the right place to address this is in an NQP module that would ship with core

[15:11] <ab5tract> but let's see how it turns out in T::P

[15:12] <patrickb> What is "this" you are referring to? A small VT sequence DB?

[15:12] <ab5tract> exactly

[17:57] <coleman> it's not widespread but as a kitty user I'm obligated to mention the kitty terminal protocol which occasionally causes me problems over ssh https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/protocol-extensions/

[17:58] <coleman> I don't know the exact escape code conflicts to be honest 

[17:59] <coleman> on Linux most distributions provide a kitty-terminfo package 

[17:59] <coleman> on OpenBSD I open a gnome terminal if I want to use vi :) 

[18:00] <coleman> (logging into an OpenBSD server from a Linux desktop, that is)

[19:43] <ab5tract> I have the impression that SSH has issues with escape codes in general

[19:45] <timo> ssh just transmits the escape codes back and forth mostly transparently, but if the terminal you are using locally is not known to the other side, or the terminfo on the remote side is maybe out of date, or you are setting the wrong TERM on the remote side (it's one of the env vars that ssh is supposed to transmit by default i think?) then you'll run into trouble

[19:46] <timo> what's the solution? maybe something that transmit the correct terminfo form your local machine to the remote for programs to use? sounds terrible tbh :D

[19:47] <timo> a completely new protocol that does away with the legacy cruft? :D

[20:28] <ab5tract> librasteve_ / librasteve: are you still experiencing this issues? https://github.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin/issues/15

[20:28] <ab5tract> *issue

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I have experienced a few comma-2.0 plugin issues today. Hanging again maybe 2-3 times. I will try to recreate the "click path" soon.

[20:45] <ab5tract> Which beta are you running?

[20:45] <ab5tract> But also, is the linked issue fixed?

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good question -- I think 23 or 34.

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am trying to find out.

[20:46] <ab5tract> Gotcha, well maybe the latest fixes the problem

[20:46] <ab5tract> also, apologies because I didn’t read carefully and thought you were librasteve for a second

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ok. The hang was produced with very contrived path of editing script configurations.

[20:58] <ab5tract> antononcube: I don't think there's much I can do about contrived input unless it's more clearly described :)

[21:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I have to make  movie.

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If I can reproduce with comma-2.0 r26.

[21:08] <ab5tract> gotcha

[21:42] <ab5tract> patrickb: what's an SGR? :)

[21:45] <patrickb> Select Graphic Rendition. Those are ANSI escape codes starting with \e[ and ending with m. Those codes set the style (color, italic, blinking, ...)

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (in reply to ab5tract "are you still experiencing..."

[21:46] *** orangebot left
[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am using the comma plugin I built from latest beta on 17Oct (not sure where to look for the beta version in the src)

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> guess I need to rebuild - will do that and revert on the open issue tomorrow

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> &afk

[22:07] <ab5tract> librasteve: the beta version has an associated tag, so it would be the latest tag present in the repo checkout

[22:31] <guifa> has anyone poked the author of Terminal::ANSI to move to zef?

[23:20] <ab5tract> patrickb: you asked earlier about whether switching to a static DB of escape sequences makes sense

[23:21] <ab5tract> This led me to wonder why it wasn’t based off of Terminal::ANSI already

[23:21] <ab5tract> It turns out that it’s really just an age thing

[23:21] <ab5tract> So to be clear: it makes a lot of sense to me
