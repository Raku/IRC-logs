[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there a "quick way" to classify a string as Raku expression?  Of course, I can use some of the Raku grammar packages (e.g. "Perl6::Parser") or make my own classifier, but maybe something like that is already built in.

[17:05] <lizmat> ?try $string.EVAL

[17:06] <lizmat> ?try $string.EVAL(:check)

[17:06] <lizmat> actually  :-)

[17:09] <lizmat> hmmmm

[17:09] <lizmat> m: say ?try "say 42".EVAL(:check) =:= Nil

[17:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar c456ba18b: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:09] <lizmat> m: say ?try "say 42+".EVAL(:check) =:= Nil

[17:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar c456ba18b: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[17:10] <lizmat> m: sub is-raku-expression($code) { ?try $code.EVAL(:check) =:= Nil }; say is-raku-expression "42"

[17:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar c456ba18b: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:10] <lizmat> m: sub is-raku-expression($code) { ?try $code.EVAL(:check) =:= Nil }; say is-raku-expression "42+"

[17:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar c456ba18b: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[17:10] <lizmat> m: sub is-raku-expression($code) { ?try $code.EVAL(:check) =:= Nil }; say is-raku-expression "42+666"

[17:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar c456ba18b: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:11] <lizmat> antononcube ^^

[17:11] <lizmat> note that this *WILL* execute any BEGIN blocks in the code

[17:12] <lizmat> implicit (e.g. "use foo") or explicit (BEGIN run "naughtycode")
