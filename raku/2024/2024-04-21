[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5tract: awesome job ... very tricky and your explanation is clear and illustrates how these corner cases were not caught in over 6 years

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> have you checked if there are other, similar conditions that could arise eg. is memcmp sometimes given 64-bit byte strings (this is just a guess ... but I think that we would like to be confident that similar, but different regex patterns are not going to trip over a closely related mechanism

[17:02] <coleman> ugexe: I agree. I kind of wish I'd pushed back against it more when it went in. Some people really like the shortcuts, but I think we can give them what they want, just not by default. My comments here: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/344#issuecomment-2068134677

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> amen to this ... To be honest, I don't think we should take over any key combos at all.

[17:05] <coleman> GitHub does it in SOME UI views, like interactive code editors. They do it well. They also have billions of dollars and thousands of JavaScript devs lol

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [don't mean to dump on innovation ... but in general you need to cover a LOT of corner cases for overrides like this to avoid user frustration ... eg iPads, touch in general, etc and on every browser / OS combo .... its doable for github with their deep pockets and resources ... btw they capture the '/' key for search and not the ctrl-f]

[17:10] <coleman> they use '/' in most views, yea. And while i never use it, it doesn't get in my way. They take over Ctrl+F here...Another feature I rarely use https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/edit/main/CHANGELOG.md

[17:10] <coleman> (interactive editing)

[17:10] <coleman> But anyway, your point stands.
