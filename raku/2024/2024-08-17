[01:54] <wayland> Hi all!  Just a note that I have made docker-compose work in a github action to run Raku tests.  This means I can run an SQL database for tests.  It's in my Table-Oriented Programming repo at https://github.com/wayland/Raku-TOP .  

[01:54] <tellable6> 2024-08-10T12:50:41Z #raku-dev <lizmat> wayland fixed https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Hash::Ordered?v=0.0.7

[02:05] <wayland> Thanks lizmat++

[10:51] <tbrowder> ? please: i have a parent class A that creates and manages child class objects along with subs. can i define a dynamic var at A's creation that is usable throughout the code during the existence of A?

[10:52] <tbrowder> i mean my own var, not a Raku system-defined standard one.

[10:55] <lizmat> dynamic vars are dynamic: they are looked up in the call stack

[10:55] <lizmat> feels to me that's orthogonal to what you want?

[10:56] <lizmat> couldn't it be an attribute in class A?

[10:57] <lizmat> or: if it is a sentinel, a lexical var in the class accessible through a method ?

[10:57] <tbrowder> something like: class A { submethod TWEAK { our $*A = 1; } }

[11:01] <tbrowder> yes, it could be. i was hoping i could eliminate some routine args by referring to a $*A instead of passing it all over the place.

[11:02] <tbrowder> just being lazy...and currently a fluid design

[11:03] <lizmat> if you need to pass around the same set of args around all the time, maybe you need an object to encapsulate all of those args ?

[11:05] <tbrowder> to be specific, i can use $*HOME fine but i would like to change dir $*HOME/dirA to another value for debugging, say to $*HOME/dirB

[11:08] <tbrowder> yes, you're right, and i've done that, too. just being lazy until the code gels

[11:08] <tbrowder> so, possible though? (even though bad practice)

[11:10] *** dawids left
[11:13] <lizmat> if your code is still fluid, don't optimize for this: premature optimization is the root of all evil  :-)

[11:14] <tbrowder> for sure! Dr. Don is my coding hero! ok, i'll set a good example and not do that...i already pass :$debug to most routines so easy enough to chg subdir path on $*HOME

[11:15] <tbrowder> thnx for feedback

[11:16] <lizmat> yw

[12:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5tract: i replied to this msg from @jaguart2953 here on discord (i guess the irc side of the bridge can’t see that) <jaguart> Did you all watch the Damian on perl multi methods and cleaning up smartmatch?

[12:20] <lizmat> yes, I saw most of it.  I was disappointed in the sense that I hoped that Damian would spend that amount of time on Raku instead

[12:20] <lizmat> the presentation itself must have cost at least 120 hours to make.  Let alone the actual work on the code

[12:36] <lizmat> but, as in any open source project, someone is entirely free to spend the time in the manner that they want

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jaguart   > Did you all watch the Damian on perl multi methods and cleaning up smartmatch? I do not see why would I watch that…

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Put aside your dislike (ahem) of Perl for a bit and watch 10 minutes of Damian's talk starting here, just to see why he's always interesting to listen to, Perl or not: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x9LD8oOmv0&t=2920s

[15:11] <wayland76> Hi!  Can someone tell me whether the first line of output from https://gist.github.com/wayland/5562e6c92c4f16d3c186401fa182639a is a bug?  

[15:27] <lizmat> no, it isn't

[15:28] <lizmat> wayland76: ^^

[15:28] <wayland76> Hmm.  

[15:28] <lizmat> as there is no default for the attribute. but there *is* a type

[15:28] <wayland76> So how should I be setting attributes on my class then?  

[15:28] <lizmat> also: "is built" is superfluous for a $.foo attribute

[15:29] <lizmat> hmmmm  

[15:29] <wayland76> OK, but why isn't "name" set to "IsMyName"?  

[15:29] <lizmat> maybe I should read better

[15:30] <lizmat> aaah.. ok

[15:30] <lizmat> "is SetHash"

[15:31] <lizmat> I guess SetHash overrides .new

[15:32] <wayland76> My guess is that it's "Setty", because in my actual code, I have a "new" function (because I'm debugging), and if I call "nextcallee", it says it's on Setty.  

[15:32] <lizmat> yup

[15:32] <wayland76> ("actual code" as opposed to the demo I gisted)

[15:34] <wayland76> I'm guessing it's working as intended, though it's annoying :p 

[15:35] <lizmat> perhaps this will help:

[15:35] <lizmat>         multi method new(SetHashDescendant: *@_, *%_) {

[15:35] <lizmat>             self.bless(|%_).STORE(@_)

[15:35] <lizmat>         }

[15:40] *** skylendar joined
[15:40] <lizmat> wayland76: actually, it doesn't need to be a multi

[15:40] <lizmat> method new(*@_, *%_) { self.bless(|%_).STORE(@_) }

[15:40] <lizmat> will do as well

[15:40] <wayland76> Thanks!  My original question had a mistake in it -- I left out the actual bug.  I've posted a "version 2" on that gist now, and I think that *does* have a bug in it -- the TWEAK method doesn't get called.  

[15:41] <lizmat> with: method new(*@_, *%_) { self.bless(|%_).STORE(@_) }

[15:41] <lizmat> it will

[15:41] <skylendar> Hi there, I'm trying to install the raku Readline module with zef from linux.

[15:42] <skylendar> I got he latest raku archive, but when I zef install Readline, I only get Aborting due to fetch failure:

[15:42] <wayland76> lizmat: Interesting! Thanks!  

[15:43] <lizmat> the logic for calling BUILD and TWEAK lives inside .bless basically, not .new

[15:43] <wayland76> Oh!  Good to know.  

[15:45] <wayland76> skylendar: Works for me.  That means we're going to have to talk versions.  I'm on Fedora 36 with Rakudo 2022.04.  What versions are you on?  

[15:46] <skylendar> version of raku ? rakudo-moar-2024.07-01-linux-x86_64-gcc

[15:46] <wayland76> What about zef --version ?  

[15:46] <skylendar> 0.22.1

[15:47] <lizmat> that's all pretty recent  :-)

[15:47] <skylendar> I told  you

[15:49] <lizmat> hmmm can't reproduce on the Linux box I have

[15:49] *** bdju left
[15:49] <skylendar> hint: when I try wget https://360.zef.pm/R/EA/READLINE/f62b94759eb525560020a1b71ddd075c25d1af1f.tar.gz

[15:50] <skylendar> wget returns: Impossible to locally verify the 360.zef.p attribute the authority of the emitter

[15:52] <MasterDuke> no errors doing that for me. are you on a vpn or behind a firewall?

[15:52] <skylendar> vpn no. firewall of course yes

[15:53] <lizmat> feels like some local security being applied..   

[15:53] <skylendar> can deactivate the firewall

[15:54] <skylendar> but it doesn't change anything

[15:55] <wayland76> I can do the wget no problems.  

[15:56] <skylendar> There is also an issue with : can't get the attribute from CN=Amazon RSA 2048 M03,O=Amazon,C=US »

[15:57] <skylendar> I'm outsde the US. Doesn it matter ?

[15:58] <lizmat> I'm also outside the US... and no problems

[15:58] <lizmat> tonyo:  ^^ does that ring a bell

[15:58] <lizmat> ?

[15:58] <wayland76> I have a lurking suspicion.  Try wget --secure-protocol=TLSv1_2 https://360.zef.pm/R/EA/READLINE/f62b94759eb525560020a1b71ddd075c25d1af1f.tar.gz

[15:59] <wayland76> (I'm in Australia for the record)

[15:59] <skylendar>  --no-check-certificate No,l wget suggest to do: wget --no-check-certificate

[16:00] <skylendar> tried wget --secure-protocol=TLSv1_2 but got the same answer

[16:01] <MasterDuke> same with curl?

[16:01] <wayland76> OK.  I'm probably out of ideas then.  Except maybe try it in Chromium and see if you get the same error.  

[16:01] <skylendar> same stuff with curl

[16:02] <wayland76> (At work on Friday, CloudFlare had changed something to do with SSL and it took one of our clients' sites offline).  

[16:03] <skylendar> can download the archive with firefox

[16:03] <wayland76> Interesting.  Is Firefox on the same device/OS?  

[16:04] <skylendar> yes

[16:07] <skylendar> tried with lynx. no way

[16:07] <skylendar> I seems to be related to the amazone certif

[16:08] <skylendar> if available or not.

[16:08] <skylendar> in the case of zef, it doesnt seem to be present

[16:14] <wayland76> That sounds reasonable.  And if wget/curl/lynx all share the same cert store, that would explain it.  

[16:15] <skylendar> absolutely

[16:15] *** bdju joined
[16:15] <skylendar> ans this store seems to be outside of zef

[16:19] <skylendar> the gnutls packages don't seem to include such a store

[16:20] <skylendar> but  ca-certificates package maybe yes

[16:27] <skylendar> let's test with ubuntu

[16:33] <skylendar> I could install raku 2022 on ubuntu but it's too old

[16:34] <MasterDuke> i have a ca-certificates package installed on my os (arch linux), do you?

[16:36] <skylendar> yes I do, but it contains certs for various pieces of software

[16:43] <skylendar> ok I was able to  install Readline on ubuntu, but not Linenoise

[16:44] <skylendar> nor /var/lib/ca-certificates/openssl in fact

[16:44] <skylendar> I meant Terminal::Lineeditor

[16:46] <skylendar> ok for Terminal::Lineeditor

[16:47] <skylendar> and ok for Linenoise

[16:47] *** bdju left
[16:57] <skylendar> ok, Ubuntu only offers the mozilla cacert packages, apparently

[17:13] *** bdju joined
[17:15] <skylendar> my distro doesn't seem to include std .crt files

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs For the record, I pretty faithfully practice the principle of "informed hate." I did not watch Damian's talk "The Once and Future Perl - Damian Conway - TPRC 2024", but I generated two different LLM-derived breakdowns and summaries of that talk. (And asked for validations of them here.)

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here are the corresponding links:

[17:44] *** bdju joined
[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Take that @lizmat and @Coke : https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/UpsideDownTextConvert/

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> TBH, that Wolfram Language (WL) function UpsideDownTextConvert  is not as powerful as the corresponding Raku packages.

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I skimmed those summaries and they're quite interesting, but they do no justice to what I'd hope you see in those 10 minutes I pointed to. In particular, his explaining the multi-dispatch disambiguation mechanism in as "simple as ABC" a way as possible should at least bring a smile to your face 🙂

[22:45] <tonyo> skylendar: can you curl the same endpoint?  zef uses curl or wget under the hood.  you can also try enabling only the wget fetcher in zef

[22:45] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to skylendar

[22:46] <tonyo> a `-v` dump would also be helpful
