[12:00] <tbrowder> any mac user use the #mac irc?

[12:02] <tbrowder> i need help installing the freetype library for a module project

[13:04] <ab5tract> tbrowder: try using se brew + lizmat’s module that fixes the library loading permissions

[15:14] <lizmat> tbrowder: https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/MacOS::NativeLib to be precise

[15:27] <jdv> randomly had an old friend say "the reason i dont use that lang is the logo"

[15:27] <jdv> i didnt know it was a thing

[15:28] <jdv> some people will always find something tgey dont like and latch on:(

[15:36] <lizmat> feels to me such people have more general issues as well, if the logo is so important to them

[15:37] <jdv> my general feel as well.  its just a logo:)

[15:42] <lizmat> it's not like we require to have it tattooed on your forehead  :-)

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Wait, the tattoo WASN'T required?  Well, now I just feel foolish.

[16:06] <lizmat> :-)
