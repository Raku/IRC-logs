[01:34] <tbrowder> tonyo1: i'm looking for a suitable raku script that uses Inline::Python to test it. the module passes now on my debian box, but it would be nice to have a "real word" prog if possible.

[01:36] <tbrowder> the module has several outstanding issues going back several years, so it would be nice to close them.

[13:52] <[Coke]> lost my IRC settings, what's "don't auto scroll"

[13:52] <[Coke]> (irssI)

[13:54] <sjn> something related to the scrollback command?

[13:55] <sjn>  /help scrollback

[13:56] * sjn uses irssi, but doesn't understand what [Coke] is talking about

[13:58] <sjn> the only place where "scroll" is mentioned in his .irssi/config is where it mentions "scrollback"

[14:03] <[Coke]> when on window 2, I want window 3 to not automatically scroll up - I want it to not lose any sends so I don't have to scroll up when I switch to that window.

[14:04] <[Coke]> ... but I figured out what's going on with my always-on irc box, once I fix it, everything will be fine.

[14:05] *** xinming left
[14:06] <[Coke]> guessing it's settings = { fe-text = { ... scroll = "no" }} but I have no idea. it's 20 years of stuff I've saved in there. :)

[14:42] * Guest5605 wonders how long until my nick frees up from my other login.

[14:44] <Guest5605> lovely mac issue where once every year or so, the external drive that's mounted as /Volumes/FOO gets remounted as "/Volumes/FOO 1" which then causes a new user home dir to be created on /Volumes/FOO which is now just a regular directory.

[14:44] <Guest5605> just long enough for me to forget what happened the last time.

[15:43] <[Coke]_> "You are now identified for [Coke]", but:

[15:45] <timo> GHOST           Reclaims use of a nickname.

[15:45] *** [Coke] is now known as Guest1428

[15:45] <timo> GHOST <nick> [password] (if you're logged in already, no need to specify the password)

[15:45] <timo> there you go

[15:46] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[15:47] <[Coke]> https://superuser.com/questions/1605647/why-cant-i-use-my-registered-nick-your-nick-is-owned-by-purple-work1-2-3 - did all three of those commands, "regain" helped.

[15:48] <timo> REGAIN disconnects an old user session, or somebody attempting to use your nickname without authorization then changes your nickname to the given nickname.

[15:49] <[Coke]> my old session was probably the issue. whee, my irc now back to normal.

[15:50] <timo> :+1:

[15:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have a data file in the "resources" directory, what is the proper way to use it in tests in the "t" directory?

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am naively using my $fileName = $*CWD ~ '/resources/data.json now, but that does not seem proper at all.

[18:29] <tonyo> i don't think you have access to %?RESOURCES in your tests, just in the module itself

[23:29] <tonyo> your module needs to export your resources for your test to see them

[23:29] <tonyo> you can `use SomeModule` and then access their resources
