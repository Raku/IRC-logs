[13:43] <tbrowder> i want to have an "autosave" option in a compiled module. i only "use" that module once. can i put the action for saving a file in an END block inside that module and have it work?

[13:44] <tbrowder> or would it have to be in a bin file?

[13:45] <tbrowder> the docs are detailed, but i don't see a good example of that use.

[13:46] <tbrowder> i'll present a gist later today for comment.

[13:53] <lizmat_> tbrowder: an END block in a module will always be run when the process exits

[14:18] <tbrowder> ok, i got it to work. in the unit class i needed to (1) duplicate the attr vars i needed as ordinary my vars, the use them in the END block.

[14:19] <tbrowder> did that duping with a TWEAK

[14:20] <tbrowder> i think that will do the trick in the actual class when i flesh it all out.

[14:24] <tbrowder> may be crude but following a paraphrase dr knuth's rule "premature optimization 'is the root of wasted coding effort'"

[16:33] <tbrowder> can i call a class method with self inside submethod TWEAK?

[16:33] <tbrowder> and change $!attr values in it?

[16:56] *** jpn left
[17:00] <lizmat> tbrowder: yes, why not?  TWEAK is a (sub)method just as any other method, it is just being called *for* you at some point

[20:57] <tbrowder> lizmat: question on Git::Blame::File,

[21:02] <tbrowder> i'm in some dir and the file i want info on  is at /path/to/file. should the .git already exist!

[21:03] <tbrowder> s/!/?/

[21:19] <tbrowder> i assume i must create the repo dir with the file of interest in that dir or a subdir. then the path to the file of interest defines the .git repo that Git::Blame::File uses for its purposes.

[22:11] <tbrowder> never mind, i

[22:12] <tbrowder> see how it works.
