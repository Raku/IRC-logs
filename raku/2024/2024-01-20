[03:59] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> So I have an enum for "packet subtype", where the values are going to get packed into a single byte along with a packet type, and I want to be able to reuse values across different keys, which is totally possible, but I then want to be able to recover the correct enum value from a plain integer for incoming packets

[04:00] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> my thought was to have a For[PacketType $FOR] { ... } role which I could mix into the integer values, e.g. 0b0000001 but For[PacketType::Whatever]

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> however, that results in a somewhat cryptic error, "Incompatible MROs in P6opaque rebless for types Int+{For[PacketType]} mixin and PacketSubtype"

[04:02] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I was wondering if anyone had a way around this or a different idea for a nice way to achieve what I'm trying to achieve

[09:41] <gfldex> @roguerakudev If that ^^^ doesn't work for you, I would suspect an only Rakudo version.

[12:47] <tbrowder__> ok, i just released an updated Abbreviation with default action to provide a regex "alternation" (not a junction) for a single word.

[12:49] <tbrowder__> for example: my $a = abbrev "Args"; say $a; # OUTPUT: A|Ar|Arg|Args

[12:52] <tbrowder__> i

[12:54] <tbrowder__> arg, can't even remember proper module name, plural: Abbreviations

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> gfldex: yeah, sure enough I'm on a somewhat old rakudo version on this machine

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Hm, but even on 2023.12 I'm still getting the same error

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am very curious about anythin use lib related.

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> oh, but not if I have only one enum value listed in the enum

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> very interesting...

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> it's not a weird precedence thing either, because even with parens to make it explicit, same result

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> m: role R[$a] { has $.type = $a }; enum foo (bar => 42 but R['answer'], baz => 41 but R['question']); dd bar.value.type;

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> You know you're really programming when you hit compiler bugs like this :^)
