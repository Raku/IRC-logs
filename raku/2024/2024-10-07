[00:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @razord Don't worry -- the average age of Raku programmers is 56.

[00:56] <[Coke]> ... That feels a little high, but not too far off. :)

[16:52] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/10/07/2024-41-knowlite/

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I know it's intentional but seeing Mondrian...

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> hehe :´)

[17:25] <lizmat> Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan (Dutch: [ˈpitər kɔrˈneːlɪs ˈmɔndrijaːn]; 7 March 1872 – 1 February 1944), known after 1906 as Piet Mondrian (/piːt ˈmɒndriɑːn/, US also /- ˈmɔːn-/, Dutch: [pit ˈmɔndrijɑn])

[17:26] <lizmat> from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian

[17:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> yeeee

[17:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> as I said I know it's intentional

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but he made a lot of pre-war paintings in the city above river

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Mondrian is the name for pharoś TK no?

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> or just one of their examples, tbh Pharo is Emacs on roids

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat (and others) What would be the best package to "parse" a Pod6 file into a data structure of sections or/and paragraphs? (Hierarchical or flat.)

[18:12] *** Bulla joined

[18:31] <lizmat> hehe...  needed some sustenance  :-)

[18:32] <lizmat> antononcube: would $file.IO.slurp.AST do it for you?

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> wide definition of "parse"

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> 😄

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> maybe a Racket-esque would be nice for AST representation

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> or is there something else in the works?

[18:48] *** Aedil left
[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Im working on somewthing with raylib for visual scripting either way but for call stacks; not so sure how Raku AST manipulation + macros is conceptialized

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> if global scope 👀

[19:01] <timo> can you elaborate on that a bit? what do you mean by "for call stacks"?

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I dont wanna clobber your IRC so I was hoping to find an ez img that shows it

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1724/1*14SNyTCdToyGQf1GT7MpZQ.png

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> something akin to that

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I am not sure, it might work...

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well that still a poor example; but imagine I send "raku message.raku lmao" and https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128154120000103-f04-147-9780128154120.gif and you'd get the methods that did something or not; it's message dispatching Ruby-style ig 😛

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Arend Aren't you trying to reinvent YAMLScript?! And what is all that racket about Racket?!

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> it's more to show the nodes

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and where a routine may have picked something up

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> it still goes down the full list

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I'll just implement a bare-bones thing

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> so it's more clear

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> xD

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sorry, I do not understand. Are you trying to make a DSL (and/or a "conversational agent") for a debugger? Of Raku?

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but it's a node tree with callbacks at the end of it; so you'd want the macros before it or after it turns into bytecode I guess

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> no not a DSL

[19:33] *** ptc left
[19:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Raku supports most of it already

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well all of it really, but the question was mostly about macros...

[19:46] <[Coke]> There is some macro support, but "real" macros won't come until the RakuAST project completes.

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> ye and I asked if a DrRacket-esque tool is in the works to show a syntax tree 😛

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and if macros are also runtime/global scope 👀  since thats a hell I avoid :kek:

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> would be very lispy tho

[19:57] *** floyza joined
[19:57] <timo> you can interleave runtime and compile time in raku

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I'll make it in Raku either way so if it ends up being some pharorakumacstein with 0 use but for me it's ok

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> 🧑🏻‍🔬 💣

[20:11] <timo> as long as you can put it in a docker container, barely anybody will care what it's written in (if it's user-facing, rather than a library others are supposed to use)

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> seeing my gripes started with Blender + Octave, Im skipping over Python out of my own volition

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> hehe

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Python: 🤮🤮🤮; Octave: 🤷

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> ever used matlab? I havent, but they say it's similar

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> MATLAB: 🤷

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That should be read as "MATLAB -- Meh."

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> When I worked at Wolfram Research, Inc.  (the makers of Mathematica) many of the developers knew MATLAB.

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is nothing to know, in a sense, it is a simple language.

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> At that time, MATLAB was a primary competitor of Mathematica.

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well theres Julia but my deployment is basically all arm64

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Nowadays, I am somewhat puzzled if people use MATLAB. (I do "understand" using Octave.)

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Julia is like Obama.

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Got an award just for showing up.

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is lowest priority target language of my DSLs. (But it is in the list.)

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> arent you a LLM anyway

[20:26] <[Coke]> no idea what that's referring to. maybe keep any political dings off channel.

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If one knows and uses R or Mathematica, Julia is not that needed, or "new", or interesting.

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke The Julia vs Obama analogy is based in facts. (About the award they got.)

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Arend "arent you a LLM anyway" -- yes and no. I would be forced to deal or know extensively about LLM, regardless of how much I want or like them.

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> sadly I cant use them

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> "sadly"

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> They are overrated, but that is hard to convey without first hand experience.

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> unless it's to draw animu waifus

[20:30] <timo> you can't say that when openai is spending billions of money so that everybody can use their LLMs

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo 🙂 Hence, overrated, right?

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well I am mostly a freelancer but technically software dev for health sector

[20:30] <timo> i believe they are overrated, yeah

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> so copilot etc are all no bueno tools

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I already ahve to work with outerspace lojban names

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> just to be sure

[20:31] *** [Coke] left
[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have heard good things about Copilot. I just use Raku-LLM for those kind of task.

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> turning co-pilot on and you just added 2 code audits and a few legal reviews 🙂

[20:32] <timo> i wish we could have a standard for a central "fuck off with your AI product" switch. kind of like the "do not track" header, but also for desktop applications and whatnot

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ("Eat your own dog food", etc.)

[20:34] <timo> if you make me click an "X" in a popup because i'm not interested in whatever chat assistant or whatever, i will probably not stay with your whatever-it-is

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo Agh, that is the topic I mentioned I won't discuss in my latest published presentation.

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> hypervisor is me life 😢

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and guix-style deployments lel

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo Here is one of my slides (as a proof):

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1292948423191826474/Streamlined-spying-2024-09-16T13.23.20.663876Z-2.png?ex=6705978d&is=6704460d&hm=b008f8d7943184e248cc906a5363db4a8580b60062f1e6dee8370d4dea40d13b&

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but code review is brutal enough with MIT license gettign rejected unless prior clearance

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> since there's attribution version and no attribution version

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and they never specify where

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> or big brains that put copyright marks liek 2009-2011 in source code

[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> amazing, Dutch law doesnt work that way; it's now unusable unless I know everyone in that list is in NL 😛

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> hypervisor ≈≈≈ AWS?

[20:38] <timo> don't worry about it, just put "No Copyright Intended" in the readme or description or somewhere else visible

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> can be few different things

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but obv not AWS

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmmm... I think Arend is Dutch, and timo is German.

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> lol who I am is not a secret 🥲

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (If I recall correctly... I did not ask an LLM.)

[20:40] <timo> i'm german, yup

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Dutch since 1817 or so before then a Prussian!

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> antononcube: sometimes Mirage OS 🙂

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> timo, just say you are Dutch for my sake hehe

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo From/in Karlsruhe?

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> everyone thinks German = lederhosen and dirndls

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and celebrating oktoberfest in 3 diff months

[20:43] <timo> haven't been in karlsruhe in a little while, i've that set in some places but it's no longer accurate

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Learning German helped me learning English. Everyone in my highschool who studied German speaks now both German and English.

[20:44] <timo> but i don't feel like putting my semi-precise location on line at the moment

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> nooo

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> you learned Bavarian 😠

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> no one understands Bavarians

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> need to get down from the mountains so do they drop a few consonants, take  a breather 😛

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... Danish is like that, for other reasons, I assume. (28 vowels, 6 consunants.)

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Danes drop too many consonants at the start

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> lol odin I mean cmon

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well Germans say midweek I guess

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> When I spoke Danish in Norway people understood me much better than when I spoke Danish in Denmark.

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "midweek" -- Bulgrian and Russian use similar names.

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I just think of what a Swede would say and switch to e -> jag jeg

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> elsker deg etc hest 😛

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> do any of you ever deploy to macOS?

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> or Windows for that matter, they'll just deploy Linux 🙂

[21:16] *** guifa joined
[21:17] * guifa is about to embark on his first Cro project!

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Arend Deploy what? I mostly work on macOS.

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, one of my recent Raku projects passes its tests only macOS. I am having hard time making it work on Linux. (Gave up on Windoes long time ago.)

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well, WebGL works ig 🥲

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Good lack! (My first Cro project was "doing it like a Cro.")

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Windows users can use WSL, macOS ppl something similar right hehe

[21:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, but I never succeeded getting a Windows project build in GitHub's Actions.

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> been well over a decade since I built something for Windows I think 🤔

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> tiled screen Windows 8 yee

[21:40] *** Sgeo joined
[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> kinda says everything that I can drop mac, windows and everything else out of my life except whatsapp because gf doesnt want to use anything else

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> thats not even vendor lock in lel

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but oh well

[22:03] <guifa> eegads, so many typos in my README.md of Timezones::ZoneInfo

[22:04] <guifa> in bold at the top: "current version of the database 2022f".  Then down in the version history "updated to version "2025b" (should be 2024b) 

[22:24] <timo> what's wrong with 2022f?

[22:24] <timo> oh, you mean it's lacking an "is" or something

[22:25] <timo> maybe a "the"

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa you can use large language models to do the editing corrections for you.
