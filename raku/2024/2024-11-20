[08:45] <librasteve_> ab5tract: beta 29 works for me - will keep an eye for regressions

[08:45] <librasteve_> appreciate the keepy uppy

[08:48] <ab5tract> Cheers! The REPL got broken so upgrade to beta 30 if that matters to you :)

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There are two Raku packages dealing with chess notations: ‚ÄúChess‚Äù and ‚ÄúFEN::Grammar‚Äù. I am considering having a separate package ‚ÄúChess::Plot‚Äù for SVG and other formats plots of chess positions.

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But maybe those plotting functions should be in ‚ÄúChess‚Äù?

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure how actively developed ‚ÄúChess‚Äù is‚Ä¶

[12:20] <lizmat> I guess you should contact the author Lucien Grondin by issue ?

[12:32] *** guifa left
[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sure. I have not used ‚Äúc

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ‚ÄúChess‚Äù yet. I found a bug in ‚ÄúFEN::Grammar‚Äù and contacted vushu.

[18:55] <[Coke]> patrickb: are the rakubrew instructions for adding to your powershell profile online or able to be re-printed from a fresh powershell?

[18:55] <[Coke]> (I have multiple powershells on this windows box, and only one of them has been setup to run rakubrew, apparently)

[18:57] <[Coke]> found it - full path to installed rakubrew, "init"

[18:59] <[Coke]> (sadly, this newer version of powershell also doesn't do utf8 cleanly

[19:23] <[Coke]> Aha. need to run this instead of chcp 65001 - $OutputEncoding = [Console]::InputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding

[19:23] <[Coke]> What a PITA.
