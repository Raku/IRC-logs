[08:32] <jaguart> @librasteve - you're right - I've learned something new - woohoo optional tags esp. the table shortening. chrome debug shows them when exploring the doc, but a wget shows that they are not actually present on the website.

[18:45] <lizmat> weekly: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/full-stack-coder-wanted-for-work-our-Raku-based-website_~021831331863359991212/

[18:45] <notable6__> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting! I worked for Elance before they merged with oDesk into UpWork. I would say, because of my analysis of their data, business, etc.

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, note the (hourly) salary of that job.

[18:59] <jdv> lizmat: how'd you find that?

[18:59] <jdv> that

[18:59] <jdv> s surprising

[19:00] <lizmat> it was mailed to me

[19:01] <jdv> weird the assessment mentions raku and perl 5 (not just perl)

[19:01] <lizmat> yeah, the hourly salary is pretty low

[19:04] <jdv> seems typical upwork.  google level work for 3rd world wages.

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that is pretty typical of upwork, I would say

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Pretty much "race to the bottom" with the bidding on jobs protocols.

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i don't know whether to cheer that well educated people in less affluent countries can make a good living (vis-a-vis the local pay rates) even if they miss a career in the TCS / HTC / Wipro sweatshops or whether to cry at the low value placed on coders and the threat to high skilled work near me

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this just arrived in my inbox London Perl Mongers is in need of a new organizer ‚Äì why not you?

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ($30 a month though - so much for "volunteering")

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well i went in for $30 for a month and ... errr ... it's me

[20:02] *** jaguart left
[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw I have been a bit concerned about the terminology we have for raku folk, so I propose we change from rakuuns to rakuteers

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (kinda half rocketeers and half racketeers)

[20:07] <[Coke]> I have never been a fan of rakuun, fwiw.

[20:07] <[Coke]> wondering if a play on raconteur would work.

[20:08] <[Coke]> Not sure we need one.

[20:24] *** Aedil left
[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke How about cocoon?

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Cocoon Coke" has a ring to it...

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think it is even "Canadian Cocoon Coke", right?

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the only place this is set out in the discord user flair ‚Ä¶ propose we just drop that

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah Raku HTML::Functional

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is the name of my person
