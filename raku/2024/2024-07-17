[00:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke you can check / increase ulimit in your OS.

[00:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As for "Cro::HTTP::Client" -- I thought it was a good option making the LLM packages, but turned out is not. I would have occasionally SSL certificate problems, and I found it to be under-documented. Hence, I de-Cro-ed the LLM packages abd moved to using "HTTP::Tiny".

[00:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I no problems so far with "HTTP::Tiny".)

[02:59] <lucs> (Off-topic:) Welp, I had a lot of fun today, figuring out why a disk I have on an offsite machine had "no space left on device" when I tried to scp stuff to it.

[03:00] <lucs> Turns out that in 2021 I had created a test user account and had this user running a cron job every two hours starting in April 2021.

[03:00] <lucs> But mistakes were made :-)

[03:00] <lucs> My crontab said  "* */2 * * * ...", so it ran 60 times, once each minute, every two hours, not just once every two hours.

[03:01] <lucs> And it turns out the cron job was writing to STDERR and thus sending a short email message (733 bytes) to the test user each time.

[03:01] <lucs> And I had not looked at that user since pretty much the start, so over three years ago.

[03:01] <lucs> So in '/home/<that user>/Maildir/.../new' I found 744,945 unread 733 My crontab said  "* */2 * * * ...", so it ran 60 times, once each minute, every two hours, not just once every two hours.byte email messages, consuming all the inodes on the device :-)

[03:01] <lucs> Oops

[03:02] <lucs> So in '/home/<that user>/Maildir/.../new' I found 744,945 unread 733 byte email messages, consuming all the inodes on the device :-)

[03:08] *** jpn joined
[03:09] <MasterDuke> and you'd think 744,945 inodes ought to be enough for anybody...

[03:11] <lucs> It's a pretty small disk, about 6G, but still, eh :)

[08:11] <blendux> Good morning all! ü¶ã Will Raku development migrate away from GitHub at some point? I've searched online and haven't found any indication that this has previously been a topic of conversation.

[08:16] <patrickb> blendux: There are no such plans whatsoever. Why would you think so?

[08:18] *** jpn joined
[08:21] <blendux> I've seen a couple FLOSS organisations advocating for moving away from GitHub. The implementation and usage of Copilot brings up ethical concerns, alongside Microsoft's unpopuparity. Do Raku devs feel any particular way about this?

[08:39] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> If your repository is on the internet, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs being crawled wherever it is

[08:39] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> It‚Äôs a different issue from e.g. the crawling of private repos

[08:40] <patrickb> I guess the current stance is that we have neither the drive, nor the manpower for a migration. At least I didn't notice much uproar in the community so far.

[09:26] <patrickb> vendethiel: is it a p6c aka old repo based ecosystem module?

[09:26] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> should be, yes

[09:26] <patrickb> Not entirely sure, but Ithink that has effectively been shutdown.

[09:28] <patrickb> lizmat knows the details. I think a snapshot was taken, and persisted, but that snapshot is not updated anymore.

[09:28] <patrickb> the way forward is to move the module to the fez ecosystem.

[09:29] <patrickb> I am not entirely sure the above is actually true. I am sure it was the plan, unsure if it was carried out to completion.

[09:31] <lizmat> it wasn't: it's still an open problem solving issue

[09:31] <lizmat> still I'd recommend moving modules from p6c to zef

[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I will, but I‚Äôd rather not doing from my work computer

[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> But PRing p6c I can do from my work computer :)

[09:45] <lizmat> don't you have a commit bit ?

[09:46] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I probably do? I just don‚Äôt remember which repo I should update

[10:13] <patrickb> vendethiel: On an unrelated note, are you interested in working on Cro? I'm currently trying to get an overview of who wants to continue carrying the flag and is willing to take on responsibility. I think this is good to know to sketch up sane commit and release policies.

[10:14] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I haven‚Äôt done much on Cro since I left Edument, tbh

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I still want to get Comma in a working state, but I spent two weekends on it and I think I went in the wrong direction

[10:20] <patrickb> Ok, good to know. I hope you manage to progress with Comma. A nice piece of technology that is.
