[12:51] <tbrowder> extacting txt from pdf is very useful. instead of spending a half hour or so manually entering utility costs for a year in a spreadsheet, i can spend hours creating a raku prog to do it for me! üòÑ

[13:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder - i wrote PDF::Extract for this purpose- feel free to try it!

[13:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also Contact https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Contact

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Net::Google::Sheets so you can paste the results to a Google sheet

[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> these modules are intended as (skeletal) components that can be fleshed out and reused

[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: (belated) thanks for the pointer on private multis - i guess it‚Äôs sensible to have multis participate fully in method despatch (for roles, inheritance and so on)

[19:30] <Imightbeaturtle> Hello everyone! I'm new here

[19:30] <lizmat> hi Imightbeaturtle!

[19:31] <quib> Hello, Imightbeaturtle

[19:31] <Imightbeaturtle> I've only been using Raku for a couple months and I love how expressive it is, my only other experience with programming is with Java and Raku honestly just blew my mind. 

[19:31] <Imightbeaturtle> I'd love to contribute anyway I can

[19:31] <lizmat> hehe, glad to hear that  :-)

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Imightbeaturtle Hmm... I am not sure what is our turtle policy. I think raccoons might be welcome.

[19:32] <Imightbeaturtle> oof

[19:32] <lizmat> antononcube: come on?

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Imightbeaturtle Are you, by any chance, a raccoon that thinks it might be a turtle?

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, turtle are fine -- tend to be wise.

[19:32] <Imightbeaturtle> not the last time I checked 

[19:34] <lizmat> Imightbeaturtle: what would you like to contribute with?   in the ecosystem, in core, in marketing?  writing blog posts?

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Imightbeaturtle How long have you programmed in Java?

[19:34] <Imightbeaturtle> A couple years, not professionaly though

[19:35] <Imightbeaturtle> lizmat: Ecosystem would be nice

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Imightbeaturtle  Consider re-programming your favorite Java packages in Raku using LLMs.

[19:36] <lizmat> Imightbeaturtle: get https://raku.land/zef:skaji/App::Mi6

[19:36] <lizmat> then get a fez login: https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/fez

[19:37] <lizmat> then run "mi6 new Foo::Bar" and start programming  :-)

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Imightbeaturtle I am always looking for Raku enthusiasts: (1) try and regularly use Raku Chatbooks, and (2) more generally, use / access LLMs via Raku.

[19:39] <Imightbeaturtle> @antononcube why raku chatbooks? 

[19:39] <quib> i have been training llm's about programming lately and i find like 1/8 of the time they get confused and start writing perl5 when i ask for raku

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> <Imightbeaturtle> "why raku chatbooks?" -- short introduction video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNpIGUAwZB8

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There are a few other related movies some short, some long.

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Basically, using Raku Chatbooks lets you do Literate Programming with convenient (I think) LLM inclusion.

[19:57] <Imightbeaturtle> I see 

[19:59] <Imightbeaturtle> I use this package right? 

[19:59] <Imightbeaturtle> https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Jupyter::Chatbook

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes !

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ideally, you have used Jupyter before. Also, I prefer using the Jupyter chatbooks via Visual Studio Code.

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @quib What is the complexity of the programs you tried? And, yes, often I get Perl instead of Raku with LLMs. But most recent OpenAI models tend to produce good enough Raku results.

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @quib I have started -- and not finished -- a few articles / blog posts about LLM failings for tasks in different "nerdy" sub-cultures.

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: its a wrapper on poppler that is called via shell from raku with pdftotext

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> poppler installs the pdftotext cmd on linux like machines (I have tested with a mac) https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext
