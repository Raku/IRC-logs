[17:19] <tbrowder> is anyone using Inline::Python successfully? Or able to fix it? that would be a great help for getting ppl looking at raku.

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have never been able to install "Inline::Python".

[17:43] <[Coke]> I think my python is too new - does it only work with python2, not 3?

[17:43] <[Coke]> ah, no, probably just built wrong.

[17:44] <[Coke]> have a vanilla python brew without -fPIC

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is another problem -- too many pythons. (AKA "Game of Pythons.")

[18:22] <tbrowder> ok, i have it built and zef-installed locally (Debian 11)

[18:23] <tbrowder> i went ahead and cloned it with prep for PR and rakuized it. anyone got a trial raku prog that uses it?

[18:24] <tbrowder> it works only with python 3

[18:26] <tbrowder> i need it for use with fontforge to convert ps type 1 fonts to opentype

[19:22] <ab5tract> every time I think I'm getting close to a fully-updated Comma plugin, it turns out I've still got miles to go

[19:22] <ab5tract> let's hope this time it's different :)

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good luck!

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this seems to be a fairly good recipe ... or you can just run my df

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5stract - 'tis much valued

[20:51] <tonyo1> i have a docker image if you just want stock raku that's been being generated now since 2019

[20:52] <tonyo1> https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tonyodell/rakudo-nightly/tags?page_size=&ordering=-last_updated&name=

[20:52] <tonyo1> if you're just wanting a base 

[20:52] <tonyo1> might be missing a day here or there 

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo1 Meaning, that Docker image has had successful generations and uploads to docker-hub since 2019?

[21:02] <tonyo1> yea

[21:03] <tonyo1> it's a nightly image, so every day since it started less maybe a few when the CI failed or a bad commit was made to main
