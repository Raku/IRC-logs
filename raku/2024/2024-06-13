[09:28] <lizmat> or not at all, unless someone fixes the (apparent) GLR breakage

[11:11] <tbrowder> [Coke]: ref Text::Wrap and _ i think i see now why your solution should work for GraphQL by naming the specifics of *which* Text::Wrap. and looking at the number of open issues of _, i think that reinforces the importance of putting such modules where more than one person can fix it.

[11:13] <tbrowder> and also makes me want to be very specific about deps in my own stuff

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5stract Yeah. One is forced to upgrade to JupyterLab if the one wants to use the newest Pythone versions and packages.

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not like Jupyter that much, I do not like using it over a "standard" web browser like Safari or Chrome. I use the Jupyter framework mostly through VS Code (or VSCodium) and PyCharm / IntelliJ.

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This package "Statistics::LinearRegression" seems old and the author has not published anything since 2017. Should it be made a community package?

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To clarify, I want to use "Statistics::LinearRegression" (or similar) in a presentation, but I do not like the signatures of "Statistics::LinearRegression". I am willing to change them to a better set if that package is a community package.

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @a5tract Sorry, I misread the the repository. I have JupyterLab but I have not used JupyterLab Desktop.

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I might try it and see can I use it for the latest presentation I plan to make.

[18:05] <tbrowder> antononcube: +1 for making it a community module

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I tried JupyterLab Desktop -- it is the same as JupyterLab, "just" with its own browser. I cannot use them because they do not display / render JavasCript graphics .

[18:24] <ab5tract> Ah, I see..  that‚Äôs disappointing

[18:24] <ab5tract> JavaScript graphics == Canvas?

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract No, not Canvas. I am using D3.js and Google Charts.

[18:28] <ab5tract> They have to either use canvas or render bitmap, no?

[18:29] <ab5tract> I guess SVG is the middle ground

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, idea do they use Canvas or not. I do not recall seeing anything with "canvas" in the corresponding code for them.

[18:36] <ab5tract> ‚ÄúCharts are rendered using HTML5/SVG technology‚Äù ‚Äî https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs

[18:37] *** jpn joined
[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Which, I guess, means using "Canvas"?

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine btw what did you decide to do regarding migrations for Red?

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> again apologies for not getting back to you sooner, but work and other side projects have been occupying my tie

[21:32] <tbrowder> [Coke]: i‚Äôm ready to fork GraphQL in my name. is just changing auth and updating (increasing ‚Äú) ver num enough for now without a release yet? should Curt make one more update mentioning auth change before i publish any changes (sounds cleanest way to me)?
