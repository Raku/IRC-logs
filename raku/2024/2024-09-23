[10:48] <ab5tract> we might be able to have more success if the application arrives via the Raku Foundation

[10:49] <ab5tract> but regardless, it seems that the current Ultimate profiler doesn't read whatever profiling information that the sandboxed IntelliJ + Comma instance outputs (if it outputs anything at all)

[11:58] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/09/23/2024-39-fun-with-raku/

[12:25] <ab5tract> antononcube: latest HEAD / beta 11  should fix the issue.

[17:46] <simona24> hello i have a question! i'm working on a project for school and i need to make a poster with the most important updates for all relevant programming languages

[17:46] <simona24> so my question is: what are the most important updates of raku after the year 2019?

[17:46] <simona24> for now i have:

[17:46] <simona24> 2020 Raku 2020

[17:46] <simona24> 2021 Raku 2021

[17:46] <simona24> 2022 Raku 2022

[17:46] <simona24> 2023 Raku 2023

[17:46] <simona24> 2024 Raku 2024

[17:46] <simona24> but i can't really decide which ones are the most important

[18:30] *** sena_kun joined
[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> simona: this is a kinda odd question for raku ... each release is a braid of development threads and each of those has its specific status ... also raku uses semantic versioning, so strictly speaking the most important releases are the major ones (6.c [christmas],6.d [divali] and now the core team is busy on 6.e. PREVIEW [eide?])

[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> simona: at first glance it looks like you are an AI - in which case I encourage you to research our human religious festivals

[19:51] <tellable6__> Xliff, I saw japhb 2024-06-27T19:42:31Z in #raku-dev: <japhb> jdv++

[19:51] <Xliff> japhb: You around?

[19:51] <tellable6__> 2024-09-19T10:38:24Z #raku <ab5tract> Xliff: what are you expecting exactly?

[19:51] <tellable6__> 2024-09-19T14:16:58Z #raku <ab5tract> Xliff: for what it's worth, it seems to be working in RakuAST

[19:53] <Xliff> ab5tract: What did you mean by this - https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2024-09-19.html#07:53

[19:54] <ab5tract> m: my $n = 2.2; $n.^can("floor").map(*.file.gist.say)

[19:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «SETTING::src/core.c/Rational.rakumod␤SETTING::src/core.c/Cool.rakumod␤»

[19:54] <ab5tract> huh, it seems to be working without RakuAST as well

[19:54] <Xliff> O I C

[19:55] <Xliff> No, this is a part of my app server code (which I am still trying desperately to release)

[19:55] <Xliff> And I'm trying to .^can against a multi with inheritance and that's what it was returning.

[19:55] <Xliff> It -by no means- should be going back into the setting.

[19:55] <Xliff> Hmmm...

[19:56] <ab5tract> ah, I didn't get that part. I thought the issue was with core-supplied methods only returning the stub declarations

[19:56] <Xliff> m: class A { multi method a (Int) { }; multi method a (Str) { } }; A.^can("a").map( *.file.gist.say )

[19:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «SETTING::src/core.c/stubs.rakumod␤»

[19:57] <Xliff> And there it is!

[19:57] <Xliff> And now it's going to core.c/stubs!

[19:57] <Xliff> I had to work around my it with another method. It's weird.

[19:58] <Xliff> Are there any TUIs with a high level interface for making scrolling windows?

[19:58] <timo> for raku or like, in general

[19:59] <timo> also, usable in raku, or written in raku

[20:02] <ab5tract> m: class A { proto method a(|) {*}; multi method a (Int) { }; multi method a (Str) { } }; A.^can("a").map( *.file.gist.say )

[20:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «<tmp>␤»

[20:02] <ab5tract> that actually makes sense

[20:02] <ab5tract> if you don't declare a proto, we stub one for you

[20:03] <ab5tract> Xliff ^^

[20:04] <timo> so .^can will not give you a list of the candidates, probably unless you provide a Capture to do multi dispatch lookup with?

[20:06] <timo> m: class A { proto method a(|) {*}; multi method a (Int) { }; multi method a (Str) { } }; A.^can("a").>>.candidates.>>.raku.say

[20:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «((multi method a (A $:: Int $, *%_) { #`(Method|4807892315128) ... } multi method a (A $:: Str $, *%_) { #`(Method|4807892315264) ... }))␤»

[20:07] <timo> ok .^can doesn't take a signature or anything like that

[20:08] <Xliff> timo: That's .cando on Method, I think.

[20:09] <Xliff> m: class A { proto method a(|) {*}; multi method a (Int) { }; multi method a (Str) { } }; A.^can("a").>>.candidates.>>.cando( \(1) ).say

[20:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «((() ()))␤»

[20:09] <timo> m: class A { proto method a(|) {*}; multi method a (Int) { }; multi method a (Str) { } }; A.^can("a")>>.cando(\(A:D, IntStr:D)).>>.raku.say

[20:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ee68bffd: OUTPUT: «((multi method a (A $:: Int $, *%_) { #`(Method|2796941618440) ... } multi method a (A $:: Str $, *%_) { #`(Method|2796941618576) ... }))␤»

[20:09] <timo> don't forget you need to supply the invocant as first argument

[20:09] <Xliff> Ahaha! Yep.

[20:17] <Xliff> .seen bduggan

[20:17] <tellable6__> Xliff, I saw bduggan 2023-03-14T18:02:06Z in #raku-dev: <bduggan> Okay, cool -- good to know, and thanks for the comments

[21:03] * timo rocks out to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ccGjar4Es

[21:06] <ab5tract> Listening to "I can only count to 4" .. coincidence? I think not https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4OQV4kxd/Screenshot%202024-09-23%20at%2023.06.04.png

[21:14] <japhb> Xliff: I've been AFK for a while dealing with $life.  Which means I'm horribly out of date with the IRC channels.  What's on your mind?
