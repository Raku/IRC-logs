[08:53] <gfldex> Do we have a "representative" on https://lobste.rs ?

[08:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if so, please can i get an invite?

[08:58] <gfldex> That's why I'm asking. :)

[08:59] <gfldex> There are alot ... halve-truths about Raku dropped on that site.

[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> grenzo ++ … does this mean cro-http needs to change docs to reflect making a self cert? (i had got the idea that the fake-tls was to avoid that step)

[11:44] <evalable6> tbrowder__, rakudo-moar 5c9156e26: OUTPUT: «»

[11:50] <tbrowder__> i'm having probs with using when blocks to parse @*ARGS elements. the user has to identify an input file name and i code it like this fragment: my $ifil; for @*ARGS  { when not $ifil.defined { $ifil = $_ if $_.IO.f }  };

[11:51] <tbrowder__> that works for defining $ifil, but following when blocks are ignored. i've tried using proceed but no help.

[11:52] <tbrowder__> i've had some success putting that block last, just before the default block.

[11:56] <tbrowder__> should i just use a for loop?

[12:05] <kjp> tbrowder: Are you expecting, on each iteration of the for loop, for that when clause to execute, and then have the following code (more when clauses?) executed?

[13:40] <tbrowder__> yes. i suspect i'm attempting an invalid attempt. the docs are a bit confusing on the issue. in the meantime, i've reverted to a for loop and all is well. (sounds like a good entry for a trap for the unwary).

[13:42] <lizmat> tbrowder_:  how about:   my $ifil = @*ARGS.first(*.IO.f);

[13:42] <lizmat> tbrowder__ ^^

[14:08] <tbrowder__> thnx, but i want file to be entered in arbitrary position

[14:09] <tbrowder__> next prob though, how to properly test for bool True or False from a sub return?

[14:11] <tbrowder__> m: sub bool($f) { False }; my $v = boo(5); say $v

[14:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar febe8ee86: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    boo used at line 1. Did you mean 'bool'?␤␤»

[14:12] <tbrowder__> m: sub bool($v) { False}; my $v = bool(5); dd $v

[14:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar febe8ee86: OUTPUT: «Mu $v = Bool::False␤»

[14:16] <tbrowder__> m: sub bool($v --> Bool) { False}; my $res = bool(5); if $res.so { say "true" } else { say "false"};

[14:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar febe8ee86: OUTPUT: «false␤»

[14:17] <tbrowder__> any cleaner way to do that?

[14:20] <lizmat> tbrowder__  but my code allows it to be at any position ?

[14:32] <tbrowder__> sorry, i see that.

[14:35] *** jpn left
[14:35] <tbrowder__> so can that be combined with a method to also remove it from @*ARGS

[14:36] <lizmat> than you could ask for the index where it's found

[14:37] <tbrowder__> like: $ifil = @*ARGS.first(*.IO.f).shift.

[14:37] <lizmat> e.g.: my $index = @*ARGS.first(*.IO.f, :k);   and then splice out that element out of @*ARGS

[14:38] *** epony joined
[14:39] <tbrowder__> thnx, but for my use i think a for loop is simpler.

[14:44] <lizmat> tbrowder__: or create a "sub eject" and use that  :-)

[14:49] <lizmat> afk&

[14:50] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^10; sub eject(@a is raw, &target) { with @a.first(&target, :k) { @a.splice($_,1).head } else { Nil } }; say @a.&eject(* == 3); say @a

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I just saw the concerns on reddit about apt-get rakudo

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1apmed0/rakudo_cant_find_libraries/

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I get that rakudo.org is keen to showcase all the many ways to get and run rakudo, but I am worried that it (and we) are spread too thin and that newbies will get a less than awesome experience from many of the ways listed
