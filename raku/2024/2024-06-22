[07:22] <wayland76> I've seen the basic Singleton examples around the place, but is there a fuller example hiding in a package somewhere that I can look at?

[09:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This resource access class uses Singleton: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Chemistry-Stoichiometry/blob/main/lib/Chemistry/Stoichiometry/ResourceAccess.rakumod

[09:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I pretty much followed the example in docs.raku.org .

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Another set of namespace questions. I am working on a package for graph algorithms — the discrete mathematics structure called “graph.”

[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was considering the namespace “Math::Graph”, but I see in the Perl5 ecosystem there is a “Graph” package. Should I use that name?

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Graphs can be seen as not just mathematical, or course, but also a “computer science” domain.

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think, using something like “GraphTheory” would give too high hopes…

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the Perl5  “Graph”: https://metacpan.org/pod/Graph

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the one I am working on: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Graph

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Needless to say Graph theory is huge. But certain algorithms like path and cycle finding are relatively easy to implement and fundamental mathematics-wise and computer-science-wise.

[13:50] <lizmat> FWIW, Graph:: look ok to me

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Great, thanks!

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, I was considering re-programming Perl5’s “Graph” into Raku, but it turned out it was easier to write the algorithms directly in Raku. (To me at least…)

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Having the fast shortest path finding in graphs is going to be quite a booster for the Geography related projects I am currently focusing on…

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, I far have tested Raku’s “Graph” path finding algorithms on very small graphs.

[13:54] <lizmat> getting the exact semantics in the P5 modules was way more difficult than getting the functionality  :-)

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What do you mean? The naming of the class methods according to Graph theory’s glossary?

[14:00] <lizmat> I mean, it makes more sense to re-imagine in Raku  :-)

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Haha — ok, yeah.

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I strongly suspect Graph path and cycle finding can be good showcases of “ParaSeq”.

[14:05] <lizmat> I hope so  :-)

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The question is how explicit that should be — inside “Graph”, as method options, or an outside modifier.

[14:08] <lizmat> maybe you wouldn't need to make that choice: ParaSeq should be good enough for >>.foo

[14:08] *** jpn joined
[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is what I meant by “outsider modifier”.

[14:10] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This might become an important question soon, since I need “Graph” on fairly large graphs. (Like country / continent route network graph.)

[14:13] *** jpn left
[14:55] <lizmat> antononcube ParaSeq.hyperize(x, $degree) will *not* hyperize at all for $degree == 1

[14:56] <lizmat> so it could be as simple as providing a "degree" argument, defaulting to 1

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, sounds good.

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: sorry, I just don't like POD6 - that doesn't mean that its bad, or not useful, or not popular - it just means that it's not for me ... it's akin to my dislike of Java ... in the case of POD6 the feeling comes from the idea that with MD you can do 80% if what POD can do - but I can do that in GitHub, in Bear, in PYNBs ... and MD is already my word processor of choice, for example I write business plans,

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> action trackers and so on in it all the time

[17:15] *** soverysour left
[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so maybe I'm a one off, or maybe there's a set of raku newbies who like the idea of embedding docs in code in literate programming style but who would like to use MD rather than learn POD ... if so, then a POD directive such as =begin md / =end md (that maybe turns on MD to POD conversion) would be appreciated

[19:53] <tbrowder> librasteve: good idea. you should ensure pod6.2 has something like that, and antononcube’s Markdown::Grammar could probably deal with it. i have never liked markdown, nor did i like perl pod particularly. but i do love github’s markdown rendering.
