[12:00] <ab5tract> El_Che: I also prefer a Raku-specific Comma IDE. The reason it is not revived is because the support for it is next to zero these days. All documentation has moved away from the ultra-convoluted build process that building an IntelliJ requires.

[12:01] <ab5tract> I was only able to make any progress on Comma 2.0 by giving up the dream and following the instructions for building a plugin

[13:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @El_Che “[…] VS code is not for me” — I completely understand! I do not like VS Code much, but I am “forced” to use with Jupyter notebooks. So far, VS Code is better for me than other Jupyter notebook “hosts.”

[13:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, I use VS Codium, not VS Code. The former is “free” from MicroSofts telemetry.

[13:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Trying the Comma-2.0 REPL within 30 min…

[13:17] <ab5tract> antononcube: nice! looking forward to hearing how it goes

[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract At this point, is there any benefit from compiling / building the plugin from a clone of your repository (and then installing it)? The last few times I just downloaded and installed the release.

[13:20] <ab5tract> sometimes there is a bit of extra development available on `main`, but usually I'm going stuff in a branch and merging before pushing a new beta

[13:21] <ab5tract> in other words, not really :)

[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, good to know.

[13:22] <ab5tract> I'll let you know if there's something worth checkout out on a branch, like if I have something Jupyter related going on

[13:26] <SmokeMachine> timo: no comments didn't help... even for a file as small as this one, the difference is huge...

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Related to your Jupyter comment -- I am actually curious does the installation of the comma plugin (or similar plugins) affect the code cells in Markdown.

[13:27] <timo> that is rough

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ... in Markdown files in IntelliJ.

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I noticed that with the old CommaIDE for the Markdown code fences I have to use "perl6" in order to get code highlighting. With new IntelliJ-and-comma-2.0 I have to use "raku".

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, IntelliJ's Markdown plugin knows "raku", but I doubt it. (It should be a functionality added by the plugin.)

[13:31] <[Coke]> timo (valgrind) it only ever happened once, I couldn't duplicate it

[14:15] <ab5tract> antononcube: that makes sense, because I removed all references to perl6

[14:16] <ab5tract> I assume that the IntelliJ markdown support dispatches to any highlighter registered for that name

[14:17] <ab5tract> “That name” meaning the language you have attached to the markdown code block

[14:22] *** ky1 left

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Great, thanks!

[14:32] *** ky1 left
[14:33] <SmokeMachine> I have a question about ASTQuery. Currently, if I have `node1 node2` it means node2 is a descendant of node1. If I have `node1 > node2` it means node2 is a direct child of node1. And if I have `node1 >> node2` it means node2 is descendant of node1 but there are only nodes from group `ignorable` (RakuAST::Block, RakuAST::Blockoid, RakuAST::StatementList, RakuAST::Statement::Expression, or RakuAST::ArgList) between them. But I'm not 

[14:33] <SmokeMachine> sure that makes much sense... I'm thinking on changing it to "  " be  child, ">" be descedable with only ignorable and ">>" decendable. Would that make more sense?

[14:33] *** ky1 joined
[14:34] <SmokeMachine> and we also have "<" for parent and "<<" for ascendant... with no ascendant with only ignorable for now...

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo "would be neat if someone were to build a tree-sitter grammar for raku, [...]" -- I am interested in implementing the Tree-Sitter's query DSL (based on S-expressions) in Raku.

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That, of course, is a (much) smaller task.

[14:43] *** ky1 left
[14:43] *** ky1 joined
[14:48] <timo> true

[14:52] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: it makes sense to me that you would have a mode that is only ignorable and one that is universal

[14:52] <ab5tract> but maybe it's an alternative option to have `>+` be the universal one

[14:52] <ab5tract> so it would be `>`, `>>`, or `>+` (or maybe `>>+`?)

[14:53] <SmokeMachine> so, no "  "?

[14:53] *** ky1 left
[14:53] *** ky1 joined
[14:53] <ab5tract> yeah, if only to keep all the descendant syntax together

[14:55] <SmokeMachine> so, your suggestion is this? `>` child; `>>` descendant with only ignorable; `>>>` or `>>+` to descendant?

[14:56] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: ☝️

[14:56] <ab5tract> yeah, or some variation of the above

[14:56] <SmokeMachine> I like that...

[14:56] <ab5tract> but that sounds about right to me

[14:57] <ab5tract> keep the space for something special :)

[14:58] <SmokeMachine> I was planing using `+` to a node1 followed by a sibling `node2`... maybe I should use " " for that...

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> An S-expressions DSL can / should be used in ASTQuery.

[15:01] <SmokeMachine> why S-expressions would be better than what we are doing?

[15:03] <SmokeMachine> (just pointing out that I also plan to accept `{ code }` that will receive the match as $/ and the current node... and it should return True or false...)

[15:03] *** ky1 left
[15:03] *** ky1 joined
[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interoperability with Tree-Sitter designs and implementations. Especially, if someone decides to make Tree-Sitter implementation for Raku "knowing" (being able to parse and generate) the S-expressions queries would be useful.

[15:12] *** ky1 left
[15:13] *** ky1 joined
[15:22] <SmokeMachine> antononcude: I don't think S-expression would be very useful for RakuAST... It has too many internal nodes... (but I could be wrong)

[15:22] *** ky1 left
[15:23] *** ky1 joined
[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Which one?

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract It looks in the Raku REPL if I copy and paste code a few code lines (i.e. code separated with new line) the pasted code is not evaluated.

[15:30] <ab5tract> you have to manually evaluate all input

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I.e. REPL evaluates "one liners."

[15:30] <ab5tract> my experience is that I need to cmd + enter

[15:30] <ab5tract> single line or no

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I "evaluated" manually with Cmd-Enter,  but the actual evaluation did not happen.

[15:31] <ab5tract> ah, ok, I will take a look

[15:33] *** ky1 left
[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The Comma Raku REPL is nice, but not crucial (for me.) I kind of "forget" about it. But few years ago I was using it much more frequently.

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> @ab5tract Great! Testing it out... In version 23, multiline input gets ignored (as already reported), one liners seem OK. Version 24 doesn't work for me. It starts, but cannot process even a simple definition like my $a = 42.

[19:13] *** ky1 left
[19:13] *** ky1 joined
[19:16] <ab5tract> Are you using it in a project that has Raku files in it?

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> yes, a simple script

[19:16] <ab5tract> Ok, will look into it

[19:18] <ab5tract> If the script doesn’t have a .raku / .p6 / .pl6 extension of a shebang with ‘raku’ in it on the first line, it won’t register as a project containing Raku files

[19:19] <ab5tract> s/of/or/

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> there's a single file without extension, but with a shebang #!/usr/bin/env raku and an autogenerated META6.json (as the IDE suggested). The script runs just fine through a simple raku run configuration.

[19:22] <ab5tract> I’ll definitely add something to the action that alerts if things like SDK settings haven’t been loaded

[19:22] *** ky1 left
[19:23] *** ky1 joined
[19:24] <ab5tract> c.a53: got it, thanks. Beta 24 includes some fresh logic to avoid needing a META6.json for a script. Sounds like it needs some ironing out.

[19:25] <timo> there's a fun thing that python has where you can embed the stuff that would usually go into your setup.py or pyproject.toml or whatever can go directly into the script, so you can have your entire thing distributed as a single plain text file that can be installed, i.e. dependencies installed properly

[19:26] <ab5tract> Thar would be awesome indeed

[19:28] <ab5tract> c.a53: if you have the time to check, I’m curious whether the repl works if you remove that meta6.json and re-open the project

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> it didn't help

[19:31] <ab5tract> Ok, I’ll look into it. Thanks for raising.

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> most things written in (even many random sequences of letters and numbers) just output nothing after Ctrl+Enter

[19:32] *** ky1 left
[19:32] <ab5tract> It worked on my end or I would not have shipped it

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <c.a53> syntax highliting and suggestions work, but that's about it

[19:33] <ab5tract> I suggest just using beta 23 for now

[19:33] *** ky1 joined

[21:13] <SmokeMachine> does anyone have any idea/suggestion for ASTQuery (https://github.com/FCO/ASTQuery)? I'm planing to release it next week (probably) even not being even close to complete to let other people test and play with it...

[21:14] <SmokeMachine> I'm now thinking on how to make the list of groups customisable... and I would like know you people's opinion on what should be the default groups...

[21:34] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: I'll try to give it a few hours in the next few days but might not be able to do anything until next week

[21:34] <ab5tract> as in a week from tomorrow

[21:34] <ab5tract> but I can definitely see it coming in handy a lot once I get back to actually using Comma instead of developing it :)

[22:00] <ab5tract> Thanks for creating this!

[22:01] <ab5tract> My one thought is whether it might make sense to name it AST::Query, but that’s really a personal stylistic choice for you to make
