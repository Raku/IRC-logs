[16:16] <noob123> I am having trouble installing zef from source.  I type raku -I. bin/zef install .    per the instructions on the zef site.  I get an error message of "No such method 'remove-artifacts' for invocant of type

[16:16] <noob123> 'CompUnit::Repository::Staging'".  How do I resolve this?

[16:16] <noob123> (this is on ubuntu 22 running on WSL on windows 11)

[16:18] <ugexe> what version of raku are you using? raku -v

[16:18] <noob123> Welcome to Rakudo™ v2022.02.

[16:18] <noob123> Implementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d.

[16:18] <noob123> Built on MoarVM version 2022.02.

[16:18] <noob123> as installed by apt install raku

[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for what it's worth, apt sources are not really kept up to date

[16:21] <noob123> ok - so, it sounds like I should avoid the apt version and install per the instructions on raku.org ?

[16:22] <ugexe> ideally yeah. alternative I suspect you could install zef v0.19.1 and it would work

[16:23] <noob123> any opinions regarding the use of rakubrew ?

[16:23] <noob123> worth learning for a noob?

[16:24] <ugexe> personally i would recommend it to anyone wanting to use raku

[16:25] <noob123> ok thanks !

[16:29] <noob123> wow - using rakubrew was actually easy and zef works like a champ!

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> rakubrew is probably the best way on Linux

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> haven't really seen it working on Windows unfortunately

[16:33] <noob123> Seemed to install fine under powershell but unable to install linenoise because it apparently needs a C compiler.

[16:34] <noob123> aka dependency on nmake

[16:36] <noob123> Still, I appreciate y'all help.  Thanks!

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I tried under batch and powershell alike on many different machines with no success...

[18:03] <noob123> @nemokosch interesting. On my Windows 11 pro using powershell 7.3.6 (slightly out of date), I am able to rakubrew mode shim; rakubrew download; and then raku -v  shows v2023.12 and both raku and zef seem to work.  As in, the help pages display.   Is there some additional aspect for which I should be on the lookout?

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know, I'm happy if it works for you. I tried it on different Windows 10 machines and it always failed the way it is described in one of the GH issues

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also it insisted that I'm in batch even when I was in Powershell
