[11:51] <tbrowder> lizmat: i see there is a capability to install a free version of the Jetpack markdown editor as a plugin on a Wordpress site.

[11:51] <lizmat> interesting!

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have been avoding Jetpack -- maybe I should try it.

[11:53] <tbrowder> crud, never mind, that's with wordengine

[11:53] <lizmat> ah, too bad

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat My latest draft edition has absolute links to GitHub images. I plan replace them with corresponding images uploaded to WordPress/RakuAdvent.

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume the latter is preferred.

[13:21] <tbrowder> hm, but cannot a user just upload html? isn't that the native language?

[13:24] <lizmat> there's a block type that allows HTML afaik, but that's *not* the native language in WP afaik

[13:27] <tbrowder> ah, once again i see the wp rest api. i think that might be the ticket. i could support a raku person's project to do that. maybe a paid project by raku foundation

[13:46] <xinming> Is it possible to get the dir of with %?RESOURCES ?

[13:46] <xinming> Just tried with  my $dir = %?RESOURCES<template>; "$dir".IO.slurp;    It seems that $dir will be stringified to Any

[13:47] <xinming> but with %?RESOURCES<template/overview.html>   It worked

[13:47] <xinming> hmm,    my $dir = %?RESOURCES<template>;  (dir "$dir").raku.say;  doesn't show anything

[13:48] <lizmat> xinming: %?RESOURCES are not necessarily limited to file systems

[13:49] <lizmat> the default implementation is, but it is foreseeable that a resource could be fetched remotely

[13:49] <lizmat> ugexe knows more about that :-)

[13:50] <xinming> hmm, got it, so %?RESOURCES<template> doesn't points to filesystem by default, So I think I need to make file list before hand then.

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I write my WordPress blogs in Markdown. I copy the rendered Markdown into the "visual" WordPress editor.

[13:51] <lizmat> fwiw, that's also the approach I take

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This produces fairly good results often. But the question how do you render the Markdown files.

[13:52] <lizmat> if I get a markdown gist, go to gist.github.com, paste the markdown, set the filename with an .md extension, and look at Preview

[13:52] <lizmat> and copy from there

[13:53] <lizmat> and do some copy-editing after pasting in WP

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I used IntelliJ for awhile, but with the newest IntelliJ versions the pasted-into-WordPress Markdown takes too much tweaking. On macOS the app OneMarkdown currently produces good results.

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Preview on GitHub? (I.e. via a web browser.)

[13:54] <lizmat> yeah, while editing a gist, you have a Preview button

[13:54] <lizmat> you don't actually need to create the gist  :-)

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Have seem/tried that.

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Before, I was converting Markdown files with pandoc into HTML. But latest pandoc versions do follow the paragraph conventions of Markdown (when translating to HTML.)

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hence (of course!) I use a Raku package to convert Markdown to HTML.

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was considering using "Markdown::Grammar" for the conversions for my first Raku advent post. (I used IntelliJ first, and after proofreading I used OneMarkdown.)

[16:00] <tbrowder>  xinming: the "key" is for precompiled stuff you need the exact path to a file as a key to that hash.

[19:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e20597: OUTPUT: «(1 => a 2 => b)␤»

[19:49] <xinming> got it, thanks. Yea, I do remember there is a method for this, Just forgot

[19:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e20597: OUTPUT: «{1 => a, 2 => b}␤»

[19:49] <librasteve_> can do this if you want a Hash back

[19:50] <librasteve_> yeah - I try to do these examples to keep my memory going

[19:56] *** gfldex left
[19:58] <xinming> librasteve_: Yea, raku is really a *huge* language.

[19:58] <xinming> I'll be curious how many people in the future will learn all things of the language.

[19:59] <xinming> probably AGI with GPT will learn the whole language.

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> actually I "remembered" invert using ChatGPT - I literally posted in your question --- I do think that the nature of coding is changing with LLMs ... but imo most of the ideas like copilot are wrongheaded since they take you out of the flow ... but ChatGPT is a very very good way to search "documentation" and or to get a good starter skeleton to work off

[20:04] <xinming> Ok, thanks. here in China, We can't use GPT

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .oO

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but learning raku is not as hard as learning the alphabet!

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @xinming Can you use LLaMA?

[20:38] <xinming> antononcube: Not sure, Just heard GPT.
