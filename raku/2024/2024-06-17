[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> So, I've never tried to create an interator, but in my head I'm thinking it's implimented as a closure and each time it's called it returns the next value. Am I close?

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> It there a good example somewhere?

[18:25] <ugexe> https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterator ?

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Oh. Didn't occur to me that it was a type for some reason.

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> thanks
