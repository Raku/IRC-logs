[18:52] <holyghost> Hi, I started on a D&D : Eye of the beholder game written in Raku, I just uploaded the first version (0.1.1), see for EyeofTheBeholder in zef

[18:52] <holyghost> It's just a start for now

[18:57] <holyghost> It's abandonware from 1991 except for the GBA version

[18:57] <holyghost> Most likely I am just going to program the system, not the graphics fully

[18:57] <holyghost> But there's room for that in other programs

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> holyghost: ++

[19:11] <lizmat> I'm afraid this is again vaporware

[19:12] <lizmat> :-(

[19:20] <tbrowder> m: sub f(:a(:$b) = 1) { say $a; say $b }; f

[19:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar f4943c9bf: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Variable '$a' is not declared.  Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this was‚ê§intended to be part of a signature?‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> sub f(:a(:$b) = 1) { say ‚èè$a; say $b }; f‚ê§¬ª

[19:23] <tbrowder> hm, it looks like defining an alias named arg negates being able to assign a default value. tell me that isn't true üò≠

[19:25] <tbrowder> if it's possible i know lizmat can demo it üòÑ

[19:26] <lizmat> m: sub f(:a(:$b) = 1) { say $b }; f

[19:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f4943c9bf: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[19:27] <lizmat> $a doesn't exist within the scope of the sub, it can just be used as a named argument

[19:27] <lizmat> m: sub f(:a(:$b) = 1) { say $b }; f :a<foo>

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar f4943c9bf: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[19:27] <tbrowder> docs don't say explicitly, but i don't see an example, either

[19:27] <lizmat> m: sub f(:a(:$b) = 1) { say $b }; f :b<foo>

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar f4943c9bf: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[19:28] <lizmat> :a(:$b) syntax means: allow both "a" and "b" as named argument, but store the result from either in $b

[19:30] <tbrowder> oh, i see, thanks! that's fine since it doesn't affect the caller

[19:30] <lizmat> indeed :-)

[19:32] <tbrowder> i think docs do mention that way before the description--there's a lot of raku prose in that area

[20:46] <Manifest0> lizmat, just a heads up, I opened a ticket against DBIish: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish/issues/236
