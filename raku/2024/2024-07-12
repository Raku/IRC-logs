[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> For those who use ci.sparrowhub.io , I am going to deprecate current yaml dsl in favor of pure Raku and migrate the whole system to sparky , eventually I am going to migrate all active projects to it, nothing will change for end users besides pipelines will be managed from centralized repositories via MRs . The reason is yamlish approach does not give any benefits and there is no need to use one more layer of

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> abstraction, pure Raku should be just, also I would like to give sparky more exposure instead of hiding it under current ci system , any thoughts, objections, suggestions , feel free to post here or on ci.sparrowhub.io gh repo

[09:26] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Some typos: pure Raku should be just fine.  Will be managed from centralized repository ( singular form )

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Less YAML, more Raku -- got it.

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yup

[09:59] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> My original intent was to expand the system for none Raku users however after  few years of it‚Äôs existence I don‚Äôt see any potential for that, so let it be just Raku , üòä

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Also sparky has grown a lot since then and gained a lot of interesting features to be available and tried out in public

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Like running builds manually with customized parameters and string job results via artifacts

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Storing

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I'm getting a VMNull error with a somewhat convoluted sub x { for @a { for @b { return $_ with f($_) } } } but I can't golf it down :(

[12:25] <lizmat> vendethiel is that on HEAD ?   or on 2024.06 ?

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I'm rebuilding a new one from HEAD

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> still getting the same error

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> The module is public, so I can just commit the broken version if someone wants to take a look

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> return $_ with f("$_...") gives me the error, but my $dir = "$_..."; return $_ with f($dir); doesn't

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> the {} are apparently a no-go, I know it's a new block but the VMNull is still surprising.

[12:35] <lizmat> looks like it is fixed in RakuAST

[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> feels funny to close a decade-old issue

[13:11] <lizmat> vendethiel how did you determine it was a decade old issue ?

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> ah no, sorry, I meant the issue I was working on when I encountered the bug

[13:15] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> FWIW the bug was here: https://github.com/vendethiel/Sprockets.pl/blob/master/lib/Sprockets/Locator.rakumod#L37. Changing $dir.IO to "{.&rm-trail}$(rm-trail $prefix)/".IO (note {}, not $().) errors with No such method 'dispatch:<var>' for invocant of type 'VMNull'

[13:19] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I'm very happy the RakuAST grant got approved

[13:21] * lizmat as well  :-)

[13:21] <lizmat> looking forward to nine finding the time to pick it up again

[13:37] <[Coke]> is there a blog post?

[13:40] <jdv> there was a post by tprf about approved grants a few weeks ago iirc

[13:45] <[Coke]> I only saw the ask, not the approval. weird.

[13:46] <[Coke]> oh, it's a month old: https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/jun24-grants-and-vote-results

[13:46] <[Coke]> Thanks!

[13:55] * lizmat notices [Coke] doesn't read the weekly every week  :-)

[13:56] <jdv> that's how i found out

[17:52] <cioran> o/

[17:52] <cioran> hey just heard about this

[17:54] <cioran> Raku have a preferred GUI toolkit you folks use to build out a GUI?

[17:59] <lizmat> something like https://raku.land/zef:japhb/Terminal::Widgets ?

[18:00] <[Coke]> I am guessing that's more TUI than GUI

[18:04] <cioran> TUI?

[18:05] <lizmat> on #raku-beginner the question was about a front-end for a CLI, so that's why I suggested Terminal::Widgets

[18:07] <[Coke]> text user interface

[18:07] <[Coke]> I've used japhb's stuff to make a command line app that draws in a shell for some lo res gaming stuff which was nice.

[18:10] <patrickb> there is GTk::simple and at least two large scale wip GTK projects (Xliff and martimm are the authors).

[18:11] <[Coke]> several folks in #mugs for the text-based stuff.

[18:13] <patrickb> Oh, there is Gnome::GTK3 (that's martimm, I guess it's not WIP anymore)

[18:13] <cioran> Cool I will go there, apologies if this is the wrong place to discuss

[18:14] <cioran> Oh, no it's not gaming

[18:21] <patrickb> This is the right place!

[18:21] <patrickb> Just if it's specific to Terminal::Widgets, then mugs is right-er ;-)

[18:29] <[Coke]> yup, no worries.

[18:29] <cioran> IS raku backwards compatible with perl?

[18:33] <lizmat> no

[18:34] <cioran> Oh :(

[18:35] *** Woodi left
[18:36] <cioran> Nevermind I think I got it sorted, doing tk w/perl thx guys

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @cioran There is "Inline::Perl5", that might work for you.

[18:39] <cioran> Nah I gotta use perl and I think tk, but oddly an acquaintance of mine might be really into this MUGs which is his sorts of thing

[18:39] <cioran> I appreciate all the help folks :)

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good luck!
