[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lucs: rakudoc default seems to take the pod6 from the installed lib file, so Some::Module would be /lib/Some/Module.rakumod according to your META6 and installed at eg # Doc ~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.07/share/perl6/site HTML::Functional

[10:40] <jaguart> having trouble with ``zef install --/test cro`` - staging JSON::JWT fails unable to find JSON::Fast - but ``zef list --installed`` shows JSON::Fast installed in home.raku?

[11:03] <jaguart> ok - found that ``zef install --install-to=home --/test cro`` works. FWIW the failure message shows uable to find JSON::Fast in site, vendor, core, an AbsolutePath, NQP and Perl5 - interestingly HOME repo is not present. $*REPO looks like it points to /tmp/.zef...

[11:27] <m6locks> I'm getting zef error [Inline::Perl5] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl: No such file or directory although libperl5.34 is already the newest version (5.34.0-3ubuntu1.3). is there some other package I need to have installed?

[11:30] <jaguart> @m6locks ``ld cannot find -lperl`` usually means you need the dev/headers e.g. on Debian you probably need ``sudo apt install libperl-dev``

[11:31] <m6locks> aye ok, installing

[11:31] <m6locks> thanks

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m6locks: if you are on a mac, then darwin or homebrew perl or maybe worth a look

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ** Do not use the system Perl on MacOS. That is for Apple, not for you. **

[13:32] <jaguart> Reading about Cro Templates - https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template-modules - is anyone working on any Cro template dists? I don't see any published in raku.land...

[13:33] <jaguart> or pointers to using other templating with Cro... e.g. anything handle-bar like?

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jaguart Well, @librasteve is (or was) impressed by Cro-templating, so he might have related work plans.

[13:34] *** jaguart left
[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jaguart: & @antononcube 'tis true I'm working on Cro stuff (also Xliff was looking at similar?)

[13:38] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to jaguart

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jaguart: I have done about 41/2 of the 25 examples with https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples ... so far I have pretty much standardized on picocss as the CSS and so there is some prior art to build on (not much) - if you like the look of pico (I guess they use their stuff on their website, me I like their general design touch and their dark mode chops), then it would be fairly easy for me to extract and publish as a crotmp

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> template module ... say Cro::Templates::Pico and we could collaborate on that ...

[13:43] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to jaguart

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the non-Cro template side, I think that it would be fairly straightforward to make a TT2 or Mustache (or whatever) by resuscitating eg  https://raku.land/?q=Template%3A%3AMustache and then bolting into your Cro Routes.rakumod like this https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/blob/ad8064a02152b6f54bbc3387f330a534a5d81596/lib/Routes.pm6#L79 example that uses Text::Markdown

[13:52] <[Coke]> I've been very happy with rakubrew once the mac silicon issue got sorted.

[13:53] <[Coke]> I use it to update every month now. My only minor annoyance is having to reinstall zef modules (each verison has its own zef install dir, I think) - but this is not a huge deal (and I for things with command line tools that I use, I have a wrapper that does the zef install if the thing is missing)

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart.v1> @librasteve - interesting - thank you ðŸ™‚

[17:10] <ugexe> you can also do `zef install -` to pass in depends on STDIN instead of using e.g. xargs like that

[17:21] <ugexe> also see the example here for how it could theoretically be even cleaner: https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/80

[18:17] <tonyo> two more items to do on the raku ecosystem grant and we should be able to open it up -

[18:17] <tonyo> and then i can get back to addressing fez bugs/features

[18:29] <[Coke]> tonyo++

[18:29] <Xliff> \o

[18:29] <Xliff> How hard would it be to add a single argument to the repl() command, which is a string that gets printed right after the REPL is started?

[18:30] <Xliff> This would greatly help when using it as a debugging tool so you know where in your code the REPL is starting from.

[18:30] <Xliff> (I just started using this, today)

[18:34] <[Coke]> what would the advantage be over "say 'HERE'; repl" ?

[18:36] <Xliff> Not having to type "say 'HERE'; repl". Instead it would be "repl('HERE')". It adds up.

[18:49] <tonyo> you could just wrap repl

[19:04] <ab5tract> Xliff: if you prepared an PR with this feature, I wouldn't expect strong opposition

[19:25] <Xliff> ab5tract: Well, I wouldn't mind! Hence my original question.

[19:27] <ab5tract> How would anyone who hasn't implemented it know how hard it is?

[19:27] <ab5tract> :)

[19:28] <ab5tract> Which is why I'm encouraging you to put an implementation together

[19:29] <Xliff> LOL. Done.
