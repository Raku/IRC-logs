[03:02] <Xliff> Heya, phogg! How are you?

[03:12] <kjp> please do give it your support                                                             │ dg │02:49:57           lizmat | https://n.tell antononcube As the author of various Geo:: modules, including the Well Known Text module, I use publically available data for generating topograhic maps of areas I'm interested in. (Hence the port of Geo::Coordinates::UTM from Perl to Raku.)

[03:12] <kjp> Where did that rubbish come from; sorry.

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks to everyone who answered my "what are your Geo interests?" question!

[14:14] <tellable6> hey antononcube, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/6c3d00f5052fad1500afb3f5b0f0d07d

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I made the data package "Data::Geographics"  that has population, coordinates, and elevation data for the cities of 9 countries and country data for nearly 20 countries. I will add geometric shapes soon.

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is another package "DSL::Entity::Geographics" that can be used to do Named Entity Recognition (NER) of Geo-locations: countries, regions, and cities. I have to refactor it to have less data and used the data in "Data::Geographics".

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again on "Data::Geographics" -- it is faily big (≈10MB). Adding geomatric shapes data to it might make 5-10 times bigger.

[16:09] <Xliff> ^^ SIZE was removed because it is defined in another compunit. Even if the compunit is used, this error will occur.

[16:15] <lizmat> Xliff: is there an issue for this already ?

[16:15] <Xliff> No

[16:15] <Xliff> Just found it

[16:20] <Xliff> lizmat: Do you need me to add it? I'm in the middle of $dayJob

[16:24] <lizmat> well, you're the stakeholder in this  :-)

[16:24] <lizmat> at your convenience  :-)

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kjp Your remark about generating Geo-location maps reminded me that I wanted to include the property "LocationLink" for the city data. That is fairly straightforward, but then I would want to display that image in Jupyter...
