[02:39] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I’ve been playing with the idea of html slang/dsl for Raku for some time now (it’s more related to components, but it involves html). I’m not sure if it could help showing some options, but if you’d like to see some experiments: https://github.com/FCO/p6-react https://github.com/FCO/proact/blob/master/t/01-slang.t https://github.com/FCO/MemoizedDOM/blob/master/examples/todo/Todo.pm6

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: yes I think you are already ahead of my thinking in the same general direction - however, I have some "wilder" concepts that I would like to bring to the party. I have a couple of questions for you that I will post at a new HTML::Components issue and maybe I will start a new repo that I will call HTML::Islands for now that (my guess is) could have HTML::Components as attributes. So we can try to

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> partition and reuse stuff... I genuinely feel that I am scratching the surface and that this will need some collaboration work to get to the "best" solution...

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve  Can your metrics framework be used for matrices? See this HackerNews comment here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42204046

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think it should be pretty doable...

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag of the day

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag '$v^=^([1,2,3],"m/s"); $m=4kg; $p^=$m*$v^; say "p^=$p^"'

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so this $v^=^([1,2,3],"m/s") is a velocity 3-vector

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (raku App::Crag is a CLI calculator that uses Physics::Measure and Math::Vector)

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my current idea is that DataFrames are the best vehicle for typing of columns (ie not Math::Matrices) and I have in mind an improvement to the Dan library that can take a Physics::Measure type as a column type (as well as more basic types currently supported)

[16:55] <lizmat> librasteve perhaps https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Prompt could be of interest for App::Crag ?

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Physics::Measure::Mass, Physics::Measure::Speed and so on

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have mentioned this before: "Math::Matrix" is a heavy package, so, I use it, but not very aggressively. Snd it needs re-adoption. (As far as I can tell.)

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> switches to IRCCloud

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Maybe "Commands" too, should be interest to "Craig".

[16:57] <lizmat> yeah.. that as well...   :-)

[17:18] <ab5tract> tbrowder: what do you mean by "no executable may be created"?

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> since I mangled my post a bit I will rephrase my answer: Physics::Measure objects have a value, that value may be either a Real or a Math::Vector (actually it has no type constraint, but these are the types I have tested). The App::Crag example shows some Crag syntax ^(1,2,3) shorthand for Math::Vector.new(1,2,3), the p^ syntax makes a unicode combining p and the small arrow above.

[17:22] <tbrowder> should i have been  more restrictive and added caveats? i think this is discussed in the docs somewhere.  i just need some kind succint warning for users of my advent article

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so we already have Math::Vector as value of Physics::Measure, but to go to a matrix, then we need a structure that has typed columns and a Dan DataFrame is the perfect container for that... where each column can have a Physics::Unit type

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I look forward to making Crag work with the repl !

[17:26] <ab5tract> " where each column can have a Physics::Unit type" now this sounds really cool

[18:10] <[Coke]> lizmat: no "de" - only time I've ever seen that word without the de prefix.

[18:10] <lizmat> weird  :-)

[18:12] <[Coke]> tbrowder: raku -e "BEGIN say run('ls')" #this works

[18:12] <[Coke]> what is the actual problem you're trying to warn against?

[18:15] <timo> maybe a warning that if the module the BEGIN is in gets precompiled, then the BEGINned code won't run when it's loaded?

[18:15] <timo> but then that sounds like you just want INIT instead?

[18:16] <ugexe> yeah that just sounds like describing what BEGIN is when using it

[18:16] <[Coke]> ah

[18:21] <timo> but that was just a guess

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Ad hoc matrix-vector Dot product is not that hard to program.

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will see can re-cast your examples with dot-product from "Math::DistanceFunctions".

[18:45] *** apac joined
[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, dot-product is only in "Math::DistanceFunctions::Native". (For now.)
