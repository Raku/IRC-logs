[02:51] <wayland76> Do we have a Wiki where it'd be suitable to put a comparison of eg. DataQueryWorkflows, Dan, DBIish, and TOP?  I'm happy to start it, but would like antononcube and librasteve to also be able to edit.  

[02:55] <[Coke]> I'd make a shared project on github and use that wiki probably

[03:07] <wayland76> Oh, yeah, smart idea.  Thanks! 

[03:09] <wayland76> I can't find the documentation on the .so method.  All I've found so far is a reference on the Signature Literals page.  Any tips?  

[03:26] <wayland76> antononcube, is there a way I'm missing that lets you give hints to the DateTime::Grammar?  ie. locale?  

[03:26] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/routine/so

[03:27] <[Coke]> and that links to other primary sources

[12:33] <wayland> m: use DateTime::Grammar; datetime-interpret("26/01/2001")

[12:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7425592c: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Could not find DateTime::Grammar in:‚ê§    /home/camelia/.raku‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/perl6/site‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/perl6/vendor‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-in‚Ä¶¬ª

[12:34] <wayland> On my local, it says: Month out of range. Is: 26, should be in 1..12

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Does datetime-interpret("26.01.2001")  work?

[12:38] <wayland> Yep :) 

[12:39] <wayland> I figured out I'm trying to match rule date6

[12:40] <wayland> raku -e 'use DateTime::Grammar; say datetime-interpret("26/01/2001", rule => "date6")'

[12:40] <wayland> That line above returns a Nil

[12:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland I was going to write that -- I see token date6  defined for "your" date format, but I guess I have to define an overall regex, not just a token.

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Yeah, the "date6" rule/token is for month names. This should work: raku -e 'use DateTime::Grammar; say datetime-interpret("26/Jan/2001", rule => "date6")'

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland I guess I have to define a new rule ("just for you.")

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, for all the people using your date format spec. üôÇ

[12:55] <wayland> Yeah, it's an Australian thing, I think.  

[12:59] *** jpn joined
[13:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To be honest, working with dates- and date-time formats is both difficult and boring. It seems for your date format there should be a locale parameter handed to the grammar.

[13:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Which means (other) locale specs have to be respected.

[13:01] <wayland> Sure.  If you don't get to it any time soon, that's fine.  

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üëç

[13:03] <wayland> (I threw together a quick Grammar just to handle my specific case :) )

[13:04] <wayland> I had a look at /usr/lib/locale/en_AU.utf8/LC_TIME and I can see it probably has the relevant info, but probably not in a useful format

[13:05] <wayland> (it's binary)

[13:05] *** jpn left
[13:08] <wayland> Yeah, it looks like we need something that calls the C function "localeconv", and returns the struct in "man 7 locale".  Unless that's already happening somewhere that I've missed.  

[13:09] <wayland> (For the record, I think a more useful name than "date6" would be "dmy-string", meaning that it's in DMY order, and that the month is a String instead of numeric)

[13:13] <wayland> Anyway, I've successfully made my Raku program go "Segmentation fault (core dumped)", so it's time to go to bed :)

[13:13] <wayland> m: use Cairo; my $surface = Cairo::Surface::PDF.new(filename => "file.pdf", :width(1683e0), :height(2383e0)); $surface.show_page()

[13:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7425592c: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Could not find Cairo in:‚ê§    /home/camelia/.raku‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/perl6/site‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/perl6/vendor‚ê§    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/share/p‚Ä¶¬ª

[13:14] <wayland> That's the one that core dumps on my local

[13:14] <wayland> I'll try to put a bug report in tomorrow.  

[13:32] *** teatime left
[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Yeah, the "dmy-date" rule/tokne can be implemented without being attempted by default. I.e. using it via datetime-interpret("26/2/2001", rule => "dmy-date")'.

[18:15] <tbrowder> hi, i'm looking again at maybe using MAIN for arg handling. my main problem with it is no apparent way to control the output arg and descrip widths in a terminal. i have suggested allowing options to allow arg and descrip line wrapping but got shot down.

[18:17] <tbrowder> is there any "easy" way to hook into the output to handle it downstream?

[18:21] <tbrowder> ah, i think lizmat's App::Rak has a solution...

[18:22] <lizmat> App::Rak doesn't know about terminal widths

[18:27] *** jpn left
[18:30] <tbrowder> but the output seems to be a comfy width

[18:32] <tbrowder> if MAIN could recognize a \n inside a #= comment that would be a start

[18:33] <lizmat> It does with RakuAST

[18:33] <lizmat> it's just that MAIN processing doesn't use that afaik

[18:34] <tbrowder> cool! i need to try getting that version working

[18:37] <tbrowder> ...and not expect MAIN to be changed...
