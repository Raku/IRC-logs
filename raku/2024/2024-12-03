[02:12] <Xliff> Is there a shorter way to do this:  if $v > 0 ?? $p !! $n -> $r { return $r; } # ?

[02:15] <Xliff> m: my ($v, $n, $p) = (1, 2, 3); say $_ with $v > 0 ?? $n !! $p'

[02:16] <Xliff> So what is the penalty for this code? I suspect the full if statement is faster, but is there a significant penalty hit using with?

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see the ‚ÄúBauble Up‚Äù section in the new Advent post to be empty.

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, it is an issue with Safari, but, well, please check.

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah ‚Äî I can see the embedded video in that section with Brave.

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Yes, the post is ready. Can you see the draft?

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will schedule it. (I thought you do the scheduling.)

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I see you did that ‚Äî thanks!

[13:14] <timo> i wish code wouldn't need to scroll horizontally on the advent calendar posts :|

[13:14] <lizmat> yw, and a nice post yet again  :-)

[13:14] <lizmat> timo: which post ?

[13:17] <lizmat> I try to make sure code doesn't scroll horizontally, if at all possible

[13:21] <timo> i see it in the HTMX one

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ha! I have to make my code scroll horizontally often in WordPress. Otherwise WP‚Äôs narrow post window/canvas would make some of my posts unreadable. (To me at least).

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The latest one I published is a good example. I want the posts to contain all the data and code it discusses and because of that I included African countries coordinates. If it wasn‚Äôt for code-scrolling that would make the post hard to read.

[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In all fairness, I prefer how planet.raku.org renders my WP posts. üôÇ

[13:42] <lizmat> timo: looks like that one is unfixable  :-(

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I plan to make a Wolfram Language (Wl) (aka Mathematica) post that mirrors my first Raku Advent post.

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I interested comparing Raku and WL in that way. WL has a paclet with a chess-engine -- not easy to do in any language.

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Anyway, people should not get confused between those two posts.

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The moderators of community.wolfram.com no longer allow me to publish Raku-language notebooks there. So, sometimes I convert Raku-centric notebooks into WL-centric ones in order to get the content/message published.

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: tbh I think that the post is more readable when the svg lines are mainly off the page to the right (since that is just coordinates and so on) - I take your feedback and will try to do better

[17:33] <xinming> m: multi t ("a") { callwith("a-next") }; multi t ("b") { callwith("b-next") }; multi t ($d) { $d.say; }; t(<a>)

[17:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: ¬´Too few positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 0‚ê§  in sub t at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in sub t at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[17:34] <xinming> With this example, when I use callwith to samewith, it'll work. What I'm curious, is it because, that there is a "chain" to use internanly for callwith

[17:34] <xinming> but with samewith,  a new fresh call chain will be built?

[17:35] <xinming> I read the doc, But I feel these subs are a bit confusing to me. Is there better way to memorize this?

[17:45] <[Coke]> I have an TOP grammar regex that is a bunch of LTM choices, repeated ( <A> | <B> | <C>)* - In the actions, how can I get the made values of all the <C>s in the top rule? if I reference it, I am getting Nil back (despite hitting the happy path in the action on a C which is then calling "make")

[17:46] <lizmat> shouldn't you get that from grammar.parse ?

[17:51] <[Coke]> if I have an empty top action, I get an Any back.

[17:51] <[Coke]> I'm trying to make something in the TOP to return it for parse. if I 'make 3', that comes back from parse.

[17:51] <ky> how can i get a list of matches for a regex in a given string?

[17:51] <ky> rather than just one match

[17:52] <[Coke]> m: "this and that" ~~ m:g/ 'a'/

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: ( no output )

[17:52] <[Coke]> m: dd "this and that" ~~ m:g/ 'a'/

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: ¬´(Match.new(:orig("this and that"), :from(5), :pos(6)), Match.new(:orig("this and that"), :from(11), :pos(12)))‚ê§¬ª

[17:53] <lizmat> m: .say for "this and that" ~~ m:g/ 'a'/

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The copy and paste is as expected in VSCode. üôÇ

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I wonder to what degree that is comma-plug-in question, though.

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will experiment later tonight and report.
