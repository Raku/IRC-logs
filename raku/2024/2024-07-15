[09:53] <wayland> thowe: Example?  I would've thought that $str1 =~ $str2 would work.  

[09:55] <lizmat> $str1 ~= $str2 you mean?

[09:56] <wayland> Yeah, that's it.  thowe: Use ~=

[09:57] <wayland> m: no strict; $str1 = "aaa"; $str2 = "bbb"; $str1 ~= $str2; say $str1;

[09:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d3723bdd: OUTPUT: «aaabbb␤»

[09:57] <lizmat> note that the "=" in there is a meta-op

[09:59] <lizmat> m: sub infix:<foo>($a, $b) { $a ~ "foo" ~ $b };  my $a = "bar"; $a foo= "bar; say $a

[09:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d3723bdd: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in double quotes; couldn't find final '"' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------>  };  my $a = "bar"; $a foo= "bar; say $a⏏<EOL>␤    expecting …»

[09:59] <lizmat> m: sub infix:<foo>($a, $b) { $a ~ "foo" ~ $b };  my $a = "bar"; $a foo= "bar"; say $a

[09:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d3723bdd: OUTPUT: «barfoobar␤»

[09:59] <lizmat> it even works on custom ops

[15:48] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/07/15/2024-29-intel-exprjit-5/

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> fwiw, the "unreviewed content" warning on reddit can be dodged by using old.reddit.com, but of course it's suboptimal...

[15:56] <jdv> thanks lizmat!

[15:57] <jdv> just recently reddit on mobile thinks the sub is "unsafe".  classic switch to old is easy enuf but really?!

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> it's just their default

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> reddit is awful

[16:01] <jdv> ah, nevermind.  same warning were talkin bout.

[16:02] <lizmat> yeah, would have been surprised if it were that easy to circumvent

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> no, it is that easy to circumvent

[16:02] <jdv> yes, reddit isnt great, but its where many look.  me included.

[16:02] <lizmat> well, you could start looking at https://programming.dev as well

[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> the old. trick works, I just have no clue what kind of process you need to go through to get approved

[16:03] <jdv> yeah:)  i typically hit r/perl, r/rakulang, r/ programming, and r/programmerhumor...

[22:32] <wayland> If I have a series of values of possibly varying types (eg. Int, Str), is there a straightforward way I can get the highest common parent?  eg. in the case of Int and Str, it's "Cool", but in the case of Str and Str, it's "Str".  

[22:32] <wayland> m: my Int $a = 42; my Str $b = "c"; say $a.^parents, $b.^parents;

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «()()␤»

[22:34] *** jpn left
[22:35] <wayland> my Int $a = 42; my Str $b = "c"; say $a.^parents(:all), $b.^parents(:all);

[22:35] <evalable6> wayland, rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «((Cool) (Any) (Mu))((Cool) (Any) (Mu))␤»

[22:38] <wayland> Now I just need a good way to detect the first common element in 2 lists.  But I think I can do that :).
