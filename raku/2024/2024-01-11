[20:53] <tbrowder__> is there an easier way to match any partial leading chars of a target string?

[21:02] <Voldenet> m: for "a", "ab", "ac", "ace", "acer" { say $_ eq "acerbic".substr(0, $_.chars) }'

[21:03] <Voldenet> something like that perhaps

[21:06] <Voldenet> btw, the above regex can be shortened to /^a/

[21:07] <Voldenet> so it might be not what you actually wanted

[21:55] <tbrowder__> correct, i want it for matching option args in a raku prog. allow one or more of the correct order of the leading chars of the option.

[21:56] <tbrowder__> but i'll bet lizmat has a shorter method...

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so the longest valid prefix

[21:59] <tbrowder__> it's a pain to manually chop the word into abbreviation. ah, maybe my Abbreviation module can help!

[22:00] <tbrowder__> Abbreviations

[22:03] <tbrowder__> yes!

[22:04] <tbrowder__> m: use Abbreviations
