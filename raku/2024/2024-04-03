[13:51] <tbrowder> lizmat: you ok? i don't see weekly for this week

[13:52] <lizmat> yeah, I'm ok.. just wondered whether anybody would notice my April Fools prank of not writing a weekly

[13:53] <tbrowder> well you "fool"ed me. we were talking yesterday and we in my small world heard no one mention april fool!

[13:53] <lizmat> or it was that I didn't feel like it  :-(

[13:56] <tbrowder> hope you feel better soon. you need a designated understudy from the younger crowd

[14:13] <[Coke]> :(

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Prank you! Prank you, very much!

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Agh, sorry -- didn't read all the comments! Get better!

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am trying to work out how to dynamically add class names to my exports

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i have this class Length is Measure is export {}

[14:30] <lizmat> the secret lies in having an EXPORT sub in the compunit scope

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i would like this my $item = 'Boodle'; class ::($item) is Measure is export {}

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .oO

[14:31] <lizmat> that will never work

[14:31] <lizmat> as the assignment is runtime, and the class statement is compile time

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ===SORRY!=== Name ::($item) is not compile-time known, and can not serve as a package name 

[14:31] <lizmat> right

[14:33] <lizmat> librasteve your example shows something different from your original question, I believe ?

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah ... so in the Map that EXPORT returns do I just go $item => ::($item) is Measure or similar?

[14:34] <lizmat> the value must be a deconted value that you want to export

[14:35] <lizmat> Map.new( ($item => Measure) )   # note the extra parens to create a list of Pairs instead of named arguments

[14:35] <lizmat> if $item is the name you want to export to

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaay - let me tinker with that ...

[14:40] *** ptc joined
[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not getting anywhere - this is probably one for SO

[14:58] <lizmat> note that the EXPORT sub *must* be at the compunit scope, *not* any classes scope

[15:10] <japhb> Probably worth pointing out that applies to compunit-scoped class declarations (some people use those almost exclusively and may not be thinking about it applying here)

[21:52] <[Coke]> anyone from #raku planning to attend?

[21:54] <[Coke]> I will actually be driving through Vegas on the way home at that time - not in town long enough for the conference, but would be happy to swing by and say "hey"

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I was strongly considering attending, but decided not to. (Too far for me...)

[22:05] <Util> Coke: please do swing by! 

[22:06] <Util> Sarah and I are attending; I don't yet have a handle on other #raku folks.
