[02:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Maybe macbook-air has been in the air too much? (Or about to be in the air for too long...)

[03:03] <kybr> m: $_ = '<h2 id="foo">Foo</h2> <h2 id="bar">Bar</h2>'; for m:g/ '<h2 id=' $<id>=[.*?] '>' $<title>=[.*?] '</h2>' / { say $/<id> }

[03:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar ad0afb047: OUTPUT: ¬´Type List does not support associative indexing.‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[03:03] <kybr> what am i doing wrong here?

[03:04] <kybr> i want to get at the capture named 'id' in the match

[03:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kybr You missed the * -- should be [.*?]  .

[03:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the modified code:  $_ = '<h2 id="foo">Foo</h2> <h2 id="bar">Bar</h2>';  for m:g/ '<h2 id=' $<id>=[.*?] '>' $<title>=[.*?] '</h2>' / { say $/¬ª<id> } 

[03:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Gives:  (ÔΩ¢"foo"ÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢"bar"ÔΩ£) (ÔΩ¢"foo"ÔΩ£ ÔΩ¢"bar"ÔΩ£) 

[03:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kybr Note I replaced $/<id> with $/¬ª<id>.

[03:21] <kybr> thanks. one thing. why does it print a list, twice?

[03:24] <kybr> my understanding is that this code should not give a list in the body of the for loop. this should print "foo" and then "bar"

[03:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, without the :global  option you get that.

[04:04] <kybr> m: $_ = '<h2 id="foo">Foo</h2> <h2 id="bar">Bar</h2>'; for m/ '<h2 id=' <(.*?)> '>' <(.*?)> '</h2>' / { say $/ }

[04:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar ad0afb047: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢FooÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[04:04] <kybr> this match has two captures. why does only the second get captured. shouldn't there be a list?

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am sorry for this ignorant and probably self-answering question: Why a rakudo version released in June indicates in its name to be created in May?

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I am preparing a presentation with/for Raku and LLMs.)

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (So, I want to be precise...)

[14:47] <[Coke]> ... do you mean 2024.05.01 ?

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes.

[14:48] <[Coke]> If so, historically YYYY.MM is the release month; so the point release to fix that one issue on windows is a point release of the May release, not the June release.

[14:48] *** soverysour joined
[14:48] <[Coke]> 2024.06 would imply an entire new release

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Kind of. That package did not seem ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù to me, So, I started implementing wording numbers in ‚ÄúLingua::NumericWordForms‚Äù ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt go far .

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To be clear, ‚ÄúLingua::NumericWordForms‚Äù parses-interprets ‚Äúworded‚Äù numbers from many languages, but generates ‚Äúworded‚Äú numbers only to English and Koremutake. (And Bulgarian, to a point.)

[22:52] <wayland76> Hi all!  Some of you may remember the trouble I was having with Signatures and Parameters which resulted in suggestions that I use RakuAST (which didn't work due to having it's own bugs).  I returned to the non-AST approach, and have now filed a bug report for that too at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5591

[22:56] <wayland76> Another question.  I'm trying to support tables in Raku.  I want something I can use to check if the values passed in for a Tuple/Row are of the correct types.  An associative structure probably won't work well because there are no real type constraints (by name/position) on the associative array.  I was planning to use Captures and Signatures for this (ie. set a signature on the Table, and pass the rows in as Captures).  Is there a different approach I 

[22:56] <wayland76> should be considering?
