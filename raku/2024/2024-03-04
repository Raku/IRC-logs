[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vrurg ‚ö†Ô∏è I am making a video with references to you.

[02:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, some of your GitHub issues.

[02:48] <vrurg> Am I to be scared? ;)

[02:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vrurg Yes! From ü¶ôü¶ô.

[02:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (As in "O'Llama")

[02:50] * guifa keeps reminding himself he needs to convert some of his homework projects into workable Raku solutions

[02:50] <vrurg> :D

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vrurg Basically, I implemented most of the "llama.cpp" or "llamafile"  Web API. Some of the endpoints support "file upload" by serialziation.

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (As expected.)

[02:54] <vrurg> Where is the "like" button when it's so needed?  

[02:55] <vrurg> Though I'm afraid the current task is going to take all my time for a couple of weeks now. :(

[02:55] *** justache joined
[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If you can run "llamafile" models locally on your computer, ''llamafile" models do have a web interface (lauched automatically) with an upload file button.

[02:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sorry -- "upload image" button.

[02:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, this is what my movie is about.

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a screeshot of the interface -- see the buttons at the bottom.

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb I was not aware of "RakudoContainerBuilder" -- most likely I would have used in "LLM::Containerization". https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-LLM-Containerization

[15:36] <patrickb> japhb: I think antoncube's comment was meant to say: "most likely I would have used [the RakudoContainerfileBuilder] in ..." so it wasn't proposing LLM::Containerization as an alternative, but as a potential user.

[15:37] <japhb> Ah, gotcha.

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb Correct.

[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "LLM::Containerization" is just supposed to make it easier to deploy LLM-ready Raku functionalties and corresponding (Cro-) endopoints.

[18:41] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/03/04/2024-10-grammarism/

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It looks like @lizmat reads the content of the articles they link in Rakudo Weekly. ü§î

[18:45] <lizmat> :-)

[18:58] *** sena_kun joined
[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Please, as some point, make "WWW::LLaMA" a new module. (In the Rakudo weekly post.)

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Normally, I won't require that, but I created that module last week mostly (‚âà60%) because of demands by @vrurg, I plan to discuss this in an upcoming blog post and video.

[19:01] <lizmat> oops, missed it being new: fixed

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here are is a trail of @vrurg's demands for ü¶ô support: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-LLM-Functions/issues/1#issuecomment-1971364968

[21:22] <patrickb> japhb: I just remembered the issue of Termios needing a compiler installed. I seem to remember you proposing splitting off a "Termios-lite" only having the values required for Terminal::Print to work which wouldn't need a compiler. Do I remember right? Is it obvious from the Terminal::Print sources which values it needs?

[22:43] <japhb> patrickb: Terminal::Print and Terminal::LineEditor both use it (using similar code, which shouldn't surprise anyone).  Here's the T::LE version: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/blob/main/lib/Terminal/LineEditor/RawTerminalInput.rakumod#L309-L337
