[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jdv I am sorry, I do not understand what to do with the "new REPL"  and "Jupyter::Chatbook" issue you pointed out.

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Am I supposed to install a new version of Raku in order to see that issue on my computer?

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is the same issue present for "Jupyter::Kernel" ?

[17:21] <[Coke]> right

[17:28] <lizmat> perhaps a problem solving issue ?

[17:29] <finanalyst> [Coke] Have you a couple of minutes?

[17:33] <finanalyst> I'm starting work on a 'secondaries' plugin. Currently the website generates 1400 extra files. Most of them only repeat a little section from one file, based on data in `=head`. I am thinking that a secondary should only be generated if there are two or more sections, references to two or more primary files. In addition, we can create a 'must-do'

[17:33] <finanalyst> list based on existing external references to some secondary file

[17:36] <[Coke]> The reason to keep the page even if only 1 is to allow for easier to generate deep links

[17:36] <[Coke]> like https://docs.raku.org/routine/run

[17:39] *** zenmov left
[17:40] <finanalyst> so you see benefit in generating so many pages. It's easier to handle, I was trying to reduce file numbers

[17:43] *** zenmov joined
[17:44] <[Coke]> Yah, I'd leave it.

[18:34] <ab5tract> I don't like the idea of excluding non-Artistic 2.0 licensed modules. 

[18:34] <ab5tract> So a problem solving ticket is probably the right way to go

[18:39] <ab5tract> The idea that we would reject GPL-licensed modules out of hand is anathema to me

[18:40] <lizmat> [Coke] said: "slightly argue against" so it's not at all this black and white, ab5tract   :-)

[18:40] <ab5tract> fair :)

[18:40] *** zenmov left
[18:40] *** zenmov_ joined
[19:07] *** Aedil left
[19:28] <[Coke]> the bigger problem solving issue is: what makes something eligible to be a RCM? I'm not aware of any criteria at the moment other than "abandoned" and maybe "author consent".

[19:29] <[Coke]> of all the criteria we could add, "not being artistic" would be a negative to the scoring, not a rejection.

[20:48] <ab5tract> I just don’t see why GPL is a negative in any sense. Artistic license is more or less legally untested (AFAIK) and Perl-only. We aren’t a corporation looking to leech off of MIT/BSD exclusively. I guess I’d prefer to leave anti-GPL sentiments to the villains rather than partaking in it ourselves

[20:55] *** [Coke] left
[21:06] <ab5tract> TIL that npm is released under the Artistic License :)

[21:09] <ab5tract> And also that the Artistic license has indeed been central to a relatively major legal case

[21:19] <patrickb> I'd be interested in a link.

[21:20] <patrickb> (For the legal case, not npm)

[21:35] <[Coke]> don't appreciate being called a villain.

[21:36] <[Coke]> Given our previous misunderstanding about what was actually said versus intent, I would have thought you'd be more careful in interactions with me going forward, ab5tract 

[21:36] <[Coke]> I'll open a problem solving ticket about the overall "what's the criteria", at least.

[21:40] <ab5tract> I didn’t intend to call you a villain [Coke], my apologies

[21:43] <ab5tract> I took it as a matter of course based on your clarifications that you are not inherently anti-GPL

[21:44] <ab5tract> patrickb: the legal case https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer

[21:46] <patrickb> Thanks,

[21:49] <ab5tract> Also there’s a vast difference between personal preferences and institutional mandates. My comment was only intended to reflect on the latter

[22:31] <grondilu> Hello, long time no see.  What can be assumed to be PWD of a shell command from the qx operator?

[22:33] <grondilu> I guess it's the current directory when the program is executed. silly me.

[22:33] <grondilu> the thing is : in my chess module I plan on using pieces images in a images/ directory, and manipulate them with a shell command.

[22:34] <grondilu> but that won't work outside of the module root directory, will it?

[22:45] <grondilu> basically what I'm wondering is how can I attach files to my programs so it can use it from wherever directory it is installed?

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu I had chess questions for you. But I see you have updated "Chess". (I need re-review it.)

[22:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, it is cool that you published FEN parser notebook and function in Wolfram Community and Wolfram Function Repository!

[23:09] <grondilu> antononcube  Yeah I had fun writing this, but the Wolfram Community ended up adding a completely different function to the core
