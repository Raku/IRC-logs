[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In raku.land there are two packages for doing core statistics functions like mean  and standard-deviation (sd) . One is called "Stats" the other "Statistics". Both of them have different kinds of deficiencies.

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, first, I will list those deficiencies and send them to the module authors via GitHub's issues.

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Second, I am 70% sure the authors would not adhere to my demands and I have to implement the core functions myself.

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is the best option?  1) Picking one of the packages and making PR(s). 2) Making a new package named "Statistics", and using different api tag. 3) Making a new package named "Statistics::Core".

[15:24] <[Coke]> adding a module with the same name but different API seems like the most... aggressive? I would reach out to the author and see if they'd be amenable to PRs before putting in the effort, but that seems best. new package new name seems middle of the road.

[15:26] <jdv> auth trumps api though so idk bout aggresive:)

[15:26] <jdv> impolite perhaps

[15:27] <[Coke]> Right, was just trying to pick a negative

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... Right, impolite, maybe...

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is why I made couple of remarks about preliminary GitHub issues filing and/or submitting PRs.

[15:37] *** itaipu left
[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That said, the author of "Stats" has not updated since 5 years ago, and has to not responded to my GitHub issue filed 2 years ago. (I use "Stats" in couple of mine packages.)

[15:40] <[Coke]> ... that's a pretty good indication.

[15:40] <[Coke]> if the license is appropriate, you could fork.

[15:40] <[Coke]> (and the code)

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Statistics" is an interesting effort, it seems. I cannot install it though. Also, it is too much R-inspired. (And R is horrible.)

[15:46] *** CIAvash joined
[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My "problem" is that I do not like short names like "Stats", I prefer "Statistics". On the other hand, I think "Statistics" should be a generic name space, not a particular module or package. (So, actually, I find the author of "Statistics" to be "obnoxious" and "aggressive.")

[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke "if the license is appropriate, [...]" -- good point, I did not check the licenses.

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, both of them use Artistic-2.0.

[15:49] *** CIAvash left
[15:51] *** itaipu joined
[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Has anyone considered putting an "abandon" clause in some of the licenses? I.e. What constitutes abandoned modules and what the community can do about them? (not a lawyer... no idea how this could be written or if it's even necessary)

[15:57] *** vrurg joined
[15:58] *** vrurg_ left
[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think those kind of considerations are baked-in in Artistic-2.0.

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I've only ever gotten so far into reading it

[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Chat GPT points out : Key aspects of the Artistic License 2.0 include:      1.    Permitted Uses: It allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the licensed software.     2.    Distribution of Modified Versions: It requires that modified versions are clearly marked as different from the original and that the changes are documented.     3.    No Warranty: It disclaims any warranties, making it clear that

[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> the software is provided ‚Äúas is.‚Äù

[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> so I guess that answers my question

[17:10] *** xinming joined
[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I didn't adjust temp. I went to the website.

[17:22] *** CIAvash joined
[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That should have temperature adjustment. Usually, it is set to 0.7, but in order to get robust, correct results for "serious" document queries I use 0.3√∑0.4 .

[17:29] <[Coke]> m: say 0.3√∑0.4

[22:28] <tbrowder> hi, i need to round-trip a utf8-c8 file *starting with slurping it*. the docs give an example of such, but it's not clear to me how to apply it. the example starts with creating and *then* reading.

[22:28] <tbrowder> the example shows just a few chars, not hundres

[22:29] <tbrowder> *hundreds or thousands.

[22:29] <ugexe> .slurp(:enc<utf-c8>) ?

[23:03] <tbrowder> well: .slurp(:enc<utf8-ce>, and the answer is: spurt $new, $old, :enc<utf8-c8>;

[23:04] *** skyesoss joined
[23:05] <tbrowder> thnx for the feedback, i have been typoing ':env' instead of ':enc' üò¶
