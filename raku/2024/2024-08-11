[01:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I think it is a good idea to add the raku.land link to GitHub's page.

[16:56] <tbrowder> well i just spent some time on my widows VM and remember many reasons why i (not speaking for anyone else) am not fond of windows: not much practical can be done at the cli for non-expert users.

[16:57] <tbrowder> *windows VM

[17:05] <[Coke]> Something we can help with?

[17:15] <tbrowder> hm, git bash shell might help. [Coke], thanks. if you have some time, i'm trying to figure out why i can't get pdf totext output usable on my copy of PDF::Extract. mine is at "https::/github.com:tbrowder/raku-PDF-Extract". only the  ".github/workflows/windows.yml" is installed at the moment and it's stripped down into a class version of PDF::Extract and a plain raku run version bracketed by =begin/=end comment for manual selection.

[17:32] <izel> hi, following https://dev.to/lizmat/walking-the-rakuast-tree-3fbd, shouldn't this work:

[17:32] <izel> m: use experimental :rakuast; CHECK { say $*CU }

[17:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7130cb88: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§An exception X::Dynamic::NotFound occurred while evaluating a CHECK:‚ê§Dynamic variable $*CU not found‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§Exception details:‚ê§  Dynamic variable $*CU not found‚ê§    in block  at <tmp> line‚Ä¶¬ª

[17:33] <izel> work in the sense that no error but RakuAST::CompUnit.new(...) output

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I want to solicit diagrams that illustrated pipeline programming in Raku. I.e. using the forward feed operator ==> . (Or <==.)

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Last night after trying to convince DALL-E to do that I got this sub-optimal result:
