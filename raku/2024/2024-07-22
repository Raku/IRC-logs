[08:08] <wayland> .tell librasteve Nice!  I'm going to be focussed on the Table-Oriented Programming stuff for at least the next few months though, I think.

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Can you post links to your TOP writings. (I think you did some time ago,,,)

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> TOP eq  Table Oriented Programming

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Found the link(s): https://wayland.github.io/table-oriented-programming/

[12:40] <wayland> Sorry, yep, that's the one.

[14:42] <None> Hi everybody. Just jump here to ask why raku? Like I seem like a fun lang to side earn but I want to know what its it really niche to exploit its benefits.

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None 1) Grammars are first class citizens. 2) OOP for grammars and grammar-based interpreters. 3) Very good CLI script making support.

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None One of the consequences or 1 and 2 -- best LLM interaction support.

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None But it really depends on your background and interests. At this point, I recommend Raku only to people who are curious or interested in it. (To general, "simple" programming enthusiasts.)

[15:24] <None> Like it seems that the tokenice builtin fit perfect for lsp for the parsers. But why i was saying is that i really wouldnt like to try it in a project that it doesn't fit it. Like low level programming or linux stuff, or web programming or data science. Like if I go with LLM i just have to build all the matrices and math related. So thats my

[15:24] <None> question, where does it fit better?

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None I try to do Data Science with Raku often. See for example this Reddit discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1d079vg/age_at_creation_for_programming_languages_stats/

[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is related video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnjMVSfT8w

[15:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None "if I go with LLM i just have to build all the matrices and math related" -- I am not sure what you mean by this. Are you talking about implementing/building the computational machinery for training LLMs?

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None If, yes, that is not trivial in any language. And Raku is only partially fit for this: 1) No support of sparse matrices or tensorsl; 2) There is a relatively good dense matrix package, but it is, sort off, abandoned; 3) There are libraries connecting GSL, but they only work on Linux; 4) Raku is generally fairly slow for these kind of computations.

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @None Raku is good for "web programming" -- I forgot to mention that. (Mostly) because of the package "Cro".

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Can be generated with "JavaScript::D3".)

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am inclined to start a new package called "Math::SpecialFunctions". As far as I can tell -- searching raku.land -- there is not such package. There are only a few related submissions in RosettaCode. (Which I might use.)

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If you think that functionality / package is going to be a duplicate, please say so!

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Note, that "Math::Libgsl::Function" does not count.

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I cannot install it on any of my macs.)

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is there a way to export a term declaration? something like OUR::{'&term:<¶>'} := $?NL;

[21:06] *** thaewrapt joined
[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve  I think our sub term:<¶> {!!!} should work.

[21:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube - close enough - its sub term:<¶> is export { $?NL };
