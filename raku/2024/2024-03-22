[09:02] <seeg123456> hello, https://docs.raku.org/routine/encoding#___top is there any reason why windows-1250 is not in moarvm encodings? :)

[09:02] <seeg123456> stumbled upon that when trying to decode a csv file

[09:11] *** Manifest0 joined
[10:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @seeg123456 Can you post the problematic CSV file somewhere? (Or a fragment of it.)

[11:18] <seeg123456> it's basically CP-1250 encoded

[11:20] <seeg123456> https://mega.nz/file/tG1GGbaS#lzh7ztuE0L87UGt5Tn4MV2GYPTvDKsmeGR4ggFWr57Q

[11:20] <seeg123456> I use Text::CSV; and then csv(in => './kody_stacji.csv.orig');

[11:20] <seeg123456> it works when I first run 'iconv -F cp1250 -o UTF-8 ...'

[11:21] <seeg123456> I guess it would be nice to have csv(in => ..., encoding => 'windows-1250'); but apparently that encoding is unknown

[11:37] <ugexe> There is 1251 and 1252

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugexe When I am trying to instll a package I am develioping with zef I get the error "lang-call cannot invoke object of type 'VMNull' belonging to no language" . lizmat mentioned to create an issue with "--ll-exception stacktrace". I do not think I use that with zef, right?

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... it seems RAKUDO_OPT has to be used.

[12:16] <seeg123456> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1250

[12:16] <seeg123456> these are different ones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251

[12:16] <seeg123456> 1251 is cyryllic

[12:51] <ugexe> antoncube: `RAKUDO_OPT="--ll-exception" zef install . --debug`

[12:52] <ugexe> otherwise `raku --ll-exception path/to/some/bin/zef . --debug`

[12:52] <ugexe> oh, you already mentioned RAKUDO_OPT :)

[12:58] <ugexe> seeg123456: maybe you could write a encoder/decoder for for windows-1250. you implement a encoder and decoder and then register them in the encoding registry. then you could do `csv(..., encoding => 'windows-1250')` or use that encoding anywhere else that takes an encoding name

[13:00] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/7cf5d557ef40f21d2e35520d2a440423 - here is an example of one i wrote that works with 'base64'

[22:19] <guifa> What characters might we possibly to be able to use as a decent new twigil?

[22:20] <guifa> Looks like hyphen or apostrophe are about all that's left maybe

[22:22] * guifa is finally trying to figure out logical programming in Raku 

[22:25] <guifa> I'm thinking a syntax like 

[22:26] <guifa> rule parent(X,Y) { child(Y,X) }; except that not all variables might be in the declaration like

[22:27] <guifa> rule grandparent(X,Y) { child(Y,Z) && child(Z,X) }; 

[22:38] *** ptc left
[22:42] *** jpn joined
[22:50] <SmokeMachine> guifa: what the new twigil will represent?

[22:50] <guifa> SmokeMachine: a variable to be used for logical processing

[22:51] <guifa> (not sure if you're familiar with languages like prolog, etc)

[22:52] <guifa> but I need to distinguish between standard variables.  Maybe just use Â£foo for Logic hahaha?

[22:55] <SmokeMachine> Iâ€™ve, while writing that, thought on doing something like that for ProblemSolver (https://github.com/FCO/ProblemSolver)

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The variations I had over "RED" were much meaner.

[22:57] <SmokeMachine> (About ProblemSolver, Please, ignore how bad it isâ€¦ I was just testingâ€¦)

[22:58] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: for example?

[22:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Now, "Data ANalitics" = "DAN" is nice, but it is also a little cryptic. ðŸ˜›

[22:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Hmm... they all seem easily generated with LLMs.

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, except two: "Raccoon Enslaving Nutrias" and "Refilling Edible Diapers" -- too mean for most "official" LLMs to generate them.

[23:05] <SmokeMachine> Iâ€™m reading about prologâ€¦

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ðŸ™‚ Good. Read about "datalog" too.
