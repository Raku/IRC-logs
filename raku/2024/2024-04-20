[00:18] <lucs> ab5tract: Thanks for the update, and for your work!

[00:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs Did ab5tract do something concrete?

[01:17] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Well, they seem to be looking into the problem a lot. No solution so far I think, but it appears to be clarifying.

[02:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs Oh, I see -- this is the disheartening problem you mentioned a day or so ago...

[02:26] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Yeah, it's a bit frightening to think that regex matches can fail somewhat arbitrarily.

[02:30] *** kylese left
[02:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, did you switch to another programming language yet?

[02:35] *** kylese joined
[02:37] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> No way üôÇ

[02:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think for the foreseeable future I "trapped" into Raku. Mostly, because of the LLM-regex-grammar combination.

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I used to do a lot of Perl -- and Raku is in many ways what Perl was destined to become.

[02:39] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> (if you believe in destiny and all that)

[02:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I hope I will never deal with Pearl again!!

[02:40] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Yeah, I'm really sad about that, because neither will I, yet it set the foundation of Raku.

[02:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Today, for some reason, I looked into Pearl packages for converting HTML to plain text and for diff-ing.

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Still, respectfully, it's spelled "Perl" üôÇ

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Damn, I was just wondering is it "Perl" or "Pearl"...

[02:42] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Yeah, no 'a'.

[02:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Nothing to do that (yet) in Raku?

[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Raku has the "too old" "Algorithm::Diff" -- I made some noise about it, after which there is a decision to make it a community module. That package is under documented, so I had to look into the original Perl code that Raku package is based on

[02:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> HTML can be converted to plain text in the package "Data::Importers". But something more sophisticated needs to be done. I'm using lynx now..

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> I love the Raku error messages that use the inline eject symbol ‚èè to show where it bailed out. It's such a neat idea

[10:29] *** jpn joined
[10:59] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Oh it's the eject symbol? In my font, it looks like some weird house-kind of thing

[11:01] <ab5tract> dr.shuppet: just a point regarding the QAST output when EVAL is involved: we don't get to see the post-EVAL QAST as it isn't evaluated

[11:02] *** jpn left
[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> ab5tract: Yes, I was referring to the pre-EVAL code seemingly being the same, meaning that the difference has to be outside of the QAST (the difference after the EVAL still has to come from somewhere)

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Also that's why I said that maybe the EVAL example isn't a good lead

[11:04] <ab5tract> my point was only that the EVAL does generate QAST, it's just that we can't see it to know whether its different

[11:06] <ab5tract> so yeah, not a good lead indeed

[11:07] <tbrowder> librasteve: thnx for pointer on yaml. i agree on diff.pl, should be diff.raku

[13:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sorry for this ignorant question -- Are "newly adopted" Raku community modules (e.g. "Algorithm::Diff") expected to show up here? https://github.com/raku-community-modules

[13:36] *** jpn joined
[13:43] *** MasterDuke joined
[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I forked "Algorithm::Diff" and changed it to have kebab-case names, license, and more correct or consistent output. See: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Algorithm-Diff

[20:57] <tbrowder> fyi, the ‚Äòdiffuse‚Äô graphical program is a handy tool for comparing two text files

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I need a "diff" routine in order to find discrepancies between differently derived collections of video transcripts. (Over the same videos.)
