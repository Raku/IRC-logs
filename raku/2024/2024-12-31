[21:27] <thatonelutenist> I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding the relevant part of the docs to find an answer for this one, is there an environment variable I can set to change the location of the ~/.raku directory?

[21:30] *** sjn left
[21:32] *** sjn joined
[21:43] <Voldenet> long story short, it's hardcoded

[21:43] <Voldenet> > https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/REPL.rakumod#L540

[21:44] <Voldenet> at least in one place

[21:46] <thatonelutenist> I like how you just linked a location where it actually _isn't_ hard coded lol 

[21:47] <Voldenet> HOME is env variable home, but .raku is hardcoded

[21:48] <Voldenet> while RAKUDO_HIST can be altered, the `.raku` part can't be

[21:48] <Voldenet> soâ€¦ this kinda means you can't really change this `.raku` part easily apart from changing HOME, which will obviously work

[21:49] <thatonelutenist> That does suck a bit, maybe something for me to work on in the future

[21:50] *** guifa joined
[21:50] <thatonelutenist> all I _really_ want is for project specific ~/.raku/bin and zef site directory, I tend to not install tools globally and make heavy use of direnv for my projects, I like to keep the root of my homedir clean, but it looks like I can at least pull that off with zef's environment variables

[21:50] <Voldenet> yeah, something like $*RAKU_HOME would be nice

[22:06] <Voldenet> for modules there's docs https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/docs/module_management.md

[22:06] <thatonelutenist> thank you

[22:07] <thatonelutenist> I'm currently prototyping some tooling for another language that's not quite done cooking yet in raku, but I've now got another item for the todo list 

[22:10] <Voldenet> hah, I knew I've recognized this problem https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2023-07-14.html#02:12

[22:20] <thatonelutenist> That'll get me going for now, I'm a nixos user and as a result my programming workflow is a bit, uh, different, and its always a bit extra fun working with languages that are less done baking

[22:25] <thatonelutenist> At the end of the day though, having a ~/.raku around even though raku isn't _actually_ installed on my system or user profile is an incredibly minor annoyance

[22:27] <ugexe> you could set $HOME i guess

[22:28] <ugexe> i guess that was already alluded to

[22:29] <thatonelutenist> yeah, that is an option, but that would result in other things getting weird with how I have things setup

[22:30] <thatonelutenist> I've got a folder for each language I regularly work with in ~/Projects and a .envrc in each that automatically loads up the devshell and sets up the tools for that language to dump their stuff in a subfolder of ~/Project/$language/.env

[22:30] <thatonelutenist> my text editor runs outside the devshell and I use a direnv integration plugin to make it aware of this setup

[22:30] <thatonelutenist> I'm really not sure emacs would the value of $HOME being different for different buffers

[22:31] <thatonelutenist> *would like

[22:32] <thatonelutenist> oh well, when I get through my current project it won't be the first time I'm making modifications to a compiler to make things nicer for people who use weird systems that defy the linux norms

[23:21] <timo> isn't there a zef install --to or --into flag that goes along with RAKUDOLIB=something#/the/path/blabla ?

[23:21] <timo> probably inst# in front of the path?

[23:22] <ab5tract> I think so, but I think Raku also stashes precomps in .raku?

[23:24] <timo> i think where the precomp goes depends on the last entry in the repo chain (or i guess it's the first)
