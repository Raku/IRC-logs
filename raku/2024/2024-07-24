[02:55] <Xliff> Does anyone know how to run the Rakuast tests so I can see the current state?

[09:33] <wayland> If I do "sub this-function { return my-function() }", and my-function might use return or return-rw, how do I ensure that however my-function returns is the same way that this-function returns?  

[09:35] <lizmat> by using: return-rw my-function()

[09:35] <lizmat> basically the "return-rw" name is misleading

[09:35] <lizmat> it should really be "return-without-decontainerizing"

[09:36] <wayland> Nice!  Thanks!  :)

[17:38] <[Coke]> https://imgur.com/a/57i77PM - colors on that look OK?

[17:38] <[Coke]> (I can easily do a 4 color print, but a 6 color print would be too much)

[17:39] <[Coke]> "4 Color Camelia Keychain"

[17:44] <lizmat> feels like the keyring attachment would be a weak spot?

[17:47] <[Coke]> Any suggestion on where to move it?

[17:48] <[Coke]> tempting to maybe replace the legs entirely with it. :)

[17:49] <[Coke]> (can also do a print as just a token instead of a keychain)

[17:58] <lizmat> the yellow bit inside the P on the left (for the viewers) wing

[17:58] <lizmat> ?

[18:01] <[Coke]> not sure if I can do an interior one easily with this tool.

[18:01] <[Coke]> Will scope it out

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Without the red and green colors it seems too flat. Interesting idea for a keychain, though.

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, there should be 3D printing file for it.

[19:57] <[Coke]> I can make a 6 color file, I just only have a 4 color printer.
