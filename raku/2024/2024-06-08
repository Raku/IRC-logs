[00:31] <wayland> antononcube: Have you considered a GraphQL backend for DataQueryWorkflows?  Or OpenAPI?  

[00:38] <wayland> antononcube: Also, I'm not understanding the difficulty of adding a new backend for DataQueryWorkflows (under the Raku space).  Is there a feature that's missing in TOP that you need for this?  Maybe not everything can be converted to TOP, but I think we should be able to get a moderately functional mapping.  But first, I need to finish at least one version of TOP :p 

[01:08] <wayland> Interestingly, all of us are trying different approaches at making a generic frontend for data processing structures in array/tabular format, each with a different set of emphases.  

[01:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland There is no principle difficulty -- it is just the bottleneck of my understanding how to convert natural language specs into TOP-code.

[01:09] <wayland> Oh!  Right.  Well, I think that can be overcome as I actually release the working thing and write documentation for it.  

[01:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland Yeah, I think all three of us (you, I, and Steve Row) understand that...

[01:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... from what you are saying it seems TOP is less mature than I thought...

[01:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have not considered GraphQL as target of the DSL interpreter, but it might be not that difficult to make an initial version. I have no idea how to test it.

[01:17] *** Manifest0 left
[01:23] <wayland> Anyone know if there's any plan to release a hard copy of Think Raku?  

[01:24] <wayland> antononcube: Agreed, now -- I was just late to the party :p 

[01:25] <wayland> antonon: Yeah, with the TOP stuff I took the opposite approach from what I usually take -- I wrote the ideas down first, instead of starting with code.  

[01:35] <wayland> My point (that I completely forgot to mention :p ) with the 3 different libraries we're writing, (plus DBIish as well) is that the next version of Raku (ie. Raku 7, whatever the next big rewrite is) needs this kind of stuff built in, just like the concepts from various Perl 5 modules (Parse::RecDescent, Moose, DateTime) were put into Raku.  

[01:42] <wayland> antononcube: You could also make a DBIish backend, combining SQL and Raku (if you haven't already -- I'm just looking at your diagram)

[01:48] *** jpn left
[01:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> SQL is done to a point.

[01:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have tested it with simple specs only.

[13:12] <tbrowder> re: Think Raku, does its license allow someone to use another publisher to produce a hard copy? if so it probably should be updated before going that route.

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, does it licencse make it amenable to be used in a specially-biased Raku-LLM ?

[13:19] <tbrowder> publisher like https://diggypod.com

[13:35] *** jpn joined
[13:41] <wayland76> I think the last hardcopy was called Think Perl 6, and it's been updated online since then.  

[13:43] <wayland76> I've got the code " has Int $!doc-width  = 1683; " and I get: Error: Type check failed in assignment to $!width; expected Num but got Int (1683)

[13:44] <wayland76> Is there a way to tell it to just coerce other than using .Int on the number?  

[13:45] <wayland76> Actually, my bad -- please ignore.  

[13:45] <lizmat> 1683 looks pretty Inty to me  :-) 

[13:57] *** jpn left
[13:59] <wayland76> Yeah, turns out I was passing it to Cairo, which does some native stuff.  It turned out to only be 2 numbers, so I just coerced them with .Num

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ParSeq suddently moved from a micro version into mini versions.

[14:25] <lizmat> yeah, all goals that I had set, looked like they were reached

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üëç

[14:26] <lizmat> integration into rak / App::Rak turned out to reveal a number of issues, that haven't all been solved yet :-(

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I should start keeping / submitting a "Changes" file in my packages.

[14:27] <lizmat> App::Mi6 basically forces you to do so, one of its features  :-)

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, going parallel is natural way speed up "App::Rak".

[14:28] <lizmat> App::Rak already does that, but was hindered by the limitations of .hyper

[14:29] <lizmat> which was the impetus for me to start scratching that .hyper itch that I've had for years  :-)

[14:31] <lizmat> so the "drop in replacement for hyperize" goal was definitely not reached yet

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good to know!

[14:54] <lizmat> so: ok to use in scripts atm, not yet to integrate into other modules :-(

[15:23] <tbrowder> hi, i'm working on a new module, Checkwriter, to gen pdf checks on standard printers using standard check papers. first out will be for us dollars using Office Depot single check paper on Letter. Later, if there is interest, I can produce for other sizes and langiages and currencies

[15:24] <teatime> do you need MICR ink

[15:24] <teatime> you can get it for laser printers

[15:25] <tbrowder> on A4 or other stanfard sizes. it uses Lingua::EN::Numbers. my bank does not need MICR ink, buy i do have the MICT

[15:25] <tbrowder> MICR font

[15:26] <tbrowder> and i do use a laser printer

[15:27] <tbrowder> the font is included with my published FontFactory::Type1

[15:29] <tbrowder> Checkwriter progress can be viewed at https://github.com/tbrowder/Checkwriter.

[15:29] <teatime> tbrowder++

[15:30] <tbrowder> this was my motivation to urge more language support for Lingua:XX::Numbers

[15:33] <tbrowder> checks are not printable yet, but hopefully before too long. lot's of behind-the-scenes scafolding for privacy and account accuracy.

[15:36] <tbrowder> btw, my bank (and many others now i'll bet) can take check deposits via a picture with its app, so, at least for a personal account, the MICR font ink seems to be no factor.

[15:37] <tbrowder> but i will try it all out in my banking world before publishing it

[16:12] *** [Coke] joined
[16:23] <tbrowder> oh, actually, until full language support, the actual check writing is done with a prompt/response dialog, so, with an appropriate option, the user can enter enter the words needed instead of having the calculated based on the number amount.

[16:24] * lizmat wonders where cheques are still being used

[16:24] <lizmat> I haven't seen one in 15+ years

[16:25] <tbrowder> well, in my world, local small business ppl take checks or cash

[16:27] <tbrowder> many don't want service charges. our local tax authority likes debiting a bank acct, but their UI is terrible

[16:28] <tbrowder> but i hear rumors that the us fed banking system is going to poke noses into the situation

[16:29] <tbrowder> anyhoo, i still need checks and that means Raku

[16:30] <lizmat> great to hear being able to use Raku for such a goal  :-)

[16:31] <lizmat> the last check I got out of the US for about 20 dollar cent, would cost 50 euros to actually process

[16:31] <lizmat> I decided not to have it processed  :)

[16:45] <tbrowder> wise move üòÅ

[17:40] <coleman> liz lives in the future (Europe)

[17:41] <coleman> where you can buy a cell phone without going to the company store like it's an 1890's coal town

[17:42] <coleman> I needed a cashier's check recently, and I realized I hadn't gone to a physical bank in years. It had been so long they needed to ask me a long series of questions to verify my identity

[17:44] *** Sgeo joined
[19:10] <tbrowder> ymmv 

[19:13] <tbrowder> i'm from a different gen, i still love going to physical stores, the post office, and the bank, and esp. the hardware store. alas, not many small computer stores left, Best Buy maybe best where i live now.

[19:13] <tbrowder> and i like the grocery store

[19:13] <lizmat> Ah, don't get me wrong, I love going to stores as well....  it's just that I don't need cheques to do shopping

[19:14] <tbrowder> gotcha, i do understand

[19:15] <tbrowder> and using raku for "practical" things is also very fun

[19:20] <tbrowder> speaking of that, some time ago i asked zoffix about the source for some nice perl6 booklets he had made with Adobe. he said we could do whatever with it.

[19:21] <tbrowder> it would be nice if someone with access to Adobe stuff could update it with a name change and any other words or code changes.

[19:22] <tbrowder> it probably needs someone with good graphics design skills and an artistic talent

[19:57] <lizmat> antononcube looks like I need to re-imagine infectiousness in ParaSeq  :-(

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Good luck!
