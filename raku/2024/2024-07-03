[04:13] <ingy> librasteve: I feel like what happened is that people who were not involved with TPRC in any way, saw the recordings come up on youtube, which was Perl heavy. Instead of thinking, damn I should have showed up to support Raku, people say how can they call this TP"R"C?

[04:14] <ingy> This is a Netflix show on Perl and Raku, it's 100% volunteer plan, attend, speak. The youtube recordings only document who actually showed up to speak.

[04:16] <ingy> "ISN'T a Netflix show..."

[04:20] <ingy> Organizing this thing is a thankless job that anyone is welcome to help with but only a few dedicated people do. Util is the most dedicated of all and 100% Raku. If all of you want to make it feel like The Raku and Perl Conference, there's nothing stopping you from making it happen.

[10:51] <Xliff> Is there a way I can convert a module name (ala "Cro::HTTP::Server") and get its location on disk?

[11:01] <lizmat> possibly the info is somewhere in here: dd $*REPO.repo-chain.first(*.?candidates("Cro::HTTP::Server"))

[11:02] <Xliff> Hmm 'Nil  = Nil'

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff There is Distribution object : https://docs.raku.org/type/CompUnit#method_distribution

[11:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That has Distribution::Path : https://docs.raku.org/type/Distribution/Path

[11:06] <Xliff> lizmat++ # Was running it with raw raku. It can do what I need. Thanks!

[11:10] <tbrowder> ingy: i‚Äôm glad to hear that info. i have met Util at the 2 toc l‚Äôve attended and do not remember him saying anything about that. i have written the perl org about hosting tpc in Pensacola but never got a response. i have to say transparency is not a mark one can use with them

[11:10] <tbrowder> *tpc

[11:13] <tbrowder> btw, i can now ssh in to our macbook with just ‚Äússh macos‚Äù, but it is weird inside it.

[11:14] <tbrowder> i was able to install homebrew. then ‚Äúbrew install raku‚Äù installed v2024.06.

[11:16] <tbrowder> but no zef! tried ‚Äúbrew install zef‚Äù but got msgs about zef being unknown.

[11:17] <tbrowder> i guess i need to install it the ‚Äúold‚Äù way

[11:20] <tbrowder> oh, i meant to say Util is a very nice and helpful person, as well as a very smart guy. i enjoyed all his presentations, too.

[11:24] <SmokeMachine> One of the best things on going to TPRC to me was to know util‚Ä¶

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As mentioned on Monday it seems I should D. Conway‚Äôs talk (because of the AI/LLM themes in it), but I still have not been curious enough to allocate the time and do it‚Ä¶

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Now, of course we can use AI to

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ‚Ä¶show the world of TPRC according to @ingy.

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I.e. as a NETFLIX show.)

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> It mentions AI en passant but not much more

[12:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vendethiel Good to know -- from the LLM extracted summaries of his talk it seems LLM/AI had significant share.

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I haven‚Äôt read the summary, but the LLM hasn‚Äôt seen the talk :)

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> He started off the talk with an AI angle but it was really a set up

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vendethiel Well, the LLMs I used heard the talk.

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I could have fed some image of talk's video recording, but I did not see the point.

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (The talk is fairly long, hence, most likely many details on its main themes are given.)

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is one of the LLM summaries I am talking about: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Markdown/LLM-over-The-Once-and-Future-Perl-Damian-Conway-TPRC-2024-ChatGPT.md

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This one seems to give a faithful rendition of the number of Raku people attending TPRC-2024 and how they are seen by the Perl attendees:

[16:20] <[Coke]> let's say I have a set of letters set<a b c> - if I wanted to get all the possible combinations of size 2, it's just ".combinations(2)" - what if I want all the combinations *allowing repeats*? do I have to manually construct all the possible repeating ones out of all the possible smaller combinations (which is simple in this case, but not where the size of the combinations is higher)

[16:21] *** soverysour left
[16:23] <[Coke]> (in this case, I'd be trying to create a list with ((a a) (a b) (a c) (b a) (b b) (b c) (c a) (c b) (c c))

[16:29] <[Coke]> ugh, this harder for larger differences. if I had a combination count of 5, and needed to "inflate" a 2-item combo of (a b), it could be done many different ways (a a a b b), (a a a a b)... Will take advantage of the fact that I will probably never have more than a single repeat.

[16:37] <[Coke]> is there method on baghash or similar that given a BagHash of "a b(2) c" returns <a b b c>?

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke It other words your are asking for permutations with repetitions, right?

[16:39] <[Coke]> no, combinations

[16:39] <[Coke]> I don't care about order, but I wish to allow duplicates of individual elements.

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, got it.

[16:40] <[Coke]> (so I don't want (b a) and (a b) , but I do want (a a) and (b b))

[16:40] <[Coke]> (to clarify, I don't want *BOTH* of those first two)

[16:41] <[Coke]> I've already given up on this, btw, and am doing a cheat which will probably be fine (writing a wordle helper)

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am thinking using Cartesian product to get the tuples, sorting each tuple, then calling unique.

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there is .kxxv for your second query although it promises no order

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Close : (('a', 'b') X ('a', 'b'))¬ª.sort.unique ?

[16:45] <[Coke]> that works for a combinations(2), but I am asking if there's a generic for any $n

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube>  my @data = <a b c>; ([X] |(@data xx 3))¬ª.sort.unique 

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think the above does that  -- I am still "evaluating it" for correctness.

[16:46] <[Coke]> nice!

[16:47] <[Coke]> looks good at first glance.

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, so far... üôÇ

[16:53] <tbrowder> ok, i‚Äôm getting ssh access to my our macbook. got homebrew working. got raku installed.

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I think the unique invocation needs non-default settings for :as and :with. I see repetitions of some the tuples.

[17:00] <tbrowder> got zef installed from its cloned repo. question on setting exe paths for homebrew mac users: how are you setting paths? remote logins path setups are weird in linux. i assume it should be same with mac. anyone have  a definitive answer?

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Here is my revised code:  my @data = <a b c>; ([X] |(@data xx 3)).unique(as => {$_.join(' ')}); 

[17:05] *** dakkar left
[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> @tbrowder: Exe paths, or lib paths?

[17:25] <[Coke]> I'm a mac user, but I use rakubrew for installing raku, not homebrew

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I strongly advice to use rakubrew on macOS

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Agh, Coke beat me to it...

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder The alternative is to directly copy the raku distributions to the "/Applications" folder, but then you have manually give permissions to run for the related apps and libraries in the System Settings.

[17:28] *** soverysour left

[22:04] <tbrowder> nope, unknown

[22:09] <tbrowder> i‚Äôm gonna try manual zef install again with ‚Äúzef install . -to=inst#~/.raku/bin‚Äù

[22:09] <tbrowder> then add that path to $PATH

[22:20] <tbrowder> or whatever the correct incantation is

[22:25] <ugexe> how does rakubrew not work? it shoudl just work

[22:26] <ugexe> you wouldnt install to ~/.raku/bin... i'm not sure where you got that from

[22:26] <ugexe> if you want to install to the home repo you do -to=home
