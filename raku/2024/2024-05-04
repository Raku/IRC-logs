[17:16] <ptc> ugexe: I finally got around to incorporating your suggestions into the "building and testing Raku" post.  See https://peateasea.de/building-and-testing-raku-in-appveyor/#test_script and https://peateasea.de/building-and-testing-raku-in-appveyor/#install-the-dists-upstream-dependencies for the updated text.

[17:17] <ptc> ugexe: please let me know if anything else needs fixing up :-)

[17:17] <ptc> ugexe: thanks again for the tips!

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> I wonder how much quality would bring if the commonly used compilers were written in Raku

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> As seen with the adoption of Rust for Asahi Linux GPU drivers accelerating development, there is only so much which fits into the head of a developer, and using a suitable programming language can free up a lot of that space

[20:25] <teatime> compilers for what

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> For anything I guess, I had the common compiled programming languages like C and C++ mostly in mind

[20:26] <teatime> mm, well wouldn't you want something a little more, like, stable and finished for that

[20:27] <teatime> I don't think raku is quite into the LTS game yet

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @teatime LTS = Long Term Support?  Loony Testers Singing?

[20:45] <teatime> you had it right the first time

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm.. my "first time" was actually "Living Through Syntax-errors".

[20:45] <teatime> gaga

[20:45] <teatime> haha rather.  Better Living through Syntax Errors

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, last one: "Laughter Triggering Software".
