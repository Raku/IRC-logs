[12:47] <kawaii> Just logged in to cancel my IRCCloud subscription and give a fond farewell to old Raku friends. Taking a step away from software dev to focus on my new career as a member of Ukraine's foreign legion. :) Thanks for all the kind people who helped me make cool software in Raku over the last... 6 years? Hope to return to working with my favourite programming language sometime in the future.

[12:48] <jdv> good luck

[12:57] <tbrowder> well i just found a trap (at least for moi): failed to specifically close a file handle when it was being opened twice in the same sub. it's taken me several days to figure it out. i remember with Perl i think it was a "best practice" (Damian's book?) to not close a file handle (but it probably said: unless you are reusing it for a new file).

[13:01] <tbrowder> anyhoo i did learn a lesson (but, unfortunately, some other memory got popped off)

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Guest37: please take a look at this https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/ValueList

[13:52] *** librasteve_ joined
[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Raku provides a semi-immutable Positional datatype: List. A List can not have any elements added or removed from it. However, since a list can contain containers of which the value can be changed, it is not a value type.

[22:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo Have you tested Docker file build and run in "Marrow"?  (I assume "yes.") Have you tested with both PostgreSQL and SQLite?

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Yes, although the automated tests are only sqlite

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok - good to know!
