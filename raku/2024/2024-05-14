[04:17] <kathe> do anyone of you know is mr. wall is well?

[04:18] <kathe> apologies about the weird english, i have not yet finished my first coffee.

[04:18] <kathe> i read a tweet mentioning mr. wall being unwell.

[04:19] <kathe> but that tweet was buried amongst new tweets and i'm unable to locate it.

[04:19] <kathe> i really hate the way twitter handles tweet, espeically those which are promoted.

[04:20] <kathe> again, apologies about my weird english.

[04:26] <kathe> okay, i gotta go now.

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there are an app that manages the "Changes" files in packages that is not "App::Mi6" ?

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is most likely an ignorant question -- I like the idea of maintaining a "Changes" file but "App::Mi6" does too many other things...

[09:28] *** thaewrapt joined
[09:29] <lizmat> some of the other things of App::Mi6 can be switched off in the dist.ini file

[09:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok -- thanks!

[09:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I was hoping "App::Rak" can manage "Changes" files...)

[09:32] <lizmat> hehe...  it has trouble enough managing its own Changes file  :-)

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right -- that could be a jump-starting motivation!

[10:11] <Manifest0> lizmat, hi. App::Rak is requiring rak with version 0.0.54, however zef is only able to find the version 0.0.53 

[10:11] <lizmat> that's from the repo, right?  not from zef ?

[10:12] <Manifest0> from zef. 

[10:12] <Manifest0> ===> Updating: App::Rak:ver<0.2.25>:auth<zef:lizmat>

[10:12] <Manifest0> ===> Searching for missing dependencies: rak:ver<0.0.54>:auth<zef:lizmat>

[10:12] <Manifest0> ===> Failed to find dependencies: rak:ver<0.0.54>:auth<zef:lizmat>

[10:12] <Manifest0> Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="rak" to skip)

[10:12] <Manifest0> !!!> Failed upgrading *all* modules

[10:12] <lizmat> that's... weird

[10:13] *** jpn left
[10:13] <Manifest0> output from: zef update; zef upgrade

[10:14] <lizmat> well, rak 0.0.54 is now in zef

[10:15] *** jpn joined
[10:19] <Manifest0> now i'm having another error: https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/94f2f86a1b10

[10:26] <Manifest0> uninstalling App::Rak and install it again, solved the issue

[10:42] <tbrowder> antononcube: re App::Mi6, what is "too much" about it? also, have you looked at Mi6::Helper? I am starting to add a "lint" mode to check for synch between META6.json's "resources" list and a distro's "resources" directory.

[10:47] *** thaewrapt joined
[10:49] <lizmat> Manifest0: 0.2.25 of App::Rak and 0.55 of rak are now officially released   0.54 contained a new bug showing up on the release of App::Rak  :-(

[14:49] <tbrowder> note the lint mode in mi6-helper can be used in any distro repo, even one NOT  using App::Mi6 management (which is highly recommended), right lizmat?

[15:49] <lizmat> indeed

[17:16] <Xliff> Can anyone reach this site? http://testmoodle.mcucc-ta.org

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I get: > Your theme license is only valid for Moodle 4.1! You need to purchase the correct license to continue using this theme. > For your license upgrade options please contact us.

[17:25] <[Coke]> also "not secure"

[17:31] <Xliff> OK, thanks for verifying it can be seen.

[17:31] <Xliff> I'm trying to get a certificate from certbot and it's saying it's got a firewall issue.

[17:36] <[Coke]> you have something like azure front door in front of it?

[17:37] <[Coke]> (something that might act different depending on who is asking)

[17:59] <Xliff> [Coke]: No. It's just a mess of a setup that I've inherited

[17:59] <Xliff> Moodles are tempermental.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: maybe this can help (its a raku script that set's up certbox for a Wordpress site, but same steps I guess) https://github.com/librasteve/raku-CLI-Wordpress/blob/main/lib/CLI/Wordpress.rakumod#L77
