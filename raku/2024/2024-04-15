[03:26] <lucs> This bug really scares me, my trust in regex matches is shaken:

[04:20] <holyghost> Hi, I started on the widget kit in EyeofTheBeholder, it's available in v0.1.3. It will be non-specific image system wise.

[04:20] <holyghost> (Such as png, SDL etc.)

[05:30] *** Sgeo left
[05:32] <holyghost> The kit is unpatened, as I can write better ones with the design patterns

[10:42] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to holyghost

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lucs: it scares me too â€¦ i would like to see some urgency on the fix and some explanation of how it got shimmed between Raku And NQP (which works ok) and why the fix is a complete and trustworthy resolution

[12:55] <ab5tract> librasteve: would you mind you share the NQP version? I don't see it on the ticket thread and it seems like it could be useful

[12:55] <ab5tract> *mind sharing

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> ab5tract: I used simply nqp -e 'say("_20__32022320" ~~ /2022320/)' to test, that works

[14:56] <tbrowder> ++lizmat: looking fine

[15:01] <tbrowder> librasteve: i noted yr use of raku oauth and went back to visit the module. noted yr contribution there. i made a poor pr which was accepted after brian cleaned it up. i would like to submit another pr mainly to improve the visibility and clarity of the various workflows and good exampled. i wonder if you would be interested in helping?

[15:37] <ab5tract> librasteve, lucs: a cause has been determined -- https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5550#issuecomment-2057154673

[15:38] <ab5tract> I will continue poking at the issue but I wanted to update you on some progress

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: I'm happy to try --- suggest you fork OAuth2 module and make your porposed changes there in a way that is obvious to me (ie in a new branch or PR other there) - then I can come in a do a review ... just leave in comments for the bits where you need advice / not sure

[17:56] <greenfork> Here a person says that "the `use vX.XX` pragma is underappreciated [...] In Perl and #Rakulang I'm never version locked by the interpreter." https://bitbang.social/@profoundlynerdy/112271303704703707

[17:57] <greenfork> How true is that about Raku? I heard some opinions that Rakudo breaks things from release to release, so the language is at 6.d for quite some time but it doesn't really help?

[18:00] <gfldex> greenfork: We don't force to request a language version and that may have been a mistake.

[18:07] <greenfork> gfldex: Does it make any difference to specify use v6.d; if the Rakudo compiler still changes and there's around 3 years since the 6.d version?

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> greenfork: I am not aware of any incompatible changes since 6.d was released - what do you have in mind? [there is use v6.PREVIEW for the new stuff, but that is obviously separate]

[18:12] <greenfork> @librasteve for example Red was broken for the last two releases, v2024.02 -- https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/573, v2024.03 -- https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/574

[18:12] <greenfork> At leasts the tests didn't run successfully, don't know if it actually broke something

[18:26] <SmokeMachine> I yes, it did have conflictâ€¦ Red even have this to avoid them (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/d3744b10098ac00842b8dc4f9b50455f0fe2e70a/lib/Red.rakumod#L47). I thought Blib was there to find those casesâ€¦

[18:31] <[Coke]>  have Rakudoâ„¢ v2024.03 - when I run raku to get the REPL, it is now just spewing backtraces. pretty sure this was working even earlier today

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - ok thanks! (I guess will be a while before raku == perl stability)

[18:32] <[Coke]> blin, not Blib.

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> So I did some experiments with the Rakudo regex bug, and I have no idea how it is possible that the Rakudo compiler is behaving like that. Apparently .EVAL of the same string triggers the bug when the string is single-quoted, but doesn't when it is double-quoted

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> The strings are the same per eq, the ASTs dumped with --target=ast also look the same, beside the different quotes

[18:46] <[Coke]> do you have a gist that shows this?

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> [Coke]: I posted it on the GitHub issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5550#issuecomment-2057510994

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> I hope it's not just some weirdness on my machine ðŸ˜…

[18:54] <[Coke]> fwiw, tests 1-3 emit the same output here.

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> I re-copy-pasted the code directly from the GitHub comment, and I got different results (the same as I posted) from test1 and test2 both on my T2 Linux VM and on my Fedora 40 system (with the same 2024.03 Rakudo/NQP/MoarVM)

[19:09] <gfldex> greenfork: The plan is to support 6.d for the next 100 years. We might drop 6.c, because there where just to many mistakes in that language version. There have been cases where stuff that should have been in 6.e slipped into 6.d. That was most unfurtunate.
