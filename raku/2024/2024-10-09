[11:31] <timo> notable6__: bugbearer improve docs page of twigils: not-really-twigils $< and $. should be more helpful and link somewhere

[11:31] <notable6__> timo, Noted! (bugbearer)

[11:32] <timo> notable6__: bugbearer docs: somehow the subheadings for twigils on the twigils page render to empty-string, even though their id attribute properly has the text in them

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My "Raku Random Spirographs" post in X got â‰ˆ600 views within 24 hours. https://x.com/antononcube/status/1843650569669619870

[14:45] <[Coke]> timo: where do those bugs end up?

[14:50] <timo> you have to explicitly ask it for the contents of the category exactly like "weekly" but it doesn't have a convenient shortcut for use in the channel

[14:54] <timo> i just gotta remember to ask it when i have a "pour issues into some githubs" shaped tuit

[21:23] <ab5tract> antononcube: sounds interesting. is it a straughtforward scraper?

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It kind of is in Mathematica, but I am not sure how to do it Raku. What is the most developed or convenient XML parser in Raku's ecosystem

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am trying to parse this page with the package "XML": https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis-at.xml

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Extracting data from that XML with LLMs is too slow. (Kind of fun, but whatever...)

[21:34] *** guifa joined
[21:36] * [Coke] guesses https://github.com/raku-community-modules/XML

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I fed the README of "XML" to LLM and that helped getting the Raku code. I might be able to produce a "tracking" notebook, but it might be too late... ðŸ™‚

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Yes, thanks! That is what I tried/started using.

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is what I got so far:

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1293689894765334612/Raku-XML-Milton-tracking.png?ex=67084a1a&is=6706f89a&hm=8b751d4eb2ab222ff3a9fe589c0f58b71354a0b5582f297ec4864b7e9e93a4b0&

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I "just" have to figure out how to make the maps.

[21:43] *** doomlord joined
[21:43] <doomlord> Hello, do raku support multidimensional array fast reshaping ?

[21:43] <doomlord> With the stride factor I mean

[21:44] <doomlord> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_of_an_array

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes. You have to specify a sequence with the stride.

[21:44] <doomlord> How to do that?

[21:45] <doomlord> I donâ€™t find stride in the docs, but maybe Iâ€™m dumb

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is not clear:

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will make an example within 5 min.

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mean while, try this with a single array @a[1, 3 ... 10]

[21:46] <doomlord> Thank you!

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube>  my @a = 'a' .. 'z'; @a[1, 3 ... 10] 

[21:47] <doomlord> Oh but that takes more mental effort than a reshape function for multidimensional arrays

[21:47] <doomlord> For 1d is fine

[21:48] <doomlord> Although I can imagine writing my sequence generator helpera

[21:48] <doomlord> Helpers

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am still working on my MD example...

[21:48] *** doomlord left
[21:49] <timo> raku doesn't really support using a view into another array with a stride as if it were a regular array

[21:49] <timo> as in, there is no optimization for that use case built in

[21:51] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, just got that message for this code:  my $ma = random-real(20,(9,4)); say $ma.shape; say $ma[1, 3 ... 9; *] # Partially dimensioned views of shaped arrays not yet implemented. Sorry. 

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @doomlord But I support strides in "Math::SparseArray".

[23:28] <timo> took me a moment, but if i want to find the rakulang@programming.dev group to subscribe to on my mastodon interface i had to put @rakulang@programming.dev rather than the !rakulang@programming.dev it suggested on the programming.dev website

[23:30] <timo> i hadn't seen raku-lang.ir/en before i don't think

[23:32] <timo> unfortunately, in my interface the posts from the rakulang group don't show up from what i get from @rakulang@programming.dev
