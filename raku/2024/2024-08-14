[00:02] <tbrowder> guifa: look at CompUnit::Util. i think it is supposed to access nativecall stuff

[00:53] <guifa> CompUnit::Util explicitly uses internall-y stuff that's not guaranteed to be forward compatible

[13:05] <lizmat> with (<) the left *must* have fewer elems than the right

[13:05] <tbrowder> ok, proper subset, thnx!

[13:14] <tbrowder> so how do i do a test with  that? i've been getting errors on syntax as you can see above

[13:16] <tbrowder> CompUnit::Utils has a bad test and I'm trying to fix it with the ascii proper subset operator

[13:18] <lizmat> m: use Test; cmp-ok set(1,2), &[(<=)], set(1,2)

[13:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1586e96ae: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - ␤»

[13:18] <lizmat> m: use Test; cmp-ok set(1,2), &[(<)], set(1,2)

[13:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1586e96ae: OUTPUT: «not ok 1 - ␤# Failed test at <tmp> line 1␤# expected: Set.new(1,2)␤#  matcher: 'infix:«(<)»'␤#      got: Set.new(1,2)␤»

[13:19] <lizmat> &[foo] being short for &infix:<foo>

[13:19] <tbrowder> ok, many thanks!!

[13:39] <tbrowder> lizmat: are you going to put CompUnit::Utils in fez?

[13:41] <tbrowder> i will have a PR for it wherever it winds up. if the curr author doesn't respond, i may release another ver as author

[13:41] <lizmat> I did not get a reaction to https://github.com/LLFourn/p6-AttrX-InitArg/issues/5

[13:42] <lizmat> which feels odd, since they are still active on Github, even today

[13:43] <lizmat> perhaps make an issue in CompUnit::Util, reference the above issue

[13:43] <lizmat> see if they react to that

[13:44] <tbrowder> btw, just rewriting the bad test and substituting plain ascii (<=) instead of the incorrect unicode symbol worked

[13:44] <tbrowder> i have done so

[13:44] <lizmat> ah, ok.....  :-)

[13:45] <tbrowder> and i will tidy it up now that you have provided

[13:45] <tbrowder> the solution!

[13:45] <tbrowder> all his tests work fine

[15:17] <tbrowder> can someone looking for a challenge look at CompUnit::Util’s code and see if it’s very susceptible to obsolescence  due to nqp or Raku changes? thnx

[21:02] <Xliff> Does anyone know if Python can compile to a .so?

[21:02] <Xliff> Trying to shoehorn something into NativeCall...

[21:03] <lizmat> Inline::Python ?

[21:04] <Xliff> That's not an .so

[21:05] <Xliff> I do not want to Inline it, I want to NativeCall it.
