[15:39] <[Coke]> https://i.imgur.com/oc2QPg1.jpg - 4 color camelia keychain 3d print.

[15:39] <[Coke]> (marker for size)

[15:40] <lizmat> cool

[15:40] <[Coke]> (that's the slightly sparkly side, courtesy of the contoured bed plate.

[15:43] <lizmat> I assume white is one of the colors?

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Did color parts of 3D printed keychain with featured Sharpie?

[15:43] <[Coke]> white eyes, yellow face, blue smile, black body.

[15:43] <[Coke]> heh, no it's a 4-color printer.

[15:44] <[Coke]> (which is why I didn't do the full color version, printer only goes to 4, but then I can do an unattended print)

[15:44] <[Coke]> patterns on wings are yellow/blue

[16:03] <tonyo1> .

[16:09] <timo> have you experimented with different surface treatments, such as ... acetone i guess?

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> coke: can you share the source - maybe I can sell some merch at the LPRW?

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nail varnish?

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> got 7000 hits on my blog so far today

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Alternatively, please print and mail a keychain to every rakunista (rakuminati, etc.) who has more than 200 messages in Raku-IRC.

[16:29] <[Coke]> timo: no, just did a simple print on the textured plate. I haven't experimented with surface treatments in general

[16:30] <[Coke]> librasteve - sure, I just used the PNG off wikipedia, then used a tool on makerworld to reduce colors and add the keychain hook. I can share the model. It's a .3mf, is that ok?

[16:30] <[Coke]> I can also share a model without the keychain hole

[16:30] <[Coke]> I also don't mind printing a few and sending them along to whoever is going to the next con

[16:31] <[Coke]> but each print is about 1hour16min, so it won't be a lot.

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> …and you have to babysit the printing process, right?

[16:42] *** dakkar left
[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .3mf should be fine - theres a 3d print shop down the rod and I can get them to quote a price

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> as keychain please

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> road

[16:52] <[Coke]> No babysitting, really. Worst case it goes off the rails somehow and doesn't stop printing. usually if there's an error with adhesion or something, it's smart enough to figure out it's printing on air.

[16:55] <[Coke]> librasteve: https://gist.github.com/coke/464b2b41abb116129dd4fbbf27cf0ebe

[19:46] <b4252> installing Rakudo on macOS Monterey, after some security & privacy fixes, now get:

[19:47] <b4252> perl6

[19:47] <b4252> I ran into a problem while trying to set up Readline: Could not instantiate role 'ReadlineBehavior':

[19:47] <b4252> Cannot locate native library '(null)': dlopen(libreadline.7.dylib, 0x000A): tried: '//Applications/Rakudo/lib/libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file), '//Applications/Rakudo/lib/libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file), 'libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file),

[19:47] <b4252> '/Users/brucer42/git/personal/projects/swhbc/libreadline.7.dylib' (no such file)

[19:47] <b4252> Falling back to Linenoise (if present)

[19:47] <b4252> You may want to `zef install Readline` or `zef install Linenoise` or use rlwrap for a line editor

[19:48] <b4252> tried zef install Readline, zef thinks it's already there.

[19:51] <[Coke]> Did you install the native depds for Readline?

[19:51] <[Coke]> if you're on mac, do you have brew or ports?

[19:52] <lizmat> also: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/CAVEATS.md#macos

[19:55] <b4252> I installed the dmg from raku.org, I have brew, I think I'll try using its install. I don't want to dig too deep today.

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on a mac I prefer rakubrew

[19:55] <timo> do we have some way to notice when the "macos is preventing us from loading the library for security reasons" thing is happening?

[19:56] <[Coke]> Pretty sure it gives an appropriately crytpic error message.

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just zef install linenoise ...havent got readline to work yet

[19:57] <[Coke]> brew install readline

[19:58] <[Coke]> (I think. Most package managers have a -dev option, but I don't see one for readline on brew)

[19:58] <timo> the -dev one is only needed if the "is native" thing doesn't have a version specified in it

[19:58] <timo> at least normally that's the case

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> brew install rakudo-star looks up to date though be interested to know hiw well that works

[20:00] <b4252> I will tell you in a second. brew updating self, world, installing rakudo-star.

[20:02] *** abraxxa-home joined
[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I just rakubrew download moar-2024.08 then zef install Readline - all very smooth ... brew info readline says  readline: stable 8.2.13 (bottled) [keg-only]

[20:05] *** abraxxa-home left
[20:06] <b4252> maybe i should have used rakubrew; currently upgrading harfbuzz. And some other stuff. Can someone loan me a faster mac?

[20:07] <b4252> I'm not doing the work, brew is.

[20:07] *** abraxxa-home joined
[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve It has been smooth to install Readline ever, and still it is not. I got this message: > On macOS Raku::Readline requires installing Readline via " ~ >             "Homebrew or MacPorts

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> was leave removed at some point? I seem to have missed that

[21:33] <[Coke]> do you mean LEAVE?

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> no

[21:34] <[Coke]> m: leave

[21:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 045644e0a: OUTPUT: «leave not yet implemented. Sorry.␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:34] <[Coke]> That doesn't read like "removed".

[21:34] <[Coke]> bisectable: leave

[21:34] <bisectable6> [Coke], Will bisect the whole range automagically because no endpoints were provided, hang tight

[21:35] <bisectable6> [Coke], Output on all releases: https://gist.github.com/bdb5a46ecf599a7e0be7ccab1b78c096

[21:35] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Well. I don't think it ever got implemented

[21:35] <bisectable6> [Coke], Bisecting by output (old=2017.05 new=2017.06) because on both starting points the exit code is 1

[21:35] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> despecced would be better

[21:36] <[Coke]> if was completely despec'd, I assume we'd want to remove the NYI placeholder.

[21:44] <ab5tract> Not a big fan of routines that have subtle distinctions from phasers

[21:45] <timo> i like leave fine

[21:45] <ab5tract> timo: I guess you mean theoretically

[21:45] <timo> i would like having leave

[21:45] <ab5tract> What’s the fine line for leave vs LEAVE

[21:47] <timo> what's the fine line between NEXT and next

[21:48] <timo> and last and LAST

[21:49] <ab5tract> Good questions. Like I said, I’m not a big fan

[21:54] <ab5tract> For next and last, I see the difference between the “action” and the “phase”

[21:56] <timo> but not for leave?

[21:56] <ab5tract> leave is murkier to me though

[21:57] <timo> enters, computes, refuses to elaborate, leaves.

[21:58] <ab5tract> when I want to “leave” a loop, I call last

[21:58] <ab5tract> When I want to “leave” a block, I call return

[21:59] <timo> well, you can only return from routines, not individual blocks

[21:59] <ab5tract> So yeah, the purpose of leave is unclear to me

[22:01] <timo> but what do you do if you want to "leave" a bloop?

[22:02] <ab5tract> I bloop out of there all in my own :)

[22:02] <ab5tract> Speaking of, it’s time to &sleep

[22:02] <timo> but yeah, leave is for blocks, return goes through multiple blocks like a cannon ball through thin sheets of cardboard

[22:03] <timo> it takes a Routine to stop it, right?

[22:03] <ab5tract> Yeah indeed, it’s late and I mis typed (as in T)

[22:04] <ab5tract> I see the potential now

[22:05] <ab5tract> Though I have also never actually had need for it. But if that were a criteria for CORE, Raku would be a lot less comprehensive than it is

[22:06] <timo> can we already "last" a loop block with a "return value"?

[22:06] <timo> is "next" on a loop body the same as "leave" on a loop body? with a value, i mean

[22:14] <ab5tract> Re: the first question

[22:14] <ab5tract> m: my $x = do for ^3 { last 5 }; dd :$x

[22:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 045644e0a: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Calling last(Int) will never work with any of these multi signatures:␤    ( --> Nil) ␤    (Label:D $x --> Nil)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my $x = do for ^3 { ⏏last 5 }; dd :$x␤»

[22:17] <ab5tract> so yeah, I get it and agree
