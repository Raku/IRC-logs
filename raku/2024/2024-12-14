[00:41] <floyza> I've been defining the WHICH method to use custom classes as keys in sets, but I tried using one of those classes  as a key for a hash, and it acted as though the default WHICH method was being used. What am I doing wrong?

[00:41] <floyza> For example: `class T { has Int $.x; method WHICH() { ValueObjAt.new("T|$!x") } }; my %a = T.new(:x(5)) => 10; say %a{T.new(:x(5))}` returns (Any)

[02:39] <guifa> floyza remember that a Hash is by default typed with Str keys and Any values

[02:41] <guifa> m: class T { has Int $.x; method WHICH() { ValueObjAt.new("T|$!x") } }; my %a{Mu} = T.new(:x(5)) => 10; say %a{T.new(:x(5))}

[02:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 22a5b0ec3: OUTPUT: «10␤»

[02:41] <guifa> make the key Mu (or probs Any too) 

[03:03] <floyza> guifa: Ah, ok. I guess that makes sense. I've been getting confused with typed keys when everything is converted into a string before being used as a key anyways. Thanks a bunch!

[12:17] <tbrowder> hi, i can use "subset X ..." and use test "is-ok $foo, X" to check it, no proplemo

[12:18] <tbrowder> * "isa-ok"

[12:22] <tbrowder> but i want to negate the test to show anothe $bar is not of type X. how?

[12:23] <tbrowder> use cmp-ok? trying that now offline...

[12:41] *** yewscion joined
[12:43] <guifa> you could use nok ($foo.isa: X)

[12:45] <tbrowder> i just used "nok  ($bar ~~ X)" which worked.

[12:45] *** yewscion left
[12:46] <tbrowder> guifa, thanks. i had tried a variant of yr method but couldn't get the syntax right

[12:47] *** hellwolf left
[12:48] <tbrowder> hm, did you mean ".is"?

[12:50] <guifa> probably

[12:50] <guifa> normally ~~ works okay

[12:50] <guifa> but for testing I'd avoid it just in case the right hand has an ACCEPTS method that does osmething funky

[12:51] <tbrowder> m: my $a = 2; nok ($a.isa: Int)

[13:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I my planned Raku Advent post "Chebyshev polynomials and fitting workflows" I have to refer to this issue: https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix/issues/70

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, that is not a "good look" for an advent post?

[13:30] <lizmat> there's quite a few open issues on that repo / module

[13:30] *** yewscion left
[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah...

[13:30] <lizmat> without any response from the author it seems

[13:30] <lizmat> seems author is no longer active at all

[13:31] <lizmat> maybe it's time to fork

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I observe that more and more modules are being adopted by the community - but my concern is that soon we will have unsupported / outdated community modules and will no longer be able to sustain a high quality

[13:32] <lizmat> as a raku community module

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> to solve this, perhaps folks who are interested in the subjest matter should be encouraged to fork, improve and release

[13:32] <lizmat> it seems that you and librasteve are users of it

[13:33] <lizmat> so maybe the two of you should take it on?

[13:33] <lizmat> I'll do the preliminary work of setting up the infra structure

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sounds good. (Although, I am not that willing to deal with "Math::Matrix".)

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Should I write, a Raku advent post on a different subject?

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> as devil's advocate, this sounds like "lets move this module to community and then steve and anton can be earmakred to do the maintenance"

[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> however, I am proposing that "if you have a dependency on a module and find that it is still valuable to your work then you the individual should consider forking it and releasing a ne version under your authorship

[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> "

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube - your new Issue is a new feature request to improve performance - since you are asking for this, perhaps you should consider what it would take for you to make a PR - or make the change in your own fork?

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, I considering, cloning and doing PR.

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw - this is the model I followed with adding fragments to Cro - and now I am a proud member of the Cro maintenance crew

[13:38] <lizmat> ok, I'll do the fork, and look at it to see if there's some easy stuff to be done

[13:39] <lizmat> and then leave it to the community

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sounds good.

[13:39] <lizmat> at least we'll be able to release new versions without having to take full responsibility for the module

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting point!

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok

[13:44] <lizmat> should be there in 30 mins or so

[14:05] <lizmat> meh, there's a fork by lichtkind, but that was never uploaded as such

[14:05] <lizmat> going to ignore that for now

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I am not sure who is the primary developer -- both repositories refere to each other as "a new home."

[14:23] <lizmat> yeah

[14:24] <lizmat> and both worked on it further  :-(

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok, I am bravely continuing writing that fitting/regression Raku Advent blog post.

[14:32] <lizmat> cool!  :-)

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I find it to have too many "nice features." (To me at least.)

[14:33] <lizmat> it definitely has a lot of pod  :-)

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I meant the my post when finished is going to show some "very nice" features. As for "Math::Matrix", I debating how much should I accetuate on its use.

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is this the most "official" reference to the TPRC-2025, or there is a better one? https://www.perl.com/article/get-ready-for-the-2025-perl-and-raku-conference/

[14:54] *** yewscion joined
[14:54] <lizmat> it looks better than the official one  :-)

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Great!

[14:55] <lizmat> antononcube librasteve Math::Matrix 0.4.1 just uploaded to zef

[14:56] <lizmat> sorry it took more than twice as long  :-)

[14:58] <lizmat> issues can now be posted at https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Math-Matrix/issues

[14:59] *** yewscion left
[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 👍

[15:09] <tbrowder> lizmat: i'm still chugging on my too ambitious post.  raku question on subsets: after a successful test of my very complex subsets, they really look and act as regexes. aren't they really named regexes behind the scenes?

[15:09] <lizmat> not unless you use regexes in where clauses afaik

[15:10] <tbrowder> ah, i am using where clauses

[15:11] <tbrowder> i always forget if they are really needed for subsets

[15:12] <tbrowder> but when trying to figure whether to use rx or not, naming the subset seems less confusing

[15:12] <lizmat> not necessarily, but yeah: very often

[15:13] <tbrowder> TIMTOWTDI and love it !

[16:46] <tbrowder> see it now here?

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, yes.

[16:47] <tbrowder> that is a valid Raku class

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 💡 I think you posted that link (or a related) earlier this week, but I missed that it is a class.

[16:48] <tbrowder> with embedded ornaments

[16:49] <tbrowder> i think i posted a bad link--got my years mixed up

[16:50] <tbrowder> with a subtle cross on top

[17:00] *** yewscion left
[17:19] <SmokeMachine> tbrowder: subsets can be used very differently from regex, eg: https://x.com/smokemachine/status/1513284311969157127?s=46

[17:27] <Guest37> This comes from The Weekly Challenge #299, so spoilers ...

[17:27] <Guest37> Gist code here: https://gist.github.com/nd3i/90789f85b4d53f945cc0ca2ab2859095

[17:27] <Guest37> This has to do with building a regex in a string, then using the string as a regex matcher.

[17:27] <Guest37> The base question is: why do #s 1 & 2 work but $3 does not?

[19:55] <lizmat> Guest37: at first sight, that feels like a bug: it appears to be losing the positional capture there

[19:56] <Guest37> Thanks for having a look.

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> what is <|w> ?

[20:08] <tbrowder> smokemachine: that looks pretty handy! i really need to revisit RedORM, maybe in the New Year...

[20:13] <Guest37> <|w> is a word boundary. It restricts the match to the beginning of a word. At least that's my understanding.

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaay - https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Word_boundary ... says <?wb> ... bit confused

[20:16] <timo> i imagine the captured stuff would go in something other than $0

[20:16] <timo> you may have to <blah=$re> and then $<blah> for that?

[20:17] *** Guest37 left
[20:23] *** Sgeo joined
[20:25] <timo> to me, positional captures are "syntactical" at the level of the regex, and a <$foo> interpolation is more like an invocation than literally plopping the regex in your regex in the same position
