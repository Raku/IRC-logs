[15:52] <[Coke]> ‚ûú  ~ zef install Term::termios

[15:52] <[Coke]> ===> Searching for: Term::termios

[15:52] <[Coke]> Must specify a non-empty string as a path

[15:52] <[Coke]> Originally saw this only on Blin, this is on my day to day mac.

[15:54] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/09/10/2024-37-rainbow-highlighting/

[16:16] <ugexe> [Coke]: maybe run zef --help and check whatever file it shows for CONFIGURATION

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Can someone point out to a native-call package / module that uses different C libraries on different operating systems?

[16:19] *** thaewrapt left
[16:23] *** thaewrapt joined
[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Alternatively, I can make just a specific package for the macOS ‚ÄúAccelerate‚Äù library. What would be a good name? ‚ÄúmacOS::Accelerate‚Äù, ‚ÄúMath::Accelerate‚Äù, or just ‚ÄúAccelerate‚Äù ?

[16:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, there is convention to use ‚Äúlib‚Äù in the names of those kind of Raku packages‚Ä¶

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm.... it seems "LibAccelerate" might fit a few packages in raku.land. The things is, I do no want to start developing such a package -- "Accelerate" is huge!

[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is there a simple way to EVAL raku code and capture its stdout into a Str variable (or should I wrap in a Proc::Async)?

[17:00] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Trap

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yep - that'll work nicely - thanks!

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> beautiful

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> Is using ‚ê§ unicode characters when serialising strings a uniquely Raku flourish? Don't think I've seen it anywhere else

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mathematica / Wolfram Language does it. (It has to, in order to do symbolic mathematics.)

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In Mathematica is more complicated than in Raku, though. And it is more prone to breaking when using whatever transfer protocols or mechanisms. (E.g. ZeroMQ.)

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> I thought it seemed like a purely stylistic thing, instead of e.g. the character \ then n

[17:53] *** jaguart left
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> It certainly reads better for human consumption

[17:57] <timo> i think it's specifically a thing the ircbot does

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> I've seen it throughout the examples in the docs and thought surely everyone isn't typing that by hand each time, it must be a systematic thing  üôÇ

[18:24] <[Coke]> having written some of those docs, I almost always cut and paste it, yes.

[18:24] <[Coke]> Or just copy it from the bot output.
