[00:31] <jdv> i find it interesting that codesections asked if anyone wanted to join the grants commitee and i replied and i never heard back after that

[03:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I implemented the Bulgarian numeric word forms generation tonight (in ‚ÄúLingua::NumericWordForms‚Äù.) So, my interest in "Lingua::Number"  is no more than 12%.

[11:22] <tbrowder> fyi, my interest in that link thing, which i haven't tested yet, is how the link to another pod document will render with pdf documents. i need to discuss that with david warring. that may then be worth a small note in the link section.

[11:27] <tbrowder> what i'm looking for is how to "include" a pod document in another. that can be done mechanically with one's own tools. maybe i'm looking for a new formatting code for pod 2.0 to do that

[11:28] <tbrowder> *done now mechanically

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland76: on tables, you may want to look at https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Dan (essentially DataFrames for raku) - don't know if that's any use since dataframes are column oriented and the current implementation is not to type check ...

[11:34] *** haxxelotto left
[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ... that means if you go my \s = Series.new( data => [1, 3, 5, NaN, 6, 8], index => <a b c d e f>, name => 'john' ); say s.dtype;, then it will give back s.data.are; in this case Num....

[11:37] *** thaewrapt left
[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ... the general design idea is to have a pure raku DataFrame than can then be imported into a Pandas or Polars dataframe wholesale.

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> now, if memory serves I did sketch out some ideas on how to wrap up Dan series and dataframes to control types - best examples are https://conf.raku.org/talk/171 at around 17:32

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyway not sure if that is any use at all to your question ... it sounds like Captures are a cool way to do that

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve It seems to me that the package "Data::TypeSystem" can be used to check data-frames column types. Here is a demo -- a tabular dataset is made then it is transposed into a data frame:

[14:04] <tbrowder> when using a JSON::Fast hash key $k with value , say, "0", how can i coerce it to its Int value?

[14:29] <dakkar> `prefix:<+>` is a multi sub, not a method, so you can't call it with the dot

[19:50] <Xliff> Is there a way to have coercion AND a subset?

[19:51] <Xliff> So if I create a subset like so: my subset UBInt of Int where * ~~ 0 .. 255

[19:52] <Xliff> Can I still do "UBInt() $a"?
