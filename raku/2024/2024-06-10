[02:30] <wayland76> My bad about locales.  Seems like we need to see what strftime/strptime do internally, and then mirror some of that.

[11:41] <tbrowder> any suggestions for choosing npm or yarn for graphql work? i lost faith in npm some time ago with a bad experience with rapid npm changes, security, etc., but i might use it again with a new hashnode acct.

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> Not worth going off the beaten track to an unofficial solution. NPM is mature now and works fine

[12:16] <[Coke]> Depending on the concerns, setting up a private npm registry might be worth it to avoid some of your security concerns.

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat The package "JavaScript::Google::Charts" is brand new!!!

[19:05] <lizmat> argh, I guess the version number threw me off the scent  :-)

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (It is not a big tragedy that it is mentioned just as a updated.)

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I had some internal, pre-release versions.

[19:07] <lizmat> updated

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Great, thanks!

[19:07] <lizmat> yw  :-)

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It seems to me that I should have started with Google Charts 1.5 years ago, not with D3.js.

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Then "plots with Raku" might have been a thing by now...

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For whoever is interested in this:  - "JavaScript::D3" is for making plots and charts using intuitive interface. (Suitable for a "simple Raku developer".) - "JavaScript::Google::Charts" is much more adapting to Google Charts (GS), and following GC's workflow design.
