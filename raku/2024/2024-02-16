[00:50] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to thundergnat

[00:51] <[Coke]> same as the other one, i have to hit enter

[01:54] <japhb> Dangit, looks like I keep missing you [Coke] 

[02:00] <japhb> So just from scrollback: Yeah, there are several ways to get raw terminal input, though at this point it's likely that I have produced a rocket-powered warhammer of ridiculousness when you just need something to put in a finishing nail.

[02:03] <japhb> The simplest version I have around is https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/RawInput.pm6

[02:04] *** chemitz left
[02:04] <japhb> It doesn't parse the keys that are sent as escape codes; for that you'd need https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/blob/master/lib/Terminal/Print/DecodedInput.pm6 or better yet to use the more advanced, ANSI-correct stuff I do for Terminal-LineEditor

[05:48] <Voldenet> lizmat: Nice api, and I think multiple dispatch is pointless with most libs using C-style

[05:51] <Voldenet> I'm guessing it would work with cpp libs, but it's probably not worth the effort

[05:54] <Voldenet> especially considering that most useful libs also have C apis

[14:40] <tbrowder__> hi, i'm trying to break down a JSON::Fast hash of stuff and the key -> hash parts work fine. but two chunks are weird and i can't decode it. i'll gist the dd output i got in just a moment...

[14:45] <tbrowder__> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/qMw3qTby/

[14:45] <tbrowder__> i can see 'lat' but can't get its value

[14:46] <lizmat> %data<lat> should do it ?

[14:46] <lizmat> also, you might want to add :immutable to the from-json call

[14:47] <lizmat> that is, if you're not going to change %data

[14:59] <tbrowder__> ok, i'll do that...

[15:01] <tbrowder__> before i get to it, shouldn't File::Temp be a community module? I'll be happy to help, i pushed  PR to 2colour's fork, but...

[15:04] <lizmat> probably

[15:05] <tbrowder__> lizmat: that  worked fine, thank you! (i coulf

[15:37] <[Coke]> japhb: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/37445e5166415909e16050d79c590f4865f46203/examples/decoded-input.p6 was very helpful, thank you

[15:44] <[Coke]> japhb: however, now all my prints are online moving to the next line, not doing a carriage return. Any thoughts?

[15:45] <[Coke]> *only

[15:45] <[Coke]> major change was that I added use Terminal::Print::DecodedInput in a module and added an our $in-supply = decoded-input-supply;

[15:46] <[Coke]> if I manually add \rs it works again. :|

[16:01] <[Coke]> .tell japhb https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/issues/83

[16:01] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to japhb

[16:10] <japhb> [Coke]: Answer in the issue.  Let me know if you need more detail.  :-)

[16:16] *** dakkar joined
[16:16] <[Coke]> japhb: is there a way to use Terminal::Print to switch between raw and not?

[16:23] *** vlad left
[16:24] <[Coke]> eh. I only have a few says, easy enough to wrap. Thanks.

[16:31] <[Coke]> japhb: the input supply seems to take over input for the entire program.

[16:31] <[Coke]> I have some prompt() calls after that, and they are fubar now

[16:32] <[Coke]> I assume I just need to go all in if I'm using Terminal::Print. :(

[16:33] *** vlad joined
[16:33] <[Coke]> (which is fine, was heading there anyway)

[16:37] <japhb> [Coke]: Yes, can close the raw supply and just open a new one when you want it again.

[16:38] <japhb> If you want to be prompting, perhaps you want Terminal::LineEditor?  It uses the newer version of the algorithms in Terminal::Print.  (The newer versions handle a lot more of the full ANSI escape sequence space.)

[16:40] <[Coke]> Supply doesn't have a close.

[16:40] <[Coke]> Ugh.

[16:41] <[Coke]> ok. Setting this aside for now so I don't have to rip out the code I just wrote. :)

[16:43] <japhb> Fair.  Feels like there's (yet another'

[16:43] <japhb> ) Terminal module I need to write.

[16:43] <japhb> *sigh*

[16:53] <[Coke]> eh. not your fault. I started out with something simple that was just printing to the screen and using prompt(), and am slowing making it into something that really wants more features, and I'm just at the steep point right now. no worries.

[16:53] <[Coke]> I probably do want Terminal::Print if I understand it, because this will basically be redrawing the terminal each time to render a game.

[16:53] <[Coke]> and yes I know you have a whole thing for games but that is waaaay too much at this stage. :)
