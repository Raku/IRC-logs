[00:22] <Xliff> I've been asking this for a while, but are there Raku source definitions for GEdit?

[00:27] <[Coke]> I don't think so: https://raku.org/whatever/

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is Raku community's policy for trolling Perl's community over LLM interfacing and usage? Should I LLM-generate a few proposals. (For intensive-, moderate-, and non-trolling.)

[15:30] <lizmat> please, don't troll

[15:30] <lizmat> sorry, can't make any jokes about that  :-(

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok, noted!

[15:50] <ugexe> maybe you could create a working example using https://metacpan.org/pod/Inline::Perl6

[16:16] <lucs> ugexe: I was having a problem obtaining IO::String with zef. Details here: https://gist.github.com/lucs/b073ca892464ef13eda422114117ff70

[16:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugexe I was thinking about using inline Perl5 in Raku. It did not occur to me that the other way around is implemented/facilitated .

[16:23] <ugexe> lucs: because Text::CSV 0.015 included a module called IO::String (see https://github.com/Tux/CSV/commit/348a68c783afdd8150700dd684ed4afd6e8038a9). and raku considers 0.015 > 0.1.1

[16:25] <ugexe> one of these days we'll probably make zef stop considering module names when it searches, but since that has always been how perl6/raku package managers work it'll likely take some effort to fix the fallout from the ecosystem

[16:26] <ugexe> (note that current both distribution names and module names are considered)

[16:30] <lucs> Ah, interesting.

[16:32] <lucs> Should something like that be documented somewhere so poor fools like me don't have to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out what's wrong? :-)

[16:32] <ugexe> To change the behavior would just involve removing the `|| self.provides-spec-matcher($spec, :$strict)` from [here](https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/2ffe30c9947d6bd214ac0ba27658d42636b9aeb8/lib/Zef/Distribution.rakumod#L207), but again that'll potentially break quite a few things in the ecosystem. Those distributions that are broken would ideally be updated to only list distribution names in their

[16:32] <ugexe> META6.json depends instead of module names.

[16:33] <ugexe> i think there are a couple of issues that cover this, although i don't immediately remember where 

[16:35] <ugexe> a Blin run with that zef modification i mention above would probably be sufficient for determining how soon that change could be done, and what we need to update in the ecosystem

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this never loads in mac/safari - seems to work on mac/chrome though
