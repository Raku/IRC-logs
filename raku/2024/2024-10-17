[10:41] <tbrowder> lizmat: think we could make hyperize take another callable to do the work on the hyperized list objects? makes my head hurt but it would really help reduce this user's spaghetti code. approaching making PCs into super computers

[10:42] <lizmat> that's what .map is, no?

[10:51] <tbrowder> ugexe: i appreciate yr position and bow to yr arg. so i will make a linter (and use yr test file). making it a published module, what name would you recommend? something like App::DistroLint or ?

[11:00] <tbrowder> well i've not been very handy with map and don't feel comfy with it yet. i rely on seeing others use it.

[11:02] <tbrowder> lizmat: sorry, last two sentences were for you

[11:02] <tbrowder> at the moment i'm looking at making  a class with TWEAK doing the work

[11:02] <lizmat> my @b = @a.map({ ... })

[11:03] <lizmat> is the same as:

[11:03] <lizmat> my @b = do for @a { ... }

[11:03] <lizmat> does that help in comprehension ?

[11:03] <tbrowder> yes!

[11:03] <tbrowder> thnx

[11:11] <tbrowder> btw, in the docs for yr do example it shows equiv my $b = do for @a {...}. confusing for noobs (even though it shows (...) as result

[11:14] <tbrowder> i think that is why Todd is often unhappy with the docs, and i also. i have alway disliked the super terse form of man pages.

[11:14] <tbrowder> most man pages that is.

[11:16] <tbrowder> imho, too much golfing in docs

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: I am not sure that it is fair to say there is too much, or indeed any, golfing in the raku docs. To my mind that would involve code examples that are chosen for there terseness rather than their explanatory power. I would like to think that the examples in the raku docs are chosen because of their explanatory power. In many places, I do agree that the examples are "obscure". However I believe that the

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> style of the raku docs is to have examples of the corner cases of the usage of features to show the breadth of what can be written (rather than aiming to show "one true way") and by way of this to explain the underlying rationale for the feature and its combinations.

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> There is also some jokiness, which I like, but may not suit all readers.

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> The raku docs are often too deep too soon for beginners and I would always suggest the raku.guide to beginners and to those who want to have a limited exposure to the fancier features.

[13:14] <[Coke]> We should probably also have an intro section in the official docs, but we barely have any authors.

[13:43] <tbrowder> Yes, not fair. I do forget about the guide. Would be helpful for it to be in nice PDF form.

[13:43] *** Sgeo joined
[13:46] <tbrowder> librasteve: need yr review of roast PR #865 (adds yr input to log2 tests)

[13:53] <tbrowder> [Coke]: one thing stopping contributing to an intro is figuring out how to get it into the current docs work flow. maybe you could start an intro and mention the raku.guide

[13:53] <tbrowder> (as a WIP)

[14:24] <tbrowder> ah, rakuguide has pdf capability

[14:27] <tbrowder> [Coke]  what are your thoughts on providing a current pdf version on github/raku with a link to it in the new intro?

[14:27] <tbrowder> i will produce the pdf…

[14:28] <tbrowder> if no other vols

[14:45] <[Coke]> I don't have anything to do with raku.guide.

[14:45] <[Coke]> Sorry

[14:46] <[Coke]> Or do you mean adding an intro to raku/docs?

[14:46] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/ has The Raku Guide linked on the main page

[15:04] *** MoC left
[15:14] <tbrowder> yes, i will create the pdf version and put it somewhere in or under doc. yr TWO links should point to the online  ver as well as the pdf version i will make according to the auth’s instructions. later we can automate the construction to keep pdf updated with source.

[15:15] <tbrowder> is that ok with you?

[15:15] <tbrowder> afk& for a while…

[15:48] <[Coke]> I don't understand what you're asking

[15:49] <[Coke]> If you mean create a PDF of raku.guide - that's not me.

[15:49] <[Coke]> if you mean something else, let me know?

[15:54] <[Coke]> if you mean create a PDF of raku/doc - there is an effort for an ebook, would that be sufficient/overlapping?

[15:55] <[Coke]> but in general, more ways to consume docs++

[16:03] *** ab5tract left
[16:18] <tbrowder> the existing “introduction” then needs a “foreword” section, a MUCH shorter chunk on top of the current page

[16:19] <tbrowder> sort of like an intro para or chapter in a book.

[16:22] <tbrowder> aren”t the current depiction of docs  online sort of interim? otherwise i would be suggesting problems.

[16:22] <tbrowder> afk for a while…

[16:25] <[Coke]> ?

[16:25] <[Coke]> "sort of interim" ?

[16:25] <[Coke]> I don't understand.

[16:48] <tbrowder> i guess my memory has deserted me, but then…time flies…forget that comment.

[16:49] <tbrowder> so, can’t we add a short lead-in section?

[16:53] <tbrowder> in the meantime, if i’ve offended anyone about anything forgive me. i love raku and you folks. my days are numbered, my memory is fading, and my todo list is longer than i can keep up with.

[16:54] <tbrowder> and i’m getting grumpier…

[17:20] <[Coke]> yes, we can add a short lead in section

[17:20] <[Coke]> your ask was unclear, as you started out with raku.guide and pdf comments.

[17:21] <[Coke]> I'm not saying no, I'm trying to just clarify what your ask is.

[17:22] <[Coke]> adding more content on the intro page? sounds great, actually

[17:32] <timo> i'm wondering if maybe some asciinema recordings could be attractive and maybe even helpful? though for code, i'm not sure it does much more than just a copypaste of an interactive session's output or something like that

[17:35] <[Coke]> something like what's on raku.org main page?

[17:35] <[Coke]> oh, but more so, I guess.

[17:36] <[Coke]> I would say let's get that on the raku.org main page and replace the code samples there.

[17:36] <[Coke]> We might want to add something like that in like intro/ page on raku/docs, but I'm guessing not on every page.

[17:38] *** stanrifkin joined
[17:39] <tbrowder> oh i know that coke. and these msgs seem to intersperse out of order sometime which doesn’t help

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i just got back from a trip … the raku eBook was essential on the flight … it worked well for me

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: sorry my comments in code golf were a bit grumpy too … don’t mean to be negative … there is much work to do

[17:40] <tbrowder> amen!

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the topic of raku.org, my personal aim is to rewrite the site in Cro …. a lot of the recent Cro related blogging has been to get me ramped in Cro to do a fair job

[17:42] <tbrowder> librasteve: what do you use to read ebooks?

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> very happy to collaborate if others want to join

[17:42] * [Coke] hasn't used an ereader in years, but is himself a grumpy old man.

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes - calibre is it

[20:13] <coleman> calibre is great. looks a little funky but it's solid 

[20:25] <timo> it does a whole boatload of stuff, too

[20:26] <timo> remember when there was a large amount of attention on calibre for the piece that's built into it that handles automatic mounting of usb drives or something?

[20:27] <stanrifkin> What alternatives are there to read epub and stuff?

[20:27] <stanrifkin> I think on Windows SumatraPDF can read epub

[20:27] <timo> i've read a few epubs/ebooks with Okular

[20:28] <timo> i wanted to check if foxit has any support for epub or so, and immediately i'm presented with AI features again

[20:32] *** ab5tract joined
[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I dont mind AI gen stuff in general but I wish it stayed out of editors ;_;

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> working in a privacy sensitive sector that stuff is a minefield

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> gonna have to switch to lojban meets klingon function names just to prevent someone else adding it to some LLM x]

[20:47] <ab5tract> at least Raku opens up the vast wealth of unicode characters to support such efforts :)

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> as if dodging MIT licenses wasnt enough

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well, not just at least; it's why I use Raku now lol

[20:52] <ab5tract> haha

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> pays well at least but I've been going through 1.5 years of audit wrt code/legal/license review for software that took only a month to write so... haha ;_;

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wonders about licences - we have the tradition to use Artistic 2.0 here ... but as perl declines, so I worry that there is no longer attention on licence evolution - what are the pros / cons vs. MIT (or is there a better one like GPL 3 or copyleft)?

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well GPL has a EUPL equivalent

[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> which is important because it means it is translated for every country's official language

[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> meaning LESS lawyering

[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> theres variations of MIT around that ask you to put attribution but they never specify where

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> you dont want to sit in a court where English is not the main language but the license the software is under is 🙂

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> lawyers make good money off of that

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> the EUPL having translations that take precedence over GPL while remaining the same in protection of end-user freedom means you can relicense it between them

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> the artistic license has never been brought up in my years of bureacracy at least

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> as a sticking point whereas MIT has :/

[21:33] <tbrowder> any good iPad readers for eBooks? most of the ones i've looked at don't have great reviews or are not real readers,but ymmv.

[21:39] <[Coke]> (attribution) - for a project i'm on, we have to put the attribution in the about somewhere for user-fascing stuff, and in a readme in  deployed container for all backend stuff

[21:40] <[Coke]> i think legal team assumes overkill is best.

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so Arend in a non legal advice context would it make more sense for folks publishing a raku module to use MIT instead of Artistic?

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> you can use MIT just fine

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so should I cahnge all my Artistic to MIT?

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I dont see why you would

[21:48] <[Coke]> GPL is a non-starter for any commercial project I've ever been on, fwiw.

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> 👍

[21:48] <[Coke]> (as is CC)

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Artistic can change into GPL and EUPL

[21:49] <[Coke]> Artistic is rarer than MIT, but I've not heard any legal issues with it.

[21:49] <[Coke]> artistic 1.0 can

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> and GNU says EUPL is ¨dangerous" I think because it allows for more relicensing but it doesnt really account for ¨spirit of the law"

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my fear is that artistic may also be a non-starter in the same weay

[21:49] <[Coke]> Artistic 2.0 and 1.0 are not the same.

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> all my stuff 2.0

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> never heard any consultant complaining about it

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe this is a benefit of obscurity

[21:51] <[Coke]> I've had it reviewed by the legal team at $DAYJOB, for what it's worth.

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cool

[21:51] <[Coke]> (for use in a commercial app)

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> can you share the outcome?

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> ye I dont work in the commercial sector so theres another difference as well

[21:53] <[Coke]> it was approved, no concerns, just continue to list attribution.

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx

[21:53] <tellable6> 2024-10-17T21:52:15Z #raku-dev <tbrowder> librasteve when you get some spare time, please review rakudo roast PR #865

[21:53] <[Coke]> Yup, definitely different considerations. 

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Dutch and working in the physical/mental health industry

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but the biggest danger there is other suits really 😛

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> kudos - hopefully not as messed up as the NHS

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: can you let me have a link?

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> pls

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> the reason MIT was tough is because sometimes you have clients that cant read or have any understanding what their rights are if $COMPANY goes bankrupt

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but this gets solved through legal overkill as said

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> aside: I did a deal with SAP and EMC a few years back ... one aspect of the contracts was to put their IP lawyer and our IP lawyer on the conf call (with bad connection, one german guy, our chinese-american guy working from home with a screaming baby) .... and ... just lawyer <=> lawyer speak ... they took 3 mins to agree (at $1000/hr), most was just peacocking their encyclopaedic legal knowledge

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> hehe, we were okay with the lawyers until a consultant took home close to 100k euro at the end of the whole ordeal; since then family's get folders, USB drives, access to online platforms etc

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> you learn the lesson once 😛

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I wonder how one gets such a cushy job where you dont actually do any of the work except drive around to meetings and are still technically in "IT" ;_; maybe as a blockchain expert

[22:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nah - cybersecurity

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> I guess thats ever changing
