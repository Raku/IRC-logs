[10:20] <Xliff> librasteve: "six"?

[10:20] <Xliff> And your welcome.

[10:21] <Xliff> I'd like to release it to the ecosystem, but there's a ways to go. I should commit all of the dependencies first. Hopefullt by end of day.

[20:52] <patrickb> https://github.com/sergot/io-socket-ssl/pull/24 <-- This is the IO::Socket::SSL as a wrapper around IO::Socket::Async::SSL rewrite.

[20:53] <patrickb> As this module is used in quite some parts of the ecosystem, I'd like to get some testing (maybe even a Blin?) before this is merged. I'll do some more testing with my own software using it and report back.

[22:37] <japhb> vrurg_: Why was JSON::Class 0.0.6 never released?

[22:38] <japhb> Also, JSON::Class requires minimum Rakudo 2023.12.  Are there Docker containers built for actual releases (as opposed to nightly builds) for anything newer than 2023.08?

[22:38] <vrurg_> japhb: because it's the current developement version.

[22:39] <japhb> Oh, you did a bump commit but didn't actually release, gotcha.

[22:39] <vrurg_> Yep. Got tired messing up with version, switched to early bump cycle.

[22:39] <japhb> Do you use mi6?

[22:40] <vrurg_> No. It doesn't do all what I want it to. Use my own Makefile-based git submodule.

[22:40] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg

[22:41] <japhb> Ah, gotcha.  Yeah, a while back it finally reached my personal minimum threshold, and I was happy to stop worrying about version bump mistakes.  :-)

[22:42] <vrurg> I will never reach my personal minimum until it gets a plugin system, as Perl's diszilla has.

[22:42] * japhb considers whether to do his own Rakudo Docker containers

[22:44] <vrurg> For example, my document generation script alone is 35K in size and allows me to use something like TYPE<Int> to insert direct references to Raku docs. And translates L<C<Mod::Name>> into a link to the module, depending on wether its part of the project or external.

[22:44] <japhb> Dist::Zilla was nice indeed

[22:44] <japhb> Wowsers

[22:46] <vrurg> Creating own build systems is my curse. This is exactly what I do right now for a new Rust project. :)

[22:49] <japhb> OOF

[22:49] <japhb> I try to limit that to only every few years.

[22:49] <japhb> Otherwise the yak shaving would truly never end ....

[22:57] <leont> Yeah, I've been tempting to write one of my own. Having done it before is what keeps me from it.

[22:58] <leont> I'd probably have to start with extracting a bunch of existing mi6 logic into its own modules so it's reusable (e.g. version handling)
