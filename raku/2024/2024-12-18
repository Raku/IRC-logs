[11:29] <tbrowder> lizmat: can we use the "Ultimate Markdown" plug in with our raku-advent site?

[11:30] <lizmat> no, I'm afraid not

[11:30] <lizmat> but if you have a post in markdown, I can put that into WP for you

[11:30] <tbrowder> even a paid version?

[11:31] <lizmat> the raku advent site is currently free

[11:34] <lizmat> and I don't want to take on any financial obligations for it, as going back from it will probably be near impossible

[11:36] <tbrowder> hm...bummer, the old one-way content scam...

[11:38] <tbrowder> i'll take you up on that, if you'll let me buy you a beer in Greenville...

[11:38] <lizmat> for sure! 

[11:39] <tbrowder> not quite ready, but getting there

[11:40] <lizmat> good to hear... just privmsg / email  me the gist

[11:40] <lizmat> of the markdown

[11:44] <tbrowder> wilco

[14:06] <jdv> who is doing the advent thing?

[14:06] <jdv> looks like day 17 might be missing from the 24 cat

[14:06] <jdv> https://raku-advent.blog/category/2024/

[14:07] <jdv> also, why is the 23 cat link on, and/or why is the 24 cat link not on, the front page?

[14:08] <lizmat> jdv: I am

[14:09] <lizmat> fixed 1, the 24 cat link will be on after dec 25

[14:09] <lizmat> afk&

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: fwiw I was thinking of making a WP plugin raku syntax highlighter for the advent calendar a couple of months ago due to the manual nature of achieving raku syntax highlighting via gist (huh?) - initially my idea for this was to use Rainbow (afaik a raku highlighter - or at least parser) written in raku

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but - the wider picture was (i) I ran out of time, (ii) it would need a paid subscription to wordpress.com for the advent calendar site and (iii) it would not have worked anyway since I am sure you cannot install raku on a hosted WP instance on wordpress.com ;-(

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> given a bit more runway (which we willl have in scads comes 1st Jan), I would have proposed something like an AWS EC-2 instance (like this https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/CLI::AWS::EC2-Simple) with a full WP source install (like this https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/CLI::Wordpress) where we could export / import all the content on wordpress.com advent cal site and run some raku. My expectation is that this would

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> need t3.small ($20 / month) or t3.medium ($40/month) so that is a real cost.

[14:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or we could do this on any hosted ubuntu LTS server instance with a fixed IP address if anyone can donate one

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbh this would be a bit of a hassle and wordpress.com does provide a robust and scalable (at our traffic levels) capability

[14:43] <timo> i would much prefer something like a simple-to-use raku script that uses rainbow to make highlighting, so we don't have to spend money on something every month, and we don't have to manually go through gists

[14:43] *** finanalyst joined
[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: I agree that that would be a big improvement

[14:44] <timo> also, there's a raku infra team who are taking care of hosting some things. i would refer to them for the decision of what kind of machine the raku advent should be hosted on

[14:45] <timo> and if we can, i'd nope away from wordpress. i've run my own blog on ghost a long time ago, it wasn't bad. we don't need the full power of wordpress to turn our website into literally anything just by downloading a plugin or two

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> a lot of these ideas were so I could play with Rainbow - eg for use on a Cro based rakudoc site

[14:45] <timo> did you already look at how the current doc site uses rainbow?

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not yet - my path is (i) get to the point where I can build a website on Cro the right way (see yesterday's post ;-), (ii) build a static site example that could be a new design for raku.org and then offer it to the team, (iii) add htmx based edit / preview to certain pages for admin (like the current rakudoc site), with raku syntax highlighting with Rainbow and (iv) do something similar for markdown

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I look forward to stealing the design from the current (or v2) doc site

[15:01] <timo> ah, so you would also want highlighting to work in the browser as you're typing?

[15:02] <timo> i wonder if rainbow is simple enough to work with perlito6 which hasn't been updated in a long long time

[15:04] <jdv> lizmat: thanks

[15:37] <jdv> lizmat: the reason the 24 cat is interesting to me is that i tend to like to look at the list of posts every few days and the main page only shows the last couple posts

[15:37] * jdv is a picky binger

[15:38] <lizmat> at the bottom of each post, there's a "previous" link

[15:38] <jdv> yeah i know.  that requires a lot of scrolling without summary.  its all good.

[15:40] <jdv> are we gonna get a historical like video like randal did for perl for raku?

[15:40] <jdv> i haven't seen it yet.  just sounded neat.

[15:40] <lizmat> I haven't seen it

[15:41] <jdv> the claim is it'll be part of hte perl advent calendar once its ready

[15:43] * jdv just realized next xmas (25) it'll be 10y - time flies

[15:50] <[Coke]> Is the randal thing old? Last I saw of him, he was not working in perl anymore.

[15:52] <jdv> it was a zoom thing on 12/14

[15:53] <jdv> oalders says hes just waiting on randal's approval before its posted

[15:53] <jdv> https://lu.ma/giz69577

[16:06] <[Coke]> nice.

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: highlighting when typing sounds lovely but the core need for me would be to do like gh markdown does … with highlighting for (static) preview in a tab and on the published page…

[21:38] <ab5tract> There was a font recently that embeds a bunch of different colors so that you can theoretically do syntax highlighting https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/

[21:38] <ab5tract> Without JS or CSS

[21:39] <ab5tract> I’ve been meaning to look into whether it can be combined with Rainbow

[22:31] <guifa> ab5tract that's pretty insane

[22:31] <guifa> I've done some really crazy things with font tables before but that definitely takes the cake
