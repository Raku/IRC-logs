[10:04] <melezhik> I am looking for Raku module to build distribution gist / graphics - pseudo graphic / ascii graphic is ok

[10:05] <melezhik> so I have time series data and I need to draw a simple plot

[10:05] <melezhik> to show me distribution

[10:05] <melezhik> nothing fancy

[10:05] <melezhik> any thoughts ?

[11:06] <tbrowder> melezhik: hi, have you tried searcing raku.land with some key words?

[11:06] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[11:10] <tbrowder> i need to find if 2 strings share at least one char. i know i can loop through one word with .comb and use .contains on the other, but i think lizmat has shown some fancy set methods that are classier.

[11:11] <tadzik> tellable6++, what a tech :)

[11:18] <tbrowder> ah, set intersection & seems to be the operator

[11:20] <tbrowder> m: my $a = "abc"; my $b = "cde"; say ($a.comb & $b.comb).elems

[11:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 735fc4f3d: OUTPUT: ¬´all(3, 3)‚ê§¬ª

[11:20] <lizmat> m: dd "abc".comb (&) "cde".comb

[11:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 735fc4f3d: OUTPUT: ¬´Set.new("c")‚ê§¬ª

[11:21] <tbrowder> lizmat: thank you!

[11:23] <tbrowder> i noticed the parens in the docs but ignored them :(

[11:23] <lizmat> an approach in which you create a Set of the longest string and then do a loop with (elem) on the letters of the other, would probably be more efficient

[11:26] <tbrowder> okey dokey, but all i care about for now is truthy if any char is shared with very short strings

[11:27] <tbrowder> in my csv module i can't have line endings and sep chars sharing any char

[11:29] <lizmat> m: dd ?("abc".comb (&) "cde".comb)

[11:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 735fc4f3d: OUTPUT: ¬´Bool::True‚ê§¬ª

[11:29] <lizmat> m: dd ?("abc".comb (&) "def".comb)

[11:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 735fc4f3d: OUTPUT: ¬´Bool::False‚ê§¬ª

[11:30] <tbrowder> at least with my simple approach

[11:31] <tbrowder> and the leading ? is same as using .so, yes?

[11:31] <lizmat> yup

[15:56] <tbrowder> melezhik: i think one of the raku advents discussed a terminal prog of some kind

[16:09] <tbrowder> what's the easiest way to create an identical alias for sub X so that calling sub Y with the same args will return the same result?

[16:14] <tbrowder> melezhik: Terminal::Graphing::BarCharts may be a starting point

[16:14] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[16:42] <lizmat> tbrowder ^^

[16:49] <rir_> "raku --profile-filename=name" gives a deprecation notice.  But seems to already be deprecated as 'name' is not created.

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub a($x) {$x¬≤}; my &b := &a; say b(2)

[17:16] <tbrowder> ok, for use in a module i added "is export(:foo)" and put that line following the real sub's def and all is well. i didn't need the ':=', '=' worked fine. i also didn't use the "my".

[17:16] <tbrowder> rockin and rollin...
