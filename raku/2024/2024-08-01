[01:05] <coleman> Built a container w/ librasteve's fix. Deploying now. Maybe a little downtime on cro.raku.org incoming

[01:23] <coleman> should be back https://cro.raku.org/docs/intro/spa-with-cro

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> coleman: thanks!

[11:41] <El_Che> antononcube: mmm

[11:46] <El_Che> coleman: isn't a container easier to build just using packages (OS or rakudo-pkg), eg alpine?

[13:41] <coleman> probably. I haven't tried to optimize the build yet.

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I still do not see "2024.07" at rakudo.org. Is that expected?

[18:28] <El_Che> antononcube: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2024.07 (dunno if useful to you)

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> El_Che Yeah, I saw that when it was announced two days ago.

[18:31] <patrickb> antoncube: I'm responsible for the builds on rakudo.org (and subsequently those in rakubrew). They are not there yet, as I've been away from home for a week (ending tomorrow) and my solution to start my home computer remotely failed (again, argh!)

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb Ok, thank you for the update! (And sorry for being pushy...)

[18:45] <patrickb> No worries!

[21:52] <ab5tract> Today I had the opportunity to write a Raku script at $work that filled a crucial gap (initiating batches of Athena queries for a dataset that’s too large to query more than one day at a time)

[21:53] <ab5tract> Looking forward to comparing the costs of doing it this way versus the “right” way of using a Python notebook and Spark

[21:54] <ab5tract> And generally feeling really grateful for all the work that’s been put into this little big language of ours :)

[22:03] <lizmat> :-)
