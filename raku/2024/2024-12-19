[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Has anyone worked on programs / apps that cheat employee monitoring software?

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Or the other way around -- has anyone worked on employee monitoring software?

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Preferably, using Raku.

[14:57] <lizmat> TIL there's such a thing

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ðŸ™‚ Here is relevant discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1gy7lma/employee_monitoring_software_has_gone_off_the/?rdt=54750

[15:20] <El_Che> antononcube: in the old days, I just wrote a small mouse randomizer. Nowadays I say fuck it, and install Linux :)

[15:20] <El_Che> no idea how I get away with it for decades in different places 

[15:20] *** vrurg left
[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is most likely illegal in EU. (If you live in EU...)

[15:21] <El_Che> it was used in the old days

[15:21] <El_Che> but not as extreme as in the link

[15:21] <El_Che> mostly something that recorde inactivities

[15:21] <El_Che> d

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, to quote Fat Boy Slim: >  If you walk without rhythm, you wonâ€™t attract the worm.

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @EL_Che In what language did you write that? (Perl?)

[15:24] <El_Che> java, there was some basic windowmanager integration, like moving the mouse and get the resolution. It was trivial

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a need for two agents: (i) a employee minitor and (ii) a cheater.

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Otherwise, the cheater agent might get too easily detected by the monitoring software.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To rephrase: > The AI I made for doing my work is going to be monitored by another AI .

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> I wonder with those web CAPTCHAs that ask you to do nothing more than click a checkbox or drag something to the right, is it looking for human-like mouse cursor movement

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> They might be! I strongly suspect they deliberate put images they do not know about in order to get human classifications. And/or cross-validation of their ML algorithms.

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: I think that employee monitoring was one of the main features of Crowdstrike AV software btw

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I should have advent-blogged about data obfuscation (with Raku.)

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> From Machine Learning perspective.

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anti AI monitoring agents that use AI - now that's a real use case for AI

[18:05] <Geth> Â¦ advent/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/advent/commit/82003fbb2f

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have this "old" REPL code:  $!compiler := nqp::getcomp("Raku") || nqp::getcomp('perl6'); $!repl = REPL.new($!compiler, {}); 

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> How should I change it in order not to get the error: "Invalid REPL environment: Unable to initialize REPL outside of a TTY" ?

[19:21] <ab5tract> antononcube: checking

[19:21] <lizmat> ab5tract might know

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That question is in relation the the issue of "Jupyter::Chatbook" reported here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5726

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I tried to figure out what to do looking at the code here: https://github.com/lizmat/REPL

[19:23] <ab5tract> one option is to have whatever code is starting the Raku process include `--repl-mode=process`

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I just tried:  $!repl = REPL.new($!compiler, {}, try-mode => 'process'); 

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Will try that suggestion now...

[19:25] <ab5tract> it needs to be set in the compiler already (as currently implemented)

[19:26] <ab5tract> antononcube: keep in mind that I'm not sure what the approach should be for when changes to Rakudo internals breaks user-space modules that are opting to use nqp

[19:27] <ab5tract> as it's not really a bug per se when things change on layers where fewer/no guarantees are made

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, this should be a problem with "Jupyter::Kernel" too. I will verify that it is and file an issue. (For Brian Duggan to figure out. ðŸ™‚ )

[19:29] <ab5tract> Wherever the original "start the raku process" is happening is where the `--tty-mode=process` needs to be added

[19:29] <ab5tract> as that's a setting in the compiler object that you are retrieving via `nqp::getcomp`

[19:30] <ab5tract> you might be able to get away with just creating a new compiler object :)

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, I cannot figure it out, for now. I have to postpone the investigation for later this week / month.
