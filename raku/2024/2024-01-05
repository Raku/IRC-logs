[18:11] <tonyo> librasteve antoncube, fwiw i generally use the python libs for scraping.  the perl one has some issues, or did when i was using it to scrape google flights prices

[18:35] <jdv> mojo hasbeen good for me for static scrapes

[19:53] <tonyo> static scrapes i just use perl's web::scraper

[19:53] <tonyo> or rakus, but it's pretty rare for me to scrape static pages

[19:54] <tonyo> in fact, since i wrote raku's 

[19:54] *** gdown joined
[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah, which python scraper do your prefer?

[20:05] <tonyo> i use selenium with python

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okay - tx!

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [meaning I have been going that way myself so may be able to work up raku-selenium]

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> which driver do you use?

[20:11] <tonyo> i use the chrome driver, have also used FF but i use FF personally so i try to use chrome to avoid any mix of the two

[20:11] <tonyo> use FF personally for regular web browsing

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo I cannot install "Web::Scraper" on macOS. (Installation hangs.) Should file an issue on GitHub?

[20:40] <[Coke]> I think the hang might be due to the old URLS in t/02_http.t

[20:41] <[Coke]> oh, sorry, we're not pulling those from the web, but from another file

[20:42] <[Coke]> it's hanging on the scrape() call

[20:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Thanks!

[20:53] <tonyo> yea it might just take a really long time, yea you can add an issue and i'll take a look when i have time

[20:56] *** jpn left
[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ok

[21:02] <[Coke]> I started one running with a timer and we'll see.

[21:02] <[Coke]> (I'm on an m2 here.)

[21:03] <[Coke]> it is chewing a single CPU, so something's happening

[21:49] <tonyo> iirc the html normalzation takes a while

[21:49] <tonyo> it's likely due for an overhaul now that libxml bindings exist
