[08:44] <timo> librasteve, i'm looking at your R#4852 right now. the problem you're having is actually in the line that it's pointing you at: you're trying to set `dtype => ::($_.dtype)` and from the error message it looks like $_.dtype.Str results in `<class 'numpy.int64'>`. i imagine that's the result of the rs_dtype method from the python class RakuSeries? that's where it does `str(self.series.dtype.type)` which

[08:44] <linkable6> R#4852 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4852 WARNING: unhandled Failure detected in DESTROY. No such symbol '<class 'numpy.int64'>'

[08:44] <timo> is surely not what you want. also, you don't seem to be doing anything with the dtype parameter, so the Failure you're passing from the failed ::(...) lookup is just dropped on the floor where the GC later picks it up and warns you that you probably meant not to do that

[08:48] *** ant left
[09:06] <timo> grondilu, you have some golfed code in the same issue. yours can work by putting a .self after the .pred and .succ in the up/down/left/right methods. .self on a Failure will throw it, which the try you're using will then be able to catch, and the Failure will properly be marked as handled. I think there may be a rakudo or language issue there that wants to be fixed

[09:07] <timo> more importantly, .self on a non-Failure is a pass-through

[09:07] *** Chanakan left
[09:07] <timo> you can also put "use fatal;" at the start of each of these methods instead of using .self

[09:32] *** Chanakan joined
[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: thanks for the help - I guess I need to be more careful about stuff I pass to ::($name) Happy to go fix my own code and (for you) to close this issue.

[12:01] <m6locks> hi, is anyone able to rakubrew build jvm at all? I got 64G ram with no limits but still out of memory error https://dpaste.org/uJTZL#L6,13

[12:04] <timo> m6locks: you may need to give the jvm an extra argument from the -Xm series to allow it use more memory for its heap?

[12:04] <timo> i only see -Xms8m which i think means "starting heap size 8 megabytes" and does not change much for this process

[12:04] <m6locks> but it's built with rakubrew, does rakubrew pass that argument?

[12:07] <timo> hm, i guess not? i'll also have a look.

[12:07] <m6locks> thanks

[12:13] <timo> whew, this takes a while

[12:14] <m6locks> no prob, I've got a functioning release otherwise

[12:18] <timo> anything in particular you want to do with rakudo-jvm?

[12:20] <timo> huh, this is a javac process that's asploding, not like an nqp-j or rakudo-j invocation?

[15:47] <Xliff> 2 bugs, then?

[15:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i think the first one is a bug but by second if you meant my @a; say (@a //= (1, 2)) giving [], that seems correct because (my @a).defined is True, it is only empty, so, e.g., ||= would assign [1, 2] fine

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> first one also errors for || and && but not %%, so maybe short-circuiting is suspicious

[16:00] <rjbs> Very often, when I open iTerm, there is a noticeable (multi-second) delay during which it is running rakubrew.  I think it's doing zsh completion stuff.

[16:00] <rjbs> Anybody else have this problem, or know the solution to it?

[16:16] <[Coke]> It seems quick here. (mac m2)

[16:53] *** dakkar left
[17:41] <ab5tract> seems pretty quick for me, but I don't specifically bother with completion setup. if it's included by default, I guess I'm not noticing a delay.

[17:58] <[Coke]> I am also using zsh, fwiw.

[17:59] <[Coke]> rjbs: https://gist.github.com/coke/9ef61029003c911d1642e666c93af677

[17:59] <[Coke]> If we want to compare versions.

[18:00] <rjbs> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/91ZihTW7/

[18:00] <rjbs> I wonder if it's going to be something like "rjbs has ancient zsh autocomp helper code somewhere" üòï

[18:01] <rjbs> thing is, I think if I remove rakubrew, nothing else will be slow; maybe I do that soon, since I need to step away for a while

[18:04] <[Coke]> I'll upgrade rakubrew...

[18:05] <[Coke]> done - will spawn a window... later.

[18:05] <[Coke]> worth testing.

[18:47] <Xliff> Does anyone here have any experience with Cro::Router?

[19:01] <Xliff> antoncube: Oh nice. Do you have anything on a public repo I can look at?

[19:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, sure, but it is somewhat complicated: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-DSL-Translators/blob/main/bin/dsl-web-translation-service

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, the GitHub code is not that complicated but it might not be very clear what is its purpose.

[20:02] <Xliff> librasteve: Actually, I took a look at HTMX-Examples earlier this week. Nice work!

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Thanks for the feedback - there's a lot of web dev nonsense going on right now (tailwind, flowbite and so on) that just pollutes the HTML - so I wanted to get back to basics - and react (etc) is overkill for what I want

[20:11] <Xliff> Same here. I have an application server in Raku I hope to release soon.

[20:11] <Xliff> It's straight MVC, using Cro::WebApp::Template which is nice... and not so nice for HTML.

[20:12] <Xliff> I am working on making the use of angle brackets configurable.

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sounds cool

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am working on doing an "elm slang" for raku ... the discussion issue https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples/issues/1 has a short example of my goal for functional style to make html ... since that is very popular with elm ... but in that case in the browser and compiling to ECMAScript, whereas the "right" place is on the server

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Does this mean that one would be able to configure the angle brackets to be round?

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also you can see the synopsis at https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTML-Functional

[20:20] <Xliff> antoncube: What? You mean ()?

[20:20] <Xliff> Also not wise since parentheticals are used quite often.

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Yes. üôÇ

[20:20] <Xliff> But I don't see why not.

[20:21] <Xliff> (?.a)<span>Hey! A was truthful!(/?)

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was joking, because it was not clear "angle brackets" being configurable means.

[20:21] <Xliff> (D'oh! no </span>)

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> h1("Welcome to Dunder Mifflin!"),    <== this is functional

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Makes me think of "programmable comma."

[20:22] <Xliff> antoncube: Currently template tags are angle brackets. The previous example rewritten to the current spec is:

[20:22] <Xliff> <?.a><span>Hey! A was truthful!</span></?>

[20:22] <Xliff> Which looks too much like HTML for me to see the difference between them.

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> h1 "Welcome to Dunder Mifflin!",    <== so is this courtesy of raku syntax

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> a span "Hey! A was truthful!"

[20:24] <Xliff> would "p span Bueller!" do as expected?

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (not sure about the ?)

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> p span "Bueller!" 

[20:24] <Xliff> Yeah.

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> all the tags are exported as subroutines

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so -yes

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also you can use raku pair notation for attrs...

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Ok, it seems your confguring angular brackets in / for "Cro::WebApp::Template".
