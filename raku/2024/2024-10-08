[10:55] <ab5tract> New comma beta released this morning. It removes the old SDK integration entirely, so you may be once again prompted for an SDK ‚Äî but this should really be the last time!

[10:57] <ab5tract> Another highlight is that ctrl/ cmd clicking on an external package name should seamlessly load that package in a file ‚Äî assuming that the distribution that provides it is installed.

[10:57] <ab5tract> Accessing the same via the External Libraries tree should also Just Work.

[10:59] <ab5tract> I‚Äôd appreciate some feedback on the external libraries mechanism. Right now you get a flat list of all provided packages from the distribution. Is this fine? Or should I recreate the directory structure of the package instead?

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I know of several related jokes. üôÇ

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nijmegenzuigt Are you, by any chance, using TOML configurations?

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> never

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> prefer gura if I do have to make config files

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there a Raku package handling Gura specs?

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Meaning, I do not see such package in raku.land, but otherwise one might exist. (Or three.)

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Gura seems to compare itself with TOML.

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Gura is good because it gets me out of the JSON/YAML/TOML discussion üôÇ

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but Gura itself obv has some funny stuff

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am looking for making a new grammar "from scratch" for a conference talk. I was thinking to use TOML, but I might use Gura instead.

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> used it once with ZMQ and felt way better than JSON

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> tbh it's pretty clean

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Gura is "potentially" slower but look ath ow much garbage JSON is being passed around either way

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, it has an officially published BNF grammar, so that is a good reason to try it out.

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The TOML parser is Raku seems to be using NQP. (I.e. is fast.)

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But it is over a small project.

[17:37] <ab5tract> nice! I hope it performs the same for a large one

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> who (except ROckstar) parses that much for it to matter

[17:38] <ab5tract> nijmegenzuigt: theoretically there should be no difference

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is really cool about having an up to date Comma plugin, is that I can use that plugin in CLion and get seamless Raku-and-C work environment for Raku packages that use NativeCall / C-implementations.

[17:40] <lizmat> antononcube maybe you should blog about that  :-)

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nijmegenzuigt Well, "LLM::DWIM" uses TOML, so, I decided to look closer into it.

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> well Nim as ORC! üôÇ

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I tried to come up with a few data structure designs that are "sparse arrays", not "just" sparse matrices. But that is a little too much thinking for a functionality that I have used no more than 3 times in the last 15-20 years.

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I mean using multidimensional sparse arrays with dimensions 3 or (much) more.

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nijmegenzuigt I have heard but forgotten about Nim.

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks for mentioning it! (Not dropping Raku anytime soon for Nim, though.)

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but Nim is in flux so who knows what it is like next year

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Can it use Raku modules?

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> granted as a staunch Wirthian I cant help but love it ofc

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> PASCAL programmers tend to know the value of everything and the Wirth of nothing.

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Or similar...

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> plenty of jokes along those lines üòõ

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is should Nim localizations.

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but eh, 50 years later wheres modules for C++ eh? Pascal can compile its whole IDE, compiler and backend for a dozend architectures before LLVM is done with the first template while still being single-threaded üòé

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mm... right.

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Nim makes me think of Eiffel, though. (Then again, Eiffel is inspired a lot from Ada.)

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> ppl can talk about Raku's sigils,twigils, trigils and all that

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> but the sequence "unit module" is still the weirdest to me

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Can be seen as a shortcut.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> From "tasty_freeze" at Hacker news: Besides his contribution to language design, he authored one of the best puns ever. His last name is properly pronounced something like "Virt" but in the US everyone calls him by "Worth". That led him to quip, "In Europe I'm called by name, but in the US I'm called by value."

[18:09] <lizmat> antononcube yeah, they'd have to be pretty sparse to make it worthwhile to handle them differently from ordinary arrays / matrices

[18:13] <[Coke]> (virt) *groan*

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> maybe some more ...

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I use very sparse matrices often (e.g. with fill-in 0.002%.) I am saying that have not used multidimensional sparse arrays or tensors that often.

[20:54] *** dutchie joined
[20:56] <patrickb> Hey! I need a hint for a problem where I don't know how to do best in Raku. I have an object with some private state. There is a role with some unimplemented methods I need to implement (used by some separate module). The methods will want to modify my private state. But I don't want to expose the roles methods publicly.

[20:56] <patrickb> My first idea was to have an inner class implement the role. But inner classes can't access private attributes of their surrounding class.

[20:57] <timo> can you "trusts" the inner class?

[20:57] <patrickb> Yeah, I can do that. But trusts only allows accessing private methods, not attributes. It get's awkward quickly.

[20:58] <timo> OK. you could have a private accessor method at least :D

[20:58] <patrickb> Passing references to all the state I want to modify into my inner class is another approach, but I have to keep the references up to date. That also turns messy fast.

[20:58] <timo> hmm. what happens if you have a sub inside the outer class that is called by the inner class, passing the instance. does that have access to private attributes?

[20:59] <patrickb> I can pass the instance while constructing the inner object. But that object is still sealed.

[21:00] <timo> right

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb Can you put your state to be a Mao/Hash? Then you can transfer it however you want.

[21:00] <patrickb> Mao?

[21:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, Xi

[21:01] <patrickb> Xi?

[21:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I meant: "Map/Hash" .

[21:01] <patrickb> Ah :-P

[21:02] <patrickb> That's an idea. But it feels really strange that moving over to using a Hash as data structure is the best solution.

[21:02] <patrickb> I could have a State class with only public rw attributes and pass that to the inner class.

[21:03] <patrickb> It's a bit sad that all modifications from then on are method calls, but maybe that's the price to pay...

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can have a special state class to transform into and from a Hash.

[21:04] <timo> time to build Raku::InsideOut

[21:04] <patrickb> Or I go with "**** it!", and just implement the role directly exposing the interface publicly.

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a recent package for object (de-)serialiation to Hash.

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See "Hash2Class" : https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Hash2Class

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> hmm virtualmin is Perl

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> it's for a gateway/managament system for the prox mox ones

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nijmegenzuigt Haven't heard of "virtualmin" before: > The strength of Virtualmin lies in its minimalistic approach, utilizing the OS's provided software to keep your systems lean. Its non-intrusive nature and respect for your server configurations, along with the ease of migration from cPanel/Plesk and straightforward backup solutions, makes it indispensable.

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> Django is waht Allura uses now but Im switching that

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nijmegenzuigt I was joking, BTW, making a semantic inverse of "virtual-min" into "concrete-max."

[23:36] <timo> you might have misunderstood. the nqp command is for compiling nqp code which is still high level compared to just opcodes

[23:38] <Guest7> My bad. How do I run qast nodes from moarvm then?

[23:42] <timo> you use the MASTCompiler for that purpose

[23:43] <timo> we might have tests that exercise this, by which i mean starting with a qast tree and running the code it encodes

[23:43] <timo> may i ask what you want to use this for? RakuAST may be a better fit

[23:44] <timo> or you might desire to go the opposite direction and actually write moar bytecode by hand? or maybe start with MAST actually
