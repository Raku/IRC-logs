[19:48] <toto> hello

[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy Interesting! If you use yamllm in a bash cell in a Jupyter notebook (see "Jupyter::Kernel") you can get the Markdown answers "properly" displayed. (I.e. Markdown rendered.)

[19:50] <toto> can rakudo execute Perl code?

[19:51] *** cm left
[19:52] *** cm joined
[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @toto Yes via "Inline::Perl5". Last time I tried it though it did not work on macOS.

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, it works on Linux.

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See : https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5

[19:53] <toto> who uses raku?

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ Do you want the users listed by name, or by archetype? Or by age buckets?

[19:56] <toto> I would just like to know if a lot of people use raku

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I deployed Raku code at two different companies, though I can‚Äôt vouch for the first still using it because the entire engineering team quit a few years ago.

[20:02] <tbrowder> lizmat: ref Git::Status, i‚Äôm suggesting a PR to either (1) simplify the status to identify the non-clean files but not look into whether it‚Äôs due to the first or second char of the XY pair or (2) completely identify the situation (a complex task with many, confusing combinations). the current status i believe is in between 1 and 2, but closer to 1. looking at the git-status man page i count 19 possibilities for 2. my choice is 

[20:02] <tbrowder> 1 since that tells us when there are no git actions needed and that git directory is clean. note i believe that 1 will also show ‚Äúdirty‚Äù submodules.

[20:06] <tbrowder> also, most of the complex cases take multiple git commands to clean up, which i couldn‚Äôt imagine trying to handle with a script unless it were interactive.

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @toto There are at least 1,000 watchers of the reddit/r/rakulang page.

[20:07] <tbrowder> sounds encouraging

[20:08] <toto> is it much?

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The actual number of users -- who knows. A year and a half ago I was analyzing IRC chat data. Again, there were ‚âà1,000 total unique handles, most of the chtats (‚âà90%) was hapenning between ‚âà200 people.

[20:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @toto No, it is not. üôÇ Neither relatively- nor absolutely speaking.

[20:13] <ingy> antononcube: Glad you tried yamllm out. I'm using it right now to help me write talk proposals for the Clojure Conj conference this Fall :)

[20:14] <ingy> Oh hi vendethiel :)

[20:15] <ingy> Nothing goes into YAMLScript without vendethiel's personal blessing‚Ä¶

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy I did not try yamllm --  I read the article you linked, and browsed the GitHub repository.

[20:15] <ingy> Which is well seasoned by Raku I might add.

[20:17] <ingy> Oh I thought you got properly formatted markdown from it.

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy I know that Raku Jupyter notebooks can render Markdown format properly. üôÇ

[20:20] *** toto left
[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @toto Yes -- see my extensive answer above.

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy Well, it seems "Jupyter::Kernel"  %% bash magic cell cannot redirect output to markdown. (I.e. I lied above.)

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy But, in "Jupyter::Chatbook" one has direct (and indirect) access to LLMs. Here is what I thought I can do with a bash magic cell and yamllm :
