[02:59] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> so the reason i asked if you guys tried other languages is that my friend and i were talking about Raku, i'm currently interviewing and for the time being I'm going to be building a lot of stuff in Raku and posting it to my github page, and my friend basically said if you're gonna be talking about Raku I'd have to have a couple of selling points on Raku @librasteve

[05:44] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'm running into a problem with this code:    use v6.d;  sub MAIN(Int :$port) {     say "Start of LSP";     my $listen = IO::Socket::INET.new( :listen,                                        :localhost<localhost>,                                        :localport($port));      my $fh = "lsp-log.txt".IO.open: :a;     $fh.print: "Start of LSP at port $port\n";      loop {         my $conn = $listen.accept;         try {            

[05:44] <discord-raku-bot> while my $buf = $conn.recv {                 "lsp-log.txt".IO.spurt: $buf;                 # $fh.put: "Request received\n";                 # $fh.put: $buf;             }         }         $conn.close;          CATCH {             default { "lsp-error.txt".IO.spurt: $_.payload }         }      }     $fh.close; } 

[05:46] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> see whenever I run this, the problem is that the "lsp-log.txt".IO.spurt: $buf; works more consistently then the $fn.put commands below. for whatever reason, whether i use netcat to send messages to this server while it's running i'm not able to get $buf or "Request received" to consistently write to the file

[05:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> and i've been wracking my brain trying to solve this

[05:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> if anyone has any ideas as to what might be going on that would be great!

[09:00] <HeikkiL> I am running Rakudo™ v2024.01 and get an error message that I think is an error.

[09:00] <HeikkiL> Define a subroutine: sub htest (Hash %h) {say %h};

[09:01] <HeikkiL> Create a hash: my %first;

[09:01] <HeikkiL> Call: htest %first;

[09:01] <HeikkiL> Error: Type check failed in binding to parameter '%h'; expected Associative[Hash] but got Hash ({})

[09:01] <HeikkiL> How could the subroutine expect 'Associative[Hash]'?

[09:02] *** dakkar joined
[09:16] *** dead1 joined
[09:20] <gfldex> HeikkiL: You are asking for a Hash of Hash. `%h` is a type check of against the role Associative, which a Hash satisfies.

[09:20] <gfldex> A Hash of Hash is to narrow of a type to pass that test.

[09:22] <gfldex> m: sub foo(Hash %h) { dd %h; }; my Hash %h; foo(%h);

[09:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar e93208ce7: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = (my Hash %)␤»

[09:31] <HeikkiL> OK. Thanks everyone. This turned out to be a newby question. Looks like I have to read more about passing arguments to subroutines in raku!

[14:11] <ab5tract> HeikkiL It’s actually less about argument passing specifically than it is about how type declarations intersect with container types

[14:16] <ab5tract> m: my Str %h = %( :x(“y”) ); dd %h

[14:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar e93208ce7: OUTPUT: «Str %h = (my Str % = :x("y"))␤»

[17:52] <tbrowder__> hi, i have a new module in work using multiple sub run calls in a single test file. the test works fine

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <bscan> @aruniecrisps, if you're still dealing with this, I asked ChatGPT. It suggested adding  $fh.flush;  I tested it and that fix worked for me.   https://chat.openai.com/share/1ee4bed7-6d9e-4101-9c2a-0c71845065e5

[17:53] <tbrowder__> pls disredard my issue, running mi6 with the verbose option did the trick
