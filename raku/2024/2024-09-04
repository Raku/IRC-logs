[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Cliff Pickover often posts short puzzles. Many (most?) of them are trivial to solve, but once in a while, he comes up with stuff like this.

[16:42] <tonyo1> .seen rf

[16:42] <tellable6> tonyo1, I saw rf 2023-08-07T20:59:12Z in #raku: <rf> Where does this person get gremlins from? Besides that I think they liked Raku?

[16:42] <tonyo1> woof

[16:44] *** Manifest0 joined
[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo1 Long time, no @rf...

[17:07] <tonyo1> bummer

[17:07] <tonyo1> all this ecosystem stuff is using humming-bird

[17:08] <tonyo1> it's in review now and then i'll write docs & publish.  then it's migration planning for the zef eco

[17:08] <tonyo1> and then, finally, consistent and immediate messaging about dist upload failures

[17:28] <jaguart> In this Cro template, I see the HTML tag in the PAGE macro - but no actual HEAD or BODY tags, where/how are these emitted? https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/views/common.crotmp?ref_type=heads

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jaguart: interesting link into the heart of raku.land Cro app ... I am as mystified as you

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Optional_Tags

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ maybe this?

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> in a nutshell, we are supposed to omit html, head and body (either use them or omit all of them for consistency) --- there are also some very odd guidelines about sometimes dropping end tags which  for one will not be adopting

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (in the browser inspector they are magically added back in)

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so I guess you need to marshall all your links and metas to be together at the top of your .html
