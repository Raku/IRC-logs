[00:05] <Xliff> Neat.

[00:07] <Xliff> timo: So there's no way I can get to that symbol? At all?

[00:13] <timo> there is something

[00:14] <Xliff> ?

[00:15] <timo> looking for it now

[00:15] <Xliff> Thanks.

[00:20] <timo> ok i can't find the code i wrote, but some of the dlopen API lets you find the offset that all the symbols from one shared object are mapped at, and then you can take the address you see in nm or dwarfdump or readelf or something

[00:21] <timo> the problem i needed that for was trying to stringify the function name behind a pointer when there's an MVMCFunction mentioned in the spesh log

[00:21] <timo> and many of the CFunctions that were in there were just LOCAL

[00:22] <timo> so my changes included invoking "nm" on libmoar.so to get all the addresses with the names :D

[00:22] <timo> i'd say that's very obviously not optimal, but it really helped figure some stuff out

[00:36] <timo> in theory, i could just output the pointers raw in the speshlog and look for an offset that makes all pointers line up just so

[00:38] <timo> it's strange, gst_spectrum_get_type is just there in gstspectrum.h why would it be local and not reachable?

[06:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: I did something a bit like that with Dan::Polars - in my case build a new rust SO (from a template) on the fly and then invoke it...

[06:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this all got shelved at some point but you can do some GH archaeology here https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Dan-Polars/blob/3e53045d0e3bc735c731ef2281b5eda2ff54e90f/lib/Dan/Polars/Containers.rakumod#L121, and then L805 is the nativecall and L935 is where I write the rust source to file and call run <cargo build> on it

[06:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if I understand your problem (and I don't) my guess is that the nativecall path can be implemented as a sub like this

[06:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  sub ap_apply_monadic(ExprC) returns ExprC is native(a-path()) { * } 

[06:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: new comment from moznion on HTML::Escape https://github.com/moznion/p6-Backtrace-AsHTML/issues/13#issuecomment-2305776017 hopefully that will appear in zef repo shortly
