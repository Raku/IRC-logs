[00:28] <guifa> librasteve: the goal is to keep the definition of $y inside of the loop

[00:28] <guifa> this is me golfing something I saw in a larger code sample

[00:29] <guifa> basically, the value for $y is lost

[00:37] <wayland76> .tell tbrowder Oh!  That makes sense.  Thanks :) 

[00:37] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to tbrowder

[00:40] <[Coke]> you can define the y as you invoke the loop

[00:42] <[Coke]> m: sub foo ($x) { loop (my $y = $x;;) { $y--; say $y; return 42 if $y < 0 } }; foo 4

[00:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar a469bd8da: OUTPUT: «3␤2␤1␤0␤-1␤»

[00:44] <[Coke]> m: sub foo ($x) { loop (my $y = $x;$y<0;$y--) { say $y;} return 42}; foo 4

[00:48] <[Coke]> and there's the return value

[00:48] <ugexe> that doesn't technically keep it in the loop

[00:48] <ugexe> m: sub foo ($x) { loop (my $y = $x; $y >= 0 ; $y--) { }; say $y; return 42}; foo 4

[00:53] <[Coke]> oops

[00:54] <[Coke]> even says so in the docs. apologies for the mislead

[00:54] <[Coke]> ugexe++

[01:00] <guifa> again, I get that I can define it in other ways. I was trying to golf that the assignment is lost

[01:01] <guifa> m: while True { FIRST my $y = 3; say $y--; last if $y < 0 } 

[01:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar a469bd8da: OUTPUT: «3␤0␤»

[01:03] <guifa> the assignment to 3 should stick around

[01:03] <guifa> and so the output should be 3, 2, 1, 0

[01:05] <wayland76> m:  while True { FIRST { my $y = 3; } say $y--; last if $y < 0 }

[01:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar a469bd8da: ( no output )

[01:07] <guifa> I guess maybe it would need to be state ? 

[01:09] <wayland76> m:  sub foo ($x) { my $y; loop { FIRST $y = $x; $y--; say $y; return 42 if $y < 0 } }; foo 4

[01:09] <wayland76> There we go.  

[01:10] <wayland76> The question then is, should "my" declarations in a FIRST block be magically pushed up to an ancestor scope.  

[01:12] <guifa> The whole point of putting them inside the block is to show they're in that scope

[01:13] <guifa> bisectable: while True { FIRST my $y = 3; say $y--; last if $y < 0 }

[09:46] <lizmat> wayland: in old style tables in pod6, no

[09:46] <lizmat> wayland: in rakudoc procedural tables, yes

[10:10] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/RakuDoc-GAMMA/blob/main/rakudoc_draft_3.rakudoc

[10:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5stract: i have just made a website using htmx (mainly by cloning the htmx.org source) … it feels like the best path for my needs, although I’m still not quite sure where I’ll end up with CSS (bootstrap too old? tailwind too much js / too disruptive of the separation of concerns?)

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i was thinking that something like Elm HTML library in raku that would make Htmx would be perfect … happy to apply some tuits to that if you need

[11:33] <wayland> lizmat: Regarding the RakuDoc thing, should I interpret that as "Not yet, but it's coming"?  

[11:33] <lizmat> well, RakuDoc is very much a thing in RakuAST

[11:34] <lizmat> so with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 it should work

[11:34] <wayland> OK.  So if I submit a PR to the official Raku documentation, will it work?  

[11:35] <wayland> Specifically, my PR at https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4501 has a table -- if I convert to the procedural style, will that be useful or counter-productive?  

[11:35] <lizmat> almost: finanalyst is working on getting the doc site generated using RakuDoc, and *then* it will work  :-)

[11:36] <wayland> Oh, right!  Cool.  Well, I'll leave my PR as is for now then.  

[11:36] <lizmat> it will be useful, but I don't need think it will be merged until finanalyst's work is live

[11:37] <lizmat> which should be soon

[11:37] <lizmat> as possibly before the 2024.07 release

[11:37] <wayland> OK.  I'm not that fussed.  I half wrote it for myself anyway -- "Writing to learn" and all that.  

[11:37] <lizmat> ack  :-)

[11:39] <wayland> Anyway, I'm turning in, but enjoy the failing tests I PR'ed for Hash::Agnostic :p 

[11:39] <lizmat> :-)
