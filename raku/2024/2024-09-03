[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland76: I am not quite up to speed on the TOP ideas yet ... but I have possible related modules (Dan dataframes and Net::Google::Sheets) that may be adjusted to be "TOP drivers" if I understand correctly (and there are others with SQL stuff) ... initiall a quick question would it not be better to use groupby instead of by in the TOP errr top level API?

[10:03] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to wayland

[10:29] <tbrowder>  hi, just pondering. vim has .vimrc, bash has .bashrc, does raku have .rakurc? if not, why not?

[10:35] <lizmat> cause we don't want to go looking for a file / interpreting that at every startup?

[10:36] <lizmat> that's why there are environment variables that you can set, which are checked when needed

[10:42] <El_Che> tbrowder: because vim and bashrc have million configurations and supported features

[10:42] <tellable6> 2024-08-29T18:18:16Z #raku-dev <jdv> El_Che the release is done

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Yes, TOP‚Äôs goals / mission statement are the same as those behind data frames in R.

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> More precisely, actually, those of R‚Äôs ‚Äútidyverse‚Äù.

[10:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> TPO‚Äôs ‚Äúchanging of backends‚Äù property is provided by ‚Äútidyverse‚Äù ‚Äî same pipelines can used for data manipulation or transformation with Apache Spark, SQL engines, or R‚Äôs native data frames.

[11:04] <ab5tract> One place I could see a config file coming in handy could be for running a REPL

[11:05] <ab5tract> but this would make more sense as a configuration for a package that extends the repl, than for the repl itself

[14:38] <[Coke]> aigh, there are several "Linux::<foo>" modules, but one "Linux-<bar>"

[14:50] <timo> do we have any feelings about the classification system python has?

[14:51] <timo> https://pypi.org/classifiers/

[14:58] <timo> isn't a solution to naming inconsistencies of course

[14:58] <timo> just a general thought

[15:09] <jaguart> is this working for anyone else? https://raku-advent.blog/2019/12/02/crud-cro-http-tutorial/

[15:19] <timo> jaguart: what problem are you encountering?

[15:19] <timo> it could be that the tutorial has become outdated by changes to Cro?

[15:20] <jaguart> oh - I meant the website - the tutorial is actually fab

[15:20] <jaguart> and the tutorial works fine with current Cro

[15:20] <timo> oh, yeah i was able to load the page just fine, including the meme in the middle

[15:22] <jaguart> fab thanks - will close my 2M+ tabs... gulp

[15:22] <timo> oh no!

[15:27] <ugexe> [Coke]: maybe this distinction isn't what you're commenting on, but personally I prefer Linux-<foo> for distribution names and Linux::<foo> for module names

[15:27] <[Coke]> "are things in the raku ecosystem modules or distributions?"

[15:28] <ugexe> since the distribution name usually wants to be mapped to the file system directly, i.e. a directory Linux-Foo and not Linux::Foo

[15:28] <ugexe> or Linux-Foo.tar.gz and not Linux::Foo.tar.gz

[15:28] <ugexe> its both. but you cant upload *just* a module to any ecosystem, you upload a distribution that contains 0 or more modules

[15:31] <ugexe> this distinction can sort of be seen in zef, which I don't think ever mentions the word "module" in its output, only distribution

[15:36] <jaguart> I'm looking for projects using Cro::HTTP and Cro::WebApp::Template etc that folks are willing to share - having read the docs I am still frustrated by what should be simple things. I have worked through https://github.com/search?q=%22Cro%3A%3AHTTP%22&type=repositories&ref=advsearch

[15:37] <jaguart> This is fab - https://github.com/Altai-man/sample-cro-crud - any others to share?

[15:43] <timo> you can ask specific questions here if you like

[15:45] <tonyo1> jaguart: i think hummingbird is also based upon cro

[15:59] <patrickb> Humming bird and Cro are completely separate things.

[16:00] <patrickb> https://github.com/raku/RakudoCibot is a middle sized Cro app

[16:02] <jaguart> yeah - I'd spotted that, and Humming-Bird::Core naming pings the Coke/ugexe naming chat :)

[16:04] <jaguart> thanks @patrickb - I will cogitate...

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a "resident" YAML expert -- @ingy

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ingy I wonder / consider is there any utility of converting Markdown files into YAML files.  (1) Is a proper, consistent conversion theoretically and/or practically possible?  (2) Or there are certain limitations?

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke If your "research" and "ww" were / are directed to me, then yes, I researched. (More precisely, "LLMed.")

[17:42] <timo> "ww" means "what i wrote last was put into the wrong window by accident"

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I thought it means "you are welcome" -- "wrong window" seems a better fit (I have to admit.)

[17:45] <[Coke]> timo has it.

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Damn! I could have not researched, then. Just wait for @ingy to respond.

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> It appears that invites to the Discord server are disabled, so I message @roguerakudev for help.

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> *messaged

[18:35] <timo> hm. index and rindex, but split and no rsplit?

[18:37] <lizmat> that would only makes sense with a number of splits, right?

[18:37] <lizmat> otherwise .split.reverse ?

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Is the permanent invite link in #info-and-rules not working? (https://discord.gg/gg2a3T6)

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo Even worse -- there are rand and srand but no rrand.

[18:43] <timo> lizmat: correct. it could even be a way to make negative numbers make sense for the limit argument

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I disabled individuals creating new invite links so we wouldn't have a bunch of different temporary invite codes floating around

[18:44] <timo> i think the question is about the source code of the bridge bot, not how to get into the discord?

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Ah yes, it looks like that is the case for the Mastodon post linked

[18:45] <lizmat> m: dd "foo:bar:baz".split(":", *-2)    # that could work

[18:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar a8111db83: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot resolve caller Real(WhateverCode:D: ); none of these signatures matches:‚ê§    (Mu:U \v:: *%_)‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[18:46] <lizmat> still, rsplit feels more in line with index/rindex

[18:46] <lizmat> problem solving issue?

[22:49] <ugexe> that dist might not have a META6.json, only a META.info

[22:49] <ugexe> yep tahts it

[22:52] <[Coke]> do you have the URL of the repo handy?

[22:52] <[Coke]> just curious what it looks like

[22:54] * [Coke] remembers zef exists and can ask that.

[23:18] <[Coke]> 'zef info Twitter' points at a .targz that's under zoffix's github which itself redirects to what looks like a new version under community modules. 

[23:19] <[Coke]> sorry, zef info Twitter -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raku/REA/main/archive/T/Twitter/Twitter%3Aver%3C1.001001%3E%3Aauth%3Cgithub%3Araku-community-modules%3E.tar.gz -> unzips to Twitter-e30a2715d5a3b5b25ffb98d3b2f07972dbd98868/ which is a snapshot of a zoffixnet version.

[23:33] <ugexe> the version in the tar.gz is 1.001001 which is higher than the one in community modules
