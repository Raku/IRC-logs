[12:12] <greenfork> I have this strange issue when I try to install Pop: https://gitlab.com/jjatria/pop/-/issues/1 . Could it be related to any bugs in Rakudo I should report?

[12:13] <lizmat> yeah, that feels like a Rakudo issue

[12:14] * lizmat tries reproducing

[12:14] <lizmat> % zef install Pop --deps-only already fails for missing deps 

[12:15] <lizmat> so not sure if that's an LTA error message or something else

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Do people here use "Algorithm::Diff" ? https://github.com/Takadonet/Algorithm--Diff

[13:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It seems untouched for 3+ years, but that is likely a testament for stability, utility, etc.

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, it is fairly undocumented, and its outputs do not adhere to those of Perl's "Algorithm::Diff" (but they are supposed to.)

[14:56] <tbrowder> the author hasn't addressed the 2 issues. time to make it a community module?

[15:00] <lizmat> I suggest adding a new issue to it, suggesting a move to raku-community-modules

[15:00] <lizmat> then, if the author doesn't react, or reacts positively to moving, we could do it

[15:01] <lizmat> in 2020 at least a patch was merged, so there's that

[15:01] <tbrowder> looking for opinion on whether to use int or boolean values for user config files. one problem is YAML and JSON handle boolean inputs differently, so allowing both creates some pain points. or just use a simple key:value ascii config file

[15:02] <tbrowder> lizmat: good idea

[15:03] <tbrowder> i like yaml for simple stuff

[15:07] <tbrowder> and yaml bool handling seems almost fool proof

[15:11] <tbrowder> i just filed issue w/ algo diff

[15:11] <lizmat> tbrowder++

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Thanks!

[15:12] <tbrowder> yw

[15:13] <tbrowder> going w/ just yaml for now...

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not sure if its a good idea to name a raku script diff.pl

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah. I experimented with / refactored the original code to be closer to what we would expect from a Raku module. I will submit a PR once it becomes a community module.

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ ++

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: suggest you take a look here ... https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Unit/blob/version2/lib/Physics/Unit/en_SI.rakumod ... this is basically an override to the standard YML Bool treatment

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I wrote this override to solve this need:- please provide a mode to pass unquoted y as 'y' not True,same for n and maybe other tokens per this Closed issue https://github.com/Leont/yamlish/issues/38

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> with this YAML is my fave

[23:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there are "Raku way" to replicate the lynx export of HTML pages into plain text?

[23:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example,  lynx -dump https://some.link > example.txt 

[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course I can just use Proc and slurp...
