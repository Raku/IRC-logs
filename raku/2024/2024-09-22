[15:16] <notable6__> antononcube, Noted! (weekly)

[15:40] <ab5tract> librasteve: thanks again for posting your issue. I have to wonder whether this is entirely related to using the selector menu (I believe this is the same thing I've been calling the "welcome screen"?)

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah it’s the welcome screen

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just tried with File > Open ... no joy I'm afraid

[16:00] <ab5tract> :(

[16:02] <ab5tract> I don't know what could be causing that. did you previously have the Comma plugin installed? I know you upgraded the IntelliJ version, but maybe the rakumod extension is associated with the old `PERL6_*` language classes

[16:02] <ab5tract> at the application level

[16:06] *** summerisle is now known as eof

[16:32] <ab5tract> librasteve: it's probably a long shot, but I did do some fixups on the project model in the newly minted beta 10. let me know how it goes if you get a chance to try it

[16:47] <ab5tract> warning that the same changes might require an open - close - open sequence for some project :(

[16:47] <ab5tract> I <3 my beta testers' patience

[18:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I get an error trying to build with the latest pull for "comma-plugin":

[18:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1287478854944030823/comma-plugin-build-problem.png?ex=66f1b19f&is=66f0601f&hm=e38d17501704cbf9dd60e02ecd4d45b517276d12fb1c48536c313de3dcb886e6&

[18:59] <ab5tract> antontoncube: fixed

[19:02] <ab5tract> btw, if you're ever facing a broken HEAD, you should always be able to checkout the latest tag

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. I just pulled and rebuilt - finished just with warnings. I can see the "comma-2.0.zip" in the distributions directory.

[19:08] *** jjido joined
[19:09] <ab5tract> those warnings aren't coming from comma classes, so I haven't investigated them

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, just an observation...

[19:11] <ab5tract> just an explanation :)

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I am studying this JSON file / content: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin/refs/heads/\ main/src/main/resources/docs/core.json

[19:15] *** Sgeo joined
[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks for pointing it out to me.

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume "CommaIDE" uses it. (Say, when hovering over keywords.)

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5stract: likely my woes are down to something coming over from CommaIDE … I am 100% OK to just open (once) in runIde mode … so delighted you have breathed new life into the Comma plugin (feel free to close the issue … i just felt the workaround should be findable in the unlikely event someone else hits the same tripwire

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> )

[19:22] <ab5tract> librasteve: I really appreciate the issue tickets

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract How about screenshots?

[19:23] <ab5tract> antononcube: I also appreciate all your feedback

[19:23] <ab5tract> librasteve: unfortunately I feel that the `runIde` option is not "good enough" for the final release of 2.0

[19:24] <ab5tract> were you able to try the latest version with a problematic project?

[19:25] <ab5tract> as my chief beta testers, you have both been invaluable antononcube++ and librasteve++ 

[19:26] *** sena_kun joined
[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I plan to try comma-2.0 later today over a large, stale project.

[19:33] <ab5tract> nice! looking forward to hearing what happens

[19:34] <ab5tract> technically the size of th project shouldn't matter.. but I'm glad to have you testing this theory

[20:40] *** sena_kun left
[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5tract: i just rebuilt latest HEAD (15 mins ago) ... did not solve the issue

[20:46] <ab5tract> Boo

[20:46] <ab5tract> :(

[20:48] <ab5tract> I wonder how we can approach fixing this… would you be able to provide me an archive of a problematic project?

[20:49] <ab5tract> I’m on discord with the same user name if that helps in transmitting

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hang on

[20:54] * ab5tract be hanging

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> update on Issue

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry for slow response, but this is quite thorny and I want to be deliberate & thorough so as not to mislead

[21:24] <ab5tract> Thanks! I will check this out tomorrow and see what I can do

[21:29] <ab5tract> I think in general it’s probably good practice to exclude .idea files from git repos, but I don’t know for certain

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - i agree

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> they're in my .gitignore these days

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> must sleep

[21:33] *** jjido left
[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I made major refactoring of method names using comma-2.0. (Renaming from camelCase to kebab-case.)

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ≈ 50% of the time I had to quit IntelliJ because the global-replacement window was hanging.

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I cannot tell is this a comma-2.0 problem or an IntelliJ problem. I assume, the parsing or highlighting of Raku code is too slow.

[21:49] <ab5tract> Were you doing this via the refactoring menu? Or search / replace?

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Global search / replace (Cmd-Shift-R).

[22:16] *** sdfgsdfg left
[22:20] <ab5tract> That should not have been slow :(

[22:21] <ab5tract> I don’t see why the parser would be involved. That should only be relevant to your active editor tab(s)

[22:22] <timo> without taking a profile, all you can do is guess. try installing VirtualVM that has some profiling tools available for you to attach to any jvm program

[22:24] *** sdfgsdfg joined
[22:24] <ab5tract> I’ll give that a shot.

[22:24] <timo> there should also be something in intellij idea, but not sure how much you get in the community edition of same

[22:24] <timo> actually, can you get an intellij idea ultimate for working on comma-2.0 now that it's no longer commercial

[22:25] <ab5tract> It’s easy to run it in sandbox

[22:25] <timo> the what in what now?

[22:26] <ab5tract> Do you mean they give out ultimate licenses to non commercial plugin development?

[22:26] <timo> not plugin development, any development, if i'm not mistaken?

[22:26] <timo> Students, teachers, academic institutions and non-commercial open source software projects qualify for the 1-year complimentary subscriptions allowing them to use the fully-functional versions of software for non-commercial purposes. For the complimentary subscription terms, check the subscription comparison matrix.

[22:26] <timo> https://www.jetbrains.com/store/comparison.html

[22:27] <ab5tract> Nice

[22:27] <timo> i guess that's a "first year's free, then you're hooked" kind of deal

[22:27] <timo> oh, annual renewals, and the open source project "owns" it

[22:28] <ab5tract> Sandbox = intellij spawns a sandboxed ide instance with the plugin installed

[22:29] <ab5tract> Breakpoint debugging is all I’ve used it for so far but I’m sure there is profiling available as well

[22:31] <ab5tract> (Sandbox obviously means many other things, I am just clarifying what I was referring to)

[22:31] <timo> https://www.jetbrains.com/pages/intellij-idea-profiler/

[22:33] <timo> ah it's only in Ultimate, ok

[22:34] <ab5tract> I’ve got a week or so left on my license

[22:35] <ab5tract> Anyway, it will have to wait for tomorrow
