[18:23] <sour> hey, is it generally a known thing that running rakudo on windows has some hiccups?

[18:24] <[Coke]> I am aware of issues with long paths, but that's it

[18:25] <sour> this one liner of "shell 'dir';" causes some errors and doesn't print the result of the command (run 'dir' works ok)

[18:26] <sour> i'll fiddle a bit more with it

[18:31] <[Coke]> you need to run that as 'cmd dir' or somesuch.

[18:33] <[Coke]> I don't have a windows box in front of me at the moment, apologies.

[18:33] <sour> no worries, you mean something like: shell "cmd dir"; ? I'm following the samples at raku.guide

[19:28] <[Coke]> I was wrong, this works:

[19:28] <[Coke]> raku -e "say shell('dir')"

[19:29] <[Coke]> so: what version of windows, raku, which shell are you using, what's your script, etc.

[19:29] <[Coke]> what errors are you seeing...

[19:32] <[Coke]> raku -e "shell 'dir'" # even better

[19:35] <sour> it's a longer error trace i assume, the first thing being 'Use of uninitialized value @!args of type Any in string context.

[19:35] <sour> Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.

[19:35] <sour> Â  in sub warn at 'SETTING::'src/core.c/control.rakumod line 267'

[19:35] <[Coke]> what code are you running?

[19:35] <sour> my $*DISTRO is mswin32 (10.0.17763.529), windows 10

[19:36] <[Coke]> does the one liner I showed work from the command/powershell prompt?

[19:36] <sour> your one liner

[19:36] <sour> no, same thing there

[19:36] <[Coke]> what does raku --version say?

[19:36] <sour> v2024.04

[19:37] <[Coke]> OOC, what dir are you in?

[19:38] <sour> some subdir on my users' desktop, I got it opened in VSCode

[19:38] <sour> hmmm, lemme check 1 thing

[19:38] <[Coke]> maybe try a different dir, just in case?

[19:39] <sour> yeah, just tried, same error seems like

[19:40] <[Coke]> what shell are you using?

[19:40] <[Coke]> 'command prompt', 'powershell', are you already in raku's REPL?

[19:40] <sour> same error happens with echo

[19:40] <sour> this is from git bash

[19:40] <sour> I tried it with command prompt, that seems to not yield an error..

[19:40] <[Coke]> does 'dir' work in git bash?

[19:41] <[Coke]> without raku in the mix?

[19:41] <sour> yeah it does

[19:41] <[Coke]> ok. it might be going out of it's way to make that work.

[19:41] <sour> yeah it has to be tied somehow with me running the one liner from git bash

[19:41] <[Coke]> er, its

[19:42] <[Coke]> does ls instead of dir work with git bash and raku?

[19:43] <sour> no, same error. echo also errors out

[19:43] <[Coke]> echo ight have been a shell builtin but ls should work. weird. pretty sure that works on my work laptop. will check when I can.

[19:44] <sour> thx for the help. the full trace i put here: https://pastebin.com/9zvnB3xk

[19:46] <[Coke]> the key error there is line 8

[19:46] <[Coke]> it failed, there was no outut, and then shell tried to print that nothing.

[21:30] <ugexe> that output doesnt make sense

[21:30] <ugexe> the command shown is raku -e "shell 'echo'"

[21:30] <ugexe> why is there output mentioning dir?

[21:31] <ugexe> line 2 shows one of the @!args is Any despite that we see it is passed 'echo'

[21:34] <ugexe> what does `raku -e 'say %*ENV<ComSpec>'` show?
