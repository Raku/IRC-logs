[16:56] <xinming> In this case, How do we get the array of the whole arg?

[16:57] <xinming> IIRC, there is a syntax in function declaration, which is something like  sub t (@x = ($a, $b)) { ... };

[16:57] <xinming> But not sure

[17:12] <ab5tract> m: sub foo { dd @_ }; foo ‘Perl’, 5, ‘style’

[17:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar abc1a5f51: OUTPUT: «["Perl", 5, "style"]␤»

[17:13] <ab5tract> m: sub foo(*@a) { dd @a }; foo ‘slurpy’, ‘style’

[17:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar abc1a5f51: OUTPUT: «["slurpy", "style"]␤»

[17:19] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/04/22/2024-17-abaacab-xabddcabaacab/

[17:23] <xinming> ab5tract: Nope, What I mean is, IIRC, there is something like   sub t (|c = ($p1, $p2)) { ... }   kind of syntax.

[17:23] <xinming> Or maybe I remember wrong

[17:38] <xinming> I've read raku docs several times, I do remember there is such kind of syntax for this. :-)

[17:42] <ab5tract> I had forgotten about it :)

[17:56] <[Coke]> ugexe: in one of my zef-deps tests I am now getting https://gist.github.com/coke/3058d45c5bb61d76ddd010c6ea56a64a "use of Nil" errors from Zef::Repository

[17:57] <[Coke]> trying to golf this

[18:00] *** reportable6 left
[18:02] *** reportable6 joined
[18:06] <[Coke]> think it's here: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/lib/Zef/Repository/LocalCache.rakumod#L145

[18:07] <[Coke]> er, https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/main/lib/Zef/Repository.rakumod#L145

[18:07] <[Coke]> (having the backtrace show the precompiled hash IDs makes it slightly more challenging, apologies)

[20:08] <ugexe> [Coke]: maybe try `zef nuke StoreDir`

[20:08] <ugexe> or maybe `zef update`

[20:08] <ugexe> the key i think being to recreate the index for the repos

[20:17] <[Coke]> no change - tried update first, then nuke, same error each time

[20:17] <ugexe> what are the steps to reproduce

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is this funky "array destructuring" in the docs by any chance?

[20:18] *** jpn joined
[20:19] <ugexe> https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Destructuring_arguments

[20:19] <ugexe> i think those are the same

[20:23] <[Coke]> ugexe: let me try with a fresh clone of my repo, but: git clone git@github.com:coke/raku-zef-deps.git; cd raku-zef-deps; zef test . (it's t/dot.t that gets noisy)

[20:24] <[Coke]> er, zef install --deps-only . probably also

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah yes, I could have searched for "destructuring" - thanks for googling that for me https://letmegooglethat.com

[20:24] <[Coke]> yup, Welcome to Rakudo™ v2024.03.

[20:28] <[Coke]> git clone git@github.com:coke/raku-zef-deps.git; cd raku-zef-deps; zef install --deps-only .; raku -I. t/dot.t # minimal

[20:29] <[Coke]> I tried to golf it but I think it might need to be using the module and not just a script.

[20:31] *** chloekek left
[20:38] <ugexe> i think App::Zef-Deps is broken

[20:38] <ugexe> it is passing values like "name	Zef" to my $candidates = try $zef.find-candidates($module).head;

[20:39] <ugexe> oh maybe that is just the result of gist and not what it is actually passing

[20:44] <[Coke]> I'll double check that as well

[20:47] <ugexe> at a minimum i think App::Zef-Deps needs `my @queue = map { Zef::Identity.new(|$_) }, @module;`

[20:51] <ugexe> maybe not...

[20:51] <[Coke]> must have accidentally passed before

[20:53] <ugexe> my @queue = map { Zef::Identity.new(|$_).identity }, @module; rather, although this doesn't entirely fix it

[20:55] <ugexe> probably need to use Zef::IDentity.new(|$_).identity in some other spots as well

[20:55] <ugexe> which turns stuff like "{ "name": "wahtever", "ver": 42 }" into wahtever:ver<42>

[20:56] <[Coke]> oh - wonder if I screwed up dec7c763fc1a092eb7ec40d47694eb096904d208 last year and din't notice

[20:56] <linkable6> (2023-10-31) https://github.com/coke/raku-zef-deps/commit/dec7c763fc Prefer hash format for META6.json deps

[20:57] <ugexe> @module = map { Zef::Identity.new(|$_).identity }, @module;

[20:57] <ugexe> that is the one line you need to add

[20:57] <[Coke]> oops, relevant comment, not relevant commit

[20:57] *** linkable6_ left
[20:57] <ugexe> in MAIN-handler

[20:58] <[Coke]> ah - no, it is relevant - i happen to work if you have ":ver" in the meta6.json - this will fail for any modules using the hash vwersion of meta6

[20:58] <[Coke]> ugexe++

[21:00] *** linkable6_ joined
[21:03] <ugexe> use Zef::Distribution::Local; given Zef::Distribution::Local.new($*CWD) { say $_.depends-specs.map(*.identity); say $_.build-depends-specs.map(*.identity); say $_.test-depends-specs.map(*.identity) }

[21:03] <ugexe> slightly more abstracted

[21:04] <ugexe> i guess that isn't useful though since it requires the distribution to actually be downloaded already

[21:08] <[Coke]> META7.json ?

[21:09] <[Coke]> (just saw that in a backtrace)

[21:10] *** jpn left
[21:10] <ugexe> ?

[21:17] <[Coke]> afk. I'll try to fix this and cut a release shortly
