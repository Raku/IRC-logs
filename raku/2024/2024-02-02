[00:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I might make a blog post about making calendars with LLMs -- it is seems to be a fairly good didactic topic.

[13:24] *** festerdam joined
[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hmmmm - that's a blow

[13:28] <lizmat> yeah  :-(

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> fwiw I think that the raku community should support the transfer of the commaide IP to the community to ensure that the open source offer is accepted and that there is a place for the code. I have noticed that the latest comma plugin requires a downgrade from the lasest intellij release (so is behind) and I would be happy to join a handoff training session to try and learn the plugin release skills (technically the

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> plugin would be a better choice for most coders than a separate stand alone IDE if it was up to date)

[13:32] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure jnthn would be up for that

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I think that is good idea. I know/knew about the IntelliJ downgrade for the plugin, but I thought that was a feature.

[14:32] <El_Che> librasteve: intellij releases often broke comma. In practice was the comma plugin not an option for paying intellij customers that want to stay up to date with the updates. I ended with a licensed intellij for *all* languages, and a separate comma community installation for raku. Not complaining here, I appreciate the work (it was the best raku ide for me after all), just stating what I experienced

[14:35] *** epony left
[14:35] <El_Che> so, thank you, Comma team!

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Some of the explanations given here https://commaide.com/discontinued , describe pretty well my experience with Commaide: 1) New release crashing on my macs, 2) After subscribing for a few years, I decided the last working for me version is "good enough."

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder "wanna copy of a page of my current dev version in Dutch?" -- I think I have something else in mind... Also, if I use LLMs the language localization is easy. (Or expected to be.)
