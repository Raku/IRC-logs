[23:19] <ingy> does rakudo+moar not yet have linux aarch64 binaries?

[23:22] <lizmat> https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/ is where I'd check

[23:24] <ingy> thanks lizmat

[23:24] <ingy> fyi, that page looks really weird with a darkmode browser mode on it :)

[23:27] <ingy> https://rakudo.org/downloads is where I was first looking. that page looks up to date as of dec 2023, but only shows x86 binaries for linux
