[01:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 🙂 thanks for pointing it out!

[01:09] <guifa> I kinda wish there were an equivalent for <!> that failed the outer regex instead of just the current alternation

[01:09] <guifa> maybe <!!> ? 

[01:10] <guifa> sort of like a "I'm intentionally taking you down a bad path so die plz"

[01:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Shouldn't this happen with fail and || ?

[01:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I.e. emulated...

[01:13] <guifa> actually maybe it doesn't and I'm forgetting about backtracking

[10:05] <xinming> I used    sub array-eq (@a, @b) {  for @a Z @b -> ($a, $b) { $a == $b }; True }

[10:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> that always returns True

[10:11] <SmokeMachine> Why not using eqv?

[10:13] <SmokeMachine> m: sub array-eq(@a, @b) { [&&] @a Z[==] @b }; say array-eq [1,2,3], [1,2,3]; say array-eq [1,2,2], [1,4,3]

[14:40] <[Coke]> Todd2: I was the one responding via email; all the ANSI codes just work for me on the same version of raku - tried to sync up the module version and then went into a rabbit hole of not being able to compile on windows 11.

[14:41] <[Coke]> If you're having trouble with just emitting the direct codes, then it's not an issue with the module; guessing you have some OS issue that is not setup to enable the ANSI codes.

[16:23] <lizmat> I guess that made 2 of us  :-)

[16:24] <Xliff> Buried in nqp of all things. Is this available in the docs? All of the $!flags should be documented there.

[16:26] <lizmat> not sure

[16:26] <lizmat> whether documented I mean

[16:26] <lizmat> the reason it's buried in nqp, is because it's needed to build the proper QAST I guess

[16:27] <Xliff> I would look myself, but I'm on the clock and have a meeting in 2 hours. 

[16:27] <lizmat> there's no hurry  :-)

[16:27] <lizmat> for looking that up, I mean  :-)
