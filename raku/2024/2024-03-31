[11:04] <tbrowder> ref us a/c boeing used to be backbone of usaf transport a/c, present situation is sad

[11:10] <tbrowder> librasteve: thnx for note on windows. the final straw was when my computer (dual boot) couldn't upgrade windows because the chipset was too old, and windows wouldn't stop complaining about it

[11:11] <tbrowder> someday i'll wipe it and put only fresh debian on it

[11:12] <tbrowder> right now it is just taking up space in my closet

[11:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I put ubuntu 22.04 LTS on an old mac mini - now doing a great job

[12:31] <tbrowder> hi, just released update to Text::Utils. cool new sub "sort-list" (from Abbreviations) for those of us who cannot remember all the nuances of sorting lists of different types

[13:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I found and used  ‚ÄúText::Utils‚Äù  because of wrap-text. But at some point I figured out certain settings in VS Code, so now I use ‚ÄúText::Utils‚Äù much less often.

[15:28] <tbrowder> so i'm having trouble with my module's README on github. the linux and macos badges work but not the windows one. all the actual test runners pass, but only the windows badge shows failure. any suggestions are appreciated.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Stick to macOS.

[15:37] <tbrowder> well i try to be an equal opportunity author, and to gain lots of raku folks we better support windoze as much as we can

[15:38] <tbrowder> (sorry for the slur)

[15:38] <Voldenet> took me a while to notice that slur

[15:38] <Voldenet> it fits so casually

[15:39] <tbrowder> yes, a dictionary-worthy pronunciation aid

[15:40] <tbrowder> i learned that years ago on some news group i think

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes -- last year during a payed gig with Raku, we could not go further with a certain part of the project because Raku is hard to install and run on Windows.

[15:42] <tbrowder> kinda like going to a local hangout that only allows ny yankees fans

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> > Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.

[15:50] <Voldenet> windows is hard to install, so everything using it is hard to install by default

[19:25] <patrickb> If I have a file descriptor, which I've received from `posix_openpt()`, can I somehow turn it into an IO::Handle or do something else so I can work with it in Raku land?

[20:09] <Xliff> How can I get the results of the previous expression in the REPL

[20:15] <patrickb> Xliff: I think lizmat implemented or at least designed something like that. Not sure how it works anymore though.

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff If you know the evaluation entry index, say 12, you can use *12.

[20:21] <patrickb> I see this `nqp::p6bindattrinvres(HANDLE,IO::Handle,'$!PIO',PIO)` in rakudo/src/core.c/io_operators.rakumod. But that's not exactly clean.

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Alternatively, you can use the REPL provided by "Jupyter::Kernel" and "Jupyter::Chatbook" -- then you can use _ .

[20:22] <patrickb> Is there a reason there is no API for this? Am I missing a reason why this is a bad idea?

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a demo with the "Jupyter::Chatbook":

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff See the first section in this advent post by lizmat: https://raku-advent.blog/2022/12/25/day-25-rakudo-2022-review/

[20:31] <coleman> patrickb: I don't know the details but an FD is a platform-specific concept iiuc. Still, it would be very useful for scripts because a raku script could be used for systemd socket-activated services (for example); or newer linux APIs.

[20:32] <coleman> This is something we'd presumably lean on libuv for handling at a low level, I would assume.
