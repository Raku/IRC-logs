[00:28] <Voldenet> probably wasn't deliberate breaking change

[01:09] <Xliff_> Yeah, I'll notify lizmat tomorrow, if she doesn't read the scrollback.

[01:10] <Xliff_> Thanks for the bisect. One of these days, I'll figure out how to work it...

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I also have problems installing "Net::ZMQ" -- do think this might be brew related?

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For reference: https://github.com/arnsholt/Net-ZMQ/issues/23a

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lemme check

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okay, my issue of 08-Apr has gone uncommented - so this module is effectively unsupported and we will have to fork and fix outselves

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the error states

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  /System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OSlibzmq.5.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/xxx/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.04/lib/libzmq.5.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/xxx/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2024.04/lib/libzmq.5.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libzmq.5.dy

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> BUT, as you surmise, on Mac, brew install zmq put the dylib here: opt/homebrew/Cellar/zeromq/4.3.5_1/libzmq.5.dy

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and the nativecode bits of the Net::ZMQ4 module say this sub zmq_strerror(int32 --> Str) is native('zmq',v5) { * }

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, we just have to copy or link opt/homebrew/Cellar/zeromq/4.3.5_1/libzmq.5.dylib to usr/lib/libzmq.5.dylib.

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think I had to do that recently on my mac... I got to look into this problem because of my GitHub actions failing. (For "Jupyter::Chatbook".)

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I'm not knowledgeable enough to say that ... I have tried a few things like that but have not cracked the code yet

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I read that brew install writes to /usr/local/lib ... which would make sense since all the code calling the dylib cannot know to look in a particular Cellar dir (or there must be another place / mechanism) where brew puts dynlibs - for the record there is certainly no /usr/lib/libzmq.5.dy or /usr/local/lib/libzmq.5.dy file or symlink on my machine after successful brew install zeromq

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I think that Apple locks down /usr/lib btw

[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok.This is something Brian Duggan should be interested in too.

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> You did it for libUUID

[15:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo üôÇ Yeah, sure!

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please share back if you find a fix

[15:59] *** jpn left
[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My goal is to make a fix for the GitHub actions for building /testing "Jupyter::Chatbook". (Right now, only the Linux one passes.)

[16:15] <tbrowder> ref libUUID, it's a little awkward to use, but raku module UUID::V4 works great

[16:17] <tbrowder> ugexe: i'm looking at extending and renaming my HowToUseModuleResources to some las

[16:19] <tbrowder> *less eye-hurting. do you (1) have any objections and (2) do you have a suggestion for a good name?

[16:21] <tbrowder> i see a real need for it. some of the old modules make it a pain to download their payloads.

[16:28] *** thaewrapt joined
[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Check the actions I set up on Marrow. It works for Linux and Mac, and I think I was close to having a windows build workiing too.

[18:27] <ugexe> Tutorial::DistributionResources or some such?

[18:27] <ugexe> https://github.com/tbrowder/HowToUseModuleResources/blob/ae693d235e2934e6a744925ab6b1911bce8828fa/META6.json#L21 - using a relative path like that isn't going to work the way you think btw

[18:29] <ugexe> i don't think that'll work for installed distributions for example

[18:37] <SmokeMachine> m: multi circumfix:<[ ]>(*@a,*%type where {.elems == 1}){ my $of = %type.keys.head; my ::($of) @ = @a}; dd [1,2,3]:Int; dd [<a e i o u>]:Str;

[19:42] <tbrowder> ugexe: it does work for me with zef-installed modules. rather than a tutorial module, i see a utility distro module to "use" without change in other modules to provide easy access to installled module payloads.

[19:44] <tbrowder> something like Module::Utils

[19:51] *** jpn joined
[19:55] *** jpn left
[20:23] <ugexe> if it works it is only coincidentally, but i'm still skeptical that it does work 

[20:25] <ugexe> you'd have to reference it as e.g. $?DISTRIBUTION.content("../lib/Whatever.rakumod") instead of $?DISTRIBUTION.content("lib/Whatever.rakumod") which doesn't really make sense

[20:28] <ugexe> although i'm speaking strictly from Rakudo core. now that i think about it zef probably cleans that path up and turns it into lib/Whatever.rakumod

[20:28] <ugexe> I'm still not sure if it'd work correctly though

[21:01] <tbrowder> well, I've forked it and renamed it as Module::Utils. I'm adding some more routines and I hope to release it later today. i test it by installing it with zef locally and test it in a separate directory. from the source repo

[21:04] <tbrowder> although i agree it may not work when decoupled as a separate module

[21:05] <ugexe> Module::Utils seems like a bit of an odd name to me. The distribution seems fine for acting as an example or tutorial, but it doesn't provide any utilities

[21:06] <tbrowder> i have another in-work module using it to see about that

[21:06] <ugexe> what utility could it possibly provide?

[21:06] <ugexe> all it can do is show the resources of Module::Utils

[21:06] <ugexe> that isn't going to be useful to anything outside of Module::Utils itself

[21:08] <ugexe> for the code in Module::Utils to be useful to another distribution, you'd have to cut and paste the code from Module::Utils itself into the other distribution and not e.g. `use Module::Utils`

[21:08] <tbrowder> that's what i will be testing. i'm old and stubborn ;-D

[21:09] <tbrowder> and  i did say above that you're probably right

[21:12] <tbrowder> in that case i will stiil add some more subs and rename it to something appropriate for copy/paste

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo It looks like the last time you run / triggred the "Marrow" actions on GitHub was two months ago -- two months ago I was also running the macOS actions with (constent) success.

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo Can you trigger those actions today?

[21:25] <ugexe> github actions macos-latest upgraded macos to 14 as well as switched to arm64

[21:25] <ugexe> in the last month

[21:26] <ugexe> brew installs arm stuff in a different directory

[21:29] <ugexe> https://gist.github.maxmind.com/nlogan/3e4bb49a50721cc5501d0804ab62dc1e

[21:29] <ugexe> something like that can work around the github macos on arm using homebrew issue

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üò¶ sorry.

[21:46] <tbrowder> ugexe: of course you were right. back to the drawing board on a rename. 

[21:49] <tbrowder> the distro name should indicate the lib/X.module is suitable for copy/past into one's own module distro
