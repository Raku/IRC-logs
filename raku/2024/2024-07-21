[05:13] <wayland76> I've just had a look at htmx (ie. read the web pages).  My main experience in frontend dev is that I tried using Vue a few years ago.  I think htmx looks like a move in the right direction, but if I were working towards an ideal web frontend experience, I'd rewrite libxml/libxslt in Rust (someone's already doing that), and support more recent versions of XSLT/XPath.  Then I'd build something like htmx around xslt.  That'd give a lot more freedom around tag/

[05:13] <wayland76> attribute naming and the like.

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5stract: I have made a GH repo for us to hack away on raku HTMX and share design ideas - its in my personal raku GH org for now - happy to keep it there (ie I am on the hook for maintenance) or to move where folks think best .... just wanted a place to start without hogging irc

[14:29] <lizmat> url?   maybe something to mention in the weekly?
