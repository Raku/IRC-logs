[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Thanks for mentioning "Markdown::Grammar"!

[14:29] *** notna joined
[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I suggested it before to @librasteve , but quickly and immediately dismissed it !!

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, I do use Pod6 translations in "Markdown::Grammar" in order to verify / debug the parser. (I have mentioned that before.)

[15:32] <tbrowder> .tell ugexe: iâ€™m getting an error installing latest Git::Status, but i donâ€™t see the error when i test locally. i did get the same error while i was testing the PR but i fixed it with help from git experts on IRC #git. i will submit a gist here soon.

[15:32] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[15:59] <tbrowder> line 20 shows the unexpected error

[16:01] <tbrowder> maye error in Zef::Service::TAP

[16:01] <tbrowder> *maybe

[16:02] <ugexe> i dont think that has anything to do with zef

[16:02] <tellable6> hey ugexe, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/31d94fc182dd27bd4066378058adce43

[16:03] <ugexe> the error says its looking for a .git directory, but the distribution .tar.gz almost certainly doesn't contain such a folder

[16:03] <ugexe> so my guess is the test is written with bad assumptions

[16:04] <ugexe> you could download the .tar.gz and manually run the tests and i assume it would fail similarly

[16:04] <ugexe> if you clone the repo and test it would work, because cloning a repo is going to create the .git directory

[16:05] <ugexe> the test should arguably be rewritten so it fails in this scenario as well

[16:05] *** jpn joined
[16:11] *** soverysour joined
[16:11] <tbrowder> hm, the xt test does that. i thought the xt test is only used on the local side

[16:12] <tbrowder> not with zef install

[16:12] <ugexe> it is not an xt test you showed

[16:13] <ugexe> t/01-basic.rakutest

[16:13] <tbrowder> hm...that helps, thanks

[16:23] <tbrowder> ok, i see that error was there on version 0.0.1. the is-deeply test seems to be the culprit. thanks for the info

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> according to the docs Markdown parser suitable for making converters of Markdown files into files of different kind of formats

[17:49] *** wlhn left
[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> since I would like to keep everything in MD, superficially, I have no interest for something that converts MD to POD6

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [sorry for the dismissal of the idea ... I do agree that Grammar::Markdown is a vital piece for selling raku

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ]

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and now I realise that (in theory), it would be possible to add =head md to POD6 and then have that call Grammar::Markdown to render it

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve First of all, I do not mind the dismissal. Second, I suggested it because much of my work is Markdown-centric. I do use both Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks, but if I want to publish any of them I have to convert to Markdown 70% of the time.

[18:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But since after publication I edit the corresponding Markdown files a lot, I wanted to have "Markdown::Grammar" in order to "recover" the computational notebook representation.

[18:01] *** Sgeo joined
[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, "Markdown::Grammar" conversion to Mathematica was a primary goal. Conversion to Pod6, Org-mode, and HTML were secondary.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There are at least two popular programs for converting Markdown files to Jupyter notebooks.

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, conversion to Jupyter notebooks is in the TODO list of "Markdown::Grammar", but low in priority.

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cool

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I suppose that I would like to be able to combine putting MD in my rakumod files (via =head md) and then having Mi6 render that to README

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do see those kind of converters as a "calling card" for Raku -- it definitely and decisively demonstrates one of Raku's most unique and powerful features. So, in some sense, those kind of converters should be made "regardless."

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I get that this is not generalizable - so we would need =head md in general to invoke Grammar::Markdown, and then to have a "pass thru" mode if you want to output MD in the first place

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ++ on the calling card!

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The =head md  inclusion should not be that hard to do with "Markdown::Grammar" -- it is simple text splicing.

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve BTW, the package name I refere to is "Markdown::Grammar", not "Grammar::Markdown". I do not think the later exists in the "official" ecosystem.

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is "Text::Markdown", though.

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Text::Markdown" has similar -- but much narrower -- mission as "Markdown::Grammar". (I could not use "Text::Markdown" in any way in my workflows.)

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh, yes Markdown::Grammar, soz

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> &afk

[20:18] <tbrowder> i need some advice. i need some generated code to create a module during the zef install/build process. question: does the script have to be completely independent or can it "use" code in an existing module in the repo to be installed?

[21:26] <tbrowder> never mind, the answer per @ugexe in the Build.rakumod exaample it makes provision for adding all repo paths so they CAN be used by the build script

[21:33] <tbrowder> but here is another question: is there a way to run multiple scripts from Build.rakumod?

[21:53] <[Coke]> it's raku code, so sure.
