[01:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs I am sure some people from the field of "digital humanities" have considered making corresponding classifiers.

[01:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder No, I appreciate efforts of amateur comedian-wannabes. (And grade them.)

[02:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ðŸ’¯

[02:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I want to factor out from "Data::Generators" the probability distributions and related random variates generation. What is a good name for the factored out module?

[02:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 1) Math::Distributions 2) Statistics::Distributions

[02:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 3) Math::Random::Distribution (my least favorite)

[03:15] <Xliff_> 2

[03:15] <Xliff_> Stats::Distributions

[03:17] *** skyesoss left
[03:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Ok -- that is my favorite too.

[03:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, no, I prefer "Statistics::Distributions"

[03:42] <Xliff_> antoncube: Then Statistics::Distributions it is!

[03:42] <Xliff_> If that is your choice.

[03:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think I have other packages with the "Statistics::" prefix.

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a "precendent" in Perl's ecosystem for "Statistics::Distributions" : https://metacpan.org/pod/Statistics::Distributions

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (And, no -- I do not plan to use that Perl code in any way.)

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <ivarec> Newbie here. Are there official plugins/extensions for VSCode and Jetbrains? I found CommaIDE, which seems dead on a quick glance (not sure), and a VSCode extension that doesn't seem officially endorsed by Raku (although it looks cool).  My Emacs time is long over after a nasty pinky inflammation that took a long time to fix ðŸ˜„

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ivarec  Same here -- unfortunately my Emacs days are over.

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> CommaIDE has also a plugin version for IntelliJ -- at first I was using that.

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Commaide is very good / useful if you want to write packages. Some vi-cult members here might tell you about alternatives. (Which are not Emacs- based.)

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Visual Studio Code has a Raku plugin which is good. You might to fiddle with settings in order to get smoother experience. For example, hooking-up with a code running plugin.

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I use VSCode via Jupyter notebooks to do reseach with Raku. (Not package development.)

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bscan.raku-navigator

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <ivarec> Is the CommaIDE plugin version actively maintained? Or is VSCode the safer bet?

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ivarec Yes and no. So, Commaide was commercial product with both free, communuty version and payed, with more features version. The makers of Commaide decided at some point that it is too expensive for them (in terms of  time, efforts, or money) to continue developing it, so they released the whole thing as an open source project.

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That project is looking for and gathering for volunteers. Feel free to become one. Of course, for that you should first familiarize yourselv with Commaide's most recent version.

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> IMO, it really depends what you want to do with Raku.

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <ivarec> Yeah, I was wondering about that. I might help if Raku fits my needs. The grammar features are really unique, from what I can tell

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This why I started using Raku -- grammars are first class citizens and Raku has OOP for grammar "management" built in.

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For at least a year or two I did not use or learned anything else of Raku except grammar related functionalities.

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a post about CommaIDE being relased: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/02/19/2024-08-comma-completed/

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> itâ€™s worth trying the commaide - the intellij plugin needs an older version of intellij these days â€¦ and then wonâ€™t play nice with other plugins that need the intellij latest :cameliathink:
