[01:48] <tellable6> antononcube, I saw tbrowder 2024-02-03T16:12:13Z in #raku: <tbrowder__> m: class F { has $.a =1}; class B is F { has $.a = 2}; my $a = F.new; my $b = B.new; say $a.a; say $b.a;

[02:01] <tbrowder__> hi

[02:01] <tbrowder__> i be here

[02:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder So I finally understood what do you mean by saying "calendar in/with Raku."

[02:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowser You mean a printable calendar with different events marked in it, etc.

[02:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> When I was talking about calendars, I had in mind those produced by Emacs or the UNIX function cal.

[02:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Since, I was trying to convince certain LLMs to produces those kind of calendars, I finally decided to make a package for them. ("Text::Calendar".)

[02:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> At some point the calendar functions of "Text::Calendar" would use the localizations in "Date::Names".

[11:58] <tbrowder__> antononcube: gotcha. my current calendar does the emacs or cal thing to stdout and uses Date::Names to get output in 13 langs currently.

[11:59] <tbrowder__> calendaring with items in day cells is quite a different thing.

[12:07] <tbrowder__> m: my %h; class F {}; my $a = F.new; my $d = Date.new(now); %h{$d} = [$a]

[14:29] * [Coke] points at the barely useful "App::Cal" for the calendar discussion

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Thanks!

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To clarify: (1) I was not aware of the calendars producing modules, I searched raku.land, browsed READMEs; (2) I am interested in LLM applications for making calendars, which means I have to facilitate making those in notebooks; (3) for data science applications I need sparse calendars, that contain only some of the dates; (4) I like the "transposed" calendar layout of UNIX' ncal.

[14:50] <Voldenet> > qx<cal>

[14:51] <Voldenet> I'm a big fan of simple solutions :>

[14:51] <[Coke]> Voldenet: I basically wanted that but needed it to work on Windows

[14:52] <Voldenet> tbh. it's a solution that's hard to extend

[14:53] <Voldenet> so I guess using pure raku is better idea

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Voldenet Yeah, cal works nicely in Jupyter chatbooks for macOS (and Linux.) I was not sure about Windows.

[14:53] <[Coke]> qx<cal> or App::Cal?

[14:53] <[Coke]> ah

[14:53] <Voldenet> cal perhaps

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> How about ncal ? Does anyone here use it?

[14:54] <[Coke]> Happy to work on App::Cal more if folks find it's missing anything. Probably better windows support for highlighted text, and support for '-3' were on my list.

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> App::Cal rocks!

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well "App::Cal" is not listed in raku.land when I search with "calendar".  I should have made a Google search too, but, well, I didn't...

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Meaning, "App::Cal" needs tags in its META6.json.

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, it is cool that "App::Cal" has the "ncal" option.

[14:59] <Voldenet> I do wonder if

[14:59] <Voldenet> m: say Date.new(2023,1,1).week-number

[15:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Hi everyone, I created a new github issue over at Cro, for some reason it's unable to read the .pem files it generates: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/194

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ I have replicated this error on my mac also

[16:20] <[Coke]> antononcube: https://github.com/coke/raku-cal/issues/10

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Cool -- I was thinking to fail an issue later today.

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Now, I am forced to find and file other issued with "App::Cal".

[16:24] <[Coke]> very good.

[16:27] <[Coke]> I remember trying to support '-3' with raku default MAIN handling was challenging

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think documentation -- I will make an example README.

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Yeah, I can see that. I had to make a special "three-months" function.

[16:28] * [Coke] loves free PRs!

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ yeah, sure. I will make a PR (or 5.)

[16:30] <[Coke]> :)

[16:54] * [Coke] opens https://github.com/alabamenhu/Intl-CLDR/issues/5

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke It is satisfactory for me to show LLMs make calendars wrong. And how -- to a point -- those LLM-wrongs can be fixed.

[16:58] <[Coke]> my take is that this is a simple algorithm, and going through an LLM to do it seems the long way around.

[16:59] <[Coke]> especially if it's going to hallucinate about it

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, it is not that simple -- working with dates can be / is both complicated and boring.

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And, one of my missions, is to show that LLMs do not work and should be trusted for tasks that required precision.

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Calendars are familiar to everyone and mistakes can spotted and explained esily.

[19:40] <avuserow> librasteve: as a workaround, you could have Cro serve HTTP and run a reverse proxy in front. That's what I do for most of my deployments (caddy is super easy to get running for this)

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> good workaround - thanks!

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I suppose this is a wake up call to the community that we will need to support cro and fix priority issues (or start to remove features like TLS)

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [or perhaps we are not capable of taking on the extra load?]

[19:46] <avuserow> it looks like that module may have some tight integration with the OpenSSL module which was updated 15 days ago so maybe that's a thread to pull on

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @avuserow i was hoping that i wouldn't have to run caddy as well to just get TLS working but c'est la vie

[20:42] <[Coke]> let me try a fresh install

[20:43] <tbrowder__> ref Calendar, its current version is very old, and a WIP..

[20:44] <[Coke]> antononcube - worked fine here on 14.1.2  - can you do a gist of the error message?

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Ok, will do that.

[20:45] <tbrowder__> i will release a new  version soon that (1) works on all 3 os's and (2) has the linux 'cal' basic output but in 13 languages

[20:45] <patrickb> aruniecrisps, avuserow: There is Cro::FCGI as well. If one doesn't need websockets, then it might me a better fit than HTTP for communication with the reverse proxy

[20:45] <patrickb> And yes, we need to fix the Cro certificate issue

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke It looks like zef cannot find "Terminal::ANSIColor". Let me install it separately.

[20:47] <avuserow> regarding the cert, the dates are valid. I wonder if it's an openssl v3 thing. I would love to get more debug info from the openssl function call here.

[20:53] <[Coke]> just did a force install of Terminal::ANSIColor (it was already installed when I tried App::Cal) and it worked.

[21:27] *** vlad left
[21:28] <avuserow> okay I can't investigate any more for now but I can confirm that the cert issue happens on openssl 1.1.1w (as shipped by Debian Linux 11 bullseye)
