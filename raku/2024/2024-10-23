[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrickb: thanks - happy of course to have PR reviewed ... gotta write it first ;-) ... will revert when its ready

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (oops I meant Cro Webapp - can see that you are a contributor there)

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ... I think I was just thrown that the three People (jnthn, vendethiel, altai-man) listed for https://github.com/croservices organisation do not include expected community devs such as you or lizmat ... is there a plan to add some community devs at the croservices GH organisation level? or will all the repos in croservices be moved eg to a raku community organisation?

[15:04] <lizmat> actually, uguexe patrickbr and japhb are now also "owner" of the croservices org

[15:05] <lizmat> *ugexe

[15:05] <lizmat> *patrickb

[15:07] <lizmat> librasteve: they just haven't set the "public flag" (which I just did for myself)

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks - just didn't want to contribute back to the old edument org

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> by mistake

[15:11] <patrickb> too. Up until now I didn't know there was a public / private membership thing.

[15:22] <lizmat> weekly: https://dev.to/lizmat/raku-fall-issue-cleanup-lkc

[15:22] <notable6__> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[15:48] <ab5tract> lizmat: awesome write up!

[15:49] <lizmat> thank you  :-)

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> TL;DR: 1. Raku grammar improvements fixed 534+ Rakudo compiler issues. 2. JVM backend issues remain unresolved due to limited expertise. 3. New dispatch logic resolved many multi-method dispatch issues. 4. RakuAST project aids in fixing static optimizer-related issues. 5. 778 issues remain open; community contributions are encouraged.

[15:53] <lizmat> 4 is bogus

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am going to read the full article later....

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good to know!!

[15:54] <lizmat> RakuAST doesn't have any static optimizer issues because it doesn't have any static optimizer yet

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. I changed the prompt: 1. 534 Rakudo issues closed, reducing from 1312 to 778. 2. JVM backend issues remain unresolved due to lack of expertise. 3. New Raku dispatch logic fixed many multi-method issues. 4. RakuAST project helps resolve static optimizer issues. 5. Some issues identified as feature requests or easy fixes.

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is it better?

[15:56] <lizmat> 4 is still bogus

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is what I did:

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1298676596244217919/LLM-summary-demo-Raku-Fall-Issue-Cleanup.png?ex=671a6e54&is=67191cd4&hm=40a37e7ff065943b25779623dfef30ec2ea542dccd863406632392b41fbf992b&

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I know that LLM change (subtly) the meanings of certain important for the authors (and readers) statements. That is why I stopped utilizing summarization too agressively.

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Last attempt, with "gpt-4o-mini"): - Reviewed 1312 Rakudo compiler issues, now 778 remaining. - Closed 534 issues, some still require tests. - JVM-specific issues need contributors with JVM expertise. - Many old issues fixed due to new dispatch logic. - 289 issues identified for resolution in RakuAST.

[16:00] <lizmat> that's a much better summary

[19:29] <tonyo> anyone using fez from `main` rather than installed from eco?

[20:15] <[Coke]> main?

[20:15] <[Coke]> oh, directly from the repo? I always install with zef.

[20:15] <[Coke]> zef is the only thing I install from main.

[20:20] <tonyo> good news

[20:21] <tonyo> fez is getting some updates to handle multiple ecosystems to help testing with the raku ecosystem grant testing

[20:21] <tonyo> so you'll be able to manage which ecosystems you upload to with fez

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Sounds good.
