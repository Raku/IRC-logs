[00:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrick: i also was not aware of rakudoContainerFileBuilder

[01:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> when working with jupyter and python/rust data science libraries (raku Dan::Pandas and Dan::Polars) i ended up making https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Dockerfiles

[01:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not able to seriously compare but, off the top of my head, iirc I needed ubuntu (not alpine) due to certain Python Jupyter Pandas dependencies (and had to build raku on top of a standard python release) so may be tricky to combine them

[01:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyone is welcome to reuse these docker images and happy to take PRs

[01:22] <japhb> librasteve: What's the "time" column in the table in the raku-Dockerfiles README measuring?

[01:24] <japhb> Also, do you specifically need Ubuntu, or can you use Debian itself?

[01:28] <japhb> I feel like we may have a situation where everyone saw a need and all independently went and solved it ... I wonder how many other Rakudo container definition repos exist out there right now ....

[12:05] <tbrowder__> howdy, i remember there is a trait or something that can cache results of a sub with repeated calls on the same values.... ah: "use experimental :cached"

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I used "PDF::Extract" last night -- I did not know about poppler.

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, it was over a large PDF with the opinion of Supreme Court of the US.

[21:17] <sjn> Does raku have any methods that can resolve what letter 🇹  is? (I'd expect a "T")

[21:21] <japhb> sjn: It's just the last word of the name:  1F1F9  🇹   1   6.0  So     Common       REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER T

[21:21] <japhb> (All 26 of them follow that naming convention)

[21:24] <sjn> so use .uniname and then look for /LETTER \w/

[21:24] <sjn> thanks

[21:46] <[Coke]> (if you prefer a command line, `zef install App::Uni; uni 🇹`)
