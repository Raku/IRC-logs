[00:30] <wayland76> Just repeating my question (with slight improvements) in case it got lost in the middle of the other conversation: Is anyone able to explain why the (RakuAST-using) code in https://gist.github.com/wayland/cdf69e8b52496c5e6b1964397ad72df3 adds the parameters in the array to signature3 in an array, but when I try to flatten them in signature2, they all just disappear?

[07:57] <ab5tract> wayland76: I think you want to upshot the parameter A ast onto @astparams and pass it directly to ‘parameters’ without wrapping in another array

[07:58] <ab5tract> I’m not sure how | affects AST abject in an array. Another option is to include the parameters in @astparams one by one via index , but that’s much more brittle

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland76: as I mentioned on Discord #raku channel on 23/05 pysmt is one approach that  Python offers … if i were doing that (and i am not), i would write a raku wrapper for SMT (maybe kickstart with Inline::Python) and then spend my mental cycles on trying align it with raku Junctions (if that makes any sense at all) … anyway just a thought

[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ymmv

[09:06] <ab5tract> wayland76: please consider filing an issue for the above AST behavior. I believe your code should work as expected

[11:33] <wayland76> ab5tract: OK, will do.  Thanks!  

[11:42] <wayland76> librasteve: Interesting ideas, but I'm trying to do things more generalised than that at the moment.  I've made a note of what you said though, and maybe someday someone will build that on the foundation that I'm laying down (if I ever get it finished :p )

[11:53] <wayland76> ab5tract: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5589 Done!
