[10:01] <lizmat> guifa: if you consider a hash to be a list of pairs, the .kv on a list makes more sense?

[18:02] <lizmat> roguerakudev  what should it be then?  or do you have a Wordpress account?

[18:02] <lizmat> I could invite you then and make you the official author of that post

[18:03] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: lizmat unassigned from codesections Issue Design a command language for interactive commandline / TUI rakudo-moarvm debugger https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/456

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I don't have a wordpress account :( Could you credit it to Alexander Eubanks? I usually avoid using my real name on the net, but maybe I'm being too paranoid

[18:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Rog What is wrong with "Gorst" ?! It has "rog" in it...

[18:24] <timo> no problem crediting a pseudonym IMO

[18:24] <timo> we don't have a real-names-only policy or anything like that

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Eh, it's fine - I might link it to some people I know IRL

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I was so confused though, wondering if Jason Gorst had some kind of special meaning like John Doe ;p;

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I wonder is that a feature of WordPress -- making up random author names.

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I don't like that the IRC bridge uses by username rather than my nickname here... it's rather redundant in this channel lol

[18:35] <lizmat> roguerakudev it's credited to rogeuarakudev now

[18:36] <lizmat> I realized where I got the name from: https://github.com/roguedev

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Ahhh

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> yeah, different person :^)

[18:36] <lizmat> typo from my side

[18:36] <lizmat> yeah, realize that now, sorry for the confusion

[18:37] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> no worries

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> actually if it's not too much trouble, could you credit it to "landyacht" instead - that's my GitHub name

[18:38] <lizmat> so done  :-)

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> thanks!

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> just changed my discord name as well - unfortunately somebody stole landyacht already on here so we'll have to live with some dots

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I need to stop going by a million different aliases everywhere

[18:41] <lizmat> heh  :-)

[19:11] <guifa> I hate it when you know you need to refactor but you don't have time because of a deadline and you have to leave your code looking like crap

[19:18] <guifa> ab5tract : one thing I've noticed in CLion with the Comma plugin is if it hits an exception, it bombs on the file from there forward. Not sure on the architecture but I think on Comma standalone it would just relaunch when that happened

[19:30] <ab5tract> guidance: if you have the time, please report to the GitHub repo

[19:31] <guifa> ab5tract got it: is there anything that's particularly helpful?  I looked at the codebase in hopes I could be long term more useful to the project but ... it's a lot

[19:35] <ab5tract> I hear you! It’s not uncomplicated :)

[19:35] *** hellwolf left
[19:35] *** Guest43 joined
[19:35] <ab5tract> If it’s in Kotlin it’s a bit clearer imo, it’s also a signal of whether I’ve been hacking on that corner of the code base

[19:37] <ab5tract> In terms of helpfulness, stuff that os/cpu, and which beta release, and as much about reproducibility if possible

[19:39] <ab5tract> If you can get the stack trace that would be amazing

[19:41] *** hellwolf joined
[19:48] <ab5tract> guifa: since you mentioned it, there are two spots in Comma which could be a bit more straightforward (or at least step by step): first, the resource files that describe each intention currently contain only placeholder text

[19:49] <guifa> placeholder text would be filled in with like doc-style descriptive text?

[19:49] <ab5tract> Second, re-enabling the test suite, which would be done more less one file at a time

[19:50] <ab5tract> guifa: yeah, it’s a bit of a weird format. Some of the file contents show up in the settings page for intentions

[19:50] <guifa> I'll take a look at it as soon as I'm done with this semester

[19:51] * guifa bit off a bit more than he could chew for the scope of this project ha

[21:45] <guifa> ab5tract I definitely should have selected the group option, was supposed to keep it to 100 hours per project but definitely went overboard lol

[22:39] <guifa> is there a reason for

[22:39] <guifa> Malformed postfix call (only basic method calls that exclusively use a dot can be detached)

[22:41] <timo> hm. does unwhitespace do it?

[22:41] <timo> m: say 100  ."Str"()

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e4e226943: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed postfix call (only basic method calls that exclusively use a dot can be detached)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> say 100  .<HERE>"Str"()␤»

[22:41] <timo> m: say 100\  ."Str"()

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e4e226943: OUTPUT: «100␤»

[22:41] <timo> yeah, unwhitespace to the rescue

[22:43] <guifa> yeah that works, but I guess the question is why restrict it

[22:43] <guifa> I feel like it's one of those "easier back in the day to be fixed later" things but maybe I'm wrong

[22:45] <timo> ah, not exactly sure

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i'm looking at this and im wondering what pblock(0) means in this context, does anyone have an answer? https://github.com/mustafaaydn/Slang-Forgiven/blob/main/lib/Slang/Forgiven.rakumod#L17

[23:49] <guifa> pblock is if I remember correctly a {.... } block
