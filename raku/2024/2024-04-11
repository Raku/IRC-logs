[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> how about .slice2d(r1,r2) or .view(r1,r2)

[12:14] <tbrowder> ok, i'll use both--the more the merrier!

[12:14] <tbrowder> thnx

[12:31] <tbrowder> while i'm getting  opinions, the .shape method gives the number of matrix rows and columns, so how would you expect the return to look? i expect the return to be a list: $rows, $colums. Any other suggestions?

[13:05] <dakkar> https://docs.raku.org/routine/shape ?

[13:05] <dakkar> (this may be a completely useless suggestion)

[13:45] <tbrowder>  dakkar: thanks, i forgot (or didn't know) about that, i'll take a look. problem is when the CSV has a header i don't think that would work correctly

[13:47] *** ptc left
[13:48] <tbrowder> dakkar: looking more closely, my module deals with fixed arrays, even though you can add elements, so the @a.shape method wouldn't be useful

[13:49] <dakkar> oh, I meant, you can make your `.shape` work similarly to `Array.shape`
