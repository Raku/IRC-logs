[01:52] <ab5tract> In the linked module

[01:53] <ab5tract> But for some reason we don‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs ok to let users have access to these functions

[01:53] <ab5tract> Despite providing every means necessary required to ignore or override the provided I

[01:53] <ab5tract> implementations

[02:21] <guifa> anton: is there a way to do interactive chat with WWW::LLaMA?  I've gotten it all set up now to get responses to prompts, but not clear how to control the conversation flow  vs reseting

[02:21] <guifa> or is it just that the prompt needs to grow with old prompt ~ response ~ new prompt ?

[06:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa That can be done with a chat object (from ‚ÄúLLM::Functions‚Äù) or with a chatbook using magic cells.

[06:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For the former see : https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-LLM-Functions/blob/main/examples/Chat-with-haiku-responses.raku

[06:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For the latter , using a chatbook : there are several videos demonstrating LLM persona setup and chatting with it (via magic cells.)

[06:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure what is your LLaMA setup. Do you use chatbooks?

[13:47] <tbrowder> i guess someone could just transform that internal test to a published module...

[13:52] <ab5tract> tbrowder: https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2024-11-11.html#16:56

[13:52] <ab5tract> https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2024-11-11.html#17:16

[13:52] <ab5tract> There should be no reason to duplicate working code

[13:53] <ab5tract> But others do not agree

[14:09] <tbrowder> ok, i did see that, but in my brain fog i basically saw "fwiw, i don't either"  at least at one point--anyhow, i understand a bit about reluctance having been a  part if having some things accepted to add to core but more not.

[14:09] <tbrowder> the test thing i dunno...

[14:10] <tbrowder> *of having...

[14:11] <tbrowder> i am very happy with raku and wish we could get more traction with a wider user set

[14:16] <tbrowder> change of subject: perl and raku foundation. i was disappointed in the remarks by the board member about how deeply in debt they are and the main source of funds is from the conferences. is that true?

[14:19] <tbrowder> i can tell you i have attempted correspondence with the board several times over the years and gotten no response. in the us there are megabucks being given as grants that could be had with a little support.

[14:22] <[Coke]> trying to track down ToddAndMargo's Terminal::ANSIColor issue on windows - getting an error "failed to update fez mirror: https://360.zef.pm" on my windows box.

[14:25] <[Coke]> (on `zef update`0

[14:26] <[Coke]> if I go to that URL in chrome, opens fine.

[14:27] <[Coke]> is there a way to get verbose output about that failure?

[14:29] <ab5tract> [Coke]: maybe `zef --verbose` ?

[14:30] <ab5tract> of course you can also bypass that issue by cloning the repo directly,  but I don't think this is news to you :)

[14:31] <[Coke]> Yah, it's just a PITA on windows to do that.

[14:31] <[Coke]> (well, slightly more of one)

[14:34] <[Coke]> ah, curl https://360.zef.pm/ dies with CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK

[14:46] <[Coke]> probably need to add that self-signed cert to the OS

[14:48] <patrickb> Try disabling the AntiVirus solution.

[14:49] *** hellwolf left
[14:49] *** hellwolf joined
[14:49] <patrickb> 360.zef.pm does not use a self signed cert.

[14:54] <[Coke]> This is a corporate laptop, that's a no go

[14:54] <[Coke]> ok. then just "that cert"

[14:55] <patrickb> üëçüèº

[15:10] <[Coke]> importing the cert to windows... did nothing for the curl error

[15:14] <[Coke]> I'm still seeing a self signed cert in cert chain in the openssl output. digging...

[15:22] <ab5tract> hmm, it doesn't seem likely since it is working in Chrome but sometimes I chase my tail in similar situations only to realize that the clock is wrong

[15:32] <[Coke]> Guessing this is because I'm on a corporate laptop that probably is intercepting a bunch of stuff on my behalf.

[15:32] <patrickb> I guess curl / zef are not using the Windows cert store, but the one curl brings along. And the cert that the AV installs to introspect the traffic is only installed in the Windows store.

[15:33] <[Coke]> if I could find a way to disable the revocation check, that would probably be fine and safe here.

[15:38] <patrickb> Does your windows bring a curl with it?

[15:38] <patrickb> If so, which curl are you using in your tests?

[15:39] <patrickb> If you can modify the PATH, so it's using the Windows provided curl, that might possibly fix both curl and zef

[15:43] <patrickb> What's the output of `where curl`?

[15:52] <[Coke]> cmd doesn't have a where, one sec.

[15:53] <[Coke]> ah, it does have where, which I didn't know until just now - C:\windows\system32\curl.xe

[15:53] <[Coke]> ah, it does have where, which I didn't know until just now - C:\windows\system32\curl.exe

[15:53] <[Coke]> I meant, it doesn't have `which`, which I auto-translated your ask into in my brain. whoops

[15:57] <ab5tract> [Coke]: if you can run powershell instead of cmd, I'd expect it to save you some sanity

[15:58] <[Coke]> I switch back and forth. also have git bash

[16:00] *** yewscion joined
[16:00] <ab5tract> yesterday I learned that there is an option when install git bash that one can specify that bypasses the whole is-no-true-TTY issue

[16:01] <ab5tract> apparently you can click a checkbox that makes it wrap around either cmd or powershell instead of the GNU option

[16:03] <patrickb> Ok. Then it's already using the windows native curl. Then my idea was a red hering.

[16:09] <[Coke]> trying https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-completely-disable-certificate-revocation/1b0fcf24-9a10-427b-b2c5-e1e29d54c02e

[16:11] <[Coke]> \p/

[16:11] <[Coke]> er, \o/

[16:11] <[Coke]> though I guess I have a neck in that first emoticon.

[16:12] <[Coke]> ... damn. that fixes *curl*. it doesn't fix zef.

[16:13] <[Coke]> AHH. no. I tested on cmd pre-reboot, and powershell post-reboot. it changed nothing. :|

[16:13] <[Coke]> (zef fails in powershell also, even though curl direct works)

[16:18] <[Coke]> can't install zef HEAD on my box with 2024.07+

[16:18] <[Coke]> error while compiling zef\CLI.rakumod at CLI.rakumod line 2

[16:22] <[Coke]> src\moar.h "cannot open inclue file dynload.h"

[16:24] <[Coke]> guessing so far this is just my old windows install needing to be nuked and done over. :|

[16:25] <ab5tract> [Coke]: hmm, perhaps... though the compilation story is actually better on older Windows if IIRC?

[16:25] <ab5tract> which compiler are you using?

[16:26] <[Coke]> cl reports 19.29.30139

[16:26] <ab5tract> msvc?

[16:26] <[Coke]> (in the x64 native tools command prompt)

[16:26] <[Coke]> y

[16:28] <[Coke]> doing a fresh build with 2024.10 rakudo tag

[16:28] <[Coke]> nuked nqp/moarvm source

[16:29] <[Coke]> ... I was just trying to answer toddandmargo's ansi question. :)

[16:29] <ab5tract> :)

[16:30] <ab5tract> hmm, I don't recall the "compiler cutoff"

[16:30] <[Coke]> funny error: "macro expansion producing 'defined' has undefined behavior"

[16:30] <ab5tract> but it *might* be 2018, where your version seems to be 2019

[16:31] <[Coke]> I've used 2019 before.

[16:31] <ab5tract> ok

[16:31] <[Coke]> I've never updated it on this PC.

[16:31] <[Coke]> I just haven't built on windows in months; (I did upgrade to win11 at some point)

[16:32] <ab5tract> the win11 upgrade is probably not an issue...

[16:32] <ab5tract> but I could not get a working compilation starting already in Windows ~2-3 years ago

[16:33] <[Coke]> I do wonder why it's using a lib in program files (x86) when I'm in the x64 build cmd.exe

[16:34] <ab5tract> that's definitely suspicious

[16:34] <[Coke]> we seem to have gotten further after nuking nqp/moar and using the release tag.

[16:34] <ab5tract> or rather, that definitely *feels* suspicious

[16:37] *** yewscion joined
[16:37] <[Coke]> yah, into nqp now

[16:42] <[Coke]> ... and now strawberry perl.exe is dying "return code 0xff' after the stage start: 0.000 output

[16:42] <[Coke]> (in rakudo biuld)

[16:45] <ab5tract> ufff
