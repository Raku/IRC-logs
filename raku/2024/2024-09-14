[11:00] <Xliff> I've been up for a while now working on my Raku app server. I've been trying to release this thing for months now.

[11:03] <wayland76> Today, I've started working on a Raku version of https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot

[11:12] <tea3po> Pythagoras was a cult leader.  they worshiped the square root of two.

[11:16] <wayland76> My typing will suck soon too -- I'm receiving the black version of https://www.zsa.io/moonlander soon :) .

[11:22] <timo> split keyboards are so much fun

[11:23] *** [Coke]_ left
[11:23] <wayland76> Good to hear.  This will be my first :) .  

[11:24] <Xliff> Oooh! That looks luscious! How much was it?

[11:25] <wayland76> The one that came closest to meeting all my criteria was the Naya Create, but it was also almost double the price, so I decided to try this first, and then if it's a direction I want to go, then I'll look at others.  

[11:26] <Xliff> Can I haz your cast offs? I provide a good home for unwanted hardware. ;)

[11:27] <wayland76> Like $365 for the keyboard, and another $110? for the stands (optional, but I thought I should get them -- I'm trying to relieve persistent upper back tension)

[11:29] <wayland76> Xliff: worth an ask, but I have plans for the cast-offs too.  For example, one for work, one for home.  Then my church has a sound system which is currently using a laptop as a partial interface, and I'd like to change that.  Even the keyboard I'm using now (Microsoft media keyboard) has Greek and Hebrew stickers on it, so I'll be keeping it as a second keyboard for this computer.  

[11:31] <timo> i have an elora, i like it a bunch

[11:32] <wayland76> Other honourable mentions go to Keyboard.io Model 100 (most aesthetic -- https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-100?srsltid=AfmBOoq49EVUgtHC6tqaAPEONj7DgGZpZ8OvcMpxkXpA9icaqFbygFyI ) and CloudNine ErgoFS (most familiar -- https://cloudnineergo.com/products/cloud-nine-c989m-ergonomic-keyboard#product_buy_box )

[11:34] <ab5tract> landed on a UHK myself, never had any complaints

[11:36] <tea3po> I use a unicomp model m.  I don't understand people that don't 10-key

[11:36] <wayland76> timo: Oh, nice!  I hadn't seen that one, but looks like it also meets most of my criteria at a good price.  

[11:37] <patrickb> I've been. using a moonlander for 3? years or so now with a custom layout. I like it a lot.

[11:39] <timo> the elora has been released just this year

[11:40] <wayland76> The Elora reminds me of the Iris, but with more flexibility.  

[11:41] <timo> i had a kyria before the elora, which is elora minus number row, and minus the extension interface and footswitch input, and plus mandatory soldering

[11:41] <wayland76> I was using an Avant Stellar with my current MS keyboard as a backup, but never replaced it when the shift key died.  I also have a mechanical keyboard where the keycaps have removable plastic covers so you can put in your own paper labels, but never quite got around to rigging it up.  

[11:42] <wayland76> Elora has a footswitch?  I don't see it, and what do you use it for?  

[11:44] <wayland76> tea3po: The New Model M doesn't seem to have tenkey?  

[11:45] <tea3po> I don't like the taste of New Coke either

[11:45] <wayland76> patrickb: Good to hear!  I'm surprised how many people here are actually using split keyboards.  

[11:45] <tea3po> alternate answer:  it's fine I guess, if you're into that sort of thing

[11:46] <timo> wayland76: it's a TRRS plug where bridging each of the three available contacts to the sleeve contact is registered as a "key down" essentially

[11:46] <timo> it does not come with footswitches, and i don't think the shop that made the elora sells footswitches either

[11:48] <wayland76> tea3po: Let me rephrase -- I've been Googling the things that people are saying, and didn't find a Model M with tenkeys.  But I looked harder and found one :) .  

[11:48] <tea3po> unicomp should have the original model m, I think they still use the original molds and stuff.  they have some variations and updates too.

[11:49] <tea3po> it was expensive tbh, like $120 quite a few years ago, but worth it to me.  it's obv. a personal preference tho

[11:49] <wayland76> tea3po: OK, good to know :) .  

[11:49] <tea3po> it's real buckling spring switches.

[11:50] <wayland76> Well, my Avant Stellar was like $200 quite a few years ago, and I was annoyed because they'd removed the macro key, so I rarely made use of the macros.  

[11:51] <wayland76> tea3po: yeah, my Moonlander will have that too.  I went for the Cherry MX Blue switches.  

[11:52] <wayland76> (the point of my Avant Stellar being $200 was that I can relate :) ).  

[11:52] <tea3po> so, cherry mx blue is a simulation of buckling spring switches, they're not the same thing tho, we can chat about it in pm if you want

[11:54] <wayland76> timo: I've found the footswitch reference, right there on the main page ( https://splitkb.com/products/elora?srsltid=AfmBOoodYeCmO2GHSKlQsqw73LEImTrzXzoOngKcHmbVBP2yFWPMn6xm ).  Thanks!  I wouldn't've seen it had you not mentioned it.  

[11:55] <timo> the interface is generic so it can be any kind of switch or other thing you can think up, though i'm not sure if you can actually power a little gadget from just that plug, would have to investigate

[12:00] *** sena_kun joined
[12:00] <wayland76> Oh, one more honourable mention that I didn't see until after I bought my moonlander Magnetic (hall effect) switches that can do different things depending how hard you press them ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keytron/keychron-k2-he-mechanical-keyboard-with-magnetic-switches?ref=ckykwu&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw6JS3BhBAEiwAO9waF35xsd04tGKFqSMxEDOl5qX6iYEbsODaV0jqPy9XP59ecpDr8j5vHhoCycsQAvD_BwE )

[12:01] <wayland76> timo: Yeah, it sounds cool; I'm just trying to figure out if I'd have a use for it.  I wonder whether stenographers would too :) .  

[12:05] <timo> the splitkb guy is actually also working on a steno keyboard of his own

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no problem - so pleased happy to be lab rat

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw spent a while holding back all IJ and plugin updates so as not to loose Comma plugin since that was lagging the curve

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or both

[18:10] <ab5tract> I don’t think setting that lower will work

[18:11] <ab5tract> are you doing :runIde?

[18:13] <ab5tract> I wonder whether there is some prompt inside of IntelliJ related to kotlin version or grade IntelliJ platform plugin that hasn’t popped up for you

[18:14] <ab5tract> It’s supposed to be pretty automatic regarding those things :/

[18:15] <ab5tract> Ah! You might need to install the Dev-Kit plugin

[18:22] <ab5tract> The only other thing I can think of to check is whether you have a 21+ compiler set

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5stract I clone the CommaIDE repository -- how am I supposed to build it? Via IntelliJ ?

[18:28] <ab5tract> indeed. you'll want IntelliJ 2024.2

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sorry -- I read the intstructions in the README more carefully just now...

[18:29] <ab5tract> no worries, it seems that those intructions will need some more steps and details, as they didn't work for librasteve as written

[18:32] <ab5tract> but please go ahead and give it a shot, maybe we can figure out what's missing :)

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is importing and downloading for the last 5-7 min.

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - when I go runIde I get this ^^ sea of red

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i am also not sure of best practice hear ... maybe i can install the newly built comma plugin?

[20:13] <ky> m: say "this\nthat"

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar dde756878: OUTPUT: «this␤that␤»

[20:14] <ky> i needed the ␤ symbol and this is the place i remember it was used.

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> haha - i just grabbed and added to my (mac) emoji favourites - thanks

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5stract: now I have successfully built the plugin, please can you explain how I can just go "install plugin from disk" ... is the plugin file stored somewhere on my local drive after this build?

[20:30] <ab5tract> librasteve: I believe it's in build/libs

[20:30] <ab5tract> but I've never needed to do that

[20:31] <ab5tract> I wouldn't call 20 or so WARNs a "sea of red", fwiw

[20:31] <ab5tract> but maybe I'm biased after the battles I've waged getting it running :)

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/GitWorld/comma-plugin/build/distributions/comma-2.0.zip

[20:36] <ab5tract> distributions makes more sense, nice find

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok -- great progress and i think there is a clutch of us that are really keen to get this over the line

[20:38] <ab5tract> still not sure what's going on with your `:runIde` target, though. if the plugin works when installed, it should launch a sandboxed ide with the plugin install as well :S

[20:41] <ab5tract> antononcube: jvm22 is what I'm using

[20:44] <ab5tract> I guess it couldn't hurt to to do the equivalent of "turn off/turn on" for IntelliJ: invalidate caches and rebuild project

[20:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I decided to get busy putting-in and experimenting with the new, reasoning models of ChatGPT: "o1-mini" and "o1-preview".

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Unfortunately, they are available only for tier 5 accounts (with OpenAI.) Anyway, those models can be accessed with "WWW::OpenAI:ver<0.3.5>".

[20:51] <MasterDuke> ab5tract: linux/x86-64

[20:51] <ab5tract> MasterDuke: ah! so did everything just snap together after adjusting `build.gradle.kts`?

[20:52] <MasterDuke> yep

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yay! its working - v. cool & many thanks

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I think my runIde was working but --- the syntax colour is (i) different to CommaIDE and (ii) was not fully loaded when I tried ... I am wrestling with where to set the raku compiler

[20:56] <ab5tract> it should prompt you to set the Raku SDK when you create a project

[20:56] *** [Coke]_ joined
[21:02] <MasterDuke> i was going to ask about that too, it didn't. i could create a raku project (script worked, but module might not have), but there wasn't an obvious sdk setting

[21:02] <MasterDuke> but afk now

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - I found it under (main menu bar > tools > set raku sdk)

[21:02] <MasterDuke> thanks, i'll check there later

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ab5tract: kudos!

[21:11] <ab5tract> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ScP9ak39/project%20sdk.png

[21:11] <ab5tract> There's a display bug there

[21:11] <ab5tract> with previously declared SDKs

[21:11] <ab5tract> fixing it now
