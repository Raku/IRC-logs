[10:22] <lizmat> librasteve: the closest thing to private multi methods are lexical multi subs.  But that doesn't give you direct access to the attributes

[10:22] <lizmat> however, you could pass the invocant as the first argument like so:

[10:23] <lizmat> multi sub foo($self, $bar) { $self.method($bar) }

[10:23] <lizmat> multi sub foo($self, $bar) { $self.attribute }

[18:02] <melezhik> o/

[18:02] <melezhik> my cro application (sparky) consumes way too much CPU even being idle, is typical for cro?

[18:02] <melezhik> is -> is it

[18:03] <melezhik> basically here is the code - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/bin/sparky-web.raku

[18:04] <melezhik> maybe web sockets do that?
