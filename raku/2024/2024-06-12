[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> My job is pretty awful at the moment so I'm applying elsewhere

[14:42] <lizmat> meh, sorry to hear

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it is what it is

[14:43] <[Coke]> good luck.

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I wish i had more time to continue my side project, but now I'm looking for other jobs at the moment

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> @antononcube I replied from discord to your last phrase , but your quote did not appear in irc log …

[17:12] <tbrowder> [Coke]: lucky!

[17:15] <tbrowder> the other day you mentioned forking Text::Wrap. i’m happy to do that but i’m reluctant because that’s kind of like hijacking. i wish the author would respond

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Anyone know what the default batch and degree values are for race?

[17:22] *** sena_kun joined
[17:22] <ugexe> m: say ().race.raku

[17:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8518cc49f: OUTPUT: «RaceSeq.new(configuration => HyperConfiguration.new(batch => 64, degree => 3))␤»

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> thanks

[17:23] <ugexe> depends on your system, but that is how you can see it

[17:25] <[Coke]> I know I was arguing against taking more community modules earlier, but Text::Wrap in particular already has 2 implementations in the wild.

[17:25] <[Coke]> though codesections has also been quiet lately, he might respond better to tickets, and then you can change downstream to rely on his instead.

[17:28] <[Coke]> I see no issues on https://github.com/jkramer/p6-Text-Wrap/issues

[17:28] <[Coke]> How are you trying to ping the author?

[17:30] <[Coke]> (I do see a ticket from you on https://github.com/codesections/_/issues but it's not about T::W specifically)

[18:12] <tbrowder> oh, sorry, getting the graph req confused. i had emailed text::wrap author. looking again…

[18:16] <tbrowder> alright, i planned to email jkramer*, is that codesections? i had started a pr but haven’t submitted it yet.

[18:31] <[Coke]> no, jkramer is Text::Wrap, codesections is _ (which contains another Text::Wrap)

[18:31] <[Coke]> (the first has the distro & the module with the same name, the latter has separate names)

[20:00] <SmokeMachine> Hi you all! is Peter Krawczyk here?!

[20:06] <SmokeMachine> is there someone from the Perl and Raku conference here? I just saw my talk was cancelled and I already have flight tickets bought to go (by my employer). I'm having some problems verifying my email and haven't seen the warning before...

[20:13] <tonyo> ingy: ^^ ??

[20:17] <SmokeMachine> just to make it clear, that was my fault to not read the confirmation email to click on the confirmation link and not see the warning email... but I would be really thankful if the confirmation could be reverted

[20:56] <ugexe> i've talked to Peter via the email treasurer@perlfoundation.org before

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Sorry to hear that.

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But, well, giving presentations in Las Vegas is a gamble.

[20:59] <SmokeMachine> He have answered me by the papercall site
