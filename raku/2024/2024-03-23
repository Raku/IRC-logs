[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... unfortunately that sigil interpretation does not "scale": - & is for &unction, because it represents a function or subroutine - * is for *bject, as it signifies an object or reference in the code - # is for #ash, symbolizing a hash or hash table data structure - ~ is for ~tring, it represents text manipulation - ^ is for ^ower, it denotes exponentiation operations

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> > so I like £ is for £ogic, plus it’s easy to type on my keyboard 🙂 The currency symbols do scale though 🙂 : - ¥ is for ¥ield, representing the return value of a function - € is for €xpression, denoting a mathematical or logical operation - ₽ is for ₽rocess, indicating a specific process or thread within a program - ₹ is for ₹esult, showing the outcome of a computation or operation - ¢ is

[14:40] <notna> hi @all. whom to talk to about rakudo/docker and the outdated Star docker container? would be great if someone gets in touch at https://github.com/Raku/docker/issues/57

[14:40] <tellable6> 2023-01-19T21:52:33Z #raku-dev <patrickb> notna: I seem to recall, that rba once built the DMG images. (Or was it Coke?)

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I would like to have readily available a few Web page importing functions and text statistics functions. For example, a sub import that imports content of web page or a file. If a

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If the first argument to import is URL, then properties like <html xml plaintext> can be additionally specified. If the first argument is a file path, then the content of the file is slurped. Etc.

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Does a Raku package/module with similar mission or functionalities exist? If not, what is a good name for such module?

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I consider "Data::Import" -- seems generic enough.

[14:51] <lizmat> not sure about the distribution name, but maybe it should just export "slurp" candidates ?

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Hmm... very interesting idea...

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My motivation is getting inputs for LLMs faster, be those (plain-)text, images, JSON- or CSV data. Is having "slurps" for all of those be considered confusing?

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> *Would...

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat "Data::Slurps" sounds good. 🙂

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugexe I am somewhat ignorant about full spectrum of the "IO::*" hierarchies and functionalities, so, for me, "IO::Streamable" and "IO::Readable::Encoded" are "just" role designs.

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, if I  "just want concrete file or URL content at hand", function names like "import", "import-url", "import-image" are much clearer of what I would get if I use them.

[15:12] *** notna left
[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I would say that utilizing and acting upon a design like "IO::Readable::Encoded" will require much more understanding and implementation effort that what I am currently inclined to do.

[16:52] <guifa> X operator is lazy right?

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is crossy for sure.

[16:53] <lizmat> m: ((1,2,3) X (4,5,6)).iterator.is-lazy.say

[16:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[16:55] <lizmat> m: ((1,2,3 ... *) X (4,5,6 ... *)).iterator.is-lazy.say

[16:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:55] <lizmat> depends on the underlying iterators

[16:55] <guifa> ah dang

[16:55] <guifa> For something I'm doing I wanted to have a big giant loop

[16:56] <lizmat> m: ((1,2,3).lazy X (4,5,6)).iterator.is-lazy.say

[16:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:56] <lizmat> add .lazy ?

[16:56] <guifa> ah that might work

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I want to be sure what you proposed earlier -- like the following right?  slurp('https://pypi.org/project/ChernoffFace/', 'plaintext')

[16:57] <guifa> m: my @a = <a b c>; my @b = 1,2,3; my @c = [@a,@b]; ([X] |@c).iterator.is-lazy.say

[16:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[16:57] <guifa> m: my @a = <a b c>; my @b = 1,2,3; my @c = [@a,@b]; ([X] |@c).say

[16:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «((a 1) (a 2) (a 3) (b 1) (b 2) (b 3) (c 1) (c 2) (c 3))␤»

[16:57] <lizmat> antononcub yes, but with the 'plaintext' arg as a named: slurp('https://pypi.org/project/ChernoffFace/', :plaintext)

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Or for an image file: slurp('~/Downloads/scene.png')

[16:57] <guifa> m: my @a = <a b c>; my @b = 1,2,3; my @c = [@a,@b]; ([X] |@c).lazy.is-lazy.say

[16:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I currently have it is named and positional. I think I prefer to have a more general named argument ":$prop". (That can be "plaintext" or "html" or Whatever.)

[16:59] <lizmat> :format<plaintext>

[17:00] <guifa> nope just tagging on .lazy doesn't work =/

[17:00] <guifa> I guess [X] forcibly consumes 

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, :$format is better.

[17:01] <guifa> m: my @a = lazy 0, { say "^{$_ + 1}"; $_ + 1 } ... 3; my @b = lazy 'a', { say "+{$_.succ}"; $_.succ } ... 'd'; my @c = [@a,@b]; ([X] |@c).lazy.is-lazy.say;

[17:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:01] <guifa> or wait did this get changed?

[17:01] <guifa> oooooh

[17:02] <guifa> my @a = lazy 0, { say "^{$_ + 1}"; $_ + 1 } ... 3; my @b = lazy 'a', { say "+{$_.succ}"; $_.succ } ... 'd'; my @c = [@a,@b]; ([X] |@c).say;

[17:02] <evalable6> guifa, rakudo-moar 18abe8c32: OUTPUT: «(...)␤»

[17:02] <guifa> okay sweet.  this will make my logical programming go MUCH nicer

[17:03] <lizmat> :-)

[17:03] <guifa> (after all,that's basically all it does)

[17:03] *** jpn joined
[17:04] <guifa> drills through all of the candidates and moves to the next combination as soon as something doesn't fit

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, I am deciding the create a package "Data::Slurps", but I want to keep it (relatively) lightweight. For example, I do not want its installation to depend on "Text::CSV" or "PDF::Extract", but if those packages are installed already they would be used. Is this, generally speaking, a good idea?

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, users would find it misleading.

[17:06] <guifa> I think it's fine.  Just present a warning if you encounter a file you can't handle, and explain options for opening it

[17:06] <lizmat> antononcube  App::Rak has optional dependencies,  and there is an App::Rak::Complete dist that will also install all of the optional dependencies

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok. If someone complains, I will point "App::Rak" to them.

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And, yes, "Data::Slurps::Complete" is a very good idea!
