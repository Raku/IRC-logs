[08:13] <patrickb> ugexe, [Coke]: This is the straw that breaks the camels back. I'll push the refactor of termios to not use a C component to the top of my to-do list.

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> So I have a grammar acting more or less like a tokenizer, and the TOP rule is something like <command-name> <.ws> <token>* % <.ws>

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> now, one possible token is a quoted string, to allow the user to enter strings containing space

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> which looks like \' ~ [<!after \\> \'] $<contents>=.*?

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I've tried making both regex rather than token, but no dice

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I also tried making $<contents> greedier by getting rid of the ?, but also to no avail

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> maybe there's some special optimization going on with % that prevents this?

[21:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @roguerakudev Does your grammar work if you change the separator from white space to something else, like. comma?

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Good call - with that the reported error is that parse wanted 2 positional but got 0...

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I ran into the same issue before where input that wasn't grammatical had that reported error, which is odd

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I updated to the latest rakudo after that, but I guess that didn't fix anything haha

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I think that error at least is a bug, because parse doesn't even want 2 positionals, it wants one and maybe a named actions argument

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Well, I suppose it's a method so maybe the invocant counts as the first

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> but even so, there is definitely input being passed in

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Rog It is hard for me to reason about that grammar with seeing all of it...

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> let me get a minimal reproduction togethere

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> in doing so I might solve my own problem

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> okay, so without an actions class, I can't seem to reproduce the weird error message

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> it's just returning (Any) now, which is still not what I'd expect, even using comma as a delimiter

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> https://hastebin.com/share/daxajucojo.xml

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> consider the input "string,'str ing'"

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @Rog - looks like you are reinventing this wheel - https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Modified_quantifier:_%,_%%

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see : > We're sorry, but the contents of the bin could not be found, or it has been deleted.

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Well shoot

[23:55] <SmokeMachine> Hi! We were discussing about value classes here on TPRC, and I  started playing with it... I'd like to know opinion about other people about it... this is just a PoC and has no tests... could some one take a look? https://github.com/FCO/ValueClass

[23:55] <SmokeMachine> ^^ guifa

[23:56] <guifa> Also can I mention how awesome it's been to meet up with the Raku folk ILR?  Hopefully next conference more people can pop in
