[13:55] <dutchie> m: 'foo' ~~ /bar/ | /foo/; say $/ # is there a way to get the match out of an any-junction like this?

[13:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar dce688d43: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§¬ª

[13:59] <lizmat> m: $/ = 42; "foo" ~~ /foo/ | /bar/; say $/

[13:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar dce688d43: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[14:00] <lizmat> dutchie: the problem is that the junction handling code's scope is hiding the $/, so the "local" $/ is not affected

[14:00] *** derpydoo joined
[14:01] <lizmat> and even if it weren't, the junction handling will do each match in a random order, so you would never know from which eigenstate the $/ would be set

[14:12] <dutchie> i guess i should just match against /foo|bar/ instead, duh

[14:19] <lizmat> yeah, that would probably be better :-)

[14:20] <lizmat> although the syntax looks similar, | in a regex actually does longest token matching

[14:20] <lizmat> m: say "foo" ~~ / f | fo | foo /

[14:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 68628fe35: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢fooÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[14:20] *** jpn joined
[14:21] <lizmat> if you want the first match, you'd use || instead of |

[14:21] <lizmat> m: say "foo" ~~ / f || fo || foo /

[14:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 68628fe35: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢fÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[14:21] <lizmat> dutchie ^^

[14:27] <dutchie> the matches are completely disjoint so not sure which of || and | is better, or whether it makes no difference

[14:27] <lizmat> if they are disjoint, it doesn't matter

[14:28] <lizmat> but it they aren't, it does... and I thought I'd point out the difference  :-)

[14:28] <lizmat> since it looks like you're experimenting with Raku regexes

[14:35] <dutchie> yeah, makes sense. :)

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> dutchie: you can also employ an Array of Str as a Regex like this

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ or like this (I just discovered)

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> When an array variable is interpolated into a regex, the regex engine handles it like a | alternative of the regex elements https://docs.raku.org/syntax/Regex%20Interpolation

[20:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Python and perl are actually pretty much exactly the same - analogous to the Judean People's Liberation front versus the People's Liberation front of Judea. However the languages are optimised for a slightly different purpose. Python helps you to think more like the computer does, whereas perl helps the computer to think more like you do. from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39731960#39734909

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sounds like some sort of and an excuse for the Py-curious to (be enticed to) work with Python.

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Very different from TIMTOWTDI ...)

[21:28] <ptc> crazy thing I just noticed: there are two File::Zip distributions from two different authors (see https://raku.land/?q=File%3A%3AZip)

[21:29] <ptc> how is it possible to choose a particular one?

[21:29] <ptc> if I just use `zef install File::Zip` I get the dist I don't want :-/

[21:30] <ptc> is it possible to tell zef "don't use that one"?

[21:30] <ptc> is there maybe some extra bit of metainfo that I can append to the dist name to the `zef install` call to get the right thing?

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ptc Yes, use "ver<0.1.1>" and/or "auth:<zef:someone>".

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ptc For example:  File::Zip:ver<0.1.2>:auth<gitlab:tyil>:api<0>

[21:35] <gfldex> ptc: have a look at `zef search File::Zip`. It will show you the full names of all available distributions of that name.

[21:39] <ptc> gfldex: yup, I tried that. The dist I want is the one without all of the extra metadata, i.e. the one without a version number :-/  Consequently, it's not clear what to give to zef as just `File::Zip` picks File::Zip:ver<0.1.2>:auth<gitlab:tyil>:api<0>, which turns out to be the one I don't want

[21:39] <ptc> I'll give the "auth:<zef:someone>" suggestion a go and see if that works

[21:43] <gfldex> ptc: that's a zef bug. The proper name is in "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json".

[21:43] <ptc> unfortunately, no luck: zef install 'File::Zip:auth<github:azawawi>'                                                           ‚îÇTest Summary Report

[21:43] <ptc> ===> Searching for: File::Zip:auth<github:azawawi>                                                        ‚îÇ-------------------

[21:44] <ptc> No candidates found matching identity: File::Zip:auth<github:azawawi>

[21:44] <ptc> using 'File::Zip:auth<zef:azawawi>' also doesn't work :-/

[21:46] <ptc> gfldex: the real issue is that I want to use Selenium::WebDriver and that dist uses the File::Zip that I'm after.

[21:46] <gfldex> zef can't find any distribution that got ":ver<*>" in its name.

[21:47] <ptc> maybe I just need to look for a different solution

[21:47] <ptc> gfldex: yeah, that's what I thought.  Maybe I need to push a patch to fix that.

[21:48] <ptc> thanks for your help :-)

[21:48] <gfldex> please file an issue at https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues

[21:57] <ptc> I'll give that a go tomorrow

[21:57] <ptc> It seems I'm not the first to have spotted this issue: https://github.com/azawawi/raku-selenium-webdriver/issues/27

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> zef -v install https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-file-zip.git should do the trick (per the issue) ... are you on macOS? if so I am curious to hear if/how you succeed in the light of my issue https://github.com/azawawi/raku-selenium-webdriver/issues/28

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ptc: zef -v install https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-file-zip.git should do the trick (per the issue) ... are you on macOS? if so I am curious to hear if/how you succeed in the light of my issue https://github.com/azawawi/raku-selenium-webdriver/issues/28

[22:10] <ptc> librasteve: no, I'm on Debian. I cloned the git repo and used `zef install .` (which is basically the same as using the URL, I guess). Am now strugging with Selenium::Webdriver.  Perhaps I should go to bed... ;-)

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> @librasteve & ptc: zef install 'File::Zip:ver<99>'would install the one you want. Basically any number except that of the other distro
