[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/ is there an idiomatic way to declare alias(es) with has?

[11:52] <SmokeMachine> how do you want to use that alias? on constructor? If that's the case, maybe something like this?

[11:52] *** ky1 left
[11:52] <SmokeMachine> m: class C { has $.a; method TWEAK(:$b, |) { $!a = $b } }; say C.new: :42b

[11:54] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: ☝️

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for the fb - not really ... I had in mind something like has $.s($.server);

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the has declaration

[11:56] <lizmat> librasteve this recently came up in one of leont's issues

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I know (from the docs), I can go

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  class EncodedBuffer {     has $.enc;     has $.data;       submethod BUILD(:encoding(:$!enc), :$!data) { } } 

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/language/objects#Attributes

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I can go with that for now

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> actually just gonna tie it close to where I need the abbreviation

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  my $s := $.server; my $proc = Proc::Async.new: :w, qqw|ssh -p {$s.port} -tt -i {$s.key-path} {$s.login}|; 

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (spose I could use a topicalizer)

[12:15] <lizmat> librasteve I was thinking of syntax such as:  has $.foo is built(:as<bar>)

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaaay

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sub alias-named(:color(:$colour), :type(:class($kind))) {}

[12:19] <lizmat> has $.foo is built(:as<bar baz>) perhaps?

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> what about something more like Capture syntax?

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> has $.foo is built is aliased(:bar(:baz($)));

[12:22] *** ky1 left
[12:23] *** ky1 joined
[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyway I don't really mind an I know that syntax is hard ... so leave it to you

[14:01] <knarkhov> Hi, friends! I'm struggling with NativeCall. On C-side I have a function with FILE input arg: int process(FILE *filehandle) {...}. On Raku side I opened a filehandle via IO::Handle and now it's a problem to pass to native C-function. Any help is very appreciated.

[14:02] *** Sgeo joined
[14:03] *** ky1 left
[14:03] *** ky1 joined
[14:04] <knarkhov> All good if I use a wrapper on C-side: int wrap_process(char *filename) { ... fp = fopen(fname, "r"); process(fp); ... }, but I need that stuff on Raku-side cause of external C-library

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kharkov Do you have a gist (or pastebin) with that code?

[14:08] *** euandreh left
[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kharkov I find / found the NativeCall Raku packages by Itsuki Toyota very instructive. For example, see: https://github.com/titsuki/raku-Algorithm-KdTree

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ... aka @titsuki ...

[14:12] *** ky1 left
[14:13] *** ky1 joined
[14:14] <knarkhov> in my case, as I can imagine, FILE is actually a struct in C, so I have to define it as a CStruct class, map IO::Handle to it somehow and then get a pointer via nativecast.

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See the "Algorithm::KdTree" linked above -- it does C-structs and corresponding accessor  functions in Raku.

[14:19] <knarkhov> here's the module: https://gitlab.com/pheix/raku-node-ethereum-kzg/-/blob/main/lib/Node/Ethereum/KZG.rakumod

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kharkhov I can take a closer look after 4-5 hours...

[14:22] *** ky1 left
[14:23] <knarkhov> it will be great! Thank you! I will post and update if I will get it working.

[14:23] *** ky1 joined
[14:31] <ugexe> you could pass the file descriptor

[14:32] <ugexe> i dunno if that is ideal or not

[14:32] <ugexe> my $handle = "foo/bar/baz".IO.open; $handle.native-descriptor

[14:42] <knarkhov> @ugexe, that was what I have tried in the beginning and got segfault. The problem is that C-func expects *FILE as pointer, but .native-descriptor gives int, so I have to "pack" to CArray and get a Pointer from it (similar to & in C): my $fhptr = nativecast(Pointer, CArray[int64].new($fh.native-descriptor));

[14:42] <knarkhov> but that gives segfault as well((((

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @kharkhov Sorry for advicing methodology instead of giving concrete code... But if you have IntelliJ's CLion you can use it together with the plugin comma-2.0. CLion has linter(s) built-in and can give you hints where the C-code might fail.

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The C-code in your GitLab repository is simple, but still, CLion-with-Comma might be useful.

[15:12] *** ky1 left
[15:13] *** ky1 joined
[15:20] <knarkhov> honestly, I have just noticed - my $fhptr = nativecast(Pointer, CArray[int64].new($fh.native-descriptor)); works 1/10 times - I got my test passed at some moment: https://gitlab.com/pheix/raku-node-ethereum-kzg/-/jobs/8189938968. So the approach with .native-descripto works, but bug is still there, I'm investigating... Thank you, I will ping you back on my new findings.

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hi folks - I'm off to the London Perl Raku Workshop tomorrow and the number of raku presentations is much lower than the number of perl ones ...  https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/schedule?day=2024-10-26

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Please let me know if there is anything I should consider conveying to the wider perl / raku community ... I guess I will try to major on 6.e progress wrt to RakuAST is anyone asks how Raku is progressing...

[15:54] <knarkhov> @ugexe, @antononcube, I got it working, 100x load/free are passed well: https://gitlab.com/pheix/raku-node-ethereum-kzg/-/jobs/8190238068#L458. The changes I've done: just opened file in bin mode on Raku side, slurp all its content to CArray, did CArray to Pointer nativecast and voala - it worked! Here's the diff: https://gitlab.com/pheix/raku-node-ethereum-kzg/-/commit/3158f58d8e92e4f559a42fe894c29da9ea262f95#3b349a7abba215472d3b8db1e9d573ad467a18a8_31_30

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Let me think -- I should have something like that. (But lately, I have been more active making Raku-related movies, not som much posts.)

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve When do you need this slide/page? Today or, say, by the end of the week?

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cool - the session is tomorrow (Sat) UK time

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> don't make anything new (unless you want) ... even a "search google antononcube raku llm" would be cool

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh, ok. I will make a initial version today. It is probably going to be based on some answers I gave on Reddit/r/rakulang.

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well. Raku RAG is pretty new and important. Same with Sparse Matrices (with named rows and columns.)

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (This week, I have been working on a presentation for latter, BTW.)
