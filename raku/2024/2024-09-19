[07:26] <ab5tract> librasteve++, that‚Äôs a pretty convincing example imo

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Why am I up at this time? (03:32), and still drinking?

[07:34] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> But I agree with ab5tract.

[07:40] <ab5tract> So you‚Äôre still awake and sober enough to have a good opinion;)

[07:40] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Barely enough, yeah üôÇ

[07:53] <Xliff> I wanna do that. I has brandy!

[07:53] <Xliff> And it's been a bad enough day.

[07:54] <Xliff> When I try and do .^can(<method-name>).map( *.file.gist ) and all of the returned options are "SETTING::src/core.c/stubs.rakumod".."()" .... something is wrong

[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Careful with brandy, I has only beer, and drinking slowly makes it easier.

[07:55] <Xliff> It appears I am too early in requesting this data. Is there a workaround?

[15:07] <ab5tract> antononcube, librasteve: the latest release / HEAD of comma-plugin should fix the issue with opening older comma projects

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Great -- I just made a pull.

[15:12] <ab5tract> awesome, please let me know how it goes once you have an opportunity to try it

[15:31] *** Sgeo joined
[16:32] *** dakkar left
[16:34] <ab5tract> there are some other exceptions that have surfaced now, but at least the opening of old projects *should* be good

[17:57] <ab5tract> apologies for the constant updates, but HEAD / beta 7 has a cleaner implementation of the old project solution

[18:09] <[Coke]> ab5tract++

[18:09] <[Coke]> where's the repo again?

[18:10] *** timo joined
[18:11] * [Coke] frinds https://github.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin

[18:12] <ab5tract> Now that the open projects issue is fixed, I think it‚Äôs ready to move into the org proper

[18:12] <ab5tract> Once I can confirm from a few others that it‚Äôs working without issue

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract  1. Deleted old comma-plugin repository 2. Got/clone the current comma-plugin repostory 3. Built and installed the plugin 4. Opened an existing largish Raku repository 4.1. Got nice/expected highlighting 5. IntelliJ hangs when I tried to run all tests 5.1. Had to use kill -9 to kill it 6. If I try to run single test file I get the message "No tests were found" 7. Otherwise, I can browse / navigate the

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> code, etc.

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm.... I forgot the to remove the ".idea" directory, though. I will try that soon...

[18:31] <ab5tract> that should already be handled for you transparently

[18:32] <ab5tract> thanks for testing :thumbs-up:

[18:33] <ab5tract> did you choose `Open` from  the `File` menu?

[18:33] <ab5tract> or the `Open` button from the IntelliJ welcome page?

[18:33] <ab5tract> and did you add a new configuration to run those tests?

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, it was previously "known" project in IntelliJ's project panel.

[18:34] <ab5tract> please try again with `Open`

[18:34] <ab5tract> I'll look into making that irrelevant, but it seems that the current open project processor gets bypassed that way

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, I didn't try to add a special configuration  -- I expect(ed) the shourcut Cmd-R to work.

[18:35] <ab5tract> existing configurations will all reference Java classes that don't exist anymore

[18:35] *** euandreh joined
[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I removed that project from the "Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA" and then opened with "Open". Looks fine.

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1286395983860858992/comma-plugin-tests.png?ex=66edc11e&is=66ec6f9e&hm=0969d6368f75d341e90c658abd941b7abfae7b04f26a51357c07b32be3c687b3&

[18:39] <ab5tract> huh, that `iml` file was supposed to get nuked

[18:40] <ab5tract> how about cmd + R?

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Both "Cmd-R" and "Ctrl-R" do not work. The latter gives the message.

[18:42] *** euandreh left
[18:43] *** euandreh joined
[18:43] <ab5tract> ok

[18:44] <ab5tract> Are there any configurations already defined in the top left?

[18:44] <ab5tract> it might also be that you need to do `Tools > Setup Raku SDK`

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, the SDK setup was requested when I opened the project as "new".

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No, not configurations are defined.

[18:48] <ab5tract> I'll look into how to create those by default

[18:49] <ab5tract> but for now I'm afraid you need to manually create the test configuration
