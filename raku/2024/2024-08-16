[11:21] <gfldex> tbrowder: The best way to stop users of your code in general is by good documentation. You can never stop them from using the MOP or decending into NQP-land to mess with your stuff.

[11:23] <gfldex> tbrowder: If I see `is implementation-detail` I know what not to do. :->

[11:37] <tbrowder> yes, i know, i'm just trying to avoid regular users causing trbl

[11:37] <tbrowder> accidentally

[11:44] *** wlhn left
[12:48] <tbrowder> hm, "is implementaion-detail" a real trait? have to check docs...yes, thnx, that looks a good thing which i obviously have never used!

[12:52] <tbrowder> i will use that trait if i can figure out exactly where to use it.

[12:52] <tbrowder> gfldex: thanks!

[12:53] <tbrowder> stiil fighting with my own code...

[12:56] <[Coke]> I think it was intended for compilers to say "don't assume this this official", but I guess it could be extended for user-written code, aye.

[13:18] <tbrowder> maybe use both...

[14:00] <[Coke]> "that this is"

[14:34] <jaguart> my raku is from nxadm:rakudo-pkg (thank you!) - when installing raku site modules, should I be 'sudo zef -I' or 'sudo zef-as-root' etc?

[14:34] <jaguart> or something completely different?

[14:40] <jaguart> and is raku and zef installation recommends (eg paths permissions etc) written up in a blog anywhere?

[15:14] <jaguart> oh - I've found this: https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/docs/zef.html - which implies that the norm is in the home folder of a user

[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jaguart: I use rakubrew.org - that has the benefit, like pyenv, of managing multiple versions - typically each version has it own zef install (that's a user account install too, afaict)

[15:35] *** xinming left

[15:46] <El_Che> jaguart: yes, that's how I understand zef/raku flow. But this could be indeed be clarified buy raku (steering)

[15:51] *** Xliff joined
[15:52] *** MoC joined
[16:16] <jaguart> yeah - it's hard to debug on the filesystem because the compunits are not identifiable by their filenames

[16:21] *** japhb_ left
[16:21] <jaguart> there is also some magic around groups I think - my user is a member of raku-zef - and I think this means I install to site by default

[16:22] <jaguart> at least if I ``zef install Readline`` I had permission problems on these folders until I chmod g+s on the site folder

[16:56] *** Sgeo joined
[16:57] <jaguart> or if you containerise everything etc, then your container build and update processes

[17:04] <jaguart> Did you all watch the Damian on perl multi methods and cleaning up smartmatch?

[17:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Perl, ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> You realize there would be no Raku if not for Perl, right?

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs Yes, long time ago. (And it is pretty obvious, anyway...)

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is interesting, is that the more I use Raku, the less I can tolerate Perl.

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I used to work with Perl a lot in the past. I'm really glad "Perl 6" found its way. I couldn't use Perl anymore. Raku fixed so many of its problems and introduced so many fantastic features.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> So, hypothetically, if I had access to a time machine and wanted to take raku back in time and "gift" it to the perl community just after the coffe-cup incident what all should be included and how do we give proper attribution to the developers?

[18:46] <[Coke]> (attribution) - we answered that question at the time for the Christmas (Koleda) release.

[19:22] <tbrowder> pls remind me of the coffee-cup incident

[19:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I asked LLM that, and it started applogizing for using a "generic phrase."

[19:30] <tbrowder> not surprised...

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> In fact I think the first image should be canonical.

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, I gave DALL-E the description you the mail message you linked to. But DALL-E tends to make its images too "crowded", so they look AI-generated.

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lol - i count them 14 round the table - very biblical

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> At first watch I was somewhere between confused (how can a person do all those air miles and not be ashamed) and betrayed (this guy is my hero - he practically made perl6/raku - and now he is busy bringing given / when to perl and undermining the raku project

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> some irate comments here ensued

[22:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> On second watch, I realised that Damian had been ambushed by some decision in the perl community to drop given/when from perl only a couple of versions after agreeing to include it - and this was Damianâ€™s way to keep the idea alive and to refine it with a more constrained set of smartmatch variants.

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> All in all a sad spectacle - my takeaway is that perl is even deader than i thought - hopefully some perl folks will give raku a second look since we have had these goodies all along - and Damian will work from home and apply the improvement to a coming  iteration of raku

[23:50] *** Xliff joined
[23:51] <Xliff> I'm trying to port some javascript to raku and I've encounteded a weird expression. " let isWindow = !!source.metaWindow;"

[23:51] <Xliff> What does the !! mean?

[23:51] <ab5tract> librasteve: at first watch of what, may I ask?

[23:53] <ab5tract> Xliff: at a glance my guess is that itâ€™s similar to how it works in Perl

[23:53] <Xliff> And how does it work in Perl?

[23:54] <ab5tract> By negating the negation you can avoid some issues around nullity

[23:54] <Xliff> Aw crap.

[23:54] <Xliff> OK.

[23:54] <ab5tract> the full form in Perl is 0+!!($thing)

[23:54] <Xliff> I didn't think it was going to be that easy.

[23:54] <Xliff> So.... .so.not

[23:55] <Xliff> Or just .so?

[23:55] <ab5tract> Itâ€™s called the key of truth in perlsecret

[23:56] <ab5tract> The same as .so / so / ?
