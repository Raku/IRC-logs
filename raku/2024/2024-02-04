[00:01] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> zef/fez question: I have a docker file template in a resources directory for my module. When I install it and try to run a provided executable it cannot find that template. Is there some magic that needs to be done to the META6.json file? link to META6.json: https://github.com/ssotka/Marrow/blob/master/META6.json

[06:39] <patrickb> I believe we should be bundling a TLS library with our binary releases. Reasoning: To install a TLS lib one needs a compiler. That's a step up the difficulty ladder. For source releases that doesn't matter. Users 'd need a compiler anyways. For Linux it isn't an issue either

[06:39] <patrickb> I don't know much about MacOS though.

[06:41] <patrickb> So for the Windows precompiled releases, I believe there should be a TLS in there. Maybe not even the Raku OpenSSL lib, but at least the C library itself.

[06:42] <patrickb> I do not think bundling with our source not to say have it in git should happen.

[06:53] <patrickb> Alternatively we could provide such compiled C libs for Download via zef (gtk::simple does that).
