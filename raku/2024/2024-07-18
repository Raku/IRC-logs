[12:17] <wayland76> Well, I made some progress in my Table-Oriented Programming module, specifically in implementing ## $table[0]<name> = 'Narnia' ## where the code between the double-hashes will automatically store a value in a Postgres database.  It doesn't work yet, but I'm making progress :) .

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Hmm, maybe .min/.max should intercept :by options and error?

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I just got bit by a conversion from sub form to Cool form and lost the behavior with no warning

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vendethiel  It is not clear to me what you mean. But R has the option na.rm  in most of its numerical functions. "Not Availalble" (NA) objects are essentially removed before the corresponding numeric computations.

[15:07] <dakkar> I suspect @vendethiel is referring to the difference between `multi sub max(+args, :&by, …)` and `multi method max(&by?, …)`

[15:08] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> dakkar: correct

[15:08] <dakkar> so if you replace `max(1,2,3, :by(something))` with `[1,2,3].max(:by(something))`, the `something` will be silently ignored

[15:08] <dakkar> it would be nice if the method form noticed the `:by` and either used it, or warned

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dakkar Good to know!

[16:50] <lizmat> that feels like a bug

[16:51] <lizmat> actually, with .max, the "by" is an optional positional

[16:53] <lizmat> m: say (3,20,100).max(*.Str)

[16:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2144863d8: OUTPUT: «3␤»

I just killed them and they should start up just fine now. In the future, you can try to make a commit in raku/whateverable repo, that triggerss a redeploy of all bots which achieves the same thing
