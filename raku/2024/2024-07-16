[09:09] <wayland> Anyone know how to print out the native type (int8)?  

[09:14] <wayland> lizmat: Great!  That's definitely going to save me from reimplementing it poorly :D

[09:15] <lizmat> wayland: more recently there's also .are(type) which will return a Bool indicating whether all types match the given type

[09:15] <wayland> Oh, nice!  

[09:16] <lizmat> re: my int8 $a, there's currently no way to find out other than to dive deep into nqp land

[09:16] <lizmat> int8 is not a HLL type itself, so it will upgrade all accesses to Int and that's what you're seeing

[09:17] <wayland> Oh, that's a pity.  I was going to use it to create eg. fields in Postgres that had the relevant types.  But if it's not easily implemented, then I'll stick to more general types for now, and implement that later.  

[09:20] <wayland> Hmm.  The search for this channel won't do dates after 2024-06-13.  

[09:21] *** jpn joined
[09:21] <wayland> Oh.  But then it ignores the date and searches to today anyway.  

[09:22] <wayland> Oh, my bad, I just needed to click refresh.  Soz.

[09:33] <wayland> Another question: Where do I go to read about the ::T syntax?  I had a skim through some of the doco, but didn't see anything that looked useful.  

[09:39] <lizmat> good question: I hoped to find something under generics...  but alas...

[09:39] <lizmat> please make a doc issue for this

[09:40] <lizmat> wayland: https://vrurg.github.io/2020/11/16/Report-On-New-Coercions

[09:41] <lizmat> and https://vrurg.github.io/2020/11/30/Report-On-New-Coercions-Part-2

[09:44] <wayland> lizmat: https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Type_captures maybe?  

[09:45] <lizmat> heh... yes

[09:45] <lizmat> internally they're called generics   ... been spending too much time on internals this year  :-)

[09:46] <wayland> m: my ::T = Str; say ::T;

[09:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed my␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my ::T⏏ = Str; say ::T;␤»

[09:47] <wayland> I'm essentially trying to store a type in a variable again.  

[09:47] <lizmat> m: sub a(::T $a) { dd $a }; a Str

[09:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «Str␤»

[09:48] <lizmat> but if it's just about storing a type:

[09:48] *** jpn left
[09:48] <lizmat> m: my $a = Str; say $a

[09:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[09:48] <wayland> Yes, I'm aware that it can be done via a signature, but I want to store it in an attribute of an object.  Essentially I have an object that represents a field in a DB.  But maybe I should just go with Parameter.new() and put that in the attribute.  

[09:49] <wayland> Oh, yeah, that's easier :).  

[09:50] <lizmat> if you want to make sure that only types can be stored, you could use the Any:U constraint

[09:50] <lizmat> m: 'my Any:U $a = Str; say $a

[09:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in single quotes; couldn't find final "'" (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 'my Any:U $a = Str; say $a⏏<EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤    …»

[09:51] <lizmat> m: my Any:U $a = Str; say $a

[09:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[09:51] <lizmat> m: my Any:U $a = "foo"; say $a

[09:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3766ef2d4: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to $a; expected Any:U but got Str ("foo")␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:56] <wayland> lizmat: Done!  https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4499

[09:57] <wayland> lizmat: Should I put in a bug requesting a way to identify native types, or is that covered somewhere already?  

[09:58] <lizmat> yeah, that feels like a good idea  :-)

[10:01] <wayland> lizmat: Does it go on https://github.com/rakudo/star ?

[20:05] <[Coke]> getting a "too many open files" in a raku/doc xt test after adding in calls via HTTP::Tiny. Any suggestions on how to track down what files are being kept open?

[20:06] <[Coke]> (I'm assuming it's really HTTP::Tiny items not getting closed)

[20:07] *** jpn joined
[20:17] <ugexe> It’s almost certainly socket handles and the way that module handles it 

[20:18] <ugexe> You can probably manually close the connections yourself instead of relying on the module to handle it automatically 

[20:27] <[Coke]> The handle in HTTP::Tiny is a private attribute, unfortunately.

[20:27] <[Coke]> will poke around.

[20:38] <[Coke]> Cro::HTTP::Client seems more robust, unsurprisingly.
