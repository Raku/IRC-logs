[00:13] <guifa> for those of y'all who have worked with Cro, how can you affect what's sent in an HTTP request's <head> ?

[00:13] <tellable6> 2024-10-27T09:01:14Z #raku <lizmat> guifa: I think so  :-)

[12:53] <xinming> sometimes, there is no raku to download in rakubrew, Is this normal?

[12:53] *** ky1 joined
[12:57] <lizmat> patrickb ^^

[12:59] <patrickb> Shouldn't be. Is it reproducible? I.e. on some computers there never is one?

[13:00] <patrickb> Not all architectures have pre built binaries.

[13:00] <xinming> patrickb: It's amd64, But for 2024.10 version

[13:00] <xinming> There is no D in front of the version

[13:00] <patrickb> ah

[13:01] <patrickb> Yeah, I'm not the fastest in creating the pre built binaries.

[13:01] <xinming> Is there a lcoal cache I need to clear, so it tries to fetch remote again?

[13:01] <patrickb> No. It's simply not there yet.

[13:02] <xinming> hmm, Ok, got it. Will wait, No hurry.

[13:02] <patrickb> I was moving cities this weekend and simply didn't get around to creating the binaries yet.

[13:02] <xinming> If the process can be made automatic, that'll be faster

[13:02] *** ky1 left
[13:03] <patrickb> It is mostly automated. But I do like to verify the results manually.

[13:03] *** ky1 joined
[13:04] <patrickb> But yeah, maybe that idea is outdated...

[13:05] <xinming> I think the verification is already done by official raku repo

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I read/watch the "HTML::Functional" blog post / demo movie. I assume that approach can be easily extended to using HTML widgets (or whatever they are called) for interactive interfaces. Do you think interactive interfaces can be done completely with(in) Raku using HTML and HTMX?

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tldr; yes

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> long version ... I have implemented all the base HTMX examples in Raku / Cro here https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples ... initially with crotmp to generate the HTML and this provides imo a nearly complete set of dynamic facilities for a "static website with dynamic interactions" ... you can see the ideas in action here https://htmx.org/examples, or you can follow the Getting Started to run them in Cro.

[16:48] *** Ekho left
[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ... I have started to use HTML::Functional ideas in the steve-02-fn branch of HTMX-Examples ... this is a bit of learning by doing - for example I have made a "hydrate" function that takes a function and populates it dynamically from a data object (same model as crotmp ... but the HTML comes from a function) ...

[16:53] *** ky1 left
[16:53] *** ky1 joined
[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> feel free to clone this style - I would encourage any curious rakuteers to fork the repo (make sure you get all the branches), pick one of the unimplemented HTMX examples and implement in the style of the Click-To-Edit.rakumod I have made to get a feel for how to use HTML::Functional to make web components (and of course PR ist back if you would like me to review it and include in the example library

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> great minds think alike

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> apologies that I didn't find / credit your module (is there a repo somewhere?) - I did find HTML::Lazy that has some overlap too

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> HTML::Lazy has the benefit of being lazy ... but I couldn't work out why you would want that in an HTML render pattern ... maybe I will eat my words

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have seen this kind of comment twice in Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mempko .

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure how to interpret that one, to be honest, especially the last sentence: > You would think someone would make a really great library to create AI Agents using Raku.

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But it seems to me that author did not bother looking up / googling "Raku LLM".

[22:02] <tonyo> librasteve: i made the Ryml at someone's request, i don't exactly recall the circumstance.  i didn't realize htmx was still around, i remember being excited for it a long time ago

[22:03] <El_Che> tonyo: a few people at work were excited by htmx. They were bitten too much by JS dependencies

[22:05] <El_Che> tonyo: ryml looks nice

[22:06] <tonyo> a lot more accessible to most than trying to learn an entire framework, or manage wordpress on their own (or, worse, manage a wordpress hosting provider)

[22:07] <tonyo> thanks, racking my brain trying to remember how that came to be.  might've been rf and humming-bird but not recalling

[22:08] <El_Che> I moved my personal stuff some time ago to html generators

[22:08] <tonyo> i miss jade templates. what do you use now?

[22:08] <El_Che> hugo

[22:09] <El_Che> converts markdown to html

[22:09] <El_Che> that's it

[22:09] <El_Che> the diffulty/pain is in the css if you want to change theme

[22:09] <tonyo> interesting, looks a little like something we use at work for email templates

[22:10] <tonyo> but it's bundled in python/flask
