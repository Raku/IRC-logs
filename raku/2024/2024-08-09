[17:24] <[Coke]> thanks, rubber ducks.

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I will collect a list of "cokisms."

[17:47] <[Coke]> that's from "rubber duck debugging"

[17:48] <[Coke]> (the part of my brain that tries to figure things out internally is not the same part as the one that has to explain it to other people)

[18:02] <tbrowder> anyone know default encoding on Raku on Windows? i suspect utf8 but‚Ä¶

[18:14] *** bdju left
[18:24] *** bdju joined
[18:38] <[Coke]> it's utf8 everywhere.

[18:38] <[Coke]> you might have to change your shell's codepage for it to work as expected.

[18:39] *** skyesoss1 joined
[18:40] <[Coke]> "chcp 65001" in console for that session. There's probably a way to make that the default for all instances of the cmd prompt or powershell, not sure.

[19:16] <tbrowder> thnx

[19:21] <tbrowder> in the win test output on github workflows i'm getting no text at all where mac and linux are good. i'm getting a warning that os mswin32 is not supported. it looks like it's probably coming from Zef::Service:üêö:Test

[19:22] <tbrowder> that icon is 'Shell', i didn't do that intentionally

[19:25] <tbrowder> so in an 'enc' option what do you suggest i enter? just the number or the string 'chcp 65001'?

[19:27] <tbrowder> the shell is executing "pdftotext" which has an -enc option

[19:49] <tadzik> lizmat: I missed a notification for some reason, but I'll sit down and do the work :)

[19:50] <lizmat> tadzik: thanks, and if you feel that a distro isn't worth saving: archive it

[19:51] <lizmat> the last version will remain available through the REA

[19:51] <tadzik> yeah, I can thing of a few ;)

[19:51] <lizmat> just remove the ones you archive from ecosystem/META.list

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I should get it done too‚Ä¶

[22:54] <wayland> Hi!  I've got a class that's descended from Hash::Agnostic.  The AT-KEY method in the class does some funky stuff, but I want the TWEAK method on the class to be able to call AT-KEY on the immediate ancestor, not the one on the current class.  How do I do that?  

[23:03] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> You can specify where to start the lookup if you know the class name

[23:04] <wayland> vendethiel: Great!  What do I look up to read about that?  

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> https://docs.raku.org/language/objects#Inheritance

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> End of that paragraph

[23:08] <wayland> Thanks!  

[23:13] <[Coke]> tbrowder: chcp 65001 is a command you run, not an encoding

[23:13] <[Coke]> if you need an encoding, I assume you'd want "utf8" or however you spell it (caps, dashes, etc.)

[23:40] <wayland> How do I get a reference to a method?  Like, the method has been defined, but I want a reference to it instead of calling it.  

[23:40] <[Coke]> https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez

[23:40] <Xliff> [Coke]++

[23:41] <Xliff> wayland: Class.^can('<method-name>').head

[23:42] <gfldex> wayland: You have to go through the MOP. There are quite a few methods to choose from. .^can or .^find_method might help. If it's a multi, things become interesting.

[23:42] <Xliff> wayland: That will give you the first method object associated with the method named <method-name>

[23:42] <[Coke]> m: my $a = Str.^lookup("words"); dd $a # one way

[23:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar e16400b18: OUTPUT: ¬´$a = proto method words (Cool $:: |) {*}‚ê§¬ª

[23:43] <wayland> Yeah, I've been looking at the multi-dispatch doco, but couldn't figure out how to get the method to call "candidates" on :) .
