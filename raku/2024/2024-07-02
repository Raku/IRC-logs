[00:24] <[Coke]> .seen Util

[00:24] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw Util 2024-04-16T20:36:58Z in #raku: <Util> Summary: (1) we want more Raku talks. (2) Rakudo internals qualifies for the Science track (paper or poster). Thanks!

[00:25] <[Coke]> ^^ there was an attempt to get more talks.

[00:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Right, I remember the call for papers. I strongly considered going, then I decided it is too far and not worth it.

[12:12] <tbrowder> ugexe: using the Build module, what is the correct way to have an installation script get the *contents* of file X in the /resources directory?

[12:15] *** jpn left
[12:22] <tbrowder> the docs say: $?DISTRIBUTION.content(‚Äúresources/X‚Äù);

[12:23] *** jpn joined
[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Can't you just you slurp over %*RESOURCES<X> ?

[15:24] <tbrowder> antononcube: it‚Äôs a subtle issue in my brain. during a Build and install action i just want to make sure the docs are correct. i‚Äôm assuming they are but i   like to have  ugexe to verify that.

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Good luck!

[15:31] <ugexe> you don't get access to $?DISTRIBUTION in Build. Build implies that it must occur before the distribution truly exists

[15:32] <ugexe> if the distribution hasn't been built, how could $?DISTRIBUTION exist in other words

[15:34] <ugexe> at build time i

[15:34] <ugexe> that being said, you could just do:

[15:34] <ugexe> class Buikd { method build($dist-path) { my $dist = Distribution::Path.new($dist.IO); say $dist.content("resources/foo.txt") } }

[15:34] <ugexe> rather: class Build { method build($dist-path) { my $dist = Distribution::Path.new($dist-path.IO); say $dist.content("resources/foo.txt") } }

[15:35] <ugexe> at build time though I'd probably just access the paths directory without using a distribution object

[15:35] <ugexe> i.e. class Build { method build($dist-path) { say $dist-path.IO.slurp } }

[15:36] <ugexe> either one should work for you

[15:37] <ugexe> i don't know why you'd have a Build.rakumod file to verify docs are correct though. that means it would be occuring on every users computer that installs that distribution, when in reality it should only ever need to be verified once by the author

[15:38] <ugexe> so maybe that verification would be better in a xt/foo.rakutest file that you as the author manually run

[16:36] <tbrowder> maybe not. the resources include a font file that may or may not already exist the first time the module is installed. it also installs a user font config file if it doesn‚Äôt exist. if it does exist, the user may have misconfigured it.

[16:37] <tbrowder> and it will be repaired.

[16:47] <ugexe> distributions should be immutable

[16:48] <ugexe> adding things to resources/ at build time is mutating it

[16:49] <ugexe> if you have some file to instal that may or may not exist, it should be installed outside the scope of raku. i.e. install to $HOME/.some-known-directory, and have your code reference that

[16:50] <tbrowder> that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm doing

[16:51] <ugexe> ah i parsed your sentence wrong then

[16:51] <tbrowder> not adding to resources, using them

[16:52] <ugexe> i think you have to be careful around assuming if it exists that it might be misconfigured

[16:52] <ugexe> for example, someone installs your module which runs that Build.rakumod and installs that file. Then they uninstall that distribution which does nothing to remove the file you installed with Build.rakumod. Then they later go to install it again

[16:53] <tbrowder> yes. i just check it for proper contents and structure and inform user

[16:53] <tbrowder> and fix it

[16:57] <tbrowder> the config file is a hash for quick lookups of local but required font files

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just coming on the chat - @ingy has made some counterpoints to mine - so, maybe I am out of line - what is the "show of hands" on this channel about the recent tprc (+) means good for raku, (-) means bad for raku, (++) / (--) weight for folks that attended...

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve  You are not "out of line." I, on the other hand, consider writing a blog post "Reasons not to use Raku." I have a few versions of it, BTW.

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have written similar for other languages -- WL, Python, R, Swift.

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Reasons not to use those, that is...)

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the basis of Murphys law, that would probably boost interest in raku

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, "Streisand law", I think.

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> we need to collect all the counter fashionistas

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, that would be good.

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I need to finish my R rant / blog. I was just explaining the main reason "why not R" to a computer scientist.

[18:13] *** beanbrain left
[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The thing is for R there is well know effort doing that kind criticism -- that cannot be criticized -- called  "The R Inferno."

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is high bar to reach...

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I think your ¬±raku / ¬±perl study has to be done via Google forms or similar.

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well - I see that you have not confined yourself to my +/- format

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, we can/should write a "Cro" app for that. (Or "HummingBird" one.)

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve üôÇ I am using your "around / interval" arithmetic post as guide.

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> as a guide to "why not raku"?

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> no, to use "¬±raku" and "¬±perl" -- I misunderstood.

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ...And I was referring to this post : https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2023/11/11/junctions-for-interval-arithmetic/

[18:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thank you and you're welcome!

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sure. The keyword Around is from WL, by the way. I strongly susptect it was introduced because of units-related workflows.

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interval  and co., on the other hand, have "always" been in Mathematica. (Most like post version 2.0.)

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my recent reading suggests that Interval arithmetic is a useful tool in rather an abstract way, but that its inability to represent Gaussian means that it is not a useful tool for physicists

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ie to represent physical measurements

[18:28] *** soverysour left
[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I wonder is Around  of Mathematica / WL trying to address that. See here: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Around.html

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah! thanks for the references
