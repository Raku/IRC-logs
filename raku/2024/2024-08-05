[07:46] <Xliff_> \o

[07:47] * Xliff_ just wrote a spectrum analyzer using his p6-GStreamer! :D

[07:49] <ab5tract> Nice! Do you have a screenshot?

[07:49] <Xliff_> https://imgur.com/cj5uci3.png

[07:51] <Xliff_> Source code here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GStreamer/blob/main/examples/spectrum-gui.e

[07:58] <Xliff_> As far as testing it yourself? I would recommend you have an Ubuntu install.

[07:59] <Xliff_> I'll be spending the rest of the week committing code across all of my projects because I've been working on this and other things the whole year. There is no guarantee that the repositories are fully updatewd.

[08:00] * Xliff_ was fixing bugs not 10 minutes ago...

[08:00] <ab5tract>  Looks great :)

[08:02] <ab5tract> I need to fix my Linux laptop.. I sort-of nuked it by cleaning all settings from a my home directory while planning to migrate the root partition to Guix

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff The README of ‚Äúp6-GStreamer‚Äù should say what is that project about.

[08:54] <Xliff_> antoncube: I am well aware, except.... I'm not quite sure how to answer that. What's in there is the most acurate way to describe.

[08:54] <Xliff_> "Raku port to Gnome's GStreamer library"

[08:55] <Xliff_> I am only now getting my mind around what GStreamer really is.

[08:55] *** sena_kun left
[08:55] <ab5tract> Would ‚Äúwrapper of‚Äù perhaps be more accurate?

[08:56] <Xliff_> Yeah. It would! ab5tract++. Is that not what is there? That README was written years ago.

[08:56] <ab5tract> Oh, I was responding to your quote, haven‚Äôt checked the README

[08:57] <Xliff_> And you actually handled both! :)

[08:57] <ab5tract> It also punts the ‚Äúwhat the heck is this thing?‚Äù question onto the wrapped project ;)

[08:59] <ab5tract> If you‚Äôve got the time, pushing the same git repo to raku-GStreamer might be an idea as well

[09:00] <ab5tract> But that‚Äôs a small detail indeed

[09:11] *** skyesoss left
[09:15] <Xliff_> When I get the time, I will. I keep forgetting.

[09:16] <Xliff_> There are a LOT of projects that need to do that. Might be better to do them at once.

[09:16] <Xliff_> And... you will take ".pm6" from my cold. dead. hands.

[09:16] <Xliff_> I was 8.3 born.

[09:17] <Xliff_> I gave up the 8 for lent. 

[09:17] <Xliff_> ".rakumod has yet to become a taste I have acquired!", said the curmudgeon

[09:24] <ab5tract> :)

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> LLMs can suggest brief summaries or mission statements for GitHub repositories. Just the current README might suffice .

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is the real name of MaterDuke17 ? (For references.)

[11:56] <lizmat> you can always look in the CREDITS file of a rakudo dist  :-)

[15:30] <Xliff> I know I've asked this before, but is there a way for you to pass a module name to Raku and get it's location on disk.

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Maybe the advice here still works. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66615906/finding-locally-compiled-raku-modules

[16:12] *** jgaz joined
[16:23] <Xliff> Yeah. I did. Fortunately my experiments were still in  my .history (I have over 4 years worth of commands!)

[16:23] <Xliff> To get the location of a Module by module name: dd $*REPO.repo-chain.first(*.?candidates("Duration::Units")).prefix

[16:52] <lizmat> PSA: I have disabled updates of the Raku Ecosystem Archive for modules still living in p6c

[20:00] <tbrowder> [Coke]: if you were referring to my ' perl5' dir thing, it's at https://github.com/tbrowder/FreeFont

[20:11] <[Coke]> not for your perl5 issue, but "We need to set this if our script uses any dependencies that" sounds suspicious.

[20:11] <[Coke]> Seems like you're either running an installed version or not

[20:15] <[Coke]> (installing all those deps so I can test your install issue)

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I will comment on your comment the proposed graph book title not to be "Retro Graph Algorithms with Raku" -- that "retro" should be dropped. üôÇ

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Too many graph theory/algorithms books -- to my knowledge -- have "modern graph theory" or similar in their title.

[21:20] <[Coke]> tbrowder: I can't install all your dependencies on my mac, so I won't be any help, sorry

[21:22] *** Altai-man left
[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, I am aware of two, the first one really important and famous -- "Modern Graph Theory" by B. Bollob√°s . But still the "retro" part is that the algorithms I consider to implement in "Graph" and describe in that book are fairly "old", standard, and established at this point.

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure what better characterizes Raku: "retro" or "postmodern." Maybe both.

[21:56] <tbrowder> thnx, that is also stopping me in my shiny new mac!

[21:57] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:59] <tbrowder> antononcube: i would vote but don't know enough about it. i'm not fond of the term 'retro'--too pop, not academic sounding...

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I guess I should recosider using "retro"...

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In Finland, if to a Finish guy two people tell him that he is drunk, even if he is sober, he goes home and takes a nap.

[22:12] <tbrowder> how bout a pedantic version of retro: something revisited, a second look, etc.

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, the graph algorithms I implement a fairly well known and not new. Revisited only. üôÇ

[22:15] *** Sgeo joined
[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> How about "Original Gangsta Graph Algorithms with Raku"?

[22:24] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> hmmm possibly too acedemic

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ üôÇ üíØ

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo Very good! I was going for the re-dubling in a name like "Retro Raku Graphs", but "Gangsta Graph Algorithms" is even better in that regard!

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For the record, I am also considering "Postmodern Development of Graph Algorithms for Raku" --  it did not occur to me to invert "Retro Graph blah blah" as "Gangsta Graph Algos" or similar.

[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> "a platonic dialog between Dre and Fitty discussing and explaining Graph theory"

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I am sure LLMs can produce "Rap for Graphs."

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Some Rap is thirty to 40 years old now. Does it qualify as classical music?

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is retro for sure.
