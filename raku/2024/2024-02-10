[20:40] <[Coke]_> I would expect e1️⃣ to be special if you're trying tdo maths, but take a string op?

[20:40] <lizmat> .ord takes the first codepoint

[20:41] <[Coke]_> oof

[20:41] *** [Coke] left
[20:41] <[Coke]_> what I really want is, given boxed 1, to get boxed 2.

[20:44] <lizmat> is what 1️⃣ is
