[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Have you done any performance bench-marking of "Hash::Sorted"?

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I considered using ""Hash::Sorted" in the sparse matrix package. Is possible to make that package to support sorting both by keys and by values?

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I did some benchmarking too -- I am not sure but I might have discovered a bug, trying to make a random sorted hash with 10_000 elements.

[16:23] <lizmat> Hmmm   looks like I forgot to document the :$cmp comparator...

[16:24] <lizmat> antononcube provide code that shows the problem, make an issue, and I'll look at it  :-)

[16:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I am making the reproducible script now.

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Submitted.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat The crash happens when I use random words generated with "Data::Generators". I strongly suspect it is something related to special symbols.

[23:23] <tellable6> librasteve, I saw masukomi 2022-11-03T20:09:54Z in #raku-dev: <masukomi> like it wasn't meaningful to me 

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> masukomi: please can you review the PR I did at the raku Definitely module?
