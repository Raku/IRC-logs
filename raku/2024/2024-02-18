[01:12] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I just rebuilt a small example of Cro + Red as example for Cro-HTTP-Session-Red (https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red). I hope it can help...

[21:26] <patrickb> I'm thinking about recreating IO::Socket::SSL in terms of IO::Socket::Async::SSL. The reason being stability.

[21:26] *** timo joined
[21:26] <patrickb> I'd do this in a separate project. I'm unsure how I'd name such a thing.

[21:27] <corwin> Could the Async (different part) go either at the end or beginning?

[21:28] <patrickb> Also, in general, should such a thing stay a separate project (and then need its own name) or could we just replace IO::Socket::SSL?

[21:28] <patrickb> corwin: Well the endresult wouldn't be async. That it uses IO::Socket::Async::SSL under the hood would be an implementation detail.

[21:29] <corwin> ok (it would have been quite safe to ignore me ;)

[21:33] <patrickb> I'm AFK for now, but I'll backlog and be interested in opinions. So please just type ahead! (ugexe: I'd be specifically interested in your opinion, as you've been attending to the OpenSSL and IO::Socket::SSL modules in the last few years.)

[21:36] <tbrowder__> anyone know if i can use distro path /sbin in a Build.rakumod file? or is only /bin to be used? that path will not be used after the Build module finishes it installation run.

[22:41] <ugexe> tbrowder__: you could invoke ./sbin/foo from a ./Build.rakumod file, although you'd want to be sure that the ./sbin directory gets put in your archive file i.e. mymodule.tar.gz

[22:49] *** wlhn joined
[22:57] <tbrowder__> ok, git add /sbin/my-build.raku; thnx

[23:06] <ugexe> patrickb: i'm not sure what a better name would be... IO::Socket::TLS maybe? i suppose replacing IO::Socket::SSL would also be acceptable imo assuming it actually is able to be a drop in replacement (both in interface and in how it iteracts with existing programs which may do things like spawn sockets inside threads or whatever)
