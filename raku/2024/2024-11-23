[02:21] <tbrowder> ref BEGIN i'm gonna quote what's in the docs. it's fairly clear, and i add the note about vars being used or defined having to be declared before the BEGIN

[02:25] <tbrowder> timo: good point about precompilation...moritz corrected an early misadventure of mine years ago regarding that. and i better check that now!

[03:53] <coleman> What is a good way to initialize a filepath variable if it exists, otherwise use a default value?

[03:53] <coleman> I have this:

[03:53] <coleman> my $css = do given "css/style.css" { when .IO.e { "other.css" } }

[03:53] <coleman> but I'm not thrilled about it

[03:59] <coleman> actually that logic is backwards

[04:01] <ugexe> my $file = <file1.txt file2.txt>.first(*.IO.e) // "file3.txt

[04:06] <coleman> gorgeous, thank you

[19:29] <lizmat> fwiw, I think you can do:

[19:29] <lizmat> my constant &infix:<¬∑> = &dot-product;

[19:30] <lizmat> *after* the dot-product definition

[19:30] <lizmat> removes one level of indirection

[20:12] <[Coke]> huh. at some point App::Uni started treating "-n dead" as Error encoding UTF-8 string: could not encode Unicode Surrogate codepoint 57005 (0xDEAD) instead of searching for the text 'dead' in the codepoint descriptions.

[20:13] <[Coke]> (maybe it always did because "dead" is also hex.)

[20:14] <[Coke]> ... 'abc' also dies complaining about 0xDABC. weird. will have to dig.

[20:15] <[Coke]> what's the process for deleting a package off cpan for raku?

[20:15] <[Coke]> (App::Uni is on zef these days)

[20:19] <lizmat> [Coke]: you go to PAUSE and mark the appropriate files for deletion

[20:20] <lizmat> and then a few days later, they'll get actually deleted

[20:20] <lizmat> fwiw, they will continue to exist in the REA, in case you wonder  :-)

[20:21] <[Coke]> If someone wants to use a crappy old version, that's their problem. :)

[20:21] <[Coke]> ugh, pause still doesn't have html login support. :)

[20:22] <lizmat> ?

[20:23] <lizmat> strange, my browser seems to remember?

[20:23] <lizmat> No files found in authors/id/E/EL/ELIZABETH   hehe

[20:24] <[Coke]> er, html form.

[20:24] <[Coke]> so I had to cut and paste from my password manager instead of just clicking.

[20:24] <lizmat> ah

[20:25] <[Coke]> the delete UI on pause - I selected everything, clicked delete, looked like a quick refresh... no indication it was done.

[20:26] <[Coke]> ah, you get an email. :)

[20:27] * [Coke] zzz

[20:30] <lizmat> they're marked for deletion, you can unmark them if you did an oopsie

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> lizmat - re "Please also send an easy and fast way to contact you to liz at raku.rocks", I assume that's an email address?

[21:25] <lizmat> yes

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> awesome, will do

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Also, could an admin set me up with a Raku Wordpress account as described in CONTRIBUTING.md? I have to be away from hoe for a while so I want to make sure everything is good to go

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> home*

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I'm "landyacht" on github if that matters

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I volunteer for admin duty on https://wordpress.com/view/raku-advent.blog if an opening appears

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> since I love WordPress‚Ñ¢ so much

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> oof, the conversion tool does not like references [^1] or monospace nested inside a link
