[02:14] <guifa> I kinda feel like subst should take a range, although I think other languages use splice for that

[02:14] <guifa> i just tried to do it and spent a while trying to figure out why it didn't work lol

[04:39] <elcaro> guifa: There's always `Pythonic::Str`... the only problem being that under the hood it essentially does a `.comb[Range].join`

[04:39] <guifa> elcaro: ew, no, no python for me

[04:39] <guifa> I have to deal with that enough at school hahaha

[04:39] <elcaro> It should be possible to add a case for when a Range is provided, and convert it to `substr` call

[04:39] <elcaro> oh, ok :D

[04:40] <elcaro> make your own method... I have the perfect name! `strange`

[04:57] <guifa> haha

[04:57] <guifa> but it is, I think, a decent use case

[04:57] <guifa> I'm working on a thing that creates multiple choice questions, and LLMs are HORRIBLE at that

[04:58] <guifa> I did find a way around it though

[04:58] <guifa> I already had a lemmatizer that could detect various forms of a word when I'd ask for an example sentence.

[04:58] <guifa> (so the front end could bold it)

[04:59] <guifa> Did the same thing and once I had the range of the word, I wanted to replace with a blank, and then ask the LLM to give me wrong answers :) 

[05:02] <guifa> So I'm doing $string.substr(0,$range.min) ~ '____' ~ $string.substr($range.max)

[05:02] <guifa> I guess I could also do $string.subst($string.substr($word-range), '___')

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Range can be easily specified with a regex for subst.

[06:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And I agree — using Python for inspiration or functionality support in Raku seems counterintuitive and backwards. (To me.)

[06:47] <SmokeMachine> m: my $a = “bla bla bla”; $a.substr-rw(4..7) = “_____”; say $a # guifa

[06:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 461b81f79: OUTPUT: «bla _____bla␤»

[06:48] <SmokeMachine> m: my $a = “bla bla bla”; $a.substr-rw(4..6) = “_____”; say $a

[06:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 461b81f79: OUTPUT: «bla _____ bla␤»

[06:51] <SmokeMachine> m: my $a = “bla bla bla”; (my $b = $a).substr-rw(4..7) = “_____”; say $a; say $b

[06:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 461b81f79: OUTPUT: «bla bla bla␤bla _____bla␤»

[06:58] <guifa> ah yeah but that modifies $a

[06:58] <guifa> also ab5tract++ for ^Inf for the Comma plugin 

[06:58] <guifa> just got it up and running in CLion 

[06:59] <guifa> Currently in a multi language project with Raku included and it's so much nicer

[07:26] <SmokeMachine> guifa: that’s why I also did the (my $b = $a).substr-rw

[08:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Yeah, same here — it is nice to combine Raku and C in CLion.

[16:35] <xinming> hmm, sorry, power is cut here, The last reply I got is from ab5tract 'I hope that makes sense and/or helps :)', If anyone replied after, Please re-send the reply. thanks.

[16:35] <xinming> ab5tract: Actually, I had an idea, which is I don't use the get method at all, Just set/get-if-present myself.

[16:36] <xinming> But something needs clarified from lizmat, with the get-if-present, Will it always return stale answers?

[16:38] <lizmat> xinming: perhaps you can find the answer here: https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/live.html 

[16:39] <xinming> Thanks. Will backlog

[16:39] <lizmat> is this about https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/2024-11-28.html#20:31 ?

[16:41] <xinming> Ys

[16:41] <xinming> yes

[16:41] <lizmat> i'd have to look

[16:42] <lizmat> I'm open to PRs  :-)
