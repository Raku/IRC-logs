[13:30] <ceux> i am playing around with Cro, and I have a route that i want to... greedy match, that is anything under /static/ (for the js, images, etc)

[13:31] <ceux> right now I just have  get -> 'static', $path

[13:31] <ceux> but my route isn't matching (getting a 404).

[13:34] <ceux> nvm, rtfm, just need it to slurp it all up with *@path

[13:41] *** sjn joined
[13:57] <ceux> facepalm, there's already a static  builtin for this

[17:41] <[Coke]> I have added a short script "wip" to my bin/ that does 'git commit -a -mwip' ... I am going to abuse this for sure.

[17:48] <jdv> i used to have a push hook (or something to that effect) that would fail pushing commits that had /wip/i in them cause i used to wip a lot

[17:50] <[Coke]> that's fair. I'm basically using it for doing wiki updates via git where the online message just would have been "updating <page name>"

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I changed / uploaded a few packages of mine with resources access you gave in a PR for "Chemistry::Stoichiometry". Thanks again!

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve "Chemistry::Stoichiometry" should install without making much noise now.

[18:26] <[Coke]> You're very welcome.
