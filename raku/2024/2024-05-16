[12:28] <ab5tract> tbrowder: thanks! the details from Whateverable are useful but it really requires both Perl and Raku timings to be able to make a proper comparison with the historical results

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I am sort of “tired” updating my DigitalOcean droplet (running a Cro service.) So, I started considering a week or so ago using a Docker image. DigitalOcean make fair amount of noise about their Docker integration. It is not clear to me how good it is or is it worth the effort.

[12:43] <jdv> probably worh^Hth it ^H

[12:44] <jdv> if you aren't "fluent" in docker it might be more annoying at first, like anything else really

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, any Docker project I have been asked to make so far took 5-10 times longer than expected.

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I tried the AWS LightSail service for some online Jupyter demos a while back - which I guess is similar to DigitalOcean + Docker ... https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2022/08/14/trc-slides/ and the lightsail video https://share.vidyard.com/watch/exK8EPkk6wV5AF2wbgCS5Q?

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I abandoned this due to the weakness of the free of charge / cheapest lightsail container not being fast enough for development and so on ... so now I use AWS EC2 and can adjust the server size "dynamically" (ie I can load the same image onto a small or medium according to how impatient/rich I am)

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> two things I can suggest would be helpful:- (i) https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/CLI::AWS::EC2-Simple (this makes a vanilla ubuntu server and optionally runs a setup to install raku + Docker + Docker-Compose on that box ... there is a config yaml where you specify the EC2 instance type you want, the image you want to load and so on) and (ii) I keep a chain of live raku oriented Dockerfiles here

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Dockerfiles that are working today ... this one docker run -it librasteve/rakudo:scipy should work out of the both (x86 only - a limitation of Jupyter Scipy model)

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> /both/box/

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I'm happy to support this and would welcome adding Cro to the mix (or Hummingbird...)

[13:04] <tbrowder> antononcube: what would you like to see changed in App::Mi6? What does it do that you don’t like?

[13:16] <[Coke]> if you're not logged into github, where do you get the git url for a repo? (thought it was clicking on the "<>Code \/" button but that does nothing.

[13:21] <jast> if the button does nothing, maybe the page wasn't loaded correctly? if I click that, I get a popup that gives me the HTTPS URL and a "copy" button

[13:22] <[Coke]> are you logged in to github?

[13:22] <jast> I tested in private mode, so no

[13:23] <jast> anyway you can always just use the web URL, e.g. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo

[13:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder I have used "App::Mi6" once for diagnostic purposes -- that was good / useful. The second time I tried to use it I forgot its assumptions or workflow. It got a bunch files changed and complained about not having PAUSE credentials setup.

[13:24] <lizmat> that feels like a log time ago: zef is default in App::Mi6 for a long time nonw

[13:24] <lizmat> *now

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder So, I guess the first things to propose are: 1) yes/no/cancel dialog when changing files, 2) including to Zef ecosystem and making a default.

[13:26] *** guifa joined
[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Hmm.. ok. I will have to verify that.

[13:28] <[Coke]> Might have picked some settings the first time you touched it and saved them in the dist.ini that you wouldn't get now if you started fresh

[13:29] *** jpn left
[13:29] <[Coke]> I was very happy to start using it and all my (admittedly tiny) packages use it now

[13:29] <lizmat> fwiw, all mu 200+ distributions also use App::Mi6  :-)

[13:32] *** jpn joined
[13:32] <[Coke]> "duly"

[13:32] <lizmat> well, App::Mi6 *is* pretty dull to me

[13:32] <[Coke]> HA

[13:32] <lizmat> it does what it's supposed to do!

[13:32] <lizmat> without much excitement :-)

[13:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Ok, also "duly"...

[13:35] <tbrowder> antononcube: a couple of things: (1) skaji, the author is slow to respond, i would love to have it as a community module, but he does like doc  improvement suggestions.

[13:37] <tbrowder> i devloped Mi6::Helper to help me ease creation of new modules to be managed by mi6.

[13:37] <lizmat> tbrowder: OOC, what is wrong with "mi6 new Foo" ?

[13:37] <lizmat> s/or missing from/

[13:38] <tbrowder> i am currently working on a lint mode point out problems or suggestions with a module repo directory

[13:39] <tbrowder> lizmat: i don't know.

[13:40] <lizmat> I was triggered by "to help me ease creation of new modules"

[13:41] <lizmat> it was my understanding that Mi6::Helper was intended to help migration of existing distributions to App::Mi6 ?

[13:42] <tbrowder> yes, but i haven't gotten to the "old=" mode yet. the "lint"  mode is a step in that direction

[13:43] <tbrowder> it was a bear trying to kill all the bugs with the "new" mod

[13:45] <tbrowder> *mode

[13:49] <tbrowder> it will do at least two things to help non-mi6-type distros: (1) check for missing dependencies not  in the META6.json file and (2) check for files in "resources" properly referenced in the meta file

[13:49] <tbrowder> i

[13:52] <tbrowder> i know one thing y'all don't like about mi6-helper is separating pod from code files and putting it in a separate rakudoc file. i can make thatN

[13:53] <lizmat> many of my modules have a separate .rakudoc file: it just requires a tweak in the dist.ini

[13:53] <tbrowder> that an option, but i like ir because it is easier for me to provide a better text flow. yr mileage may differ.

[13:58] <tbrowder> while on this subject, what do you think about a "best practices" started somewhere? early on i asked Damian  cause i loved his Perl book and he said it was too early. but what about now?

[14:00] <lizmat> I think now would be a good time, but fwiw I'd rather see https://course.raku.org finished  :-)

[14:00] <tbrowder> yes

[14:01] <tbrowder> is there an easy way to get that in pdf?

[14:02] <lizmat> not that I know  :-(

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Using pandoc, but LaTeX hast to be installed, and that might not be easy.

[14:08] <ab5tract> ConTeXt is easier/more minimal than LaTeX to install 

[14:08] <ab5tract> and way, way easier to customize

[14:08] <ab5tract> and its also a pandoc output

[14:16] <ab5tract> https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Using "✍️" instead of "duly/dully noted"...)

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I was wondering is installing "pdflatex" of similar sufficient.

[14:28] *** guifa left
[14:28] <tbrowder> a5tract: 2.00s on my Debian x64

[14:30] <tbrowder> raku v2024.02

[14:35] <tbrowder> using lizmat's version

[14:38] <tbrowder> and the perl version showed: 0.49s

[14:39] <tbrowder> v5.32.1

[14:40] <tbrowder> non-precompiled.

[14:40] <jdv> what versions of the code are you using?

[14:50] <tbrowder> for the sieve?

[14:51] <tbrowder> i used the last version in ab5tract's link to the issue

[14:52] <tbrowder> raku 2024.02, perl 5.32.1

[14:54] <jdv> oh, ok 

[15:04] <lizmat> actually, my version has one flaw

[15:05] <lizmat> with sub sieve(int $n) instead of sub sieve($n)

[15:05] <lizmat> and: my $start = nano; and my $end = nano; and printf "%.2fs\n", ($end - $start) / 1000000000;

[15:06] <lizmat> I get .80 second for Raku and 0.87 for Perl

[15:06] <lizmat> so it's at least on par with Perl

[15:07] <lizmat> with 5.28.0 on Intel

[15:11] <lizmat> On a M1, I get 1.24s (Raku) vs 0.64s (Perl 5.30.3)

[15:14] <ab5tract> tbrowder: I was interested in the non-optimized original verion, actually

[15:15] <tbrowder> oh, i'll try that, and lizmat's fix, too

[15:15] <ugexe> a 6 year old perl isnt exactly fair, although probably doesnt matter much

[15:15] <ab5tract> but it's definitely awesome that lizmat++'s optimized version can catch up with JIT involved

[15:16] <lizmat> and that's without using nqp

[15:19] <tbrowder> i'll checkout a more recent perl (but slower host)

[15:19] <ab5tract> thanks for looking into it tbrowder. don't forget to put some timings into the ticket too :)

[15:24] *** david_ joined
[15:54] <tbrowder> will do

[15:57] <tbrowder> fyi, no surprise but machine makes larger diff for me perl-wise. my latest perl (on latest debian) is an older server on dedispec.com; not worth posting in issue

[16:02] <tbrowder> with lizmat's latest i'm getting variable times, lowest so far is 0.44s

[16:03] <tbrowder> on my "new" debian

[16:05] <tbrowder> averaging around 0.85s

[16:17] *** Guest23 joined
[16:21] <lizmat> yeah, so I guess we can say that Perl is upto 2x as fast as Raku

[16:23] <lizmat> if you deduct startup times (0.11 for Raku, and 0.02 for perl on my M1), we're looking at .94 vs .64

[16:27] <Guest23> Given a 2d array A, and a list P: row,column, I can reference the cell at row, column with something like A[P.head;P.tail] or A[P.head][P.tail]. Is there a more concise way to do this? I've tried using hypers with [] ... something like A >>[]>> P ... without success.

[16:28] <[Coke]> I am not aware of a different syntax there (and those are pretty concise, no?)

[16:31] <ab5tract> Guest23: you can always wire up a custom operator as well

[16:32] <Guest23> No complaints; of course it's fine as is. It's just handy to directly apply a list to a 1d array, I thought there might be something similar for 2d (or higher).

[16:33] <lizmat> this is actually new syntax in 6.e

[16:36] <Guest23> woohoo!

[16:37] <lizmat> I vaguely remembered implementing something like that quite a while ago  :-)

[16:38] <Guest23> Does it also extent to dimensions >2? That would be cool.

[16:38] <lizmat> It extends to any number of dimensions as far as I remember

[17:34] <[Coke]> anyone have a pointer to a writeup on *why* the REPL can't run all code? I know there's a cheat with the context each line is run in, but don't recall the exacts.

[17:38] <ab5tract> Guest92: It's already available in recent (last year or so?) builds. `use v6.*` or `use v6.e.PREVIEW` will make it available

[17:38] <[Coke]> (as lizmat did when invoking camelia above)

[17:39] <lizmat> [Coke]: grammar changes don't carry over

[17:39] <lizmat> and some natives I believe
