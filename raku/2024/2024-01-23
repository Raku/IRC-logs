[00:11] <jdv> there's a information_schema standard?  i think its just .schema in sqlite.

[00:15] <guifa> Raku was designed for winning golf by tokens

[00:15] <guifa> (I think I remember more or less what timtoady said in that respect)

[00:41] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> @jdv - From the postgresql docs: The information schema consists of a set of views that contain information about the objects defined in the current database. The information schema is defined in the SQL standard and can therefore be expected to be portable and remain stable

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> SqLite has something similar, but not exactly the same. That said I don't think it will take much to add support for it.

[00:43] <jdv> i didn't know mysql and pg shared a schema thing.  wonder how long that's been.

[00:44] <tonyo>  they've had information schemas for a while

[00:44] *** Voldenet joined
[00:45] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> at least v 5.7

[00:45] <tonyo> mysql 5.0 

[00:45] <tonyo> pq 7.4

[00:49] <jdv> i think the most i used mysql was back in the v4 days.  huh.

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  TimToady    one should do token golf, not keystroke golf    18:36     'course then you have to figure out how to count tokens         :16<cafebeef> is one token, probably , but how many is :16($string) ?    18:37     and is foo() fewer tokens than foo.() ?         TimToady    one could do keystrokes without counting whitespace, I suppose    18:39     whitspace would correspond to a "free drop" in golf :)        

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> when your ball token is too close to the grandstands token    18:40     or maybe it's more like lift-clean-and-place rules :)    18:41     would be a nice cultural hack to start the Clean Golf meme    18:42     ignore whitespace, allow Unicode chars as single strokes

[11:09] <cog> One can export a multi method exported from a module  which is mixed into the actions. Can I do the same for tokens to create a new kind of term.

[11:09] <cog> multi trait_mod:<is>( ... ) is export # exported multimethod

[11:11] <cog> oops, the trait_mod does not belong to the actions

[11:16] <cog>   So if I define the appropriate role, can I expect the following  to work ?

[11:16] <cog>   Perl6::Grammar.^mixin(AGrammarRole);

[11:16] <cog>   Perl6::Actions.^mixin(AnActionsRole);

[11:16] <cog>   newFunkyStuffAddedToTheGrammarNoWRecognized

[11:20] <cog> maybe this is the answer : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60975309/how-to-reuse-a-language-token-in-a-custom-grammar-raku

[11:38] <cog> no luck, says dynamic variable $*LANG noit found

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am not sure about MOP stuff like .^mixin, but I do know that you can go grammar G does MyRole {} and re-use your MyRole tokens... how that helps

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> /how/hope/

[11:49] <cog> that's the rakudo grammar I want to expand

[11:52] <guifa> cog if you're trying to modify Raku's grammar itself you'll want to look at some of the slangs for how to do it

[11:53] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/PolyglotBrainfuck/blob/main/lib/Polyglot/Brainfuck.rakumod

[11:54] <cog> I guess I have found a model https://github.com/lizmat/Slang-Subscripts

[11:54] <guifa> $*LANG.define_slang('MAIN', $*LANG.slang_grammar('MAIN').^mixin(YourMixinGrammar), $*LANG.slang_actions('MAIN').^mixin(YourMixinActions))

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Geany with Raku would be cool. Maybe Perl's plugin for Geany is not that hard to convert into a Raku one. One thing that is needed is all Raku keywords.

[16:18] <[Coke]> "keyword" is not 100% as far as the grammar goes, but the L10N listing is probably a great start.

[17:30] <tbrowder__>  hi, i have much improved module Date::Names for several languages not having the full official abbreviation arrays. and i am also looking to add new languages if we have some new rakuuns whose native language is not one of the current 13 languages. see the CONTRIBUTING doc at the github site: https://github.com/tbrowder/Date-Names..

[17:31] <tbrowder__> i am closing in on making my module Calendar produce pdf versions in all the languages in Date::Names

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i quote Raku is an extremely weird language but I’ll keep it as straightforward as I can. haha
