[03:49] <guifa> what's the best way to package an executable (not native call) with a module to run with Proc::Async?

[03:50] <guifa> IIRC, using resources/ isn't optimal because %?RESOURCES<executable>.absolute isn't guaranteed to point to the location of the file

[11:28] <tbrowder> guifa: my naive answer is put it in bin/

[12:55] <tbrowder> Raku Christmas Advent is rapidly approaching....

[12:57] <tbrowder> :chr

[12:57] <tbrowder> üéÑ

[12:59] <tbrowder> üéÑ üéÑ üéÑ üéÑ

[13:03] <lizmat> tbrowder: I think we need to approach possible writers (the usual suspects) directly

[13:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am trying to decide which of three posts to submit as a Raku Advent post.

[13:06] <tbrowder> maybe all 3?

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Haha, sure.

[13:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (1) Chess positions plots and corresponding LLM personas, (2) Overview of graph algorithms and plotting, (3) Raku for Data Science and LLMs.

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The last one is 80% written, It started a request from Steve Roe for the London workshop.

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The Chess one ‚Äî I made it last year actually, but I never completely finished it.

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract With the new IntelliJ I get the following error: > Plugin 'Comma for Raku' (version '2.0') is not compatible with the current version of the IDE, because it requires build 242.* or older but the current build is IU-243.21565.193

[14:18] *** Sgeo joined
[14:22] <ab5tract> Strange, it‚Äôs supposed to be set as a minimum version. Thanks for reporting, I will look into it

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good luck!

[15:53] <[Coke]> (everytime that mac mini loses power, the external drive that has my home dir mounts in the wrong place, goes to /fooN instead of /foo)

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I plan to make a Raku package that parses/interprets R code using the R library "tidyverse". How should name that package? 1) R::Tidyverse::Grammar 2) DSL::R::Tidyverse

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> > The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

[16:29] *** yewscion joined
[17:15] *** yewscion left
[17:27] <ab5tract> Grammar::R::Tidyverse?

[17:28] <ab5tract> Also, very cool idea!

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is a very often "required feature" during/after my data wrangling DSL translations talks -- translating from Python or R data wrangling code (to whatever else.) Mostly about Python, though...

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My have a family of "DSL::*" packages, so I will most likely go with "DSL::R::Tidyverse".

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Do you do data wranling on regular basis? (Say with R.)

[17:42] <ab5tract> Nope. When I need to wrangle data I usually use Raku, but it‚Äôs not a daily thing

[17:44] <ab5tract> DSL is obviously fine as it is your choice but I associate it differently

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Aha! So, I should make "DSL::Raku::Reshaper" first.

[17:44] <ab5tract> I wouldn‚Äôt call R or Python a DSL, but maybe this tidyverse totally is

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I consider R "tidyverse" and Python "pandas" to be DSLs in this case.

[17:47] <ab5tract> My take is that I wouldn‚Äôt name a module that can handle Puppet recipes DSL::Ruby::Puppet

[17:47] <ab5tract> I‚Äôd just say DSL::Puppet

[17:48] <ab5tract> But that‚Äôs me :)

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see. Hmm, I might be too verbose on those package names. But it is easy to loose track, I think.

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This diagram shows the languages and packages addressed:

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/main/Diagrams/DSLs-Interpreter-for-Data-Wrangling-August-2022-state.png

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Someone who is new to data science / data wrangling might get lost in the all different names and flovors.

[17:50] <ab5tract> Ah, that‚Äôs a significant web there

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üëç

[17:51] <ab5tract> Still, I just personally don‚Äôt see R::Base being a DSL

[17:52] <ab5tract> Might as well just hop one layer up and use R::* if you are going to implement a significant portion of the language

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right. That works only as actions class name

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. That can be specialized "DSL::R::DataQueryWorkflows::Tidyverse".

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That actually, is the more consistent naming given my previously made / named DSL packages.

[18:00] <ab5tract> Consistency++

[18:01] <ab5tract> Though it‚Äôs quite a mouthful :)

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, those names are long.

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But there is an umbrella package "DSL::Translators" that rules them all!

[18:07] <ab5tract> you can load a module from another module such that your distribution ships a `Tidyverse` so that users could just `use Tidyverse`

[18:07] <ab5tract> via `needs`

[18:07] <ab5tract> anyway, just throwing that out there as an option

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ha! And Google knows it:

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1306682101067681833/Google-AI-knows-DSL-Translators.png?ex=67378e09&is=67363c89&hm=aeb65c01021003d7898ced4a6becc886c78820d5ea741e70a7e884cc0b5dc0be&

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, ok.  Ideally, "use DSL::Translators" should be sufficiently short, but shortcuts like "Tidyverse" or "Pandas" would be nice.

[18:29] *** hellwolf left
[18:33] <ab5tract> you could have `use DSL::Translators` make the short-names available or even immediately bring them into scope

[18:33] <ab5tract> antononcube: https://github.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin/issues/18#issuecomment-2477141418

[18:34] <ab5tract> tl;dr -- in a rush, pushed a potential fix, please check if you can otherwise I will verify later myself

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> coming to this a bit late, but I think you (anton) should find a good root name (Dan, Red, Cro eg) and then do your own subdirs off that - my inspiration is Cro (and jnthn knows waht he is doing) with many distributions and packages under the Cro::X::Y ... all the way down to class Cro::WebApp::Template::Compiled 

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (ie a class call Compiled in a dir tree in a module called Cro::WebApp

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> )

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Yeah, I think I came to the same conclusion.

[21:50] <ab5tract> None of which precludes offering short name alternatives , but I digress :)

[22:39] <teatwo> does the underlining mean soimething

[22:39] <teatwo> I thought maybe it meant ascii but I'm far away from my screen and can't see

[22:54] <timo> the underlining on the hex bytes is for printable ascii range
