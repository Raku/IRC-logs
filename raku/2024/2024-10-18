[18:02] <rakufan1> [0] > my $data := Map.new('key_1', Map.new('subkey_1','subval_1','subkey_2','subval_2'));

[18:02] <rakufan1> [1] > $data.keys

[18:02] <rakufan1> (subkey_1 key_1)

[18:03] <rakufan1> I find this very surprising. Is this really the correct behavior? Shouldn't 'key_1' be the only key in the $data?

[18:06] <rakufan1> And why is 'subkey_1' a key but not 'subkey_2'?

[18:16] <lizmat> rakufan1: that looks like a bug

[18:17] <lizmat> would you mind creating an issue for that?
