[17:22] <tonyo> xliff: i thought about doing something like that. that was the next step in SQL::Slang - essentially something like ABAP where SQL is a first class citizen in the code and raw SQL becomes actionable with a dialect.  so your SELECT * FROM xyz could also potentially run against csv files or whatever else

[17:22] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[20:32] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/07/08/2024-28-100-year-llm/

[20:55] <patrickb> lizmat: Re Weekly:Terminal-MakeRaw is a new module, not an updated one. Maybe an issue in the grabber script?

[20:56] <patrickb> lizmat: It's a nice one, btw. Thanks,

[21:49] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/scripts/blob/master/uni - this seems like overkill, but I have a few Raku-based tools that don't survive a rakubrew update, so I ended up making wrappers
