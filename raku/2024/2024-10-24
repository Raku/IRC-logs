[01:31] <SmokeMachine> there, I'm saving the op (a group that groups all operators: infix, prefix, postfix, etc) node, child of apply-op (that groups the apply of all operators) where the `.right` node is 1 using the name `op` and getting it after the query.

[07:29] <ab5tract> Yeah, the one thing that makes me nervous about creating categories like 'op' over the AST classes is that it's maybe not a 100% mapping, either conceptually or in the RakuAST type hierarchy

[07:30] <ab5tract> also, not sure how to parse ' ... op$op|).<op>' ... but I also haven't had coffee yet

[08:54] <Manifest0> Hi! Yesterday i got a core dump are you guys interested in it?

[09:00] <lizmat> is NativeCall involved ?

[09:02] <Manifest0> probably. I'm not using directly, but maybe libxml or dbiish might use it

[09:06] <Manifest0> i just checked and both libxml and dbiish use nativecall. So most probably nativecall is involved

[09:52] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: on the categries, we can have it defined class by class... avoiding parents if needed...

[09:53] *** ky1 joined
[09:53] <ab5tract> maybe one way to go would be to have pluggable categories

[09:54] <lizmat> Manifest0: sorry, I think that tells us something went wrong in garbage collecting

[09:54] <ab5tract> so you can create a specific set (or maybe even chain) of types to match

[09:55] <lizmat> and not a lot more: if you have a reproducable case, then it would be interesting

[09:55] <SmokeMachine> about the ' ... op$op|).<op>', ast-query now returns a ASTQuery::Match (that is Positional and Associative) and when you define a `$name` the match will be assigned to $match<name>... (kinda like $/)

[09:55] <ab5tract> ah, got it

[09:56] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: yes, I plan to allow the user to customise the categories...

[09:56] <ab5tract> `.op$op` still feels a bit squished to me

[09:56] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: awesome!

[09:56] <Manifest0> lizmat, it was the first time i got this error. I'm not able to reproduce it :-(

[09:56] <ab5tract> Manifest0: :(

[09:59] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: still about the categories, you can, instead of using `.group`, use just the class name like: `RakuAST::Call`, or `RakuAST::Call#say`

[10:00] <SmokeMachine> or `RakuAST::Call#say$call-say`

[10:19] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: just to point out that the positional part of the ASTQuery::Match will store a list of the complete matches: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hCd403ZM/image.png

[12:09] <Xliff> \o

[12:10] <Xliff> I am getting some weird behavior. I am populating a hash at INIT time, but it appears to be serialized after that. If I make changes to the hash file, those changes aren't reflected unless the module is itself recompiled.

[12:10] <Xliff> Is this a bug?

[12:10] <Xliff> Note all changes to the hash are made at INIT, not BEGIN

[12:12] *** ky1 left
[12:13] <timo> you can try outputting the hash's WHICH to verify you're looking at the same object at different times (though WHICH does not stick around across serialization)

[12:13] *** ky1 joined
[12:13] <Xliff> timo: Is the INIT closure built at compile time?

[12:14] <timo> that's possible, but it should be closing over the lexical, rather than the literal object, right?

[12:15] <Xliff> Yes, but the object is global.

[12:15] <timo> is this from bug hunting that report from today or yesterday or so, or something for your own projects?

[12:16] <timo> if loading the module causes the mainline to be run, I would assume a "my %foo" would be fresh each run, but an "our %foo" probably wouldn't be

[12:17] <Xliff> Yeah. It's our

[12:18] <Xliff> And no, this is from my mass of growing code.

[12:18] <timo> unfortunately, i'm not too familiar with the bits involved here

[12:19] <Xliff> ROFLMAOACK

[12:19] <Xliff> Actually, that's KTC not CK

[12:19] <Xliff> I added $hash = DateTime.now to the population routine and now it works.

[12:20] <timo> what's AKTC expand to?

[12:20] <Xliff> ðŸ¤£

[12:20] <Xliff> "And Killing the Cat"

[12:20] <Xliff> Which is mean. I lub mah kittehs!

[12:21] <timo> yeah i much prefer none(&KTC)

[12:22] <Xliff> https://em-content.zobj.net/source/animated-noto-color-emoji/356/rolling-on-the-floor-laughing_1f923.gif

[12:22] <Xliff> If only we could animate unicode.

[12:22] <Xliff> timo: no pets?

[12:22] <timo> no, just no killing of the cats

[12:27] <Xliff> Yeah. This is from way back in college. We abused "ROFL" for fun and profit back then.

[12:27] <Xliff> I'll have to be better about that, but "ROFLMAO" just didn't match the level of amusement.

[12:28] <Xliff> So why do you think "our %config" doesn't pick up the changes unless "%config<random-key> = DateTime.now" is present?

[13:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff Why are lubing your cats? (Maybe it is an Australian thing...)

[13:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff "If only we could animate unicode." -- I have been trying to figure out how to do animations in Jupyter notebooks, with a Raku kernel, for awhile. I strongly suspect a different solution that Jupyter is needed.

[13:28] <Xliff> antoncube: I am in the US, not Australia. Although I would love to visit there!

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh, dully noted. (And, I was not exercising Cunningham's Law...)

[13:32] *** ky1 left
[13:33] *** ky1 joined
[13:33] *** leah2 joined
[13:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As for animantions -- I have been curious how easy it is to re-implement this in Raku: https://nbedos.github.io/termtosvg/

[13:39] *** leah2 left
[13:40] *** leah2 joined
[13:49] <timo> well, jupyter allows you to embed arbitrary(?) HTML widgets with javascript, doesn't it? and i think there's some protocol to stream data back and forth between kernel and frontend as well that you can use together with that

[13:52] *** ky1 left
[13:53] *** ky1 joined
[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, the exchange is via ZeroMQ.

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But I would rather do the animations on "JavaScript level."

[13:55] <timo> when you use \r or "move cursor up" ansi escapes, and then print, the output cell on the jupyter notebook will also update, correct? that should be usable for simple things at least

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... it would be interesting to try that out.

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Unfortunately, the main JavaScript library I choose to invest for Raku graphics -- D3.js -- is not that good for dealing with images or interactive content.

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Animations by themselves are useful only to a point. A much more useful functionality is to have interactive interfaces. (JavaScript code generated using Raku code.)

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure that latter problem/task can be done using Jupyter. And, to some extend, I do not want to learn the Jupyter framework that much.

[14:02] *** ky1 left
[14:03] *** leah2 left
[14:03] *** ky1 joined
[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ideally, Raku I would have a notebook solution that is tailor-made from scratch using JavaScript (or TypeScript.)

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> a wild TiddlyWiki appears ðŸ˜›

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ha! Have not heard of it!

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was thinking hijacking WLJS in some way: https://jerryi.github.io/wljs-docs/

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See the dynamics section: https://jerryi.github.io/wljs-docs/frontend/Dynamics

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nijmegenzuigt> https://js.wiki/ maybe?

[14:09] <timo> building something compatible with ipython's widgets package would be a good thing in general, since things like euporia specifically support that

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is what "Jupyter::Kernel" is for.

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I consider Python is "too stupid" and worth investing time to know it better.

[14:11] <timo> this is less about python and more about the ecosystem of tools that work with the jupyter ecosystem

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If really want interactive functionalities for Raku, I will "finish" my Mathematica re-implementation in Raku and use the "RakuMode" connection in Mathematica notebooks.

[14:39] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> @lizmat - you donâ€™t need to golf it neither create issues - r3 tests are for GitHub issues in Rakudo repository , so that means in test named  1234 fails - there is issue number 1234 in Rakudo GitHub repo that describes and golfs that case , and now it fails under rakuast , 99% golf code is the what original issue author presented when created an use
