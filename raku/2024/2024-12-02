[13:11] <xinming> When I found  (my @x = (1..5, 8..10))   returns an array with 2 range objects, which suprise me. :-)

[13:11] <lizmat> perhaps https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/OneSeq is what you want?

[14:01] <timo> .tell raiph the performance of the fibonacci sequence code in raku is almost guaranteed to be due to the caching in the sequence operator, since the number of calls to generate a fibonacci sequence with the naive recursive approach is quadratic, it's not fair to compare one vs the other

[14:01] <tellable6> timo, I'll pass your message to raiph

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Any experts on SVG here?

[14:09] <lizmat> I know what it stands for  :-)

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 👍

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am interested in figuring out how much time to invest in making Raku produce SVG-based graphics for exploratory data analysis.

[14:12] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure librasteve would like it  :-)

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe it is a very good idea. But I have spent too much time "investing" in JavaScript graphcs.

[14:12] <lizmat> as would I  :-)

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok. Why would you? 🙂

[14:13] <lizmat> more modules == better  :-)

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ah, yeah, sure.

[14:14] <lizmat> seriously, I think I would use it at some point

[14:14] <lizmat> especially now since all browsers support them natively (right?)

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes.

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is the main reason I asked -- it seems it is much easier and portable to render SVG graphics in Jupyter notebooks.

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, GitHub does not render JavaScript plots in the Jupyter notebooks, but it does render the SVG ones.

[14:19] <lizmat> right, and SVG files would be easier to generate, no?

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure. That is an interesting general question -- that is why I asked for expert guidance/opinion. 🙂

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I just made this Jupyter notebook update to show SVG: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Presentations/Notebooks/Graph-neat-examples-set-1.ipynb

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Currently, I rarely generate SVG directly, but using the Graphviz framework (for graphs) to generate SVG images is really nice.

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, I can make SVG animations with Raku in Jupyter!

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Making animations with JavaScript within the Raku kernel is not easy. (To me, at least.)

[14:35] <xinming> Is there a way to get idx with .map method?

[14:36] <xinming> .grep has :k adverb to return idx. is it possible to additional add $idx of element being processed

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> @antononcube I'm certainly no expert, but was looking at https://www.pygal.org the other day to produce SVG markup for basic charts server-side (rather than using the Chart.js library in the browser client-side)

[14:36] <xinming> m: my @x = (<a b>, <c d>); for @x[]:kv -> $idx, @v { [$idx, @v].raku.say }; @x.map({ .raku.say }, :kv)

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there are options. anonymous state variable is one, or .kv'ing your iterable and then using a function with 2 arity to access index and value is another option

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> second one:

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> m: my @x = <y e s>; @x.kv.map({ say "idx: $^idx, val: $^val" })

[14:37] <evalable6> nahita3882, rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «idx: 0, val: y␤idx: 1, val: e␤idx: 2, val: s␤»

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  idx: 0, val: y idx: 1, val: e idx: 2, val: s 

[14:38] <xinming> m: my @x = (<a b>, <c d>); for @x[]:kv -> $idx, @v { [$idx, @v].raku.say }; @x[]:p.map({ .raku.say }, :kv)

[14:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «[0, ("a", "b")]␤[1, ("c", "d")]␤0 => $("a", "b")␤1 => $("c", "d")␤»

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @holmdunc  I experimented with "Chart.js", since I wanted a simpler more pre-canned way to produce graphics than D3.js. Decided to bet / invest on Google Charts.

[14:41] <xinming> I just backlog, And I asked once not long ago. Seems I'm going old and being forgetful. :-(

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> Yeah I tried Google's some years ago, seemed good too. The main thing I wanna avoid with charts is rendering to an actual bitmap image server-side, because then you get stuff like the font rendering looking wrong compared to the rest of the text on screen

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, it seems that LLMs know SVG pretty well. So, "plunging into" SVG graphics via Raku for data analysis might not be that frustrating...

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For me, the decoration graphics elements are very important. It is easy to make a bar chart (in SVG or whatever.) The hard thing is to have all bar chart options, like, grid lines, ticks, tick labels, axes labels, plot label, callouts, tooltips, etc. That is why I worked with D3.js a lot. (Again, for/within Raku.)

[17:05] <[Coke]> is there a secret to writing a reduce with a comparator instead of a normal operator?

[17:05] <[Coke]> I want something like [<] but with a &strictly-monotonic or something.

[17:11] <[Coke]> I guess the secret is: not actually a straight reduction like it would be with the &plus example.

[17:12] <guifa> with a traditiona comparator?  .min(&strictly-monotonic)

[17:12] <guifa> or .max(&strictly-monotonic)

[17:12] <guifa> err

[17:12] <guifa> no

[17:12] <guifa> sorry that's not te same thing ignore my thinking outloud

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But why specifying reduce in that way would work? Also, maybe &strictly-monotonic has to be made listable?

[17:15] <[Coke]> m: say [<] <1 2 3 4>; say [+] <1 2 3 4> # these seem to work differently

[17:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «True␤10␤»

[17:16] <[Coke]> and I can implement the latter with a custom routine, but not the former.

[17:16] <guifa> I've decided I need to port Mozilla's Readability

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To be clear, I think you are trying to do [and] |@a.rotor(2=>-1).map({ &strictly-monotic(|$_) })

[17:22] <[Coke]> yup, just was hoping for the better syntax.

[17:34] *** dakkar left
[17:37] <ab5tract> "and I can implement the latter with a custom routine, but not the former." <-- [Coke], do you mean that you can't create a custom infix that behaves like the comparator?

[17:38] <ab5tract> just wanted to make sure that you are implementing a slurpy candidate for such a custom infix routine, if so

[17:40] <ab5tract> ISTR having trouble with reduce unless I provided a slurpy version.

[17:49] <[Coke]> trying...

[17:49] <guifa> oh yeah

[17:49] <guifa> it does do better with slurpy because of the zero case I think

[17:50] *** yewscion left
[17:51] <[Coke]> if I do slurpy, then I can get get the first two args... then I can get the comparator... but then I'm getting 1,2, then True and 3, then True and 4... 

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I should have said "slurpy" instead of "listable" ...

[17:51] <[Coke]> so I'm still not able to do the comparison on each two.

[17:51] <[Coke]> so I think I still have to write this with the rotor so I can compare pairwise.

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Right, that is why I said that I do no expect reduce to work.

[17:52] <[Coke]> Yup.

[18:46] <guifa> Compare the following

[18:46] <guifa> m: sub infix:<`> (*@args) is assoc<left> { say @args }; 1 ` 2 ` 3 ` 4 ` 5

[18:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «[1 2]␤[True 3]␤[True 4]␤[True 5]␤»

[18:46] <guifa> m: sub infix:<`> (*@args) is assoc<list> { say @args }; 1 ` 2 ` 3 ` 4 ` 5

[18:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «[1 2]␤[2 3]␤[3 4]␤[4 5]␤»

[18:48] <[Coke]> it's a sub, not an operator.

[18:48] <[Coke]> though I guess I could make it an operator.

[18:50] <[Coke]> m: sub infix:<WAT>(*@args) is assoc<chain> { @args[0] < @args[1] }; say [[&infix:<WAT>]] <1 2 3 4 3>

[18:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[18:50] <[Coke]> ^^ doesn't seem to help there.

[18:52] <guifa> Sometimes the list can be the easier one -- then you can do more complicated logic since you'll access to every single member

[18:52] <guifa> but you could also maybe do

[18:55] *** sena_kun joined
[18:56] <guifa> m: sub foo { say "custom monotonic sub" }; sub infix:<`> (*@args, :$with) is assoc<list> { $with(); say @args }; 1 ` 2 ` 3 ` 4 ` 5 :with(&foo)

[18:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar dd45859fe: OUTPUT: «custom monotonic sub␤[1 2 3 4 5]␤»

[18:56] <guifa> basically, you now have an adverb'ed listy operator, so you can do a customized reduction with whatever function (obviously changing the interior of those subs to match the behavior you want)

[19:02] <[Coke]> the list could have hundreds of elements, I'm not going to do individual operators between

[19:08] <botato> Coke: I assume it's for today's advent of code, mscha had a clever way: https://github.com/mscha/aoc/blob/master/aoc2024/aoc02
