[08:49] <Voldenet> I'm suspecting that value semantics for things will need to get implemented at some points

[08:49] <Voldenet> because NativeCall doesn't handle structs now, only pointers to structs

[08:50] <Voldenet> which probably would add value semantics to regular subroutines

[08:50] <Voldenet> which would probably lead to implementing value semantics for lists

[08:54] <Voldenet> it's a lot of "probably" in that, changing those semantics for lists could be breaking change somewhere

[09:00] <Voldenet> Btw, that approach using `WHICH` is really slow

[09:00] <Voldenet> eqv can compare lists more cheaply

[13:29] <tbrowder__> antononcube: i can't see my msg here, but i'm forking yr prob repo. you would be better off if you would use App::Mi6 to help manage yr repos.

[13:29] <tbrowder__> have you also tried to zef install . --debug ?

[13:36] <tbrowder__> using mi6 to upload is much better. it does some xtra checking

[13:38] <tbrowder__> using Mi6::Helper "helps" start a new repo project. converting an old one is a small but worthwhile effort. i would be happy to submit  PR tondo that if you wish.

[13:39] <tbrowder__> afk&

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Somehow it is not easy to find...

[14:21] <tbrowder__> use Raku.land

[14:22] <tbrowder__> mi6 is App::Mi6

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok.

[14:22] <tbrowder__> mi6-helper is in Mi6::Helper

[14:24] <tbrowder__> i probably need to update mi6-helper repo tags in the meta file

[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Thanks for the advice to use "App::Mi6" -- it helped identify the problem.

[19:49] <[Coke]> you can ask codesections or someone on the board to introduce you to the GC chair.

[19:49] <[Coke]> several of us used to be involved ore directly but it's... been a while

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat "Anton Antonov continues to dissect speeches and articles using LLM functions. This week even twice [...]" -- given some of the screaming I get one might think I am doing vivisection.

[19:52] <lizmat> heh...  modern politics appears to be about screaming a lot  :-(

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I try to just present the tools, so people can consume politics writings better. (I hope.) But I think my expositions are too succint to be considered unbiased.

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, I applied the prompt "FindPropagandaMessage" to Stephen Wolfram's latest article ("Can AI solve science?") and people from the Wolfram community is ask me / told me why did I do that. According to them the article is non-political.

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, perhaps, but applying the prompt and reading the outcomes we can state that for sure.

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Anyway, I removed that propaganda section for Wolram's site. Raku community, of course, got the full version.

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vrurg Because I got distracted working on Stephen Wolfram's article and "WWW::Gemini" I did not make the LLaMA video I promised. I hope I will do it today or tomorrow.

[20:00] <lizmat> antononcube: having more tools will help in these days of PR overflowing

[20:00] <lizmat> antononcube: but trust in these tools is even more important

[20:00] <lizmat> otherwise they become a PR tool themselves  :-(

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is seems relevant:

[22:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> arun: as an observer it looks to me like code sections immutable data structures never got off the ground

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> imo raku can get close to this model with the relatively recent ValueList, ValueObj modules since these pin the contents of immutable structures (so they cannot contain containers and can have WHICH semantics eg for set ops)

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> deep immutables are not free in that your code can lose data locality / cache performance and so while i think having deep immutables is a worthy long term goal, there is not much you cannot already do with the Value modules
