[02:47] <jdv> hit the fdr or the belt or midtown almost any day:)

[02:48] <[Coke]> I am from a small town in upstate NY, so yeah that would do it. :)

[02:51] <jdv> geez

[03:33] <[Coke]> Trying to change ls colors on zsh on mac is apparently non-trivial. :|

[03:36] *** xinming left

[11:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hm... I waited and waited for 2024.05 and two days ago I installed / primed 2024.04.

[11:16] <lizmat> releasable6: status

[11:16] <releasable6> lizmat, Next release in ≈1 day and ≈7 hours. 1 blocker. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[11:16] <releasable6> lizmat, Details: https://gist.github.com/71670c9d7242ec0ac1140575fcd0dd63

[11:16] <lizmat> antononcube you can ask for the ETA

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ✍️

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I use these lines in my "~/.zshrc" (on macOS) and I get colors:  export PS1="[%T]%2/> " export LSCOLORS="Gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad"

[12:10] <El_Che> lizmat: as in today? In that case, I'll release that

[12:10] <El_Che> a, 1 day

[12:10] <El_Che> will do that then

[12:11] <lizmat> Q: do older releases remain available?   if so, it would be nice to have the missing releases as well

[12:12] <El_Che> yes, until we run out of space

[12:13] <lizmat> and who determines the size / cost of that space ?

[12:16] <El_Che> I have an opensource account on cloudsmith.

[12:16] <El_Che> ik see I use 14g of 50g

[12:16] <El_Che> -k

[12:17] <lizmat> ok, so that should allow for quite a few releases still, right ?

[12:17] <lizmat> it's not like we're storing Netflix movies  :-)

[12:20] <El_Che> yeah, a few years

[12:20] <El_Che> if nothing changes

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In a few years one can generate and reproduce "Netfix movies" in full using LLM functionalities in Raku.

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, no need to plan for storage that large.

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, reproducing all of Raku's code base is harder. (Say, after 5 years...)

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Algorithm::Tree" is nice / interesting. Unfortunately, it does not work correctly.

[21:27] <tellable6> 2024-04-26T15:56:55Z #raku <tbrowder> melezhik: i think one of the raku advents discussed a terminal prog of some kind

[21:27] <tellable6> 2024-04-26T16:14:40Z #raku <tbrowder> melezhik: Terminal::Graphing::BarCharts may be a starting point

[21:28] <melezhik> I've added 2 authentication schemas to Sparky, default one does not need any extrenal provider, for simple use case - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/docs/auth.md
