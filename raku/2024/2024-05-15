[05:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: what do you have in mind? maybe a couple of blogs? or video shorts?

[05:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> here’s something i did for the sister module CLI::AWS to pull together some advent stuff https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2022/12/29/raku-cli-aws-postvent/ … suggest I make a similar follow on blog(s) for CLI::Wordpress that shows how they work together … video of this in action is most compelling imo since one of the quirks of CLI::Wordpress is that it needs to run on a cloud based machine

[11:54] <tbrowder> librasteve: thnks, i  remember that. 

[11:57] <tbrowder> how much effort would it take to use something like vultr or digital ocean (or one's own apache2 server)?

[11:59] <tbrowder> probably a bunch. i'm always looking for an easy solution...

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: I built CLI::AWS::EC2-Simple and CLI::Wordpress to work together for my needs (since these were just pieces I use at $day-job), but they were done in a separable way.

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just to take CLI::Wordpress, the prerequisite is a unix box (only ubuntu is tested) with Docker, Docker Compose and raku installed... then you would ssh in and zef install CLI::Wordpress (see details in the README) then you can use the rawp cmd to launch, run and manage a vanilla Wordpress site

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> by launch, I mean it automatically (i) starts 5 Docker images (wordpress, nginx, wpcli, db and fileshare iirc) - we need nginx to make your wp production worthy - these will all autorestart on a stop/start cycle btw, (ii) starts nginx in http mode, requests a certbox certificate, restarts nginx in https mode and (iii) if you ask, sets up cron for the certbox auto-renewal

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have never used vultr or digital ocean, but any EC-2 like hosted machine with an IP address should be the same  - so ... llet me know which parts of this (if any) that you need to be a public example

[18:38] <ab5tract> for those on x64 CPUs, I'd love to see the current performance ratio for R#1421 when JIT is involved
