[02:46] <japhb> Just going to leave this here, because I'm proud of how it turned out: https://gist.github.com/japhb/bb896afd7292fd55ccf99673236f9857

[02:46] <japhb> It's an example of the markup required to make a menu translatable in the newest Terminal-Widgets release (0.1.1)

[02:52] <japhb> And an example of what a translation table looks like: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-TUI/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/TUI/Translations/Test.rakumod

[19:11] <leont> Yeah, will clean it up and merge it.

[19:12] <leont> I am wondering what the example-config.t is doing? What is it actually testing? Aren't other tests already doing that much more in depth?

[19:25] <leont> Like if it's supposed to test the that the example in the doc is correct, it sounds more like an author test

[21:48] <japhb> I think SIGTSTP is suspend ("Terminal SToP"), SIGCONT is CONTinue

[21:49] <japhb> See https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/blob/main/lib/Terminal/LineEditor/RawTerminalInput.rakumod#L570-L588

[22:31] <leont> Yeah, SIGTSTP is the little brother of SIGSTOP (difference is that the latter can't be blocked but the former can)

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> smokemachine: did you try parens in/around the where clause?

[23:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (maybe precendence is biting you)

[23:12] <SmokeMachine> yes... I did... this was how I found that problem: https://github.com/FCO/HTML-Component/blob/fc4286c3565c4d7c20dabbf696be50c6b8a80576/lib/HTML/Component/CroRouter.rakumod#L38
