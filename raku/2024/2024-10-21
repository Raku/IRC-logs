[08:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is it true that AT-POS can take only integer arguments? Is it possible to make expressions like this one $m[‚Äòa‚Äô] work ?

[08:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I can use AT-KEY, but when $m above is a matrix, $m<a> seems ‚Äúmisleading.‚Äù

[08:39] <lizmat> m: class A { method AT-POS($) { 42 } }; my @a is A; say @a["foobar"]

[08:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b51c4a42: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[08:39] <lizmat> antononcube ^^ is that an answer ?

[08:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Yes, it is. (Then something is wrong with my AT-POS implementation...)

[08:53] *** sena_kun joined
[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Please see the output of this code:  my class A { method AT-POS($_) { say $_.WHAT; 42 } }; my @a is A;  say @a["foobar"] 

[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It prints out "(Failure)".

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> m: class A { method AT-POS($) { say $.WHAT; 42 } }; my @a is A;  say @a["foobar"];

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (Failure) 42 

[09:02] <lizmat> antononcube looks like the postcircumfix is forcing numbers

[09:02] <lizmat> m: my class A { method AT-POS($_) { 42 } }; my @a is A; multi postcircumfix:<[ ]>(A:D $a, $b) { $a.AT-POS($b) }; say @a["foobar"]

[09:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b51c4a42: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[09:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Makes sense. (AT-POS is fine, and bad, bad, postcircufix[].)

[09:14] *** Aedil left
[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Thanks again -- I figured out the correct incantations for AT-POS and postcirumfix<[]> for my class.

[09:39] <lizmat> yw  :-)

[13:52] <SmokeMachine> Hi! I was thinking and I don't know it the css selector purely would make sense for our AST... for example, how to describe a infix where left is a int? with the way I was going, it could be something like: `ast-query infix, :left[ast-query number]` (or something like that... with the css selector, how would that be? `.infix[left=???]`? how to make a node on a specific position of another node? `.infix[left=.number]`? but shouldn't 

[13:52] <SmokeMachine> that be a string?

[13:53] <SmokeMachine> maybe it would just make sense to nothing be a string (unless you add "")

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine It will help you put a clear mission statement and a description of what "ASTQuery" is facilitating and/or doing in : https://github.com/FCO/ASTQuery

[13:57] <SmokeMachine> another thing is I want to make simple to just "ignore" statement-list (I'm still not sure if that's a good idea), so you would not need to add the statement list (or any other node between the if and the statement like expression) when you want to match a `if` with a assignment as first line, for example...

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right now, I am thinking that "ASTQuery" is "just" a way to scan trees produced by RakuAST.

[13:58] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: the problem is that I'm not sure of what that should be... I'm still exploring...

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, great. I few exploratory actitivities: 1. Can you answer the "Five Whys" for "ASTQuery" ? 2. Why "plain" Raku cannot do what "ASTQuery" does? 3. What would "ASTQuery" help? 3.1. Learning how Raku works 3.2. Helping making new language implementations 4. Can "ASTQuery" be replaced by conversion of RakuAST outputs into XML and using XPath? 5. What is the query language of "ASTQuery"? 5.1. Typical Raku statements

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> 5.2. A specialized DSL (or two)

[14:06] <SmokeMachine> Why "plain" Raku cannot do what "ASTQuery" does? - It can, I just want to make it simpler in a declarative way.

[14:07] <SmokeMachine> What would "ASTQuery" help? - to make mathing RakuAST nodes easier (at least that's the intent)

[14:08] <SmokeMachine> Can "ASTQuery" be replaced by conversion of RakuAST outputs into XML and using XPath? - I don't think so, but I could be wrong...

[14:09] <SmokeMachine> What is the query language of "ASTQuery"? I'm still trying to decide... but I'm tending to typical raku statements or a slang...

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "make it simpler in a declarative way." -- this points to answers of the DSL question, then. üôÇ

[14:11] <SmokeMachine> another point is that the return of that should make it possible to change the code's ast...

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, that is related to 3.2 above.

[14:12] <SmokeMachine> and I also would like to make it usable in tools like rak to search for code in files....

[14:13] <SmokeMachine> and also write a module using that that could warn if it finds any trap (https://docs.raku.org/language/traps) in your code....

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Great. Ideally, all these comments / answers should be in https://github.com/FCO/ASTQuery with related progress tracking and examples.

[14:20] <SmokeMachine> https://chatgpt.com/share/67166305-9168-8001-a331-a65547df7f1d

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think it will help that you put in the content of the README file and/or the ASTQuery IRC discussion from yesterday.

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my suggestion (purely optional) would be to create (or find) one MVP example that illustrates and can be used a test bed for the key features you want ... this is what I did with the synopsis at https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTML-Functional to give you an idea ... it's OK to prioritise and backlog some of the features in order to get started as soon as you think you have something useful

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the CSS selector topic, it is possible that I may have over encouraged that path (I do not know rakuAST at all, so have no way of knowing what are the characteristices of a node that can be selected on) ... I was thinking last night that maybe text matching (or a combination of text and other features) is more applicable

[16:01] <Geth> ¬¶ raku.org: patrickbkr++ created pull request #224: Fix broken impl download link

[16:05] <[Coke]> any windows users here - does windows have a "primary group" in the same way that linux does? I see a mention of it in the context of AD and posix, but what about just "whoami /groups" ?

[16:08] <ugexe> my gut is we should look at what libuv does/says

[16:10] <ugexe> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/94e467ad93231722df5372eded4ec9d5c84083ae/src/win/util.c#L1155-L1156 maybe

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I participated in the Wolfram Technology Conference (WTC) 2024 last week. One big conclusion -- on which I cannot elaborate for now -- is that you are right to work on the Dan packages.

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh that's very encouraging to hear ... thanks for the feedback
