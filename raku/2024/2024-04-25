[04:16] <rir_> Just moved from amd64 2022.12 to 2024.03 on linux and https://github.com/0rir/touch  gives all errors to tests.  Mostly 10  but up to over 18 billion off.  Touch is pretty simple: use Native timepec's to adjust mtime and atime of files.  Any ideas of what may have changed?  

[04:17] <rir_> ^ billion seconds off.

[08:57] <lizmat> rir_: is that code using nqp::time by any chance?

[08:58] <lizmat> if so: that was changed at some point to return nano-seconds rather than seconds, I think

[10:37] <jdv> i'd have to check but i think "zef install Cro::HTTP::Client" takes longer than "make spectest".  kinda odd:)

[11:00] <jdv> just kidding.  guess something was going on locally... the install takes 3:44 and the test takes 6:13.

[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For a certain project I have to have a few Raku packages hosted in the same Git folder. Can zef handle installations from Git sub-folders? (I assume "no.") Is having a CLI script that clones/updates the repository and does zef installations in each of the sub-folders a good (or best) approach?

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/ imo, this problem solving issue has "bottomed out" https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/407 (chained sequences) with a consensus that there is a bug in relationship to the endpoint of sequences behaving oddly when two are chained with a comma. Shall I go ahead and write a new short  bug report issue and close the problem solver?

[18:51] <ab5tract> has this diverged from Pod6 and/or RakuDoc?

[18:54] <lizmat> yeah, looks like: we tried

[20:04] <ab5tract> bummer

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Too many formats

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dr.shuppet In general? Or you mean Pod6/RakuDoc/podlite?

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> In general, this is an example of that

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dr.shuppet  https://xkcd.com/927/

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> That comes back to the Council of Pisa already: "It attempted to end the Western Schism by deposing Benedict XIII (Avignon) and Gregory XII (Rome) for schism and manifest heresy. The College of Cardinals, composed of members of both the Avignon Obedience and the Roman Obedience, who were recognized by each other and by the Council, then elected a third papal claimant, Alexander V, who lived only a few months."

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> The new Pisan pope died soon, but was followed by another Pisan pope

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> So there were three popes for quit a while, until the Council of Constance

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Reminds of a chapter from the book "The March of Folly"
