[20:25] <Xliff> Good afternoon!

[20:25] <Xliff> Does anyone know if Raku has a gettext implementation?

[20:30] *** yewscion joined
[20:35] *** yewscion left
[20:46] <guifa> gettext itself?  I don't think so.  I had worked on a whiiiiiiile ago a version of Fluent

[20:47] <guifa> but I really don't want to look at my code for that -- I think it will give me nightmares looking at my Raku coding style from 5+ years ago

[22:06] <timo> botato: hey could you run rakudo with --ll-exception and reproduce the errors from the parallel user-agent thing, and see if the backtraces have more stuff near the top?

[22:20] *** MoC left
[22:54] <guifa> alright -- now that I've been using cro and WWW::LLaMA I'm starting to really enjoy just how easy it is for Raku to glue this stuff together into a functioning server

[22:54] <guifa> honestly this might be a good talk for next year's TPRC

[23:30] *** abraxxa-home left
[23:31] <botato> timo: ok, I moved the bug to MoarVM as suggested (https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1864) and there I linked the backtraces with --ll-exception

[23:32] <botato> btw does anyone have tips for tracking done memory leaks in native bindings? I'm trying to debug a memory leak in findnodes of LibXML

[23:35] <botato> I wanted to use ltrace to see all calls it's actually making to libxml2, but in ltrace results I don't see them, just calls to libc, MVM_vm_run_file, some calls to free, then MVM_vm_exit. anyone got ltrace working or other tips for tracing or debugging native bindings?

[23:35] <botato> s/done/down

[23:35] <timo> could be that the way dyncall makes the calls is not being seen by ltrace, though i don't know how exactly ltrace operates

[23:35] <timo> how much experience do you have with gdb?

[23:38] <botato> i used to write C, and exploits for memory corruption vulns, so I spent a lot of time in gdb then, but that was over 10 years ago

[23:55] <tbrowder> m: my $a = “5a”; say “5a”. base(10);

[23:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar fd29555b1: OUTPUT: «No such method 'base' for string '5a'.  Did you mean any of these:␤'Bag', 'Date', 'Hash', 'are', 'asec', 'byte', 'hash', 'take'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:55] <tbrowder> should be base(16) i think

[23:56] <tbrowder> m: my $a=“5a”; say $a.base(16)

[23:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar fd29555b1: OUTPUT: «No such method 'base' for string '5a'.  Did you mean any of these:␤'Bag', 'Date', 'Hash', 'are', 'asec', 'byte', 'hash', 'take'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:58] <tbrowder> arg, parse-base…

[23:59] <tbrowder> m: my $a = “5a”; my $b = $a.parse-base(16); say $b

[23:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar fd29555b1: OUTPUT: «90␤»
