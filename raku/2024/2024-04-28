[02:05] <ab5tract> It happens both on macOS and in a Debian container. Both are fresh installs via ‚Äòzef install Whateverable‚Äô

[02:19] <ab5tract> updated the gist with `zef locate` results and a clue:

[02:20] <ab5tract> `zef info Whateverable` -> "... Provides: 15 modules"

[02:20] <ab5tract> `cat Whateverable/META6.json | jq ".provides | length"` -> 17

[03:01] <ugexe> zef look Whateverable 

[03:01] <ugexe> then cat META6.json

[03:01] <ugexe> It might be the version archived in rea is an older version than the repo HEAD

[03:02] *** jpn joined
[03:03] <ugexe> otherwise just do ‚Äòzef instal $url-to-whateversble-git-repo

[03:03] <ugexe> (Which would ensure you are instaing from HEAD)

[13:22] <tbrowder> ab5tract: hi, i went back and looked at the callsame msg. that wasn't needed. i did use 2 overlapping subset defs but Raku cleverly didn't confuse the two in my use. you can see my working code now in my https://github.com/tbrowder/text-

[13:22] <ab5tract> clipped URL :/

[13:23] <tbrowder> https://github.com/tbrowder/Text-Utils

[13:23] <tbrowder> branch "next-ver"

[13:24] <tbrowder> :\

[13:25] <tbrowder> sub normalize-string

[13:27] <tbrowder> all the tests work

[13:27] <ab5tract> nice, I'm glad you were able to unlock this!

[13:30] <tbrowder> raku is so cool; i hate that perl ppl don't understand the step up and seem to refuse to. was a no-brainer for my simple self to see Larry's vision of the next step was super and easier for new ppl, imho.

[13:32] <tbrowder> course i waited too long to go from perl v4 to v5 so i can't bad-mouth anyone.

[13:43] <ab5tract> Agreed. There's so many dynamics to unpack with the Perl 5 -> Perl 6 story that I think the actual language evolution is unfortunately low on the list of considerations and talking points

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> It seems to me that it went something like this: 1. Perl 6 is incomplete and probably won't ever be complete, we'll stick to using Perl 5, which is stable and tested by time 2. Oops, Perl 5 is outdated, Perl 6 is completed but everyone is already using Python

[13:46] <tbrowder> yepper

[13:47] <tbrowder> imho: Python, the PITA lang

[13:48] <tbrowder> "we don't like sigils, so we use spaces to mean everything"

[13:49] <tbrowder> "let the compiler handle it, just trust us, nothing to see here"

[13:49] <tbrowder> rant...

[13:50] <tbrowder> 'scuse me, too much coffee

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> The irony is that a part of the Perl community just wants Perl to slowly die as a legacy language rather than to evolve

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> I was downvoted by people on r/Perl for saying the language itself isn't as bad

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> About Python: my first internship project was in Python, and I was left with an obsession with making flake8 pass by adjusting the right indentations and stuff for quite some time

[14:14] <jdv> raku is "not there yet" for a bunch of my use cases.  i suspect that's the same for a bunch of others.

[14:14] <jdv> meanwhile perl is there and works for more use cases

[14:14] <lizmat> jdv: OOC what do you miss most?

[14:14] <jdv> you know:)

[14:15] <jdv> sadly, i've been beating the same drum since xmas:(

[14:15] <jdv> and there have been great strides since then.  its just taking a very long time.

[14:16] <ab5tract> jdv: I don't know :)

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Perl 5 is still a great language, if the resources and ecosystem were a bit more welcoming, it would be quite decent IMO

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> It has the "unfair" advantage of being installed on every Unix system, unlike Raku and similarly to Python

[14:19] <jdv> perf

[14:20] <tbrowder> jdv: perf?

[14:22] <jdv> runtime but mostly compile time performance

[14:25] <tbrowder> ah, of course. doesn‚Äôt bother me much. and most of my $work with perl was as a glue language plus writing code for fortran to run on big many.-core ‚Äúsuper computers‚Äù

[14:40] <ab5tract> ooc, what kind tasks is compile time performance impeding? feel free to ignore the question if you don't want to answer or if its $work-sensitive

[14:41] <ab5tract> jdv: btw, as we speak my first genuine local run of Blin seems to be in progress

[14:44] <jdv> nice

[14:45] <jdv> compile time - regex/gramars and "dev cycle", for me

[14:46] <jdv> i had a rando smallish project (the only raku i've gotten to prod yet) (< dozen files, < 1k lines) took ~7s to "compile"

[14:48] <jdv> it might be better now.  this was 2020 or 21.

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well you have to install the right python over the system python in unix (not so for perl)

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jdv: don't try Rust ;)

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder> "'scuse me, too much coffee" -- It might be age related too...

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> The compile time makes Raku a poor substitute for shell scripts, unlike Perl

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder And, of course, by "age" I mean "experience."

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dr.shuppet "Perl 5 is still a great language, [...]" -- At this point I can stand reading Perl 5 code. It might be because Perl 5 and Raku are "divided by common mindset" -- too similar and too different at same time.

[15:05] <ab5tract> I don't see compilation speeds as a blocker to most shell scripts, but I recognize that's a personal thing

[15:30] <ugexe> i just released v0.22.0 of zef which allows a positional argument '-' to slurp from stdin for `zef install ...` so users can pipe a list of stuff to install. this is based on the conversation the other day for how to reinstall modules from one raku installation to another

[15:31] <ugexe> `echo Foo::Bar | zef install CSV::Parser -` would install CSV::Parser and Foo::Bar

[15:32] <ugexe> also allows like `cat my-modules-to-always-install.txt | zef install -`

[15:35] <ab5tract> ugexe++ very nice!

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Nowadays developers will tell you the only supported way is to use a Docker container üò≠
