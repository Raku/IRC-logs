[13:45] <melezhik> o/

[13:46] <melezhik> I am playing with Cro WebSockets, seems like cro ws does some buffering befiore send data to client, can I disable it?

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> (just a disclaimer that if you don't get an answer, maybe it's also worth trying in the #cro chat)

[13:48] <melezhik> Thanks, nemokosch

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm kind of a dummy to Cro but maybe somebody else knows regardless ðŸ˜…

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Cro is great, but too big and too heavy. I will have to try bumbling bee by @rf â€¦

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> bumbling bee

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> ðŸ˜„

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, obviously I am trying to provoke a reaction from @rf , if he is around â€¦

[15:08] <Voldenet> I've read the docs of cro websockets and it's pretty similar to how js web api's websocket works

[15:10] <Voldenet> iirc the only way to 'wait' for the peer I found was to get some sort of response

[15:17] <Voldenet> (the ws itself has the property with bytes count, but it isn't reliable for this)

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> OpenAI has a text-to-speech service now. I spent some time yesterday hooking it up to "WWW::OpenAI". (See "ver<0.2.18+>".)
