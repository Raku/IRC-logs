[12:11] <tbrowder> need some advice, pls: i have a class that encapsulates all glyph info on one font at one scaled size. i want it to have a method to calculate the several attributes of a string set with that class and pass all to a caller. the returned object would be a struct in C++. would (or could) such an object in Raku be an "is built" class? in short, what does the "is built" trait mean?

[12:13] <tbrowder> hm, i could just as well return a Hash

[12:16] <tbrowder> never mind. got it. thanks.

[16:58] <guifa> hooray

[16:58] <guifa> I now have a functioning canvas-y like module

[16:58] <guifa> make a canvas with a height/width, and then it opens up a window you can draw in

[16:58] <guifa> right now hyper limited (pixel only drawing, and mac only) but hey, it's a start

[16:59] <lizmat> guifa++

[17:00] <guifa> but it does have two way communication between the canvas process so could lead way to clickable elements too

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting.

[17:19] <guifa> Unfortuately right now you can't just send a gazillion operations at once, as I'm lazy and using a WebView canvas

[17:20] <guifa> and I think if I make too many calls to JS at once some wires get crossed and it crashes, so I probably need to make a queue but I'm *really* lazy lol

[17:27] *** gfldex left
[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa So, my "JavaScript::D3" is better than yours!

[17:33] *** gfldex joined
[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do have the problem that JS graphics (and, hence, "JavaScript::D3") do not render reliably in Jupyter.

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa I have been thinking what would be a Raku-graphics system developed "from scratch." I assume your "Canvas" efforts are from that POV?

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I am only interested in hijacking some established solutions, not developing a graphics system from scratch.)

[17:37] <guifa> I guess yeah.  Basically you'll say Canvas.new(width => ..., height => ...); and then set pixels with, e.g. Canvas.pixel(x,y,r,g,b)

[17:37] <guifa> the first one launches the subprocess with the height/width args, and then a communication link is formed

[17:38] <guifa> commands are literally as simple as "pixel(50,50,0,0,0)" which sets the pixel at 50,50 to black

[17:38] <guifa> or title("Foo") which sets the title bar 

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 👍

[17:39] <guifa> obvs next is to add basic line / rect support. image will be trickier

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right, that is why I use "D3.js" those kind of things are solved.

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And 'Google Charts" is even more "pre-canned."

[17:41] <guifa> I like doing the lower level stuff ha (although just getting a raw set of bytes to write into for graphics is surprisingly more complicated than I thought it would be, so much is designed to be much more higher level)

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> A binding to this could be good for easy pixel-level drawing https://github.com/emoon/minifb

[17:48] *** Aedil joined
[17:51] <guifa> ah that's basically what I'm doing haha

[17:51] *** skyesoss joined
[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> HTML <canvas> is probably better though, cos on most OS its drawing functions are likely GPU-accelerated

[18:02] <guifa> And any system that supports a WebView will have it work.  It also has a really simple mental model, which is good enough for me.  If I need more, if I've got a simple enough protocol I can switch to another library later

[18:36] <[Coke]> the authors and auth for raku/doc is listed as "perl6" - it's not currently installable, but I want to update those. any issue just changing them to "raku" ?
