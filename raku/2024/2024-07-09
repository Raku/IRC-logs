[14:28] <tbrowder> hi, anybody build and publish any casks for homebrew?

[14:30] <lizmat> Xliff: L10N was taken out of core

[15:03] <tbrowder> lizmat: what do you think about having two more raku irc channels: raku-windows and raku-macos? the channels would be for discussing howto and porting issues for those os‚Äôs. i want to build necessary raku apps so my modules can at least run on linux AND mac.

[15:05] <lizmat> at this point in time, I'd say that was overkill: we don't have a lot of traffic...  and for those issues, I think #raku-dev would suffice for the moment?

[15:46] <tbrowder> ok

[19:23] <[Coke]> vim question - what's the magic to search for the literal ~= - just backslashing the characters in insufficient.

[19:24] <[Coke]> I feel like I should have solved this in the THIRTY FIVE years i've been using vi.

[19:26] <lucs> I believe you need to backslash the tilde only, but there are settings that may affect how regexes are interpreted.

[19:26] *** soverysour left
[19:27] <lucs> Er, when you say 'magic', do you mean what Vim means if you lookup ":help magic"?

[19:28] <[Coke]> I didn't mean literally magic.

[19:28] <[Coke]> thank you, escaping ONLY the ~ was key.

[19:28] <[Coke]> \~\= seems to just find the next character.

[19:36] <lucs> Yeah, tilde alone in a regex is special, as is \= :-)

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> For people reading this in Discord, some backslashes are not being shown, eh, too bad.

[19:38] <[Coke]> feels like ~ is only special when substituting, not searching, and it's getting the substitute treatment in vim.

[19:39] <lucs> Hmm... I seem to need to escape it even when just searching for it.

[19:42] <[Coke]> ok, I have to remember \V~=

[21:32] <Xliff> OK. I'm trying to write some reusable code in Raku, but for reasons... they need to be macros.

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> What's your preferred editor? Maybe you use different ones depending on what you're working on?

[21:34] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/aa252e991b97ba4f7fd0693cf3e9e6f1

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lucs For a long time I prefered Emacs for almost everything. I think that stopped ‚âà 2012. Right now -- more Raku-wise -- I using Commaide to for wrting Raku packages and Jupyter notebooks in VS Code ("chatboos", actually) to do research or visualizations with Raku. I tried Emacs and Raku and did not like it; nevertheless I use it time-to-time, mostly, for debugging.

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do use Emacs with org-mode a lot, BTW.
