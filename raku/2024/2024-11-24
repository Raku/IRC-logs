[12:55] <tbrowder> yo, i just learned the importance of the INIT phaser: i had to use it to finish defining my global hash when the BEGIN phaser couldn't handle it 'cause the required sub (executable) wasn't yet contructed.

[12:56] <tbrowder> i think that's what timo warned about

[12:56] <tbrowder> and others

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Talk to @habere-et-dispar about PDF calendar making (in Raku.)

[14:23] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thanks for letting me know! I also saw your commands… looks interesting !

[14:27] <lizmat> FWIW, the latest REPL module also does Raku completions now

[14:28] <SmokeMachine> Interesting!

[14:28] <SmokeMachine> On commands, should s/ass-method/add-command/ on read me?

[14:39] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: ??

[14:40] <SmokeMachine> (Sorry, I’m on cellphone…) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/unVpHgNf/1732459238.JPG

[14:41] <lizmat> that says "add-method" ?

[14:42] <lizmat> aah.... not "ass-"  :-)

[14:42] <lizmat> yeah, it should

[14:43] <lizmat> fixed in repo, thanks!

[14:49] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, I didn’t see the typo… I’m very sorry…

[14:49] <lizmat> no worries  :-)
