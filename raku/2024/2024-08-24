[04:55] <wayland76> tbrowder: Yeah, it's very nice, but I do most of my raku work in docker, but this one has to run on my local, and it's a version of raku that's too old to have AST.  So I've put it on the back burner for now.

[12:37] <tbrowder> [Coke]: ref the pod code link you gave above, do you think the nqp bits in the associated rakumod files can be used safely in public modules?

[12:37] <tbrowder> the precompile and cache bits

[14:05] <tbrowder> [Coke]:lizmatref RakuAST pod handling: pod is still recursively complex, but better parsing capability should help my needs.

[16:38] <tbrowder> pls tell me again where to find how to use RakuAST in the latest version of Rakudo. i know it's around somewhere but i can't find it at raku.org or rakudo.org. thnx

[16:39] <tbrowder> i think it's an env var...

[16:43] <tbrowder> [Coke]: i know you told me earlier, and i'm using it, but where is it posted onllne?

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> It’s private?

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not see it too — even restated Discord to make it appear.
