[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/ ... just noticed some comments coming in from raely used Discord channels (in this case OTHER/other-programming) and realised that we are spread too thinkly channel wise

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> can I suggest we prune all the quiet Discord channels? that way it will look like there are more of use ;-)

[16:53] <teatime> do all the discord channels have an irc channel

[16:53] <teatime> I don't really use the discord but I was kinda overwhelmed by the number of channels there, it gave me FOMO

[16:54] <teatime> of course I'm not even in all the irc channels

[17:02] <teatime> I have a family of hawks that live in the woods around my yard.  they were a welcome topic of conversation.  however we just put chicken wire around the pickets of the deck outside so we could let our new dog out onto it, and the hawk circles some then made a low pass.  my dad being out there probably prevented her death.  dog isn't going to get much bigger, so maybe she can't ever go out there :/

[17:03] <teatime> sorry wrong window

[18:21] <ab5tract> teatime: if there are an overwhelming number of channels on discord than I doubt there is an irc for each one..

[18:22] <ab5tract> You’ve got me wondering what I might be missing

[18:24] <teatime> oh no, you caught my FOMO

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> lizmat - thanks for putting some additional attention on my wishful problem-solving issue

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> teatime - if it eases your FOMO, I've removed several that were more or less inactive... the vast majority of discussion does happen on the IRC-linked channels

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> there is a non-linked raku questions channel for posting big code snippets that might annoy folks in IRC

[20:31] <teatime> cool, good to know thanks

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> irc bridges only IRC_BRIDGES/raku-irc and IRC_BRIDGES/webring-irc (whatever that is)

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @roguerakudev - thanks!

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> teatime: we have kites (aka hawks) that are pretty big ... they did some swoops on my dog when a puppy - but they always wimped out - maybe your hawks are less wary or hungirer though - I saw one swoop on our cat and thought she's a goner - but then the kite just grabbed a small piece of chicken next to the cat ... was there any dog food  (esp meat) nearby

[21:56] <teatime> nah it was 100 percent after the dog but it's possible it once it got a close look at it it realized it was too large

[21:56] <teatime> it posted up in a tree afterward and continued to watch, well, like a hawk.

[22:00] <teatime> librasteve: so the two raku-beginner channels aren't bridged?

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I believe they are

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I just don't have raku-beginner categorized under bridges since initally I didn't realize there was an equivalent IRC channel
