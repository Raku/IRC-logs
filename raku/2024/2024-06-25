[18:21] <[Coke]> Anyone using LibraryMake for their modules?

[18:35] <guifa> super random, if I've got a variable, how can I get its type constraint? basically such that my %foo; %foo.[...].something ---> Associative

[18:36] <guifa> I thought it was going to be .VAR.of but that seems to only work for containerized vars

[18:56] *** abraxxa-home joined
[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa I am not sure, but I think because of similar considerations / wants I made "Data::TypeSystem", which has deduce-type.

[19:02] <guifa> If I do %foo := Stash.new; I'd imagine deduce-type might get Stash instead of Hash?

[19:02] <guifa> err

[19:03] <guifa> rather not Hash, Associative

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes. But it is a custom label ('Assoc').

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, not a label (string) but a class:  Data::TypeSystem::Assoc .

[19:06] *** guifa left
[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have to try it -- I might be lying to you. (I will try after â‰ˆ3 hours.)
