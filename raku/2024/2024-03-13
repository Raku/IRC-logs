[07:47] <melezhik> hi

[07:47] <melezhik> can I handle process signal inside raku code?

[07:47] <melezhik> I need to handle sigterm signal

[07:49] <melezhik> found this - https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Handle_a_signal#Raku

[07:59] <snonux> hey, i noticed that Rakudo doesn't support private multi methods yet. not a major blocker for me, but i stumbled on this on a few occasions. does anyone know whether it is planned for the future?

[09:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @snonux What a strange feature request!!

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To paraphrase : > If You've Got Nothing to Hide, You've Got Nothing to Fear  What do you fear of, so you want to hide your multi methods?

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Do you want to hide all of the variants of a multi-method or just some of them?

[15:41] <tbrowder> lizmat: the raku-community-modules page could use some pinned-modules mgmt. it's not using the full 6 normally allowed. and the pinned ones should reflect something like popularity or most wanted improvements

[16:16] <[Coke]> is there a URL I can hit to see what the latest released version is?

[16:17] <[Coke]> (I want the doc tests to be using the latest released version, so I want an author test to complain if not.)

[18:27] <snonux> antononcube: i always aim to keep all class members and methods private by default (encapsulation)

[18:28] <snonux> antononcube: usually, all of them or none of them (multi methods) to be private. i never encountered a case where i want to have a mix of the same method name (private + public)

[18:33] <[Coke]> I think if I had something like that, I'd have the private be a different name to avoid confusion

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> is there some nice syntax sugar for multi dispatch where one candidate wants a named Bool to be True and another will take it as False (or missing)?

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> e.g. tell :loudly would hit the first candidate and  tell or tell :!loudly would hit the second

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo I have further questions on "Marrow".

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> ok

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> More precisely, on the envisioned changes of the generated code.

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> How so?

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... it is hard to explain without a visual...

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a role that has the bulding method:      submethod BUILD(:$id) {         try {             $db = self.get-db-handle();             for $db.query( 

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Am I correct to think that that role is not supposed to be changed, but the class that does is?

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Correct

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> With "changed" I mean adding new functionalities, etc.

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> yes

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You either mentioned it yesterday here, or it was written in the documentation.

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> hopefully both

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ Mmm.. I think only the former...

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> It would be in the section of the Read.me that has the directory tree

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> or maybe not

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Usage:   ./bin/mro.raku [--app] [--mods] [--roles] [--templates] [--list] [--db-type=<Str>] [--dbname=<Str>] [--host=<Str>] [--port=<Str>] [--user=<Str>] [--password=<Str>] [--schema=<Str>] [--prefix=<Str>] [--app-host=<Str>] [--app-port=<Str>] [--help]        --app               Generate the Cro app that implements the REST APIs. [default: False]     --mods              Generate empty Class modules that can be

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> modified by users (one to implement each role). [default: False]

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Similarly, I should not add new routes in "public-routes.rakumod" -- but in the higher leverl "*-routes.rakumod", right?

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> in the usage

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> correct

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is "cryptic" then.

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I can spell it out better

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo If you use LLMs you might use the interaction here to enhance that documentation.

[22:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo I still mildly impressed that you published "Marrow" just a few weeks before I "really" needed it!

[22:40] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I aim to please

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hahah -- dangerous statement!

[22:50] <[Coke]> go to install a module of mine I haven't used in a while via zef, it dies. open a ticket with the test bug, clone my repo... I already fixed this and never cut a release.
