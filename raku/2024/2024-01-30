[10:12] <k3ut0i> Thanks :) that precedence drop was bugging me, as I was using  : for only single argument methods.

[17:34] <tellable6> 2024-01-29T10:02:01Z #raku <ab5tract> Xliff: how you find all these corner cases amazes me :)

[17:38] <Xliff> .tell ab5stract That's because I am a corner case! In this insance, the problem existed between the chair and the keyboard. Someone really needs to fix that! :D

[17:38] <tellable6> Xliff, I haven't seen ab5stract around, did you mean ab5tract?

[17:38] <Xliff> .tell ab5tract That's because I am a corner case! In this insance, the problem existed between the chair and the keyboard. Someone really needs to fix that! :D

[17:38] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to ab5tract

[17:41] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/raku-GData

[17:42] <Xliff> Right now there is a very basic Youtube API.

[17:42] <Xliff> Google documents coming soon.

[17:43] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/raku-GData/blob/main/examples/youtube-query.e

[17:44] <Xliff> Yeah, I know there is an exposed API key. I'll kill it in a couple of days or so... feel free to play with it. Bug reports will be appreciated!

[17:44] <Xliff> Actually, it's not even fit for use in anything other than Ubuntu, for now.

[17:44] <Xliff> If someone wants to play with it in another distro, I'll need the name of your libgdata

[18:35] <[Coke]> Xliff: I tried but since there's no meta6.json, not easy to find libs/deps

[18:37] <[Coke]> (raku -Ilib examples/youtube-query.e starts to compile /GData/Raw/Types.pm6 which then complains about not finding Exports)

[19:30] <Xliff> No.

[19:30] <Xliff> GData has its own authentication system.

[19:30] <Xliff> [Coke] - I have yet to get it ready for use. Hopefully sometime later tonight.

[19:54] <[Coke]> ok, happy to give it a shot here.

[19:57] <[Coke]> anyone know if there's a tool that would let me render an SVG and pick *some* curves out of it? I want to try to decompose camelia into some component shapes for 3d printing so I can more easily do colored parts and snap them in (instead of trying to do a six color print)
