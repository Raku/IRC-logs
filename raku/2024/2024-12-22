[08:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke I should have clarified: I consider making a Raku interface package for a C-package that is with AGPL3. In this kind of interfacing I prefer making the interface package to have the same license as the core package.

[08:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Obviously, it is not a principle necessary to follow.

[09:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the C-package I am looking at: https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/SISL

[13:44] <xinming> how do we bisect the commit which fixed the above line?

[13:44] <xinming> I mean with channel bots.   just found that 2024.08 has this bug, But .12 version fixes it.

[13:45] <ab5tract> bisectable6: help

[13:45] <bisectable6> ab5tract, Like this: bisectable6: old=2015.12 new=HEAD exit 1 if (^∞).grep({ last })[5] // 0 == 4 # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/wiki/Bisectable

[13:49] <xinming> bisectable6: old=2024.08 new=2024.12  my @x = <a b>; "ag" ~~ /^ (@x) /; $0.say;

[13:49] <bisectable6> xinming, Bisecting by exit code (old=2024.08 new=2024.12). Old exit code: 1

[13:49] <bisectable6> xinming, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/e17ec670fb7553e260342857edd6cc62

[19:51] <ab5tract> xinming: it’s also worth noting that all these bots hang out in #whateverable , so if you ever have a lot of questions or just want to avoid the feeling of spamming #raku, you can always chat with them there as well
