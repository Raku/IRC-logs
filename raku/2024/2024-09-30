[11:40] <timo> gotta give Terminal::UI a look

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I just read its README.

[11:44] <timo> i wonder how hard it would be to make fzf embeddable into a pane of Terminal::UI

[12:04] *** jjido left
[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I wonder how to make an LLM-conversational agent via "Terminal::UI".

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So far I do that via Cro. It was in my TODO list since at least a year to figure out a terminal solution...

[12:13] <timo> could always go through an ipython commandline + raku jupyter kernel

[12:13] *** jjido joined
[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... yeah -- for some clients I do a special Jupyter notebook/kernel that has "immediate" chat cells for a certain (predetermined) conversational agent.

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo This is your GitHub, right? https://github.com/timo

[12:23] <timo> yeah i have "timo" on github :)

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is for acknowledgement purposes.

[12:34] <timo> don't take this the wrong way, but i feel a little uncomfortable having my name connected to anything involving LLMs

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is not about LLMs: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Math-SparseMatrix

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @timo See the "Acknowledgments" section. I can remove the reference to your handle/repository if you want.

[12:45] <timo> huh, i don't remember helping with that

[12:45] <timo> i mean the postcircumfix issue

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Damn! I might have confused you with "tonyo". üòÖ

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh -- confirmed.

[13:02] <timo> that explains some things :)

[13:22] *** tjr left
[13:23] <xinming> What's the perldoc in raku please? No rakudoc, IIRC, there is p6doc

[13:23] <xinming> But the command not exist it seems.

[13:23] <xinming> I mean, a command to read the module doc

[13:25] *** tjr joined
[13:25] <xinming> hmm, searched raku.land, rakudoc seems to be the thing.

[13:30] <[Coke]> rakudo was the original attempt at giving something like 'perldoc' - it works with raku/doc but you have to do some setup

[13:39] <timo> the rakudo --doc flag also exists, though i'm not sure it's what you want

[13:42] *** tjr left
[13:43] <[Coke]> xinming: was going to point you to the docs, but instead opened https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc/issues/30

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo "[...] i feel a little uncomfortable having my name connected to anything involving LLMs" -- I will be very interested to hear why and how come!

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, feel free not to respond on that request.

[13:58] <timo> just the usual reasons you've probably heard a thousand times already

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here, by Grock: Here's a concise summary of each point:  1. Privacy: Fear of data misuse by LLMs. 2. Misrepresentation: Worries about incorrect use of identity. 3. Ethics: Opposition to AI's ethical implications. 4. Security: Risks like phishing or identity theft. 5. Identity: Losing control over digital persona. 6. Unpredictability: Unforeseen AI outputs using their name. 7. Beliefs: Cultural or

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> religious objections to AI use. 8. Stigma: Negative perceptions from AI associations. 9. Legal: Concerns over legal rights and liabilities. 10. Branding: AI association might harm personal brand. 11. Misinformation: Name linked to potential false content. 12. Novelty: Discomfort with new, rapidly advancing tech.

[14:41] <tbrowder> ref rakudoc and V2, i believe the new rakudoc will still recognize old pod6 (i.e., it's supposed to be backwards compatible), is that True?

[14:42] <lizmat> yes, although rakudoc may not reproduce all bugs in pod

[14:42] <lizmat> e.g. virtual table handling is more strict

[14:43] <tbrowder> if so, mi6 will not HAVE to be updated for the person who worried about it on one of the channels

[14:44] <[Coke]> the raku/doc site has a test to verify that rendering between the two is comparable - not exhaustive, but a good size corpus with different features to test on

[14:44] <tbrowder> also, i can attest to the new RakuAST parser catching an old pod bug

[14:44] <tbrowder> üëè

[14:45] <tbrowder> of mine

[14:45] <[Coke]> Yes, most of the differences in raku/doc were that, new processor working, old one bugged.

[14:45] <[Coke]> I wonder if we should rename raku/rakudoc to raku/rakudoc-cli

[14:45] <[Coke]> or App::rakudoc, actually.

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <bscan> In the Raku language server, it uses a custom rakudoc parser written in typescript to show module documentation on hover. Although I wonder if that should be updated to use rakudoc instead.

[15:04] <tbrowder> probably ought to check with finanalyst--i'm not sure how all the pieces are supposed to fit together

[15:05] <tbrowder> in the main scheme of things

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See the last section -- it is about, $smat[*;1..2] , etc., when $smat is a sparse matrix.

[17:13] <tonyo> i mean about the quote, i feel a little uncomfortable having my name connected to anything involving LLMs

[17:13] <tonyo> my guess is because i just know very little about ai

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo I am sorry -- again I confused "timo" with "tonyo". (This time the other way around.)

[17:17] <tonyo> ++

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That quote was from "timo". I am trusting the autocompletion of names too much...
