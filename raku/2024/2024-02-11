[01:28] <SmokeMachine> I just learned about Apple's Pkl... and it seems Pkl have the same intent as Configuration, but Configuration is raku specific...

[12:19] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: it does the round in hipster land :)

[12:19] <El_Che> I find it as ugly as json for configuration. The only interesting bit is the templating, imho

[12:26] *** jpn joined
[12:31] <El_Che> the neat thing is that is has schema validation

[12:31] <El_Che> but that yells xml :)

[14:15] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: whatâ€™s all that ugly? Pkl or Configuration?

[14:15] <El_Che> pkl

[14:16] <El_Che> it looks like weird json

[14:16] <El_Che> s/:/=/g

[14:16] *** vlad joined
[14:19] <El_Che> it all depends what you want to do with it. It's just for configuration, then https://xkcd.com/927/

[14:19] <El_Che> if it's for templating and validation, then it's something else

[14:26] <El_Che> at work we have some people that thoght that toml was the solution, so now we have yaml, json, properties, xml and toml :)

[14:27] *** dakkar left
[14:34] <El_Che> and I am pretty sure we'll very soon have pkl :)

[14:35] <El_Che> we have a use case where the templating is useful to replace the more freestyle toml

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine I have not "abandoned" the study of "Configuration" -- it is just hard for me to come to any conclusions.

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine In relation to what @El_Che says -- I am looking for reasons to use Raku-based configurations instead of, say, JSON. I assume that Raku-based configurations might benefit the configurations I do for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Finite State Machines (FSMs).

[14:50] <El_Che> we have a full configuration management conference here in .be, just after Fosdem :)

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, you can all go config yourselves?! (After FOSDEM.)

[14:52] <El_Che> of course is the context somewhat different (config *management*), but you see the hypes and holy wars there as well :)

[14:52] <El_Che> antononcube: just be carefull not to reinvent the wheel.

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think that XKCD post/cartoon -- 927 -- is one of the most quoted ones.

[14:54] <El_Che> with good reason

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @El_Che I a couple questions that might seem to random.

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 1. Do you use Jupyter notebooks (with kernels for Raku, Python, or other.)

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 2. What graphics library do you use in Raku, if at all?

[14:55] <El_Che> 1. No 2. None

[14:56] <El_Che> not the kind of stuff I mostly right (networking, security, API microservices, etc)

[14:56] <El_Che> I have use Raku, but only in non-critical services (speed, uptime)

[14:57] <El_Che> used

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @El_Che Damn!! I was starting to consider making a Raku package for XKCD-style-conversions of graphics.

[14:58] <El_Che> (a service can be important, but not critical e.g. not time dependant)

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @El_Che Good -- you should LLMs with Raku then. (Back to my cross-sell and up-sell of LLMs and Jupyter...)

[14:58] <El_Che> one can always invent a reason to learn something

[14:59] <El_Che> I have 2 colleagues imperimenting with it that keep me posted

[14:59] <El_Che> experimenting

[14:59] <El_Che> so it's possible something useful can be extracted for a poc project

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I plan to start a series of posts today titled "LLM fails".

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The first one is titled "Making wrong calendars with LLMs".

[15:00] <El_Che> I got a mail I just got accessed to MS paying chatgpt thingy

[15:00] <El_Che> probably the chat in edge when authenticated

[15:01] <El_Che> need to look if there is some api access

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmmm... interesting!

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> API of what? MicroSofts Edge?

[15:01] <El_Che> chatgpt

[15:02] <El_Che> 4

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There are several Raku packages for LLMs access.

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But you might have something else in mind...

[15:03] <El_Che> MS is a b*tch regarding access, including paying. They have several competing products

[15:03] <El_Che> need to check what access I have 

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... Same with Google, BTW. The just changed/renamed their LLM service. It only vaguly clear to me which of the three-four LLM service Google provides should I use and when.

[15:04] <El_Che> sounds familiar

[15:05] <El_Che> there is de github one, the one with office free, office paying, office paying more , etc etc

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right. At least they did not just "killed it." https://gcemetery.co

[15:06] <El_Che> yeah, google has bitten me before

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is how XKCDConvert looks / functions in Mathematica: https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/XKCDConvert/

[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i have an interesting question for you guys: have you ever used clojure, f#, elixir, haskell etc?

[20:19] <lizmat> many of the pugs people were fluent in Haskell...  but not many are around here anymore

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @arun Here is what I think about each of those: ðŸ¤®, ðŸ¤®, ðŸ¤®, ðŸ¤®.

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And yes, I tried them...

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, I have not tried Elixir -- I read "Erlang", for some reason. But vomiting over "elixir" is hard to resist...

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> arun: there was a time early in the raku (back then was perl6) project that all contributors were encouraged to try Haskell first and my impression is that a lot of the Haskell DNA made it into raku (in a diluted way) and the migration guide shows how https://docs.raku.org/language/haskell-to-p6

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (as lizmat points out the first implementation of raku grammar (called 'pugs') was written in Haskell

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> )

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there are a couple of good posts on this topic (i) https://raku-advent.blog/2019/12/19/day-19-functional-programming-with-raku/,  (ii) https://dev.to/rawleyfowler/functional-programming-with-raku-9ib

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if you go to https;?/raku.land and type 'value' into the search box, you will see a selection of ValueType modules (ValueList, ValueMap and so on) which provide immutable variants of the built in raku data structures (and can be used for custom classes iiuc)

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I think that there are two schools of thought with languages in general - (i) I want the language to cajole me to code in a certain way (memory safe, type safe, no side-effects...) where the daily task is to fight the compiler and (ii) I want the language to be a bag of tools that I can use the way I want to get the job done. Raku lets you do functional (or imperative, or concurrent, or OO) if you wish. If (i) is what you want from

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> your language then raku is likely not strict enough for you. Otherwise, it has 90% of what you need and all the other goodies.

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also this chapter of the Think Raku book https://greenteapress.com/thinkperl6/html/thinkperl6015.html#sec272 (perl == perl6 in this book)

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and, finally, I offer this (written about perl5 in 2005) ... to illustrate that perl5 has long had functional roots https://perl.plover.com/yak/fp/ upon which raku has built
