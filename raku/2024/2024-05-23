[09:29] <wayland76> Hi all!  I've had a look through https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/Raku/Grammar.nqp and couldn't find any reference to the "redo" function.  That means I'm looking in the wrong place.  Where do we keep the official grammar for Raku?

[10:02] <lizmat> wayland76: "redo" is implemented as a sub, so you won't find it in any grammar other than as <identifier> in locations where a sub call would be valid

[10:03] <lizmat> the implementation of redo can be found at: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/control.rakumod#L114-L116

[10:04] <lizmat> the documentation here: https://docs.raku.org/language/control#redo

[10:15] <tbrowder> ugexe: would it be helpful to make an option for zef to search only for distro names so we can help root out needed fixes?

[10:16] <tbrowder> zef list --distros ...

[10:22] <tbrowder> and i think using App::Mi6 prevents the problem on the author's end

[10:23] *** thaewrapt joined
[10:24] <tbrowder> my mi6-helper lint option should also help

[11:02] <wayland76> lizmat: Great, thanks!  :) 

[11:04] <wayland76> Is this a bug: https://gist.github.com/wayland/a5209aab36925c78f27cf2dae2d39d74 ?

[11:04] <wayland76> Shouldn't answer 5 be 84?  

[11:05] <wayland76> (Documentation at https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#The_let_prefix )

[11:05] <wayland76> No, my bad.  

[11:06] <wayland76> When I return Nil instead of False, answer 5 becomes 84.  

[11:30] <wayland76> I *did* find a doco bug though -- https://docs.raku.org/type/X/Control refers to CX::Oops, but then goes on to define CX::Vaya instead

[11:43] <lizmat> wayland76: https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/new?assignees=&labels=docs&projects=&template=bug-report-or-feature-request.md&title=  :-)

[16:02] <Voldenet> [Coke]: I did some refactoring for the code to make sense (it used to serve <html><body> for every line) http://0x0.st/XZbu.txt

[16:02] <Voldenet> while it's not a complete http server, it does work

[16:02] <Voldenet> on firefox at least

[16:05] <[Coke]> Voldenet++ a PR would make it very easy for me to accept that!

[17:21] <[Coke]> apparently this used to work but now requires you pass an explict Str

[17:21] <[Coke]> ... (explicit Str works in my sample, but not in raku/doc xt/check-signatures.t)

[22:27] <[Coke]> Here's another coding thing that would help: https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4471 - the code for raku/doc to check signatures in the docs against the rakudo source doesn't realize that a "has $.proc" means that you can call a method ".proc" on that thing, so it complains.

[22:27] <[Coke]> If someone wants to hack on that, please join us in #raku-doc with any questions.
