[01:08] <tbrowder__> i can't see my msg, but i'm trying to dynamically load a module per the example in the docs but i'm getting a failure. hints welcome

[01:33] <Voldenet> the output is somewhat‚Ä¶ weird

[01:33] <SmokeMachine> Yes‚Ä¶ very odd‚Ä¶ just noticed

[01:33] <Voldenet> doesn't classify guarantee order?

[01:34] *** oodani left
[01:34] <Voldenet> Ah, that's because classify is implemented with hash

[01:34] *** oodani joined
[01:34] <Voldenet> so obviously it doesn't

[02:00] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: Odd. That does work, but it loses points for hash disorder! :)
