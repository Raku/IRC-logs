[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Which is better?  rule list {   '(' [ <item> ',' ]* <item> ')' } or   rule list {   '(' <item> [ ',' <item> ]* ')' } 

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> %% or % :-)

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> That went right over my head üôÇ

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In this particular case the parenthesiized expression is short, so using ‚Äô(‚Äò ~ ‚Äò)‚Äô ‚Ä¶ does not make the rule definition more readable. (To me at least.)

[18:05] <coleman> docs.raku.org sent me an alert. I'm checking on it.

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Interesting. To me the '(' ~ ')' ‚Ä¶ one is much more readable.

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> One reads as "An opening parenthesis, followed by an <item>, followed by a block that holds a comma followed by an item, block that can appear zero or more times, followed by a closing parenthesis."

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> And the other one as "A parenthesized expression holding one or more items joined with commas."

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Of course it only takes a short moment to see that the first one means the same as the second one, but hey, we've got a nice mechanism to express it more simply üôÇ

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I had never seen that notation before. If @vendethiel hadn't said it was the same thing it would have taken me a while to figure out

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Oh, the meaning is not obvious, but once learned, it kind of is.

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Outside of readibility, it helps with error messages

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Certainly there are some things I‚Äôve forgotten but I‚Äôve been a Raku user for more than a decade :-)

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I've been using Raku for a while too, and that feature, I knew it existed, but would probably have had to look up the exact syntax (if I had thought of using it instead of the original formulation).

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Raku is a pretty big language üôÇ

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vendethiel Hmm‚Ä¶ how so? The syntax implies some sort of an universal error message?

[19:09] <Xliff> I think I know the answer already, but is there any way to use the '$' as a prefix operator?

[19:12] <Xliff> m: multi sub prefix:<Ôπ©> (Numeric $v) { say "BOO!"; $v + 3 }; say Ôπ©4

[19:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9d959fae4: OUTPUT: ¬´BOO!‚ê§7‚ê§¬ª

[19:12] <Xliff> \o/

[19:12] <Xliff> God bless unicode.

[19:12] *** vrurg left
[19:17] <lizmat> .oO( may all your dollar prefixes be small )

[19:20] <Xliff> lizmat: '$' is never allowed. Most of the unicode alternatives just aren't as appealing.

[19:20] <lizmat> yeah, that would slow down parsing significantly if we made $ overrideable

[19:20] <Xliff> Figured as much. 

[19:21] <Xliff> I can do this though....

[19:21] <Xliff> m: multi sub prefix:<$$> (Numeric $b) { say "BOO!"; $b }; my $a = $$14 + 2; $a.say

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9d959fae4: OUTPUT: ¬´BOO!‚ê§16‚ê§¬ª

[19:21] <Xliff> Can't have any alphas in that one, though.

[19:22] <Xliff> m: multi sub prefix:<Z$> (Numeric $b) { say "ZIMBABWE!"; $b }; my $a = Z$14 + 2; $a.say

[19:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9d959fae4: OUTPUT: ¬´ZIMBABWE!‚ê§16‚ê§¬ª

[19:22] <Xliff> I'm thinking about writing a module for currency symbols. 

[19:23] <Xliff> The pieces are all assembled. I just have a few other questions I want to answer.

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff A certain Raku new-comer proclaimed ideas and the making of a similar package recently.

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That was a few months ago. As I recall from reviewing the code, his package covered lots of bases.
