[11:14] <frost> I think there is a bug in the REPL, `[0] > my @a=[^120]; @a.map(<-> $a { $a++ }); [1] > say @a[101]; say @a[102]`, the result is `"102\n102"`

[11:15] <frost> Put them on one line fixs the problem

[11:19] <frost> BTW, why dose `@a.map(<-> $a is rw { $a++ })` not change values of @a? when `<->` and `is rw` are together, the side effects disappear

[11:20] <lizmat> that last thing feels like a bug

[13:20] <Voldenet> for me it doesn't feel like a bug, it's exactly what I'd expect from .map with side-effects

[13:21] <Voldenet> which is pure nonsense

[13:22] <Voldenet> fwiw ` @a.map(<-> $a { $a++ }).eager` does an expected thing

[13:23] <Xliff> How can I tell if a command executed via qqx<> completed successfully?

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think recently there was a discussion about "HummingBirds" performance "web service wise." Is there similar discussion and / or benchmarks about "Cro" ?

[20:17] <ptc> tbrowder: one is a dependency of Selenium::WebDriver and was written by the same author; that particular version of File::Zip uses `unzip` to extract archives whereas the other File::Zip uses `extract` IIRC.

[20:17] <ptc> tbrowder: I don't know if both authors are still available; it's sort of hard to tell :-/

[20:18] <ptc> tbrowder: either way, I wanted to get Selenium::WebDriver to work and for that I needed one particular File::Zip and it didn't seem possible

[20:19] <ptc> tbrowder: ugexe gave a great tip in his answer to my issue on GitHub and basically mentioned that `zef install File::Zip:ver<0>` would also do the trick (`*` gets treated as being effectively 0) and yes, that works :-)
