[11:53] <tbrowder> [Coke]: yeah, the encoding thing didn't work, something else is amiss. windows is a strange beast. i remember three main weirdisms when i first heared agout windows: spaces in file names, noncase-sensitive file system, and \ instead of / for directory separation. ugh, "root of all evel"

[11:53] <tbrowder> *evil

[11:54] <tbrowder> i think it's a miracle raku (and perl) will even run at all on windows!

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, go vote please.

[13:35] <ugexe> the latest version of windows is supported fine

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am using NativeCall  for the implementation of "Math::DistanceFunctions::Edit". After installation that package and package that depend on it work fine, but if I log-out and log-in of my computer and try to run Raku packages that use "Math::DistanceFunctions::Edit" I get messages like :   Cannot locate native library

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What would be the problem?

[13:40] <ugexe> some module is stringifying %?RESOURCES<...> probably

[13:41] <ugexe> i.e. using `is native(%?RESOURCES<foo>.Str)` instead of `is native(%?RESOURCES<foo>)`

[13:43] <ugexe> https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Math-DistanceFunctions-Edit/blob/616f71de9446af88dd08462d99a3ed32047ff1a4/lib/Math/DistanceFunctions/Edit.rakumod#L8

[13:43] <ugexe> change to `my constant $library = %?RESOURCES<libraries/EditDistance>;`

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugeexe Thank you! I just noticed that I am stringifying %?RESOURCES<libraries/EditDistance> and B.Duggan does not in his C-based packages, and dismissed it as the reason.

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugexe Could I have figured out the stringyfication problem by reading the NativeCall documentation? (Well, at this point I just "browsed" it...)

[13:54] <tbrowder> ugexe: sorry for the bad issue report--i misread the workflows log.

[14:03] <ugexe> antoncube: im not sure, but the idea is more general than that. i imagine most people dont really intend to have a path saved to a compile time variable, because the path might change for whatever reason in the future

[14:04] <ugexe> there is also a rakudo warning if you call stringification methods on a %?RESOURCES directly, but you wouldnt see those since you first called .IO on it (which unfortunately side-steps the warning for stringification)

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ugexe Thanks -- very interesting, useful...
