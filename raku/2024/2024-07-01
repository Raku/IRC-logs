[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> This is the full playlist for the conference and they have managed to get 23 videos out there.

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> But most of them are perl not Raku

[16:31] <lizmat> and only one has Raku content, or am I wrong?

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat On that playlist, or the confernce in general?

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I think you may be right. Though Damien and Ovid mention Raku in their videos.

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think conference-wise there should be at least 4 Raku talks.

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I definitely plan to make Raku's "Graph" better than Perl's "Graph".

[19:28] <Xliff> How can I pun a role on a class AFTER its definition?

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Only the Raku ones or all?

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also

[19:29] <Xliff> Only Raku

[19:29] <Xliff> librasteve: also is inside a class def. I need it AFTER the class def.

[19:30] <Xliff> does will not work as an operator on a Type object. 'but' might work, but I'd need to use another container.

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am happy to help with a raku-only conference - my question is 'all' (but raku ones is also interesting)

[19:30] <tonyo> what are you trying to do?

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I was commenting on @librasteve 's question about how many attendees were at TRPC 2024.

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: maybe you can just reopen the class later?

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I think / thought but is used  for that.

[19:31] <Xliff> class definitions don't work like that I don't think.

[19:31] <Xliff> but is used as an assignment

[19:32] <Xliff> m: role R { }; class A { }; constant C = A but R; A.say; C.say

[19:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7190eae29: OUTPUT: ¬´(A)‚ê§(A+{R})‚ê§¬ª

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_but

[19:38] <lizmat> librasteve gotcha: and yes, I was unpleasantly surprised by Damian's presentation

[19:38] <lizmat> couldn't bring myself to watch the whole 1.5 hours, stopped after 30 mins or so

[19:38] <lizmat> is there something I should watch?

[19:39] <lizmat> in that presentation, I mean?

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Should I make a LLM summary of it?

[19:39] <lizmat> antononcube perhaps?

[19:39] <tonyo> what did he say?

[19:40] <lizmat> it's more about what he did: adding more modules to port Raku features into Perl

[19:42] <lizmat> https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch::Back

[19:42] <lizmat> https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch::Right

[19:43] <lizmat> https://metacpan.org/pod/Multi::Dispatch

[19:44] <Xliff> lizmat: How can you pun a role on a class after its definition?

[19:44] <lizmat> does?

[19:45] <Xliff> does will not work on a Type Constant.

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I will do it the LLM summary within 20 min. This presentation, right? https://youtu.be/0x9LD8oOmv0

[19:46] <Xliff> Can't use but without a container to put it in, but I really shouldn't need that since this should be attached to the class at definition time but couldn't due to a circularity.

[19:46] <lizmat> antononcube yup

[19:47] <lizmat> m: class A { }; role R { method foo() { "foo" } }; say (A but R).foo

[19:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7190eae29: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hm... with Gemini or ChatGPT ü§î

[19:47] <lizmat> antononcube I have no preference

[19:48] <lizmat> Xliff: you can only augment an existing class, and you probably shouldn't

[19:48] <lizmat> you can mixin a role into a class to create a new class?

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, one is free for me, the other one not so much. üôÇ It is way to attach imprtance of to that talk...

It highlights key module creations, explores the impact of AI on programming, and delves into the potential of multiple dispatch, particularly for features like smart matching.

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I will upload the LLM breakdown to GitHub soon (within 20 min.)

[20:03] <lizmat> yeah, that's about the fist I got  :-(

[20:03] <lizmat> and not a word of Raku in it, only the "future of Perl"

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Raku" is mentioned 10 times in the transcript.

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That LLM theme extraction was with Gemini -- I will rerun the script with ChatGPT.

[20:05] <lizmat> well, I guess that's once every 9 minutes

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh, It is/was more clustered than that.

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> I listen to most of them at 1.25x to 1.5x speed.

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Bruce Gray (Grey?)'s Raku Operators talk was interesting. I didn't realize that Raku created Meta operators automatically if a new op is created.

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> They might be more informative or of interest to people who know Perl.

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> 23:00]librasteve: he says something like "perl tried to backport the raku given/when (which I wrote), has now ejected that by deprecating switch from 5.42 in 2025 and here is my new module Switch::Back that I have corrected all the errors I wrote in given/when 15 years ago" wtf

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (you probably just have to watch it - and Ovid)

[21:36] <patrickb> [Coke]: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-LineEditor/pull/6 <-- This should solve your install problems with Terminal::LineEditor.

[21:37] <patrickb> [Coke]: https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/pull/85 <-- And this should solve your problem with running the Terminal::Widgets examples.

[21:47] <ingy> librasteve: 85 iirc

[21:51] <ingy> imho tprc could have been raku heavy. it's whomever submits talks / shows up.

[21:52] <ingy> we had to extend the deadline to even get enough talks this year.

[21:54] <ingy> I can't speak to what damian does. His choice. But I can say 100% there is no bent against raku at tprc.

[21:56] <ingy> Bruce (and Sarah) are on the tprc planning committee. Am I wrong, Bruce?
