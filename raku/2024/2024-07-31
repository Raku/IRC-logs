[11:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaay - so we know that the errant page is blank on both sites http://cro.services/docs/intro/spa-with-cro and http://cro.raku.org/docs/intro/spa-with-cro I have taken a look at the GH croservices repo https://github.com/croservices/cro-website/tree/master/docs ... and human eyeball mark 1 says all looks fine ... so the next thing I would do is to rebuild the site(s) ... anyone know how to do this?

[11:32] <lizmat> coleman andinus would be able to do that, I think

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> coleman: please can you rebuild the cro website?

[11:34] *** librasteve_ joined
[11:34] <tbrowder> btw, regarding utf8-c8, as i read the docs it looks like i should be able to roundtrip most any file (including ascii and numbers and pdf) by doing the slurp and spurt as shown above--testing that soday

[11:35] <librasteve_> coleman: please can you rebuild the cro website?

[11:36] <lizmat> tbrowder: afaik, there are *some* bad byte sequences that do not round-trip in utf8-c8

[11:36] <lizmat> but not many

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It looks like that my favorite visualization-in-Raku pipeline with JavaScript's D3.js cannot do 3D graphics. Anyone here having experiences with JavaScript libraries for 3D graphics. (Please, share!)

[13:30] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2024.07 is out (thx liz)

[13:30] <tellable6> 2024-07-25T20:01:10Z #raku-dev <jdv> El_Che the 2024.07 release is done

[13:42] <coleman> opened issue on the cro website repo https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/issues/3

[13:46] <coleman> The dockerfile is pretty simple to build if you want to try updating the Cro website. otherwise I will take a look this weekend. Busy for a couple of days üòû https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/blob/main/Dockerfile

[17:04] <tbrowder> lizmat: of the mixed bag of 10 text , font, pdf files i finally got my converter working and only 2 files were reported by gnu bin to ‚Äúfail‚Äù. it was a font file created by an individual fontographer and the pdf file reported was using it.

[17:06] <tbrowder> would it be useful to list the bad chunks in  the docs? i vote üëç

[17:06] <lizmat> yes, or at least in a Rakudo issue

[17:06] <lizmat> afk&

[17:09] <tbrowder> gnu cmp that id

[17:09] <tbrowder> is

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okay, twas four backticks in an .md file have submitted a PR

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> til that Cro (and the cro-website pattern) is a great way to write a website in markdown

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What do you mean? ‚ÄúCro‚Äù lets you specify a website with a Markdown document?

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/blob/d2d4fb466890966980dd7f8c3b091186c70ded18/lib/Routes.pm6#L73

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this does the work - look in the eg docs/intro dir and you will just see .md

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> compare to the web pages - magic

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Interesting.

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is "Cro' acting as a "template processor" or "template engine"?

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well I suppose you could take that Routes.pm6 file and formalize to something - likely would need jnthn to tell us the answer
