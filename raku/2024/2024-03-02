[00:09] <[Coke]> if any of your code is using NativeCall, then that's probably it.

[00:10] <[Coke]> if it's *pure* raku, you should be able to generate a core dump and get a c-level stack trace (you might need to build a raku with debug)

[00:10] <[Coke]> do you have a small amount (or at least reproducible) bit of code that does it?

[00:47] <tbrowder__> ah, that may be it. but i have bypassed whatever the problem was, at least for now. thanks for the hint.

[03:43] <SmokeMachine> Now HTML::Component can generate form based on the endpoint and have options to what to do in case of error... https://github.com/FCO/HTML-Component/tree/main/examples/users Any idea/suggestion?

[21:18] <Xliff> \o

[21:18] * Xliff just wrote a Teleprompter with Raku and p6-GtkPlus

[21:19] <Xliff> And then I broke it again adding features.

[21:19] <Xliff> Clocks in at 105 lines minus the Lorem Ipsum demo content.

[21:19] <japhb> Doh!  Feature breaking is my bane.

[21:19] <Xliff> I'd need to release Pango, GDK, GtkPlus to release the Teleprompter

[21:20] <japhb> (Adding features breaking things, I mean.)

[21:20] <japhb> Xliff: Can you post the code so we can see what those 105 lines actually look like?

[21:23] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/raku-Teleprompter

[21:59] <japhb> That's not too bad, API wise.  Good job, Xliff++
