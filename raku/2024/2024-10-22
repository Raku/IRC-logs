[08:05] <SmokeMachine> Hi again! So yesterday I started playing with the CSS selectors idea... then I added a Str multi to ast-query... this is how it's looking for now: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/a9XsSjbN/image.png

[09:21] *** MorayJ joined
[09:39] <MorayJ> Hello - I'm tyring to watch a file with `my $supply = IO::Notification.watch-path( "./log.txt" ).act({say 'Hello'}); sleep 100`. I've got the sleep in, because I want the script to keep running (is there a better way?). And is the sleep, sleeping the Supply. The response to changing the file is erratic. One save may get 1 response, another will get none, and another will get multiple.

[09:39] <MorayJ> I'm using Rakudo‚Ñ¢ v2024.09

[09:48] <MorayJ> To make that more of question - how would I keep a script running to watch a file and just send one change response whenver the file changes? :-)

[09:58] <lizmat> MorayJ: fwiw, on MacOS I've found that notices of changes may actually take quite a long time before the OS delivers them

[09:59] <lizmat> also, the number of change notices indeed varies, so much I usuallly have that supply run through .squish

[10:00] <lizmat> as far as I've been able to determine, it's the OS being "flaky"...  not Raku

[10:02] *** MorayJ left
[10:04] *** MorayJ joined
[10:06] <MorayJ> Ah, ok. Thanks. I'm on Ubuntu and presumably seeing the same issues - thank you. May just try visiting the log periodically rather than waiting for a notify...

[10:11] <lizmat> FWIW, the watch-file feature *is* being used by the irclogs.raku.org site, so that any new lines (stored by https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/IRC::Client::Plugin::Logger) are seen by the server

[10:11] <lizmat> to allow the "live" feature to work

[10:40] *** Aedil joined
[10:58] <SmokeMachine> I have tested that many times while I was writing https://github.com/FCO/Configuration on Mac OS and didn't get a delay.. odd...

[11:08] <lizmat> it also depends on how busy the system is

[11:08] <lizmat> it's apparently low prio

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> Wonder whether any flakiness is down to use of FSEvents (vs Kqueue): https://watchexec.github.io/docs/macos-fsevents.html

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Is the use of "Configuration" an alternative to using "TOML"? https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/TOML

[12:56] <SmokeMachine> yes, I think it could be... The idea with Configuration is having a declared way of a config, and it can (if you want) while your code is running... something that uses Configuration under the hood is this: https://github.com/FCO/RakuCron

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have to decide should I use "TOML", "YAMLish", or "Configuration" for configuring (Jupyter) chatbooks. I was considering using "YAMLish", but since @bduggan uses "TOML", I might use that too.

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... that is probably a good idea for Jupyter notebooks in general. OTH, notebooks are "restarted" often (at Ieast mine are), so having run-time configuration changes is less important.

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I can see important though when very bulky and time consuming computations are run. Restarting would loose the context.

[13:03] <SmokeMachine> with Configuration you define a class that your configuration will look like and it will generate a "builder" to you... so, for example, if you want to have a config for a DB  (for example) you can define your class like: `class DBConfig { has Str $.host = "localhost"; has UInt $.port = 5432; has Str $.database = "postgres" } ` then your configuration could look like: `config { .database = "a_different_db_name" }`

[14:57] <ab5tract> MorayJ: instead of sleep you might want to look into using react / whenever

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> has anyone else seen issues with the last statement in a for block not executing?

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I think there's some overzealous optimization happening or something

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> in another file I am exporting this with sub EXPORT: '&qlog' => sub qlog(*@_, *%_) { Logging::qlog($caller-name, |@_, |%_) };

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Never happened to me. Do you happen to have some golfed down code where this occurs?

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> that Logging::qlog sub ultimately prints to either STDOUT or STDERR, and at first I thought this was just a buffering/flushing issue, but I don't think it is

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> a pointy block like for ^2 -> $i { qlog :d, "Alpha $i"; qlog :d, "Beta $i"; } only prints Alpha 0 and Alpha 1

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> it works fine if it's just a plain block without the pointy bit

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> I suspect something to do with last line implicit return and optimization

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> the same thing with say instead of my exported logging routine works as expected, though

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> ah, and if I add --> Nil to that qlog signature, it works as expected

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> this is probably enough info to make a github issue... one sec

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I would like to reproduce the problem on my machine, but I'm missing some elements: the Logging module, the $caller-name variable. Needs more golfing? üòï

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> yeah, working now to golf it down to something transferrable

[17:43] *** clarkema left
[17:58] <lucs> Hmm... I hadn't realized that a signature like ``(*@_, *%_)`` could work properly

[17:59] <lucs> m: sub baz(*@a, *%h) { say @a.join, '-', %h.values.join; }; baz 1, a => 11, 2, 3, b => 22, c => 33, 4;

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> yeah, it slurps all the positional and named params

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> convenient for passthrough like what I'm doing

[17:59] <lucs> I was surprised that they could be interleaved.

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have enjoyed YAMLish ‚Ä¶ it is very natural for config structures and the YAMLish module is very well  designed so you can override the defaults if you need

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good to know!

[20:41] <SmokeMachine> I'm almost liking the CSS selector way... my new test: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/zV0rhZZi/image.png

[20:44] <SmokeMachine> that 2 should probably not be wrapped with ""... but otherwise it thinks its a class name... maybe I should fix that some how...

[20:47] <SmokeMachine> I mean that recursively can be a new node definition: https://github.com/FCO/ASTQuery/blob/main/lib/ASTQuery/Grammar.rakumod#L35

[20:57] <Xliff> vrurg: Heya. Did you get my message about IP::Addr?

[20:58] <vrurg> Xliff: yes, and even replied to it. Though, the link you provided gives me "no page found".

[20:58] <Xliff> OOB: Does anyone know what "cr.$dispose()" means? I'm trying to convert that bit of Javascript to Raku

[20:59] <Xliff> vrurg: You did. Huh. Lemme check.

[20:59] <vrurg> Without the page I have no context.

[21:01] *** teatime joined
[21:05] <Xliff> Do you have an email I can use? Or are you registered on Repl.it?

[21:05] <Xliff> If not, I'll have to move it somewhere else.

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my friend ChatGPT says in JavaScript, dispose() methods are often used to signal the cleanup of objects that won't be needed anymore to prevent memory leaks.

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ;-)

[21:07] <Xliff> librasteve: Yea, well the response I got from #javascript is that cr.$dispose calls the method named "$dispose"

[21:07] <Xliff> Which is just.... wrong... on so many levels! :)

[21:07] <Xliff> Javascript is not Raku! So why the sigil!?!?

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - sorry ... I can't add anything

[21:12] <vrurg> Xliff: they use it sometimes to mark some kind of system-like stuff. See jquery, for example.

[21:12] <vrurg> They treat $ is an allowed identificator symbol, AFAIK.

[21:14] <Xliff> *groan* -- *smh*

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyone know where is the live version of cro http source on gh? (I am planning a PR)
