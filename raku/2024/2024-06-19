[15:10] <[Coke]> Folks, I will be in Vegas (coincidentally) during the conference next week for a small window. I had spoken to Util about meeting up with him briefly, but I can't justify getting a conference pass for the small amount of time I'll be there. If anyone else is going and wants to grab a cup of coffee or something, let me know. I'm guessing the one day I'll be there is Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon, but 

[15:10] <[Coke]> not sure yet. (Driving cross country with no specific deadlines)

[15:11] *** beastieboo joined
[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke Please consider donating your itinerary for blog a Raku post showcasing Geo-related algorithms. Maybe titled "WWCG" (i.e. "Where Would Coke Go.")

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Not, "Where Would the Coke Go", or similar...

[15:28] <[Coke]> I'll consider "where did I go"

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Coke This a joke, of course. I am considering getting different traveling paths and making prefix trees of them. (Say, using geohashes.)

[15:28] <[Coke]> (at which point my location won't be public. :)

[15:30] <[Coke]> I can probably get my actual path or an approximately out of google tracking.

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again, that would be cool, but consider different privacy angles.

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ideally, you will be interested to just do it for your own consumption. (With Raku tools.)

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... There are probably some databases with "donated" traveling paths. Also, I am sure I can use LLMs to generate different driving itineraries all arriving in, say, Las Vegas from different locations of North America.

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have another series of package name(spacing) questions.

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is package "Math::ChebyshevPolynomial" (https://github.com/colomon/Math-ChebyshevPolynomial) -- interesting implementation. But the package itself is:  (1) abandoned, and (2) borderline useless because of lack of documentation.

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> omg

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I want to implement similar functionalities, but I think this package POV (given in its implementation) should be preserved.

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Since, there is namespace "Math::Polynomial", I consider making "Math::Polynomial::Chebyshev".

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Alternatively, I can fork and refactor "Math::ChebyshevPolynomial" and make its implementation one of the methods for computing Chebyshev polynomials.

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The refactoring is not that simple, because, as I said, "Math::ChebyshevPolynomial", takes a particular POV of how Chebyshev polynomial functionalitiess are concertely used in Raku.

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Which I find interested, but unlikely to use.)

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, I like my idea for "Math::Polynomial::Chebyshev". Other similar names could be "Math::Polynomial::Legendre" or "Math::Polynomial::Romanovski", etc.

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But, of course, that might produce some confusion with "Math::ChebyshevPolynomial".

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, I am willing to hear other related ideas. (Or complete agreement!!)

[21:14] *** beastieboo_ joined
[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> colomon's stuff is 9+ years old ... I suggest you ping them and ask if they have an opinion (mainly in the interest of getting them back in the game)

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I was thinking that -- colomon has almost zero GitHub activity in the last few years.

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The repository has a 3-4 PRs, unmerged / unaddressed.

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> from a community POV, I think we should all try to not fracture the space - so if you would fork, keep the name, bump the API and release, I think that would reduce balkanisation and force any (hah!) dependents to the surface

[21:17] *** beastieboo left
[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or maybe not even fork and just reinvent the API

[21:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agreed, but I think "Math::ChebyshevPolynomial" is the wrong name to begin with. I would be have been more willing to do what you suggest if the package was named "Math::Polynomial::Chebyshev".

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As for balkanization -- yeah, that is kind of my fear / hesitance too.

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok, I submit :- complete agreement it is

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The problem with those polynomial type of packages that they potentially with large code bases if "done right."

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well colomon has about 41 lines in theirs

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (akthough I like the /t files)

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right, but say I cannot use that package to make a list basis functions which I can give to the linear models in "Math::Fitting".

[21:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - this is interpolation

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I can probably use it to make a design matrix. Fine, it is in my TODO to make "Math::Fitting" work with design matrices as input argument.

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nice

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But, that is a strange workflow for a "simple raku user."

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Using design matrices as computation specs.)

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve  "nice" -- Design matrices are, of course, used internally in "Math::Fitting".

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> googles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am happy if every raku module maps to a wikipedia topic

[21:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Math::Fitting" can do computations like linear-model-fit(@data, basis => [$f1, &f2, $f3]). I want to have "quick" ways of specifying well-known function bases. (B-spline, Chebyshev, etc.)

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Then, I am happy to to note that several Wikipedia articles map to "Math::Fitting". ðŸ˜Ž

[21:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I would prefer M:N of modules:wikipedia pages where M<<N

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right, definitely can happen with: function fitting, clustering, spatial search, latent semantic analysis.

[21:35] *** beastieboo__ joined
[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For the record: Using a design matrix my previous code example should be changed into my $dm = Matrix.new(@data.map({ [&f1, &f2, &f3].map(-> &f { &f($_) }) })); linear-model-fit($dm) .

[21:38] *** beastieboo_ left
[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is kind of inconvenient in most day-to-day data science and/or signal processing.

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah, well with raku we have a clean sheet ... so I expect you will find a way to make it convenient ;-)

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry - must depart

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is how a basis of Chebyshev T functions looks like (plotted with Raku in Jupyter):
