[03:04] <zorfnorf> Hi, completely new to programming (well, kinda, I use the terminal since the late 90s and used sh, but nothing further than simple scripts). I want to learn Raku but I don't know where to start (I'm not starting from absolute zero, I know about scope, variables, functions, etc.) Can someone give me pointers on how to learn it? Preferably on an

[03:04] <zorfnorf> incremental way this -> that -> the other...

[05:44] <disbot4> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: dang … editing on iPad as on the road this week … hopefully NOW is fixed

[05:46] <disbot4> <librasteve> zorfnorf: hi! i learned raku from Think Raku … an excellent book to teach programming from scratch in raku.

[05:48] <disbot4> <librasteve> https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/ (it was renamed from Think Perl6) and there is a free PDF version

[05:49] <disbot4> <librasteve> if that is too heavy, then maybe try the shorter https://raku.guide

[06:30] <disbot4> <librasteve> Voldenet: please take a look at https://github.com/librasteve/Air/issues/24 … i think that resolves your point?

[06:32] <disbot4> <librasteve> Smokemachine: please take a look at https://github.com/librasteve/Air/issues/24 … suggestion for Air::Component and Cromponent to use the same names for these utility methods…

[08:20] <Voldenet> guifa: I had most of the code available, only last few lines are new – I use this boilerplate with "c-library" all the time for testing NativeCall things

[08:20] <guifa> ah nice

[08:22] <guifa> I finally got things working and it's not toooooo bad.  Basically both the Raku and the Obj-C side have a generic supermethod (top level function in C world, sub in Raku world) and they just farm things out.  Ultimately not too terribly bad

[08:22] <guifa> sub FOO ($id, @args) { @instances[$id].foo: @args }

[08:24] <guifa> void foo (instance * i, int * arg) { [i foo: arg]; }

[08:24] <guifa> and then otherwise code as normal

[08:37] <Voldenet> I thought a bit about it and it should be possible to smuggle the raku pointers by using WHERE and evil pointer magic

[08:37] <Voldenet> would be extremely brittle though

[08:39] <Voldenet> even if it's possible to cast arbitrary pointer to raku objects

[08:50] *** lichtkind joined
[08:55] <Voldenet> librasteve: yeah, that sums it up - the other concern was "how to tightly couple model and form so that form can refer to `text` property in a model", but I don't know any obvious way to say `nameof(Todo.text)`

[08:55] <tellable6> Voldenet, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[08:56] <Voldenet> some frameworks do that by generating the whole form automatically, which could be done here too, but that'd be out of scope

[10:48] <wayland> Voldenet: Thanks for the heads up about the links.  I've fixed that again.  That's probably the biggest drawback to this website setuo -- I keep accidentally committing that.  

[10:48] <tellable6> 2025-07-28T15:40:12Z #raku <Voldenet> wayland: some things broke and https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/general/Documentation-Categorisation.xml links to localhost:8000 for most resources now :/

[10:55] <notable6> wayland, Noted! (weekly)

[10:56] <lizmat> wayland: the localhost:8000 url is pretty useless  :-)

[10:57] <wayland> Argh!  Did it again!

[10:58] <notable6> wayland, Noted! (weekly)

[10:59] <wayland> Hopefully that one will work.  

[11:01] <lizmat> it does

[11:05] <guifa> Voldenet it's probably best at the moment to keep the restrictions what they are -- after all, nasty things could happen if someone tried to do anything other than just pass the pointer back to Raku

[11:06] <guifa> right now for my JS bridge I'm just limiting it to things that can be sent in text/json representation, no actual object references

[11:51] <zorfnorf> Is there a way to disable colors and emojis on the repl?

[11:54] <lizmat> perhaps setting the RAKUDO_ERROR_COLOR=0 environment variable ?

[11:56] <zorfnorf> Oh, thanks! I was looking for some kind of .rakurc or similar.

[11:57] <lizmat> alas, no  :-)

[12:00] <Voldenet> thing to consider https://no-color.org/

[12:01] <lizmat> PRs welcome  :-)

[12:02] <zorfnorf> Oh nice! I don't know if it's because I'm a beginner (this is my second day learning to program and Raku), but I find colors confusing. I can't believe that programmers are used to all that colors in the editor. I turned them off immediately.

[12:08] <Voldenet> it's such a niche use case that I forgot that NO_COLOR existed for years, remembered it only because it's the exactly same use case

[12:08] <Voldenet> programmers use spaces to seek through text fast and colors to make it even faster, but some colorschemes get in the way

[12:09] <Voldenet> so I usually prefer various tints of blue/green/gray, never use red or yellow

[12:10] <zorfnorf> Yeah, I tend to associate red with errors/warnings.

[12:10] <zorfnorf> I have a tiny program that colors stderr in red to stand out, i.e. foo | red

[12:17] *** guifa left
[12:22] <Voldenet> I admit that it makes me a bit annoyed that vim by default uses a lot of red for raku

[12:23] <Voldenet> so instead I use nano which doesn't color things very much

[12:26] <zorfnorf> I just use vim with syntax off.

[12:28] <zorfnorf> I think I found a bug in zef: I tried to install a module and it failed saying it didn't had a META6.json file, but I checked at GitHub and it has. So after a little spelunking I discovered that I can just put the GitHub URL + .git and zef installed it without problems.

[12:30] <zorfnorf> I have no idea how git works, I just know that you can save the program and go back- or forwards if needed.

[12:31] <lizmat> zorfnorf: which distribution are you talking about ?

[12:33] <zorfnorf> I installed Raku on macOS (ARM) using rakubrew (the curl | sh method), and when I tried to install both JSON::Fast and Text::Markdown I got the same error: "Extraction: Failed to find a META6.json file for <MODULE-NAME> -- failure is likely

[12:33] <zorfnorf> <MODULE-NAME> Extracting with plugin Zef::Service::Shell::tar aborted."

[12:34] <lizmat> what does "raku -v" say ?

[12:34] <zorfnorf> Welcome to Rakudo™ v2025.06.1.

[12:34] <zorfnorf> Implementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d.

[12:34] <zorfnorf> Built on MoarVM version 2025.06.

[12:34] <lizmat> ok, that's pretty decent :-)

[12:35] <lizmat> so you invoked it with "zef install JSON::Fast"  ?   and it failed ?

[12:35] <zorfnorf> Yes. But if I use zef install <github-url>.git everything works.

[12:36] <lizmat> what does: zef --version     say ?

[12:36] <zorfnorf> Just prints 1.0.0

[12:37] <lizmat> then I have no idea what's going on

[12:39] <zorfnorf> Can I paste the whole error here?

[12:39] <lizmat> better in a gist

[12:42] <zorfnorf> https://p.fr33tux.org/e5344f

[12:44] <lizmat> wfm  :-(

[12:44] <lizmat> patrickb ^^  any ideas ?

[12:47] <[Coke]> what's the install command that generates that?

[12:48] <zorfnorf> zef install Template::Mustache (which couldn't install JSON::Fast), it also happens with Text::Markdown, which can't install HTML::Escape.

[12:49] <zorfnorf> ===> Failed to find dependencies: HTML::Escape

[12:49] <zorfnorf> Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="HTML::Escape" to skip)

[12:49] <[Coke]> extraction failed - is your disk full, perhaps?

[12:49] <zorfnorf> But if I do zef search HTML::Escape, it exists.

[12:49] <[Coke]> there's definitely a META6.json file in the distro

[12:49] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: you could just change the colorscheme, no?

[12:49] <zorfnorf> [Coke] 183,29 GB available of 245,11 GB

[12:50] <zorfnorf> [Coke] yes, there is, I checked.

[12:50] <patrickb> oof. I have many questions. That module is available in P6C and CPAN. I'm a bit unsure which it tried to install. Looking at the auth in the path it seems to go for the P6C one. Shouldn't that be REA then?

[12:50] <patrickb> Does the archive in the error message exist on your system? is it extractable?

[12:51] <[Coke]> curious if 'zef look HTML::Escape' works for you (should put you in a tmp dir where you can verify there is in fact a META6.json)

[12:52] <[Coke]> zorfnorf: what's the "source-url" you get from "zef info HTML::Escape"

[12:52] <lizmat> perhaps it's a zef config issue ?

[12:53] <zorfnorf> zef info HTML::Escape

[12:53] <zorfnorf> ===> Searching for: HTML::Escape

[12:53] <zorfnorf> !!!> Found no candidates matching identity: HTML::Escape

[12:53] <zorfnorf> But zef search HTML::Escape does find 3 versions of it.

[12:56] <zorfnorf> I tried to extract the .tar.gz on /var/ and got tar: Error opening archive: Error reading <file path here>

[12:57] <[Coke]> OOC, what is your tar version? You have one from homebrew installed or something?

[12:58] <[Coke]> on my old mac (where this works) I have bsdtar 3.5.1 - libarchive 3.5.1 zlib/1.2.11 liblzma/5.0.5 bz2lib/1.0.8

[12:58] <zorfnorf> No, it's the system's: bsdtar 3.5.3 - libarchive 3.7.4 zlib/1.2.12 liblzma/5.4.3 bz2lib/1.0.8

[12:58] <[Coke]> cool

[12:58] <zorfnorf> zef install https://github.com/moznion/p6-HTML-Escape.git worked without errors.

[13:03] <zorfnorf> It also works with zef install 'HTML::Escape:ver<0.0.1>'

[13:05] <patrickb> So to sum up, there is a .tar file on your system that is somehow broken (size == 0?) or unreadable. Is it a permissions error? Is there some Anti-Virus stuff going on that changes the permissions on downloaded files?

[13:06] <zorfnorf> No antivirus, I think I somehow had a hiccup and the download got corrupt. I uninstalled and reinstalled just with the module's name and everything worked.

[13:06] <patrickb> can that file be copied? opened in a text editor? What's the file size? Output of `file /path/to/file.tar.gz`?

[13:06] <patrickb> ok.

[13:07] <zorfnorf> the output of file says it's a directory (what?!)

[13:11] <[Coke]> maybe need to nuke the zef download area (I forget the zef command for this)

[13:12] <Voldenet> SmokeMachine: hence "by default", vim is so flexible that I can use it to play doom :)

[13:13] <zorfnorf> [Coke] zef nuke site home

[13:17] <zorfnorf> zef nuke site home && rakubrew build-zef and everything worked

[13:21] <lizmat> no worries!

[14:57] <disbot4> <librasteve> Voldenet: there’s a whole other module Air::Form for that … I’ll post on that next week. (Which was quite an interesting journey in “how to smush Cro forms and HTMX form behaviors together in a useful way”)

[15:00] *** guifa joined
[16:28] <disbot4> <antononcube> @guifa I just finished watching your TPRC 2025 conference talk. (Something about Corinna and Camellia.) It is good, but too much time was spent on a certain language known as Perl.

[16:28] <guifa> ha the original plan was to do that talk and then a Raku-only talk

[16:29] <disbot4> <antononcube> 🙂 Nice plan -- what happened ?!

[16:31] <disbot4> <antononcube> Would you record and publish the Raku-only talk?

[16:32] <guifa> we had a few more other Raku talks that were offered so we decided to have me just do the one

[16:32] <guifa> but then codesections and others got sick but I didn't have time to write out one of the other talks

[16:32] <guifa> my new UI::HTMLWindow will probably also make a nice talk

[16:33] <disbot4> <antononcube> Does "UI::HTMLWindow" provide interactive elements? Like sliders and buttons?

[16:35] <guifa> Yes, since it basically gives you a window that you insert in HTML into

[16:35] <guifa> I'm working on expanding interactivity, but at the moment, you can call Raku methods from JS and vice versa

[16:36] *** dakkar left
[16:36] <disbot4> <antononcube> ✍️

[16:37] <disbot4> <antononcube> I have mentioned this before -- I am interested in Raku replacement(s) of R-Shiny.

[16:38] <guifa> the goal is that you'll be able to just pop up a window in any OS and provide a simple (or complex, only limited by HTML/CSS/JS) UI while doing everything else on the backend in Raku

[16:41] <disbot4> <antononcube> Here is an example of the ideal end result for me: https://antononcube.shinyapps.io/GNNMonTimeSeriesAnomaliesDetection/

[16:44] <guifa> see above: if you can show it in HTML you can handle it in Raku :) 

[16:45] <guifa> to be it's a little bit nicer than opening up an HTML server and then opening up the browser

[16:48] <disbot4> <antononcube> Ok. See the source code in that link. I think it should not be (that) hard to generate the corresponding "UI::HTMLWindow" code from a Markdown file.

[16:49] <guifa> so the way it's set up, if you have the html/css/js code, you'll be able to just add them as files.  Those are copied into a temp folder and the run as a file://.  With the big exception you'll get to respond to various window events too and interact directly with JS

[16:50] <disbot4> <antononcube> BTW, the services of shinyapps.io is a "serious business" for Posit (formerly RStudio.) The advantage is that "anyone, anywhere" can use those interfactive interfaces/

[16:51] <disbot4> <antononcube> Hmm... that Raku-workflow is less convenient that what "shinyapps.io" and RStudio IDE provide. But it can be productized into something similar.

[16:53] *** zorfnorf joined
[16:55] <guifa> I don't figure it's ideal for all use cases, but I think it'll be good for a lot of them

[16:55] <guifa> in classic form, this is a stepping stone towards another large project ha

[16:56] <disbot4> <antononcube> Yes, so it seems.

[16:56] <zorfnorf> Just a heads up: I was trying to install some modules (File::Which and Fire::Directory::Tree) and zef displayed an error saying "candidates found matching identity: <module name here>". I ran zef update and got the same behavior, when I opened .zef/store/META.json it contained a single line: "429: Too Many Requests". This can be verified by running

[16:56] <zorfnorf> curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json"
