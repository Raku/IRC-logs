[18:00] <tbrowder> hi, is there any quick way to get a "call tree' for debugging a broken program? the only editors i use are emacs and vi. thanks 

[18:09] <lizmat> you mean a backtrace ?

[18:41] <[Coke]> adding '--ll-exception' to the command line args for rakudo will give you a more full trace

[18:50] <tbrowder> yes, back trace sounds right (maybe too much info, haven't done one of those for many years, thanks lizmat and Coke
