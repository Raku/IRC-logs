[00:02] <[Coke]> is there a way to run a new github action against an old PR?

[00:02] <[Coke]> Could click "rerun" if it had ever been run, but it hadn't...

[00:04] *** justache is now known as KennyLog-in

[00:06] <[Coke]> fixed the test workflow for raku/doc so it a) runs, b) on a recent rakudo, c) only those things that have changed in the PR or commit get tested.

[13:02] <disbot3> <melezhik.> .

[13:02] <disbot3> <melezhik.> Hi! Have just released a new version of Sparky allowing to pass meta information from child jobs back to parent , lightweight alternative to job stashes check it out - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/docs/job_api.md#job-meta

[13:08] *** melezhik_ joined
[13:09] <melezhik_> raku.land still is not up to date, new versions do not show up ...

[13:09] <tellable6> 2025-10-04T12:15:39Z #raku-dev <patrickb> melezhik: I've had a look. Arm64 is pretty doable (I lean towards use hetzner to create a throwaway server for the build, alternative: Google cloud, RPi in basement).

[13:09] <tellable6> 2025-10-04T12:17:10Z #raku-dev <patrickb> melezhik: RISCV is a different beast. I don't know if anyone ever managed to get Rakudo building or running on RISCV at all. That would be the first step.

[13:09] <tellable6> 2025-10-04T12:20:30Z #raku-dev <patrickb> melezhik: Do you know whether the rocky Linux people managed to build or run Rakudo?

[13:09] <tellable6> 2025-10-04T12:23:08Z #raku-dev <patrickb> melezhik: it seems riscv actually does compile already. Yay!

[13:14] <melezhik_> patrickb: yep they have some progress with RISC-V

[13:26] <melezhik> patrickb: rocky linux dev who build Rakudo ask me to share this with you - https://git.resf.org/testing/Sparky_Getting_Started#install-raku-risc-v

[13:27] <melezhik> Also if you need a RISC-V board he might share you the one “And if they need a Risc-v board for compiling... there's a good chance I can get them one.”
