[13:53] <tbrowder> .tell raiph i’ve used term ‘parameter’ instead of ‘argument’ as you suggested

[13:53] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to raiph

[15:14] <tbrowder> just watched [Coke]'s presento, excellent, but fast! too bad you didn't have a chance for a longer session! some questions for [Coke]: (1) is there a complete, summary list of the current status of all the planned Raku changes somewhere we can print or copy for a slide, (2) what app did you use for the slides, and (3) are your glasses capable of easily seeing distance and reading (bi- or tri-focal)? i need new glasses badly and 

[15:14] <tbrowder> yours look comfortable?

[15:49] <disbot3> <librasteve> great talk!

[21:31] <arkiuat> so in https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Coercion it says "To allow built-in types to turn themselves into user defined types use augment or the MOP.

[21:31] <arkiuat> Raku highlighting

[21:32] <arkiuat> but the only example given is using augment.

[21:32] <arkiuat> Can one do this with the MOP without using MONKEY-TYPING?

[21:33] <lizmat> yeah, and you probably shouldn't use augment unless you really, *really* know what you're doing

[21:34] <lizmat> as to using the MOP: what are you trying to achieve?

[21:34] <arkiuat> right, that's what I've heard, which is why I thought it weird that the doco gave an example using augment and not using MOP

[21:35] <arkiuat> well, I have subset of Int where { 0 <= $_ < 1 } and it needs to add and subtract circularly, as if 1 corresponded to 2 pi and these were radians

[21:35] <lizmat> that probably needs fixing: looks like that example is pretty olf

[21:35] <arkiuat> and it was handy to defined multi for infix + and -

[21:36] <arkiuat> everything's working fine, it just would be nice to coerce a Real between 0 and 1 to one of these

[21:39] <arkiuat> oh wait, % works on Num doesn't it.  I should just be doing these %1

[21:39] <lizmat> feels like it ?

[21:39] <arkiuat> not used to having a modulo operator that isn't Int-only

[21:40] <arkiuat> still, I'd like to have type check on the range

[21:40] <arkiuat> and I misstated the subset, sorry; it's a subset of Real

[21:41] <lizmat> wouldn't adding a infix<+> op for the subset type work ?

[21:42] <arkiuat> yes, I've done that already, although I just redefined it to use %1

[21:43] <arkiuat> but if I feed a Real between 0 and 1 to one of the other methods defined for this type, it coughs up a type error

[21:43] <arkiuat> so I'd like to add a type-coercion method to Real without using augment

[21:43] <lizmat> sadly the coercion protocol is not very well documented yet

[21:44] <lizmat> perhaps https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/227 can be of use

[21:44] <arkiuat> thank you! i'll take a look

[21:57] <arkiuat> well, after reading most of that, my first thought is it might be easier to just write multi methods handling the base types I'd need to coerce

[22:00] <arkiuat> heh, except when I switch screens to go look over the error messages from prove6 again, the first one that catches my eye is a failure of BUILD on type-check

[22:01] <arkiuat> which was working fine when I was using a subset instead of a class. I turned the subset into a class so I could add the multi infix methods for + and -

[22:03] <arkiuat> er, multi infix subs, I guess

[22:13] <arkiuat> well, for now, I'm just backing of that class and back to the named subset. I can still use the infix redefinitions for the named subset: I only turned it into a class because I thought it might be easy to add a coercion method after doing that, but apparently not

[22:14] <lizmat> yeah, looks like I put you in the wrong direction, sorry

[22:15] <arkiuat> not at all! I don't think there's really any easier way I could have learned what I now know about how difficult it can be to coerce basic built-in types to custom ones

[22:15] <arkiuat> I had no idea just an hour ago
