[07:44] <disbot1> <librasteve> this is gonna sound pretty odd, but is there a way to “bell” a terminal from raku … eg in the repl go something like sleep 5; bell; or failing that a shell cmd that I can run from raku?

[07:47] <Aedil> disbot1: On Linux?

[07:47] <Aedil> disbot1: I know a way on Linux.

[07:56] <Aedil> Here is a way for a Linux terminal alarm bell:

[12:35] <disbot1> <antononcube> @librasteve So, your reinstalled raku and Jupyter kernels started running?

[12:35] <tellable6> 2025-10-28T09:54:15Z #raku <wayland76> antononcube Definitely not a vi guy.  I lean towards nano (pine was my first e-mail program).  I probably could've gone emacs if it'd been a bit easier.  

[12:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> @antononcube sorry I am not sure what I did differently (likely a clean of rakubrew, but was soe time ago) - all is working fine now

[12:36] <disbot1> <antononcube> Did you use rakubrew or installed raku directly?

[12:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> i prefer rakubrew

[12:36] <disbot1> <antononcube> Ok, good to know.

[12:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> thanks for the advice on raku -e 'say "\a"' - working fine on macos and termius (except I would prefer termius to beep not vibrate but nevermind) - oh and I had to enable audibek bell in the mac terminal app settings ;-)

[12:42] *** arkiuat joined
[12:42] <disbot1> <librasteve> finally found that setting on termius

[12:46] *** arkiuat left
[12:55] <ab5tract> Voldenet: I think it’s always been there as our version indirect object notation, though probably it was NYI for years. I recently fixed it for the feed operators in RakuAST. It shines pretty nicely in that context

[17:49] <notable6> librasteve_, 5 notes: https://gist.github.com/56e0f643980a9f50d6d9459c2b74db15

[18:02] <ingy> btw if anyone is interested, check out https://github.com/makeplus/makes https://github.com/makeplus/makes/blob/main/raku.mk 

[18:03] <ingy> and esp https://github.com/makeplus/makes?tab=readme-ov-file#makes-shells

[18:03] <tbrowder> folks, sorry about the false alarm on App::Mi6. i must have some weird thing set in my environment varibles set that causes the behavior. i have closed the issue there.

[18:05] <tbrowder> but the good news for me is lizmat's Test::Output does help my weird system pass lives-ok tests.

[18:08] <ingy> with that `msh` bash function you can `msh raku` or `msh raku RAKU-VERSION=2025.08-01` and have a subshell with raku (or any other supported thing) in your PATH

[18:10] <ingy> I use this Makes system for dozens of projects. I use raku.mk for Raku related targets in https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript. And for 14 other langs there. I don't have raku or most of those langs installed in advance.

[18:11] <ingy> I doubt most people here would use it for raku (maybe for alternate versions), but maybe for toying with other langs.

[18:12] <ingy> Anyway, thought you should know...

[18:15] <librasteve_> weekly: piece on raku advent

[18:15] <notable6> librasteve_, Noted! (weekly)

[18:18] <librasteve_> I am planning to pre announce the raku advent blog in the next weekly - the wordpress site and github repo need to be prepared - also it would be very nice if we could simplify the instructions on how to make raku code highlite for the wordpress HTML box … I have some ideas on this to use Rainbow … hopefully I can get the ball rolling on that in the next day or two … I can also take the job of the Wordpress refresh … 

[18:18] <librasteve_> would anyone like to help me on that?

[19:42] <[Coke]> Very happy I got to meet Audrey in person once.

[19:50] <guifa> actually, this might be a nice time for my UI::HTMLWindow show off if I can finish it up in time

[19:51] <guifa> would be really cool to have a web animation going on and in the terminal you can type in stuff like "more snow", "more lights", "colorful lights" etc

[20:02] <guifa> I'm just really frustrated that my core goal: to allow nearly direct seamless calling won't work because of macos's insistence of having stuff run in a main thread, meaning I have to spin off the process

[20:19] *** apa_c joined
[20:31] *** melezhik left
[20:33] <disbot1> <librasteve> guifa: that sounds very cool -- please bear in mind that we need HTML we can paste into a wordpress.com raw HTML component ... I guess that will allow HTML and inline style ... but JS likely not (maybe but it would need to be tested in the target context)

[20:52] <tbrowder> speaking of raku-advent.blog, i'm using chatgpt to create a module to post rakudoc articles to the site as drafts in waiting and schedule them for public view. i'll put it on github if anyone is interested.

[20:55] <tbrowder> you'll need an author password and an account on Wordpress. the README should give all details. no matter what the product finally looks like, it has tobe better than what i've been struggling with for years.

[20:55] <disbot1> <librasteve> tbrowder: please do and share the link ... wordpress has this functionality, so I am not sure what you are proposing (but share the GH and it will hopefully be clear)

[20:56] *** justache joined
[20:57] <disbot1> <librasteve> tbh the mechanics of scheduling are easy, the non trivial bit is spreading authors around, and panicking / chivvying / managing reserves when there is a shortage ...

[20:57] *** arkiuat joined
[21:00] <lizmat> yeah, the content is the issue, not the posting

[21:01] <[Coke]> ugh. I have a json file that is 6174 lines long, jsonlint.com says it's fine, JSON::Fast explodes.

[21:02] *** arkiuat left
[21:02] <lizmat> aah.. please make a JSON::Fast issue, and post the file there (if you can)

[21:02] <[Coke]> Are we trying for a christmas/santa themed advent this year or just 2x assorted articles?

[21:02] <[Coke]> It's an internal file, I'll try to golf it. :|

[21:03] <lizmat> having at least a few christmas / santa themed articles, would be nice, I think

[21:03] <[Coke]> at 7003, unexpected partitioner ':' inside list of things in an array

[21:04] <[Coke]> in past years, I found the combo slightly jarring, but I know we can't be choosy

[21:04] <lizmat> afk for the rest of the day&

[21:04] *** arkiuat joined
[21:04] <disbot1> <librasteve> i have taken a stab at this year's raku-advent.blog ... hope this is OK?

[21:04] <disbot1> <librasteve> ie updated the home page on wordpress.com

[21:06] <[Coke]> librasteve++

[21:08] <[Coke]> same error with JSON::Tiny

[21:16] <disbot1> <antononcube> Cannot make "Jupyter::Kernel" or "Jupyter::Chatbook" run with moar-2025.10 on macOS. 😭

[21:17] *** arkiuat left
[21:18] <[Coke]> (d'oh. it was not that json file, it was another one, and THAT one I'm parsing as JSONC) - this should have been obvious previously, but was especially so after installing a versino of JSON::FAST with debug output showing me more characters at the bad point.

[21:18] <[Coke]> *sigh*

[21:21] *** arkiuat joined
[21:22] <[Coke]> doesn't like a string with []'s in it

[21:37] <disbot1> <librasteve> @antononcube I am running Jupyter::Chatbook successfully on raku 2025.08, I just installed 2025.10 (rakubrew) and (since new rakubrew vrsions mean all new zef installs), I did a clean zef install Jupyter::Chatbook ... error #1 jupyter-chatbook.raku does not have permissions (so I did a chmod +x) ... error #2 from the browser says Error Starting Kernel The 'raku' kernel could not be started: "[Errno 8] Exec format error:

[21:37] <disbot1> 'jupyter-chatbook.raku'" when I select the raku kernel

[21:42] <disbot1> <antononcube> Yeah -- same here.

[21:42] <disbot1> <antononcube> Thanks for verifying!

[21:45] <disbot1> <librasteve> the solution is to paste the raku hashbang #!/usr/bin/env raku into the top line of /Users/xxx/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2025.10/share/perl6/site/bin/jupyter-chatbook.raku

[21:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> maybeee I did this on 2025.08 and then forgot the trick ... I dont have a scooby why that is now needed ... maybe good idea to file a rakudo issue ...?

[21:47] <[Coke]> there were no changes to the runners in 2025.10 I don't think

[21:48] <disbot1> <librasteve> yeah - but i think maybee I had to fix this before eg on 2025.08 ... and I have skipped several raku versions in the meantime

[21:49] <disbot1> <librasteve> ie last version when Jupyter::Chatbook didn't need this surgery could be back in the 2025.04/05 days

[21:50] <tbrowder> ok, my advent module project dir is on github at <https://github.com/tbrowder/RakuAdventWP-Poster> and i will be putting code there this evening

[21:50] <disbot1> <librasteve> tbrowder: cool - I am travelling this week ... will try to take a look soon

[21:50] <tbrowder> ok, that link works ^^^

[21:51] <disbot1> <librasteve> please can you help by providing a short README that describes the purpose of this module?

[22:01] *** Aedil left
[22:03] *** stanrifkin left
[22:04] *** apa_c left
[22:04] <disbot1> <antononcube> @librasteve  "the solution is [...]" -- Yes, I noticed that change in Brian Duggan's repository ("Jupyter::Kernel") so I made similar changes. I cannot run both kernels, though.

[22:05] <disbot1> <antononcube> Anyway, I will try what you suggest again tonight.

[22:24] <disbot1> <antononcube> @librasteve Your suggestions worked on moar-2025.08 -- thanks a lot!

[22:24] <disbot1> <librasteve> make sure you are looking in the right dir ... its the one that zef prints with "these scripts installed to..."

[22:24] <timo> [Coke]: so it ended up not being an issue with JSON::Fast or JSON::Tiny at all, but with JSONC? and you were looking at the wrong file, which made debugging harder?

[22:25] <disbot1> <antononcube> I had to force-test-install "HTTP::UserAgent".

[22:27] <[Coke]> timo: well, JSONC is still part of ::Fast, no?

[22:27] <[Coke]> showing more than just a ':' in the error message would have helped a lot.

[22:29] <timo> oh i wasn't aware of the allow-jsonc feature yet

[22:29] <disbot1> <librasteve> @antononcube yw ... I am slowly acclimatising to jupyter chatbook in intellij ... its like going from a Toyota Corolla to an F1 car

[22:30] <[Coke]> isn't fast your module?

[22:31] <timo> yes, but lizmat has contributed a lot to it

[22:32] <timo> https://github.com/timo/json_fast/commit/c3c10371d6331c241b940a1d57930acc4a9f0adc here is the initial commit for jsonc support

[22:36] <timo> well, i found a probably unrelated bug in the jsonc parsing parts where /*/ is parsed as a complete comment it seems like

[22:43] <timo> could i get the jsonc file that provokes the error you saw? or was the file actually invalid and you would just like some more debug output in general?

[22:52] <[Coke]> That version of the file is gone, I will try to reproduce the error and if it looks like a valid file, I'll submit a bug

[23:08] <timo> thanks

[23:19] <timo> hm. `[]` is supposed to parsefail?

[23:20] <timo> ... there is one in the yes-parse and one in the no-parse list of tests? huh?

[23:22] <timo> LEFT SQUARE BRACKET WORD JOINER RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET

[23:22] <timo> haha

[23:24] <timo> https://docs.raku.org/routine/uniprops the link to the icu userguide no longer links to a page that actually lists property names, it redirects to the main page of the userguide instead

[23:43] <timo> [Coke]: do you think there should be no data from the json document visible in the exception message without the debug env var (or whatever) supplied?

[23:50] <[Coke]> timo: good question; I think showing the single ':' in the original error wasn't at all helpful.

[23:51] <[Coke]> if you're up for changing what's showing, I think showing a chunk of test in the default error would be nice.

[23:51] <timo> i've got something to show already

[23:54] <timo> check the branch "errors_with_context" in JSON::Fast
