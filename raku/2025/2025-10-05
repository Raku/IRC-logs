[04:03] <japhb> I'm trying to `mi6 release` Terminal-Print, which has the auth zef:terminal-printers (which I am an admin of).  I am logged in to fez.  However when I try the `mi6 release` I get `auth 'zef:terminal-printers' in META6.json does not match auth 'zef:japhb' or 'zef:' in ~/.fez-config.json` -- anyone have any idea what could be messed up?

[04:03] <japhb> Just to be sure, I nuked my `~/.fez-config.json` and recreated it with `fez login`, but that didn't do anything.

[13:06] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw raiph 2024-11-18T22:12:37Z in #whateverable: <raiph> m: https://gist.github.com/raiph/d244e984dfbb51129ac34d97aeebaaf6

[13:32] <tbrowder> i just filed another doc issue to reflect prob i'm having with raku insisting i am using subtest even though i have not explicitly done so. now i am struggling to make it work with explicit subtests and  haven't yet succeeded.

[13:35] *** arkiuat joined
[13:35] <tbrowder> m: use Test; my @a = 0, 1, 2; is @a.elems, 3; for @a.kv -> $i, $n { is $i, $n }; done-testing;

[13:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - ␤ok 2 - ␤ok 3 - ␤ok 4 - ␤1..4␤»

[13:37] <tbrowder> hm, my real test is more complex, better go look closer...if i can't make progress will show gist later

[13:39] *** arkiuat left
[13:48] <[Coke]> instead of done-testing in that example, I would recommend plan 1+@.elems;

[13:48] <[Coke]> You should always plan when possible.

[13:49] <ab5tract> [Coke]++

[13:49] <ab5tract> I think `plan *` is also possible, though probably less preferrable

[13:54] *** arkiuat joined
[13:58] <[Coke]> m: use Test; plan *

[13:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «␤»

[13:58] <[Coke]> ew.

[13:59] <[Coke]> Note that 'plan *' isn't listed in the docs. (and seems no better than done-testing)

[13:59] <[Coke]> also plan * isn't in roast.

[14:05] <[Coke]> also why do we even have 'plan *' ??

[14:18] <ab5tract> it gets you one step closer to a plan, at least ;)

[14:23] <ugexe> plan * doesnt even do anything

[14:24] <[Coke]> I argue that it makes it look like you have  a plan when you don't, and then you'll forget to update it.

[14:24] <[Coke]> that is, it's actively worse.

[14:24] <ab5tract> [Coke]: agreed

[14:24] <ugexe> m: use Test; plan 1; die 42;

[14:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «1..1␤42␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤# You planned 1 test, but ran 0␤»

[14:25] <ugexe> m: use Test; plan *; die 42;

[14:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «␤42␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:26] <ugexe> 'plan *', even if it did work, could only be a much worse done-testing()

[14:26] <[Coke]> ugexe++

[14:26] <ugexe> m: use Test; plan 3..4; die 42;

[14:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «1..3 4␤42␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤# You planned 3 4 tests, but ran 0␤»

[14:26] <ugexe> i dont even know what that is supposed to mean

[14:31] <[Coke]> ...

[14:31] <[Coke]> m: use Test; plan "BARF"

[14:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar f6180a311: OUTPUT: «1..BARF␤# You planned BARF tests, but ran 0␤»

[14:32] * [Coke] reverts my recent documentation of 'plan *' and instead decides we should enforce plan Int.

[14:34] * [Coke] opens https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/498

[14:36] <tbrowder> note i found the problem, at least i "fixed". some debug "say" statements were unintentionally leaking out. eliminating those made the problem go away.

[17:01] *** arkiuat joined
[17:42] <[Coke]> if I have a snippet that has the test "use Foo" - is there a oneliner of code I can put before that so that the use will not fail (even if it has no content to use in it)

[17:43] <lizmat> ugexe might have an idea about that

[17:45] <[Coke]> Just trying to test more stuff in the docs.

[18:38] <ugexe> [Coke]: you'd have to do something like https://github.com/niner/CompUnit-Repository-Mask which isn't very much code at all, but the repo i link to doesn't have a way to make the it pretend to work when it is not installed

[18:43] <[Coke]> I can make that a pre-req for raku/doc testing, that's fine

[18:43] <[Coke]> thanks!
