[00:59] <Guest65> Hi everyone! Is there a page anywhere that has Raku news? Specifically new releases? I've searched high and low on the homepage and am unable to find anything (but I am admittedly super low iq so it very well might have been right under my nose)

[00:59] <Guest65> i just come back to raku every 6-12 months and it's always a mission to find the latest "whats new" (this time i will favorite it)

[01:03] <Guest65> ohhh nvm found what i needed in github releases thx anyway cheers

[02:16] <[Coke]> raku.org has an "install" link.

[02:28] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve or other Raku-advent curators -- Day 9 is published but does not appear in the main page.

[07:32] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube thanks for the nudge … need to set 2025 in the categories (my bad, I should have checked/done this)

[07:32] <disbot6> <librasteve> should be fine now

[08:13] <lizmat> antononcube why the use of "sink" in the "sink my @words2 = random-pet-name(*)».lc.grep(/ ^ [ra [k|c] | camel ] /);" example?   feels superfluous to me?

[08:14] <lizmat> also in: sink my $commands = q:to/END/;     feels a bit cargo-culty ?    or possibly ill-generated LLM code ?

[08:15] <lizmat> I guess that applies to all "sink" use in https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/09/monadic-programming-examples/ ?

[11:32] <disbot6> <antononcube> @lizmat This is a popular question — it is to prevent printing out the value of the last evaluated statement in Jupyter notebook cell. (This specific to the Raku kernels, although, other kernels behave similarly.)

[11:33] *** abraxxa1 left
[11:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> I can should have removed the sink usages…

[11:36] <lizmat> in the examples, they're non functional, so perhaps...

[12:56] <Voldenet> couldn't jupyter notebook cells just detect whether the statement ends with ; or not

[12:56] <Voldenet> and then add sink if they do

[12:56] <Voldenet> a bit hacky, but then it looks like a very normal code

[12:56] <Voldenet> iirc matlab does this

[12:59] <Voldenet> e.g. `say "x";` -> `sink { say "x"; }`, `say "y"` -> `say "y"`

[12:59] <Voldenet> I thought about it for a second and it would mess variables

[13:00] <Voldenet> still doable but non-trivial

[13:05] <disbot6> <antononcube> I detect finishing ; in the DSL cell I programmed for the Mathematica/Wolfram notebooks. I experimented with something similar for the Jupyter kernel.

[13:06] <disbot6> <antononcube> In general, for that kind of fundamental user experience change I will coordinate with Brian Duggan, since I would like both Raku-kernels to have the same core behavior.

[13:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> Right now, I am sort of accustomed to it. (It looks like I miss it in Python-Jupyter.)

[13:08] <disbot6> <antononcube> And, well, if Jupyter notebooks were more widely used in the Raku community, then user feedback would pointed direction and priority.

[13:31] <Voldenet> jupyter notebooks are comfy and all, but I really enjoy having all code in one file

[13:31] <Voldenet> this gets me 0 surprises, even if I work on incremental things

[13:31] <disbot6> <antononcube> A Jupyter notebook is one file, but I get what you are saying.

[13:32] <disbot6> <antononcube> For a very long time Jupyter notebooks were buggy and clunky, and I avoided as much I as can.

[13:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> This made some clueless managers mad, BTW.

[13:34] <Voldenet> though I suppose I don't really have the use case of "lots of text and snippet of code"

[13:35] *** melezhik_ left
[13:36] <disbot6> <antononcube> Well, that is Literate Programming (LP) and LP is important to many. E.g. data scientists.

[13:36] <disbot6> <antononcube> Most of which, of course, do not use Raku.

[13:39] <disbot6> <antononcube> BTW, Jupyter notebooks became more useful after Wolfram Research notebook patents started expired, and Google (and similar) really decided to adopt Jupyter notebooks.

[13:42] *** melezhik joined
[14:01] *** jgaz joined
[14:08] <Voldenet> I suppose in a lot of cases it probably would be beneficial to use them

[14:08] <Voldenet> and there's even docker image with all of it

[14:14] <disbot6> <antononcube> Yeah, I have to run/verify the Docker build and usage for "Jupyter::Chatbook".

[16:22] <[Coke]> Looks like we still need 8 articles?

[16:22] <[Coke]> Any IRC volunteers?

[16:22] <disbot6> <librasteve> yep ...

[16:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> (º_º)

[16:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> I can do a Number Theory in Raku review. But I am afraid I have too many articles in the avent calendar, though.

[16:40] *** abraxxa2 left
[16:51] <[Coke]> bah. I used to have a windows script that did the equivalent of "sw_vers" and I seem to have lost it.

[17:35] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube - you have 4 / 24 ... booked in which is a role model contribution, I would ask others to come forward now please to help us fill out the month ... we are still a couple of weeks out from Christmas eve, so folks still have time to crank one out and book in for the later dates...

[17:37] <disbot6> <antononcube> Agreed.

[17:38] <disbot6> <antononcube> But now I am thinking to make the "Number Theory in Raku Review" my 4th article.

[17:38] <[Coke]> recreated it here: https://github.com/coke/scripts/blob/master/win/sw_vers.ps1
