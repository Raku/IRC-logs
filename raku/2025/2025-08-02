[13:54] <arkiuat> I keep getting "Default constructor only takes named arguments" even though MyClass.^can('new') returns (new new), so the second multi method (which takes positional args) is there

[13:55] <arkiuat> although that's odd two, because I made two multi-method-news so in addition to the default named-parameter .new() there ought to be three in that listing

[13:55] <arkiuat> s/odd two/odd too/

[13:58] <arkiuat> oh, checking the .arity on the two .new methods, they both show .arity 1, so those are both named-parameter, both inherited. So at least I know that that neither of the multis I added are showing up in the call chain

[13:59] <arkiuat> Introspection is pretty cool

[16:46] <lizmat> arkiuat: if you can provide a gist re your .new issue, we could have a look to see what's wrong

[16:47] <arkiuat> if I don't find my own silly error while trying to golf it down to a single-issue snippet, I'll keep that in mind and post one for y'all. But I may not get a chance to work on this again until Monday or even Tuesday

[17:02] <lizmat> the problem in those cases is usually that the signature of your own .new doesn't match with what you think it should

[17:02] <lizmat> an easy test case is to temporarily remove the "multi" from the "multi method new" and see what error that generates

[20:18] <arkiuat>  lizmat: that's a great tip, thanks! it not only immediately revealed my problem here, but i've been stumped by this same error message before, and I bet it would've helped all of those times too

[20:18] <lizmat> you're very much welcome  :-)   been there, done that :-)

[20:20] <disbot4> <vendethiel> o/

[20:20] <disbot4> <vendethiel> m: my class A { has $!x; }; my $a = A.new(x => 10); my @a = A.^attributes; @a[0].get_value($a);

[20:20] <disbot4> <Raku eval>  

[20:21] <lizmat> m: my class A { has $!x; }; my $a = A.new(x => 10); my @a = A.^attributes; say @a[0].get_value($a);

[20:21] <disbot4> <vendethiel> is that meant to be possible? can I make it available?

[20:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e8d7f656: OUTPUT: «(Any)␤»

[20:21] <lizmat> m: my class A { has $.x; }; my $a = A.new(x => 10); my @a = A.^attributes; say @a[0].get_value($a);

[20:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e8d7f656: OUTPUT: «10␤»

[20:21] <lizmat> make it public?

[20:21] <lizmat> m: my class A { has $!x is built; }; my $a = A.new(x => 10); my @a = A.^attributes; say @a[0].get_value($a);

[20:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e8d7f656: OUTPUT: «10␤»

[20:21] <lizmat> or make it sure it's being built

[20:22] <disbot4> <vendethiel> I want to provide force-include/force-exclude is traits for my serialization module

[20:22] <disbot4> <vendethiel> I can forcefully call trait_mod:<is>($a, :built); I guess

[20:23] <disbot4> <vendethiel> thanks!

[20:25] <disbot4> <vendethiel> I need to read up on is built cause I don't remember anything about it

[20:39] <lizmat> basically it allows you to more options with regards to automatically creating accessors and/or accepting values to initialize with

[20:40] <lizmat> $!x is built    does not create an accessor .x   but it does allow you to initialize x with .new
