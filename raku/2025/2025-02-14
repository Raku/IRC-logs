[17:19] <lizmat> kmazza2 heredocs will be supported in the 2025.02 release of Rakudo

[17:20] <lizmat> if you can't wait for that, you can get https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/REPL 0.0.15 to get the same support now

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <kmazza2> Wow lizmat, you do great work for this community. Thank you so much ðŸ’¯

[21:29] <[Coke]> anyone know why https://github.com/jonathanstowe/META6/issues/31 might happen? in the test file all($foo.list) ~~ META6 fails, but testing each one individually works.

[21:39] <timo> didn't i recently see something about ACCEPTS on type objects with a custom implementation of ACCEPTS? and it depended upon whether the ACCEPTS method allows a type object as self or not?

[21:41] <timo> oh, there is no custom accepts involved there, is there

[21:42] <[Coke]> nope.
