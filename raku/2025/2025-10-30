[14:31] <disbot1> <m_zero> No please. Those characters are pictographs of ASCII control codes… and don’t carry the semantic meaning of substitute or translate.

[15:34] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve i have a very rudimentary question regarding Air::Component: how exactly is the state being stored per client? if multiple clients are connecting to a server running Cro, how are we making sure that each client isn't overriding the component state?

[18:11] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Agreed: "sub" could mean subroutine not substitute to the untrained eye. And most eyes are untrained!

[19:34] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine, what's the canonical way of adding LIMIT 10 to a SQL query in Red? Is it skip?

[19:36] *** librasteve_ joined
[19:37] <SmokeMachine> .head: 10

[19:38] <SmokeMachine> But, if you want a pagination, you may want .batch

[19:39] <SmokeMachine> The first example here: https://fco.github.io/Red/tutorials/cookbook.html

[19:40] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> oh no i'm not trying to paginate, i'm trying to return query results but limit it for a searchbox

[19:40] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> like a combobox autocomplete sort of thing: https://headlessui.com/v1/react/combobox

[19:41] <SmokeMachine> Then .head: 10 should do the trick for you

[19:41] <disbot1> <librasteve> arun: you probably saw this https://github.com/librasteve/Air-Examples/blob/main/bin/08-searchtable.raku

[19:42] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> yea i did, i was a bit reluctant to use the component role cause i wasn't sure how it handles state per client

[19:43] <disbot1> <librasteve> @aruniecrisps - good question on state - this current answer is "Air is HTMX oriented, like the ur-web, the server is stateless"

[19:44] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> right now i'm just using functional components to get the job done for the time being

[19:46] *** Sgeo left
[19:46] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine i searched the docs, it doesn't seem to be showing that .head can take an Int parameter, would you like me to add that to the docs?

[19:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> Air::Component is a wrapper on Cromponent from @SmokeMachine ... the latest version on Cromponent (not yet imtegrated with Air) supports secure routes (ie authentication to access method-routes) ... maybe this can help?

[19:48] *** Sgeo joined
[19:54] *** apac joined
[19:56] <SmokeMachine> Yes, that should be documented (the todo should have been become a documentation (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/a8c3cebd679eab3591a4f4e1cb8b97158a24c265/lib/Red/ResultSeq.rakumod#L318)). Could you open an issue to remind me to do that? (Or, if you prefer, a PR)

[20:00] <disbot1> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: - hi ... I see that the new Cromponent has auth traits in the source ... is there any example code for how this works?

[20:03] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, I’ll need to answer in a few hours…

[20:04] <disbot1> <librasteve> cool -tx

[20:06] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine i put up an issue for now. i've forked Red a long time ago so I'd have to basically re-fork it or fast-forward. if i have time i'll make a PR later
