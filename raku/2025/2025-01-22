[15:04] <[Coke]> I have a UPS and a generator, lost power for 30s yesterday, and my irc client machine loses my home directory disk whenever that happens. wtf.

[15:10] <lizmat> if it's an external disk, is it also on the UPS?

[15:17] <[Coke]> Y

[15:17] <[Coke]> I need to do a controlled power outage at some point (unplug the UPS) and see if I can figure out why this keeps happening

[15:20] <[Coke]> wonder if the UPS is busted, as I don't recall hearing the beep during the outage yesterday

[15:22] <lizmat> that could be...

[15:31] <jdv> 30s is a long time for a light duty ups that might have less capacity or battery life:|

[15:32] <jdv> that sucks though

[15:36] <ugexe> A lot of UPSs don't work well with non pure sine generators

[15:37] <ugexe> I have one that won't accept a charge at all when using such a generator (it just shows a fault), and another one that constantly flips on and off every 2 seconds

[15:40] <ugexe> you probably have a modified sine wave or some other dirtier power type generator

[15:41] <ugexe> i think you'd need a double conversion UPS to work with dirty power like that, but those are a bit more expensive

[15:42] <ugexe> all of this is assuming the UPS works as expected when you just unplug it. it is also entirely possible that the battery in your UPS no longer holds a charge

[18:29] <timo> lizmat: i'm wondering if runners and the run arguments should be decoupled or changeable or something like that?

[18:30] <timo> or maybe you can already give arguments in the runners array?

[18:31] <timo> or maybe you can combine multiple $coverage together if you need to run stuff differently and get one result out
