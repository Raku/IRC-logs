[13:53] <grondilu> why can't we put type constraints on `our` variables?

[13:53] <grondilu> m: package { our Int $foo }

[13:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 820a4a94a: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Cannot put a type constraint on an 'our'-scoped variable␤at <tmp>:1␤------> package { our Int $foo <HERE>}␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[13:54] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm not sure either

[13:58] <arkiuat> it's weird because you can put type constraints on `our` constants, no problem

[13:58] <arkiuat> but you can't constrain a constant without a type declarator

[14:03] <arkiuat> scope declarator, not type declarator, I meant

[14:12] <lizmat> I think the problem may be related to the fact that type constraints are implemented on the container descriptor

[14:14] <lizmat> so it would need to create container descriptor in the OUR:: stash for later use

[14:16] <lizmat> m: our $a; BEGIN dd OUR::.keys    # so why doesn't it do that ?

[14:37] <Geth> ¦ raku-mode: donaldh++ created pull request #64: Add highlighting for regex, rule, token

[14:37] <Geth> ¦ raku-mode: review: https://github.com/Raku/raku-mode/pull/64

[14:52] <disbot6> <antononcube> @lizmat I assume at some point you latest Raku advent article will be added here, https://github.com/lizmat/articles ?

[15:26] <lizmat> antononcube sorry, I wrote that one directly in WP

[15:26] <lizmat> I guess I could migrate back

[15:35] <disbot6> <antononcube> It is up you -- I want to use "real life" Markdown examples for an article on code streamlining code highlighting.

[17:55] <grondilu> what's up with docs.raku.org being so unresponsive?

[17:58] <lizmat> hmm... pretty blindingly fast for me...

[17:58] <lizmat> anything particular that's slow ?

[17:59] *** _________ left
[17:59] <timo> "waiting for docs.raku.org...", but from the same machine i can curl it and get a response immediately

[18:00] <timo> now i can get it with my browser too

[18:02] * lizmat is not seeing it

[18:02] <grondilu> I searched for "await" and did not get anything

[18:03] <lizmat> using the search box on the site?

[18:03] <lizmat> because that is all client side afaik

[18:03] <lizmat> is it not?

[18:05] <timo> yeah there's a "searchData.json" that gets downloaded up front with everything you need

[18:07] *** stanrifkin joined
[18:07] <timo> if for some reason that didn't load properly, maybe that broke your search

[19:22] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> lizmat: i don't know if you saw the gist that i sent earlier: https://gist.github.com/raiph/849a4a9d8875542fb86df2b2eda89296

[19:22] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> the first footnote states the following: "Of note, this primitive is Actor model "consistent", by which I mean it bundles behavior (code) and 100% private state (data), and cleanly enforces that consistency at every level, from the VMs Raku runs on to languages that target those VMs including Raku itself. One upshot is that the OO::Actors userland module is (at the time of writing this footnote) just 35 lines of code."

[19:23] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> i was wondering if you elaborate on what raiph means here? i'm kind of new to moarvm and would love to learn a bit more about the inner workings

[19:49] *** arkiuat left
[19:50] <korvo> I'm interested in a MoarVM-oriented answer, but I can give a capability-oriented answer as a complement. An actor is an encapsulated object, a mailbox for pending messages, and a system for referring to other actors at a distance by address. If every object is encapsulated and object references are hard to forge then it's easy to treat any object as an actor by attaching a mailbox.

[20:26] <grondilu> lol I guess I was totally wrong about Bag construction

[20:28] <grondilu> m: my $bag = bag foo => 1000000, bar => 0; print $bag.pick

[20:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 820a4a94a: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller bag(:bar(Int), :foo(Int)); none of these signatures matches:␤    ()␤    (*@a --> Bag:D)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 820a4a94a: OUTPUT: «foo foo foo bar foo foo foo foo bar bar»

[20:30] <grondilu> Isn't it supposed to apply some probability or something?

[20:31] <grondilu> ah nevermind again I'm wrong about bag construction

[20:31] <grondilu> m: my $bag = ("foo" => 1000000, "bar" => 0).Bag; print $bag.pick xx 10

[20:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 820a4a94a: OUTPUT: «foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo»
