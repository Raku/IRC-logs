[01:01] <guifa> huh

[01:02] <guifa> so I might have to retool a lot of how I'm doing this UI HTMLWindow

[01:04] <guifa> still investigating, but it looks like for some reason I can't seem to adequately call dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ ... } )

[11:40] <guifa> Ugh, I'm going to try spawning a separate process from my nativecall, and maybe then I can communicate via pipes with that.  I was hoping to avoid pipes tho lol

[12:07] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> is it possible to do a sequential "tap" of a Supply ? for example if I need to handle a first element from a supply, do some check, then get the second one if first one was ok etc. ?

[13:43] <disbot8> <antononcube> Can your Supply enumerate the chunks it emits?

[14:19] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> its the basic IO::Async::Socket with the Supply line by line

[14:22] <japhb> simon_sibl: You could coerce the Supply to a Channel to change the push semantics to pull ...

[14:32] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> ooooh nice one, thanks !!!
