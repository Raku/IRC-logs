[04:06] <wayland> .tell ugexe Thanks for the regex tip!  I started trying EVAL, but didn't get it working, and assumed there was an easier way.  

[04:06] <tellable6> wayland, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[04:09] <wayland> I also send kudos to the LLM people, because someday I'd like to make a too that's like nn8n/nodered, but with LLM, and maybe using tickets as well.  

[04:11] <wayland> jdv: I'm the regex expert where I work, and I'm not on either of the Developer teams :p (I'm DevOps)

[08:12] <wayland> Why is $y printing out as "Any", rather than Nil?  

[08:18] <Voldenet> >When assigned to a container, the Nil value (but not any subclass of Nil) will attempt to revert the container to its default value; if no such default is declared, Raku assumes Any.

[08:18] <Voldenet> (from https://docs.raku.org/type/Nil )

[08:19] <Voldenet> one way to fix it would be

[08:20] <Voldenet> m: sub te($x, $y is raw is copy = Nil) { say $y.raku ; say "$x, $y"; }; te(1)

[08:29] *** merp left
[08:40] <Voldenet> to be honest, Nil is overall a bit alien - I remember one convo about it (and its relation to "Failure" type) and it made me convinced that it's difficult to reason about

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i could use some help, please

[11:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am trying post -> { form-data -> ::?CLASS $form { ...  and get the error The form-data block parameter is of type ::?CLASS, which does not do the Cro::WebApp::Form role

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the post block is in a role and I want to make the class that does the role ("Contact") be applied as the form-data block param type

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if I go note ::?CLASS.^name; just before it says "Contact" so I guess I am close, but how to state it as a type on the param...???

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the docs is here https://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-webapp-form#The_routes if that helps

[11:30] *** jpn left
[11:39] <wayland> librasteve: I'm sure there's a reason, but why are you not just going   post -> { form-data -> Contact $form { ... 

[11:40] <wayland> Or, on the assumption that Contact does Cro::WebApp::Form, maybe   post -> { form-data -> Cro::WebApp::Form $form { ... 

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah … good question … i want to tuck away the route setup in a role rather than make every form class do it every time

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i suspect that raku can do that but i can’t work out the incantation

[15:35] *** Aedil joined
[15:35] <jdv> what does it mean?

[15:35] <El_Che> that alpine need extra header packages to build 

[15:35] <El_Che> that it does not need with 2025.03

[15:36] <El_Che> looking at this to figure out which: https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/contents?file=prctl.h&path=&name=&branch=v3.19&repo=main&arch=

[15:37] <jdv> https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/1056 ?

[15:40] <El_Che> I added the linux-header package, let's see if it finds the headers and continues

[15:41] <El_Che> I just build 2025.03 and that's why I notices the difference right away

[15:42] <El_Che> nope

[15:43] <El_Che> /usr/include/sys/prctl.h:88:8: error: redefinition of 'struct prctl_mm_map'

[15:43] <El_Che> so they do clash

[15:45] <El_Che> can we rollback the minimalloc version?

[15:57] <jdv> if we just wait it might be fixed by next release:)

[15:57] <El_Che> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/03e4fee65d1782f5aa7128d97169fb8601e4ac5b#diff-12a1f285dfd6eb8c98386c783f44c625dfc06db8fdb6f63fba703b1563f824ef

[15:57] <jdv> idk if its worth a point release - that'd be [Coke]'s call i guess

[15:58] <El_Che> minimalloc is explicitly bumped

[15:58] <El_Che> in 2025.04

[15:58] <El_Che> I think linux edge is wat most people on container use, I think a dotrelease with a rollback may be a good idea

[15:59] <jdv> what's linux edge?

[15:59] <El_Che> sorry

[15:59] <El_Che> alpine

[15:59] <jdv> [Coke]: ^

[15:59] <El_Che> edge is their dev release, but not related :)

[15:59] <El_Che> all alpines break

[15:59] <jdv> but they can still use 2025.03, no?

[16:00] <El_Che> sure

[16:00] <jdv> or do they auto upgrade their "edge" or whatever apk repo stuff?

[16:01] <El_Che> I don't think 2025.04 is in any repo yet

[16:24] <El_Che> I can try to downgrade mimalloc on moarvm while building, but it's better to have the release manager have a look so I don't break other stuff by downgrading

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> In one of Jonathan Worthington's presentations I heard the statement: Cro is a system for effectively building distributed systems.

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume Cro's primary type of a distributed system is a web application. Are there examples of using Cro for building other types?

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am trying to figure out can LLM services be utilized in more direct or easier manner using Cro's module/classes.

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Meaning, it would be possible or make sense to have classes like Cro::LLMApp and Cro::LLMSocket that are descendants of Cro::WebApp and Cro::WebSocket respectively.

[20:11] *** guifa joined
[20:16] <Voldenet> it's even said on homepage of cro

[20:16] <Voldenet> >Cro is a set of libraries for building reactive distributed systems,

[20:17] <Voldenet> and ZeroMQ support sort of hints at what's possible alread

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. Are there any concrete examples or plans for Cro-creations that are not web apps?

[20:28] <Voldenet> however I'm not sure it can be fully described as framework for distributed systems – it has no basic things like leader election, heartbeats, concept of nodes or sharding

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 💡 Thanks! I was hoping to hear observations or directions like this.

[20:30] <Voldenet> sure, it's possible to roll your own cluster singleton, but it might be difficult to practically implement reliably

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i’m more positive about cro as a distributed system toolkit … remember the name is my Cro xxx ie micro services … but sure it is not a framework with the stuff that voldenet mentions

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> it does provide tools to wire up multiple instances on different machines with channels connecting them and supports various protocols

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that said i am basing what i say on reading the docs … have not tried it and i’m not aware of any actual systems that use this

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... that is good to know at seems lower level from what I have in mind. It might be useful I try oranize LLM computations on, say, my own hardware.

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will be more specific. Currently the Raku LLM funcitonalities are very convenient for making (sequential) computational pipelines. Those pipelines correspond to (simple) "path graphs." I am considering making general graphs at the nodes of which different LLM- or deterministic computations happen. The computations are assumed asynchronous, hence different graph paths can taken at different execution times.

[20:42] *** guifa left
[20:44] <Voldenet> Channel and Supply can do a lot of work here

[20:44] <Voldenet> and cro can turn them into network processing tools

[20:45] *** guifa joined
[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this is pretty much all that is documented https://cro.raku.org/docs/cro-yml#Links … possibly you can map your graph onto these links / endpoints … then it is possible iirc to connect raku channels / supplies from one node to another

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but please take this with a rock of salt … i’m just guessing

[20:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think now that if I use Channel and Supply, then Cro is not that needed. I can just use the LLM functions implemented in Raku.

[20:49] <Voldenet> indeed, only when you need to use N machines or processes it starts making sense

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> A certain proof of concept using Channel, Supply, at nodes of graph structures might be a cool thing to do regardless.

[22:07] <wayland76> antononcube: Your LLM comments remind me of my plan to build a nodered/n8n workalike in raku.  If you haven't looked at them, have a look :) 

[22:08] <wayland76> Note: Feel free to take the idea and run with it

[22:09] <wayland76> (just let me know if you do)

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wayland76 Ok. Where, what link?

[22:29] <wayland76> The idea isn't written except in the #raku logs, and a failed attempt  that wouldn't be useful.  Nodered: https://nodered.org/   N8n: https://n8n.io/

[22:30] <wayland76> NodeRed is the free one, but there are a few ideas worth taking from n8n as well.  If you want an outline of my ideas, let me know, and I'll put something in a gist.  

[22:33] <wayland76> I'm not sure that LLM is involved in either, but the idea of hooking Cro to a set of Channels/Supplies is what I was thinking of.  

[22:35] <wayland76> My point was that such a system would be useful in LLM work.  

[22:36] <wayland76> Like my TOP ideas, I haven't done enough work on them for the ideas to be useful to others :)
