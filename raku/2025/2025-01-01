[17:54] <lizmat> hmmm

[17:55] <lizmat> the latter feels wrong

[18:03] <grondilu> I doubt its about casting though, as the line with a literal modulus works as expected.

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu Are you still interested in Raku-symbolics?

[18:05] <grondilu> well, it'd be useful to me but I'm not willing to put much effort into it these days.

[18:06] <grondilu> currently I'm working on a Reed-Solomon implementation so I need a Polynomial class that works with finite fields.

[18:07] <grondilu> the finite fields module I wrote some time ago is not as useful as I was hoping.

[18:08] <grondilu> I really wish I could redefine all arithmetics operators in the current lexical scope in just one line but I can't make it work.

[18:09] <grondilu> let alone having it to work with a module that was written for normal arithmetics, like Math::Polynomial

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Symbolics is a big field, and currently I am too busy (or should be) with certain numerics packages. And "Graph".

[18:15] <grondilu> well, I'm struggling rn to even get the long division work, even though there is code on rosettacode

[18:16] * grondilu realizes a mistake he made

[18:16] <grondilu> oh well at least now I see what I did wrong

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üí°

[18:17] <grondilu> I had actually reversed the coefficients of polynomials to fit the convention on RC, but that can't work unless I pad with zeros first.

[18:17] <grondilu> what a hassle

[18:18] <grondilu> so yeah, it'd be nice to have a good symbolics package.

[18:18] <grondilu> symbolic mathematics is underrated in programming IMHO

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, yeah!

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have been telling this to people for years. Non having symbolic computations handy is / was really restricting what you can compute.

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I expected this to become less important with LLMs evolution, though.

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (It is already.)

[18:22] <grondilu> Have you considered making an interface with maxima?

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No!!! üôÇ

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Mathematica is just fine for me.

[18:23] <grondilu> Mathematica is not FOSS, though.

[18:23] <grondilu> It's great, don't get me wrong, but it's just going to cause friction. 

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah. But my long term plan is to re-implement Mathematica in Raku. So, I much interested in having seemless Mathematica utilization in Raku in order to support that effort.

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> After RakuAST is released, that would be much easier. So, I am kind of in a waiting mode for that project. (I started it a few years ago.)

[18:25] <grondilu> Well, godspeed then.

[18:26] <grondilu> I wanted to do something like that too but it was way over my head.  I do remember that I concluded that RakuAST would help indeed.

[18:26] <grondilu> (only vaguely remember, though)

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ Thanks! I have been neglecting Mathematica projects in favor of Raku ones. So, again, I would rather deal or interface with Mathematica, out of guild, at least.

[18:27] <grondilu> have you looked into maxima at least a bit, though?

[18:27] <grondilu> I mean you don't want to reinvent the wheel

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I used maxima first 25+ years ago. Last time I looked into it was 3-5 years ago when I was looking for Raku enhancements.

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Honestly, it is too much like Mathematica and much "weaker" in any respect. So, I am not that interested investing in anything maxima-related.

[18:31] <grondilu> noted

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What, I was saying earlier about RakuAST for Mathematica -- look at this actions class: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Mathematica-Grammar

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I mean this link: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Mathematica-Grammar/blob/main/lib/Mathematica/Actions/Raku/FullForm.rakumod

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The idea is interpret Mathematica  expr into Raku code.

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Without RakuAST I can do just that -- generate text.

[18:35] <grondilu> Well you could generate raku lists, couldn't you?

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, that was my original idea or the attempt.

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, if Mathematica is "figured out" Raku-wise, that means that any similar system can be also "interfaced" in that way.

[18:37] <grondilu> I think it should also be possible to process Wolfram Language expressions directly and implement transformation rules with regexes substitutions.

[18:38] <grondilu> or use an intermediate language like S-Expressions or even lambda-calculus for that matter.  there's many ways to do it, but none of them is easy.

[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes! And the other way around -- Mathematica can process Raku expressions directly with both symbolic and numeric computations.

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again, I aggree -- that is why I implemented "Mathematica::Grammar". I have the S-expressions and symbolics in that way. I "just" have to have building of the corresponding Raku expressions.

[18:41] <grondilu> I'm not sure what these raku expressions would look like.

[18:41] <grondilu> It seems to me that we should stick to a textual representation bridge.

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "Ungly" code in NQP  or RakuAST style. üôÇ

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is what is more less happening here (wrt "textual representation bridge"): https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Proc::ZMQed

[18:42] *** sjn left
[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As, you say, if the Raku expression, say, ($x + $y)**2, is replaced with the equivalent Mathematica one, ($x + $y)^2 , then can get the Mathematica to symbolically evaluate and the value substitution on Raku's end.

[18:45] <grondilu> $x and $y would be undefined Numeric variables then, right?

[18:46] <grondilu> or (Any) I suppose

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah. But again, this a "text bridge". So, I get Raku expression back from Mathematica which I can just EVAL with concrete numeric values.

[18:47] <grondilu> m: class MathExpression {} ; multi prefix:<+>(Any:U $) { MathExpression.new }; say +my $x

[18:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar e7f9223c5: OUTPUT: ¬´Ambiguous call to 'prefix:<+>(Any)'; these signatures all match:‚ê§  (\a) from SETTING::src/core.c/Numeric.rakumod line 61‚ê§  (Any:U $) from <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[18:50] <grondilu> m: say +my $x

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> is default would make first one work

[18:51] * grondilu looks default trait in doc

[18:52] <grondilu> that seems like a different semantics

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> it would be a way to get decisive on the dispatch, i.e., I meant:

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> m: class MathExpression {} ; multi prefix:<+>(Any:U $) is default { MathExpression.new }; say +my $x

[18:53] <evalable6> nahita3882, rakudo-moar e7f9223c5: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot test e7f9223c59e70e9cd829b592bc3133322b82b3ab (Broken archive)¬ª

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  MathExpression.new 

[18:56] <grondilu> In any case ideally any CAS under raku should be a slang. IMHO.

[18:56] <grondilu> and these are NYI IIUC

[18:57] <grondilu> which is why I concluded that RakuAST would eventually help, I think.
