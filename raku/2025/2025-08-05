[12:01] <lizmat> weekly: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/491

[12:01] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[12:04] <disbot4> <antononcube> "DOM::Tiny" has not been updated for ‚âà6 years. Any recent experiences to report of how reliable or useful it is?

[12:05] *** arkiuat left
[12:06] <lizmat> in my experience Sterling Hanenkamp is a good author, so I'd say there's a good chance it's reliable

[12:06] <lizmat> I'm not sure about its usefulness though

[12:07] <disbot4> <antononcube> OK.

[12:07] <lizmat> it could use an update, if for the lack of using the Raku name :-)

[12:48] <disbot4> <librasteve> I nearly used DOM::Tiny yesterday (to read some HTML ^^) on the advice of an LLM ... but it failed to zef install so I ended up with quite a bloated HTML::Parser::XML => XML chain ... would fill a gap between fast and dirty getting eg a table as values and precision XML parsing

[12:53] <lizmat> ah, seems to have been reported recently: https://github.com/zostay/raku-DOM-Tiny/issues/19

[12:54] <disbot4> <librasteve> yeah sorry was too lazy to raise an issue

[12:54] <disbot4> <antononcube> @librasteve I will make html-table-data-extraction available in "Data::Translators".

[12:56] <disbot4> <librasteve> that'd be cool - I'm actually going to lean in to LLM a bit on this hobby project

[12:59] <disbot4> <antononcube> See the MVP here: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Data-Translators/blob/main/experiments/HTML-table-data-extraction.raku

[13:01] <disbot4> <librasteve> nice!

[13:01] *** arkiuat joined
[13:01] <disbot4> <antononcube> No dependencies, just regexes.

[13:02] <disbot4> <antononcube> I need to make it more robust and write tests for it.

[13:02] <disbot4> <librasteve> feature request to specify which table (if > 1 on the page) either by table class="xxx" or by just an index (0,1,2,...)

[13:04] <disbot4> <antononcube> Hmm... that is on the robust side, I think: if no header spec is found then indexes re used.

[13:06] *** arkiuat left
[13:12] <disbot4> <antononcube> Agh, no, you are asking for something (much) more.

[13:15] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @librasteve https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/769560/227738

[13:16] <disbot4> <librasteve> LLM must have been trained on that then

[13:18] <disbot4> <antononcube> Yeah but you cam always add to the prompt: > use only built-in functionalities, do not use 3rd party modules.

[13:19] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> Right. LLMs are the world's greatest plagiarists.

[13:22] <disbot4> <antononcube> More importantly, in that answer, did you parrot the statistical parrots yourself?

[13:26] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube I don't use LLMs. I taught myself Raku by solving Unix&Linux StackExchange problems. Some I solved de novo. For others I translated awk and perl one-liners into Raku code.

[13:27] <disbot4> <antononcube> I will stage some (LLM) tests to verify that claim...

[13:28] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> Do your worst (best)! ü§£

[13:29] <disbot4> <antononcube> This actually, is a hard problem, both methodologically and technically, with Raku code.

[13:30] <disbot4> <antononcube> I refer to the obvious chicken and egg question.

[13:30] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> "Dear LLM, please prove your plagiarism of StackExchange Raku code. Thx."

[13:31] <disbot4> <antononcube> The other part, is for being able to ingest stack-exchange posts/answers of a particular user.

[13:32] <disbot4> <antononcube> I think that latter one was recently discussed here...

[13:34] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> No egg-and-chicken. My first Raku answer posted on U&L StackExchange was in 202. What LLMs were around then? https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/581448/227738

[13:35] <disbot4> <antononcube> Yeah, but this one is post LLM-revolution.

[13:35] *** arkiuat joined
[13:38] <disbot4> <antononcube> Honestly, gathering those answers might make a nice book(lette).

[13:38] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> Are you seriously suggesting that an LLM installed and tested SEVEN Raku modules to come up with a verifiable StackExchange answer?

[13:39] <disbot4> <antononcube> This is the so called programming language LLM-plugins do/did since 2023.

[13:40] *** arkiuat left
[13:41] <disbot4> <antononcube> For Python it is done by default, always. As far as know, by OpenAI, and I assume others. (Gemini, Claude, etc.)

[13:43] <disbot4> <antononcube> But, I doubt it is done for Raku.

[13:44] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> I'd love to see you test it, Anton. Along the way I'd love for you to discover the idiosyncratic phases I use when posting my Raku answers, such as "...formerly known as Perl_6".

[13:45] *** apac left
[13:45] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube Wouldn't it be funny if you get better LLM answers asking for one-liner code written in Perl_6 rather than Perl6? ‚ÄºÔ∏è ‚ùì

[13:49] <disbot4> <antononcube> These sort of small changes should not matter that much with "serious" LLMs.

[13:50] <disbot4> <antononcube> The problem with many LLMs is the same as with Raku -- there is no argument for specifying a random seed when the queries are made. Hence, how to make this kind of experiments.

[14:46] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> ChatGPT still doesn't know Coq has been renamed to Rocq. Hopefully the situation is better with Raku, which was renamed much earlier

[14:47] *** arkiuat left
[14:50] <tonyo> .

[14:50] <ugexe> the problem with chatgpt is it always refers to raku as "Raku (formerly Perl6)"

[14:53] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> I tried to teach it that Coq is now named Rocq, it saved it to its memory

[14:53] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> But then it claimed to me when I used the term "Rocq" that it has been renamed into Coq

[14:56] <disbot4> <antononcube> Yeah, the same with "Wolfram language, formally known as Mathematica."
