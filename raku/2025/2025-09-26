[00:51] <leont> ab5tract: I think I comprehend it, I'm just not sure how to make it work with NativeCall (and metaclasses, but that's a secondary concern)

[01:09] *** apac left
[01:26] <leont> NativeCall is a high level API, and this feels like it needs a lower level API (or perhaps a differently shaped one); RakuAST might be the solution though. I have a rough idea of how to do this.

[08:00] <ab5tract> That could be really interesting. Let me know if you want some help!

[08:01] <ab5tract> RakuAST will definitely come in hand when building idiomatic Raku classes to wrap all the generated NativeCall stuff
