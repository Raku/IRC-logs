[11:02] <disbot6> <librasteve> arkuiat: yeah, that struck me too - but my conclusion is different ... the purpose of this strapline is to drive interest through engagement { to pick three well know ones Nike => Just Do It [wtf does that mean?], Apple => Think Different [ie we are not IBM], De Beers => Diamonds Are Forever {physically strong or  love is eternal] } --- it only working if there is an emotional response and that means some kind of resonating

[11:02] <disbot6> dissonance

[11:03] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> "Code Different"

[11:04] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> "Deeply Expressive"

[11:04] <disbot6> <librasteve> in our case this means "code in the style you like / that fits the job" AND "this nutty language was designed by a (lazy) linguist and has hooks in it that are designed to engage the bits of your brain that workk with natural language - <my our has with without andthen ...>

[11:08] <disbot6> <librasteve> @jubilatious1_98524 ... well yes --- I like your ideas because they also align to the message of expressive and  multi-paradigm ... but I prefer "works the way you think"  ;-)

[11:09] <disbot6> <librasteve> @sjoshuan  - is there enough real estate on your beermat to fit "works the way you think"?

[11:10] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @sjoshuan Do you mean 2026 sticker? And does "Deeply Expressive" fit on your beermat? 😃

[11:11] <disbot6> <librasteve> https://chatgpt.com/share/68eb8cb8-bcd4-8009-89ce-6670170a593e

[11:13] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> You're basically asking ChatGPT it's opinion of your slogan. Try instead: "Raku programming language ELI5"

[11:13] <Voldenet> jubilatious1_98524: nah, categorize is more fit for this particular use case

[11:14] <disbot6> <librasteve> @jubilatious1_98524 - we spent a fair bit of time bikeshedding the strapline for the new raku.org website ... https://github.com/librasteve/raku-org-25-proto/issues/14 ... at your request I reopened this discussion issue since I think its fair to keep this open and to evolve it - but tbh it was hard enough to get agreement on the one we chose (so if you want to propose a change, the onus is on you to achieve a concensus on the

[11:14] <disbot6> new thing)

[11:15] <disbot6> <librasteve> in the meantime, I am proposing that our schlotke for Fosdem is consistent with our current agreed strapline

[11:16] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Voldenet not very memorable... "categorize" versus "classify". Are programmers just supposed to memorize it?

[11:16] <disbot6> <librasteve> (if it will physicall fit)

[11:17] <Voldenet> Yes, for me classify is somewhat memorable, categorize I have to look up

[11:17] <Voldenet> i like C#'s "groupBy" (like classify) but there's no alternative for "categorize"

[11:17] *** arkiuat joined
[11:17] <Voldenet> i guess "GroupByMany" would be C# naming

[11:18] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Voldenet so yo remembered "classify" was going to give you a weird Empty-string as key?

[11:18] <Voldenet> classify is not doing that

[11:18] <Voldenet> classify will die if you attempt to do that

[11:19] <Voldenet> the empty key is coming from `orelse ""`

[11:19] <Voldenet> you can set it to Nil or anything else

[11:19] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Voldenet see my most recent: && $0.Str // ""

[11:20] *** lichtkind joined
[11:21] <disbot6> <librasteve> the ChatGPT I shared was not so much that I bow to ChatGPTs opinion, but that its response is pretty much in line with my thoughts on the underlying (actually quite technical) rationale behind "works the way you think"   ...

[11:21] <Voldenet> yeah, you explicitly say to get empty key :)

[11:22] *** arkiuat left
[11:23] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> I can set it to Nil but I still don't want it appearing in my output. That's why I still want a :skip-empty adverb.

[11:24] <Voldenet> use .categorize

[11:25] <Voldenet> and that's it

[11:25] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> But I'll have to read over the Docs on categorize and classify to see it they make sense to me.

[11:25] <Voldenet> basically, categorize accepts 0..n categories

[11:25] <Voldenet> so you can have element in 0 or many keys

[11:25] <Voldenet> classify accepts exactly 1

[11:26] <Voldenet> in this case 0 or 1, which is exactly your use case

[11:26] <Voldenet> so there's not going to be :skip-empty

[11:26] <Voldenet> timtowtdi could say that it can be useful…

[11:28] <Voldenet> but it'd be an alias for existing method mostly

[11:28] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Your original classify code output 3 categories: old_, older_ and oldest_. Not sure where you're getting "classify accepts exactly 1" from.

[11:29] <Voldenet> I mean, classify returns one category from every block invoked

[11:29] <Voldenet> categorize returns many

[11:30] <Voldenet> m: (1..10).classify({ [.is-prime, $_ %% 2 ]}).say # note that it creates nested tree with exact category path

[11:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9c5fc915f: OUTPUT: «{False => {False => [1 9], True => [4 6 8 10]}, True => {False => [3 5 7], True => [2]}}␤»

[11:30] <Voldenet> m: (1..10).categorize({ [.is-prime, $_ %% 2 ]}).say # this only returns 2 bools, so some things will get both categories

[11:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9c5fc915f: OUTPUT: «{False => [1 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10], True => [2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10]}␤»

[11:30] <Voldenet> also note duplicated elements

[11:31] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> So classify was designed to choke on non-matching criteria?

[11:34] <Voldenet> Yes

[11:36] *** ds7832 left

[12:54] <disbot6> <librasteve> I would like to use a module and then to turn around an reexport all its symbols in the new module -- what is the best way to do this?

[12:55] *** librasteve_ joined
[12:59] <lizmat> librasteve there's no simple generic solution, especially if the symbols aren't packages or subs

[13:00] <lizmat> https://docs.raku.org/syntax/sub%20EXPORT

[13:01] <lizmat> in other words: create a sub EXPORT that lives in the compunit's scope  (so no unit class Foo, but class Foo { }  sub EXPORT ...)

[13:01] <lizmat> which should return a Map with the things you want to export

[13:01] <disbot6> <librasteve> .oO

[13:02] <disbot6> <librasteve> looks like i can work with that

[13:02] <disbot6> <librasteve> many thanks!

[13:03] <lizmat> note that sub EXPORT can also be a multi, if you want to pass positional arguments to it

[13:04] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/String-Utils/blob/main/lib/String/Utils.rakumod#L660-L676 is an example of an EXPORT sub that takes the names of subs to be exported

[13:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> OK - so the subs I got down OK .... how about the role / class declarations ...?

[13:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> I got << role Script does Tag[Regular] is export {...} >> and I want to move the code from Air::Base to Air::Base::Tags ...

[13:13] <disbot6> <librasteve> but still expose the role to those who go use Air::Base in their code

[13:13] <disbot6> <librasteve> without having to go for a FQN

[13:19] *** arkiuat joined
[13:22] <lizmat> roles can be exported without the & prefix

[13:24] *** arkiuat left
[13:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> so something like Map.new( 'Script' => Air::Base::Tags::Script ) ??

[13:35] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh - just 'Script' => Script, lol
