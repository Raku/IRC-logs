[01:10] <Voldenet> actually don't use augment in grammars, it's bad

[01:10] <Voldenet> actions are elegant, but I like the inline style

[01:10] <Voldenet> m: grammar :: { rule TOP { \d+ <?{ $/.make($/.Int) }> }}.parse("42").made.say

[01:15] <Voldenet> nevermind, I read the question it was related to, actions are the way to go

[02:13] <wayland> Voldenet: I was looking at using augment on the Match, so that it would have an additional attribute.

[02:15] <wayland> I like the idea of it being an action; I'll have to investigate the actions object that's paired with the Raku grammar.

[12:09] <tbrowder> note to self: chdir does NOT change location of the running program--super duh!!

[12:14] <tbrowder> in the docs it says do this to really 'cd': temp $*CWD; &*chdir('/tmp');

[12:15] <tbrowder> i assume the '/tmp' could be any valid path, yes?

[12:16] <tbrowder> m: temp $*CWD; &*chdir('/usr');

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar be3d06a71: ( no output )

[12:18] <tbrowder> m: temp $*CWD; &*chdir('/usr'); say $*CWD

[12:18] <tbrowder> üëè

[12:21] <tbrowder> m: my f($dir) {temp $*CWD; &*chdir($dir); say $*CWD;}; f "/usr/bin"

[12:26] <tbrowder> excellent! why not add a mult or method to chdir to really change directories?

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland: imo Grammar Actions are the way to go with make/made ... there is a lot going on with grammars backtracking and so on that otherwise can make very thorny issues

[13:58] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to wayland

[15:15] <lichtkind_> are there any feature cmparsons 6c vs 6d ? thank you

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lichtkind: I guess the most likely place to look is the 6d release notes on the rakudo github repo

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <lichtkind> librasteve: thank you

[15:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yw ... it's been a long time since I heard the name 6c
