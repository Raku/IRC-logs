[04:10] <notable6> SmokeMachine, Noted! (weekly)

[04:10] <tellable6> 2025-04-12T03:03:40Z #raku <Xliff> SmokeMachine Yes, but translate is a mouthful, given the number of nodes it has to cover. I'll see if there are any not covered by the existing alpha MySQL driver.

[04:12] <SmokeMachine> .tell Xliff in theory, CommonSQL driver should handle most of (if not all) of them...

[04:12] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[14:27] <SmokeMachine> Hi! If anyone would like to give me their opinions: https://dev.to/fco/a-raku-cromponent-to-render-highlighted-code-powered-by-rakuast-2dhn

[14:46] <[Coke]> SmokeMachine: I would suggest showing a screen shot of some of the formatted code.

[14:46] <tellable6> 2025-04-14T13:48:38Z #raku-dev <finanalyst> [Coke] i just sent you an email

[14:49] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: That makes sense… I added on README, but I forgot to add on the post. Good idea, thanks!

[14:51] <SmokeMachine> I don’t think it got very pretty… I just choose random colors… but because the user can create a css file an add any color they want, I think that’s ok for now…

[14:56] *** lichtkind joined
[14:57] <[Coke]> If you didn't mention that you can customize the colors, maybe add that too.

[15:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I just caught you RakuCode post - this is AWESOME(!) - thanks for making this. It makes it even more vital that Air can consume Cromponents since otherwise I will have to write it myself (actually I was considering Rainbow - but I was thinking that RakuAST in the mix meant that this would need to change down the line, RakuCode looks like a home run to me.

[15:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this is a term used in Rounders btw

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have a couple of thoughts relating to Cromponent in general.

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Would you be amenable to moving Cromponent into the Cro organisation as a Cro repo? Why? Well I think Cromponent is the clear choice for Cro components and to my mind it makes sense for it to be part of the Cro ecosystem. Anyway, your call. If you are happy then we can propose to add you to the Cro org members too. Obviously if you are in agreement then we can take the idea to the "powers that be" to get their

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> approval.

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Second, unrelated thought. I am thinking that there would be many Cromponents in the future and that from a module curation point of view, it would make sense to call them names like Cromponent::Table or Cromponent::RakuCode or Cromponent::BaseLib::Widget::LightDark ... this is really just obsessive and preemptive tidyness creeping in - so again just an idea.

[17:22] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: hi, thanks. I’m still not sure about RakuCode because it does not show YOUR code, but the deparsed version of your code’ RakuAST… so, for example, your indentation will probably be messed up (as my example on README was), if you use &[+] it will be replaced with &infix:<+>, etc… but I think that’s a good start at least…

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh, I see - the use cases I have in mind would be eg for raku documentation, so that notches RakuCode down a peg - nice all the same!

[17:27] <SmokeMachine> I wouldn’t oppose to move cromponents to Cro organisation, but is yous suggestion for the organisation only or also the namespace? Are you suggesting something like Cro::Cromponent? In that case I would probably change its name to something like Cro::Component, or to maintain the joke: Cro::mponet (that doesn’t look good… on my mind it “sounded” better…). But I don’t like Cro::Cromponent

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> are there any unambiguously good reasons to have highlit RakuAST (eg would that be a handy tool to illustrate RakuAST "how tos" maybe?

[17:29] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: sorry, I couldn’t understand your RakuAST question…

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I agree that both Cro::Component and Cro::Mponent would be (much) worse than Cromponent - so (looks at org dashboard page) suggest repo name is cromponent and the modules name stays Cromponent

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> If https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg is supported? I am helping rocky Linux team with installing Rakudo via conventional way of rpm packages . I see the last commit is 3 months ago, and probably does not include the latest versions

[17:31] <SmokeMachine> About Cromponent::* components, I think that’s would work, but maybe too long to be used on templates…

[17:34] <SmokeMachine> And Cromponent already have “native” components with no Cromponent:: prefix: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/tree/main/lib of course it can be changed… but that’s how it is now…

[17:34] *** jpn left
[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lemme rephrase more bluntly - RakuCode is not suitable for code highlighting, so would be a bad choice for a raku examples webpage, however it is ideal where you are working with RakuASt, for example a webpage that does XXXX <== is this phrase true for some XXXX, would you say it is true for XXXX == a webpage that shows examples of how to use RakuAST

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> or maybe some other XXXX?

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - take example StyledDiv I suggest to put the StyledDiv.rakumod file inside the Cromponent directory and namespace it as Cromponent::StyledDiv ... that's really not too long in the context of other Cro names - Cro::WebApp::Template for example

[17:38] <SmokeMachine> I think I should rename RakuCode to something like RakuASTCode… but I’m not sure yet…

[17:39] <SmokeMachine> I feel that too long to: <:use Cromponent::Boilerplate>

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well would be nice to have actual code highlighting based on Rainbow ;-) and that's gonna need a name also]

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: these are just suggestions from me - I 100% trust your instincts and decisions - but I do suggest you think about a future with 100s of cromponents ... maybe in libraries - the raku use and module management system is great for sharing, bundling and packaging - but the day you release any new module, its name is frozen for ever ... so if we get an extensible pattern now we maye have to deprecate a

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> handful of module names, but then the namespace will be cleaner for you and for other cromponent authors

[17:44] <patrickb> SmokeMachine: Are you aware of the RakuAST based syntax highlighter lizmat and finanalyst developed?

[17:44] <patrickb> If not I think it'd be a good idea to get in contact, so you can learn from their experience.

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> * well that s 86401 secs

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrickb: ++

[17:48] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: do you mean DEPARSE accepting a role for highlighting? If so, yes and I use it… otherwise: no and if you could send a link, I’ll take a look…

[19:04] <patrickb> I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's it. Finanalyst built a highlighter around this. He used it for a while on docs.raku.org.
