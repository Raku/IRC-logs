[10:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: thank you for the excellent improvements to crag (released as v0.0.25) much much faster thanks to precomp and lovely repl mode

[10:22] <lizmat> you're very much welcome: it also made me improve CodeUnit, so that's a win-win  :-)

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> one day I will get around to trying to Slangify crag ... stuff like 17.5cm is pretty much there anyway through exports of SI units and prefix combos - so the goal would be to be able to go literally my $lumber-length = 12.5 ft * 42 for any literal number-string sequence "in the wild" where the Slang extends the raku Grammar and checks the Str part for parseable units, also  12.5 ft ±3%.

[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> .tell librasteve: https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/168#issuecomment-2880483378 there are more interesting details on cro test issue , also confirmed by few people from rocky Linux team that try to install cro . Somehow it relates to zef install logic as well , which is most interesting bit . I managed to reproduce the bug myself and found workaround which is weird

[16:25] <tellable6> melezhik., I'll pass your message to librasteve

[21:14] <tonyo> getting close, testing the emails, about ready to use fez locally for managing dists

[21:15] <tonyo> and then you should be able to upgrade, or your tooling can upgrade its deps to fez 100+ and you'll start getting instant index/feedback

[21:16] <tonyo> a true up job will run every night to support legacy clients for a few months and then i'll turn off the old stuff

[21:16] <tonyo> also added an AST query module it seems
