[00:21] <lizmat> ab5tract: that would get hairy in the case of multis and also a bit action at a distance

[00:21] <lizmat> also, this feels like "wantarray" like context, and we don't want to go there

[08:22] <ab5tract> I guess so. To me it feels like putting a hard distinction between fat arrow and colonpair everywhere is a case of YAGNI

[08:23] <ab5tract> maybe YMAGNI - you mostly ain’t gonna need it

[08:25] *** yewscion_ left
[08:25] <ab5tract> We probably don’t have any reasonable syntax left over but it might feel cleaner to introduce an always-positional-Pair syntax instead of repurposing an existing one

[08:26] *** jpn joined
[08:30] <ab5tract> Anyway, I support fixing this regardless because it does feel like an unfortunate gap in functionality as it currently stands

[11:47] <lizmat> thanks!

[11:49] <lizmat> interesting: the offending module is now a raku community module, so looks like we could just fix that, and then re-apply  :-)

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @melezhik. Trying to get DeepSeek to generate Mermaid-JS code from the SparrowDo ASCII diagram:

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The result is good, BTW, given how misaligned the ASCII diagram is in its chat-box.

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I got an email to participate in this challenge because they "came across" of my GitHub project "Raku-WWW-LLaMA" : https://www.readytensor.ai/agentic-ai-2025/ .

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure is that just a marketing ploy or something more serious.

[17:25] <[Coke]> Hopefully the IRC intro to Raku is smoother than it was for perl back in the day.
