[03:41] <Voldenet> that new LogicTernary is nice, but `True3 Unknown3 False3` would be better defaults

[03:41] <Voldenet> so all things exported by ternary contains 3, it's very obvious

[03:42] <Voldenet> it's just my opinion though

[03:42] <Voldenet> I've been struggling with "5 types of enum with the same name" a lot

[03:46] <Voldenet> in fact, in C# I've been struggling with enums with exactly the same but different namespaces

[03:46] <Voldenet> the same name*

[03:47] <Voldenet> though that's inevitable

[08:07] <disbot1> <librasteve> o/

[08:08] <disbot1> <librasteve> is ,= supposed to work?

[08:09] <Voldenet> but it works, doesn't it

[08:09] <Voldenet> m: my $x = 4; $x ,= 5; say $x

[08:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\List_6095617942944 = (List_6095617942944 5))␤»

[08:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\Array_3301976132616 = [Array_3301976132616 (4 5)])␤»

[08:09] <librasteve_> yeah that seems like a bug to me

[08:10] <Voldenet> m: my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; say @numbers = @numbers, (4, 5);

[08:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\Array_3427642784496 = [Array_3427642784496 (4 5)])␤»

[08:10] <Voldenet> the output is exactly the same though

[08:11] <librasteve_> I excpet the outcome to be [1,2,3,4,5]

[08:11] <librasteve_> for both

[08:11] *** arkiuat joined
[08:12] <Voldenet> m: my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; say @numbers = |@numbers, (4, 5); # like this?

[08:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3 (4 5)]␤»

[08:13] <Voldenet> but having this would prevent you from constructing list of lists

[08:13] <librasteve_> no

[08:13] <librasteve_> m: my %a = :11a, :22b; %a ,= :33x; say %a;

[08:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «{a => 11, b => 22, x => 33}␤»

[08:13] <librasteve_> well it works for Hashs

[08:13] <librasteve_> but not for Lists or Arrays

[08:14] <librasteve_> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#postfix_,=

[08:15] <SmokeMachine> m: my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; say @numbers = |@numbers, |(4, 5)

[08:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3 4 5]␤»

[08:16] *** arkiuat left
[08:16] <Voldenet> m: my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; say @numbers .= append: 4, 5

[08:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3 4 5]␤»

[08:17] <SmokeMachine> m: my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; say @numbers ,= |(4, 5); say @numbers

[08:20] <Voldenet> you'd need to somehow slip the @numbers into numbers

[08:21] <Voldenet> iirc there's more differences between Hash/Array - like .Hash doesn't clone but .Array does for example

[08:21] <librasteve_> but it works with Hash … so seems like a bug to me

[08:21] <Voldenet> I'm not even sure if they should work the same

[08:21] <librasteve_> my point is that the intent is the same with Hash and List and Array

[08:22] <Voldenet> however, it'd require changing how , operator behaves

[08:22] <Voldenet> and it sounds dangerous

[08:23] <Voldenet> because suddenly @c = (@a, @b) would autoslip its arguments

[08:23] <librasteve_> ok - lets say we keep it how it is - please give me an example to show how it works with Array (the most obvious situation) that does involve say dumping the Array_ident

[08:23] <librasteve_> s/does/doesn’t/

[08:24] <librasteve_> i’m synpathetic that this

[08:24] <Voldenet> though I agree that the result with @c = (@c, @b) is a bit weird and I am not sure what it'd be useful for

[08:25] <librasteve_> say (%(:a(0)), %(:b(1)))

[08:25] <evalable6> librasteve_, rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «({a => 0} {b => 1})␤»

[08:26] <Voldenet> but the , op doesn't know if it's invoked with syntax `@c = (@c, @b)` or `@c ,= @b`, does it?

[08:26] <librasteve_> what i mean to say is that Im sympathetic that `,`works differently with Hash than Array (ie no slip stuff)

[08:26] *** melezhik_ joined
[08:27] <Voldenet> Not really - in hash case first value doesn't contain any key at all

[08:27] <Voldenet> in array case first values doesn't need any index

[08:27] <librasteve_> sorry not explaining myself very well - snippet coming

[08:28] <Voldenet> I mean, in hash case `%x = (%x, :34x)` pretty obviously doesn't ask hash to nest hash as its value

[08:29] <Voldenet> m: my %x = :33y; %x = (%x, :34z); say %x # obvious

[08:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «{y => 33, z => 34}␤»

[08:29] <Voldenet> m: my %x = :33y; %x = (:%x, :34z); say %x # also obvious, similar to list case

[08:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\Hash_4498526920320 = {x => Hash_4498526920320, z => 34})␤»

[08:30] <Voldenet> the problem with , is that it is always used to construct new list

[08:30] <Voldenet> and all the operands are elements of the new list

[08:35] *** arkiuat joined
[08:37] <librasteve_> ok I guess I get it … missed opportunity imo … but I’m not gonna ask to redefine the language

[08:38] <Voldenet> yeah, I think it would've been better if list construction needed first array as item

[08:38] <Voldenet> e.g @c = (\@c, @b)

[08:39] <Voldenet> it'd solve this particular case and prevent this :(

[08:40] *** arkiuat left
[08:40] <Voldenet> in fact, I'd do @numbers.push: 4, 5

[08:40] <Voldenet> not as short, but not lengthy either

[11:23] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I like the default to "override" the logic. But your argument of all exports have 3... what is your other people's opinion?

[11:50] <Voldenet> SmokeMachine: the overriding kinda works, but you have to remember to use it, I like KnownTrue, KnownFalse and Unknown for being very obvious, but "just add 3 to everything if you need ternary" makes this very obvious

[11:50] <Voldenet> I mean, you have to read the manual to understand what True3 does

[11:50] <Voldenet> it's not obvious…

[11:51] <Voldenet> but once you do, every single thing just having '3' postfix is sane

[11:51] <Voldenet> and immediately visible when you read the code

[11:56] *** lizmat left
[11:58] <Voldenet> jubilatious1_98524: If I had to put it into words - arrays/lists are stricter - .Array always copies, ,= will nest. On the other hand .Hash only coerces (not copies) and ,= doesn't nest things

[12:00] <Voldenet> and also this behavior is container-dependant

[12:00] <Voldenet> m: my %l = :1a; %l ,= :2b; say %l # understandable

[12:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «{a => 1, b => 2}␤»

[12:00] <Voldenet> m: my $l = :1a; $l ,= :2b; say $l # uhhhh???

[12:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\List_4530704967216 = (List_4530704967216 b => 2))␤»

[12:02] <Voldenet> well in that case :1a is just a pair, so to make sure

[12:02] <Voldenet> m: my $l = (:1a).Hash; $l ,= :1b; say $l

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\List_4517452484112 = (List_4517452484112 b => 1))␤»

[12:02] <SmokeMachine> m: my $l = %(:1a); $l ,= :2b; say $l

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(\List_4613851695696 = (List_4613851695696 b => 2))␤»

[12:02] <Voldenet> It's… surprising if you don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

[12:06] <SmokeMachine> m: my $l = %(:1a); %($l) ,= :2b; say $l

[12:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «{a => 1, b => 2}␤»

[12:06] <SmokeMachine> m: my $l = :1a; %($l) ,= :2b; say $l

[12:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «a => 1␤»

[12:06] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @SmokeMachine overriding logic is difficult without some way to introspect which logic is being followed.

[12:07] *** arkiuat joined
[12:07] <SmokeMachine> you can just `dd True` and see if it prints Bool::True or Logic::Ternary::True

[12:09] <SmokeMachine> or `True ~~ Logic::Ternary`...

[12:09] <SmokeMachine> jubilatious1_98524:

[12:11] *** arkiuat left
[12:11] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @SmokeMachine The R programming language uses TRUE, FALSE, and NA.  Maybe you could try True-na, False-na,  and NA.

[12:13] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> (@SmokeMachine:I don't understand the distinction between Unknown and Nil here. If there is no distinction then Nil is probably better).

[12:13] <SmokeMachine> why na? and now you can use whatever you want, you can just do `use Logic::Ternary <True-na NA False-na>` and it will work the way you want

[12:14] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> That sounds pretty cool.

[19:34] <disbot1> <librasteve> ha - now I try in vi on my local machine it works too! must have been something wrong in my incantation to summon v6.e

[19:35] <disbot1> <librasteve> glad to see it is working!

[20:46] <thowe> libresteve, OK.  the address parsing thing has come back around to my radar and I have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole with it.  In the US there is some new data formats being adopted as part of the NG 911 initiative.  Maybe we can chat sometime about it...  Actually awaiting some info from Oregon state about a thing.  Anyway.

[20:47] <thowe> I may have a need to do some tooling for my GIS stuff.  If so, that will involve a lot of different states.

[20:50] <librasteve_> thowe: cool - my general idea is that Raku could benefit from an address parser that works at scale using Grammars … and since Grammars are classes, then we can start with a very general one and then override specifics to accord with country / state / language specific conventions

[20:51] <librasteve_> I kinda started to sketch this out with https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Contact/tree/main

[20:53] <librasteve_> please can you take a look and see if your general approach would align with that? - perhaps the code you already worked on would be a more robust version of that?

[20:54] <librasteve_> sorry … I am turning in for the night, but feel free to start a discussion (eg as an issue on that repo…) - maybe you can also point me to the code you have already

[20:54] <librasteve_> &afk for now

[20:58] <thowe> Yeah.  A Grammar is what I am after...  It may need some additional bells and whistles.  I doubt my code will be the base, but maybe can help inform requirements.  I'm a barely functional hobbyist.
