[12:01] <tbrowder> hi, i tried to "like" antononcube's article but couldn't it's way over my head but i think it's pointing out the power and beauty of Raku grammar should be a huge selling point to non-Raku ppl.

[17:50] <Voldenet> while it's not directly a proof, I see inheritance used more in performance contexts in C#

[17:50] <Voldenet> so it might just be that class at some point became faster

[17:51] <Voldenet> OR role was implemented later

[17:52] <Voldenet> though to me it's obvious that Cool meant to represent "abstract type being either Str or Int or whatever else perl used to have"

[17:54] <Voldenet> and not some behavior

[17:54] <ugexe>  "Cool is a class (and not a role), because classes are mutable; so if you want to inject behavior into nearly all built-in types, augmenting Cool is an option (though usually considered evil, and should not be done lightly)."

[17:54] <ugexe> from https://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/cool.html

[17:56] <tadzik> Any's the "whatever Perl used to have" type, iirc

[17:56] <Voldenet> ah, so Cool is an afterthought because there was too much mess in Any

[17:57] <Voldenet> very nice post

[19:14] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> The first footnote says that Raku and MoarVM bundle private state and behavior at every level, I was wondering how this is enforced at the VM level?

[19:16] <librasteve_> arkuiat: good question, I often refer to the docs typegraphs (eg https://docs.raku.org/assets/typegraphs/Int.svg) … it feels to me that class and role are used for different purposes - and that the class is the primary (singly) inherited parent all the way up to Cool - Any - Mu

[20:33] * grondilu got the infamous 'Missing serialize REPR function for REPR CStruct (Raylib::Bindings::Color)' error today

[20:34] <grondilu> when trying something simple like initializing a color :  `{ use Raylib::Bindings; constant white = Color.init(255, 255, 255, 255); }`

[20:34] *** melezhik left
[20:35] <grondilu> it works fine outside of a function.  I'll try to golf it.

[20:37] <grondilu> actually it does work in a function too.  I guess it's more about integration into a module or something.

[20:37] <grondilu> which somehow gives me a deja-vu vibe.

[20:37] <grondilu> I vaguely recall lizmat having looked into something similar years ago

[20:39] * grondilu notices the IRC logs are not searchable?

[20:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> Switch to using Discord, so, you can search.

[20:44] <grondilu> turns out it's quite easy to golf: https://gist.github.com/grondilu/7053364a823a0ca35bb572429d24b957

[20:46] <grondilu> The module can run just fine, but not if I import it with -M

[20:47] <grondilu> not sure about use Foo in the code though.  I'll try.

[20:47] <grondilu> nope, `use Foo; Foo::f()` fails exactly the same way.

[20:48] * grondilu tries to connect to discord

[20:50] * grondilu notices he can clone the irc-log repo

[20:50] * grondilu gives up on connecting to discord

[20:52] <lizmat> grondilu: you mean at irclogs.rakyu.org  ?    works fine as far as I can see

[20:53] <arkiuat> grondilu: nice! The irc logs search works for me, but I've always found the interface a little clumsy, so I should try that

[20:53] <lizmat> *irclogs.raku.org

[20:56] <lizmat> wrt search interface: suggestions welcome!

[20:58] <Voldenet> grondilu: fwiw raylib bindings export colors

[20:58] <Voldenet> https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/main/lib/Raylib/Bindings.rakumod#L1022

[20:58] <Voldenet> …it's done in quite weird way

[21:01] <grondilu> I've tried using colors directly but that did not work.

[21:01] <grondilu> oh, I see.  With a `init-` prefix?

[21:02] <lizmat> weird indeed

[21:02] <Voldenet> otoh examples use `my $white = Color.init(245, 245, 245, 255);` instead

[21:04] <grondilu> oh maybe I can't use Color.init to define a constant, as it's compile time or something?

[21:05] * grondilu checked if replacing constant with my fixes it, and it does

[21:05] <Voldenet> hm, Color.init does malloc-Color

[21:09] <Voldenet> so obviously it won't work because the pointer totally isn't constant
