[12:03] <librasteve_> and SG is all concentrated into certain dates (seems to have subsided now)

[12:10] <librasteve_> it’s quite interesting to see that the site gets about 100 unique visitors / day on average and that about 6% go to the Install page … wonder if there’s a way to get rakubrew download stats to correlate?

[16:38] <tbrowder> ok,

[16:40] *** arkiuat joined
[16:42] <tbrowder> that last advent post by antononcube is something that would help to attract new coders--as  they say

[16:42] <tbrowder> good job!!

[16:44] <disbot7> <antononcube> Thank you! I was considering inscribing "2026" or snowflake(s) onto the mazes but that is too much work. (Both to program and to explain.)

[16:45] *** arkiuat left
[16:45] <disbot7> <antononcube> So, I opted to just generate an image of a raccoon in snow-covered maze.

[16:45] <tbrowder> anyone know how to do that with Python? a comparison of the two methods would make a good pitch for Raku

[16:46] *** arkiuat joined
[16:46] <tbrowder> using more that

[16:47] <tbrowder> *than core packages

[16:49] <disbot7> <antononcube> Well, Python has interfaces to powerful graph librararies written in C and C++. So programming the core ideas is not that hard. What would be hard it the graph plotting and finding geometric nearest neighbors. For the latter, most likely some of the big Machine Learning (ML) libraries have to be used.

[16:49] <tbrowder> maybe when i get the PS snow flake code public it can help-your pic is very nice as is is

[16:50] <disbot7> <antononcube> The problem is making a large enough maze over the vertices on which to project a word or a snowflake.

[16:50] <disbot7> <antononcube> Even if that is done the maze itself might too hard to solve or too messy to look at.

[16:51] <disbot7> <antononcube> Meaning, a fair amount of experimentation has to be done in order to produces good results.

[16:51] <disbot7> <antononcube> (Which I decided, is too time consuming.)

[16:55] <tbrowder> oh, i see, i was thinking you meant snowflakes falling...but still, mine may be useful--lizmat and librasteve and jmerelo see them on our Christmas poem

[16:57] <korvo> tbrowder: Finding spanning trees isn't in Python's stdlib, but everything else is. Graphs are usually represented as an adjacency structure.

[16:58] <tbrowder> only equal hexagonal pieces of filled traiangular and rectangular areas, no curved lines

[16:58] *** arkiuat left
[16:59] <disbot7> <antononcube> I have plans to hook igraph (https://igraph.org) to Raku. That C-library has interfaces Python, R, and Wolfram Language.

[17:00] <disbot7> <antononcube> @korvo It is not just the spanning tree finding. There are fair amount of "convinience" functions that have to be in place too. (The maze making.)

[17:01] <korvo> antononcube: Sure, precisely reproducing that blog post with Python would be a chore. However, I don't think that that's a good comparison of languages.

[17:01] <disbot7> <antononcube> For example, subgraph, graph union, finding neighborhood graphs, etc.

[17:01] <korvo> TBH if y'all were to invest into a fast Raku then you could handily beat Python just by advertising speed. CPython is notoriously slow and its maintainers aren't interested in making it structurally faster.

[17:01] *** arkiuat joined
[17:02] <korvo> ...To be *too* honest, I'm mostly blocked on thinking up a good name for Raku in RPython, or NQP in RPython, but I'm willing to do the JIT parts.

[17:02] <disbot7> <antononcube> The maze making blog post can be more or less precisely translated to Wolfram Language (WL).

[17:03] <disbot7> <antononcube> I was planning to do that today, but I started doing some surface fitting with WL...

[17:04] <disbot7> <antononcube> @korvo Related to your language comparsion point -- that is a good reason to "igraph"-based implementations. They can transfered easily between Python, R, and WL.

[17:05] <korvo> I suppose. That sounds completely uninteresting to me, but I can understand why people would want it. FWIW as one of the igraph maintainers for nixpkgs I would recommend against it; it works but it's brittle and unsafe.

[17:06] <korvo> Similarly, basic operations like subgraphs or unions are done with one-liners. Python has comprehensions (from Setl, I think) and it's not hard to build a new adjacency structure from old ones.

[17:07] <disbot7> <antononcube> Interesting point about the brittleness of "igraph" !

[17:08] <disbot7> <antononcube> No, subgraphs and unions are not one liners.

[17:10] *** arkiuat left
[17:13] <disbot7> <antononcube> @korvo Do you know any published discussion on the brittleness of "igraph" ?

[17:13] <disbot7> <antononcube> I am very interested in reasons not to use it.

[17:20] *** arkiuat joined
[17:20] *** Chris3101 joined
[17:28] <korvo> Nope. It's just the opinion of one distro maintainer who had to use it for a while.

[17:37] <disbot7> <antononcube> Ok.

[17:41] <timo> korvo: are you interested in looking at moarvm's specializer and JIT compiler?

[17:42] <korvo> timo: A little. However, I specialize in RPython. (The other option out there is GNU Lightning, which can be much faster if it aligns with the high-level language.)

[17:43] <korvo> My next RPython project is planned to be a uxn interpreter. I could be persuaded to do something else.

[17:45] <timo> neat. i was also quite into pypy a couple of years ago

[17:47] <korvo> I'm all-in on RPython. I've looked into the options and I think that it's the best power-size ratio of the JIT compilers. I have a Nix flake with quite a few RPython interpreters available: https://github.com/rpypkgs/rpypkgs

[17:49] <timo> whole-program type-inferrence is definitely interesting, and fully automatic root finding is convenient

[17:51] <timo> i assume that also means you're not that interested in going down to the assembly level?

[17:53] <korvo> I can do assembly, but not for free. Do you have a list of goals or tasks somewhere? TBH I usually have to be personally motivated by having hardware on hand, which usually leads to a relationship with a vendor willing to ship me the hardware in question. But I've written e.g. GPU drivers and embedded ARM drivers.

[17:54] <korvo> FWIW my Raku experience on amd64 has been that it is *fast enough* for my purposes, particularly when it comes to parsing. I'm satisfied already.

[17:56] <timo> i don't exactly have a task in mind, really just offering to answer questions or show you around if you wanted to tinker

[17:56] <timo> the bigger wins in performance are probably not in the emission of machine code but in making the specializer able to do more powerful analysis and transformations

[17:57] <korvo> I am somewhat interested in knowing what the lowest portable substrate is; NQP, MoarVM bytecode, or something else? Even ignoring my personal work for a moment, I gather that Raku is a specification given by a pile of executable tests, and also that there's currently only one implementation passing those tests. It'd be good to know the natural layer from which to start a second implementation.

[17:59] <timo> building something that runs NQP is probably a good start if you want to reuse big chunks of rakudo?

[18:00] <timo> but if you're willing to not reuse a lot, you can go straight for a Raku compiler and ignore NQP entirely

[18:01] <korvo> Both Raku and NQP seem like enormous targets. For NQP, that's mostly due to pre-specialized bytecodes; could those be unspecialized for a slower interpreter with less code, or is there a philosophy to it?

[18:01] <timo> on moar we turn both nqp and raku code into moar bytecode and that is interoperable, so a function or method written in one can call the other and vice versa

[18:02] <timo> how do you mean "pre-specialized bytecodes"? are you refering to the nqp::blah stuff you see in the code?

[18:02] <korvo> Yeah. Like, the bytecodes correspond to type information from the input language rather than the hardware target.

[18:04] <timo> you're at the level of moar bytecode right now?

[18:04] *** vrurg_ joined
[18:04] <timo> i'm not sure if you mean things like atpos_i or things like extend_u8 or whatever

[18:04] *** Staff_Virgil left
[18:05] <korvo> I'm looking at NQP, I think. Specifically https://github.com/Raku/nqp/blob/main/docs/ops.markdown

[18:05] *** vrurg left
[18:07] <timo> ok, a bunch of moarvm opcodes are exposed as `nqp::blabla(...)` function-like things to be used in nqp as well as raku code

[18:08] <timo> you'll want to know a little bit about the metamodel, especially REPRs, to really make sense of that stuff I think

[18:09] <korvo> Basically, I'd like to know what the minimal collection of ops actually is. I'm used to Self-style VMs that have maybe a dozen ops: lookup local by name, create closure/object, prepare/pack message, call immediate, send deferred.

[18:11] <korvo> Generating hundreds of type-specialized ops is possible; e.g. Faster CPython does it as part of their JIT strategy. If that's the case then I'm interested in how they're currently generated because any RPython codegen would have the same shape.

[18:12] <timo> i'm not sure anything stops you from making everything related to reprs behave more like method calls, then that would move stuff from the ops namespace to a real namespace visible to the language

[18:13] <timo> moarvm gained a "syscall" mechanism where you can call something by its name with different callsites if you like, and a good portion of the ops in moarvm could easily be moved to that mechanism if the right shaped tuit appears

[18:14] <timo> it does encode to bigger bytecode though, and is probably a bit slower to dispatch

[18:14] <timo> so that would be fine for things your code doesn't have to do tens of thousands of times a second, like "get attribute from object" or "add two integers"

[18:15] <timo> ^- "wouldn't be fine"*

[18:15] <korvo> I suppose I'm a little surprised that there's not a single bytecode-caching mechanism like in Python or OCaml. I feel like perhaps there was a design goal of making MoarVM have that shape, but I didn't find a single document that says how to load and interpret a precompiled bytecode file.

[18:16] <timo> we do store precompilation results, the classes related to CompUnitRepo are responsible for all that machinery

[18:16] *** Chris3101 left
[18:16] <timo> the bytecode files that we precompile can't run completely on their own, they need a rakudo already loaded around them

[18:16] <korvo> That sort of named-syscall dispatch would be fine in RPython. RPython costs are based on what the JIT can and cannot remove; there's no big difference between a constant string lookup in a dict vs. a constant index lookup in a list, for example.

[18:17] <timo> right, it deeply traces stuff

[18:17] <korvo> Ah, okay. More like CL's FASL and less like OCaml's bytecode, sounds like. FASL is prelinked somewhat with the CL runtime.

[18:18] <timo> yeah our bytecode files refer to objects and types in bytecode files they depend on by an index in their tables, making the dependency extremely tight

[18:19] <korvo> Given the list of NQP ops -- threads, Unicode, I/O, floats, nativecall -- it seems like it *should* be possible to bootstrap any sort of HLL just from bytecode.

[18:19] <timo> you mean building a set of .moarvm files that runs, for example, python code?

[18:20] <korvo> Oh! Okay, I've seen this pattern before. It arises in e.g. Capn Proto; the Capn Proto algorithm is fully documented *except* for the precise mapping of names to indices, which is withheld in order to force users to depend on the official Capn compiler.

[18:20] *** bwani54 joined
[18:20] <korvo> Sure, that's a possibility. I would work on the other side of that API barrier, implementing an alternative VM that faithfully runs .moarvm files.

[18:21] <timo> unfortunately, the serialized blob inside moarvm files isn't specified by anything other than moarvm's source code, and the serialization format doesn't describe itself either

[18:22] <timo> but there's nothing stopping you from writing out something different from .moarvm files, it's all written in nqp code except where it asks moar to "please dump the serialized blob now"

[18:23] <timo> nqp-moarvm was used to compile the compiler and runtime for nqp-js by adding a different output stage in the compiler pipeline

[18:23] <korvo> That's what I gathered. At that point, it seems like RPython might as well be a target. And at *that* point, I'd ask whether we might as well have QBE (or LLVM, I guess) as a target!

[18:23] <timo> then when nqp-js was fully featured enough it could compile itself, at least if i remember correctly

[18:24] <korvo> RPython has much nicer support for threads and Unicode than QBE. It doesn't have exactly the same object model as any HLL, but it can easily emulate them and there's a straightforward recipe for doing it.

[18:24] <timo> i don't know what QBE is though

[18:25] <korvo> Oh, sorry. Quick BackEnd. Like LLVM but smaller and much much simpler. https://c9x.me/compile/

[18:25] <korvo> RPython, QBE, and LLVM all share the principle that one ought to be able to generate human-readable text and feed it directly into the backend to generate a native executable.

[18:26] <timo> OK

[18:29] <korvo> timo: Anyway, thanks for humoring me. It's a fun thought experiment.

[18:29] <timo> regarding your question of how moarvm does specialization, I'd probably direct you to jnthn's talks. I believe "How does deoptimization help us go faster?" is one of the talks that has a good overview of the specializer at the start: https://jnthn.net/slides.html this has slides and also video recordings

[18:30] *** bwani54 left
[18:31] <timo> in short, many operations record information at run time, and there's a specializer thread that collects that stuff, figures out what frames are worthwhile to make a specialized variant of based on, for example, incoming arguments, and then it can make assumptions with deoptimization guards and such

[18:31] <timo> it works in an SSA form with BBs that you've probably seen thousands of times before

[18:32] <timo> "Giving MoarVM a new general dispatch mechanism to speed up various slow Raku constructs" shows our new dispatch system that is practically required if you want to get the more complex interactions of features like multiple dispatch with "nextsame" working in your own implementation

[18:33] <timo> (but is also nice for performance)

[18:35] *** Aedil joined
[18:37] <timo> oh, and the NQP And Rakudo Internals Workshop material is probably also very valuable, even though it was at a time when moarvm was brand new

[18:37] <korvo> timo: Okay. That sort of cycle is definitely the sort of thing that I'd like to fully absorb in RPython rather than reify; RPython's internals are fairly close to that, with the biggest difference being how the JIT interacts with threads.

[18:38] <korvo> How meta is the metainterp? Can the NQP toolchain be asked to compile itself to a backend?

[18:38] <timo> you can probably benefit from small polymorhpic inline caches in your version of bytecode

[18:40] <timo> so far it hasn't been necessary to use the nqp built for one backend to compile to a different backend except for the initial bootstrap, so i'm not sure if the necessary stuff is exposed like with CLI flags or something

[18:40] <timo> but nqp does compile itself to *a* backend every time you build it :P

[18:41] <korvo> Well, it's just that it sounds like it'd be easier to not write one NQP interpreter in RPython, but instead write an NQP backend that can compile any input to RPython, and then generate an NQP JIT as a special case.

[18:42] <korvo> Inline caches are curious. Once the JIT's paths get hot enough, it's often cheaper to ask the JIT to do a linear search for methods when it is tracing and let the JIT memorize the results of that search. An example from my Monte language, a flavor of E: https://github.com/monte-language/typhon/blob/92d70fbcbe1291f1aa7c5cedca90345b8a95f6cc/typhon/nano/interp.py#L168-L183

[18:43] <korvo> I notice that all of the backends seem to have three levels of interaction: HLL, NQP, QAST. All are required?

[18:44] <timo> i'm not exactly sure what you mean by that

[18:44] <timo> QAST is the datastructure we work with that's relatively close to the target, but still abstract enough to mostly generalize, with an escape hatch if it's needed

[18:47] <timo> QAST is very tree-shaped, the next step in the pipeline for moarvm would be MAST which is much more linear and refers to things like labels and registers, whereas QAST has local variables and ops like "if" that have condition and different branches just as children

[18:47] <timo> but i'm not sure how HLL and NQP fit into this list

[18:50] <timo> there's a bunch of differences between a piece of code compiled to a raku sub or method and the same for nqp: different type objects are used for Code / Routine / Method, the "hll" is set to a different one on the underlying code object, the roughly same code in raku vs nqp is compiled differently because the languages have different semantics, and when calling between different HLLs like nqp vs raku

[18:50] <timo> there's hllization of common objects like Array, Capture, etc

[18:50] <korvo> I'm just trying to understand what a backend should be shaped like. Is it possible to work only with QAST, or is that escape hatch regularly required?

[18:52] <timo> you can work only with QAST with the caveat that you would put objects in there as well which is how they get to become serialized and make it from the compiler's environment and re-appear fully formed in the target program

[18:53] <timo> long long ago before bounded serialization was a thing, rakudo would spend a big chunk of time at startup creating all the classes and such by calling metaobject methods for everything

[18:54] <korvo> Hm. I figure that it's unavoidable to have a pre-written RPython class which represents "user" objects; the code for a user object is 100% live and must be JIT'd. But there's also "prebuilt" objects and various ways of setting them up so that they're translated and baked into the executable.

[18:54] <korvo> There's also, as in the RPython implementation of SOM Smalltalk, the ability to directly save a bytecode file as a string in the executable.

[18:54] <timo> i'm not sure what level of meta we are at right now

[18:55] <timo> moarvm offers a very simple REPR and metaobject that has very simple attributes and a very simple method table called KnowHOW

[18:55] <korvo> I'm still thinking about replacing MoarVM only. Specifically thinking of an NQP backend which emits RPython.

[18:56] <timo> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/e4192c660f11473d1f5ca638e06b5ad0bc7ad029/src/6model/bootstrap.c#L290

[18:56] <korvo> Yeah. I'm familiar with Piumarta, Warth, et al and I know how to write that sort of core metaobject. I'm still learning Raku's metamodel but fortunately there's a battery of specification tests that will force me to get it right.

[18:57] <timo> is that the paper about the CLOS?

[18:57] <korvo> Yeah. COLA, Pepsi, etc.

[18:58] <korvo> That C looks quite familiar. Somebody's gotta populate a vtable somewhere. The alternative would be something like E-style auditors, where the knot is tied based on the ability to prove that an object is immutable; the stamp of immutability must itself be immutable.

[18:59] <korvo> https://github.com/monte-language/typhon/blob/92d70fbcbe1291f1aa7c5cedca90345b8a95f6cc/typhon/objects/auditors.py#L37-L40

[18:59] <timo> i am not familiar with any of that

[19:00] <timo> but yeah, building this kind of thing is always fun. bring your circularity saw!

[20:07] <disbot7> <librasteve> wonders if Raku could target LLVM and notes that the JVM is quite complete, but has lacked the same amount of resource as MOARVM

[20:09] <[Coke]> ah, it's the biannual "hey, why don't we target LLVM?" question!

[20:09] <[Coke]> I cannot remember how to arrive at the answer, but I'm pretty sure the answer has been "it's not as easy or helpful as you might think"

[20:11] <korvo> I'd hope that you don't think that I actually asked that.
