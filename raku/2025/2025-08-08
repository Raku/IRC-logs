[00:37] <SmokeMachine> .tell librasteve_  I made a change on Red, and now you can use functions receiving 2 parameters to do the polymorphic stuff... it will use the join-model internally... I still need some ironing on the code, but here is the MR: https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/585

[00:37] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[00:38] <SmokeMachine> .tell librasteve_ it allows us to do that with a code like this: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uv1dvAkV/

[00:38] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[00:39] <SmokeMachine> .tell librasteve_ that will print this: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/hD7a36wO/

[00:39] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[00:46] <SmokeMachine> The code is a mess… I really need to refactor that…

[01:43] <Voldenet> refactoring is needed so technical debt doesn't grow, technical debt reduces productivity by 20% annually and constantly refactoring only by 95%

[01:44] <Voldenet> so by using these good quality guesstimated statistics, productivity is reduced by 95% after 14 years, therefore refactoring is good ;)

[19:30] <arkiuat> I'm wondering why it was decided to not make DateTime a value type.

[19:31] <arkiuat> m: say DateTime.new(2025,8,8,20,23,0) eqv DateTime.new(2025,8,8,14,23,0,timezone => -6*60*60).in-timezone(0)

[19:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3aea31ed1: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:31] <arkiuat> m: say DateTime.new(2025,8,8,20,23,0) === DateTime.new(2025,8,8,14,23,0,timezone => -6*60*60).in-timezone(0)

[19:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3aea31ed1: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[19:32] <lizmat> m: use v6.*; say DateTime.now.WHICH

[19:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3aea31ed1: OUTPUT: «DateTime|5566103909040␤»

[19:32] <lizmat> hmmm

[19:33] <lizmat> didn't we have this discussion recently ?

[19:33] <lizmat> aaah... https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5933

[19:34] <arkiuat> wow, I completely missed that. Glad you're already on top of the situation!

[19:34] <lizmat> merged, thanks for the nudge

[19:34] <lizmat> should be in the next release :-)

[19:34] <arkiuat> fabulous

[19:34] <lizmat> m: use v6.*; say DateTime.now.WHICH
