[06:51] <disbot8> <librasteve> @jubilatious1_98524 - you will note that the notable6 robot did not acknowledge your "weekly:" command - for a few weeks now it has only worked if you use on the IRC side of the bridge - so I will not see it when I run the weekly summary - please can you raise an issue for this with the bot maintainers (personally I run IRCcloud (an app) in parallel with Discord but I understand this is inconvenient)

[11:58] <tbrowder> hi, i've been blathering on the beginner chan by mistake. i can use "mkdir" here but not on my local host.

[11:59] <tbrowder> m: my $d = mkdir "t";

[11:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56482941: ( no output )

[12:00] <tbrowder> on my host i "no such method 'mkdir' for string "t/data"

[12:02] <disbot8> <librasteve> raku -e 'mkdir "t";'

[12:02] <disbot8> <librasteve> raku -e 'mkdir "t/data";'

[12:02] <disbot8> <librasteve> ^^ these both work on my machine

[12:03] <disbot8> <nahita3882> error suggests you are doing "t/data".mkdir

[12:05] <disbot8> <nahita3882> mkdir $str or $str.&mkdir or $str.IO.mkdir works

[12:06] <tbrowder> mine too, but i'm trying to use it inside a raku test script. i know i've done it in the past, but maybe i have to use /tmp or a module that creates a temp file

[12:08] <tbrowder> trying another tweak...

[12:13] <tbrowder> hm, got it to work *without* the assignment. why would that work here and not on my host?

[12:14] <tbrowder> this worked on my host: mkdir $path

[12:15] <tbrowder> but this did not: my $dir = mkdir $path

[12:16] <tbrowder> rakudo 2025.06

[12:16] <tbrowder> m: raku -v

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56482941: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routines:␤    raku used at line 1␤    v used at line 1␤␤»

[12:18] <tbrowder> anyway, mine is 2025.06.1

[12:45] *** apogee_ntv joined
[13:15] <tbrowder> i’ll chk for any pertinent rakudo chngs…

[13:22] <tbrowder> unless version here is diff, same as mine. must be an ENV thing

[13:23] <tbrowder> sweet mystery of Raku

[17:03] <[Coke]> (different hosts) - if you're not doing the equivalent of "mkdir -p" you might have an existing intermediate directory on one machine (that works) and not the other (that doesn't)

[17:03] <[Coke]> (or permissions on one of them)

[17:04] <[Coke]> ah, scratch that, mkdir says it does -p semantics by default. So maybe permissions?

[17:04] <[Coke]> also, if there's an exception, you should get some details in the message body:

[17:04] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/type/X/IO/Mkdir

[17:07] <ugexe> tbrowder>	on my host i "no such method 'mkdir' for string "t/data"

[17:07] <ugexe> <nahita3882> error suggests you are doing "t/data".mkdir

[17:08] <[Coke]> ah, I missed that and focused on "works on one, not on another". yah, you need to .IO that first.
