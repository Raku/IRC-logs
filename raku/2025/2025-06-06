[17:14] <wayland76> Question: has anyone tried the editor called "Zed"?  https://zed.dev/

[17:18] <disbot1> <librasteve> nope … i use vi and intellij so not really room for a new one … does it have raku support?

[17:30] <wayland76> That's why I'm asking :) .  

[17:35] <wayland76> OK, I think I've managed to answer my own question: It'll please the minimalists, and has its good points ( https://fuelyourdigital.com/post/is-zed-better-than-vs-code/ ), but raku users probably aren't minimalists :p 

[17:35] <disbot1> <librasteve> my vague memory last time i looked at raku code highlighting was that we should try and make a raku LSP (Language Server Protocol?) since it appeared that this single piece could work with IntelliJ (and their new prototype), vscode and maybe others. I gather that Rainbow is the state of the art for raku code highlighting written in raku.

[17:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> vi is pretty minimal … it took years for me to warm to coloured code text though

[17:40] <wayland76> Yeah, agreed, vi is minimal.  I've recently switched from nano (which I'd still choose remotely) to vscode, but if there's a better alternative, I'd like to hear it.  If it does good AI suggestions and handles git worktrees (as well as Raku, obviously), I'm interested.  

[17:40] <wayland76> And yes, agreed about the LSP.  

[17:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> i tend to stay away from ai code completion… intellij plus the raku plugin 2.0 is as good as you can get for full fat raku IDE right now … i hear that vscode and intellij are pretty level on git and llm integration …

[17:49] <wayland76> We've been using GitHub Copilot at work (PHP), and it's right often enough that I'm coding faster.  Also we've gotten CodeRabbit, which I think has been doing an amazing job reviewing PRs.  Not sure how it'll do with Raku though.  

[17:50] *** Aedil left
[17:59] <wayland76> My boss likes CodeRabbit because it generates a summary of what the PR is attempting to achieve, which means he doesn't have to read through the code to figure it out, and I like it because it makes a bunch of recommendations that are mostly useful, and even when they're not, it's usually "That's a good idea, but not at this stage of the project"

[18:40] <[Coke]> folks - what is the URL for the RSC site?

[18:40] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/229

[19:01] <disbot1> <antononcube> Nothing beats using Raku in Wolfram Notebooks!!!

[19:01] <disbot1> <antononcube> Well, maybe, using Raku-Jupyter chatbooks...

[19:02] <disbot1> <antononcube> IntelliJ for writing Raku packages is really hard to beat.

[19:11] <[Coke]> anyone ever have to deal with cleaning up fsck errors in a git repo? https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/50

[19:17] *** abraxxa-home joined
[19:37] <disbot1> <holmdunc> the Zed editor is powered by Tree-Sitter (created by the same folks). If there were a Raku Tree-Sitter grammar it could power syntax-highlighting and navigation in Zed (and Emacs, Neovim, ...)

[19:41] <disbot1> <librasteve> @holmdunc - ah yes, I forgot that part - seems to be some JetBrains TreeSitter work ... https://github.com/JetBrains/jsitter

[19:45] <disbot1> <holmdunc> Nice. It's unfortunate that VScode, being the extremely popular editor theses days, doesn't really have anything to do with Tree-sitter. So there can be no big unification

[20:37] <[Coke]> is there anyway to introspect what -I was set to?

[20:41] <ugexe> raku -I foo -e 'use lib "bar"; say Rakudo::Internals.INCLUDE'

[20:41] <ugexe> (foo)

[20:42] <ugexe> just be sure you don't also need libraries included with `use lib ...`

[20:43] <ugexe> generally i think people want to know what the non-default repositories are so they can include them when they spawn a new process using $*EXECUTABLE

[20:45] *** yewscion left
[20:57] *** apac joined
[21:43] *** abraxxa-home left
[21:48] <[Coke]> I wrote a test that is using an executable - so RAKULIB=. is currently needed as zef test . is using -I (right?) - I will attempt to rewrite it to avoid needing that (will have to manipulate @ARGS by hand)

[21:52] <[Coke]> timo: git rebase --root -i

[21:52] <timo> aha!

[22:00] <[Coke]> root *is* special. :)

[22:18] <ugexe> technically you shouldn't have to distinguish between if something is using -I., RAKULIB=., or use lib "."

[22:18] <ugexe> like the fact zef uses -I. is an implementation detail

[22:18] <ugexe> but yeah there isn't a great way to handle this

[22:21] <ugexe> I think I usually do like `run($*EXECUTABLE, $*REPO.repo-chain.map({ ("-I", $_.path-spec).Slip }), '-e', ...)` but that isn't exactly perfect either since it means all the default repos are listed twice and probably ends up doing extra precompiling

[22:22] <ugexe> although with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5338 that solution would be mostly sufficient since we could then disable the default repos in the spawned process and thus there wouldnt be dupes

[22:23] <ugexe> i guess there would still be dupes for the non CURI-based repos
