[07:07] <grondilu> Hello.  A state variable doesn't seem to get initialized properly when using the -n option.

[07:08] <grondilu> quite difficult to show here, but just run `$ cal |raku -ne 'say (state Int $sum = 0)'`

[07:10] <grondilu> FYI I wanted to compute the cumulated sum of a file with a bunch of numbers per line.

[07:11] <grondilu> so something like `raku -ne 'state Int $sum = 0; say $sum; $sum+=$_'`

[08:16] <melezhik> grondilu: ooo - what do you expect to see when run $ cal |raku -ne 'say (state Int $sum = 0)' ?

[08:20] <melezhik> so looks like it produces a lot of (Int) , when should produce a lot of 0 ?

[09:10] <lizmat> there used to be, I think... probably better asked on #raku-doc

[13:13] <melezhik> Hi community! sparky.sparrowhub.ci goes for alfa testing , anyone could spin up test for their repo, just 1) login using raku/raku as cress 2) follow https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/build/project/new-project and enter your favorite Raku module repo 3) submit - within minute you'll get it added to the system 4) pickup badge.txt if you like it and add it to module's README 5) Thanks ) ☺️ 

[13:13] *** yewscion joined
[13:13] <melezhik> cress -> creds 

[13:14] <melezhik> should be module source control repo, for example - https://github.com/bduggan/raku-map-leaflet

[13:14] <melezhik> badges are collected via module build page report, artifacts -> badge.txt 

[13:15] <melezhik> current Rakudo version to test again is 2025.02

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I think making an LLM-based recommender for emojis is a good exercise and it should be done. I am looking for a more robust solution though withe more deterministic methods.

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, LLMs can be used to derive for each emoji a description and corresponding search queries. Then Latent Semantice Analisys (LSA) is applied. Classical LSA, using matrix factorization, cannot be done easily with Raku currently, but LSA factorizations done with other systems can be imported. Also, currently, in Raku LSA via LLM-embeddings can be done. Note, that these LLM applications are done only once

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> -- the subsequent procedures are deterministic.

[20:27] <[Coke]> is it standard for things with REST APIs that return JSON that if there's a language SDK around it, they return JSON as well instead of an in-lang data structure?

[20:27] <[Coke]> (seeing this on an azure library and and seems like they could have gone the one extra step)
