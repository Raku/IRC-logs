[10:09] <librasteve_> wayland: I have had a few further thoughts about keycaps and I would like to propose the following <§ ± ⚛️ ♎️ ♓️ ∅ ∞ £ € ①>  … these are used by App::Crag (there are ascii alternatives as I mentioned, but I just realised that having keycaps would be a lot more fun) … libra is used for Physics::Measure and pisces for Physics::Navigation btw

[10:09] <tellable6> librasteve_, I'll pass your message to wayland
