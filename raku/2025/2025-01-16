[00:12] <jdv> i thought Nil could be passed in an arg list for a optional param and it would cause the default to be used

[00:12] <jdv> i guess its only with "is default" declaration

[00:12] <timo> i only know that assigning it to a container gives it its default back, but signature binding isn't assignment, but binding

[00:13] <jdv> right

[02:47] <guifa> antononcube: what do you mean?

[03:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa I applied to teach a summer class with schedule that overlaps with the TPRC-2025 conference days. I thought I could visit TPRC-2025 during the weekend, but it seems there some mentoring in the weekends is also required.

[03:08] <guifa> aaaah

[03:09] <guifa> sorry I understood that as something internal about TPRC conference was problematic for you

[03:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Damn! I missed the opportunity to answer from that POV!

[03:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa How many of your talks are about LLMs-&-Raku ?

[15:07] <rir> Should a $NativeCall::Types::ok-REPRs key be used instead of a Native::Types class in  "class Cobj is  repr('CPointer') {Code here; }" ?

[15:27] <melezhik> o/

[15:28] <melezhik> I want to .subst using regexp and named captures in second part,

[15:29] <melezhik> m: my $a = "hello"; $a.subst(/ $<foo> = [ \w ]   /,~$<foo>); say $a;

[15:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17fe51b86: OUTPUT: «Use of Nil in string context␤hello␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤»

[15:34] <melezhik> uuups, looks like ~$<foo> is evaled too early ... )
