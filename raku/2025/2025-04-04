[08:36] <grondilu> librasteve: what framework does that?  CRO?

[08:37] <grondilu> I'm interested in building a small web server in raku to serve a stockfish engine.

[08:37] <grondilu> where should I look at?

[08:38] <grondilu> HTTP::Server::Tiny?

[09:18] <Voldenet> grondilu: Air (which is built on top of Red and Cro)

[09:28] *** sena_kun left
[09:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> grondilu: that's done with Cro and Air ... the  idea is that HTML tags like <p>yo</p> can be written as a raku function p 'yo' (Air::Functional) and that you can use the same  abstraction to tuck away the webpage and website boilerplate with site and page functions (Air::Base) ... https://harcstack.org is a good starting place

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw Air is still in early stages and any and all are welcome to feedback and contribute - just raise an issue at the repo (or here)

[16:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu "Humming-Bird" was recently updated and might fit better your mindset. (Judging author's statements here.)

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I personally run my Raku-programmed services on rented servers (DigitalOcean) and provide interactive interfaces to them using Posit's shinyapps.io .

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume at some point the Raku HMTX-&-Air family of packages can be used instead of shinyapps.io.

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> antonncube: since i don’t have a clue what you are talking about, would you mind forking Air::Play (module of Air examples)  and doing a bare minimum example (just a couple of lines) of what you are getting from shiny apps ??

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok.

[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is an example: https://antononcube.shinyapps.io/SEI2HR-flexdashboard/ . Press the button “Source Code” (top-right ) to see the Markdown code with which that interactive interface was generated.

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, ideally, with similar kind of (Markdown) templates Raku would generate interactive interfaces.
