[00:09] <SmokeMachine> I’m playing with a prototype of ECS in Raku… I’m not targeting performance, but I’m really liking the interface to use that. I think it’s becoming very interesting… I’m writing a test example using raylib::bindings and that’s looking good IMHO. Is anyone interested on that? I’ll be writing a blog post about that soon…

[03:19] <wayland76> .tell melezhik Yeah, I didn't ask for the comparison to RakuDist.  Feel free to remove that part, and replace it with a comparison to chef/ansible/cfengine instead :) .  

[03:19] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[03:21] <wayland76> .tell melezhik And, it sounds like the questions should be re-asked, but with Sparky as part of the mix.  My point is, these are the kinds of things that I think people visiting the Sparrow site will want to know.

[03:21] <wayland76> SmokeMachine: What's ECS?  

[03:23] <SmokeMachine> wayland76: Entity Component Systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system

[03:28] <SmokeMachine> wayland76: This is the example I'm working on: https://gist.github.com/FCO/bde2567a11fb2c6c3664c3745a0f8410

[03:30] <SmokeMachine> and this is how it looks: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/fr8xyLkN/CleanShot%202025-07-27%20at%2004.29.20.gif

[05:53] <wayland76> Oh, interesting, thanks!  

[05:56] <patrickb> SmokeMachine: Are you aware of Pop? https://raku.land/zef:jjatria/Pop

[05:56] *** arkiuat left
[05:56] <patrickb> That uses RCS under the hood.

[05:56] <patrickb> ECS

[05:58] <wayland76> RCS?  Instead of git?  :p 

[05:59] <Voldenet> it's very cool that it works so smoothly, but rendering loop in GC-based languages sound like pain

[05:59] <wayland76> I wasn't aware.  Very nice!  :) 

[06:02] <Voldenet> if I were to code a game in raku, i'd build (add/remove/modify) renderable objects in raku, maybe also handle mouse/keyboard events, but main loop would be low-level

[06:04] <Voldenet> with code being executed only when keyboard/mouse/timer events get fired (so if the game is idle and has no timers, it doesn't even run actual game code)

[06:09] <Voldenet> of course, it'd be fully event driven which might be even worse in some cases, but still that's what I'd do :D

[15:11] <ab5tract> Not that I know of

[15:13] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: Cool!!! I didn't know about that! I'll probably steal some ideas from there :)

[15:13] <SmokeMachine> my first initial version of ECS is on github if anyone is interested: https://github.com/FCO/ECS

[15:22] <arkiuat> when I look up "Too few positionals passed; expected 2 arguments but got 1" I see a lot of old bugs that have gotten fixed; I'm getting it now and I can't figure out why

[15:23] <arkiuat> which traces down to this, which is just to bind the attribute: submethod BUILD( Real:D $!xlong ) { } 

[15:23] <arkiuat> every call on the way down to that one has an arg supplied, and I presume the second one would be self

[15:24] <arkiuat> otherwise I have no idea why it would want two positionals

[15:27] <disbot4> <antononcube> @arkiuat Hard to say without looking at the code... What happens if you give a default value to Real:D $!xlong ?

[15:30] *** guifa joined
[15:31] <guifa> ugh finally back online

[15:31] <guifa> Apparently libera isn't a fan of VPNs nor of the main network I had

[15:34] <arkiuat> well, that's weird. When I supply a default value for the parameter of the BUILD submethod, I get an error "ambiguous call: these signatures all match" referring to different class that wasn't at all involved in the call chain of the error that I was reporting

[15:34] *** vasko49 joined
[15:35] <arkiuat> and one of the "signatures that match" is Mu:D $:: *%_) from SETTING::src/core.c/Mu.rakumod line 56

[15:35] <arkiuat> so I guess I'm going to have to golf this down to a minimum repro or something :(

[19:41] <patrickb> antononcube: I think pop itself contains a small example game, a remake of Celeste.
