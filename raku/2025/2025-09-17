[09:24] <ab5tract> vushu: hoping you're still here. I'm curious whether you think the header parsing / code gen part of the raylib bindings could be generalized to, say, generate bindings for Godot's GDExternsion

[12:27] <[Coke]> We have a paid license at work. Some minor complaints on UI, but there is an API which does a lot of what I need to get around that.

[12:27] <[Coke]> They do seem to be updating their potential issue DB pretty regularly.

[12:28] <[Coke]> Didn't have to setup a pipeline or anything - setup a token, they reach into your github (or other) repo and scan a clone

[13:26] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Is there a nice way to do "optional chaining" i.e. mapping a value if it's present and otherwise keeping Nil?

[13:37] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> actually I did end up using with, and maybe it's better that way, but not quite how my brain was approaching the problem initially

[14:25] <smallfoot-> which is the most popular, common or preferred interpreter for Raku?

[14:27] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> If I had control of the classes involved of course I could add candidates for Class:U: that just return Nil but I think something on the caller side would be a nice feature - even Java has it though more verbosely ofc with Optional

[14:31] <tbrowder> in a test i'm doing i get a error when i try to check for an existing path using lives-ok.

[14:32] <smallfoot-> should I be using Rakudo or any other?

[19:15] <tbrowder> so, i am having trbl again. this time with using "=finish" and it doesn't seem to stop module compilation as expected

[19:16] <tbrowder> in either v2025.03 or v2025.08

[19:20] <tbrowder> actually, i only see that on github testing

[19:21] <tbrowder> not on my local host

[19:21] <tbrowder> i'm trying =begin/=end comment to see if that works

[19:23] <tbrowder> ok, that works...

[19:27] <tbrowder> trying =finish again and it works ??? erg, shut my mouth!

[19:40] <Voldenet> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results… unless you're programming ;)

[19:42] <refactus> and thus the slot machine was born
