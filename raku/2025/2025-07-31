[13:35] <arkiuat> Voldenet, huh, I'd have thought that notation would produce a one-element word list

[13:35] <tellable6> 2025-07-31T08:51:00Z #raku <Voldenet> arkiuat: <5> would be IntStr

[13:42] <guifa> huh I had never thought about it working that way.  <...>  is used in a lot of places where the most common interpretaiton of <foo> is ("foo")

[13:43] <guifa> <foo bar> becomes then ("foo", "bar")

[13:43] <guifa> but note that ("foo") is not a list -- it's the comma that makes it so

[13:43] <guifa> ("foo",) would be a single item list

[13:44] <guifa> my \a := ("foo"); say a.WHAT

[13:44] <guifa> m: my \a := ("foo"); say a.WHAT

[13:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e8d7f656: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[14:11] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @arkuiat Can you post a Github Gist, with your color changes?

[14:18] <Voldenet> and I don't even know any other way of making IntStr apart from using a constructor which is… weird

[14:19] <Voldenet> m: my IntStr $x .= new(5, "4"); $x.say; (+$x).say

[18:48] <Voldenet> and it just makes things without true passion for these, just some attention ;)

[19:19] <tellable6> 2025-07-29T08:55:56Z #raku <Voldenet> librasteve: yeah, that sums it up - the other concern was "how to tightly couple model and form so that form can refer to `text` property in a model", but I don't know any obvious way to say `nameof(Todo.text)`
