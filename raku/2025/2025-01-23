[13:55] <SmokeMachine> Have anyone here ever player with eventsource/cqrs in raku?

[13:56] <SmokeMachine> s/player/played/

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I looked up "eventsource" -- haven't used it ever.

[14:09] <jdv> nope.  in general, yes.

[14:11] <SmokeMachine> I’ve been planing writing some kind of “Durable Object” using event source and raku… but it would be so many classes for the commands and the events… than I had an idea I don’t know if genius or just stupid…

[14:13] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/Entity

[14:16] <SmokeMachine> When I run the example on README, this is the output: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/S3qW6ljw/1737641793.JPG

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i’m pretty sure cro offers a set of supply connectors - would be cool to run your supplies over that

[14:17] *** dutchie left
[14:17] <SmokeMachine> But the idea is to define all the commands and events as methods inside the entity class… that way, you can define your whole eventsource in a single class…

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - sorry

[14:19] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: that module (if I continue playing with that) I plan to be generic to be able to use snitching with that…

[14:20] <SmokeMachine> But the “durable object” I plan to write, I’ll be probably using NATS (https://github.com/FCO/nats.raku)

[14:20] *** msiism joined
[14:22] <SmokeMachine> Is the idea of using a single class to define entity, commands and events a good idea?

[14:23] <msiism> lizmat: Re: REPL commands conflicting with actual code. I didn't know this was a problem. And now I'm wondering whether it has to be.

[14:24] <msiism> I mean, in a (Unix) system shell, for example, there's no such divide, as far as I can see.

[14:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> good … i noticed that nats is a cool model some time ago and great to see it is in your plans

[14:28] <timo> "real" commands can always be addressed by their full file path, subs in raku can be addressed with their &name, i think terms with &term:<blah> as well

[14:29] <timo> the current implementation of the repl-only commands is to only run the repl-command if there's an error from trying to run it? maybe only when it's a "no such name" or so

[14:30] <SmokeMachine> jdv: what do you think of that?

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> back to my previous point i also noticed (some time ago… so maybe i’m hallucinating) that cro pipeline nodes can be assigned to separate microservices nodes and that cro provides a simple method to wire up these links … but that’s currently a wild guess and i would need to dig back in to be sure

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> &afk :-(

[14:32] <timo> librasteve, look at the "cro web" tool and the "cro stub" command for that i think

[14:34] <timo> > links-and-options specifies links to other services that should be added to the stub, together with options specific to the service type

[17:26] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I’m not sure… it seems to me that those links should be HTTP…

[17:31] <SmokeMachine> timo: https://nats.io/

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nats says it’s “pseudo-sockets” and cro has websockets afaiui … i’m not saying that these will talk without some adaptation (maybe something like cro zeromq sockets), just that cro links hook up a set of microservices and that seems to me to be what nats does… anyway just a wild eyed ear

[17:42] <timo> looks like nats supports being used over TCP, MQTT, or WebSockets

[17:43] <timo> so NATS is kind of like a pub/sub message broker where you set up any amount of nats servers that are interconnected to behave as one thing and then you have clients that can send and/or receive stuff

[17:44] <SmokeMachine> Yes, it does… nots clients keep connected to the Nats clusters using tcp… but the communication between nodes are done using subjected, rather than ip/port… the link should be the subject…

[17:45] <timo> plus you can turn on this "JetStream" option which will keep data around so you can have "guaranteed to give this message to everyone interested in it, whether or not they are currently listening"

[17:45] <SmokeMachine> Yes…

[17:45] <timo> ok subject based addressing is kind of equivalent to mqtt topics

[17:46] <SmokeMachine> I’ve been writing this https://github.com/FCO/nats.raku, but it has no jet stream support yet…

[17:47] <timo> except i don't think mqtt has something to make request / response simple, it's kind of silly there

[17:47] <SmokeMachine> Kinda equivalente because of the wildcards…

[17:48] <timo> and these queue groups sounds a little like what you have in kafka? where multiple consumers can take messages and every message goes to only one

[17:48] <timo> there's an equivalent for that in zmq as well

[17:48] <timo> for request/response as well

[17:48] <SmokeMachine> Yes, but you don’t need a zookeeper to stroke the index…

[17:48] <timo> and zmq also has publish/subscribe, but it's been a long time since i last looked at that

[17:49] <timo> yeah you don't need a zookeeper, you have to explicitly introduce the nats servers to each other instead i assume?

[17:49] <timo> probably through something like etcd?

[17:50] <SmokeMachine> I think they use gossip protocol… but o read about that so long ago I’m not sure anymore…

[17:52] <SmokeMachine> https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/clustering

[17:54] <timo> oh? the clients have to connect to a server in every cluster if you have superclusters?

[17:54] <timo> i'm just a little out of my depth here though

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not as far out of depth as I am ;-)
