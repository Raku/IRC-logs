[16:04] <[Coke]> new/BUILD/TWEAK - I have an attribute that's an array. I want to have a constructor that takes a string, and use an internal method to populate the attribute from the string. I am confused about which of new/build/tweak are needed here.

[16:12] <tbrowder> i do that same thing and i use TWEAK. in fact, i think i use TWEAK almost all the time. not much THINKING required 😆

[16:14] <[Coke]> You still need a new, yes?

[16:14] <[Coke]> otherwise you get errors about default constructor

[16:15] <tbrowder> arkiuat: pls check out my two doc PRs   and add any comments needed to address yr two doc issues

[16:15] <tbrowder> yes, i do use the .new

[16:16] <[Coke]> You have  git URL I can check out?

[16:16] <disbot1> <librasteve> i also prefer TWEAK

[16:17] <tbrowder> i think i have one in work….

[16:17] <tbrowder> need it soon?

[16:18] <[Coke]> eh, I'll probably figure it out by then.

[16:18] <tbrowder> probably, but looking now

[16:21] <[Coke]> (This exercise is making we want to update the object tutorial. :|

[16:22] <tbrowder> check out github.com/tbrowder/RakuDoc-Utils/

[16:22] <tbrowder> look in lib/…/Subs.rakumod

[16:22] <ab5tract> [Coke]: TWEAK more or less subsumes BUILD for most use cases, but it sounds like for your case BUILD might actually be nicers

[16:23] <tbrowder> class Atom

[16:23] <[Coke]> tbrowder: that has both attrs and style as attributes.

[16:24] <ab5tract> because you can just make sure that your attribute assembler returns a hash, then slip that

[16:24] <tbrowder> yes, it’s a WIP

[16:24] <[Coke]> I want to take the initialization string, process it, then pretend it didn't exist.

[16:24] <[Coke]> ab5tract: any pointers to a BUILD example that does that?

[16:25] <ab5tract> not off the top of my head but let me take a look

[16:26] <ab5tract> hmm, actually maybe that use case is even best  served in new

[16:26] <[Coke]> this is some serious yak shaving, btw. I was trying... to solve a sudoku. :)

[16:26] <ab5tract> :)

[16:26] <tbrowder> yeay, BUILD is maybe better, or in yr own defined new

[16:27] <ab5tract> so yeah, the pattern I had in mind is best served by new, where you slip the processed hash result into the self.bless call

[16:28] <tbrowder> i did ask for you as reviewer for 2 doc PRs

[16:28] <tbrowder> afk&

[16:28] <[Coke]> ok, got there with new.

[16:29] <ab5tract> nice :)

[16:34] <Voldenet> whenever I need custom logic, I simply make my own .new, I feel like it's closer to the constructor from other languages

[16:34] <[Coke]> ok, got past the *errors*. now if I do new { my @a = parse-string($strign); self.bless(:board(@a)), looks like the data isn't being stored.

[16:35] *** dakkar left
[16:35] <Voldenet> m: class X { has @.board; method new(Int $x) { my @x = $x; self.bless(:board(@x)) } }; X.new(42).say # e.g.

[16:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «X.new(board => [42])␤»

[16:37] <[Coke]> ... I'm an idiot. Thank you. Still had some scaffolding in there to get a compilation that I needed to remove now that it's compiling.

[16:38] <Voldenet> thing I never get how to actually use is BUILD

[16:45] <[Coke]> ok. NOW I think that the new isn't setting the attribute.

[16:45] *** jjido joined
[16:45] <ab5tract> Voldenet: That's why TWEAK superseded BUILD for most use cases. You don't have to worry about the signature and all of the attributes will have been set up

[16:46] <[Coke]> I'll golf it at some point. :(

[16:46] <Voldenet> in fact, the same thing I've noticed when using records in C# - a lot of times I prefer to create static method that actually sets all the fields instead of having N constructors

[16:47] <ab5tract> [Coke]: well, technically the attributes are set via the bless call

[16:48] <ab5tract> so at least to some degree the statement "new isn't setting the attribute" is true. But that's borderline pedantic, as I assume you mean the "approach using new"

[16:49] <[Coke]> ending new with self.bless....

[16:49] <[Coke]> (similar to voldenet's example above)

[16:49] <Voldenet> might not work with privates

[16:49] <ab5tract> right, so one other thing to keep in mind is that if you are getting the data from MAIN, $x will be a string

[16:50] <Voldenet> m: class X { has @!board; method new(Int $x) { my @x = $x; self.bless(:board(@x)) } }; X.new(42).say

[16:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «X.new␤»

[16:50] <Voldenet> m: class X { has @!board is built; method new(Int $x) { my @x = $x; self.bless(:board(@x)) } }; X.new(42).say

[16:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «X.new(board => [42])␤»

[16:50] <[Coke]> is built has changed the error message, at least. :)

[16:50] <ab5tract> nice :)

[16:51] <Voldenet> ab5tract: TWEAK feels more like "initialize" method that most languages are missing

[16:52] <Voldenet> and C# ends up doing things like `interface IInitializable { void Initialize(): }`

[16:52] <Voldenet> which is not very beautiful

[16:52] <Voldenet> it's even more pain when you need to do async in constructor

[16:52] <[Coke]> yay, my dumb example now works, and now I have no desire to make the actual problem work. :)

[16:54] <[Coke]> I imagine you'd have to do the callback *first*, and then feed that into an object constructor. (rather than starting to construct and then trying to do a callback from inside new or something)

[16:57] <ab5tract> hmm, I don't know why that would matter off the top of my head

[16:58] *** librasteve_ left
[17:01] <Voldenet> wrong initialization order perhaps

[17:01] <[Coke]> ab5tract: well if you're not awaiting the result, ... what state is the object in after you call new?

[17:01] <ab5tract> m: 13:01 <ab5tract> m: class C { has @!x is built; has @!y is built; method new(Str $s, &c) { self.bless: | c($s) } }; dd C.new: "ok|dok", -> $s { my @sp = $s.split("|"); %( :x(@sp[0]), :y(@sp[1]) ) }

[17:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Confused␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 13:<HERE>01 <ab5tract> m: class C { has @!x is bu␤    expecting any of:␤        colon pair␤»

[17:02] <ab5tract> m: class C { has @!x is built; has @!y is built; method new(Str $s, &c) { self.bless: | c($s) } }; dd C.new: "ok|dok", -> $s { my @sp = $s.split("|"); %( :x(@sp[0]), :y(@sp[1]) ) }

[17:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «C.new(x => ["ok"], y => ["dok"])␤»

[17:02] <[Coke]> Do you have an attribute like $.usable that you trigger off if the callback isn't done?

[17:03] <ab5tract> you can return a failure instead of calling self.bless

[17:03] <ab5tract> but that does honestly sound more complicated than what I would put into a constructor

[17:05] <Voldenet> the example feels like it's really trying to touch internals too much

[17:07] <Voldenet> m: class C { has @!x is built; has @!y is built; }; dd { my @sp = "ok|dok".split("|"); C.new( :x(@sp[0]), :y(@sp[1]) ) }()

[17:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar fdd3bdc56: OUTPUT: «C.new(x => ["ok"], y => ["dok"])␤»

[17:07] <ab5tract> Voldenet: this is contrived

[17:07] <ab5tract> For a sudoku solver, you could imagine processing a string

[17:07] *** yewscion left
[17:07] <Voldenet> I mean, I wouldn't really let outer callback use internal field names, it feels scary to maintain

[17:08] <Voldenet> I'd rather make a separate sub out of it

[17:08] <ab5tract> Voldenet: I agree. I was just demonstrating that there is nothing inherent to stop this from working

[17:09] <Voldenet> ah, that's true

[17:09] <Voldenet> as long as bless gets proper args, it'll work

[17:09] <ab5tract> but yeah, I wouldn't ever do this kind of processing unless it was stable enough to put into a dedicated sub

[17:26] <Voldenet> now that I think of it, in most cases clever logic in the ctor was promoting the class into higher order being that had to be refactored into separate factories/validators at some point

[17:29] <ab5tract> the ctor?

[17:29] <ab5tract> I'm intrigued :)

[17:29] <Voldenet> I mean constructor

[17:30] <ab5tract> Ah, gotcha. c9r :)

[17:31] <ab5tract> I like this idea of being promoted to a higher order being though. Is there a waiting list I can sign onto? :)

[17:32] <Voldenet> sorry, god classes worship queue is now full of sleep-deprived mainainers, can't enqueue more ;)

[17:32] <ab5tract> Also, we have the tiny bits to ensure that any callback is conformant to the requirements of the class attributes

[17:33] <ab5tract> Still doesn't make it a brilliant idea, I think, but it's still kind of cool that we can get there with subsets

[17:37] <ab5tract> hmmm: subset OutShape where  { .keys.sort ~~ <x y> }; subset SigShape of Callable where { .signature ~~ :(Str --> OutShape) }; sub s(Str $s --> OutShape) { %( :x, :y ) }; dd &s ~~ SigShape

[17:37] <ab5tract> lol

[17:38] <ab5tract> m: subset OutShape where  { .keys.sort ~~ <x y> }; subset SigShape of Callable where { .signature ~~ :(Str --> OutShape) }; sub s(Str $s --> OutShape) { %( :x, :y ) }; dd &s ~~ SigShape

[17:42] <Voldenet> not as planned, I suppose

[17:43] <Voldenet> of course, s will return wrong type, but you can only find out when getting a runtime error after the fact

[17:44] <Voldenet> and even if compiler was smart enough to validate attributes (which is possible), it probably won't be smart enough to validate that

[17:47] <ab5tract> yeah that's a good one

[22:41] <wayland76> .tell [Coke] (and ab5tract) With the .new method, instead of calling self.bless, you'd be better off using "callsame" or "callwith".  That'll call the next .new down the chain, eventually getting to Mu.new which will call bless anyway.  

[22:41] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[22:41] *** yewscion joined
[22:41] <ab5tract> wayland76: I don't know if "better off" is the correct wording, considering I have never seen that nor needed it

[22:42] <ab5tract> but its a cool trick to note, regardless

[22:42] <Voldenet> I don't enjoy callsame/callwith and friends

[22:43] <tbrowder> the two issues are related, in my opinion, because of my my view of the **practical** use of the .julian-date, but i'll consider yr points  more closely.

[22:43] <wayland76> ab5tract: Yes, It's not actually necessary, but I think it's a better habit, because otherwise the .new method on any ancestor classes will get skipped.  

[22:44] <wayland76> Voldenet: Why not?  Are they confusing? (I updated the docs because they were)  Do you think the performance is bad?  

[22:44] <Voldenet> to me it feels like I don't know what I'm actually dispatching

[22:44] <Voldenet> I get how that's the whole point of it

[22:45] <wayland76> Oh!   Right.  Yes, that's true.  It's a DWIM thing.  

[22:45] <wayland76> And, now that I think about it, I think I really only use it in .new most of the time.  

[22:45] <Voldenet> I guess it's a habit, because I've been in C# world too long, where the language makes things verbose

[22:46] <wayland76> Yeah, I can see that.  

[22:46] <Voldenet> there is base(…) constructor which is kinda similar

[22:46] <Voldenet> but inheritance is usually not very useful

[22:47] <wayland76> In Raku, or in C#?  

[22:47] <Voldenet> well, in C#, in raku a lot of features work because of it

[22:48] *** yewscion left
[22:48] <Voldenet> a lot of people in C# prefer composition, I'm not sure if there's practical reason for it other than "it's not stylish now"

[22:49] <wayland76> For me, callsame/callwith are just a slightly different way of saying parent::new (or whatever it is).  

[22:50] <Voldenet> actually in raku composition-based style works especially well because of `trait handles`

[22:50] <ab5tract> wayland76: in Java it's super()

[22:50] <wayland76> .tell [Coke] (or nextsame/nextwith, depending on what you're doing)

[22:50] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[22:51] <ab5tract> I don't tend to do much inheritence, roles generally fit better, but it's a great thing to consider wayland76++

[22:51] <wayland76> I guess I see callsame/callwith as being like "Carry on doing what you would've been doing had I not been here".  

[22:51] <tbrowder> arkiuat: i will wo

[22:51] <Voldenet> but wait, can you actually replace self.bless with callwith somehow?

[22:52] <Voldenet> m: class C { has @!x is built; method new($x) { callwith(x=>$x) }}; C.new(42).say

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «C.new(x => [42])␤»

[22:52] <wayland76> Hmm.  I wonder if callsame/callwith are better for working with roles than the parent::new or whatever.  

[22:52] <Voldenet> hm, interesting, I'd think that since new wasn't multi, it wouldn't work

[22:52] <ab5tract> If I see a method new in a role, I cry

[22:52] <tbrowder> *work on it tomorrow

[22:55] *** Guest72 left
[22:55] <wayland76> Voldenet: I think I saw some discussion about this at one point that cued me that it's not specific to multis, it's actually "the next method if I weren't here".  

[22:55] *** Sgeo joined
[22:55] <ab5tract> between new/BUILD/TWEAK and self.bless/callsame/callwith/nextsame/nextwith, I think we can say Raku achieves sufficient complexity in its constructors

[22:56] <Voldenet> ^ true, and the complexity isn't very well communicated imo

[22:56] <wayland76> Actually, found it: https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Re-dispatching That first paragraph in Re-dispatching lists 3 options for the chains of functions we could be working with.  

[22:56] *** Guest72 joined
[22:57] <wayland76> Actually, I wonder sometimes if we don't need BUILDARGS (cf. P5 Moose) and POST-TWEAK, which only happens after the construction is complete.  

[22:57] <Voldenet> there was a time where I was lacking "use X by default, use Y in case where something, use Z in case where something" sort of guideline

[22:58] <wayland76> Anyway, I've got to head to work now.  o/

[22:58] *** wayland76 left
[23:00] <ab5tract> I think TWEAK already implies that construction is complete

[23:01] <Voldenet> I don't think it's sufficient complexity though, C++ has more

[23:01] <Voldenet> it's my gold standard for making constructors scary

[23:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «((a 1) (b 2))␤»

[23:03] <Xliff> O_o? Z is not infix?

[23:04] <ab5tract> syntactically, sure

[23:04] <Xliff> But not technically?

[23:04] <ab5tract> no, because it is not a sub

[23:05] <Voldenet> TWEAK kinda happens durring self.bless, so you could argue that it's happening during the construction

[23:05] <Xliff> m: say <a b c> »x» (1, 2)

[23:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «(a bb c)␤»

[23:05] <ab5tract> x and X are not related

[23:05] <Xliff> However X and Z are?

[23:05] <Voldenet> m: class C { has $.h = builded; sub builded { "hoi" }; submethod TWEAK { dd $!h }; method new() { say "pre"; self.bless; say "post" } }; C.new

[23:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «pre␤$!h = "hoi"␤post␤»

[23:05] <ab5tract> yes.. they are two of the three meta operators

[23:06] <Xliff> Ah, so metaops don't hyper?

[23:07] <ab5tract> Voldenet: that makes sense. I would fight interminably hard against the introduction of anything else into constructor land though

[23:07] <ab5tract> with RakuAST it would be relatively trivial to enforce self.bless being the final line in any new method, but that's arguably not the answr here

[23:08] <Voldenet> it can be endlessly extended, but because self.bless is not the final line, nothing stops you from doing any post-tweaking

[23:08] <Xliff> ab5tract: So the message is a bit LTA. Couldn't it be something like 'Cannot use a metaop in a hyper operation'?

[23:08] <ab5tract> Xliff: no, metaops don't hyper. but what you are doing isn't really hypering, unless I misrmember

[23:09] <Xliff> m: say <a b c> Z (1, 2)

[23:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «((a 1) (b 2))␤»

[23:09] *** lichtkind left
[23:09] <Xliff> I'd be fine if the output there was ((a 1) (b 2) (c 1)) because the Z would wrap around the list. »Z« would if it were allowed.

[23:13] <Xliff> ab5tract: Oh. So that

[23:13] <Voldenet> Z is a metaop, so you gotta give an op

[23:13] <Voldenet> m: say <a b c> >>Z,>> (1, 2)

[23:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 46ed7b403: OUTPUT: «(((a 1)) ((b 2)) ((c 1)))␤»

[23:13] <Voldenet> , is the default

[23:13] <Xliff> ab5tract: Oh. So that's the difference. SMH

[23:13] <Voldenet> the output is somewhat weird

[23:13] <Xliff> Voldenet++

[23:16] <ab5tract> m: dd <a b c> »Z,» (1,2)

[23:17] <Voldenet> probably more useful without Z

[23:19] <ab5tract> Xliff: I agree that it's LTA though. if you file a ticket, I'll try to poke at it

[23:39] <Voldenet> yes, of course it works :/

[23:41] <Voldenet> I'm not sure how to prevent hyper from doing that

[23:46] <Voldenet> maybe… don't use hyper at all
