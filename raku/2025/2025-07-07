[00:00] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[00:32] <apogee_ntv> lizmat: Thanks, do I just transfer it over? Wont changing author break things?

[00:33] <apogee_ntv> guifa: I added read (incl all 5 filters)/tExt metadata to Image::PNG::Portable. I plan to make Image::PNG::Native at some point with the same interface but it's libpng through NativeCall.

[00:33] <apogee_ntv> Though someone dropped a speed up PR so that might solve my issue (large image batches), who knows?

[00:34] <guifa> okay people, bikeshedding time

[00:34] <guifa> my window class will have two special types of methods

[00:34] <guifa> one that represents a native-call-like javascript call into the webview

[00:35] <guifa> and the other represents a method that's callable *from javascript* (need to mark it because it will be installed with some special handling in the webview) 

[00:37] <guifa> method foo is javascript { * } seems fine calling into the webview, but then the reverse isn't obvious.  Thought about to-javascript and from-javascript but feel long, to-js is ironically too short.  other thought was js-call (into js) and js-callable (from js) but they feel too similar

[00:39] <SmokeMachine> is javascript and is callable-from-js?

[00:39] <SmokeMachine> will the methods with no trait work too?

[00:40] <SmokeMachine> guifa: üëÜ

[00:40] <guifa> javascript and js-callable I think I'd do with that model, might work but I don't like the imbalance of js / javascript

[00:40] <guifa> methods with no trait are just normal class methods

[00:41] <SmokeMachine> is using-js and is is-callable?

[00:41] <SmokeMachine> js-callable

[00:41] <SmokeMachine> ja-coded and he-callable

[00:42] <SmokeMachine> js-callable

[00:42] <SmokeMachine> js-coded

[00:43] <SmokeMachine> is using-js and is usable-by-js

[00:47] <apogee_ntv> outbound-call and inbound-call?

[00:48] <apogee_ntv> foo is outbound-call (calling to JS), bar is inbound-call (callable from JS)

[00:48] <apogee_ntv> I would focus on whether you're calling out of or into the Raku app, not the language being called.

[00:50] <apogee_ntv> That seems like the higher order concern.

[00:53] <SmokeMachine> js-native and js-accessible?

[00:54] <SmokeMachine> guifa: üëÜ

[00:54] <SmokeMachine> Good night everyone!

[00:55] <apogee_ntv> gn

[00:56] <guifa> hmm I I like outbound and inbound

[00:57] <guifa> and it's kind of true the language isn't super relevant, but I also want to be specific enough to avoid potential namesquating down the road (unlikely, but still, I try to future proof lol)

[12:12] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: Cromponents have a big flaw (that‚Äôs the next thing I plan to fix) that is not being possible to change the signature of the generated routes‚Ä¶ that way, it‚Äôs not possible, for example, to make an Cromponent only accessible for logged users‚Ä¶ but before fixing that, I‚Äôm going to make it possible to pass attributes as part of the path‚Ä¶

[12:27] *** librasteve joined
[12:27] <disbot3> <librasteve> yeah i am not there with auth yet, but one day soon ‚Ä¶ (ie the auth patter in the cro docs) ‚Ä¶ so its very helpful to have Cromponent get better under the hood ‚Ä¶ I can only consume changes at a certain rate though

[12:29] <disbot3> <librasteve> i cross posted to r/htmx and got this comment >>> I went in with an open mind and was immediately slapped in the face with ‚Äúclass Todo does Component‚Äù and ‚Äúmethod increment is controller‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure I can get behind this syntax.

[12:29] <disbot3> <librasteve> lol

[21:30] <tbrowder> it has a ‚Äîno-terminal option

[21:30] <tbrowder> just wondering‚Ä¶

[21:38] *** librasteve joined
[21:39] <Voldenet> X11 works very poorly on macos, wouldn't recommend

[21:39] *** arkiuat joined
[21:40] <Voldenet> using vm with regular linux is the sanest option for anything related to x11, I've been on a long windows journey

[21:41] <Voldenet> and it's the same stuff, but without problems
