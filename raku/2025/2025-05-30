[21:27] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I was wondering... I'm thinking in adding a `import-module` function... that way one could have a module `class MyDepsModule does Deps::Module { method register { injectable 42 } }`, then on your code, it could be used like: `deps { import-module MyDepsModule; injected my Int $a }` also, instead of using the function, it could also be like: `deps :import[MyDepsModule], { injected my Int $a }`

[21:30] <Voldenet> but if MyDepsModule has register method, couldn't it simply export the sub that'd accept parameter?

[21:31] <Voldenet> `sub use-my-deps($deps = $*deps) { .register 42 }; deps { use-my-deps; }`

[21:32] <SmokeMachine> it wouldn't even need to receive a parameter... it could just use the injected/injectable function... you are correct... I made a class/method to be able to use a role... but I think you are correct...

[21:34] <SmokeMachine> sub use-my-deps { injectable 42 }; deps { use-my-deps; }

[21:37] <Voldenet> I try to use "magic is optional" way

[21:37] <Voldenet> I'd prefer to avoid dynamic variables completely and then add it as an option

[21:37] *** leah2 left
[21:39] <SmokeMachine> you can always use the "low level methods"... register/get...

[21:39] <Voldenet> I see dynamic variables as big hash being passed around in "$context" parameter

[21:45] <Voldenet> they're useful, but you suddenly end up with methods not having clear dependencies

[21:50] *** leah2 joined
[21:57] <SmokeMachine> you can always do something like: `deps -> $deps { do whatever you want with $deps }`

[22:00] <Voldenet> true

[22:01] <Voldenet> either way, the DI composition roots classes kinda make sense in java

[22:03] <Voldenet> there could be some profits from those being classes -  they can theoretically define more parameters or maybe namespaces

[22:24] <SmokeMachine> With the original option of having classes to import, that could be an instance storing data… but that also can be done with functions… so, that’s ok…
