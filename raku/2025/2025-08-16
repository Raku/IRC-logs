[10:38] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> Hiii ! I tried NativeCall with Zig, which works => https://pastecode.dev/s/i0110bd0, I just have 2 questions, why is the TWEAK submethod required for the Str argument (it doesnt pass the .new method if its set as $.name, have to set it as private or then need to make a custom new method), and secondly the explicitly-manage didnt seem to work, the string was being freed and couldnt be printed then, is it a bug or did I use it

[10:38] <disbot6> wrong ?

[10:38] <lizmat> patrickb nine ^^

[10:41] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> when I add is rw to the zhuman_init native signature then the explicitly-manage works, but without, it frees it I think

[10:45] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> (I mean with is rw added to the Str argument in zhuman_init the explicitly-manage works so I dont need to allocate for the name field in the Zig code, which was the workaround since explicitly-manage didnt work without I discover the is rw)

[12:11] <wayland> weekly: https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/general/websites.xml

[12:11] <wayland> lizmat: Does that mean that the weekly-noting-bot is down?  

[12:11] <lizmat> yeah.. looks like

[12:13] <lizmat> I hopefully gave it a kick (well, actually a commit to its repo should force a restart)

[12:13] <wayland> weekly: https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/general/websites.xml

[12:13] <wayland> OK, I'll try that again when I come back from my walk :) 

[12:13] <lizmat> once notable6 returns, you can do that

[12:27] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> oh I love Zig üòÜ

[13:01] <wayland> weekly: https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/general/websites.xml

[13:01] <lizmat> sadly, notable6 hasn't returned yet

[13:01] <wayland> OK.  I'll try again; probably tomorrow.  

[13:03] <lizmat> I've posted it on r/rakulang and c/rakulang

[13:50] <ab5tract> simon_sibl: just out of curiosity , did you see my benchmark blog posts re: using zig with Raku?

[13:51] <ab5tract> Here it is, in case it can prove useful in some way https://5ab5traction5.bearblog.dev/an-initial-investigation-into-using-zig-to-speed-up-raku-code/

[13:52] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> I will take a look, thanks !

[13:58] <ab5tract> It looks like I found I needed to dupe the string too

[14:01] <ab5tract> I just saw your issue in the beginner chat. I don‚Äôt know if the problem is that explicitly-manage is broken. ISTR  that the VM may have moved the string in the meantime

[14:01] <ab5tract> Meaning that the contract to explicitly-manage may still be holding, as the object has only been moved, rather than collected

[14:01] <ab5tract> Please note that the above is only a theory

[14:03] <ab5tract> I suppose that it could also be that the VM throws away the C string generated for the native call as soon as the call has finished.

[14:27] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> the Raku+Zig is very interesting, I havent checked the Supply feature yet but the performance boost is impressive

[14:28] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> yeah it doesnt throw away when I mark the Str as rw, so at least I can save some memory there
