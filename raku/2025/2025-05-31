[01:01] <japhb> Once again I come to you asking for your help with Terminal-Tests screenshots -- all `terminal-quick-test` screenshots are helpful, but especially if any of you have a Mac, Windows, or BSD box -- please install 0.0.5 and send screenshots with your various terminals.

[01:02] <japhb> I'm also going to be updating Terminal-Capabilities to actually have autodetection support; anyone willing to help with non-Linux terminal info would help fill that out.

[01:24] <[Coke]> japhb: what's the package name to install?

[01:24] <[Coke]> No candidates found matching identity: Terminal-Tests

[01:24] <japhb> Terminal::Tests, probably

[02:09] <[Coke]> let me know if I can help with the capabilties work

[02:10] <japhb> [Coke]: Can you give the Mac version and iTerm version for that screenshot?

[02:11] <japhb> Also, I need to find environment variables that will help me uniquely identify various terminals; if you can find any that seem iTerm-related, please send me those as well.

[03:54] <japhb> Terminal::Capabilities now offers autodetection as of version 0.0.4!  It also comes with a `terminal-autodetect` script to quickly check what it has detected about your terminal.

[03:55] <japhb> [Coke]: The terminal autodetection should be updated with the iTerm2 capabilities seen in your screenshot ^^

[16:46] <[Coke]> Default

[16:46] <[Coke]> presumably it could be any named profile you have saved

[19:01] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, I may have misread that (I’m reading rakudo code by my cellphone) but I think that may be possible to make a parameter optional (if it wasn’t already) if I modify the $!flags of that parameter… but because the “… blablabla will never work” is a compiler error (if I remember it correctly), I think that I’ll need to change it at compile time… I may do that inside the trait… does anyone have a better idea?
