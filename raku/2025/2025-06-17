[14:40] <tbrowder> in a sub in a module i'm working on i can't get that ^^^ form to work. my raku says i have two terms in a row. i've never had a prob with using that for before. when i enclose the args inside () it works!!! my raku version is 2025.03.

[14:41] <tbrowder> i'm leaving it as is for now, but any hints welcome. source is on github:

[14:43] <lucs> tbrowder: Is the sub defined before its first use?

[14:44] <tbrowder> hm, good point: it's in a module under lib, so  it should be, but i'll check again with a rerun...

[14:52] <tbrowder> yes, apparently, lots of stuff in lib/.precomp

[15:07] <lucs> Which sub shows the problem?

[15:08] <lucs> Yep, gotcha.

[15:09] <tbrowder> and using Cro fine....so far

[15:12] <[Coke]> tbrowder: that URL looks suspicious

[15:12] <[Coke]> typo?

[15:14] <[Coke]> the obvious typo fix just hangs

[15:18] <tbrowder> sorry, bad eyesight..

[15:19] <disbot2> <nahita3882> v11* is parsed as a Version literal when called without a paranthesis, hence the compile-time error

[15:20] <disbot2> <antononcube> I am / have been repeatedly asked to install a program called ActivTrak on my computer by employers. Anyone dealt with it? I am curious / interested in making a Raku program that "cheats" ActivTrak.

[15:21] <tbrowder> nahita3882: good call, sounds like a raku bug to me

[15:23] <tbrowder> [Coke]: does that website have financial data?

[15:23] <[Coke]> who is https://nurturethevibe.com/blog/teach-llm-to-write-new-programming-language/ ?

[15:24] <[Coke]> flowingdata? nope, unrelated

[15:25] <disbot2> <antononcube> @Coke We just recently discussed LLMs and Raku with '@ntv' in the "#general" Discord channel.

[15:26] <[Coke]> ok. I ask because there's no author information

[15:26] <disbot2> <antononcube> @ntv outlined an impressive amount of LLM-Raku work, making LLM-aware LLMs (almost) from scratch in C.

[15:26] <tbrowder> re my problem: i can chg sub name, but isn't the problem it a valid raku bug?

[15:27] <disbot2> <antononcube> *"Raku-aware LLMs" not "LLM-aware LLMs"...

[15:27] <[Coke]> * isn't a valid char to end a sub name with, no

[15:27] <lucs> tbrowder: I tested, and changing the name appears not to help: still "Two terms in a row"

[15:28] *** librasteve joined
[15:28] <[Coke]> ah, that's not a literal. unclear without looking at source

[15:32] <[Coke]> zef test doesn't complain, raku -c doesn't complain (with a fresh checkout of FinanceAPI)

[17:01] <refactus> was just playing with it, and reminding myself about all the details of version strings. pretty sure the problem is around the is_lexical check in the version token, but seems there are some things I don't remember clearly enough to be immediately helpful

[17:23] <tbrowder> ok, renaming the "v11*" sub to "path-v11*" solved the immediate problem.

[17:24] <tbrowder> it still sounds like a raku problem to me, though. thanks for allm

[18:38] <refactus> unless there's an entirely better way to do the check, it seems like we'd need to check for both with and without the ampersand, because of no-sigil things like my \foo = -> {}
