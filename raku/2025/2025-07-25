[16:48] <tellable6> 2025-07-24T23:46:43Z #raku <wayland> melezhik Thanks for the Sparrow website.  I've updated my Pathways of Entry article to link to it.  

[16:48] <tellable6> hey melezhik, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/05d7faf71637007b63c348c41b5f89e0

[18:38] <avuserow> anyone used Cro to write file uploads directly to disk so you can receive large files (500M+) without using tons of memory?

[18:41] <avuserow> (I know the right way is to use pre-signed URLs and have the user upload to object storage but I don't have object storage in this project yet and hoping to avoid that)

[20:29] <avuserow> a custom Cro::BodyParser looked promising but memory usage still grows (causing it to get killed). I'll make the client responsible for chunking it for now
