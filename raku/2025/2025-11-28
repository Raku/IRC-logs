[03:49] <sibl> if I have a `multi MAIN`, is there a way I could do a kind of `Options *@a` which would be defined outside of all the MAIN so that I dont need to duplicate the sub options if they all take the same ones ?

[03:49] <tellable6> 2025-10-23T10:47:08Z #raku <librasteve> sibl: yeah I need an IRC client that remembers all the messages between logins, faiing that then something I can run 24x7 on my unix server and then ssh from my laptop

[04:29] *** Aedil joined
[04:34] <sibl> I advanced a tiny bit on the IRC client, its somewhat useable but far from good yet xd

[04:34] <sibl> usable* ?

[14:09] <SmokeMachine> sibl: maybe you want a proto?

[14:09] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to sibl

[14:45] *** melezhik left
[15:15] <ugexe> SmokeMachine: that doesn't really help for what I assume they want. For instance you might have every MAIN command take a --verbose flag, and each of those multis needs to reference e.g. :$verbose inside of them. putting :$verbose in a proto means the proto still has to pass it along to a multi that also defines it (and it needs to be defined so it shows up in the help output or whatever)

[15:25] <SmokeMachine> m: proto a(Str, Bool :$*verbose) {*}; multi a("bla", *%_) { say "bla $*verbose" }; multi a("ble", *%_) { say "ble $*verbose" }; a "bla", :verbose; a "ble", :!verbose # I meant something like this... but it seems to not work for main...

[15:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «bla True␤ble False␤»

[15:30] <SmokeMachine> m: proto a(Str, Bool :$verbose) {*}; multi a("bla", |c) { say "bla { c<verbose> }" }; multi a("ble", |c) { say "ble { c<verbose> }" }; a "bla", :verbose; a "ble", :!verbose # this also does not work for MAIN... :(

[15:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «bla True␤ble False␤»

[15:34] <ugexe> having to use/access %_ isn't really comparable

[15:34] <ugexe> %_ [:$verbose, *%] sure, but then you're still writing the name out

[15:36] <ugexe> like how useful would a tooltip in an IDE be if it shows a signature of `multi a(|c) {...}`

[15:36] <timo> can we define a dynamic variable in a signature to be filled by a passed value? then, would the candidates have access to the value?

[15:42] <disbot6> <antononcube> Please vote: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46079585

[15:52] <[Coke]> [dead] ?

[15:54] <timo> m: proto sub foo(|c, :$*verbose = False) { * }; multi sub foo(*%foo) { dd $*verbose }; foo(); foo(:verbose);
