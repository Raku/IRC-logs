[09:22] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: Hi! I don't know if that's interesting to you, but I've been playing with Cromponent support to websocket + htmx... It's not implemented in the best way because each component has its own websocket component... but besides adding an id to the component's html and a calling `$component.^redraw-component` when you want to update the component on browser via websocket, it's transparent... I've been implementing a clock 

[09:22] <SmokeMachine> component that is updated from server side.

[12:45] <wayland76> Question: when Raku 2025.06 comes out, any chance we can get an Alpine image at https://hub.docker.com/_/rakudo-star/ ?  

[12:48] <wayland76> [Coke]: Yeah, I don't think IRC is set up for that.  Might be able to do a temporary private or secret channel though.

[14:36] <[Coke]> I don't think we manage those as part of the normal binary releases. We'd need a volunteer.

[14:37] <[Coke]> patrickb: is this something you could take on?

[14:39] <[Coke]> Looks like not a hard change to make the alpine

[14:40] <patrickb> I'm pretty underwhelmed by rakudo star and would prefer not investing much time there. But the alpine rakudo packages are tracking rakudo releases very closely.

[14:40] <[Coke]> That's fair, IMO

[14:41] <[Coke]> wayland76: if there's a rakudo release tracking alpine, hopefully that covers your need.

[14:45] <patrickb> I wonder, is it worth it to create an image that contains nothing more but alpine + "apk add rakudo zef"?

[14:51] <[Coke]> I think having a rakudo+zef would be amazing 

[14:53] * [Coke] did not realize I had a module included in R*

[19:24] <jdv> when someone says "essential" here what are we talking about?

[19:25] * [Coke] prints up some camelias to give to the raku speakers...

[19:26] <jdv> just curious what makes PSGI, Config-TOML, or HTTP-Status special?

[19:28] <jdv> this has rakudo star vibes:)

[20:09] <jdv> you mean the entire ecosystem or the modules that have been suggested for blin's essential list?

[20:11] <[Coke]> We could also take the "essential" list as the minimum cross-platform testing.

[20:14] *** librasteve left
[20:15] <jdv> interesting idea

[20:16] <jdv> i'm a fan of the either no rakudo star or a rakdudo start of just rakudo+zef kinda idea.  wonder if we could do something similar here.

[20:34] <patrickb> jdv: I've been blowing the same horn for years. The non star rakudo binaries on rakudo.org have zef included for what it's worth.

[20:34] <patrickb> but in the context of blin I can see the usefulness of a subset of the ecosystem for faster test turnaround.

[20:39] <[Coke]> right, that's blin only, though

[20:40] <[Coke]> I.. suppose I could create a Task module that depended on a bunch of stuff and just blin that, and if someone anted to abuse it they could.

[20:41] <jdv> Yeah, I guess there's merit/utiilty there.  still kind of a bandaid but not a bad one.

[20:41] <jdv> oh, the PDF module should probably be on this list in that case.  it typically finds more regressions than anything else, iirc:)

[20:42] <jdv> i'd have to go back and look at all the blin reports but I believe that's the top one.

[20:42] *** librasteve joined
[20:43] <jdv> but that's imperfect because it depends what fresh upheaval is happening for whatever release...

[22:40] <wayland> Regarding R*, what I'm really after is an Official Rakudo docker container that gets automatically released when the monthly release happens.  Is there one of those?  

[22:41] <wayland> But I *do* also want to have zef available.  

[22:41] <lizmat> wayland: looks like that URL is....   incorrect ?

[22:41] <lizmat> may work for you, but now for anybody else ?
