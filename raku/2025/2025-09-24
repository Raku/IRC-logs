[06:41] <patrickb> Raku on RPi 1 is a pain. I've had it running decently on RPi 2 onward.

[06:42] <patrickb> The only limiting factor that one tends to hit: to be able to compile a Rakudo (the compiler itself) one needs >=2 GB of RAM.

[07:39] <Voldenet> I'm guessing that there's no packages with raku for these platforms, armv7h and aarch64

[07:40] <Voldenet> don't seem to be built in arch linux arm at least

[10:29] <patrickb> Voldenet: It's pretty far down on my pretty long to-do list to get pre built packages for the different arm arches on track.

[10:29] <patrickb> one to-do at a time I guess...

[11:33] <Voldenet> Well, the use case is quite rare and people who dabble in SoCs can probably cross compile binaries anyway

[11:35] <Voldenet> also, I retract my statement about raku using luajit – it uses dynasm which is a part of luajit, but not the luajit itself

[11:55] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/whateverable/issues/400

[11:59] <[Coke]> might be an easy one for someone to pick up.

[12:56] <ds7832> .tell melezhik You find details on what I'm trying to do in the Codeberg repo of the shell prototype: ---> "Run BOINC and other energy-intensive tasks when electricity is cheap. Or negative, if you will. This advances science, balances the electricity grid at times of peak wind and solar generation, and even helps combat global heating by improving the cost effectiveness of these renewables. ..." continuation here: https://
