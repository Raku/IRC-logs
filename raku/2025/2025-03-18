[01:48] <jdv> .seen samcv

[01:48] <tellable6> jdv, I saw samcv 2022-01-06T23:28:00Z in #moarvm: <samcv> I think the buffer version of things is more useful in general, and if that has been sufficient and not complained about for so long, it shouldn't hurt to do the same thing for strings

[01:49] <jdv> did samcv disappear into booking?

[10:22] <melezhik> what's up?

[10:23] <melezhik> have been having a good progress with Ditana linux configuration - replacing ansible by Raku and Sparrow ) finger crossed - it's going to be a good show case for Raku

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have at least 6-8 Raku blog posts and videos on my backlog.

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube only that many

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well... I will recount them... But it is mostly, because I try to keep the neat examples videos under 12 min. (Not always succeeding.) Hence, I breakdown some videos into two or three separate videos. Same with blog posts.

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyway I am hoping for your advice ... I found this https://fastht.ml/docs/#getting-help-from-ai which has an AI prompt sheet https://fastht.ml/docs/llms-ctx.txt ... any chance you can help me / tell me (i) make such a prompt sheet for the HARC stack (there are ~10 website examples in the Air::Play repo) and (ii) also say how to use such a prompt sheet??

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh and there are a bunch of Air docs at https://librasteve.github.io/Air/

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> IMPORTANT avert your eyes from the Fast HTML website if you want to preserve your design taste and sanity

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The way "llms-ctx.txt" is used is "one way to do it." I think mentioned that a week or so ago.

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The other principly different way is to use examples.

[14:05] *** habere-et-disper left
[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - so I can use LLM::Functions then and load in all the examples

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See here: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/DSL::Examples

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> omg

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (I do read everything you write, but I don't necessarily remember it)

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> brilliant

[14:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Honestly, same here -- I have to develop a discipline to reread my posts. (And those of others.)

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> As for the examples. You can make a JSON file with examples, so they can be portable. I developed in Python packages similar to "LLM::Functions" and "LLM::Prompts".

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can use "LLM::Prompts" to add a new prompt -- that is similar to "llms-ctx.txt". See this Raku script: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-LLM-Prompts/blob/main/examples/Add-new-user-prompt.raku

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - i'll try

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ideally, you can put the text of your custom prompt in GitHub and create a prompt just from the URL.

[14:18] *** tgt joined
[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right now the most streamlined way of using user prompts is to have JSON specs of LLM prompts in ".local/share/raku/LLM/Prompts". (See XDG data-home. )

[19:24] <sdomi> excuse me being a noob, but I feel like I'm holding something wrong: zef is taking a million years to process anything, I've been stuck at installing Readline for the past 2 minutes. is this expected to be THIS slow?

[19:24] <sdomi> classic disclaimer: I'm on Alpine, so this may be a musl thing. zef is launching rakudo and precompiling *something*, taking roughly 50% of all cores on my laptop

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sdomi: suggest you try Linenoise instead

[19:25] <Voldenet> million years is definitely too slow, for me it usually only takes 10 days at most

[19:25] <sdomi> @librasteve this isn't a Readline specific issue tho

[19:26] <Voldenet> jokes aside, maybe it's some ancient raku

[19:26] <sdomi> first launch of zef without any parameters took 30+ seconds

[19:26] <sdomi> `Welcome to Rakudo™ v2024.09.`

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - how did you install raku? what version do you have? raku -v

[19:26] <Voldenet> it's fairly new

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not too old then

[19:26] <sdomi> installed through apk

[19:27] <sdomi> I can compile it from scratch to see if that would help tho. but I kinda doubt it

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> suggest you uninstall and try rakubrew.org

[19:27] <sdomi> oh, this is neato

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe some dev utils are missing if alpine

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> at least its not windoze

[19:29] <Voldenet> maybe see `strace -c -f zef` for some hints

[19:30] <Voldenet> on my setup futex takes impressively long, 80% of time

[19:30] <sdomi> okay, version from rakubrew seems to be much faster

[20:36] <sdomi> @librasteve worse, it gave me a glibc binary and I didn't notice because gcompat works well enough with it XD
