[02:27] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Does anyone have a good idiom for when you have a topic variable, and you need a CATCH phaser that does something with the topic? Inside CATCH the topic is the exception...

[02:29] <Voldenet> typically in a lot of languages you can't do that, because try/catch have separate scopes

[02:30] <Voldenet> so `try { var x = "thing" } catch(Exception) { …x is not available here.. }`

[02:30] <Voldenet> but in raku I avoid topic variable whenever I have multiple topic variables

[02:31] <Voldenet> m: my $x = "foo"; die; CATCH { default { say $x } };

[02:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[02:32] <Voldenet> maybe you can avoid it somehow and access that topic variable, but it promotes convusion

[02:32] <Voldenet> confusion, even

[02:33] <Voldenet> in fact, in most languages I do the most similar thing: `string x; try { x = "thing"; } catch { …x is available }`

[03:20] <disbot1> <m_zero> Hrm... just noticed that (elem) and (cont) are chaining... but, er, doesn't seem to make much sense.  And, well, it compiles and runs, but doesn't seem to be useful in any real way:  'a' (elem) Set(<a b c>) (elem) Set(<a z>) # is equivalent to: ('a' (elem) Set(<a b c>) & (Set(<a b c>) (elem) Set(<a z>)) 

[03:29] <Voldenet> if you use both it has some sense

[03:30] <Voldenet> m: <f> (elem) <e f g> (cont) <g>

[03:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: ( no output )

[03:30] <Voldenet> m: say so <f> (elem) <e f g> (cont) <g>

[03:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[03:30] <Voldenet> that way you can check if set contains both elements

[03:31] <Voldenet> it's one of these clever tricks I wouldn't use though ;p

[03:33] <Voldenet> it would probably make more sense if (elem) would allow sets as operators

[03:33] <Voldenet> e.g. <a b>.Set (elem) <a b c>.Set (elem) <a b c d> (elem)

[03:33] <Voldenet> and so on

[03:34] <Voldenet> but its usefulness would be extremely limited

[03:34] <disbot1> <m_zero> I think that operation is called subset!

[03:34] <Voldenet> :P

[03:34] <Voldenet> m: say <a b> (<) <a b c> (<) <a b c d>

[03:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[03:34] <Voldenet> yeah it makes sense :D

[03:37] <Voldenet> I've never used this operator but maybe I should use it instead of (elem)

[03:37] <Voldenet> m: say <a> (<) <a b c> # single-values are supported too

[03:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[07:50] <ab5tract> presumably a plugin could auto-replace the texas versions with the unicode versions, or present a user with a virtual keyboard.

[07:50] <ab5tract> Not that I could add it to raku-intellij-plugin, as the parser is currently beyond my comprehension capacity

[16:15] <arkiuat> if I were going to set up keyboard shortcuts for the unicode operators, I would totally want the triggering keystrokes to be typing the texas operator. I wouldn't want to train my finger habits any other way

[16:25] <lucs> If you're running the terminal under X11 and if it won't interfere with other mappings, maybe the the XCompose mechanism can help.

[16:27] <lucs> For example, I press the compose key followed by two "greater than"s to obtain ».

[16:28] <lucs> I use *a lot* of those combinations, especially in my personal documentation files.

[16:28] <lucs> I've remapped dozens of compose key combinations.

[16:28] <arkiuat> that sounds like a good way

[16:29] <arkiuat> I'm not currently running under X11 tho

[16:29] <lucs> Ah. Not sure how to do it in a plain console.

[16:29] <arkiuat> but there are a bazillion different keyboard macro thingies out there

[16:30] <arkiuat> I use vi so I could just remap those sequences if I wanted to do it that way

[16:33] <lucs> Oh, right, I've got them remapped in Vim too, but I'm pretty much always under X11, so I use the XCompose.

[16:33] <arkiuat> there you go!

[18:18] <tbrowder> i can't, nor can i find it with zef.

[18:45] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @tbrowder_04810 I've used Text::CSV (by tux) and CSV::Parser (by tony-o). But not the one you've cited.

[18:52] <tbrowder> thnx

[18:55] <timo2> SmokeMachine: i would be surprised if you could create instances of a class before it's composed

[18:55] <timo2> which happens at the closing brace, as long as it's not a "..."

[18:56] <tbrowder> chatgpt suggested it today, but i’m pretty sure i’ve seen it referenced elsewhere before. there is a Ruby CSV::Writer which confuses the situation

[19:01] <SmokeMachine> timo2: it makes sense... but if I'm creating `class Logic::Ternary does Enumaration {...}` (that I didn't know was an option until earlier today, and it seems and it seems DNA on https://docs.raku.org/type/Enumeration does not work...), how can I create Logic::Ternary::True?

[19:09] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: please ignore my suggestion of yesterday: it won't work, as you've found out

[19:09] <lizmat> I just realized that I ran into that myself a few months ago, and worked around it for SBOM::CycloneDX

[19:09] <lizmat> see https://github.com/lizmat/SBOM-CycloneDX/blob/main/lib/SBOM/enums.rakumod for possible inspiration

[19:10] <lizmat> note that in that case, the definitions of the enums actually live in resource files

[19:10] <SmokeMachine> I'm doing it with class ... does Enumerable, it's kinda working... but I'm not being able to create constants with the enum values on it's namespace... :(

[19:11] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: ☝️

[19:12] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: the code I'm doing looks like this: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/fb9aqpiE/

[19:14] <lizmat> and that doesn't work, I assume ?

[19:16] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IRZvxwTs/image.png

[19:16] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: it does...

[19:17] <SmokeMachine> Now I'm just trying to add Logic::Ternary::True/False/Unknown

[19:17] <lizmat> but the False, True and Unknown don't get exported, right ?

[19:18] *** Geth left
[19:18] *** Geth joined
[19:19] <SmokeMachine> yeah, it doesn't... I was planning adding a sub EXPORT for that. and let the user decide if they want it exported or not and as True/Unknown/False or True3/Unknown3/False3...

[19:19] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @tbrowder Hasn't been updated in 11 years: https://github.com/masak/csv

[19:21] <lizmat> why not export KnownTrue / Unknown / KnownFalse

[19:21] <lizmat> ?

[19:21] <SmokeMachine> it can also be an option

[19:22] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: do you have any suggestion on how can I add the Logic::Ternary::*?

[19:23] <lizmat> well, adding them to Logic::Ternary: stash: would be a start, so Logic::Ternary::<KnownTrue> := ...

[19:24] <lizmat> and possibly Logic::Ternary::EXPORT::  ?

[19:24] <lizmat> my mind's a bit hazy in that area atm  :-)

[19:25] <timo2> personally, i'd probably look at the code in Actions.nqp that handles creation of enums, and then see if using the MOP is a workable approach

[19:25] <timo2> don't we have COMPOSE phasers in classes?

[19:25] <timo2> is that still too early?

[19:27] <SmokeMachine> I was initially trying to follow Bool...

[19:28] <lizmat> COMPOSE doesn't exist: the mainline of the class is run at INIT time

[19:28] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Bool.rakumod

[19:28] <lizmat> actually, when the mainline is ran

[19:28] <lizmat> m: say "running"; class A { say "foo" }; INIT say "bar"; CHECK say "zip"

[19:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «zip␤bar␤running␤foo␤»

[19:51] <tbrowder> jubilatious1_98524: good find! i knew i had seen that a long time ago, just not in mixed-case. I remember wanting to use it but too many competitors at the time, lots still in flux

[20:33] <SmokeMachine> so... my tests are passing... time to add the features, like diferent ways for exporting... Any suggestions? currently I'm thinking on: 1) do not export values, 2) False/Unknown/True, 3) False3/Unknown3/True3, and 4) KnownTrue/Unknown/KnownFalse

[20:43] <arkiuat> it seems with that many different options, I'd go with 1) at first, at least until actual usage shows which of the options is preferred

[20:44] <arkiuat> now that I see it, I really like the KnownTrue/Unknown/KnownFalse formualation

[20:44] <arkiuat> but if I were using this module, I wouldn't be put out by needing to specify which variety I wanted to import
