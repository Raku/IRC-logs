[14:02] <tgt> Hi. I've noticed a couple of minor issues with the docs on docs.raku.org. A few R<> and B<> have been generated weirdly. Search for ÿÿ on https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6%2Ejson-META6%2Ejson and https://docs.raku.org/language/pod. I had a quick look at the source, but I'm not sure where it gets the values from for the R<> tags or why the B<> tags would be rendered incorrectly

[14:08] <lizmat> tgt: could you make an issue please ?

[14:11] <dakkar> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/Website/plugins/page-styling/page-styling.raku#L424-L427 this is probably the code that produces those ÿÿ

[14:23] *** apac joined
[14:30] <tgt> Will do

[14:32] <lizmat> ++tgt

[14:32] <tgt> In doc-website or doc?

[14:32] <lizmat> feels like a website issue, so doc-website I'd say

[14:43] <tgt> Thanks. https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/433

[14:44] <lizmat> thanks!

[14:44] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/02/10/2025-06-its-a-bot/

[14:53] <[Coke]> tgt++ Thank you!

[14:55] <tgt> The reason I came across that issue is I was wondering about the right way to install the dependencies of a single file script using zef (assuming that's the right tool). Should I add a META6.json to the script's directory or can it install them based on the packages used in a script?

[14:55] *** human-blip joined
[14:57] <[Coke]> do you want the single file script to be in an installable package? or is it just a one shot for your own use that you always run out of the directly?

[14:57] <[Coke]> *directory

[14:57] <[Coke]> raku/doc is not meant to be installed, and we still use a META6.json to declare our dependencies so someone working on the repo can 'zef install --deps-only .' to get everything they need.

[14:58] <[Coke]> ecosystem has a lot of examples of scripts that are installable, also, e.g.:

[14:58] <tgt> Just a one-off script for myself

[14:58] <[Coke]> https://github.com/coke/raku-cal https://github.com/coke/raku-uni

[14:59] <tgt> Ah, the `--deps-only .` thing looks like what I want. Thanks

[15:00] <[Coke]> so you could still make it installable (but not have it in a public git repo) and then have a version you worked on separate from the one you run regularly.

[15:02] <[Coke]> Excellent.

[15:48] <tbrowder> howdy, when is the rakulang rainbow butterfly award going to be announced?

[15:48] <tbrowder> at the june conf?

[15:49] <lizmat> tbrowder: good question

[15:49] <lizmat> I'd say: possibly  :-)

[15:49] <lizmat> fwiw, the RSC has not decided yet

[15:55] <tbrowder> as an aside, i'm fumbling with starting a github pages site to host a collection of raku cli pdf tools for a bit of publicity for david warring's wonderful pdf libraries, as well as for raku. i just snagged domain "raku-pdf.tools"

[15:59] <lizmat> congrats!

[15:59] <lizmat> and cool!

[15:59] <tbrowder> i hope any raku bof mtngs at june conf can be attended via zoom or other remote

[16:04] <tbrowder> liz: thnx

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well they have given me the "kiss off" both automatically and after manual review - hope that the RSC will prevail

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I think read / browsed that repository after seeing an article in Hacker News a month or so ago. I didn’t actually try it.

[18:30] <lizmat> librasteve is your remark re IntelliJ ?

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> antononcube said - When I apply for the Ultimate Open Source program of JetBrains "online" I always get the automatic response that I do not qualify. Then I ask for human review and get the corresponding license granted within 1-3 days.

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (forgot that most folks cant see the original comment when I reply) - so "yes"

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (I just thought I would try to follow his lead on an individuak basis - belt and braces)

[18:33] *** jpn joined
[18:34] <lizmat> librasteve please hold your horses: an official request is going to be made in the coming days

[18:34] <lizmat> it took a little while to get the RSC together on this  :-(

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok cool

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nevertheless IntelliJ is -- for me

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I will certainly find a way to stop giving them my $$

[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just proving I read the weekly [afterwards I realised that I could easily swamp the chat]

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> Hi all! I'm trying to overload == and getting this error:  $ ./point.raku 1..1 Cannot resolve caller Numeric(Point:D: ); none of these signatures matches: (Mu:U \v:: *%_) in block at ./point.raku line 20  The code is here: https://gist.github.com/JustThisGuyAZ/f9980a467d36d1975c44a93ff08849bf  I'm not sure how to convert a point to a Numeric value that makes sense.

[22:44] *** librasteve_ joined
[22:45] <librasteve_> this

[22:45] <librasteve_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/T1sulYdU

[22:46] <librasteve_> ^^ just need to move the infix out to the scope where you use it (and can use `{…}` to avoid circularity

[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @justthisguyaz ^^ hope this helps ... iirc there is a way to do cmp built in to raku

[22:51] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> Just tried it, and it works, but I'm still a little confused. Does this mean you have to override == everywhere Point is used?

[22:52] <jdv> who runs the discord bridge?

[22:54] <librasteve_> custom cmp operation https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XYmjLZzu

[22:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @justthisguyaz nope - it just means that the infix declaration is valid in the scope that you declare it ... or you can use export to make it more widely available

[22:58] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> @librasteve, thanks! That does help.

[22:59] <coleman> I don't know who runs the Discord bridge, tbh

[23:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> heres a more exhaustive example https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Measure/blob/34e7b73cd8cd894f3014cc9fc64e5cd28bedda4f/lib/Physics/Measure.rakumod#L630

[23:04] <discord-raku-bot> <justthisguyaz> @librasteve  Thanks! I'll check that out.
