[07:55] <patrickb> JimmyZhuo: Ok. Then I understand why you had so much trouble. As not all back ends use a C toolchain and provide respective $CC, ... make variables 

[07:55] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to JimmyZhuo

[07:56] *** yewscion joined
[07:56] <patrickb> I resorted to using a hard coded msvc compiler call. Assuming that's the only toolchain used / supported on Windows. I have obviously been wrong.

[07:58] <patrickb> It's still a bit of an open question how to solve this. I could add three hard coded compiler commands, one each for cl, GCC and clang and then try to somehow detect which one best to use...

[15:59] <librasteve_> SmokeMachine: I got this error with `zef install Red` on vanilla ubuntu ‚Ä¶ looking at raku.land, seems that this module is only on p5c ‚Ä¶ is it still a Red dependency? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/jYXI0ij0

[16:00] <librasteve_> if still needed then maybe should be adopted as a raku community module?

[16:01] <SmokeMachine> Red shoudn't depend on that... odd...

[16:02] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/META6.json

[16:03] <librasteve_> guess it comes in via NativeLibs https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/9f0lXZIT

[16:03] <SmokeMachine> I don't remember Red ever depended on that... (but we can't ever trust my memory...)

[16:04] <librasteve_> comes in with DBIish https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/DBIish

[16:04] <librasteve_> wich is already a community module

[16:05] <librasteve_> i‚Äôll raise an issue

[16:05] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/B2Samqxa/

[16:06] <SmokeMachine> thanks, but that's odd... I never had that problem, and I just installed Red recently several times...

[16:07] <librasteve_> maybe you are on an older raku - this with 2024.10 ‚Ä¶ I think the fail is caused by the .pm file extension eprecation error

[16:09] <librasteve_> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish/issues/241

[16:13] *** apac joined
[16:20] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/DMWbVOUo/

[16:21] <SmokeMachine> Red has no PM files anymore... is it trying to install an old version of Red?

[16:22] <SmokeMachine> Could you try installing `Red:api<2>`?

[16:24] <SmokeMachine> or `Red:ver<0.1.75>`

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> .

[17:07] *** apac left
[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Red installs DBIish as a dep then that installs NativeHelpers::Blob as a dep ... so maybe you did not need to reinstall NativeHelpers.Blob for a long time since it hasn't changed

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I hit it because I'm doing a new install on a clean machine

[17:19] <SmokeMachine> I keep updating Raku with rakubrew and it makes it required to install everything again, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case‚Ä¶

[17:54] <[Coke]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6FsyQZzJJ0 - added a comment about how this does work in Raku (I didn't watch the whole thing, only the first 60s or so)

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> smokemachine: good point - I have no idea why it doesn't error on your machine

[17:56] <[Coke]> librasteve_: are you having trouble with the latest released version or HEAD?

[17:56] <[Coke]> (of Rakudo)

[17:56] *** Mrtophat left
[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have been testing on 2024.10

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> its an easy workaround just use --/test ... but since DBIish (community module) depends on NativeLibs::Blob (not community module on p6c) then we should move it to community I guess

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (and then we can change to .pm to .rakumod)

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> /NativeLibs::Blob/NativeHelpers::Blob/

[18:03] <[Coke]> that deprecation warning shouldn't cause a failure, though, should it?

[18:06] <SmokeMachine> But even on p6c, it should work with lizmat‚Äôs ecosystem (sorry, I forgot the name)

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [Coke] - maybe not - suggest you cast your eye over the error message in the issue, maybe I am incorect about the cause

[18:23] <ugexe> the failure is the first line of the test output

[18:23] <ugexe> [NativeHelpers::Blob] /bin/sh: 1: gcc: not found

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh yes

[18:24] <[Coke]> ugexe: yes - the discussion before was just about the deprecation. thanks. :)

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well, I am using AWS vanilla ubuntu 24.04LTS for this ... guesss that comes with no gcc

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ubuntu@ip-172-31-4-0:~$ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wrong again

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there is gcc on the box

[18:28] <ugexe> i would suggesting poking at https://github.com/salortiz/NativeHelpers-Blob/blob/b00a4899ce219dae5fe97e9e414d01dd92874f53/t/CompileTestLib.pm#L5-L30
