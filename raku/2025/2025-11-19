[19:13] <patrickb> I'm currently reworking azawawi's File::HomeDir. But I'm changing about everything. It'll basically be a clone of Python's platformdirs.

[19:13] <patrickb> Should I:

[19:13] <patrickb> - Fork and release under a new name.

[19:14] <patrickb> - Ask azawawi if I can take the module over.

[19:14] <patrickb> - Or... ?

[19:22] <lizmat> will the API change ?

[19:24] <patrickb> Yes

[19:25] <lizmat> then I suggest another module name...  maybe Python::Platformdirs ?

[19:25] <lizmat> indicating the influence ?

[19:27] <patrickb> It's incompatible, has different features and methods are called differently. The one reason I see to not fork, is that I don't think we need two modules that do the same thing. Especially when File::HomeDirs is for a large part NYI.

[19:28] <patrickb> I wouldn't put Python in the name. That module is a good blueprint, but it'll confuse the heck out of people because it has nothing to do with Python at all.

[19:31] *** abraxxa-home joined
[19:31] <lizmat> Platform::Directory ?

[19:32] <patrickb> You still favor a fork. Ok.

[19:32] <lizmat> well, I got the impression from you you basically started from scratch ?

[19:32] <patrickb> Or just keep the name: PlatformDirs

[19:33] <lizmat> sure

[19:34] <patrickb> True. Still I wonder wether everyone might be better off when we don't have two modules doing essentially the same thing, one pretty rudimentary and no easy way to know that the other one also exists.

[19:37] <timo> one of the modules could become a thin wrapper around the other maybe

[19:37] <timo> to make a drop-in replacement with some added functionality or bug fixes or so

[19:38] <patrickb> Or put a big "just use that other module" banner at the top of the readme

[19:38] <patrickb> But then I could just as well adopt that module...

[19:39] <patrickb> Aww. I can't make up my mind.

[19:42] <timo> one of the difficult problems in programming; i claim this is one kind of "naming things"

[19:44] <timo> also probably cache invalidation

[20:03] <avuserow> speaking of adopting modules, I want to adopt Crypt::Argon2. how does it work to release it under the raku-community-modules org?

[20:07] <patrickb> (In case anyone wonders - Yes, that dirs module is still preparation for that debugger thingy of mine.)

[20:07] <avuserow> ideally I would like it if others could release/review if I get busy, otherwise I can own this module myself

[20:08] <patrickb> avuserow I guess the first and most important step is trying to contact the original author and communicating your plans.

[20:09] <patrickb> I think it can feel pretty bad if your get stripped from you without even being asked.

[20:09] <patrickb> *your modules

[20:09] <avuserow> yes, I will explicitly do that. (I've been asking for a PR review since ~May and nothing)

[20:13] *** abraxxa-home left
[20:15] <patrickb> 👍🏼

[20:32] <Voldenet> multiple modules doing the same thing is okay, but it can lead to rust-like situation where you have N libs for basic stuff

[20:33] <Voldenet> and then when installing 1 library you end up installing them all because of transitive dependencies

[21:29] <[Coke]> (also, I would say it's better to do a person to person hand off instead of putting something in community modules)

[21:30] <[Coke]> while there can be more than one way... too many is too many.

[21:52] <patrickb> Homebrew users out there can one of you paste the path of the homebrew Rakudo executable please?

[21:58] *** itaipu left

[22:07] <[Coke]> /opt/homebrew/bin/raku ?

[22:07] <[Coke]> (I just installed it and was surprised to find it was the one I just cut)

[22:07] <[Coke]> let me know if you need anything else before I uninstall it.

[22:09] *** arkiuat joined
[22:10] <patrickb> that's perfect. Thanks!

[22:10] <patrickb> no wait

[22:13] <patrickb> can you paste the output of

[22:13] <patrickb> raku -e 'use nqp; say nqp::gethllsym(\"default\", \"SysConfig\").rakudo-home()'

[22:15] *** itaipu joined
[22:17] <[Coke]> /opt/homebrew/Cellar/rakudo/2025.11/share/perl6

[22:45] <patrickb> That's perfect. Thanks! You can uninstall now.

[23:27] * [Coke] wonders why homebrew is using tcl-tk
