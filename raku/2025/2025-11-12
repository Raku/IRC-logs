[01:56] <disbot1> <_ccubed> What do folks use for creating and editing Raku programs? I'm an  old Emacs user and I found the roku mode on GitHub, but none of the ways  the site cited to get it worked for me on Emacs v27.1. I've been tried to use Vscode, the raku mode there is very nice, but I can't find out how to tell CoPilot to get out of the way. I would perhaps eventually use CoPilot but at the start it's very distracting.

[01:57] <disbot1> <_ccubed> tried -> trying

[02:00] <disbot1> <_ccubed> I was lured into using WSL on my relatively new machine and now I regret it, but it seems like way to big a project right now to start over.

[02:03] <disbot1> <antononcube> I like Emacs and I tried to use it for development with R and Raku. Those modes are too basic.

[02:05] <disbot1> <antononcube> I am more or less forced to use VS Code (VSCodium) -- I think the VS Code Raku plugins are very decent. Copilot is not a problem for me. (Meaning, I do not see it.)

[02:05] <disbot1> <antononcube> In VS Code I use Raku 97% of the time in Raku notebooks.

[08:16] <disbot1> <librasteve> @_ccubed I switch between just rawdogging vi (folding yes, code hilite no, Grammar::Tracer, repl debug) and the full IntelliJ plus Raku Interactive Plugin (RIP) available in the marketplace. I am a student of Anton and I am ramping my use of the Raku Jupyter::Chatbook that works very well in IntelliJ also. I find ChatGPT pretty good for raku (and very nice in a chatbook where would can weave multiple AI threads and backtrack),

[08:16] <disbot1> but I do not use AI autocomplete such as Copilot. The only drawback is to stay a little behind the bleeding edge until the plugin is updated when there is a new release (recently found the IntelliJ Spec & Math Symbols which is very nice).

[08:16] <disbot1> <librasteve> Also the RIP has a nice Grammar Inspector.

[08:20] *** arkiuat left
[08:20] <ab5tract> Is RIP in the marketplace? :O

[08:22] <ab5tract> I've been meaning to deal with submitting it, but then they went and announced that the next version of IntelliJ will revive its goal of allowing third party builds of custom IntelliJ standalones

[08:23] <ab5tract> complete with hosted CI/CD pipelines for generating them. Details have been scarce so far, but it is pretty exciting

[08:24] <disbot1> <librasteve> oh - sorry - not on the marketplace yet - need to download and install locally from https://github.com/ab5tract/raku-intellij-plugin  - my bad

[16:14] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine the problem is given doesn't do any form of pattern matching

[16:22] <ab5tract> aruniecrisps: does resembling also work with where clauses?

[16:22] <ab5tract> so that I could have a Stephen King specific match, for example

[16:25] *** human-blip left
[16:25] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @ab5tract right now it's just leveraging the signature matching capabilities of pointy blocks

[16:25] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> or that's the idea of it

[16:27] *** human-blip joined
[16:28] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> however there is a catch with regards to signature matching, which is that iirc where clauses don't work in smartmatches, so I'm not sure whether it'll actually work because underneath the hood I'm basically planning on generating something like when $_ ~~ $<pointy-block>.signature { $<pointy-block>($_) }

[16:29] <ab5tract> what I meant is, does this work: given $b { resembling -> Book $ (:$author where 'King, Stephen') { say "IT" }; resembling -> Book $ (:$author) { ... }; };

[16:31] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> I wanted to ask @lizmat about worked, specifically whether the corresponding action for the otherwise clause is generated as a RakuAST or whether it’s just executing at runtime: https://raku.land/zef:elcaro/Slang::Otherwise

[16:32] *** melezhik_ left
[16:32] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> about out Slang::Otherwise worked *

[16:33] <lizmat> aruniecrisps  not sure I understand the question?

[16:35] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @lizmat here’s the file for reference, I’ll ask the question after this message cause I don’t know how it’ll display on irc: https://github.com/0racle/raku-Slang-Otherwise/blob/master/lib/Slang/Otherwise.rakumod

[16:35] <lizmat> so what is the question?

[16:35] <disbot1> <librasteve> @aruniecrisps resembling looks very interesting (although I do not understand the distinction between resembling -> Book $ (:$author) {} fwiw I tried writing something like when Book -> (:$author) {} and that showed me (I think) why resembling is needed

[16:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> is it you idea to mix resembling and when and default clauses willy nilly?

[16:37] <SmokeMachine> I remember playing with something related to pattern matching… I’m searching for it…

[16:38] <ab5tract> There is a cool pattern matching library out there, I can’t recall its name right now

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> is the cool library this one?https://raku.land/zef:CIAvash/PatternMatching

[16:39] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @lizmat So in Otherwise::Actions in the method statement-control:sym<for>, there’s an if statement which doesn’t seem to generate a RakuAST, but if you look at Otherwise::Actions::Legacy you see a QAST being generated. My question is, is the method in Otherwise::Actions generating a AST under the hood similar to ::Legacy or is it just running the if statement at run time?

[16:41] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve that is basically the idea, when doesn’t work with pointy block restructuring because it uses smart matching

[16:41] <SmokeMachine> it does look cool

[16:41] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Pointy block destructuring*

[16:42] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> The other idea I had is basically to create a slang that changes the behavior of smart matching against a signature to automatically generate the destructured variables in the block

[16:43] <lizmat> all of the code of Slang::Otherwise is run at compile time

[16:45] <disbot1> <librasteve> why not just call it when?, so you can have eg ```

[16:45] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> I could do that

[16:46] <disbot1> <librasteve>  my Book $b = Book.new(author => 'Vickram');  given $b {     when Magazine {...}     when -> Book $ (:$author) {...}     default {...} } 

[16:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> the distinction being the -> pointy syntax in that position

[16:48] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @lizmat thanks! I have one follow question: do you have an idea where the replace-otherwise method is coming from?

[16:49] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve I'm on my phone soiol get back to you after work

[16:50] <lizmat> That's a RakuAST::Block method

[16:51] <lizmat> no, a RakuAST::Statement::For method

[16:54] *** abraxxa left
[17:01] <timo> https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/96 i would love a few users to throw some invalid json at this branch of JSON::Fast and see if the error messages that now show a bit of context work correctly, that would be great

[17:05] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @_ccubed I'm currently using neovim right now, I don't use vscode these days because I'm not a big fan of the integrated AI stuff

[17:05] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> That being said I find the support neovim support for Raku a bit outdated and so I have thought about making a tree sitter grammar for raku, I have a repo up as well

[17:06] <ab5tract> distbot seems to have dropped everything from librasteve++'s "eg ``"

[17:07] <ab5tract> aruniecrisps: that would be incredible

[17:08] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @lizmat thanks! Where can i go have a look at the RakuAST methods? I'll do a deep dive into it

[17:08] <ab5tract> rakudo.git:src/Raku/ast

[17:08] <lizmat> also https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/Raku/ast/README.md

[17:09] *** librasteve_ joined
[17:09] <ab5tract> I haven't revisited that readme in a while.. maybe it will be worth my while to read it with fresh eyes

[17:11] <disbot1> <librasteve> ab5tract - nope that's me changing my mind about what to type and forgetting to adjust the earlier words 🤯

[17:12] <ab5tract> ah, I see, the eg arrived in your next message

[17:12] <ab5tract> aruniecrisps: this library handles where clauses https://raku.land/zef:CIAvash/PatternMatching

[17:12] <disbot1> <librasteve> I think a Raku tree sitter/LSP would be cool ... my hope is that this would be usable everwhere (such as IntelliJ) but I am not holding my breath!

[17:13] <ab5tract> JetBrains is throwing in their hat and providing an LSP plugin 

[17:14] <ab5tract> the other option could have been to embed the entire intellij parser into an LSP

[17:16] <disbot1> <librasteve> maybe the Rainbow Grammar would help?

[17:16] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @ab5tract here's the repo, if you wanna have a look and contribute that would be great! https://github.com/arunvickram/tree-sitter-raku

[17:17] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve @ab5tract I'm not smart enough to make a language server, let alone for Raku haha

[17:17] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> That may be above my pay grade

[17:17] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Although I started trying to make one in rust based off tower-lsp https://github.com/arunvickram/RakuMariner

[17:20] <ab5tract> oh right, treesitter is "just"

[17:21] <ab5tract> for syntax highlight, right?

[17:24] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Yep, you get syntax highlighting, but it's a bit more intelligent than just static syntax highlighting

[17:31] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve is there a way to use Hilite just as a JS library that's not part of Air? I'm making a documentation site using Astro and I wanted to see if I could just use the syntax highlighting

[18:24] <ab5tract> thunking is when an expresion is turned into a block with an implicit invocant

[18:25] <ab5tract> subset Acceptable of Bool where True  # True will be thunked to { $_ ~~ True }

[18:26] <lizmat> Having special syntax handling causing it to not immediately be executed (like a Callable) but without having an independent scope.

[18:32] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: this is definitely part of the "problem" -- https://github.com/users/ab5tract/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=131246238&issue=rakudo%7Crakudo%7C5910

[18:32] <ab5tract> sorry, R#5910

[18:32] <linkable6> R#5910 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5910 [6.e] `$CALLER::foo` allows access to caller's `my $foo` in 6.e

[18:33] <ab5tract> I guess it's over-constrained. Probably it needs to include the topic variable, at least

[18:34] <ab5tract> though, without knowing your use case, there is always the chance that this is actually a DiWiDT

[18:34] <lizmat> you mean, allowing CALLER::<$_> ?

[18:34] <ab5tract> lizmat: yeah, that's what SmokeMachine was asking about

[18:34] <ab5tract> wouldn't $_ be considered an "our" scoped var?

[18:35] <lizmat> no

[18:35] <ab5tract> ok

[18:36] <lizmat> from an optimization point of view, each scope has its own $_

[18:36] <lizmat> lexical

[18:36] <lizmat> m: dd { say "foo" }

[18:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «-> ;; $_? is raw = OUTER::<$_> { #`(Block|4170659133424) ... }␤»

[18:36] <lizmat> note the "$_? is raw = OUTER::<$_>" in that signature

[18:38] <ab5tract> so no, SmokeMachine, you may not access CALLER::<$_>

[18:38] <ab5tract> solution: use a named variable with an our scope 

[18:39] <ab5tract> hope that's possible to do, but also curious to know why it won't work if it isn't possible

[18:40] <ab5tract> thanks lizmat, I had momentarily forgotten that they are created as part of signatures

[18:43] <SmokeMachine> maybe it should be an macro...

[18:43] <lizmat> for the 2025.10 release, I needed to fix some CPAN5 modules

[18:43] <lizmat> this was the diff I applied:

[18:43] <lizmat> +        !! callframe(2).my<::?PACKAGE>.^name ~ '::' ~ $name

[18:44] <lizmat> perhaps that hack could work ?

[19:30] <lizmat> so specifying a variable in a Routine signature, will also *add* it to the lexpad

[19:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[19:30] <lizmat> but $_ will also be there, always

[19:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[21:41] <[Coke]> any english folks here who can tell me how disgusting it is that I've added sugar free peach drink flavor to my earl gray?

[21:50] <jdv> i can tell you that as an american

[21:52] <[Coke]> it tastes good, like a fruity caffeinated tea

[21:52] <[Coke]> just wait until I get the orange flavor shipped!

[23:32] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @SmokeMachine "thunk" is what (I've seen people refer to) the * character's name/role in Raku. "Thunking" is the process.

[23:32] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> m: put "CAT".map({$_.lc})

[23:33] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> m: put "CAT".map( *.lc );

[23:36] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> (apologies for the poor grammar... ).

[23:46] <Voldenet> too bad * can't be put inside sub args that way

[23:47] <Voldenet> m: put "CAT".map(lc(*));

[23:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «No such method 'lc' for invocant of type 'Whatever'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «cat␤»

[23:50] <Voldenet> Ofc, you can simply pass &lc or do the following (although blocks aren't exactly free):

[23:50] <Voldenet> m: put "CAT".map(x.assuming());

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    x used at line 1␤␤»

[23:50] <Voldenet> m: put "CAT".map(&lc.assuming());

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «cat␤»

[23:56] <lizmat> why not .map(*.lc) ?
