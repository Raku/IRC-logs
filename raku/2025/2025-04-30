[02:06] <Voldenet> timo: I'll attempt snapshotting and see if things even start properly and if I manage to use it, I'll see if performance winnings are worth the effort

[02:13] <Voldenet> I'm not overly optimistic, but from what I've seen in the past, I think it might save around 30% of start time‚Ä¶ but it might also not work properly thanks to libuv's event loop

[10:32] <timo> yeah we will most likely need to put some changes into moar itself, a bit like when brrt built support for fork into it

[10:34] <timo> and a spot inside nqp's HLL::Compiler or HLL::Backend where the freezing should happen

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb I kind of working on a "rant finder" for the IRC logs. I wanted to make work over LLaMA models using RAG (retrieval augmented generation). Turned out that the newest LLaMA models changed their API (slightly, but previous workflows break.)

[14:17] <[Coke]> misusing rakubrew how?

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> Coke: oh, how to switch between version, how the choice between shim and env mode influences that, and how my environment in turn influences my choice between the two modes!

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> like, all of those conspire to make it non-obvious to figure out what I even want to do in the first place

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> I did end up going with ./Configure.pl and a prefix and running zef manually for now

[14:46] *** wayland left
[14:46] <[Coke]> rakubrew is great if you're doing a lot of switching *back* to versions you've already built once - if you're always updating forward, manual builds are fine. (but rakubrew can help automate that also)

[14:46] *** wayland joined
[14:47] <[Coke]> I use rakubrew to mainly stay on a "release", but then for testing might do a build of HEAD and then switch back when done

[14:47] <[Coke]> (and being able to *download* a release instead of building is also sweet)

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> Right! But it also is "learning a tool" when I'm trying to solve a problem right now; I'm not gonna abandon it complete, just side-step it for now. :-)

[14:48] <[Coke]> cool

[17:41] <vasko> @librasteve I've just discovered the Air/hArc stack and it's so cool! It's like so much more advanced than anything else I've seen language integration wise.

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Vasko Da Gama?

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> –í–∞—Å–∫–æ –î–∞ –ì–∞–º–∞, —Å–∏—Ä–µ—á.

[18:26] <vasko> I'm afraid I'm not the famous explorer, and yes –í–∞—Å–∫–æ is correct :D

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> vasko: thanks for the feedback ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm almost done with Air::Form, then I need to make a couple of live sites. feel free to request / suggest stuff ‚Ä¶ but bear in mind a PR is the surest way to get what you want!

[18:58] <vasko> Ah so that's I'm getting `Could not find Air::Form` on `zef install .` on the `Air-Play` repo :)

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> <vasko> Here is the reference I had in mind: https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/–í–∞—Å–∫–æ_–¥–∞_–ì–∞–º–∞_–æ—Ç_—Å–µ–ª–æ_–†—É–ø—á–∞ . Bulgarians of a certain generation would know it. üôÇ
