[00:11] <jdv> lizmat: its installing Whateverable

[00:12] <jdv> my guess is because IRC::Client spec's the ssl ver but Whateverable doesnt and for whatever reason 2 different vers of ssl can't be loaded at the same time?

[01:36] <guifa> Ha, no mug references

[01:40] <disbot3> <apogee> Would it try to check C or Rust?

[10:41] <wayland76> Regarding the AI-generated stuff, I think the job of developers is going to become reviewing AI output.  However, the AI output needs to be reviewed by developers who understand the system.  Also, we've had a good experience having CodeRabbit write code reviews -- it's suggestions can mostly be divided into "Good idea" and "Good idea but overkill"

One thing I'd like to suggest (which is compatible with what you've already done) is that, as we redesign the Raku sites, that we give them a similar look/feel, but theme each one in a different colour of Camelia (eg. the magenta, which you've chosen, the blue, the yellow, etc.  :)
