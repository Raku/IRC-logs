[01:06] <Xliff> Hello!

[01:06] <Xliff> Has anyone tried parsing C++ in Raku, yet?

[01:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Sure.

[01:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I decided it is not worth spending my time on that. There is an interesting more general effort that is for C, C++, and Java.

[01:10] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> Is there a finalized location for TPRC in Greenville this year?

[01:10] <Xliff> antoncube: Do you have a link to that effort?

[02:03] <[Coke]> finalized? tickets are on sale, I have my hotel reservation...

[02:04] <[Coke]> https://tprc.us/tprc-2025-gsp/location/

[02:04] <[Coke]> please also update https://github.com/perlconference/tprc-2025-gsp/wiki/Raku-BOF

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> ah okay, I was just being blind

[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Xliff I spent half an hour searching for that project. It is about translation of different languages into AST given as an XML.

[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> are there any thoughts to have another f2f [perl & ]raku conference in europe?

[13:22] <lizmat> librasteve the only plan I know of is another Raku Core Summit in June for the Raku core team

[13:25] *** nine left
[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - ok .... does Cro count as Core ?

[13:37] <melezhik> how can I insert element into array after specific element, given I know the index of element to insert after?

[13:43] *** JimmyZhuo left
[13:44] <librasteve_> splice()

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: my @array = <a b c d>; say splice @array, 2, 0, 'X';

[13:47] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar cb5249181: OUTPUT: «[]␤»

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  [] 

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: my @a = <a b c d>; my @b = splice @array, 2, 0, 'X'; say @b

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Variable '@array' is not declared.  Did you mean any of these: 'Array', 'array'? at /home/glot/main.raku:1 ------> my @a = <a b c d>; my @b = splice ⏏@array, 2, 0, 'X'; say @b

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  [a b X d] 

[13:55] <librasteve_> m: my @a = <a b c d>; @a.splice(2, 1, 'X'); say @a

[13:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar cb5249181: OUTPUT: «[a b X d]␤»

[13:55] <librasteve_> if you want the method form

[14:00] <librasteve_> here ‘2’ is the start of the insertion and ‘1’ is the elems to be inserted - NB this only works to insert as in replace an existing element it can’t be used to shift everything else right one afaik

[14:17] <librasteve_> oh - splice can insert, the 2nd Int really means “overwrite this many items”
