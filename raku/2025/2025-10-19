[01:17] <Voldenet> this would suggest it doesn't

[01:18] <Voldenet> because there's single certificate file

[01:19] <[Coke]> OK. might be a red herring, I do see a content-length error in the response: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5986

[01:20] <[Coke]> (the ask on SNI was just getting 400 error, couldn't see the trace when I asked that, so was just looking for things in the API docs that were required that I might be missing)

[01:23] <[Coke]> oh, duh, I am not passing that arg in as :headers

[01:23] <[Coke]> ok, cro doesn't like it when I specify a content length? I'm now getting an error:

[01:24] <[Coke]> [TRACE(anon 4)] Cro::ConnectionConditional QUIT Cannot convert string to number: trailing characters after number in '22898<HERE>,3203' (indicated by <HERE>)

[01:24] <[Coke]> I set Content-Length to just "22898"

[01:26] <[Coke]> ... wtf. I reran it and it worked?

[01:26] <Voldenet> I was going to bet that $body.elems is different than $path.s, but I am unable to reproduce it

[01:27] <Voldenet> though I'd use $body.elems just to prevent this kind of bug

[01:27] <Voldenet> just in case it changes between being read and sent

[01:28] <[Coke]> nope, just dumb mistakes at this point. :)

[01:28] <[Coke]> I'm getting there.

[01:29] <[Coke]> \o/

[01:44] <[Coke]> cro++ for the CRO_TRACE which made it possible to see what was going on without having to change any code.

[01:45] <[Coke]> and then I just needed to keep my mouth shut while trying to fix things. :)

[12:46] * [Coke] does the release dance with rakubrew and reinstalls all his commonly used modules.

[13:14] <[Coke]> go to raku.land. type in something in the search box, hit command-A delete... the command-A appears to be disabled?

[14:57] <[Coke]> our release Akefile has steps that do "run <ake nqp>" - from inside an Akefile. surely there is a better way to call an ake task from inside.

[20:56] <SmokeMachine> I've been playing with ternary logic, it is fun... Does this module make sense to anyone? https://github.com/FCO/Logic-Ternary

[21:05] <SmokeMachine> I Amy very impressed on how easy Raku made that possible… the only problems are the same I had with Red (but on Red I was able to find a workaround). The short circuit operators not being overridable. I still plan to change that with RakuAST, but I’m not sure if it will be possible/enough.

[22:09] <SmokeMachine> I'm rethinking it... what would be better to be the name of a operator to receive 2 args, coerce them to Logic::Ternary and return the `and` of them? `AND` or `and3`?

[22:24] <arkiuat> I prefer and3 of those two. 

[22:26] <lizmat> wouldn't it make more sense to put the code in a role, and mix that into the enum ?

[22:27] <lizmat> also, I think method gist could just be self.Str ?

[22:27] <lizmat> afk&
