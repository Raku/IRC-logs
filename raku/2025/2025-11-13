[01:35] <Voldenet> because subroutines and methods sometimes require * as argument, perhaps lc was not the best example

[01:40] <Voldenet> once in a while I wish it was usable that way, but it's not often

[11:09] <wayland76> .tell librasteve : I've now incorporated the symbols you mentioned into the keyboard layout.  I've sent away for some sample keycaps, which should take about 2 weeks to get here.  If I'm happy with them, then I'll aim to release a .json file that can be fed into Thockfactory to get your own set of Raku keycaps.  I've bought a second keyboard (Cherry MX compatible) so that I can have another keyboard just for Raku symbols.  It should also cover the Greek 

[11:09] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to librasteve

[18:55] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/0f80db4f477e390b65b1060604f709078b0a098d/t/86-prefetch.rakutest#L37-L42

[19:14] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine I'm confused, does having :prefetch in relationship mean that toggling prefetch in the method is redundant?

[19:17] <SmokeMachine> If you have :prefetch in the relationship, it will prefetch by default, unless you ask the opposite with the method prefetch. For example, on that test, buyer, by default prefetches, but if you don’t want to prefetch, you can .prefetch(:!buyer)

[19:19] <SmokeMachine> If you have a relationship that does not prefetch (called rel, for example) and another relationship you want to be sure that will not prefetch (rel2), you can do Model.^all.prefatch: :rel, :!rel2

[19:20] <SmokeMachine> That test is still not very useful… it is not testing if it did prefetch or not… it only tests the return, but I’ll improve that in the future

[22:41] <patrickb> I want to call a function that gets passed a *wchar_t into which it writes a pointer. I guess I somehow have to use a `Buf[uint8]`. But how?

[22:57] <patrickb> `Pointer[uint16] $outstr is rw` could do the trick...
