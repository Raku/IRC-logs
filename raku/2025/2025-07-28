[08:12] <notable6> librasteve_, Noted! (weekly)

[08:12] <tellable6> 2025-07-26T10:26:58Z #raku <melezhik> librasteve_: you may use any example you think is reasonable to use for a new Raku web site from https://sparrowhub.io/examples

[08:12] <tellable6> 2025-07-26T10:27:34Z #raku <melezhik> librasteve_: if you need anything fancier - please let me know - I will see what I can do

[08:34] <Voldenet> librasteve_: cool post, but one thing about the approach bothers me - "hx-post" address written manually instead of referencing a method somehow

[08:34] <Voldenet> so even if you mix HxTodo into model, the address isn't exactly loosely coupled

[08:34] <Voldenet> and the form itself is tightly coupled to the model as well

[08:36] *** arkiuat joined
[08:40] <Voldenet> not that I think this code can be any more generic

[08:41] *** arkiuat left

[09:09] *** arkiuat left
[09:35] <guifa> so I was looking at how WKWebView wowrks, it looks like I won't ever be able to enable direct access to DOM objects because SeCuRiTy 

[09:36] <guifa> best thing I can think of is modify the prototypes and give every DOM a UUID, then pass that over to Raku as psuedo element that contains the ID and can translate method/attribute calls on it

[09:39] *** arkiuat joined
[09:43] *** arkiuat left
[09:45] *** guifa left
[09:47] <SmokeMachine> Voldenet: I was thinking the same on my Cromponents, and on my prerelease versions, calling a method with accessible (controller on Air) trait from the RENDER method would return the attributes to access that method (using htmx or not)‚Ä¶ I removed it because I couldn‚Äôt find a good way to get the real path of the component‚Ä¶ it could be under a different path‚Ä¶ but I plan to retry that someday‚Ä¶

[09:54] <SmokeMachine> So, on my old version Cromponent,  you had a method `sub bla(Int $i) is accessible{ :http-method<PUT> }` and on your RENDER you have: `<button <.bla: 42>>‚Ä¶` that call should, return at least: `hex-put=‚Äú/<component-url-path>/<obj-id>/bla/42‚Äù` and probably all other attributes set on `is accessible`‚Ä¶

[09:59] <Voldenet> Not sure if it's useful, but it's related - in .net there's something like this https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.urlhelper.action?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2

[10:00] <SmokeMachine> But I think that for doing that I need a better way for getting the path for an endpoint from Cro itself‚Ä¶ and I couldn‚Äôt find a way for getting that‚Ä¶

[10:00] <Voldenet> I wonder if cro even has component -> route map somewhere

[10:01] <SmokeMachine> Yeah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it does‚Ä¶ and that why I removed that option from Cromponents‚Ä¶ and I plan to try to find a way to add that to Cro‚Ä¶

[10:02] <Voldenet> though definitely it's something that Cro should be able to do

[10:03] <SmokeMachine> Even it I need to ass the block code itself as parameter to make it able do search on its tree to return the path‚Ä¶ but  it would be better to use some kind of a name‚Ä¶

[10:05] <Voldenet> well, .net theoretically could accept Expression with controller call, but practically it's not that magical for some reason

[10:06] *** arkiuat joined
[10:07] <Voldenet> probably even a simple helper would do the job, without something like `url-to-controller(&Todo.update, :id(42))`

[10:09] <Voldenet> or even `url-to-controller({ Todo.update(id => 42) })`

[14:24] <guifa> if you pass a method callback to NativeCall 

[14:24] *** apac left
[14:25] <guifa> is that going to be unique to a specific object or generic for all instances?

[18:00] <disbot4> <librasteve> @antononcube ‚Ä¶ just riffing on earlier comments here ;-)

[18:01] <disbot4> <antononcube> üí° Agh... yeah, of course!

[18:40] <tbrowder> hi, how can i use zef to fetch a distro source to a specific directory?

[18:43] <disbot4> <melezhik.> tbrowder: you may use that  - as sparrow plugin or you may just steal , idea from - https://sparrowhub.io/plugin/zef-fetch/0.001000

[18:43] *** LainIwakura joined
[18:49] <[Coke]> Looks like 'fetch' isn't giving you a local copy but is putting in the normal download dir

[18:49] <[Coke]> If you just want to poke around, 'zef look App::Cal' will open a shell in a downloaded copy of the repo

[18:59] <tbrowder> [Coke]: that‚Äôs what i need, thnx!

[19:00] <tbrowder> btw, finally got through Utils presento.  good-oh!

[19:27] *** guifa joined
[19:27] <guifa> actually better question re NativeCall: is there any way I can just pass a Raku object as a pointer to be able to pass it back to a callback?

[19:28] <guifa> it seems like it'll need to be repr(CStruct) but then you lose the ability to have full attributes

[19:42] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: I just realised the link to my post is pointing to a different place.

[19:47] <guifa> if not I'll just have to come up with some other system using id codes or something

[20:05] *** librasteve_ left
[20:21] <Voldenet> guifa: I think there's no way around it, because you'd have to somehow mark the object as non-GC a'la `explicitly-manage`, which can only handle strings

[20:22] <Voldenet> otherwise you'd risk freeing the object used by native code anyway

[20:22] <guifa> yeah, in this case there wouldn't be any issue because the teardown would happen between two objects at the same time, so there wouldn't be the chance

[20:24] <guifa> basically for each Raku object there's a single ObjC object

[20:24] <guifa> I can store the pointer for the ObjC one in Raku land but not the other way around

[20:26] <guifa> I'll just create an incrementing id attribute for the Raku object and then pass that to the Obj-C one to send of each time.  If the type keeps it all in a nice list it won't require toooooo much spaghettiness

[20:31] *** arkiuat left
[20:33] <Voldenet> yeah, something like https://0x0.st/8RcH.raku but maybe with spaghetti-free

[20:34] <guifa> egads 

[20:34] <guifa> yeah I'm going to try to keep it a bit cleaner since there will be a lot of methods haha

[20:34] <guifa> but I think I'm spending 10x the time on trying to do that cleanliness

[20:41] <Voldenet> I simply had to make that SpaghettiPtr class joke ;>

[20:43] *** arkiuat joined
[20:49] <guifa> tell me you already had that available

[20:49] <guifa> and that wasn't something you made on the spot lol

[21:10] <guifa> hrmmm... SIGSEGV

[21:25] <disbot4> <librasteve> Voldenet: https://github.com/librasteve/Air/issues/24 ‚Ä¶ thanks for point on hx-post   written manually ‚Ä¶ i made an issue and will take a proper look later this week

[22:25] <disbot4> <melezhik.> [Coke]: just in case I would like to mention that zef-fetch sparrow plugin does invoke zef look command - https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow-plugins/blob/23a692a5cbae56c48e09dca72987b6140fc9509c/zef-fetch/task.bash#L11 , it‚Äôs just a matter of additional recursive copy command to copy this random temp directory to any desired location

[22:27] <disbot4> <melezhik.> But yeah one can run zef look command directly as well
