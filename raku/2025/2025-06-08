[04:14] <Voldenet> erry: I use raku for scripting at work, but I do mostly scripting on the side, because nobody else can even read it ‚Äì most "production" code is in csharp, java and typesscript

[04:21] <Voldenet> the problem with raku is a bit like stack-oriented languages, you can do a lot very quickly and without typing much, but because of that it's too difficult for most people

[04:24] <Voldenet> to the point where I can imagine that production use of raku would be somewhat simplified - short DSL libraries, no custom grammars, hardly any smart ops use

[04:25] <Voldenet> oversimplified to the point that it looks like ajva

[08:06] <wayland76> librasteve: Just saw your article at https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2024/11/13/raku-perl-a-reconciliation/ and wanted to mention that, while you probably already know it, every cPanel machine has to have Perl because cPanel is in Perl.  :)  

[08:11] <wayland76> erry: I was going to say that your approach should probably be to use langchain for a private project, then list yourself with langchain experience (and note that it's for a private project).  HTH,

[08:14] <wayland76> Also, for the "Raku at work" thing, I mostly don't, but I *did* use it for a firewall replacement project where I wanted to translate the firewalling code from one firewall language to another.  

[08:14] <wayland76> The main reason I don't use it at work is because we're a PHP house, and it's deemed useful for others to be able to understand my code.

[11:32] <disbot1> <librasteve> erry: yes

[11:32] <disbot1> <librasteve> but it's quite big

[11:32] <erry> Nice

[11:32] <erry> Raku*

[11:33] <erry> That's what she said

[11:33] <disbot1> <librasteve> comfortable = Larry Wall (the designer) was a linguist ... so it reads like nouns, verbs, adverbs, possessive and so on

[11:34] *** yewscion joined
[11:38] *** yewscion left
[11:39] <erry> Is it Ê•Ω

[11:39] <erry> Nvm that's too complicated a pun

[11:43] <refactus> well, it *can* read somewhat like natural language. depends on how you write. imo it's "comfortable" in that it is highly multiparadigm, allows you to code in whatever style suits you best

[11:45] <erry> Nevermind :)

[11:45] <erry> Speaking of linguists I played around with NLP and stuff recently 

[11:45] <erry> Fun stuff

[11:46] <erry> I like certain natural languages myself, but only really messed up ones 

[11:53] <refactus> yeah I wasn't responding to your pun, just adding to what librasteve said. I only know one human language, other than a few numbers in spanish and thai, and a touch of german from listening to rammstein and eisbrecher

[11:55] <refactus> plenty of people here speak multiple languages, a large portion of them are from europe. but it's pretty quiet right now

[12:55] <disbot1> <antononcube> @erry ‚ÄúIs Raku confortable‚Äù ‚Äî No, it is not. It was made ‚Äî like Perl ‚Äî by a linguist who likes English, hence, thinking that (deep) inconsistencies of a language are fine.

[12:58] <disbot1> <antononcube> You can read that Raku is ‚Äústrangely consistent‚Äù, which means it is ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù. Especially, for people coming to Raku from (currently) popular programming languages. (E.g. Python.)

[12:58] <[Coke]> Perhaps a matter of taste.

[12:58] <disbot1> <antononcube> Perhaps, a matter of fact.

[13:01] <[Coke]> Is that what your LLM tells you?

[13:02] <disbot1> <antononcube> @Coke üôÇ Interesting statement! See here: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube . What percentage of these 83  Raku packages are about / for LLM ?

[13:07] <disbot1> <antononcube> Until few years ago Raku was pretty useless for Machine Learning and Data Science. Useless, not just "uncomfortable".

[13:07] *** ACfromTX joined
[13:08] <disbot1> <antononcube> So, generally speaking, Raku is also "uncomfortable" because of its small ecosystem. (Again, especially, for people coming to Raku from languages like Python.)

[13:23] <refactus> coming from python to many other languages will be uncomfortable. same with coming from many other languages to python. and I really can't agree with holding your *opinions* as fact. stangely consistent != inconsistent, it means the set of consistencies and inconsistencies are a different set of tradeoffs from many other languages. "consistency" isn't a single axis, nor is it the only goal of a

[13:23] <refactus> language

[13:23] <refactus> the other issue here is that "confortable" is a pretty subjective concept open to interretation, so the question is rather vague

[13:24] <refactus> *comfortable

[13:26] <refactus> *interpretation. guess I can't type today

[13:31] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus I agree 100% with your languages and comfortability statements above. But where did I say that I hold my ‚Äúopinions as facts‚Äù?

[13:31] <refactus> "<antononcube> Perhaps, a matter of fact." or perhaps I misunderstood

[13:34] <disbot1> <antononcube> It starts with the word "perhaps", right?

[13:35] <refactus> I think perhaps I misunderstood your intention with that one. there's a few different ways it could be read, I probably picked the wrong one

[13:36] <disbot1> <antononcube> Yeah, it is hard from just what it is written to judge the intention/attitude...

[13:37] <refactus> apologies if I misjudged, didn't mean to pick on you

[13:38] <disbot1> <antononcube> It is fine! I am curious about how I would define a fact in terms of this discussion.

[13:39] <refactus> well that's the real problem. what is "comfortable" in a language is vague and subjective

[13:40] <refactus> saying there is a parger ecosystem for python, I can totally accept that as fact :)

[13:40] <refactus> *larger

[13:40] <refactus> (not sure but I think I shocked my keyboard with static one too many times, I swear I know how to type)

[13:41] <disbot1> <antononcube> The only approach to make "meaningful" arguments on language confortability with some level of objectivity is alluded here: https://xkcd.com/539/ .

[13:43] <disbot1> <antononcube> Not necessary a good one, BTW. But it is easy and cheap. (In both senses, perhaps.)

[13:43] <refactus> ha! reduce it to your own area of study, real fair :)

[13:46] <refactus> I guess I would then rephrase what I said earlier to, across the spectrum of programming languages in common use, python is the outlier at least in terms of syntax. of course you might argue that python is more used and we should weight by number of users

[13:50] <refactus> I think we need a highly multidimensional statistical analysis of the available data against all contextually plausible interpretations of "comfortable" to settle this. in a jupyter notebook

[13:51] <Voldenet> erry: raku is more than comfortable, it's a paradise for coders ;)

[13:52] <disbot1> <antononcube> Right! And the average age of those set of coders is 56.

[13:53] <Voldenet> Well, y'know, young people don't there too early nowadays

[13:53] <Voldenet> don't go, even

[13:53] <erry> See, raku (Ê•Ω) means comfortable in Japanese. And 10000 other things probably 

[13:53] <erry> I'm very intelligent

[13:53] <Voldenet> the language name `rakudo` literally means paradise

[13:53] <Voldenet> >Ê•ΩÂúü

[13:53] <erry> Yes

[13:54] <erry> Indeed

[13:54] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus Yeah, agreed. I made a similar multidimensional statistical study one year ago: https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2024/05/25/age-at-creation-for-programming-languages-stats/

[13:54] <erry> I see what you did

[13:54] <erry> I should have known that word 

[13:54] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus (And I know what you did there!!)

[13:54] <erry> I have to sit the Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûËÉΩÂäõË©¶È®ìÔΩéÔºì in 1 month

[13:54] <erry> D:

[13:54] <erry> At least that's going well

[13:54] <erry> The opposite of my career

[13:54] <Voldenet> hehe good luck

[13:55] <erry> Too bad that can't make me money

[13:55] <erry> Sulk.

[13:55] <Voldenet> fun things rarely pay

[13:55] <Voldenet> paying things are rarely fun

[13:56] <disbot1> <antononcube> ü§î hmm... right, of course.

[13:56] <disbot1> <antononcube> @erry> "I'm very intelligent" -- so, it seems... And you like my LLM packages!

[13:59] <erry> Yes please hire me

[13:59] <Voldenet> though I wonder if you should know rakudo, erry, it's not a common word at all

[13:59] <erry> I'll even write perl

[13:59] <erry> Going into real desperation now

[13:59] <Voldenet> common for it is n1 level, tengoku

[14:00] <erry> I know tengoku

[14:00] <erry> And jigoku

[14:00] <erry> I've seen the latter myself 

[14:00] <Voldenet> python is jigoku

[14:00] <erry> Lol

[14:01] *** librasteve_ left
[14:01] <disbot1> <antononcube> Hmm...  I think I know these words too. (I think I recognize their kanji-writing faster.)

[14:03] <Voldenet> as non-native I recognize their romaji the fastest

[14:07] <disbot1> <antononcube> @erry I will keep it mind.

[14:08] <refactus> antononcube: you really did do something rather thorough there, didn't you? I'm not sure precisely what without reading it all, but it sure has enough graphs

[14:09] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus The presentation video might "more fun" (‚âà23 min) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnjMVSfT8w

[14:11] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus You can see in one of the bubble charts that J and Raku are clear outliers. üôÇ

[14:14] <refactus> antononcube: I might look at it later, I don't mind reading. reading is how I've learned much of what I know. my head is just in other directions today. have to take the garbage to the transfer station soon, then untarp some things since the rain is over for now, and clean the carbuerator on the lawn mower because it hasn't ran right since I pulled it out this year

[14:15] <disbot1> <antononcube> Unfortunately, most (popular) graphics systems do not support 3D graphics, so for now Raku does not have 3D graphics production abilities. But with 3D bubble chart, in a dynamic environment (i.e. notebook) the outliers are really interesting to see. (For example, here: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3180327 .)

[14:16] <refactus> antononcube: I might look at it later, I don't mind reading. reading is how I've learned much of what I know. my head is just in other directions today. have to take the garbage to the transfer station soon, then untarp some things since the rain is over for now, and clean the carbuerator on the lawn mower because it hasn't ran right since I pulled it out this year

[14:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> Ok, the author of that dataset keeps certain popularity related data and measurements. I.e. that data is suitable for the "statistically significant other" approach to "comfortability."

[14:22] <refactus> antononcube: when I rotate in firefox it just turns the whole chart into one big sphere

[14:22] <refactus> but I really do have to go for a bit, sadly. look forward to chatting with you again
