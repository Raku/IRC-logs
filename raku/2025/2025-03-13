[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> antonantonov: maybe we need to cooperate somehow - LLM ( your stuff) and Sparrow for unstructured texts analysis üßê

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a Raku package for doing RAG. It has been in my TODO list for at least 6 months to make RAG database from the Raku documentation.

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> LLM can be used to generate Sparrow (scripting) code in several ways: - Using Big(ger) LLM prompt / persona - Via examples

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Or a combination of the two.

[16:02] *** melezhik joined
[16:06] <melezhik> oh, i thouhgt something opposite ) , like we have a user input / logs files as unstructured raw input, we can think about standard Sparrow analyzers tools to extract / transform this data into something more meaningful that could be a basis for LLM RAG, so that we could enrich the raw data by Sparrow, though this is my very unprofessional view, and you might know this much better )) 

[16:06] <melezhik> by standard Sparrow analyzers tools I mean this - https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6/blob/master/documentation/taskchecks.md

[16:07] <melezhik> we have a lightweight DSL built on top of Raku "vanila" regexps

[16:07] <melezhik> recently i've added few intersting features like - negations , replace , zoom , soft checks , etc
