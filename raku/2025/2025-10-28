[00:51] <ugexe> i am guessing the rakudo star problem is because it installs its modules to the 'vendor' repo, and for whatever reason the staging repo doesn't work right with that (although from my understanding it should be fine)

[00:51] *** arkiuat joined
[00:52] <ugexe> so you end up with the staging repo zef generates that is for the 'site' repo (where modules are usually installed) but references dependencies in 'vendor' repo. so its like 3 layers deep in repos

[06:17] *** arkiuat joined
[06:20] <disbot1> <librasteve> @aruniecrisps I would like to see DataStar implemented with Air … my very vague knowledge is that someone (sorry can’t recall who) has been prototyping SSE with raku. At a 30000’ level I would like to see SSE hooked up to Cromponents (which as you likely know underpins the Air::Component module) in a way that you can add reactive code to a Component and wire it up to the DOM via Raku Supplies or Channels. Suggest you

[06:20] <disbot1> fork Air and write the nicest possible DataStar SSE implementation probably avoiding Air::Component … eg make something analogous called Air:: Element … for now. When that is working, then we can work out how to reintegrate everything…??

[08:16] <ab5tract> librasteve: I keep mentioning SSE

[08:17] <ab5tract> so I'm probably the guilty party :)

[08:17] <ab5tract> The protocol specification at least is super simple

[08:17] <wayland76> Question: https://docs.raku.org/type/Metamodel/C3MRO says "C3 is the default resolution order for classes and grammars in Raku".  Does that mean that a different order can be used?

[08:17] <ab5tract> it's basically "data: {self.data

[08:18] <ab5tract> it's basically "data: {self.data}\n\n"

[08:18] <ab5tract> inside an http packet

[08:18] <ab5tract> I haven't actually implemented it yet though

[08:19] <ab5tract> wayland76: I do not think core provides any other MROs, but I might be mistaken

[08:19] <ab5tract> from the metamodel code, it's not clear how pluggable it really is

[08:21] <ab5tract> antononcube: the rip plugin has code that does this

[08:23] <ab5tract> https://github.com/ab5tract/raku-intellij-plugin/blob/main/src/main/java/org/raku/comma/services/support/moduleDetails/ModuleListFetcher.kt

[08:24] <wayland76> ab5tract: Thanks!  Yes, I haven't seen any others.  I was hoping it'd be, if not pluggable, then at least overridable (ie. in a Slang)

[08:25] <ab5tract> oh for sure it is in theory swappable

[08:25] <ab5tract> As with all pieces of the metamodel

[08:25] <ab5tract> how well that works in practice ...

My main board is currently on a Moonlander, and I've gone QWERTY-like, but with extra layers.  One of the things I've done is that matching punctuation (eg. parentheses) is in the same place on opposite hands; left opens, right closes.

[10:02] <wayland76> If people haven't seen the keyboardio that Coke offered, I'd urge them to take a look.  If I didn't already have a Moonlander, I'd be asking for it :) .  

[10:05] <wayland76> Anyway, thanks everyone for your feedback on the Raku keyboard layout.  No-one's complaining that their favourite symbol has been left out, so I'm going to take that as a good sign :) .  

[10:09] <wayland76> librasteve_: Any particular recommendations?  I'm seeing some in your various measurement modules.  

[10:19] <disbot1> <librasteve> not really … i am slowly drifting toward ascii only (already there with App::Crag) … I would say keep a ° (degree) symbol somewhere handy is about the only one

[14:40] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Also I do need to get around to making a job queue library for Raku

[14:41] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve sure, my plan for datastar is to create three levels of integrations: one standalone library with the basics, an integration at the Cro level and one at the Air level

[14:41] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> The standalone library is what has already been releasrd

[14:41] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Released

[14:44] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> My Cro::Datastar library is going to basically have helper functions for getting headers and params out from Datastar specific requests

[14:45] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> And then Air::Jetstream (the Air integration) is probably going to have helper functions for generating Datastar attributes and valuesn

[14:45] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Values

[14:46] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> Also another thing on my to-do list is to finally get around to making that pattern matching Slang

[17:23] <timo> uh, not the failure mode i expected

[17:25] <Voldenet> the approach with ranges is in practice 2x faster :)

[17:25] <timo> :D

[17:25] <timo> the nested maps one?

[17:26] <Voldenet> yeah

[17:26] <timo> m: sub sliding-iterate(*@n) { my $c = +@n; @n[(^$c).map({ 0..^$_, $_, $_^..^$c })] }; sliding-iterate(<a b c d>).say

[17:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 44bb652dc: OUTPUT: «((a (b c d)) ((a) b (c d)) ((a b) c (d)) ((a b c) d))␤»

[17:27] <timo> no need for the nested map, even

[17:27] <timo> though it doesn't give the empty list at the start or end in this one

[17:28] <ab5tract_> that's pretty nice to read

[17:29] <timo> that may be unacceptable that the empty lists are thrown out for the first and last entry of the result

[17:29] <Voldenet> and last approach is a bit slower in practice

[17:29] <Voldenet> (well it allocates, obviously)

[17:32] <Voldenet> since the problem is about `for ^@n { @n.say }` and having 3 constant iterators with common storage that only iterates using index multiple times

[17:32] <Voldenet> well, two indexes

[17:32] <Voldenet> the outer and inner

[17:32] <Voldenet> it can be probably written as class and be very optimized

[17:36] <ab5tract_> Voldenet: true, there is (at least) an axis each for beauty and for elegance

[17:56] <Voldenet> also, the "what is the fastest" will also depend on how it's used

[18:21] <ab5tract> irccloud benefits in the beauty of Halloy? can it really be possible?

[18:22] <[Coke]> Anyone have a pointer on what an HTTP::UserAgent delete would look like with a json body?

[18:22] <[Coke]> (how to write the call)

[18:26] <[Coke]> I have an API I need to call that is a DELETE that takes some input in query params (easy) and some in a JSON body

[18:26] <[Coke]> (wondering if I need to switch from using that module to something else)

[18:26] <Voldenet> HTTP::Request.new('DELETE', URI.new('http://foo.com/bar'), HTTP::Header.new(Foo => 'bar'))

[18:34] <[Coke]> for the body, though... .add-content?

[18:35] <[Coke]> and then how to fire it?

[18:39] <perryprog> Thanks for all the fun responses! I was also trying to do it in a fancy reduce way but I agree that just doing the imperative ranges is quite clear

[18:39] <perryprog> I continue to love how easy it is to nerd snipe this channel :)

[18:40] <Voldenet> either add-content or add-form-data on HTTP::Request, then HTTP::UserAgent has send-request method that accepts the request

[18:40] <Voldenet> and returns response

[18:41] <[Coke]> perfect. Danke!

[18:43] <Voldenet> perryprog: it's a fun problem actually, so no wonder everyone's interested – I've even asked gpt to generate optimized version, but let's just say it wasn't what I hoped for :D

[18:44] <perryprog> Yeah it's one of those things that feels like it might have a really clean solution

[18:49] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @cokebot9000 Would you consider using Cro::HTTP::Client?   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78809044/how-to-override-default-content-type-in-crohttpclient/78813313#78813313

[18:50] <[Coke]> In a future rewrite, sure. This is some "legacy" stuff I'm using for work, and am just trying to get the job done right now, not shave a yak

[18:50] <[Coke]> ALso: while I am both [Coke] and @cokebot9000, if I'm posting as one, you're better off replying to that one. :)

[18:50] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @perryprog I learned something. Thanks.

[18:52] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @coke-or-new-coke I'm on Discord...not sure I can reply to your IRC messages directly?

[18:54] <Voldenet> not-really-clean solution from gpt :P https://0x0.st/K_KF.raku

[18:55] <Voldenet> I did some poking around it to understand it more, but I doubt it's sane solution

[18:57] <Voldenet> It's probably fast (that's what I asked for) but difficult to use otherwise
