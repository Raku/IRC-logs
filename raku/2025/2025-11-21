[14:32] <Voldenet> sadly, the reality is that it's faster to add improvements to forked project and never merge it back

[14:33] <Voldenet> I do that too, especially when my changes would be controversial

[15:02] <arkiuat> Voldenet, so I guess that's what leads to the "rust-like situation where you have N libs for basic stuff" that you mentioned the other day

[15:05] *** melezhik_ left
[15:05] *** melezhik_ joined
[15:06] <ugexe> i imagine the N libs problem i other languages is moreso because of resume driven development

[15:09] <Voldenet> arkiuat: actually, rust has insanely frugal stdlib

[15:09] <disbot4> <antononcube> For the record, my Raku development efforts are very "resume driven."

[15:09] <Voldenet> it can be fixed, of course, dotnet has this problem for no json library for a while, so many libraries for json were built over time

[15:11] <Voldenet> but then dotnet team picked the most popular library, borrowed a lot of apis from it, implemented it in the stdlib and in the end, people gradually stop using old json libs

[15:13] <Voldenet> forks are hardly a problem in all this, most approaches are rewrites of the same thing

[15:14] <Voldenet> but the lesson learned IMO is that large stdlib is good

[15:15] <disbot4> <antononcube> Isn't another lesson to just avoid Rust?

[15:39] <ugexe> why would one avoid rust if that is the best tool for the job

[15:40] *** hvxgr joined
[15:45] <Voldenet> Not entirely, but rust libs requiring 90 dependencies are no-go

[15:45] <melezhik_> .

[15:45] <melezhik_> Some people keep using Sparky/Raku to test RL distribution - fresh repos - https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-chyrp/tree/main

[15:46] <melezhik_> https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-nfs

[15:46] <melezhik_> https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-dnf

[15:47] <Voldenet> nice

[15:48] <melezhik_> especially I am exited they use Sparrow6 Check DSL everywhere - https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-dnf/blob/main/tasks/dnf-test/task.check

[15:48] <melezhik_> excited )

[15:48] <Voldenet> yeah, check dsl looks as minimal as it gets

[15:49] <melezhik_> this allow write check commands on bash and then just checks the output whatever comes out - https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-chyrp/blob/main/tasks/chyrp-test/task.check

[15:50] <Voldenet> hm, so that means you can pretty much copy the valid output to checks?

[15:52] <melezhik_> the output is generated by task.bash command - https://github.com/ctrliq/sparky-chyrp/blob/main/tasks/chyrp-test/task.bash

[15:52] <melezhik_> STDOUT to be accurate 

[15:52] <melezhik_> this is kinda black box testing 

[15:53] <melezhik_> or I have a better term for it - "message oriented testing"

[15:53] <melezhik_> or "small talk testing" )) 

[15:54] <Voldenet> I like it, it's how people test things ;)

[15:54] <melezhik_> so systems communicate with each other by saying things , it's does not matter what's inside of every black box, but we just rely on fact that if system behaves correctly it says correct phrases 

[15:54] <melezhik_> "I like it, it's how people test things ;)" - yup

[15:54] <melezhik_> it works well for fast tests development 

[15:55] <melezhik_> also check dsl allows checks things like sequential phrases , Raku regexes in phrases or phases between phrases ... 

[15:56] <melezhik_> also for phase producers like Bash where we are limited by programming language itself we simplify testing by just producing valid output where it's structured or not

[23:06] <[Coke]> hey, the docs site has several sections for "coming to raku from language <x>" - would love it if we had volunteers to "own" those language sections, to edit them (esp. the p5 ones!), make sure the examples are great, etc.

[23:06] <[Coke]> is:issue state:open label:"other language"
