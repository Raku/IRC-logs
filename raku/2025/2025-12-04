[02:51] <disbot6> <frostcod> Hi, I am reading today's raku advent, and what's going on here?

[02:51] <disbot6> <frostcod> what's going on here

[02:51] <disbot6> <frostcod> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1445970732025774122/image.png?ex=693248af&is=6930f72f&hm=9882c4940afcd324c461bb9b8f5e5eb21bdb1777bfbef11e588c2319ee6653be&

[03:12] <Voldenet> jubilatious1_98524: it's already there in Promise, but I'd argue that it serves similar purpose for promises

[03:15] *** hulk left

[03:17] <Voldenet> m: 2 + 3 andthen * + 5 andthen * ** 2 andthen .say

[03:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar cfaee8a09: OUTPUT: «100␤»

[03:19] <Voldenet> m: await Promise.kept(2 + 3).andthen({ .result.Int + 5 }).andthen({ .result.Int ** 2 }).andthen({ .result.say })

[03:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar cfaee8a09: OUTPUT: «100␤»

[03:19] <Voldenet> new andthen lifting simply removes that .result

[03:19] <Voldenet> because this is only invoked when you get the result and promise is kept

[03:20] *** arkiuat joined
[03:21] <Voldenet> and since it's not specified yet, it can be fully changed

[03:26] *** arkiuat left
[03:26] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Voldenet My question is more general: are there design principles in Raku that guard against mistakes that were made with Perl? There were many complaints about 'overloading' in Perl, and I thought the Raku designers decided to steer clear of that.

[03:28] <Voldenet> …overloading?

[03:30] <Voldenet> that's why I explicitly stated that nobody is proposing to change andthen

[03:43] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> But you create  confusion in the minds of new users who now have to differentiate dotted-.andthen from undotted-andthen. So you are "overloading" andthen (by adding the dotted"-.andthen form) even if it might not bother you so much.

[03:43] <Voldenet> well: https://github.com/Raku/old-design-docs/blob/master/S13-overloading.pod

[03:46] *** arkiuat joined
[03:47] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Well, you're talking programming and I'm talking linguistics. English has ~500,000 (?) words: can't you pick another one? What's wrong with the .subsequently() and .non-subsequently() keywords I suggested on Github?

[03:48] <Voldenet> it's very lengthy and difficult to type

[03:48] <Voldenet> I'd rather have js-esque .then/.catch

[03:48] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> My goodness!

[03:49] <Voldenet> but .then is already taken and specified, unfortunately

[03:50] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Why does Raku have to be like C++ or js?  Why can't you have Raku autocomplete make light work of it?

[03:50] <Voldenet> it's still lengthy

[03:51] *** melezhik_ joined
[03:52] <Voldenet> because of that, you get monstrosities like `await Promise.kept(2 + 3).subsequently({ .Int + 5 }).subsequently({ .Int ** 2 }).subsequently({ .say })`

[03:52] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Oh yeah, andthen and notandthen are taken, too. They have nothing to do with Promises. If you want people to activate a different part of their brain when working with Promises, give them a different vocabulary to play with.

[03:53] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> m: "andthen".chars.say; "subsequently".chars.say;

[03:53] <Voldenet> on the other hand having different api for very similar purpose

[03:54] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> 5-character difference.

[03:54] <Voldenet> it's a lot when working with promises

[03:55] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> m: "notandthen".chars.say; "non-subsequently".chars.say;

[03:55] <Voldenet> wait wait, "notandthen"?

[03:55] <Voldenet> .orelse

[03:55] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> 6-character difference.

[03:56] *** melezhik_ left
[03:56] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> The converse of andthen is notandthen. This is where your proposal will confuse the he** out of new users.

[03:57] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> https://docs.raku.org/routine/notandthen

[03:57] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_notandthen

[03:58] <Voldenet> I'm not against having different naming

[03:58] <Voldenet> but it'd be nice to have it sane

[03:59] <Voldenet> and not do-on-kept({ }).do-on-broken({ })

[03:59] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Sane...I agree!

[03:59] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Ouch!

[04:00] <Voldenet> also, newcomers won't be able to use promises at all

[04:01] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> brb...

[04:06] <Voldenet> sadly, I've seen seasoned programmers not using jquery's animations properly because of promises-based api

[04:06] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> The point is to not scare-off new users by having documentation that is too difficult to read, what might be called "Snake-Eyes Syndrome".

[04:07] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> The blithe term "snake-eyes" comes from Steve Yegge's analysis of Perl's .. "Range Operator" : https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-perl

[04:14] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Yegge points out that it takes ~530 words to explain to a new user how to use the .. operator properly. Some learn it, some don't even try.

[04:19] <Voldenet> heh, there's healthy balance between convenience and simplicity and perl took the convenience route on every turn

[04:20] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> I'm not trying to harsh on Perl.

[04:23] <Voldenet> I know, the point is that raku is not especially striving for convenience

[04:23] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> What about .affirmed and .excused ?

[04:27] <Voldenet> long, uncommon

[04:29] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Long?

[04:30] <Voldenet> I'd think of something like `.ok/.do/.got .fail/.err/.oops`

[04:30] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> (Oh for anyone reading along at home, I vehemently disagree with Yegge's attack on Larry Wall. Full stop.).

[04:31] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> My goodness!

[04:31] <Voldenet> or more verbose .apply/.rescue

[04:33] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> You affirm a promise, or make an excuse why one was broken.

[04:34] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Better yet, a Promise is eventually fulfilled  or unfulfilled.

[04:35] <Voldenet> essentially, you .map the result or cause of the error

[04:35] <Voldenet> and promise is kept or broken

[04:35] <Voldenet> except, of course, Any.map is taken

[04:35] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> According to whom? JS-people?

[04:36] <Voldenet> in raku, it's already how it is

[04:37] <Voldenet> js calls it 'fullfilled' or 'rejected' and you have Promise.resolve to create fulfilled promise ;>

[04:38] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Hopefully JS spelled it fulfilled. I'd hate to think they've been needlessly typing an extra character! 😃

[04:39] <Voldenet> fulfilled, even ;D

[04:39] <Voldenet> fully filled

[04:39] *** lichtkind_ joined
[04:40] <Voldenet> but of course, js has .then/.catch for promises

[04:40] <Voldenet> and you rarely see "fulfilled" anywhere

[04:42] *** lichtkind left
[04:43] <Voldenet> rust has .ok_then and .err_then, that is nice

[04:44] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> It's pretty short compared to the German translation: bekräftigen and entschuldigen.

[04:52] *** melezhik_ joined
[04:52] <Voldenet> .yay .nay, very playful but I'd have no idea what it does

[04:55] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> I'm confused about tense then. In Grammars you have make and made, but with Promises you have kept without keep.

[04:56] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Shouldn't it be keep(): kept, unkept?

[04:56] *** melezhik_ left
[04:57] <Voldenet> not only java is terrible, in C# there's promises api that I avoid with all my might

[04:58] <Voldenet> verbose and inconvenient - shares many qualities with raku's `then`

[05:01] <Voldenet> unkept would imply that the api hasn't finished

[05:01] <Voldenet> so you have <Planned Kept Broken>

[05:02] <Voldenet> Unkept would mean Planned or Broken

[05:03] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> So why did you write  await Promise.kept(2 + 3). yada yada yada?

[05:04] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Should that be `await Promise.planned(2 + 3).

[05:04] <Voldenet> Well, you create promise that's already in state "Kept"

[05:04] <Voldenet> so it's kept already

[05:06] <Voldenet> with .broken you create one that's already broken - planned is the one that was not finished

[05:06] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524>  await Promise.planned(2 + 3) ?? do-this !! do-that;

[05:08] <Voldenet> promise is already settled, you schedule what to do after it's kept or broken

[05:10] <Voldenet> in fact `Promise.kept(2 + 3).&await andthen .say` would work

[06:51] <ab5tract> keep is a method on Vow

[06:52] <ab5tract> I honestly had never seen notandthen and I have no idea what the point of it is.

[06:52] <ab5tract> m: 0 notandthen “what”.say

[06:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar cfaee8a09: ( no output )

[06:54] <ab5tract> Is there any difference between notandthen and orelse?

[06:54] <ab5tract> Both require undefined

[06:54] <ab5tract> The argument that andthen/orelse cannot be reused is not very convincing IMO

[06:55] *** melezhik_ joined
[06:55] <ab5tract> We re-use language terms for similar uses all the time

[06:55] <ab5tract> See the statement modifier forms of if/for/unless

[06:56] <ab5tract> Or start vs Promise.start

[06:59] *** melezhik_ left
[06:59] <ab5tract> Okay, this documentation rings a bell, now that I've had a sip of coffee: https://docs.raku.org/routine/notandthen

[07:00] <ab5tract> "The notandthen operator is a close relative of the without statement modifier, and some compilers compile without to notandthen, meaning these two lines have equivalent behavior:"

[07:00] <ab5tract> great, thanks, I really needed a different but (maybe) equal syntax 

[07:03] <ab5tract> "At first glance, notandthen might appear to be the same thing as the orelse operator. The difference is subtle: notandthen returns Empty when it encounters a defined item (that isn't the last item), whereas orelse returns that item."

[07:04] <ab5tract> This kind of keyword is exactly the kind of design creep that gave Perl its difficult reputation

[07:05] <ab5tract> Any time an example needs to use a reduce operator to demonstrate some difference between two operators, an angel loses its wings and is banished to the hell of compiler maintenance

[07:05] <ab5tract> And I'm all out of wings

[07:36] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> You're calling it design creep but it is because under some circumstances Raku enforces binary logic, while under other circumstances Raku enforces ternary logic. The pair notandthen vs orelse illustrates this dichotomy.

[08:44] <ab5tract> It seems just as likely to inspire even more hallucination

[08:44] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524>  ~$ raku -e 'my @a = 1...14; for @a -> $a,$b { print ($a,$b,"\t"); ($a.is-prime orelse $b.is-prime).say };' 1 2     False 3 4     True 5 6     True 7 8     True 9 10     False 11 12     True 13 14     True

[08:45] <ab5tract> I don't see any utility over grepping for 

[08:45] <ab5tract> False and replacing with Empty

[08:46] <ab5tract> but clearly I'm not the intended user of notandthen

[08:46] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Maybe an easier example for the notandthen Docs page?

[08:47] <ab5tract> Could be.. but 

[08:47] <ab5tract> the sensors version has a "story" to it, which is kind of nice

[08:48] <ab5tract> FWIW I've only ever understood this operator family to be useful when one wants to topicalize the LHS for use on the RHS

[08:49] <ab5tract> So probably there is a lack of imagination on my part as to the utility of these things

[08:53] *** evalable6 left
[08:54] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> I'm trying to rewrite the examples I posted to return a prime number or () Empty, as opposed to prime number and 0. I think that's sort-of the intended use? I'll probably have to pick it up again tomorrow.

[09:01] <ab5tract> Thanks for your efforts here, jubi (may I call you that? your Discord name is hard to type out in its entirety) 

[09:02] <ab5tract> I wonder if its better to add your example as a clarifier in the docs, rather than a replacement

[09:03] <ab5tract> My thinking here is that it eases the pressure off of your example to carry the weight of the entire explanation

[09:04] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> (I've seen people type J1 ... if that helps).

[09:05] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> (or j1, or j-one. TMTOWTDI).

[09:09] <ab5tract> Right now the docs are lacking an example which demonstrates the difference between orelse and notandthen when not chained

HARC can already deal well with code highlighting and markdown content (on raku.org), and Richard showed me a draft of his Rakudoc Air::Component last weekend ... SmokeMachine has

[14:26] <disbot6> added permissions to Cromponent routes (v0.0.14), but I have not had a chance to move the pin up from 0.0.13 yet (Air::Component is a wrapper on Cromponent), arun is working on Red migrations. There is a well defined Air::Plugin interface (we can already exchange Rakudoc and HARC stack plugins such as Hilite). We are already at a point where if you want a custom component to (say) embed a PDF or a Jupyter Notebook viewer, then if you can

[14:26] <disbot6> render it to HTML you can write one. Let me know and I will happily support that effort.

[18:15] <Voldenet> pdf has binary compressed blobs of text, polygons, images, describes absolute coordinates - it's basically forcing the screen to render scrollable paper of specified format

[18:15] <Voldenet> and rendering markdown into html is surprisingly difficult, because of multiple markdown flavors, \t and \n in random order being interpreted differently :/

[18:17] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: on PDF, I agree - I gather that tom's use case would be to write a blog post as a PDF and then to translate it to HTML and serve as a webpage - I 110% agree that this is going to look very bad thanks to the reasons you outline

[18:21] <Voldenet> an interesting thing for html - libreoffice writer has "preview in browser" option that renders pretty good html

[18:22] <Voldenet> the result is not perfect, but it's quite clean

[18:22] <disbot6> <librasteve> otoh, I think it is fairly common to see PDF files served as a webpage - or embedded in a page (often in a viewer where you can scroll / page)

[18:24] <Voldenet> it's convenient for documents that are supposed to be printed, but doesn't render well on mobile sadly

[18:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> where I depart from is Markdown - I think if you simply use markdown as originally specified (# => h1, ## => h2, - => ul, links and so on) then it maps 1:1 to HTML and is much nicer to type and to read in the source

[18:40] <[Coke]> I agree on markdown for simple formatting. easy, short.

[18:48] <Voldenet> in markdown if you for example have blocks of code inside numbered lists, numbered lists may get reset or not for example, depending on the markdown parser

[18:49] <Voldenet> or if you have tables

[18:49] <[Coke]> Yup, that's already too complex, agrred

[18:50] <disbot6> <librasteve> ++++

[18:50] <Voldenet> that's why for anything more complex I prefer html directly

[18:52] *** melezhik left
[18:54] <disbot6> <antononcube> HTML code can be used in Markdown files.

[18:55] <disbot6> <antononcube> Also, as far as I know tables are not standard Markdown feature.

[18:56] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hence, using HTML tables makes sense. To a large extend that is why I implemented "Data::Translators", to be able to render Raku data structures to HTML,

[18:56] <disbot6> <antononcube> R, Python, etc.

[18:57] <disbot6> <antononcube> So, Raku arrays of hashmaps can be converted to HTML tables.

[19:00] <tbrowder> chatgpt tells me prog pdf2htmlEX was pretty good

[19:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm... ChatGPT can probably convert PDF to HTML pretty well. But for these conversions I would use pandoc. (Which may or may not use other pdf* programs.

[19:05] <Voldenet> yeah tables are not standard sadly, so using html is valid idea too

[19:06] <disbot6> <librasteve> haha - I am very happy to support anyone to make a HARC plugin to do anything ...

[19:10] <disbot6> <librasteve> HARC uses Text::Markdown ... no tables yet ...

[19:12] <tbrowder> hm, git markdown does tables...

[19:12] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve If your HARC uses my "Markdown::Grammar" then it will have tables.

[19:13] <disbot6> <antononcube> @tbrowder Yes, GitHub supports tables and Mermaid diagrams. Very useful for documentation...

[20:27] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube - I have swapped out Text::Markdown for Markdown::Grammar - md tables now work (part of a major upgrade to Air so will take a few days to filter through)

[20:33] <tbrowder> bril: @antonaoncube could improve Pod::To::Markdown

[20:43] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube I guess this will work for jupyter -> html ...  BUT the use case for markdown is "I am making a HARC stack website, I write a HEREDOC block in my raku source instead of writing content like Air::Functional https://librasteve.github.io/Air/docs/Air/Functional.html, it renders as a text component on the site" ... however the use case I see for jupyter is "here is a .pynb file, please render it as an embedded block

[20:43] <disbot6> in an HTML page" - comment?

[21:02] <disbot6> <antononcube> The Jupyter framework knows how to export Jupyter notebooks to Markdown. I have low-priority TODO item to program Jupyter to Markdown converter in Raku, but I have found much need for it so far.

[21:03] <disbot6> <librasteve> well Air is about website, so Jupyter => HTML

[21:05] <disbot6> <antononcube> I see then, yes, "Jupyter::Grammar" has to be implemented, with actions to Markdown, HTML, Org-mode, Pod6, and Mathematica. 🙂

[21:06] <disbot6> <antononcube> As for the use case -- if I understand correctly -- of heredocs content being converted from Markdown to whatever (say, HTML) this can be done with the sub from-markdown for "Markdown::Grammar".

[21:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> BTW, "Markdown::Grammar" convert Markdown files to Jupyter. That was easy to do, that is why I think "Jupyter::Grammar" would be easy to do also.

[21:13] <disbot6> <antononcube> In case it is not clear/known -- a Jupyter notebook is "just" a JSON string. A JSON array of dictionaries (i.e. cells) with some conventions about the keys and values.

[21:14] <disbot6> <librasteve> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1446248207884746993/Screenshot_2025-12-04_at_21.13.49.png?ex=69334b1a&is=6931f99a&hm=c4c963424e822b4c032ef3f98826830d20b69cb5c0be6d5b3b01a8db72ab6f5d&

[21:15] <disbot6> <librasteve> ^^ this is the code that I just committed

[21:15] <disbot6> <librasteve> and how it is consumed (see raku.org/learn for the result)

[21:16] <disbot6> <librasteve> Air is just a nice way to write websites in raku

[21:16] <disbot6> <antononcube> I see -- great!

[21:18] <disbot6> <librasteve> my point is that, in general, you are not going to take the .ipynb json and paste into a main jupyter q::to/END/; stanza ... more likely you will want to just "include" the .ipynb file eg in resources

[21:19] <disbot6> <librasteve> no, not resources, but docs

[21:20] *** social joined
[21:21] <disbot6> <antononcube> Which -- the way I see it -- means that you have a sub from-jupyter(to => ...) that you can use however you see fit. Right?

[21:21] *** social left
[21:21] *** social joined
[21:22] <disbot6> <librasteve> hmm - need to think of a better name - docs is used elsewhere - the concept I have is "here is a root dir, walk it and render as a tree of html pages with optional nav and breadcrumbs - filetypes supported are md, pynb, pdf, html

[21:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> yes - pandoc/Markdown::Grammar/Jupyter::Grammar are all good engines

[21:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> would run once on first access

[21:24] *** social left
[21:24] <Voldenet> that sounds amazing, consider customizable rendering

[21:24] <disbot6> <antononcube> What is the of higher priority: (1) implementation of "Jupyter::Grammar", or (2) finishing the advent article for Dec 6th ?

[21:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> could point at a gh repo as the root

[21:24] <disbot6> <antononcube> (Unfair question, I know...)

[21:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh, mebbe rakudoc

[21:25] <disbot6> <librasteve> 222222222222222

[21:25] <Voldenet> e.g. `host-dir("/", :extensions(md => MarkdownRenderer.new, avi => FfmpegMp4, dwg => DwgToJpeg))` etc.

[21:25] <disbot6> <librasteve> .oO

[21:26] <Voldenet> with some sane default implementations, but also some customizability

[21:27] <Voldenet> having one .render method could also mean that the rendering pipeline can be composed a bit

[21:28] <Voldenet> so `(md => ComposeRendering.new(AddBreadcrumbs.new, AddHtmlStyling.new, MarkdownRenderer.new)`

[21:28] <disbot6> <librasteve> s/render/RENDER/

[21:29] <Voldenet> either would work, I'm unsure on whether binary files rendering should be supported or not

[21:29] <Voldenet> e.g. it'd be awesome to have font preview or autocad files work ootb

[21:29] <Voldenet> in browser

[21:29] <Voldenet> but that might even require rendering into multiple files

[21:29] <Voldenet> some of them binary

[21:31] <disbot6> <librasteve> https://github.com/librasteve/Air-Plugin-Hilite is one pattern, however, I think this deserves a different (more like a Cro transformer) pattern ... so maybe Air::Transformer::XXX

[21:31] <Voldenet> so `/car.dwg` becomes html, but has also `/car.dwg/areas.js /car.dwg/preview.jpg` and so on

[21:32] <Voldenet> though I'm just throwing the ideas out, wouldn't want to make it too bloaty

[21:35] <disbot6> <librasteve> Air::Plugin:: already has HTML, SCRIPT, CSS, SCSS as an interface - would need to add PREVIEW maybe THUMB

[21:36] <Voldenet> what I'm describing may as well be very out of scope, tbh.

[21:36] *** social joined
[21:36] *** social left
[21:37] <disbot6> <librasteve> the new thing would be "here's a root dir, propagate one child level to the parent nav"

[21:37] <Voldenet> attaching files could be done with something like `method RENDER { add-file("preview.jpg", :bytes(Buf…)); img :src("preview.jpg") }` OR `method RENDER { add-file("preview.jpg", :renderer(DwgToJpeg.new) }`

[21:38] <Voldenet> so RENDER would return html, but also hint that it has "subfiles"

[21:38] <disbot6> <librasteve> no, your thinking is a stretch - but 100% on message

[21:39] <Voldenet> also, there could be cases where buffering in-memory and range operator would be needed (FfmpegMp4 obviously, if you wanted to share proprietary digicam video for browsers)

[21:39] <Voldenet> erm, not buffering

[21:40] <disbot6> <librasteve> well - yeah - suggest we leave video streaming to v0.0.2

[21:40] <Voldenet> or where you really want to host symlink to /proc/meminfo :p

[21:40] <Voldenet> and want to have it in realtime

[21:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> I thinking now that "Jupyter::Grammar" is misleading, since no grammar is used or leveraged. So, maybe "Jypyter::Converters" is better, but I do not like much either.

[21:42] <Voldenet> I don't mean to implement dwg and mp4 conversion, just to make it possible via api somehow

[21:42] <disbot6> <librasteve> well, yes - a symlink to a streaming url (looks at wordpress youtube embed block)

[21:43] <Voldenet> but now that I can imagine rendering directory as gallery, media host (a'la youtube), wiki pages through only various top-level renderers, it's amazing

[21:46] <disbot6> <librasteve> yep!!

[23:49] <Voldenet> it says dosh in the title

[23:49] <disbot6> <antononcube> Yeah, found it.

[23:51] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hm... "LLM::DWIM" fails to install, when trying to install "dosh".

[23:54] <disbot6> <antononcube> Correction -- "LLM::DWIM" installs, "Test::META" installs, but I have to run them separately.

[23:54] <disbot6> <antononcube> After installing those, "dosh" installs too.

[23:57] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm, "dosh" might be Linux-tested and not that much on macOS...

[23:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> And yes, I like it -- it was in my TODO list try it out.

[23:59] <Voldenet> I did 'zef install dosh' and it all installed on the first attempt
