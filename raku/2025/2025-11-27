[11:00] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: sorry for the delay, I was thinking about that. So, my intention is to implement a higher level multi step migration system for Red. But it’s taking so long that I’m starting doubting I’ll implement that someday. I agree that migrations are very important to Red. So I think that having a lower level migration tool while the higher level isn’t implemented is a good thing and it could be the base from where the 

[11:00] <SmokeMachine> higher level one could be implemented. So, I would love to have it implemented! But it should use what Red already has.

[11:14] <disbot6> <holmdunc> As I understand it, the magic of Django's migrations is that it looks at one's Python model classes before and after, and generates the entire migration script automatically (not just a template / skeleton)?

[11:17] <SmokeMachine> holmdunc: that’s part of my intention with Red’s migration… I think my troubled link of thinking about that is better (but not well) explained here: https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15

[16:40] <guifa> o/

[16:44] * guifa has an idea for an Advent day post finally

[16:47] <guifa> We already have a URI module, but the object it produces can't be used in sets because it's mutable.  I think I could write a (mostly) succint article as yet another grammar tutorial, but add in talking about making things available for sets (and the design considerations that requires, with a comparison to the current URI module) + making it available as a generic token which I've talked about before in the past
