[21:11] <tbrowder> lizmat: will you be putting Data::Dump::Tree in community modules? i would like to submit a PR for it.

[21:13] <tbrowder> to try to make it work on macos

[22:13] <lucs> Given a declaration like  method baz (Int() $foo) , what do the parens after Int mean?

[22:13] *** habere-et-disper left
[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lucs: they specify that the argument should be coerced into the required type Int (if possible)

[22:19] <lucs> Ah, I see. Thanks.

[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Coercion

[22:21] <lucs> Interesting.

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub baz (Str $foo) {say $foo}; baz 12; baz 'two';

[22:23] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar 8835a4384: OUTPUT: ¬´(exit code 1) ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /tmp/pLaIPHsaST‚ê§Calling baz(Int) will never work with declared signature (Str $foo)‚ê§at /tmp/pLaIPHsaST:1‚ê§------> sub baz (Str $foo) {say $foo}; <HERE>baz 12; baz 'two';‚ê§¬ª

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling main.raku Calling baz(Int) will never work with declared signature (Str $foo) at main.raku:1 ------> sub baz (Str $foo) {say $foo}; ‚èèbaz 12; baz 'two'; 

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub baz (Str() $foo) {say $foo}; baz 12; baz 'two';

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  12 two 

[22:23] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar 8835a4384: OUTPUT: ¬´12‚ê§two‚ê§¬ª

[22:23] <lucs> So about those parentheses, in the third "multi method" shown at https://docs.raku.org/type/DateTime#method_new, are the absent parentheses after the Int for $minute simply a typo?

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> in the 2nd example, Int 12 is coerced to Str

[22:24] <lucs> Yep, gotcha.

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hmmm - dunno

[22:29] *** habere-et-disper joined
[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say  <5/2>.Int

[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  2 

[22:32] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar 8835a4384: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> For handling points in civil time, a DateTime object stores year, month, day, hour, minute (all Int), second (potentially fractional)

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so my guess is that the Signature line  Int() $hour, Int $minute, $second, is intended to disallow fractional $minute

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but above my understanding

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> That makes sense, but I was wondering why the coercion wasn't applied for only $minute.

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> its a good question - sorry I am just guessing

[22:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> must sleep

[22:37] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> In that case, sleep well üôÇ

[22:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> g'night
