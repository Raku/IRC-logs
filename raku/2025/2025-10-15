[12:04] <leont> Yeah that's what I dislike about Golang; it feels designed for teams where you don't actually trust your colleagues. Not saying they're necessarily wrong, but it's unfun.

[12:04] <disbot> <antononcube> Very interesting!

[12:17] <disbot> <simon_sibl> I just made a silly program to test between Rust and Go, they are both very similar, but Raku is just 👌  chef kiss, really wish I could just compile it and ship it the way Zig/Go allow compiling for many targets

[12:19] <disbot> <simon_sibl> I mean, it doesnt get much simpler/straightforward than this: https://glot.io/snippets/hc20ob7zd0

[13:59] <leont> simon_sibl: that does remind me though that Crypt::Argon2 is subtly broken and I need to get it fixed. It really really needs to take a Blob as its argument instead of a Str, otherwise encoding or normalization issues can cause false failures.

[14:05] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[14:05] <[Coke]> ah, File::Find broke in the latest version. 0.2.1 works on windows

[14:06] <SmokeMachine> arumiecrisps: depending what you want, `.cassify`

[14:07] <disbot9> <aruniecrisps> Does classify actually translate into a GROUP BY clause in SQL or does it work with resultsets?

[14:10] <SmokeMachine> example: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/nKTGp1Ew/image.png

[14:29] <tbrowder> [Coke]: i see File-Find 2.4.1 passing all OS on the github source

[14:31] <[Coke]> 2.4.1? Latest version is 0.2.4...

[14:32] <[Coke]> I opened a ticket on file find showing the error I'm seeing here on 0.2.4

[14:32] <[Coke]> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/File-Find/issues/50

[14:33] <[Coke]> At least for that, I can temporarily use 0.2.1 - META6 there are no working versions on windows that I can find right now

[14:33] <[Coke]> and that bug has been open since February. :(

[14:33] <[Coke]> and fixed in a PR since May

[14:34] <arkiuat> [Coke] you mean "zef search" ?

[14:34] <arkiuat> zef search File::Find # I think

[14:35] <[Coke]> arkiuat: that's better, thanks!

[14:35] <[Coke]> (I'm search for META6 now, but yes, thanks)

[14:37] <arkiuat> wow, that's a lot of versions of META6!

[14:39] <[Coke]> Many of them are not actual meta6 but contain a meta6

[14:39] <[Coke]> Ugh. doesn't look like there is any version that passes tests on windows with latest raku, though. :(

[14:40] <arkiuat> right, lots of fez in that listing

[14:43] <disbot9> <simon_sibl> I get random issue with the native library not being found sometimes, not sure why, I need to zef force install each time to fix this xD

[14:55] <disbot9> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine awesome thanks! I'll start playing around with it when I get home

[14:58] <ugexe> [Coke]: you can do `zef search "File::Find:auth<zef:raku-community-modules>"` which is pretty close. the only difference would be `zef search` does a prefix match on the name so something like File::Find::FooBar:auth<zef:raku-community-modules> would also show up

[15:56] <[Coke]> tbrowder: added a note to issue#50 - the test needs to fail gracefully if one cannot symlink

[15:56] <[Coke]> er, NOT fail - it needs to gracefully handle it

[16:01] <patrickb> cultoftheglenda: That's the source of the error. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/c9714bf939fb6114ce52f628b2cadb96d40c6b36/src/vm/moar/runner/main.c#L311

[17:22] <disbot9> <cultoftheglenda> the /proc filesystem is not properly mounted. I have an overlayfs and both the lower and upper filesystem had a /proc and it was causing the procfs mount to fail in workdir of the overlayfs.
