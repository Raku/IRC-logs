[02:31] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Isn't the lowercase int type from NativeCall for representing a platform-dependently-sized integer like C's int? I'm using it in a native routine signature and the compiler is complaining at me

[02:31] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> "The returning type of 'EVP_PKEY_encrypt' --> int is erroneous. You should not return a non NativeCall supported type (like Int inplace of int32), truncating errors can appear with different architectures"

[02:50] <japhb> .landyacht.: int is like a C int, it has platform- and compiler-dependent width.  You may want --> int32 or --> int64 instead

[02:55] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> well, the library also uses int rather than int32_t or whatever...

[23:01] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> hey guys, long time

[23:02] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> wanted to ask @tbrowder_04810 a question. what added functionality do you get using https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/Mi6::Helper over vanilla Mi6?

[23:02] *** apac left
[23:04] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> i'm thinking of using it for my next Raku package but i'm not entirely sure what extra benefits I get. Trying to weigh my options
