[07:45] <disbot1> <librasteve> erry: may i use this gist on the prototype raku.org new website?

[07:45] <erry> disbot1: I don't see why not

[07:45] <erry> Everyone needs to see cursed raku

[07:46] *** sourceable6 left
[07:46] *** sourceable6 joined
[07:46] <disbot1> <librasteve> also, guess if we have a pictogram version we need a cyrillic version also for balance â€¦ any volunteers

[07:46] <disbot1> <librasteve> tx!

[07:48] <disbot1> <librasteve> tbh i think raku can get more interest if it flaunts its powers for non latin code

[11:04] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: is it correct that the Deps module is not on raku.land ?

[11:04] <lizmat> and unknown to zef ?

[11:05] <SmokeMachine> yes, it is... it's not released yet... but I think I'll release it now, if it's of for entering on weekly...

[11:19] <tbrowder> hi, can anyone suggest a good example of using Cro to handle JSON url queries?

[11:29] *** librasteve left
[11:41] <tbrowder> never mind, just printed pages from cro website

[11:50] *** yewscion joined
[11:55] *** yewscion left
[12:03] <ab5tract> You will generally want to be sending JSON via post

[12:03] <ab5tract> Ie as a request body, not as a url query string

[15:32] <[Coke]> anyone know how to upgrade the git that comes with xcode so github stops yelling at me?

[15:32] <[Coke]> (no update available in app store(

[15:38] <[Coke]> ah. "neat, you don't". just install a newer version and use that instead. :)

[15:39] <[Coke]> (brew install git; hash -r)

[15:40] <[Coke]> whoops: Also, was azure devops, not github. :)

[23:15] <tonyo> if anyone wants to brave the next iteration of fez please PM me, i'm done with the testing and have the ecosystem migrated enough to run in hybrid mode.  you'll start getting instant feedback for uploads. this is probably not suitable for automated workflows yet because you may end up debugging a little bit or getting weird error messages

[23:16] <tonyo> i plan to run this way for another month at least and then you'll start getting deprecation messages on the upload endpoint (the upload will still work) for a few months, and then (finally) the legacy un-upgradeable endpoints will be turned off

[23:16] <tonyo> and i can save some $ :-)
