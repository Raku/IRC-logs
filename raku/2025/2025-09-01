[11:50] <Voldenet> if you mean these https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/lib/Local/Routes/Index.rakumod#L38

[11:51] <Voldenet> then maybe adding `select distinct on (name)` would reduce problems

[11:52] <Voldenet> and probably ordering by slug, because it's not unique (so it's deterministic)

[11:53] <Voldenet> erm, because it's unique, I mean
