[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> can Zulip bridge to IRC and Discord?

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i am a little worried that we lose intensity with each new venue

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> i'm not sure that "bridge everything" helps against scattered focus..?

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> actually, on second thought that might actually be one of few things that vaguely help.. hmm

[12:51] <tbrowder> lizmat: i just submitted another PR for Pod::TreeWalker. among other things, i discovered more pod in Dave's code to extract into a new Listener.md.

[12:55] <tbrowder> glad you're feeling better

[13:02] <tbrowder> i have discovered that with Pod::TreeWalker (and Pod::Load) i can pretty easily extract desired chunks of pod out of a document and tailor the end result as i wish. the trick is to walk known portions that are separated by blank lines and work on them. and jmerelo's Pod::Load allows one to extract pod from a string the user supplies. as my late brother would say "cool beans" indeed!
