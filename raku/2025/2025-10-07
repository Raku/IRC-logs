[11:34] <tbrowder> ref using "plan N" for tests. i do use it but normally not during development 'cause i typically design tests incrmentally. i mean to use "plan N" after all is settled and before release but have not done so lately. thnx for the reminder.

[14:53] <tbrowder> and @moritz always emphasized using plan is the proper way to test

[15:23] <lucs> I design, write, and run almost all the tests for my modules during development, and I can't be arsed to keep updating the count all the time, so no 'plan' for me.

[15:25] <lucs> Also, I use my Test::Selector for running my tests, I don't think that would work with a 'plan'.

[15:45] <arkiuat> lucs, but if you were to publish a module, wouldn't you want to release it with a fixed set of tests under plan?

[15:50] <arkiuat> ah, you're the author of Test::Selector, and I see in its /t dir you did no such thing

[17:26] <lucs_> Note that Test::Selector itself doesn't test itself with itself, eh, so I could add the 'plan' to it right now without too much annoyance since it's pretty stable.
