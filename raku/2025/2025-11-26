[01:30] <Voldenet> librasteve: tl;dr the explanation is what I initially thought and it's completely wrong :D

[01:30] <tellable6> Voldenet, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[01:30] <disbot6> <antononcube> About mod and % ?

[01:30] <Voldenet> yeah, I thought too that it was the remainder vs true modular arithmetics

[01:31] <Voldenet> but it's just nonsensical that for some values it behaves differently

[01:31] <Voldenet> but for some mod is the same as %

[01:32] <Voldenet> (I mean, -7 % 1.9 vs -7 mod 2.1)

[01:32] <Voldenet> erm, 7 % 1.9, 7 mod 1.9, etc

[01:32] <Voldenet> -7, even

[01:32] <disbot6> <antononcube> This reminds that I have put more tests in "Math::NumberTheory". Modular arithmetic is, of course, too central.

[01:34] <Voldenet> but I'm guessing that it's temporary

[01:36] <Voldenet> I see no reason for not using % (which, as one would expect, always returns the value in range `[0, divisor)`)

[01:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> I think this goes to the defintion of mod.

[01:42] <disbot6> <antononcube> Let me find an example and/or explanation.

[01:47] *** arkiuat left
[01:48] <Voldenet> no, it's not that

[01:48] <Voldenet> m: with -7.7 -> $a { .say for $a % 2.1, $a mod 2.1, $a % 1.9, $a mod 1.9 }

[01:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «0.7␤0.7␤1.8␤5.6␤»

[01:49] <Voldenet> 5.6 simply doesn't make sense

[01:50] <disbot6> <antononcube> Ok, and yes.

[01:51] *** arkiuat joined
[01:55] <disbot6> <antononcube> I think this is a explanation: -7 * 1.9 + 5.6.

[01:56] *** arkiuat left
[01:56] <disbot6> <antononcube> Now, -7 comes from div: -7.7 div 1.9 == -7.

[01:57] <disbot6> <antononcube> So, div and mod are consistent in this case.

[01:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> I think the expectation is -7.7 div 1.9 to give -5.

[02:00] <disbot6> <antononcube> It might be that div is the culprit.

[02:00] <Voldenet> yes

[02:00] <Voldenet> it is

[02:01] <Voldenet> I pasted yesterday this juicy line https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Real.rakumod#L144

[02:02] <disbot6> <antononcube> Cool1

[02:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> Damn, you "derailed" me! I have some Python programming to do. (Which I am payed for.)

[02:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> Not dealing with Raku numerics. (Which rarely someone is willing to pay for...)

[02:17] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> can zef install packages from cpan directly ? I wanted to download Spreadsheet::Read but it doesnt find it (even with --cpan flag) Also I guess it would then install that package in the Raku modules path and not in the Perl5 module path ?

[02:26] <Voldenet> if you mean perl5 packages, then probably you'd have to use cpanm or cpan

[07:37] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine @librasteve  I have an idea for Raku advent:   migrations for Red based on Ecto/Elixir

[07:39] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> The idea is that you would just write your migrations in Raku just like you would in Elixir  https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html

[07:41] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> At a rudimentary level this would be implemented with dynamic variables and blocks

[08:30] <disbot6> <librasteve> arun: that would be a big step to close the gap with Django… i definitely encourage this for an advent post

[08:31] <ab5tract> jnthn also wrote a migrations module, didn't he?

[08:32] <ab5tract> ISTR it from a presentation some years back

[08:34] <patrickb> ab5tract Did you notice my comment re NativeCall?

[08:36] <ab5tract> yeah, probably it means we won't have snow :/

[08:42] <ab5tract> considering I can't even get the libffi patch to compile: https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/31aceb75beb0cea71945f13bba208b75

[08:54] <ab5tract> .vushu: are you around by any chance?

[09:00] <disbot6> <librasteve> ab5tract: correct - its here https://raku.land/zef:jnthn/DB::Migration::Declare ...

[09:01] <disbot6> <librasteve> the README says... If one is using a Raku ORM such as Red, it is probably worth looking into how it might assist with migrations. This module is more aimed at those writing their queries in SQL, perhaps using something like Badger to have those SQL queries neatly wrapped up in Raku subs and thus avoid inline SQL.

[12:51] <lizmat> it just doesn't understand any bridged requests I think

[12:51] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[12:59] *** melezhik left
[13:32] <Voldenet> Oh, that's weird – it used to understand bridge requests before

[13:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> @rcmlz I think it is better to use dot than mm.

[13:44] <disbot6> <antononcube> Or, say, 'pdot' to hint parallelism.

[13:45] *** dg left
[13:49] <disbot6> <rcmlz> good point - the original idea was to promote >>OP<< but then - as usual - someone easily gets carried away and puts in 5 other nice features …

[13:50] *** dg joined
[13:52] <disbot6> <antononcube> @rcmlz My other comment / question is: how can you specify the :degree and :batch arguments in that infix operator?

[13:53] <disbot6> <antononcube> Is something like this possible:  @a dot(:3degree, :200batch) @b 

[13:55] <disbot6> <antononcube> Actually, for degrees 2 and 3  definitions of dot² and dot³ can be used.

[13:57] <disbot6> <antononcube> Obviously, a notation is fairly abused, but, still, it can be seen as a "neat example."

[13:58] <disbot6> <librasteve> for those following the % and mod saga, I made this https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/504

[14:00] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: yeah - you were right about ChatGPT hallucinations and the line in the Rakudo source - I just got a bee in moy bonnet to try and get to the bottom of it this morning

[16:45] <disbot6> <librasteve> lizmat: I am considering proposing a raku talk at one of the other devrooms at Fosdem and I noticed there is an SBOM devroom CfP (closes 30th November) https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2025q4/003702.html ... I will also mention this to Salve ... are you considering to propose a talk here that covers the recent raku SBOM modules?

[16:45] <disbot6> <librasteve> I will also mention the translation one to finanlyst via email https://translations-devroom.github.io/FOSDEMtranslationsDevroom26/

[16:48] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> SmokeMachine: I'm thinking having a simple DSL like that of Alembic, Ecto, and DB::Migrations::Declare for running up and down migrations is more than enough for most use cases. I'd love to get your thoughts on it
