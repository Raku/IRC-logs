[12:14] <tbrowder> hm, i don't see the difference between pick and roll explained any where in the docs...i guess i need to look at the Range class

[12:18] <tbrowder> erg, i was looking at the class...i don't remember exactly why i did the roll, but i think it was to a  more "random" pick to simulate the way the lottery girl picks them

[12:20] <tbrowder> not 5 at once, but i'm pretty sure mathematically the pick is the right way to do it.

[12:20] <tbrowder> draw without replacement

[18:17] <Voldenet> hm maybe docs should be more specific for these two

[18:20] <Voldenet> pick returns k-combination, roll returns k-combination with repetition

[18:20] <Voldenet> though I'm not sure if mathematical jargon would be helpful, it would be for me

[18:27] <disbot> <antononcube> "Sampling" and "sampling with replacement."

[18:30] <crnlskn> pulling from a bag with and without replacing!

[18:32] <Voldenet> hmmm, maybe "Pick random k elements from array" vs "Roll k times to get elements from array"

[18:32] <crnlskn> i do think the jargon has a place in the docs fwiw

[18:33] <crnlskn> programming is mathematical in too many ways to pretend it isn't

[18:34] <Voldenet> theoretically, but it's also human readable in too many ways

[18:34] <disbot> <antononcube> "Sampling" (for pick) and "sampling with replacement" (for roll) is the correct (popular) mathematical terminology.

[18:35] <Voldenet> statistical

[18:36] <Voldenet> nevermind that, naming needs to be practical

[18:37] <disbot> <antononcube> Whatever. The correct mathematical terminology have to be included.

[18:38] <crnlskn> those are "n-choose-k" and "n-multichoose-k" in combinatorics

[18:38] <Voldenet> Yeah, any form of it would be helpful, because it can be searched for

[18:38] <crnlskn> i think set theoretically we'd talk about subsets and multisets? not sure

[18:39] <disbot> <antononcube> No. In many cases the order in the sample matters.

[18:41] <Voldenet> there's also .classify vs .categorize – it might be difficult to guess what's the difference

[18:41] <crnlskn> fair, we'd talk about subsets and multisets iff `pick` and `roll` returned `Set`

[18:43] *** Sgeo joined
[18:43] <Voldenet> heh, so apparently there are many descriptions for .pick methods https://docs.raku.org/type/Setty#method_pick

[18:46] <Voldenet> it's a bit weird because they mostly do the same thing logically

[18:48] <Voldenet> I'd have no idea what this does from the description https://docs.raku.org/routine/pick#(role_Baggy)_method_pick

[19:05] <disbot> <librasteve> o/

[19:18] <coleman> librasteve: Can you handle the 404 in Cro?

[19:18] <disbot> <librasteve> oh - good idea ... please assign me the issue

[19:19] <disbot> <librasteve> (reads the Cro docs)

[19:43] <Geth> ¦ raku.org: librasteve self-assigned https://raku.org/community/irc link broken https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/252

[19:45] <Voldenet> I think you should be able to handle 404 by adding catch-all route to *

[19:50] <disbot> <jubilatious1_98524> test

[19:51] <disbot> <librasteve> lol - I just read the docs and realised that it was staring me in the face

[19:57] <Voldenet> I've figured out the syntax for 404 in cro:`   get -> Any { not-found 'text/plain', 'not found, sorry' }`

[20:01] <disbot> <librasteve> cool - I will use here https://github.com/Raku/infra/issues/105#issuecomment-3263979981 ... I would like to backport this as a general feature of Air too

[20:05] <Voldenet> >  after { content 'text/html', '<h1>Not found</h1>' if .status == 404 }

[20:05] <Voldenet> that works too

[20:08] <Voldenet> and it supports POST too

[21:05] <ugexe> there is no way to say "any greater minor version"

[21:06] <ugexe> unless you use api to represent the major version and version to just represent the minor version

[21:08] <ugexe> well let me rephrase that

[21:08] <ugexe> you can't do that using a string literal, which is what exists in e.g. META6.json

[21:10] <ugexe> in raku code you could say `:version(v2.1 .. v2.99999)` or some such, but the version supplied there isn't a string literal like :version<2.1 .. v2.9999> which is just looking for one specific verison "v2.1.v.2.9999"

[21:32] <disbot> <librasteve> ugexe: thanks for the feedback - would you be ok to make a PR to fix this?

[22:43] <tbrowder> ugexe: is "author" now the preferred term instead of "auth" for tags on distro names in META6.json and zef?

[22:43] <ugexe> author denotes who wrote it. "auth" is the authority. so no

[22:44] <tbrowder> ok, i get confused over the diff, thnx
