[11:13] <disbot6> <librasteve> hi everyone ... I am going in to the Advent posts site to schedule some of these for the first few days ... so far we have 8 posts to cover the 24 slots ... soooo if you are vaguely thinking about your own raku post, please do join in the fun! any level is welcome, beginner, intermediate or advanced.

[11:16] *** arkiuat joined
[11:20] *** arkiuat left
[11:26] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve I will finish my first post and put in the draft in WordPress within 3-5 hours.

[11:31] *** melezhik left

[11:39] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube - please can you upload a selection of your new Xmas images to the Wordpress media library, then authors can pick one if they like as the Post > Featured image?

[15:10] <moray> So, I'm trying putting together an advent post - I think I need a WordPress account or permission or something? I think I did one of these a long time ago, but can't remember if I had this or what I did?

[15:18] <disbot6> <antononcube> @moray Yeah, that is one way. Another is to put your post in GitHub (say, a gist) and then the “chief advent publisher” would publish it for you. (I think you have to make a PR on the advent repository that includes the link to your post.)

[15:19] <moray> Ok, that sounds good to me. Will give it a go. Thanks

[15:53] *** melezhik joined
[16:02] <disbot6> <antononcube> @moray Do you want / need / looking for any illustrations or images for your advent post?

[16:04] <moray> @antoncube I don't think so just going to be words and code I think...but don't mind if it's generically illustrated

[16:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm... can a certain UML diagram or flowchart fit in your post?

[16:09] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve I just uploaded some "snow images" in the WordPress Raku-Avent media.

[18:28] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube - excellent - thanks!

[18:30] <disbot6> <antononcube> I am “late” because I cannot convince the mind-map programs to properly include links and HTML tables in WordPress are too narrow.

[18:31] *** melezhik_ left
[18:34] <librasteve_> lizmat: hi! please can you give moray Wordpress Raku Advent author/editor permissions? (or upgrade me to a user admin)

[18:35] <librasteve_> moray: please can you go in to the Raku Advent Github repo and add your name and title to the next open slot … https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/raku-advent-2025/authors.md

[18:36] <moray> I'm creating a gist at the moment (I hope it will work out ok!). Is that going to be ok? I seem to remember wrestling with WordPress. Yes, I'll add my name.... (I can do WordPress if that's easier your end though - just if gist is just as easy for you)

[18:36] <librasteve_> moray: as mentioned, I am happy to take a github gist and make a Wordpress post about it … so you can take the route that works best for you

[18:41] <moray> Actually - I thought the gist might be transferrable to a WP post - if that's not the case, if you can get me access I'll write it up...
