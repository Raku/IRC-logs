[08:14] <ab5tract> have any other IRCCloud users discovered the glory of using it as a bounce server?

[08:15] <ab5tract> Halloy is a much prettier "head unit" than irccloud.com :) 

[08:18] <ab5tract> Voldenet: Nice code style! Did you end up doing any benchmarks?

[09:31] <disbot1> <rcmlz> I was reading https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency again. Another approach for your scheduler could be to not manage timing manually but "time the tasks" as they arrive (via Channel) like this: my $scheduled-task = Promise.in(calculated latest start).then( {task to do} ) and then put this same task on a "priority queue" channel. So before the workers start a task from the priority queue they chack if it alsready done, same

[09:31] <disbot1> any task started via .then() checks itself if it is already done.  That way all tasks get started at the scheduled time - and if there are idling workers they pull taks from the priority queue - any urgent tasks is thus priotirized over later-due-tasks.

[09:34] <disbot1> <rcmlz> And you do not need bussy wait ...

[09:35] <disbot1> <rcmlz> and manuall locking.

[13:23] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: what does bounce server mean? I’m curious…

[13:25] <SmokeMachine> Is it kinda proxy?

[13:26] <timo> "bouncer" is the term i know better

[13:26] <timo> it is very much like a proxy

[13:26] <timo> an irc client that runs on a machine that's (almost) always online, and then you can connect to it to do your ircing

[13:26] <timo> programs like psybnc

[13:27] <timo> usually the bouncer behaves as much as possible like an actual irc server, so it's transparent to clients that don't specifically support bouncers as a concept

[13:27] <ab5tract> Yeah it’s sort of like runnning Weechat or irssi in a mix

[13:27] <ab5tract> mix = tmux

[13:28] <timo> weechat also has a specific relay protocol so you can connect a weechat to a different weechat (or a client of that specific protocol, like glowing-bear)

[13:33] <SmokeMachine> I mostly use ircchat’s app, so Im probably not going to use a bouncer, and I really like IRCCloud’s app’s dark theme, much better then on the browser. Getting notifications when there is a message to me is great… :)

[13:38] <timo> as i understand it, irccloud already acts kind of like a bouncer by design

[13:53] *** arkiuat left
[13:53] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: yeah the irccloud client is more or less already connecting to irccloud as a "bouncer"

[13:53] <ab5tract> lots of pretty options here:https://themes.halloy.chat/

[16:48] * [Coke] having some fun today refactoring some raku for a small work project. (converting a bunch of utility methods into a class, then cleaning up the scripts/tests using those methods to make the class do most of the work)

[17:46] <ab5tract> Feels good to get paid to Raku, doesn’t it? :)

[17:46] <ab5tract> But even more so to see Raku delivering value, at least for me

[17:51] <ab5tract> Just yesterday a small aws Athena wrapper converted a few days of grunt work into a 2-3 hour background process

[17:55] *** melezhik_ joined
[17:57] <Voldenet> ab5tract: yes, the solution with hand-written iterator was the fastest (with the caveat that it has to be accessed sequentially to work), second was the allocating (via @n[(^$c).map({ 0..^$_, $_, $_^..^$c })]), .map(.map) was third and naive push/unshift was last  https://0x0.st/K_WT.perf

[17:58] <Voldenet> source: https://0x0.st/K_Wm.raku

[17:59] <Voldenet> ofc performance changes depending on length of initial array

[18:01] <Voldenet> i was pondering on whether I should post it, because it's misleading

[18:01] <Voldenet> benchmark tests fully consuming things

[18:02] <Voldenet> and assumes sequential access

[18:02] <lizmat> .oO( lies, damn lies and benchmarks )

[18:03] <Voldenet> if the lie is negated in a comment, it's true ;)

[18:04] <lizmat> and a bug becomes a feature  :-)
