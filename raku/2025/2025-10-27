[08:12] <disbot1> <librasteve> the base library has things like page and site so you need the incantation use Air::Functional :BASE; use Air::Base; to start

[08:28] <disbot1> <librasteve> ^^ this should work (this is an older pre Air::Base example code untested for a bit, but hopefully it'll be easy to get it to work) ... so arguably Air::Functional needs one small additional - a routine called err page (so have to be suppressed in :BASE) that goes sub page(HTML $html) is export { '<!doctype html>' ~ $html }

[08:30] <disbot1> <librasteve> I made an issue for it https://github.com/librasteve/Air/issues/38 ... feel free to make a PR (sorry I am a bit preoccuied with bits of Air on the workbench all around me atm)

[08:35] <wayland76> For those interested in the Raku keycaps I've been working on, I have a screenshot here: https://wayland.github.io/table-oriented-programming/RakuKeycapsScreenshot.png 

[08:37] <wayland76> Key -- Red = Set theory/Relational Algebra (including tables :p ).  Blue = the operators I want to use for trees.  Purple = matched brackets of various kinds, including the ones asked about (on 9/0).  Green = various others, some of which we use.  

[08:38] <wayland76> I'm still missing function composition, but hopefully I have the rest.  

[08:39] <wayland76> (not all of the relational algebra ones are implemented in Raku, but I'm hoping to get to them with table-oriented programming at some point, for the joins, etc)

[11:22] <disbot1> <librasteve> hi folks - does RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 engage the AST parser even if I go use 6.d? (or do I need to change to use 6.e.* to actually engage it)

[11:25] *** arkiuat joined
[11:29] <lizmat> RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 will engage the new grammar, for all language versions

[11:30] *** arkiuat left
[11:30] <disbot1> <librasteve> cool - works with Air ;-) ... mebbe I shoukd turn on all the time

[11:30] <lizmat> adding use 6.e.PREVIEW or use 6.* will only make the RakuAST:: classes visible (without needing to use "use experimental :rakuast")

[11:31] <disbot1> <librasteve> =b

[11:47] <wayland76> librasteve_: Well, these custom keycaps are looking to be $99 for the set.  I'm thinking I get a second keyboard just for typing these.  Oh, I also forgot to mention -- the Greek keyboard layout is the standard Greek layout from xkb, which will make it easier for me to design a layout

[11:48] <wayland76> But the plan is definitely that I have this as a second keyboard, and only reach across to it when I need it.  Anything I use regularly I'll incorporate into my regular setup.  

[11:51] <wayland76> Their two-tone keys are interesting, but I'm not sure I want to do that for now.  

[11:52] <disbot1> <librasteve> since I use Intellij+RIP, I have installed the Spec & Math Symbols plugin go I get autocomplete is I start typing eg symbol...union

[11:53] <wayland76> Interesting!  I'd rather not be tied to one editor :)

[11:55] <disbot1> <librasteve> just found Greek Symbol plugin also --- well these are pretty generic issues, so I guess that eg vi has code completion plugin has symbol lib (or you dould write it)

[11:55] <disbot1> <librasteve> etc

[14:09] <ds7832> regarding keyboards: personally I find the special key layers of the Neo2 layout extremely convenient for Raku. Neo2 is optimized for German, but there's also a QWERTZ and (on Linux) a QWERTY version available, which gives one the special key layers without the need to adapt to different letter positions. Chart available here, at the bottom (see esp. layers 3 and 6): https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/neoqwertz/

[14:17] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @wayland76 I've often wondered why--over the years--no one has seemed to come up with a Perl keyboard layout. Something like Vi/Vim but with option-HJKL mapped to $ @ % &

[14:18] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Here's a related Github-repo for "Perl6": https://github.com/donaldh/Perl6-macOS-keyboard

[14:21] *** arkiuat left
[14:22] * timo is also a big fan of neo2

[14:24] <ds7832> jubilatious1_98524: good point with the $ @ % & (and I would add #).

[14:27] <ds7832> I've just added some remappings to my helix config to make $ @ % easier to type there. Shift-1 is now %, Shift-2 is now $, and Shift-3 is now @. (The default symbols on those keys (° § ℓ) are barely ever needed when programming.)

[14:57] <Voldenet> I'm a fan of en-US layout everywhere, because a lot of special characters are usable without Shift even

[14:57] *** oodani left
[14:58] <Voldenet> though () are a lot more useful than [] and they do require that additional combo, which is unusual

[14:59] <Voldenet> {} are more useful too, I wonder why square brackets were preferred

[15:00] <Voldenet> because I can't imagine [] being used more than () in regular text either

[15:00] *** oodani joined
[15:04] <Voldenet> in Poland hardly anyone uses polish layout anymore, it used to be default in windows 20 years ago, but everyone used US keycaps, so defaults were changed quickly

[18:59] <disbot1> <cokebot9000> Yah, in discord, it looks like a space and a LEFT CURLY BRACKET - but you can highlight it and you'll see it's one character. on my irc font it's clearly a different character.

[19:14] <timo> you could use q with an opening regular curly and then put a fullwidth closing curly somewhere to make someone think that the string literal ends where it doesn't actually, or to have { } inside a qq string that are or are not actually code

[19:17] <Voldenet> there are use cases for it, but I stand away from unicode that looks like ascii

[19:19] <[Coke]> if that's the greek one, yes, it's part of the encoding.

[19:19] <[Coke]> so by the time the code sees it, it's already a semicolon

[19:20] <Voldenet> it'd be enormously shaky contraption though

[19:28] <[Coke]> guessing this is in MVM_string_chr - turn codepoint to string

[19:32] <Voldenet> hm… so if you try to to use grammars to parse binary string (I remember seeing such code in bencode), 0x037E would get turned into 0x003B

[19:34] <[Coke]> m: "\c[GREEK QUESTION MARK]".uninames

[19:35] <[Coke]> is it binary or is it string?

[19:35] <[Coke]> if string, yes.

[19:35] <[Coke]> Raku has Blobs and Bufs, not binstrings.

[19:35] <[Coke]> m: "\c[GREEK QUESTION MARK]".uninames.say

[19:36] <[Coke]> did we lose camelia?

[19:36] <Voldenet> but you probably can't use grammars on Buf/Blob

[19:37] <[Coke]> (that prints (SEMICOLON), FYI)

[19:37] <timo> indeed, though you can do the terrible hack of just stringifying the buf to hexadecimals separated by spaces (so you don't accidentally match the upper and lower nybble of two adjacent bytes)

[20:18] <dmaestro> I've been using the reduce function with a two-argument code block, and a single (init) value followed by a possibly empty list ($init, |@list) - this used to work with an empty list, but now, after upgrading to rakudo-star 2025.5 and later, does not. The documentation suggests a single value list should be accepted and return the value directly.

[20:18] <dmaestro> This works with built-in operators. Why did it stop working with user-supplied code blocks or functions?

[20:27] <dmaestro> Also, if someone could remind me how to run a code snippet here, it would be appreciated! :b

[20:27] <Voldenet> show code example so maybe bisect bot will reveal something

[20:28] <dmaestro> Yes, I haven't been on IRC in ages, how do I quote or run code snippets?

[20:31] <lizmat> dmaestro: the whatevercode block * * * expects 2 arguments

[20:31] <lizmat> you're providing only one

[20:31] <lizmat> bisectable6: old=2024.01 say reduce (* * *), 10

[20:31] <bisectable6> lizmat, Bisecting by exit code (old=2024.01 new=7117060). Old exit code: 0

[20:33] <lizmat> the infix:<*> sub has special cases for 0 and 1 arg calls

[20:33] <lizmat> * * *    does not

[20:34] <dmaestro> Right, so the "magic" that used to work for a single argument call no longer does?

[20:35] <lizmat> yes, because there is no way that you can reliably guess what the correct behaviour is for user supplied Callables in that case

[20:36] <bisectable6> lizmat, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/894612d43e8e9ffc6fde6e7f292e5dc3

[20:36] <bisectable6> lizmat, There are 40 candidates for the first “new” revision. See the log for more details

[20:36] <lizmat> if the documentation still suggest that a single value list should produce the single value, then that feels like a doc issue

[20:36] <dmaestro> Sounds reasonable, just broke my code (which used to be pretty intuitive). Are there any simpler options (allowing inline Callable?) than creating a multi sub?

[20:36] <lizmat> -> $a = 0, $b = 1 { $a * $b }

[20:37] <dmaestro> Excellent! Thanks.

[20:38] <lizmat> -> $a, $b? { $b.defined ?? $a * $b !! $a }

[20:38] <lizmat> in case you just want to handle the 1 arg case

[22:24] <arkiuat> so the zef troubles I was complaining about recently were my own fault: I had stupidly left RAKULIB set to . somewhere. ugexe has explained to me how this breaks stuff

[22:46] * ds7832 wonders if that's also the reason for issues he's been having with zef not finding dependencies it previously installed

[22:57] *** arkiuat left
[22:59] *** arkiuat joined
[23:01] <arkiuat> ds7832, it certainly could be

[23:03] <ugexe> unlikely

[23:03] <ugexe> that is almost certainly an issue with their environment / rakudos, which one is being used to invoke zef (and which rakudo zef would install those modules to), and which rakudo actually gets run when invoking raku directly

[23:04] <ugexe> if zef doesnt find dependencies that were previous installed than your method of determining if they are installed is flawed (see previous comment) or you uninstalled them / nuked the repo

[23:04] <ugexe> s/than/then/

[23:06] <ds7832> I should mention this is on a NixOS machine, which I don't really understand yet. My Rakudo build being compiled from source.

[23:06] <ds7832> (the environment vars are indeed not set, though)

[23:09] <ugexe> why do you think it isn't finding dependencies it previously installed?

[23:12] <ds7832> iirc, during the installation of some modules with many dependencies, zef would say it's installing the dependencies and report success of that, but then in the next step say it couldn't find that very module. I'm seeing now if I can reproduce this to give a log

[23:13] <ugexe> it helps to be precise here... when you say during install do you mean during staging? installation is the last phase of `zef install .` which occurs after testing

[23:13] <ugexe> staging happens before testing

[23:14] <ugexe> also, are you sure it isn't zef that is finding it and not rakudo failing to find it when e.g. loading it for a test?

[23:14] <ugexe> but yeah a log will be useful

[23:16] *** LainIwakura left
[23:18] *** sftp joined
[23:18] *** sftp left
[23:18] *** sftp joined
[23:20] <ds7832> this is a log illustrating it: https://pastebin.com/hZiF0DWX  So a bit different from what I wrote above

[23:21] <ds7832> yes, could really be the error is coming from Rakudo trying to load it

[23:33] <ds7832> and it's definitely before the actual installation, apparently during staging.

[23:38] <ugexe> what happens when you run `raku -e 'use File::Temp;'

[23:42] <ds7832> goes through without error

[23:42] <ugexe> well, it is installed then. and the error you shown was indeed during staging, which is when raku precompiles it so it is a precompilation issue

[23:43] <ugexe> not sure why that would happen though. the only thing i can guess would be because you are using rakudo star, and File::Temp is part of rakudo star, and somehow those things are causing this

[23:46] <ugexe> if you wanted to experiment you could try `zef uninstall File::Temp` to get rid of whatever raku star installed, and then try to install again

[23:46] <ds7832> Ah! I think I remember suspecting that too at some point

[23:46] <ds7832> and force installs of the precise "missing" module always resolved that issue

[23:47] <ds7832> so doing that one by one, I eventually succeeded in installing e.g. Cro :)

[23:48] *** guifa joined
[23:49] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> i'm wondering if there was a way to auto add files to the provides field in META6.json

[23:49] <ds7832> the problematic modules were always very "standard" ones, so I would suspect them to be ones included in Star.
