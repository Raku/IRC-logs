[06:44] <cmburn> How would I get the containing package of an object in Raku?

[07:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i would vote for fewer discord channels - maybe archive the ones that are inactive to help newcomers feel less tumbleweedy

[07:27] <tellable6> hey librasteve, you have a message: https://gist.github.com/a8e7b45800a631d1a6eb22e899a91be3

[07:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cmburn: $?PACKAGE

[09:30] <tellable6> 2025-05-07T23:20:21Z #raku <coranila> wayland76: make test or make spectest, depending on whether it's a Rakudo test or a Raku test

[09:30] <tellable6> 2025-05-07T23:21:00Z #raku <coranila> wayland76: alternatively make $repative_file_path runs only one test file

[09:31] <wayland76> .tell coranila Thanks!  

[09:31] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to coranila

[15:55] <[Coke]> crag suggestion: maybe allow multiple args to be allowes, so I can do "crag 2+3, 4+5" and not "crag '2+3, 4+5'"

[15:59] <[Coke]> (basically $arg = @args.join(' '))

[16:00] <[Coke]> how to, say, convert ºC to f?

[16:01] <lizmat> re crag: librasteve what would be against turning it into a REPL like app ?

[16:05] <[Coke]> I for one don't want a repl-only version

[16:06] <[Coke]> if it could still be invoked as a command line, nifty

[16:14] <[Coke]> (but that's just my 2¢)

[16:14] <[Coke]> also: a way to process command line args would be nice?

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [Coke]: all suggestions gratefully received ... the idea of crag (well 3sec unless you have an M4 Max) is to just quickly get an answer to some point question, so I think that a list of calcs is a bit err quirky

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-App-Crag/blob/main/crag-of-the-day.md has a bunch of examples

[16:40] *** Awonder joined
[16:43] *** dakkar left
[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also crag is just a wrapper on https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Measure ...

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> atm the optimal way to do that is crag '^<39 °C> .in: <°F>' 

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> which is another way to spell crag '♎️<39 °C> .in: <°F>'

[16:50] <[Coke]> FYI, the second to last one you sent dies here with "couldn't parse defn Str ºC"

[16:50] <[Coke]> ... and it looks like your degree char might not be the same.

[16:50] <[Coke]> m: say "°".uninames

[16:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb0857c8b: OUTPUT: «(DEGREE SIGN)␤»

[16:50] <[Coke]> m: say "º".uninames

[16:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb0857c8b: OUTPUT: «(MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR)␤»

[16:51] *** Guest74 left
[16:51] <[Coke]> Lovely - that's what I get when I type "option 0" on a mac, which *looks* like degrees but isn't.

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> you are probably using º instead of °

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - actually I consider that a bug and that Physics::Unit should take both

[16:53] <[Coke]> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Unit/issues ?

[16:53] <[Coke]> I can add a request there.

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> im doing it now

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Unit/issues/26

[16:53] <[Coke]> oh, https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Physics-Unit/issues/26

[16:54] <[Coke]> ah, that's why it showed up on a second search. :)

[16:54] <[Coke]> Thanks

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the REPL, yes I am pretty keen to add a REPL mode to crag (ie if you type bare crag) using lizmats awewons REPLy stuff ... probably quite trivial to do

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yw

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag is a way for me to road test ^<<number><.ws><unit-str><.ws><error>?> as a better ♎️<<number><.ws><unit-str><.ws><error>?> ...

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^<39 ºC> feels good to me - better than eg u|39 ºC| --- but I am very open to feedback and ideas on that

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> crag '(^<39 °C> .in: <°F>) .in: <°C>' => 39ºC (love those Rats)

[17:07] *** human-blip left

[23:00] <wayland76> Question: With "zef install ." (note the dot), it will install all dependencies, and then the thing in '.'.  Is there a way to get it to install the dependencies, but not the thing in '.' itself?

[23:24] *** lichtkind left
[23:40] <japhb> .tell wayland76 The --depends option, I believe

[23:40] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to wayland76

[23:58] <[Coke]> .tell wayland76 zef install --deps-only .

[23:58] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to wayland76

[23:58] <[Coke]> I do this all the time for raku/doc

[23:58] <[Coke]> I also make much more use of --serial than I should (install everything you can even if something in the chain fails)
