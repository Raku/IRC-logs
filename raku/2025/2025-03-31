[11:17] *** derpydoo left
[11:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> 4 days ago I raised an issue on DBIish community modukes https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish/issues/242

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I also proposed a (rough and ready) PR to bypass the test issue (move test 43... to /xt) since I do not have the DB chops to go in a fix that properly.

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (obviously) I am reluctant to just accept my own PR (I seem to have the rights) since this is generally bad practice ... perhaps someone can go in and review ...?

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Smokemachine: I have closed the issue on Red - tested fine with 2025.02

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (given that you zef install DBIish without test 43 first)

[11:29] <lizmat> librasteve in a community strapped for contributors, I think it's ok to merge one's own PR's as long as nobody had any (negative) comments

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> will do

[11:30] <lizmat> forgiveness vs permission etc etc etc  :-)

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> don

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> e

[11:31] <lizmat> could you then also do a release ?

[11:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hmmm - gonna need fez community login I guess

[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please can someone PM me the fez creds

[11:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (if that be the way)

[11:38] <lizmat> librasteve you're already part of the "raku-community-modules" fez group

[11:39] <lizmat> you can use your own credentials to upload a release of a raku community module

[11:39] <lizmat> the same you use to upload using your own zef:librasteve auth

[11:39] <lizmat> *for

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok

[11:44] <lizmat> mi6 release

[11:44] <lizmat> should do the trick for ya

[11:44] *** Tirifto left
[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sadly my strategy failed since mi6 release does /xt tests ... lemme fix my PR a better way and try again (may take a day or two)

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> I dropped some example on how to use Raku/Sparrow instead of sed if someone is interested - https://stackoverflow.com/a/79546627/5147708

[15:43] *** lichtkind_ joined
[15:44] <lichtkind_> can someone please remind me what is the holiday raku 6.e will be named after? thank you

[15:49] <grondilu> I've completely rewrote my Chess module.  Lots of classes, enums, subset... basically trying to put a type on everything.  Also aiming at immutability for classes, contrary to the original chess.js code.

[15:49] *** lichtkind_ left
[15:50] <grondilu> Very acceptable loss of performance.  37s for perft(4) before, 1m17s now.

[15:52] <grondilu> I think this could be a neat performance test for raku overall.

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> And this one - https://stackoverflow.com/a/79546689/5147708

[16:00] <lizmat> grondilu: have you considered uploading Chess to the zef ecosystem ?

[16:03] <grondilu> isn't it there already?

[16:03] <lizmat> no, it's still on the old github ecosystem

[16:03] <lizmat> and that's being deprecated

[16:03] <grondilu> I see

[16:03] <grondilu> I have to read the zef doc, but I will

[16:04] <lizmat> I could make a PR for you if you want ?

[16:04] <grondilu> sure

[16:04] <grondilu> thanks

[16:05] <lizmat> meh, I can't check out the repo on my case-insensitive file system  :-(

[16:05] <lizmat>   'images/K.png'

[16:05] <lizmat>   'images/k.png'

[16:06] *** yewscion joined
[16:07] <[Coke]> 6.e had a bunch of suggestions but I don't think a holiday has been chosen yet.

[16:07] *** apac left
[16:07] <grondilu> how can you even work with a case-insensitive fs?

[16:07] <[Coke]> lizmat: I have a special volume on my mac devoted to such things.

[16:07] <[Coke]> grondilu: it JFW > 95% of the time

[16:08] <[Coke]> also is a canary for default FS on windows

[16:09] <grondilu> btw I'm a bit concerned about my repo depending on local files such as images.  Will these images still be accessible after install?

[16:10] <grondilu> because otherwise I could turn them into blobs in a module.

[16:10] <lizmat> or put them in resources ?

[16:10] <[Coke]> grondilu: there is a way to install resource files. No need to store them in code or somesuch

[16:10] *** yewscion left
[16:11] <[Coke]> and then you can refer to them the same way if you're running with 'raku -I.' or an installed version.

[16:11] <grondilu> I see.  Is it related to that : https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#%?RESOURCES ?

[16:11] <lizmat> yup

[16:12] <grondilu> ok, will do.

[16:12] <[Coke]> grondilu++

[16:12] <grondilu> should I rename my pieces images filenames to all lower case?

[16:13] <grondilu> or can I keep considering case-insensitve file systems are oddities?

[16:14] <[Coke]> your module, your choice, but in general, they are not oddities. it's the default on mac and windows.

[16:17] <grondilu> even Windows?  I'm surprised.

[16:19] <[Coke]> Pretty sure that's always been the default on windows.

[16:19] <lizmat> well, I think MS-DOS would just uppercase everything, in my recollection

[16:20] <lizmat> MacOS doesn't: it's case preserving, case insensitive  :-)

[17:04] <ugexe> steam famously doesn't work on macos with a case sensitive file system, so a lot of people won't/can't enable the case sensitive file system if it is more sane

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu It might be a good idea to have the data for "Chess" (images, games, etc.) in a separate package. (Since you are doing refactoring anyway...)

[18:18] <grondilu> not sure what you mean.  The data is in the files.

[18:19] <grondilu> I do have a Chess::Graphics package, though.

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> And this one - https://stackoverflow.com/a/79546986/5147708

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Probably I need to add all the references to the next weekly

[18:24] <lizmat> make a blog post  :-)

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @grondilu I am saying to have a separate with the chess data (which is in the files.) This way, for example, installation problems would be easier to figure out. That might be hard or not possible for you package, though.

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> This blog post is going to be just a collection of stack overflow links then )

[18:44] <lizmat> is it so hard to add a little text as to why you added a link ?

[18:48] *** notna joined
[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Should not be hard -- use an LLM for relevant narration interleaved with the links.

[18:53] *** notna left
[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> lizmat: this is doable I guess , thanks for suggestion

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Antononcube : how can I generate LLM based narration for these links ?

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> https://stackoverflow.com/a/79547064/5147708

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Actually here is a main link - https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Raku%2FSparrow

[19:53] <grondilu> does zef handle git's submodules well?  I'm considering adding one for my Chess module. Namely https://github.com/lichess-org/chess-openings.git

[19:55] <[Coke]> what does zef have to do with submodules?

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> grondilu: I would suggest you make a thin raku shim moduke on the git submodule and then add that as a dep in your META6.json

[19:55] *** yewscion joined
[19:56] <[Coke]> are you uploading the distro to fez?

[19:56] <grondilu> I mean my understanding is that when cloning the repo, it would also have to do the `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` otherwise it won't see the files.

[19:56] <[Coke]> you're thinking of the old ecosystem list of modules where things were installed from git - don't use that.

[19:56] <grondilu> oh

[19:57] <grondilu> it's not using git at all?

[19:57] <[Coke]> not with the fez ecosystem.

[19:57] <[Coke]> (or cpan)

[19:57] <grondilu> noted

[19:58] <ugexe> even if you pass zef a git url ala `zef install https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git` it will not clone submodules as distributions do not get to determine where a distribution is sourced from

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @melezhik I will make a gist or similar later today.

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe with Inline::Python in this case
