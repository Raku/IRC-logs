[09:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> o/ hi!

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my regex brain is fading ... I have this rx / <[A..Za..z]> && <[0..9]> / to check that a str has at least one digit and one letter... but it fails I guess since the conjunction && requires a substring to match BOTH the first and second criteria ... can anyone show me how to do this within a regex?

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> hi, i think doing this within a regex involves lookaheads/behinds etc. and gets tedious if not worse in performance

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> compared to doing two regexes and &&'ing their results

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> @librasteve: regex are linear unless you introduce lookaround or backreferences; as such you probaby want "a letter followed by a number or a number followed by a letter",  as in /[ <[A..za..z]> .* <[0..9]> ] || [<[0..9]> .* <{A..Za..z]>/ or /<alpha><?before <digit>>||<digit><?before <alpha>>/

[09:42] <lizmat> m: say so"fo1".contains(/ <[A..Za..z]> / & / <[0..9]> /)

[09:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[09:42] <lizmat> I think that actually reads better as well

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> yes but that's the "cheat" of using two regexes - which i do agree is probably appropriate, but still is a bit of cheat in that it does reframe the problem somewhat - of course, in the interest of clarity this is totally approppriate here!

[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> .oO( too many words for "i agree" :-) )

[10:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks to all‚Ä¶ it certainly reads better ‚Ä¶ this is the test for a Cro::WebApp::Form is validated trait, so hopefully I can jam multiple regex into the API

[11:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the api takes the thing and applies as the rhs of a ~~ smartmatch will report back later when back in the keys

[11:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> feels a junction coming on

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: that works well...

[14:37] <timo> if you want a && to ensure both a letter and a digit, you can most easily .* before and after it I think

[14:43] <timo> m: for <abc 987 ab1cd2ef abcd1 1abcd 11a33> { say $_, " matched? ", so m/ .* <[a..z A..Z]> .* && .* <[0..9]> / }

[14:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: OUTPUT: ¬´abc matched? False‚ê§987 matched? False‚ê§ab1cd2ef matched? True‚ê§abcd1 matched? True‚ê§1abcd matched? False‚ê§11a33 matched? True‚ê§¬ª

[15:43] <Guest35> what is the keyword that says stop scanning the source code?

[15:46] <jdv> exit?

[15:46] <lizmat> =finish

[15:49] <jdv> hmm, is there something like __DATA__ in raku?

[15:49] <jdv> i feel like i used to know this

[15:49] <lizmat> $=finish

[15:50] <lizmat> everything after =finish

[15:50] <jdv> but is that a fh?

[15:50] <jdv> or stream or whatever

[15:50] <lizmat> it's a string

[15:50] <lizmat> m: say $=finish.^name

[15:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: OUTPUT: ¬´Mu‚ê§¬ª

[15:50] <lizmat> meh

[15:51] <lizmat> m: say $=finish‚ê§=finish‚ê§foo

[15:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[15:51] <lizmat> m: say $=finish.^name‚ê§=finish‚ê§foo

[20:13] <tbrowder> my wife‚Äôs macbook wants to upgrade from Sonoma to Sequoia, any reason not to?

[20:13] <tellable6> 2025-04-24T23:02:54Z #raku <wayland> tbrowder: This is why I've wrapped my github tests in a docker container, so that I can run the container on local when debugging these problems.  

[20:17] <tbrowder> wayland: sounds like a good idea, but i just tried reading github‚Äôs logs again and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. i think when the test‚Äôs do fail, their short msg seems not to be very helpful.

[20:19] <tbrowder> re macbook, only 8 GB ram, is that enough for the upgrade?
