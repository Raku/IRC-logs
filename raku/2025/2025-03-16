[01:23] <ugexe> there is no compiling executable on any OS with raku. the best you can do is have an msi installer for your app on windows which also installs raku. see https://github.com/raku-community-modules/App-InstallerMaker-WiX

[09:51] <Xliff> So best way to get indexes of a bit string from a Buf: grep?

[09:52] <Xliff> https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gcr/gcr-3/index.html

[09:54] <patrickb> If a mono file isn't necessary, I'd just use one of the pre compiled release zips from rakudo.org, install stuff as necessary and zip it up again.

[09:55] <Xliff> lizmat: Um.... .grep(<num>, :k) seems to be better than P5pack

[09:56] <Xliff> With a bit of fiddling, I can get what I want.
