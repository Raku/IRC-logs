[11:35] <lizmat> weekly: https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/470

[11:35] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[11:40] *** wbooze_ is now known as Inline

[11:44] <Voldenet> IMO `$foo.=bar.baz` should be interpreted as `$foo = $foo.bar.baz`

[11:44] <lizmat> yeah, the DWIM option  :-)

[11:47] <Voldenet> in fact, method calling ops are problematic in even more cases

[11:47] <Voldenet> m: sub x { $^a.say }; 42.&x

[11:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 490a23b0c: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[11:47] <Voldenet> m: sub x { $^a.say }; 42 .&x

[11:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 490a23b0c: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed postfix call (only basic method calls that exclusively use a dot can be detached)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> sub x { $^a.say }; 42 .<HERE>&x␤»

[11:48] <lizmat> that's a different issue, please let not mix them  :-)

[11:49] <Voldenet> I know, just wanted to see if that edge case still exist

[11:49] <lizmat> well, apparently that error has been made specifically for that case.  I wonder why

[11:50] <Voldenet> though to me the solution of both cases could be on ast side

[11:51] <lizmat> in the $foo .= bar.baz case, for sure

[11:52] <Voldenet> what I mean is that they could rewrite the code in specific way

[11:52] <lizmat> the .&x case, for some reason someone put a stop to that for a specific reason

[11:52] <lizmat> yeah, gotcha  :-)

[11:52] <Voldenet> so `(a).&b` becomes `b(a)`

[11:54] <lizmat> again, @Larry at some point decided to not allow detached .&foo     we need to figure out first why that was

[11:57] <Voldenet> maybe & could be used in some other context… junction?

[11:58] <lizmat> possibly

[11:58] *** Inline left
[11:59] *** Guest236 joined
[12:02] <Voldenet> it could be fairly useful with new .assuming, but the syntax wouldn't be very appealing

[12:02] <Voldenet> m: sub x { ($^a, $^b).say }; 42.&(&x.assuming(1, *))

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 490a23b0c: OUTPUT: «(1 42)␤»

[12:03] *** JimmyZhuo joined
[12:06] <Voldenet> intriguingly, feed op does very similar thing

[12:07] <Voldenet> m: sub x { ($^a, $^b).say }; 42       ==>          x(1) # but it allows space

[12:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 490a23b0c: OUTPUT: «(1 42)␤»

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @holyghost CommaIDE is not maintained anymore. I assume some people have kept its old versions.

[12:19] <Voldenet> hah

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe the Comma Plugin (2.0) can work on both old and new computers with "current" IntelliJ.

[12:19] <Voldenet> m: sub x { ($^a).say }; ($=42)    .=    &x;

[12:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 490a23b0c: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[12:19] <Voldenet> so it is allowed, just in a very roundabout way

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, "Comma plugin" same as "Raku plugin".

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezhik: I am planning to put your sparky badge in my readme - do you support the mi6 Badge shortcut (see dist.ini)

[14:36] <melezhik> yeah I mean that maybe it'll be interesting to use Sparrow check dsl to test HTML output like this - https://github.com/melezhik/Air-Sandbox/blob/main/tasks/air-readme/task.check

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Showing your MI6 badge in public might be contrary to agency's policy.

[14:40] <melezhik> to support sparky badges I'll need probably create a PR for App::Mi6 , not sure though if sparky is popular enough for such a PR, meanwhile you can pick up the badge code from report page

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the default mi6 operation is to overwrite README.md from MyModule.rakumod rakudoc ... right now I have this disabled so its no problem, but without this Mi6 PR I cannot enable it (which would be nice) ... the benefit to you is that if you put sparky setup in Mi6 then more people will be likely to use sparky

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ![SparrowCI](https://ci.sparrowhub.io/project/librasteve-Air/badge)

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ i put this in my README and doesnt work (just shows "Sparky: Build")

[14:58] *** yewscion joined
[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry I saw the sparky docs say my $badge = "![Sparky](https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/badge/{tags()<SPARKY_PROJECT>}?foo=bar)"; but I cannot see where to pick up the badge or what tags() or foo bar are

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also the build is failing on sparky (it passes on my locak machine ) - so that is a bit of an issue too

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well mi6 was failing too (gha) - just fixed that so taking another look at sparky web status

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezik: maybe you can send me login creds via pm (or to librasteve@furnival.net) then I can start a sparky build and hopefully see the logs?

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> librasteve: Air project is already on Sparky.  The badge could loaded from this link - https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/file_view/librasteve-Air/yamxvpshgdfuqojcwitl2478905/badge.txt

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> For convenience every report has artifacts tab

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Where one can pick up badge.txt with badge markdown code in it

[15:38] *** yewscion joined
[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> OK - I have the badge, it now shows Failing as expected

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks!

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> it now is riunning 2025-03-14 15:41:22 on sparky webpage

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and now it shows Failed on the sparky webpage ... BUT it succeeds locally and with the Mi6 GHA ... so how can I debug the sparky fail?

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> You need to go to sparky and look at the last report

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/report/librasteve-Air/23999

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Could not find Cro::HTTP::Router

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Actually

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - you have to click the number to go to the report ... tbh that was hard to find without you showing me

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yeah . Sorry . I am aware about this UX flaw

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have now added Cro::HTTP::Router META6.json deps (red fac)

[15:49] *** jpn joined
[15:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> job number 24000 that must be lucky

[15:49] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yep 👍

[15:50] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Nice number by the way 😀

[15:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that's what I mean

[15:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh just found the official badge under Artifacts

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yes

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Cro deps by the way always take time to install even with -/test zef flag

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah I'm watching the paint dry

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> So now build will be way more slower

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Also sparky vm not very powerful

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Success

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> GitHub also has annoying issue with caching images , so sometimes badge in readme rendered in GitHub gets old red color even though build succeeded

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> It’s known issue

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yay

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> There is no problem with Raku.land by the way it renders always actual value

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Btw if you are interested in adding ci for your other projects - just follow these steps - https://sparrowdo.wordpress.com/2025/02/26/no-code-ci-for-raku-modules/

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ask for credentials in Raku IRC channel on Libera chat

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for your help - fwiw I think that sparky is a lot quicker than GHA ;-)

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Spareky allow GitHub based authentication ( oauth2) but meanwhile I have something simple in mind . In a future if there is need I might switch it to gh auth

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Interesting … it should not because like I said vm is not very impressive

[16:32] *** euandreh left

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Or you mean in a sense of setup ?

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i hear that GHA uses all the MS old fleet of 486 boxen

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Completely

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Ah … ok

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> So at least you have a privilege of an almost dedicated VM , haha

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Till it’s get cramped by other tenants )))

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> I also try to upgrade sparky Rakudo to keep up with latest version almost every release

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well it waas a very good experience (when I realised the report is under the number)

[21:59] <tbrowder> hi, i've lost my handle on routine rand again. i need a list of N random ints from a set (0..^M)

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is that pick or roll maybe?

[22:01] <tbrowder> ooh, forgot about them, thnx, i'll take a look

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: (^100).pick(5).say

[22:02] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar 8d62f88d3: OUTPUT: «(30 10 95 82 26)␤»

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (11 38 35 39 1) 

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: (^100).roll(5).say

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (46 44 10 32 38) 

[22:03] <evalable6> librasteve, rakudo-moar 8d62f88d3: OUTPUT: «(55 79 79 10 6)␤»

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> iirc, pick removes the chosen item from the pool, whereas roll can still select from the whole of the pool

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so roll will occasionally repeat an item

[22:09] <tbrowder> ah, looks like roll is the way. thank you!

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yw

[22:10] <tbrowder> but ^^ looks cool, too

[22:11] <tbrowder> repeat is ok for my use case
