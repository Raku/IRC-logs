[13:59] <[Coke]> can't remember if this is a known issue, just tried to install OpenSSL on windows, "no such file or directory" during the build

[14:07] <patrickb> this sounds like the long paths issue. Can you nopaste the full error?

[14:20] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/dde8dd6554bb43ec78670681925d2bf9

[14:24] <[Coke]> fired up a project I haven't run on this box since trying a new raku as part of the last release, went to reinstall modules, boom

[14:32] <patrickb> this is on 2024.12?

[14:50] *** abhinav left
[15:01] <ugexe> they are on moar-2024.10

[15:04] <[Coke]> I am? ugh.

[15:05] <[Coke]> I am. will try an update, thanks for noting that.

[15:06] <[Coke]> (so happy for rakubrew download!)

[15:08] <[Coke]> I did a JIC 'rakubrew build-zef' which died with "error: unknown option `hard'"

[15:09] <[Coke]> git version 2.45.2.windows.1

[15:09] <patrickb> ugexe: How did you know?

[15:10] <[Coke]> OpenSSL isntalled no issues with rakudo latest, thanks folks.

[15:10] <[Coke]> "did coke do the basic troubleshooting? probably not." :)

[15:14] <[Coke]> ok, HTTP::UserAgent now complaining.

[15:15] <[Coke]> "failed to rename"

[15:15] <[Coke]> (same gist)

[15:21] *** sjn left
[15:23] <ugexe> patrickb: one of the lines had something like `... in any statement_control at C:\rakubrew\versions\moar-2024.10\... ...`

[15:24] <patrickb> ðŸ˜¯

[15:27] <ugexe> Not sure why'd OpenSSL would start to install but http::useragent would fail with seemingly the same error

[15:29] <ugexe> [Coke]: i'd probably try doing some raku one-liners that rename paths of various lengths to see if you can trigger that error manually

[15:36] <ugexe> [Coke]: is it t/001-meta.t specifically that fails and no other tests?

[15:37] *** sjn joined
[15:41] <ugexe> my hunch is it would be related to relative paths somehow (which don't work with long paths, so we always need to absolutify paths going to moarvm) and some of the tests look like they pass a relative path to `use lib ...` 

[15:42] <ugexe> which makes me wonder if this line -- https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/3559bb9bc31773cdac341a039ba18b851465e530/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationStore/FileSystem.rakumod#L171 -- needs a `.absolute` on it (it might might also need .resolve as well or whatever resolves . and .., both of which don't work in a long path)

[15:42] <lizmat> wouldn't hurt, would it ?

[15:42] <ugexe> maybe here as well https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/3559bb9bc31773cdac341a039ba18b851465e530/src/core.c/CompUnit/PrecompilationStore/FileSystem.rakumod#L44

[15:43] <ugexe> well any additional code in the module loading path theoretically increases start-up time

[15:43] <lizmat> but IO::Paths need to be stringified at some point anyway, no?

[15:45] <ugexe> well sure, but that doesn't mean we aren't already absolutifying the path elsewhere first or in some situations. if we just add more .absolute calls then we end up going between io::path and strings unneccesarily 

[15:46] <ugexe> so if it doesn't fix any problem it is detrimental to add it just because

[15:46] <lizmat> ack

[15:46] <lizmat> anyway, .resolve is the most expensive one

[19:56] <patrickb> It's released. As always, `rakubrew self-upgrade` should do the trick.
