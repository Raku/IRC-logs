[08:26] <disbot4> <librasteve> lichtkind: I would say it is best practice if you are adopting / reviving a module that is no longer actively supported - of course you will be using a different auth and please increment the version number from the previous owner (ideally this should be done with consent of the original author, ior at least a good attempt to get them to respond)

[08:53] <lichtkind> librasteve_: thanks for answer, well my isse is twofold: yes on one hand i have to problem to take over the Color module which is community now so its abandoned from zoffix, so i dont have to contact anyone. my second issue is vast parts of the API i sincerely dislike and would change it since its mistake that I meade previously in perl world, but maybe we get away with a new API version 

[09:30] *** arkiuat left
[09:46] <disbot4> <librasteve> I would vote for a takeover since I think that we are allowing too much bit rot in our ecosystem (in fact I think we need a policy to identify, deprecate and remove abandoned modules)

[09:47] <disbot4> <librasteve> [for example I changed my username / auth from p6steve to librasteve some years ago, so all my prior modules are aging duplicates]

[10:40] <lichtkind> allright so i will try to pull the old module and see what can be done and make an API version update and try to support as much as I can from  old, same as I do on CPAN

[10:40] <disbot4> <librasteve> =b

[10:52] <wayland> I pushed a module with the incorrect name the other week that probably needs to be deprecated too :) .  

[10:54] <wayland> OTOH, our 100-year promise also depends on the ecosystem; we should probably have a "disabling" option (or something), where it doesn't come up in normal searches, but is still available if you specifically choose it (so that the old code continues to work).

[11:09] <lizmat> wayland: yeah, that's also part of https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/491

[11:10] *** arkiuat joined
[11:10] <lizmat> the idea being that you'd upload another version of the incorrect named module (which would verify the authority) and then use superseded-by to indicate the new modules name
