[13:50] <disbot6> <antononcube> Adding some new Raku-advent-calendar images today.

[13:56] <Voldenet> I really enjoyed the monadic programming article, nothing says christmas more than titanic death counts ;>

[13:57] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> Is multiple dispatch in Raku implemented via monomorphism?

[13:58] <lizmat> explain monomorphism in this context?

[13:58] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphization

[13:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> @Voldenet Yeah, I was wondering should I alternatively use (1) mushroom dataset, (2) RakuLLM-prompts collection , or ()

[14:00] <lizmat> shalokshalom it's my understanding that a type of process like happens *at runtime*

[14:00] <Voldenet> yeah mushroom dataset is nicer probably

[14:00] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> I know that multiple dispatch is mostly implemented at compile time

[14:01] <lizmat> in Raku, it is not

[14:01] <Voldenet> No, most languages don't implement multiple dispatch

[14:01] <Voldenet> in a way that raku does

[14:01] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm, all the alternative datasets have more complicated structure, except "fisher-iris".

[14:01] <lizmat> basically, when a multi is called, the call-site contains information with which it can then quickly determine which candidate to be called using so-called "guards"

[14:02] *** librasteve_ joined
[14:02] <lizmat> however, this happens at *run-time*, so the initial call will have to go through the try-binding process to determine the correct candidate

[14:03] <lizmat> shalokshalom perhaps check out https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/04/15/raku-multiple-dispatch-with-the-new-moarvm-dispatcher/ and associated articles

[14:04] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> thanks

[14:04] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> I meant in Raku

[14:04] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> Numerous people have confirmed this here before

[14:05] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> Thanks for the link

[14:05] <Voldenet> raku has dynamic dispatch, the most dynamic one - jit compiler is responsible for optimizing it

[14:05] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> most who implement multiple dispatch, do it dynamically

[14:05] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> I am talking about the type evaluation

[14:05] <disbot6> <shalokshalom> so what it dispatches it on

[14:06] <Voldenet> m: multi sub x(Str $n) { "Str" }; multi sub x(Any $n) { "Any" }; my Any $x = "test"; say x($x) # a lot of languages would insist on saying "Any"

[14:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «Str␤»

[14:08] <Voldenet> sadly plenty of languages (js, python) don't have dynamic multi dispatch built into languages, so you have to resort to rolling your own multi

[14:09] *** melezhik joined
[14:18] <librasteve_> m: say Str ~~ Any

[14:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[14:20] <librasteve_> I enjoyed (re) reading jnthn’s article … is 6guts.wordpress.com a community blog site? if so, may be nice to see if we can revive it a bit

[14:23] <[Coke]> I think that's jnthn's personal site.

[14:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> ahhh - i see it is jnthns musing over 15 years or so ...

[14:23] <lizmat> note, there's also: https://github.com/Raku/CCR/tree/main/Remaster/Jonathan%20Worthington

[14:23] <lizmat> I guess I need to include the final posts there 

[14:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> is there a "set of resources recommended for core devs" anywhere - i would like to make sure this is on the list

[14:26] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh CCR - that deserves a link on raku.org unless there are ano=y objections - should we pull in the 6guts items there?

[14:28] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh sorry, I guess that's what you mean - let me know if i can help (and your recommendation how to gather from wordpress to github md files)

[14:40] <lizmat> librasteve I'll take care of adding the remaining articles

[14:40] <lizmat> I'd really someone taking care of setting up CCR so that any remastered documents wind up on a nice (github.io) site

[14:55] <lizmat> *like

[14:57] <Voldenet> (actually, jit runtime is responsible, not compiler)

[14:59] <Voldenet> hm, I actually think raku runtime could do a bit of monomorphization and will do it

[15:01] <Voldenet> a bit like nodejs where you do `function(x) { switch(x.type)… }` – jit doing typeguards and magic methods is an obvious step

[15:03] <Voldenet> now that I spent some time pondering I'm not entirely sure if this kind of monomorphization isn't already done

[15:11] <lizmat> that's what dispatch does, but at runtime?

[18:07] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:10] <Voldenet> I'd assume that jit is making monomorphized code based on assumptions about types, so perhaps it can also do dynamic dispatch statically

[18:10] <Voldenet> somehow

[18:11] <mcmillhj> which method/submethod would I add logic to catch attributes that are passed to a class so I can then use them to set a private attribute? As an example, I want to create a `Point` class that accepts an `x` and `y` attribute but then want to actually store the (x, y) representation as a Complex number.

[18:12] <Voldenet> m: class Point { has Complex $!z; submethod BUILD(:$x,:$y){ $!z=$x+$y*i }; method x{$!z.re}; method y{$!z.im} }; say Point.new(x=>3,y=>4).x, " ", Point.new(x=>3,y=>4).y # mcmillhj

[18:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «3 4␤»

[18:13] <mcmillhj> oh cool, thank you

[18:13] <mcmillhj> I didn't realize you could reference them in BUILD without declaring them with `has`

[18:17] <Voldenet> BUILD actually accepts anything

[18:17] <Voldenet> as long as it's named

[18:17] <Voldenet> m: class Point { submethod BUILD(:$x,:$y){ say %_ }; }; say Point.new(:3x :4y :5foo :6bar)

[18:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6b47541e2: OUTPUT: «{bar => 6, foo => 5}␤Point.new␤»
