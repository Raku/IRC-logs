[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: 

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: - Use modern file extensions

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: - Clean up code, use modern features, improve readability

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: - Add coverage tests

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: 

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: Note: one test in t/120-templates.rakutest needed to be todo'd because

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: for some reason the more modern Template::Mustache makes that test

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: fail 9 out of 10 times.  Looks like it's producing the first element

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: of a hash of about 10 elements, and that produces the wrong thing

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ Pod-To-HTML/main: most of the time.

[20:27] <avuserow> I'm getting some unusual errors when installing LibraryMake-based modules when using Fedora's build of raku. It is erroring on `gcc: fatal error: environment variable 'RPM_ARCH' not defined` - which is pretty strange, I don't think I'm building anything related to an RPM 🤔

[20:27] <avuserow> oddly, on Fedora 40-42, LibraryMake itself fails to install with this error. On 43, LibraryMake installs but then hits this error when installing other modules

[20:32] <ugexe> it is probably being extracted from $*VM.config, which is based on what was used to build moarvm/rakudo

[20:32] <ugexe> m: say $*VM.config

[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «{ar => ar, arflags => rcs, arout => , as => as, asm => .s, asmout => -o , asmswitch => -S, auxclean => @:, be => 0, bindir => /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-2/bin, booltype => _Bool, can_specific_werror => 1, can_unaligned_int32 => 1, can_unaligned_int64…»

[20:32] <ugexe> you could try grepping that for RPM_ARCH

[20:33] <ugexe> alternatively you could look at the makefile generated by librarymake for whatever is giving you that error and see where RPM_ARCH is being injected

[20:35] <ugexe> actually just googling the error message makes me think you should have those set. the fact you see it with librarymake is just because it is running gcc (which is what wants the env var)

[20:35] <ugexe> https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/14o6g3f/environment_variable_rpm_arch_not_defined/

[20:39] <disbot1> <librasteve> o/ ... hi! I'm just dropping in to say that I released the new Hilite::Simple module via fez a couple of minutes ago (may take a while for it to get indexed and listed on raku.land) ... the idea is to have a way to make highlighted Raku code as HTML WITHOUT javascript or style tags which are blocked by the raw HTML widget in Wordpress .com

[20:39] <avuserow> yeah I found that reddit post earlier, it just seems like I should be getting those variables from somewhere rather than manually setting them... 

[20:40] <disbot1> <librasteve> Hilite::Simple is a cut down version of Hilite, and like its big sister, it uses Rainbow & RakuAST under the hood

[20:41] <disbot1> <librasteve> tomorrow I will go in and edit the Advent instructions to replace the rather wonky ACME module that writes your raku to a GitHub gist and then scrapes the formatted HTML back from GH (!)

[20:42] <disbot1> <librasteve> anyway - late now so this is just a bulletin - any objections, please mention me in your message and I will pick up tomorrow...

[20:48] *** apa_c left
[20:56] <avuserow> okay it looks like since CFLAGS includes `-specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-package-notes`, then gcc wants those variables. I found some Dockerfiles on GitHub where they truncate that spec file and that's a secondary way of solving it, but yuck

[21:35] <ugexe> yeah imo librarymake is not good. it was a fine prototype for what it needed to do when perl6 was in its early days of nativecall, but nothing more

[21:36] <ugexe> using stuff from $*VM.config, which is largely (entirely?) generated whenever rakudo is compiled, is obviously not a good idea

[21:58] <avuserow> I don't know tons about CFLAGS but I imagine some are nice to include from the OS (optimization and hardening ones) and some are annoying/problematic (like these RPM specs)

[22:00] <avuserow> interesting, looks like Fedora used to have a package for zef but it went away at some point
