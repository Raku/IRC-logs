[00:55] <disbot1> <nurturethevibe> Are there any maintained Raku discord packages?

[01:01] <disbot1> <iamllcoolray> There is only one package that I've found but the last commit was 3 years ago

[01:03] <ab5tract> Well, Raku distributions tend to age pretty decently, thank god

[01:04] <ab5tract> I think it only becomes considered unmaintained after some moths of an issue or PR being ignored

[01:04] <ab5tract> Otherwise, “it doesn’t need a fix unless you can break it”

[01:10] *** yewscion joined
[01:14] <ab5tract> I guess an exception of this is when protocols are shifting/advancing

[01:18] <tbrowder> timo did you just recently email the gnucash user list?

[10:14] <wayland76> ab5tract / librasteve : Thanks for the help with the Dockerfiles.  I was referring to https://hub.docker.com/r/tonyodell/rakudo-nightly/tags .  It turned out to be a permissions problem.  Now Raku::Pod::Render is complaining because it can't find npm, which is apparently needed for highlighting.  I can sort that one though :)

[11:13] <wayland76> Not sure whom I should tell, but while running a zef install that included Pod::To::HTML on the nightly branch, I got the following errors.  https://gist.github.com/wayland/bcac60c14256f523cda5f9f6f13f72eb .  Since Pod::To::HTML doesn't seem to have changed, I'm wondering if it's caused by a change in the nightly.  Probably a known bug, but thought I should mention it.

[11:31] <wayland76> timo / tbrowder : Is someone using GnuCash and Raku together?  

[11:33] <wayland76> nurturethevibe / iamllcoolray : Raku puts in a lot of effort to maintain backwards compatibility.  That's the foundation for ab5tract's comments.  

[11:48] <lizmat> wayland76: is that repeatable ?

[11:48] <lizmat> if so, please make an issue  :-)

[11:56] <wayland76> lizmat: OK.  On rakudo?  I'll try to reduce it to something a bit more minimal than what I have now.

[13:13] <tbrowder> wayland76: i'm working on a raku module that uses Yahoo Finance data for analysing some missing data in some very old tax records from the very early days of the internet. i was hoping to use perl Finance::Quote along with Gnucash but the old Yahoo Finance JSON API is no longer available.

[13:14] <tbrowder> BUT there is now https://financeapi.net which looks very usable. i am going  to add that to my mos

[13:16] <tbrowder> module and i will release it when i get it working for me. (probably without the api--that should be a separate module anyway)

[13:21] <tbrowder> i love gnucash, but i'm not a good enough bookkeeper to keep detailed records, and am too lazy to duplicate work our bank and financial firms already do and those records are already available.

[13:47] <tbrowder> i asked about timo and gnucash here because i saw a user "timo" on gnucash users email list.

[13:52] <tbrowder> btw, i just signed up for free financeapi.net acct and tried it out. i got yesterday's closing price for one of our securities and it checked out correctly according to Yahoo Finance. i haven't read anywhere yet what their timestamp is but it looks like seconds from one of our standard DateTime epocs.

[13:54] <tbrowder> try it, you'll like it, at least for us mkts. someone give me a symbol for a non-us stock and i'll try it out. it may require a country code, too.

[13:54] <tbrowder> antononcube can probably llm that stuff

[18:36] <tbrowder> what the best current module for making json queries to a remote server? i've used LibCurl, but i don't see any that are in the Fez archive.

[18:42] *** librasteve left
[18:51] <refactus> idk which is best but looks like http::useragent and http::tinyish are both at least current enough to be on zef instead of p6c or cpan. lots of other options if you search raku.land for curl or http, but most look pretty abandoned

[18:51] <timo> is there something you don't like about the http client that Cro has?

[20:34] <tbrowder> i forgot about the Cro* i always think its for local https stuff...

[20:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> ;-)

[20:45] <tbrowder> librasteve: yr query ok?

[20:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> hi tom - sorry i don't understand your question...

[20:54] <tbrowder> oh, i thought you were trying Cro with some kind of query to a remote server

[20:57] <disbot1> <librasteve> no, i was just reading the Cro docs to remind myself how to use Cro for JSON stuff ... there's a lot in HTMX about playing nice with JSON APIs so I thought I had better check that HARC can do that (the C in HARC being Cro, of course)

[21:03] <tbrowder> well i'm gonna try it out...after i get a handle on my desired query's json api

[22:33] <Voldenet> some people use `for @x { .say }`, but I really adore `(^@k).map({ @k[$_].say })` - it's essentially the same but a lot more playful
