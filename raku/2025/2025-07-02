[08:00] <ab5tract> Xliff: re: "Right, but then you'd have to add in whole dynamic naming convention routines because you'd need to add a method with a different name. "

[08:01] <tellable6> ab5tract, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[08:36] <ab5tract> but I'm not sure what you mean there. with multi dispatch, traits are significant pieces of the name

[13:31] <disbot3> <librasteve> Hi folks! I’m requirements gathering for hopefully a new raku.org website. I am hoping to get a concensus on the light / dark mode default - please can you take a moment to answer this informal poll over at Reddit ... https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1lpvuey/dark_or_light/

[13:32] <lizmat> shouldn't there be an option "automatic" ?

[13:34] <disbot3> <librasteve> the Air::Widget::LightDark currently can be toggled by an icon in the browser, or by changing the system dark/light mode - I anyway will improve that to detect the system setting on new page load (thus the iuuse #20)

[13:36] <disbot3> <librasteve> this is about whether people generally prefer Light or Dark mode (but will only apply when the browser JS cannot detect the system setting)

[13:42] <lizmat> that's not clear from the wording of the poll

[13:45] <lizmat> wordings of polls are *hard*

[14:03] <disbot3> <librasteve> yes indeed - I have edited and hopefully now clear

[14:48] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: maybe something like this to get the system default? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56393880/how-do-i-detect-dark-mode-using-javascript

[15:58] <tbrowder> librasteve: do you see my vote? reddit sometimes seems to know me, and sometimes not    :-(

[16:07] <disbot3> <librasteve> cant work out how to see votes in reddit app

[16:39] *** dakkar left
[16:41] <tbrowder> hm i vote for light mode

[16:41] *** yewscion joined
[17:10] <disbot3> <librasteve> turns out even the author of a poll has to vote in order to see the vote count

[17:11] <disbot3> <librasteve> (and there was me trying to stay scrupulously neutral)

[17:16] <apogee_ntv> lizmat: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Image-PNG-Portable/pull/1 Adds read functionality, I'll do metadata probably tomorrow.

[17:16] <apogee_ntv> I could do with a break from reading PNG filter specs :D

[17:17] <apogee_ntv> I added some basic unit tests too.

[21:19] <apogee_ntv> lizmat: No rush. I am planning to add metadata, would you prefer that in a separate PR or in the same one?

[21:20] <apogee_ntv> Possibly filters in PNG writing too, they're not that hard.

[21:25] <apogee_ntv> Those 2 things would cover about 98% of PNG usage in the wild.

[21:30] <tbrowder> guifa: thnx

[23:15] <tbrowder> hi, question on a new class object instantiation: if i create a role with lots of rw attributes with default values, can i use those values in submethod TWEAK for a class that "does" that role? in the class i need to create new attrs which mix those attr values into a new hash attribute keyed by an alpha key to provide a defined order.for example, a role might have attr/values of foo => 2, bar => 3, and in the derived class have a 

[23:15] <tbrowder> new hash attattribute with key a =  {foo => 2}; key b = {bar => 3}, etc.

[23:16] *** librasteve joined
[23:16] <tbrowder> i'm going to try it, but any thoughts are appreciated...
