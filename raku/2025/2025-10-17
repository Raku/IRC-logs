[01:50] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> not sure I know how to reproduce this: https://github.com/4zv4l/dfs/blob/main/Node.rakumod basically when I start one Node then add the other, it works, when I add data on the first node, they can sync right, but if I add data on the second node, it crashes, it seems when the first node request data to the second one, the second one doesnt receive the request, and I am not sure why..

[03:47] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> okay it works, I changed to Async and somehow, that works now xD

[03:47] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> feels great when the code works !

[05:38] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> there is a weird infinite loop sometimes the way the watch and stat time of the file is handled

[05:54] <ab5tract> I would use promises with manual vow keeping

[05:55] <ab5tract> Also, there's a race condition in your skip-file check as its currently written

[06:16] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> aaah must be that

[06:16] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> would you be able to enlight me more about the vow keeping you are talking about and that race condition ?

[08:31] <melezhik_> I am looking for volunteers passioned about QA. I need people with spare Linux boxes and qemu enabled to test Rocky Linux distortion using Raku and Sparky. We are going to run test in HPC mode in Sparky cluster which is fun stuff to do, but I need VM resources. Please let me know if you are interested ...

[08:34] <melezhik_> distortion -> distributive

[20:47] <arkiuat> in https://docs.raku.org/type/Any#method_iterator it says: "Most subclasses redefine this method for optimization, so it's mostly types that do not actually iterate the ones that actually use this implementation."

[20:48] <arkiuat> Does anyone have any idea what the part after the comma is trying to say?

[20:48] <arkiuat> I suspect there is a word or two dropped somewhere.

[21:07] <disbot10> <jubilatious1_98524> @arkiuat "This is the default iterator implementation, however as many subclasses actually redefine this method (for optimization)--this method is only used for a minority of types."

[22:37] <Voldenet> What it's trying to say is that Any.iterator is useless

[22:39] <Voldenet> because all it does is converting $thing into ($thing) and giving you iterator to that list

[22:40] <Voldenet> or rather, the only context where it makes sense in is where some sub only accepts iterator

[22:41] <Voldenet> but you want to give one-element iterable instead

[22:44] <Voldenet> in fact, it'd be more informative to simply link to the code :D `multi method iterator(Any:) { self.list.iterator }`
