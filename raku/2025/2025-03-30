[07:25] <grondilu> I mean I guess with that example it's not clear what's the purpose.

[07:26] <grondilu> m: my class Foo {}; class A is Foo {}; class B is Foo {}; sub (Foo:U :$foo) { $foo }(:foo(A)); # how to test if $foo is provided to the sub?

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> weekly: here's a new blog post on the HARC Stack (HTMX, Air, Red, Cro)  https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2025/03/30/the-harc-stack/

[12:13] <notable6> librasteve, Noted! (weekly)

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I just sawy you earlier post ... reviewing now

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - looks good to me - appreciate you including Air !

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - maybe it would be a good idea to ink to the vairous raku modules you mention (or in the case of Air to https://harcstack.org) ... ?

[22:11] <lichtkind> lizmat: i had plans for a rewrite to enabe more deeper manipulations but i have to read myself into it, its basically training for me for giving a raku talk

[22:13] <lizmat> well, it's a community module now, and anybody can help with that  :-)

[22:20] *** stanrifkin left
[22:23] <lichtkind> lizmat: and everything works with pull requests?

[22:23] <lichtkind> also the decomposition ops were a bit lacking if i recall corectly

[22:36] *** jpn left
[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah. I filed an issue for a slow decomposition (which is/was easy to fix.)

[22:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, it was about matrix inversion, not decomposition.
