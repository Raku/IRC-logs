[11:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> ^^ thank you Patrick for your first post - I have updated the advent GH to show it is scheduled for tonight ...

[11:25] <disbot6> <librasteve> korvo: are you ready to go for tomorrow??

[11:25] *** El_Che joined
[11:28] <disbot6> <librasteve> and any other budding authors who fancy turning their thoughts to an advent post - there are 3 slots remaining - so don't be shy

[17:09] <patrickb> librasteve: Can you help me get the syntax highlighting fixed for my post?

[17:47] <korvo> librasteve: Post 4475 is drafted. I'm doing a double-check of everything right now; one issue I see is that angle brackets aren't properly escaped.

[17:55] <korvo> Fixed. It seems that the angle brackets in rules like `rule lit:sym<name> { ... }` aren't being properly escaped after highlighting.

[17:58] <korvo> The formatting is really bad. It seems like Markdown blocks don't put any spacing between paragraphs? I'm not sure if you have a standard technique for fixing that.

[18:17] <disbot6> <antononcube> @korvo Did you write you post in Markdown, outside of WordPress?

[18:18] <korvo> Yes. I drafted my post by alternating /markdown and /html blocks.

[18:18] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hm… are you by any chance on macOS?

[18:19] <korvo> No, Linux.

[18:20] <disbot6> <antononcube> You might try to render the whole file as HTML using pandoc.

[18:21] <disbot6> <antononcube> Alternatively, you might covert it into HTML using “Markdown::Grammar”. (I hope.)

[18:21] <korvo> I can certainly do that. I can also highlight the non-Raku code blocks with pygmentize, too. I'm merely trying to follow the contributor's conventions as documented.

[18:21] <disbot6> <antononcube> Do you have a GitHub gist of your file? Or any other location.

[18:22] <korvo> https://gist.github.com/MostAwesomeDude/85f67849575fafb76becb6c9ebaa7604 Linked from the original PR.

[18:22] <disbot6> <antononcube> What I do — on macOS — I render the Markdown files using IntelliJ or One Markdown, then copy and paste those renditions in WordPress. Gives results ≈93% close to what it is published.

[18:24] <disbot6> <antononcube> I take a more detailed look after 30 min.

[18:25] <korvo> I just followed the guide at https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md. I don't mind choosing other rendering methods as long as folks don't mind that it might not look like other posts.

[18:31] <disbot6> <antononcube> I would say publish / schedule a good enough looking version. It can always be improved.

[21:01] <korvo> It might take a moment to arrive; my mail host is jank. This isn't urgent, though; like you say, the existing draft is good enough.
