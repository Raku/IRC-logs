[18:55] <Voldenet> > `(1,3,2,4,5,1).grep: -> $a, $b { $a < $b, True }`, for example could return (1, 3, 2, 4, 1)

[18:56] <Voldenet> I guess it'd be pretty hard to figure out what does this do

[18:59] <timo> so that behaves more like rotor?

[19:01] *** yewscion joined
[19:03] *** librasteve left
[19:03] <Voldenet> yeah, something like that

[19:05] <timo> and if you don't make the second parameter $b? it will just skip the test for that one and always spit it out?

[19:05] <ugexe> I wonder what is happening right now... aws and gcp both have outages

[19:05] <ugexe> https://downdetector.ca/

[19:07] <Voldenet> well, the original idea was this https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5899#issuecomment-2963639208

[19:07] <Voldenet> but I'm not very convinced of multi-valued grep

[19:11] <Voldenet> I'd expect multivalued grep to be more like .rotor(2 => -1, :partial).grep

[19:11] <Voldenet> m: (^5).rotor(2 => -1, :partial).say # for reference

[19:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0eef26e18: OUTPUT: «((0 1) (1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4))␤»

[19:12] <Voldenet> so it could match elements using current and next/previous element in a sequence…

[19:13] *** librasteve joined
[19:15] <Voldenet> maybe that would make more sense `grep( -> $a, $b { }, :batch)` `grep( -> $a, $b { }, :lag)` `grep( -> $a, $b { }, :lead`

[19:18] <Voldenet> :batch would process 2 elements at the time, :lead/:lag could provide two elements but do the filtering on "current" element(s) being first or last argument

[19:18] *** librasteve left
[19:20] <Voldenet> though it can all be made using .rotor/.batch
