[12:15] <[Coke]> japan has a lot more flavors than the 4 or so we have here in the states. :)

[12:15] <lizmat> yeah, I fondly remember the "Green Tea" flavoured KitKats in Japan  :-)

[12:47] <tellable6> 2025-04-13T13:58:12Z #raku <librasteve> wayland: imo Grammar Actions are the way to go with make/made ... there is a lot going on with grammars backtracking and so on that otherwise can make very thorny issues

[12:55] <jdv> there's a resturant named raku near where i live.  wonder if its related.

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I did not use Raku for any of them though.)

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am thinking my next graphics module to be about making SVG animations via Raku. The prototype for that was chess related. (Animating Knight's tour.)

[20:59] <timo> grondilu: `without $*rows|$*cols { ($*rows, $*cols) = await self.detect-terminal-size; }` in the example code you sent earlier, doesn't do what you want, i think

[20:59] <timo> m: my ($*rows, $*cols); without $*rows | $*cols { say "one" }; $*rows = 1; without $*rows | $*cols { say "two" }; $*cols = 99; without $*rows | $*cols { say "three" };

[21:03] <timo> i think this is the "negation of junction" thing that's a little odd

[21:05] <timo> m: my ($*rows, $*cols); without $*rows & $*cols { say "one" }; $*rows = 1; without $*rows & $*cols { say "two" }; $*cols = 99; without $*rows & $*cols { say "three" };

[23:08] <tbrowder> hi, i'm about to release a YUGE update to my Mi6::Helper distro and would appreciate any criticism from an early peek at https://github.com/tbrowder/Mi6-Helper/tree/next-ver/README.md

[23:26] <guifa> ugh, I really file like we need a "flatten by x levels" method

[23:32] *** wayland76 joined
[23:34] *** jpn left
[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa Can you expand on that?

[23:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (1) Only the first k levels, or (2) between k1 and k2 leverls.

[23:36] <guifa> (1)

[23:37] <guifa> so if you have ( (1,2) ), ( (3,4), (5,6) ) you end with (1,2), (3,4), (5,6)

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is a sub / function, flatten, of "Data::Reshapers" that does flattening upto max-level spec.

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Data-Reshapers/blob/fddf12d847e76b658f8c4d733e187a17d29289f4/lib/Data/Reshapers.rakumod#L362

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube>  use Data::Reshapers; flatten([[(1,2),],[(3,4), (5,6)]], :1max-level) # ((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)) 

[23:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is in my TODO list to implement flattening between min- and max levels.

[23:47] <wayland76> tbrowder: Should those references to other modules be links?  That'd be handy.
