[00:04] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> @jubilatious1_98524 haha that's easy part, but the problem is that the preceding consonant character cannot have a diacritic

[00:05] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> so this works தர்மம், but this should not ஹலீம்

[00:05] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524> @aruniecrisps Not easy for me because my Terminal programs balk at wide-characters. What is the name of the diacritic?

[00:06] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> it can be one of the following: TAMIL VOWEL SIGN I, TAMIL VOWEL SIGN AA, TAMIL VOWEL SIGN II, TAMIL VOWEL SIGN U, TAMIL VOWEL SIGN UU

[00:07] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524> Thx.

[00:16] <tbrowder> tonyo: you are one of my goto raku ppl!

[00:18] <tbrowder> (except i don't like the sys default unseen letters for the passwd for the fez/zef acct)

[00:30] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524> @aruniecrisps For the preceding character my best guess is you need a "Negative lookbehind" or a "Boolean condition check".

[03:46] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524> @aruniecrisps I can't get \c[TAMIL LETTER NA] to match itself. Is it possible the text you sent has been modified? I'm trying a few tests.

[03:49] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524>  raku  -ne 'say NFKD($_).map: *.uniname.raku for .trim.comb;' <<< $' நேரம் ' ("TAMIL LETTER NA" "TAMIL VOWEL SIGN EE") ("TAMIL LETTER RA") ("TAMIL LETTER MA" "TAMIL SIGN VIRAMA") 

[03:52] <disbot7> <jubilatious1_98524> Correction: trying to match \c[TAMIL LETTER MA] to itself, seems it is modified by \c[TAMIL SIGN VIRAMA].

[16:51] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> @jubilatious1_98524 i kinda figured something out, but i'm not sure if there is a way to change the mark specifically, without caring what the base letter is

[16:52] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> so i want to change று to றி

[16:52] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> i don't know that .samemark fits my use case here

[16:53] <disbot7> <aruniecrisps> because i would have to know exactly what the final base consonant is for it to work

[20:14] <disbot7> <.vushu> Hi @ab5tract now Christmas is nearing. I remember your snowflake example, which troubled you with rendering the codepoints and I fixed the issue on Raylib::Bindings.  I tried to make a clean C example which works, then tried to make a raku example, and then deduced that the problem lies in the parsing.   a const int * should not be Pointer[int32] but It should be CArray[int32] :cameliathink:    I updated the Raylib::Bindings to

[20:14] <disbot7> raku.land it should soon be up.    Here is the code example:  https://github.com/vushu/snowflakes-raylib-raku  Merry Christmas.
