[00:31] <japhb> Is there a way to get zef to tell me which of a pile of recursive dependencies is explicitly depending on an *old* version of a module?

[00:32] <japhb> Something wants to pull in DBIish 0.6.6, and I'm not sure how to find out what.  `zef rdepends DBIish:ver<0.6.6>` didn't seem to do the trick ...

[00:54] <ugexe> hmm, i would have expected that rdepends command to be sufficient. you can get a general idea by running zef install with --debug and looking at the output to see the batch of dependencies that brought it in (of which one would be the culprit)

[02:55] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> is there an lsp to use for Raku ?

[02:55] *** kylese left
[02:56] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @simon_sibl there's this: https://github.com/bscan/RakuNavigator

[02:57] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> i've used this, it's not exactly comparable to an LSP for say python, i've thought about taking this initiative but i feel like that's above my pay grade

[02:58] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> like i've thought about making an LSP for Raku, but 1) it's above my pay grade and 2) i'm working on lots of other side projects at the moment

[02:58] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> hmmm is it only for vscode ? 😆

[02:59] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> considering it's an LSP it should work with vim or emacs

[02:59] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> you'd probably have to do some configuration

[02:59] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> i just make do without an LSP

[02:59] *** arkiuat left
[03:00] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> not a huge fan of js bloat in my home directory, but I will check xD

[03:02] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> thanks for the link, I wish there could be a zef module for it in the future

[03:28] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> awesome!

[03:28] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> sorry if i'm not responding as quickly, i'm working on the Raku SDK for Datastar

[03:32] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> Haha no justification or excuse needed, I highly appreciate any time given  What is Datastar ?

[03:32] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> https://data-star.dev/

[03:33] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> it's basically in the same family of hypermedia frameworks as htmx, unpoly, alpine ajax, etc

[03:33] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> the difference is that this basically tries to completely take over frontend reactivity whereas the others are not really as opinionated

[13:34] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> Hi everyone, wanted to see if I could get some help on figuring out why the latest dist for DataStar isn't being indexed?

[13:52] <disbot6> <librasteve> how long ago did you fez upload it

[13:53] <disbot6> <librasteve> also suggest you zef update

[13:58] <disbot6> <librasteve> fwiw it takes a couple of hours for a fez upload to make it to zef info (and even longer to raku.land) earlier this week - seems a lot slower than it used to be

[13:59] <disbot6> <librasteve> tonyo: not sure if this counts as an issue

[14:02] <[Coke]> expected turnaround times should be documented somewhere.

[14:04] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve i ran mi6 release roughly 8-10 hrs ago

[14:04] <[Coke]> blin run on the unicode 17 run found one casualty, bisected to the nqp bump.

[14:05] <[Coke]> ww

[14:05] <disbot6> <librasteve> did you see the "You did it!..." line?

[14:05] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> yep @librasteve it showed up

[14:05] <disbot6> <librasteve> this is v0.0.5, right? (I can see v0.0.4)

[14:06] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> yep

[14:06] <disbot6> <librasteve> what do you see with fez list

[14:06] <disbot6> <librasteve> also please go to project root and go fez upload and report back

[14:07] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> =<< FATAL: Something went wrong: Dist exists.             Do you need to run 'fez login' again

[14:08] <disbot6> <librasteve> 8-10 hours sounds like an issue needed on fez to me ... this is pretty much what I saw but even slower ... it eventually made it btw

[14:08] <disbot6> <librasteve> yeah that FATAL means that the fez server also thinks that fez upload worked

[14:09] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> it's not showing on 360.zef.pm

[14:09] <disbot6> <librasteve> yeah - stick all this info in the issue ... I am out of ideas, sorry

[16:23] <patrickb> ab5tract: I solved all external blockers (PTY support, Windows support, var-args, retrieving sources from the server (thanks Liz & timo! for that one)). The debugger itself is now second on my list (only rakudo/rakudo#5060 is before). I plan to then finish up the debugger. But until all T::W issues I authored are solved, the debugger won't be ready for public consumption because it'll require a 

[16:23] <patrickb> few temporary T::W patches. I'm all the more happy about japhb's persistent work on T::W.

[16:23] <linkable6> RAKUDO#5060 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5060 Let `use` get default adverbs from META6.json

[16:27] <patrickb> that's my finger. I usually manage to keep it up to date.

[16:33] <ab5tract> now this is the kind of internet I love to see :D

[16:33] <ugexe> looking briefly at your comment in 5060 patrickb I don't know if the use of `EVAL` for parsing dependency names is accounted for or not

[16:34] <tonyo> i think i just fixed a bug on iti

[16:34] <tonyo> lizmat ^

[16:34] <tonyo> should be indexing again now

[16:34] <lizmat> tonyo++

[16:35] <lizmat> does that mean that uploads would have to be repeated?   Or that stalled uploads will be handled now?

[16:36] <tonyo> they should get backfilled

[16:36] * lizmat starts a run of the REA harvester

[16:36] <tonyo> it might be another 10 or 15 minutes

[16:37] <tonyo> probably at minimum

[16:37] <disbot6> <librasteve> tonyo++

[16:37] <lizmat> ok, will continue to monitor and ping you if it doesn't seem to be processing  :-)

[16:38] <tonyo> alright, the indexer runs every /5

[16:38] <lizmat> ok, no new updates so far  :-)

[16:47] <tonyo> alright, it put up 3 new dists

[16:48] <lizmat> cool, thanks!

[16:48] <disbot6> <librasteve> does  zef update

[16:48] <tonyo> are one of those the ones you were expecting or was there others?

[16:48] <disbot6> <librasteve> \o/ (on behalf of @aruniecrisps )

[16:50] <disbot6> <antononcube> "WWW::Gemini" has the very important update with the Gemini-3 models!! 🙂

[16:52] <disbot6> <librasteve> just added Air:ver<0.1.0> in under 2 mins, which is the great Air explosion (ie refactor)

[16:53] <ugexe> patrickb: what do you mean by "Ensuring we have a distribution object available in CURFS modules"? I do not understand this because CURFS does have and use distribution objects

[16:54] <tonyo> the newer API doesn't rely on the indexer to run, fwiw

[16:54] <tonyo> the indexer is just keeping track of the old lambda setup we had

[17:13] <patrickb> ugexe from what I understood the distro object was missing in scripts.

[17:13] <patrickb> scripts in CURFS that is

[17:14] <ugexe> it isn't available in scripts at all

[17:14] <ugexe> i.e. you can't use `$*DISTRIBUTION` in bin/foo.raku or t/mytest.rakutest period
