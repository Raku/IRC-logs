[08:34] <calm4x0F> there is a place where i can suggest dark theme in raku docs?

[08:35] *** abraxxa-home1 left
[08:36] *** arkiuat joined
[08:38] <Voldenet> calm4x0F: there's "toggle theme" on the bottom of the docs, but #raku-doc is the place

[21:59] <wayland> Do we have a Raku module for filling in forms on the command line?  Mainly I want to ask a series of questions, but if there's a form setup, that's even better.  

[22:02] <disbot1> <antononcube> ðŸ¤” Brian Duggan had a module that can provide the questions interaction. (I thinkâ€¦)

[22:04] <wayland> That'll be https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/Terminal::UI .  I also found https://raku.land/zef:japhb/Terminal::Widgets .  I was just wondering if people had recommendations, caveats, or other options.  

[22:04] <[Coke]> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Prompt

[22:04] *** japhb joined
[22:05] <wayland> [Coke]: Thanks!  I'll try that if it turns out to be more suited to my needs than the other two.  

[22:06] <disbot1> <antononcube> I tried https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/Terminal::UI , and had plans to use it.

[22:15] <wayland> .tell lizmat I noticed that I missed a comment of yours on 9th May in the #mugs channel.  You asked me "Do you think the design of App::Mi6 prohibits all the features you'd like to see added?"  My answer is that I've been working on a module that allows you to pass in a command and on object on the command line, and then it turns that into a method call on an object.  It's intended to be a more complicated version of MAIN in a way.  

[22:15] <tellable6> wayland, I'll pass your message to lizmat

[22:37] <Voldenet> I remember using Prompt and line completions in Linenoise were kind of tough to use because of native code callbacks

[22:38] <Voldenet> You get errors and warnings in form "no handler defined in native callback" or something like that

[22:41] <Voldenet> > Unhandled exception: No exception handler located for warn  at SETTING::src/core.c/control.rakumod:267

[22:42] <Voldenet> > 

[22:42] <Voldenet> or > An unhandled exception occurred in a native callback. This situation is not recoverable, and the program will terminate.

[22:42] <Voldenet> it's ok as long as you don't do dynamic completions subroutines

[22:48] *** japhb left
[22:51] <wayland> Good to know.  

[22:52] <Voldenet> it's a bit better than raw input, but probably not good fit for form

[22:53] <Voldenet> otoh Terminal::Widgets is very css-esque (uses box model), so it might be more familiar

[22:53] <Voldenet> â€¦unless you don't know css, then it's just weird :)

[23:08] <wayland> Yeah, I'm thinking Terminal::Widgets is the go at the moment :)
