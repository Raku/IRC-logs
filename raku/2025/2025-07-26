[02:41] <wayland76> melezhik: I asked ChatGPT the kinds of questions I'd have when looking at the Sparrowdo website.  Here are my results.  If you have articles on these topics, please place them prominently on the Sparrow website.  If not, well, feel free to copy-paste from the link to write such articles :)  https://chatgpt.com/share/68843fc2-1f4c-8012-b029-7895351738d6

[08:33] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> I just had an appreciation moment for Rakudo's implementation bootstrapping from a simple core (MoarVM and NQP) in a flexible way into a complex language (Raku), when struggling with re-building Rust, which is a monolith and requires a compiler just one version earlier at most to build

[08:38] <Voldenet> to be honest, the only good part of rust is being high performance

[08:38] <Voldenet> it feels horrible to use, it's slow to compile, it's extremely easy to do counted refs memleaks

[08:50] <Voldenet> in the end it's c++ where you trade remaining bits of comfort for more control

[08:55] <Voldenet> though I must admit, it really owns these techempower benchmarks ;)

[09:11] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> Also like C++ it's engineered to be usable for low-level programming

[09:11] <disbot4> <dr.shuppet> That's why it got into the Linux kernel for example

[10:26] <ab5tract> doh!

[10:26] <ab5tract> stupid typo :(

[10:26] <melezhik> .tell librasteve_: you may use any example you think is reasonable to use for a new Raku web site from https://sparrowhub.io/examples

[10:26] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to librasteve_

[10:27] <melezhik> .tell librasteve_: if you need anything fancier - please let me know - I will see what I can do

[11:23] <wayland> Regarding rust, I'm looking forward to https://github.com/ballsteve/xrust being usable enough to include in Firefox.

[13:34] <disbot4> <melezhik.> wayland: oh, that‚Äôs great , thanks üôè a lot . Funny enough ‚ÄúCompared to RakuDist‚Äù - Rakydist is a tool I created back then and was based on Sparrow, so I tricked AI making it think these are different products. I am reading this right now , but my first impression it surprisingly accurate and insightful information baked by artificial brain üß† haha üòÜ

[13:40] <disbot4> <melezhik.> So I would say it‚Äôs 70% accurate , however why AI missed sparky bit which would cover parallelism and distributed jobs

[15:19] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @arkiuat ` ~$ raku -e 'my $string = "old string"; tr/dol/wne/.put given $string; # OUTPUT: ¬´new string‚ê§¬ª'

[15:20] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my $string = "old string"; tr/dol/wne/.put given $string;

[15:20] <disbot4> <Raku eval>  new string 

[15:21] <lizmat> m: say "old string".trans("dol" =>"wne")

[15:37] <arkiuat> yeah, all that old string new string stuff was just trying to figure out which ACCEPTS method is called by ~~ when a tr/// is to the right of it. 

[15:37] <arkiuat> librasteve helped me figured it's the ACCEPTS method from class Code
