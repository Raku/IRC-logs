[23:17] <tbrowder> is there any way to use map on an array or list to produce the array inverted so the array.kv becomes %h<v> = k?

[23:24] <SmokeMachine> would someone like to proofread and gimme your opinion about this? https://github.com/FCO/Sourcing-FoodDelivery-example/blob/main/first-post.md

[23:31] <tbrowder> for the moment i'll just try "is cached" on a sub to handle the situation

[23:37] <SmokeMachine> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my %b = @a.kv.reverse; dd %b

[23:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 992f7417b: OUTPUT: ¬´{:a(0), :b(1), :c(2), :d(3), :e(4)}‚ê§¬ª

[23:39] *** thundergnat joined
[23:40] <thundergnat> m: my @a = 'a'..'g'; my %b = (@a.pairs).invert; say %b;

[23:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 992f7417b: OUTPUT: ¬´{a => 0, b => 1, c => 2, d => 3, e => 4, f => 5, g => 6}‚ê§¬ª

[23:41] <SmokeMachine> 23:40 <thundergnat> m: my @a = 'a'..'g'; my %b = @a.antipairs; say %b;

[23:41] <SmokeMachine> (Sorry)
