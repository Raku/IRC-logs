[01:16] <[Coke]> it resulted from something i was considering putting into core for the repl and then lizmat created several modules that were outside and much better.

[20:28] <arkiuat>  re that August 10 discussion of set typing and IntStr, I've since given a closer reread to https://docs.raku.org/language/quoting , so now I understand better that the < angle bracket > list constructors are like qw// with added allomorph-construction functionality. That cleared up most of my confusion.

[21:27] <lichtkind> lizmat: cheers - how much is it frowned upon around here to release a module under same name as existing?
