[00:45] <japhb> Hey all!  I've released some updates for Terminal::Capabilities (which is used by a fair number of my other Terminal::* modules). 0.0.9 has support for detecting the actual terminal program underneath screen, tmux, and Zellij multiplexers.

[00:45] <japhb> If there are any other multiplexers you think I should support, please let me know.

[00:46] <japhb> Also, if the terminal-autodetect script provided by that module doesn't correctly detect your particular terminal, I'd love to know that too, so I can add support!

[00:52] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @tbrowder_04810 I used to use LibCurl::Easy, but don't see it up on raku.land now... .

[08:46] <disbot> <librasteve> @lizmat - just to feedback from yesterday - what I ended up with is Map.new: Script => ::('Script') ... took a while to realise that I actually wanted the symbolic reference

[08:46] <tellable6> 2025-10-12T23:19:17Z #raku <arkiuat> librasteve: I can't argue with that. Marketing was a black art even before we started trying to market free stuff, which makes it even more mysterious afaict

[08:48] <lizmat> librasteve I'm surprised, didn't    Script => Script     do the trick ?

[08:50] <disbot> <librasteve> yes - that works as a literal ... but then I have a couple of dozen roles so this all needs to be interpolated ... so my actual code is

[08:51] <disbot> <librasteve> sub EXPORT {Map.new: functions-air-base-tags.map: {$_ => ::($_)} }

[08:51] <lizmat> ah, ok, yeah, sure, that works  :-)
