[09:18] <wayland76> Where do I send PRs for community modules (like https://github.com/raku-community-modules/XML/pull/71 ) so that they get some attention?  

[09:18] <wayland76> (Hi again :) )

[09:19] <wayland76> If anyone is interested, I added "does Positional" and the tests ran fine, but when I tried adding "does Associative", they almost all failed, even though the class in question already has an AT-KEY method.  

[09:24] <lizmat> wayland76: there's a #raku-community-modules channel where you can ask questions like these

[09:25] <lizmat> which also is where Geth posts updates

[09:28] <wayland76> Lovely!  Thanks!

[11:04] <thundergnat> wayland76: ‚âΩ is a deprecated operator. It used to mean "is a super set of" or "contains".

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: I would be happy to f/back on the bikeshedding - looks like tbrowder is going to resubmit a new PR with changes so far

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: please can you put a link here to the new PR when it's ready so that I can tear it to shreds ;-)

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw I have checked that yoou can enter the literal unicode char into the docs search üêßand it will get correctly pushed up to google search and back down to a valid result list

[15:15] *** librasteve_ joined
[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland76: would you be kind enough to raise an issue (ideally a PR) to remove the deprecated operator (or maybe better to describe it's status)

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> wayland76: I went through a lot of trial and error with Positional and Associative to make a DataFrame in the Dan module you are welcome to review what I settled on https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Dan/blob/d2661dbc4affaf5847307f27d17a2aa5a4d23cc4/lib/Dan.rakumod#L794

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the idea was to implement cascading accessors like say df[0][0];, say df[0]<A>;,say df{"2022-01-03"}[1]; and so on

[15:24] *** nil78 joined
[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I ended up with role DataFrame does Positional does Iterable {} so chose to implement the Associative aspects with custom postcircumfix instead of AT-KEY

[15:29] *** Aedil left
[15:48] <timo> please be aware that operators are part of the language, in other words lexically scoped. if you put the object in any code that tries to use postcircumfix:<{ }> on it, it will use the core version, not your custom one

[15:53] <timo> you might also be interested in `has @!data handles <iterator flat lazy hyper Numeric list>;`

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> timo: good point - it works for my case, since my class specifically does NOT claim is Associative or similar

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nor does it have an AT-KEY method

[21:16] <wayland> librasteve: Thanks!  Regarding Positional and Associative, I did the same with TOP, though I relied heavily on Hash::Agnostic and Array::Agnostic (after appropriate bugfixes).  The Positional stuff on XML was an easy fix; Associative will be harder, but I think it'll just be a matter of reading the docs and looking for other functions to implement or something.

[23:49] <SrainUser> Parallelism with "start" in for loops seem unreliable. When I run:

[23:50] <SrainUser> for 1..5 {

[23:50] <SrainUser> 	start {

[23:50] <SrainUser> 		say "hi";

[23:50] <SrainUser> 	}

[23:50] <SrainUser> }

[23:50] <evalable6> SrainUser, rakudo-moar 0bfbf5fa8: OUTPUT: ¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[23:50] <SrainUser> I get different amounts printed with each run. Is this normal?
