[14:54] <disbot3> <librasteve> wayland76: thanks for pointing that out - guess I am already too dependent on robots

[14:56] <[Coke]> librasteve - you see my note about the parrot release version?

[14:56] <[Coke]> can you please update that blog post to reflect the parrot version in question?

[15:33] <disbot3> <librasteve> wayland: fyi I cross posted Pathway sof Entry to reddit r/rakulang and so far it achieved 1.8k views (this is a lot) ... in many of your posts you raise interesting issues that warrant some discussion - personally I find Reddit is good for that kind of conversation - if you are amenable then please can you login over there and address some of the points I have raised?
