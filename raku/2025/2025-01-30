[22:26] <tbrowder> hi, just updated to Rakudo 2025.01 and getting error “New type Stash for Signature is not a mixin type”. i found the old bug report and added .^is_mixin tests on two of my class objects most likely to be the problem but i’m still debugging. is there a way to apply a .^is_mixin test to a sigmature? note i cannot say the upgrade caused the new error—code thrash is going on…

[22:27] <tbrowder> thnx for any ideas

[22:29] <tbrowder> more info: msg occurred when a script was being compiled. load tests of the 30+ modules show no problems.

[22:39] <[Coke]> what's the bug id?
