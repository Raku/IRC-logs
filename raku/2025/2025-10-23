[07:53] <sibl> well thats sure its not terribly hard project to make xD but I am not an expert as well, so far I made the UI in few lines with Terminal::UI, I just found IRC::Client from @lizmat, I will see if I can simply use this and glue it to the UI

[11:18] <disbot1> <librasteve> guess I just need to get in the habit of going to the IRC logs https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/live.html ... that said having that as viewable from my terminal in the context of the IRC client would be a killer feature!

[11:19] *** lizmat left
[11:24] *** arkiuat left
[11:26] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> The feature would be to log the messages when you’re connected right ?

[11:30] <disbot1> <librasteve> one of the main reasons I have to juggle Discord and IRCcloud windows is that the IRCcloud app has an unpredicatable coverage of previous messages in the channel - the Discord experience which I value is to have a continuously scrollable and fully searchable message history regardless of my logged on status ... the standard terminal IRC client (irssi) only gives me the live chat. I would be happy to setup each channel I care

[11:30] <disbot1> about with a url to go fetch the chat history (or just to have that hardwired for raku channels) ;-)

[11:41] *** arkiuat left
[11:41] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> oh I see, otherwise I was wondering how that would be possible xD if I can add a plugin system, can be added that way (per channel script to fetch and append the downloaded logs to the channel logs variable for example)

[12:36] *** arkiuat joined
[12:37] <disbot1> <librasteve> well, I think its because of furstration that each time I logout my laptop (which I do a lot) when I log back in after some time, then I have to click to rejoin all the channels and the backlogs are not available for quite a long time - now you mention, I checked and I see that since I have been logged in a while I can now click to load more backlog (but htis is the first time that this has worked for me since by then I have

[14:02] <arkiuat> heh, I totally did not intend to assign that to [Coke]: github did it automatically. I don't think it's even a docs issue; rather, it's consensus needed in order to resolve a blocked docs issue

[14:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: ( no output )

[14:17] <disbot1> <librasteve> Word from the perlistas ... There's a late push for an LPW this year.  Also called the LPRW when they feel like it. https://www.londonperlworkshop.com/ There's a feedback mechanism on that page.

[14:17] <disbot1> <librasteve> weekly: https://www.londonperlworkshop.com/

[14:17] <notable6> librasteve, Noted! (weekly)

[14:19] <ugexe> i assume the unit thing is due to namespacing

[14:19] <disbot1> <librasteve> yeah - I saw it recently - sub EXPORT cannot be within the package class

[14:20] <arkiuat> yeah, I'm just trying to make the docs less confusing

[14:21] <arkiuat> I opened the problem-solving issue because the related docs issue is seven years old and has been in blocked status for almost two years

[14:21] <disbot1> <librasteve> note this is not the same as my package EXPORT::DEFAULT {...} which afaik can live within the class

[14:21] *** dakkar joined
[14:21] <disbot1> <librasteve> arkuiat: ++

[14:21] <ugexe> I'd also guess that allowing arbitrary subs before unit is a rakudo quirk, not design

[14:22] <disbot1> <librasteve> personally I would be happy to outlaw combining unit and sub EXPORT - but then I am not a big user of unit

[14:22] <arkiuat> that would be my guess too, but I don't think we have anything in ROAST to make sure that only a sub named EXPORT is allowed beforehand

[14:22] <disbot1> <librasteve> whatever is decided we should probably add to ROAST

[14:23] <arkiuat> well, that would break code, librasteve, since it has never been outlawed before

[14:23] <disbot1> <librasteve> then deprecate now and release in 6.e

[14:23] <disbot1> <librasteve> (??)

[14:23] <arkiuat> disallowing unit packages to use EXPORT seems kind of arbitrary to me (I do use unit)

[14:26] <disbot1> <librasteve> OK - fair enough. So lets just go with the flow - but add the current rakudo behaviour as a ROAST test from 6.e.

[17:59] <disbot1> <m_zero> is there a difference between @a[3] and @a.[3]?  They seem to produce the same results.

[18:00] <disbot1> <m_zero> (similarly for %a{'x'} and %a.{'x'})

[18:15] <arkiuat> I think they're exactly equivalent

[18:15] <arkiuat> basically subscripting is treated as a special kind of method call, I think? 

[18:15] <Voldenet> > diff <(raku --target=ast -e 'my @a; @a[3]') <(raku --target=ast -e 'my @a; @a.[3]')

[18:15] <Voldenet> see for yourself

[18:16] <Voldenet> the difference in diff is basically only text, not operations

[20:55] <ds7832> In q-quoted strings, the syntax \qq[...] can apparently also be used with delimiters other than []. This apparently isn't required by any roast, though. Is this still intentional? In that case I would add a sentence to the documentation.

[20:56] <ds7832> m: my $var = 'foo'; say '<code>$var</code> is <var>\qq«$var.uc()»</var>';

[20:56] <evalable6> ds7832, rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) ===SORRY!===␤Couldn't find termin…»

[20:56] <evalable6> ds7832, Full output: https://gist.github.com/3916448341fae34e38de6c63497960e3

[20:57] <ds7832> okay, «» doesn't work, but with {} or <> it does:

[20:58] <ds7832> m: my $var = 'foo'; say '<code>$var</code> is <var>\qq{{{$var.uc()}}}</var>';

[20:58] <evalable6> ds7832, rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «<code>$var</code> is <var>FOO</var>␤»

[21:00] <librasteve_> sorry I don’t understand …

[21:01] <ds7832> and in fact, «» also works, as long as ther closing deliminter isn't used ambiguously:

[21:01] <ds7832> my $var = 'foo'; say '<code>$var</code> is <var>\qq«{$var}»</var>';

[21:01] <evalable6> ds7832, rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «<code>$var</code> is <var>foo</var>␤»

[21:01] <ds7832> m: my $var = 'foo'; say '<code>$var</code> is <var>\qq«{$var}»</var>';

[21:01] <evalable6> ds7832, rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «<code>$var</code> is <var>foo</var>␤»

[21:02] <ds7832> librasteve_: Currently the documentation (docs.raku.org/language/quoting#Escaping:_q) only gives the example of \qq[...]

[21:03] <disbot1> <librasteve> link?

[21:03] <ds7832> With rakudo, delimiters other than [] work as well, e.g. {}, <>, or also «» (if used unambiguoisly)

[21:03] <disbot1> <librasteve> docs link?

[21:04] <disbot1> <librasteve> i mean its a given in Q slang that any delimiter is ok ... so not sure what you are saying

[21:05] <ds7832> librasteve: I hope the link from the message at 23:02 works. 

[21:05] <disbot1> <librasteve> nope

[21:05] <ds7832> Yes I think it's very logical that other delims should work too

[21:05] <ds7832> as

[21:05] <ds7832> ah*

[21:05] <disbot1> <librasteve> need link to offending docs pls

[21:05] <ds7832> https://docs.raku.org/language/quoting#Escaping:_q

[21:05] <disbot1> <librasteve> tx

[21:06] <disbot1> <librasteve> hmmm

[21:07] <ds7832> So it works and it seems right that it should work. Looking for confirmation though before adding it explicitly to the docs

[21:07] <disbot1> <librasteve> no need to change the doc imo

[21:07] <disbot1> <librasteve> do a PR and I can review
