[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I want to supplement the package "Graph" with graph data. Each record of that data is, say, a map/hash/dictionary with keys: "AdjacencyMatrix", "Vertices", "Edges", "IncidenceMatrix", "Faces", etc.

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think that should be a package separate from "Graph", because of its, potentially, large size. What is a good name for that additional package?  1. Graph::Data 2. Data::Graph 3. GraphData

[14:56] *** greaser|q joined
[14:56] *** GreaseMonkey left
[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was/am thinking option 1, "Graph::Data", but there are other "Data::*" packages, and "GraphData" has some merrits two.

[14:57] <lizmat> Graph::Data feels most logical to me?

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I plan "Graph::Data" to be independent of "Graph", actually. To be just a "front-end" to a certain JSON database (of graphs.)

[15:02] <lizmat> then I'd say Data::Graph  :-)

[15:04] *** yewscion joined
[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... maybe I should make a "front end" to House of Graphs (HoG) first.

[15:16] *** ulipink left
[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Agreed, "Data::Graph" is better if independence from "Graph" is one of the features.

[19:42] <[Coke]> is there a regex explainer in the ecosystem?

[19:45] *** ulipink left
[19:47] *** Aedil left
[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, via LLMs. üôÇ

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This was recently requested and discussed with @timo .

[19:57] <[Coke]> I mean a procedural one, but thank you for the option.

[19:58] <timo> i only wrote a tiny amount of an idea for the procedural one

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was mostly joking, but  I made a demo for @timo  üôÇ https://discord.com/channels/538407879980482560/633753286209699870/1327989265107521627

[19:58] <timo> thtat link doesn't do much for irc or matrix users i'm afraid

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Got too busy with other things, in order to follow up with timo's suggestions.

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> How about this link: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/633753286209699870/1328007112135020647/Raku-simple-Regex-explainer-2.png

[20:02] <timo> "This content is no longer available."

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmmm.... I see it in Discord...

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a a copy:

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1336064515556642816/image.png?ex=67a2728b&is=67a1210b&hm=a1499a0fe3b0153a2033603be55f8dd3baeceda6c49bf7d79a07da9abf8d25f5&

[20:03] <timo> discord decided against being "everyone's free media storage" at some point, so you now need a bit more than just the URL to actually get access

[20:04] <timo> that link works, but i assume it will expire at some point

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> FWIW, the "regex explainer" discussion between @timo and I was on 2025-01-12.
