[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Has anyone tried DeepSeek ?

[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Nope. Only simple find üòÇ

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Unfortunately, their API-key application service is down... If I get an API key I can start making "WWW::DeepSeek". It is seems it adheres to OpenAI's API, at first glance.

[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Ah. Ok. So you‚Äôre just playing with it or you have some practical purpose?

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, all LLM models I have / use, are ultimately for some practical application. The big "promise" or feature of DeepSeek is that in can provide a reasoning model comparable to OpenAI's that can be run, say, locally.

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But, instead of "going local", I wanted to try their Web API first.

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Ok ‚úÖ

[18:13] * [Coke] opened https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/227 - if someone could review (and maybe help me figure out why Patrick's commit is showing there...

[18:17] <timo> could be you accidentally had that commit checked out before you started work on your branch. you can ask "git reflog" or maybe "git reflog --all" to show you where your HEAD was over the last steps you did and where your branches were and what-not

[18:18] <timo> oh

[18:19] <timo> that commit was on "master" and apparently "main" is now the main branch instead

[18:19] <timo> so you were basing your work off of "master" which had the logo-related commit that wasn't in "main" yet

[18:20] <timo> [Coke]: do we want to have the irc webchat link open in a new window/tab by default?

[18:22] <[Coke]> oops. I'll fix that.

[18:22] <[Coke]> (new window) I didn't change that, only the target URL

[18:22] <timo> right

[18:22] <timo> it was a suggestion for the future

[18:22] <[Coke]> we should do the same on doc-website, whatever we decide.

[18:22] <timo> right

[18:23] <timo> could bounce everything off of raku.org/irc and raku.org/dev-irc if we are sure we never want to use that URL for something else

[18:23] <timo> otherwise webirc.raku.org could be made and that could redirect so we can point at it from one spot

[18:26] <[Coke]> ... and it's not? https://raku.org/irc

[18:27] <timo> is that where the .htaccess from source/ is installed to? do we actually host that on apache?

[18:51] <tonyo> alright, local testing for the new zef eco is underway

[19:01] <tonyo> old fez clients will continue to work for the foreseeable future, but the go live will be accompanied by a fez update that will update the upload endpoint (and start giving live feedback when uploading).  the update will cause the old upload endpoint to stop working

[19:02] <tonyo> uploads using the old client will delay showing up in the index further but will still show up

[19:09] <[Coke]> can we get a point release on the old client to explain why it's not working?

[19:10] <[Coke]> ... or will an update just take them to the new client at this point anyway? (unclear if it's the same module)

[20:26] <tonyo> update will take them to the new client

[22:23] <tonyo> oops

[22:24] <tonyo> with this, too, fez will be able to handle multiple ecosystems to upload to, so you won't be tied explicitly to zef, though i do have plans to build some web UI stuff to help you manage dists for zef specifically

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sounds like soft lock in to me (nice!)

[22:26] <tonyo> and for those of you waiting on me to fix the META index, that should also be fixed with this and the skipped versions will start showing up in the index (as quickly as it takes me to write some migration stuff)
