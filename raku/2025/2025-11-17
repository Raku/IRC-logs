[01:10] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> I'm running into a weird bizare issue with Red @SmokeMachine , it looks like for some reason that whenever I try and read a record, it's not able to fetch the record from the database in time for me to pass it into the next call

[01:11] *** itaipu joined
[01:14] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> I think it had something to do with me trying to mixin a role Base with $.id, $.created-at, and $.updated-at into a model, but I would imagine it should work

[01:35] *** arkiuat joined
[01:40] *** arkiuat left
[01:54] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: can I see your code, or some simplification reproducing the problem?

[01:55] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> let me do one thing, i'll make the repo visible on gitlab so you can check it out yourself

[02:00] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> actually here's a simplification.  Dictionary::Models::Base (lib/Dictionary/Models/Base.rakumod)  unit role Base;  has $.id is serial; has $.created-at is column;  has $.updated-at is column;   Dictionary::Models::Word (lib/Dictionary/Models/Word.rakumod)  use Red:api<2>; use Dictionary::Models::Base;  unit model Word is table<words> does Base;  also is rw; also is export;  has Str      $.raw-text      is column; has Bool   

[02:00] <disbot1>  $.is-root       is column = True;  method get-by-raw-text(Str $raw-text) {     self.^all.grep({ $_.raw-text eq $raw-text && $_.is-root }).head }   place of invocation:  my Word:D $word .= get-by-raw-test: "hello" # this does return a Word:D  say $word.id # this breaks for some bizarre reason, but it used to work earlier 

[02:01] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> here is the source code for it

[02:12] <SmokeMachine> What can you share how you run it and what happens if you add my $*RED-DEBUG = True?

[02:17] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> I run it using cro run

[02:18] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> This is the error that I'm getting   ⚠ himal_dictionary Cannot resolve caller id(Word:D: ); none of these signatures matches: ⚠ himal_dictionary     (Mu:U $:: *%_) ⚠ himal_dictionary   in block  at /Users/arun/Documents/Projects/himal_dictionary/lib/Himal/Dictionary/Controllers/WordController.rakumod (Himal::Dictionary::Controllers::WordController) line 16 ⚠ himal_dictionary   in block  at

[02:20] <SmokeMachine> I’ll have to take a look at it tomorrow after day job, sorry…

[02:20] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> No worries, take your time, this is a side project for me as well so I'll probably have a look at it tomorrow

[15:09] <disbot1> <librasteve> or two

[15:10] <tbrowder> i’m sorry i messed up the advent pr merge and the overlap between antononcube needs fixing. he was first  but i didn’t notice it. been having internet problems here

[15:11] <disbot1> <librasteve> @antononcube all authors should have DRAFT edit rights on the advent wordpress, I guess that means you have full control until the post is scheduled for publish

[15:32] <tbrowder> with 3 entries

[15:33] <tbrowder> i only had 1

[22:57] <patrickb> I have a module that should conditionally use the new var-arg feature of rakudo 2025.12 onwards. The code will fail to compile on older rakudos though. How can I guard that code?

[22:57] <patrickb> I guess something with BEGIN...

[22:57] *** arkiuat left
[23:00] <patrickb> https://git.sr.ht/~patrickb/Terminal-API/tree/main/item/lib/Terminal/API.rakumod#L91 <-- this line should read `sub ioctl(int32, uint64, **@varargs --> int32) is native {*}` and be guarded to be invisible on older rakudos.

[23:00] *** arkiuat joined
[23:05] *** arkiuat left
[23:05] <patrickb> Maybe something like this?: EVAL BEGIN { if $*RAKU.compiler ~~ /rakudo/ && $*RAKU.compiler.version < v2025.12 { 'sub ioctl(int32, uint64, **@varargs --> int32) is native {*}' }
