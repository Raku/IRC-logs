[02:22] <johnjaye> question. is there a reason that variable names cannot have dashes followed by numbers? i read this and found things like x-6 are not allowed as variables

[02:29] <ugexe> it would be ambiguous with subtraction

[08:39] <ab5tract> johnjaye: note that you can use single quotes in identifiers

[08:40] <ab5tract> I think that applies also to variable names, but alas my iPhone keyboard doesn’t seem to have a proper single quote to try it out with

[09:11] <librasteve_> tonyo: we are looking at 20 mins talks (ie 15 mins + Q&A) and maybe a longer format if there are speakers and sufficient time

[09:11] <tellable6> 2025-10-09T03:54:47Z #raku <tonyo> librasteve: how long of a talk need it be?

[09:12] <lizmat> simon_sibl one nit: is that how you spell dictionary ?   :)    but cool indeed  :-)

[09:13] <librasteve_> m: my $o'dell = 42; say $o’dell;

[09:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable '$o' is not declared. Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this was␤intended to be part of a signature?␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my $o'dell = 42; say <HERE>$o’dell;␤»

[09:14] <librasteve_> my $o'dell = 42; say $o'dell;

[09:14] <librasteve_> m: my $o'dell = 42; say $o'dell;

[09:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[09:15] <lizmat> yeah, the second ' was a  2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK ’

[09:15] <librasteve_> (turns out macOS terminal interprets “‘” differently to IRCcloud)

[09:15] <librasteve_> neat demo of why this feature should be avoided!

[09:22] <disbot5> <librasteve> @simon_sibl one neat trick with regex (and thus Grammars) is to use look ahead assertion to employ the built in raku syntax, for example

[09:22] <disbot5> <librasteve>  my regex number {     \S+                     #grab chars     <?{ +"$/" ~~ Real }>    #assert coerces via '+' to Real } 

[09:23] *** arkiuat joined
[09:24] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> lmaooo sorry xD native french xD

[09:24] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> I will fix this xD

[09:27] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> sorry I am probably tired, would that help making the grammar I made easier ? I try to keep it short, would that help while keeping it not "bloated" xD

[09:27] <Voldenet> ' in variable names is cursed code - I once made a toy programming language that allowed spaces and tabs in variable names

[09:27] <Voldenet> it was horrible idea

[09:28] *** arkiuat left
[09:29] <disbot5> <librasteve> Voldenet: amen to that - the only use case that I could imagine would be to have a single quote at the end such as my $a; my $a'; my $a''; (ie a prime, a douple prime) as in math / physics notation - but that is explicitly disallowed in raku identifiers anyway

[09:30] <Voldenet> instead of a'' consider a"

[09:31] <disbot5> <librasteve> @simon_sibl - if you are looking for an Int, then standard regex digits (as you have) is definitely better - I was just mentionning in case you want to parse something like a Num or Rat

[09:31] <Voldenet> but $a_ and $a__ is actually good replacement

[09:31] <disbot5> <librasteve> excellent point

[09:31] <lizmat> I guess one of the reasons for allowing ' in identifiers is:

[09:31] <lizmat> m: m: sub don't($a) { say "do not $a" }; don't "foo

[09:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in double quotes; couldn't find final '"' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> on't($a) { say "do not $a" }; don't "foo<HERE><EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤…»

[09:31] <lizmat> m: m: sub don't($a) { say "do not $a" }; don't "foo"

[09:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «do not foo␤»

[09:32] <disbot5> <librasteve> .oO ... that makes (very limited) sense

[09:39] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> silly quick question, how does zef/Rakuland find new raku module ?

[09:39] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> or "how to submit a module"

[09:40] <disbot5> <librasteve> you need "fez" for that

[09:41] <disbot5> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/language/modules

[09:42] <disbot5> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/fez

[09:43] <disbot5> <librasteve> also, many folk use App::Mi6 to automate release and change control

[09:43] <disbot5> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:skaji/App::Mi6

[09:47] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> thanks, I tried to upload the basic Bencode file xD lets see

[09:54] <Voldenet> m: sub d'_'b($a) { say "♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ﾟ.$a♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ﾟ." }; d'_'b "foo"

[09:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 21dd9921d: OUTPUT: «♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ﾟ.foo♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ﾟ.␤»

[11:34] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> well now I got a problem with Bencode and Grammar, how do I parse torrent file with raw bytes in it that arent utf8 ? I tried the latin-1 trick but it doesnt seem to solve the issue, it doesnt match anything when I try with latin-1

[11:40] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> the code can be found here: https://raku.land/zef:4zv4l/Bencode / https://github.com/4zv4l/Raku-Bencode

[11:44] *** arkiuat joined
[11:49] *** arkiuat left
[11:59] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> yeah for some reason it reads too much (2 characters too much) when there is the bytes part (trying with Debian torrent netinstall file)

[12:00] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/debian-13.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso.torrent

[12:15] <ab5tract> simon_sibl: Buf and Blob should do the trick

[12:30] *** arkiuat joined
[12:53] <[Coke]> (camelia stickers). I can help with that probably Q1 2025. (where's my UV printer, Bruce!?)

[12:55] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> let me try

[12:55] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> not sure how tho, I do the encoding with latin-1, and I cant give a blob or buf to grammar.parse

[12:57] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> I read the right amount of byte I guess (62640 so cannot count manually but Blob.bytes shows the same amount)

[12:58] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> so I dont understand why it reads a bit too much

[13:13] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> I added the link to the torrent file and to my lib (the lib code isnt necessary here, I took the code for the parser out)

[13:15] <tbrowder> yo, anyone else having a prob with zef not finding recent updated distros?

[17:38] <disbot5> <.landyacht.> Is there any guidance for using NativeCall on Mac? I’m trying to get some code of mine portable, but Mac complains about libcrypto being loaded in an unsafe way. I can solve it by specifying the version the system has installed explicitly (e.g. is native(‘libcrypto.46’)) but that’s obviously not sustainable

[17:40] <disbot5> <.landyacht.> My initial thought is a very early phaser to look in the system libraries path but I don’t know how viable or good that is…

[17:40] <disbot5> <antononcube> @Rog I do all of my Raku-NativeCall project on macOs. See "Math::DistanceFunctions::Edit" or "Math::SparseMatrix::Native" .

[17:41] <disbot5> <.landyacht.> I’ll take a look, thanks

[17:42] <disbot5> <antononcube> I followed the setup (for NativeCall packages) by titsuki and bduggan.

[17:46] <disbot5> <.landyacht.> Oh, is this using your own C code?

[17:48] *** vasko4 left
[17:49] *** vasko45 joined
[17:49] <disbot5> <antononcube> Yes.

[17:51] <disbot5> <.landyacht.> Ah okay, mine is using whatever libcrypto is provided by the system, although maybe I could get around this issue by having my own C layer? Idk how much I like that idea though

[17:52] <disbot5> <antononcube> The "Makefile.in" has to be changed accordingly. I am not sure about the C-libraries inclusions. I think I tried that without success with Apple's "Accelerate".
