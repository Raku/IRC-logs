[11:58] <tbrowder> .seen vrurg

[11:58] <tellable6> tbrowder, I saw vrurg 2025-04-07T13:25:48Z in #raku-dev: <vrurg> nine: wow, that's quite an achievement! 

[12:02] *** apac left
[12:08] *** librasteve joined
[12:11] <tbrowder> has anyone used vrurg's JSON::Class module? i have fiddled with it but the documentation is overwhelming for a mere mortal rakunaut. my simple question is, can i feed it a json file and get back the classes needed to extract the data automagically from any json file with the same format? if much manual intervention is needed, then i can do it myself with not too much pain.

[12:32] <tbrowder> ah, ask ChatGPT to do it for me...

[12:42] *** apac joined
[12:47] <Voldenet> in most languages I use a tool like quicktype.io, but obviously there's no renderer for raku

[12:49] <Voldenet> s/like//

[12:55] <tbrowder> that's ok, ChatGPT has given me the answer! may need some tweaking, but i know why other rakunauts are using it. as my late brother used to say: "cool beans!" (very cool indeed)

[12:56] <tbrowder> i will use that in my FinanceAPI module

[12:56] <Voldenet> btw, if you're using free chatgpt, then consider other models

[12:57] <Voldenet> qwen coder if you want to run it locally, deepseek has better accuracy too

[12:59] <tbrowder> it's doing raku quite nicely for my current needs, but i'll take a look sometime when i get a chance. i assume they all need accounts and passwords...

[12:59] <Voldenet> yep, sadly

[12:59] <Voldenet> well, local doesn't, just needs 24GB of vram :>

[13:00] <tbrowder> i'm comfy with ChatGPT for now

[13:01] <Voldenet> sure, just a suggestion if you hit the wall with chatgpt

[13:01] <tbrowder> actually, my main local box has about 95 Gb ram

[13:01] <Voldenet> it's vram you need though, not ram

[13:01] <tbrowder> oh...

[13:01] <Voldenet> because models run on large number of cuda cores

[13:02] <tbrowder> of course...i forgot...haven't been there since the early days

[13:05] <tbrowder> yes, i stopped paying for expensive graphics cards a long time ago

[13:06] <tbrowder> that seemed to be an exponential cost factor, not to speak of the cooling issue

[13:13] *** apac left
[13:15] *** librasteve left
[13:16] <tbrowder> ah, i did look into the models you suggested some time ago when they were mentioned here...too much trouble for me. but then someone here mentioned chatgpt and i tried it, free account is fine for now, and it'comfy like having a quiet conversation with one's patient and kind college prof

[15:19] <disbot2> <librasteve> I use JSON::Class in the Contact module (https://raku.land/?q=Contact)

[15:49] <Voldenet> >has Str     $.country is required where * eq <USA UK>.any;

[15:49] <Voldenet> Can't Json::Class use enums?

[15:50] <Voldenet> erm, JSON::Class

[15:55] *** apac joined
[16:00] *** librasteve joined
[16:09] <Voldenet> it can, it could be plain enum probably

[16:16] <disbot2> <librasteve> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Contact/issues/3

[16:17] <disbot2> <librasteve> Voldenet: thanks for your review - I have raised an issue and will fix shortly

[16:18] <disbot2> <librasteve> always happy to take a PR !

[16:31] <Voldenet> np, I was actually looking at it to maybe get some tricks for JSON::Class, one can never have too many :)

[16:31] <Voldenet> and with how many features that lib has, I'm sure I know nothing

[16:33] <Voldenet> like for example, if I made an `enum Foo <Bar>`, how would I force it to serialize as lowercase/uppercase

[17:14] <tbrowder> Voldenet: have you ever tried the paid tiers of chatgpt?

[17:16] <Voldenet> Yes, o1 is amazing

[17:17] *** librasteve joined
[17:17] <Voldenet> but it goes through all the tokens so fast, that it isn't reasonably priced atm

[17:22] *** librasteve left
[17:23] *** librasteve joined
[17:23] <Voldenet> free tier of deepseek is not a lot worse, but it's 100% cheaper, so it's fair comparison imo ;)

[17:37] *** Aedil joined
[17:44] <tbrowder> hm, deepseek i think produces better code, and its faster

[17:45] <tbrowder> *it's

[17:46] <tbrowder> and i'm getting better at entering my requests...
