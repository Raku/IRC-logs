[00:41] <Voldenet> using class trait isn't that hard, but I have no idea how to export a sub into caller context

[00:42] <Voldenet> m: multi sub trait_mod:<is> (Mu:U $target, :$subbed!) { say $target.^name; }; class MyPage is subbed { };

[00:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8b15dcc6: OUTPUT: «MyPage␤»

[00:52] <Voldenet> m: my $subs; sub p {}; multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Mu:U $target, :$subbed!) { $subs{$target.^name.lc} = sub (*@a, *%h) { $target.new(|@a, |%h) }; }; class MyPage is subbed { }; say $subs<mypage>()

[00:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8b15dcc6: OUTPUT: «MyPage.new␤»

[03:52] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I've been fiddling with this for a while and I just cannot get anything to work

[03:53] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I was thinking something like GLOBAL::.ASSIGN-KEY(...), but maybe the order in which things happen isn't right for being able to use that in a trait_mod

[03:55] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> also tried adding it to the EXPORT::DEFAULT of the package being is subbed'd but that didn't pan out either

[03:56] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> this is probably easier with RakuAST?

[04:15] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> okay, using the actual Rakudo implemention of is export as a reference, there is a (naughty) way to do it

[13:01] <Voldenet> now that I think of it, C# have recently introduced the nullable reference type, which is a bit like type smileys

[13:02] <Voldenet> in that case, `void X(F? f) {}` accepts both F? (nullable) and F (not nullable)

[13:02] <Voldenet> but `void X(F f) {}` accepts only non-nullable version

[13:03] <Voldenet> (it prints warnings)

[13:03] <Voldenet> so I suppose seeing the use cases for C# reference nullability could be helpful in grasping what it's useful for

[13:04] <Voldenet> however `sub x(F:U $f) {}` is something that doesn't appear in C# at all

[13:05] <Voldenet> probably because there's no type object, because type info is passed through generic invokation parameters

[13:35] <timo> yeah C# shares a single null value like many other languages do, right?

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I think you’ll have to actually import the package containing the subbed class

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I split my code into three files

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> One with the subbed class as a unit class

[17:02] *** jpn left
[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> Another for the trait itself, and then a script to pull in the subbed class and use the constructor sub

[21:18] <SrainUser> How can I match more than one end of line statements in my grammar? Code:

[21:18] <SrainUser> grammar statements {

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	rule TOP {

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	<statement>*

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	}

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	rule statement {

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	"hello" $$

[21:18] <SrainUser> 	}

[21:18] <SrainUser> }

[21:18] <SrainUser> my Str $source = "hello\nhello";

[21:18] <SrainUser> say statements.parse($source)

[21:30] <[Coke]> m: grammar statements { rule TOP { <statement>* }; token statement { 'hello' $$ \s* } }; my Str $source = "hello\nhello"; say statements.parse($source)

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 339ee6494: OUTPUT: «｢hello␤hello｣␤ statement => ｢hello␤｣␤ statement => ｢hello｣␤»

[21:31] <[Coke]> I think the rule's interaction with the \n was getting confused.

[21:31] <[Coke]> making it all explicit with the token was easier for me, anyway.

[21:34] <[Coke]> (note that the newline is in the first capture there, we could tweak that so it isn't captured.

[21:41] <SrainUser> So it matches when there could be whitespace after the end of line?

[21:41] <SrainUser> Like it doesn't recognize $$

[21:42] <SrainUser> How would I not capture newline?

[21:54] *** SrainUser left
[21:56] <[Coke]> I moved the whitespace check up into TOP and said the statements are separated by whitespace - there's more than one way to do it.

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <itsrakanott> Hi guys. Has anybody experienced issue of rakudo not being able to find import modules on windows? It searches exactly where the module resides and still lets out an erroring trace. How is that even possible lol

[23:38] <ugexe> yes, when i was doing something wrong

[23:39] <ugexe> regardless if you want some actual advice you'll want to post a golfed example of your issue, the command you are running, all of the output, and like a file listing of the path your modules are supposed to be

[23:39] <ugexe> also your version of rakudo would be useful to know in case it is the file length issue
