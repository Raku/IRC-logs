[02:47] <japhb> [Coke]: Why are some modules in that Essential-Modules list unmarked while others have git URLs and version tags?

[02:47] <japhb> Also, what is the sorting order for the list, if any?

[02:48] <japhb> [Coke]: Oh wait, were all the ones with git URLs from the Rakudo-Star modules.txt list?

[02:51] <japhb> It seems like since Rakudo-Star is using zef to install everything now, most of the install references should be in the form of fully-specified auth/api/ver strings

[13:34] <disbot3> <itsrakanott> A very niche question: can Raku compile to JS?

[13:36] <patrickb> In theory yes. But the backend is unstable and been unmaintained for quite some years.

[13:38] <disbot3> <itsrakanott> That's a shame. Well, back to HTMX

[14:31] <jdv> who's the sparrow/sparky person again?

[14:32] <lizmat> melezhik

[14:32] <jdv> thanks

[14:32] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: Were the summit recorded? I‚Äôm very interested to know about ‚ÄúQuerying the AST‚Äù‚Ä¶ any information?

[14:33] <jdv> .tell melezhik any idea why this says its passing on your platform?:  https://raku.land/zef:hythm/Pakku

[14:33] <tellable6> jdv, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[14:33] <lizmat> no, there was no recording, it was *waaay* to disorganized for that

[14:34] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: will that be any kind of summarisation shout the topics/discussions or something like that? Sorry, but I‚Äôm really interested‚Ä¶

[14:35] <lizmat> your module was mentioned, as was the whole optimizing the AST (which would be needed for the official 6.e. release)

[14:36] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: I intend to do so...  :-)   in a followup to https://dev.to/lizmat/the-second-raku-core-summit-f99  which was only part 1

[14:36] *** jjido joined
[14:38] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thank you very much! And is there any plan on optimising AST for searching? About my module‚Äôs mention, is there any suggestion for implementing it?

[14:38] <lizmat> no plans that I know of optimizing the AST for searching that I know of, nine?

[14:38] <jdv> what does "optimising AST for searching?" mean?

[14:39] *** melezhik joined
[14:39] <jdv> can't you just walk it?

[14:39] <lizmat> the consensus was that SmokeMachine's module was definitely a source of inspiration

[14:39] <melezhik> –æ/

[14:39] <tellable6> 2025-06-23T13:56:46Z #raku <[Coke]> melezhik - awesome, thanks

[14:39] <tellable6> 2025-06-25T14:33:20Z #raku <jdv> melezhik any idea why this says its passing on your platform?:  https://raku.land/zef:hythm/Pakku

[14:40] *** soverysour left
[14:40] <lizmat> wrt to walking: I think we need a way to: 1.  have an AST be able to replace itself, and b. as soon as a child of an AST is walked, be able to stop walking the other children

[14:40] <lizmat> s/b/2

[14:41] <melezhik> jdv: - it used , now it just shows the cached old results, i need to adjust build abit to make it real

[14:42] <SmokeMachine> jdv: yes you can‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not that easy to match‚Ä¶

[14:42] <melezhik> If this worth of weekly post ? https://github.com/acrion/raku-arch-packager

[14:42] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thanks‚Ä¶ :)

[14:43] <lizmat> melezhik: perhaps with a blog post about it?  :-)

[14:43] <jdv> melezhik: i was just curious if it was gh's problem or your platform's

[14:43] <melezhik> Ah . Ok. Let me actualize the build and we will see 

[14:44] *** librasteve left
[14:45] <jdv> that modules fails to test clean on 2025.03 and 2025.04 for me so far...

[14:50] <melezhik> jdv: sparky build is broken as well - https://sparky.sparrowhub.io/report/hythm7-Pakku/24934 looks like it needs some system packages which are missing on build container

[14:51] <melezhik> jdv: do you maintain Pakku ?

[14:51] <lizmat> Pakky is maintained by hythm

[14:51] <lizmat> *Pakku

[14:56] *** librasteve joined
[14:56] <melezhik> It actually needs libarchive

[14:56] *** yewscion left
[14:57] <melezhik> jdv: ok , let me finish my new setup and I will let you know how this on my end

[14:58] *** wayland76 joined
[14:58] *** wayland left
[14:59] <jdv> it looks like the module is actually broken, at least its tests are.  i'm not terribly concerned cause i don't use it.

[14:59] <jdv> but was just curious about the misleading status thingee

[14:59] <jdv> thanks!

[16:28] <[Coke]> japhb: there is no rhyme to the list at this point. it's inputs from 4 different places with a partial cleanup in progress.

[16:30] <[Coke]> throw any suggestions at the bottom of the page. Eventually this will turn into a data structure in blin I can query

[16:30] <[Coke]> rakudo star had some pinned versions, I started clearing those out.

[16:30] <[Coke]> added jubilatious1_98524's entries.

[19:16] <[Coke]> they were not curated at all, just brain dumps as we went.

[19:16] <[Coke]> One sec.

[19:19] <[Coke]> pinged you the link on irc

[20:33] <disbot3> <librasteve> coming off lizmats weekly, I share the notion that slavenskoj is an AI construct  https://orcid.org/0009-0003-3051-7000 , therefore I request all zef modules by this auth be deleted immediately to avoid dilution of the ecosystem

[21:00] <japhb> [Coke]: Ah nice.  Also nice to see I have a few modules in the list.  :-)

[21:02] <timo> we don't really have a rule against vibe-coded modules on the ecosystem, and i'm not sure there's any requirement for levl of quality for inclusion in the ecosystem, except we maybe throw things out that are clearly malicious, as in literal malware

[21:03] <timo> and we don't have any rules that force someone to use a "legal name" for submissions either

[21:03] <japhb> Might be nice to have a web of trust or other reputational system though.

[21:04] <japhb> So as to avoid people being caught unawares by untrustworthy auth's

[21:09] <timo> are we going to build a CA system? :P

[21:10] <timo> with gpg-style web of trusts, you can always build a swarm of keys that trust each other, and/or clones of existing keys and their relationships with only their IDs being different

[21:11] <timo> without at least one trust anchor, a web of trust system would be useless, especially to someone coming into the whole topic completely fresh

[21:17] <japhb> RSC members could be trust anchors for such a system.

[21:25] *** soverysour left
[21:27] *** librasteve left
[21:38] <timo> seems like an obvious choice. just gotta make sure we don't load too much effort onto them (though with the web they can "just" give an amount of trust to another user who pledges they will review code thoroughly or something like that)

[21:42] *** jjido joined
[21:58] <[Coke]> (untrustworthy auths) esp. since we allow names to be reused.
