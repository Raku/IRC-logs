[19:59] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve it looks like i'm unable to merge, i think someone else may need to hit the merge button

[20:01] <disbot5> <librasteve> lizmat: thanks for reviewing / approving arun's PR - neither of us can see the Merge button, please can you do the honours?

[20:06] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> lizmat: yes thanks for reviewing this as well!

[20:16] <habere-et-disper> How do you dispatch to the same candidate of a multi that you're in? `samewith` will dispatch to whatever matches -- and I want to be specific and override?

[20:38] <habere-et-disper>  Nope -- callsame calls the next matching candidate (per docs).

[20:47] <disbot5> <librasteve> yes, I see - then I don't know, sorry!

[20:47] <disbot5> <nahita3882> &?ROUTINE if i understand correctly

[20:48] <habere-et-disper> Yes -- that worked -- just found it !

[21:44] <[Coke]> trying to verify a windows bug, fired up a new windows box: installed rakubrew. did rakubrew build-zef. I know have a zef... that does nothing. every invocation of zef just returns, no error, no output.

[21:52] <[Coke]> if I run 'raku C:\....zef.raku' it works

[21:56] <disbot5> <librasteve> I wonder if Windows 11 messed with the paths/

[21:56] <disbot5> <librasteve> ?

[21:57] <timo> is it related to runners?

[21:57] <timo> the stuff we compile?

[21:58] <timo> or do we not do that for binaries for packages?

[22:01] <[Coke]> there is a zef.raku and a zef.exe in that directory.

[22:01] <[Coke]> and yes, this is on a windows 11 VM

[22:03] <disbot5> <librasteve> is it rakubrew specific?

[22:04] <disbot5> <librasteve> sorry to ask you to try another installer - I am just thinking maybe an issue to post on rakubrew for Patrick to consider?

[22:06] *** Sgeo joined
[22:06] <[Coke]> I just needed to test https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Pod-To-HTML/issues/100#issuecomment-3568216283 - that module works fine on that windows box, anton

[22:07] <[Coke]> (rakubrew issue) sure, good idea
