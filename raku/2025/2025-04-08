[09:08] <Voldenet> grondilu: because `(state %){$a}{$b} //=` turns the expression into a scalar

[09:09] <Voldenet> m: sub f($a, $b) { (state %){$a}{$b} //= my Num @ = gather { take pi; take e; } }; f("foo", "bar").VAR.WHAT.say

[09:11] <Voldenet> what you could do is

[09:14] <Voldenet> m: use nqp; sub f($a, $b) { nqp::decont (state %){$a}{$b} //= my Num @ = gather { take pi; take e; } }; f("foo", "bar").VAR.WHAT.say

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Let me begin (and welcome you to continue, or just ignore me is fine too). We are on parallel tracks with Cromponent and Air/hArc stack. There has already been some sharing of fundamental ideas ... it was only by reading and building on your early Cromponent design back in Oct/Nov that I was able to understand what I had been aiming for and how to get there. (Which I trust you feel has been properly acknowleged and

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> credited). Even then it was too early for me to be clear about what the goal of Air was - we are both doing something new and for me at least I need to see how the statue emerges from the block of stone. Now that work is done I would say that Air is a quite complete statement of what I see as the best way to build websites. However, Air is not for everyone, Air is very opinionated ... it currently only works with Pico CSS via

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> SASS/SCSS for example, it leans hard on writing html in functional style not with HTML templates, and it is intended to be HTMX above all else, so rather hard to integrate with (eg nodejs). I see that Cromponent is a more broadly capable foundation and I expect that most Cro websites will lean to cro templates (since having HTML monkeys coding templates is a thing for large teams) and that Air will continue to be unusual and

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> pretty niche (I would say better, but that is a marmite opinion).

[09:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Anyway Air is made of three modules (i) Air::Functional is distinct in that is a different way to embed HTML in raku, (ii) Air::Component is an adjusted Cromponent and (iii) Air::Base is a bunch of "standard components" for website builders to extend (site and page are a bit special, but we don't need to worry about that).

[09:24] <Voldenet> m: use nqp; sub f($a, $b) { @:= (state %){$a}{$b} //= my Num @ = gather { take pi; take e; } }; f("foo", "bar").VAR.WHAT.say # this sorta works, but I don't like it

[09:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf8c5ef25: OUTPUT: «(Array[Num])␤»

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> So, my worry is that we will work away separately and diminish our efforts - I propose we try and find a way to collaborate (and invite others to the party). To do this, I think that we could (a) recombine Cromponent and Air::Component into the same codeline (maybe with a shim layer) and (b) do that in a way that makes Cromponents (written with Cro template) and Air::Components (written with Air::Functional)

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> interchangeable. This will help build the overall library of web components available to raku Cro users.

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> What do you think?

[09:41] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I’m in a week of all day presentations, I’ll answer you soon (sorry)

[09:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: there is no hurry ... I'll open an issue at discuss so we do not lose track of the conversation

[11:54] <tbrowder> i haven't found anything in docs about a delay...

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: maybe something like this (untested) https://chatgpt.com/share/67f50eb7-7064-8009-8ccc-a1cb4c08792f

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> looks lke ChatGPT forgot about the raku prompt command so that should simplify this a bit

[17:50] <Voldenet> timo: this is a nice post, but `map` example could be more `for loop`ish via `.map: { … }` perhaps

[17:51] <Voldenet> it could be deceptively similar, even

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Voldenet: nano++ )

[18:51] <[Coke]> is there some raku code to diagnose *where* in a file the malformed UTF-8 it's complaining about is?

[18:51] <[Coke]> (windows)

[18:53] <Voldenet> Yeah, I don't like .map: {} either, it would only look cool in this specific case

[18:53] <timo> what exact error are you getting, [Coke]?

[18:54] <[Coke]> Malformed UTF-8 - turns out it was a leading FFEE.

[18:55] <[Coke]> ... which I could only see using 'format-hex' - tried to manually edit it using vim -b, no love.

[18:56] <timo> huh that's not the BOM, is it? FFEE?

[18:56] <Voldenet> BOM would be \x{EF}\x{BB}\x{BF}

[18:56] <[Coke]> weirdly, I can no longer duplicate this issue - cut and paste some markdown into a temp file to run a raku script on it... for weeks it has been throwing that error (I do this maybe 2x a week). Just now, when I did the cut and paste again... no issue. no FFEE... wtf.

[18:57] <Voldenet> FEFF/FFFE are for utf16/32

[18:57] <timo> might depend on what program you're saving it with, or something?

[18:58] <timo> m: say Buf.new(0xFF, 0xEE, 0x3a).decode

[18:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 211641a42: OUTPUT: «Malformed UTF-8 at line 1 col 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:58] <[Coke]> sorry, FFFE

[18:59] <timo> i guess we could put a special case for this funny special case

[18:59] <timo> but you didn't get the line/col output?

[18:59] <[Coke]> of the input? no, backtrace into the setting, IIRC

[19:08] <timo> it has to be the decodestream code, not the non-streaming utf8 decoder

[20:21] <timo> presumably just windows's own copilot stuff?

[22:17] <Xliff> I'm writing an application-server in Raku and would like to include some basic Red support.

[22:18] <Xliff> How can I associate a DBIish or DBI database connection with Red?

[22:18] <[Coke]> I can't imagine we would release it as the default without a full month of testing.

[22:19] <Xliff> For technical reasons (database pools) I can't use 'red-default' so I'm hoping there's another way.

[22:19] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: `database` can receive a DBI object… depending on the Red driver…
