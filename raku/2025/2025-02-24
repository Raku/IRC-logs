[06:48] <patrickb> melezhik: Currently there are no binaries for arm. I'd welcome us having those, but it just didn't happen yet. The biggest issue being the research and decision which architecture/os/toolchain/libc combinations we want.

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> guess it's me triggering something when I go m: from the Discord side

[13:58] <lizmat> the trigger is: camelia not reacting

[13:59] <lizmat> and camelia doesn't understand m: from the bridge, because they all start with <foo> instead of m:

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> camelia being the log scraper?

[14:52] *** Guest72 left
[14:54] <patrickb> I am currently using vim on Powershell. But I think I didn't do c'n'p up until now.

[14:54] <tellable6> 2025-02-24T09:29:23Z #raku <melezhik> patrickb:  I see, I actually build Rakudo form ARM from time to time for myself to use it for sparky.sparrowhub.io 

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat It looks like emoji synonyms addition in "Text::Emoji" is supported by %additional argument. Should there be an easy extension to use the tags of "emojis.json"? For example, "Spock" and "prosper" are tags for "Vulcan salute", but to-emoji(":spock:") is not reacted upon.

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, I can use raw-emoji-data to make the additional argument, but since "Text::Emoji" knows the tags it seems a little "too much work."

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Generally, speaking there should some sort of recommender system for emojis. (Not "just" using LLMs.)

[15:13] <liztormato> Antononcube I guess putting a Map::Match on top of all the words

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> fwiw I imagine hooking up an LLM with Text::Emoji would be interesting -- maybe with a command llem

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> use an LLM prompt to constrain the answer to the target emoji set and allow any words to be the LLM query
