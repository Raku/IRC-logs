[09:38] <timo> we should really, really find something for LibraryMake (and related things) that doesn't rely on $*VM.config

[09:38] <timo> ... maybe without reimplementing automake ourselves poorly

[09:40] <timo> the flags used to build moarvm, like optimization flags, warning and error flags, used C standard, etc are not relevant to building native code modules

[09:42] <timo> oh, that's what patrickb just posted about

[11:29] <notable6> lizmat, Noted! (weekly)

[13:26] <Voldenet> no wonder, raku is ideal for tools like this

[13:27] <Voldenet> one really gains appreciation for raku's MAIN and `run` once they try doing this in any other language

[13:29] <timo> it'd be cool if the post-processing at the end were a bit more sophisticated? if that even makes any sense at all

[13:30] <Voldenet> I can understand, I have functions like that too

[13:30] <Voldenet> it's not ideal, but it's fast enough

[13:31] <timo> if your input is controlled enough, you can get away with a cascade of regex substitution statements

[18:31] <arkiuat> so I'm working on docs, but camelia isn't over on #raku-doc, so...

[18:31] <arkiuat> m: for &deepmap, &reduce { say .signature }

[18:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «($, $, *%)␤($, |)␤»

[18:32] *** swaggboi joined
[18:32] <timo> i think camelia might answer private messages too?

[18:32] <arkiuat> the sub (rather than method) version of deepmap isn't actually currently documented.  The sub version of reduce is documented, but the doc shows a fuller signature than what camelia just said

[18:32] <arkiuat> timo: this is for purpose of demonstration

[18:33] <arkiuat> The doc shows reduce's signature as: multi        reduce (&with, +list)

[18:34] <arkiuat> so I was just wondering if there is anywhere I could find a reasonable way to flesh out deepmap's signature while documenting it, the way reduce's is.

[18:34] <arkiuat> duckmap and nodemap are in the same situation as deepmap, so I'm doing all three at the same time. They show identical signatures.

[18:37] <timo> ah right, i like camelia for demonstration purposes as well

[18:38] <arkiuat> the method version of reduce has &with as well in one of the two candidates, and the three -map subs have &block, so that names the first $ in the signature, but I'm still a little mystified as to how to show the second $.

[18:39] <arkiuat> The *% is presumably just for adverbs?

[18:39] <timo> m: for &deepmap.candidates { .signature.say }

[18:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «(&op, \obj)␤»

[18:39] <timo> m: for &reduce.candidates { .signature.say }

[18:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «(&with, +list)␤»

[18:39] <arkiuat> oh, hey, there's a gist!

[18:40] <arkiuat> thank you!

[18:40] <arkiuat> I was just phrasing my "say" wrong, huh.

[18:42] <timo> i think the difference was that you were just getting the signature of the proto and i was reaching into it to get candidate sub signatures

[18:43] <arkiuat> ah, that makes sense

[18:45] <arkiuat> I didn't do that because &deepmap only has one candidate, but now I see that was a mistake

[18:46] <arkiuat> even with only one candidate, the proto is still distinct

[18:50] <timo> indeed
