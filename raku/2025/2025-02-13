[08:13] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> SmokeMachine: I guess you try to build framework for EDA?

[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Raku framework

[08:20] <SmokeMachine> sorry, EDA?

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yeah - event driven architecture

[08:36] <SmokeMachine> ah! ok, sorry... yes... that's the idea!

[08:37] <SmokeMachine> did you have the chance to take a look? it's still at the very baginning...

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yeah . I looked briefly. Without digging into. I‚Äôd recommend to postulate the main idea In the beginning of Readme. Something like - Sourcing - Raku based framework for EDA and distributed systems . It implements following architecture patterns - ERA, Saga, CQRS . And would give it a reference to the mentioned patterns docs/wiki page. It would help unprepared users to get the context first )) But overall it looks

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> great üëç

[08:47] *** peder_ left
[08:47] <SmokeMachine> that's a very good suggestion! Thanks!

[23:44] <Xliff> Hello.

[23:45] <Xliff> How can I MUTE the "Use of uninitialized value" warnings?

[23:50] <lizmat> m: my $a; say $a ~ "foo"

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac06359c4: OUTPUT: ¬´Use of uninitialized value element of type Any in string context.‚ê§Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.‚ê§foo‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§¬ª

[23:50] <lizmat> m: my $a; quietly say $a ~ "foo"

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac06359c4: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[23:51] <lizmat> alternately:

[23:51] <lizmat> m: CONTROL { .resume }; my $a; say $a ~ "foo"

[23:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac06359c4: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª

[23:51] <lizmat> possibly check for type of exception

[23:52] <lizmat> m: CONTROL { .resume if $_ ~~ CX::Warn }; my $a; say $a ~ "foo"

[23:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac06359c4: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§¬ª
