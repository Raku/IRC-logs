[17:52] <disbot6> <antononcube> @ab5tract What is the andthen/orelse patch?

[17:59] <ab5tract> antononcube: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5917

[18:04] *** melezhik left
[18:05] <Voldenet> ab5tract: after pondering a bit about it I'd completely ditch :$synchronous as there is hardly any profit from it apart from added complexity

[18:06] <Voldenet> especially when awaitable result is used

[18:07] <Voldenet> > .andthen({ .foo }).orelse({ .bar }, :synchronous)

[18:07] <Voldenet> is mostly equivalent to

[18:07] <Voldenet> > .andthen({ .foo }).orelse({ .bar }).&await

[18:08] <Voldenet> and without the synchronous flag the code would be pleasant to look at

[18:08] <ab5tract> ok I see your point. but :synchronous predates this patch, so it also makes some sense to account for it, no?

[18:08] <ab5tract> or does the new andthen/orelse make it gratuitous?

[18:12] <Voldenet> I'm not actually sure what was the point of original :synchronous, because it wasn't specified anywhere

[18:12] <Voldenet> maybe it was performance thing, maybe it was convenience thing

[18:13] <Voldenet> (well, both .andthen and .orelse were not specified before, so I'm fairly sure it's all made for convenience)

[18:14] <ab5tract> ok, then I guess killing :synchronous is fine

[18:15] <Voldenet> maybe promise should have rust-esque .await method for convenience

[18:15] *** melezhik_ joined
[18:15] <Voldenet> though &await is fairly close enough

[18:17] <ab5tract> well, we mirror methods and subs all the time, so I guess that's not such an outlandish request in this context :)

[18:19] <ab5tract> my very brutish, extremely slow solution to AoC day2 pt2 = https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/f8acb0519396c763c854727d8525b7be

[18:21] <ab5tract> "what do you mean that three nested loops isn't efficient?"

[18:23] <ab5tract> Voldenet: thanks for the feedback, I'll ping again once some changes are made

[18:46] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> I'm actually rewriting it to have a more Raku-like syntax

[18:48] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> it used to look something like my $response = patch-elements("<div></div>", :as-supply, :selector<#id>) but now it will look like this: datastar { patch-elements "<div></div>", :selector<#id> }

[19:36] <disbot6> <antononcube> "Markdown::Grammar" can do conversions to Pod6 and HTML.

[19:38] <disbot6> <antononcube> Mmm.. you asking from rakudoc to HTML. (I thought you are asking to rakudoc.)

[19:56] <disbot6> <librasteve> there have been a couple of historic attempts to automate md or rakudoc conversion to the wordpress site - these have been both awkward to use and unreliable (eg one writes your raku code to a GH gist and then screen scrapes back the highlighted raku code) ... I have done a push to simplify this operationally (just write it in wordpress!) and programatically since wordpress does not support Raku code highlighting (use

[19:56] <disbot6> Hilite::Simple)

[19:57] <disbot6> <librasteve> this is set out here https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

[19:59] <disbot6> <librasteve> there are always folk happy to help ... and certainly we will take md or html and post it on wordpress if you prefer ... in that case, make a PR with  your post in the /articles folder https://github.com/Raku/advent/tree/main/raku-advent-2025/articles

[19:59] <disbot6> <librasteve> really appreciate all the contributions ... keep em coming!!
