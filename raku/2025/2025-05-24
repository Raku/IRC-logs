[00:24] <wayland> If zef says a package is installed, but when I "use" it I get: Could not find <module> then are there any thoughts as to what it might be?  Specifically, the module contains only a role, not a class, and I'm using rakubrew.

[03:36] <wayland> Also, do we have a method that gets called when a role is composed into a class?

[03:45] <Guest72> there's the COMPOSE phaser, though I don't know how implemented it is or not. might be a better way to do it

[03:48] *** kylese joined

[04:18] <wayland> I saw that; might be useful.  I actually want to trigger something at TWEAK time, I think.  

[04:25] <wayland> (I ignored it because it said it wasn't implemented)

[04:28] <Guest72> just curious, what are you trying to accomplish?

[04:54] <Xliff> wayland: If you are able to get a quick demo working, I'd appreciate a look at it. I'm also thinking about using it for a project.

[05:43] <wayland> Xliff: I can do you one better (or worse :p ).  There's already an example at https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/blob/main/examples/form.raku .  I probably won't get onto this for another week or two, so that's probably your best option in the short term.  

[05:45] <wayland> m: role roleA { submethod TWEAK() { say "Role TWEAK for {self.^name}"; } }; class B does roleA { submethod TWEAK() { say "B TWEAK"; } }; class C does roleA {}; my $a = roleA.new(); my $b = B.new(); my $c = C.new();

[05:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar b29ab0f52: OUTPUT: «Role TWEAK for roleA␤B TWEAK␤Role TWEAK for C␤»

[05:46] <wayland> Interesting; with "but" it runs both TWEAKs, but with "does", it doesn't.  

[05:47] <Voldenet> hm, https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/blob/main/examples/form.raku totally doesn't work for me

[05:49] *** wayland left
[05:52] <Voldenet> or rather, it does render some boxes, but then every single example stops responding

[05:57] *** yewscion joined
[05:58] <Xliff> wayland: Yes, my take on that is that when you use "does", all methods are composed at the same time... even with submethods.

[05:58] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to wayland

[05:58] *** wayland76 joined
[05:59] <Xliff> Voldenet: Yeah, I'm trying to use the lower level interface (IE, without the "with $builder" block) and it's giving me other errors.

[06:00] <Voldenet> I take back "not responding", it does respond to SIGWINCH and resizes boxes

[06:00] <Voldenet> but so the main loop is very likely working fine

[06:00] <wayland76> Well, maybe I'll be making some PRs, then, but not for another few weeks, I think.  

[06:00] <tellable6> 2025-05-24T05:58:15Z #raku <Xliff> wayland: Yes, my take on that is that when you use "does", all methods are composed at the same time... even with submethods.

[06:01] <Voldenet> I'm betting that I get the same errors, just they don't get printed anywhere

[16:29] <[Coke]> Yes.

[16:29] <[Coke]> To address this ticket:

[16:29] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5864

[16:29] <[Coke]> That commit was re-merged just after the latest release, but I don't think any of the underlying issues were addressed.

[16:30] <[Coke]> rakudo head now has that updated version of mimalloc again

[16:34] <disbot1> <melezhik.> Ok. I see. I need to tweak my sparky build to allow build from head , it used to be , but things changed

[16:45] <disbot1> <melezhik.> The build script is in here - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melezhik/ci.sparrowhub/refs/heads/master/projects/rakudo-head/files/Dockerfiles/install-rakudo-sha.sh
