[12:10] <demostanis_> hello

[12:10] <demostanis_> say [+] map {[[&(::("&infix:<$(@_[*-1])>"))]] @_[0..*-2]},[Z] "input.txt".IO.lines>>.words;

[12:10] <demostanis_> does anyone know how to shorten this even further? that's AOC's day 6

[14:07] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve do you want me to schedule the article or no

[14:10] <disbot6> <librasteve> that's fine - I can take it from here - much appreciate the contribution!

[14:11] <disbot6> <librasteve> i have a question about datastar (and maybe HTMX 4) - in the current HARC stack, the Counter example looks like this https://harcstack.org

[14:11] <disbot6> <librasteve> however, I recently saw this example in JSX (which I guess lives in React land)...

[14:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1447229378340851733/Screenshot_2025-12-07_at_14.12.36.png?ex=6936dce4&is=69358b64&hm=49e7e5e96970b4faa5fa8753091c77662f86b90e7fc181635e9e23cee5d0972b&

[14:13] <disbot6> <librasteve> my question is how to adjust HARC stack so that Components can be more like the JSX example - can datastar do this?

[15:34] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve it's a bit more complicated than I would imagine, to my understanding the Racket web server framework and Seaside in the Smalltalk achieve this with continuations

[15:35] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> That example works in JS because the state that's being store is only being modified in component and we don't have to worry about other parties trying to change the data

[16:13] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> I have a couple of ideas if you're ever down to hop on a call

[17:01] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve i have one question: what exactly does the sub respond do?

[17:01] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> in the example

[17:10] <disbot6> <librasteve> can't see respond in that example, but irrc it is a way to go =item C<method toggle> adjusts the state and ends with the C<respond> sub (which calls C<.HTML>) ... this became redundant since self.Str now calls self.HTML

[18:03] *** melezhik joined
[18:49] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> I think I asked this earlier but is there only one instance of a component registered for an app?

[18:49] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> Like when you register the component in Cro does it instantiate a component per connection?

[19:05] *** korvo joined
[19:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> no problem to ask twice :-) … so Air::Component does three main things when you go class MyThing does Component {} - assign a unique serial number to each object, tells Cro to make a route for each method marked  is controller and call the method on the particular object when that route is hit passing in the arms

[19:15] <disbot6> <librasteve> in Wordpress each object has a canonical name based on post id - so there is a huge posts table :: in Air each object has a canonical name made of class name-serial

[19:42] <disbot6> <librasteve> to answer your question, you need to pass either the type class MyThing or just one instance of MyThing as an arg to site … like site(:register(MyThing, …)).serve

[20:10] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> So the idea that I had was that for each client that sends a request to the page that renders the component  an object would be instantiated and there would be a random string ID for that object, that way the state of that component would remain encapsulated, which is what it looks you're doing

[20:12] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> Datastar in addition to handling SSE, also lets you send a JSON response back which it patches into the signals that it sets up on the client side

[20:13] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> So you could simply return JSON back instead of returning HTML if you want

[20:13] *** melezhik left
[20:13] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> You can also return Javascript to execute on the client side if you want

[20:32] <disbot6> <librasteve> thanks for the explanation… not quite right in that Air does not track client or session state … all Air::Component instances are prebuilt on the server (like all wordpress posts are in the db) … the serial id is so that you can have multiple copies of a component (eg several nav bars)

[20:33] <disbot6> <librasteve> several tables, several forms and so on

[20:35] *** tgt left
[20:38] <disbot6> <librasteve> I see that you would need this in the event you want the server to store each client state … i cannot see that this would be a good direction for Air, except that you would want some kind of cookie / local state stored on client (eg for login status or other session storage) … so in the counter example, i think that there’s a count value per browser in the JSX, but in Air, the count value is intended to be a shared

[20:38] <disbot6> global value

[20:39] <disbot6> <librasteve> food for thought - thanks!
