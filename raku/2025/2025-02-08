[04:05] <Xliff> Does anyone know if Cro caches, or if there has been a caching module developed for it?

[13:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I don't know -- here is what Google's Gemini thinks:

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> This http caching . Cro by could send http caching headers . So if question about http caching in that context - then answer is yes. Caching thing in general - more broad topic usually mentioned in high load systems as a mechanism to couple with higher load requests

[13:38] <tellable6> 2025-02-07T10:47:34Z #raku <librasteve> melezhik: thanks ... will take a look

[13:40] <lizmat> it's been a few years since I looked at the code of the IRC logs website

[13:40] <lizmat> but I think it does caching there

[13:40] <lizmat> for the date page files (if not on today)

[13:41] *** apac joined
[13:41] <lizmat> but I think I implemented that by looking at: is there a file with this name and its modified date is after server startup, then slurp the file and give that

[13:42] <lizmat> sadly no support for SendFile (at least at the time I wrote that

[13:42] <lizmat> )

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Repeating my answer as irc log only keep initial answer , not later revisions done in discord … important details are missed   This is a http caching . Cro as a web server  could send http caching headers to inform browsers about static resources expiration date so they won’t overload web server requests and only request a new version of resource due expiration deadline, meanwhile using their local cache . So if

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> question about http caching in that context - then answer is yes. Caching thing in general - more broad topic usually mentioned in high load systems as a mechanism to couple with higher load requests

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: here's what I found out from the docs

[17:56] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: (i) https://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-http-router#Setting_response_cachability - so Cro::HTTP::Router gives you power over the HTTP cache-control headers (but then the cache is implemented in the browser - or somewhere in a web cache internet (as you probably know)

[17:57] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: (ii) http://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-http-middleware#Middleware_involving_both_requests_and_responses describes (with an example) of how to roll your own Cro middleware cache

[17:59] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: (iii) Cro::WebApp::Templates are held in a repository and are precompiled and cached when the server is started.

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Xliff: while this module https://raku.land/github:scmorrison/Web::Cache was built for Bailador, it would probably be quite easy to cut and shunt this together with the Cro middleware example

[18:38] <Guest37> I'm watching the Bruce Gray intro to raku .. haven't used perl in a long time and never was a wizard

[18:39] *** yewscion joined
[18:42] <Guest37> i committed to put 3-4 hours into raku today to hopefully get excited about it

[18:43] <lizmat> well, if you have questions, Guest37, then you could also try asking here on on #raku-beginner

[18:44] <Guest37> Thank you

[18:45] *** ulipink left
[18:45] *** yewscion left
[18:45] <lizmat> Guest37: also, if you're coming from Perl, then you might find this interesting: https://dev.to/lizmat/migrating-perl-to-raku-1c47

[18:47] <Guest37> My perl was in 2008 and never fully learned it. Coming most recently from Python and C++

[18:47] <Guest37> Those are ones I know the best

[18:48] <lizmat> then perhaps: https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell

[18:49] <lizmat> we don't have one coming form C++  or C for that matter  :-(

[18:49] <Guest37> That python one should be very helpful

[18:52] <lizmat> I hope it will...  if you have any suggestions to improve that nutshell, please leave a comment / make an issue  :)

[18:53] <Guest37> I will for sure
