[07:13] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Voldenet I don't see how you can .andthen anything because andthen creates a local $_ , which is useful when you're juggling two variables.

[07:15] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my $a = "cat"; my $b = 3; $a.chars eq $b andthen say "$a is $b characters is $_";

[07:17] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524>  raku -e 'my $a = "cat"; my $b = 3;  $a.chars eq $b andthen say "$a is $b characters is $_";' cat is 3 characters is True

[13:52] <lizmat> on a non-iterable value, it just creates an empty Seq   antononcube

[14:00] <lizmat> fwiw, I would have written adjacent-difference as:  self Z- self.skip

[14:01] <lizmat> or: $_ Z- .skip with self

[14:01] <lizmat> or: $_ Z- .skip given self

[14:02] <lizmat> but yeah: .skip is an easy way to skip the first element of an Iterable

[14:09] <disbot6> <rcmlz> I was watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvFTyvYM-ds and wondering how I could use the tricks shown such that I can re-use it easily, because I keep forgetting all the nifty tricks quite quickly

[14:10] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Collecting them in a Role seemed a valid option …

[14:13] <disbot6> <rcmlz> and looks much better when used in a chained method call on the array compared to .&{}

[15:19] <disbot6> <librasteve> hi, I am wrestling with a Cro route - have this https://gist.github.com/librasteve/870ce7d9196a02d6723ff47943e0c826 in a route block but it only works when my list of @redirects has one elem ... I suspect that this is due to me overloading the same signature ... if I had literals in the get signature, then would work fine ... is there a practicak way to do this?

[15:19] <disbot6> <librasteve> sorry - back in 40 mins

[15:45] *** arkiuat joined
[15:51] <Voldenet> librasteve: no need to complicate it: `get -> $old, *@drop { redirect $new }` would work

[15:53] <Voldenet> nevermind

[15:53] <Voldenet> it doesn't work

[15:54] *** arkiuat left
[15:56] <ab5tract> does using a named subset change anything?

[15:56] <ab5tract> ah, but that's not simple to with @redirects

[15:58] *** arkiuat joined
[16:00] <Voldenet> I got fooled by it appearing to work, but the redirect was totally wrong

[16:01] <ab5tract> what if the redirects are stored in a hash and looked up via $old ?

[16:02] <ab5tract> I guess the issue is that the signature is too ambiguous

[16:03] <ab5tract> so that wouldn't help much

[16:10] <Voldenet> well `before { %redirects{.path} andthen redirect $_ }` is an option I think

[16:35] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: thanks … yes i have been fooled a couple of time seems that the route{} block is unhappy with many similar signatures … one time i had two routes working but they both redirect to the first value of $new

[16:36] <disbot6> <librasteve> i don’t quite understand your before idea … can you maybe do a bigger example?

[16:39] <Voldenet> > my %redirects = ['/community' => '/nav/1/community', …]; my $application = route { before { %redirects{.path} andthen redirect $_ }; …

[16:40] <Voldenet> downside is that it'd execute all matching middlewares later I think

[16:40] <Voldenet> other option

[16:40] <Voldenet> > delegate "$old" => route { get -> { say "$old $new"; redirect $new } };

[16:41] <Voldenet> it does sub-routing for the path

[16:43] <Voldenet> I'm not sure which of these is better option

[16:44] <Voldenet> I wish you could do `get -> "/$old"` but obviously that won't work trivially, some ast/eval magic would need to be there

[16:46] <disbot6> <librasteve> is delegate documented anywhere? I havent got a clue what is it doing but it seems to do the trick

[16:49] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh I found it https://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-http-router#Delegating_routes_to_another_Cro::Transform

[16:51] *** melezhik joined
[16:52] <disbot6> <librasteve> omg that's a cool trick!

[17:50] *** dakkar left
[18:03] *** melezhik_ joined
[18:07] *** melezhik_ left
[18:49] <Voldenet> btw, route is quite wasteful Cro::Transform, because it always does routing underneath (checks path-matcher etc.)

[18:53] <Voldenet> so actual delegate can use somewhat easier code for redirects, that doesn't check anything and always returns redirect https://0x0.st/KyYe.raku

[21:20] <Voldenet> no uuid lib is great though, they get higher collision chance over time

[21:21] *** Aedil left
[21:23] *** arkiuat joined
[21:23] <Voldenet> uuid should not be entirely random, because this requires very high quality randomness

[21:24] <Voldenet> usual algorithms use randomness, but also include timestamp as part of guid

[21:27] <Voldenet> there are things like uuidd (which is a daemon app for generating guids) or libuuid (which uses high-quality randomness or if it's not present uses timestamp, mac address and some low-quality randomness)

[21:28] *** arkiuat left
[21:34] <Voldenet> other approaches use md5(as many unique things as possible)

[21:34] <Voldenet> huh there's even rfc with it https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122
