[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: as you can see, I have acknowledged that part of the Air library is based on your (early) Cromponent module - this was a big help and inspiration to Air

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: please let me know if you are happy with the wording of the acknowledgement (I do not want you to have to be responsible for maintenance of course)
