[03:02] <Xliff> Good evening!

[03:02] <tellable6> 2025-04-09T00:25:00Z #raku <SmokeMachine> Xliff There are 2 examples of drivers on Red: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Driver/Pg.rakumod and https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Driver/SQLite.rakumod

[03:02] <tellable6> 2025-04-09T00:29:08Z #raku <SmokeMachine> Xliff but basically, the main method that needs to be implemented it the `translate` one. But itâ€™s implemented on CommonSQL driver.

[03:03] <Xliff> .tell SmokeMachine Yes, but translate is a mouthful, given the number of nodes it has to cover. I'll see if there are any not covered by the existing alpha MySQL driver.

[03:03] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to SmokeMachine

[03:04] <Xliff> Can someone tell me how I can list the defined classes available to a scope at run-time?

[06:56] <wayland76> Hi all!  I have a question about Slangs.  I thought it was a bit lengthy for the channel, so I've pasted it at https://gist.github.com/wayland/a3063994fc3ddf415de243389a4f47f5

[11:49] <tbrowder> a note on hanging procs: looking at man pages  for linux 'posix_spawn' and 'wait*', a raku module should be able to handle them--an exercise for  antononcube and chat gpt

[12:17] <tbrowder> whoa!! i just tried chatgpt on that subject and got a decent looking program!!!

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tbrowder Yes, of course. Now the "hard" question -- did you use Raku for that?

[12:26] <tbrowder> yes, i just got my solution. glad i'm not working, chatgpt would be a big threat!

[12:27] <tbrowder> but i guess someone has to qc its output, at least for now...

[12:29] <tbrowder> oh, no, i misstated. i typed in the query in the chat box asking for the solution for linux using raku

[12:39] <tbrowder> i'm going to try the responses today and see if i can solve the hangin proc. chatgpt's solution looks very similar to ugexe's but with some easier-to-grok structured code.

[12:40] <tbrowder> if i get it working i'll gist it here.

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good luck!

[12:45] <tbrowder> thnx

[23:07] <wayland> In grammars, is there a way to return an additional piece of information other than just the Match?  Can I just create a new attribute on the Match object, or do I need to use augment for that?

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can use actions. In a separate class or built-in the grammar.
