[15:32] <[Coke]> TIL you can use sort inbuilt to vim instead of shelling out

[15:32] <[Coke]> :%sort vs. :%!sort

[15:32] <[Coke]> (helpful when using vim in powershell)

[19:09] <disbot4> <librasteve> did you read the manual?

[19:09] <disbot4> <librasteve> (I suspect that vim & raku share some DNA)

[19:10] *** stanrifkin joined
[19:10] <disbot4> <librasteve> '^', '$' for example

[19:12] *** librasteve_ joined
[19:20] <[Coke]> The manual is enormous, so I don't anymore, no. I only found that out today because I couldn't shell out and figured "there has to be SOMETHING" builtin.

[19:20] <[Coke]> I know just enough to be just productive enough that it's not worth reading. :)

[19:20] <disbot4> <librasteve> (there' likely a vim newsletter - lol)

[19:21] <disbot4> <librasteve> me I m stuck at fghj since 1985

[22:03] <wayland> librasteve_: That's shared regex has gotta be either early regex, or the editor "ed" :).  Not sure which came first though.
