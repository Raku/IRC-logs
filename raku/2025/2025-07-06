[13:32] <apogee_ntv> So I installed mi6, I made a new project with it. I can see that it put pod docs in lib/My/Module.rakumod. Do I need to do anything special to configure it to get readme from doc/?

[13:33] <lizmat> dist.ini

[13:33] <lizmat> [ReadmeFromPod]

[13:33] <lizmat> filename = doc/foo...

[13:35] <apogee_ntv> Thanks!

[13:35] <apogee_ntv> I just saw dist.ini when I opened telescope :D

[13:38] <apogee_ntv> lizmat: If you get a chance could you take another look at my Image::PNG::Portable PR? I think I addressed everything.

[13:38] <lizmat> will do

[23:57] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I was reading Ait::Component’s Red and just realised I didn’t let you know that there is a new merge on that, adding a few tests and changing some internal code… now it’s possible to have a LOAD with more than one parameter (that’s what I remembered reading your code…)

[23:57] <tellable6> SmokeMachine, I'll pass your message to librasteve_
