[03:02] <Guest23> 8-27-25 Windows 10 ;  rakudo (moar AND star) installed.  My anti-virus program, Bitdefender, notified me that program perl6w-m.exe was infected with Gen.Variant.Tedy.814788, and removed it.  Rakudo re-installed (in another location);  this time, Bitdefender was told to keep it.  This message is to notify any/all of the virus, and to ask why

[03:02] <Guest23> the program perl6w-m.exe is protected. e.g., can't rename or delete it.  I'm a former COBOL programmer (and a good one) who has kept up with a variety of programming languages;  I'll be 90 years old next

[03:57] <Voldenet> that seems like false positive in bit defender, similar things happen a lot

[18:50] <disbot8> <librasteve> Guest23: welcome and kudos ... I have been toying with ChatGPT (re)writing some of the X => Raku language migration guides ... would be interesting to know what bits of COBOL are missing from Raku

[18:51] <disbot8> <librasteve> btw I find some kind of Unix very helpful with Raku ... perhaps you could install WSL?

[19:05] <[Coke]> I've been using it on powershell, seems to behave OK

[19:05] <[Coke]> Historically have used 'git bash' (esp. since I needed git anyway)
