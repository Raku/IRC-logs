[08:39] <disbot5> <librasteve> [Coke]++ on this … while I’m a bit anti LLM slop, I did try to feed in one of these with gaps and Chat-jippity did a great draft of the missing parts (the Haskell one, I think) …

[09:24] <[Coke]> ... Do you know enough haskell to verify that?

[09:25] <[Coke]> That's the problem - I might trust it with the prose, because I can *fix* the prose in an edit pass, probably. I can't do the same for haskell/python/ruby...

[09:25] <[Coke]> ... I need to stop volunteering to do things that start so early.

[09:25] * [Coke] heads out.

[11:37] <disbot5> <librasteve> [Coke] ... this is my concern - takes a real expert in the other language to tame the LLM ... I could maybe do PHP (but that would mean a new language guide) ... or vanilla JS, but i have never done TS so that's gonna be quite poor for the modern era...

[18:45] <[Coke]> template? nope, just a few examples.

[18:45] <[Coke]> Getting a "how to guide" for other languages might also be good.
