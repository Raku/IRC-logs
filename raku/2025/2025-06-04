[05:53] <Voldenet> Guest98: don't be so hard on github, most companies scrap code without even telling you, I doubt there's place in the Internet that isn't feeding some AI :\

[07:11] <refactus> I finally picked a nick. No, codeberg and sourcehut among others do not do that. And that's only one of several concerns I have about github since MS acquired it. If you actually read the privacy and terms pages on these sites, you'll see the difference. I vote with my engagement and data. Microsoft does not get my vote, especially given so many other anti-competition, anti-linux, anti-oss aspects of

[07:11] <refactus> their history. As far as I'm concerned, them buying github was a hostile takeover just like freenode.

[07:13] <refactus> different organizations are different. in sourcehut's case, read https://sourcehut.org/blog/2025-04-15-you-cannot-have-our-users-data/ and https://sourcehut.org/blog/2025-05-29-whats-cooking-q2/

[07:21] <refactus> for codeberg there's a mention of fighting scrapers under "AI and Crawling" on https://blog.codeberg.org/letter-from-codeberg-software-is-about-humans.html and they even mention concerns about the environmental and social aspect. in the middle of their homepage header area they put "Codeberg is a non-profit, community-led effort". members, who pay a tiny yearly due to keep the thing running, actually

[07:21] <refactus> get to vote, that's how the whole thing is ran. *nothing* like github

[07:21] <refactus> those are the kinds of things I want to support. not microsoft.

[07:26] <refactus> the reason enshitification works is because people don't care enough about principles to cut loose the things that become bad, they just turn a blind eye and put up with it

[07:31] <refactus> so I consider it not just my right but my civic *duty* to be hard on github. if y'all weren't still using it, I'd probably already be contributing again. another project using github asked me for a contribution a day or two ago, and I told them the're going to get it by e-mail

[07:32] <refactus> anyway, I'll stop banging that drum if nobody brings it up again, but don't try to tell me they're all the same and nothing matters. that attitude is the real core problem as far as I'm concerned

[07:44] <refactus> darn, I was almost tired enough to sleep and now you got me all wound up again Voldenet :) I hope that didn't come off as flaming you, it was meant to be more like...an empassioned but thorough and logically reasoned refutation, and hopefully something for everyone here to think about. nothing personal intended

[08:15] *** dakkar joined
[09:16] <Voldenet> refactus: I'm not even mad, because you're right – MS did buy github to legally feed AIs with code in it - it's just that every single git repo is one clone away from scrapping and most AI companies don't care about licenses

[09:20] <refactus> yes, but using them indirectly translates into their profit. I get sick thinking about all the moral and humanitarian disasters they have been and still are caught up in. US ICE, the IDF's target identification AI running on Azure, the list goes on and on and on

[09:21] <refactus> and cool, glad my passion doesn't cause offense

[09:24] <refactus> I agree they can try to just scrape it elsewhere, but other sites are implementing measures against that. maybe not 100%, maybe never will be, but that doesn't mean I don't do everything I can to abandon bad things and support good things

[09:25] *** lichtkind joined
[09:30] <Voldenet> for bigger git providers there's chance for legal abuse, for smaller git providers there's chance of outages and other technical problems – it's always some sort of tradeoff

[09:30] <refactus> I'm fine with that tradeoff

[09:31] <Voldenet> regarding morality – imo, all companies that get big enough do evil stuff because of their scale

[09:31] <Voldenet> they don't start evil, but the more people they have, there's more chances for vile ones

[09:32] <refactus> I don't disagree. codeberg is not a company, it's a nonprofit with 800-something members with voting rights

[09:34] <refactus> also both of those I mentioned are based in the EU and subject to GDPR among other things

[09:34] <Voldenet> to be perfectly honest, gdpr is a joke :(

[09:35] <Voldenet> I've seen many times how people handle user data and gdpr didn't change much - there's still huge db dumps being sent over email

[09:36] <refactus> I'll go with something that appears to be trying not to be evil over something like MS any day. if what I'm using seems to turn bad, then I'll stop using it, just like github.

[09:36] <Voldenet> the only thing it changed is that we get the silly popups yet companies still do stuff like this https://localmess.github.io/

[09:38] <refactus> that says meta and yandex, what does it have to do with GDPR?

[09:39] <Voldenet> facebook does extensively operate in europe

[09:39] <Voldenet> as corporate entities getting revenue and paying taxes

[09:40] <Voldenet> btw, nice that codeberg uses anubis, I hope more people use it

[09:40] <refactus> but they aren't based there. I'm talking about a german company and a dutch non-profit, very much more able to be held to account

[09:41] <refactus> I'm glad anubis is something that can be done, but it's wasting more power in the process, bit of a double-edged sword, climate-wise

[09:42] <refactus> wait I think I had that backwards. a german non-profit and a dutch company

[09:44] <refactus> that's right, codeberg was the german one, I remember because they specifically have an anti-nazi clause in their terms which made me smile

[09:45] <Voldenet> climate-wise premature optimization is the root of all evil, my fridge probably consumes more power than all my PCs and servers combined

[09:45] <Voldenet> so… if I really wanted to change things, I'd stop eating food that needs low temperatures

[09:46] <Voldenet> oops, I forgot it's #raku channel, let's stop the offtopic before someone sees

[09:47] <refactus> not like anyone else was using the space. I'm pretty sure there's people around here who care about these things, like the support for ukraine at the end of every weekly. and anyways we're talking about github, which is almost on topic :)

[09:49] <refactus> an average fridge over time averages like 300ish watts

[09:49] <Voldenet> I agree that git provider can be changed and maybe github really is not the best place for hosting code anymore though

[09:50] <refactus> not saying we shouldn't use anubis, just saying from the climate perspective I'm not sure if it's a net win against ai or not

[11:08] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus “and cool, glad my passion doesn't cause offense“ — To me it sounds like ranting because of frustrations with combinatorics calculations. (Understandable.)

[11:13] <refactus> heh my heart kinda dropped for a moment, thought you were serious until I read the second half of the message :) funny thing I didn't even end up using that script to pick my name. guess it was a good exercise though, kinda felt like solving one of those tech interview questions or something

[11:17] <refactus> "how would you generate all combinations of the characters in a given string which are a user specified length and comprised of alternations of vowels and consonants" like I'm applying at google

[11:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> Using Koremutake, of course.

[11:24] <refactus> never heard of it, reading. that's an interesting concept. without some practice I think I'd be better at memorizing the number, though

[11:25] <disbot1> <antononcube> See “Lingua::NumericWordForms”

[11:29] <disbot1> <antononcube> I think at some point I made experiments of finding pet names that are valid Koremutake numbers/strings.

[11:30] <disbot1> <antononcube> “Data::Generators” has ~    100K pet names.

[11:31] <refactus> somehow that's even more nerdy than the long sequences of numbers I've memorized

[11:54] *** apac left
[11:58] <disbot1> <antononcube> Hmm… it is more the “Machine Learning” way, but yeah, sure.

[12:05] <refactus> data::generators looks useful for an RPG of some sort, names and job titles for all the NPCs

[12:08] <disbot1> <antononcube> IMO, one of the best ways to learn a programming language from Machine Learning or Statistics point of view is to try to implement sequences or tables of random things.

[12:11] <refactus> huh, I guess that makes sense. I always thought of ML as throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks, even if it does make me sound ignorant. not that different in some ways though

[12:14] <disbot1> <antononcube> Sure, big part of it is that. But someone has to build the walls, even if you cook the spaghetti yourself,

[12:25] <refactus> I wrote a little javascript with circles that I trained to run away from my mouse cursor but not off the edge of the window, that's about as much as I know about it

[12:29] <disbot1> <antononcube> Incidentally, this how Skynet started.

[12:31] <refactus> haha, I actually just re-watched that a few weeks ago. kinda eery parallels with now, in some ways

[12:31] <disbot1> <antononcube> This probably can be with Raku -- meaning, Raku can generate the JavaScript for a plot and a reaction of mouse movement.

[12:33] <refactus> it certainly could, though I'm unclear how generating with raku would help. I just wrote it how I write everything, starting with a blank text file in vim

[12:35] <disbot1> <antononcube> Right -- your are one of "those" vim addicts. That is why you do not see how Raky would help.

[12:36] <disbot1> <antononcube> Raku ecosystem has a few Jupyter-notebook solutions. Those notebooks can execute JavaScript code auotmatically if is the results of a Raku sub.

[12:37] <disbot1> <antononcube> This is how the Raku-JavaScript plotting packages are used.

[12:41] <refactus> but...why? sounds like a pile of unnecessary tooling. not saying that's actually true, just saying I still don't understand the advantages it confers

[12:44] <disbot1> <antononcube> Hmm... There is this fundamental assumption: > Currently, you cannot do data science, machine learning, or any kind of meaningful scientific research without an interactive computational environment.

[12:45] <disbot1> <antononcube> Notebooks are best for that kind of usage.

[12:46] <disbot1> <antononcube> If someone wants to make Raku amenable for Data Science, a notebook solution or something very close to it is a must.

[12:48] <disbot1> <antononcube> LLMs introduces another reason of notebooks. (Interactivity, "keeping track" of chats, integration with other computations.)

[12:49] <refactus> I admit it probably takes me an extra 1 or 2 seconds longer to :w enter alt-tab control-r but I macro it when I really care about the extra second or two. is that all that makes my style not interactive?

[12:49] <refactus> maybe I should just try one of these notebook things and figure out what you're talking about

[12:50] <refactus> of course, then I have to learn emacs iirc

[12:52] <disbot1> <antononcube> I tried to use emacs with Raku -- the "raku-mode" is not good enough for Literate Programming (LT). Org-mode with Raku would be better for LT, but it does not keep a global state. (I.e. a special hook up with Raku has to be implemented for org-mode.)

[12:55] <refactus> you're talking about all kinds of tools I see mentioned but haven't used myself. I guess my programming is illiterate :)

[12:55] <disbot1> <antononcube> Happens, with the vi(m) addicts.

[12:56] <refactus> wikipedia says "a computer program is given as an explanation of how it works in a natural language, such as English, interspersed (embedded) with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated"

[12:56] <refactus> to me that sounds like just liberal use of multiline comments

[12:57] <disbot1> <antononcube> Hmm... right, of course. But it is more than that.

[12:57] <Xliff_> I'mma squat on codeberg, sourcehut AND github.

[12:57] <refactus> do it!

[12:57] <Xliff_> I'm already mostly on sourcehut.

[12:59] <refactus> nice. just be aware they intend to start charging a tiny monthly fee when they're out of alpha

[13:00] <disbot1> <antononcube> So, here is a workflow: (1) make an org-mode or Pod6 article / file which has both code and explanations, (2) "execute" that file to get the outputs of the code blocks added under them, (3) review the result, "woven" document,  (4) if not satisfactory goto 1, else end.

[13:01] <refactus> ohhh, the output goes back into the same file

[13:03] <refactus> and the fancy ones have graphing and equation solving and whatever else still in the same file

[13:15] <disbot1> <antononcube> I made a bunch of movies on the subject. As I mentioned if someone wants to do Data Science or Mathematical research with Raku, having a notebook solution is "a must."

[13:17] <refactus> I'm not sure I agree that it's the only way to work, but I understand you're saying that it's pretty much ubiquitous in those fields

[13:21] <disbot1> <antononcube> Right -- that is why earlier I wrote "Currently ..." Simply put, there are some expectations by the practitioners of certain fields about the tooling, and if certain set of tools does not exist they won't care about the programming language.

[13:25] <refactus> this is useful insight for me. I dropped out of high school 24 years ago and got an internship at a software company. learned most of what I know by reading, which was enough to pick up a few programming languages, some math and science and engineering, various stuff. so there's sometimes this diconnect between me and the people I ended up spending time around, because I don't have that academic

[13:25] <refactus> experience for context

[13:26] <disbot1> <antononcube> ✍️

[13:28] <disbot1> <antononcube> @refactus Well, what are you current interests programming-wise. (Or mathematics-wise.) Are you interested in LLMs?

[13:28] <refactus> yes that's my hand there on my spiral bound notebooks :)

[13:29] <disbot1> <antononcube> See this demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmLk9UB4_Ak

[13:39] <refactus> I'm at a bit of a fork in the road, haven't figured out which way to proceed. I have an amateur interest in the workings of LLMs and other AIs (among many other things), watched some 3blue1brown videos and read some articles about it. but I also should start worrying about an income again some time this year, so my focus will probably shift more towards things I already know soon

[13:39] <refactus> going to look at the video...

[13:56] *** topnep joined
[14:06] <refactus> it sure comes up with some interesting looking stuff

[14:10] <disbot1> <antononcube> Yeah. I have to try what images the newer models produce with that kind of code...

[14:17] <refactus> it's a clever idea, feeding a program into the AI and asking it to imagine what the output might look like

[14:19] <disbot1> <antononcube> It is not mine. I saw it in a post by one of (the great) Mathematica / Wolfram Language enthusiasts. He was not anonymizing the code though.

[14:20] *** euandreh left
[14:23] <disbot1> <antononcube> Here is one of his posts with that idea: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3112344

[14:24] <refactus> that seemed to make a large difference. but also sorta cool that it somehow blends a preconception of a koch curve with a vague interpretation of the code. if it were a person, we'd call that very creative thinking

[14:26] <disbot1> <antononcube> 👍 ➕ 🤷‍♂️

[14:29] <disbot1> <antononcube> In the Mathematica post see the "green stadium" images -- "green", "stadiumshape", "eigensystem" played big roles in DALL-E's renditions.

[14:30] <refactus> couldn't help but notice that one, pretty amusing

[14:32] <refactus> you should do more of them with the anonymized code, makes me wonder what they'd look like across more examples

[14:38] <refactus> it's interesting how the anonymized ones come out with lines connecting circles, almost like it's trying to visualize the code itself as a graph or an AST or something

[15:00] <disbot1> <antononcube> That would be more interesting to be done with a certain server / interactive interface for different codes with different LLMs.

[15:02] *** apac left
[15:12] <refactus> I used to write little interactive toy programs to get a better feel for certain things. had one for a tree fractal where you could change the number of iterations and branches, and sliders for the angle and scale. could manipulate it into making realistic-looking tree structures, sierpinski triangle, square and hex grids, etc just from playing with the variables. a much longer time ago when I was

[15:12] <refactus> still in school I wrote one in quickbasic for polynomials so I could actually change the coefficients and see how they affected the graph

[15:13] <refactus> so I agree, you should build some kind of interactive playground to generate these. though your notebook already kindof serves that purpose
