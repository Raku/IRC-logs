[04:41] <arkiuat> so I know that infix:<%> is for Numeric and that we should only apply infix:<mod> to Int, but both of them seem to work fine on all Numerics, but just give different results in some cases.

[04:42] <arkiuat> m: .say for -pi % 1, -pi mod 1

[04:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «0.8584073464102069␤-0.14159265358979312␤»

[04:42] <arkiuat> None of the differences seem to be tested for in roast, and maybe these differences are left out of the language spec deliberately, but I'm just curious about why

[04:44] <Voldenet> seems like % does what programmers would expect (return reminder) and mod does what matematicians would expect (return modulo)

[04:44] <Voldenet> remainder, even

[04:45] <Voldenet> hmmm actually

[04:46] <Voldenet> m: .say for -10 mod 60, -10 % 60 # I was wrong it seems

[04:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «50␤50␤»

[04:47] <arkiuat> huh, well, you made me realize that the results for -pi are respectively the floor and the ceiling of (-pi/1) subtracted from -pi

[04:48] <arkiuat> m: .say for -pi - (-pi/1).floor, -pi - (-pi/1).ceiling

[04:49] *** johnjaye left
[04:49] <Voldenet> % does "numeric modulo" and mod does "integer modulo" – there seems to be some distinction

[04:49] <Voldenet> though having both remainder and modulo operators would be sane

[04:50] *** lichtkind_ joined
[04:50] <arkiuat> right, but the tests in roast that are different only throw a couple of Rats at infix:<%> and a couple of very large Ints at infix:<mod>. There's nothing testing for this particular distinction

[04:51] *** johnjaye joined
[04:52] <Voldenet> (I mean, there seems to be distinction in docs)

[04:53] <arkiuat> really? all I could find in docs was that one of them is for Int, and the other coerces to Numeric first

[04:53] *** lichtkind__ left
[04:54] <Voldenet> see for yourself: https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_%

[04:54] <arkiuat> it does give the .floor identity for that one yes, but says nothing about .ceiling for the other

[04:55] <arkiuat> anyone reading would assume that the same identity was supposed to apply to both

[04:57] <Voldenet> in fact, mod for numerics doesn't seem specified at all

[04:57] <Voldenet> if it was actually coercing its operands to Int, it'd be 0

[04:58] <arkiuat> right, infix:<mod> doesn't coerce, although we're told it's for Int

[04:58] <arkiuat> we're only told that infix:<%> coerces to Numeric

[04:59] <Voldenet> > https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Real.rakumod#L144

[04:59] <arkiuat> ah, thank you!

[05:00] <Voldenet> so it literally is not specified anywhere

[05:06] <arkiuat> m: .say for &infix:<mod>.candidates, &infix:<%>.candidates

[05:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «(&infix:<mod> &infix:<mod>)␤(&infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%> &infix:<%>)␤»

[05:07] <arkiuat> so there may be other versions of infix:<%> running around than just what's there in the definition of role Real

[05:08] <arkiuat> m: .say for &infix:<mod>.candidates.elems, &infix:<%>.candidates.elems

[05:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «2␤13␤»

[05:13] *** melezhik joined
[05:13] <arkiuat> I just checked though, and those 13 are all just for different subtypes of Real, include natives and Duration

[05:15] <arkiuat> and couple or three rudimentary signatures that might just be to generate the right kind of Failure

[15:54] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: I was initially bemused by the % vs mod rounding ... but the chatGPT I referenced has an explanation (that I haven't double checked) in relation to continuous functions vs. eg compass direction modulo ... does that explanation make sense to you (or am I gullible and naive)?

[16:12] *** abraxxa left
[16:15] <ab5tract> patrickb: because Raylib takes a value struct for the functions related to loading Unicode glyphs

[16:16] <patrickb> ah! raylib, not terminal print
