[11:51] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> (Rakuun ~~ raccoon)

[11:53] <refactus> my first glance was koala https://images6.alphacoders.com/344/344809.jpg

[11:55] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Cute koala!

[11:57] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> The emoji raccoon on Discord is a pretty good match (it's just the :raccoon-face:). On both IRC and MacOS the emoji looks entirely different.

[12:02] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> (I started from a :cat: emoticon I found on Wikipedia, and worked from there).

[12:31] <refactus> wouldn't say you failed miserably. most people here would probably figure it out in context. no control over the font and text rendering is just always the limit of text art

[12:40] <refactus> we could be all postmodern and say it's a raccoon and a butterfly and a moth and a koala and they're all adorable. timtowtdi, right?

[19:51] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Well, go-lang people can be Gophers, rust people can be Rustaceans, so why not raku-lang people as Rakuuns?

[20:57] <disbot1> <__abrightlight__> "rakuuns" is quite clever üòÅ

[21:20] <disbot1> <antononcube> Why?

[21:26] <lizmat> PSA: it looks like irclogs.raku.org and Geth will be down on Mon 15 Sep from 0600 - 0800 UTC due to electricity works at their data center
