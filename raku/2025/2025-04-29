[00:14] <Xliff> How long does it take to Lock.protect? I am trying to have events write to the screen every 0.05 seconds. I will need to Lock.protect the screen while each element draws. Given that this is a TUI, I shouldn't have much trouble doing this with Raku, should I?

[08:37] <Voldenet> Xliff: last time I've check lock.protect took around 3us, so you can have 1000 components just fine - it depends if you are going to render scrollable lists with N items in TUI

[08:37] <tellable6> Voldenet, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[08:54] <melezhik> o/

[08:56] <melezhik> what RakuAST is going to change for "mere mortals"? My lasting expectation from Rakudo is performance , will it decrease rakudo programm start up time?

[09:02] <lizmat> no: RakuAST only lives at compilation, and most likely when you start your rakudo program, it already has been compiled

[09:03] <lizmat> and the bytecode (at least initially) will be the same as with the legacy grammar, or even less optimized (again, initially)

[09:05] <melezhik> i mean when I say descrease start time, time required to program to start when compiled data already in place is still wanting, at least for _my_ case ( Sparrow launches a lot of Raku proccesses and this is by design ) 

[09:06] <melezhik> just in general I wish rakudo will take less time to start a program 

[09:07] <melezhik> and hoped that RakuASK could do something about it, and now I see it is not, byt thanks for clarification anyways 

[09:08] <melezhik> Raku proccesses -> Rakudo proccesses ( when a whole new programm gets run as a separate proccess )

[09:11] <Voldenet> for that use case, I bet it'd be nice at some point to be able to reuse the compiler without reloading everything

[09:23] <melezhik> yeah, unfortunatelly or likely sparrow designs relies on separate procceess which makes some things very easy, and other things very hard

[09:23] <Voldenet> Have you checked whether checkpointing (criu?) would help?

[09:24] <melezhik> what's that?

[09:25] <Voldenet> the technique that lets you save running process into binary

[09:26] <Voldenet> I don't know whether startup time is slow enough that this would help though

[09:26] *** yewscion_ joined
[09:27] <Voldenet> and it would definitely complicate loading actual code

[11:11] <wayland76> .tell melezhik Regarding AST, while there's no optimisation improvements yet, it should give the opportunity for better optimisation in some cases.  In https://dev.to/fco/the-future-of-red-orm-for-raku-44gf skim down to the section called "The promise of RakuAST".  Short version: We might be able to compile some blocks to SQL and run them on the database server.  

[11:11] <tellable6> wayland76, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[11:12] <wayland76> Btw, the first hit for "red ORM ast" is still a Wikipedia page about a Viking story from the 10th century :) 

[11:13] <wayland76> No, my bad, a novel (1940s) set in the 10th century.  

[11:14] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/iEElWAPY/image.png

[11:14] <stanrifkin> Terminal::LineEditor does not support CTRL-L for clearing the screen, right?

[11:14] <wayland76> https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=red+orm+ast

[11:15] <SmokeMachine> yes... on google I got that... but my default id ddg... :)

[11:16] <wayland76> stanrifkin: According to https://raku.land/zef:japhb/Terminal::LineEditor it does "refresh-all", whatever that is.  

[11:16] <wayland76> SmokeMachine: Nice!  I tried it a few years back, but didn't quite manage to tear myself away from Google yet.  

[11:16] <SmokeMachine> wayland76: thanks for talking about that post... maybe that will help to change the first occurrence on google...

[11:17] <wayland76> haha, no worries :) .  

[11:18] <wayland76> Hmm.  For just "Red Orm", it's not even in the top 10 on Google.  That's more important to change.  

[11:19] <wayland76> Also, I'll probably at some point want to discuss whether there are any useful points of collaboration between Red ORM and the Table-Oriented Programming stuff.  

[11:20] <wayland76> But I want to finish more Table-Oriented Programming stuff before we get into that very far.  

[11:21] <SmokeMachine> wayland76: please, let me know when you want to discuss that (or any other thing...)

[11:21] <wayland76> One big difference though -- I want Table-Oriented Programming to support not just SQL, but also spreadsheets, and in-memory tables.  And CSV files.  

[11:23] <wayland76> I've currently got some basic TOP stuff going (I can make tables in either memory or Postgres with pretty much the same code, and can eg. read in a Linux command output as a table, and spit it out as a CLI table, or a CSV), but I'm currently working on the TOP operators (so that we can do a join between a CSV file and a Postgres table)

[11:24] <wayland76> Once the operators are done, there will be a few bits and pieces (ie. groups of columns), and then I'm going to call it MVP and put it on the back burner so I can do Tree-Oriented Programming (think being able to use XPath/XSLT operations in Raku code).  

[11:25] <wayland76> (Just trying to give some idea of a timeline)

[11:25] <wayland76> I'll probably talk to you once I have MVP and before I put it on the back burner.
