[00:08] <tonyo> melezhik: no, it doesn't provide a way to do that. an endpoint could probably be added to the zef eco to redirect you to the correct place but i'm still pretty busy migrating the current setup to the lib

[00:08] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[15:43] <tbrowder> hi, i'm working on a PR for jmerelo's distro Pod::Load (see  it at https://github.com/JJ/p6-pod-load). There I filed an issue to update terminology to modern usage. one person thinks Pod::Load might not be useful for Rakudoc V2, but i say it will always be useful for ones who do not need Rakudoc V2. if you have any opinions on the subject, please add a comment to issue #22 for Pod::Load (note JJ has added a üëç to the issue).
