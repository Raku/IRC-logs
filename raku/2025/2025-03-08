[16:56] <Guest78> Can someone give me a hint what's going on with [*] here:

[16:56] <Guest78> [0] > my @a = (); [+] @a

[16:56] <Guest78> 0

[16:56] <Guest78> [1] > my @a = (); [*] @a

[16:56] <Guest78> 1

[16:56] <Guest78> It's actually useful in my case, but I would have expected [*] to also give zero.

[18:13] <[Coke]> it's the identity result - X+0 = X; X*1 = X

[18:13] <[Coke]> (In case they come back or check logs)

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - took a better look at p6-react - wow indeed, I had just looked at the synopsis ... but very impressed with all the stuff under the hood - once again SmokeMachine you are the man!

[19:00] *** librasteve_ joined
[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that said, I think that there is still value in a functional style ...

[20:24] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I don’t know if you have seen it, but I have a few of html component’s modules… :)

[20:25] <lizmat> ?  

[20:29] *** Aedil left
[20:29] <SmokeMachine> sorry, just meaning that may have a few more cool ways... (just trying to promote some modules... sorry...)

[20:30] *** Tirifto left
[20:32] *** jpn left
[20:35] <lizmat> the best way to promote a module, is to write a blog post about it  :-)

[20:50] <SmokeMachine> I said that because the paste was showing cool ways to component… so… there are some other ways…
