[09:57] <lizmat> apogee_ntv++

[09:57] <apogee_ntv> I really like mi6 already :D

[09:58] <lizmat> yeah, so do I  :-)

[09:59] <apogee_ntv> Is there any way to tell it to use a specific ssh identity file when pushing to git?

[10:00] <lizmat> *phew*   I only ever use one identity  

[10:00] <apogee_ntv> Yeah I have one for a client Azure cluster and it keeps trying to use that :D

[10:00] *** librasteve joined
[10:02] *** wayland76 joined
[10:05] *** librasteve left
[10:05] <apogee_ntv> It's not a major inconvenience, I just have to do a manual git push after everything else is done.

[10:07] * lizmat thinks that should be googleable

[10:07] <lizmat> perhaps an env variable ?

[10:07] <apogee_ntv> Thinking about it yeah I could probably export GIT_SSH_COMMAND from .zshrc

[10:08] *** arkiuat joined
[10:08] <apogee_ntv> I very rarely use the other identity for git, only terraform for that Azure cluster which changes once in a blue moon.

[16:26] <apogee_ntv> How can I compile a string as a regex? i.e. I have "/foo/gi" in a string (dynamic input) and want to make a Regex method from it?

[16:30] <tonyo> is gi the replacement or flags?

[16:31] <apogee_ntv> flags

[16:34] <apogee_ntv> From spec: - regex pattern: A Regular Expression pattern that is used to match the text, for example, `/hello/i`.

[16:34] <tonyo> are you able to separate the flags?

[16:34] <tonyo> m: my $x = "foo"; say "hello foo" ~~ m/$x/;

[16:34] <apogee_ntv> I should be able to string split

[18:01] <Voldenet> in the worst case you can always use eval

[18:01] <Voldenet> m: my $x = "f(.)\$0"; use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL; my $rx = EVAL("rx:i/$x/"); say ($_, $_ ~~ $rx) for <FOO foo FOP fo>

[18:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar f52cc9284: OUTPUT: ¬´(FOO ÔΩ¢FOOÔΩ£‚ê§ 0 => ÔΩ¢OÔΩ£)‚ê§(foo ÔΩ¢fooÔΩ£‚ê§ 0 => ÔΩ¢oÔΩ£)‚ê§(FOP Nil)‚ê§(fo Nil)‚ê§¬ª

[18:02] <Voldenet> it's extremely unsafe, but snce regexes are pretty much code, you have trust the input anyway

[18:02] <Voldenet> otherwise denial of service attacks are possible

[23:12] *** librasteve joined
[23:15] <guifa> What's the type?

[23:15] <guifa> some classes aren't designed to be instantiated (e.g. can't do .new on them)
