[08:40] <Voldenet> simon_sibl: $address variable may end up being 0.0.0.0 a lot of times, consider having optional web_url parameter for most common cases of using nginx as proxy

[08:40] *** maylay joined
[08:41] <Voldenet> or cloudflare as proxy

[08:41] <Voldenet> you could get a header, but there's no fully reliable way to ask server about its user-facing url anyway

[08:45] <disbot> <simon_sibl> you mean when generating the links right ?

[08:49] <disbot> <simon_sibl> its added üôè

[08:50] <disbot> <simon_sibl> can bind to 0.0.0.0 and choose the url to display

[08:52] <Voldenet> yeah, when generating the page - it's not major, but good practice to support it

[08:52] <Voldenet> ‚Ä¶and even better to set it ;)

[08:54] <disbot> <simon_sibl> thanks for the feedback, appreciate it !
