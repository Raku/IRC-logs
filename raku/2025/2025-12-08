[08:36] <Voldenet> it's kinda expected, if I had computational problems I would use nativecall

[08:37] <Voldenet> and C probably

[08:40] <Voldenet> however `Are the compile times included in the measurements?` `No`

[08:40] <Voldenet> and also, the code isn't measuring jit

[08:42] <disbot6> <antononcube> Worse, it does not have Mathematica / Wolfram Language in the comparison.

[08:44] <Voldenet> also, benchmark is cheating by classifying numpy code as python

[08:44] <Voldenet> …inline python could use numpy as well

[08:45] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6GgqJJqC

[08:46] <SmokeMachine> I know that’s not related to Raku, but I’d really love to hear your thoughts on my new project: https://github.com/FCO/git-issue?tab=readme-ov-file

[08:46] <SmokeMachine> It’s a way to have issues inside a git repo without depending on the host’s issue system (like GitHub). The issues live inside the git repository itself, so you can move your repo anywhere and the issues come along with it.

[08:46] <SmokeMachine> It also has a React page (which I asked an AI to build) that reads the refs from the host (for now it only works with the GitHub API, but the idea is for it to support any host) and lists the issues. Ideally it should also be able to create new issues, but I’m not sure that’s possible without a backend.

[08:46] <SmokeMachine> This creates “a new git command” (git issue) with a few subcommands (I’ll add more soon) to manage issues.

[08:46] <SmokeMachine> What do you think?

[08:49] <Voldenet> it sounds like a good way to make huge repo

[08:49] <Voldenet> and in the worst case painfully slow

[08:59] *** dakkar joined
[09:02] <SmokeMachine> Why? I have worked with repos with many refs and never got slow… and the issues refs are not pulled by default, only when you ask for specifically that.

[09:07] <Voldenet> define "many", 1000? 10000? 100000?

[09:08] <Voldenet> it could be enough for projects with under 100 issues total

[09:09] <SmokeMachine> I can let it to be worried about that when any repo using that gets more than 1000 issues…

[09:10] <SmokeMachine> (That would be a problem for the js)

[09:11] <Voldenet> js gets them one by one so perhaps with just 30 it'd get very slow

[09:12] <SmokeMachine> Yes, the js will be slower as more issues you have… and may not work passing the GitHub api limit…

[09:12] <Voldenet> well, with more than 30 you'd get banned from github api quickly ;)

[09:13] <Voldenet> so – consider keeping issues in one file

[09:13] <Voldenet> basic one-item-per-line markup with title, some tags that would be an index

[09:14] <SmokeMachine> I plan to make it prepare the file when you work on issues locally, that way you would have most of the issues already on the file…

[09:14] <Voldenet> it'd still get large fast

[09:15] <Voldenet> in a lot of projects I work with, I see people write more text about the code than the actual code

[09:16] <SmokeMachine> But it’s already added to the html file when the issue is created, it would load it fast, right?

[09:17] *** tgt joined
[09:18] <Voldenet> at some point you'd see huge lag in browser because of many items

[09:20] *** abraxxa-home joined
[09:20] <SmokeMachine> I can have arrays of issues, one array for each page, and the js would load only 1 each time

[09:20] <Voldenet> (actually loading 200MB of json is fast btw)

[09:52] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: ir seems the link for HARC is wrong…

[09:53] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I have a question: do you think something like Crolite could help on harc examples? I mean, it would make it easier to run the examples?

[10:00] *** mahlay left
[10:01] *** mahlay joined
[10:04] <disbot6> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: thanks! link should be OK now

[10:05] <disbot6> <librasteve> on Crolite - not really - I think that we could move a bunch of Cro tests from t/ to xt/ so that we do not have to advice --/test on install

[10:06] <disbot6> <librasteve> melezhik: kudos to @antononcube for that!

[10:38] <ab5tract> That would be an amazing change for the db library that wants pg installed and running too

[11:20] <SmokeMachine> I’m still plan to do that on Red… but never got time to have it done… if some one would like to PR that change, I would like very much…

[11:22] <disbot6> <librasteve> sorry to pile in, but to help people use your great code, it would really help to fix this ... right now, I have to advise zef install Red --exclude="pq:ver<5>"

[11:24] <disbot6> <librasteve> (and it took me a while to work out that this is fairly safe option ... here are the notes I keep in my local drive https://gist.github.com/librasteve/e5dd78c9516190ae4b876d6f39856c08)

[11:26] <disbot6> <librasteve> so I am worried that as soon as someone wants to try the Red in HARC (hint - what colour is Rudoplhs nose?) and goes slightly off piste from my install advice, they will suffer

[12:02] <tbrowder>  g'day all. regarding putting an article on the advent as draft. would this be a workable solution: (1) create a Markdown article. (2) publish it on Github. (3) copy the rendered result, and (3) paste it to an empty draft article on the Worspress site.

[12:04] <disbot6> <librasteve> tbrowder: if you can do (1) -- just create a markdown article, I will happily do the rest ...

[12:04] *** tgt left
[12:21] <tbrowder> that's a deal, how shall i get it to you?

[12:22] <disbot6> <librasteve> can you put it in the GH repo (eg via PR) here, please: https://github.com/Raku/advent/tree/main/raku-advent-2025/articles

[12:23] <tbrowder> wilco

[12:28] *** melezhik joined
[12:31] <tbrowder> i'll call mine "tbrowder1.md"

[12:53] <SmokeMachine> Yes… I need to get some time for that, or a PR… :)

[12:54] <Voldenet> > cd Cro; mv t/* xt/*; git add -A; git commit -m "Made test fast"

[12:55] <Voldenet> what could go wrong

[12:55] <Voldenet> truth be told, people never run these tests anyway, so maybe simple sanity test "start http server, do http request to it" would be enough

[12:55] <Voldenet> and probably more useful

[13:45] <tbrowder> ok, an empty place holder is in that spot...will post a look-see draft this pm cdt

[13:47] <tbrowder> or soon, but it's not ready for prime time yet, pm critiques welcome...

[13:48] <disbot6> <antononcube> The so called "full list of articles" of the Raku advent blog has only three article links.

[14:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve I scheduled my Dec 9th Raku advent post. I use "Hilite::Simple" in it, but I have not figured out how its output to be properly shown. (I.e. the output now is black-and-white.)

[14:46] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: actually the start server, check page is opne I would put in xt - because eg localhost may not be configured, or firewall posrt may be closed, etc

[14:46] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube thanks - i'll take a look in an hour or so

[14:53] <[Coke]> antononcube - ML::AssociationRuleLearning is failing tests due to missing "Data::ExampleDatasets"

[14:54] <[Coke]> Seen in brownie testing, working on extracting a reproducable test for you.

[14:54] <disbot6> <antononcube> @Coke I will take a look.

[15:05] <Voldenet> librasteve: It's possible to deny local connections and so on, but In practice 127.1:random would cover most useful test case I think (+ you can still skip tests!)

[15:09] <disbot6> <librasteve> Voldenet: i am not convinced - i think the failure mode of "my firewall is set to deny all inbound ports" is quite frequent in particular for new, inexperienced users, I would recommend that zef succeeds (ie the libraries and apps install in any case), but that the cro run or equivalent fails (perhspas with some fairly prominent "have you checked this" kind of help in the Getting Started)

[15:11] <Voldenet> Yes – deny all inbound ports, but not on loopback connections

[15:14] *** melezhik_ left
[15:14] *** melezhik_ joined
[15:16] <Voldenet> a lot of things would fail without 127.1 properly working though it's possible to run tests on entirely synthetic http request I suppose

[15:16] <Voldenet> so that Cro gets tested and not tcp
