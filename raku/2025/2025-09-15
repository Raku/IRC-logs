[09:52] <Voldenet> rakoon

[09:52] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> The spelling Rakuun clearly implies a reference to Raku and militates against your ChatGPT reference.

[09:55] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roni_(mascot)

[09:57] <Voldenet> tbh. first time I'm hearing that raccoon is another offensive word

[09:58] <Voldenet> in fact

[09:59] <Voldenet> LLMs are not valid source for anything

[10:01] <Voldenet> and apparently, coon is offensive, not raccoon

[10:18] <refactus> yes. in the US that word is equally as bad as the N word and formed the basis of an entire genre of racist country folk music over a century ago. but fully formed "raccoon" is usually fine, e.g. guardians of the galaxy. still, using it to refer to a person under the wrong circumstances *might* lead to some...contextual misunderstanding...

[10:21] <Voldenet> hence I propose to use entirely different spelling

[10:21] <Voldenet> rakoon, rakun or rakuun maybe

[10:31] <refactus> that only works in text, not speech. also the k looks very off to people who aren't aware of raku. because people subtly signaling support for terrible things will sometimes change Cs to Ks as a nod to the KKK

[10:32] <refactus> I'm not arguing against, just sadly describing the context

[10:32] <Voldenet> I bet one day I'll find out that my own name is offensive to someone in some language

[10:34] <refactus> well you're already He Who Shall Not Be Named, so... :D

[10:35] <Voldenet> how about rakumancers

[10:36] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> "Raku" in Japanese means the following:

[10:36] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> noun/adjective: comfort, ease, relief, (at) peace, relaxation adjective/noun: easy, simple, without trouble, without hardships adjective/noun: (economically) comfortable abbreviation/noun: raku pottery

[10:37] <Voldenet> rakujin ;)

[10:37] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Source: https://www.japandict.com/楽

[10:38] <Voldenet> how about connecting raku with therapy, ra…

[10:38] <Voldenet> yeah nevermind

[10:38] <refactus> lol

[10:39] <Voldenet> if we're using japanese raku, then maybe rakuzoku

[10:40] <Voldenet> but it doesn't fit into english all that well

[10:40] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> So a Japan-o-phile who loves "comfort, ease, relief, (at) peace, relaxation" cannot call himself/herself a "Raku-un"?

[10:45] <Voldenet> I think they can, because programmers are smart enough to understand even "racoon" from the context

[10:45] <Voldenet> it's highly informal anyway

[10:47] <refactus> people can say what they want. to the majority of people it'd be fine and not thought about like this. just explaining the extreme end of how someone might take something wrong if they didn't understand the context

[10:48] <ab5tract> I sometimes think of myself as a Rakuan

[10:48] <ab5tract> That's close enough to racoon to allow for using a racoon as an additional mascot

[10:53] <Voldenet> and if someone's offended enough, you can explain that it's from animal name, because raku programmers like to code at night

[10:53] <Voldenet> or something like that ┐(´～`；)┌

[10:54] <refactus> if someone's offended I'd explain the truth which is that it's just wordplay with raku as in japanese pottery

[10:56] <ab5tract> Voldenet: or maybe, "someone's trash is another's treasure" (playing off the trash panda nickname ;) 

[10:57] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @ab5stract Thank you! Yes, -un as a (playful) alternative spelling to the more common -an suffix: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-an

[10:58] <ab5tract> I guess I just like both the sound of rakuan more than rakuun and the way it appears as text

[11:06] <refactus> apparently they're regarded as an invasive species in europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoons_as_an_invasive_species

[11:06] <refactus> I still think they're adorable personally

[11:08] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> I like the unusual spelling, makes rakuun easy to search. Very few words ending in -uun.

[11:10] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Regarding uun words, all I can find so far (aside from "Bruun" which is a surname) is WELTANSCHAUUNG.

[12:22] <disbot1> <melezhik.> For those who doe’s bioinformatics or scientific calculations using data flows or data pipelines , I have dropped of very simple yet useful example of porting Nextflow pipeline to Sparky/Sparrow - https://github.com/melezhik/mixing-script-langauges/tree/main

[12:30] <disbot1> <antononcube> Interesting— haven’t heard about Nextflow before.

[13:39] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> NextFlow is written in Groovy.

[13:55] <disbot1> <antononcube> I browsed the examples. The pipelines of Nextflow do not look like pipelines to me. But that is just a "cosmetics" observation.

[13:56] <disbot1> <antononcube> Is there a Raku package that extracts class method signatures of programming languages other than Raku?

[13:57] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> https://www.nextflow.io

[13:57] <disbot1> <antononcube> I can make such package and/or "just" use LLMs. But since I am too eager to do those, I would rather evaluate alternatives first.

[13:59] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> https://www.wkrn.com/sports/tennessee-titans/t-rac-facts/

[14:00] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> I've used it (NextFlow), but I'm far from an expert. Glad to see Alexey is working on RakuFlow!!!!

[14:39] <melezhik> Antononcube: whatever it's called, most of the time, AFIK this is just a bunch of computation tasks executed as map reduce or some sort of parallelization, also tasks could be anything - scripts on different languages - this is perfect spot for Sparrow/Sparky

[14:41] <melezhik> I think if I find someone who would like to invest time into this ( ideally people from science, bio informatics, statistics ) we could create a great platform on top of Sparrow/Sparky and advance Raku in that way 

[14:42] <melezhik> This topic is just not my main professional area, however it'd be interesting to work with such a people  

[14:42] <melezhik> data engineers, data scientists , etc 

[14:43] <melezhik> another well known product from these series is Apache Airflow which is written on Python
