[06:57] <Xliff> G'morning. Anyone around?

[06:57] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Around what?

[06:57] <Xliff> Aha!

[06:58] <Xliff> If I have a compunit called A::B and a class in that compunit called A::B. How can I get the symbol table of the compunit A::B?

[07:08] <Xliff> scullucs: Eh. I worked around it. If you do know the answer, please share. It might prove useful in the future.

[07:08] <Xliff> Thanks anyways.

[07:16] <lucs> I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer your question.                                                                        

[07:16] <lucs> (I'm really not that knowledgeable.)                                                                                            

[07:16] <lucs> Maybe your workaround (and its context) would prove even more useful?                                                           

[07:24] <lucs> (sorry about the trailing spaces, copy/paste is sometimes confusing)

[07:30] <Xliff> Heh. I actually hardcoded the extra classes I needed.

[17:53] <El_Che> .that seems to do it, thx for thinking with us for a solution

[17:54] *** ulipink left
[17:55] <lizmat> *phew*  :-)

[17:55] <jdv> catastrophe averted!

[17:56] <El_Che> core breach averted

[18:05] <[Coke]> I'm just glad I don't have to make a point release!

[18:13] <El_Che> amen to that

[18:28] <lizmat> whee!  El_Che++

[18:29] <[Coke]> El_Che++

[18:37] <[Coke]> yay, finally have a powershell config where I can launch raku and get the unicode support correct without running any commands

[18:37] <lizmat> perhaps that could use sharing and/or documenting ?

[18:39] <[Coke]> in powershell, need:

[18:39] <[Coke]> $OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new() 

[18:39] <[Coke]> [console]::InputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new()

[18:39] <[Coke]> I put it into my startup (that was the part I was missing) so now it will just work

[18:39] <[Coke]> the default is "utf8 but with BOM"
