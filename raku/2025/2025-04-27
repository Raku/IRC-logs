[11:15] <wayland76> Question: I've just noticed that "Baggy Multiplication" and "Baggy Addition" have the same unicode symbol (Union with dot), but orthogonality would suggest that one should be Intersection with dot instead.  

[11:15] <wayland76> I'm basing this off the current docs, and a quick skim of the source.  

[11:16] *** sjn left
[11:17] <lizmat> that feels like a copy-pasto in the doc
