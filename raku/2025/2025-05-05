[07:01] <sjm__> hello melezhik. - thanks for making yourself known. I hope to avoid SSH for remote tasks - SSH is big and designed for human use, I would prefer something much tighter and designed for machine to machine comms. I created an outline spec for what I want, not yet found an implementation. Is there a Sparrow channel? 

[07:01] <tellable6> 2025-05-05T06:16:05Z #raku <melezhik.> sjm_: what‚Äôs about Sparrow? I am here to help )))

[07:19] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Hey, sjm__, I don‚Äôt recall if there is raku-sparrow irc channel, but it‚Äôs not used and kind of abandoned. If you use discord there is sparrow discord channel I can send you invite

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> It‚Äôs in here actually - https://discord.gg/YH8qHXWy

[19:53] <timo> traits are just‚Ñ¢ multi candidates on the sub trait_mod:<is>

[19:53] <timo> so you can re-export them like normal subs, but with this funky name
