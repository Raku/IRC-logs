[00:55] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> I'm currently trying to figure out a way to pass a type as a parameter to a function but I'm getting an error

[00:58] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> https://pastecode.io/s/jnn4mpc3

[00:58] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> anyone have an idea what might be the problem?

[01:03] <ugexe> the error should tell you exactly what line and what the issue is

[01:04] <ugexe> anyways your issue is you aren't passing a value for :$size but you are using it in string context (like the error states)

[03:31] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @ugexe i'm trying to create a multi sub that checks produces a different result depending on whether the named parameter :$size is provided or not, but it looks like the multi sub where the named parameters are an empty list/hash it looks like isn't being dispatched

[03:32] <ugexe> if you want :$size to be required for that multi then make it so, i.e. :$size!

[03:32] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> that's what i was missing, thanks!

[08:56] <nige123> librasteve_ thanks for helping with the Advent calendar this year - I've posted an entry for today - but it doesn't appear here: https://raku-advent.blog/ - is there anything I need to tag/update on my side?

[09:31] <melezhik> Yep, see it . heartbeat from loving-buck-34594827, version: 0.0.36, max threads: 19

[09:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> @nige123 I see this post: https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/01/day-1-dancer-dasher-and-dosh/

[09:34] <disbot6> <antononcube> But it is not linked to the "umbrella post" https://raku-advent.blog/2025/11/03/the-2025-raku-advent-posts/

[09:35] <disbot6> <antononcube> I do not see it by just going to : https://raku-advent.blog .

[09:40] <nige123> antononcube - how do i link it to the umbrella post?

[09:45] <disbot6> <antononcube> I don’t think it is you who should do it…

[09:45] <nige123> OK - no worries

[09:46] <nige123> I seem to have "reader" permission only on that page
