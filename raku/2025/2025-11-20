[10:45] <disbot2> <librasteve> i'm probably a bit late to the naming party (!), but I wanted to chime in ...

[11:15] <disbot2> <librasteve> avuserow: the etiquette is (i) when a module is uploaded to the ecosystem (eg via fez) it becomes immutable after a 24 hour grace period ... no amount of begging or whining will get tonyo to relent and delete it (I think the idea is that when it's in the ecosystem then it can become a depedency and therefore, any chance can break 3rd party code, fair enough)

[11:19] *** arkiuat left
[11:20] <disbot2> <librasteve> (ii) OK but the fully qualified module name is something like Physics::Constants:ver<1.0.8>:auth<zef:librasteve>:api<1> so you could use to upload an alternative implementation of Physics::Constant with your auth. For example if/when I go under a bus, or just go quiet on GH Issues, I would hope that someone would fork my modules on GH and do this (after some bonafide effort to attempt to resuscitate me) ... while you can choose any version number,

[11:20] <disbot2> the "right" thing to do is to bump the version (probably a major) when you do this. This way a vanilla zef install Physics::Constant will pick up your new version with the needed fixes

[11:21] <disbot2> <librasteve> (iii) so if you as a consumer of a module want to prevent such potentially breaking changes, then you can pin the auth and/or the ver in your use statement (and your META6.json is yoou are making a module).

[11:29] <disbot2> <librasteve> avuserow: I did just move (with the original authors permission) the Data::Dump::Tree module to raku-community-modules, to do this you need write permission on the raku-community-modules GH repo (and maybe there is a tweak on the permissions in fez?) ... I share Coke's reluctance for us to move all modules to this community (because support by all can quickly mean support by none) so yes please do try a 1:1 adoption first ... fwiw I think we

[11:29] <disbot2> should apply criteria such as the general level of adoption and potentuial value to the raku project to make the decision (so if you still think there is a case, then suggest you make a raku problem solving issue and we can consider properly) ... in the case of Data::Dump::Tree I felt that this WAS the case since it is a very general and well established debugging tool

[14:24] <arkiuat> I've been working on docs issue #3881 and I've written a big chunk of text to add to /type/Instant.rakudoc; I think it should be shorter and clearer, but not say a lot less than it is saying right now. The current draft is at https://gist.github.com/arkiuat/f4baa44430034ffc512fb4414242e483 if you'd like to take a look and suggest cuts

[14:32] <arkiuat> and incidentally, https://irclogs.raku.org/raku/live.html doesn't seem to be updating

[14:33] <arkiuat> or, it's updating weirdly

[15:07] <disbot2> <holmdunc> patrickb: The first part of that Homebrew path varies between Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. On the former it will be /usr/local instead of /opt/homebrew (In either case, can be verified by running brew --prefix)

[15:10] *** melezhik joined
[15:46] <ugexe> holmdunc: that sound sright, but does it vary between intel and apple silicon, or between x86 and arm packages (since apple silicon homebrew can install either or)

[15:58] *** arkiuat left
[16:05] <disbot2> <holmdunc> AFAIK it is just an overall thing. With the one wrinkle that if someone migrated an entire macOS installation from an old Mac to an AS one, it might continue being /usr/local on it too

[16:06] *** Sgeo joined
[16:12] *** arkiuat joined
[16:14] <disbot2> <holmdunc> FWIW, it's possible to find a cleaner path (no version number in it) for an individual Homebrew package, by running e.g. brew --prefix rakudo or brew --prefix rakudo-star. For the latter, which I have installed, I get the output /usr/local/opt/rakudo-star, which is a symlink to the directory /usr/local/Cellar/rakudo-star/2025.11

[16:25] <patrickb> I'm fine with the prefix varying. I was more interested in the things after the homebrew prefix

[20:23] <disbot4> <aruniecrisps> if anyone uses vim, i've forked the vim-raku repository and have added a couple of tweaks for the time being: https://github.com/arunvickram/vim-raku

[20:23] *** arkiuat joined
[20:24] <disbot4> <aruniecrisps> the two big changes i've added are basically making sure that highlighting for Inf and NaN specifically ends at the word boundary, and I've also added highlighting for model and actor (from OO::Actors)

[20:24] <disbot4> <aruniecrisps> so instead of highlight Inf in word like Inflections, it only highlights Inf if it's standalone
