[12:16] <tbrowder> i'm using Cro::HTTP::Client to get some JSON strings that are in the compact form. i can take that and use JSON::Pretty on it in two more steps: from-json, then to-json. is anything saved by adding that filtering sequence somehow to this step:  my $body = await $resp.body-text;

[13:44] <ab5tract> It’s a style choice, in the end. You can do from-json await … and get the Raku structure directly.

[13:45] <ab5tract> But I don’t see how there could be a significant performance difference

[13:46] <ab5tract> So it’s more about how much you want to do on a single line, imo

[14:16] <ab5tract> antononcube: is there an LLM good enough to generate a Raku LSP, based on RakuAST

[14:18] <ab5tract> Or even just a zed compatible syntax highlighter

[14:20] <disbot2> <antononcube> I heard that Claude can be tuned to produce very good Raku results -- see the recent raku.land uploads "zef:slavenskoj". From the discussions with @nurturethevibe -- they are making a dedicated Raku-LLM from scratch using C based on Raku documentation, slack message, ecosystem READMEs, etc. -- that might work pretty good for the use cases you have in mind.

[14:22] <disbot2> <antononcube> I get good Raku results with relatively short and simple prompts like "CodeWriterX". Occasionally, I extend or tune that prompt to be more "targeted."

[14:55] <tbrowder> ab5tract: thank you, the no-diff in performance was my guess. for my purposes, clarity in mutiple steps helps me much of the time

[14:56] <tbrowder> my preferred style much of the time
