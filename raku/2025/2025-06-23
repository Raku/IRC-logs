[20:17] <timo> Xliff: really just grabbing the path from the error message, opening the file to see if the first few hundred bytes are valid unicode and look like text, and look for "GNU ld script" in it or something like that

[20:18] <timo> no clue if it's reasonable to try to support gnu ld script files apart from giving a better error message
