[11:22] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> not sure why it works with | but not with ||, I need it to follow the order I put them otherwise it breaks (it always goes for call instead of loop or other stuff)

[11:22] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> https://glot.io/snippets/hcz1ty347p

[11:23] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> (I know its very likely ugly to add the logic in the grammar but whatever, its just a test xD)

[11:26] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> omg I figured it out, its exactly about the order, just had to swap statement and code in the TOP rule

[11:28] *** arkiuat joined
[11:29] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> although the call is still "eating" the other ones before for some reason

[11:29] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> when using token statement { \s* [ <comment> || <loop> || <assignement> || <call> ] }

[11:33] *** arkiuat left
[11:37] <timo> you're using "token", maybe the lack of backtracking is causing unexpected non-matches?

[11:39] <timo> (also, be aware that glot.io runs rakudo 2024.01)

[11:40] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> it seems to be about backtracking, but I dont understand why it would need that

[11:40] *** arkiuat joined
[11:40] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> when I use regex for loop and statement it all work as expected

[11:40] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> but using rule for both, and removing call in statement, it works

[11:41] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> why adding call at the end breaks the loop, its before call with the || so it shouldnt matter ?

[11:41] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> ooooh

[11:41] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> wait no

[11:41] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> yeah idk xD

[11:43] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> how could I tell the parser stop searching after finding the first match in a || list ?

[11:44] <timo> i think \s and \n both match newlines, so \s* \n will always need to backtrack

[11:45] *** arkiuat left
[11:45] <timo> .o( this could be a thing we can statically determine and warn about, actually )

[11:49] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> hmmm

[11:49] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> I guess the loop one is causing me trouble

[11:49] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> maybe because of the backtrack you're telling me about

[11:50] <timo> oh, i read the code backwards, you actually have \n* \s*

[11:51] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> its probably because I am not supposed to do that but

[11:51] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> https://glot.io/snippets/hcz2luedap

[11:51] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> here for example, it clearly identifies the loop

[11:51] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> but it still runs the call code at the end of the match, and thats what I want to avoid

[11:52] <timo> do you know about Grammar::Tracer?

[11:53] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> I do not

[11:53] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> let me check

[11:54] <timo> right, "end" is both a syntactically valid call, but you really want it to match for the end of the loop instead

[11:55] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> yes exactly

[11:55] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> or I could add some code in the grammar if thats possible that only allow to call/match currently defined functions from %FNS ?

[11:56] <timo> you can put a negative lookahead in front of the <statement> like [<!before 'end'> <statement>]* 'end'

[11:57] <timo> yeah for example <?{ %FNS{$<fn>}:exists }>

[11:57] *** arkiuat joined
[11:58] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> it is indeed much better, those two addons, amazing

[11:58] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> thank you so much !

[12:00] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> while I understand the first one, not totally sure to understand the second one

[12:00] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> wouldnt it replace the result by True or False ?

[12:00] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> and try to match True/False ?

[12:01] *** arkiuat left

[13:33] <disbot1> <antononcube> @simon_sibl "Grammar::Tracer" is often useful, but, also often, not so much. It is mostly useful for finding hard to spot errors in LLM-generated grammars. (For me.)

[14:29] <disbot1> <librasteve> for any folks interested in contributing to the forthcoming London Perl and Raku Workshop (29th Nov), there is a call for talks at https://www.londonperlworkshop.com/talks

[14:29] <disbot1> <librasteve> weekly: https://www.londonperlworkshop.com/talks

[14:35] <disbot1> <antononcube> @librasteve I think submitting articles for Advent calendar is done by making PRs to Advent's repository, right?

[14:35] <disbot1> <librasteve> yes

[14:35] <disbot1> <antononcube> Also, what is the limit of the number per articles author? (Five?)

[14:35] <disbot1> <librasteve> well ... PR in author name and title, then follow the CONTRUBTING.md

[14:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> the limit is 23

[14:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> since I have reserved the 24 for lizmat annual summary

[14:36] <lizmat> librasteve++

[14:37] <disbot1> <antononcube> Agh, yes -- I could not remember where I read the submission rules. (I.e. in CONTRIBUTING.md.)

[14:37] *** arkiuat left
[14:37] *** Sgeo joined
[14:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> hopefully we will get a good mix of articles - 5 is probably at the top end since we will likely favour more authors than fewer

[14:40] <disbot1> <antononcube> I was mostly joking with 5. I think have 6-7 Raku articles/posts written at different levels of completion. But for the Advent I would most likely submit 2.
