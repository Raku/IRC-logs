[07:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hmmm - my normal worflow is fez upload immediately followed by zef install App::Crag --force-install which on other project within a minute or so gets me the new version ... I have tried this with latest App::Crag with a 2 mins delay and still see the old version ... will try in 10 mins

[07:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if Air you would write div :class("div$_") for 1..3

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <wayland76> tbrowder , think of a pod as "a group of containers that typically contains one container, but more is not unusual (about 1/3 of the time where I work).  You're right that the Perl use predates k8s, but it's probably more well known at this point.

[10:48] <tbrowder> lizmat: i was in bed last night without ready access to web. i haven't looked at docs yet but my memory of the situation internally is that the time porr

[10:50] <tbrowder> *time portion, if it has no reference to Z, is local time and the :timezone arg is essentially zero and has no effect on the result.

[10:55] <tbrowder> i do remember the many subtle signatures for the DateTime constructor were hard to distinguish, and there was no easy way left for a new variant. besides, you were concentrating on higher priority time issues. perhaps with RakuAST that can change.

[10:58] <tbrowder> librasteve, thanks, you did recomend harc before, and it does look like a good candidate.

[11:00] <tbrowder> and podlite is very interesting, but i'm too invested in raku using rakudoc to head in that direction any time soon

[11:10] <tbrowder> hm, i just added that "theory" to my test and it's wrong. looking more like a bug. checking docs...

[11:26] <tbrowder> checking core.c...erg, i may be too old for this...

[11:46] <tbrowder> no...just a challenge

[12:17] <Guest72> forgive me if I'm speaking out of ignorance, but from my read of the docs, julian-date and modified-julian-date are expected to return UTC time regardless of the object's timezone

[12:17] <Guest72> so maybe https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/75e3952ab2570e39ecd05fb77bc23a31b027f70a/src/core.c/DateTime.rakumod#L528 just needs to be using self.utc instead of self? something like my $utc = self.utc above it and then use $utc instead of self on that line?

[12:18] <Guest72> it'd be more efficient not to construct the intermediate utc object of course, but then you'd have to replicate all the logic in method in-timezone

[12:22] <tbrowder> you are right about the definition and our (i'm the guilty party) implementation. we don't have a specific method to convert julian-date back to local time, but we could (and probably should) add one.

[12:24] <Guest72> but the problem isn't converting back, it's that julian-date is ignoring the timezone offset, right? that's what .utc would fix, if I'm not mistaken

[12:24] <tbrowder> probably so

[12:25] <Guest72> m: for ^3 {DateTime.new("2025-05-19T17:00:00"~"%+03d".sprintf($_)).julian-date.say}

[12:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75e3952ab: OUTPUT: «2460815.208333␤2460815.208333␤2460815.208333␤»

[12:27] <Guest72> seriously I've just been lurking until lizmat pops up to talk to her about my abandoned modules, but I keep seeing things talked about I could help with and I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut lol

[12:28] <Guest72> sure one sec I'll pm it

[12:28] <tbrowder> thnx

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: I would say that to use Air for a simple, low scale website at the moment is pretty easy and gives you a nice looking result without much effort ...

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the limitation right now is that (until Themes become a thing) you are limited to Pico CSS and the various CSS variables as theme controls

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so, if you like this site https://picocss.com or this one https://harcstack.org (note the lightdark is an Air widget) then could be its for you, if not then if aint gonna work

[12:48] <tbrowder> back to julian-date. as Guest72 said, a .utc seems to do the right. another confusion is the :timezone arg is in *seconds*, so incrementing by 1 in the op's example wouldn't  do what the user expected anyway

[12:56] <tbrowder> hm, in my offline test that seemed to work...

[12:58] <Guest72> utc returns another datetime, but julian-date returns a Num so .utc.julian-date, not .julian-date.utc

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @arkiuat How long have you programmed / used Perl?

[14:27] *** Guest72 left
[14:30] <arkiuat> antononcube: I first learned Perl in 1996 and made my living mostly with it after that until 2001. It and now Raku has remained my fave since then, although I'm only hobbyist coder now.

[14:34] <[Coke]> ah, someone from my era. :)

[14:35] <[Coke]> I first started using perl in the mid 90s... on xenix and SCO

[14:35] <arkiuat> (catching up on tbrowder and Guest72/Kelly's discussion of the issue I filed). Thanks to both of y'all! The discussion is very illuminating

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good to know. I tried a to use Perl in 1998 for data pre-processing (for my PhD work.) Got scared by how I could not understand the Perl programs I wrote after a day or two, and rewrote them in Python.

[14:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, I read / followed Larry's book on Perl at that time -- very interesting and funny.

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think in the last 3 years I have earned close to an annual average developer salary via Raku.

[14:54] <arkiuat> antononcube: Raku is a big improvement!

[14:56] <lucs> arkiuat: Hi! So it is you.

[14:57] <lucs> Been a while, eh :)

[14:57] <lucs> Such a long while that I wasn't even sure of your original nick anymore and had to go through some old notes.

[14:58] <arkiuat> yes, it has been some time

[14:58] <lucs> You might remember the birthday list I used to maintain for people in the channel, that's where I confirmed the nic,

[14:58] <lucs> k

[14:58] <lucs> Brought back a lot of memories of people who hung out there back in the day.

[14:59] <arkiuat> Now that you maintained a birthday list is one thing I had forgotten

[14:59] <arkiuat> BTW, Guest72/Kelly completely explained how to do what I was trying to do when I ended up in the dead end that led to my filing the issue

[14:59] <lucs> Welp, I know your birthday, but nowadays, stuff like that is private, eh, so I won't tell :)

[15:00] <arkiuat> thanks!

[15:01] <lucs> I'm retired now and have put Perl completely aside, it's Raku all the way now.

[15:16] <tbrowder> ditto!! and no python whenever possible (most of the time)

[15:16] <arkiuat> good to hear, and congratulations

[15:23] <arkiuat> I too am strangely reluctant to return to Perl, even though there are modules I'd like to use that exist in Perl but not yet in Raku. I guess that means I get to be the one to reimplement them

[15:24] <arkiuat> Although it doesn't really work that way in practice: I'd end up implementing something better suited to my specific purpose that doesn't replicate the Perl module that does *most* of what I want

[15:27] <lucs> Reimplement is one way, but a lot of the Perl modules can be used in Raku by using the Inline::Perl5 Raku module.

[15:27] *** arkiuat left
[15:32] *** arkiuat joined
[15:32] <arkiuat> tbrowder, thanks again for your help on that issue

[15:33] <lucs> arkiuat: Did you catch my "try Raku's Inline::Perl5 module" message?

[15:33] <arkiuat> lucs, that's true, but even when I find myself using modules that in turn use old Perl like List::MoreUtils, I always find I want drop those and reimplement whatever it is the native Raku way. It's an itch

[15:34] <lucs> I know what you mean: I'm like that too.

[15:34] <arkiuat> if I were getting paid to do this, things like Inline::Perl5 might be very helpful

[15:35] <lucs> Hey, why did you change your nick? Was the original already taken?

[15:36] *** arkiuat left
[15:40] *** arkiuat joined
[15:41] <arkiuat> lucs, no, but I've been using arkuat as a handle for so many decades that I decided a change would more easily distinguish current incoming messages from blasts-from-the-past (including the spam that does get through, etc)

[15:41] <lucs> Ah, makes sense.

[15:41] <arkiuat> also, arkuat was an ignorant ancap with horrible politics, while arkiuat is more of a Pikettyan. my ways have changed in other matters as well, so i wanted to distinguish myself a bit from my past self

[15:42] <arkiuat> anyway, this web connection is no good. I'll be back later from ssh+screen (yeah, I know I should switch to tmux) after I look around for whatever is a good text-mode client these days

[15:43] <lucs> Well, welcome back, and see ya.

[15:43] <tbrowder> arkiuat: you're welcome, yr issue was timely, though, and pointed out the hole in the docs

[15:43] <arkiuat> tbrowder, good to hear!

[15:44] <lucs> (I still use irssi.)

[15:44] <arkiuat> lucs, thanks for the tip

[15:45] *** arkiuat left
[15:46] <[Coke]> I made the switch to tmux a while ago and... it's fine? I think the one thing I appreciate is that my mac iterm2 automatically reconnects to remote tmux sessions after it restarts.

[15:47] <lucs> [Coke]: Yeah, the "keep remote sessions alive" is a key feature.

[15:47] <tbrowder> [Coke]: for a doc pr, would you accept a ref to DateTime::Julian for converting julian-date to DateTime, or would you prefer a rakudo issue to add a new DateTiime routine to do that?

[15:48] <tbrowder> (along with a doc 

[15:48] <tbrowder> PR)

[15:49] <[Coke]> opening a rakudo issue isn't for me to decide on that.

[15:50] <[Coke]> As for the other... I guess that's OK

[15:51] *** arkiuat joined
[15:52] <arkiuat> tbrowder, I think the main thing is that the docs ought to make clear that julian-date ignores timezone information

[15:53] <arkiuat> Kelly pointing out that all you need to to get an accurate julian-date from a DateTime is add a .utc prefix to the call was enough for me

[15:56] <arkiuat> lucs, I've just installed irssi... it was quicker than I expected

[15:56] <lucs> Ah, nice. I hope the config won't be too painful.

[15:56] <arkiuat> default config seems to be working fine so far

[16:01] <arkiuat> tbrowder, right now the docs do say that it returns the JD for the UTC date and time, but it doesn't explicitly say that any timezone info in the DateTime is ignored, and I think that does need to be pointed out

[16:03] <arkiuat> the doc I'm referring to here is https://docs.raku.org/type/DateTime#method_julian-date 

[16:05] <tbrowder> yes, but for real use, an astronomer would start with a julian-data, the other way is trivial

[16:05] <tbrowder> julian-date

[16:06] <tbrowder> the docs correction for current use will be done regardless

[16:07] <tbrowder> i

[16:07] <tbrowder> gotta go to dentist...ugh...bye

[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> commaide.com is dead to me also

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i can't say if this is the true eol or whether something got crufty and needs a restart

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i think anyway that comma IDE has lost support and will soon just fall over since it is not being maintained to Intellij latest versions. if you want the commaide goodness then suggest you try a vanilla version of IntelliJ (Community Edition is free as in beer) along with the Raku 2.0 Plugin (formerly known as Comma Plugin)

[19:45] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> What I'd actually like is a terminal based debugger, without all the fancy GUI stuff.

[19:46] <lizmat> scullucs have you tried the "repl" subroutine ?

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> doesn't raku have debug? (genuine question - I use say for debuggin)

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I did use the repl once also

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I want to be able to trace through code, setting breakpoints, examining state, stuff like that.

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: can you run the repl via STDERR (ie in a launched Cro server)

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> repl is a good first step in that direction I guess.

[20:40] <disbot1> <antononcube> @Coke "Comma IDE" is a standalone app. What ab5tract worked on is the Raku plug-in for "standard" IntelliJ IDE app.
