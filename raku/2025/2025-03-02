[00:35] <lizmat> s/emiting/emitting/ ?

[00:35] *** swaggboi left
[00:39] <SmokeMachine> Oh! Let me change it!

[00:39] <lizmat> I would turn the ANSI color sequences into readable constants, having them in the code examples is making things more complicated to read then they should

[00:39] <lizmat> be

[00:39] <SmokeMachine> Thanks

[00:40] *** swaggboi joined
[00:40] <lizmat> also: why the "lazy gether" / "take"

[00:40] <lizmat> that feels completely superfluous here

[00:40] <SmokeMachine> to make the events to be created just before emitting...

[00:41] <SmokeMachine> instead of all at once...

[00:42] <lizmat> if you do:  my @events = 

[00:42] <lizmat> and do s/take// on all the next lines, and drop the closing }

[00:42] <lizmat> it should still work ?

[00:44] <SmokeMachine> yes. but it would print the same seconds on all the lines, no?

[00:47] <lizmat> you mean that the "take" is slowing things down?

[00:49] <lizmat> ah, I see what you mean: by making it lazy, you think it would slow down?

[00:49] <lizmat> I think the "sleep 1" in the for @events loop is what is significant there

[00:53] <lizmat> which reminds me....  

[00:53] <lizmat> sleep&

[00:56] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thanks for your help! :)

[12:20] <tbrowder> SmokeMachine: thnx for list rev example. raif showed me a similar method using .pairs instead of .kv

[12:22] <tbrowder> *raiph

[12:29] <tbrowder> so it seems the .antipairs takes the prize, eh?

[12:30] <tbrowder> m: my @a=<1 2 a b>; my %a = @a.antipairs; say %a.gist

[12:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 992f7417b: OUTPUT: ¬´{1 => 0, 2 => 1, a => 2, b => 3}‚ê§¬ª

[12:31] <tbrowder> üëç

[12:31] <tbrowder> very rakuish

[12:33] <lizmat> fwiw, I've been wanting to introduce a .vk for many years now...  it's just that it would percolate into a lot of other areas as well

[12:34] <lizmat> all the places that accept :kv would most likely also need a :vk then as well

[12:46] <tbrowder> hm, a .vk would be more intuitive to me, but i see the prob

[12:50] <lizmat> and once down that road, why not have :ap for antipairs  :-)

[12:50] <tbrowder> if we had .vk at the start, why antipairs?

[12:51] <lizmat> I don't recall atm

[12:51] <lizmat> why antipairs came about

[12:52] *** euandreh joined
[12:52] <tbrowder> :ap is an alias for one thing, :vk alias for 2 things

[12:52] <tbrowder> well, duh, no

[12:53] <tbrowder> i would love :vk and never lose sleep ove lack of :ap

[12:56] <tbrowder> actually i completely forgot about .pairs until raiph reminded me

[12:56] *** nil78 left
[12:56] <tbrowder> but i use .kv all the time

[12:58] *** nil78 joined
[13:00] <tbrowder> but the way i typically use it (.kv -> $k, $v { ... } i don't think about needing .vk

[13:02] <tbrowder> Larry's vision for perl/raku suits my scatter brain perfectly

[13:26] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: morning! Do you think that‚Äôs better now? https://github.com/FCO/Sourcing-FoodDelivery-example/blob/main/first-post.md

[13:29] <lizmat> well, I still think it's a bit too much on the code, and too little explanation: still feels largely as documentation rather than a blog post

[13:29] <lizmat> also: in the examples, what is the use of making the events fully qualified, like: Sourcing::FoodDelivery::Event::OrderAccepted

[13:29] <lizmat> why not just OrderAccepted

[13:29] <SmokeMachine> Do you mean in general or that last bit?

[13:30] <lizmat> well, for instance, each example includes at least "use Sourcing;"

[13:31] <lizmat> you could say at the start of the Food Delivery Example:  all of the examples assume the "Sourcing" module has been loaded

[13:31] <lizmat> then get rid of those lines in the examples

[13:31] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking on if someone was going to look at the repo, that would make it easier to differentiate the parts‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs a very good point‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll make averything on root‚Ä¶

[13:32] <lizmat> well, this is a blog post to get people interested

[13:32] <lizmat> they don't need to know all the nooks and crannies at this point ?

[13:32] <SmokeMachine> That makes sense‚Ä¶

[13:33] <SmokeMachine> Do you think I also shouldn‚Äôt show all the events?

[13:35] <lizmat> I think you can get rid of PaymentFailed   it isn't mentioned anywhere apart from its definition

[13:36] <lizmat> also: isn't this also about encapsulation of events?

[13:37] <lizmat> I mean, aren't PaymentInitiated/Confirmed sub-events of OrderAccepted ?

[13:41] <SmokeMachine> No, they aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ OrderAccept only used them‚Ä¶

[13:42] <SmokeMachine> If you can say the events belongs to someone, it would belong to a Aggregation, not to a Projection‚Ä¶

[13:43] <lizmat> then I don't completely grok your blog yet  :-)

[13:43] <SmokeMachine> Projections are just ‚Äúview‚Äù of a set of events‚Ä¶ Aggregations that own the events‚Ä¶ they have the commands that validate and emit the events‚Ä¶

[13:45] <SmokeMachine> On this first one I‚Äôm only talking about projections‚Ä¶ I thought splitting the concepts of projection, aggregation and process into different posts would make it easier to understand‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt it?

[13:58] <SmokeMachine> I‚Äôm afraid if I make it explicit on the post, I will need to talk about aggregations‚Ä¶ and it would not make sense to split the posts‚Ä¶

[14:01] <SmokeMachine> Unless I make it a bit more explicit by just create a new projections using the same events‚Ä¶ maybe a projection to show all orders by user‚Ä¶

[14:04] <lizmat> hmmm

[14:05] <SmokeMachine> Make sense?

[14:06] <lizmat> well, I would try to reduce the number of events, if at all possible

[14:07] <lizmat> leave out all of the Payment events, as they are not necessary to understand the concept, I'd say

[14:08] <SmokeMachine> I think that makes sense‚Ä¶

[14:13] <SmokeMachine> I‚Äôm trying to do that‚Ä¶ would you mind if I ask your opinion again when I finish it?

[14:18] <lizmat> no, I wouldn't mind

[14:21] *** apac left
[14:49] *** bdju left
[14:53] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: do you think that's a bit better now?

[14:56] <lizmat> PaymentInitiated/Confirmed/Failed are mentioned, but not really explained

[14:58] <lizmat> I feel you could remove them and mention something like "In a real world example, there would be events for initiating payment requests, and handling the results of that event"

[14:58] <SmokeMachine> I thought leaving it there to show projections don't need (and probably shouldn't) use all the events..

[14:59] <lizmat> then you should mention that  :-)

[14:59] <SmokeMachine> makes sense... :)

[14:59] *** bdju joined
[15:05] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: mentioned...

[15:07] <lizmat> ok, sorry if I keep mentioning things, but maybe it would make sense to make a table out of the OrderCreated ... OrderDelivered introductions, now that they're basically a single line of text

[15:08] <SmokeMachine> please, keep mentioning while you see thing I could improve! :)

[15:09] <SmokeMachine> do you mean something like:

[15:09] <SmokeMachine> | event name | description |

[15:09] <SmokeMachine> ?

[15:09] <lizmat> maybe on the printout example, change the times to something less in the middle of the night?   :-)

[15:09] <lizmat> yes

[15:15] <SmokeMachine> yes.. I think the table made it better...

[15:20] <SmokeMachine> done

[15:20] <lizmat> yup

[15:21] <lizmat> I think you can make the header align with |:       the header alignment feels off

[15:21] <lizmat> sorry for the nitpicking  :-)

[15:24] <SmokeMachine> I‚Äôll do that in a min‚Ä¶ sorry, my wife gave me a mission now‚Ä¶ :)

[16:15] <SmokeMachine> Thanks for all your help! :)

[16:15] <lizmat> you're very much welcome

[16:15] <lizmat> so where are you going to post it ?

[16:15] <SmokeMachine> any idea/critic/suggestion about the framework itself?

[16:16] <SmokeMachine> I'm planning to create a wordpress one for that...

[16:16] <lizmat> wordpress generally doesn't like markdown, dev.to does

[16:17] <SmokeMachine> dev.to? I'll take a look...

[16:17] <lizmat> once posted, please do a weekly: with the URL

[16:22] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thanks, I will... do you have any suggestion about the framework itself?

[16:22] <lizmat> not at the moment...  

[16:29] *** yewscion left
[16:31] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: it seems it has no raku highlight... is that correct... do you know if there is any way to allow that?

[16:35] <lizmat> they don't have raku highlight, indeed

[16:35] <lizmat> but WP doesn't either afaik

[16:35] <lizmat> If it's readable, I select Perl highlighting, but only if it doesn't deter from readability

[16:44] <SmokeMachine> if it's ok with no highlight... (still not published): https://dev.to/fco/sourcing-part-1-exploring-event-sourcing-in-raku-4onf-temp-slug-855533?preview=382987efb15e68258f34dde148af3bb9761674350a0ee0ef35a6731a6c6f233df8625b3059d7797db9d4f4868f16dddff90829aa1d4224e1ad96959d

[16:51] <SmokeMachine> I cannot find how to publish that... :(

[16:51] <lizmat> before I tell you how

[16:52] <SmokeMachine> ok... I found it... I must be very dumb...

[16:52] <lizmat> feels like "note "apply OrderCreated";" is debug code left in accidentally ?

[16:52] <SmokeMachine> yeah... that's not needed... I'll remove that

[16:53] <lizmat> making it use Perl highlighting, it's ```perl   I think

[16:53] <lizmat> also, you can only publish when you're editing, oddly enough

[16:54] <lizmat> not when you're previewing

[16:54] <lizmat> also, if you want to make it a series of blog posts, don't forget to set that

[16:55] <SmokeMachine> I did try with ```perl, but it became a worst than with no highlight...

[16:55] <lizmat> ok, then keep it off  :-)

[16:55] <SmokeMachine> oh! is there a option for a set of posts?!

[16:56] <lizmat> yes

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> where?

[16:56] <lizmat> click on the six-sided symbol while you're editing

[16:56] <lizmat> next to the Save Changes

[16:57] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ex09OYgs/image.png

[16:58] <SmokeMachine> should something be here t

[16:58] <SmokeMachine> should something be here?

[16:58] <lizmat> did you publish already ?

[16:58] <lizmat> yes, something should be there

[17:01] <SmokeMachine> I think I did.. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/onuiyqMk/image.png

[17:03] <SmokeMachine> ok.. I think that's like that because I'm using the basic editor... I changed that to the other one and created a new post and then I'm seeing what you described... but I'm not finding how to open the old post on this editor...

[17:05] *** derpydoo left
[17:06] <lizmat> I guess copy-paste ?

[17:07] <SmokeMachine> do you mean delete the original one and create a new one?

[17:07] <lizmat> yes
