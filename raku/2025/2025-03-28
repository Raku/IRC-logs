[18:01] <sdomi> hmm, I'm getting some weird behavior around redirecting raku output to a file/pipe; some writes work OK through stdout, but never arrive in the file. are there any gotchas around this? buffering, or something?

[18:05] *** yewscion joined
[18:10] <ugexe> maybe try something like unbuffer

[18:10] <ugexe> https://linux.die.net/man/1/unbuffer

[18:12] <ugexe> it is also mentioned in https://stackoverflow.com/a/63513815/1772220

[18:35] <Voldenet> >The man page is longer than the program.

[18:35] <Voldenet> :)

[18:40] <sdomi> ugexe: unbuffer is a silly hack, raku should be able to set the buffer settings by itself

[18:41] <sdomi> reading the SO post... gahhh this will be painful

[18:43] <sdomi> okay, it seems that the answer below suggesting `$*OUT.out-buffer` to 0 did exactly what I wanted

[19:22] <sdomi> what is the raku equivalent of the python/bash/(C..?) ~ operator? (sign negation)

[19:24] <sdomi> oh, +^. god that was hard to find

[19:58] <Voldenet> useful page https://docs.raku.org/language/operators

[19:58] <sdomi> i've been there and struggled to find it regardless

[19:58] <sdomi> ^F not -> 150 matches

[20:01] <Voldenet> "negation"

[20:01] <stanrifkin> sdomi: "sign negation"?

[20:02] <sdomi> welp, my bad

[20:02] <stanrifkin> sdomi: ah, seeing it now. 

[20:02] <Voldenet> I've tried to use chatgpt for that question, and it was beautifully wrong

[20:02] <Voldenet> > say ~$x;  # Output: -6 (binary: 1010 -> negation of 101 in 2's complement)

[20:02] <Voldenet> ┐(´～`；)┌

[20:03] <sdomi> if i wanted to see hallucinations i'd seek drugs, i don't need a chatbot for that

[20:03] <sdomi> atrocious.

[20:03] <Voldenet> however, deepseek was right
