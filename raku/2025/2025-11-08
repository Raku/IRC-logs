[22:20] <tbrowder> ?

[22:22] <tbrowder> i'm not familiar with that (or i forgot it). i wasn't trying to be "snarky"

[23:23] <japhb> tbrowder: The Perl 6 effort was initiated by someone throwing mugs to punctuate their unhappiness with the state of Perl 5.

[23:25] <japhb> I wasn't in the room, though I happened to be at the same conference.  My read after the fact was that it came across as "Wow, those are some strong feelings.  Maybe we should do something about that."

[23:25] *** stanrifkin left
[23:37] <lizmat> I was also at that conf

[23:40] <lizmat> but also not in that room at the time of the incident
