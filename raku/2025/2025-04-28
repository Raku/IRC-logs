[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ola /

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is there a better way to say invalid-feedback-class => 'invalid-feedback-class',

[08:54] <lizmat> not that I know of

[08:54] <lizmat> this is usually handled by signatures in my experience

[08:55] <lizmat> m: sub a(:$invalid-feedback-class = 'invalid-feedback-class') { }

[08:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: ( no output )

[08:55] <lizmat> and then you wouldn't need to specify it, unless it was something else

[21:23] <grondilu> not sure what I'm doing wrong with %?RESOURCES.  Everything works fine when I run the code from the repo with either -Ilib or -I. but after zef install if I run the same code without -I, it fails to find the resources.

[21:24] <grondilu> it's that code : https://github.com/grondilu/chess/blob/6a5a8a97219c5421ebbb6fb470117a56aee43539/lib/Kitty.rakumod#L13

[21:25] <grondilu> if I can't make it work I guess I'll save the svg images as constants in a module.

[21:59] <Xliff> grondilu: Are the files listed in META6.json?

[21:59] <grondilu> yes

[21:59] <grondilu> I think so anyway

[22:00] <Xliff> Might want to check to make sure. Looks like you aren't referring to the 'cburnett' directory in your code

[22:01] <grondilu> I am.  It's in the piece-set variable

[22:02] <grondilu> hang on.  somehow it seems I hadn't install the very latest version.

[22:03] <grondilu> ok my bad.  it works now.
