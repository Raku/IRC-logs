[00:39] <Xliff> apogee: NativeCall and NotCurses you say?

[00:39] <disbot3> <apogee> Xliff: üòÆ

[00:39] <Xliff> :D

[00:39] <Xliff> I myself started about 10 days ago.

[00:40] <Xliff> And yes. Low level bindings are quite insane.

[00:40] <disbot3> <apogee> Yeah they are. I've used it in C a lot.

[00:41] <Xliff> The problem you will find is that a lot of notcurses is compiled static inline. There are significant portions that are not accessible by NativeCall without a wrapper.

[00:41] <disbot3> <apogee> Is there any way I can help with yours? I'd rather not reinvent the wheel. üòÑ

[00:41] <Xliff> Hey! I'm all for it.

[00:41] <disbot3> <apogee> Yep I figured this would be the case.

[00:41] <Xliff> Clone a copy of the repo and start filing issues for things you thing are broken or need explanation.

[00:42] <Xliff> I think I have much of the static inline functions covered. Now working on writing tests.

[00:42] <Xliff> 's what I've been working on all day, in fact.

[00:43] <disbot3> <apogee> I'm about to sleep but I've starred it and will take a look tomorrow.

[00:43] <Xliff> Cool deal!

[00:43] <Xliff> I'll be at work in the morning. I'm around most afternoon and nights, though.

[00:43] <Xliff> See you then!

[00:44] <disbot3> <apogee> Sounds good. I'll clone it and start poking.

[00:44] <Xliff> Excellent! ;)

[09:45] <lizmat> apogee re where all(@messages) ~~ LLM::Chat::Conversation::Message

[09:45] <lizmat> that's better written as: @messages.are(LLM::Chat::Conversation::Message)

[09:47] <lizmat> also: LLM::Chat::TokenCounter.get-template-count   can be simplified to:

[09:47] <lizmat> %!template-counts{$template-name} //= $!tokenizer.count(....

[09:48] <lizmat> actually: %!template-counts{$!template.name} //= $!tokenizer.count(....

[09:48] <lizmat> same for get-message-count

[16:22] <tonyo> for anyone working on mi6 or other libs consuming the fez api modules, the old stuff will continue to work for a few months but should be updated and pinned to 100+ (when fez is published)

[18:35] <jdv> is that part of the "role of liz" thing from the summit?

[18:35] <jdv> iirc timo did them before

[18:38] <librasteve_> jdv: i believe so ‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt there but I know that it was felt that Liz‚Äô time better spent on high value stuff

[18:39] <librasteve_> (well stuff that only Liz can do ‚Ä¶)

[18:39] <lizmat> well, it's not that I don't think the Weekly isn't high value

[18:39] <librasteve_> yeah I misspoke

[18:39] <lizmat> but it was getting to be a bit of burden, with diminishing values of -Ofun

[18:40] <lizmat> so I'm really glad that Steve was willing to take it on  :-)

[18:42] <librasteve_> quite disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt just an App::Rak script

[18:43] <jdv> cool
