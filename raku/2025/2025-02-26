[00:07] <tbrowder> [Coke] i‚Äôm not sure i understand yr question, but YNAB (you need a budget) has a great REST API with JSON response, but doco needs to be improved. to me it‚Äôs a lot of trial and error to figure out a decent set of queries to get what i need.

[07:02] <CIAvash> This used to work, has something changed?

[07:13] <melezhik> .tell [Coke]: there is also GRPC/protobug thing - that serialize data in internal binary format but for end client this looks like remote procedure calls which are just native to a language data structures 

[07:13] <tellable6> melezhik, I'll pass your message to [Coke]

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i checked - its not blocked, but I think you need a lot of comments immediately after posting to make it to the the front page

[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think HN -- as a reader base and moderators/adming -- has too many strong pre-judices and one of them is against Raku. üôÇ

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Not big deal for me, BTW. But I notices that certain unpopular posts of mine (say, with 1 star only) bring ‚âà30% of the trafic of corresponding YouTube videos.

[15:57] *** wbooze joined
[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> librasteve: yeah , this is how system works . Sigh üòî‚Ä¶

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> antononcube: makes a sense . Thanks üôè

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Oh, I just seen your HN comment librasteve: thanks üôè a lot

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <holmdunc> IIRC the HN mods don't really like "single issue participants", so if they think all you do is promote some specific thing, and not really participate in the site other wise, they may do something

[16:23] *** yewscion joined
[16:35] *** apac left
[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... that might be, for sure. My conjecture is/was that if posters are posting links to their own work, those are downgraded. A few of my very popular Raku posts became popular because somebody else re-posted/linked them in HN.

[17:06] *** tgt joined
[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i‚Äôve had about three HN hits as a self aggrandizing raku zealot ‚Ä¶ it was pretty random and even if you think you have a doozy, it‚Äôs a big mystery as to what gets taken up

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i keep trying because it seems to me that the more people see raku out there, the less of a wild assed thing it will seem
