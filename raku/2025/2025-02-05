[14:07] <melezhik> tbrowder: sure, could please elaborate on your Sparky question ?

[14:07] <melezhik> could -> could you

[14:09] <melezhik> in other words, what exactly are you going to do with sparky ...

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezhik: I cant answer for tbrowder, but I wonder if sparky can do some CICD automation for my use cases - currently I use GitHub Actions to build and push some Dockerfiles to Docker hub for example ... https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Dockerfiles ... can it do that, if so where can I find a getting started recipe?

[14:30] <melezhik> librasteve: I see

[14:32] <melezhik> librasteve: Sparky definitely do that, before me start pointing any directions, may I ask you, you considering Sparky as self hosted (on your infrastructure) or as a service - what is available via http://sparky.sparrowhub.io instance ? 

[14:36] <melezhik> in any case a cookbook will be pretty much the same, it's just with self-hosted you'll gain more control and flexibility , but you'll need to host sparky yourself, not a bug deal though 

[14:37] <melezhik> public service option is less hassle , but in that case there is burden of maintaining users repos on my - sparky.sparrowhub.io instance  ...

[15:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I should make a "study" across all the models I can access what do they think about "LLM and Raku."

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Grok, unfortunately, did not give me access to their API. (Maybe their policy has changed, I have to check / re-apply.)

[17:12] <tbrowder> melezhik: i'm talking about basic things i have to do to manage remote debian servers: adding a new one, setting up ssh properly, adding users, adding new services, managing apache web servers, dns, upgrading raku and modules, etc. i think yr system can do most of that, if not all. is there some single config file or directory where i can define a template from which to do that for all servers? can i do most periodic things with a 

[17:12] <tbrowder> single cron job on master server? etc.

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezhik: ah - I just copiued a cookbook - guess dont need an emulator - thanks!

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> OK - don't worry about the dockerfile example too much (it is already retty much working so I do not have any tuits to rebuild it - I'll just tune in to what you have for Tom Browder and see if I can make sense fo that

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbrowder: fwiw I have nade two simple AWS only tools - https://github.com/librasteve/raku-CLI-AWS-EC2-Simple to manage a set of EC2 instances and https://github.com/librasteve/raku-CLI-Wordpress to install and run WP + nginx + certs + db remotely - you are welcome to try them ... I am thinking of a new one (with some common features with the WP one) but to install and run Cro + nginx + db remotely

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> however, I am also looking at some simple use cases with https://opentofu.org

[19:44] <melezhik> oh, that was meant for tbrowder: sorry

[19:44] <melezhik> anyways )

[19:45] <melezhik> so, yes. I don't think for that case Sparky even required, Sparrowdo which is in nutshell just a ssh Sparrow tasks runners should be enough 

[19:46] <melezhik> https://sparrowdo.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/sparrowdo-core-dsl/ this post is quite old, but still actual ...

[19:47] <melezhik> Sparky is in nutshell is just ( well not exactly ) a web UI for sparrowdo, one can start with Sparrowdo and if they require web UI they may migrate to Sparky which is quite easy

[19:48] <melezhik> as for template sort of project, let me actually create a repo with some easy to start stuff, and you might start with it

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: afaiui %() for Hash is the equivalent to [] for Array since {} cannot always be guaranteed to provide a Hash instead of a Block ... although I have never had an issue with {} ... so not entirely suprising that %() -> Hash and @() -> Map is inconsistent

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that said I think that this is good

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well I guess I can do that, but my dumb brain thinks it should be OK to assign an Array [] to an Array @ (which works despite the supercilious []) and it should also be OK to assign a Hash {}  to a Hash % (which requires me to drop the superfluous {})
