[15:52] <disbot3> <librasteve> @simon_sibl well, you need to assemble a website using site() and to call .serve on it which you do ‚Ä¶ the form SITE() is export is a bit of a throwback to before I added the .serve method when I had a single service.raku that always called SITE from a context that use Cro::Router ‚Ä¶ so really no need for SITE (in caps) anywhere. Passing parameter with .serve is as intended and nothing stuck out around self.HTML ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll

[15:52] <disbot3> likely work just to return self since the HTML is called automatically by the parent component. But honestly I‚Äôm not really a stickler for a particular style.

[16:32] <disbot3> <melezhik.> What‚Äôs is status supporting Rakudo binaries for arm / risk-v ? Quoting some people trying to use Spraky those platforms ‚ÄúUpdate... I remember I started the process of Sparrow/Sparky on Aarch64 and Risc-V but I couldn't remember how far I got... so I just did a refresher. Neither have pre-built RPM repos. Thus I started the more manual way for doing the install. For Aarch64 I had this issue:  $ rakubrew download moar-2025.02

[16:32] <disbot3> Couldn't find a precomp release for OS: "linux", architecture: "arm64", version: "2025.02" You can try building yourself. Use the `rakubrew build` command to do so.   and Risc-V I had this issue:  $ rakubrew download moar-2025.02 Couldn't detect system architecture. Current arch is: riscv64-linux-thread-multi Current uname -a is: Linux buildroot 6.12.0-55.34.1.el10_0.riscv64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Sep 26 00:36:46 UTC 2025 riscv64

[16:32] <disbot3> GNU/Linux   I figured I would have more luck with Aarch64 so I started down the road to building but I haven't yet got a solution.‚Äù

[19:23] <[Coke]> (why failing) it is telling you - you said you were getting a List, but got a Seq instead. Are you sure you need a list?

[19:23] *** melezhik left
[19:23] <[Coke]> sorry, that last list should also be List.

[19:23] <tbrowder> i want a List

[19:24] <tbrowder> shouldn't it be coerced to a List automagically?

[19:24] <[Coke]> also, you can probably use ```sort: +*``` - shorter.

[19:24] <[Coke]> No, why would it?

[19:25] <tbrowder> wel, why is it a Seq?

[19:26] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_sort

[19:26] <[Coke]> sort returns a Seq

[19:27] <Voldenet> "ChatGPT says the .List is not required" - chatgpt says many things :D

[19:27] <[Coke]> you're using the result of the sort as your return value, so you get a Seq.

[19:28] <disbot3> <nahita3882> you can do List() in the signature to have the conversion done for you

[19:28] <Voldenet> huh, you can do that on return type? :O

[19:28] <Voldenet> m: use Test; my  $s="10 1"; sub Foo(Str $s ‚Äì> List()) { my @ints = $s.words.map({ .Int }); @ints.unique.sort({ $^a <=> $^b }).List }; my @ints = Foo($s); .say for @ints;

[19:28] <Voldenet> wow that's convenient

[19:30] <disbot3> <nahita3882> by the way, .sort must be constructing some sort of a List internally and returning a Seq out of it

[19:31] <disbot3> <nahita3882> so it could have been made to return a List but perhaps there's a reason for Seq

[19:33] <tbrowder> well sort has gotten more powerful/confusing over the years fer sure. i do vaguely remember the --> List() "'trick" shown here some time ago

[19:36] <[Coke]> could be using some other iterable. and maybe you're trying to sort an infinite list, or a supply, or...

[19:36] <tbrowder> Voldenet, ref ChatGPT, yes, i have caught errors several times before, and argued about this case and wanted to make sure what is the correct output

[19:38] <tbrowder> normally "he" admits it when caught in an error, but this time was quite insistent on it should be a List without .List

[19:38] <disbot3> <librasteve> took me a while to realise that most listy routines in Raku return a Seq - in other words, Raku tries hard to be lazy wherever possible

[19:39] <tbrowder> good point, and i'm afraid i am weak-brained on Seq types

[19:39] <disbot3> <librasteve> @nahita3882 , of course, is correct so in that case there is no performance gain from the Seq

[19:41] <tbrowder> while i have asking for help, about what year did sort, map, and grep get simplified syntax without needing the braces inside parens?

[19:43] <disbot3> <librasteve> I think the method call syntax xxx.grep: /it/ has been around as long as Raku ... happy to stand corrected

[19:45] <tbrowder> prb right, but i have always avoided.grep until getting help from lizmat or, ahem, ChatGPT

[19:46] <tbrowder> lots learned to day, thanks all

[20:08] <Voldenet> nahita3882: the reason is obvious - ideally you'd want to return abstract structures everywhere

[20:09] <Voldenet> returning plain CArray may seem fast, but if someone does .sort(‚Ä¶).head(1) then obviously you can skip all the sorting

[20:10] <Voldenet> also, (1..10).sort will be no-op

[20:12] <tbrowder> but revisiting the "--> List()" syntax, doesn't that seem like a hack that should be fixed?

[20:12] <Voldenet> it's a bit like accepting List(), it's very convenient if you actually want to return or consume a list

[20:15] <tbrowder> i don't understand. is "--> SomeType()" used in other cases?

[20:16] <disbot3> <librasteve> I use it here https://harcstack.org

[20:16] <disbot3> <librasteve> method hx-increment(--> Hash()) {

[20:17] <disbot3> <librasteve> otherwise I have to put {{...}} or {%(...)}

[20:19] <disbot3> <librasteve> which wastes two lines

[20:28] <tbrowder> i think i see that, but i don't quite see the need in the List problem case...unless as y'all said Raku wants to be Lazy so you have to be specific. i will try it without a return type in my real code and see  what happens.

[20:32] <[Coke]> I think the takeaway is that you can also be lazy here - maybe you just need an Iterable, not a List

[20:41] <tbrowder> ok, i do want a List and i prefer the .List syntax and all this proves the beauty of  Raku/Perl and Larry's  genius in more than one way to do it!

[20:42] <disbot3> <librasteve> amen to that

[20:49] <tbrowder> bye for now, it's almost "tea" time... ;-)
