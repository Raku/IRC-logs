[08:14] <ab5tract> Leftward feed is mostly a hangover from Perl 5’s implementation of map/grep

[08:15] <ab5tract> But I remember forward/reverse feed, not leftward/rightward

[08:16] <ab5tract> There are also unimplemented feed operators ==>> and <<==

[08:17] <ab5tract> I can’t recall what they are meant to do at the moment

[11:08] <ab5tract> Ok, interesting

[11:09] <ab5tract> If there weren’t hundreds of open tickets for RakuAST, I’d implement it :)

[17:53] <[Coke]> is this a zef issue, a rakubrew issue, or a rakudo issue?

[18:34] <notable6> librasteve_, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2025-11-10T18:34:51Z”

[18:39] <ugexe> [Coke]: rakudo issue. usually the wrapper is kept if another version of the distribution is installed (since they are shared by all installed versions) but it wouldnt surprise me if it didnt also check that the other distributions included that script

[18:40] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/f7ce946e11fc587f980e54c263d75282cbbed18d/src/core.c/CompUnit/Repository/Installation.rakumod#L466

[18:41] <ugexe> that lines seems wrong, because i would expect .elems to always be at least 1 there since the distribution being uninstalled would represent at least one

[18:45] <ugexe> i might be wrong though. i think the original intention would be that the deletion of the short name that is done in an earlier step would prevent the dist from being in the list from self.files(...)

[18:53] <ugexe> raku -e 'my $repo = CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry.repository-for-name("site"); my $dist = $repo.candidates("Hilite::Simple", :ver(v0.0.2)).head; $repo.uninstall($dist);'

[18:53] <ugexe> i havent tested, but that probably reproduces it once you have both versions installed

[20:20] <Voldenet> in the weekly there's that code block, but font is quite unreadable on my 4k screen

[20:20] <Voldenet> simply "monospace" is a lot more readable

[20:20] <lizmat> the Tips & Tricks one ?

[20:20] <Voldenet> yeah

[20:20] <lizmat> librasteve_ ^^

[20:21] <Voldenet> courier font: https://i.imgur.com/6bVenLW.png "monospace": https://i.imgur.com/Llg0nqe.png

[20:22] <Voldenet> if you're not on 4k screen, imagine it being twice smaller

[20:22] <Voldenet> or scale down to 50%

[20:25] <lizmat> sadly, that code bit is HTML gobbledegook, that's been generated...   and librasteve_ is the one who wrote that    and they're currently not online

[20:25] <lizmat> so I hope they'll see this and figure it out  :-)

[20:26] * lizmat calls it a day&

[20:26] <Voldenet> fwiw the actual font used as monospace is consolas in case of this image

[20:28] <Voldenet> and in fact, you can change that font in firefox options

[21:22] <disbot1> <librasteve> Voldenet: thanks for the heads up on the small font on 4k screen … I would like to fix this … the intent is to match the raku highlighting on raku.org … does that have the same font size issue? otherwise there is a Wordpress style that is overloading the size I guess

[21:24] <disbot1> <antononcube> "Hilite::Simple" should have style or mode selection. (E.g. "dark-mode", "solarized", "vamp")

[21:29] <disbot1> <librasteve> fwiw I did about 5 iterations of the colour map … short term I wanted to avoid wiring the Hilite module to Air::Base::Widget::LightDark since that’s a tight corner so I hand picked a default map that works well in both modes

[21:30] <disbot1> <antononcube> I will make an LLM prompt for highiliting that might help you. (Or not...) 🙂

[21:31] <disbot1> <librasteve> excellent … colour map is just a hash in Simple.rakumod so is trivial to make it a parameter

[23:28] <Voldenet> simply `font-family: monospace;` should work fine, I'm not sure why especially "Courier New" looks like extra-thin version of the otherwise nice font
