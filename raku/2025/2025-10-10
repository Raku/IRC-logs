[00:32] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> Any idea for this ? I am really stuck 🥲

[00:33] <[Coke]> simon do you have a code snippet we can look at?

[00:37] <[Coke]> if you're not dealing with it as binary, it needs more bytes to make sure it can process certain encodings.

[00:37] <[Coke]> e.g "is this followed by a combiner?"

[01:26] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> Debian torrent file basically

[01:27] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> It reads 2 bytes too much at the end, eating the “8:” that will start the url key in the dictionary

[05:17] <Voldenet> in general raku likes whitespace very much and requires it in many places

[05:18] <Voldenet> but also it replaces () with spaces, so effectively there's hardly any reason why would you use () in the first place

[05:19] <Voldenet> instead of `if($x<1)` you can do `if $x < 1`

[05:23] <Voldenet> in perl it was allowed, but it was never good style anyway

[05:24] <Voldenet> because it's harder to quickly see what's going on

[05:38] <disbot5> <frostcod> m: my $x = 5; if ($x < 1) { say "x < 1" } else { say "x > 1" }

[07:03] <Voldenet> any bool expression can be wrapped into () so it's as valid as `if ((((($x < 1)))))`, just very redundant

[07:04] <Voldenet> any expression actually

[07:37] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> actually it is 3 bytes too much it eats the e that ends the dictionary, the 8: that starts the next key of the parent dictionary..

[08:26] <librasteve_> johnjaye: the best way for me to understand the need for parens () in raku is that they are purely there for disambiguation

[08:27] <librasteve_> you know if you want to say (5+3) *2 [16] instead of 5+3*2 [11]

[08:28] <librasteve_> raku is very consistent, so to make a List you can go my $l = 1,2,3; which is the same as my $l = (1,2,3); … here the “,” comma is doing duty as the list making operator

[08:39] <johnjaye> right but i'm asking what if($x<1) parses as

[08:39] <johnjaye> i believe it gave an error since if isn't a function

[08:40] <johnjaye> and I saw someone define if as a function somewhere in the source tree

[08:42] <johnjaye> actually i re-ran it and it actually is an error. it directly says so

[08:42] <Voldenet> simon_sibl: I'm quite sure the problem is with encoding - I've tried replacing all the 62640 bytes of "pieces" with "a" and then url-list was parsed properly

[08:43] <johnjaye> i'm not used to error messages being useful and actually also suggesting what I can do to fix it.

[08:43] *** arkiuat joined
[08:47] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> but except using latin-1 what else could I try to make it work ? I tried another torrent file and it worked, so even with raw bytes it works sometimes, there must be something weird within the bytes of the debian file that messes with the grammar somehow

[08:48] *** arkiuat left
[09:07] <disbot5> <librasteve> johnjaye: oh - lol

[09:10] *** arkiuat joined
[09:14] *** arkiuat left
[09:23] <Voldenet> I don't know if you can use raku grammars for binary files safely anyhow, `0d0a` is the sequence that seems to break stuff

[09:24] <Voldenet> oh wow, right, 0d0a is CRLF

[09:24] <Voldenet> what a /coincidence/ init

[09:24] <disbot5> <librasteve> windoze

[09:24] <Voldenet> but actually it's all on linux

[09:24] <Voldenet> and it's a debian.torrent file

[09:24] <Voldenet> nothing windows here!

[09:24] <disbot5> <librasteve> yeah but maybe the protocol is windows insprired

[09:25] <Voldenet> it's a binary blob containing hashes

[09:25] <Voldenet> I'm betting that it just happens that raku somehow interprets it in a grammar

[09:25] <Voldenet> or in encoding

[09:25] <Voldenet> and gobbles bytes

[09:26] <disbot5> <librasteve> wonders if vertical whitespace has a role -- iirc ^^ $$ (as opposed to ^ $) ignores it -- I have no clue how that plays with binary

[09:36] <Voldenet> that's the problem reduced to one-liner

[09:36] <Voldenet> so no debian.torrent file is needed :D

[15:22] <AspiringCoder> Okay guys, quick question: First Programming Language - Python, or Raku? Go!

[15:26] <stanrifkin> Never programmed before?

[15:27] <stanrifkin> none of those I would say

[15:31] <AspiringCoder> Oh.

[15:32] <arkiuat> Forth

[15:32] <AspiringCoder> I thought the best programming language was the most popular one - more resources, more people willing to help you, more people that have encountered your issues, etc.

[15:32] <arkiuat> No, that's the best second programming language

[15:32] <arkiuat> Raku is the best last programming language

[15:33] <arkiuat> Forth is the best first programming language

[15:33] <AspiringCoder> Ah, sorry. I misspoke. "I thought the best programming language FOR BEGINNERS..." For beginners.

[15:34] <arkiuat> oh, what's the difference? I mean, that's what I meant by "best first"

[15:34] <AspiringCoder> Oh right!

[15:34] <arkiuat> I remember back when people used to think that Logo was the best first programming language, or even (yuck) Basic

[15:35] <stanrifkin> AspiringCoder: I depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to play around and building stuff. Or you want to learn strong fundamentals. 

[15:36] <AspiringCoder> Strong fundamentals is what I'm looking for.

[15:36] <stanrifkin> This is an algorithm book using C, http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html

[15:36] <stanrifkin> yeah, ^ that one then

[15:36] <arkiuat> there are other folks who think that Scheme is the best first programming language

[15:37] *** apogee_ntv left
[15:37] <stanrifkin> at the school here they teach Standard ML and Pascal

[15:38] <stanrifkin> But for me it were algorithms which interested me the most. Programming language theory wasn't.

[15:38] <arkiuat> I thought Pascal had died out

[15:39] <stanrifkin> FreePascal is going strong

[15:39] <stanrifkin> and looking here, https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

[15:39] <[Coke]> I learned some pascal back in high school in the late 80s, iirc.

[15:39] <stanrifkin> Delphi, Ada still very strong

[15:39] <arkiuat> well, so is Cobol

[15:39] <stanrifkin> I use Ada btw too

[15:40] <[Coke]> (but basic first in the early 80s)

[15:40] <AspiringCoder> Are you being sincere when you recommend Forth as the best first language? I know of Forth. I know it's not popular. I know it's obscure.

[15:40] <stanrifkin> I never used Forth

[15:40] <arkiuat> oh, it's very popular for embedded programming with limited resources, especially limited memory resources. It's still widely used in bootup ROMs

[15:40] <stanrifkin> reminded me always of HP calculator stuff

[15:41] <arkiuat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware

[15:42] *** guifa_ left
[15:43] <AspiringCoder> stanrifkin: Regarding that algorithm book, do you recommend C as a first language then?

[15:43] <stanrifkin> yes, why not

[15:46] <[Coke]> I would definitely not recommend c as a first language.

[15:46] *** guifa joined
[15:46] <[Coke]> ... maybe back in the 90s.

[15:46] <arkiuat> but if you want to stay very far away from hardware, never get involved with the highly lucrative business of developing drivers for new devices, etc, then maybe you should steer clear of Forth. But it's far more flexible in allowing to use the available hardware resources than any other commonly used language

[15:47] <[Coke]> How many people are writing code specifically to develop drivers?

[15:47] <arkiuat> yeah, it's probably not the largest market anymore. Still lucrative though.

[15:47] <[Coke]> That's more of a "here's a niche career path that you could explore" vs. "good intro", IMO

[15:48] <[Coke]> (lucrative) always a plus

[15:49] <arkiuat> but when people ask me for a good first programming language, I'm thinking learning opportunities, and Forth has a bunch that no other widely available language offers

[15:49] <arkiuat> job market considerations might enter when selecting a second language to learn

[15:50] <stanrifkin> AspiringCoder: Else I recommend Perl then. The "Learning Perl" book is quite nice to work through.

[15:53] <arkiuat> What would you recommend, [Coke]?

[15:53] <disbot6> <antononcube> Python is good first programming language, but there is great risk to be damaged for life by it. (As a programmer.)

[15:55] <[Coke]> I'm old enough that I wouldn't trust my opinion on current best languages to start with. I'm partial to Raku, but that's kind of self selecting

[15:55] <arkiuat> I'm extremely partial to Raku myself, but I'm wary of recommending it as a first language. Perl too for that matter, even though that was my absolute favorite for decades.

[15:56] <[Coke]> mmm, I loved perl back in the day, same.

[15:57] <arkiuat> but yeah, I should disqualify myself from this question on the basis of age, as you say

[15:57] <[Coke]> (I probably wrote my first code in the 1970s)

[15:58] <arkiuat> my first code that shipped in a product went out in 1991 or 1992, I think. I can't remember my first MS-DOS batch file, probably the '80s sometime

[15:59] <AspiringCoder> Alright, I'll put this topic to rest. I've decided to make C my first language, as I already have a book on it.

[15:59] <arkiuat> oh and in 1985 I was programming whatever the PRIMOS equivalent of shell programming was. PRIMOS was a minicomputer OS that got killed off by micros

[16:00] <arkiuat> I don't even remember what they called the shell language. PRIMOS was originally implemented in Fortran, because academics, and then later they rewrote it in a dialect of PL/1. Very weird stuff.

[16:01] <stanrifkin> AspiringCoder: good choice

[16:01] <ds7832> AspiringCoder: if you redecide and do want to learn Raku as the first language, there's a freely available O'Reilly book  written with just that perspective in mind: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/

[16:49] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @ds7832 yea i mean that module. i added some behavior last night to that module so that None plays with definiteness handling constructs lile with, without and //

[16:50] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> One of the things I feel like is that I kind of agree with Definitely's premise that explicitly marking a function and restricting it to return an Optional type or Result type has its uses

[16:51] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> But if there was a way to make it more idiomatic in Raku that would be really goo

[16:57] <ds7832> aruniecrisps: So the question is figuring out what better syntax & semantics for that should look like, right? (I don't have concrete ideas myself, but since the Maybe is probably inspired by Haskell, I presume you'll want to consider that one closely

[16:59] <ds7832> On the later question of implementation: Incidentally, I've just read this 2019 post by Damian Conway on how to extend existing language constructs. Good chance it's going to be useful at some point or another: https://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/09/itchscratch.html

[17:08] <ds7832> Syntax-wise, it seems that when a function's return type is specified as Maybe or Maybe[Type], one could (at least in theory) do away with any explicit something() in the block.

[21:26] <ds7832> johnjaye: This stack is probably the most popular: https://harcstack.org/

[21:28] <ds7832> librasteve writes frequent blog posts about it: https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2025/03/30/the-harc-stack/ - don't know if he's online right now

[21:28] <ds7832> I don't really know much about these tools, but it probably makes sense to start with Cro

[21:32] <ds7832> https://cro.raku.org/

[21:38] <ds7832> For databases, as far as SQL is concerned: You can either write inline SQL queries with this module (https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/Slang::SQL). There are also one or two modules that provide abstraction (https://raku.land/?q=sql), in particular SQL::Abstract

[21:41] <ds7832> but its functionality does't look very extensive. The one offering the most functionality is probably Red, part of the aforementioned hArc stack: https://github.com/FCO/Red

[21:45] <SmokeMachine> https://fco.github.io/Red/

[21:45] <SmokeMachine> I like Red... :)

[23:46] <[Coke]> Any thoughts on https://github.com/skaji/mi6/issues/188 ? (have the thing that validates a module and deploy it be more strict about 'use' and 'depends')

[23:48] <[Coke]> Any preferences folks have for a DB that is OSS and easy to use from raku on (say) ubuntu?

[23:49] <[Coke]> Although now that I've said that, I kind of want the data to be in a git repo.

[23:50] <[Coke]> eh, we can do an export from the DB if we want to save a backup in git. nevermind

[23:51] <[Coke]> .ask tbrowder - can you followup on https://github.com/Raku/Blin/issues/42 ?

[23:51] <tellable6> [Coke], I'll pass your message to tbrowder
