[21:59] <tellable6> 2025-03-30T13:23:15Z #raku <patrickb> guifa: I've reviewed https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1882

[21:59] <grondilu> I'm trying the --profile option.  The give html page only shows templates for numeric value.  It seems that it's calculating them.  Is it normal that it takes time?

[21:59] <guifa> patrickb: whoa that's awesome

[22:00] <guifa> I'll take a look at it

[22:00] <guifa> actually flows directly into a question for lizmat and others -- was asked by TPRC folks to choose between two talks

[22:01] <guifa> option A - discuss ways to contribute to Raku (bug reports, documentation, answer Qs on reddit/stack/etc, do core work, write fundamental modules, etc etc)

[22:02] <guifa> option B -  peeling back the onion to add multicast (showing each step of the process and why poking at core isn't as scary as one thinks, but the thoughts for each one)

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @guifa You can set up a voting post on Reddit. (If you want that kind of feedback for the two options.)
