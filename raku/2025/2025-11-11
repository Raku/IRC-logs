[09:59] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: would it be feasible to see a version of the mug throw -Ofun image, but with camelia colors? :)

[09:59] *** arkiuat left
[10:02] <SmokeMachine> I have tried something like this, but I don’t think it looks good, but I’ll keep trying… https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/8XMMjzje/1762855318.JPG

[10:08] <SmokeMachine> I like this first one better, but I didn’t like it to be so close to the floor, then I tried the 2nd one, but it didn’t remove the floor and Camélia got worst…

[10:08] <ab5tract> the mug looks great in #1 but the rainbow has too many colors

[10:22] <SmokeMachine> I tried again from the beginning, and got this that I do not dislike, but that’s too cartoonish… https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/X3bPkynl/1762856528.JPG

[10:23] <SmokeMachine> Then I tried again and got the one that I think is the best one unless for changing Camélia with a generic butterfly https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GdoiyX65/1762856614.JPG

[10:29] *** arkiuat joined
[10:31] <ab5tract> that one is really cool, so of course it has to be the one that ruins camelia :/

[10:31] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine: maybe with an explicit list of the hex values for the colors?

[10:32] <ab5tract> on another topic, SmokeMachine: have you had a chance to play with R#5917?

[10:32] <linkable6> R#5917 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5917 New andthen/orelse for 6.e

[10:34] *** arkiuat left
[10:36] <SmokeMachine> ab5tract: I did at that time, and that was working as I think it should. Now I see there was some more changes… I’ll try to take another look later today, but please do not wait for me

[10:36] <ab5tract> ok, no worries. 

[10:37] <ab5tract> If it was working for you that's good enough for me

[15:56] <disbot1> <librasteve> Voldenet: I have done some checking on the small font - it seems that the Wordpress.com theme we use is applying the small 0.85em size and font choice to all pre tags ... I have tried not using pre tags but that looks crap. I can probably hardwire the pre font size in Hilite::Simple (or have it as an option with default 1em). Since I do not have a 4k, please can you tell me the smallest comfortable font-size - and also I can

[15:56] <disbot1> set the font family as you say... so please respond here and I will try to get it to work in a nicer way going forward. (PS with this week we needed a small font to squeeze in all the graph bars, so probably wont change what's already done)

[20:05] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> In addition to some of the startup work I'm doing using Raku/Cro/Daisy/HARC I've also created a repository for a new Slang i'm creating: Slang::Resembling

[20:07] *** melezhik_ left
[20:07] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> basically the concept is this, it's a when clause that takes a pointy block to destructure the topic:   my Book $b = Book.new(author => 'Vickram');  given $b {     resembling -> Book $ (:$author) {         ...     } } 

[20:35] * [Coke] wonders why there is Serialize-Naive and Serialize::Naive

[20:36] <Voldenet> >PS with this week we needed a small font to squeeze in all the graph bars

[20:36] <Voldenet> no worries, they don't fit anyway :D

[20:38] *** melezhik left
[20:38] <Voldenet> to fit them you'd have to do `overflow-x: auto` on pre tag (that's done already) and disable `white-space: pre-wrap` so that it's in one line, otherwise it simply won't work in a lot of scenarios

[20:49] <ab5tract> aruniecrisps: this looks pretty cool!

[21:20] <disbot1> <nahita3882> cool stuff indeed, i remember someone asking about this

[21:20] <disbot1> <nahita3882> do we get to destructure Hashes as well? JS style

[21:21] <disbot1> <nahita3882> also maybe S/resembling/case/? because laziness to type less
