[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Certain graph properties, like, edge-count and vertex-count, can be computed for "symbolic" graphs. For example, Graph::Complete.new($n).edge-count can produce a function for $n if $n is undefined (or Whatever.) So, couple of questions related to this:

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 1) Should these symbolic graphs be in a separate namespace, for example, Graph::Symbolic::Complete or Graph::Symbolic::Star? The other way araound, e.g. Graph::Complete::Symbolic etc. ? Maybe it is better to have just one class that handles both the numeric and symbolic cases.

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> 2) Since, there is no "stable" symbolic implementation in Raku, should these symbolic properties return pure functions or code? (Maybe, both.) Are there any other options?

[19:11] <[Coke]> Huh. someone sent me an email asking if I would sell them github.com/coke

[19:11] <[Coke]> (and it's some company that might actually have some money)

[19:13] <timo> do it if it's really really really really really really really much money

[19:14] <[Coke]> For sure, I asked them what terms they were considering. :)
