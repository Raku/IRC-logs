[21:01] <tbrowder> librasteve showed me how to get a list of M random elements from a set of N elements. is there some clever way to make that "random" list repeatable? maybe by restting srand?

[21:01] <tbrowder> *resetting

[21:04] <tbrowder> yes, srand is the key

[21:05] *** wbooze left
[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: srand(1234); say (^100).pick(4);

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> you had it on the nail

[21:11] <tbrowder> thanks! that's what i need fer sure

[21:24] <tbrowder> hm, when i use it in a loop, it does weird things. first val is diff, but later ones are the same. still experimenting...

[21:31] <tbrowder> let's see if i can demo...

[21:36] <tbrowder> trimmimg down my use case...

[21:37] <tbrowder> back in a bit...

[21:48] <tbrowder> m: my $n = 10; my @u = 1..5; for 0..2 { say(srand(5); @u.roll($n)) }

[21:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar d02dd8e36: OUTPUT: «(5)((2 4 2 1 5 3 5 3 1 1))␤(5)((5 4 3 1 4 4 4 3 4 3))␤(5)((5 4 3 1 4 4 4 3 4 3))␤»

[21:49] <tbrowder> weird ^^ see first is diff, others the same

[21:52] <[Coke]> I believe that's an issue with roll.

[21:52] <[Coke]> m: my $n = 10; my @u = 1..5; for 0..2 { say(srand(5); say 10.rand }

[21:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d02dd8e36: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in argument list; couldn't find final ')' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 5; for 0..2 { say(srand(5); say 10.rand <HERE>}␤    expecting any of:␤    …»

[21:53] <[Coke]> m: my $n = 10; my @u = 1..5; for 0..2 { say(srand(5); 10.rand) }

[21:53] <[Coke]> m: BEGIN srand(5); my $n = 10; my @u = 1..5; for 0..2 { say(srand(5); 10.rand) }

[21:53] <tbrowder> i can just ignore the first, but the algo must be wrong somehow. coke i tried using rand an got same results

[21:53] <[Coke]> But BEGIN to present the srand and roll was still giving different answers on the first roll through.

[21:54] <[Coke]> "preset"

[21:54] <tbrowder> obviously i didn't use rand correctly

[21:55] *** maylay left
[21:55] <tbrowder> so, an issue?

[21:56] <tbrowder> did you try INIT block

[21:57] *** maylay joined
[21:57] <[Coke]> only tried the BEGIN (which still had the wrong answer) and then the rand - which with begin worked.

[21:58] <[Coke]> You shouldn't need a BEGIN, and I don't see anything obvious in 'method roll' in List that would cause that.

[21:58] <[Coke]> I don't think your code is wrong, smells like a bug

[21:58] <tbrowder> INIT didn't work either

[21:58] *** Guest60 joined
[21:59] <tbrowder> i'm pretty sure i've use srand before with success, maybe in roast.

[22:00] <tbrowder> but probably not with roll...

[22:01] <Guest60> Long time perl user. New project, like to use Raku.  Require the ability to compile distributable AMD64 binaries for window 10/11.  Have a test OO project built. Can somebody refer me to a good reference for making binaries?

[22:02] <[Coke]> I'm not sure such a reference exists.

[22:03] <[Coke]> tbrowder: I tried removing the BEGIN and using MVM_DISABLE_JIT and MVM_DISABLE_SPESH with no help

[22:03] <[Coke]> er, SPESH_DISABLE and and JIT_DISABLE

[22:11] <tbrowder> Guest60: such a project sounds like a good thing to spread raku to windows ppl!

[22:28] <Guest60> tbrowder: It was always a big hurdle for perl. XS was no fun. I just want UI and math to both be easy in one language, and to not have to support OS level dependency hell issues post-install. I was kinda hoping that was the direction that Raku was going in when I saw nativecall().

[22:53] <lizmat> I understand patrickb has been working on Windows executables for scripts

[22:59] *** sena_kun left
[23:04] *** lichtkind left
[23:10] <[Coke]> nativecall is for calling out to C, not for bundling into an executable.

[23:11] <[Coke]> so if you already have some C that is buildable on your target platform, you can install rakudo and have some raku code that calls out to it.
