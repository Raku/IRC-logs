[13:47] <tbrowder> hi, tell me again pls where is IRC for discussing rakudoc v2?

[13:47] *** dawids_ joined
[13:47] <lizmat> I don't think there's a specific channel for that, other than #raku-doc perhaps ?

[13:48] *** dawids_ left
[13:51] <tbrowder> ok

[13:59] <tbrowder> i know in the original discussion i mentioned we need a directive for a page break for rakudod input to be converted to a paper product. in the current definition i don't see anything that does that. i know for my own purposes i can preprocess input and produce a list of rakudoc inputs but that sounds too ad hoc.

[14:00] <tbrowder> and a pain

[14:01] <tbrowder> my immediate goal is too produce a pdf slide deck for presentations

[14:02] <lizmat> I suggest making an issue for it 

[14:02] <lizmat> ?

[14:02] <tbrowder> ok, will do

[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks!

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezhik: since you wrote the cookbook, I have read into sparrowdo some more - in fact it seems like I already rebuilt a chunk of sparrowdo features (remote install over SSH) in a couple of my modules - that will teach me to read more and hopefully write less - my next work in this area will be to clone https://github.com/librasteve/raku-CLI-Wordpress, but to implement for Cro - and for that I have pencilled in

[16:29] <discord-raku-bot> (mentally) to replace the remote SSH bits with sparrowdo and nginx reverse proxy with caddy

[16:29] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I assume this question has been asked before: Are there any plans to make Raku's gcd work on rational numbers and complex numbers? (Similarly, for lcm.)

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> melezhik: that will take me some time to get to (I guess a couple of months at this rate) so please be patient

[16:31] <tellable6> librasteve, I'll pass your message to melezhik

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube - gcd on Complex numbers --- wtf is that

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> üôÇ Easy: gcd-gaussian-integers(-3 + 2i, 10 + 15i) == -3+2i .

[16:34] *** jpn left
[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> m: say (10 + 15i) / (-3 + 2i);

[16:34] <evalable6> antononcube, rakudo-moar 138ba249e: OUTPUT: ¬´0-5i‚ê§¬ª

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  0-5i 

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> m: say (10 + 15i) / (2 + 3i);

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  5+0i 

[16:34] <evalable6> antononcube, rakudo-moar 138ba249e: OUTPUT: ¬´5+0i‚ê§¬ª

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For rationals, I would expect (<1/3> gcd <2/5> gcd <3/7>) = <1/105>.

[16:36] <librasteve_> Im trying to use subset to constrain an ordered List of Pairs - can someone please show e what I am missing‚Ä¶.? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/SBm0s6KH

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - I see - thanks for the tute

[16:42] <librasteve_> on my snippet - I don‚Äôt mind not having the coercion `NavItem()` ‚Ä¶ but I also get a (different) error without it

[16:43] *** merp joined
[16:52] <librasteve_> m: class Content {}; class Page {}; subset NavItem of Any where .value ~~ Content | Page; my NavItem @ni = [Page1 => Page.new, Page2 => Page.new]; say @ni;

[18:04] <[Coke]> I have App::Rak installed in my rakubrew install on windows in powershell. I can run raku, zef, etc, but rak is not found.

[18:05] <[Coke]> my $PROFILE has the '. ... init powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression ' and I opened a new powershell window to be safe.

[18:07] <lizmat> if you install another module that installs scripts, does it find those ?

[18:08] <[Coke]> ... Data::Dump failing tests...

[18:09] <[Coke]> nope. a new install of App::SudokuHelper also not found. I didn't think it was an App::Rak issue

[18:09] <lizmat> ok, then I have no idea  :-(

[18:19] <[Coke]> patrickb: Also getting a failed to unlink old file when doing a 'rakubrew self-upgrade'

[18:19] <[Coke]> Think I might need to wipe my install and try again. Think it didn't quite survive moving to my new laptop.

[18:22] *** nil78 left
[18:24] <[Coke]> ... also, managed to create a calendar event today called 'zef' somehow. :)

[18:25] <[Coke]> yup, needed a fresh instal, sorry for the noise.

[21:15] <[Coke]> This feels like an old question - why does "ok" generate not only the ok/not ok TAP but also a diag saying basically "Failed test" with only the line number as extra info?

[21:18] <[Coke]> also, prove6 -Q and -q are not quiet and are showing all the diag output

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not seeing this diag on my machine - maybe an ENV setting?

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - soz I do see it

[21:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Air-Play/t > raku 01-basic.rakutest not ok 1 - huh # Failed test 'huh' # at 01-basic.rakutest line 4 ok 2 - replace me 1..2 # You failed 1 test of 2

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> prove6 -Q is quiet on my box

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Air-Play/t > prove6 * 01-basic.rakutest .. ok All tests successful. Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs Result: PASS Air-Play/t > prove6 -q * All tests successful. Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs Result: PASS Air-Play/t > prove6 -Q *
