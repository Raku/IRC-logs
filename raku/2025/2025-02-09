[19:50] <lizmat> melezhik: thanks for the nudge

[19:51] <melezhik> welcome )

[19:52] <melezhik> maybe worth to add some sort of simple monitoring and kick tool? like an idea

[19:54] <lizmat> well, it should just recover from connections getting broken

[19:54] <lizmat> and it does for quite a few cases, but there's one case I haven't been able to identify in IRC::Client just yet  :-(

[19:54] <lizmat> as this affects all IRC::Client based bots  :-(

[19:55] <melezhik> "I haven't been able to identify Â ...yet" - yeah, that was intention - to add some monitoring / kick tool till it's been fixed in code ...

[19:55] <melezhik> anyways - just a thought ))

[20:04] <timo> lizmat: you can try launching one of the bots with a --debug-port so once it reaches the state where it's not reacting to stuff any more we could try having a look around? maybe Log::Timeline could/should be integrated with IRC::Client, that could be interesting.

[20:05] <lizmat> sometime in the next 3 months, I will be setting up a new box for the irclogs website and the logger

[20:06] <lizmat> at that time, I will be updating everything to latest and greatest

[20:06] <lizmat> for now, I don't want to spend time on that: it runs most of the time, and I don't really have a test machine: the test machine *is* production  :-)

[20:10] *** melezhik left
[20:16] <timo> OK

[20:17] <lizmat> sorry to be stubborn, but I plan to spend time on it, just not now (with the risk of more disruption)

[20:21] <timo> i don't have a problem with that
