[14:12] <lizmat> they updated Prime::Factor in the past 24 hours...

[14:15] <disbot1> <antononcube> Good to know! Maybe, "Prime::Factor" has now a faster integer factorization than "Math::NumberTheory".

[16:07] <lizmat> librasteve that's really minimal: https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Moonphase

[16:07] <lizmat> not even a URL to the repo ?

[16:15] <[Coke]> https://github.com/librasteve/Moonphase - looks like it's had a recent update, and more info in the repo.

[16:15] <lizmat> ah, 0.0.2 looks much better

[16:16] <lizmat> except for "description" in the META

[16:19] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/06/02/2025-22-surveyoverflow/

[16:25] <Guest98> lizmat: I couldn't figure out why all the modules you've been removing from the old ecosystem are still there. Are you aware that you have 14 recent commits in the master branch instead of main?

[16:26] <lizmat> argh...really?

[16:26] <Guest98> yeah

[16:26] <lizmat> meh..

[18:19] <Guest98> I'm allergic to github's privacy policy, don't use it any more. does zef/fez and whatever related tooling have any reason to care if my repos are somewhere else? and does anything actually parse :auth where I see github:whoever all over the place, or can I safely put whatever I want in there?

[18:21] <lizmat> Guest98: zef doesn't care where your repo lives, as long as it's reachable and the META6.json "auth" field allows you to upload with that

[18:23] <lizmat> e.g. https://raku.land/zef:knarkhov/Node::Ethereum::RLP has a repo on gitlab

[18:24] <lizmat> fez (the zef uploader) very much cares what you put in "auth", but it doesn't care where your repo lives

[18:24] <lizmat> afk&

[18:28] <Guest98> got it, thank you

[18:43] <disbot1> <librasteve> lizmat: on Moonphase, went off a little half cocked with v0.0.1 ... sorry guess you were doing the weekly!

[18:46] <disbot1> <librasteve> seen: skaji

[18:46] <tellable6> librasteve, I saw skaji 2021-10-22T01:56:00Z in #raku: <skaji> if you remove this line  https://github.com/tbrowder/DateTime-US/blob/master/t/01-general.t#L8, then the test will pass.

[18:48] <disbot1> <librasteve> the reason that I do not have a description in the META is that Mi6 did not put it there - so to get that to work need to do a PR on App::Mi6 ... but there are already two o/s PRs there from 2023-4 ... so first I think we ought to seize App::Mi6 for the commune
