[13:35] <tbrowder> i finally tracked down a raku code problem which wasn’t being caught early enough so it was misleading. i think i’ve been misled by it before: a spurious “ double quote at the end of a line was causing a report of an unexpected “is required” trait in the module much earlier in the code.

[13:36] <tbrowder> i guess that’s something a linter could find pretty easily.

[16:27] <[Coke]> I have an old vimrc that has some shortcuts I defined with, e.g. 'let @c="..."' - how do I invoke that? I cleverly didn't leave enough breadcrumbs to remind me.

[16:33] <Voldenet> have you tried @c

[16:33] <[Coke]> looks like it should just be @c, but that's not working. :(

[16:34] <[Coke]> :reg c shows me it's been registered.

[16:35] <stanrifkin> I think let @c just put the content into register c

[16:36] <[Coke]> Right, so when I'm editing, @c should invoke that macro, yes? (I had used these before, having touched my vimrc in ages, trying to figure out why it's not working now

[16:36] <[Coke]> "C<>: use the surround plugin to wrap in <>, prepend a C"

[16:36] <[Coke]> let @c="F<aC<\<esc>f\|i>\<esc>"

[16:37] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> The RHS is the key commands, that puts the capture in @c.

[16:37] <stanrifkin> hm... yes @c should invoke it

[16:37] <stanrifkin> :@c

[16:38] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> (...admittedly, it's been a while...).

[16:38] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> Isn't @c just a register?

[16:39] <[Coke]> and my comment mentions the surround plugin, which appears to still be setup in my ~/.vim

[16:42] *** ACfromTX left
[16:42] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> Do you have a mapleader set?

[16:42] <[Coke]> I have no idea what that means

[16:44] * [Coke] wonders if this annoyance is what gets him to give up on vim after nearly 40 years.

[16:44] <[Coke]> er, vi

[16:44] <Voldenet> the macro does work for me - it literally goes backward from cursor to <, appends C< does escape, finds |, and inserts > just before it

[16:45] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> search for leader or mapleader in your .vimrc, i think it is , comma by default.d

[16:45] <[Coke]> 'leader' doesn't appear in the vimrc.

[16:46] <Voldenet> (no idea what it's supposed to do)

[16:46] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> Okay, then I'm mis-remembering. Glad to hear you have it working.

[16:46] <[Coke]> for asdf, wrap in C<asdf>

[16:46] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> copy

[16:46] <[Coke]> was for editing rakudoc for the docs site

[16:47] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html

[16:47] <Voldenet> I have tried to love vim and emacs, yet I keep going back to vscode for some reason :>

[16:47] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/1cbd4b22164a74f963cf7c957397d1f1

[16:50] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> (sorry for the noise...I appear to be way off-topic).

[16:50] <stanrifkin> Voldenet: Can you add features like that to vscode?

[16:51] <stanrifkin> I heard that it is even impossible to change a theme. Because it's signed.

[16:52] <Voldenet> stanrifkin: there is a vim-like extension for it, but I've never had the need to use it, so I have no idea how it works

[16:52] <disbot2> <librasteve> tend to alternate vi and intellij … tried the vim mode in intellij but my brain stopped me

[16:55] *** ACfromTX joined
[16:56] <Voldenet> but yes, there are limits to what vscode can do sadly, I wish it had some built-in scripting

[16:59] <stanrifkin> There are a lot of new interesting editors. Helix?, Vis and so on.

[17:03] <Voldenet> I don't like how they're using regular text console, so they can't even have multiple text styles in one window - markdown preview? Forget it

[17:16] <[Coke]> OK, I reinstalled the surround plugin and now the @w is working, at least. @c doesn't appear to be doing what it should be, but is doing SOMETHING. weird. Wonder what changed since ... 2 years ago?

[17:21] <[Coke]> ok, let @c="ysiw>iC" is much better.

[17:21] <[Coke]> Thanks, folks.

[17:24] <[Coke]> ... now what doc was I looking at...
