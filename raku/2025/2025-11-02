[17:36] <[Coke]> a link to the PR would help

[17:37] <[Coke]> is there a lnk to a ticket showing the problem this is trying to avoid?

[17:37] <[Coke]> PR is https://github.com/skaji/mi6/pull/190

[17:42] <lizmat> do we have proof that that *is* an issue?     And if so, that it is an issue with App::Mi6 ?

[20:50] <arkiuat> I keep running into a problem where I'm expecting to use $_, and instead it magically disappears into something called LoweredAwayLexical (which doesn't do what I want)

[20:51] <arkiuat> every time I work around it, I'm left unenlightened about any general principle as to how to do so

[20:52] <ab5tract> arkiuat: do you have an example you can share?

[20:53] <arkiuat> In the current case, I'm looping over 3999 items, and the last half of them are processed, but the first half all disappear into the LoweredAwayLexical bit bucket, which makes it particularly mystifying

[20:53] <arkiuat> ab5tract: it's in a for loop inside another fairly long for loop, and I haven't started golfing it down yet

[20:55] <arkiuat> actually, now that I say that, I realize that this is happening in a third-level nested for-loop, where I've provided names for the loop variable for the inner and outer, but not the middle. Let me try changing that

[20:55] *** tellable6 joined
[20:55] *** coverable6 joined
[20:55] <arkiuat> (it was convenient to call .methods against the middle loop's variable, which is why I left it as $_)

[21:35] <arkiuat_> okay, I found the stupid line of code I had buried deep inside a subroutine right before I put this project down for several months (that otherwise hadn't been modified in a very long time)

[21:36] <arkiuat_> it was filtering out the input. So my complaint is merely that when I shoot myself in the foot in a spectacularly boneheaded way, it results in a mysterious LoweredAwayLexical phenomenon, which I suppose is LTA but I certainly don't know how to improve it

[21:42] <arkiuat_> this explains why I've never come up with a general principle, because I now expect the cause has always been boneheadedness on my part and not some kind of general situation

[23:31] <tbrowder> the doc suggestion does not say mi6 is at fault, but it may be and just warns about the possibility and gives an example of my use of Test::Output to mitigate it if the user experiences the same symptoms.
