[05:58] <patrickb> o/ Hi there! How do I introspect the nativecall types from Rakudo? e.g. I have some variable that might have a uint16 or so, how do I find out that it's a native unit with a width of 16?

[06:08] <patrickb> Ugh! It might actually be simpler than I thought and I'm just hitting a compiler bug. Investigating.

[14:55] <SmokeMachine> .landyacht.: thanks! There was a PR for Cro that I updated and it’s merged with part of those features… I’m preparing a new PR to add the rest of the features too.

[15:05] <patrickb> Why is this not P6int?

[15:10] *** arkiuat joined
[15:12] <lizmat> because in Rakudo the $i gets upgraded to Int somewhere in the nqp:: arg handling

[15:12] <lizmat> could be that it works in nqp

[15:14] <patrickb> So there is basically no way to introspect the native types in Rakudo land?

[18:26] <GreyTriangle> arkiuat: are you here?

[18:27] <GreyTriangle> When I came here before, asking for recommendations for my first programming language, I think it was you that said that Python was dangerous because it might do damage or drive me insane or something

[18:27] <arkiuat> GreyTriangle, yes, hello

[18:27] <GreyTriangle> I was "AspiringCoder"

[18:27] <arkiuat> hmm, no, I think that was antononcube

[18:27] <arkiuat> I was recommending Forth

[18:27] <GreyTriangle> Ah, I see.

[18:28] <GreyTriangle> Well, is antononcube here? I've been wanting to ask for some time - what is the danger with Python as a first language?

[18:28] <arkiuat> mostly that the libraries are very difficult to work with?

[18:28] <arkiuat> and there are a lot of them, so it's very sad

[18:30] <GreyTriangle> Alright then. Thank you!

[18:30] <ds7832> I used Python before Raku, and always found it a pain to arrange Python libs with virtualenv and what not. But, from what people recently say,

[18:30] *** vasko45 left
[18:30] <ds7832> with "uv" there seems to be a tool to make library management in python acceptable

[18:31] <arkiuat> I've been thinking it over, and I'm less reluctant to recommend Raku as a first language than I was when you first asked

[18:32] <arkiuat> ds7832, that's great news for the pythonistas

[18:32] <GreyTriangle> Interesting.

[18:32] <ds7832> yeah, people are quite enthused about it as far as I've seen

[18:33] <ds7832> In general, the decision of 1st programming language should probably take into account what role you wish it to play in your life, and your personal inclinations

[18:34] <arkiuat> I'd say it should also take into account whether you are planning to learn several different languages, or just want to settle down in your first language

[18:34] <ds7832> e.g. near-term employability? tool for crafting tools for home use? tinkering, hobby projects?

[18:35] <arkiuat> and ds7832 is quite correct here

[18:36] <ds7832> and if employability plays a role: Aim for developping new applications? Or (probably) less flashy but more stable and decently-paid job administering or maintaining existing systems? In the latter case Perl 5 could well be worth considering

[18:37] <ds7832> (but take my word on this with a few grains of salt)

[18:37] <GreyTriangle> I'm not looking to work as a software engineer, but I do aspire to work with 3D models and animation. I think Python goes well wit Blender.

[18:38] *** mimosa left
[18:39] <ds7832> Ah, well then yes, go by what language Blender has a good interface for and where good libraries exist

[18:39] <GreyTriangle> :)

[18:40] *** vasko45 joined
[19:07] <Voldenet> "near-term employability" would imply that the best language is some java or something equally boring

[19:07] <Voldenet> I'd say whatever's fun is the best language

[19:09] <Voldenet> java could be fun, but not in typically employable spring-like stack

[19:10] <Voldenet> and if someone is starting out, they won't get competitive soon, so with very long term goal in mind, it's important they don't drop programming before learning things

[19:12] <Voldenet> to me, java is burnout language, it's rigid and tries to avoid any form of fun

[19:12] *** stanrifkin joined
[19:13] <Voldenet> python is not great, but definitely more fun than java

[19:44] <ab5tract> anyone have access to a threadripper from the last 5 years? I'd love to see some Rakudo core setting compilation times

[19:47] <ab5tract> Voldenet: have you tried Kotlin?

[19:47] <ab5tract> I was just getting to the point of feeling like I had pared down my Java to a relatively sleek style

[19:48] <ab5tract> and then tried Kotlin, which makes quite a few excellent design decisions that amount to a somewhat similar feeling as to coding in Raku

[19:49] <ab5tract> dead easy class creation syntax is one that comes to mind, though I remember noticing a few others

[19:50] *** vasko45 left
[19:51] *** vasko45 joined
[20:18] *** hulk left
[20:37] <Voldenet> ab5tract: yes, imo it's great, but for some reason many teams don't like kotlin sadly :(

[20:37] <ab5tract> yeah, it boggles my mind :(

[20:38] <Voldenet> so in the end people make you use some outdated java, you can consider yourself lucky if you use quarkus or micronaut

[20:38] <Voldenet> or can use virtual threads

[20:44] <ab5tract> we are wedded to spring(boot) at work. I don't hate it. streams and lambdas are a must in terms of java version tho

[20:44] <ab5tract> records too

[20:52] <disbot> <antononcube> @GreyTriangle You can start here : https://pythonforprediction.wordpress.com/2022/09/18/breakdown-of-python-people-and-projects/

[20:54] <disbot> <antononcube> Especially, find and contemplate on “TSBEO-APOO-OWTDI” — it is a big reason not to use Python and see it as a detrimental first programming language.
