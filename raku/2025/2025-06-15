[13:27] <tbrowder> anyboy

[13:28] <tbrowder> anybody interested in raku for finance handling? such as the perl interface with GnuCash? or somthing simpler?

[14:00] <disbot1> <antononcube> I was ‚Äî to a point ‚Äî interested having a reasonably good interface to cryptocurrencies data. That is/was via Yahoo Finance. But they change their interface to use authorization, so, didn‚Äôt care updating ‚ÄúData:: Cryptocurrencies‚Äù.

[14:02] <disbot1> <antononcube> In general, though, that package has a good design of functions for financial data retrieval and time series analysis.

[14:05] *** Aedil joined
[14:14] <disbot1> <antononcube> I think "zef:slavenskoj" packages with generic names like "Korean", "English", "Russian", etc. should be prefixed with "Lingua::". For example "Lingua::English", "Lingua::Russian", etc.

[14:16] <disbot1> <antononcube> Or "Localization::Korean", "Localization::Russian", etc.

[14:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> But, maybe I am wrong about this -- and it has been "community-decided" to use that kind of naming for localizing the Raku keywords into whatever natural languages.

[14:35] <soverysour> hey everyone, is https://raku.guide/#_what_is_raku considered up to date/complete? I've seen a partial raku guide someplace else. Just looking for a complete reference to have by my side :)

[14:35] <tellable6> 2024-07-23T20:38:43Z #raku <librasteve> soverysour: for module authoring, App::Mi6 is indeed the go-to tool, for writing via an IDE then Commaide

[14:49] <tbrowder> antononcube: thnx, i‚Äôll take a look at Data:.*

[14:55] <disbot1> <antononcube> Good luck! üôÇ

[14:57] <tbrowder> ok, looks usable, BUT everthing current i see is the yahoo finance data api is not supported, regardless even if you have a paid account

[14:58] <tbrowder> so‚Ä¶i‚Äôm looking at financeapi.net BUT its json api is daunting, but i found JSON::Path
