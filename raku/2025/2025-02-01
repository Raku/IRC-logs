[00:50] <ugexe> i usually have a test called t/00-load.rakutest in all my distributions that basically do the first thing i showed with use-ok, and in those cases you could just do `raku -I. t/00-load.rakutest`

[15:22] <[Coke]> question: Regarding moving from a raku module to using curl to grab some data - is there a cross platform way to specify a dep on curl in the Meta? I could put it in build easily enough to die if it's not present, but that's not as good

[15:22] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4509

[15:22] <[Coke]> (also we don't install raku/doc anymore, so the build isn't called there anyway)

[15:23] <lizmat> something with "bin" if I recall correctly

[15:24] <lizmat> https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/blob/master/META6.json#L13 has an example I believe

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve I use Jupyter in VSCode becauase of the visualizations with "JavaScript::D3". In IntelliJ visualizations with "JavaScript::Google::Charts" can be used.

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is an example:

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/633753286209699870/1335282333682761728/IntelliJ-Raku-Chatbook-using-JavaScript-Google-Charts.png?ex=679f9a14&is=679e4894&hm=aea5c6739938a358d0174eadb82f15218c33b93e457eaf41a432080d366ff202&

[16:21] *** yewscion joined
[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have mentioned this before -- if I figured out that Google Charts existed I might have not implemented "JavaScript::D3". At least to the such degree as it currently is.

[16:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> From another hand, D3.js is much more flexible (and lower level) and "JavaScript::D3" can be much more attuned to my taste. (Or, preferably, Raku-programmers tastes.)

[16:26] *** yewscion left
[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "JavaScript::Google::Charts" is programmed in a very "hands off" manner -- the Raku invocations delegate to Google Charts as quickly was possible, using Google Charts' pre-canned functions (with very comprehensive options.)

[19:15] <ab5tract> tbrowder: unfortunately you were pointed to a slightly outdated version of the intellij plugin. I've just published a new beta release, available here: https://github.com/ab5tract/comma-plugin/releases/tag/2024.3-beta.4

[19:16] <ab5tract> need to look into why the archive file is indicating 2024.3-beta.1 , I've been upgrading the version tracking stuff

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I do like the map and the idea that JS can run in VSCode notebook ... ooth I am not sure I want to keep switching VSCode and IntelliJ... choices choices

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Highlighting of Raku in Jupyter notebook with VSCode is better than the highlighting in IntelliJ.

[19:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, VSCode Jupyter interface seems more intuitive to me. (I do not like Jupyter that much, in general.)

[20:06] <ab5tract> I wonder if the highlighting issues are related to the language not being set properly in the Jupyter notebook

[20:07] <ab5tract> If there is any difference between how IntelliJ is highlighting Raku outside of Jupyter vs inside of it, that should be easy-ish to resolve

[20:17] *** melezhik joined
[20:17] <melezhik> o/

[20:17] <melezhik> if it possible to generate raku function in runtime?

[20:17] *** librasteve_ joined
[20:18] <melezhik> say I have string defining function body and I'd like to create a raku function from it. So I could call it later?

[20:18] <melezhik> I am taking about EVAL/EVALFILE for clarity

[20:18] <[Coke]> There is an EVAL, sure.

[20:18] <melezhik> as they slow

[20:19] <melezhik> son just a sub foo = EVAL "some string" ?

[20:19] <melezhik> son -> so

[20:19] <[Coke]> m: my $a = 'say "fast enough"'; $a.EVAL

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «fast enough␤»

[20:20] <[Coke]> m: my $a = 'say "fast enough"'; EVAL $a

[20:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤EVAL is a very dangerous function!!! (use the MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL pragma␤to override this error but only if you're VERY sure your data contains␤no injection attacks).␤at <tmp>:1␤------> my $a = 'say "f…»

[20:20] <[Coke]> m: use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL; my $a = 'say "fast enough"'; EVAL $a

[20:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «fast enough␤»

[20:20] <[Coke]> let's assume I generated that error on purpose for teaching reasons. :)

[20:20] <melezhik> yeah, but I would like only to compile thing not run

[20:20] *** ulipink joined
[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Yes, there is a difference. Jupyter Raku kernel(s) (in IntelliJ) get confused with comments and magic cells.

[20:23] <librasteve_> Raku syntax highlighting in a jupyter notebook in Intellij — looks good to me https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/J3u78nze/Screenshot+2025-02-01+at+20.17.30.JPG

[20:23] <[Coke]> m: my $a = 'sub { say "running" }; say "compiling"'; my $b = $a.EVAL; $b();

[20:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for /home/camelia/EVAL_0:␤compiling␤Useless use of anonymous sub, did you forget to provide a name? (line 1)␤No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Bool'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:24] <[Coke]> my $a = 'sub q { say "running" }'; my $b = $a.EVAL; dd $b;

[20:24] <evalable6> [Coke], rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «$b = sub q { #`(Sub|2248622829520) ... }␤»

[20:24] <[Coke]> m: my $a = 'sub q { say "running" }'; my $b = $a.EVAL; dd $b;

[20:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72e2dcd13: OUTPUT: «$b = sub q { #`(Sub|5630754406536) ... }␤»

[20:25] <ab5tract> antononcube: That sounds like a Jupyter::Kernel issue more than an IntelliJ one, though

[20:26] <ab5tract> But I can try to take a look if you can provide reproducible inputs

[20:27] *** ulipink left
[20:27] <melezhik> [Coke] thanks

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I am not sure. IntelliJ handles magic cells differently.

[20:32] <ab5tract> Well, I don't use Jupyter enough to know what could happen when comments are misconstrued with magic cells

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Please try using: 1) magic cells, like, "#% html", "#% latex", and 2) cells with other languages, like, "#% js" or "#% javascript".

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ...

[20:35] *** melezhik left
[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> they work with python kernel, but not with raku kernel

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> guess I will give VSCode a shot if I need more magic

[23:49] <tbrowder> ab5tract: i'm confused...i look at the vscode site and they show two raku plugins. are those also the plugins for intelliJ?

[23:49] <ab5tract> no, I'm responding to your earlier question about Comma

[23:50] <tbrowder> ah, ok, whew, thought i was goin crazy! thnx

[23:50] <ab5tract> There is no standalone Comma anymore, but I'm linking to the spritual successor, which can be installed as a plugin in IntelliJ

[23:52] <tbrowder> gotcha, is the community version of intelliJ adequate or do you recommend getting a license?
