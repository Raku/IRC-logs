[09:36] <wayland> patrickb: You mean TWEAK itself will work?

[09:36] <wayland> As opposed to, say, the COMPOSE phaser?  

[09:38] <wayland> m: role A { has $.a = 1; submethod m1() { say $.a; } }; $c = A.new();

[09:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar b527cefcb: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Virtual method call $.a may not be used on partially constructed object (maybe you mean $!a for direct attribute access here?)␤at <tmp>:1␤------>  { has $.a = 1; submethod m1() { say $.a<HERE>; } }; $c = …»

[09:38] <wayland> Note that I never actually called the method, and yet it still complained about it.  

[09:41] <wayland> patrickb: I've tested it, and you're right!  vrurg++ !  :)  

[09:49] <wayland> That still doesn't negate the problem with submethods though.  

[09:50] <vasko> SmokeMachine I know what you mean but if you think about what it actually is: It's a model of something (e.g. Task) that has routes that can model what users can do with said thing. It also happens to have an HTML representation.

[09:53] <wayland> Anyone interested in the PHP Backed-Enum that I mentioned earlier (including coronila), https://raku.land/cpan:CTILMES/BitEnum gets us about half of that.

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb Hmm… yes and no. Long time ago (≈2 years ago) I ingested IRC logs in order to do data- and semantic analysis over them. I could not ingest them using Raku, so, I used Mathematica.

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am interested in all-Raku solution for all the steps: ingestion, semantic analysis, data- or time series analysis, plots and visualizations.

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @patrickb So, I am hoping someone to come up with IRC logs ingestion script. For that “ingestion” is an array or records, each record corresponding to an IRC message, say a hashmap with author, timestamp, and content.

[12:20] <tbrowder> hi, i'm working on a PR updating the Pod::TreeWalker distro in raku-community-modules. the module won't work without the user-provided Listener object, but in the constructer it's marked "is built" which I believe should be marked "is required" instead. thoughts anyone?

[16:13] <tellable6> wayland, I'll pass your message to Xliff

[16:46] <SmokeMachine> vasko: please, correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems to me you want a rest-resource instead of a component… and I think that makes sense… now I’m planing on creating a new module RestResource that will be a role that will add routes to CTO the same way ctomponents currently do. Change Cromponents to use that. It will also have a trait “is resource” that will handle an attribute as a resource and auto implement the 

[16:46] <SmokeMachine> needed methods depending on type, that way, one could do something like: class Task does Cromponent { …; has Bool $.done is resource } and that would add GET /task/<id>/done, PUT /task/<id>/done and DELETE /task/<id>/done. The problem with that is to integrate that with Red models… it will need a way to call self.^save after changing its value… maybe it needs something like: is resource{ :after{ self.^save } }

[16:52] *** simcop2387 left
[17:05] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: do you think we could share that RestResource between Cromponent and Air?

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, when is fez going to be fixed?

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It happens to often to me that using fez upload does not produce "uploads" and does not produce any messages of what is wrong.

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think there was some discussion (or promises) for better diagnostics of fez failures.

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think there is a shared "know-how" about fez problems diagnosis here (in IRC.) It is good to know is it still actual. (I.e. fez was improved.)

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I think that (a) Cromponent services could be decomposed a bit - such as roles for (a) the %.holder and loader, (ii) $.base and $.url and (iii) setting up routes (which is most of the code) and (b) the route response would need to be selectable for (i) crotmp, (ii) HTMX and (iii) REST since HTMX is usually offered as an API (returning HTML fragments) alongside a full REST API (returning JSON). So I

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> wouldn't call it RestResource since for HTML it would be be HTMXResource... ;-)

[17:36] <SmokeMachine> Maybe I should call that CroResource…

[17:37] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: Could you expand the first part of your response?

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sure (referring to https://github.com/librasteve/Air/blob/main/lib/Air/Component.rakumod) - which I forked from Cromponent in Nov ... (i) holder / loader is lines 245-257 ... basically this is a default to keep the holder of all the Cromponents in the type object ... [also serial allocation], (ii) base / url is lines 259-269 to have the Cromponent track its own url and (iii) is the main set up of routes (which iirc

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> guess is largely unchanged from your work except that the MYLOAD, MYCREATE etc defaults were moved into Cromponent to declutter the user code. So MAYBE we could have something like class Cromponent does Cromponent::Id does Cromponent::Url does Cromponent::Resource[CroTmp|HTMX|Rest] {}

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw I am happy for you to decide if this has any merit or just ignore me is fine too...
