[02:17] <SmokeMachine> guifa: add_parent? On this case (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/29f70d9c8668da36949b7a2541772fd149e3a94a/lib/MetamodelX/Red/Model.rakumod#L179) I added a role instead of a parent… but you can do that on compose, or on new_type…

[02:33] *** librasteve left
[02:47] *** librasteve joined
[02:48] <guifa> ah I was thinking about using set_default_parent

[02:48] <guifa> akin to the grammar

[07:41] <wayland76> Question: What's the official DockerHub image for Raku that tracks the latest release?  

[07:42] *** lichtkind left
[07:52] <Xliff> \o

[07:52] <Xliff> In the test module. How can I get subtest() to NOT output to the terminal?

[08:02] *** yewscion left
[08:04] *** lichtkind left
[08:05] *** yewscion joined
[08:19] <Xliff> In Test.pm6, we have subtest() doing "_diag "Subtest" ~ ($desc ?? ": " ~ $desc !! ''), :force-informative;' as its first instruction. For raw terminal based tests this causes problems. Can we make this go to $output, instead?

[08:40] <disbot3> <librasteve> Sussy: to answer your question So what is the niche or I would say the blue ocean we are looking for? It has been decided?

[08:45] *** yewscion left
[08:47] <disbot3> <librasteve> there are several promising directions - eg (i) raku Grammar fit for LLM-DSL, (ii) raku one-liners, (iii) unicode regexes, (iv) minority language coding and docs, (v) raku as the purest possible expression of HTMX ... the common thread here is that all of these have an external community (LLM folks, Unix folks,  regex folks, non-English coders, HTMX adherents) into which we can evangelise ... but I would say that open source

[08:47] <disbot3> is an exercise in cat herding and that this is more a process of throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks

[08:48] *** yewscion joined
[08:49] <disbot3> <librasteve> I'm putting my tuits into (v) btw and channeling my Matt Mullenweg anger into making a opinionated and distinctive web development library for coders (https://harcstack.org)

[10:13] <disbot3> <holmdunc> wayland76: If you click the vertical "..." icon in the YouTube playlist then "Show unavailable videos" then more detailed info is shown for the status of each video.

[10:14] <disbot3> <holmdunc> IMO YouTube made the change to hide unavailable videos in the UI by default because it reflected badly on YT themselves when peoples' carefully curated playlists ended up peppered with deleted videos (taken down to due to YT's terms of service)

[11:12] <wayland> holmdunc: Yes; my point is, there were 14 videos I could see there, and now they've been made private.  I want to know if this is intentional or accidental.

[12:06] <Xliff> To rebuild the test module, do I have to recompile raku or is there a workaround?

[12:12] *** librasteve joined
[12:32] <apogee_ntv> Raku experts: I'm working with Image::PNG::Portable, it's a pure Raku PNG reader/writer that was adopted by community libs. Is there a good way to optimize read/write functions? The naive implementation works but is very slow.

[12:33] <apogee_ntv> On an aside PNG is very hard to do concurrently if I want to add filters because the filters create dependencies between lines.

[14:58] <guifa> I think what I'll do is install an variable called 'Raku' that the webpage can communicate back with

[20:25] <tbrowder> yes, thanx

[20:29] <Xliff> apogee_ntv: Well, you should be able to see the progress at https://github.com/Xliff/raku-Terminal-NotCurses

[20:30] <Xliff> apogee: It's in a semi-usable state now, but packaging beyond my system hasn't been a priority so the install might be... dicey

[20:30] <Xliff> apogee: What distro are you on?

[20:35] *** lizmat left
[20:35] *** lizmat_ joined
[20:35] <apogee_ntv> Xliff: Mac OS :D

[20:36] <Xliff> LOLOL!

[20:36] <Xliff> OK. Let's see how close we can get you.

[20:36] <Xliff> Do you have notcurses installed? If so, what version?

[20:37] <apogee_ntv> 3.0.16

[20:37] <apogee_ntv> It looks like

[20:38] <Xliff> :s

[20:38] <Xliff> I'm porting 3.0.6

[20:38] <Xliff> Once done, I'll make the jump.

[20:38] <Xliff> There's a chance I might make it earlier, but that would mean me needing to start from scratch.

[20:39] <Xliff> It might be best if you want to fork the repo. Then you could create a branch for 3.0.16 and see how much work needs to be done to switch over.

[20:39] <Xliff> The big problem is generating the static.c file that's in the repo. That has to come from notcurses.h

[20:44] *** MasterDuke left
[20:53] <apogee_ntv> How did you generate it?

[20:57] <apogee_ntv> It might be worth building notcurses as part of the module so we're not depending on people having the right version installed?

[20:57] <apogee_ntv> Similar to how I did it with hf tokenizers?

[20:58] <apogee_ntv> https://github.com/m-doughty/Raku-Tokenizers (not sure this is the right way to do it but it works)

[21:00] <apogee_ntv> That way if we target 3.0.6 we can just create 3.0.6 dylib or so file and always link against that?

[21:24] <ingy> is there an env var to override rakudo writing to ~/.raku ?

[21:31] <disbot3> <librasteve> @romdav55_30502 - fork it, change to your auth, bump the version and fez it

[21:33] <Xliff> apogee_ntv: I'm not against that approach.
