[00:40] <disbot6> <antononcube> Well, it works now with both zef and at raku.land.

[00:46] <[Coke]> yah, was just trying to track down if it was a fez upload issue or a raku.land download issue.

[00:51] <ugexe> you can check for raku.land issues on https://raku.land/build fwiw although you'd need to know the name of what isnt showin gup

[00:51] <ugexe> that does some some issues though

[00:51] <ugexe> github/raku-community-modules/Pod-To-HTML

[00:52] <ugexe> i assume it cant find that because of the typo on https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Pod-To-HTML/blob/fa53c119c47cd27586a30076b529a23a1e93209c/META6.json#L52

[15:46] <ashfield> I tried to do something (1, 2) (elem) ((1, 2), (3, 4)), but this is False, so, (1) how come it's False and (2) what's the correct way to see if a list is a member of a list of lists?

[15:47] <ashfield> something like(*

[16:05] <lizmat> m: say (1, 2).item (elem) ((1, 2), (3, 4))

[16:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[16:06] <lizmat> heh  the problem is that lists aren't value types

[16:06] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2).WHICH, (1,2).WHICH

[16:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «ObjAt.new("List|6311739674928")␤ObjAt.new("List|6311739675024")␤»

[16:07] <ashfield> that makes sense

[16:07] <lizmat> note the lists have different WHICH's

[16:07] <ashfield> yeah

[16:07] <lizmat> perhaps https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/ValueList can be of use

[16:09] <Voldenet> m: say ((1, 2), (3, 4)).first({ $_ eq (1, 2) }).so

[16:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:09] <Voldenet> kinda bruteforce-ish but it's what you have to do anyway

[16:10] <lizmat> that depends on the stringification of (1,2)...  which may be troublesome for something like:

[16:10] <ashfield> yeah, it's not impossible to write a function/method to iterate over the second list and test with eqv

[16:10] <lizmat> m: say <<a "b c" d>>

[16:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «(a b c d)␤»

[16:10] <ashfield> I'll have a look at ValueList as well

[16:11] <lizmat> m: say ((1, 2), (3, 4)).first({ $_ eqv (1, 2) }).so

[16:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:11] <lizmat> eqv could work

[16:11] <lizmat> m: say ([1, 2], (3, 4)).first({ $_ eqv (1, 2) }).so

[16:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[16:11] <ashfield> I was just wondering if there was some library function I was overlooking or something for "contains-list" or something

[16:11] <Voldenet> ah, right, eqv could work better

[16:11] <lizmat> well, as Voldenet pointed out, there's .first

[16:11] <Voldenet> or smartmatch

[16:13] <Voldenet> sadly most languages don't contain such thing for lists comparison

[16:16] *** melezhik_ left
[16:16] *** melezhik_ joined
[16:17] <Voldenet> the whole .so approach has caveat

[16:17] <Voldenet> m: say ([1, 2], (3, 4)).first({ $_ ~~ (1, 2) }).so # this works

[16:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:18] <Voldenet> m: say ([1, 2], ()).first({ $_ ~~ () }).so # this doesn't, because .so on empty list is False

[16:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[16:19] <Voldenet> m: say ([1, 2], (3, 4)).first({ $_ ~~ (1, 2) }).defined # this works as long as you don't try to look for Nil

[16:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:20] <Voldenet> so…

[16:20] <Voldenet> m: say ([1, 2], (3, 4)).first({ $_ ~~ (1, 2) }, :k).defined # this is probably the best way, it returns index of the found value or nil

[16:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:22] <ashfield> ah, right, I misread what .first was doing earlier

[16:23] <ashfield> m: say [||] ((1,2),(3,4)).map: { $_ eqv (1,2) }

[16:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:24] <Voldenet> || will not work as you think

[16:24] <ashfield> oh really?

[16:24] <Voldenet> m: say [||] ((1,2),(3,4),(5,6)).map: { say $_; $_ eqv (1,2) } # no short-circuiting

[16:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «(1 2)␤(3 4)␤(5 6)␤True␤»

[16:25] <Voldenet> btw, I suggest a very tiny addition to standard library

[16:25] <ashfield> oh, yeah, I understand that it's making the whole list of bools first, if that's what you mean

[16:25] <ashfield> I suppose that's less efficient than .first

[16:25] <Voldenet> m: say ([1, 2], (3,4), Nil).contains((1, 2)) # this could simply do smartmatching

[16:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «Calling '.contains' on a List, did you mean '$item (elem) @list'?␤True␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤Use of Nil in string context␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤»

[16:26] <ugexe> contains on a list stringifies the lhs

[16:28] <ugexe> m: say ([1,2],[3,4]).contains((2,3))

[16:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «Calling '.contains' on a List, did you mean '$item (elem) @list'?␤True␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤»

[16:29] <Voldenet> indeed, but it'd be very convenient to have special .contains for Iterable

[16:34] *** melezhik_ left

[16:36] <Voldenet> m: sub has(Iterable $x, $y) { my $n = $x.iterator; until (my $item := $n.pull-one) =:= IterationEnd { return True if $item ~~ $y; }; False }; say ([1, 2], (3,4), Nil, 1).&has((1,2));

[16:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:37] <Voldenet> additional bonus is that it runs ACCEPTS so this is possible

[16:37] <Voldenet> m: sub has(Iterable $x, $y) { my $n = $x.iterator; until (my $item := $n.pull-one) =:= IterationEnd { return True if $item ~~ $y; }; False }; say ([1, 2], (3,4), Nil, 1).&has(Int);

[16:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a302e082: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[16:40] <Voldenet> and additional downside is that it runs ACCEPTS of course, strict equality is useful in some cases
