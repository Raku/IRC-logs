[08:19] <patrickb> lizmat: That `my $ioctl = try "...".EVAL;` thing can't be serialized because of "Missing serialize REPR function for REPR VMException (BOOTException)"

[08:19] <patrickb> Do you have an idea of how to defuse that VMException?

[08:21] *** arkiuat left
[08:28] <lizmat> my $ioctl = $_ with try "...".EVAL

[08:36] * patrickb tries

[08:38] <patrickb> Sadly that doesn't change anything. I tried adding try 'say "hey"'.EVAL; after that line.

[08:39] <patrickb> The error then changes to "Cannot modify an immutable 'Any' type object"

[09:56] <timo> just make sure you don't keep the exception. like, put a // Nil or something to work on the result of the try could work?

[10:01] <patrickb> I think the VM exception ends up in $!. Overwriting that with another try "say hey".EVAL; changes the error

[10:02] *** librasteve_ left
[10:04] <lizmat> why would $! get serialized ?

[10:05] <timo> ah, i remember seeing that issue somewhere else

[10:06] <timo> $! is a lexical in the outermost scope i assume, so any block inside of the file has that as a parent, directly or indirectly

[10:06] <timo> m: $! = "Hi there!"; sub test { say OUTER::$! }; test;

[10:33] <patrickb> it's this line that is giving me grief: https://git.sr.ht/~patrickb/Terminal-API/tree/main/item/lib/Terminal/API.rakumod#L91

[10:33] *** arkiuat joined
[10:33] <patrickb> The tests of that module run fine, but when running some other module using Terminal-API, it breaks.

[10:34] <patrickb> Can I somehow conditionally compile that code? I only need this code when: `if $*RAKU.compiler ~~ /rakudo/ && $*RAKU.compiler.version < v2025.12`

[10:35] <patrickb> well s/</>=/

[10:36] <patrickb> I think I did it

[10:37] <patrickb> my $ioctl; BEGIN { if ... { $ioctl = try "...".EVAL; } }

[13:15] <disbot1> <antononcube> @tbrowder For many programmers the adherence to Monad laws is too abstract and redundant. Also, for many/some programmers Monadic programming is “very important.” So, the for the Monad laws being part of the documentation — maybe it is a good idea. I would prioritize the documentation to have all relevant examples in one place.

[19:13] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine for now I have reverted my repo to manually specifying the timestamps and id columns in the models

[19:14] <SmokeMachine> I’m having trouble to fix that, but still working on that when I have time. Sorry for the delay…

[19:15] <[Coke]> Voldenet: might be easier to just learn how to do it in powershell. :)

[19:15] <[Coke]> though I do have rak installed, actually. hurm.

[19:20] <disbot1> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine no worries! I figured that it was pretty complicated to figure out so in the meantime I'll just manually specify the fields

[21:50] <disbot1> <librasteve> hi /

[21:53] <disbot1> <librasteve> please can someone tell me the "right" way to programatically export a constant via package EXPORT::DEFAULT  {} (ie that the result is that the use'ing script sees the symbols as thought they were constant x = 42 is export; ??

[22:20] <ab5tract> I think you can get a similar result by using &term:<x> 

[22:49] <disbot1> <librasteve> tx … i’ll try it!

[22:49] <arkiuat> librasteve: sorry to burden you with nerdy Fediverse weirdness, but It's not great for rakudoblog.weekly to force a redirect through mastodon.social when readers try to follow the links from David Schultz and Massa Humberto.

[22:51] <arkiuat> For example, what the rakudoweekly.blog is showing as https://mastodon.social/@dss@nerdculture.de/115536905099705425 should be published as https://nerdculture.de/@dss/115536905039687239

[22:51] <arkiuat> Neither of those guys use mastodon.social at all.

[22:52] <disbot1> <librasteve> arkuiat: thanks for the feedback … please can you explain how to get these better links?

[22:52] <arkiuat> well, just click through to the site where the link was originally posted before copying the link, rather than copying it as it appears on mastodon.social

[22:53] <arkiuat> I mean, the correct link is the one that mastodon.social's redirect page displays when it says "are you sure you want to leave mastodon.social?"

[22:53] <arkiuat> which really puzzled me, because I had never been on mastodon.social in the first place, and left me wondering how I had gotten there

[22:53] <disbot1> <librasteve> sounds like a lot of effort to me

[22:54] <disbot1> <librasteve> for each individual link

[22:54] <arkiuat> well, the "mastodon.social" link isn't THE link

[22:55] <arkiuat> I mean, look at the two version. nerdculture.de is the server where it was posted, not mastodon.social, the user doesn't change the the post-ID doesn't change

[22:55] <arkiuat> it's just reordering the components

[22:55] <arkiuat> or clicking through before copying, as I originally said. It's pretty bad to give free advertising to mastodon.social in the form of links to posts by users who deliberately eschew that particular server

[22:56] <disbot1> <librasteve> since i don’t spend time on Mastodon, please post all links here using the weekly command if you want me to include them

[22:57] <arkiuat> I guess the two links I mentioned came from other people using the weekly command then

[22:59] <arkiuat> I'll be happy to correct all links posted to you that way; I guess I'll just need to monitor the weekly so I can get you any needed corrections before you publish on Monday
