[00:13] <disbot5> <mi2ebi> what IDE tooling is there for Raku? in particular are there language servers and formatters that aren't tied to any specific editor (so e.g. no vscode extensions)?

[00:33] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> @mi2ebi we don't really have a full-featured language server for Raku, there is https://github.com/bscan/RakuNavigator but I don't know that it compares super strongly to other language servers such as the ones for python or ruby

[00:34] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> there are separate highlighters for raku, one of which i've been contributing to https://github.com/Raku/vim-raku/pull/41

[00:35] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> there is also https://github.com/Raku/intellij-ide-plugin for intellij

[01:20] *** Aedil left
[01:35] <disbot5> <antononcube> Well, VSCode is an IDE suitable for Raku.

[01:36] <disbot5> <antononcube> IntelliJ has nice Raku plugin: https://github.com/ab5tract/raku-intellij-plugin

[01:37] <disbot5> <antononcube> There are two Jupyter Raku kernels: "Jupyter::Kernel" and "Jupyter::Chatbook".

[01:38] <disbot5> <antononcube> There is RakuMode for Wolfram notebooks.

[01:40] <disbot5> <antononcube> There is also a (major) Raku-mode for Emacs. And I am sure some of the vi(m)-addicts here will tell you about their Raku setup.

[01:43] <disbot5> <antononcube> Ha! I did not know about this page: https://raku.org/nav/1/tools

[06:06] <japhb> Anyone know why fez uploads seem to be taking so long to process?  Both time to upload the tarball and time to index it into the ecosystem seem to be WAY longer of late.

[10:05] <lizmat> japhb: the problem may be with zef (the client), as it uses a 4-hour window by default before updating its cached info on what modules exist

[10:05] <lizmat> perhaps add a "zef update" in the CI ?

[19:00] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> I'm thinking of writing something for Raku advent

[19:01] <disbot5> <aruniecrisps> But I'm not sure what to write or even if I'm qualified to write something

[19:01] <disbot5> <librasteve> awesome, please do!

[19:02] <disbot5> <librasteve> you can take a look back at previous advents here to get some inspiration ... https://raku-advent.blog/2025/11/03/the-2025-raku-advent-posts/

[19:03] <disbot5> <librasteve> don't worry about "qualified" ... I am happy to review before we publish if you like

[19:04] <disbot5> <librasteve> for example, if you come to raku from another language - it would be great to hear about your experience

[19:06] <[Coke]> librasteve_: maybe some kind of first contributor badge on new authors? :)

[19:12] <disbot5> <antononcube> Let us come up a new snowflakes-and-camelias image for the advent 2025 review page.

[19:13] <japhb> lizmat: I don't think that's it, because I would locally do a `zef update` before searching for my upload, and still not finding it for hours afterwards.  I just checked -- I uploaded Text::MiscUtils 0.0.10 around 16 hours ago, and it's still not visible.

[19:13] <japhb> It seems like the delay has been getting worse and worse over the last week or so?

[19:15] *** lucs_ is now known as lucs
