[02:40] <grondilu> any idea why `sub MAIN { start do-stuff-for-less-than-ten-seconds(); sleep 10; }` would not behave or even segfault?

[02:40] <grondilu> when `sub MAIN { await start do-stuff-for-less-than-ten-seconds(); }` seems to work just fine?

[02:45] <Voldenet> because it's ran on thread scheduler

[02:45] <Voldenet> and when doing start you can't really expect any kind of timing

[02:47] <Voldenet> `Thread.start: &do-stuff-for-less-than-ten-seconds;` would start the actual thread in the background that would "hang" the app until aborted

[03:16] <grondilu> IIUC what I really want to do is `sub MAIN { my $job = start do-this(); do-that(); await $job; }`

[03:16] * grondilu checks

[03:17] <grondilu> still not quite working as expected.

[03:21] <grondilu> What I'm trying to do is something like: `sub MAIN { my $graphics-loop = start graphics-loop(); sleep 10; await $graphics-loop; }`

[03:21] <grondilu> `sleep` here is just meant to simulate some other job.

[03:21] <grondilu> https://gist.github.com/grondilu/8628e20fb4cc6d9191da94c8aa908a19

[03:22] <grondilu> this doesn't crash anymore, but the graphics loop does not seem to start until the sleep command has terminated.

[06:06] <Voldenet> `my $thread = Thread.start(…); $thread.join` would use OS-level scheduler which is probably more predictable in this case, task scheduler is better for tasks that wait more than compute (networking, or interacting with other processes) also `init-white` will malloc the color every time you call it, you'll want to cache it

[06:07] <Voldenet> rarely starting a thread is a good idea, but for any realtime rendering it's actually good, because you can increase priority

[06:07] <Voldenet> or bind specific thread to the specific cpu core

[08:09] <grondilu> turns out I can do without multithreading: https://gist.github.com/grondilu/c9882fdb4d6c5f6b43ce497b55781834

[08:10] <grondilu> ^this actually works, I can already play against Stockfish.  Which is kind of amazing for a short program of 200 lines or so.

[08:10] <grondilu> though it does use my Chess modules which are not really short.

[08:27] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> I probably have a Cro problem ? https://github.com/4zv4l/rakubin it used to work great, but just now I realized that when I setup tls and do a request from my browser using the IP instead of the hostname (get a certificate warning), that freezes the whole Cro part (web server), the tcp server part still works somehow

[13:19] <disbot6> <antononcube> I find this interesting: 1. This repository does not say what "termbin" is :  https://github.com/4zv4l/rakubin 2. This repository -- referenced from 1 -- does not say what "termbin" is :  https://github.com/insomnimus/termbin?tab=readme-ov-file 3. This page -- referenced from 2 -- does not say what "termbin" is : https://termbin.com

[13:24] *** arkiuat left
[13:24] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> On the page of termbin it’s written: > Send some text and read it back From my readme it says: > lets you create paste from the command line. With both and the name, similar to pastebin/rakubin/termbin still not very obvious ? Even with the example in the readme ?

[13:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> Again, that does not say what “termbin” is, it says, what it does.

[13:33] <disbot6> <antononcube> And, no, it is not obvious — obviously.

[16:32] <tbrowder> antononcube: i made a mistake, for all yr  articles i had the same problem, it wouldn't take the like either (i just now fixed tha), but i mistook the one on the 15th by @corbin. it is also good, and his style is like your style when you discuss or create other packages for regular Raku users, not LLMs, thus the mistake 

[16:33] *** Pixi` left
[16:35] <korvo> tbrowder: Thanks! Indeed I was writing for humans. I have a totally different style for writing articles where LLMs are the primary audience; I try to expand out concepts and leave links so that newbies can teach themselves.

[16:35] <korvo> ...Misleading semicolon. I explain for humans. LLMs don't need explanation, but syllogism.

[16:39] *** Pixi joined
[16:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> @korvo Your article is very popular. But both your article and the referenced one by Joel Jakubovic do not explain what is the benefit of this perspective. Maybe, the intended audience is just people who know Smalltalk...

[16:59] <disbot6> <antononcube> From another point of view -- yes, Raku is very good at indulging making parsers and interpreters for new DSL ideas.

[16:59] <korvo> antononcube: The relevant concept in Kell and Jakubovic's papers is *fragmentation*. Quoting https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/onward25-jakubovic.pdf p4:

[17:00] <korvo> "Fragmentation refers to how every language ecosystem insists on its own version of very similar infrastructure: its own libraries, package manager, build system, debugger..."

[17:02] <korvo> I have been irritated with this for years, FWIW. Previously, on Lobsters and Software Engineering SE, we discussed the extent to which MLs or anything with ML-style modules can skip the concept of packages entirely: https://lobste.rs/s/xi3mi0/does_programming_language_with_ml_style

[17:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> Thanks for pointing out the "fragmentation" section of the article. Today the "Conclusion" section of that article sounds more informative to me...

[17:15] <disbot6> <antononcube> @korvo I haven't not used ML for 20+ years -- does that discussion apply to Raku's or Perl's ecosystems?

[17:17] <korvo> It could have applied to Raku in the past. I can't ask language communities to stop what they're currently doing, even if I think that it's a mistake. And it's not like zef is bad.

[17:17] <disbot6> <antononcube> Well, OpenAI's "gpt-5.2" says, no, it does not apply to Raku. 🤖

[17:18] <korvo> The original question, which had been closed, isn't ML-specific. It challenges the more general idea of packages in *any* language. But that was considered too broad for Software Engineering SE.

[17:19] <korvo> ...I'm not continuing that conversation, sorry.

[17:21] <disbot6> <antononcube> Ok. I just want to say that "gpt-5.2" said more or less the same thing: > Stripped of ML jargon, that discussion is about: > > How much semantic structure a language can infer automatically vs how much > > must be made explicit — and how that affects readability, tooling, and large > ecosystems.

[17:22] <korvo> Okay. Wrong, but understandable.
