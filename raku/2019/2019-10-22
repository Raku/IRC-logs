[00:58] <Grinnz> I hope that this is reasonable: https://github.com/perlorg/perlweb/pull/297

[01:36] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: I think you can adjust it even more, but you decide, I guess

[01:37] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: if I was doing these changes I'd probably leave “(formerly known as Perl 6)” out

[01:38] <Grinnz> well it serves two things: a breadcrumb for those who already know what perl 6 is, and for why raku is mentioned in the places it is

[01:38] <AlexDaniel> then you don't need “Raku is not intended as a replacement for Perl 5, but as its own thing”, the text overall should become simpler

[01:38] <Grinnz> perhaps it will be unnecessary in the future, but i think it's useful at the moment

[01:39] <AlexDaniel> sure

[01:39] <Grinnz> and well, perl.org is much simpler to get changed than perl as you can see :P

[01:40] <Grinnz> (ironically, run by the same people who are currently shutting down rt.perl.org)

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> I've noticed the changes, btw

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> now it says “Rakudo Bugs” instead of perl6 and links to https://rakudo.org/bugs

[01:41] <Grinnz> hmm, that's not something i changed

[01:41] <Grinnz> where's that?

[01:41] <AlexDaniel> I understand, yeah, that's on rt

[01:41] <Grinnz> ohh, right

[01:41] <Grinnz> cool

[01:42] <AlexDaniel> it's a bit weird because I think I used to click there to see rt queue

[01:42] <AlexDaniel> and I see that perl5 tickets are already moved to github

[01:42] <Grinnz> yeah that was done over the weekend

[01:43] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: what's the plan for “CPAN Module Bugs”? Is it the same cpan instance or not? Is it going to be kept up?

[01:43] <Grinnz> there are no plans to change rt.cpan.org, and that instance is maintained by best practical

[01:43] <AlexDaniel> just curious, no real reason why I ask this :)

[01:44] <Grinnz> funny enough rt.perl.org also says it's maintained by best practical, but it has been maintained by the noc

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: “Perl -- When the best is good enough.” that -- triggers me :D

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> I like the fresh look of perl.org, btw

[01:46] <Grinnz> it was a good redesign, except when they tried to apply it to perldoc (an ongoing struggle for me atm)

[01:46] <AlexDaniel> the docs are a bit hard to read but maybe that's because I'm used to the old design

[01:46] <AlexDaniel> ah, ok

[01:46] <AlexDaniel> I see :D

[01:46] <AlexDaniel> I feel completely disoriented

[01:46] <Grinnz> the main problem is i have yet to get anyone to admit who is actually in charge of perldoc.perl.org

[12:43] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: use IRC::Client instead

[12:44] <Doc_Holliwood> I just tried to put two TWEAKs into one class, hoping it would sort it out via signature

[12:44] <Doc_Holliwood> didn't work

[12:45] <jnthn> m: class C { has $.x; multi submethod TWEAK(:$a!) { $!x = 1; }; multi submethod TWEAK(:$b!) { $!x = 2 } }; C.new(:a).x.say; C.new(:b).x.say;

[12:47] <jnthn> (Thus the need to demand them with `!`)

[13:09] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I'm still on the beginning of doing that bot... but is there a better way to make it safe to run code than run that on a docker container?

[13:11] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: well, it depends on your definition of safe, some will argue that just running something in a docker container is unsafe and it's better to whitelist the syscalls with seccomp

[13:12] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: question is how much freedom do you want to give to the users

[13:12] <AlexDaniel> for example, what about network access?

[13:13] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: anyway what you're doing now is probably pretty good

[13:13] <AlexDaniel> I mean, like, good enough

[18:50] <brass> Are promises randomly scheduled on different threads?

[18:50] <MasterDuke> i think so

[18:54] <Kaiepi> do supplies use threads when you don't use Supply.schedule-on?

[19:03] <Kaiepi> guessing no

[19:07] *** stoned75 left

[19:10] <brass> Are all rakudo threads contained in a single OS thread? I only see a single rakudo thread in htop

[19:10] <brass> Does it automatically take advantages of multiple OS threads if needed?

[20:51] <mspo> "doing"?

[20:51] <mspo> like official images?

[20:54] <SmokeMachine> mspo: no, I was meaning run code from IRC on docker... like this: https://github.com/FCO/RedBot/blob/master/lib/RedBot.pm6#L4

[20:57] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: `multi method irc-all() {` should be enough, then just pass ‘red’ as an alias to IRC::Client like `IRC::Client.new(…, alias => red)`

[20:57] <AlexDaniel> I mean, ‘red’

[20:58] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: this way the bot will reply to both `red:` and `redable:`, which makes it foolproof and also consistent with other bots on this channel

[21:00] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: also, I mean `multi method irc-all($_) {`

[21:00] <AlexDaniel> of course :)

[21:00] <AlexDaniel> fwiw, the smallest whateverable bot is probably nativecallable6: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/xbin/Nativecallable.p6

[21:02] <AlexDaniel> so you just have to do `does Whateverable`, implement `help` method, and ideally use `.selfrun` because it adds some useful magic

[21:02] *** ctilmes joined
[21:03] <AlexDaniel> and that's how you can write tests for whateverable bots: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/xt/nativecallable.t

[21:04] <ctilmes> SmokeMachine: You can use Docker::API to automate docker stuff from within Raku -- like 'create container' 'run job', etc.

[21:05] <SmokeMachine> ctilmes: I tried installing it without success...

[21:05] <ctilmes> Do you have LibCurl installed/working?

[21:05] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I'm changing it...

[21:06] <SmokeMachine> ctilmes: maybe that's the reason...

[21:06] <ctilmes> SmokeMachine: what OS?  A flavor of Linux?

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: let me know if you stumble upon any problem, I should be able to help :)

[21:06] <SmokeMachine> ctilmes: mac

[21:07] <ctilmes> SmokeMachine: Ah... I haven't done testing/etc. for mac

[21:17] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: installing Whateverable I got this error:

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: try `zef install https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake.git`

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: it was an issue in Sake, which was fixed, but the version wasn't bumped so I think it is somehow still trying to use the old version

[21:46] <SmokeMachine> so, should I use `--force`?

[21:46] <SmokeMachine> `--force-install`

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> what about `zef install https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake.git` ?

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> it should work without --force

[21:47] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel:  https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/g8wCIEC0/

[21:47] <SmokeMachine> with `--force-install` it worked...

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> ok

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> now whateverable should probably install fine?

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> it depends on Cro though, which used to fail some tests sometimes

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> so maybe try with --/test

[21:48] <SmokeMachine> I've installed that with `--/test`... :(

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> yep, it's ok

[21:49] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: on that example you sent me, what runs the bot?

[21:51] *** ctilmes left
[21:53] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: should `selfrun` run the bot?

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: just run the file and it should be almost ok. The only missing bit is that you need to pipe a config into it https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/config-default.json

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: so `perl6 Nativecallable6.p6 < config-default.json`

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: if whateverable checkout there are sake targets and stuff to make this easier

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: but yeah, it does, but it will also attempt to read the config from stdin

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> not sure how to do it better

[21:56] *** sena_kun left
[21:57] <AlexDaniel> like, I usually use `sake debug:nativecallable` and it runs the thing

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> that's in whateverable repo, of course :)

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: also try with DEBUGGABLE=1 env var
