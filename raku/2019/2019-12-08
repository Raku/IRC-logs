[02:52] <ZzZombo> And where is Camelia?

[02:53] <xinming> I don't mean the same result, What I mean is, wether it's possible to merge 2 Seq to be like a single Seq.

[02:53] <xinming> The ((^5).Seq, (^Inf).Seq).flat   will eager enumerate all values.

[02:54] <xinming> Something like,  $seq1.append($seq2), Where we get another Seq

[02:54] <xinming> Or maybe I still in confuson about Seq

[03:50] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[03:50] <simcop2387> i need to change some other stuff still for the address/non-addressed stuff hold on

[03:51] <AlexDaniel> oh it now does newlines properly :)

[03:52] <ZzZombo> perlbot: eval: role NamedObject[Str:D $name]{has $.name = $name};say NamedObject['asd'].new

[03:52] <simcop2387> yea that's one of the things i had to update for the channel

[03:52] <simcop2387> and i had to restart it for the non-address config, give it a few minutes (freenode takes forever to reload)

[03:52] <simcop2387> perlbot: hi

[03:54] <ZzZombo> perlbot: eval: role NamedObject[Str:D $name]{has $.name = $name};say NamedObject['asd'].new

[03:54] <simcop2387> the real slow part is that it does /who on every channel and parses the responses so it knows who's an op and everyone's hostname

[03:54] <AlexDaniel> why tho

[03:54] <simcop2387> it uses that data for some of the security and permissions things

[03:55] <simcop2387> it also learns who's registered/logged in to services that way (at least on freenode)

[03:55] <AlexDaniel> can't it be lazied?

[03:56] <simcop2387> not in a meaningful way thanks to some of the stupid ways that irc works

[03:56] <simcop2387> i've tried :/

[03:56] <simcop2387> perlbot: echo hi

[03:56] <simcop2387> hrm it should have been done by now i thought

[03:57] <simcop2387> there are some things that could in theory be done to help but they're difficult/annoying to do so i haven't done them yet

[03:57] <simcop2387> finally

[03:57] <perlbot> simcop2387: hi

[03:58] <simcop2387> this is why i try not to have to update those parts of it very often.  i need to rewrite the channel config stuff so it can be changed at runtime

[03:58] <ZzZombo> It still doesn't work in PMs: "<perlbot> ERROR: syntax error at (IRC) line 1, near "Str:""

[03:58] <simcop2387> ZzZombo: that's because eval: is by default perl5 everywhere but here and #perl6, try rkeval

[03:59] <ZzZombo> How do I use it then?
