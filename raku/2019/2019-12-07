[07:36] <corvu> Hi :)

[07:46] *** atweiden-air joined
[07:49] <atweiden-air> i'm trying to update the macos rakudo homebrew formula to 2019.11

[07:49] <atweiden-air> it builds and installs fine, but the test which is as follows, is failing:

[07:49] <atweiden-air> cd nqp-2019.11; cd src/vm/moar/stage0; moar nqp.moarvm -e 'for (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) { print($_) }'

[07:49] <atweiden-air> this test passes on void linux with MoarVM-2019.11, so it must be macos-related

[07:49] <atweiden-air> unfortunately i can't install moar-2019.11 with either p6env or rakudobrew on my macbook, so i have no way of seeing if this test failure is being caused by homebrew system libs, or whether everyone is getting this error

[07:49] <atweiden-air> can someone who has 2019.11 installed on macos do me a huge favor? please run this test using the nqp-2019.11 release tarball

[07:50] <atweiden-air> cd nqp-2019.11; cd src/vm/moar/stage0; moar nqp.moarvm -e 'for (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) { print($_) }'

[16:18] <tbrowder> hi all

[16:18] *** llfourn joined
[16:19] <tbrowder> i just spent a frustrating time trying to get some subs in a raku module to export properly.

[16:23] <tbrowder> i finally found that, apparently, if one sub has an export tag, then ALL subs must have an export tag. i see no note about it in the docs' modules section (and i helped with writing that), but i vaguely remember the problem early on and thought that would be a entry for traps to avoid but was shot down.

[16:24] *** llfourn left
[16:26] <tbrowder> the error msgs are LTA and thathowever, i will add a note to the docs unless someone can show i'm making a mistake. i will check again to

[16:26] <tbrowder> fumble....

[16:26] <sena_kun> tbrowder: hmm, are you sure? Let me check...

[16:28] *** Kaiepi left
[16:28] *** llfourn joined
[16:29] *** wamba left
[16:29] <sena_kun> tbrowder: I have `my sub hehe { 42.say }; our sub foo is export { 50.say }` in Foo.pm6 and `use Foo; foo` in `a.pm6` and `perl6 -I. a.pm6` (don't do that in home directory because of `-I.`) prints 50

[16:32] *** cpan-raku joined
[16:32] <tbrowder> i used 3 simple subs, one with an export tag and two without, and i rearranged them to no effect. in your example, none of them have export tags.

[16:33] <tbrowder> tag": ... is export(:some-tag) {...}

[16:33] *** llfourn left
[16:33] <sena_kun> tbrowder: aaaaah, export tags, sorry...

[16:34] <sena_kun> tbrowder: are you sure it is not a bug? maybe better to create a rakudo ticket before changing docs?

[16:34] <tbrowder> i have all subs in module with "is export" but only one with a tag, i believe that is the problem.

[16:36] <tbrowder> well, i haven't looked at "speculations" in that area for a long time, nor have i looked at roast, but good point. in the meantime, i can press on with my project.

[16:37] <tbrowder> but i will submit an issue just in case, yes?

[16:37] <sena_kun> tbrowder: I'd vote for a ticket to clarify the situation, maybe that's a bug...

[16:37] *** llfourn joined
