[11:56] <El_Che> damn

[11:58] *** andrzejku left
[11:58] <jmerelo> Maybe we should preemptively create rakulang, just in case

[12:25] <jmerelo> This error in the documentation tests is happening infrequently, but often https://travis-ci.org/perl6/doc/builds/616242100?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=email

[12:25] <jmerelo> Look at line 177 on

[12:25] <jmerelo> It's registered as a Rakudo bug, but it's almost impossible to understand what's going on there.

[12:32] <moritz> could be non-deterministic behavior in the test or the tested code as well

[13:05] *** jmerelo left
[13:07] <tbrowder> strange that there is no info on the owner of github/raku. maybe perl6 owner can get github to look into the issue

[18:06] <Kaiepi> jmerelo, my issue is that the object orientation page is already pretty exhaustive wrt how classes are used. apart from how you'd write static fields in raku, i'm not sure it adds much

[22:04] <libertas> hi, what is the extension for raku files? .p6? .raku?

[22:05] *** sena_kun left
[22:05] <Altai-man_> libertas, .raku, but it is safe to use .p6 for now and it'll be supported by all tooling for a long migration period

[22:07] <normanrockwell> is the same true for .pm6? (new to Raku and I have recently started trying to write a small library)

[22:07] <libertas> my vim editor doesn't seem to recognize .raku, that's why I asked

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> normanrockwell: for modules it doesn't really matter that much, what you declare in META6.json is what's important

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> libertas: please file a ticket, it should be fixed https://github.com/vim-perl/vim-perl6/issues

[22:16] <normanrockwell> AlexDaniel: you're talking about the 'provides' section of META6.json, correct?
