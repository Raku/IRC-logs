[01:57] <guifa> I’m guessin the answer is probably no but

[01:57] *** wildtrees left
[01:58] <guifa> Is it possible in a reference style like %foo<bar><xyz> for foo to know you want both bar’s xyz?  

[02:19] <guifa> I guess %foo’s AT-KEY could sneakily mixin a role that overrides the default AT-KEY and leaves a reference to itself

[02:32] <kjk> p6: sub gg { try fail 123 }; gg

[02:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: ( no output )

[02:32] <kjk> p6: sub gg { try EVAL "fail 123" }; gg

[02:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: «123␤  in block <unit> at EVAL_0 line 1␤  in sub gg at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[02:33] <kjk> it looks like Failure from EVAL is not contained by try when used in a sub?

[02:34] <guifa> Indeed it seems that way, not sure if that’s by design (I imagine not)

[02:35] <guifa> but this does work

[02:35] <guifa> sub hh { EVAL “fail 123” }; sub gg { try hh }; gg; say “All OK”

[02:35] <evalable6> guifa, rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: «All OK␤»

[02:37] <guifa> sub hh($e) { use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL; EVAL $e }; sub gg { try hh("fail 123") }; gg; say "All OK";

[02:37] <kjk> hmm interesting, anyway, I guess I'll open a bug report then

[02:37] <evalable6> guifa, rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: «All OK␤»

[02:37] <guifa> It almost certainly is a bug given those. 

[02:38] <guifa> But I guess the temporary work around is simple enough

[02:38] <kjk> yeah, I'll use the work around. Thanks!

[11:26] <hankache> hi lizmat

[11:27] <hankache> I got a bit of free time and was thinking of updating perl6intro

[11:27] <hankache> I was wondering if I should change the links to the docs or not?

[11:28] *** mid_laptop joined
[11:36] <hankache> So should I update links to docs.raku.org or not yet?

[11:36] <hankache> What about the twitter @perl6org handle and pl6anet.org?

[11:50] <lizmat> hankache: yes, links can be adapted now

[11:50] <lizmat> and perhaps move to a "rakuintro.com" ?

[11:50] <lizmat> I'm not sure about the future of pl6anet.org

[12:38] <lizmat> wee, a mid-months Squashathoin ?

[12:39] <Altai-man_> seems so, but I don't think the topic was settled... I'll be writting advent articles anyway, because deadline is close and a cold has caught me this month in not the best timing. :/

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> it kinda… slipped through the cracks…

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: we can do it if you tell me the topic for this month :)

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> or we cancel it alltogether…

[12:50] <Altai-man_> AlexDaniel, one thing that comes to mind is https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/issues/324 but I suspect some modules are, well, simply abandones, so not sure how we can count the efforts...

[12:50] <Altai-man_> but I'd just cancel it this month, tbh

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> we can set the webhook on ecosystem/ repo and the bot will count edits to that ticket

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, I guess no squashathon this month…

[12:54] <AlexDaniel> Altai-man_: like this? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: why not?

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> “The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file renames (currently there is no option to turn the rename-following off).”

[14:53] <Grinnz> hmm, maybe it does in some cases, it did not seem to work in the brief examples i checked

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> example: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blame/master/src/core.c/Any-iterable-methods.pm6

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> all files in core.c/ were moved from core/

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> history, on the other hand, seems to be broken :( https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/master/src/core.c/Any-iterable-methods.pm6

[14:54] *** jaldhar left
[14:54] *** jaldhar joined
[14:54] <Grinnz> maybe it depends whether the file was also changed when renamed

[14:55] <AlexDaniel> well, I'd say it's github itself being stupid

[14:55] <AlexDaniel> `git log` will not follow by default, but with --follow it works fine

[14:55] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/900

[15:13] <Altreus> I'm a bit confused about language basics because I'm a perl5-er. I assumed that I could address a function by its Fully::Qualified::name() ... if I can then I don't know how to define it

[15:14] <Altreus> I assumed I could have unit package Fully::Qualified; sub name() {}

[15:37] <Altreus> Help would be much appreciated because I do not understand this: https://gist.github.com/Altreus/7ae23f15c26345e72516b5c64d7a65b1

[15:38] <Altreus> also I'd kind of like to set $*RED-DB globally when the service starts but I don't know how to do that

[15:42] *** mid_laptop left
[15:43] <jnthn> Altreus: You'd need to put it in PROCESS::<$RED-DB> (or GLOBAL::) I guess...*but*...

[15:43] <jnthn> Altreus: The more typical Cro way is to pass such dependencies into the route sub as an argument

[15:44] <vrurg> Altreus: look at red-defaults. 

[15:44] <jnthn> https://cro.services/docs/structuring-services#A_functional_structure_for_dependencies

[15:46] <Altreus> I will peruse these things and hopefully learn something :D

[15:48] <Altreus> uh how do I "look at red-defaults", if you'll forgive a possibly stupid question?

[15:49] <Altreus> vrurg: :) ^

[15:50] *** robertle left
[15:52] <Altreus> ah an undocumented routine!

[15:53] <vrurg> Altreus: not yet documented, but it's now a mainline feature.

[15:53] <vrurg> sorry, will be afk for a few hours.

[15:56] <vrurg> Altreus: but before I'm gone, one last thing: it's not considered a good practice to be used in a non-single DB environment. It's mostly targeting needs of small-to-midsize apps.

[16:16] <Altreus> this is a tiny app :)

[16:16] <Altreus> jnthn: Don't know how to jsonify UUID

[16:16] <Altreus> oops, pasted newline

[16:17] <Altreus> I was going to say, can I tell it to stringify this without making a whole custom serialiser?

[16:18] *** hankache left
[16:18] <Altreus> although I'm not sure why I would be in that situation

[16:18] <Altreus> The question is academic but still valuable

[16:19] <Altreus> Also it's JSONifying a Bool as an Int

[16:21] <johnjay> If a compiler is twice as hard to write as the language... does that mean a clever person can make a language so good he can't parse it?

[16:21] <El_Che> you're describing Perl

[16:23] <jnthn> Altreus: It just uses JSON::Fast

[16:24] <jnthn> https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/lib/Cro/HTTP/BodySerializers.pm6#L70 is the implementation of it, fwiw

[16:25] <jnthn> (The body serializer, that is)

[16:27] <Altreus> ah I think SQLite gave me a 0 - red didn't boolify it for me

[16:28] <Altreus> El_Che: the same principle applies to PHP

[16:28] <jnthn> That'd make more sense...I'd be surprised if JSON::Fast wasn't doing booleans right :)
