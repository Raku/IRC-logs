[00:42] <WRSomsky> I was wondering: Can the current rakudo compiler (2019.11) be dropped into rakudo-star 2019.03?  Mostly wondering for getting a jump on the Perl6 -> Raku renaming...

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> WRSomsky: I'm curious, why do you use star? :)

[00:43] <WRSomsky> Thought that was the way to get the appropriate libraries/modules/etc.

[00:44] * vrurg wonders if RakudoStart makes any sense in the light of rakudobrew existance.

[00:44] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! LibXML (0.2.1) by 03WARRINGD

[00:49] <Kaiepi> just uploaded a new module that will be of interest of anyone working with the MOP :)

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> WRSomsky: you can just install modules that you need with zef

[00:51] <AlexDaniel> Star is probably useful on Windows, but everywhere else you can probably do without

[00:52] <WRSomsky> Ah.  I've been using perl5 for years, but only glanced at perl6/6lrep/raku so far.

[15:32] <sarna> (let‚Äôs say I‚Äôd like to send a script to my pal and want them to avoid the pain of installing rakudo n friends)

[15:33] <[Coke]> Docker?

[15:34] <tyil> tbrowder: maybe jj has an idea, I'm not familiar with WordPress at all :<

[15:36] <tbrowder> tyil: i think you said you did your advent articles in raw html? or was that someone else?

[15:39] <tyil> I did some raw html in order to get fixed-width text working correctly

[15:39] <tyil> there was no button in the rich text formatter to get this done

[15:41] <tbrowder> thnx

[15:46] <sarna> [Coke]: well, that seems like the only option :( thanks

[15:48] <sarna> did the gsoc project get anywhere? or was it only to reduce the startup time, I don‚Äôt remember

[15:51] *** chloekek joined
[15:55] <tyil> sarna: I believe it had limitations on using multiple modules, but was working when you only used core functionality

[15:55] <sarna> tyil: was it self-contained though? I mean it was able to run without rakudo?

[15:56] <tyil> I believe it was, yes

[15:56] <tyil> a single binary file that you could share

[15:56] <sarna> would be very nice

[15:57] <sarna> sometimes at work I have to run a script on a remote server I can‚Äôt install anything on

[15:58] <tyil> sarna: I can't check out the project on the GSoC dashboard as I wasn't the mentor of that mentee

[16:09] <sarna> by the way, does raku automatically close files?

[16:13] <sena_kun> sarna, what do you mean? I mean, what way to work with files do you use?

[16:15] <jnthn> sarna: At exit, I think yes, but there's no promise of them being closed in any kind of timely manner otherwise.

[16:26] <japhb> sarna: File handles that *you* open are not autoclosed, but see the discussions at https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Handle#routine_close and https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#index-entry-Phasers__will_trait for a way to make sure they close at scope exit.

[16:27] <japhb> sarna: In other words, declaring the file handle as e.g. `my $fh will leave(*.close) = ...`

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> japhb: pretty sure they are closed nowadays

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> at exit, even if you use `exit` if I'm not mistaken

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> or at least that was improved fairly recently (like a year ago or so?)

[16:36] *** jmerelo joined
[16:38] *** abraxxa left
[16:38] *** abraxxa joined
[16:39] <japhb> AlexDaniel: I didn't mean at exit, I meant when the FH is out of scope.

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> right! yes

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> but then, they're still closed once GC-ed, no?

[16:39] <japhb> Especially people coming from a refcounted language will commonly make the mistake of assuming out of scope --> closed

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> which may happen whenever, but still :)

[16:40] <japhb> Yes, but GC can happen after your process is out of handles, because out of handles doesn't trigger GC yet.

[16:40] <AlexDaniel> that's correct, yes :)

[16:41] * japhb wonders if we ought to actually fix that (make an out of handles/descriptors error trigger GC)

[16:42] <AlexDaniel> and I wonder if `will leave` actually works

[16:42] * AlexDaniel tests

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> japhb: yeah that doesn't work I think

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> not that cleanly for sure

[16:46] <AlexDaniel> you need to check if the filehandle was created at all, it can be Nil

[16:46] <AlexDaniel> then it's fine

[16:46] <AlexDaniel> will leave { .close with $_ } ?

[16:47] <AlexDaniel> somehow I just tend to write it by hand: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/2909f0a93207ede4bcbf3efee54109fc39b856f3/lib/Whateverable/Output.pm6#L31-L34

[16:47] <AlexDaniel> less magical I guess

[16:48] <AlexDaniel> greppable6: will leave

[16:48] <greppable6> AlexDaniel, 83 lines, 15 modules: https://gist.github.com/3eaadc506c799f1b3aafe4e9cc870397

[16:49] <AlexDaniel> yep most of these are (relatively) wrong, unfortunately

[16:49] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: are docs wrong, do you think?

[16:49] <tellable6> 2019-11-27T12:01:06Z #raku <tyil> jmerelo currently only my 3 posts are scheduled for the raku advent, do we have any updates from the other people's posts?

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: yep, they are

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> or at least that's what I consider wrong

[16:51] * sena_kun will prepare the posts... hopefully, soon

[16:51] <[Coke]> jmerelo: I think you misplaced a . there.

[16:51] <AlexDaniel> there are two examples of will leave on this page: https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Handle

[16:51] <jmerelo> [Coke]: sorry

[16:51] <jmerelo> tell tyil I'll start nudging everyone

[16:51] <jmerelo> .tell tyil I'll start nudging everyone

[16:51] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to tyil

[16:51] <jmerelo> .tell jmerelo you're dumb

[16:51] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass that message to your doctor

[16:52] <jmerelo> .tell tellable6 that's lovely, thanks.

[16:52] <tellable6> jmerelo, Thanks for the message

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> and while both these examples are minimal and maybe don't suffer from the issue, they don't explain that in real code you'll face it

[16:53] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: just the "will leave", right?

[16:53] <AlexDaniel> here's an example:

[16:53] <AlexDaniel> m: sub foo($foo) { return ‚Äòok‚Äô if $foo == 42; my $fh will leave { say ‚Äòclosing‚Äô; .close } = ‚Äòfoo‚Äô.IO.open; }; foo(42)

[16:54] <AlexDaniel> I don't remember now, but I think there were other examples when LEAVE would fire unexpectedly

[16:54] *** abraxxa left
[16:54] <AlexDaniel> something about multi dispatch maybe?

[16:55] *** abraxxa joined
[16:55] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: it needs to be `will leave {.close with $_}`

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> ah yes

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> these two: https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps#LEAVE_phaser_and_exit

[16:58] <jnthn> Alternatively, .?close

[16:58] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: even though it works, it feels so wrong :D

[16:59] <AlexDaniel> it checks if the method exists and it just happens that there's no .close in Any

[17:00] <AlexDaniel> I remember having this conversation with vrurg recently, and he pointed out that there's `andthen` or one of these weirdly named things

[17:00] <AlexDaniel> and in my snippet back then it made things easier, yeah

[17:01] <AlexDaniel> but here I again wish we had .?-like thingy that'd check for Nil

[17:56] <jnthn> I looked at it and didn't answr it exactly for that reason.

[17:56] <jnthn> *answer

[17:58] <jmerelo> I know, but look at the tiny hand that says "New contributor". Let's try to help. Again, the question is different. They're not understanding what's happening. So let's hold their hand to the correct answer, please.

[17:58] <jnthn> Oddly, they even created a thread pool of size 2 in both questions... 

[17:59] <jnthn> Anyway, I can vote for reopening, but won't because I believe the marking as duplicate is correct. Sorry.

[18:03] <jmerelo> Hey, Altai-man_ 

[18:03] <jmerelo> How are these articles going?

[18:03] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, o/

[18:04] <Altai-man_> erm, didn't I just write about that? my new network is crazy with all these disconnects...

[18:04] <jmerelo> Altai-man_: sorry, where?

[18:04] <Altai-man_> ugh, I can't even change the nickname as `sena_kun` is still a zombie...

[18:05] <Altai-man_> jmerelo, I have the first one like 70% ready (the code is ready, just need to finish wrapping it up as a tutorial), the second one is still in my mind

[18:06] <jmerelo> Wonderful! Did I send you an invitation for the WP site?

[18:06] <jmerelo> Please send me a private message with the email you want the invitation to be sent to

[18:06] <sena_kun> jmerelo, I published an article already, if the site was not changed, then I'm ok

[18:06] <sena_kun> two of them last year

[18:48] <[Coke]_> the site may have changed, but old logins still work, I think.

[18:48] <japhb> sarna: You're welcome.  And no worries, IRC is expected to be async.  We even have a bot for delivering messages to people who had to disconnect and rejoin later.

[18:48] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[18:48] <[Coke]> Unless we didn't rename but created a new site.

[18:59] *** wamba joined
[19:28] <jmerelo> [Coke]: we created a new site. I talked to the person that owned the old site and told me that was the best option.

[19:29] <jmerelo> BTW, I need emails to add you to this new site, msg me with them 

[19:31] <[Coke]> Eh. No need to add me.

[19:32] <jmerelo> [Coke]: unless that final slot is really unfilled...

[20:19] <[Coke]> still trying to avoid writing an article.

[20:19] <[Coke]> Also, we need to post something on the old calendar pointing to the new one.

[20:19] <[Coke]> I am happy to post it if someone writes it up but doesn't have privs on the old site
