[08:40] <xkr47> jmerelo, hmm it's like like mapping a defined value to another one, but leaving an undefined value undefined.. 

[08:42] <jmerelo> xkr47: that's in an Grammar action, right? But undefined values get a default value, right?

[08:42] <xkr47> Nil.map doesn't work

[08:43] <jmerelo> xkr47: Nil is not really an object...

[08:43] <xkr47> I was trying `$<x>.map(sub ($a){$a.made}) || defaultvalue`

[08:49] <xkr47> woo woo now my time calculator can calculate 5d / 2 -> 2,12:00:00.000

[08:50] <xkr47> or 5d / 4m -> 1800

[08:53] <jmerelo> xkr47: congrats!

[08:53] <xkr47> and now I discover there is a type Duration :)

[12:40] <Wahnburger> Hello, i want to count dots "." in a string..i tried the perl syntax but this wont work..does someone can give me a hint? 

[12:40] <jnthn> m: say "foo.bar.baz".comb('.').elems

[12:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9f433da0d: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[12:40] <jnthn> Like that?

[12:43] <Wahnburger> yes, perfect :)

[12:47] <Wahnburger> do you also have a hint regarding the windows/IO-Socket-Async-SSL issue? :)

[12:50] <jnthn> Not really.

[12:51] <jnthn> I guess other than looking through the way openssl is set up inside of the module and comparing it to how the synchronous implementation does it.

[12:53] <jnthn> Oh, though that's assuming it's just a CA issue, but now I see there's some more general problem too.

[13:05] <Geth_> ¬¶ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/fcf46393ac

[13:13] <Wahnburger> I am wondering why this issue is relative rarely reported

[13:13] <Wahnburger> i have tried 3 diffrent machines without success

[13:15] <[Coke]> Wahnburger: is there a ticket? I can try on the windows box I have access to

[13:16] <Wahnburger> here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58647713/problem-with-perl6-and-ssl-on-windows-machine and here: https://github.com/jnthn/p6-io-socket-async-ssl/issues/46

[13:16] <Wahnburger> I have installed the newest version of *star and then i have installed the cro modules with zef...nothing special

[13:17] <Wahnburger> modul with the issue could only ne installed with --force-test :)   

[13:21] *** Altai-man_ joined
[13:23] *** sena_kun left
[13:23] <[Coke]> Wahnburger: why are you trying to run the install from inside a zef .store folder?

[13:26] * [Coke] finds he perl6 installed on this box already and tries a vanilla "zef install IO::Socket::Async::SSL"

[13:30] <Wahnburger> uhmm.yes ...i tried to add some debug outputs to get it after. But the failure messages also happens with zef install IO::Socket::Async::SSL

[13:31] <[Coke]> verified, added my perl6/zef versions, just in case.

[13:31] <Wahnburger> verified what - the failure?

[13:31] <[Coke]> the windows installer version is at least six months old, it's possible the module is requiring something newer.

[13:31] <[Coke]> yes.

[13:31] <Wahnburger> ah I see, thx

[13:35] <Wahnburger> how sad :/  i wanted to put my stuff on the windows server..its LOT faster there that inside thd bsd VMs 

[13:38] <[Coke]> for debug, might be helpful to see if that error was introduced with a release of the module. (that is, can you install an older version?)

[13:42] <Wahnburger> from where?

[13:42] <Wahnburger> ah, i see

[14:08] <Wahnburger> same issue with 0.7.3

[14:25] <jnthn> I don't think I've done any Windows porting work on that module, and don't recall merging any PRs relating to it, so it's quite possible it's never really worked there.

[14:28] <[Coke]> jnthn: I figured it was either "never worked on windows", or "module changed to track something in rakudo that is now too old on windows distro"

[14:28] <jnthn> Could be that also

[14:30] <lucs> How do I get Inline::Perl5 to use the currently active perlbrew perl5? (it appears to use the perl5 that was active when perl6 was built)

[14:34] <Wahnburger> so actual not Cro client apps for windows?

[14:34] <Wahnburger> *actually

[14:35] <jnthn> Windows porting is in the Cro roadmap, but we didn't get to it yet.

[14:36] <jnthn> Though I think most of the work won't even be in Cro, but in dependencies.

[14:36] <lucs> (I did build my perlbrew version, 5.30.0, with -Duseshrplib, and -Dusemultiplicity too)

[14:36] <Wahnburger> yep

[16:37] <lucasb> an anonymous variable :)

[16:37] <lizmat> brass:  that's the anonymous state variable

[16:38] <brass> Oh it's a state variable neat

[16:39] <brass> Found it in the docs, thanks :) https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/state#The_$_variable

[16:39] <brass> It's hard to find these things sometimes if you don't know where to look

[16:41] *** daxim joined
[16:47] <stanrifkin> should i alias perl6 to raku?

[17:02] <[Coke]> in your own install? I imagine that's personal preference at the moment.

[18:20] <timotimo> donaldh: i'm not sure i understand

[18:20] <timotimo> donaldh: is OtherType in your current namespace, or does it come from Class::Generator?

[18:21] *** veesh left
[18:21] <donaldh> Class::Generator creates the new types ParentType and OtherType and exports them to my namespace.

[18:21] <donaldh> I call Module.doStuff(ParentType) and it needs to reference OtherType.

[18:23] <donaldh> Concretely, parse protobuf, generate classes. Protobuf::Reader needs to instantiate classes for sub messages.

[18:24] <donaldh> I suppose I should add resolve capability to generated classes for sub messages.

[21:37] <tyil> is there a way to mimick Moo's around functionality in Raku? (related to the description here: https://gitlab.com/tyil/raku-app-gtd/issues/8)

[21:51] <donaldh> If anyone is interested, protobuf implementation is creeping towards usable: https://github.com/donaldh/p6-pb

[21:52] <donaldh> Forked from illustrious work by samuraisam, japhb, tadzik.

[21:53] <donaldh> Grammar kinda supports protobuf v3 and nearly all tests pass. First successful message round-trip for me.

[21:54] <tadzik> oh, I didn't know I'm involved :o :)

[21:54] <jnthn> donaldh++

[21:54] <tadzik> that's awesome :)

[21:54] <donaldh> tadzik: well, you forked the repo, maybe you didn't actually contribute ;-)

[23:55] <japhb> donaldh: \o/   # I can't even tell you how useful that is to me.  I just ran out of time back then to work on it, and have wanted it at least once a week every week since.

[23:55] <tellable6> japhb, I'll pass your message to donaldh

[23:56] * japhb does his best Evil Laugh while thinking about all the places he plans to use p6-pb.  Mua-ha-ha-ha-haaaaaaaa ....

[23:58] <japhb> Now we just need a gRPC implementation, and I will have Lots Of Fun.
