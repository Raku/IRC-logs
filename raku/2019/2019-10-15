[09:46] <tyil> not everyone, though

[09:46] <tyil> not me and tejr

[09:46] <Altreus> If I were avoiding things because they were in some way harmful, I'd do nothing

[09:46] <tyil> do you also say "pollution is OK since everyone is doing it anyway"

[09:46] <ZzZombo> What do you mean by that?

[09:47] <Altreus> No, I say pollution is unavoidable based on our current technology

[09:47] <Altreus> Or would you have me not work, because cars are harmful?

[09:47] <tyil> you don't have to throw instant strawmans if you want to have a sane discussion

[09:48] <tyil> but by your logic, pollution is OK and we shouldn't try to avoid it, because it's what everyone else is doing

[09:48] <tyil> even though it's harmful, we don't need to care about it, since it's so popular

[09:48] <Altreus> You can't tell me not to use straw men and then use a straw man

[09:48] <tyil> Discord is popular, therefore it's OK to use it, even though it's harmful

[09:48] <lizmat> .oO ( can we not discuss pottery instead )

[09:49] <Altreus> You can't tell me what I said, and then get upset about what you told me I said

[09:49] <Altreus> I said I'm not interested in whatever problem you have with Discord

[09:49] <tyil> there's no need to try and discuss something with someone hellbent on harming themselves because it's popular, indeed

[09:49] <tyil> enjoy yourself

[09:49] <Altreus> I didn't say there isn't a problem and I certainly didn't say *you* shouldn't care

[09:49] <Altreus> I shall, thank you

[09:50] <Altreus> I also use google!

[15:38] <lizmat> indeed... we need to have at least one Rakudo Star out supporting the new extensions before we can consider making changes to the ecosystem

[15:38] <lizmat> probably would need to wait until major distributions have upgraded to a version of Rakudo that supports the new extensions

[16:44] <jmerelo> Just copied the StackOverflow Perl 6 tag info to the Raku tag https://stackoverflow.com/tags/raku/info I don't have wiki edit privs, however, someone else will have to approve that.

[16:45] <jmerelo> I'll edit it as soon as changes start to appear. For the time being, just the (temporary) rakudocs page.

[16:46] <Grinnz> aliasing raku and perl6 on SO was explored before, and should be a simpler solution there

[16:46] *** tamiko joined
[16:47] <Grinnz> so everything doesn't need to be retagged

[16:47] <jmerelo> Grinnz: while we do that (and I have no idea how) the Raku tag was empty and needs some info. If it's eventually wiped out, no big deal. Meanwhile, there's something there to chew on.

[16:48] <Grinnz> I don't know either, i think someone with sufficient karma has to do it

[16:48] <Grinnz> reputation, or whatever it's called :P

[16:48] <lizmat> and the last Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2019/10/15/2019-41-new-wineskins/

[16:49] <jmerelo> Here's the way to rename a tag https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/87437/how-to-rename-a-tag

[16:50] <Grinnz> probably an alias is better first, so perl6 searches still work

[16:50] <Grinnz> maybe it's called a synonym? don't remember

[16:51] <jmerelo> Grinnz: I just tried that. "Version specific synonyms can only be created by moderators"

[16:51] <Grinnz> ahh yes the appearance of version was a problem there

[16:51] <jmerelo> Grinnz: another problem to be solved by renaming...

[16:51] <Grinnz> i guess it should be requested of the moderators

[16:51] <Grinnz> it's an extraordinary case after all ;)

[16:55] <jmerelo> Grinnz: I can't propose in the other direction, also, "Can't create synonym; the 'perl6' tag appears more than 1.25 times the 'raku' tag"

[16:56] <Grinnz> weird

[16:57] <jmerelo> I'm not sure we want either renaming or synonims. We need to convince a moderator to do that, and then the perl6 tag will disappear.

[16:57] <lizmat> I think current "perl6" issues should *also* get the "raku" tag

[16:57] <jmerelo> It's probably much better to just stop tagging questions with Perl6 from now on... There are not so many, and I _do_ have privs to manually delete tags or add new ones

[16:57] <lizmat> that would at least to me, be more historically correct

[16:57] <Grinnz> not sure what you mean by that. a synonym would mean it would not be visible, but it would be searchable

[16:58] <jmerelo> lizmat: I guess we'll have to learn how to use the API

[16:58] <Grinnz> and someone tagging perl6 would automatically tag raku, as i understand it

[16:58] <lizmat> a nice opportunity for a module :-)

[16:59] <Grinnz> just seemed easier to me, but it's up to you of course

[19:09] <ozzy> Hi all

[19:09] <ozzy> I'm having a problem publishing my first module...

[19:10] <ozzy> I requested a CPAN account (via PAUSE), but I'm not receiving any response to request.

[19:11] <ozzy> At the same time p6c is experiencing issues with the distribution of META.list updates

[19:12] <ozzy> Anybody a clue about how to render the module available via/to, for instance, zef?

[19:14] <jdv79> iirc pause accts take a bit of time to get approved

[19:14] <jdv79> what is this issue iwht META.list you speak of?

[19:15] <ozzy> The issue has recently been added to the issue tracker: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/issues/468

[19:17] <ozzy> My first pause request was made on the 6th, almost 10 days ago. 

[19:17] <ozzy> It's not that I'm in a hurry :-)

[19:18] <Grinnz> it's unfortunately a manual process and has been known to get stuck for weeks at a time lately

[19:18] <Grinnz> you can try poking mst

[19:20] *** parkpirk left
[19:20] <jdv79> ozzy: to clarify - i believe Grinnz is talking about pause setup.  ugexe is likely the one you want to talk to about p6c.

[19:20] <jdv79> i pinged ugexe

[19:21] <Grinnz> yes

[19:21] <ozzy> ok - thanks. I was trying to figure out 'mst'

[19:21] <jdv79> mst is in #perl6, #perl, etc... just fyi
