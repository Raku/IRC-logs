[00:36] <tbrowder> .ask nine Using Inline::Perl5,  is there any way  to use a Raku module from a Perl program? I don't see anything like quite like that in the README, nor does it seem likely, but it could be useful.

[00:36] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to nine

[00:41] <Grinnz> tbrowder: wouldn't that be the job of a corresponding perl module?

[00:42] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/pod/Inline::Perl6 - also seems to be nine's :)

[01:02] <tbrowder> Grinnz: thanks! i forgot about that!

[01:03] <tbrowder> and it makes sense, a perl 5 module to use Raku, duh!

[13:54] <sena_kun> bazzaar: o/

[13:54] <bazzaar> After installing rakudo-pkg on OpenSuse (/opt/rakudo-pkg), and installing zef as user, I'm running through the Rakudo Star module list, installing modules to the default modules location (~/.perl6)

[13:55] <bazzaar> It's all going swimmingly, until I get to try 'zef install p6doc' which fails, as it's unable to create directory '/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/doc' with mode '0o777': Permission denied

[13:55] <bazzaar> My question is why isn't it installing p6doc in ~/.perl6 with all the other modules?

[13:55] <bazzaar> sena_kun: Hi

[13:56] <sena_kun> bazzaar: can you provide `which zef` output? if it's using your local zef, then it should happen, otherwise need to do some magic with $PATH to make the local one priority

[13:57] <sena_kun> s/provide/check/

[13:58] <bazzaar> sena_kun: which zef (/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/zef)

[13:59] <bazzaar> sena_kun: raku -v (This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11)

[13:59] <sena_kun> bazzaar: it means that the binary of zef you are using is still the rakudo-pkg one, not local one... maybe El_Che knows the answer quickly?

[14:02] <sena_kun> bazzaar: did you do https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#set-the-path instructions?

[14:02] <sena_kun> `PATH=~/.perl6/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH` sets `perl6/bin` above `/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin`, so the local zef is used

[14:07] *** skyheights left
[14:07] <bazzaar> sena_kun: I ran the script (/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user) before installing any of the modules, and I now have successfully installed around 20 of the R* modules, and they reside in the local (~/.perl6) dir

[14:08] <bazzaar> sena_kun: p6doc has been the only one to try install into /opt

[14:10] <bazzaar> sena_kun: thanks for your help

[14:14] <sena_kun> bazzaar: so updating the $PATH helped?

[14:20] <bazzaar> sena_kun: sorry I didn't see your question, yes I originally ran /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/add-rakudo-to-path, and the local .perl6 dir does occur before /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin in my PATH, this was all done before I started loading the modules

[14:22] <sena_kun> bazzaar: do you have `zef` binary in local .perl6? because it seems like it is not, as `which zef` points to global one

[14:22] <bazzaar> sena_kun: so as all the modules have loaded seemingly in a correct fashion, I assume? that my setup is OK?

[14:26] <bazzaar> sena_kun: yes there is a zef binary in ~/.perl6/bin also which was installed when I ran that script (/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user)

[20:03] <patrickb> Same question wrt CPAN name. I suspect rename is a bad idea for CPAN is it's pretty much write once only... Should I just create a second CPAN identity?

[20:04] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I seem to recall a conversation about this ^ topic you took part in some time ago ... Any clues?

[20:04] <El_Che> github does not recognize *.raku files or files with shebang #!raku it seems

[20:05] <El_Che> is there somewhere we can send a PR?

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: read this: https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: I think it should go smoothly

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> renaming an org is problematic, but renaming a personal account should be ok I think

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: yes, was it linguist?

[20:06] <patrickb> Thanks! I hope to lower the confusion a bit. I've been pretty much throwing my old an new name around at the same time for quite a while now...

[20:07] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: see here for closed issues to get an idea of what we did in the past: https://github.com/github/linguist/issues?q=perl6+is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed

[20:12] <Grinnz> https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/4090 is the latest relevant issue

[20:13] <Grinnz> linguist is indeed what would make that determination

[20:13] <Grinnz> separately, https://github.com/github/markup would have to be told how to render a rakudoc and such

[20:18] <Grinnz> and https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/4149

[20:18] <Grinnz> there was a lot of work to get pod6 both recognized and rendered (not sure if the latter happened?)

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> … sorta

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't fully work

[20:20] <Grinnz> https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1260#issuecomment-466825090

[20:20] <Grinnz> ah the problem was executing the program to render its pod

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: meaning that a repo redirect will stop working

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: keep in mind you can't register another account for your old name, github allows only 1 account per human

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> you can claim that the other account is your bot account (which you can only have 1) but I'm not sure if that's going to fly

[23:01] <tyil> I once got something merged, but that was later reverted iirc

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah, it's different now, no need to think and transform your code :)

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> this should work too:

[23:45] <El_Che> thx, see you tomorrow probably!

[23:45] <Xliff> How can I get tr to work with lexicals?
