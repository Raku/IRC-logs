[01:53] <daemon-boy> Is there a raku equivalent of Perl's Task::Kensho?

[14:30] <mensvaga> I'm writing a module that I think I would like to upload.  However, I'm unsure of what to name it.

[14:30] <mensvaga> It's an object oriented interface to constructing Nagios plugin output.

[14:31] <mensvaga> But, the way I'd name it "internally" (at least, inside my organization) would be something like: edu::university::net::Incident::Report::Nagios

[14:32] <tadzik> the edu::univesity::net is probably more fitting for the :auth part of your module, not its name

[14:33] <mensvaga> Yeah, the thing about it is, that I don't know if I'm "overstepping" my authority to name something like Incident::Report::Nagios , or to design, and subsequently take the namespace for an object oriented hierarchy 

[14:33] <tadzik> the :auth makes it so that you'll never really The Authority[tm]

[14:33] *** AlexDaniel left
[14:33] <mensvaga> I guess I need to read moar

[14:34] <tadzik> you can have yuor Incident::Report::Nagios:auth<mensvaga.university>, I can have my Incident::Report::Nagios:auth<tadzik> and it's all fine :)

[14:34] <tadzik> see https://design.raku.org/S11.html#Versioning for vague spec

[14:39] <mensvaga> OK.  I think I see what I have to do.  Thanks for your help.

[14:40] <tadzik> in general: don't worry about "hijacking" a name too much, it's not that big of a threat in Raku

[14:40] <tadzik> it allows for multiple modules (installed, even) with the exact same name but with different versions by different authors

[14:40] <tadzik> and they can peacefully coexist even inside the same codebase

[15:11] <mensvaga> Yes.  For this, I was experimenting with a "good" example for what I use Perl for in general, and wanted to apply some sort of Object Oriented thing to it.  I'm not in to ITIL (much), but I began to think that Nagios Plugin output was a type of "Incident Report", even if the result was "OK".

[15:12] <mensvaga> But, I'm happy enough with it to actually publish it

[15:22] <xinming_> Is there a upper limit for doing something like   my $promise = Promise.new;   for @jobs -> $job { $promise = $promise.then(-> $x { ... });  };

[15:23] <xinming_> If the @jobs list is really large, Will this be a issue? If so, I'll think a way to avoid chaining promises like this.

[17:34] <xinming_> https://docs.perl6.org/language/concurrency    <--- Here, we have   supply { whenever $supply.xxx { } }       What I try is to replace supply with react.

[17:34] <xinming_> supply { whenever $supplier.Supply { ... } }

[17:35] <xinming_> the Supply.act thing, is almost the same as   $supply.tap(-> { ... })  IMO

[17:38] *** guifa2 left

[17:51] <Voldenet> xinming_: it is possible to fix your snippet by replacing 'done' with '$supplier.done'

[17:51] <Voldenet> http://ix.io/25PM

[17:54] <Voldenet> `done` finishes the supply provided to react before whenever block can run, because 'do-one' is ran before whenever entirely

[18:35] <xinming_> Voldenet: It's a bit strange, that without     done unless @queue    it works, and react block waits there.

[18:36] <xinming_> I think maybe because the program runs so fast, and reacts quit, and stdout buffer is not flushed in this case?

[20:11] <Xliff> sena_kun: I'm trying to make a Cro-based application where routes can be defined in a modular way. Is that currently possible with Cro?

[20:11] <sena_kun> sure

[20:11] <Xliff> In other words, I'd like the ability to define the servers routes across many modules.

[20:11] <sena_kun> include

[20:11] <sena_kun> will help you

[20:11] <sena_kun> ;)

[20:11] <Xliff> Got an example?

[20:12] <sena_kun> Xliff: have you read the advent post?

[20:12] <sena_kun> Xliff: https://rakuadventcalendar.wordpress.com/2019/12/02/crud-cro-http-tutorial/ <-

[20:12] <sena_kun> tl;dr: https://github.com/Altai-man/sample-cro-crud code

[20:18] <Xliff> sena_kun: Looking, thanks!

[20:27] <Xliff> sena_kun: With auth-routes() the first parameter to each route is a Blog::Session. That gets ignored when looking at the actual route, right?

[20:28] <sena_kun> Xliff: hmm, what do you mean? https://github.com/Altai-man/sample-cro-crud/blob/master/lib/Blog/Routes/Auth.pm6#L33

[20:28] <sena_kun> or I don't understand what do you ask, sorry. :S

[20:28] <Xliff> So: "route { get -> Blog::Session $session, 'register' { ... } }" will be /register/ (assuming no include)

[20:28] <sena_kun> yeah

[20:28] <Xliff> Ah!

[20:29] <Xliff> Do you have to pass that session object as the first parameter?

[20:29] <sena_kun> the session parameter gets the session object out of request and check if the types are ok

[20:29] <sena_kun> no

[20:29] <sena_kun> Xliff: you can read the tutorial if you want, how it works in cro is presented in details there

[20:29] <sena_kun> Xliff: look up for `Auth` section

[20:30] <Xliff> So wherever it is in the signature, if it is a Cro::HTTP::Auth derived class, it's ignored in the segment formulation?

[20:31] <Xliff> So: "route { get -> 'register', Blog::Session $session, 'me' { ... } }" will be /register/me/ 

[20:31] <Xliff> And these would be, too:

[20:31] <Xliff> route { get -> 'register', 'me', Blog::Session $session { ... } }

[20:32] <sena_kun> Xliff: it has to be the first argument

[20:32] <Xliff> route { get -> Blog::Session $session, 'register', 'me' { ... } }

[20:32] <Xliff> OK. That's what was confusing. 

[20:33] <Xliff> So the last one would be /register/me/
