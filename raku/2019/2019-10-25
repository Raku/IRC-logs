[13:21] <hythm> SmokeMachine: did you forget `rakudobrew build zef` in the Dockerfile?

[13:21] <SmokeMachine> rakudobrew is not working for me...

[13:22] <SmokeMachine> it was working when I was using `apt-get install perl6` but it was installing a perl6 not recent enough to me...

[13:27] <SmokeMachine> lets see if this way now it works...

[13:28] <hythm> hmm, but the Dockerfile has "rakudobrew build moar" the "zef installl",, you need " rakudobrew build zef" before "zef install"

[13:29] <brass> Hmm the openbsd version of rakudo doesn't come with any of the rakudo star modules like zef

[13:29] <brass> If there any easy way to install modules without it?

[13:32] <SmokeMachine> brass: just install zef...

[13:32] <Doc_Holliwood> brass: yes. install zef

[13:32] <Doc_Holliwood> ^^

[13:32] <brass> But zef isn't an openbsd package

[13:34] <brass> O ok thanks

[13:36] <guifa> For a <fuzzy-match(@foo)> token in regex, would most people assume it to terminate on whitespace or want it to gobble characters prefer to have two separate tokens where one cares and the other doesn’t?

[19:21] <sena_kun> "The other half of each panel shows information about the object: Displayed at the very top is whether it is an object, a type object, an STable, or a frame." colon here seems odd to me.

[19:24] <donaldh> I'm trying to write a grammar rule to match words using a regex but then I want it to reject reserved words. Can this be done in the grammar, or should it be handled in an action?

[19:25] <sena_kun> donaldh, can you show an example of your code?

[19:26] <sena_kun> donaldh, do you use grammar for this specific thing (so we can suggest solutions without a grammar) or?

[23:40] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: How do we declare has_one relation ship in Red?

[23:41] <xinming_> Or, When we use has Model $.xxx    It'll be has_one relationship

[23:41] <vrurg> SmokeMachine: the problem about 'cannot invoke REPR VMNull' will soon be gone.

[23:41] <xinming_> if we use   `has Model @.xxx`      It'll use has_many?

[23:41] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: yes

[23:41] <SmokeMachine> vrurg: good news!

[23:42] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: Also, How can we declare the has_many and make it not null?

[23:42] <xinming_> I just found that some relationships are nullable columns

[23:42] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: you can sat you foreign key as not null...

[23:46] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: Any example?

[23:47] *** redable joined
[23:48] <xinming_> Ignore me, Just figured it out

[23:49] <AlexDaniel> feedback, please? https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/blob/old-issue-tracker/solutions/rakudo/Old-Issue-Tracker-Dismantling-Plan.md

[23:49] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: my head doesn't work properly already, but so far it looks good.

[23:50] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: BTW, there is a bug,   `has Int $.col is referencing{ ... } is column{ ... }`   works,    But `has Int $.col is column{ ... } is referencing{ ... }`   doesn't

[23:51] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: you should be using `is column{ :references{ ... }, ... }`

[23:52] <xinming_> alright, Maybe a note about the differences?

[23:53] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: `is referencing{ ... }` becomes `is column{ :references{ ... } }`

[23:57] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: How is   :references{ Model.id }  translated?  I know that :referens{}  becomes  :referens({ });  inner is a block.

[23:58] <xinming_> hmm, bbl, I'll trymore
