[14:14] <lizmat> would still appreciate the paragraph, or a blog post  (one can hope  :-)

[14:15] <tbrowder> erg, disregard, my foo was barred, mismatch between meta6 and mod name

[16:19] <Kaiepi> they can already be used with TCP if IO::Socket::INET's methods are told to accept PF_UNIX, it's just a matter of handling when bound unix sockets should be unlinked

[20:14] <El_Che> Coma has a weird behaviour with { } blocks. When I type "given $var {" a "}" is appended (great) with the cursor betweens the {}. I type enter to move the end bracket and then an extra '}' is added (bad). The cursor stays at the begin of the new line before the first '}'. When I insert a tab to move the first '}' to the right (align it), the cursor jumps over the bracket (weird).

[20:14] *** stoned75 joined
[20:16] <El_Che> ^-- sena_kun, jnthn 

[20:18] <pilne> not sure if that's comma specific, or based on the underlying inteli-j stuff, i seem to recall inteli-j doing silly shit when i used it for java/kotlin/scala/groovy too.
