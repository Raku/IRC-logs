[22:13] <patrickb> That push was not intentional!

[22:14] <patrickb> Will hard reset break stuff?

[22:15] <El_Che> if no ones pushes after you

[22:16] <El_Che> I mean before the reset

[22:16] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: What do you think? Can I hard reset without some cron job breaking?

[22:16] <El_Che> if that's the case you can revert, but they will stay in the history

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: reverting is safer
