[10:34] <Altai-man_> be careful though that assigning `Nil` returns variable to its "undefined" state and when a default value is set, it'll be it

[10:35] <Altai-man_> for Cro session just `= Nil` should be enough

[11:08] *** tobs joined
[11:16] <tbrowder>  okay, i'm answering my own question: on our modules.perl6.org page, in the search window enter "from:cpan" and search. if you want an author and know his cpan name you can enter "from:cpan author:ANAME"

[11:20] <lizmat> tbrowder++

[11:24] <tbrowder> thnx, and you don't need to know the full name, so using "from:cpan author:ELIZ" i get 102 modules for lizmat!

[11:24] <lizmat> wow,  sometimes I forget there are that many  :-)

[11:25] <tbrowder> lizmat: btw, i snagged RAKU for a florida license plate for my truck and will send a pic when it gets here in a few weeks

[11:26] <lizmat> would be a nice picture for the weekly  :-)

[14:58] <davidholoshka> Hi I have a cro server on port 20000  behind an apache2 proxy.  The cro server stops responding to apache 503 after a random number of minutes ~5 - 10.  Apache reports connection refused.  I see no errors in the trace it just stops.  The processes are still running.  Any idea what might cause this or how I could get it to report a problem ?

[20:16] <brass> I have a question about licenses

[20:16] <brass> I'm used to reading about the GPL and BSD-style licenses, but what does the Artistic License 2.0 offer that's different?

[20:17] <brass> There seems to be almost nothing written about it online

[20:17] *** ufobat_ left
[20:18] <mspo> it's written in pretty clear language

[20:19] <mspo> it's very permissive

[20:19] <brass> But why is it favoured by the perl/raku community over say BSD?

[20:21] <mspo> don't know

[20:22] *** Demos[m] joined
[20:22] <Demos[m]> is this room synced with #perl6?

[20:22] <BinGOs> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_License

[20:24] <japhb> Demos[m]: No.

[20:25] <Grinnz> brass: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ArtisticLicense2 https://choosealicense.com/licenses/artistic-2.0/ may be useful

[20:27] <mspo> apparently Larry wrote it

[20:27] <mspo> version 1

[20:28] <brass> Hm I just read it

[20:28] <brass> It seems vaguely like the lgpl

[20:28] <japhb> Part of the intent of the Artistic License is that people who make modified versions can't claim that their version is standard.  It means that the author of the work gets artistic control over the future of the original version without fearing "silent embrace and extend"

[20:29] <mspo> brass: the interesting part is the "satisfy any ONE of the following conditions"

[20:30] <brass> a choose your own adventure license

[20:30] <japhb> Artistic 1 was often explicitly dual-licensed.  Artistic 2 allows relicensing under 4.c.ii, thus allowing people who want to go pure-GPL to do so, for instance.

[20:32] <japhb> But Artistic 2 is not *itself* viral like GPL is, so those that object to that need not make use of 4.c.ii

[20:34] <mspo> yeah it's nice to give a legal way for people who relicense to gpl anyway

[20:34] <mspo> ;)

[23:03] <xinming> In this case, Why will infix:<+>  work, But not  infix:{'+'}    ?

[23:12] <risorg23> does anyone know of any way to add autocompletion for raku on emacs?

[23:13] <risorg23> as far as i'm aware, only syntax highlighting and checking exists for the time being

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> risorg23: hmm, I simply use dabbrev-expand globally

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> which isn't a proper autocompletion but it works for me

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> risorg23: I use it together with key-chord mode so that the expansion is triggered by keys under my fingertips

[23:38] <risorg23> yeah, i use that too but i wish something like company-raku existed
