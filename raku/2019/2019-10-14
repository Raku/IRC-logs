[13:31] <Altreus> Is `use v6` now deprecated?

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> Altreus: no, why

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> it's still version 6

[13:32] <Altreus> of what

[13:33] <AlexDaniel> Raku v6.d

[13:33] *** ZzZombo joined
[13:33] <Altreus> ah we've introduced a historical reason

[13:33] *** sumanstats joined
[13:33] <lucasb> did it skip 5 versions?

[13:34] *** ufobat joined
[13:34] <AlexDaniel> you mean historical reason to write `use v6` in your code?

[15:26] *** rba joined
[15:50] <Altreus> Having the 6 in the version number certainly contributed to the confusion that culminated in the name change in the first place :P

[15:51] <Altreus> It was never perl version 6, it was perl6 version 1 ...

[15:51] <Altreus> now it's raku version 6 :D

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> Altreus: heh :D

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> Altreus: but no, it was meant to be the next version of perl, sorta

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> initially

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> the idea that perl6 and perl5 are separate came much later

[15:53] *** patrickb joined
[15:57] <lizmat> anyways, I would be in favour of giving versions just letters: so we're now at Raku D

[15:57] <lizmat> working on Raku E

[15:58] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: fucking hell

[15:58] <Altreus> Raku Do

[15:58] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: ?

[15:58] <Altreus> these are still numbers as far as I'm concerned :P

[15:58] <Altreus> I'll change my mind after F ;)

[15:58] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: if we're ready to change versioning, then we have to drop letter nonsense

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: we still haven't figured out how to do versioning at all, btw

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> like where's 6.d.1 and stuff, why are we doing this in branches

[15:59] <lizmat> yeah, I know, was just stating my current preference

[15:59] <lizmat> Raku D.1

[15:59] <lizmat> would be ok with me?

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: here's the crazy thought, right

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: why not use something that everybody else is using

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> and understands

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> like semver

[16:00] <AlexDaniel> why do we have to be special snowflakes with these letter nonsense

[16:00] <AlexDaniel> this*

[16:00] <AlexDaniel> my point: 7.0.0

[16:00] <AlexDaniel> here, released

[16:00] *** Kaiepi left
[16:02] <lizmat> Raku 7.0.0 ?

[16:02] *** Kaiepi joined
[16:02] <AlexDaniel> yep, gonna put a final nail into the ‚Äúso is it released?‚Äù thing

[16:03] <Altreus> well in that case the current 6 could be the middle one

[16:03] <Altreus> 0.6.d = 0.6.13

[16:03] <Grinnz> that wouldn't be greater than v6.d

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> that's not going to work

[16:03] <Altreus> oh right

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> that's not how semver sorts

[16:04] <Grinnz> the only reason moving the middle one to major verison for perl 5 is being considered is because it would still work in version sorting

[16:06] <SyrupThinker> I'd compare the alphabetic releases to C/C++ standard versions. Just that they are not years. 

[16:07] <SyrupThinker> Personally I only see a point in using semver when the standard moves so quick that patches are actually a thing

[16:35] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Please, be a bit more polite.

[17:23] <vrurg> I have spotted a couple of errors in the text, but overlooked this one. And no way to edit.

[17:23] <lizmat> can you change the title?  If not, I would rather you delete and repost with proper title

[17:25] <vrurg> lizmat: It's one way road. I neither able to edit it nor delete.

[18:37] <Xliff> Yes. That's me.

[18:41] <AlexDaniel`> uzl: what do you mean no matrix bridge?

[18:42] <AlexDaniel> uzl: it took 4 minutes for that message to arrive

[18:42] <AlexDaniel> also messages from freenode are doubled

[18:43] <uzl> AlexDaniel: I mean a bridge from Riot to freenode (or the other way around. Not sure) similar to the one for #perl6

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> uzl: the whole freenode is bridged with matrix

[22:25] <moon_child> I have a bad idea

[22:25] <moon_child> if some code is invalid, but there exists exactly one valid code of levenshtein distance N from that code

[22:25] <moon_child> and no valid code of levenshtein distance <N

[22:26] <moon_child> then the invalid code is treated as if it were that valid code

[22:34] <Doc_Holliwood> yes

[22:34] <Doc_Holliwood> that's a bad idea

[22:34] <Doc_Holliwood> lol

[22:39] <moon_child> actually hmmm

[22:39] <moon_child> I think it needs to be recomputed for every line

[22:39] <moon_child> s/recomputed/computed separately

[22:42] <Doc_Holliwood> i am playing with hyper and sorting and i can get 66% speedup sorting in parallel

[22:42] <Doc_Holliwood> https://pastebin.com/xcWBrrMM

[22:55] <Xliff> Rinse and repeat until all lists are empty.

[22:56] <Xliff> AlexDaniel++

[22:56] <AlexDaniel> I wonder if Comma should be taught to do it

[22:56] <AlexDaniel> if it can't already

[23:03] <Doc_Holliwood> XLiff, I did try `$lines.hyper( :$batch ).sort` with $batch being 2500 and $lines having 10K elements,

[23:03] <Doc_Holliwood> however that is slower than a `$lines.sort`

[23:04] <Xliff> Doc_Holliwood: Did you use :$degree?

[23:06] <Doc_Holliwood> To 4 yes. The number of cores on my machine. But that should be the default anyway?

[23:07] <Xliff> Ah. OK. Weird.
