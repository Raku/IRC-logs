[08:31] <jmerelo> It's again that time of the year when no one's have their advent calendar article ready for publication when it should.

[08:32] <jmerelo> So if you said you were going to publish an article and have a slot assigned, please have it ready *now* since I'm starting pushing up a few days articles that were scheduled for later

[08:32] *** benjif joined
[08:33] <jmerelo> And if you don't have a slot assigned, just request one and write the article ASAP. I'll schedule it when I have nothing else to work with, or by the end of the season.

[08:34] <jmerelo> Here's the new and improved schedule: https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2019/schedule Please add yourself at the end, but not before your article is ready.

[08:43] <jmerelo> Hi, n1ge

[08:44] <n1ge> hi jmerelo - I'm on track to submit an entry by the end of the day

[08:44] <jmerelo> n1ge: I'll publish it tomorrow, then

[08:44] <n1ge> sorry if there is some confusion here

[08:44] <n1ge> ok cool

[08:44] <jmerelo> But please submit it today anyway

[08:45] <n1ge> I was just going to put into wordpress and schedule to release it

[08:45] <n1ge> is there a different process than previous years?

[08:45] <jmerelo> n1ge: the difference is that I would like to have had the article a few days in advance

[08:45] <jmerelo> n1ge: to review them, and just to know that they are ready

[08:45] <n1ge> oic ok

[08:46] <n1ge> yes - that's a good idea - sorry I didn't realise

[08:46] <jmerelo> n1ge: but by all means post it now, and I can reschedule stuff, no problem.

[08:46] <jmerelo> I'll try to have a look at it as soon as you post it

[08:48] <n1ge> ok cool - will submit it later tonight - you can decide when it's best to publish

[11:18] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/a319e660c2

[11:33] <jmerelo> chloekek um. Right.

[11:36] *** chloekek joined
[11:50] <chloekek> p6: my $xs := [1, 2, 3]; push $xs, 4; say $xs;

[11:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´[1 2 3 4]‚ê§¬ª

[11:51] <chloekek> I wonder if it would be easier to use Raku with just the $ and & sigils, and := wherever possible.

[11:52] <chloekek> Esp. with immutable lists and maps.

[11:53] <chloekek> @ and % don‚Äôt seem all that useful without the Perl 5-like list behavior, other than the special behavior when initializing them (e.g. my @xs = 1, 2, 3) copies the list into a new array.

[11:56] *** mscha joined
[11:56] <chloekek> $ is useful because it‚Äôs universal, and & is useful because you can do a call by omitting the sigil, but @ and % don‚Äôt seem to have anything special to them other than the non-:= initialization behavior.

[11:56] <mscha> m: my %h{Complex} = 0+0i => 'foo'; say %h{0+0i}; say %h{0-0i}; say 0+0i == 0-0i;

[11:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§(Any)‚ê§True‚ê§¬ª

[11:59] <chloekek> p6: my $xs := (1, 2, 3); my @ys = $xs; say @ys.perl;

[11:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´[1, 2, 3]‚ê§¬ª

[12:00] <chloekek> p6: my $xs := (1, 2, 3); my @ys = $xs,; say @ys.perl;

[12:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´[(1, 2, 3),]‚ê§¬ª

[12:03] <mscha> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3354

[12:05] <jmerelo> chloekek: visibility, maybe?

[12:06] <tobs> I agree insofar as Array and Hash in Raku behave like references already if you come from a Perl point of view (no flattening), but the explicit sigil still helps me discern singular from plural in a variable name.

[12:06] <chloekek> You mean that you can immediately see that it‚Äôs positional or associative?

[12:06] <chloekek> That‚Äôs true.

[12:06] <jmerelo> chloekek: that's what they mean for me, at least.

[12:07] <jmerelo> Admitted this is maybe something that is meaningful only for people heavily invested in Perl before

[12:08] <chloekek> If it‚Äôs about ‚Äúplurality‚Äù one might argue this is not intuitive:

[12:08] <tobs> but I see your point, as referring to an Array through a scalar container is most often(?) not different from a positional container.

[12:08] <chloekek> p6: my @a := set(1, 2, 3)

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´Type check failed in binding; expected Positional but got Set (Set.new(3,2,1))‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[12:08] <chloekek> So it being positional per se is quite significant.

[12:08] <chloekek> Otoh:

[12:09] <chloekek> p6: my %a := set(1, 2, 3)

[12:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: ( no output )

[12:09] <tobs> ^ was about to write that :)
