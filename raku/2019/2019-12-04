[09:16] <jjatria> I'm having a hard time understanding how (List) ~~ (List) is supposed to work, and the meaning of (List)|(List)

[15:55] <uzl[m]> BTW, is there a channel for the Comma IDE?!

[15:57] <sena_kun> uzl[m]: no such channel, but I'm here. :)

[15:57] <sena_kun> uzl[m]: thanks for your comments, it seems that wordpress ruined the code. :(

[16:00] *** pmurias left
[16:04] <uzl[m]> Sure. Regarding Comma, I just wanted to make sure where to ask questions if I had any down the line ;-)!

[16:04] <sena_kun> uzl[m]: here, ping me or jnthn, but better me. :)

[16:13] *** jmerelo joined
[16:16] <uzl[m]> sena_kun: In fact, I had a question the other day. I use Vim and something that I noticed with Comma is that whenever I leave its window by moving to another workspace, I've to click on it in order to enable the cursor back and input text. With Vim, if I'm in Insert mode I can move back and forth and I can always input text without having to click its window.

[16:16] <uzl[m]> I've never used IntelliJ-based IDEs so I'm not sure if this is some behavior inherent to them or because of my system since I'm using a tiling window manager.

[16:16] <sena_kun> uzl[m]: I am having it too for plain idea right now, so it is intellij thing. using i3.

[17:36] <tbrowder> hi, all. there are some theme changes coming on the raku advent site to make it look better, but be patient, jmerelo has his hands full at moment.

[17:39] <tbrowder> in the meantime, he has discovered we now have the ability to change the site's domain name if we want to (but probably not until earlier than mid january)!

[17:41] <tbrowder> any comments on a rakuadvent name change to something like "advent.raku.org" or "christmas-advent.raku.org" or similar?

[17:42] <jmerelo> tbrowder: I think that we can do both. Any *.raku.org can be a simple redirect, but with the plan you've purchased, you can get raku-advent-calendar.org for free, I think.

[17:49] <sena_kun> m: say :42foo;

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «Unexpected named argument 'foo' passed␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:49] <sena_kun> hmm...

[17:49] <sena_kun> ah

[17:50] <sena_kun> m: say (:42foo);

[17:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «foo => 42␤»

[17:50] <sena_kun> ^ in this form of pair literal, only int literals are supported?

[18:00] <tbrowder> jmerelo: the plan's free domain is only for the first year, then another fee annually, but probably less than $20 depending on TLD.

[18:00] <jmerelo> tbrowder: right. I don't what will happen to the customization if you stop paying, though.

[18:00] <chloekek> p6: my $ü = 1; say $u¨

[18:02] <tbrowder> not planning to, but only God knows.  i would like to get TPF support. but first let's see of this plan gives enough css and font flexibility. 

[18:05] <tbrowder> so, a separate issue: if the Raku community wants to change names for the advent site, what new name shall it have?

[18:12] <tobs> weekly: ^ last note was an addendum to: Thanks to unclechu++ for a reminder, there's now a configured Matrix community for Raku: +raku:matrix.org . Feel free to join it (let AlexDaniel know if you need an invite)

[18:41] <lelf> Hi. Is there a shortcut for « make $/<smth>.made »?

[18:43] <lizmat> $<smth>.made    # aka, lose the slash ?

[18:45] <cspencer> i’m trying to do some binding to an external c++ library, but am having some challenges and am getting the following message: “Don't know how to mangle symbol 'tensor::dim' for library 'libtorch.so.3'”

[18:45] <cspencer> does anyone know how to resolve the symbol mangling error?

[18:46] <lelf> lizmat: ok. -1 char. what to do with the rest 17? :)

[18:46] * lizmat doesn't know of any further shortcut

[18:46] <lizmat> maybe someone else does  

[18:46] <cspencer> i’ve been following: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/t/04-nativecall/13-cpp-mangling.t

[18:47] <cspencer> which seems to indicate that i can use nativeconv('thisgnu') to specify a mangling convention, but it doesn’t appear to be working

[18:52] <lizmat> imo, this is not about the AST, but about what you made with "make"

[18:54] <lizmat> right

[18:54] <hythm> but its an alias to .made, if i understand correctly

[18:54] <tadzik> .made is a "new" name

[19:50] <xkr47> I'm making a "jq" kindof tool that instead runs a supplied perl6 script

[19:50] *** wamba left
[19:50] <xkr47> input: string/yaml/json, same output alternatives

[19:51] *** wamba joined
[19:51] <xkr47> I had it for perl5 already, now I try to force myself to learn perl6 with a new version of the script :)

[19:51] <sena_kun> xkr47: good luck!

[19:51] <xkr47> thanks

[19:51] <xkr47> or alternative I ask here :D

[19:52] <sena_kun> that's a nice option too. ;)

[20:00] <lelf> p6: given [42] {when :(Int $x) {note $x}} # is there a way to make this work?

[20:03] <sena_kun> m: given [42] {when :(Int) {note $_ }}

[20:03] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 9b8ce733a: OUTPUT: «[42]␤»

[20:10] <lelf> I don't want [42], I want what is matched by $x

[20:12] <sena_kun> lelf: what are you trying to achieve?

[20:16] *** stoned75 joined
[20:17] <lelf> e. g. cases on empty list / 1-element list / many-element list

[20:23] <MasterDuke> m: given [42] { when *.elems == 0 { say "empty" }; when *.elems == 1 { say "1-elem" }; when *.elems > 1 { say "many-elem" } }

[20:23] <evalable6> MasterDuke, rakudo-moar 9b8ce733a: OUTPUT: «1-elem␤»

[20:26] *** sena_kun left
[20:26] <lucasb> if it fits the problem, it could alternatively be written as some multis with different arity

[20:28] <lelf> MasterDuke: ... I asked how to do it with signatures

[20:29] <lucasb> ':(Int $x)' doesn't introduce a new variable $x in the scope. IIUC, it's just a parameter name

[20:30] <MasterDuke> hm, dunno

[20:30] <lucasb> m: say [1,2,3] ~~ :($x,$y,$z)

[20:30] <evalable6> lucasb, rakudo-moar 9b8ce733a: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[20:30] <lucasb> it matches, but I also dunno how to get those values :)

[23:24] <lizmat> sena_kun: the old or the new one ?

[23:32] <tbrowder> sena_kun: how do you create and enter your posts on wp?

[23:34] <sena_kun> lizmat: both...

[23:34] <lizmat> I guess  :-)

[23:34] <sena_kun> tbrowder: doing a github gist, then using script to obtain html, then paste raw html into editor

[23:36] <tbrowder> it may be too late for this year, but i'm working on a semi-CLI method that might help. zoffix's script was a good start, but it looks to me that WP does things behind the scene (with php) that can cause trouble depending on the actual markup. did you ensure paras were single lines? probably so.

[23:37] <sena_kun> tbrowder: I did

[23:38] <sena_kun> I mean, it is just that it unescaped some characters that WERE escaped. but let other escaped characters be fine. which made the code broken, of course, because syntax...

[23:38] <sena_kun> but I fixed it already, so never mind

[23:41] <cpan-raku> New module released to CPAN! Sanity (0.0.1) by 03UGEXE

[23:45] <tbrowder> yeah, escaping in the gist round trip is weird i think
