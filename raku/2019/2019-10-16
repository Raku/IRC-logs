[07:56] <bbkr> Hi. How and when should ecosystem modules reflect name change? Will module authors get any tutorial describing files extensions, META6.json name, language name in travis-CI, etc?

[08:00] <bbkr> Also will perl6/ecosystem repo be simply renamed to raku/ecosystem or will there be separate repository for adapted modules only?

[08:04] <Doc_Holliwood> in an ideal world someone would write a script that automatically does the lot of renaming work and creates pull requests

[08:06] <tejr> Maybe that someone...

[12:03] <kawaii> I keep getting a segfault when trying to compile Rakudo on my Raspberry Pi :thinki

[12:03] <nine> kawaii: maybe out of memory?

[12:03] <nine> kawaii: does dmesg give a hint?

[12:04] <kawaii> nine: sadly not, nothing in dmesg since boot

[12:04] <kawaii> memory looks fine too

[12:04] <kawaii> 100 mb used out of 1 gb

[12:07] <nine> rakudo compile uses well over 1 GB of memory

[12:09] <kawaii> ah that might be the issue then

[12:09] <kawaii> let me get a reading while it compiles

[12:09] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: any reason you can't use an existing package?

[12:10] <kawaii> `rakudo/stable 2018.12-5 armhf` is the latest in my repos

[12:10] <kawaii> I suppose that will work

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> yup

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> ‚ô• debian :)

[12:10] <kawaii> I've never used the packages before :D

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: zef is also packaged, btw

[12:11] <timotimo> say, why do we get a segfault for oom anyway, rather than a MVM_malloc calling MVM_panic somewhere?

[12:11] <kawaii> ah it's packaged as `perl6-zef`

[14:36] <pmurias> tyil: thanks

[14:36] <pmurias> tyil: I think I'll add stuff how to add a -I when parceling and info on how to use rakudo.js under node.js

[14:37] <nine> timotimo: reporting errors without allocating memory can be hard

[14:37] <pmurias> tyil: but I don't mean it as a general introduction to using Perl 6

[14:37] <tyil> ah

[14:37] <pmurias> well Raku

[14:37] <tyil> it's just a "look at this" kind of thing, more than a tutorial on "this is how you can make something worthwhile"

[14:38] <nine> kawaii: fun fact: since MoarVM byte code is architecture independent, you can just copy CORE.*.setting.moarvm from your desktop to the pi. No need to compile on a seriously underpowered machine.

[14:38] <warriors> so perl6 --version on windows is giving me This is Rakudo Star version 2019.03.1 built on MoarVM version 2019.03 implementing Perl 6.d., is this the latest release? 

[14:38] <nine> And compiling the CORE setting is the only part that really needs all that much memory

[14:38] <warriors> no release since march seems odd

[14:39] <timotimo> yes, we were having A Time with releases this year

[14:39] <tyil> warriors: you're looking at rakudo star, not rakudo

[14:39] <tyil> rakudo star releases at different schedules than rakudo (without the star)

[14:39] <timotimo> ah, yes, rakudo star releases; the rakudo compiler releases have not been as irregular

[14:39] <tyil> rakudo has a monthly release

[14:39] <warriors> i am very sure i installed the latest binary (msi) from perl6.org 

[14:40] <tyil> warriors: that's rakudo star, yes

[14:40] <warriors> hmm

[14:40] <tyil> rakudo star is a distribution containing rakudo, moarvm, nqp, and a number of common modules

[14:40] <tyil> it's intended to be more useful for end-users, so they don't ahve to gather all parts themselves

[14:40] <warriors> (Y)

[14:41] <warriors> üëç

[14:41] <tyil> if you want the montly releases, you'll have to gather all those parts yourself, and compile them yourself as well

[14:42] <tyil> (would not suggest as a "regular" user)

[14:42] <tyil> I'm actually not sure how hard it'd be on Windows, to be honest

[14:47] <AlexDaniel> warriors: rakudo 2019.03.1 is pretty good

[14:47] <AlexDaniel> warriors: surely the upcoming release this month will be even better, I think a star release will follow shortly (maybe next month?)

[14:47] <warriors> thanks , yes i think for me on windows, it should be good enough 

[14:47] <pmurias> tyil: intended it more to be a "look how you run you Raku code in rakudo.js" thing

[14:48] <AlexDaniel> but generally every other release from now on is just slightly more stable and slightly faster, in most use cases not a huge difference

[14:48] <mspo> I haven't tried in a while- is the entrypoint still a shell script?

[14:49] <AlexDaniel> the big difference will come once 6.e is released, which is going to happen in 2020 it seems

[14:49] <AlexDaniel> mspo: not anymore

[14:49] <mspo> AlexDaniel: that's good news

[14:49] <AlexDaniel> mspo: but that changed recently, yes, after 2019.03

[14:50] <tyil> oh, that's pretty neat

[14:50] <mspo> AlexDaniel: is there a way to make a "packed app" like a jar? :)

[14:50] <AlexDaniel> mspo: why is it good news, btw? I know some benefits but wondering why it matters for you :)

[14:50] <tyil> I hadn't heard of that change yet, I'm also on R*'s latest :p

[14:50] <mspo> AlexDaniel: bsd didn't like it

[14:50] <AlexDaniel> ahh

[14:50] <mspo> the shell script

[14:50] <AlexDaniel> .seen patrickb

[14:50] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I saw patrickb 2019-10-15T22:59:32Z in #raku-dev: <patrickb> I'm heading off to bed. 'night everyone!

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> mspo: I remember people talking about packed binaries during perlcon, there was definitely some progress but I don't know the details

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> mspo: patrickb should know more, I think

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: or maybe you? :)

[14:52] <mspo> AlexDaniel: I tried getting my head around the cached compile file names and stuff once

[14:52] <mspo> once was enough :)

[14:52] <tyil> still need to look into automated r* builds with gitlab-ci

[14:52] <tyil> so many projects ;~;

[14:53] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I'm only about makefile infrastructure. Builds are on Patrick.

[14:53] <warriors> what will happen in 6.e is this published somewhere, is there a roadmap?

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW;

[14:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: ( no output )

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> warriors: you can do that to get the latest experimental changes today

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> maybe not in 2019.03 though‚Ä¶

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> warriors: but there are not a lot of changes right now, and you shouldn't depend on them anyway

[14:54] <warriors> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW;

[14:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: ( no output )

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> one of the biggest changes I think is what Grammar.parse returns if it failed to parse

[14:59] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I would add the changes in roles support when merged.

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: btw do we have a changelog for v6.e?

[15:01] <vrurg> Not really. There is a template in the announce document. But I need to pick some time and fill it with updates.

[15:59] <timotimo[m]> it got slashhugged

[16:02] <jmerelo> re: StackOverflow tag shift. We can simply make raku an alias for Perl6 (not the other way round), but in order to do that we need to have 25% more raku than perl6

[16:02] <Grinnz> wouldn't that mean all of the posts still say "perl6"?

[16:03] <jmerelo> That means basically tagging everything that's been tagged with perl6 (and cro, and some other minoritary tags) with raku ASAP, and make people stop using perl6 tag from now on. Wait a bit (or a lot) until we get those 25%

[16:03] <jmerelo> Grinnz: I'm not sure you really can delete a tag, or move it. You can create synonims, though.

[16:04] <Grinnz> yes, but it's my understanding that if perl6 was a synonym for raku, all the posts would then say raku

[16:04] <jmerelo> At the current rate, we'll get to that 25% about Christmas, I'd say.

[16:04] <Grinnz> there's three concerns to think about really: what posts are visibly tagged with, what tags people put on posts, and how people can find the tag

[16:04] <jmerelo> Grinnz: be that as it may, it's still the same requirement.

[16:05] <jmerelo> Grinnz: with respect to the second concern, from today I'm deleting perl6 from all new posts and tagging them with raku.

[16:05] <jmerelo> If anyone else's got the privs, it's probably a good idea to do it too.

[16:06] <jmerelo> There are now, however, 177 questions tagged "raku" but 1201 tagged "perl6"

[16:07] <Grinnz> simply updating all existing posts and watching for use of the wrong tag in the future is an option that solves the first two things, for the third i guess you'd have to rely on the tag description

[16:09] <jmerelo> Additional problem is that you need to be a "Stack App" to be able to write to StackExchange. So adding tags is not really so simply. I wonder if scraping could do the job...

[18:00] <sena_kun> vrurg, AlexDaniel quality of some Russian-speaking communities is as low as it goes, with literaly everything being mocked / hatred there, so while it is painful to see for sure, no real need to be offended, I guess.

[18:01] <vrurg> sena_kun: I'm not offended by the "community". I rather laugh of them as in circus. 

[18:02] <vrurg> What Andrew does worries me because he's a recognized person in the perl community.

[19:05] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I just keep RSS subscribtions from like pre-historical times. They're half-dead and I always forget to unsubsribe.

[19:06] <cognominal> is there a way to print that info from zef itself ?

[19:06] <vrurg> cognominal: You don't need to know this unless you're going to manage the installations somehow. If you need to look into sources then better reach their repos via modules.perl6.org (modules.raku.org soon)

[19:07] <vrurg> cognominal: the point is that modules are installed in a special format which is neither way human-readable.

[19:11] <cognominal> vrurg, So do I need to go to #raku-dev to get a straight answer to a straight question and not be patronized ? :)

[19:13] <Xliff> cognomial: What are you trying to do with the modules?

[19:14] <Xliff> The problem is that module locations are non-trivial to find. At least as, far as I know.

[19:14] <Xliff> All modules are stored on disk in a hash.

[19:14] <Xliff> You can not find them via a nice name like Method::Also.

[19:14] <Xliff> or Inline::Perl5

[19:16] <cognominal> So what is the purpose of PERL6LIB ? or soon RAKULIB ?

[19:17] <Xliff> That's where the hashes can be found.

[19:18] <Xliff> The compiler converts the module name to its associated hash and then looks for that hash on disk.

[19:18] <Xliff> It will look in the directories specified by that environment variable.

[19:19] <nine> cognominal: PERL6LIB does pretty exactly the same as PERL5LIB. But Raku supports different module repository implementations. In addition to the good old "bunch of module files in a directory" structure you know from Perl 5 or Python (CompUnit::Repository::FileSystem), there's also CompUnit::Repository::Installation which is a bit like an indexed data base.

[19:19] <Xliff> Please note that I am just passing on this information to you. This is what I've learned about the module installer. I do not know the whys as to this design.

[19:29] <vrurg> Ok, after all, it seemingly inserts non-emoji but it always displays it as emoji except for the IRC client.

[19:29] * vrurg goes insane about this...

[19:29] <guifa> vrurg: the problem is the way that Unicode handled the stupid emoji non sense

[19:30] <guifa> They retroactively added emoji status to some characters

[19:30] <guifa> You can choose emoji display or text display by inserting VS15 or VS16 after the character

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> guifa: which we don't support yet, unfortunately

[19:31] * guifa is making a keybaord and thought about including the VS15 (text selection) by default but it doesn‚Äôt like

[19:31] *** cognomin_ joined
[19:32] <guifa> Handling VSes are weird.  On the one hand, they‚Äôre not supposed to be semantic at all so theoretically they can be ignored.  OTOH, by virtue of that, people use them to distinguish and they become significant 

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> guifa: I had a custom layout with a bunch of unicode stuff, I didn't use most of the keys

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> guifa: somehow using compose key is way easier

[19:33] *** cognominal left
[19:33] <guifa> It would be great if I had access to the hold-key-down menu that Mac OS will pop up

[19:34] <guifa> But it actually is possible for me to have someone type option-S for Set operators, and then type out whatever it is like ‚Äúelement‚Äù and then the ‚àà shows up

[19:35] <vrurg> guifa: I made a special Perl 6 keyboard a while ago with most important (as I thought) symbols accessible via Opt. Hold down would be better but don't know yet to make it.

[19:37] <vrurg> What annoys me is that there is no way to use to use touch bar. Emojis? Yeah, plenty, use them! Serious stuff? What for???

[19:37] <guifa> Agreed.  The inability for writing quick plugins for the touchbar is like a giant WTF Apple

[19:38] <guifa> OTOH it seems like it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to implement something for Comma.  But that would definitely be bottom of the priority list

[19:41] <vrurg> Aha. So far, I'm ok with opt-key mappings and perhaps will find some time to have hold-down work too.

[19:42] <guifa> I think the hold down requires programming a IME

[19:42] <guifa> The basic keyboard layouts are just XML files which are easy to edit

[19:43] <guifa> (Especially using Ukelele)

[19:44] <El_Che> macos is the worst I have seen in my life for keyboard setup

[19:45] <El_Che> they just took qwerty shortcuts and expect it to be ok on other layouts

[19:45] <El_Che> √≥ == alt + shift + 1 + o

[19:45] <El_Che> that's crazy stuff

[19:46] <El_Che> I had to dive in the karabiner xml stuff to add usefull shortcuts for azerty

[19:46] <El_Che> (luckily it's not my main os)

[19:47] <guifa> What?  I‚Äôve never seen that for √≥.  On US keyboard it‚Äôs opt-E, o, on the Spanish, it‚Äôs ¬¥, o

[19:47] <El_Che> exactly

[19:47] <El_Che> qwerty is OK

[19:47] <El_Che> other layouts: use qwerty shortcuts but don't take the new positions of the chars in accounts

[19:47] <El_Che> -s

[19:48] <El_Che> you know alt+tab alternative alt+` ?

[19:48] <El_Che> the ` is on the right side of the keyboard 

[19:48] <El_Che> so you need 2 hands

[19:48] <El_Che> wtf

[19:49] <El_Che> utter completely garbarge

[19:49] <El_Che> I am one of those people that can fix that (and uploaded the stuff to github :) ), but regular mac users can't. The settings are crap.

[19:51] <El_Che> intenational qwerty with dead keys works well in Linux and Windows

[19:51] <El_Che> so moving from azerty to qwerty there was ok
