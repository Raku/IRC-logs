[00:01] <jnthn> japhb: gRPC is largely HTTP/2 + protobuf, iirc?

[00:10] <japhb> jnthn: yeah, with bidi streaming and some pluggability/automation of the basics (auth, health checks, etc.)  I suspect it would work quite well as a Cro protocol.

[00:12] <jnthn> Yeah, that's what I was thinking :)

[00:13] <brass> Does anyone here use the emacs plugin? I'm running into an indentation error https://imgur.com/a/tHW9I8a

[00:16] <MasterDuke> brass: i don't, but i believe AlexDaniel, tbrowder, and TreyHarris all do

[00:18] <japhb> At one point I considered doing a NativeCall binding of one of the "tiny C lib" implementations of protocol buffers, like unleaded (upb) or nanopb, but didn't have any more time for that than I did p6-pb, so ...

[00:18] <tbrowder> brass: the indention of HERE blocks is a problem. i wish a smart emacs person could solve it.

[00:19] <japhb> brass: I do, and I do see occasional indentation bugs.

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> brass: I can reproduce it!

[00:21] <AlexDaniel> brass: weird, it doesn't look like it should be confused by something that simple

[00:21] <AlexDaniel> you can do this to work around it: if (%.cache{$key}) {

[00:22] <AlexDaniel> brass: but yeah, please report the bug, I think someone is actualy taking caring of the mode now

[00:22] <brass> Do you know what causes the weird indentation?

[00:23] <brass> Ok I'll open a report

[14:50] <brass> I'm trying to write a module using NativeCall but I'm getting these errors when I try to `use` it https://pastebin.com/zwzTrrxb

[14:51] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: https://docs.perl6.org/perl6.xhtml

[14:51] <brass> This is all the module does so far https://pastebin.com/97Gippeg

[14:53] <brass> timo1: what lock?

[14:53] <tellable6> brass, I'll pass your message to timo1

[14:53] <timotimo> hard to tell without a stack trace

[14:53] <timotimo> can you try if running it with "perl6 --ll-exception " gives a stacktrace for those errors?

[14:54] <brass> ok

[14:54] <timotimo> oh, hum, that lock in question can only be the one inside nativecall, or inside each of the subs?

[14:55] <brass> I tried to run using ll exceptions but the error is the exact same

[14:55] <brass> This error is happening just when I `use OpenBSD` without doing anything else

[14:55] <brass> Also the functions appear but they don't work and cause their own errors

[14:55] <timotimo> oh, i wonder if "is native" without a library name there is causing trouble

[14:56] <brass> It's part of OpenBSD's unistd.h so I'm not sure what I would import

[14:56] <brass> If I define the exact same functions in my REPL they work perfectly

[14:56] <brass> They only break when I put them in a module

[14:56] *** Doc_Holliwould joined
[14:57] <timotimo> if it's already loaded into the executable, i believe you need to "is native(Str)", or maybe passing nothing has actually been added at some point?

[14:57] <brass> it seems to work in the repl

[14:58] <brass> I could try passing an empty string I suppose

[17:52] <brass> If I'm exposing some OpenBSD system calls (pledge, unveil), would it be better to export it from my module or declare it as "our sub"?

[17:53] <brass> Any opinions?

[17:58] <japhb> brass: You're creating a module for OpenBSD syscalls, I take it?

[17:58] <brass> Yep :)

[17:58] *** SmokeMachine left
[17:58] <tadzik> brass: well, you can do both I think :)

[17:59] *** SmokeMachine joined
[17:59] <japhb> If so, you should 'is export' your stuff.  Import is lexical, so people can import in a smaller lexical scope as desired, plus 'is export' just exports them for tag DEFAULT.  Users can choose not to import DEFAULT if they don't want to.

[17:59] <brass> japhb: got it, thanks!

[18:10] <Kaeipi> huh, a library for openbsd calls was something i didn't think was needed since there isn't a whole lot to defining the subs for them

[18:41] *** wildtrees joined
[18:51] <brass> Yeah, but if you're writing a lot of scripts on openbsd it's easier to import than redefine them every time

[18:55] <brass> It's also practice for me, since I'm new to raku

[20:08] <colomon> trying to sort out how to handle Latin-1 characters being returned from a  routine called by Inline::Perl5

[20:08] <colomon> called via, I guess a better way to say it.

[21:13] <veesh> or is that a sore topic

[21:14] <discord6> <kelly> who's zoffix?

[21:16] <lizmat> veesh: I sincerely hope so...

[22:33] <timotimo> it sounded a little bit like he's not interested in coming back to programming stuff, but i'd also be happy to welcome him back

[22:41] *** Tirifto joined
[22:44] <Tirifto> Hello! Is anyone here using Emacs to work with Raku?

[22:49] <timotimo> a few people are, not me though

[22:52] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: yes!

[22:53] <Tirifto> AlexDaniel: Awesome! :D What mode are you using for that?

[22:53] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: perl6-mode

[22:53] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: https://github.com/perl6/perl6-mode

[22:55] <Tirifto> AlexDaniel: I've read that cperl-mode should supposedly work with Raku; have you ever tried that?

[22:56] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: any reason you can't use perl6-mode?

[22:56] <Tirifto> Perl6-mode works well for me, but seems to ignore Pod and Heredoc.

[22:56] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: do you have an example? I'd like to reproduce

[23:02] <Tirifto> AlexDaniel: Give this a try – https://coinsh.red/u/55p6modexample.txt

[23:04] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: ahh, indeed

[23:04] <AlexDaniel> I thought it was supposed to look like that? :)

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> now that I think about it, yeah, it should be highlighted like a comment

[23:07] <Tirifto> Well, I can't say for sure what the author intended, but I'd expect it to work more like perl-mode for Perl 5. :P

[23:07] <Tirifto> That is, for that which won't be interpreted as code to not be highlighted as such.

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> Tirifto: file a bug report! I think someone is taking care of perl6-mode now

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> .seen TreyHarris

[23:21] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/3c99680744f5eb6d11cd29e9c1bd25b2

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> if tellable6 gists another normal message I swear I'll kill it

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> :D
