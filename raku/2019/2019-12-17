[09:46] <sena_kun> sarna: what do you want to do?

[09:46] <sarna> why doesn't it work here, but works in this one-liner? `@*ARGS[0..*-2].sort.map: *.Str.IO.rename(++@*ARGS[*-1])`

[09:47] <sarna> it's from the "Raku One-Liners" book

[09:47] <sarna> `@*ARGS[*-1]`'s type is `Str` too :(

[09:48] <tobs> sarna: ++ wants a mutable thing. "hell0" is a literal, but @*ARGS[*-1] involves a container that can store the incremented string.

[10:46] <chloekek> Have a project and want to incorporate Raku somehow.

[10:47] <chloekek> It’s a bunch of Perl (PSGI/Starman, JSON::XS, ØMQ) and D.

[10:49] <chloekek> Maybe I’ll rewrite the integration tests with Raku.

[11:10] *** sena_kun joined
[11:12] <chloekek> It’s got a lot of novel ideas. In that respect it’s similar to Raku. And they’re currently working on incorporating a memory safety system similar to Rust’s (there’s one already, but it’s rather restrictive in some cases).

[11:13] <chloekek> It’s also about as old as Raku. :) Early 2000s.

[11:15] <sarna> I see. exciting!

[11:29] <jnthn> Well, the compiler can't really analyze indirect forms

[11:29] <jnthn> Not in general, anyway

[11:29] <jnthn> Note that if you use this form, then you'll probably also find you can't access lexicals properly in the surrounding context, since it can't tell not to elimiante them.
