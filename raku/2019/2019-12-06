[10:36] <jmerelo> El_Che: but there's still a long way to go if we want to define a synonym. We still need to change ~500 posts if we want to do that. Any help is welcome.

[10:40] <El_Che> jmerelo: I'll try to help when possible now that I know I can

[10:42] <El_Che> I looks like it

[10:43] <El_Che> no api to do it in batch I imagine?

[10:43] <jmerelo> El_Che: APIs in StackOverflow don't have write permission. You need to create an "application", and ask for permission. And get burned in the process.

[10:44] <El_Che> it sounds painful

[10:45] <jmerelo> I think the question was eventually deleted. I can't find it now.

[10:47] <El_Che> is there a negative tag lookup?

[17:38] <tbrowder> tony-o: hear from Jan Schulte, the Travis Engineer, he said he had increased our build time to 90 minutes, so maybe we can roast on Rakudo builds

[17:51] <tellable6> 2019-12-06T17:40:04Z #raku-dev <tbrowder> tony-o  I heard from Jan Schulte, the Travis Engineer, he said he had increased our build time to 90 minutes, so maybe we can roast on Rakudo builds.

[17:52] <moon-child> japhb: the embedding layer is, engine itself is not

[17:52] <moon-child> also embedding layer is also WIP, and I probably won't work on it again until I get a gpu

[17:53] <moon-child> also, ran into a moar bug I should report at some point

[17:58] <tbrowder> tony-o: Some days ago (26 nov) you said you would try to find a way to add capability to roast on a rakudo build, and would contact Jan Schulte:  "ah, danke - i'll whatsapp him once i figure out what i'd like to ask".  He just e-mailed me and said our build time has been increased to 90 minutes, so I'm just informing you--they have been very helpful, and I'm sure Jan would be glad to hear from you.

[18:02] <tony-o> ah okay, sorry i got sick and haven't been awake much or looking at this - i was curious if you were envisioning this happening on travis directly when a MR is accepted

[18:08] <japhb> moon-child: Ah, interesting.  Thank you for the link!

[18:10] <tony-o> tbrowder: testing adding roast here

[18:10] <tony-o> : https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/jobs/621722775

[18:10] <tbrowder> tony-o: hope you feel better, lots of crud around where i am! it would be nice to be able for rakudo admins to push a button on selected builds to run roast, but that may not be possible.

[18:10] <tony-o> oops, fingers are fat tbrowder, see ^

[19:05] <tbrowder> causes early exit from the build

[19:07] *** sena_kun joined
[19:08] <tony-o> could just pipe output to file and print the failures

[19:08] <tony-o> making the assumption that make spectest exits non zero and that i have some kind of bash skill

[19:13] <tony-o> tbrowder: https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/jobs/621748397 <- this should do that ^ right now it's just tailing 500 lines if exit nz from make spectest

[20:47] <tbrowder> can the bash script be modified to output a 0 every few minutes?

[20:47] <tbrowder> or something to fool travis?

[20:48] <tbrowder> and attempts at solution..,
