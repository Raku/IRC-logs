[02:25] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I think you're mostly right. But how much sense would it make spending time on changing those?

[02:25] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: sorry, what exactly?

[02:25] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: .gist :)

[02:26] <vrurg> Sorry, I didn't even noticed the time when you made the comment. :)

[02:26] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: well… I don't know. But we can at least acknowledge the problem and not contribute to it more

[02:26] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: but, eh, imagine writing your compiler and having to comply to .gist just because some existing compiler does it the way it does

[02:27] <vrurg> Sure. I don't mean we must not do it. But this is better be postponed until at least most of the renaming tasks are done.

[02:27] <AlexDaniel> sure, yea

[02:28] <AlexDaniel> I simply wasn't aware of the problem

[02:28] <AlexDaniel> therefore my surprise

[02:28] <vrurg> But added it to my roast todos.

[02:28] <AlexDaniel> thank you

[02:28] <vrurg> I didn't see any until grepped a few minutes ago. Don't like most of what I see.

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> yep :(

[02:30] <AlexDaniel> if I see it right, some of them are not testing .gist but just using the way it stringifies to validate the data

[02:31] <AlexDaniel> probalby should be replaced with is-deeply or similar

[02:33] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: some are subject for isa, some for is-deeply. Mostly, yeah.

[12:06] <Doc_Holliwood> is there an opposite of `require`?

[12:07] <pmurias> Doc_Holliwood: what would it do?

[12:07] <tellable6> 2019-10-19T01:11:01Z #raku-dev <vrurg> pmurias When jvm backend serialize closures does it serialize their respective core setting too?

[12:07] <Doc_Holliwood> as in, is it possible to unload / unreqire a CompUnit, freeing memory

[12:12] <nine> Doc_Holliwood: MoarVM will actually garbage collect code, too. Bytecode files are mmaped, not copied into memory.

[12:14] <Doc_Holliwood> and when does the code become eligible for garbollection=

[12:14] <Doc_Holliwood> ?

[12:16] <nine> When it's not referenced anymore by anything. And that's the key: there are just so many ways an object can become referenced in non-obvious ways (e.g. as part of the lexical scope of the closure of an if-block).

[12:16] <Doc_Holliwood> oh, require is lexically scoped

[12:16] <nine> Doc_Holliwood: anyway, why're you asking about this in the first place? Code is usually not that large?

[12:16] <lizmat> just about everything is in Raku  :-)

[12:17] <Doc_Holliwood> so, i can put a loaded comp unit into a scalar, put it in a cache of some sort and once the cache decides to, it will get forgotten?

[12:19] <nine> Why bother?

[12:21] <Doc_Holliwood> I'm thinking about a concept of a "everything is a node" like framework (like permonks), where each node would just be a piece of raku code

[12:37] <timotimo> sounds like an object oriented database :)

[18:55] <Doc_Holliwood> so i have a bunch of roles and a bunch of methods in an 1 : 1 relationship. is it better to "does" them all in the class declaration, or to use the (self but SomeRole).someMethod pattern?

[18:58] <guifa> I would just put the does in the class declaration

[18:59] <guifa> I find when I get > 2 classes/roles it becomes easier to use “also does Foo” as the first line after the declaration

[19:00] <guifa> Or to put the “also does Foo” right above any methods being implemented for Foo (for example, if I need custom handling for Associative/Positional)

[19:02] <guifa> m: class Language { enum (English => ‘en’, Spanish => ‘es’); say Language::English; say Language::Spanish eq ‘es’; # :D :D :D

[19:03] <guifa> I assume the above won’t recreate the enum for each instance, so this is a pretty slick solution to get readable language code (Language::Foo) that coexist with the Language class.

[20:34] <guifa> I can kind of see why If doesn’t topicalize (if I say “if $a == 4” what is the topic set to?  OTOH, if $_ were set to True, it wouldn’t interfere too much either because presumably in that case no one would use it, but topicalizing may be expensive enough to not do it (or not, I haven’t looked at the internals)

[21:54] <Doc_Holliwood> that's it

[21:54] <Doc_Holliwood> overly clever?

[21:54] <Doc_Holliwood> should i use an if and two returns?

[22:03] <discord6> <noelsken> that with ... or ... construct still needs an if to handle the sentinel value doesn't it?

[22:05] <discord6> <noelsken> I had had "with $x and .so { ... }" as an idea but with hasn't topicalized there yet
