[12:31] <mscha> Is there any way to DWIM?  In other words, pass a Pair to a sub or method?

[12:32] <mscha> Yes, that works, but is there a more elegant way?

[12:36] <mscha> To answer my own question: use 'key' => value, where key must be quoted.

[14:08] <mscha> `last` in my second example applies to the loop in `sub foo`.  Is this a bug or a feature?

[14:10] <lizmat> afaik, it is intended as a feature

[14:10] *** llfourn left
[14:10] <lizmat> just like a "return" in a block will return from the outer sub, not from the block

[14:11] *** wamba joined
[14:11] <mscha> But this is different: it breaks not from an _outer_ loop, but from a loop in another sub.

[14:12] *** llfourn joined
[14:12] <mscha> m: sub foo($x) { say 1/$x }; BAR: for 3...-3 { foo($_); CATCH { say "oops"; last BAR } } # workaround

[14:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´0.333333‚ê§0.5‚ê§1‚ê§oops‚ê§¬ª

[14:16] *** llfourn left
[14:17] <lizmat> ah, I see what you mean...

[14:17] *** llfourn joined
[14:18] <lizmat> I think this has to do with 3 ... -3 being optimized to not be seen as a for loop

[14:18] <lizmat> could you try with --optimize=0 ?

[14:18] <mscha> m:  sub foo($x) { for (^1) { say 1/$x } }; BAR: for 3...-3 { foo($_); CATCH { say "oops"; last BAR } } # workaround applied to the actual problem case

[14:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: ¬´0.333333‚ê§0.5‚ê§1‚ê§oops‚ê§¬ª

[14:20] <mscha> lizmat: same with `--optimize=0`.  Anyway, I encountered this problem in a more complicated scenario, in a `loop` that definitely can't be optimized away.

[14:20] <lizmat> then most definitely an issue is warranted  :-)

[14:23] <lizmat> ok: I think I'm tickling a race condition in precomping

[14:24] <lizmat> scenario: recompile, run "make spectest" with TEST_JOBS=16, a number of tests fail

[14:24] <lizmat> all of these tests use a local test library

[14:24] <lizmat> run the test separately, under make or direct: all ok

[14:24] <lizmat> run "TEST_JOBS=1 make spectest" and all is clear

[14:25] *** llfourn joined
[14:25] <lizmat> then run "make spectest" (with TEST_JOBS=16) and all is fine also

[18:56] <guifa2> I just need to link my module to the article and it should be ready except for two things: emoji in code blocks are going crazy and the codeblock's fonts are too large. 

[18:56] <jmerelo> guifa2: what I did was to upload them as a gist

[18:57] <jmerelo> then you cna edit code and embed them with [gist gist-url]

[18:57] <jmerelo> It looks fine now.

[18:57] <jmerelo> I mean the emojis in code

[18:57] <jmerelo> At least the butterfly

[18:58] <guifa2> Okay when I did the preview, it showed some replacement code (I guess wordpress was s/emoji/<img alt=emojiname>/)

[18:59] *** hacktor joined
[18:59] <jmerelo> I'm adding a link to docs

[18:59] <jmerelo> Hope it does not break anything

[18:59] <jmerelo> I'll revert if it does

[19:00] <jmerelo> Um, it looks fine

[19:00] <jmerelo> Check it just in case, WP does weird things

[19:00] <jmerelo> I'm AFK now, send me an email if there's any problem

[19:00] <guifa2> Weird, on my end it replaces the emoji as <img draggable="false" role="img" class="emoji" alt="ü¶ã" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f98b.svg">

[19:01] <jmerelo> guifa2: as I say, maybe the best is to upload it to a gist if you don't want it changed (and also highlighted)

[19:28] <jmerelo> great

[19:28] <jmerelo> Problem is, the articles for the next two days aren't ready yet

[19:30] <jmerelo> guifa2: it's a great article, lots of high magic there

[19:32] <jmerelo> guifa2: added again the link to docs

[19:32] <jmerelo> guifa2: would be great if you would add links to docs where you saw fit

[19:33] <guifa2> Crap sorry I forgot to make sure I was working on the right version.  Sorry to ruin your work

[19:36] <guifa2> I'll do some of that later tonight (probably a little bit after it posts)

[19:36] <jmerelo> guifa2: just a link, no big deal

[19:37] <jmerelo> guifa2: OK, whenever you can, no big deal either

[19:37] <jmerelo> guifa2: it's just what we want to gather links to the new docs so that they start showing up in searches.

[19:37] <guifa2> Yeah, exactly.  And also helpful for anyone reading the article too :-)

[20:13] <vrurg> .tall Kaiepi There is an error in your article. Int.^name is equivalent to Int.HOW.name(Int), not Int.HOW.name

[20:13] <vrurg> .tell Kaiepi There is an error in your article. Int.^name is equivalent to Int.HOW.name(Int), not Int.HOW.name

[20:13] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to Kaiepi

[20:20] <Kaiepi> ?

[20:20] <tellable6> 2019-12-14T07:39:37Z #raku <jmerelo> Kaiepi thanks!

[20:20] <Kaiepi> it says  `Int.HOW.name: Int` though

[20:52] <vrurg> Kaiepi: in this case. But in genereal, Type.^method is Type.HOW.method(Type)

[20:52] <vrurg> And some methods rely on the first parameter to be the object they deal with.

[20:53] *** sena_kun left
[21:00] *** chloekek left
[21:01] <Kaiepi> vrurg should it be saying `Int.HOW.name(Int)` instead of `Int.HOW.name: Int`? idk how what you said is different from what's written

[21:02] <vrurg> Kaiepi: It should to avoid misguidance. People would be wondering why Type.^method acts differently sometimes from Type.HOW.method. The difference is in the parameter.

[21:03] <Kaiepi> ahh, aight

[21:03] <vrurg> So, basically, when you do Type.^method, Raku's method signature is method(HOW: Mu \type-object)

[21:07] <vrurg> Kaiepi++ for the rest of the article; i.e. for 99.99% of it. :D
