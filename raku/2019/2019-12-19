[12:32] <chloekek> Hmm, seems you can’t use » with a block.

[12:40] *** jmerelo left
[12:41] <lizmat> chloekek: why are you := the @e, and not = ?

[12:41] <lizmat> also, using >>. with say is bad, as the order in which >>. will execute, is not defined

[12:48] <tobs> lizmat: but `say @e»...` is fine, because the .hyper-computed list is printed after it has been assembled, right? It is `@e».say` which prints in undefined order.

[12:48] <lizmat> ah, duh

[12:48] <lizmat> yes, tobs++

[12:49] <lizmat> (glad someone is paying attention :-)

[12:54] *** lucasb joined
[13:06] <chloekek> lizmat: using := because I have no reason for it to be an Array

[13:06] <chloekek> I’m not going to mutate the elements.

[13:08] <lizmat> especially if something is a Seq

[13:09] <chloekek> In fact I plan on making this one a global with our so I really want it to be immutable.

[13:09] <lizmat> m: my @a := 1...10; dd $_ for @a

[13:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in binding; expected Positional but got Seq ($((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:09] <chloekek> Yeah I ran into that some times.

[13:09] <lizmat> ok  :-)

[13:09] <lizmat> chloekek: why not make it a constant then ?

[13:10] <chloekek> p6: constant @foo = 1, 2, 3; @foo[0] = 5;

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «Cannot modify an immutable List ((1 2 3))␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:10] <chloekek> EXTREMELY INTERESTING

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «("a", "b", "c")␤»

[13:10] <chloekek> p6: constant @foo = 1, 2, 3; say @foo.WHAT

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «(List)␤»

[13:10] <chloekek> p6: our @foo = 1, 2, 3; say @foo.WHAT

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «(Array)␤»

[13:10] <lizmat> m: our constant @a = <a b c>; dd @a

[13:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «("a", "b", "c")␤»

[13:11] <lizmat> you can make it an our as well

[13:11] <chloekek> p6: constant %x = set(1, 2, 3); say %x.WHAT

[13:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «(Set)␤»

[13:11] <chloekek> It appears constant keeps the type of the RHS.

[13:11] <lizmat> yes, it should  :-)

[13:11] <chloekek> Thanks, I’ll use constant.

[13:11] <chloekek> Is constant := the same as constant?

[13:11] <chloekek> p6: constant @xs := 1, 2, 3;

[13:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: ( no output )

[13:12] <lizmat> it is afaik, but I don't like it

[13:12] <lizmat> :-)

[13:12] <chloekek> Fancy.

[13:12] <jnthn> = in an initialization is generally subject to semantics that differ from ordinary use of `=` in some way; in the case of a constant, yes, it binds.

[13:13] <Kaiepi> when using the `is pure` trait with multiple dispatch, would you use it with the proto routine, the multis, or both?

[13:13] <tellable6> 2019-12-19T06:35:20Z #whateverable <jmerelo> Kaiepi thanks!

[13:13] <jnthn> Should probably go on the proto if the optimizer is to pay attention to it

[13:13] <Kaiepi> that's what i thought, but i wasn't sure

[13:13] <Kaiepi> thanks

[13:14] <chloekek> p6: our constant @archive-extensions = <.tar.gz .tgz .zip>; my @rsync-includes := ‘*/’, |@archive-extensions.map({ “/id/*/*/*/Perl6/*$_” }); say @rsync-includes.map({ “--include=$_” });

[23:55] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: fwiw, there is no COMPOSE phaser implemented; it was once speculated, somehow made it into the grammar to be parsed, but never got any semantics.

[23:56] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: It's actually a bit pointless too, because it'd run at role composition time, but *the role's body runs at composition time*, so it doesn't really add any new power even if implemented. 

[23:56] <jnthn> Probably something to rip out.

[23:57] <Xliff> jnthn: OK. So what mechanism can I use to perform an action when a role is composed to a class?

[23:58] <SmokeMachine> Yes... I knew that... but a few days ago I could swear I saw someone using that and that worked!

[23:58] <Xliff> Would I have to use the MOP?

[23:58] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: Did you check the IRC logs?

[23:58] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: just put the code on the role’s body...
