[01:39] <dominix> hi everyone

[01:39] <tellable6> 2019-09-28T14:05:51Z #perl6 <uzl[m]> dominix https://mobile.twitter.com/zoffix/status/1159590283627155456 https://mobile.twitter.com/zoffix/status/1171193530624221184

[01:39] <tellable6> 2019-09-28T14:08:03Z #perl6 <uzl[m]> dominix It seems Zoffix is up to something entirely different. I guess the best we can do is wish Zoffix all the best in this new life endeavor. Although I hope he reconsiders. 😃�

[02:02] *** ToddAndMargo12 left
[02:07] <dominix> I am observing a weird thing, and don't know if its a feature or a bug

[02:07] <dominix> if I write say (5,7,-3,2).minmax

[02:07] <dominix> I got -3..7

[02:07] <dominix> but what is this result ?

[02:08] <dominix> p: say (5,7,-3,2).minmax.elems 

[02:08] <dominix> m: say (5,7,-3,2).minmax.elems 

[02:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e7aa2626: OUTPUT: «11␤»

[02:08] <vrurg> dominix: http://docs.perl6.wakelift.de/routine/minmax

[02:08] <dominix> so it is evaluated as -3 ... 7 ? right ?

[02:09] <dominix> I would have see it as a list of two elements, a min and a max.  

[02:09] <vrurg> dominix: the doc clearly states 'returns a range'. 

[02:10] <vrurg> m: say (5,7,-3,2).minmax.minmax

[02:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e7aa2626: OUTPUT: «(-3 7)␤»

[02:10] <vrurg> ^ this is how you get two elems.

[02:10] <dominix> ho man ! what a tricky 

[02:11] <dominix> I would have made this two different functions, like minmaxrange and minmax (pair)

[02:12] <vrurg> Range and Supply are special cases. minmax on Range is different.

[02:12] <dominix> m: say (5,7,-3,2).minmax.minmax.elems 

[02:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e7aa2626: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[02:12] <dominix> ho god !

[02:13] <vrurg> m: say (5,7,-3,2).minmax.bounds

[02:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e7aa2626: OUTPUT: «(-3 7)␤»

[02:13] <vrurg> ^ That'd be more correct use.

[02:16] <dominix> thanks, I got it now, but is was a WTF sequence for me to get to it.

[02:17] <vrurg> greppable6: minmax

[02:17] <greppable6> vrurg, 140 lines, 11 modules: https://gist.github.com/0d58f0013202a19a5dcf84cbdd7a3369

[02:52] <AlexDaniel> uzl[m]: well, another thing we can do is make sure we don't cause such pain to devs in the future

[02:53] <AlexDaniel> uzl[m]: by pain I mean, like, in the bum

[02:54] <AlexDaniel> because Zoffix was doing a lot of great work but then they'd bump into issues that were a bit out of their control

[02:54] <AlexDaniel> e.g. the naming thing

[02:54] <AlexDaniel> at the time, we didn't have any framework on working on such issues

[02:55] <AlexDaniel> so Zoffix did their absolute best to improve things, which got a lot of backlash because some individuals thought that Zoffix is trying to impose their solution/view on others without consensus

[02:56] <AlexDaniel> I mean, “consensus” because there was nothing to define what it is

[04:33] <elcaro> dominix_: I think the confusion is that - on a list of numbers, .minmax returns a Range... and on a Range, .minmax returns a list of (2) numbers

[04:35] <elcaro> ideally .minmax should be consitent... but if that was the case, Range.minmax would just return itself... which isn't very useful. maybe Range.minmax should be renamed to indicate it is a different method

[15:10] <vrurg> SmokeMachine: I think you should apply. Red is assuredly one of the gems in Raku ecosystem. 

[15:16] <SmokeMachine> vrurg: thanks! :)

[15:24] <sena_kun> SmokeMachine, you certainly should! I think that the whole community will only win if Red will be more polished and "production-ready" - less bugs, more documentation and possibly speed would be awesome. Just make sure to write it out properly: particular acceptance criteria and so on.

[15:30] <sena_kun> it is also a cool project to show off raku in general, but I think it has its own papercuts. :/ e.g. IIRC I wasn't able to create a model named User with sqlite when I tried it out.

[15:31] <sena_kun> `'user' is an invalid table name for driver Red::Driver::SQLite` is the error

[15:36] <SmokeMachine> sena_kun: the database do not accept it… you can do `model User is table<another_name> {…}`

[15:38] <sena_kun> SmokeMachine, while arguably more obscure than necessary, I'd expect it to automatically do another name for me, maybe _user or something. Maybe that's just me, but I found `class User`(`model User`) natural.

[15:39] <sena_kun> and when it says to me "You can't do that" I know why I can't, but it feels like not the best experience for the end user.

[15:44] *** Altai-man_ joined
[15:44] <SmokeMachine> sena_kun: it makes sense...

[15:45] *** sena_kun left
[15:46] <SmokeMachine> sena_kun: But what would be worst? not being able to create the table, finding out that you could use `is table<>` for that and making it work, or creating the table an not finding it because the name of the table is different of what you would expect?

[17:14] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: in my view we need (at least) 1 good and feature complete webapp/rest app framework (with oauth/openid-connect support) and 1 db interface. With these 2 a lot of simple projects could be written in raku.

[17:16] <Wahnberger> :)

[17:17] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: not talking about ORM, per se. But something likethat lets you easily do CRUD, even close to SQL.

[17:18] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: so you think that shouldn’t be Red?

[17:18] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: at the moment is RED the one that probably can get there the fastest

[17:19] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: not, I think that Red had the biggest chance to become the DBI/DBM alternative

[17:19] <SmokeMachine> :)

[17:19] <El_Che> (my point is that easy-db-support-for-trivial-thing is more important that the high-end orm stuff

[17:19] <El_Che> in my view, of course)

[17:20] <El_Che> I thinking small webapps/rest services where the db part can be rather trivial crud

[17:23] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: so, if you have the time, I think most people would be thrilled by your possible grant

[17:23] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: I think makes sense (about `easy-db-support-for-trivial-thing is more important that the high-end orm stuff`)

[17:25] <El_Che> So, if you keep that in mind, combined with Cro, it's something very significant for the ecosystem

[17:28] <Wahnberger> El_Che: confirmed 

[17:29] <Wahnberger> the very most users are developing small stuff..and this has to done very quickly i guess

[17:31] <El_Che> I ma doing small rest apis in Go nowadays, but more often than not they don't need the speed, so a few projects could be done in Cro+Red. I wrote a small Cro app in the pre-Red Days, but the db part wasn't great

[17:31] <El_Che> so I put it on hold

[17:32] <Wahnberger> i am still using perl on *nix boxes but I am working on to move all that (old crappy) stuff to perl6...atm a working cro setup on windows would be great :)

[17:32] *** cognominal joined
[17:33] <El_Che> Wahnberger: use docker to develop? Less painfull than native windows

[17:33] <El_Che> Wahnberger: there is docker (with a smallish hyperv vm transparantly hidden) and the WSL

[17:33] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: I’ve already started plaing with that: https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red

[17:34] <El_Che> Wahnberger: I wouldn't bother with native Windows except if you plan to deploy on that OS

[17:34] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: that is great! Session management is a PITA and nowadays you always deploy on several containers 

[17:35] <Wahnberger> yes, it sould run on that windows box..its all small stuff, but very important for my (small) company

[17:35] <Wahnberger> and only inhouse

[17:37] <El_Che> (new Cro is out!)

[17:38] <El_Che> Wahnberger: if I look at our environment, Linux deployment is very automated (repos, CI, orchastration, monitoring, load balancing, etc etc). The Windows part is pretty... artesanal

[17:49] <Wahnberger> i have tried it with several hosts - other libs, like WWW are working well

[21:39] <LtStaffel> I'm nearly a complete noob with Raku but if there's a way I could try to help I'd like to

[21:40] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: it's not that difficult to write a Red Driver... (I mean for SQL... NoSQL I don't know yet...)

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: hiii! :)

[21:52] <kawaii> Yes hello Alex I've been away for a while :)

[21:53] <kawaii> It's nice to be missed

[21:53] <kawaii> You can have a Blin tomorrow

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: no need! We figured it out, I think!

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: El_Che++ finished the dockerizing, maettu++ has a machine set up to run it

[21:53] * kawaii vanishes forever

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> nooo

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> well, we still need to somehow run it automatically and share the results, or something like that

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: as far as the release goes, technically it's ready, just waiting for moarvm release and then there's some paperwork left to do (like changelogging and stuff)

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> but all blockers are resolved and results from Blin seem to be clean

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: so, I'm merging this? https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/pull/83
