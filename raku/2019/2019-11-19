[11:36] <tbrowder> \o

[11:37] <tbrowder> g'day #raku, question if you please:

[11:40] <tbrowder> given a tree class, the user inserts a key. if dup keys are not allowed, how to respond. two ways: be silent, or give a reply

[11:41] <tbrowder> use is something this if i want to be silent: $tree.insert: key

[11:41] *** angelds joined
[11:41] <Ulti> tbrowder: I would expect an exception if its related to the behaviour of the data structure

[11:41] <jnthn> One other approach I've seen used in collection libraries is to use a boolean to indicate if something was actually inserted, which is testable if one cares, but easily ignored otherwise.

[11:41] <tbrowder> or if i want to pass a response: my $resp = $tree.insert: dupkey

[11:42] <jnthn> The trouble for a general tree class is that there's no generally good answer, though; it all depends on its application.

[11:43] <jnthn> Inserting a duplicate might be totally harmless (and the deduplication provided by the tree is welcome) or a sign of a problem.

[11:43] <tbrowder> jnthn: that's the approach i want but how do i avoid useless sink warning?

[11:44] <tbrowder> i could as you say set a flag on each insertion

[11:44] *** jaldhar_ left
[11:44] <jnthn> Booleans don't give a useless sink warning?

[11:44] *** jaldhar_ joined
[11:44] <jnthn> m: class Tree { method insert() { False } }; Tree.insert;

[11:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: ( no output )

[11:44] <Ulti> typically on insert I kind of expect the actual item to be returned or something nullish

[11:44] <tbrowder> no, i was thinking about a return to caller

[11:46] *** jaldhar_ left
[11:46] *** jaldhar_ joined
[11:46] <tbrowder> ok, i was naively thinking of returning say -1

[11:47] <tbrowder> so false would be great, caller wouldn't have to check if he didn't care

[11:48] <tbrowder> Ulti: thnx

[11:48] <tbrowder> jnthn: thnx

[11:49] <tbrowder> jnthn: i filed issue with comma, not working for me on deb buster

[11:49] <Ulti> is there a reason not to return the item or Nil? this allows for larger expressions

[11:50] <tbrowder> Ulti: i'm considering allowing various options for the user, and how to implement them

[11:51] <tbrowder> you know, feature creep!

[11:51] <Ulti> can I recommend not doing that

[11:51] <Ulti> from at least my own experience :3

[11:52] <tbrowder> yep, but i year for attention ;-)

[11:52] <Ulti> or perhaps consider doing it as implementing types of some role which is your more abstract basic functionality thats agreed upon

[11:52] <tbrowder> *yearn

[11:53] <tbrowder> yes, i have considered the role and thinking about best way to do it

[11:54] *** jaldhar_ left
[11:54] *** jaldhar_ joined
[11:55] <tbrowder> then considering how to package it, but the nits i'm asking here i don't think are good for role def

[11:56] <tbrowder> i'm thing e.g. role for basic binary tree, then different varieties use that as base

[11:56] <tbrowder> red-black, avl, etc.

[11:57] <Ulti> it would be kind of nice if there was a built in tree type and thats what actions/grammars were dealing with a special case of as the action pattern for sort of mapping over a tree is generic

[11:59] <tbrowder> think jnthn would consider new raku built-ins!

[12:00] <tbrowder> log2 would be handy

[12:01] <lizmat> do we know who controls the @rakuorg Twitter handle ?

[12:02] <tbrowder> not i

[14:31] <pmurias> [Coke]: seems resonable, the JVM backend seems to have a JVM tag on those so maybe the rakudo.js ones should have a JS tag

[14:35] <MitarashiDango[m> Silly thing I did today: Put "X" in an enum which broke my attempts to .new exceptions 🤦

[14:35] <[Coke]> pmurias: (e.g. it doesn't work with App::Uni)

[14:38] <[Coke]> ah, no looks like it was building everything first.

[15:02] <[Coke]> how long did it take you to run "run_all_tests" ?

[15:02] <[Coke]> I ended up killing it and just running a few tests one at a time.

[15:08] *** Altai-man_ joined
[15:11] *** sena_kun left
[15:19] <pmurias> [Coke]: I don't remember the exact number of ours right know, I run it over night. 

[15:19] <pmurias> [Coke]: it takes such a long time because every test files ends up bundled with the entire rakudo.js and then loaded into a freshly opened chrome tab

[15:23] <pmurias> [Coke]: it's a very inefficent way of running the test suit but with others I was sometimes having random Chrome crushes due to loading a huge js file for a bazillion test files so I did it that way

[15:24] <[Coke]> Sounds good.

[15:25] <[Coke]> Team - anyone else here try out rakudo.js? Getting some community feedback would definitely help pmurias here.

[15:25] <[Coke]> I did have fun with the in-browser sandbox.

[17:39] <El_Che> [Coke]: are you the channel owner?

[17:45] <[Coke]> on IRC? nope.

[17:49] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: so, the forwarding was discussed at the start of the whole thing

[17:49] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: mst adviced against it, although I'm not convinced by the justification

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> case in point: mst themselves have not reconfigured their client to join #raku

[17:57] <El_Che> lol

[17:57] <El_Che> Do you remember what was the reason for not fwding?

[18:00] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: something about people not reconfiguring their client and permanently relying on the forward

[18:00] <AlexDaniel> and somehow forwards are not meant to be permanent

[19:10] <guifa> So in CLDR everything using camelCase.  Should I prefer references that way for ease of porting, or convert them to kebab-case for raku-ness?

[19:33] * guifa just threw up a poll on FB 

[19:37] <wildtrees> how could I join ('A'..'Z') and ('a'..'z') ?

[19:41] <wildtrees> ~ seems to work 

[19:42] <wildtrees> hmm ~ is not totally doing what I want :(

[19:46] <Manifest0> Hi! Shouldn't the variable $<> have the same behaviour on Str.subst and on str ~~ s/// ? 

[19:48] <tobs> wildtrees: ~ is string concatenation. If you want to join them as lists:

[19:49] <tobs> m: my @a = |('A' .. 'Z'), |('a' .. 'z'); say @a

[19:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «[A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]␤»

[19:49] *** joule joined
[19:49] <tobs> m: my @a = flat ('A' .. 'Z'), ('a' .. 'z'); say @a

[19:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «[A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]␤»

[19:50] <tobs> i.e. just use a comma and flatten the result (otherwise you will have a list containing two elements of type Range).

[19:52] <Manifest0> p6: my $a="aabaaaabaaba"; say $a.subst(/([b])/, " $<> ", :g); $a ~~ s:g/([b])/ $<> /; say $a

[19:53] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> m: say ([~] "A".."Z") ~ ([~] "a".."z")

[19:53] <evalable6> theangryepicbanana, rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz␤»

[19:53] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> yay

[19:54] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> wildtrees: is that what you wanted?

[19:55] <wildtrees> I think flat is working for my purposes discord6 

[19:55] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> ok

[19:55] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> btw I'm on the discord bridge

[19:55] <discord6> <theangryepicbanana> so I'm theangryepicbanana

[19:55] <wildtrees> yea I just figured that out! 

[19:56] <tobs> Manifest0: I'm not even sure what $<> should be, or if it is the same thing in both contexts

[19:57] <tobs> It could either be the anonymous state variable $ but deconted, or a lookup of the empty key in $/ ...?

[19:57] <Manifest0> well the documentation on the subst method says: There is an in-place syntactic variant of subst spelled s/matcher/replacement/ and with adverb following the s or inside the matcher.

[19:58] <Manifest0> i'm assuming it should behave the same on both cases

[20:02] <Manifest0> i was trying to do the equivalent to s/(b)/ $& /g; on p5, but with the subst method

[20:02] <tobs> ah, I think I get it.

[20:04] <wildtrees> m: (|('a'..'z'),|('A'..'Z')).pick(8).join.say 

[20:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «AXagULdi␤»

[20:04] <wildtrees> whats the | do there? 

[20:04] <tobs> It apparently is in both cases a zen slice over $/, so pretty much $&, but in the method call version, you're interpolating it into an argument before calling subst, so it hasn't matched yet.

[20:06] <tobs> s/// is apparently lazier with the substitution string.

[20:07] <tobs> m: my $a="aabaaaabaaba"; say $a.subst(/([b])/, { " $<> " }, :g);

[20:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «aa b aaaa b aa b a␤»

[20:08] <tobs> you can make the method work lazily by passing a code block instead of the bare string

[20:09] <Manifest0> tobs: Nice :-) I didn't though about that 

[20:49] *** joule left
[21:14] <tobs> wildtrees: the bar constructs a Slip of its argument. It takes the Range object you apply it to and makes it *slip* into an outer list. So you get one long list containing the elements of both ranges, instead of a two-element list containing just two Range objects. Raku does not auto-flatten like Perl and in cases where that behaviour is needed, | works.

[21:15] <tobs> see https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#prefix_| for specifics

[21:17] <wildtrees> is there a way I can flat a list of lists of list of lists etc... just one level? 

[21:18] <wildtrees> flat seems to flatten all levels down to a single level 

[21:22] <tobs> wildtrees: I think you could map the list of lists through *.Slip. That makes a new list into which the contained list will now slip:

[21:23] <tobs> m: my @a = ['1', [['2', ['3'], ['4', '5']], '6'], '7']; say @a; @a .= map: *.Slip; say @a

[21:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed8f5141f: OUTPUT: «[1 [[2 [3] [4 5]] 6] 7]␤[1 [2 [3] [4 5]] 6 7]␤»

[21:23] *** Kaeipi left
[21:25] <wildtrees> whats .= ? like += but using a method? 

[21:25] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:25] <tobs> (where, if you're new to Raku but proficient in Perl, that `@a .= map: *.Slip` is roughly `@a = map { $_.Slip }, @a` which is equivalent Raku but closer to Perl)

[21:26] <tobs> wildtrees: you got it, exactly

[21:27] <wildtrees> whats the *. doing? is it like $_ at all? 

[21:28] *** Xliff joined
[21:29] <tobs> yes, *.Slip is like { $_.Slip } but you don't have to write the braces. See https://docs.perl6.org/type/Whatever

[21:29] <Xliff> Can you use Cro::HTTP::Client to make AJAX requests? If so, can someone give an example?
