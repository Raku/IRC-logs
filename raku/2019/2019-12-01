[04:38] <mister_flash> hi

[04:38] <mister_flash> What is happening to Perl ???

[04:43] <AlexDaniel> mister_flash: seems to be going strong

[04:44] <AlexDaniel> mister_flash: perl5 keeps improving and perl6 (now Raku) is getting its own identity :)

[04:45] <mister_flash> So perl6 does not exist yet ?

[04:45] <mister_flash> perl 5 is the latest perl version ?

[04:46] <AlexDaniel> mister_flash: first release of raku (back when it was still called perl6) was in 2015

[04:47] <mister_flash> So perl6 appellation should be ban

[04:48] <AlexDaniel> mister_flash: sorry, what do you mean?

[04:50] <mister_flash> The word "perl6" should be remove everywhere since it causes misunderstandings.

[04:50] <AlexDaniel> mister_flash: yes, correct, that's what we've been doing :)

[04:51] <mister_flash> nice.

[04:51] <AlexDaniel> as for perl5, the latest version seems to be v5.30.1 released just a month ago

[04:53] <mister_flash> I wonder if Perl will not be deprecated.

[04:54] <AlexDaniel> I don't think perl5 should be deprecated. It is nice and it keeps getting better.

[04:54] <AlexDaniel> Raku is a separate language now, yes it is very inspired by perl5 but it doesn't attempt to deprecate perl5

[04:56] <mister_flash> but It will shade i

[04:56] <mister_flash> it

[04:57] <AlexDaniel> I hope it will shade other languages equally :)

[04:58] <mister_flash> If it could shade Python it will be more than a dream

[04:59] <mister_flash> but I no longer dream

[04:59] <Xliff> Yeah. It has a long road ahead if it is to do that.

[04:59] <AlexDaniel> well, I personally already use Raku for writing things for which I would have used Python if Raku didn't exist

[05:00] <Xliff> Getting the language bindings and attaining some percentage of module parity will be a big help.

[05:00] <AlexDaniel> I understand it's subjective, but it's already the case for me

[05:03] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: just a single web framework can do wonders :)

[05:03] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: Red seems to be on its way so that's one missing piece done

[05:05] *** stoned75 left
[05:06] *** stoned75_ left
[05:07] <Kaiepi> >v5.30.1

[05:07] <Kaiepi> shit the book i got to learn it a while ago is way out of date then

[05:11] <Kaiepi> AlexDaniel, what are some of the other missing pieces? are they all in the most wanted modules repo?

[05:11] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Red also has a long way to go.

[05:11] <Xliff> But hey, Raku isn't even 5, yet.

[05:11] <Xliff> I think we're doing quite well.

[05:12] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: I'm not sure. I think if someone started using Red seriously it'll get ready very quickly

[05:12] <AlexDaniel> so IMO it's ready to be used by somebody :)

[05:13] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Still doesn't cover much of the use cases I'd absolutely need it to cover before I'd use it.

[05:13] <Xliff> But it's getting there.

[05:13] <Xliff> He's working on joins, though. That's a big step.

[05:14] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: I'm not sure, actually. We have Cro, we have Red, someone just needs to actually make a web framework

[05:15] <Kaiepi> Net::Telnet's probably the closest thing i have to a module that could sway people to use raku since my goal is to make it even better than any existing telnet library

[05:16] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Um. I thought we had a Web framework. I know Cro could be used to build one, but wasn't there another one?

[05:16] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: no

[05:17] <Xliff> Bailador?

[05:17] <AlexDaniel> it's dead

[05:17] <Xliff> What? When?

[05:19] <AlexDaniel> honestly I don't remember it ever not being dead…

[05:19] <Xliff> Hrm. Better to pick that up than re-invent the wheel?

[05:20] *** rindolf joined
[05:20] <Xliff> Honestly, I'd need to see a spec for a decent web framework and try my hand at it.

[05:22] <AlexDaniel> maybe I'm wrong about Bailador

[05:22] <AlexDaniel> thing is, I tried it in 2017 or maybe earlier

[05:22] <AlexDaniel> it did the job, a little bit, but otherwise was dead :)

[05:23] <AlexDaniel> but now I look at the commit history and there was a lot of stuff going on in 2017-2018

[05:24] <AlexDaniel> as for reworking Bailador instead of starting from scratch, I don't think it makes sense

[05:24] <AlexDaniel> but please feel free to :)

[05:24] <AlexDaniel> nowadays you'd probably start with cro and red

[05:25] <mister_flash> Mojolicious is actually good, someone could port it on Raku and add some things

[10:48] <ufobat> is Array.clone() supposed to clone multi dimensional arrays deeply? It seems it isn't. But I would assume it should, since you can do a @array[1;2;3] aka It does not feel like it is an Array of Arrays

[11:36] <Kaiepi> the docs say it only applies to the container and not the value itself, but shouldn't $!foo = $foo throw if that's the case?

[11:53] <Kaiepi> oh, it doesn't look like this trait is fully implemented for attributes

[11:53] <Kaiepi> it sets its $!ro attribute when it gets applied, but nothing uses this, not even its own readonly method

[16:45] <chloekek> Also qq｢｣ for interpolation.

[16:51] <chloekek> Currently programming in Perl 5 though.

[16:51] <chloekek> No such goodies :(

[16:54] <lizmat> m: my $perl = "🐪"; $perl++; say $perl   # so glad we didn't turn that into a butterfly

[16:57] <chloekek> Not quite base 2 it seems.

[17:00] *** sena_kun left
[17:04] <lizmat> it is if you consider "🐪" and "🐫" one ?

[17:05] <lizmat> m: my $perl = "🐪"; say :2(($perl++).trans("🐫🐪" => "10")) for ^10

[17:06] <chloekek> It never flips the initial digit.

[17:07] <kurahaupo> looks like counting in binary with 🐫 == 1, 🐪 == 0 ?

[17:07] <lizmat> it does from 0 to 1

[17:07] <lizmat> and in all other cases, the first is the most significant, so always a 1

[17:08] <chloekek> p6: my $perl = „🐫“; for 1 .. 10 { ($perl++).flip.say }

[19:06] <jmerelo> In ~ 4 hours, a fresh new entry by tmtvl

[19:10] <El_Che> jmerelo++

[19:10] <El_Che> tbrowder++

[19:12] <tbrowder> El_Che: thnx!

[19:17] *** sena_kun joined
[19:18] <jmerelo> tbrowder: it's getting a few visits, the problem is the old calendar is getting even more right now...

[19:18] <jmerelo> So we really need to generate some buzz about it: spread it over email groups, social media, and all over...

[19:20] <moritz> I'll post a quick note on the old one that there is a new site

[19:21] <jmerelo> great, moritz. Thanks.

[19:22] <jmerelo> Please also accept the invitation for the new site, and connect it when you do with raku_news, please.

[19:24] <patrickb> jmerelo: Is there a reason we don't try to get a stackoverflow alias perl6 -> raku up? I seem to recall you were on this some time i the past, not sure though...

[19:24] <jmerelo> patrickb: I requested write permission to do it by hand, and got burned, first

[19:25] <jmerelo> patrickb: second, we can create an alias, but there's some numbers involved, I think there must be a balance between old and new name, somethign like 30% difference

[19:25] <jmerelo> patrickb: and then we need 10k karma, but after the last recomputation of karma, I can do it.

[19:26] <jmerelo> patrickb: let me see if I can do it now, but I think I will not be able

[19:27] <jmerelo> now I remember

[19:28] <jmerelo> We can't create a synonym for perl6 because it's a "version specific synonim"

[19:28] <jmerelo> I guess it's like creating a "debian7" synonyn for whatever, like "sid"

[19:28] <jmerelo> Let me try in the other direction

[19:29] <moritz> jmerelo: do you know where I can do the twitter thing you mentioned?

[19:29] <jmerelo> patrickb: no, I can't: "Can't create synonym; the 'perl6' tag appears more than 1.25 times the 'raku' tag"

[19:29] <patrickb> jmerelo: Ugh... that sounds like it shouldn't apply to our case. The 6 in Perl6 is no version number. Should I try to bug some SO staff about it?

[19:29] <jmerelo> So we need to delete many perl6 tags, and add many raku tags

[19:30] <jmerelo> patrickb: that's apparently the only way to do it.

[19:30] <Grinnz> you should be able to get a moderator to do it

[19:31] <moritz> ah, https://rakuadventcalendar.wordpress.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=sharing

[19:31] <moritz> done

[19:31] <jmerelo> moritz: great. Thanks!

[19:34] <patrickb> I think a meta.stackoverflow.com question is the way to go. I'll create a question.

[19:35] <jmerelo> patrickb: good luck

[19:35] <jmerelo> patrickb: and thanks.

[19:36] <patrickb> There already is a respective question: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/391733/make-perl6-a-synonym-for-raku

[19:36] <patrickb> Please up vote!

[19:39] <El_Che> favorited and upvoted

[19:40] <jmerelo> patrickb: the thing is, "synonyms" does not quite reflect what StackOverflow does. It's not symmetrical, for instance.

[19:41] <jmerelo> If we suggest perl6 as a synonym for raku, every time someone tags something with raku, the system will tell them if they are sure about that.

[19:41] <jmerelo> What we want is raku as a synonym for perl6. Which we can't do due to their "no synonyms for versions" policy.

[19:42] <patrickb> jmerelo: I think it's the other way round.

[19:42] <jmerelo> patrickb: hm

[19:42] <El_Che> If someone has time, please try the tar.gz relocable install of rakudo. It's a new feature and I think it's a killer one. So please test it: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2019.11

[19:42] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/download/v2019.11/rakudo-pkg-2019.11-01-linux-64bit.tar.gz

[19:43] <El_Che> (there is also a 32-bit version if someone is running 32-bit linux: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/download/v2019.11/rakudo-pkg-2019.11-01-linux-32bit-nojit.tar.gz

[19:43] <patrickb> El_Che: You are doing relocatable builds? - Great! I was just about starting to do those my self. (literally now)

[19:43] <Grinnz> jmerelo: a moderator can make it the correct direction regardless, afaik

[19:44] <jmerelo> patrickb: here's the list of synonyms and "targets" https://stackoverflow.com/tags/synonyms

[19:44] <El_Che> patrickb: yes, I started from your notes!

[19:45] <jmerelo> patrickb: so what we want is a target raku for the synonym perl6... So right, we need to create perl6 as a synonym for raku.

[19:45] <jmerelo> In that case, what we need is 1. Delete perl6 tags, add raku tags 2. Suggest perl6 as a synonym 3. Vote. Moderator might be faster, but it's still doable.

[19:46] <jmerelo> So go back to your old questions and retag them, and if you've got the privs, do that to other questions too.

[19:46] <patrickb> jmerelo: I thinkg the meta question I linked above is the way to go. We just need a moderator to have a look at it. It already has the 'support' tag added to it, so I guess upvoting and waiting is all we can do.

[19:46] <patrickb> jmerelo: Just as you say. :-)

[19:46] <jmerelo> patrickb: not all... we can still re-tag questions and then we won't need moderators.

[19:47] <patrickb> El_Che: I am rebuilding the rakudo.org website to also offer such precompiled packages as download. Would you be willing to to the builds for that?

[19:48] <El_Che> how many point do we need to be allowed to remove tags?

[19:48] <El_Che> patrickb: sure, they are already automated on travis

[19:48] <patrickb> Woot!

[19:50] <patrickb> WRT naming of the files: What I currently have in my rakudo.org changes is rakudo-[version]-[platform]-[architecture].[zip|tar.gz] where platform is [win|macos|linux] and architecture is [x86|x86_64].

[19:51] *** rindolf left
[19:51] <patrickb> I'd try not to do "32bit" or similar, as that could equally well be arm64 vs arm32 or so. Better be literal about the architecture.

[19:53] <patrickb> El_Che: Do you think it's worth it to have the "-nojit" stuff in the name? I'm leaning to the side of "not worth it".

[19:53] <El_Che> from a coherence point of view: no

[19:54] <El_Che> from a pragmatic yes: it's a warning as "don't be discouraged if it's slow, we know"

[19:54] <El_Che> patrickb: the name of the file can change if needed

[19:55] <El_Che> (I am in the processing of moving the create-pkgs-with-docker part to a different repo (now private) and use that in rakudo-pkg)

[19:55] <El_Che> *process

[19:56] <patrickb> El_Che: You have a point. Can we decide on a defined format? (The website relies solely on the name to determine what's in it). What about rakudo-[version]-[platform]-[architecture]-[comment].[zip|tar.gz] Where the -[comment] part is optional?

[19:56] <El_Che> works for me

[19:56] <El_Che> we can do even do without the comment

[19:57] <El_Che> and point it out in the download page

[19:57] <El_Che> I have worked somewhat on the windows variant, but it has been painful

[19:58] <El_Che> relocatable --> split out pkg creation -> windows -> macox

[19:58] <El_Che> 1 is done, 2 is written but need finetuning

[19:58] <patrickb> El_Che: You even fixed up the raku and raku-debug sym links. :-)

[19:58] <El_Che> 3: the situation in windows is bad, so it needs to be done

[19:58] *** jmerelo left
[19:59] <El_Che> 4: homebrew has regular rakudo next to rakudo-star, so for homebrew users it's ok for now

[19:59] <El_Che> patrickb: yeah, my travis builds keep failing :)

[19:59] <El_Che> kept

[20:00] <patrickb> El_Che: Did the windows instructions in release-guide-binary.md work when done manually?

[20:01] <El_Che> well, no because I was doing them on travis

[20:02] <El_Che> the idea was that the builds happen there

[20:02] <El_Che> but it's a painful process

[20:02] <El_Che> I used your notes, though

[20:03] <El_Che> but things that are easy on linux/mac are *hard* on windows

[20:03] <El_Che> finding the right make/nmake

[20:03] <El_Che> from all the soft installed

[20:03] <patrickb> I tried doing it in a windows docker container (Microsoft offers those!). But failed because the small containers miss a lot of plumbing...

[20:03] <El_Che> running find / -name "*make.exe" on travis runs to find it :)

[20:04] <El_Che> do those work on travis or other free-for-foss providers?

[20:05] <El_Che> patrickb: This is as far as I got: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/windows/.travis.yml#L7

[20:05] <patrickb> El_Che: It requires "Docker for Windows" which requires putting Windows itself in a special mode. In that mode most other virtualization technology doesn't work. So I doubt it it will work on travis.

[20:05] <El_Che> patrickb: there is a problem with the right perl to use

[20:05] <El_Che> patrickb: modules mixed and so on

[20:05] <El_Che> patrickb: so I need to get some paths right

[20:06] <El_Che> patrickb: hyperv?

[20:06] <patrickb> hyperv rings a bell. That might be it

[20:06] <El_Che> that's a no-no then

[20:07] <El_Che> travis (beta) and appveyor offer windows support

[20:07] <El_Che> I am kind of invested on travis so that's my target nr 1, but others are possible

[20:07] <El_Che> since I discovered the parallel builds I am happy :)

[20:08] <patrickb> I'm all for doing what works.

[20:09] <El_Che> rakudo-pkg does 24 builds for every commit

[20:09] <El_Che> so serial building is not an option = after 50min you have an automatic fail

[20:11] <patrickb> El_Che: The rakudo builds you linked work on my machine. You saved me the trouble of doing these builds myself (I need them for some work on rakudobrew I'm doing)

[20:12] <El_Che> patrickb++

[20:12] <El_Che> about the format: rakudo-[version]-[platform]-[architecture].[zip|tar.gz]

[20:12] <El_Che> there is also a revision needed

[20:13] <El_Che> if we change something besides the release; new version of zef, e.g.

[20:13] <patrickb> What's a revision?

[20:13] <patrickb> hm

[20:13] <El_Che> like packages do:

[20:13] <patrickb> like a packaging point release?

[20:13] <El_Che> yes

[20:14] <El_Che> in this case, zef is included

[20:14] <El_Che> what if we need to bump zef but rakudo stays on the same version

[20:14] <El_Che> e.g. a bug or change in the ecosystem

[20:15] <patrickb> So that's what the -01 in your filenames was about.

[20:15] <patrickb> Makes sense.

[20:15] <El_Che> rakudo-2019.11-01-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

[20:15] <El_Che> is that ok?

[20:16] <patrickb> I somehow mourn about small and tidy filenames, but I guess the world is just more complex than I'd like.

[20:16] <patrickb> El_Che: Looks good to me.

[20:16] <El_Che> it's a tar

[20:16] <El_Che> it's unpacked to rakudo-2019.11

[20:16] <El_Che> not the hole name :)

[20:17] <patrickb> I've already given it a try. :-)

[20:18] <patrickb> Do we expect to have more than 9 packaging point releases?

[20:18] *** ufobat_ joined
[20:18] <patrickb> If no, why the 0?

[20:18] <El_Che> you never know

[20:19] <patrickb> We don't do it for normal point releases either.

[20:19] <El_Che> it looks like a revision nr

[20:19] <El_Che> 01 

[20:19] <El_Che> instead of a regular numer

[20:19] <patrickb> I don't have a strong opinion on this one.

[20:20] <patrickb> Let's keep -01 for now. No need for bikeshedding.

[20:21] <El_Che> changed to the new names: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/windows/.travis.yml#L7

[20:21] <El_Che> oops

[20:21] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/v2019.11

[20:22] *** ufobat left
[20:23] <El_Che> bintray adapted

[20:28] <El_Che> patrickb: adapted the build script for the new name, so we don't forget for the next release :)

[20:28] <patrickb> Great!

[21:30] <tellable6> 2019-12-01T13:42:33Z #raku-dev <jnthn> Xliff You'd need to arrange for that to be overridden in the ClassHOW

[21:31] <Xliff> m: (43, 82, 0)».so».Int.say

[21:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar f608a7a41: OUTPUT: «(1 1 0)␤»

[21:32] <Xliff> jnthn: How would I do that?!

[21:37] <Xliff> .tell jnthn Alright, how do I make incorporate_multi_candidates overridable in the ClassHOW?

[21:37] <tellable6> Xliff, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[21:57] <guifa> Is there a way to export an enum in or outside of a package based on an input flag?

[21:58] <guifa> I have two sets of enums that have overlapping values, but that might want to be used together occasionally

[21:58] <guifa> err overlapping keys

[21:58] <guifa> I can stick them in a dummy namespace, but then the namespace has to be used

[22:01] <Xliff> Hrm...

[22:01] <Xliff> Eliminate the overlapping keys from the enums and then use it as a conditional constant you define in a BEGIN block?

[22:01] <Xliff> guifa ^^

[22:02] <guifa> hmmm

[22:02] <Xliff> I can't think of a more elegant way to do it, unfortunately... :/

[22:02] <guifa> Yeah, I might just leave them fully namespaced for now and if I can find an elegant way later I will

[22:03] <guifa> some of the enums have several hundred values lol

[22:04] <guifa> (I’m rearranging LanguageTag to make the Language/Region/Variant/etc classes inner to the LanguageTag, so I can then have a lot more freedom to play around with the top level Language:: namespace for language codes

[22:05] <Xliff> Ah, OK.

[22:05] <Xliff> Good luck!

[22:06] <guifa> And I still need to finish my advent day post =\

[23:46] <cognomin_> hi, what is the current state of raku js ?

[23:50] <AlexDaniel> cognomin_: it sorta works https://perl6.github.io/6pad/

[23:55] <cognomin_> The compiler is js or just the backend ?

[23:59] <cognomin_> Learning sveltejs. Wish there was a raku svelte
