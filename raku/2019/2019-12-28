[07:57] <xinming_> How do we pass  an array to    multi MAIN?

[07:58] <xinming_> For example,    multi test ('x', @array) { ... };     I try something like `raku t.p6 x a b c`,  It will only display the command line

[08:14] *** sena_kun left
[08:28] *** sena_kun joined
[08:33] <CIAvash> xinming_: You probably want `*@array`

[08:37] <xinming_> CIAvash: I don't mean that. :-)

[08:37] <xinming_> I do mean  @array.   As when we use  :@array,  We can do  --array 1 --array 2  to pass array. So, I wonder how we do positional arg

[08:41] <CIAvash> your example suggested that. so what happens to a value after the array? example: ('x', @array, 'y'). Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think MAIN has a case for that.

[08:54] <xinming_> CIAvash: If so, I think we should raise error in this case.

[08:54] <xinming_> multi test ('xx', @array) { }    raise error to mean  @array is not supported

[08:55] <xinming_> in raku multi,    test('x', @array, 'y')     etst('x', $other-object, 'y')    will work as expected

[09:07] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: https://termbin.com/qrey    <--- I think you mis-understood me, What I mean multi-column constraint is something like this.

[13:04] <Tirifto> Hello! Is my understanding correct that prefixing a variable's name with a colon in subroutine invocation passes a pair to the subroutine, whose key is the variable's name and whose value is the variable's value? (Thus requiring a variable to exist in the current scope with a name identical to the key expected by the subroutine which takes named arguments?)

[13:19] <sena_kun> Tirifto: yes, you are correct.

[13:23] <Tirifto> sena_kun: Thanks!

[13:33] <xinming_> m: my %h = ("a" .. "z"); %h.perl.say; for %h<>:p.sort(*.key) -> ($k, $v) { [$k, $v].perl.say; }

[13:33] <xinming_> In this case, How do we unpack the pair produced with .sort method?

[13:37] <xinming_> as far as I tried,

[13:37] <xinming_> This worked, But I still wish to know wether it's possible to do something like    -> ($key, $value) directly.

[13:39] <xinming_> Fianlly got it. :-)

[18:27] <lizmat> Poohman: because $!b is the real name of the attribute

[18:27] <lizmat> "has $.b" signals that an accessor should be made for the attribute

[18:28] <lizmat> using $.b in code, is just syntactic sugar for "self.b", with the advantage that it interpolates

[18:28] *** sena_kun joined
[18:30] <Poohman> thanks lizmat - what do you mean by interpolates?

[18:30] <lizmat> say "the value of b is $.b"

[18:31] <lizmat> say "the value of b is {self.b}"

[18:33] <Poohman> ok

[18:37] <sarna> hey, I want to be able to take any digits from a number, what would be the optimal way of doing this? in a static language I'd turn that int into a string and then into a char array, and then index into it

[20:30] <lizmat> self inside method "b" is a type object.

[20:30] <lizmat> it's *not* an instantiated object

[20:30] *** sena_kun joined
[20:30] <Poohman> ok

[20:30] <lizmat> and a type object does not have any attributes

[20:30] <lizmat> which is what the error message is trying to tell you  :-)

[20:31] <lizmat> my A $temp; $temp.b will *not* automagically make $temp an instantiated object

[20:31] <lizmat> you *can* do that, if that's what you want

[20:32] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a; method b(\SELF:U:) { SELF = self.new(a => "test") } }; my A $foo; $foo.b; dd $foo

[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Preceding context expects a term, but found infix = instead.␤Did you make a mistake in Pod syntax?␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3A { has $.a; method b(\SELF:U:) { SELF =7⏏5 self.new(a => "test") } }; m…»

[20:33] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a; method b(\SELF:) { SELF = self.new(a => "test") } }; my A $foo; $foo.b; dd $foo

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «A $foo = A.new(a => "test")␤»

[20:34] <lizmat> \SELF: means assigning the name SELF to the un-decontainerized invocant, which you can assign to

[20:35] <lizmat> perhaps better readable:

[20:35] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a; method b($invocant is rw:) { $invocant = self.new(a => "test") } }; my A $foo; $foo.b; dd $foo

[20:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «A $foo = A.new(a => "test")␤»

[20:37] <Poohman>  m: class A { has $.a; method b($invocant is rw:) { $invocant = self.new(a => "test") } }; my A $foo; $foo.b; dd $foo; say $foo.a;

[20:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 672c5d403: OUTPUT: «A $foo = A.new(a => "test")␤test␤»

[20:41] *** RobRaku left
[20:42] <Poohman> was reading up on $invocant

[20:42] <Poohman> cool

[20:42] <Poohman> lizmat: thanks
