[00:06] <discord6> <Aearnus> huh, interesting

[00:07] <discord6> <Aearnus> how many reads/writes a second does that come out to vrurg?

[00:09] <vrurg> Try it yourself: https://gist.github.com/vrurg/aa7eb27dd56b6faa898062fe4a0ec5fa

[00:10] <vrurg> On your system it would most likely be different numbers.

[00:40] <Doc_Holliwood> did anybody ever try to upload a module with a wide unicode name? like "Mojūru"

[00:40] <Doc_Holliwood> or even real kanji characters? which this client doesn't support

[00:41] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: there's this https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Acme::%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0:cpan:ELIZABETH

[00:42] * guifa chuckles at that module

[00:43] <Grinnz> based on https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Acme-LookOfDisapproval/anotherlib/Acme/o_o.pm, but probably has to jump through far less hoops :P

[00:43] <AlexDaniel> guifa: you might also like module ../Foo

[00:43] * Doc_Holliwood joins the chuckling

[00:44] <AlexDaniel> guifa: here on the bottom: https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=foo

[00:44] <Grinnz> well that seems like a terrible idea :P

[00:45] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: IIRC you can actually install it if you clone it from here https://github.com/AlexDaniel/foo-dotdotslash

[00:45] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: and then do `zef install .`

[00:45] <guifa> I think I’m going to have to have to join in the fun sometime.  Maybe a Raku and/or Perl calendar variant whose epoch is the original release date? 

[00:45] * guifa would then make the Perl calendar always one day behind the Raku one 😈

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> guifa: actually, I'd love to see an implementation of International Fixed Calendar

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> could be handy for certain operations

[00:46] <Doc_Holliwood> are you nuts?

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: also I think it's possible to uninstall it too

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: oh, and it has tests, and they pass!

[00:47] <Grinnz> heh

[00:47] <Doc_Holliwood> it is known that only opening a source file with date related code has led to sudden brain bleeding and strokes

[00:47] <Doc_Holliwood> let alone reading it

[00:47] <Grinnz> i guess having the ability to store the modules without the same name on the filesystem helps

[00:47] <Grinnz> not so much with the URLs, apparently

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: that's just a bug on the website

[00:48] <guifa> Doc_Holliwood: someone has to do it.  I’m sacrificing myself.  I actually grabbed a copy of the Calendric Calculations book to start work on it

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> I wouldn't be surprised if module <b> does exactly what I expect it to do…

[00:48] * Grinnz is quite happy with the restriction of only word characters and :: in package names

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> yeah, well… I should really upload a <b> module

[00:49] <Grinnz> if that breaks it that's definitely a bug

[00:49] <Grinnz> url escaping can be ambiguous, html escaping not so much :P

[00:50] *** afasdf joined
[00:50] <AlexDaniel> wait there's an emptystring module too?

[00:50] <guifa> The trick is that some calendars can’t be converted with 100% accuracy and then you run into issues of date vs datetime.  I’m actually not sure how to handle a datetime for Hebrew and I’ve not seen any generally advice on handling it

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> oh! There it is

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=author%3A%22Aleks-Daniel+Jakimenko-Aleksejev%22

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> on the bottom

[00:51] <Grinnz> also a nice link :P

[00:51] <Grinnz> that reminds me of when i didnt check for empty strings on https://cpanmeta.grinnz.com/ but didnt notice because they were all just empty <a> anyway

[00:52] <Grinnz> guifa: https://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html

[00:53] <guifa> Grinnz: that page identifies the problem (without stating it as such) but without a solution.   Hebrew calendar days start basically at sunset

[00:53] <Grinnz> mmmhm

[00:54] <Grinnz> sunset data is not encoded to anything useful, so i think you might be generally out of luck there

[00:55] <guifa> You can calculate it, but it’s not really useful anyways, because what do you do for polar areas?

[00:55] <Grinnz> perhaps approximations like sunset is at 6pm would be good enough

[00:55] <AlexDaniel> OK I have a module…

[00:59] <guifa> Grinnz: yeah, there’s no great solution except to give people options (align with Jerusalem, strictly 6pm, align to a supplied location, align to the near non-polar area, etc)

[01:00] <guifa> Islamic calendar has similar problems, it’s impossible to predict observational calendars in advance, so calculations will always have a margin of error of a day or two

[01:01] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: “Foo” doesn't sound like a good one, right?

[01:02] <Grinnz> everything like this is Acme:: in perl 5

[01:02] <Grinnz> unless its a funny pragma that has to be at top level

[11:49] <sena_kun> Doc_Holliwood, how does your `resources` field in META6.json look like? where is your file placed, in `resources/$filename`? in the module distribution directory?

[11:50] <Doc_Holliwood> Mmh. I could find my file in rakudo\share\perl6\site\resources

[11:50] <Doc_Holliwood> but how do I know the checksum?

[11:50] <sena_kun> Doc_Holliwood, you don't need to know those details, you are using external API only

[11:51] <sena_kun> Doc_Holliwood, you can check if your setup fits to some working example

[11:51] <sena_kun> e.g. with cro-http:

[11:51] <sena_kun> https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/META6.json#L74 <- META6.json

[11:51] <sena_kun> https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/resources/index.html <- the file placement itself

[11:51] <sena_kun> https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/b9d03aa8b608aa126ea9edda7939c9990973e7b2/lib/Cro/HTTP/Router.pm6#L1068 <- usage

[11:55] <sena_kun> Doc_Holliwood, makes sense or not really?

[11:55] <Doc_Holliwood> finrah i seee

[11:55] <Doc_Holliwood> ah, i see

[11:55] <Doc_Holliwood> see i dumped %?RESOURCES and saw no keys

[11:56] <Doc_Holliwood> but when I ask for %?RESOURCES{"myfile"} it return something

[11:56] <sena_kun> well, that's because there is some magic involved, so you don't don't inspect it directly, rather you ask it "Give me something by this name".

[11:56] <sena_kun> s/don't don't/don't/

[11:57] <Doc_Holliwood> That could be mentioned in the documentation. 

[11:58] <sena_kun> https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2240 <- there is even my ticket that asks for that...

[12:02] <sena_kun> I can, of course, and I did not insist, just asked.

[14:07] <nine> Oh boy...just found out where that bug in our Perl 5 code base at work is coming from that went away when I added some debug output.

[14:08] <nine> The debug statement was: warn((scalar keys %$links) . " entries in cache");

[14:08] <nine> Followed by while (my ($name, $target) = each %$links) { ... } So the bug was that the hash iterator for %$links wasn't reset between calls to that function. This makes me appreciate the cleanup that Raku as a language got all the more!

[16:01] <AlexDaniel> ⚠ please think twice before doing disruptive changes on wikipedia and other related projects: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/120#issuecomment-543810775

[16:08] <El_Che> Is it likely we hava release tomorrow or it more a generic timer what releasable shows? (I am preparing the addition of Centos 8 and Ubuntu 19.10 packages)

[16:08] *** jjmerelo left
[16:11] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: eh there are a few issues right now

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: so it will likely take a bit more than that

[16:12] <El_Che> ok, good to know. I may relase 2019.07 packages for these new distros in the meantime

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> I'm optimistic, I don't think it'll take too long, just not 1 day I guess

[16:13] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: are you the release manager again?

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: still is, unfortunately

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> kawaii is running Blin, so that's some help

[16:14] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: btw, it'd be even better if you were creating tickets for detected regressions :)

[16:14] <El_Che> That should teach you not to do a great job in your future endehavours :)

[16:14] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: isn't it time to start thinking about release branching and cherry-picking only blocker fixes?

[16:15] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yeah, it's a common complaint, but it's not as simple

[16:16] <AlexDaniel> sure I can start a release branch like twoo weeks ahead or whatever, but then people would be sad that the commits are not making their way into the next release and start cherry-picking a bunch of stuff

[16:16] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: we make a policy on this. It's normal for a release to lag behind, I don't see a big deal here.

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> it's already hard to keep master branch sane with all the bumps and stuff, and doing the same for release branches is doable but not as great as people suggest

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> and then, whateverable doesn't even track branches, so all the tooling will suck

[16:18] <AlexDaniel> as I mentioned previously, I'll likely submit a grant proposal that'll have this covered, so maybe it'll be easier in the future

[16:18] <AlexDaniel> (I mean, making whateverable better)

[16:18] <El_Che> AlexDaniel++

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I also don't, but in my experience whenever we had release branches for just a few days people would keep asking if their amazing fixes will make their way into the release

[16:19] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: tooling is the only serious problem as to me. It is technical. The rest we can manage.

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I guess it's less of an issue now because rakudo is very stable and pretty fast too

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> so yeah, that's definitely something we can improve

[16:20] <vrurg> With a good release policy in place the answer to those requests would be: see paragraph 'WHY NO'

[16:21] <AlexDaniel> there's this thing also… every new release manager used to introduce a bunch of good changes to the release process

[16:21] <vrurg> Ok, I have things to be done first place... Won't be able to answer but would try to follow.

[16:22] <AlexDaniel> and if you look at this list you'll probably see an issue :) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod#releases-so-far

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> and people who haven't contributed much to raku or rakudo are even more welcome to this job

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> because I'd much rather not distract existing devs with release management

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: you had something you were working on, any news? https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/54#issuecomment-507668134

[16:55] <kawaii> Sorry yes, I've been extremely distracted recently due to $real-life but I do have some long-term plans for how the "release team" should structure and organize releases in the future. I need to find some time to find my feet in the community again, as I took a backseat during the name transition to see what would happen, and contemplated my position here as I'm one of the few people who chose Perl 6 _because_ it's Perl.

[16:55] <kawaii> As opposed to people who see the name "Perl" and are dissuaded from reading further into it.

[17:02] <sena_kun> While people can feel, the language itself won't change whatever name it is under. The features are here, the ideas behind are here.

[17:06] <sena_kun> imho, names (in general) are just links, just as words are in general. once people made an agreement that, hmm, an abstract class of objects with some common traits is called "a chair", and some other imaginary class to be "a table". We, humans, use our cool telepathy powers to recognize that "Oh, so when my ears perceive those waves in the air, I should parse them and get an imaginary brain concept linked to this pattern of air waves, 

[17:06] <sena_kun> ok, I'll do that". But virtually there is no difference, as world does not need words to operate at all.

[17:07] <sena_kun> alas, the world is complex and our brains are simpler than it by definition, so our way of doing telepathy is often very LTA.

[17:10] <sena_kun> I did not intend to say something like "Your feelings are not important!" right now, only to provide a (possibly) different perspective.

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> guifa: it depends, I think “.pm6” files can have any extension, but I'm not sure

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> guifa: as long as the path to them is right in META6.json

[19:29] <tbrowder> i'm asking those who used "stacked" leading declarator blocks, a sequence of lines before a sub like"("#| some comment

[19:30] <tbrowder> like: #| comment 1; #| comment 2;... how you would like that to be rendered

[19:31] <guifa> tbrowder: I asked that actually just yesterday or maybe it was day before.  timotimo said that the presumption is two oneliners like that should be joined

[19:31] <tbrowder> at the moment the sequence is concatenated into one normalized string

[19:31] <guifa> #| Hello, my

[19:31] <guifa> #| name is 

[19:31] <guifa> #| Camelia

[19:32] <guifa> sub foo …

[19:32] <squashable6> 🍕 niner++ closed issue “Regression in NativeCall, seems Role related”: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3235

[19:32] <tbrowder> but i woulld like to see my text as is, newlines and spaces as i entered them

[19:34] <tbrowder> at the moment, you can use the #|( .... ) form to do the same thing, one string

[19:34] <guifa> Based on some other systems I’ve seen, I think the optimal would be to assume that if the line starts on the same indent level, consider it a continuation of the previous.  If it has a higher space indent, then new line + indent X spaces

[19:35] <guifa> Because thinking about how I’ve done those style comments in my code, I definitely have some indented stuff that should be preserved.

[19:35] <tbrowder> my proposal is to modify the "stack" of #| lines to keep the text as is, not stringify it into one line

[19:37] <tbrowder> guifa: the problem with the fancier method you're suggesting is grammar complexity. we already have good pod elements to do that kind of thing.

[19:39] <tbrowder> i have been able to implement my proposal but don't want to waste any more time if the idea is shot down

[19:45] <guifa> tbrowder: i’m not opposed to yours.  I don’t think either one is inherintely better or worse, I’d just be curious to see how most people use them and would interpret the typical uses (that’s an real curiousity, in case textchat isn’t conveying it well).

[19:45] <guifa> Or, thinking outloud, perhaps since the #|( … ) “will not translate to a multi-line display”, we could say that a sequence of #| over various lines by default implies newlines, but have ¬ or something force join it, and allow \n or a double newline imply a newline for the #|( … ) syntax ?

[19:46] *** wildtrees joined
[19:48] <tbrowder> guifa: we're on the same page, but in any case, at present, the single line is all you can get. my simple proposal gives you a choice and provides a path to future improvements.

[19:59] <tbrowder> by the way, as the code is now, a #|newline is just an ordinary comment that is NOT added to previous or later #| leading declarator comment lines

[20:00] <guifa> ^^ so since it’s not combining them, this is a great time to decide on how to interpret it :-)

[20:01] *** xkr47 joined

[20:04] <xkr47> thanks!

[20:11] <xkr47> anyone tried using the graal vm with raku?

[21:09] <Doc_Holliwood> rich syntax has it's drawbacks. took me a while to figure this out: $app.all-files>.Array>.Str , which should have been $app.all-files.Array>>.Str of course

[21:10] <Doc_Holliwood> and then you sit there and wonder why your value 3 levels down the stack is True instead of something to iterate on =)

[21:10] <simcop2387> this place is slowly filling up, congrats on the new name and all.

[21:19] <simcop2387> i'm going to upgrade the install of raku on perlbot (and also probably setup a rakubot) this weekend, i think I ask this every time, but are there any particular libraries or modules that you folks would like added (or removed) when I do so?  only real restriction is that the pastebin and eval can't do network traffic

[21:20] <simcop2387> will also ask that in #perl6 too

[21:20] <xinming_> IIRC, there is a sweet function to generate the random string with template, which is like    given template like  "yyyyyy=xxxxxx"    then, we replace yyyy and xxxx with random string, Do I remember wrong?

[21:21] <xinming_> I now finish it with @list.pick(15) to do the trick

[21:54] <cj> fwiw, https://salsa.debian.org/perl6-team/rakudo.git is what I was looking for

[22:08] <lelf> How do you go from 1...3 to (1, (1,2), (1,2,3)) ?

[23:18] <mla> im interesting in using raku to interface with a static library i use. it's build system generates a .a file and .h headers, is there a way to use NativeCall with static libs? NativeCall seems to be expecting an .so only

[23:23] <Grinnz> complete educated guess, but probably not; FFI::Platypus in perl5 requires the dynamic lib, while building XS works with either (static preferred)

[23:25] <jnthn> mla: I'm pretty sure you'd need to first link it into a .so. It's not so much nativecall itself, as that you can't dlopen (the OS-provided thing nativecall depends on for library loading) the static library.

[23:26] <mla> ah got it thanks, i guess my best bet is to figure out if i can somehow generate a .so

[23:26] <Grinnz> i use the term "educated" lightly; mostly i've just thrown myself at ffi a lot and some things stuck :P

[23:26] <mla> XS sounds interesting too

[23:27] <Grinnz> that's a perl thing, not raku

[23:27] <mla> but perl6 -> inline -> xs -> c seems like a lot

[23:27] <mla> yeah

[23:27] <jnthn> You might also consider https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake

[23:27] <jnthn> Which could well help getting the .a -> .so step integrated into the Raku module install workflow

[23:32] <mla> i see, makes sense via .a to .so via p6librarymake, probably a bit over my head atm being a c intermediate and p6 beginner but will take a try if i can't just generate a so from the source lib

[23:32] <mla> thx for the help
