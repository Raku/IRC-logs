[00:33] <sacomo> elcaro: if version is defined, you can use something like this `use JSON::Class; say JSON::Class.^ver`, otherwise, a simple way with zef "zef locate JSON::Class "

[10:01] <wahnberger> hello, is there a way to add the :batch to a construction like this: race for @rows -> @   { ... }

[10:20] *** AlexDani` is now known as AlexDaniel

[10:20] *** AlexDaniel left
[10:20] *** AlexDaniel joined
[10:21] <AlexDaniel> wahnberger: race for @rows.race(:2batch) -> ‚Ä¶ { ‚Ä¶ }

[10:21] <AlexDaniel> otherwise it won't race at all, if I'm not mistaken

[10:21] <jnthn> No, it's if you forget the `race` before `for` that it won't do it at all

[10:22] <wahnberger> yep..but that seems to much for DBIsh :)

[10:23] <jnthn> Make sure you're not sharing a connection object between threads. That won't end well anywhere.

[10:24] <wahnberger> what i need to read?

[10:25] <jnthn> I'd just use one of the DB::SQLite, DB::Pg, and so on, which do a pool for you.

[10:27] <wahnberger> DB::Pg wont install on windows to i use DBIsh 

[10:28] <wahnberger> *so

[10:40] <wahnberger> @Daniel: race for @rows.race(:2batch) -> ‚Ä¶ { ‚Ä¶ }  so "race" two times?

[10:41] <jnthn> Yes

[10:41] <wahnberger> i would never dig from reading the docs

[10:44] <Altreus> Going from path to the leaf dirname is awkward: $path.IO.dirname.IO.basename

[10:44] <Altreus> Is there a better way?

[16:30] <SmokeMachine> Altreus, lizmat: Yes‚Ä¶ but I was going tou anounce it after the bot red become available‚Ä¶ #red

[16:35] <lizmat> hmmm... don't see it in the channel list yet ?

[16:37] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: it‚Äôs not anywhere yet...

[16:37] <lizmat> ah, ok...  :-)

[16:38] <lizmat> perhaps call it #red-orm instead of #red, you might get a lot of inappropriate visits otherwise

[16:38] <lizmat> there also appears to be a #red-lang  :-)

[16:39] <Altreus> I was going to assume #red-orm so +1 that idea

[16:40] * Altreus politely doesn't create it :P

[16:40] <Altreus> I was going to ask if there's a way to turn on auto-quoting of identifiers

[16:40] <Altreus> I just tried to create a table called transaction...

[16:40] <Altreus> Alternatively, if there's a way of controlling how the table gets named

[16:40] <Altreus> (so the model Transaction creates the table transactions)

[16:48] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: you can use the trait `is table<another_name>` to name yout table...

[16:49] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: for example `model Black is table<not_bla> { ‚Ä¶ }` will use `not_bla` as table name...

[16:51] <Altreus> nice, nice

[16:51] <Altreus> I was poring through the code looking for a clue :)

[16:52] <SmokeMachine> I think I‚Äôll create a new survey‚Ä¶ should Red generate a different name for your table if the database do not accept the name of your model? for example: should `model Transaction {‚Ä¶}` create a table called `_transaction` or something else?

[16:53] <Altreus> dbic has the option to use plural names, which is a style choice but many prefer it

[16:53] <Altreus> Perl5, mind you, has modules to pluralise words...

[16:53] <Altreus> But most DB drivers don't have "illegal" table names, they just have quoting styles

[16:54] <Altreus> in psql, CREATE TABLE "transaction" ... is legal

[16:55] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: I created a new wiki page for answers to questions like mine :) https://github.com/FCO/Red/wiki/Cookbook

[16:55] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: thanks!

[16:56] <Altreus> Every few months I come back to Red and start documenting stuff xD

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: maybe I‚Äôve done it wrong, but I got a list of reserver SQL words and did this: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Driver/CommonSQL.pm6#L33

[16:59] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: can I ask you a favor? would you mind to add that Cookbook here? https://github.com/FCO/Red/tree/master/docs

[19:38] <hythm> can I use Array as a key object for Bag, without stringfying the array?

[19:38] <hythm> m: my @a = (1, 2), (1, 2); say @a.Bag.pairs; #wanted result (1 2) => 2

[19:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: ¬´((1 2) => 1 (1 2) => 1)‚ê§¬ª

[19:45] *** MasterDuke left
[19:51] <vrurg> hythm: Bag operates on objects. Thus, @a[0] and @a[1] are two different arrays.

[19:52] <vrurg> m: my @a = <a b>; my $b = Bag.new(@a, @a); say $b 

[19:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: ¬´Bag([a b](2))‚ê§¬ª

[20:04] <hythm> vrurg, I get your point, but since @a[0] and  @[1], contains the same items, I expected it to work in this case. reading  Elizabeth Mattijsen answer on this SO question, If i understood correctly it means It should work, but still not yet implemented. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47941500/using-a-hash-with-object-keys-in-perl-6 

[20:06] <vrurg> hythm: I just tell you how things are for the moment. :)

[20:06] <vrurg> You asked, what you can do, right? ;)

[20:10] *** chloekek_ joined
[20:13] <hythm> Thanks vrurg :). I was checking if there is other way to do that

[20:14] <vrurg> hythm: I wonder if...

[20:14] <vrurg> Wait a second.

[20:14] <vrurg> m: my @a = (1, 2), (1, 2); say @a.Map.Bag;

[20:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: ¬´Bag(1 2(2))‚ê§¬ª

[20:18] <vrurg> m: my @a = (1, 2), (1, 2); say @a.List.Bag

[20:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: ¬´Bag(1(2), 2(2))‚ê§¬ª

[20:19] <hythm> vrurg: hmm, so why "Map"  makes it work? 

[20:19] <vrurg> m: my @a = (1, 2), (1, 2); say @a.Map.Bag.perl

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 75056dfa1: OUTPUT: ¬´("1 2"=>2).Bag‚ê§¬ª

[20:27] <hythm> vrurg: Thanks vrurg :)

[20:28] <tobs> johnjay: that is not sufficiently identifier-like, but you can define it as a term:
