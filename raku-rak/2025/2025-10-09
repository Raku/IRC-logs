[15:24] <[Coke]> I want to do something like ack's -w.

[15:25] <[Coke]> and because it's not a parameter but part of the search criteria, I cant save it as an alias.

[15:25] <[Coke]> maybe it's already in there somewhere, there are a lot of options!

[15:33] <[Coke]> so 'rak -w word' is my end goal.

[15:33] <[Coke]> but right now I only see how to do that as rak §word

[15:34] <[Coke]> (which I can type on this keyboard but is much slower. :)

[17:43] <lizmat> rak --type=word word

[17:43] <lizmat> rak --type=words word

[18:47] <[Coke]> See, I'm just lazy and not reading the docs.

[18:47] <[Coke]> lizmat++

[18:49] <[Coke]> now I can use my muscle memory for ack -wi, whee

[18:52] <lizmat> :-)
