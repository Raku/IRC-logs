[05:51] <samebchase> Hi, I've noticed that when I pipe the output of rak to some other tool (head, choose etc.), I get an error, but without piping the output there's no error. Will file a proper bug report once I'm at a usable computer.

[05:51] <samebchase> It's been helping me at work. Thanks for making it lizmat! ðŸ’¯

[13:23] <[Coke]> What's the error?

[13:23] <[Coke]> I occasionally get Too many open files

[13:23] <[Coke]> because my shell has bad defaults
