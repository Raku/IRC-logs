[07:47] <wayland> Hi!  I'm looking for something that prints all the lines from STDIN until there's a match, and then it prints another say 5 lines, and then exits.  

[07:48] <wayland> (I'm wanting to find the first "Not OK" test, and a few lines after)

[07:49] <wayland> I've read about the --also-first option, and it doesn't quite seem to do what I want

[08:47] <lizmat> hmmm   that's not possible with rak at the moment, it would require a new context handler

[09:22] <wayland> Currently using: | perl -pe '/not ok/ and $f=1; $f and do { $f++; $f > 6 and exit; }'

[09:22] <wayland> Anyway, thanks for saving me the trouble of looking further :)

[10:25] <lizmat> I guess one could possible want the opposite as well: don't print the lines until there is a match, but then print them all (and possibly N lines before the match)

[11:03] <wayland76> Yes, agreed; but the X lines before/after is already possible, so it's only the "do/don't print until first/last match" part is needed.
