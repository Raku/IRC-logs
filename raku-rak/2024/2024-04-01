[02:56] <SmokeMachine> I'm asking that because I'm playing with the idea of creating a plugin for nvim's telescope for Rak https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GhvhRZiT/CleanShot%202024-04-01%20at%2003.54.41.gif

[11:04] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: PRs welcome: I'm not a user of --vimgrep myself, Damian Conway asked for the feature

[12:41] <SmokeMachine> But is that expected or can be changed?

[12:42] <lizmat> I'm not sure, actually

[12:43] <lizmat> what happens if you disable that check?

[12:44] <lizmat> --vimgrep is an output formatter

[12:44] <lizmat> and only makes sense inside vim, afaik
