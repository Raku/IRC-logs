[15:10] <SmokeMachine> Hi lizmat! Any reason to Edit::Files not be installed when installing App::Rak::Complete?

[15:30] <lizmat> I think it's in the list?

[15:31] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: yup:   "depends": [

[15:31] <lizmat>     "App::Rak:ver<0.2.21+>:auth<zef:lizmat>",

[15:31] <lizmat>     "Edit::Files:ver<0.0.5>:auth<zef:lizmat>",

[15:32] <SmokeMachine> I was trying to use --edit and it said it was missing that... I installed App::Rak::Complete and it was still missing it... when I installed that directly it worked...

[15:33] <SmokeMachine> (I also may have done something wrong...)

[15:33] <lizmat> it's been as a depends since version 0.0.1  :-)

[16:37] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak/main: Revert for now, the needle specification needs a complete overhaul,

[16:37] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak/main: so biting the bullet and abstracting this into a separate module

[16:37] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak/main: that will be using RakuAST
