[14:19] <[Coke]> Hi.

[14:20] <lizmat> hi  :-)

[14:20] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/913c4279578f91a069b575c8f55e4c68 shows an issue where if you specify too many files on the command line, you get an error.

[14:23] <lizmat> what happens if you use --under-version-control instead?

[14:24] <[Coke]> yup, then it's fine - it's not git, it's just the number of command line args.

[14:24] <lizmat> then it's a shell issue

[14:24] <lizmat> hmmm

[14:25] <[Coke]> rak RAKUDO_POD_DECL_BLOCK_USER_FORMAT doc/**/** in zsh reports the two finds I'd expect and then hangs.

[14:26] <lizmat> yeah... I've seen that occasionally, without a proper way of debugging as of yet  :-(

[14:35] <[Coke]> so it can be avoided with ulimit - should rak be more careful and close out open files more aggressively when done, (or queue work until it can be completed)

[15:05] <lizmat> well, I don't know of any platform independent way of finding out the max number of open files ?

[15:23] <[Coke]> I think you'd have to catch the error and try agin

[15:23] <[Coke]> Or catch the error and give a nice error message 

[15:24] <lizmat> could you please make an issue for it, so it doesn't fall through the cracks ?

[16:05] <[Coke]> Done

[16:12] <lizmat> thanks!
