[13:28] <tbrowder> here i am

[13:29] <lizmat> as am I

[13:29] <lizmat> so what are the arguments that you're passing?

[13:31] <tbrowder> i'm trying to use rak in a script. from the start i could not see a way to duplicate  gnu 'find' with rak for inspecting paths and ignoring content.

[13:33] <tbrowder> and my short time using find on mac seemed to be very different from linux

[13:33] <lizmat> could you gist the script ?

[13:34] <tbrowder> yes, give me a few...

[13:40] <tbrowder> ok, the gist:

[13:40] <tbrowder> https://gist.github.com/tbrowder/fb3348a69929d0b7c9f907e83e477ca2#file-rak-raku

[13:44] <tbrowder> i keep playing around with various things, but i would like to emulate gnu find's:   find <dir> -type f|d -name "*ttf" {} \; -print

[13:44] <tbrowder> no obvious content inspection

[13:44] <lizmat> aaah... ok, so I was thinking you were referring to the 'rak' command line interface  :-)

[13:45] <tbrowder> sorry for the cconfusion

[13:46] <lizmat> I'm seeing Cannot resolve caller rak(:quietly, :find, :absolute, :silently(Str), :paths(List), :is-readable, :file(Regex))

[13:46] <lizmat> is that what you're seeing M

[13:46] <lizmat> ?

[13:46] <tbrowder> got to go for a while, see ya later

[13:46] <lizmat> ack, later!

[14:07] <tbrowder> on the file as i showed you, ie:

[14:07] <tbrowder> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/LaLxoC0K/

[14:08] <tbrowder> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/MbOufCyt/

[14:09] <tbrowder> arg, sorry, didn't mean to double post

[14:10] <lizmat> hmmm evidently it needs some sort of Callable as an additional argument

[14:11] <lizmat> I'd have to dive a bit deeper into why it does that:  you're the first "client" of the "rak" module other than myself  

[14:11] <lizmat> this issue is clear to me now...

[14:12] <lizmat> I'll get back to it after I finished the Weekly

[14:12] <lizmat> ok?

[15:08] <tbrowder> you bet, thnx. i don't know how rak's guts work but maybe using a Nil positional could tell rak to skip file content analysis

[15:08] <tbrowder> later...
