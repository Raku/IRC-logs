[14:34] <[Coke]> how to print just matches and not line numbers?

[14:36] <lizmat> --/show-item-number 

[15:47] <[Coke]> should **Stopped showing results after...** be emitted on ERR instead of OUT?

[15:49] <[Coke]> IWBNI if the readme for https://github.com/lizmat/rak had a link near the top for https://github.com/lizmat/App-Rak

[15:52] <[Coke]> Q: why is the default settings name "(default)" and not "default" ?

[15:52] <lizmat> could you make issues for those, I'm afraid they will otherwise fall through the cracks  :-)

[15:57] <[Coke]> Done

[15:58] <lizmat> [Coke]++
