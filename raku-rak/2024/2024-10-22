[14:06] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: Hi! Any Idea what could be happening here? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/cdkDvnEI/image.png

[14:12] <SmokeMachine> sorry... it seems to not be related to rak... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wD3wzEdc/image.png

[14:13] <SmokeMachine> but that's still odd... :(

[14:22] <[Coke]> you may want RAKULIB=. rak --extensions=rakumod  --per-file='{.slurp.AST}'

[14:23] <[Coke]> looks like you're trying to run something in an uninstalled module repo?

[14:23] <[Coke]> but use the code *in* the repo?

[14:24] <[Coke]> (not sure why you have the 'use lib' otherwise)

[14:25] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: Yes, I am. But the files aren't specifies on META6 yet, so I should use `lib`, right? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/PykxiVJb/image.png

[14:25] <[Coke]> what version of raku are you using?

[14:26] <SmokeMachine> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Io75FaTZ/

[14:26] <[Coke]> I would next try to get a raku script to do the .slurp.AST before pulling rak into it.

[14:26] <SmokeMachine> 2024.09

[14:26] <SmokeMachine> I did... and I'm getting the same error... :(

[14:27] <SmokeMachine> [Coke]: ☝️

[14:28] <[Coke]> ok, need to see that file, I gues

[14:31] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/ASTQuery/blob/main/lib/ASTQuery.rakumod

[14:32] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mEpDaJrR/image.png

[14:34] <[Coke]> have you tried with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ?

[14:36] <SmokeMachine> with `raku -c

[14:36] <SmokeMachine> with `raku -c` I did...

[14:36] <SmokeMachine> should I user RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 with .AST method?

[14:38] <SmokeMachine> if I do, it gives an different error: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hSi3irrA/image.png

[14:38] <SmokeMachine> that makes more sense in my mind...

[14:43] <SmokeMachine> it kinda worked... but seems to be "use"ing the module twice: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Yjx2bI2K/image.png

[14:45] <SmokeMachine> but using --repository and --module also don't work... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CWmEDyFS/image.png

[14:45] <[Coke]> ok, now you might be in rak territory. :)

[14:46] <SmokeMachine> :)
