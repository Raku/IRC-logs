[08:17] <Nemokosch> Hi

[08:18] <lizmat> hi!

[08:19] <Nemokosch> I wanted to list all my weekly solutions and did something like this: `rak --accept='* ~~ / 2colours' --files-with-matches`

[08:19] <Nemokosch> the --files-with-matches option seems to be... a bit tricky. I'm not sure it's the right thing to use.

[08:20] <Nemokosch> By tricky, I mean that it skips empty files

[08:20] <Nemokosch> and --files-without-matches would list them

[08:23] <lizmat> files-with(out)-matches will only list the filenames, is that what you want ?

[08:24] <lizmat> could it be that you want:

[08:24] <lizmat> rak '/2colours' --find

[08:24] <lizmat> ??

[08:26] <Nemokosch> Yes, I only wanted the filenames

[08:26] <lizmat> and the filenames that have "/2colours" in them ?

[08:27] <Nemokosch> yes

[08:27] <lizmat> rak '/2colours' --find

[08:31] <Nemokosch> Thanks, huh well, wouldn't have guessed that

[08:32] <Nemokosch> Is --accept and --files-with(out)-matches a valid combination?

[08:32] <Nemokosch> Because I'd still think "everything matches except the empty file" seems buggy

[08:34] <lizmat> well, what are you interested in: the *names* of the files, or the *contents* of the files ?

[08:39] <lizmat> --find turns the list of files (implicitely from the current dir and limited by known extensions by default)

[08:39] <lizmat> into a virtual "file" in which to search in

[09:06] <Nemokosch> the name of the files

[09:06] <Nemokosch> it seems to me the accept version also worked with the path

[09:07] <lizmat> yes, it would work on the selection of the files to work on

[09:07] <Nemokosch> the files didn't contain 2colours, that's for sure, yet the empty file - and only the empty file - turned into a non-match

[09:08] <lizmat> and since you didn't specify a pattern, it would accept anything in a file

[09:08] <lizmat> but if there's nothing in a file, there's nothing to accept, I guess

[09:08] <lizmat> whether that is a bug or a feature, I don't know

[09:09] <Nemokosch> :P
