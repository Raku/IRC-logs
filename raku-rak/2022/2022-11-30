[10:55] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak/main: Avoid issue with NYI on older Rakudos

[11:11] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: Hi!

[11:11] <lizmat> SmokeMachine o/

[11:12] <SmokeMachine> I think not showing filename should imply --/break, because lines from the same file are shown without empty lines between them and from different files they show an empty line...

[11:13] <SmokeMachine> but there is no concept of file there (the file name is not being shown)... so, it seems just some random empty lines...

[11:13] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: ^^

[11:15] <lizmat> well, alternately, you could do --/group-matches

[11:17] <SmokeMachine> with --/grou-matches is still show the "random empty lines"

[11:18] <lizmat> ah... maybe it's the proximate that's doing the empty lines?

[11:18] <lizmat> --/proximate  ?

[11:19] <lizmat> if I make --/break default for --/show-filename

[11:20] <lizmat> then I get test failures  :-(

[11:20] <lizmat> so it would be changing existing behaviour

[11:21] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/G9lyrOEC/image.png

[11:22] <lizmat> and without the --/show-item-number ?

[11:23] <lizmat> ok, so it's not --proximate   :-)

[11:38] <lizmat> looking at a bit of a chicken / egg problem

[11:51] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: will need to think about this some more.... but still leaning on having to be specific wrt --/break

[11:54] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I'm ok with that... I just think it's odd to have "random" empty lines if you don't show the filenames.

[11:55] <lizmat> yeah, I get that...

[11:56] <lizmat> it's just that too many things break in the tests that I'm not sure they shouldn't break :-)

[11:59] <SmokeMachine> :)

[15:05] <[Coke]> just delete the tests! ;)

[15:05] <[Coke]> I am so old I remember not writing tests.

[16:44] * lizmat too... and every time I fall back into old habits, I regret it later

[18:31] <[Coke]> amen, sister.
