[13:46] <Nemokosch> Hello, is there an example of using --paths-from or --files-from with - ?

[13:46] <Nemokosch> I still haven't seen that working

[14:24] <[Coke]> the versioning of rak vs. App::Rak is slightly confusing

[14:26] <[Coke]> just upgraded 'rak' but should have upgraded 'App::Rak', but App::Rak updates the installed 'rak'

[14:29] <[Coke]> I got there, but I could see someone udpating just 'rak' in the wild accidentally and getting confused.

[14:37] <[Coke]> LTA error: 'rak --find --file "*md"' "Could not compile..."

[16:06] <lizmat> I guess I could make App::Rak a dependency on rak, but then it would carry a lot of luggage for someone else wanting to use the "rak" plumbing

[16:07] <Nemokosch> the "could not compile" thing came up a couple of days ago for me as well

[16:10] <lizmat> Nemokosch: checking on the  paths-from issue

[16:37] <lizmat> Nemokosch: 0.2.9 should have that fixed

[16:47] <Nemokosch> thanks, gonna check it at night probably :)
