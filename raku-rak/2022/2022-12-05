[15:12] <Nemokosch> hello, I need to report about a "feature killer"

[15:12] <Nemokosch> regarding --files-from and --show-filename

[15:14] <Nemokosch> if --files-from is set to - (i.e STDIN), --show-filename has no effect, the names of the read (and matched) files is gone for good

[15:15] <Nemokosch> I waited to see if it works from an actual named file and that works as expected

[15:19] <lizmat> please make an issue with the expected and actual output  :-)
