[10:36] <equinox> hi, is there a way i can say "look what extensions you were looking for but *also* look at this extension"

[10:37] <equinox> i sometimes look for IPYNB files for something, but can't help feeling if what i look for could be in some other extension-having files as well :\)

[10:39] <lizmat> --extensions=foo,bar?

[10:39] <lizmat> what is IPYNB ?   maybe we should a group for that ?

[10:39] <equinox> so after that, i run it by default extension setting as well

[10:40] <equinox> IPYNB is for IPython notebooks

[10:40] <equinox> .ipynb is the extension

[10:40] <equinox> goes with Python group

[10:40] <equinox> but the thing is

[10:40] <equinox> i'd like to see *all* possible extensions it used to look, *plus* this one :\)

[10:40] <equinox> little obsessive there

[10:41] <equinox> maybe something like --extensions=*,ipynb?

[10:41] <lizmat> aaah,,,, ok, so --known-extensions  + yours

[10:41] <equinox> indeed

[10:41] <lizmat> I've just added ipynb to the python group (in the next release)

[10:41] <equinox> ty

[10:41] <lizmat> I like the idea of * there

[10:53] <lizmat> equinox: actually, with these changes, the --known-extensions has just become a long way to say --extensions='*'

[10:53] <lizmat> maybe --known-extensions should be dropped as an opton

[10:54] <lizmat> *option

[10:58] <equinox> oh, thanks a lot for the implementation

[10:58] <equinox> i'm a little bit confused for --known-extensions...

[10:59] <equinox> so if i don't specify anything extentions-related, it looks for known extensions only right?

[10:59] <equinox> so to look for every single file, what would you do?

[10:59] <equinox> regardless of extension

[11:00] <equinox> oh, i need to --/known-extensions?

[11:03] <equinox> oh there's `--file`

[11:04] <equinox> confused again: both `--known-extensions` and `--file=True` seem to be default. But latter's documentation says "all files should be included" and the former, well, only known extensions.

[11:09] <lizmat> % rak foo --file --known-extensions

[11:09] <lizmat> Cannot specify --known-extensions with --file.

[11:10] <lizmat> known extensions *used* to be the default...  --is-text is now, if there is no specific filesystem specification

[11:11] <equinox> so nice

[11:12] <equinox> (i did try --file option but hit a stub code, realized using an old version, upgrading... thanks for these)

[11:12] <lizmat> you're welcome... keep those ideas coming  :-)

[11:12] <lizmat> meanwhile I've decided to remove --known-options

[11:12] <lizmat> --known-extensions I mean

[11:16] <equinox> 👍👍

[11:44] <equinox> so i'm getting a compile time error in testing "rak" when installing but it's to do with "zef" i think... not sure

[11:44] <equinox> path-utils' 0.0.13 versus 0.0.11 seems to be causing some issues

[11:44] <equinox> https://hastebin.com/bakubilocu.rb

[11:44] <equinox> Git::Files needs 0.0.11, rak needs 0.0.13

[11:44] <equinox> which is fine i guess

[11:45] <equinox> `path-is-text` is introduced after 0.0.11, and fails "rak" to pass the test

[11:45] <equinox> i guess i can force the tests...

[11:45] <equinox> would you say this is indeed related to "zef" or something else?

[11:46] <lizmat> what was the command you issued?  zef install App::Rak ?

[11:46] <equinox> BTW i typed "zef upgrade App::Rak"

[11:46] <lizmat> ok

[11:46] <equinox> then tried uninstalling & reinstalling

[11:46] <equinox> same error.

[11:46] <equinox> on Ubuntu and Windows both

[11:49] <lizmat> hmmm... can't repro that  :-(

[11:49] <lizmat> lemme just see if I can get the pinned versions all in sync

[13:57] <Nemokosch> What argument should I specify if I want to use rak as a simple grep on its STDIN?

[13:57] <Nemokosch> If I don't specify anything, it works however it throws warnings (for $source-for being unspecified)

[14:21] <lizmat> interesting... it shouldn't do that
