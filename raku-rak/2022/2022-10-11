[14:17] <[Coke]> I was going to ask why -l wasn't there, but your article covered that. Thanks.

[14:17] <[Coke]> I remember being very annoyed when ack stopped supporting -a; to this day I still type -a from muscle memory and have it yell at me. :)

[14:36] <[Coke]> trying to test on windows now that I can install.

[14:36] <[Coke]> 'rak project <subdir>' just hangs.

[14:37] <[Coke]> after emitting: Unexpected leftoversa: {:paths($["ETP"])}

[14:37] <[Coke]> (typo in my copy here.)

[14:38] <[Coke]> rak - provided by App::Rak 0.1.3, running Raku 6.d with Rakudo 2022.04.42.

[14:40] <[Coke]> added to ticket.

[14:48] <[Coke]> Updating my win rakudo install JIC

[15:40] <[Coke]> so, git bash wonky, only issue so far with powershell/CMD is the bold formatting.

[17:08] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak/main: Old code has served its purpose

[17:09] <lizmat> The problem is really I think that $*IN.t is returning False when it shouldn't 

[17:10] <lizmat> $*IN.t indicates there's something waiting to be read on STDIN, and thus it starts to wait for input

[17:46] <lizmat> [Coke]: OOC so what did ack -a do?

[17:48] <[Coke]> all

[17:48] <lizmat> all what ?

[17:49] <[Coke]> all files

[17:49] <[Coke]> as opposed to text only, or binary, or... javascript

[17:49] <lizmat> rak --find-all --save=a

[17:49] <lizmat> and you're set for -a

[17:49] <[Coke]> (y)
