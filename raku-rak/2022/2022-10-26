[19:39] <equinox> hi & thanks for this!

[19:40] <equinox> quick question: if i only wanted to search current directory and no recursion, i'm doing `--dir="* eq '.'"`; how would you do it?

[19:50] <lizmat> --!dir would do the trick

[19:50] <lizmat> --/dir of course  :-)

[20:07] <equinox> oh thanks

[20:07] <equinox> btw, i have a (very) small PR

[20:07] <equinox> it's literally s/if/given/ in extensions handling part

[20:08] <lizmat> sure... fire it up!  :)
