[14:39] <SmokeMachine> hi there!

[16:32] <lizmat> SmokeMachine o/

[16:33] <lizmat> could you try with --/break?

[17:04] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: that worked! thanks!

[17:05] <lizmat> ok!  Now, maybe that should be default in that case, could you make an issue for that so that it doesn't fall through the cracks ?

[17:07] <SmokeMachine> sure!
