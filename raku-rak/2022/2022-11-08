[10:56] <Nemokosch> Hi, I don't seem to be able to use pagers with the examples in the README. It just doesn't affect the behavior, even though I do have both `more` and `less`

[12:52] <Nemokosch> I returned to an earlier example as well

[12:52] <Nemokosch> > rak '/ initial selection /' --file='*.ends-with("_config")' --files-with-matches | rak --files-from=- '/ further selection /'

[12:52] <Nemokosch> this structure also doesn't work

[12:53] <Nemokosch> "Unexpected leftovers: {:file(-> $_ { #`(Block|68409272) ... }), :files-from("-")}"

[13:09] *** Nemokosch left
[18:47] <lizmat> Nemokosch: could you make issues for these, please ?

[20:26] *** Nemokosch joined
[20:28] <Nemokosch> to be honest, I don't want to put much administration effort into reporting apparent regressions

[20:33] <Nemokosch> an issue template for simple error reports would be encouraging
