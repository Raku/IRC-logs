[11:47] <samebchase> lizmat: Heard of rak today, and installed it immediately. I've always wondered what a command line tool supporting Raku's next-gen regexes would be like. I'm glad you've gone ahead and built it.

[11:48] <samebchase> There need to be more killer apps for Raku like rak.

[11:48] <lizmat> thanks!

[11:49] <lizmat> also: please let me know of any issues / suggestions / comments

[11:51] <samebchase> of course, I would love to be able to contribute to this in any way possible

[11:51] <lizmat> PRs welcome  :-)
