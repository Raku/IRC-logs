[15:42] <SmokeMachine> Hi lizmat! Have you seen this before? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lfXp2iaa/image.png

[15:43] <lizmat> a black bar and a white bar ?

[15:43] <SmokeMachine> oh... it seems to be empty... I'll screenshot again...

[15:43] <SmokeMachine> (sorry)

[15:44] <lizmat> no, that's weird though

[15:45] <lizmat> which version of zef do you have ?

[15:46] <SmokeMachine> I had some dependency problems in the past... maybe that's related to my environment...

[15:46] <SmokeMachine> v0.14.6

[15:46] <lizmat> 0.18.2 is current, perhaps upgrading ?

[15:47] <SmokeMachine> I'm upgrading it...

[15:48] <SmokeMachine> no luck... :( https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Ajq0K9tw/image.png

[15:52] <lizmat> could you try installing App::Rak::Complete ?

[15:52] <lizmat> just as a data point

[15:53] <SmokeMachine> I have installed has-word:ver<0.0.3>:auth<zef:lizmat> and then it was able to install highlighter:ver<0.0.18>:auth<zef:lizmat>...

[15:53] <lizmat> weird

[15:54] <lizmat> could you make an issue for it just in case?

[15:54] <SmokeMachine> but App::Rad changed the error when installing... now it wants Git::Files and couldn't find it...

[15:54] <SmokeMachine> sure

[15:54] <lizmat> thanks!

[15:54] <SmokeMachine> I'll try installing App::Rak::Complete

[15:55] <SmokeMachine> App::Rak::Complete gave the same error as App::Rak... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SjvWVDx3/image.png

[15:56] <SmokeMachine> I don't really think that's a App::Rak's problem... I was getting something like that with other modules too... (even Red)

[15:58] <lizmat> well, I can't reproduce, and if I can't reproduce, I can't fix it :-(

[16:00] <SmokeMachine> now it seems even more strange... App::Rak won't be installed because it couldn't find rat... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/zZQ88kX3/image.png

[16:01] <SmokeMachine> let me test it with a new rake...

[16:01] <SmokeMachine> raku
