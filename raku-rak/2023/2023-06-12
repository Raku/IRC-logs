[01:55] <lucs> This hangs for me:  rak Â§reading https://dev.to/lizmat/its-time-to-rak-part-1-30ji

[01:56] <lucs> (as do other similar remote searches)

[07:18] <lizmat> could you make an issue please ?

[12:04] <lucs> Oh, okay.

[12:04] <lizmat> yeah... otherwise I'm afraid it will fall through the cracks

[12:05] <lucs> Any other info I can supply to help solve it?

[12:06] <lizmat> double check if curl works with the same URL

[12:06] <lizmat> if it doesn't, it's a curl issue  :-)

[12:06] <lucs> I'll check.
