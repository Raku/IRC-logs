[10:30] <Nemokosch> Hi hi

[10:31] <Nemokosch> I was trying to hunt this down but no avail so far... it seems that some files are missing from the lookup, at least with --find

[10:33] <Nemokosch> in particular, I had xls files and they just didn't show up, as long as their content was indeed Excel

[10:34] <Nemokosch> Once I spurted some text into the file, without changing the owner or permissions, it suddenly showed up with rak --find

[10:38] <Nemokosch> okay, it seems that the files were looked up correctly by paths('.')

[10:41] <lizmat> did you specify extensions, or did you assume the default of "what looks like a text file"

[10:41] <lizmat> 2. is it repeatable ?

[10:43] <Nemokosch> This is probably not related but will that adverb bind well?

[10:43] <Nemokosch> > 926      my $sources-seq = %n<sources>:delete // get-sources-seq;

[10:45] <Nemokosch> is "what looks like a text file" the default for rak --find? :(

[11:08] <Nemokosch> is this a bug or a feature? because I "fixed it". I could make a PR.

[11:09] <lizmat> hmmm... it might, I'd have to check

[11:10] <lizmat> the adverb binds ok this way,, would only be an issue if it were on the RHS

[11:10] <lizmat> please make a PR  :-)

[11:11] <lizmat> if anything, it would make the problem and possible solution clear :-)

[11:12] <Nemokosch> eventually, it's a choice. Well, a choice I didn't expect, to the extent of not even considering the possibility.

[11:15] <lizmat> yeah, I guess in the case of --find it should by default really take all files, right ?

[11:16] <Nemokosch> I would say so, yep

[11:17] <lizmat> ok, please make an issue or a PR for it, so it won't fall through the cracks

[11:17] <lizmat> my head in currently in rakuast space  :-)

[11:18] <Nemokosch> understandable :D

[11:21] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak: 2colours++ created pull request #38: Make is-text not default to True if find is set.

[11:21] <Geth> ¦ App-Rak: review: https://github.com/lizmat/App-Rak/pull/38

[11:31] <Nemokosch> What I still haven't gotten around but hope to be able to do is the default for &variables

[11:31] <Nemokosch> which can even be improved compared to the old means, or at least that's what I'd hope

[11:32] <Nemokosch> Callable[T] rather than Callable unconditionally

[11:35] <Nemokosch> anyway, gotta work sometimes :DD &
