[16:04] <lucs> How to show lines containing 'url' only in "â€¦/.git/config" files under the current directory?

[17:52] <lizmat> rak --find .git/config | rak url

[17:52] <lizmat> ?

[17:53] <lizmat> rak url --dir=.git --file=config 

[18:25] <lucs> I had tried the second one, with no luck.

[18:26] <lucs> The first one also appears to fail.

[18:26] <lizmat> hmmm

[18:26] <lizmat> then please make an issue for this...  

[18:26] <lucs> Note that the .git directories are a couple of subdirs down from the current working directory.

[18:26] <lizmat> does

[18:26] <lizmat> rak --find .git/config

[18:26] <lizmat> at least work?

[18:27] <lucs> No :(

[18:30] <lizmat> meh

[18:31] <lizmat> my mind is not in rak mode at the moment  :-(

[18:32] <lucs> Okay. I'll let you know if I figure out anything.

[18:32] <lizmat> thanks!

[18:32] <lizmat> PRs welcome!

[18:33] <lucs> Yep :)

[18:33] <lucs> (Looks like it's the prefix '.' in ".git" that might be interfering.)

[18:34] <lizmat> hmmm... could be

[18:46] <lucs> Welp, for now, this works, and I'll leave it at that:

[18:47] <lucs> rak --find .git/config --dir | xargs rak url

[18:57] <lizmat> rak --find .git/config --dir | rak --files-from=- url

[18:57] <lizmat> that's without needing xargs

[19:50] <lucs> Ah, cool. Thanks.
