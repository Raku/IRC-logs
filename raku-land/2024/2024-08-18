[20:45] <jjatria> lizmat: will look into the GitLab updated logic snafu, and thanks for looking into that Terminal::WCWidth distro! I had forgot about my patch :P 

[20:45] <jjatria> Also: newborns are a lot of work ðŸ’¦ 

[20:49] <JRaspass> I suspect/hole there's a different field we can use in the Git{Lab,Hub} GraphQL to get the last commit rather than last change

[20:49] <JRaspass> *hope
