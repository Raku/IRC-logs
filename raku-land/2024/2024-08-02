[22:25] <sjn> hey, are any of you up for having a chat about metadata in raku.land?

[22:26] <sjn> well. raku.land, and the packages it helps distribute

[22:27] <sjn> (what zef outputs may also be relevant, btw)

[22:29] * sjn has done a somewhat sizable work on this topic on behalf of the CPAN Security Group, in preparation of those new regulations coming all over the place (US, EU, Singapore and Japan for now), and I'm thinking having a sync around the Raku package ecosystem is probably a good idea

[22:29] <sjn> if someone wants to/has tuits/cares about such things, of course
