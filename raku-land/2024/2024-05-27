[13:11] <tbrowder> if i want to work on raku.land prs, how do i do that using github?

[13:13] <lizmat> you don't, you'd need to work on gitlab

[13:13] <lizmat> ?

[13:55] <tbrowder> hm, ok. i looked at lots of places comparing gitlab, github, etc. the casual survey said github is best for FOSS because of ease of use for helpers. i do think raku.land would be best if moved to github. my 2 cents

[13:56] <tbrowder> and no offense to its developer, it's an important project but it needs love to be more useful

[13:59] <tbrowder> for instance, dingbats like moi need some way to have bad modules in zef/fez flagged as such. that should be relatively easy to do with zef/raku.land interface

[14:04] <lizmat> re github vs gitlab: some people do not want to be involved with Github anymore because of MS

[14:04] <lizmat> and we have to accept that

[14:42] <tbrowder> lizmat, we don't accept behavior we don't like, so, in some way, what is the difference? imho, we should be trying to unify the community to grow use of raku. splintering into little-used infra doesn't help. 

[14:42] <tbrowder> i love raku. i want to see if grow.

[14:42] <tbrowder> *it

[14:43] <tbrowder> the avg age of users is not decreasing

[14:44] <lizmat> true, but we're all volunteers, and if a volunteer decides to open source their project on a different place than that we're used to

[14:44] <lizmat> there's not a lot we can do but to kindly ask them if they'd be willing to move

[14:45] <lizmat> and that question has been asked in the past, and the answer was no

[14:45] <lizmat> so we will have to either live with it, or set up a similar service of your own

[14:45] <lizmat> I chose live with it  :-)

[14:46] <tbrowder> sigh..., ok then, thnx

[16:43] <jjatria> FWIW, I think I'm on the record as saying that I don't really care where the code is hosted, but that it would be a pity if we got to a point where things _had_ to be hosted on a specific platform for them to work

[16:43] <jjatria> In that sense, I'm more against monopolies than I am against MS

[16:44] <jjatria> But if there's a feature someone would want to implement on RL, and they prefer the GH interface, I'd be happy to review a GH fork and make sure the code ends up where it needs to be, even if we don't move away from GL

[17:43] <coleman> GitLab even lets you log in with a GitHub account. It's quite accessible.

[17:45] <coleman> jjatria: if you haven't already, a GitLab->GitHub read-only push fork could aid discoverability. Then, if you are willing, people could indeed fork that and you could review the diffs if you so choose. But to be honest, I think we are too concentrated on GitHub, but it is hard to unwind, because we use GitHub authorization groups to govern some important stuff.

[17:47] <coleman> Actually, a pull-fork from GitHub might be easier...

[17:54] <coleman> Ah it looks like GitHub doesn't do automatic mirroring
