[13:40] <lizmat> JRaspass jjatria just a note that the harvesting of Raku land frequently is aborted because of a 403 HTPP status somewhere

[13:40] <lizmat> 403 Forbidden

[13:40] <lizmat>   in method request at /usr/share/perl6/site/sources/9FC2343A87BDDB635A0B9DEF0D5BB8AFBC23C471 (HTTP::Tiny) line 356

[13:40] <lizmat> ...

[13:41] <lizmat> Command exited with non-zero status 1

[13:41] <lizmat> bin/parse:  72.89s 7882128k

[13:42] <lizmat> feels like it is some kind of load related thing, as it also just passes as well

[19:39] <jjatria> Hmmm... thanks for the reminder. Will have to look into it. I'll open an issue on the repo for now

[19:44] <JRaspass> I guess we ought to return which server is giving us that error, I suspect it's the zef meta api

[19:45] <lizmat> what is that?

[19:45] <lizmat> https://360.zef.pm ??

[20:08] <JRaspass> Yep

[20:08] <JRaspass> We also hit github/gitlab/codeberg, so it could be any of those

[20:11] <lizmat> I've never seen a 403 on 360.zef.pm

[20:21] <JRaspass> Yeah I wonder if it's rate limiting related

[20:22] <lizmat> yeah, it feels like that
