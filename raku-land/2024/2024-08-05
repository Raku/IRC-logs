[20:59] <sjn> tonyo: well, "changes are afoot", one could say. :-)

[21:00] <sjn> I'm happy to share some of my findings (and I think these are likely to be super useful and/or interesting in addition to important and reqiured) â€“ if someone here is interested :-)

[21:02] <sjn> there several concerns to be aware of regarding metadata fields, their whys and whats, and on how this metadata should be updated and later made available to the different actors/roles/services found throughout the ecosystems and supply-chain

[21:11] <jjatria> sjn: raku.land only aggregates data from other sources (mainly, the META files from the distributions uploaded to the various ecosystems, and the author / org data exposed by zef). So we will reflect the changes in the data upstream 

[21:12] <jjatria> I'm interested in the work of the CPAN security group in general, but I might find it difficult to find time to talk soonish (I've got a newborn at home)

[21:35] <sjn> jjatria: no hurries, though some of the material may require a good think/discussion :-)

[21:37] <sjn> jjatria: are you planning on attending LPW?
