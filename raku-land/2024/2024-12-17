[12:28] <lizmat> JRaspass jjatria on https://raku.land/stats what does the frequency in the Year column mean exactly?  First publication ?

[18:58] <jjatria> That's the percentage of distributions that have had their latest release on a given year. So for example, right now, there's two distributions that had their most recent release in 2014 (!), which accounts for a 0.1% of all the distributions we index

[19:00] <lizmat> understood, thanks!
