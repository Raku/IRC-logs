[23:12] *** renormalist joined
[23:16] <renormalist> Hello all. I'm new (or back) in Raku. One small warmup question: Is "fez meta" expected to update my author info on raku land, e.g. https://raku.land/zef:renormalist ?

[23:17] <renormalist> I did that several times today but it doesn't show info like it does for others (eg https://raku.land/github:scovit).

[23:19] <renormalist> My IRC is not yet back on tmux+irssi, I just the web client as linked on raku.land, I hope this stays connected when I now go to sleep. Good night everyone. :-)
