[14:41] <jjatria> sjn: I am! I'll be giving a talk about my Perl OpenTelemetry work. We should be able to catch up there if not sooner

[15:19] <sjn> ok, cool

[15:19] * sjn needs to submit a talk too

[15:19] <sjn> and find a place to stay, and a flight to catch...

[16:34] <lizmat> jjatria: I'm seeing some updated of modules on gitlab, e.g. https://raku.land/gitlab:stmuk/Task::Galaxy

[16:34] <lizmat> the only reason I think this was done, is that I left an issue there that it would not be updated anymore

[16:35] <lizmat> https://gitlab.com/stmuk/p6-task-galaxy/-/issues/2

[16:35] <lizmat> seems like adding an issue triggers "new module" logic?

[18:36] <tonyo> i'd be interested to know too since i make available the metadata authors would like public via zef eco

[19:59] <lizmat> jjatria: Interested in taking over Terminal::WCWidth, or shall I move it to the Raku Community modules?  https://github.com/bluebear94/Math-Random/issues/3#issuecomment-2271825298
