[11:26] <lizmat> it looks like there is at least one module in the zef ecosystem, that is also on the old "git" ecosystem

[11:26] <lizmat> https://raku.land/github:stuart-little/File::Directory::Bubble

[11:26] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:stuart-little/File::Directory::Bubble

[11:27] <lizmat> they point basically to the same thing, as the META of the "git: version lists "zef:stuart-little" as the auth

[11:27] <lizmat> I guess the easiest way would be to just remove these from the old "git" ecosystem

[11:31] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/commit/a19ebb6c6e   # just for reference

[11:42] <JRaspass> nice, the first url should go away on a re-index then

[11:57] <lizmat> actually, I'm thinking on restoring them temporarily, so that I can create tar files of previous versions

[12:22] <JRaspass> make sense

[12:29] <lizmat> hmmm... no need, all the other versions are already on the zef ecosystem by the looks of it

[12:32] <JRaspass> perfect, looks like its gone from m.r.o too

[14:07] <lizmat> one more module visible on raku.land: https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem/commit/bc5226ad53

[15:48] <tonyo> the p6c should eventually go away

[15:49] <tonyo> i think once groups is complete it's possible

[15:52] <lizmat> tonyo: I assume you're ok removing all of your modules in the old ecosystem (as they live in the zef ecosystem now)

[15:52] <lizmat> it caused duplications on raku.land and modules.raku.org

[15:52] <tonyo> yea

[15:52] <tonyo> not all of them, a few are on p6c still and not in zef

[15:53] <tonyo> i can take a look later today

[15:53] <lizmat> I checked all the ones in the META.list: they *all* existed in zef as well

[15:54] <lizmat> hmmm... I was going by raku.land results

[15:54] <lizmat> I probably should have gone by what 360.zef.pm told me

[15:58] <lizmat> I'll keep monitoring https://raku.land/zef:tony-o and see if any disappear from the 40 that are on there now

[16:17] <tonyo> you removed them?

[16:31] <lizmat> tonyo: yes
