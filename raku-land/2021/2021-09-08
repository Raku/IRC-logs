[16:36] <lizmat> JRaspass: I've been uploading about 20 modules today to the zef ecosystem

[16:37] <lizmat> I've verified they can all be installed using zef

[16:37] <lizmat> yet none of them appear on raku.land

[16:37] <lizmat> is there something I need to do still ?

[16:44] <tonyo> there's a job that runs on the hour and then they should get indexed

[16:47] <lizmat> so then they should show up on raku.land, right?

[16:47] <lizmat> in the recent dists list, right?

[16:48] <lizmat> https://raku.land/cpan:ELIZABETH/Array::Sorted::Util  is now at 0.0.7 and uploaded today (more than 6 hours ago)

[16:48] <lizmat> aaah

[16:48] <lizmat> and https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Array::Sorted::Util is a 404

[16:51] *** lizmat_ joined
[16:54] <tonyo> i wonder if the ingestor can't find the META in that tar/gz

[16:54] <tonyo> i think it should, though because the cpan stuff finds it

[16:57] <lizmat> tonyo: so basically the same thing that fez is complaining about

[16:57] <lizmat> but which is ok for zef or the indexer

[17:06] <tonyo> the indexer?

[17:06] <tonyo> that's a guess, i don't know for sure

[18:18] <lizmat> well, if it wouldn't be indexed, how could I install a module with zef then?

[18:30] <tonyo> indexed by what?

[18:32] <lizmat> the zef indexer?

[18:32] <lizmat> sorry, lost context

[18:32] <lizmat> I mean, zef, or the indexer that raku.land uses

[18:39] <tonyo> well, fez uses a different indexer than rl

[18:39] <tonyo> i'd have to look at the ingestor for rl to know if it's just an incompatibility between it and rl

[18:52] <lizmat> looks like modules.raku.org knows about the modules I uploaded: https://modules.raku.org/dist/Array::Sorted::Util:zef:zef:lizmat

[18:52] <lizmat> compared to: https://modules.raku.org/dist/Array::Sorted::Util:cpan:ELIZABETH

[18:52] <lizmat> now I *do* wonder about the double zef: in that URL

[18:53] <lizmat> and it apparently cannot find the version either

[18:54] <lizmat> however, the version is clearly in the META: https://modules.raku.org/dist/Array::Sorted::Util:zef:zef:lizmat/META6.json

[19:02] <lizmat> ok, I guess I'll halt moving modules to fez for now

[19:02] <lizmat> wouldn't mind redoing the 25+ that I've done so far

[19:02] <lizmat> don't want to redo all of them  :-)

[19:04] <tonyo> it's not an issue with fez or zef, it's an issue with the consumers

[19:05] <tonyo> the fez indexer clearly shows 0.0.7 for the version

[19:06] <tonyo> Array::Sorted::Util is indexed for fez @ 360.zef.pm (it's item 277 in that blob)

[20:38] <JRaspass> oh i think i know why RL is broken, is a key needed to read the json file now tonyo?

[20:38] <JRaspass> i get an xml error fetching https://360.zef.pm/cache/zef/index.json

[20:39] <JRaspass> ignore me, i'm not reading my code correctly

[20:39] <JRaspass> carry on, but yeah i'm debugging your issue liz :-P

[20:56] <JRaspass> lizmat I've worked it out, your tarballs have a nested directory that others lack: bfda98b8b8eb1125c89ad125303871c2a7edcb65/Array-Sorted-Util-0.0.7/META6.json vs 49f69ac09a574065d3824151f8f8ba41cca9af0c/META6.json for example

[20:58] <JRaspass> I have logic to deal with this with cpan tarballs but not zef, time i made it generic then

[21:10] <tonyo> mi6 packages the modules that way ^

[21:15] <JRaspass> ah gotcha, i best support it then :-P

[21:15] <JRaspass> i just used tar ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[21:16] <JRaspass> I guess I should consider the route wherever the meta file resides, one of the cpan dists has two folders which really confuses my logic

[21:17] <JRaspass> not two nested, two adjacent

[21:18] <tonyo> excellent

[21:55] <lizmat> JRaspass++   so I guess that means I can continue moving my modules to the zef ecosystem

[21:57] <JRaspass> sure, i should have a working patch to handle directories in tar tonight

[22:08] <JRaspass> ah this one is funky: "releases/eigenstates-0.0.2/META6.json"

[22:08] <lizmat> ah?

[22:08] <lizmat> that is a bad tar file

[22:08] <lizmat> just ignore it

[22:08] <lizmat> I should probably just remove it from zef

[22:08] <JRaspass> oh, i was just going to handle any depth

[22:09] <lizmat> no, please don't:: that releases dir is an artefact

[22:09] <lizmat> I just keep all previous releases in there

[22:09] <lizmat> it should not have been part of the tar file

[22:09] <JRaspass> oh poo, i'm extracting the first meta6.json i see, this complicates things

[22:10] <JRaspass> ah yes, ill make it a depth search, ta for the heads up

[22:10] <JRaspass> Seq $metas = $(("releases/eigenstates-0.0.2/META6.json", "releases/eigenstates-0.0.4/META6.json", "releases/eigenstates-0.0.3/META6.json", "releases/eigenstates-0.0.1/META6.json", "META6.json").Seq)

[22:50] <JRaspass> lizmat all the dists! https://raku.land/zef:lizmat fixed via https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/commit/81354a91

[22:52] <lizmat> JRaspass++

[22:54] <lizmat> will continue with migration tomorrow, only about 100 to go  :-)

[22:54] <lizmat> sleep&

[23:01] <JRaspass> only 100 lol

[23:05] <JRaspass> those should bring the zef %age right up on https://raku.land/stats
