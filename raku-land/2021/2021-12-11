[17:10] <JRaspass> tonyo: shouldn't the /stats url be keyed on zef username too? atm its just dist name but they're not unique afaik

[17:12] <JRaspass> the old code did "GROUP BY auth, name", i don't think it makes sense to consider download stats shared for dists with the same name but a different author but im not sure

[22:39] <tonyo> oops, you're absolutely right
