[10:48] <lizmat> JRaspass: something I just noticed:   when searching for Config, that module is not present in the suggestions, but it *is* found when searching for it

[21:09] <JRaspass> interesting, i wonder if we ought to prioritise exact matches in the autocomplete, atm its ordered by stars

[21:10] <JRaspass> and limited to the top ten, so raw Config just happens to fall off the end

[21:11] <JRaspass> oh it has null stars because we don't have repo data for it, so it actually ranks lower than the zero stars, yeah that seems a tad unfair

[21:12] <JRaspass> stars are a crappy metric but we wanted to avoid the issue metacpan has where "moo" doesn't even offer "Moo" on metacpan, but yeah i think putting any exact match first is a good compromise

[21:13] <JRaspass> `ORDER BY name = $1 DESC, stars DESC NULLS LAST, name` seems to behave well in my limited testing thus far
