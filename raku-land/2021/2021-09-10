[09:51] <lizmat> 400!

[12:09] <lizmat> JRaspass jjatria where is the email info obtained on pages such as https://raku.land/zef:lizmat ?

[12:10] <lizmat> in the case of zef I guess it's the fez meta info

[12:10] <lizmat> but what for CPAN?

[12:10] <JRaspass> from https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/fez#meta for zef stuff

[12:11] <JRaspass> https://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.xml for cpan

[12:11] <JRaspass> github/gitlab graphql apis for p6c

[12:12] <lizmat> JRaspass++   # update my meta info at the right places :-)

[12:12] <lizmat> *updated

[12:13] <JRaspass> should be picked up by the next reload then, coolio, avatar is from gravatar

[12:14] <JRaspass> '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/' || CASE WHEN id LIKE 'cpan:%' THEN md5(lower(substr(id, 6)) || '@cpan.org') ELSE md5(lower(COALESCE(email, id))) END || '?d=identicon'

[12:14] <lizmat> there's still 2 modules or so that create some issues with App::Mi6

[12:15] <JRaspass> as in they don't package correctly or aren't being indexed correctly? if the latter i could have a poke?

[12:16] <lizmat> in one case, it's the version lookup logic not grokking Acme::ಠ_ಠ

[12:16] <lizmat> and in the case of uniname-words, it insists in using 6.c as the version, instead of the version I tell it to

[12:16] <JRaspass> yeah version logic is complicated, i needed to be able to sort by version in postgres so it currently rejects a handful of dists :-(

[12:17] <lizmat> JRaspass: yeah, the version is ok, it's just that App::Mi6 cannot find it due to the funky module name

[12:17] <JRaspass> right gotcha

[12:17] <JRaspass> yeah we also don't support one of alexdaniel's crazy dists

[12:17] <lizmat> I still don't know what's going on with uniname-words

[12:17] <JRaspass> he had a null one (postgres can't store nulls in strings) and one that's an empty string (no idea how to make a url for that)

[12:18] <JRaspass> but yours is just funky unicode, seems like an mi6 bug to me

[12:21] <lizmat> yeah, that one is

[12:23] <JRaspass> was the cpan one packaged manually? it seems to have the correct version https://raku.land/cpan:ELIZABETH/Acme::%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0

[12:40] <lizmat> yeah, I wonder how that ever got uploaded :-)

[13:58] <lizmat> JRaspass: why is https://raku.land/github:lizmat/IRC::Client in the recent uploads ?

[13:58] <lizmat> ah... I see

[13:59] <lizmat> hmmm...

[13:59] <lizmat> I think

[13:59] <lizmat> how can I remove that one?

[13:59] <lizmat> it's not in the ecosystem anymore

[13:59] <lizmat> as in: the old ecosystem repo

[14:00] <JRaspass> yeah github: or gitlab: is p6c

[14:01] <JRaspass> and their update time is just the latest commit

[14:01] <JRaspass> since few people tag releases on git we don't support it

[14:10] <lizmat> ah, it's gone form the Recent Dists now  :-)

[14:19] <lizmat> JRaspass: is there a reason why "cpan:ROBERTLE" is not clickable on https://raku.land/cpan:ROBERTLE/Cache::Async ?

[14:22] <JRaspass> not overly, that's probably good ux improvement

[14:23] <lizmat> yeah, took me a while to realize I could click the name

[14:23] <lizmat> I guess I'll be taking all of Robert Lemmen's published modules under my care

[16:01] <jjatria> zef is up to 11% on the stats page! lizmat++

[16:01] <lizmat> yeah, it's been quite a ride

[17:38] <lizmat> meh, the JSON::Fast that is shown on raku.land is not at all what you get when you do zef install JSON::Fast

[17:39] <lizmat> it's because the git version has a higher version number

[17:39] <lizmat> I guess the cpan one should be removed, I'll ping timo

[17:45] <JRaspass> hmm why don't we have the git one on the site? is it on the p6c meta.list?

[17:45] <JRaspass> m.r.o only has the cpan one too https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=json%3A%3Afast

[17:46] <lizmat> I'm not sure

[17:46] <lizmat> ran into that trying to tighten some dependencies

[17:48] <lizmat> something else: would it be possible to order modules on the author page by age?  (youngest uploads first)

[17:48] <lizmat> so there are two Config::Parser::json modules in the ecosystem

[17:49] <lizmat> one by the late Robert Lemmen, and one by someone else which has a higher version number but which does not install because of test errors  :-(

[17:54] <lizmat> and the one by Robert Lemmen also doesn't pass its tests :-(

[17:54] <lizmat> grrr

[18:17] <JRaspass> sure, adding the ability to sort the headings seems sane

[18:17] <lizmat> also for the home page

[18:18] <lizmat> having 6pm as the first module you seen on raku.land and then see it hasn't been touched for 2 years...   bad intro

[18:24] <lizmat> *see
