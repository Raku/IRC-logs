[20:54] <lizmat> JRaspass: I just notice that on a page such as https://raku.land/cpan:JNTHN/Cro::HTTP

[20:55] <lizmat> the version that is activeis an old one (0.8.2.2) rather than the most recent (0.8.6)

[20:55] <lizmat> looks like the versions with 4 parts are sorted before the ones with 3 parts ?

[21:06] <tonyo> it gets sorted that way in zef too

[21:07] <lizmat> isn't that... wrong ?

[21:08] <lizmat> afk for the rest of the day&

[21:09] <JRaspass> ooo 4 part versions, that's a fun one

[21:11] <JRaspass> I guess I ought to agree with raku: $ raku -e 'say max v0.8.2.2, v0.8.6' # v0.8.6

[21:22] <JRaspass> oh i think it's a shocking bug in the sql

[21:22] <JRaspass> good spot

[21:27] <tonyo> the version comparison in raku is more than just parts comparison

[21:28] <tonyo> ~ ‚ù± raku -e 'say max Version.new("0.8.a"), v0.8.5'                                                                                                                                                                     (base)

[21:28] <tonyo> v0.8.5

[21:41] <JRaspass> yeah raku's is smarter than mine, but my bug was silly, it's fixed now

[21:41] <JRaspass> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/commit/f1ed9247

[21:42] <JRaspass> i probably need to port more logic to mine but it also needs proper service tests with a spun up pg, this'll do for now
