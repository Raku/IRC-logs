[09:53] <jjatria> Some more thoughts on module de-duplication: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/pb8z3r/insightfull_response_to_my_rakuland_question/haellpg

[16:03] <tonyo_> a con for adjust meta is that it isn't supported not only by tooling but also rakudo where that spec is NYI

[16:03] <lizmat> well, maybe that spec needs to be de-NYI'd

[16:03] <tonyo_> i don't disagree

[16:40] <jjatria> There's a lot in S22 that seems very interesting to me, in that it offers interesting possibilities

[16:41] <jjatria> I'm just think that we will not be able to de-NYI (lol) some of them until we get the semantics down pat

[16:51] <lizmat> well, that was the problem at the time, and it is the problem now

[16:51] <lizmat> perhaps a good time to start a problem solving issue ?

[17:03] <tonyo_> well, de-nyi'ing it still doesn't solve RL's problem

[17:04] <tonyo_> i wonder what results analyzing the code in lib/ resources/ for similarity %age for dists that match minus "auth" would tell you, if anything

[22:16] <jjatria> That sounds like a lot of hard work. I stand by what I wrote on that comment: as far as raku.land is concerned, I think this should be something that authors need to do and we should support, rather than something we should do without author input

[22:17] <jjatria> Loving all the double negatives in this convo, though :)

[22:17] <jjatria> Or maybe I should say "not hating" :P

[22:32] <tonyo_> speech pattern of where i grew up.  i don't think it's any of RLs problem of de-duplicating

[22:32] <tonyo_> nor should it be
