[10:16] <JRaspass> lizmat: So that actually is 0.9.01 but the version in the meta is wrong: `"version" : "0.9.0"`. The 0.9.0 tarball isn't indexed because like you said the meta is invalid json. Not sure what we can do here when filename and meta disagree, we trust the meta.

[10:17] <lizmat> hmmm.. ok, so you could argue the META in 0.9.01 is also wrong  :-)

[10:17] <lizmat> it just happened to be valid JSON

[10:18] <lizmat> wondering whether we shouldn't reject those cases also

[10:18] <lizmat> hmmm...

[10:18] <JRaspass> i suspect the new eco would?

[10:18] <JRaspass> cpan is just a crapshot :-P

[10:18] <lizmat> true

[10:30] <lizmat> fwiw, I think the version encoded in the distribution name should be used

[10:30] <lizmat> because PAUSE would not allow uploads of the same version encoded in the distribution name, but it *would* allow uploads with a non-matching version in the META.

[10:31] <JRaspass> can't people put any old crap in the filename though? name-with-hyphens-version.tar.gz is just convention?

[10:31] <lizmat> that is also true, but that would imply evil intent

[10:32] <lizmat> it has happened to me that I've uploaded a new version without updating the version in the META  

[10:32] <lizmat> (prior to using App::Mi6   :-)

[10:33] <JRaspass> isn't the meta the primary source of truth though?

[10:33] <JRaspass> and yeah you're not the only one who hasn't bumped

[10:34] <JRaspass> i could maybe see to trusting filename on version only i suppose, it would actually fix a lot of collisions atm where we take the latest only

[10:34] <lizmat> well in the case of CPAN, I'd say that wrt to version, the primary truth is indeed in the filename  :)

[10:35] <JRaspass> im leaning slightly that way, ill try and run some numbers in a bit, i wonder how many dists disagree between filename and meta

[10:35] <JRaspass> in the mean time i have a plan to finally allow crazy versions with letters, which should fix your uniname-words with its v6.c

[10:36] <lizmat> quite a few, it seems

[10:36] <lizmat> ah, no, my mistake

[10:36] <JRaspass> ah FROGGS has a v in the filename, that's rare - `Inline-v1  Inline-v1.1Inline-v1.2  Inline-v1.2.1`

[10:36] <lizmat> yeah, there are others

[10:36] <lizmat> Vikna e.g.

[10:37] <jjatria> So if META is correct but filename is not, we ignore the META?

[10:37] <jjatria> That seems off

[10:37] <JRaspass> we ignore one key of the meta i'd say, just version

[10:38] <JRaspass> i feel dist sites are just hacks upon hacks to cope with the real world, i wonder how bad metacpan's code is :-P

[10:38] <lizmat> Sparky is a case, where there look to be at least 4 versions prior to 0.0.30 with incorrect version in META

[10:39] <JRaspass> yeah i don't think it's that rare

[10:39] <jjatria> I understand why this hack is attractive, but I'm not a fan. I'd lean more towards to not indexing incorrect METAs. I think MetaCPAN also has a "not indexing?" page with some common causes

[11:12] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/178da597106976d33a6eb5d151d38aea

[11:13] <lizmat> list of 70 distributions with version mismatch between META and distribution name

[11:15] <lizmat> only a few of them because of the "v" in the version
