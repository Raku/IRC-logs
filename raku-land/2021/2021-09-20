[08:27] <lizmat> JRaspass: I found a small nit

[08:27] <lizmat> https://raku.land/cpan:ARNE/Game::Amazing?v=0.9.0

[08:27] <lizmat> now, when you try to download that one, you will get 0.9.01

[08:28] <lizmat> which is *not* listed

[08:28] <lizmat> the problem is that 0.9.0 had an invalid META file, corrected apparently in 0.9.01
