[13:38] <lizmat> JRaspass: any idea why Bailador is in there twice?  https://raku.land/?q=Bailador

[13:38] <lizmat> I can only see it once in the old ecosystem ?

[13:39] <lizmat> ah, it's also on cpan:UFOBAT

[16:48] * JRaspass only sees it once, I take it you removed one of them? Maybe I need add some kind of log ðŸ˜‚

[16:50] <lizmat> yeah, removed it  :)
