[08:06] <jjatria> Thanks, everyone! :D 

[08:07] <jjatria> I'm really sad I wasn't able to be at the conference as much as I wanted this weekend, but I'll be watching the talks offline, and the talk on fez is definitely on my list ðŸ’ª

[13:46] <jjatria> tonyo: when you say that there is no web browser for zef at the moment, do you mean something that would basically ignore the other ecosystems? Like, a zef-exclusive browser?

[17:13] <tonyo> jjatria: yea, or somewhere to have a ui to manage your fez persona..eg edit your meta, see your own packages, etc

[17:15] <tonyo> vrurg brought up doing groups a while ago as a way to solve raku community modules, a ui would also make managing that stuff easier
