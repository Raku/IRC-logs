[17:43] <tonyo> fyi, cpan is taking the wrong-ish author.  it's taking it from the cpan author rather than the meta in the package served by cpan

[17:44] <tonyo> have you guys considered setting up apache solr for searching?  it's pretty easy

[19:12] <JRaspass> it's using the cpan author on purpose, we can't trust what people put in the meta

[19:13] <JRaspass> i've used solr in the past but using pg fts is one less service to maintain

[19:13] <JRaspass> the above wasn't an issue in searching, just autocomplete
