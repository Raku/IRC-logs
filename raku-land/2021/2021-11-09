[00:01] <tonyo> lizmat: the cpan note is kind of alarming in that archive, is it fixed in the .tar.gz's META or just in the name of the file?

[00:02] <lizmat> cpan note ?

[00:02] <tonyo> https://github.com/lizmat/REA#note-on-cpan-ecosystem

[00:03] <tonyo> if it's the former then it'll cause issues with people installing from that REA because version specific `use` will fail to find the backpan'd module

[00:05] <lizmat> well, yes...  

[00:05] <lizmat> my argument for the correction is, is that it corrects an error that couldn't be corrected on CPAN itself

[00:06] <lizmat> 2. people wanting to use that module *now* either have not used an auth specific use statement to begin with

[00:06] <lizmat> 3. and if they really want to use that module, they'd need to fix the use statement, or we should implement supersedes somehow

[00:08] * lizmat goes afk for some shuteye&

[04:11] <tonyo> i do agree with the supercedes thing, that problem will be interesting
