[08:18] <lizmat> yeah, and possibly make me #1 *and* #2 in most prolific authors :-)

[11:43] <lizmat> JRaspass: perhaps an idea to only allow each author's name only once on the Prolific Authors list  :-)

[12:42] <JRaspass> that's the de-dupe problem though, its hard to know its the same author, i guess you could de-dupe by display name but that is still vulnerable to someone stealing your spot

[15:21] <lizmat> well, just do a .unique on the string name for now, only in the Prolific Authors list ?

[15:44] <tonyo> curiously there're about 329 modules in the zef eco system, is that stats list de-duping on version?

[15:49] <lizmat> 332 now  :-)

[15:51] <lizmat> 333

[15:54] <lizmat> 334  :-)

[16:22] <lizmat> 340   # and that concludes all of the P5 modules

[16:33] <jjatria> I think the stats list considers unique auth + dist-name pairs, grouping across versions

[16:37] <lizmat> jjatria: indeed it does.... but I feel rather uncomfortable being at the top of the list of Prolific Authors twice   :-)

[19:15] <lizmat> 370

[19:15] <lizmat> and that concludes all of my CPAN Butterfly Plan modules

[19:26] <tonyo> getting close on groups

[19:26] <tonyo> need to handle key management so zef:lizmat can upload for zef:community-modules or whatever

[19:26] <tonyo> but groups can be created

[19:26] * lizmat has done enough migrating for today

[19:27] <lizmat> fwiw, it was not just migrating, but also .pm6 -> .rakumod, adding labels for test results, and a general sanity check

[19:28] <lizmat> afk&
