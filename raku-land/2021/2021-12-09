[00:49] <tonyo> oop, META, yea i'll add that to the endpoint

[00:49] <tonyo> so one req will give you stats & meta

[00:49] <tonyo> unless you want to hit meta more frequently

[08:13] <JRaspass> I'll probably hit the api once per update (which atm is hourly) just because that's easiest for the design, I don't mind if the data behind the API is cached more than that

[08:13] <JRaspass> people probably don't change their meta that frequently

[08:34] <tonyo> There's only 70 or so users at the moment, I'll make it a separate endpoint so I don't have to split it later
