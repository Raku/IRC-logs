[18:12] <p6steve> hi - I am attempting to replicate jj's alpine-raku on M1 ARM

[18:13] <p6steve> all seems good until it fails with this

[18:13] <p6steve> #8 243.7 +++ Creating Raku executable alias

[18:13] <p6steve> #8 243.7 +++ Rakudo installed succesfully!

[18:13] <p6steve> #8 243.7

[18:13] <p6steve> #8 243.7 Rakudo has been built and installed.

[18:13] <p6steve> #8 243.8 Version moar-2021.04 is broken. Refusing to switch to it.

[18:14] <p6steve> so ... my question is "is moarvm likely to work on M1 (if so, any pointers), or I am the wrong side of a big porting effort?"

[18:15] <p6steve> [merelo]
