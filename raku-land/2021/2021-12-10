[17:52] <tonyo> JRaspass: i'm going to rework this so the meta and stats are hosted on 360.zef.pm rather than api

[21:02] <JRaspass> okidoke, no rush just let me know when there's something i can hit

[22:19] <tonyo> okay, both data available at 360.zef.pm/{meta,stats}.json 

[22:19] <tonyo> when you've moved over please lmk so i can remove that db user and close that port

[23:27] <JRaspass> awesome, ill do it tomorrow

[23:33] <tonyo> excellent, thank you
