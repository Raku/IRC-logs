[21:37] <lizmat> JRaspass: searching for modules that are provided by distributions does not seem to work

[21:37] <lizmat> e.g. https://raku.land/?q=Zef%3A%3AInstall

[21:38] <lizmat> and https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/META6.json#L21

[21:39] <lizmat> perhaps the new Ecosystem::Archive module with the REA repo as source, could be helpful  :-)

[21:54] <JRaspass> I'm fairly sure we're only indexing dist name, not modules, classes, roles, etc. This seems to match mro? https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=zef%3A%3Ainstall , I can see how that would be useful but I'm unsure of what of the UI/UX should look like
