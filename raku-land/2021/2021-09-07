[18:29] <tonyo> sorry, i think ssl expired

[18:29] <tonyo> taking a lok

[18:30] <tonyo> look*

[18:33] <tonyo> should come back up..the registrar changed authoritive ns and did not update mine for some reason

[18:34] <tonyo> resolving for me now

[18:35] * lizmat wonders who this is addressed to ?

[18:36] <tonyo> it's for JRaspass 

[18:37] <tonyo> looking into your email issue

[18:37] <lizmat> ah, cool!  :-)

[18:37] <lizmat> want me to do a reset again?

[18:37] <tonyo> gf was running 100k race in the woods and i've been out of cell/internet reception for a few days

[18:38] <lizmat> wow!

[18:38] <lizmat> 100K miles or km?

[18:38] <tonyo> 100km 

[18:39] <lizmat> still way cool  :-)

[18:39] * lizmat typically needs 2-3 days to cycle 100km  :-)

[18:39] <tonyo> she rann 100 miles a couple months ago

[18:39] <tonyo> furthest i've done was 200 miles and it took about 18 hours

[18:40] <tonyo> cycling, def not running

[18:40] <tonyo> can you do the pw reset? the mail service isn't showing anything failed

[18:41] <lizmat> >>= Username: lizmat

[18:41] <lizmat> >>= A reset key was successfully requested, please check your email

[18:42] <lizmat> ok, worked now

[18:42] <lizmat> so what changed?

[18:43] <tonyo> i don't think anything's changed

[18:43] <tonyo> the dns was for a different domain that rakuland uses

[18:45] <JRaspass> tonyo ill try again in a sec, is there a plan to make the data we ingest more official at any point? i still find it weird to access it via a raw db conn

[18:45] <tonyo> JRaspass: you mean like an api?

[18:46] <JRaspass> yeah, off a more official looking domain with zef/fez in the name ;-P

[18:46] <JRaspass> i mean we're showing it as public data on the site, it is effectively public data

[18:46] <JRaspass> a simple join route would suffice

[18:46] <JRaspass> just whack it in an s3 bucket and maybe front it

[18:49] <tonyo> iirc rakuland is showing downloads and author meta info?

[18:49] <tonyo> also, i have a server showing up on friday that is going to run smoke matrices of modules and generate quality scores

[18:50] <JRaspass> yeah, or at least it will resume so once i turn it back on, it was blocking ingestion since there's a bug in pg::db which means it retries forever trying to conn to a host lol

[18:50] <tonyo> ouch on that plus my registrar

[18:50] <tonyo> it's resolving again for me

[18:50] <JRaspass> 3 sec cooldown between but it used up the 1 hour window of each gitlab ci job

[18:51] <tonyo> i'll put something together to do a text dump of both data

[18:51] <tonyo> which way are you consuming download info, by version or by dist name minus version or both?

[18:51] <JRaspass> thanks that would be cool

[18:52] <JRaspass> summing where version is null, i believe that gets me all-time? i thought it would be weird for it to drop to zero when a new version is released, i wonder what npm does

[18:54] <tonyo> that works for me, i was thinking you might be showing all time + version specific

[18:54] <tonyo> i'll dump just that then and if later we want version info, nbd

[18:55] <JRaspass> yeah we could do some kind of sparklines/graph ui too

[18:55] <JRaspass> the dist route needs more work, but its getting there, the new info column on the right is nice imo along with the better md parser

[18:56] <JRaspass> i've restored the code hitting the db, we'll see if the 20:00 BST ingestion works :-)

[18:56] <tonyo> fingers crossed

[18:57] <tonyo> the box is nice looking, i don't see downloads in there

[18:58] <JRaspass> they show up if the data is there

[18:59] <JRaspass> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/views/dist.crotmp#L70

[19:00] <tonyo> ah, wonder if the dns on that server needs flushed so it finds the db host again

[19:02] <JRaspass> we're off to the races https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/jobs/1570300775

[19:03] <tonyo> good news

[19:04] <JRaspass> ah npm shows weekly downloads as a graph, but they also have a lot more downloads than us i suspect

[19:06] <tonyo> i'd suspect one of my early nodejs modules has mrore downloads a week than we do altogether

[19:06] <tonyo> also one of the lamest modules ever written

[19:06] <JRaspass> it worked! 838 downloads - https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/fez

[19:06] <tonyo> https://www.npmjs.com/package/optional

[19:06] <tonyo> awsome

[19:07] <JRaspass> wow, 4 years old and crazy popular, nice one

[19:07] <tonyo> 9 years ago was 0.1

[19:08] <tonyo> and it doesn't work that great

[19:08] <JRaspass> damn, my 9 year old code would be dodgy perl

[19:09] <tonyo> it was just wrapping an awful way to check if a module was available in (now) very old js

[19:11] <JRaspass> yeah i guess require is old hat now with native modules
