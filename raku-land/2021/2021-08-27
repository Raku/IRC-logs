[08:11] <jjatria> I agree that RL is not the best place to implement a method for de-duplicating dists (which is the reason I'm not entirely sold on us relying on metadata at this point at least)

[08:12] <jjatria> But having duplicated dists definitely gets in the way of other features we want to have (eg. citation indices)

[08:13] <jjatria> So I think it makes sense to think about what sort of thing we can accomplish in the meantime, while being aware that whatever we do needs to be something that doesn't paint us into a corner, etc

[16:28] <tonyo_> i can take a look at doing the thing i mentioned above

[16:29] <tonyo_> do you have somewhere that you have all of the code downloaded for RL that i can look at?

[16:29] <tonyo_> code = dist code
