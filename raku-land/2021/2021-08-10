[08:15] <jjatria> Oh, I see. Like, a web interface to fez that would allow the sort of maintenance that you currently do from the command line. A site for authors, rather than users

[08:59] <JRaspass> How would we auth, can fez do openid connect (oauth), does it have a stable obvious url?

[09:00] <JRaspass> Definitely open to expanding the site from strictly r/o
