[23:08] <tonyo> there is a plan for fez to be able to do searching and recommendation handling, re: searching for modules that are provided by distributions does not seem to work

[23:09] <tonyo> the intent is to make it easier for zef to get all the info it needs in one request instead of being required to maintain a local copy of dists

[23:10] <tonyo> but it could be used for something like RL

[23:29] <lizmat> have you looked at https://github.lizmat/REA ?

[23:47] <tonyo> i've seen it, yea.  this is more for the purpose of finding modules and getting all of the dependency resolution from one endpoint

[23:47] <tonyo> with that comes fuzzy matching stuff, i've had good luck with apache solr

[23:48] <lizmat> Isee
