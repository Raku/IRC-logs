[13:45] <JRaspass> tonyo: what's the current plan with org support in zef? would it let me say upload dists under the raku-land org and have say either jjatria or myself do the upload. I'd like to give it a go at some point, there's some parts of raku land that could easily be spun off as sep dists and i would like to see how to make the raku land ui show its an org rather than an individual

[13:45] <JRaspass> i guess the community dists would be a strong candidate for org support too

[14:03] <lizmat> org support is live

[14:04] <lizmat> it is being used for raku-community-modules

[14:04] <lizmat> only App::Mi6 is not entirely up-to-date yet, so some manual changes to the ~/.fez... config file is needed before upload is accepted

[14:05] <JRaspass> oh sweet, i should give it a go then

[14:06] <JRaspass> so this is an org? https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules

[14:07] <JRaspass> needs a camelia logo ;-)

[14:07] <lizmat> yes

[14:09] <JRaspass> i guess the org has no meta set but it would nice if https://360.zef.pm/meta.json or some other api let me query who belonged to the org? do members also have to be zef accounts? i was thinking of putting avatars/links to the members under the org on RL

[14:11] <lizmat> fez org members raku-community-modules

[14:12] <JRaspass> ah its an authorised api, would be nice if it were public for RL - $ fez org members raku-community-modules

[14:12] <JRaspass> =<< Failed. expired

[14:21] <lizmat> well, I guess you could consider membership to be more private generally

[14:22] <lizmat> tonyo: I wouldn't mind if the org had a flag to make membership public knowledge

[14:22] <lizmat> so that fez org members raku-community-modules would work for everybody

[14:42] <JRaspass> that seems a sane compromise to me

[14:44] <JRaspass> btw if you want a logo, its tied to the email address, RL is using gravatar

[14:46] <JRaspass> can orgs have meta? i see no `fez org meta` cmd

[16:12] <tonyo> expired means your token is expired and needs to be refreshed, you should be able to list the members without membership

[16:13] <tonyo> ~â¸¸ fez org members raku-community-modules

[16:13] <tonyo> >>= R Org Name

[16:13] <tonyo> >>= a lizmat

[16:13] <tonyo> >>= m jjmerelo

[16:13] <tonyo> >>= m tbrowder

[18:06] <JRaspass> oh i got that, my point was it would be nice for there to be a public non-authed api for RL

[20:23] <JRaspass> tonyo could we gain meta support for orgs? It would be nice to give this a pretty name, website, etc https://raku.land/zef:raku-land

[20:38] <tonyo> oops, i need to find my phone to get into aws - i think the endpoints exist but need to double check

[20:40] <tonyo> they don't, i'll add that this week

[21:13] <tonyo> i can update the meta manually in the mean time if you'd like

[21:22] <JRaspass> it's cool, i'm happy to wait, thanks

[21:45] <tonyo> fez :ver<35> has `fez org meta <org-name>` added

[21:47] <tonyo> lizmat: ^ relevant for you, as well
