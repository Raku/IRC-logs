[20:22] <lizmat> if it says: "Built 6 hours ago" on raku.land, does that mean there haven't been any module updates for 6 hours?  Or does it mean that the build somehow got stuck?

[22:51] <JRaspass> yeah the build has been getting stuck lately, lots of 502s from github, not sure why yet

[22:51] <JRaspass> you can see the ratio of passing and failing runs here https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/jobs

[23:24] <lizmat> JRaspass: good to see it's building again

[23:25] <lizmat> JRaspass: fwiw, you might find this interesting for your search needs on raku.land: https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Ecosystem#find-identities  :-)
