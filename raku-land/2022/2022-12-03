[00:20] <Nemokosch> No I mean, the presentation makes sense (although it could be a bit more explicit about what the number we see means)

[00:24] <Nemokosch> getting the zef ecosystem (btw don't you think it's seriously confusing to use the same name for ONE particular ecosystem and a tool that can use several ecosystems?) to the top is perhaps the biggest - most visible, at least - achievement of this year
