[16:03] <Guest65> Hello.  I'm having trouble installing Digest:ver<0.18.4>:auth<Lucien Grondin>

[16:05] <Guest65> I'm using rakudo-moar-2022.07-01-linux-x86_64-gcc

[16:06] <Guest65> zef install Digest fails with "Cannot unbox 64 bit wide bigint into native integer"

[16:06] <Guest65> Does anyone know why that might be?

[16:10] <Guest65> Oops, I see its an open issue.  Sorry.
