[16:30] <lizmat> JRaspass: are you aware of the discussion at https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/330 ?

[16:30] <lizmat> any thoughts?

[19:46] <JRaspass> I am, but until literally this hour I've been on holiday in Scotland. I'm planning to add some of the missing features in the near future, like author search. In general I'm happy for more focus and attention to RL but I agree it needs work

[19:47] <JRaspass> in terms of things like renaming/rebranding, not sure how i feel, i'll note that metacpan replaced cpan without doing either of those steps, just the redirect from old to new

[19:49] <lizmat> JRaspass: well... add your comments to the discussion as soon as you're ready!

[19:50] <lizmat> or not  :-)

[19:50] <JRaspass> will do, currently opening doors, windows, and watering wilted plants ðŸ˜‚ 

[20:27] <JRaspass> commented/brain dumped on the issue

[20:35] <lizmat> thanks!
