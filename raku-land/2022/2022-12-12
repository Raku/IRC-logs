[11:29] <lizmat> duplicity is caused by the authors not removing their older versions of a module from p6c / cpan respectively

[11:29] <lizmat> if I notice duplicity with a p6c module, I remove it from the p6c ecosystem

[11:29] <lizmat> I cannot do that for modules on CPAN, the module authors need to do that
