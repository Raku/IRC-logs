[13:05] <lizmat> so I'm counting 122 modules in the ecosystem that do not have a release with a valid version number

[13:05] <lizmat> 11 of which in community-modules

[17:08] <jjatria> We now display reverse dependencies ðŸŽ‰ 

[17:08] <jjatria> It's only a first attempt, though. Ultimately, we'd probably want the entries to link to the relevant distributions. But that means sorting out version linnking

[17:09] <lizmat> jjatria: you might find Ecosystem.reverse-dependencies interesting

[19:12] <lizmat> hmmm... the header AUTHOR is really oddly rendered at the moment

[19:12] <lizmat> e.g. https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Benchmark

[19:42] <jjatria> Wow, that is ... new

[19:49] <JRaspass> it's not new jjatria, its this bug, next on my list https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/21
