[15:50] <tbrowder> JRaspass: raku land is working great on my iPad now.

[15:51] <JRaspass> awesome, happy to hear it

[15:51] <tbrowder> are you going to be able to get a tag search added?

[15:51] <tbrowder> and author?

[15:52] <tbrowder> all the search stuff lizmat put on the old modules site?

[15:53] <tbrowder> wait a minute, let me look at raku.land again...

[15:55] <tbrowder> ok, i see how to get tag-related stuff.

[15:55] <tbrowder> great!

[15:56] <tbrowder> author

[15:57] <tbrowder> i don't see a way to search authors yet

[16:30] <lizmat> tbrowder: fwiw, I've never had anything todo with the old modules site

[16:49] <tbrowder> hm, did you add or add to the help icon (?)?

[16:57] <tbrowder> maybe you pointed the help out to me once, anyhoo, your name is forever in my memory as associated with it   :)

[17:50] <lizmat> could be :-)
