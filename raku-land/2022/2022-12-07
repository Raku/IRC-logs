[18:43] <melezhik> hi rakuland devs

[18:44] <melezhik> since badges have appeared ( which is a really nice feature ), I have some thought how we expand / extend this idea ...

[18:45] <melezhik> I am not sure if you are really interested but hear the thing , what if rakuland had some distro based API where a use could specify ANY badges / meta info DURING fez upload stage

[18:46] <melezhik> so say I want to claim that my distro has been tested against these specific range of rakudos and I just create a file located under .rakuliand or .fez dir in module distro dir and boom, rakuland shows that info in some nice format in badges tab

[18:47] <melezhik> the thing is I want to do that only when I upload a module to fez echo system , because this is only true for the version that is releasing right now

[18:48] <melezhik> so I don't this to be a part of my source control, rather then I want to supply this meta information for a distro (actually a build ) during publishing

[18:49] <melezhik> such type meta data manipulation during release is easy imminent in SparrowCI pipelines how when fez upload is already automated there ...

[18:50] <melezhik> so what you thoughts ? tonyo JRaspass ?

[18:52] <melezhik> ... the thing is I want to do that only when I upload a module to fez echo system and this meta info is only part of specific mod version (distribution) published to a fez / rakuland

[18:53] <tonyo> i have a machine i want to use for smoke testing the fez eco, i just haven't gotten around to writing all of the scripts that need to happen

[18:53] <tonyo> not enough time in my days

[18:53] <tonyo> putting it in a file makes it not forward compatible and an outside system seems better imo

[18:54] <melezhik> what is outside system ? and what do you mean not forward compatible? compatible with what?
