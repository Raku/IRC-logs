[08:38] <jjatria> JRaspass does the ops on this, so it's ultimately his call, but I think I agree: our search needs are still relatively basic, and I find there's plenty of other work that I'd rather see us make progress on first (code rendering, POD rendering, module indexing, etc). I'm not necessarily opposed to it, I just don't think it's justified for now

[08:40] <JRaspass> Does anyone know how m.r.o did it's search? I've not looked, because I guess all we're shooting for for now is feature parity or greater so we can maybe talk about migration efforts
