[20:53] <lizmat> OOC, is there a reason why https://raku.land/stats is so very wide ??  so that most of the statistics aren't visible ?  (at least for me on Safari / Mojave)

[20:54] <lizmat> also: does Year signify the last update or the first release date ?

[21:59] <melezhik> hi rakuland devs!

[22:00] <melezhik> what if I implement  cicd for rakuland, I can convert logic in docker compose into SparrowCI pipeline ...

[22:01] <melezhik> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml

[22:01] <melezhik> so the test instance would spin up and we can have some integration test

[22:02] <melezhik> SparrowCI has postgresql plugin - https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/7039a0d22da4e741b4e419fc80eb310643285aec/sparrow.yaml#L16-L21

[22:02] <melezhik> so the app could be fully integrated with Pg ...

[22:02] <melezhik> just a thought ...

[22:03] <melezhik> I don't think it will take a lot of time, I just need some help with db logic, for example I did not find where db is populated , none of docker/*.yaml file has this logic

[22:18] *** melezhik left
[22:18] <JRaspass> hmm the columns should go vertical when the screen gets narrower lizmat

[22:19] <JRaspass> melezhik the test suite is only unit tests atm, no integration or e2e, so no db needed, yet...

[22:19] <JRaspass> technically xt was the start of that, but tests against a dev instance and isn't automated

[22:20] <JRaspass> sorry i keep forgetting to check this room, ION we now have badges!

[22:23] <lizmat> JRaspass if I make the browser *really* narrow, then they're displayed under each other

[22:23] <lizmat> like 40% of normal width

[22:23] <JRaspass> yeah maybe the cutoff ought to be sooner, it was a fairly hastily created page, there's a lot one could add like drill down

[22:23] <lizmat> as soon as something like 45% of the width, they go wide

[22:24] <lizmat> drill down would be nice  :)

[22:24] <JRaspass> it's the latest year, open to better names that aren't too long ;-)

[22:24] <JRaspass> so yeah it would be nice to drill down into the 4 dists that haven't released since 2014!

[22:25] <JRaspass> there's a lot of dead code out there, that often no longer works due to stuff like GLR etc

[22:30] <lizmat> yup... that would indeed me on my list...

[22:44] <melezhik> .

[22:45] <melezhik> I have started to work on simple SparrowCI pipeline in my fork  - https://gitlab.com/melezhik/raku-land

[22:46] <melezhik> and lets what I can get here, integration tests with Pg db are absolutely possible, but for now, I just want some basic stuff - like here - https://fosstodon.org/@melezhik/109435156545571470

[22:46] <melezhik> or here - https://gitlab.com/melezhik/raku-land/-/blob/master/sparrow.yaml

[22:46] <melezhik> ^^ JRaspass

[22:48] <melezhik> also - just another idea to think about - test against different Linux distros if you guys want to migrate, and against different rakudos, which is probably what you will need for the future, right now as I can see you use 2022.07 - https://gitlab.com/melezhik/raku-land/-/blob/master/docker/app.Dockerfile#L14

[22:49] <JRaspass> i guess im sorta confused what you're trying to achieve, is this just instead of gitlab ci?

[22:51] <melezhik> yes

[22:52] <JRaspass> i see, in the nicest possible way i don't really see the benefit, seems simpler to use the one built into the forge

[22:52] <melezhik> but also not just unit tests

[22:53] <melezhik> which linux os bistro gitlab ci test against? I guess it's just a one, right?

[22:54] <melezhik> so you can't choose different distros ...

[22:54] <JRaspass> i think you can do any os/any distro with github/lab but i don't need that flexibility since RL only has one target

[22:55] <JRaspass> i can see the appeal for a dist, but that's not RL

[22:55] <melezhik> yes, I just mentioning one of the features you have in SparrowCI, not only this

[22:57] <melezhik> also you can test against recent versions of Rakudo, not sure if this is possible out of the box with GitLab CI

[22:58] <melezhik> sooner or later you might want to migrate from 2022.07, yeah? )))

[22:58] <melezhik> so you can see possible issues ahead of time

[22:59] <melezhik> sorry, need to go )))

[23:00] <melezhik> > i think you can do any os/any distro with github/lab - actually you can't . GH only allow to test in ubuntu, pretty much the same story with GitLab

[23:01] <melezhik> you can of course run hosted job runner - but I am talking about the service

[23:02] <melezhik> so only have ubuntu in GH - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources
