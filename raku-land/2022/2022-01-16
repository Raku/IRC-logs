[15:39] <qorg11> How to put a new module in raku.land?

[15:41] <lizmat> basically, upload a tar-file to fez  :-)

[15:42] <lizmat> but more seriously: there are several tools to make that process easier

[15:42] <lizmat> one of them is App::Mi6

[15:42] <lizmat> zef install App::Mi6   and    zef install fez

[15:43] <lizmat> then do: mi6 new Foo::Bar --fez

[15:43] <lizmat> and you'll have the framework for creating a module

[15:43] <lizmat> once you're ready to release, do: mi6 release

[15:44] <lizmat> and it will do all of the stuff for you (provided you have a fez login :-)

[15:47] <JRaspass> There's also p6c and CPAN but for greenfield fez is better imo

[15:51] <lizmat> p6c and CPAN will be both deprecated in the longer term 

[15:52] <lizmat> 1. it doesn't guarantee ownership of a namespace like fez does

[15:52] <lizmat> 2. practically, updates to p6c and CPAN take up to an hour to become visible because of technical reasons
