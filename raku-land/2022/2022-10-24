[13:30] <lizmat> I assume raku.land is supposed to work on iPhones, right?

[13:31] <lizmat> fwiw, I couldn't get it to search: enter something in the search box and it never actually starts searching

[13:31] <lizmat> I assume some JS issue

[13:56] <JRaspass> Is this definitely a webkit issue? Everytime I try on Android it works

[13:56] <lizmat> possibly

[13:56] * lizmat only haz iPhones

[13:57] <JRaspass> Ah, medium term I'm thinking of replacing the native datalist approach with something like https://tarekraafat.github.io/autoComplete.js/ , it's proving too hard to make work nicely

[13:57] <JRaspass> like you can't have it search as soon as you select something, there's no event

[13:58] <lizmat> the odd thing is that it actually does fill the suggestions list, and shows it to you, but you can't select it

[13:58] <JRaspass> weird, there's very little js in the current version since the dropdown is "native"

[13:58] <JRaspass> we're just wiring up a fetch req on type

[15:40] <tonyo> likely the same problem tbrowder was having

[15:41] <JRaspass> yeah

[15:42] <JRaspass> yeah ill go the "fuck it, just use a js lib" route then, and quit trying to do it properly :-P

[15:42] <JRaspass> i looked at metacpan's but they're using jquery ui so i did a bit of googling to settle on autoComplete.js

[15:42] <JRaspass> we can also have "rich" dropdowns with icons, so we could say differentiate between an author and a dist

[16:37] <tonyo> no react?

[16:37] <tonyo> or similar?

[16:44] *** CIAvash left
[16:50] *** CIAvash joined
[17:57] <JRaspass> I'd rather not rewrite the site as an SPA, it's not a great fit, it's not an application like gmail

[19:13] <tonyo> i mean are you using a FE framework, not react specifically

[20:10] <JRaspass> Nah, just normal JS

[20:16] <JRaspass> ooo i can reproduce the unable to search with the gnome browser, it's defo webkit specific, interesting
