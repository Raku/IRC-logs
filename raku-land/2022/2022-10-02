[13:24] <andinus> how would raku.land handle a module published by 2 different authors? 

[13:25] <andinus> say "zef:abc" publishes v0.1.0 and "zef:xyz" publishes v0.2.0 .. i'm wondering if they will show up as different entries or a single one

[13:49] <tonyo> andinus: different auths should show as different dists

[14:14] <andinus> i see

[15:41] <tbrowder> hi, am i

[15:43] <tbrowder> i want to use raku.land but the search window doesn't seem to work well with my touch screen devices (iphone and ipad).

[15:44] <tbrowder> so i wind up using modules.raku.org which seems not to be adding newer modules.
