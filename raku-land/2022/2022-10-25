[01:02] <JRaspass> autoComplete.js is live now, *should* work on iOS

[08:12] <lizmat> yeah, works better now

[08:12] <lizmat> the only thing I sorta expected, is that if you select from the suggestions pull down, that it would immediately go to that page

[08:13] <lizmat> rather than copying the selection into the text box for you to hit enter

[08:35] <JRaspass> it does that for enter, i can see if the API lets me do that for click, let's see what other sites do in that regard

[08:49] <JRaspass> That should work now

[12:59] <lizmat> yeah, it does :-)
