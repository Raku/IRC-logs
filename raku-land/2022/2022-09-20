[09:11] <lizmat> just a thought: do you know if the Github API allows a site such as raku.land add a star to a distribution somehow?

[09:12] <lizmat> provide they have Github credentials, of course

[09:12] <lizmat> similar for Gitlab etc.

[11:08] <JRaspass> The V3 API defo can (the JSON, non graphql one) - PUT /user/starred/:owner/:repo - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11855664/github-star-unstar-in-api

[11:09] <JRaspass> Would be a bit weird in the RL sense though, I don't think it has a github account exactly

[11:09] <JRaspass> Unless you mean doing it on behalf of a user? Maybe if we had oauth login via github

[11:10] <lizmat> on behalf of a user, indeed  :-)

[11:10] <JRaspass> I suspect we'd do it at the site level if/when we did it, so it's source forge agnostic, like how metacpan does it

[11:11] <JRaspass> But yeah the site could conceivably be r/w and not just r/o, it's why I went with pg even though sqlite would've sufficed.

[11:13] <lizmat> it was just a thought, because raku.land shows the number of stars rather prominently  :-)

[11:14] <JRaspass> True, it does put stuff like source hut at a disadvantage

[11:14] <JRaspass> Or any fools using SVN :-P

[11:15] <JRaspass> Not sure I would want to grant a website the ability to star repos for me but maybe that's just me
