[17:10] <Nemokosch> Hello

[17:11] <Nemokosch> > also: does Year signify the last update or the first release date ? 

[17:11] <Nemokosch> seems like we have the same thinking pattern, I came to ask the same question.

[17:13] <Nemokosch> so it's the last update. Well, that's a little bit disappointing.

[18:15] <JRaspass> im confused by the disappointing comment, we have the release dates of all releases of a dist (except p6c obviously) so what is it you'd like to see? From my PoV the point was to highlight how stale the eco system is or isn't

[19:21] <JRaspass> just about to upgrade postgres on live, there will be a few minutes of downtime

[19:28] <lizmat> oki

[19:28] <lizmat> fwiw, if we want to show staleness, then maybe we should group on amount of time since last update?

[19:28] <lizmat> day / week / month / years

[19:29] <JRaspass> sure that would achieve that same, just less maths

[19:30] <JRaspass> i just find it fun to see the shape of the curve of where the dists are

[19:33] <JRaspass> should be back now, on pg 15.1 :-)

[19:41] <lizmat> nice...

[19:42] <lizmat> still good to see that more than half of the modules had an update in the past 2 years

[19:43] <lizmat> BTW, the REA is now at 9K+ unique identities

[19:46] <JRaspass> nice

[19:47] <JRaspass> oh zef is now the top eco, that's very nice

[19:58] <lizmat> yup

[19:59] <lizmat> and a Raku advent about it on the 9th: https://github.com/lizmat/articles/blob/main/something-advent.md#something-old-something-borrowed-something-new-something-stashed
