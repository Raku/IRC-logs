[13:37] <lizmat> Q: so in the past week, Cro got updated to 0.8.7, yet the Recents on Raku.land doesn't list it ?

[13:37] <lizmat> yet when I install with zef, I get 0.8.7 ?

[16:04] <jjatria> Hm, it doesn't appear in the recent releases, but we did pick up on the version number. The date is stuck on 2021, for some reason. Maybe because it's a CPAN release?

[16:05] <jjatria> Actually, the date for the 0.8.7 tag is from back in 2021, so the date is correct: https://github.com/croservices/cro/releases/tag/release-0.8.7

[16:19] <lizmat> intriguing
