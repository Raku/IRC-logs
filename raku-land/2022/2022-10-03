[00:02] <JRaspass> tbrowder: is the different that you need to submit the form after selecting from the autocomplete? This is mainly because we're using a native datalist. I might be able to auto submit the form when you pick a value based on a cursory reading of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30022728/perform-action-when-clicking-html5-datalist-option I *think* that might be the same issue as https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/30

[00:02] <JRaspass> *difference

[00:03] <JRaspass> Oh brain fart, m.r.o doesn't actually have an autocomplete, i was comparing rl to metacpan who search on drop down selection

[02:05] <tbrowder> thnx, i’ll try to record my exact actions and report it here.

[02:12] <tbrowder> ok, on iphone i type in the search window and module names beginning with those letters appear in a list at the bottom near the virtual keyboard

[02:14] <tbrowder> then i select one of the names and it appears in the search window. then i can press “done” or rhe “search” button. but, in neither case does anything happen.

[07:17] <JRaspass> Interesting, I'll fish out an iphone for testing later, thanks
