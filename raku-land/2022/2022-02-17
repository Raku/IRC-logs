[19:05] <lizmat> hmmm... why did Form drop out of raku.land ?

[19:06] <lizmat> the current url in p6c is still valid, is it now ?

[19:06] <lizmat> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raku-community-modules/Form/ffcc58a45c563afc6aa9b2406462e3f909fb4fda/META6.json   to be exact ?

[19:18] <lizmat> aaah... I think I know what happened...  I put in the change in the meta list *after* renaming the master branch

[22:15] <JRaspass> I think you've found a bug lizmat, looks like the GraphQL logic handles branches and tags but not commit SHAs

[22:16] <JRaspass> which is why the ingester (logs in the footer of RL) prints the warnings "Can't find github/raku-community-modules/Form" and one for PSpec

[22:23] <JRaspass> I've filed this issue https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/28

[22:51] <lizmat> ah, ok...  well... *any* URL that produces a META file is legal

[23:13] <JRaspass> oh sure, you didn't do anything wrong, i just need to make the RL code work

[23:16] <JRaspass> and yeah even though any url is legal RL needs to be able to map them to sensible auth/urls/etc, its the same reason we don't yet support github gist dists or some of alexdaniel's more funky naming like nulls and empty string

[23:17] <lizmat> yeah, and I wouldn't bother

[23:17] <lizmat> p6c should be phased out sooner than later

[23:17] <JRaspass> agreed, ill make the SHAs work though, that's a sensible way to freeze older versions imo

[23:17] <lizmat> yeah, that's why I did it...

[23:18] <lizmat> but only in preparation of removing them altogether

[23:18] <JRaspass> i did wonder if RL ought to support rea, that's a bit like backpan right?

[23:19] <lizmat> just for the time between between committing a migrated version of the module, that we don't want people to pick up under the old URL

[23:19] <lizmat> yep...  I did a presentation about it on FOSDEM  :-)

[23:19] <JRaspass> so i guess old ecos won't ever die if we add support for rea

[23:19] <lizmat> but beware: there's already about 7500 identities in it

[23:20] <lizmat> yeah, that's the idea of the REA

[23:20] <lizmat> e.g. all of my modules used to live on CPAN, but no more

[23:20] <lizmat> this week I deleted all of my modules on CPAN

[23:21] <lizmat> they all live in zef nowadays

[23:21] <lizmat> but should one want an older version, the REA has them

[23:21] <lizmat> just do:

[23:21] <lizmat> zef install Zef::Configuration

[23:21] <JRaspass> i don't think i would add support for rea until we supported dist merging, since it would be nice to get to older versions of a cpan dist via the zef dist on rl for example

[23:21] <lizmat> zef-configure enable rea

[23:22] <JRaspass> but dist merging is a complex issue, i did at least ship eco banners on dist lists on RL now making it a little clearer

[23:23] <lizmat> well, you could just have a look at https://github.com/Raku/REA/raw/main/META.json regularly

[23:23] <lizmat> actually https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json

[23:24] <lizmat> and use JSON::Fast::Hyper to read it  :-)

[23:24] <JRaspass> interesting, i'd not seen that before

[23:24] <lizmat> contains the META of (almost) all modules ever in the Raku ecosystem

[23:25] <lizmat> the Ecosystem module provides an API to it  :-)

[23:26] <JRaspass> the note about auth being unreliable for cpan and fixed, did you fix p6c too?

[23:27] <lizmat> yes, the auth is either "github:loginname" or "gitlab:loginname"

[23:27] <JRaspass> i wonder if we have any non github/lab git repos in p6c

[23:27] <JRaspass> in theory we could handle bitbucket, etc

[23:27] <JRaspass> i don't know how we register new prefixes

[23:28] <JRaspass> i guess we just add support to zef

[23:28] <lizmat> there's one pure gist one, as a demo really

[23:28] <lizmat> well... if we would have anybody on bitbucket wanting to do modules on p6c... it could be supportd

[23:28] <lizmat> the module doing that is Ecosystem::Archive::Update

[23:29] <lizmat> anyways, lemme know if you have any questions /suggestions / comments

[23:29] <lizmat> it's time for some sleep here&

[23:29] <JRaspass> yeah ill try and find some time to play with it, ditto

[23:30] <lizmat> if you wanna play: the Ecosystem module also comes with a CLI called "ecosystem"

[23:30] <lizmat> afk&
