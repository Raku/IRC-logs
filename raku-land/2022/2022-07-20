[08:17] <CIAvash> An easier and more detailed contributing guideline would probably help people who would like to contribute. Specially the "Populating the database section", maybe it would also be nice if there were fake dist fixture, instead of downloading modules, If I've understood things correctly.

[09:57] <jjatria> I like that, and it shouldn't be so hard to do. Could be a set of fake dists or maybe some subset of the existing ones. Most of the time, you only need a handful to make sure you didn't break anything
