[19:18] <JRaspass> Sorry tonyo I didn't see your message, I appreciate the offer but I'm really not sure I want to go down that route. I've used solr at $work before and I know it works well but from an ops PoV I'd rather not run an additional complication. Things like not being able to update it in the same transaction as the db make it a little sticky imo. I also believe with enough tweaking  that postgres can be good enough, I just lack the time atm.
