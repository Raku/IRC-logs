[12:37] <lizmat> hmmm... looks like the "Prolific Authors" list is borked?

[12:37] <lizmat> I mean, I know that Jonathan Stowe has way more than 33 modules, and he's not in the list ?

[12:38] <lizmat> hmmm... looks like it is missing a lot of modules generally?

[12:39] <lizmat> JSON::Fast unknown?

[12:39] <lizmat> 794 modules ?

[13:06] <lizmat> it doesn't look like it's missing all items from a particular ecosystem backend, or letters

[13:42] <JRaspass> Ah it might this recent change: invalid input value for enum "from": "Raku" https://raku.land/build, should be fixable

[13:45] <JRaspass> ah it's the Zef bump, it's mapping Perl6 to Raku

[13:46] <lizmat> intriguing

[13:48] <JRaspass> easily fixed, just need to update the enum, might just be able to rename the field instead though if Zef::Dist never reports the old one now

[13:48] <lizmat> cool....  

[13:49] <JRaspass> alter type "from" rename value 'Perl6' to 'Raku'; next ingest should find a lot more dists, i think every dist with a dep is borked atm

[13:57] <JRaspass> only reference to "Perl6" left in the RL codebase is the name of the CPAN directory, I guess that's never changing, not until we kill off CPAN and P6C I guess
