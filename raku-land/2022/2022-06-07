[14:07] <xcanehan> hello !

[14:10] <xcanehan> There is something strange about https://raku.land/?q=pretty%3A%3Atable : 2 versions, but only one gitlab repository

[14:33] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[14:38] <tonyo> xcanehan: those have different authors

[14:38] *** lizmat joined
[14:41] <xcanehan> yes Tonyo. Still, the listed repo is the same and tag 0.0.4 is unavailable.

[14:43] <xcanehan> I thought I could point this little inconsistancy in this canal. I may be wrong, no worries.

[15:12] <tonyo> one of those is showing for me as 0.0.2 and the other 0.0.4

[15:12] <tonyo> either way, it's a flaw in the cpan eco where auth isn't verified and raku considers that bit when determining if the dist is different
