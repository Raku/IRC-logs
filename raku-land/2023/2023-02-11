[12:41] <tbrowder>  hi, i'm not a gitlab user, but i have an account and would like to file an issue. browsing around so far i see no evidence of any open or closed issues. am i missing something? thanks.

[13:32] <JRaspass> tbrowder: do you not see 17 open, 27 closed on this page? https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues

[13:36] <tbrowder> ok, now i see it. when i first clicked the tiny icons i did not notice the tiny "issues" label, i was drawn to the list of "list", "boards", etc.

[13:37] <tbrowder> thanks!

[13:39] <JRaspass> np

[13:40] <JRaspass> tbh i think i prefer github to gitlab but it's probably too late now

[13:50] <tbrowder>  github is easier for sure. i think you would get more help if you moved to github. i'm trying to figure out how to get ssh access to my fork of raku-land on gitlab now, but i'm not sure if it's worth hurting my brain to learn how.  :-)

[21:02] <JRaspass> I guess gitlab is a lot more FLOSS though
