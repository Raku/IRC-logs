[13:22] <lizmat> looks like  https://github.com/thundergnat/Rat-Precise has fallen out of raku.land, while it *is* installable from the fez ecosystem

[13:53] <JRaspass> Where's fez getting it from? REA? Because the repo claims to have moved to fez but I can't find it on https://360.zef.pm

[13:54] <JRaspass> there are a bunch of zef:thundergnat in that URL, but no rat precise afaict

[14:02] <lizmat> hmmm... the REA has one with github: as the auth

[14:02] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku/REA/tree/main/meta/R/Rat::Precise

[14:03] <lizmat> it's not in the p6c ecosystem anymore

[14:03] <lizmat> I guess thundergnat will need to bump
