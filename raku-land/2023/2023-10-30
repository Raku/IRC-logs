[12:48] <rcmlz> Thanks. Looking at 360.zef.pm/stats.json I see that the string "AccountableBagHash" is contained in the json whereas "Prime" is not.

[15:40] <tonyo> something is malfunctioning with the runner

[15:41] <tonyo> and i'm out of sorts with it since i'm moving everything to a new server (the lambda mechanism we're using for the backend disappears from AWS in january so this is my priority at the moment)

[19:56] <rcmlz> I was wondering if it would be possible to generate three new tags: "linux", "macos" and "windows" indicating if the latest release of a module can be installed using "zef install Module::Name"

[19:56] <rcmlz> Currently it is not clear for users (like me), if I can use a module on all three operating systems.

[19:57] <rcmlz> One approach could be to daily install all modules using a github workflow (assuming it can be done in less than 6 hours), generating a JSON like

[19:57] <rcmlz> ```{

[19:57] <rcmlz>   "Benchmark": ["w", "m", "l"],

[19:57] <rcmlz>   "Grammar::Common": ["w", "m", "l"],

[19:57] <rcmlz>   "HTTP::Tiny": ["w", "m", "l"],

[19:57] <rcmlz>   "App::Mi6": [m", "l"],

[19:57] <rcmlz>   "App::Prove6": [m", "l"]

[19:57] <rcmlz> }```

[19:58] <rcmlz> so same approach as for the number of downloads.

[19:59] <rcmlz> Any thoughts or ideas on this?

[20:00] <rcmlz> I played around with this for modules I use. https://github.com/rcmlz/Raku-Module-Health-Check

[20:01] <rcmlz> but I assume having an easy way to tell linux/macos/windows cmpatibility would be beneficial for many users of zef and https://raku.land

[21:18] <tonyo> i have, in the works, a matrix of raku versions/backend/dist/os usability

[21:18] <tonyo> it's not quite ready for public consumption, either

[21:18] <tonyo> oses are: osX, debian, openbsd, and windows
