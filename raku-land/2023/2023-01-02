[11:17] <lizmat> there's something weird going on with Pakku on raku.land

[11:17] <lizmat> https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=Pakku    lists Pakku

[11:18] <lizmat> https://raku.land/?q=Pakku   does not

[11:25] <lizmat> I wonder if it has something to do with the non-numeric version

[17:55] <JRaspass> Yeah we're failing to index that dist at present: "/cache/github/hythm7/Pakku/main: new row for relation "dists" violates check constraint "dists_version_check""

[17:56] <JRaspass> Assuming weird versions are valid then I need to improve the logic, sorting versions is hard!

[18:25] <lizmat> don't we know it!  :-)

[18:27] <lizmat> JRaspass while you're at it, :api should probably be as loosely typed
