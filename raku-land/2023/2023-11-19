[22:54] <Nemokosch> I might as well come here rather than bitch about it somewhere else

[22:55] <Nemokosch> "you won", modules.raku.org is dead and eventually the url got simply rewired to raku.land, with zero progress about the means for 2 years

[22:56] <Nemokosch> why was this not enough? why did you have to pull up a highly sarcastic comment addressed to all the things I have been saying very publicly for a very long time, while also missing the point of it?

[22:59] <Nemokosch> for what it's worth, I even feel I have been much more honest and open about my personal stance on the whole module site question and now when the chance actually came to migrate to raku.land, suddenly it became a problem that not everybody wanted this change
