[17:25] <jjatria> I've been a little frustrated by the tone of some of the discussions around the future of raku.land by people who choose to not be involved in the project. The "Reclaiming what is ours" presentation at the recent Raku conference is, I think, emblematic of the problem

[17:34] <coleman> I will proceed with creating the redirect on Cloudflare from modules.raku.org to raku.land

[20:28] <tonyo> jjatria: what was the reclaiming what is ours?

[21:45] <jjatria> Thanks, coleman++

[23:33] <lizmat> jjatria: to be clear, I consider you part of the Raku community, and raku.land a community project
