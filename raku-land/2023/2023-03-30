[02:33] <tbrowder__> imho, PRs for Raku.land would be more forthcoming if it were hosted on github rather than gitlab

[09:06] <JRaspass> Is there really much difference between the forges?

[09:10] <lizmat> apart from needing another login, I guess not  :-)

[10:21] <jjatria> I mean, most of them do SSO...

[10:21] <lizmat> SSO ?

[10:22] <jjatria> But if you really don't want to us GL, you're free to make a GH clone and a PR on that and we can review it and merge it ourselves

[10:22] <jjatria> Single sign on

[10:22] <lizmat> ah, ok

[10:23] <lizmat> I didn't know GH allowed you to do that (easily?)

[10:23] <lizmat> or would this be a matter of cloning and updating .git/config ?

[10:24] <jjatria> I don't know if GH has like a button to do it, but creating a repo and pushing your local raku.land clone to it is just adding a remote

[10:25] <jjatria> I'm not suggesting this should be "the official way to contribute", but for people who want to contribute and are fundamentally opposed to GL, it is an option

[10:26] <lizmat> understood
