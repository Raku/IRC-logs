[21:08] <NemokoschKiwi> Hello, I wanted to take notice that Pakku as a distribution doesn't show up on raku.land at all, even though zef can find it, and so can modules.raku.org

[21:09] <NemokoschKiwi> Maybe this has something to do with the fact that it has kind of a funny versioning? I don't know but it doesn't seem right
