[17:32] <jjatria> On a happier note, I've been triaging some RL issues, and I've closed a couple and found a couple other that were blocked but are no longer, so yay~

[20:37] <Nemokosch> Different thing. https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/CSV-AutoClass The default selected version is 0.1.0 from roughly one year ago, followed by 0.2.0 the fresh release, and 0.0.1 the initial release.

[20:38] <Nemokosch> I think this is somehow because of the api field being set to 2 in the latest version

[21:40] <jjatria> Oh, interesting. We did make some changes recently to the version sorting to allow for non-numeric versions, etc. Would you mind raising an issue? We can take a look

[22:50] <JRaspass> Oh it's because 0.2.0 has a lowercase "class" in "Autoclass", interesting

[22:50] <JRaspass> so are dist names case insensitive? I honestly don't know

[22:53] <jjatria> `zef search autoclass` can find it insensitively, but zef does not install them if the case doesn't match

[22:54] <jjatria> tbrowder__: is the case-change intentional?

[23:53] <tbrowder__>  i did a drastic, breaking rename of CSV-AutoClass to CSV-Autoclass. It was accdental because of finger fumbling and gross errors in the original. The "new one is api 2, renamed, and released with some fixes, but it still has problems which i am fixing now.
