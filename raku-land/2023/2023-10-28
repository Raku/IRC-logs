[19:44] <lizmat> this just on #raku-beginner: [21:21:01]  <discord-raku-bot>	<rcmlz> some of the modules on raku.land have a download counter badge, some do not. What is required to get such a counter?   For instance that one has a download counter, https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/AccountableBagHash/badges and that one does not https://raku.land/zef:thundergnat/Prime::Factor/badges.  Thank you for your hints.

[20:42] <JRaspass> The downloads just come from https://360.zef.pm/stats.json maybe tonyo would know why some dists don't have them?

[20:42] <tonyo> i'll take a look after the talk
