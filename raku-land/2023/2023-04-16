[18:19] <lizmat> looks like raku.land updates have been stuck since last Thu

[18:28] <JRaspass> Oh? Me looks

[18:31] <lizmat> last one the REA has seen, is Intl::Format::DateTime on 16 Apr

[18:33] <JRaspass> Looks like d8fbf217822aeedcf75d916575c78822445a50ef.tar.gz is a fucked archive

[18:34] <JRaspass> So the ingester ought to not blow up on corrupted archives but I guess it ought to be fixed upstream too, let me see if its still borked if i freshly download it

[18:35] <lizmat> looks like it is an apotd release

[18:36] <JRaspass> Yeah, is https://360.zef.pm/A/PO/APOTD/d8fbf217822aeedcf75d916575c78822445a50ef.tar.gz broken for anyone else?

[18:38] <lizmat> "Damaged tar archive"

[18:38] <lizmat> indeed amaged

[18:38] <lizmat> *d

[18:44] <JRaspass> Hmm https://360.zef.pm/P/RO/PROGRESS_BAR/55ef62e15a50ec8bef1b8f1fe4da7a081efbdb25.tar.gz too?

[18:44] <JRaspass> tonyo is something borked in the storage side?

[18:49] <lizmat> JRaspass yeah, also borked
