[01:21] <tonyo> will take a look shortly, i'm not near enough to reliable internet atm

[08:43] <JRaspass> Thanks, I'm trying to make the ingester more robust so it can at least skip over these broken tars

[21:59] <tonyo> what are the two tars erroring ?

[21:59] <tonyo> i'm wondering if there's a problem with system tar on aws too, since it can read those

[21:59] <tonyo> (or the one i know of)

[22:19] <tonyo> removed those two

[22:19] <tonyo> will be able to look more closely tonight (the files are still there just not in the index file so not reachable except by exact url)

[23:48] <JRaspass> I think there was 3 in total, b994170df10048d10701b424cfcb18e6c9f63855 is the current one complaining
