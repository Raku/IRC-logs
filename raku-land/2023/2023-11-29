[13:13] <jjatria> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/55 <- what to do about popularity?

[19:20] <tonyo> using the repo as the source runs into issues with the upstream changes, eg if i switch from github to gitlab (again) then my repos change.  this has happened a few times, or if i publish some version without the repo link in the META and then add it at some point in the future then i'm also kind of out of luck

[19:21] <tonyo> stripping the auth *might* work if the user uses the same name across backends, eg, Zef:auth<github:ugexe> -> Zef:auth<ugexe> & Zef:auth<ugexe> <- Zef:auth<zef:ugexe>

[19:21] <tonyo> that would require some analysis

[19:33] <tonyo> i'm on the no pop boat, though

[23:50] <JRaspass> We could always go the metacpan route, add user accounts and then let people vote directly on the site

[23:51] <JRaspass> I guess they're all just proxies for quality, upstream river stage is another proxy

[23:51] <JRaspass> As is freshness
