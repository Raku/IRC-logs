[20:39] <hythm> for version 'ava-1', my reasoning is I want to have a version system similar to the one Raku uses 6.c, 6.d ... but instead of using the number first and alphabieical last, I want to use the alphabetical first and number last. new minor version would be (increment the number part) ava-2, ava-3 ..., new major version would be (increment the

[20:39] <hythm> alphabetical part, chose a butterfly name starting with "b"), for example  "brimstone-1", next major version (a butter fly name starting with "c", and so on.

[20:40] <hythm> for version `pup` I would like to get rid of it from the ecosystem if possible, since I was trying different approaches and making a lot of changes, I was not considering it a stable version.

[20:41] <hythm> `pupa`*

[21:20] <JRaspass> ah okay, if its expected to go alphabetically then i think that'll work, i just need to expand my version logic to handle non numeric sections

[21:21] <JRaspass> would be nice to get it onto zef though in the future then you can actually have releases rather than everything comes from master

[21:24] <hythm> yes I plan to move it to fez soon

[21:30] <JRaspass> I've filed a tracking issue on RL, thanks for answering my questions hythm - https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/issues/43
