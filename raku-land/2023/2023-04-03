[09:24] <jjatria> Nemokosch: there is nothing tying raku.land to GitLab or Github, or any other forge. At the end of the day, it's still just a git repository. If you or anyone else prefers to make contributions on Github or email or whatever else, that's fine with us. We welcome contributions regardless of where they are coming from. I've already explained one possible way to do it, but TIMTOWTDI

[09:27] <jjatria> I personally object to the notion that there should be any expectation that there is one specific platform a project _should_ be hosted on. We use git for good reasons, and the fact it's distributed is high up on that list
