[10:20] <lizmat> I see freshness more as a "top 40" thing, to be changing weekly: some algorithm decreasing the value of given stars over time

[10:20] <lizmat> I see "quality" as something more of a "top 2000" thing, an "all-time" bests

[10:20] <lizmat> Dutch people should recognize the "top 40" and "top 2000" references  :-)
