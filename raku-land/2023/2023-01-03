[17:28] <JRaspass> What I don't get about Pakku is in what way is version "ava-1" newer than "papa"? Version.new("ava-1") > Version.new("pupa")' returns false since I suspect its just alphabetical with no number parts. So I don't know how to support weird versions like this. If Pakku was on zef would zef even allow such a version "number"?
