[15:14] <rcmlz> tonyo - regarding the "matrix of raku versions/backend/dist/os usability", maybe there is room for three status level. green=installs successfull with "zef install Modul::Name", yellow=installs, but with tests turned off, like "zef install --/test --/test-depends Modul::Name", red=does not install (currently). Maybe that is overshoot and green/red

[15:14] <rcmlz> is enough. Just a thought ... anyway, having transparency from Module users perspective what installs where is very usefull.

[15:15] <tonyo> agreed, good point on the installs without tests - that's a good metric

[15:18] <rcmlz> Sometimes it is also that modules use e.g. prove6 in their CI/CD tests (like MI6 promotes), which has issues on windows, so it is actually not the module itself that fails but a dependency or even a test dependency ...

[15:18] <rcmlz> Anyway, I have always a very bad feeling when installing things without full test switched on.

[15:20] <rcmlz> But I guess that the transparency introduced by "matrix usability" will have a positive impact on test design.

[15:20] <rcmlz> Looking forward to this. Thank you.
