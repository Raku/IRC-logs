[11:37] <lizmat> raku.land appears down?

[12:07] <lizmat> jjatria raku.land appears down?

[12:26] <lizmat> yeah, it's up again!

[12:40] <JRaspass> yeah that was fun, new hardware, bug in kernel was filling syslog, we ran out of disk space lol

[12:40] <JRaspass> The "fix" was adding "pci=noaer" to grud

[12:40] <JRaspass> *grub

[12:41] <JRaspass> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1521173 for the curious

[12:41] <lizmat> :-)

[12:41] * JRaspass wants to stick to software, hardware sucks :-P

[12:41] <lizmat> FWIW, I've set up an Updown monitor on raku.land: https://updown.io/ko32

[12:42] <JRaspass> status.raku.land emailed me, i was just in a meeting for $dayjob lol

[12:42] <JRaspass> heh we're using the same service i guess then

[12:42] <lizmat> aah...  yeah, I forgot I got to know about Updown through raku.land

[12:43] <lizmat> ok, I'll drop mine then  :-)

[12:43] <JRaspass> okay

[12:43] <JRaspass> well hopefully that's the last of the new box teething problems

[12:44] <JRaspass> the new box executes the raku a bit faster, startup is down to 3.5s from 5s

[12:44] <lizmat> I assume that's starting the web service, right ?

[12:44] <JRaspass> yeah

[12:44] <JRaspass> page response time is much quicker :-P

[12:44] <JRaspass> than that

[12:45] <lizmat> cool that it's faster...   irclogs.raku.org takes about 30 seconds... but then it's reading / parsing 1G of IRC logs at that time  :-)

[12:45] <JRaspass> It's a new Ryzen 7700 from hetzner for the curious

[12:45] <lizmat> cool
