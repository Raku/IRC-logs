[16:50] <lizmat> is there a way to refer to a module just by name, without auth ?

[17:18] <tonyo> by the dist name?

[17:20] <lizmat> yes

[17:50] <lizmat> another feature request: when a dist name matches the query exactly, list it as the first always

[17:50] <lizmat> case in point: https://raku.land/?page=4&q=Test%3A%3AWhen

[17:51] <lizmat> Test::When doesn't show until page 4

[18:58] <JRaspass> ah yes the autocomplete has that sorting but not the search results, that's a good idea
