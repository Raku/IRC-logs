[01:35] <melezhik> Hi! Out of curiosity. Why this module https://raku.land/github:atweiden/Sustenance keeps appearing in the recent updates in Raku land with the same 0.0.1 version ?

[01:37] <melezhik> Seems to https://github.com/atweiden/sustenance it indeed has real changes however version is not bumped . Maybe this a fez issue ? Or it is legit ? To upload to zef without version change ?

[01:42] *** melezhik left
[09:02] <lizmat> that's the problem: it is *not* uploaded to zef, it only exists in p6c

[09:32] <Nemokosch> there are still some low-hanging distros in p6c but slowly I suppose it's time to at least turn it off by default in zef

[09:44] <lizmat> it *is* turned off by default in zef

[09:44] <lizmat> the default is --zef --rea

[09:47] <Nemokosch> ohh

[09:47] <Nemokosch> well, rea does contain those distributions as "first-class citizens" though, doesn't it

[09:48] <Nemokosch> what I was thinking of is a way to apply pressure

[09:53] <lizmat> well... the simplest way to apply pressure, would be to remove the offending distributions from p6c

[09:53] <lizmat> it would still be installable through the rea

[09:56] <Nemokosch> that would probably still help (somewhat) with this ever-popping release

[10:09] <lizmat> I think raku.land should actually check for an actual version bump, and ignore if there is none

[10:10] <lizmat> it's what I do for the weekly list manually every week  :-)
