[11:33] <Nemokosch> Hello. This has been bugging me for a while... "Popular Dists" doesn't look good, content-wise. First, "zef" and "cro" are simply duplicated. Second, and this is probably a more fundamental problem: it's full of legacy stuff. I suppose when the ecosystem was pretty much github itself, giving stars to repositories was much more common.

[11:35] <Nemokosch> It's pretty bad marketing that under the name "popular dists", one sees mostly abandoned old stuff. If there is no obvious good way to improve it, I would be all in for removing that part altogether.

[11:36] <lizmat> I agree to an extent: the problem with going by number of stars, you by definition favour longer existing modules

[11:36] <lizmat> also, with people installing through zef, they're mostly unaware that there is something like a github repo at which they can show their appreciation

[11:37] <lizmat> and you need a Github/lab login for that anyway, which many users may not have

[11:40] <lizmat> in any case, at least the Popular Dists should pay attention to the underlying repo, and filter out identities that map to the same repo

[11:41] <lizmat> and a similar check should be done for authors, filtering out identities that map to the same repo

[11:42] <lizmat> I guess someone should make a PR  :-)

[11:44] <Nemokosch> "the more stars on github, the more popular the distribution" isn't a bad approach in theory, however, the outcome does matter. Anything that directs you to Bailador, Alma, panda and even JSON::Tiny to some extent, needs some change. Even showing random distributions by default would be better marketing.

[11:45] <lizmat> perhaps the popular dists should be replaced by "highest number of downloads"

[11:45] <lizmat> this would favour the distributions on zef, which by definition would be more modern

[11:45] <Nemokosch> That may be a better idea

[11:46] <lizmat> as the CPAN / p6c downloads are unknown

[11:46] <lizmat> and since we want to phase out CPAN and p6c as backends, would be an extra incentive for people to move their modules to fz

[11:46] <lizmat> *fez

[11:47] <Nemokosch> of course that's also a compromise but imo a better compromise than the current one, which is mostly biased towards p6c era stuff

[11:47] <lizmat> which, almost by definition, is outdated, bordering on obsolete

[12:02] <Nemokosch> yep
