[09:04] <lizmat> so it looks like no new modules for the past 4 days? 

[09:05] <lizmat> is the ingester stuck again, and/or is the zef upload producing faulty tar files again?

[09:43] <JRaspass> the ingester is working fine, have there been updates?

[09:43] <JRaspass> The logs look normal - https://raku.land/build

[09:43] <lizmat> yeah, it's fez/zef that is at fault

[09:44] <JRaspass> gotcha, i guess neither of the other ecos had had updates either?

[09:44] <lizmat> well, the Whateverable in Recents is a false positive

[09:44] <lizmat> it was just an update in the repo

[09:45] <JRaspass> yep

[09:45] <lizmat> no new version, so the REA ingester ignored that

[09:45] <lizmat> but indeed, no new releases in the other backens

[09:45] <JRaspass> kinda surprised no one updated a p6c or cpan dist in the last 4 days though, i guess zef is taking off

[09:45] <lizmat> yeah, which is a good thing :-)

[09:46] <JRaspass> true true

[09:46] <lizmat> I guess we will have to wait until tonyo wakes up

[09:46] <JRaspass> Yeah

[09:47] <JRaspass> ION I did a little RL dev last night, I don't like that people do it but we now linkify "vague" deps if they're just a name AND that name is unique across all ecos and authors - https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/commit/ca9a127631db

[09:47] <lizmat> and then I guess we will need to talk about making fez more resilient

[16:53] <lizmat> ok, tonyo tells me that uploads to fez are working again now, and I've confirmed that

[16:54] <lizmat> sadly, this also means that any uploads done after Wed, 19 Apr 2023 17:34:36 GMT have gone into a black hole
