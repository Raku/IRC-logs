[10:26] <Nemokosch> Okay, so it's not just me who thinks Gitlab is rather a turnoff. Again, this isn't a technical manner, purely a social one.

[10:30] <Nemokosch> And I think you have this backwards overall... it's not that people actively oppose Gitlab, rather we are completely accustomed to Github, to the extent that it would require some sort of justification to move out of this macroverse for one single project.

[15:50] <tonyo> i like using gitlab more than github

[15:50] <tonyo> just use github for work and it's easier to get at rakudo stuff in github
