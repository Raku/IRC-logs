[16:33] <tonyo> going to be moving the zef eco index to a binary format when i move the infra to raku *only*

[16:34] <tonyo> alternatively i can put an API into the new server if you'd rather go that route and use an API key

[16:35] <tonyo> (where you just request newest modules since the last request)

[17:02] <JRaspass> I presume there would be a Raku module for parsing this index that we could use too? But an API also works, I guess what I'm saying is whatever works for you, I quite like the idea of doing diff updates though like you suggested, would stop future re-scans getting slower and slower.

[17:05] <jjatria> Interesting! I'll be curious to see how that looks üçø 

[18:30] <tonyo> yea for sure, the module will be a part of zef

[18:30] <tonyo> it is essentially just an encoded binary tree index

[18:31] <tonyo> but we're looking at that as it speeds up zef's module resolution by an absurd amount (50kX for exacts and 400% for partials)
