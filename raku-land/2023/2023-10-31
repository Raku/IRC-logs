[06:06] <tonyo> the download counter definitely borked, i'll get it fixed or at least in the process of being fixed tomorrow morning

[09:30] <JRaspass> Thanks tonyo

[16:10] <tonyo> gonna be a big jump, apparently this hasn't been working for a while

[19:23] <tonyo> processor is running, might be a day or so before stats.json gets updated, there's 150k logs it needs to fetch, process, and remove upstream.  new backend should provide a little better insight as to when stuff like this is borked
