[03:21] <JRaspass> The difference is /stats only counts unique dists, so multiple releases for a given dist only show up once, you should get the same total if you sum any of the 4 tables on /stats

[03:21] <JRaspass> So it's the year of the latest release of a given dist

[09:03] <lizmat> ahhh...  ok, thanks for the explanation!
