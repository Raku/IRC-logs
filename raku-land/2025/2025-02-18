[00:22] <jjatria> Seems to be working. Most of the warnings in the build log are about tar (which is sometimes very noisy) and the bottom ones about it not being able to find a repository (which happens sometimes with old repos with faulty METAs). But the site itself is up and working

[14:47] <sjn> yay!
