[12:55] <Guest55> Looks like Raku.land is not being updated over 24 hours

[15:56] <lizmat> JRaspass jjatria ^^   looks like the REA *is* getting updated

[15:58] <lizmat> fwiw the build log https://raku.land/build mentions : Command exited with non-zero status 1

[15:59] <lizmat> but otherwise looks like the update us running every 15 minutes or so?

[21:45] <JRaspass> Hmm looks like we're dying on forbidden, I should really get it to print out the URL, I wonder if it's the zef URL again
