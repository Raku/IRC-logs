[11:53] <lizmat> hmmm.. I've been removing obsolete module references from the p6c module list, but I don't see the number of p6c modules on raku.land going down

[11:54] <lizmat> are the statistic calculated at a different time ?

[11:54] <lizmat> jjatria JRaspass  ?

[11:56] <jjatria> lizmat: you're looking at https://raku.land/stats  ?

[11:56] <lizmat> yes

[11:58] <jjatria> IIRC, that's calculated at ingestion time with the data from the database. The distributions you removed from p6c, are they also gone from the RL index?

[12:02] <lizmat> RL index?

[12:03] <lizmat> isn't ecosystem/META.list authoritative ?

[12:04] <jjatria> RL aggregates data from those sources into its own index, so yeah, it should still be authoritative. RL tries to not be a primary source of any data, if it can avoid it

[12:06] <lizmat> looks like the modules from p6c are indeed gone from the RL index

[12:06] <lizmat> aahh.. and stats is updated now

[12:08] <lizmat> looking at the log now, not sure why it complains about e.g. not finding github/raku-community-modules/ClassX-StrictConstructor ?   whereas https://github.com/raku-community-modules/ClassX-StrictConstructor is defnitely a thing ?

[12:10] <lizmat> anyways, looks like the index didn't complete (as it didn't show the final result table)

[12:10] <lizmat> ok, I'll continue cleaning up p6c's meta list then  :)

[12:10] <lizmat> thanks for looking into it!

[13:37] <lizmat> ok, this one got me puzzled:

[13:37] <lizmat> the error log mentions: github: Could not resolve to a Repository with the name 'lizmat/Object'

[13:38] <lizmat> but I have *no* idea where that could be coming from:  jjatria JRaspass any ideas?

[13:58] <jjatria> Let's look

[14:08] <jjatria> That's a GraphQL error. We construct the query (owner / repo) from the URL we ingested: https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/bin/parse?ref_type=heads#L251 

[14:08] <jjatria> Not sure what distribution in particular is the one that points to `lizmat/Object`, though

[14:09] <lizmat> so it could be a module that lists a dependency incorrectly ?

[15:07] <jjatria> It appears it comes from version 0.0.10 of Object::Trampoline, which lists the URL as "https://github.com/lizmat/Object/Trampoline"

[15:09] <jjatria> In any case, it's more of a warning than an error. That version was indexed correctly: https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Object::Trampoline?v=0.0.10

[15:54] <lizmat> ah, ok, so in that sense, it's unfixable (as it has apparently been fixed in more recent versions)

[16:14] <JRaspass> Regarding immutable errata it might make sense to have a quirks file for overwriting legacy releases

[16:59] <lizmat> looks like I made changes to the p6c ecosystem in the wrong branch today: master instead of "main"

[16:59] <lizmat> the fact that I *did* see changes in raku.land, makes me wonder whether raku.land is maybe still looking at the master branch as well ?

[17:05] <lizmat> yup: https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/blob/master/bin/p6c?ref_type=heads#L17   jjatria JRaspass 

[17:09] <lizmat> https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land/-/merge_requests/11

[21:43] <lizmat> JRaspass: thanks, p6c now down to 371, 15.9%  :-)
