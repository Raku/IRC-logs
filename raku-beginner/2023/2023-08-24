[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> Oh, I should also mention .pick(**) which is like running pick in a loop (where it picks from a pool of n items without duplicates, then starts over again, so for each n items, there will be no duplicate picks.  Appending a batch illustrates that   [0] > ('a'..'c').pick(**).head(15).batch(3) ((a b c) (b a c) (c b a) (c b a) (b a c))

[01:33] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> The J is annoying because it only provides a noun for ALL ascii charcters, and you have to do the ascii math yourself. I just now came up with {{ a. {~ 97 + y ?@:$ 26 }}

[07:56] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I use the folder structure  /bin/ /lib/ /t/  Assuming I have  /lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod (and in Bar.rakumod first line unit module Bar:ver<0.0.1>:authrcmlz@github.com;) and marking functions I want to export as "is export" like this  proto levenshtein-distance(Str $s1, Str $s2) returns UInt is export {*}  then starting any test or script  #!/usr/bin/env raku  use lib 'lib'; use Foo::Bar;  CommaIDE works fine for me.

[07:59] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> (after telling CommaIDE where "zef" is located CommaIDE also ask to install all missing dependencies listed in META6.json - very nice feature!)

[08:06] *** dakkar joined
[08:12] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> in order to make CommaIDE accepting the symbolic link for zef I edited .idea/workspace.xml manually

[11:31] <wafflus> how do i install modules? zef install Getopt::Long tried various nodules they all fail

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> could you do --verbose and post the output?

[11:36] <wafflus> https://pastebin.com/xAiXSE9x

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm gonna compare it with my system. What OS, Rakudo version and zef version are you using?

[11:40] <wafflus> This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11

[11:40] <wafflus> implementing Perl 6.d. and zef is 0.8.2

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hm, both pretty old

[11:42] <wafflus> i'm also using a windows native version but that one above is the wsl version

[11:42] <wafflus> windows native version has a different problem installing modules

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm also using WSL but with more recent builds

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> we can return to the windows version as well but for now let's try to tackle this one

[11:42] <wafflus> i installed thouirgh sudo apt get

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah I don't think (or at least wouldn't assume) those get regularly updated

[11:44] <wafflus> any alternatives? i can install?

[11:44] <wafflus> ways

[11:44] <wafflus> in wsl?

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> rakubrew.org

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is your friend!

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you want it to work with OS-specific package managers, then https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if it's not so important for you, I'd also recommend Rakubrew

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's what I'm using anyway

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i would be very surprised if the Unix-ish install of rakubrew doesn't just work out of hte box for WSL

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Just copy and paste the following piece of code into a console.      curl https://rakubrew.org/install-on-perl.sh | sh 

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it tends to work on Linux for sure

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> never got it to work on Windows though... despite that it should work in theory

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> works well on macOS

[11:47] <wafflus> yeah windows version seems a little borken with unicode

[11:47] <wafflus> i kind of works for me but unicode does not

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> The Unicode part can be fixed with an environmental variable or maybe a registry setting

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that one I did manage to fix

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> borken == <broken | borked>.any ?

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this "common wisdom" should be collected somewhere tbh

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I only know that Unicode fix because somebody wrote it on this chat at some point

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and I don't know it by heart, only that it exists and it worked üòÖ

[11:49] <wafflus> what do i do?

[11:49] <wafflus> to fix the unicode

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd say for now just try to get a more recent version with Rakubrew and in the meantime I'll try to look that one up...

[11:49] <wafflus> ok i will try those debian instructions with curl?

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> right

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> by the way, this was actually easier than I thought, this was the helpful post: https://5ab5traction5.bearblog.dev/fixing-raku-unicode-display-issues-windows/

[11:51] <wafflus> oh sorry seen that before it din't fix the unicode issues

[11:51] <wafflus> :( ¬†ty anways

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "works on my machine" üòÖ

[11:52] <wafflus> unlucky me :(

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> tbh if that's your only issue running Rakudo on Windows, perhaps you are the lucky one

[11:55] <wafflus> i did curl -1sLf \

[11:55] <wafflus> ¬† 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/nxadm-pkgs/rakudo-pkg/setup.deb.sh' \

[11:55] <wafflus> ¬† | sudo -E bash

[11:55] <wafflus> what do i do next?

[11:57] <wafflus> Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2023.08.

[11:57] <wafflus> Implementing the Raku(R) Programming Language v6.d.

[11:57] <wafflus> Built on MoarVM version 2023.08.

[11:58] <wafflus> is that newer?

[11:58] <wafflus> it;s still v6.2 but he moarvm seems newer

[11:58] <wafflus> it;s still v6.d

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's okay

[11:59] <wafflus> og sorry

[12:00] <wafflus> that was the windows one facepalm

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't want to get into too many details but the premise is that you can continuously upgrade Rakudo and have it behave "the same way"

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Is there a Raku-ish way of making an alias for a function?  proto edit-distance(Str $s1, Str $s2) returns UInt is export {*} multi edit-distance($s1, $s2) { levenshtein-distance($s1, $s2) }

[12:01] <wafflus> i got rakubrew

[12:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> üëç

[12:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then you could run rakubrew download I think

[12:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  # list available versions     rakubrew available          # download and install the latest Rakudo on MoarVM version     rakubrew download      # switch to use that version (substitute the version you just installed)     rakubrew switch moar-2019.11      raku -e 'say "Now running {$*RAKU.compiler.version}!"'

[12:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it pretty much tells you what to do besides that

[12:03] <wafflus> Now running 2023.08!

[12:03] *** jgaz left
[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what about zef --version?

[12:04] <wafflus> one sec

[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> bt wyou can also go raku -v

[12:04] <wafflus> 0.18.3

[12:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> pretty good, I'd still run zef upgrade zef to get to 0.19

[12:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it was released yesterday apparently

[12:05] <wafflus> k cool doing so now

[12:06] <wafflus> do you reccomend rakubrew over rakudo?

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> rakubrew is a tool over rakudo

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> rakubrew is just an installer for rakudo

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it really just installs bundles and lets you compile custom Rakudo instances

[12:06] <wafflus> ohh i thought they where diffrent things for getting raku

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rakubrew "competes" with Rakudo Star, rather

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> its like pyenv

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (for rakudo)

[12:07] <wafflus> ah maybe that is what i meant

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @rcmlz hey, spit it out already üòÑ

[12:07] <wafflus> would you reccomend rarkubrew pver¬† rakudo star?

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Is there a way of making an alias for a function such that .WHY.leading is preserved?  Example: edit-distance and levenshtein-distance are the same, I implemented levenshtein-distance (using various multis) and now want to point edit-distance() to this - and also preserve the documentation such that edit-distance.WHY.leading shows the same as levenshtein-distance.WHY.leading - but whitout repeating myself

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> before the proto.  #|[ Here some awesome documenation ... ] proto levenshtein-distance(Str $s1, Str $s2) returns UInt is export {} proto edit-distance(Str $s1, Str $s2) returns UInt is export {} multi edit-distance($s1, $s2) { levenshtein-distance($s1, $s2) } multi levenshtein-distance("", $s2) {     $s2.chars } multi levenshtein-distance($s1, "") {     $s1.chars } more multis ...

[12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> on Linux surely

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's simple and yet flexible

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> me too

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and on macos

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> on Mac: https://brew.sh works for me

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> on Windows I haven't had much luck with it unfortunately, hopefully it will be fixed at some point

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> homebrew is not really a competitor of rakubrew, it's rather a competitor of apt and yum on Linux distros

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> On Windows, why don't you just spin up a Linux VM with CommaIDE + Raku in it?

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I use WSL

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but in any case, there are always people who use Windows for some reason

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> we don't live in a world where you can just give up on proper Windows support for a scripting language

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> even on mac I much prefer ubuntu ona vm for (raku) dev't

[12:11] <wafflus> i upgrade to the lastest zef

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then could you please re-run zef install --verbose Getopt::Long?

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> otherwise you constantly get hassle with things like ssl libraries and so on

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I saw yesterday a friend fighting with Python and a long requirement.txt on Windows ... gave up and did in inside a VM, all fine.

[12:11] <wafflus> tried zef install Linenoise and it failed

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and see if there is a good change

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Linenoise requires native C stuff for sure

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah that always fails for me - just do Readline instead

[12:12] <wafflus> running a vm to run a simple script seems a bit of a hassle tbh

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so apparently Readline works for you? xD

[12:12] <wafflus> sec i will try Readline

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Tell that the Amazon-Lambda-Folks ...

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well yeah, I have raku outside the vms too ;-)

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> wafflus: I think if you only want a development environment for yourself, you have all the reasons to always go for Linux

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> unless you are doing something platform-specific

[12:13] <wafflus> readline seems to work but confusing it spits out loads of errors

[12:13] <wafflus> when installing

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is a good example of too many choices

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> - Readline is mostly abandoned

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> - Linenoise requires some awareness of C libraries

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @nemokosch did you see my question about function aliases? I fear it got drowned in the recent flood of posts ...

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well it's only to get the repl playing nice

[12:14] <wafflus> i get about 10 of these lol¬† Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.

[12:14] <wafflus> ¬† in method try-load at /home/waffle/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.08/share/perl6/site/sources/02E9D2B1B91A7A6CD0C45BF3F77F7A935B48B373 (Zef) line 155

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> - Terminal::LineEditor is what I mostly use but lately there was a problem after a change to the Termios package

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hopefully it got fixed during this week

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and also it's possible that termios also needs some native tweaking

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> wafflus: I'd say leave that for later, check a pure Raku package for now

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder about Getopt::Long anyway, a pretty useful dist

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's also a thing but could you place your code inside triple backticks?

[12:18] *** vlad_ joined
[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> did not know that - done.

[12:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh right, I can confirm zef prints a lot of bogus lines

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that can very well be a regression but maybe it doesn't ruin the bigger picture

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @rcmlz what if you simply bind the function to another symbol? is that not sufficient?

[12:23] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> is that exported from the .rakumod?

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I suppose if you mark it for export, it should get exported

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> our &edit-distance is export := &levenshtein-distance;

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you probably have some code, don't you

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so I'd say just go ahead and try it

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> thank you

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> did not know about "our"

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it makes the symbols installed into the package associated with the file... I think

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> all test run, works, nice!

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> something like that. I'm not so fond of namespacing in most languages, let alone in Raku

[12:29] *** vlad_ left
[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> wafflus: aside from the spamming, Getopt::Long did install OK for me

[12:31] <wafflus> it seems modules are installing correctly now

[12:32] <wafflus> jsut trying to figure out how to get the short options

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> seems like I left all the code relying on Getopt::Long at the previous company...

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you know about sub MAIN, right?

[12:35] <wafflus> yeah that was i'm using https://raku.land/cpan:LEONT/Getopt::Long i tried both version in the synopsis

[12:35] <wafflus> i jsut get unknown option

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> could you show the code and the call?

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I can't recall any problems with Getopt::Long combined with MAIN

[12:37] <wafflus> k sec

[12:40] <wafflus> https://pastebin.com/qciVhmum

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay okay, and how do you call it?

[12:49] <wafflus> raku main-test.raku --one 4 --two 5 for long options (works) i then tried with -o 4 -t bear Unknown option -o

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> by default it doesn't abbreviate. One obvious way would be to define the abbreviation by hand: Int :o(:$one)

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> from what I understand, there is a way to get this automatically as well, didn't manage so far

[12:53] <wafflus> oh ok ty let me try btw do you reccomend rakudo-moar 2023.06-01 main or

[12:53] <wafflus> rakudo-star 2023.06-01 main on windows?

[12:54] <wafflus> that works btw ty

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is no difference

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "rakudo-star" refers to a bundle

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "rakudo-moar" refers to Rakudo utilizing the MoarVM runtime

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in practice, you will probably always see Rakudo on top of MoarVM

[12:55] <wafflus> should i install rakubrew on top of it as well?

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in practice, the only compiler is Rakudo, and the only properly functional runtime of it is MoarVM

[12:56] <wafflus> k cool

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the rest is only a matter of how you get this tool

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rakubrew is one way to get them: it's a CLI tool maintained by Patrick B√∂ker, he creates the built "images" for it

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rakubrew also lets you install different versions of Rakudo, build them from source, or use a runtime different from MoarVM (which is not super useful at the moment)

[12:57] <wafflus> k atm i'm installing using scoopt

[12:57] <wafflus> scoop

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Rakudo Star is a project for creating Rakudo releases in a "less involved" way

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> they basically create installables from Rakudo on MoarVM, plus some common dists ("modules") preinstalled

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> rakudo-pkg is Claudio Ramirez' effort to provide up-to-date packages for system's package managers like apt or yum

[13:01] <wafflus> i'll gues i will stick with the star one i'm guessing the packages might be usefull

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the end goal is the same: to get a recent Rakudo (usually atop MoarVM, as things stand) installed to the system, preferably with zef working for ease of dist installation

[13:08] <wafflus> this is what happans when i zef install on windows

[13:08] <wafflus> https://pastebin.com/4hr3AggY

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh by the way, the "auto-abbreviate" feature apparently works as --o, not -o

[13:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know how you feel about that

[13:10] <wafflus> oh ok but -o seems to work?

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you do the "trick" I showed then yes

[13:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but not automatically

[13:11] <wafflus> i couldnt get any short options without using the trick anways

[13:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, I'm saying that you can shorten --options automatically, if you set it up

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but if that's not what you want then of course it's irrelevant

[13:12] <wafflus> well ideally it would be -long and -l but that probally does not work on linux?

[13:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> will take a look into it

[13:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> okay, that's doable

[13:16] <wafflus> wow cool

[13:16] <wafflus> i always thought why didnt they just use - for both long and short options

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> add my %*SUB-MAIN-OPTS = :!bundling;

[13:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> somewhere before MAIN I guess

[13:17] <wafflus> cool ty trying now

[13:22] <wafflus> it didnt work sorry

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what did you do, then?

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I tried it and it worked

[13:23] <wafflus> can you show me yoirs

[13:27] <wafflus> k ty isnt that the same one as before that relies on the trick?

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it works with -long and -l as well

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think that might work without Getopt::Long as well btw

[13:28] <wafflus> %*SUB-MAIN-OPTS = :!bundling; does not seem to do anything

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it does seem to do something, namely that you can write -long without being interpreted as -l -o -n -g

[13:29] <wafflus> oh ok

[13:31] <wafflus> k cool this is great

[13:34] <wafflus> think it all working i don't have to do the speical trick

[13:35] <wafflus> sorry i lied lol

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think you need to do that either way, unless there is a built-in option

[13:35] *** jgaz joined
[13:35] <wafflus> wont work unless i do :o(:$one)

[13:35] <wafflus> no biggie i'm sure i can remeber that

[13:36] <wafflus> btw what do you use to write rakue i'lm using code atm the lsp doesn't seem so great

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the RakuNavigator LSP is by far the best editor plugin what we have I think

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there are people who use Comma, I wouldn't know much about it but it's supposed to be good...

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I frankly just use near-default Vim or Cudatext usually, if not VSC

[13:38] <wafflus> i already got that extension installed I dont seem to get many auto complete¬† options

[13:39] <wafflus> i also have vim though i have nothing installed for that

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> auto-complete no

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> never seen any auto-complete, either Comma has it or nothing

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but hey, people say this is a "write-only language", who needs autocomplete for writing it

[13:40] <wafflus> lol

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the only instruction is to start typing, you will definitely get somewhere

[13:41] <wafflus> it kind of cool to do things like "apple". and get all the methods etc

[13:41] <wafflus> instead i have to do "ddd".^methods

[13:42] <wafflus> in a shell

[13:42] <wafflus> i think the tools let down raku

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it would be cool but 1. Raku didn't seem to attract the kind of people who care about this

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 2. the design kind of goes against that, too. The interfaces are very fat and nested

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you could easily get several dozens of methods

[13:43] <wafflus> yeah:( ¬†i mean look at things like the ruby shell and powersehll help system

[13:43] <wafflus> very noob freindly

[13:44] <wafflus> i mean if they actually fixed it to work on windows and auto installed linenoise or readline that would also help

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It's not easy to even recruit people who care

[13:47] <wafflus> i wish i has the skills to maybe help

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> couldn't say I care enough about Windows to try and tackle something with it, especially with this level of OS-specific knowledge

[13:48] <wafflus> k but even linux didnt just work out of the box

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it makes some sense that native (as in, C ABI) libs aren't installed, that's very platform-specific

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> even Linux distros handle it one by one, in an arbitrary way

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> idk if Terminal::LineEditor would install out of the box, that has the highest chance

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but even that depends on termios

[13:49] <wafflus> just raku seems to have more hoops to get things up and running even on linux

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't have much to compare

[13:51] <wafflus> for instance the shell ^A character when i tried to scroll up untill i installed readlione or linenoise

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Comma does have both autocomplete and automatic documentation. (The latter does not work for all symbols all the time; YMMV.)

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I guess that's excusable for somebody coming from Perl which has no REPL whatsoever

[13:53] <wafflus> k ty will try the comma out

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would also miss the REPL though, but it also doesn't seem to be... interesting enough? to get some help

[13:54] <wafflus> a repl that can scroll up out the box or delete things would be nice :)

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @wafflus There is also an Emacs major mode for Raku. It is not that good, in my opinion, so I do not use it. (And I want to use Emacs.)

[13:54] <wafflus> i;ve got emacs i found setting up emacs too much of a pain for lsp etc?

[13:54] <wafflus> !

[13:55] <wafflus> i've got a nice vim and code that works for most things

[13:55] <wafflus> also emacs seems slighty broken on windows as well

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Comma's REPL is great -- it would be nice its functionalities to be replicated outside of IntelliJ.

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> vim ü§Æ

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> also, vi ü§Æ

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Vim is the editor of engineers

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> also, python ü§Æü§Æü§Æ

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's surprising that there aren't more Emacs users in the Raku community

[13:57] <wafflus> vim was also a pain till i found someones config as a starting point

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Emacs is this typical idealist, "let's take up on everything" tool

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Emacs could probably be emulated in Emacs lol

[13:59] <wafflus> maybe emacs could emulate you as a special helper AI

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Welll, Emacs can emulate vi / vim.

[14:00] <wafflus> i think i have doom emacs mode or something like that

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @waffus This can be done easily as an LLM persona.

[14:01] <wafflus> I dunno would surly require too much computing power to emulate nemokosch's brain power?

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I've been blowing this trumpet for a long time that it's logical and all that everybody is a volunteer and therefore free to do whatever they want - but maybe some sacrifices should be made on the behalf of potential users...

[14:03] <wafflus> :D ¬†are there logs of this channel somewhere?

[14:03] <wafflus> \log

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-beginner

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again, LLMs can be the answer -- Nemokosch has left a lot or "written tracks" on his thought process. So, in should not be that hard to hijack LLMs computers to emulate generation of Nemokosch texts.

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Do you mean money or small virgin mammals ?

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to summarize the topic: if you keep complaining about lack of resources, "resources" being the very few involved developers, including you...

[14:05] <wafflus> i do like to use ai to ask programming related questions thought it does quite often give the wrong answer

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then maybe you should put more effort into getting and educating others to share this burden

[14:06] *** human-blip left
[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and if there were more people, each with their own unique challenges they want to address, maybe there could be an organic blending between UX concerns and developer effort

[14:06] *** human-blip joined
[14:08] <wafflus> restarting ty for all your help guys

[14:08] *** wafflus left
[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This might mean that you need to utilize proper prompt engineering. For popular programming languages the results are often good with OpenAI/ChatGPT. (No so much with PaLM/Bard, I think.)

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And those unique challenges do not seem to intersect much (in Raku land.) üôÇ

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Or Rakustan if you prefere... üôÇ )

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but they mostly don't seem to intersect with core developers' interest to share knowledge

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I honestly do not know about that. My own interests are much more in the "applications area", not so much in Raku's intramural world.

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's why you are fortunate

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you require little to no assistance because you don't need to know Raku more than a user

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ha! That is insightful. (Also, maybe, an insult attempt... ) üôÇ

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Meaning, you are implying I do not know Raku that much. üôÇ )

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have to say, I still do not think that much in Raku. My programming thinking in Raku is either within OOP as in the "old" C++, or within Functional programming as in LISP.

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> @antononcube What editor do you use to prepare your blog posts?

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you don't have to know Raku "that much"

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, all your complains about Raku not shedding the Perl legacy resonate with me.

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I use a Markdown editor (VS Code / Emacs / Comma / IntelliJ  / One Markdown) to write a Markdown file corresponding to the post. I execute the Markdown file using "Text::CodeProcessing". Then I copy the content of the obtained "women" Markdown file into WordPress post editor.

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If that I do not like the results of the WordPress interpretation of the Markdown, I generate the HTML version of the "woven" file, and paste that HTML code into the the "code editor" of WordPress.

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Nice setup.  You get very good results with it.

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To be honest, I am inclined to think that doing posts via WordPress is not that good both as a workflow and as posts' outlook. I really have to figure out how to use GitHub.io (or whatever) for blog posts, or something like Hugo (https://gohugo.io).

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For some posts, I start with a Jupyter notebook, and after finish writing and experimenting, I convert the notebook to Markdown.

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not like Jupyter that much -- editing with it feels like using vi ...

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, instead of Markdown, the posts can be written in Org-mode or Pod6, and then "woven" with "Text::CodeProcessing". I think I have demoed that processin in some video last year.

[14:35] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> If you are into Markdown, you might want to try Obsidian, which has various possibilities to publish more or less automatically (paid version build in or use some free tools to do it)

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, actually, I made the "Literate programming" demon in March this year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UjAdQaKof8

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, people have mentioned to Obsidian in relation to the package "Markdown::Grammar".

[14:45] *** ab5tract joined
[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I use Obsidian daily - drawback: nor explicit code highlighting for Raku as it uses CodeMirror6 for that which is missing a Language Pack for that. So I usually fall back to Perl to have some highlighting.

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Again, I have heard about CodeMirror6 before in Raku's forums, and followed the links. I think that convinced me that the editor Geany needs Raku mode/style. üôÇ

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> The people on https://replit.com/ seem to be fluent in making packages ... maybe at some point they will create also one for Raku.

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will investigate...

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz Do you use replit IDE on a regular basis? If yes, with which programming languages?

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I agree with the comments about the tooling for raku and the bias to unix vs. windows - but, I would also urge some fairness on the team. For comparison, here is what GitHub Insights shows for the last month of commit activity on (i) nodejs/node = 67 authors, (ii) python/cpython = 113 authors, (iii) rakudo/rakudo = 7 authors.

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Specifically on the Comma IDE, I think that it is great to see the massive effort and commitment to get a full IDE based on the very popular IntelliJ platform to the level that it is ... even thought there is not yet a real commercial opportunitiy to sell Comma Pro. (Of course this team will be in poll position to lead in the market if raku continues to grow and increase in popularity)

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Also the comments reflect that there is an explosion in cloud coding tools - glot.io, replit, etc etc and only when raku is in the top "20"? will it be something that those teams will want to spend effort to include

[15:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> same with apt-get and homebrew

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> No, I am not using it regularely. I was just testing it - if this is something I can use in teaching. Decided for Jupyter. But repl has Raku as one of the possible languages.

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Aggree. I had the feeling that all these Web-Based tools use just 2 or 3 "code editor frameworks" as foundation - so key would be to get Raku in these "code editors framworks" as supported language. I would donate for that: 50 Euro.

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I also use Brian Duggans Jupyter raku kernel ... I have it working in a Dockerfile but would prefer docker-compose .... has anyone got that working?  PS. on AWS you need a t3.small (payable) as the minium viable CPU speed

[15:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is the difference? üò¨

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I don't know - the last time I could get my docker-compose.yaml up ... it was only a simple wrapper on the docker image ... sooo I am hoping to steal from someone who already has it working!!

[16:21] <Manifest0> How can i save a function code or Code block given by the user, so i can execute it later on another run? I have a function that receives a function that i would like to save it for later. Example: sub save-function(&f) {spurt 'code.raku' &f }

[16:22] <Manifest0> is it possible to do something like this?

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> maybe RakuAST will allow this

[16:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> until that I suppose you need to carry strings around and EVAL them

[16:27] <Manifest0> how can i see the code of a function?
