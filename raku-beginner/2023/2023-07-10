[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> Hey, this example program raku enum AliasId <cha-prod cha-debug cha-bootl cha-prel ipg-debug ipg-release>;  sub MAIN(AliasId $alias) {   say $alias; }   returns the usage string, when invoked with the single argument "cha-prod" I would like to automatically check that the string argument is a valid AliasId, and have it converted to that type, is that possible?

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hello, I think there are issues with loading the symbols right on time; your mileage might even vary depending on the names you pick

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> ehm. Could you explain that in more detail?

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well... probably not. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> Ok, so in general, what can I do to make this, or something similar work reliably

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> ?

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> by the way, I just copied your code into a demo script and called it with cha-prod and that worked

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in fact, all of this worked for me

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> well. My script is a little bigger, I just extracted this. Also a module is loaded, but that shouldn't really impact things

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> That might very well impact things

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> really, I don't know how it works and why but I have stumbled upon issues with it myself

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for example, if there is a name collision with something coming from the core library (in my case that was the name Label) then it doesn't work

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> something that I did notice is that a module that I like to use for argument processing, Getopt::Long, fixes these issues for free

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5091 this might be your problem in some shape or form

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <knorrfg> Ok, I'll look into it. Thanks
