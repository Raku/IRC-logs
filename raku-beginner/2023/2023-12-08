[09:05] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Reading this discussion about RakuDoc and decorators in the advent calendar,  I am wondering if there is an option to get decorators attached to PRE and POST phasers of methods or subs - in a similar way the leading and tailing decorators can be fetched from methods/subs.  I am thinking in a similar way than MAIN is handled very conveniently â€¦ to e.g. enable auto generated ToolTips e.g. in Jupyter esp. in

[09:05] <discord-raku-bot> educational environment.

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> PS: this would be also my feedback: IF there is added value in providing standardized documentation to objects/methods/subs etc. (e.g. Editor support) THEN people consider making this extra effort.  Same as for MAIN.

[09:14] <lizmat> rcmlz please make a problem-solving issue for that: in RakuAST that should be pretty trIvial to implement

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @ab5tract I enjoyed your advent post, looking forward for how you tackle the slowdown issue ðŸ˜Š

[12:27] <ab5tract> thanks .vushu, glad you liked it! I'm not sure if I will get around to it this advent, but who knows :)

[14:15] <ab5tract> there will be a performance related post, but I've already let the cat out of the bag a bit. Did you already see https://5ab5traction5.bearblog.dev/an-initial-investigation-into-using-zig-to-speed-up-raku-code/?

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Ah yeah I have! I also suspected that you proably will use zig to speed things up, quite interesting ðŸ˜Š
