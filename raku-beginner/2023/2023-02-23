[09:06] <habere-et-disper> Thanks gfldex ! :D

[09:12] <habere-et-disper> When specifying a signature constraint with *where*, it seems that the constraint is restricted to being stated positively. With *if* we have *unless*. Is there an equivalent for *where* such as *whereas* ?

[09:13] <gfldex> no

[09:13] <habere-et-disper> Okay, thanks !
