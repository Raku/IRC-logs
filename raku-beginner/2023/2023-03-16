[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> hi how do i emulate perl's -0777? $*IN.slurp()?

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> my trials:

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita>  $ echo -n $'one\ntwo' | raku -ne'say "<$*IN.slurp()>"' <two> 

[06:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita>  $ echo -n $'one\ntwo' | perl -0777 -ne'CORE::say "<$_>"' <one two> 

[06:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> why the raku one skips "one"?

[06:50] <tea3po> sorry I dc'd

[06:50] <tea3po> anyway, in the first iteration you discard the read value, then read and print the rest of stdin  (I think)(

[06:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> thanks what can i do for preventing that

[06:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> manually add $_ from left? i guess there is a better way

[07:03] <tea3po>  $ echo -n $'one\ntwo' | raku -ne'say "<$*IN.slurp()>"'

[07:03] <tea3po> sorry I dc'd again, and that was a mispaste

[07:03] <tea3po>  $ echo -n $'one\ntwo' | raku -ne'say "<$_>"'   # I think this will work

[07:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> that goes line by line though

[07:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> aim is to treat what's coming as a single string

[07:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> like -0777 of perl

[07:11] <tea3po> then,  $ echo -n $'one\ntwo' | raku -e'say "<$*IN.slurp()>"'  #?

[07:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> thank you very much
