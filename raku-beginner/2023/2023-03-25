[22:47] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> How would I infinitely cycle a lazy sequence. That is, from <a b c d> to (a b c d a b c d ...)

[22:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: my @cycled = <a b c d>.Slip xx *; say @cycled[^20];

[22:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (a b c d a b c d a b c d a b c d a b c d) 

[22:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> seems to work

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> ah, clever
