[09:06] <ab5tract> .vushu installed the new raylib bindings. I think some signatures changed that weren’t supposed to.. `load-codepoints` worked fine before (at least, it didn’t explode and returned output), but I can’t figure out how to use it now (trouble creating Pointer[int32] objects). I can’t help but thinking that at least some of those pointers should really be CArray

[09:07] <ab5tract> Good news that it installed just fine on macOS! :D

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> <ab5tract> good to know that it works on macos :), I will try to play around with the int pointers.

[09:41] <ab5tract> here’s an example.. right now it’s broken but if you comment out the char point stuff and switch `image-text-ex` to `image-text`, it’s a working snowfall simulator

[09:49] * lizmat smiles at (0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4)>>.Num

[09:49] * lizmat is looking forward to a screen shot of the result

[10:03] <ab5tract> I think it’s technically fewer characters than adding `e0` to each number ;)

[10:14] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> thanks <ab5tract> I will try it out 🙂

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> i think I know whats wrong

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> the load code point is missing is rw

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> for Pointer[int32]

[14:06] *** jtza8 left
[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> nvm it didn't solve it :d

[15:07] <ab5tract> Is it also broken with CArray?

[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I think using pointers in raku isn't ergonomic this is how I got it working   my $buf = Buf[int32].new(0); my $one-pointer = nativecast(Pointer[int32], $buf); my $text = "asdfsadfadsf"; my $code-point-a = load-codepoints($text, $one-pointer);  say $one-pointer.deref; # 12 which is correct 

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> btw it's nice the your blizzard simulator 🙂

[16:22] <ab5tract> thanks! I’ve made a few tweaks since then, will probably make a few more.

[16:36] <ab5tract> .vushu I may be wrong but I believe you could also change back from `Pointer[int32]`  to `int32 is rw`

[16:42] <ab5tract> At least in this case, for `load-codepoints`. For `load-font-ex` I think the answer is `CArray` (but I will shut up about that now :) )

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> haha it’s fine I will play around with it and verify if thats the case 😅

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Turns out that I wasn't handling pointer return types properly Please update raylib-raku to version 0.0.11  my $buf = Buf[int32].new(0 xx 1); my $count = nativecast(Pointer[int32], $buf); my $text = "Ab5tract"; my Pointer[int32] $point = load-codepoints($text, $count);  say $count.deref; # shows 8   my $snow-a = load-font-ex("resources/DotGothic16-Regular.ttf", 48, $point, $count.deref);  

[21:41] *** habere-et-disper left
[22:23] <ab5tract> Cool! I will check this out :D

[22:24] <ab5tract> I’m about 2/3 of the way through implementing Tetris

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> thats so cool 😄

[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> please showcase the game when you are done 😁

[23:22] <ab5tract> For sure. Was planning to PR it to raylib-raku as an example

[23:23] <ab5tract> likewise with the snowfall sim
