[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail>  my $iwctlproc = run 'iwctl station wlan0 show', :out; my $iwctlout = $iwctlproc.out.slurp: :close; say $iwctlout;  I want a program that will get my current wifi network name. this should print the output of iwctl station wlan0 show, which contains the info I want, but instead it prints nothing. What might be wrong here?

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is no program called 'iwctl station wlan0 show'

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you no what I mean

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> probably need to send arguments to run separately

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i'm not exactly sure why

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you are going to hardcode the whole shell input, you might use the qx[] quoting

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which runs a shell and returns the output

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Huh. yeah that did work

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> interesting

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> thanks

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> run executes a program without invoking a complete shell, shell invokes a complete shell, and so does qx// but it fetches the output, much like $() or the backticks would in Shell

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this also means the latter two take like a line of shell, while the former takes a list of arguments, starting with the program to execute

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Oh well you can just use run with the full command in <>, that's convenient
