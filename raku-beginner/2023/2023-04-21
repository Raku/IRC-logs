[01:31] <shmup> that was insufferable.

[01:37] <shmup> Teressa very inappropritely targetted Nemokosch who did nothing so harmfully "psasive aggressive", creating a whole Mood in here, only to again get him an "official warning". it's kinda lol if anyone just reads scrollback with any criticial reading

[01:37] <shmup> that's all ~ carry on cheerio

[01:38] <falsifian> I've been reading the scrollback from 08:30 UTC and am really confused.

[01:39] <shmup> lol

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> What's the story with int32 -- I can't find it in the docs?

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> > (int32).WHAT

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> (int32)

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> > int32.^methods

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> No such method 'methods' for invocant of type

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> 'Perl6::Metamodel::NativeHOW'

[09:29] <habere-et-disper>   in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> > my int32 $foo;

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> 0

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> > say $foo;

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> Bytecode validation error at offset 170, instruction 24:

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> operand type 32 does not match register type 24 for op getlex_ni in frame <unit>

[09:30] <lizmat> the last one is an artefact of the REPL

[09:30] <lizmat> m: my int32 $foo; say $foo

[09:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 62d263fcc: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[09:30] <lizmat> also: if you do that in the REPL on a single line, it'll work

[09:30] <habere-et-disper> Yeah -- I noticed that!

[09:30] <lizmat> also: native ints aren't really objects, they just pretend to be

[09:31] <lizmat> m: int32.^methods

[09:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 62d263fcc: OUTPUT: «No such method 'methods' for invocant of type␤'Perl6::Metamodel::NativeHOW'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:31] <lizmat> I'd say that's an LTA error

[09:32] <lizmat> there should probably be an issue of that if there isn't already

[09:36] <habere-et-disper> The first row on my keyboard switches on and off sometimes, so I often get to see the suggestions from typos. The only typo that seemed missing was a suggestion for 'say' from 'sa'.

[16:48] <rcmlz> I am trying to estimate the effort of implementing syntax-highlighting for Raku in Prism. Prism is used in e.g. Obsidian. There is a Perl-definition as starting point. https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/blob/master/components/prism-perl.js - 156 lines of JS code. Reading it I sort of understand the definition for Perl. Would this same definition work

[16:48] <rcmlz> more or less also for Raku? Is there a way to generate the input for the line 150 "keyword" automatically, as I suspect that there a quite a few new keywords in Raku compared to Perl? Thank you for your thoughts.
