[00:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> hey I'm struggling with something

[00:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> this won't work

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> class IsEven {     has $.num;      method CheckEven {          if ($.num % 2 = 0) {say 'Is Even';}         else {say 'Is Odd';}     } }

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> keep getting "Cannot modify immutable Int"

[00:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> what bit of logic am I missing here?

[00:29] *** Manifest0 left
[01:16] <rf> it should be == 0

[01:16] <rf> not = 2 @Yeuph

[01:16] <rf> not = 0**

[01:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> yeah...

[01:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I forgot this beams into the other text channel

[01:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I humiliatedly deleted my text hoping no one had seen it after I saw it lol

[01:18] <rf> Also for the first part, I'm fairly certain that doesn't work :)

[01:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> lol

[01:18] <rf> Well, not as you think it works

[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I arrived there after 30 minutes of trying to figure out why my program wouldn't work

[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> and no, that doesn't work either lol

[01:19] <rf> m: say %(5, 2);

[01:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 83caae8ea: OUTPUT: ¬´{5 => 2}‚ê§¬ª

[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> ya, looks like some functional thing

[01:20] <rf> It's actually a map.

[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> When I tried that I did get the program to work

[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> except not how I wanted to

[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> so I came in here asking what was going on because that didn't make sense to me either

[01:21] <rf> %(n, m) should always be truthy so it would always hit the truthy block

[01:21] <rf> m: say %(5, 2)<5>;

[01:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 83caae8ea: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[01:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> Thanks for chiming in.  I'm gonna get back to my book.  All of humanity was just killed, very exciting.  I guess I'm rooting for the spiders now (Children of Time)

[01:23] <rf> Haha, enjoy!

[07:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> AlexDaniel mocked it üò©

[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> is a class object just an instance of the class itself

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl class C {} say C.WHAT; 

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (C) 

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> the class of class C is C itself

[08:19] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> mind blown

[09:00] <lizmat> yes

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> the reason why class methods are not separated from instance methods is because classes are just instances of itself

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> so instance methods are applicable to class

[09:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in Python land: "static method" = sub inside of class, "class method" = method invoked on a class instance, "object method" (does it even have a name) = method invoked on a concrete instance

[09:18] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> object method is called instance method in python (and most otger languages as well)

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> the class isn't even responsible for creating instances unlike python and ruby the metaobject is

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a class corresponds to a metaobject, for what it's worth

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one could say that the class is the syntactic representation while the metaobject is the (runtime) behavior

[09:30] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> meanwhile in python the class is the metaobject lol

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's a blessing and a curse at the same time

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> more stable APIs -> safer and easier to work with BUT more burden on the implementations, therefore one needs to give up on own speed

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Is there a way to turn a junction into a list? I saw iterator, but that seems too complicated

[19:21] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think "officially" there isn't, de facto it's possible
