[06:14] <CIAvash> habere-et-disper: Not sure, The only think I can think of is not using `chroma.Coalesce` in your `go` code and adding a CSS style such as `span.o::after { content: 'â€Œ'; }`(the content is a ZWJ).

[06:15] <CIAvash> Chroma supports Terminal, JSON, SVG and HTML formats. But you can write your own formatter.
