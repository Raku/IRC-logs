[10:32] <ab5tract> vushu: Good news! With some very minor tweaks I was able to compile and run raylib-raku on macOS :D

[11:54] <ab5tract> vushu: A small note — you might explore changing parameter-less function definitions to be term definitions instead. This allows you to then write `while !window-should-close {` or `get-time` without any parentheses because the term by its nature will not have any arguments

[15:28] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> <ab5tract> good to know :), thanks for the tip I will see if can incorparate those things.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Cross-posting here because for some reason it was ignored yesterday in the “main” IRC channel. (Because certain sites were down or not working or something.)

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Where I can see example of distribution dependent Raku module tests? For example, I want to run one set of tests on macOS and a different set (maybe empty) on Linux.

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Here it is suggestet to use "skip" - https://docs.raku.org/type/Test#sub_skip to exclude single (sub) tests, or maybe plain-vanilla KISS like this?    use Test; plan 1;  if $*DISTRO.is-win {   ok True, "Windows-Tests"; }elsif $*DISTRO.name ~~ /macos/ {   ok True, "MacOS-Tests"; }else{   ok True, "Linux-Tests"; }  done-testing 

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m:  use Test; plan 1;  if $DISTRO.is-win {   ok True, "Windows-Tests"; }elsif $DISTRO.name ~~ /macos/ {   ok True, "MacOS-Tests"; }else{   ok True, "Linux-Tests"; } done-testing

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  1..1 ok 1 - Linux-Tests 

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thank you1

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz And yes I was going to do the "plain vanilla" approach. But I was wondering is there are more streamlined way of doing it.

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Or do OS-specific test files starting with e.g. for MacOS   use Test; plan 1;  unless $*DISTRO.name ~~ /macos/ {     skip-rest "Skipping MacOS specific tests";     exit; }  ok True, "MacOS-Tests"; done-testing
