[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> finally finished this https://raku.guide/

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i understood a lot and nothing at the same time XD

[00:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> It is fine -- you know more that before reading it.

[02:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> true

[02:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> btw does raku have jobs or is it still too early for that?

[02:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> and if not can it at least build applications ? like small to medium size tools for companies or webstes

[02:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> also does it have a gui built in or modules for gui or something to build apps?

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes. There are examples here : https://cro.services . There are other efforts, like "Humming-Bird".

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am not sure what kind of jobs you are referring to. Do people get hired for working with Raku? Or, can Raku have, say, cron jobs?

[08:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I would assume the former

[08:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> In which case: I don't really know about Raku developer title - there is even a Problem solving issue for the lack of this concept in LinkedIn

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what one can do is to mix the use of Raku into daily tasks

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is what I also do

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I do not know, but check out these modules: https://raku.land/tags/gui .

[11:14] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> How does this work for you? This is something I'd love to do, however working in primarily a .NET & Windows environment, with a team who rarely leave the ecosystem. Perhaps I could use it for personal scripts/applications. Ideally I'll move away from .NET jobs in the future.

[11:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well I'm mostly working in a Unix environment and whatever script I can make useful is a net win

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mess around a lot with git CLI and text processing, gluing stuff together

[11:18] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> That sounds interesting, what % of $day-job code would you say is in Raku?

[11:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's hard to say because you don't press "save" for something that was meant to select a couple of commits for you

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> raku -ne 'my $commit-message = qqx[git show --name-only $_ | iconv -c]; say $commit-message if $commit-message.contains("ighlight.c")'

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Gotcha, so literally using it for oneliners

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is not something for the future generations but if it saves me time collecting commits that affected certain files, it's a net win

[11:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I have like 3 or 4 scripts, usually still in the 50 to 100 lines territory, that I did upload to our internal git

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh mostly so that I can say "see, this is what I made and what I use"

[11:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and also one tool that is actually being developed, for gathering data from Jira (Zephyr, to be accurate) and making it into test report HTML files

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> to be honest, this is the practical reason I started with Raku in the first place, and this part never failed me

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Very cool, I'd not really considered Raku for something like that, however due to it's history I guess it makes total sense.

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Feel like Python would be the more common choice these days

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The thing is with Python, for 2 lines of what I actually want, you'd need like 5 lines of boilerplate. Something from sys, something else from os, re, subprocess...

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> more imports than lines, with their rigid APIs. It's a waste.

[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Yeah that makes sense actually. When I've used Python I've noticed a lot of that. Does Raku rarely require any imports (use)?

[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Python was meant to be kind of a standalone purist language I guess, Raku carries some of the oldschool Perl pragmatism when it comes to gluing stuff together

[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and Raku has a huge core; "secretly" even a JSON parser and emitter is included

[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be a joke to need to include something for regular expressions, that's like the foundation of the language...

[11:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> (having said that, sheer regex performance could be better... or could it)

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Hahah, surely it's on par with Perl though?

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Pretty sure it isn't...

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wonder if that's technological overhead or just bad algorithms

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The thing is, you don't just randomly bump into somebody who can design an efficient regex engine

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Hahah unfortunately not, I imagine it's probably very complicated

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Anyway, since I rarely do things were mere throughput would matter a lot, it's not really my problem

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The people who need performance might outsource the bottleneck part to some efficient native code and call into that with NativeCall

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's always an "easy way out"

[11:55] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Yeah, I guess regex isn't always gonna' be super performant. My boss from previous job would seriously discourage us from writing regex at all because he was so overly conscious about performance, he went too far with it.

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Maybe regex in C# is extremely slow, I think he was just paranoid though

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yeah I would be surprised if the .NET platform was that bad in this regard, with 20 years of mainstream enterprise use and all that Microsoft wisdom

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> He never really updated his programming knowledge since around 2000 so maybe things were different then

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I guess around 2000 it was much more Perl eccentricity (apart from the useless dumb regexes)

[12:04] *** ab5tract joined
[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Yeah that's about right.

[12:08] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> I might see if I can use Raku at current job for similar purposes, unfortunately it feels a bit more like a second class citizen in Windows and I might have to get permission to install it.

[12:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Maybe GPT-5 or -8 can help with that.

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm sure you already have a chatgptforprediction site

[12:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> 🙂 No, I "against" ChatGPT-like models.

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> But because I follow my "informed hate" principle, I tend to know or have experience dealing with them.

[12:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> BTW, this what happened with some of the earlier AI programs -- they simplified VLSI designs. (Earlier, meaning, 35-40 years ago, and LISP.)

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> nice principal XD

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and what happened to Python is that you made a wordpress for it

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 🧠

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Damn! I forgot about that...

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Hmmm... I need to post something there soon...

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> On the Raku jobs : 1) I do get occasionally hired to do Raku projects because of my DSLs work. 2) But I mostly use my Raku DSL packages to speed up my "typical" data scientist work.

[12:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> In some sense, I have two secret weapons (when compared to other data scientists) : 1) Mathematica / WL, and 2) Raku.

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> What edge does Raku give you over Python? I figure that's also the dominant language for data science.

[12:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Python is a "stupid language" -- both a selling point, and a limitation. It is only "good" for established Machine Learning (ML) workflows.

[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> In my experience, most ML engineers or data scientists are Python users,  not  Python programmers.

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I have been proclaiming or explaining my Python views in this forum before. I do not want bother everyone with those again... 🙂

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> ( @Nemokosch  That is why pythonforprediction is needed! )

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Stupid language in what sense?

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> 🙂 Do you mind if I respond with a reference?

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Go for it

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> where do i find it?

[12:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> You can search the raku-beginner and/or raku and/or language channels. Or see the link I posted above.

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) — also known as Shitty Agile For Enterprises,

[12:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> 🙂 Yeah, I heard it -- I think -- in a panel Q&A session with the creators of the Agile methodology.

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> well saying there is only one way to solve a problem is interesting

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i do not agree with that from a physical world standpoint

[12:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i like how you pointed out that they are easily replaceable due to that concept

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i have a question but its quite general

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> in oop if i have like 100 classes file ( do i really need to make 1 file per class also) how do the files communicate with each other? does it implicitely export and export each file to each other ?

[14:19] <lizmat> if you need exporting of these classes to each other, then you're probably better off having it in a single file

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> they could live in the same package, couldn't they?

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> package as in module in other languages right?

[14:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> or is it close to library ? sorry the terms are currently confusing me

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not only you, chill

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> package as in, well, namespace

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> more words XD

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i know how namespaces work in c basically it adds std:: to everything

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> joke i know its more than that but its my personal trama from c and c++ XD

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> anw how do those relate ?

[14:32] <lizmat> a package is a namespace

[14:33] <lizmat> a class is a special case of a package, as are role, grammar, module

[14:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> wow lizmat thank you

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> btw is this a general case lizmat or specific to c ?

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> dammit, I still don't know how this actually works

[14:47] <lizmat> that's the way it works in Raku  :-)

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> well it kinda makes it more annoying when multiple languages treat this differently XD

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it was about Raku

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> C itself didn't have namespaces

[14:47] <lizmat> it could be more general

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> oh thank you lizmat

[14:47] <lizmat> Perl appears to be adopting some of these idioms

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> so chatgpt disagrees but probably it is basing the answer on other languages

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1095721947100348477/image.png

[14:48] <lizmat> that answer is contradicting itself 

[14:48] <lizmat> or maybe not  

[14:49] <lizmat> in general, you won't see many bare "package" statements in Raku

[14:49] <lizmat> you will see a lot of class / role / module ones, and a few grammar ones

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1095722415595716698/image.png

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> from what I heard, they are adding packages to C++ but yeah, that won't be the same as a namespace

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or do they call it module? 🤪

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1095722624761462925/image.png

[14:50] <lizmat> re scopes: just about everything in Raku is lexically scoped

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> so it seems they are the same but it might be politically incorrect to say it XD

[14:50] <lizmat> one exception: dynamically scoped variables

[14:51] <lizmat> which have the * twigil, like $*IN

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but like, even lexical scopes can be inspected from distance, lol

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> so what i noticed is

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> good old CALLER::

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> it seems that marketing played a very large role in naming

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> for example java methods vs function vs subrootine

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> all 3 are the same

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> just they want to name them differently for a specific language XD

[14:53] <lizmat> well, in Raku in the end, it's all just blocks of code being executed

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> ❤️

[14:53] <lizmat> but they can be wrapped in a sub, or a method, or a private method, or a submethod, or a whatevercode

[14:53] <lizmat> or just a (pointy) block

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure how much this is a beginner question but it's a fundamental question at least...

[14:54] *** Aozen joined
[14:55] *** Aozen left
[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> as a beginner i have no idea what a beginner question is XD

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> i just ask and see if i get an answer and if none answer not much i can do about it

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if there is a META6 file, can modules still be found using the logic of the filesystem compunit repository?

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if the META6 file doesn't clarify what it provides or something

[14:56] <lizmat> yeah, use -Ilib rather than -I.

[14:56] <lizmat> then it won't see the META6.json file

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm... eventually where I'm getting at is, is it okay to do some "use lib" stuff for internal use within the source code itself?

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there is a sufficiently big size where one probably wouldn't want a monolithic file

[14:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for things that aren't necessarily to be "provided"

[15:00] <lizmat> the test-suite is partly dependent on that, so I guess that's a yes...   but you can't have precompilation then

[15:00] <lizmat> 'use lib' cannot be pre-compiled and thus cannot be used in a module'

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ouch

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no precompilation to the rescue but this is kinda pricey
