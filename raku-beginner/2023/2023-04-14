[08:12] <habere-et-disper> Can/should I add a method to a subset? I tried:

[08:12] <habere-et-disper> m: subset Even of Int where * %% 2; Even.^add_method('double', method ($n:) { 2 * $n });

[08:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3fb68b354: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'add_method' for invocant of type‚ê§'Perl6::Metamodel::SubsetHOW'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm pretty sure you can take that as a no

[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a subset is not a new standalone type

[08:26] <habere-et-disper> Thanks for clarifying. :)

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what you can do is to add a candidate that is constrained to this type

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perhaps it even works on the self parameter

[08:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but then augmenting something built-in is generally disadvised
