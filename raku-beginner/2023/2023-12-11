[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hello Raj, I think https://course.raku.org/ can be good for starting

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also https://raku.guide/

[20:10] <mcmillhj> If I have `Point` class is there a method I can override to provide the correct logic for how `Point`s should be ordered during `.sort`?

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm afraid you will have to pass a callback to sort itself

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the reason is that the cmp operator is resolved insufficiently, only from core

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in theory, it would be that operator that you could overload

[20:16] <mcmillhj> oh okay, bummer. Thank you

[20:19] <mcmillhj> I'll override cmp though, that seems better than doing it manually in the sort callback

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah you can still pass that as the sorting function

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you can even try without passing it, in case this got fixed

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but I vaguely recall that PR never got merged

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> of course there is a pretty big overhead when doing caller-side symbol resolution - even if that's the right thing in my opinion, and there is a reason somebody made a PR with that

[20:24] <mcmillhj> it seems to just work after I overloaded the operator. I am on v2023.11 of Rakudo

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> interesting https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4484

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> lizmat: did something change here recently?

[22:05] <lizmat> the only thing changing with .sort was the addition of the :k argument

[22:37] <mcmillhj> I can post a paste if you are curious but it seems to work fine. Possibly I did something not expected though?

[22:42] <mcmillhj> oh wow, this is not working and I only discovered it while making the paste. I am not sure how my AOC result was correct then. My Point class has a `Str` method and that appears to be what sort is using.

[22:44] <mcmillhj> paste if you are curious https://topaz.github.io/paste/#XQAAAQAhAgAAAAAAAAAxmwhIY/VA5JAWSxIYw46zXL8unRJB3O1MhzwOvS14QHeU8CLKmjGArpynG6elR7Gd07FQc/oRCYnNrUIb06yWzFwCfExnoYxkNVNIjrVYQGF4TdVFZL2vjIvfIAzLlLt8G1SfScDQpTIYxVoTIjasDpaiND4ni5qaJ59wa7HON8N63L6jT/JKSVFPM8TBrTquXU7qeL3noyLSVK6LJ5iJAMk+9lVaVHvmD/ozmnZq0zYdNqO6l6hVzqvxL6ptiohOy3PjwF01uXWmWaKp/h
