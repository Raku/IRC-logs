[02:34] <thowe> in Raku regex, how do you match NOT a character.  Like, NOT 'a'?  Wouldn't it be something like !a?

[02:35] <thowe> I'm trying to match "a string of any characters that doesn't include a tab".

[02:40] <thowe> I came up with <-[\t]>+   is that right?  seems to work.

[08:00] <habere-et-disper> Hello Rackoons ! o/\o

[08:00] <habere-et-disper> What's are some other ways of saying `[==] @array` ?

[08:01] <habere-et-disper> I feel like I want to say `@array.all ...` but get stuck.

[08:02] *** dakkar joined
[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Probably not

[08:06] <habere-et-disper> Okay -- thanks.

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> There could be something like, "is the number of unique values 1" but i don't think that's better than the reduction

[08:08] <habere-et-disper> Thanks -- I forget about `unique`, like I do `first`.

[08:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> With all, what about @array.head == @array.skip.all

[08:10] <habere-et-disper> Clever, but you're right that the intent is getting lost.

[08:11] <habere-et-disper> One other one... here I'm looking for patterns of 2 of a kind together with 3 of a kind in a dice roll: `[5,5,4,5,4].Bag.values.sort ~~ (2,3)`. Does that look iffy ?

[08:13] *** teatwo joined
[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It would be nice imo to get away without the sort

[08:15] <habere-et-disper> That's what I was aiming for too.

[08:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: [5,5,4,5,4].Bag.values ~~ Set(2,3) andthen .say

[08:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[08:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> worth a try

[08:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Yeah, this seems okay. But then at this point actually we might as well just use (==)

[08:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: [5,5,4,5,4].Bag.values (==) (2,3) andthen .say

[08:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> m: [5,5,4,5,4].Bag.values.contains( 2 & 3)

[08:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6f84b209: ( no output )

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> m: [5,5,4,5,4].Bag.values.contains( 2 & 3).say

[08:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6f84b209: OUTPUT: ¬´all(True, True)‚ê§¬ª

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> uh oh, I think contains is the wrong one

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, this works on a string

[08:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: (1 xx 12).Bag.values.contains( 2).say

[08:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[08:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but anyway, this would only be the (<=) direction of the check

[08:44] <habere-et-disper> Right. So why not grep :

[08:44] <habere-et-disper> m: [1,1,2,1,2].Bag.values.grep( 2 & 3 ).so.say

[08:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6f84b209: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> contains (besides being a string search) acts on individual values

[08:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> grep, however, is a matcher kind of function; it doesn't distribute over the junction

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> now good luck finding a value that matches to 2 & 3 üòÑ

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: [1,1,2,1,2].Bag.values.grep( 2 | 3 ).so.say

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "is there at least one value that is either 2 or 3"

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not too useful or readable

[08:49] <habere-et-disper> I understand now. Thank you for explaining. (y)
