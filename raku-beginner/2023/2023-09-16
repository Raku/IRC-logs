[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> Yesterday on spanish raku forum someone was asking the following: how replicate the g switch when i want to do something between match and match, (for example here he is pushing the match of everything was after a '=' until a '&' or end of line). So i was thinking and get no (easy and elegant XOR satisfactory) answer for that.   while ($url =~ /=(.+?)(?:&|$)/g) {     push @parametros, $1; }  In the end we get

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> the conclution of 'c' switch kinda do the job, but the problem is generates extra Nil.

[16:59] <lizmat> ionsolo: that's the first time I've heard of a Spanish Raku forum: url ?

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> is a telegram channel of perl and raku, still you want the url ?

[16:59] <lizmat> ah, if it is a mingled channel, I'm less interested :-)

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> yeahh i thinked that, lol

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> and yes will be cool if there exists a spanish raku forum but we are so little üò¶

[17:09] <lizmat> on IRC, the code is really hard to read...  could you make a gist?

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> yes, wait a sec

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> https://gist.github.com/Ionsolo/5e38ce093739e6e3a77e23e176461579

[17:39] <lizmat> ionsolo:  =~   ??   don't you mean ~~ ??

[17:39] <lizmat> ah ok, "perl" code  :-)

[17:43] <lizmat> m: say "foo&bar" ~~ / <-[ & $ ]>+ /    # does that give an idea ?

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 40a94e23e: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢fooÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[17:44] <lizmat> <-[ & $ ]>  is a character class of all possible characters *except* & and $

[17:46] <lizmat> ionsolo ^^

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> ohh i don't get the notification, sorry.

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> yes it's "perl code" lol, need to translate to raku code

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> for example if you had an url like "site.com/year=2023&data=112" you will get 2023 and 112, the tricky part comes when this user wants to do use the matches as something to loop  like for ("aaa" ~ m:g/a/) {...}  an expects that the thing inside brackets run three times AND between every match (for example get the firts "a", do the code, next get the second "a", do the code), i don't get if we have some raku

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> construct that does that, because i came with this weird idea of using the match method .postmatch to do the loop, but also i think is awful idea

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> also i have the doubt if use a character class where new line class is inside, i remember that someone says that characters class can do set (in the math sense, not the raku class sense) operations, idk, to me, it looks like a bad idea, I will split in lines every url, process with map, and delete that thing of the newline or "&" of the regexp.

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: .&dd for 'aaa'.match(/a/):g

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Match.new(:orig("aaa"), :from(0), :pos(1)) Match.new(:orig("aaa"), :from(1), :pos(2)) Match.new(:orig("aaa"), :from(2), :pos(3)) 

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> looks good to me

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> Ok, let me try

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> what is .&dd ?

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the same as dd($_)

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> ohh the dumper function

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> yes it works !!!

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> thanks @nemokosch, great see you still here :3

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> üòÑ

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> for the record i have to use the old doc to get it, result that if you search "dd" in the new docs don't have the reference  here under the reference section in search bar https://rakudocs.github.io/  here using a global google search, kinda get the same https://docs.raku.org/

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> idk I fear that was the dd comand from the bash

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wouldn't bet my life that rakudocs.github.io is still maintained in any way

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it does show up in the new site as well, except the link is so obscure that you need to be deliberately looking for it

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1152729967176720475/image.png

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's semi-documented, let's say

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> yeah it's more like a freezed documentation from one year or so, but raku hasn't changed to much or so?

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Raku hasn't changed too much for sure (some stuff did get added in the meantime nevertheless) but the content has changed enough that eventually you will miss out something that has been filled since

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <ionsolo> ohh that's enough i guess to read more often the new documentation, i usually think that the latest changes are internal
