[00:10] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> I think the "Regexes" page covers most syntax you're likely to see

[00:10] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> yeah, I see several mentions of <{code}> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Regex_interpolation

[08:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - just like the perlre doc page in the old days, I keep https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes handy (but I wonder why the Fundamental topics like this are so low down on docs.raku.org

[09:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's in alphabetic order

[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on the desktop page there are two columns:

[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's essentially one column cut into half

[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the left column is (i) at the beginning (4 items) (ii) migration guides (~10 items), (iii) Tutorials (~20 items), (v) Fundamental Topics (~30 items)

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the right column is (i) General reference (~10 items) and (ii) Experimental features (1 item)

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so ~64 items on the left and 11 on the right is not exactly cut in half

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and the result is that the item in question Regex topic is about 50 items down on the left

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know how it shows up for you; for me it's roughly the same amount on both sides

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> "fundamental topics" being cut right under "functions"

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh I made the mistake of using safari

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is how all live versions appear, from the production site to finanalyst's preview

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> much better with chrome

[09:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i'll raise as an issue on docs then

[09:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx!
