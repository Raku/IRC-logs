[00:26] <deoac> Can a Raku program determine whether it was started from the command line vs. a cronjob?

[00:45] <rf> I think you can check if you're in a TTY

[00:47] <tea3po> say $*IN.t ?? "Input comes from tty." !! "Input doesn't come from tty.";

[00:49] <tea3po> idk how to detect if something is running under cron specifically

[00:50] <rf> you could set an env variable in your cron script

[00:50] <rf> IS_CRON=yes raku myscript.raku

[00:52] <habere-et-disper> $*USER might be CRON ?

[00:54] <tea3po> I imagine it would be root for system crontab, the user for user crontabs.

[00:55] <deoac> Thanks all.  I'll check both $*IN and $*USER.

[00:56] *** Manifest0 left
[00:58] <deoac> $*USER is my username when run as a cronjob.

[04:48] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Anyone know how to check if a class exists in the given namespace?

[04:51] *** tea3po is now known as TEATIME

[05:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> NS::{$class-name}:exists maybe

[05:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> if it's a my-scoped class it won't be seen though

[05:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> with this code

[05:41] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> did not work... says exists is not set

[05:42] *** TEATIME is now known as teatime2

[05:42] *** teatime2 is now known as teatime

[05:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> m: module NS {     class A {}     class B {} }  for ("A", "B", "D") -> $class-name {     ($class-name, NS::{$class-name}:exists).say } 

[05:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (A True) (B True) (D False) 

[05:49] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I import a module  use MIDI::Make;  And then I want to test if the File class from that module was made available.

[05:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> in "Make.rakumod", what do you have?

[05:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> like do you have "unit module Make;" (or "module Make { ... })

[05:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> and "class File" only

[05:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> or "class File is export"

[05:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> if it's like  module Make {     class File { } } (or with "unit module Make;")  then in the file that's "use"ing this, Make::<File>::exists says True

[06:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> but if it's "my"-scoped (the class) and only "is export", then ::<File>:exists can tell whether it's imported to the current space

[06:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> if it's both "our"-scoped (i.e., the default) and "is export", then both of them can tell

[06:02] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Yes, Make.rakumod  with unit module make

[06:02] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> class File is export(:shortnames) {}

[06:03] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> thanks!

[06:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> no problem

[16:12] <Sussysham> hi

[16:12] <lizmat> Sussysham o/

[16:13] <Sussysham> lizmat Greetings senpai

[16:13] <Sussysham> I mean senior

[16:13] <lizmat> domo arigato

[16:14] <lizmat> if you go by years, I guess you can call me a senior  :-)

[16:15] <lizmat> but I'd rather like to think of the "teacher" connotation :-)

[16:15] <Sussysham> I will also prefer that

[16:15] <Sussysham> can you help me  with setup?

[16:19] <lizmat> of Comma?  no, I'm afraid I'm a vim person

[16:20] <Sussysham> https://youtu.be/zDP9uUMYrvs intersting

[16:20] <Sussysham> lizmat No worries sensei I will figure something out

[16:21] <Sussysham> btw nxadm seems  ofline  username doesn't show up on @

[16:21] *** Sussysham left

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Does anyone know what the api key refers to  in the META6.json file?

[16:50] *** Sussysham joined
[16:51] <Sussysham> lizmat

[16:52] <lizmat> pelevesque the api key means what you want it to mean:

[16:52] <lizmat> it provides a way for users to specify which API version they want when installing / loading a module

[16:52] <lizmat> by default it is 0 afaik

[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> By that API refers to the module itself, or the API or Raku? If for the module, isn't the version number enough to know what is implemented?

[17:02] <lizmat> the API of the module itself

[17:02] <lizmat> it's up to the module author what that actually means

[17:02] <lizmat> use Foo:api<2>;

[17:02] <lizmat> would load the Foo module with api 2 (if installed of course)

[17:02] <lizmat> zef install 'Foo:api<2>'

[17:03] <lizmat> would install the highest version Foo module with api 2 (if such a thing exists, of course)

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Is it required?

[17:04] <dakkar> pelevesque: if the author is doing the whole semver thing, api and the major version would be more-or-less the same

[17:04] <dakkar> and no, it's not required

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> OK thanks. Ya, I am using semsev 2. I will drop my API key.

[17:05] *** Sussysham left
[17:05] <dakkar> keep in mind that there's no simple way for code to ask "give me the latest version that's >= 2.0.0 and < 3.0.0"

[17:05] <dakkar> but there is a simple way to ask "give me the latest version that's api==2"

[17:06] <dakkar> so if you think you will have a version 2.0.0, 3.0.0, &c, you may want to start with `api=>1`

[17:06] <dakkar> if you end up not needing it, no harm done

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> doesn't e.g 2.* give you the latest version?

[17:09] <dakkar> I'm not sure

[17:10] <lizmat> if you aren't specific, it will give you the highest version, regardless of api

[17:11] *** Sussysham joined
[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is this true for all patterns?

[17:13] <dakkar> lizmat: where's the documentation for `use` with a longname? none of https://docs.raku.org/language/module-packages.html https://docs.raku.org/language/modules.html https://docs.raku.org/language/compilation.html

[17:14] <lizmat> please make a doc issue for it  :-)

[17:14] <Sussysham> Will i have setup rakudo or raku first to use Comma ide

[17:14] <dakkar> rakudo is the implementation, raku is the language

[17:14] <Sussysham> What SDK it is asking for?

[17:15] <dakkar> (like CPython and Python)

[17:15] <Sussysham> ok

[17:15] <dakkar> (but I don't know anything about Comma, sorry)

[17:15] <Sussysham> np

[17:15] <lizmat> Sussysham: couldn't you just download the standalone version?  https://commaide.com/download

[17:16] <lizmat> afk&

[17:17] <Sussysham> it is theone

[17:17] <Sussysham> that i downloaded

[17:18] <Sussysham> when i create new project it says no sdk specified

[17:18] <Sussysham> sdk is required for compiling debugginng

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> does comma not have an IRC channel maybe?

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh btw
