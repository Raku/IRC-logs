[10:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> what are those called?

[10:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1094933451678945320/image.png

[10:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corner_bracket

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> probably pasting it into google would also do the trick but you can just paste it into the repl and invoke the uniname method on it

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the unicode name is usually descriptive

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: '｣'.uniname.say

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  HALFWIDTH RIGHT CORNER BRACKET 

[10:46] <lizmat> m: .say for '｢｣'.uninames

[10:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar e68322dbc: OUTPUT: «HALFWIDTH LEFT CORNER BRACKET␤HALFWIDTH RIGHT CORNER BRACKET␤»

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> thank you

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> oh nice

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> what is the m: ?

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the prefix of the chatbot

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> '｣'.uniname.say did not work inside my raku file

[11:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> oh it worked

[11:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Mediocre> thank you i did try to google but was sending me to some korean websites for some reason

[11:27] <lizmat> I guess ｢｣ are more common as quotation marks in Korean

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> It provides bidirectional communication with the raku-beginner channel of IRC

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> so those usernames are from the other side

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat/ is one way to join the IRC network

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> web based one

[17:10] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/04/10/2023-15-testing-patterns/
