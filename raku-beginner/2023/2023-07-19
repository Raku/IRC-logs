[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> deoac: very regrettably, one doesn't install modules for Raku (same for Perl) - one always has to install a so-called distribution that happens to provide that module

[08:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you probably wanted to install https://github.com/Raku/Pod-To-HTML/blob/master/META6.json

[08:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but zef preferred https://github.com/finanalyst/raku-pod-render/blob/94ab6a32e560239d3a60c791f834ebae1fc5a1a1/META6.json

[08:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this essentially forces you to always discriminate the module using the auth field

[08:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Pod::To::HTML:auth<github:Raku> is clear

[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> this is the reason the Pod::To::HTML module of raku-pod-render got eventually renamed to Pod::To::HTML2 but the damage couldn't be undone

[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> anyway, a modern version of raku-pod-render is quite possibly better than the old Pod::To:HTML
