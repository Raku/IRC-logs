[23:37] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> I was trying to split a raku regex up earlier- is this a sane approach?    my $date-regex = rx/ $<year> = /d ** 4                             '-'                   $<month> = /d ** 2                             '-'                   $<day> = /d ** 2 / 

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> I gave up on using this approach, but was hoping to use named captures to print lines in more readable format

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> an example string: 2023-06-22T19:12:16+00:00

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> so if i wanted to grab the year, month, day out of this via a regex capture (and in my particular case this date format can be assumed)

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> the thing would compile, but I couldn't figure out how to pull out the individual matches from a .match

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Shouldn't those /d's be \d's?

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Do you have a JS background? In JS, you can indeed look up keys of a hash as if it was an attribute of an object but you cannot do that in most languages

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> Yes, sorry. Was hastily typing pseudocode

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> Yes also, though I'm not a 'real' programmer most of my experience is in node

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Oh, I see what you mean now

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> For the better or worse, I think this really sticks from JS, this mentality that hashes and records/objects are the same thing from different angles

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> In Raku, you can do a hash lookup using {} or <> so quite nicely <year> called on the match object would work presumably

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Yes, that's what I was trying to find

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd double check the syntax and precedence of named captures just to be sure

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> you can treat the resulting match like a hash

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> so $<submatch> is going to default to looking at $/ (most recent match), but if you didn't match in a way that sets $/, you need to look up on whatever you assigned into with something like $match-obj<submatch>
