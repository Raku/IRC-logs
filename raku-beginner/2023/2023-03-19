[10:10] <snonux> hey there, is there a way to print all possibilities of an given enum? E.g., i would like to get Tick Trick and Track out of Foo. raku -e 'enum Foo <Tick Trick Track>; Foo.say'; 

[10:10] <snonux> (Foo)

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: enum Foo <Tick Trick Track>; say Foo.keys;

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (Track Tick Trick) 

[10:12] <snonux> ‚ùØ raku -e 'enum Foo <Tick Trick Track>; Foo.^enum_value_list.say';

[10:12] <snonux> (Tick Trick Track)

[10:12] <snonux> ah, keys is better, thanks a lot!

[10:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It's kind of a Map

[10:14] <snonux> like a Ruby Set, which is a map but only with keys

[10:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Or a Raku Set üòâ

[10:15] <snonux> :D

[10:16] <snonux> One day, i have to blog about my favourite Ruby features and how they work in Raku. Could also encourage more Ruby developers to try out Raku. 

[10:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I heard Ruby also stated off as a "fixed Perl"

[10:23] <snonux> There's some truth to it. I started off with Perl, then (due to my job), switched to Ruby (while still using Perl for some personal projects), and now, I start to fall in love with Raku.

[15:01] <snonux> OK, one difference between MyEnum.^enum_value_list and just MyEnum.keys is, that .keys returns a sequence of Str, whereas ^enum_value_list really returns a Seq of enums. 

[15:02] <snonux> raku -e 'enum Foo <Tick Trick Track>; subset Bar of Foo where * ne any (Track); say Foo.^enum_value_list.first.WHAT, Foo.keys.first.WHAT'

[15:02] <snonux> (Foo)(Str)

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one looks like standard Raku, the other is in metamodel territory
