[15:28] <deoac> Can I use zef to list which of my installed distributions need to be upgraded (without actually upgrading them)?

[15:41] <dakkar> `zef --/test --/build --dry upgrade` might give you some approximation of that

[16:28] <deoac> dakkar Thanks - I didn't notice the --dry flag.

[16:28] <dakkar> notice that `--dry` only prevents *installation*

[16:29] <dakkar> if you only use that, zef will fetch+build+test everything

[16:29] <dakkar> just not install anything

[16:32] <deoac> dakkar Right, with the other flags you suggested, I get exactly the list I want.Â  Though I takes longer than I expected.
