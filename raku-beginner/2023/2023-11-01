[09:05] <ab5tract_> .vushu: when I try to install Raylib::Bindings on macOS, it dies with errors and warnings during compilation: https://gist.github.com/ab5tract/f5bc5ea91f97b050fe5265e4c2fb0be7

[09:14] *** golu8 left
[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> have you installed raylib on your machine

[11:11] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> right now the bindings doesnâ€™t support windows or mac. This is something that I would like to support.

[11:29] <ab5tract_> .vushu yes I have ray lib installed and have modified Makefile.in to include the necessary path

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> you need to modify this line https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/1a3c595e99012fbe1c7b3ff609e1639ecb3215ea/configure.raku#L13C13-L13C13

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> of where your raylib.h is located I think

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> right now it's hardcoded :d
