[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch  and @.vushu I cannot install "HTML::Canvas", (and it does not seem be actively maintained.) Any other suggestions on image making and exports with Raku would be appreciated!

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well it works for me

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. Good to know! On what OS?

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Ubuntu ðŸ¤ 

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. Next time I try to follow your advice, I will keep in mind that it is Ubuntu-dependent.

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I mean, there are plenty of native packages that are needed

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> good old C ABI

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, so it seems...

[17:56] <ab5tract> antononcube: you use macOS, correct?

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, macOS.
