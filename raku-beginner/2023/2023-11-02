[19:18] <Dominika> mmm... I'm getting a very similar issue to this one: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4895 - but when installing with zef, not while trying to use the module. Can't seem to find `src/Perl/World.nqp` anywhere under /usr and /var (there's /usr/share/rakudo/lib/Perl6/World.moarvm tho..?), so I don't know what to poke with a stick further

[19:18] *** Dominika is now known as sdomi

[19:23] <sdomi> seems that I don't have a World.nqp anywhere locally at all (which, now that I think of it, makes sense, because I didn't compile raku locally)

[19:24] <ab5tract_> World.moarvm is the compiled version of World.nqp

[19:27] <sdomi> yeah, i got that much :) moment of confusion, sorry

[19:28] <sdomi> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/139f0e97cc7c861bd85cbe5dca3de9886a770cbd/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L2605 <-- seems to crash here

[19:36] <sdomi> curiously, the library works if I clone the git repo and run it from there; I don't see any significant changes between the last release in zef and the current HEAD, too

[19:48] <ab5tract_> What if you run `zef install .` from the git repo?

[20:01] <sdomi> just checked, same thing

[20:15] <ab5tract_> :(

[20:22] <sdomi> for now i'm gonna just run this locally, but eh. hopefully i can figure out what's wrong in general :(
