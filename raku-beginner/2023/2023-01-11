[01:27] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> this compilation error: `Type check failed in binding to parameter '$address'; expected Str but got Any (Any)`

[01:27] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> no `$address` in my source...

[01:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> may I ask what your code is?

[01:28] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> I think the error comes from  rakudo\src\core.c\Distribution\Locally.pm6

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> code is pretty simple similar to  - `class This::Thing is Other::Module::Thing {}`

[01:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the error message is quite clearly LTA

[01:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how do you tell the compiler where it could find your compunit?

[01:33] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> I have `-Ilib,.,xt - and then I have links in my lib/ to ../../Other/Module/lib/Module

[01:33] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> I will play with paths...

[01:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> -I flag?

[01:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm far from educated on these matters but I think the two things here are use lib and the -I flag

[01:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I would expect links to be resolved but who knows

[01:43] <rf> I think it's trying to bind to a parameter $address in the sub/method being called, check the line and see if the caller parameter is Nil.

[01:53] <deoac> I'm trying to view https://theweeklychallenge.org/ but the menu (Home, About, ... Contact) takes up nearly the entire screen.¬† This happens in both Safari and Chrome.¬† I have no ad blockers enabled.¬† Is this happening to anyone else?

[01:54] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> looks ok on desktop - but the menu stacks when you reduce the width down

[01:56] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> actually there is something wrong - the top menu disappears probably ment to be behind a trigram - but you cant access it. The secondary menu is large dark buttons - this stacks pushing the content down a couple of pages

[02:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you mean the "hamburger menu"?

[02:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, that site always worked "good enough" for me

[02:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wonder if we'd have to settle for an O(n^2) solution for the second task üòõ

[02:08] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> so `Type check failed in binding to parameter '$address'; expected Str but got Any (Any)` happens when you have links in your lib folder to folders containing other modules, I think because it finds the compunit but is confused about which distribution it belongs in

[02:09] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> if you remove the links and instead do everything via a long `-Ilib,../Module1/lib,../Mod2/lib` it seems to work ok

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be good to note this some way

[02:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> IRC, issue, StackOverflow, Reddit, I don't know

[02:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for some random reason, it seems that Jonathan Worthington is hanging out quite a lot on SO actually

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> maybe lots of warm  Raspberry Pi üòõ

[02:34] <deoac> Reducing the width of the window did the trick.¬† Weird.

[15:37] <rf> lizmat: That worked perfectly, thank you!

[15:38] <lizmat> you can even make it look like a sub if you want:

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lizmat: does your from module not provide some sugar for this?

[15:48] <lizmat> yup

[15:48] <lizmat> thanks for reminding me :-)

[16:03] <rf> Is there any way to make a class attribute completely immutable?

[16:04] <rf> I want it to be not assignable, and also the type to be frozen so you can't screw with it

[16:08] <lizmat> is it a private attribute ?

[16:16] <rf> Sort of? I override the getter, and it's not rw

[16:20] <lizmat> class A { my constant foo = 42; method getter { foo } }

[16:21] <lizmat> or

[16:21] <lizmat> class A { method getter(--> 42) { } }

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyone familiar with https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/Storable::Lite?

[17:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I just get error when I try to store data: `$metals.to-file('metals.raku');` gets me: `No such method 'to-file' for invocant of type 'Str'`

[17:55] <tbrowder> stevied pls file an issue.

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok

[17:56] <tbrowder> that is a pretty naive approach and may not be worth using

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> here you go: https://github.com/tbrowder/Storable-Lite/issues/1

[17:59] <tbrowder> thnx, i will try to fix

[19:09] <tbrowder> stevied: since i created that module,i‚Äôve been using JSON::Fast to basically do the same thing. Also, that module is heavily used, actively maintained, and has top-tier authors.

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is Storable::Lite for exactly?

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It seems simple enough to fix, if it should be fixed

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> <@563790557831495691> by the way, have you checked out https://raku.land/zef:finanalyst/RakuConfig ?

[19:33] *** deoac joined
[19:51] *** deoac left
[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> it's like perl's old storable module. I'm just going to convert the data to json and save that to a file

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> yeah, I went with json. I am not as familiar with that format so not sure if it might break with the data in some way while I can be sure something that serializes rak directly would work.

[21:47] *** n1to joined
[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so I'm using JSON::Fast with `my %raku = from-json 'metas.json'.IO.slurp;` and that line is dumping the entire data structure to the screen

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> no idea why this is happening

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there must be something that we cannot see from this snippet

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> this is how the json was saved:

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> my $json = to-json [ $metas ];

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> spurt 'metas.json', $json;

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> $metas is a hash

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> maybe that makes a difference?

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does spurt take?

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> not sure what you mean. it's saving the json data

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lines() operates on `$*IN`, I was thinking if it could be operating on `$*OUT` by sheer chance

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but that doesn't seem to match the docs

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> why not?

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/spurt#(Independent_routines)_sub_spurt

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, how are you running the code?

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> in a raku script

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ugh, this is why  I didn't want to use json. no fucking idea what I'm doing.

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> wonder why that's not on the docs

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, what docs? this is a random module

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> docs in the module

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> https://github.com/tbrowder/Storable-Lite/tree/master/docs

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> probably simply because nobody bothered to write it down

[22:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not all published stuff is equally well maintained

[22:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> fortunately, the source code is pretty simple

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so looks like I got this json working. no idea how. just random trial and error

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so if I save the data structure as a hash and restore it to a scalar, it works: `my $raku = from-json 'metas.json'.IO.slurp;`

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> the `$raku` behaves like a hash

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> well, at any rate, I now have all meta files for every version of every distro in one giant file. only took me 2 friggin' days to do. haven't coded in raku for a few months and I got rusty fast.

[22:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> but in my defense, it was a little tricky to figure out

[22:34] <rf> That's cool, you should host this somewhere, you can be the Raku archivist

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> rf: do you know REA?

[22:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> that's where I got the data from

[22:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> all the meta files are in a tarball

[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so i had to extract each meta file

[22:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyway, now i'm closer to the goal of forking each module with legacy file names and submitting a patch

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> curious to see how it works out

[22:47] <rf> Lol that is awesome, goodluck!

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> thanks. i figured it was a one day project but now it looks like it's turning into more like a one week project. üôÇ
