[06:39] <deadmarshal_> How can I check if all characters of a string are a subset of a set? https://0x0.st/Hiv1.txt

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What does @arr hold?

[09:41] <CIAvash> 'str'.comb âŠ‚ $set

[10:31] <deadmarshal_> Nemokosch: strings

[10:31] <deadmarshal_> https://0x0.st/Hiwc.txt

[10:32] <deadmarshal_> CIAvash: Did I do something wrong here? https://0x0.st/Hiwc.txt

[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > @arr = @arr.lc; this itself is problematic

[11:37] <lizmat> @arr = @arr>>.lc

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: my @arr = <alpha beta gamma>; dd @arr; @arr = @arr.lc; dd @arr;

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Array @arr = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"] Array @arr = ["alpha beta gamma"] 

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'd allow equal sets as well, knowing the task, not only strict subsets

[11:55] <deadmarshal_> lizmat: thanks that was the problem

[11:55] <deadmarshal_> Nemokosch: ok I'll make it so 

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl my $str = "Nice to meet you"; say $str.uniq; 

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 No such method 'uniq' for invocant of type 'Str'.  Did you mean 'unique'?   in block <unit> at main.raku line 2  

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl my $str = "Nice to meet you"; say $str.unique; 

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (Nice to meet you) 

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> ðŸ¤”

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is a method for iterables I guess

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl my $str = "Nice to meet you"; say $str.comb.unique; 

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (N i c e   t o m y u) 

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl my $str = "Nice to meet you"; say $str.lc.comb.unique.sort.join; 

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>   ceimnotuy 

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> m:perl my $str = "Nice to meet you"; say $str.lc.comb.unique.sort.join.raku; 

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  " ceimnotuy" 

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> where did the space go

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's right there

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> i mean here

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1084454715548508231/image.png

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, there

[12:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> bruh

[12:37] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> the mobile client doesn't show the space smh
