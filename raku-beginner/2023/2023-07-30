[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <jsexplorerthefirst> How do I experiment with js and jvm backends of rakudo? I am not scared of nqp, I just wish I could be pointed to 1. The correct repo with working examples and 2. The correct commands together with pre-requisite installs for a standard ubuntu installation. Can anyone advise please? I am always super confused by Perl/Raku/NQP/Rakudo/Perl6 nomenclature

[18:10] * lizmat has no personal experience with JS and JVM backends

[18:11] <lizmat> however re nomenclature: I think you can remove "Perl6" from that for sure, and maybe "Perl" as well  :-)

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tanto_grs Try to get Jupyter extensions installed in VSCode, and try “Jupyter:;Kernel”.

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Assuming, you talking about using VSCode for/with Raku.

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> The Jupiter::Kernel? Realy? I will try it

[20:09] <thowe> if I want to run the ping command, and get the results, should I use run or shell?

[20:10] <lizmat> is ping a shell command or an executable?

[20:10] <lizmat> if executable, then run

[20:12] <thowe> it is it's own executable...  Thanks!  I want to see if I can do some Raku (and Cro?) tools to create data for Prometheus to scrape.

[20:13] <thowe> I think most of them out there are written in Go.

[20:18] <snonux> should be possible, as the scraping API used by Prometheus is plain text. But there is no official library available to instrumenting your Raku program.

[20:38] <thowe> Yeah, I wasn't sure how I was going to go about it...  One thought was to just dump the text file to a location that prometheus can get it via http, but the problem with that is error handling.  I think it would be better to have a Cro service that can give proper error codes if something goes wrong.

[20:39] <thowe> I should probably study one of the simpler Go utils to see what it does.

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> Thx, i will Show and try and i will BE write you an answer :-)
