[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyone know of any Raku modules that store a user's data in a config directory similar to what this old perl module does: https://metacpan.org/release/ADAMK/File-UserConfig-0.06/view/lib/File/UserConfig.pm

[14:25] <lizmat> https://raku.land/?q=config  has a list I think

[14:33] <dakkar> https://modules.raku.org/dist/XDG::BaseDirectory:zef:zef:jonathanstowe this one follows the correct standards under Linux

[14:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok, thanks. will check it out

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i have an array that's something like this:

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> <a b b b b z b b b b x b b b b>

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> after every four b's, there's some trash information i want to throw away

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> is there some function that deletes every nth element of an array?

[23:08] <lizmat> the "a" is *not* garbage?

[23:09] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> *before every four b's

[23:09] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> the a is also garbage

[23:12] <lizmat> maybe something with .rotor?

[23:12] <lizmat> m: say <a b b b b z b b b b x b b b b>.rotor(1,4)

[23:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5189750d8: OUTPUT: ¬´((a) (b b b b) (z) (b b b b) (x) (b b b b))‚ê§¬ª

[23:13] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> thank u, but then how do i remove the (a) and the (z) and the (b)

[23:13] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i could do it right now, but i'm thinking of some stuff i can chuck onto the end of the line i already have

[23:14] <lizmat> m: say <a b b b b z b b b b x b b b b>.rotor(1,4).map: -> $bad, @good { |@good }

[23:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5189750d8: OUTPUT: ¬´(b b b b b b b b b b b b)‚ê§¬ª

[23:16] <lizmat> the |@good is slipping all of the good values into a single list

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> that works pretty snazzy, thank you

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i still can't figure out what slipping does. like, i get kind of what it's used for, but i don't know what sort of black magic is used to get that result

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> should we look it up?

[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i did, and it's just the usual arcane mutterings of raku

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> where did you find it?

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> https://docs.raku.org/type/Slip

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> like, ok, i understand its behaviour. that's what the docs are for.

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> but i don't know the logic behind what it is

[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, should we look up the sources?

[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ohh

[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> maybe

[23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> how?

[23:23] *** Kaiepi left
[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm hoping that this would be implemented in the core and some guesses could take us really close to it

[23:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tbh I might have been a little optimistic xD

[23:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, I'd like to share my thinking pattern, maybe that can also help, either me or someone else...

[23:31] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> sure

[23:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so first it would be good to figure out what "containers" support slips

[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is somewhat worrying that I seem to vaguely recall something with X and Z with regards to slips, they didn't support them or something

[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which implies there might be a hack on top of the data structures

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a Seq taken from map definitely supports Slips

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so atm I'm checking Iterable

[23:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no avail

[23:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, then let's try to see what a map does

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> on second thought, "black magic" is a good enough answer for me

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Too bad, I got curious xD

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> if u figure something out u can tell me but chances are it's gonna go over my head

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> looking up what gets called when you do `map *.Slip, (1, 2, 3)` is simple with CoreHackers::Sourcery

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/2022.12/src/core.c/Any-iterable-methods.pm6#L2619

[23:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this monster-file is suspicious the least to say

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/704a05b934ba10f3240e8764827bbfd7fe089cdf/src/core.c/Any-iterable-methods.pm6#L913 dispatches to this I suppose?

[23:53] <rf> Does anyone know how you can nicely format Raku dates to the HTTP date spec, I am doing a bunch of garbage to do it but I feel like there is a much better way to do it.

[23:53] <rf> Thu, 31 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT (the spec)

[23:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you maybe know the name of this specification

[23:54] <rf> No.

[23:55] <rf> GMT?

[23:55] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> GMT is the time zone

[23:57] *** ToddAndMargo joined
[23:57] <rf> When it comes to dates and times I've always been at a loss :L

[23:57] <ToddAndMargo> how do I wrire in binary mode?

[23:57] <ToddAndMargo> ¬†¬† my $Handle = open "$WanIpFileName", :rw, :bin;

[23:57] <ToddAndMargo> ¬†¬† $Handle.print( $MyScrambleStr );

[23:57] <ToddAndMargo> ¬†¬† $Handle.close;

[23:58] <ToddAndMargo> ¬†Cannot do 'print' on a handle in binary mode
