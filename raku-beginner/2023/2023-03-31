[02:29] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Is it possible to have an attribute alias? I have a class with the has UInt7  $.vol_note-on = 127; attribute and I would like to have an alias with $.vol and if used it would just assign to $.vol_note-on

[06:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> AttrX::Mooish probably gives you a declarative interface for that; other than that, I'd probably go for binding

[10:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> so i was trying to install jupyter kernal

[10:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> then dependencies issues

[10:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> jupyter kernal requires

[10:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> shell::command

[10:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> which then requires File::Find and File::which

[10:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> but there is no::file which on raku.land

[10:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you are right but it does install nevertheless

[10:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lol

[10:23] <lizmat> there's https://raku.land/github:azawawi/File::Which

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ah you were faster

[10:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> ok for some  reason zef is   !!!> Failed to update rea mirror: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json

[10:31] <lizmat> wfm

[10:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for me as well

[10:31] <lizmat> has been static (as in no new updates in the past 4 hours)

[10:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what version of zef?

[10:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> 0.18.0

[10:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> heh, I'm stuck at 0.14.5

[10:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> time to zef upgrade zef

[10:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> works with 0.18.2 as well

[10:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think you could also upgrade, there were some bugfixes

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> couldn't state that it would solve your issue but it shouldn't make things worse at least ðŸ˜„

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> I just want to cry man whenever i use zef it returns some issue

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> ðŸ¥¹

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> XDD

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what system?

[10:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> windows

[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> oof

[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> everything is possible on Windows...

[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for that matter, the update was meant to fix some Windows issues

[10:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lol

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what if it's the issue that was fixed that keeps you from doing the upgrade? xD

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> can i manually delete and install zef

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> i will do that

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> now

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> cool, it can install itself

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> bootstrapping stronk

[10:45] <lizmat> raku -I. bin/zef install .

[10:45] <lizmat> when in the zef repo

[10:46] <lizmat> that's because the actual installation logic actually lives in Rakudo itself

[10:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1091312572340375582/file_which.png

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> i don't like to keep whining but it is what it is

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's not listed on modules.raku.org either

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but anyway, it does exist and it should install

[10:48] <lizmat> it's listed, but there is a "bug" in raku.land's ordering of results

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> understandable

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> quotes why?

[10:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> then the same bug appears on modules.raku.org as well because that doesn't list it just as much

[10:49] <lizmat> https://raku.land/?page=4&q=File%3A%3AWhich

[10:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay... then it only doesn't appear on modules.raku.org, damn

[10:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> persists

[11:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's the output with verbose mode?

[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> don't know what is verbose mode

[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> or whoes verbose mode?

[11:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Sussysham> Good Day everyone
