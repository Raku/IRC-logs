[05:21] <deoac> Is there a Test module that provides a `throws-like` test that can also test the .message thrown?

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> is Int $n syntactic sugar for $n where Int?

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> hm good question, maybe not

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> m: sub foo(Int $a) { say $a.WHAT }; sub fooer($a where Int) {say $a.Int}; foo(32); fooer('40');

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (Int)  Exit code: 1 Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$a'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Str ("40")   in sub fooer at main.raku line 1   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1   

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> Not sure how to check this actually, maybe with a subtype of Int? and see if .WHAT is changed

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's definitely not sugar for that

[10:46] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> but constrain $n to an Int

[10:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that would probably also have dispatch implications, khm-khm, it's hard to tell without actually knowing the dispatch process

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch>  my $foo where Int; dd $foo 

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m:  my $foo where Int; dd $foo 

[10:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  <anon $foo = <anon>  

[10:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the container is different

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> gotcha, this should be telling enough...

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m:  my $foo where Int = 22; $foo.VAR.of.say; 

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (<anon>)  

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> versus

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m:  my Int $foo = 22; $foo.VAR.of.say; 

[10:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (Int)

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> so raku just create a subset of Mu with that constraint and check against it

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> substitute that Mu for Any

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> ah yes Any is the effective root of the class hierachy

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> i say effective because almost everything treats Any as the top

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> even though it is not

[11:53] <lizmat> indeed.   the difference between Mu and Any allows for auto-threading of Junctions

[14:42] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/02/13/2023-07-core-class/
