[06:39] <CIAvash> avuserow: There is also the experimental (and undocumented?) `will complain` trait for use in subsets. `use experimental :will-complain;`. Example: https://codeberg.org/CIAvash/APISports-Football/src/commit/7b17664a794449e5f97cceb2ad3a01ae11883f64/lib/APISports/Football/Types.rakumod#L46

[13:58] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/05/22/2023-21-maxcinating/

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <JsExplorerNeil> Is there a sane way to easily create js code in the browser? I tried perlito6 and I couldn't get it to work

[14:17] <lizmat> wow, perlito...   that's a while since I heard about that  (10 years or so?)

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <JsExplorerNeil> @Raku bridge how do I transpile Raku to js

[14:18] <lizmat> jsExplorerNeil looks like trying the Javascript backend would be the best way to go... but sadly, that also has bitrotted the past years :-(

[15:42] <habere-et-disper> I understand this:

[15:42] <habere-et-disper> m: sub pear ( Pair $_ ) { say .key ~ ' => ' ~ .value }; say pear( 3 => 4 );

[15:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 826eca3f8: OUTPUT: «3 => 4␤True␤»

[15:42] <habere-et-disper> But what am I saying/doing if I omit the $_ like so:

[15:42] <habere-et-disper> m: sub pear ( Pair ) { say .key ~ ' => ' ~ .value }; say pear( 3 => 4 )

[15:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 826eca3f8: OUTPUT: «No such method 'key' for invocant of type 'Any'.  Did you mean 'keys'?␤  in sub pear at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think this is akin to sub pear ( True )  or sub pear ( 2 )

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, although... wouldn't the dispatch fail then

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one thing is sure, $_ is taken lexically and hence it's the default value Any

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it seems to work as a type annotation, not a constant value

[16:12] <habere-et-disper> So is there another way to subordinate the detail of making the topic explicit here ?

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <JsExplorerNeil> @Nemokosch is there a recommended way to transpile Raku to js/Java? Is there a reliable Raku webasm implementation? Just wondering if there is a tool like Perlito (Perlito6 would not compile my Raku code taken from the example grammar taken from the example code on the Raku homepage)

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no, there isn't. There is a mostly abandoned runtime written in Javascript, and a semi-functional runtime written in Java. I wouldn't swear by the latter either but it's also not what you seem to be asking for, as it doesn't translate into Java, rather runs on top of a Java program

[16:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > So is there another way to subordinate the detail of making the topic explicit here ? sorry, I cannot understand this

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <JsExplorerNeil> Is there a transpiler from Raku to Perl5 maybe? Perlito works for Perl5 (from what I have seen)

[16:35] *** dakkar left
[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't know about it

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <JsExplorerNeil> Thanks for answering.
