[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Yesterday I was playing around like in https://conf.raku.org/talk/204 - for this I activated RAKUAST  cat ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/my_raku.zsh export RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1  All worked fine, I could convert Code from one Language to another. Very interesting feature! Especially for education!  However, today I can not run any raku script   zef --version fez --version create-workflows-4-github  all die with  ===SORRY!===

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> Parameter * quantifier not applicable to sigil ''   Also after setting RAKUDO_RAKUAST=0 I can not get them running.    raku -e "say 12345"  works.  I am using Raku v2023.10 on iOS 12.7.1 (Monterey)  I do not understand why I get the error, why it is not disapearing after setting RAKUDO_RAKUAST=0 and start a fresh Shell and how I can get back to a working system. (No, I did not restart my computer, No, I did not

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> re-install Raku, No I did not re-install iOS - yet ;-)

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> What would you do now to resolve the issue?

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Any hints?

[09:06] <lizmat> rcmlz interesting...  hmmmm

[09:06] <lizmat> are you building from source ?

[09:08] <tea3po> does RAKUDO_RAKUAST=0 do something different from unset RAKUDO_RAKUAST

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> no, using brew

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> just running a brew upgrade to ensure I am up2date.

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> unset RAKUDO_RAKUASTdid the trick! Thank you.

[09:10] * tea3po fistpump

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I was just about to re-install MacOS!

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> :-)

[09:11] <lizmat> yeah, you only want to set RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 for testing at the moment  :-)

[09:14] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I realy like the idea of pupils implementing a solution in the Language of their choice (even making up own ones, like "Romulan" or "Smileys-Only" or "Vampvanish") adn then "translating" to English before handing in to the teacher.

[09:17] <lizmat> rclmz perhaps you could provide a translation for one or ore languages you're proficient in?

[10:31] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Yes, where I live there are many languages spoken by the pupils, will see how can integrate that oportunity "make my own language" to motivate Programming.

[10:33] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/tools/templates/L10N/CONTEXT.md should give some context

[10:37] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Thank you

[10:45] <lizmat> tea3po: you should unset atm
