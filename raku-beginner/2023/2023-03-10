[02:26] <deoac> I've just installed the latest rakudo-star.Â  rakudoc -b has no effect.Â  Where should I look for the documentation?

[02:41] *** Heptite joined
[03:03] <rf> deoac: docs.raku.org, though you should be able to use rakudoc

[03:03] <rf> maybe try zef install rakudoc

[03:03] *** rf left
[03:07] <deoac> I tried zef install rakudoc.Â  No effect.

[03:10] <deoac> I know I can browse the website, but often rakudoc is more convenient.

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> >  I thought it -Ofun to see forgiven! ðŸ™‚ habere-et-disper: not sure if you still care about it but this works now  use Slang::Forgiven;  forgiven "yeS".comb -> $char {     when / <.upper> / { put "$char shouts" }     when / <.lower> / { put "i like $char" }     default { put "$char is from others" } } it took me only 4 months

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> thank you
