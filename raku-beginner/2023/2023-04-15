[18:44] <deoac> Is there a way to automatically generate a table of contents for POD6 code?

[18:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'd check around finanalyst's work

[19:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @deoac I am not sure I can help with your question, but I will consider optionally generating TOC for Pod6 in "Markdown::Grammar".

[20:47] <deoac> Thank you both!

[20:47] <deoac> Is there a convention for creating/naming/running a smoke test?

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @deoac Use Gherkin.

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok, that was a shameless advertisement.

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @deoac Within the Raku ecosystem I only use the module "Test" -- or file generating test files "Test" expects. Smoke tests -- can be put in the directories "t/" or "xt/" of a module.
