[01:57] <MasterDuke> mcmillhj: i think you'll have to (re)assign it to something typed. e.g., `my Int @a = 1,3,2,6,4; @a .= sort; dd @a`  #  OUTPUT: Array[Int] @a = Array[Int].new(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

[02:36] <mcmillhj> oh okay, I had typed the container already but was passing the result of the sort to a subroutine and that was the issue. sorting like you did in your example seems to typecheck and work just fine. Thank you!
