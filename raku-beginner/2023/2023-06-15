[18:46] <Guest2884> I am trying to start a raku project. Is there a way to initialize a project and get the layout all set up automatically?

[18:48] <lizmat> App::Mi6 is what I use

[18:53] <Guest2884> Thank you!!

[18:57] <Guest2884> How do I use it? Once I installed it using zef I tried mi6 new Foo::Bar and it didn't work

[18:57] <moritz_> what does "didn't work" mean, precisely? did you try "mi6 help" or so?

[19:04] <Guest2884> My fault I installed it incorrectly. Got it working now. Thanks for the quick help anyway
