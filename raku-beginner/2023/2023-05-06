[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah works in irc too

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Oddly, the irc version is monochrome here in discord. But in my IRC client, both are rainbow

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Oh probably different fonts on my side, monospaced vs proportional

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well, I get in colour on both .... but different fonts

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> One of mine is just purple and white, but still effectively monochrome compared to the rainbow version 😄

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> me, I'm quite surprised that unicode even works

[18:39] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I feel the same way about computers in general.
