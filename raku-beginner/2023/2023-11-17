[14:43] <stanrifkin> Is there a way to check if an variable is immutable?

[14:44] <stanrifkin> constant $var = 31; if $var.mutable { ... }

[14:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> short of a CATCH block, I don't know ... good question!

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok this seems to work: constant $x =3; say $.VAR.WHICH;   #Int|3

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my $y = 42; say $y.VAR.WHICH;     #Scalar|3768135182992

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> $x.VAR ~~ Scalar   #False

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> $y.VAR ~~ Scalar    #True

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this works because all the non-container forms of a "variable" are really terms and binding (constant, my \x =42)

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so you are looking for a (Scalar) container to find mutability

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this https://docs.raku.org/type/ValueObjAt does the job for Positionals that may contain mutable containers

[14:59] <stanrifkin> librasteve: thank you

[15:33] <gfldex> m: my $thing := Proxy.new: FETCH => my method { $ } , STORE => my method (|) {}; sub foo($x is rw) { say $x.VAR.WHAT; }.($thing);

[15:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f29cecfad: OUTPUT: «(Proxy)␤»

[15:34] <gfldex> @librasteve: It can also be a Proxy, however, you can't really know if that definite Proxy allows STORE.

[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah yes - thanks .... so is there a more MOPpy way to check eg, for an l-value role?

[15:52] <gfldex> You have to descent into NQP-land and check the descriptor. With RakuAST you could use a macro to check the declaration (and its context) of the symbol.
