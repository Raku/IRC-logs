[18:42] <jgaz> Apparently the precedence of = is too loose for the ?? ternary operator? Why is that? I was able to "fix" it with `<test> ?? ($foo = val) !! ($bar = val)`, but I'm not sure that's optimal either.

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> isn't that the normal way? I can't think of a language where you'd need to write variable = (condition ? aValue : bValue), with the parens

[18:44] <jgaz> I don't think I have to do that in Perl, I can check...

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the ternary operator is not for side effects, after all

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the true irony is, though, that your example can be rewritten without parens, if you want to golf it so badly:

[18:48] <jgaz> Okay, so I can make it work, but the precidence is wrong if I have an equals. It silently fails to do the right thing.

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> <test> ?? $foo !! $bar = val

[18:49] <jgaz> Silent failure is Perl 5.

[18:49] <jgaz> hmm... okay.

[18:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I would say it looks weird but it seems to do the "set one of the variables to val, depending on the test" thing

[18:52] <jgaz> I will say, at least Raku gives me a warning that there is a precidence issue.

[18:53] <jgaz> IDK if it's code golf exactly, but yeah, I like to do as much as I can on one line as reasonably possible.

[18:53] <jgaz> This is especially true on a return line.

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> If you are okay with repeating val, I'd definitely prefer an if-else

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if not, then maybe (<test> ?? $foo !! $bar) = val, with the parens for readability

[18:57] <jgaz> Hmm... I'll play with that.
