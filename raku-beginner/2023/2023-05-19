[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I think you need to pass an anonymous method: :c(method {say self.b})

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Not sure if there's a way to apply that to an existing callable.

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Doesn't seem like it. But you could always pass self as a parameter if it's just a callable.
