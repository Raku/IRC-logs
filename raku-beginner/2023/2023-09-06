[18:55] <wafflus> when looping thought a file how do i get the next line after i match?

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Could you illustrate it?

[19:11] <wafflus> when /\.ITEM/' {get next line and print }

[19:14] *** ab5tract left
[19:16] <wafflus> maybe i need a state var

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you can retrieve a line from a file handle using get, if that helps

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the other solution I'm looking into is with toggle

[19:22] <wafflus> yeah i've been messing around alot as well lol

[19:27] <wafflus> i;m sure i will get it using the get it took me a few mine to understand how to use it

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> at the end of the day, it depends what you want to do, too

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I managed it with toggle eventually

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 'filename'.IO.lines.toggle(:off, *.match(pattern)) is the sequence of lines starting from the match

[19:29] <wafflus> ok thanks

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you need a more stateful, more procedural processing, I'd use something like

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> loop (my $fh = open('filename'.IO), my $line = $fh.get; $line.defined; $line = $fh.get) { ... }

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> do something depending on the value of $line, maybe fetch the next line

[19:31] <wafflus> k iyeah that's what i was trying to do :)

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> keep in mind that in this case, $fh and $line belong to the surrounding scope so they are visible after the loop as well

[19:36] <wafflus> so confusing i'll get it eventually

[19:39] <wafflus> raku -e ' loop (my $fh = open("./install-next.txt".IO), my $line = $fh.get; $line.defined; $line = $fh.get) {.say when /\.ITEM/ }'

[19:39] <wafflus> why am i geting this error all the time Use of uninitialized value of type Any in string context.

[19:39] <wafflus> Methods .^name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.

[19:39] <wafflus> Â  in block  at -e line 1

[19:49] <wafflus> i got it cu around thanks

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> because you are calling .say without having a topic set

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you could wrap it in given $line { }
