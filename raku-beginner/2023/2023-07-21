[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> How can I use run to "fire and forget" a process? I don't want to capture any output or anything, I just need it to start the process. Also note the process is something that stays running in the background, normally when launching it in CLI I would use & disown

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nhail I think you are looking for the functionalities provided by: -  shell  : https://docs.raku.org/routine/shell - run :  https://docs.raku.org/routine/run - Proc : https://docs.raku.org/type/Proc

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> I've been reading run, let me look in the others real quick

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> thanks

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nhail   Sorry, I misread this fragment : "Also note the process is something that stays running in the background [...]" -- you should use Proc.

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Okay, thanks

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> For context, this is starting mpv with the IPC server open

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nhail Sorry -- I have more say. ðŸ™‚ I use(d) Proc to do "fire and forget" in this package : https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Proc::ZMQed

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, then pointing out "Proc::ZMQed" is relevant.

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See the lines with Proc::Async.new in: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Proc-ZMQed/blob/main/lib/Proc/ZMQed/Abstraction.rakumod

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Solved.

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Proc::Async.new(<mpv --idle --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket>).start;

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Thanks for the links
