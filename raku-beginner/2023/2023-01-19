[02:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> <@563790557831495691> by the way, I'm definitely counting on you with the squashathon revival idea

[02:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> <@297037173541175296> heh, you mean the legacy extension updater?

[03:00] <rf> stevied: Yeah I use syntax highlighting.

[03:01] *** rf left
[03:06] <jaguart> I tend to swap context a lot - I like UltraEdit - Project has as many Dists as you want, Syntax highlight, Code explorer, simple and fast - screenshot: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29786965/213345826-d008e9ac-dce8-4344-868a-8be1a70ff5f3.png

[03:09] <jaguart> atm the only bugbear is syntax highlight for POD6 is not as good

[03:16] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> No kidding. Huh. I wonder why mine is so slow. Itâ€™s like unusable.

[05:17] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> UE is fast and simple - even on mega files. syntax highlight, code explorer etc. are just  basic token settings and then user perl5-regex tweaks. It's a nice what-works approach, but there are some edge-cases that are not quite there - e.g. the POD6 (doc) begin/end tokens contains a space `=begin pod` and atm spaces in tokens not supported.

[09:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Da-ding!> I wrote a pretty basic subroutine to flatten nested hashes (`%( 1, %(2, %(3, 4)))` to `%( "1.2.3", 4)`) https://pastebin.com/BZ2eNVYA

[09:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Da-ding!> I'm wondering if anyone has a cool idiomatic way of doing the same thing

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean organizing an event for fixing ecosystem modules, like in the old days

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/Raku/ecosystem-unbitrot this was the original repo

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://github.com/2colours/Raku-ideas/blob/main/Squashathon%20reborn.md this is my brainstorming about how I would imagine it nowadays

[11:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> sorry to disappoint but I'm not organizing a bug squash-o-thon

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> seems like a project that big would have to be done in small chunks. Do 10 modules a week over a year.

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> not sure one event would do it

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> does raku have anything like the smoketest system perl has?

[12:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> heh, I'm not implying that you organize one, I'm saying that if there comes to be one, I'm counting on your participation

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok, i'll be there
