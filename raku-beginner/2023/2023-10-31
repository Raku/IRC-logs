[20:01] <ab5tract_> .vushu any chance you might add raygui to raku-raylib? Or perhaps a separate module?

[20:15] <ab5tract_> .vushu: also, another way to write 10.0.Num is 10.0e0. saves typing and reads more clearly imo

[20:16] <ab5tract_> In this case obviously it can just be 10e0, but Iâ€™m sure you get the point

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> <ab5tract_> ah cool thanks for the tip!, sure I have thought about making bindings for raygui at some point ðŸ™‚
