[00:06] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> Thanks Rog, I was able to proof of concept what i was trying to do via   my $date-format = rx/   $<year> = \d ** 4   '-'   $<month> = \d ** 2   '-'   $<day> = \d ** 2 /;  sub get-date($text) {   if $text ~~ $date-format { say $/<year> }; }  get-date($test-data); 

[00:06] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> Appreciate the help

[00:07] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> switching from my regex to rx/ was pivotal, I'm not sure why but I'm glad it's working for the sake of me parsing these logs in any case (:

[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> ah, if you're doing it like that now you can omit the / in $/<year> I believe

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> why it doesn't work with my regex is beyond me honestly

[04:55] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> Consider using <[0..9]> instead of \d... unless you consider 1૬３𝟞-႐٨-᧔𞥕 a valid date.

[04:56] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> (or if you know all your input is within the ASCII range, you're probably ok)

[05:14] <discord-raku-bot> <drudgesentinel> For my very simple use case I know what the input will be but I appreciate the additional consideration. There's a word case for this too isn't there? <number> or something

[06:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder what it means that it doesn't work with my regex

[22:21] <kiranraku> Hello, is it possible to declare the size of an array in the function return value signature? E.g. —> array[uint32] but let’s say restrict to 10 elements?
