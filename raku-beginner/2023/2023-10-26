[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Can I define function that takes a predefined signature value? Like I have my $sig = :(Int $a) and want sub foo to have $sig as its signature

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> is this a beginner question nowadays? ðŸ˜…

[20:09] *** stanrifkin left
[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> I'd assume so

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Doesn't everybody dynamically manipulate signature literals in all their programs? How would you, like, add two numbers without that ðŸ˜›

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> (I can move the question)

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm not aware of a "high-level Raku" solution

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> feels like there might be one but I kinda can't think of ti

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Fair 'nuff

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @.ohnowendigo - even if a bit above beginner level, I also had the same question - I found this answer on stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44093690/how-to-reuse-a-signature

[22:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (I don't think it answers the question you have directly though) ;-(

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> I just figured it's not a thing I should be trying to do

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah, there are likely some ways to do this via the MOP (Meta Object Protocol) - but that is over my head
