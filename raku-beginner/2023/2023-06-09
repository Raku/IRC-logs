[06:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It just says "loading" until eventually the webview collapses...

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> works for me

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> it's super basic todo list

[07:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a permanent "loading" screen is super basic indeed ðŸ˜›

[07:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> at least it doesn't crash on PC but it doesn't load either

[14:03] <SmokeMachine> It takes so long because itâ€™s being compiled on browserâ€¦ and thatâ€™s also very oldâ€¦ here it is: https://github.com/FCO/MemoizedDOM

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > <script type="text/perl6">

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ðŸ˜‚

[14:08] <SmokeMachine> But it could also be compiled before sent to the browserâ€¦

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @SmokeMachine Thanks for making "Test::Time" ! (https://raku.land/github:FCO/Test::Time)

[15:19] <SmokeMachine> :) I didnâ€™t remember that! :) but Iâ€™m glad you like it

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @SmokeMachine It was a crucial ingredient in convincing a client that a certain time interval specs paser-interpreter produces expected results. (E.g. based on a certain "trusted" battery of tests.)

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @SmokeMachine - this MemoizedDOM looks quite nice - but I can't quite figure out what is running where ... is this raku running in the browser? Where is the VM? How does it get installed?

[19:14] <SmokeMachine> The Raku is being compiled and is running in the browserâ€¦

[19:15] <SmokeMachine> If you  open the code in the browser youâ€™ll see the Raku code there

[19:18] <SmokeMachine> Itâ€™s using this https://webperl.zero-g.net/perl6.html

[19:22] <SmokeMachine> That uses rakudo.js and the script from 6pad

[19:25] <SmokeMachine> But it also works pre-compiled (if I remember it well) using parcel with something like this: https://github.com/perl6/perl6-parcel-example

[19:25] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: ðŸ‘†

[19:27] <SmokeMachine> I should play with that againâ€¦

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^++ that's a great explanation - tx!
