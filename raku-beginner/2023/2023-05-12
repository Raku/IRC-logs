[08:38] <habere-et-disper> OK, I'm confused. This works as expected:

[08:38] <habere-et-disper> m: say map { $_, [*] $_ }, (3,4), (5,6)

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar cd6bc2093: OUTPUT: «(((3 4) 12) ((5 6) 30))␤»

[08:38] <habere-et-disper> But then this doesn't:

[08:38] <habere-et-disper> m: say map { $_, [*] $_ }, (3,4)

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar cd6bc2093: OUTPUT: «((3 3) (4 4))␤»

[08:38] <habere-et-disper> No luck if I try and convince with:

[08:38] <habere-et-disper> m: say map { $_, [*] $_ }, (3,4).List

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar cd6bc2093: OUTPUT: «((3 3) (4 4))␤»

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> Except in prefix form:

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> m: say map { $_, [*] $_ }, List.new: (3,4)

[08:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar cd6bc2093: OUTPUT: «(((3 4) 12))␤»

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> What is going on ?!

[08:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what are you even trying to do?

[08:50] <habere-et-disper> Given a thing, return it, followed by the reduction of it (by multiplication)

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Oh

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, something.List is fundamentally different from List.new: something

[08:52] <habere-et-disper> That's new to me.

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the former is a conversion, and something that is already a List, will be converted into a List as itself

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's more or less the same reason the [] of arrays is actually idempotent

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> [[[1, 2, 3]]] is exactly the same as [1, 2, 3]

[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because at its heart, that's also a conversion, not a construction with listed elements (for the better or worse)

[08:59] <habere-et-disper> (y)

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (((3 4) 12)) 

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> its the comma that makes a list, not the parens and your map is over a List of Lists
