[07:57] <discord-raku-bot> beginner to raku, I'm expecting the code after the while to run if the last in the else is hit in the while loop. However it just seems to exit the program. Any tips would be appreciated, tried also using return.

[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> the exit unless $type would be the thing exiting the program, no?

[08:17] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> What an idiot. Apologies for wasting everyone's time...

[08:17] <discord-raku-bot> <snufkin> Thanks

[11:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lakmatiol Most of us. I was forced to be her by the historical necessity.

[11:32] <lizmat> here here !  :-)

[11:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Freudian slips by me do not count, because English is my third language...

[12:00] <lizmat> I guess I have an advantage then, as it is only my second

[12:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Is your native language Germanic? (That is another element in my excuse ... )

[12:03] <lizmat> I guess Dutch is, although not many Dutch people will admit to that  :-)

[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, English is "fringe" Germanic. But my hearing (parsing) of English rapidly improved after I started studying German.

[12:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Which package / module should I use for encoding HTTP(s) requests : "URI" or "URI::Encode" ? (Say, in "WWW::OpenAI"...)

[12:11] <lizmat> I truly have no idea

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Damn -- I have to experiment... ðŸ™‚

[12:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Since you are here I am curious -- are there any Perl-to-Raku (re-)programmers for hire? Where and how can I find them?

[12:24] <lizmat> well, I don't know about anybody else, but I have done quite a lot of that (many of the modules in https://raku.land/tags/cpan5)

[12:25] <lizmat> and I could be for hire  :-)

[12:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Great! I will make a list (with links and explanations) and contact you. (This weekend.)

[12:30] <lizmat> looking forward to it... although I won't be much online on Sun

[12:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I will keep it mind.

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> ^Z ? Hmm...

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> I'd have though ^D.

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> *thought

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> ^Z: suspend (resume with 'fg'); ^D: end of input stream (so, quits program)

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but that was Windows if I'm not wrong

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Oooh, Windows.

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and Windows likes to be weird

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Okay, carry on ðŸ™‚
