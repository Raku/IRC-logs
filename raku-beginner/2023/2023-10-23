[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Dr.Doom>  my (\l,\w) = 5,3; say (l min w,abs l - w, * - * ... *[^10]; 

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Dr.Doom> whats wrong with this ?

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Dr.Doom> :m my (\l,\w) = 5,3; say (l min w,abs l - w, * - * ... *)[^10];

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the precedence of the operations, for starters

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and the unpaired parens

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think the first line was okay

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> oh right, abs l - w, ..... is a problem

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that will eat up everything and complain about too many args provided

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the precedence wouldn't be right anyway so you should be using abs(l-w)
