[04:35] <gera> Hi. I cannot install Readline module with zef. It finds neither /usr/local/lib/libreadline.so.7 nor /lib64/libreadline.so.8 

[04:35] <gera> log: https://pst.moe/paste/qvcqsr

[04:42] <gera> I see someone in the logs recommended --/tap-harness but that does not work either

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Hello, I've never used Readline but could this be what tbrowder referred to?

[11:42] <gera> Probably, heres someone also reporting same errors as I have https://github.com/drforr/perl6-readline/issues/28

[11:43] <lizmat> could this be of significance? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/CAVEATS.md#macos

[11:49] <gera> symlinking in ~/lib did not help and its a weird location for Linux, but yeah thats maybe its looking for the dynamc library in the wrong places

[23:56] <deoac> I've installed Pod::To::HTML.  When I run 'raku --doc=HTML foo.p6', I get "===SORRY!=== Error while compiling ... Undeclared routine:

[23:56] <deoac>     gen-closure-template used at lines 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247"

[23:56] <deoac> The documentation for the module makes no mention of that routine.

[23:57] <deoac> Any ideas how I can get this module working?
