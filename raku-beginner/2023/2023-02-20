[02:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I figured everything out I was trying to do.  Thanks for the help

[02:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I'm pretty impressed after my first day back with Raku in a year.  It feels like it just does everything I could want it to do.  I imagine it's going to be a joy to use when I'm more capable

[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> why can't i import Super.raku

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> extension wrong

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> use lib "." needed

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> same problem ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Could not find Super in:     inst#/home/glot/.raku     inst#/nix/store/paigpapymi5rpv51zjnpv7xlgcym4752-rakudo-2022.02/share/perl6/site     inst#/nix/store/paigpapymi5rpv51zjnpv7xlgcym4752-rakudo-2022.02/share/perl6/vendor     inst#/nix/store/paigpapymi5rpv51zjnpv7xlgcym4752-rakudo-2022.02/share/perl6/core  

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot>   ap#     nqp#     perl5# at /home/glot/main.raku:1 

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> actually those were 2 things

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> did you do... what exactly?

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> Super.rakumod renaming, andthen use lib ".". in main.raku works, no?

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> use lib " ." comes before use Super

[11:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i get A.a called B.a called

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> ah

[12:49] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> it worked

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> im working on a module (albeit a very simple one, less than 20 lines of code)

[13:56] <lizmat> many modules are just a few lines of code, so don't worry about the size: it's how it can be used that matters  :-)

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> bruh

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> > Marks a test as passed if $got and $expected compare positively with the eq operator

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> why stringify the result ðŸ˜­

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there are other tests as well

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/is-deeply

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> ik i don't know why is has to stringify

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> rather than just compare with eqv or ===

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no idea, man xD

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> maybe just a weird design decision

[14:20] <MasterDuke> the api probably dates back to Perl

[14:24] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> is the license field required if i already have the LICENSE file

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> the docs doesn't say anything about the license field of META6.json

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <el gatito (** advocate)> i assume that it uses SPDX identifiers?
