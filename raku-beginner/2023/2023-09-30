[08:53] <gfldex> @rcmlz please note that my code required corrections, see: https://gist.github.com/gfldex/7d76fa95f620b9352e0687140da65699

[08:54] <gfldex> `start` is so slow that the decrement happend to late

[09:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I was not monitoring that - it improved the speed significantly. Thanks for pointing that out!   Benchmarking by sorting 40960 strings of size 8 - using batches of 1024 strings and 4 workers. [quicksort => 5.600979287 quicksort-parallel => 0.540380128]

[15:24] <codesections> gfldex: Yeah, I've run into that "start being slow to start" issue before.  I asked about it on StackOverflow, and jnthn recomended `.keep`ing a Promise from inside the `start` block: https://stackoverflow.com/a/69369210

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> jerome7059: suggest you take a look at Dan::Pandas - something like df.pd: '.read_parquet("test.parquet")'; will probably work

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> otherwise, please raise an issue over there and I can take a look...

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Is it normal that Raku gives me the Usage message if I pass a file that does not exist?   perl raku parse_arguments.raku --file noexist.txt Usage:   parse_arguments.raku [--file=<FilePath>] [--number=<Num>] [--flag]      --file=<FilePath>    A file to do stuff with [default: 'hello.txt']     --number=<Num>       A number for some reason [default: 8500]     --flag     

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if your interface specifies a check for it then yes

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque>  subset FilePath of Str:D where *.IO.f;  sub MAIN(     FilePath :$file = "hello.txt", #= A file to do stuff with     Num :$number = Num(8.5E3), #= A number for some reason     Bool :$flag = False #= A switch to do something ) 

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> then yes it is

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> That was the code

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the sub candidate failed, the fallback is the usage message

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Hey, I have a friend who is staring Raku. It says invites are dissabled here. How can I get him to join?

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is a public invite

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> hmmm where

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there is the invite

[20:00] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and it definitely works, I just "scammed" someone into joining

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Is it the link at the top of that #info-and-rules page you linked to?

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes ðŸ¤”

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <philippecarphin> Found it online, I'm in

[20:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what troubles one has to suffer to get an invite ðŸ¤£

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Cool! Hi Phil. That is the one I was trying to let in Nemokosch

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Phil, Nemokosch is a kind of Raku wizard. He knows a lot. Nemokosch, Phil is a reallly good Python, C, C++ programmer who likes Go and Rust too.

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <philippecarphin> I'm the one that had the question about the argument parsing with the FilePath.  I was wondering if there was a way to keep the types of MAIN's arguments as they are: perl subset FilePath of Str:D where *.IO.f;  sub MAIN(     FilePath :$file = "hello.txt", #= A file to do stuff with )  but do something so that a message gets printed if the file doesn't exist.  I reverted to doing  sub MAIN(     Str

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> :$file = "hello.txt", #= A file to do stuff with ) {     if ! $file.IO.f {          say "ERROR: The file '$file' does not exist";          exit 1;     } } 

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> hm

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to be honest, I often reverted to smartmatching to the subset, kind of a middle ground

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think there is a &*MAIN-USAGE (or some similarly named) hook

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it was GENERATE-USAGE, actually

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/language/create-cli there is plenty of stuff here, to be honest, I never delved deep into this

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the banal solution would be to make MAIN a multi and dispatch failures separately

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> @philippecarphin Kaka fa la-la!

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <philippecarphin> Ok cool thanks I'll look into that.

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> @philippecarphin Happy to see you trying out Raku.

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Team France?

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Team MontrÃ©al

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> We're in Montreal, QC.

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <philippecarphin> Oui oui, Montreal

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well technically I'm a CAE employee or something

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so Montreal is like, almost close

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> subset FilePath of Str:D where *.IO.f;  multi sub MAIN(     FilePath :$file = "hello.txt", #= A file to do stuff with ) {      say $file  }     multi sub MAIN(     Str:D :$file ) is hidden-from-USAGE {      say "ERROR: The file '$file' does not exist";  }    

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ i think that this is what you are after ?

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <philippecarphin> That's exactly what I was looking for!   Thank you very much.
