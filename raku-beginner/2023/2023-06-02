[15:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> How do you specify Whatever for CLI arguments scripts? Currently, I am using the string "Whatever" or empty string "".

[17:16] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Not sure what you mean. Something like this? sub MAIN ($a, $, $b) { $a + $b}

[17:24] *** ab5tract joined

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Something like  sub MAIN ( Str $a, :$b = Whatever, Str :$c = 3 ) { $b.isa(Whatever) a ~ b !! a ~ $b.raku ~ $c } 

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Uh, should there be a '??' before the 'a ~ b' there?

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes, of course.

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Yeah, okay. I'm still not sure what you're after, sorry :/

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It should be * instead of Whatever probably

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but no idea if that gets parsed via CLI

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @Nemokosch Yes you got what I am asking. (I never tried using "*" ðŸ˜² .)

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> Is running a MAIN subroutine a normal practice? In my admittedly trivial exercises, when I run a script with a MAIN subroutine it messes with the behavior of things like @*ARGS

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why would you use @*ARGS if you can use the signature of MAIN?

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> it was just mentioned in the exercise text itself:   Youâ€™ve already used an Array that you havenâ€™t seen. @*ARGS is the collection of Strs that youâ€™ve specified on the command line. Output each element on its own line. 

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> I ended up just using   $ cat ex6-8.raku  for @*ARGS {.say} 

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> I mostly just used it because it was mentioned as what I need to iterate over by the exercise

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> so i think a more generic application would look something like   sub MAIN (*@args) {   for @args {.say}; }  after reading the command line interface docs in raku

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> @Drudge Sentinel You'll probably find this interesting: https://docs.raku.org/routine/MAIN

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Drudge Sentinel> yep, was just reading that when I came up with the latter code
