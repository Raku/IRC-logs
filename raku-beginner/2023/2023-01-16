[04:24] <MasterDuke> Nemokosch, JsExplorerNeil: fwiw, while the jvm backend is frequently slower, there are some instances where it pulls ahead. obviously it won't win on startup time, but long running processes can have better throughput, the jvm is a pretty incredible piece of engineering

[09:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The thing is that the JVM backend is mostly lagging behind in terms of features in the first place. It's not plain unusable (like I'd say the JS backend is) but it's not really guaranteed to even provide the same functionality as the MoarVM backend

[09:09] <jaguart> can I have a list of substitutions to apply to a bunch of strings? I can't seem to get s/// to behave like a first-order thing

[09:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it really isn't a first-order thing

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you could have a list of callables that represent substitutions, probably that's the closest

[09:25] <jaguart> ok thanks

[09:26] <jaguart> I'm finding .subst a pita - it doesnt seem to work well with regex - makes me feel Perlish using s///

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why doesn't it seem to work well with regex?

[09:32] <jaguart> weird - working now... I had various incarnations of simple things like `/<-[A..Z a..z 0..9 . -]>+/`

[09:33] <jaguart> I will rework tomorrow as I prefer .subst over ~~ just for asthetics if nothing else

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I would have preferred ~~, or at least considered it

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but it got unfixed

[11:06] <Manifest0> Hi. Can someone tell me why this doesn't work? 

[11:06] <Manifest0> I have this function: sub MAIN('--option',:$p1,:$p2 where .IO.e,:@p3) {say "In!"}

[11:06] <Manifest0> I'm trying to invoke it through the command line: raku test.raku --option --p1="parameter1" --p2=./test.raku --p3="p31" --p3="p32"

[11:06] <Manifest0> But i always get the usage message. Why?

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: sub MAIN('--option',:$p1,:$p2 where .IO.e,:@p3) {say "In!"}; @*ARGS = ['--option', p1 => 'parameter1', p2 => '.', p3 => <p32 p32> ]

[11:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oops

[11:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way, from what I know, named arguments need to precede positional arguments by default

[11:19] <Manifest0> i added "myÂ %*SUB-MAIN-OPTSÂ = :named-anywhere;"

[11:19] <Manifest0> but no change in the behaviour 

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> seems like the leading dashes kill the positional parsing of a string

[11:22] <CIAvash> use :$option where :so, --option is considered an option not a string

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or Bool :$option! I suppose

[11:24] <Manifest0> CIAvash: that works :-)

[11:25] <Manifest0> so if i understood i can't use "--string" in the arguments. Got it

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure if this is intentional design or just a limitation

[11:29] <CIAvash> You can write MAIN('option', and pass option though. Like creating commands, I don't know if that's what you want

[11:31] <Manifest0> i wanted to have an uniform way of passing arguments. I didn't want to have dashed arguments and non-dashed arguments mixed. For now the :$option solution is good enough

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> I would do something like

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> ```

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> my @a = {S/a/b/}, {S/b/c/}

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> ``` for a list of substitutions

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> I'll give it a spin ðŸ™‚

[17:06] <Manifest0> i just noticed that if i add a named array as a parameter in the signature of a MAIN sub, it will change the other named scalars to array. 

[17:06] <Manifest0> Example: sub MAIN( :$option, :@tag) { say $option.WHAT;}

[17:07] <Manifest0> $ raku test.raku --option --tag=jn

[17:07] <Manifest0> (Array)

[17:07] <Manifest0> is this expected?

[17:08] <Manifest0> if i remove the :@tag from the signature i get the expected Bool

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so I'm looking at https://raku.land/cpan:CTILMES/NativeHelpers::Callback

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't think of this as a feature, that's for sure...

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> there is one version there, 0.1. And only one version in REA. This version fails to install. However, there is a version here, 0.2: https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-nativehelpers-callback/tags

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> if I clone that repo with version .2, I can install it, no problem

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> is zef just broken?

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> probably not; it's just the second version hasn't been published

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> as you can see, this distribution is published on CPAN

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not p6c (and not the "zef ecosystem" either, for that matter)

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> here is the META6.json for version .2: https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-nativehelpers-callback/blob/master/META6.json

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so you're say8ing the developer hasn't bothered to publish to anything other than cpan?

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> i guess i'm confused. the page at raku.land shows a link to github, not cpan

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I can't even find the thing on cpan

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> raku.land always shows a link to github, no?

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I don''t know. trying to make sense of all this. I don't get it.

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> why would they show a link to github if it's on cpan?

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because that's what they can access?

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> if they can access it on github, why are they not showing the latest .2 version of the module?

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because there is only one version published

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> just don't link these things together in your mind

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I don't even see it on cpan

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> where is it published?

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> it's got to be pulling it from github. if it's pulling it from github, seems like it should see version 0.2

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what do you think makes a version?

[17:36] *** dakkar left
[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in particular: is a random repository on github, and some tags in it, an ecosystem? Why would there be a workflow to act as if it was, and try to make sense of those tags as versions?

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I don't know. I just know my own workflow using mi6 which pushed out to github and creates a new version for me automaticlaly. I don't know how others do it.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> the most important thing I need to figure out is how to reliably get modules that work via zef

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> am I stuck manually cloning and the installing from the git repo?

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> well, I created an issue for this: https://github.com/CurtTilmes/raku-nativehelpers-callback/issues/4

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> hopefully module author can fix

[19:01] *** Heptite joined
[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> Maybe the meta is not updated?

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> You never had need to create a tag or such for zef to update, just the meta file

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> which ecosystem are you talking about, for starters

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> from what I can tell, all your modules still live on p6c. Stuff has changed since

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> i looked at the meta file, it say version 0.2

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> my modules? no, all of mine are uploaded via fez using mi6

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> I am still not sure why we did not use cpan in the end x)

[19:56] *** rf joined
[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> i'm going to guess it's because cpan did not have ability to track auth/ver/api

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> this guy says meta6.json is not used to determine version: https://stackoverflow.com/a/75138702/1641112

[20:07] <rf> No, I'm saying he hasn't uploaded his module in awhile. So the dist server has no idea that 0.2 exists, therefor you can't get it from zef.

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well in some sense it's "not used"

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's not like it's scanned automagically

[20:08] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> he hasn't pushed it?

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> hasn't pushed it to where? git? or the ecosystem?

[20:09] <rf> Zef.

[20:09] <rf> Or whatever hes using I think CPAN in this case

[20:10] <rf> The dist servers have no clue whats going on in Git from what I can tell. So just because its 0.2 on git does not mean it will be the 0.2 version on the dist servers

[20:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> But was zef using one repo with the list of all module repo/meta do update stuff?

[20:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> he pulled the module from cpan and moved it to GH

[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so he pushed .2 to git but not with fez.

[20:11] <rf> Git is just a service, it is not connected to Fez/Zef (I believe).

[20:12] <rf> Github I mean (git is a tool).

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this is not the p6c days anymore, after all

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> It was not zef I think for p6c?

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> yeah, how it all works is jumbled in my head. I did start out n pf6 then switch to mi6 with fez. I've never really had to think about it since because it's all just works

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> zef could fetch from p6c already

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but p6c is obsolete

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> It was panda ðŸ™‚

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> zef as well

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it can retrieve p6c to this very day actually

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and it exists for a long time

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> zef is obsolete?

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> p6c is

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> you said "sef as well"

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that was for "it was panda"

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> zef does date back to the days when p6c was the only ecosystem

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> confusingly enough

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> I think zef came when compunit was more stable

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that was still at least 5 years ago

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> All I remember is when module precomp appear x)

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> It was so annoying to change one line in a module and every module get recompiled ><

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, nowadays "the ecosystem" is not like a bunch of repositories on github

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> yeah, I think that's where I was confused. I thought zef somehow checked the meta.json file or something like that.

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> That's better x)

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so basically, the NativeHelpers::Caller module is kind of like a zombie with no home, I guess. it exists as a tarball in REA and nowhere else from the point of view of the Raku ecosystem and it still thinks it can be found on CPAN

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it can be that it can actually be found on CPAN

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> after all, REA is getting the modules from somewhere, and spoiler, not from git

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Skarsnik> You could fork and push it with fez I guess then?

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> well, only on backpan from what I could tell

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> looks like he pulled it from cpan

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> i think rea originally got it from CPAN

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> there are new modules on CPAN, too

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> like Leon's stuff

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> however, that should be disregarded because CPAN will probably be discontinued (for Raku) anyway

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for now, it's disabled in zef by default, in favor of REA entries, and REA has some cron job to fetch the modules from CPAN

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> oh really? I thought you could still do raku modules on cpan

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you could but it's not a good idea anyway

[20:24] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok, right, that's what I thought

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> how can I get this to work on the command line? `raku -e 'say qw^one two three^.join("' '")' `

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I've tried everything but I can't get those single quotes in there to print

[21:55] <jaguart> in bash: raku -e 'say qw{one two three}.join("'' ''")'

[21:55] <jaguart> od: raku -e 'say <one two three>.join("'' ''")'

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> the single quotes don't print for me

[21:57] <jaguart> oh yeah :o

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> `raku -e $'say qw^one two three^.join("\' \'")'` might do it

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> 12th thing here https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/bashchanges#quoting_expansions_substitutions_and_related

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> added $ before the opening quote

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> added escapes before singles inside

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> as the difference

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> bam! nice. thanks!

[21:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> np

[22:04] <jaguart> yay :)

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so i'm trying to migrate  installed modules from 2022.07 to 2022.12 using this suggestion: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64593189/1641112

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> so I run this command:

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> raku -e $'print "\'"; print $*REPO.repo-chain.grep(CompUnit::Repository::Installation).map(*.installed.Slip).grep(*.defined).map({ CompUnit::Repository::Distribution.new($_).Str }).join("\' \'"); print "\'"' | zef install

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> but zef throws an error

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> Usage:

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied>   zef [--fetch] [--build] [--test] [--depends] [--build-depends] [--test-depends] [--force] [--force-resolve] [--force-fetch] [--force-extract] [--force-build] [--force-test] [--force-install] [--timeout[=Int]] [--fetch-timeout[=Int]] [--extract-timeout[=Int]] [--build-timeout[=Int]] [--test-timeout[=Int]] [--install-timeout[=Int]] [--degree[=Int]] [--fetch-degree[=Int]] [--test-degree[=Int]] [--dry] [--up

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[22:08] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> not sure why I can't pipe the list of modules into zef

[22:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean... unless it's implemented, of course you can't

[22:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> have you tried passing - as the argument?

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> no. my bash/zsh skills are weak

[22:09] <jaguart> do you need the quotes?

[22:09] <jaguart> if you're piping 

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> that gets me a different error

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I tried it without quotes before, same error. So I figured I needed quotes

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm just not sure if zef install can consume the names from stdin

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's not something you'd "get for free" in processes

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok, so I guess passing data as args is different than passing in as stdin?

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> i always thought of args as stdin. guess that's wrong

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, that's different

[22:14] <jaguart> you can just add 'run "zef install " ~ at the front :)

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> yeah, i guess that's true

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, almost

[22:16] <jaguart> I'm wondering if zef dont like the empty api<> maybe?

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you'd still need to make the command produce string in-place, rather than write to stdout - but that's not difficult

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> backtick-quoting or $() would do

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> maybe I should just write a script.

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> I don't know how people whip out one-liners like they do. it always leads to confusion and frustration for me.

[22:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, what about this:

[22:19] <jaguart> on the quoting - move it into your map i.e. "\'" ~ CompUnit::Repository::Distribution.new($_).Str ~ "\'"

[22:20] <jaguart> then you can just join " "

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ```sh

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> zef install $(raku -e $'print "\'"; print $*REPO.repo-chain.grep(CompUnit::Repository::Installation).map(*.installed.Slip).grep(*.defined).map({ CompUnit::Repository::Distribution.new($_).Str }).join("\' \'"); print "\'"')

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ```

[22:20] <jaguart> and no need for leading and trailing

[22:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ok, yeah, that loosk good

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> gonna have to try after dinner. gotta run. thanks!

[22:28] <jaguart> this seems to work ok: raku -e $'my $x = "zef install -- " ~ $*REPO.repo-chain.grep(CompUnit::Repository::Installation).map(*.installed.Slip).grep(*.defined).map({ "\'" ~ CompUnit::Repository::Distribution.new($_).Str ~ "\'" }).join(" "); qqx{ $x } '

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but it turned into a nightmare on discord ðŸ˜„
