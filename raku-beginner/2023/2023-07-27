[18:21] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> i have a simple question: does it make sense to run old perl5 scripts with inline::perl, or to go all the way to raku and rewrite the scripts?

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> because, i donÂ´t get it install on windows 10 with straberry perl

[18:29] <lizmat> why would you want to change old perl5 scripts?

[18:29] <lizmat> that's the question you should be asking yourself

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to make them new ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜›

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> i know, i can run the old scripts with strawberry perl on windows, ok, but if i want to use and learn raku, it's a good idea to rewrite the scripts?

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @tanto_grs watch out, good sir, you only have 2 "super emojis" like that, use them carefully

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> or better said, sparingly

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> thx @nemokosch

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's an obscure-ish Discord Nitro feature

[18:37] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> yeah, i see, a lot of things in discord is now an nitro feature

[18:39] <lizmat> if the goal is to learn Raku, then running them with Inline::Perl5 will not achieve that goal

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> to be completely honest, I don't know many Inline::Perl5 users

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and compared to that, I have seen desperate questions and complaints

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> multiple times

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> thx, than i know, what i have to do @Raku bridge <lizmat>

[18:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so Inline::Perl5 users, it's your time to shine ^^

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> https://tenor.com/view/sports-goal-gif-26197391

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <tanto_grs> i will show my old scripts and rewrite it to raku

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> imo this is way too negative on Inline::Perl5

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  use Test::More:from<Perl5>; plan tests => 1; ok 'yes', 'looks like a Raku function'; 

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just needed a (completely straightforward zef install Inline::Perl5)

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> you may need a cheeky brew install cpanminus

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> to get the cpan perl5 module you want

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> again, I have never used it myself, I can just clearly recall that people came struggling to get something done that clearly did work in Perl, and nobody could say anything

[19:35] <lizmat> but that's the thing: people generally don't come complaining here because something just works

[19:35] <lizmat> so your test set is skewed

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> especially on the beginner channel

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes but the people who don't come can just help

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and repeatedly there was nobody

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> and to be fair, the test set pretty much must be "skewed" because the more complex the original Perl setup, all the more reason to try to use Inline::Perl5

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's not really a feat to be able to use something that you could have written in Raku in the first place just as easily
