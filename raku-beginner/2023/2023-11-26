[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am on arm_64 sonoma 14.1.1 ... I have an old x86 Mac Mini that was on 10.x and eventually bit the bullet and installed ubuntu

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve And then what happened? Come on! The suspense is killing me!!!

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well macOS is much slicker than ubuntu (and ubuntu runs a lot hotter) ... but it does a good job as a workhorse file server and runs the latest rakubrew

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and with macOS 10.x imo you are running into real security risks

[22:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hm... How so?

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Security risks with macOS 10.x ...)

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> it is unsupported by Apple / unupgradeable

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I see.

[23:58] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> I'm seeing this in some code: self.bless( value => $str ); What's that "value" there about?
