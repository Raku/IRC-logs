[08:06] <habere-et-disper> What is the expectation of the upto operator and *. For example:

[08:06] <habere-et-disper> m: my @foo = (1,2,3); say @foo[ 0 ..^ * ]

[08:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 03db26142: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3)␤»

[08:06] <habere-et-disper> I was expecting it to exlude the end point 3.

[08:13] <moritz> m: m: my @foo = (1,2,3); say @foo[ 0 .. * ]

[08:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 03db26142: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3)␤»

[08:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> 0 ..^ * is actually an infinite range starting at 0, like 0 .. * would be; excluding the infinity doesn't harm its infiniteness

[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> and therefore we get from start (0 here) until the very end

[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> https://docs.raku.org/language/list.html#Range_as_slice explains better than me

[08:15] <habere-et-disper> Thanks !

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can recall this topic on Github; maybe there is a trap entry for it or something.
