[00:14] <deoac> m: my $a=1; say $a; { let $a=2; say $a }; say $a

[00:15] <deoac> m: my $a=1; say $a; { let $a=2; dd $a }; say $a

[00:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95e0a1783: OUTPUT: «1␤Int $a = 2␤1␤»

[00:15] <deoac> Why the difference in the 3rd output?

[00:31] <rf> Have you read the let documentation?

[00:31] <rf> Refers to a variable in an outer scope whose value will be restored if the block exits unsuccessfully, implying that the block returned a defined object.

[00:31] <rf> dd returns Nil so it restores

[00:31] <rf> deoac: ^

[00:32] <rf> m: my $a=1; say $a; { let $a=2; dd $a; 123 }; say $a

[00:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95e0a1783: OUTPUT: «1␤Int $a = 2␤2␤»

[00:41] <deoac> Ah, I didn't realize dd() returned a value implying the block failed.  Thank you.

[00:42] <rf> Yeah it returns Nil, whereas say returns the gist

[01:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> lol, chatGPT isn't too bad at helping with Raku problems.

[01:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I've been having some fun

[01:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> it seems to default to wanting to use NQP

[01:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> have to ask it to stop

[17:04] <ab5tract> I feel like that should be classified as an infix operator, not a postfix 

[17:07] <rf> Yeah I think the doc is wrong

[21:15] <guifa> Alright scientific is done, although it's currently formatting just doing all digits, need to get it to respect significant digits now
