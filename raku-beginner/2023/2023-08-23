[19:52] <deoac> Is there a mailing list, chat room, or other online place to discuss the CommaIDE?

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> deoac: I don't believe there is a dedicated CommaIDE chat - what do you want to discuss?

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @deoac I think if you are a subscribe there is chat/forum at CommaIDE`s site. (At least, there was such forum one year ago.)

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this is why I ask which topic - since there may be more / cheaper help out here in the community

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> in my experience (previous Comma Complete client), the support issues are responded to in about 24 hours

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but since I have it and use it I am happy to help if I can

[20:41] <deoac> If I 'use Foo::Bar' in file Baz.raku, exported symbols from Bar.rakumod are not recognized when editing Baz.raku.  That is, in the Problems pane, the symbols are reported as 'Variable so-and-so is not declared'.  The program runs fine despite this complaint.

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Needed to generate a bunch of random 10 character strings, normally would use python or J for this, dreaded remembering the J incantation, so decided to try a Raku incantation instead. ('a'..'z').pick(10).join. Gosh I love this language

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> Just to be aware, this will never pick duplicates (which may be what you want) as pick removes the letter from the "pickable" pool (and therefore any pick value > 26 will only pick 26). If you sometimes want duplicate letters, or want to pick n+1 elems from a pool of n, use .roll instead

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_>  [1] > ('a'..'c').pick(10) (c a b) [2] > ('a'..'c').roll(10) (a a b a a c c b b a) 

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> @.ohnowendigo And as for the J incantation? I would do ?10$26 and then use that to index into the letters. Have you seen my Inline::J module?
