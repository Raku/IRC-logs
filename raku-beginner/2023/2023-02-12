[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Assume I have a grammar B that inherits a grammar A, grammar B is A {...} . How do I access parent methods of A in B? I thought something like rule TOP { <A::some-rule> } would work, but it does not seem to be the case.

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Actually, that does work, my mistake ...

[17:09] <rf> Maybe i'm drunk, but I thought "{{0}}" ~~ /"{{"\d"}}"/ would match.

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> {} within "" would be a block, no?

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh it's not within

[17:10] <rf> "{{0}}" ~~ /'{{'\d'}}'/

[17:10] <rf> Also doesn't match

[17:10] <rf> I guess that would be a block

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but the left handside is!

[17:11] <rf> Ahh yes

[17:11] <rf> '{{0}}' works

[17:11] <rf> Thanks

[17:13] <rf> Hmm I want to just capture the 0, how would I do that again?

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> () around the part to match, to register a positional capture group

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or <()> around the part to indicate that as the whole match

[17:17] <rf> m: '{{23}}' ~~ /'{{' <(+\d)> '}}'/;

[17:17] <rf> This blows up

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> why the + sign at an awkward place?

[17:18] <rf> I want to match a lot of numbers

[17:18] <rf> '{{109238190381293028}}' for example

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> \d+, not +\d

[17:19] <rf> Thank you, haven't done regex in awhile
