[22:26] <deoac> [10] > (1, 10, 100 ... Inf).infinite

[22:26] <deoac> No such method 'infinite' for invocant of type 'Seq'

[22:26] <deoac>   in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

[22:26] <deoac> [10] > (1, 10, 100 ... Inf).?infinite

[22:26] <deoac> Nil

[22:26] <deoac> ```

[22:26] <deoac> What is the meaning of `.?` ?

[22:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That missing methods will return Nil rather than throw an exception

[22:33] <deoac> Thank you.  Where is it mentioned in the docs?  I couldn't find it.
