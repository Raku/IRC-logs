[18:42] <stanrifkin> How can I stop an infinite loop within the repl? .say for 1..Inf; If I press ctrl-c two times it quits the raku repl too and I end up in the shell. Is this the normal behavior?

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yes, pretty much

[18:46] <stanrifkin> There is no way to stop and get back to the repl prompt?

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not any more than for any script

[18:47] <stanrifkin> OK
