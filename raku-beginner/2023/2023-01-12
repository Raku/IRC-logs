[00:08] <jaguart> stevied: what about: raku -MJSON::Fast -e 'my $a = qx{wget -qO- https://360.zef.pm}; my @a = from-json($a);.say for @a;'

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think the "zef ecosystem" doesn't contain everything that "counts"

[00:09] <jaguart> what about the REA archive?

[00:10] <jaguart> as in - dont all the archives return the same thing, so choose the one that has what you want

[00:11] <jaguart> stevied: what about: raku -MJSON::Fast -e 'my $a = qx{wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json}; my @a = from-json($a);.say for @a;'

[00:13] <jaguart> or just the names: raku -MJSON::Fast -e 'my $a = qx{wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json}; my @a = from-json($a);$_<dist>.say for @a;'

[00:14] <jaguart> about 2494 modules :o

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lol

[00:16] <jaguart> or - raku -MJSON::Fast -e 'my $a = qx{wget -qO- https://360.zef.pm}; my @a = from-json($a);$_<provides>.say for @a;' | grep pm6

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> tonyo just said 2493 distributions... the number is growing quickly ðŸ˜›

[00:17] <jaguart> though each version is listed, and he probably only wants the last from each dist

[00:22] <jaguart> REA reports only 850 distinct modules...

[00:23] <jaguart> using this: raku -MJSON::Fast -e 'my $a = qx{wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raku/REA/main/META.json}; my @a = from-json($a);$_<dist>.say for @a;' | sort -u -f +0 -1 -t: | wc -l

[05:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> The META.json in REA file doesnâ€™t have all the same values  as whatâ€™s in each distroâ€™s JSON files.

[05:18] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> The META.json in REA doesnâ€™t have all the same values  as whatâ€™s in each distroâ€™s JSON files.

[05:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> The only place I found where I could reliably get the location of the source code for each distro was in the distroâ€™s meta.json file in the tarball in REA.

[05:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> Complicating things is some distros donâ€™t all use the same name for the META.json file.

[05:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> So I had to extract the meta json file from each tarball.

[05:48] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> that's interesting... sounds like a recipe for confusion - so you checkout REA and work from the tarballs - and the REA/meta folder has different details from the tarball ðŸ˜®

[05:49] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> that's worth an audit check

[05:53] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart> though I do see that the REA meta has been cleaned up - e.g. the :auth fixed

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> Yeah. I was very surprised to find a lot of modules in rea meta file did not have the url to the repo. Thatâ€™s the main reason I decided to go straight to the tarballs.

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'd say it's not really official or required

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> True. But why have the url to the repo in some and not others?

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think that's also a matter of tooling

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> yeah, for sure

[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> at any rate, 99% of the modules have a a link to their public source repo

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> in some meta.json files, a lot of distros have this:

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied>    "meta-spec" : {

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied>       "url" : "http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Spec",

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied>       "version" : 2

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> ```

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> what is that?

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> can someone remind me of why I have to escape double quotes in `$m ~~ /\"/`

[17:35] *** dakkar left
[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> because regexes support string interpolation

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> more generally if it ain't an alphanumunder then escape (or single quote) it ... which is easy to remember for forgetful people like me

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ^

[18:48] <tbrowder> if all module authors would use App::Mi6 and zef that would help standardize quite a bit.

[19:02] *** Kaiepi left
[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Since the time I tried to actually add functionality to App::Mi6 and failed on the author, well, it's hard to say "sure, go ahead, everyone should use App::Mi6"
