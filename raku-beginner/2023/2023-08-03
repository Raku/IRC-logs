[07:49] <lizmat> Str is the name of the type object for strings, (Str) is a .gist representation of that type object that you e.g. get with "say":  say Str  # (Str)

[20:01] <jgaz> possibly dumb question: if I want to extract a digit from a string I used m/\d/. If I want to extract a digit, until I hit a non-digit, I use m/\d+/ but how do I extract all digits ignoring all non-digit characters?

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in your place, I would replace non-digit characters to the empty string

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the :global adverb can also help, it makes the match return all non-overlapping matches as a List

[20:03] <jgaz> Let me try that

[20:05] <jgaz> yeah m:g is close to what I want. I think I can work with it.

[20:05] <jgaz> Thanks

[23:23] <guifa_> yeah, comb is basically m:g//.  Also comb with no args is equivalent to comb(/./) so handy way to grab a list of characters

[23:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> comb produces just the string as opposed to match objects iirc

[23:25] <guifa_> ah yes that too

[23:26] <guifa_> so really, (m:g/…/)».Str
