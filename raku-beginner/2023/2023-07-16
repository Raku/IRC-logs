[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sushi: you can try a '$' anonymous state variable like this...

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> for 'xxx.txt'.IO.lines -> $line { say $++ ~ ": $line" }

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ the $ is just a state variable in the loop that ++ increments on each pass
