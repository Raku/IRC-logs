[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> lizmat: in containers vs references, the perl code says say @bar[1];. I think that should be a $

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have an "App::Rak" question:  Is this expected to work rak --find --dir .. ? (This works rak --find --dir .  .)

[20:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> looks like a bug to me

[21:33] <lizmat> yeah, looks like, please make an issue :-)

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat I might have to make more than one. But since they come from the same study, maybe, I should put them into one issue. What do you think?

[21:36] <lizmat> please make separate issues for different problems   :-)

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Ok.
