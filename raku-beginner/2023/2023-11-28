[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @lakmatiol thank you. I am using now       my $n = $IN.get;     for $IN.words -> Int(Str) $num {         $new-max += $num;         $new-max = 0 if $new-max < 0;         $max = $new-max if $max < $new-max;     }  which works also on large files (and is in total in the time range of a basic c++ solution)

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> Nice

[10:58] <ab5tract> rcmlz: great to hear that

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> lizmat: I checked how formated-Discord-input looks in https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-beginner/live.html - awfull.  I always had in mind to format them such that search engines might be able to use it (like in StackOverflow or Mailman-Archives.  But I guess that is not what Discord is made for ...  What is the best way of formating questions such that they are readable in booth, IRC and Discord and are

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> Searchengine-searchable?

[13:04] <lizmat> wrt the readable part: people usually make a gist and refer to that in their query

[13:05] <lizmat> this has the advantage of correct formatting, and keeping the channel less noisy

[13:06] <lizmat> re search-engine searchable: I think that if a gist is marked as "private", good search engines will not index it

[13:06] <lizmat> so if you want it to be searchable, I guess it needs to be a public gist

[13:06] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> OK, then it is also important not not delete gist and keep it public. Do we expect search engines to index the Raku channels?

[13:11] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Funny, duckduckgo/bing already indexed yesterdays talk ("site:.irclogs.raku.org max-subarray-sum"), whereas google.com did not

[13:17] <lizmat> cool

[13:17] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz One year ago a made some study of the Raku IRC logs: how many messages/people, how many messages per handle, Pareto principle, etc. It was hard to ingest and parse the I%C logs data in Raku.

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I never published that study, only discussing it here. I guess I will wrap it up in some good enough form, and proclaim itâ€¦

[14:08] <DarthGandalf> antononcube: by I%C you meant misspelled IRC?
