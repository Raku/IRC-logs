[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> Technically File::Stat is an updated module, I migrated it to from cpan to zef... but I did add support for lstat and improve the documentation substantially, so it feels like a new module! ðŸ˜€

[18:25] <wafflus> is it possible to use map and get access to the entire map it's self without storing the map in a sperate variable? https://pastebin.com/YedU4VqY

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think so. Of course this is not a counterproof.

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Something to consider is that map returns a sequence and it's lazily evaluated

[18:28] <wafflus> k :(

[19:06] <wafflus> can i format a list to a string without spaces in it ?

[19:07] <wafflus> when i use.fmt it has spaces in it and i need to replace or splitÂ  and join the array

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> could you give an example?

[19:15] <wafflus> <pie apple cake>.fmt("%s\n")

[19:16] <wafflus> the apple and cake are idented

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/type/List#method_fmt

[19:18] <wafflus> method fmt($format = '%s', $separator = ' ' --> Str:D) this looks interesting but i'm not sure how to write it

[19:18] <wafflus> i find the manual pretty noob unfreindly tbh

[19:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's the signature of the method

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> there are two parameters, the first one is the format and it defaults to '%s', the second one is the separator of the elements and it defaults to ' '

[19:21] <wafflus> oh ok ty

[19:22] <wafflus> whatsÂ  a STR:D what the d part?

[19:24] <wafflus> i also dont get the defaults to %s

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> not sure what's the problem with that

[19:26] <wafflus> is it default argument only works with no arguments

[19:26] <wafflus> ?

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's the value to be used when you don't pass a value for that argument

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> have you not used other languages?

[19:29] <wafflus> how do i pass a value to only the 2nd argument and keep the dafault argument for the first?

[19:29] <wafflus> yes i have

[19:29] <wafflus> used ohter languages

[19:32] <wafflus> raku is probably one of the hardest to learn no offence

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think there is a way to do that

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> thinking of C++, Python, Javascript, C#, I think they work identically with regards to this

[19:34] <wafflus> k is there some sort of syntax on the manual pages that explains that both arguments are required or no arguments?

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> that's not true in any of these languages, Raku included

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> you just can't skip the first one

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> but it's perfectly fine to omit the second one and only define the first

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> so to summarize, here you can either pass in both, or the first, or none

[19:44] <wafflus> ok i thought that was the case i thought maybe the manual might have some styling that could show that

[19:45] <wafflus> i take it thats always the case (but maybe not for named arguments?)

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> named arguments have no ordering at all

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> they won't get passed as an nth argument, you can only specify them by name

[19:49] <wafflus> in powershell it would put optional arguments in [] and give you multiple signatures so It easier to understand at a glance

[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/language/functions

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, I was thinking and Python also works a bit differently

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in Raku, the concept of default values and the concept of named parameters are completely orthogonal

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> named (versus positional) parameters are about the way you can feed arguments into the function

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the default values are values that get used if you didn't feed a value in, regardless the way it needs to be fed in

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> for a simple positional parameter, the caller side doesn't care about the name of the parameter; it is not exposed

[19:56] <wafflus> okÂ  is there a reason why it mentions the name of the positional paramaters? on the documentation

[19:56] <wafflus> just wondering

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't think there is an "interface" reason. I think it's because of how the signatures have been obtained, plus it's easier to describe what the function does if you don't have to always say "the first argument ...", "the second argument ..."

[20:01] <wafflus> ok ty very much

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> no problem

[20:12] <wafflus> is there a smaller version ofÂ  manual page that just list the methods on a class/object instead of having to scroll through a big long page?

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> isn't that more or less the "table of contents" on the left?

[20:20] <wafflus> a breif explanation of that use method does would be nice I dopn't think I would ever guess what ord does

[20:21] <wafflus> I was trying to find raku equivalent to JavaScript charCodeAt() i ended up having to use Ai

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what is charCodeAt?

[20:24] <wafflus> "A".CharCodeAt() == 65

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> It was Ord in Pascal as well fwiw

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> maybe in Python as well, couldn't say for 100%

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> Shouldnâ€™t the separator be a named parameter there?

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> (I men the .fmt)

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> normative or descriptive?

[20:28] *** deoac joined
[20:30] <SmokeMachine> I mean wouldnâ€™t it be more useful if the signature was `method fmt($format = '%s', :$separator = ' ' --> Str:D)` (note the : before the $separator)

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> perhaps it would
