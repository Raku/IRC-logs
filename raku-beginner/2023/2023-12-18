[18:33] <DarthGandalf> Hi, what's the best way to insert a row into a 2d array? When I'm doing @map.splice($index, 0, @map[$index]), it insists on flattening the row to multiple elements, even if I wrap it in [[[]]]

[18:33] <DarthGandalf> I found a way: @map.splice($index, 0, 0); @map[$index] = @map[$index+1];

[18:33] <DarthGandalf> but that looks awkward

[18:36] <DarthGandalf> actually, it shoudl be @map[$i] = @map[$i+1].Array, otherwise they are apparently shared; but the point of a weird dummy parameter in splice still stands

[19:21] <lizmat> DarthGandalf: and with @map.splice($index, 0, $@map[$index]) ???

[19:37] <lizmat> m: my @a = 1,2,3; my @b = <a b c>; dd @a.splice(1,0,$@b); dd @a  

[19:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar af27c2f6b: OUTPUT: «Array @a = []␤Array @a = [1, "a", "b", "c", 2, 3]␤»

[19:37] <lizmat> hmmm that feels like a deficiency in .splice

[19:43] <lizmat> DarthGandalf: could you please make an issue for this?

[19:44] <lizmat> It won't get fixed before the 2023.12 release (too risky with possible ecosystem fallout), but the issue should not fall through the cracks

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> m: my @a = [[12, 3], [4, 5]]; @a.splice(1, 0, [@a[1].clone,]); @a1++; say @a

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  [[12 3] [4 5 1] [4 5]] 

[21:35] <DarthGandalf> lizmat: done, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5500

[21:36] <DarthGandalf> Nahita: how does '1' appear in the second row there?

[21:37] <DarthGandalf> and @a1 in your code is not even an existing variable

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> what are you talking about? is this a bridge fault again?

[21:37] <DarthGandalf> erm. Could be?

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> yeah it apparently is

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> @a[1][2]++ @a1++

[21:38] <DarthGandalf> I literally see this (I wonder if bridge bridges it correctly): `m: my @a = [[12, 3], [4, 5]]; @a.splice(1, 0, [@a[1].clone,]); @a1++; say @a <Raku eval>  [[12 3] [4 5 1] [4 5]] `

[21:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> the difference between my two expressions is the presence of backticks

[21:39] <DarthGandalf> I see

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> 13[6, 'asd']

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder what happens XD

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> actually, it was [1][2][3][4, 5][6, 'asd']

[21:40] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> well, good to know at least...
