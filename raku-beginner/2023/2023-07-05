[00:35] <deoac> I just installed rakudo-star, but am having trouble with zef:

[08:39] <habere-et-disper> If a grammar token matches, how do I programatically reference the name of the matching token? I can't seem to find it in the match object. Thanks !

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> How do you invoke the grammar?

[09:28] <habere-et-disper> With .parse

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> I have a bunch of abbreviations that I'm wanting the grammar to expand.

[09:29] <habere-et-disper> The tokens match fine.

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't quite remember but grammars produce match objects on the way, like regexes

[09:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> These are hierarchical match objects that contain the tokens/regexes/rules

[09:32] <habere-et-disper> How to inspect/traverse the match tree ? I tried ^name on token.

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> A Match object can be taken as a hash, e.g by calling the .hash method on it

[09:39] <habere-et-disper> Aha

[09:39] <habere-et-disper> :)
