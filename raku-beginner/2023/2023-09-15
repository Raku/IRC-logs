[18:04] <jgaz> How do I extend a physical line of code along multiple logical lines? The usual trick of `code... code... code \[newline] more code...` seems not to work in Raku.

[18:05] <lizmat> jgaz: an unspace should work... could you gist an example?

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> in general, adding whitespace often won't work, as in, it changes the parsing

[18:06] <jgaz> let me cook up a minimal example.

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'd say it doesn't have to be minimal for now

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it's more a principle than an unexpected bug so probably we can manage ðŸ˜›

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jgaz Yeah, as no need for minimal -- just do not just cook it, but also gist it.

[18:09] <jgaz> I just tried it with a basic `say $x ~\[newline]$y` and it worked. I must have had some trailing whitespace or something the last few times I tried it. NM. My bad.

[18:09] <jgaz> I swear, "idiot" is not my middle name. XD

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> no, it's okay. There are definitely situations where you can't add whitespace and you could in some other language

[19:18] <gfldex> Raku made me activate Â¶ in vim.
