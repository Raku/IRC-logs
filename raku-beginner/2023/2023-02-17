[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> I'm calling this on a list which may or may not have an even number of elements: .map:{$^a~$^b~' '}. Is there a way I can tell it a fallback value for $^b in case there is an odd number?

[18:50] *** MasterDuke joined
[18:54] <rf> One sec nHail I think I did this exact thing once

[19:03] <rf> I did this with .map: sub ($a, $b = 'fallback') { $a ~ $b };

[19:03] <rf> nHail: ^

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Ah, thanks.

[19:04] <lizmat> -> $a, $b? { ... }

[19:04] <rf> ^ that is nicer!

[19:04] <lizmat> doesn't need to be a sub

[19:04] <lizmat> although a default may be better if you're concatenating

[19:04] <lizmat> -> $a, $b = '' { ... }

[19:05] <rf>  -> $a, $b? { $a ~ ($b // 'abc') };

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Tried this, says $a is not defined

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> might be something else though

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Got it now, thanks!

[20:01] <rf> Awesome!
