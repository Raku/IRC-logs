[06:54] <wafflus> i'm messing aroud doing some perl6 regex does anyone know how to do this in perl6 \b\w{4,9}\b? I tried doing what i thought was the perl6 way but i got weird results

[08:19] *** Wsun joined
[08:19] <lizmat> wafflus: this channel is about the Raku Programming Language  :-)

[08:20] <wafflus> =L

[08:20] <lizmat> word boundary: https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Word_boundary

[08:21] <lizmat> quantifiers: https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#General_quantifier:_**_min..max

[08:21] <wafflus> i know what a word boundry and quantifier is i just wanted to compare my sollution and see if i was doing it wrong

[08:22] <wafflus> but ty

[08:22] <wafflus> thankyou anyways

[08:23] <lizmat> "weird results" doesn't help in answering a question

[08:23] <lizmat> if you provide a gist with what you did, and what you expected, then maybe someone will be able to provide an answer

[08:25] <wafflus> well the point was to see what people came up with and see if it was different and then see if there sollution was different and had the same problems as mine and if it did i was going to post more ingo

[08:25] <wafflus> i think i fixed it anyways :)

[08:28] <wafflus> i think i have more problems learning the rules of raku than the rules of regex atm :P

[08:45] <CIAvash> `«\w ** 4..9»` or `<|w> \w ** 4..9 <|w>` as lizmat's links explain. But I'm not sure word boundaries are doing anything here, since you're matching only word characters(\w)

[08:46] <CIAvash> Well Raku's regex is not compatible with regex of other programming languages, so you need to learn Raku's regex

[08:46] <wafflus> ty i can see now there is a difference between <|w> and using <<>> <|w> seems to delete the last characters

[08:46] <wafflus> i am learnuing but <|w> dnt seem to behave like \b

[08:50] <CIAvash> can you give us an example?

[08:51] <wafflus> maybe i misread but according to the mnaual To match any word boundary, use <|w> or <?wb> however they give different results

[08:51] <wafflus> i can post the file i was testing on

[08:54] <wafflus> perl6 -ne 'say $/ if $_ ~~ m/<|wb>\w ** 3..8 <|wb>/' filelocation

[08:55] <lizmat> wafflus: OOC, which version of Raku are you using ?

[08:55] <wafflus> This is Rakudo version 2019.11 built on MoarVM version 2019.11

[08:55] <wafflus> implementing Perl 6.d.

[08:56] *** Wsun left
[08:59] <lizmat> wafflus: that's.... pretty old...   you might want considering upgrading to at least 2023.04, 2023.05 if you're not on Windows

[08:59] <wafflus> i'm on windows but that was from the wsl2 version inside windows

[09:00] <wafflus> the windows one is Welcome to RakudoΓäó v2023.04.

[09:00] <wafflus> Implementing the Raku┬« Programming Language v6.d.

[09:00] <wafflus> Built on MoarVM version 2023.04.

[09:00] <wafflus> but as u can see the unicode does not work and i can't figure out how to get it to work

[09:01] <lizmat> ah, it still thinks it's not on Windows then

[09:02] <wafflus> any ideas what to do atm i have to go though wsl and rlwrap

[09:02] <lizmat> ┬« is mojibake for ™

[09:02] <wafflus> ah cool :) it does kind of make the output a little unreadable though

[09:03] <lizmat> yeah, that's why it does (tm) on Windows

[09:03] <lizmat> the  fact that it doesn't, seems to indicate it thinks it's not on Windows

[09:03] <wafflus> i tried both rakudostar and rakubrew both seem to have the same problem from what i remember

[09:05] <wafflus> and btw i can't even input unicode i get diamonds with question marks in them

[09:05] <wafflus> usign windows version that is

[09:05] <lizmat> https://5ab5traction5.bearblog.dev/fixing-raku-unicode-display-issues-windows/

[09:06] <lizmat> can be of use perhaps

[09:08] <wafflus> ty tried chcp 65001 doesn't seem to work i'll guess i can try the registry version but that requires a restart

[09:08] <lizmat> I guess I've run out of suggestions then  :-(

[09:09] <wafflus> np the linked page also seems to have more sollutions i can try

[09:09] <wafflus> so you think the <|w> is a bug and not behaving correctly

[09:09] <wafflus> ?

[09:11] <wafflus> anyways ty for your help it seems your a bit of a legend round here lizmat

[09:11] <wafflus> around

[09:12] <lizmat> so they say...  :-)

[09:12] <lizmat> and you're welcome!

[09:15] <wafflus> always appreciate someone who at least tries to help i will try installing a different raku version see if it changes the word boundry strangness and i will also try those windows fixes

[09:16] <lizmat> thanks, and please don't hesitate to make an issue if you think something's wrong

[09:16] <lizmat> if there's not, then there's a good chance either the documentation is wrong or unclear, and need fixing

[09:17] <CIAvash> You still didn't say what get from elsewhere and what you get with Raku's regex. Using your test file I get the same results

[09:17] <wafflus> maybe i'm just cursed

[09:18] <wafflus> sec i can post output

[09:19] <wafflus> i'm just installing a diffrent version so i'm retesting it

[09:25] <wafflus> ah it seems i made a typo CIAvash

[09:26] <wafflus> i was uing <|wb>

[09:29] <wafflus> if you use <wb> then you get efresher｣ or [refreshe]

[09:29] <wafflus> if you use <|wb> then you get efresher｣ or [refreshe]

[09:30] <wafflus> obviosully i made a mistake though still dont fully understand what is happening there

[09:34] <wafflus> i'm guess they just count as some kind of blank regex
