[07:52] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Question to Comma IDE:  Situation: I have a "local playground" project in Comma, where I keep track of the dependencies in a META6.json  Every time I upgrade my Raku (using rakubrew) I install all dependencies using zef manually.   However, in the settings of all projects I see the option "Project Packet Manager", which I point to "zef" in e.g.

[07:52] <discord-raku-bot> /Users/rcmlz/.rakubrew/versions/moar-2023.04/share/perl6/site/bin/zef  Problem: I can not find the button in Comma that installs all dependencies I list in META6.json.  How do I make Comma use the information in the META6.json of a local project to install all the dependencies automatically?  Thank you.

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I have written an email to info@commaide.com - perhaps they know the solution and can help. I will let you know if there is one ...

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Ups, I did not follow the good old "did you switch in on/off-advice" before posting here. After restarting Comma there is a pop-up asking if I like to install the missing dependencies.

[08:52] <lizmat> *phew*  :-)

[13:38] <habere-et-disper> Are `not $foo %% $bar` and `$foo !%% $bar` equivalent enough that I'm not going to run into trouble using either?

[13:41] <habere-et-disper> Aside: I got some more dependency issues compiling 2023-04. Does it warrant another issue?

[13:46] <habere-et-disper> CIAvash: is it doable to have chroma handle greater granularity with raku's hyper operator? I'm finding ligation is an issue with it. See: https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/issues/1391#issuecomment-1513203097

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Good to know. I have to say I am not familiar with the text/code highlighting frameworks.

[14:04] <habere-et-disper> @Anton Antonov: I've found chroma to have the best raku support.

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Just highlighting?

[14:13] <habere-et-disper> Yes - syntax highlighting

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Meh. ðŸ™‚

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok, I will try to see can I incorporate it in the exports of "Markdown::Grammar".

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> From that perspective, JavaScript highlighters are prefrable.

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what data format does Chroma even use?

[14:32] *** Heptite left
[14:33] <habere-et-disper> I think ask CIAvash. Output appears to be: json, html & svg

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I assumed -- or read -- that HTML is the output. Hence, in principle, it can be a plug-in for "Markdown::Actions::HTML".

[14:58] <habere-et-disper> The HTML output appears most flexible as you get custom stylesheets which can be modified to suit.

[14:59] <habere-et-disper> (Latex output appears under consideration. )

[15:01] *** Heptite joined
[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm more interested in the input, as in, how do you define the grammar

[15:04] <habere-et-disper> Chrom'a raku lexer is in go

[15:04] <habere-et-disper> https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/blob/master/lexers/raku.go

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well well, that's the opposite of portable then
