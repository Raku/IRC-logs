[09:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Poohmaan: it looks that the count-and-sum-evens example here is close to what you are asking https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_reduce

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> which can be simplified if you only want the acc part and not the count

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub fun(\acc, \x) { acc+x }; say (1..10).reduce: &fun;

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  55 

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (1..10).reduce: -> \acc, \x {acc+x};

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  55 

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (1..10).reduce: {$^acc + $^x};

[10:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  55
