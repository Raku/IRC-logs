[01:37] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> I have a Point module available that supports math ops between points I did think about adding a distance method, but didn't want to assume which distance people want.

[09:41] <ab5tract> _elcaro_: one option is create a named paramete that allows the user to specify their preference while also allowing a default

[09:43] <ab5tract> another would be to make it a multi method and then they specify their preference a little more succinctly

[09:45] <ab5tract> m: multi sub f() { "default" }; multi sub f(:$choice!) { "you've chosen" }; dd f(); dd f(:choice)

[09:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar bd43800b1: OUTPUT: «"default"␤"you've chosen"␤»
