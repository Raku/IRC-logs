[01:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "Slice it" might be a more appropriate term. (Although, some people do crush onions.)

[02:08] <deoac> Is it possible to interpolate variables in POD6?

[02:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't think it has that feature natively

[02:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @deoac I think you looking for some kind of feature that is "Text::CodeProcessing". That module evaluates Pod6 code blocks. So, it can be used to interpolate variables.

[03:50] <kitsunegari> im trying to remove a set of words from a file full of song titles, using substitution. the code template this class has me using says specifically to use substitution and also both g and i directives on it, but it wont let me run that because it says ig is an invalid directive for substitution. am i missing something?

[03:57] <kjp> You need to specify each option separately. Try s:i:g/...

[04:02] <kitsunegari> that fixed it, yes
