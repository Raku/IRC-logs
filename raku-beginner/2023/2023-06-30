[00:57] <discord-raku-bot> <_elcaro_> I always thought min and max on a Range was similar to Range.bounds.  I'm also reminded of a time I was dealing with ranges where I had to do something along the lines of...  my ($min, $max) = (.min + .excludes-min, .max - .excludes-max) given $range

[00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I think if Ranges are conceptually continuous (which they seem to be - nothing special about integer bounds), the only sane choice is to report the bounds back

[08:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I don't know if I miss something important or this is really just a description of a usual garbage collected environment

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> bbrtj: good question ... I note that there is a test operator for this https://docs.raku.org/routine/request-garbage-collection , so you could experiment by making a mega hash, going out of lexical scope and then calling that

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my guess is that raku GC will apply to all raku objects and that a Hash is an object like any other (but I would defer to someone who knows the facts)

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I agree - this is what .bounds does

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Should minmax do the same as bounds - well I think the current minmax handles excluded ends in the expected way and fails if not is-int

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (2..^9).minmax

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (2 8) 

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (2..^9.3).minmax

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Cannot return minmax on Range with excluded ends   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (2..^9.3).bounds

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (2 9.3) 

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> So I would say that the right thing is to make min and max follow the same logic as minmax

[12:32] <lizmat> which is what https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5300 does, right ?

[13:01] <habere-et-disper> Is something blocking the 2023.06 star release ?

[13:01] <habere-et-disper> This link points to 2023.05-01 still :

[13:01] <habere-et-disper> https://rakudo.org/latest/star/src

[13:03] <lizmat> I thought the Star release was already done?

[13:03] <lizmat> suggest making an issue so we can figure out where it went wrong

[13:04] <habere-et-disper> üëç

[13:12] <habere-et-disper> Done. https://github.com/rakudo/star/issues/187

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> nope

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say minmax (2..^9)

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  2..8 

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say max (2..^9)

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  8 

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say minmax (2..^9.3)

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  2..9 

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (2..^9.3).minmax

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Cannot return minmax on Range with excluded ends   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> weird, the sub version of minmax ought to fail

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say max (2..^9.3)

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  9 

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say (2..^9.3).max

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  9.3 

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and both the above max should fail imo

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anywho - I will try to take this thread over to the PR comment...
