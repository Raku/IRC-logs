[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Cool, thanks

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> This is the full program I was working on, it's just a simple brute force checker for cases in Hensel's Lemma, finding solutions to polynomials in modular arithmetic

[19:09] <ab5tract_> nhail: nice! I'm not familiar with Hensel's Lemma but your code is nicely readable

[19:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Damn, Gretelâ€™s theorem was omitted! Again...

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> XDD

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> ab5tract if you want context, it's a thing in number theory which states that if you have a solution to a polynomial mod p for a prime p, you can under certain circumstances "lift" that solution to another solution mod p^2.   and if you can lift once, you can lift again. so you get a series of numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, etc. such that a_n is a solution to the polynomial for p^n.

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> Wikipedia might have better information

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <nhail> my code is just directly checking for a specific p^m, and whether any of the solutions there can be lifted to p^(m+1)
