[08:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> DarthGandalf: hi, my original message was my @a = [[12, 3], [4, 5]]; @a.splice(1, 0, [@a[1].clone,]); @a[1][2]++; say @a; the essence of it is passing [@stuff,] with comma-trailed to splice. clone is so it's not shared, and ++ is to prove it's not shared

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> trailing comma is needed because otherwise [...] calls .Array, on ... (even if it doesn't explicitly call it, the end effect is the same from what I have seen)

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> it's kind of surprising actually, i stumbled upon this recently:

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> m: [%(3, 4, 5, 6)].raku.say

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  ["3" => 4, "5" => 6] 

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> isn't a 1-length array with the Hash, rather the Hash is spread to its pairs

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> therefore, like in the bare parens case with 1 elem in it ($thing,) where "," must be there, in square brackets, for predictability for amateurs like me, "," must be there as well unless other interpretation is specifically needed

[08:49] <DarthGandalf> ah, I see, thanks

[08:49] <DarthGandalf> that's surprising :(

[08:50] <DarthGandalf> $@foo still should have worked though, as it doesn't use the [] syntax

[09:22] <lizmat> DarthGandalf: yeah, I think *that* is the bug

[10:48] <DarthGandalf> lizmat: perhaps it would be good to have some warning about [@foo]?

[10:50] <lizmat> in what way?

[10:51] <DarthGandalf> like, a linter

[10:51] <DarthGandalf> or compiler warning

[10:51] <DarthGandalf> I tried to use that syntax when trying to make it work, and a warning would advice to add , there

[10:52] <DarthGandalf> since [@foo] by itself is not very useful, trying to convert an array to an array

[10:53] <lizmat> I think in RakuAST we would be able to add a worry

[10:54] <lizmat> OTOH, [@a] is a valid way to create a clone of an array

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Yeah this is design... "seemed like a good idea at first"

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Also means that wrapping is idempotent

[11:07] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> [[$x]] and [$x] are the same
