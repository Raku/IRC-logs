[00:10] <deoac> What is the keyboard shortcut to give focus to the search box on docs.raku.org?

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there such a keyboard shortcut?

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can't recall any keyboard shortcuts on the site but if you know one, that would help chase down where they might be defined

[00:30] <rf> There should be

[00:31] <rf> deoac: Press tab 5 times

[00:34] *** NemokoschKiwi left
[00:37] <deoac> Yeah, that works.  But there should be a dedicated keystroke shortcut, IMHO.

[03:30] <shmup> why is here a \n before the o in hello?

[22:01] <ToddAndMargo> Question on the BEGIN routine.    If I put and "exit" in the BEGIN routine, will it just exit the routine or will it exit everything, including what is left to be compiled?

[22:14] <rf> It will exit everything

[22:14] <rf> exit is kills the program iirc

[22:15] <rf> m: { BEGIN { say 123; exit 0; }; say 'yipeee'; }

[22:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar b721f0a04: OUTPUT: «123␤»

[22:41] <ToddAndMargo> thank you!

[22:41] <ToddAndMargo> will it stop compiling?

[22:42] <rf> Raku is not compiled

[22:42] <rf> The program will stop when it sees exit, regardless of where it is

[22:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Raku is somewhat compiled - there is a precompilation step, that's how the "compile-time" terminology entered

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> But iirc it's only observable for modules for the time being

[22:49] <lizmat> and installed scripts

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Raku isn't compiled by default, but is there a full raku compiler?

[23:53] *** Heptite left
[23:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think there might have been at some point but it was always rather experimental stuff
