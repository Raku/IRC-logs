[00:11] <DarthGandalf> oh, and another way of inheriting mentioned in the doc (Inline::Perl5::Perl5Parent) even refuses to compile: Invalid typename 'Inline::Perl5::Perl5Parent'

[12:56] <lizmat> It's advent calendar time again: https://raku-advent.blog

[17:09] <ab5tract> DarthGandalf: sorry you keep hitting bugs :(

[17:10] <ab5tract> can you report the `Inline::Perl5` issues to the project repo?

[17:25] <DarthGandalf> sure!

[17:25] <DarthGandalf> the .pm warning I mentioned is in rakudo itself, not in Inline::Perl5

[17:25] <DarthGandalf> but other issues are

[17:54] <ab5tract> yeah, there's a Rakudo bug in the "pm" handling for sure. I don't know whether anyone considered mixed Perl/Raku codebases when that was implemented

[17:55] <ab5tract> I doubt this will have an effect, but it would be cool if `use v5.32` or whatever would disable this check

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> looks like that's a bad check period to me

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> @abstract you can proably use this font https://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=flakes to the snow simulator flakes

[20:20] <ab5tract> that's an interesting thought...

[20:21] <ab5tract> I would prefer to do it through loading the unicode snow characters in raylib, but it's cool to have the option.

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> got unicode,

[20:25] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1180243383453745173/Screenshot_from_2023-12-01_21-25-31.png?ex=657cb64e&is=656a414e&hm=1cb1c88eb5e6655bd0e304157898284348d0f2be5e624deca604f7b528b22468&

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I came across this https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/1095 It seems like that the font you wan't must contain the unicode, if it doesn't i will just show [] or ?

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I tried to render the snow flake unicode, but failed to find a font that has the snow flake

[20:40] <ab5tract> ah really? I think its in Deja Vu Sans at least, for sure its in noto emoji

[20:43] <ab5tract> or at least, I would have expected :S

[20:56] <ab5tract> .vushu did you get the unicode working the same way as you mentioned you got 'abstract' working?

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> I will upload an example

[21:20] <ab5tract> thanks!

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> Ab5tract here is a simple example https://github.com/vushu/raylib-raku/blob/main/examples/draw-unicode-text.raku I believe that .ttf are barely supported according to my testing and according to this https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib/comments/122se4y/raylib_cant_display_unicode_characters/

[23:16] <ab5tract> Ah, great, thanks

[23:17] <ab5tract> Regarding .fnt, I saw that the current tooling for creating them is not very straightforward. thought it might make for a cool Raku one, actually.

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> yeah would be a nice thing to make I think I use this java tool at some point in time https://libgdx.com/wiki/tools/hiero

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @vushu did you work on chess position images rendering?
