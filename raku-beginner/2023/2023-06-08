[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> SO pretty much no other option ?

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> Unless i'll do some embedding shenanigans ig there is no way

[18:43] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> What kind of project do you have and what kind of environment are you trying to run it in?

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I'm a bit of an optimist in this regard. This approach was not really available 10+ years ago so it's an improvement across the board. And there's a lot less demand for desktop applications these days due to the browser continuing to eat the world

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> I want to make simple shell, but it would be nice to have it standalone

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> shell itself is not standalone if you think about it ðŸ˜›

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> I mean you're not wrong haha

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> Also you could argue that modern webbrowsers are more closer to be small operating systems

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I would agree with that.

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> At the least, they're application runtimes.

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay but let's be fair: realistically, you cannot run Raku in he browser

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> *the

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> well

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> No, but you can run a backend service running in raku, and connect from a browser.

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> all depends on time and skills

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> ðŸ˜”

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> I love raku

[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> yeah Cro lib comes to mind

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I do wonder how hard it would be to make a C program and pack MoarVM/nqp/rakudo and your app. We have a Perl 5 module that embeds Raku, why not standalone.

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> That said, I know it's all in the details about being able to package your dependent modules, run on different OSes, etc

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> i'm actually pondering about shoving whole rakudo inside of C++

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> isn't impossible, but deffo pain

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> might as well not be worth the hassle

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Depends on your goals.

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> I mean yeah, i'm just hobbyist so it would probs be outside of my scope anyways

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Okay, alternate idea: jvm backend, put all the dependents in a jar, use whatever java strategies to make that runnable

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the so-called "jvm backend" is also not standalone, mind you

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> haven't tried JVM back yet

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's not much different from MoarVM, except with a misleading name

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> dang

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Hmm. It's been years since I used the jvm backend for much, and even more years since I wrote useful java, but can't you basically get it to java -jar literallyEverythingInOneFile.jar?

[18:54] *** deoac joined
[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know about that; my point is that you need to ship the runtime some way, and I don't mean the Java runtime

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> yeaha that's the issue

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> You need to ship the whole runtime

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's really the same situation as with MoarVM

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> python have freeze

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> etc

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> lua can be shoved everywhere

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> If freeze is good enough, then just use a docker image and a strategy like whalebrew: https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> okay this is getting more interesting now

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I'm biased, and I worked with the folks who made that experiment, but it's viable. Definitely easier than writing your own packer/unpacker

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> yeah

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Yes, you then require docker. But I assume that the goal isn't "fully standalone" but rather "small set of dependencies that makes it easy to install and keep contained"

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> yeah that sounds about right

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> If you truly want fully standalone, you'd want "actually portable executables" https://justine.lol/ape.html

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Or a Linux Live USB image.

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> oh my god

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> that is so cool and cursed at the same time

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> thank you for your contribution

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> :cameliathink:

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Or an OVA file for VMware, virtual box, hyper-v, etc. But that doesn't sound like your domain

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I'm starting to question my career choices, due to the fact that I know about all these things and have used about half in production

[19:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> Hey it's never too late to pursue what do you trully enjoy

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> for example i know that without any former education i can't get any job in industry. but i'm trying to penetrate through(no pun intended)

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I actually like this stuff. I probably should question my sanity instead ðŸ™ƒ

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> oof

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> I should blog about whalebrew and raku, or something along those lines.

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> Yeah you should

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Ad Meliora> I mean in general you seem very knowledable. Would be sad if that wouldn't be passed further along

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Thanks, that's quite the compliment. I'll see what I can do before the next Raku weekly.
