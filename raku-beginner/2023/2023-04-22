[15:53] <lucs> Meep/test

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> bridge test

[15:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> yup, works

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> @Zephyr Thanks.

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> np

[15:58] <lizmat> discord-raku-bot: welcome back, sorry for my unwarranted ban

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> it was rather unexpected, would you prefer if we bridged raku-steeering-council perhaps and made it moderator-only on the Discord side? since I presume having a channel of communication would make things more convenient

[16:02] <lizmat> yes, that would be very helpful indeed

[16:02] <lizmat> from my pov, the difficulty is really not being able to privmsg people on the discord side

[16:03] <lizmat> if we could find a way to do that as well, that would be great

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> hmm, maybe I should look into both bridging that channel and then figuring out a way to make privmsg work over the bridge. I'll be afk for a bit rn though, gotta go grab dinner

[16:04] <lizmat> ok, thanks so far!

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> What happened today was a strange anomaly, probably not something that will happen often.

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> although I presume the latter would require a custom implementation

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> since I didn't notice anything of the bridge that allows for something like that

[16:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> the bridge has been shut down before so I think better internal communication would only help

[16:06] <lizmat> agree... having a moderator only bridge to #raku-steering-council would already be a good start

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> I'm afraid we may actually be seeing more of these types of events, given the easy access to chat generating bots.

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> You think it was a bot?

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Not sure, but not impossible.

[16:09] <lizmat> https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-beginner/2023-04-20.html#13:59   all of that written within *4* seconds

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Bot, or she has text ready for pasting.

[16:14] <lizmat> yeah, but is that normal behaviour: to gather up all the things you want to say, and then blurt it out?

[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> IRC clients tend to split messages, no?

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> uhhh, I'm back but it appears like I currently don't have create channels permission on the Discord side. I'll have the mod-only raku-steering-council bridge set up as soon as Rog creates the channel (pinged him about it already)

[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I like the word blurt... It should have been named blurterBot instead of orylesor

[16:25] <lizmat> Nemokosch  they indeed to, but generally just after X characters, not at line breaks, in my experience

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> That was one of my (voiced) conjectures too. ðŸ™‚

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs> Yeah, that idea surprised me at first, but upon rereading what had been said, it made sense.

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> How can they be so hateful to Anton, what with his beautiful accent and all

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Rog> Love you videos btw, that ChatGPT one was very interesting

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> btw for others concerned: yes the steering council bridge has been made

[17:57] <lizmat> confirmed  :-)

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Zephyr> I'll go sleep for now, have a nice day/night y'all
