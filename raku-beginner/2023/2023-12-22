[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Hello, how can I use throttle() to limit the call to lets say 1 per second? I somehow can not make it work. Thank you.

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m:   my atomicint $lock = 0;   react {       whenever watch-recursive($dir).throttle(1) {             if cas($lock, 0, 1) {               $runner.run;               cas($lock, 1, 0);                             }       }   }

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Variable '$dir' is not declared.  Did you mean '&dir'? at /home/glot/main.raku:3 ------>       whenever watch-recursive(‚èè$dir).throttle(1) { 

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> It works like this but I suspect that there will be many events emited by watch-recursive() (from IO::Notification::Recursive). I also fail to get it working using the build in watch-path().

[18:51] <ab5tract> rcmlz: are you trying to have `$runner.run` call once every second? or you only want to process one event per second?
