[05:53] <jaguart> what's the best way return an array as a list or empty-list?

[05:54] <jaguart> m: sub a { my @a; return |@a }; dd a;

[05:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[05:54] <jaguart> m: sub a { my @a; return @a ?? @a.Slip !! Empty }; dd a;

[05:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: OUTPUT: «Empty␤»

[05:55] <jaguart> I want to use it for .map() calls...

[06:01] <jaguart> maybe I'm overthinking it?

[06:01] <jaguart> m: class c { method a { my @a; return @a; } }; dd c.new.a;

[06:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: OUTPUT: «Array @a = []␤»

[06:02] <jaguart> m: class c { method a { my @a; return @a; } }; for c.new.a -> { say "x" };

[06:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: ( no output )

[06:04] <jaguart> m: class c { method a { my @a; return |@a; } }; for c.new.a -> $x { say "x" };

[06:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: OUTPUT: «x␤»

[06:08] <jaguart> m: class c { method a { my @a; return @a.flat; } }; for c.new.a -> $x { say "x" };

[06:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 953fdd624: ( no output )

[08:27] <CIAvash> @a if @a?

[08:42] <jaguart> are there issues with developing and installing a module on the same server?

[08:44] <jaguart> in my Module dev area, raku -e --stagestats 'use Grok; grok( 4 )' ===> Stage parse      :   0.137

[08:45] <jaguart> outside my module dev folds:  ===> Stage parse      :  54.729

[08:45] <jaguart> * /folds/folder/

[08:46] <jaguart> is there a way to test / rebuild all the .precomps etc?

[10:32] *** Kaiepi joined
[10:59] <lizmat> jaguart: are you using -I ?

[11:00] <lizmat> if you remove ~/.raku/precomp , all modules that have their precomp files in there (generally all normally installed modules) will have to re-precompile

[11:01] <Nemokosch> you missed out on a lot because the bridge is broken in one direction

[11:02] <Nemokosch> turns out RAKULIB was set in a way that kinda sabotaged module lookup

[11:03] <Nemokosch> what would still be interesting to know is what actually took so long in that case. Aren't all scripts cached some way?

[11:22] <lizmat> I think so, ugexe or nine would know for sure

[22:36] <jaguart> lizmat: I was using RAKULIB-=lib,. so that prove6 would work and to save typing on the command line
