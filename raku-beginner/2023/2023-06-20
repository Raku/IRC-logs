[19:34] <molotov> Hi, guys! I'm looking for an answer on the next question: is there a bitfields support in the CStruct?

[19:34] <molotov> If the answer is "no", then is there a way to emulate them?

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> worst case scenario, you can use an unsigned value and bitshift, no idea if they are supported though
