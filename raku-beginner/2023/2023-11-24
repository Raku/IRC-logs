[21:51] <habere-et-disper> Hello rakoons ! :]

[21:51] <habere-et-disper> Is the link failure of 2023-11-01 known ?

[21:51] <habere-et-disper> I get a `Undefined symbols`  when compiling.

[21:58] <MasterDuke> where/how are you building? it builds fine for me

[22:32] <habere-et-disper> macOS, using the star instructions

[22:33] <habere-et-disper> `linking libmoar.dylib

[22:33] <habere-et-disper> Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

[22:33] <habere-et-disper> ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64`

[22:56] <habere-et-disper> A little earlier in the log:

[22:56] <habere-et-disper> "3rdparty/libuv/src/unix/fs.c:434:11: warning: implicit declaration of function 'preadv' is invalid in C99 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

[22:56] <habere-et-disper>       r = preadv(fd, bufs, nbufs, off);"

[22:56] <habere-et-disper> Not sure if that is relevant.
