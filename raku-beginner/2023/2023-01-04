[15:36] <CodeTortoise> Hello. Does anyone know of any resources for using Raku for linguistics? Such as analyzing a corpus? I have no doubt that a language designed for text processing by a linguists would be awesome in this domain, but basically all the language tools are done using Python.

[15:51] <lizmat> guifa and anton antonov would be the people to check with, I'd say

[15:56] <CodeTortoise> Thank you.

[15:57] <lizmat> CodeTortoise: some blog posts: https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com

[16:00] <CodeTortoise> This is cool. This is the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you!

[16:03] <lizmat> you're welcome, have fun!

[16:15] <CodeTortoise> One more, kind of dumb question: Is there something like a "clear" command for the Raku repl? I am going through a the Think Raku book on half my screen, and the other half a terminal, and I would like to be able to clear the screen between examples without exiting.

[16:17] <lizmat> other than ^C, arrow up, ENTER

[16:17] <lizmat> I don't know of any

[16:17] <lizmat> but then I'm *not* a regular REPL user

[16:18] <CodeTortoise> Ah, yeah. No worries, I need to be writing to files anyways to do the exercises, so I am just splitting the screen. 

[16:19] <CodeTortoise> Ooh. I can also tab. I really need to learn my terminal emulator better.

[16:20] <lizmat> :-)

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> I did some wrestling with MacOS Monterey (& ARM) about a year ago (https://p6steve.wordpress.com/2021/11/18/raku-at-the-monterey-docks/)

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> My conclusion is that Apple is slowly and steadily dropping proper support for Unix dev on the Mac

[19:41] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> My advice in a nutshell is to use Docker + Ubuntu to sidesteps these issues - if you want ease of use & compatibility (ARM and x86 images) then use the MacOS Docker Desktop (the "external" Jupyter world such as prpe-build Jupyter Docker images and binder is x86 heavy).

[19:45] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> If you want fast (for load and for execution), then use vftools (I reference an excellent installation guide in the blog post part 2). I find a combination of both is most sensible. My typical workday is start ubuntu VM on vftools (~3s), ssh in, run ubuntu on Docker on this ubuntu xN. I have a collection of Docker stacks here if you would like ... https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Dockerfiles including Jupyt

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> This implies that you work in vi / cli -- or it may be that the IntelliJ ssh to docker server is now working with the Comma plugin (haven't tested recently). And that you do not have a whole bunch of Mac UI stuff / other languages that you want to switch between ;-(

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ymmv

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@928301352029937715> Nice summary, advice. Maybe you should make a blog post and/or post it on reddit.
