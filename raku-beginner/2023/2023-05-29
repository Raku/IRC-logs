[11:47] <lizmat> librasteve looks like you made https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/13uqa28/httpsrakujourneywordpresscom20230529allomorphia/ incorrect ?

[13:23] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2023/05/29/2023-22-rakuast-rolling/

[13:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Can I use raku instead of awk in this shell command ? :  ps -aux | grep -i jupyter | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -Iaaa kill -9 aaa

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Actually, a raku one-liner for the "whole thing" would be nice took.

[13:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> (I don't think "App::Rak" can be used for that...)

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> What does it do?

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Finds all processes of the current user that have "jupyter" in their associated file names and kills them.

[13:30] <lizmat> rak '{ run "kill", .words.head }

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> can pkill not just do this btw

[13:30] <lizmat> '

[13:31] <lizmat> Anton Antonov ^^

[13:31] <lizmat> rak '{ run "kill", .words[0] }'

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Great! Trying it out now.

[13:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat I am getting the error message: "Can't locate PAR.pm in @INC (you may need to install the PAR module) [...]"

[13:37] <lizmat> que?

[13:38] <lizmat> could you gist a full --ll-exception  stacktrace somewhere ?

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Sorry, I just had to do rehash  -- it is working now.

[13:39] <lizmat> *phew*  :-)

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yep

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> raku -e "shell <pkill -9 -f 'jupyter'>"

[16:38] <lizmat> but then why the raku ?

[16:38] <lizmat> pkill -9 -f 'jupyter'    would have worked, no ?

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^++ true that ... it's nice that rak can do it, but I suppose that the pure pkill is the most sensible

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok, I have never used pkill before.
