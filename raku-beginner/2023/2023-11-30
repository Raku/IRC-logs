[23:47] <DarthGandalf> Hi, me again :) I have some problems using perl5 code from raku: first, if any .pm file is in a deep subdirectory of current dir, it shows a warning for me ".pm file extension in raku library path seen at:" even if I don't try to load that code at all. I basically did "cpanm -L . Foo::Bar" to avoid polluting my system dirs

[23:48] <DarthGandalf> Another problem is that Inline::Perl5 doesn't let me subclass from perl5 package

[23:49] <DarthGandalf> https://bpa.st/QQRA - when I try to call findPath(), it tells: Can't locate object method "doAStar" via package "Day11::MyStar" at ../libp5/lib/perl5/AI/Pathfinding/AStar.pm line 102.

[23:49] <DarthGandalf> doAStar is what internally findPath calls (in perl 5)

[23:50] <DarthGandalf> I also tried another perl5 library, as seen in the code - Graph::Implicit, but that one had another issue: it tries to bless a Sub passed to it into its package

[23:51] <DarthGandalf> then later it cannot find the astar() method I'm calling on the Sub object
