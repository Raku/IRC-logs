[00:14] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> The only downside is using X doesn't maintain the structure, ie. The first snippet you posted would produce a 9-element list of 9-element lists, whereas the second will produce a single 81-element list

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> You could maintain structure with something like  (1..9).map(* X 1..9) 

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> depends what you need

[00:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean... what other purpose would "doing it in one for loop" serve

[00:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you don't want to get the number of outcomes the nesting would produce, i.e the product

[01:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> I was just iterating over a 2d grid and wanted to avoid a nesting level

[15:39] <Guest10> Hey anyone here

[15:40] <rf> o/

[15:40] <Guest10> Wow

[15:40] <rf> Wow?

[15:40] <Guest10> Didn't expected anybody tbh

[15:41] <Guest10> First time using libera chat

[15:41] <rf> This channel is fairly active, same with #raku

[15:41] <Guest10> So don't know much about here

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what's up

[15:43] <Guest10> Just saw a video of an old guy white hairs praising Raku so I got curious n am going to learn it

[15:43] <lizmat> does that old guy have a name ?   which video?

[15:43] <lizmat> just OOC

[15:44] <Guest10> Curtis poe

[15:44] <Guest10> https://youtu.be/LEFVQaSgJ60

[15:45] <Guest10> What

[15:45] <Guest10> Just happened

[15:45] <lizmat> I don't know? what happened?

[15:46] <rf> Hmm, I watched that video too last year when I started learning Raku :^)

[15:46] <Guest10> #you have been marked as being away

[15:46] <rf> That + Moritz book

[15:46] <Guest10> Book ðŸ™‚ which book

[15:46] * lizmat is still here

[15:47] <rf> https://www.amazon.com/Raku-Fundamentals-Examples-Projects-Studies/dp/1484261089

[15:47] <Guest10> rf so after one year of experience

[15:47] <Guest10> How is it so far ?

[15:47] <Guest10> You njoying

[15:48] <rf> No, I read that when I started

[15:48] <rf> But I have quite a bit of programming experience already

[15:48] <rf> It was good, I like his writing style and examples

[15:49] <Guest10> Any suggestions for this neophyte on where should I start

[15:49] <rf> Are you brand new to programming?

[15:49] <Guest10> Yup

[15:50] <Guest10> Blank like a black board

[15:50] <Guest10> Or white board

[15:50] <rf> Awesome, do you have Raku installed?

[15:50] <Guest10> Nope

[15:50] <lizmat> Guest10: then maybe https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/ is something for you

[15:50] <lizmat> "This aim of this book is not primarily to teach Raku, but instead to teach the art of programming, using the Raku language."

[15:51] <rf> Was just about to link that, lizmat++ :)

[15:51] <Guest10> ðŸ˜¸ *lucky

[15:52] <rf> Oh, there's a free PDF too, neat!

[16:20] <Sussysham> ok all set

[16:33] <Sussysham> thanks for book guys

[16:33] <Sussysham> i will jump right into it

[16:33] <rf> Take your time, programming is all about practice :)

[16:34] <Sussysham> and get back to you if i got stuck somewhere

[16:34] <rf> Yeah, that's what this channel is for !

[16:35] <Sussysham> i will be in your care

[16:36] <Sussysham> see ya later

[16:36] <rf> You're in the Raku communities care, not mine

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> hey guys, I'm trying to get a decent calculus module installed and I'm still not quite completely competent with the way these things interact/using linux in general

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> anyway I got zef installed and running

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I'm thinking of trying this:  https://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/physical-modelling.html

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> it says to use Proto to install it?

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> or does Raku have native ODE/PDE support?

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> I found that while searching

[18:35] <gfldex> `zef install Math::Model` works just fine

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> seems to have installed, thanks

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> gonna play around and see if it's working xD

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Proto -> Ufo -> Panda -> Zef iirc

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That must be ancient...

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> if it calculuses then ðŸ¤·

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ðŸ˜‚

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph> it works!

[22:21] *** jgaz left
[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Is there a raku equivalent of python * or javascript ...? Like a way to do funcOf2Vars(@listof2items), and split the list into 2 args of the function

[23:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> |

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nHail> Thanks

[23:25] <rf> slip @args or |@args, slips rock

[23:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it can be tricky. If you want to flatten into a capture, @args.Slip won't work, for example

[23:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm only using | for that - that's the sigil of capture parameters anyway

[23:29] <rf> What about *@args as a parameter

[23:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's kind of the opposite thing, right?

[23:31] <rf> Maybe? I'm not super familiar with Captures besides the fact they're the opposite of Signatures

[23:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one thing is sure, *@args is not a full capture, it's rather a placeholder inside a capture
