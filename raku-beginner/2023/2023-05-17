[14:22] <pusha> does Raku have object literals a la Javascript?

[14:22] <pusha> like

[14:22] <pusha> const x= {a: 7}

[14:23] <gfldex> m: constant x = class { has $.a is rw = 7 }; my %h = :a(7); dd x, %h;

[14:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 50fc47cf6: OUTPUT: «<anon|1>␤Hash %h = {:a(7)}␤»

[14:23] <gfldex> pusha: not really, but ^^^

[14:24] <pusha> ok thanks

[14:27] *** tea3po left
[14:27] <lizmat> my constant x = { a => 7 }  ??

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the question is, which one is the important part: "object" or "literal"

[14:31] <gfldex> So, how constant do you want your constant to be? :->

[14:32] <lizmat> my constant x = { a => 7 }.Map

[14:32] <lizmat> my constant x = { a => 7 }.Map; x<a> = 42   # Cannot change key 'a' in an immutable Map

[14:38] <pusha> the constant part is not important

[14:41] <gfldex> pusha: Then you should use a Hash.

[14:46] <lizmat> is this maybe about aliasing a value in a hash to a variable?

[14:46] <lizmat> m: my %h; my $a := %h<a>; dd %h; $a = 42; dd %h

[14:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 50fc47cf6: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {}␤Hash %h = {:a(42)}␤»

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Hashes are mutable mappings from keys to values, known in other programming languages as dicts (Python), objects (Javascript) or Hash Maps (Java).

[21:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^^ https://docs.raku.org/type/Hash

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so the equivalent to a JS object is a raku Hah

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: my %h = :a(7); say %h<a>

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  7
