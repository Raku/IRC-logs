[14:40] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> i have a question: assuming I have a proto method, and i want to dispatch on a particular parameter, and the possible types for that particular parameter are either %signals (an Associative) and Str $signals, what would that parameter in the signature look like, would it beMu $signals?

[15:14] <disbot6> <nahita3882> $signals where Associative | Str?
