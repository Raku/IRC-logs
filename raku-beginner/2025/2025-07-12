[21:29] <Guest77> hi all! im looking to collaborate with code/docs

[21:34] <disbot3> <librasteve> please do ... all help gratefully received

[21:34] <disbot3> <librasteve> what interests you about raku?

[21:36] <disbot3> <librasteve> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22

[21:38] <Guest77> I'm an Elixir developer, I had to parse HUGE lists of Chat logs concurrently... I ended up finding Raku and it solved my problem quickly haha

[21:39] <Guest77> I've been using it for about 4 months now

[21:39] <disbot3> <librasteve> cool - be careful its quite addictive

[21:40] <disbot3> <librasteve> thats a sweet spot for raku (lazy file read + regex)

[21:43] *** habere-et-disper joined
[21:44] <disbot3> <librasteve> there's plenty of stuff to help with ... I would defer to some of the core devs if you want to get stuck into core code ... we are pushing to upgrade the docs site to rakudoc v2 so that would be a less steep curve and equally helpful

[21:58] <Guest77> It looks really good to me.Â  I'm already reading and seeing where to work on the open issues in the docs. I'd also love to contribute code and any "front end" features too

[22:01] *** habere-et-disper left
[22:03] <disbot3> <librasteve> cool - I must sleep, but take a look at the Air module docs (see raku.land) if you get a chance as the idea is to make a new front end... lets chat again tomorrow
