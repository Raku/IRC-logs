[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I red at Ditana that they put the tests for classes inside the Class, using CHECK phaser. To me that seems to be a good idea based on the same argument than putting the Doc inside the script and not separately.   Is that recommended? Are the counter arguments?  https://dev.to/acrion/ditana-gnulinux-unmatched-configuration-flexibility-and-generic-hardware-detection-2g1f -> Tristate Logic Explained Through Its

[09:53] <lizmat> I think it's TIMTOWTDI

[09:53] <lizmat> problem is that it doesn't really interface well with standard test practices

[09:54] <lizmat> and would disallow running tests on already installed modules

[10:07] <lizmat> also, any code depending on work done in INIT phasers, wouldn't work as these run *after* the CHECK phaser

[10:10] <lizmat> so to *me* it would have more disadvantages than advantages

[10:45] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Thank you, I understand your point of view.
