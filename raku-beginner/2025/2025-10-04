[00:58] <disbot3> <antononcube> Raku is the best language for LLMs!!!

[00:59] <disbot3> <antononcube> After programming in Raku for few years, I can’t stand looking at Perl.

[13:52] <disbot3> <antononcube> @neekotism Can you install "Digest::SHA" with the following command?  zef install Digest::SHA 

[13:54] <ds7832> Can someone point me to documentation that explains how "my Int $x" and "my int $x" differ? I came to this from how they're used in this code example to distinguish multimethods https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Inheritance_and_multis

[13:54] <ds7832> m: my @l = (my Int $x, my int $y, my Int $z = 1, my int $w = 2); say @l

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: OUTPUT: «[(Int) 0 1 2]␤»

[13:56] <ds7832> Is it that lower-case `int` initializes them to their default value (0 in this case, "" for strings, etc)?

[14:01] <ds7832> The typegraph on Int (https://docs.raku.org/type/Int) shows int is a subclass, but the link to it is 404: https://docs.raku.org/type/int

[14:06] <ds7832> m: Int.HOW

[14:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: ( no output )

[14:07] <ds7832> m: int.HOW

[14:07] <disbot3> <neekotism> I can't

[14:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: ( no output )

[14:08] <ds7832> m: say Int.HOW

[14:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: OUTPUT: «Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW.new␤»

[14:08] <ds7832> m: say int.HOW

[14:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: OUTPUT: «Perl6::Metamodel::NativeHOW.new␤»

[14:51] <disbot3> <antononcube> @neekotism Try to install from GitHub and/or by downloading the package. That package does not seem to exist in raku.land. You might have an odd combination of OS/packages/versions.

[15:00] <ds7832> @neekotism: Did you perhaps mean Digest::SHA1 , with a 1 at the end? I think I had to insatll that one a couple of days ago.

[15:10] <ds7832> oh sorry, nevermind that. I got confused reading through the messages.

[15:34] <arkiuat> ds7832, have you looked at https://docs.raku.org/language/nativetypes yet? That is where lower-case int is documented and its differences from Int discussed

[15:35] <arkiuat> also https://docs.raku.org/language/numerics#Native_numerics

[15:54] <ds7832> arkiuat: That answers it, thanks!

[15:58] <arkiuat> cool
