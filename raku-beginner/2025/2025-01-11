[00:01] <msiism> `push(@nums, prompt("Please enter number {$n + 1}: "));` also works fine.

[00:47] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> @arr[$i + 1] = $val will also work, it will autovivify wherever you want; the missed spots, if any, are filled with the default value of the container ((Int) in this case)

[17:17] <msiism> I'm still having problems with adding elements to arrays using `@arr[$i + 1] = â€¦`: https://termbin.com/xj6p

[17:19] <msiism> Doing it this way seems to add a potentially arbitrary number of empty arguments of type (Any) before the element I want to add.

[17:21] <msiism> I just got I've seen `[Red (Any) (Any) (Any) Blue]`, for example, after using the above method to add "Blue" to an array that already contained "Red".

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> when you do @arr[$idx] = ..., there are 2 cases to consider: i) $idx is "in bounds", i.e., $idx < @arr.elems; in this case usual assignment to already-existing element

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> ii) $idx is "out of bounds", i.e., $idx >= @arr.elems; in this case, Raku will assign the value to $idxth index while making the array length $idx + 1. The in-between $idx - @arr.elems elements are filled with the default values

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> for example: @arr is ["y", "e", "s"], then i do @arr[3] = "a", then @arr becomes ["y", "e", "s", "a"]

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there was no hole left behind, and it's as if we .pushed, no Any appearing ($idx is 3 and so is @arr.elems prior to assignment)

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> another example: @arr is ["y", "e", "s"], then i do @arr[4] = "a", then @arr becomes ["y", "e", "s", (Any), "a"]

[17:28] <msiism> Okay, $i was one off in my case.

[17:28] <msiism> I had set its initial value to 1 instead of 0.

[17:31] <msiism> Thanks for the explanation!
