[11:26] <ds7832> m: my @months = 1..12; say @months[9, *-3]

[11:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: OUTPUT: «(10 10)␤»

[11:27] <ds7832> So list slices where the right argument is counting from the back and in this way coincides with the left argument actually contain the same list element twice.

[11:28] <ds7832> Is there a simple way to get just (10) in this case?

[11:30] <ds7832> Like e.g. in python: x = [i for i in range(1,13)]; x[9:-2]

[11:31] <ds7832> which gives [10]

[11:36] <ds7832> nevermind, I misunderstood the slice syntax

[11:37] <ds7832> m: my @months = 1..12; say @months[9..*-3]

[11:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5147b67f7: OUTPUT: «(10)␤»

[11:37] <ds7832> So everything as expected. ^^
