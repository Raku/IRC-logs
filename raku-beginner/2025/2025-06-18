[17:05] <habere-et-disper> I was expecting a tuple when key greping a shaped array... 

[17:05] <habere-et-disper> m: my @foo[2;2] = [['R','A'],['K','U']]; say @foo.grep( 'U', :k ); # Expecting tuple (1,1)

[17:31] <timo> sounds like we don't have an implementation of grep specifically for shaped arrays, so it just goes via .list.grep?

[17:32] <timo> m: my @foo[2;2] = [["R","A"],["K","U"]]; say @foo.pairs.grep( *.value eq "U" );

[17:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 92068d9b4: OUTPUT: «((1 1) => U)␤»

[17:32] <timo> can always go via .pairs.grep or .kv.grep

[17:33] <timo> but this probably wants at least a ticket, if you're comfortable submitting issues on github?
