[17:10] <timo> apart from glot.io there is tio.run that has raku (though it is currently still named Perl 6), and i think repl.it has rakudo too, but it doesn't seem to be "free to instantly use" any more like it was last time i looked?

[17:11] <timo> and replit is pushing "build all your stuff using AI" now, which i'm personally not a fan of

[17:18] <timo> > moar (2018.12)
