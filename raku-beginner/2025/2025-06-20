[11:13] <disbot2> <ng0177> So I did:  zef install WWW::LLaMA and downloaded Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q4_0.llamafile Two question: I need to always start up mistral server on CLI before running the notebook? A second question is how to make use of the GPU (Nvidia) which happens on the command line by -ngl 999 Thanks

[11:49] <disbot2> <antononcube> 1) Yes. 2) I am not sure — I think I have seen that “kick in” when making / using embeddings.

[15:31] <disbot2> <librasteve> (how) can I apply a predeclared sig in a sub...

[15:31] <disbot2> <librasteve> m: my $sig = :(Int $x); sub fn($sig) {say $x}; fn 42;

[15:31] <disbot2> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Variable '$x' is not declared.  Perhaps you forgot a 'sub' if this was intended to be part of a signature? at /home/glot/main.raku:1 ------> my $sig = :(Int $x); sub fn($sig) {say ⏏$x}; fn 42; 

[15:32] <disbot2> <librasteve> m: my $sig = :(Int $x); sub fn(|$sig) {say $x}; fn 42;

[15:32] <timo> you can't do that without some kind of construct that does compilation

[15:33] <disbot2> <librasteve> timo: tx ... guess the error led me to think that there is a non-obsolete use ;-)

[15:44] <ab5tract> This could be considered an LTA, I think

[16:01] *** habere-et-disper joined
[16:02] <timo> well, there's not really a syntax you could even write in your `sub bla(*here*)` that would not be a variable *declaration*, which are on purpose not able to be influenced by the values of outer variables with the same name

[16:26] <ab5tract> My thought was that we should have enough knowledge to know what the user is trying to do, so we could provide more specific feedback here
