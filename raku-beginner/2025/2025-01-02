[01:30] *** sjn joined
[01:36] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> is there a way to get the digits of an integer?

[01:41] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> is that equiv to |((1,2) xx 3) or is (|(1,2)) xx 3 a special thing

[02:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Try 335.Str.comb

[02:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The latter I would say, sematically speaking.

[03:34] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> ahh ok cool

[03:35] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF>  123.Str.comb>>.^name   why's this yield Seq and not Str

[05:31] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> Also, how can I make $!value.comb.map({ ::?CLASS.new: .Int }).list cleaner without using .map?

[05:31] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> I feel like there's an easier way

[05:48] <discord-raku-bot> <uli.pink> hai, i am confused about @ vs $ with arrays. i can seemingly assign arrays and clone arrays to identifiers with $ and also index into them, however the converse is not true, however i cannot store non-array types into an @ identifier, i tried introspecting with WHAT but im still confused

[05:57] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> frmo what i understand, you can program all of raku just using $—the @ sigil is a holdover from perl. but i could be totall yoff-base about it

[08:49] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> The % and @ sigils in Raku generally indicate multiple values to an iteration construct, whereas the $ sigil indicates only one value.

[09:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think both Steve Roe and Elizabeth Mattijsen have articles on Raku sigils .

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> that's a bug, some compile time transformation happens for the metamethod and it doesn't play well with the hyper

[14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> same happens for .WHAT, too

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i had asked about the case of WHAT, and it's to do with it being a macro-like thing

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I thought it was a feature, which I could not explain (to myself and others...)

[20:12] <SrainUser> I'm getting the error: 'use lib' cannot be pre-compiled and thus cannot be used in a module. What do I use instead of 'use lib "."' in imported modules?

[20:38] *** Heptite joined
[21:11] <SrainUser> My question was answered on the main raku channel.
