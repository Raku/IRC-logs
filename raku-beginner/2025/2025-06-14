[21:53] <thowe> so there is a first method to find the first element of a list matching a pattern, but there is no "last" to find the last element matching a pattern.  Bummer.

[22:24] <lizmat> first( :end)

[22:25] <lizmat> m: say <foo bar baz>.first(*.starts-with("ba"), :end)

[22:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar e591b023d: OUTPUT: «baz␤»

[22:25] <lizmat> thowe ^^

[22:26] <lizmat> unfortunately "end" and "last" already had different semantics as method names

[22:43] <thowe> I think I can just reverse the array, splice on front, and when I am done reverse it again.

[23:17] <thowe> I seem to recall there is a way to name a loop, so that when you are in the loop, even if inside another loop, you can go to the "next" item in the loop further up the loop hierachy.  I am getting stuck in a while loop; I need to tell it to go to the next item in the conatingin for loop.

[23:18] <thowe> ah, labels I think

[23:19] <thowe> bingo.
