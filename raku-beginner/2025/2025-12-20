[15:34] <deoac> what enviroment variable do i need to set so that my modules can find /opt/homebrew/lib/libmagic.dylib

[15:39] <arkiuat> RAKULIB or RAKUDOLIB might be what you want

[15:40] <arkiuat> https://docs.raku.org/programs/03-environment-variables#Affecting_execution_from_the_command_line

[15:40] <deoac> ~/Documents/Development/🦋% echo $RAKUDOLIB

[15:40] <deoac> ~/Documents/Development/🦋% echo $RAKULIB

[15:41] *** sibl left
[15:41] <deoac> '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rakudo/2025.11/share/perl6/site/sources,.:./lib,/opt/homebrew/lib'

[15:41] <deoac> that's the response to both of the `echo` commands

[15:41] <deoac> libmagic is still not found.

[15:43] <deoac> `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rakudo/2025.11/share/perl6/site/sources,.:./lib,/opt/homebrew/lib`

[15:43] <arkiuat> oh right, libmagic.dylib is not a Raku module. This is on a Mac, right?

[15:43] <deoac> yes, Sequoia 15

[15:47] <arkiuat> I used to know some stuff about this that I've forgotten. Right now I'm looking at https://github.com/Raku/App-Rakubrew/issues/9

[15:48] <arkiuat> that might not be the best reference on this, but it might have some clues for you

[15:50] <arkiuat> okay, this might be what you want to look at: https://docs.raku.org/language/nativecall#MacOS_-_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH_is_ignored

[15:50] <arkiuat> that has two links to further info in it

[15:53] <deoac> thanks for your help, I'll check them out

[16:03] <deoac> I ended up making a symbolic link in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rakudo-star/2025.11/lib`.  That worked.  Bummer that I have to do this every time I update rakudo...

[16:46] <SmokeMachine> deoac: maybe this can help: https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/MacOS::NativeLib

[16:52] *** human-blip left
[16:53] <deoac> I test it out, thanks.  And thanks Liz!
