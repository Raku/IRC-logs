[04:20] <disbot1> <myrlynx> It doesn't work. I thought it would be backwards compatible

[08:30] <disbot1> <rcmlz> I guess we should consider adding nix and guix to the installation recommendations - especially for „difficult packages“ with a lot of dependencies that might lower the barrier for people (not beginners but rather professionals) to give Raku a shot.

[08:32] <disbot1> <rcmlz> The Python-People have it like that, that you can specify the packages you want directly, in Raku someone can easily install only rakudo+zef and the iterate a list of packages to ve installed via zef.

[08:35] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Instead of rakubrew you specify the Raku version you want directly in the nix/guix „configuration file“

[08:49] <disbot1> <librasteve> zef install cro --/test is the best way to install Cro - note the way that test is excluded (this is what is [or at least should be] stated onthe various Cro getting started advice) ... why? the cro tests perform loopback tests via eg localhost so can fail based on your network permissions or your .hosts file

[08:50] <disbot1> <librasteve> if you MUST do the tests, then git clone cro and raku them indivudually

[09:30] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I'll try it out thanks

[10:07] <disbot1> <myrlynx> You're amazing thank you it worked out. I wish it had shown the option for skipping tests on zef. I couldn't find info on it

[14:25] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Probably not a good use case but I just got an iPad, I installed iSH and install Raku by changing to Alpine edge repo The installation succeed but raku segfault as soon as it’s started  I don’t know if anyone tried before or could guess why it happens ? I don’t get details, I tried strace but it doesn’t work with iSH

[20:01] <arkiuat> librasteve all I can say about the MacPorts packaging of rakudo is "works for me." I've been using it and keeping it "updated" (they are currently at 2025.05 still, I just checked it) for a couple of years now.
