[15:13] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Is this good or there is a short better way more idiomatic to create a hash from array “array.map({key, value}).flat”  ?

[15:13] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> For example if the array contains text and the value should be the checksum of it

[15:13] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> To have a hash word -> hash

[15:18] <disbot1> <librasteve> `%(@a.map: { $ => cs($) })

[15:19] <disbot1> <librasteve> or my Hash() %h = @a.map: { $_ => cs($_) }

[15:19] <disbot1> <librasteve> is that what you haev in mind?

[15:22] <lizmat> my %h = array.kv ?

[15:26] <disbot1> <librasteve> oh - sorry no need for the Hash() type coercion in my second example

[15:29] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Ah the arrow alright, indeed looks better, thanks !

[15:30] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> The hash isn’t in the base array, that is to be computed in the map or a for loop 🙏

[15:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> yeah, similar idea to , is the operator that makes a List my @a = 1,2,3; the fat arrow => makes a Pair (then we need the assignment with %hash on the LHS to stick our List of Pairs into a Hash)

[15:48] <disbot1> <librasteve> hopefully you get the idea that cs() is shorthand for your checksum maker sub
