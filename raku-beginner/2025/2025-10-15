[16:40] <disbot9> <rcmlz> Out of curiosity I wanted to give https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IPC_via_named_pipe#Raku a whirl.  The current implementation mimics the Perl solution and I was wondering if there is a more Rakoon-Way-Of-Doing-It, using the build in Supply and watch-path Method and no NativeCall and no external libraries like https://raku.land/zef:jonathanstowe/MQ::Posix I guess.  I took some initial notes https://glot.io/snippets/hc27bmi5ys

[16:40] <disbot9>    Is that feasible? Is file creation, watch-path, supply, tap and things like that sufficient or is NativeCall needed here?  Thank you for some hints.

[18:00] <lizmat> watch-path works fine: it powers the irclogs live function  :-)
