[05:19] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @msiism I thought the biggest advantage of using a hash is (near) constant-time lookup?

[05:22] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my @h = ('a', 'b' ... Inf)[^99000] Z=> (^99000); say @h[91394];

[05:22] <disbot4> <Raku eval>  eeee => 91394 

[05:26] *** arkiuat left
[05:28] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my @h = ('a', 'b' ... Inf)[^99000] Z=> (^99000); say @h.grep({ .key eq "eeee" });

[05:28] <disbot4> <Raku eval>  (eeee => 91394) 

[05:38] *** arkiuat joined
[05:43] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my @h = ('a', 'b' ... Inf)[^99000] Z=> (^99000); .value.put if .key eq "eeee" for @h;

[05:43] <disbot4> <Raku eval>  91394

[05:46] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> Similarly, can do  put @h.grep({ .key eq "eeee"}, :k) to get 91394, the key-index position in @h.

[11:55] <disbot4> <librasteve> good point … i was mainly illustrating/checking my assertion that (string) Hash is fast … seems to go slower on my machine somewhere between 100,000 items and 1,000,000 items which i suspect is falling off the end of RAM
