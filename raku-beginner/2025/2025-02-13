[22:11] <habere-et-disper> I'm struggling to get raku installed on nixos.

[22:11] <habere-et-disper> There appears to be no rakudo-star there.

[22:11] <habere-et-disper> So went with plain raku but that can't see Readline although that's installed too.

[22:11] <habere-et-disper> Do I have to fiddle with the environment LD_* ?

[22:11] <habere-et-disper> Thanks !

[23:30] <habere-et-disper> In `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`

[23:30] <habere-et-disper> I have `environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ readline70 rakudo ];`

[23:30] <habere-et-disper> What else do I need to do to get raku to find readline ?

[23:33] <habere-et-disper> `zef install Readline` fails with `Cannot locate native library 'libreadline.so.7': libreadline.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

[23:39] <lizmat_> instal libreadline first?

[23:43] <habere-et-disper> I think it is installed via adding it to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`. It's just not seeing it as I see `libreadline.so` down in `/nix/store/...` among other places.

[23:52] <habere-et-disper> So it works if I do `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/nix/store/XXX/lib/` andthen `zef install Readline` where XXX is a long and hardcoded folder -- which doesn't seem right.

[23:54] <habere-et-disper> I found the folder doing a recursive search for `libreadline.so`
