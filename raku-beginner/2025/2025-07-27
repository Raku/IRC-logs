[20:08] <msiism> I used `zef install UUID` to install the UUID::V4 module. But when I run the Raku REPL and say `use UUID::V4`, it cannot be found. What can I do about that?

[20:28] <msiism> Here's the error message I get: https://www.msiism.org/pb/G5pkMD/r

[20:34] <disbot4> <sp2> I picked up Raku yesterday, but from what I gathered you need to write full module path you want to install, so zef install UUID::V4

[21:24] <msiism> Okay, that solved the problem. Thanks.
