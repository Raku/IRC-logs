[07:35] <sibl> is there a "prefered" way to `use` a local module in a project, so that wherever I start the script, the script can still find the module to import (which should always be in the same path with the script) ?

[07:37] <sibl> so basically another way than doing `use lib $*EXECUTABLE.dirname`

[07:38] <sibl> $*PROGRAM-NAME (my bad)

[07:39] <sibl> $*PROGRAM (jesus christ xD) other than `use lib $*PROGRAM.dirname`

[08:07] <disbot6> <nhail> Is there a way to declare left or right associativity of an infix operator?

[08:20] <disbot6> <librasteve> sibl: I would say the “preferred” way is to use raku -I. my script.raku, or if you have a hashbang and make you script executable, then place a use lib ‘.’;  just below.

[08:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> sibl: another way is to make your script a mini module (eg with App::Mi6), set up the dependency in META6.json and go zef install . —force-install each time … slower but it does all the build steps.

[08:27] <disbot6> <librasteve> nHail: is assoc trait does this https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Associativity

[09:32] <lizmat> sibl: a lot of test files in roast use something like "use lib $*PROGRAM.sibling("lib")"   where the "lib" dir is in the same directory as the script

[09:40] <lizmat> and any modules live in that "lib" dir

[11:53] <ab5tract> neekotism: GTK::Simple is my mainstay for GUI stuff. It's relatively trivial to add anything that's missing, too

[11:53] <ab5tract> ie, part of the "simple" name comes from how simple it is to add or augment a widget

[11:54] <disbot6> <neekotism> Interesting. I'll use that then. Thank you for telling.

[13:48] <disbot6> <antononcube> @nhail This should work:  sub infix:<op>(\a, \b) is assoc<right> { ... }

[17:14] <arkiuat> sibl, I've sometimes used "use lib $?FILE.IO.parent(2).absolute" for something similar to that

[17:14] <arkiuat> that would be for scripts living in a bin directory parallel to a lib directory

[17:15] <arkiuat> I did not know about the .sibling method though! that's interesting
