[08:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> Because of superstition — the idea is that using that symbol would make raku.land’s infrastructure safe from lightning strikes and electric surges, sags, and brownouts.

[09:13] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> I like that 😆

[13:56] <disbot1> <antononcube> The kanji symbols for “earth, ground, soil, Turkey” (土) and “gentleman, samurai” (士) are very similar.
