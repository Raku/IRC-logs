[05:09] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @neekotism What are your interests? I made the mistake when starting to learn Raku of thinking that Raku is a simplified/streamlined Perl. It isn't--it is a very deep language.

[05:56] <disbot6> <neekotism> I don't think Raku is a simplified Perl at all. It's very clear that it isn't. I was looking to know about some useful things that I might not know about.

[06:50] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Agreed, bt what are you interested in? We can provide some URLs if you'd like.

[06:51] <disbot6> <neekotism> I'm not looking for a particular one but I could do with some useful links for managing systems.

[13:47] <disbot6> <jany9781> Hello all! I'm doing the Advent of Code in Raku as a way to learn the language, and I have a question about chaining things over multiple lines, which I haven't found an explanation about in the docs. I tried 2 ways: one method call per line, and using the feed operator. Each has an issue that I would like to hear your opinion about. Thanks in advance!  I made a "glot.io" snippet (it's a very mild spoiler for Day 9 of

[13:47] <disbot6> the AOC, where I'm at) https://glot.io/snippets/hdv4w6lvpd

[13:57] <disbot6> <antononcube> See these two posts: - https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/11/16/monad-laws-in-raku/ - https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/09/monadic-programming-examples/

[13:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> The latter is actually (still) showing at https://raku-advent.blog .

[14:18] <disbot6> <jany9781> Thanks! The syntax ==> { ... }() is what I was looking for, and I hadn't seen andthen yet, it works for me too.  I'm still not sure about why [] stops working when the method calls are on multiple lines though? Is it just a quirk of the syntax?

[14:26] <disbot6> <antononcube> I am not sure what you are referring to. And, yes, ==> has syntactical quirks.

[14:56] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm... I see. Well, the multi-line versions should work with andthen and ==>.

[18:33] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @neekotism DevOps? I write a lot of one-liners in Raku, but mostly for text-processing (Unicode!) not file-manipulation. Still some of these might be useful: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/112023/how-can-i-replace-a-string-in-a-files/789807#789807

[18:37] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @Jany andthen is one of my all-time-favorite constructs in Raku. Creates a local $_ topic variable that you can play with on the RHS. Still have to figure out a reasonable use case for notandthen, however.

[19:12] <habere-et-disper> Does anyone have a workaround for fez login curl error:

[19:12] <habere-et-disper> in method post at (Fez::Util::Curl) line 34

[19:13] <lizmat> perhaps gist the whole error ?

[19:24] <habere-et-disper> Is it correct that a version number for a raku l10n module appears only in META6.json and nowhere else?

[19:32] <lizmat> you mean, it should also exist in the generated modules ?

[19:32] <habere-et-disper> I am wondering that, yes?

[19:33] <lizmat> perhaps it should  :-)

[19:39] <lizmat> please make an L10N issue for it

[19:39] <lizmat> so it doesn't fall through the cracks

[22:29] <habere-et-disper> How do you include an image in rakudoc?

[22:43] <habere-et-disper> It seems =place was removed

[23:33] <lizmat> it is?

[23:35] <habere-et-disper> Seems =begin html includes the html as a code block while =begin Html can be used to include an image. Weird case-sensitivity here -- or maybe just my setup.

[23:36] <lizmat> are you running with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 ?

[23:37] <habere-et-disper> no

[23:44] <lizmat> is this about just rendering rakudoc ?

[23:44] <lizmat> if so, then you may want to try running with RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1

[23:44] <lizmat> because that has all the new RakuDoc goodies in it
