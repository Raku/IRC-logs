[19:15] <lucs_> <https://docs.raku.org/type/X/AdHoc> mentions "X::AdHoc is the type into which objects are wrapped if they are thrown as exceptions, but don't inherit from Exception.".

[19:15] <lucs_> Not sure what that means.

[19:15] <lucs_> Apart from die(), how do you throw as exceptions objects that don't inherit from Exception?

[19:15] *** lucs_ is now known as lucs

[20:28] <disbot5> <librasteve>  my $obj = Some::Thing.new; X::AdHoc.new( payload => $obj ).throw; 

[20:32] <disbot5> <nahita3882> apart from &die, one can &fail

[20:33] <disbot5> <nahita3882> m: try fail 29; $!.payload.put

[20:33] <disbot5> <Raku eval>  29 

[20:33] <disbot5> <librasteve> .oO

[20:34] <disbot5> <nahita3882> m:try fail 29; $!.WHAT.say'

[20:35] <disbot5> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Two terms in a row at /home/glot/main.raku:1 ------> try fail 29; $!.WHAT.say⏏'     expecting any of:         infix         infix stopper         statement end         statement modifier         statement modifier loop 

[20:35] <disbot5> <nahita3882> m: try fail 29; $!.WHAT.say

[20:35] <disbot5> <Raku eval>  (AdHoc) 

[22:00] <lucs> So &die and &fail do that, okay (although fail wraps but doesn't throw).

[22:02] <disbot5> <librasteve> lucs: what is the purpose of your question? do you have a code problem to solve?

[22:21] <lucs> librasteve: I'm mucking around with Exception handling in my code (going relatively well), and was just reading the docs, and that part was unclear to me.

[22:36] <disbot5> <nahita3882> i think only &die & &fail do that

[22:37] <disbot5> <nahita3882> based on searching for AdHoc in Rakudo's code

[22:38] <disbot5> <nahita3882> documentation may be a little less mysterious by saying, e.g., "i.e., &fail and &die" or something

[22:38] <disbot5> <nahita3882> if that's the case

[23:11] <lucs> Nahita: aha, thanks for the search.

[23:11] <lucs> Yeah, maybe the doc just needs a bit of tweaking (not quite sure how to put it though).
