[13:10] <disbot6> <neekotism> How can I run commands through raku?

[13:37] <disbot6> <librasteve> you mean issue a command from your raku code?

[13:38] <disbot6> <librasteve> how about run? or maybe qx|cmd\ ?

[13:38] <disbot6> <librasteve> oops that backwhack should be a |

[13:41] <disbot6> <neekotism> Shell seems to work. I'm curious to how else you can do this.

[13:44] <disbot6> <librasteve> what problem are you trying to solve?

[13:44] <disbot6> <librasteve> if mainly curiousity, then the docs are pretty comprehensive...

[13:46] <disbot6> <neekotism> Nothing. I'm just automating a small task.

[16:24] <arkiuat> shell and run both return Proc objects, the first involving a shell and the second just running the command directly with no shell.

[16:24] <arkiuat> The qqx and qx quoting constructs run a command respectively with variable interpolation and without, and return the command's output.

[16:25] <arkiuat> Those are all the possibilities that come to mind at the moment, although you can do more elaborate things with Proc::Async
