[15:19] <arkiuat> jubilatious1_98524, this is true, but the docs also use the word "module" in two different senses, and that's probably much more confusing than that the IO::Path method slurp has nothing to do with "slurpy" being a term for the behavior one kind of Signature parameter

[15:19] <arkiuat> +Of

[15:25] <arkiuat> I guess it might be worthwhile to point that out though. Like two parentheticals, one in method slurp saying "No relation to L<slurpy parameters>" and then under the discussion of the latter "Nothing to do with <L IO::Path method slurp>"

[16:32] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @arkuiat I should get on Github and make a suggestion then. Maybe something like my-slurp() will be clearer? That way, newbies won't waste time looking up the in-built slurp() routine/method.

[16:50] <arkiuat> yeah, I don't think that's going to be any clearer at all.

[16:51] <arkiuat> How does sticking a my- on front clarify anything? I don't get it.

[16:59] *** ds7832 joined
[17:09] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @arkuiat Because no in-built Raku sub/method/routing will have my- prepended to it? Would you rather it read my-personally-modified-slurp() instead??

[18:28] <disbot1> <librasteve> I think we are stuck with the same term for reading from a file slurp and gathering all remaining arguments to a slurpy Array|Hash ... so my vote is to leave the code sub names alone and just have a short note that says do not confuse this with the file read routine called slurp

[19:18] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> It's just three letters: sub my-slurp(*@pos) { say @pos; }

[19:37] <ds7832> that code example (the second under https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Flattened_slurpy ) was introduced through a recent edit of mine. When I wrote it I must have been totally unaware of Raku.s own slurp() routine. The name should definitely be changed, IMO to something like "slurpy-routine" to leave no doubt that this has nothing to do with Raku's own slurp().

[19:40] <ds7832> I'll add it to my active PR

[20:02] <ds7832> Done: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4678/commits/18102e2d8d90b91c90937ed1f5463e4b57f3b0c2

[20:03] <ds7832> thanks for the hints

[20:25] <ds7832> By the way, this is the only place where the docs use the terms "Flattened slurpy" and "Unflattened slurpy". I think that more fitting would be the terms "Flattening slurpy" and "Non-flattening slurpy". This will then also match usage in https://docs.raku.org/type/List#Items,_flattening_and_sigils such as "Slurpy parameters (*@a) flatten non-itemized sublists"

[20:41] <disbot1> <librasteve> ds: I agree

[20:43] <ds7832> Thanks, very good to have this confirmed. I'm writing on an commit to implement this

[20:44] <disbot1> <librasteve> cool - its late for me now - so I will review tomorrow

[20:46] <ds7832> cool, have a good night!

[20:57] <arkiuat> jubilatious1_98524, now I get. I hadn't realized you were talking about an example sub in a newly rewritten part of the docs. I thought you were talking about changing the name of the IO::Path method!
