[08:56] <disbot1> <frostcod> Why doesn't this work under RakuAST?

[08:57] <disbot1> <frostcod> Is this reasonable/

[12:05] <disbot1> <librasteve> @frostcod I would defer to the AST experts on this one ... they often drop by when the sun comes up in California

[13:02] <disbot1> <frostcod> ok, I'm very curious about thisüòµ‚Äçüí´

[13:32] <disbot1> <nurturethevibe> Most actively maintained Discord package if any?

[14:12] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> looks like the whatever currying isn't being invoked for a hyper methodcall

[14:13] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> m: my &x = *.fmt("%02x", "").say; x Buf.new: [1,2,3,4];

[14:13] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Cannot resolve caller fmt(Buf:D, Str:D, Str:D); Routine does not have any candidates.  Is only the proto defined?   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[14:13] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> m: my &x = *.fmt("%02x", "").say; x Buf.new: [1,2,3,4];

[14:13] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Cannot resolve caller fmt(Buf:D, Str:D, Str:D); Routine does not have any candidates.  Is only the proto defined?   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[14:13] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> m: my &x = *.list.fmt("%02x", "").say; x Buf.new: [1,2,3,4];

[14:13] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  01020304 

[14:13] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> there we go, that's what i wanted

[14:14] <disbot1> <tpaul64_18694> you don't need to hyper or map .fmt if you .list the Buf first, because fmt on list will format the list elements and join them with the second string you provide

[15:20] <disbot1> <frostcod> Thx, that's a solution

[15:21] <disbot1> <frostcod> But I'm still confused about the different behavior in rakuast

[15:22] <ab5tract> frostcod: RakuAST still has some bugs to iron out. Would you mind filing a bug report?

[15:24] <disbot1> <frostcod> Sure, I'm willing to report

[15:29] <disbot1> <frostcod> I'm afraid I can only do it tomorrow...

[16:11] <ab5tract> frostcod: no worries! whenever is convenient for you
