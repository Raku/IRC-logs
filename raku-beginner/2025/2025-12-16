[01:54] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @rcmlz  @antononcube @librasteve I know this is gonna sound kinda selfish, but cracking 4K, 5K, or 10K points on StackExchange would go a long way towards getting people interested in Raku for DevOps: https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/227738/jubilatious1

[01:56] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Right now: 622/629 of my answers on Unix & Linux StackExchange mention "Raku". That's 98.89%

[02:18] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm... I do not know... My answers on StackExchange do not fair well. Except, if they are posted on MathematicaStackExchange.

[12:23] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @rcmlz Well...if I've posted 622 Raku one-liners and a substantial proportion (the majority?) have ZERO upvotes, that says to U&L StackExchange that the community isn't supportive.

[12:23] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> And if the community isn't supportive, why should anyone else adopt the language?

[12:35] <disbot6> <antononcube> Exactly that! I can say the same for my Raku packages. Granted, that is easily explained.

[12:38] <disbot6> <antononcube> Most people do not reach for Raku in their everyday tasks, and/or, treat Raku programming as hobby. I often read statements proclaiming the latter in some way.

[12:38] *** arkiuat joined
[12:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> These, BTW, are understandable.I personally, use Raku in professional settings only for the LLM workflows (very often) and for text processing or grammar-based parsing (ocassionally).

[12:42] <disbot6> <antononcube> And, yes, I have/had plans to use Raku for sysadmin tasks. (Very rarely I do.)

[12:50] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> weekly: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/803066/227738

[12:52] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube I'd happily upvote you packages if I knew where to do that!

[12:53] <disbot6> <antononcube> Let me be more constructive here. I have several related suggestions.

[12:54] *** arkiuat left
[12:55] <disbot6> <antononcube> 1. Make a Raku script -- or package -- that scrapes all answers of StackExchange user in a given community 2. Write and share)a JSON file with DSL examples for doing UNIX tasks with Raku (one liners)

[12:56] <disbot6> <antononcube> I assume given the package in 1, generating the JSON in 2 is via LLMs is possible and that hard.

[12:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> That JSON file with UNIX-by-Raku DSL examples is going to be included into "DSL::Examples", and, hence, be easily accessible by LLMs. We can run an all-Raku server that gives those relevant Raku one-liners (or multi-liners) upon request.

[13:01] <disbot6> <antononcube> Instead of doing 1 or 2, one can just: 3. Try to see are UNIX-by-Raku one-liners easily retrievable -- and correctly adjusted -- using a dedicated prompt with general LLMs.

[13:01] <disbot6> <antononcube> This might require significant prompt engineering and lots of experiments.

[13:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> I hope it is clear about the reason for this suggestions -- if LLMs easily and readily can produce functional Raku code for everyday tasks, then Raku's mindshare would increase.

[14:44] <disbot6> <librasteve> note that weekly bot is not working here (unless you get an ack)

[14:50] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @librasteve I got an ack...

[14:51] *** arkiuat joined
[14:51] <disbot6> <librasteve> @jubilatious1_98524 - I note that your posts start with "Using Raku (formerly known as Perl_6)" - since Perl is generally considered to be a dead language, I wonder if this is part of the problem - one major benefit of the rename is to cut the immediate link from raku to the perl legacy ... btw I would not judge upvotes as a negative on either raku or your (very nice) one-liners ... more a symptom of (i) wtf is raku

[14:51] <disbot6> (dont care), (ii) I do not have raku installed (pain), (iii) looks nice in raku, but I already prefer bash/perl/awk.

[14:53] <disbot6> <librasteve> <notable6> @librasteve_ Noted! (weekly)  <== this is what you are looking for ... I am pretty sure these acks are visible to all

[14:56] <disbot6> <librasteve> I think you could write a book! Even better would be a prompt setup where you put in what you want to do and get the raku one-liner back ;-)

[14:56] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube That solves the problem of adoption but not the problem of advertising. Upvotes are advertising. Sed, AWK, Perl, Ruby have tons of upvotes. So do csvkit, mlr,  etc.  A naive reader of the StackExchange forum would conclude that mlr is a better choice based upon upvotes--which of course it isn't.

[14:56] *** arkiuat left
[14:58] <disbot6> <antononcube> I was not clear - I want to be able to scrape answers of a particular user (say, you) and automatically make DSL examples.

[14:58] <disbot6> <librasteve> I 100% agree with that analysis - imo problem is that you (we) are trying to "boil the ocean" ... read this https://soloway.pbworks.com/f/Crossing-The-Chasm%20WHOLEBOOK.pdf

[14:58] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Oops, YOU got an ack... .

[14:59] <disbot6> <librasteve> ;-)

[15:00] <disbot6> <librasteve> the idea is to pick a small number of valuable "bridgehead" applications that are sustainably differentiated

[15:01] <disbot6> <antononcube> For the record, I am trying to speed up the coming of the next AI winter, so if @jubilatious1_98524 is trying to boil the ocean, that is very counterproductive.

[15:03] <disbot6> <librasteve> https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1pn9juu/2026_exemplars/ is my "starter" to have us as a community work out what these bridgeheads could be ... please do vote (btw Anton, I voted for "LLM Prompt Engineering") did you vote for it?

[15:04] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve I have to add the LLM opinions about Raku-for-LLMing in the GitHub page you created. I will do it later today.

[15:04] <disbot6> <antononcube> (Forgot to do it yesterday.)

[15:05] <disbot6> <librasteve> oh and the bridgehead apps should target small niche applications that are early on in their evolution and do not already have well established incumbents (which is where I think we are with unix one-liners, where AWK/SED/Perl/Ruby already have 99% share)

[15:05] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube well I will make it anyway as soon as I can find tuits

[15:06] <disbot6> <librasteve> I am just surprised that it is not winning the poll

[15:07] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> Not trying to boil the ocean, trying to become the "Jon Skeet" of Raku! https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/p6ot3w/oc_top_10_users_with_the_highest_reputation_in/

[15:11] <disbot6> <antononcube> This discussion makes think my 4th Raku advent post should be about Number theory visualizations, not code highlighting.

[15:12] <disbot6> <antononcube> The latter is a "solved problem" for many...

[15:12] <disbot6> <antononcube> ... And nobody get Number theory much...

[15:13] <disbot6> <librasteve> lol - btw Jon Skeet is a great illustration of what I mean, he entered the race early (2008) when there was little competition and was able to establish as the market leader in the short time in the early evolution when there is a chance to break in - after that, the market shares get kinda of frozen (due to the reinforcement effect of upvotes you mention) and the leaders hold their share broadly (bit of a horserace,

[15:13] <disbot6> sure ) throughout the rest of the market evolution

[15:14] <disbot6> <librasteve> as an extreme counter example, if you made a new SO group called rakuonelines.stackoverflow.com, then you would be the #1 (of nothing)

[15:16] <disbot6> <antononcube> I was thinking about that -- what does it take to make a new Raku StackExchange group.

[15:18] <disbot6> <librasteve> hmmm - would need to be a non-raku topic (that raku can be the leader of) - I have a yen for DSLLMs (Domain Specific Langiages for LLMs)
