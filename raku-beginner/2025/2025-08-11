[15:19] <thowe> librasteve, more like 100k real data.  Complete Deschutes County.  My major hold up was the fact that "HWY" is a valid street "type" and some people enter street names as "Hwy 58" or what have you.  But Hwy is not part of the street name, according to my records, it is the "Legacy Street Name Pre Type"...  And in fact "Highway" is the only legacy street name pre type in the database.  In this example, that would make the street name "58".  Wh

[15:19] <thowe> streets, and which one the county uses as the address appears to be up for grabs.

[15:20] <thowe> So, the logic needs to look for "Hwy" directly after the number and before any other alpha chars...  Kind of a pain that I worked around in the short term.

[15:36] <thowe> The single mass of data from the county, which appears to simply include outputs from multiple departments from multiple databases, tells a story of decades of address data norms changing and the efforts to deal with that.  The best data is from the e911 database, as it goes through some auditing, but the 911 data standards are changing again, so that's fun.

[15:39] <thowe> But I digress...  I will look at Contact

[15:48] <disbot4> <librasteve> thowe: thanks!

[16:03] <disbot4> <antononcube> BTW, the new version of "WWW:: OpenAI" supports GPT-5. It was somewhat tricky to hook up -- LLM providers can't help themselves, but make their APIs incrementally slightly inconsistent.
