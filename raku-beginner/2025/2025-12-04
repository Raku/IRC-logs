[07:40] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Can I change the default implementation of e.g. arrays? Lets say, I import a Role and instead of every time I am creating a new Array like  „my @a does SomeRole = 1,2,4;“ I change it once at the beginning of my script such that „my @a = 1,2,3,4“ is enough to get my improved List implementation?

[07:45] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Ideally I can attach two Roles, one containing my collection of „nifty tricks“ and one Role for specific stuff only needed for the task at hand, like „my @a does (SomeRole, SomeOtherRole) = 1,2,4;“

[07:46] <disbot6> <rcmlz> @nahita3882 thank you - let me check

[07:50] <disbot6> <nahita3882> in Rakudo's source, they use it for new language version additions, for example https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.e/Fixups.rakumod

[08:00] <disbot6> <rcmlz> That is what I was looking for - thank you.  As I am the only user of my tools I can safely ignore the warning, I guess.  „… this means modifying global state, which is strongly discouraged. For almost all situations, there are better solutions.“

[09:41] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Oh, that is very cool.  https://glot.io/snippets/hdl0juei53  Follow up question (but maybe that is than only possible in RakuAST). How would I ensure that I can chain my custom methods  say @a.adjacent-difference.is-sorted-until;  Is that something I can solve already?
