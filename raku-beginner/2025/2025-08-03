[11:29] <disbot4> <antononcube> @ng0177 Most likely, because you are mixing numbers and strings in the data.

[11:46] <ab5tract> @ng0177 you can use  -> Int() $x { ... } to ensure coercion to an integer (Num(), Rat(), etc are also available)

[11:57] <msiism> What's a good way to push hashes onto an array "by value" or create an anonymous copy and push that?

[11:59] <lizmat> are the hashes you push supposed to be mutable?

[12:00] <msiism> Yes.

[12:00] <msiism> Well, that would be nice.

[12:01] *** arkiuat left
[12:01] <lizmat> so, would it matter that if you push the same hash more than once, that changes in one would be reflected in the other ?

[12:02] <msiism> Yeah, pushing the same hash more than once would matter. The hashes represent web bookmarks with an id, url, description etc.

[12:03] <msiism> I'm trying to build an array that holds each bookmark once.

[12:04] <msiism> The loop fills a hash called %bookmark that is pushed to the array @bookmarks, when all the key-value pairs are in.

[12:05] <lizmat> ok, why are you using a hash, and not create a Bookmark class?

[12:05] <msiism> Lack of knowlegde. :)

[12:05] <ab5tract> :)

[12:06] <ab5tract> One major goal of Raku is to make class definition syntax so streamlined that reaching for it for its use cases comes as second nature

[12:06] <lizmat> class Bookmark { has $.id; has $.url; has $.description... }

[12:07] <ab5tract> *reaching for it for the relevant use cases

[12:07] <msiism> Okay, so this is a bit like a struct, I see.

[12:09] <msiism> I'll go read up on classes.

[12:09] <msiism> It would still be nice to know how to actually create an array of hashes, in case I ever need that.

[12:12] <lizmat> my @a = { a => 42 }, { b => 666 }, { c => 137 }

[12:17] <disbot4> <nahita3882> maybe you can do @arr.push: %bm.clone; if you don't want later changes to %bm effect the array

[12:17] <disbot4> <nahita3882> but if %bm gets renewed every iteration, then there is no risk of modification down the line?

[12:18] <lizmat> that'd be one solution: if no changes should happen to the hash after you push, you can also coerce it to a Map

[12:18] <lizmat> @arr.push: %bm.Map

[12:20] *** arkiuat joined
[12:24] <ab5tract> @ng0177: on second glance, the issue appears to be that @data should be an array-of-hashes

[12:25] *** arkiuat left
[12:28] <disbot4> <nahita3882> i think if they replace my @data = [ 'X', 'Sin(X)' ]; with my @data; it should work

[12:28] <disbot4> <nahita3882> library seems to accept array of arrays as well

[12:29] <disbot4> <nahita3882> yet another unfortunate instance an LLM isn't helpful compared to the documentation itself

[12:30] <msiism> ab5tract: Yeah, that was what I wanted it to be â€“ an array of hashes.

[12:31] <disbot4> <nahita3882> questions mixed up

[12:32] <msiism> Oh, right, my bad.

[12:41] <ab5tract> msiism: I think classes are a nice way to approach this. You can even create a Positional and override SET-POS to define the behavior your want to execute for duplicated entries

[12:42] <msiism> Interesting.

[14:20] <disbot4> <antononcube> @ng0177 After commenting out the first assignment to @data (i.e. my @data; # = [ 'X', 'Sin(X)' ];) and using the option format=>'html' I get this plot HTML file/plot:

[14:20] <disbot4> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1401570463708221521/Screenshot_2025-08-03_at_10.18.38_AM.png?ex=6890c1b6&is=688f7036&hm=172cdbb9330d4cb2e4d45af6062389c9da93cdba4060e0a4555ea98616ccb7fa&

[14:30] <disbot4> <antononcube> I am not sure why you put the first row of @data to be the array of strings ['X', 'Sin(x)'] -- this might be how Google Charts examples show plot data in their HTML/JavaScript code, or it can be "CSV thinking." There is no need in Raku for that and I consider it wrong. But if many people expect it to work I can make it a "guaranteed" functionality.

[16:03] <disbot4> <ng0177> Thank you, the code compiles w/o problems. I guess, something is wrong with viewing the html?

[16:06] <disbot4> <ng0177> I let Gemini create the code. I agree that the first line is an overhead.
