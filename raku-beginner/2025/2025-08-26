[01:27] <disbot8> <antononcube> @lucs Can be done with "direct" actions.

[01:28] <disbot8> <antononcube>  my grammar Baz2 {      token TOP { <D>+ {make $<D>».made} };      regex D { <Ds> <.Xs> {make $<Ds>.Str} };      token Ds { \d+ };      token Xs { x+ };  } 

[01:28] <disbot8> <antononcube>  Baz2.parse("111xx2xxx33x").made  # [111 2 33] 

[01:29] <disbot8> <antononcube> Not the same shape of the result you want, though

[01:31] <disbot8> <scullucs> Ah, interesting, and inspiring.

[01:31] <disbot8> <scullucs> Thanks.

[08:47] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> what does <.Xs> do compared to <Xs> ?

[08:51] <lizmat> m: say "aaa" ~~ / <alpha> /

[08:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56482941: OUTPUT: «｢a｣␤ alpha => ｢a｣␤»

[08:51] <lizmat> m: say "aaa" ~~ / <.alpha> /    # don't capture the named "alpha"

[08:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56482941: OUTPUT: «｢a｣␤»

[09:39] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> I dont get an error when I define and run a sub like this sub foo(*$name, *@args, *%opt) {*}, does it mean there is a meaning for *$ ?

[09:39] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> it behaves the exact same without the * in front of the $name

[09:43] <lizmat> I guess that could warrant a warning: but there's no such thing as a slurpy scalar

[09:50] <lizmat> hmmm... there do appear to be some spectests for it... weird

[14:07] <disbot8> <antononcube> @simon_sibl The dot makes the token "Xs" not to be taken into account -- or registered -- in the parsing result. In this case, though, that dot-spec is redundant because we are using direct actions.
