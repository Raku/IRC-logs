[22:01] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> Anyone using Net::AMQP. I've just started looking at it and it seems unusable. Perhaps I am holding it wrong.

[22:02] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> Like I filled a queue with 100k messages, and the consumer (following the examples, but changed to manually ack messages and set a limited prefetch/qos) is using 100% of 1 CPU and over 40MB of ram, yep only pulling 1 message/sec.

[22:11] <disbot1> <librasteve> @theoriginalwaffle I have not used it, but seems like it is actively maintained ... suggest you raise an issue on the module repository, perhaps?

[22:13] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> @librasteve Yeah, I'll do that. I just thought maybe I could catch someone here while I was actively looking at it.

[22:19] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> Even publishing those 100k messages it ate over 1GB ram.. which also is excessive. And freshly starting the consumer it hits 100% cpu and eats avoer 200GB of ram almost instantly.

[22:26] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> Is there a way to run tests on an already install module? zef test seems to want a path, which I assume would be the source repo.

[22:31] <disbot1> <theoriginalwaffle> I got the source and the version seemed to be the same as what zef reports and just did a 'zef test .' in the source repo. All good.
