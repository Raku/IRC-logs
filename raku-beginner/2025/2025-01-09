[07:29] <discord-raku-bot> <monkeyinthejuice> How do I making GRAPHICS in RAKU

[09:14] *** dakkar joined
[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For what purpose?

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There are some attempts to introduce generic graphics primitives in Raku, but they are all though some "external" library or system. (E.g. "raylib" or SVG,)

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not see how it can be done otherwise in any effective manner.

[13:31] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For data analysis (or data science) plots there are two JavaScrip-based packages. Both produce HTML files, but they are best used in Jupyter notebooks.

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <monkeyinthejuice> I wanting to making platformer in RAKU

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Someone else had similar proclaims, recently ... Lookup packages providing "raylib" bindings in Raku or similar.

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, see this blog post: https://raku-advent.blog/2023/12/08/day-8-make-it-snow-2-0-the-snowfall-strikes-back/

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <monkeyinthejuice> Wow !  Thank you

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <monkeyinthejuice> How do you playing music and sound in RAKU for video game

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> No idea. I have made LLM music notation generation and playing the result files in VS Code.

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is all I have done with Raku music-wise.

[17:49] <msiism> `if !True {say False;}` seems to return an empty list (`()`). I wonder why that is.

[17:49] <msiism> `if !False {say True;}` works just fine.

[17:51] <msiism> Uhhm… okay…

[17:52] <msiism> Doesn't execute the code block…

[18:05] <lizmat> the idea of a failed conditional, is that it returns the empty Slip

[18:05] <lizmat> m: say (^10).map: { $_ if $_ %% 2 }

[18:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 633df2893: OUTPUT: «(0 2 4 6 8)␤»

[18:06] <lizmat> inside maps an empty Slip disappears

[18:11] <msiism> I see.

[18:22] <lizmat> also, Empty is special in that it returns False with .defined

[18:22] <lizmat> m: dd Empty.defined

[18:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 633df2893: OUTPUT: «Bool::False␤»
