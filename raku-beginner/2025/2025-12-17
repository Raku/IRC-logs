[06:53] <korvo> I'm preparing to parse my LangJam language. Is the following example something that I could reasonably parse with a slang? If not, are there some easy tweaks to make it into a slang? https://gist.github.com/MostAwesomeDude/c5a28db8ec63f119f00692875a3a170f

[06:54] <korvo> (The scenario is some artistic critique of capitalism, written by a friend. I'm at the point where I need to fix the syntax so that they can express the rest of the scenario.)

[06:59] <korvo> Oh, I already found one mistake; Raku prefers scientific notation for big numbers. I do want to reuse Raku expression syntax and arithmetic.

[07:19] <disbot6> <rcmlz> @antononcube Is it possible to run Ollama as backend in Jupyter::Chatbook?  e.g. by setting environment variable  export OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434  and then use that as I would normally use OPENAI_API_KEY - sort of automatically?

[07:22] <disbot6> <rcmlz> If we want to have “out of the box working Raku LLM demos” having a local service as backend seems to me a good choice

[07:48] <ab5tract> korvo: Slangify appears to make it as simple as providing a grammar and an action : https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Slangify

[07:48] <ab5tract> I haven't actually used it yet, but its already powering quite a few slangs

[07:49] <korvo> ab5tract: Yeah! I also looked at packages like OO::Actors which are even simpler than that.

[07:58] <ab5tract> It depends on your definition of simple, I guess. OO::Actors does add a keyword or two but I'm not sure that it considers itself a slang

[07:59] <ab5tract> If you don't already have a grammar or an actions class, then yeah that approach almost certainly is simpler, or at least less work

[08:00] <ab5tract> SmokeMachine also has a few modules that add additional keywords, IIRC

[08:00] <ab5tract> (auth:fez:<FCO>)

[08:01] <ab5tract> borked the syntax there but I hope you catch my meaning

[08:17] <korvo> Thanks for the pointers. I'm fairly flexible on the actual syntax that I use. I'm kind of going for minimal effort; I have to technically create a new language and I figure that a slang is technically a new language.

[08:20] <korvo> I suppose I'm also wondering exactly how declarative a slang can be.

[10:13] <disbot6> <antononcube> @rcmlz I have to program an Ollama client in Raku. It is not that hard. (I think.)

[10:14] <disbot6> <antononcube> The “Ollama::Client” package will have Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries in its resources.

[10:14] *** arkiuat left
[10:15] <disbot6> <antononcube> I am not sure about the package name…

[10:16] <disbot6> <antononcube> @rcmlz Thanks for asking / reminding me about this?

[10:49] <SmokeMachine> korvo: if I was trying to implement that code you shared, I would probably start doing some custom ClassHOW keywords. An simple example for that I would say that is this module: https://github.com/FCO/ValueClass
