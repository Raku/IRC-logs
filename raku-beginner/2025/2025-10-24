[20:32] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Could someone please explain what is going on here? And where can I read about it in the docs?  Thanks! `` % raku -e 'my :(*@a) := [1,2],[6,7]; dd @a;' [1, 2, 6, 7]

[21:35] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Thanks, @SmokeMachine. I find this line in the docs to be confusing:  sub slurp(*@pos) { say @pos; } 

[21:38] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Doesn't Raku already have a slurp routine/method? Won't defining/re-defining slurp on the variadic page be confusing to newbies? https://docs.raku.org/routine/slurp
