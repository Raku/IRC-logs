[08:19] <disbot3> <holmdunc> IIRC, if you install rakudo-star instead of rakudo from Homebrew, this stuff gets taken care of. So no I don't think rlwrap is the best option

[08:34] <disbot3> <stu002> I did install that:   ❭ brew list -1 | grep rakudo rakudo-star

[10:10] <disbot3> <librasteve> @stu002 sorry to hear you are having this issue, I use rakubrew on macOS (Apple silicon) all the time and it works for me https://rakubrew.org/?platform=macos

[10:12] <disbot3> <librasteve> IIRC I usually need to go zef install Linenoise also on a clean mac account which may need brew install mimalloc to fix the issue you note

[10:22] <disbot3> <jubilatious1_98524> Maybe try brew install mimalloc first?  https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mimalloc

[10:37] <disbot3> <jubilatious1_98524> I've opted for Linenoise on MacOS. Historically, there were problems with rakudo seeing the correct Readline dylib (hopefully fixed by now). You could try installing Linenoise from source: https://github.com/antirez/linenoise
