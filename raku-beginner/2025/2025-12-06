[16:38] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @librasteve ...yes, I can't keep up with these 'beginners'!

[18:40] <disbot6> <librasteve> XDD

[18:41] <disbot6> <librasteve> otoh - I am still learning after 10 years ish

[18:44] <korvo> I'm considering using Raku for Langjam (https://langjamgamejam.com/) and I have to write a blogpost for that anyway. I'd be happy to write a post just about that, or a compound post including my Vixen compiler if I need more material.

[18:45] <korvo> But that would necessarily be for the 21st or later.

[18:47] <librasteve_> korvo: awesome! thanks … please do a quick PR at https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/main/raku-advent-2025/authors.md and reserve one of the later dates that works for you

[18:50] <ab5tract> korvo: you’ve definitely got my curiosity piqued! Is there anything online already where I can read more about vixen?

[19:04] <korvo> ab5tract: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Vixen is everything that one needs to get started. I've got about a dozen objects locally; I'm still seeing how far this approach can go. Working paper title is "Vixen: Obelisks for Nix" where obelisks are the recently-discovered RNA fragments.

[19:09] <ab5tract> Ok this is an amazing sentence that I surely was not expecting to read today:

[19:09] <ab5tract> “It is undecidable whether a Unix system interpreted as a Vixen object graph will respond to a given message.”

[19:10] <ab5tract> Such an interesting idea for an esolang

[19:11] <korvo> It's not mine; I strongly recommend reading Jakubovic's blogpost and paper. I'm still rereading https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com/2025/01/21/the-unix-binary-wants-to-be-a-smalltalk-method-not-an-object/ to try to understand.
