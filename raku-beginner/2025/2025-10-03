[07:32] <sibl> how come this works ?

[07:50] <disbot3> <librasteve> sibl: possibly this is a compiler bug, please can you raise an issue in the rakudo repo?

[15:00] <ds7832> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_.=  In this section, I have difficulty understanding what exactly is meant by the "postfix mutator". Could someone please explain?

[15:22] <arkiuat> ds7832, that's a great question. I think perhaps the wording of that part of the doc should perhaps be clarified.

[15:23] <arkiuat> I'd submit a pull request right now if I was certain what it was trying to say there, but I'm still unclear on it myself.

[15:33] <disbot3> <librasteve> this is the postfix mutator https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#methodop_.= your link shows that the precedence of $a.=abs is a little different to that of $a .= abs (note that the difference between postfix and infix is just the use of whitespace)

[15:34] <disbot3> <librasteve> tbh I don’t think the wording is too bad, but perhaps cross linking to the other operator would clarify (please submit a PR on the docs site if you wish)

[15:37] <ds7832> Ah, this makes things very clear.

[15:41] <ds7832> I'm writing on a PR now.

[19:09] <lnnk> Is raku simular to perl 5 or completely different?

[19:13] *** arkiuat left
[19:13] <ds7832> Similar in spirit I would say (both have been chiefly designed by Larry Wall, after all), but different in lots of places. You can take a look at https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell

[19:13] *** rantanplan is now known as snonux

[19:20] <ds7832> Do you come from a specific background programming-wise?

[19:22] <lnnk> Learning perl for a week now.I have Java and kotlin android app development background

[19:25] <stanrifkin_> I've always thought of Perl as portable Unix. And Raku as Perl on steroids.

[19:26] <lnnk> I herd about raku From some irc group.and came here.is there a active raku community?

[19:28] <stanrifkin_> It's here I would say

[19:28] <stanrifkin_> https://raku.org/nav/1/community

[19:34] <lnnk> Are new programmes and software being written in this language?

[19:35] <stanrifkin_> In Raku?

[19:39] <disbot3> <librasteve> there are a lot of coders enjoying raku for personal projects and contributing to the raku module ecosystem (take a look at the weekly back issues to get an idea of the level of activity https://rakudoweekly.blog/blog-feed/)

[19:40] <lnnk> Yes in raku.I heard pearl is dead no new softwares are being created

[19:41] <disbot3> <librasteve> there are a handful of commercial projects - often these are where perl used to shine such as ad hoc scripts and so on - but raku adoption in business is not yet well established (so not really a jobs market)

[19:43] <disbot3> <librasteve> since the ecosystem is relatively new - there is an open invitation to get involved and collaborate - either at the core level (where work on RakuAST is the current focus) or to flesh out the ecosystem if you are more interested in that

[19:56] <ds7832> What I find most motivating about Raku is that it has a good chance of raising the productivity of the open-source community at large: https://web.archive.org/web/20230322225205/https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto-3

[19:59] <ds7832> That, and it being just an extremely well-designed language with pleasant things at every corner

[20:02] <lnnk> Ok thank you ruku successor of perl 5.new ecosystem.
