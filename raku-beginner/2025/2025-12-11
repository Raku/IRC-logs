[10:37] <disbot6> <neekotism> Are there any cool features of raku that I should know about? I'd like to hear about it.

[10:37] *** arkiuat left
[10:38] <lizmat> compared to what ?

[10:39] <lizmat> sometimes it's the little things, like being able to specify    :$foo    as a named parameter, which is short for   :foo($foo)

[10:41] <disbot6> <antononcube> @neekotism "Best in class" LLM functionalities. Grammars as first class citizens. Easy making of CLI script in complicated arguments.

[10:41] <disbot6> <neekotism> Anything you like.

[10:48] <disbot6> <antononcube> This is a good LLM question, BTW.

[11:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm... Grok disagrees with me that Raku has the "best in class" LLM functionalities. (Thinks, it is only 2nd best...)

[11:03] <disbot6> <antononcube> I might cancel my Grok-subscription soon.

[11:07] <lizmat> Grok has a bad teacher

[18:38] <disbot6> <murilo04098> I've just began learning myself, but i think gather/take is pretty cool

[18:40] <disbot6> <librasteve> the raku.org website main page is intended to be a set of distinctive & cool features of Raku (and, yes, there are many!)
