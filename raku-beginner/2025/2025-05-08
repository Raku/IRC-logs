[16:43] <Awonder> Hey everyone

[16:44] <Awonder> What editor / IDE do you use when coding in Raku?

[16:44] <Awonder> Can't seem to find anything that would work for me + just wanted to hear what ppl actually use

[16:46] <stanrifkin> Not doing much Raku lately. But I just used vim.

[16:46] <stanrifkin> I think on the website are some recommendations.

[16:47] <stanrifkin> https://raku.org/whatever/

[16:47] <Awonder> Seen that already

[16:47] <Awonder> Just as an example, the vscode extension doesn't really work.

[16:48] <Awonder> Or at least it didn't work out for me.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I use IntelliJ Universal (with Raku plugin v2) more and more, and vi still much

[16:48] <Awonder> Interesting

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @antononcube is maybe able to help on the VSCode setuo - I know he uses Raku in Jupyter Notebooks in vscode

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> here's how intellij looks https://harcstack.org

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> plus it has Grammar debugging

[16:51] *** Guest74 left
[16:55] <Awonder> I'll check it out if I don't find anything else, but generally not a fan of JetBrain IDEs.

[16:55] <Awonder> Thanks.
