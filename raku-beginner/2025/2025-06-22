[10:31] <disbot2> <antononcube> @ng0177 1) It seems you have executed that cell multiple times. 2) For what you are trying to do use the magic #% chat perl prompt, … — that will create a new chat object every time it is executed.

[12:42] <disbot2> <winfredraj> Hello all, is anyone of you able to use Grammar Preview in the Comma plugin?

[12:43] <disbot2> <winfredraj> I get an error saying " Failed to compile grammar" even though the same text works when I run the script

[12:54] <lizmat> ab5tract ^^

[15:08] <disbot2> <librasteve> lemme check

[15:16] <disbot2> <librasteve> @winfredraj I get a different error - no such method 'parse' for iinvocant of type 'Any' ... but not working

[15:17] <disbot2> <librasteve> please can you raise an issue on the Comma plugin repo?

[15:40] <disbot2> <winfredraj> It's crashing frequently as well, I'll see if I can send a report

[16:19] <disbot2> <librasteve> @winfredraj use Grammar::Tracer; is my goto for this

[16:20] <disbot2> <winfredraj> No no, my grammar is OK, parsing is OK. But if I paste the same text in the preview window it gives an error.

[16:23] <disbot2> <librasteve> well I am saying if the Intellij plugin is failing, there is an alternate to debug your grammar - obviously you don't need either if your grammar is working ;-)

[18:14] <disbot2> <ng0177> Much appreciate the steadfast and spot on help. All works now as expected. It is also a great effort to develop such a framework in the first place.
