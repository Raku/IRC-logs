[01:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> would anyone want to help a humble raku beginner spruce up their scripts

[01:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> show me the light on how things could possibly be done

[01:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> perl for dir(test => rx{:i '.' mov $}) -> $filename {     say $filename;     run 'ffmpeg', '-i', $filename, "frames/{$filename}%05d.png"; }  indir( "frames", {     my @frames = dir();     @frames .= @frames.pick(@frames);     my @ordered = map {$_ ~ ".png"}, 1..@frames;     say @ordered;     for @frames X @ordered -> $source, $dest {             say $source;             say $dest;             move $source,

[01:49] <discord-raku-bot> $dest or die "nah";     } }); 

[01:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> ive gotten to here, but i need my @frames to be their basename instead of the IO::Path object i think, thats why move is dying (i think)

[02:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> i ask for someone to tell me what the heck i could do better

[02:34] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I wouldn't say anything is wrong with it honestly

[02:35] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> there are things you could do differently, but I don't know if they're better

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> map {$_ ~ ".png"}, 1..@frames could become (1..@frames) »~» '.png'

[02:39] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> also, isn't this going to mix different videos?

[02:40] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> or maybe that's intended

[03:24] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> thats the intention!!

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> i had the thought of taking all the videos i have in a folder and combining all the frames together

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> like im playing 52-card pickup

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nikshalark> even if theres nothing wrong, id like to know how else i could do this

[05:24] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> you could get rid of some variables with something like this  indir('frames', {     for dir.pick(*) -> $source {         state $i++;         move $source, "$i.png" or die 'A horrible death';     } });
