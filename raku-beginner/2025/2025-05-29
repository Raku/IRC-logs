[14:25] <disbot1> <rcmlz> @librasteve regarding your request for comment for raku.org - maybe the ‚Äúif you declare your script to use e.g Raku 6.d you can always upgrade the rakudo environment fearlessly ‚Ä¶‚Äù feature is worth emphazising. Can not login to github right now, thats why the comment via this channel. https://github.com/librasteve/raku-org-25-proto

[14:27] <disbot1> <rcmlz> but perhaps in times of containers, flatpacks and nixos-way this is not so much of a feature.

[14:28] <disbot1> <rcmlz> I like that my very old (Perl) scripts still work - hope this holds true for the stuff I am doing in Raku too

[14:37] <disbot1> <rcmlz> thinking about the ‚Äûcode example‚Äú section - would it not be cool to have all code examples ‚Äûrunable‚Äú, so people can press a button? The concept is called ‚ÄûUse-Modify-Create‚Äú in teaching.

[14:46] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Maybe there is even an HTMX-element that can do that securely on the web-server so that Jupyter or similar is not needed ‚Ä¶

[14:50] <disbot1> <librasteve> https://glot.io/snippets/h7sotvz66u <= like this?

[14:52] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Yes, but initially only the source code (nicely highlighted) and the ‚ÄûRun‚Äú button. Inly when it got executed the output is shown.

[14:53] <disbot1> <librasteve> my preference, if we want to have runnable snippets on new raku.org, that we link out to glot.io (or similar) because I don‚Äôt want to risk the site going down through malicious code

[14:54] <disbot1> <librasteve> from a design pov I am pretty allergic to gadgets too :-)

[14:55] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Yes, how this can be done technically is also important. Just wanted to mention that ‚ÄûUse-Modify-Create‚Äú exists and people in CS education like it :-)

[14:56] <disbot1> <rcmlz> If teachers like Raku, maybe its gets used in education more, which might lead to more Rakoons once they grown up ‚Ä¶

[14:56] <disbot1> <librasteve> but doesn‚Äôt having a ‚Äútry it now‚Äù link that opens the snippet in glot.io provide that?

[14:57] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Most website do not want the users to leave - if another tab opens maybe the user does not come back

[14:58] <disbot1> <rcmlz> But I guess it is far to early for technical details

[14:59] <disbot1> <rcmlz> During brain storming we should focus on ideas, not obstacles

[15:04] <disbot1> <librasteve> lol - i did break the rules of brainstorming that‚Äôs true - but i want to be realistic about expectations for this project  - making and maintaining a public raku sandbox is not on the table - this is about a small, attractive and effective static website

[15:07] <disbot1> <rcmlz> https://glot.io/api

[15:08] <disbot1> <librasteve> a broken link :-)

[15:09] <disbot1> <rcmlz> oh, did not click further - lol

[15:10] <disbot1> <rcmlz> anyhow, was just an idea, and we are in the wrong channel :-)

[15:14] <disbot1> <librasteve> yeah ‚Ä¶ but it goes to my point that a year from now if we choose to integrate to the glot api when they change something we likely will not even notice something is broken since the maintainer tuits should be considered minimal

[15:20] <disbot1> <librasteve> https://glot.io/snippets/h78lxqki6p

[15:20] <disbot1> <librasteve> ^^^ looks like glot has some abuse

[15:32] <disbot1> <rcmlz> what can I see there?

[15:34] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Some suspicious looking links?

[15:40] <disbot1> <librasteve> yes

[15:40] <disbot1> <librasteve> i have raised an issue in the glot io source repo

[15:49] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Knowing that dynamic is out of scope, I had a look what other ‚Äúnewcommers‚Äù have. How about something like that in v2? https://tour.gleam.run/table-of-contents/

[15:51] <disbot1> <rcmlz> does not even has a run button - just executes on change

[15:51] <disbot1> <rcmlz> nice

[15:55] <disbot1> <librasteve> its lovely (I certainly will steal from it) - tbh I am not convinced that a sandbox on the main site is necessary to make a language successful - but I see the attraction and the gleam one is well implemented - btw I note that their site does not work in dark mode ;-)

[15:55] <disbot1> <librasteve> (I mean I will steal design and content ideas from the home page)

[15:56] *** timo joined
[16:07] <disbot1> <librasteve> I would say the set of comparable benchmark sites is something like Python, Rust, Zig, Ruby, Go (happy to consider others but these seem to be a representative set of successful and relatively new languages) - of these only Go has a sandbox on or linked from the home page

[16:28] <disbot1> <antononcube> Python ü§Æ, Rust ü§Æ, Zig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è , Ruby ü•Ä , Go ‚Ü™Ô∏è

[16:28] <disbot1> <librasteve> haha
