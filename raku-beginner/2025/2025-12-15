[14:04] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Did you notice that Thiobe is not showing Raku anymore?

[14:04] <disbot6> <rcmlz> https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

[14:06] <disbot6> <antononcube> Yeah, but R is up.

[14:06] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Perl is back in Top 10 too

[14:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> I blame @jubilatious1_98524 . (I conjecture he apparently uses R more often than Raku.)

[14:07] <disbot6> <rcmlz> LOL

[14:10] <disbot6> <librasteve> realistically, Raku has O(10^3) community and (e.g.) Python has O(10^7) - I think that in 2026 we should focus on getting from O(10^3) to O(10^4) ... so we need 9000 recruits to do this which is 0.1% of Python coders ...

[14:11] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Maybe it is time for a DDOS to google.com using „Raku language“ as search string or alternatively everytime „raku“ is started on any machine it fires up an async task that executes a couple of queries to search engines.

[14:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> the real question is not "why are we so low in the rankings" but how can we get an "attention, interest, decision" loop going in the wider dev world...

[14:12] <disbot6> <librasteve> @rcmlz lol

[14:12] <disbot6> <rcmlz> Or we sneak in a Python module „numpyr“ or similar named that does that

[14:13] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve Yes and 10^5 or them a AI-bots.

[14:14] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve  > "why are we so low in the rankings" but how can we get an "attention, interest, decision" l Because of Raku's LLM packages. (I think, I am not sure...)

[14:16] <disbot6> <librasteve> OK - let's make a raku.org page for that ... and see if we can get some traction

[14:17] <disbot6> <librasteve> interested?

[14:17] <disbot6> <antononcube> You about LLms -- of course!

[14:18] <disbot6> <librasteve> yes Raku LLM

[14:18] <disbot6> <librasteve> cool ...

[14:18] <disbot6> <antononcube> I recently checked Google's opinion about that -- it is pretty favorable.

[14:19] <disbot6> <antononcube> (Google's AI opinion about Raku's LLM functionaliies.)

[14:20] <disbot6> <librasteve> here's an issue ... https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/284

[14:20] <disbot6> <librasteve> pleaes chuck your ideas in here

[14:22] <disbot6> <rcmlz> I am currently more in the humoristic side: Alternatively we are making the server behind „raku.org“ constantly fire „Raku Language“ queries when idle? (maybe via some thor/onion, to get different IP addresses anf AI changed queries to fake it?) as long cost of running the server do stay the same?

[14:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> hmm ChatGPT says that Raku LLM lacks the maturity of Pythin, Rust, JS options https://chatgpt.com/share/69401996-13e8-8009-9012-3ed9b9c433ae ... do you have ink or text to Google opinion ?

[14:24] *** arkiuat left
[14:26] <disbot6> <antononcube> ChatGPT does not know shit!!

[14:27] <disbot6> <antononcube> I am looking through my saved searches / requests...

[14:34] <disbot6> <antononcube> Just made a new search / comparison:

[14:34] <disbot6> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1450133946942619740/Raku-vs-Python-and-Java-over-LLM-functionalities.png?ex=69416dfb&is=69401c7b&hm=43a00df964e615c30a68bb8a30674f9155594125c48b4a06b65d50140c164e33&

[14:35] <disbot6> <librasteve> cool - please can you post this text in the issue so that I can find it later?

[14:36] <disbot6> <antononcube> Here is the initial query:

[14:36] <disbot6> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1450134499987034122/Google_for_What_are_Rakus_LLM_functionalities.png?ex=69416e7e&is=69401cfe&hm=1fec14d7bdd961a4de4074f6cf8e687df821008d69c1a590b589b1c23d9925df&

[14:37] <disbot6> <antononcube> I will do that after 2-3 hours. (Have to do things at work...)

[14:37] <disbot6> <librasteve> tx! - I will do some mulling
