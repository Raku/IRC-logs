[06:41] <disbot2> <ng0177> I ran a benchmark: GPU is about 4x faster on my hardware.  time ./llamafile -ngl 999 <<EOF Translate the following German text into English: $(cat translate.txt) EOF  i9:78s i9 RTX 3060: 17s

[07:12] <disbot2> <antononcube> Which model / llamafile ?

[07:13] <disbot2> <ng0177> Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q4_0.llamafile

[08:16] <disbot2> <ng0177> Does an equivalent to #% chat gc prompt, model=gpt-4o, max-tokens=4096 with the accompanying directions exist for #% llama?

[12:28] <disbot2> <antononcube> @ng0177 There are two types of LLM magic cells: 1. Direct access of LLM services providers    - Each of them is for a “stateless” execution 2. Chat cells, each associated with a chat object    - Those maintain “state”,     - I.e. chats with them are “global” across the whole notebook

[12:30] <disbot2> <antononcube> The magic spec “#% llama ,,,” means direct access to a LLaMA model

[12:36] <disbot2> <antononcube> A chat object cell magic can include provider and model specs. For example:  #% chat per1, conf=gemini,  model=gemini-2.0-flash, max-tokens=8192 

[12:36] <disbot2> <antononcube> To use LLaMA models in the chat object cells “conf=llama” has to be specified.

[12:37] <disbot2> <antononcube> If the LLaMA model URL is different than the default one the argument “base-url” can be used to specify it.

[12:48] <disbot2> <antononcube> I was asked similar LLaMA questions before (by @rcmlz) -- I think I made a didicated notebook. I will find it and post it later today.
