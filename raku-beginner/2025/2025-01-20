[12:59] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2025/01/20/2025-03-cro-released/

[13:21] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Given a bitstring like 0101010001101111011011000110110000100001 which is utf-8 of some Unicode characters, how could I convert that to the caracters?

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> assert ...("0101010001101111011011000110110000100001") == "Toll!" assert ...("01001000 11000011 10100100 00111111") == "Hä?"

[13:28] <lizmat> m: say "0101010001101111011011000110110000100001".parse-base(2)

[13:31] <lizmat> m: my $zo = "0101010001101111011011000110110000100001"; my $b = Buf.new; $b.write-bits(0,$zo.chars,$zo.parse-base(2)); dd $b.decode

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Thank you very much!

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... these number base questions/answers make me consider publishing a Number theory related post.

[13:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I might do it today, since it is a holiday here.

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> My students shall transform bitstrings manually to characters - I just x-checking my master solution ;-)

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Anton, ist that Number theory? We do that under the label "Introduction, Data, Representation, Codings"

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> ... but I was confident, that Raku has a one-liner for me ...

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> and was not disapointed. thanks to Liz.

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I implemented in "Math::NumberTheory" the functions: - digit-count - integer-exponent - real-digits - phi-number-system which are related to number-base conversions.

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, Raku has some nice built-in Number theory functions, like, base, mod, polymod, is-prime. They somewhat lack generality, hence I made the functions mentioned above.

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> ok, than "bitstring to character" might be a good fit too.

[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think I have to write a few posts with "Math::NumberTheory", and / or make "neat examples" videos, in order to show what can be done.

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My biggest "problem" is that I am not a Number theory fan (let alone expert), hence many of my implementations have only the basic, easy to understand algorithms and not most efficient ones.

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It seems "bitstring-to-character" is a "lower level" function than what "Math::NumberTheory" deals with. (But maybe it is not.)

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, the built-in complex- and bignum arithmetic of Raku makes it a very good language to extend with Number theory functions.
