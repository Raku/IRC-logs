[14:04] <disbot6> <rcmlz> @antononcube  I am considering to get Jupyter::Chatbook and/or Jupyter::Kernel into https://jupyenv.io/ - basically some predefined configurations to make data science work reproduceable. Unsure which one is more suited? Any (biased) opinion?

[14:08] <disbot6> <librasteve> I use Jupyter::Chatbook - I prefer since it has a lot of the raku modules (especially LLM) preloaded

[14:09] <disbot6> <antononcube> Both should work for visualizations based on "JavaScript::D3", and, to use the LLM packages. "Jupyter::Chatbook" main "upgrade" is having notebook-wide chat cells, and additional cells for using "on the spot" Wolfram|Alpha, DeepL, and Mermaid-JS.

[14:10] <disbot6> <antononcube> It is also important to think in what style you going run the notebooks: classical or JupyterLab.

[14:10] <disbot6> <rcmlz> JupyterLab is what I use

[14:11] *** arkiuat joined
[14:11] <disbot6> <antononcube> Ok. With that "JavaScript::D3" currently does not work. But "JavaScript::Google::Charts" should.

[14:15] <disbot6> <rcmlz> OK

[14:16] *** arkiuat left
[14:16] <disbot6> <antononcube> "Text::Plot" always works! (And, yes, it is preloaded in "Jupyter::Chatbook".)
