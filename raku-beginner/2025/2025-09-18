[13:16] <disbot1> <antononcube> @simon_sibl Are you trying to run Raku on your iPad? (I.e. "locally" not accessing a server running with Raku installed.)

[13:17] <disbot1> <antononcube> I considered to start investigating how to run Jupyter with Raku kernel on iPad. (There are some prior solutions.)

[14:01] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> I try yes, currently on iSH but I canâ€™t make it work..

[14:02] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> If you tried Jupyter, you got raku to work ?

[14:02] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> So far with iSH I can get my code editor (eMacs) to work and syncthing to get my coding projects  But raku and guix donâ€™t work unfortunately   I tried UTM SE, but itâ€™s way too slow

[14:03] <disbot1> <antononcube> No, as I said I just considered studying how to make a Raku-Jupyter app for iPadOS.

[14:05] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Would be glad to help xD if you start that adventure

[14:05] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Doing raku on the go would be nice

[14:05] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> But I canâ€™t even analyze why it segfaults

[14:10] <SmokeMachine> I would love if someone make Raku as a app for iOS as was made from Pythonâ€¦ https://apps.apple.com/br/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?l=en-GB

[14:13] <disbot1> <antononcube> I was looking iOS and iPadOS apps "Pyto", "Juno", and "Carnets plus"

[14:16] <disbot1> <antononcube> "Podlite", BTW, is a very good start for something like this. See: https://podlite.org .

[15:19] <arkiuat> I just moved the rest of my active personal repositories over to codeberg, so the only thing I'm using on github anymore are clones of collaborative Raku repositories (just Raku/doc at the moment)

[15:33] <disbot1> <antononcube> ðŸ¤”

[18:45] <disbot1> <holmdunc> SmokeMachine: There's a similar nice iOS app for Ruby https://rubyist.app and it too can integrate with the overall iOS automation system ("Shortcuts")
