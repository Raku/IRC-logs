[02:26] <korvo> What's the correct way to traverse the Match generated by a grammar fragment like (<first> <second>)+ ? It seems like $/.list is not the right move, $/.map(*<first>.made) doesn't work, and $/.map(*[0]<first>.made) sometimes works and sometimes produces Nil. I can't find any good examples of this pattern arising in example grammars with actions.

[03:04] <disbot6> <antononcube> Hmm… I would use .values …

[05:58] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> is there a similar method than tap in Ruby for Raku ? basically that allow to do some action with the object while still returning the object unmodified ?

[07:07] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @korvo assigning to an Array works.

[08:50] <disbot6> <rcmlz> @simon_sibl you mean like applying map to an array, changing the array and return the original array?

[08:55] *** dakkar joined
[08:56] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> I mean like @arr.map({$^obj.dosmth.tap({.say})}).sum for example here the tap would print all the object and return the object, not the returned value from the inside code

[13:06] <disbot6> <antononcube> @korvo Yes, using $/.values works.

[13:07] <disbot6> <antononcube> Here is an example:   my grammar MyGrammar {     token TOP { (<first> <second>)+ }     token first { <alpha>+ }     token second { \d+ } }  my class MyActions {     method TOP($/) {         make $/.values.map({             "1:{.<first>} 2:{.<second>}"         }).join('; ')     } }  my $text = 'foo1bar2baz3'; my $match = MyGrammar.parse($text, :actions(MyActions)); say $match.made;  # 1:foo 2:1; 1:bar 2:2; 1:baz 2:3 

[14:48] <korvo> antononcube: Very nice, thanks!

[14:49] <korvo> jubilatious1: Like, `my @arr = $/;` ? Yes, that does work, thanks.

[14:50] <korvo> FWIW I refactored that production and generated an AST; manipulating the AST is a zero-magic situation. But I appreciate knowing how to handle it in the future.
