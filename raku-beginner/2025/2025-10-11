[08:51] <habere-et-disper> Can raku adverbs not have hyphens?

[09:36] <disbot6> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: thanks for your questions ... remember that the Raku language is formally specified by the ROAST test suite ... so, if you cannot find the answers to questions like this in docs.raku.org, then the best way to find out the answers is to "ask the compiler" (since that passes the tests)
