[19:26] <disbot1> <rcmlz> I was reading in the rakudoweekly about the "Print lines that have no duplicates in a file and preserve sort order" discussion where @jubilatious1_98524  made an advanced Raku example.  I was wondering if that could be made more appealing and simple for people first looking at Raku. Here is my take  https://glot.io/snippets/hb59kbbv7z   and my question is: can I improve in line 20? How to get the keys of a Bag?

[19:28] <disbot1> <rcmlz> (there are only 3 lines of code - no worries about that "line 20")

[20:39] <disbot1> <nahita3882> you can do >>.key to make it a little shorter

[20:40] <disbot1> <nahita3882> but by making an Array and looking in it is O(N)

[20:42] <disbot1> <nahita3882> so in theory, the following is faster perl my %counts := @numbers.Bag; .say for @numbers.grep({ %counts{$_} == 1 }) 

[20:43] <disbot1> <nahita3882> as hash (bag here) lookup is O(1)
