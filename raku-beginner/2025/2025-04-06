[08:37] * lizmat wonders what it is

[10:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Matou> Hi ! Is there a simple way to print on stderr ?  In some old perl tutorials they say :   say STDERR "hi stderr\n";  but it doesn't work here.

[11:01] <lizmat> note

[11:01] <lizmat> is the same as "say" but on STDERR

[11:02] <lizmat> m: note "something wrong"

[11:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7b0f03ea7: OUTPUT: «something wrong␤»

[11:14] <discord-raku-bot> <wambash> m: $*ERR.say: "hi stderr\n";

[11:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  hi stderr\n 

[11:15] <lizmat> wambash indeed, that also works, but why not use "note"  ?

[11:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Matou> thanks liz & wamba ! note looks good

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> note also flushes the pipe afaict

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [Coke] https://github.com/nkh/P6-Data-Dump-Tree/issues/60#issuecomment-2781470322 I had it in mind to wait 2-3 days out of courtesy and then treat as unresponsive author if they are err unresponsive

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ie move to raku community modules
