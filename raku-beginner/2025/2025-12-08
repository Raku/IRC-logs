[19:11] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve I mulled over our conversation yesterday, we could basically make Air::Components work with Datastar as long as the methods are completely stateless

[19:12] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> They just take in input and put out JSON, HTML, etc

[19:16] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> There could also be a trait is datastar or emits datastar

[19:16] <disbot6> <librasteve> I did some research (not enough, but enough )to realise that DataStar is a neat way to make in browser components react to data changes ... so I am pretty on board with supporting both HTMX and DataStar in their respective strengths. I guess this means we need a way to specify the compomet initially (eg with method HTML ... but maybe need JS additionally?) and a way to feed data into the component (which I guess we

[19:16] <disbot6> already have with HTMX on the client side and method feed-me is controller { return the HTM fragment here }

[19:17] <disbot6> <librasteve> yeah, is datastar would be cool ... this is the point when I need demo code to really see the moving parts ;-)

[19:18] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> The thing is Datastar accepts one of four responses; text/event-stream, application/json, text/html, and application/javascript; it just does whatever it needs to do based on that response

[19:19] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> So if it's an SSE response then it just executes each event ad necessary

[19:19] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> If its HTML it does the same thing as HTMX

[19:19] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> If its JSON it patches the signals defined in the HTML

[19:19] <disbot6> <librasteve> yeah, well is controller is parameterised such as is controller[:C:R:U:D], so can follow that pattern

[19:20] <disbot6> <librasteve> my preference would be to sitck to HTML initially (since that is well aligned to HTMX)

[19:22] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> My idea for is datastar is that it just wraps whatever is in the method body in datastar, and like is controller we could parametrize it on the keyword to automatically place content 'text/html', $response at the end

[19:22] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> In the datastar block

[19:23] <disbot6> <librasteve> cool

[19:24] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> So like is datastar(:html)

[19:24] <disbot6> <aruniecrisps> Or is datastar(:json)

[19:26] <disbot6> <librasteve> @antononcube I haev taken a look at your Hilite::Simple in the new advent post and I can't understand what you are doing with it ... the only purpose of Hilite::Simple that I know of is you go > hilite myscript.raku > myscript.html and then post the output in a Custom HTML block in Wordpress - so not sure why you have it in your code??? Anyway, no big deal, I have left in B+W and OK for publish tomorrow...

[21:35] <disbot6> <antononcube> @librasteve Yes, using "Custom HTML" block works.
