[16:30] <disbot1> <mrmrmrglgl_00429> Hey everyone! What is the last version of Rakudo/Rakudo Star that still works on Windows 8.1 (I have a pretty old laptop)? The latest version gives me exceptions that are typical for programs that need Windows 10+ (something about a procedure being unable to find an entry point in a DLL or something like that). I tried to find that info but if it's there, it's pretty well hidden.

[16:49] <lizmat> mrmrmrglgl_00429 asking on #moarvm, but it looks like not an easy question to answer

[16:49] <lizmat> I suggest doing a bisect approach with rakubrew ?

[17:19] <disbot1> <mrmrmrglgl_00429> Thanks! I'll try doing that. I just hoped that that info is there somewhere. Windows 8.1 deprecation announcements are surprisingly hard to find sometimes but there're usually there. Sometimes in the form of Chromium bump or the Qt version being used but still üôÇ Oh well.

[17:23] <timo> one of the libraries we depend on for many cross-platform low-level operating stuff is libuv, so you could look when libuv deprecated windows 8.1

[17:24] <timo> if they don't have an official announcement for that, it's possible that libuv was the reason why node stopped supporting 8.1, so that may be a spot to look at as well

[17:24] <timo> other than that, the latest version that worked fine with the jvm backend may be a place to look? i'm not exactly sure which versions were good with jvm and which weren't, or for what exact reason

[17:26] <timo> maybe it's just a mattor of using an older MSVC to compile moar and the nqp and rakudo runners binaries to get it compatible again, or perhaps there is a compiler flag that you could pass?

[18:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> or try WSL ;-)

[18:51] <timo> it doesn't seem like WSL exists for windows 8 or windows 8.1

[18:59] *** stanrifkin left
[19:02] <disbot1> <librasteve> oh - just a thought

[20:38] <disbot1> <mrmrmrglgl_00429> Thanks again for the pointers! I'll look into libuv as well. WSL indeed isn't a thing in Windows 8.1.
