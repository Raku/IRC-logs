[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve "there's probably a whole essay on why raku is built on Seqs ..." -- I would be very interested to read it. I consider the Seq-centric behavior of Raku to be seen as "useless" or "too awkward" by lots of people.

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> IIRC, also R is known to work best if ‚Äûeverything‚Äú is treaded as a list (all the apply-magic works magically) - but beginners will usually go for ‚Äûtraditional‚Äú approaches and convert and ‚Äûunlist‚Äú

[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was thinking about that -- people familiar with the arcanity of R might accept the arcanity of Raku. This does not mean they will adopt Raku, though.

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Also, that is more for the "older generation" of R users. Newer R users are too accustomed to using "tidyverse", etc.

[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> ‚Äûolder generation‚Äú - LOL - let me tell you a story, my young fellow, about me discovering and learning ‚Äûapply‚Äú in R, back in the good old days, leaving the ‚Äûthere is nothing wrong with for loop‚Äú-boyz well behind ‚Ä¶

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Maybe the same is true for lazinesses/seq in Raku - needs effort to understand - but might pay-off quickly.

[15:40] <lizmat> perhaps I need to revisit https://dev.to/lizmat/series/20496

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> as an aside, what can be done to bring syntax highlighting of Raku code in dev.to

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i see that, e.g., Python snippets have it

[17:12] *** DarthGandalf joined
[17:26] <ab5tract> Ah, syntax highlighting:(

[17:32] <ab5tract> nahita3882: This is a decent overview of the current situation https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/422

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> thanks ab5tract
