[07:16] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> is there a good xlsx lib for Raku ? I tried to use https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Spreadsheet::XLSX but I get an error everytime when trying to access the $cells with [0;0]  Too few positionals passed; expected 2 arguments but got 1   in block  at /home/sibl/Documents/git/star/share/perl6/site/sources/22B14971541474027035F5EA10CC7FEAD3BA88D8 (Spreadsheet::XLSX::Worksheet) line 48   in method

[07:16] <disbot5> after worksheets to work otherwise .name on a list doesnt work  and https://raku.land/zef:FRITH/Spreadsheet::Libxlsxio, is simply impossible to work with for me

[07:16] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> I just need to be able to read the sheet, and the first library should be able to do it, but for some reason, it breaks

[07:27] <disbot5> <simon_sibl> well I will just use Spreadsheet::Read from Perl5  amazing Raku can just do that and even improve on the syntax xD

[08:12] <disbot5> <librasteve> lucs: thanks for clarifying, I tend to be of the “it works or it doesn’t work” mindset, so sometimes I don’t really get questions that probe stuff like “why does Raku do that”, or “how else can this be done” … mind you I learn a little bit every time

[08:13] <disbot5> <librasteve> lucs: maybe, if you have a nice idea (short summary) of exceptions, you could post as a gist and we can put that in the Raku Tips n Tricks in the weekly?

[08:16] <disbot5> <librasteve> SIBL: please can you raise an issue on Spreadsheet::XSLX and post the link here, I’ll try and take a look at it.

[14:55] <disbot6> <neekotism> Really? I'm interested.

[15:05] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> oh well, here is the very short code perl #!/usr/bin/env raku  use Spreadsheet::Read:from<Perl5>; use Template:from<Perl5>;  my $sheet = Spreadsheet::Read.new('sheet.xlsx').sheet(1); my @team  = $sheet.column(2)[1..*]; my @lang  = $sheet.column(3)[1..*]; my @rewa  = $sheet.column(4)[1..*]; my @cols  = <team lang reward>; my %db;  for @team Z @lang Z @rewa -> @row {     my %row-data = @cols Z=> @row;      for

[15:05] <disbot6> %row-data.kv -> $col, $val {     %db{$col}{$val}.push: %row-data;     } } 

[15:08] <disbot6> <neekotism> That's really cool. Does it work well?

[15:08] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> yep perfectly

[15:09] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> very nice feature

[15:09] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> without all the -> and @{$var} etc.

[15:10] <disbot6> <neekotism> That's very convenient. Has this always been a feature?

[15:13] *** arkiuat joined
[15:14] <ab5tract> neekotism: Inline::Perl5 pre-dates the original Christmas release of Perl 6 :)

[15:14] <ab5tract> nine++ for putting together a really solid piece of cross-language interfacing

[15:15] <ab5tract> simon_sibl: not a nitpick, just wanted to state my preference for [Z] when zipping multiple thingies

[15:16] <ab5tract> too many infix Zs and I start to get dizZy ;)

[15:18] *** swaggboi joined
[15:20] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> aah havent thought of that one, indeed can make it more readable

[15:21] <disbot6> <neekotism> Very nice. I never knew about this. It changes a lot of things for me.

[15:22] <ab5tract> neekotism: you can even compile your Perl with a switch that allows multiple Perl5 interpreters to run in the same address space

[15:23] <ab5tract> you can use Raku async goodness to coordinate code running across multiple Perl interpreters

[15:23] <ab5tract> *you can then use

[15:24] *** sjn joined
[15:29] <disbot6> <neekotism> I see! Thank you very much for telling me about it. I can imagine how powerful it is.

[15:36] <ab5tract> I hope it proves useful! Don’t hesitate any cool outcomes :D

[15:43] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> there are some equivalent (probably less feature than the Perl one) for Go and Python https://raku.land/cpan:AZAWAWI/Inline::Go https://raku.land/zef:slavenskoj/Inline::Python3 (I had more luck with Inline::Python since I dont use pyenv)

[15:44] <disbot6> <simon_sibl> perl #!/usr/bin/env raku  use Inline::Python; use string:from<Python>; use re:from<Python>;  say re::split('\W+', 'Words, words, words.'); say string::capwords('foo bar');    $ ./another.raku [Words words words ] Foo Bar 

[15:45] <disbot6> <neekotism> That's really cool.

[15:46] <disbot6> <antononcube> How hard it is to write a new MS Excel ingestion package from scratch? Is there a mainstream, non-corner-case format that is easy enough ingest?

[15:52] <disbot6> <librasteve> antononcube: note the issue that SIBL filed above ... may be simpler to get that to work ;-)

[17:19] <arkiuat> lucs, nahita3882, thanks! Now I understand what https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4658 is complaining about much better

[23:20] <disbot6> <antononcube> There several Raku packages interfacing to GTK (or GTK4.)
