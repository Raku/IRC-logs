[18:50] <habere-et-disper> What does the adverb o do and is there an easy way to look this sort of thing up in the docs?

[19:30] <ab5tract> Adverbs are specific to their respective functions

[19:31] <ab5tract> So the quickest way to find docs is to search for whatever is being fed the :o

[19:31] <ab5tract> (Operators being “funny named functions”, to paraphrase Larry Wall)

[19:35] <habere-et-disper> I don't know what is being fed the o as I'm reading the localization file for translation.

[19:37] <habere-et-disper> adverb-q-o in EN.l10n

[19:38] <ab5tract> That’s for Q

[19:38] <ab5tract> The quoting construct

[19:54] <disbot2> <jubilatious1_98524> Not sure where you're getting :o from? There's an :overlap adverb available for regexes, which can be abbreviated :ov. See: https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%3Aoverlap

[19:57] <ab5tract> You’re right, I just deduced from the filename mentioned. :o isn’t mentioned in the docs. :to is maybe the closest

[20:03] <ab5tract> adverb-q-* refers to Q, there’s no doubt about that from the source

[20:05] <ab5tract> lizmat : do you remember what ‘adverb-q-o’ refers to?

[20:06] * ab5tract thinks it might be nice to create a dictionary that maps these names to code snippet examples

[20:11] <disbot2> <librasteve> ab5tract++

[22:46] <lizmat> $ raku -e  'use L10N; say L10N.info-for-translation-key("adverb-q-o");'

[22:46] <lizmat> ab5tract librasteve ^^

[23:01] <ab5tract> lizmat: nice! But that still doesn’t help to understand what the o adverb is (it’s not mentioned anywhere on that page)
