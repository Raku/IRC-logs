[09:21] <habere-et-disper> Is this the expected behaviour? I was imagining it would catch the `27.return` and complain as well, no?

[10:12] <disbot1> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: the docs state If the type constraint is a constant expression, it is used as the return value of the routine. Any return statement in that routine has to be argumentless. https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Return_type_arrow:_--%3E

[10:17] <disbot1> <librasteve> this is the first I have seen a method variant of return ... it seems to me that (i) we need to either document the method form of return and make the compiler check this or (ii) decide that there is no such thing as a method variant of return and make the compiler reject it ... please can you make a Raku problem solving issue and maybe check if there are any ROAST tests for this?

[16:18] <habere-et-disper> Will do. Checking roast now. I use method chains a lot, so `.return` didn't seem unnatural.
