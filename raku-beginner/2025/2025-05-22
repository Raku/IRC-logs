[13:40] <disbot1> <gluonvelvet> Do you all think I should try to make a programming language in raku in the background while I'm learning it?

[13:59] <ab5tract> gluonvelvet: definitely :)

[13:59] <ab5tract> if that's something that interests you, that is

[14:00] <ab5tract> here's a relatively complete, if abandoned, language called Alma https://raku.land/github:masak/Alma

[14:01] <ab5tract> it's heavily oriented around exploring macros tho

[14:03] <disbot1> <antononcube> @Velvet Alternatively, consider implementing in Raku (a subset) of a programming language you already know.

[14:12] <disbot1> <gluonvelvet> Alright!

[14:12] <disbot1> <gluonvelvet> I'll try to learn today or tomorrow by scrounging together as many resources as possible

[14:30] <disbot1> <antononcube> LLMs would help.

[14:51] <disbot1> <librasteve> @velvet - that's quite a steep hill to climb - good luck! You may wan tto take a look at a prior example to get the hang of it https://raku.land/zef:guifa/Polyglot::Brainfuck

[15:03] <ab5tract> We need a befunge implementation next :)
