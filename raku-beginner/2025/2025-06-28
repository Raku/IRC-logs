[01:25] <disbot3> <romdav55_30502> Hi, im having a Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11:SIGSEGV) on mac, DB::MySQL just adding this line $db.query('select 34').value;

[01:26] <disbot3> <romdav55_30502> What can be wrong?

[05:33] <disbot3> <rcmlz> Hello @romdav55_30502   Sometimes it is helpfull to put a minimal code example illustrating the problem at e.g. https://glot.io/ or something similar such that it is easy for someone who want to replicate the error.

[08:49] <lizmat> romdav55_30502 segfaults shouldn't happen: if the line is really that simple to create a segfault, it feels like there is an issue with the installation of the DB::MySQL module or one of its dependencies

[10:25] <disbot3> <apogee> or mysql itself potentially?

[10:26] <lizmat> well...  for a query such as that: I think mysql has grown beyond that  :-)

[12:39] <disbot3> <apogee> If trying to select before a table exists -- I'd expect error not segfault, or corrupted data directory I guess would be more likely to segfault

[21:09] <disbot3> <tpaul64_18694> i wanted to try this with a mysql docker container and i can't get it to connect via host and port, it just tells me it can't connect through /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock which obviously doesn't exist because of course not

[21:13] <disbot3> <tpaul64_18694> ok it looks like it didn't like "localhost" but 127.0.0.1 made it work. and then the select Just Works as well

[22:59] <lizmat> heh... as always DNS  (assuming absence of /etc/hosts)
