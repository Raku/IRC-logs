[06:45] <disbot1> <ng0177> It turned out to be as simple as starting "rlwrap rakudo".

[06:55] <disbot1> <ng0177> On another note: which graphics library is recommend for beginners?

[07:02] *** jgaz left
[07:19] <disbot1> <antononcube> Depends what you want to do.

[10:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> ng0177 I think anton is asleep ‚Ä¶ but if you take a look at his LLM / Data modules on https://raku.land several use charting DS3.js iirc in jupyter notebooks (which you can run in vscode / intellij)

[11:06] <disbot1> <ng0177> librasteve Using jupyter notebooks with a raku kernel is appealing. I work under Arch Linux. It may be difficult to get it to work as a beginner. (any advice, anton?) On DS3.js iirc (typo?) I have not been able to find anything on Raku Land.

[12:13] <disbot1> <librasteve> on linux, you need to get jupyter running (usual python version) and then install the https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Jupyter::Chatbook module ... should be pretty straightforward

[12:26] <timo> i'm looking at the raku-jupyter-kernel repo. looks like the docker file wants to change from using the :daily tag (last pushed 2 years ago) to :latest (pushed earlier this year)

[12:27] <disbot1> <librasteve> timo: there's a slighly odd dymanic around Jupyter::Kernal

[12:29] <timo> i haven't tried it in a long while tbh, though i should try to use it a lot more

[12:29] <disbot1> <librasteve> the original was written by Brian Duggan, but Anton has forked it as Jupyter::Chatbook ... my suggestion for this kind of infra thing would be to raise an issue on Jupyter::Kernel (bduggan) and to have Anton upstream that

[12:32] <timo> well, anton has a little description why he decided to make a fork, among other things in order to do a lot of UX experimentation

[12:33] <disbot1> <librasteve> looks

[12:36] <disbot1> <librasteve> @antononcube I see you explanation of "why fork Jupyter::Kernel", my hope is that we can have an effective tech stack where I can get the same engine from vanilla Jupyter::Kernel and from Jupyter::Chatbook - of course Jupyter::Chatbook would have a lot of cool LLM goodies & UI stuff also so it may be a bit heavier, but well worth it for LLM use cases.

[12:38] <disbot1> <librasteve> my proposal is that you make Jupyter::Kernel a dependency of Jupyter::Chatbook and then use the same engine that way, another option would be to make Jupyter::Kernel a github submodule of Jupyter::Chatbook ...

[12:39] <disbot1> <librasteve> ... I am not sure how timo's concern about the docker version would work if you do this, but it seems to me in the long term that could sve you the effort to make changes to the upstream code

[12:43] <timo> the docker thing i'm worried about is just that the rakudo it gives you is very out of date

[12:45] <disbot1> <librasteve> timo: minimum I suggest to raise an issue for this on Jupyter::Kernel

[12:45] <timo> i was going to make a pull request :)

[12:45] <disbot1> <antononcube> @librasteve Thank you for your input. I think those are good ideas. I think they would have been more applicable at beginning of the project. Right now ‚ÄúJupyter::Chatbook‚Äù has refactoring that I cannot easily reconcile with ‚ÄúJupyter::Kernel‚Äù. Note that those packages are not actively worked on. So, manual update of features ‚Äî so far ‚Äî has not been difficult for me.

[12:45] <disbot1> <librasteve> brian is pretty good - but typical takes a few days to fix stuff

[12:47] <disbot1> <librasteve> timo: even better ... looks like the fork is a fork ... I am confident anton is watching any PRs on Jupyter::Kernel and reapplying on Jupyter::Chatbook if appropriate ;-)

[12:48] <disbot1> <librasteve> btw I use Jupyter::Chatbook all the time anyway ;-)

[12:49] <disbot1> <antononcube> I think I look into ‚ÄúJupyter::Kernel‚Äù repository: (i) when I see a new version of it published, (ii) every two-three months, regardless.

[12:50] <disbot1> <librasteve> cool

[12:51] <timo> ah, the Dockerfile in chatbook looks like it's already in a better shape than the one from jupyter::kernel anyway

[12:53] <disbot1> <antononcube> I have to evaluate my TODO items for ‚ÄúJupyter::Chatbook‚Äù. I think the biggest one is the streamlining of the additiona new types of cells. (How it is done in Python‚Äôs core Jupyter kernel code.)

[12:57] <disbot1> <ng0177> bash: jupyter-chatbook.raku: command not found  (sorry for a true beginner's question, zef install Jupyter::Chatbook went through w/o problems)

[12:57] <disbot1> <ng0177> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1381618131247693945/image.png?ex=68482ba7&is=6846da27&hm=3e8c48b6f85b101cd2e7c9d0574cfc52001ecf1830821cfee602ca83ab4a792b&

[13:00] <timo> right, it should tell you what you need to add to your path for that to be available, right?

[13:01] <timo> so you'd want to follow the link to the documentation of Jupyter::Kernel

[13:01] <timo> but maybe it would make sense for anton to steal that part of the documentation and just replicate it with the small change of the name of the script and module

[13:03] <timo> it would say something similar to this: 1 bin/ script [jupyter-kernel.raku] installed to:                                             

[13:03] <timo> /usr/share/perl6/site/bin                                                                                                                                                                    

[13:36] <disbot1> <ng0177> cube: ~/.raku/bin $ ./jupyter-chatbook.raku --generate-config I forgot the ./

[13:37] <timo> oh you were in the right folder already!

[13:43] <disbot1> <ng0177> but now running jupyter-notebook from $HOME ...

[13:43] <disbot1> <ng0177> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1381629714585747496/image.png?ex=68483671&is=6846e4f1&hm=eea721f43413bdc9886a8ad3bbfc390e0de79618928ad665292fee18877e86e0&

[13:44] <timo> OK, it really wants to be in the $PATH then

[13:56] <disbot1> <ng0177> That's it! Now, the question is how to load https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2024/12/01/graph-neat-examples-in-raku-set-1/

[14:04] <disbot1> <antononcube> I think I provied a link to the notebook in that post...

[14:05] <disbot1> <antononcube> ... yes, I did. See here: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Presentations/Notebooks/Graph-neat-examples-set-1.ipynb

[14:06] <disbot1> <antononcube> @ng0177 BTW, if you are using JupyterLab, the graphics output from "JavaScript::D3" won't work. (Or at least I do not know how to prime that notebook framework for that.)

[14:07] <disbot1> <antononcube> There are two options, using: (i) "JavaScript::Google::Charts", or (ii) VS Code.

[14:07] <disbot1> <antononcube> I really do not know is VS Code working at all on Linux, though...

[14:25] <disbot1> <ng0177> Appreciate. However, Graph is not found - needs to be installed but how?

[14:34] <timo> it's a package called just Graph that you can install with zef

[14:34] <disbot1> <antononcube> Do you mean the package "Graph"? Should be installable with zef install Graph.

[14:35] <timo> look at the "showcased" bit at the top of that notebook file, it has links

[14:35] <timo> looks like you also need Math::DistanceFunctions and more from that list

[14:36] <disbot1> <antononcube> Also, "Graph" can use Graphviz DOT for visualization, which is very robust, working well across different Operating Systems. You just have to install dot , neato, etc.

[14:39] <disbot1> <ng0177> It reminds me of an virtual environment. How do know which packages need to be installed?

[14:40] <disbot1> <antononcube> I am not sure are the packages here relevent for Arch-Linux: https://graphviz.org/download/

[14:40] <disbot1> <antononcube> I found this one too: https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/graphviz/

[14:41] <disbot1> <antononcube> @ng0177 Thanks for the ‚òï !!

[14:44] <disbot1> <ng0177> just installed it and works! Next message is on "Data::Reshapers" should I install via zef "Data" and "Math"?

[14:44] <disbot1> <antononcube> Usually, I take care of the codes in blog posts to have the complete list of packages. But since "Jupyter::Chatbook" pre-loads a lot of packages and can use custom initialization code, sometimes I omit some of packages used.

[14:46] <disbot1> <antononcube> So, you are using the notebook, it seems. Again, in the notebooks I have not included the initialization code. You can run this shell script which is going to install all "data science" packages:

[14:46] <disbot1> <antononcube> https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/scripts/raku-data-science-install.sh

[14:46] <disbot1> <antononcube> A long list of packages, BTW...

[14:47] <disbot1> <antononcube> I should have mentioned that script earlier.

[15:12] <disbot1> <ng0177> https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2024/12/01/graph-neat-examples-in-raku-set-1/ works 90%. How to print the Notebook to pdf to upload here?

[15:17] <disbot1> <antononcube> ü§î

[15:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> Just attach the Jupyter notebook.
