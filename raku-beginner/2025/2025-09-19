[06:25] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> that would be amazing

[06:26] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> although having Raku run on iSH would allow more control

[11:38] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Interesting  Which repo did you use ?

[11:40] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Iâ€™m on iSH 1.3.2 (Build 494)

[11:58] <disbot1> <myrlynx> How do I rename a file?

[12:42] <ab5tract> myrlynx: "new".IO.spurt: "old".IO.slurp

[12:43] <ab5tract> or with :bin if not a text file

[12:43] <ab5tract> I

[12:43] <ab5tract> I'm not sure there is anything more high level than that in core

[12:43] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Thank you!

[12:44] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Did that go through?

[12:45] <ab5tract> I can see your response, if you mean whether your message made it through the irc bridge

[12:46] <ab5tract> myrlynx: I've often thought about what Raku based shell would look like

[12:47] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Raku based shell?

[12:48] <ab5tract> yeah, as opposed to bash/zsh/fish

[12:48] <kjp> mrlynx: There's IO::Path::rename or just the plain rename function.

[12:49] <ab5tract> kjp: ah! I'm glad to be wrong here

[12:49] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Oh. It would be pretty nice. It's kinda messy to use shell scripts so I'm trying to do it in raku

[12:49] <ab5tract> rename is way better than my suggestion

[12:50] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Also how can I search for a file and check if it exists or not?

[12:50] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I'll use rename for it then. The previous one doesn't look too good

[12:53] <disbot1> <myrlynx> thank you kjp

[12:55] <kjp> mrlynx: https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Path#File_test_operators

[12:56] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Ooooo neat! Thank you!

[13:05] <ab5tract> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/path-utils

[13:05] <ab5tract> this is a nice module from lizmat

[13:06] <disbot1> <myrlynx> What's its use case?

[13:06] <ab5tract> just simplifies some conditionals 

[13:07] <lizmat> it was created for App::Rak, and I figured it had more general applicability and thus warranted to be put into a separate module

[13:08] <disbot1> <myrlynx> Does it work on other operating systems?

[13:09] <disbot1> <myrlynx> It says linux mac and windows

[13:18] <disbot1> <myrlynx> How can I take multiple arguements for cli?  e.g. If I have install option and remove option. I want to take one of either options and an arguement after it

[14:33] <ab5tract> multi sub MAIN(:$foo!) { # foo ... }; multi sub MAIN(:$bar!) { # bar ... }

[14:34] <ab5tract> or you can have a single MAIN sub and do the argument processing inline

[14:37] <ab5tract> don't forget about subsets and where clauses :)
