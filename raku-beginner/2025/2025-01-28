[02:11] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> B&R PLC is the PLC (programmable logic controller) from the company Bernecker and Rainer Austria -> they are automation specialists in the lines of Siemens (though Siemens is huge). The PLC can be considered (especially nowadays) to be a small, robust computer running an RTOS running tasks for Automation. In my case, I am trying to talk to the PLC via a Winio Protocol (protocol from B&R) which is based on
