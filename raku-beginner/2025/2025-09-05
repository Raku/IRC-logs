[08:22] <disbot> <simon_sibl> why do I need to "encode" a Str to get its size in bytes ?

[08:23] <disbot> <simon_sibl> since bytes length is encoding independent

[08:32] <crnlskn> as far as I understand, a `Str` doesn't know or care about a specific byte-level representation, and actively changes the internal representation depending on context and operation

[08:33] <crnlskn> that's why you have to ask for a Blob as a specific byte-level representation if you want to concern yourself with bytes

[08:41] <disbot> <simon_sibl> I think thats a good update I just made then, using Buf[uint8] and not caring about encoding, otherwise before it would always convert to utf8

[08:42] <disbot> <simon_sibl> now it is encoding unaware if I can say it that way xD which is better if someone wanna paste utf16 or whatever other encoding

[08:43] <disbot> <simon_sibl> and I get a Blob anyway from the socket supply, so better perf as well
