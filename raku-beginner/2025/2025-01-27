[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> For the curious: what is a „b&r plc server“?

[08:06] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> (I am asking for a friend)

[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Just wondering if a Jupyter-Notbook is an option to display streaming data to users  (in R there is something called shiny) - maybe running local or on a VM …

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> With Jupyter-Hub there is also simple authentication

[08:33] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Maybe this is to „academic“ and does not generate enough follow-up tasks - compared to something fully fledged and compiled

[08:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz I have been trying to evaluate the recent work on Cro and HTNX from that perspective. Full-blown R-Shiny like functionality is a fairly complex undertaking.

[08:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good enough interactive functionality over data graphics can be done via Google Charts— I plan to program that soon.

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, R-Shiny generates JavaScript code from R code. It was inspired by Mathematica’s Manipulate.
