[04:05] <sdomi> trying to print out arbitrary bytes, raku complains `Malformed UTF-8 near bytes 00 86 at line 1 col 3`

[04:05] <sdomi> how do i make it shut up?

[04:09] <sdomi> `.encode('latin1')` mangles my bytes...

[04:20] <sdomi> okay mb, I confused `$*OUT.put` with `$*OUT.write`, i don't need to decode with the 2nd one
