[02:09] <cliviafreak> Does the META6.json file have a schema?

[02:19] *** cliviafreak left
[06:07] <disbot4> <rcmlz> the docs describe how to manage META6.json using „fez“  https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Using_a_dist_manager

[10:10] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @cliviafreak .split(/\s) could be written .words , see: https://docs.raku.org/routine/words

[10:11] <lizmat> that's actually closer to .split(/ \s+ /), but yeah  :)

[10:15] <disbot4> <holmdunc> Do you mean one on https://www.schemastore.org , @cliviafreak?

[10:16] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @lizmat oh, right.

[10:18] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @cliviafreak `` ~% raku -ne 'for .split(/\s/) -> ($a, $b) { say $a, $b };' file Cannot unpack or Capture a. To create a Capture, add parentheses: \(...) If unpacking in a signature, perhaps you needlessly used parentheses? -> ($x) {} vs. -> $x {} or missed :` in signature unpacking? -> &c:(Int) {}   in block <unit> at -e line 1

[17:13] <deoac> I'm having difficulties using %?RESOURCES in a script.  I have resources/ in my directory tree, and "resources" specified in META6.json, but the hash is still empty.

[17:33] <disbot4> <jubilatious1_98524> @deoac I'm not experienced with %?RESOURCES. Can you give more of a description? The Docs say The %?RESOURCES variable is not implemented as a plain Hash...do not expect to see all available resource files in a distribution by printing or by using other ways to inspect its value. Instead, use the API ... ."  https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%25%3FRESOURCES

[21:01] <deoac> >What is the advantage to using %?RESOURCES versus "resources/foo".IO"

[21:01] <disbot4> <antononcube> Portability.

[21:03] <disbot4> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:ab5tract/Resource::Wrangler may be helpful?
