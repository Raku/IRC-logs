[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Out of curiosity I checked for the profiling thing:   https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5238  „The profiler is severely outdated. It seems that there is simply nobody at the moment to take care of it.“

[07:46] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> If I red the issue correcly —profile to html uses „angular.js“ and there are errors in the generated code of sort „missing ) …“  Just as a thought, would a two-step-modular-approach, first exporting the profile-data to e.g. json and then, in a second, independent step visualize it with the current fashionable library not be more sustainable and maintainable?

[07:54] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Meaning that the export to e.g. json is build in into Raku and the visualization comes via a (exchangeable) module. So I am wondering why Rakudo is tied together with angular.js …
