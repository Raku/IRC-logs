[14:23] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> I would be very happy if the Guix package definition would work for the lastest Rakudo version I really need to learn more about packaging  But also about Rakudo, there are compilations and tests error I am unable to understand

[14:26] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> actually I got it to compile, but the file isnt amazing and zef doesnt work xD

[14:27] <disbot8> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/SBOM::Raku may shed some light on BOM matters (plus see lizmat posts in recent weeklies)

[14:27] <disbot8> <librasteve> I use App::Mi6 to curate modules

[14:29] <disbot8> <antononcube> @librasteve Can you expand on that?

[14:30] <disbot8> <antononcube> On "I use App::Mi6 to curate modules"...

[14:30] <disbot8> <librasteve> on the BOM side of things - I have not much of a clue

[14:32] <disbot8> <librasteve> oh - well yes ... App::Mi6 automates setting up new modules with a consistent dir structure, settings for README from rakudoc generation (I always disable that in the dist.ini), change management, release to fez

[14:38] *** arkiuat joined
[14:45] <disbot8> <antononcube> I didn't know about the release feature. I think I used all the others before, but the whole thing seemed too complicated at some point. But I want to re-learn, re-evaluate those workflows. (Of "App::Mi6".)

[14:47] <lizmat> my life maintaining 245 modules + ~200 community modules, would be a *lot* harder without App::Mi6

[15:12] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/pulls/2423

[15:12] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> I created a basic pr, feel free to help xD

[15:18] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> That seems like a lot.. how is it even possible ?

[15:18] <disbot8> <simon_sibl> Is it your job or free contribution ?

[15:49] <arkiuat> lizmat is extremely generous

[15:51] <arkiuat> I for one am very grateful

[16:02] <disbot8> <librasteve> amen

[16:06] <lizmat> it keeps me off the street  :-)

[18:38] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> @abstract I think @antononcube means https://web.mit.edu/~r/current/lib/R/library/base/html/outer.html

[18:40] <disbot8> <antononcube> @jubilatious1_98524 Seriously!! How come you think that?!

[18:41] <disbot8> <antononcube> @jubilatious1_98524 Of course, I was referring to : https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Outer.html

[18:43] <disbot8> <antononcube> I think, in R I have not used outer and  expand.grid for years.

[18:49] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube I took a wild guess---apparently incorrect! I will read your Wolfram reference and be edified. Sincerely.

[18:50] <disbot8> <antononcube> Mathematica's Outer and R's outer are very similar.

[18:53] <disbot8> <antononcube> Raku's X is not exactly the same. But I think cross is close.

[19:01] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> R's outer shows lots of examples with * multiplication cross-products, however FUN cannot call c() to get sublists. R's Vectorize() function seems closer.

[19:01] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> > f <- function(x = 1:3, y) c(x, y) > vf <- Vectorize(f, SIMPLIFY = FALSE) > f(1:3, 1:3) [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 > vf(1:3, 1:3) [[1]] [1] 1 1  [[2]] [1] 2 2  [[3]] [1] 3 3

[19:04] <disbot8> <antononcube> Hm... that is just a zip, right?

[19:06] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> So I was correct when I referred to R's outer() as being the Wolfram equivalent?

[19:08] <disbot8> <antononcube> Very close, but the there some difference. WL's Outer has arguments for separtion depth of the arguments. Also, works on non-lists.

[19:09] <disbot8> <antononcube> For example:  Outer[F, h[a, b], h[x, y, z]] # h[h[F[a, x], F[a, y], F[a, z]], h[F[b, x], F[b, y], F[b, z]]] 

[19:11] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524>  > x <- 1:9; names(x) <- paste(x,":", sep = "") > y <- 1:9; names(y) <- paste(y,":", sep = "") > outer(y, x, "*")    1: 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 1:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 2:  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 3:  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 4:  4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 5:  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 6:  6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 7:  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 8:  8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 9:  9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81

[19:11] <disbot8> >  

[19:14] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> Oh, that's smart. In R you have to build up your paste or c() arguments first. I'll have to play with WL's outer. However I do like R's default 2-d display (see multiplication table above).

[19:23] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> Here's  R's expand.grid() function for comparison:

[19:24] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524>  > x <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 5) > y <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = 3) > d1 <- expand.grid(x = x, y = y) > d1       x  y 1  0.00 -1 2  1.25 -1 3  2.50 -1 4  3.75 -1 5  5.00 -1 6  0.00  0 7  1.25  0 8  2.50  0 9  3.75  0 10 5.00  0 11 0.00  1 12 1.25  1 13 2.50  1 14 3.75  1 15 5.00  1 >

[19:38] <disbot8> <antononcube> This kind of table is not that easy to produce in Raku.

[21:35] <disbot8> <rcmlz> m:  my @x = 1.25, 2.5 ... 5; my @y = -1, 0, 1; .say for @x X @y

[21:36] <disbot8> <rcmlz> you mean the sorting and line numbering?

[21:39] <disbot8> <antononcube> @rcmlz  and @jubilatious1_98524  I am talking about these kind of tables:

[21:39] <disbot8> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1412190107355582484/Screenshot_2025-09-01_at_5.39.03_PM.png?ex=68b76406&is=68b61286&hm=b520bb10cecdd31deaf6a6038329ef3a34e53202cf63ec16e7055f27ca812607&

[21:40] <disbot8> <antononcube> The code in image uses "Data::Reshapers" (to-pretty-table) and "Math::SparseMatrix".

[21:40] <disbot8> <rcmlz> Ah, ok. Was just wondering what you were talking about.

[21:41] <disbot8> <antononcube> Without using packages showing tabular forms like those is not that straightforward.

[21:42] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> Good discussion, thanks.

[21:43] <disbot8> <rcmlz> Yes, you are right. I am also not aware of any build-in sugar regarding table-printing

[21:44] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> I used to use Stargazer in R: https://libguides.princeton.edu/R-stargazer

[21:48] <disbot8> <antononcube> For printing tables?

[21:50] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> Yes. The name stargazer comes from the ability to easily handle p-value "star" notation, within statistical summaries. One-stop shopping in R (to html, latex, etc).

[21:51] <disbot8> <antononcube> That is very R-ish, but otherwise a bad package design.

[21:51] <disbot8> <antononcube> I prefer packages to do "one thing", thematically speaking.

[21:52] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer

[21:52] <disbot8> <antononcube> The corresponding Raku package is "Data::Translators" -- translates different Raku data structures  (say, datasets) to HTML, Python, R, and WL.

[21:53] <disbot8> <antononcube> I have not considered translating to LaTeX, yet. I might add it soon.

[21:54] <disbot8> <jubilatious1_98524> Yeah, R has a lot of this: good packages that do too many things. But part-time programmers like it because they only have one (or a few) tool to remember.
