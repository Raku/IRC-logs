[13:41] <disbot2> <winfredraj> hello all, is there a difference between the usage of a token in grammar, lets say, for example,  <line>? and saying token statement {<line>?} and using <statement> instead of <line>*?

[13:42] <disbot2> <winfredraj> does the greediness change between <line>*? and <statement>, are they essentially the same with different token name?
