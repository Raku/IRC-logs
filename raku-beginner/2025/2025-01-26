[15:40] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> hello all,

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I have a Raku tcp client written for a B&R specific Winio protocol and this works semalessly both in WSL and native Windows - Rakus endless bag of tricks and multiple dispatch helped prototyoe it very quickly

[15:43] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I wanted to finally implement it C# so that I could have a WPF application and I am finding it very difficult to port it to .NET

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Due to time considerations, would it be possible to use the orginal Raku script directly in the .NET application?

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> The other option would be try Gtk and do the frontend in Raku itself, but it would be much simpler for me in WPF

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think there is an easy solution: 1) Make a CLI script for your Raku client, 2) Invoke that script as an "os shell command" from the .NET app.

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Hi, it is continuous data transfer between the Raku client and the B&R PLC server -  I would then either have to log the results in a file and access that for Wpf Or create a Raku server and access that

[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> There will be no way to directly bind the data to the visualization in Wpf
