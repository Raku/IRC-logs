[09:02] <disbot3> <rcmlz> The failing module "Handshake" requires the missing package:: https://github.com/tokuhirom/p6-WebSocket/blob/master/lib/WebSocket/Handshake.pm6

[09:04] <disbot3> <rcmlz> Given the fact that this was touched for the last time 10 years ago perhaps raising an issue on https://github.com/tokuhirom/p6-WebSocket/issues might be am opportunity. Perhaps changing "use Digest::SHA;" to "use Digest::SHA1;" fixes the issue for you locally?

[09:37] <disbot3> <rcmlz> Maybe the author of https://github.com/tokuhirom/p6-WebSocket even has some spare time to setup some GitHub actions (it sounds more complex than it is: https://raku.land/zef:zero-overhead/App::Workflows::Github) to ensure that his package can be installed at all ...

[19:07] <disbot3> <rcmlz> If you want to regularly test if your mot-beloved-modules ( still ) can be installed clone that repo, throw you *.json files into ressources/ folder let github action figure that out for you: https://github.com/rcmlz/Raku-Module-Health-Check
