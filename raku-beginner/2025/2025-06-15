[07:18] <disbot1> <ng0177> Sorry to disrupt continuing a chat from last week: this error is thrown when running the notebook...

[07:28] <disbot1> <antononcube> Hm.. make sure that “JavaScript::Google::Charts” is installed.

[08:00] <disbot1> <ng0177> zef install JavaScript::Google::Charts works!

[08:04] <disbot1> <ng0177> Does an qt6 binding similar to pyside exist for raku and/or is advised?

[08:32] <disbot1> <ng0177> Another question is on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkk_MeqLj_k I am interested in the "Google Charts code assistant section" shown in the video but not available in https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Presentations/Notebooks/Geographics-data-in-Raku-demo-Google-Charts.ipynb Appreciate!

[10:05] <disbot1> <antononcube> That section is there :

[13:17] <disbot1> <antononcube> @ng Can you install VS

[13:18] <disbot1> <antononcube> Alternatively (and better) try installing VS Codium: https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases

[13:21] <disbot1> <antononcube> It has been months since I tried using the Raku-Jupyter kernel in JupyterLab on a generic web browser.

[13:23] <disbot1> <antononcube> It is possible that you might have better luck with standalone/desktop JupyterLab application: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop

[13:39] <thowe> Man, I wish I had time to go through my college stats book.  I enjoyed the class so much I kept the book.

[13:40] <thowe> lizmat, regarding first( :end) - do you know where I can find the docs for :end?

[13:41] <disbot1> <ng0177> I figured out that "/home/th6mas/.raku/bin/" is $PATH for the user but not for root which has it in /etc/profile.d/

[14:04] <disbot1> <ng0177> problem solved! /etc/profile.d/jupyter-chatbook-raku.sh needs to exist, see attached
