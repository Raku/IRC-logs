[17:08] <disbot1> <sailkite> i don't have a strong reason for asking this, but is there a way to use the reduction metaoperator with infix feed operators? i've tried naïve variations and i'm clearly not groking something

[17:09] *** Guest4085 left
[17:21] *** arkiuat joined
[17:27] *** arkiuat left
[17:35] <ab5tract> sailkite: one way to get things working with feeds is to wrap them in a block that calls itself

[17:36] <ab5tract> m: dd do 1..10 ==> { [+] @_ }()

[17:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89dff65d3: OUTPUT: «55␤»

[17:37] <ab5tract> But also in RakuAST you could use a helper class to make it read a bit more nicely

[17:38] <ab5tract> m: Q| my $r = class :: { method reduce(*@a) { [+] @a } }.new; dd do 1..10 ==> reduce($r:)

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89dff65d3: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Couldn't find terminator | (corresponding | was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------>  @a } }.new; dd do 1..10 ==> reduce($r:)<HERE><EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        |␤»

[17:38] <ab5tract> m: Q| my $r = class :: { method reduce(*@a) { [+] @a } }.new; dd do 1..10 ==> reduce($r:) |.AST.EVAL

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89dff65d3: OUTPUT: «55␤»

[17:40] <ab5tract> or less cryptically:

[17:40] <ab5tract> m: Q| class Assist { method reduce(*@a) { [+] @a } }; dd do 1..10 ==> reduce(Assist:) |.AST.EVAL

[17:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 89dff65d3: OUTPUT: «55␤»

[18:05] <disbot1> <sailkite> i guess in an extremely arcane and purely didactic sense, i was wondering about a hypothetical case where there's some concept like this raku my @things = 2, 1, 2; @things     ==> unique()     ==> sort()     ==> say();  and i wanted to somehow manipulate that into a means of using [==>]. i know that it's possible to just simply method chain it @things.unique.sort.say, but i couldn't help but feel curious.

[18:22] <ab5tract> Ah, so that's what you meant :)

[18:23] *** arkiuat joined
[18:24] <ab5tract> I don't think that's possible because there's no way to pass the call in a list (as far as I know, anyway!) 

[18:24] <ab5tract> so even if you could do: [==>] @a, unique(), sort(), say() -- it would fail because you would have the result of those calls in the list instead

[18:26] <ab5tract> but as you've noticed, [==>] and other attempts won't work either because the feed operator is not a higher level Raku infix routine, even though it dresses like one for the party

[18:28] *** arkiuat left
[18:30] <disbot1> <nahita3882> with explicit .reduce there is something, but not that dramatic:

[18:31] <disbot1> <nahita3882> m: my @a = 12, 3, 4, 3; [@a, &unique, &sort, &say].reduce: { &^fun(@^arg) }

[18:31] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  (3 4 12) 

[18:36] <disbot1> <nahita3882> order-preservingness of .unique is appreciated; in CPython, e.g., one does [*dict.fromkeys(arr)] to that effect (PyPy guarantees [*set(arr)] is ok)

[19:59] <habere-et-disper> Is there a simple/portable way to test from raku if the terminal supports non-ASCII? I'm writing to STDOUT and I want to know if it can handle UTF8.
