[10:57] <disbot> <antononcube> Well, the other, regression part of "stargazer" is handled by "Math::Fitting", to  a point. It does not produce fitting "p-value tables", and that is low in my priority list.

[12:16] <icovnik> hello, I have a question about raku module usage

[12:17] <icovnik> I installed Template6 with zef and now I want to change that module

[12:17] <disbot> <librasteve> sure - what's your question

[12:17] <disbot> <librasteve> hi!

[12:17] <disbot> <librasteve> change? how?

[12:17] <icovnik> I found it installed in a directory containing rakudo

[12:18] <icovnik> I changed it - but it didn't run my changes

[12:18] <icovnik> I suspect the module is precompiled or cached somewhere

[12:19] <disbot> <librasteve> zef uninstall Template6 / zef install Template6

[12:19] <icovnik> So my question is: how to remove that installed module from cache, OR how to cache it with my modifications OR how to install it locally and use that instead of "system-wide" module

[12:20] <disbot> <librasteve> find the .precomp subdirectory and delete it

[12:21] <disbot> <librasteve> rakubrew is great for having multiple (local) environements

[12:22] <disbot> <librasteve> rakubrew.org

[12:23] <disbot> <librasteve> otherwise you can tell zef where to put your modules (check out the readme in raku.land)

[12:26] <icovnik> OK, I will try

[12:26] <icovnik> Is there some mechanism like PERL5LIB in raku?

[12:27] <icovnik> and/or setting current path where to find modules inside raku script?

[12:27] <disbot> <librasteve> i often work on module code, when you are in the module root dir, you can run raku -I. script (where the script has use Module;) or specify the include path instead of the .

[12:28] <disbot> <librasteve> oh yeah there''s an ENV for that too

[12:29] <disbot> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/programs/03-environment-variables#Module_loading

[12:29] <disbot> <librasteve> RAKULIB

[12:30] <icovnik> I found .raku/precomp directory and also /path/to/raku/share/perl6/site/precom - which to delete?

[12:30] <icovnik> the .../raku/.../site/precomp seems to be the correct one

[12:30] <icovnik> but what does the ~/.raku directory do?

[12:30] <disbot> <antononcube> @icovnik I assume you know what you doing Raku programming wise. I would suggest the following: (1) Uninstall "Template6" with zef uninstall Template6. (2) Find the code base of "Template6" and Git-clone it. (3) Program your changes. (4) Install the updated package with zef install . --force-install executed in the directory of the Git-clone of "Template6".

[12:31] <disbot> <librasteve> @antononcube - yeah that's what I do (explained better)

[12:31] <disbot> <librasteve> ++

[12:32] <disbot> <librasteve> probably that's the dir where your raku is installed ;-)

[12:32] <icovnik> @antononcube: OK, understand

[12:32] <icovnik> but I really don't know what I am doing Raku-programming-wise :)

[12:33] <disbot> <librasteve> yeah probably not good to mess with the precomps (since that is automated) - the precomps are hashed so that when you make a source change locally (as Aoton says) the change and all the deps are recompiled automatically

[12:34] <disbot> <antononcube> Hmm.. then even more so, use a Git clone.

[12:34] <icovnik> librasteve: well my raku is downloaded as binary tar.gz, extracted in place - and that's it. I set PATH to raku binaries and use it like that. The directory got set somehow automatically, maybe by zef?

[12:35] <disbot> <librasteve> sorry I am not sure how that works exactly...

[12:36] <icovnik> no problem

[12:36] *** arkiuat joined
[12:36] <icovnik> I will try the git-clone version

[12:37] <icovnik> this is only a minor problem, what I want to do is change Template6 a bit (I came from Perl+Template Toolkig) to be more like I expect it to be

[12:38] <disbot> <librasteve> good luck!

[12:38] <icovnik> thanks

[12:38] <disbot> <librasteve> yeah TT is a good thing!

[12:39] <icovnik> true, I use it all the time

[12:39] <icovnik> well one more question

[12:40] <icovnik> how to coerce (is that the right name for this?) a parameter for new object?

[12:40] *** arkiuat left
[12:41] <disbot> <librasteve> can you share some code?

[12:41] <disbot> <antononcube> Filed an issue: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Template6/issues/33

[12:41] <disbot> <librasteve> please

[12:41] <icovnik> I have a class: class Node { has IO::Path $.path; method process {...} };

[12:41] <icovnik> I use it in script and pass the path to it from command line as an argument

[12:42] <disbot> <librasteve> so Node.new( path => 'file'.IO) should work

[12:42] <icovnik> and if I pass it a directory, it gets "/" on the end of the arg

[12:42] <icovnik> yes, that works

[12:43] <icovnik> but what I want - each time I create new Node object, I want it to remove trailing slash

[12:43] <icovnik> I managed to do it inside method new (IO::Path $path) {...}

[12:44] <icovnik> but it doesn't look... right to me

[12:45] *** arkiuat joined
[12:45] <icovnik> I'd like something like "coerce" option in Perl's Moo

[12:46] <disbot> <antononcube> @icovnik It is better if you forget Perl.

[12:46] <disbot> <antononcube> ... when working with Raku.

[12:46] <icovnik> @antononcube that would be quite hard after 20 years of Perl and 3 days of Raku :)

[12:47] <disbot> <antononcube> Raku and Perl are separated by common ideas and cultural baggage.

[12:48] <disbot> <librasteve> class MyNode { has $.file; has $.dir; method new { Node.new( $!dir.subst( //$/, '') ... maybe (dunno)

[12:49] <crnlskn> feels vaguely like an XY problem to me; why is important that the IO attribute itself does not contain the trailing slash?

[12:50] <disbot> <antononcube> @icovnik Ok. At least read https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell , but I am not sure it covers OOP.

[12:51] <disbot> <antononcube> Mm... not just the "nutshell" guide. Here are all of them: https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-overview

[12:54] *** arkiuat left
[12:54] <disbot> <antononcube> @librasteve Do you use TT (Template Toolkit) ?

[12:59] <disbot> <librasteve> used to back in the day - I just like the way the syntax flows - I have done a bit of crotmp recently (which is a lovely new syntax from jnthn) that feels very perl/raku natural

[13:00] <disbot> <librasteve> of course, at heart I am allergic to templates and like to write Air::Functional html

[13:00] <disbot> <librasteve> https://harcstack.org/ shows that a bit

[13:27] <icovnik> sorry, real life attacked me right now

[13:27] *** arkiuat left
[13:27] <icovnik> the trailing slash is important (I think) because I use it next to create sub-directory paths and use that in web

[13:29] <icovnik> and I don't want paths like /dir1/dir2//file.html (note the double slash)

[13:31] <icovnik> now after studying docs for IO::Path I know there is something like "some/path".IO.add("subdir") but currently all of this didn't "click" in my head

[13:32] <icovnik> so I feel like some lumberjack in china shop

[13:32] <icovnik> so much to learn

[13:34] <icovnik> OK, thank you all, you have given me some information to process

[13:56] <icovnik> heh I need more help, really basic

[13:56] <icovnik> I encountered this: ".return with %!data{$query};"

[13:56] <icovnik> how to get info about "with"?

[13:57] <icovnik> e.g. don't want the info about "with", but how to get that info by myself?

[13:57] <icovnik> I tried to search on https://docs.raku.org/ but "with" is too broad search term

[14:04] <crnlskn> it's the 8th item under the "composite" heading in the search results for me

[14:04] *** arkiuat left
[14:04] <crnlskn> the list being scrollable is a bit non-obvious

[14:05] *** arkiuat joined
[14:07] <icovnik> oh, I saw that but it didn't seem to be what I was looking for

[14:07] <icovnik> oh, I saw that but it didn't seem to be what I was looking for

[14:10] *** arkiuat left
[14:10] <crnlskn> it should be; `with orwith without` in language/control is exactly where those keywords are explained :)

[14:11] <icovnik> yes, I found it, thak you

[14:12] <icovnik> ...thank you of course

[14:52] <disbot> <antononcube> @icovnik Use LLMs -- later models know Raku very well.

[15:06] <disbot> <librasteve> I share your thoughts about the searchbox on docs.raku.org - a new version of the dos site is underway - please raise an issue here https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues to share your concern with the team

[15:09] <disbot> <librasteve> my worry is that since raku has many very english words as operators - my, our, has, with and so on that any good search will need to be designed for raku. We really need some careful hand curation of the searchbox results that recognizes and priorotizes these. Anyway, please share back the link to your new issue here and we can all add our thoughts
