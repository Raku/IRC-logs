[11:26] <ab5tract> I don’t think embedding side effects into where clauses is a very good idea

[11:26] <ab5tract> Though sometimes it needs to be done

[11:28] <ab5tract> However, here the issue is the precedence level of ‘or’

[11:28] <ab5tract> m: subset Even where { $_ %% 2 || warn "that's odd" };  my Even $n = 13;

[11:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «that's odd␤  in block  at <tmp> line 1␤Type check failed in assignment to $n; expected Even but got Int (13)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:29] <ab5tract> m: subset Even where { $_ %% 2 || do { warn "that's odd"; 1 }};  my Even $n = 13;

[11:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e9f25272: OUTPUT: «that's odd␤  in block  at <tmp> line 1␤»

[11:29] <ab5tract> You can do all sorts of funky stuff with where clauses
