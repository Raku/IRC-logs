[13:49] <msiism> Is there a shorter way to get the index number of the last character in a string than `chars($word) - 1`?

[14:14] <disbot3> <nahita3882> if strings were iterable, .end would be it but it gives the wrong answer

[14:14] <disbot3> <nahita3882> so, no most probably

[14:14] <disbot3> <nahita3882> method form with .chars saves 1 character :y

[14:16] <disbot3> <nahita3882> a longer, bad way is $word.match(/$/).pos.pred

[14:16] <disbot3> <nahita3882> lastly, one might need to be careful for empty strings

[14:30] <msiism> Looking at it again, the `chars($word) - 1` is actually pretty concise.

[14:31] <msiism> What I would really like to have is a way to obtain a letter from a certain index, without having to use substr.

[14:32] <msiism> Something like `getchar($string, $index)`.

[14:59] <msiism> I mean character, of course, not letter. Just currently woking only with letters here…

[15:01] <disbot3> <librasteve> msiiam: once you embrace unicode as graphemes, then the idea of a character independent of the bytes before and after it no longer holds

[21:37] <msiism> To break an unconditional loop, do I simply use return?

[21:39] <msiism> Uhh… no, I don't, because return is for returning from routines.

[21:39] <msiism> Seem like there's no break statement in Raku.

[21:43] <msiism> Okay, thanks.
