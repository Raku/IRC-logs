[06:32] <disbot3> <rcmlz> It is back from the time when I started using Raku and Github actions. The vision was to simply test install-ability of ALL (of my) modules on raku.land regularly. I realized that requirements (e,g, module X needs stuff like gnuplot and module Y some special libs from package Z you have to install using your distribution specific beforehand) make the  BIG vision impractical.  These days I tackle „reproduceability“ with

[06:32] <disbot3> Nix.

[09:21] <ds7832> I also started learning Nix(OS) a couple of weeks ago, although I'm now seriously reconsidering that choice because of the diretion in which the Nix project is going. Perhaps pivoting to Guix instead.

[13:07] <disbot3> <_elcaro_> Problem solving links are reversed (first and third links have titles swapped (or links swapped))

[13:12] <disbot3> <antononcube> @Alexanda I am sorry, I cannot help on this. I am not using Linux regularly, and I cannot find "Digest::SHA" anywhere.

[14:21] <disbot3> <neekotism> No worries! I think it might've worked after doing this https://discord.com/channels/538407879980482560/768511641758466088/1424321445416140810

[15:12] <disbot3> <rcmlz> If it worked locally, perhaps the author will appreciate a PR

[15:25] <disbot3> <neekotism> I see. I'll check how it works
