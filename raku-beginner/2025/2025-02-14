[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> habere-et-disper: did you try to create a nix file (package) that sets up rakudo, zef and packages - like rakudo-star does outside of nix? Or did you try to use rakudo-star from nix?

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> do you have the file you are working on (default.nix, shell.nix, …) on some public space?

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Nix and the underlying concepts are not easy to grasp - but addictive. I also fiddle around with NixOS/Nix-Packages on beginners level, perhaps I can have a look.

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> today i learned that Raku has a (kind of) built-in identity function: [o] or [∘]

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> can we catch the "potential difficulties" things? is that an error or a warning or something else?

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> for example: say 02;

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That is interesting -- I would occasionally "miss" having an identity function in Raku.

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> I think that’s compile time so probably not

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> hmm, so I can CATCH some (all?) compile-time errors under, say, .EVAL, but this is like a compile-time warning and there is no mechanism for that?

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> m: CATCH { default { say $_.is-compile-time } }; "&unknown()".EVAL

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Undeclared routine:     unknown used at line 1  

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> m: CATCH { default { say $_.is-compile-time } }; Q|&unknown()|.EVAL

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  1 

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> m: CATCH { default { say $_.is-compile-time } }; Q|02|.EVAL

[17:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Potential difficulties:     Leading 0 has no meaning.  If you meant to create an octal number, use     '0o' prefix; like, '0o2'.  If you meant to create a string, please add     quotation marks.     at /home/glot/EVAL_0:1     ------> 02⏏<EOL> 

[19:27] <ab5tract> nahita3882: I think this works?

[19:27] <ab5tract> m: BEGIN CATCH { say "caught $_" }; my Int $x = "ok"

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar f85560449: OUTPUT: «caught Type check failed in assignment to $x; expected Int but got Str ("ok")␤Type check failed in assignment to $x; expected Int but got Str ("ok")␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:27] <ab5tract> but make sure you keep it as a thunk, or else the CATCH is installed underneath the scope you actually intended

[19:30] <ab5tract> Sorry, disregard that as these are not addressing compile time
