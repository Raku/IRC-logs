[03:42] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> not quite sure to understand this Precedence issue with ! and :exists, perhaps you meant :!exists?, I understand the !exists but what about the ? at the end ? its like so but at the end ?

[03:43] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> actually the ? isnt part of the syntax but of the sentence, my bad 😆

[14:46] <disbot1> <antononcube> What is the most elegant way to swap the values of two hashmap variables? This does not work: (%h1, %h2) = (%h2, %h1).

[14:49] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> @antononcube does cas help? https://docs.raku.org/routine/cas

[14:49] <disbot1> <librasteve> probably not (that's calling a specific assmebler instruction)

[14:51] <disbot1> <antononcube> Yeah, I was hoping that there is a swap operator or, say.  (%h1, %h2) .= reverse might work.

[14:51] <disbot1> <antononcube> Didn't know about cas...

[14:52] <librasteve_> m: my $h1 = {:a(0), :b(1)}; my $h2 = {:c(2), :d(3)}; ($h1, $h2) = ($h2, $h1); say $h1; say $h2;

[14:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1b3f9277: OUTPUT: «{c => 2, d => 3}␤{a => 0, b => 1}␤»

[14:53] <librasteve_> I think your top idea works if the Hash s are in Scalar containers

[14:54] <librasteve_> would be better if there’s a clean way to itemize / deitemize (which there probably is, but I have to research it)

[14:55] <librasteve_> likely best approach it to use a Capture … so sub may be your friend

[14:58] <disbot1> <antononcube> Yeah, I figured it works with $ sigiled variables. But I plan to use the swap over class members that already have % sigil.

[14:59] <disbot1> <nahita3882> what about :(%h, %g) := (%g, %h);

[15:01] <disbot1> <nahita3882> signature literal on the left hand side

[15:03] <disbot1> <librasteve> @nahita3882 you are a star!

[15:09] <disbot1> <antononcube> @nahita3882 Thank works! Thanks.

[15:38] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Yeah, assignment is a little weird (for me sometimes unintuitive) when it comes to multiple assignment

[15:39] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Binding does what I would expect more, but it comes with some other consequences in terms of mutability which sometimes I don’t want

[15:40] *** meadow joined
[15:43] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Basically assignment treats anything @ or % sigiled on the left hand side as slurpy which makes my @a = 1, 2; DWIM but not so much my (@a, @b) = (1, 2), (3, 4);

[15:44] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> @a just slurps the whole LoL

[15:46] *** human-blip left
[15:46] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Switch to binding and it DWIMs but then you can’t reassign either variable later

[15:47] *** human-blip joined
[15:48] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> Oh, you’re using a signature to get around that - that’s really nice

[15:50] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> ah but that's only going to work when both are declared prior

[15:50] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> or does it? No, it does work, wow

[15:51] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> m: my :(@a, @b) := (1, 2), (3, 4); say "a: @a[] / b: @b[]";

[15:51] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  a: 1 2 / b: 3 4 

[15:52] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> oh but you do still have the immutability problem

[15:52] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> m: my :(@a, @b) := (1, 2), (3, 4); @a = 5, 6;

[15:52] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Cannot modify an immutable Int (1)   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[15:52] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> the error message being... rather interesting

[16:27] <arkiuat> I was thinking about doing it the old-fashioned way, with a temp hash variable, and only then did it occur to me that swapping two entire hashes is an unusual thing to do

[16:36] <disbot1> <.landyacht.> I would quite like some way to specify slurpiness when doing assignment, similar to how it works in signatures, though I know changing the default behavior now would probably destroy a lot of code…

[17:49] *** meadow left
[17:53] <ab5tract> The current error message does suggest using bind instead of assignment

[17:54] <ab5tract> m: my :(*@a) = [1,2],[6,7]
