[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> hi, what does "week 7 of hopefully only 209" mean in the Weekly news at the end?

[19:36] *** jgaz left
[19:42] <[Coke]> m: 209/4

[19:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar c1eead877: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "/" in expression "209/4" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[19:42] <[Coke]> m: say 209/4

[19:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar c1eead877: OUTPUT: «52.25␤»

[19:42] <[Coke]> Guessing it's something that started 7 weeks ago and might end in about 4 years.

[19:48] <[Coke]> m: say now.Date - 7*7

[19:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar c1eead877: OUTPUT: «2025-01-20␤»

[19:49] <[Coke]> m: say 209*7/365.24

[19:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar c1eead877: OUTPUT: «4.005585␤»

[19:50] <lizmat> so what did start 7 weeks ago, and hopefully ends in 4 years ?

[19:51] <[Coke]> oh, I have a very good guess myself. :)

[19:51] <[Coke]> I didn't want to "do the homework", as it were.

[20:36] <lizmat> [Coke]: understood  :-)
