[20:39] <disbot1> <lucminax> Hello! I'm very new to Raku but already kinda falling in love with it, so I decided to join here to gather more resources for learning. I'm currently going through https://course.raku.org/ and would like to know what others here recommend. Thank you in advance!

[21:22] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Hello @lucminax I did most of the exercises here: https://exercism.org/tracks/raku advantage for me: I was able to learn from awesome solutions of other Rakoons - when comparing them to my poor approaches.

[21:26] <ab5tract> Welcome lucminax! Rosetta Code is an oldie but goodie for comparative examples

[21:39] <disbot1> <librasteve> welcome! i like https://raku.guide ... sounds like you already have that down ... next level to cover are the OO reference in the docs imo, then maybe Grammar and Regex if that is your interest
