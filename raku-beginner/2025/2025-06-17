[12:19] <soverysour> hello, does anyone know what's the idiomatic way for removing newlines (and other whitespaces) from a raku (.WHAT) Str? Can't seem to be able to remove anything using $the-string ~~ s/\s//;

[12:45] <thundergnat> soverysour there are a few way to do it.

[12:45] <thundergnat> m: say "does anyone know what's the idiomatic way for removing newlines (and other whitespaces)".trans(/\s/ => '')

[13:52] <thundergnat> Like I said, a few ways to do it. Which is best will likely depend on your specific use case.
