[01:56] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I don't understand this

[03:02] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> Basically the arguments you give to MAIN, will become your cli arguments

[03:03] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> And you can use multi sub, to have different way of handling them

[03:04] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> In this case you can only have either foo or bar but not both

[03:04] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> I would usually go for this

[03:06] <disbot1> <simon_sibl> The ! At the end of the variable name means its a mandatory argument

[21:59] <habere-et-disper> On nixos, how do I get `zef install IO::Socket::SSL` to install as I get:

[21:59] <habere-et-disper> [OpenSSL] Cannot locate native library 'libssl.so'

[22:25] *** habere-et-disper left

[23:44] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I got that too

[23:45] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I just used zef install --/test IO::Socket::SSL

[23:46] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I think I got it working from installing from source
