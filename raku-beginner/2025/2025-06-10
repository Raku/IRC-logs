[05:09] <disbot1> <rcmlz> @ng0177 would you be interested in trying an „reproduceability“ setup approach using Nix?

[16:41] <disbot1> <ng0177> Appreciate the offer, to be honest: not now. Thanks.

[16:49] <disbot1> <ng0177> Sorry for the late reply: I double checked and found no other error than the JavaScript::D3" error you mentioned above.

[16:50] <disbot1> <ng0177> If you do not mind, please let me have some hints on how to use  (i) "JavaScript::Google::Charts" or (ii) VS Code. Thanks.

[18:38] <disbot1> <antononcube> There is a movie, or two, about VS Code and “JavaScript::Google::Charts”.

[21:27] <thowe> I can't seem to figure out the documentation for "first" to search an array.  I have an array of hashes, and I want to be able to search the array and find the first element that has a particular hash value.  something like @myarray.first($_{'key} == value)  and get an array index of that value.

[21:38] <thowe> , Oh, I needed brackets...

[21:43] <ab5tract> m: my @a = <a b c>; dd @a.pairs.first(*.value eq 'c').key

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3a86fd2d2: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[21:43] <ab5tract> thowe: ^^

[21:45] <thowe> i did @a.first({$_{'key' == $value}, :k);  Is that a less good way to do it?

[21:45] <thowe> missed a bracket in the above, but I think you see

[21:55] <ab5tract> ah, now that's fine too

[21:55] <ab5tract> *no
