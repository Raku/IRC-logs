[17:54] <disbot6> <librasteve> o/ ... I just would like to welcome all participants in the raku-beginner (which btw is the most advanced set of beginners I ever saw) to make a post on the raku-advent.blog --- in many subjects ... "how raku compares to language X", "what are the trickiest parts to learning raku",  you are probably the best placed to write something objective and accurate - please go hear to reserve your slot
