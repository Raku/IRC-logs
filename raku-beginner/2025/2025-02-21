[09:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> msiism: fwiw there are usually many ways to solve a problem in raku (which is fine) ... but I think that if you saw // in the wild (eg when maintaining other's code) then it would be a shortfall in the course not to have at least shown you that perl/raku idiom

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> msiism: as opposed to eg Python where there are also multiple ways to solve a problem - but that is frowned upon ;-)

[09:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> msiism: nevertheless feedback is welcome - good and not so good - thanks!

[12:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @msiism ⚠️ Raku is a very user friendly language. It is just very selective about its friends.

[12:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This might help going through Raku exercises and their solutions by whoever created them.
