[22:03] <disbot1> <bobby_jim_birdrock> I'm doing something really really stupid and I can't see it.   It's driving me nuts.  I'm working on a Raku grammar and running into a baffling parse failure. I’ve got a minimal grammar that should match the trivial little string message:UINT8;, and it doesn’t—but everything looks correct. Here's the "full" grammar and the call to .parse(). Anyone seen something like this?  grammar Xenober16::Parser2 {  

[22:03] <disbot1>   token ws { \s* }     rule TOP {         <identifier> <colon> <data-type> <semicolon>     }     token identifier { <[a..zA..Z_]>+ }     token data-type { 'UINT8'i }     token colon { ':' }     token semicolon { ';' } }    use lib './lib';  use Xenober16::Parser2;   say Xenober16::Parser2.parse("message:STRING;");       (The result is Nil)

[22:55] <disbot1> <nahita3882> i'm not good with Grammars but you have 'UINT8'i -- what's the trailing i doing there

[22:56] <disbot1> <nahita3882> as it stands, it is as if you wrote 'UINT8i'

[22:56] <disbot1> <nahita3882> did you mean to use case insensitive adverb like :i?

[23:51] <disbot1> <bobby_jim_birdrock> I think you're right; thank you
