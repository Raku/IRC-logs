[10:00] <Manifest0> hi! I'm trying to upload my little utility to raku.land website. I'm using fez: https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/b341ee7258c5

[10:01] <Manifest0> however i'm getting email saying "Error reading META from your last upload"

[10:01] <Manifest0> There's no other information. i checked and the META6.json is a valid json. How do i know what's wrong with it?

[13:17] <ab5tract> Hi Manifest0 o/

[13:17] <ab5tract> have you tried running `fez review` prior to upload?

[13:49] <Manifest0> ab5tract: yes. It says resources OK

[13:49] <ab5tract> hmm..

[13:50] <ab5tract> And fez is the latet version?

[13:51] <ab5tract> I'm wondering if `fez meta` might provide at least an actionable detail, as well

[13:52] <Manifest0> i installed fez yesterday, so i believe it's the latest one

[13:54] <Manifest0> Just tried again. Got: >>= Hey! You did it! Your dist will be indexed shortly.

[13:55] <Manifest0> but got again the email with error

[13:56] <ab5tract> hmm, well let's see which one is true :D

[13:59] <Manifest0> it would be nice to have more info in the email.

[14:17] <ab5tract> Might be worth creating a ticket for that

[14:17] <Manifest0> Which project? Fez?

[14:17] <ab5tract> yeah

[14:19] <ab5tract> or ping tony-o :)

[14:41] <ab5tract> er, tonyo (do I always just imagine a dash in there?)

[16:08] <disbot3> <rikashore> when depending on libraries/modules, does the installation always lead to a global install, or is there a way to locally install dependencies to a raku project?

[16:25] <disbot3> <librasteve> @rika - hello

[16:26] <disbot3> <librasteve> the rakubrew.org tool is like pyenv - easy to have multiple switchable versions

[16:28] <disbot3> <librasteve> with the zef package manager you have

[16:28] <disbot3> <librasteve>  # Install to a custom locations --install-to=<id> # site/home/vendor/perl, or -to=<id>          # inst#/home/some/path/custom 

[16:28] <disbot3> <librasteve> https://raku.land/github:ugexe/zef

[16:30] <disbot3> <librasteve> btw the default ofr both zef and rakubrew is to install in the user local folders ... so you have to explicitly setup shared dirs if you want a systemwide install

[17:00] <tonyo> it is most likely you have v55 installed, with the current `main` you will get feedback immediately.  Manifest0 are you able to email me the file it is uploading (send me a pm)? if you are good with git then i can send you instructions on how to install fez from latest main and maybe those errors will be a little more helpful (or avoid whatever bug the lambdas have)

[18:26] <habere-et-disper> is it intentional that...

[18:27] <habere-et-disper> m: say so ' ' + 1 == 1

[18:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a1f70139: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[18:27] <habere-et-disper> while...

[18:27] <habere-et-disper> m: say so ' '.succ == 1

[18:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a1f70139: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[18:29] <habere-et-disper> it seems they should both operate in numeric context, yet we get different results in these two cases

[18:33] <disbot3> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: what is the intention of ''.succ ... is that to make the successor to a '' Str?

[18:35] <habere-et-disper> according to the docs, i think it means the same as `.Numeric.succ` in which case i thought they may be required to be consistent ?

[18:35] <habere-et-disper> https://docs.raku.org/routine/succ

[18:37] <habere-et-disper> i think i'm reading the docs wrong. that was for the allmorph case.

[18:37] <disbot3> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/routine/succ#(Str)_method_succ says Returns the string incremented by one. so I wonder what you think the right result is when you increment '' by one?

[18:37] <disbot3> <librasteve> (hint: it's gonna be a Str)

[18:39] <habere-et-disper> space doesn't fall into a natural range and so is not being incremented i guess

[18:41] <habere-et-disper> it seems the same holds true for a lot of ascii characters that don't have an obvious range, eg...

[18:41] <habere-et-disper> m: say ('@'.succ).raku

[18:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a1f70139: OUTPUT: ¬´"\@"‚ê§¬ª

[18:42] <disbot3> <librasteve> The actual increment step works by mapping the last alphanumeric character to a character range it belongs to, and choosing the next character in that range, carrying to the previous letter on overflow.

[18:43] <disbot3> <librasteve> m: say 'Œ±'.succ

[18:43] <disbot3> <Raku eval>  Œ≤ 

[18:44] <disbot3> <librasteve> oh - I read '' as Str with no chars, same outcome I guess

[18:47] <disbot3> <librasteve> m: say ' '.encode

[18:47] <disbot3> <Raku eval>  utf8:0x<20> 

[18:47] <disbot3> <librasteve> m: say ' '.succ.encode

[18:47] <disbot3> <Raku eval>  utf8:0x<20> 

[18:47] <disbot3> <librasteve> same

[18:48] <disbot3> <librasteve> guess that if no applicable sequence is found then just get the original Str unchanged

[18:49] <habere-et-disper> =b

[18:49] <disbot3> <librasteve> huh?

[18:51] <disbot3> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: so now I wonder what you think ' ' == 1 does

[18:52] <habere-et-disper> thumbs up / üëç / =b

[18:53] <disbot3> <librasteve> lol

[18:54] <disbot3> <librasteve> that's why I hang out here ... to learn stuff
