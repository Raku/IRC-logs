[19:12] <korvo> Hi! I'm trying out Raku in stead of META II for a toy compiler. The grammar feature works wonderfully, and I started with inline action blocks in the grammar; but I've tried to factor out those blocks into a separate class of actions and it's no longer working.

[19:13] <korvo> Code is at https://bpa.st/VPPA . I suspect that I've gotten the syntax of the .parse() call wrong somehow. What did I do wrong, please?

[19:14] <korvo> In case anybody needs it, an example input which parses properly that I'm using for testing: [:obj|^(self clone: self allocator*) assign: "obj*" ref: obj]

[19:18] <korvo> ...Oh, and I realize that I don't have a reputation here yet, so: I'm not using any LLMs or other generative modeling tools. I'm merely trying to compile a little expression language because my angle of repose has slightly increased, and multiple folks have recommended Raku for parsing and lightweight compilers.

[19:33] <korvo> The Rubber Duck effect strikes again. I was missing parens, so that $:actions were being passed to slurp instead of .parse(). Humbling.

[19:37] <korvo> Well, thanks for listening. Also thanks for a worthy successor to META II. This is the first enjoyable parser toolkit I've used in a while; I spent almost no time fussing over the Regex tools, found it easy to refactor productions, and am spending most of my time trying to handle strings and lists and I/O.

[19:58] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @korvo congrats on your Raku journey and glad to hear you are making progress. Can I ask you a little about your Vixen Grammar? Does <[A..Za..z*]>+ accept * star as a character? I'm surprised it doesn't need to be escaped. Thx.

[20:00] <korvo> jubilatious1: Yeah! I was mildly surprised that that didn't need to be escaped, but I suppose that <[ is already a pretty strong delimiter. The asterisk convention is inherited from an old language called Self.

[21:15] <disbot6> <jubilatious1_98524> @korvo: Interesting. I guess you don't use <alpha> because it includes _ underscore.

[21:18] <korvo> I didn't really think about it much. I used the minimal character class that works for what I've already built, and I'll probably expand it further. The main character to exclude is : COLON which indicates whether an identifier is bareword or selector. (This is all in the tradition of Smalltalk, if you'd like further reading.)
