[05:10] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Thank you. „>>“ is something I need to use more often.  SmokeMachine: interesting solution. I do not understand yet, why the order is preserved …

[06:55] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> antipairs makes each line into a key/value with line-number as value.  The final sort reconstructs the input order (head insures that only the first value per key is used for sorting). Clever.

[07:05] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> Hi, I don't uunderstand what "line 20" refers to. Could you explain? Thx.

[07:05] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> FYI, I tried to write awk-like Raku, so people reading the accepted answer (15 Upvotes) would see parallels. Cheers. https://stackoverflow.com/a/77964930/7270649

[10:27] <disbot1> <rcmlz> With line 20 I was refering to the glot.io link. My final version, taking also memory into account is   # read all lines from standard input - we need it twice, hence we store it in an array my @numbers = $*IN.lines;  # find numbers that appear only once my %singletons = @numbers.Bag.grep(*.value == 1);  # print the single-occurrence numbers in their original order @numbers.grep( -> $n { %singletons{ $n }:exists }

[14:22] <disbot1> <_elcaro_> You could also do that this way perl @numbers.Bag.grep(*.value == 1).Hash{@numbers}:k  I always try to remember when doing something like @xs.map({ %h{$_} }) that I can often just do %h{@xs}

[15:02] <disbot1> <rcmlz> Oh, that is better! Will include that in my really-final-version. Thank you for the hint.

[17:16] <disbot1> <librasteve> @myrlynx depending on your platform, you may need some developer libraries installed for the SHA1 to work...

[17:22] <disbot1> <myrlynx> I think I got it working from installing from source

[18:24] <disbot1> <antononcube> I have to always do that on macOS.

[19:43] <disbot1> <librasteve> recently I have tested a clean new user on macos against the proposed install methods listing on the new raku.org site - so homebrew and rakubrew have been successful for me - also @arkuiat asked me to add MacPorts today (and I trust that he would only do that if it works reasonably well with a reasonably recent version installed)

[19:43] <disbot1> <librasteve> please do highlight to me any issues with any install method listed on the new raku.org and I will try to adjust the defaults
