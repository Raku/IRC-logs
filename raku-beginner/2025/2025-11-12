[22:41] <habere-et-disper> How do I go back to the beginning of the same line (linefeed) so that following output will overwrite what was just output?

[22:42] <habere-et-disper> m: print "TEST\c[LINE FEED]OVERWRITE"

[22:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «TEST␤OVERWRITE»

[22:45] <habere-et-disper> Got it -- carriage return.

[22:46] <habere-et-disper> m: print "00\c[carriage return]99"

[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7106759ed: OUTPUT: «00
