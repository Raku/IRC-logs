[01:00] <discord-raku-bot> <everynametaken> So complete beginner, tried running a small program with  raku --profile=name.html just for fun. It produced an html file, but when opened with a browser (on Windows 11) it doesn't show any variables loading in. Anything I can do to fix this?

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @everynametaken when I tried this on quite a large program it took a while (on my M1 mac) to populate the variable fields (several mins). You may want to try on a tiny program with no library imports first to check if this is just a matter of time.

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <everynametaken> This was with a tiny program

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <everynametaken> Tried it with $_.say for (1...99) and got the same result

[16:52] <lizmat> then it haz a bug  :-(   --profile has been lacking TLC for a time already  :-(

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <everynametaken> Guess I'll need to reinstall (and try an older version)

[17:01] <lizmat> everynametaken what are you trying to achieve ?

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <everynametaken> I honestly just wanted to try profiling a Raku program I made for fun (back in advent of code). Guess I don’t “need” to do so, just wanted to out of curiosity.

[18:18] <lizmat> well, if it's an itch you want to scratch..  :-)   you're welcome to try and fix the issue!

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @everynametaken Alternatively, find some other itches you do not need to have a scratch them (with Raku.) And report any in interesting results.

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Boring results are fine, too.
