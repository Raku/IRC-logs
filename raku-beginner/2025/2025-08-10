[11:50] <disbot4> <librasteve> thowe: you may want to take a look at the Contact module … https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Contact which is an initial stab at name and address parsing … probably your solution is already more powerful than the current Contact (since you have tested on 3k real data) … would you be happy to help improve Contact. if so please review the source and let me know if you are OK to make a PR  .., I am happy to help if

[11:50] <disbot4> needed … so if that sounds too hard, maybe you can share your working code and some test examples via an issue on that repo?
