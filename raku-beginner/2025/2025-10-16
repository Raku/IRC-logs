[09:34] <ab5tract> rcmlz: tapping is totally fine, but you can also use this as an opportunity to explore react, eg `react { whenever $supply -> $item { ... } }`

[12:06] <disbot9> <rcmlz> Yes, good idea. There should be something "better" than "loop + wait".

[15:33] <disbot9> <rcmlz> I got stuck - same as the original author - when reading/writing to the names pipes.  "watch-path" and "react { whenever ..." work.  when I just touch the input, then it gets detected, but as soon as I "cat" some strings into the ips-files, all freezes.
