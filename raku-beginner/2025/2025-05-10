[03:24] <lucs> Given $u = '0042', how do I interpolate $u in a string to have it print as 'B'?

[03:24] <lucs> (Note that U+0042 is B.)

[03:35] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> one way would be something like `my $n = $u.parse-base(16); say $n.chr'

[03:36] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> as in, "0020" is base 10 (or base 8 if you're an old head), so you first gotta get it as hex

[03:37] <discord-raku-bot> <coranila> in a string that's probably "{$x.parse-base(16).chr}"

[03:38] <lucs> Yep, that does it.

[03:38] <lucs> Thanks.
