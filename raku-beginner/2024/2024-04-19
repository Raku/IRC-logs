[04:44] <greenfork> @antononcube I was actually referring to the repl command, since it effectively solves the problem of inspecting file contents after the file was run

[04:44] <greenfork> But since you asked, here is an example that works for me: https://paste.sr.ht/~greenfork/4cecd40746ded1c7f74db74ee4a6b0ae6b07664e

[04:45] <greenfork> You will need to change the path to the file, and after running the imported.raku, you will see two messages printed, first from exported and second on use

[04:46] <greenfork> s/imported/importing/

[10:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @greenfork Great! It is how ugexe adviced. What if the file name has white spaces?

[12:10] <greenfork> @antononcube I have just put a space there, it worked: require WHATEVER:file</home/grfork/for export.raku>

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I find that surprizing! ðŸ™‚

[16:17] <greenfork> Well I guess it's good as long as it works :^)
