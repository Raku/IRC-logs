[10:51] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Hello all, is there a way make a dll using rakulang and call it with other languages

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Grammars have me hooked here, it is not easy to do what we do with grammars elsewhere

[11:01] <lizmat> not at the current time, afaik

[11:08] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Ok thanks Lizmat, will that be a possibility if the old Gsoc project of self contained executables is completed? Or will that not be related?

[11:08] <lizmat> that's exactly the project that needs to be completed

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Thanks

[11:09] <lizmat> at the moment, the RakuAST effort has a higher prio

[11:09] <lizmat> unless there's someone carrying on with the GSOC project

[11:10] <lizmat> they will get all the help they need, I'm sure

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj "Grammars have me hooked here, it is not easy to do what we do with grammars elsewhere" -- OOP grammars is why I moved to Raku.

[13:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj Consider making a web service for your grammar functionalities. You can run it locally (on your computer), rent a server and run it on that server, and/or have a Docker image.

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> winfredraj: have you considered making a raku cli command (eg like App::Rak has rak and then wrapping to an SO like this https://www.perplexity.ai/search/make-a-cli-command-into-an-so-TEPkeM6YQ_KKO3MoKwAhoA#0

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (obviously would need to adjust if you want a dll instead of an SO)

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Did you submit any of your Raky-Docker containers to Docker Hub?

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve Ah -- here is one: https://hub.docker.com/r/librasteve/rakudo
