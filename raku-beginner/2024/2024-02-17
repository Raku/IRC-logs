[05:06] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Does anyone have an example Cro application using Red that I can take a look at?

[15:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I never succeeded to install "Red" on my macOS computer.

[16:09] <SmokeMachine> Can you install DB::Pg or is it a different problem?

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <kawaii.vx> https://github.com/kawaii/raku-ffxiv-pfapi/blob/master/pfapi.raku

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <kawaii.vx> it's not very complicated

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <kawaii.vx> just a few routes and simple models

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @SmokeMachine Yeah -- I had problems installing the Database packages. Will try that again today.

[17:09] <SmokeMachine> If you are not going to use Pg, it’s just the case of installing with —force.
