[17:28] <renormalist> in context of grammars, just to make sure: regex/token/rule only *behave* differently (like token doesn't backtrack), but all can contain the full syntax of complex regexes/tokens/rules, right?

[17:35] <renormalist> What nags my brain is the impact of such a behaviour in the overall picture. Like a token 'dummy' which does not backtrack but contains "foo"|"bar" as part of another 'regex' and partially succeeds with "foo", will that *regex* backtrack and potentially try the token 'dummy' with "bar"?

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my freind ChatGPT says this https://chatgpt.com/share/673e1fe7-2354-8009-ac4f-978ce6654164 (which is a lot better answer than I can do ... but it may be hallucinating)

[17:51] <renormalist> librasteve_: if this sentence is true: "token:

[17:52] <renormalist> "Does not backtrack internally"

[17:52] <renormalist> then the "internally" is probably my answer.

[17:52] <renormalist> which it what it explains in 3.

[17:55] * renormalist is a bit surprised by the first usefule complex answer from a ChatGPT - if it doesn't tell rubbish, which I hope.

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - probably needs testing --- I was surprised at how good the answer was also --- my theory is that raku is underdocumented on the web in general so it probbaly only had one relevant source text and didnt try to weave together a bunch of similar but different texts

[17:58] <renormalist> That's my explanation, too.

[17:59] <renormalist> so thanks, this helps me further.

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> With relevant prompts, LLMs know Raku very well.
