[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Awww beans

[20:11] <ab5tract> hmm, that's a bit surprising

[20:17] <ab5tract> lizmat: it seems that we are holding it wrong.. tried searching for more info on your dev.to and in rakudoweekly but didn't see anything yet

[20:18] <lizmat> finanalyst wrote about it on dev.to

[20:18] <lizmat> draig

[20:22] <ab5tract> ah, that will help for sure. but ISTR that there was an NL localization and several others that were finished

[20:22] <lizmat> they live in https://github.com/raku/L10N/ now

[20:28] <ab5tract> ah! thanks

[20:29] <ab5tract> ohnowendigo: I hope that clears things up a bit
