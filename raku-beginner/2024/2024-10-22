[04:33] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> hello all, I am trying some examples for a TCP server and I am trying to print the raw buffer but the whole buffer is not shown when say($buf) is used

[04:33] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> what else will show the whole buffer?

[04:35] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> dd shows things better

[12:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj Maybe converting the content $bug would produce better results?

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> or will I be able to receive it with encoding

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> ?

[12:42] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> $buf = $conn.recv(:bin) is what is in the example

[12:43] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> it would be nicer if I can get that in utf8, then I can use the Raku grammar magic to full use

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I am able to receive it as utf8 in Dlang but I will have to use the PEGGED module there - but after getting used to Raku grammars it is very difficult to use anything else

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> it sort of spoils you

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is link of what I found to work for images (similar to what you wrote above): https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Image-Markup-Utilities/blob/939a2845f5228301eff165f35e950f15bff60aa7/lib/Image/Markup/Utilities.rakumod#L76

[12:45] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> thank you sir, let me look it up

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> multi method new(         :$localhost,         :$localport,         :$family = PF_INET,         :$listen,         :$encoding = 'utf-8',         :$nl-in = "\r\n",     --> IO::Socket::INET:D)

[13:27] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> does this mean that utf8 is the default encoding in this method?

[13:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Most likely. This can be verified with a suitable test.

[13:29] <lizmat> m: sub a(:$encoding = "foo") { say $encoding }; a

[13:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar d964ec93a: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[13:32] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> thanks

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> wow, I didnt know that you can pass a function to an WHERE clause to sanitize an argument, but seems to work - does it lead to performance problems?

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I am asking because I remember Jonathon talking about (lot of) WHERE clauses causing things to slow down with multiple dispatch

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> dont want to go overboard and sprinkle too much of those

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> m: sub ten(){return 10};sub test(Int $a where ten() < * <= 20, Int $b where * >20){say "OK: $a $b";};test(15,30)

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  OK: 15 30 

[16:35] *** dakkar left
[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> m: sub ten(){return 10};sub test(Int $a where ten() < * <= 20, Int $b where * >20){say "OK: $a $b";};test(9,30)

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$a'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Int (9)   in sub test at main.raku line 1   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think that particular part of multiple dispatch was optimized.

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> m: my $a = Buf[uint8].new(0xA2,0xB6);$a.decode('UTF-8')

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 Malformed UTF-8 at line 1 col 1   in block <unit> at main.raku line 1  

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Hello, how can use this particular exception in a CATCH block so that I can catch this exception accurately

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I mean, how can I find out what sort of a exception it is

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> so that I can use a given to catch just this exception

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> m: {my $a = Buf[uint8].new(0xA2,0xB6);$a.decode('UTF-8')}; CATCH {default {.WHAT.say;}}

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  (AdHoc) 

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj I think you already getting what you are looking for. Look into the structure of the failure object.

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, what you see with CATCH {default {.raku.say;} ?

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> ja, got it thanks

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think there is payload attribute.

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> @antononcube - are not all arguments passed as Value in Raku?

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> or do we have any exceptions there?

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> for example, for Buf[uint8]  etc

[19:17] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, by value, but you can use rw.

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube>  sub modify-reference($x is rw) {     $x = 10; } 

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... Buf[uint8] is a concretization of a generic class...

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can also use rw to class attributes.

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://docs.raku.org/type/Attribute#trait_is_rw

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> say $buf;             say is_it_malformed($buf);             say    "After:";             say    $buf;

[19:23] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> the first say shows me the contents, but the 2nd say does not

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> sorry -let me do a few more checks

[19:25] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> maybe I was wrong, sorry

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hi arundel sounds great … maybe you can make an issue or pr over there and provides some basic examples and i can chime in??
