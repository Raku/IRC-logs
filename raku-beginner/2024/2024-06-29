[09:11] <lizmat> In way you can have it: create a submethod foo(|c) and pass the capture on with |c to a multi sub *inside* the scope of the submethid

[09:12] <lizmat> submethod foo(|c) { multi a(Int) { dd }; multi a(Str) { dd } }

[09:13] <lizmat> inside the subs, "self" will still refer to the self of the submethod, and thus attributes can be referred to as well
