[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> Hello everybody. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I've been having some problems with imported symbols in IDE's. I tried VSCode and Comma IDE but both fail to detect modules in the project when I "use" them. I'm new to Raku so maybe I'm doing something wrong?

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> I'd appreciate any help

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> I'm using Windows 11 with Rakudo star installed from scoop, the IDE is Comma CE 2023.08

[12:47] <ab5tract> pro1dream: unfortunately exported routines are not currently supported

[12:47] <ab5tract> They are high on my wishlist though

[12:48] <ab5tract> Now that comma is open source and running on the latest intellij version, I think we can get there

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> aah, understood. Thank you for the reply

[14:13] <ab5tract> pro1dream: btw, Comma 2.0 is on the way :) https://5ab5traction5.bearblog.dev/introducing-comma-20/

[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> that's great! looking forward to test it ðŸ˜„

[14:13] <ab5tract> I'm about to press a new beta at github that should hopefully fix a major issue with opening existing Comma projects

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <pro1dream> nice!
