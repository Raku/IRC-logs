[19:14] <habere-et-disper> Please can someone explain the rationale/chesterton-fence as to why combing an integer produces strings rather than Int or say IntStr ?

[20:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: I'm a bit confused by your question - to my mind, the purpose of comb is to take a Str and product a Seq of it's characters, so it would be natural to coerce an Int first argument to a Str. It would be pretty easy to convert this Seq to contain Ints or Allomorphs, but I'm not sure that there is a general use-case for that so I guess you have to write it.
