[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I have a very silly question about Raku

[16:24] <lizmat> .oO( does it also fly upside down ?)

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> no it was more along the lines of is there a way to separately typecheck and compile raku code without running it

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> like compile it?

[16:31] <lizmat> raku -c foo.raku

[16:32] <lizmat> note however that that *will* run BEGIN blocks and CHECK blocks

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> thanks!
