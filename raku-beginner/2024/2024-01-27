[00:08] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> update: so it's definitely exporting &postfix<USD>, but for some reason i'm not able to call it as a postfix operator

[02:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @antononcube that's a possible use-case for later, but it's not the primary reason for making this library

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry - had to sleep

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub postfix:<USD>(Rat $a){say $a}; 37.02USD;

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  37.02 

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ postfix works afaict

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I did not account for the already high overloading of the '$' dollar sign (eg for variable sigils) in raku, so I have not been able how to suppress the compiler thinking you are making a syntax error

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub prefix:<¬ß>(Rat $a){say $a}; ¬ß37.02;

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  37.02 

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub prefix:<$>(Rat $a){say $a}; $37.02;

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/glot/main.raku Malformed postfix call at /home/glot/main.raku:1 ------> sub prefix:<$>(Rat $a){say $a}; $37.‚èè02; 

[11:38] <lizmat> This is because $37 is short for $/[37]   which is valid syntax for the 38th positional match

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> me I would reach for unicode (but that's not to everyone's taste)

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub prefix:<üí∞>(Rat $a){say $a}; üí∞37.02;

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  37.02 

[11:39] <lizmat> m: sub prefix:<$>(Rat $a){say $a}; $ 37.02   # all you need is a space

[11:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar aa1b89daf: OUTPUT: ¬´37.02‚ê§¬ª

[11:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: is there a way to use $ symbol in a prefix / circumfix?

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .oO

[11:40] <lizmat> I guess if we created a pragma to disallow $37 from being legal syntax, it could work

[11:40] <lizmat> without space

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> up to arun if they want it

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> imo the space is not really an issue - just have to set expectations in the docs

[11:42] <lizmat> yes, that would be my thought as well

[11:42] <lizmat> having $0 work is quite valuable

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ;-)

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: sub circumfix:<$ USD>(Rat() $a){say $a}; $ 37.02 USD;

[11:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  37.02 

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> looks like you need to go $-ws-XXX-ws-USD (ie space before the postfix also)

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> NB: I added the coercion type of Rat() since I would like to take whole numbers and decimals (leaving it to arun to may a subset Curr of Rat if they want)

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'm getting an email saying that META couldn't be read properly,

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> json {   "auth": "zef:arunvickram",   "build-depends": [   ],   "depends": [   ],   "description": "A library to facilitate using monetary values in Raku",   "name": "Moneys",   "source-url": "https://github.com/arunvickram/Moneys.git",   "provides": {     "Money": "lib/Moneys.rakumod"   },   "resources": [   ],   "test-depends": [   ],   "version": "0.0.3" } 

[20:18] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> this looks right, right?

[20:31] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @lizmat i don't think being able to do my $x = $37.99 at the cost of disabling syntax is worth it imho

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> nvm it worked, i guess there was somethng up this morning is all

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Apologies for not fixing this sooner

[21:48] *** DarthGandalf left
[21:48] *** DarthGandalf joined
[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine should be fixed

[22:03] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I was playing with Money <-> Red integration: https://gist.github.com/FCO/558d0e32ed620e0a6cee6799141e0f36

[22:05] <SmokeMachine> If I enable debug, these are the SQL it shows: https://gist.github.com/FCO/455a9aa62d3d6740674d8b5e27c5c442

[22:08] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine I don't think we want to be storing Money as JSON, i think standard practice is to have the amount go to one column and the currency go to the other column

[22:43] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'm gonna play around with a couple of things

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine while you're at it, try installing Moneys again

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it should work

[22:53] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EIg0UEtW/image.png

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Looks like it hasn't updated to version 0.0.3 on your end

[23:08] <SmokeMachine> The same as before, but with real Moneys https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/9n8LHDn2/

[23:24] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine i'm getting this error when trying to install Red

[23:25] <SmokeMachine> you need install pq (from postgress), or exclude it from install

[23:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> very neat example! is there a variant where all values are one currency and that is just stored once - but can be parametrised ?

[23:29] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Postgres as in the library postgres for Raku or postgres as the postgres database and pg_* programs? @SmokeMachine

[23:33] <SmokeMachine> DB::Pg

[23:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it's trying to install pq but it's not able to find pq on raku.land or anything it looks like

[23:37] <SmokeMachine> DB::Pg is trying to install it

[23:38] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: sorry, were you talking about Red+Money example?

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Right, I tried installing pq on my own but it looks like it's not able to install it

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> It's unable to find it

[23:42] <SmokeMachine> libpq

[23:43] *** hudo_ left
[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> libpq is already installed on my machin

[23:55] <SmokeMachine> I had to create a link on my system to the right place to make it work‚Ä¶
