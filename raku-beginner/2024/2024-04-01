[21:07] <habere-et-disper> Using mod not div ?

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @habere-et-disper  Hi! I do not see you in IRC...

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> habere-et-disper: here is the same in python...

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  >>> 1 % 0 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ZeroDivisionError: integer modulo by zero >>>  

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> not sure what you expect since modulo is divide by and then return the remainder

[21:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ;-)

[21:44] <habere-et-disper> Was set in the wrong directioin as code had both div and mod so thought the div was the issue when the error message guided me there.
