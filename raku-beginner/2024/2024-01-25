[20:14] <petlib> Hi, I tried the code snippet on https://raku.guide/#_using_modules and got error: You cannot create an instance of this type (Digest::MD5) in block <unit> at md5.raku line 3".

[20:16] <petlib> installed module Test::Util::ServerPort with zef, And this module works fine.

[20:17] <petlib> rakudo is installed via rakudo-pkg on ubuntu

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> petlib: what version of raku are you running? try raku -v

[20:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (typically the apt type installers are not up to date, I recommend rakubrew.org)

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> petlib: I tried this example on my machine ... got same error, so I have opened an issue here https://github.com/hankache/rakuguide/issues/230 ... meantime,

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  use Abbreviations; my $words = 'A ab Abcde'; # The main exported routine: my %abbrevs = abbreviations $words; say %abbrevs.gist; # OUTPUT: «{A => A, Abcde => Ab, ab => a}␤» 

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ here's a different example picked at random from raku.land

[21:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that I have tested
