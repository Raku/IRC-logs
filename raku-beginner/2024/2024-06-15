[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Anyone using Mustache with Raku? Wondering if this is the way to go: https://raku.land/cpan:SOFTMOTH/Template::Mustache

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @pelevesque - I have done a quick look at template options (for minimal static website deployment) and Mustache  was at the top of my list ... but then I got sidetracked ;-(

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I tried that Template::Mustache and it works great. Mustache feels magical.

[20:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> cool

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> {I think its a great fit for languages with curlies, like raku}

[21:54] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I'm using it to generate postscript code to make a graphical musical score. Raku sets some variables for the postscript code that changes from page to page.
