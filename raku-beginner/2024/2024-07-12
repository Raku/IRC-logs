[17:54] <cioran> Hey! Is there more GUI stuff for raku or perl5? Kind of confused havent used perl in years. Have to use something in perl that works great wanto to do a GUI for a cmd line software for some colleagues

[17:57] <lizmat> something like https://raku.land/zef:japhb/Terminal::Widgets ?

[18:03] <cioran> Nice!

[18:03] <cioran> Thx bookmarking

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, TUI is not GUI.

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Are considering making a GUI app with Raku?

[18:35] <cioran> Nevermind I think I got it sorted, doing tk w/perl thx guys
