[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Guest30 - I recommend you try App::Mi6 to create / template your module â€¦thatâ€™s does a lot of the META6.json work for you â€¦ you can use zef install . locally and you need to use fez to release your finished code to the module repo.

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> When you just play around you might be able to run the tests like raku -l . -M module::to::load basic-tests.rakutest  ensuring your test-file finds everything you use 

[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> this includes the current dir in the folders beeing searched and loads some modules upfront.

[08:58] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> PS: I actually do not know of it is of any use, but I like to include â€”optimize=3  in the raku calls. ðŸ˜€

[09:02] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> (like rally stripes make your car go faster :-)

[09:03] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Maybe letâ€˜s clear that out: what does â€”optimize=3 actually do - in my pet-benchmarks I did not find evidence for improvements .
