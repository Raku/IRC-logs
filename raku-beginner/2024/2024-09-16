[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lol (now I know how to get things prioritized)

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: Q|my Inf $n = Inf|.AST.EVAL

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Exit code: 1 ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling  Cannot assign a literal of type Num (Inf) to a variable of type Num.  You can declare the variable to be of type Cool, or try to coerce the value with Inf.Num or Num(Inf), or just write the value as Inf. at line  

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> just checking if Â±Inf tracking NaN... yep same improvement
