[01:11] <ab5tract> I don't think there is any significant advantage to doing a zef install vs the above, but I may be wrong

[15:54] <renormalist> ab5tract: link fixed, thnaks for checking

[15:57] <renormalist> libreasteve: yeah, and ACK on strong and optional. The funny thing is that I already can't reproduce that initial trouble. There is really a very thin window of confusion in which I seem to have promptly tripped. I think what happens is:

[15:59] <renormalist> My idea was to port existing Perl code. And existing code contains several of those pitfalls in combination, In particular wrong function calls foo(1,2,3) instead of foo([1,2,3]), then the absence of type on undefined values which lead to warnings which I searched in the wrong places.

[16:00] <renormalist> Then also using is() in tests which has its own DWIMery, leading to similar yet unrelated warnings and actual type problems around undef/Nil.

[16:00] <renormalist> All that does not happen when following the migration guide from Perl where you still type new code, i.e. from the pov of the guide, not your own cut'npasted Perl code.

[16:01] <renormalist> So I think I am over that bump on the road myself now. I try hard to remember it when the next one comes around with similar problems.

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @renormalist Do you use LLMs? I can try to make a configuration for "LLM::DWIM" that might fit your Raku quests.

[16:04] <renormalist> But the real lesson is: Perl does not have types and the DWIM is built into the language. While Raku has real type and the DWIM is built into *some* of those *types* instead of the language, so that it works similar in "standard cases" like handling strings that look like numbers in typical arithmetic operations. That DWIM however requires to start with those types

[16:05] <renormalist> And I tripped into mixing types, I *think* by starting with wrong function calls from my own test suite. I do these "lucky" stunts regularly.

[16:07] <renormalist> antononcube: not sure what LLM here means. A Large Language Model? But whatever the offer means, I am fine to learn how Raku works and adapt my wrong expectations. It is fine if that hurts. So if you want to free me from that pain: nice and thanks, but No I'm fine. :-)

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yes, "Large Language Model" == LLM.

[16:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> OK, I need to make an LLM persona to argue with you that you are not fine.

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Nevertheless, I think expanding "LLM::DWIM" and "Jupyter::Kernel" with pre-loaded Raku-expert LLM persona(s) is a good idea. So, I will do some of that in the next few days.

[16:13] <renormalist> That's probably with a :-) from me, though I have no idea if you are kidding me. And because I'm meta all the way down I can put a real smiley here. :-) 

[16:14] <renormalist> s/with/worth/; s/kidding/fooling/

[16:14] <renormalist> :)

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmmm...  yeah, should have emojified some of my statements above...

[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I was referring to say "Eliza" or Emacs' "psychotherapist".

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My comments about LLM DWIM are "for real" -- you mentioned/discussed Raku-DWIMish features.

[16:28] <renormalist> I thought so, was just unsure because you know: "Perl can do everything. Raku will do more." and it might have been something crazy I would be seriously missing out. One never knows.

[16:32] <renormalist> Is anybody remembering that reference at all? I'm referring to the summary scene in this video around minute 6:29: https://youtu.be/vymCfnxcEy0?feature=shared&t=389

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My opinion: - Python : ðŸ¤® ðŸ¤®  - Perl : ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Should be emojified enough... ðŸ‘†)

[16:37] <renormalist> Bummer, I didn't want to trigger anything, assume I deleted my lines. I came through time and space to here and found it funny back then, but it's not the topic of this channel. Was just clarifying the reference.

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Reference is fine, and good to know.

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I personally, do not care that much about channel policies...

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @renormalist Aslo, I would like to point out that I started ðŸ¤® when seeing Perl code after using Raku for a couple of years. (So, be warned...)

[17:05] <renormalist> lizmat: no urls here? sorry

[17:05] <renormalist> oh, the guy Uri you mean?

[17:05] <lizmat> yeah...
