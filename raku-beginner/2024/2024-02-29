[22:08] <Manifest0> How do i display a unicode flag in raku? I'm trying to display for example the EU flag and i only get the letters EU... 

[22:09] <Manifest0> I'm using the codes from https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html

[22:09] <Manifest0> say "\x1F1EA\x1F1FA" -> EU

[23:15] <lizmat> Manifest0: perhaps this can be of service?  https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Text::Flags

[23:20] <Manifest0> lizmat, it will for now thanks!

[23:23] <Manifest0> it still doesn't work. So i guess it's an issue in my system.

[23:24] <Manifest0> say "%flags<NL>"; just prints NL

[23:24] <Manifest0> :-|

[23:26] <Manifest0> oh. It's my terminal. 

[23:26] <Manifest0> with konsole it works fine
