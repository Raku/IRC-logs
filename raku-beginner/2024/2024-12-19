[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I am hoping to add red to my basic website examples pretty soon - do you have a "best practice" installation you can point to ... or just let me know what is the primary backend to target

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> While I would prefer mysql (since I already have a number of WordPress sites that use that), I think postgres would be comparable and all I am doing is stuff like dump, import, user perms in the setup / site management side.

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am also tempted by sqllite - on the one hand that would be great for GH integrations - just clone and run / or commit and push a state ... on the other it is not quite as serious as MySQL / postgres for a website tool that aims for some credibility as a way for tech savvy business to deploy and maintain small to medium sites which is kin of where I think we should be aiming (in the spirit of the early

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> success of ruby on rails)

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also I see that Red has DBIish as a dependency and that DBIish supports MySQL / MariaDB ... so curious why you don't just get that for free

[18:08] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I currently consider SQLite more serious than MySQL... it is the most deployed DB in the world...

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx - kudos on the awesome Red docs!

[18:11] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: Red uses DBIish, bu Red::Driver is much more than a connection layer... it have to know how to translate Red::AST to SQL specific to the DB being used...

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> notes that stuff like this https://turso.tech uses sqlite and decides to lead with that for now

[18:13] <SmokeMachine> for example: (this is the Red MySQL driver I'm writing based on Red's CommonSQL driver): https://github.com/FCO/Red-Driver-MySQL/blob/main/lib/Red/Driver/MySQL.pm6

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> .oO

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that's some beautiful code dude

[18:18] <SmokeMachine> thanks :)

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> adding MySQL support would be a great mid level intro to raku coding for a budding core dev

[18:26] <SmokeMachine> Yes... I need to go back to that...

[18:26] <SmokeMachine> If someone would like to help on that...

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> humbly I suggest we would benefit from migrations more than from the MySQL (and likely only you have the insight to do that)

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^ since that's the industry standard

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (I think Cro has this also ... but not sure if that's relevant)

[18:30] <SmokeMachine> https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15

[18:31] <SmokeMachine> I even did a talk about that... the most confusing and boring talk I ever did... :)

[18:32] <SmokeMachine> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YHRAl-mFm0&t=5s

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks, but no thanks!

[18:34] <SmokeMachine> ??? no the issue thread? no the talk video? no help? sorry, I got confused... :)

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw did my comment on the reentrancy of Cromponent make sense?

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> - just joking that you shared the link to the most confusing and boring talk you ever did ;-)

[18:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> actually I saw your talk already and I learned a lot ...

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I will watch again when I get a chance

[18:52] <SmokeMachine> 18:48 <SmokeMachine> I still need som time on that… I still don’t get why not adding the component only once…

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no problem
