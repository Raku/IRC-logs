[01:16] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> you don't need the redundancy between unit module and class - right now your class is living at `MothTrap::Exceptions::NotFoundException::NotFoundException``

[01:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @briandouglas_71953 How related that package is to the "moth joke" of Norm McDonald?

[08:12] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> Haha, no but I just watched it üòÑ

[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> Thanks for this. So what I am understanding is that module symbols can't reused. I was trying to use it like a PHP namespace. But it looks like I can't declare multiple files with unit module MothTrap::Exception; for example.

[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> I was thinking I could group multiple files under module MothTrap::Exception; and access the classes from those files like so: module MothTrap::Exception::MyClass;

[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> I'm still struggling to get my head around how they are resolving. It's not clear to me at all. Which is surprising as up untill this I've not had an issue getting my head around any language features.

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Yeah, I also had a lot of trouble with the namespace/module stuff, and honestly still only understand it well enough to get by üôÇ

[13:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There should be a dedicated LLM persona for that.

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Oh sorry, this is also just flat out wrong.

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I might make some "Raku school" LLM personas for TRC-2024. (If it is going to be held.)

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> in your case I think it's not working because you're missing is export on your exception classes

[13:47] <lizmat> antononcube a full-blown TRC-2024 will not be organized 

[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Good to know!

[13:48] <lizmat> however, rumour has it that finanalyst is thinking of organizing a Raku Developer Summit in Cardiff

[13:48] <lizmat> two days after the London Perl and Raku Workshop

[13:48] *** jgaz joined
[13:49] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is it going to be (partly) virtual?

[13:49] <lizmat> so that'd be 28/29 October

[13:49] <lizmat> I doubt it: it will be closer to a Hackathon than to a real Conference

[13:50] <lizmat> a requirement to attend would be that you have at least one module in the Raku ecosystem

[13:51] <lizmat> anyways, if you were planning to go to the LPRW, you could sleep late into Sunday, catch a ~ 1 hour train to Cardiff and be in time for the pre-Summit social

[16:30] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/07/29/2024-31-mondrianally/

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> How to load a module "B", so its exported symbols be available in current namespace when a certain other module "A" is loaded?  The module "A" depends on module "B".

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> To be clear, if "B" exports the sub/symbol  &f , I want to be able to do this:  raku use A; say &f(3); 

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is this something I can do with phasers like BEGIN or INIT /

[16:42] <lizmat> no, but you can with an EXPORT sub: https://docs.raku.org/syntax/sub%20EXPORT

[16:43] <lizmat> sub EXPORT { Map.new: '&f' => &f }

[16:44] <lizmat> or give it whatever other name you want

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Agh, yes, EXPORT I read a few times that page (or versions of it), but did not occur to me that it can be used...

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> is definitely up for LPRW London and the Cardiff Raku Developer Summit ‚Ä¶ I live in Reading so on the line in between and happy to help if folk have logistics questions

[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @librasteve So, do you or do you not accept overnight guests?

[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (Feel free not to answer -- that is too much putting "on the spot"...)
