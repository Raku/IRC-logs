[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF>  say $addition.function()(1, 2);   # OUTPUT: «3␤» # OR say $addition.function.(1, 2);    # OUTPUT: «3␤» is the () at the start explicit syntactic sugar for . in this case or is the fact that ()( and .( are the same a coincidence

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF>  sub squared( Int $num ) { $num² }; say squared($_) for ^5; # OUTPUT: «0␤1␤4␤9␤16␤»  what's ^ for in ^5?

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> Oh that's a range

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> .() is short for () like .[] is for [] etc. (postcircumfixes listed here are the others)

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> operators are functions in disguise, sometimes they are in methods

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> in the case of these postcircumfix ones, the invocant is to implement CALL-ME etc.

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> that it's all uppercase means it's not expected to be called from the user side; it2s automatically called by the compiler when the corresponding sugar happens, i.e., .() for CALL-ME

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> kind of like the dunders of Python

[21:51] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> in your first example, we infer that $addition.function is itself a callable and also evaluates to one

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> last thing to note is if you only "mention" the name of a callable (without & in front, so it's in the "verb" form, not "noun"), it gets called automatically

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> that's in play in the 3rd line in your first example

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <sampersand—2B +| +^2B == FF> i got my example from teh operators page. I guess i wasnt super clear: .function.(1,2)  makes sense, and it works if function is a field, because that way you aren't trying to call the method function like you would .function(1,2).   What's not clear to me is why .function()(1,2) works the same way: wouldnt that call the field function with no args, then call that return value with two

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> args?
