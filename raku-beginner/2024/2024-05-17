[08:45] <wafflus> how do i compare a substet of two lists

[08:46] <wafflus> like the list on the left is a complete subset of the list on the right

[09:27] <wafflus> its ok i found what i needed

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I guess you used the set subset operator?

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Or "Algorithm::Diff" ?

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I am big fan of the Unicode operators (write code once, read code 10 times)

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m: say (1,2,3) ⊆ (1,2,3,4,5)

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m: say 'c'..'q' ⊂ 'd'..'z'

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  False 

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> so for me personally the effort of copy/paste the operators from https://docs.raku.org/language/operators is less then the gain during reading of the same code

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz That indicates that you are using Raku on Windows or Linux.
