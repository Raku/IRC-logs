[14:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat The first example in this post summarizes your latest post: https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2024/03/26/omni-slurping-with-llming/

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Hello all, is there a problem with the fez server?

[17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I am not able to do any zef installs or updates

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj Yes, there is a problem with fez/raku.land/Zef ecosystem. I complained in the main IRC channel.

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> They are looking into it...

[17:11] <lizmat> fwiw, I am able to install modules with zef...  

[17:11] <lizmat> what is the error message that you get ?

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not get error messages with zef  or  fez -- I just do not see my uploads in raku.land and https://360.zef.pm .

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Zef update

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> !!! > Failed to update fez mirror: https://360.zef.pm/

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Zef install XML::Class ==> Fetching [Fail]

[18:38] <lizmat> winfreddraj  works for me without errors, so maybe some firewalling in place?

[18:38] <lizmat> if you try to open https://360.zef.pm/ in a browser, what do you get ?

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Then it opens up

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I tried in Wsl and in powershell

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Also in Termux

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Let me try again in Termux

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> It works in Termux and Nix-on-Droid in my mobiles

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> So that means it is a problem in my laptop, something common  for both Wsl and powershell

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I'll check the firewall like you suggested

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Thanks Lizmat

[18:58] <lizmat> you're welcome!

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Hello Lizmat, can you please let me know the zef version you are using

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> 0.21.2 does not work in my laptop

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> 0.21.4 works in my mobile

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I'm trying to update rstar - let's see if that helps

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> It was a firewall problem, could fix the problem in powershell

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Wsl is still giving problems, let's see

[23:21] *** jaguart left
[23:38] <lizmat> winfrederaj 0.21.4
