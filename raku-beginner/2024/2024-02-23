[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <doodler8888> printing the '$repos' variable gives '(Pipe)' at the end of the output:   my $repos = shell("find ~/ -type d -name '.git'   -not -path '*/.local/*' -not -path '*/.share/*' -printf '%p\n' 2>/dev/null").out; say $repos;   The output example:  /home/username/.cache/paru/clone/nvm/.git /home/username/.cache/paru/clone/hadolint-bin/.git /home/username/.cache/paru/clone/lem-editor-git/.git (Pipe)  is there any

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> quick way to remove the '(Pipe)' line?

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> so by default the STDOUT goes to STDOUT and you don't specify something for the :$out parameter of the shell, so this is the case for you

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> what I mean is, if you comment say $repos, you'll see the ".git" outputs still

[12:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> and "(Pipe)" won't be there

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> that's because by doing .out you get a handle on the STDOUT, which is a special IO::Pipe object, and it prints its string form at the end

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i hope this makes sense, and a fix for your desired outcome is, e.g., pass :out to shell function which means out => True but in a short form

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> and the documentation says that if you pass True there, it will do: > Setting one (or more) of them to True makes the stream available as an IO::Pipe object of the same name, like for example $proc.out

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <doodler8888> aah, got it, thx!

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> and shell returns a Proc object, so now you'll be able to do: raku my $repos = shell("...", :out); say $repos.out.slurp(:close) 

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> no problem
