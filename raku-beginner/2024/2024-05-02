[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I suppose, using Linux or MacOS is the easiest and quickest fix to windows-max-path-length problems.

[12:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> here the fix PR to correct the documents - thanks for pointing this out Actually this issue arose in the rakuguide examples, not raku docs  Here's the fix PR https://github.com/hankache/rakuguide/pull/231

[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the example should be use Digest::MD5;  my $password = "password123"; my $hashed-password = md5( $password );  say $hashed-password;

[12:05] <lizmat> librasteve:  "whic"  ?

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: huh?
