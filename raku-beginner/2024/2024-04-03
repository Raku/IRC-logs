[13:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Tirifto: thanks for coming back ... glad to hear that that resolved it --- reminds me to pick back up the incremental improvements I was making to rakudo.org (such as discouraging *nix package manager versions of raku)

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ikarus: I think that you are on the right track with Hummingbird --- where the emphasis is on simple

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I just picked up Mustache (for a non-html templating project) but have not actually done anything with it yet - I see that Rawley uses it in his rende rexamples here https://github.com/rawleyfowler/Humming-Bird/blob/d551d0146ceeb153b733f93dbeaa0e23d138477d/examples/mvc/lib/App/Foo/Render.rakumod#L2]

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my guess is that HummingBird is template language agnostic - seems that you have a lot of other options https://raku.land/?page=1&q=template

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Humming-Bird is a simple, composable, and performant web-framework for Raku on MoarVM. Humming-Bird was inspired mainly by Sinatra, and Express, and tries to keep things minimal, allowing the user to pull in things like templating engines, and ORM's on their own terms.

[15:18] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> What are the problems with using *nix and Rakudo?

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the native package managers like apt and yum provide very old versions of raku

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Ah, I had the impression you are talking about NixOS. Just checked Ubuntu Mantic (23.10) and Debian Bookwork (stable) - both have Rakudo 22.12.  - if I did not do any mistake. Is that too old (for a stable distibution)?

[17:54] <Tirifto> @rcmlz, most likely yes. Debian Stable has Rakudo 2022.12, too, which contains a bug I just spent a while struggling with.

[17:56] <Tirifto> Then again, I suppose new versions can introduce new bugs, too, so it ultimately comes down to your use case. :-)
