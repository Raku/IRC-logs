[13:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Say a sub is provied by a package. After loading that package in the global namespace, is it possible to change the default value an argument of that sub?

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For example, Mathematica/WL has the function SetOptions  that allows that. (I try to quit thinking in WL terms when doing Raku, but without much success..,)

[13:08] <lizmat> antononcube maybe Routine.wrap is what you're looking for?   https://docs.raku.org/routine/wrap

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Yes, that routine seems to apply. (And yes, I have seen it and used before, but WL-thinking, blah, blah...)

[15:51] <ab5tract> assuming might also be a fit, but I havenâ€™t used it much

[15:56] <lizmat> assuming is a hornet's nest  :-(

[20:28] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> why?

[20:30] <lizmat> it's a twisty maze of code building source for an EVAL

[20:30] <lizmat> at least, the last time I looked  :-)

[20:31] <lizmat> afk&

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I thought it is currying, standard tool for/off functional folks. Not?

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> When I tried it, it worked fine (for my problem).

[21:00] <ab5tract> rcmlz: Yeah,  I think it's plenty safe for general use cases

[21:01] <ab5tract> Plenty of roast test cases for it, and the ones we expect to pass already do so

[22:29] * ab5tract makes a note to check whether any of these are #FixedInRakuAST :)
