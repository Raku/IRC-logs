[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well it's an error message with a stack trace - looks like you are missing some native library related to Term::termios ... often the mac is non-standard compared to linux and this module may need a manual install of the dev version of the lib with headers or similar

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> fwiw I have been using raku on my mac (via rakubrew) for years and I have never encountered this

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I do not trust/use non-rakubrew installations - so my first advice is use that (if you are not already)

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if the problems persists, then you will need to raise an issue in the relevant repo

[16:43] <ab5tract> aruniecrisps: that's definitely a bit odd..

[16:48] <ab5tract> it installs just fine for me\

[16:52] <ab5tract> I wonder if it is related to `asdf` somehow? was it working previously and then just started showing this issue?

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it might be an asdf thing
