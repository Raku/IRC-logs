[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Anyone can help a raku beginner? I have this string     54  34 185.00   F♯3 G♭3 Fs3 Gf3  I am wondering what is the easiest way to put 54 in one variable, 34 in other, 185.00 in a third, then the last 4 elements in one list together. I was thinking of splitting the string on spaces, and then in the array I find 0, 1, and 2, but is there a way to easily put together all elements after the 3rd in a list?

[04:25] <kjp> pelevesque: No need to join things back together again; just don't split them apart! split takes an optional second argument to specify how many pieces to split the input into; try something like "$string.split(/\s+/, 4)"

[05:16] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I found a super good solution with simply using .words

[05:16] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Thanks for that notion about the argument in split, I did not know this!

[05:17] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> I just came back today to Raku after months of Javascript only. God, it feels good. What a fantastic language. The best.

[18:51] <ab5tract> m: m:  my ($a, $b, $tempo, @notes) =  "54  34 185.00   F♯3 G♭3 Fs3 Gf3".split(/\s+/); dd :$a, :$b, :$tempo, :@notes

[18:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72b46fe29: OUTPUT: «:a("54")␤:b("34")␤:notes(["F♯3", "G♭3", "Fs3", "Gf3"])␤:tempo("185.00")␤»

[18:51] <ab5tract> pelevesque: an oldie but goodie ^^^ :)

[18:53] <ab5tract> only works with one list, though, and it has to be composed of elements from the end of the string. but it does fit your example pretty well

[19:02] <lizmat> with that split string, you could just say .words  :-)

[19:32] <ab5tract> good point. I always forget about that one
