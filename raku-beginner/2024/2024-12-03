[00:03] <ab5tract> fridge777: I'm also reaching my &sleep moment. If you remind me tomorrow, I can show you the tooling we have for bisecting these regressions.  That should at least provide the minimum fixed version to install that fixes this

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I like to deepen my Raku Grammar understanding. For that I like to solve some AOC tasks using Grammars. I got stuck here  https://gist.github.com/rcmlz/c2b08e3ed72bda09fb0eab158b92518d  Could someone perhaps give me a hint, why in line 7 the split by lines is not working?

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> My aim is to process each row directly in the Grammar Action class - but I can not workout how to get it row by row ...

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> A single row of numbers in this example is called a "report"

[19:05] <lizmat> my first thing to try would be to replaced <level>+ with .*?   and see if that parses

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> .*? did not help

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> if I just use .? it takes the whole input

[19:14] <lizmat> yeah, that's why the ? is there

[19:14] <lizmat> hmm

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> yes, I think the ^^ and $$ is not working as anticipated.  https://glot.io/snippets/h2dxf7r1vj

[21:28] <ab5tract> rcmlz: I hope this helps - https://glot.io/snippets/h2e16mlwmq

[21:28] <ab5tract> There’s an extraneous new line in the report match though

[21:28] <ab5tract> Can’t poke at it further tonight, unfortunately

[21:58] <ab5tract> rcmlz: here we go (I think) https://glot.io/snippets/h2e22irn84

[22:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lol - just beat me https://glot.io/snippets/h2e243y7vy

[22:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that said, maybe $input.lines>>.words>>.Int; is a bit less tricky!
