[01:38] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine I have a question about https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red

[01:38] <SmokeMachine> Please, ask

[01:40] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> what exactly does this error mean?

[01:40] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1210763142041305088/Screenshot_2024-02-23_at_8.39.50_PM.png?ex=65ebbe0b&is=65d9490b&hm=d8bfff948f679c439d26edfe77043a7d8f5016371e311ecc5f0ecf9d609bfa9d&

[01:42] <SmokeMachine> I suppose you have not imported Red…

[01:44] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> that explains it

[01:44] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> thanks

[01:46] <SmokeMachine> Or you could, probably, only import Red::Traits (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Traits.rakumod#L318)

[02:57] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Gotcha @SmokeMachine

[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Thanks for the help so far!

[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I have another question about Red, can it do database migrations?

[02:58] <SmokeMachine> I’m working on that… but not yet… :(

[03:00] <SmokeMachine> Would you like to help on that discussion? https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15

[03:07] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Sure!

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> <doodler8888> As i understand right now, raku doesn't autogenerate signature description for main subroutines with slurpy arrays:   sub MAIN(*@targets, Str :$link-location) {    for @targets -> $target {     my $abs-target = get_abs_path($target);     my $final-link-location = $link-location;     $final-link-location ~= "/{$abs-target.IO.basename}" if $final-link-location.IO.d;      mkdir

[15:29] <discord-raku-bot> $final-link-location.IO.dirname;      symlink $abs-target, $final-link-location;      say "Symbolic link created for $abs-target at $final-link-location";   } }   Is there any workaround instead of manually creating a description yourself?

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine what column type does Red translate Str to?

[16:35] <SmokeMachine> It seems to be varchar(256) (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Driver/CommonSQL.rakumod#L977) but you can set it to any type you want…

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Do you think it would be better to map it to text?

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> also i'm assuming that you would have to use inflators and deflators for that functionality right?

[16:37] <SmokeMachine> No

[16:38] <SmokeMachine> has Str $.bla is column{ :type<text> };

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> ah makes sense

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> By no, I mean about inflator deflator…

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> gotcha, i figured i'd suggest text as the default for string becaue it sqlite, maria/mysql and postgres all support it

[16:40] <SmokeMachine> About using text instead of varchar(255), yes… maybe that would make sense…  (I don’t really remember why it isn’t that way…)

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i'll open a PR so you can review it

[16:41] <SmokeMachine> Thanks

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I was also looking at Red::Jobber, and i have a couple of questions

[16:42] <SmokeMachine> I don’t think that’s working at this point…

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Never mind then, I'll have a look at it later

[16:45] <SmokeMachine> But what were you going to ask?

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I was gonna ask whether or not there was a way to have more direct multithreading access in Raku, but it might not be the right question to ask here

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Here's the PR btw

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/572

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> let me know if anything else needs changing

[16:50] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, I’m not with access to my computer… I’ll need to let to take a look later… do you know if the tests are passing?

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Let me double check

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'll pull them down

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I fixed the tests @SmokeMachine

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> How do I generate the sql for a create table using Red? @SmokeMachine

[17:33] <SmokeMachine> Model.^create-table; or schema(Model).create

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> No I mean like how would i generate the SQL output?

[17:35] <SmokeMachine> do you mean as a debug message? $*RED-DEBUG = True; ?

[17:35] <SmokeMachine> my $*RED-DEBUG = True;

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> yea, for right now I just want to manually migrate my database
