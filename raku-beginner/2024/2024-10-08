[04:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> maybe itâ€™s * as in Inf?

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> "Final" methods with no *%_ are very interesting

[17:42] <ab5tract> timemelon: I'm not sure why the docs don't include it but there is indeed a list in the Rakudo source

[17:43] <ab5tract> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/19a32df0077bf64cd765e0661be8ef457230108c/src/Raku/ast/expressions.rakumod#L312

[17:48] <lizmat> hmmm isn't that already part of OperatorProperties ?

[17:48] <lizmat> if not, it probably should

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> interesting! I don't see ?? on there, does it desugar to && somewhere along the line before this code?

[18:33] <ab5tract> timemelon: it's rather that it is not even considered for being "curried": https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/7d080edd9ef23ffd26490a3b07a6b568096910c6/src/Raku/ast/expressions.rakumod#L2895

[18:33] <ab5tract> it would need to have `is WhateverApplicable` there for that to be the case

[18:34] <ab5tract> I don't think that ternaries are a good fit for being primed, though
