[12:40] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I assume that failing installation of rakudo-star on certain platforms is best filed as an new issue here: https://github.com/rakudo/star

[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> looking into the github workflows it seems to be that windows-2019 and ubuntu-latest is used for building. Not sure if testing is done on other platforms - so reproducing errors might be a challenge for the maintainers.

[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Question to Grammars: I like to split a string into chunks of size x and size x-1, as many times as possible strings of length x, and subsequently strings of length x-1. I can not get it to work fully -I guess I am missing something - like an ?. But I can not get my head around that.  Find minimal example and test cases here:  https://gist.github.com/rcmlz/189df1e4386cf02492bf889b9ed242e5  Any hints?  PS: I

[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> managed to use parameters in Grammars, to pass in the length - good learning for me.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Or is it that rachet thing, because it needs to look backards?

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Solved this now - by calculating if I expect a shorter string or not.

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> not optimal, but good enough.
