[10:10] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> when I try to call .say on a Match, I get a 'Too many positionals passed' error

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon>  [0] > $_ = 'a1b2c3' a1b2c3 [1] > my $match = m/\d/ ｢1｣ [2] > say $match ｢1｣ [2] > $match.say Too many positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 2   in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1   in any <main> at /usr/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm line 1   in any <entry> at /usr/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm line 1 

[10:11] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> is this intended behaviour? if so why does it happen?

[10:13] <lizmat> that's a bug

[10:13] <lizmat> m: "a1b2c" ~~ m/\d/; $/.say
