[07:35] <ab5tract> Nothing technical, no

[08:09] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there is also -p to print $_ at the end of processing each line but well it requires what you want printed stored in $_, so might be less readable in this case

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882>  :/tmp$ <<< $'hi 445\nhere 78' raku -pe'$_ = m/\D* (\d*)/' ｢hi 445｣  0 => ｢445｣ ｢here 78｣  0 => ｢78｣

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> thanks for the tip! I had a play around with that and found .=match(...).=Str which is kinda neat too

[11:52] <ab5tract> ah yeah, implicit method dispatch on the topic is great
