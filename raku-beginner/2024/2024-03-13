[15:05] <Tigerpaws> Good morning! I was slowly joining the raku community about 5 years, but suddenly got a job that has lasted until last year. I'd like to re-join the community and help in the development of raku. I run the latest releases of Fedora and have used Perl since back in the late 80's. I wrote a few little programs in raku a few years ago, so I have some familiarity with raku. I even made a raku-notebook demo for a local linux users' grou

[15:05] <Tigerpaws> p. But that was then.  

[15:06] <Tigerpaws> I'd like to re-join the community now, but maybe start out a little easier - maybe doing testing. Is there anything I can do to get started ?

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> So, if you have a job you stay away from Raku. If jobless, then Raku it is.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Tigerpaws  > Is there anything I can do to get started ? Please install the LLM packages and start using Raku Chatbooks.

[15:35] <Tigerpaws> I'm fully retired, and not expecting to take another job ever again. Of course, never-say-never. 

[15:36] <Tigerpaws> Is it sufficient to use the rakudo compiler on distributed on Fedora? It says it is 2024.02? 

[15:52] *** Summer left
[15:52] *** Summer joined
[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Should be.

[16:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am very interested to get the package "Clipboard" to work on Linux. (In case that is of interested to you.)

[17:46] <SmokeMachine> Tigerpaws: if you would also to like Red (https://github.com/FCO/Red) it would be very helpful! :) (sorry, but if I see someone offering help, Iâ€™ll take it!!! :) )

[17:49] <Tigerpaws> Antononcube: I will look into it, but the clipboard in Linux is a bit tricky, since there are several clipboards involved. 

[17:51] <Tigerpaws> SmokeMachine: Interesting, but it looks like a rather large project. What exactyl is required here? I presume this is for testing...

[18:00] <SmokeMachine> Tigerpaws: if you would like using/testing it, it would be very helpfulâ€¦

[18:02] <SmokeMachine> Tigerpaws: helping on discussions like this one (https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15) would also be great!

[18:04] <SmokeMachine> Tigerpaws: helping reviewing and improving the documentation would help too: https://fco.github.io/Red/

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @Tigerpaws Yes, I am aware Linux clipboard(s) can be tricky. ðŸ™‚ That is why I am trying to "outsource it."

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> That, and I do not have Lunux distro handy...

[19:37] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Tigerpaws: if you like you can also help making Raku more popular by e.g implementing some of the missing excercises on platforms like Excercism - https://youtu.be/Qydbrdp22Vs?feature=shared
