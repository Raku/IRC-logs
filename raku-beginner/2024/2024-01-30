[02:09] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: by job scheduling, would something like this help? https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/560#issuecomment-1351798685

[02:45] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> yep this is what i mean by job scheduling, something that's backed by some database whether it be sql or redis @SmokeMachine

[03:02] <SmokeMachine> Iâ€™m planning to play with that idea and create a RedJob (or something like that) when I have some timeâ€¦

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I am having trouble running this short code with the --profile flag under Raku v2023.11 on MacOS  https://gist.github.com/rcmlz/2776406d70dacafacce8e8e96611233b  I run raku --profile calculator-the-game.raku and get   > raku --profile calculator-the-game.raku ok 1 - ok 2 - ok 3 - [1]    5923 segmentation fault  raku --profile calculator-the-game.raku   Is there anything I can do? I suspekt it has to do with

[13:56] <discord-raku-bot> EVAL, which is most likely also the bottleneck.

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I updated to v2024.01 - and now it worked.

[14:12] <lizmat> :-)

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think this question, or similar, has been asked here before: How I can "debug" messages from fez like "Error reading META from your last upload" ?

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there any way to see exactly where error happens?

[14:16] <lizmat> tonyo might know

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok.

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine if you want I can work on that as well

[15:06] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i need that anyways for my application

[15:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @arun Java (and many other programming languages) can be used in Raku via ZeroMQ.

[15:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I am not sure is this something you might invest time on. It depends how "indispensable" the Java libraries are.

[15:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i figured if we could leeverage something like JobRunr or another existing job runner but I figure it's probably better to do it in Raku

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'm looking at the Raku grammar and trying to build a tree sitter parser, but i'm scratching my head at what counts as a Raku identifier

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What is "tree sitter"?

[16:17] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: sure!

[16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @antononcube it's an incremental parser https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter, it's used in things like generating better context-aware syntax highlighters that can be used in vim, emacs, vscode, etc. and it can also be used in security scanners like https://semgrep.dev/docs/contributing/adding-a-language/, overall it's a single format that can be used in multiple contexts

[16:18] <SmokeMachine> antononcube: it's a tool that parsers code and creates a kind of AST to IDEs have more information about that code

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @arun What is exactly you are trying to do, though? Do you want to make a Raku-aware editor or editor extension, or you "just" want to deparse certain Raku expressions?

[16:19] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it's the former, i'm trying to make a more Raku aware editor extension

[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... A few people worked Raku extensions for Emacs and Visual Studio Code. Those might be a start. Otherwise, a "generic" answer would be https://github.com/drforr/perl6-Perl6-Parser .

[16:22] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But is it possible to just to Raku bindings to existing tree-sitter libraries? (In whatever language.)

[16:23] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Maybe, Perl tree-sitter implementations or bindings can be relatively easily converted to Raku ones.

[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Unfortunately, their setup is peculiar, the grammar is written javascript, from which the tree-sitter executable generates rust and c

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is the JavaScript grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) or something similar to BNF? If yes, then you might "just" need a BNF for Raku.

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> (I assume a subset of Raku can be implemented in a tree-sitter functionality.)

[16:42] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Can this Perl tree-sitter repository be modified to be a Raku one? https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> It probably could be, I'm trying to figure out the nuances of Raku vs Perl

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @arun They seem to be described here: https://docs.raku.org/introduction

[17:02] <tonyo> antoncube: are you getting that in an email or on the command line?

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Yes, I am getting the message in an email.

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Many emails, at this point... ðŸ™‚

[17:32] <tonyo> when was the last time you sent it up? or can you send one right now while i'm in the logs looking?

[17:32] <tonyo> working on a way to give you realtime feedback so you'll see an error from fez directly, in the testing phase of it

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. I will make a new submission. My old submission was on 2024-01-28 21:20 ET .

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The package/module is "DSL::Bulgarian".

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Sorry, slight delay with my new submission -- I making sure I can install it on a different computer.

[18:06] <tonyo> it looks like maybe you're having the same issue guifa was having

[18:06] <tonyo> what version are you trying to upload?

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> DSL::Bulgarian:ver<0.1.1>

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo I think I found a potential culprit -- I am requesting in the META6.json of "DSL::Bulgarian" a package version that is way ahead of the one submitted last.

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Just submitted a new attempt and got an email saying: "Error reading META from your last upload".

[18:40] <tonyo> can you drop the bundle somewhere so i can inspect locally?

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is a GitHub repository going to work?

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is the repository: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-DSL-Bulgarian

[21:02] <tonyo> can you do the bundle?  `fez upload --save-autobundle` if you're using fez

[21:03] <tonyo> will have an `sdist/` folder in current dir

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Sorry, I was away ...

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @tonyo Yes, I can do the bundle. I got "Hey! You did it! Your dist will be indexed shortly."

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And a new bundle...

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> And a new email "Error reading META from your last upload"...
