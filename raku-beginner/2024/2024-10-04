[06:16] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.doom5771> just got back to using raku after a long time   say so "32.51" ~~ &number;                         # OUTPUT: «True␤»  say so "15 + 4.5" ~~ /<number>\s* '+' \s*<number>/ # OUTPUT: «True␤»   why are they using so here?

[06:33] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Hmm... Where does "number" come from?

[07:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> (probably my regex number or similar)

[07:58] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> they are using so to get a Boolean result out of the smartmatch: True if the regex match succeded, False otherwise

[07:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> if you don't so it, it will give you the resultant Match object (or Nil if no match)

[07:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> but sometimes you only care if it matches or not; not what part of the string matched etc.

[08:29] <lizmat> if you're interested in speed and only *if* it matches, you can do .contains(/.../), which doesn't create a relatively expensive Match object
