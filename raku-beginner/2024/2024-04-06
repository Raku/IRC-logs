[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I was curious. There was, some 8 years ago, a rakudo-star package in Debian. It was stopped because ‚Äûis not easy to manage and may discourage people to join rakudo team‚Äú. Given tools like Github Actions might change this view.

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> https://wnpp.debian.net/?type%5B%5D=O&type%5B%5D=RFA&type%5B%5D=RFH&type%5B%5D=RFP&project=raku&description=&owner%5B%5D=yes&owner%5B%5D=no&col%5B%5D=dust&col%5B%5D=type&col%5B%5D=description&col%5B%5D=installs&col%5B%5D=owner&sort=installs%2Fdesc

[09:53] <habere-et-disper> nix package is somewhat stale too at six months old 

[09:54] <habere-et-disper> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-23.11/pkgs/development/interpreters/rakudo/default.nix#L30

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> I don't understand how that would discourage people to join the Rakudo team. That being said, it is better practice to package parts of a toolchain separately - if there is e.g. an issue with the nqp package, it can be reported against nqp specifically, the history can be viewed per package etc. It's a bit more time-consuming to manage, but with automation, that is negligible

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Anyway, I don't think this is the right channel for this topic, we are making noise for people that want to ask about the Raku language üôÇ I suggest moving into #general (don't see a better channel for the topic of packaging, maybe #ecosystem but not really)

[09:59] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> Oh that one is not bridged with IRC

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.shuppet> MoarVM is one month ahead (2023.09 vs 2023.08) for some reason. Don't know what the contribution process to Nix is, I guess we should just send a patch, it should be enough to only move the versions of rakudo + nqp + moarvm forward to 2024.03, like here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/e8d1a9c81d107cdc61219474597d3d62f0743755

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> (it failed only because the Discord runner has an old version where the sub forms of the mentioned stuff aren't available yet)

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> that's amazing, how did you come up with it

[11:49] <habere-et-disper> Learning by association... take the translations L10N file and put together what concepts/routines appear related and then follow the inspiration of the perl t-shirt.

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> very very cool stuff thanks for sharing

[12:05] <habere-et-disper> A new association was cache and sink. To hold onto something or to let it go -- a relatable somatic metaphor.

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <bobby_jim_birdrock> How do I match directly into variables?  I asked ChatGPT and the answer seemed incorrect (it didn't work).  I'd like to do this:  my $hex = "0810"; # for example my ($col, $row) = $hex ~~ /(\d\d)(\d\d)/;  But instead I seem to have to do something like this:  my ($col, $row) = (~$0, ~$1) if $hex ~~ /(\d\d)(\d\d)/;  I think I'm missing something so I thought I'd ask: am I missing something?

[16:09] *** vlad left
[16:20] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> What exactly did you ask? Which model?

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <bobby_jim_birdrock> Ah I guess a match object is returned.  So if I did this:  my $match = $hex ~~ /(\d\d)(\d\d);  Then ~$match[0] and ~$match[1] have the matched values.

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> you could use named captures https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Named_captures

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> another option is my ($col, $row) = ($hex ~~ /.../).list>>.Int to get a list of 2 Matches and ask them to be Integers
