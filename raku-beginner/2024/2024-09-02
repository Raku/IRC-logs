[05:27] <ab5tract> I wonder whether it is a REPL thing. I checked in RakuAST and it gave a more helpful exception:

[05:28] <ab5tract> m: q| unit sub MAIN (); CATCH { default { .payload.say } }; die "Dead";|.AST.EVAL

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @antononcube I am wondering if https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Markdown::Grammar would be a starting point for converting "Markdown-Obsidian-Flavour-With-Python-Code-Cells" into Jupyter-Notebooks. How shoudl I start?  Usecase: I did not find a way to convert a bunch of Obsidian-Markdown-flavour-files (containing Code and LaTeX) to Jupyter notebooks. When using pandoc, the code cells (three python ) are not recognized, also

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> jupytext is not supporting that Obsidian flavour format (as far as my reading took me).

[17:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Ideally my markdonw files are the "masters" and I generate the jupyter-notebooks out of them.

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz It is in my TODO list to implement a converter of Markdown to Jupyter in "Markdown::Grammar". Right now for that I use "jupytext".

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> If that converter is implemented in "Markdown::Grammar", then then the "main" grammar should be easy to specialize / subclass with the Obsidian flavour.

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I will experiment today to see how easy it is to make that Markdown-to-Jupyter converter.

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> This is the same reason I made "Markdown::Grammar", except my primary target is Mathematica notebooks.

[17:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, try to do the Markdown-to-Jupyter conversion with LLMs. See this example: https://youtu.be/kUCZspLHEiI

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz I made the first version of the Jupyter converter in "Markdown::Grammar". It is working on everything except LaTeX formulas. Hopefully, I will figure out the TeX/LaTeX code blocks today and push to raku.land.

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz The LaTeX "display" formulas are processed correctly. The "inlined" LaTeX formulas are just shown as code.

[20:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1280264347175616623/Markdown-Grammar-conversion-to-Jupyter-LaTeX-demo.png?ex=66d77296&is=66d62116&hm=29027356c08bd4f2843bcc266d4e156ae4d719318187dca4244a553b84749127&

[20:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I parse that kind of inlined expressions, but I have to figure out a nice to way interpret them in the Jupyter actions.

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ very nice

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> For this was the "biggest missing feature" in "Markdown::Grammar" for at least year. If I knew that I can implement it within a couple of hours, I would have done it 6-8 months ago.
