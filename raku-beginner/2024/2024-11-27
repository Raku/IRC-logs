[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Funny observation: ChatGPT 4o mini seems to include personal chat history in creating Code examples. When preparing generic, basic lecture material and I ask e.g. for the â€ždifference between Syntax and Semanticâ€œ I get examples in Raku instead of the expected Python. â€žBubbleficationâ€œ â€¦. ðŸ˜€

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> LOL: It explained â€žwhat Source Code isâ€œ to me by listing examples in Python, Raku and Java - so in my little world Raku is more significant the Java?

[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> seriousness off:  I conclude: a modern strategy for â€žmaking Raku more popularâ€œ is to make young people typing â€žRakuâ€œ in the prompts they use a few times. After that the term Raku will appear often in code examples. Perhaps there can be a lottery or something for that?  seriousness on

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... Maybe it is a "Raku LLM attack" -- to many Raku people ask syntax/semantic questions.

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz Do you have access to OpenAI's "reasoning" models "o1-preview" and "o1-mini"?

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> It is worth seeing what chatting with them brings using those questions.
