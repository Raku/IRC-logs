[07:10] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @antononcube ChatGPT never heard of the idea that too many people hate Perl. Whom can I trust? LOL    User Why was perl6 renamed to Raku? Why Raku?   ChatGPT The decision to rename Perl 6 to Raku was made to address confusion and to establish a clear identity for the language. Perl 6 had a long development history, and there was a desire to differentiate it from Perl 5 and to emphasize that it was a distinct

[07:10] <discord-raku-bot> language with its own unique features.  The name "Raku" was chosen after a comprehensive process that involved soliciting suggestions from the community and then selecting a name that was both unique and reflective of the language's character. "Raku" was chosen because it means "happy" or "comfortable" in Japanese, and the community felt that it represented the language's goals and philosophy well.  The renaming was

[07:10] <discord-raku-bot> officially announced in October 2019, and since then, the language has been referred to as Raku to avoid confusion with Perl 5 and to establish its own identity in the programming language landscape.

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> There is no contradiction — “too many people hating Perl” means “Perl is popular”, hence the need to avoid confusion, etc.

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m: dd (0...^5).max

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  4 

[11:26] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Two or three dots - interesting ....

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> m: say max(0..^5)

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  4 

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> and function or method makes a difference. Interesting.

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> m: say max 0..^5

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  4 

[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> it really is interesting
