[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <._taa_.> Hi. I am learning how to use modules in Raku. I am following the example on https://raku.guide#_using_modules. however, my code does not work as I expected.  I have done  zef install Digest::MD5 All candidates are currently installed No reason to proceed. Use --force-install to continue anyway   My code (same as the example in the guide) perl use Digest::MD5; my $password = "password123"; my $hashed-password

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> = Digest::MD5.new.md5_hex($password);  say $hashed-password;   Got:  You cannot create an instance of this type (Digest::MD5)   in method new at 'SETTING::'src/core.c/Mu.rakumod line 136   in block <unit> at D:\path\to\my\script\raku.raku line 3   Process finished with exit code 1   Where is the problem?

[15:59] <ab5tract> It appears to be an issue with your environment

[16:00] <ab5tract> Does ‘raku -MDigest::MD5 -e “say <success!>”’ work?

[16:01] <ab5tract> You might also need to close and reopen your terminal if you’ve just installed zef (just a wild guess, haven’t used Raku on Windows much)

[16:01] <ab5tract> Also, what does ‘zef locate Digest::MD5’ say?

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> fwiw i tried with 2023.09 on WSL and the same error appeared

[16:16] <ab5tract> Weird.. do other modules work?

[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> yes i tried to install another module and it worked

[16:31] <ab5tract> Thanks for checking!

[16:31] <ab5tract> https://github.com/hankache/rakuguide/issues/230

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> thanks for the issue

[16:32] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> author writes there "orphaned" and I understand that as they meaning https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5 <- this one is deserted

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> but when installing, zef says it installs that of grondilu: https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-raku

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> if i recall fine, there were some interesting things going on with this latter one

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i.e., module vs distribution stuff

[16:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i don't quite understand what is what there, nor if the issue author meant by "orphaned" that this latter module got into the umbrella of Digest

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i also tried "zef install Digest" btw, and it does the same thing with "zef install Digest::MD5" and the same error appears

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> so, i guess it's to do with the module but idk really

[16:35] <ab5tract> Also: https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5/issues/26

[16:37] <ab5tract> Ah, just saw your additions nahita

[16:38] <ab5tract> Looks like there is a long history of installation issues across both editions

[16:39] <ab5tract> It’s a shame it’s the example at Raku.guide :(

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <._taa_.> Thanks for investigating this.

[17:07] <ab5tract> no problem! literally any other module should work fine :)

[17:07] <ab5tract> `Digest::SHA256`, for example

[18:58] *** teatime left
[19:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> okaaay - Digest::MD5 is a bit of an issue ... TLDR;  go zef install 'Digest::MD5:ver<0.05>'

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that pins the version to the  https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5 variant (which works fine although abandoned)

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (fine on my mac, but there are some PRs (eg from JJ) to fix install issues that were never accepted)

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there is another module https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-raku that squats on all the various zef names Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA256, etc

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this is the one that fails -- very oddly it says Nb. Since commit 911c292688ad056a98285f7930297c5e1aea3bfb, there is no Digest module anymore, the submodules, Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1 and so on must be used directly.

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and when you go zef install Digest::MD5, you get ===> Staging Digest:ver<1.1.0>:auth<zef:grondilu> ===> Staging [OK] for Digest:ver<1.1.0>:auth<zef:grondilu> ===> Testing: Digest:ver<1.1.0>:auth<zef:grondilu> ===> Testing [OK] for Digest:ver<1.1.0>:auth<zef:grondilu> ===> Installing: Digest:ver<1.1.0>:auth<zef:grondilu>

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so zef is taking the request for Digest::MD5 and resolving it to the stated as abandoned Digest umbrella distribution that advises us to install the submodules directly (whatever that means) ... seems like a circular vortex of shit to me

[19:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tonyo: please can you take a look at this and maybe give us the best route forward (eg. adopt Digest::MD5 as a community module and uber-bump the version??)

[19:14] <ab5tract> that would be my suggestion too

[19:14] <ab5tract> librasteve++

[19:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [me I would just delete Digest from zef] ...

[20:05] <tonyo> is that on zef install?

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tonyo: yes

[20:07] <tonyo> can you post it in #raku and cc ugexe plz or make a ticket on the repo?

[20:07] <tonyo> i'm on my phone, haven't had a lot of time for raku lately dealing with health and va stuff

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sure

[20:14] <tonyo> tyvm

[20:29] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there are two issues, one on zef for your advice https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/558 and one on grondilu to fix the docs example https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-raku/issues/40
