[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz See "Markdown::Grammar:ver<0.5.9>" -- I uploaded it to raku.land. That version has a Markdown-to-Jupyter converter, which works with code and TeX/LaTeX. I have tried it only with my test Markdown files though. So, issues, suggestions, and PRs are welcome.

[09:01] <ab5tract> antononcube: I guess ConTeXt didn't end up fitting your needs?

[09:02] <ab5tract> it's got some significant advantages over LaTeX in terms of customization but of course that also adds to the complexity

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @antononcube Thanks. That was fast! I‘ll test it now.

[09:45] <ab5tract> Context also uses LuaTeX, which is opens up so many options

[09:46] <ab5tract> Anyway, probably the best way to show it off is to eventually submit a PR :)

[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract I did try to install ConTeXt after mentioned months ago without success.

[11:37] <ab5tract> Hmm. TeX can be a crapshoot of dependencies, but installing context from the context garden was always pretty straightforward for me in the past

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz There is a problem with the so called reference links. In Jupyter, it seems, that every markdown cell is “its own” Markdown document. I have a solution which I haven’t implemented for Jupyter yet. (Done so for HTML and Mathematica.)

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ab5tract Does any Jupyter kernel use ConTeXt? Is that any different than the usual TeX specs?

[11:50] <ab5tract> Its a set of modules for TeX

[11:50] <ab5tract> Same as what LaTeX is, from that perspective

[11:52] <ab5tract> I doubt any Jupyter kernel “uses” TeX in any capacity

[11:52] <ab5tract> Instead markdown is translated to LaTeX

[11:52] <ab5tract> If the kernel uses pandoc, Context is built in

[11:59] <ab5tract> Anyway, the distinction is that LaTeX has been stuck in an upgrade cycle for 10+ years as they try to address issues that prevent easy adjustment of layout / mixing of modules

[11:59] <ab5tract> Context has been through 2-3 versions in that time, with the same concerns but more effect outcomes

[11:59] <ab5tract> *effective

[12:00] <ab5tract> Maybe the LaTeX3 upgrade has been closer to 20 years at this point

[12:02] <ab5tract> I’m using the term “module” very loosely here. As in the TeX world the more accurate term would be “macro package”

[12:32] <ab5tract> https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/4987/why-should-i-be-interested-in-context

[12:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Good to know.

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I did think you mentioned ConTeXt in relation to Markdown-to-Jupyter converter.

[13:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @rcmlz Please use "Markdown::Grammar:ver<0.5.10>" -- it has the reference links working.

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> zef only gives 0.5.9

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> shall I use github as source?

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm.. I just uploaded 0.5.11 -- I will commit to GitHub within 5 min.

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> will switch to private chat as I  guess converting Markdown files to Jupyter Notebooks is perhaps poluting Raku Beginners Chat.

[14:28] <jaguart> Anyone have a working raku-tidy? I tried Perl6::Tidy but it no longer works - drforr we miss you

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I guess no relation what-so-ever with "tidyverse".
