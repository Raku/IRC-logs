[00:18] <ToddAndMargo> Windows 11 22H2.   RakudoΓäó v2022.07.    I am running a Raku  program I wrote as a "pre-event" program from Cobian Reflector.  Since I may have other Raku programs running, I need to know what started my program: console, Cobian, etc..   Does Raku have one of those fancy sysem variables that would tell me such?  Or some other way to

[00:18] <ToddAndMargo> find out?

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> maybe if you use $*IN for data transport you can ask, if it from a terminal: https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Handle#method_t

[08:43] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I recently had the problem that I wanted to know if a script was called with  data piped in, but could not distinguish inside the script between „cat gata.txt | script.raku” and just “script.raku”.

[09:10] <gfldex> If you need to know where a Raku program is run, you can always write something in $system-language and shell out to the tool.
