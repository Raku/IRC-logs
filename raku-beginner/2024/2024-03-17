[12:48] <habere-et-disper> In a method chain, does the hyper operator apply only to the next adjacent routine ?

[12:52] <lizmat> you mean >>.  ?  yes

[12:52] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2,3)>>.Int

[12:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar dc72fb765: OUTPUT: «(1, 2, 3)␤»

[12:52] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2,3)>>.Str

[12:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar dc72fb765: OUTPUT: «("1", "2", "3")␤»

[12:53] <lizmat> hmmm I'd thought that would generate a Seq actually

[12:55] <habere-et-disper> Yes

[12:56] <lizmat> it appears to generate a List...so indeed, only the adjacent routine, if I understand your question correctly

[12:57] <lizmat> note that it cannot be guaranteed that >>. will produce values in the same order
