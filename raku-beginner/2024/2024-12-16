[07:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> One way is to use single quotes. Another, is using a slash.

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> > What's not clear to me is why .function()(1,2) works the same way: wouldnt that call the field function with no args, then call that return value with two args? yes it would, as the other is doing, too; both $addition.function()(1, 2) and $addition.function.(1, 2) achieve exactly the same thing

[09:28] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> which thing is "call $addition.function with no arguments, then call whatever it returns with two arguments 1, 2"

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> if you didn't have the last "." in the second one, i.e., $addition.function(1, 2), this is now calling $addition.function with two arguments 1, 2

[09:30] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> (which may or may not work depending on the signature of &$addition.function, but let's assume it's nullary, so it would fail then)

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> there are 2 main things at play here: - when a function is mentioned, it's automatically called, no parens needed, e.g., sub fun { 7 }; say fun;  # says 7; no need for fun() - you can call a function with () or .(), because operators are functions in disguise  Now the people most often either do f or f(), but rarely f.(). But due to the 1st point, sometimes there is ambiguity, as in the example you gave

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> from the documentation; so .() is to the rescue.
