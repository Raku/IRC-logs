[18:45] <habere-et-disper> I seem to recall a raku advent calendar that was a PDF you could hang as a wall calendar ?

[18:45] <habere-et-disper> Am I imaging it ?

[18:47] <habere-et-disper> imaging => imagining

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You are right -- both PDF and HTML versions exist.

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/Calendar

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> The better one: https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Markup::Calendar

[19:01] <habere-et-disper> Is kv the only adverb that is also a method ?

[19:02] <lizmat> I would say "kv is the only adverb that is named the same as the associated method"

[19:03] <lizmat> k -> keys, p -> pairs, v -> values ?

[19:05] <habere-et-disper> Thanks for clarifying @lizmat. I stared too long at foo.bar.baz:kv before realizing I needed foo.bar.baz.kv

[19:09] <habere-et-disper> Can I get the magic of MAIN in non-MAIN subs?

[19:09] <lizmat> you mean, convert an array of strings to a Capture?

[19:11] <lizmat> if so, maybe https://raku.land/cpan:LEONT/Getopt::Long would be of help?
