[20:30] <ab5tract> I think itâ€™s a fair question, actually. I think if we chose to produce Ints from Int.comb, it would be a fairly reasonable choice. But it could also be considered too magical. I think the dealbreaker is Num.comb: would it produce Ints? What about the decimal point?

[20:32] <ab5tract> So the principal of least surprise actually errs on keeping it stringy here, despite it being somewhat surprising that Int.comb outputs Str

[20:32] <ab5tract> *principle

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> all questions are fair, but coming from the fact that The integer 123 in binary is 1111011. then the act of combing an Int means taking the decimal (?) digits one by one and then putting them in a Seq - so (even absent Num) 123.comb => (1,2,3).Seq is assuming a decimal representation of your Int and somehow taking each digit one by one. Since this is what .Str does for a living, I think that confining

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> .comb to coerce to Str() is a good design.

[20:39] <ab5tract> Did you see the part where I agree?

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh sorry - didn't mean to be critical (and my comment sure reads back that way) - I apologise

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> happy to agree
