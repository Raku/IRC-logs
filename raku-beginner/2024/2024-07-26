[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> What editor are most people using for raku?

[22:00] <lizmat> many use commaide.com

[22:07] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> Thanks

[22:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @briandouglas_71953 Depends for what. I write Raku package with Commaide. But this why to "heavy" and "involved". For simple scripts I use Visual Studio Code with Bscan's Raku extension. For research, I use Jupyter notebooks or chatbooks.

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> I'm enjoying writing beautiful code with Raku. I came across this which surprised me, whilst writing a DI container.       // Precedence issue with ! and :exists, perhaps you meant :!exists?     method set(Str $abstract, Callable $factory) {         if ! %!bindings{$abstract}:exists {             %!bindings{$abstract} = $factory;         }     }      // WORKS     method set(Str $abstract, Callable

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> $factory) {         if %!bindings{$abstract}:!exists {             %!bindings{$abstract} = $factory;         }     } 

[22:22] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> Nice error message btw

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Consider using LLMs with and for Raku.

[22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> I am, thanks

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <briandouglas_71953> I'd appreciate a code review as I'm a newbie, pointers are welcome.  Here is a DI container, without autowiring. I'll tackle reflection tomorrow.  https://gist.github.com/BrianDouglasIE/0b10304730ae87ecd4459e63213cff5e
