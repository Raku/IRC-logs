[08:31] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> hello all

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> im trying to run an example from the Gnome::Gtk for drawing Area and am not able to get it running

[08:36] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> <script src="https://gist.github.com/winfredraj/463aedef2068cd718f971b98708c8a70.js"></script>

[08:37] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/winfred/Code/Raku/Gnome/drawing_area.raku Invalid typename 'cairo_t' in parameter declaration. at /home/winfred/Code/Raku/Gnome/drawing_area.raku:7 ------>     cairo_t‚èè $cr-no, Gnome::Gtk3::DrawingArea :_widg

[08:38] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I have tried Gnome::Cairo::cairo_t as well

[08:40] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Can anyone help me here please?

[08:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lemme jump on my pc‚Ä¶ 5 mins

[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> thanks librasteve

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Happy Easter everyone!

[09:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok - i have coffee - lets take a look

[09:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://gist.github.com/winfredraj/463aedef2068cd718f971b98708c8a70

[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> brew install gtk+3

[09:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> meantime - don't you need a comma after cairo_t?

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> seems like the gist has some awkward line continuations - possibly with extra spaces?

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1223928131166146660/image.png?ex=661ba2e5&is=66092de5&hm=8f4e8e5fbc7fc35357e657d5e8661cf4c8a84354ef5d57ee383c59fbd222d1f0&

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> cairo_t seems to be the type of $cr-no

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> think I have GTK installed (phew!)

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please can you point me to the original example?

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> hold on

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> https://martimm.github.io/gnome-gtk3/content-docs/reference/Gtk3/DrawingArea.html#wow9

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks!

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I think here a colon is missing before _widget in the method callback type signature

[09:40] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I got another basic example working and I found it surprising snappy. I was expecting a very slow and laggy experience. It was a small window creation but I like what I could do a lot just with Raku code

[09:41] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> this would help me move over to Raku a lot more when I need GUI, right now I have to spin WPF with F# backends to get some basic GUI

[09:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar c7d24b3df: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[09:43] <habere-et-disper> Is this expected because we have sets of Int and sets of IntStr ?

[09:44] <habere-et-disper> I was expecting True for

[09:44] <habere-et-disper> m: say 4 (elem) <4 5>

[09:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar c7d24b3df: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> m: say 4 (elem)(4,5)

[09:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  True 

[09:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @winfredraj - please try cairo_bool_t instead https://github.com/MARTIMM/gnome-native/blob/main/lib/Gnome/N/GlibToRakuTypes.rakumod

[09:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> you mean cairo_bool_t $cr-no?

[09:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yep

[09:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (or maybe just delete the type)

[09:49] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I tried deleting the type already

[09:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> plus I guess you know that œÄ character was butchered by the gist

[09:49] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Unknown type Any used in native call. If you want to pass a struct, be sure to use the CStruct or CPPStruct representation. If you want to pass an array, be sure to use the CArray type.

[09:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ah - ok

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> using cairo_bool_t makes the errors go away, but I dont have any window popping up either

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> with my Gnome::Cairo $cr .= new(:native-object($cr-no))

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> well a different error is progress of a sort

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> $cr-no is used as a parameter for :native-object

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1223933011372933211/image.png?ex=661ba771&is=66093271&hm=929ba1756a898ac3ef4d4080795e303c5448c412d1970c5f3899b78919ad987a&

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> and native-object seems to have the type N-GObject

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> so this cairo_t or whatever type we use should match N-GObject at the end of the day

[10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @winfredraj - I am getting "kit" errors now on my mac ...

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  Cannot locate native library 'libgtk-3.so.0': dlopen(libgtk blah, blah 

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> In Linux we need to install libgtk-3-dev

[10:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - well brew has its limitations!

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tbh I am a bit out of my depth on the Gtk specific stuff - my best advice is to raise an issue over on the repo and see if you get any help from there ... https://github.com/MARTIMM/gnome-gtk3/issues

[10:10] <ab5tract> habere-et-disper: that is indeed a Int vs IntStr thing. because the types are different (or differ-Int ;), the (elem) call doesn't find the LHS

[10:10] <ab5tract> m: dd set <4 5>, 4

[10:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar c7d24b3df: OUTPUT: ¬´Set.new(4,IntStr.new(4, "4"),IntStr.new(5, "5"))‚ê§¬ª

[10:15] <ab5tract> winfredraj: how complicated is your GUI going to be? I ask because I've always found GTK::Simple to be much easier to use 

[10:16] <habere-et-disper> Thanks ab5tract -- Happy üê£

[10:16] <ab5tract> But if you need direct access to Cairo, martin's more comprehensive work is the only way to fly

[10:16] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Thanks librasteve

[10:18] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> @ab5tract - initially I need it for basic stuff, but if I am really going to do what I am planning to do, then I will need a comprehensive framework like WPF

[10:18] <ab5tract> got it

[10:18] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> so I wont have a lot of choice there

[10:20] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> thanks ab5tract, let me see if I can figure something out

[10:25] <ab5tract> from your gist I don't see a gui/window set up. maybe using an instance of Gnome::Gtk3::Main (https://martimm.github.io/gnome-gtk3/content-docs/reference/Gtk3/Main.html) will work as your :native-object argument?

[10:26] <ab5tract> habere-et-disper: Thanks! and right back at you\

[11:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  IntStr.new(4, "4") 

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> fwiw Set operations like (elem) use .WHICH to test sameness - so they are picky and look at value-types

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  Int|4 

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> m: say <4>.WHICH

[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Raku eval>  IntStr|Int|4|Str|4 

[11:35] <habere-et-disper> Thank you @librasteve :)

[11:35] <habere-et-disper> Why can I narrow a Num to an Int, but not an IntStr to an Int ?

[11:35] <habere-et-disper> m: say (3.0).narrow.WHICH

[11:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar c7d24b3df: OUTPUT: ¬´Int|3‚ê§¬ª

[11:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar c7d24b3df: OUTPUT: ¬´IntStr|Int|3|Str|3‚ê§¬ª

[11:36] <lizmat> "Returns the number converted to the narrowest type that can hold it without loss of precision"

[11:36] <lizmat> I guess can be interpreted as needing an IntStr to be converted to an Int

[11:45] <habere-et-disper> My internal working model of raku's magic is that more spicy magic is available behind quote words < > and ~~ and was surprised my dish needed more jalape√±os.

[12:05] <lizmat> habere-et-disper: I think it's just an oversight

[16:19] *** habere-et-disper joined
[16:20] <habere-et-disper> Should True and False be included with raku localization ?

[16:20] <habere-et-disper> https://github.com/Raku/L10N/tree/main/localizations

[16:22] <habere-et-disper> And what about "temp" ?

[17:04] <lizmat> habere-et-disper: please make an issue for that

[17:05] <habere-et-disper> (y)

[17:05] <lizmat> regarding True and False: handling enums in general is going to be tricky

[17:06] <lizmat> perhaps an exception can be made for True / False and probably Less / Same / More

[19:09] *** habere-et-disper left
[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> @librasteve and @ab5tract - got the Gtk example working! had to use Gnome::Cairo::Types to use cairo_t

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> that naturally only solved the error but to see it in action, I had to hook it up to a window and a grid like ab5tract had suggested

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1224082666236805160/image.png?ex=661c32d1&is=6609bdd1&hm=1af11a6feee69bfb615f3a869ad7b6c3ad96c005f8af8ffdd337ac2178a32539&

[19:47] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> thanks !!
