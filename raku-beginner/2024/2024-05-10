[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Hello, is there a standard way to create a package, like in Rust with cargo new? Also how can I install dependencies from raku.land? zef is giving 0 results for 6pm which is a valid pacakge https://raku.land/github:FCO/6pm

[13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @ay0ks You can use Comma IDE -- it has built-in wizzard for making new packages and apps. I recently used "App::Mi6" -- can be used from the command line. (And one can say it is a "lower level" package.)

[14:28] <ab5tract> ayOks: if you check the “auth” string for 6pm, it states “github:FCO”

[14:30] <ab5tract> And on the main page / search results you will see that the highlighted bar on the left of 6pm’s info block states “P6C”. zef only installs things that have a zef:* auth (AFAIK) and these candidates will have “zef” in the highlighted bar

[14:31] <ab5tract> For creating a new Raku module/distribution, App::Mi6 is indeed the gold standard

[14:47] <SmokeMachine> When I have some time I’ll migrate 6pm to fez…

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Conceptually that is strange: if testing a package fails, but the same package works perfectly fine when installed with „test ignorred“, something is fishy, either in the package or the tests of the package or in the tooling for testing.

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> On the windows problems. I was under the Impression that running WSL allows to access files on the windows file system from „inside“ WSL, not?

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> similar to Cygwing

[19:16] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Cygwin

[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Thanks @antononcube and @ab5tract

[19:50] <stanrifkin_> rcmlz: Is it not under "/mnt/c"?
