[20:29] <habere-et-disper> I can negate a character class with a minus prefix. This doesn't extend to Unicode properties or did I miss something ?

[20:30] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Can you give an example?

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> You can always use a conditional code block in the regex to check for are some conditions of the match are met. (Well, you most likely know that...)

[20:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Its negation is this: <:!property>. So, <:!Lu> matches a single character that is not an upper-case letter.

[20:37] <habere-et-disper> Thanks -- so it's a ! for Unicode properties and a - for a character class. =b

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ i got this from the docs, it seems that char class union with + and negation with - is common across both regular and unicode classes

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> /<:Zs + [\x9] - [\xA0] - [\x202F] >/ # Any character with "Zs" property, or a tab, but not a "no-break space" or "narrow no-break space"

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so maybe you can use '-' on unicode ones also ... but I haven't tried it
