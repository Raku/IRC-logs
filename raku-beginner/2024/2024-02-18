[01:13] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I just rebuilt a small example of Cro + Red as example for Cro-HTTP-Session-Red (https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red). I hope it can help...

[04:24] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine I'm looking at it, I was trying to separate the models into their own separate files but I'm running into errors

[04:34] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> for reference i'm trying to use this file in lib/Models/User.rakumod:   use v6.d; use Red:api<2>;  unit model User;  also is rw;  has Int $.id    is serial; has Str $.name  is column; has     @.posts is relationship( *.author-id, :model<Post> );  method active-posts { @!posts.grep: not *.deleted }

[15:59] <SmokeMachine> Shouldn’t you be referencing it as Models::User?

[15:59] *** MasterDuke left
[16:02] <SmokeMachine> Or at least `use Models::User`

[16:07] <SmokeMachine> And I suppose you will have the same e problem with Post… but you can add `:require<Models::Post>` on your relationship

[16:15] <SmokeMachine> If you are writing a blog, I have an example of a blog schema here: https://github.com/FCO/BlogSchema

[16:25] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm, I am writing 4 blogs, but in neither of them I use databases.

[17:23] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Does anyone has experience running Raku under Nix? I am having trouble installing LibraryMake with zef - an ld error I can not solve. https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-LibraryMake/issues/51

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> the problem is that i'm not able to reference either module in service.raku

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine

[19:19] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, what do you mean?

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Ok I'm doing a bit more debugging it looks like even if i do:  unit module Models::User;   model User is export is table<users> {   also is rw;    has Int $.id    is serial;   has Str $.name  is column;   has     @.posts is relationship( *.author-id, :model<Post> );    method active-posts { @!posts.grep: not *.deleted } }   add it to META6.json, and then reference it in lib/Models/Post.rakumod like this:   use v6.d; use

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> Red:api<2>; use Models::User;  unit module Models::Post;  model PostTag {...}  model Post is table<posts> is rw is export {   has Int      $.id        is serial;   has          $!author-id is referencing( *.id, :model<User> );   has Str      $.body      is column;   has          $.author    is relationship( *.author-id, :model<User> );   has PostTag  @.post-tags is relationship{ .post-id };   has Bool     $.deleted   is column = False;  

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> has DateTime $.created   is column .= now;    method tags { @.post-tags>>.tag } }  model Tag is table<tags> is export {   has Str $.name is id;   has PostTag @.post-tags is relationship{ .tag-id };    method posts { @.post-tags>>.post } }  model PostTag is table<post_tag> is export {   has UInt $.post-id is column{ :id, :references{ .id }, :model-name<Post> }   has Str  $.tag-id  is column{ :id, :references{ .id }, :model-name<Tag> }   has

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> Post $.post    is relationship{ .post-id };   has Tag  $.tag     is relationship{ .tag-id }; }   i get this error:

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768511641758466088/1208858707740332112/Screenshot_2024-02-18_at_2.32.12_PM.png?ex=65e4d067&is=65d25b67&hm=fee1432b4291af669fab12fd10e6c8730ab10dab385f2718b518553f00b998b1&

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> circular module error

[19:39] <SmokeMachine> Could you share the code/repo?

[19:41] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine https://github.com/arunvickram/begumpura

[19:44] <SmokeMachine> if you use User on Post and use Post on User it will be a loop...

[20:05] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I have a suggestion that works here: https://github.com/arunvickram/begumpura/pull/1

[20:06] <SmokeMachine> that's what I was trying to describe...

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine is the :require documented anywhere?

[20:13] <SmokeMachine> it should, but I'm not sure... let me take a look...

[20:18] *** MasterDuke joined
[20:19] <SmokeMachine> I think the only place it's mentioned is here: https://fco.github.io/Red/api/Red/Traits

[20:19] <SmokeMachine> I should doc that... would you like to help?

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Yea, in fact I can revamp the documentation site for Red to make it use Docusaurus or Astro: it'll look something like this: https://docusaurus.io/docs

[20:22] <SmokeMachine> but just to explain: if you do `:model<Bla>` it will try to use Bla, but you can change it doing `:model<Bla>, :require<Ble>` that will `use Ble` and use Bla as model...

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> so basically throwing use Model::User or use Model::Post at the top does nothing

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> ?

[20:26] <SmokeMachine> exactly... and doing that with `:model<...>, :require<...>` does that on runtime, so it will not loop...

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> about documentation, I like using Pod6

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i don't think that's mutually exclusive, you can use Pod6 to generate markdown right?

[20:35] <SmokeMachine> yes...

[20:37] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> More importantly, you can also use Markdown to generate Pod6.

[20:38] <SmokeMachine> that I wouldn't like...

[20:38] <SmokeMachine> I like to write Pod6

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Well, still the functionality exists. BTW, I use Pod6 while debugging the corresponding Markdown parser/interpreter.

[20:46] <SmokeMachine> but red tutorials are writen in md... https://github.com/FCO/Red/tree/master/docs/tutorials

[20:49] <SmokeMachine> and if interested, we also have a #red channel...

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> BTW, still cannot install "Red". I am kind of tired trying to chase all the dependencies and force installs.

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> At some point, I might submit a "make a Docker container/image" issue.

[20:53] <SmokeMachine> On Red repo there is a docket file for that

[20:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Yeah, I just saw that. Thanks!

[20:55] <SmokeMachine> 1 of them has no CMD

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine yea so what i was thinking is that you could write the docs in markdown which can be fed into docusaurus, I figured Red deserves a landing page unto itself

[20:59] <SmokeMachine> Currently we have this: https://fco.github.io/Red/

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'll get back to you with a revamped version of this this week

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> also @SmokeMachine also do i have to add every single file manually to META6.json?

[22:37] <SmokeMachine> I usually do (or use Mi6 that does this automatically to you)

[22:40] <SmokeMachine> https://raku.land/cpan:SKAJI/App::Mi6

[22:43] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> how would i use Mi6 to add files automatically for me?

[22:45] <SmokeMachine> Have you seen the report? (https://raku.land/cpan:SKAJI/App::Mi6)

[22:47] <SmokeMachine> When you run `mi6 build` it generates some files, including the META6.json

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> ahhh

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> yea i read that

[22:57] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i just wish that cro would automatically run mi6 build on refresh

[22:59] <SmokeMachine> While developing, I usually run Raku with `-Ilib` that ignores META6.json…

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> can you run cro with -Ilib?

[23:02] <SmokeMachine> raku -Ilib <path to cro> …

[23:10] <SmokeMachine> Did it work for you?

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> nope

[23:20] <SmokeMachine> What’s the problem?
