[14:23] <eiro> hello rakoons 

[14:24] <eiro> i'm a raku beginner since 2005 :)

[14:24] <eiro> what is the best way to scaffold a raku project nowadays ?

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @eiro Start using ChatGPT via Raku; install "Jupyter::Chatbook"; use the code generation prompt.

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My advice is biased.

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Otherwise, Comma IDE provides a fair amount of scaffolding functionalities.

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See: https://commaide.com

[14:40] <eiro> chatgpt :))

[14:41] <eiro> I will ask another way: is there a replacement for App::Mi6 or a zef create official subcommand ?

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> an official thing probably not

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm trying to resurrect Ddt as an App::Mi6 alternative but for some reason the original author never thought about having configuration so it's taking a while

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @eiro You could have asked ChatGPT your "different" question.

[14:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> also these days you could check if fez has some authoring features

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @eiro What do you want to use "App::Mi6" for? Can you formluate a few specs?

[14:49] <discord-raku-bot> <.vushu> fez to create and upload

[14:52] <eiro> fez? is there a fez command? (sorry for my rusty raku :))

[14:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Here is a screenshot show how ChatGPT can be used instead of "App::Mi6":

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "fez" is a command line tool. Install with "zef". (Get it?!)

[15:04] <eiro> I would like to use Cro as a replacement for a flask app (for raku newcommers who want to 

[15:05] <eiro> create a non-critical app)

[15:07] <eiro> thing is: if I help someone to try raku, I want to enforce best practices and packaging from the very beginning is a very good practice

[15:08] <eiro> but I have no other spec as I don't know about the recent evolutions of the raku ecosystem

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> if you know the historical background of Raku, you may also know that it doesn't have a culture of "best practices" for the most part

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I'm not saying it's necessarily a good thing

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Just to establish some sort of context

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Some of the largely uncontroversial best practices would be: using the extensions .raku, .rakumod and .rakutest respectively

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> using use v6.d on top of Raku files to ensure language version used for the script

[15:22] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> avoiding use lib as much as possible, favoring even the -I flag if needed

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> using the distribution structure one can see with zef, and releasing distributions using fez

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @nemokosch  > avoiding use lib as much as possible, I have seen this mentioned before. I follow it, but is there are more detailed discussion?

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> Probably there is, I would just check the rakudo and the doc issues and where it all leads to

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> ok, thanks!

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> Finally found a use in one of my projects for Raku grammars. It was super handy!

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> The problem was parsing the output of a pathing algorithm in a PL that didn't have a JSON output, and then visualizing that information on a grid
