[09:45] <dano> I can get file handles for files with open. Is there a similar file handle interface for STDOUT and STDERR? How can I get STDOUT as a file handle?

[09:59] <kjp> dano: $*IN, S*OUT and $*ERR start out connected to stdin, stdout and stderr, although it seems to be rather difficult to find documentation for them.

[17:41] <ACfromTX> Can someone point me to how to to change the default install directory for raku versions in rakubrew on Windows to something other than "c:\rakubrew" WITHOUT having to set --prefix each time?

[17:41] <ACfromTX> Thanks in advance!

[20:14] <gfldex> ACfromTX: If you move the install dir expect to hit the path length limits windows (foolishly) comes with.
