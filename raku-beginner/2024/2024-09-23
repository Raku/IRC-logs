[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <m_m3045> Does anyone have any success in building raku on RB3?

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> hello all, which packages do you use for plotting?

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Gnuplot examples are not seeming to work

[11:58] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/09/23/2024-39-fun-with-raku/

[13:22] <ab5tract> winfredaj: I seem to recall antononcube releasing some plotting module recently

[13:22] <ab5tract> Might be worth backtracking through some of the weeklies (

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj > hello all, which packages do you use for plotting? I use mainly these two packages: "JavaScript::D3" and "JavaScript::Google::Charts". Both generate JavaScript code for plots that can be rendered in Jupyter notebooks or HTML files.

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "JavaScript::D3" has more "features" it supports "Raku style" plot specifications.

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> "JavaScript::Google::Charts" is more rigid -- it interfaces to the pre-canned graphics routines of "GoogleCharts" and follows its style for plot routines names and arguments.

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> See the section "Design and philosophy" here : https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/JavaScript::Google::Charts

[13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> ill have to have a look in it

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My latest 6 Raku videos feature those packages: https://www.youtube.com/@AAA4prediction/videos

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Thanks Sir

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> Im installing JavaScript::D3 as we im typing

[13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> One of the problems with "JavaScript::D3" is that Jupyter can get "lazy" to render its code. Often, I have to close-&-reopen the notebooks a few times to get them rendered. Also, "JavaScript::D3" works in Jupyter notebooks run with VS Code; since â‰ˆ 1 year ago its code does render in "the browser." (Because of the "upgrade" or changes in the main Jupyter framework.)

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Making plots in standalone HTML files works fine, though.

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @winfredraj I am not sure has anyone tried those on Windows.  1) Do you use VS Code ? 2) Do you have "Jupyter::Kernel" or "Jupyter::Chatbook" installed?

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I usually work in WSL

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> But I also started again directly in Windows a few days ago, because Comma back in play

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I also program a lot in Android/Termux when I travelling

[14:09] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> And I travel a lot as I am a service engineer

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok. Do you use Raku in any REPL-like environment? (Again, like Jupyter.)

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> No, not really

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <winfredraj> I would like to as it would help in presenting data analysis to customers and colleagues

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Ok, these two videos show that: 1) "Geographics data in Raku demo", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkk_MeqLj_k , (37 min) 2) "Exploratory Data Analysis with Raku", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCnjMVSfT8w , (23 min)

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> @librasteve re: "Can Raku replace PHP" - This is horrible and I love it.

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <simona6822> hello i have a question! i'm working on a project for school and i need to make a poster with the most important updates for all relevant programming languages

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <simona6822> so my question is: what are the most important updates of raku?

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <simona6822> for now i have:  2020 Raku 2020 2021 Raku 2021 2022 Raku 2022 2023 Raku 2023 2024 Raku 2024 but i can't really decide which ones are the most important

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I had kinda hoped that this would NOT be picked up by the raku weekly due to the level of shame in writing something like this - however, my sense of -Ofun is somehow tickled and your [+|-]ve feedback has made me post it to HN - so that's now on you
