[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> is there a more compact way than <-[$]> to write 'any character other than $' in a regular expression?

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <timemelon> I'm doing quick and dirty grepping of delimited sections, and /\$<-[$]>+\$/ somehow feels like a lot

[16:52] <tea3po> I don't think so, although in Perl 5 it'd be /\$[^$]+\$/
