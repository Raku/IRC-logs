[14:57] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> arun: (i) what platform are you on? (ii) what code / commands did you try to get this error?

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I'm on Mac

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> me too

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> To generate the the project I ran cro stub http checkout checkout and said yes to all the options, to support http 1 and http 2 and websockets

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> and then i ran cro run

[15:07] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> that's it

[15:37] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve any thoughts on what it might be?

[15:38] <lizmat> And another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2024/02/05/2024-06-cropportunity/

[15:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have followed the chain to here https://github.com/jnthn/p6-io-socket-async-ssl/blob/master/lib/IO/Socket/Async/SSL.pm6

[15:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (line 500) and tried the README example in this repo (which gives the same error)

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> looks like this is the problem: https://github.com/jnthn/p6-io-socket-async-ssl/blob/7caec646f5ae5f6806ffb68f95fa30eaac1a0366/lib/IO/Socket/Async/SSL.pm6#L518-L520

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> this on eis above my pay grade ... please can you raise an issue on the Cro github and maybe echo it to the rak-irc channel for attention?

[15:42] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Which repo should I raise an issue at

[15:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> don't think it matters ...
