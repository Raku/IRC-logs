[05:48] <lucs> Is there an operator or routine that can give me the quotient and remainder of integer division?

[05:49] <lucs> my ($quot, $rest) = Foo(13, 5) # Would give (2, 3).

[05:53] <lucs> (I can use div and mod, I'm just lazy.)

[06:07] <lucs> Oh:

[06:07] <lucs> m: sub infix:<dm>(Int $num, Int $div) { return ($num div $div, $num mod $div) }; say 13 dm 5

[06:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0911eca22: OUTPUT: «(2 3)␤»

[06:07] <lucs> (but for some reason it kept failing in the REPL)
