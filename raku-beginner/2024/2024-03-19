[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> Oh, they dumped the repo

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> My commits are still here

[02:39] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> I can probably still do mac builds

[03:43] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> What can I add to this code so that every second, it prints "waiting…"?: loop { prompt "Press Enter…" }

[06:33] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i'm an asynchronous noob but I have found this:  Supply.interval(1, 1).tap(-> $count { say $count == 0 ?? "\nWaiting..." !! "Waiting..." }); loop {     prompt "Press Enter…" } 

[06:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> sources i) https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency#Supplies (where it mentions interval) and ii) https://docs.raku.org/type/Supply#method_interval (the documentation of the method itself)

[06:34] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> so what the code does is that, it schedules a Supply to fire at every 1 second (first argument) starting after 1 second of delay (second argument)

[06:35] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> i thought delay is reasonable not to say Waiting immediately after Press Enter

[06:36] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> documentation says the integer count (ticks) is passed on ("emitted") when tapped, i.e., $count will be 0, 1, 2... there

[06:37] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> so i'm exploiting that to print the very first Waiting message with a leading newline to make it not appear side by side to the Press Enter, if that makes sense

[06:46] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Thanks! You even included features that my actual code won't require (my question was a kind of "golfed" down version of what I'm actually trying to do), but I'll study it carefully.

[08:22] <lizmat> vendethiel is there a way the RSC can help you with keeping Comma alive?

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> lizmat: I think what the README says about turning it into a plugin first and foremost is true. Notarization requires an apple developer account, and that's pretty expensive (~100 euros a year or so?), plus it requires a mac.

[13:06] <lizmat> vendethiel I think such a project needs a project group and a fresh repo ?

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> (I'm not too knowledgeable about the platform underneath. Sena(/altai) usually made the platform upgrades, except for the mac stuff which I maintained separately because it was hacked together)

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> but that should allow ditching the intellij fork entirely

[13:08] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> though that may require fixing a few deprecations

[13:09] <lizmat> well, it is all above my paygrade, so I cannot contribute in any meaningful way at a technical level

[13:09] <discord-raku-bot> <vendethiel> also, merging community and complete since the difference doesn't make sense anymore

[13:09] <lizmat> so other people will need to pull the cart, so to say
