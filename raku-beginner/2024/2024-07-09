[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Question: Besides inheritance or roles is there a way to make large grammars composable so I can split different parts of the grammar into multiple files?

[21:36] <discord-raku-bot> <_grenzo> Or are roles the best way to do this?

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo Well, I do the latter for my DSLs/

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think this is one of the best, most unique features of Raku -- using OOP for grammars.

[21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Actually, I was wondering / experimenting last year using EBNF and Functional Parsers (FP) instead of grammars. (In Raku.) But I quit EBNF/FP after I saw Raku's handking of gramamrs.

[21:56] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @_grenzo I think a year or two ago I found this interview with D. Conway, where he discusses grammars and OOP: https://mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/11/09/episode-13-interview-with-damian-conway-designer-of-perl-6-programming-language/
