[11:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Is there an operator that combines leg  and  <=> ? Both of those return Less, Same, More  for strings and numbers respectively.

[11:01] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Of course, I can make such an operator, but there might a Raku feature that does that already.

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <nahita3882> cmp i think

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Thanks! (And I am surprised I did not look for cmp or found it quickly...)

[11:52] <lizmat> it's the default op for .sort  :-)

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @lizmat Makes sense!
