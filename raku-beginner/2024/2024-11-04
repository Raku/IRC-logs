[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> <.ohnowendigo> I have a list, like my $proc = <1 0 3>, and am trying to produce every possible list that can be made by subtracting 1 from any number of nonzero indices, like <0 0 3>, <1 0 2>, <0 0 2>. I have this code so far:       for $proc.grep(* > 0, :k).combinations(1..*) -> @x {       my $new = $proc.clone;       $new[@x]>>--;       @queue.push($new);     }   it works, but I don't like having to clone proc and

[20:09] <discord-raku-bot> then mutate the clone. Is there a way I can do this "purely"?

[22:38] <ab5tract> ohnowhendigo: Iâ€™m not sure I understand your requirements enough to help. But this seems like something you would normally do recursively if you are concerned about purity
