[12:33] <jaguart> .

[12:34] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart.v1> I see that the vscode extension prettier supports plugins based around an AST...

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @jaguart.v1 Do you mean bscan's Raku extension or a generic extension?

[13:00] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Hmm... I see you mean the extensoin named "prettier".

[13:00] <jaguart> I mean the extension called Prettier - has provision for adding plugins to tidy your code. The plugin arch is based on an AST parser and a printer

[13:00] <jaguart> yeah

[13:02] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I have not seen or heard about it before. I was thinking to try it out, but the reviews say it is too intrusive.

[13:03] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart.v1> I'm using the LANG server for syntax highlight and symbol nav - but vscode/lang-server code nav is meh in any case

[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <jaguart.v1> Do you mean Prettier? Yeah - it is opinionated, but as I mix and match a lot, I'm happy to go with a consistent opinionated  layout

[13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I do not like using VS Code at all, but I find it to be the best IDE for Jupyter notebooks with Raku or Python kernels.

[13:06] <jaguart> I used to have opinions in the old Perl days - but having moved around so much, and having slightly off-centre preferences, I am now just happy with consistency :joy:

[13:07] <jaguart> Honestly, VSCode is amazing and annoying at the same time. A case of complex is better - but I did a degree last year and they insisted so I've ended up persevering

[13:07] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Perl ü§Æ‚úùÔ∏èüí¶

[13:10] <jaguart> one nice thing that Perl now has is ``class MyClass { field $x; method y() {...} }`` - vs ``{ has $.x; method y() {...} }`` - its a smidge more consistent

[13:11] <jaguart> but lack of parallelism is a real drawback 

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Parallelism in Raku never worked for me as expected. Meaning, I never get a very minor speed-up for the algorithms I tried.

[13:12] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> But, it is good that parallelism is part of the language.

[13:12] <jaguart> I use ``race`` for multi-server devops ssh connections - it's a blast

[13:14] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Right, recently someone told me about converting many Markdown files in parallel. (With Raku's "Markdown::Grammar".)

[13:14] <jaguart> means that managing 20 servers in parallel is easy peasy - Perl does have IPC::Run which is great for forking but not so good for discovery-decide-execute which fits better into threading
