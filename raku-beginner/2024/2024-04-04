[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I just went sudo apt-get install rakudo on my ubuntu ... it installed 22.02 with no zef ... lack of zef is a big reason why older versions are a poor option ... also there is no reasonable way that 22.02, 22.12, or 23.10 are the best choice .... what is the policy here, will these be updated anytie soon (smalles of someone doing this on a one time basis and then not maintaining / running the build chain

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> )

[14:05] <xkoncek> if i understand correctly, current Rakudo does not expose any C API? i.e. there is no way to "run Raku from C code"?

[14:06] <xkoncek> similar to "lua_pcall"

[14:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> xkoncek: I think you can run a callback function via FFI

[14:06] <xkoncek> yes, i know that if possible, that's the other way around

[14:06] <xkoncek> *is

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66286010/whats-the-protocol-for-calling-raku-code-from-c-code

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^^ maybe this is helpful

[14:11] <xkoncek> next question: is there a nice way to execute a function / C function at the end of a raku script *implicitly*?

[14:11] <xkoncek> like a shutdown hook or something

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I suppose you could call the function from a LEAVE phaser in the MAIN block

[14:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and ENTER to run the set_callback stuff

[14:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [please note that the SO reply I linked has some older version of the nativecall library specifier per the note I just added]

[14:22] <xkoncek> what are phasers?

[14:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://docs.raku.org/language/phasers#LEAVE

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I guess Larry Wall (the creator or raku) was a star trek fan

[14:33] <xkoncek> i wrote some phasers at the top of a Raku script, but only the "unsuccessful" ones are executed, even when there is no other code in the script

[14:33] <xkoncek> UNDO is executed, KEEP is no

[14:33] <xkoncek> t

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://dev.to/lizmat/phasers-part-2-of-2-2o5e

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have just tried these example ^^ and they work fine

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  for 42, Nil {     KEEP { say "Keeping because of $_" }     UNDO { say "Undoing because of $_.raku()" }     $_;  # the return value of the block }

[14:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Keeping because of 42 Undoing because of Nil

[14:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ the default return value of a raku block is Nil ... so that's probably why you only see the UNDO

[14:55] <xkoncek> i mean i just wrote a script like this: `UNDO say "exit";`

[14:55] <xkoncek> at the global scope

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> that explains it

[14:58] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (the top scope of a script is an implicit block)
