[00:01] <SmokeMachine> what do you mean?

[00:06] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i think i get what you're saying in here https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15#issuecomment-473256864: even if we name migrations like B:from<1.0>:to<1.1> i don't think that does anything to help, that's what you're saying right?

[05:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> I have a question

[05:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> is there a way to make the refresh times on cro run any faster?

[05:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> the slowness is getting to me a little bit

[05:53] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it takes about 1-4 seconds after changing a file for me to be able to access the server again
