[17:53] <dano> Let's say I get a file handle with open, for example $handle = open "wut.txt";

[17:54] <dano> What is the way in Raku of closing that handle automatically as I leave the scope in which the handle was defined?

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <nemokosch> I wonder if there is such a way at all

[18:07] <gfldex> dano: Filehandles are closed during GC run. If you open loads of FH and need to close them quickly, a LEAVE-phaser might be in order.

[18:14] <dano> OK, thanks. I will need to read about phasers, haven't heard of them
