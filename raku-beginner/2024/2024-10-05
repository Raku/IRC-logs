[13:39] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dr.doom5771 I have not heard of "insta raku" (just "gangsta raku" ™️  by @grenzo).

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> @dr.doom5771 Do you try to compile and install Raku from sources? Or just install Raku?

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.doom5771> I was installing from source, it was rakudo

[13:46] <discord-raku-bot> <dr.doom5771> I don't see insta raku anywhere maybe it's a misunderstanding?

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> I think you wanted to write: > i am trying to install raku

[13:55] <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> My first thought was that there is a "insta raku" distribution or something... Then I figured out it is a misspelling.
