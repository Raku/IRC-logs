[07:55] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> @librasteve I red about HTMX and Cro and Raku. I was wondering why there is no mention of that in the HTML Examples section.   https://github.com/rajasegar/awesome-htmx?tab=readme-ov-file#examples-by-back-end  Did you consider adding one of your examples?

[07:57] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> or even here: https://htmx.org/server-examples/

[07:58] <SmokeMachine> romiz: I suppose because all that is very newâ€¦

[10:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> rcmlz: fantastic idea! SM is correct that today's advent post is right on the bleedin' edge - however, a couple of months ago I have rewritten all the https://htmx.org/examples in raku and Cro (with Cro Template Syntax) which you can enjoy here: https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples (main branch) - I like your idea and will propose sharing this to the sites you list - as we (?) bring in

[10:27] <discord-raku-bot> Fragments, Functional and Cromponents to the examples (Fragments is done, but waiting for the recent Cro::WebApp changes to be released by patrickbr)

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Out of curiosity: there is no such thing as CGI for Raku? So the â€žold-school-wayâ€œ of putting up a few lines of Perl cgi script onto a cheap webserver is not available for Raku?   https://examples.raku.org/categories/cookbook/19cgi-programming.html

[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> (besides the fact, that Raku is never global installed on these cheap web spaces)

[16:21] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> So for productive setup someone would use e.g. nginx to make the link between a Raku driven website (running Cro on localhost) and the outer world?

[16:24] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Or is this solved these days with the cloud-setup-never-fail-tools based on swarms of docker and stuff lije that?

[16:26] <lizmat> fwiw, irclogs.raku.org is using an nginx frontend and a Cro backend

[16:27] <lizmat> makes handling Let's Encrypt certificates a lot easier (and in line with the other sites I host)

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> but setup like this require a dedicated VM (managed manually) or is this all behind some cloud infrastructure management tools?

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i just built a raku-cro-nginx-letâ€™s encrypt on AWS EC2 ubuntu LTS â€¦ i would say that is standard and for my needs likely can share a server instance across multi cro and wordpress sites â€¦ did it use docker this time but docker compose is also a good path

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> rcmlz: itâ€™s been a while since i heard of cgi â€¦ i think the modern version of this is to have an http server handle request response (eg cro) on one or more routes and use eg nginx to integrate server routes on a machine

[16:37] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> So there is e.g. a â€ždeployâ€œ bash-script that takes a fresh VM and does all the setup - and databases or data files are on different host?

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/CLI::AWS::EC2-Simple will get you an empty raku docker ubuntu on ec2

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/CLI::Wordpress does what you describe for Wordpress on top of that

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Thank you. I have a clearer picture now about the technical setup of a Raku driven website might look like.

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> the build section here https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Cro-Website-Basic/blob/main/README.md#build is my manual steps to achieve basic install of cro (no db) â€¦ so itâ€™s on my radar to automate but i want to do a production build first to uncover any wrinkles

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also there are good instructions on the raku cro docs for how to do this with docker (and kubernetes i suppose) which i will try to follow also

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh and somewhere i am planning to bring Red and mysql onboard

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> btw i would love any feedback / collaboration / feature requests at https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Cro-Website-Basic please note itâ€™s all quite experimental atm

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> &afk

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> I am all-in on â€žexperimentalâ€œ :-)  Recently I got interested in Nix (and guix) because I work in a BYOD environment and desperately want â€žreproduceabilityâ€œ on my own and on the computers of all students - and automate any setup fully. Maybe I manage at some point how to package rakudo-star for Nix packages, which could be extended in your direction. But there is not much time for that â€žinterestâ€œ atm

[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Bring Your Own Drugs?

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> So my long term goal would be to have for each programming or research project a default.nix that does all the needed things and make it â€žworkâ€œ - including Jupyter and perhaps stuff like Cro etc.

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> Device ðŸ¤“

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> Oh, okay. Probably better ðŸ™‚

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <rcmlz> And atomatically setting up Rakudo, Cro, Red, MySQL, ngingx etc. on a local VM via Nix should be not much different from doing the same on a VM somewhere else.

[17:09] <SmokeMachine> Red has no MySql driver yetâ€¦ :(

[17:12] <SmokeMachine> Thatâ€™s probably the next thing I should tackleâ€¦ I have startedâ€¦ but not there yet: https://github.com/FCO/Red-Driver-MySQL

[17:13] <SmokeMachine> If anyone would like to helpâ€¦
