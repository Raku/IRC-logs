[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Hello, I have the following slang, how can I make it define a package-level variable on usage? perl my role Debug::Grammar {     rule package_declarator:sym<LOGGER> {         <sym> <block>     } }  my role Debug::Actions {     method package_declarator:sym<LOGGER>(Mu $/) {         # EVAL q {         #   use Pretty::Debug;         #   our $LOGGER = Logger.new();         # }     } }  use Slangify Debug::Grammar,

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> Debug::Actions;  perl LOGGER {}; # Should define $LOGGER  I couldn't find any extended documentation or a tutorial covering edge cases, this is the only problem I'm facing while learning Raku.

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Thanks in advance

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Also I would be veeery grateful if anyone can recommend a book/referemce or something that really documents the language, not like the superficial think https://docs.raku.org is

[18:19] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> thing*

[18:36] <ab5tract> Think in Raku is very good

[18:36] <ab5tract> sorry, it's just Think Raku - https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/907

[18:37] <ab5tract> but honestly docs.raku.org is a generally quite comprehensive best effort of the community

[18:38] <ab5tract> if you find something lacking, issues can be create at the github repo - https://github.com/Raku/doc

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> I just need some documentation for this

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Think Raku only has 2 occurences of the word slang

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Thanks anyways

[19:10] <lizmat> ayoks perhaps https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Slangify and its reverse dependencies can serve as inspiration

[19:13] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Already checked all of them, no one is doing what I want

[19:14] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> I tried using EVAL, tried doing it with QAst but that didn't work either

[19:16] <lizmat> do you have a description of what you want it to do ?

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Maybe codeblocks aren't showing in IRC.  my role Debug::Grammar {     rule package_declarator:sym<LOGGER> {         <sym> <block>     } }  my role Debug::Actions {     method package_declarator:sym<LOGGER>(Mu $/) {         # Gives an error:         # EVAL q {         #   use Pretty::Debug;         #   our $LOGGER = Logger.new();         # }     } }  use Slangify Debug::Grammar, Debug::Actions;

[19:18] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> I'm trying to make it define a variable at package level on declaration  LOGGER {};

[19:29] <lizmat> please use some kind of pastebin for code (e.g. gist.github.com)

[19:30] <ab5tract> you said "documents the language", not "documents Slangify" or "documents slangs"

[19:31] <ab5tract> both of those are less covered, that's true

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Slangify is just a wrapper, slangs are part of the language and should be documented, roughly docs.raku.org just says Slangs are slangs

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> One moment

[19:33] <lizmat> problem is that slangs are really bleeding edge, and don't really have a stable API yet.  the Slangify module is an attempt at creating a stable API

[20:27] <lizmat> ayoks what's Pretty::Debug?   What's Logger ??

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @ay0ks - here is a very nice example of a working raku slang ... https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Slang-Roman/blob/main/lib/Slang/Roman.rakumod ... it makes sense to me because I can see the intent in lines 138,139 ... sorry, but I cannot understand (i) what you are trying to do and (ii) how close you are to the Slangify model. if you wouldn't mind making a gist with a minimal example of the

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> expected inputs and outputs of your new grammar that would be very helpful

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> I updated the gist https://gist.github.com/ay0ks/e567e9906f7b47939515dbeecbf90fe4

[21:34] <discord-raku-bot> <ay0ks> Also thanks for the example
