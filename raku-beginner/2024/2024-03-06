[20:44] <Guest30> New to writing my own modules and I can't get a simple test to work after reading

[20:44] <Guest30> docs.raku.org/language/modules. Do I have to use something like zef to create/install my own modules? Can I not just put the code somewhere raku use Foo; will find it?

[20:46] <Guest30> Oops. Wrong link. Should be docs.raku.org/language/module-packages
