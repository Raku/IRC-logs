[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how would you handle the union of disjoint intervals (I guess this has some mathematical term as well)?

[10:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if there is some unwrapping mechanism in sets, that's already a plus

[10:42] <lizmat> m: dd ^10 .Set

[10:42] <lizmat> is that what you mean?
