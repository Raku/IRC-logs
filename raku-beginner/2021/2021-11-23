[00:18] <Guest495> Hi everyone! :)  How do I turn this around:

[00:19] <Guest495> m: say ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'].sort: *.chars;

[00:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: OUTPUT: «(an test length amazing)␤»

[00:19] <Guest495> I thought this would work:

[00:19] <Guest495> say sort(*.chars): ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'];

[00:19] <Guest495> m: say sort(*.chars): ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'];

[00:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar cf1ee490c: OUTPUT: «Ambiguous call to 'sort(WhateverCode)'; these signatures all match:␤  (&by, +values)␤  (+values)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Hello

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> first of all, you need to know that routines and mathods are still different things

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> first of all, you need to know that routines and methods are still different things

[08:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so actually there is no guarantee you can "turn around" everything

[08:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> second, it seems to me that sort does "exist globally" (maybe because it's a multi-method, I'm not sure)

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I think your syntax is invalid, plain and siple

[08:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but I think your syntax is invalid, plain and simple

[08:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: say sort(*.chars, ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test']);

[08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the colon plays the role of the paranthesis

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in the first case, you had only one argument so it was equivalent to [].sort(*chars)

[08:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in the second case, though, you have two

[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the colon is for disambiguation when you want to drop the parantheses; it's used for method calls

[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> here you could just drop the parantheses

[08:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: say sort *.chars, ['an', 'amazing', 'length', 'test'];
