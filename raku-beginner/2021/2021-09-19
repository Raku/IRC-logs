[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> It's not that the for loop is async, it's just that the loop is setting up some async stuff

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> `.tap` returns immediately but sets up some code to run whenever something comes down the Supply

[16:32] <colemanx> Is there a sigil and twigil suitable for printing? I'd like to print it out and stick it on my wall :)

[16:32] <colemanx> a sigil and twigil cheatsheet, i mean

[16:34] <lizmat> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/mu/master/docs/Perl6/Cheatsheet/cheatsheet.txt  perhaps ?

[16:34] <colemanx> This looks perfect, thanks

[16:35] <colemanx> Comes out to exactly one page it seems! :)

[16:35] <lizmat> yeah, it has been tweaked for that

[16:36] <lizmat> mind you, it has some parts that are NYI, such as some of the SCOPE DECLARATORS

[16:37] <colemanx> NYI?

[16:37] <lizmat> Not Yet Implemented

[16:37] <lizmat> and it misses things like the set operators, react / whenever. supply

[16:37] <lizmat> but it's a good start :-)

[16:37] <colemanx> Well, it's a start

[16:38] <colemanx> thanks a bundle

[16:38] <lizmat> yw

[17:29] <colemanx> An edit: IRC link in the cheetsheet needs to be updated to Libera

[17:30] <lizmat> colemanx: good catch

[17:35] <lizmat> fixed with  https://github.com/Raku/mu/commit/f95bcf3377

[21:56] <zacts> I <3 cheatsheets

[21:56] <zacts> I have one for awk as well

[21:56] <zacts> I think they're increadibly useful
