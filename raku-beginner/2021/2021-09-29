[14:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Assume that 1) I execute a script multiple times without changing it, and 2) the script starts with a call to `srand` , say  `srand(332)` . Does 2) guarantee that the subsequent calls of random commands in the script (using `roll`, `pick`, or  `rand`) and Hash-objects creation commands would produce the same results during each execution of the script?

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I strongly suspect that Hash-objects creation is not influenced by `srand`.
