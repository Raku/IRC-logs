[23:23] <Flwyd> Grammar docs say that `token` ignores whitespace. I'm not sure what's meant by that.  Playing with the `grammar REST` example I haven't been able to parse a path like `/ foo / bar / baz` with spaces, even if I change the `token` definitions to be something like `{ \w \w+ }` or `{ < [ ! @ # $ % ^ ]>+ }` and trying to match `'/foo/bar/! @ #'`.

[23:59] <Flwyd> And https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars makes it seem that rules but not tokens ignore whitespace, so maybe https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial is just misleading?
