[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> @Coke gotcha -- thank you everybody! -- it is all clear to me now ðŸ™‚

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> how do we write something like this? ```raku

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> my @arr = <

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> file1

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> file2

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> file3

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> file4

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> >;

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> sub get-lines($fname) {

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209>   $fname.IO.lines.elems

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> }

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> my @counts = @arr>>.get-lines;

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> say @counts;

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> ```

[02:10] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> basically, what i mean to do is apply some function as a transformation to each member of the array

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> until now, i have been writing a "do for"

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> ie,```

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> my @counts = do for @arr {

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209>   get-lines($_)

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> };

[02:12] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> ```

[02:13] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> i have a feeling there is a shorthand for this -- does anybody know what it is?

[02:17] <A26F64> Would `@arr.map({ get-lines($_) });` not be appropriate?

[02:36] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> thanks, it is definitely an upgrade --  there is something in the back of my mind i think i have seen somewhere which is one line, may use >> and does not explicitly need $_

[02:39] <[Coke]> @arr.map(*.get-lines)

[02:39] <[Coke]> slightly shorter; uses a whatevercode instead of a block.

[02:39] <[Coke]> afk

[02:47] <A26F64> That's very clean but it fails for me as `get-lines` is not a method of Str.  `@arr.map(*.IO.lines.elems)` should work (but that's not calling an independent function as requested).

[03:33] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> Something like `@arr.>>&get-lines` ?

[03:34] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> Something like `@arr>>.&get-lines` ?

[03:36] <A26F64> And by which means `@arr.map(*.&get-lines)` also works.

[03:44] <A26F64> (Though the hyper operators are not strictly equivalent to ordinary `.map` as "all hyper operators are candidates for parallelism".)

[06:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> you shouldn't need the `WhateverCode` in this case: `@arr.map(&get-lines)`

[07:35] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> oh nice! thanks everybody for the answers.  i'll be able to use bits and pieces of your replies for lots of new code (to be written) ðŸ™‚

[07:35] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> !!! i think the syntax i had in the back of my mind used the &

[07:36] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> i think the syntax i had in the back of my mind used the ampersand! that, i think, is the cleanest way

[07:36] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> but the whatever code inside the map is also a great trick i didn't know

[07:36] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> you folks are the best ðŸ™‚

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> i love that i can use this syntax with [+] to reduce the array

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> ie ``` say [+] @arr>>.&get-lines;```

[07:40] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> brilliant syntax.  raku is the best.

[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono#1716> Hello.

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono#1716> Is there any information related to how the grammars work

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono#1716> Ah nvm I found the page for them.
