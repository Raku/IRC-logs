[00:02] <colemanx> I am getting an error, this class method is not found: https://github.com/dontlaugh/App-Kubedee/blob/main/bin/kubedee.raku#L31

[00:03] <colemanx> specifically "No such method 'from-args' for invocant of type 'App::Kubedee'"

[00:04] <colemanx> here is my class... or what I'm hoping is a class https://github.com/dontlaugh/App-Kubedee/blob/main/lib/App/Kubedee.rakumod

[00:04] <colemanx> Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

[00:33] <gfldex> colemanx: did you try `is export`?

[00:34] <colemanx> That doesn't work if I put if I do `unit class App::Kubedee is export;`

[00:36] <colemanx> .new works, so it seems like the class itself is visible from my script in bin/

[00:36] <colemanx> but of course you get a .new by default

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> is it possible to make a reverse polish notation operator with subroutine? for example ```

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> 324 43 $@%

[14:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> ``` gives me `324 + 43` which would be `367`

[14:48] <lizmat> m: sub rp(\a, \b, \op) { ::("&infix:<" ~ op ~ ">")(a,b) }; say rp 42, 137, "+"   # the closest that comes to mind

[14:52] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> as far as I can tell, this is impossible with a postfix operator, but you could make `rp <1 3 5 + ->` work for example

[14:54] <lizmat> yup, you could  :-)
