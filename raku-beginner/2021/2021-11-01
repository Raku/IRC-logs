[01:26] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @lakmatiol#8020 `$/` and thus `$0` are not automatically populated within a regex. They come to existence in any block or outside the regex. You can force that by having a block inside the regex.

[01:28] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say '12345671' ~~ / $<ref> = [ . ** 1 ] .+ $<ref> /;

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say '123456712' ~~ / $<ref> = [ . ** 2 ] .+ $<ref> /;

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> Also, your example is wrong. :)

[09:14] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @lakmatiol#8020 Because the contained block forces `$/` to be set.

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> @gfldex#8222 hi

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> i want to use a predicate on a for loop

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> for (1..7) but only the even numbers

[09:23] <lizmat> for 2,4...6   # note the ... dots instead of ..

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> m: for (2,4..6) { $_.say }

[09:24] <lizmat> m: for 2,4...10 { .say }

[09:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 580b3ba79: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§4‚ê§6‚ê§8‚ê§10‚ê§¬ª

[09:25] <lizmat> *must* use 3 dots, not 2

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> m: for (2,4...6) { .say }

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <gabriel80546#9187> thank you very much
