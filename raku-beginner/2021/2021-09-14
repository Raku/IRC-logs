[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> is there a way go from <a b c d> to `(<0 a>, <1 b>, <2 c>, <3 d>)`

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> .kv seems correct, but it doesn't group them and grouping them manually seems counterproductive

[17:08] <lizmat> ^Inf Z <a b c d>  

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> oh, that's clever

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> thanks
