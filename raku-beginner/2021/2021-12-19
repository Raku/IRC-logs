[12:04] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> is there an equivalent to ruby's `5.times` where is does something based on an int count?

[12:05] <lizmat> for ^5

[12:05] <lizmat> say "foo" for ^5

[12:05] <lizmat> m: say "foo" for ^5

[12:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar b5fb3628b: OUTPUT: «foo␤foo␤foo␤foo␤foo␤»

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> ah, keep forgetting that way

[12:06] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> thanks

[12:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this 5.times stuff came up a couple of days ago

[12:25] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> I remember this, but couldnt find it, ill try and search

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> right same solution

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> I guess the next thing would be is what is `^5`, is it a range?

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> yup

[12:31] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> it's a shorthand for `0..^5`

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> raku ranges are inclusive by default, you can use `^` to exclude that bounhd

[12:32] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> raku ranges are inclusive by default, you can use `^` to exclude that bound

[12:33] <discord-raku-bot> <shift-eleven#8115> ah gotcha
