[03:35] <mfiano> Hi again

[03:36] <mfiano> I haven't given up completely yet, as it was mentioned I might be able to use raw FFI calls.

[03:36] <mfiano> (see #raku discussion yesterday)

[03:38] <mfiano> I am currently wondering what the majority of people are using Raku for these days. Historically Perl has been mostly used for text processing and cgi scripts (which I suppose is a subset of the former). I am told Raku is more suitable to other tasks, and while I know it is a general-purpose language, I'm still curious what most people use it for these days.

[06:48] <gfldex> I mostly use it to blog about. :)

[06:48] <gfldex> And shell scripting.
