[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hello, I have the following task

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I have two ordered files with lines of data, I need to compare them

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> What I did the last time with Python was taking an iterator for both sides of the comparison and call next depending on the current positions, so much like a merge

[15:52] <lizmat> what should be the outcome of the comparison?  a Bool ?

[15:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it should show the differences at least

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> at the end of the day, the lines will have a key-value structure and there will be 4 different outcomes for each row: a) only left b) only right c) complete match d) different value to the key

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> we don't care about c) but the rest is needed

[16:28] <lizmat> is the order important ?

[16:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not really; the only important thing is that we shouldn't detect matchable rows as extra rows

[16:37] *** dakkar left
[16:37] <lizmat> what about duplicates ?

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> There will be no duplicates

[16:45] <lizmat> make a hash of the lines in the first file, check the lines of the second file with that hash

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Isn't that a bit costly when I have a 5 digit number of "records"?

[20:07] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> lines() is lazy, maybe that would get you what you need to mimic the python solution?

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that's what I'm going to try

[20:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I was curious whether I miss something obvious
