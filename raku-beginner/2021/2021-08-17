[19:15] <neither> hi, hi! I have a numeric variable how can I check if it's an integer? For example the result of a square root operation. I'm doing `Int($v) == $v`, is this prefferable in the language? I looked at the documentation and find `is-int` method but it says it's for Range objects

[19:17] <neither> To make it not an XY problem I'm checking if a number is a square like 196

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:say (1, 1/1, 1.1, 2)».Rat».&{ .denominator == 1 };

[19:27] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say (1, 1/1, 1.1, 2)».Rat».&{ .denominator == 1 };

[19:29] <gfldex> neither: it depends if you want to check for some typed that type checks against Int or if you are looking for a test that does Numeric

[19:29] <gfldex> if you start with a string, you can use a Regex ofc.

[19:32] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say 'eval bot test';

[19:33] <neither> gfldex I don't understand your first message but thanks for denominator and regex ideas.

[19:37] <gfldex> If you got a float that is really close to an integer, things might get hairy.

[19:38] <neither> oh yeah

[19:38] <neither> m: say 4.0000000000000001e0 == 4

[19:39] <gfldex> The eval bot is running on the Discord side in this channel.

[19:39] <neither> (i thought this is evaluated in here sorry.)

[19:39] <gfldex> I should be able to fix this tho.
