[19:19] <colemanx> I'm building my first module :) It's going to be an executable, with a private lib. Do I use the App:: prefix?

[19:19] <colemanx> in my META6.json

[19:22] <colemanx> Here is my repo https://github.com/dontlaugh/kubedee

[19:22] <colemanx> I am converting an all-bash tool to Raku. I emailed the original author, and he has discontinued development. But I use this tool

[19:23] <colemanx> So I figured converting the bash script and .lib side-by-side to Raku will be a good exercise.

[19:23] <colemanx> And if you use K8s and LXD this tool is cool

[19:30] <lizmat> yeah, the App:: prefix is generally used for such a thing, see e.g. App::mi6 which installs an "mi6" CLI

[19:30] <lizmat> App::Mi6 actually  :-)

[19:33] <colemanx> I installed mi6 and it looks like what i've put up so far builds successfully

[19:34] <colemanx> it created a lib/.precomp directory. should I gitignore this?

[19:38] <lizmat> yeah, that's probably wise

[19:39] <lizmat> App::Mi6 does it by default,  (for a mi6 new Foo::Bar)

[19:42] <colemanx> gotcha. I think I'm good to go. Here's the interface I'm converting. https://github.com/dontlaugh/kubedee/blob/main/bin/kubedee.raku

[19:42] <colemanx> I might start with wrapping the bash directly, so I can make incremental progress

[19:44] <colemanx> Thanks again, as always!

[19:45] <colemanx> I will solicit review when I have something substantial

[23:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hello, how do I match all characters but '-' in regex?

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> apparently /<-[-]>/ does the trick... not gonna lie, it's a bit Brainfuck-ish
