[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> hello! This is day 1 of Raku for me.  I'm running the interactive shell (Built on MoarVM version 2021.09) and I'm wondering if there's anything like "help" I can call.

[17:48] <lizmat> andrew.solomon: what would expect "help" to say ?

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> well, I'd start with something like 

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ```

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> help(1);

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ```

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> In the hope that I would understand what the `perl` method is for. ie.

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ```

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> 1.perl;

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ```

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> For context - this is where I found it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function#In_Raku

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: sub help { say 'https://docs.raku.org/language.html' }; help;

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> I guess we could wire `rakudoc` into `help` in the REPL.

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ok, so the question I should have asked... what's the `perl` method for?

[19:02] <discord-raku-bot> <andrew.solomon#4672> ok, so the question I should have asked... what does the `perl` method do?

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> I am pretty sure it's an older variant of the `.raku` method, which returns an expression which would evaluate to a given object when possible

[19:47] <[Coke]> m: say (3+2).raku

[19:47] <[Coke]> ... there's no bot here, oops.

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> m: say (3+2).raku
