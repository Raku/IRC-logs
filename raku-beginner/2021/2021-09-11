[11:14] <hamza79> Hey

[11:16] <hamza79> I am interested in Raku. How is it as Functional programming language coming from Haskell, ML and Lisp

[13:40] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> pointfree composition is a lot less common, and I would suggest against recursion for most operations, but just about everything is an expression, and you get first class functions and metaprogramming. No linked lists either.

[13:41] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> the type system is surprisingly powerful, but closer to CL (though unlike CL checkable at compile time to some extent0 than haskell/ML

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <unixcat64#4715> Hi all. Is there a Raku version of Perl's IPC::Cmd?

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <unixcat64#4715> Or a Raku way of doing the same things?

[17:10] <lizmat> there's of course Inline::Perl5

[17:11] <lizmat> but I'm unsure of the semantics of IPC::Cmd: possbly Proc::Async (in core) does all the necessary stuff for you already ?

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <unixcat64#4715> thank you lizmat, I'll check it out

[20:51] <discord-raku-bot> <unixcat64#4715> is there a Raku/Perl6 language server?

[20:53] <discord-raku-bot> <unixcat64#4715> I haven't found one via Google

[21:02] <[Coke]> What do you mean "language server"?

[21:02] <[Coke]> website where you can run code interactively?

[21:12] <[Coke]> if so, https://raku.org/resources/, look for "Practice Online"
