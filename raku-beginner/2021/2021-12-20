[18:59] <lizmat> and yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2021/12/20/2021-51-transiting/

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I see Raku also has Promises and they have a nicer interface than in JS

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Is there a way to get "coordinates" from a nested array?

[21:05] <lizmat> you mean: given a value from a nested array, what it's indexes are ?

[21:06] <lizmat> *its

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well, that would also be cool

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but right now, I was thinking of: given a nested array, what are the "keys" of it

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @Nemokosch#9980 you may be looking for this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4469

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> To be precise, the `@array[**]:deepkv` candidate.

[21:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> woah
