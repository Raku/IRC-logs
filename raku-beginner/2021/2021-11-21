[05:29] <CIAvash> Flwyd: No, tokens ignore whitespace, where does it say that rules do so?

[05:29] <Flwyd> The grammar tutorial.  I filed https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3985 with details.

[05:30] <CIAvash> And by whitespace docs mean the whitespace in grammar, not the text that is going to be parsed

[05:31] <Flwyd> Yeah, I realized that's what was confusing me.  I suggested a clarification in the issue above.
