[16:51] <coleman-x> Is there any limitation - in principle - to what a Raku grammar can parse?

[16:51] <coleman-x> My understanding is that Raku itself can be parsed with a Raku grammar.

[16:51] <coleman-x> Is that true?

[16:58] <lizmat> yes, that's how the Rakudo is set up, yes

[17:34] <coleman-x> amazing :)
