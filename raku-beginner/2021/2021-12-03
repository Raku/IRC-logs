[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Well, what are the possibilities?

[08:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It would be cool to match based on the key

[08:25] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> I can think of `p ~~ {.k ~~ sth}`but there may be a better way

[08:25] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> oh it isn't .k

[08:26] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> I can think of `p ~~ {.key ~~ sth}`but there may be a better way

[08:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```

[08:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > :6a ~~ ('a' => Any)

[08:27] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> True

[12:14] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @Nemokosch#9980 In the end a `Pair` is just a very small `Hash`.

[12:14] <lizmat> m: dd (a => 42).kv

[12:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar bbdc5fb7e: OUTPUT: ¬´("a", 42).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I could ask the same for hashes as well

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> for lists, something like this seems to work:

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> <a 34> ~~ ['a', *]

[12:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: dd <a 34> ~~ ['a', *]

[12:15] <lizmat> yeah, smartmatching two lists will smartmatch corresponding elements

[12:16] <lizmat> and short-circuit as soon as one fails

[12:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is there anything like this for hashes?

[12:16] <lizmat> I think it will smartmatch the pairs, which will smartmatch key and value ?

[12:18] <lizmat> it may shortcut on number of elems in both cases

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why is

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: dd :2f ~~ :2b

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> True

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> my %h = :a1, :b2, :c3;

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> my $p = :a1;

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> say %h.keys ~~ $p.key;

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> even this is unintuitive

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> let alone this, this is madness

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> my %h = :a1;

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> my $p = :a1;

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> say %h.keys ~~ $p.key;

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[12:21] <lizmat> hmm... looks like Pair.ACCEPTS only looks at value

[12:23] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> What does roast say to that?

[12:25] <lizmat> one would have to look  :-)

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is there a way to add multiple arrays value by value?

[12:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> seems like something for hyper

[12:51] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^5; my @b = |@a, |@a, |@a; say @b

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> Smartmatch on `Pair` might just look at keys because a key can be of any type.
