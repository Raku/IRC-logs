[13:43] <whaaat> is anyone available who can help me get started?

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is your programming background?

[13:59] <whaaat> I have an associate's in computer programming

[13:59] <whaaat> pretty rusty though

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean it makes a difference whether it's a first language for you or it isn't

[14:03] <whaaat> it's not a first language

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> For me, it helps when I have some little tasks to solve and try to just look for it in the raku docs or google

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if you don't have ideas, https://theweeklychallenge.org/ can help

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Rosetta Code too

[14:06] <whaaat> thanks
