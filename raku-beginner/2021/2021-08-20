[21:05] <neither> hi, hi! Is there a way I can pass operator by its name or sub form to hyper metaoperator?

[21:06] <neither> So that `@arr >>&infix:<~>>>"N"` or similar works?

[21:07] <neither> I have the infix operator in a variable

[21:27] <neither> Wrapping it with square brackets seem to work!
