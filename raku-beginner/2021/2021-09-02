[18:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hello, what's the idiomatic way to count the occurences of a certain character in Raku?

[18:56] <lizmat> m: dd ("foo" ~~ m:g/o/).elems   # would be a way

[19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say + "banana".indices('a');

[19:54] <lizmat> gfldex++

[19:54] <lizmat> forgot all about indices  :-)
