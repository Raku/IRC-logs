[21:16] <[Coke]> are the dupes coming from the discord bot itself or the users?

[21:17] <lizmat> gfldex might know

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> Maybe how edits are sent to irc?

[21:18] <gfldex> Those dupes can be caused by edits of already posted lines.

[21:18] <gfldex> I don't really have a sound solution.

[21:20] <[Coke]> ah, I didn't noticed the last one was different.

[21:21] <lizmat> gfldex: don't the lines have some kind of ID that you could use to .squish on ?

[21:22] <gfldex> That would require to delay forwarding a message. How long shoult it wait? Edits can happen hours later.

[21:23] <lizmat> no I mean, don't send edits ?

[21:23] <lizmat> but yeah, I see your point

[21:23] * lizmat goes afk&

[21:24] <gfldex> That could cause confusion because the IRC side can refer to a message that doesn't quite exist on the discord side.

[21:27] <[Coke]> maybe tag the message with [EDIT]?

[21:27] <[Coke]> but edits seems a perfectably good reason to send near-dupes. no worries

[21:28] <gfldex> No reason not to give it a try.
