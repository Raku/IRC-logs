[13:59] <[Coke]> Do you prefer books, online resources, interactive testing...

[13:59] <[Coke]> https://raku.org/resources/ - "for newcomers

[14:00] <DuckBill> I used to do some programming in Perl 4 & know what Perl 5 is

[14:01] <DuckBill> Yes to online resources, Sure Why not? to interactive testing

[14:02] <[Coke]> You may be interested in https://docs.raku.org/language.html - look for "Perl to Raku" for a few articles.

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @DuckBill Do you have any specific problem area in mind? I think it helps to learn Raku in that way. I personally chose Raku three years ago because of its great way of specifying, programming, and managing parsing with grammars and corresponding interpretations. 

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> 1) Because of this I read book by Moritz, "Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars: A Recursive Descent into Parsing". 

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> 2) Then I much of Foy's book "Learning Perl 6: Keeping the Easy, Hard, and Impossible Within Reach". Right now, I often read chapters of JJ Merelo's book "Raku Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach". And of course I read/browse https://docs.raku.org all the time.

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @DuckBill " I used to do some programming in Perl 4 & know what Perl 5 is" -- sorry, I missed that statement. It is very likely my book path above is not applicable to you...
