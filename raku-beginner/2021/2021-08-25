[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Sky#0464> in https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Identity_matrix#Raku `[1, |(0 xx $n-1)], *.rotate(-1) ... *[*-1]` is used to generate an identity matrix, how does `*[*-1]` work here? I thought the `*` at end meant infinity in ranges and sequences, and last element of infinity doesn't make much sense...

[14:02] <lizmat> * is more about "Whatever" generally, than Infinity

[14:03] <lizmat> if something is bound in some other way, then * just indicates to what it is bound, and [*-1] then indicates the last element

[14:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Sky#0464> in that case `*[*-1]` is basically a function returning the last element?

[14:04] <lizmat> yes

[14:05] <lizmat> say *[*-1]( (1,2,3) )   # 3

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Sky#0464> okay, https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_... says "If the endpoint is not *, it's smartmatched against each generated element and the sequence is terminated when the smartmatch succeeded. The final element is excluded of the sequence if a sequence operator variant with a final caret is used, it is included otherwise.". so, the last element is being treated as a boolean here, and the list stops

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Sky#0464> makes a lot more sense, thanks!

[14:10] <lizmat> yw!
