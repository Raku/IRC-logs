[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Is it possible to "reload" a package in a Raku session? (For example, I have a new version of the package I want to use but I do not want to quit the session.)

[15:55] <lizmat> I don't think so, currently

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat Ok, good to know.

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Is there an opposite of `pairup`? Some function converts a pair into a list or slip.

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> kv?

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Hmm... yeah. I think I tried that ...

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and? ðŸ˜„

[16:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I also tried that and it does that

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Ok. This is the data structure I have:

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> ```

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> $obj=$["2" => {"NChars.elems" => 9185, "NChars.max" => 695, "NChars.mean" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => <48533/835>, "NChars.median" => 50.0, "NChars.min" => 1, \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.sd" => 47.15582900463849e0}, "6" => {"NChars.elems" => 6467, \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.max" => 413, "NChars.mean" => <388109/6467>, "NChars.median" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => 52.0, "NChars.min" => 1, "NChars.sd" => 47.11089565189994e0}, "7" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => {"NChars.elems" => 6356, "NChars.max" => 539, "NChars.mean" => \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <56209/908>, "NChars.median" => 52.0, "NChars.min" => 1, "NChars.sd" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => 51.88168307308139e0}, "1" => {"NChars.elems" => 8047, "NChars.max" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => 450, "NChars.mean" => <475485/8047>, "NChars.median" => 50.0, \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.min" => 1, "NChars.sd" => 49.588402810696e0}, "3" => \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> {"NChars.elems" => 7457, "NChars.max" => 434, "NChars.mean" => \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <447425/7457>, "NChars.median" => 53.0, "NChars.min" => 1, \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.sd" => 46.58161354817983e0}, "4" => {"NChars.elems" => 8493, \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.max" => 545, "NChars.mean" => <500896/8493>, "NChars.median" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => 52.0, "NChars.min" => 1, "NChars.sd" => 46.53129096684931e0}, "5" \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> => {"NChars.elems" => 8450, "NChars.max" => 453, "NChars.mean" => \

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "NChars.sd" => 47.972282676556034e0}]

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> ```

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "list of pairs" is not really an established data structure imo

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Map is

[16:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> The commands `$obj.kv` does not produce a list of lists for me.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so you could convert to Map

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or just map to kv

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's also a question if you want the output to be flat or not

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Map.kv produces flat output

[16:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you map your list with &kv, that will produce nested output

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yeah, what you suggest works, but I have to add `.rotor(2)`. Meaning: `$obj4.Map.kv.rotor(2)` .

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> But, instead I can "just" write `â€Œâ€Œ$obj4.map({ ($_.key, $_.value) })`   -- that is what what I was doing up to now. I am not sure which of the two options is better. The second seems more obvious to me. (For now...)

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> .map(*.kv) ?

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or even .map(&kv)

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296>  That last on is good -- but breaks my ZMQ connections!! ðŸ˜¡ Thanks!

[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296>  That last one is good -- but breaks my ZMQ connections!! ðŸ˜¡ Thanks!

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is ZMQ again, good sir?

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> See https://zeromq.org -- I use ZMQ to connect Raku to Mathematica and vice versa. (Same with Jupyter.)

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> No, ZMQ breaking was caused by something else. Meaning, all your suggestions work for me.

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ðŸ¥³
