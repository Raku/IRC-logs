[00:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Anyone know of good ways of representing programs/program transformation?

[01:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Also raku seems perilously complicated

[08:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> can i always check if a Seq is infinite, or is it sometimes not possible?

[08:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> `(1...False).is-lazy;  # False`

[08:24] <dakkar> I feel that "seq is infinite" reduces to the halting problem

[08:24] <lizmat> indeed

[08:25] <lizmat> really, marking an iterator as "lazy" makes sure that it will fail on something like .join without just trying to join the universe

[08:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> :p thanks

[22:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Soo what's the best pitch for raku? It seems like there's a steep learning curve

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> What doesnâ€™t have a steep leaning curve?

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> Playing guitar well does too. Takes a few years and lots of practice.

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> Or you can just learn a few chords and still do some pretty cool stuff.

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Right but with guitars you can make music, I'm asking what's special about raku that justifies the learning curve

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> but what I'm saying is there really isn't much of a learning curve if your needs are simple.

[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> you can learn a few chords on the guitar and play some pretty decent music, but not be an expert
