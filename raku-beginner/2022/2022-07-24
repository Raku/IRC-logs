[02:32] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> How do I clear the REPL?

[06:26] *** saint- left
[06:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I generally just make a call to shell

[06:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> qx{clear}

[06:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I guess on windows it would be cls instead of clear?

[07:15] <deadmarshal> right on windows it's "cls"

[08:27] *** jaguart joined
[08:28] <jaguart> lizmat++ thanks :)

[08:41] <jaguart> A question on old habits - and Raku optimisation - do Raku folks always use '' when there is no interpolation, or do ya'all just "" and leave it to the optimiser?

[09:04] <jaguart> I kind of hate pod6 :( - I write lots of comments, and use them to help me visually navigate my code. Trying to do this using pod6 does my head in

[09:06] <jaguart> Basic things, like #| on successive lines should just be one declarator block for the following code...

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I'm on Windows. `qx{cls}` doesn't clear it. It just re-prompts. I'm using Powershell with Windows Terminal.

[09:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, then whatever it is called in powershell, lol

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> It is `cls` in Powershell but it has no effect in the REPL.

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure why anyone would use Raku on Windows tbh

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> because I use Windows

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> WSL

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> no thanks

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> well the REPL should not prefer one OS over another

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a developer should, however

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> but I'm not

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> then again, not sure why want to clear the REPL, lol

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> it's messy

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or why you are using terminal (let alone on Windows) in the first place

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> after a bunch of experimental statements

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> why are you questioning what I'm using?

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> because it's not suited for what you want to do

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> am I committing a sin?

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is it not obvious

[09:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> jeez

[09:14] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> you must be a very proud guy

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> thanks for the assumptions I guess

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> thanks for blaming random guy's choice of OS

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> almighty person

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you may call it blaming, I just said it's not suited for the goddamn thing you want to do

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> yeah so Raku isn't suitable on Windows you've said that like 3 times already at least

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it would be more beneficial to evaluate whether this is true or not

[09:15] <jaguart> aris - are you trying to reset your REPL session or clear the screen?

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> amazing of you to say that

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> that's right

[09:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> pretty sure this was an either-or question

[09:17] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I'd like to clear the REPL screen <@853712446660673566>

[09:20] <jaguart> I dont have your setup to test - does qx{dir} etc work?

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> let me try

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> it works

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> but not qx{cls}

[09:21] <jaguart> try qx{clear}

[09:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> error

[09:22] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> because it's not a powershell command

[09:22] <jaguart> hmmm - clear works in my PowerShell

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Look, I might have found something but again, cannot promise that it works in a terminal running powershell...

[09:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> have you installed Linenoise of all REPL modules?

[09:24] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I'm on 5.1 not powershell core btw

[09:24] <jaguart> $PSVersionTable -> mine shows PSVersion 5.1

[09:24] <jaguart> and both cls and clear are aliases to Clear-Host

[09:25] <jaguart> qx{Clear-Host} maybe?

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> <@426689195076091905> i use `run "clear" andthen "".say`

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> yeah clear works actually on my powershell 5.1 but qx{clear} throws an error

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in Linenoise, supposedly ctrl+L would clear the screen

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> ```'clear' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> operable program or batch file.```

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> let me c

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> error

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> ```'Clear-Host' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

[09:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> operable program or batch file.```

[09:26] <jaguart> Do they work in just PowerShell outside the REPL?

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> no biggie I'll just experiment by running a script

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> clear works outside REPL

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> Clear-Host works too

[09:27] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> outside REPL

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i wrapped this in a function in a module

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> ```

[09:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> sub was is export {

[09:33] <jaguart> I assume that `run 'clear';` doesn't work any better than `qx{clear}?`

[09:34] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[09:36] <jaguart> and `shell( 'clear' )`

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> np; interesting...

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> side question: does invocation of `raku` to open the REPL starts using a lot of CPU for you as well? I witness this in a long-standing program as well (e.g., a GTK3 application). It uses ~16% CPU when even Chrome uses no more than 2% :p

[09:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> it wouldn't matter for me but the computer starts making sounds, so i notice :p

[09:36] <jaguart> aris: see https://docs.raku.org/language/independent-routines#sub_shell

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> then i write `was` to clear

[09:37] <jaguart> which indicated that on windows the system shell defaults to %*ENV<ComSpec>

[09:37] <jaguart> so if you `say %*ENV<ComSpec>` you should see which shell the REPL is running - might not be powershell?

[09:38] <jaguart> hmm - `run` doesnt use the shell... 

[09:46] <jaguart> Heres the powershell tty clear sequence: echo "$([char]27)c"

[09:46] <jaguart> so you might just be able to say this to clear the screen

[09:47] <jaguart> bbl

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> yeah it's running cmd (DOS) even though I executed the REPL from Powershell

[09:52] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> weird

[09:57] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> that's why the error messages said "batch file" in them

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> once again: can you install the Linenoise module?

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> yeah my cpu usage jumps by 5% when I execute REPL in Powershell

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> 4 of my CPU cores are constantly active while REPL is running

[11:39] <lizmat> 4 ??

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> yup

[11:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Quibono> Does raku have TCO?

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I just tried printing that escape sequence and I got `Unable to initialize device PRN`.

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I found `qx{powershell cls}` works but it’s obviously overkill

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I found `qx{powershell cls}` works but it’s obviously overkilled

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Somehow everybody seems to miss the fact that Linenoise apparently supports clearing the console by the Ctrl+L combination

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Does it work on Windows? I have no idea but it's not obvious why it wouldn't, at least

[12:09] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> `print "\033[1H\033[1J"` also gives me the same error message

[12:10] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I've also tried that in `cmd` (i.e. outside REPL)

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> `.say for flat ($(24, 7),)` prints `(24, 7)`; however, `.say for flat $(24, 7)` prints 24, newline, 7; why is it flattening in this latter case?

[15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Because of the additional containerization in `($(24, 7),)`. This has been discussed in StackExchange -- let me find the link...

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> yes; despite that containerization, it flattens...

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> in the latter case, i mean

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> See : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41648119/how-can-i-completely-flatten-a-list-of-lists-of-lists

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> isn't there that containerization, too?

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> isn't there containerization, too?

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> My rationale is that `$(24 ,7)`  is thing that `flat` detects to be a list and makes it a `Seq` object; `($(24, 7), )` is a list of things, and `flat` makes a  `Seq` object of that list.

[15:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am not sure if summary / rational that helps -- if its is a summary it all...

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am not sure if that summary / rationale helps -- if its is a summary it all...

[15:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i see, thanks...

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> i found this https://design.raku.org/S07.html#Iterable

[15:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > Note that flat respects Scalar containers, and so:

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > 

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> >     for flat $(1, 2) { }

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > 

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> > Will only do one iteration.

[15:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> but it does 2 iterations, and that's my confusion.

[15:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think the docs are outdated on this one, and the described behavior doesn't sound too reasonable, either

[15:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> My rationale is that `$(24 ,7)`  is a thing that `flat` detects to be a list and makes it a `Seq` object; `($(24, 7), )` is a list of things, and `flat` makes a  `Seq` object of that list.

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> docs still say containerization is respected

[15:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't read it that way

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am not sure if that summary / rationale helps -- if its is a summary at all...

[16:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "Interprets the invocant as a list (...)" now, what is $(1, 2) as a list?

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Also, multi flat(Iterable \a)

[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It drops the container right away

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't feel safe without trying this...

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: dd $(1, 2).list

[16:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well, there you go

[16:07] *** ab5tract joined
[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> does it though

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> ```py

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> >>> sub f(Iterable \a) { say a.raku }

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> &f

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> $(24, 7)

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> ```

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well, sigilless variables do not have containers

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> At the same time, the docs also say that sigilless parameters always bind

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> See, that's why I said that I wouldn't feel safe without checking the .list method 😂

[16:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> It won't matter

[16:16] *** guifa left
[16:18] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Sigilless symbols don't have containers created automatically. They can very well be bound to one.

[16:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> How can check or verify that a sub is defined? With `&some-func.defined`  I get `True` if `some-func` is defined, but otherwise I get the error message "Undeclared routine:...".

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> find-method?

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> ^find_method, that is...

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> `\o33[1H\o33[1J` doesn't look right...

[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> or rather it's overcomplicating things

[16:38] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> <@694526400488669234> you have to do a runtime resolution for the symbol, match against Routine. Routine will always return True on .define, so that is redundant.

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> powershell has *some* capacity for ansi, just i need to rebuild to test

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Maybe dynamic linking can be troublesome though

[16:41] *** jaguart joined
[16:43] <ab5tract> Regarding the runtime resolution of the symbol, you would look into the current package scope to check whether the name is defined and whether it is a Routine

[16:45] <ab5tract> That said, it sounds a bit like an X-Y problem.. unless you are doing some fairly nasty evals, you should be able to know whether a sub is in scope or not

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> in the meantine, have some chad newlines

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> weird

[22:05] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I finally figured it out. In cmd, to insert the escape character, press `Ctrl+[`. So, to clear the REPL, run `qx{^[[H^[[J}`, where each `^[` represents the escape character entered by pressing `Ctrl+[`.

[22:06] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> Thanks <@210313526928080896> for the help.

[22:17] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I finally figured it out. In Powershell and cmd, to insert the escape character, press `Ctrl+[`. So, to clear the REPL, run `qx{echo ^[[H^[[J}`, where each `^[` represents the escape character entered by pressing `Ctrl+[`.

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> It's still a mystery though why the escape sequence works but `qx{cls}` doesn't.

[22:21] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> `say ^[[H^[[J` works too... (again, `^[` aren't literal characters but they represent the escape character entered with `Ctrl` + `[`)

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> I finally figured it out. In Powershell and cmd, to insert the escape character, press `Ctrl` + `[`. So, to clear the REPL, run `qx{echo ^[[H^[[J}`, where each `^[` represents the escape character entered by pressing `Ctrl` + `[`.

[22:32] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> `say "\e[H\e[J"` works too

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <aris> which is much better than pressing `Ctrl` + `[`
