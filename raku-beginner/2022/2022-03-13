[06:16] <CIAvash> stevied: why not do `$dom_post.find('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6').map: {  S/\+.*// given .text }`?

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I haven't tried the syntax. Not used to it. It's hard to get out of the "for loop for everything" habit. and it turns out I have to get the child node of the dom object (which is a text node) to make any changes to the content. That was my biggest problem. Thanks for the suggestion though. The more I see code written this way, I'll pick it up.

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so it was a combination of me not being familiar enough with the module and just being a bit clueless about syntax.
