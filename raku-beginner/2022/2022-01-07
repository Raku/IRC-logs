[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> I have a question regarding doctest in Raku.

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> I was wondering if there is something similar to Python's "doctest" also available in Raku? The idea is to have some (happy-pass)-test/examples directly attached to the sub, serving the purpose of documentation and automated testing simultaniously.

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> I know I can use 

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> #| ( some documentation attached to e.g. a sub starting on next line that is shown when &fun_name.WHY is called) 

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> to attach documentation in front of a sub. Is there a way to run the examples in this #|() special comment? Like in the example shown in the screen-shot?

[12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <RoM#5135> Thank you for your thoughts on that.

[18:19] <SmokeMachine> RoM#5135: I was playing something like that: https://github.com/FCO/Pod-Test-Code

[18:22] <SmokeMachine> It will test your podâ€™s code blocks

[20:38] <guifa> SmokeMachine nice

[20:41] <guifa> Something that approaches it a bit differently would be Test::Inline https://github.com/alabamenhu/TestInline

[23:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can someone help me understand why I might want to use p5built-ins?

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> particularly, functions like `chomp` or `chop` which are already in the raku language
