[07:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well the bridge does work so I see no reason why you couldn't see it

[07:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I only tend to join from the IRC side when I want to execute some code, besides that, it only has obvious drawbacks compared to discord

[07:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean, when I join from this kiwi client, I see no previous messages, literally

[09:18] <CIAvash> Well I prefer Matrix+Element and there is no problem with executing code with IRC bridge

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> On Discord, there is, just like apparently there is with the messages as well

[10:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's just I use discord and I see no advantage of using the IRC other than reaching out to you guys

[10:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this is coupled with a good set of disadvantages

[10:05] <CIAvash> I don't use IRC directly either, I'm talking from Matrix

[10:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Apparently there is a discord bridge for Matrix üòõ
