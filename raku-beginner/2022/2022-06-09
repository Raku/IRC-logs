[01:20] <discord-raku-bot> <klebs#2209> do you anticipate this improving? what would it take to improve? which parts of the compiler are the bottleneck?

[13:11] <jgaz> I'm trying to read a binary file one byte at a time. I've read https://docs.raku.org/routine/read and friends and I'm sill confused. I can get slurp to work, but I end up with an array of one element: a buffer the length of the file. How do I read one line at a time or split a buffer? Either approach should owrk.

[13:18] *** archenoth joined
[13:26] <lizmat> jgaz: reading one byte at a time / one line at a time?   feels like conflicting requirements?

[13:26] <jgaz> one single byte: it's a binary file.

[13:28] <jgaz> I haven't tested it yet, but I think I found some example code I can work from: https://github.com/Michael-S/raku_trivial_io_benchmark/blob/master/read_single_byte.raku

[13:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I know a hash can be converted into an array of pairs by assignment. For example, `my $hp = %h`. Where is this described in the documentation? Maybe it under a certain "general principle" page?

[13:40] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: your example just puts the Hash object into a scalar

[13:40] <lizmat> m: my %h = :42a; my $h = %h; dd $h; $h<a> = 666; dd %h

[13:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: ¬´Hash $h = ${:a(42)}‚ê§Hash %h = {:a(666)}‚ê§¬ª

[13:40] <lizmat> m: my %h = :42a, :666b; my @a = %h; dd @a   # assigning to an array will give you Pairs

[13:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar bb9447237: OUTPUT: ¬´Array @a = [:b(666), :a(42)]‚ê§¬ª

[13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Thanks! Yes, I mistyped, I meant to write  `my @hp = %h`.

[13:44] <lizmat> the reason for that behaviour is that you get Pairs when you iterate over an Array

[13:44] <lizmat> s/Array/Hash

[13:44] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[13:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Again thanks!

[16:49] <jgaz> How do I coerce a Buf[unit8] into an Int? Using the +prefix listed in https://raku.guide/#_common_operators isn't doing the trick.

[16:53] <gfldex> jgaz: sounds like a job for https://docs.raku.org/type/Buf#(Blob)_method_unpack

[16:54] <jgaz> gfldex: okay, is it still considered experemental in 2022.02?

[16:57] <gfldex> It is.

[16:57] <jgaz> k

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> jgaz: `$buffer[0]` works as it seems

[16:59] <jgaz> That works!

[16:59] <jgaz> Nahita: thank you!

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> it depends

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> that'll work for buffers of one element, but if there are more, are you sure you want the head, or does the tail make more sense? given a big `Int`, i'd do the whole `$buffer` as a reduction, but whether or not it needs to be `reverse`d depends on where it should start

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> (they mentioned they were reading data one byte at a time, so that was why the suggestion)

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> oh

[17:56] <jgaz> Yeah, true. I'm trying to write a simple disassembler. All I need is one byte at a time; it's an 8-bitter.

[17:57] <jgaz> It's a LO,HI arch, so I'll have to swap the occasional word... not a big deal.

[17:57] <jgaz> Most ops only take an 8 bit operand, occasionally they take two for absolute addressing.

[17:59] <jgaz> swap the occasional bit pair, I mean, so I can decode the occasional 16-bit word.

[17:59] <jgaz> byte pair

[17:59] <jgaz> time for more coffee.

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone using command here know how to immediately run the file active in the window without adding it to the "Run configuration?"

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone using Comma here know how to immediately run the file active in the window without adding it to the "Run configuration?"

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm on a mac

[19:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I tried contol-option-r but that does just opens the run configuration window

[19:39] <lizmat> sorry, Comma supporter but not Comma user

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, np. just a minor annoyance

[19:49] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@563790557831495691> you might find help at info@commaide.com

[19:53] <MasterDuke> or in #cro, a bunch of the comma devs also hang out there

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks. haven't had any luck with the info@ email in the past

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> is that #cro in freenode?

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> found a #cro room in libranet. only two people there

[20:02] <MasterDuke> hm. could also try #moarvm, they're usually there also

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@563790557831495691> The shortcut Ctrl-Shift-R works on test files.

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i got a scratch file

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> It is a recent feature. Related, I do not have the latest Comma -- mine is at least 1.5 months old.

[20:14] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I have the latest version.

[20:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> The latest crashed on me a few times, so I reverted to the one from April.
