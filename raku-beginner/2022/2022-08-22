[12:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> Do you consider using `.subst`  a mutation?

[12:19] <lizmat> no, but .= subst I would  :-)

[12:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> agreed

[12:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I have seen the use of the method `.are`  in presentations, but I cannot find documentation for it. Anyone can point to relevant documents or discussions?

[12:26] <SmokeMachine> Anton Antonov: are those presentations from TRC?

[12:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@886919719066697749> No, I think from the conference in Huston this year.

[12:43] <SmokeMachine> would you mind to share a link?

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@886919719066697749> Yeah, I was searching for it in the last 15 min: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DvCPerjve0&t=720s

[12:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> You can see the line `stats[*][2].are;` . I also use `.are` in the package `Data::Reshapers`.

[12:59] <SmokeMachine> Anton Antonov: Thanks
