[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> is there a comb for arrays

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> rotor?

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what would "comb for arrays" actually do?

[15:14] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> exactly what rotor does

[15:15] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> thank u

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> how do i make a sub that can be called *by* a object?

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> something that can be called by all ints for example

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does that mean?

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> m:

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> sub p1 ($x) { $x + 1 }

[18:28] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> say 3.p1;

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh there is a syntax for that

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: sub p1($x) { $x + 1 }; say 3.&p1;

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> oh ok, thank you

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the .& methodoperator

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it works with vanilla blocks as well

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: 3.&{ $^x + 1 }.say

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what does ^x mean? u never declared that

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's kind of the point haha

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> these $^variables turn into positionals parameters in the signature, in alphabetic order

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> these $^variables turn into positional parameters in the signature, in alphabetic order

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2, 3, 87).map({ $^b - $^a }).say

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: (1, 2, 3, 87).map({ $^a - $^b }).say

[18:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> does it make sense?

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ohh yeah i see

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> if i give a array as an argument to append, it will add each element of the list individually. how do i make it add the whole list as i gave it ?

[18:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the idiomatic solution is to just use push

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's kind of a feature of append that it adds the elements individually, if that's not what you want, there is push

[18:51] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> thank you
