[03:59] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Hi

[03:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Hi

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Do we have any development option with atom?

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i think atom is going away

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> there is comma, which is free

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> there is a a paid version with a few extra bells and whistles

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Comma? The Jetbrain based app?

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> https://www.howtogeek.com/810186/atom-text-editor-will-officially-die-later-this-year/

[04:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yes

[04:03] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> What happens with them is beside me! It is exactly like bracket

[04:03] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> I really think atom was far superior than vscode.

[04:03] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> In terms of user experience

[04:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> dunno, never really used it. i just used vim until I started learning raku

[04:05] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> In vim verse I really had hard time with YouCompleteMe. But there is new player in the mix.

[04:05] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Coc

[04:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> vim is nice for total control over the environment but the price you pay is a lot of time figuring out how to customize things

[06:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I tried atom once and it was a huge disappointment

[06:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It was ugly and even the most basic IDE-like features needed very hacky, unreliable plugins

[07:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> youcompleteme is slloooww

[07:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> i use deoplete

[15:31] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone have an inkling why `say (run 'which', 'raku', :out).out.slurp;` shows nothing when run from within a test in Comma IDE? Works fine when run with prove6.
