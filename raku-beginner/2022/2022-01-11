[05:18] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> man, I'm loving how easy it is to create and upload modules. that alone is a good reason to switch to Raku

[05:56] <guifa> stevied++ I saw your module on the weekly today!

[09:10] *** dakkar joined
[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> heh, no kidding? can I collect a check now?

[14:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm also curious... which one was it?

[14:19] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:sdondley/Mac::Applications::List  I presime

[14:19] <lizmat> *presume

[14:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> wow

[14:40] <guifa> stevied lizmat has an amazing weekly recap of all things Raku: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/01/10/2022-01-02-perching/ <-- at the bottom is yours, in the list of new/updated modules

[17:55] <thowe> Is there an env variable I can set that tells raku where to find libraries?  Like PERL5LIB only for raku?

[17:56] <thowe> ah, duh, RAKULIB

[18:48] <thowe> a callback is just a sub passed to another sub as an argument?  Why's everything have to have fancy nonsensical names?

[18:49] <guifa> thowe welcome to the world of jargon

[18:53] <guifa> Generally, the idea is that a sub would have a way to "callback" into a scope it doesn't have access to otherwise 

[18:55] <thowe> so...  With that in mind, are you supposed to pass it a closure?

[18:56] <thowe> I mane, not "supposed to" but is that part of the thinking of the name?

[18:56] <thowe> mean

[18:56] <guifa> In Raku, you can pass it anything that's Code.  It really will depend on what the purpose of the callback is

[18:57] <guifa> they're most useful in asynchronous situations

[18:57] <thowe> Yeah, I get that, I think.  I was just trying to noodle out the origin of the name that I am now mad about as it made me feel like there was some deep shit I wasn't grasping.

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, the Mac::Applications::List module. Just something simple to get my feet wet with Raku.

[18:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I'm going to use it as part of another Raku module I'm going to write for generating json for Karabiner

[18:57] <guifa> for instance let's say in your code you have

[18:58] <thowe> Like, when passing a block to map, is that the same kind of thing?

[18:59] <guifa> Same-ish idea.  you could almost write map as

[19:00] <guifa> sub map ( @array, &code) {¬†code $_ for @array }

[19:00] <guifa> but map doesn't need to know anything about what code does

[19:00] <guifa> just that it takes a single argument (the real map is a bit more complicated, but you get the idea)

[19:01] <thowe> "code $_ for @array"  <- wha?

[19:01] <guifa> m: my @array = 1, 2, 3; say $_ for @array;

[19:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82afbbf04: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§2‚ê§3‚ê§¬ª

[19:02] <thowe> TMTOWTDI boogaloo

[19:03] <guifa> $_ is called the topic in Raku

[19:03] <guifa> when you do for loops, it's set to the item being looped on, unless you specify a different name

[19:03] <guifa> m: my @array = 1,2,3; for @array {¬†say $_ }¬†

[19:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82afbbf04: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§2‚ê§3‚ê§¬ª

[19:03] <thowe> the for coming at the end gave me pause

[19:03] <guifa> aaah

[19:03] <thowe> I'm familiar with $_

[19:04] <guifa> yes, Raku (and its Perl sister) allow postfixes for certain things

[19:04] <guifa> for, if, unless, while, etc, can all be used after a line of code

[19:04] <guifa> m: say "hi" if 2 > 0; say "bye" if 2 < 0;

[19:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82afbbf04: OUTPUT: ¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[19:05] <guifa> m: my $a = 0; say $a while $a++ < 3; 

[19:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82afbbf04: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§2‚ê§3‚ê§¬ª

[19:05] <thowe> the if at the end is something I am familiar with.

[19:07] <guifa> The really cool thing with the for loop is the fact that topicalization means you can just .method call stuff

[19:07] <guifa> m: my @a = 1,2,3; .say for @a

[19:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82afbbf04: OUTPUT: ¬´1‚ê§2‚ê§3‚ê§¬ª

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone know what the "Mi" in App::Mi6 is? Module installer?

[19:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> maybe minimal?

[19:31] <thowe> guifa: it is the cool

[22:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Umm, I know I have asked this one

[22:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but how do you append Sequences to create one Sequence?

[22:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, found it

[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> .map(&slip) probably does the trick still üòÇ
