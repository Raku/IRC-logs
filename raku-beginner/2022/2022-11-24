[18:50] <deoac> I'm having trouble using Unicode Hebrew letters with vowel points.

[18:51] <deoac> Without works fine: m: `'ש'.uniname`

[18:52] <deoac> #output HEBREW LETTER SHIN

[18:52] <deoac> But with a vowel point `say 'ֱש'.uniname`,

[18:52] <deoac> Argument to "say" seems to be malformed

[18:52] <deoac> ------> say⏏ 'ֱש'.uniname

[18:52] <deoac> Bogus postfix

[18:52] <deoac> ------> say ⏏'ֱש'.uniname

[18:52] <deoac>     expecting any of:

[18:52] <deoac>         infix

[18:52] <deoac>         infix stopper

[18:52] <deoac>         postfix

[18:53] <deoac>         statement end

[18:53] <deoac>         statement modifier

[18:53] <deoac>         statement modifier loop

[18:53] <deoac> Other potential difficulties:

[18:53] <deoac>     Unsupported use of bare "say".  In Raku please use: .say if you meant

[18:53] <deoac>     to call it as a method on $_, or use an explicit invocant or argument,

[18:53] <deoac>     or use &say to refer to the function as a noun.

[18:53] <deoac>     ------> say⏏ 'ֱש'.uniname

[19:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m:  'ֱש'.uniname

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think this is not a letter somehow

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if I only copy the middle part without the quotation marks and quote that, it works, moreover it's the original letter

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> is there something that is equivalent to python's `dir`?

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does python's `dir` do?

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> it takes an object as an argument and lists all its attributes and methods

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/type/Metamodel::ClassHOW#(Metamodel::AttributeContainer)_method_attributes I would check around here

[21:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@989550365533937664> First, I do not like Python much. Second, yes, `dir` is cool -- in Raku you can use `.methods` or `.method_table`.

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> or probably `.^methods` because it's a metamethod

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> Correct.

[21:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i tried both. .method give me an error and .^methods gives me ()

[21:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, what you are trying to do here miiight be a bit next-level

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> how could poor Raku metamodel inspect code that isn't Raku in the first place?

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> You are using it wrong. 🙂

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Try "method*" on `$x`.

[21:04] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i know i'm using it wrong, i'm just trying to figure out how wrong

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@989550365533937664> Ahh, sorry -- on the screenshot you commented out `$x`.

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> yeahh i cant figure out if you can use Inline::Python to have objects from python. or if you can only have functions

[21:06] *** sgrs left
[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Cannot help -- I never succeeded installing "Inline::Python" on my computers.

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, why not ask the author?

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> well... it was last updated in 2020

[21:08] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> so i don't think that's gonna be a thing

[21:12] *** NemokoschKiwi joined
[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i'm gonna ask though

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I used extensively the meta-model functions in last few days though. Something close to the use of `dir` in Python can be seen here: https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-UML-Translators

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@989550365533937664> Do you any chance use: 1) Jupyter, or 2) Quarto ?

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@989550365533937664> Do you any chance use: 1) Jupyter, or 2) Quarto ? (While programming in Python.)

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> nah, i don't even know what those are

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what are those?

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Both are "notebook solutions." Jupyter is JSON based, Quarto is Markdown based.

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Quarto is new...

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> huh. well why'd you ask?

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Well, my hypothesis is that you know Python reasonably well. If you used Jupyter or Quarto, I would have tried to talk to you about: 1) using Raku in Jupyter, 2) generating Python code with Raku, and 3) streamlining that in Jupyter.

[21:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Here is an example (with Jupyter) : https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/Notebooks/Jupyter/Standard-data-wrangling-commands-Python.ipynb

[23:45] <deoac> It's "ש\x[05B5]" . Shouldn't this be the same as "\c[HEBREW LETTER SHIN WITH HEBREW POINT TSERE]" ?

[23:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> well, uniname says HEBREW LETTER SHIN and .chars gives 1
