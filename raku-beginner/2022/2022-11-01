[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> * has $!name;

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> * has $!species;

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Package 'Animal' already has an attribute named '$!name'```

[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> A bit confuse with this, why I cant create my own class name Animal?

[00:15] <guifa_> m: class Animal { has $!name; has $!species }

[00:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar a98f1cabe: ( no output )

[00:15] <guifa_> you should be able to

[00:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I know I should, but as you can see it throws me that error.

[00:20] <guifa_> Are you in the REPL?

[00:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Yeah

[00:21] <guifa_> Based on the error, the only thing I can imagine is that somehow it received the line `has $!name` twice

[00:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the REPL is not really reliable for anything that has the smallest compilation potential

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> How so? I work with the class Human from an example in the guide I'm following, and it works fine

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's okay for quick exploration but many things just wouldn't work

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for example, the REPL modules notoriously cannot handle operator definitions

[00:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I also found that it can't handle ñ

[00:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't use it for anything more complex then (non-multi) sub declaration and invocation

[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wouldn't use it for anything more complex than (non-multi) sub declaration and invocation

[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Ok, I'll use it just for this guide. After that I'll just use VS code like always

[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Thanks for the help

[00:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's like a running joke at this point that the promised land comes with RakuAST

[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> RakuAST?

[00:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the problem being that RakuAST still might take more than a year to be complete

[00:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> guifa has at least used some (experimental) RakuAST features

[00:30] <guifa_> RakuAST will be made available via `use experimental` in about a month or so

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I heard that RakuAST would really extend the potential of REPL modules, I don't know how though, can't see it yet

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and still, of course it would only extend their potential if somebody actually used the relevant features

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and made the development on the REPL side

[00:34] <guifa_> Ah, I'm not sure really how it might help on the REPL side.  Mine has been mainly for creating formatters ^_^

[00:34] <guifa_> and DSLs

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, I can recall something

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> perhaps lizmat said it

[00:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> a presentation about it by jnthn

[00:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> (from 2020, to give you an idea about the progress)

[00:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> 2 years

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the thing is, there aren't many people to work on it

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not many people have the knowledge and even less people have the motivation

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you know the weeklies?

[00:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Rakudo weekly news

[00:42] <guifa_> Some of the slowdown was because jnthn wasn't well, and had to step away for a while.  Since it involves a lot of core hacking, there's only so many people that can really work with it

[00:43] * guifa_ is afk

[00:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That's quite unfortunate...

[00:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Is the Raku community consider small? I though part of the Perl community was also interest in it.

[00:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That's a long story and I'm probably not an authentic person to talk about it

[00:46] *** Kaiepi left
[00:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Long story short, as it became obvious that Raku won't be the next iteration of Perl in the replacement sense, a serious scratch evolved within the Perl community

[00:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> And when this was finalized by the renaming of the language, I'd say this scratch developed further into a break

[00:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> so now the languages are similar, the goals are more or less similar but not many people think in "Perl and Raku" in the core communities of the languages

[00:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> If you ask me, this is a pity because Perl has a massive legacy and it seems like this wasn't utilized well

[00:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, back to the question <@179666061795262464>

[00:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> do you know the rakudo weeklies that lizmat writes and posts here?

[00:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Just saw them today, so yeah

[00:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> then you can see something like

[00:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > Stefan Seifert continued working on the RakuAST branch, allowing native / custom array types to be used as attributes, upping number of passing test-files to 536/1354 (+4) and 68/131 (+3).

[00:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I for one like to connect the full names to the online nicknames - Stefan Seifert is nine / niner

[14:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> plenty, though i can't comment on their quality https://raku.land/?q=pdf

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well that's an interesting interpretation

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Didn't I rather say something along the lines of "I started Raku because Python was too cumbersome for scripting"?

[17:05] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> would i rather write python than raku? no!

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> is it possible to do productive things in raku with a small python-like subset? yes!

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> would i like to see raku replace python? yes! (it is a step change in coding power)

[17:09] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> so i am impressed by the 1000s x larger community that python has and i would like to encourage some of these folks to come over and try raku and maybe take it seriously

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> that would help us get more tuits to do more stuff and squash down any remaining negatives

[17:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think we can talk about what Python gets right and what Raku has better - but perhaps this isn't the right place

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Python is for people who do not want to program — i.e. eternal beginners. Raku , _currently_, is for people who want to program. So, Raku has to have much more mileage in order to “replace” Python.

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> You are insulting a big bunch of the industry by saying that 💀

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> You are insulting a big bunch of the industry by saying that about Python  💀

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I started Raku because I feel curious. I bought this big bundle of programming books because there was a Perl book along side all those other books of python and Java, and then found out Perl 6 existed

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "You are insulting a big bunch of the industry by saying that about Python" -- Maybe, maybe not. More comprehensive insulting is given here : https://pythonforprediction.wordpress.com/2022/09/18/breakdown-of-python-people-and-projects/ .

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> "I started Raku because I feel curious." -- You are confirming what I am saying : it seems that you want to program. (Hence trying out Raku.)

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think this is a bit like that "real programmer" joke from the old times, seventies or maybe eighties

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am not sure what you are referring to, but, I would say that currently Raku is for "real programmers." (I.e. people who want to program.)

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296>  I see. You might appreciate the effort of making this meme (and even like it):

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> To be honest, this somewhat reflects my implementing of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in Raku -- I do it because of the "from scratch" challenges, but I really wish Raku was faster.

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm afraid the only way to escape this catch-22-ish situation is to get users who don't mind the performance and then work out the improvements on the way

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yeah -- my approach is to use DSLs and "clothes have no emperor" principle. But it is not embraced as much I as though it might be.

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if it were easy to make Rakudo faster, it would already be faster - and tbh it is "faster" - compared to its former self

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> consider the new dispatch mechanism, for example

[18:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Related : "The cure of high prices is high prices."

[18:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> There is a relevant Bulgarian proverb : "The Wolf has thick neck because he does his work himself."

[18:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> The speed of Raku is not so bad as far as I had experience.

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> By faster, you mean Java fast, Lua fast or C fast?

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> <@694526400488669234>

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@179666061795262464> Last time I was doing stuff with Lua, 10 years ago, it was not fast... But that might have changed. See the performance section here : https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2022/06/22/mltrieswithfrequencies/ 

[18:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> It compares Java, Mathematica, and Raku speeds over "Prefix trees with frequencies" implementations.

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@179666061795262464> I recently made a comprehensive comparison of the same type of a Recommender System (RS) implemented in eight different languages. The Raku implementation is the reference implementation of Java, Kotlin, SQLite, and Swift, but I could not include into the overall comparison statistics because ingesting data with Raku was so slow (the actual RS computations were slow too.) On advice given here I used CBOR 

[18:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Granted, Python was using a OS-native C library, the Raku "CBOR::Simple" is pure Raku, but still...

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my personal problem is that it's hard to anticipate what is costly and what isn't
