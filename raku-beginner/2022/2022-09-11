[16:26] <ae_chep> What's happening here? `my $x = foo() and bar()` is truthy even when `bar()` is falsy. I had to put the entire statement in paranthesis

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> `$x` being truthy/falsy?

[16:35] <ae_chep> yes, I ended up finding $x to be `True` when both `foo()` and `bar()` was False

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> if `foo()` were truthy, `and`'s looser associativity compared to `=` would prevent `bar()` from being assigned

[16:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> but if both are falsey, i'm not sure how that'd occur from this statement alone

[16:41] <ae_chep> no the first one is falsy

[16:42] <ae_chep> and I assumed the `and` to have higher precedence than the assignment

[16:42] <ae_chep> I think assignment has the higher precedence, in this case

[16:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> there is an `&&` with a tighter precedence you could get rid of the parentheses with

[17:12] <ae_chep> I see, thank you

[23:59] <Heptite> I'm just under a third of the way through Learning Perl 6, and I'm wondering if there are people who remember ALL of the language's grammar, operators, etc?
