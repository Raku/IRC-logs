[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: my %dict = :1one :2two :3three; dd %dict;

[10:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ^ what happens in this case?

[11:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> my wild guess is

[11:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> it doesn't have anything to do with the LHS %dict assignment

[11:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> m: say :1one :2two :3three

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> This RHS constructs a pair out of 1 => one

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> and other things ` :2two :3three` are named arguments to the Pair constructor

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> which are ineffective

[11:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> you can pass named arguments without comma-separating them

[11:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> i.e., `Pair.new("one", 1):2two:3three` is first constructed

[11:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> This RHS constructs a pair out of one => 1

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: my %dict = (:1one :2two :3three; dd %dict;

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: my %dict = (:1one:2two:3three); dd %dict;

[11:24] <lizmat>  m: my %dict = (:1one:2two:3three); dd %dict;

[15:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> so what's the why of it?

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think you were mostly right

[15:19] *** razetime left
[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> did you find a documentation explaining this

[15:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not really üòÖ

[15:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> so this was a personal conclusion I understand?

[16:38] *** dakkar left
[17:00] <guifa> AIUI, the problem is that trailing :foo(bar) will be interpreted first as an adverb, secondly as a pair if it's not possible to be an adverb
