[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can't figure this error out. got this:

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `like 'blah', m:s/0 '-' Parent menu/, 'handles parent menu';`

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's a test

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I get this nasty error:

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Use of uninitialized value of type Any in string context.

[07:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[07:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you match against $_ actually, I suppose

[07:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> why is my regex a Nil:U

[07:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because it's not a regex

[07:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> don't get this error if I take out the `m:s` modifier

[07:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's a failed match call

[07:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> YES, exactly

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the m:s modifier makes it a call, rather than a regex

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and that call fails

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> = first error

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you get Nil from it

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I see

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> = second error

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so how do I fix?

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why did you want to put m:s there in the first place?

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so I can just type in spaces

[07:24] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> easier

[07:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what about rx:s?

[07:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, that did it

[07:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I assumed the 'm' stood for modifier but I guess it stands for match

[07:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> thanks!

[07:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it does stand for match

[07:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, i thought it was acting as some kind of delimiter to start the modifer string

[07:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yeah nah

[07:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that's specifically for matching

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Anonymous_regex_definition_syntax

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > Secondly, the rx form allows you to insert regex adverbs between rx and the opening delimiter to modify the definition of the entire regex. This is equivalent to inserting the adverb at the beginning of the regex, but may be clearer:

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so supposedly you could do /:s 0 '-' Parent menu/ as well?

[07:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but yeah perhaps rx:s does look better

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> huh

[07:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> regexes and oo trip me up the most. they are similar to Perl/Moose but very different.

[07:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't use oo so that's one down ðŸ˜„

[07:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so what's the process for getting a pull request approved in a community module? I got this one pending: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/Test-Output/pull/8

[07:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> who else reviews it?
