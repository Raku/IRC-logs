[04:36] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[05:19] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> if you have "if" at the end of a statement, is there no way to have an else?

[05:20] <discord-raku-bot> <South> nope you cannot

[05:20] <discord-raku-bot> <South> its the same case in ruby

[05:21] <discord-raku-bot> <South> you can read more about that here <https://docs.raku.org/syntax/if#else/elsif>

[05:23] <discord-raku-bot> <South> there are ternaries that do this but depending on how you like your code some things might better be served with an actual if/else block, like modifying variables

[05:25] *** discord-raku-bot left
[05:26] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Yeah, you want a ternary

[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> `my $y = $x > 3 ?? 'big' !! 'smol';`

[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Or you know... maybe not

[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> `my $y = (if $x > 3 { 'big' } else { 'smol' });`

[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ooo

[05:29] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> actually yes

[05:31] <discord-raku-bot> <South> for that particular case i would definitely go with the ternary

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> yeah... but if you feel like you wanna nest ternarys... it's usually a recipe for poor readability, and an `if/else` block is probably better

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <South> this is very trye

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <South> this is very true

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <South> and i have been known to do such things in the name of wickedness

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```perl

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> $c < $_.chars ?? $_.substr($c, 1).uc !! ' '

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> this is fine then?

[05:35] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> haha yes! I've sometimes started with a ternary, then expanded it with another condition or two before I realise what a monstrosity it is

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Even trying to format it logically, this is ugly

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> ```

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> say $x > 5

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>     ?? $x %% 2

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>       ?? $x == 10

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>         ?? 'big-ten'

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>         !! 'big-even'

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>       !! 'big-odd'

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>     !! 'smol'

[05:36] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> ```

[05:37] <discord-raku-bot> <South> yeah definitely lmfao

[05:37] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> yeah this is fine. Ternarys are good for short if/else with simple expressions.

[05:39] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> im trynna figure out why ?? and !!

[05:39] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> is it?? then do this thing

[05:39] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> its not!! well then do something else

[05:39] <discord-raku-bot> <South> `cond ?? if_true !! if_false`

[05:39] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i know this is not from raku or from perl but it just looks funny to me

[05:40] <discord-raku-bot> <South> tho usually youll see `cond ? if_true : if_false` in other languages like ruby/java/c++(iirc)

[06:37] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> As <@768182477449592832>  said, ternary in C, Perl (and other C-like langues) is written `cond ? if_true : if_false`... but since ternary is not really used much, it was decided that the `:` was too valuable to waste on it.

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> If anything `??` and `!!` make a little more sense in Raku, since `?` prefix boolifies something, and `!` does negative-boolification

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> ```

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> [0] > ?'yes'

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> True

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> [1] > !'no'

[06:38] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> [3] > !0

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> The main takeaway was "maybe we shouldn't add unicode ops "just because"

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> but there's enthusiasm for digits in random languages?

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> like tibetan or what was it?

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Well, I don't think it requires much effort to support them. Anything in the `Nd` block (Number, Decimal digit) gets parsed as a number.

[14:12] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Also, what you call a "random language" could be someone's native language. Those _numbers_ are valid digits, just as valid as Arabic numerals.

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> yeah, but raku itself is in english

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> and why support some languages but not others?

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i tried chinese digits, they didn't work

[14:21] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Probably because they do not have the Unicode property (Nd) that defines them as a digit?

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied> anyone know where an updated version of this page is? https://docs.raku.org/perl6.html

[16:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i don't really want them at all, i think having unicode characters *anywhere* outside of a string literal is weird

[16:36] *** razetime joined
[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> All the characters you just typed are Unicode üòÄ 

[16:43] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> But I know what you mean... you mean you only want ASCII... but that is a very Anglo-centric view of language. ASCII is also very limiting in terms of operators. Raku is implicitly trying to push against these restrictions and limitations.

[16:44] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what kinda operator would you want that's not doable with ascii?

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> and also, the planet is anglo-centric too

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> You can use ASCII, for all your operators, but you either need to overload your operators, or make digraphs like J (where, eg. sort is `/:~`).

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Raku also borrows an idea from Perl. In Perl, it is often said "they types are in the operators". That's why in Perl `1 + '2'` is not as insane as it seems, because `+` means numeric addition. In Python, `+` might be numeric addtion, or it might be string concat.

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Having unique operators means you can do automatic coercion. You run out of unique operators with just ASCII. Everyone agrees operator overloading is perilous... but what's the solution? Raku provides a alternative to operator overloading (in the traditional sense)

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i think that typing 3 characters on the keyboard is faster than googling the character and copying and pasting it

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> it's also more readable than a white rectangle, cause i don't have the fontset for some random unicode character

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> You don't need to copy/paste. You've got options.

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> There's various methods on how to imput Unicode characters, I think there's a page about it in the docs.

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro>  I use the vim digraphs feature, so I hit a key and then `-:` gives me `√∑`, or `>>` gives me `¬ª`. Most the symbols I like to use have easy to remember digraphs.

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Or... don't use any of these symbols... just use the ASCII variants.

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> https://docs.raku.org/language/unicode_entry

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ive got compose key

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> it's the thing you said but it's everywhere in x11

[17:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> so how do i type the equivalent of (elem)

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> in Vim, the digraph is `(-` (which gives `‚àà`)

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> I've also customised/created some of my own digraphs to make them easier to remember, eg `(!`  does `‚àâ`

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> digraphs... i use the vim-raku mappings but they're kind of a PITA

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> {

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> this is what i got when i typed that

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> yeah, i've turned on that feature twice in my life... both times I turned it off within a few mins

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Sorry, replied to the wrong message

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Meant to reply to Kaiepi

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> yeah

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Meant to reply to <@210313526928080896>

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> so yeah, the vim digraphs don't map exactly to compose-key combos

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> and i can't really find a list of compose keys

[17:25] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> I ended up to define my own digraphs. A list of characters useful for Raku can be found at: https://github.com/gfldex/digraphs/blob/master/bin/digraphs.pl

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> and this just becomes one more thing for text editors to have to implement

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> making them more complicated to develop and more complicated to learn

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> if raku for example were to have mass adoption

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Actually, that is not true in my case. I use screen and vim. vim never sees the digraphs.

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what do you mean?

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> I use GNU Screen and start the digraphs from there. As such I can use them in any terminal application. I use them in bash, irrsi and vim. So I'm well covered for my typing needs. :)

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> yes, but what if someone is using a GUI editor like a normal person?

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Then you can convert digraph tables to xinput config files. And yes, there is xinput for Windows.

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what's xinput?

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> The window manager input layer in X11.

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> got it

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what's that?

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> what's this supposed to tell

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> *me

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> do you want me to read the whole thing?

[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> The frist 2 lined should do.

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> The frist 2 lines should do.

[17:36] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i know what xorg is

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> If you want to input non-ASCII characters reliably, and it's not something you're familiar with... you will need to do some light learning.

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> For some people around the world, entering non-ASCII/non-Latin1 characters is an everyday occurence

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> yah, like myself

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄŒµŒπœÇ;

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> And I would assume that people who use a particular setup are "normal" and people who don't are "other". Pretty sure gfldex and myself are normal people. Well, fairly normal.

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> why not just use single quotes

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Finding a good terminal font was the tricky part, actually. But that way 10 years ago (or so).

[17:42] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> instead of googling both of those characters

[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> m: But what if you got both 'single quote' and "quote" in your HEREDOC?

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> EOH

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> say $data; #

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> ```

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Not our invention tho. Larry stole that with Perl 5 from some unix shell.

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i thought i'd learn raku because it looked like fun

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> in retrospect that was very extremely stupid

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> programming skill isnt memorising all of the features in a language

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> its actually knowing how to write instructions that do what you want

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> whats the point of raku existing anyway

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> m:```

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> my $text = qq:to/WORD/;

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex>     Sometimes you got more text then { ‚Äòedoc‚Äô.flip }, here HEREDOCs shine.

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> WORD

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> say $text;

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> ```

[18:00] <lizmat> yabobay: how many programming languages do you know?

[18:01] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Why invent C then? Macro assemblers worked just fine!

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> its fine if the number of features isn't literally infinite

[18:03] <lizmat> then I suggest you learn C, there's not a lot of syntax there to learn, and the number of features is limited

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> lizmat: none really

[18:03] <lizmat> learning the standard lib is another matter though  :-)

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> The list of features of any programming language is infinite. Most of them just hide them in external libraries.

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ive heard multiple say that nobodys gonna know everything about raku

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> the thing about C is that there isn't even any real support for strings

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> just syntactic sugar

[18:04] <lizmat> yabobay: I've been able to tell people some feature of Perl that they didn't know about, while having worked with Perl daily for 25+ years

[18:05] <lizmat> so I think just about any programming language has corners that you'd not know about for a loooong time

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> thats what im saying

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> thats not a good thing

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> is it?

[18:05] <lizmat> just as natural languages for that matter

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> well we dont have control over natural languages

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> learning a natural language is famously a difficult and long process

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> You can use ASCII, for all your operators, but you either need to overload your operators, or make digraphs like J (where, eg. sort is `/:~`).

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Raku also borrows an idea from Perl. In Perl, it is often said "the types are in the operators". That's why in Perl `1 + '2'` is not as insane as it seems, because `+` means numeric addition. In Python, `+` might be numeric addtion, or it might be string concat.

[18:08] <discord-raku-bot> <elcaro> Having unique operators means you can do automatic coercion. You run out of unique operators with just ASCII. Everyone agrees operator overloading is perilous... but what's the solution? Raku provides a alternative to operator overloading (in the traditional sense)

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> anyway, im sorry for being a massive idiot with everything i've said today up to now

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> I had the same feelings when I started to learn the language. Nowadays I love to compose a _nice_ Raku program, even if a simple one would have done the job too.

[18:13] <lizmat> .oO( ah you youngsters, in my time there was hardly any documentation :-)

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> as a programming beginner , it feels bad not to be able to feel good about implementing some simple functionality because theres already a function for that

[18:22] <lizmat> but but: you *should* feel good if your learned something from it

[18:23] <lizmat> independent of whether the functionality existed already or not

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> but i dont need to do those things because they already exist

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> Don't worry, you will quickly hit the limits of the buildins and then you will have to compose with primitives.

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i hope so

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> maybe i should try really using raku for something

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i had a python script that i think would be quite good to re-make in raku

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <South> the phasers seem much more powerful

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <South> less noise too

[21:57] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> out of context, youre talking bout a space ship

[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <South> lol
