[00:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> any way to pretty print the output of `dd` function?

[02:24] <guifa> You might look at https://raku.land/github:nkh/Data::Dump::Tree

[02:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> thanks, yeah. I found Data::Dumper. works for me

[03:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> alright, my vote for worst design decision in Raku: allowing hyphens in names.

[03:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> easy to get them mixed up

[03:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I wonder what the reason was? Anyone know?

[03:33] <guifa> You'll find most people don't share that opinion :-)  Kebab case is seen as being easier to read than camel or snake case

[03:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> that may be, but makes it harder to remember whether to use hyphen or underscore

[03:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I just did `done_testing` but it's `done-testing`;

[03:35] <guifa> in Raku it's basically always a hyphen

[03:36] <guifa> The only left overs that are underscore are internal Rakudo and/or MOP stuff

[03:36] <guifa> (and it's generally useful there, as it's a way of warning you that here be dragons)

[03:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok

[03:40] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so I should adopt the practice of using hypens in all identifiers, I guess?

[09:21] <lizmat> stevied: that'd be the easiest: it also sets it apart visually from Perl code  :-)

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't see that as a bad design decision either <:cameliathink:897316667653247057> I just wish Vim would know about it by default

[09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> I do love kebab case, but it does sometimes break IDE support

[11:31] <tbrowder> kebab case and much less typing overall are some of my fav things about raku v perl

[11:33] <tbrowder> the "line noise" complaint can't be used anymore imho

[11:38] <gfldex> I'm pretty sure I could write line-noise-raku if I wanted to. :->

[11:42] <lizmat> gfldex: I'm pretty sure that you do now and then, when you're going crazy  :-)

[11:42] <lizmat> and I know it's my fault  :-)

[11:43] <gfldex> You did help a great deal with my Raku adventures indeed.
