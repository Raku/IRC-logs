[06:59] <jaguart> how do I call a method named in a string on an object? 

[07:02] <jaguart> I want to say something like: $o.$m() where $m contains the name of a method

[07:03] <jaguart> I tried: $o.&{$m} and $o.$m() 

[07:53] <CIAvash> `$o."$m"()`?

[08:38] <jaguart> CIAvash++ - thank you

[08:40] <jaguart> oh - in my actual use-case I get: only basic method calls that exclusively use a dot can be detached

[08:50] <jaguart> actually - that was a type - works for me, thanks!

[23:50] <habere-et-disper> The REPL always complains about not finding Readline which is installed. Am I missing some setup?

[23:50] <habere-et-disper> It's looking in '/usr/local/opt/readline/lib' and Readline appears installed elsewhere.

[23:51] <habere-et-disper> The error is: "Failed to get the directory contents of '/usr/local/opt/readline/lib': Failed to open dir: No such file or directory"

[23:51] <habere-et-disper> (That's the REPL complaining.)
