[01:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@486998692683841566> Yes, I can fork the code, but then what exactly happens when I publish the "fixed version" to raku.land and/or PAUSE? It seems to me someone has to point out somewhere what is the most current/useful package version.

[09:51] <MasterDuke> Anton Anonov: you'll publish with a different author and probably an increased version. zef will then default to yours since it has a higher version (though someone can always specify exactly what author/version/etc they want)
