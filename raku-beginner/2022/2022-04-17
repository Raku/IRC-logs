[05:57] <deadmarshal> Why catch blocks are inside the try block in raku? shouldn't the catch block be outside try block like: https://metacpan.org/pod/Try::Tiny#SYNOPSIS ?

[07:35] <lizmat> you don't need CATCH inside a try, and you don't need a try outside of a CATCH

[07:35] <lizmat> in Raku, a CATCH allows you to catch *any* exception *IN* the scope where the CATCH lives

[07:36] <lizmat> m: CATCH { .resume }; die; say "still alive"

[07:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «still alive␤»

[07:37] <lizmat> inside the CATCH, the exception object is in $_, so you can easily do smart-matching on it

[08:25] <deadmarshal> great thank you

[08:27] <lizmat> "try" is when you just want to be lazy

[08:27] <lizmat> m: say try die

[08:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[08:27] <lizmat> try will try to execute the code given, and return Nil if there was an exception

[08:28] <lizmat> m: say try 42

[08:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[08:28] <deadmarshal> nice
