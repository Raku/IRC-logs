[20:10] <Heptite> Is there a way to suppress color in the error output from raku?

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> huh, is it colored by default?

[20:14] <Heptite> It is for me.

[20:15] <Heptite> The "SORRY!" is bracketed by red ===

[20:15] <Heptite> And so on.

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes yes, I can vaguely recall but unfortunately I'm clueless

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's going to stderr though, right?

[20:17] <Heptite> Yes.

[20:20] <Kaiepi> Heptite, setting RAKUDO_ERROR_COLOR=0 in the env should get rid of it

[20:20] <Heptite> Thank you.

[20:20] * SmokeMachine thinks that was a ‚Äúgreat idea‚Äù to create a ORM called a colour name‚Ä¶ and get a notification every time someone says that something was red‚Ä¶

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I mean, we could do the usual trick and refer to it as Redlib or something - implying, of course, that it doesn't mean some other relevant thing
