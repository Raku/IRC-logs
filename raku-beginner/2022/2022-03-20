[05:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone have any idea why comma isn't recognizing the testing subroutines in my test file?

[05:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Errors with `Subroutine X is not declared`

[05:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> the project sdk settings are set to Raku v2021.12 v2121.12

[15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yeah, I have seen that. Did not find inconvenient enough to complain... ðŸ™‚

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @stevied#8273 BTW, I do not see it in my current Comma project/setup. Have you assigned values to all value cells in "Project Structure" ?

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, i'm not really complaining. I just want to know if I'm doing something wrong. I've never used an IDE before (at least not seriously)

[16:05] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it turns our restarting the IDE fixed it. I had tried that before but I think setting the SDK again is what broke it.

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> now I'm having this other weird problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71548158/intellij-not-showing-lines-that-begin-with-in-test-output

[16:08] *** razetime left
[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hmm... I have to say that I have hard time giving advice here -- I have similar "random" IntelliJ frustrations. What is your OS? (Mine is macOS.)

[17:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, macos

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I think it has something to do with how intellij interacts with the Test module. If I take out the "plan 1;" from the test file, I get errors but I do see the missing line in the output.

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> could have something to do with the TAP protocol, too

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, so looking at https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html the lines beginning with `#` are diagnostics

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it says harness can ignore them

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ugh, so this works: `stdout-like ({ $md_obj.dump }, /This/, 'can dump file');`

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this is does not: `stdout-like ({ $md_obj.dump }, /This is/, 'can dump file');`

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> error: `Potential difficulties:

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     Space is not significant here; please use quotes or ðŸ˜’ (:sigspace) modifier (or, to suppress this warning, omit the space, or otherwise change the spacing)

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `

[18:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> but this doesn't work either: `stdout-like ({ $md_obj.dump }, m:s/This is/, 'can dump file');`

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> error: 

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `Use of uninitialized value of type Any in string context.

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, this worked: `stdout-like ({ $md_obj.dump }, /'This is'/, 'can dump file');`

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> but I really don't understand this at all

[18:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i've never seen quotes used like that in a regex

[19:00] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> actually, maybe I have now that I think about it

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> had to use it for some other raku regex I wrote with a `#` sign

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I don't know why m:s// didn't work, though

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, this works: `stdout-like ({ $md_obj.dump }, rx :s/\# This is a markdown file/, 'can dump file');`

[19:04] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> threw a `rx` in front of it to let stdout-like know it was a regex

[19:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i guess it's not smart enough to detect it. dunno.
