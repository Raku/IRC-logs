[00:06] <thowe> how do I take something like "my $block = { put $_ }" and feed it an array to iterate over? 

[00:07] <thowe> feed @array to $myblock?

[00:10] <MasterDuke> m: my &block = { put $_ }; my @array = <a b c>; @array.map(&block)  # you mean something like this?

[00:11] <thowe> so, use "map"?

[00:12] <thowe> yeah, map works.  That had actually occurred to me and somehow I was convinced Isaw a way to do it by using -> and I guess I didn't.

[00:14] <thowe> I love how Raku tells me I am wrong because I am trying to do Perl 5 things...

[00:15] <thowe> Raku doesn't really seem to care if I use $myblock or &myblock, which makes me wonder which is actually "more" correct.

[00:17] <MasterDuke> when you're kind of telling it what to do it doesn't matter as much. but for example, using the "right" sigil matters more if you're passing it to a multi-sub/method with candidates for a callable or not

[00:19] <thowe> hm, yeah, OK

[00:19] <guifa> m: my $block = { say "peso" }; my &block = { say "amp" }; $block; block

[00:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 006a920ca: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤amp␤Useless use of $block in sink context (line 1)␤»

[00:20] <guifa> m: my $block = { say "peso" }; my &block = { say "amp" }; sink $block; sink block

[00:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 006a920ca: OUTPUT: «amp␤»

[00:22] <guifa> when you assign to &var, you can call it just like any other sub.  If you assign to a $var, to call, you'll need to explicitly use parenteses, e.g. $block(1,2,3), vs being able to just do block 1, 2, 3 if you've ampersanded it

[00:28] <thowe> ah.. lemme play with that.

[00:28] <thowe> looks like need to use colon...

[00:29] <thowe> "@speeds.map: &speedkb;" works,   "@speeds.map &speedkb;" no work.

[00:29] <thowe> which is prob to be expected...

[01:29] <guifa> yeah, you need the colon because the colon is used to separate a method from its arguments if you go without parentheses
