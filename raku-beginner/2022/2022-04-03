[02:59] <drakonis> i suppose you could say that, but i see it as being free from the shackles of a specific style

[03:00] <drakonis> it has its perks

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> If I want to check an object to see whether is a Str or Match, is this method the way to do it: method type_check($definite_type, $checkee)

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> not sure what a "definite" type is

[19:08] <lizmat> m: say "foo" ~~ Str

[19:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:08] <lizmat> m: "foo" ~~ / foo /; say $/ ~~ Str

[19:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[19:09] <lizmat> m: "foo" ~~ / foo /; say $/ ~~ Match

[19:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> thanks. I read somewhere that could sometimes be wrong and wasn't a good way

[19:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> wasn't reliable, I guess. my memory is fuzzy though

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, found something in the docs: https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Type_objects

[19:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> OK, the D is for definite.

[20:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can someone tell me what I might be doing wrong here? :   `my $match = HC.parse( $content, actions => "$::($class)::action" );`

[20:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm trying to use the action stored in a variable inside of a class: `our $action = HCActionsStripTaskwiki.new;`

[20:58] <lizmat> my $acrtions = HCActionStripRTaskwiki.new; my $match = HC.parse($content, :$actions)

[20:58] <lizmat> ?

[20:58] <lizmat> *$actions

[20:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> actually, probably because it's in a class, now that I htink about it. I dont' have any reason to use that as a class anymore.

[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> didn't seem to help or I don't know what you are trying to show me (more likely)

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> when I print out "$::($class)::action" I get `Vimwiki::File::TextProcessingClasses::strip-taskwiki::HCActionsStripTaskwiki<140207354714080>`

[21:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> not sure what that number bit is there at the end

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> looks like I got something working thanks to my patented flail around and try random things method of coding
