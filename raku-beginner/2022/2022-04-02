[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <venus007e#0070> Why does the raku bot just write random questions etc.?

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs#5025> Actually, those are comments copied here from the IRC channel (<#768511641758466088> at irc.libera.chat).

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <venus007e#0070> oh cool

[21:45] <discord-raku-bot> <lucs#5025> And similarly, comments from here are copied to the IRC channel.

[21:46] <drakonis> but it doesn't apply to the channels that are marked as bridged to irc

[21:47] <drakonis> they are only bridged from irc, that is.

[21:47] <discord-raku-bot> <venus007e#0070> Also, i was wondering, if raku can technically be seen as a functional language, because it has many aspects, simelar to for example scala, and scala is known for beeing functional.

[22:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Raku is often referred to as a multi-paradigm language

[22:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Which just means it can do procedural , OO, or functional styles of programming
