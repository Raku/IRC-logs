[00:36] <guifa> not a regex

[00:36] <guifa> ^5 is equivalent to 0 .. 4

[00:36] <guifa> m: .say for ^5

[00:37] <guifa> The idea is that 0 to $x - 1 is a super common range that people use, especially in for loops.  for ^5 { … } loops exactly five times

[06:15] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> Does anyone know how to define an operator with two variants at once. I have a ♩PM operator, but also want to allow QNPM (quarter-notes per minute). I tried the following code, but it failed:

[06:15] <discord-raku-bot> <pelevesque> ```sub postfix:<♩PM|QNPM>($n) { (60000000 / $n).floor }; say 60QNPM;

[08:44] <guifa> pelevesque: you'll have to define them separately
