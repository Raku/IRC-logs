[07:31] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: thank you for your answer! Another question: will rak have a `-o` option?

[08:09] *** dakkar joined
[08:30] <lizmat> to output to a file?

[09:48] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: no, to show only the matched part of the line

[09:48] <lizmat> ah, ok

[09:51] <SmokeMachine> for example: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5IVA12CC/CleanShot%202022-06-23%20at%2010.50.42%402x.png

[09:55] <lizmat> what if multiple parts of the line match?  all of them?  or just the first ?

[10:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Does Raku not have stuff like the @F record variable in Perl?

[10:16] <lizmat> "The array @F contains the fields of each line read in when autosplit mode is turned on. See perlrun for the -a switch. This array is package-specific, and must be declared or given a full package name if not in package main when running under strict 'vars'."

[10:16] <lizmat> could you give me an example of how you'd see that in Raku ?

[10:19] <lizmat> I can't recall ever having used @F in Perl myself

[10:20] <lizmat> Nemokosch ^^

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I liked it for proper `cut`

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that splits on any whitespace, not one instance of a certain character

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> psg aux | perl -lane 'print $F[1]'

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or something

[10:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> not a big deal frankly, just wanted to confirm

[11:04] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I think it should be all matched parts of the lineâ€¦

[11:04] <lizmat> ok, separated by space?

[11:04] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dudgA4bp/CleanShot%202022-06-23%20at%2012.04.14%402x.png

[11:05] <SmokeMachine> each one on its own line (IMHO)

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> \*witnessing an API design live\* exciting

[11:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

[11:07] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: and just repeat the line number ?

[11:08] <SmokeMachine> that's a good question... maybe not add line numbers if `-o`? Could line numbers be optional and disabled by default? (sorry, I'm just thinking that it would be easier to pipe)

[11:10] <lizmat> yeah, line numbers are going to be switchoffable

[11:11] <SmokeMachine> about @F, I'd use that with something like this: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/MA0Fs4Ly/CleanShot%202022-06-23%20at%2012.11.25%402x.png

[11:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also legit

[11:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I consider it an improved `cut`

[11:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: would you mind if I do one more feature request?

[11:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and if I can do it in Perl, why start with something additional that I cannot meaningfully use for anything else? (awk, that is)

[11:16] <lizmat> rak '{ my @F = .split(":"); @F[0] if @F > 5 }' /etc/passwd

[11:16] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: ^^ would that work for you ?

[11:17] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: maybe start making issues for them in https://github.com/lizmat/App-Rak ?

[11:17] <SmokeMachine> the @F, I'd like to have it in raku, better than in rak...

[11:22] <SmokeMachine> but my feature request for rak is kinda related to that... it would be have a way to do something like: `rak '/pattern/' --by-line '.uc #any transformation'`and/or `rak '/pattern/' --by-file '.IO.absolute # any transformation'`. Anything inside --by-line would be a block that would run for each line where pattern was matched and the same on --by-file, but it would receive the file. probably those options should conflict 

[11:22] <SmokeMachine> and rak would print the return of those blocks...

[11:25] <lizmat> well, my example above would do that already?

[11:25] <lizmat> if you specify a Callable, and it doesn't return a Bool or an Empty, it would be considered something to say ?

[11:25] <SmokeMachine> not for files, would it?

[11:26] <SmokeMachine> I really like your idea

[11:27] <SmokeMachine> maybe it could have a way to specify that should run by file instead of by line?

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, I already like this module, just by hearing about it

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I write `find . -type f -exec grep "blah" {} \; -print` several times a day...

[11:32] <SmokeMachine> I have another idea but that one maybe should be in a different tool, not rak... that would be: if you are searching by code, do that by act instead of by string... so, you could to: `$TOOL 'loop { .. }' and it would understand you are looking for any (infinity) loop, get every Raku code on the current path, get its past and search for a (infinite) loop on it...

[11:33] <SmokeMachine> Nemokosch: why not `grep -R`?

[11:33] <SmokeMachine> (I suppose my AST search would not perform very well... but I think that would be very useful...)

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I haven't heard of -R in the first place, to be frank

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but either way, I won't be able to abandon the find-exec-grep pattern

[11:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because Solaris 8 ðŸ¤ª

[11:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, can I silence "is a folder" type of errors?

[11:43] <SmokeMachine> you mean with -R?

[11:44] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Nu9LBLUb/CleanShot%202022-06-23%20at%2012.44.06%402x.png

[11:47] <SmokeMachine> I like `grep -R` but because I usually need it inside git repos, I usually use `git grep` more...
