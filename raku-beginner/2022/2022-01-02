[02:57] <guifa> tope#9134: actually, the role method won't speed things up, I just did some testing on that.  I'm trying to see if I can find a way to speed it up a bit but no promises

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Razetime#5187> how would i apply a function at given indices in an array?

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```perl

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > my @a = 1,2,3,4

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> [1 2 3 4]

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > my @idx = 1,3

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> [1 3]

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > @a[@idx] = @a[@idx]>>.&{$_ + 9}

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> (11 13)

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > @a

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> [1 11 3 13]

[10:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> if you don't want to restate the `@idx`, you can do:

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```perl

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> @a[@idx] .= map(* + 9)

[10:09] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```

[13:16] <SmokeMachine> tope#9134: here is an example of adding a candidate to infix:<+>: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Operators.pm6#L47

[13:20] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> guifa: for now I'm not overly concerned with speed but trying to understand how it's possible / isn't possible. like with the `&infix:<+> does ROLE` solution, I don't know how to access the normal +(int,int) from inside that role(??). when I try to callsame from `+(IntSubclass, Int)` (to do a `+(Int,Int)`), `callsame` just returns undef for some reason. `callsame` from `+(IntSubclass, IntSubclass)` corre

[13:23] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> SmokeMachine: and yeah that is what I had originally. I could add and do arithmetic fine for myself, but when I gave my special `IntSubclass` instances away for other libraries that did arithmetic (like `Math::Vector`), they were just reverted to `Int`s.

[13:24] <SmokeMachine> m: my @a = 1,2,3,4; say @a; my @idx = 1, 3; @a[@idx] >>+=>> 9; say @a

[13:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar d80fb897e: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3 4]␤[1 11 3 13]␤»

[13:26] <SmokeMachine> tope#9134: you just need to also export your operator… and that will be able to be used…

[13:29] <SmokeMachine> tope#9134: like here (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red.pm6#L40) everything someone `use`s Red, they also imports the operators…

[13:29] <guifa> SmokeMachine: the issue is that exported operators are limited to the lexical scope

[13:31] <SmokeMachine> guifa: yes, but the problem is fixed if you import the operator into the scope where you want to use it, right?!

[13:32] <guifa> SmokeMachine that assumes that you have control over those scopes

[13:32] <guifa> In tope#9134's case, there's no control over what Math::Vector imports into its scopes

[13:33] <SmokeMachine> But importing his module is a simple requirement for using his operators, isn’t it?

[13:35] <guifa> Yes, it would be — but since tope didn't write Math::Vector, there's no simple way to inject the use statement there

[13:36] <SmokeMachine> Or tope#9134 could even make the module export the operator AND Math::Vector, that way a user would only need to `use` that module

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> my assumption was just that Math::Vector and Math::Matrix would be able to do vector/matrix stuff irregardless of the base ring/field that the elements I gave. like if I'm calculating a dot product, I don't care if I'm working with floats, Int, int-modulo-257, even polynomials or matrices over yet another ring, so long as those elements _are rings_ (that is, they have + - * and so on with the usual laws 

[13:38] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> kind of like typeclasses in Haskell I guess

[13:40] <guifa> SmokeMachine Even in that case, Math::Vector will still not have access to the new operator within its routines.  If Math::Vector has `sub double($a) is export { $a + $a }`, and I have in my code `double FancyMathClass.new()`, it won't catch my operator for FancyMathClass, it'll call .Numeric on it instead and use standard math

[13:49] <guifa> tope#9134, try this: role ZIntAddition { my &original = &infix:<+>.clone; multi method CALL-ME (ZInt $, ZInt $) { 'special' }; multi method CALL-ME (|c) { original |c } }; &infix:<+> does ZIntAddition;

[13:50] <guifa> you can use original($a, $b) to call the original, unmodified addition

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> uhh, hang on, what... if I do:

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> my $vec1 = Math::Vector($arr1);

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> my $vec2 = Math::Vector($arr2);

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> "$vec1 - $vec2 = {$vec1 - $vec2} (mod {$F.modulus}) <--- ????".say;

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> it gives me: `(50, 100, 19, 69) - (11, 121, 21, 100) = (39, -21, -2, -31) (mod 131) <--- ????`

[13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> which is wrong, it's just using regular Int arithmetic

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> BUT, if I manually use my own `-` first:

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> my $vec1 = Math::Vector($arr1);

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> my $vec2 = Math::Vector($arr2);

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> "wc: $vec1 - $vec2 = vs<{$vec1.coordinates »-« $vec2.coordinates}> (mod {$F.modulus})".say;

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> "$vec1 - $vec2 = {$vec1 - $vec2} (mod {$F.modulus}) <--- ????".say;

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> it produces:

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> wc: (50, 100, 19, 69) - (11, 121, 21, 100) = vs<39 110 129 100> (mod 131)

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> (50, 100, 19, 69) - (11, 121, 21, 100) = (39, 110, 129, 100) (mod 131) <--- ????

[13:52] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> ```

[13:53] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> suddenly Math::Vector produces the correct result, why? no other changes in code, just inserting that line

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> I mean this is with the original solution of just using implementing the arithmetic on my side with `multi sub infix:<+>( ... ) { ... }` etc

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> I mean this is with the original solution of just implementing the arithmetic on my side with `multi sub infix:<+>( ... ) { ... }` etc

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> without any of the role/wrap magic

[13:57] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> is there some kind of uhh hotloading of the operators into a cache that then gets used?

[14:01] <guifa> tope: it's possible.  We're getting into stuff beyond my paygrade, but infix:<+> and kin are listed as pure, so there's the possibility of some optimization going on that's mucking with stuff. 

[14:11] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> hehe, all I ever wanted was to maybe write some libraries for number theory stuff *sob*, but 3 or 4 days in and I'm close to despair. I thought this oughtn't be that hard, esp in such a highly extensible language. finite fields and modular arithmetic are after all at the very heart of most cryptography primitives, from RSA to elliptic curves to NTRU.

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> maybe I could post a longer writeup somewhere, giving full implementations in Python which I actually know, asking for translations or equivalences. cause I reckon I'm still lost on 90% of the stuff that might be possible

[14:15] <discord-raku-bot> <tope#9134> I'll try this `does ROLE` + `.clone original` idea too

[15:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@93032313142669312>  The Raku matrix functionalities are not that great. Useful, but still too basic. I am interested in symbolic computations, but those are not high in my priorities list. Getting Raku to have sparse matrix algebra support is of much higher priority for me.

[15:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@93032313142669312> If use Linux take a look at `Math::Libgsl::Matrix` and `Math::Libgsl::Vectors` :  https://github.com/frithnanth/raku-Math-Libgsl-Matrix .

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Hi, I'm using zef command for first time. It just hangs when I do `zef search WWW`

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I'm on a mac. Is the service down?

[16:53] <guifa> steveid: it works for me (I'm on Monterey)

[16:54] <guifa> does zef work for you otherwise?  (sometimes gatekeeper can be....overzealous in blocking stuff IME)

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm Big Sur

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i tried --help and --version. those commands work

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> if I do `zef search wWW` with the typo i get `===> Found 0 results`

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I installed with homebrew

[16:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `zef list` works

[16:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> huh, `zef search` just started working for me now

[16:58] * guifa 's spell worked

[16:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> must have been a temporary glitch

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> hmm, seems very flaky. just hangs with `zef search Mac`

[17:01] <guifa> maybe your system has gremlins lol.  that one returned pretty fast for me

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> same problem with my other machine

[17:06] <guifa> actually I just got it to do that for me as well.  I just pinged the developer of zef on the main channel to see if I can get you any more info

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks. and why does it say you are a bot? I'm confused?

[17:12] <guifa> I'm on IRC, and you're on Discord

[17:12] <guifa> the bot passes messages between the two

[17:12] <guifa> (you also show up as a bot to me hahaha)

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ah, very cool

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I feel like I'm living in the 21st century finally. 🙂

[17:27] <guifa> stevied: I just got a response, he said likely one of the ecosystems it searches is stalling

[17:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks. I'll just wait it out. I wasn't sure if the website docs were out of date or what.

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so I'd like to get contribute a very simple module to get my feet wet with raku. is there an account I have to get to do that like with cpan?

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, nvm, found it in the docs: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Distributing_modules

[17:33] <guifa> Yes, but they can be very informal.  There's CPAN and p6c that you find there.  p6c is just you have a github repository and you submit a pull request adding a link to it  

[17:34] <guifa> Also new is fez and that's probably where most modules will go down the line.  See https://raku-advent.blog/2021/12/23/day-23-the-life-of-raku-module-authoring/

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, this is basically just a toy module. I guess using pf6 would be the way to go

[17:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> all it does is find and list applications on a mac

[17:41] <guifa> Little modules like that are very useful

[18:04] <thowe> I figured out how to type those corner brackets :)

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone have any idea why a blank line in a module would cause it to hang? seems like a bug.

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I must be doing something wrong.

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this is the module:

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> use v6;

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> unit module Mac::Applications::List;

[19:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> my $x = '3';

[19:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> when I try to load it, it just hangs

[19:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> if I get rid of the blank like, it doesn't hang

[19:21] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> hmmm, doesn't appear to be just a blank line that causes the problem. if there is a trailing space at the end of the line, it's breaking things. very weird. not sure what is causing things to hang.

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> It's really weird, if I make minor adjustments to code, the module can just hang. no idea what's going on. file encoding is set to utf-8

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> adding a blank line can break it

[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> sometimes adding a blank line will get it working again. wtf?

[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm on an m1, can that make a difference?

[19:41] <MasterDuke> does adding RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 to the environment make a difference

[19:41] <MasterDuke> oh, how recent is your rakudo?

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> just downloaded it yesterday with homebrew

[19:48] <MasterDuke> -v says it's 2021.12?

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> raku -v

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Welcome to Rakudo(tm) v2021.04.

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Implementing the Raku(tm) programming language v6.d.

[19:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Built on MoarVM version 2021.04

[19:50] <MasterDuke> that's a bit old. i don't use macos, but maybe the section here https://rakudo.org/downloads has something newer you can use?

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> let me try on the docker image. I'll see if I can reproduce there

[19:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so I've got an older version looks like?

[19:50] <MasterDuke> yeah, there have been some large changes/improvements since then

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> alright, i'll give that a shot. thanks.

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, @MasterDuke, things seem to be working now

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> nice

[20:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> there is a bug in the set-env script for macs, though

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's looking for grep in the /bin/grep directory on a mac

[20:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> that doesn't exist, though

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> which repo to I report that issue to?
