[16:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> Super newb question, but I installed zef and am getting command not found. Do I need to add something to my bashrc file?

[16:49] <nikhil> I am unable to install rakudoc.... Can anyone please suggest what to do next? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/JvKcSexu/image.png

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> On what operating system? Did you use rakubrew or used Rakudo tar file?

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> I'm on a mac. I used rakubrew.

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> M1 Mac.

[17:08] <CIAvash> if you installed rakudo with rakubrew, you can install zef with it as well, `rakubrew build-zef`

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> i ran that, but the commnad still isn't there.

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> So I think zef is installed but maybe not on my $PATH or something.

[17:13] <CIAvash> run `rakubrew init` for instructions

[17:21] <CIAvash> If you ran `rakubrew build-zef` you should see something like `1 bin/ script [zef] installed to: ~/.raku/bin`

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> I got it working.

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Chlorokin#6581> Thanks

[17:28] <CIAvash> I think after you add the eval line, you open a new terminal/shell to see its effect. or run `eval "$(/usr/bin/rakubrew init Zsh)"` manually
