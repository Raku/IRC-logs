[19:35] <Guest11> sub finish(@data, @ops) {

[19:35] <Guest11>         my @nums = @data.map: *.made;

[19:35] <Guest11>         my $result = @nums.shift;

[19:35] <Guest11>         oper(~@ops.shift, $result, @nums.shift)

[19:35] <Guest11>         while @nums;

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hello. Where did you find this? Also, could you send it in a file? (github gist, pastebin etc)
