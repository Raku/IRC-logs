[00:22] <habere-et-disper> Welcome to Rakudo™ v2022.12.

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> Built on MoarVM version 2022.12.

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> I ran into a problem while trying to set up Readline: ===SORRY!===

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> Failed to get the directory contents of '/usr/local/opt/readline/lib': Failed to open dir: No such file or directory

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> Falling back to Linenoise (if present)

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> ```

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> ```bash

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> $ zef list --installed | grep Readline

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> Readline:ver<0.1.6>:auth<cpan:fooist

[00:22] <habere-et-disper> ```

[00:29] <jaguart> maybe zef install --force-install Readline ?

[00:35] <jaguart> installed modules get precompiled and end up in sha1 named places like: find ~ -ls | grep Readline

[00:36] <jaguart> ===> /home/jeff/.zef/store/perl6-readline/A01FED661682F6E510445205CBD1F5A540B19198/lib/Readline.pm

[00:37] <habere-et-disper> Uninstall and reinstall shows the cause:

[00:37] <habere-et-disper> [Readline] ===SORRY!===

[00:37] <habere-et-disper> [Readline] On macOS Perl6::Readline requires installing Readline via Homebrew

[00:37] <jaguart> :)

[00:56] <habere-et-disper> Thanks @jaguart. Brew failed to install readline with:

[00:56] <habere-et-disper> Warning: Refusing to link macOS provided/shadowed software: readline

[00:56] <habere-et-disper> Then I realized it was installed via nix, added another directory to the nix lib path and it works!

[16:17] <asarch> From: https://modules.raku.org/dist/Gnome::Gtk3:cpan:MARTIMM in the example code there is: my Gnome::Gtk3::Main $m .= new; What does .= mean?

[22:55] <lizmat> asarch: my Foo $bar .= new;  is the same as   my Foo $bar = Foo.new

[22:56] <lizmat> it allows you to not have to repeat the "Foo" if you want to constrain the type in the variable
