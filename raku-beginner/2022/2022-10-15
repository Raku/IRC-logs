[07:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > Also, in the absence of another sigil, :: can serve as its own sigil indicating intentional use of a not-yet-declared package name

[07:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> sounds correct-ish but ::?CLASS is arguably not a package name?

[07:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> it's a hardcoded symbol in rakudo. `?` pops up as a twigil in constants, like `$?BITS`

[07:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> it's a symbol in rakudo. `?` pops up as a twigil in constants, like `$?BITS`

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think :: also shows up at parametrized roles

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> type captures? `::T`

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> even with the explanation provided, it's hard to see them as "dummy package separators"

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yep

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and ::?CLASS seems like the same case

[07:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I started to think this :: is some sort of type sigil
