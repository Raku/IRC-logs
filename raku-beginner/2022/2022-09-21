[01:59] <discord-raku-bot> <masukomi> can anyone point me to a working command line tool that accesses a file in `%?RESOURCES` I've read all the docs i could find and i can't figure out how to make `%?RESOURCES` _not_ be `Nil` (yes i defined it in my meta6 and it is an array that contains something).

[02:14] <discord-raku-bot> <masukomi> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èfiiinaly figured it out. Needs like big-ol-explicit ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS DOESN'T WORK EXCEPT IN A MODULE/CLASS ‚ö†Ô∏è things. Yes it's mentioned, but it always feels like an throw away comment in passing, and it's  so non-sensical seeming that you'd have to make a module just to access a _global_ compile time variable.

[07:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> On the other hand, I feel there's so much wrong with your assumptions. Resources are for modules - moreover META6.json itself is for modules and I doubt it does anything if you just run a Raku script

[07:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> There are global compile-time variables that the Raku compiler itself sets

[08:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know, this really seems like node and package.json. Node in itself won't do anything based on package.json. Here, there is more native integration of packaging and compilation but at the end of the day, it's still two different things. A script run out of the blue does nothing about its own deployment. That's what I do with a script I made for work - I don't even do dependency management, I just
