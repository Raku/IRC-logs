[20:19] <defaultxr> hi. why does the repl echo back strings without quotes? it seems kind of unintuitive to me since it makes it impossible to differentiate glance between ["foo", "bar"] and ["foo bar"] at a glance. is there some way to make it include quotes?

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think it uses the textual representation by default

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you could use dd

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or .raku on the thing you want to log

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> m: dd ["foo", "bar"]

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> generally if I want to just get something back, I go like <expression> andthen .raku

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> andthen has very low precedence

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and it sets the LHS to the topic variable so .raku will act upon that

[20:25] <defaultxr> thanks. i am aware of the .raku method; i guess my question is more whether there a way to make it print the literal representation by default? i personally can't imagine ever preferring the textual representation when i'm writing code

[20:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I wouldn't be surprised if something like that existed but I've never seen anything like that

[22:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> defaultxr: you can try setting environment variable `RAKU_REPL_OUTPUT_METHOD` to `raku`

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> it comes closer but the `repl-print`'s signature has `$value` so arrays are printed with $ in front of them due to containerization I guess

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> perhaps `repl-print` might switch to `\value` in its signature? but idk the implications enough to say if it will break things

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> perhaps `repl-print` might switch to `\value` in its signature? but idk the implications enough to say if it will break things or will it work at all

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> no, `\value` doesn't work

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> no, `\value` doesn't make the difference

[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <mightgrabacoffee#3849> When FIRST is ran using 'filename.csv'.IO.lines in a for loop, its stars on init... so does that mean I will the first line, then the for loop will read the first line again?

[23:36] <defaultxr> Nahita: thank you, that's definitely much better! the dollar sign on arrays is fine, i mostly just want to avoid being confused by the output

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita#3882> you're welcome
