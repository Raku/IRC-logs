[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> got this regex: `$url ~~ s/(.*)\&t\=(\d+)s/?$0=$1/;`

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it throws an error: `Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value`

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> no idea why

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> where does `$url` come from?

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's passed into the function

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> sub get_youtube_embed($url) {

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     $url ~~ /v\=(.*)/;

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     $url ~~ s/(.*)\&t\=(\d+)s/?$0=$1/;

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> <snip>

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[23:44] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> `is copy` might help

[23:46] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> shit. seriously? perl has fucked me up for working with raku

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> Not your fault. We keep using the term "variable" while we only got containers and values.

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, i haven't wrapped my head around that yet. i'll probably have to make the same mistake 1000 times before I do

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> my term:<$not-a-container> := 42;

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> say "$not-a-container";

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> $no-a-container = 'answer';

[23:50] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> constant term:<$not-a-container> = 42;

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> say "$not-a-container";

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> $no-a-container = 'answer';

[23:51] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[23:52] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I had to take a few weeks break from raku, probably brain dumped half of what I learned in the first month

[23:52] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> That helped me understand what is going in. We see symbols that may be bound to containers or values but not both.

[23:52] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> remembering it again will help reinforce it
