[09:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there some built-in parseable complex number syntax?

[10:08] <lizmat> m: say i

[10:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´0+1i‚ê§¬ª

[10:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh

[10:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> 'i' doesn't parse as Complex but '1i' does

[10:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> from string that is

[10:31] <lizmat> m: dd <i>

[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´"i"‚ê§¬ª

[10:31] <lizmat> m: dd <1i>

[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´ComplexStr.new(<0+1i>, "1i")‚ê§¬ª

[10:31] <lizmat> hmmm

[10:31] <lizmat> m: dd &i'

[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Two terms in a row‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> dd &i‚èè'‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        infix‚ê§        infix stopper‚ê§        postfix‚ê§        statement end‚ê§        statement modifier‚ê§      ‚Ä¶¬ª

[10:32] <lizmat> m: dd &i

[10:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§¬ª

[10:32] <lizmat> m: dd i.^name

[10:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar dbf035d83: OUTPUT: ¬´"Complex"‚ê§¬ª

[10:32] <lizmat> m: dd &term<i>

[10:32] <lizmat> hmmm

[10:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there something odd going on?

[10:56] <lizmat> well, I sorta assumed that a bare i would be handled by a sub term<i> somewhere, but apparently it is handled in the grammar / actions

[17:08] <jgaz> I'm trying to import a rakumod I wrote into my main project code and it's not working. `use myModuleName;` isn't working. I get undeclared routine errors because the functions in that module aren't available to the rest of my code.

[17:09] <jgaz> I'm confused. I even tried `use ./module.rakumod` etc., no joy.

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> did you install it with zef?

[17:12] <jgaz> No, it's just Raku without zef.

[17:13] <jgaz> It should work without zef, right? It's just a rakumod file in my source directory.

[17:13] <jgaz> In Perl `use` "just works" without CPAN.

[17:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wonder how much "Raku without zef" is a thing

[17:15] <jgaz> It's a thing on Gentoo. I haven't gotten around to writing  a zef ebuild. :-/

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't use Perl but CPAN seemed more like the repository than the module building tool

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> one can use zef without any repository to back it up - and since modules are precompiled, something needs to be done, other than naming a plain raku source X.rakumod

[17:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not super knowledgeable with this stuff but it seems an unorthodox thing to do at the very least

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> jgaz: you don't need zef to `use YourModule` you have locally. To use the routines you declared in that module, however, they either need to be exported via, e.g., `is export` trait in which case you directly do `your-routine();` in the main code, and/or you make them `our` scoped in which case you do `YourModule::your-routine();` in your main code

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay but this goes beyond "locally", right? it's more like, if you are right in the same package

[17:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> they said they get "undeclared routine" errors instead of "module not found", so i assumed that far

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> then let's say this is an "internal module" üòÑ

[17:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> anyway, now that we are at it - what is visible to a raku file simply based on location?

[17:24] <jgaz> Well, I was expecting the local source directory to be visible.

[17:25] <jgaz> Nahita: Where is the documentation on the is inport trate?

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> even the current directory isn't looked for; need `use lib ".";`

[17:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> jgaz: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Exporting_and_selective_importing is a source

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> https://docs.raku.org/routine/is%20export the direct ref but above is more useful together i think

[17:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nahita> here's another one, also useful on the topic https://docs.raku.org/language/module-packages

[17:35] <jgaz> Thanks all.
