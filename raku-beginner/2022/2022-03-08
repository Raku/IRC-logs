[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> trying to use a perl5 module in raku:

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> use Lingua::En::Titlecase:from<Perl5>;

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> my $tc = Lingua::EN::Titlecase.new("CAN YOU FIX A TITLE?");

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> but get an error:

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Could not find symbol ''&Titlecase'' in ''GLOBAL::Lingua::EN''

[06:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[06:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> not sure what the problem is. the second line is right from the module documentation

[09:07] <ychaouche> hello raku gurus

[09:07] <ychaouche> quick question : in raku, can you have %foo and $foo be two different things in the same program ? 

[09:08] <ychaouche> same name referencing two things based on used sigils

[09:10] <MasterDuke> yeah, they're completely separate

[09:10] <ychaouche> MasterDuke: do you confirm you can have both in same program, at the same time ? 

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Lol

[09:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I confirm! :DD

[09:11] <MasterDuke> m: my $foo = "yes"; my %foo = %("no" => 0, "yes" => 1); say %foo{$foo}

[09:15] <ychaouche> it seems I'm missing all the fun at the discord server

[09:20] *** discord-raku-bot left
[09:21] <gfldex> bridge is down for a few minutes

[09:31] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[09:31] <gfldex> bridge is up again

[09:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> thank you^^

[09:35] <ychaouche> oh, screencasts
