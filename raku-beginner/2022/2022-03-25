[00:29] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, got another little question. I want to do something like this: `method new(%args) `

[00:31] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> where the signature is "autovivified" for lack of a better word, when I pass arguments to it

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so I'd have something like this:

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     method new(%args) {

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>         %args<input_file>.IO.e ?? self.IO::Path::new(%args<input_file>)!SET-SELF()

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>                    !! die "%args<input_file> is not a file";

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     }

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[00:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> not sure if this is possible with new new constructor

[00:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> nice, worked with no problem

[01:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what's everyone using for something similar to Lof4Perl?

[03:12] <guifa_> stevied: how are you passing the arguments?

[03:13] <guifa_> %args will be defined, but empty

[03:13] <guifa_> (assuming no arguments passed)

[03:13] <guifa_> If you pass anything that's Associative, then %args will become that thing

[03:14] <guifa_> If you're wanting to be able to say .new(a => 4, b => 6), then you'd probably want a slurpy (that is, method new (*%args) { … } )

[03:15] <guifa_> If you want to be able to handle .new('a', 4, 'b', 6), then you're best bet is to make it a multi method, with one capturing a positional slurpy, and redispatching to your single argument %args

[03:16] <guifa_> e.g. multi method new (*@args) { samewith Hash.new: |@args }
