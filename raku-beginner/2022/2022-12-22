[01:26] <deoac> `Term::ReadKey` doesn't behave like the documentation claims.  It doesn't respond to a key-press.  It responds after you hit `enter`. .  Is there another module that doesn't require the `enter`. ?

[09:47] <lizmat> Nemokosch indeed

[09:48] <lizmat> and @foo.splice; in sink context is a faster way to do @foo = ()    :-)

[09:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Gotcha, thanks
