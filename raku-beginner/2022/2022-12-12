[22:19] <habere-et-disper> Can I use `m: ...` here to test an older version of the compiler?

[22:20] <habere-et-disper> Specifically, 2022-07

[22:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> not sure, however there are other bots that might help with that

[22:25] <habere-et-disper> I have what seems a possible bug in 2022-07 and I'd like to confirm it. It works fine in 2022-12.

[22:27] <Nemokosch> in that case, bisectable6 might be your biggest help

[22:27] <Nemokosch> it lives on #raku

[22:36] <habere-et-disper> Thanks!
