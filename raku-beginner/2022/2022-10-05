[01:45] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Can I read Raku doc (e.g. https://rakudocs.github.io/routine/subst) from command line?

[01:46] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Search and browse is what I've in mind, better still if it's integrated with editor/IDE

[02:05] <MasterDuke> there is the rakudoc program, but it needs some fixing, it might not be in a working state right now

[02:22] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Hmmm, indeed it is broken, can't even be installed with `zef`

[02:22] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Thanks, will stick to the web interface for the time being

[03:32] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Another question, there is nowhere in the *regex* doc saying that `{expression}` will be evaluated, is this an error in the doc or in rakudo?

[07:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what is the actual behavior?

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> I believe it can evaluate arbitrary code in `{}`. E.g.

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> ```raku

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> use v6.d;

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> my $count = 0;

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> my $str = "1, 2, 3, 4";

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> if $str ~~ / [\d+ {$count++; say "Found $count digit" } \D*]+ / {

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque>     say "There are $count digits in total";

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> }

[08:03] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> ```

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Output:

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> ```

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Found 1 digit

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Found 2 digit

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Found 3 digit

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Found 4 digit

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> There are 4 digits in total

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> ```

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh I didn't read it right, so you are saying that this is undocumented

[08:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that's quite possible

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Ya, couldn't found it in the doc, that's why I'm asking

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> happens quite often...

[08:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's a bit like, assumed that you'd automagically know it üòÇ

[08:08] *** dakkar joined
[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but yeah this is definitely a feature

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Exactly, would prefer it to be mentioned explicitly in the docs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[08:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the docs is always work in progress

[08:12] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> So... I guess the fault is in the fault and not in Rakudo üòÇ

[08:12] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> So... I guess the fault is in the doc and not in Rakudo üòÇ

[08:14] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> I'll file an issue at Github then, thanks!

[08:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Try to think about where you would like to see it

[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The only certainty is what we do ourselves, maybe I can get to it and make a PR

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Oh, just file the issue, didn't think about it from PR point of view

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4112

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Oh, just filed the issue, didn't think about it from PR point of view

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> It's sort of related to this section: https://rakudocs.github.io/language/regexes#Regex_interpolation

[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> Because here are the descriptions of `$var`, `$(code)`, `<$variable>`, `<{code}>`.

[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> So the syntax of `{expression}` is may be related here

[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> However, its behaviour is different because `{expression}` is not about regex interpolation, more like side-effect execution of code

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yep

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> I don't think it fits into any existing section for that matter

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> So probably put it under the first section: https://rakudocs.github.io/language/regexes#Lexical_conventions

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <zacque> So the syntax of `{expression}` may be related here
