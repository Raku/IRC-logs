[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm looking at https://docs.raku.org/language/exceptions#Catching_exceptions

[17:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what is that `:trying("zombie copy")` bit?

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> and why is a period tacked on to the front of that message

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it just assumes, you are describing a method?

[17:28] <lizmat> it;s just a named arg to the exception class

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, but I don't understand why it assumes the first word in the message is a method by throwing a dot in front of it

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> just seems kind of weird

[17:32] <lizmat> I'm not sure which dot you're referring to?

[17:35] *** wingfold left
[17:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> in the output: `# OUTPUT: Â«Failed to find 'foo/bar' while trying to do '.zombie copy' `

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> that argument is just an arbitrary string, right? doesn't have to contain a method call, does it?

[17:37] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this is all the documentation has on it: https://docs.raku.org/type/X::IO::DoesNotExist#___top

[17:43] <lizmat> aaaah..... ok

[17:43] <lizmat> yeah, in normal usage, that exception *is* called with a method name

[17:43] <lizmat> so that example basically is not so good  :-(

[17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, yeah, I'm like what the hell is "zombie"?

[17:44] <lizmat> yeah... perhaps make a doc issue for it

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> k

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so basically I think documentation for the trying method is needed

[17:58] <lizmat> but there is no trying method

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm lost. what's this? https://docs.raku.org/type/X::IO::DoesNotExist#method_trying

[18:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@563790557831495691> .trying is the public accessor to an attribute in X::IO::DoesNotExist .

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok. and what type is that accessor? some magic container or something?

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Exception.pm6#L670

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so it doesn't look like "X::IO::DoesNotExist" runs any kind of method AFAICT

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> method on the string passed to it, I mean

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> It will call `.Str` in the string substitution.

[18:25] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so what's the point of throwing the `.` in front of it?

[18:26] <lizmat> that exception is thrown inside IO::Path I believe, and then the method name is passed along

[18:26] <lizmat> see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/IO/Path.pm6#L756

[18:26] <lizmat> and then https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/IO/Path.pm6#L747

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> By convention `$.trying` is meant to contain a method name.

[18:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks. will take a look when I get a chance. gotta run.

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> is there an easy way to migrate modules after upgrading rakudo star?

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is rakudo star still relevant at all?

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's kind of strange we hear about it so often when it's virtually abandoned from what I know ðŸ¤”

[21:39] <drakonis> rakubrew's the current good option

[21:39] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> abandoned? really?

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm using the binary looks like, actually. not rakudo star bundle

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i thought they were the same but apparently not
