[05:26] <jaguart> @lizmat - thank you! Do you have any info/pointers on the required api/setup on the server side?... I will see if I can find any, but pointers appreciated

[07:33] <jaguart> Question on POD6 - is there a style guide? I know the Perlish recommendations - some of the Raku mods follow this and others dont?

[08:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> Hmmm I see some are ``=head1 NAME`` yet the docs speak of ``=NAME`` - guessing these are the same...

[08:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> but the recommended Perlish ones are not fully covered...

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> hmmm but while ``=NAME`` renders in Markdown, and Text - it doesn't render in HTML?

[09:50] <lizmat> jaguart: the URL should point at an endpoint producing a META file in the form of what is e.g. produced by https://360.zef.pm

[09:51] <lizmat> which is basically the JSON representation of an array of hashes, with each hash the META6.json contents of a distribution

[09:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> üëçüèº

[10:01] <jaguart> Thank you - I haven't dug further - being distracted by pod6... atm I assume that zef basically retrieves an archive/tar does a build/test to install, and fez does the opposite - ie archive/tar and store along with updated META6.json...

[10:02] <jaguart> I haven't quite figured out where everything actually ends up on the local file system. Assuming some index as I see lots of tmpdirs etc.

[10:04] <jaguart> Not quite clear on where the signing etc. is done to ensure security, though I did spot that fez contains register/ident/auth functionality.

[10:23] <lizmat> jaguart: atm, there's only ident/auth functionality on upload

[10:24] <lizmat> if we're talking MITM attacks on download, we're in quite a different realm, I'd say

[10:24] <lizmat> and for clarity: the META of each distribution in the META list, should contain a field "source-url" of where to fetch the tar file

[10:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> fab thank you - helps a lot üôÇ
