[02:16] <Guest26> Hello! I'm attempting to build a simple hello world for raku and compile it as a jar, but i'm gettin the error "Unknown compilation target 'jar'". I am compiling my code with "raku --target=jar test.raku". I am running this on macOS 12.4 (Monterrey) and installed raku via homebrew

[02:23] <Guest26> also, is there any documentation about raku-on-jvm generally? i have been struggling to find any

[18:00] <habere-et-disper> How do I make a grammar return False instead of Nil? Trying to catch it in `actions` is too late, and I don't know what method (or phaser?) to use to do this inside the grammar.

[18:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Just you `so`.

[18:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> E.g. `so Parser.parse('I love Croku')`.

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Just use  `so`.

[18:07] <habere-et-disper> The grammar is returning a bag, and an empty bag is valid too. So we have multiple falsy values that can be returned from the grammar. I only want complete grammar failure (ie Nil) to return False, everything else is fine to pass on.Â  I thought his would be easier to do inside the grammar?

[18:09] <habere-et-disper> I am using an action and .made so the grammar is returning useful things I don't want cast into Boolean.

[18:09] <habere-et-disper> (Unless Nil.)

[18:11] <habere-et-disper> I have it working with `.parse( $source, actions => ... ).made // False` and I'm wondering if that False bit could go into the grammar?

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Where I can see your code? Can you post it here? Is it in some repository?

[18:16] <habere-et-disper> Sure -- it's on Exercism. Thanks for taking a look -- I really appreciate it! :-)

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> I am sorry, I cannot copy-&-paste that code. Please post it here.

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does the argumentless flat do?

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> the args are on the next line

[19:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> no semicolon

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> no semicolon indeed but I wouldn't have expected this to be parsed like arguments

[19:08] <habere-et-disper> I know -- more raku magic!

[19:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know, I can't read those lines

[19:13] <habere-et-disper> It's the algorithm for calculating the isbn, which is taking the digits from the grammmar. There are two cases: straight ten digits, or nine with an X which we have to turn into a ten.

[19:20] <habere-et-disper> It's the `// False` bit at the end that I thought I could add to the grammar with a method. I'm adjusting the code from the book I have _Raku Fundamentals_. You can read that approach here:

[19:20] <habere-et-disper> https://github.com/Apress/raku-fundamentals/blob/master/chapter-09-parsing-ini/09.p6

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> are you sure you want Z* ?

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I don't know. Overall, the whole code is unrelatable for me. I think I also tried this task a while back, and I concluded I didn't want to do tasks that are improperly specified yet expect you to match their vague testing.

[20:01] <habere-et-disper> I'm keen to hear about alternative approaches. What do you suggest in place of Z*?

[20:02] <habere-et-disper> How can I make this more relatable?

[20:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> No idea, to be honest. I don't know what this is meant to be, and I remember I was absolutely dissatisfied with the specification of the task anyway.

[20:11] <habere-et-disper> I have found it trying too. It's not setup for the beginner and that's where I'd like to see fundamental changes into a somatic approach to programming. Has anyone experienced dynamicland?

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @habere-et-disper Thanks for asking the ISBN grammar questions. I used that grammar to make test for my random sentence generator.

[20:16] <habere-et-disper> You're welcome ! :)  What does your random sentence generator look like?
