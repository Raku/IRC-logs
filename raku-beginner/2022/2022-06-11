[13:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> How can make a test that (i) passes if a certain package P1 cannot be loaded, and (ii) if P1 can be loaded, then applies a certain "typical" test?

[17:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how can I pause program execution and require user to "hit any key" to continue?

[17:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> got it. getc()

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> https://gist.github.com/sdondley/6ac51bb98c8f571f71e1543fc40f0d7e

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> made a little tutorial for the basics of lists

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> <@563790557831495691> Can access this page: https://antononcube.shinyapps.io/DSL-evaluations/ ?

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Please try this command : 

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> ```

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> DSL MODULE DataQuery;

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> take elements from 32 to 84

[17:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> ```

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> spits out `dplyr::slice(32:84)`

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> This R -- please select Raku

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I will review the DSL parse to be able to do all of the examples in your gist.

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I get: `$obj = $obj[ (32 - 1) ... (84 - 1 ) ]`

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I will review the DSL parser to be able to do all of the examples in your gist.

[17:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what does this do, allow you to translate a special DSL to code in different languages?

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Correct -- the idea is to generate code for different systems (languages + libraries) from the same specialized natural language DSL.

[17:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> you are working on this from scratch?

[17:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> With Raku, yes. In Mathematica I use a different approach.

[17:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Last year I made this demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1lqMDdeIY

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> very interesting

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so is the goal to be able to query the website using natural language?

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yes, but not just the website. I mostly use the code generation through CLI. For example:

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> ```

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> > ToDataQueryWorkflowCode Raku 'use the data table $dfTemp; group by Var1; show counts; ungroup; rename Var1 as VAR01'

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> # $obj = $dfTemp ;

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> # $obj = group-by( $obj, "Var1") ;

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> # say "counts: ", $obj>>.elems ;

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> # $obj = $obj.values.reduce( -> $x, $y { [|$x, |$y] } ) ;

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> # $obj = rename-columns( $obj, %("Var1" => "VAR01") )

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> ```

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> The thing is, that list manipulation is relatively new addition to the data wrangling DSL and it most likely needs more attention.

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so you want to be able to create/manipulate Lists using the DSL?

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Correct. (Some of that is already implemented...)

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how do you do the natural language processing, just using Grammars? Or is there some kind AI component to it?

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how do you do the natural language processing, just using Grammars? Or is there some kind of AI component to it?

[18:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I personally am more interested in the "inverse problem" -- say from Raku code to generate English descriptions. (Again, gist like yours help...)

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I have two solutions: 1) "just" with Raku Grammars, and 2) using neural-network based Question Answering System (QAS) in Mathematica.

[18:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I personally am more interested in the "inverse problem" -- say from Raku code to generate English descriptions. (Again, gists like yours help...)

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, I plan on doing more of these gists. mostly just for myself to help solidify my knowledge of Raku and as notes that I can execute and experiment with

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> The QAS-approach is much easier to program, but it is too slow and imprecise. So, some balance / collaboration has to be done between Grammar and QAS

[18:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> The QAS-approach is much easier to program, but it is too slow and imprecise. So, some balance / collaboration has to be done between Grammar and QAS.

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Great. One of the main goals of these code generations is exactly that -- to get quickly around language/library idiosyncrasies using "just technological  thinking."

[18:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I.e. using natural language commands.

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Actually, what you trying to do can fit the QAS approach. Imagine you can give commands like "Show a Raku example of replacing an element in a list."

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Or, "How do I specify multi-dimensional arrays in Raku."

[18:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Or, "How do I specify multi-dimensional arrays in Raku?"

[18:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, I will be putting in examples/recipes for those kinds of frequently used idioms

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm going to write a simple little grammar for parsing a file with the code samples and the description of what the code does. most of them will come right from the Raku docs website

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hopefully, I am not overestimating you curiosity here... Please see the questions and answers after the text from your gist.

[18:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> BTW, `FindTextualAnswer` on the AI-side, it neural-networks based.

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> BTW, `FindTextualAnswer` is on the AI-side, it neural-networks based.

[18:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> BTW, `FindTextualAnswer` is on the AI-side, it is neural-networks based.

[18:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> that's very cool and amazing

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> the last one is slightly wrong because my notes are wrong. they don't "become" positional. they are already positional.

[18:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hopefully, I am not overestimating your curiosity here... Please see the questions and answers after the text from your gist.

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yeah, it is wrong -- that is general case with neural-network QAS. It is "just" a statistical heuristic.

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Hence, breed special and corner cases.

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> alright, well, I'll keep plugging away at this. i'll turn it into a proper repo

[18:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'll let you know when I've made more progress with less trivial examples.
