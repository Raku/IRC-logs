[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> right, hyper stuff will thread itself which makes it faster but you lose some ordering guarantees during processing even though it'll come out in the right order ultimately

[01:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> race is similar doesn't even guarantee that stuff comes out in the same order

[19:14] <Guest9360> Hi,

[19:14] <Guest9360> I'm trying to install Raku on Linux per the instructions outlined at https://raku.guide/#_installing_raku and it breaks on the final step.  I receive this message:  Can't open perl script "Configure.pl": No such file or directory.  Any suggestions?
