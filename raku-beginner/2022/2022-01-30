[03:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how do I generate a date like `January 29, 2022, 9:52 pm`

[03:30] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> not seeing anything in docs

[03:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> looks like I gotta go with a module? https://raku.land/zef:tbrowder/Date::Names

[03:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> don't see a way to do date format specifiers like %m etc.
