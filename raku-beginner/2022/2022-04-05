[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how do multis work when you hardcode the parameter value? What check happens on the actually passed value to determine if it matches?

[09:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> equivalence? smart-matching?

[09:10] <lizmat> the functional equivalent of smart-matching

[09:11] <lizmat> it tries to do short-cuts both at compile time as well as runtime

[09:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so, to double-check: if I have a clause for f(1) and my call is f('1'), it can dispatch to the f(1) call?

[18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Well IntStr inherits from Int

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay but I wonder what kind of check is performer

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay but I wonder what kind of check is performed

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because <1> !~~ 1

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> oops

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean <1> \~\~ 1 indeed but '1' ~~ 1 too

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and <1> !eqv 1

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Yeah hm

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I suspect itâ€™s a two-step thing

[18:06] *** wingfold left
[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Type match and then maybe ACCEPTS
