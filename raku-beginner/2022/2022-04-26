[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     my @texts = 'Javascript is lovely', 'Python is lovely', 'Raku is lovely';

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     my @lies = <Javascript Python>;

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     say @texts».match(/[ [ @lies && <?{ False }> || 'Raku' ] ' is lovely' ]/);

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[10:05] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@297037173541175296> does ^^^ this help?

[10:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Hm, maybe it does, I have to find a proper analogy of what I originally wanted to do

[11:03] <SmokeMachine> gfldex: would `<!>` instead of `<?{ False }>` work as well?

[11:06] <SmokeMachine> m: my @texts = 'Javascript is lovely', 'Python is lovely', 'Raku is lovely'; my @lies = <Javascript Python>; say @texts».match(/[ [ @lies && <!> || 'Raku' ] ' is lovely' ]/)

[11:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «[Nil Nil ｢Raku is lovely｣]␤»

[11:15] <SmokeMachine> m: my @texts = 'Javascript is lovely', 'Python is lovely', 'Raku is lovely'; my @lies = <Javascript Python>; say @texts».match(/^$<lang>=\w+ <?{ $<lang> ~~ @lies.none }> ' is lovely'$/)

[11:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «[Nil Nil ｢Raku is lovely｣␤ lang => ｢Raku｣]␤»

[14:13] <gfldex> SmokeMachine: Does <!> got a name? I'm asking because that's an ENODOC and needs filing.

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, why the outer branckets?

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> They are not needed in this example but I like to add grouping while I write a Regexp so I wont forget when I extend it.
