[20:09] <deoac> How and why were the names "Raku" and "zef" chosen?

[21:27] *** deoac left
[23:15] <guifa_> Raku was chosen because the primary compiler for then-Perl 6 was called "Rakudo". 

[23:16] <guifa_> zef, iirc, is just chosen because it's a short and pronounceable set of letters that was wasn't already taken haha
