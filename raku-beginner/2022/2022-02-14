[00:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> no information on your tab questions; but I've had issues using unicode in Comma.  Some stuff takes while other stuff won't (set theory commands).  I checked in Unicode libraries and there seems to be several different combinations often for different symbols.

[00:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> my guess is that Comma only accepts 1, but I'm not sure what's going on

[00:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> if you figure out a way to get Comma to accept "arbitrary Unicode" I'd appreciate it if you could @ me

[01:17] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> ah nevermind, I figured it out

[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> Comma settings are all in the same places they are in IntelliJ

[01:19] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> I was wondering why Comma had almost no documentation: it's the same program but modded for Raku

[03:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Does someone know of some tutorial on I/O?  I know of 2:

[03:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> https://raku.guide/#_io

[03:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> https://docs.raku.org/type/IO::Path

[03:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> But I'm having trouble figuring out the most basic bits.  I keep targeting paths and directories and its failing

[03:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I'll use "spurt" and I'll get an error message like:

[03:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> "Failed to open"

[03:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> "Actually thrown at:"

[03:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> or a couple dozen others

[03:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I'm just missing something pretty fundamental about how to target a some file or directory

[03:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I'm just missing something pretty fundamental about how to target some file or directory

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> "No such file or directory

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974>   in block <unit> at"

[03:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I get that even when copying the path directly from within the IDE

[03:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I think part of it is that I'm confused as to what is auto-defaulting to which directory.

[03:41] *** frost left
[03:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I understand I'm not giving anyone concrete code to analyze, part of that is that I've just tried a couple dozen things and it keeps not working; hence why I was curious if there is a better resource for learning about I/O

[03:46] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> did you forget the :w or :r argument?

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> are you using unix path notation?

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> path/to/file

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> relative to the .raku script

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> is how it goes, I think

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I did find a message that said in windows you've gotta change the path to \\

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> and I've been doing that

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> rather "\\"

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> ugh

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> double \

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> like this

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> C:\\Users\\Daniel\\CommaProjects\\

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> I did / for open today on windows, and it worked

[03:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> lol

[03:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> it won't take double slashes

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> and not from the drive

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> but its double

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> but from the folder where the script is

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> alright I'll try that

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> there's probably a way to specify absolute paths, but I'm not sure

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> I'm also a noob

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> there's probably also a way to specify absolute paths, but I'm not sure

[03:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> ultimately I'm trying to figure out how to write and read from text files

[03:51] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> meanwhile, I'm having trouble with typed parameters

[03:52] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> using ``sub Main (Int $arg)``  gives me a warning when I try to coerce ``$arg`` into a string to use in a qq

[03:54] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> ``Str($arg)``

[03:54] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> or

[03:54] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> ``~$arg``

[03:55] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> both give the same warning, and it just fails to do the coercion, and I get a blank where I should get a stringified number

[03:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I haven't done anything with coercion outside of the Raku beginner course.  I went through that, tried to memorize what I could and decided I should just start making programs and try to learn by solving along the way

[03:58] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> ``Use of uninitialized value $of type Mu in string context

[03:58] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> Methods  .name, .raku, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful``

[03:58] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> (ofc those methods don't actually work)

[03:58] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> yeah I have no idea how to do this

[04:00] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> I understand why I get a compilation error when I use ``~$arg``

[04:00] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> $arg is apparently ``Mu``, but ~ takes an ``Any``

[04:00] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> what I don't understand is why it's Mu

[04:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> yeah I have no idea how to do that either lol

[04:08] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> oh, I figured it out

[04:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> yeah I actually just wrote something to a textfile

[04:10] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> nice

[04:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> karma abounds

[04:11] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> yeah, assignment to a ``constant`` sigil freezes non-constant rvalue expressions

[04:12] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> they're not allowed to evaluate; they're just ignored if you use them in a " string

[04:13] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> you can't use anything that can't be known at compile time

[04:13] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> I thought ``constant`` literally just meant it doesn't change after assignment

[04:13] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> but it stricter, and less useful

[04:15] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> in fact, apparently it can be dangerous, because the value will not change after compilations

[04:15] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> ``constant comp-time = DateTime.now;`` freezes the value of comp-time to the initial moment this code was complied

[04:15] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> forever

[04:16] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> very insane behaviour

[04:23] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> but it's stricter, and less useful

[13:08] *** discord-raku-bot left
[13:08] *** discord-raku-bot joined
[14:03] <lizmat> well, I guess an empty "provides" and a filled "depends" with the dependencies ?

[14:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what are these?

[14:22] <lizmat> in the META6.json file ?

[14:23] * lizmat may have misunderstood the question

[14:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what is this ACTION you are always talking about ðŸ˜…

[14:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's okay, you just assumed I know more than I actually do

[14:27] <lizmat> perhaps App::Mi6 is a good helper for you

[14:27] <lizmat> mi6 new Module::Name 

[14:27] <lizmat> and you have just about all you need

[14:28] <lizmat> actually, if you want to use the zef ecosystem, you probably want:

[14:28] <lizmat> mi6 new Module::Name --fez

[14:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Is this error message because I'm trying to use a slurp a textfile (immutable?) to a SetHash (mutable)?
