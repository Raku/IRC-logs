[18:14] <helppls> Hey, I'm trying to create a simple interpreter in Raku, but I'm getting a weird output starting with: ´Żó and ending with ´Żú, for  example here:

[18:14] <helppls>  ´ŻóZmienna x wynosi 20. print x.´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>  statement => ´ŻóZmienna x wynosi 20´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>   var-declaration => ´ŻóZmienna x wynosi 20´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>    var-name => ´Żóx´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>    var-value => ´Żó20´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>  statement => ´Żóprint x´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>   func-call => ´Żóprint x´Żú

[18:14] <helppls>    var-name => ´Żóx´Żú

[18:14] <helppls> any ideas what could be causing this?

[18:16] <lizmat> feels like a weird form of mojibake ?

[18:21] <helppls> It seems like it shows even on simplest code like: my $prog = "my a = 10;";

[18:21] <helppls> grammar L {

[18:21] <helppls>     rule TOP{

[18:21] <helppls>         'my a = 10;'

[18:21] <helppls>     }

[18:21] <helppls> }

[18:21] <helppls> say L.parse($prog);

[18:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> huh, good luck to figure this one out... what system are you using?

[18:26] <helppls> win10

[18:27] <lizmat> helppls: fwiw, that code gives me: ｢my a = 10;｣

[18:28] <lizmat> as expected

[18:28] <lizmat> what does raku -v say?

[18:29] <helppls> Welcome to RakudoÔäó v2022.07.

[18:29] <helppls> Implementing the Raku┬« Programming Language v6.d.

[18:29] <helppls> Built on MoarVM version 2022.07.

[18:29] <lizmat> are you on Windows per chance ?

[18:29] <helppls> yes, windows 10

[18:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> windows 10 sounds like that

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> okay, this is definitely some encoding zalgo

[18:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> unicode displayed poorly

[18:30] <helppls> I suppose it could be only from the side of my termin, so I could ignore it for now and on different machine/vm it should be working just fine, right?

[18:31] <lizmat> it should

[18:31] <helppls> Okay, thank you very much guys :)

[18:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> maybe even a change in the terminal or another terminal could help on it

[18:34] <helppls> Ok, after some time figuring it out I will just opt to ignore it for now though, thanks!
