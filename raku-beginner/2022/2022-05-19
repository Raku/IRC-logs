[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it took some time until this has become relevant again

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and I have to say no, it doesn't help

[10:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The trick in your example is that you do know that you want to match 'Raku' so it's a bit like "what has four legs, is a table and not a chair"

[10:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in the current case, I'd like to match _anything_ that contains 'executable' but is not preceded by the word 'text'

[10:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> in fact a simple <!after 'text'> should do in this case but it doesn't help for some reason

[10:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay I think I found my mistake

[10:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, it doesn't change the fact that the given example didn't really demonstrate how to match "neither this nor that" ðŸ˜…
