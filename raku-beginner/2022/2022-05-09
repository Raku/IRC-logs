[21:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Is there a nicer way to add the same value to several hash keys than to copy it enough times using the xx operator?

[21:17] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> Does setting the default do what you want? https://docs.raku.org/type/Hash#method_default

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't think so

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm thinking of "bulk setting" values because I know they will be the same

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and Raku actually allows setting multiple values at once but then the RHS also needs to have multiple values

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so I end up with something like

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> %hash{@keys} = value xx +@keys

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> that looks reasonable to me

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> > and Raku actually allows setting multiple values at once but then the RHS also needs to have multiple values

[21:22] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> TIL

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> does `%hash{@keys} = value xx *` work?

[21:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hmm

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> o.O it does

[21:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> nice ðŸ™‚ Thank you

[21:46] <discord-raku-bot> <at#0754> no problem!
