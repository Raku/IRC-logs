[00:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> didn't fix one of the bugs I was having: todo comments not showing up in todo list with raku files. It works with an html file, though

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> how would you check if a number is a square number?

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is `sqrt($x) %% 1` a good idea?

[12:03] <lizmat> m: dd sqrt(4).narrow ~~ Int

[12:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: ¬´Bool::True‚ê§¬ª

[12:03] <lizmat> m: dd sqrt(5).narrow ~~ Int

[14:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I have an attribute in a class that is a Str called $!content

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I want to be able to do something like: $!content.capitalize-headers on it to transform it

[14:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how do I make the capitalize-headers method looks like it's a method of a Str object?

[14:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I guess I'd have to make $!content a new kind of object that is a subclass of Str.

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> whoa, I got it: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71652322/1641112

[18:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> sometimes coding by trial and error works üôÇ

[18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> is this documented anywhere?

[21:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> If I have `$method = 'flip'` how can I do `$object.$method`?

[21:12] <MasterDuke> `$object."$method"()`

[21:16] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> sweet, thanks. been searching for like 20 min. one of those things you read about once and then can't find again

[21:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this seems to be a recurring question...

[21:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's not a very obvious answer. looks like the quotes cause the 1st pass compiler to hard code it, if I were to guess

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's not a very obvious answer. looks like the quotes cause the 1st pass compiler to hard code the string, if I were to guess

[21:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> but I have no idea how that works

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> where is that in the official docs?

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> and what is it called? I tried many different terms to search on it but wasn't even sure what to call it. "dynamic function"?

[21:52] <MasterDuke> https://docs.raku.org/language/objects#index-entry-indirect_invocant_syntax it's mentioned a paragraph or two down

[22:02] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ah, yup. I remember reading that example. thanks..

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I have a package wth classes in it. I want to call the packages dynamically, like this:

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> method process($class) {

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273>     $!content = Vimwiki::File::TextProcessingClasses($class).process($!content);

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> }

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ```

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> It's throwing an error though:

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `Combination of indirect name lookup and call not supported`

[22:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I tried using `<>` and `""` instead of `()` around the class name but none of them worked

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> posted to SO:

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71654625/workaround-for-combination-of-indirect-name-lookup-and-call-not-supported-erro

[23:34] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> A class is a package after all. So https://docs.raku.org/language/packages#Looking_up_names applies.

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> And indirect method calls are "documented" in https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S02-names/indirect.t .

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> huh, so I had to throw '::' in the front of it. works now

[23:43] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can't say I really understand it, though
