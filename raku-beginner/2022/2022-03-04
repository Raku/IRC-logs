[02:46] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> What is perl 6 and what is raku?

[02:48] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> <@102059593697361920> 

[02:48] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> raku.land ;

[02:48] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> What a bout rest microservice?

[02:48] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Also; do we have ORM for raku?

[02:50] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Dependency Injection. and aspect oriented stuff!

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Raku began as Perl 6

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> it was meant to be the sixth version of Perl but ultimately was so different a language that it got renamed

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Cro is meant primarily for microservices

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> it just happens to also have some features for building out full websites

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I'm not sure if there are any ORMS yet

[02:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I'm not sure if there are any ORMs yet

[02:53] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> What happened to perl 6 then? It is coming as normal Perl after perl 5 life cycle?

[02:53] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Good to know. really thanks

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> nah, Perl is moving on to Perl 7

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> to avoid confusion

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> So his to you connect to databases?

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> you can use DBIish https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> you can also use modules.raku.org to search for stuff

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> So how do you connect to databases?

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> for example, database-related modules: https://modules.raku.org/t/DATABASE

[02:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> looks like there *is* an ORM called Red

[02:56] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> How lightweight us raku? I was reading about it running on JVM.

[02:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I mean it's a pretty big language

[02:56] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Is it like java in the sense that write once run everywhere?

[02:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> and tbh there's still more work to be done on optimizing

[02:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> yeah, it's not platform-dependent unless you make it

[02:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> there is a version of Rakudo that targets the JVM

[02:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> so you can totally do that

[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Also to answer an earlier question, you could definitely achieve something like aspect-oriented programming using the meta-object protocol

[02:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> https://docs.raku.org/language/mop

[02:59] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> <@102059593697361920> you mentioned vim earlier; could give me the plugin[s] link[s].

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I don't use any plugin so I'm not sure

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> maybe someone else here knows

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> So far what I can see from the far distance that I am;

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> Raku is a complete language

[03:00] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> <@102059593697361920> no auto complete no intellisense

[03:01] <discord-raku-bot> <sabas3dgh#6795> üßê

[03:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I find I don't need it mostly heh

[03:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Maybe I am just doing things the hard or inefficient way though

[03:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I have a tendency to do that, to get something working just enough that it doesn't annoy the hell out of me

[03:03] <discord-raku-bot> <frost#6297> <@944673858529685594>  you can try comma, the raku ide

[03:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> and then not improve my setup even when there is much room for improvement

[09:04] <SmokeMachine> Rogue, sabas3dgh: yes, Red is an ORM for Raku: https://fco.github.io/Red/

[11:22] <SmokeMachine> It also has a channel here: #red

[18:12] <discord-raku-bot> <ei#5539> im trying to make this match and it seems to be failing. if i apply the regex within the `TOP` token standalone with the `~~` operator, it works tho. why?
