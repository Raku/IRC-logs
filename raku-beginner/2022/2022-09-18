[08:36] <jaguart> are there unicode-pretties for $^a and $^b in a sort comparitor? thought I spotted this the other day, but dont see a mention on https://docs.raku.org/language/unicode_entry#Some_characters_useful_in_Raku

[08:42] <jaguart> I'm guessing not, now that I've read about the ^ twigil - as 'a' and 'b' are just unicode sorted placeholder variable names
