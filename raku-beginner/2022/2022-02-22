[07:07] <jaguart> beginner question about ecosystem... https://docs.raku.org/language/faq#index-entry-ecosystem points us to apply for a PAUSE account and use CPAN - or should we be thinking about ``zef`` and ``fez``? If so, are there any docs for a ``zef`` newbie?

[07:12] <jaguart> Also found: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Distributing_modules 

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> zef is favored and the rest are becoming rather just fallbacks

[08:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Having said that, I don't know much about the usage either...

[09:43] <lizmat> jaguart: good points!

[09:46] <lizmat> Will make sure they mention fez, and update them further once https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/316 has been resolved

[09:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> no ACTION? :c

[22:53] <jaguart> Thanks for the pointers to zef... 

[22:59] <jaguart> So I'm reading what I can find... very basic question - assuming ZEF has a list of sources, how do I set up a zef server and add it into the sources so that I can install both public-global and private-local packages?

[23:03] <lizmat> basically what you need is to set up a config for it: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/commit/9df58c6152deedf2b5986f47d47ad2fba030c4fd shows how that was done for the REA

[23:04] <lizmat> and then setup an endpoint that can serve the META required by zef: which is basically a JSON of the META's of the modules that you want to provide

[23:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> thank you ðŸ™‚

[23:04] <lizmat> perhaps I should add an option to Zef::Configuration for that  :-)

[23:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> oh yes please ðŸ™‚

[23:05] <lizmat> ok, lemme do that tomorrow  :-)  

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> lizmat++ hero

[23:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> Being able to use zef/fez to install private as well as public packages makes it much easier to get these and other raku ecosystems added to the corporate approved lists ðŸ™‚

[23:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> and now starts to look at pointing fez to the local/private package server...

[23:17] <lizmat> sleep&

[23:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> hmm - which leads me to Naming... is there no pumpking for Raku ecosystem naming?

[23:35] <guifa> Jaguart: the :auth<foo> naming system sort of obviates naming clashes

[23:36] <guifa> I can have Utils:auth<me> and you can have Utils:auth<you> and as long as people say `use Utils:auth<someone>` there won't be any issues

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> Yeah - I can see that, auth is like the vendor part of other env ecosystems

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> so is there any effort to come to a naming consensus - e.g. I've a small package I call PHP::Tiny -> being a nod to JSON::Tiny, but the Perlish equiv is PHP::Serialize

[23:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> actually, I use JAMD::PHP::Tiny - JAMD being myt Vendor equiv

[23:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> actually, I use JAMD::PHP::Tiny - JAMD being my Vendor equiv
