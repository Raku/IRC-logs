[00:03] <guifa> Nemokosch: if you update Intl::CLDR to 0.7.2, Intl::Format::Number should install no problem now O:-)

[00:10] <jaguart> trying to ``rakubrew triple`` to upgrade

[00:10] <jaguart> getting /usr/bin/ld: ./libmoar.so: undefined reference to `uv__cloexec_ioctl'

[00:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> should have asked what this command was supposed to do before running it...

[00:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it did compile for me though

[00:21] <jaguart> oh - ``rakubrew build`` seems to have resolved - apparently ``triple`` hadn't updated the moarvm repo

[00:24] * jaguart shrugs - or maybe not build works triple fails

[00:26] <jaguart> has zef repo changed name of master to something else?

[00:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yes, main

[00:27] <jaguart> hmmm

[00:27] *** Nemokosch joined
[00:31] <jaguart> so the real fix is ``rakubrew self-upgrade`` to get all the latest repos and branch names, doh

[00:31] <jaguart> rakubrew triple

[00:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> indeed, I did that prior to running the command üòÖ

[00:32] *** Nemokosch left
[00:34] <jaguart> still failing...

[00:51] <jaguart> So ``triple`` works if I remove old ``~/.rakubrew/versions/moar-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD`` - I'm putting it down to branch name changes etc.

[00:53] <jaguart> and the ``build-zef`` fix was also to remove the ~/.rakubrew/repos/zef repo

[02:50] *** deoac joined
[02:51] <deoac> How do I write a regex to match ANSI/xterm terminal codes?

[02:51] <deoac> "\e"

[02:52] <deoac> \/\\e\[\d+m/ doesn't work

[02:52] <deoac> ignore the leading backslash

[03:05] <kjp> deoac: The "\e" is an escape character, so something like "/\x1b" is one possibility

[03:09] <kjp> or "\[ESCAPE]" might be clearer

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> What is the easiest way to interlace the elements of an array with a value? E.g. from `<1 2 3>` and `a` to get `<1 a 2 a 3>` .

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> ```perl

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> > (gather for @a {take 'a'; take $_})[1..*]

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> (1 a 2 a 3)```

[21:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> this was my first idea, but I don't like it all that much

[21:09] <avuserow> m: my @a = <a b c>; say @a.kv # @lakmatiol

[21:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 67513cb87: OUTPUT: ¬´(0 a 1 b 2 c)‚ê§¬ª

[21:10] <avuserow> m: my @a = <a b c>; say flat zip @a.keys, @a; # or more generally, with zip

[21:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 67513cb87: OUTPUT: ¬´(0 a 1 b 2 c)‚ê§¬ª

[21:13] <avuserow> oh sorry I didn't fully read this :|

[21:16] <avuserow> m: my @a = <1 2 3>; say zip(@a, "a" xx *).flat.head(*-1)

[21:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 67513cb87: OUTPUT: ¬´(1 a 2 a 3)‚ê§¬ª

[21:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yeah big brain

[22:25] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol> yeah, IG zip and flat is nicer than gather here

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not sure if anybody likes this but it's sufficiently weird to show...

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: sub jojin(List() $lhs, $rhs, :$inner = $*INNER) { |$lhs, $inner, $rhs }; given 'a' -> $*INNER { dd [[&jojin]] (1, 2, 3, 4, 8); }

[23:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > (1, "a", 2, "a", 3, "a", 4, "a", 8)

[23:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> of course at this point you can rename your sub `jojin` to something like `infix:<J>`
