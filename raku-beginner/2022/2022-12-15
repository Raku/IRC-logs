[02:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Mason> so if I want to implement a more performant type to be a key to a hash

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mason> how would I go about it

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mason> specifically something faster than using `"{$a},{$b}"` as the ket

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mason> specifically something faster than using `"{$a},{$b}"` as the key

[02:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Mason> I understand which is the key, but is it really not possible to go faster?

[22:39] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> how do i pass a array with 3 elements to a function that accepts 3 arguments?

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think slip can work

[22:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> |@arr, or @arr.Slip, or slip @arr

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```pl

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> sub brint(@bitmap) {

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   for @bitmap {

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>     ansi($_.Slip).say

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   }

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   print "\e\n";

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> }

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> here's my current code. it gives me this error:

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> Too few positionals passed; expected 3 arguments but got 1

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   in sub ansi at test.raku line 23

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   in sub brint at test.raku line 28

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay>   in block <unit> at test.raku line 35

[22:48] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> ```

[22:49] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> changing the $ to a @ gives me the same error

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> changing $ to @ wouldn't do anything useful I think

[22:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what about |$_ ?

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> alright so that fixed the issue entirely

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i just don't know what that means or what it does

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it unrolls the content into arguments

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I wish it worked with .Slip as well

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> but what's the logic behind that

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> nvm

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> that's literally what it does

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/%7C

[22:56] <discord-raku-bot> <yabobay> i thought it did something else and we just harnessed that to do this thing
