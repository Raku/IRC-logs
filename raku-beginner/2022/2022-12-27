[00:27] <fennewald> hey, what's the way to do Optional return types. Specifically, if I define a function that will either return a `Str` or nothing at all, what is the best way to do that?

[01:08] *** Kaiepi left
[02:58] <jaguart> Just set the return type to Str - the 'or Nil' is implicit

[03:00] <jaguart> https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Return_type_constraints

[03:00] <jaguart> Says: `Note that Nil and Failure are exempt from return type constraints and can be returned from any routine, regardless of its constraint`

[03:04] <jaguart> I'm not that experienced, but I wonder if the Signature constraint e.g. sub foo(--> Int) {} somewhat differs from the trait-like syntax: sub foo() returns Int {};

[03:04] <jaguart> in that under introspection, the Signature of the first sub is different from the signature of the second.

[03:05] <jaguart> and maybe that makes a difference for multis?

[03:15] <jaguart> oh - just found this too: https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#returns which says 'the pointy arrow form is always preferred'

[10:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> fennewald: more to this. the `Str` type signature covers "definite" and "indefinite" values of `Str`

[10:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "definite" values are concrete instances with appropriate data while the only indefinite instance is the type object `Str` itself. You can denote that you want definite content with `Str:D` and you can mark your data as "indefinite" using `Str:U`

[10:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in some sense, `Str` can stand for "nothing at all, *as a string*". Same for all type objects. This means that you can retain strict types with missing values as well, if that's what you want

[10:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> by the way: since anything ultimately descends from `Mu`, you can catch all type objects by `Mu:U`
