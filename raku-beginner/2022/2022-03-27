[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I have used the payed version for year. I could not install (and use) the free Comma version. I used the free _plugin_ in IntelliJ.

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I have used the payed version for a year. Before that, I could not install (and use) the free Comma version -- I used the free _plugin_ in IntelliJ.

[16:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I have the paid version of comma but not the paid version of IntelliJ with the comma plug-in.

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I used the free version of IntelliJ and the free version of Commaide.

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I used the free version of IntelliJ and the free version of Commaide on macOS.

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I used the free version of IntelliJ and the free version of Commaide, on macOS, for nearly three years.

[16:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I cannot tell how stable the whole thing was -- some problems did pop out, but they were resolved quickly enough (for me). The "trick" was not eagerly upgrade IntelliJ and Commaide.

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I downloaded the free version of IntelliJ with plug-in. Seems to work. Let’s see if it’s more stable.
