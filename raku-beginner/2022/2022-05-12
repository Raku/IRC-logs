[10:45] <mayd17> hi, on Windows, on the command line, I do this: `raku -e 'say "-" ~ 1'`

[10:46] <mayd17> and I get `-1` as expected

[10:46] <mayd17> then I do `raku -e 'say "-" ~ 0'`

[10:46] <mayd17> but I get `0`!

[10:47] <mayd17> if I interchanged the single/double quotes, both work fine

[10:47] <mayd17> is this due to powershell?

[10:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what if you `echo 'say "-" ~ 0'`?

[10:52] <mayd17> then i get `say "-" ~ 0`

[10:54] <mayd17> on Ubuntu both single and double quote combinations work for both 0 and 1 fine

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and what if you start the raku repl and run say "-" ~ 0 there?

[10:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and what if you start the raku repl and run `say "-" ~ 0` there?

[10:54] <mayd17> then I get `-0` no problem

[10:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I know 😄

[10:55] <mayd17> I also tried a script before that with that line, works okay

[10:55] <mayd17> then why did you ask :d

[10:55] <mayd17> oh, rheotrical questions? :d

[10:55] <mayd17> if so, i didn't get the thing

[10:55] <mayd17> fyi

[10:57] <mayd17> oh you said I know to the Ubuntu thing, right? sorry okay

[11:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> yeah

[11:25] <mayd17> context: i was trying to rename many files whose names follow the pattern `file(\d+).png` but numbers in them start from 1; I needed them 0-indexed. Also, a hyphen before the digits is needed, i.e., `file-(\d+).png`. I thought I can do with Raku on the command line with `raku -e 'rename($_, .subst(/(\d+)/, {"-" ~ ($0 - 1)})) for dir'`

[11:26] <mayd17> and it works except for `file1.png` to `file-0.png`. It gave `file0.png` instead.

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> time to ask Coke I guess

[11:29] <mayd17> should I drink something? :d

[11:33] <lizmat> Coke is offline until tomorroqw

[11:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so you say "-" ~ 0 itself evaluated to '0'?

[11:37] <mayd17> oh Coke is a user here, so sorry

[11:37] <mayd17> yes it gives `0` when I do `raku -e 'say "-" ~ 0'`

[11:39] <mayd17> if I do with `-8` instead of `0`, it gives `8`

[11:40] <mayd17> if I do with `7` instead of `0`, it gives `-7`

[11:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm confident the order of evaluation is bad some way

[11:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like the string is interpolated by your shell, not Raku, or something like that

[11:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you said Powershell?

[11:46] <mayd17> yes

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well what is still possible is that the -e switch itself passes the argument wrong

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> this is why it would be good if you could run your stuff from the repl

[12:56] <mayd17> worse things happen with perl, so powershell is doing some uninteresting things

[12:57] <mayd17> though, it gives a syntax error, maybe that's not worse not sure

[12:57] <mayd17> syntax error around double quotes inside

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> ```

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> sub foo($bar) {

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614>    print "Hello";

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> }

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> foo();

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> ```

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> Gives a pretty good error that "Error while compiling: Calling foo() will never work with declared signature ($bar)". However this error doesn't show up when you run raku -c on this script. Why wouldn't -c catch this compilation error?

[18:49] <MasterDuke> -c is really just (currently) a syntax check. i don't know if there's more planned to be done with it

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> Thanks! I think I was just surprised that another compilation step happened in between -c and code execution.

[19:40] <MasterDuke> currently the optimizer also does some correctness checking. part of the current rakuast effort is to split that out into more well defined stages

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> rakuast always shows up

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's almost like an inside joke at this point 😄

[20:00] *** n1to joined
[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> Haha, thanks. I suppose my follow up question would be how to trigger the optimizer from nqp::getcomp. I'm building a language server (see https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bscan.raku-navigator ) and using the parsing method from https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Parser which doesn't do the optimizer stage. Have you seen any examples of parsing with the optimizer? If I can squeeze out b

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> o.O very nice

[20:21] <MasterDuke> you'd have to compile the code i believe

[20:22] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/ForeignCode.pm6#L43-L72 might be relevant

[20:23] <MasterDuke> or ping nine, lizmat, vrurg, etc over in #raku-dev

[20:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Bscan🍺#6614> Thanks. I'll try to get it working this weekend, and then perhaps ping them for a quick code review.
