[00:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@329084082162106371> Thanks! My solution is very similar `my @v = <1 2 3>; my $sep = 'a'; ((@v Z ($sep xx @res.elems)).flat)[^(*-1)]`  . Using `.head(-1)`  did not occur to me...

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> You might be better off using X instead of Z actually

[00:16] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> Getting some vague lisp vibes here, pretty neat

[00:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Especially if items are turned into one-element lists, which i would anticipate

[00:18] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@329084082162106371> I use Mathematica and R a lot, and both of them are LISP descendants .

[00:18] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow> If you're guaranteed to have single character lists on both sides, you could just join and comb.
