[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> how to ask the bot

[19:05] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> to evaluate code

[19:06] <MasterDuke> just 'm: <your code here>', but i'm not sure it always works from discord. i think it's supposed to, but if it doesn't, i believe gfldex is the person to ask

[19:07] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m: say 'ohai!';

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> say 'multiline ohai!';

[19:08] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[19:29] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> m: say 9/99999999999999999999;

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> m: say 9/999999999999999999999;

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> where are speaking from masteduke

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> m: 

[19:30] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> say 9/999999999999999999999;

[19:31] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> so  my question is, when does raku switch to scientific notation and how can i force it to show real numbers, or big numbers

[19:37] <gfldex> When the denominator exceeds 64bit it will convert to the type stored in $*RAT-OVERFLOW .

[19:38] <gfldex> m: say $*RAT-OVERFLOW;

[19:45] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> can i force it to use big number

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> <@905663388133257246> see: https://docs.raku.org/type/FatRat

[20:16] <MasterDuke> systems: not sure what exactly you're asking, but i'm on irc

[20:19] <MasterDuke> btw, that`Unhandled exception: Cannot unbox 70 bit wide bigint into native integer` you were getting earlier is arguably a bug. it happens when the optimizer is trying to warn about things being used in sink/void context (e.g., your bare `9/999999999999999999999` instead of `say 9/999999999999999999999`), and it's using native integers to do some

[20:19] <MasterDuke> calculations, when maybe it should be checking if the values are larger than native and then use bigint ops

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> thanks

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> FatRat is cool

[21:28] <discord-raku-bot> <systems#1965> üôÇ

[21:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Aha, but nude fat rats are cooler.

[22:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> E.g. `say FatRat.new(143242,13429*10**4).nude;`

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> XD

[22:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or fat rat nudes...

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> it's true

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> `nude FatRat(0.0) but True :`
