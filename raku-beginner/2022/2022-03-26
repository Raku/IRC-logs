[05:35] <CIAvash> stevied: I'm not saying `run` shouldn't be used, `Proc::Async` has its own issues(software have bugs). But some of the issues of `Proc` make it less reliable and consistent. It has some sinking and error/exitcode issues, a few examples: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1590 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2197 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3720

[11:43] <lizmat> Files=1351, Tests=117115, 296 wallclock secs (35.18 usr  9.67 sys + 4083.14 cusr 334.93 csys = 4462.92 CPU)

[11:44] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what does that mean? Is that good?

[11:44] <lizmat> I'm just posting these to show the current state

[11:44] <lizmat> and then can use the search option on irclogs.raku.org to see progress  :-)

[11:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> current state as in how fast for how many tests?

[11:45] <lizmat> oops, posted on the wrong channel  :-)

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, I learned something, I guess

[11:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> neat. that's a lot of tests

[11:50] * lizmat also learned that she forgot to add a file to the list of test-files to be run

[17:05] <drakonis> that's one heckuva time capsule

[21:48] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone got any ideas on this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71548158/intellij-not-showing-lines-that-begin-with-in-test-output

[21:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I think it must be a bug but maybe there's a setting somewhere in Comma I can change.

[22:12] *** zacts left
[22:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> looks like comma is using the raku command to generate the output

[22:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i don't see an option to control the printing of lines that begin with '#' though

[22:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> running the same file from the command line in raku produces expected results. so gotta be comma

[22:58] *** zacts joined
[23:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> if i turn remove the plan from the test file, I get full output. of course, the test fails
