[21:09] <discord-raku-bot> <JoKing> one problem i have with that form of regex is that it doesn't allow for `S{.}.=&{}`

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <JoKing> one problem i have with that form of regex is that it doesn't allow for `S{.}.=&func`

[21:11] <discord-raku-bot> <South> whats the intention with that

[21:12] <discord-raku-bot> <JoKing> apply an arbitrary func to each match

[21:13] <discord-raku-bot> <South> gotcha
