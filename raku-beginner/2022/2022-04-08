[15:08] <deadmarshal> Hi. what is wrong with this $index? https://paste.c-net.org/DisgustDreamin

[15:13] <lizmat> deadmarshal: how is @nums defined ?   that's missing from the gist ?

[15:14] <deadmarshal> it is a simple array: my @nums = 1,2,3,4,5,6;

[15:16] <lizmat> OOC, which version of Rakudo are you running ?

[15:16] <lizmat> with that definition, the code works for me

[15:17] <deadmarshal> https://paste.c-net.org/GerryMoves

[15:17] <deadmarshal> I installed with rakubrew.

[15:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'd say there are multiple questionable things about the code, although that doesn't explain why it doesn't work
