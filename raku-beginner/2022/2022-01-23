[01:03] <Esoren> One more question.¬† Is there anything like a Char type or is it only Strs?¬† Currently I have this in my script to avoid mistakes: `subset Char of Str where .chars == 1;`

[01:55] <guifa> Nope, just a string.  You could also just use int8 or uint8 if you want to limit yourself to -128 .. 127 or 0..255

[04:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> Esoren - yeah, your approach is probably the best because of all the complexity of Unicode handling

[04:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> There's a lot going on in Raku strings

[04:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> there's no Char class because not much would be gained in terms of cimplifications vs. Str

[04:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> simplifications*

[09:52] <m_athias> hi! is there a way to tell Comma where to place closing parenthesis? as in https://pastebin.com/Vd4rpv9M

[14:07] <lostsoul> Hi world

[14:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lostsoul Hi! Don't be too lost...

[14:15] <MasterDuke> m_athias: i don't know, but since comma is built on top of intellij, searching for how to do it in that might get more hits

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <tailgate#1731> if I see Bool:D what does the üòÑ mean?

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <tailgate#1731> the:D - discord turned it into an emoji

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> `:D` means defined, which is kind of similar to non-null in other languages

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <tailgate#1731> ah. do they have a term like sigil/twigil ?

[18:06] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> I am pretty sure `:word` is an adverb

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> but I am not 100% on this one

[18:17] <discord-raku-bot> <tailgate#1731> thanks!

[18:18] <gfldex> they are called type-smiley

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can someone help clarify an error I'm getting? it's gibberish to me. It happens when I do this:  `our $t is export (:MANDATORY)` instead of `our $t is export(:MANDATORY)`

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> error is `No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Any'`

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this error crops up quite frequently and I don't quite understand why the space after export causes the error to be thrown

[19:57] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I know what the error means, but I don't know why it's generated.

[20:01] <lizmat> m: Any()

[20:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac009507a: OUTPUT: ¬´WARNINGS for <tmp>:‚ê§Useless use of constant value Any() in sink context (line 1)‚ê§¬ª

[20:01] <lizmat> m: (my $)()

[20:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar ac009507a: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Any'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[20:02] <lizmat> stevied  ^^  a golf for what you see: basically an undefined value is used as if it is something Callable

[20:04] <MasterDuke> so `foo;` is calling the sub named 'foo' with no arguments. so is `foo();`. but `foo ();` is calling the sub named 'foo' with an argument of an empty list

[20:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what is the empty list? the space?

[20:19] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I guess I should go read up more on callables. I tend to skip over most of that section when I come to it.

[20:20] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> it's getting parsed as `(our $t is export)(:MANDATORY)`

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```perl

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > my $a = (our $x is export)

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> (Any)

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > $a

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> (Any)

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> > $a()

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Any'

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020>   in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> ```

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> it's a bit strange, I will admit

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> yeah, this feels like a grammar deficit

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <lakmatiol#8020> `my &a is default(&say) (54)` gets parsed differently for example.

[20:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> type smiley is cute üòÑ

[20:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ah, I see

[20:26] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so "is" is another function that give the the $t object a callable `export` role which takes an argument of `:MANDATORY`

[20:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> er, maybe no

[20:59] <MasterDuke> sort of, see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/traits.pm6 for the gory details
