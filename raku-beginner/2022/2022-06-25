[01:50] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I keep reading about this mythical ability to automatically test in the background but I can't seem to find detailed instructions for it. Maybe CI doesn't mean what I think it does. I'm not sure

[08:22] <discord-raku-bot> <locria#8416> Is there a simpler way to concat path than ` $*SPEC.join($, 'a', 'b')`

[08:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what even is this $*SPEC, man ðŸ˜„

[08:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, what is that first argument...

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, what about

[08:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `'a'.IO.add('b')`

[08:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> you can add multiple arguments or a List as well

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> i've never heard of this locally. maybe `lib` can be `watch`ed or something

[08:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Morfent#9811> github actions takes a bit of time to wrangle but hasn't done me wrong so far

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Interesting. Maybe I misunderstood then.

[09:55] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Yeah I use GitHub actions
