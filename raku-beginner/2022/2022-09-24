[16:25] <deoac> I received this error: "Type check failed in binding to parameter 'SELF'; expected Any but got BOOTException (BOOTException)"

[16:25] <deoac> What is a BOOTException?Â  I can't find it in the documentation?

[16:26] <deoac> It followed the error "Partially dimensioned views of shaped arrays not yet implemented. Sorry."

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> that's an nqp exception type

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> er

[16:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> REPR

[16:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> nah type

[16:27] <deoac> Weirdly, I get this after using 'artially dimensioned views of shaped arrays' several times!

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> it shouldn't be there

[16:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> passing `--ll-exception` to `raku` would give enough information for an issue maybe

[16:32] <deoac> I'm not getting the error in the REPR.Â  It's coming from an application.

[16:32] <deoac> I'm using: Welcome to Rakudoâ„¢ v2022.07.

[16:32] <deoac> Implementing the RakuÂ® Programming Language v6.d.

[16:32] <deoac> Built on MoarVM version 2022.07.

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> REPR is not REPL

[16:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> REPR helps back a type

[16:34] <deoac> Ah, my mistake

[16:35] <deoac> Running with `--ll-exception` had no effect.Â  Same error messages.

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> it can give more detailed ones sometimes. what do they say?

[16:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> (in full)

[16:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> and can you provide any code to trigger the error with?

[16:46] <deoac> $.quadrants is a 2-dim grid of sectors.Â  Sectors are a 2-dim grid of objects.

[16:46] <deoac> Errors are from the CATCH blocks

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> huh, kinda frightening

[16:48] <deoac> Which? My code or the errors?

[16:50] <deoac> BTW, the first time I call this function, only the first CATCH is executed.

[16:50] <deoac> After that both CATCHes are triggered.

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> > Partially dimensioned views of shaped arrays not yet implemented. Sorry.

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> This error is okay, or I mean, a reasonable type of error

[16:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> The other one seems kind of like nuclear reactors melting

[16:51] <deoac> Yet, many times 'partially dimensioned views of shaped arrays' works just fine.

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Well, that "shouldn't" work

[16:52] <deoac> :-)

[16:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if your array is not 2-dimensional and you are providing 2 dimensions, that won't work, at least not at the moment

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> i wonder if `Failure`'s involved somewhere, somehow

[16:58] *** discord-raku-bot left

[17:00] <deoac> The arrays are definitely 2-dim.Â  If I remove one of the dimensions, I get the error `Cannot assign to a 2 dimension array with only 1 dimensions`

[17:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it could be a bug, hard to tell from this code

[20:09] <deoac> New question.

[20:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> go ahead ðŸ˜…

[20:10] <deoac> I have a sub that returns an array made up of three values - a Str, Array[Rat], Object - in that order.Â  How can a specify this with `returns` or `-->` ?

[20:12] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> That is an excellent question but I'm afraid I'm not going to be of any use. I barely ever use type annotations.

[20:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> lately I have heard of the Data::Record module made by Kaiepi: https://raku.land/zef:Kaiepi/Data::Record seems like it could come handy

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> m:```

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex>     subset Stuffz of List where { .elems == 3 && .[0] ~~ Str && .[1] ~~ Array[Rat] && .[2] ~~ Any:D }

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex>     sub foo( --> Stuffz) {}

[20:15] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex> ```

[20:15] <gfldex> deoac: please note that you don't specify a return type with `returns`, you tell the compiler to do a runtime value check on returning a value.

[20:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> `subset Stuffz of List:D where (Str, Array[Rat], Any:D)` should work too

[20:25] <deoac> gfldex: Thanks, I'll use --> instead

[20:25] <gfldex> --> and `returns` are equivalent

[20:25] <deoac> Thanks for the `subset` tip.Â  They really are a nifty and useful part of the language!

[20:26] <gfldex> Actually, they are a cludge to keep the gammar less complicated that it is already. :) 

[20:27] <gfldex> And they often provide LTA error messages. We really could do with tuples, like in Nim.
