[03:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Hey guys, I'm pretty new to programming.  I've played with some *really* simple Python programs and C++ text-based games before, but for all practical purposes I'm a complete beginner.

[03:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> I believe Raku installed correctly and I've got Comma running.  I'm noticing that I can't run (SHIFT + F10) files in Comma like I could with Python, the triangle run indicator just won't select and shift+F10 doesn't do anything either.

[03:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Not really sure what to do

[05:40] <thowe> haven't used Windows since the 90s and never used Comma; I'm no help here.

[09:15] <MasterDuke> @Yeuph you probably need to point comma at your raku install. for me, it's under File -> Project Structure -> Raku Compilers

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> <@285219620208771072> you gave up on vim already?

[12:58] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> <@285219620208771072> on simple option to get started quickly is: https://replit.com/languages/raku

[12:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> @Yeuph#9974 one simple option to get started quickly is: https://replit.com/languages/raku

[13:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Okie doke. I'll play around with that when I get home from work. Ty ty

[20:35] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> how can I get the attributes and values of an object dumped out to a hash?

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @stivied This SO discussion has relevant links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68622047/find-programmatically-all-classes-grammars-and-roles-in-a-raku-package

[20:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> thanks, I'll check it out

[20:59] <MasterDuke> m: my $f = FatRat.new(1, 3); for $f.^attributes -> $a { my $n = $a.name.substr(2); say "$a = {$f."$n"()}" if $f.^can($n) }    # @stevied this is sort of a hack job, but might get you started

[20:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7dc3add84: OUTPUT: «$!numerator = 1␤$!denominator = 3␤»

[21:00] <MasterDuke> m: my $f = FatRat.new(1, 3); for $f.^attributes -> $a { my $n = $a.name.substr(2); say "$a = {$f.?"$n"()}" }    # or this perhaps

[21:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7dc3add84: OUTPUT: «$!numerator = 1␤$!denominator = 3␤»

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> Thanks, yeah, I was able to figure it out from this post: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/19/day-19-introspection/

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I did the same thing you did, looks like

[21:33] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm surprised there isn't an easier way

[21:37] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> converting my crappy little module over to OO took 2 days for me to figure out. ugh. and it's probably garbage

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> m:```

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     my $f = FatRat.new(1,3);

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     my %h = $f.^attributes.map({ use nqp; .name => nqp::getattr(nqp::decont($f), $f.WHAT, .name) });

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222>     dd %h;

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> ```

[21:53] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @stevied#8273 There be dragons if you poke around in the private parts of objects.

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> @gfldex#8222 well, for now, my goal is to just get something that works and learn OO in Raku

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> looks like comma is linked up to my compiler

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> states "Raku v2021.12" under File -> Project Structure -> Raku Compilers

[23:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> in C:\Program Files\Rakudo\bin

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> This is helpful.  Playing around now

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Still really wanna get Comma working

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> ty tyu

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> ty ty

[23:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> np

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Yeuph#9974> Replit that is, in case that wasn't clear

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> right

[23:52] <MasterDuke> shift+f10 and the run button work for me. you might want to try over in #cro, a bunch of the comma devs are there (though this is probably too late for them, you'll have better luck tomorrow)
