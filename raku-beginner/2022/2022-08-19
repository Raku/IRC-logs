[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> It can be done, but you need to `zef  fetch DB::Pg`

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> then find where it was unpacked. Mine was in 

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> .zef/store/DB-Pg-1.1/52D70AD17E03A3794698298A269EC615E39EF361

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> so `cd .zef/store/DB-Pg-1.1/52D70AD17E03A3794698298A269EC615E39EF361`

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> then `vim META6.json`

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> and find the dependencies and you'll see ` "pq:from<native>:ver<5>"` change it to `"pq:from<native>"`

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> Finally in that same directory run `zef install .`

[18:00] <discord-raku-bot> <grenzo> unfortunately, I don't yet know why this works.
