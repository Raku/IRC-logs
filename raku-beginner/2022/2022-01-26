[02:29] <jaguart> Looking for hints on how to find out why MY-Grammar.parse($text) returns Nil/Any when Grammar::Tracer shows matches all the way to the TOP?

[04:46] <jaguart> so it's probably an anti-pattern - but in class MY-Action I can set $!ast in method-TOP and retain the Grammar.parse() results even though .parse() is returning Nil.

[04:48] <jaguart> i.e. class MyAction { has $.ast; method TOP ($/) { make $<value>.made; $!ast = $/.made; } } # but this feels wrong

[06:33] <guifa> if the action class is calling TOP, then something weird is going on, because the parse should have been successful at that point

[12:39] <CIAvash> jaguart: does `subparse` return anything?
