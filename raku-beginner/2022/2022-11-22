[22:57] <habere-et-disper> What is `::` called, and what does it do in a name? Eg: `class foo::bar`

[22:57] <habere-et-disper> A search on the documentation is turning up all manner of unrelated things. Thanks!

[23:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the search of the to-be doc site is way better, I just quickly started my local instance and looked this stuff up ðŸ˜„

[23:34] <habere-et-disper> [Documentation of splice] https://docs.raku.org/routine/splice

[23:34] <habere-et-disper> At the bottom of the page, it reads:

[23:34] <habere-et-disper> "$bÃº.splice:Â Â 0,Â 3,Â <3Â 2Â 1>;"

[23:34] <habere-et-disper> But bÃº is not yet defined?

[23:37] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you are right; seems like something is missing there

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> you know... the problem is the following

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the actual unit of documentation is this file: https://github.com/Raku/doc/edit/master/doc//Type/Buf.pod6

[23:49] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and in this file, the examples seem to build upon the same theme - which may or may not be a good idea but isn't downright bizarre in context
