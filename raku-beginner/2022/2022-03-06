[10:59] <CIAvash> Is quoting it not an option? `f '@a[2]'` or `f "\@a[2]"`

[11:31] <immediate> no

[11:32] <immediate> maybe f needs to be something else than a function, or not I don't know

[11:33] <immediate> maybe this can be made working in repl only, or not. not sure

[11:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I feel like this question is like "how to get 1+1 equal three"

[11:51] <immediate> I don't follow and I don2t know why you feel so

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because what you say seems to downright contradict Raku's grammar

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> `@a[2]` is not a string

[11:57] <immediate> that's why I asked if possible. I was aware it wasn't a string as is

[11:58] <immediate> and your answer is no, it seems

[12:00] <immediate> for example here, https://github.com/codesections/RakuRecord, they introduce a keyword(?) and what follows is neither a string nor a valid code block (I think)

[12:00] <immediate> but it works

[12:00] <immediate> but I don't know how. I went to source code but there's no single comment

[12:01] <immediate> maybe that's not intended for beginners like me

[12:01] <immediate> readme also doesnt say how it works

[12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know if what you are asking about is possible but that it's not intended is clear as water

[12:02] <immediate> I found that module in reddit

[12:19] <CIAvash> That's inheriting from `Metamodel::ClassHOW`, so creating a record keyword that acts like a class.

[12:20] <CIAvash> You can use slangs, or wait for RakuAST and macros

[12:21] <CIAvash> and I don't think these are for beginners

[12:25] <immediate> thanks

[12:25] <lizmat> well, that depends where you're coming from: if you're already used to the concept of meta-programming, then I think it'd be ok  :-)

[12:30] <CIAvash> I added the last sentence because of "maybe that's not intended for beginner like me", but yeah it can depend on your knowledge from other programming languages or elsewhere as well

[12:44] <CIAvash> It may depend on the design of the Raku macros, but I think for what you want to do, macro will be the easiest solution

[16:21] <codesections> Yeah, that "record" code isn't commented/super accessable for beginners â€“ sorry about that.   This Stack Overflow answer (and the blog posts linked in the question) provide a bit of context/background: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70893835/exporthow-and-declare-what-are-they

[17:47] <guifa_> what immediate wants to do can be done using slangs.  they might want to look at the sql inline slang (I think tonyo made it?) because it basically works on finding the pattern / 'sql' <text> ';' / and calls sql($*database, text)

[17:47] <guifa_> oh, oops, they're already gone

[17:50] * guifa_ . o O ( although someone who uses StackOverflow might want to comment on jnhtn's response to point out BASIC::Test, since it's a heavily documented module to show how to do pretty much what's asked )

[17:50] <guifa_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70338112/using-exporthow-to-make-declarator-that-acts-like-sub/70342023#70342023 <-- referring to that one
