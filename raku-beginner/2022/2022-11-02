[00:16] <MasterDuke> Nemokosch: but the nice thing is that there's a built in profiler. one of my favorite things about rakudo

[00:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is this the reason it's so slow? ðŸ˜„ jokes aside, the HTML output is kinda painful, you can't even navigate backwards

[00:21] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> and you know, I meant mostly on a higher level. For example, string operations are reasonably cheap, while writing ($a, $b) = (1, 2) instead of $a = 1; $b = 2 can be significant overhead in a loop

[00:23] <MasterDuke> have you tried timo++'s profile viewer? it's not finished, but it's still better in some ways

[00:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> hm, not sure I know it

[00:23] <MasterDuke> and true, though that particular example i've been working on making better

[00:26] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/timo/moarperf

[00:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I'm not sure but it could be that this is the one I know (and complain) about ðŸ˜…

[00:33] <MasterDuke> it reads the .sql output, the built in viewer is just the .html

[00:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> is there .sql as well? ðŸ‘€

[00:35] <MasterDuke> yeah, also .json, though the non-built-in viewer for that (written in qt) is quite a bit older and less capable

[00:36] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/tadzik/p6profiler-qt

[00:38] <MasterDuke> when a profile gets too big (~5mb), the built in viewer chokes, but the others can handle much bigger

[00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> instant wishlist candidate ðŸ˜„
