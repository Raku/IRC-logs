[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> can anyone see why `Nil` is getting passed to the `embed-this` subroutine with this line?

[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `make $line.subst(/<-[``]>https\:\/\/www\.youtube\.com\/watch\?v\=$<foo>=<[\w\-&=]>+/, { embed-this($<foo>) }, :g);`

[00:15] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> this line is inside an action method

[04:39] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> if I have a grammar that's been used to parse some text and then I save the Match object it returns, is there a way to run actions on the Match object later?

[04:41] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> in other words, I don't want to have to run the .parse method on the grammar because it's already been parsed, I just want to run the actions on it

[14:12] <neither> hi, how do you `assert` something in Raku?

[14:12] <neither> `die $message unless $ok`?

[14:13] <lizmat> if you want it to be trappable

[14:13] <lizmat> if you don't want it be trappable

[14:13] <lizmat> m: exit note "it didn't work out"

[14:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 530e17848: OUTPUT: «it didn't work out␤»

[14:14] <neither> oh sorry, what do you mean by trappable?

[14:16] <neither> i think you mean CATCHable?

[14:17] *** zacts left
[14:23] <lizmat> yes

[14:23] <lizmat> actually, if you want, you can catch exits too, but that takes a bit more work  :-)

[14:24] *** jgaz left
[14:25] <neither> thanks :p

[14:25] <neither> :d not :\p

[14:26] <lizmat> :-)
