[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I've never done continuous testing before. Would like to use this module: https://github.com/JJ/docker-raku-test

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> the container runs and then quits

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> it's not clear to me how to keep it running while I code and test in the background

[02:38] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I've never used travis before

[02:40] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I added the .travis.yml file to the distro but that didn't make a difference

[11:05] <jaguart> using rakudo v2020.12 v6.d on linux - is there a way to get the REPL to recall prior line for edit? e.g. up-arrow?

[15:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Yeah yeah, own dog food ðŸ˜‹

[15:17] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks.  I'll check it out

[15:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> maybe sparrow isn't what I'm looking for. I want to run the tests locally, automatically

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Can't be worse than Travis for that purpose

[16:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Although I don't know if this qualifies as a compliment, Travis is not really meant for that

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Is it possible to have `BagHash` with a custom test function?

[21:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Is it possible to have `BagHash` or `BagMix` with a custom test function?
