[12:18] <habere-et-disper> Hi all o/

[12:18] <habere-et-disper> I'm trying to set a default value for a grammar. I thought this reasonable:

[12:18] <habere-et-disper> m: my grammar foo is default(False) { }

[12:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6cded78e9: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤'foo' cannot inherit from 'default' because it is unknown.␤at <tmp>:1␤»

[12:18] <habere-et-disper> But I'm not sure what to make of that error message!

[12:35] *** habere-et-disper left
[12:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> foo is not a value but a class type

[15:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> What is the easiest / shortest code to get all intermediate results of a reduction operation? (I.e. when applying `reduce`.) Of course, I can just write a for loop, but maybe there is something neater.

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> using `produce`

[15:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> m: [\+] (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) andthen .say

[15:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> that was `[\+]` by the way, just discord eats it in display

[16:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@297037173541175296> Ah, yes -- thanks! I remember now seeing / reading this...
