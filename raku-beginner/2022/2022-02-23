[00:09] <guifa> I don't think the ecosystem has enough stuff to have developed strong naming patterns ‚Äî¬†codesections and I were actually discussion the naming question on Grammars and Actions and there's nothing rremotely near universal consensus there on their names or the names of the modules that contain them.

[05:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> If I ``zef list --installed`` I see ALL versions of installed upgraded distributions - is this expected? e.g. ``zef upgrade`` and list --installed shows ``JSON::Fast:ver<0.16>`` and ``JSON::Fast:ver<0.17>:auth<cpan:TIMOTIMO>``

[07:35] <jdv> jaguart: makes sense as one can use multiple versions of a dist

[07:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> oops - so which one am I using in my code then?

[07:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> when no version is specified

[07:37] <jdv> iirc the highest ver

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> yeah I guess that makes sense... maybe there is a --replace option on ``zef upgrade`` - will check

[07:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Jaguart#5082> hmm - nothing obvious

[07:45] <jaguart> m: use Hash::Ordered; my %h is Hash::Ordered = ( a => 1, b => 2, c => 3 );

[07:46] <jaguart> I know that ``use Hash::Ordered; my %h is Hash::Ordered = ( a => 1, b => 2, c => 3 );`` works, and %h is an ordered Hash

[07:47] <jaguart> What is the 'is Hash::Ordered syntax when there is no `my`, e.g. when its embedded inside another hash, like my $x = %( a => %( a => 1, b => 2, ) is Hash::Ordered, ) 

[07:58] <jdv> there might be an uninstall...

[08:00] <jdv> if you really want to know what the ver of a module is you can get it it seems

[08:01] <jdv> m: use JSON::Fast; JSON::Fast.^ver;

[08:10] <jdv> basically the same thing - the "is $class" instances you mentioned

[08:18] <jdv> well, if they both worked.  the 2nd instance isn't valid.

[14:09] <guifa> jaguart: I don't think that there is.  %( ) is basically syntactical sugar for Hash.new: 

[14:10] <guifa> so you could say Hash::Ordered.new(‚Ä¶)

[14:12] *** frost left
[14:14] <guifa> If you're going to do it a lot though

[14:15] <guifa> multi sub circumfix:<%O( )> (@p) {¬†Hash::Ordered.new.STORE: @p }

[14:16] <guifa> then you can say my $foo = %O( ‚Ä¶ ); 

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is the % sigil naturally unordered?

[14:43] <guifa> There's a couple of things going on.  

[14:45] <guifa> the % sigil on a variable just means "does Associative", but by default when declared will create a Hash (e.g. my %foo; %foo will be a Hash), and Hashes are unordered

[14:47] <guifa> the %( ‚Ä¶ ) is actually a combination of two separate operators.  The first is the list operator ( ‚Ä¶ ), and then the % prefix operator which says "treat this as a Hash" (I think technically it's not an operator, but a contextualizer, and it calls `.hash` on the thing it's applied to.  So %(foo) is the same as List.new(foo).hash, which is the same as Hash.new.STORE(List.new(foo))
