[00:41] <falsifian> I think the constraint is elementwise.

[11:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> <@435939911455997952> be warned that unfortunately these messages are sent to an IRC channel as well and the way they show up is probably horrifying

[11:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it's generally a better idea to send anything long with some pastebin kinda service, e.g Github gists

[11:29] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> You might know that $/ is a variable set at all matchings - probably .parse sets it as well

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think the most straightforward solution is to break free from $/

[11:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/make

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> once you are doing matchings inside of parsing (which I'm not sure is a good idea in the first place), it's better to specify the parameter with some other name and call .make on that
