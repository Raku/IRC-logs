[09:58] <m_athias> @MasterDuke: the coding style seems to be per language. others behave 'as expected'.

[09:59] <m_athias> I'll put in a feedback requests. 

[10:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does this mean?

[12:20] <lizmat> And yet another Rakudo Weekly News hits the Net: https://rakudoweekly.blog/2022/01/24/2022-04-unsigned-merge/

[14:04] <zmoment> hi, I've never programmed in Perl but I'm considering Raku for a new project.  I've got some questions and I'd appreciate some guidance.

[14:05] <zmoment> Regarding consuming REST APIs with Json responses what modules (or language constructs) would you recommend?

[14:07] <zmoment> As for building a GUI, I've some experience with Tk, is it supported in Raku as in Perl5?

[14:09] <zmoment> Are there tools to build an Android app with Raku?

[14:09] *** frost left

[14:41] <lizmat> RST API's:  https://cro.services

[14:43] <lizmat> perhaps: https://raku.land/github:finanalyst/Inform or https://raku.land/cpan:MARTIMM/Gnome::Gtk3 ?

[14:44] <lizmat> re Android: not to my knowledge

[14:44] <lizmat> zmoment ^^

[14:54] <zmoment> Thank you lizmat

[15:36] <guifa> Has anyone gotten a good compile of Rakudo on ART?  That'd be the first step, but I don't know of any work there

[17:45] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> anyone on a mac here? Trying to confirm if LWP::Simple is broken: https://github.com/raku-community-modules/LWP-Simple

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I can't get any output from `my $out = LWP::Simple.get('https://raku.org');`

[17:46] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I have the SSL module installed

[17:47] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I don't get any errors or any indication anything is wrong. I just get no return value from the get() call

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> I will check on linux.

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> it doesn't do anything

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> huh

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> you are better off with `get` from `www`

[17:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what do you mean from `www`? www.raku.org?

[18:01] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> oh this? https://raku.land/github:raku-community-modules/WWW

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I wonder how LWP got so broken. You would think a simple test would catch an obvious problem like that.

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> what are these "community modules" anyway? I keep seeing them.

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I ran into another that seemed to be more or less broken as well

[18:04] <lizmat> raku community modules are basically those modules in the ecosystem that have been abandoned by the original author

[18:04] <lizmat> and which are waiting for a new maintainer for some TLC

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, that's what I might have guessed

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i guess the world has moved on from LWP::Simple anyway

[18:09] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> kind of an old workhorse from early perl days

[18:10] <lizmat> fwiw, I've become on the one hand pretty enamored by Cro

[18:10] <lizmat> but also by just doing: (run "curl", $url, :out, :!err).out.slurp(:close)   -)

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, I don't quite understand the frameworks like Cro and Mojolicious. I have to learn about them. I want to do Cro myelf.

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, I'm going to poke around with LWP::Simple just as an exercise and see if I can figure out what's broken.

[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> beats doing random tutorials

[18:14] <lizmat> stevied++

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, it works for other URLs like https://nytimes.com

[18:34] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I think raku.org is just probably blocking my nameless user agent

[19:34] *** lizmat left
[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, so the module is just very poorly documented, AFAICT

[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'll add a little to it
