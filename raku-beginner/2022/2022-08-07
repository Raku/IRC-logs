[00:52] <deoac> How do you reference a parent attribute with the same name from an inherited object?

[00:52] <deoac>     class A { has $.foo = 1};

[00:54] <deoac>     class B is A { has $.foo = 2};

[00:54] <deoac>     my $b = B.new;

[00:54] <deoac>     say $b.foo;  # 2

[00:54] <deoac>     say $b.A.foo; # error;

[00:54] <deoac> How do I get that last statement to output '1'?

[01:23] <guifa> deoac: by namespacing the method call

[01:23] <guifa> m: class A { has $.x = 1 }; class B is A { has $.x = 2 }; my $c = B.new; say $c.x; say $c.A::x;

[01:24] <guifa> but that feels pretty code smelly (with methods less so, admittedly)
