[08:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't think it's generally a good idea to use these assertions in grammars

[11:27] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> why is that?

[11:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because it doesn't really fit the concept of context-free grammars and such

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> eventually, you have tokens and a set of tokens are covered by one rule

[11:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> the tokens belong to exactly one term in a matching. not zero, not multiple

[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> well, my grammar would be a lot more comlicated without it

[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i want to distinguish between a line that begins with one # sign and one that has more than one

[11:36] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so the lookahead ensures the next character isn't a '#`

[11:47] *** razetime joined
[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> why don't you just consume the '#', though?

[11:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it is part of your grammar, after all. It's a legitimate token.

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> because I want to give a line with 2 or more pound signs a different meaning

[11:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that still sounds like a grammar design problem

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> since Raku grammars are PEGs from what I heard, you could just match to that different meaning first, hence only the single '#' reaches that meaning

[11:56] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i don't know what a PEG is

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> parse expression grammar or sth like that

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

[11:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> dang

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> dunno, all I know is that this will make processing the lines with actions easier for me

[11:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Not sure if it's worth it, though

[12:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> since it's not really compatible with the underlying grammar concept, there can be caveats
