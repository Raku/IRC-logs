[04:03] <jaguart> I have a child-class inheriting from parent - I want to set an arg to the parent's constructor if it is not currently set - but cannot work out the syntax

[04:10] <jaguart> in my child B I have ``multi method new( |arg ) {...}`` but I cannot seem to update the arg Capture before calling nextsame

[05:31] <jaguart> lizmat++ to the rescue - Acme::Cow::Stegosaurus ===> method new(|c) { callwith( |c, over => 20 ) }

[05:40] <jaguart> whan you can't find it in the docs - look for a dinosaur example

[20:51] <equinox> hi

[20:51] <equinox> m: my $s = now; my @a = |(1, 2, 3) xx 7_000; my \N = 1; for ^N { flat map * / 7, @a }; say (now - $s) / N

[20:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 665375bab: OUTPUT: «0.040333395␤»

[20:52] <equinox> ^this is some operation, done for N = 1 times, and timed

[20:52] <equinox> now I do with N = 100:

[20:52] <equinox> m: my $s = now; my @a = |(1, 2, 3) xx 7_000; my \N = 100; for ^N { flat map * / 7, @a }; say (now - $s) / N

[20:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 665375bab: OUTPUT: «0.014458232920000001␤»

[20:52] <equinox> so i guess there's some optimization; any way to disable that?

[20:52] <equinox> BTW, i'm not complaning or anything at all!

[20:53] <equinox> i sometimes see some environment variables passed around, maybe they are to do with that but not sure...

[20:56] <equinox> tried to capture the result, it got even faster :\)
