[06:23] <habere-et-disper> Can one declare a sub identifier with an alias?

[06:23] <habere-et-disper> I see you can do it with parameters, but I was wanting it on the sub itself to have a short and long name version.

[06:37] *** Kaiepi joined
[06:39] <Kaiepi> m: my &short := sub shortened-name(--> Nil) { }; say short; say shortened-name

[13:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Is there a web framework for Raku?

[13:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes, it is called Cro

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Made by possibly the only full-time Raku devs at Edument

[14:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> only that I know of, at least

[14:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Ulti> <@179666061795262464> if you're looking for an ORM to go with I'd give Red a look.

[14:30] <SmokeMachine> I also like Red! :)

[14:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> SmokeMachine aka FCO is the creator of Red - sorry for spoiling it, folks üòõ

[14:32] <SmokeMachine> :)

[14:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> What‚Äôs red? Another framework?

[14:37] <SmokeMachine> It‚Äôs an ORM https://fco.github.io/Red/

[14:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Ulti> yeah for abstracting database storage with business logic classes

[18:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I asked this questions since I want to create a small wattpad clone where you can save and create books/novels/ect. I know Raku is great for text processing, but how good is it with images? People would most likely want to upload images for their books

[18:45] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I asked this questions since I want to create a small wattpad clone where you can save and create books/novels/ect. I know Raku is great for text processing, but how good is it with images? People would most likely want to upload covers for their books

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Hm... Raku does not process images "natively" (as it does with text.) There are some libraries for dealing with SVG.

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> For what you are trying to do you might be better off using Mathematica.

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> For what you are trying to do you might be better off using Mathematica. üôÇ

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Is there a Mathematica web framework??? üòÑ

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> It is in my todo list to make a Raku DSL package for image processing.

[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Yes -- see wolfram.cloud and wolfram Web API.

[19:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Back to <@179666061795262464> question üôÇ -- Raku is good with CLI, so, if you are on macOS you can use Siri Shortcuts for image processing via Raku.

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> <@694526400488669234> thanks for answer! I don‚Äôt really want to do anything complicated with images, just upload them/get them from somewhere else and show it in the app(or well, web page in my case) Is it really that hard for Raku to so right now?

[19:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I‚Äôm sorry if I sound dumb, I don‚Äôt know how image processing works

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> <@179666061795262464> - suggest you take a look at this two part blog https://deathbykeystroke.com/articles/20220224-building-a-cro-app-part-1.html ... also raku.land is written in Raku/Cro https://gitlab.com/raku-land/raku-land IMO Raku/Cro is quite bare bones compared to other frameworks - it is no Ruby on Rails (yet).

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@179666061795262464> Uploading and, more generally, managing files with Raku is / should be easy.

[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> @anton - can you point us to any example code?

[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@928301352029937715> Of managing files with Raku? Or doing data wrangling in Python via Raku?

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Eg. a working Raku/Cro example with image upload

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@928301352029937715> You are one of the primary audience members of these notebooks: https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/tree/main/Notebooks/Jupyter . I think it might be a good idea to accumulate ***Raku*** notebooks for doing different "everyday" type of tasks.

[19:43] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> Yes, but I think the ask is for a Raku framework to build a website with an image upload function

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <p6steve> ;-)

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@928301352029937715> Yeah, sure, I will do it after I record the "Raku-spin" version of my main presentation at Wolfram Technology Conference last week.

[19:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> <@928301352029937715> I am not sure how much the notebooks are "embraced" by the current, typical Raku user, but the "young generation" definitely has a taste of using notebooks.

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> I have another project in mind for now to test Raku, and for the web page I‚Äôll just wait (maybe make it myself someday lol) for it to appear. Thanks for the help everyone!

[22:36] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> echo, it should print something in the console/shell. I confirm that it work on the cmd and powershell

[22:47] <habere-et-disper> I found another way to make a sub alias:

[22:47] <habere-et-disper> sub long-name ( |params ) { short-name |params }

[22:47] <habere-et-disper> Does that look sound?

[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Do I need to create a new sub for that? I just want to know why `run 'echo', "hello"` doesnt work on my computer.

[22:52] <habere-et-disper> I don't think so:

[22:52] <habere-et-disper> m: run <echo hello>

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar a98f1cabe: OUTPUT: ¬´The spawned command 'echo' exited unsuccessfully (exit code: 1, signal: 0)‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[23:02] <guifa_>  habere-et-disper: that works, but will add an extra level of dispatch

[23:09] <habere-et-disper> Maybe `echo` is not available on your system? Try at an interactive shell prompt: `$ which echo`

[23:11] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I can confirm that it fails on Windows, by the way

[23:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> my bet would be that `echo` is not a program on windows <@179666061795262464>

[23:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> it might be some cmd built-in

[23:15] <habere-et-disper> I think on unix it is a binary in /bin/echo, but on windows it is part of the shell, so you can try:

[23:15] <habere-et-disper> `run <cmd echo hello>'

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> You guys are most likely right, since dir does work but echo doesn't work outside the cmd itself.

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> in which case you can fall back to direct shell invocation, either with `shell` or the qx quoting

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> `my $name = 'Sir Gates'; shell "echo 'Hello $name'";`

[23:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> for me, that just downright opened a cmd session

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you want to obtain the process, `shell` is a safe bet

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> it's `where` on windows

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> update: shell "echo 'hello'" works perfectly

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Superstart033> Gonna try this

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> if you want to obtain the standard output, `qx[]` and friends are the way to go

[23:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> instead of `which`

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> `echo` just exists as part of `git` for me

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> "could not find file(s) for the given pattern"

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Kaiepi> `where /R C:\ echo` or wherever

[23:19] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> yeah cygwin does have echo

[23:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> but `where cmd`Àôfor example does return cmd.exe under System32
