[19:27] <rcmlz> lizmat: in the weekly news I red about a link you suggested https://climbtheladder.com/10-raku-best-practices/ and there I found:

[19:27] <rcmlz> 8. Incorporate automated testing frameworks such as Test::META and Test::Routine

[19:27] <rcmlz> ...

[19:27] <rcmlz> Test::Routine is another automated testing framework for Raku. It provides an easy-to-use API for writing unit tests, which makes it easier to write comprehensive tests quickly.

[19:27] <rcmlz> ...

[19:27] <rcmlz> However, I am unable to find Test::Routine in https://raku.land/ - and consequently "zef install Test::Routine" also fails.

[19:27] <rcmlz> Strange, right? Fun fact: the author Agnes Mayer is apparently big in ceramics, clay and potery.

[19:27] <rcmlz> Is that just a somehow autogenerated article?

[23:02] <lizmat> rcmlz: yes, it looks like that, that's why it says now: "Out of the blue in what appears to be most likely ChatGPT generated" in the weekly
