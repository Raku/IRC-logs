[22:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I have a MAIN function with a default argument, I tried to pass that argument to a sub as `rw` but apparently it had no container. What am I doing wrong?

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> hm, it wasn't even default, it was a normal argument

[23:00] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> a string argument

[23:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> maybe I should make the arguments in question `is rw` as well, if that can work

[23:05] <MasterDuke> does it need to be `is rw` or can it be `is copy`?

[23:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It has to be `is copy` according to the warning of Rakudo, makes sense

[23:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> although rw command-line arguments would be quite some premier ðŸ˜„

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Also... I'm pretty sure I've asked about this before

[23:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is there a way to distribute Raku programs in a "you barely need to install anything to run this" way?

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> does anyone know how to make the tab button make tabs in Comma?

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> and change the tabstop to 3 spaces?

[23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <dynamite#1375> or am I doing this wrong? (I haven't set up a way to write arbitrary Unicode conveniently yet)
