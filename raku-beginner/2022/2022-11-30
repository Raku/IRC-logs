[09:49] <ToddAndMargo> anybody on newbie duty?

[09:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> what does that mean? üôÇ

[09:51] <ToddAndMargo> I posted my question over on http://vpaste.net/yVh5l

[09:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> oh no, I know nothing of NativeCall...

[09:55] <lizmat> ToddAndMargo: it's not a duty.  Nobody's getting paid for it.

[09:56] <ToddAndMargo> It was meant in jest!

[09:56] <lizmat> then add a smiley to what you say: person to person communication is difficult as it is, even more so if it is only text without any hints

[09:57] <ToddAndMargo> :-)

[09:57] <ToddAndMargo> You are extraordinary at all things Raku.¬† Were you able to figure out my Native Call question?

[09:59] <lizmat> sorry, I don't have enough experience with NativeCall to give you an answer

[09:59] <ToddAndMargo> But, But, But.

[10:00] <ToddAndMargo> Should I re-post over on the main channel?

[10:06] <ToddAndMargo> I will log off here and re-post on the main channel

[12:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> @lizmat "App:Rak"  "saved me" a few times this week...

[12:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov> Where I can read more about making Raku apps? Is "App::" special in some way within Raku, or it is "just a convention" to publish apps in "App::" ?

[12:55] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> I think it's just a convention but someone will correct me if I'm wrong üôÇ

[13:01] <lizmat> just a convention

[13:02] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: glad to hear  :-)

[19:33] <discord-raku-bot> <South> why does something like `"0123456789"[5]` fail?

[19:39] *** jgaz joined
[19:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Because strings are not lists

[19:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/language/traps#Strings_are_not_Lists,_so_beware_indexing

[19:43] <lizmat> m: say "0123456789".comb[5]

[19:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> https://docs.raku.org/routine/comb if you want to obtain a sequence of characters, as Liz illustrated

[19:52] <discord-raku-bot> <South> yeah thats what i did to circumvent, was just curious

[19:53] <discord-raku-bot> <South> this might be the first language ive used that doesnt have regular ol string indexing with `[]`

[19:54] <lizmat> https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Pythonic::Str   

[19:55] <lizmat> will let you do that  :-)

[19:55] <discord-raku-bot> <South> haha cool, thanks

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> the Zoffix legacy

[19:56] <lizmat> yup

[19:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> this Sourcery module immediately became my favorite

[20:01] *** sgrs joined
[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> Yes, I've seen this but didn't fully understand how it's used.

[20:11] <lizmat> if the synopsis isn't clear enough, I would be glad to accept suggestions for it  :-)
