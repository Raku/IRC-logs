[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> I need to check a string for certain characters, count them, keep them counted in their certain category, and also make my code die if invalid characters are in the string

[15:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> I would like to use a bag

[15:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> and elem

[17:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> what are you having issue with it seems like it would work

[17:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> what are you having issue with it seems like it would work @Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266

[18:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> Not sure how to code out the bag, *, grep, comb, anything else

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> i mean you can coerce the bag into a hash and then just use it as normal ```pl

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> my %h = <3 4 5 3 2 1 6 2 6 6 6>.Bag;

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> say %h{6};

[18:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> ```

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> usually if you want to see the entire object you can apply `dd` on it

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> ```pl

[18:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> dd <3 4 5 3 2 1 6 2 6 6 6>.Bag

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i'm trying to do things in a more raku-like manner and not use loops

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> so i have this:

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> `$dom_post.find('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6').map(*.text).list.is_copy ~~ s/\+.*//;`

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> i want to modify the text in header tags

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> but the string is immutable

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> any way around that?

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> the is_copy is my futitle attempt to address the problem. just throws an error

[18:23] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I know it's `is copy`

[21:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> I solved the problem!

[21:41] <discord-raku-bot> <Hydrazer#4827> nice

[21:43] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> @stevied#8273 `.list` coerces to `List`, `.Array` may work.

[21:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Whaaat => Prince of Cows#5266> ty @Hydrazer#4827

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> ok, thanks, @gfldex#8222 . will try it out later. just went back to a loop for now. though I also .text method may just return an immutable string and there's not way to modify it. not sure.

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> seems kind of silly that it can't be changed easily with the Dom::Tiny

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <gfldex#8222> Threads don't like mutability.

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> yeah, that's something on my list to learn. threading. shit.

[22:12] <discord-raku-bot> <stevied#8273> I think I tried light weight threads once with perl maybe 15 years ago. not sure it can sill be done in perl
