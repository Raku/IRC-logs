[02:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> you can mark the elements as nodal

[02:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> you could probably hack around it with the `nodal` trait

[02:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> but that trait applies on individual methods

[02:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Rogue#2017> I'm not sure how you'd do that in a clean way tbh
