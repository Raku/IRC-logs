[00:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch> consider bindings which can trick it

[00:35] <guifa> Well yeah, but at that point there's nothing you can do

[00:36] <guifa> If you do my $a = 2; my $b := $a; report $b, there's going to be no way to access $b AFAIK

[00:36] <guifa> m: my $a = 2; my $b := $a; say $b.VAR.name
