[00:26] <melezhik> I am thinking about creating a sparrow plug that would execute a section(s) of Raku code from a module readme markdown file and in case no errors occurred mark an entire doc as a good (enough) doc in a sense at least it has some examples and they are executed without errors , eventually module authors can use a "good doc" badges for their modules

[00:26] <melezhik> from the SparrowCI site , the same way as now build badges work ... Is it something that could be useful ?
