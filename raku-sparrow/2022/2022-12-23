[17:37] <grondilu> melezhik: hi, what openssl version does your test environment use? 

[17:37] <melezhik> let me see, it's should be debian package ...

[17:38] <grondilu> hang on I need to relog

[17:38] *** grondilu left
[17:38] *** grondilu joined
[17:38] * grondilu is back

[17:40] <melezhik> grondilu - https://gist.github.com/melezhik/8c24cb6e5692cead55f96306faeddc86

[17:40] <melezhik> just in case we have logs stored in irclogs.raku ...

[17:41] <grondilu> I've just commented this https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-raku-tools/pull/1#issuecomment-1364142258

[17:42] <grondilu> so, openssl 1.1  No surprise here. It doesn't have the kdf command.

[17:42] <grondilu> what surprises me is that it doesn't skip the tests.

[17:42] <melezhik> ok, we have two options - tweak pipeline and try to install the latest version and do skip in your tests ...

[17:43] <grondilu> even in version 0.7.*

[17:43] <melezhik> > what surprises me is that it doesn't skip the tests. - yeah ...

[17:43] <melezhik> how you skip?

[17:43] <grondilu> https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-raku-tools/blob/655ef77e239c55b9a5cf7bb643ea5322f1847705/t/bip39.t#L46

[17:44] <grondilu> oh wait

[17:44] <grondilu> hang on

[17:45] <grondilu> it's not the appropriate method, my bad

[17:49] <grondilu> the thing is, this openssl test is hard for me to check as I have only one version of openssl

[17:49] <grondilu> I mean I could do a tweak or something, but that would be a hassle

[17:50] <grondilu> I've just pushed 0.7.2 anyway 

[17:52] <melezhik> ok

[17:52] <melezhik> you are using - my $openssl-version = qx{openssl version};

[17:53] <grondilu> yes, are system calls an issue?

[17:55] <melezhik> no, I am just asking just in case ...

[17:55] <melezhik> I need to check what this command outputs on container

[17:55] <melezhik> worker@224f9310a779:/$ openssl version

[17:55] <melezhik> OpenSSL 1.1.1n  15 Mar 2022

[17:56] <grondilu> yes, so it should skip to line 50 :         skip 'seed generation would be too slow without OpenSSL v3+';

[17:58] <grondilu> build 2296 succeeded apparently \o/

[17:59] <melezhik> ++

[18:00] <grondilu> gotta go, bye

[18:00] *** grondilu left
[18:02] <melezhik> yeah, see you!

[20:09] <melezhik> lizmat I remember when I played with my butterflies , I set up a notifications send to irc channel from my bot, I wonder how difficult it would be to do the same for this channel?

[20:10] <melezhik> I remember there was a problem that my VM from digital ocean IP address was blocked by libera ...

[20:11] <melezhik> so I had to do all this infra with additional irc bridge or whatever ...

[20:11] <melezhik> don't remember the exact name ...

[20:11] *** Geth joined
[20:12] <lizmat> melezhik: so if I understand your question correctly, you would like to have your commits be announced here ?

[20:13] <melezhik> not just my commits, just in general some messages I would like ci.sparrowhub.io send to there, say information about new builds , so on

[20:14] <lizmat> ok, now, for Github, you would need to set up a webhook

[20:14] <lizmat> payload URL would be: https://webhooks.liz.nl/?chan=%23raku-sparrow

[20:15] <lizmat> content-type:  application/json

[20:15] <lizmat> and you should be set now (I've instructed Geth tp be here as well)

[20:15] <lizmat> *to

[20:16] <melezhik> I can use this endpoint to send any message to #raku-sparrow ? not GH commits?

[20:17] <lizmat> well, as long as they supply the same JSON format, you could  :-)

[20:18] <lizmat> but it's only prepared for Github pushes in their JSON format

[20:18] <melezhik> interesting ... where can I get an information about this format?

[20:19] <lizmat> https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads

[20:19] <lizmat> knock yourself out  :-)

[20:19] <melezhik> thanks!

[20:20] <lizmat> BTW, not all of these messages are actually supported by Geth

[20:20] <lizmat> https://docs.github.com/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push *is* most definitely

[22:07] <melezhik> I have already send a test message from sparrowbot

[22:07] *** sparrowbot left
[22:09] <melezhik> the only hurdle that Digital ocean IPs seems are banned by libera

[22:10] <melezhik> so I will probably have to set up a proxy server (ZTC or something) on my the VM that hosts ci.sparrowhub.io or maybe will find some other way around ...
