[18:45] <patrickb> I'm probably missing the obvious, how do I `ORDER BY` in Red?

[18:55] <patrickb> Grepping through the source reveals some tests that do `.^all.sort().grep()`. I guess that's just what I need.

[20:30] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: yes, you can use `Model.^all.sort(*.column)`

[20:31] <SmokeMachine> Or `Model.^all.sort(-*.column)`

[20:35] <patrickb> oh! That's nice. Thanks for the tip!

[20:38] <SmokeMachine> ResultSeq has many useful methods: https://fco.github.io/Red/api/Red/ResultSeq
