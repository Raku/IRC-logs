[17:06] <samebchase> Hi, I have a Red model, in which a column is of the Json type, and can be null in some situations. When I fetch the rows, I get the "Use of uninitialized value element of type Any in string context." message printed on the console, seems to be coming from https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Type/Json.pm6#L5 where from-json is called on a

[17:06] <samebchase> Nil value. What can I do here, to prevent this from being printed. I'm trying various default values, but no luck so far.

[17:06] <samebchase> My code is similar to https://gist.github.com/samebchase/3b519f4d55f44ab58b26af346bc8f294

[17:10] <lizmat> It's not very busy here, but SmokeMachine hangs out here...  :-)

[17:15] <SmokeMachine> samebchase: Sorry, I'll have to take a look at it later today, after day job

[17:16] <SmokeMachine> samebchase: could you share how are you using that model to get that error, please?

[17:17] <samebchase> I can share the full code with you on email

[17:17] <samebchase> Turns out, its https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/438 still happening on latest Raku and latest Red (unless I am doing something horribly wrong)

[17:35] <samebchase> Okay, I have been able to reproduce it, let me share a gist here

[17:38] <samebchase> https://gist.github.com/samebchase/48107b480d771d42bb00771bb4520fdf

[17:39] <samebchase> It happens when a JSON field has a nested field which is NULL. 

[17:39] <samebchase> Here I was thinking it happens when the entire JSON field itself is NULL

[17:39] <samebchase> , but this happens on nested fields.

[17:39] <samebchase> This is PG, btw

[17:41] <SmokeMachine> does that work on SQLite as well?

[17:41] <SmokeMachine> I mean: does that happens on SQLite as well?

[17:42] <SmokeMachine> *happen sorry

[18:09] <SmokeMachine> just reproduced! https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/iUY08njy/image.png

[21:38] <SmokeMachine> samebchase: I finally fixed that! sorry for the delay!
