[09:05] <patrickb> o/

[09:05] <patrickb> I found another enum bug

[09:05] <patrickb> https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/52c482d25fa0eb074efe2a8101949695

[09:06] <SmokeMachine> Hi! What’s the error that gives?

[09:13] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: is this what you are getting? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6GPz6FYQ/

[09:14] <patrickb> Type check failed in assignment to $!e; expected E but got E::E1

[09:14] <patrickb>   in method new at /home/patrickb/rrepos/install/share/perl6/site/sources/31359EAA52B95E59401770AFEC03556C7839FDC2 (Red::Model) line 25

[09:14] <patrickb>   in block <unit> at foo.raku line 11

[09:14] <SmokeMachine> I don't think that will be hard to fix. But I'll need to leave that for after $DAYJOB...

[09:14] <patrickb> Yes.

[09:15] <patrickb> :-) No pressure at all please. I'm impressed that you answered that quick at all!

[09:15] <SmokeMachine> :)

[09:16] <SmokeMachine> But that's probably related to Red's own type check... so, that's probably just the case of adding a special handling for Enumerations or (better) comparing how Raked dos that and stealing the code... :)

[09:20] <patrickb> I just updated the gist. I'm confused.

[09:36] <SmokeMachine> ok, it seems it will be even easier to fix... it seems I'm jut not decontainerising the value...

[09:36] <SmokeMachine> (Sorry I've also copied the comments)

[09:37] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: but the answer deconting it seems right

[09:38] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: would you like to PR the fix for that? It's probably just the case of adding `.<>` on the methods return...

[09:39] <patrickb> I got a local patch that makes it work. It just assigns `col.type` to a temporary var and uses that for matching.

[09:39] <patrickb> I'll see what I can do.

[09:40] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: ☝️ seems to work... it just need to be inside the method...

[10:03] <patrickb> PR is up.

[10:05] <SmokeMachine> That looks good! Can I ask you another favour? Would you mind on adding that code as a test, please?

[10:07] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: ☝️ sorry for asking that

[10:38] <patrickb> Will do!

[10:59] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: thank you very much!

[11:01] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: I'll merge it as soon as the tests finish running

[11:18] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: done, thanks! later today I'll release it

[11:37] <patrickb> Thank you!
