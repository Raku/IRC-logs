[15:36] <patrickb> SmokeMachine: I think it's working now! \o/

[16:21] <SmokeMachine> \o/ great! I‚Äôll do a release as soon as possible

[16:49] <patrickb> How do I generate a limit? i.e. return the first 20 rows?

[17:10] <SmokeMachine> .head(20)

[17:11] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: üëÜ

[17:27] <japhb> I love how when someone asks how you do something in Red, my first guess is the right answer.  Intuitive++

[17:28] <SmokeMachine> :) that‚Äôs the intent! :)

[17:28] <japhb> Is paging .skip(N).head(M) ?

[17:30] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking about that right now‚Ä¶ it should be like that‚Ä¶ but for some reason I made it wrong and made it .from(N).head(M)‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fixing it now‚Ä¶ adding an alias‚Ä¶

[17:33] <japhb> Ah, nice

[17:33] <SmokeMachine> but you can also paginate with `Model.^all.batch(20)[3]` for the 4th page with 20 items each...

[17:36] <japhb> Also nice.  :-)

[17:38] <SmokeMachine> that's the first example from the "cookbook": https://fco.github.io/Red/tutorials/cookbook.html

[17:45] <SmokeMachine> Could you people see if you Messi any case that should be on cookbook, please?

[17:58] <SmokeMachine> japhb: skip should work now: https://github.com/FCO/Red/commit/1609f811b842266347f5b369a8b790a26cd77b2f

[18:26] <japhb> SmokeMachine++

[18:26] <SmokeMachine> japhb: :)

[18:29] <SmokeMachine> japhb: I forgot to mention, Red has a "Ecosystem test" that try to install all modules that have Red as dependency on the ecosystem to let me know if any of my changes has broken any module. For some reason (I don't remember), I've added MUGS::Core as an exception and it wasn't testing it... I've removed that exception know and running the test, ok?

[18:32] <SmokeMachine> :( https://github.com/FCO/Red/runs/6956932392?check_suite_focus=true

[18:34] <japhb> Gah.  I'll do my build runs and see if I get the same error.  Sounds like ye olde expiring cert.  :eyeroll:

[18:35] <SmokeMachine> japhb: I'll add the exception for now if you don't mind... :)

[18:36] <japhb> Certainly.

[18:47] <SmokeMachine> currently there are 2 modules not being tested: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/.red-ecosystem-errors

[18:48] <SmokeMachine> I should make it possible le to add the reason why those are not being tested...

[18:48] <japhb> Good idea

[18:49] <japhb> You know, every time I see Rakudo's build message "Installed 20 core modules in 14.123456789 seconds!" I always think "There is no machine on which the timing of that operation could be nanosecond-exact."

[19:03] <lizmat> japhb: yeah, that could be better  :-)

[19:03] <lizmat> it's just that the nano-second accuracy was added later  :-)

[19:06] <japhb> :-)

[19:09] <SmokeMachine> üëç

[19:41] <japhb> SmokeMachine: Everything built fine on Rakudo 2022.06-21-gd253dc79e

[19:41] <japhb> Actually wait ... stuff I have locally checked out may not run tests.  Let me force that.

[19:44] <japhb> Crap.  Yep, Cro::CBOR throws an error.

[19:44] <japhb> Dang it.

[19:51] <japhb> Refreshed certs indeed fixes it.  Looks like I need to update to current release standards too.

[19:58] <japhb> OK, new Cro::CBOR 0.0.4 released

[20:00] <SmokeMachine> Now the exceptions accept a reason... I'll remove the exception and try again just after passing the tests of this new commit (https://github.com/FCO/Red/commit/60016ea198a6279f998b1828238a5637d359830d)

[20:00] <japhb> Sounds good

[20:07] <japhb> Bah.  Anyone know how to deal with the MacOS "loading libcrypto in an unsafe way" failure on GHA?  https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/runs/6957373377?check_suite_focus=true

[20:10] <SmokeMachine> japhb: https://github.com/FCO/Red/runs/6957413833?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:34

[20:24] <japhb> Anyone know how to deal with the MacOS "loading libcrypto in an unsafe way" failure on GHA?   https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/runs/6957373377?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:5

[20:25] <japhb> Sorry, was trying to send to another channel
