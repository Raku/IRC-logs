[16:19] <patrickb> How can I set a DateTime column to NULL? Neither `Nil`, nor `DateTime` work...

[17:27] <SmokeMachine> What happens when you ser Nil to it?

[17:38] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: it seems it's not for DateTime only: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xnCKDly6/CleanShot%202022-06-17%20at%2018.37.37%402x.png

[18:03] <SmokeMachine> I fixed that locally, but I'm trying to fix it if a default was provided, (for example: `has Int $.bla is default(42)`)

[18:12] <SmokeMachine> I'll leave it without default for now...

[19:17] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: Fix and released! :) Thank you for letting me know about that!

[19:29] <patrickb> Oh! Thank you! I didn't expect it to be a bug.

[19:30] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: could you try it, please?

[19:38] <patrickb> In RCB it doesn't seem to work yet. Will try out a minimal example.

[19:50] <SmokeMachine> RCB?

[21:03] <patrickb> Rakudo CI bot

[21:03] <patrickb> The project where I'm using Red.

[21:06] <patrickb> It does work in a minimal example. I suspect it's working in SQLite and broken in Pg

[21:18] <patrickb> This is the reproduction.

[21:21] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/RakudoCIBot  <- That's the RCB. Still in progress, but nearing completion.

[21:24] <patrickb> Thanks for all the work you put into Red!

[23:17] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: I think I found the problem!

[23:18] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: about the work I put on Red... I just wanted that was enough...
