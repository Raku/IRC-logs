[03:45] <japhb> That feels like a level too much of magic.

[04:08] <SmokeMachine> Yes… maybe…

[10:50] <leont> Yeah

[11:08] <lizmat> a .sink could warn the resuls are lost ?

[11:09] <lizmat> and/or have an autosave option ?

[11:20] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking on autosaveing… but the warn is a great idea!
