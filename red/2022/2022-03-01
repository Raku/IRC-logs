[18:03] <japhb> SmokeMachine: Red seems to be failing install on Rakudo head.

[18:04] <SmokeMachine> Really? :(

[18:05] <SmokeMachine> japhb : Do you have the error? I’m not able to try it out now…

[18:05] <japhb> Yeah, it wouldn't compile because "On Red:api<2> references must declaire :model-name (or :model-type) and the references block must receive the model as reference"

[18:06] <SmokeMachine> Does it say on what error it happened?

[18:08] <japhb> Mind you, https://gist.github.com/japhb/506effd33e6904d9d331fe763f6e0677

[18:08] <japhb> Mind you?  Don't know what that was from

[18:09] <japhb> But the gist should give info.  :-)

[18:09] <SmokeMachine> japhb: thank you very much!

[18:11] <japhb> Sure!
