[19:03] <SmokeMachine> japhb: it seems I found the difference...

[19:03] <SmokeMachine> this used to be true:

[19:03] <SmokeMachine> m: my %column = :references, :model-name; say so(%column{<model-name model-type>.none}:exists) == so(%column{<model-name model-type>.all}:!exists)

[19:08] <SmokeMachine> It seems I've fixed that in Red... committing in a sec...

[19:11] <japhb> Ah, cool.

[19:13] <japhb> Would you mind commenting on the bug when you've got it worked around?  (It would be good to nail down if this is a regression on something that really should work, or just a change in something that happened to work.)

[19:19] <SmokeMachine> done

[22:02] <SmokeMachine> it must be fixed now... just need to wait zef to update its clan list

[22:02] <SmokeMachine> *cpan

[22:05] <japhb> FWIW, you should probably convert to zef/fez upload at some point soonish.  Looks like the plan to phase out CPAN over the next year will probably be approved.

[22:06] <SmokeMachine> yes... I'm planing to do it... but I need some time to do it...

[22:07] <japhb> Nodnod.  Thankfully, with mi6 now natively supporting the Zef ecosystem, it gets a bit easier.
