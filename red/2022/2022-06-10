[15:39] <SmokeMachine> hi!

[15:40] <patrickb> I just bumped the deps of RakudoCIBot. Rakudo to 2022.04 and Red to 0.1.60.

[15:40] <patrickb> Now I get `On Red:api<2> references must declaire :model-name (or :model-type) and the references block must receive the model as reference`

[15:40] <patrickb> o/ SmokeMachine! Long time no read

[15:41] <patrickb> My first guess would be https://github.com/FCO/Red/commit/f664df0a16d761c6631b09bd44fcc1bda31bd1e0

[15:42] <patrickb> The referenced line of code reads `has UInt $!fk-platform-test-set is referencing( *.id, :model(DB::CIPlatformTestSet) );`. I think it's fine.

[15:42] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: :)  is there a way to me to take a look at the model's code?

[15:42] <patrickb> https://github.com/Raku/RakudoCIBot/blob/main/lib/DB.rakumod

[15:42] <patrickb> Sure :-)

[15:42] <SmokeMachine> ok, odd... it seems to be doing the right thing (the line I mean)

[15:42] <patrickb> You're always so quick to answer...

[15:43] <SmokeMachine> :)

[15:43] <SmokeMachine> let me take a look...

[15:49] <SmokeMachine> the first thing I got using that code was: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hJKkBNcY/image.png

[15:49] <SmokeMachine> sorry... of course...

[15:50] <SmokeMachine> sorry... let me clone it...

[16:02] <patrickb> Oh. I think I found it. Failure on my side.

[16:02] <SmokeMachine> really? what was it?

[16:02] <patrickb> There was a `-I/home/patrickb/repos/Red` in my startup script.

[16:03] <patrickb> I didn't pull in that repo and assumed just installing latest Red would suffice to use the latest version.

[16:04] <patrickb> So what happended is using new Rakudo with old Red *without* https://github.com/FCO/Red/commit/f664df0a16d761c6631b09bd44fcc1bda31bd1e0

[16:05] <patrickb> Just removing that bit and thus actually using Red v0.1.60 works.

[16:05] <patrickb> Sorry for wasting your time. /o\

[16:05] <SmokeMachine> great that works!

[16:06] <SmokeMachine> that wasn't waste of time at all!! I'm always happy of listening/reading about people using Red! :)

[16:06] <patrickb> :-)

[16:08] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: is there something you are missing on Red? Something that would be really good to get implemented?

[16:11] <patrickb> I'm still waiting on https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/495 but it's easy to work around, so it's not urgent.

[16:11] <SmokeMachine> (I know there are a lot missing, but what would be the most important one?)

[16:13] <SmokeMachine> would you believe I have forgotten about that? I'm sorry...

[16:14] <patrickb> As I said, not urgent, so don't worry.

[16:14] <SmokeMachine> I've added that on beta release project...

[16:25] <SmokeMachine> I think I'm going to merge this PR (https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/496) to fix that issue for now... and when I have some time I'll implement the way I was thinking it...

[16:25] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: ^^

[16:27] <patrickb> Yay!

[17:00] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: would you mind on testing it out, please?

[18:12] <patrickb> Replacing all `*.whatever âŠ‚ (SOME::ENUM, )` with `*.whatever == SOME::ENUM` compiles and runs. At least on first look it seems to also do the right thing.

[18:12] <patrickb> \o/

[18:12] <patrickb> Thank you!

[19:45] <SmokeMachine> \o/
