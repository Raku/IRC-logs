[08:57] <SmokeMachine> Hi. A new version of Red was just released. On this new version, you can make relationship blocks receive 2 arguments (the model/object it self and the related model) to build more complex joinsâ€¦ as an example, the 2nd example on `Source and Source-id` on the cookbook: https://fco.github.io/Red/tutorials/cookbook.html
