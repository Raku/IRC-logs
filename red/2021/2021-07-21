[14:43] <ecocode> Hi, is it correct that Red does not support MySQL ?

[15:01] <SmokeMachine> ecocode: not yet, but I'm working on it: https://github.com/FCO/Red-Driver-MySQL

[15:05] <ecocode> great !

[15:05] <ecocode> is that already testable ?

[15:23] <SmokeMachine> I haven't written tests yet, so I haven't found the problems yet...

[15:24] <SmokeMachine> ecocode: so, if you'd like to try it out and open issues about what you found out, that would be very helpful...

[15:34] <SmokeMachine> ecocode: and please, let me know if you test it!

[15:35] <ecocode> ok, I'll keep you informed if I do
