[05:00] <japhb> FYI, Red is failing to install on Rakudo HEAD (rakudo-moar-2021.06-83-g853dc3936).  Haven't yet checked whether it's Red or Rakudo that changed.

[07:01] <SmokeMachine> japhb: would you mind to paste here the log message, please?

[17:20] <SmokeMachine> ok, it seems to be working on 2020.12... updating my raku and retrying...

[17:46] <SmokeMachine> it installed on my rakubrew installation (moar-2020.12)

[17:46] <SmokeMachine> I'll have to test it on my personal computer

[17:50] <SmokeMachine> sorry, I've done that wrong... I'm trying again...

[18:17] <japhb> Welp, that's broken ...

[18:19] <SmokeMachine> it seems there is a deprecated code on my test...

[18:20] <SmokeMachine> or is it on mi6 itself?

[18:21] <SmokeMachine> I've ran `mi6 test` on a different module and it showed the same message about deprecated code...

[18:23] <SmokeMachine> it seems to not be a Red's only problem... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ykuUK8oT/image.png

[19:28] <japhb> That seems pretty broken, yeah.  Is that a current Zef?

[19:29] <SmokeMachine> Yesâ€¦
