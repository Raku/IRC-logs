[19:59] <SmokeMachine> Hi!

[19:59] <patrickb> I had another go at my Red model. It seems enums currently can't be grepped on. The resulting SQL simply has `WHERE 0`

[20:00] <SmokeMachine> Could you give me an example, please?

[20:01] <SmokeMachine> If possible open an issue?

[20:01] <patrickb> Will do :-)

[20:22] <patrickb> Minimal test case works. Needs more investigating...

[20:40] <SmokeMachine> Whatâ€™s that minimal test case?

[20:47] <patrickb> https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1335520 <- updated with one more failure case

[21:45] <SmokeMachine> I didn't remember about the refreshable experimental feature, thanks for remembering me about that
