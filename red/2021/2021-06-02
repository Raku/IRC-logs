[19:12] <SmokeMachine> Hi!
[19:23] <lizmat> sorry if I seemed to be talking to myself, but I was testing some live chat update code for the logs server, and suddenly everybody went quiet :-)
[19:25] <SmokeMachine> np‚Ä¶ I was trying to help‚Ä¶ sorry for that‚Ä¶
[19:28] <lizmat> You did  :-) by saying something  :-)
[20:02] <japhb> "something"
[20:06] <lizmat> now I just have to wait about 4 hours to see whether it will correctly handle the change of UTC date  :-)
[20:12] <japhb> I wonder how long you can play the Jeopardy song before it causes insanity ...
[20:18] <lizmat> ah, and then the special handling for a new year  :-)

[22:12] <japhb> SmokeMachine: What's the intended use of redable?  Is it essentially a Camelia with Red loaded?
[22:12] <SmokeMachine> yes... mostly... but it's more to study...
