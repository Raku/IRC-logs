[21:03] <SmokeMachine> :)
[21:06] <japhb> Why the smile, SmokeMachine?
[21:06] <japhb> (I mean, besides just being in a good mood or so.)
[21:07] <SmokeMachine> I'm happy on seeing you all here! :)
[21:18] <japhb> :-)
[23:05] <SmokeMachine> I've being playing with this (https://github.com/FCO/CroX-Red-JsonAPI), if some one gets interested to take a look...
[23:29] <japhb> Looks like it's a CRUD helper?
[23:31] <japhb> Also, I've been working on CBOR::Simple (https://github.com/japhb/CBOR-Simple), which provides a richer (and more compact) data model than available in JSON.
[23:31] <japhb> I also have a Cro::CBOR module more or less ready to go when the new Cro is released, so Cro users can specify :cbor as easily as they specify :json.
