[21:37] <arkiuat> well, I just got the "Cannot unbox a type object (Str) to a str." compilation error on an install attempt, installing Test::Coverage, in compiling Iterables-0.0.4/t/01-basic.rakutest:1

[21:37] <arkiuat> HOWEVER

[21:38] <arkiuat> when I ran `RAKUDO_OPT="--ll-exception" zef install Test::Coverage --debug` (which I did immediately), Test::Coverage (and ForwardIterables) installed cleanly without complaint

[21:39] <arkiuat> so yeah, it's still proving difficult to reproduce. If it never happens when I have debug mode on, though, I won't be too upset :D

[22:00] <ugexe> do you happen to have any other rakudo environment variables set, particularly those like RAKULIB, RAKUDOLIB, etc?

[22:18] <arkiuat> This is embarrassing, but yes, RAKULIB was still set to .

[22:18] <arkiuat> I don't know how, that isn't in any of my dotfiles anymore and hasn't been for days now

[22:18] <arkiuat> anyway, I'll keep an eye out for that. It isn't set anymore now

[22:19] <arkiuat> the only other Raku environment variable that I have is RAKUDO_LINE_EDITOR, which I hope is innocuous

[22:22] <arkiuat> Thank you! I just installed two more modules without experiencing the problem

[22:22] <arkiuat> (after making sure RAKULIB was not set)

[22:22] <ugexe> the issue was almost certainly to due rakulib being set to .

[22:23] <arkiuat> Right

[22:27] <ugexe> there is obviously some weird issue in rakudo related to precomp and module loading, but now you know how to avoid it

[22:27] <ugexe> thats why it happens the first time you do something and not the follow up times: after the first time it has presumably precompiled some stuff in . (i.e. RAKULIB)

[22:30] <arkiuat> which would leave random .precomp dirs scattered about.  I probably want to delete the ones that aren't where they belong
