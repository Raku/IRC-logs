[13:47] <[Coke]> Hey - for the occasional issues I have installing packages with zef on windows, would it be possible to create a flag or env var that attempted to use smaller paths where it was under zef's control? (I assume the answer to this is "no, the best solution is to fix long paths on windows")

[13:48] <[Coke]> (or is there a way for windows installers to get this benefit themselves, like: installing from a git clone instead of the ecosystem)

[13:48] <[Coke]> ls

[13:48] <[Coke]> (ww)

[15:17] <ugexe> that already exists and it doesnt really help

[15:17] <ugexe> because the files still get installed to wherever rakudos path is

[15:18] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/710034fe3537826548d7f5c8983b3fb2db1e17de/.appveyor.yml#L10

[15:19] <ugexe> can't get a much shorter path than that, and that still only buys like ~20 characters of length

[15:22] <ugexe> but again that doesn't fix the issue that once zef passes this distribution to rakudo to be installed, that the precomp paths that rakudo generates can / likely-will-be too long

[15:23] <ugexe> hmm actually

[15:23] <[Coke]> ok, yah, not worth it.

[15:23] <[Coke]> ...oh?

[15:23] <ugexe> if you used the env shown in my link, + installed to a custom repository in e.g. C:\foo it might be sufficient for CI testing or local testing

[15:27] <[Coke]> (I already install in C:\raku; so making the custom install dir would save... a dozen or so characters? - at this point, every bit helps)(

[15:28] <ugexe> those characters help a lot more for installed modules since they are mostly fixed length parts

[15:29] <[Coke]> I was tempted to do something similar for some work I'm doing on a bunch of checked out repos, putting the root of that in C:\g\ or something.

[15:30] <ugexe> `export ZEF_CONFIG_TEMPDIR="C:\"`, `export ZEF_CONFIG_DEFAULTCUR="site#C:\tmpsite"`, and `export RAKULIB="$ZEF_CONFIG_DEFAULT_CUR,$RAKULIB`
