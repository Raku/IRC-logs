[10:53] * sjn just ran "zef search prove"

[10:53] <sjn> got: ===> Found 128 results

[10:54] <sjn> ...followed by a wall of text that was of no help whatsoever in finding out where "prove" exists

[10:56] <sjn> super frustrating :-(

[16:34] <tonyo> do you mean zef locate prove?

[17:03] <tonyo> `search` shows the auth info as REA

[17:10] <ugexe> there is no zef command for finding non-raku stuff like prove

[17:11] <ugexe> so i guess it isn't surprising that the result of zef search prove didn't help you find where it exists, since it is going to assume you are just searching for a module or description that contains the word 'prove'

[17:12] <ugexe> the raku runner is called prove6 fwiw

[17:56] <sjn> ugexe: yeah, I was assuming "search" looked for substrings

[17:56] <sjn> and expecting to find which distro included prove6 :)

[18:09] * sjn wonders if his expectations are unreasonable <_<

[18:09] <ugexe> to be fair, the "search" functionality hasnt really been iterated on past its initial implementation

[18:10] <ugexe> there isn't a lot of thought in what it searches or how

[18:10] * sjn doesn't even know what "shows the auth info as REA" means :-|

[18:11] <ugexe> i think they mean that search shows App::Prove6 is in the REA ecosystem

[18:11] * sjn assumed/hoped that search grepped through package names, descriptions and tags and returned any hits

[18:12] <ugexe> it searches through package names and descriptions yeah. it doesnt do anything with tags

[18:12] <sjn> eg. like "apt search <keyword>" does

[18:13] <sjn> returning one line per package+auth, not including versions/releases, would also be natural

[18:16] <lizmat> sjn maybe https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/CLI::Ecosystem is what you're looking for ?

[18:24] <tonyo> ideally it'd show only the latest version of that package unless it was a direct dist match or some flag was provided

[18:24] <tonyo> eg: zef search App::Prove6

[18:41] <ugexe> you'd probably use `zef info App::Prove6` if you already know the name

[18:42] <sjn> yeah. I was attempting to find that name using zef though

[18:43] <sjn> lizmat: maybe? thanks for the tip

[18:44] <sjn> tonyo: I think what you describe there ("only the latest version [â€¦]") really doesn't belong in the realm of the ideal, but rather "what's expected". :-D

[18:44] <tonyo> the rare time they can meet : )

[18:45] <sjn> assuming one subscribes to the "Principle of Least Astonishment" ;-)

[18:45] <sjn> when they meet, it's called "good enough" :-D

[18:47] <sjn> (and according to this metric, I live a deeply unfulfilled life <_< )

[18:47] <sjn> "Everything is wrong on the internet!"

[19:05] <tonyo> i thought you scandanavians were the happiest haha

[19:07] <sjn> Nah, that's the Danish. We Norwegians have bad weather to complain about
