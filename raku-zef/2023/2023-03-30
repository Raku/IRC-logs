[14:57] <tonyo> i don't think we need that much in here

[15:00] <lizmat> too late, already configured it  :-)

[15:00] <lizmat> seriously though, if you really don't want to publish zef / fez commits here ever, I can take it out again

[15:03] <tonyo> oh that's cool too

[15:03] <tonyo> danke

[15:05] <lizmat> in GH webhooks, add https://webhooks.liz.nl/?chan=%23raku-zef  with content-type application/json

[15:05] <lizmat> and you should be set
