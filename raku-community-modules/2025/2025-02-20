[09:29] <wayland76> Hi!  Where do I send PRs for community modules (like https://github.com/raku-community-modules/XML/pull/71 ) so that they get some attention?  

[09:38] <lizmat> either here or on #raku-dev

[09:38] <lizmat> :-)

[09:38] <wayland76> Do I need to do anything else, or have I already done enough?  

[09:40] <lizmat> in that particular case, enough...

[09:40] <lizmat> alternately, you could get a commit bit and membership of the zef raku-community-modules group so you can do updates yourself   :-)

[09:51] <wayland76> How do I do that?  Is there a document to read?  

[09:52] <wayland76> (happy if this commit goes ahead without me though)

[09:52] <lizmat> going afk for an hour or so, then will do the merge and update

[09:53] <lizmat> if you plan on doing some more on community modules, then being able to do it yourself would help you and me  :-)

[09:53] <lizmat> afk&

[09:55] <wayland76> I don't, but I wasn't planning to do this one either.  Nor was I planning to do the PRs I sent you for Hash::Agnostic a few months back.  I submit PRs when I find things broken for my particular use cases.  

[09:56] <wayland76> I'll probably be in bed in an hour, but I'm hoping to use the fixed version tomorrow morning :) .  

[10:07] <wayland76> (up to you to decide whether that's a useful frequency or not)

[11:08] <lizmat> works for me  :-)

[22:42] <wayland> Hi!  I've done another PR.  There's about a 70% chance I'll be implementing Associative on XML::Element in the next week or two.
