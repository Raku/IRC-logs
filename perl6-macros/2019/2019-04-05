[02:58] <masak> who knows, maybe yup will end up compiling to Perl 5 and be a good language for a first bootstrapping 007 compiler :P

[03:32] <masak> I read some more about Dylan macros in the spec. they are surprisingly similar to 007 macros, but the major difference is that they don't do anything like `is parsed` -- mostly they seem to do pattern matching on the token level

[04:09] * masak is very happy to be implementing NFA stuff

[04:09] <masak> will push a branch soon

[07:35] * masak recommends https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/blob/master/sources/dylan/macros.dylan as light reading

[07:59] <masak> define macro unless { unless (?test:expression) ?:body end } => { if (~?test) ?body else #f end } end macro unless;

[08:00] <masak> here are more examples from the manual: https://opendylan.org/books/drm/Rewrite_Rule_Examples#HEADING-86-3

[08:02] <masak> it reminds me that I ought also check out SweetJS

[09:56] <masak> ...making progress with the NFA stuff. can now do basic character classes. next up: \w, \d and friends

[09:57] <masak> I'm going to do a strictly ASCII take on those for this spike. don't tell TimToady ;)

[13:52] <masak> SmokeMachine: by the way, I searched for the phrase "entrei de gaiato!" today, to try to learn what it means. found a pretty good dictionary definition in pt-BR :)

[13:52] <masak> ...so I *think* I got the meaning. and I agree, not clear what the corresponding English idiom would be. :)

[13:54] <SmokeMachine> masak: Do you have the link? can I see it?

[13:56] <masak> https://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/entrar+de+gaiato/

[13:57] <SmokeMachine> masak: thanks...

[14:00] <SmokeMachine> living in the UK is making me figure out that Brazilian Portuguese has a lot of expressions about being "smarter" than the others or NOT being "smarter" than the others...

[14:02] <masak> interesting. wonder why.

[14:06] <SmokeMachine> masak: culture...

[14:09] <masak> my branch, https://github.com/masak/007/tree/masak/is-parsed-spike is progressing fairly well. happy to receive some code review. :)

[14:10] <masak> just about to implement negative character groups
