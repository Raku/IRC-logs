[18:08] <masak> have a look at this: https://github.com/masak/007/blob/82fc89d4e7f3eb68c061f85162c54f14a2c64124/nfa/mutable-grammar.007

[18:08] <masak> this craziness actually works

[18:09] <masak> (it's a data structure that can be used as a grammar to parse some text. the general idea is to be able to extend the data structure during the parse, thus allowing for mutable grammars, which 007 needs for `is parsed`)

[18:10] <masak> the data structure in that file is generated (by a Perl 6 script) from https://github.com/masak/007/blob/82fc89d4e7f3eb68c061f85162c54f14a2c64124/nfa/double-oh-one.grammar

[18:13] <masak> this is basically the ongoing work from https://github.com/masak/007/issues/485
