[09:29] <masak> hi

[09:30] <masak> quick status update: it's going slow with the mutable grammar spike, but I feel optimistic

[09:32] <masak> my mental TODO list looks something like this:

[09:32] <masak> (1) get a simple grammar with `<ident>` vs `my <ident>` working, and producing the right-ish Qtree

[09:33] <masak> (2) get 001 to work correctly

[09:33] <masak> (3) get grammar extensibility to work on 001

[09:33] <masak> (4) implement a full 007 grammar on top of the same engine

[09:33] <masak> (5) have it replace the current one

[09:34] <masak> (6) also provide full regex and grammar support from 007 userland

[10:01] <masak> we're actually doing fairly well for #481

[10:01] <masak> the parsing spike is the biggest thing -- if and when that succeeds, 007 will blossom out into a new era of `is parsed` (or `@parsed`) possibilities

[10:02] <masak> also almost finished with the object system refactor (only `Q::` left), which will unlock `class` and `enum` for us

[10:03] <masak> also almost finished putting the conscious-risks ecosystem in the test suite

[10:03] <masak> also eager to try out the examples cheating -- if we can time it so that the parsing spike lands soon thereafter, we don't have to cheat for so long

[10:04] <masak> so the Hit-the-pi√±ata goals actually seem reasonably achievable

[14:42] <masak> Ven````: dunno if you caught all that. the amount of your backticks keeps fluctuating ;)

[16:03] <Ven`````> masak: It's all very normal... Hips...

[16:03] *** Ven````` is now known as Ven``

[16:04] <Ven``> I actually did catch all of that! Good.

[16:05] <Ven``> I've been reading all the issues carefully, I don't have much to add (yet) though

[18:39] <masak> I can see how Cheating will be a big deal, morale-wise

[18:39] <masak> but it's also a bit fraught, since it'll just be surface. so we need the parsing spike.
