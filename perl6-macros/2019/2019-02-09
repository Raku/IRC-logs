[14:29] <masak> I'm on vacation, which is why there is some heightened activity around 007

[14:30] <masak> I want to take on the parser stuff, and the regex things, but it's a bit hard to know where to start

[14:30] <masak> even getting `is parsed` to do something trivial feels like quite a lot of work

[14:30] <masak> (but I would really really like to have it)

[14:39] <Ven``> I can attest to that feeling..:)

[14:55] <masak> meanwhile, I keep chipping away at smaller things

[14:55] <masak> regexes really are a big language. especially if one is aiming at getting it reasonably right with LTM and declarative prefixes.

[14:57] <Ven``> yeah, this is why I wanted to get a basic version working first, before implementing it correctly

[15:00] <masak> I'm still fine with that, but I don't even see a way to cheat majorly and get to `is parsed`

[15:00] <masak> the... impedance mismatch is just to huge

[15:00] <masak> too*

[15:03] <Ven``> I think we went over the different options several times, and last time we talked, you decided that 007 needed to be parsed in 007 to accomplish it

[15:04] <masak> yes, that's what I still believe. it's the right way, it's just a big step to take.
