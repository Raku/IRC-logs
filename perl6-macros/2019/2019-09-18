[13:52] <masak> sooo... URL should be https://geth.svc.tyil.net/?chan=%23perl6-macros  ?

[13:55] <tyil> yes

[14:00] <masak> "| use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes" -- the instructions made sense, except for this bit

[14:00] <masak> ...done.

[14:01] <masak> but we lost Geth, it seems

[14:10] <tyil> we have Geth_ 

[14:34] <tyil> when a new Geth comes up and the old Geth is still connected, it will becomes Geth_

[14:35] <tyil> I should make an IRC::Client plugin to check if the desired nick is available and hop to that 

[14:35] <tyil> someday...
