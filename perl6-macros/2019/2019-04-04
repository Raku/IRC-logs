[15:13] <masak> lucasb: wow, hadn't seen yup before. cool!

[15:14] <masak> I think I'm most curious about what you're going to do with macros when compiling to p5

[15:21] <masak> lucasb: feel free to give credit if you want, but also feel free to not.

[15:22] <masak> lucasb: in a way, I think you are bound by the Artistic License 2.0 in all this, but it says you can modify/distribute, so we're good there

[15:22] <masak> and you did rename the thing, so...

[15:23] <masak> I smiled at the rename back to "sub" and "grep" :) neither of those naming decisions came easy -- I prefer to stick close to Perl tradition.

[15:25] <masak> we should really do a more concerted effort with backends. a p5 backend is a great idea.

[15:33] * masak tinkers around with https://github.com/masak/007/issues/485

[15:45] <masak> oh! Ven: I started reading in earnest about Dylan.

[15:45] <masak> haven't even got to the macros part, and I already find it a very charming little language.

[21:02] <lucasb> feel free to do whatever you want

[21:04] <SmokeMachine> entrei de gaiato! :) (sorry... I think there is no way to say that in English...)

[21:04] <lucasb> haha, tbm não sei, mas deve ter uma expressão

[21:17] <AlexDaniel`> not sure what I'm supposed to do with that privilege :)
