[06:52] <masak> going to merge #545 later today

[07:04] *** Xliff joined
[09:55] <masak> 007 has now been renamed "Alma" \o/

[10:17] <Xliff> \o/

[10:18] <Xliff> Has any of Alma made it into Perl6, yet?

[10:41] <masak> well, Rakudo has an early/primitive form of macro/quasi

[10:41] <masak> it's just that it's _correctly_ implemented in Alma, with hygiene, and that bit needs to be carried over now

[10:43] <Xliff> Ah. I take it none of that is documented, yes?

[13:03] <masak> you mean on the Perl 6 side? no, it's not.

[13:03] <masak> it would be great if it were, but it also takes real time and effort to do so :)

[13:20] *** lucasb joined
[13:27] <lucasb> hey, welcome Alma! congrats :)

[13:27] <lucasb> It means "soul" in my language

[13:33] <lucasb> (or is it a reference to... Amelia? :)

[23:09] *** lucasb left
