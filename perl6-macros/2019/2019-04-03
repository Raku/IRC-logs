[12:22] <lucasb> hehe, I was just playing with it

[12:22] <lucasb> never touched it again, but maybe I'll :)

[12:26] <lucasb> with regard https://github.com/lucasbuchala/yup/blob/master/META6.json#L5-L6 I just imagined masak wouldn't like to have his name associated with my crap idea :)

[12:28] <lucasb> in the 'description' field, I would like to change it to "Yet another small experimental language (Based on Carl Masak's 007)" or something like that, to give him credit, if he's ok with it. :)

[12:30] <lucasb> anyway, I wanted a language that would compile to Perl 5

[12:38] <lucasb> I forked before https://github.com/masak/007/pull/451 otherwise I guess I wouldn't feel the need to

[12:51] <Ven```> .oO( Another Backend on the Wall )

[12:52] * Ven``` would certainly use a more complete (... and faster) 007 :P
