[12:51] <lucasb> hey o/

[12:51] <lucasb> how come you didn't make a IRC evalbot for 007 yet? :D

[13:12] <SmokeMachine> (007 evalbot)++

[13:26] <masak> that's a really good question

[13:26] <masak> shouldn't be that hard, I think

[13:27] <masak> and can reasonably be hosted on hack.p6c.org or something

[13:29] <masak> is someone aware of any prior art? is camelia online somewhere in a git repo?

[13:30] <masak> ah, here: https://github.com/perl6/evalbot
