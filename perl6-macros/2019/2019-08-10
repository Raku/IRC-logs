[20:12] <masak> ok, I can see from the get-go that this relates to @succinct

[20:13] <masak> oh, this is where he invents defmacro/g! -- yeah, I remember this part

[20:15] <masak> hm, no, it isn't. he invented it earlier but uses it here as a component for defmacro!

[20:17] <masak> anyway, I'm not sure we can both follow this closely and have lvalues work
