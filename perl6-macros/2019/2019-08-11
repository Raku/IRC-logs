[10:24] <masak> I just had a realization about Location

[10:27] <masak> if we're serious about "they don't survive to runtime" then their function is much simplified; it becomes a must-collapse intermediate form. specifically, locations need no actual runtime semantics, except perhaps conceptually

[10:29] <masak> that is, they become a "just barely first-class setf mechanism" - a volatile way to express what value-centered expressions can't

[10:30] <masak> in effect, no Location object ever needs to be actually created

[10:45] <masak> the analogy is pretty strong with unquotes, which are also a "preternatural escape mechanism" in order to achieve something otherwise hard or impossible
