[09:05] <Ven``> Yes, that's pretty good :-). I'm happy to see that moving.

[09:07] <Ven``> WRT containers/locations (... I thought I replied to that but apparently not), I did compare them because they allow similar things, but at different levels.

[09:08] <Ven``> I know Perl(6) really likes the "Invented Here" thing - as opposed to most programming languages - but I still dislike some "new mistakes" Perl 6 made :-).

[09:08] <Ven``>  

[09:08] <SmokeMachine> Ven``: like what? (just curious...)

[09:19] <Ven``> I dislike sigils. I dislike flattening. so I also dislike the one-or-single-item-list rule. I'd sacrifice `%h<k>` in a heartbeat to be able to reason about my code. Also, though minor, think dynamic variables are misdesigned (I much prefer CL/clojure's model).

[09:19] <Ven``> There are a few other minor annoyances I have but it's all mostly about containers and flattening.

[09:24] <masak> aye

[13:25] <Ven```> Here's what I just wrote in a test that checks a generated AST: `is-deeply slurp($expected-file), from-json(to-json(serialize(%parsed-ast)));

[13:25] <Ven```> :-(
