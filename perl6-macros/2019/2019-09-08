[19:52] <masak> it feels like a lot of the work going forward is in (or around) documentation

[19:52] <masak> the documentation is in the works, as tracked by https://github.com/masak/alma/issues/385

[19:52] <masak> I will try again to finish it up

[19:55] <masak> even the era of Cheating is blocking on #385, so...

[19:55] <masak> my two priorities in the coming week should be the language guide and the OO refactor

[19:56] <masak> (on a slightly more private note; I'm moving house, and will be in-between homes tomorrow. slightly distracted.)

[19:59] <Xliff> \o

[19:59] <Xliff> masak: Do you have a pointer for the current macro support in rakudo?

[21:56] <Xliff> Can current macros be exported?
