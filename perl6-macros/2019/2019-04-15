[18:39] <masak> I'm encouraged at how close I was to getting this to work: https://github.com/masak/007/blob/masak/send-more-money/examples/send-more-money/stage-3.007.wip

[18:39] <masak> feels like with a concerted effort, I'd get it all the way

[18:41] <masak> inherent in that script is an insight I hadn't grokked all the way yet: macros can take their arguments and generate _any_ code from them

[18:43] <masak> (in that sense, context macros are "unnecessary", in the sense that ordinary macros can mess around quite a lot with their contents. the one thing contextual macros contribute is that the outer context doesn't have to be a macro call.)
