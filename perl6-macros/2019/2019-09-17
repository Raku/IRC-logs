[13:30] <lucasb> AlexDaniel` can you give us a hand? :D

[13:31] <lucasb> it isn't very clear what I need to edit in https://github.com/perl6/geth 

[13:32] *** AlexDaniel joined
[13:32] <AlexDaniel> well, first we need to make it join this channel

[13:33] <lucasb> who runs the bot? tyil?

[13:33] <AlexDaniel> which you can do like this: https://github.com/perl6/geth/commit/f15f41008e71eb37ba13830833f9b1e548d2a8f4

[13:33] <AlexDaniel> then you add a webhook like this:

[13:33] <AlexDaniel> “To add repo, add an 'application/json' webhook on GitHub pointing it to http://hack.p6c.org:8888/?chan=#perl6 and choose 'Send me everything' for events to send | use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes”

[13:34] <AlexDaniel> ok the | ver part is irrelevant

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: and yeah, then you ask tyil to `git pull` and restart the bot

[13:39] <lucasb> AlexDaniel: thank you! (afk now, I'll return to this task later :)

[15:03] <lucasb> idk if it'll work, but the channel was added in https://github.com/perl6/geth/commit/f0ddc2df22eee14f01e6e798edc0fb39f6ef13f5

[20:48] <tyil> lucasb: I'm an idiot, I use a configmap for geth in my k8s cluster, not the config.json ;~;

[20:48] <tyil> it's here now, sorry for the long wait

[21:08] <lucasb> tyil: thank you very much!

[21:08] <lucasb> Geth: helloo

[21:09] <lucasb> Geth: help

[21:09] <Geth> lucasb, Source at https://github.com/perl6/geth To add repo, add an 'application/json' webhook on GitHub pointing it to https://svc.tyil.net/?chan=%23perl6 and choose 'Send me everything' for events to send | use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes

[21:09] <tyil> huh

[21:09] <tyil> that URL needs updating

[21:09] <tyil> thanks for pointing that one out :p

[21:09] <lucasb> ok, I think next step is... masak setting webhook in the repo :)

[21:10] <tyil> the correct URL is https://geth.svc.tyil.net/

[21:10] <tyil> I dont have my signing key here, so I'll make a PR to update it later, and build a new docker image right away
