[07:17] <masak> heads-up: I took down the 007-runtime repository (as it was in an organization I won't have access to soon)

[07:18] <masak> those 11 commits are now in a 007 branch called `refurbished-runtime` instead

[07:18] <masak> I do want to work on that bit (especially the web visualizer, which I think will be very central) but need to finish the object system refactor first

[07:18] <masak> (not much left now)

[19:45] <Ven``> masak: if you're available, I'd like to discuss s'more what we need for the basic `is succinct` stuff (well hopefully as a macro itself) and work through it in the upcoming days&weeks (well; when we both have time)

[19:47] <Ven``> 1) name introductions (or rebinding thereof) 2) defining "Q API Boundaries" 3) what else is needed towards walk()

[19:47] <Ven``> (I was quite surprised to see that we started talking about `walk` - well, its infancy - 4.5 years ago already.)

[19:49] <Ven``> I understand why the renaming to Alma and the object system refactor are important, but I'm still a bit in "end-of-conference rush" mode and I'd like to use it
