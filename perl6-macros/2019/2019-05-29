[10:14] <masak> I've started in on https://github.com/masak/007/blob/masak/is-parsed-spike/nfa/mutable-grammar.007 -- pretty happy with where that's going so far

[10:15] <masak> again, the immediate goal is to (a) parse 001, and (b) be able to mess around with adding and removing rules during the parse

[10:15] <masak> I'm thinking about code-generating the contents of the `grammar` data structure, so that I can write it using Perl 6-like grammar syntax, and not have to write that data format

[10:16] <masak> there's something slightly ironic about using code generation as part of a language effort that aims to eliminate much of that kind of code generation
