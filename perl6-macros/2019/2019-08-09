[10:00] <SmokeMachine> Will it be possible some day to override && and || with a macro?

[11:21] <masak> SmokeMachine: it is. https://github.com/masak/007/issues/277

[11:22] <masak> SmokeMachine: is that question about 007/Alma or about Perl 6?

[11:23] <SmokeMachine> masak: perl6... 007/Alma && and || are macros, right?

[11:23] <masak> in 007, it should be possible already (otherwise, please file a bug issue)

[11:23] <SmokeMachine> masak: what about perl6?

[11:24] <masak> in Perl 6, I'm hopeful we can get it to be shadowable one day

[11:24] <masak> as of today, it's too hardcoded

[11:25] <masak> the same goes for most or all "macroish" mechanisms in today's Perl 6, since they are not actually implemented on top of macros

[11:33] <masak> Ven``: I pushed up https://github.com/masak/007/compare/masak/succinct

[11:35] <Ven``> nice :)

[11:36] <Ven``> I'm not attending any talk atm (none of them are about P6 I think) so maybe I'll take a look at it again

[11:45] <SmokeMachine> I know that it's not related to macros, but it's related to the issue I was trying to fix using macros... so... maybe its a better solution: https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/175

[11:52] <masak> Ven``: wow. check out the TravisCI failure on the branch. I thought it was spurious, but it's *really* good

[11:52] <masak> past me was smarter than I am

[11:52] <masak> Ven``: where you at? I can come to you

[11:53] <Ven``> masak: I'm near @%, in the small seated area

[11:53] <Ven``> are you at $?

[11:53] <Ven``> > not ok 8 - method statement:func-or-macro (line 229) has a self.finishblock for each Q::Block

[11:55] <masak> I'm inside $ right now. talk almost over

[11:55] <masak> that's the failure, yes

[11:55] <masak> (we need to enter the block)

[11:56] <masak> I bet there's a test we could write which exposes the fact that we don't

[11:56] <Ven``> ok, I'll move to $ then

[11:57] <masak> SmokeMachine: that does sound like a macro problem, yes

[11:57] <masak> I think I will want to catch jjmerelo in $ up next

[14:20] <Ven``> aah, here it is: https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap3.html#sec_6

[14:21] <Ven``> it's actually not the same because you mark the once-only part with `o!X`
