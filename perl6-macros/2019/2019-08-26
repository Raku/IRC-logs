[07:52] <masak> lucasb: Portuguese? anyway, that meaning was known to me, thanks to FCO

[07:52] <Ven``> Portguese and/or Spanish

[07:52] <masak> oh, even Spanish

[07:53] <masak> of course, the "real" etymology is "ALgoloid with MAcros" ;)

[07:55] <Ven``> even in Italian, it seems.

[08:01] <masak> Ven``: I know I'll be distracted for a while more, but I do want to capitalize on the post-conf feeling of getting somewhere with walk

[08:01] <masak> Ven``: what's the smallest possible increment on `master` that makes sense, you think?

[08:02] <masak> defining a `walk` built-in at all, I guess

[08:02] <masak> having it do _something_, match on something

[08:16] <Ven``> probably a very simple `walk(node, [Q.Foo, fn()])`? No attributes, not trying to be fancy by finding parents, etc

[08:26] <Ven``> (er, I meant that passing Q would find any node underneath)

[08:33] <masak> aye

[08:33] <masak> PRs welcome, unless I get to it first

[08:34] <masak> I think it'd be simpler, if not as theoretically satisfying, to implement `walk` in Perl 6

[08:34] <masak> that built-in would definitely be our most complex built-in

[08:56] <Ven``> well, we already have a very similar one ;-)

[08:56] <Ven``> not sure we can abstract it away

[09:07] <Ven``> (fwiw I'm talking about https://github.com/masak/alma/blob/c5344f54c32ae8c0bfcd0f6fd98f9fe85b044c08/lib/Alma/Q.pm6#L728-L794 )

[09:27] <Ven``> also, I think it'd be more satisfying to implement in Alma, no?

[09:27] <Ven``> Standing on the shoulder of can of worms, etc.

[11:13] <masak> more satisfying, yes

[11:13] <masak> conducive to a release-early frame of mind, not sure

[11:14] <masak> maybe I'm overly paranoid; maybe it's just as easy to do in Alma :)

[11:17] <masak> re the `&interpolate` routine you linked to -- I wish that was the only implementation of `walk` "we" have in the source code. I'm aware of two more :P

[11:17] <masak> and yes, I think the case is pretty strong to unify those under one code path. thanks for making me aware of that.

[11:18] <masak> care to file an issue about that? ;)

[11:18] <masak> (the other two are `&handle` for hardening non-parsed Qs, and `&interpolate` in .detach

[11:18] <masak> )

[11:20] <masak> ...on the bright side, it's good that this vaporware has three interested consumers already :P

[13:23] <Ven``> masak: you probably want to change the channel topic too :)

[13:24] *** masak changes topic to: Perl 6 macros -- about https://github.com/masak/alma/ and how macros fit into Perl 6 -- irclog: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6-macros

[13:31] <Ven``> masak: not sure where is &handle you mentioned earlier today.
