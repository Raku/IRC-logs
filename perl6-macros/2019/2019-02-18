[15:12] <masak> I feel that action classes are weird. I wouldn't be sad if they turned out not to be necessary for what we want to do with parsing in 007

[15:12] <masak> there's already a little bit of a conflict, between macro bodies and action methods.

[15:12] <masak> but I feel that action classes are odd for other reasons, too.

[15:13] <masak> they offer a separation of concerns from the grammar. but why; for whose benefit? I've _never_ needed two different action classes for one grammar.

[15:15] <masak> it's possible both to forget to add the action class altogether, and to forget to declare (or rename) an action method corresponding to a grammar rule
