[11:08] <masak> will do :)

[11:09] * masak prefers to have No Known Bugs in the language... but not at the expense of refusing to reproduce them

[12:52] *** Ven_de_Thiel joined
[12:52] <Ven_de_Thiel> .oO( I removed the runner script for my language, and since then, it has received exactly 0 bug reports )

[14:40] <masak> Ven_de_Thiel: converting to variables works: https://github.com/masak/alma/commit/21556b886f03ab8960477131df7f6523ace57fb7?w=1

[14:40] <masak> (at a guess, maybe you forgot to make it `BEGIN my`?)

[14:40] <Ven_de_Thiel> yay! I guess it was because that was prior to my work on findAllAttributes() :)

[14:41] <Ven_de_Thiel> oh, maybe I did, since it was used by subs... but of course the subs are invoked by a macro :)

[14:42] <masak> right

[14:42] <masak> the timing is what matters

[14:43] <masak> I will keep massaging that code; it's fun

[14:47] <Ven_de_Thiel> ...I'm glad :-)

[14:50] <Ven_de_Thiel> 3 things I was gonna do 1) API for inheritList 2) API for attrList 3) `rootType.copyWithAttributes(root, ...);`

[15:00] <masak> the API things I would be much happier doing after the object system refactor

[15:01] <masak> but I guess we can shove them in before

[15:01] <masak> Qtypes are long overdue for some API methods

[15:39] <Ven_de_Thiel> yay :)

[15:43] <masak> hm, that branch triggers a MoarVM bug: https://travis-ci.org/masak/alma/builds/585625456

[15:43] <masak> can't reproduce it locally, though

[15:47] <Ven_de_Thiel> that's a lot of bytes

[15:48] <Ven_de_Thiel> can you re-run the tests? I want to know if it's flapping

[15:50] <masak> ok

[15:51] <masak> I dislike the term "flapping". it makes light of essentially a real problem: an unreliable test.

[15:52] <masak> when tests are unreliable, they decrease confidence and ultimately velocity/value

[15:52] <masak> note though that the branch has been failing for a few commits already -- that's also data, I guess

[15:55] <Ven_de_Thiel> I'm just cargo-culting the term

[16:01] <masak> yeah, I know. not your fault :) and I'm just tilting at another windmill

[16:02] <masak> well, it failed again. fails fairly reliably for a "flapper"

[16:02] * masak .oO( reliably unreliable )

[16:08] <Ven_de_Thiel> hahaha

[16:11] <masak> logic puzzles like "if you try to fail, and succeed, what have you really done?" kinda rub me the wrong way. someone can't keep track of their semantic levels, that's all. nothing to write home about

[16:13] <Ven_de_Thiel> .oO( we need more parentheses. Also lisp macro phases )

[17:20] <masak> re "# XXX maybe we need `append` in Alma?" -- we could go the Perl 6 and JavaScript route and make .push variadic

[17:21] <masak> I'm just a little bit concerned that it'd be one of those abstractions that aren't entirely free

[17:24] <masak> interestingly, what you're really using `append` for here is a `gather`... :)

[17:30] <masak> https://github.com/masak/alma/commit/7f3d9c76834894a9fb2b768218d5736ffd41350f

[17:30] <masak> :)

[18:24] <lucasb> Wouldn't be nice to have Geth announce Alma commits here? :)
