[00:04] <lucasb> this channel exists! I forgot. I was trying #007, and other variations

[00:05] <lucasb> hmm, 007 install the utilities "lint" and "repl" in the system

[00:07] <lucasb> they are very generic names. would it be possible to put a "7" or "007" in the names somewhere? :)

[00:07] <lucasb> sorry to ask this

[00:08] <lucasb> It's because my PATH env var is shared for everything. so these very generic names ended up in the environment

[00:10] <lucasb> I'm just suggesting some disambiguation, like 7repl, 7lint, repl7, lint7, or maybe even repl.007 and lint.007

[00:11] <lucasb> well, "007 --repl", "007 --lint"

[09:12] <masak> lucasb: agreed

[09:15] <masak> done.

[12:45] *** lucasb joined
[12:46] <lucasb> masak: thanks!

[13:00] <masak> thank *you* -- this had not occurred to me at all :)

[13:00] <masak> while I have you on the line, and since you've read the ROADMAP.md; what would you like to see in 007 soon?

[13:01] <masak> (the default assumption/null hypothesis being the order in the short-term priorities)

[13:03] <lucasb> idk, didn't play with it yet, just wrote a hello world :)

[13:04] <masak> did you check out the new documentation? http://masak.github.io/007/

[13:04] <masak> (still writing on the macros part. it's tough going but really useful.)

[13:04] <lucasb> I still have to wrap my head around all the concepts. your issue queue sure looks like a treasure trove of information!

[13:04] <masak> in a "need to mine for it" sense, yes

[13:05] <lucasb> for example, I like how you use it as an archive, in https://github.com/masak/007/issues/426

[13:05] <lucasb> hehe, Self-closing issue. keep going!

[13:06] <masak> well, that one (unexpectedly) led on to #430, which is still making me a little giddy with anticipation

[13:07] <lucasb> just a quick design question

[13:07] <lucasb> the syntax is very clean, no sigils, that's nice

[13:07] <lucasb> but there's still the ";" :) have you considered automatic semicolon insertion?

[13:08] <lucasb> so in code I could drop the semicolon from the end of the line *iff* it seems that it's a "end of statement"

[13:09] <lucasb> sure, the rules need to be clear when this happen

[13:10] <masak> the closest thing I've considered is having a Python "skin" to 007

[13:10] <masak> changing not just the semicolons but also the block syntax

[13:11] <masak> I don't believe I have an issue for that

[13:11] <lucasb> ah, right.

[13:11] <lucasb> CoffeeScript, do you like too?

[13:11] <masak> ASI (as JavaScript) does it seems a bit like a cure worse than its disease

[13:11] <masak> argh, ')' fail :)

[13:11] <masak> ASI (as JavaScript does it) seems a bit like a cure worse than its disease

[13:12] <masak> I liked what CoffeeScript was doing conceptually (being one of the first compile-to-JS languages), but I never particularly liked/used CoffeeScript :)

[13:12] <lucasb> ah, yes, in JS I put semicolons always

[13:13] <lucasb> ah ok, just mentioned it because of indented syntax like python, but dropped the colon ":" from the statements

[13:16] <masak> mm. I'd probably keep the colons, trying to stick close to Python syntax
