[13:22] <SmokeMachine> I’d like to understand how will `is parsed` work. How will it set what should be the macro’s parameters. I think I already had asked that, but if I  had, I’ve forgotten the answer...

[21:35] <masak> SmokeMachine: last time that was up for discussion on this channel, I conceded to Ven++'s point that there should be less automatic binding/unpacking and magic involved

[21:36] <masak> SmokeMachine: so the current unofficial official answer is "if you're an `is parsed` macro, you get all the usual things to the left of you, plus a `match` parameter with what you parsed"

[21:37] <masak> so, concretely, an `is parsed` prefix op gets only (match); an `is parsed` infix op gets (lhs, match); an `is parsed` postfix op gets (term, match)

[21:38] <masak> (Ven said "but that makes infix and postfix identical!" -- well yes, except that they also leave the parser in different "expect" states -- infix:term::postfix:operator)
