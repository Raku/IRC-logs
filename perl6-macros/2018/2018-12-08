[18:15] <masak> in other news, I have a branch masak/decorators going, and I'm very encouraged by how it's going

[18:16] <masak> going from traits to decorators seems like a step away from Perl 6, but I really like how it fits into the rest of the language

[18:16] <masak> decorators can be macros! (essentially, traits in Perl 6 are that already, and have been used in macro-like ways ever since they appeared)
