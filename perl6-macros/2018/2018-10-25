[12:46] <masak> Ven`: re "the way <infix> is captured is wrong", I completely agree. that bit's still too handwavey

[12:46] <masak> it's a little bit related to 007 not having and not wanting action methods

[12:48] <masak> how about if all @parsed macros got an extra positional argument `match` or something, and then `my op = match["infix"].ast;` or whatever? basically taken directly from Perl 6's match objects

[12:50] <Ven`> that can work yeah , but should it be an *extra* argument? what other arguments are there?

[13:23] <masak> it'd have as arguments the things that were inevitably already parsed; an infix would have the lhs, and a postfix would have its term

[13:30] <Ven`> ah, right.

[13:30] <Ven`> arguably then, the rhs should also be an argument for the infix.

[13:33] <Ven`> (otherwise there's no difference between a postfix and an infix)
