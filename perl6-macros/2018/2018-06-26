[12:42] <masak> Ven`: I was thinking about what you said, about not making the Perl 6 mistake of adding containers to the language

[12:43] <masak> I'm not sure whether Location qualifies or not; in a way, Locations exist (in lexpads and arrays/dicts) whether we expose them or not

[12:44] <Ven`> I don't think they do. I mulled over it for a bit, but I think the fact that locations only exist as lvalues is fine.

[12:45] <Ven`> There is no binding or such. if I do %hash<invalid key>.elems in Perl 6, I get 1. This is the kind of things I'd rather avoid.

[12:46] <masak> right

[12:46] <Ven`> A location is just a... dynamic lvalue.

[12:46] <Ven`> .oO( I'm proud to say we have reinvented pointers )

[12:46] <masak> yes, part of Location is that "looking up an rvalue factors into looking up an lvalue followed by getting its value"

[12:47] <masak> in other words, the lookup part needs to behave *exactly* the same as it normally does

[12:47] <masak> and 007 gets dict key strictness from its second parent, Python :)

[12:48] <Ven`> Strictness is fine. `...elems` returning 0 is fine. `...elems` returning 1 is something I consider a "bug".

[12:48] <Ven`> I consider how it happens, I know that :v solves the issue, but... still.

[12:48] <masak> mhm

[12:49] <Ven`> That pretty much sums up my position... I've started using Perl 6 some 4 years ago, and the only thing I've never been able to like are sigils/containers and flattening. I'm still getting surprised sometimes :P.

[12:49] <masak> unrelatedly, https://github.com/masak/007/issues/209#issuecomment-399915859 has been bugging me lately

[12:50] <masak> I didn't realize Type objects would have to be that "late"

[12:50] <masak> I naively assumed they'd be 1-per-textual-site

[12:51] * Ven` remembers an old discussion on the topic of `method a { my $bool; method b { ... } };` were they were very adament

[12:51] <masak> hehe

[12:52] <masak> fwiw, I don't plan to re-do that one in 007; methods will only be allowed directly in the class block

[12:52] <Ven`> Yay!

[12:52] <masak> (but I also think that Perl 6 has it right the way it does, given its other design choices)

[12:53] <masak> also, keep in mind that at one point (during the Parrot days), the problem with that code was that it *crashed* when calling .b because lookups from it ended up literally nowhere

[12:53] <masak> Parrot was ungood in that way

[12:54] <masak> the 007 dictum (and Perl 6's too, I believe) is "everything gets at least a static frame"

[12:55] <Ven`> That's... interesting.

[12:56] <masak> which part? that Parrot crashed, or that 007/p6 have that dictum?

[12:56] <Ven`> No, that parrot bit.

[12:56] <Ven`> I'd expect an equivalent to our (I believe) VMNull

[12:57] <masak> oh, it was that

[12:57] <masak> Null PMC Exception or whatever

[12:57] <masak> but I count that as a crash, because it was outside of the domain of Rakudo

[12:57] <Ven`> Oh, OK!

[12:58] <masak> "PMC", by the way, stood for "Parrot Magic Cookie", for reasons that I guess were funny at one point

[12:58] <Ven`> "You Think It's Cute Now" syndrom or something

[12:59] <masak> *Today, yes :)

[12:59] <Ven`> The only thing I recall about PMC/PIR is FROGGS++ demonstrating some v5 stuff in Salzburg and just... typing PIR code by hand to feed the VM.

[12:59] <masak> http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/1.0.0/html/docs/vtables.pod.html claims it stands for "PolyMorphic Container", but I think that's a retronym

[13:00] <masak> the funny thing about typing PIR code by hand is that PIR (an Intermediate Language) grew way too big for its clothes, including being written by hand a lot

[13:01] <masak> at some point large parts of the Rakudo grammar engine (PGE) was written in PIR

[13:01] <masak> I remember porting it to Perl 6

[13:19] <Ven`> Sounds like a... Fun project, for sure.

[13:20] <Ven`> Mmh, I guess it's been a while since Parrot last had a release.

[13:20] <Ven`> I know rurban worked a bit on potion after that, and I think he's busy with cperl now...

[13:22] * Ven` looks sadly at the GSoC 2014

[13:59] <Ven`> F??tbol is making the network... unstable to say the least.

[13:59] <Ven`> I'm not sure too sure about packages vs classes..yet.

[14:00] <masak> me neither

[14:01] <masak> I discussed it with a colleague today, who agreed it's cleaner to have just one separator instead of two, if one will do

[14:01] <masak> right now that's about the extent I'm certain about, that one is cleaner
