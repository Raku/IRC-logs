[17:27] <Ven``> masak: yeah, quite a bit (wrt hackett)

[17:27] <Ven``> I still follow the repo

[17:27] <Ven``> I *think* I mentioned hackett a few times, but what is history nowadays

[17:27] *** Ven`` left
[21:31] <masak> I've read through the Guide and the Reference now

[21:32] <masak> seems a very solid hybrid of Haskell and Lisp

[21:32] <masak> I was mildly disappointed to not find macros exposed in Hackett itself -- but I might've missed something

[21:32] <masak> yet to read the paper(s) behind it
