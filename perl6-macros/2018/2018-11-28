[12:33] <lucasb> In https://github.com/masak/007/blob/master/lib/_007/Backend/JavaScript.pm6#L32-L70

[12:34] <lucasb> it seems those emit-stmt multis are inside the emit method... after the return statement

[12:35] <lucasb> I can drop one level of indentation and take them out of the emit method, if it makes sense

[14:04] <lucasb> ha! https://github.com/masak/007/blob/master/t/code-style/taboo-words.t#L5-L14

[14:05] <lucasb> I added: token Ident { <.ident> [ '-' <.ident> ]* }

[14:05] <lucasb> token identifier { <.Ident> ... }

[14:06] <lucasb> I know having hyphenated identifiers in a sigil-less language is complicated (can't "x-y" to subtract)

[14:14] <SmokeMachine> lucasb: you can require space...

[14:30] <lucasb> yeah, even P6 has this problem with "\foo" vars

[14:32] <lucasb> having to write spaced like "x - y" is the price one has to pay to have foo-bar-baz identifiers. seems a good tradeoff :-)
