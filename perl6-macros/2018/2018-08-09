[08:03] <Ven`> so, I've tried to write some Haxe for a bit.

[08:04] <Ven`> I was interested in the to-lua part, but one of the things you use often in lua are var args, which aren't part of Haxe

[08:04] <Ven`> thankfully, Haxe has... macros! so I wrote a small wrapper. https://github.com/vendethiel/haxewow/blob/master/Test.hx

[08:05] <Ven`> This is prety much a (very stupid) signature binder

[08:07] <masak> nice!

[08:08] <masak> by the way, what's your take on Haxe? is it a good language?

[08:48] <Ven`> masak: the documentation is awful

[08:48] <Ven`> I'm not too surprised, but still...

[08:48] <Ven`> Especially considering I ran right into macros (this was my first Haxe program), which tend to have even less users than the rest...

[08:48] <Ven`> but at the end I was looking at the sources on github.

[08:49] <masak> ok :)

[08:49] <Ven`> it also happened when I was doing some Crystal, but Crystal is only 4 years old. Haxe is 13 years old...

[08:50] <masak> yeah

[08:51] <Ven`> It's very much a community issue. They never really gained traction. My memory from 2005 is a bit fuzzy, but I seem to remember it was only for ActionScript back then, and the codebase was proprietary

[08:51] <Ven`> that probably hindered them a lot.

[08:51] <masak> right

[08:51] <masak> speaking of documentation

[08:51] <masak> dunno if you've seen it, but I'm currently writing https://gist.github.com/masak/010ba2ab93a5632c1667155339ffd05b

[08:52] <Ven`> Anyway, the language itself is fairly nice. A good deal of static typing, fairly advanced features, ...

[08:52] <masak> it's going fairly well

[08:52] <masak> soon ready to tackle the middle third of the documentation, which is all about macros

[08:52] <Ven`> there are a few things it doesn't offer in itself, but allow the FFI'd-to language to do, like overloading functions.

[08:52] <masak> as usual when I write documentation, it feeds back greatly into 007 itself

[08:54] <Ven`> wow, where is that @get/@set syntax coming from

[08:54] <Ven`> I have no recollection of it

[08:54] <Ven`> (I mean of discussing it in the issues)

[08:54] <masak> it's conjectural at this point

[08:54] <masak> and might not survive

[08:55] <masak> it's not 100% truthful, as @get mostly means "public"/"accessible from the outside"

[08:56] <masak> but aside from that, I like the class declaration syntax a lot, as used in the documentation

[08:56] <masak> it's very non-opinionated

[09:06] <Ven`> is that even possible? :P

[09:09] <masak> it's one of those never-quite-achieved goals to strive towards, I guess

[09:09] <masak> akin to Python's "there should be one obvious way"

[11:20] <masak> thinking of calling them @settable @property instead of @set @get
