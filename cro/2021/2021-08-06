[14:42] <sena_kun> Xliff, you need to use latest Cro::HTTP

[14:43] <sena_kun> Xliff, luckily for you we are doing a release today. :)

[14:43] <Xliff> My repo of cro-http doesn't see an

[14:44] <Xliff> Ha! Had to pull from upstream.

[14:45] <Xliff> [Cro::HTTP] 'Cro::Iri::HTTP::Actions' cannot inherit from 'Cro::Iri::GenericActions' because it is unknown.

[14:46] <sena_kun> And there you want a Cro::Core update...

[14:46] <sena_kun> that's why releases are nice I guess

[14:46] <Xliff> Heheh!

[16:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm glad the interval between the last release and this one was rather shorter then had been the case last time around :)

[18:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> Not a page but a more lasting link than just the release page without it

[18:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: Yes
