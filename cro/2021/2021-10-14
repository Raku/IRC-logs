[08:40] <Xliff_> Good morning, Cro.

[12:04] <lizmat> github complains about this for one of my modules: /Users/runner/hostedtoolcache/rakudo/2021.09-01/x86_64/bin/rakudo is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way

[12:04] <lizmat> on MacOS...  any idea what that is about?

[12:05] <lizmat> tests on Linux and windows are fine

[12:06] <lizmat> https://github.com/lizmat/App-IRC-Log/runs/3894190703?check_suite_focus=true   # for reference

[12:06] <lizmat> the actual test is just loading the module, nothing else

[13:23] <lizmat> ok, I guess the container used in CI needs to be fixed somehow ?

[13:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, there was also a fix to the module, maybe the container has an older version?

[13:43] <lizmat> possibly, I've pinged skaji as he probably knows who to contact about that / is responsible for the container used

[19:58] <Xliff_> OK, so I have a template in memory that I want to compile and be used in place of it's representation on disk. What's the best way to make Cro::WebApp::Template do that?

[21:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> Xliff_: See the declarator docs in the template repository implementation; you can subclass it and then set your subclass as the repository to use.
