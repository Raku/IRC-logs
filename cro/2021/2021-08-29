[20:26] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: Is there a reason not to merge vendethiel's https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/pull/32 ?

[22:47] *** Altai-man left
[22:47] *** Altai-man joined
[23:22] <japhb> This looks like a typo to me: https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/blob/master/lib/Cro/WebSocket/MessageSerializer.pm6#L72

[23:22] <japhb> Shouldn't that be `$so.break($_);` (replacing $m with $so in that line)?

[23:54] <japhb> Also, why does keeping the serialization outcome happen *before* the emit here: https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/blob/master/lib/Cro/WebSocket/MessageSerializer.pm6#L24  but happens *after* the emit in the following LAST block?

[23:55] <japhb> Shouldn't those both be after, in order to ensure the serialization outcome promise is not kept until all the stages of the serialization pipeline have succeeded?  (Or if not, that the QUIT or CATCH blocks have triggered?)

[23:57] <japhb> Granted that this change might reduce concurrency a bit, since the SO is awaited at https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/blob/master/lib/Cro/WebSocket/Client/Connection.pm6#L127

[23:57] <japhb> I guess whatever order is chosen, it should be the *same* order in MessageSerializer
