[09:25] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: Wow!

[09:53] *** sena_kun left
[09:59] <Altreus> is there a bot here that links me to docs?

[10:00] <Altreus> eh that should be a #raku question tbh

[10:00] *** sena_kun joined
[10:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: That looks really good, and gives me all I need to figure out how to do it that way on the socket also. Thanks!

[10:08] <Altreus> japhb++ # I don't understand it and jnthn learned from it so it must be good

[10:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> Altreus: Log::Timeline is a way to instrument programs with logging of events (things at a point in time) and tasks (things that happen over time). There's a visualizer in Comma. It's integrated in Cro in various places. At the moment it uses JSON serialization; japhb++ has demonstrated using CBOR instead, which is more compact and hopefully faster.

[10:12] <Altreus> Ah yeah, you suggested Log::Timeline to myself and kawaii_ but I looked at it and went "argh" and I didn't actually make use of it :D

[10:12] <jnthnwrthngtn> Why "argh"? :D

[10:13] <Altreus> Everything new was argh at the time

[10:13] <Altreus> It may yet be argh but I don't have a specific reason why

[10:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> ah, ok :)

[10:14] <Altreus> Honestly raku is still a bit argh but it's because I'm busy with not-raku

[10:14] <Altreus> I don't have the brain space for that many contexts :)

[10:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah, fair enough :)

[10:17] <Altreus> wish I could fit in some time though; I really want API::Discord to be useful

[19:15] <japhb> Ah, very happy to see my PR hit the mark.  Thanks for merging, jnthnwrthngtn!  :-)

[19:16] * japhb watches as Cro::WebApp slowly becomes "Mason, reimagined for the 2020s".  :-)

[19:16] * japhb used Mason for several jobs, and likes Cro::WebApp, so it's making me pretty happy
