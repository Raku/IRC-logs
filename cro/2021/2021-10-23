[13:41] <Xliff> Can someone tell me where to set the raku executable location in Comma

[13:41] <Xliff> Then I need a way to set -I locations.

[13:41] <Xliff> Thanks!

[13:50] <sena_kun> Xliff, File -> Project Structure -> "Project SDK".

[13:50] <sena_kun> Xliff, `-I` locations are set as cli arguments in run configurations. So you go to `Run... -> Configure Run Configurations` (or something, don't remember exactly), then you select a script you want to run and specify arguments to raku.

[13:51] <Xliff> sena_kun: Am doing that with the latest Comma and getting weird results. It's stuck on a specific raku version and will not acknowledge settings.

[13:52] <sena_kun> Hmm, I'm afraid I'll need a more specific report / steps to reproduce on Monday.

[13:54] <Xliff> *sigh* -- I'll see what I can do, but I know its environmental, so not conducive to reproductive step writing

[13:54] <Xliff> How can I use another font other than Noto Sans?

[13:55] <sena_kun> File -> Settings, searching for `Font` should find you something.

[13:56] <Xliff> Yep, thanks.

[14:24] <Xliff> sena_kun: If I want to step into the source for a 3rd party .pm6 -- how would I go about tonig that. I've been neck teemam hour.

[14:24] <Xliff> Er...

[14:24] <Xliff> sena_kun: If I want to step into the source for a 3rd party .pm6 -- how would I go about doing that.

[14:24] <Xliff> Yep. I think that means its time for a nap.

[14:26] <sena_kun> Xliff, perhaps. The bad news is I am not sure what you're asking about works. The good news is that we have a lot of debugserver fixes in the next moarvm and Comma release, so this will already be some progress related to breakpoints, stepping etc.

[18:53] <Xliff> sena_kun: Regardless, thanks for the help!

[18:54] <Xliff> sena_kun: The only thing I need right now is how to set up source locations for the various modules I am using.

[18:59] <sena_kun> Xliff, do you mean to set locations to inspect them in "External Libraries" or?

[18:59] <sena_kun> Or to get local paths in stack traces?

[19:00] <Xliff> External Libraries

[19:01] <sena_kun> Xliff, alright, probably bad news for you is: it takes source locations from zef, so one needs to have modules installed with it.

[19:01] <Xliff> Hahahah! Sure it does.

[19:02] <Xliff> sena_kun: You'll need to fix that. Not every raku hacker use zef!

[19:02] <sena_kun> Yes, we have Pakku support for installing dependencies, but not for this, though it should be easy to implement.

[19:02] <sena_kun> :P

[19:02] <Xliff> Many of us have issues with CURI and have loads of unpublished stuff sitting in directories like ~/Projects

[19:03] <sena_kun> Jokes aside, I get what you mean.

[19:03] <Xliff> sena_kun: That should have been done BEFORE zef support! Manual addition of external sources!

[19:03] <sena_kun> Alas, this exact bit of the intellij platform is LTA, we had some serious issues with just hacking up this much, hmm.

[19:04] <Xliff> I'm surprised that this is an intellij problem. Would have thought they would have made it easy.

[19:04] <sena_kun> Xliff, we did what we could with what we had to support majority of use cases.

[19:04] <Xliff> But then again... I've been pretty insatistied with all things intellij.

[19:04] <Xliff> sena_kun: Not arguing that at all.

[19:05] <Xliff> Comma is a nice piece of work. Been a supporter since ... 2017?

[19:05] <sena_kun> Well, it's a sort of historical issue, I guess. In the past it was very Java-specific and with time things became more and more general there, which is a good thing. But anything related to libraries still makes me shiver when I think about hacking on it, huh.

[19:06] <Xliff> LOL! OK. Fair point.

[20:08] <lizmat> this may have nothing to do with Cro or Cro::WebApp, but it's annoying anyway:

[20:08] <lizmat> $ zef install Cro::WebApp

[20:08] <lizmat> All candidates are currently installed

[20:08] <lizmat> $ raku -Ilib -MCro::WebApp -e ''

[20:08] <lizmat> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e

[20:08] <lizmat> Could not find Cro::WebApp in:

[20:11] <lizmat> $ raku -MCro::WebApp -e ''

[20:11] <lizmat> ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e

[20:11] <lizmat> Could not find Cro::WebApp in:

[20:18] <lizmat> zef nuke site --confirm 

[20:59] * lizmat calls it a day
