[16:29] <Xliff> I'm having trouble getting the template-location function of Cro::WebApp::Template working.

[16:30] <Xliff> How can I debug how this works?

[16:32] <sena_kun> Xliff, can you please specify what kind of trouble do you have?

[16:33] <Xliff> I specify the template-location and the template command never finds them.

[16:35] <sena_kun> Xliff, 1)(it should not affect, but) where is your call to template-location? 2)what if you try absolute path to the directory?

[16:41] <Xliff> I'm callnig template-location in my routes sub.

[16:44] <Xliff> Hm. OK.... now they work! LOL.

[16:45] <sena_kun> yay

[16:59] <Xliff> sena_kun: Another thing... adding custom HTML for a field in the form.

[16:59] <Xliff> I have a design I'm thinking of. I'm taking inspiration from the "will select" trait.

[17:00] <Xliff> Something like "will render-field-as" which accepts a callback that will return the markup to be used in that form.

[17:01] <Xliff> Callback then takes the current value of the field.

[17:01] <Xliff> Soemthing like that.

[17:01] <Xliff> :)

[17:11] <sena_kun> Xliff, sorry, I did not work with forms (yet), so living a useless life here. :(

[18:58] <Xliff> sena_kun: Can you pass callables into a Cro::WebApp::Template?

[22:16] <JRaspass> I too would like to know that, or perhaps how to make new builtins like `<&HTML>` from raku side rather than templates
