[16:29] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: Happy Holidays. I have to take a moment to thank you again for Cro. I just had a demo of my Cro-based application server for $dayJob.

[16:29] <Xliff> Interesting noises were made.

[16:30] <Xliff> And given that this tangentially relates to what I'm working on, I have to ask: How much work is left on RakuAST, and when do you think you'll restart development?

[16:30] <Xliff> I have several initiatives, including the 

[16:30] <Xliff> app server that could benefit from it.

[17:02] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: I have tag-based content I am reading into a file, and I'd like to insert that into a template as-is. When I try and do using .render({ tag-content => $tag-file.IO.slurp }) it is being escaped.

[17:02] <Xliff> How can I avoid that?

[17:03] <lizmat> &HTML(...) ?

[17:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, <&HTML(.tag-content)> or <&HTML-AND-JAVASCRIPT(.tag-content)> (the first tries to do some XSS protection)

[17:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> (and the second just spits out what you give it)

[17:06] <Xliff> Is &HTML available in sub form?

[17:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template#Inserting_HTML_and_JavaScript is the docs, btw

[17:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> Glad to hear about the successful demo :)

[17:06] <Xliff> Thanks.

[17:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> There's a lot left on RakuAST, alas. Will hopefully dig back into it in the new year. The last month or so has been a mix of unexpectedly busy time at $dayjob combined with a month long cold-ish thing.

[17:10] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: Ah! No worries. Hope you feel better, soon!

[17:10] <Xliff> If you find you need some help with the RakuAST work when it is restarted, please let me know!

[18:16] <Xliff> http://71.225.227.73:20000/counties

[18:18] <Xliff> Can anyone see the above link?

[18:18] <lizmat> times out for me

[18:20] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: to me too

[18:30] <Xliff> *sigh*

[18:37] <Xliff> Try now.

[18:45] *** Altai-man left
[18:55] <lizmat> still timing out for me

[18:56] <lizmat> Xliff ^^

[18:56] <Xliff> Odd. I can pick it up from my cell and my tablet.

[19:00] <lizmat> traceroute seems to loop to 68.85.193.174 and back again to 68.85.193.174

[19:02] <Xliff> Hrrm.... it might be intercontinental.

[19:02] <Xliff> Thanks FIOS.
