[07:38] <Xliff_> How do I get the raw JSON from request to a JSON endpoint using Cro::HTTP::Client?

[10:22] <jnthnwrthngtn> Xliff_: $resp.body-text instead of $resp.body

[10:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> (Or $resp.body-blob if you want it ever less cooked :))

[10:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> *even

[10:56] <Xliff_> jnthnwrthngtn:  Thanks!

[14:13] <lizmat> bumped Cro to 0.8.7 and fixed my first Nil warning thanks to the new more precise message

[14:13] <lizmat> sadly, I'm still seeing: Use of Nil in string context

[14:13] <lizmat>   in block  at EVAL_9 line 200

[14:14] <lizmat> passing by... maybe with the initial template parsing?

[21:29] <lizmat> logs.liz.nl now running on Cro 0.8.7

[21:31] <lizmat> so this template snippet:

[21:31] <lizmat>     <?{ .channel ne $c }>

[21:31] <lizmat>                   <li id="<$c>">

[21:31] <lizmat>                     <a

[21:31] <lizmat>                       <?$is-home>href="/<$c>/index.html"</?>

[21:32] <lizmat> is generating a warning on the last line

[21:32] <lizmat> the only way I can think of this, is that $is-home is Nil, but that shouldn't be an issue in a condition, should it ?

[21:33] <lizmat> it cannot be $c. because then I'd also get a warning on the 2nd line of that snippet

[21:33] * lizmat is confused

[21:34] <lizmat> two other warnings point to lines that do not have any variable in them, such as "</div>"

[21:35] * lizmat calls it a day
