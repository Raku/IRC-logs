[03:12] <xinming> what is Cro::Iri? I saw we have this module, does it mean internal resource identifier?

[05:38] <japhb> International, IIRC

[07:02] <xinming> got it, thanks

[12:45] <lizmat> Q: can I use the same Cro::HTTP::Client simultaneously from multiple threads ?

[12:46] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes

[12:47] <lizmat> ok, so that could not be the reason I'm getting:

[12:47] <lizmat>     Header table index 82 out of range

[12:47] <lizmat>       in method resolve-decoded-index at /Users/liz/Github/rakudo.moar/install/share/perl6/site/sources/4CC285A8AB160824E5A42DC6EF776B610FCEB2F9 (HTTP::HPACK) line 258

[12:47] <lizmat> (which is on new-disp, maybe I should revert to master ftm?)

[12:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> It shouldn't be causing any concurrency around that, no

[12:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> Weird...wonder if it's something in the HPACK impl

[12:48] <lizmat> ok...   I guess I'll switch back to master for sanity  :-)

[12:49] <jnthnwrthngtn> Worth a check. You can also force HTTP/1.1 as a workaround.

[12:59] <lizmat> fwiw, master gives the same error

[13:00] <lizmat> fg

[13:00] <lizmat> guess I'm going to take out the .race  :-)

[13:42] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: I have a golf of the problem, interested ?

[13:47] <lizmat> adding :http<1.1> to the client init fixes the issue

[13:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> oh, so not even about parallelism

[13:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> Please make an issue on cro-http

[13:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> I've got my head in callwith semantics at the moment

[14:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> Thanks
