[16:11] <raku-curious> Hi, I'm looking for some help installing Cro

[16:12] <raku-curious> I'm attempting to install via zef, and it's failing because it can't find the dependency "CBOR::Simple"

[16:12] <raku-curious> Details here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69842180/difficulties-installing-cro-failed-to-find-dependencies-cborsimple

[16:14] <sena_kun> raku-curious, can you please post output of `zef --version`?

[16:24] <raku-curious> Yes, here it is: v0.9.4

[16:24] <raku-curious> I installed it via apt

[16:29] <sena_kun> alas, that's way too old. I would suggest to look at https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/

[16:36] <raku-curious> OK, thanks for the tip. Looking into it now

[17:03] <japhb> Ah, looks like we gave the same advice in 3 different places.  :-)

[17:03] <japhb> Points for persistence!

[17:18] <japhb> My code is now a canary for old zef packages.  >.<
