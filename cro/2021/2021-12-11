[18:16] <Xliff> lizmat: Why is logs.liz.nl returning results for "quantum" that don't have the word "quantum" in it?

[18:16] <lizmat> ?

[18:16] <lizmat> interesting

[18:17] <lizmat> do you have a URL ?

[19:24] <lizmat> Xliff ??

[20:23] <Xliff> lizmat: Yeah, I can get you one. One sec.

[20:23] <Xliff> Sorry. I have been running around the internets and also stuffing my face.

[20:23] <Xliff> Got distracted.

[20:24] <Xliff> lizmat: Now 502 Bad Gateway...

[20:25] <lizmat> ok, it's down alright, and doesn't come up because of weird errors

[20:25] <lizmat> I'm also in a meeting atm  :-)

[21:02] <lizmat> Xliff: it's up again now

[21:02] <lizmat> this was *really* weird...

[21:02] <lizmat> it started complaining about too many open files

[21:02] <lizmat> while re-precompiling modules

[21:03] <lizmat> I decided to uninstall Cro::HTTP, install that again

[21:03] <lizmat> and then  restart: that apparently did not put something over the limit

[21:04] <lizmat> even a "raku -MCro::HTTP::Server -e ''" would result in that error
