[15:10] <Xliff_> OK. I am having some resource issues with Cro.

[15:10] <Xliff_> Every time I serve a page, the raku compiler quietly ticks up memory until it uses it all up. This is on a VM. For the life of me I can figure out why this is happening.

[15:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> First, ensure you are running the latest Cro release, which did have a fix for a memory leak.

[15:19] <Xliff_> jnthnwrthngtn: Thanks for mentioning that. I updated yesterday. Is that recent enough?

[15:24] <Xliff_> I can't seem to duplicate the issue on my development machine. I will have to open it up to external requests :/

[15:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, yesterday is

[15:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> Last release was...a week or maybe 2 ago

[15:34] <Xliff_> OK. Thanks. When I have more for you I will let you know.

[15:35] <Xliff_> Can you suggest anything to look at for debugging? Any ENV varaiables or switches I could use or print out that might be helpful?

[15:44] <jnthnwrthngtn> Not really, I'd try to golf it down to the minimum route handler that leaks (remove middlewhare, logic in route handler, etc.)

[15:46] <Xliff_> Well, when I can trigger the leak, I will attempt to do so, but I think it has something to do with database access. I haven't been able to trigger it without at least one query run.

[19:00] <Xliff> So. It looks like the request never completes. I'm using PHP's Curl extension to perform my requests, and control to the script doesn't immediately move to the next statement after the call to ->curl_exec. 

[19:00] <Xliff> Memory starts increasing if there is database access (or at least a database INSERT)  during that request.

[21:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> Dunno if you're using Comma, but if so run it under timeline view and see if it shows that it's just stuck in the route action

[21:50] <jnthnwrthngtn> (Otherwise you're at scattring debug output to see if it makes it through the route logic, or gets wedged in the database call)
