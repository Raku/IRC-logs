[01:14] <japhb> I FINALLY figured out why the MUGS WebSocket connections were always sending empty continuation frames after every data frame: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core/commit/c7eb0861002b1a80a3d85add65728dad2fcc8203

[18:47] <lizmat> hmmm...  are you supposed to be able to include a template consisting of just Javascript functions?

[19:04] <lizmat> aah... it's ok as long as you don't have a condition using <   :-)

[19:17] <lizmat> meh: it appears that a .crotmp that has just JS functions, does not get included in the source

[19:18] <lizmat> even though it must be syntactically correct

[19:26] <lizmat> I guess it makes more sense to just put them in a .js file  :-)
