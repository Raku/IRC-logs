[07:55] <japhb> Testing of Cro::WebApp from GitHub HEAD gives:

[07:55] <japhb> [Cro::WebApp] Could not locate template 'literal.crotmp'

[07:59] <lizmat> is that something I broke?

[07:59] <japhb> I saw that in several rebuilds, but I was paying way more attention the last few, so I can't rule out that it was already there before.

[08:00] <japhb> When I get the results of the full rebuild against Rakudo HEAD tomorrow morning, I'll check this specifically.

[08:00] <japhb> But I mention it here before going to bed in case it's trivial for the Cro folks to recreate and fix.

[08:01] <lizmat> ack

[08:01] <lizmat> sleep well  :-)

[08:01] <japhb> thx &

[09:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: Do the tests fail or is it just a bit of stray diagnostic output?

[18:10] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: The tests seem to pass, but it doesn't look like diagnostic output either; it gives an exception backtrace.  I wanted to make sure that was intentional.

[20:31] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: Ah, yes, seems there's a test that we don't incorrectly find a template that should not be in the search path, and that does produce an exception message to the terminal by default (good for folks debugging rather than a silent 500)

[20:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> It's harmless, but worth supressing since it looks concerning :)

[20:59] <japhb> Ah gotcha
