[10:01] <lizmat> meh, after upgrading Cro, my IRC log server dies with:

[10:01] <lizmat> P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol Router

[10:47] <lizmat> update: so I had all my code using an explicit version of Cro: 0.8.5

[10:47] <lizmat> after upgrading, things started to fail

[10:48] <lizmat> changing all the use statements to 0.8.6 explicitely, solved the problem

[10:48] <lizmat> so it feels to me Cro is internally not using an explicit version, and that causes issues?

[12:54] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oddly, 0.8.6 is the first release where we actually did declare versiond dependencies of all the Cro parts in META6.json

[12:54] <jnthnwrthngtn> So this is the release where you should have been least likely to see such a problem

[13:16] <Xliff> Good morning.

[13:16] <Xliff> I'm getting the following error when I use a post-block within a route-block:

[13:17] <Xliff> Dynamic variable $*CRO-ROUTE-SET not found

[13:23] <Xliff> Ah! The above comes from spelling the top-level route {} as "routes"

[13:24] <Xliff> So I am now getting the following error, since my top-level routes is a single include():

[13:24] <Xliff> "Can only use 'include' with `route` block, not a Nil"

[13:26] <Xliff> Ah! Again solved. One of the included was missing its surrounding route-block

[13:53] <Xliff> OK, for the time being, "template-location" does not seem to be working from a route-block, so I am using hardcoded locations.

[13:54] <Xliff> After fixing a few bugs, I have run into a bit of a problem,.

[13:54] <Xliff> <:use My::CompUnit>, where My::CompUnit is a simple Raku package containing a single exported sub is not finding that sub for use.

[13:55] <Xliff> The explanation here seems to refer to templates: https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template#Template_modules

[13:55] <Xliff> I would like some of my subs available to the templates. How can this be accomplished?

[14:09] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: declaring in META does not make it load that version in an unversioned "use" statement, I don't think

[15:54] <Xliff> Cro release from yesterday is not recognized by zef.

[15:55] <Xliff> I tried to upgrade on the work dev environment (which hasn't been touched in months) and zef still thinks it's at the previous version.

[15:55] <lizmat> that's strange: "zef upgrade" upgraded it for me

[15:55] <Xliff> cdf
