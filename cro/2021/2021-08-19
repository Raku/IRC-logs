[19:51] <nine> Did You Know...? That using Cro::HTTP::Middleware::RequestResponse's response processing leaks memory like crazy?

[20:01] <nine> Cro::HTTP::Middleware::Response however does not

[20:08] <nine> It seems to be the mere tapping of $connection-state.early-responses that starts the leak. Even though AFAICT nothing's ever emitted from it.

[20:10] <nine> Oh, no it's not the tapping. It's the additional whenever in the supply created by Response's transformer method

[20:12] <nine> Yeah, I can replace it with a whenever Supply.interval(1) { } and it will still leak. Remove that whenever block and the leak vanishes.
