[10:00] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: 
[10:00] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: We'll also make it so that Cro::WebApp::Template can serve resources.
[10:00] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: However, it would be nice if we only had to associate the resources with
[10:00] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: the routes using `resources-from` once for both serving static files and
[10:00] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: for templates; templates will then need a single extra opt-in to say
[10:01] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: that resources should be considered. Therefore, expose a sub that can be
[10:01] <Geth> ¦ cro-http/router-plugin-api-and-resources: used to resolve a resource, so Cro::WebApp::Template can use that.

[10:01] <Altreus> verbose commit messages are nice and all but heck
[10:02] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: jnthn++ created pull request #142: Router plugin API and corrected handling of serving resources
[10:02] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/142
[10:13] <jnthnwrthngtn> Especially so when I mess something up so push a new version of one of the commits :)
[10:14] <Altreus> the main problem with force-push is robots xD
[10:17] <jnthnwrthngtn> I've not found humans on the receiving end of them universally better... :)
[10:19] <Altreus> that's a clue-stick issue
[10:19] <Altreus> Every time a human has had a problem with my force-push I have had to quiz them on why they were using my branch in the first place

[16:05] <lizmat> I wish it would tell me the line in the template, or in my code instead  :-)
[16:29] <jnthnwrthngtn> That may be possible, please make an issue in cro-webapp
