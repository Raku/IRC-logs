[11:55] <SmokeMachine> Would you guys mind if I ask a RakuAST question here?

[11:56] <SmokeMachine> I'm trying to start playing with custom pass to start the research on how to add that for Red...

[11:56] <SmokeMachine> but I'm not even being able to start... any idea? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OM9Xoewg/image.png

[11:56] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: I think everybody's mindset is still sort of in the new-disp realm

[11:57] <lizmat> perhaps jnthnwrthngtn can give more clarity

[11:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm not sure the commit to enable that ever made it into the rakuast branch

[11:58] <SmokeMachine> hum... that makes sense... I've grepped EXPORT-POST-CHECK-PASS on the code and I haven't find anything...

[11:59] <SmokeMachine> ok... so I think I'll try again in the near future... (I'm interested on playing with it... I think it will be a great improvement on Red)

[12:00] <SmokeMachine> thank you lizmat and jnthnwrthngtn
