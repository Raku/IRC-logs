[12:35] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: : How difficult would it be to allow the opening and closing tags for .crotmp files to be user configurable?

[12:36] <Xliff> While greatly enjoying the feature, I find my eyes lose ::Webapp::Template tags within my HTML, and would like them to stand out more.

[12:36] <Xliff> Especially when using vanilla editors with no special highlighters.

[13:17] <Altai-man> Xliff, hi. jnthn is vacating now. I imagine it would be a bit annoying to do sanely, plus introducing tons of user slangs is a bad idea. What you really want is to have support for various editors, not making writing support for them a lot more complex IMO.

[15:24] <Xliff> Actually, I want support for WebApp::Template tags to NOT LOOK LIKE HTML. Hence the request.

[15:25] <Xliff> And I've been working on it a little, today.

[15:25] <Xliff> And you are correct. It's a little hard to get done right.

[19:18] <japhb> Xliff: Are you looking for something like Mustache, but with Cro::Webapp::Template semantics?

[19:29] <Xliff> japhb: Something more like Template::Toolkit
