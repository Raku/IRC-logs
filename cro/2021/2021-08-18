[10:04] <lizmat> SmokeMachine_  not that I know of specifically

[10:05] <lizmat> what kind of signature should I use for a URL of the form "foo.html?stuff_without_name

[10:05] <lizmat> " ?

[10:06] <SmokeMachine_> thanks, I've used Test::Mock like this: https://github.com/FCO/SimpleDebit/blob/main/t/03-simple-debit.rakutest#L39

[10:06] <lizmat> I think that is what is being used for these cases, yes

[10:06] <SmokeMachine_> lizmat: ^^

[10:10] <lizmat> guess I should just use foo.html/stuff_without_name as the url  :-)

[10:11] <lizmat> but meh

[10:11] <SmokeMachine_> maybe `stuff_without_name => True`? I'm just gessing

[10:20] <SmokeMachine_> sorry, you want a route I was thinking on request, sorry

[10:22] <lizmat> I sorta expected a URL foo.html?stuff with a route of 'foo.html', :%args

[10:22] <lizmat> to have %args<query> to contain "stuff"

[10:22] <lizmat> instead %args contains { stuff => "" }

[10:24] <lizmat> guess I'll use %args.keys.first for now

[10:25] <SmokeMachine_> maybe *%args?

[10:26] <lizmat> ??

[10:33] <SmokeMachine_> I meant something like this:

[10:33] <SmokeMachine_> m: sub a(*%args) { dd %args }; a :stuff

[10:33] <SmokeMachine_> but I couldn't make it work on my tests with cro

[10:35] <SmokeMachine_> `get -> *%stuff { ... }` warns errors... `Use of uninitialized value element of type Any in string context`

[10:37] <SmokeMachine_> the :%args you said worked here to me!

[10:37] <lizmat> yeah, that works ok...  it's just that for a URL like foo.html?stuff

[10:38] <lizmat> I sorta expected it to wind up as { query => 'stuff' } 

[10:38] <lizmat> rather than { stuff => "" }

[10:39] <SmokeMachine_> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/m7Rl18p9/image.png

[10:39] <SmokeMachine_> ok, now I think I got it... sorry for my confusion

[10:43] <lizmat> yup, that's it

[10:44] <lizmat> expected to see {:query("stuff")}
