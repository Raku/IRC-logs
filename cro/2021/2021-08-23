[05:27] <japhb> Random possibly interesting note for those wanting to archive Cro/Log::Timeline logs: I was checking output size compressibility, and I did a trivial comparison of a million log lines in JSON lines and CBOR sequence forms, compressed with zstd at various levels.  Turns out that CBOR was not only smaller to start with (~1.6x, for my test case), but compressed better as well (over double the compression ratio, 

[05:27] <japhb> leaving the compressed CBOR versions 3.6-3.7x smaller than the compressed JSON).

[05:30] <japhb> These were chosen to be quite uniform lines, with no extra data, so I would expect not quite as stark a difference with live data, but it's still pretty good.  Best compressed CBOR.zst size was about 2.4 bytes per log line.  Even default compression was less than 4 bytes per log line.

[05:33] <japhb> Those are probably nearly best possible results, of course, barring rampant cheating like naming an event ['','',''] or somesuch

[05:34] <japhb> Actually, now I wonder how small that would be, hmmm ...

[05:48] <japhb> Welp, that's impressive.  Brings best compressed CBOR down to 2.04 bytes per (totally cheated) log line, and as a result over 4x smaller than the best compressed JSON version (at 8.26 bytes per log line).

[05:49] <japhb> Now I need to go the opposite direction and compare with some big chunks of live data from my app (which probably means writing up a stress test script for it or somesuch).  But not tonight I think.  :-)

[10:05] <Xliff> \o

[10:06] <Xliff> Will the "static" function accept relative paths in its signature?

[10:07] <Xliff> Or does it always need to be a node list from the root?

[12:27] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: Hope your vacation was relaxing and invigorating!

[12:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> Well, more physically active than non-vacation, but mentally more relaxing at least :)

[13:10] <Xliff> Excellent! I saw the talk you gave prior, and loved the landscape. Would like to get out there, someday.

[13:11] <Xliff> (And the talk was great, too!)

[14:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, it's a really nice area.

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork: 

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork: Here we do three things:

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork: * Before that, URLs constructed for a route had no idea they can be used

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork:   in some outer route block, so they generated `/foo` instead of `/included-prefix/foo`.

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork:   To overcome this, we add an url-prefix attribute when we include a handler we rewrite

[17:22] <Geth> Â¦ cro-http/link-gen-no-fork:   it to an appropriate value.
