[14:10] <lizmat> question: is there a way to include a Cro template based on a variable setting ?

[14:12] <lizmat> I guess not, as the template is compiled *before* it knows of any variables, right ?

[14:43] <jnthnwrthngtn> Correct.

[14:44] <lizmat> so what would be the best way to produce a piece of text depending on a variable\s value?

[14:45] <lizmat> basically: how do I most handily expose a hash with texts ?

[14:45] <lizmat> with the variable being the key ?

[17:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> Pass the hash into the template also and then index it?

[17:48] <jnthnwrthngtn> e.g. <.texts{$key}>

[17:57] <lizmat> well, yes, I came up with basically

[17:58] <lizmat> sub descriptions($io) { $io.dir.map: { .basename => .slurp.chomp } }
