[12:47] <Xliff> Does Cro::WebApp::Template have a given/when mechanism?

[13:44] <Altai-man> Xliff, no (maybe "not yet").

[14:45] <Xliff> Altai-man: It can be done. Just a series of <?.topic eq "value>...</?> statements.

[14:45] <Xliff> But I think a mechanism could be developed where it could be nicer.

[14:47] <Xliff> <*.topic><- value1></-><- "Value 2"></-></*>

[14:47] <Xliff> That would expand out into what I just said, above.

[16:49] <Altai-man> Xliff, aaaah, I misunderstood you, sorry. I thought you want `given` to define a "sub-topic", not to match. for given/when yes, conditions will do, there is no sugar to this though.

[18:31] <Xliff> Do you think that little bit of sugar I suggested above would be a worthwhile PR?

[18:32] <japhb> Xliff: Normally I would say "Ask jnthnwrthngtn whether he likes that syntax and is likely to accept it first, so as to avoid rework" -- but he's on vacation, so you might have to decide if it's worth the risk of having to rework it if he decides on different sugar.

[19:25] <Xliff> japhb:  Good point. I think I'll poike around with it, then. What can it hurt? Thanks for the help, everyone!
