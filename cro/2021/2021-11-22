[20:39] <lizmat> question: if I have a static file, I can send that with "static"

[20:39] <lizmat> it however looks like that doesn't set any "E-tag" or "Modified" headers

[20:40] <lizmat> is that something that is pass√© in HTTP world nowadays?

[20:40] <lizmat> the reason I'm asking is that on logs.liz.nl, I see real visitors *always* reload the js and images

[20:41] <lizmat> and looking at developer options in Safari, claims it has no response headers

[20:44] <lizmat> I sorta would have expected to see a Last-Modified / Expires / Etag header

[20:44] <lizmat> or is that something that has to be done manually ?

[20:46] <lizmat> afk&
