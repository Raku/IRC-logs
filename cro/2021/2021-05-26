[21:08] <colomon> Sorry to bother here, my IRC client is letting me see this channel but not #raku.
[21:09] <japhb> That's ... odd.
[21:09] <japhb> colomon: Can you see any other Raku channels, like #raku-dev?
[21:10] <japhb> (Or #raku-gamedev, or whatever)
[21:11] <colomon> If I filter rooms on “raku”, I get cro.  
[21:11] <colomon> that’s it.
[21:11] <colomon> I tried just typing raku and #raku, and it just seems to ignore me.
[21:12] <colomon> … and now they’re actually there for me.  Weird.
[21:13] <colomon> … still no #raku for me, but I do have #raku-dev, #rake-gamede, #raku-land
[21:15] <colomon> at any rate, thanks for listening!  (And I’ve been using a very small private Cro as a key work component for three or four years now… but haven’t done any recent development at all.)
[21:22] <colomon> (Seems like it is slowly downloading channel info in the background, now up to 11 hits on the word “raku” but still no #raku itself.)
