[10:19] <lizmat> sanity check: Cro::WebApp::Template does not have the concept of an "else" does it ?

[10:21] *** sena_kun joined
[10:31] <Altreus> rolling for a sanity check at this time of day seems like a doomed endeavour

[10:32] <Altreus> Instead of knocking that question off with spam I think i'll start a GH discussion

[10:34] <lizmat> Altreus++

[10:36] <jnthnwrthngtn> lizmat: No

[10:36] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn++  # clarity  :-)

[10:52] <Altreus> https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/44

[10:52] <Altreus> hope I represented that correctly

[10:52] <Altreus> I'm kind of eager to see this now!

[10:52] <Altreus> I haven't used a structure-aware language since Odoo removed their awesome PDF template language

[10:53] <Altreus> and replaced it with, you guessed it, a dumb byte-stream generator

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> Beyond what lizmat said, I think

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> <$_.link^? a href="<$_.link>"><$_.text></$>

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> Should be spelled

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> <?$_.link a href="<$_.link>"><$_.text></$>

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> Basically the whole thing hangs of that in Raku terms would be a TTIAR error

[10:56] <lizmat> funny how I just wrote that as well :-)

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> gah

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> *hangs off

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> *what

[10:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> Also all the $_ mentions are not needed

[10:57] <Altreus> ?X and ^?X would be different

[10:57] <Altreus> Yeah I realised that towards the end

[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> Would be: <?.link a href="<.link>"><.text></?>

[10:58] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: shouldn't that close with </?> instead of </$> ?

[10:58] <lizmat> ok

[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> lizmat: Yes, just noticed that also :)

[10:58] <Altreus> yeah that's nice consistency

[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> What's the ^ about?

[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> I didn't really get why that's there

[10:58] <Altreus> conditional wrap vs conditional entire tree

[10:58] <Altreus> ^? is *this tag* is conditional

[10:59] <Altreus> ? is *this tree* is conditional

[10:59] <Altreus> <^?x>y</^?> would always print y

[10:59] <lizmat> what's the difference ?

[10:59] <lizmat> ah

[10:59] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh, I see. Hmmm.

[10:59] <Altreus> but sometimes it would wrap it with whatever is in the special tag

[11:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> OK, I get the use case. I don't like that exact syntax proposal.

[11:00] <Altreus> This is my single most hated problem in writing temlpated HTML

[11:00] <Altreus> that's OK, I wanted to express the use case and not the syntax :D

[11:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> Altreus++ # this is a really nice idea overall

[11:00] <Altreus> thanks :D

[11:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> It doesn't make the parse nor compilation excessively more complex either, and hangs off something that'd be an error today

[11:02] <Altreus> oh good, that was my original premise

[11:02] <jnthnwrthngtn> If folks wouldn't confuse it with something hash-like % would be a natural choice for "put this either side" :)

[11:03] <lizmat> %% ?

[11:03] <Altreus> I feel like <SYMBOL ...> is a useful space to explore

[11:03] <Altreus> I picked ^? because it sort of meant "maybe parent" in my head

[11:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> The overall principle is < followed by a non-identifier char is for the template engine. We do play with fire a little on doctype declarations and comments.

[11:05] <Altreus> good thing comments have such a long token

[11:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, those aren't so bad

[11:06] <Altreus> also CDATA I suppose

[11:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm slightly pondering whether we refine it from "identifier char" to "letter char", because I don't think there's any HTML elements or things in that space starting with _

[11:07] <jnthnwrthngtn> Then folks could write <_(.blah)> instead of <&_(.blah)> for inserting a translation

[11:07] <Altreus> Based on my vague memories of using custom elements, _ is not valid in a tag name

[11:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> Given if folks are doing that they probably will write it really quite often.

[11:08] <Altreus> / '<' $NON-TAG-CHAR /

[11:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> (There's already a PR for basic i18n stuff that does it with `<&_(.blah)>`)

[11:10] <lizmat> fwiw, I think <_(.blah)> would be too hard to read

[11:10] <lizmat> I like it that the <& indicates something will get executed

[11:11] <lizmat> and probably would continue using <&_ myself

[11:17] <Altreus> I spent all my attention mojo on this :(

[11:17] <Altreus> Now I don't wanna do my job

[11:24] * jnthnwrthngtn is trying to do work on the thing he's meant to today rather that trying to implement the idea :)

[11:25] <Altreus> :)
