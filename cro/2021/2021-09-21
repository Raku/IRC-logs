[22:55] <Xliff> What's the best way to instrospect an Inline::Perl5 object?

[22:56] <Xliff> I want the underlying P5 data, not the data of Inline::Perl5. 

[22:56] <Xliff> Is this even possible?

[22:58] <japhb> Xliff: Ask perl5 to answer?  (Meaning, introspect the object using Perl code, and then return the results of that introspection back to Raku space)

[23:09] <Xliff> japhb: This was meant as an Inline::Perl5 questino.

[23:09] <Xliff> What you are suggesting will not translate.
