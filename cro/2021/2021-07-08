[07:49] <lizmat> hmmm... should that have been announced by Geth here ?

[08:50] <japhb> Depends on whether the webhook was set to send PRs, I suppose.  I think the default is pushes only.

[08:55] <lizmat> yeah... I'm just wondering whether someone *did* adjust the webhooks

[08:56] <lizmat> or that they are still pointing to somewhere else than webhooks.liz.nl

[10:05] <Altreus> well it previously did -  ⤷ | ¦ cro-http: jnthn++ created pull request #143: Warn if a `route` block is sunk

[10:05] <Altreus> so I'm guessin' it needs a-fixin'

[10:12] <lizmat> well, I kicked it... :-)

[10:21] <Altreus> great now we need a new one

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: 4 commits pushed by (Geoffrey Broadwell)++, (Jonathan Worthington)++

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: 1605a7ea83 | Fix typo that made test always succeed

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: 2914bb8f2e | Allow double quotes around YAML keys in tests

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: e1cfc5a432 | Optionally quote env var name in YAML tests as well

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: 702854cbff | Merge pull request #139 from japhb/master

[13:50] <Geth> ¦ cro/master: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro/compare/6a48de0e2f0f...702854cbff08

[13:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> I updated the URL in the most commonly modified Cro repos, I guess there'll be a webhooks.raku.org at some point so we're not tied to any individual hosting it, and will update the rest once there is

[13:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> *webhook URL

[15:47] *** patrickb left
[15:48] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: yeah, that is the plan

[15:49] <lizmat> fwiw, I would like the webhooks to have some persistence, so that if the channel isn't reachable for some reason, they would be pushed whenever the channel did become available

[19:16] <japhb> Thanks for the merge, jnthnwrthngtn  :-)
