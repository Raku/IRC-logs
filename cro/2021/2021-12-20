[19:40] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: Nice job on the new Cro features.

[19:40] <Xliff> Are things like resource-from and templates-from-resources lexical? 

[19:43] <Xliff> Ala 'route { { resources-from %?RESOURCES; templates-from-resources; get -> { template 'templates/index.crotmp' }; }; { template-location 'templates1'; get -> 'from', 'the', 'filesystem' { template 'mytpage.crotmp' }; };  }'

[19:43] <Xliff> (hope I got the blocks right...)

[22:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> Xliff: Not lexical, but scoped to the enclosing `route` block

[22:06] <jnthnwrthngtn> But you can always use `include route { ... }` to get yourself an inner route scope and use it immediately

[22:19] <Xliff> So my above example would work with an inner route block enclosing that first get?

[23:20] <jnthnwrthngtn> Should do, yes; getting template location and resource scoping right is why the router plugin mechanism was created.
