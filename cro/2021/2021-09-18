[17:49] <lizmat> Hmmm... on a clean Rakudo HEAD, Cro::HTTP seems to not test very well

[17:49] <lizmat> and if installed with --force, attempting to load it bombs with This representation (Uninstantiable) does not support elems (for type TValue)

[17:53] <lizmat> guess I'm going to restart from a fresh rakudo clone

[19:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> Sounds like a Rakudo regression

[19:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hopefully one that didn't make it into the release

[19:12] <lizmat> well, I'm about to give up for today

[19:12] <lizmat> I'm on the release, and nothing works anymore  :-(

[19:13] <lizmat> apart from test and spectest

[19:13] <lizmat> but anything todo with OO::Monitors   meh

[19:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> Cro::HTTP looks OK on head of new-disp, fwiw

[19:14] <jnthnwrthngtn> (tried it 'cus it's what I have around)

[19:15] <lizmat> so what should I do?

[19:15] <lizmat> I guess I'll start with a fresh rakudo checkout + a nuked ~/.zef and nuke any .precomp dirs I can find

[19:15] <jnthnwrthngtn> No idea. See if anybody else can repro the issue?

[19:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, worth a try, although maybe keep the .precomp around in case anybody wants to diagnose how it broke; it's not meant to

[19:16] <jnthnwrthngtn> walk, bbl

[19:18] <lizmat> too late, nuked about 5G worth of .precomp dirs

[19:24] <japhb> Wow, that's a lot of .precomp

[19:24] <japhb> I'll try a full build on my box, see how that fares

[19:25] <japhb> ... and away it goes

[19:33] <lizmat> ok: did the following:

[19:33] <lizmat> nuked all .precomp dirs

[19:33] <lizmat> nuked ~/.zef

[19:33] <japhb> OO::Monitors has installed successfully, so I'll see if the things that depend on it also succeed

[19:33] <lizmat> git a clean rakudo checkout

[19:34] <lizmat> installed zef

[19:34] <lizmat> installed OO::Monitors

[19:34] <lizmat> (ok)

[19:34] <lizmat> installed Inline::Perl5 as recommended by 'make spectest' 

[19:34] <lizmat> (ok)

[19:35] <lizmat> zef install Cro::HTTP

[19:35] <lizmat> [Cro::HTTP] ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /Users/liz/.zef/tmp/cro-http-0.8.6.tar.gz/cro-http-0.8.6/t/http-auth-basic-with-session.t

[19:36] <japhb> That's really weird.

[19:36] <japhb> My build didn't quite make it that far:

[19:36] <japhb> ===> Testing: OpenSSL:ver<0.1.26>

[19:36] <japhb> # NETWORK_TESTING was not set

[19:36] <japhb> Unable to read key in method new at /home/geoff/.zef/tmp/openssl.git/1e0f472094f3544bde39a15d6fa7cf809324967a/lib/OpenSSL/RSATools.pm6 (OpenSSL::RSATools) line 23 in block <unit> at t/03-rsa.t line 10

[19:37] * japhb will try again and see if it persists

[19:39] <lizmat> did zef install Cro::HTTP --serial

[19:39] <lizmat> (same fail)

[19:39] <lizmat> did zef install Cro::HTTP --serial again (but now all dependencies have been installed already)

[19:39] <lizmat> (same fail)

[19:41] <japhb> Where are you installing to?

[19:43] * japhb watches all his CPU cores flashing red in atop and being clocked back as the fans go wild

[19:44] *** xinming left
[19:44] *** xinming joined
[19:44] <lizmat> not installing to anything particularly

[19:44] <lizmat> zef install Cro::HTTP

[19:45] <lizmat> that's it, verbatim

[19:45] <lizmat> all dependencies already installed in a previous 'zef install Cro::HTTP --serial' run

[19:46] <japhb> No, I meant, where are you installing Rakudo?

[19:46] <lizmat> I don't understand how the dependency can be incorrect, as that NQPHLL.nqp is brand new, created when I built rakudo

[19:47] <lizmat> ~/Github/rakudo.moar is the dir with the repo, it gets installed in its "install" dir ?

[19:47] <japhb> I guess that was my question.  I was trying to see if you were installing it somewhere outside the build tree.

[19:47] <japhb> (In which case said location might have had old files or so.)

[19:47] <lizmat> nope, trying to KISS

[19:48] <japhb> Dang, OpenSSL failure is repeatable

[19:49] <japhb> What happens when you try to install OpenSSL?  I'm curious if this one is just me, or it's repeatable as well

[19:49] <lizmat> that was already installed fine with the prereqs of Cro::HTTP

[19:50] <japhb> (or IO::Socket::SSL, which depends on it)

[19:50] <japhb> Damn, so I can't get my system into the same state as yours.  :-(

[19:50] <lizmat> installs fine

[19:51] <japhb> Gerbleflrpl

[19:53] * japhb tries a full build on rakudo-moar-2021.08-27-g10b327292, the last Rakudo before the release process

[19:53] <lizmat> same problem for Pod::To::HTML, which also depends on OO::Monitors

[19:54] <lizmat> so it really looks like any module depending on OO::Monitors, will fail 

[19:54] <lizmat> which means I cannot have App::Mi6

[19:54] <lizmat> which means I cannot do any module uploads

[19:57] <lizmat> ok,. I cloned OO-Monitors repo, did a `zef install . --force`

[19:58] <lizmat> and now all begins to work

[19:58] <lizmat> I had to do the --force because it was already installed

[19:58] <japhb> ???

[19:58] <lizmat> yeah, beats me

[19:59] <lizmat> guess I'll keep that in mind for the next time

[20:05] *** TempIRCLogger left
[20:05] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[20:06] *** TempIRCLogger left
[20:07] *** TempIRCLogger joined
[20:26] <lizmat> after I awaited $resp.body on a HTTP::Client.get, should I do something else before I can use the same HTTP::Client object again?

[20:27] <lizmat> I keep getting Died with the exception:

[20:27] <lizmat>     Header table index 75 out of range

[20:27] <lizmat>       in method resolve-decoded-index 

[20:27] <lizmat> from HTTP::HPACK

[20:28] <lizmat> hmm... it appears to related to https:// URLs vs http:// URLs

[21:21] <japhb> OK, pretty sure the OpenSSL test failure I'm seeing is independent of Rakudo version (I've tried several builds, working back *past* the most recent successful build I had).

[21:21] <japhb> I'm going to mark that one --/test and try again to see if I can reach the problems you had.

[22:03] <japhb> After marking OpenSSL --/test, everything installed fine on rakudo-moar-2021.09-1-g28303d0c6, including all the Cro modules.
