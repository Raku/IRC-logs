[10:46] <lizmat> isn't this legal in Cro::WebApp:  ??   

[10:46] <lizmat> <?{ $c.starts-with("-") }>

[10:47] <lizmat> or: <?{ $c.starts-with('-') }>

[10:47] <lizmat> ??

[10:55] <lizmat> fails with: malformed expression at line 209 near '("-") }>

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> lizmat: I think we only recently started to allow method calls to args, and I can't remember if that already made it into the last release or if it'll be in the next one

[10:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> Just checked, it's for the next one

[10:56] <lizmat> ok,  but something like:

[10:56] <lizmat> <?{ .channel && .channel ne $c }>

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/commit/e92617ea6b9de37b6c4047a21fef998b8cc5d58e

[10:56] <lizmat> alread works

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> Sure

[10:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> I think we've parsed those kind of expressions from the start

[10:56] <lizmat> so if I mixin a method that doesn't take any args, it should be fine?

[10:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes, that'd be one workaround :)

[10:57] <lizmat> ok

[10:57] <jnthnwrthngtn> We should do another release relatively soon (I hope this month) so you can drop it in not too long :)

[10:57] <lizmat> well, I hope to release the beta of the log server during the weekend  :-)

[10:58] <jnthnwrthngtn> :)

[11:52] <JRaspass> Friendly reminder: I'd love a review of https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/pull/50 at some point which uses that call subs with args feature of templates

[20:26] <lizmat> BTW, will the next release of Cro allow for sending an existing file .gzipped "as is" ?

[20:50] <lizmat> is there an overview of to be expected features in the next version of Cro ?
