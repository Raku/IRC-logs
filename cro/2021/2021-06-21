[21:31] <japhb> Attempting to install cro from HEAD (directly using github URLs) is failing tests for me: t/tools-crofile.t (1 failing test) and t/tools-link-editor.t (4 failing tests)

[21:31] <japhb> That's also building on Rakudo HEAD

[21:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hm, I'm not sure if anything much changed there recently, and wonder if that's a Rakudo regression

[22:24] <japhb> Hmmm, let me try building explicitly against 2021.06

[22:24] * japhb starts running a full build at that Rakudo release.

[23:34] <japhb> Same failure on 2021.06 Rakudo

[23:35] <japhb> It worked when I built everything back on May 29 (rakudo-moar-2021.05-3-g39e5834dc), but I hadn't built anything in between.

[23:35] <japhb> I'll see if I can bisect at all.
