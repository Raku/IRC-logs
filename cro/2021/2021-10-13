[11:20] <Xliff> \o #cro

[11:21] <Xliff> Can't seem to get Cro::LDAP installed. Tests are throwing odd errors.

[11:23] <Altai-man> Xliff,hmm, let's see...

[11:23] <Xliff> Errors posted in this gist: https://gist.github.com/Xliff/211e9170a3a22231edc05cd82b58c28a

[11:24] <Xliff> Note how some tests expect the reverse of the tested result.

[11:24] <Altai-man> Xliff, rakudo version?

[11:24] <Xliff> Welcome to Rakudoâ„¢ v2021.09-251-gff6951f59.

[11:25] <Xliff> Altai-man, do you like long relaxing Ambient music?

[11:25] <Xliff> https://symphocat.bandcamp.com/album/harpa-album

[11:26] <Xliff> Tracks 2 & 3 are  the standouts.

[11:26] <Altai-man> Xliff, is it somehow related to my cro-ldap issue? :)

[11:26] * Altai-man investigates

[11:26] <Xliff> No, but it might put you in the mood to solve it!

[11:26] <Xliff> :)

[11:43] <Altai-man> Xliff, the first one is related to OpenSSL, no idea how to fix that, hmm. The second one is something fishy happening in the client, I'll try to take a look when I have time after $commajob.

[11:59] <Altai-man> and the another one seems like a rakudo regression maybe

[13:23] *** Xliff_ joined
[13:27] <Xliff_> Altai-man, think you can fix these today?

[13:30] <Altai-man> Xliff_, is there an urgency? The best thing I can do is to suggest skipping those tests and using release rakudo maybe.

[13:37] <Altai-man> Or, rather "the fastest thing I can do".

[13:54] <Altai-man> Xliff_, trying to golf the regression

[17:27] <Xliff> history

[17:28] <Xliff> Oops.
