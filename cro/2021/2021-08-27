[12:33] <lizmat> how can I use the <&HTML("foo")> functionality as a parameter to another sub?

[12:34] <lizmat> <&foo(HTML("foo bar"))> doesn't seem to work ?

[12:34] <jnthnwrthngtn> You can't

[12:34] <lizmat> ok, maybe I should rephrase the question

[12:35] <lizmat> how do I pass a string with HTML that I do not want to have escaped, to a :sub 

[12:35] <lizmat> ?

[12:35] <jnthnwrthngtn> Just pass it; the escaping doesn't happen at the sub passing boundary, it happens at the point the value is output.

[12:36] <jnthnwrthngtn> e.g. with <$foo> or <.foo>

[12:38] <lizmat> but I do *not* want it escaped

[12:39] <lizmat> example of a tooltip: <&messages-input('User', 'ByNick', 'Filter on nick', 'Only show messages that are <em>not</em> written')>

[12:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Then in sub messages-input you would use <&HTML($param-name-of-final-argument)>

[12:42] <lizmat> that's what I thought, but alas, no go  :-(

[12:43] * lizmat inspects the HTML source

[12:43] <jnthnwrthngtn> Really? I'm surprised; I'm sure I've done a similar structure multiple times before

[12:44] <lizmat> Ah, it renders as:

[12:44] <lizmat> <div title="Only show messages that are <em>not</em> written

[12:44] <lizmat> so I guess it's the JS library that does this, taking it literally  :-(

[12:46] <jnthnwrthngtn> Looks like, although I'm not sure embedding bits of HTML inside of attributes is commonly done

[12:46] <lizmat> yeah, I guess

[12:46] <jnthnwrthngtn> But annoying if you wanted that :)

[12:47] <lizmat> I guess it will be NOT rather than <em>not</em> then
