[00:04] <japhb> Ah, sounds like I misunderstood you.  I thought you were wanting to look at the blessed container on the Perl side.  But from what you just said I'm guessing you're trying to pull away the abstractions and look at the actual data structures that Inline::Perl5 uses to represent a Perl object?

[00:21] <Xliff> No. I want the underlying P5 data, but don't know if Perl5 is the best place to ask. Inline::Perl5 contains the wrapped Perl5 object POINTER.

[00:22] <Xliff> I don't know if many people on #perl5 will know that.

[03:10] <japhb> Oh, I wasn't suggesting asking #perl5 -- I was suggesting asking perl5 *the binary*.  Meaning, write some Perl code that could do the introspection, stick it in a Perl sub, and then call *that* from Raku via Inline::Perl5.

[03:22] <Xliff> OIC

[03:23] <Xliff> Might not be a bad idea. japhb++

[03:29] <japhb> Now I've got a question, on a separate topic ...

[03:29] <japhb> (For context, I'm thinking about https://cro.services/docs/intro/http-server)

[03:30] <japhb> My question is: what's the best way to bind to more than one interface with the "same" Cro service?

[03:31] <japhb> Should I take the same $application generated by the route {} block and feed it to two separate Cro::HTTP::Server instances?

[03:31] <japhb> Should I use two separate $application instances as well, but have them both do all their work via a shared (thread-safe) object?

[03:37] <japhb> I guess I'm assuming that Cro doesn't natively support multi-binding, but I don't see an easy way to do that.  Seems like it could be made as an alternate TCP packet source, feeding into a shared Supply pipeline used by the rest of the Cro stack ....

[04:06] <Xliff> I would suggest the first, purely from a maintenance standpoint.
