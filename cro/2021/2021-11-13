[15:24] <Xliff> I am currently working on a program that needs to pull a type off of an attribute. However, when I do so I am getting a "MyType(Any)" rather than a "MyType" 

[15:25] <Xliff> How can I get rid of the "(Any)"?

[17:32] <lizmat> don't use a coercion type ?

[17:32] <lizmat> Xliff ^^

[18:32] <SmokeMachine> m: say Int().^target_type.^name
