[10:25] <lizmat> is there a simple Cro way to find out the current servers name / protocol being used, to be able to create a full URL referring to a page on the current website?

[10:26] <lizmat> yes, I know I can use relative URL's, but if you want to make a function to copy a link to the clipboard, you need the whole thing

[10:44] <sena_kun> lizmat, in a route handler?

[10:45] <lizmat> well, when setting up a hash for a template to be rendered...

[11:04] <sena_kun> lizmat, you can check `Location` header maybe?

[11:04] <sena_kun> erm, `Host` that is.

[11:05] <lizmat> hmmm...

[11:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> sena_kun: I'm guessing we somehow solve this in the link production PR that still needs finishing?

[11:29] <sena_kun> jnthnwrthngtn, I don't remember if it handles host/protocol bits, but partially.

[18:57] <Xliff> Hello. I'd like to compile a Cro::WebApp::Template into another Cro::WebApp::Template and then use the last one. What's the best way to go about doing that?

[18:58] <Xliff> So ... .crotmp -> .crotmp -> html

[19:41] <Xliff> OK, better yet... what's the best way to "compile" a  a Cro::WebApp::Template from a scalar?

[20:17] <japhb> Xliff: I think the Cro team was working on being able to make an abstract template repo that you could fill as desired.  Don't remember exactly what it was called, but maybe check the #cro logs?

[20:18] <Xliff> japhb: Thanks for the info. I think I have what I need in Cro::
