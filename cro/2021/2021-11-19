[00:07] <patrickb> I have just successfully uploaded a file to OBS using Cro. :-)

[00:08] <patrickb> I'm just not entirely sure my fix is correct. Will do a PR so people can give their opinion.

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: patrickbkr++ created pull request #160: Do not send the ENO_OF_STREAM flag twice

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/160

[00:28] <patrickb> It's a bit ironic that I first  implemented remote window handling and only afterwards noticed this actually a lot more obvious protocol violation.

[00:31] * japhb glares in the general direction of `$MAX-FRAME-SIZE-9` -- that's just confusing.

[00:42] *** patrickb left

[00:51] <patrickz> that's the frame header 3 bytes length + 1 byte type + 1 byte flags + 4 bytes stream id

[00:52] <patrickz> but yeah, could be made more obvious...

[00:56] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: patrickbkr++ created pull request #161: Implement remote window handling

[00:56] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/161

[01:19] <japhb> patrickz: I meant because it's not clear that `$MAX-FRAME-SIZE-9` will actually be parsed as `$MAX-FRAME-SIZE - 9`, but yeah, having `my $FRAME-OVERHEAD = 9;  # frame header 3 bytes length + 1 byte type + 1 byte flags + 4 bytes stream id` followed by using `$MAX-FRAME-SIZE - $FRAME-OVERHEAD` is probably even better

[01:20] <patrickz> Ah! I didn't see that other reading!

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Do not send the ENO_OF_STREAM flag twice

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: The FrameSerializer must only mark the last partial frame as END_OF_STREAM

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: if the original non-split frame contained that flag.

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: This caused the marker to be sent twice if the conditions were right and

[17:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: results in the remote end (rightfully) aborting the connection.
