[12:51] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Since it is not the $value that needs comparison in the case when a Pair is used but the $key, since that is the value returned to the server.

[13:01] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn -- \o

[13:01] <Xliff> Just discovered that the datetime-local control doesn't like the "Z" on the end of its values

[13:01] <Xliff> So another PR is coming, as soon as I can get a break from $dayJob

[13:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> OK, thanks

[15:25] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Xliff++ created pull request #54: datetime-local form element does not like values ending in 'Z'

[22:29] <japhb> It doesn't look like Log::Timeline is integrated in cro-websocket ("Timeline" references are all over in cro-http, but not a single one in cro-websocket).  Is this just NYI, or avoided for a reason?

[23:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: NYI, although I think there's either a PR or a branch with some initial work on it 

[23:24] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: OK, interesting, I'll look for that

[23:27] <japhb> Ah, looks like vendethiel did https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/compare/log-timeline-probes
