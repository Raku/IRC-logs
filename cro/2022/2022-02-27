[15:57] <tbrowder> an important question for the cro app: what user should run it? the apache or nginx daemon user? or some other user?

[15:59] <sena_kun> tbrowder, it depends on what are your policies... Do you just proxy requests through nginx/apache/whatever and the app is not visible from the outside?

[15:59] <sena_kun> then whatever works for you

[16:03] <tbrowder> correct, the app should not be visible outside afaik.

[16:03] <tbrowder> sena_kun: thnx
