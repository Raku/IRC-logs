[10:10] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: Hey there! I hope things are going well with you.

[10:10] <Xliff> What would be the best way to introspect the defined routes.

[10:11] <Xliff> If defined, what would be the best way to turn them off?

[10:43] *** Xliff left

[13:39] <Xliff> OK, so a routes() sub returns a Cro::HTTP::Router::RouteSet class, which has @.handlers.

[13:40] <Xliff> That has a .implementation, which I guess could be wrapped to execute not-found() if I want them off.

[13:40] <Xliff> If I want to turn them back off, they can be .unwrap 'd

[13:40] <Xliff> That sound about right?

[16:04] <lizmat> does this ring a bell:

[16:04] <lizmat> Failed to resolve host name 'www.cpan.org' with family 0

[16:05] <lizmat> Error: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

[16:05] <lizmat> in Cro::TCP line 106

[16:05] <lizmat> this is on MacOS Mojave

[16:05] <lizmat> works fine on my own MacOS Mojave, but not on the other machine

[16:38] <Xliff> Wish I could help, but my Mac Mini is currently out of operation.

[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Xliff: That's barely API, tbh. Why don't you just use `around` and have it check a flag somewhere?

[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> And then give not-found if the flag is set, and call the original route otherwise

[16:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> Or do it with `before` middleware or something

[16:43] <Xliff> jnthnwrthngtn: That was also a thought, yes.

[16:43] <Xliff> Still need to write up the mechanism that links signature to UI element to handle this.

[16:43] <Xliff> Also, I was doing this in preparation of allowing a user to reload a route.

[16:44] <Xliff> AKA in case of uninstall/install for code changes.

[16:44] <Xliff> Yes, it's definitely better to restart the server for stability, but some people like that kinda thing.

[16:44] <Xliff> Many expect it.

[18:52] <Xliff> Hmmm... crafter an activate/deactivate mechanism at the Cro::HTTP::Router::RouteSet level

[18:52] <Xliff> Works nice.
