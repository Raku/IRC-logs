[18:05] <sena_kun> jdv, what's your version of zeromq library?

[18:10] <lizmat> BTW, isn't Cro up to version 0.8.7 ?

[18:13] <lizmat> hmmm.. trying on my Debian box: "Cannot determine the brand of your make utility."   meh

[18:14] <lizmat> ah, apparently I need to install make first  :-)

[18:41] <lizmat> sena_kun: looks like the Cro::ZeroMQ::Socket::XPub module is **NOT** in the META6.json of Cro::ZeroMQ

[18:48] <lizmat> https://github.com/croservices/cro-zeromq/pull/4

[18:55] <jdv> sena_kun: looks like 4.3.4-1

[18:55] <jdv> which i believe is "current" for debian 11

[18:56] <jdv> ah, meta.  thanks.
