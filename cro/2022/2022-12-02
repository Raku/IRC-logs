[15:13] <patrickb> o/ I have some more time to debug the Cro Client HTTP2 header timeout errors.

[15:15] <patrickb> I now know that it's the Settings frame that the FrameSerializer tries to send during setup of the pipeline that is stuck. The packet never hits the wire.

[15:43] <patrickb> Even further it seems that the `emit` of the Settings frame never reaches the TLS Connector. (Interesting: A few lines up the FrameSerializer emits the magic string, that goes through and is also visible in wireshark.)

[20:54] <patrickb> I start to suspect this is a supply / whenever deadlock triggered by some unlucky timing.
