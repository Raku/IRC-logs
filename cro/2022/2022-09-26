[18:34] <[Coke]> having trouble installing Cro::HTTP - it's hanging after showing: [Cro::HTTP] t/http-session-persistent.t ....... ok

[18:34] <[Coke]> (linux box)

[18:40] <[Coke]> I have now installed all the deps by hand so I can go faster trying to do the install here since I've had to do it several times.

[21:09] <[Coke]> ... came back to see that the install completed the final time on the azure linux box. "having to install x times until it works" is not a great feel.

[21:10] <[Coke]> if I get more details, I'll share them.
