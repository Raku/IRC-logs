[02:37] <Xliff> How can I access a hash with a key that is stored in a given variable from within a template?

[02:37] <Xliff> This is actually pretty basic stuff that is not in the documentation.

[02:38] <Xliff> Trying to set the hash and the key into a variable so that the format is $h{$k} will not work. The template throws an error.

[02:38] <Xliff> Likewise .hash.key, and .hash.$key

[02:38] <Xliff> Please advise.

[09:11] <jnthn> Xliff: The docs state: "<.{$key}> can be used to do indirect hash indexing", and since that's a deref and any deref chould be parsed after a variable too, <$foo{$bar}> (or maybe <$foo.{$bar}>) should do it

[09:13] <jnthn> The docs also cover defaults: https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template#Subroutines

[13:04] <Xliff> jnthn: Thank you for that. Must have missed it. After working all night, I finally got something working.

[13:05] <Xliff> jnthn: Turns out the problem wasn't hash access, but trying to access a Nil value.

[13:05] <Xliff> With appropriate guards in place, things worked.

[13:10] <jnthn> Ah, good you got it working

[13:12] <Xliff> jnthn: So I've noticed that for Cro::WebApp::Bootstrap::Template, your forms can only take on the attributes of the class being edited. 

[13:13] <Xliff> I've made some minor changes so that you can add supplementary elements to it.

[13:14] <jnthn> I'm not sure if I ever really finished/released that module :)

[13:15] <Xliff> Ah, got it.

[13:15] <jnthn> But please do send the PR. Only thing is that by now bootstrap 5 is out so I dunno if I should just do it using that :)

[13:15] <Xliff> OK.

[13:16] <Xliff> One other thing, the forms have a tendency to submit when hitting enter. This kills things like having javascript prefill in <input> entries with auto calculations based on other fields.

[13:17] <Xliff> I had to resort to javascript to stop that behavior.

[13:20] <Xliff> jnthn: Did you get this bit? https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/commit/baf64ccbd5687259a858b1ce75e751950d60f11e

[13:21] <jnthn> Hm, it says it's not on any branch, so dunno. But it looks familiar...

[13:21] <jnthn> Will check later

[13:21] <Xliff> OK. Thanks for the help.

[13:36] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Xliff++ created pull request #75: Adds the ability to add supplementary markup to the form

[13:36] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/pull/75

[13:37] <Xliff> jnthn: There you go.
