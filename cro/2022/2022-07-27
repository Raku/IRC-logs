[02:01] <Xliff> jnthn: Have you ever thought of the posibility of programmatically adding routes to a Cro router?

[02:01] <Xliff> jnthn: (I know you are probably in bed, now. Hope for a lively discussion on this whenever you have the time)

[03:32] <Xliff> jnthn: Actually using a slurpy hash worked a treat!

[09:48] <jnthn> Xliff: That's kinda what https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-openapi-routesfromdefinition does

[09:49] <jnthn> See https://github.com/croservices/cro-openapi-routes-from-definition for the implementation

[11:17] <Xliff> jnthn: Oh, yes. You did mention that to me. I hadn't had a chance to look.

[11:17] <Xliff> Thanks for the suggestion!

[11:18] <Xliff> So, I have a basic application server I'm writing for $dayJob 

[11:18] <Xliff> It's turning out, nicely.

[11:18] <Xliff> It's Cro-based.

[11:25] <jnthn> Cool :)

[11:26] <jnthn> Basically the Cro router deals in Raku signatures, so the current constraint is that you have to produce one of those. Given RakuAST will make that easier than today, and it's possible today anyway, then I think that's probably fine.

[11:31] <Xliff> Yep. I've been really familiarizing myself with signatures.

[11:32] <Xliff> jnthn: Do you think that RakuAST will help with creating usable function pointer types for NativeCall?

[11:32] <Xliff> I really would like to simplify my other projects and that's one of the big issues remaining.

[20:48] <jdv> i'm seeing cro::zeromq tests instability

[20:48] <jdv> anyone else see that?
