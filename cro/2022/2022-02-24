[00:00] <tbrowder> actual error is failed to make connection with backend

[00:05] <japhb> tbrowder: Which interface is Cro listening on?  And which IP are you using to talk to it?  Do they match?  :-)

[01:24] *** Xliff left
[01:47] <tbrowder> cro is listening to localhost, port 10000

[01:54] <tbrowder> cro is running on a remote server reached via an IP derived from a dns lookup on the domain gbumc.church. the reverse proxy uses the domain name plus the port 10000

[02:14] <japhb> tbrowder: That may not work because localhost is only advertised on the loopback network -- which is not where DNS IPs will appear.

[02:15] <japhb> Which is to say, you may be routing the packets to the wrong interface

[02:15] <tbrowder> ok, so i'll try listening on the real ip then. thnx

[02:15] <japhb> np, good luck

[02:16] <tbrowder> thank you.

[11:48] <tbrowder> .tell japhb  \o/ touchdown!! yaaay THANKS

[11:50] <tbrowder> still sorting out the pieces, but my cro app is working. now i need to get systemd to handle the cro app start.

[13:32] <tbrowder> and aslo figure out how to actually duplicate the path info from my original home page into serving it from the cro app...

[13:57] <tbrowder> i'm trying to use the static route but i don't understand what cro router thinks it base directory for '/' is. i tried using "static './index.shtml'" but that didn't work.

[13:58] <tbrowder> is it confused by the suffix '.shtml'?

[13:58] <tbrowder> back later...

[13:59] <tbrowder> oh, i can slurp that file and serve it as a string but it loses some images in subdirs in the process.

[14:00] <tbrowder> bye

[14:09] <japhb> tbrowder: Glad to hear you got the basic app working.  :-)

[15:10] <tbrowder> yep, a happy "event"!

[15:26] <tbrowder> i think i see the static file problem: .shtml is NOT in apache's mime types so a module and directive can probably take care of that

[15:32] <tbrowder> oops, that is already in my conf files, so that may not be the exact answer...

[17:54] <tbrowder> i couldn't get the alternative static signature work. right now my solution is to rename index.shtml to index.html and it served, barely. none of the img links worked. do i have to go the full cro template route for that?

[17:54] <tbrowder> s/signature work/signature to work/
