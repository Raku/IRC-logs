[18:42] <melezhik> Hi

[18:42] <melezhik> how can I add http basic auth for all cro routes?

[18:42] <melezhik> if there is a simple/stanard way to do that?

[18:45] <melezhik> found this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53062118/basic-authentication-in-perl6-with-cro

[18:46] <melezhik> I wonder if anything has changed since that time ...

[18:49] <melezhik> reading this as well - https://cro.services/docs/http-auth-and-sessions
