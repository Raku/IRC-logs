[14:10] <kawaii_> Hello! I've noticed quite a few entries like this in my program which I believe are a result of Internet crawlers/spiders and such sending data my API doesn't really understand (L30 is `whenever $request.body -> %body`), and whilst they aren't harmful to my program is there some way to prevent these from appearing in my log? Or do I need to add some extra filtering in my code? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/1iGjYqc7/

[14:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Probably you need to validate the content-type of the request or some such before accessing the body
