[12:59] <Altreus> I believe that I am correctly closing my websocket and it is doing so with the code 1000; however, the bot should go offline immediately, but it doesn't. Any pointers on how to debug that? https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/blob/disconnect-on-destroy/lib/API/Discord/WebSocket.rakumod#L167

[13:00] <Altreus> Ultimately called from here https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/blob/disconnect-on-destroy/lib/API/Discord.rakumod#L187

[13:00] <Altreus> It does take a noticeable amount of time to exit, where previously it did not, so *something* is happening

[13:01] <Altreus> But all I have from trace is this (note location of ^C) https://gist.github.com/Altreus/410d80bf8c591e3ea5fa94ed7123d2f0

[13:01] <Altreus> I don't know how to interpret that :)
