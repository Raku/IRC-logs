[15:07] <lizmat> there's no #comma channel, so here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/syorsy/comma_plugin_for_intellij_idea_doesnt_see_my/   :-)

[15:12] <Altai-man> alas, /me doesn't have a reddit account

[15:12] <Altai-man> but it's that type of an issue where it's hard to help without be

[15:14] <japhb> "without be"?

[15:14] <Altai-man> *getting some more details, like how the project was created... My first bet is to ensure the `lib` directory is marked as sources (the icon in the project view will be blue), right click context menu has an "Mark the directory as sources/tests/whatever" item.

[15:14] <japhb> Ah

[15:15] * Altai-man is in another office now and has a Swedish keyboard he is not used to

[15:15] <Altai-man> one can claim this keyboard is without... be. :)

[15:16] <japhb> Annoyingly, when I added a Swedish input method to my system, the US input suddenly forgot about the `/~ key.  I can only enter those characters in Swedish mode now.

[15:20] <Altai-man> the touch response is cool, has some "mechanic" feel in it, which is unusual compared to the torpe keys, but "Win" and "Alt" are swapped (the first is very important in my window manager, the second is used often in emacs...) is a bit unusual. plus smaller enter gets you surprises

[20:59] <tbrowder> question on Cro::HTTP::Server  : for the :host named parameter, is an apache virtual host name acceptable as a value?

[22:54] <lizmat> tbrowder: would that resolve to the correct IP ?
