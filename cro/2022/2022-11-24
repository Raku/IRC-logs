[19:53] <patrickb> o/

[19:54] <patrickb> I'm still hunting the cro bug of sometimes not sending a request and thus hitting the header timeout.

[19:55] <patrickb> What I have found out: - It's not reproducible. Sometimes it happens on the very first connection attempt, sometimes on a later reconnect.

[19:57] <patrickb> - The HTTP2 connection is successfully established (packets on the wire are fine, cro trace shows the setup happening), but in the failure case the `emit` on the request pipeline never reaches the HTTP2::RequestSerializer.

[20:02] <patrickb> - It only happens with HTTP2. I can't reproduce it with HTTP1.

[20:04] <patrickb> - I the test script is as minimal as a Cro::Client example program can be: https://gist.github.com/patrickbkr/637e1e4bc9babe37346569173dabc5f3

[20:05] <patrickb> I'm starting to wonder if this even is a bug in Cro or Rakudo core.

[20:07] <patrickb> From all I can see in the code the HTTP2::RequestSerializer should be the thing directly listening at the other end of the supplier used in Cro::Client HTTP2 request supplier.

[20:08] <patrickb> Is there a simple way to introspect the listeners of a given supplier?

[20:09] <patrickb> I'll ask that last question over on #raku

[20:41] <patrickb> OK. I have sprinkled some debug prints around. The consumer directly attached to the supply in the Cro::Client HTTP2 request pipeline is the SerializerExtension. As I suspected. The `emit` does not reach the code in the `whenever` in the error case.

[20:42] <patrickb> It seems that this is a problem with rakudo itself and not Cro. I wonder which components are necessary to trigger this as under normal circumstances supplies are super stable.

[20:42] <patrickb> I suspect and fear it's a bug in the VM itself.

[20:42] * patrickb tries to trigger it without the JIT

[20:47] <patrickb> Also happens with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1. Phew!

[20:54] <patrickb> Verified on 2021.12 and 2022.07
