[14:32] <jdv> can anyone help figure out this cro rakudo regression?

[14:34] <lizmat> jdv: sorry, I'm pretty useless in that area  :-(

[14:56] <jnthnwrthngtn> jdv: I'm a bit tied up, but: which tests fail? And does IO::Socket::Async::SSL pass, because Cro::TLS is really a very thing wrapper around that?

[14:59] <jdv> does not IO::Socket::Async::SSL pass its "alpn" tests

[15:00] <jdv> and the failing cro::tls test has "alpn" in it

[15:00] <jdv> its beyond me to triage much more i'm afraid

[15:02] <jdv> whoa.  ordering fail.  more like "IO::Socket::Async::SSL does not pass its "alpn" tests"

[15:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oh, well if IO::Socket::Async::SSL is failing its ALPN tests, that's the problem that needs looking at; fix that and Cro::TLS will be almost certainly be fine

[15:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm confused how neither of these were caught by blin and blocked the release.

[15:04] <jdv> well at least my theory is more confirmed.  i am also a bit peeved about that - made a note to look into it later.

[15:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> It may be about stricter unsinged rules and that we can patch the module

[15:05] <jnthnwrthngtn> uh, unsigned

[15:05] <jdv> ah.  maybe i'll see if i can raise nine then.
