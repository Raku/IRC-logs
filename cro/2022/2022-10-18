[20:20] <jnthn> OK, 0.8.8 shippped, and is the first Cro release on the zef ecosystem :)

[20:25] <jnthn> ...and something has bit-rotted and so the image for the Cro website won't build

[20:37] <jnthn> Ah, there we go. https://cro.services/docs/releases

[20:58] <jnthn> Ah, and nice thing about the zef ecosystem is much faster updates when there are new releases. So...a new round of Cro Docker base images is pushed also.

[20:58] <jnthn> Used to have to wait hours to do that.

[21:06] <Xliff> Did you update the template docs?

[21:10] <jnthn> Yes.

[21:10] <jnthn> There's now 4 separate docs too, since it was getting a bit much for one, and a bit annoying to navigate

[21:11] <jnthn> So in the syntax one at https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template-syntax there's now a nice navigation thingy to the various aspects of the langauge

[21:13] <jnthn> And, a tweet from the Cro account. That's everything, I think :)

[22:04] * japhb rebuilds at Rakudo HEAD to make sure 0.8.8 works well with bleading edge

[22:08] * JRaspass bumps Raku Land to 0.8.8, time to simplify some template logic :-)

[23:02] <japhb> Success, BTW -- 0.8.8 seems happy with Rakudo HEAD

[23:22] <jnthn> \o/

[23:23] <jnthn> Thanks for testing :)

[23:36] <JRaspass> I really like that the structured tag syntax keeps the indentation consistent with the rest of the not conditional tags
