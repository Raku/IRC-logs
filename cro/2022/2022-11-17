[19:01] <lizmat> I assume this is a known issue?

[19:01] <lizmat> [Cro::TLS] # Failed test 'Listening for connections once the Supply is tapped'

[19:01] <lizmat> [Cro::TLS] # at t/tls.t line 39

[19:01] <lizmat> [Cro::TLS] # Server certificate verification failed: certificate has expired

[19:03] <japhb> lizmat: There was a cert update a few days ago, commit aa5a1113ab (merged in 7cc1482738).  No release since then that I can see. 

[19:07] <lizmat> Cro::HTTP also doesn't install without --/force-test  :-(
