[09:03] <jnthn> .tell Xliff Probably the best way - if wanting to plug into the router - is to provide a role that implements Cro::Transform from HTTP request to HTTP response, maps requests to the correct method, and then use it as `delegate 'foo', ThatObject.new`

[09:04] <jnthn> ah, delegate is probably taking a pair, so `delegate foo => ThatObject.new;`

[09:38] <jnthn> Ah, though if you meant that you want to just subscribe methods to the `get`/`post` calls, then you can do it using `assuming`

[09:39] <jnthn> (and assume the invocant)

[09:39] <jnthn> Then the router will see the method sans invocant and stuff should work out

[09:40] <jnthn> `get TheClass.^lookup('get').assuming($an-instance);` or similar

[12:15] <jnthn> Xliff: Your "cleaned up considerably with class methods" looks hugely clutterred and repetitive to me.

[12:16] <jnthn> But of course no objections to putting the code to make that kinda thing happen into a module :)

[12:27] <Xliff> jnthn: Was thinking a Role, to be honest. Still...would like to know how to get there. The hygiene comes from not needing an explicit route block, as that will be autogenerated from self.^methods.

[12:28] <Xliff> Which has the benefit of being MUCH cleaner when the number of routes scales upward.

[12:28] <Xliff> If you think it does look "hugely cluttered and repetitive", I would love to hear your suggestions for cleaning it up!  :)

[12:44] <jnthn> Xliff: I structured larger apps by having route blocks spread over a number of different functions/modules and composing them with `include`/`delegate`.

[12:47] <Xliff> Yes, I've been using that strategy as well. Still, sometimes it's nice to keep logically similar routes in the same place. This can make route blocks kinda cumbersome. I only offered another way to arrange them. I expect Cro-users will adopt a wide variety of strategies.

[12:47] <Xliff> I'm only trying to develop another one.,

[13:22] <jnthn> Sure; I think you already have all the pieces to get there, though, between the MOP, `.assuming`, etc. and can package something up as a module?

[13:45] <Xliff> Yep! I think I can package it up as a role. I just need the time to do some testing.

[13:45] <Xliff> And I don't have that ATM because I am doing much of this for $dayJob and I just got pulled off on another tangent. :/

[13:57] <jnthn> Sigh, know the feeling, I had a 2 week vacation, and only just now have I dug myself out of the backlog of meetings/emails/discussions induced by it.

[13:57] <jnthn> (Whereby I started on Monday. So 4 days just to catch up...)

[13:58] <jnthn> Now I need another vacation to recover from it :P

[14:11] <Xliff> Hahahaha!

[14:12] <Xliff> (not to laugh at your pain, but.... I know the feeling!)

[14:12] <Xliff> More often than not, my frustrations result in finding out more requirements for a project just when I'm about to deliver it!

[14:12] <Xliff> My company doesn't believe in specs.

[14:13] <Xliff> (halp!)

[14:15] <lizmat> if your company does not believe in specs, they shouldn't believe in deadlines either
