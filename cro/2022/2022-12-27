[19:09] <Xliff> jnthn: Have you thought of virtual hosting support for cro? 

[19:10] <lizmat> wouldn't that just be routing on the Host: header ?

[19:15] <Xliff> Yes. Can you link to that point in the docs, please?

[19:16] <Xliff> Ouch.... 

[19:16] <Xliff> :$host is header

[19:17] <Xliff> That gets messy.... I'll have to think about that one.

[19:17] <Xliff> Might be better to handle thosse in before()

[19:17] <lizmat> probably, yeah

[19:17] <Xliff> Thanks, Liz!
