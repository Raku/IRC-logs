[19:03] <andinus> so a crafted request mangled my terminal (unsupported method (i guess the method name was crafted to mangle terminal)) - i print the requests as they come

[19:04] <andinus> seems like Cro::HTTP::RequestParser simply prints them, does it make sense to escape those escape sequences on there?

[19:06] <andinus> maybe not there, is there a way to prevent the mangling?
