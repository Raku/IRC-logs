[16:52] <whatnext> hello all :) I have a basic question about organising routes: say I have some routes, and I want e.g. a new database connection each time any route is called, so my routes might be like `get -> 'page' { $db_connection.do_something() }` - how can I avoid explicitly creating $db_connection in every route?

[17:04] <lizmat> whatnext: most people here are currently away

[17:05] <lizmat> whatnext: https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-middleware#Choosing_how_to_apply_middleware may be of help?

[17:06] <whatnext> I did look through the docs, including the page you mentioned - but it was a bit overwhelming tbh '=D

[17:06] <lizmat> yes, it can be  :-)

[17:06] <whatnext> I wasn't even sure whether it was "middleware" that I wanted

[17:07] <whatnext> never mind, I will continue to research it

[17:08] <whatnext> thanks :)

[19:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> Potentially can use `around` (see the router docs) and use a dynamic variable (like $*DB)

[19:09] <jnthnwrthngtn> (Perhaps you have reasons, but setting up a connection every request sounds costly. I think DB::Pg maintains a connection pool.)
