[09:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> host is only used for binding the socket

[11:21] <tbrowder> hi, after many stupid mistakes, i see light at end of the tunnel—thanks!

[12:11] <tbrowder> with my current setup on apache: an https front end, and a cro app on the back end of a reverse proxy i get an A from SSL labs on the site, but a 503 response when i try to access the site in a chrome browser. i'm checking with the apache mailing list now to ensure the specific rev proxy syntax is entirely correct.

[12:13] <tbrowder> my cro app is basically the simple one shown on the cro.services site with the port being 10000

[12:15] <lizmat> tbrowder: FWIW, if you're setting up a new service, I would go fo nginx nowadays...

[12:49] <tbrowder> i looked into nginx when it first came out, but decided it was not for me since it was so different from apacahe. maybe a bad decision, but i don't regret it. i'm too invested in apache, and have a very secure setup which makes it easy to add new websites. if i can get cro working  i will be a happy camper and will start moving all my sites to using it.

[12:50] <tbrowder> i think i am very close (he said with fingers crossed)

[12:54] <tbrowder> if anyone is interested in apache, i have a repo on github detailing installation from source. i just updated it for httpd 2.4.52.

[22:49] <tbrowder> another cro question: why cannot the croapp be started to run in the background?

[22:52] <leont> My guess: backgrounding and threading are kind of incompatible :-/

[22:55] <tbrowder> doesn’t apache do that?

[22:55] <tbrowder> and nginx?

[22:56] <leont> You need to do it before starting any threads

[22:58] <leont> Because only the thread calling fork will survive to the child

[23:04] <tbrowder> ok, thnx, i think all the nohup stuff i used to did not involve progs having child processes.

[23:06] <tbrowder> maybe putting the app under systemd as moritz suggested would in effect do the same thing.

[23:19] <leont> Sort of.

[23:20] <leont> Good backgrounding only completes the backgrounding when the child is finished initializing itself

[23:20] <leont> I don't think that can be done without deep support inside moarvm

[23:21] <leont> Mostly functional backgrounding without that property can easily be done by a small wrapper

[23:21] <leont> I'm sure systemd will do that for you

[23:58] <tbrowder> i have managed to get a rev proxy working parially, but my logs show the connection to the backend (my croapp running in foreground) is refused. any suggestions?
