[19:00] <japhb> What went wrong with CBOR?

[20:05] *** sena_kun left
[20:18] <jnthn> japhb: It fails tests on an old enough Rakudo (some type check error)

[20:38] <japhb> Huh.  I wonder what I accidentally depended on ....

[20:40] <japhb> Was it Cro::CBOR or CBOR::Simple that failed?

[20:40] * japhb is going to file himself a bug report

[21:46] <jnthn> it was in the Cro::HTTP build, you can look at the Actions output for the commit just before the one where I did the change to see exactly how it failed

[22:19] <japhb> WTH?  That is a very strange error.  And the complaint it gives seems to be guarded against directly above!  Hmmmmm.

[22:26] <japhb> AH!  I believe I see the problem.  The actual compared values aren't *themselves* Mu, they *contain* Mu.  I'm guessing older Test modules did not have any protection against that.

[22:42] <japhb> It's not Test that changed, it's Mu: 750c5d04a9d72656a42800ef73a911cc82af998c fixed infix:<eqv> to not blow up on non-Any Mu.

[22:43] <japhb> If I'm reading the git log properly, that means that 2021.06 is the horizon for working CBOR::Simple tests.  :-(

[22:45] <jnthn> :(

[22:45] <jnthn> That's not that new, but also not particularly old.

[22:46] <japhb> The broken CBOR::Simple test got added three months later.  I bet I never had a time where it failed for me.

[22:46] <japhb> What horizon would you like to have?  I'll directly test against that one explicitly.

[22:50] <jnthn> It'd be nice to be able to leave 2021.03 working at least, since that's what we've tested against for a while

[22:50] <jnthn> The more useful answer is "what is packaged by recent distros", but I dunno if that information is collected somewhere.

[22:51] <japhb> I could probably find out for some of the open source ones.

[22:52] <japhb> I tried looking back in the Cro::HTTP actions logs, but the last time the tests all worked it was past the detailed log retention time.  :-(

[22:53] <japhb> I guess there's some value in actually having that answer (about the distro packaging).  Worth some time not thinking about my RakuConf presentation.  ;-)

[23:38] <japhb> A friend gave me a couple other common upstreams to add; doing so.
