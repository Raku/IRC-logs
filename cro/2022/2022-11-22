[10:06] <lizmat> Is there a particular reason why Cro::HTTP cannot be installed without forcing tests ?

[10:35] *** AlexDaniel left
[10:35] <jnthn> Yes, TLS tests depend on having a cert, but certs can only have a validity date so far into the future, which means after a while they expire, and the tests start failing

[10:36] <jnthn> The certs have already been regenerated, but given this has happened multiple times, I'm going to also move these tests under xt/ rather than t/ so they won't be run as the standard set of install-time tests.

[10:36] <jnthn> (So we don't have a repeat of this in the future)

[10:36] <jnthn> Otherwise we just repeat this in another year.

[10:38] *** AlexDaniel joined
[10:39] <lizmat> yeah, moving them to xt feels like the correct choice

[10:44] * jnthn wonders how many langs aside from Perl and Raku default to running module tests as part of their installation

[10:48] <lizmat> maybe they generate a new certificate during testing somehow ?

[10:51] <jnthn> No, I mean, Raku is a relative outlier in running tests *at all* as part of installing a module.

[10:53] <lizmat> ah, ok, yes...  I guess

[10:53] <lizmat> I'm so used to that      never thought it would be different anywhere else :-)

[10:57] <jnthn> This year aside from Raku I've worked in Node.js, .Net, Python, and Java, and none of them do it, thus my curiosity of who else does. :-)

[10:58] <jnthn> I guess the upside is "faster module installation" and the downside is "but who knows if it works on my machine".

[10:58] <lizmat> well, this was a case of a false negative  :-(
