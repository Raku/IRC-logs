[21:32] <melezhik> hi!

[21:32] <melezhik> my cro app reuse db handler to mysql database  across http requests, so I hit this error on and off - DBDish::mysql error - Unsupported Concurrency: Connection used by multiple threads simultaneously

[21:32] <melezhik> https://github.com/raku-community-modules/DBIish/issues/222

[21:32] <melezhik> any thought now can I handle / fix that on cro app side?

[21:33] <melezhik> this is how I pass db handler to cro app - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/8a5630e0ff407c6c726b60e48010a6c05d9d1547/bin/sparky-web.raku#L28

[22:55] <jnthnwrthngtn> .tell melezhik DB handles cannot be shared across threads; you could implement a thread pool but I personally always use DB::Pg instead because it has one built in.
