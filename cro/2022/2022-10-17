[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Implement remote window handling

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: The basic idea is to provide a mechanism of flow control back pressure, so

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: the remote end is not flodded with data it can't process fast enough.

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: The basic mechanism is as follows: We have a contingent of bytes we are

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: allowed to send in DATA frames to the remote party. If that contingent is

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: depleted we have to wait for the remote end to refresh it again via

[21:48] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: WINDOW_UPDATE frames before we can continue to send more DATA frames.

[21:49] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[21:49] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Cro::HTTP::Client::Pipeline2 relies on LAST to mark a connection as dead

[21:49] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: and thus not deadlocking when trying to use a dead connection.

[21:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: It seems to have worked fine even without this change. Not sure entirely

[21:52] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[21:52] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: All pairs contained are passed on to the underlying connector. This allows

[21:52] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: connector should TLS be used.

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: The changes merged in 50cf7987b led to some tests failing with the

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: error "Odd number of elements found where hash initializer expected".

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: This resolves the error and also makes sure that options passed with a

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: request take priority over the class-level settings, for consistency

[22:15] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: with how options handling works elsewhere in the client.
