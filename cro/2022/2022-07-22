[10:40] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Also I don't expect to make it possible, because I care about tooling for this stuff (Cro template language changes move in lockstep with Comma changes to provide IDE support)

[10:46] <lizmat> .

[10:47] * lizmat appears to have a flaky connection

[10:55] <jnthn> Curious that "flaky" is pretty much always a bad thing, except "flaky pastry", which is a great thing :)

[10:57] <lizmat> yeah, meanwhile we're seeing people working on the communication tower next door, and I wonder if these two things are related :-)

[20:56] <Xliff> I have a route that looks like this: get -> 'site', 'details ', $site, 'payment', $year  is copy, $month   is copy { ... }

[20:57] <Xliff> However when I navigate to /site/details/A81/payment/2021/2, it doesn't fire. The server sais it is not found and returns a 404. 

[20:58] <Xliff> s/sais/says/

[20:58] <Xliff> Another odd note is that it interprets the $month as a Str in that URI

[21:00] <Xliff> Or... it could be that embedded space in 'details '

[21:00] <jnthn> Yes, most likely that :)

[21:00] *** melezhik joined
[21:00] <japhb> That would do it, yes.  :-)

[21:00] <Xliff> :)

[21:01] <jnthn> If you want them parsed as Int then ass an Int type constraint

[21:01] <jnthn> uh, add 

[21:01] <Xliff> Hehehe.

[21:01] <Xliff> Thanks, jnthn

[21:04] <japhb> .oO( That's a sweet-ass type constraint you got there ... )

[21:04] <Xliff> Oooohh... japh. You should leave those smelly jokes to me.

[21:06] <japhb> *snrk*

[21:19] <japhb> jnthn: You've recently set up a fez org, I believe.  Were there docs for this, or did you just figure things out by spelunking code?

[21:27] <Xliff> How can I suppress this?

[21:27] <Xliff> "Useless use of a Cro `route` block in sink context. Did you forget to `include` or `delegate`?

[21:27] <Xliff>   in block  at /home/cbwood/Work/BizzellAppServer/app/lib/Bizzell/Routes.pm6 (Bizzell::Routes) line 68

[21:27] <Xliff> "

[21:27] <Xliff> This comes from using $*CRO-ROUTE-SET with no destination.

[21:29] <jnthn> japhb: https://deathbykeystroke.com/articles/20211220-fez-orgs-a-winter-solstice-miracle.html

[21:29] <jnthn> Why would you do that?

[21:30] <japhb> Thanks

[21:30] <japhb> Was that question for me or Xliff?

[21:30] <jnthn> Xliff. :)

[21:38] *** sena_kun left
[22:05] <Xliff> jnthn: This code was based on your suggestion from yesterday. So I tried overriding $*CRO-ROUTE-SET via $*CRO-ROUTE-SET does MyRole. That warning was the result.

[23:34] <SmokeMachine> is this expected on installing Cro on a M1 Mac? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/o2n6OtKK/CleanShot%202022-07-23%20at%2000.30.08%402x.png

[23:54] <Xliff> jnthn: Is there a way to track Cro's resource usage? For example, what would be the best way to dump the amount of memory being used?
