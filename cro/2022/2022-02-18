[00:43] <tbrowder> hm, should i try --force-install?

[07:51] <perlmaros> ok, thanks for the explanation  ... i will try to investigate further, but at first glance it looks like the downgrade of all Cro modules to 0.8.6. at least mitigated the massive memleak

[11:42] <tbrowder> success!

[11:43] <tbrowder> zef kept telling me HTTP::HPACK couldn't be upgraded because latest was there, but list --installed didn't show 0.9.3

[11:45] <tbrowder> i finally tried: zef install 'HTTP::HPACK:ver<0.9.3>' and got a successful install. then 'zef install Cro::WebPack' worked ok

[14:24] <japhb> tbrowder: Any idea why zef thought the latest was already installed?

[14:28] <lizmat> tbrowder: did you do "zef update" and then "zef upgrade HTTP::HPACK" ?

[14:36] <tbrowder> lizmat: i didn’t this morning, but i’m not sure when i did last.

[14:36] <tbrowder> doesn’t zef update every time it searches?

[14:37] <tbrowder> i also did zef upgrade zef

[14:39] <lizmat> zef only updates if it thinks its local cache is out of date...   which it is after an hour I believe

[14:41] <tbrowder> maybe i should have a cron job do that cause i can’t remember the cmd ;-(
