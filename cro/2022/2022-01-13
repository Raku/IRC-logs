[12:55] <patrickb> o/

[13:02] <patrickb> I'm thinking about how to best add FCGI functionality to Cro. I could either cram it into cro-http or have a separate cro-fcgi project depending on cro-http. If craming it into cro-http I could either extend Cro::HTTP::Server to also support FCGI or implement my own Cro::FCGI::Server.

[13:02] <patrickb> Can someone offer some advice which route to go?

[13:27] <Altai-man> patrickb, 1)I am pretty sure Cro::FCGI is the option, Cro::HTTP is huge already. 2)Subclassing Cro::HTTP::Server::FCGI seems fine to me, though jnthnwrthngtn can have other opinion.

[14:08] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, agree with separate module

[14:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> It doesn't to me feel like a natural subclass, unless there's substantial re-use; it may turn out to be better to extract some Cro::HTTP::Endpoint role if there's stuff to share

[14:55] <patrickb> Those answers match my feeling. I think the parts that will end up being shared are the Request and Response classes.

[14:56] <patrickb> So simply depending on cro-http and using those classes will probably do.

[14:57] <patrickb> btw. has https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/161 slipped under the radar?

[15:10] <jnthnwrthngtn> Ah yes, I wasn't feeling clever enough to review it at the time you sent it, and then did indeed forget; sorry.

[15:57] <patrickb> Don't worry. I'm not particularly pressed to get that merged, I'd just like for it to not be forgotten.

[18:08] <Skarsnik> Hello :) Is there a way to have a more 'complete' output from cro?. I am trying to figure why it does not serve a .wasm file as application/wasm x)

[18:09] <Altai-man> Skarsnik, are you aware about CRO_TRACE=1 env var?

[18:10] <Skarsnik> Oh thx :)

[18:11] <Skarsnik> ok, it serves it as application/octet-stream even if I added mime-types => {'multiclient.wasm' => 'application/wasm'}; in my base route ~~

[18:17] <Altai-man> sounds like a bug, can you open a ticket with a short gist? :)

[18:17] <Skarsnik> Ho, this take the extension

[18:18] <Skarsnik> this works fine now ^^

[18:26] <Xliff> Skarsnik: Are you using 'static' to set the mime type?

[18:26] <Skarsnik> yes

[18:26] <Xliff> OK. Sounds like you got it working?

[18:26] <Skarsnik> static 'www', @path, :indexes<index.html>, mime-types => {

[18:26] <Skarsnik>                 'wasm' => 'application/wasm'

[18:26] <Skarsnik>             };

[18:27] <Skarsnik> kinda weird that not the proper default thou ^^

[18:27] <Xliff> Might want to create a module that establishes the proper default and send in a PR or keep it as an external module.

[19:13] <Xliff> I'm getting "Cannot write to a closed socket" on request I make with PHP. Does anyone have any ideas as to how this might occur?

[20:51] <jnthnwrthngtn> Skarsnik: Please submit a PR to add it to https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/lib/Cro/HTTP/MimeTypes.pm6

[20:58] <Skarsnik> I am confused, I have a simple form with a select box that do a submit on a button. A route post -> 'create-session', :$game! is query {} should work? or the post param are elsewhere?

[21:00] <jnthnwrthngtn> Elsewhere, `is query` is from the query string

[21:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> See the router docs, the section about request bodies

[21:01] <jnthnwrthngtn> But approximately, `request-body -> (:$game!, *%) { }` inside of your route handler

[21:02] <Skarsnik> Hoo thanks

[21:15] <Skarsnik> unrelated, maybe the cro runner could not restart on change on ~ file? eg: (change to /mnt/f/Project/multithingy/server/lib/Multithingy/Routes.rakumod~)

[21:18] <jnthnwrthngtn> Skarsnik: iirc you can add exclude patterns in the .cro.yml

[21:19] <jnthnwrthngtn> https://cro.services/docs/cro-yml#Controlling_automatic_restarts

[21:23] <Skarsnik> Ok, I have a page that create me session of something, redirect me an uuid4 url. that load some js & webasm code. Took me 5h xD

[21:24] <Skarsnik> jnthnwrthngtn, you are working on Comma also? if so, do you think it would be easy to add a support for wsl terminal on the windows release? x)

[21:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> Skarsnik: Does it work if in Settings > Tools > Terminal you set the shell to use wsl.exe?

[21:48] <Skarsnik> oh, this actually work ^^

[21:49] <Skarsnik> I did not think there was an exe available for this

[21:59] <Skarsnik> this will save me some annoyance, thank :)
