[00:25] <Xliff> jnthn: I am trying to process form data and I am geting an error message like this: Died with the exception:

[00:25] <Xliff>     Cannot unbox a type object (Nil) to int.

[00:25] <Xliff>       in sub decode-payload-to-pairs at /home/cbwood/.rakubrew/versions/moar-blead/install/share/perl6/site/sources/93800D0139DFB402128E680453A9BE46DB678C9E (Cro::HTTP::BodyParsers) line 62

[00:26] <Xliff> When trying to print ou t the raw request body with "(await request.body).decode", I am getting a null string. This is odd, because the form has data. Is this a bug?

[08:33] <jnthn> Sounds like a bug

[08:33] <jnthn> Please report it with a reproduction

[10:47] <Altreus> Hi all. Did anyone get a chance to glance at my question about websocket disconnection? In theory if I disconnect with code 1000 the bot should go offline immediately, but the bot always has to time out instead. Am I doing it wrong? https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/blob/disconnect-on-destroy/lib/API/Discord/WebSocket.rakumod#L167

[10:47] <Altreus> called from https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/blob/disconnect-on-destroy/lib/API/Discord.rakumod#L187

[12:16] <Xliff> jnthn: It was because the <input> tags didn't have a name attribute.

[13:09] <Altreus> Xliff: Wasn't sure if you knew you could write (await request.body).decode as request.body.result.decode - I find it cleaner

[13:09] <Altreus> (I do wish I could just put await in the middle there)

[13:09] <Altreus> await promise <-> promise.await

[13:09] <Altreus> but alas no

[13:20] <jnthn> Not aware of anything that'd block implementing such in Rakudo :)

[13:26] * Altreus lays down the gauntlet

[13:26] <Altreus> but not I :D

[13:26] <Altreus> jnthn: since you're alive, do you have a mo to peer at my conundrum ^?

[13:34] <SmokeMachine> is this expected? I'm on m1 Mac: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EJpC6NMR/CleanShot%202022-08-30%20at%2014.32.39%402x.png

[13:36] <jnthn> I've learned to expect everything about Mac to be a shitshow :P

[13:36] <jnthn> I recently released a new IO::Socket::Async::SSL that had a Mac fix somebody sent a PR for, and they reenabled the Mac CI and it passed

[13:37] <jnthn> But that wasn't the error the fixed

[13:41] <Altreus> so "is this expected" is tautologically yes, and can be replaced at compile time

[13:44] <jnthn> Altreus: Looks like it picks 1000 as the default code here: https://github.com/croservices/cro-websocket/blob/96c7a31446032aa80e502651b68beec9be1817ed/lib/Cro/WebSocket/Client/Connection.pm6#L133

[13:45] <jnthn> Oh, but I don't think you `await` the `Promise` that `close` returns, maybe that is the issue?

[13:46] <Altreus> er hold on, I think I do somewhere ...

[13:47] <Altreus> jnthn: I added this script-mode option and I'm using it in the echo server example https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/blob/disconnect-on-destroy/lib/API/Discord.rakumod#L187

[13:48] <Altreus> It definitely takes a tad longer to exit than it used to

[13:48] <Altreus> I should say "bye" eh

[13:55] <Altreus> oh, looks like it handles the close event and reconnects!

[13:57] <jnthn> Haha...when your code fights itself :)

[13:57] <Altreus> And looks like the close code in «whenever $!conn.closer -> $close» is BigEndian

[13:58] <Altreus> Is that part of the websocket standard? As in is there scope for the closer promise to return something a bit smarter?

[14:00] <jnthn> I'd assume endianness is part of the standard. Can't remember the details without looking at the standard (and have a meeting to disappear to now...)

[14:01] <Altreus> no probs, "enjoy"!
