[08:38] <kawaii_> Is it not possible to use `request` or `request-body` in a middleware block? I assume not because it isn't really a request handler but I thought it might be the easiest way for me to validate the content-type of my payload, since according to the docs these routines automatically throw a nice HTTP client error when they can't unpack  it https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/moPUVfeI/

[09:36] <jnthnwrthngtn> You can use `request`/`response` in those, but `request-body` is going to run you into the same bother (it's consumable only once)
