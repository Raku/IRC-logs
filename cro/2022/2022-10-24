[18:42] <Xliff> jnthn: Is there a way to make a Cro server pause taking requests?

[19:01] *** Xliff left
[19:32] <jnthn> What does "pause" mean here? Stop pushing them through the pipeline? Send an instant error response indicating the sever is too busy? Just close the TCP connection?

[19:33] <jnthn> Should be possible with a bit of middleware or with an alternative listener implementation
