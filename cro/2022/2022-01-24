[18:02] <jnthnwrthngtn> andinus: I guess you could write a bit of middleware that strips a trailing / off or similar

[18:03] <jnthnwrthngtn> before { request.target = request.target.chop if request.target.ends-with('/') } or some such

[18:04] <jnthnwrthngtn> before { request.target .= chop if request.target.ends-with('/') } # a bit less repetitive

[18:05] <lizmat> .oO( .chomp needs an argument:  request.target .= chomp("/") )

[18:53] <andinus> thanks that will work

[18:53] <andinus> i'll probably setup a  rdirect instead, dicsussion in #raku https://paste.debian.net/hidden/631747b2/

[21:32] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yes; can use a similar approach, just call `redirect` in the `before` with the tweaked url :)
