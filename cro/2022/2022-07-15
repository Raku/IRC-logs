[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Implement conditional structural tags

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: So `<?.website a href="<.website>">Visit Website</?>` will render the

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: anchor tag if the condition is true, placing the closing `</a>` as if

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: it were written prior to the `</?>`. Works for negative conditions

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: also.

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Implement iteration structural tags

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: So that instead of `<@.foo><li><$_></li></@>`, one can instead write

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: `<@.foo li><$_></li>` to achieve the same result.

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Merge pull request #74 from croservices/structural-tags

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Add structural tag shortcut syntax

[10:34] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/commit/c3055f07ba

[10:37] <lizmat> whee!  :-)

[11:54] <jnthn> Figured it was time to merge that. Looking into some template-location and related buglets today :)

[12:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Handle prelude fully in repository base role

[12:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[12:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: This means that those creating custom template repositories need not

[12:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: be concerned with having to handle it. Resolves one of the two issues

[12:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: noted in #71.

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Add a way to get a route handler resource resolver

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Returns a function that can be used to resolve resources as they would

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: be resolved in the current route handler. This is useful in the case

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: that the resolution would take place in a different dynamic scope - for

[14:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: example, template compilation.

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Refactor template location handling

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: The resolver is now given a list of location objects which it can use to

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: attempt to resolve the template. This gives the `resolve` method in a

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: repository complete control over the resolution process, rather than it

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: being partially contained in `render-template` as before now. Thus this

[14:50] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: closes #71. This is also groundwork for fixing #62.

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Honour route block template locations in `use`

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: 

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: Previously we only paid attention to the `template-location` that is

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: declared as part of the `route` block (or templates from resources) in a

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: direct resolution of a template, but didn't pass these down in order for

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: them to be used when one template `use`d another. With this change, we

[15:23] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp: do so. Fixes #62.

[17:06] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Support route block plugins in before/after blocks

[17:06] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[17:06] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: This should unblock being able to use templates in before/after, as

[17:06] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: requseted in https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/73.

[21:36] <jnthn> Hurrah. If you're feeling super-enthusiastic about it, maybe a test to cover it in Cro::WebApp is nice :)
