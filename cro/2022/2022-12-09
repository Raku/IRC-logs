[11:41] <patrickb> I have progressed in my bug hunt. I have golfed the problem down to a few whenevers. I think I mostly understand the problem.

[11:45] <patrickb> The whenever serialization logic that replaces $*AWAITER with a custom awaiter that only collects continuations and afterwards processes those ends up in a deadlock of two such supply blocks recurse. Then the second of those whenever processors copies its whenevers into the other whenever collector, not into the ThreadPoolAwaiter.

[11:47] <patrickb> I still need to fill a few open ends in my understanding and then I should think about possible fixes.

[11:51] <patrickb> I'm very sure it's not a cro bug. I'll continue rubberducking in #raku-dev.
