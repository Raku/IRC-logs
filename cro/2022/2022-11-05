[12:33] <patrickb> I'm looking at another HTTP2 misbehavior of Cro. From the packet dump it looks as if Cro::Client ignores GoAway packets (and thus happily tries to reuse a closed connection). Looking at https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/lib/Cro/HTTP2/GeneralParser.pm6#L169 it seems GoAway handling isn't implemented at all. Am I missing something and the logic is in some other place?

[13:30] <jnthn> patrickb: Probably not, it's probably just unimplemented

[13:40] <patrickb> OK. I'm working on it.

[13:43] <patrickb> I'm a bit stumped on how to implement this though. A GoAway means that some (existing) streams are kept alive and may still return and receive, new streams are forbidden though. Practically the connection is dead. But how can I communicate this outwards from the ResponseParser? It currently only returns responses or closes the supply.

[13:45] <patrickb> Closing the supply mostly achieves the goal of making sure the connection isn't used again: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/blob/master/lib/Cro/HTTP/Client.pm6#L182

[13:45] <patrickb> But then I also prevent existing streams from finishing up.

[13:46] <lizmat> feels like it needs some "global" flag not to accept any new connections, and carry on as usual otherwise ?

[13:46] <patrickb> Usually the GoAway is the end of the communication, not followed up with more data from the server, but the spec is clear, that certain streams are allowed to finish up.

[13:47] <patrickb> I'm AFK for an hour or so, but I'll backlog then and have a few more hours of time to spend on this later today.

[13:47] * lizmat also afk&

[14:50] <patrickb> I'm back.
