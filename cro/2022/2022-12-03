[20:27] <patrickb> o/ More debugging. I have now traced the problem down to Lock::Async. I have a lock that is `protect-or-queue-on-recursion()`ed multiple times non recursively. The second call blocks but does not proceed even though the rist caller finished its code.

[20:36] <japhb> patrickb: Sometimes or every time?

[20:50] <patrickb> Sometimes.

[20:50] <patrickb> 1/4 or so.

[20:53] <patrickb> I'm quite confident the non-reproducibility comes from different timings of Cro. (My smallest golf is a standard Cro::HTTP::Client call.)

[21:10] <patrickb> Hm. It seems as if a simple $vow.keep() doesn't trigger the corresponding `$*AWAITER.await($promise);`
