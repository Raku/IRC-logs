[10:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm guessing that's a Rakudo regression and will be (or has already been) caught by blin?

[10:58] <lizmat> jnthnwrthngtn: don't think so, it's listed as a "zef failure" 

[11:00] <lizmat> and therefore not taken as a blocker

[12:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> Oops. Does that mean any module that regresses in a way that makes it hang in tests won't become a blocker?

[12:45] <lizmat> possibly..  I'm not sure what the "zef failure" status actually means

[12:46] <lizmat> perhaps that it couldn't be installed even without tests ?
