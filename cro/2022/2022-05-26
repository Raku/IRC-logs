[15:17] <Xliff_> jnthn: Can you tell me the best way to introspect what routes are available?

[15:20] <jnthn> Xliff_: Don't think there is anything that dumps them at present

[15:32] <Xliff_> jnthn: Yeah, I think I had to collect them, somehow.

[15:32] <Xliff_> Had a control panel at one point, but lost that code in an HD crash. :(

[15:33] <Xliff_> Maybe... collected the routesets and preserved them?

[15:34] <Xliff_> At any rate... when I collect the code I'll share it.
