[19:04] <jdv> anyone else see Cro::HTTP tests hang?

[19:04] <jdv> looks like http-timeout.t at 14

[19:04] <jdv> or around there ^H

[19:22] <japhb> Hmmm, I'll run a full rebuild and see if it happens to me

[20:19] <jdv> it doesn't happen 100% for me

[20:20] <jdv> 1 in 3 maybe

[20:24] <japhb> Ah.  Yeah, it worked for me this time.

[20:38] <jnthnwrthngtn> I've never seen it happen myself, and this is the first report I've seen of it.

[20:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> That is a fairly recently added test file, but still, it's there for some months.
