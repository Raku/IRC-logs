[18:50] <Xliff> Hi. I have static classes that I use to implement Applications at the Cro::Route layer. Is there a mechanism to attach request/response specific data  to the request object so that my static Application classes can remain thread (and request) safe.

[18:51] <Xliff> The use case here is Database Pools.

[18:51] <Xliff> Thanks.

[21:44] <jnthn> Xliff: Use the `annotations` hash on the Cro::HTTP::Request object: `$request.annotations<conn> = $conn`

[21:45] <jnthn> (It's how Log::Timeline attaches a task to a request so it can log its processing details)

[21:45] <jnthn> (But was made a generic mechanism for use-cases like yours.)
