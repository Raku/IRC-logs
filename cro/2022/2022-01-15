[00:44] <Yeuph> Is there anybody here that'd be willing to lend me a little help getting Comma running?  I'm very inexperienced speaking generally with programming and such.  Comma doesn't seem to be able to run any code (both shift+F10 and the triangle run icon won't work).  I'm not experienced enough to know if I'm just doing something really silly and wrong

[00:44] <Yeuph> or if there is some larger problem I've had with my installation.  I'm fairly sure Comma sees the compiler as "Raku v2021.12" is selected under File -> Project Structure -> Raku Compilers
