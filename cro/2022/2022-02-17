[12:34] <perlmaros> yesterday i did a zef upgrade for a cro application (websocket server/client+http server/client) wich upgraded to the latest cro 0.8.7 and rakudo.  Since then the application started losing the websocket client connection every couple of minutes, and showed a massive memory leak. not sure what is causing this issue yet, but when i tried to downgrade cro i couldn't install the modules without --force-test because the Cro::HTTP/WebSocket test failed with 'S

[12:34] <perlmaros> certificate verification failed: certificate has expired'

[12:36] <lizmat> that last one is a known issue of testing that older version, afaik

[23:21] <tbrowder> i was able to install Cro::WebApp on one server, but not another. both are running latest Raku on Debian. Failure is Cro::HTTP:ver<0.8.7>.

[23:22] <tbrowder> both have HTTP::HPACK:ver<0.9.3>

[23:23] <tbrowder> trying a third server...

[23:26] <lizmat> also make sure you have IO::Socket::Async::SSL:ver<0.7.10>

[23:35] <tbrowder> yes, third server installed ok. checking #2 again for correct IO*

[23:36] <tbrowder> yep, it has v0.7.10

[23:41] <tbrowder> the prob msgs mention timeout exceeding limits reaching localhost

[23:42] <tbrowder> had the same prob on first server till i updated HTTP::HPACK

[23:55] <tbrowder> arg, it was a zefism where the IO::* path was munged somehow, and i lied about the ver installed. i got zef to install the right one by specifying ver and auth. i probably confused zef on an earlier install

[23:59] <tbrowder> hm, Cro::HTTP still not testing ok

[23:59] <tbrowder> i'll keep fooling with it, bye
