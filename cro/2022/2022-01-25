[07:51] <andinus> say i want to return a specific page on 404, i set `after { content('text/html', $404-page) if .status == 404 };`

[07:52] <andinus> oh, never mind, it works as expected, i thought `content` would eat up the status

[08:23] <jnthnwrthngtn> Yeah, content does something like response.status //= 200, it won't replace an existing status
