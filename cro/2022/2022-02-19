[13:32] <tbrowder> is anyone using cro for a tls connection on port 443? if so, cnan

[13:33] <tbrowder> *can you handle multiple domains via the cert named args?

[13:37] <tbrowder> in other words, it seems as if the tls app doesn't provide the correct cert info it will hopefully ignore it. that way i could have two separate apps running, each listening to the same port but responding only to the correct domain.

[13:39] <tbrowder> my goal is to have multiple virtual domains handled on one instance of apache httpd server.

[13:39] <tbrowder> without haproxy

[19:22] <leont> Mentioning it here, since I suspect the people who care are concentrated: I just released Net::Postgres, my fully asynchronous postgresql client :-)

[19:36] <japhb> leont: Might want to mention on #red as well, since that's all DB-using folk

[19:36] <leont> Fair point
