[20:50] <Xliff> Has anyone seen a Hash class with a default value?

[20:50] <Xliff> So if a key doesn't exist, instead of NIl, it returns something else?

[20:54] <Xliff> Could someone poke some holes in this?

[20:54] <Xliff> m: my %hash; role HashDefault[\T] { method AT-KEY (\k) { callwith(k) // T }; }; class C { }; %hash does HashDefault[C]; %hash<a> = 1; %hash<a>.say; %hash<b>.say; %hash.^name.say

[20:54] <Xliff> Oops. Wrong channel. Sorry.

[21:58] *** sena_kun left
[22:22] <lizmat> m: my %h is default(42); dd %h<a>   # Xliff 

[22:22] <lizmat> my %h is default(42); dd %h<a>'

[22:22] <lizmat> Int %h{'a'} = 42
