[08:38] <patrickb> Congrats in the release!

[08:40] <patrickb> Just noticed, that the cro-core media type parsing fix (PR #36) didn't make it. That's one for the next release I guess.

[09:42] <jnthn> Yeah, there's a few more things in that category, but it'd been sufficiently long since the last release and there were so many things merged and ready to go I figured it was better to cut one now and then have another one not too far into the future
