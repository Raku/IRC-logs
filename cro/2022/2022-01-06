[19:13] <lizmat> not strictly a Cro question, but perhaps related:

[19:13] <lizmat> If I have:

[19:13] <lizmat>             react {

[19:13] <lizmat>                 whenever $server.socket.Supply :bin -> $buf is copy {

[19:13] <lizmat>                     CATCH { default { warn $_; warn .backtrace } }

[19:13] <lizmat>                 }

[19:13] <lizmat>             }

[19:13] <lizmat> and the CATCH warns that the connection timed out, will it drop out of the react ?

[19:13] <lizmat> or would I have to do a "done" ?

[22:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> Hm, I think that'd have to be QUIT instead of `CATCH` if it's an async exception? But you'd need a `done`, anyway.
