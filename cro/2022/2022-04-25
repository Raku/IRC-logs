[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: Implement conditional structural tags

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: 

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: So `<?.website a href="<.website>">Visit Website</?>` will render the

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: anchor tag if the condition is true, placing the closing `</a>` as if

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: it were written prior to the `</?>`. Works for negative conditions

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: also.

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: Implement conditional iteration tags

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: 

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: So that instead of `<@.foo><li><$_></li></@>`, one can instead write

[22:11] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/structural-tags: `<@.foo li><$_></li>` to achieve the same result.

[22:16] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: Given your above commits, what's the new idiom for showing a list *or* showing a replacement of a different type, like <p> or so?

[23:10] *** melezhik joined
[23:18] <jnthnwrthngtn> japhb: If I understand what you mean, it means you'd get to do now: <?.foo ul><@.foo li><$_></@></?> <!.foo p>...</!>

[23:18] <jnthnwrthngtn> Which saves the </ul>, </li>, and </p> having to be written

[23:20] *** melezhik left
[23:33] <japhb> OK, makes sense, thank you.

[23:39] <jnthnwrthngtn> I'm pondering that a bare <!>...</!> (without a condition) could immediately follow a <?.foo>...</?> (well, whitespace allowed between them) and serve as an "else"

[23:40] <japhb> jnthnwrthngtn: Well, as long as "immediately follow" allows whitespace between, yeah, I like that idea.

[23:40] <jnthnwrthngtn> Then it'd be <! p>...</!> and one less mention of the `.foo`

[23:41] <jnthnwrthngtn> Although it arguably looks a tad odd :)

[23:42] <jnthnwrthngtn> Anyway, sleep time for me o/

[23:46] <japhb> Good night!
