[17:21] <SmokeMachine> is there any type I can return to a `<.my-method>` that would make an "automatic" &HTML? (that wouldn't auto-escape)

[19:47] <SmokeMachine> My PoC just started working... I don't think that's very useful, but I find it very cool... It's a way of adding to Cro some web components using pro template and web socket, so, when a event you added a handler to, is emitted, the browser sends it back to the server to let it process the event, and any time the component calls .redraw, it is update it on browser...

[21:16] <JRaspass> It would be nice if there was a subtype of Str that wasn't HTML escaped, that's how Go does it

[21:17] *** sena_kun left
[21:17] <SmokeMachine> JRaspass: yes, I thought the same

[21:18] <JRaspass> I've not actually looked how &HTML does it, maybe it's special cased in the escape logic

[21:20] <SmokeMachine> I also would like to be able to create strings, arrays, etc and pass them as parameters to method calls

[21:21] <JRaspass> I just want an else block, very tired of typing <?.foo>...</?><!.foo>...</!>

[21:25] <JRaspass> looking forward to the structural tags though, they'll help simplify some of the raku land templates i think

[21:37] <SmokeMachine> JRaspass: have you seen my PoC (https://github.com/FCO/Cro-WebSocket-WebComponents-test/blob/main/lib/Routes.pm6)? Any opinion about that?

[21:40] <JRaspass> so are these components as in the standard js ones, with shadow dom etc? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components

[21:41] <SmokeMachine> no, they are just pro-template... that you can map the events to be sent back to the server by web socket...

[21:42] <JRaspass> oh i see, neat

[21:43] <JRaspass> never used web sockets in anger, all my sites are just old school html with a sprinkling of css, so old fashioned :-P

[21:43] <JRaspass> *css/js

[21:46] <SmokeMachine> I've done that thinking on doing something like the island architecture but without JS...

[21:46] <japhb> I use WebSockets quite a bit -- but not for webpages.  Just as a really low-overhead transport that Cro understands natively].  :-)

[21:48] <SmokeMachine> japhb: and what do you think about that usage on my PoC?

[21:49] <japhb> I haven't looked at it.  I've been buried in two *other* Raku projects today.  :-P

[21:50] <SmokeMachine> japhb: if interested: https://github.com/FCO/Cro-WebSocket-WebComponents-test/blob/main/lib/Routes.pm6

[21:50] <japhb> OK, I'll throw that on my list for "need a mental switch"  :-D
