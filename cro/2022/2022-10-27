[02:19] <japhb> jnthn: Have you managed to get IO::Socket::Async::SSL working against libssl3.so (AKA libssl.so.3), which is the OpenSSL shipped with Ubuntu 22.04/Mint 21?

[02:19] <japhb> It could be just a matter of fixing the library name, or there could be API differences ...

[02:39] <japhb> Actually, no, libssl3.so and libssl.so.3 appear to be different, I misread a filesystem link

[02:39] <japhb> Still makes me wonder what's not right here, hmmm

[02:58] <japhb> Welp, it's not the fault of IO::Socket::Async::SSL, which does in fact have detection/handling of libssl.so.3.  It's IRC::Client, which wants to force IO::Socket::Async::SSL version 0.7.10, which was before the OpenSSL version handling was fixed.  *sigh*

[09:37] <jnthn> Was gonna say, I'm pretty sure an Ubuntu 22.04 images was what I used to test the fixes for libssl3...

[09:38] <jnthn> I'd probably do :ver<0.7.14+> to permit improved patch versions

[09:47] <lizmat> japhb: IRC::Client 4.0.9 now in ecosystem
