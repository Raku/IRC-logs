[12:28] <Xliff> Is there a way of passing the output of one template sub to another template sub?

[12:28] <Xliff> ^^ sena_kun jnthn?

[12:37] <Altai-man> sure

[12:37] <Altai-man> Xliff, what you need to do is instead of using `template` sub use `render-template`.

[12:38] <Altai-man> instead of setting the response it'll return you the text
