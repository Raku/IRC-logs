[15:23] <[Coke]> Haven't forgotten the golf for that windows failure, but it's challening. :|

[15:41] <[Coke]> aha: https://gist.github.com/coke/0c6518edb9d8295e4784f0247a7a7bbf

[15:42] <[Coke]> there's a golfed error on windows for the output-socket.t test in Log::Timeline; the last line dies with "Cannot write to a closed socket"

[15:44] <[Coke]> if I output .WHERE on the $conn object before and after the last assignment to $conn, it changes.

[15:53] <[Coke]> updated, got it down to 8 lines of code, 2 debug statements and some comments

[15:54] <[Coke]> Will update ticket

[15:55] <[Coke]> done

[16:11] <jnthnwrthngtn> [Coke]: Thanks, will try and get that to that soon. Putting in a bit of time on Cro things to get a release out in the coming weeks.

[17:02] <Geth> ¦ cro-core: If we have a valid IRI then it already has all percent encoding that a

[17:02] <Geth> ¦ cro-core: anything outside of ASCII range to be percent-encoded in order to form a

[17:02] <Geth> ¦ cro-core: valid URI. Thus explicitly pick out the non-ASCII range when deciding
