[19:24] <lizmat> I don't know how it is for other people, but *all* of my modules that depend on Cro::HTTP::Client currently will *NOT* install on the Github Actions CI, which makes tests fail and which is very annpying  :-)

[19:27] <japhb> lizmat: Because of Cro::HTTP::Client itself, or one of its dependencies?

[19:27] <lizmat> you tell me: https://github.com/lizmat/Updown/runs/5071580211?check_suite_focus=true

[19:28] <japhb> Oh yeah, that's Digest.  It's a bug in the module, exposed by the uint work.  There's already PR sent by nine++, it just probably hasn't been merged and then uploaded to an ecosystem yet.

[19:31] <lizmat> Digest was updated 7 hours ago ?

[19:32] <lizmat> meh

[19:32] <lizmat> afk&

[19:33] <japhb> Version 0.4.0 is the one that fails for me.

[19:33] <japhb> Oh, do you mean the repo was updated?

[19:34] <lizmat> I guess

[19:34] <lizmat> it's a github repo, I guess the version was not updated :-(

[19:35] <japhb> Yeah, was about to say the same thing.  Looks like the merge happened, and even some commits after that point ... but no version bump and ecosystem upload yet.

[19:38] <lizmat> really afk&
