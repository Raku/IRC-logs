[21:32] <lizmat> Q: can you have more than one Cro::HTTP::Client object in a process accessing the same URL without interfering with each other ?

[21:53] <jnthnwrthngtn> Separate instances of that should be entirely independent. (That said, a given instance is already meant to be safe for concurrent use.)

[21:55] <lizmat> well, I'm seeing weird hangs when writing tests for the Updown module

[21:55] <lizmat> that actually try to access the Updown.io site

[21:56] <lizmat> am pretty sure it's not throttling from the server side, as running the same fetch in curl in rapid succession, doesn't hang

[23:12] <lizmat> uncomment this line: https://github.com/lizmat/Updown/blob/e95cfa372c7382a7d53fefdb240712d4a8996a30/t/08-fetch.rakutest#L10

[23:13] <lizmat> and the script will hang on trying the second Updown object

[23:13] <lizmat> sleep&
