[15:04] <thundergnat_> I've just updated to the latest Raku release and am having difficulties getting cro to install. 

[15:04] <thundergnat_> All of its dependencies test and install ok, it just fails on the main package.

[15:05] <thundergnat_> I've tried clearing all of the zef temp directories, clearing that Raku .precomp directories, still no joy.  

[15:05] <thundergnat_> Any ideas?

[15:06] <thundergnat_> https://gist.github.com/thundergnat/ef82efe1f1cd876ea1e439fa0b4fe33e   <-- install fail

[15:13] <lizmat> you might want to upgrade IO::Socket::Async::SSL

[15:19] <thundergnat_> I blew away my entire raku install and installed everything from scratch, built from source. Not sure how much more I can upgrade it.
