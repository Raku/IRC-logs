[09:26] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Pretty sure that works (and should work)

[09:28] <SmokeMachine> maybe I was doing something wrong... but I've resolved that in a different way... it was saying it couldn't find an argument to my :part... I've resolved that with a single part with 2 arguments... (https://github.com/FCO/Cro-WebSocket-WebComponents-test/blob/main/resources/index.crotmp#L7)

[09:29] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: is that possible to return an specific type and that mean that it should use &HTML and/or &HTML-AND-JAVASCRIPT automatically?

[09:30] <SmokeMachine> s/an/a/

[09:36] <SmokeMachine> son here (https://github.com/FCO/Cro-WebSocket-WebComponents-test/blob/main/resources/index.crotmp#L8) for example, I could do: <$todos.new(:$todo-list)> and the obj created could have an .Str that would (call .render, and) return that type, automatically not escaping the content.

[10:23] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Please can you make issues for these (and some of the other wishes you had); I'm 200% sure that I'm going to forget all these otherwise :)

[10:24] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: sure! but is that something would make sense?

[10:24] <jnthn> It may do, yes.

[10:24] <jnthn> I mean, I want to think about it a bit, but my first reaction is that it's reasonable 

[10:50] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/77

[10:50] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: the type names aren't suggestions, but I had to use any name to make sense
