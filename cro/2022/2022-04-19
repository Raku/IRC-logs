[19:58] <melezhik> Hi!

[19:58] <melezhik> what is the best to deploy cro app in production?

[19:58] <melezhik> considering HA aspect?

[19:59] <melezhik> will `cro run` work? I know it watches files changes, but besides that, what are other limitation of this method with respect to production mode?

[20:02] <melezhik> also sometimes (I suspect due to issues of communication with mysql server ) my cro app "freeze" in a sense, stops responding to request ("connection refused" error when run with curl)

[20:02] <melezhik> and I don't get any logs neither in http response Â  headers nor in application logs

[20:03] <melezhik> and all I have to do is to restart my cro app

[20:11] <japhb> The MySQL issues may be from timeouts; I believe Db::Pg is known to be better about connection pooling and lifetime (but then of course you need to be running Postgres)

[20:12] <japhb> As for production deployment, I believe some people rig up their own management layer, while others use a stock one such as kubernetes
