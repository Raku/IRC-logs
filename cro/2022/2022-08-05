[09:31] <Altreus> Heyo all. I was looking at this issue and it seems like all I need to do is close the websocket with a 1000 code when exiting, but I can't figure out how to do that. https://github.com/shuppet/raku-api-discord/issues/56

[09:32] <Altreus> I think perhaps it already should do that when the websocket object is destroyed, but alas I can't entirely follow the Cro websocket code

[09:33] <Altreus> perhaps I need to await something so the connection isn't killed when the process terminates?

[20:04] <Xliff> My biggest question now is how do I write a grammar method so I can copy captures when I create a new Match object with the proper position?

[20:30] <Xliff> How can I change "\n" to be interpreted as "\r\n" inside an existing string?
