[12:43] <Xliff> sena_kun: I think you misunderstand. I need to do this inside a template. Mainly because the loop construct is there, so it's impossible to break out of raku to get it.

[12:43] <Xliff> Is there a way to pass a Raku callable into a template?

[12:43] <sena_kun> aaaaah

[12:45] <sena_kun> I think it should be possible, no?

[12:45] <sena_kun> you certainly can call callables in a template

[12:46] <Xliff> Yeah, but how can you use it inside the template?

[12:46] <sena_kun> say you have a template like this: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/blob/master/t/test-data/topic-4.crotmp#L1

[12:46] <sena_kun> then call like this: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/blob/master/t/template-basic.rakutest#L60-L68

[12:46] <sena_kun> so you interpolate results of the call into a template?

[12:47] <sena_kun> sorry, I already forgot your question, so it might be not exactly what you want

[12:47] <Xliff> Again, you are calling from raku. I need to call from inside the template itself.

[12:48] <sena_kun> "<.m('pos', :y('named'))>" <- isn't it a call from the template?

[12:55] <Xliff> sena_kun - I'm trying that way, now./

[13:04] <Xliff> sena_kun: This results in a template parsing error: <td class="<.mergespaces( &cellClass($day, $d, $_) )>">

[13:04] <Xliff> .mergespaces is a raku sub.

[13:04] <Xliff> &cellClass is a template sub

[13:05] <Xliff> I doubt I can run a method call on the result of &cellClass, could I?

[13:44] <jnthn> There's not a way to pass the output of a template sub into another template sub, you'd get double escaping even if you did manage to make it work.

[13:45] <jnthn> You can however use a template macro, like <:macro foo><blah><:body></blah></:> and then <|foo><&the_template></|>

[14:21] <Xliff> jnthn: Are there any filter equivalents in Cro::Webapp::Template?

[14:24] <Xliff> jnthn: Or Can you apply a function on <:body>

[14:29] <jnthn> No; I've been considering ways to pass multiple "parts" into the macro and it can use them, but nothing done on that yet.

[14:32] <Xliff> *sign* -- OK. I will have to think about how I can work this application. I might need to use another templating engine for this specific part.

[14:32] <Xliff> Thanks for the help.
