[07:54] <patrickb> Not sure if my message went unnoticed so I post again: There are five PRs I have opened for various Cro projects (4x Cro:HTTP, 1x Cro::Core). Currently I routinely patch my Cro installations with those changes whenever I use Cro::HTTP::Client. Are people still aware of those PRs?

[13:18] <japhb> patrickb: jnthn and sena_kun are just about buried at $day-job at the moment, but I'll mention it to them when they come up for air.  :-)

[13:22] <sena_kun> patrickb, we're aware, but... time-quality-money triangle

[13:23] <sena_kun> jnthn can review them with quality, but no time, I have some time, but don't expect quality

[13:23] <sena_kun> personally, I'm pro merging them and doing a release, yes

[13:33] <jnthn> Merging those aside, I think the main release blocker for now is writing docs for things that are in the release.

[13:33] <patrickb> Then I'm fine with them sitting there a bit longer. I do want people to only do what they are willing and capable to do in OSS software. But I want to make sure things don't fail to get merged simply because no one noticed or people just forgot.

[13:33] <sena_kun> I'll do it this evening

[13:33] <sena_kun> writing the docs, I mean

[13:36] <patrickb> So jnthn, sena_kun, japhb keep on happy hacking!

[13:36] <sena_kun> patrickb, you too

[16:24] <lizmat> Q: was Cro 0.8.7 released this week, or was it released last November?  https://github.com/croservices/cro/releases/tag/release-0.8.7

[16:30] <japhb> 0.8.7 is older.  Yeah, last year

[16:31] <lizmat> then why did I see a tweet about it last week   ...  hmmm

[16:57] <japhb> Maybe someone saw it, or started using it?
