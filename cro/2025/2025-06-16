[13:57] <tbrowder> in the api query i'm trying, the curl example shows a header defined like this:

[13:58] <tbrowder> -H 'accept: application/json'

[13:59] <tbrowder> how is that translated into a Cro::HTTP::Client.new()?

[14:01] <tbrowder> another is: -H 'X-API-KEY: xxxx'

[14:02] <tbrowder> i assume it should be: accept => 'application/json', yes?

[14:02] <tbrowder> etc.

[16:54] *** disbot1 left
[16:54] *** disbot2 joined
[22:07] <disbot2> <tpaul64_18694> yeah that's what i would expect

[23:21] <tbrowder> thnx
