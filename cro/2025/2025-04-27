[11:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> japhb: I have checked the aria guidance (https://chatgpt.com/share/680e1491-2a8c-8009-ad72-e35177f89591) - it states <<After submitting the form with errors, move focus to the error summary div (role="alert") or the first errored field.>>

[11:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there is a bit of additional work to do on the current Cro::WebApp::Form prelude.crotmp to give it active focus controls (which I am not planning atm) ... since the default for a static form is to reload the page, focus is lost and will start at the top of the form, so this is likely why they are there atm

[11:52] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> however with htmx hx-post (which is what I am using) focus stays on the subnit button (which I prefer) - so i guess I need to add an error box placement option and leave the default alone
