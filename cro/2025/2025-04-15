[14:48] <SmokeMachine> Hi! I'm planing on creating a new Cromponent method called URL and if you have a cromponent called Todo (for example: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/lib/Todo.rakumod) and you do: Todo.URL, it would return: "/todo", if you do: Todo.new(:1id).URL, it would return "/todo/1" and if you do: Todo.new(:1id).URL: "toggle" it will return "/todo/1/toggle". That's very easy to be done because those routes are already added to 

[14:48] <SmokeMachine> Cro by the cromponent itself.

[14:52] <SmokeMachine> my problem is if that route is added from inside a include (like here: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/spreaded-routes.raku#L12 https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/lib/todo-routes.rakumod#L9) . Is there a way to, from the handler, know the @prefix included? or will I need to add a :@prefix to my URL method? That would couple too much the component with the route...

[16:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i can see the benefit of having the URL method … sorry I do not know the answer to your question …

[16:13] *** Pe_Elle left
[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i have taken the approach to specify a :base<base-url> on Todo.new … and that is then prefixed onto URL by Air::Component and is intended to match the HTML <base></base> tag operation the idea being that i can have a group of components used in a subsite with base xxx and then copy and deploy as a group to base yyy or a different site with different base location … since the route include has to have this info

[16:13] <discord-raku-bot> it seems like a logical place to set both params in top down fashion

[16:33] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I’ve done something similar here (https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/9522201093e6ed5ad60598798964d0d0023287cf/resources/todo-base.crotmp#L4). Maybe I’ll need to do something like that… but I would prefer to have a way to do that…
