[06:05] <SmokeMachine> I'm working on a utility (maybe a helper) to use with cro to make it possible to: by name (if the endpoint is a sub, or using the parameters to create the name) to refer to that endpoint, and have some methods on that (for now, it only has a path method). That way stuff like redirect may be much easier. What do you think? Does something like that make sense? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/usRRVIfb/image.png

[06:10] <SmokeMachine> I plan to add a `call` method that will run the block's endpoint and somehow add a `:endpoint` named parameter to `redirect` to receive the endpoint name and redirect to the right path.

[06:32] <SmokeMachine> this code with `redirect-to` is already working: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LEEewih6/image.png

[06:33] <SmokeMachine> does something like this make sense?

[19:53] <disbot1> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: well - tbh I do not quite understand the use case for this ... and on first pass I was quite worried that this is overloading too much into the routes block (which is already quite an overloaded raku concept) -- otoh, usually you are more knowledgeable about the "right" place to put code to make something work right! so I would say, please do provide some idiot level examples and docs - and go ahead and make a PR

[19:53] <disbot1> (in Cro::HTTP, I guess) and I would be happy to review...

[20:06] <SmokeMachine> I'm not planing on adding that to Cro, but to create a new module that you can use instead of Cro::HTTP::Router that will give you option to refeer to the endpoints, so, instead of having to, for example, hardcode a path for redirecting, you can use a name and just do the redirection without needing to know the path... you can even include that with a prefix and it will find it out...

[20:09] <SmokeMachine> make sense?

[20:13] <disbot1> <librasteve> Oh - OK ... I just figured that Cro::HTTP::RouterUtils would be released as part of Cro::HTTP from the Cro org on GH ... I would be happy with that (maybe you need credentials) or with what you have in mind

[20:14] <disbot1> <librasteve> on the content - I am the kind of guy that would need to play with the code to grok what it is doing
