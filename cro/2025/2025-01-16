[07:48] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I mean the only thing I see you are using from components is the `is accessible` and for that you are adding a lot of weird stuff for templates you are not using... maybe a better solution would be if I externalize the `is accessible` to a different module, use that module on cromponent and you could use that (the only thing you are using) on your Functional::Component (or whatever name you would like to call it). What 

[07:48] <SmokeMachine> do you think?

[15:23] <patrickb> The new release script and the announcement on the website are now also merged.

[15:24] <patrickb> The only remaining item: The `cro` distros release doesn't seem to become visible in the ecosystem. I've already pinged tonyo.
