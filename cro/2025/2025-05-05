[02:28] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> Is there any way to prevent spaces from being generated in templates? Right now I am cramming tags together for this and it's quickly becoming unwieldy

[02:30] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> the way space significance works in HTML makes this... frustrating to say the least

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Rog - heres the low level generator code

[14:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  method sequence-element:sym<literal-open-tag>($/) {         my @elements = flatten-literals flat             Literal.new(text => '<'),             $<tag-element>.map(*.ast),             Literal.new(text => '>');         make @elements == 1 ?? @elements[0] !! Sequence.new(children => @elements);     } 

[14:02] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my initial guess is that (i) Cro Templates are not generating space between HTML tags when they are generated and (ii) there are no controls over space insertion - so not sure what Cro Templates are doing that you don't like

[14:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please can you provide a good/bad example of the concern and post it on the GH repo issues

[14:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> PS. there is an internal control of trailing horizontal for generation  $.trim-trailing-horizontal-before = False, but that is not documented so I would have to dig in to see what it does

[14:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> @.landyacht. ^^ please see my initial guess above...

[14:14] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> Correct, the templates aren’t adding anything that isn’t there in the source. I just wish there were a way to have “insignificant” space in the source that doesn’t make its way into the output, e.g. for generating anchor tags immediately followed by punctuation like a period. I’m at work now but I can whip up a GH issue later

[14:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> example please ;-)
