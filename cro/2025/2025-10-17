[04:12] <disbot10> <simon_sibl> with Harc, how do I add route to allow download files ? because I succeed to add the link but then I get a 403 forbidden (so to allow while still preventing people from manipulating the url and get ../../../../../etc/foobar)

[13:48] <librasteve_> my recommendation for adding downloads in a Harc app is to make a new component with a download method

[13:58] <librasteve_> kinda like this (from the harcstack.org website / Air::Examples https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/pMDIrWAd

[13:59] <librasteve_> since you are anyway in Cro you can alternatively make a Cro route (in a route block of course)
