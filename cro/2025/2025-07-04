[16:13] <disbot3> <librasteve> @romdav55_30502 just reminding myself of the docs https://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-http-router#Producing_responses

[16:18] <disbot3> <librasteve> that also covers the three argument variant of redirect that lets you include a body this is precisely equivalent to calling content after redirect

[16:20] <disbot3> <librasteve> otherwise I am not entirely sure what you mean by "finish the request" ...I guess the standard behaviour of redirect() is to return from the route immediately ... on which case any code after the line contaniing the redirect() call will not run

[16:21] <disbot3> <librasteve> I have not tested this, you can check my guess by putting note 42 there which will send 42 to STDOUT / log
