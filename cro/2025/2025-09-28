[01:13] <japhb> Nice!

[01:14] <SmokeMachine> japhb: does that make sense?

[01:29] <japhb> I like the idea, yeah.  Seems like a different subspace than the places the `cro` tool itself covers

[01:31] <japhb> And one of the biggest reasons I use Raku in the first place is that it doesn't force unnecessary complexity on you.  So this feels quite nice.

[01:32] <japhb> (Where by 'you' in this case I meant 'programmers just trying to Get Things Done')

[01:52] <SmokeMachine> japhb: I agree, that’s one of my favourite reasons as well. :)

[10:56] <leont> Yeah that looks sensible

[12:08] <SmokeMachine> I’ve been wandering… librasteve_ might be right… maybe I’ll create a PR for Cro to add named endpoints…

[12:37] <disbot2> <librasteve> really liking Crolite

[13:29] <SmokeMachine> :)

[16:24] <SmokeMachine> I have a question to you all... the generated names for endpoints... if I have a endpoint like: `get -> "bla", Int $a {...}` what would be the best generated name? `GET_bla_Int_$a`, `GET_bla_Int`, `GET_bla_Int_a`, `GET_bla_$a`, GET_bla_a` or what?

[16:25] <SmokeMachine> I'm tending to `GET_bla_Int`...

[16:35] <disbot2> <librasteve> I agree, I think the name of the var is really internal to the block

[16:36] <disbot2> <librasteve> but need to keep anything used in the multi despatch

[16:38] <SmokeMachine> but the name of the parameter will not influence on the dispatch, right?!

[16:41] <disbot2> <librasteve> yes - that is why I agree that Get_bla_Int is good

[16:56] <SmokeMachine> I'm woring on a PR for Cro to add named routes to it... do you think it's a good idea?

[16:57] <SmokeMachine> for Cro::HTTP to be correct...

[17:13] <disbot2> <librasteve> yes, I strongly support this idea

[17:14] <disbot2> <librasteve> I would also welcome Crolite as a repo in the Cro organisation if you wish (no pressure, but I think it is a natural home for it if you agree)

[17:17] <SmokeMachine> Yes, I think that may make sense...

[18:36] <SmokeMachine> it's still a WiP, but this is how it's looking for now: https://github.com/FCO/cro-http/commit/8c4291c5de2c00e34daed9d92dcec779a9a6b71b

[18:37] <SmokeMachine> and for now it allows stuff like this: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/A4VSu3Ge/image.png

[20:08] <disbot2> <librasteve> .oO … that’s cool … is it dynamic (ie when the server is running)?

[20:12] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: it prepares a hash of names => handlers when it finishes the route {...}...

[20:13] <disbot2> <librasteve> =b

[22:25] <SmokeMachine> Does anyone know how to test redirect with Cro::HTTP::Test? I am trying with this, with no luck: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/commit/3e825f71395be2cc2350a55fcceedb3989f0bb8b#diff-7bd487c8af897ddfcaa00186e2f370603b5c92d66a6e09c99307acf2c1a9c902R44-R49
