[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> if I want to use <@foo>...</@> in a template, what would the call to template look like?

[22:50] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> it seems to only want a scalar initial-topic

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> oh okay it's just as simple as template 'file.crotmp', %{ foo => @foo } maybe

[22:52] <discord-raku-bot> <.landyacht.> yeah - thanks for rubber ducking everyone :^)
