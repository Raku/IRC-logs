[00:42] <SmokeMachine> I just merged the PR that changes the way to create Cromponents... I think that's better now. The code still needs many improvements, but the usage is near to what I want (still trying to figure out how to make not need to call <&HTML(.cromponent)>)...

[00:43] <SmokeMachine> I also updated the todo example with some css and made Todo Cromponent to be a Red model and store/load the todos from database

[00:48] *** Pe_Elle joined
[00:49] <SmokeMachine> There is also a new role/cromponent called StyledComponent to add styles by class on a react's styled components way... (it still needs some work...)

[10:49] <SmokeMachine> Just to point out that if anyone want to see use cromponents from GitHub, now it depends on https://github.com/FCO/CSS-Nested that is just CSS::Gramar extended to accept (and convert) CSS nested rules

[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: have you read this https://rstacruz.github.io/rscss/ ?

[22:23] <SmokeMachine> reading now. The way I've done that is based on styled-components for react (https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)

[22:33] *** Pe_Elle joined
[22:34] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: this (https://rstacruz.github.io/rscss/elements.html) is the reason I had to create CSS::Nested (that I'm going to release in a few... but still very early stage of development) (https://github.com/FCO/CSS-Nested)

[22:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i am very interested in this topic ... i look forward to learning a lot in coming days!

[22:46] <SmokeMachine> currently, if you make your cromponents `does StyledComponent`, add ` class=<.class>` to your outer most element, you can create a method CSS that returns a css string (with no selector), that will be used on your cromponent. if you call `StyledComponent.add-stylesheet-route` inside your route block, it will create a new ` /css`  route that will return your page's css
