[11:38] <patrickb> There is a test failure in cro-tls, probably related to a bug in the rakudo supply impl. I'll try to create a usable bug report and then proceed with the release.

[11:39] <patrickb> I've become reluctant to spend unreasonable amounts of time on fixing bugs prior to finishing the debugger I'm working on.

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine:  we have been on parallel paths (crotmp // functional) for a couple of weeks. Frankly I needed to take some time to flesh out my idea of what functional web components done in raku should look like. I am pleased to say that I have got my first proper example done and would like to use that to see if we can reintegrate our component efforts. There is a long form of this message at my example repo here

[16:48] <discord-raku-bot> https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Cro-Website-Basic/tree/main. Please can you review when you get a chance and then we can maybe discuss a way forward?

[18:41] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I’m still rereading it (I need to be sure I understood everything), but I have some points…

[18:45] <SmokeMachine> React hooks are more related to how to manage states than to how to “define” the html… even with hooks, you continue using jsx to define the html…

[18:48] <SmokeMachine> About functional programming: one of the main aspects of functional programming is being declarative, in that matter, I would say crotmp could already be considered functional programming

[18:54] <SmokeMachine> Currently Cromponent creates a Str method with its RENDER method return already compiled using Cro template engine. So, if you use your HTML::Functional to create html template, it will work with no integration needed…

[18:59] <SmokeMachine> You could also, just have a class where on the Str method you return HTML (using HTML::Functional), that if on a template, you use it like: `<&HTML(.your-object)>` it would already work as a component…

[19:08] <SmokeMachine> Your Person model could have a `^populate` meta method to be used to populate it with the default values, ex: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/b1f71184685c34c6152f16821a29ca6dfc7cc230/t/lib/Sentence.pm6#L23 and https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/b1f71184685c34c6152f16821a29ca6dfc7cc230/t/47-rypervenche.rakutest#L17

[19:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> thanks for taking the time to read and propose a way forward - it sounds like a good step for me to rebase my project onto Cromponent latest - I'll let you know how I get on...

[22:37] <SmokeMachine> About css, I don’t think the way to create components should mandate how to create/use css… it could/should have facilitators, but not force including anything…
