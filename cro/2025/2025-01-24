[17:57] <patrickb> not entirely sure, but I think the "cro" tool can do that

[19:20] <coleman> if you need to run a more elaborate script, try entr https://eradman.com/entrproject/

[19:21] <coleman> but I do think the cro tool does have a hot reload mode for template updates. I haven't used it for a while though 

[19:21] <coleman> it was a part of docs.raku.org before we went all-static

[19:58] <discord-raku-bot> <melezhik.> Yes cro app  when runs in dev mode does hot reload on changes in any file

[20:41] <xinming> Ok, thanks, I lost cro cli for a long while, and now, when I create project, I copy the skeleton to other folder, and rename modules.

[23:39] <Xliff> Hello!

[23:40] <Xliff> I'm trying to see if I can act on Cro internal exceptions when I am running a Cro server. Say an exception of type X::Cro::HTTP::Router::OnlyInHandler is thrown. Is there any way for me to act on that at the application level?

[23:41] <Xliff> Near as I can tell, it looks like Cro handles those internally and I can't even get a notice that such has occurred at the application logic level.

[23:44] <Xliff> *SMACK* -- there is Cro::UnhandledErrorReporter.... thanks anyways!
