[09:50] <librasteve_> SmokeMachine: iirc one of the tests does a loopback (eg to 0.0.0.0) [this can often break on a new install due to firewall and so on] … suggest you find this in and expand to cover redirect?

[16:42] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: FCO++ created pull request #207: Adding named endpoints

[16:42] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/207

[16:44] <SmokeMachine> ☝️ I created this PR, it probably isn't good enough, but I decided to PR it anyway to let you all to critic and comment on it and that way I'll be able to fix the problems (if it's interesting to have named endpoints on Cro).

[16:46] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: ☝️

[17:11] <SmokeMachine> if/when that's accepted I'll be able to update Crolite to not use RouterUtils and depends only on Cro...

[23:25] <SmokeMachine> It seems there is a PR that does what I’ve done on my PR, but it looks better and it seems to do more stuff: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/152

[23:26] <SmokeMachine> But it seems to be from 4 years ago…

[23:47] <SmokeMachine> Another thing, would someone like to review this one? https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/205
