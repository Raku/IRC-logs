[00:12] <SmokeMachine> japhb: Done and tests added

[00:13] <SmokeMachine> someone with permission could allow the tests to run on that PR, please?

[02:13] <japhb> I think I triggered it for the latest version of the PR

[02:18] <japhb> CI passed.

[02:19] <japhb> Ready for merge, SmokeMachine ?

[04:41] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> I am sure the code could be so much better, especially for the end goal xD but since I dont know much about hArc yet, thats what I do xD

[04:42] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> it basically will be a file explorer (later maybe add a system of permission but not sure at all yet), for now it shows every file at the same time like /some/dir/file another/path/file in the same table xD

[10:05] <disbot3> <librasteve> @simon_sibl - I have been able to take a quick look ... your repo was missing the pico node modules so I have made a PR to add them and then your site looks very nice! I can pass in a directory and see the filelist. I see that you have the Download method stubbed for now - but apart from that looks cool to me. TBH, I did not find anything to dislike in your code ... but then only a superficial look...

[10:06] <disbot3> <librasteve> I am not an expert in web sockets but it looks like you are over that pretty well

[12:35] <SmokeMachine> japhb: from my side, I think so. :)

[15:21] <japhb> SmokeMachine: 208 merged, 152 closed.  Can 207 also be closed now?

[15:31] <SmokeMachine> japhb: yes, please. And thanks!

[15:59] <japhb> Done, and you're welcome!

[16:03] <japhb> SmokeMachine: While we're here, what's the status of #205?

[16:40] *** librasteve_ joined
[17:23] <SmokeMachine> japhb: the t/ tests passes. and the code looks correct to me... but it might conflict with the last PR. I'll rebase it with master now...

[17:37] <japhb> Sounds good

[17:57] <SmokeMachine> I just rebased it. I also made `http` with multiple methods accept names as well (but a function that will receive the method being used) and a new test. The original test was on `xt/` and `xt/` is not passing locally, it fails with `certificate has expired`...

[17:57] <SmokeMachine> japhb: ☝️

[22:32] <japhb> There's a script to regenerate the certificates.  Long lived certs were banned by the browser makers, so now all the cryptography libraries changed defaults.  Sucks for test certs though.

[22:38] <japhb> Also, I think there's a good chance one of the PRs recently neglected to add a Changes entry, so before release we'll need to fill in any missing lines.

[22:41] <japhb> Ah no, Altai-man's PR just had a rather minimalist Changes update

[22:46] <japhb> OK, that's refreshed testing keys.  SmokeMachine please rebase on that ^^

[23:15] <SmokeMachine> japhb: rebased and pushed

[23:16] <SmokeMachine> everything seems to be working...

[23:22] <SmokeMachine> \o/

[23:22] <japhb> My feelings exactly.  :-)

[23:22] <japhb> This brings us down to 4 open PRs in cro-http

[23:28] <SmokeMachine> I think I'll try to take a look on them... maybe I can help somehow...

[23:29] <SmokeMachine> all of them should be applied, or any of them is out of scope?

[23:30] <japhb> Finally found the right tip on how to do this: https://github.com/pulls?user=croservices  # All open PRs in croservices org

[23:30] <japhb> So 18 altogether

[23:33] <japhb> SmokeMachine: Well, those that still make sense.  #114 looks like one that already had jnthn review, but was not merged after vendethiel pushed last

[23:33] <SmokeMachine> I'll take a look after I finish adapting Crolite to show routes list with out using RouterUtils, that module is not needed anymore...

[23:35] <japhb> SGTM, thanks SmokeMachine++

[23:36] <SmokeMachine> it seems #114 is very small, and seems to be just the case to create a new PR copying the diff (again .pm6 -> .rakumod problem)

[23:37] <japhb> OK, I'll close it when you open the new copy, and work from there on your version.

[23:51] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: FCO++ created pull request #209: Catch URI parse errors during routing (Copy from #114 vendethiel++)

[23:51] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/209

[23:52] <SmokeMachine> japhb: ☝️

[23:54] <japhb> One comment

[23:55] <japhb> Closed #114 now that #209 is live

[23:59] <japhb> Thanks for updating the PR; I'm just waiting for CI tests now
