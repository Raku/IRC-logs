[09:46] <disbot3> <librasteve> @simon_sibl ... sorry just noticed your point about upload ... I have been working on automating this here https://github.com/librasteve/harcstack-org.git ... which already works pretty well (imho) - so all you need to do is commit and then restart then docker-compose down, up on the server

[09:52] <disbot3> <librasteve> to use this for your site, just clone this repo and then replace the lib/ and static/ folders with your own site ... currently this uses the Cro service.raku to run the server ... so you may need to adjust the last line in the Dockerfile to suit your entrypoint ... eg CMD ["raku", "-Ilib", "dfs.raku"]
