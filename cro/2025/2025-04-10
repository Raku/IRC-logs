[02:31] <SmokeMachine> I tried figuring out a way to add htmx (and/or custom) attributes on Cro::WebApp::Form (like hx-post for example), but I couldn’t find a way. Is there a way? If not, is that ok if I create a PR adding a $!form-custom-attributes attribute to make it possible?

[02:35] <SmokeMachine> I meant %!form-custom-attributes

[16:06] <SmokeMachine> does that make sense ☝️?

[16:50] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: Yep - that makes perfect sense and would also be great for my needs. but I would like it to go further in that each input should be able to have custom (hx-) attrs ... maybe for example for dipping in a Red model to check availability of a desired username. This is a bit tricky since I guess it would need to be per input not per input type.

[16:53] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I note that when I go TestForm.empty.HTML-RENDER-DATA I get a prepared Cro template data sturcture that is then consumed by prelude.crotmp. My idea for Air is to consume the same data structure within an Air::Function class to make HTML. So I would request that anything you make respect this intermediate form slang and I can port over the prelude.crotmp changes.

[16:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> So having said that makes me wonder best way to specify the hx-attrs in my form class...

[16:55] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> What do you think about some thing like this:

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  role HxForm {     method hx-tags(--> Hash()) {         :hx-get("$.url-id/toggle"),         :hx-target<closest tr>,         :hx-swap<outerHTML>,     } } } class BlogPost does Cro::WebApp::Form does HxForm {     has Str $.title is required;     has Str $.content is multiline;     has Str $.category will select { 'Coding', 'Photography', 'Trains' };     has Str @.tags is attributed { |self.hx-tags } will select {

[16:59] <discord-raku-bot> 'Raku', 'Compiler', 'Landscape', 'City', 'Steam' } } 

[16:59] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: for the field validation, isn’t enough something like: `has &.nick is validated({ !User.^all.first: *.name eq $_ }, “Username already used”);` ?

[17:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: good point - sorry I was just trying to come up with an example - maybe my idea is overkill

[17:01] <SmokeMachine> I am planing on changing the form sub template itself and make it accept something like: `<$form(.form, :form-custom-attributes{ hx-post => $url })>`

[17:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - I think that's fine, at the <form hx-get...>...</form> level

[17:03] <SmokeMachine> I don’t think it should be defined on the Form class… the Form could be used on different parts of the page with different hx-… values on each of them…

[17:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I havent done any real messing with Cro forms yet and so I am currently vague what may be needed at the individual input level - my guiding star is to imagine all the HTMX examples somehow in a form, here's a typical one https://htmx.org/examples/bulk-update/

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> but this example would work with your solution

[17:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> let me check the other examples

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok I did site:https://htmx.org/examples/ form

[17:11] <SmokeMachine> And I’m thinking if it should be better to use a red model as a form (on the same class we define the red model and probably define the Cromponent (example: https://github.com/FCO/Discuss/blob/main/lib/Topic.rakumod) or if I should make it easy to create a record from a from, or none… I say that, because on this example: https://github.com/FCO/Discuss/blob/a8e27f99b509ef1479ceb14b18a7661ff8a35862/lib/Topic.rakumod#L20, the form 

[17:11] <SmokeMachine> being a model would not help… and it would just be easier to just do: `$.messages.create: body => $form.body, code => $form.code, author => %( nick => $form.nick )`

[17:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there are 3 HTMX examples involving form where children of the form element also need HTMX (or JS), these are:

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://htmx.org/examples/inline-validation/

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://htmx.org/examples/file-upload-input/

[17:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://htmx.org/examples/file-upload/

[17:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> The first one (as you mention) should be handled by the Cro::WebApp::Form is validated trait - I guess that there is a small possibility that the raku validation will not dance with the HTMX - I suggest to try your solution first and see how is works

[17:15] <SmokeMachine> In this 1st example, I think that div with the email address would just be a component, right?

[17:15] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> The other two are file upload specific and I think that when we get to multipart file upload maybe we will need to do something a bit more custom for eg progress bars - again I think we should stat with your solution and solve this later

[17:17] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> BTW I have implemented all these examples already with Cro Template (not Cro Forms though) at https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples

[17:19] <SmokeMachine> Because that validation is not being done on submit, but on change… it will not get the form data (only the email)… then I don’t think form could help there…

[17:19] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Well, maybe the email div is a component - but it is also an input - I am not sure how these two things can be combined tbh ... have you any thoughts on that?

[17:20] <SmokeMachine> On submit the email will also be sent… then form could help… the email would be validated twice on 2 different places… :(

[17:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I am 100% in agreement that a model is a Cromponent is a Form (with mixing traits on the has declarations) would be awesome (as in your Topic code)

[17:21] <SmokeMachine> Maybe we could extend form to validate each field when called…

[17:23] <SmokeMachine> I’m not sure about red being a form yet… :(

[17:27] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry maybe I did not explain well - I am looking at your topic code and thinking of

[17:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve>  model Message does Cromponent Cro::WebApp::Form is table {     has Str  $.body is column is multiline;     ...     method RENDER-FORM-DATA {       # form HTML you use within the Topic.RENDER as .form     } } 

[17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ^^ this is just a wild idea right now (well I guess you would use it as the data to prime the form Cro template

[17:33] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry must finish $day-job ... please do go ahead and make PR the way you think is best, I can help to review it then...
