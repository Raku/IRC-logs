[07:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Rog: since Cro::WebApp::Template v0.10.0 you can also use template-inline like this

[07:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> template-inline ‘<@foo>…</@>’, { :@foo }

[14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> on topic of Cro::WebApp::Form would anyone object if we moved the form level validations errors from above the input fields to above the submit button … at the moment with long forms it’s possible to hit submit and not see the form level errors since they are scrolled off the top???

[14:31] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes we could make this a setting in prelude.crotmp, but that’s quite intricate already and i would personally like to avoid adding more complexity in there

[20:02] <japhb> librasteve: There are a lot of cases where errors in long forms can be confusing.  I guess the #1 requirement for me would be "Screen readers can make some sense of this", because that usually implies some amount of semantic and/or ARIA correctness.
