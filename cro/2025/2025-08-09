[07:58] <wayland> Hi!  I'm getting the error at https://gist.github.com/wayland/db1296d170c073b9a9606b1e413ababb -- any suggestions?  

[10:34] <lizmat> looks like Cro::Tools::CLI is calling color <green yellow ...> at line 286, which the "color" sub does not support, as it only supports a single color to be specified?

[10:35] <lizmat> so presumably an issue on Cro::Tools::CLI ?

[10:48] <wayland> OK, I've created the issue at https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/169 

[10:48] <wayland> Looks like no-one has touched it in 7 months, and CI is failing.  

[10:49] <wayland> Oh, and the CI is also using version 2022.02

[10:49] <wayland> The really odd thing is that that command worked the other day.
