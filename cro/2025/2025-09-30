[10:33] <patrickb> SmokeMachine: Do you feel up to reviewing 152?

[10:36] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: I can try to, but it has merge conflicts…

[10:37] <patrickb> Aww. Do you think the PR is salvageable?

[10:39] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: I’ll need to spend some time on it to be able to answer that… :( sorry

[10:39] <patrickb> No worries!

[13:07] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> with Harc stack, is it possible to register route later ? basically when I press a button it creates new object on the page, and I need to add route for those

[13:07] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> (also if there is an easy way to delete previously created route/object, I would highly appreciate

[13:11] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> this is the code for now: https://glot.io/snippets/hblipllhyx

[13:34] <SmokeMachine> simon_sibl: you probably don’t want to create/delete multiple routes for that, but probably a single route that receives a part of the path as a variable and validade if there is a object represented by that variable…

[13:42] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> I found a way for the route, but it still increases the ID indefinitely.. https://github.com/4zv4l/dfs/blob/main/Web.rakumod

[13:44] <SmokeMachine> Maybe something like this:  https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Mm7C8mHn

[13:45] <SmokeMachine> Sorry, I didn’t read your answer before answering…

[13:50] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> no worries, I found a way, I assign the ID manually

[13:50] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> not sure if the loop is the best written tho https://github.com/4zv4l/dfs/blob/8ee3fbed5d0803124279d2a500e4f41ad0327849/Web.rakumod#L26

[13:50] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> I didnt know about Crolite, nice !

[14:09] <SmokeMachine> After work I’ll try to convert your code to Cromponent and see if I can help you somehow…

[14:15] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> you think Cromponent would be better than hArc (or it can integrate as well ?)

[14:17] <SmokeMachine> No, I’ll do that just because I understand better the Cromponent way of doing stuff…

[17:04] <SmokeMachine> patrickb: that branch seems to be working... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SdUu7E7o/image.png

[17:15] <patrickb> SmokeMachine: Oh wow! Nice!

[18:45] <disbot3> <librasteve> this is the way

[18:46] <disbot3> <librasteve> (you can also consider assigning :id(0) -- the convention I have in mind is that this means "there is only ever one of these")

[18:50] <disbot3> <librasteve> just found your GH repo ... I will do a review shortly and provide feedback ...

[20:13] <SmokeMachine> it seems the conflict on that PR was mostly on changing `.pm6` to `.rakumod` it was easier to me to create a new branch and copy the diff from the original PR to that branch. The tests seems to be passing...

[20:32] <disbot3> <librasteve> SmokeMachine ++

[20:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: FCO++ created pull request #208: Copy diff from `Support link generation #152` from 4 years ago to current code (Altai-man++)

[20:38] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/208

[20:40] <SmokeMachine> If someone could take a look at it...

[22:45] <japhb> SmokeMachine: It looks like jnthn's last comment from https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/152 never got addressed (trivial two line fix I think, just adding `next` lines for the two extra roles jnthn pointed out

[22:46] <japhb> Probably needs a couple tests to go with that fix too

[22:59] <SmokeMachine> Oh, yes, I did that on my copy of the original branch and forgot to do that on this one…
