[00:03] <japhb> <freddie-mercury>Another one bites the dust (hey-hey!)</>

[00:03] <SmokeMachine> :)

[00:04] <SmokeMachine> o|

[00:04] <japhb> Thanks for all your work SmokeMachine++!

[00:08] <SmokeMachine> #46 I'm not sure... because I don't think it would work if there is a `get -> "bla", Str $ble, "bli" {...}` and if there is a request for `/bla//bli`... I don't think that would set $bla to ""...

[00:10] <japhb> Yeah, that one seems a bit odd.

[00:16] <japhb> Closed #46 based on your point.

[00:17] <japhb> 2 left in cro-http, 16 overall

[00:28] <SmokeMachine> once we are here...

[00:51] <japhb> #210 merged, #126 closed.

[00:51] <japhb> You're on a roll, SmokeMachine  :-)

[00:52] <SmokeMachine> the last you is a bit more complex... I'll need to leave that for another day...

[00:53] <japhb> No worries, thankful for the work so far!

[04:06] <disbot3> <simon_sibl> I merge your pr 🙏 still need to figure out how to handle the upload, then I can focus on the actual Node code xD
