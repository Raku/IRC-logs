[00:35] <[Coke]> Having trouble getting a 400 error with a github API, and the docs for the page say that a client must support SNI for it to work.

[00:45] <[Coke]> ah, probably a red herring.

[04:42] <disbot1> <m_zero> Hi - I'm poking through the code base, as I need some very detailed information about operators.... Am I right in thinking rakudo/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp is still the actual grammar used to parse Raku source; and rakudo/src/Raku/ast is not yet used?

[08:16] <lizmat> if you look at grammars, then: src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp is used by default, and src/Raku/Grammar.nqp is used when the RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 env var is specified

[08:42] <disbot1> <librasteve> test

[11:53] <disbot1> <m_zero> Hrm... Okay... So which grammar is definitive?

[11:54] <lizmat> eventually (in 6.e when it is released) it will be src/Raku/Grammar.nqp

[19:03] <disbot1> <m_zero> Okay - so I will base my investigations on src/Raku/Grammar.nqp and src/Raku/ast/OperatorProperties.nqp that is uses... and assume that those are "intended truth" even if not exactly how the current implementation works.

[20:14] <lizmat> indeed
