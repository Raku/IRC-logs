[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrickb: ah ... the post merge CI run failed at ===> Installing: Cro::TLS:ver<0.8.10>:auth<zef:cro>:api<0> Error: The operation was canceled.

[09:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> (all tests failed the same way)

[09:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I see that you adjusted the ci.yml ... maybe that change is implicated? please can you review

[09:37] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have just gone zef uninstall Cro::TLS / zef install Cro::TLS successfully on my mac, lemme try the archive

[09:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah zef install https://github.com/croservices/cro-tls/archive/master.zip works fine on my mac

[09:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - its this The strategy configuration was canceled because "raku.macOS-latest_latest" failed

[09:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/main: 6a93830518 | librasteve++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | .github/workflows/ci.yml

[09:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/main: Update ci.yml

[09:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/main: 

[09:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/main: temporarily exclude macos from strategy

[09:44] <Geth> ¦ cro-webapp/main: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/commit/6a93830518

[09:49] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I temporarily excluded macOS form the ci.yml and now proceeds beyond the failing line ... so its a macOS config ... wonder if anyone else has seen this?

[09:51] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah ubuntu passed fine

[09:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/97 <= made an issue and checking who "owns" the GHA action raku.macOS-latest_latest
