[19:26] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrickbk: I note a lot of activity around the Cro release area ... do you have a release date in mind (I would like to evangelise the :fragment support to the HTMX community

[21:19] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: by that definition, I would say cromponent is a hybrid solution… it uses templates integrated into the language…

[21:20] <SmokeMachine> Anda about their example with react/jsx… I would say it’s closer to cromponent than the other options…

[21:30] <patrickb> librasteve: No, I'm still fighting with getting the release tested...

[21:31] <patrickb> Once I have it tested I'll release asap.

[21:31] <patrickb> But I'm short on time lately.
