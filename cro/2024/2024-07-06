[19:06] <coleman> hosting a version of the cro website here: https://cro.raku.org ; The code has been forked into the raku GitHub organization, and it's likely we'll want to keep it there rather than managing a new org. But please look for communication from the RSC on this in the near future. If you need me come find me on github.com/Raku/infra

[19:07] <coleman> The version that was deployed was built (as a containr) directly on the server from this branch https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/tree/dockerfile_update
