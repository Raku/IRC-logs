[19:37] <patrickb> librasteve: By when do we need the Cro-Webapp release latest? (There is a blog / advent post for it in the pipeline, right?)

[19:38] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lol - the post is scheduled for Day 3 (ie Tuesday) - but don't worry I have just said to zef github HEAD

[19:39] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> if you do have the chance to release let me know and I will update the post

[19:40] *** Pe_Elle left
[19:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> also when we release I will update the HTMX folk

[19:45] *** librasteve_ joined
[19:47] <lizmat> fwiw, we could move the blog post till later

[19:54] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> lizmat: thanks for the suggestion - on balance my preference would be to decouple these things as I don't want to put any unnecessary deadline on a Cro release (since there are likely several other things that are part of the new version) - but I don't really mind either way

[20:26] <patrickb> lizmat: I'm currently trying my hand on a release of cro-webapp.

[20:26] <patrickb> in META6.json, auth is currently zef:cro. Can this stay?

[20:28] <patrickb> also authors currently has only jnthn in it. What should I do with that? Leave it like it is? Add the releaser? Remove jnthn, add releaser? Add all sorts of people that commited stuff?

[20:38] <patrickb> if we want zef:cro to stay, I need to be added to that group.

[20:39] <patrickb> or do we change that to "zef:raku-community-modules"?

[23:34] <lizmat> patrickb: sorry, was afk

[23:35] <lizmat> changing to raku-community-modules is an option, but would advise against it

[23:35] <lizmat> better to make a zef:cro a group

[23:36] <lizmat> not sure if that could be done, perhaps create a group "raku-cro"

[23:36] <lizmat> and make yourself admin on that and add any people you think need release access

[23:37] <lizmat> and then change the auth to zef:raku-cro of course
