[13:46] <melezhik> I am playing with Cro WebSockets, seems like cro ws does some buffering befiore send data to client, can I disable it?

[13:55] <melezhik> or maybe this what browser buffers?

[15:12] <japhb> melezhik: That sounded vaguely familiar, so I looked in my Cro WebSocket code and found this commit: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core/commit/c7eb0861002b1a80a3d85add65728dad2fcc8203 -- Does that help illuminate the problem at all?
