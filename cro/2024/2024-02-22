[22:02] <SmokeMachine> Hi! does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? https://gist.github.com/FCO/e08b717af876276602428f8147c08b7e

[22:07] <SmokeMachine> it seems my request finds the correct route, executes it but continues trying to execute the other routes and then breaks...

[22:14] <SmokeMachine> This a smaller version of this (https://github.com/FCO/HTML-Component/blob/CroRouter/lib/HTML/Component/CroRouter.rakumod) where I got this error

[22:15] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: any idea?

[22:56] <lizmat> nothing jumps out  :-(

[22:58] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: `where` blocks are not closures; they're traits attached at runtime, so there's one static where block

[23:00] <SmokeMachine> But when I print inside of it, it prints the right valuesâ€¦ ðŸ¤”

[23:01] <SmokeMachine> https://gist.github.com/FCO/e08b717af876276602428f8147c08b7e#file-output-L1

[23:01] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: ðŸ‘†

[23:01] <jnthn> Try a `print` inside of the `where`

[23:02] <jnthn> The block is a closure, but a signature is not copied per closure

[23:02] <SmokeMachine> Thatâ€™s a say inside the whenâ€¦ https://gist.github.com/FCO/e08b717af876276602428f8147c08b7e#file-cli-L9

[23:03] <SmokeMachine> And it continues trying even after a True resultâ€¦

[23:07] <SmokeMachine> On my original implementation I had made the test a block and passed the block to the where: https://github.com/FCO/HTML-Component/blob/fc4286c3565c4d7c20dabbf696be50c6b8a80576/lib/HTML/Component/CroRouter.rakumod#L35

[23:09] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: ðŸ‘†

[23:18] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: I tried doing `my &where = -> Int $i, Int $actual { say "$actual == $i -> { $actual == $i }"; $actual == $i }` and used it on when like: `post -> Int $a where &where.assuming: $i {...}`

[23:19] <SmokeMachine> I 'm still getting: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bBAmBlLc/

[23:21] <SmokeMachine> is there a way to do that inside a loop?

[23:23] <SmokeMachine> or the only solution is have a single route and do the validation inside of it?

[23:23] <jnthn> Nol the `where` block is not a closure. You can try requesting /0 and /1 and probably observe it always compares against the same RHS

[23:24] <jnthn> It's either that or something EVAL-y

[23:25] <SmokeMachine> ok, I'll try that...thanks

[23:26] <jnthn> You can completely golf Cro out of it, fwiw

[23:26] <jnthn> raku -e 'my @x; ^3.map: -> $i { @x.push(-> $ where { say $i; $_ == $i } { say $i }) }; @x[0](0)'

[23:31] <SmokeMachine> yes... 

[23:31] <SmokeMachine> m: my @x; ^3 .map: -> $i { @x.push(-> $ where { say $i; $_ == $i } { say $i }) }; @x[0](2)

[23:31] <SmokeMachine> oh, sorry... no camelia... :(
